00:02 - um
00:05 - oh you know what would be good hello we
00:07 - might be live streaming right now
00:10 - um are there captions that are appearing
00:12 - obviously nobody's looking at the chat
00:14 - so we do have a little bit of a bug in
00:16 - our system
00:17 - um here what i'm going to do is say i
00:19 - have it up on my computer over there so
00:20 - first let me say a quick hello just
00:22 - assuming it's working
00:24 - but yeah if somebody has a phone and
00:26 - wants to like just go to it you'll be
00:27 - able to see the live chat
00:29 - um my name is dan schiffman
00:31 - this is a live stream that's happening
00:33 - on a youtube channel called the coding
00:34 - train but this is a little bit of a
00:35 - special episode in that
00:38 - um we i'm going to show you the itp ima
00:42 - winter show so it i itv is a graduate
00:44 - program ima has an undergraduate program
00:46 - at new york university school of the
00:48 - arts it's where i teach where i make a
00:50 - lot of the video tutorials that i have
00:51 - on the channel
00:52 - um
00:54 - people are saying the captions are there
01:02 - and so
01:04 - um we're going to walk around there's
01:05 - all there's like
01:06 - literally six of us here right now and
01:08 - we have the most elaborate setup ever so
01:11 - there's this microphone i should i
01:13 - should point out that this microphone is
01:15 - not actually something that you're
01:16 - hearing right now this is just recording
01:18 - backup additional audio it's actually
01:20 - probably way too close to my face right
01:21 - now it should be more about here
01:23 - this phone attached to it is also on a
01:27 - skype call with a live captioner give
01:29 - yourself a shout out live capture in the
01:31 - live captions who is live captioning i
01:34 - have a feeling the live captions aren't
01:35 - going to work so well this is the first
01:36 - time we're trying to do it but we're
01:38 - going to do our best and then the actual
01:40 - audio that you're hearing
01:42 - i'm tapping the mic so hopefully you
01:43 - heard like there's messages coming in so
01:47 - what i'm going to do right now is i'm
01:48 - going to
01:50 - take this
01:52 - prop which is like our microphone
01:54 - speaker it's like this what's the thing
01:56 - where you have like the speaker box or
01:58 - the
01:58 - you know when you're at like a meeting
02:00 - and you want people to speak one of the
02:01 - times you have to hold
02:03 - oh it's the top one the talking stick
02:05 - this is the talking stick
02:07 - which we will pass around um so i'm
02:09 - going to pass over these are our student
02:11 - show producers
02:13 - um
02:14 - i'm going to let them introduce
02:15 - themselves and talk about the show and
02:17 - idp and what it is and whatever they
02:19 - want and i'm going to go check just sort
02:21 - of like the the analytics page and the
02:23 - chat and all that make sure things are
02:24 - and then we'll start looking at projects
02:26 - thank you to ellen behind the camera
02:29 - chelsea and jesse over here are helping
02:32 - and i'll hand this to you bye
02:35 - hi everyone i'm i'm patrick warren i'm a
02:36 - first year itp student
02:39 - hi i'm daphne i'm second year itp
02:41 - student i'm a lighting designer cool
02:44 - and uh so i guess we'll walk outside and
02:45 - check out the show right so we're gonna
02:47 - say what we're doing oh what we're doing
02:54 - doing whatever they want we did a
02:56 - beautiful map together of all of the
02:58 - projects on the floor this year special
03:00 - because we have a beautiful space and we
03:03 - have more than 100 projects
03:05 - so that's a lot of projects to go
03:06 - through for a visitor so we made a map
03:08 - that has
03:09 - numbers laid out on a floor plan and
03:11 - then a description no not a description
03:13 - the name of the project the student and
03:16 - you know it's color coded according to
03:17 - where it is in the
03:19 - so that was our job yeah
03:22 - do you want to add anything i think she
03:23 - is
03:25 - so that's it
03:26 - should we go look at some projects let's
03:28 - go
03:41 - okay
03:43 - i'm like so like i don't have my phone i
03:45 - don't have my phone
03:46 - because it's over there
03:48 - um
03:49 - so
03:50 - i guess i'll take this now and i'll i'll
03:52 - get us rolling and then we can kind of
03:53 - like
03:54 - alternate around
03:56 - all right so we're gonna attempt now to
03:57 - look at projects students are still
03:58 - setting up their projects
04:00 - um but uh maybe
04:02 - is the boxing glove in action
04:05 - all right let's go check out the boxing
04:07 - glove
04:09 - so uh what we're going to attempt to do
04:12 - is um
04:14 - so ellen i think like the closer you get
04:17 - okay the better just for the audio
04:19 - and then um you can we're gonna like
04:22 - keep the camera on you and the mic on
04:24 - you just to do like describe the project
04:26 - and then separately you can demo it
04:28 - because as soon as we're trying to like
04:30 - shoot video of demoing it we'll lose
04:32 - your audio sure okay
04:34 - say your name and your project and then
04:36 - a few sentences about it uh hi my name
04:40 - is punch punch revolution basically what
04:44 - it is is a machine learning gesture
04:46 - classifier on the under the hood but on
04:49 - the hood if as you can see it's a fun
04:52 - punching game where you need to complete
04:53 - a certain amount of tasks in a limited
04:55 - amount of time
04:56 - uh the entire technology is happening
04:59 - inside this very small thing over here
05:01 - as a demo
05:02 - and if somebody wants to try it out we
05:04 - can have a go at it
05:08 - should i try or do you want to
05:09 - demonstrate oh i can demo it yeah okay
05:16 - so basically if i need to make a
05:18 - significant enough gesture ideally it
05:21 - should
05:36 - so that's how it roughly books and the
05:38 - general purpose of the entire project is
05:41 - to
05:42 - uh
05:43 - go into us like early deep dive into
05:45 - like what can be possible just using
05:48 - people's gestures as a medium of
05:50 - interaction
06:03 - okay
06:10 - all right so
06:11 - introduce yourself say your names and a
06:13 - few sentences about your project
06:15 - hi my name is
06:20 - and this is our project
06:22 - general photography so basically it's an
06:25 - experiment we did like to figure out
06:27 - what's in between analog photography and
06:30 - digital technology so what you're seeing
06:32 - now is
06:34 - the result of our experiment
06:37 - so we ran a journey through from the
06:40 - very basic analog photography
06:44 - the pinhole cameras where you expose
06:46 - a piece of light sensitive paper to
06:49 - light over a certain period of time and
06:51 - then you can capture out light expose
06:54 - the paper
06:55 - and how it carves these like
06:58 - the traces of line on this piece of
07:00 - paper and then we try to reproduce the
07:03 - same process by using a digital way so
07:05 - basically for example we have a series
07:08 - of images
07:09 - and then we use the technique that is
07:12 - used in analog photography to expose a
07:14 - digital canvas with the images from that
07:17 - series of
07:20 - maybe for example for a performance in a
07:22 - dense
07:23 - images from a dance performance and then
07:25 - we did the negative
07:27 - analog negative of that these printed
07:30 - results which turn out
07:32 - you could have like this
07:34 - a piece of photography which is
07:37 - digital based but it has the texture and
07:39 - aesthetics of an analog photography and
07:42 - here's the video showcasing
07:44 - like the digital exposure process
07:47 - during the whole digital print like how
07:50 - it is made digitally
07:53 - yes
07:55 - okay i'm getting a bunch of this phone
07:57 - is buzzing like crazy which i assume
08:00 - it's not it's somebody who's instagram
08:01 - messaging
08:03 - this phone is it going today are you
08:05 - going today hold on
08:08 - there's somebody this is a an official
08:10 - nyu phone that i think someone left
08:12 - their instagram signed in on but let me
08:14 - uh let me try to look at the skype
08:15 - because i think
08:17 - the captioner is sending me some
08:18 - messages
08:19 - let me look at the chat
08:25 - all right this is me testing uh speaking
08:27 - directly into the money
08:34 - okay
08:38 - this is perfect
08:44 - shoot that separately and then move on
08:46 - to getting cool detail uh hi my name is
08:48 - noah um and um
08:51 - so we're trying to because we're we're
08:52 - doing like a lot of live streams let's
08:54 - do it at different things hi my name is
08:57 - noah i'm a first year at itp um and my
08:59 - project is sort of about uh video
09:01 - collage and machine learning
09:05 - fantastic but i don't know why i just
09:06 - did this yeah
09:08 - cool all right so give us a i give you a
09:10 - demo yeah okay so basically what's going
09:11 - on here are there our live stream
09:14 - streaming cameras on the floor
09:15 - and you can play with them so what i'm
09:17 - gonna do right here is if we look at
09:18 - stream three you can see all of us
09:21 - right now and i'm gonna make our heads
09:22 - appear on our sort of body collage so by
09:25 - using this controller
09:29 - come on
09:32 - oh right it's it's stream three i
09:33 - changed it to stream one so there we go
09:36 - in one second and there we go so now
09:38 - it's all of our heads as part of this so
09:40 - i can make our bodies show up too
09:42 - um stream three
09:44 - so in a second you'll see a big orange
09:46 - blob hopefully for shiffman's body
09:49 - i wore this orange sweater specifically
09:52 - for this demo
09:54 - let's see if i can get it to swap there
09:55 - we go
09:56 - so it allows you to play with these
09:58 - streams to sort of create a human
09:59 - collage if you know the game exquisite
10:01 - corpses
10:02 - um the colloquial version of that is the
10:04 - game that you play with drawing pictures
10:06 - that was an inspiration for this
10:10 - thank you thank you so we checked the
10:11 - blue blocks
10:14 - are you activated with your blocks
10:16 - you're having a nice like cup of tea or
10:17 - something okay coffee okay
10:20 - so tell us your name and a few sentences
10:23 - about your project so my name is demis
10:25 - and my project is basically a black
10:28 - puzzle game when you can build the
10:30 - correct sentence the animation is
10:33 - basically a hint about what is the
10:35 - sentence and you have to slide the
10:38 - blocks into the box to complete that
10:40 - sentence let's see can you show us a
10:42 - demo of it yeah so
10:58 - yeah and the tomato is bouncing
11:02 - and then you pass to the next sentence
11:04 - you have to use the green box in this
11:06 - case
11:07 - so you can remove this one
11:13 - this is basically like a learning tool
11:16 - for kids the
11:20 - cara
11:23 - no say that try again
11:25 - so
11:40 - thank you
11:43 - okay
11:44 - like my goals okay great great my goal
11:47 - is to like uh do as many projects as
11:49 - possible so with this previous years we
11:50 - would so i'm kind of we're just doing
11:52 - the rapid fire
11:54 - okay
11:55 - um tell us your name in a few sentences
11:57 - about your project and then we'll kind
11:58 - of go and look at some of the uh
12:00 - specific parts because there's so many
12:01 - yeah um hi i'm winnie um and so these
12:04 - are
12:05 - from my data class i'm from hong kong so
12:08 - i did a lot of projects about the
12:09 - protests and specifically focusing on
12:11 - the narratives um i'm really interested
12:13 - in non-traditional um approaches to
12:16 - protests um and the focus of narrative
12:18 - is because i feel like our ability to
12:20 - craft our own narrative is something
12:22 - that's really powerful and healing um so
12:24 - these are all different projects about
12:26 - um narratives and distances
12:29 - um
12:30 - yeah sorry um no so this two projects
12:33 - are about police and um protesters uh
12:37 - and so i have these youtube videos that
12:39 - i scripted transcript um from and i did
12:42 - these generative texts uh and also with
12:45 - the most common words i made these
12:48 - fridge magnets that people could
12:50 - interact with
12:51 - and then this piece here is all the
12:54 - protest information i have consumed from
12:57 - september up until now
12:59 - so as you hover you could see the
13:01 - articles
13:02 - and the brighter the box is the more
13:05 - articles i have read
13:07 - in that hour of the day and then the
13:09 - last one
13:11 - there is more about media rendering
13:14 - because a lot of times when we read the
13:16 - same information
13:17 - we could have very different
13:19 - interpretations so i was curious to see
13:21 - if i could create a system for us to
13:23 - even understand that um so what i did is
13:26 - that i create
13:28 - this framework where i have
13:31 - this article
13:32 - which is compiled by a number of
13:34 - pro-china and pro-hong kong media
13:37 - articles um and i asked people to select
13:40 - the three most important sentences
13:42 - and then to type
13:44 - uh words and response and also pick uh
13:48 - the headline images that they think is
13:50 - the most appropriate
13:51 - and also ask a little bit about whether
13:53 - they have been following the protests
13:55 - and after they did that they could see
13:57 - everyone's
13:58 - responses
14:01 - thank you
14:02 - okay i'm gonna just uh because i'm
14:04 - feeling very paranoid i'm gonna see if i
14:06 - can get the youtube chat going on this
14:08 - phone also i'm just gonna check speaker
14:11 - has to be closer to the mic so we're
14:12 - gonna do our best let's see we're going
14:15 - to do a little check-in maybe you're
14:16 - saying a lot of important things in the
14:18 - chat
14:19 - so i don't know how to use this phone
14:20 - youtube
14:28 - search this is a really cool project
14:31 - okay good
14:32 - i'm more looking for people saying like
14:34 - the stream's not working i can't hear
14:36 - anything
14:37 - um but the chat looks good okay
14:41 - okay great no it's all going very well
14:44 - usually the chat is just full of people
14:46 - com not not complaining complaining is
14:48 - the wrong word very nicely
14:50 - providing constructive
14:52 - critique about what the technology is
14:54 - not doing properly but i think we might
14:55 - have finally got all the right pieces
14:57 - here all right
14:59 - yeah we come in here okay
15:01 - so we're kind of doing this quick
15:04 - uh rapid fire glimpses of everybody's
15:06 - projects so they can tell us your names
15:09 - uh in a few sentences about your project
15:11 - and then we'll also go around and shoot
15:12 - some footage more closely and i can see
15:14 - that it's much longer than it was
15:15 - yesterday yes
15:17 - i'm naila davis and i'm simone salvo and
15:20 - we also have another collaborator
15:22 - elizabeth perez who's not yesterday but
15:24 - together we all may say her name which
15:26 - is an interactive portrait it's
15:28 - commemorating the life of sandra sandra
15:30 - bland commemorating and celebrating her
15:32 - life so what we did was used um these
15:36 - this process called internal
15:42 - total
15:43 - internal reflection
15:44 - and we printed this image on lucite so
15:47 - the idea is that when you walk past the
15:49 - sensor it'll detect that you're there
15:51 - and when you say her name
15:53 - sandra bland
15:56 - this will end up printing
16:02 - if it goes well
16:04 - we've been having some um
16:08 - some some small technical difficulties
16:10 - with our ultrasonic sensor so as
16:12 - everything at itp this has become a um a
16:16 - prototype more than a finished piece and
16:18 - we're really learning through this
16:19 - experience of having people see it like
16:21 - what we would do differently how we
16:23 - would change it and also seeing how it
16:25 - changes as people interact with it for
16:27 - sure like when the first roll of paper
16:30 - came down it was like okay what do we do
16:32 - now right let's just leave it so
16:35 - i want to try to say it again say
16:38 - sandra bland
16:41 - p5 is hearing you
16:50 - but i guess you guys
16:52 - come back another i know you're gonna
16:53 - have to come back it's printed this many
16:55 - times there is a delay also so sometimes
16:58 - when you say the name it'll end up
16:59 - printing
17:00 - um but we've also noticed that this
17:03 - ultrasonic sensor in communication with
17:05 - p5 causes some type of lags that we
17:08 - can't necessarily
17:09 - detect
17:16 - and sometimes you know the the medium of
17:18 - digital media shows through
17:22 - and we get that
17:25 - we'll fix it all in post
17:28 - thank you great job congratulations
17:30 - thank you for sharing thanks guys
17:41 - hello
17:42 - tell us your name and a few sentences
17:43 - about your project yeah hi my name is
17:46 - and i work this with clingy
17:51 - it's called behind a toe so you have to
17:54 - go to the back of the tube to see the
17:56 - detector project
17:59 - so what can you just give us the
18:00 - explanation first and then we'll go look
18:02 - behind you okay um so people always look
18:04 - at the front of the talk and we want
18:05 - people to actually see what is behind
18:07 - and what's the relationship between
18:09 - people who have been passed away and
18:11 - people who are alive and visiting them
18:13 - so uh the movement and also the sound of
18:16 - the people who are alive will actually
18:18 - if that's what the topes movement
18:21 - be like we want to use this to talk
18:23 - about the relationship and discuss that
18:25 - so that's it
18:56 - instagram notifications
19:24 - hello uh tell us your name and a few
19:26 - sentences about your project oh this is
19:27 - a vr project this will be hard but you
19:29 - can but there's you have excellent
19:31 - display of extra information fantastic
19:32 - it's marcel oliver yeah so it's my name
19:34 - and it's a vr project that's like based
19:37 - on compositional experimentation in vr
19:39 - unfortunately i'm not sure quite how to
19:41 - show it right you're welcome to look at
19:43 - it yourself yeah i'll come back i would
19:45 - love to see it
19:46 - um but yeah it's
19:48 - kind of a non-narrative art piece
19:53 - thank you
20:08 - so we're doing quick uh summaries of
20:10 - people's projects i'm very excited about
20:12 - this so just tell us your name
20:15 - names uh maybe stand next to each other
20:16 - if that's okay um and then we'll get you
20:18 - doing a quick explanation then we'll
20:20 - also then show people the project oh
20:21 - yeah okay i'm chanel
20:23 - i'm eating and this is our game
20:25 - authentic or not um it is a cooking game
20:28 - that teaches you how to cook traditional
20:30 - indian and chinese recipes
20:33 - and now we can just show you the
20:35 - how it works
20:37 - push the button
20:38 - and then drum rolls
20:40 - so now we are choosing chinese green
20:43 - pepper with pork
20:45 - and you can either use your hands or
20:47 - spoon to choose whatever you think
20:50 - is
20:51 - right for the dish
20:54 - and then
20:59 - keep growing
21:00 - now is the
21:06 - [Laughter]
21:13 - to get the traditional recipes and learn
21:15 - more about our project on our website
21:18 - and if you get more than 60 percent we
21:20 - are gifting some indian and chinese
21:21 - snacks yes yes
21:25 - thank you so much yeah thank you so much
21:31 - all right uh oh we got all three okay
21:35 - tell us your names
21:37 - about your product
21:38 - hold on let's let's hold it take it from
21:39 - the top it's so fast we need the
21:41 - microphones yeah i'm sure
21:44 - yeah
21:45 - and we made
21:47 - our believable news project and this is
21:49 - an installation
21:51 - and
21:53 - and about fake news yeah and
21:56 - basically you can see the news before
21:59 - you wear these glasses and if you wear
22:01 - these glasses you can see a piece of
22:04 - news and it says hong kong high court
22:06 - band black holes in public space and
22:08 - where 30 people were arrested and this
22:11 - image actually looks totally makes sense
22:13 - for this uh news that if you change to
22:16 - another glasses
22:17 - you can see a different version of this
22:19 - news
22:21 - this is our secret here yeah i can touch
22:23 - here and trigger this
22:25 - and you can see
22:27 - another piece of news happening in
22:28 - berlin also makes sense for this image
22:31 - and if you change to another glasses and
22:33 - you can see also see another group it
22:35 - says customers in shanghai fight for
22:37 - shirts and
22:39 - people will don't know which is true and
22:41 - which is fake and after they say
22:45 - sing all of the news and they could
22:47 - share this news to other person and
22:50 - this is those three are the news they
22:53 - sword and
22:54 - if i want to share like
22:56 - a high court band black clothes in
22:58 - public space and i can just share it if
23:01 - i share it and it will tell you it is a
23:04 - misinformation or the real news and yeah
23:07 - the message you just shared will appears
23:09 - on other people's screen and
23:12 - the message you just shared with other
23:13 - people will affect other people's uh
23:16 - final decision about which is real and
23:18 - which is fake so we made this project
23:21 - basically we want to let people to know
23:26 - to to question the genuineness of the
23:28 - image because many people think the
23:30 - image actually are the evidence of the
23:32 - events so and so the second step for our
23:35 - project we want people to
23:39 - know that actually their behavior is
23:41 - affecting
23:42 - other people
23:44 - they are not only the consumer of fake
23:46 - news they are also the
23:48 - enhancer of the
23:49 - fake news influences yeah
23:52 - thank you thank you thank you
23:55 - thank you i like it we're all applauded
24:02 - all right we're just going to keep going
24:03 - through all these projects all right
24:05 - tell us your name in a few seconds about
24:06 - your project my name is jason and i'm
24:08 - the creator of this project it's called
24:10 - optimize optimize is a
24:12 - tailor made mouse designed to fit
24:14 - everybody's head so
24:16 - um so this is the prototype
24:18 - uh the electronics i made all the like
24:21 - industrial design and also in the
24:23 - tronics coating and everything i start
24:25 - from here it's a dummy mouse and
24:28 - i
24:29 - model it on top with play-doh
24:32 - so it fits my hand perfectly so i did
24:34 - some photogrammetry which is powered by
24:37 - machine learning and reconstructed the
24:39 - model
24:40 - into
24:41 - a digital scan of my hand and it turned
24:45 - into a real mouse model and get 3d
24:48 - printed so it becomes
24:50 - the model you see here so it's a
24:52 - ergonomic mouse and
24:54 - because a mouse is the most dependent
24:57 - peripheral which is uh to your hand size
25:00 - and grip so this is the perfect solution
25:03 - for me and hopefully it's going to be a
25:05 - business in the future
25:06 - thank you congratulations
25:08 - okay
25:10 - oh yes let's take a look at this
25:19 - oh
25:21 - can you guys come and talk about your
25:22 - project yeah okay let's let's let's get
25:25 - you giving a quick explanation and then
25:27 - we can try to demo it and get some
25:28 - footage all right say your name first
25:30 - too you do my name
25:33 - my name is cezar khan
25:35 - and our project is called the joys of
25:37 - being a screensaver and it's an
25:39 - interactive video installation with four
25:40 - channels of video and one rotary phone
25:43 - uh the concept is that a human is stuck
25:46 - as your screen saver and you can
25:48 - interact with her by calling her on the
25:50 - rotary phone
25:51 - and by her calling you on the phone and
25:54 - it's just the back and forth between the
25:55 - real world and the digital world between
25:57 - you making the character move on the
25:59 - four screens around you and
26:01 - fur making you turn around
26:06 - all right should we try it we got
26:07 - somebody trying it already
26:16 - this is so good
26:23 - [Music]
26:43 - yeah so she's behind me
27:00 - so
27:15 - that's so cute
27:17 - so now i call back right
27:33 - what number am i dialing you can dial in
27:35 - two five seven
27:37 - okay
27:51 - oh she's here
28:13 - that's it right i did it right
28:18 - hello all right we're coming over here
28:20 - tell us your name hello and a few
28:22 - sentences about your project
28:24 - my name is hayek
28:25 - my name is tonic
28:27 - our project called artifice
28:29 - is about
28:30 - we can try to testing that human can
28:32 - live with a robot in the future and
28:34 - robot can replace human or not so our
28:37 - concept is the test that you have to
28:39 - identify who is a human and who is a
28:41 - robot it's a mother it's like a turing
28:44 - test but in a vr environment so we try
28:46 - to embrace a human connection between
28:48 - two people in vr so i would like to demo
28:51 - you
28:52 - we need one person who is going to be
28:53 - the actor and one person is going to be
28:55 - the judge i
28:56 - guess
28:58 - okay and we need we need one we need one
29:01 - more to be a judge
29:03 - so your mission is try to
29:05 - help him identify that you are human
29:08 - okay but among the experience there's a
29:11 - lot of robots
29:12 - that look like you okay and try to
29:14 - pretend to be you okay so you have to
29:16 - give them a clue that hey this is me
29:19 - okay i'm the human i'm human i'm human
29:22 - you're a robot oh i'm a robot but
29:26 - yes that's right that's right
29:28 - so
29:29 - i will set you up here okay
29:32 - and i need one person yeah to be a judge
29:35 - right
29:36 - so
29:36 - in this we combine like we are
29:38 - experienced and server client so you're
29:42 - going to be the server you're going to
29:43 - be the judge okay
29:45 - so you don't have to do anything okay
29:47 - you just observe i can do that
29:50 - and uh
29:52 - and you can identify he's a human or not
29:54 - at the end of the game usually
29:56 - take off your headset and then you come
29:59 - out and say
30:00 - is that you all right
30:12 - [Music]
30:18 - did you see anything i see it yeah
30:24 - this is the point of view that you will
30:25 - see for me
30:54 - oh they're dancing dancing yeah
31:06 - [Laughter]
31:16 - yeah i was
31:20 - okay
31:22 - so do you know
31:23 - which one is a human
31:26 - i was thinking the one on the right but
31:28 - i don't know i can't tell you so you
31:29 - think the one on the right yeah yeah
31:40 - so how do you feel that you get tricked
31:41 - by the machine
31:43 - machines are too smart man
31:47 - you help him identify yes
31:49 - yeah i didn't you know i think i if i
31:51 - had a second chance i think i might have
31:52 - more of a sense of like what some
31:54 - strategy might be i was just even going
31:56 - into the vr headsets no disadvantage
32:07 - but do you think like his movement is
32:08 - different than others than other robots
32:11 - in the center well i guess i was
32:13 - thinking about the road on the right so
32:14 - i started once i like thought it was
32:15 - that when i started focusing on that one
32:17 - more um so i kind of ignored the other
32:19 - two after a while um
32:21 - i guess i was also trying to figure out
32:22 - how that would move
32:25 - from what i've seen
32:34 - sid isn't here but this is a really fun
32:36 - a little arcade i can explain this
32:38 - project or do you want do you guys know
32:40 - about this project okay so this is
32:42 - project from sid
32:43 - who's not here maybe we can come back
32:45 - again to introduce it but it's a it's a
32:47 - small arcade um that's built with an
32:50 - arduino inside and you can select a
32:51 - whole bunch of different games it looks
32:52 - like they're
32:53 - playing tetris right now so take a look
33:04 - it's really cute
33:12 - looks like we have a professional tetris
33:13 - player here
33:16 - okay let's uh
33:18 - should we go around here
33:21 - there is
33:26 - all right hello can you give us a couple
33:28 - sentences about tell us your name in a
33:29 - couple sentences hi i'm borah uh so this
33:31 - is variations on computational
33:32 - association i'm feeding in my artwork
33:34 - and the neural network is trying to
33:36 - guess what it's saying and then recreate
33:37 - what it's saying
33:39 - uh but the premise of premise is it has
33:41 - to create something so it has to take
33:43 - liberties and combining stuff that
33:45 - hasn't seen combined before so it's sort
33:48 - of inadvertently creating some abstract
33:50 - art
33:51 - in in response to my art which is
33:53 - similar to what we do how we react to
33:55 - abstract ideas
34:08 - if
34:29 - okay
34:35 - are you using runway yes
34:40 - this probably is quite involved yes but
34:43 - can you give us a quick summary of the
34:44 - game of the project and then we'll like
34:46 - shoot some stairs but i don't know we'll
34:48 - have time to play it but pretty much
34:49 - it's just an old-fashioned board game
34:52 - uh
34:53 - i'm trying to solve the problem of our
34:55 - major games i have to deal with strategy
34:58 - and family being together
35:00 - namely
35:01 - monopoly risk and murder
35:03 - not having to deal with war
35:06 - murder or
35:08 - or bankruptcy
35:09 - so my game is called jackrabbits and you
35:12 - play with regular poker cards and
35:14 - basically what you're trying to do is
35:16 - that you're these rabbits that live in
35:18 - this kingdom and not trying to find a
35:20 - king a queen and a jack to officiate the
35:22 - wedding in this in the in the castle it
35:25 - comes with tiles so every time you play
35:28 - you create a different kingdom a
35:29 - different board and in the game what you
35:32 - do is you navigate through it trying to
35:34 - find the royal cards so in that sense
35:36 - it's like you're collecting properties
35:37 - like you would do with monopoly but
35:39 - instead of like trying to get your
35:41 - your opponent to go bankrupt you're just
35:43 - trying to
35:44 - arrange this wedding before they do
35:46 - did you make all of these pieces i made
35:49 - everything and design and everything um
35:50 - it's made out of mdf and it's laser cut
35:54 - and this is just like a sticker
35:56 - photo
35:58 - uh printed with a
36:00 - inkjet printer
36:01 - and i built the digital version of the
36:04 - board with v5
36:06 - which you can actually put together and
36:08 - rotate it i'll show you let me restart
36:11 - it
36:17 - the idea is that um
36:21 - if i still have to figure out how to get
36:23 - this into production
36:25 - maybe do a kickstarter but in the
36:27 - meantime i'll put this online and people
36:30 - will be able to play with their own
36:32 - uh poker card so if you have a deck of
36:34 - cards you don't need to wait for me to
36:36 - produce the actual board to be able to
36:39 - play john graves awesome great job i
36:42 - really want to come and play it yeah
36:44 - [Music]
36:47 - what you don't know is lachlan was our
36:49 - sound check person yesterday
36:52 - they've really rehearsed uh their
36:54 - project description not really but okay
36:56 - so tell us your name which you have
36:57 - already uh spoiler alert lachlan and uh
37:00 - a little bit a few sentences about your
37:02 - project hey so i'm lachlan i'm a
37:04 - first-year student here at ima uh and so
37:06 - i made a website called gun funded and
37:08 - it's a visualization of the gun lobby's
37:10 - funding of u.s congress
37:12 - cool do you want to like screw i mean
37:14 - people can go what's the url for the
37:15 - project it's gunfunded.com so maybe we
37:18 - can get a little footage of you
37:19 - scrolling through it but yeah
37:21 - so on the website you can enter your
37:23 - home address to find your representative
37:26 - or you can explore so here we are in
37:28 - brooklyn um and so unsurprisingly our
37:32 - representative here is not funded by gun
37:34 - rights groups those received a little
37:36 - bit of money from net control groups
37:38 - but you can also
37:40 - see some of the top funded congress
37:41 - people or you can explore by state um
37:44 - and so
37:45 - like where i'm from in pennsylvania um
37:47 - you can you can see the total um and how
37:51 - the funding is disproportionately um
37:53 - goes to uh republican men in congress
37:57 - and so you can go to anyone's profile
37:59 - you can share these
38:01 - you can see lists of top senators
38:02 - representatives
38:04 - and
38:06 - more and there's also a view of the pacs
38:09 - that give money
38:10 - so you can see
38:12 - that um like in 2018 there was 22
38:14 - million given to congress but in 2016 it
38:17 - was 58 million and so basically every
38:20 - year up until um just recently the
38:23 - graphs looked like this
38:25 - um because congress has received about
38:27 - 40 million dollars from gun rights
38:29 - groups
38:30 - and about 5 million from gun control
38:32 - groups and so you can also click to
38:34 - filter the list and see like how much
38:35 - money the nra specifically is given
38:37 - every year um or or any other group so
38:40 - that's gun funded and it's gunfunded.com
38:43 - thank you
38:45 - thanks
38:49 - hello
38:50 - will you
38:51 - tell us your name in a few sentences
38:52 - about your project yes my name is
38:54 - veronica alfaro this is a
38:57 - this is a breathing exercise
38:59 - so the way that it works is
39:02 - you
39:04 - squeeze the ball and you inhale at the
39:05 - same time that you
39:07 - release the ball and you exhale you're
39:08 - supposed to follow the pattern that this
39:11 - hexagon is giving you and there is also
39:13 - some sound coming out of the
39:15 - headphones that is also guiding your
39:17 - breathing so the idea is that people can
39:20 - have some sensory input at the same time
39:22 - some visual input to
39:24 - calm and relax and this is targeted for
39:27 - people with anxiety and who are
39:29 - suffering from a lot of anxiety before
39:33 - wonderful job i can attest i tried this
39:35 - yesterday and it really helped me calm
39:37 - down in a wonderful way

41:00 - i could take over if you want i've got
41:01 - lots of negative things to say oh god
41:04 - no about myself
41:16 - the key to happiness is in accepting
41:18 - your thoughts all of them even the bad
41:20 - ones accept your thoughts don't become
41:22 - them understand for instance that having
41:24 - a sad thought
41:25 - even having a continuous succession of
41:27 - sabbath is not this is so nice
41:30 - so it says it took you 12.7 seconds to
41:32 - say something negative
41:34 - 4.5 seconds to say something positive
41:37 - racing cards by emily's hour thank you
41:40 - yeah of course this is really nice

42:16 - frames with which to represent
42:18 - okay
42:20 - there was a little boy trying this
42:21 - yesterday
42:24 - so i have two frames
42:39 - and as more people come and add frames
42:42 - then you can read more and more of the
42:44 - story
42:45 - and try to understand
42:47 - based on their gifts and how people
42:49 - chose to represent the words and
42:51 - if you've tried to understand then you
42:53 - compare it to the original story
42:59 - it's really fun i wouldn't have thought
43:00 - you would get so much out of just two
43:02 - frames yeah but it's it's amazing it's

47:03 - spacecraft that is okay
47:05 - the instructions are in your console
47:07 - because you need to do them before the
47:09 - countdown is over otherwise you will
47:11 - damage the ship
47:12 - too much damage and we will all die did
47:15 - you get that good starting preparation
47:18 - sequence in five four three two one
47:21 - new instructions you have 50 seconds
47:50 - new instructions you have 45 seconds
47:58 - [Music]
48:00 - uncovered
48:18 - cool foreign right all right
48:21 - still 10 live instructions you have 40
48:24 - seconds no that's the bottom you're off
48:26 - to a great start the engine is
48:29 - [Music]
48:40 - [Music]
48:49 - [Music]
49:01 - new rios
49:02 - you have 27 seconds
49:05 - the motors are turning faster
49:10 - [Music]
49:23 - new instructions you have 24 seconds
49:26 - slide over the top
49:28 - slide
49:32 - uh
49:36 - [Music]
49:55 - is
50:12 - [Music]
50:36 - you can accomplish anything
50:47 - up
51:00 - [Music]
51:06 - you have eight seconds
51:12 - [Music]
51:19 - [Applause]
51:33 - thank you for praying
51:49 - tell us your name in a few seconds sure
51:50 - hi i'm adrian bautista a second year
51:53 - graduate student at itv
51:55 - um i built this project called public
51:56 - message which is meant to explore you
51:59 - know how do physical locations and
52:00 - augmented reality
52:02 - shape public discussions um so basically
52:05 - i mean if you want to do a quick demo
52:06 - yeah let's tell us tell us the spiel and
52:08 - then because it's sort of sure
52:10 - the audio will be lost i mean i guess
52:11 - it's becoming more common now for air
52:13 - content to appear in public spaces from
52:15 - like pokemon go
52:16 - to the jeff kuhn snapchat collaboration
52:19 - but then the question of like who
52:22 - kind of controls that space
52:24 - like
52:24 - is it the platform or is it the people
52:27 - who create the content or is the people
52:29 - who actually own the space or if it's a
52:30 - public space is it the government um
52:33 - so just kind of want to kick out that
52:34 - conversation as ar becomes more and more
52:36 - popular
52:37 - more prevalent um so what i did was i
52:40 - built
52:41 - a little app where
52:43 - i'm just a simple qr sticker you just
52:46 - any smartphone that can read a qr
52:51 - it'll open up a web ar experience so
52:53 - there's no app you have to download or
52:54 - anything
52:55 - it gives you a little pointer about how
52:57 - to set it up
52:58 - start it and when you point it
53:01 - and so there's a little
53:03 - prompt and then you could always reply
53:06 - to say like i wouldn't i wouldn't like
53:08 - sponsor content on my door
53:26 - the content there so people can kind of
53:28 - discuss in a physical space
53:30 - that's there but not really there
53:33 - so yeah fantastic great job thank you
53:49 - uh
53:50 - tell us your name and a couple sentences
53:52 - about your project i'm jenny i'm a
53:54 - second year icp student my project is an
53:57 - ar audio visual healing system that take
54:00 - you through my love story in new york
54:02 - city
54:02 - and most of the stories happen in
54:04 - washington square park so the experience
54:07 - is actually mapped in washington square
54:09 - park and how the real experience is that
54:11 - you follow this transparent tube and it
54:14 - will lead you to a location where
54:16 - there's this big reveal of like
54:17 - self-love it's kind of like a metaphor
54:20 - of how when people are in relationship
54:22 - there's like tunnel vision they only see
54:24 - one point and it's like you know when
54:26 - people are doing are there focusing on
54:28 - their phone and it looks ridiculous for
54:30 - people from the outside and hopefully
54:33 - hopefully in the end with the big reveal
54:34 - people can take in the beauty of the
54:36 - world and we focus on themselves that's
54:38 - why it's self-love yeah
54:40 - would you like to try
54:42 - yeah um yes so the audio only comes
54:45 - through the headphones yeah yes
54:48 - so
54:49 - because it's mapped to washington square
54:50 - park that's why you can only experience
54:52 - the very last bit of of the experience
54:55 - like the revealing part and it's not
54:57 - mapped here so you have to be careful
54:59 - not to bump into people
55:02 - if you wanna try okay let's try for a
55:04 - couple minutes
55:16 - so do you see the transparency
55:19 - and how you play the audio is by putting
55:21 - a tube in the middle of the screen
55:23 - to make it solid
55:25 - that's the only time when the audio will
55:26 - play
55:27 - and then this is the the revealing part
55:45 - but yeah you can see where the tube is
56:01 - it's a very large scale so you can walk
56:03 - like way
56:12 - is it a circle
56:14 - it was supposed to be in the park so it
56:16 - would be a walk but just not
56:34 - so that's why i have the documentation
56:36 - video on to tell you what the real
56:38 - experience supposed to be like
56:41 - [Music]
56:47 - okay
56:49 - thank you let's come over here
56:51 - uh tell us your names and a couple
56:53 - sentences about your project i'm maya
56:55 - and i'm kara
56:57 - i our project is a data visualization
57:00 - that uses augmented reality to um
57:03 - look at housing unaffordability in the
57:05 - lower east side in manhattan um so why
57:08 - do you want to show your home yeah
57:10 - so um basically if you pick up this ipad
57:14 - um and you look at the map
57:16 - side um it's gonna show you a hundred
57:18 - people then if you click on this little
57:19 - icon in the corner it will bring up some
57:21 - facts so first it's gonna show you the
57:23 - median
57:24 - um side then it's going to show you what
57:24 - apartment rent
57:28 - the immediate
57:30 - income is in that same area and there's
57:32 - a pretty stark contrast of
57:34 - those two numbers
57:35 - and then it shows you how that actually
57:37 - affects people's ability to live in that
57:38 - area
57:39 - so it talks about this thing called the
57:41 - 40 times rule and the 40 times rule
57:43 - states that you must make 40 times a
57:45 - monthly rent in income per year in order
57:47 - to be allowed to rent so this is
57:48 - something that happens when you're
57:49 - applying for a new place
57:51 - so if maya goes ahead and closes it
57:55 - but we wanted to show the disparity of
57:56 - the people that are living in this area
57:58 - so slowly they start to fade away and
58:00 - this is to show you that of the
58:02 - population of 158 000 in the lower east
58:04 - side truly only eight percent of them
58:07 - would be able to live there according to
58:08 - the 40 times rule
58:10 - and so that's what remains
58:14 - thank you
58:16 - all right let's go over to
58:20 - all right hello there will you tell us
58:22 - your name and a couple sentences about
58:24 - your project and then you can demo it as
58:25 - well okay i'm eva i'm a second year at
58:27 - itv um and so i made a chrome extension
58:31 - that goes over a browsing page and
58:33 - highlights the co2 emissions that are
58:35 - produced during um
58:37 - during internet use internet browsing so
58:40 - i can show you if you want
58:42 - basically
58:43 - this chrome extension adds these bubbles
58:45 - to the tops of
58:47 - any webpage and when when you load a web
58:49 - page a new bubble appears and the size
58:51 - of the bubble estimates the grams of co2
58:54 - that's produced um during that paid load
58:57 - um and then it sort of it calculates the
59:00 - grams of co2 produced during this
59:02 - browsing session and sort of tries to
59:04 - estimate the standard the
59:07 - miles that you could drive emitting that
59:09 - same amount of co2
59:10 - in a standard car
59:12 - uh so all these numbers are very much
59:14 - estimates because it's something that's
59:16 - very hard to quantify but
59:18 - this was
59:19 - more sort of to show people outside of
59:21 - the itp community that don't really know
59:23 - about this to make them realize that the
59:25 - internet has physical consequences
59:28 - so yeah
59:29 - is it available in the chrome store not
59:32 - at the moment because i want to fix some
59:33 - of the numbers but um
59:36 - yes at some point and then i also just
59:38 - for fun um
59:40 - looked at the
59:41 - uh how many sort of api calls are made
59:44 - for
59:45 - twitter and like every second and then i
59:48 - also mapped my own
59:50 - um
59:51 - browsing throughout the week and just to
59:53 - see how many grams of co2 using my
59:55 - memories to see
59:57 - how much i'm producing
60:04 - how are you doing there ellen does your
60:05 - arm need to break maybe yeah because we
60:07 - could do some switching we could switch
60:09 - a room
60:11 - [Music]
60:24 - might recognize the song
60:33 - i don't know if this made it in on
60:35 - purpose or by accident
60:37 - it's still not sure it's a
60:38 - [Music]
60:41 - first coincidence i think of that i can
60:43 - download the patches
60:44 - okay there you go all right sorry to
60:46 - lead with that maybe all of you who
60:48 - worked on this could you gather in one
60:50 - spot
60:52 - and then um just tell us your name and a
60:54 - few sentences about your project
60:56 - okay my name is roy yeah
60:58 - i'm karen
61:01 - so this product came from that we found
61:03 - the electronics are so fascinating
61:05 - so we want to change them into other
61:08 - playful machines
61:09 - and we found all these things in the u.s
61:12 - u.s store like we bought the old
61:14 - friendly and the old tables and the old
61:17 - turntable
61:18 - and then we made this fan into a record
61:21 - player and that telephone into a rocket
61:24 - mode game and that turned over into a
61:26 - bubble machine actually it's a happiness
61:29 - generator machine
61:31 - great should we try each of them one at
61:33 - a time yeah sure yeah
61:35 - so this one is it mocks up the
61:39 - experience of playing a vinyl player and
61:41 - turns it on
61:43 - and then
61:44 - this is for changing the speed of the
61:46 - music
61:52 - [Music]
61:58 - okay
61:59 - [Music]
62:06 - uh okay then this is the workable game
62:09 - if you press this button
62:11 - the game will start and you can use the
62:14 - receptor to watch them anybody want to
62:16 - try
62:18 - like this
62:21 - [Music]
62:28 - did i break it
62:31 - [Music]
62:34 - [Applause]
62:35 - [Music]
62:37 - okay
62:43 - [Music]
63:06 - and then
63:17 - oh you are shooting the secrets
63:22 - [Music]
63:38 - cool
63:42 - hold on
63:51 - okay so tell us your name before you put
63:53 - it on or tell us your name in a few
63:54 - seconds about your project okay yeah so
63:56 - where should i be looking are you
63:58 - looking wherever you want okay but you
63:59 - can look here um i'm andrea and so my
64:02 - project's a vr project um and it uses vr
64:05 - to tell a poetic experience about sorry
64:08 - about
64:09 - kind of exploring flashbacks and what it
64:11 - means to have control over our own
64:13 - experiences and memory yeah
64:15 - wonderful does anyone want to try it off
64:18 - yeah yeah of course you've done videos
64:22 - so you can adjust the headset
64:24 - and the interaction's super easy
64:26 - um you can just press
64:30 - take your time
64:33 - let me know if you need help
64:36 - i think i'm good okay
64:38 - yeah so super easy it's just a mouse
64:41 - press here i'm gonna put it in your hand
64:42 - okay this
64:47 - is you're gonna want to go towards the
64:50 - end
64:51 - but as you go on maybe you're not going
64:53 - to want them
65:17 - it's weird that you guys can see what
65:18 - i'm doing
65:42 - oh
65:58 - oh there's more okay cool all right
66:06 - um so that man that you see is supposed
66:07 - to represent trauma so the first time
66:09 - you go through this experience it's like
66:11 - going and walking around and you make
66:13 - something horrific happen um and now
66:15 - this part is supposed to represent how
66:17 - memory will kind of try to understand
66:20 - that so the memory if you've ever
66:22 - unfortunately experienced something like
66:23 - that
66:24 - you might replay that memory in your
66:26 - head over and over again um and if he
66:28 - ever chooses to stop he can stop time
66:31 - and stop everyone from moving but he can
66:33 - never prevent what's gonna happen and so
66:35 - he is like looping this memory and it's
66:37 - i just thought vr was a really cool way
66:39 - to describe such a
66:42 - specific experience with our minds and
66:44 - allow people to become immersed and also
66:46 - think a lot about that experience in a
66:47 - different way yeah wonderful thank you
66:50 - great job
66:53 - i'm just trying
66:56 - to keep going
66:58 - quite
67:02 - [Music]
67:27 - um so my name is eric
67:29 - i had this project it's called bouncing
67:31 - ball karaoke
67:32 - and you basically have this ball
67:34 - and like every time it bounces it goes
67:36 - like one word further
67:39 - i can show it
67:40 - i
67:54 - lyrics and that's a pretty long intro 30
67:57 - seconds
68:09 - and like um time you hit the words you
68:11 - get like one point uh so
68:14 - i would say like seven more seconds
68:20 - all right
68:33 - okay
68:39 - [Music]
68:42 - so i feel the battery kind of dies
68:45 - [Music]
68:48 - but basically yeah every time it bounces
68:49 - it goes like one more further um
68:52 - and i can kind of
68:54 - maybe show it like without you know
68:57 - yeah so i guess that's it
69:00 - it is
69:01 - still your favorite song
69:03 - uh no i feel this is a song that kind of
69:05 - everyone knows
69:07 - so but not everyone seems to know it
69:09 - actually like but i think like 90 of the
69:12 - people here know it so it's
69:14 - yeah it's it's a fun song and it's also
69:16 - like really difficult to sing it in like
69:17 - a karaoke bar but like i'm trying to
69:19 - make like everyone able to actually sing
69:21 - it by while hearing the voice the actual
69:23 - singer and trying to hit it on like the
69:25 - right rhythm
69:27 - um
69:27 - yeah and i feel better that gets showed
69:29 - like working i have to change the
69:31 - battery which takes a while
69:35 - you changed the ball right yeah so
69:38 - basically it was like a rubber band
69:40 - yeah yeah it was oh yeah you're so easy
69:42 - for you to replace the bathroom yeah it
69:45 - is it is and it was very close up like a
69:47 - working prototype with like fully uh
69:49 - rubber
69:51 - but yeah unfortunately it's just this
69:53 - um well yeah all right thank you so much
69:56 - thank you
69:58 - jake
69:59 - jake
70:03 - uh
70:03 - hi so can you tell us your name and a
70:05 - little bit about your project sure i'm
70:08 - jake sherwood uh my project is called
70:10 - climatescape it's a
70:12 - kinetic art installation to raise
70:14 - awareness for climate change and the
70:15 - human effect on the climate it's
70:17 - representing four future potential
70:20 - climate change scenarios going from best
70:22 - case to worst case so as you progress
70:23 - through the installation it gets more
70:25 - and more chaotic
70:27 - cool
70:28 - so do you want to demonstrate it
70:32 - this is kind of producing more tranquil
70:36 - uh
70:37 - softer sound and then as you get through
70:39 - it gets more chaotic and becomes scary
70:41 - at the end
71:17 - can you talk a little bit about what the
71:18 - rcp
71:20 - values are uh sure so
71:25 - the rcp stands for representative
71:27 - concentration pathways it's actually a
71:29 - data modeling set that the the
71:31 - inter-governmental panel on climate
71:33 - change is opted for scientists around
71:35 - the world to be able to have a baseline
71:37 - for modeling specific climate change
71:39 - data points but it has these four
71:41 - various scenarios which allowed me to
71:43 - kind of paint a picture of best case the
71:45 - worst case for what will happen in the
71:47 - climate if we do everything to kind of
71:48 - correct the problems that we have or if
71:50 - we do nothing and all kind of
71:55 - cool all right thanks very much
72:14 - we have to be very close because of this
72:16 - okay so where uh can you tell us your
72:18 - name and a little bit about your project
72:20 - yes uh should i see the camera yes okay
72:23 - hi um my name is jacob i work with
72:26 - chiwen she's not here right now so
72:30 - our project is called around us
72:33 - it's about
72:34 - something that around us also around the
72:36 - earth
72:37 - so you can see here
72:40 - so when you wake up you always check the
72:42 - weather or when you want to go new place
72:45 - but you don't know where it is you have
72:47 - to use the map
72:49 - like google maps or atom maps but all
72:52 - those technologies are based on the
72:53 - satellites but we never think about that
72:55 - so we want to make some awareness
72:57 - through this project so they're there
73:00 - so we use open source data called the
73:03 - union of
73:04 - concerned scientists
73:06 - based on these data we made
73:08 - three visualization
73:10 - so first one is the
73:13 - timeline shows the
73:15 - from 974 to 2019 how many satellite
73:19 - launches
73:21 - based on these four categories severe
73:23 - government
73:24 - and commercial and military and you can
73:26 - see there's some question marks in here
73:28 - because this open source data is chosen
73:30 - by them so we actually don't know how
73:32 - many satellites launched during this so
73:35 - we pick some random numbers from this
73:37 - data and
73:39 - we want to show the so there's something
73:41 - more
73:42 - beyond this data
73:44 - and also based on this data there's a
73:46 - called world map visualization
73:49 - it shows uh how many satellites uh own
73:53 - each country each countries
73:55 - oh and how many satellites so obviously
73:57 - united states lead this industry
74:00 - so there's some lagging in my computer
74:02 - but at final
74:04 - united states has like more than 900
74:06 - satellites
74:08 - and the final one is called the
74:11 - satellite showing the
74:15 - what kind of satellites around earth
74:18 - so if when you hover the mouse to the
74:21 - satellite you can see the
74:23 - detail of satellite images and lifespan
74:26 - operators who owned these satellites and
74:28 - also we printed out this
74:30 - to as a some kind of trading card like
74:34 - mba or mlb
74:35 - like we don't wanna
74:37 - make this too serious we just wanna
74:41 - make people more like just fun
74:43 - and a little bit of awareness about
74:45 - they're there like
74:46 - something around us
74:48 - yes that's all great job thank you thank
74:50 - you
75:09 - this way
75:12 - [Music]
75:31 - hello my name is matt ross i'm a second
75:33 - year at itp and i'm here to to talk to
75:36 - you about your
75:38 - relationship with your data daniel
75:40 - do you think you have a problem with
75:42 - data hoarding
75:43 - yes do you just every day wake up
75:46 - generate google documents spreadsheets
75:48 - pdfs and even powerpoints that are just
75:52 - living and sitting in your cloud
75:53 - services
75:54 - yes so what i have here today is a
75:57 - simple outlet but it's not just a simple
75:59 - outlet this outlet is connected directly
76:02 - to the servers at google and what it
76:04 - does is it looks for any documents that
76:06 - you haven't even looked at in over two
76:08 - years so let's say you gave a
76:10 - presentation just two and a half years
76:12 - ago
76:13 - is that really something that you need
76:14 - in your life is this something that's
76:16 - really sparking joy
76:17 - this project is sort of my my first step
76:21 - in trying to have a better relationship
76:23 - with my data and hopefully all of our
76:25 - data and so what you can do here today
76:27 - is one of two things you can take the
76:29 - extreme route authenticate pull the plug
76:32 - and delete everything that's older than
76:34 - two years here is a video of me doing
76:37 - exactly that
76:38 - and you can say i have a lot of useless
76:40 - stuff here
76:41 - um that i haven't looked at
76:43 - but that's a little bit extreme so i
76:46 - have made an alteration to this to kind
76:48 - of let us take the first step
76:51 - into a more healthy relationship with
76:52 - our data so what you can do today is
76:56 - log in
76:57 - and it will find just one single file
77:01 - and it'll show you what that file is and
77:03 - if you're ready you can pull the plug
77:05 - and it'll delete just that single file
77:08 - and maybe just let you take a step
77:10 - towards having data in your life that
77:11 - really makes you feel good and that it's
77:13 - important to you
77:14 - would you maybe want to uh i would but
77:16 - i'm going to have to two factor in my
77:18 - phone's over here yeah yeah we might
77:21 - need it
77:22 - you know what uh just for this for the
77:23 - sake of speed i can do it myself and
77:25 - i'll delete a one of my own files live
77:28 - in live stream so i'll show you how it
77:30 - works so obviously a big a big issue is
77:33 - privacy and keeping things safe so this
77:36 - all the code is open source and you can
77:38 - see how everything is working all the
77:39 - credentials are only stored just for
77:41 - this the sole
77:43 - time of the experience and
77:45 - um all the browsers are in incognito
77:47 - windows no sessions or anything get
77:49 - saved so you start it up
77:51 - you have a nice ascii art
77:53 - you have a blank page log in
77:57 - [Music]
77:57 - [Applause]
78:06 - oh there we go
78:08 - all right don't don't worry about that
78:10 - it's a friendly suggestion
78:13 - so here are these
78:14 - these this is just the amount of things
78:16 - that any google chrome extension would
78:18 - ask of you
78:20 - allow
78:21 - okay
78:22 - so now the script is activating
78:25 - and it's see it's retrieving all
78:27 - documents from a year and a half ago
78:29 - and i have 10 total files that i haven't
78:32 - looked at in over 18 months
78:34 - and
78:35 - this is a file called life retro
78:38 - which
78:39 - i think has some life goals from a few
78:41 - years ago
78:42 - you know what i'm here at itp things
78:45 - going well let me uh let me get rid of
78:47 - this
78:48 - so
78:49 - here's this plug
78:50 - and when i pull this i'll have six
78:53 - seconds to change my mind
78:56 - see it's going gold
79:02 - you can still change it
79:04 - i think
79:05 - deletion of one file
79:08 - and
79:12 - and that's the whole process
79:13 - yeah i wanna i've i this is giving me a
79:16 - lot of anxiety yeah i feel like i need
79:19 - to like
79:20 - fully dive into this at some point
79:21 - totally
79:22 - and uh you know it's we should
79:24 - definitely talk but we have we have
79:26 - another uh
79:27 - we have i have another project here that
79:29 - i've worked on with the lovely diamond
79:30 - alkas which is a lot less invasive oh
79:32 - what a nice segue yes oh let's come over
79:34 - here welcome to our partnership here
79:37 - you've introduced yourself and now you
79:39 - can introduce yourself
79:41 - and uh tell us a few words about your
79:42 - project sure i'm donna i'm a second here
79:45 - uh here at itp and i've worked together
79:47 - with matt we developed a new team called
79:50 - url data
79:52 - where obviously you can see healthy data
79:54 - starts here
79:56 - and we really wanted to raise awareness
79:58 - of the browser hygiene and the fact that
80:00 - we are constantly
80:03 - keeping our bodies clean and whenever we
80:05 - leave the public space we hand sanitize
80:07 - our hands but our phone is no less
80:10 - public than the train and our browser is
80:13 - no less public than the train or any
80:16 - place that we're visiting so we want to
80:18 - show you uh something that we've
80:19 - developed in the past few weeks
80:22 - i'm going to take my phone
80:24 - here
80:26 - and
80:26 - i'm going to scan this qr code
80:30 - it's going to send me to a safari
80:31 - webpage
80:32 - um nothing too fancy about it it's just
80:34 - the p5 sketch asking me insert your
80:37 - phone into the container now
80:39 - i'm going to uh
80:41 - turn on our machine
80:44 - and put this lovely little phone in here

80:53 - history so i'm gonna come here to this
80:55 - corel lovely perel and i'm gonna
80:58 - use it and if you would take a look here
81:01 - my browsing history has been cleared
81:05 - and that's it we really encourage you
81:07 - all to think about doing that every time
81:09 - that you use a hand sanitizer now do you
81:11 - wanna add something about this yeah
81:13 - again this is just the first step to
81:15 - having a cleaner more healthy lifestyle
81:18 - and just like healthy hands start here
81:19 - with bureau healthy data starts here
81:22 - with our machine
81:24 - thank you i feel like this needs to
81:26 - permanently live like on the floor next
81:28 - to the actual purell we also think we're
81:30 - gonna talk with it okay so you need an
81:33 - advocate for that yeah sign me up i'll
81:35 - sign the petition

83:03 - of explores yayoi kusama's
83:07 - she has a lot of installations that are
83:08 - based off of infinity so i wanted to
83:11 - kind of play with that concept in
83:12 - virtual reality which is a truly
83:14 - infinite space so we made a few
83:16 - different rooms that you can just
83:18 - explore endlessly and you can just get
83:21 - out whenever you want
83:23 - thank you for sharing
83:35 - all right can you tell us your name

83:46 - called the shape of evil and it's a
83:49 - detective horror game
83:51 - uh yeah
83:53 - so do we need any content warning or
83:57 - no it's okay i think we're fine this is
83:59 - a horror game if anybody is uh
84:01 - concerned maybe skip ahead one minute
84:07 - can you play somebody for us okay
84:10 - okay
84:12 - like you can see i'm controlling an
84:14 - agent now
84:15 - yeah
84:16 - and i'm investigating the accident here
84:19 - yeah i can find a dead woman here
84:22 - oh and i saw the
84:24 - information about this dead woman
84:27 - and while i'm present here queue against

84:33 - thank you so much okay
84:35 - thank you
84:36 - thank you
84:37 - okay
84:37 - now we're ready over here
84:40 - [Music]
84:43 - all right can you do a quick
84:44 - introduction yourself first sure
84:46 - my name is nikhil kumar i'm a first year
84:49 - student here at itv
84:52 - the piece is a sound piece
84:56 - that is exploring a restless mind one
84:59 - thought at a time
85:00 - so when my mom starts uh
85:03 - she'll hear nothing initially but
85:06 - uh after removing each of these pieces
85:08 - and burying it in the dirt she'll start
85:10 - to hear more and more but she won't hear
85:13 - the entire musical composition until
85:14 - everything
85:16 - is removed
85:18 - and i'll just leave it at that i'm
85:19 - curious great okay
85:23 - okay left right
85:25 - just take a seat take your time
85:28 - and remove these one at a time and bury
85:31 - them here
85:32 - and that's it
85:40 - up
85:48 - [Music]
86:02 - [Music]
86:12 - well
86:45 - i think with 15 of them you basically
86:47 - never have anybody experience it the
86:49 - same way
86:50 - so they're they're hearing little bits
86:52 - and pieces of the entire composition
86:54 - as they remove things but
86:56 - now that she's removed everything
86:59 - she's going to hear the the full musical
87:01 - composition so it'll just
87:02 - run and eventually loop so people will
87:06 - ultimately get to the same experience
87:07 - but
87:08 - after taking everything out thank you
87:10 - thanks cool thanks
87:12 - right here
87:15 - tell us your name and a couple sentences
87:16 - about your project oh hi i'm rebecca and
87:19 - this is our like computer media
87:22 - final so this is kind of like a
87:24 - collective data visualization that
87:27 - visualizes your harvest as clocks
87:30 - the metaphor behind is that your clock
87:32 - is ticking so it's just like you're live
87:35 - and it's like more confidently looping
87:37 - and just it cracks and clocks and fades
87:39 - away so we want you just use your
87:41 - process like your heartbeat to
87:44 - create a unique part for you so let me
87:46 - show you
87:48 - what experience
87:52 - so gently put your finger tip on there
87:55 - so
87:56 - it will detect your harvest
88:01 - uh
88:41 - jump to the clock town so here you can
88:43 - see your
88:44 - unicorn
88:48 - there will be a unique plotting ticking
88:50 - sound for you
88:52 - and then you put your name here like my
88:54 - name is
89:16 - [Music]
89:18 - you will hear all kinds of
89:22 -  so it'd be very beautiful to
89:25 - hear all kinds of
89:26 - like other people's lives like
89:30 - and
89:31 - we're very inspired by the clock
89:33 - installation part
89:35 - made by humans since 1920 98
89:39 - and this is the thing
89:41 - thank you very much
89:49 - okay can we uh can you tell us your name
89:52 - and a few sentences about your project
89:53 - all right my name is ben mall i'm a
89:55 - first year ite student and uh i created
89:58 - a lighting designer stage
90:00 - assistant tool so you can test out your
90:03 - vision for a show before you
90:07 - so
90:08 - we've got a couple sliders on the screen
90:10 - so you can change
90:11 - let's say we want to make it a little
90:12 - more blue so you can change the
90:15 - amount of red here and it gets a little
90:16 - more purple
90:21 - and then we can move this light back and
90:22 - forth and change the shadows
90:24 - on the screen here
90:27 - yeah so you can move the shadows back
90:29 - and forth and uh the idea is that you'll
90:31 - be able to move
90:32 - both lights
90:36 - do you have a background as a lighting
90:38 - designer yeah i did some uh stage
90:39 - lighting design in college uh i studied
90:42 - electrical engineering but always loved
90:43 - theater so i always wish there was a way
90:45 - to test out what i was wanting to put on
90:48 - the stage before i got there so we're
90:49 - we're no longer at 721 broadway yeah
90:51 - yeah but we should definitely reach out
90:53 - and see if anybody in the design
90:54 - department therapy i definitely will
90:57 - yeah yeah
90:58 - great job thank you so much
91:09 - hi mom my dad
91:17 - okay tell us your name in a couple
91:18 - sentences about your project oh okay so
91:20 - my name is tiani um i also go by that
91:24 - my project is about using your face to
91:26 - play a video game um this game is called
91:29 - fake your smile and basically it's a
91:31 - game that forces you to smile in order
91:34 - to play the game um and then like would
91:37 - you like to try sure yeah okay so um
91:40 - it's um
91:42 - so you just use this camera to like um
91:44 - it will recognize your face and in order
91:46 - to start the game you have to do this
91:49 - gesture okay which is pop
91:52 - might be a little hard with the theme
92:04 - okay so um yeah so basically um this is
92:08 - how you play this game by doing this
92:12 - yeah and once the game starts every time
92:15 - i smile
92:17 - it will show the friendliness to the
92:18 - people who pass by
92:20 - and it takes four friendliness to
92:23 - actually make someone like you like
92:27 - oh no i missed it um but basically you
92:30 - have to and smile like which is not
92:32 - smile to
92:34 - regain the positive energy um so if i do
92:37 - this person like
92:42 - this person will become my friend now so
92:44 - that's basically how i play this game um
92:46 - and then just
92:48 - it requires the player to continue smile
92:50 - or not smile in order to play this game
92:52 - and then there's a final challenge based
92:54 - on how much smile you have
92:56 - um if you made one person like you you
92:59 - have to spoke your smile for 10 seconds
93:01 - and if you made two people like to have
93:03 - to smile for 20 seconds so basically the
93:06 - better you do at the beginning the
93:07 - harder it is to win the game at the end
93:09 - and now my challenge
93:11 - if
93:12 - i have to keep my smile otherwise the
93:15 - circle will start shaking
93:17 - and then in that case i will lose the
93:18 - game
93:22 - yay so that's basically how i win the
93:24 - game um and
93:26 - um basically um the longest for this
93:29 - game on that you have to hold your smile
93:32 - is 30 seconds
93:34 - yeah
93:36 - [Music]
93:46 - um tell us your
93:47 - introduce yourself tell us your name in
93:49 - a few sentences about your project okay
93:51 - so my name is
93:53 - look here okay
93:56 - my name is anna oh and i'm second year
93:58 - of itp and then recently i am studying a
94:01 - little bit more about the ar interfaces
94:04 - so this is one of my projects
94:07 - i'm a really love to drink wine but when
94:10 - i go to my store i'm not a wine expert
94:12 - so i'm easily lost which one i have to
94:15 - buy so me and my friends
94:18 - built this ar app which helps you your
94:21 - wine selection
94:23 - so first of all you can choose your
94:25 - pre-line preference first for example
94:28 - for me i like medium
94:31 - and i like
94:32 - vanilla and i like a little bit spicy
94:36 - taste
94:37 - and then you can scan your wine level
94:48 - yeah okay
94:51 - if you want to position later yeah
94:54 - maybe here
94:58 - okay so this mean is zero match with my
95:01 - preference
95:03 - so this is just okay
95:05 - for me this y model
95:07 - so what about this one
95:11 - this one also
95:13 - zero match with my preference so i might
95:16 - don't want to buy these two bottles so
95:18 - if
95:19 - people can find it's a happy face that
95:22 - means that wine bottle is perfectly
95:24 - matched with people's preference so yeah
95:28 - we are still developing in this area
95:47 - can you can you uh tell us your name my
95:49 - name is pablo and i made this joy
95:52 - detection mirror and it basically uses
95:55 - computer vision and ai to know what a
95:57 - smile looks like and it sees as well it
96:00 - lights up and you go through the
96:02 - infinity mirror all the way to the
96:04 - vortex so you guys want to try it
96:06 - if you get it to smile
96:08 - and light up you have the right to take
96:10 - one mnm if it doesn't light up it means
96:12 - that you don't have a soul
96:14 - so you might check that with your doctor
96:16 - um hey lit up
96:21 - i know you're smiling he's picking it
96:25 - [Music]
96:43 - thank you great job thanks guys
96:46 - do you have a placard
97:02 - oh hi i'm emily
97:04 - hey i'm billy and uh we worked on a web
97:07 - and mobile app that tries to show the
97:09 - relation between sound and color since
97:10 - they're both using frequency and the
97:12 - unit of hertz and other couple different
97:14 - pages that we can walk you through but
97:17 - then um here's a learn page
97:21 - um so the sound isn't working on this
97:24 - but what it's doing is um these are the
97:26 - color frequencies and it's showing the
97:28 - wavelengths associated with it and
97:30 - ideally it plays the pitch so on here
97:32 - you can see
97:34 - how the blue is higher than the red
97:40 - people can go to this site right now yes
97:42 - um it is
97:44 - el315
97:46 - dot itp
97:48 - [Laughter]
97:57 - maybe wait a couple hours everybody
97:59 - there you go
98:00 - you can also send some signals so
98:02 - um people can collaboratively draw and
98:05 - once again it's supposed to play the
98:06 - associated page
98:08 - but people can just like make a little
98:09 - party page beautiful with colors super
98:11 - fun and then um billy here will
98:13 - demonstrate that yeah so this is reading
98:16 - the webcam we put it on the about page
98:19 - this is uh reading the webcam values
98:21 - across
98:22 - the pixelated image
98:24 - and
98:26 - it plays different midi values based on
98:28 - those uh based on the
98:31 - the pixel data basically so we're kind
98:33 - of mapping the
98:35 - colors to different musical notes here
98:49 - [Music]
98:54 - yeah thanks
99:06 - and i go by henry i'm a
99:08 - itb first year student and this is a
99:10 - project me and rebecca
99:12 - working on for
99:13 - pecan class and it's about how
99:16 - data can process through light and it's
99:20 - about how our daily action can be
99:23 - transferred and processed through like
99:26 - stage by stage so if users press a
99:28 - button about their activities and you
99:31 - see the visualization between like stage
99:34 - by stage like for example i'm pressing
99:36 - button about how facebook can using our
99:39 - data set from like collecting to
99:42 - exchange and to sell to other
99:44 - advertisement companies and how they

103:21 - fabrications
103:24 - oh yes i want my receipts yeah
103:26 - sorry it's a lot of information
103:29 - so
103:29 - it'd be time to pray

103:34 - thank you
103:40 - hey how are you i'm good okay tell us
103:43 - your name and a couple cents okay your
103:44 - project i'm zeyel i'm a first year of
103:47 - itp this is called thirsty plant
103:50 - so thirsty fun is a millennial digital
103:53 - pond that's only been watered by my
103:55 - social media account activities
103:57 - um so the way that
103:59 - it targets the issue of like how
104:00 - teenagers always stick for likes and
104:02 - followers on the internet and this
104:04 - outlines
104:05 - this point always needs water so i can
104:07 - demonstrate it so if someone liked my
104:10 - tweet
104:12 - it goes
104:13 - the waters start changing
104:16 - and
104:17 - yeah
104:18 - it's also the collective flight
104:20 - installation that i want to
104:22 - show people how like
104:24 - this water got like
104:26 - changed or light got changed based on
104:28 - time based on different people on the
104:30 - internet everyone can contribute to this
104:32 - light source eric kind of like do this
104:34 - yeah wonderful great job thank you
104:45 - what did you guys
104:50 - all right some of you might by the way
104:52 - recognize this is psy if you're a member
104:54 - of the coding train who's coding trade
104:55 - community
104:56 - so i'll just introduce yourself and tell
104:59 - us a few seconds about your project yeah
105:01 - so hi i'm sai i'm the coding trained
105:03 - community manager also first year at itp
105:06 - so this project is called the black
105:08 - projections project and basically i
105:11 - built what i call like a portal mapping
105:13 - device
105:14 - so it's like a map that potentially
105:16 - could help you unlock a portal and it
105:18 - kind of talks about or investigates
105:20 - space
105:21 - time and how those are all connected to
105:23 - a lot of different moments that are
105:24 - happening um and you basically explore
105:27 - it with the magnet you move across the
105:29 - points and then different images are
105:32 - projected on the screen
105:34 - how are you sensing the magnet i'm using
105:36 - read switches so
105:38 - each point each little circle has like a
105:40 - sensor underneath and basically when you
105:43 - place a magnet over it that turns on or
105:45 - off
105:45 - and then each kind of point has a
105:48 - collection of images that are then
105:49 - displayed randomly on the screen
105:53 - do you want to demonstrate
105:56 - [Music]
106:04 - [Music]
106:19 - i'm
106:21 - [Music]
106:38 - [Music]
106:53 - [Music]
106:57 - thank you
107:11 - okay
107:11 - tell us your name and a few sentences
107:13 - about your project hi my name is lenny
107:16 - and my name is by michelle
107:18 - so our project is called the pale blue
107:20 - dot and inspired by a article called
107:25 - yet articles called the pale blue dot by
107:27 - carl
107:28 - uh
107:29 - so basically uh the way he described the
107:32 - earth as they published uh saying the
107:34 - earth from the different perspective
107:36 - and uh i think that article is really
107:39 - inspiring um you never think earth as
107:42 - such a small and fragile
107:44 - thing that's tangible and because it's
107:47 - under our feet that we don't really
107:48 - recognize it
107:49 - so we made a tangible
107:52 - earth like with a really
107:55 - [Music]
107:57 - with a metaphor of the heartbeat by
107:59 - using the led dimming on and off
108:03 - to address the issue of actually our
108:05 - human action even though it seems to be
108:08 - really tiny but it's doing a lot to the
108:10 - earth and so on top of the earth there's
108:13 - some lollipop and when you take away the
108:16 - lollipop the earth will start to
108:19 - actually develop so it's actually
108:21 - showing that the heartbeat
108:24 - actually is
108:25 - being as not as lively as before and
108:29 - inside the wrap of the lollipop there's
108:32 - a message telling you that it's the
108:34 - representing the natural resource of
108:36 - lollipop and um
108:39 - but
108:40 - it's actually telling you that you can
108:41 - take away the lollipop like you don't
108:43 - have to feel guilty because we need to
108:45 - use the natural resources but it will be
108:47 - great if you can contribute a little
108:49 - back to the earth so we have like a
108:51 - hidden mission in this rack that you
108:53 - have to actually squat down to find the
108:56 - white box under the table and inside the
108:59 - box there is more lollipop that you can
109:02 - decide to plant one lollipop back to the
109:05 - blue dot
109:07 - so if you plan it back
109:09 - yeah it will become lively again
109:14 - thank you so much
109:29 - okay tell us your name and a few
109:31 - sentences about your projects okay i'm
109:33 - starting tomorrow
109:34 - second year
109:36 - and i have um
109:39 - like installation
109:53 - but it can be also simulated by a very
109:55 - simple method it's like like i said
109:57 - ultimate oil so it costs you that
109:59 - speaking space
110:01 - okay so big wave goes faster quite a
110:04 - small wave goes slower
110:06 - so it's very similar to the real world
110:20 - is
110:34 - and also i have some air to
110:49 - originally from there
110:51 - and also here
110:54 - [Music]
111:01 - but people knew that
111:03 - scary so
111:05 - run away until 99.8 percent people
111:08 - survive but even
111:10 - [Music]
111:12 - yeah but here also i have some another
111:15 - thing
111:16 - yeah i i just quickly assure you
111:20 - [Music]
111:28 - [Music]
111:41 - [Music]
111:53 - can we come check out your project okay
111:55 - tell us your names and a few sentences
111:57 - about what you made
111:59 - the name of our project is wink rocks
112:01 - and women and it's about penio
112:03 - who are basically deep su divers in jojo
112:05 - island but it also includes stories from
112:08 - mothers in mainland korea
112:10 - so you can listen to different stories
112:12 - through different objects by scanning
112:14 - the
112:15 - tag over here to the side of your
112:17 - headphones
112:21 - and what were your names
112:23 - my name is sue
112:24 - i'm katy
112:28 - sure
112:35 - oh no i don't want to put anything on
112:36 - there
112:45 - just
113:01 - can you talk a little bit about what
113:02 - he's hearing
113:04 - yes so these are just various stories
113:07 - from interviews um taken
113:09 - from kenyo in jeju island so it's just
113:12 - kind of about like the henyo have like a
113:14 - very eco-friendly approach
113:17 - to deep sea diving and collecting
113:18 - shellfish they make sure that they never
113:20 - over harvest and they have just like a
113:22 - collective community
113:24 - of like making sure that yeah they never
113:26 - over harvest and they collect trash but
113:28 - um sadly this probably is the last
113:30 - generation of this profession just
113:32 - because like younger women in jeju
113:34 - island are choosing not to like pursue
113:36 - this profession which requires just
113:38 - years and years of training so we just
113:40 - kind of want to give an homage to like
113:43 - the different culture that has kind of
113:44 - developed in jojo island where it's more
113:46 - like matriarchal than
113:48 - mainland korea um
113:50 - yeah that's kind of funny
113:52 - yeah we also wanted to kind of
113:54 - uh
113:56 - tell the story of kenya side by side
113:58 - with
114:00 - the story of a mother in seoul so more
114:02 - of the traditional patriarchal society
114:06 - and living in that society
114:08 - thank you thanks
114:11 - i'm good
114:13 - yeah stronger than i realized all right
114:15 - let's see oh boy we've been going for
114:16 - two hours now yeah
114:27 - [Music]
114:29 - yeah i don't know if we're gonna be able

114:34 - for the takes okay tell us your names
114:36 - and a few sentences about your project
114:37 - my name is alvaro couture
114:40 - i'm nicole gernelling
114:41 - and our project is a object tracking
114:45 - installation that tracks objects to
114:47 - control different types of animations in
114:49 - real time
114:51 - so we have these spheres
114:53 - that
114:54 - help with all of the animations
114:56 - and
114:57 - yeah that's development
114:59 - after using the connect here to track
115:03 - the size of the spheres and the light
115:06 - the brightness of the spheres
115:08 - so we're getting a really smooth
115:09 - tracking of these
115:11 - which are being sent to the 3d particle
115:13 - system in unity
115:15 - and we're getting these real-time
115:24 - [Music]
115:30 - and they're both working today they are
115:32 - yeah
115:33 - they are
115:36 - all right
115:37 - it's time to take a nap okay
115:40 - uh tell us your name and if you sent us
115:42 - about your project hi i'm brent uh and i
115:45 - think work is for suckers um so i made
115:47 - this game about not working it's called
115:49 - stay in bed simulator the goal is to
115:50 - stay in the bed for as long as possible
115:52 - the game is controlled by the bed
116:08 - so you can watch tv in your bed
116:14 - you can also look at your phone in your
116:15 - bed
116:18 - and yeah
116:19 - that's pretty much that's pretty much
116:20 - the whole thing
116:29 - and what's the rule what's the record um
116:31 - the record i think right now is about 20
116:34 - 000 points which is roughly 15 minutes
116:36 - set by your very own alden rivendale
116:37 - jones um
116:39 - i have a feeling i could do very well

116:58 - uh tell us your name and a few sentences
117:00 - about your project okay i'm david and
117:03 - this is uh my project is about
117:05 - reflecting the website environments as a
117:08 - physical environment to create a tree
117:10 - that based on the website environment
117:12 - and makes it
117:13 - yeah and then
117:15 - generate the image that represent the
117:17 - environment that the user know that
117:20 - the website they go into are exactly
117:22 - like the physical environment affect you
117:25 - mentally and physically so yeah by
117:27 - showing a tree so
117:29 - here's the
117:31 - here's the website so you can go to on
117:33 - any website but for now we have a frozen
117:35 - tomatoes last airbender reviews and
117:38 - as you can see it's quite negative and
117:41 - it's a there's a red leaves and
117:44 - yeah and the entire background is in is
117:47 - like lightning and stuff so it's quite
117:50 - sad to see but it just shows you that
117:54 - you're going into a
117:56 - scary website right now at least a scary
117:58 - comments but yeah and if you look at the
118:02 - for example like
118:04 - articles from like box and stuff it take
118:07 - a while to load but yeah it will it'll
118:10 - create a tree based on the article it
118:12 - views it's getting the analysis and oh
118:15 - yeah so the
118:16 - the websites have a positive like a
118:20 - positive
118:22 - and the negative it's very more positive
118:24 - and it creates a field
118:26 - and it has a tree that represents all
118:28 - the
118:30 - all the words that go into the website
118:39 - [Music]
118:46 - all right tell us your name and a few
118:48 - words about your project okay uh my name
118:50 - is julia fernandez i worked on this with
118:51 - isabel rican she's in california um and
118:55 - my project is supposed to talk about the
118:57 - absurdity of our faces and how strange
118:59 - we look when our face is dissected and
119:02 - how recognizable we are
119:04 - awesome should i try it yes you should
119:06 - tried it yesterday this one is fun
119:16 - oh it has trouble with glasses and
119:18 - sometimes discriminates on a beard sorry
119:23 - but there you are
119:32 - what's funny is when i take my glasses
119:34 - off i can't see
119:36 - oh i don't actually know
119:42 - awesome
119:53 - okay can you tell us your name and a few
119:55 - sentences about it yeah i'm shinjuku and
119:58 - my partner is alvin he's not here he's
120:00 - flying on the miami beach
120:03 - must be nice yeah this is my project
120:05 - it's called evan flow
120:07 - and it is a kinetic light sculpture and
120:13 - we're doing this it's like light is
120:15 - always perceived as a static element in
120:17 - our life so we want to kind of break the
120:21 - boundaries and explore light in the more
120:24 - vivid way so
120:27 - we're using this to
120:31 - this motion kind of using this motion
120:34 - to recreate the tangible and natural
120:38 - phenomenon of app and flow
120:40 - so this is like going up and down and
120:44 - material wise we use mineral oil and
120:49 - this is hanging spotlights so it's kind
120:51 - of recreate the effects of sunlight hits
120:58 - if you
120:59 - see it from the side you may see the
121:01 - wavy motion
121:17 - hi tell us your name and a couple words
121:19 - about your project sure my name is aydah
121:21 - and this is my project
121:23 - it's noise it's an audio enhanced
121:26 - optical illusion
121:27 - the
121:28 - the visual pattern is a vortex the
121:30 - center shifts depending on where you're
121:32 - looking at it so as the viewer moves
121:35 - around in space it triggers also
121:37 - triggers the audio changes in the
121:39 - headphone that corresponds to the
121:42 - direction of the moving center of the
121:44 - vortex
121:47 - cool
121:48 - thank
121:48 - you do you want to try it
122:05 - oh this is the music one
122:42 - is
122:54 - just tell us your name and a few
122:56 - sentences about your project okay hi my
122:58 - name
122:59 - and this is my project here it's called
123:00 - auto vendor it's a vending machine and
123:03 - it's crew project with davey and lachlan
123:05 - so it is
123:07 - built
123:08 - like a fake vending machine we were
123:10 - trying to do here is to sell animations
123:12 - so the slogan for this is snacks and
123:14 - work so we thought about like on this
123:16 - floor
123:18 - aside from the snacks what else the
123:19 - students need when they're frustrated or
123:21 - hungry so do you want to give it a try
123:23 - sure
123:35 - is
123:40 - [Applause]
123:45 - so these are shot using slow motion
123:48 - screen and this is actually one of the
123:50 - earliest if you want to see
123:53 - [Music]
124:00 - recording the screen right now
124:02 - i'm sorry
124:23 - so this is actually
124:24 - like uh recorded using a stop motion and
124:27 - what we're trying to do here is some of
124:29 - the animations are like the machine eat
124:31 - the food itself so we were trying to go
124:33 - to think about the concept of
124:35 - convenience right now and try to link
124:36 - there was laziness it's like right now
124:39 - like the machine instead of it gives you
124:40 - food it eats itself but then we show
124:42 - this to everybody and they think that
124:44 - like the asmr like sound are very joyful
124:47 - and the teacher suggests that or you you
124:49 - guys should probably make just a cute
124:51 - machine as those animations and we're
124:53 - trying to make puns on that so that it
124:55 - gives you encouragement when you see the
124:56 - message that was going to say um go
124:59 - through the barricade and there are also
125:00 - some some others like i love you very
125:03 - much
125:04 - things like that so it's kind of cute

128:58 - if it works a little bit better
128:59 - everybody's a little bit out of frame
129:02 - honestly
129:17 - image
129:18 - [Music]
129:31 - good shave
129:33 - good job
129:44 - you got to watch
129:48 - all right tell us your name and a couple
129:50 - of sentences about your project uh my
129:52 - name is wenjing um my project is called
129:54 - neither square or circle it's all saying
129:57 - in chinese is saying that you cannot
129:59 - like make a circle without using ruler
130:02 - so it means you cannot
130:04 - um achieve something if you don't follow
130:06 - some rules so i want to explore that
130:09 - definition and
130:10 - the space between definition and
130:12 - ambiguity so i try to translate that
130:15 - into sound and
130:16 - visual
130:18 - so i want to translate between square
130:20 - and a circle and the
130:23 - visual of e will translate it into the
130:26 - sound wave
130:27 - so from a square wave to a circle
130:31 - more like a sine wave thing
130:34 - [Music]
130:38 - yeah so that's the basic idea
130:41 - behind this
130:48 - [Music]
130:56 - it's beautiful and you're just
130:57 - projecting uh like a rectangle moving
130:59 - back and forth by projecting a line a
131:01 - line the shape is defined by the all of
131:04 - these yeah
131:07 - [Music]
131:22 - okay we
131:36 - okay yeah so all right tell us your name
131:38 - and a few cents about the project i'm
131:40 - skylar devos this is my project i called
131:42 - it liquid relationships
131:44 - um and it's about connecting with other
131:46 - people
131:47 - yeah like how what's the best way for us
131:49 - to demonstrate this student is to
131:51 - okay and do it okay who wants to try all
131:54 - right i was here yesterday with like six
131:57 - people doing it it was crazy yeah the
131:58 - more people you have
132:00 - the more fun it is
132:02 - i i should not participate because i
132:04 - shouldn't tell you
132:11 - okay
132:22 - [Music]
132:31 - are the
132:32 - things that are aquarium pumps
132:35 - this is a fish tank i had as a kid
132:37 - really yeah
132:39 - that is wild it's beautiful does it
132:41 - matter just like a little like
132:45 - [Music]
133:04 - [Music]
133:07 - so it works with at least 10 people i
133:08 - haven't found
133:11 - that's amazing
133:13 - [Applause]
133:18 - it's very hard to show the vr project so
133:32 - all right i'm excited to see this in
133:33 - action all right tell us your names and
133:34 - just couple sentences about the project
133:36 - hi my name is ty hi my name is ashwin
133:38 - and this is our project it's a two-way
133:41 - shadow wall where you see the shadow of
133:43 - yourself as well as the shadow of the
133:44 - person behind it and when your two
133:46 - shadows overlap it creates music
133:48 - and we have created different sections
133:50 - which adds different filters into the
133:53 - sound piece so you can make play around
133:55 - the entire space and yeah just have fun
133:57 - with it
133:58 - so it's a different way of communicating
134:00 - with each other
134:01 - do you guys want to try it yeah sure
134:03 - sure
134:04 - yeah why don't you two try and i'll fail
134:06 - it's gonna hold
134:07 - do you want me to hold it
134:09 - [Music]
134:11 - if you say anything about the project
134:13 - say it into there the channel this one's
134:15 - live
134:17 - i tried your reactions
134:21 - [Music]
134:26 - [Music]
134:32 - [Music]
134:34 - there's no projections
134:50 - all right
134:51 - here we go
134:53 - only about like four and a half hours in
134:55 - all right
134:56 - no no no no but it's been two hours
134:59 - all right tell us your names and a few
135:02 - sentences about your project
135:03 - hi i'm tina i'm chris christina and this
135:07 - project is called one amongst many it's
135:09 - a physical data visualization
135:11 - representing women in computing
135:15 - fantastic yeah all right so what should
135:17 - we try you want to walk around through
135:19 - it and yeah
135:22 - as
135:23 - you uh pick up these orbs they
135:24 - illuminate to full brightness and you
135:26 - can see
135:27 - every woman that we
135:30 - chose is
135:31 - a cohort with a bunch of other women so
135:33 - we have computer scientists
135:34 - mathematicians as you pick
135:37 - an orb up and read about a certain woman
135:39 - other women in her cohort will also
135:41 - eliminate
135:43 - and as the orbs are interacted with over
135:45 - time they get incrementally brighter so
135:48 - the orbs that have been read a lot will
135:50 - sort of like increase invisibility and
135:53 - you can also see other orbs that have
135:55 - been read a little bit less
135:57 - yeah their
135:59 - placements are based chronologically on
136:01 - their years of accomplishments and
136:03 - their heights are based on their numbers
136:05 - of backlinks which identifies how famous
136:07 - they are so the least famous ones are
136:09 - lower to give the audience more
136:10 - accessibility to the information
136:13 - and yeah our whole concept is to kind of
136:16 - like uh give more visibility to these
136:19 - women and inspire young people to get
136:22 - into the field of computing because us
136:24 - as creators we felt like we didn't
136:26 - really know we still didn't know about
136:27 - these women until we did this project so
136:29 - it was a shame but it was really awesome
136:32 - and yeah we want to inspire the young
136:33 - people here can you tell us really great
136:34 - things about the board over there yeah
136:36 - sure
136:41 - um
136:42 - so
136:43 - this is a sticker board and like our
136:44 - idea is to kind of like have a piece of
136:47 - the project where the audience can leave
136:50 - a mark of their own into
136:52 - our project
136:54 - these are the four categories that are
136:57 - represented within our project and we
136:58 - want people who have seen the project to
137:00 - identify themselves within one of these
137:02 - circles whether they're computer
137:04 - scientists mathematician um
137:07 - creative or executives activists
137:09 - inventors or you know like a merge of
137:11 - different circles so yeah it's a little
137:13 - fun fun thing for them to leave behind
137:16 - thank you good job thank you
137:22 - [Music]
137:30 - uh just introduce yourself and tell us a
137:32 - couple things about your night uh i'm
137:34 - gail i'm a first year at itp
137:37 - and this is gil spurling by the way uh
137:40 - this is the interactive scroll
137:43 - um so
137:45 - it's designed to allow someone to
137:46 - interact with an ancient scroll
137:50 - physically so you can
137:53 - use these rods to scroll through
137:57 - they have a bunch of different
137:59 - ancient texts here which are in hebrew
138:04 - and then this allows you to
138:07 - translate
138:09 - as you're
138:10 - reading it if you can't
138:13 - read the hebrew language or
138:16 - um
138:18 - the text isn't legible
138:20 - this is
138:22 - what allows you to read
138:24 - you can scroll a little further
138:32 - [Music]
138:40 - so yeah this was a
138:42 - uh p-comp um
138:44 - project
138:45 - um
138:47 - sort of like a basic interaction design
138:50 - um
138:52 - it would probably work well and uh
138:55 - should i keep going no we're good thank
138:56 - you
139:00 - yeah
139:02 - wow
139:04 - this is yours right yeah yeah give us uh
139:06 - tell us tell us your name and a few
139:08 - sentences about your project hi i'm nick
139:10 - um this is a project with sid chow i'm
139:12 - nick greg
139:13 - um this these are uh
139:15 - it's called conversation which is a duet
139:18 - between two hanging lamps each of these
139:20 - lamps emit light when bitten so the idea
139:23 - here is that in a dark room where this
139:25 - would be the only source of light
139:26 - that this would sort of be tools for
139:28 - listening so that to keep a room
139:31 - lit while also having a conversation you
139:33 - would switch off between talking and
139:35 - otherwise biting or producing the light
139:38 - and so as you look also looking at the
139:39 - sort of mouth as the main switch point
139:41 - for the interaction
139:45 - now are you demonstrating this or uh
139:56 - here so that your your teeth don't go
139:58 - fully out but
140:04 - so yeah the other one's short shorted
140:07 - right now but you could imagine this
140:09 - being a popular tool for
140:10 - dark room in paris cool
140:20 - just tell us your name in a couple
140:22 - sentences about your project um we'll
140:23 - take a look at it yeah absolutely i'm
140:25 - julian matthews this is the hourglass
140:28 - um so there is climate change related
140:31 - data um correlated to um the visual on
140:34 - the sculpture
140:35 - do you want to do the honors or should i
140:37 - do it myself i think okay yeah you got
140:39 - your hands busy gotcha um so this is a
140:42 - statistic related to bees um if the bee
140:45 - disappeared off the face of the earth
140:46 - humans would only have four years left
140:47 - to live
140:48 - um there are some static ones
140:50 - another static one and then these
140:52 - require some user input this is meant to
140:54 - visualize rising sea levels so you can
140:57 - use a slider
140:58 - to
141:00 - demonstrate that
141:02 - this is the approximate hue of the flint
141:04 - river water during peak crisis a little
141:06 - bit terrifying that this was coming out
141:08 - of people's faucets
141:10 - this checks the air quality of any city
141:11 - in the world so wouldn't you want to
141:13 - give me a city
141:15 - this is this is showing paris right now
141:16 - it's moderate brooklyn new york let's
141:18 - put in brooklyn baby
141:22 - we're good
141:24 - but then you could also put in like
141:26 - shanghai for example
141:28 - and you get a not so good value in
141:30 - return um
141:33 - yeah it's been a little bit terrifying
141:35 - seeing people like laugh at that all day
141:36 - because it's actually terrifying but um
141:40 - yeah and then a couple more statistic
141:41 - related
141:42 - visuals and um
141:45 - that's about it awesome can you speak a
141:47 - little bit i might not be clear to
141:48 - people watching live can you speak to
141:50 - what is what this is exactly is not
141:53 - actually three-dimensional for sure
141:55 - display um here let me slide around here
141:57 - sorry
141:58 - um so these are two discs that i
142:00 - actually 3d printed
142:02 - um
142:03 - that once it slows down i attach
142:05 - neopixel strips on the outside and with
142:07 - this motor down here it allows me to
142:09 - spin it at 450 rotations per minute
142:13 - which gives the illusion of these two
142:15 - globes great job yeah thank you
142:17 - appreciate it
142:19 - all right i think maybe we're going
142:21 - around to the hallway yeah
142:47 - all right
142:59 - so this is our lenticular portal room
143:01 - okay oh can you can we both stand next
143:03 - to each other i'm sorry now i'm totally
143:04 - just interrupting no we don't want to
143:06 - kick everybody out oh we're the worst
143:09 - okay all right all right all right all
143:10 - right uh just tell us your names in a
143:11 - few seconds about the project uh so i'm
143:13 - aiden uh fowler i'm nicole kellequito
143:16 - and this is our lenticular portal room
143:17 - so we're doing experiments with a
143:19 - lenticular lens which is if you've seen
143:21 - bookmarks that have moving images that's
143:22 - what we're working with here and it
143:24 - stretches and magnifies the light so
143:25 - we're doing different experiments here
143:27 - we have a three-dimensional box
143:29 - um moving lenses that are rotating and
143:31 - then
143:32 - these flat sun rises over the ocean
143:35 - fantastic all right we'll try to get
143:36 - some footage for people to see all of
143:37 - them now
143:39 - and this one's a mirror so if
143:42 - it's reflecting the top and bottom
143:44 - um yeah cool
143:47 - and over here we're looking at like the
143:49 - bending of the lenticular lens um and
143:51 - also looking at the lens like when it's
143:54 - perpendicular to a light source
143:56 - um
143:57 - it's kind of creating an
143:59 - infinite uh color field if you look
144:02 - through it
144:03 - um
144:04 - and depending on how you're looking at
144:05 - it you can see the the light kind of
144:08 - creates these like pillars um and
144:11 - bending throughout the shape
144:16 - there's nothing there's nothing the best
144:18 - angle for the box there's nothing in the
144:19 - box shall we do the reveal of like what
144:22 - actually is inside it's an empty box
144:24 - it's an empty box wow the secret is
144:26 - revealed
144:28 - but there's a thousand leds in here
144:31 - did you guys
144:32 - do it
144:34 - oh no
144:35 - i thought they were individual and like
144:37 - yeah
144:52 - and this last piece over here is a
144:54 - separate um it's not lenticular this is
144:56 - called dichroic film um and based on the
144:58 - angle of incidence the angle the light's
145:00 - hitting the material a different
145:01 - wavelength of light passes through or is
145:03 - reflected and you can change the speed
145:05 - with this little knob down here so you
145:07 - can turn it from almost a video
145:09 - and then kind of stop motion
145:11 - you just do that again it'll get up
145:23 - super closer yeah amazing great job
145:26 - thanks for coming by all right
146:05 - available okay great um can you both
146:07 - just introduce yourself briefly and tell
146:09 - us a few sentences about your prize oh
146:11 - yeah hi i'm wen i'm from taiwan hi i'm
146:14 - kj i'm from korea yeah so this project
146:17 - is called goddamn voices so this is
146:19 - basically a garden system that is based
146:21 - on word recognition
146:23 - so you can choose the word from the
146:24 - library build and save it to a
146:26 - microphone and see how it goes
146:31 - so
146:33 - i'm obviously going to pick
146:35 - rainbow
146:37 - yeah you can't say it again
146:40 - rainbow
146:46 - so the rainbow or town that water and
146:48 - the water water pump and the light i
146:50 - know the the cheat code
146:53 - revolution
146:58 - revolution
147:06 - so you're trying everything because
147:07 - revolution is the most powerful word
147:10 - for us
147:11 - yeah so this installation is about like
147:14 - the power of words because sometimes
147:15 - it's too
147:17 - it's not as invisible so people just
147:19 - ignore it and want to enforce emphasize
147:22 - that this is so strong that people
147:24 - should pay responsible for it and you
147:26 - should be aware of it
147:28 - great job thank you thank you
147:34 - thank you
147:36 - can you tell us about the project yeah
147:38 - okay yeah
147:39 - because then we can if then we can go
147:41 - inside and the idea of this project is
147:43 - to
147:45 - let people to interact what they are
147:47 - doing in a routine life and um
147:50 - let them be aware of what they're doing
147:52 - because normally sometimes people are
147:55 - like doing their things on wealthy so
147:58 - it's the original idea of this project
148:01 - and
148:02 - yeah so we made a box which can reflect
148:05 - what people are doing in their daily
148:07 - life so we said some of the interactions
148:10 - in the real side room and every
148:12 - connection they're doing their room will
148:14 - be reflected in a small box and just
148:16 - just so we get it can you say your name
148:17 - in the name of the product yeah my name
148:19 - is
148:20 - and here
148:22 - is
148:24 - the creator of this project yeah just
148:26 - say your name so i'll find you funny
148:28 - pineapple yes
148:30 - you can go in but it's one person at a
148:33 - time
148:34 - well do you want to just take the camera
148:36 - in sure
148:40 - okay
149:04 - so you can sit down
149:20 - i yes
149:29 - [Music]
149:38 - so
149:41 - [Music]
149:48 - [Music]
149:54 - okay
149:57 - [Music]
150:12 - laughs
150:18 - time
150:37 - the chair's moving
150:46 - let's deal down
151:01 - that's beautiful
151:03 - very cool
151:06 - thanks
151:15 - sarah pop in there if you want to leave
151:16 - your shoes on you can just sit on the
151:18 - material and hang your feet
151:20 - hey hey can you guys introduce
151:22 - yourselves and tell us a few cents about
151:23 - the project oh yeah
151:25 - yeah get in there
151:27 - uh my name is gilad gillard
151:30 - um the project is called fever dream
151:34 - it is
151:35 - i'm gonna read off the thing a
151:38 - uh
151:39 - experimental light
151:41 - therapy to induce the participant into a
151:42 - fever dream and into another person's
151:44 - memories so it's based off of a personal
151:46 - experience that i had with a fever dream
151:48 - and
151:49 - uh built into an experience where people
151:51 - can
151:52 - try to
151:53 - be in that fever dream
151:55 - yeah
151:56 - built it with nick gregg
151:58 - uh
151:59 - partner in crime uh
152:02 - it's based off of a project that i did
152:04 - in
152:05 - uh
152:06 - called performing reality the class and
152:09 - that's taught by andrew schneider and
152:11 - yeah the best class i took at itp
152:14 - it's just about to start now if you guys
152:15 - wanna go in there yeah
152:18 - so we can kind of look from the side
152:24 - hey
152:50 - you
152:52 - you are
152:55 - asleep
153:12 - so
153:28 - you are
153:30 - in your body
153:32 - in another
153:45 - it's really intense
154:02 - [Music]
154:14 - you
154:19 - are
154:21 - yourself
154:31 - don't
154:42 - you move ready
155:21 - hello
155:22 - oh yes
155:28 - we're almost done
155:46 - come on in this is my project partner uh
155:49 - okay so stand next to me okay so
155:51 - standing next to each other
155:52 - so hey guys how's it going my name is
155:55 - sun liu and my name is chiang kao zhang
155:58 - and we are
156:00 - uh echo of silence as you can see here
156:03 - um
156:05 - our
156:06 - it's working right now so um as you
156:09 - could see earlier when we had the door
156:11 - open uh we left the noise streaming in
156:13 - uh the sculpture stopped all activities
156:16 - um and now we're gonna try and be quiet
156:18 - for a moment and see if something
156:20 - happens
156:28 - and if i keep making noise again and
156:30 - making conversation with you guys it's
156:32 - not supposed to be doing anything and if
156:34 - i keep quiet again
156:42 - beautiful yeah the inspiration
156:45 - basically comes from our own background
156:47 - as technology students we constantly
156:49 - make moving and talking machines
156:52 - and so this time
156:54 - for the winter show we were thinking
156:56 - what if we're making a project that
156:57 - would discourage all activities all the
157:00 - talking all the noisy
157:03 - digital distractions out there and just
157:05 - take a moment to connect
157:07 - more
157:08 - and listening you know closely more to
157:11 - ourselves to the people around us to our
157:13 - environment
157:15 - how would that sound like and how would
157:17 - that feel like
157:19 - thank you so much thank you for stopping
157:20 - by okay
157:24 - okay
157:28 - thank you thanks
157:35 - okay okay
157:36 - uh tell us your name in a few senses
157:38 - about your project yeah sure my name is
157:40 - na and my project's called confession
157:42 - room uh the purpose of is to show
157:45 - solidarity with sexual assault victims
157:47 - in china who were censored during the
157:49 - meeting movement last year
157:53 - so um what is the process of interacting
157:55 - with the project would you like to try
157:58 - i need
158:04 - actually i can yeah i can just play the
158:06 - audio a lot i think it should be fine
158:08 - but i probably could do some coding
158:11 - do mine
158:14 - um i think we just get like some shots
158:17 - of the project
158:18 - um and is there a place where people can
158:20 - find out more about your work online
158:21 - yeah sure
158:25 - so like basically you will hear some
158:27 - background uh story so when you after
158:30 - you sit down you'll hear some background
158:31 - stories of the movement
158:34 - and then it will ask you to read this
158:37 - passage which is the english translation
158:40 - of a real victim story i think this is
158:42 - unplugged
158:46 - i think it's i think it's supposed to be
158:48 - right and then you were reading to you
158:50 - just need to repeat that message and
158:52 - reading that into the microphone
158:56 - and
158:57 - if you get the words right the lies will
158:59 - show up and if you're they're saying
159:01 - they can't hear you're here
159:02 - and if you get the words wrong you will
159:05 - hear some really annoying uh
159:07 - high-pitched beeping okay yeah
159:11 - i'm not sure if it works without the
159:13 - earphones
159:24 - he said it's much better now yeah
159:26 - i had just put it away i forgot what was
159:29 - going on okay there you go this project
159:32 - reflects that you turn it up all the way
159:34 - to movement in china last year
159:37 - sexual cell victims in the country have
159:39 - found it difficult to build their voices
159:41 - out as they are going up against not
159:43 - just the male dominant culture but also
159:46 - the government censorship
159:48 - the following experience might cause
159:50 - emotional distress as the address is
159:53 - sexual violence
159:54 - if you believe that you will find
159:56 - experience to be traumatizing you can
159:58 - choose to not participate
160:01 - if you're willing to proceed read this
160:03 - paragraph out loud repeat the words if
160:06 - you get stuck until the words are
160:09 - highlighted
160:10 - after you're done share your thoughts
160:12 - with us
160:16 - afterwards he drove me home
160:18 - did you get closer
160:20 - afterwards
160:22 - he drove me home
160:24 - and asked
160:26 - me to sit in the front seat
160:28 - stroking my hand he said to me in the
160:31 - tone of an elder
160:33 - do not mention what happened today to
160:35 - anyone i was just testing your moral
160:37 - conduct i only take students who are not
160:40 - just smart but also well behaved you
160:43 - pass the test you must have high morals
160:46 - i was too scared to say anything you've
160:48 - come to the end of this project
160:51 - thank you for giving boys to these
160:52 - victims
160:54 - now take a moment to reflect on
160:56 - experience
160:57 - you can scan a qr code if you like more

163:31 - you can see your pulse be unreal
163:34 - time
163:45 - [Music]
163:46 - i'm glad that you have these freezer
163:48 - bags here it's good to keep that on ice

163:56 - elements uh
163:57 - yeah
164:01 - it's also speaking
164:02 - yes
164:04 - what is it made out of silicon

164:10 - great job thank you
164:13 - okay
164:16 - sort
164:26 - i feel like we're at the nexus of these
164:28 - projects
164:40 - this is from the class called art toy
164:42 - design
164:43 - here at itp
164:53 - okay
165:20 - okay tell us your names and a couple
165:22 - words about your project my name is
165:24 - [Music]
165:32 - this is our steampunk coffee machine and
165:34 - it's designed that people to basically
165:38 - get that perfect cup of coffee that you
165:40 - need for the day because sometimes you
165:41 - just don't know how much coffee you need
165:43 - and
165:44 - you answer a couple questions and it'll
165:45 - tell you exactly how many grams of
165:47 - coffee you might want that day and also
165:49 - the type of coffee
165:51 - and
165:51 - the machine basically gets water from
165:53 - here it goes up and the water comes out
165:56 - and you can also get the perfect
165:57 - measurement for your coffee
165:59 - abby would you like to add a few words
166:01 - yeah sure so if you go ahead and follow
166:03 - me to where little
166:05 - sliders are so you can answer the first
166:07 - question is like
166:08 - how
166:09 - how are you doing today so you got like
166:10 - three options from
166:12 - great to
166:13 - dead basically and it's a
166:16 - and then how strong you like your coffee
166:18 - so whether you want a subtle to a bold
166:21 - cup and then what kind of rose profile
166:23 - you prefer light medium or dark and we
166:25 - actually have three types of beans which
166:26 - are from brooklyn roasting company
166:28 - so
166:29 - based off of your response to some of
166:30 - those questions
166:32 - um
166:32 - or the three questions rather
166:35 - on the first led screen you would get a
166:37 - display of which type of coffee to use
166:39 - and how many grams and then you would
166:41 - weigh out the amount of coffee
166:43 - right on the scale
166:44 - so
166:45 - now we've basically put the coffee into
166:47 - this filter here and are doing moreover
166:49 - coverage
166:50 - for the coffee how many how many cups of
166:52 - coffee have you made do you think that's
166:53 - at least 20 i think
166:55 - yeah between the two days um
167:02 - i would buy i would much rather buy
167:03 - coffee from you on a daily
167:10 - all right
167:33 - can you oh us your name and a couple
167:34 - sentences about your project my name is

167:42 - this is basically a musical instrument
167:44 - that has eight different monophonic
167:46 - synthesizers and we also have a
167:49 - real-time recordable sequencer so we let
167:52 - me show you quickly can i show you okay
167:55 - currently yeah there are some
167:58 - recording clips so i'm gonna clear them
168:00 - you can clear them by double tapping
168:02 - the clips and how it works is basically
168:06 - you just turn on the metronome and then
168:08 - while holding down the clip you
168:12 - and then it will be recorded
168:25 - and then you can even record your
168:28 - knob movements in real time too
168:31 - [Music]
168:33 - and then each rows represent different
168:35 - patterns so you can
168:37 - [Music]
168:39 - record different patterns and then
168:41 - arrange them in real time so it's very
168:43 - suitable for live performance i would
168:45 - say
168:50 - thank you so much
169:13 - all right just so for a minute here

171:41 - have here is an eeg an eeg is an electro
171:44 - encephalogram it's got four electrodes
171:46 - built in here and what it's going to do
171:47 - is it's going to read the electrical
171:49 - activity inside of his brain and he's
171:50 - going to be able to manipulate a
171:52 - javascript animation with it patrick
171:54 - would you like to put this on your
171:55 - forehead i would love to awesome
171:57 - it's easy to go right behind
172:09 - so patrick right now the fireflies are

172:13 - the game sure let the fireflies go
172:15 - just pull it right off
172:17 - awesome we've got our fireflies on the
172:18 - screen when patrick concentrates the
172:20 - fireflies are going to come together
172:22 - patrick's not concentrated the fireflies
172:24 - are just going to be hanging out just
172:25 - like this so when we start the
172:26 - transmission of these brown waves so we
172:29 - have a prompt in the middle of the
172:30 - screen count to five um props are
172:32 - different for everyone so if you want to
172:34 - help focus you can look at that prompt
172:36 - or you can focus on something specific
172:38 - on the screen
172:41 - these are all different um you can use
172:42 - to help focus yeah
172:44 - one of the first people to say this is
172:46 - neither precise or accurate if it
172:47 - doesn't come together on your first try
172:49 - do not worry it's really just the device
172:52 - you do pretty well
172:53 - [Music]
173:04 - [Music]
173:06 - oh yeah and we've also got some excess
173:21 - [Music]

173:24 - over here
173:26 - all right now just tell us your name and
173:28 - finish yourself in a couple sentences
173:29 - about the project hi my name is trendy
173:31 - sauce and this is my project called calm
173:34 - it's an immersive mindfulness-based
173:36 - experience where a person is wearing an
173:38 - eeg headset that's wirelessly connected
173:40 - to my phone and then my computer
173:42 - so they're actually controlling the
173:44 - visualizations as well as the lights
173:46 - with their mind so if somebody is in an
173:48 - unfocused state you can see here the
173:50 - lights are flickering as well as the
173:51 - visualizations and when they're in a
173:53 - more focused piece of mind the lights
173:55 - turn blue as well as the screen so i'm
173:58 - really interested in wellness and tech
173:59 - and how we might use tech to help
174:01 - ourselves
174:02 - instead of using tech as a form of
174:03 - escapism i want to use tech to kind of
174:05 - get more in touch with yourself
174:07 - so i'm doing things like this i'm i've
174:09 - launched a company called design life
174:10 - well at designlifebull.com
174:12 - where you can experience things like
174:14 - this with other artists and free online
174:16 - workshops that use binaural sounds
174:18 - nature or sounds to kind of help you get
174:20 - more in touch with yourself and manifest
174:22 - your dreams so
174:23 - thank you so much thank you it must be
174:25 - hard to get that feeling in this show
174:29 - he's doing a great job

174:53 - femininity
174:55 - an immersive environment that's aimed
174:58 - to let you
174:59 - focus on the feminine sides of your
175:01 - brain which is the ability to birth
175:04 - spread the narration idea
175:07 - so there are a few ways to interact with
175:09 - it besides just to be immersed

175:40 - um
175:42 - yeah and there's like a lot of machine
175:43 - learning used to uh generate all these
175:46 - visual visuals and projections and
175:49 - motion capture and
175:53 - a bunch of technology many robots help
175:56 - me make this as effective as it should
175:58 - be beautiful we've made quite a
176:00 - delightful

177:09 - sort of change
177:10 - what they look like uh you know
177:13 - depending on
177:14 - the nature of the scene and it just it's
177:16 - there's kind of a story that tells us
177:18 - about the cycle of resource consumption
177:20 - um and sort of how how all these three
177:23 - environments interact with each other
177:24 - and feed into each other and there's
177:25 - this system that kind of works
177:26 - beautifully together
177:28 - so are you going to do a performance of
177:30 - it sure all right so why don't we uh

179:30 - cents about your project yeah um i'm
179:33 - hansel lee um
179:34 - i made a like a very very good uh
179:37 - breeding uh forest
179:40 - so those are elements are like indicator
179:42 - abstract traits
179:44 - so by different positions making a
179:46 - different type of space which can
179:49 - give people like a move inside
179:55 - [Music]
180:06 - also the trees are part of nature as
180:08 - well so among the elements of nature it
180:10 - could be exchangeable and replaceable
180:13 - and collected
180:15 - so yeah so i would like to give people
180:18 - just experiencing
180:20 - like
180:22 - inside of the space how they feel it
180:25 - like how uh nature reacts to the human
180:28 - being's reading as well
180:37 - broken um i can do it by manual
180:41 - so before like actually this is
180:43 - my original thing um so
180:47 - when uh foreign
180:49 - it's alone it's breeding their own
180:53 - speed like this
180:55 - and then
180:56 - but once someone's just inside of the
180:59 - corridor
181:20 - [Music]
181:31 - thanks
181:40 - uh just tell us your name and a few
181:42 - sentences about your project sure so my
181:43 - name is vanessa and i made a levitating
181:46 - cube
181:47 - um basically how it works is that this
181:49 - is an electromagnet and i'm running 12
181:52 - current 12 volts through it and then
181:54 - this is a neodymium magnet and what it
181:57 - does it's basically creating kind of
181:58 - like a push-pull dance so when i place
182:01 - it here
182:02 - this red led will turn on and that's
182:05 - kind of how you know that you've hit the
182:06 - sweet spot um and i'm also able to
182:08 - control
182:09 - the distance through this potentiometer
182:12 - um really finicky but very very cool
182:14 - you've gotten a lot of practice i can
182:16 - see oh my god yes
182:17 - before it was like
182:18 - so if i move it too close it'll start to
182:20 - go kind of crazy and it'll stick um
182:23 - and that's that's amazing how big do you
182:25 - think you could make this
182:27 - um like would it work at a much larger
182:29 - scale yeah so if i had a bigger
182:31 - electromagnet um it could carry a pound
182:34 - two pounds three pounds
182:36 - this can carry about an ounce more or
182:37 - less so like a piece of toast is its max
182:39 - yeah
182:40 - put it first next show yeah
182:53 - okay okay can you introduce yourself you
182:56 - can say a couple sentences about your
182:57 - project yes
182:59 - where do i touch you talk to here this
183:00 - is just extra audio
183:02 - lizzie chappini and sydney myers and our
183:05 - project's called color field
183:07 - and it's a interactive light display
183:10 - where the controller can't see what
183:12 - they're manipulating on the
183:15 - screen and the
183:16 - viewer can't see what the controller is
183:19 - doing so through communication they
183:21 - build a light display yeah and the
183:24 - kind of premise of it is we are asking
183:26 - people to choose a word
183:28 - and have a quick conversation about what
183:30 - colors that word evokes for them and so
183:32 - when they sit down at their stations
183:34 - either at the controller or the viewer
183:35 - they're trying to come together
183:37 - with a common goal of having the screen
183:40 - show the color composition of colors
183:43 - that they've kind of talked about to
183:45 - represent the work
183:47 - and have people been successful yeah
183:49 - pretty successful yeah it's really
183:51 - interesting to see how everybody
183:52 - communicates and what
183:55 - they're using you guys want to try
183:57 - definitely let me reset it
184:02 - okay
184:04 - so
184:05 - let's just choose optimism for you okay
184:09 - cool yes
184:11 - and what kinds of colors are evocative
184:13 - of the word optimism
184:15 - um
184:16 - yellow orange
184:18 - red
184:19 - um
184:20 - purple
184:29 - um
184:31 - yellow orange
184:33 - red
184:48 - now you're green now you're pink
184:51 - purple yeah
184:53 - yes you got it you got it perfect are we
184:55 - looking at that or what yeah this is
184:56 - great
184:57 - you get some footage of him just
184:58 - operating the controls
185:01 - and then these are the controls
185:06 - yeah so i'm not sure what's happening uh
185:08 - so she has to tell me what these
185:09 - controllers do
185:11 - and um i think this is like brightness
185:13 - on this one can we make one yellow
185:15 - you're just you just made it all right
185:18 - now it's purple
185:20 - okay um i don't know how to change it
185:25 - great job
185:26 - okay
185:27 - hey we kind of saw like all the projects
185:35 - see everything and look around and
185:36 - listen and then we will have set times i
185:39 - think yeah there's only one project next
185:42 - to the entrance that is
185:46 - so we're going to attempt to take the
185:47 - stairs
185:48 - and we'll see how that goes we might
185:51 - lose our wi-fi that's the other thing
185:52 - who knows what's going to happen wi-fi
185:54 - wise in the lobby although presumably
185:57 - they're all weak
186:12 - wow we have full troop here
186:15 - this is incredible
186:23 - look at all the
186:25 - construction in the stairwell uh very
186:28 - low or yes
186:31 - does it still record
186:32 - yeah well it will it's not recording
186:34 - it's
186:35 - straight yeah it's uploading straight
186:37 - okay
186:49 - so
186:57 - [Music]
187:22 - interfaces for musical expression so we
187:24 - build so we build our own
187:27 - musical instrument and then we perform
187:29 - with it
187:30 - um so
187:32 - my performance did not look like this
187:33 - but it's also a very physical
187:34 - performance and as you can hear it
187:37 - produces a lot of different dissident
187:39 - interesting chaotic sounds
187:40 - [Music]
187:44 - well thank you thank you
187:48 - [Music]
187:57 - i don't
187:59 - [Music]
188:05 - i don't know
188:13 - [Music]
188:41 - [Music]
188:50 - [Music]
189:02 - can you just tell us your name in a few
189:03 - sentences about the project yes mark
189:05 - matsumoto's uh this gentleman wants to
189:07 - play actually maybe get some
189:08 - demonstration at the same time awesome
189:10 - feel free to be aggressive with it so we
189:12 - have basically a controller and we have
189:14 - a
189:15 - synthesizer over there uh two different
189:17 - components so what we have going on is
189:19 - uh ribbon controllers or soft
189:21 - potentiometers on the right hand side
189:23 - and that's controlling your frequency
189:24 - underneath those soft potentiometers are
189:27 - fsrs force sensors um so that's going to
189:29 - control your amplitude so two other
189:31 - potentiometers are soft potentiometers
189:33 - that control
189:34 - uh
189:36 - dynamic and time-based effects um we
189:38 - have a low-pass filter with resonance
189:40 - and we have amplitude modulation
189:42 - uh reverb which is a 0-100 and a global
189:46 - output um but
189:48 - no we've got a technical issue okay hold
189:50 - on a second um let me see like just the
189:53 - capture obviously disconnected
189:57 - that was audio much earlier yeah but i'm
190:00 - just trying to call on skype
190:07 - it's like product description oh god 30
190:09 - seconds
190:16 - [Music]
190:26 - very cool man thank you so much
190:28 - appreciate you sweet oh thank you
190:29 - appreciate it sorry you can finish your
190:30 - sentence now we'll get oh i don't know
190:32 - where is that so we have effects
190:34 - processing on the left hand side six
190:36 - ribbons uh front hand side we have a few
190:38 - knobs um this is for actually sweeping
190:40 - between two different types of
190:41 - oscillators uh square and
190:44 - sawtooth i had to think about that uh
190:46 - three potentiometers three lap switches
190:48 - um
190:49 - each one of these coordinates with their
190:51 - own oscillators so in the
190:53 - as themselves the oscillators for the
190:55 - entire strip it's one octave if we
190:57 - actually have it held down
191:00 - we can go all the way up to three
191:01 - octaves
191:03 - actually hold down at the bottom
191:09 - and we'll go down to that single octave
191:14 - and as mentioned these latches
191:16 - these allow me to actually feed my hands
191:17 - to do something else like
191:23 - so as you see i'm playing standing up
191:25 - right now actually made this to sit down
191:27 - which i'm gonna do and i can do because
191:29 - they're lost
191:31 - so i'll get to that third oscillator
191:36 - [Music]
191:47 - [Music]
191:54 - we're gonna do something kind of
191:55 - dramatic because
191:57 - [Music]
192:11 - so it's really a struggle it's about
192:13 - patience actually finding where you need
192:14 - to be and then adjusting accordingly
192:16 - i've only had a few hours on this so i'm
192:18 - still trying to figure out actually
192:19 - where to play this but i've seen some
192:20 - other people do some interesting things
192:22 - on this
192:23 - thank you so much
192:26 - [Music]
192:37 - [Music]
192:42 - we built a interactive composition
192:44 - together it's an insulation and a piece
192:46 - of music at the same time
192:48 - can you perform it for us yes
192:53 - [Music]
193:05 - [Music]
193:18 - so
193:21 - [Music]
193:33 - so
193:36 - [Music]
194:12 - [Music]
194:35 - thank you so much
194:36 - great thank you uh there's one
194:39 - cool
194:42 - just introduce yourself and tell us a
194:43 - couple sentences then we'll go watch you
194:44 - before yeah i'm joe baker uh this is my
194:47 - performance called ronin it's about a
194:49 - disbanded warrior
194:50 - trying to relive this motions of war
194:54 - try to get him out of his head
194:56 - and
194:57 - this is
195:02 - [Music]
195:16 - so

199:29 - my name is douglas douglas gold's name
199:32 - here i am with midi blade
199:34 - and i am using the sport of the
199:37 - electronic sport of fencing as my
199:39 - influence toward um
199:41 - finding expression from combat toward a
199:43 - musical output and the human body is an
199:46 - interface for a musical expression
199:50 - so
199:51 - for
199:52 - my basic model here
199:56 - i'm running
199:58 - arduino nano through bluetooth ble
200:02 - and
200:04 - i have it set up so that the pitch and
200:06 - the roll the roll changes my notes
200:10 - for the rotation of my wrist
200:12 - and then
200:15 - [Music]
200:27 - sure
200:29 - [Music]
200:31 - so i'm gonna turn you up now
200:34 - [Music]
200:54 - like if we do
200:58 - [Music]
201:03 - and now let's try doing the same thing
201:06 - [Music]
201:19 - is
201:24 - [Music]
201:26 - and every time you play you'll have a
201:28 - new generative composition as the output
201:31 - so
201:32 - i'm excited to keep developing it thank
201:34 - you very much
201:37 - [Music]
201:38 - i don't know i don't know how many
201:40 - projects that was
201:41 - 128.
201:45 - knows exactly how many of us just give a
201:48 - big thank you to everybody who's been
201:50 - helping with this

Cleaned transcript:

um oh you know what would be good hello we might be live streaming right now um are there captions that are appearing obviously nobody's looking at the chat so we do have a little bit of a bug in our system um here what i'm going to do is say i have it up on my computer over there so first let me say a quick hello just assuming it's working but yeah if somebody has a phone and wants to like just go to it you'll be able to see the live chat um my name is dan schiffman this is a live stream that's happening on a youtube channel called the coding train but this is a little bit of a special episode in that um we i'm going to show you the itp ima winter show so it i itv is a graduate program ima has an undergraduate program at new york university school of the arts it's where i teach where i make a lot of the video tutorials that i have on the channel um people are saying the captions are there and so um we're going to walk around there's all there's like literally six of us here right now and we have the most elaborate setup ever so there's this microphone i should i should point out that this microphone is not actually something that you're hearing right now this is just recording backup additional audio it's actually probably way too close to my face right now it should be more about here this phone attached to it is also on a skype call with a live captioner give yourself a shout out live capture in the live captions who is live captioning i have a feeling the live captions aren't going to work so well this is the first time we're trying to do it but we're going to do our best and then the actual audio that you're hearing i'm tapping the mic so hopefully you heard like there's messages coming in so what i'm going to do right now is i'm going to take this prop which is like our microphone speaker it's like this what's the thing where you have like the speaker box or the you know when you're at like a meeting and you want people to speak one of the times you have to hold oh it's the top one the talking stick this is the talking stick which we will pass around um so i'm going to pass over these are our student show producers um i'm going to let them introduce themselves and talk about the show and idp and what it is and whatever they want and i'm going to go check just sort of like the the analytics page and the chat and all that make sure things are and then we'll start looking at projects thank you to ellen behind the camera chelsea and jesse over here are helping and i'll hand this to you bye hi everyone i'm i'm patrick warren i'm a first year itp student hi i'm daphne i'm second year itp student i'm a lighting designer cool and uh so i guess we'll walk outside and check out the show right so we're gonna say what we're doing oh what we're doing doing whatever they want we did a beautiful map together of all of the projects on the floor this year special because we have a beautiful space and we have more than 100 projects so that's a lot of projects to go through for a visitor so we made a map that has numbers laid out on a floor plan and then a description no not a description the name of the project the student and you know it's color coded according to where it is in the so that was our job yeah do you want to add anything i think she is so that's it should we go look at some projects let's go okay i'm like so like i don't have my phone i don't have my phone because it's over there um so i guess i'll take this now and i'll i'll get us rolling and then we can kind of like alternate around all right so we're gonna attempt now to look at projects students are still setting up their projects um but uh maybe is the boxing glove in action all right let's go check out the boxing glove so uh what we're going to attempt to do is um so ellen i think like the closer you get okay the better just for the audio and then um you can we're gonna like keep the camera on you and the mic on you just to do like describe the project and then separately you can demo it because as soon as we're trying to like shoot video of demoing it we'll lose your audio sure okay say your name and your project and then a few sentences about it uh hi my name is punch punch revolution basically what it is is a machine learning gesture classifier on the under the hood but on the hood if as you can see it's a fun punching game where you need to complete a certain amount of tasks in a limited amount of time uh the entire technology is happening inside this very small thing over here as a demo and if somebody wants to try it out we can have a go at it should i try or do you want to demonstrate oh i can demo it yeah okay so basically if i need to make a significant enough gesture ideally it should so that's how it roughly books and the general purpose of the entire project is to uh go into us like early deep dive into like what can be possible just using people's gestures as a medium of interaction okay all right so introduce yourself say your names and a few sentences about your project hi my name is and this is our project general photography so basically it's an experiment we did like to figure out what's in between analog photography and digital technology so what you're seeing now is the result of our experiment so we ran a journey through from the very basic analog photography the pinhole cameras where you expose a piece of light sensitive paper to light over a certain period of time and then you can capture out light expose the paper and how it carves these like the traces of line on this piece of paper and then we try to reproduce the same process by using a digital way so basically for example we have a series of images and then we use the technique that is used in analog photography to expose a digital canvas with the images from that series of maybe for example for a performance in a dense images from a dance performance and then we did the negative analog negative of that these printed results which turn out you could have like this a piece of photography which is digital based but it has the texture and aesthetics of an analog photography and here's the video showcasing like the digital exposure process during the whole digital print like how it is made digitally yes okay i'm getting a bunch of this phone is buzzing like crazy which i assume it's not it's somebody who's instagram messaging this phone is it going today are you going today hold on there's somebody this is a an official nyu phone that i think someone left their instagram signed in on but let me uh let me try to look at the skype because i think the captioner is sending me some messages let me look at the chat all right this is me testing uh speaking directly into the money okay this is perfect shoot that separately and then move on to getting cool detail uh hi my name is noah um and um so we're trying to because we're we're doing like a lot of live streams let's do it at different things hi my name is noah i'm a first year at itp um and my project is sort of about uh video collage and machine learning fantastic but i don't know why i just did this yeah cool all right so give us a i give you a demo yeah okay so basically what's going on here are there our live stream streaming cameras on the floor and you can play with them so what i'm gonna do right here is if we look at stream three you can see all of us right now and i'm gonna make our heads appear on our sort of body collage so by using this controller come on oh right it's it's stream three i changed it to stream one so there we go in one second and there we go so now it's all of our heads as part of this so i can make our bodies show up too um stream three so in a second you'll see a big orange blob hopefully for shiffman's body i wore this orange sweater specifically for this demo let's see if i can get it to swap there we go so it allows you to play with these streams to sort of create a human collage if you know the game exquisite corpses um the colloquial version of that is the game that you play with drawing pictures that was an inspiration for this thank you thank you so we checked the blue blocks are you activated with your blocks you're having a nice like cup of tea or something okay coffee okay so tell us your name and a few sentences about your project so my name is demis and my project is basically a black puzzle game when you can build the correct sentence the animation is basically a hint about what is the sentence and you have to slide the blocks into the box to complete that sentence let's see can you show us a demo of it yeah so yeah and the tomato is bouncing and then you pass to the next sentence you have to use the green box in this case so you can remove this one this is basically like a learning tool for kids the cara no say that try again so thank you okay like my goals okay great great my goal is to like uh do as many projects as possible so with this previous years we would so i'm kind of we're just doing the rapid fire okay um tell us your name in a few sentences about your project and then we'll kind of go and look at some of the uh specific parts because there's so many yeah um hi i'm winnie um and so these are from my data class i'm from hong kong so i did a lot of projects about the protests and specifically focusing on the narratives um i'm really interested in nontraditional um approaches to protests um and the focus of narrative is because i feel like our ability to craft our own narrative is something that's really powerful and healing um so these are all different projects about um narratives and distances um yeah sorry um no so this two projects are about police and um protesters uh and so i have these youtube videos that i scripted transcript um from and i did these generative texts uh and also with the most common words i made these fridge magnets that people could interact with and then this piece here is all the protest information i have consumed from september up until now so as you hover you could see the articles and the brighter the box is the more articles i have read in that hour of the day and then the last one there is more about media rendering because a lot of times when we read the same information we could have very different interpretations so i was curious to see if i could create a system for us to even understand that um so what i did is that i create this framework where i have this article which is compiled by a number of prochina and prohong kong media articles um and i asked people to select the three most important sentences and then to type uh words and response and also pick uh the headline images that they think is the most appropriate and also ask a little bit about whether they have been following the protests and after they did that they could see everyone's responses thank you okay i'm gonna just uh because i'm feeling very paranoid i'm gonna see if i can get the youtube chat going on this phone also i'm just gonna check speaker has to be closer to the mic so we're gonna do our best let's see we're going to do a little checkin maybe you're saying a lot of important things in the chat so i don't know how to use this phone youtube search this is a really cool project okay good i'm more looking for people saying like the stream's not working i can't hear anything um but the chat looks good okay okay great no it's all going very well usually the chat is just full of people com not not complaining complaining is the wrong word very nicely providing constructive critique about what the technology is not doing properly but i think we might have finally got all the right pieces here all right yeah we come in here okay so we're kind of doing this quick uh rapid fire glimpses of everybody's projects so they can tell us your names uh in a few sentences about your project and then we'll also go around and shoot some footage more closely and i can see that it's much longer than it was yesterday yes i'm naila davis and i'm simone salvo and we also have another collaborator elizabeth perez who's not yesterday but together we all may say her name which is an interactive portrait it's commemorating the life of sandra sandra bland commemorating and celebrating her life so what we did was used um these this process called internal total internal reflection and we printed this image on lucite so the idea is that when you walk past the sensor it'll detect that you're there and when you say her name sandra bland this will end up printing if it goes well we've been having some um some some small technical difficulties with our ultrasonic sensor so as everything at itp this has become a um a prototype more than a finished piece and we're really learning through this experience of having people see it like what we would do differently how we would change it and also seeing how it changes as people interact with it for sure like when the first roll of paper came down it was like okay what do we do now right let's just leave it so i want to try to say it again say sandra bland p5 is hearing you but i guess you guys come back another i know you're gonna have to come back it's printed this many times there is a delay also so sometimes when you say the name it'll end up printing um but we've also noticed that this ultrasonic sensor in communication with p5 causes some type of lags that we can't necessarily detect and sometimes you know the the medium of digital media shows through and we get that we'll fix it all in post thank you great job congratulations thank you for sharing thanks guys hello tell us your name and a few sentences about your project yeah hi my name is and i work this with clingy it's called behind a toe so you have to go to the back of the tube to see the detector project so what can you just give us the explanation first and then we'll go look behind you okay um so people always look at the front of the talk and we want people to actually see what is behind and what's the relationship between people who have been passed away and people who are alive and visiting them so uh the movement and also the sound of the people who are alive will actually if that's what the topes movement be like we want to use this to talk about the relationship and discuss that so that's it instagram notifications hello uh tell us your name and a few sentences about your project oh this is a vr project this will be hard but you can but there's you have excellent display of extra information fantastic it's marcel oliver yeah so it's my name and it's a vr project that's like based on compositional experimentation in vr unfortunately i'm not sure quite how to show it right you're welcome to look at it yourself yeah i'll come back i would love to see it um but yeah it's kind of a nonnarrative art piece thank you so we're doing quick uh summaries of people's projects i'm very excited about this so just tell us your name names uh maybe stand next to each other if that's okay um and then we'll get you doing a quick explanation then we'll also then show people the project oh yeah okay i'm chanel i'm eating and this is our game authentic or not um it is a cooking game that teaches you how to cook traditional indian and chinese recipes and now we can just show you the how it works push the button and then drum rolls so now we are choosing chinese green pepper with pork and you can either use your hands or spoon to choose whatever you think is right for the dish and then keep growing now is the [Laughter] to get the traditional recipes and learn more about our project on our website and if you get more than 60 percent we are gifting some indian and chinese snacks yes yes thank you so much yeah thank you so much all right uh oh we got all three okay tell us your names about your product hold on let's let's hold it take it from the top it's so fast we need the microphones yeah i'm sure yeah and we made our believable news project and this is an installation and and about fake news yeah and basically you can see the news before you wear these glasses and if you wear these glasses you can see a piece of news and it says hong kong high court band black holes in public space and where 30 people were arrested and this image actually looks totally makes sense for this uh news that if you change to another glasses you can see a different version of this news this is our secret here yeah i can touch here and trigger this and you can see another piece of news happening in berlin also makes sense for this image and if you change to another glasses and you can see also see another group it says customers in shanghai fight for shirts and people will don't know which is true and which is fake and after they say sing all of the news and they could share this news to other person and this is those three are the news they sword and if i want to share like a high court band black clothes in public space and i can just share it if i share it and it will tell you it is a misinformation or the real news and yeah the message you just shared will appears on other people's screen and the message you just shared with other people will affect other people's uh final decision about which is real and which is fake so we made this project basically we want to let people to know to to question the genuineness of the image because many people think the image actually are the evidence of the events so and so the second step for our project we want people to know that actually their behavior is affecting other people they are not only the consumer of fake news they are also the enhancer of the fake news influences yeah thank you thank you thank you thank you i like it we're all applauded all right we're just going to keep going through all these projects all right tell us your name in a few seconds about your project my name is jason and i'm the creator of this project it's called optimize optimize is a tailor made mouse designed to fit everybody's head so um so this is the prototype uh the electronics i made all the like industrial design and also in the tronics coating and everything i start from here it's a dummy mouse and i model it on top with playdoh so it fits my hand perfectly so i did some photogrammetry which is powered by machine learning and reconstructed the model into a digital scan of my hand and it turned into a real mouse model and get 3d printed so it becomes the model you see here so it's a ergonomic mouse and because a mouse is the most dependent peripheral which is uh to your hand size and grip so this is the perfect solution for me and hopefully it's going to be a business in the future thank you congratulations okay oh yes let's take a look at this oh can you guys come and talk about your project yeah okay let's let's let's get you giving a quick explanation and then we can try to demo it and get some footage all right say your name first too you do my name my name is cezar khan and our project is called the joys of being a screensaver and it's an interactive video installation with four channels of video and one rotary phone uh the concept is that a human is stuck as your screen saver and you can interact with her by calling her on the rotary phone and by her calling you on the phone and it's just the back and forth between the real world and the digital world between you making the character move on the four screens around you and fur making you turn around all right should we try it we got somebody trying it already this is so good yeah so she's behind me so that's so cute so now i call back right what number am i dialing you can dial in two five seven okay oh she's here that's it right i did it right hello all right we're coming over here tell us your name hello and a few sentences about your project my name is hayek my name is tonic our project called artifice is about we can try to testing that human can live with a robot in the future and robot can replace human or not so our concept is the test that you have to identify who is a human and who is a robot it's a mother it's like a turing test but in a vr environment so we try to embrace a human connection between two people in vr so i would like to demo you we need one person who is going to be the actor and one person is going to be the judge i guess okay and we need we need one we need one more to be a judge so your mission is try to help him identify that you are human okay but among the experience there's a lot of robots that look like you okay and try to pretend to be you okay so you have to give them a clue that hey this is me okay i'm the human i'm human i'm human you're a robot oh i'm a robot but yes that's right that's right so i will set you up here okay and i need one person yeah to be a judge right so in this we combine like we are experienced and server client so you're going to be the server you're going to be the judge okay so you don't have to do anything okay you just observe i can do that and uh and you can identify he's a human or not at the end of the game usually take off your headset and then you come out and say is that you all right did you see anything i see it yeah this is the point of view that you will see for me oh they're dancing dancing yeah [Laughter] yeah i was okay so do you know which one is a human i was thinking the one on the right but i don't know i can't tell you so you think the one on the right yeah yeah so how do you feel that you get tricked by the machine machines are too smart man you help him identify yes yeah i didn't you know i think i if i had a second chance i think i might have more of a sense of like what some strategy might be i was just even going into the vr headsets no disadvantage but do you think like his movement is different than others than other robots in the center well i guess i was thinking about the road on the right so i started once i like thought it was that when i started focusing on that one more um so i kind of ignored the other two after a while um i guess i was also trying to figure out how that would move from what i've seen sid isn't here but this is a really fun a little arcade i can explain this project or do you want do you guys know about this project okay so this is project from sid who's not here maybe we can come back again to introduce it but it's a it's a small arcade um that's built with an arduino inside and you can select a whole bunch of different games it looks like they're playing tetris right now so take a look it's really cute looks like we have a professional tetris player here okay let's uh should we go around here there is all right hello can you give us a couple sentences about tell us your name in a couple sentences hi i'm borah uh so this is variations on computational association i'm feeding in my artwork and the neural network is trying to guess what it's saying and then recreate what it's saying uh but the premise of premise is it has to create something so it has to take liberties and combining stuff that hasn't seen combined before so it's sort of inadvertently creating some abstract art in in response to my art which is similar to what we do how we react to abstract ideas if okay are you using runway yes this probably is quite involved yes but can you give us a quick summary of the game of the project and then we'll like shoot some stairs but i don't know we'll have time to play it but pretty much it's just an oldfashioned board game uh i'm trying to solve the problem of our major games i have to deal with strategy and family being together namely monopoly risk and murder not having to deal with war murder or or bankruptcy so my game is called jackrabbits and you play with regular poker cards and basically what you're trying to do is that you're these rabbits that live in this kingdom and not trying to find a king a queen and a jack to officiate the wedding in this in the in the castle it comes with tiles so every time you play you create a different kingdom a different board and in the game what you do is you navigate through it trying to find the royal cards so in that sense it's like you're collecting properties like you would do with monopoly but instead of like trying to get your your opponent to go bankrupt you're just trying to arrange this wedding before they do did you make all of these pieces i made everything and design and everything um it's made out of mdf and it's laser cut and this is just like a sticker photo uh printed with a inkjet printer and i built the digital version of the board with v5 which you can actually put together and rotate it i'll show you let me restart it the idea is that um if i still have to figure out how to get this into production maybe do a kickstarter but in the meantime i'll put this online and people will be able to play with their own uh poker card so if you have a deck of cards you don't need to wait for me to produce the actual board to be able to play john graves awesome great job i really want to come and play it yeah what you don't know is lachlan was our sound check person yesterday they've really rehearsed uh their project description not really but okay so tell us your name which you have already uh spoiler alert lachlan and uh a little bit a few sentences about your project hey so i'm lachlan i'm a firstyear student here at ima uh and so i made a website called gun funded and it's a visualization of the gun lobby's funding of u.s congress cool do you want to like screw i mean people can go what's the url for the project it's gunfunded.com so maybe we can get a little footage of you scrolling through it but yeah so on the website you can enter your home address to find your representative or you can explore so here we are in brooklyn um and so unsurprisingly our representative here is not funded by gun rights groups those received a little bit of money from net control groups but you can also see some of the top funded congress people or you can explore by state um and so like where i'm from in pennsylvania um you can you can see the total um and how the funding is disproportionately um goes to uh republican men in congress and so you can go to anyone's profile you can share these you can see lists of top senators representatives and more and there's also a view of the pacs that give money so you can see that um like in 2018 there was 22 million given to congress but in 2016 it was 58 million and so basically every year up until um just recently the graphs looked like this um because congress has received about 40 million dollars from gun rights groups and about 5 million from gun control groups and so you can also click to filter the list and see like how much money the nra specifically is given every year um or or any other group so that's gun funded and it's gunfunded.com thank you thanks hello will you tell us your name in a few sentences about your project yes my name is veronica alfaro this is a this is a breathing exercise so the way that it works is you squeeze the ball and you inhale at the same time that you release the ball and you exhale you're supposed to follow the pattern that this hexagon is giving you and there is also some sound coming out of the headphones that is also guiding your breathing so the idea is that people can have some sensory input at the same time some visual input to calm and relax and this is targeted for people with anxiety and who are suffering from a lot of anxiety before wonderful job i can attest i tried this yesterday and it really helped me calm down in a wonderful way thank you great one more time thank you yeah okay oh hello we're back let's go stream into this uh oh wait we've got a bunch of things that we'll come here first okay all right who's uh is this just just you emily yes okay so um tell us your name which i just said and a few sentences about your project okay hi my name is emily my project is called racing thoughts and it's a selfreflective experience it's really simple you're just asked to write two sentences about yourself who wants to try it it's a little bit different definitely okay we can we can blur out anything you write that's very i'm gonna ask people there's only like you know hundreds of thousands of people watching this right now yeah i think it's about 162. it's not anonymous type a negative sentence oh i could take over if you want i've got lots of negative things to say oh god no about myself the key to happiness is in accepting your thoughts all of them even the bad ones accept your thoughts don't become them understand for instance that having a sad thought even having a continuous succession of sabbath is not this is so nice so it says it took you 12.7 seconds to say something negative 4.5 seconds to say something positive racing cards by emily's hour thank you yeah of course this is really nice wonderful great job i had the pressure [Laughter] hello how are you okay tell us your name and a few sentences about your project my name is karina and this is frame by frame i'm trying to get people to collaboratively tell a story through gifts and so each person is contributing one frame to the story all right should we try to add one so this is the word and you'll have two frames with which to represent okay there was a little boy trying this yesterday so i have two frames and as more people come and add frames then you can read more and more of the story and try to understand based on their gifts and how people chose to represent the words and if you've tried to understand then you compare it to the original story it's really fun i wouldn't have thought you would get so much out of just two frames yeah but it's it's amazing it's really surprising how people choose to represent thank you thanks all right all right uh tell us your name and a few sentences about your project my name is lulu and this is an installation that show everybody has a mountain on their original home and this is how it works and i have to tell the rock what is the shape of my hands and i want everybody to have a natural connection let's come over okay hello um can you tell us your name in a few sentences about your project okay hi i'm lee my project is voicemail so it's the wiser active mirror so when you speak in a blue microphone i'm going to reacting like with the mirror should we try yeah sure i'm going to combine cry for me and your favorite song don't cry for me louder my nostril is so beautiful it's really not it's not no it's not no i can't like you want to demonstrate yeah wow let's have you explain the project and we'll play through some of it we're trying to get through as many things i don't know if we can go through the full experience but let's see let's see how it goes okay uh so tell us your names why don't you all come stand together okay okay um and then and describe it first then we'll we'll try playing my name's nick grant you don't have to speak right into it i'm tina welcome to death is imminent but let's have fun in this four player game users must communicate with each other in order to fix its effective spacecraft all right so who wants to play we need four players we got people playing all right all right this is gonna be very hard to caption so for those of you reading the capsule.com put this uh this is the light for the captioner we're just gonna put that in the center and then we'll just go my senses tell me that the earth is in the state of despair it is cracking apart and mankind's time on earth is coming to an end we need to take off immediately i understand that you do not know how to operate a spacecraft that is okay the instructions are in your console because you need to do them before the countdown is over otherwise you will damage the ship too much damage and we will all die did you get that good starting preparation sequence in five four three two one new instructions you have 50 seconds new instructions you have 45 seconds uncovered cool foreign right all right still 10 live instructions you have 40 seconds no that's the bottom you're off to a great start the engine is new rios you have 27 seconds the motors are turning faster new instructions you have 24 seconds slide over the top slide uh is you can accomplish anything up you have eight seconds thank you for praying tell us your name in a few seconds sure hi i'm adrian bautista a second year graduate student at itv um i built this project called public message which is meant to explore you know how do physical locations and augmented reality shape public discussions um so basically i mean if you want to do a quick demo yeah let's tell us tell us the spiel and then because it's sort of sure the audio will be lost i mean i guess it's becoming more common now for air content to appear in public spaces from like pokemon go to the jeff kuhn snapchat collaboration but then the question of like who kind of controls that space like is it the platform or is it the people who create the content or is the people who actually own the space or if it's a public space is it the government um so just kind of want to kick out that conversation as ar becomes more and more popular more prevalent um so what i did was i built a little app where i'm just a simple qr sticker you just any smartphone that can read a qr it'll open up a web ar experience so there's no app you have to download or anything it gives you a little pointer about how to set it up start it and when you point it and so there's a little prompt and then you could always reply to say like i wouldn't i wouldn't like sponsor content on my door the content there so people can kind of discuss in a physical space that's there but not really there so yeah fantastic great job thank you uh tell us your name and a couple sentences about your project i'm jenny i'm a second year icp student my project is an ar audio visual healing system that take you through my love story in new york city and most of the stories happen in washington square park so the experience is actually mapped in washington square park and how the real experience is that you follow this transparent tube and it will lead you to a location where there's this big reveal of like selflove it's kind of like a metaphor of how when people are in relationship there's like tunnel vision they only see one point and it's like you know when people are doing are there focusing on their phone and it looks ridiculous for people from the outside and hopefully hopefully in the end with the big reveal people can take in the beauty of the world and we focus on themselves that's why it's selflove yeah would you like to try yeah um yes so the audio only comes through the headphones yeah yes so because it's mapped to washington square park that's why you can only experience the very last bit of of the experience like the revealing part and it's not mapped here so you have to be careful not to bump into people if you wanna try okay let's try for a couple minutes so do you see the transparency and how you play the audio is by putting a tube in the middle of the screen to make it solid that's the only time when the audio will play and then this is the the revealing part but yeah you can see where the tube is it's a very large scale so you can walk like way is it a circle it was supposed to be in the park so it would be a walk but just not so that's why i have the documentation video on to tell you what the real experience supposed to be like okay thank you let's come over here uh tell us your names and a couple sentences about your project i'm maya and i'm kara i our project is a data visualization that uses augmented reality to um look at housing unaffordability in the lower east side in manhattan um so why do you want to show your home yeah so um basically if you pick up this ipad um and you look at the map side um it's gonna show you a hundred people then if you click on this little icon in the corner it will bring up some facts so first it's gonna show you the median um side then it's going to show you what apartment rent the immediate income is in that same area and there's a pretty stark contrast of those two numbers and then it shows you how that actually affects people's ability to live in that area so it talks about this thing called the 40 times rule and the 40 times rule states that you must make 40 times a monthly rent in income per year in order to be allowed to rent so this is something that happens when you're applying for a new place so if maya goes ahead and closes it but we wanted to show the disparity of the people that are living in this area so slowly they start to fade away and this is to show you that of the population of 158 000 in the lower east side truly only eight percent of them would be able to live there according to the 40 times rule and so that's what remains thank you all right let's go over to all right hello there will you tell us your name and a couple sentences about your project and then you can demo it as well okay i'm eva i'm a second year at itv um and so i made a chrome extension that goes over a browsing page and highlights the co2 emissions that are produced during um during internet use internet browsing so i can show you if you want basically this chrome extension adds these bubbles to the tops of any webpage and when when you load a web page a new bubble appears and the size of the bubble estimates the grams of co2 that's produced um during that paid load um and then it sort of it calculates the grams of co2 produced during this browsing session and sort of tries to estimate the standard the miles that you could drive emitting that same amount of co2 in a standard car uh so all these numbers are very much estimates because it's something that's very hard to quantify but this was more sort of to show people outside of the itp community that don't really know about this to make them realize that the internet has physical consequences so yeah is it available in the chrome store not at the moment because i want to fix some of the numbers but um yes at some point and then i also just for fun um looked at the uh how many sort of api calls are made for twitter and like every second and then i also mapped my own um browsing throughout the week and just to see how many grams of co2 using my memories to see how much i'm producing how are you doing there ellen does your arm need to break maybe yeah because we could do some switching we could switch a room might recognize the song i don't know if this made it in on purpose or by accident it's still not sure it's a first coincidence i think of that i can download the patches okay there you go all right sorry to lead with that maybe all of you who worked on this could you gather in one spot and then um just tell us your name and a few sentences about your project okay my name is roy yeah i'm karen so this product came from that we found the electronics are so fascinating so we want to change them into other playful machines and we found all these things in the u.s u.s store like we bought the old friendly and the old tables and the old turntable and then we made this fan into a record player and that telephone into a rocket mode game and that turned over into a bubble machine actually it's a happiness generator machine great should we try each of them one at a time yeah sure yeah so this one is it mocks up the experience of playing a vinyl player and turns it on and then this is for changing the speed of the music okay uh okay then this is the workable game if you press this button the game will start and you can use the receptor to watch them anybody want to try like this did i break it okay and then oh you are shooting the secrets cool hold on okay so tell us your name before you put it on or tell us your name in a few seconds about your project okay yeah so where should i be looking are you looking wherever you want okay but you can look here um i'm andrea and so my project's a vr project um and it uses vr to tell a poetic experience about sorry about kind of exploring flashbacks and what it means to have control over our own experiences and memory yeah wonderful does anyone want to try it off yeah yeah of course you've done videos so you can adjust the headset and the interaction's super easy um you can just press take your time let me know if you need help i think i'm good okay yeah so super easy it's just a mouse press here i'm gonna put it in your hand okay this is you're gonna want to go towards the end but as you go on maybe you're not going to want them it's weird that you guys can see what i'm doing oh oh there's more okay cool all right um so that man that you see is supposed to represent trauma so the first time you go through this experience it's like going and walking around and you make something horrific happen um and now this part is supposed to represent how memory will kind of try to understand that so the memory if you've ever unfortunately experienced something like that you might replay that memory in your head over and over again um and if he ever chooses to stop he can stop time and stop everyone from moving but he can never prevent what's gonna happen and so he is like looping this memory and it's i just thought vr was a really cool way to describe such a specific experience with our minds and allow people to become immersed and also think a lot about that experience in a different way yeah wonderful thank you great job i'm just trying to keep going quite um so my name is eric i had this project it's called bouncing ball karaoke and you basically have this ball and like every time it bounces it goes like one word further i can show it i lyrics and that's a pretty long intro 30 seconds and like um time you hit the words you get like one point uh so i would say like seven more seconds all right okay so i feel the battery kind of dies but basically yeah every time it bounces it goes like one more further um and i can kind of maybe show it like without you know yeah so i guess that's it it is still your favorite song uh no i feel this is a song that kind of everyone knows so but not everyone seems to know it actually like but i think like 90 of the people here know it so it's yeah it's it's a fun song and it's also like really difficult to sing it in like a karaoke bar but like i'm trying to make like everyone able to actually sing it by while hearing the voice the actual singer and trying to hit it on like the right rhythm um yeah and i feel better that gets showed like working i have to change the battery which takes a while you changed the ball right yeah so basically it was like a rubber band yeah yeah it was oh yeah you're so easy for you to replace the bathroom yeah it is it is and it was very close up like a working prototype with like fully uh rubber but yeah unfortunately it's just this um well yeah all right thank you so much thank you jake jake uh hi so can you tell us your name and a little bit about your project sure i'm jake sherwood uh my project is called climatescape it's a kinetic art installation to raise awareness for climate change and the human effect on the climate it's representing four future potential climate change scenarios going from best case to worst case so as you progress through the installation it gets more and more chaotic cool so do you want to demonstrate it this is kind of producing more tranquil uh softer sound and then as you get through it gets more chaotic and becomes scary at the end can you talk a little bit about what the rcp values are uh sure so the rcp stands for representative concentration pathways it's actually a data modeling set that the the intergovernmental panel on climate change is opted for scientists around the world to be able to have a baseline for modeling specific climate change data points but it has these four various scenarios which allowed me to kind of paint a picture of best case the worst case for what will happen in the climate if we do everything to kind of correct the problems that we have or if we do nothing and all kind of cool all right thanks very much we have to be very close because of this okay so where uh can you tell us your name and a little bit about your project yes uh should i see the camera yes okay hi um my name is jacob i work with chiwen she's not here right now so our project is called around us it's about something that around us also around the earth so you can see here so when you wake up you always check the weather or when you want to go new place but you don't know where it is you have to use the map like google maps or atom maps but all those technologies are based on the satellites but we never think about that so we want to make some awareness through this project so they're there so we use open source data called the union of concerned scientists based on these data we made three visualization so first one is the timeline shows the from 974 to 2019 how many satellite launches based on these four categories severe government and commercial and military and you can see there's some question marks in here because this open source data is chosen by them so we actually don't know how many satellites launched during this so we pick some random numbers from this data and we want to show the so there's something more beyond this data and also based on this data there's a called world map visualization it shows uh how many satellites uh own each country each countries oh and how many satellites so obviously united states lead this industry so there's some lagging in my computer but at final united states has like more than 900 satellites and the final one is called the satellite showing the what kind of satellites around earth so if when you hover the mouse to the satellite you can see the detail of satellite images and lifespan operators who owned these satellites and also we printed out this to as a some kind of trading card like mba or mlb like we don't wanna make this too serious we just wanna make people more like just fun and a little bit of awareness about they're there like something around us yes that's all great job thank you thank you this way hello my name is matt ross i'm a second year at itp and i'm here to to talk to you about your relationship with your data daniel do you think you have a problem with data hoarding yes do you just every day wake up generate google documents spreadsheets pdfs and even powerpoints that are just living and sitting in your cloud services yes so what i have here today is a simple outlet but it's not just a simple outlet this outlet is connected directly to the servers at google and what it does is it looks for any documents that you haven't even looked at in over two years so let's say you gave a presentation just two and a half years ago is that really something that you need in your life is this something that's really sparking joy this project is sort of my my first step in trying to have a better relationship with my data and hopefully all of our data and so what you can do here today is one of two things you can take the extreme route authenticate pull the plug and delete everything that's older than two years here is a video of me doing exactly that and you can say i have a lot of useless stuff here um that i haven't looked at but that's a little bit extreme so i have made an alteration to this to kind of let us take the first step into a more healthy relationship with our data so what you can do today is log in and it will find just one single file and it'll show you what that file is and if you're ready you can pull the plug and it'll delete just that single file and maybe just let you take a step towards having data in your life that really makes you feel good and that it's important to you would you maybe want to uh i would but i'm going to have to two factor in my phone's over here yeah yeah we might need it you know what uh just for this for the sake of speed i can do it myself and i'll delete a one of my own files live in live stream so i'll show you how it works so obviously a big a big issue is privacy and keeping things safe so this all the code is open source and you can see how everything is working all the credentials are only stored just for this the sole time of the experience and um all the browsers are in incognito windows no sessions or anything get saved so you start it up you have a nice ascii art you have a blank page log in oh there we go all right don't don't worry about that it's a friendly suggestion so here are these these this is just the amount of things that any google chrome extension would ask of you allow okay so now the script is activating and it's see it's retrieving all documents from a year and a half ago and i have 10 total files that i haven't looked at in over 18 months and this is a file called life retro which i think has some life goals from a few years ago you know what i'm here at itp things going well let me uh let me get rid of this so here's this plug and when i pull this i'll have six seconds to change my mind see it's going gold you can still change it i think deletion of one file and and that's the whole process yeah i wanna i've i this is giving me a lot of anxiety yeah i feel like i need to like fully dive into this at some point totally and uh you know it's we should definitely talk but we have we have another uh we have i have another project here that i've worked on with the lovely diamond alkas which is a lot less invasive oh what a nice segue yes oh let's come over here welcome to our partnership here you've introduced yourself and now you can introduce yourself and uh tell us a few words about your project sure i'm donna i'm a second here uh here at itp and i've worked together with matt we developed a new team called url data where obviously you can see healthy data starts here and we really wanted to raise awareness of the browser hygiene and the fact that we are constantly keeping our bodies clean and whenever we leave the public space we hand sanitize our hands but our phone is no less public than the train and our browser is no less public than the train or any place that we're visiting so we want to show you uh something that we've developed in the past few weeks i'm going to take my phone here and i'm going to scan this qr code it's going to send me to a safari webpage um nothing too fancy about it it's just the p5 sketch asking me insert your phone into the container now i'm going to uh turn on our machine and put this lovely little phone in here now all our goal today is basically to delete your or clear your browsing history so i'm gonna come here to this corel lovely perel and i'm gonna use it and if you would take a look here my browsing history has been cleared and that's it we really encourage you all to think about doing that every time that you use a hand sanitizer now do you wanna add something about this yeah again this is just the first step to having a cleaner more healthy lifestyle and just like healthy hands start here with bureau healthy data starts here with our machine thank you i feel like this needs to permanently live like on the floor next to the actual purell we also think we're gonna talk with it okay so you need an advocate for that yeah sign me up i'll sign the petition the easiest way is if you're oh look someone came with me is so i'm finishing setting up but uh these are my parents so we're gonna we're gonna try this out with my parents this is worth it they just got here from uh from houston texas welcome to brooklyn should we pop back and forth are you sure oh yeah yeah i'll i'll let you know when i'm putting okay great let's um vr is always hard oh there's a screen okay why don't we get a quick explanation while somebody is right is that okay can you tell us your name in a couple sentences about your project um i'm lillian uh i'm abby and um we did a vr experience that kind of explores yayoi kusama's she has a lot of installations that are based off of infinity so i wanted to kind of play with that concept in virtual reality which is a truly infinite space so we made a few different rooms that you can just explore endlessly and you can just get out whenever you want thank you for sharing all right can you tell us your name and a few sentences about your project hi my name is bo wong and i'm from stanhard and this is my project it's called the shape of evil and it's a detective horror game uh yeah so do we need any content warning or no it's okay i think we're fine this is a horror game if anybody is uh concerned maybe skip ahead one minute can you play somebody for us okay okay like you can see i'm controlling an agent now yeah and i'm investigating the accident here yeah i can find a dead woman here oh and i saw the information about this dead woman and while i'm present here queue against each different item thank you so much okay thank you thank you okay now we're ready over here all right can you do a quick introduction yourself first sure my name is nikhil kumar i'm a first year student here at itv the piece is a sound piece that is exploring a restless mind one thought at a time so when my mom starts uh she'll hear nothing initially but uh after removing each of these pieces and burying it in the dirt she'll start to hear more and more but she won't hear the entire musical composition until everything is removed and i'll just leave it at that i'm curious great okay okay left right just take a seat take your time and remove these one at a time and bury them here and that's it up well i think with 15 of them you basically never have anybody experience it the same way so they're they're hearing little bits and pieces of the entire composition as they remove things but now that she's removed everything she's going to hear the the full musical composition so it'll just run and eventually loop so people will ultimately get to the same experience but after taking everything out thank you thanks cool thanks right here tell us your name and a couple sentences about your project oh hi i'm rebecca and this is our like computer media final so this is kind of like a collective data visualization that visualizes your harvest as clocks the metaphor behind is that your clock is ticking so it's just like you're live and it's like more confidently looping and just it cracks and clocks and fades away so we want you just use your process like your heartbeat to create a unique part for you so let me show you what experience so gently put your finger tip on there so it will detect your harvest uh jump to the clock town so here you can see your unicorn there will be a unique plotting ticking sound for you and then you put your name here like my name is you will hear all kinds of so it'd be very beautiful to hear all kinds of like other people's lives like and we're very inspired by the clock installation part made by humans since 1920 98 and this is the thing thank you very much okay can we uh can you tell us your name and a few sentences about your project all right my name is ben mall i'm a first year ite student and uh i created a lighting designer stage assistant tool so you can test out your vision for a show before you so we've got a couple sliders on the screen so you can change let's say we want to make it a little more blue so you can change the amount of red here and it gets a little more purple and then we can move this light back and forth and change the shadows on the screen here yeah so you can move the shadows back and forth and uh the idea is that you'll be able to move both lights do you have a background as a lighting designer yeah i did some uh stage lighting design in college uh i studied electrical engineering but always loved theater so i always wish there was a way to test out what i was wanting to put on the stage before i got there so we're we're no longer at 721 broadway yeah yeah but we should definitely reach out and see if anybody in the design department therapy i definitely will yeah yeah great job thank you so much hi mom my dad okay tell us your name in a couple sentences about your project oh okay so my name is tiani um i also go by that my project is about using your face to play a video game um this game is called fake your smile and basically it's a game that forces you to smile in order to play the game um and then like would you like to try sure yeah okay so um it's um so you just use this camera to like um it will recognize your face and in order to start the game you have to do this gesture okay which is pop might be a little hard with the theme okay so um yeah so basically um this is how you play this game by doing this yeah and once the game starts every time i smile it will show the friendliness to the people who pass by and it takes four friendliness to actually make someone like you like oh no i missed it um but basically you have to and smile like which is not smile to regain the positive energy um so if i do this person like this person will become my friend now so that's basically how i play this game um and then just it requires the player to continue smile or not smile in order to play this game and then there's a final challenge based on how much smile you have um if you made one person like you you have to spoke your smile for 10 seconds and if you made two people like to have to smile for 20 seconds so basically the better you do at the beginning the harder it is to win the game at the end and now my challenge if i have to keep my smile otherwise the circle will start shaking and then in that case i will lose the game yay so that's basically how i win the game um and um basically um the longest for this game on that you have to hold your smile is 30 seconds yeah um tell us your introduce yourself tell us your name in a few sentences about your project okay so my name is look here okay my name is anna oh and i'm second year of itp and then recently i am studying a little bit more about the ar interfaces so this is one of my projects i'm a really love to drink wine but when i go to my store i'm not a wine expert so i'm easily lost which one i have to buy so me and my friends built this ar app which helps you your wine selection so first of all you can choose your preline preference first for example for me i like medium and i like vanilla and i like a little bit spicy taste and then you can scan your wine level yeah okay if you want to position later yeah maybe here okay so this mean is zero match with my preference so this is just okay for me this y model so what about this one this one also zero match with my preference so i might don't want to buy these two bottles so if people can find it's a happy face that means that wine bottle is perfectly matched with people's preference so yeah we are still developing in this area can you can you uh tell us your name my name is pablo and i made this joy detection mirror and it basically uses computer vision and ai to know what a smile looks like and it sees as well it lights up and you go through the infinity mirror all the way to the vortex so you guys want to try it if you get it to smile and light up you have the right to take one mnm if it doesn't light up it means that you don't have a soul so you might check that with your doctor um hey lit up i know you're smiling he's picking it thank you great job thanks guys do you have a placard oh hi i'm emily hey i'm billy and uh we worked on a web and mobile app that tries to show the relation between sound and color since they're both using frequency and the unit of hertz and other couple different pages that we can walk you through but then um here's a learn page um so the sound isn't working on this but what it's doing is um these are the color frequencies and it's showing the wavelengths associated with it and ideally it plays the pitch so on here you can see how the blue is higher than the red people can go to this site right now yes um it is el315 dot itp [Laughter] maybe wait a couple hours everybody there you go you can also send some signals so um people can collaboratively draw and once again it's supposed to play the associated page but people can just like make a little party page beautiful with colors super fun and then um billy here will demonstrate that yeah so this is reading the webcam we put it on the about page this is uh reading the webcam values across the pixelated image and it plays different midi values based on those uh based on the the pixel data basically so we're kind of mapping the colors to different musical notes here yeah thanks and i go by henry i'm a itb first year student and this is a project me and rebecca working on for pecan class and it's about how data can process through light and it's about how our daily action can be transferred and processed through like stage by stage so if users press a button about their activities and you see the visualization between like stage by stage like for example i'm pressing button about how facebook can using our data set from like collecting to exchange and to sell to other advertisement companies and how they will like analysis the data set then in the end it will become the advertisement back to us yep wonderful yeah great job thank you whoa all right so tell us your name and a few sentences about your project okay so uh my name is jan um you can try according to it and when you get close to it you can like really control it by every centimeters this is and here like the perfect pattern that i hide it's like a david's card there's no projector it's just light not just led light just like led and cinders you um can you stand together yeah so just tell us your names first and then a few sentences about the project i'm stacey yeah i am monique i'm tian so this is a live vending machine we want to raise people's surrenders of protecting animals and how the endangered animals are feeling right now yeah you want to try it can you demonstrate it yes uh so you can see how many endangered animals are killed per week right now please insert the coin and start your journey of our machine pick any animal we prefer you picked the tiger so here you can see an animation the tiger is falling to the trap they won't get out but they can't because it's already been killed here you will get a product made by the tiger it's a leather coat also you're gonna get a receipt from the more information about the tiger yeah we'll bury this so intricate and like detailed all the fabrications oh yes i want my receipts yeah sorry it's a lot of information so it'd be time to pray yeah okay thank you hey how are you i'm good okay tell us your name and a couple cents okay your project i'm zeyel i'm a first year of itp this is called thirsty plant so thirsty fun is a millennial digital pond that's only been watered by my social media account activities um so the way that it targets the issue of like how teenagers always stick for likes and followers on the internet and this outlines this point always needs water so i can demonstrate it so if someone liked my tweet it goes the waters start changing and yeah it's also the collective flight installation that i want to show people how like this water got like changed or light got changed based on time based on different people on the internet everyone can contribute to this light source eric kind of like do this yeah wonderful great job thank you what did you guys all right some of you might by the way recognize this is psy if you're a member of the coding train who's coding trade community so i'll just introduce yourself and tell us a few seconds about your project yeah so hi i'm sai i'm the coding trained community manager also first year at itp so this project is called the black projections project and basically i built what i call like a portal mapping device so it's like a map that potentially could help you unlock a portal and it kind of talks about or investigates space time and how those are all connected to a lot of different moments that are happening um and you basically explore it with the magnet you move across the points and then different images are projected on the screen how are you sensing the magnet i'm using read switches so each point each little circle has like a sensor underneath and basically when you place a magnet over it that turns on or off and then each kind of point has a collection of images that are then displayed randomly on the screen do you want to demonstrate i'm thank you okay tell us your name and a few sentences about your project hi my name is lenny and my name is by michelle so our project is called the pale blue dot and inspired by a article called yet articles called the pale blue dot by carl uh so basically uh the way he described the earth as they published uh saying the earth from the different perspective and uh i think that article is really inspiring um you never think earth as such a small and fragile thing that's tangible and because it's under our feet that we don't really recognize it so we made a tangible earth like with a really with a metaphor of the heartbeat by using the led dimming on and off to address the issue of actually our human action even though it seems to be really tiny but it's doing a lot to the earth and so on top of the earth there's some lollipop and when you take away the lollipop the earth will start to actually develop so it's actually showing that the heartbeat actually is being as not as lively as before and inside the wrap of the lollipop there's a message telling you that it's the representing the natural resource of lollipop and um but it's actually telling you that you can take away the lollipop like you don't have to feel guilty because we need to use the natural resources but it will be great if you can contribute a little back to the earth so we have like a hidden mission in this rack that you have to actually squat down to find the white box under the table and inside the box there is more lollipop that you can decide to plant one lollipop back to the blue dot so if you plan it back yeah it will become lively again thank you so much okay tell us your name and a few sentences about your projects okay i'm starting tomorrow second year and i have um like installation but it can be also simulated by a very simple method it's like like i said ultimate oil so it costs you that speaking space okay so big wave goes faster quite a small wave goes slower so it's very similar to the real world is and also i have some air to originally from there and also here but people knew that scary so run away until 99.8 percent people survive but even yeah but here also i have some another thing yeah i i just quickly assure you can we come check out your project okay tell us your names and a few sentences about what you made the name of our project is wink rocks and women and it's about penio who are basically deep su divers in jojo island but it also includes stories from mothers in mainland korea so you can listen to different stories through different objects by scanning the tag over here to the side of your headphones and what were your names my name is sue i'm katy sure oh no i don't want to put anything on there just can you talk a little bit about what he's hearing yes so these are just various stories from interviews um taken from kenyo in jeju island so it's just kind of about like the henyo have like a very ecofriendly approach to deep sea diving and collecting shellfish they make sure that they never over harvest and they have just like a collective community of like making sure that yeah they never over harvest and they collect trash but um sadly this probably is the last generation of this profession just because like younger women in jeju island are choosing not to like pursue this profession which requires just years and years of training so we just kind of want to give an homage to like the different culture that has kind of developed in jojo island where it's more like matriarchal than mainland korea um yeah that's kind of funny yeah we also wanted to kind of uh tell the story of kenya side by side with the story of a mother in seoul so more of the traditional patriarchal society and living in that society thank you thanks i'm good yeah stronger than i realized all right let's see oh boy we've been going for two hours now yeah yeah i don't know if we're gonna be able to get to everybody's project we'll do our best okay but we're here we're here for the takes okay tell us your names and a few sentences about your project my name is alvaro couture i'm nicole gernelling and our project is a object tracking installation that tracks objects to control different types of animations in real time so we have these spheres that help with all of the animations and yeah that's development after using the connect here to track the size of the spheres and the light the brightness of the spheres so we're getting a really smooth tracking of these which are being sent to the 3d particle system in unity and we're getting these realtime and they're both working today they are yeah they are all right it's time to take a nap okay uh tell us your name and if you sent us about your project hi i'm brent uh and i think work is for suckers um so i made this game about not working it's called stay in bed simulator the goal is to stay in the bed for as long as possible the game is controlled by the bed so you can watch tv in your bed you can also look at your phone in your bed and yeah that's pretty much that's pretty much the whole thing and what's the rule what's the record um the record i think right now is about 20 000 points which is roughly 15 minutes set by your very own alden rivendale jones um i have a feeling i could do very well i'm not allowed to right now thank you thank you uh tell us your name and a few sentences about your project okay i'm david and this is uh my project is about reflecting the website environments as a physical environment to create a tree that based on the website environment and makes it yeah and then generate the image that represent the environment that the user know that the website they go into are exactly like the physical environment affect you mentally and physically so yeah by showing a tree so here's the here's the website so you can go to on any website but for now we have a frozen tomatoes last airbender reviews and as you can see it's quite negative and it's a there's a red leaves and yeah and the entire background is in is like lightning and stuff so it's quite sad to see but it just shows you that you're going into a scary website right now at least a scary comments but yeah and if you look at the for example like articles from like box and stuff it take a while to load but yeah it will it'll create a tree based on the article it views it's getting the analysis and oh yeah so the the websites have a positive like a positive and the negative it's very more positive and it creates a field and it has a tree that represents all the all the words that go into the website all right tell us your name and a few words about your project okay uh my name is julia fernandez i worked on this with isabel rican she's in california um and my project is supposed to talk about the absurdity of our faces and how strange we look when our face is dissected and how recognizable we are awesome should i try it yes you should tried it yesterday this one is fun oh it has trouble with glasses and sometimes discriminates on a beard sorry but there you are what's funny is when i take my glasses off i can't see oh i don't actually know awesome okay can you tell us your name and a few sentences about it yeah i'm shinjuku and my partner is alvin he's not here he's flying on the miami beach must be nice yeah this is my project it's called evan flow and it is a kinetic light sculpture and we're doing this it's like light is always perceived as a static element in our life so we want to kind of break the boundaries and explore light in the more vivid way so we're using this to this motion kind of using this motion to recreate the tangible and natural phenomenon of app and flow so this is like going up and down and material wise we use mineral oil and this is hanging spotlights so it's kind of recreate the effects of sunlight hits if you see it from the side you may see the wavy motion hi tell us your name and a couple words about your project sure my name is aydah and this is my project it's noise it's an audio enhanced optical illusion the the visual pattern is a vortex the center shifts depending on where you're looking at it so as the viewer moves around in space it triggers also triggers the audio changes in the headphone that corresponds to the direction of the moving center of the vortex cool thank you do you want to try it oh this is the music one is just tell us your name and a few sentences about your project okay hi my name and this is my project here it's called auto vendor it's a vending machine and it's crew project with davey and lachlan so it is built like a fake vending machine we were trying to do here is to sell animations so the slogan for this is snacks and work so we thought about like on this floor aside from the snacks what else the students need when they're frustrated or hungry so do you want to give it a try sure is so these are shot using slow motion screen and this is actually one of the earliest if you want to see recording the screen right now i'm sorry so this is actually like uh recorded using a stop motion and what we're trying to do here is some of the animations are like the machine eat the food itself so we were trying to go to think about the concept of convenience right now and try to link there was laziness it's like right now like the machine instead of it gives you food it eats itself but then we show this to everybody and they think that like the asmr like sound are very joyful and the teacher suggests that or you you guys should probably make just a cute machine as those animations and we're trying to make puns on that so that it gives you encouragement when you see the message that was going to say um go through the barricade and there are also some some others like i love you very much things like that so it's kind of cute wonderful thank you thank you so much it's time for the story again yes okay tell us tell us we'll go in and maybe watch it operate but maybe just tell us your name and uh a few words about your project my name is rita and this project is in collaboration with max the silva and it's kind of a choose your own adventure poem you can sit you put your headphones and you start it by saying high sailors and then it gives you a list of questions you can ask and you hear a story that will change every time you want a demo what do yeah you can just say hi do i have to say something hi sandler's just hi sailors hi sailor who are you where are you where are you why did you leave i think it stopped yeah okay i should yeah you can try it question we cannot hear oh she's here she yes of course i knew that because i did this yesterday yeah it used to also write to the other right right there and now we just said the question thank you yeah thank you for stopping by it started working by the way yeah it's all good thank you just tell us your name and a couple sentences about your project i'm sherry so my project is orange juice squeezer and my project is a smell interaction project which has the visual sound and smell coming out wonderful it smells so good in here can you can you can you demo it for us uh yeah so you just take a fake orange and press it on the squeezer there's juice coming out and smell come from there too there's no real oranges in this room yeah except for that knife it's real okay everybody careful thank you hello hello all right uh tell us your name in a few seconds about your project um very selfexplanatory my name is tyler uh yeah i guess it's really selfish explain it i created this goal stoppers project um it's running off opposed net in p5 and basically you're using your hands to stop the ball from getting into the goal i'm a big soccer fan i enjoy soccer and i feel like something like this in the real world would be cool to help goalies maybe you know train and you know get their agility going i think it'll be pretty cool so yeah this is my project can you play it for us yeah sure if it works a little bit better everybody's a little bit out of frame honestly image good shave good job you got to watch all right tell us your name and a couple of sentences about your project uh my name is wenjing um my project is called neither square or circle it's all saying in chinese is saying that you cannot like make a circle without using ruler so it means you cannot um achieve something if you don't follow some rules so i want to explore that definition and the space between definition and ambiguity so i try to translate that into sound and visual so i want to translate between square and a circle and the visual of e will translate it into the sound wave so from a square wave to a circle more like a sine wave thing yeah so that's the basic idea behind this it's beautiful and you're just projecting uh like a rectangle moving back and forth by projecting a line a line the shape is defined by the all of these yeah okay we okay yeah so all right tell us your name and a few cents about the project i'm skylar devos this is my project i called it liquid relationships um and it's about connecting with other people yeah like how what's the best way for us to demonstrate this student is to okay and do it okay who wants to try all right i was here yesterday with like six people doing it it was crazy yeah the more people you have the more fun it is i i should not participate because i shouldn't tell you okay are the things that are aquarium pumps this is a fish tank i had as a kid really yeah that is wild it's beautiful does it matter just like a little like so it works with at least 10 people i haven't found that's amazing it's very hard to show the vr project so all right i'm excited to see this in action all right tell us your names and just couple sentences about the project hi my name is ty hi my name is ashwin and this is our project it's a twoway shadow wall where you see the shadow of yourself as well as the shadow of the person behind it and when your two shadows overlap it creates music and we have created different sections which adds different filters into the sound piece so you can make play around the entire space and yeah just have fun with it so it's a different way of communicating with each other do you guys want to try it yeah sure sure yeah why don't you two try and i'll fail it's gonna hold do you want me to hold it if you say anything about the project say it into there the channel this one's live i tried your reactions there's no projections all right here we go only about like four and a half hours in all right no no no no but it's been two hours all right tell us your names and a few sentences about your project hi i'm tina i'm chris christina and this project is called one amongst many it's a physical data visualization representing women in computing fantastic yeah all right so what should we try you want to walk around through it and yeah as you uh pick up these orbs they illuminate to full brightness and you can see every woman that we chose is a cohort with a bunch of other women so we have computer scientists mathematicians as you pick an orb up and read about a certain woman other women in her cohort will also eliminate and as the orbs are interacted with over time they get incrementally brighter so the orbs that have been read a lot will sort of like increase invisibility and you can also see other orbs that have been read a little bit less yeah their placements are based chronologically on their years of accomplishments and their heights are based on their numbers of backlinks which identifies how famous they are so the least famous ones are lower to give the audience more accessibility to the information and yeah our whole concept is to kind of like uh give more visibility to these women and inspire young people to get into the field of computing because us as creators we felt like we didn't really know we still didn't know about these women until we did this project so it was a shame but it was really awesome and yeah we want to inspire the young people here can you tell us really great things about the board over there yeah sure um so this is a sticker board and like our idea is to kind of like have a piece of the project where the audience can leave a mark of their own into our project these are the four categories that are represented within our project and we want people who have seen the project to identify themselves within one of these circles whether they're computer scientists mathematician um creative or executives activists inventors or you know like a merge of different circles so yeah it's a little fun fun thing for them to leave behind thank you good job thank you uh just introduce yourself and tell us a couple things about your night uh i'm gail i'm a first year at itp and this is gil spurling by the way uh this is the interactive scroll um so it's designed to allow someone to interact with an ancient scroll physically so you can use these rods to scroll through they have a bunch of different ancient texts here which are in hebrew and then this allows you to translate as you're reading it if you can't read the hebrew language or um the text isn't legible this is what allows you to read you can scroll a little further so yeah this was a uh pcomp um project um sort of like a basic interaction design um it would probably work well and uh should i keep going no we're good thank you yeah wow this is yours right yeah yeah give us uh tell us tell us your name and a few sentences about your project hi i'm nick um this is a project with sid chow i'm nick greg um this these are uh it's called conversation which is a duet between two hanging lamps each of these lamps emit light when bitten so the idea here is that in a dark room where this would be the only source of light that this would sort of be tools for listening so that to keep a room lit while also having a conversation you would switch off between talking and otherwise biting or producing the light and so as you look also looking at the sort of mouth as the main switch point for the interaction now are you demonstrating this or uh here so that your your teeth don't go fully out but so yeah the other one's short shorted right now but you could imagine this being a popular tool for dark room in paris cool just tell us your name in a couple sentences about your project um we'll take a look at it yeah absolutely i'm julian matthews this is the hourglass um so there is climate change related data um correlated to um the visual on the sculpture do you want to do the honors or should i do it myself i think okay yeah you got your hands busy gotcha um so this is a statistic related to bees um if the bee disappeared off the face of the earth humans would only have four years left to live um there are some static ones another static one and then these require some user input this is meant to visualize rising sea levels so you can use a slider to demonstrate that this is the approximate hue of the flint river water during peak crisis a little bit terrifying that this was coming out of people's faucets this checks the air quality of any city in the world so wouldn't you want to give me a city this is this is showing paris right now it's moderate brooklyn new york let's put in brooklyn baby we're good but then you could also put in like shanghai for example and you get a not so good value in return um yeah it's been a little bit terrifying seeing people like laugh at that all day because it's actually terrifying but um yeah and then a couple more statistic related visuals and um that's about it awesome can you speak a little bit i might not be clear to people watching live can you speak to what is what this is exactly is not actually threedimensional for sure display um here let me slide around here sorry um so these are two discs that i actually 3d printed um that once it slows down i attach neopixel strips on the outside and with this motor down here it allows me to spin it at 450 rotations per minute which gives the illusion of these two globes great job yeah thank you appreciate it all right i think maybe we're going around to the hallway yeah all right so this is our lenticular portal room okay oh can you can we both stand next to each other i'm sorry now i'm totally just interrupting no we don't want to kick everybody out oh we're the worst okay all right all right all right all right uh just tell us your names in a few seconds about the project uh so i'm aiden uh fowler i'm nicole kellequito and this is our lenticular portal room so we're doing experiments with a lenticular lens which is if you've seen bookmarks that have moving images that's what we're working with here and it stretches and magnifies the light so we're doing different experiments here we have a threedimensional box um moving lenses that are rotating and then these flat sun rises over the ocean fantastic all right we'll try to get some footage for people to see all of them now and this one's a mirror so if it's reflecting the top and bottom um yeah cool and over here we're looking at like the bending of the lenticular lens um and also looking at the lens like when it's perpendicular to a light source um it's kind of creating an infinite uh color field if you look through it um and depending on how you're looking at it you can see the the light kind of creates these like pillars um and bending throughout the shape there's nothing there's nothing the best angle for the box there's nothing in the box shall we do the reveal of like what actually is inside it's an empty box it's an empty box wow the secret is revealed but there's a thousand leds in here did you guys do it oh no i thought they were individual and like yeah and this last piece over here is a separate um it's not lenticular this is called dichroic film um and based on the angle of incidence the angle the light's hitting the material a different wavelength of light passes through or is reflected and you can change the speed with this little knob down here so you can turn it from almost a video and then kind of stop motion you just do that again it'll get up super closer yeah amazing great job thanks for coming by all right available okay great um can you both just introduce yourself briefly and tell us a few sentences about your prize oh yeah hi i'm wen i'm from taiwan hi i'm kj i'm from korea yeah so this project is called goddamn voices so this is basically a garden system that is based on word recognition so you can choose the word from the library build and save it to a microphone and see how it goes so i'm obviously going to pick rainbow yeah you can't say it again rainbow so the rainbow or town that water and the water water pump and the light i know the the cheat code revolution revolution so you're trying everything because revolution is the most powerful word for us yeah so this installation is about like the power of words because sometimes it's too it's not as invisible so people just ignore it and want to enforce emphasize that this is so strong that people should pay responsible for it and you should be aware of it great job thank you thank you thank you can you tell us about the project yeah okay yeah because then we can if then we can go inside and the idea of this project is to let people to interact what they are doing in a routine life and um let them be aware of what they're doing because normally sometimes people are like doing their things on wealthy so it's the original idea of this project and yeah so we made a box which can reflect what people are doing in their daily life so we said some of the interactions in the real side room and every connection they're doing their room will be reflected in a small box and just just so we get it can you say your name in the name of the product yeah my name is and here is the creator of this project yeah just say your name so i'll find you funny pineapple yes you can go in but it's one person at a time well do you want to just take the camera in sure okay so you can sit down i yes so okay laughs time the chair's moving let's deal down that's beautiful very cool thanks sarah pop in there if you want to leave your shoes on you can just sit on the material and hang your feet hey hey can you guys introduce yourselves and tell us a few cents about the project oh yeah yeah get in there uh my name is gilad gillard um the project is called fever dream it is i'm gonna read off the thing a uh experimental light therapy to induce the participant into a fever dream and into another person's memories so it's based off of a personal experience that i had with a fever dream and uh built into an experience where people can try to be in that fever dream yeah built it with nick gregg uh partner in crime uh it's based off of a project that i did in uh called performing reality the class and that's taught by andrew schneider and yeah the best class i took at itp it's just about to start now if you guys wanna go in there yeah so we can kind of look from the side hey you you are asleep so you are in your body in another it's really intense you are yourself don't you move ready hello oh yes we're almost done come on in this is my project partner uh okay so stand next to me okay so standing next to each other so hey guys how's it going my name is sun liu and my name is chiang kao zhang and we are uh echo of silence as you can see here um our it's working right now so um as you could see earlier when we had the door open uh we left the noise streaming in uh the sculpture stopped all activities um and now we're gonna try and be quiet for a moment and see if something happens and if i keep making noise again and making conversation with you guys it's not supposed to be doing anything and if i keep quiet again beautiful yeah the inspiration basically comes from our own background as technology students we constantly make moving and talking machines and so this time for the winter show we were thinking what if we're making a project that would discourage all activities all the talking all the noisy digital distractions out there and just take a moment to connect more and listening you know closely more to ourselves to the people around us to our environment how would that sound like and how would that feel like thank you so much thank you for stopping by okay okay thank you thanks okay okay uh tell us your name in a few senses about your project yeah sure my name is na and my project's called confession room uh the purpose of is to show solidarity with sexual assault victims in china who were censored during the meeting movement last year so um what is the process of interacting with the project would you like to try i need actually i can yeah i can just play the audio a lot i think it should be fine but i probably could do some coding do mine um i think we just get like some shots of the project um and is there a place where people can find out more about your work online yeah sure so like basically you will hear some background uh story so when you after you sit down you'll hear some background stories of the movement and then it will ask you to read this passage which is the english translation of a real victim story i think this is unplugged i think it's i think it's supposed to be right and then you were reading to you just need to repeat that message and reading that into the microphone and if you get the words right the lies will show up and if you're they're saying they can't hear you're here and if you get the words wrong you will hear some really annoying uh highpitched beeping okay yeah i'm not sure if it works without the earphones he said it's much better now yeah i had just put it away i forgot what was going on okay there you go this project reflects that you turn it up all the way to movement in china last year sexual cell victims in the country have found it difficult to build their voices out as they are going up against not just the male dominant culture but also the government censorship the following experience might cause emotional distress as the address is sexual violence if you believe that you will find experience to be traumatizing you can choose to not participate if you're willing to proceed read this paragraph out loud repeat the words if you get stuck until the words are highlighted after you're done share your thoughts with us afterwards he drove me home did you get closer afterwards he drove me home and asked me to sit in the front seat stroking my hand he said to me in the tone of an elder do not mention what happened today to anyone i was just testing your moral conduct i only take students who are not just smart but also well behaved you pass the test you must have high morals i was too scared to say anything you've come to the end of this project thank you for giving boys to these victims now take a moment to reflect on experience you can scan a qr code if you like more information about the movement that was it thank you um and everything all right can you tell us your names and a little bit about your project sure um so my name is sarah and this is helen my partner um our project is basically uh we wanted to bring our beloved childhood games from the screen and out into the real world and so this is chompy right here um he it comes from mario kart 6 from nintendo 64. because it's one of our most loved games from childhood um and he basically sleeps as long as he's left alone and he doesn't detect a lot of people in front of him but as soon as the he gets any movement or presents he'll wake up uh he's asleep right now um he'll wake up open his eyes and bark at people because he's really cranky woke him up you shouldn't really look him up um and that's about what he does all right let's wake him up let's go oh he's up now there you go his eyes are moving um he'll start barking at you soon [Laughter] great job thank you okay hi can you tell us your name and a few words about your project yeah my name is pippa kelmanson i worked on this project with noah curnis he also has a project uh we made a heart that beats the beat of your own pulse um there's a monitor on the outside and there's a motor inside a elastic part um basically you just put your index finger on the pull sensor and then you can see your pulse be unreal time i'm glad that you have these freezer bags here it's good to keep that on ice walk by transporting organs and transplants and kind of bringing human elements uh yeah it's also speaking yes what is it made out of silicon silicon great job thank you okay sort i feel like we're at the nexus of these projects this is from the class called art toy design here at itp okay okay tell us your names and a couple words about your project my name is this is our steampunk coffee machine and it's designed that people to basically get that perfect cup of coffee that you need for the day because sometimes you just don't know how much coffee you need and you answer a couple questions and it'll tell you exactly how many grams of coffee you might want that day and also the type of coffee and the machine basically gets water from here it goes up and the water comes out and you can also get the perfect measurement for your coffee abby would you like to add a few words yeah sure so if you go ahead and follow me to where little sliders are so you can answer the first question is like how how are you doing today so you got like three options from great to dead basically and it's a and then how strong you like your coffee so whether you want a subtle to a bold cup and then what kind of rose profile you prefer light medium or dark and we actually have three types of beans which are from brooklyn roasting company so based off of your response to some of those questions um or the three questions rather on the first led screen you would get a display of which type of coffee to use and how many grams and then you would weigh out the amount of coffee right on the scale so now we've basically put the coffee into this filter here and are doing moreover coverage for the coffee how many how many cups of coffee have you made do you think that's at least 20 i think yeah between the two days um i would buy i would much rather buy coffee from you on a daily all right can you oh us your name and a couple sentences about your project my name is zach lee in our project called beste which which means composition in turkish and this is basically a musical instrument that has eight different monophonic synthesizers and we also have a realtime recordable sequencer so we let me show you quickly can i show you okay currently yeah there are some recording clips so i'm gonna clear them you can clear them by double tapping the clips and how it works is basically you just turn on the metronome and then while holding down the clip you and then it will be recorded and then you can even record your knob movements in real time too and then each rows represent different patterns so you can record different patterns and then arrange them in real time so it's very suitable for live performance i would say thank you so much all right just so for a minute here everybody who's watching we're going to do these two classrooms we're going to walk downstairs and just sort of see a few projects that are on display there and say goodbye all right everybody okay we all need a break but i don't know what we're gonna do about that okay okay um tell us your name and a few sentences about the project my name is and this project is called light it's about communication with physical i love separations so much so it's just how hard you press it right yes fully in costume this is great uh tell us your name and a few sentences about your project so i'm fernando and i'm creating this character called the firebird and to embody the character in which you put on this globus and i'm imagining here a performing arts context so depending on the gestures you make you get like different a different sound and also you change the position of this 3d object on the screen and you can like change the color of the object making different gestures related to the narrative i'm creating so you can make like fire and you get a red object or you can make a tree and you get a green object and you can make like this and this is bird so you can fly you can embody the fire firebird and fly around carrying this seat that is inside the valley of the firebird beautiful thank you thank you so much thank you guys okay hey you you teleported from over there i'm abby yeah so this is fireflies you guys get closer sure sure our concentration game so do we have a participant yeah sure patrick's our volunteer so what we have here is an eeg an eeg is an electro encephalogram it's got four electrodes built in here and what it's going to do is it's going to read the electrical activity inside of his brain and he's going to be able to manipulate a javascript animation with it patrick would you like to put this on your forehead i would love to awesome it's easy to go right behind so patrick right now the fireflies are trapped in this jar do you want to start the game sure let the fireflies go just pull it right off awesome we've got our fireflies on the screen when patrick concentrates the fireflies are going to come together patrick's not concentrated the fireflies are just going to be hanging out just like this so when we start the transmission of these brown waves so we have a prompt in the middle of the screen count to five um props are different for everyone so if you want to help focus you can look at that prompt or you can focus on something specific on the screen these are all different um you can use to help focus yeah one of the first people to say this is neither precise or accurate if it doesn't come together on your first try do not worry it's really just the device you do pretty well oh yeah and we've also got some excess so let's turn around then we'll come over here all right now just tell us your name and finish yourself in a couple sentences about the project hi my name is trendy sauce and this is my project called calm it's an immersive mindfulnessbased experience where a person is wearing an eeg headset that's wirelessly connected to my phone and then my computer so they're actually controlling the visualizations as well as the lights with their mind so if somebody is in an unfocused state you can see here the lights are flickering as well as the visualizations and when they're in a more focused piece of mind the lights turn blue as well as the screen so i'm really interested in wellness and tech and how we might use tech to help ourselves instead of using tech as a form of escapism i want to use tech to kind of get more in touch with yourself so i'm doing things like this i'm i've launched a company called design life well at designlifebull.com where you can experience things like this with other artists and free online workshops that use binaural sounds nature or sounds to kind of help you get more in touch with yourself and manifest your dreams so thank you so much thank you it must be hard to get that feeling in this show he's doing a great job tell us your name and a few sentences about your project wait uh you can enter if you want yes hello my name is alizarin and this is a sacred temple of cerebral femininity an immersive environment that's aimed to let you focus on the feminine sides of your brain which is the ability to birth spread the narration idea so there are a few ways to interact with it besides just to be immersed one of them is oh smart and compassionate mirror it knows where you are and will illuminate your face with a variety of flattering light patterns for your selfies and also well when scanning this baby you will get a cosmic compliment oh you're as mystical as a planet have no doubt let your brains shimmer upon humanity um yeah and there's like a lot of machine learning used to uh generate all these visual visuals and projections and motion capture and a bunch of technology many robots help me make this as effective as it should be beautiful we've made quite a delightful corner of this classroom i i love it so much that i'm like hey why don't you even have visitors i enjoyed it yeah build it at home next is that right great job thank you so much do you want to just give us a quick spiel introduction and then we'll sort of like move around the room and catch glimpses of you if you're gonna do a performance uh yeah sure so just first introduce yourself and tell us a few things about the project uh uh my name is tober blair uh this is uh this was my final for live image processing last spring i unfortunately wasn't able to present then uh but i've got it here now um it's just it's it's there's a little diorama with sort of sliding uh pieces going that can move in and out uh and you know and uh leds that can sort of change what they look like uh you know depending on the nature of the scene and it just it's there's kind of a story that tells us about the cycle of resource consumption um and sort of how how all these three environments interact with each other and feed into each other and there's this system that kind of works beautifully together so are you going to do a performance of it sure all right so why don't we uh we'll let you get going and then we'll kind of like come back and catch pockets of it okay so so so i'll just go and go oh all right well are you starting right now is yes um okay uh just tell us your name in a few cents about your project yeah um i'm hansel lee um i made a like a very very good uh breeding uh forest so those are elements are like indicator abstract traits so by different positions making a different type of space which can give people like a move inside also the trees are part of nature as well so among the elements of nature it could be exchangeable and replaceable and collected so yeah so i would like to give people just experiencing like inside of the space how they feel it like how uh nature reacts to the human being's reading as well broken um i can do it by manual so before like actually this is my original thing um so when uh foreign it's alone it's breeding their own speed like this and then but once someone's just inside of the corridor thanks uh just tell us your name and a few sentences about your project sure so my name is vanessa and i made a levitating cube um basically how it works is that this is an electromagnet and i'm running 12 current 12 volts through it and then this is a neodymium magnet and what it does it's basically creating kind of like a pushpull dance so when i place it here this red led will turn on and that's kind of how you know that you've hit the sweet spot um and i'm also able to control the distance through this potentiometer um really finicky but very very cool you've gotten a lot of practice i can see oh my god yes before it was like so if i move it too close it'll start to go kind of crazy and it'll stick um and that's that's amazing how big do you think you could make this um like would it work at a much larger scale yeah so if i had a bigger electromagnet um it could carry a pound two pounds three pounds this can carry about an ounce more or less so like a piece of toast is its max yeah put it first next show yeah okay okay can you introduce yourself you can say a couple sentences about your project yes where do i touch you talk to here this is just extra audio lizzie chappini and sydney myers and our project's called color field and it's a interactive light display where the controller can't see what they're manipulating on the screen and the viewer can't see what the controller is doing so through communication they build a light display yeah and the kind of premise of it is we are asking people to choose a word and have a quick conversation about what colors that word evokes for them and so when they sit down at their stations either at the controller or the viewer they're trying to come together with a common goal of having the screen show the color composition of colors that they've kind of talked about to represent the work and have people been successful yeah pretty successful yeah it's really interesting to see how everybody communicates and what they're using you guys want to try definitely let me reset it okay so let's just choose optimism for you okay cool yes and what kinds of colors are evocative of the word optimism um yellow orange red um purple um yellow orange red now you're green now you're pink purple yeah yes you got it you got it perfect are we looking at that or what yeah this is great you get some footage of him just operating the controls and then these are the controls yeah so i'm not sure what's happening uh so she has to tell me what these controllers do and um i think this is like brightness on this one can we make one yellow you're just you just made it all right now it's purple okay um i don't know how to change it great job okay hey we kind of saw like all the projects see everything and look around and listen and then we will have set times i think yeah there's only one project next to the entrance that is so we're going to attempt to take the stairs and we'll see how that goes we might lose our wifi that's the other thing who knows what's going to happen wifi wise in the lobby although presumably they're all weak wow we have full troop here this is incredible look at all the construction in the stairwell uh very low or yes does it still record yeah well it will it's not recording it's straight yeah it's uploading straight okay so interfaces for musical expression so we build so we build our own musical instrument and then we perform with it um so my performance did not look like this but it's also a very physical performance and as you can hear it produces a lot of different dissident interesting chaotic sounds well thank you thank you i don't i don't know can you just tell us your name in a few sentences about the project yes mark matsumoto's uh this gentleman wants to play actually maybe get some demonstration at the same time awesome feel free to be aggressive with it so we have basically a controller and we have a synthesizer over there uh two different components so what we have going on is uh ribbon controllers or soft potentiometers on the right hand side and that's controlling your frequency underneath those soft potentiometers are fsrs force sensors um so that's going to control your amplitude so two other potentiometers are soft potentiometers that control uh dynamic and timebased effects um we have a lowpass filter with resonance and we have amplitude modulation uh reverb which is a 0100 and a global output um but no we've got a technical issue okay hold on a second um let me see like just the capture obviously disconnected that was audio much earlier yeah but i'm just trying to call on skype it's like product description oh god 30 seconds very cool man thank you so much appreciate you sweet oh thank you appreciate it sorry you can finish your sentence now we'll get oh i don't know where is that so we have effects processing on the left hand side six ribbons uh front hand side we have a few knobs um this is for actually sweeping between two different types of oscillators uh square and sawtooth i had to think about that uh three potentiometers three lap switches um each one of these coordinates with their own oscillators so in the as themselves the oscillators for the entire strip it's one octave if we actually have it held down we can go all the way up to three octaves actually hold down at the bottom and we'll go down to that single octave and as mentioned these latches these allow me to actually feed my hands to do something else like so as you see i'm playing standing up right now actually made this to sit down which i'm gonna do and i can do because they're lost so i'll get to that third oscillator we're gonna do something kind of dramatic because so it's really a struggle it's about patience actually finding where you need to be and then adjusting accordingly i've only had a few hours on this so i'm still trying to figure out actually where to play this but i've seen some other people do some interesting things on this thank you so much we built a interactive composition together it's an insulation and a piece of music at the same time can you perform it for us yes so so thank you so much great thank you uh there's one cool just introduce yourself and tell us a couple sentences then we'll go watch you before yeah i'm joe baker uh this is my performance called ronin it's about a disbanded warrior trying to relive this motions of war try to get him out of his head and this is so so um um uh so last one my name is douglas douglas gold's name here i am with midi blade and i am using the sport of the electronic sport of fencing as my influence toward um finding expression from combat toward a musical output and the human body is an interface for a musical expression so for my basic model here i'm running arduino nano through bluetooth ble and i have it set up so that the pitch and the roll the roll changes my notes for the rotation of my wrist and then sure so i'm gonna turn you up now like if we do and now let's try doing the same thing is and every time you play you'll have a new generative composition as the output so i'm excited to keep developing it thank you very much i don't know i don't know how many projects that was 128. knows exactly how many of us just give a big thank you to everybody who's been helping with this
