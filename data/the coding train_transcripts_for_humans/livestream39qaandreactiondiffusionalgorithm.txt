With timestamps:

00:00 - good morning hello good afternoon good
00:03 - evening good middle of the night I don't
00:05 - know where you are I don't know where I
00:06 - actually I do know where I am my glasses
00:08 - are very dirty I am now uh uh I
00:10 - attempting something that I've never
00:12 - attempted before and I will say a little
00:13 - bit in a minute about maybe who I am and
00:15 - what I'm doing here but I'm currently I
00:17 - turned on a live stream to three
00:20 - different outputs
00:23 - YouTube twitch and Facebook Facebook now
00:26 - has live streaming I'm not so sure this
00:28 - is such a good idea but I don't know
00:30 - what's currently working so I'm going to
00:32 - uh take a look at my laptop over here
00:35 - and I'm going to check the most
00:37 - important one is really the YouTube one
00:38 - which ah does seem to be working oops
00:41 - and I'm um uh which is good because
00:44 - that's the one that was giving me the
00:45 - most trouble before so people on YouTube
00:48 - people of YouTube people of Earth
00:51 - YouTube or alien YouTube if you're
00:53 - watching this in the distant future or
00:55 - the not so distant future in the alien
00:57 - YouTube thing in the archive robot let
01:00 - takeover time thing anyway uh let me
01:02 - know how the sound quality is uh is the
01:05 - picture quality okay I also have this
01:07 - whiteboard is this over here I need to I
01:09 - didn't actually Focus the camera I'm out
01:11 - of sorts I was in another foreign
01:13 - country on the other side of the world
01:14 - for a while but I'm back and I'm ready
01:17 - here I've got six straight weeks of
01:19 - doing this uh I see people on YouTube
01:22 - are saying things seem to be working I'm
01:25 - not g to I'm gonna open up Twitch just
01:26 - so I have it here too uh twitch uh and
01:30 - then I'm going to Facebook am I
01:32 - streaming to Facebook I don't know how
01:34 - to I don't know how to
01:35 - tell uh maybe if I go to my profile page
01:39 - I can see if I am oh look I am look at
01:42 - that uh Facebook streaming is a great
01:46 - idea okay there I am I'm on I'm I'm on
01:50 - Mom Dad I'm on
01:52 - Facebook is that a thing um so okay so
01:56 - let me give a quick introduction for
01:57 - anybody who's watching uh about what's
01:59 - going to happen here it's very warm in
02:01 - here today I'm going to have to I have a
02:03 - t-shirt on underneath I might have to
02:05 - remove the outer layer I'm starting to
02:06 - feel a little the
02:07 - clamped um okay so my name is Dan uh
02:10 - schiffman I am a person who lives in New
02:14 - York City uh I uh work on a lot of
02:16 - different things uh namely a couple
02:18 - things I work on are something called
02:19 - processing and something called p5js
02:21 - those are programming environments I uh
02:24 - sometimes be on the internet to uh do
02:27 - lessons and tutorials and things about
02:29 - programming so that's where I am right
02:31 - now and I I haven't actually I'm doing
02:33 - this weekly I haven't done this in a
02:34 - couple weeks cuz I was away um in China
02:37 - lovely country pollution was not so
02:39 - great but otherwise I had an amazing
02:41 - time uh I would love to say more about
02:44 - that but I think I should move on um uh
02:47 - YouTube is not available in China I met
02:49 - with some folks who are suggesting maybe
02:51 - I upload some of my content to yuku I
02:53 - might do some subtitles that's another
02:54 - story for another time I'm here today uh
02:57 - trying to get back my head back into
02:58 - things uh
03:00 - and figure out what to do today so the
03:02 - first the thing I'm going to start with
03:05 - uh is that I'm currently running an
03:06 - online course with a company called
03:08 - Caden uh and um I'm going to look at the
03:12 - Forum post there have been some
03:14 - questions there with some interesting
03:15 - topics and I will answer those questions
03:17 - and do a few programming examples mostly
03:19 - about uh physics simulation and forces
03:22 - uh and then I'm going to go to my list
03:24 - of topics and try to pick something else
03:27 - uh to kind of do as a tutorial today as
03:29 - well well and in the future I will have
03:31 - these much more planned but I literally
03:33 - had like 20 minutes to get this set up
03:35 - and it's working uh and there it is so I
03:38 - I've like I've desperately is this is
03:40 - like social media addiction which I like
03:42 - desperately want to like look and see
03:44 - what's going on but I so those of you
03:46 - who are watching online I don't know if
03:48 - there is a Facebook Chat where you can
03:51 - ask questions or but uh the chat that I
03:54 - typically look at is YouTube so somebody
03:57 - you can you can find my YouTube channel
03:58 - I'm sure uh okay uh so I'm going to the
04:01 - YouTube channel I'm going to check the
04:04 - comments uh and leave Facebook alone it
04:08 - is evil agreed look I'm just here trying
04:10 - to reach as many people as possible and
04:13 - you know we'll see what
04:15 - happens uh okay so everything is working
04:18 - everybody's saying things are working
04:19 - that's wonderful I am not on the live
04:21 - dashboard I need to switch to a
04:22 - different page give me a second oh I
04:24 - have that over here closing this opening
04:26 - this do you like my n oh 42 wow this is
04:29 - like I've never had so many people
04:30 - watching at once this is very exciting
04:32 - and this is my least prepared day for
04:34 - this so this is terrible okay so the
04:36 - first thing I'm going to do is um uh uh
04:39 - okay so one thing I'll mention is so
04:41 - this is you're watching the current live
04:44 - stream I like how Google thinks I'm in
04:46 - Hong Kong it's gone now it knows I'm in
04:47 - New York uh so this live stream is me
04:50 - just talking and operating some
04:52 - computers but what I will do oh and I
04:54 - have to hit record uh I'm GNA hit record
04:57 - so now I am recording this live stream
04:59 - disc because what will happen later is
05:02 - if there are if it so happens that there
05:04 - are some nuggets of wisdom or some uh
05:07 - short 10-minute spots that are useful
05:09 - tutorials I will edit those separately
05:11 - as videos and upload to Youtube um a
05:15 - couple just administrative things I want
05:17 - to talk about so I've been doing some
05:19 - traveling my traveling is done until
05:21 - July 4th so I'm going to be doing this
05:24 - every week for six weeks straight I'm
05:26 - hoping to do two sessions per week 100%
05:29 - I'm going to well 100% I'm definitely
05:30 - going to do one but I would like to do
05:32 - two sessions per week I have a slight
05:34 - problem which is that on June 8th I've
05:36 - been called for jury duty which arguably
05:38 - is actually quite a convenient time for
05:39 - me to do it because I have kind of
05:40 - nothing else going on semester is over
05:43 - summer this is my thing now um but so uh
05:46 - June 8th which is a Wednesday I I have
05:48 - jury duty so I'll be out for a few days
05:50 - doing that or longer depending on what
05:52 - what happens with that the other thing
05:54 - I'll mention is that I am going to start
05:56 - a patreon uh so if you're interested in
05:59 - that uh there'll be more information
06:01 - about that in some various form now if
06:03 - you want to get email announcements I'll
06:05 - just mention really briefly this is the
06:08 - last sort of admin thing I'll do if you
06:09 - go to uh shiffman domnet which is my uh
06:12 - website and up in the corner here there
06:15 - is a place where you can put in your
06:16 - email hit get updates usually what I
06:19 - typically right I'm trying to establish
06:20 - a regular schedule I've been saying that
06:21 - for like three months and I have not
06:23 - managed to do so but um I have been uh
06:27 - at some point I will but what I've been
06:29 - doing is it's essentially like the night
06:30 - before or two days before sending an
06:32 - email saying this Tuesday 11:00 a.m.
06:35 - eastern standard time will be the live
06:36 - stream which is today Tuesday at 11:00
06:38 - a.m. so you can sign up to get those
06:40 - otherwise Twitter yada yada yada y 63
06:43 - people are watching this is like we're
06:44 - approaching a
06:45 - record one of these days I'm going to
06:47 - get to 100 uh plus 38 and I don't I
06:50 - don't know if I can count the Facebook
06:53 - yet and uh uh it should always be
06:55 - referred to as the Facebook maybe that
06:57 - makes it less evil I'm not sure this
06:59 - it's all evil right I mean or it's not I
07:01 - mean what's what's evil what's not evil
07:03 - it's all evil hopefully I'm not evil uh
07:05 - the website again is shiffman
07:07 - Donnet uh okay so I'm just poking around
07:10 - here to see uh what's going on I see
07:13 - that I'm on Twitch I'm on YouTube
07:15 - Facebook has 47 viewers this is insane
07:19 - but I I guess Facebook has like an
07:20 - audience there uh all right uh okay I'm
07:23 - awkwardly ah I feel like terrified now
07:26 - somebody somebody magically tell me it's
07:28 - going to be okay uh uh um you are a lens
07:31 - but a person behind the lens okay so let
07:34 - me start by going to I'm going to do
07:36 - some Quest Q&A so I'm gonna go I'm
07:38 - running this thing now I'm running this
07:41 - uh course with Caden you know me
07:44 - personally just to give you a quick
07:45 - point of view I much prefer now over the
07:49 - past number of years of doing this kind
07:50 - of stuff I prefer to do self-publishing
07:53 - I prefer to just sort of have my own
07:54 - YouTube channel make videos kind of
07:56 - independently try to have stuff be open
07:58 - and available for free
08:00 - experiment with different Revenue models
08:01 - whether crowdsourcing whether
08:03 - advertising or none whether just sort of
08:05 - being paid by a university and sort will
08:07 - have them let me do this but I did do an
08:10 - exper and I I had sort of a negative
08:12 - experience with the learning processing
08:13 - book which I could talk about on a uh
08:15 - which was done with a publishing company
08:17 - but I did decide to do a course with
08:20 - this company um as an experiment um
08:23 - there's some great people who worked for
08:24 - this company uh it was interesting to do
08:26 - sort of a collaboration I kind of do
08:27 - these videos on my own but there were
08:29 - various people to collaborate with to
08:31 - help with sort of scripting and editing
08:32 - and all that sort of stuff so anyway U
08:35 - that's that's um what's happening there
08:36 - so this course is running you can see
08:38 - all the videos for free and you can pay
08:41 - some amount of money to I don't know
08:42 - submit assignments and that sort of
08:43 - thing so what I would like to do is log
08:45 - in
08:48 - uh uh by the way I love that there's an
08:50 - email that pops up in my autofill that
08:53 - says daniel. shman plus unicorn like
08:55 - when did I I I was like every once in a
08:57 - while I need like an extra email address
08:58 - and at one point I must have typed in
09:00 - plus unicorn that's pretty great uh okay
09:03 - but my email for Caden is definitely
09:05 - this and I have no idea what my password
09:08 - [Music]
09:10 - is I totally spelled that
09:14 - wrong let's see if that works oh it's
09:16 - totally the wrong password okay I'm
09:17 - gonna look it up over here I have a
09:19 - separate computer I use uh I'm not GNA
09:23 - plug some password organization tool I'm
09:26 - going to look it up here kadenz uh
09:30 - and my password is uh oh my God it is an
09:35 - impossible to remember password good job
09:39 - being with my security okay this is
09:40 - going to be insane I'm going to read you
09:42 - some of the letters capital
09:44 - y0
09:46 - z- capital
09:48 - V uh n parentheses capital r capital Y
09:52 - lowercase r n parentheses capital m
09:55 - capital I and then three more things
09:58 - great now my password with knowing all
10:00 - of that log
10:02 - in oh come on oh
10:05 - invalid this is
10:09 - okay deck failure o pause pause time do
10:13 - I have that superpower yet no I don't
10:16 - it's a live stream so I can't pause time
10:18 - I must I either typed it in wrong or
10:21 - okay I'm just gonna here's what I'm
10:22 - gonna do right now I'm going to just
10:24 - look at it over on this computer because
10:26 - I just want to look at the questions uh
10:28 - and you know what may maybe it's better
10:30 - this way anyway um because I don't maybe
10:34 - people don't want their uh names if they
10:36 - did a forum post showing up on this live
10:38 - stream so now I'm going to do login
10:42 - uh come on you can do
10:48 - it this is must be riveting for those of
10:50 - you watching maybe I could get a
10:52 - Chewbacca mask and wear it and that
10:54 - would help
10:56 - um uh I'm typ in my email and typing in
11:00 - my password okay I must oh yeah it
11:04 - worked okay so I I was not able to
11:06 - transfer it correctly so I'm logged in
11:08 - now I'm going to go to the forums you
11:11 - can't see this but and I will read to
11:12 - you the questions I'm also going to
11:14 - check the chat
11:17 - um uh okay I
11:21 - am uh I am now in the
11:25 - core uh now I'm in the forums and I'm
11:28 - going to start looking at some questions
11:29 - a lot of questions there so hello now I
11:30 - need to check the YouTube chat because
11:32 - you can also if you're on YouTube do
11:34 - live questions if you're on the Facebook
11:36 - remember it is pronounced the Facebook
11:38 - one word I think right
11:41 - um uh uh um I I I don't know how to I
11:46 - don't know how to see I don't understand
11:47 - this Facebook thing maybe I should use
11:49 - Snapchat I should like Snapchat this is
11:52 - that how you do it I think that's how
11:54 - you do it I read an article that said
11:56 - Snapchat for old people how to
11:58 - understand it and it it sort of made
12:00 - sense to
12:02 - me um okay uh where am I YouTube I'm
12:05 - looking for YouTube I'm also on Twitch
12:08 - um okay oh a yes I'm definitely at some
12:10 - point gonna get a 360 camera in here
12:12 - because why not I mean come on okay I
12:15 - don't see any questions so far on
12:17 - YouTube I do see that there are 73
12:18 - people watching which is kind of
12:19 - shocking to me well I I have a very I do
12:22 - very I like I've done several things in
12:24 - the past like
12:25 - completely have computers freeze and
12:27 - things which tends to send people away
12:29 - so I'm going to go to the forums now and
12:31 - I'm going to uh wow there's a lot of
12:35 - questions um and I'm actually going to
12:37 - start with a question that comes
12:40 - from uh
12:42 - Alex um and the question is um I feel
12:46 - like I want to speak directly to you
12:49 - this is very bad what I'm about to do
12:53 - here this way I could look at you while
12:55 - I'm reading I'm attempting to create a
12:57 - moderately functional Sid R ER using
12:59 - different forces and whatnot but the
13:01 - acceleration of my object seems
13:02 - immediate and abrupt going from zero uh
13:05 - zero to acceleration to an immediate
13:06 - constant acceleration yada yada yada etc
13:09 - etc I'm looking for advice how to
13:12 - simulate gravity so that jumping can be
13:14 - implemented such as when a user presses
13:16 - a key to jump a force is exerted
13:18 - displaying that jump okay I think I get
13:20 - this question this is a great
13:21 - programming problem I think we could
13:22 - spend some time working it out for those
13:24 - of you who might be interested and if
13:26 - both of you are not interested you can
13:29 - just turn this off I recommend probably
13:31 - that you turn it off um I have some uh
13:34 - tea here I will take a sip of that for a
13:35 - second I oh I I I'm not supposed to talk
13:37 - about drinking the tea because the last
13:39 - time I did that somebody on YouTube was
13:41 - very angry at me and wrote lots of
13:43 - comments about okay so let's talk about
13:45 - what I think we're going to program here
13:46 - to answer this first question so let's
13:48 - imagine uh this is your
13:51 - canvas and um you have this sort of like
13:55 - scene where you have this uh stick
13:57 - figure and the stick figure is is moving
13:59 - across like a platform this is some
14:01 - standard kind of game I think right
14:02 - somebody can post in the chat plat not a
14:05 - platform game it's like a sidescroller
14:06 - maybe that's what it's called and so
14:08 - this uh person is moving this way and
14:10 - maybe there are like different obstacles
14:13 - and what you want is for this person
14:15 - this character to be able to jump over
14:17 - those obstacles not too dissimilar from
14:19 - like Flappy Bird also right we Flappy
14:21 - Bird there's like I just wanted to see
14:23 - if I could draw a
14:27 - bird let's see my alien bird oh look
14:30 - with some weird crazy dragon wings or
14:32 - something I don't know I I I lost I got
14:34 - lost in my own fantasy imagination there
14:36 - for a second sorry so um so you can
14:39 - imagine this bird flying this way and
14:40 - you press a key and it pushes a force
14:42 - pushing up so one of the things actually
14:44 - in most of my examples and even if you
14:45 - go back and watch all my nature of code
14:47 - videos that are on YouTube or the videos
14:48 - that are for this Caden course generally
14:51 - you'll see that I have these forces
14:52 - being applied continuously like gravity
14:54 - is always there or an object is always
14:56 - seeking a Target so I think this is an
14:58 - interesting thing to to discuss what
14:59 - about a kind of instantaneous Force for
15:02 - example I'm just standing here and
15:04 - suddenly this great force just
15:06 - instantaneously pushes me up from the
15:08 - bottom and I jump so um how would you
15:10 - simulate that and of course like a key
15:12 - press or a mouse click could do
15:13 - something like that so the other thing
15:15 - that I think is interesting about this
15:16 - problem is that um you know what what's
15:21 - moving right this in the in the world
15:25 - right if I move this way I move this way
15:28 - right I'm right here's this pen and I'm
15:30 - moving oh no I can't do it I'm moving
15:33 - towards the pen but what's not to say
15:36 - that the uh I can't do this optical
15:38 - illusion the pen moving am I moving or
15:39 - is the pen moving you can see because
15:41 - the back the point is that was a
15:43 - terrible demonstration the point is what
15:45 - hap what if I want the background to
15:47 - move I want it to appear that this
15:48 - person is moving but they're actually in
15:50 - the canvas staying in the same place so
15:52 - that's kind of an interesting question
15:53 - as well so let's uh I I guess um let's
15:56 - go see if we can let me come back here
15:58 - and I I see green bars which means audio
16:00 - is still working um checking the chat um
16:05 - uh okay there's some weird things going
16:08 - on in the chat which I will ignore um so
16:10 - let's see let's figure out where we're
16:11 - going to program this so um one thing I
16:14 - should do I think is let's not start
16:17 - from scratch so what I'm going to do is
16:20 - I'm going to go to uh
16:23 - GitHub um and uh I have a lot of code in
16:27 - a lot of places I don't know what that
16:29 - means that sounds a little weird uh and
16:31 - I want to go to uh
16:34 - repositories and I'm going to look at
16:35 - this one for right now so um I have a
16:38 - lot of different nature of code
16:39 - repositories for various simulation and
16:42 - physics examples this has some code that
16:44 - goes specifically with that particular
16:46 - online course so I'm just going to start
16:47 - from there uh and I'm going to uh just
16:51 - download it as a zip um if you're
16:54 - wondering about git and GitHub for only
16:56 - 0 and0 you could watch my GitHub
17:00 - tutorials is it popping up here no
17:03 - because it doesn't do
17:04 - that but I do have some get GitHub
17:06 - tutorials they are free you have to
17:08 - watch some ads I might turn off the ads
17:09 - I don't know what to do about the ads
17:11 - okay so I think I downloaded that and uh
17:14 - what I'm going to do is show in finder
17:16 - I'm going to open up this folder and uh
17:20 - session one session two um let's put
17:22 - this folder on the desktop just for
17:24 - right now uh over here and let's find an
17:27 - example to start with
17:29 - uh session
17:33 - two three examples which to begin with
17:36 - let's do the particles array
17:39 - one uh and I'm going to but what we're
17:42 - doing is actually quite different than
17:43 - these examples so I'm going to use this
17:45 - P5 editor even though I haven't actually
17:47 - been using it recently in these video
17:50 - tutorials I've been using adom or
17:53 - Sublime uh okay but let's just let's
17:55 - look at what this example is doing
17:59 - click it says here click to add
18:01 - particles so okay so you can see what
18:03 - this this is how my examples typically
18:05 - look right my examples typically look
18:08 - like okay there's a bunch of things in
18:09 - the screen and there are various forces
18:12 - one force is gravity another force is
18:13 - wind so I think when I click the mouse
18:15 - you can see that there's this wind Force
18:17 - suddenly being applied so in that sense
18:20 - a force is being applied one force is
18:23 - being applied continuously the Gravity
18:25 - Force another force is being applied
18:26 - only when the mouse is held down
18:29 - but neither of those are just like a
18:30 - single one-time Force but let's at least
18:32 - look at where in the code that's
18:33 - happening and then I'm going to
18:35 - completely restructure this example to
18:37 - um do this platform thing okay so uh
18:42 - here uh here in the sketch we can see
18:45 - this happening here so um there there
18:49 - are these particle objects and the
18:51 - particle objects are in a particle's
18:52 - array and an apply Force function is
18:55 - being called on each of those apply
18:57 - Force gravity is always being called
19:00 - apply force wind is only being called if
19:02 - the mouse is pressed basic structure for
19:04 - an
19:05 - example and uh now if I go to the
19:07 - particle object here is the key thing
19:09 - that I want to show you this is the
19:12 - apply Force function so I you know I I
19:14 - don't know who's watching this or where
19:16 - you're from or why you're here or if
19:18 - you've already left or what but just to
19:20 - mention briefly these examples are built
19:23 - on Newton's second law of motion which
19:25 - is stated as Force equals mass time ACC
19:28 - acceleration the definition of a force
19:31 - is a vector a thing that causes an
19:33 - object with mass to accelerate so if I
19:35 - push something with a force that object
19:37 - it has a mass it's going to accelerate
19:39 - so that's written this way Force equals
19:42 - mass time acceleration it can also be
19:43 - written as acceleration equals force
19:46 - divided by mass so if I go back over
19:49 - here to the code you'll see that's
19:50 - exactly what's Happening Here the apply
19:52 - Force function receives a force variable
19:54 - it divides it by mass and it adds it to
19:56 - the object's acceleration now there's a
19:58 - lot more to say about that and so if you
20:00 - want to kind of go back and what's a
20:02 - vector and how did it get all the way to
20:03 - this point then you could go and watch
20:05 - either my uh it's just like a walking
20:08 - advertisement for myself which is kind
20:09 - of weird but uh you can watch the nature
20:12 - of code videos that I have on YouTube or
20:14 - uh you better yet you might just go and
20:15 - watch the videos that are with on the
20:17 - Caden website for this particular course
20:19 - okay um uh oh did somebody said yeah I
20:23 - can't hear any some
20:25 - something okay stop time out I need to
20:29 - know if people can hear audio before I
20:32 - keep
20:33 - going so I'm going to
20:36 - clap I'm gonna do the Hand
20:40 - Jive can you hear that I hear sound I
20:44 - hear sound I hear sound yes okay people
20:47 - are saying they hear sound I I can't I
20:49 - can't look at the Facebook I'm afraid of
20:51 - it so the Facebook is happening if you
20:54 - want if you're on watching on Facebook
20:55 - and you want to interact with me you're
20:56 - going to have to go to the YouTube chat
20:58 - I can only look at one chat okay great
20:59 - everything's working fine um okay so
21:04 - where are we okay so now I need to
21:05 - completely restructure this example
21:08 - because if you're still with me what I'm
21:09 - trying to build is this let's make a
21:12 - game why not let's make a game where
21:14 - you're a little person or a big person
21:16 - or or an alien or whatever it is and
21:19 - you're running and obstacles are there
21:21 - and you have to jump over them I think
21:22 - we could do that I I got time I don't
21:24 - have anywhere to go I mean I have to eat
21:25 - lunch at some point I mean I don't have
21:27 - to I could skip lunch salad would be
21:31 - nice okay um so here we go so I've got a
21:35 - I don't know if it was so great to start
21:36 - with this particular example because
21:37 - it's got a lot of extra stuff in it but
21:39 - I'm going to do uh I'm going to do save
21:41 - as and I'm gonna um just put this on the
21:44 - desktop right now and I'm going to call
21:45 - this the running game is that a thing
21:48 - running game I don't know what that is I
21:49 - hope that's not something like weird
21:51 - that I just called it okay um so what I
21:54 - want to do here is now have a um
21:58 - uh
22:00 - person and I'm going to say uh I'm going
22:03 - to just say the person uh forget about
22:05 - this mouse press thing ah ah oh how's
22:10 - this font size I feel like this font
22:11 - size needs to be a little bit bigger
22:15 - uh that looks good I think you can read
22:18 - that let me know if the font size is
22:20 - okay uh wow I've never this is
22:23 - definitely a record that there are 80
22:24 - people watching this on YouTube right
22:25 - now which is kind of a little terrifying
22:27 - okay the person
22:29 - is a new
22:31 - particle and oh I have this like I have
22:34 - so many things that I want to do in
22:35 - these videos I let's see how much time
22:37 - we have today it's 11:30 I got at least
22:39 - till 1 o'clock 1 pm um then I will be
22:42 - attending there is an exhibition at ITP
22:44 - of um experimental storytelling things
22:47 - anybody wants to stop by and say hi uh
22:49 - okay it's a little hot in here um okay
22:51 - so now what I want to do is I'm just
22:53 - going to say let's um I'm going to
22:57 - simplify some things this particle
22:58 - object is going to be my person and I am
23:02 - going to take out this idea of mass
23:04 - because that will make things a little
23:06 - bit
23:07 - simpler and I am going to and I will
23:11 - review all the pieces of this code once
23:14 - uh I'm going to say uh once things are
23:16 - kind of going I'm going to say person.
23:19 - update person do is it show or display
23:22 - let's see what's the name of that
23:23 - function display person. display and um
23:28 - let's just see and uh the particle and
23:31 - let's just rename this the
23:33 - person uh and uh and I'm gonna say new
23:37 - whoops I'm gonna say then new person uh
23:41 - okay and let's see so what do I have now
23:43 - if I run this good I don't see any
23:45 - errors uh let's oh no uh and then I'm
23:49 - going to go here I'm going to just get
23:51 - rid of this click to add particles from
23:52 - the HTML file and run this okay uh
23:57 - that's strange didn't I delete that did
23:59 - I not save it there we go okay there we
24:03 - go okay so now I've got my empty canvas
24:05 - now okay so what I want this
24:07 - person let's just make the person a
24:09 - rectangle you will do this someday on
24:11 - your own and make this more interesting
24:12 - and
24:14 - actually I'm going to uh just simplify
24:16 - things and get rid of these arguments
24:18 - and say the person is going to be at
24:21 - pixel uh 50 and the location will be at
24:25 - Y is um
24:28 - uh height so I'm gonna draw this person
24:31 - this is I'm everything is always so
24:33 - tricky I'm gonna draw this person I want
24:35 - to draw this person just as a
24:37 - rectangle kind of sitting on the bottom
24:39 - of the screen uh so let's see so the
24:43 - location is am I back here yet no the
24:46 - location is the bottom of the screen so
24:47 - now I want to in the display function I
24:50 - want to make this a
24:53 - rectangle uh so a rectangle at this do X
24:57 - and Y is the height but let's say a
25:00 - height let's say the the person is 50
25:02 - pixels tall so this doy minus 50 like 20
25:06 - pixels wide and 50 pixels high and those
25:08 - should be variables but let's just see
25:10 - if at the very least we have I don't see
25:11 - the person yet so what's what's
25:14 - missing um let's uh let's let's get rid
25:18 - of um update for a second I still don't
25:21 - see the person uh let's see let's uh oh
25:26 - thisp is the the name of the variable
25:30 - it's a vector object not individual x's
25:32 - and y's of course there we go so now
25:35 - we're getting somewhere yay we have a
25:38 - little uh Square there at the bottom and
25:41 - I want that person to move so let's put
25:45 - um uh let's put sorry let's put uh
25:48 - update back in okay so I I I'm at a
25:51 - point now where I can take a moment to
25:53 - breathe and kind of I just had to
25:55 - restructure that example I it probably
25:57 - would have honestly been easier me just
25:58 - programm this from scratch but that's
26:00 - the example we had so the person has is
26:03 - an object with an update and a display
26:05 - function let's look at what it means to
26:07 - be this person the person has a position
26:10 - which is where that person is on the
26:12 - screen a velocity meaning its current
26:14 - change in position and acceleration
26:16 - which is the thing that's going to be
26:18 - How does its velocity change which is uh
26:20 - uh uh Changed by a force so let just to
26:23 - get a sort of experiment going here what
26:25 - if I were to say uh in the what the
26:29 - person's velocity instead of being Z 0
26:32 - was is 1 comma 0 so now if I were to run
26:36 - this again we can see there's the person
26:38 - moving so we can see that velocity this
26:40 - velocity Vector controls um the person's
26:43 - movement now interestingly enough let's
26:46 - place an obstacle in the scene I want to
26:48 - kind of tackle this weird uh view Port
26:51 - question problem first before I get any
26:54 - too far into this so let's let's place
26:58 - an obstacle on the scene and I'm going
26:59 - to just say obstacle equals uh I'm going
27:02 - to say I'm going to make a variable
27:04 - called obstacle and I'm going to say
27:05 - obstacle equals create Vector um uh and
27:10 - you know what I'm just going to have the
27:12 - yeah
27:13 - um there's so many different ways I
27:15 - could do this um I'm gonna say um you
27:18 - know what I'm going to do I'm uh we're
27:20 - gonna I think we're going to want an
27:21 - obstacle object so for right now I'm
27:23 - going to do something totally silly
27:25 - which is just hard code something in so
27:27 - I'm going to make this nice uh some sort
27:29 - of purplish pinkish color and I'm going
27:31 - to say rectangle where this window is
27:33 - 640 pixels wide so let's stick it at 400
27:36 - pixels uh make it uh uh 50 pixels wide
27:41 - and uh uh 50 pixels High uh so I'm doing
27:45 - the same sort of thing here
27:48 - um like this uh oh No 3 ah so this would
27:54 - be height minus 50 okay so I'm just
27:56 - trying to draw a another rectangle that
27:57 - sits at the Bott bottom and so what I
28:00 - want is the idea here for this example
28:02 - is as this thing is moving I want to
28:05 - press the space bar and have it jump
28:06 - over that obstacle this is what we're
28:08 - going for you guys still with me oh 94
28:10 - people my my head is exploding oh my God
28:13 - this is totally insane this is not very
28:15 - good what am I gonna do okay uh it'll
28:17 - get better maybe or not okay so okay so
28:19 - here's the
28:20 - thing right now we see the person moving
28:24 - towards the obstacle what if I don't
28:26 - because the person has a forward
28:28 - velocity so I want to keep my physics
28:30 - kind of true to form with that forward
28:32 - velocity but what if I want to see the
28:33 - person in place and the obstacle moving
28:35 - instead well interestingly
28:38 - enough I think you know I'm kind of
28:40 - honestly I'm not really like a game
28:42 - programmer and there might there
28:43 - probably some very standard ways of
28:45 - doing these things and that I might be
28:46 - missing here but I might also just be
28:48 - coming up with these sort of things on
28:49 - the fly in the exactly the same way but
28:51 - the way that I would approach this would
28:53 - be rather than setting the velocity of
28:55 - this to zero and have giving this a
28:57 - velocity what I might do is just move
29:01 - almost our view of the scene always to
29:04 - be centered on this particular character
29:07 - and the way I can do that is with
29:09 - translate so the translate function I'm
29:11 - going to write this down the translate
29:13 - function and this is a kind of function
29:15 - that exists across most computer
29:17 - Graphics environments any type of opengl
29:19 - programming environment processing P5
29:22 - open
29:23 - Frameworks probably like three jzz I
29:25 - don't know who knows they have their own
29:27 - way of day they with 3js 3js it whatever
29:30 - it has its own way of doing things um so
29:33 - I don't know what I'm talking about and
29:34 - this camera just went off because
29:35 - apparently I've been talking for a half
29:36 - an hour that's how I keep time this
29:37 - one's going to go off in a second there
29:39 - see now I'm turning it back on um okay
29:42 - so what translate allows you to do is
29:45 - move the point of
29:47 - origin so the point of origin by default
29:49 - in a canvas in the browser is the top
29:52 - left corner that is 0 0 so this
29:55 - character is drawn relative to 0
29:58 - but what if I sort of think of instead
30:01 - of drawing the character relative to 00
30:04 - but I always position the origin
30:07 - relative to where the character
30:08 - is so in other words if the character
30:11 - moves over here then I just want to move
30:13 - the origin kind of over here as well so
30:15 - that I always see so that I always see
30:19 - the character sort of staying in place
30:21 - now I I know that might not have been
30:23 - the most succinct or sensical way of
30:26 - explaining that but hopefully that made
30:28 - some sense to you um and uh oh my God I
30:31 - think I might actually hit the 100
30:32 - people today um and so what I think I
30:35 - can do here is right here I can add a
30:39 - trans so let me just show you what I
30:40 - mean by this what if I were to just say
30:43 - translate 100 Zer so I move the
30:46 - origin negative 100 pixels to the left
30:49 - what does this do to our scene well
30:51 - everything is shifted over you can see
30:53 - how right let me do that again
30:56 - so um and I'm going to make this a
30:58 - variable I'm going to do something crazy
31:00 - uh yeah I'm going to show you some wacky
31:02 - JavaScript debugging craziness because I
31:04 - just I'm feeling like this is whatever
31:07 - today I'm just I'm warming back up to
31:08 - doing this on a weekly basis I answered
31:10 - one question for about a half an hour
31:12 - I'll probably be answering this question
31:13 - for another hour but I will go through
31:14 - the other questions uh I'm getting a lot
31:17 - of friend requests all of a sudden on
31:19 - Facebook okay I can't look at my phone
31:21 - during this thing okay um it's terrible
31:23 - unless unless
31:25 - I'm that's the universal symbol for
31:28 - Snapchatting I don't I really don't know
31:29 - what Snapchat is it's very
31:31 - embarrassing it's because I have gray
31:33 - hair okay uh x equals um x equals uh
31:37 - zero so I'm just going to put a
31:39 - translate here and what I'm going to do
31:42 - is I'm going to run this and I'm going
31:44 - to go to this little gear icon here so
31:46 - that I have a nice little JavaScript
31:48 - console and right now if I say x equals
31:50 - 00 you can see how I'm shifting things
31:54 - over right so I I'm a I'm live updating
31:57 - that of x to kind of move where that
31:59 - origin is to move my view of the scene
32:01 - like I need to move the C it's kind of
32:02 - like moving the camera over so I think a
32:05 - nice way of doing that wasn't the
32:06 - greatest demonstration I thought it was
32:07 - going to be much more interesting um um
32:10 - I think what what would work really well
32:12 - here is what if I just say person.
32:14 - position dox what if I always just
32:16 - offset the view by that person's
32:18 - Exposition only not its Exposition
32:21 - negative it Exposition because as that
32:22 - person's moving I want to offset the
32:24 - view further back so let's do that let's
32:27 - run this and you can see look at that
32:30 - now the um obstacle is moving so the
32:33 - physics haven't changed right the
32:35 - physics of this scenario are 100% the
32:38 - same it's just our view is changing and
32:40 - I could do like weird stuff like I could
32:42 - say like times. five and then you kind
32:46 - of have this like weird like the view is
32:49 - is like the camera's moving but not as
32:51 - fast anyway that's kind of that's kind
32:52 - of crazy it's sort of hard to see it
32:54 - just looks like they're Crossing but if
32:55 - there are multiple things moving at
32:56 - different speeds you might even get some
32:58 - kind of crazy Parallax effect but anyway
33:00 - I'm going to keep things simple right
33:01 - now and just keep this only I don't want
33:03 - the person I think all the way at the
33:04 - left I like them kind of shift it over
33:06 - so I'll just shift it over by like 50
33:08 - pixels so you can see this is now my
33:09 - view of the game and what I want now is
33:12 - when I press the space bar for the the
33:15 - um user to jump and guess what this is
33:18 - actually super easy um it's not super
33:21 - easy in general but it's super easy
33:23 - because all of the work of building a
33:25 - kind of mini physics engine into this
33:27 - example is already there now admittedly
33:29 - I haven't I didn't do that work in
33:30 - today's session but if you're following
33:32 - along in the other materials you're kind
33:33 - of that's you're sort of ready for that
33:35 - so in other words we are this is easy
33:37 - because I already have this apply Force
33:39 - function so I have a mechanism for
33:41 - saying here's a
33:43 - vector stick that Vector in the object
33:45 - and normally that Vector is put in um
33:50 - normally I don't know what normally
33:51 - means but as you saw in my other
33:53 - examples that Vector you might be uh put
33:56 - in draw so for example ex Le if I were
33:58 - to say uh a force is create vector and
34:02 - I'm just going to give it like a little
34:04 - push to the right so that it goes faster
34:07 - um actually let's have it let's give it
34:08 - a little push to the left so that it
34:10 - slows down this will be interesting and
34:12 - then if I say person. apply
34:17 - Force you can see now the person is
34:19 - slowing down and suddenly moving
34:20 - backwards and it's weird because it
34:22 - really looks like that other thing is
34:23 - moving so hard to like get your I think
34:25 - get a like more complex scene with lots
34:28 - more things you would have more of the
34:29 - sensation of the of this particular
34:32 - character moving um but you can see here
34:34 - now if I could also do something like if
34:36 - Mouse is
34:38 - pressed only then will I apply this
34:40 - Force so here the person is moving ah I
34:43 - want to slow down slow down slow down
34:44 - slow down go back up back up back up
34:46 - back up you know what it would also help
34:47 - if the person was a little animation of
34:49 - like a running person um you know
34:51 - obviously there's visual cues you could
34:53 - add to this to make this better okay so
34:54 - you can see this is how we apply a force
34:57 - now now what I want to do is apply not a
35:00 - continuous force in draw over and over
35:03 - again but a force only when a certain
35:04 - event happens so what I'm going to do is
35:06 - I'm going to add a function um this is
35:08 - something specifically the p5js library
35:11 - that function is going to be
35:14 - called key pressed ah I can't boy I'm
35:17 - usually such a good typist and today
35:19 - it's just a disaster um and what I want
35:21 - to do is I'm just going to check like if
35:22 - the key is the space bar that's a really
35:24 - easy way of just checking like what key
35:26 - was pressed if the key is the the
35:28 - character space then this is where I'm
35:30 - going to apply this Force so what should
35:32 - that force
35:33 - be and I'm going to call that that a
35:35 - variable jump and I'm going to say
35:37 - create
35:38 - Vector now I want the user to do what
35:40 - jump in the air straight in the air so
35:42 - I'm going to just give it a force
35:43 - pointing up which is zero comma some
35:46 - some negative number now normally if you
35:48 - normally in a lot of my other examples
35:51 - you'll see generally forces have very
35:53 - small amounts
35:55 - 0.112 3 7 9
35:58 - 841
35:59 - um I had a joke there that I forgot to
36:02 - do but I I'll make it happen later um it
36:05 - was a terrible joke anyway um
36:08 - so I just like lost my breath for a
36:10 - second train of thought um okay so
36:13 - normally you want sort of like a small
36:14 - number because if a force is something
36:15 - being applied continuously that thing is
36:17 - going into the object's acceleration
36:19 - continuously and numbers can get out of
36:20 - control very fast in a kind of canvas
36:22 - animation environment things going crazy
36:24 - but this is an instantaneous Force for
36:26 - it to have an effect it needs to be
36:27 - something rather large so let's make
36:29 - this a negative one and then I just want
36:31 - to say person. apply Force jump okay so
36:36 - let's see if this is enough for
36:40 - us okay here it comes uh there we go I'm
36:44 - jumping now interestingly enough I win I
36:48 - fly to the heavens that was an easy game
36:51 - on no obstacle will ever hit me again so
36:53 - why did that not appear to do anything
36:55 - like you might imagine it should
36:58 - well remember if if you apply a force to
37:01 - something moving up it's going to move
37:02 - up and if there's no Force to push it
37:05 - back down it's not going to move down
37:06 - that's like Newton's first law of motion
37:09 - um so we need to have gravity in this
37:11 - world and so in that is a force that
37:15 - should be applied continuously in the
37:17 - opposite direction so I'm going to
37:19 - create a vector and I'm going to make
37:20 - this sort of a small vector and I'm
37:22 - going to say person. apply Force gravity
37:26 - so now I want to continue continuously
37:28 - apply
37:29 - gravity oh I hit 100 people that's very
37:31 - exciting 103 people are watching YouTube
37:33 - I should check the chat is it still
37:35 - working uh okay now ah so look at that
37:38 - what happened now oh
37:40 - no right we've got a problem gravity was
37:43 - applying and there's apparently this is
37:45 - a quicksand simulation right so I don't
37:48 - have a sense of the ground here now this
37:50 - is where we get into a lot of trouble
37:52 - with our wanting to be true to the
37:54 - physics of the world you know in truth
37:57 - gravity is a force on me so my body is
38:00 - applying a force to the floor and then
38:01 - there's like this like the third lot of
38:03 - motion with the equal and opposite and
38:05 - there's you know tension force because
38:07 - the floor is attached to some be I don't
38:09 - I'm lost already but I think this is a
38:11 - scenario where hello it's just a
38:13 - rectangle on a screen so I think we
38:15 - could probably just say you know what
38:17 - don't go below the bottom so in that
38:19 - sense one of the things we could do and
38:21 - I'm this this particle this person
38:23 - object actually from the previous
38:25 - example has this edges function and so
38:28 - let's use that function and let's forget
38:29 - about this uh this aspect of it let's
38:33 - just say okay what do we do if this
38:36 - object is going below um falling below
38:40 - the uh the window itself so this old
38:43 - code here this old code Like This Old
38:45 - House anybody ever watched This Old
38:46 - House on PBS I kind of is this kind of
38:49 - like this old code instead of coding
38:50 - rainbow May should just called it this
38:52 - old
38:53 - code anyway let see if anybody gets that
38:55 - reference I don't even know if I do it's
38:56 - just sort of like this weird childhood
38:58 - memory that like popped into my head um
39:01 - so this old code I did have a point here
39:04 - was a bouncing code so something is
39:06 - falling its velocity reverses Direction
39:09 - and turns around so it's for bouncing
39:10 - but I don't really want bouncing here
39:11 - right now I mean I might want bouncing
39:12 - what I want is jump and stick stick The
39:14 - Landing kind of gymnastics stick The
39:16 - Landing so um so what I'm going to do
39:20 - actually is I'm just going to multiply
39:23 - its velocity times zero meaning if it
39:26 - hits the bottom
39:28 - its velocity multiplying its y component
39:30 - of its velocity makes its y velocity
39:32 - zero meaning it's instantly stuck to the
39:33 - bottom that's like the least accurate
39:35 - physics simulation thing I could ever
39:37 - possibly do but I think it will work in
39:38 - this case and then I also just want to
39:40 - like let's keep the position at the
39:42 - height so let's not get into like a
39:44 - weird thing where it's like a little bit
39:45 - below if it goes below at any point stop
39:48 - it from moving set it back to the bottom
39:50 - so now if we run this oh okay person is
39:53 - not defined so I must have a syntax
39:55 - error
39:56 - somewhere uh
39:58 - uh so this is this is a good thing to
40:01 - happen because this will happen to you
40:03 - um let's look what did what what did I
40:04 - add let's uh oh I think I oh I added I
40:07 - think I lost a curly bracket that's all
40:09 - I did so look this this closes this
40:12 - curly bracket this closes that Curly
40:14 - bracket and the I needed a curly bracket
40:16 - for this whole person Constructor
40:17 - function okay so let's run this now
40:20 - oh bye the quick sand is still active
40:23 - Okay so I think we have a problem which
40:25 - is uh that I just didn't call that edges
40:27 - function here so I also uh want to after
40:31 - I update I want to call edges to do that
40:34 - test for the edges and you can see the
40:35 - person is not falling more now I could
40:37 - press jump oh boy so that force is way
40:40 - too weak I'm not making it over that
40:42 - square anytime soon so let's kind of
40:44 - just play with some numbers here let's
40:46 - give it like make it 10 times as strong
40:49 - there we go whoa that was a really high
40:52 - jump oh
40:54 - quick uh okay so that worked um so you
40:57 - know know uh maybe let's try half split
41:00 - the
41:01 - difference it's pretty good I might have
41:03 - to actually time this
41:06 - correctly that was perfect okay that was
41:08 - very exciting okay so that's kind of the
41:10 - basic idea I kind of want to go further
41:13 - with this because I should add an array
41:15 - of obstacles and I should do a collision
41:17 - detection test I think maybe I'm going
41:20 - to kind of like pause here for right now
41:22 - maybe I would come back to this example
41:24 - a little bit later because I think there
41:25 - were some other questions that I wanted
41:26 - to look at I also I feel like maybe I
41:28 - just need like a moment to breathe um uh
41:32 - and
41:34 - um and uh kind of catch my train of
41:37 - thought so this is the basic idea you
41:39 - know there wasn't really a lot this is a
41:40 - kind of very I I would love it if some
41:42 - of you watching this perhaps when I post
41:44 - this code later uh take this code and
41:46 - kind of um um kind of put your spin on
41:49 - it add an animation add a character add
41:51 - a sound add uh multiple obstacles maybe
41:54 - think about the view the view is like a
41:56 - little bit uh we weird right now um but
41:59 - um anyway so uh okay so I'm going to
42:02 - just check this chat here to see if
42:03 - there's any
42:06 - questions
42:08 - uh okay um wow there's lots of people
42:11 - watching um let me go over to uh here
42:15 - let's see am I still streaming on
42:18 - Facebook with 70 viewers this is insane
42:21 - uh okay this is definitely the most
42:23 - people I've ever had watched live and
42:25 - there are 10 people on Twitch
42:28 - and um okay great uh all right um all
42:34 - right so let me okay so let me go back
42:36 - to the uh kadenz Forum I probably should
42:39 - put the questions here but I'm gonna I'm
42:41 - going to look for another question to
42:42 - answer and once I get to one hour so I'm
42:45 - at so I'm my my sort of plan I'm GNA
42:47 - have a little te
42:50 - here my plan for this was to do this for
42:54 - about two hours from 11: to 1
42:57 - um again if those of you who are just
42:58 - sort of tuning in late so to speak I'm
43:00 - going to be doing these once a week or
43:01 - twice a week like I might do this
43:03 - hopefully do this again on Thursday or
43:04 - Friday this week um and I do have a long
43:07 - list of topics and various tutorials I'm
43:10 - kind of just getting back into the
43:11 - groove of things today so this is a
43:13 - little bit haphazard but I I do want to
43:15 - have a sort of longer term view of of
43:17 - topics sound being a big one sound in
43:19 - the browser p5js Sound Library um more
43:21 - connecting computer vision uh more git
43:25 - and GitHub uh Chrome
43:27 - extensions um some more service side
43:30 - programming with node stuff oh I have
43:32 - this crazy Minecraft tutorial
43:34 - idea because you know I'm trying to see
43:36 - if I
43:37 - can I don't know I'll talk talk about
43:39 - that later I'm too embarrassed to talk
43:40 - about it right now uh okay so let me go
43:43 - back to um the forums and I did post a
43:50 - uh thread where I ask people to ask
43:52 - their questions to the thread um ah okay
43:56 - so I'm what I'm going to do right now is
43:58 - kind of just um answer some of these
43:59 - questions a bit more uh rapid fire not
44:03 - necessarily um program them uh by the
44:06 - way I'm just curious um if this would
44:10 - interest people uh if I I was thinking
44:12 - of doing a coding challenge today of the
44:15 - and do reaction
44:17 - diffusion uh so I'm going to just do an
44:19 - image search so um reaction diffusion is
44:22 - a kind of um chemical reaction type
44:25 - simulation that you can do with all
44:26 - sorts of patterns like this and I was
44:28 - thinking of doing that as a kind of
44:30 - 15minute coding challenge toward the end
44:32 - of this session so if people are
44:33 - interested in that I got one request of
44:35 - a couple requests of that and I was like
44:37 - oh I've done that before I haven't done
44:39 - it in over a year or uh like uh so I
44:42 - have to like review it and look back at
44:44 - it so it'll be somewhat fresh but um but
44:46 - I do know it's possible I I have a
44:48 - processing example that does this so
44:49 - that's what I'm sort of thinking um okay
44:52 - uh okay so the question I'm
44:55 - um uh where are we
44:59 - here uh H so people seem interested yes
45:01 - people are saying good reaction
45:03 - diffusion okay so I'm going to answer a
45:04 - bunch more questions and then I'm going
45:06 - to uh do the reaction diffusion okay so
45:08 - let me read you a question uh taking for
45:10 - example 01 drag Force how to use shapes
45:15 - different shapes for liquid objects
45:17 - triangles or circles okay this is a
45:19 - great question so let me first show you
45:21 - this
45:21 - example uh and I'm going to go back to
45:23 - the P5 editor so one of the examples
45:25 - that I have in the nature of code
45:27 - materials is a drag Force which is like
45:31 - a air resistance or fluid resistance
45:33 - force if I run this example you'll be
45:36 - able to see this
45:37 - uh quite easily here so what do I have
45:40 - over here I have a scene with these
45:41 - falling circles one of the things
45:44 - interesting that you can see is that
45:45 - objects fall at the exact same
45:48 - acceleration due to gravity right it's
45:50 - that number that you could look up on
45:51 - Wikipedia that I can never seem to
45:53 - remember the acceleration due to gravity
45:55 - it's because even though acceleration
45:59 - is the acceleration of an object is it's
46:03 - ma the gravitational force divided by
46:06 - mass so you would think like well if a
46:08 - something's more massive it's going to
46:10 - accelerate less but remember
46:12 - gravitational force is scaled by mass so
46:14 - that Mass gets canceled out that's why
46:16 - you drop two things from the leading
46:17 - Tower of Pisa or whatever Galileo or
46:20 - whoever experiment that was they fall at
46:21 - the same acceleration now obviously air
46:23 - resistance and other funny factors can
46:25 - play a role and
46:27 - this demonstrates that precisely here
46:29 - because what happens when these two
46:31 - objects land in something like water the
46:33 - fluid resistance is going to cause a
46:36 - much greater acceleration on the smaller
46:39 - one which the less Mass so greater
46:41 - acceleration means greater acceleration
46:44 - in the reverse Direction meaning it
46:45 - slows down more and you can see the
46:47 - bigger one slows down less so this is an
46:49 - example I have and the the question
46:51 - really gets that you know the the
46:53 - example is really about how to calculate
46:55 - that force and just um you know in here
46:58 - in the there is a liquid object and you
47:00 - can see that force is calculated in here
47:03 - it is a constant coefficient of drag uh
47:06 - it's also it's also weighted according
47:08 - to how fast the object is moving the
47:10 - object is moving faster the force is
47:11 - greater the the speed squared actually
47:14 - but that's sort of the interesting bit
47:16 - really but I think if you want to be
47:17 - creative about how you use this um you
47:21 - might think about well what can be
47:22 - regions on the screen of resistance so
47:25 - you could imagine a where you're sort of
47:27 - have to steer around and you want to
47:29 - avoid you know pockets of mud or maybe
47:31 - there's some Icy patches that cause you
47:32 - to speed up you could actually even
47:34 - build that into the floor of that sort
47:36 - of jumping simulation we just did so
47:40 - um so anyway but this does a very
47:43 - simplistic thing which uh if I come back
47:45 - over here to the Whiteboard I really
47:47 - don't want to erase my picture of this
47:48 - bird somebody screenshot this and save
47:50 - it forever don't really do
47:53 - that
47:54 - uh um
47:57 - this eraser is not good but it will do
47:59 - for right now um so um okay so if we
48:05 - have a rectangle and if we have a circle
48:09 - how can we determine if the circle is
48:12 - inside the rectangle now I've did it in
48:13 - a very simplistic way I actually am not
48:17 - I bet you in my example I'm not taking
48:19 - into consideration that Circle size
48:21 - which is a key factor I'm just looking
48:23 - at this XY point right and it's very
48:26 - easy I can say if x if this is the
48:28 - liquid's X and this is the liquid's W
48:32 - and this is the uh particles position
48:36 - and it's positiony all I need to check
48:38 - is is position dox greater than x
48:42 - meaning it's on this side of the
48:43 - boundary is
48:46 - positionx less than X Plus width meaning
48:49 - is it on this side of the boundary and
48:50 - the same for y so I'm doing just a
48:52 - boundary test now really I should do
48:54 - something more sophisticated by thinking
48:57 - about uh um the radius with this circle
49:00 - to see if even if it like touches it
49:02 - slightly but you know in a lot of cases
49:05 - it doesn't really matter so um something
49:07 - you could do uh If This Were uh a for
49:11 - examp so this would also be not so hard
49:14 - If This Were if the sort of liquid area
49:16 - was a circle and this circle was moving
49:18 - toward it what I could do is just do a
49:20 - distance calculation P5 has a distance
49:22 - function so a distance calculation
49:25 - between those two uh elements and if the
49:29 - distance is greater than the sum of the
49:30 - two radi then they're overlapping then
49:32 - they're not overlapping if the distance
49:34 - is less than they are overlapping so
49:35 - you'll actually see this I've done this
49:36 - I feel like in the last month like in
49:38 - countless examples that I have in sort
49:40 - of basic intersection test somebody
49:42 - hopefully can maybe find a link to one
49:43 - of my videos that actually implements
49:45 - this but it's really just comes down to
49:47 - a geometry problem working with squares
49:50 - and circles is pretty easy uh any type
49:53 - of arbitrary geometry gets much more
49:55 - difficult however there sometimes a
49:57 - trick you can use so one thing I'll
49:59 - mention so you know we could sit here
50:01 - and be here all day to be like now let's
50:02 - look at a trapezoid with a triangle and
50:05 - I I just I don't think I it's a good use
50:07 - of the time to go through every one of
50:09 - those scenarios but um I would love to
50:13 - to do a bunch more but anyway but I do
50:15 - want to just mention I think what can
50:16 - sometimes be a useful trick I'm going to
50:18 - see if this paper towel which even
50:20 - though it's not very good for the
50:21 - environment I'm going to use this I'm
50:23 - going to reuse this single paper towel
50:24 - as many amount of times as possible but
50:26 - it works a little better to erase here's
50:29 - something that I might suggest you do so
50:31 - let's say you have the scenario where
50:34 - you have a a map of um of a of a
50:38 - continent and I'm going to try to draw
50:40 - like sort of Africa so let's say this is
50:43 - can you see that wow it's so light um I
50:48 - got to get some I got to get some better
50:50 - marker whiteboard stuff here so let's
50:52 - say um this is going to show my lack of
50:55 - job I'm not going to attempt to do any
50:56 - real geography um so let's say you have
50:59 - a bunch of I was just trying to not be
51:01 - us Centric picking a different continent
51:04 - than North America um so let's say you
51:06 - have some map and you're about to have a
51:09 - particle move through this map and maybe
51:12 - you're doing some kind of crazy data
51:13 - visualization where you know some type
51:16 - of data population data or you know um
51:20 - environmental science data is related to
51:22 - the kind of drag force that these
51:24 - regions have so you could start to think
51:26 - oh my God I need to know all of these
51:28 - vertices ah vertices so many vertices
51:31 - then I got to do this elaborate
51:32 - computational geometry math and blah
51:34 - blah blah to figure out is this circle
51:35 - in this one or this one here's another
51:37 - thing you could do what if you
51:39 - secretly or not so secretly had behind
51:42 - the scenes an image like a PNG file or a
51:46 - JPEG and that jpeg had exactly that same
51:49 - map with exactly the same dimensions
51:52 - that as the one that you're viewing on
51:54 - the screen now you could actually be the
51:55 - exactly the same one
51:57 - and what if all of the countries all of
51:59 - the regions on that map had a unique
52:01 - color so this is something you would
52:02 - make in like Photoshop or you would find
52:04 - you might just make this hard manually
52:06 - make this you can obviously make it
52:08 - algorithmically as well so each one of
52:09 - these had a absolutely completely unique
52:12 - color so what you could do is say I'm
52:14 - I'm a circle moving around the screen
52:16 - and I have an XY and wherever I might be
52:19 - I'm going to take my XY and look up that
52:22 - point in this offscreen SE secret image
52:27 - and I'm going to look up the pixel color
52:29 - and if that pixel color is that perfect
52:31 - beautiful pink that I've always loved
52:33 - then I know I'm over that country so I I
52:35 - think using pixel colors as is a nice
52:38 - way if you know this only works if this
52:41 - thing is static you know if it's
52:43 - changing then is your secret like color
52:46 - mapping thing also changing but this is
52:48 - I often it's useful to think is there a
52:50 - way that I can create this effect or use
52:52 - some sort of other type of data to help
52:54 - me through this problem so maybe one of
52:55 - you will now do this project which is a
52:58 - ma data visualization with uh things
53:01 - particles moving through it and the uh
53:04 - the uh drag force that each country or
53:07 - region applies to the particles moving
53:09 - is related to some piece of data I don't
53:10 - know if that would be interesting or not
53:12 - please try that to share it with me uh I
53:14 - don't I sometimes I have an idea it's
53:16 - usually my ideas are terrible but I
53:17 - never Implement my ideas so at least I
53:19 - could say them on the Internet on the
53:22 - Facebook and um somebody might uh make
53:25 - them okay uh I should really look at the
53:27 - YouTube chat I've been highly neglecting
53:29 - the chat uh and uh I I can't believe
53:33 - that I'm actually gaining viewers today
53:35 - I usually just lose viewers um okay so
53:38 - uh I don't see
53:41 - um um okay so I don't
53:44 - see uh any other uh comments in the chat
53:46 - right now related to that so I'm going
53:48 - to move on and go back to this forum so
53:50 - I'm going to read the next question
53:52 - which comes from Peter one thing I'm
53:54 - confused about is just sort of a general
53:57 - life
53:58 - thing I'm on the internet here and
54:00 - people are asking questions and
54:02 - sometimes they have like a handle like
54:04 - uh you know unicorn
54:05 - 57 um and then I'm happy to just say
54:07 - unicorn 57 writes in and ask and
54:09 - sometimes people have their actual name
54:11 - and even like an image so I don't know
54:12 - is it appropriate for me to pull up
54:14 - something that somebody wrote and their
54:15 - name is here or their image is here say
54:17 - their name it's nice to acknowledge
54:18 - people but I don't want I want to invade
54:20 - people privacy I never know what to do
54:21 - about that so I'm just using first names
54:23 - Peter writes um p5js editor on MacBook
54:26 - question I'm wondering why when I open
54:28 - up a I should like read these in voices
54:30 - or something not I can't do voices um
54:33 - like a British accent or a French accent
54:35 - would that be like obnoxious probably be
54:37 - obnoxious okay p5js editor on MacBook
54:39 - question I'm wondering why when I open
54:41 - up a project again it only shows one tab
54:44 - I can open each JavaScript module but I
54:46 - end up with several editor windows for
54:47 - one project how do I put the tabs back
54:49 - together yeah so you know you might be
54:52 - experiencing so this is a good question
54:54 - so one thing I should say is that
54:57 - um this this p5js editor is a pretty new
55:00 - project it's only maybe had a year of
55:02 - development it's also something that I
55:05 - think that we as a processing Foundation
55:07 - as an entity are questioning whether
55:08 - we're going to be able to maintain and
55:09 - support it in the future it takes a
55:11 - tremendous amount of time to maintain a
55:13 - desktop application that works across
55:15 - multiple um operating systems now of
55:18 - course we're keeping this up and using
55:20 - it and I'm using it in these videos in a
55:21 - lot of courses and people are using it
55:23 - right now but one of the things we're
55:24 - looking to do is actually develop a
55:26 - browser browser based editor as a more
55:28 - kind of sustainable model for p5js as a
55:30 - project of having a kind of beginner
55:32 - friendly editor so I could say a lot
55:33 - more about that I just wanted to sort of
55:34 - mention that but probably the best place
55:37 - for this question or discussion would be
55:39 - on GitHub itself um and uh I'll just
55:45 - show you guys where you can so if I go
55:47 - to github.com
55:49 - processing so I'm just going to show you
55:51 - this URL really briefly this URL
55:53 - github.com pressing this is all of the
55:55 - GitHub repositories for all of the
55:57 - processing Foundation projects um and
55:59 - you can see here uh processing p5js
56:02 - website processing docs which is like
56:04 - the reference and examples P5 J editor
56:07 - that's the one I want to go to for a
56:08 - second Library so the P5 J sound there's
56:10 - a lot of repositories here so if you're
56:12 - finding a bug or something confusing you
56:13 - can try to find the repository
56:15 - associated with that particular project
56:17 - and this is very confusing if you don't
56:19 - know which one tweet me I will help
56:21 - you uh so um uh don't the Facebook me
56:25 - though I I don't I'm afraid of the
56:27 - Facebook okay so um so p5g has editor
56:31 - I'm going to click on that and I'm going
56:33 - so first thing you could do by the way
56:34 - is you're really not sure if if you have
56:35 - a question or a bug is you could
56:37 - actually just go to forum.
56:38 - processing.org you know you could ask me
56:41 - this is the point you've you've done the
56:42 - right thing you've asked this question
56:43 - to me so um but I'm just kind of I'm
56:46 - very bad at answering questions
56:47 - succinctly I'm W gone off of the stent
56:49 - but I should mention that there are uh
56:51 - several categories here about p5js so on
56:55 - the processing form for p5js programming
56:57 - questions this is a good place to ask as
56:59 - well um and now but a bug would go here
57:03 - under issues or a feature question so
57:05 - this is a place and this can be you know
57:07 - this is an intimidating scary place
57:10 - there's lots of technical posts it seems
57:11 - like oh there's all these Advanced super
57:13 - programmers who are going to be you know
57:15 - think my question is stupid and I am
57:17 - telling you I've said this again in
57:19 - previous live streams it's just
57:20 - important to say this always that um the
57:22 - goal of the processing Foundation is to
57:24 - be a completely welcoming environment to
57:26 - to people of all skill levels and all
57:29 - backgrounds and all ages and you cannot
57:31 - do anything wrong here and we our goal
57:33 - and if and if something if youve felt
57:35 - that you did something wrong please let
57:36 - me know so I can help resolve and make
57:38 - it a happy friendly place a welcoming
57:40 - place an accessible place for everyone
57:42 - um but this is a place where you would
57:43 - post like I think I found a bug in the
57:45 - editor um and you would do that by
57:47 - clicking new issue so um but it does
57:49 - feel intimidating and I'm I'm here to
57:51 - help with that if it's an issue for you
57:53 - um so you might look around there might
57:55 - actually be a discussion this but one
57:57 - thing that you'll notice about is so
57:59 - this is my example right now 01 drag
58:01 - force and I'm actually operating with
58:04 - two tabs right here particle. Js liquid.
58:07 - Js so uh there are two tabs guide my
58:10 - code in two places so if I were to now
58:12 - quit the editor completely quit the
58:14 - editor and I were to go back and find
58:17 - that example which is this one 01 drag
58:20 - force and I were to just uh take that
58:23 - folder and drag it onto the editor it's
58:26 - it's going to open it up again it's
58:28 - opening it only on particle. JS now
58:31 - yours might actually look like this uh
58:33 - I'm doing something really quick show
58:35 - cyar off right it might actually
58:36 - suddenly open up like this and you think
58:38 - oh I lost liquid. JS but you didn't
58:42 - actually lose it it's just the editor is
58:45 - not currently not smart enough to
58:47 - remember which files you had open as
58:49 - tabs and reopen those for you so if I go
58:53 - to the finder those files are all there
58:56 - in the directory but the editor by
58:58 - default is kind of just picking one file
59:01 - to open I don't even know which logic it
59:03 - is so if you're seeing this the first
59:05 - thing to do is go to settings and go
59:08 - down here to show sidebar and turn the
59:11 - sidebar on because now you can see the
59:13 - directory structure here and if I were
59:15 - to click on liquid. JS I've got it back
59:19 - here so that tab is now here audio is
59:20 - still working everything's still working
59:22 - okay so that's how to get that tab back
59:24 - in view
59:27 - however there's more to this story so
59:30 - let's say what I want to do now is also
59:33 - add another
59:35 - tab so I'm going to use this little oh
59:37 - camera went off
59:43 - um am I
59:45 - back I'm back I'm gonna use this little
59:48 - plus sign here I'm gonna click that and
59:50 - I'm going to say um a particle and a a
59:54 - liquid and now we're going to have a
59:55 - rain rbow so I'm going to add a tab
59:57 - called rainbow. JS and I'm going to just
60:00 - in this tab write a function called
60:02 - rainbow and I'm going to say
60:04 - console.log
60:06 - rainbow okay so I just added some code
60:10 - that I want to make use of in my project
60:12 - so what I want to do is go back to uh
60:14 - sketch.jpg
60:26 - run it and all I'm going to get is this
60:28 - very sad error rainbow is not defined
60:31 - and I say to you world there is such a
60:34 - thing as a rainbow out there Rainbows
60:35 - are defined I love rainbows I'm a bit
60:38 - weird I know but uh rainbow is defined I
60:42 - defined it right here in this tab
60:44 - rainbow. JS look there's its definition
60:46 - so what's the problem here and I have
60:48 - gone over this before but I think it's
60:49 - worth mentioning because a lot of people
60:50 - have been asking this in Forum
60:52 - posts if you are at creating new
60:55 - JavaScript files what's the thing that's
60:57 - actually loading in the browser your
60:58 - JavaScript files aren't loading in the
61:00 - browser an HTML page is loading in the
61:02 - browser what page is loading in the
61:03 - browser this page
61:05 - index.html Why does it know about your
61:07 - JavaScript files is because the HTML
61:09 - page has a reference to each one of them
61:10 - has a reference to particles.js liquid.
61:12 - Js sketch. Js so this is a place where
61:15 - if you're adding new files you also need
61:17 - to make sure that there is a reference
61:19 - to them and so now I can reference that
61:21 - rainbow. JS file and I can uh run this
61:25 - again again and we can see there now is
61:27 - a rainbow rainbow is
61:29 - defined okay let me check the YouTube
61:32 - chat to see if there's any
61:33 - questions uh oh good I'm Hope Oh Peter
61:36 - did I answered your question how
61:37 - wonderful okay uh great now here's the
61:40 - thing I um yeah okay uh okay so I was
61:44 - gonna say something else uh okay so let
61:48 - me where am I I'm back in the form let
61:51 - me look at the next question okay so I'm
61:53 - um sorry I need a moment here I've been
61:55 - doing this for now an hour and two
61:57 - minutes straight this is a lot a lot
61:59 - hard I teach classes classes are like
62:01 - three hours long but the thing about
62:02 - this online live stream thing that I
62:04 - feel like there is no moment to breathe
62:07 - like I can't have dead air or be doing
62:10 - some other weird thing so it's
62:12 - definitely takes more different kind of
62:13 - energy I'm
62:14 - realizing uh okay um llan asks I was
62:20 - just wondering I haven't actually read
62:21 - these I should read these questions in
62:23 - advance I need like a screener question
62:25 - screener like Brian L I love Brian L do
62:27 - you love Brian
62:28 - L okay I was just wondering if using a
62:31 - gravity well or two and a particle class
62:34 - it would be possible to make a Spyro
62:35 - graph with the principles you covered in
62:37 - session two oh boy this is a hard
62:39 - question let's Google
62:42 - spirograph and look at some pictures I
62:45 - think that'll
62:46 - help this is this is going to be a good
62:49 - uh coding
62:51 - challenge so yes so look at this
62:55 - interesting so these are great how uh
62:57 - 100 yes yes yes yes and yes and in fact
63:01 - uh P5 art on Twitter um what I would
63:03 - recommend to get some effects like this
63:06 - is look at the attraction ex the
63:07 - gravitational attraction example so the
63:10 - gravitational attraction example Works
63:12 - let's try this blue pen uh with this
63:15 - idea of an attractor and an object so if
63:18 - the object is attracted to the center
63:21 - it's just going to move like this it's
63:23 - going to get pulled into it then it's
63:24 - going to go past it and then it's going
63:26 - to get pulled back it's going to go past
63:27 - it then it's going to get pulled back
63:28 - almost like a spring now I'm not
63:30 - actually simulating a spring Force
63:32 - although that would also be a great
63:33 - thing I would love to do that as an
63:34 - example today um but what if you give
63:37 - and this was a question also asked on
63:39 - the Forum so you're the effect that
63:41 - you're going to get of this object
63:42 - moving is just going to be in a straight
63:44 - line back and forth with gravitational
63:46 - attraction and actually why not let's go
63:49 - um let's go let's go actually do this so
63:51 - I'm going to grab my um gravitational
63:54 - attraction example
63:56 - and I'm going to open this one up in the
63:58 - editor let's just go to the editor and
64:00 - do command
64:01 - o and go to uh gravitational
64:05 - attraction and run this okay so you can
64:09 - see what this example is doing by
64:11 - default it's showing you um this kind of
64:15 - object orbiting in a way this particular
64:17 - circle now this appears much like
64:20 - planetary orbits and you know the
64:23 - formula for gravity is in there much
64:25 - like that formula for gravity is in
64:27 - there in the universe but there's many
64:29 - things about this that are highly
64:30 - inaccurate in terms of an actual you
64:32 - know true to life physics simulation
64:33 - it's you know but it's it's kind of
64:35 - along the way there but it's let's let
64:37 - me go back and uh to this example and
64:42 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to
64:44 - look at this particle object and I'm
64:46 - going to change its initial velocity
64:49 - from one comma 0 to 0 comma 0 so it has
64:52 - no initial velocity to start and let's
64:54 - run it again so this is what talking
64:56 - about with no initial velocity it's just
64:58 - going to move back and forth because and
65:00 - it's you know it doesn't it's it's
65:02 - eventually probably going to it's doing
65:03 - some kind of crazy thing like it goes
65:05 - much further on one side and you know
65:07 - there's all sorts of rounding stuff and
65:08 - I'm using some strange constraints so
65:10 - who knows why all this is happening but
65:12 - you can see that it's kind of moving
65:13 - back and forth so that initial
65:17 - velocity if I come back over here gives
65:20 - it a place to move to start so that as
65:23 - it's being pulled in it's kind of doing
65:26 - this so now I'm not doing it drawing it
65:28 - accurately but you could imagine what if
65:31 - you give it an initial velocity and
65:33 - let's give it a much bigger initial
65:34 - velocity to start right uh or or um
65:37 - that's fine just leave it let's you know
65:39 - you can see this is what it's doing now
65:41 - it has that initial velocity so it's
65:42 - kind of orbiting so what I would suggest
65:45 - you try to do is number one is uh draw
65:48 - Trails so you could do that by not
65:50 - erasing the background so it smears and
65:52 - I could actually really uh quickly um
65:56 - just make that happen for us by putting
65:58 - the background in setup and we can kind
66:00 - of see what sort of pattern are we going
66:01 - to get um so that's sort of option
66:03 - number one is you can kind of not erase
66:06 - the background other thing you might try
66:08 - is you know what's a good initial
66:10 - velocity what's a good uh What are some
66:12 - good constraints um what happens if you
66:14 - do multiple ones of these what happens
66:16 - oh you're going to get really really
66:17 - nice patterns if you have multiple
66:20 - attractors in different places um so um
66:24 - and uh what there have been a lot of
66:26 - projects uh in along this vein this is a
66:28 - quite an old project I'm going to say I
66:30 - think it's by Tom Carden Metro and and
66:33 - probably collaboration with some other
66:34 - people uh metropop denim I'm going to
66:37 - pull this up let's see uh um so this is
66:40 - a project that was kind of a process I
66:42 - think it was done I'm pretty sure it was
66:43 - done in processing because I seem to
66:44 - remember it being on the processing
66:45 - exhibition but uh right um so I'm just
66:48 - going to look at this image and kind of
66:50 - zoom into it so this is the result of I
66:52 - you know I can't speak to 100% exactly
66:55 - how this was done but my impression of
66:57 - this is this was using attraction forces
67:00 - with multiple invisible attractors
67:02 - everywhere and releasing a lot of
67:04 - particles into the system and just
67:06 - seeing their Trail and drawing nice sort
67:08 - of alpha Blended line Trails all over
67:10 - the place so you might sort of see and
67:12 - then this was combined with a fashion
67:14 - photography uh and so if I go back to
67:16 - that uh Google image search you can see
67:19 - how um uh you can see some of these
67:21 - images here with different fashion
67:23 - photography but it would be interesting
67:24 - to think about what if you you had sort
67:26 - of a a dress or a shoe or some item of
67:29 - clothing or some other pattern and you
67:31 - actually placed or a person's silhouette
67:33 - and you place those attraction points
67:35 - along Contours or on the tips of fingers
67:37 - what type of kind of or you know you did
67:39 - this in real time with a connect so as
67:41 - you're moving your hands your hands are
67:42 - the attractor see go and make these
67:44 - projects see if they're interesting um
67:46 - so there's a lot of Rich possibilities
67:48 - there I would however
67:50 - recommend that if you're doing this and
67:52 - wow it's kind of amazing to me how
67:54 - stable this particular uh orbit is I I
67:58 - assume it's going to get off over time
68:00 - like if we watch this if I set this
68:01 - running for 24 hours it's eventually
68:03 - going to like sort of fill in the whole
68:05 - screen um but one thing I would
68:07 - recommend is looking into not using this
68:10 - not erase the background technique so
68:13 - and I actually have another example
68:15 - there's a tutorial it's on YouTube If
68:16 - you Google you know shiftman object
68:18 - Trails um what if you actually have the
68:21 - particle store an array of all of its
68:23 - historical positions um you know it sort
68:26 - of depends what you're doing if your
68:27 - goal is to make a static image like a
68:29 - big poster then just not erasing the
68:31 - background is going to be fine but you
68:33 - have a larger animated system with other
68:34 - things moving and you want to see trails
68:36 - you're going to need a more flexible way
68:37 - of doing that okay um great I think that
68:41 - answers that question where am I let me
68:45 - check this
68:47 - chat uh uh okay um yes so by the way um
68:53 - so some people in the chat are
68:54 - rightfully mentioning that you could
68:55 - could absolutely just do this with uh uh
68:58 - oscillating simple harmonic motion and
69:00 - oscillating Behavior so using S and
69:02 - cosine functions and I have I do if um I
69:04 - have some other YouTube tutorials that
69:06 - do that as well and um um yeah okay
69:11 - um let me check how life is going here
69:15 - on the internet so let me go back uh
69:19 - comment was deleted let's go down okay
69:21 - so there's one more question on this
69:22 - thread that I think I'll get to um and
69:24 - then we'll see if have questions in the
69:26 - chat and then maybe we'll do the um
69:28 - diffusion
69:30 - thing my brain is starting to melt like
69:33 - talking straight for an hour and uh 10
69:36 - minutes okay how's audio video picture I
69:40 - don't look too like red and sweaty a
69:42 - little bit hot in
69:46 - here
69:48 - okay um let's see now where where's the
69:51 - world where in the World is Carmen San
69:55 - Diego go my brain uh okay one more
69:59 - question uh okay so this comes from
70:02 - Luca uh uh by the way I think I'm
70:05 - getting a bald spot can you guys see it
70:07 - maybe you can't see it
70:10 - um uh why sometimes the speed of our
70:14 - programmed objects seems to suddenly go
70:16 - crazy objects go out of control and we
70:18 - have to use function like limit is it
70:21 - just a float number is it just a
70:22 - floating uh Point numbers approximation
70:25 - problem okay I'm going to read the whole
70:26 - question that's part one of the
70:28 - question as this strange Behavior can
70:30 - sometimes happen while a program is
70:32 - running is it safe to always constrain
70:34 - velocity in our physics engine
70:36 - simulations how do we choose the limit
70:39 - is it purely an empirical trial and
70:40 - error approach or is there a better way
70:42 - this is a great question um and this is
70:45 - like this is like a I love this question
70:46 - because it's like a philosophical
70:47 - question like I almost don't have to
70:49 - type any code or I mean we could start
70:51 - opening up examples and try different
70:52 - constraints but it's really a sort of pH
70:56 - philosophical question and I think there
70:57 - is this sort of
70:59 - Continuum um you know I am my name is
71:03 - Jane and I am working at Nasa and we are
71:08 - trying to figure out how to get this
71:10 - rocket to you know properly go around
71:14 - this asteroid and uh do some important
71:17 - scientific
71:19 - thing you know my name is
71:22 - fr FR Francis I'm coming I know I need
71:26 - these names whatever I am a happy
71:30 - go-lucky person sitting at my computer
71:32 - making some goofy algorithmic
71:34 - art I think the answer to that that
71:36 - question is very different for those two
71:38 - different people you know there might
71:40 - certain scenarios might require a more
71:42 - significant amount of rigor in and I I
71:45 - really hate that word rigor but I think
71:46 - it's probably an appropriate use of it
71:48 - here in terms of the level of scientific
71:51 - accuracy um you know by definition the
71:54 - way I am doing my examples is
71:57 - scientifically inaccurate there is no
71:59 - way for me to make it accurate because
72:02 - there's no such thing as like a flat
72:03 - two-dimensional I mean there isn't
72:05 - theoretic okay let me even let me put it
72:07 - a different
72:08 - way the draw Loop is frame by frame
72:11 - animation so I'm showing you a picture
72:14 - then I'm taking a break for one 160th of
72:16 - a second and showing you another picture
72:18 - then I'm taking you a break for one 160
72:19 - a second and showing you another picture
72:21 - much like a flip
72:22 - book here here I'm gonna juggle
72:28 - here is a demonstration of juggling
72:30 - these are kind of hard to juggle but
72:31 - it's
72:33 - working I just showed you like an
72:35 - animation you're watching it as a video
72:37 - but in real life that's happening
72:39 - continuously I didn't toss this thing
72:40 - and take a break and wait and then it
72:42 - moves a little more so that fact of this
72:45 - it's called Oiler integration this this
72:48 - model of physics of this step by step
72:51 - this time increment being 1 160th of a
72:53 - second is by definition makes everything
72:56 - wildly not like the real world but are
72:59 - you really complaining when you're
73:00 - watching this not so much because it's
73:02 - kind of doing the things you want to do
73:06 - now this the fact that we're starting
73:08 - from this place of inaccuracy means
73:11 - there's all these moments where um you
73:15 - know things aren't going to behave like
73:17 - we might expect or don't have the
73:18 - feeling of the real world so we do
73:20 - things like say velocity. liit or
73:22 - constrain this or like add this fudge
73:24 - Factor here and personally from my
73:27 - standpoint these are all excellent
73:29 - things to do in the scenario of I'm
73:32 - making an experiment an interactive
73:34 - exhibition I'm just trying out an idea
73:35 - I'm learning about programming um you
73:38 - know a lot of times I'll hear people say
73:39 - to
73:41 - me okay well I did this and it looks
73:44 - great but I cheated and if it looks
73:46 - great you didn't cheat you did it it's
73:48 - all cheating right it's all none of this
73:51 - is real there is no wizard behind the
73:54 - curtain or there is just wizard behind
73:55 - the curtain and The Wizard is you right
73:57 - it's all cheating so um I think in that
73:59 - case it's it's good practice to learn
74:01 - about these sort of limitations now
74:03 - sometimes the limitations will cause you
74:04 - other problems like in my jumping
74:07 - program I just have it stop immediately
74:09 - but what if I want you know it's
74:11 - actually suddenly there's like a water
74:13 - and so when there's water it goes
74:15 - through now I need to add some other
74:16 - code so sometimes the limitation will
74:18 - cause you another problem down the road
74:19 - and so it's just this kind of um
74:22 - Balancing Act and you it's a lot of back
74:23 - and forth so my General answer is there
74:26 - is no answer it's Case by case basis
74:28 - give it a try you need that now again
74:30 - though in certain
74:32 - scenarios you know U you need a higher
74:35 - level of accuracy and in that case it
74:37 - might be you could make the argument
74:39 - that JavaScript in the browser isn't the
74:41 - place for some of these more kind of
74:43 - rigorous scientific simulations and you
74:46 - know you might really need to apply the
74:47 - sort of more time uh calculus formulas
74:50 - to not have this kind of like step by
74:52 - step anyway so you go down that road but
74:54 - I I don't I don't ever go I don't you
74:56 - know I just I don't go down that road I
74:58 - sometimes maybe I do maybe maybe it's
75:00 - it's it's it's beautiful down that road
75:01 - and I should take a peek down that road
75:03 - and I I think there are lovely people
75:05 - down that road and sometimes you might
75:06 - need to go down that road but the
75:07 - context of what I'm doing here in the
75:08 - sort of coding rainbow world is to kind
75:10 - of generally find the sort of quick and
75:12 - dirty uh um uh um solutions for these
75:17 - kind of problems that create the feeling
75:19 - of the real world
75:21 - simulation rambling rant over let's see
75:24 - I bet you I lost just like 15 viewers
75:26 - during
75:27 - that uh yeah I did but they still have
75:29 - above a 100 people so um okay
75:34 - uh um all right so that was that
75:37 - question um I'm
75:39 - checking um I'm checking the world
75:45 - of uh oh gain to the m oh so some people
75:47 - maybe on Facebook it's quiet the audio
75:50 - is okay for people I I'm I'm afraid to
75:52 - make it louder so I'm just seeing some
75:54 - comments
75:55 - um I don't know if is there a live chat
75:57 - there's I'm sort of curious but I'm
75:59 - going to not look right now okay
76:04 - um okay so I think now I'm at an hour
76:07 - and 15 minutes I think it would be a
76:09 - good time today so what I want to do now
76:11 - is I want to look at my I I got through
76:14 - I think a good amount of questions I'm
76:15 - sure there are more I will answer them
76:17 - in the Forum by typing but what I want
76:19 - to do right now is a couple things one
76:22 - is I want to close out out
76:26 - this and I want to go to a URL that I
76:30 - keep which is my list of
76:34 - topics so this here is uh where I'm kind
76:38 - of keeping a list of topics as people
76:40 - send me suggestions uh and I think the
76:43 - one I'm going to do today is reaction
76:44 - diffusion which is right down here I
76:46 - have smaller topics I think I did uh I
76:49 - want to do K you know a lot of these U
76:51 - Google Maps ap5 Voice synthesis
76:53 - different editors sort of did that
76:55 - Twitter Bots there's some more stuff
76:56 - Chrome extensions Raspberry Pi neural
76:59 - networks more uh text stuff and node
77:02 - more computer vision other topics oops
77:06 - this GitHub for poets thing oh GitHub
77:07 - Pages I've got to do okay so this is my
77:11 - list of topics I I'm just sort of
77:12 - scanning this through because I would um
77:14 - love to hear feedback from you guys and
77:16 - uh and suggestions always uh but I think
77:18 - what I'm going to attempt to do is do
77:20 - the reaction diffusion algorithm and I'm
77:23 - going to do it as a coding challenge
77:25 - meaning um I'm going to kind of get
77:27 - myself up in I'm going to I'm going to
77:29 - take about 10 to 15 minutes right now to
77:32 - kind of find my old code for it look at
77:35 - it look at some web pages that have nice
77:36 - documentation of the algorithm uh kind
77:39 - of refresh my brain about it a little
77:40 - bit understand the code talk to you
77:42 - about it answer questions and then what
77:44 - I'm going to do is I'm going to stop and
77:46 - I'm going to just like clear everything
77:48 - and I'm going to um then program the
77:51 - whole thing from scratch in what I hope
77:52 - will be about 10 to 15 minutes and
77:54 - that's that will be a standalone video
77:55 - tutorial that we'll Live on YouTube
77:57 - that's my plan uh and I'm going to keep
77:59 - the uh YouTube chat open here
78:04 - um um and there okay so um you know
78:09 - these kind of classic generative
78:11 - algorithms tend to work really well for
78:12 - these coding challenges I still really
78:13 - need a haircut hopefully today I can get
78:16 - a because I feel like I like to look
78:18 - nice for these live streams I don't know
78:20 - how I don't know how possible that
78:21 - really is but you know to some extent uh
78:25 - by the way everyone keeps asking me for
78:26 - this a agario.io what is
78:30 - that some game no what is it
78:34 - agario agar.io oh yeah the Smash Hit
78:37 - game this is some game everyone keeps I
78:39 - gota I'll take a look at this later um
78:42 - okay so let me do a few things here let
78:43 - me first open up
78:46 - processing and um oh uh yes do want
78:51 - processing so I'm opening up processing
78:53 - I am going to I need like a short a
78:56 - short break here just sort of like
78:57 - mental break here so I'm going to uh
79:00 - clean the Whiteboard how's the light
79:03 - over here I'm just curious is the like
79:05 - can you see stuff on the Whiteboard does
79:07 - it seem like weird and
79:11 - shadowy I'm gonna clean this because I'm
79:14 - sure we'll need a
79:17 - diagram um you know some other topics
79:20 - that I've thought of that I really need
79:22 - to get to at some point are
79:25 - um how to deal with multi-dimensional
79:27 - arrays in JavaScript because it's really
79:30 - weird compared to how because Java array
79:32 - JavaScript arrays are these kind of like
79:33 - fungible flexible things um and so how
79:37 - to deal with that as opposed to like in
79:38 - processing your Java where it's much
79:41 - simpler another topic that's come up a
79:43 - lot recently that I want to get to and
79:46 - maybe I would do today I only I have
79:48 - about a half an hour left so I
79:49 - definitely need to uh I want to do today
79:51 - at some point is um how to deal with
79:53 - optional arguments to function in
79:55 - JavaScript have I done that before I
79:57 - don't think so okay so do I have
79:59 - processing open now I do oh I should get
80:02 - the update what am I in 3.1 there's a
80:03 - 3.1 and there's also now a 3.1.1 which
80:06 - actually had some key critical bug fixes
80:08 - in it but I'm I think I'm just going to
80:11 - uh to save time right now I'm not going
80:12 - to download the new the newer version
80:14 - I'll do it afterwards so I'm going to go
80:16 - to
80:18 - um
80:20 - uh
80:21 - Hollow so um hollow hollow Hol Hollow is
80:25 - a um creative coding magazine that's
80:28 - coming out soon and I did some images
80:29 - for them and one of them was reaction
80:31 - diffusion so let me open this up and let
80:34 - me run
80:35 - this okay so this is my existing example
80:38 - that I made a little over a year ago
80:40 - that is doing the reaction diffusion
80:43 - algorithm and you can see that okay so
80:45 - what's going on here is that there is a
80:51 - window it's a grid of pixels those
80:54 - pixels have a grayscale color and
80:56 - they're colored according to an
80:59 - algorithm that algorithm being this
81:01 - reaction diffusion algorithm so um now
81:05 - the way that the what this what this is
81:07 - like is you can think of let's say this
81:09 - table is my processing window and I I
81:12 - have some sort of chemical a in here so
81:15 - I'm going to pour chemical a onto the
81:17 - table and maybe the table is filled with
81:19 - chemical B so reaction diffusion refers
81:23 - to
81:25 - the reaction between those chemicals and
81:27 - how like chemical a also diffuses so
81:31 - which how is chemical a taking over is B
81:33 - taking over or is a kind of going away
81:35 - and dying or is B going away and dying
81:37 - so and you can really think of it almost
81:39 - as just like one if there's a lot of
81:40 - chemical a we have black if there's no
81:42 - chemical a we have white and if there's
81:44 - some amount in between we have grayscale
81:46 - and you can see that this particular
81:48 - kind of chemical reaction simulation
81:50 - creates these kind of Labyrinthian like
81:53 - um images
81:55 - and so this is like incredibly the sort
81:57 - of like Drop Dead standard classic
81:59 - result but you can modify this to have
82:02 - it behave in different ways how do you
82:03 - you know uh you could seed it again with
82:06 - the Contours of a human body to create
82:08 - this sort of like portrait of somebody
82:09 - you could alter the color in different
82:11 - ways so my hope for you if I can get
82:13 - this tutorial done is that you can
82:16 - um uh find creative twists off this
82:19 - algorithm but for me I'm going to just
82:20 - sort of do the sort of classic
82:22 - one um Okay so so let's look so I this
82:26 - says written entire whenever I did this
82:28 - over a year ago written entirely based
82:29 - on this so let's go to this
82:32 - URL and let's read over this URL to help
82:36 - um jog my
82:38 - memory and uh let's see if it matches
82:40 - with what I had just sort of said so let
82:42 - me make this a bit bigger reaction
82:44 - diffusion tutorial this is great thank
82:46 - you Carl Sims for this page that I'm now
82:48 - using in this video tutorial a
82:50 - simulation of two virtual chemicals
82:52 - reacting and diffusing on a 2d grid
82:54 - using the gray Scott model okay so
82:56 - that's an important thing that I should
82:57 - mention this idea of reaction diffusion
83:00 - is totally generic this idea of chemical
83:04 - a being fed in at some rate so there's a
83:07 - feed rate that's a key concept um B's
83:10 - get converted into a if B reproduces
83:13 - using a as food so chemical B is removed
83:16 - at a kill rate so this sort of like feed
83:18 - and conversion is the reaction and the
83:20 - kill rate the sort is the kind of
83:23 - diffusion um and so there are different
83:25 - models give different kind of chemicals
83:27 - that'll produce different kind of
83:28 - results one of them being gray Scott
83:30 - which I assume is named for some people
83:32 - with the names gray Scott and we could
83:33 - go read about that I'm assume we get
83:35 - further along there might be more of the
83:36 - formula okay so diffusion refers to both
83:40 - chemicals diffuse so uneven
83:42 - concentration spread out across the grid
83:44 - so this is really by the way a cellular
83:46 - automata simulation because it's a grid
83:48 - each cell having a state the state you
83:51 - know if you looked at some of my other
83:52 - videos about cellular automata like the
83:54 - states are zero or one white or black
83:56 - and we get these kind of nice patterns
83:57 - here it's a kind of state That's a Some
84:00 - number between zero a floating Point
84:01 - number between zero and one so um how
84:04 - much of chemical a how much of chemical
84:06 - B um okay the system is approximated by
84:10 - using two numbers at each grid cell so
84:13 - you can see here that there is some
84:15 - amount of chemical a and some amount of
84:17 - chemical B and we'll kind of normalize
84:19 - those values between zero and
84:21 - one and when a grid of thousand of cells
84:24 - ass simulated larger patterns emerge and
84:27 - you can see here that the color the
84:29 - amount of yellow the amount of blue is
84:30 - probably being determined based on the
84:32 - amount of A or B uh I'm
84:35 - looking um to see if there are any
84:37 - questions okay so ah this is where we
84:39 - get to the sad
84:42 - place okay let's everybody take a deep
84:47 - breath oh
84:54 - okay we're gonna look at this thing
84:55 - called the lassan formula and we're
84:57 - gonna just everything's G to be okay I
85:00 - don't remember it I understood this at
85:01 - one point hopefully it's my brain is
85:03 - going to come
85:04 - back so the grid is repeatedly updated
85:07 - using the following equations to update
85:10 - the concentrations of A and B in each
85:12 - cell and model the behaviors described
85:15 - above okay so here's the thing so what
85:19 - we need to do and let's use the
85:21 - Whiteboard for a second is let's think
85:23 - about what it means means to be a given
85:25 - cell I'm going to by the way I'm going
85:26 - to do this all again just uh I'm kind of
85:29 - like warming up to it and then I'm going
85:31 - to like record
85:33 - it uh so let's say we have a given
85:37 - cell and it has some concentration of a
85:41 - and some concentration of B oh sorry
85:43 - some concentration of B and we have
85:46 - moments in time we have time zero time
85:49 - one time two so has some concentation of
85:52 - a at Time Zero come some of B at time
85:55 - zero so what we need to figure out how
85:56 - to do is calculate the concentration of
85:59 - a oops
86:03 - sorry at time one and this is going to
86:06 - be I can't believe I'm about to use some
86:07 - sort of math notation here because I
86:08 - generally try to avoid that and I'm
86:10 - afraid of that it's going to be a
86:11 - function of the concentrations of those
86:14 - chemicals at um at time zero so this
86:20 - cell's new concentration of A and B is
86:23 - some for formula some mathematical thing
86:25 - that we're going to put our code of the
86:27 - previous generation so we have this idea
86:28 - of generations um frame by frame by
86:31 - frame that's why you're seeing this kind
86:32 - of spreading out now there's more to it
86:34 - than this though because I'm pretty sure
86:36 - and this is where the lassan stuff comes
86:38 - in
86:40 - that we also have this thing where this
86:43 - cell that I'm talking about here is like
86:45 - this cell here that lives on a grid so
86:47 - not only is it a function of its own
86:50 - previous chemical state but it's also a
86:52 - function of the chemical states of the
86:55 - neighbors around it because all of these
86:56 - chemicals are moving and combining as
86:58 - sort of neighboring ways so that's what
87:00 - we need to figure out how to
87:02 - solve okay so um so this we can
87:06 - understand this formula now the new
87:08 - values are equal to the old values
87:11 - plus d so those are diffusion rates
87:14 - those are going to be constants numbers
87:16 - we make up now these are 2D laian
87:19 - functions which give the difference
87:21 - between the average of nearby grid cells
87:24 - and the cell okay we can handle that two
87:28 - D Lan functions would give the
87:30 - difference between the average of nearby
87:32 - grid cells in this cell so what does
87:34 - that
87:38 - mean all right here's my grid let's just
87:41 - think about
87:43 - a let's say the cell that we're on has
87:45 - like an a value of
87:47 - 0.2 and this has like 7 and 0.9 and 0.1
87:51 - and 3 and one and zero and z and zero
87:54 - so conceivably what this means is let's
87:56 - add up all of these
87:59 - neighbors and then 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and
88:02 - then divide by eight so we want to get
88:04 - the average of the neighbors and then
88:06 - have take that minus the current and
88:10 - that's the that's the difference the
88:11 - Lelo function the difference between the
88:13 - average of the neighbors and the center
88:14 - which makes sense it has to do with like
88:16 - what's the chemical reaction is based on
88:18 - my I'm a cell what's my uh amount of
88:22 - chemicals and what's happening in my my
88:24 - neighbors and what's the difference
88:25 - between those two things is going to
88:26 - cause a reaction so I think we can put
88:28 - that and then back here a * b ^ 2 we see
88:33 - that this is the same this is the just
88:35 - the current and then plus F now what's
88:38 - f f is a feed rate so that's also some
88:42 - constant that we're going to put in and
88:44 - then uh K is the kill rate which is also
88:48 - some constant that we're going to put in
88:50 - and then uh and this is the reaction but
88:52 - it's really just this formula
88:54 - um and that's really it and then delta
88:56 - T so this is really key delta T again
89:00 - this goes back to something I was
89:01 - talking about earlier which is what's
89:04 - the unit of time right from one moment
89:07 - to the next and for us that's really
89:09 - every
89:10 - frame um every frame of Animation 160
89:13 - every 160th of a second so I think we
89:16 - can get this formula in our
89:18 - code so and then uh and then you can see
89:21 - here here are some typical values so
89:23 - these are the typical diffusion rates
89:25 - here's a typ typical feed rate here's a
89:28 - typical kill rate so you can see the
89:31 - these are probably the rates that I'm
89:32 - using in my code and uh and then the
89:35 - lassan is performed with a 3X3
89:37 - convolution 3x3 convolution that
89:41 - is this thing over here 3x3 my phone is
89:45 - buzzing oh is is the audio no the audio
89:47 - is still working okay I got whenever I
89:49 - start to hear my phone buzzing a lot in
89:51 - the past that's meant
89:54 - that
89:56 - um that's meant that
90:01 - um uh that's meant that something went
90:04 - wrong but uh nothing seems to have gone
90:06 - wrong now by the
90:07 - way um maybe I was in okay so the
90:11 - convolution center weight in negative
90:14 - one adjacent neighbors 02 oh interesting
90:16 - and diagonals 0. five so one thing it's
90:18 - saying here about this
90:20 - okay oh
90:22 - world oh life you are you are ever so
90:25 - more complicated than you seem to be
90:28 - we're we're going to be able to do this
90:29 - though um so let's talk about what a
90:32 - convolution is for a second because this
90:34 - is actually this is how things work in
90:35 - image processing so um let's think about
90:38 - this for a second a 3X3 Matrix is
90:43 - here and a convolution is an operation
90:47 - where you take every single value in
90:50 - this entire
90:51 - Matrix apply a weight to it multiply by
90:54 - a weight add them all together to get a
90:56 - new value for that
90:58 - Center let me try this side for this
91:00 - Center oh that's better for this Center
91:03 - uh element so let's say you're doing
91:06 - image processing and you're doing a
91:08 - blur the weight for each one of these
91:11 - would be one nth because you're taking
91:12 - an average there's nine cells and you
91:15 - want one nth of each or add them all
91:17 - together divide by nine get the average
91:19 - a sharpening filter would be like a
91:22 - negative weight to the center and
91:24 - positive weights to the outside because
91:25 - you want a pixel to be more different
91:27 - than its neighbors a blur you want to be
91:29 - more similar to its neighbors so this
91:31 - same type of operation is used here it's
91:32 - a convolution and what it's saying is if
91:35 - I go back
91:36 - here that the weights are where did it
91:39 - have it
91:40 - um uh Center weight is netive one
91:43 - meaning we're doing the difference we're
91:45 - subtracting out the center adjacent
91:46 - neighbors 02 and diagonals 05 so that
91:51 - means we give
91:55 - 2 2 2
91:59 - 2
92:01 - 05
92:03 - 0.05
92:05 - 0.05 0.05 and then the center is
92:08 - negative 1 so those are the weights so
92:11 - we take the chem the amount of a here
92:14 - and multiply it by that the amount of a
92:16 - here and multiply by that the amount of
92:17 - a here and multiply and add everything
92:18 - together now interestingly enough I hope
92:21 - and I'm almost sure that these will all
92:23 - add up to one right um add up to zero
92:28 - actually so 2 plus 2 plus 2 plus2 that's
92:31 - 08 right and then this plus this is 0.1
92:36 - plus this plus this is 0. 2 so we get
92:38 - one and then negative 1 is the center so
92:40 - we get zero so all of these together
92:43 - those weights all add up to zero which
92:45 - makes a lot of sense perfect okay so
92:47 - that's what this lloan function is going
92:49 - to
92:50 - do uh and that's really it and then it's
92:53 - just a matter of figuring out how to
92:54 - color the cells based on the amount of a
92:56 - chemical and you can be pretty creative
92:58 - with that and um so and you can see here
93:03 - through this page I encourage you to
93:04 - continue and look uh at how you can get
93:06 - these sort of different patterns okay
93:08 - deep breath here so I think I I now have
93:11 - a sense of this and I'm curious what
93:13 - your questions are um and then we're
93:17 - going to then I'm going to kind of do
93:18 - this again but kind of gloss over some
93:19 - of these details a bit more and just get
93:21 - to the programming but let's look at the
93:22 - processing version
93:25 - um which by the way you can see what it
93:27 - ended up with now um and let's look at
93:29 - the code for a second just to see how I
93:30 - did it oh dear Deary me okay so there's
93:35 - so many different ways you could do this
93:38 - um so I have made a two-dimensional
93:41 - array which is the grid and I need two
93:43 - of them because I want to store the
93:46 - previous generation of chemical values
93:49 - as I'm calculating the next so I have
93:51 - this snapshot of what the screen looks
93:52 - like now and I'm filling in all the new
93:54 - values in the next one and then I update
93:56 - the window with the next one and then I
93:57 - kind of Swap and make the old array the
93:59 - next one that sort of thing so I have
94:01 - two and then uh each one of these things
94:05 - gets to be a a cell object so the cell
94:09 - object is actually just an amount of
94:11 - chemical a and chemical B so in jav I'm
94:14 - going to do this in JavaScript I think
94:16 - um I don't know how slow it's going to
94:17 - be we'll find out um but this is such a
94:20 - simple object I won't even need to do
94:22 - this whole like class thing that'll be
94:23 - nice now here we can see look at this
94:25 - these are those constants I'm using that
94:26 - came directly from Carl Sims page I've
94:29 - got the diffusion rate for a the
94:31 - diffusion rate for B the feed rate and
94:33 - the kill rate so these are just constant
94:35 - values and you can see like what happens
94:37 - if I so if I run
94:39 - this you can see that uh this is it
94:43 - running but like I could just be like
94:44 - hey let's change the feed rate to that
94:47 - and you can see like nothing happens so
94:49 - there are sort of like known values that
94:51 - will do certain things and a lot of them
94:52 - probably just tend towards nothing and
94:54 - then here in update uh one thing I'm
94:56 - doing is skipping the edges so that's
94:58 - like kind of a simple way of doing stuff
95:00 - and then I I have to look at the
95:03 - previous um in order to get the new one
95:06 - and then I get the previous values now
95:07 - I'm doing boy am I doing this in a silly
95:09 - way but this works so this is that llas
95:12 - function I take all of the neighbors and
95:15 - I'm not I could do like a nested Loop
95:17 - here which would be much smarter but
95:18 - this is very explicit where I'm saying
95:20 - add the center value time ne1 I + 1 is
95:23 - the one on the right times 0 2 IUS one
95:25 - is the one on the left time 0 2 so I add
95:27 - those all up then I add up all the B's
95:30 - and then I do this exact formula so this
95:32 - is the exact formula that is whoops that
95:35 - is written right here it's here and by
95:38 - the way this is my unit of time one what
95:41 - happens if I increase the unit of
95:44 - time woo wacky what happens if I
95:48 - decrease the unit of
95:51 - time just probably the same thing but my
95:53 - much slower maybe anyway uh and then I'm
95:58 - doing then I then I
96:00 - um this is my fudge Factor I'm just kind
96:02 - of constraining the values between zero
96:04 - and one in case they go off and then I'm
96:07 - just drawing and I'm setting each pixels
96:09 - to a
96:11 - color which is based on a minus B * 255
96:16 - that's weird why a minus
96:19 - B uh interesting um I I think I just
96:23 - like probably picked that arbitrarily is
96:25 - a always greater than oh because if it's
96:28 - Le if that's less than zero it'll just
96:30 - be black um yeah so anyway but I could
96:33 - do like B minus
96:36 - a and that's the
96:38 - opposite I could just do
96:41 - a that's the amount of a so anyway so
96:44 - how you do the coloring I I don't
96:45 - remember I must have come up with that
96:46 - or I got it from somebody else okay so
96:48 - that's the idea I think I'm ready for
96:49 - this now so uh I'm going to I need to
96:51 - take like a two minute kind of just like
96:53 - headspace
96:55 - Break um to get it set up for this um
96:59 - and uh I see some people asking about 3D
97:01 - which is interesting um and then so I'm
97:04 - going to get set up to do this example
97:06 - oh one thing I have to figure out like
97:07 - why do I have this pattern so what did I
97:09 - do at the
97:10 - beginning at the
97:15 - beginning uh ah I picked 10 random
97:21 - spots to give a starting amount of B so
97:26 - they all start with one zero so
97:28 - everything starts with full chemical a
97:31 - and then I add chemical b in a bunch of
97:33 - different spots 10 random spots so
97:35 - that's that's useful to see as well um
97:38 - okay so that I think everything's here
97:41 - so um okay so I'm gonna sort of uh pause
97:44 - for a moment um not pause I mean I'm
97:46 - still going to be here but I'm going to
97:48 - check I'm going recycle the cameras I'm
97:49 - going to check to make sure the
97:50 - microphone batteries are still working
97:51 - I'm going to drink a little water I'm
97:53 - going to get get my p5js setup going um
97:56 - and etc etc so give me a minute here
97:59 - I'll leave this
98:01 - minimized Talk Amongst yourselves I'm
98:03 - starting to feel a little this is bad to
98:05 - do the coding challenge it's 12:48 the
98:07 - very end I should have done this at the
98:09 - beginning because I I feel a little
98:10 - brain dead right now but we'll see how
98:13 - this goes okay so I'm going to close all
98:17 - this um let me close this um let
98:22 - me do you hear that stomach Rowling
98:25 - sound uh let me
98:29 - uh what I'm actually going to do right
98:32 - now is I'm just going to go to just to
98:34 - make sure I have the most recent p5js
98:38 - I'm going to do
98:41 - this and it should come with uh if I
98:45 - download it it should come with this
98:46 - thing called empty example which I'm
98:49 - going to put onto the
98:50 - desktop and I'm going to call this
98:55 - um reaction
98:59 - diffusion and I'm going to minimize
99:03 - this and I think I'm going to use should
99:06 - I use adom
99:07 - or I'm either gonna use adom or Sublime
99:10 - a little more comfortable with Sublime
99:12 - Text but I've been trying to use Adam
99:13 - more recently I'm going to use Sublime
99:14 - just because I'm a little more
99:15 - comfortable with
99:16 - it uh and
99:21 - um the best way to get comfortable atam
99:23 - to use it I'm going
99:25 - to desktop desktop desktop reaction
99:29 - diffusion whoops reaction diffusion open
99:32 - okay so now I need sketch. JS
99:35 - perfect uh now I need to run a little
99:37 - local
99:38 - server I'm going to just run this in
99:42 - Chrome
99:46 - uh uh so let me open up terminal if
99:49 - you're wondering what I'm doing right
99:51 - now I do have a video tutorial about
99:52 - this which is uh a way of let me make
99:58 - this uh bigger for you guys so you can
99:59 - at least see what I'm doing uh a way of
100:03 - running a local python server on your
100:05 - machine to do um local
100:08 - development uh and I want so now I need
100:10 - to go to the
100:12 - desktop and reaction and do
100:15 - python
100:17 - DM a simple HTTP server
100:23 - so I should be able to minimize this
100:25 - now and do Local
100:29 - Host and open up the
100:31 - console that doesn't
100:33 - matter that would go away it went away
100:36 - and then if I say create canvas 400 400
100:42 - I'm also going to say pixel density one
100:45 - I'm just going to add this in here I'll
100:47 - mention Y in a second background
100:51 - 51 great
100:55 - um okay uh okay so now I'm ready this is
100:58 - let me let me do it lower resolution
101:01 - because I I'm just concerned about speed
101:04 - because I can always oops I can always
101:06 - do
101:08 - this okay and then I think that's
101:13 - good I think I'm ready to program this
101:16 - from scratch which is a little bit scary
101:18 - but I think I'm gonna do
101:20 - it okay um
101:25 - um people are asking to send Pizza by
101:28 - the way I don't I don't eat pizza I'm
101:30 - non-dairy I'm lactose intolerant don't
101:33 - don't say anything it's very kind of you
101:35 - um just if you want to do something nice
101:36 - spread the word uh you can you can
101:38 - support my patreon when I start that up
101:41 - um but it was nice of people okay so I'm
101:43 - checking okay so this microphone only
101:45 - has two bars which concerns me a little
101:47 - bit this one has two bars as well okay
101:50 - I'm gonna um I'm going to mute sound for
101:52 - a second um because I don't want to blow
101:54 - out your ears so I'm about to mute sound
101:56 - I'm going to replace the batteries
102:22 - here e
103:02 - test test test I think I'm back but it's
103:04 - so much cooler in the other room it's
103:06 - very hot in here but I'm coming to a
103:08 - close today I'm at an hour and 45
103:10 - minutes this is probably going to take a
103:14 - half an hour although I you know I
103:16 - really want these videos when I do these
103:18 - sort of like short nugget algorithm
103:20 - videos I really want them to be less
103:21 - than 20 minutes so we'll see see how
103:23 - that goes
103:27 - um I'm going to um clean this whiteboard
103:33 - again I will probably draw some of the
103:35 - similar
103:51 - diagram okay
103:57 - okay so let me get now this pen is the
104:02 - good one the good
104:04 - side
104:06 - um come back over
104:08 - here it's amazing that I haven't had to
104:10 - pee this whole time I always have to pee
104:12 - in the middle of these but somehow even
104:13 - I'm drinking all this tea I said that
104:15 - I'm totally gonna have to
104:20 - go okay um
104:30 - okay I think I'm ready now so what I
104:32 - need is also uh this I can close this I
104:37 - can close this I can close I need that
104:39 - Carl Sims
104:40 - link
104:42 - um right I was just there here it
104:46 - is
104:49 - okay uh oh yeah one thing I wanted to
104:51 - look up was Grays Scott I I wanted to
104:52 - just just understand the I mean I might
104:54 - not mention this but I wanted to get the
104:58 - sort of
105:00 - historical
105:02 - um the his historical origin of the gray
105:08 - Scott but oh there's some interesting
105:10 - other this is a nice way to look at the
105:12 - formula as well
105:15 - um this doesn't seem to be coming up
105:18 - with
105:19 - anything uh here we go
105:27 - well I'll look this up later not doesn't
105:30 - really matter well so this is
105:32 - interesting you can see different ways
105:33 - of coloring stuff and different other
105:35 - models I I hope that people do some nice
105:37 - variations of this you could do this in
105:39 - like webg and shaders all sort of fancy
105:41 - way we're just going to do the very
105:42 - basics in p5js oh great Scott yes coding
105:46 - challenge okay F Al here we go everybody
105:50 - let me cycle yeah I know the elevator
105:52 - music I got to get the sound system
105:54 - going in here um that's really you know
105:58 - one of my
105:59 - issues is that I whenever I have time I
106:04 - just want to like record more videos but
106:06 - I need just a day where I do things like
106:09 - get organized get the connect set up get
106:10 - the Raspberry Pi set up to be able to
106:12 - use those in the videos I need to spend
106:14 - a day like getting the sound system in
106:15 - here working better but such is life um
106:18 - hopefully I'm going to have some more
106:20 - time now that it is uh the end of May
106:22 - and June is coming up um jury duty is
106:26 - going to be a problem
106:27 - though okay uh all right here we go um
106:32 - reaction diffusion gray Scott model
106:36 - we're gonna do this in 15 to 20 minutes
106:39 - and then I'm going to say good night and
106:40 - goodbye or good afternoon good morning
106:42 - whatever time it is some of you if
106:44 - you're watching this must be getting to
106:45 - the evening if you're in Europe if you
106:48 - are you you probably can't watch this
106:49 - unless you're on a VPN in China but it
106:51 - would be 1:00 a.m. for you I just there
106:53 - I'm I think I'm over my jet lag though
106:55 - nobody cares about this okay uh so
106:58 - reaction diffusion
107:00 - oops Local
107:03 - Host we
107:05 - go and Sublime is
107:11 - up okay and here we go coding rainbow
107:17 - take one take two take three hi
107:20 - everybody okay
107:23 - mental note do the complicated algorithm
107:26 - coding challenge at the beginning next
107:28 - time okay I'm going to do this this is
107:30 - going to happen I don't need to press
107:31 - anything just need to start okay okay so
107:35 - if the
107:37 - um I'm gonna keep this chat kind of view
107:40 - open to see it in the corner of my eye
107:42 - if there's an audio problem or an issue
107:45 - um put like just like flood the chat
107:48 - with like tons of crazy emojis but don't
107:51 - do that otherwise
107:54 - that and I what I'm going to do is I'm
107:55 - gonna uh I'll actually make it much
107:59 - bigger this is going to be my new
108:03 - system oh actually no this is not
108:06 - working hold on comments
108:10 - below okay okay here we go so I I'm not
108:14 - looking the good news is I'm not looking
108:15 - at my video because that always
108:18 - distracts me I just see the chat there
108:21 - and um so if the sound goes bad oh okay
108:26 - well hold on before I start somebody is
108:27 - saying the mic seems a bit quiet can you
108:29 - all let me know I did just swap out the
108:32 - battery so it could have changed
108:33 - something oh you know what it is quite
108:35 - low compared to usual let me move this
108:38 - back up I'm making this louder just to
108:40 - warn you
108:41 - guys okay I I made okay so don't Emoji
108:45 - now okay is is everything fine is there
108:48 - any dist Distortion in the Audio I
108:50 - actually just turned it up because I I
108:52 - didn't realize I had it turned down
108:53 - quite a bit
108:55 - um yeah so I think it should be better
108:57 - now okay Mike is fine yes okay here we
109:00 - go
109:02 - everybody stret you know I was at this
109:04 - uh construction site yesterday and they
109:06 - had this poster of different stretches I
109:08 - think everybody take a moment and
109:09 - stretch stop and stretch gonna
109:17 - stretch the good news is I do these
109:19 - standing up so I feel like if I was like
109:20 - sitting down for like hours in these
109:22 - tutorials kind of like moving around a
109:24 - lot you should if you're watching
109:25 - sitting down you should stand up and
109:27 - move around for a little bit okay like
109:29 - let me let me fix my hair makeup
109:32 - makeup nobody's coming
109:35 - right where's my hair and makeup
109:37 - Department
109:43 - okay okay you have a standing desk okay
109:45 - I'm now I can really see by the way this
109:47 - is brilliant for what I just did with
109:48 - the chat I just zoomed in on and have
109:50 - like a huge font so I could just read it
109:52 - easily from over here I what I W really
109:54 - want to do is put the chat like up here
109:56 - so that I can look at the chat and still
109:57 - be kind of like looking at the camera
109:59 - because I kind of do this a lot okay I
110:01 - got to just do this here we
110:05 - go hello welcome to another coding
110:07 - challenge with me Dan okay in this
110:11 - today's coding challenge I'm going to
110:12 - look at the reaction diffusion algorithm
110:14 - it's a pixel-based algorithm that allows
110:17 - you to generate interesting patterns
110:18 - that look like up top and it's what it's
110:21 - uh uh what it's doing is it's modeling a
110:23 - chemical reaction so it's this idea of
110:26 - having in your
110:27 - canvas let me just start
110:30 - over kind of like what am I doing here
110:32 - at the beginning I kind of want I I want
110:34 - to have um I think what I would like to
110:37 - have
110:37 - open
110:40 - is did I I want to have this as a visual
110:44 - reference
110:45 - open
110:51 - yeah so I'm going to have this running
110:53 - right
110:54 - here
110:56 - okay oh it's going to run really slow in
110:58 - JavaScript I bet but we'll sort of see
111:00 - okay um so I'm going to put this here
111:05 - and I'll zoom in a little
111:10 - bit okay must have proper Opening screen
111:15 - okay here we go again
111:18 - everybody just I'm gonna do the camera
111:20 - one more time so I think I wasted so
111:22 - much time
111:24 - there I'm excited for this one
111:29 - okay make the same bad joke with me Dan
111:37 - whatever hello and welcome to another
111:39 - coding challenge uh in this coding
111:41 - challenge I am going to look at the
111:43 - reaction diffusion algorithm so I have a
111:45 - version of it running right over there
111:47 - that is a processing sketch that is
111:49 - implemented the reaction diffusion
111:50 - algorithm I'm going to implement it in
111:52 - Javas script uh do it from scratch in
111:54 - this video and you can see that this
111:56 - allows you to create this interesting
111:57 - kind of Labyrinthian uh uh visual in
112:00 - your canvas now there's a lot of
112:02 - different ways that you can apply colors
112:04 - and get different qualities to the image
112:06 - but I'm going to look at the sort of
112:07 - core classic reaction diffusion
112:09 - algorithm using the gray Scott model I
112:11 - will include some links below to
112:13 - reference Pages the one that I will
112:15 - build the code based on is right here in
112:17 - the browser the Carl Sims a Carl Sims
112:19 - tutorial page um and so the idea here is
112:23 - that I'm going to just sort of look at
112:24 - the drop dead simple classic algorithm
112:27 - black and white pixels only and then
112:28 - hopefully you after watching this and
112:30 - using the code might come up with some
112:31 - other creative uses and applications of
112:34 - it so let's try to understand first what
112:36 - this algorithm actually is and so I'm
112:37 - going to close this window out and look
112:39 - at this diagram so the idea of reaction
112:41 - diffusion is kind of like you have your
112:43 - screen and you're about to pour some
112:45 - chemicals into it and those chemicals
112:46 - are going to react and there's going to
112:48 - be a lot of chemical a and then less of
112:50 - chemical B and they're going to react
112:51 - and diffuse and that's ort of thing and
112:53 - then based on the how those chemicals
112:55 - are arranged in the screen in this sort
112:58 - of like dish petri dish of your canvas
113:00 - I'm going to we're going to set a color
113:02 - so if there's a lot of chemical a we're
113:03 - going to make the pixel black if there's
113:05 - no chemical a we're going to make the
113:06 - pixel white and kind of everywhere in
113:08 - between so that's the idea here now
113:10 - there are a lot of different um kind of
113:12 - key pieces here and let's just look at
113:14 - this quick diagram here thank you again
113:16 - Carl Sims for providing the diagrams for
113:18 - this video um chemical a so um the way
113:21 - it's going to work is the canvas is
113:23 - going to be filled with chemical B and
113:25 - then we're going to start to pour
113:26 - chemical a into the canvas the reaction
113:30 - aspect is chemical A and B reacting and
113:32 - maybe a is turning into B and the sort
113:35 - of diffusion in this way is that
113:36 - chemical B is also going to get kind of
113:38 - like removed uh from it so there are
113:41 - some there are some key constants in the
113:43 - system that are numbers that you're
113:44 - going to see in the code one is the feed
113:46 - rate which is how fast are we pouring in
113:48 - chemical a and then another is called
113:50 - the kill rate I wish there was a nicer
113:52 - name for that but that's what it's
113:53 - called which is how what is the rate the
113:55 - chemical B is being removed so this is
113:58 - the idea now um so and you can see here
114:02 - what we're going to do is each each cell
114:05 - is going to have a certain amount of
114:06 - chemical a and amount of chemical B and
114:08 - those values are going to have a range
114:10 - between zero and one uh one being a lot
114:13 - of chemical a zero being none and then
114:15 - that amount is going to be used to set
114:17 - the color for a pixel and so you can see
114:19 - here uh how this how this kind of works
114:22 - we're going to all this in code now how
114:24 - look at this now we have this like
114:26 - terrifyingly scary looking formula but
114:29 - we can tackle this formula I'm gonna
114:31 - right here I'm here with you to tackle
114:34 - this complicated looking formula so
114:36 - let's put putting that aside let's kind
114:37 - of make a quick diagram so the way that
114:40 - I'm going to build this in code is I'm
114:42 - going to have a two-dimensional array
114:45 - meaning I'm going to have a data
114:47 - structure that's going to keep track of
114:50 - uh each spot in that data structure is
114:52 - going to keep track of an individual
114:54 - cell call that a cell each cell is going
114:57 - to have an amount of chemical a and an
115:00 - amount of chemical B so what I need to
115:03 - do is understand uh if CH if there are
115:07 - moments in time there are Generations
115:09 - This Moment In Time next moment in time
115:10 - so Moment In Time a z moment in time b0
115:14 - what I need to understand is how do I
115:15 - get the amount of a for Moment In Time
115:18 - One based on some function of the amount
115:22 - of of a and the amount of B at time zero
115:25 - so this is what we're looking at and in
115:26 - fact over here that's what this formula
115:29 - is showing you the new value of a equals
115:32 - all this stuff based on the previous
115:33 - value of a and b and some other
115:34 - constants so this is what we need to do
115:37 - but there's a bit more to it than this
115:39 - so you know I could say like oh A1
115:42 - equals the average of a0 plus b 0 you
115:46 - know divided by two this could be our
115:47 - formula this would be a lot easier to
115:48 - implement so that formula is just like
115:50 - this but a lot more compliment
115:52 - complicated so now but there the reason
115:55 - why there's more to it than this is
115:56 - because we have this scenario here of an
115:58 - individual cell we have to apply
116:00 - something called a
116:03 - convolution you're going to see I'm
116:05 - going to show you in a moment it says a
116:06 - convolution of a 3X3
116:09 - Matrix all this scary sounding stuff so
116:12 - here is a 3X3 Matrix and this is a given
116:16 - cell and what I want to know is what is
116:20 - this
116:21 - cell's new values of A and B based on
116:24 - its previous value of a and b but not
116:27 - just it I need to know also based on its
116:31 - neighbors so these chemicals are
116:34 - reacting and combining in a given cell
116:37 - also with what are the chemicals next to
116:39 - it so the con a convolution means take
116:42 - every single one of these cells and
116:45 - multiply it by some weight so if I were
116:48 - blurring an image for example I could
116:50 - use a blur as blur meaning the average
116:53 - of a convolu of of a of a 3X3 Matrix of
116:56 - pixels so the new pixel color is going
116:58 - to be an average 1 nth of this color
117:00 - plus 1 nth of this color plus 1 nth of
117:02 - this color plus one nth of this color so
117:03 - I take all of the colors and multiply
117:05 - them by 1 nth add them all together and
117:06 - I have the new color but we have a
117:08 - different um convolution here and it's
117:11 - described in in the diffusion uh in the
117:14 - reaction diffusion algorithm so this is
117:16 - the basic idea I need a two-dimensional
117:18 - array each spot is going to have a
117:20 - certain amount of a and a certain amount
117:21 - of B I need to have a formula that for
117:24 - each cycle each frame through draw I get
117:26 - a new value of a and a new value of B
117:28 - and then a new value of a and a new
117:29 - value of B and the math formula is going
117:31 - to be something like this but more
117:32 - complicated because it's also going to
117:34 - involve all the neighbors so let's start
117:36 - setting this up now hopefully this is
117:37 - the basic idea let's start setting it up
117:39 - to program it okay so now I'm back over
117:41 - here uh I am back over here ah oh was I
117:45 - not over there the whole time I think I
117:47 - was over there the whole time hopefully
117:48 - this was right uh somebody in the chat
117:50 - tell me was I in the on the Whiteboard
117:51 - while was showing that um okay so if I
117:54 - go back to I have this blank uh code
117:57 - here um and uh I'm going to go to my uh
118:02 - canvas here and this is my canvas so the
118:04 - first thing I need to do is create okay
118:06 - I was good the first thing I need to do
118:08 - is create my uh two-dimensional array to
118:12 - store all the amount the the amount of
118:14 - chemicals in each spot in the in the
118:16 - grid okay so two-dimensional arrays in
118:19 - JavaScript are kind of a funny thing uh
118:22 - not funny haha funny a little bit weird
118:25 - because um arrays in JavaScript there's
118:27 - just so many different ways you can make
118:28 - them but ultimately what a
118:29 - two-dimensional array is and let me kind
118:31 - of describe this to you briefly I'm
118:33 - going to make an array called grid and
118:35 - you could imagine like what if I did
118:37 - this um I'm gonna write something like
118:42 - this I'm just gonna kind of type
118:45 - something out for a second just to
118:46 - explain this
118:52 - this my friends you are my friends
118:55 - indeed is a two-dimensional
118:59 - array I I kind of space it out like a
119:02 - grid but really what it is is just an
119:03 - array of arrays to see how it's an array
119:06 - open square bracket and square bracket
119:08 - and then it's three arrays inside of it
119:11 - but I could but so really a
119:12 - two-dimensional array in programming is
119:14 - just an array of arrays so what I need
119:16 - is one array to keep an array for here
119:19 - for here for here for here right so I
119:21 - need the first array to be the first row
119:23 - the second array to be the second row
119:24 - the third array to be the third row that
119:26 - sort of thing but I I'm not going to
119:28 - type it out manually for 3x3 I could
119:30 - type it out manually what I need to do
119:32 - is kind of um is actually make it um uh
119:36 - make it in code okay everything's gonna
119:39 - be fine so I'm gonna create that
119:41 - variable and I'm gonna do it I'm gonna
119:42 - use a particular style I'm gonna do it
119:45 - different I'm gonna do it a different so
119:46 - what I'm going to do is I'm first just
119:47 - going to say grid is an array it's an
119:50 - empty array and what I need to do is I
119:52 - need to Loop xal 0 x is less than the
119:56 - width of this canvas and let me Zoom
119:57 - back out x++ so for every
120:00 - X and for every
120:06 - y right for every X ah stop oh I can't
120:14 - ah I'm waiting for my auto format that's
120:17 - not here um for every x what I need to
120:20 - do is say grid index X is an array so I
120:25 - start with this array and then I say hey
120:26 - let's make an array and
120:29 - then what am I going to put here grid
120:32 - XY equals now what do I what do I need
120:35 - in each spot in the grid now if I were
120:38 - just if I only had a single chemical if
120:40 - I only had a single chemical I was just
120:42 - putting a single number in each one of
120:43 - these but I have two chemicals I have an
120:44 - A and A B so let's actually I think this
120:46 - is a place where I could just make a
120:47 - literal JavaScript object and say a is
120:50 - you know there's zero of a and there is
120:53 - a zero of B so uh and you know I I don't
120:56 - think I need to be so long winded about
120:58 - it this is such a simple object I'm
121:00 - going to do this so I make each spot in
121:03 - the grid each spot in the grid for every
121:06 - X and every y there's an A and A B with
121:09 - zero of each chemical and I'm going to
121:10 - need to change that eventually but we're
121:11 - going to start there so this is good I
121:14 - now have my grid yay now here's the
121:17 - thing in order to make this work right
121:20 - the whole this whole is all all built on
121:23 - this idea of I need to get the Next
121:26 - Generation amount of a so I can't be me
121:31 - if this grid is the snapshot of all the
121:33 - chemicals in a current generation I need
121:36 - a completely separate
121:38 - grid to start filling in the new
121:42 - values because if I were to use the same
121:45 - grid if I start overwriting the values
121:47 - in that grid while I'm checking other
121:49 - values neighbors everything's going to
121:50 - get all messed up so
121:52 - what I should do is I'm also going to
121:54 - create a variable here called
121:57 - Next and I'm going to be kind of silly
122:00 - about it and I'm just going to make two
122:01 - of
122:04 - these and I'm going to
122:06 - say next so I now have two
122:10 - two-dimensional arrays and I think I
122:12 - just want to briefly
122:14 - mention that um I could have done this
122:19 - so grid is going to be the current and
122:21 - then next is going to be the next one so
122:23 - I could have done this by also using new
122:26 - array in JavaScript to create a sort of
122:27 - fixed size but I know my array should
122:29 - have a width and height as kind of the
122:31 - number of uh columns and rows okay so
122:33 - now we're in good shape so what I can do
122:36 - what I want to do is just sort of see
122:38 - that the basic idea of this is working
122:42 - so what I need to do is draw a color a
122:46 - pixel color in the window based on each
122:48 - value in that grid so by the way we're
122:50 - going to need this double double nested
122:52 - Loop like a zillion
122:54 - times so I'm going to just copy paste
122:56 - that down here and one one thing I'm
122:58 - going to do at the very end is I'm going
123:00 - to say load
123:01 - pixels and then I'm going to uh say
123:05 - update pixels and what I'm going to do
123:09 - is I'm going to uh create a
123:14 - color let's just make sure I'm going to
123:16 - just make a nice you know pinkish
123:18 - purplish color just to make sure this is
123:20 - working and I'm going to say pixel index
123:22 - oh boy so guess what everybody I have a
123:25 - whole video that goes through the pixel
123:27 - array I should link to that from here
123:28 - the pixel array in Java in p5js in the
123:31 - JavaScript canvas is a pixel array that
123:34 - has four spots for every pixel so I need
123:38 - to figure out and it's one-dimensional
123:40 - so I go through the derivation of this
123:42 - formula but I'm going to say pixal x + y
123:46 - times uh
123:49 - width Time 4 and then I'm going to say
123:52 - pixels pix
123:55 - plus 0 equals uh 255 and I'm going to
124:00 - this I don't need and I'm going to say
124:02 - zero and I'm GNA say 100 and then and
124:05 - this is uh one one two and three so what
124:09 - I've done here is I'm using a formula to
124:11 - find the right spot in that array for
124:13 - every single Pixel every width every
124:15 - column in every row and then I'm saying
124:17 - make its red 255 make its green zero
124:19 - make its blue 100 make its Alpha 2 55 so
124:22 - I just want to see that this runs okay
124:26 - great so I filled it with a color so I
124:28 - do have a way of setting every pixel
124:29 - color now what I want is for these
124:31 - colors to be based on the grid so I'm
124:34 - going to say grid X comma y. a and I'm
124:40 - going to say grid XY
124:43 - dob so um so I'm going to do the red and
124:46 - the blue as coming from the
124:48 - two-dimensional array itself and we
124:50 - should see all black but if I give
124:52 - everything a
124:54 - uh random
124:59 - amount we should see uh okay so what am
125:02 - I missing here so I gave the grid a
125:05 - random amount of a and a random amount
125:06 - of
125:07 - B and uh what's missing oh I I did a
125:13 - random between zero and one so I what I
125:15 - want to do is multiply these by 255
125:17 - there's there's lots of ways I could use
125:18 - color mode or get around this but I'm
125:20 - just going to multiply that by 255 oh
125:22 - and I'm gonna have to say floor because
125:24 - it has to be an integer I
125:26 - bet uh okay so I probably could have
125:28 - done a better job at this but there we
125:30 - go so you can see that this is working I
125:32 - have a mechanism by which based on the
125:35 - amount of chemicals I get a pixel color
125:37 - this is the core thing that we need so
125:40 - now all we need to do is say like okay
125:42 - let's put this formula
125:44 - in great so let's unpack this formula
125:47 - right because right now and and actually
125:49 - before we even do that let's let's
125:51 - actually just get the structure going so
125:54 - before I put the formula in let's do
125:56 - something let's put this nested Loop in
126:01 - again and what I want to say is now I
126:05 - need to use this next right
126:09 - next index XY equals and let me just do
126:13 - something like I'm going to make up a
126:15 - formula this isn't the actual reaction
126:17 - diffusion formula but what I'm going to
126:19 - do is where's the camera where's the
126:22 - screen I'm losing my mind I'm going to
126:23 - say grid X comma so
126:26 - next. a equals grid xy. a you know times
126:32 - 0.2
126:35 - and next the the next
126:39 - B is the grids B * 1.2 so I'm going to
126:44 - do that so this is this again this isn't
126:46 - the correct formula we're going to have
126:48 - to actually put in the reaction
126:50 - diffusion formula but I'm showing this
126:51 - this is the structure by which I say the
126:54 - next generation will be that so now if I
126:57 - run this again we come back to
126:59 - here well it doesn't seem to be
127:02 - animating or changing why so it's not
127:05 - animating or changing because I'm still
127:06 - drawing it based on grid so maybe what I
127:09 - actually want to do is draw the next
127:14 - one and I did get something strange
127:16 - happening here so it looks different and
127:19 - let's actually um
127:22 - not let it go o the values go over me so
127:25 - you can see that it is actually doing
127:27 - something like the values are different
127:30 - but importantly here I don't see
127:33 - anything animating so one of the major
127:35 - things that we need here is and let's
127:36 - think about is something called a swap
127:38 - are you with me are you still paying
127:40 - attention I would understand if you
127:42 - weren't okay so I need a
127:45 - swap
127:47 - so this is a very common technique in
127:49 - seller automata systems and other types
127:51 - of Generation by generation systems what
127:54 - I have here is I have oops wrong side of
127:57 - this marker what I have here is I have a
128:00 - two-dimensional array called grid and
128:03 - then I have one called
128:08 - next so grid is all my starting values
128:11 - then next is calculated and then next is
128:14 - drawn to the
128:16 - window well what should next should then
128:19 - become grid again so I can get a new
128:22 - next and draw that to the window so what
128:24 - I need to do is swap them what I need to
128:27 - do is say let me put next back into grid
128:30 - and then I have a new blank one to write
128:32 - on and I could just pull grid over there
128:33 - because it's the old one I don't need it
128:35 - anymore so if I if I want to have this
128:37 - continuous generation I have the old and
128:39 - the new so new gets calculated then new
128:42 - becomes old and I could just use that
128:44 - old one that I had to be the next new
128:45 - one and then new becomes old then then
128:47 - new gets calculated then new becomes old
128:49 - again so I need to have a swap so I'm
128:51 - actually going to write this as a
128:52 - separate function so at the end of every
128:54 - oops after I draw I'm going to call a
128:57 - function called Swap and I'm going to
128:59 - write that down can you see this I'm
129:01 - going to write this down oh somewhere
129:03 - down here so I'm going to write a
129:05 - function and called Swap and so what's
129:09 - going on here next I want grid to be
129:12 - next and I want next to be grid I want
129:16 - grid to be next and I want next to be
129:17 - grid I want to swap them oh but this is
129:19 - no good if grid is next and then next
129:22 - equals grid well then next is next
129:24 - because grid is next we've got a problem
129:26 - here so in a swap what I need to do is I
129:29 - need to have a temporary variable that
129:32 - keeps track of the old grid so now grid
129:35 - can become next and next can become that
129:38 - old grid temp so this is a very simple
129:40 - swapping algorithm to swap the values of
129:42 - two variables um and that'll do the
129:44 - trick for me so now if I swap them this
129:46 - will get applied over and over again so
129:49 - let's let's do 0. n and 08 just so we
129:51 - see something happening here and you can
129:53 - see it it went down to zero very quickly
129:56 - um and I could um you know I could say
129:58 - 0.95 and I could try doing
130:01 - 1.01 so you can see it's going towards
130:04 - it's going to go towards blue eventually
130:05 - so we can see we have the system going
130:07 - now again this isn't this is the like
130:10 - shiffman rainbow reaction diffusion
130:12 - algorithm which isn't very interesting
130:14 - at all so we have the guts here we have
130:16 - the foundation we have the
130:18 - two-dimensional array each spot holds
130:20 - the amount of each chemical the screen
130:22 - is colored based on those chemicals and
130:23 - I have some formula to calculate the new
130:25 - chemical value based on the old chemical
130:27 - value so I don't know how long I've been
130:29 - doing this for but we're so close now
130:31 - all I need to do is actually go and get
130:33 - that scary formula uh from that web page
130:36 - and stick it in the code and we're done
130:38 - so let's go take a look at that this is
130:40 - going to be a bit more difficult than I
130:42 - might have imagined but let's see how it
130:43 - let's see how it goes so now we're back
130:45 - to here so let's look at all of these
130:48 - things okay a the of the new a equals
130:53 - what a so let's start putting this in uh
130:55 - so this we can do difference of a equals
130:57 - new a so I'm going to go back and um I'm
131:01 - G to probably need a lot more space here
131:04 - so um and I'm just going to do a for a
131:06 - second the new a right equals
131:10 - what the old
131:15 - a now I'm going to go back to this
131:17 - formula
131:19 - plus plus now what da what is da
131:23 - oh I can't operate the computer
131:26 - sometimes I went back by accident da is
131:28 - a diffusion rate so where are those here
131:31 - we go these are some typical values so
131:33 - this is by the way is something that
131:34 - you're going to after you watch this
131:35 - video and use this example you're going
131:36 - to want to like play around with these
131:37 - values yourself or go look up other
131:39 - values the different values will produce
131:41 - different kind of results so diffusion
131:43 - rate of a is one so I'm going to in my
131:45 - code I'm going to make these uh Global
131:47 - variables da equals 1 let's see what
131:51 - else we got uh DB equals
131:53 - 0.5 diffusion rate for B the feed feed
131:57 - is how fast are you feeding in chemical
131:59 - a is
132:01 - 0.55 I'm going to call that feed just to
132:04 - because F can mean other stuff in
132:06 - programming
132:07 - 0.055 was that it yep and K is
132:12 - 0.062 uh our k equals
132:14 - 0.062 that's that's sort of the the the
132:17 - kill rate how how fast is a b being
132:20 - removed um so these are the values that
132:22 - I'm going to need in that particular
132:23 - formula so now I can go back here and
132:26 - say uh plus the diffusion rate of a
132:31 - times La PL upside down triangle PL 2D
132:36 - function okay so let's let's make that
132:38 - something temporarily that we're going
132:39 - to deal with in a little bit so I'm just
132:42 - going to say right now I'm going to say
132:44 - la
132:45 - plus I'm going to make that a function
132:48 - La PL a we're going to deal with that
132:50 - later
132:52 - and uh times
132:55 - a times and you know what I should do to
132:58 - make this shorter I think something that
133:00 - can make things a little easier is I can
133:01 - say a
133:02 - equals grid XY a so that way I don't
133:06 - have to every time I need that a value I
133:08 - can just put a time a
133:11 - times uh uh oh no
133:15 - minus minus what a * b^ 2
133:21 - uh so a * B * B and I'm going to I need
133:26 - a variable for a boy this is a lot of
133:28 - typing here guess you could fast forward
133:30 - now or put this on two times speed if
133:32 - you're watching this still uh I kind of
133:34 - want to like put this on multiple
133:37 - lines also just so you can see it so uh
133:40 - whoops no this should be here I'm going
133:43 - to do each piece of this formula on a
133:45 - different
133:45 - line uh I don't know if this is making
133:48 - it uh um a minus
133:52 - a * B * so we have a * the diffusion of
133:56 - a plus this lla thing I have to get to
133:58 - time a minus a * B * B and then now we
134:02 - have plus the feed multiplied by 1us a
134:08 - so plus the feed multiplied by 1 minus
134:14 - a did I get that right plus the feed
134:17 - multipli by 1 minus a and I'm going to
134:19 - put parentheses around these things I
134:21 - think I'm sure it's right anyway but
134:24 - this I think will help us a plus d a
134:27 - that doesn't seem right A Plus da times
134:30 - llas so I I so I'm gonna um just to be
134:33 - consistent here I'm G to move this down
134:36 - here and uh I think I now have all the
134:40 - components of that formula a plus da
134:42 - time LL time a minus a * B * B plus feed
134:48 - * 1 - A does that look right somebody
134:50 - watching this in the live stream will
134:52 - correct me I think I've gotten this
134:54 - right um and we will uh yeah da lass
134:59 - time a okay so hopefully I got this
135:01 - right I have to do the same thing for B
135:02 - why not just do it right now that we're
135:04 - here so B is B plus uh the the diffusion
135:11 - rate for
135:12 - B and I'm going to make a lass B
135:15 - function which is a little bit silly
135:16 - what I'm doing here but I'm going to do
135:18 - it anyway um uh times B
135:22 - and then it is plus ab^
135:25 - 2 plus ab^ 2
135:30 - minus uh
135:33 - minus k + f *
135:36 - B K plus feed
135:40 - times B okay we're in good shape here I
135:46 - put parentheses around this just to be
135:48 - consistent so I think I now have um so I
135:52 - think I now have these formas now I I
135:54 - did miss a crucial
135:55 - point if you come back to this you'll
135:58 - see delta T delta T is the change in
136:02 - time for each iteration what does that
136:05 - mean well the way the world works is
136:08 - that Time Marches forward on and on and
136:11 - on the way that computer programs and
136:13 - animation programs work is Time Marches
136:17 - forward in time steps lock step and how
136:20 - and we're doing this calculation in this
136:22 - sort of like stop calculate Weight stop
136:24 - calculate Weight stop calculate so we
136:27 - can sort of scale the amount of time
136:29 - that's passing scale the calculation
136:31 - according to I'm going to leave that as
136:32 - one and basically my time scale is going
136:34 - to be the 60 frames per second that I
136:37 - hope that the um that the uh algorithm
136:41 - uh that I hope that the animation plays
136:42 - out at but you can really sort of change
136:44 - the quality of what you're getting and
136:45 - the degree of accuracy that you're
136:46 - getting by having a smaller time step so
136:48 - you might try 0.1 015 and see what you
136:51 - get but I'm going to kind of just leave
136:52 - that out for right now for the for the
136:54 - case of Simplicity Okay so we've done
136:57 - everything now except for this leian
136:59 - thing and so I'm realizing by the way
137:02 - that this is leian a this is not
137:04 - multiply by a this is the lassan a thing
137:07 - so one thing I can do is get rid of this
137:08 - times a and this times B um so what is
137:13 - that this is the convolution so this is
137:16 - this particular thing what I need to do
137:18 - in the lass function is look at the
137:21 - every single amount of a in all of the
137:24 - neighbors I need to multiply a weight
137:27 - and then add them all together to get
137:29 - the new value that's the Lan function
137:32 - the convolution so if we go back here
137:34 - let's go back to this page and here it
137:38 - says um the leian is performed with a
137:42 - three now there's different ways you
137:43 - could do this but this says with a 3 by3
137:45 - convolution with a center weight of
137:47 - negative-1 adjacent neighbors 2 and and
137:51 - diagonals .5 this means the following so
137:54 - I need to in this
137:57 - function look at every single cell and
138:00 - apply a weight
138:04 - 0.52
138:06 - 052 Point uh this is the center one
138:09 - negative 1 and then 2 05 2 05 the
138:15 - diagonals get a weight of 05 the
138:17 - adjacents get a weight of 0 2 and the
138:19 - center gets a weight of negative 1 we're
138:21 - trying to determine the difference
138:23 - between that Center cell and its
138:26 - neighbors and you notice it's in a way
138:28 - these have higher weights because it's
138:29 - like the adjacent ones are closer to it
138:31 - than the diagonals so those chemicals
138:33 - are going to play a larger role in the
138:34 - reaction you could try messing around
138:36 - with different values now there are all
138:37 - sorts of fancy ways I could write
138:39 - another nested Loop and kind of use some
138:41 - sort of other two-dimensional array to
138:43 - keep track of the weights I probably
138:45 - should do that but I'm going to be a
138:46 - little bit lazy right now and just do
138:48 - this in a very hard-coded manual way
138:51 - so let's look at how I might do that um
138:54 - so if I come back here first of all
138:56 - let's just write um so down here I'm
138:58 - going to need a function called llas a
139:02 - and I'm also going to need a function
139:03 - called llas B and I'm just going to do
139:06 - something right now I'm going to just
139:07 - say they return the value one which is
139:09 - obviously like wildly incor oh boy I'm
139:11 - not here uh so I need to add these two
139:13 - functions sorry I lost I didn't get back
139:15 - here I need to add these two functions
139:17 - and I'm just for right now for
139:18 - Simplicity to make sure my code runs
139:20 - just say that they return the number one
139:22 - so that this should do something and I
139:24 - should get something um and I should get
139:27 - something so let's run this and you can
139:30 - see okay so something's working and you
139:31 - can almost even like see it oops see it
139:34 - like Flicker and do something weird and
139:35 - interesting for a second so that's good
139:37 - the other thing I want to change by the
139:39 - way and I'll deal with this later though
139:40 - let's leave that now okay
139:42 - so but now I need to actually do the
139:45 - correct llas function so what I think
139:47 - I'll do is pass into llas
139:51 - the function the current X and
139:53 - Y and then I'm going to do the entire
139:56 - calculation in that function and I need
139:58 - to do it with the grid right so what I
140:00 - need to do is say something like the sum
140:03 - for a is zero and then what I need to do
140:06 - is say sum a plus equal okay what's the
140:10 - center the center is grid XY times that
140:17 - weight1 so I need to do this like nine
140:20 - times for all nine neighbors 2 3 4 5 6 7
140:24 - 8 nine so the adjacent ones are all
140:27 - multiplied by 0 2 so adjacent to the
140:29 - left is x minus one adjacent to the
140:31 - right is+ one so these get multiplied by
140:35 - 02 then uh above and below is y + 1 and
140:40 - Yus one those get multiplied by 0.2 0.2
140:44 - now I need to do all the diagonals again
140:46 - this is like a kind of terrible manual
140:48 - way of doing it but it's and I could do
140:49 - this in a loop and a much nicer way but
140:51 - I think this is good for figuring it out
140:53 - uh minus1 minus one
140:57 - 0.05 that's up and to the
141:00 - left + one minus
141:03 - one and I just need the same value for
141:07 - each one of these uh uh okay then I need
141:11 - uh I need plus one plus one and then
141:15 - minus one minus one does that seem right
141:18 - to you did I get oh no no no no I
141:20 - already did minus one minus one + one so
141:22 - I have oh boy I've been doing this for a
141:24 - half an hour that's that's not good um
141:27 - okay look this is turning out to be a
141:28 - very long video I should have done it in
141:29 - multiple Parts but it's too late now
141:31 - okay so uh minus oneus minus minus plus
141:35 - minus plus plus minus plus that's all
141:37 - four so I think I've gotten this right
141:39 - and then I just need to return and I
141:42 - need to get those X Y values as
141:44 - arguments and then I need to return that
141:46 - sum
141:48 - a uh and then
141:52 - oh and I'm not returning that whole
141:54 - object I'm not adding that I'm adding
141:56 - the a amount for each one of these and
141:59 - you know so I could do this in a more
142:00 - clever way by also having a B1 function
142:03 - to add these objects together so now I'm
142:05 - just going to do the and I could even
142:07 - like do a function that knows whether
142:09 - it's doing lla for a or b but again I'm
142:11 - just going to do this completely the
142:13 - totally manual way and we can do another
142:16 - video I'm going to I can make this just
142:17 - a few lines of code and I'm just going
142:19 - to be sitting here here ah come on
142:21 - Sublime it's try it's trying to be way
142:23 - too smart for me I just want to I don't
142:25 - want you to give me
142:27 - suggestions sometimes I want suggestions
142:29 - sometimes I don't want suggestions and
142:31 - this is silly now that I called it this
142:32 - but I did so I'm going to go I'm going
142:35 - to go all the way through with
142:37 - it okay so now we should we've got these
142:40 - llao functions I'm doing the convolution
142:42 - for every X and Y I'm adding up all the
142:44 - neighbors and the
142:45 - weights so that should go right into
142:48 - this formula and honestly I think we
142:50 - might be done I'm going be shocked if
142:52 - this actually works we're going to have
142:53 - to debug what we missed but let's run it
142:56 - I I I know this kind of okay so sketch
142:58 - ah great I love what just happened here
143:02 - so what just happened here cannot read
143:04 - property zero of undefined so I have I I
143:07 - could kind of try to figure out what's
143:08 - going on let's look at sketch. JS line
143:11 - 65 um so down here there's an issue
143:15 - here's the issue x - one when is x - one
143:19 - going to be a completely in valid spot
143:21 - in the Grid it's a completely invalid
143:23 - spot if x is zero because there's no
143:25 - negative one so I could do some sort of
143:27 - wraparound thing or whatever but I think
143:29 - what would be easiest here would just be
143:31 - to say hey you know what for this
143:32 - calculation I'm not going to do the edge
143:35 - pixels I'm going to start at one and I'm
143:37 - going to go to width minus one and
143:38 - height minus one so I'm actually going
143:40 - to ignore the edge pixel so I don't have
143:42 - that issue so that should fix that now
143:44 - I'm going to run it and look at this
143:45 - something kind of crazy happened so I
143:48 - think I've got the algorithm going here
143:50 - I I'm a little worried to have a mistake
143:52 - but the most mostly the problem right
143:54 - now is that I haven't really seated this
143:57 - this in a way that makes sense so I
143:59 - think the traditional way these are done
144:01 - let's look here is right I'm giving the
144:03 - grid all random values is what I think
144:06 - would make sense would be to fill it
144:09 - with B right I want to fill the grid
144:12 - with B let's run
144:14 - this it's blue and it uh or it kind of
144:18 - turned red that's interesting that's not
144:20 - what I expected to happen but I'm going
144:22 - to just leave that that and then what I
144:24 - want to do is I want to give one
144:26 - spot like I'm going to say I'm going to
144:28 - override that I'm going to say like uh
144:31 - 100
144:34 - 100 a actually has a bot out of a in it
144:37 - so I fill the grid with b and no a and
144:40 - then I give one spot I I pour in a
144:42 - little a in that one
144:44 - spot why am I getting this that's so
144:46 - interesting that I'm getting this weird
144:48 - Square thing so I must have messed
144:50 - something up this is probably where this
144:52 - video is going to like pause and there's
144:54 - going to be an edit point when it gets
144:55 - posted later CU now I have to figure out
144:58 - what did I do wrong I probably got
144:59 - something wrong in this formula so I'm
145:01 - going to have to examine this formula I
145:03 - also fortunately have that working
145:04 - processing example so I can compare it
145:06 - but let's try to debug I clearly did
145:07 - something wrong so one thing I want to
145:08 - do by the way is I'm going to just look
145:10 - at the way that I colored it in that old
145:12 - processing example um so I had this
145:15 - processing example that I showed you at
145:16 - the beginning and uh um the way that I
145:19 - did the color is I took the difference
145:21 - between a and b I just made a gray scale
145:24 - and multiplied that by 255 so let's
145:26 - actually just do
145:28 - that um and I'm gonna also going to do
145:31 - VAR a equals next x y *
145:36 - a uh VAR b equals next XY dob and then
145:41 - I'm going to do the color is what did I
145:45 - say a minus B * 255 oh oh I know it a
145:49 - minus B *
145:51 - 255 uh and let's floor
145:54 - that uh and I probably also need to
145:57 - let's leave that and so let's let's make
146:00 - that the grayscale value for each of
146:03 - these spots I I I think I know some
146:04 - things that are wrong um so I'm going to
146:06 - make I'm just going to do Grays scale
146:08 - right now I was trying to be fancy by
146:09 - having different colors for a and b and
146:10 - that'll be kind of simple I also want to
146:13 - say this C equals constrain between 0
146:17 - and
146:18 - 255 um
146:20 - so I want to keep that constrained let's
146:22 - run this now and see what we get I'm
146:24 - interesting that I'm getting this like
146:25 - weird square like I must have a mistake
146:27 - in the formula I'm going to keep going
146:29 - here but one thing I also think that I
146:30 - should do is that I believe that I um is
146:33 - just to be
146:36 - safe after I do
146:41 - this I also want to
146:44 - constrain um I also want to
146:47 - constrain that new value
146:54 - uh between zero and one I'm just going
146:57 - to be like
146:58 - really over I'm going to overdo it in
147:00 - terms of the constraints here so that
147:03 - the my ranges stay reasonable let's see
147:06 - if that does anything
147:08 - different
147:12 - interesting did I uh what did I miss
147:15 - here constrain next between zero and one
147:19 - that seems reasonable right I'm getting
147:21 - these new a
147:22 - values uh I gave this an A so I'm going
147:26 - to take a look at these formulas here
147:28 - and let's double check
147:31 - them and see where I might have gotten
147:33 - it
147:37 - wrong a oh let me look at it over here A
147:41 - plus the diffusion rate times the laass
147:44 - of a hopefully I did that right minus a
147:47 - * b^ 2
147:50 - plus feed * 1 - A that seems
147:55 - good
147:57 - b equals B plus the diffusion rate of B
148:02 - plus times
148:05 - llas does have to be um XY plus a * b ^
148:10 - 2
148:12 - minus k + Fe * B so those formulas look
148:16 - right let me look in my processing
148:19 - sketch and see
148:23 - um uh let's see
148:26 - um what's going on here A plus this
148:31 - times l a A plus feed 1 minus a so these
148:34 - look right um now I bet you I messed
148:38 - something up in the lass function so I'm
148:42 - just looking I'm just scanning these
148:43 - here to see if this looks the
148:48 - same spot new spot
148:50 - um yeah grid next previous I used
148:55 - previous and grid which is a little I uh
148:58 - tricky and I did did a constrain as well
149:00 - everything looks the same right anybody
149:03 - see anything is brackets messing with
149:04 - the order of operations it's a good
149:06 - question so let's look at this let's
149:08 - look Also let's look at like my L Bloss
149:11 - function uh X grid minus
149:16 - 2.2 y +
149:18 - -2.2 and adding all those
149:21 - up then I do minus minus plusus plus
149:24 - plusus plus that looks right did I get
149:27 - it right with B also how did I and then
149:30 - let's see how I initially so these I
149:33 - expect to be right as well minus one
149:36 - minus one how did I the formulas looked
149:40 - right uh I don't I don't know if any
149:43 - parentheses or off I don't think they
149:46 - are um this is right then I get the next
149:50 - next and I'm looking at grid right not
149:53 - in next here and then I swap I'm drawing
149:57 - grid okay so let's now the other thing
149:59 - is I um let's look at how I seated it so
150:02 - in processing in the
150:04 - beginning I oh I started with all a and
150:08 - no
150:09 - B well let's try
150:13 - that and then here I give a little bit
150:17 - of B maybe that's what I just needed to
150:18 - do
150:20 - because uh that's and now I can go back
150:25 - here uh come
150:28 - back and let's see what
150:31 - happens who
150:33 - craziness that was kind of
150:36 - interesting now time scale wi now let's
150:38 - let me check these numbers let me make
150:41 - sure those numbers are
150:42 - right this is what I had here in
150:45 - processing
150:50 - those look the same
150:53 - right
150:56 - uh uh yeah okay everything looks
151:01 - identical let's be
151:07 - like so what I actually did here was I
151:09 - gave
151:11 - it object should be the same wow it
151:13 - really looks
151:15 - identical um I'm sure there's something
151:17 - I'm missing here
151:20 - the way I'm doing the
151:22 - color pixels pixels update pixels swap
151:26 - swap my swap is Right Temp is grid then
151:30 - grid is the next one and then next is
151:34 - temp that should work these are right
151:38 - this is me adding everything
151:42 - together these formulas seem right AB
151:46 - a Ab XY
151:50 - uh ab ab
151:54 - xyxy oh oh no that's right 100 100 B
151:59 - that's right should be fine with just
152:01 - one spot right because one thing I can
152:03 - do here just to like simulate it oh no
152:06 - that shouldn't matter though this
152:08 - shouldn't M oh I wonder because of the
152:09 - swap do
152:12 - that do I need to like that shouldn't
152:14 - matter though so I'm not you yeah that
152:17 - doesn't matter um let's let me just out
152:21 - of
152:23 - curiosity make these identical
152:28 - now
152:40 - um
152:42 - and
152:45 - uh that should be the same now 200 200
152:49 - just making sure this one works
152:50 - Works whoops
152:54 - oh oh is that not
152:57 - enough maybe that's the
152:59 - problem uh hold on all right that's
153:03 - interesting can I not just start with
153:05 - one spot what did I this was working
153:07 - right did I mess something up
153:10 - here put this
153:14 - back oh wait no no run this again okay
153:19 - hold on a sec everybody let's take the
153:22 - algorithm I used here to seed the system
153:25 - over here maybe just one SP oh
153:29 - whoops oh no that should be fine because
153:32 - a is
153:35 - already okay hold
153:38 - on let's do this though so n times I'm G
153:42 - to
153:43 - pick a random starting
153:46 - spot and then
153:50 - oh I realized oh my goodness
153:54 - okay I realized what the problem
153:59 - is I know what the problem is to go
154:07 - back this was a nice
154:12 - idea okay I I don't know if this is
154:14 - going to fix it I should probably go all
154:15 - the way through with this but I know
154:16 - what the problem is so
154:20 - hello I'm back I don't know where I
154:22 - that's going to get edited somehow um so
154:24 - here's the issue I just I I wanted to
154:26 - add like a little bit of B like I filled
154:28 - the whole thing with a I actually
154:29 - switched that from when I was maybe last
154:31 - in this video so I filled the whole
154:32 - thing with a and then I want to add a
154:34 - little bit of B but that's not going to
154:35 - work just like a one little droplet of
154:37 - be on one pixel not going to get enough
154:39 - reaction diffusion to make anything
154:41 - happen I actually need to give it a
154:43 - block a block of like I need to pour a
154:45 - lot more in so I need like a little area
154:47 - of so what I think I'm going to do is
154:49 - I'm I'm going to say uh for I'm going to
154:51 - use I here just to use a different like
154:53 - I equal 100 I is less than 10 I ++ no I
154:56 - is less than
154:58 - 110 i++ now how you seed the system is
155:02 - like super interesting and I'm doing
155:04 - this not in a very interesting way but
155:05 - I'm going to use
155:06 - J uh
155:09 - j++ and what I'm going to do is I'm
155:12 - going to take a whole
155:16 - area and give it some B like a little 10
155:19 - by1 pixel area so every pixel from
155:22 - between 100 to 110 is going to get some
155:24 - B right every pixel is going to start
155:26 - with a lot of a and no B and then this
155:28 - little 10 by10 area is going to start
155:30 - with a and what I'm actually going to do
155:32 - is just for a second comment this out so
155:35 - let's just see what this looks like now
155:37 - why am I I'm getting this crazy
155:39 - flickering you can't see that actually
155:42 - interestingly enough I don't think the
155:43 - flickering is showing up because I've
155:45 - done something wrong with my
155:47 - rendering but you can see though that
155:50 - whoa oh now you're seeing interest I
155:52 - don't know what you're actually seeing
155:53 - on the stream um oh boy this is a really
155:57 - this was a much harder one than I
155:59 - imagined but I'm going to put this back
156:00 - in I got to figure out what the
156:02 - flickering is there why the flickering
156:03 - is
156:04 - happening okay so you can see this is
156:07 - now finally working um I'm getting a
156:10 - weird flickering around the edges oh oh
156:13 - I know what the problem is I know what
156:14 - the problem
156:17 - is because I'm not updating the edges
156:21 - the edges need to make sure they're
156:22 - seated with the original amount of
156:25 - stuff there we go finally we're good so
156:28 - it took me a little while there but the
156:29 - issue was that I needed to place an area
156:33 - of of pixels um in order to to to seat
156:36 - it with some chemical B so uh this was
156:39 - this was much this would have been good
156:40 - this would have benefited from this will
156:42 - benefit from a second run like I could
156:43 - just do this whole thing again and
156:45 - probably get through it a lot faster
156:46 - with less hiccups but hopefully this
156:49 - helped you can see now I now have the
156:52 - reaction diffusion simulation you can
156:53 - see this is one little area of pixels um
156:56 - and you know what happens if you give it
156:58 - like like a circular area of pixels or
157:00 - start stuff with like random values what
157:03 - kind of patterns might you get and you
157:04 - can see the reaction diffusion algorithm
157:06 - is kind of blossoming into this nice
157:08 - little flower we can let it run for a
157:09 - little bit I'm curious about the frame
157:11 - rate I I'm it's JavaScript is handling
157:13 - this pretty well this is only 200x 200
157:16 - pixels um so it isn't um it is isn't a
157:20 - tremendous amount of pixels for it to
157:22 - work with but so you might run into some
157:24 - serious performance issues if you do
157:26 - this in the browser it's going to run a
157:27 - lot faster in processing of course I'm
157:30 - sure there's like fancy Shader web gel
157:32 - ways of doing this super super fast but
157:34 - um I think this kind of wraps up this
157:36 - tutorial so to recap just now that we've
157:38 - kind of like just want to use this last
157:40 - few minutes to kind of recap what I've
157:42 - got is uh here we started out with uh in
157:48 - the code which to walk through all the
157:50 - pieces of the code now there is the grid
157:52 - which stores the amount of A and B
157:54 - chemicals across every pixel there are
157:57 - all these constants which are associated
157:59 - with the gray Scott inter implementation
158:01 - so there's a an amount of diffusion for
158:03 - a an amount of diffusion for B there's a
158:05 - feed rate and a kill rate so you can
158:06 - look up different values for those like
158:08 - known values that produce different
158:09 - patterns you can also just play with
158:11 - those yourself then I have to create
158:13 - these two dimensional arrays I need a
158:16 - current and a next because I got to
158:18 - calculate the Next Generation and then
158:19 - use the current as the Next Generation
158:21 - then use it as the next I've got this
158:22 - cycling going on and I'm starting
158:24 - filling it each spot with all chemical a
158:27 - and no B then I start a little area of
158:31 - pixels a 10 x10 area of pixels to put
158:33 - some chemical B in and this is another
158:35 - place where you wanting to play with
158:37 - this code you should try something
158:38 - different like what if you fill in
158:40 - around the Contours of a silhouette and
158:42 - you start getting this like silhouetted
158:44 - person reaction diffusion pattern then
158:47 - in draw I do a bunch of things number
158:49 - number one is I just actually Implement
158:51 - that reaction diffusion formula I need
158:53 - to calculate the next amount of A and B
158:56 - based on the current amount of a the
158:57 - diffusion rate the feed the kill rate
158:59 - all of that stuff as well as this sum of
159:02 - all of the neighbors so the sum of all
159:04 - the neighbors happens in these llas
159:06 - functions and that is lower down in the
159:08 - code again I would suggest and I'd be
159:11 - happy to do this and post this at some
159:12 - point if someone wants to remind me
159:14 - modified version I could condense this
159:16 - into one function and I could also make
159:17 - this happen in a loop but I think this
159:19 - really shows exactly what's happening
159:21 - and these weights again are defined by
159:23 - The Sims uh page you could use you could
159:25 - weight things or you could have a 5x5
159:27 - Matrix you could do different things
159:28 - there so that's calculating all those
159:30 - next values and then here the only thing
159:33 - that's happening here is I'm Now setting
159:35 - every single Pixel in the window a color
159:38 - based on the amount of a and the amount
159:39 - of B and I'm just using black and white
159:41 - so it's up to you I think I could go
159:43 - back you could say well the amount of a
159:44 - could be the amount of blue the amount
159:46 - of B could be amount of the green you
159:47 - could you could create Rainbow cycling
159:49 - color somebody make a rainbow reaction
159:51 - diffusion thing um there's a lot of
159:53 - possibilities there for how you can play
159:54 - with this but this is all of the code I
159:56 - think this is probably a 40 to 45 minute
159:58 - video I'm assuming at this point um and
160:01 - so uh please play with this uh send me
160:04 - your feedback send me your comments and
160:06 - um let me know how it goes thanks for
160:10 - watching okay live stream Watchers I I
160:14 - I'm guessing I've got like 50 people
160:15 - watching now let's
160:17 - see uh let's see I oh 95 people are
160:20 - still I guess people um okay so the I
160:23 - can't believe that I've done this live
160:24 - stream now for 2 hours and 40 minutes I
160:26 - did take a couple breaks um I think this
160:28 - really uh um draws to a close here I'm
160:31 - quite pleased with this result I think
160:33 - this worked out well you can see it's
160:34 - sort of asymmetrical because my pixels
160:36 - weren't picked actually in the center of
160:37 - this so you you might sort of see what
160:39 - happens you get this I I completely I'm
160:41 - completely brain dead right now I need
160:42 - to go drop by ITP and eat some lunch and
160:45 - check my email on my phone make sure
160:46 - there's no important messages um
160:50 - so oh yeah so people are asking I might
160:52 - as well just try it right now just for
160:55 - fun real quick um let's just see if I
160:58 - right here go back and say uh a * 255
161:02 - and B
161:04 - um B *
161:06 - 255 and I'm GNA add floor so I can
161:09 - quickly just to see what happens if I
161:10 - add the colors
161:13 - in uh and I think that should do it so
161:16 - you can see I've got what should
161:18 - hopefully be a nice combination of Blues
161:21 - and reds and pinks and purples as so
161:23 - it's very slow going and I probably
161:25 - could do something to calculate it more
161:28 - quickly behind the scenes and somebody
161:30 - suggested using web workers there's all
161:31 - sorts of possibilities here but you can
161:33 - kind of enjoy this and play with colors
161:35 - in different ways okay I'm GNA um stick
161:37 - around here for a minute or two to see
161:38 - if there's any questions I'm I'm going
161:41 - to return this week on Thursday our
161:43 - Friday I'm going to try to set up a
161:45 - patreon this week so um please help me
161:47 - uh spread the word about that if you're
161:49 - enjoying this stuff and you feel so
161:51 - inclined um oh this will definitely get
161:54 - archived for YouTube I think I'll
161:55 - probably cut out about 5 to 10 minutes
161:57 - of the debugging uh and when I say I
161:59 - have I've one of the reasons why I want
162:01 - to start the patreon is I've hired a a
162:03 - wonderful person um who lives in Canada
162:06 - who's been helping me maintain the
162:07 - descriptions and the tags and edit some
162:09 - videos so if you have suggestions for
162:11 - how things could be organized better for
162:13 - how things could be edited for how
162:14 - things could be tagged to improve search
162:17 - uh please let me know um and so this
162:19 - this whole stream will be Arch as soon
162:21 - as I hit stop this whole thing will be
162:22 - archived all 2 hours and 40 minutes will
162:24 - be archived on YouTube but I think I
162:27 - don't know I might take like the jumping
162:29 - thing as like its own Standalone video
162:31 - not so sure about that some of the
162:32 - question answer stuff might get archive
162:33 - too um um so I'm going to kind of scroll
162:37 - back uh I'm just going to see if anybody
162:39 - has any questions uh make it faster
162:42 - that's something to do why you used VAR
162:44 - over let uh VAR is just sort of like um
162:48 - this JavaScript style that I'm using
162:49 - it's what I'm used to I didn't know that
162:51 - you could use let in JavaScript maybe
162:52 - you can um JavaScript is so
162:56 - flexible um that was that was one
162:59 - question I'm curious I'm not while I'm
163:00 - here I'm just going to look at twitch
163:01 - for a second seven people are watching
163:05 - um uh oh oh let me mention a couple
163:08 - things while I'm here because I I want
163:09 - some uh feedback about this oh I think
163:12 - I'm off Facebook Facebook wow Facebook
163:15 - couldn't maintain it uh oh it says it's
163:18 - also said it's end
163:19 - that's interesting I wonder if Facebook
163:20 - was like you can't stream for 2 hours
163:22 - and 45 minutes you crazy
163:24 - person um so one thing I want to talk
163:28 - about is that um I so I um I have two
163:32 - kids and they like to they both like to
163:33 - play Minecraft or the the the four
163:35 - almost 5-year-old is a little too young
163:36 - for it my seven-year-old is is really
163:38 - kind of obsessed with it and I was I've
163:40 - been researching and trying Minecraft
163:42 - modding for a while and it I kind of was
163:44 - like excited about that I was going to
163:45 - make a processing add-on for it but I
163:47 - Goan l over the weekend suggested
163:50 - something called computercraft to me
163:52 - which is a Minecraft mod which allows
163:54 - you to um this is not the page I'm
163:56 - looking for I was kind of looking for
163:57 - the wiki um here this is a nice page it
164:01 - allows you to create these uh blocks in
164:04 - Minecraft if you're not familiar with
164:05 - Minecraft you just shut this off right
164:06 - now or um which allows you to write Lua
164:09 - code into it and so I was thinking of
164:11 - doing some interesting tutorials of try
164:13 - and it let you create these like turtle
164:15 - blocks which allow you to like build
164:17 - structures in Minecraft and I was
164:18 - thinking taking nature of code
164:20 - algorithms and programming these Turtle
164:22 - blocks to do like L systems or different
164:24 - like fractal or maze patterns in
164:26 - Minecraft and honestly one I was
164:28 - thinking of doing this because it kind
164:29 - of interests me the other reason I was
164:32 - thinking of doing this honestly was
164:33 - because you know you look at YouTube and
164:35 - you see some of these uh Minecraft
164:37 - videos have you know millions of views
164:38 - and millions of subscribers so there's
164:40 - an interest level for that could I
164:41 - combine programming education Minecraft
164:45 - you know I realized Minecraft is
164:46 - commercial software I try to use like
164:47 - open platforms but um so I'm thinking of
164:49 - doing that my concern is is that too
164:53 - much of a distraction from this kind of
164:54 - core audience that I have of people
164:56 - interested in JavaScript and processing
164:57 - and creative coding so I uh I'm curious
165:00 - for your feedback um I don't know
165:03 - whether that should be a separate
165:04 - Channel or the same channel or I
165:05 - shouldn't do that or I should do that
165:06 - but if you have suggestions or thoughts
165:08 - about that I don't have a good way of
165:10 - Twitter would be a way to communicate
165:12 - with me or write in the YouTube comments
165:13 - I guess on this particular uh on the
165:15 - archive of this video um but uh am I
165:19 - still streaming on YouTube by the way
165:21 - because Facebook said it ended yeah I
165:22 - see myself there so uh I might look in
165:25 - the chat to see for a second but um
165:27 - ultimately what I'm thinking of doing
165:29 - with this patreon is creating a a
165:32 - private slack for uh people who
165:35 - subscribe to the patreon so and that
165:37 - will be a place for discussion and
165:38 - question answering and I'll still answer
165:39 - questions on the YouTube comments and
165:41 - the Kaden forum and the processing Forum
165:44 - um and I and I don't ever have an
165:45 - intention of making videos that aren't
165:47 - always open and available but I do um
165:49 - you know I do think I need to look into
165:51 - some uh uh Revenue different Revenue
165:54 - economic experiments for this stuff as
165:56 - I'd like to buy some new equipment and
165:57 - pay people and pay myself U Beyond just
166:00 - you know this is anyway so that's kind
166:02 - of a discussion I reference it almost
166:04 - every time I do a live stream and it
166:06 - just honestly like it's to me I'm like
166:08 - oh I could spend the day setting up the
166:09 - patreon or I could just do another live
166:10 - stream and I usually just choose to do
166:12 - the live stream but we'll see what
166:13 - happens next time um so uh ah so people
166:17 - are talking about uh uh they'd like to
166:19 - see genetic algorithm stuff actually one
166:21 - thing I'd really like to do is see if
166:23 - Caden would let me license the videos
166:26 - and include them in my YouTube stream
166:28 - because I just I did all these genetic
166:29 - algorithm videos with the Caden course
166:31 - you could go to their site and watch
166:32 - them and open I can think of a million I
166:33 - can think of several reasons why they
166:35 - wouldn't want me to do that but um I
166:37 - sort of I feel like am I really going to
166:38 - redo all these genetic algorithms
166:40 - tutorials when I did it for the Caden
166:41 - course so I'll think about that you know
166:44 - um but I do those haven't come out yet
166:46 - so when those come out they'll be
166:47 - available there um
166:49 - I'd be very interested to see if anyone
166:50 - tries this s of reaction diffusion stuff
166:52 - in 3D it would all kind of work the same
166:54 - way um can you point me in the right
166:57 - direction to turn these sketches into
166:58 - interactive screen savers um so if you
167:01 - want to use um a a pro you can use
167:04 - processing you can make a
167:06 - application it really depends a
167:08 - processing you can make a Java
167:10 - application out of it if you can turn a
167:11 - Java application into a screen saver
167:13 - then you're done uh with JavaScript you
167:15 - need something that will wrap a web page
167:16 - into a screen saver and there's stuff
167:18 - like that for window windows and for Mac
167:20 - um OS
167:23 - um uh the 3D would be the same idea with
167:25 - 26 neighboring cells yes that's right uh
167:29 - what you're doing is quite interesting
167:31 - I'm jumping into python is there a
167:32 - similar starting point compared to your
167:34 - book um actually um I don't know this
167:37 - isn't necessarily the the best python
167:41 - starting point as like learning the
167:42 - language Python and what python is
167:44 - generally used for and and but if you're
167:46 - interested in kind of creative coding
167:48 - and processing python then um Allison
167:50 - parish is working on a version of Casey
167:52 - Reese and Ben Fri getting started uh
167:54 - with processing do I I believe I can't
167:56 - remember if it's out yet or not so I'm
167:58 - going to Google it and find it on Amazon
168:02 - um and um there it is does this look out
168:06 - pre-order so you have to pre-order this
168:08 - but this would be a starting point by
168:10 - the way I'm just like now I'm just uh if
168:12 - you're ever interested in ordering stuff
168:13 - on Amazon and you want to throw a few
168:15 - dollars my way if you just go here to
168:17 - like natureof code.com and click on
168:19 - Amazon even if you don't buy nature of
168:21 - code you you move around and buy other
168:22 - stuff it's going to do an associate uh
168:24 - fee to me better yet though I just want
168:26 - to give a plug to Amazon smile
168:29 - processing foundation so you can
168:30 - actually have all of your purchases uh
168:33 - support processing with amazon. smile so
168:36 - Amazon donates processing is a
168:37 - registered charity a processing
168:39 - Foundation okay
168:42 - um uh can you make a tutorial about P5
168:45 - Jess and touch devices let me make sure
168:47 - that's on my list
168:49 - because I definitely want to do p5js and
168:51 - mobile yes it's on my
168:54 - list uh video I did by the way I don't
168:56 - know whether I completed it but I'm
168:58 - going to check that oh I'm not logged in
168:59 - so I'll check that later but mobile is
169:01 - on my list sound is on my list that sort
169:03 - of thing um okay I think uh two hours
169:06 - and 48 minutes is pretty good for a live
169:09 - stream I'm going to go now um it's it's
169:12 - um uh I've been taking piano lessons
169:15 - with my son we take it together and we
169:17 - um at the end of every piano lison we
169:19 - sing a song going to sing the song I
169:21 - can't believe I'm G to do this I'm going
169:23 - to go now
169:24 - byebye I'm going to go now byebye see
169:28 - you later see you later see you on
169:31 - Thursday or Friday or maybe next week so
169:33 - stay tuned if you want to find out when
169:35 - my next live stream is can't believe I
169:38 - just did that um you can I'll obviously
169:40 - update on Twitter but uh on the top
169:42 - right here um it's because I'm not
169:45 - streaming to the Facebook anymore so uh
169:47 - you can put in your email here and I
169:48 - send out updates and I'll send out
169:49 - updates about the patreon and that type
169:51 - of thing I mean unsubscribe if you don't
169:52 - want to get emails from me but that's a
169:54 - place on shiffman Donnet um Android mode
169:57 - n Android mode I'm afraid of but I I
169:59 - would like to I could try that at some
170:00 - point okay everybody so I'm gonna do two
170:02 - things one is I'm gonna click this
170:04 - record button so I'm now I've stopped
170:06 - recording this so that's my like
170:08 - archived backup of this whole thing and
170:10 - I can't believe I had no technical
170:11 - difficulties today that's pretty good
170:13 - and now I'm going to click the live
170:15 - stream end button which they will end
170:17 - now uh it will take probably YouTube an
170:19 - hour or two to process it then this full
170:21 - archive will be there and then sometime
170:23 - by tomorrow or the next day the
170:25 - description will include time codes to
170:27 - where various things in the video are as
170:29 - well as definitely the diffusion thing
170:31 - as a separate Standalone video and
170:33 - possibly um the platform jumping thing
170:37 - too okay thanks everybody thanks for
170:39 - watching I really appreciate uh how many
170:41 - people tuned in today that was kind of
170:42 - amazing

Cleaned transcript:

good morning hello good afternoon good evening good middle of the night I don't know where you are I don't know where I actually I do know where I am my glasses are very dirty I am now uh uh I attempting something that I've never attempted before and I will say a little bit in a minute about maybe who I am and what I'm doing here but I'm currently I turned on a live stream to three different outputs YouTube twitch and Facebook Facebook now has live streaming I'm not so sure this is such a good idea but I don't know what's currently working so I'm going to uh take a look at my laptop over here and I'm going to check the most important one is really the YouTube one which ah does seem to be working oops and I'm um uh which is good because that's the one that was giving me the most trouble before so people on YouTube people of YouTube people of Earth YouTube or alien YouTube if you're watching this in the distant future or the not so distant future in the alien YouTube thing in the archive robot let takeover time thing anyway uh let me know how the sound quality is uh is the picture quality okay I also have this whiteboard is this over here I need to I didn't actually Focus the camera I'm out of sorts I was in another foreign country on the other side of the world for a while but I'm back and I'm ready here I've got six straight weeks of doing this uh I see people on YouTube are saying things seem to be working I'm not g to I'm gonna open up Twitch just so I have it here too uh twitch uh and then I'm going to Facebook am I streaming to Facebook I don't know how to I don't know how to tell uh maybe if I go to my profile page I can see if I am oh look I am look at that uh Facebook streaming is a great idea okay there I am I'm on I'm I'm on Mom Dad I'm on Facebook is that a thing um so okay so let me give a quick introduction for anybody who's watching uh about what's going to happen here it's very warm in here today I'm going to have to I have a tshirt on underneath I might have to remove the outer layer I'm starting to feel a little the clamped um okay so my name is Dan uh schiffman I am a person who lives in New York City uh I uh work on a lot of different things uh namely a couple things I work on are something called processing and something called p5js those are programming environments I uh sometimes be on the internet to uh do lessons and tutorials and things about programming so that's where I am right now and I I haven't actually I'm doing this weekly I haven't done this in a couple weeks cuz I was away um in China lovely country pollution was not so great but otherwise I had an amazing time uh I would love to say more about that but I think I should move on um uh YouTube is not available in China I met with some folks who are suggesting maybe I upload some of my content to yuku I might do some subtitles that's another story for another time I'm here today uh trying to get back my head back into things uh and figure out what to do today so the first the thing I'm going to start with uh is that I'm currently running an online course with a company called Caden uh and um I'm going to look at the Forum post there have been some questions there with some interesting topics and I will answer those questions and do a few programming examples mostly about uh physics simulation and forces uh and then I'm going to go to my list of topics and try to pick something else uh to kind of do as a tutorial today as well well and in the future I will have these much more planned but I literally had like 20 minutes to get this set up and it's working uh and there it is so I I've like I've desperately is this is like social media addiction which I like desperately want to like look and see what's going on but I so those of you who are watching online I don't know if there is a Facebook Chat where you can ask questions or but uh the chat that I typically look at is YouTube so somebody you can you can find my YouTube channel I'm sure uh okay uh so I'm going to the YouTube channel I'm going to check the comments uh and leave Facebook alone it is evil agreed look I'm just here trying to reach as many people as possible and you know we'll see what happens uh okay so everything is working everybody's saying things are working that's wonderful I am not on the live dashboard I need to switch to a different page give me a second oh I have that over here closing this opening this do you like my n oh 42 wow this is like I've never had so many people watching at once this is very exciting and this is my least prepared day for this so this is terrible okay so the first thing I'm going to do is um uh uh okay so one thing I'll mention is so this is you're watching the current live stream I like how Google thinks I'm in Hong Kong it's gone now it knows I'm in New York uh so this live stream is me just talking and operating some computers but what I will do oh and I have to hit record uh I'm GNA hit record so now I am recording this live stream disc because what will happen later is if there are if it so happens that there are some nuggets of wisdom or some uh short 10minute spots that are useful tutorials I will edit those separately as videos and upload to Youtube um a couple just administrative things I want to talk about so I've been doing some traveling my traveling is done until July 4th so I'm going to be doing this every week for six weeks straight I'm hoping to do two sessions per week 100% I'm going to well 100% I'm definitely going to do one but I would like to do two sessions per week I have a slight problem which is that on June 8th I've been called for jury duty which arguably is actually quite a convenient time for me to do it because I have kind of nothing else going on semester is over summer this is my thing now um but so uh June 8th which is a Wednesday I I have jury duty so I'll be out for a few days doing that or longer depending on what what happens with that the other thing I'll mention is that I am going to start a patreon uh so if you're interested in that uh there'll be more information about that in some various form now if you want to get email announcements I'll just mention really briefly this is the last sort of admin thing I'll do if you go to uh shiffman domnet which is my uh website and up in the corner here there is a place where you can put in your email hit get updates usually what I typically right I'm trying to establish a regular schedule I've been saying that for like three months and I have not managed to do so but um I have been uh at some point I will but what I've been doing is it's essentially like the night before or two days before sending an email saying this Tuesday 1100 a.m. eastern standard time will be the live stream which is today Tuesday at 1100 a.m. so you can sign up to get those otherwise Twitter yada yada yada y 63 people are watching this is like we're approaching a record one of these days I'm going to get to 100 uh plus 38 and I don't I don't know if I can count the Facebook yet and uh uh it should always be referred to as the Facebook maybe that makes it less evil I'm not sure this it's all evil right I mean or it's not I mean what's what's evil what's not evil it's all evil hopefully I'm not evil uh the website again is shiffman Donnet uh okay so I'm just poking around here to see uh what's going on I see that I'm on Twitch I'm on YouTube Facebook has 47 viewers this is insane but I I guess Facebook has like an audience there uh all right uh okay I'm awkwardly ah I feel like terrified now somebody somebody magically tell me it's going to be okay uh uh um you are a lens but a person behind the lens okay so let me start by going to I'm going to do some Quest Q&A so I'm gonna go I'm running this thing now I'm running this uh course with Caden you know me personally just to give you a quick point of view I much prefer now over the past number of years of doing this kind of stuff I prefer to do selfpublishing I prefer to just sort of have my own YouTube channel make videos kind of independently try to have stuff be open and available for free experiment with different Revenue models whether crowdsourcing whether advertising or none whether just sort of being paid by a university and sort will have them let me do this but I did do an exper and I I had sort of a negative experience with the learning processing book which I could talk about on a uh which was done with a publishing company but I did decide to do a course with this company um as an experiment um there's some great people who worked for this company uh it was interesting to do sort of a collaboration I kind of do these videos on my own but there were various people to collaborate with to help with sort of scripting and editing and all that sort of stuff so anyway U that's that's um what's happening there so this course is running you can see all the videos for free and you can pay some amount of money to I don't know submit assignments and that sort of thing so what I would like to do is log in uh uh by the way I love that there's an email that pops up in my autofill that says daniel. shman plus unicorn like when did I I I was like every once in a while I need like an extra email address and at one point I must have typed in plus unicorn that's pretty great uh okay but my email for Caden is definitely this and I have no idea what my password is I totally spelled that wrong let's see if that works oh it's totally the wrong password okay I'm gonna look it up over here I have a separate computer I use uh I'm not GNA plug some password organization tool I'm going to look it up here kadenz uh and my password is uh oh my God it is an impossible to remember password good job being with my security okay this is going to be insane I'm going to read you some of the letters capital y0 z capital V uh n parentheses capital r capital Y lowercase r n parentheses capital m capital I and then three more things great now my password with knowing all of that log in oh come on oh invalid this is okay deck failure o pause pause time do I have that superpower yet no I don't it's a live stream so I can't pause time I must I either typed it in wrong or okay I'm just gonna here's what I'm gonna do right now I'm going to just look at it over on this computer because I just want to look at the questions uh and you know what may maybe it's better this way anyway um because I don't maybe people don't want their uh names if they did a forum post showing up on this live stream so now I'm going to do login uh come on you can do it this is must be riveting for those of you watching maybe I could get a Chewbacca mask and wear it and that would help um uh I'm typ in my email and typing in my password okay I must oh yeah it worked okay so I I was not able to transfer it correctly so I'm logged in now I'm going to go to the forums you can't see this but and I will read to you the questions I'm also going to check the chat um uh okay I am uh I am now in the core uh now I'm in the forums and I'm going to start looking at some questions a lot of questions there so hello now I need to check the YouTube chat because you can also if you're on YouTube do live questions if you're on the Facebook remember it is pronounced the Facebook one word I think right um uh uh um I I I don't know how to I don't know how to see I don't understand this Facebook thing maybe I should use Snapchat I should like Snapchat this is that how you do it I think that's how you do it I read an article that said Snapchat for old people how to understand it and it it sort of made sense to me um okay uh where am I YouTube I'm looking for YouTube I'm also on Twitch um okay oh a yes I'm definitely at some point gonna get a 360 camera in here because why not I mean come on okay I don't see any questions so far on YouTube I do see that there are 73 people watching which is kind of shocking to me well I I have a very I do very I like I've done several things in the past like completely have computers freeze and things which tends to send people away so I'm going to go to the forums now and I'm going to uh wow there's a lot of questions um and I'm actually going to start with a question that comes from uh Alex um and the question is um I feel like I want to speak directly to you this is very bad what I'm about to do here this way I could look at you while I'm reading I'm attempting to create a moderately functional Sid R ER using different forces and whatnot but the acceleration of my object seems immediate and abrupt going from zero uh zero to acceleration to an immediate constant acceleration yada yada yada etc etc I'm looking for advice how to simulate gravity so that jumping can be implemented such as when a user presses a key to jump a force is exerted displaying that jump okay I think I get this question this is a great programming problem I think we could spend some time working it out for those of you who might be interested and if both of you are not interested you can just turn this off I recommend probably that you turn it off um I have some uh tea here I will take a sip of that for a second I oh I I I'm not supposed to talk about drinking the tea because the last time I did that somebody on YouTube was very angry at me and wrote lots of comments about okay so let's talk about what I think we're going to program here to answer this first question so let's imagine uh this is your canvas and um you have this sort of like scene where you have this uh stick figure and the stick figure is is moving across like a platform this is some standard kind of game I think right somebody can post in the chat plat not a platform game it's like a sidescroller maybe that's what it's called and so this uh person is moving this way and maybe there are like different obstacles and what you want is for this person this character to be able to jump over those obstacles not too dissimilar from like Flappy Bird also right we Flappy Bird there's like I just wanted to see if I could draw a bird let's see my alien bird oh look with some weird crazy dragon wings or something I don't know I I I lost I got lost in my own fantasy imagination there for a second sorry so um so you can imagine this bird flying this way and you press a key and it pushes a force pushing up so one of the things actually in most of my examples and even if you go back and watch all my nature of code videos that are on YouTube or the videos that are for this Caden course generally you'll see that I have these forces being applied continuously like gravity is always there or an object is always seeking a Target so I think this is an interesting thing to to discuss what about a kind of instantaneous Force for example I'm just standing here and suddenly this great force just instantaneously pushes me up from the bottom and I jump so um how would you simulate that and of course like a key press or a mouse click could do something like that so the other thing that I think is interesting about this problem is that um you know what what's moving right this in the in the world right if I move this way I move this way right I'm right here's this pen and I'm moving oh no I can't do it I'm moving towards the pen but what's not to say that the uh I can't do this optical illusion the pen moving am I moving or is the pen moving you can see because the back the point is that was a terrible demonstration the point is what hap what if I want the background to move I want it to appear that this person is moving but they're actually in the canvas staying in the same place so that's kind of an interesting question as well so let's uh I I guess um let's go see if we can let me come back here and I I see green bars which means audio is still working um checking the chat um uh okay there's some weird things going on in the chat which I will ignore um so let's see let's figure out where we're going to program this so um one thing I should do I think is let's not start from scratch so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to uh GitHub um and uh I have a lot of code in a lot of places I don't know what that means that sounds a little weird uh and I want to go to uh repositories and I'm going to look at this one for right now so um I have a lot of different nature of code repositories for various simulation and physics examples this has some code that goes specifically with that particular online course so I'm just going to start from there uh and I'm going to uh just download it as a zip um if you're wondering about git and GitHub for only 0 and0 you could watch my GitHub tutorials is it popping up here no because it doesn't do that but I do have some get GitHub tutorials they are free you have to watch some ads I might turn off the ads I don't know what to do about the ads okay so I think I downloaded that and uh what I'm going to do is show in finder I'm going to open up this folder and uh session one session two um let's put this folder on the desktop just for right now uh over here and let's find an example to start with uh session two three examples which to begin with let's do the particles array one uh and I'm going to but what we're doing is actually quite different than these examples so I'm going to use this P5 editor even though I haven't actually been using it recently in these video tutorials I've been using adom or Sublime uh okay but let's just let's look at what this example is doing click it says here click to add particles so okay so you can see what this this is how my examples typically look right my examples typically look like okay there's a bunch of things in the screen and there are various forces one force is gravity another force is wind so I think when I click the mouse you can see that there's this wind Force suddenly being applied so in that sense a force is being applied one force is being applied continuously the Gravity Force another force is being applied only when the mouse is held down but neither of those are just like a single onetime Force but let's at least look at where in the code that's happening and then I'm going to completely restructure this example to um do this platform thing okay so uh here uh here in the sketch we can see this happening here so um there there are these particle objects and the particle objects are in a particle's array and an apply Force function is being called on each of those apply Force gravity is always being called apply force wind is only being called if the mouse is pressed basic structure for an example and uh now if I go to the particle object here is the key thing that I want to show you this is the apply Force function so I you know I I don't know who's watching this or where you're from or why you're here or if you've already left or what but just to mention briefly these examples are built on Newton's second law of motion which is stated as Force equals mass time ACC acceleration the definition of a force is a vector a thing that causes an object with mass to accelerate so if I push something with a force that object it has a mass it's going to accelerate so that's written this way Force equals mass time acceleration it can also be written as acceleration equals force divided by mass so if I go back over here to the code you'll see that's exactly what's Happening Here the apply Force function receives a force variable it divides it by mass and it adds it to the object's acceleration now there's a lot more to say about that and so if you want to kind of go back and what's a vector and how did it get all the way to this point then you could go and watch either my uh it's just like a walking advertisement for myself which is kind of weird but uh you can watch the nature of code videos that I have on YouTube or uh you better yet you might just go and watch the videos that are with on the Caden website for this particular course okay um uh oh did somebody said yeah I can't hear any some something okay stop time out I need to know if people can hear audio before I keep going so I'm going to clap I'm gonna do the Hand Jive can you hear that I hear sound I hear sound I hear sound yes okay people are saying they hear sound I I can't I can't look at the Facebook I'm afraid of it so the Facebook is happening if you want if you're on watching on Facebook and you want to interact with me you're going to have to go to the YouTube chat I can only look at one chat okay great everything's working fine um okay so where are we okay so now I need to completely restructure this example because if you're still with me what I'm trying to build is this let's make a game why not let's make a game where you're a little person or a big person or or an alien or whatever it is and you're running and obstacles are there and you have to jump over them I think we could do that I I got time I don't have anywhere to go I mean I have to eat lunch at some point I mean I don't have to I could skip lunch salad would be nice okay um so here we go so I've got a I don't know if it was so great to start with this particular example because it's got a lot of extra stuff in it but I'm going to do uh I'm going to do save as and I'm gonna um just put this on the desktop right now and I'm going to call this the running game is that a thing running game I don't know what that is I hope that's not something like weird that I just called it okay um so what I want to do here is now have a um uh person and I'm going to say uh I'm going to just say the person uh forget about this mouse press thing ah ah oh how's this font size I feel like this font size needs to be a little bit bigger uh that looks good I think you can read that let me know if the font size is okay uh wow I've never this is definitely a record that there are 80 people watching this on YouTube right now which is kind of a little terrifying okay the person is a new particle and oh I have this like I have so many things that I want to do in these videos I let's see how much time we have today it's 1130 I got at least till 1 o'clock 1 pm um then I will be attending there is an exhibition at ITP of um experimental storytelling things anybody wants to stop by and say hi uh okay it's a little hot in here um okay so now what I want to do is I'm just going to say let's um I'm going to simplify some things this particle object is going to be my person and I am going to take out this idea of mass because that will make things a little bit simpler and I am going to and I will review all the pieces of this code once uh I'm going to say uh once things are kind of going I'm going to say person. update person do is it show or display let's see what's the name of that function display person. display and um let's just see and uh the particle and let's just rename this the person uh and uh and I'm gonna say new whoops I'm gonna say then new person uh okay and let's see so what do I have now if I run this good I don't see any errors uh let's oh no uh and then I'm going to go here I'm going to just get rid of this click to add particles from the HTML file and run this okay uh that's strange didn't I delete that did I not save it there we go okay there we go okay so now I've got my empty canvas now okay so what I want this person let's just make the person a rectangle you will do this someday on your own and make this more interesting and actually I'm going to uh just simplify things and get rid of these arguments and say the person is going to be at pixel uh 50 and the location will be at Y is um uh height so I'm gonna draw this person this is I'm everything is always so tricky I'm gonna draw this person I want to draw this person just as a rectangle kind of sitting on the bottom of the screen uh so let's see so the location is am I back here yet no the location is the bottom of the screen so now I want to in the display function I want to make this a rectangle uh so a rectangle at this do X and Y is the height but let's say a height let's say the the person is 50 pixels tall so this doy minus 50 like 20 pixels wide and 50 pixels high and those should be variables but let's just see if at the very least we have I don't see the person yet so what's what's missing um let's uh let's let's get rid of um update for a second I still don't see the person uh let's see let's uh oh thisp is the the name of the variable it's a vector object not individual x's and y's of course there we go so now we're getting somewhere yay we have a little uh Square there at the bottom and I want that person to move so let's put um uh let's put sorry let's put uh update back in okay so I I I'm at a point now where I can take a moment to breathe and kind of I just had to restructure that example I it probably would have honestly been easier me just programm this from scratch but that's the example we had so the person has is an object with an update and a display function let's look at what it means to be this person the person has a position which is where that person is on the screen a velocity meaning its current change in position and acceleration which is the thing that's going to be How does its velocity change which is uh uh uh Changed by a force so let just to get a sort of experiment going here what if I were to say uh in the what the person's velocity instead of being Z 0 was is 1 comma 0 so now if I were to run this again we can see there's the person moving so we can see that velocity this velocity Vector controls um the person's movement now interestingly enough let's place an obstacle in the scene I want to kind of tackle this weird uh view Port question problem first before I get any too far into this so let's let's place an obstacle on the scene and I'm going to just say obstacle equals uh I'm going to say I'm going to make a variable called obstacle and I'm going to say obstacle equals create Vector um uh and you know what I'm just going to have the yeah um there's so many different ways I could do this um I'm gonna say um you know what I'm going to do I'm uh we're gonna I think we're going to want an obstacle object so for right now I'm going to do something totally silly which is just hard code something in so I'm going to make this nice uh some sort of purplish pinkish color and I'm going to say rectangle where this window is 640 pixels wide so let's stick it at 400 pixels uh make it uh uh 50 pixels wide and uh uh 50 pixels High uh so I'm doing the same sort of thing here um like this uh oh No 3 ah so this would be height minus 50 okay so I'm just trying to draw a another rectangle that sits at the Bott bottom and so what I want is the idea here for this example is as this thing is moving I want to press the space bar and have it jump over that obstacle this is what we're going for you guys still with me oh 94 people my my head is exploding oh my God this is totally insane this is not very good what am I gonna do okay uh it'll get better maybe or not okay so okay so here's the thing right now we see the person moving towards the obstacle what if I don't because the person has a forward velocity so I want to keep my physics kind of true to form with that forward velocity but what if I want to see the person in place and the obstacle moving instead well interestingly enough I think you know I'm kind of honestly I'm not really like a game programmer and there might there probably some very standard ways of doing these things and that I might be missing here but I might also just be coming up with these sort of things on the fly in the exactly the same way but the way that I would approach this would be rather than setting the velocity of this to zero and have giving this a velocity what I might do is just move almost our view of the scene always to be centered on this particular character and the way I can do that is with translate so the translate function I'm going to write this down the translate function and this is a kind of function that exists across most computer Graphics environments any type of opengl programming environment processing P5 open Frameworks probably like three jzz I don't know who knows they have their own way of day they with 3js 3js it whatever it has its own way of doing things um so I don't know what I'm talking about and this camera just went off because apparently I've been talking for a half an hour that's how I keep time this one's going to go off in a second there see now I'm turning it back on um okay so what translate allows you to do is move the point of origin so the point of origin by default in a canvas in the browser is the top left corner that is 0 0 so this character is drawn relative to 0 but what if I sort of think of instead of drawing the character relative to 00 but I always position the origin relative to where the character is so in other words if the character moves over here then I just want to move the origin kind of over here as well so that I always see so that I always see the character sort of staying in place now I I know that might not have been the most succinct or sensical way of explaining that but hopefully that made some sense to you um and uh oh my God I think I might actually hit the 100 people today um and so what I think I can do here is right here I can add a trans so let me just show you what I mean by this what if I were to just say translate 100 Zer so I move the origin negative 100 pixels to the left what does this do to our scene well everything is shifted over you can see how right let me do that again so um and I'm going to make this a variable I'm going to do something crazy uh yeah I'm going to show you some wacky JavaScript debugging craziness because I just I'm feeling like this is whatever today I'm just I'm warming back up to doing this on a weekly basis I answered one question for about a half an hour I'll probably be answering this question for another hour but I will go through the other questions uh I'm getting a lot of friend requests all of a sudden on Facebook okay I can't look at my phone during this thing okay um it's terrible unless unless I'm that's the universal symbol for Snapchatting I don't I really don't know what Snapchat is it's very embarrassing it's because I have gray hair okay uh x equals um x equals uh zero so I'm just going to put a translate here and what I'm going to do is I'm going to run this and I'm going to go to this little gear icon here so that I have a nice little JavaScript console and right now if I say x equals 00 you can see how I'm shifting things over right so I I'm a I'm live updating that of x to kind of move where that origin is to move my view of the scene like I need to move the C it's kind of like moving the camera over so I think a nice way of doing that wasn't the greatest demonstration I thought it was going to be much more interesting um um I think what what would work really well here is what if I just say person. position dox what if I always just offset the view by that person's Exposition only not its Exposition negative it Exposition because as that person's moving I want to offset the view further back so let's do that let's run this and you can see look at that now the um obstacle is moving so the physics haven't changed right the physics of this scenario are 100% the same it's just our view is changing and I could do like weird stuff like I could say like times. five and then you kind of have this like weird like the view is is like the camera's moving but not as fast anyway that's kind of that's kind of crazy it's sort of hard to see it just looks like they're Crossing but if there are multiple things moving at different speeds you might even get some kind of crazy Parallax effect but anyway I'm going to keep things simple right now and just keep this only I don't want the person I think all the way at the left I like them kind of shift it over so I'll just shift it over by like 50 pixels so you can see this is now my view of the game and what I want now is when I press the space bar for the the um user to jump and guess what this is actually super easy um it's not super easy in general but it's super easy because all of the work of building a kind of mini physics engine into this example is already there now admittedly I haven't I didn't do that work in today's session but if you're following along in the other materials you're kind of that's you're sort of ready for that so in other words we are this is easy because I already have this apply Force function so I have a mechanism for saying here's a vector stick that Vector in the object and normally that Vector is put in um normally I don't know what normally means but as you saw in my other examples that Vector you might be uh put in draw so for example ex Le if I were to say uh a force is create vector and I'm just going to give it like a little push to the right so that it goes faster um actually let's have it let's give it a little push to the left so that it slows down this will be interesting and then if I say person. apply Force you can see now the person is slowing down and suddenly moving backwards and it's weird because it really looks like that other thing is moving so hard to like get your I think get a like more complex scene with lots more things you would have more of the sensation of the of this particular character moving um but you can see here now if I could also do something like if Mouse is pressed only then will I apply this Force so here the person is moving ah I want to slow down slow down slow down slow down go back up back up back up back up you know what it would also help if the person was a little animation of like a running person um you know obviously there's visual cues you could add to this to make this better okay so you can see this is how we apply a force now now what I want to do is apply not a continuous force in draw over and over again but a force only when a certain event happens so what I'm going to do is I'm going to add a function um this is something specifically the p5js library that function is going to be called key pressed ah I can't boy I'm usually such a good typist and today it's just a disaster um and what I want to do is I'm just going to check like if the key is the space bar that's a really easy way of just checking like what key was pressed if the key is the the character space then this is where I'm going to apply this Force so what should that force be and I'm going to call that that a variable jump and I'm going to say create Vector now I want the user to do what jump in the air straight in the air so I'm going to just give it a force pointing up which is zero comma some some negative number now normally if you normally in a lot of my other examples you'll see generally forces have very small amounts 0.112 3 7 9 841 um I had a joke there that I forgot to do but I I'll make it happen later um it was a terrible joke anyway um so I just like lost my breath for a second train of thought um okay so normally you want sort of like a small number because if a force is something being applied continuously that thing is going into the object's acceleration continuously and numbers can get out of control very fast in a kind of canvas animation environment things going crazy but this is an instantaneous Force for it to have an effect it needs to be something rather large so let's make this a negative one and then I just want to say person. apply Force jump okay so let's see if this is enough for us okay here it comes uh there we go I'm jumping now interestingly enough I win I fly to the heavens that was an easy game on no obstacle will ever hit me again so why did that not appear to do anything like you might imagine it should well remember if if you apply a force to something moving up it's going to move up and if there's no Force to push it back down it's not going to move down that's like Newton's first law of motion um so we need to have gravity in this world and so in that is a force that should be applied continuously in the opposite direction so I'm going to create a vector and I'm going to make this sort of a small vector and I'm going to say person. apply Force gravity so now I want to continue continuously apply gravity oh I hit 100 people that's very exciting 103 people are watching YouTube I should check the chat is it still working uh okay now ah so look at that what happened now oh no right we've got a problem gravity was applying and there's apparently this is a quicksand simulation right so I don't have a sense of the ground here now this is where we get into a lot of trouble with our wanting to be true to the physics of the world you know in truth gravity is a force on me so my body is applying a force to the floor and then there's like this like the third lot of motion with the equal and opposite and there's you know tension force because the floor is attached to some be I don't I'm lost already but I think this is a scenario where hello it's just a rectangle on a screen so I think we could probably just say you know what don't go below the bottom so in that sense one of the things we could do and I'm this this particle this person object actually from the previous example has this edges function and so let's use that function and let's forget about this uh this aspect of it let's just say okay what do we do if this object is going below um falling below the uh the window itself so this old code here this old code Like This Old House anybody ever watched This Old House on PBS I kind of is this kind of like this old code instead of coding rainbow May should just called it this old code anyway let see if anybody gets that reference I don't even know if I do it's just sort of like this weird childhood memory that like popped into my head um so this old code I did have a point here was a bouncing code so something is falling its velocity reverses Direction and turns around so it's for bouncing but I don't really want bouncing here right now I mean I might want bouncing what I want is jump and stick stick The Landing kind of gymnastics stick The Landing so um so what I'm going to do actually is I'm just going to multiply its velocity times zero meaning if it hits the bottom its velocity multiplying its y component of its velocity makes its y velocity zero meaning it's instantly stuck to the bottom that's like the least accurate physics simulation thing I could ever possibly do but I think it will work in this case and then I also just want to like let's keep the position at the height so let's not get into like a weird thing where it's like a little bit below if it goes below at any point stop it from moving set it back to the bottom so now if we run this oh okay person is not defined so I must have a syntax error somewhere uh uh so this is this is a good thing to happen because this will happen to you um let's look what did what what did I add let's uh oh I think I oh I added I think I lost a curly bracket that's all I did so look this this closes this curly bracket this closes that Curly bracket and the I needed a curly bracket for this whole person Constructor function okay so let's run this now oh bye the quick sand is still active Okay so I think we have a problem which is uh that I just didn't call that edges function here so I also uh want to after I update I want to call edges to do that test for the edges and you can see the person is not falling more now I could press jump oh boy so that force is way too weak I'm not making it over that square anytime soon so let's kind of just play with some numbers here let's give it like make it 10 times as strong there we go whoa that was a really high jump oh quick uh okay so that worked um so you know know uh maybe let's try half split the difference it's pretty good I might have to actually time this correctly that was perfect okay that was very exciting okay so that's kind of the basic idea I kind of want to go further with this because I should add an array of obstacles and I should do a collision detection test I think maybe I'm going to kind of like pause here for right now maybe I would come back to this example a little bit later because I think there were some other questions that I wanted to look at I also I feel like maybe I just need like a moment to breathe um uh and um and uh kind of catch my train of thought so this is the basic idea you know there wasn't really a lot this is a kind of very I I would love it if some of you watching this perhaps when I post this code later uh take this code and kind of um um kind of put your spin on it add an animation add a character add a sound add uh multiple obstacles maybe think about the view the view is like a little bit uh we weird right now um but um anyway so uh okay so I'm going to just check this chat here to see if there's any questions uh okay um wow there's lots of people watching um let me go over to uh here let's see am I still streaming on Facebook with 70 viewers this is insane uh okay this is definitely the most people I've ever had watched live and there are 10 people on Twitch and um okay great uh all right um all right so let me okay so let me go back to the uh kadenz Forum I probably should put the questions here but I'm gonna I'm going to look for another question to answer and once I get to one hour so I'm at so I'm my my sort of plan I'm GNA have a little te here my plan for this was to do this for about two hours from 11 to 1 um again if those of you who are just sort of tuning in late so to speak I'm going to be doing these once a week or twice a week like I might do this hopefully do this again on Thursday or Friday this week um and I do have a long list of topics and various tutorials I'm kind of just getting back into the groove of things today so this is a little bit haphazard but I I do want to have a sort of longer term view of of topics sound being a big one sound in the browser p5js Sound Library um more connecting computer vision uh more git and GitHub uh Chrome extensions um some more service side programming with node stuff oh I have this crazy Minecraft tutorial idea because you know I'm trying to see if I can I don't know I'll talk talk about that later I'm too embarrassed to talk about it right now uh okay so let me go back to um the forums and I did post a uh thread where I ask people to ask their questions to the thread um ah okay so I'm what I'm going to do right now is kind of just um answer some of these questions a bit more uh rapid fire not necessarily um program them uh by the way I'm just curious um if this would interest people uh if I I was thinking of doing a coding challenge today of the and do reaction diffusion uh so I'm going to just do an image search so um reaction diffusion is a kind of um chemical reaction type simulation that you can do with all sorts of patterns like this and I was thinking of doing that as a kind of 15minute coding challenge toward the end of this session so if people are interested in that I got one request of a couple requests of that and I was like oh I've done that before I haven't done it in over a year or uh like uh so I have to like review it and look back at it so it'll be somewhat fresh but um but I do know it's possible I I have a processing example that does this so that's what I'm sort of thinking um okay uh okay so the question I'm um uh where are we here uh H so people seem interested yes people are saying good reaction diffusion okay so I'm going to answer a bunch more questions and then I'm going to uh do the reaction diffusion okay so let me read you a question uh taking for example 01 drag Force how to use shapes different shapes for liquid objects triangles or circles okay this is a great question so let me first show you this example uh and I'm going to go back to the P5 editor so one of the examples that I have in the nature of code materials is a drag Force which is like a air resistance or fluid resistance force if I run this example you'll be able to see this uh quite easily here so what do I have over here I have a scene with these falling circles one of the things interesting that you can see is that objects fall at the exact same acceleration due to gravity right it's that number that you could look up on Wikipedia that I can never seem to remember the acceleration due to gravity it's because even though acceleration is the acceleration of an object is it's ma the gravitational force divided by mass so you would think like well if a something's more massive it's going to accelerate less but remember gravitational force is scaled by mass so that Mass gets canceled out that's why you drop two things from the leading Tower of Pisa or whatever Galileo or whoever experiment that was they fall at the same acceleration now obviously air resistance and other funny factors can play a role and this demonstrates that precisely here because what happens when these two objects land in something like water the fluid resistance is going to cause a much greater acceleration on the smaller one which the less Mass so greater acceleration means greater acceleration in the reverse Direction meaning it slows down more and you can see the bigger one slows down less so this is an example I have and the the question really gets that you know the the example is really about how to calculate that force and just um you know in here in the there is a liquid object and you can see that force is calculated in here it is a constant coefficient of drag uh it's also it's also weighted according to how fast the object is moving the object is moving faster the force is greater the the speed squared actually but that's sort of the interesting bit really but I think if you want to be creative about how you use this um you might think about well what can be regions on the screen of resistance so you could imagine a where you're sort of have to steer around and you want to avoid you know pockets of mud or maybe there's some Icy patches that cause you to speed up you could actually even build that into the floor of that sort of jumping simulation we just did so um so anyway but this does a very simplistic thing which uh if I come back over here to the Whiteboard I really don't want to erase my picture of this bird somebody screenshot this and save it forever don't really do that uh um this eraser is not good but it will do for right now um so um okay so if we have a rectangle and if we have a circle how can we determine if the circle is inside the rectangle now I've did it in a very simplistic way I actually am not I bet you in my example I'm not taking into consideration that Circle size which is a key factor I'm just looking at this XY point right and it's very easy I can say if x if this is the liquid's X and this is the liquid's W and this is the uh particles position and it's positiony all I need to check is is position dox greater than x meaning it's on this side of the boundary is positionx less than X Plus width meaning is it on this side of the boundary and the same for y so I'm doing just a boundary test now really I should do something more sophisticated by thinking about uh um the radius with this circle to see if even if it like touches it slightly but you know in a lot of cases it doesn't really matter so um something you could do uh If This Were uh a for examp so this would also be not so hard If This Were if the sort of liquid area was a circle and this circle was moving toward it what I could do is just do a distance calculation P5 has a distance function so a distance calculation between those two uh elements and if the distance is greater than the sum of the two radi then they're overlapping then they're not overlapping if the distance is less than they are overlapping so you'll actually see this I've done this I feel like in the last month like in countless examples that I have in sort of basic intersection test somebody hopefully can maybe find a link to one of my videos that actually implements this but it's really just comes down to a geometry problem working with squares and circles is pretty easy uh any type of arbitrary geometry gets much more difficult however there sometimes a trick you can use so one thing I'll mention so you know we could sit here and be here all day to be like now let's look at a trapezoid with a triangle and I I just I don't think I it's a good use of the time to go through every one of those scenarios but um I would love to to do a bunch more but anyway but I do want to just mention I think what can sometimes be a useful trick I'm going to see if this paper towel which even though it's not very good for the environment I'm going to use this I'm going to reuse this single paper towel as many amount of times as possible but it works a little better to erase here's something that I might suggest you do so let's say you have the scenario where you have a a map of um of a of a continent and I'm going to try to draw like sort of Africa so let's say this is can you see that wow it's so light um I got to get some I got to get some better marker whiteboard stuff here so let's say um this is going to show my lack of job I'm not going to attempt to do any real geography um so let's say you have a bunch of I was just trying to not be us Centric picking a different continent than North America um so let's say you have some map and you're about to have a particle move through this map and maybe you're doing some kind of crazy data visualization where you know some type of data population data or you know um environmental science data is related to the kind of drag force that these regions have so you could start to think oh my God I need to know all of these vertices ah vertices so many vertices then I got to do this elaborate computational geometry math and blah blah blah to figure out is this circle in this one or this one here's another thing you could do what if you secretly or not so secretly had behind the scenes an image like a PNG file or a JPEG and that jpeg had exactly that same map with exactly the same dimensions that as the one that you're viewing on the screen now you could actually be the exactly the same one and what if all of the countries all of the regions on that map had a unique color so this is something you would make in like Photoshop or you would find you might just make this hard manually make this you can obviously make it algorithmically as well so each one of these had a absolutely completely unique color so what you could do is say I'm I'm a circle moving around the screen and I have an XY and wherever I might be I'm going to take my XY and look up that point in this offscreen SE secret image and I'm going to look up the pixel color and if that pixel color is that perfect beautiful pink that I've always loved then I know I'm over that country so I I think using pixel colors as is a nice way if you know this only works if this thing is static you know if it's changing then is your secret like color mapping thing also changing but this is I often it's useful to think is there a way that I can create this effect or use some sort of other type of data to help me through this problem so maybe one of you will now do this project which is a ma data visualization with uh things particles moving through it and the uh the uh drag force that each country or region applies to the particles moving is related to some piece of data I don't know if that would be interesting or not please try that to share it with me uh I don't I sometimes I have an idea it's usually my ideas are terrible but I never Implement my ideas so at least I could say them on the Internet on the Facebook and um somebody might uh make them okay uh I should really look at the YouTube chat I've been highly neglecting the chat uh and uh I I can't believe that I'm actually gaining viewers today I usually just lose viewers um okay so uh I don't see um um okay so I don't see uh any other uh comments in the chat right now related to that so I'm going to move on and go back to this forum so I'm going to read the next question which comes from Peter one thing I'm confused about is just sort of a general life thing I'm on the internet here and people are asking questions and sometimes they have like a handle like uh you know unicorn 57 um and then I'm happy to just say unicorn 57 writes in and ask and sometimes people have their actual name and even like an image so I don't know is it appropriate for me to pull up something that somebody wrote and their name is here or their image is here say their name it's nice to acknowledge people but I don't want I want to invade people privacy I never know what to do about that so I'm just using first names Peter writes um p5js editor on MacBook question I'm wondering why when I open up a I should like read these in voices or something not I can't do voices um like a British accent or a French accent would that be like obnoxious probably be obnoxious okay p5js editor on MacBook question I'm wondering why when I open up a project again it only shows one tab I can open each JavaScript module but I end up with several editor windows for one project how do I put the tabs back together yeah so you know you might be experiencing so this is a good question so one thing I should say is that um this this p5js editor is a pretty new project it's only maybe had a year of development it's also something that I think that we as a processing Foundation as an entity are questioning whether we're going to be able to maintain and support it in the future it takes a tremendous amount of time to maintain a desktop application that works across multiple um operating systems now of course we're keeping this up and using it and I'm using it in these videos in a lot of courses and people are using it right now but one of the things we're looking to do is actually develop a browser browser based editor as a more kind of sustainable model for p5js as a project of having a kind of beginner friendly editor so I could say a lot more about that I just wanted to sort of mention that but probably the best place for this question or discussion would be on GitHub itself um and uh I'll just show you guys where you can so if I go to github.com processing so I'm just going to show you this URL really briefly this URL github.com pressing this is all of the GitHub repositories for all of the processing Foundation projects um and you can see here uh processing p5js website processing docs which is like the reference and examples P5 J editor that's the one I want to go to for a second Library so the P5 J sound there's a lot of repositories here so if you're finding a bug or something confusing you can try to find the repository associated with that particular project and this is very confusing if you don't know which one tweet me I will help you uh so um uh don't the Facebook me though I I don't I'm afraid of the Facebook okay so um so p5g has editor I'm going to click on that and I'm going so first thing you could do by the way is you're really not sure if if you have a question or a bug is you could actually just go to forum. processing.org you know you could ask me this is the point you've you've done the right thing you've asked this question to me so um but I'm just kind of I'm very bad at answering questions succinctly I'm W gone off of the stent but I should mention that there are uh several categories here about p5js so on the processing form for p5js programming questions this is a good place to ask as well um and now but a bug would go here under issues or a feature question so this is a place and this can be you know this is an intimidating scary place there's lots of technical posts it seems like oh there's all these Advanced super programmers who are going to be you know think my question is stupid and I am telling you I've said this again in previous live streams it's just important to say this always that um the goal of the processing Foundation is to be a completely welcoming environment to to people of all skill levels and all backgrounds and all ages and you cannot do anything wrong here and we our goal and if and if something if youve felt that you did something wrong please let me know so I can help resolve and make it a happy friendly place a welcoming place an accessible place for everyone um but this is a place where you would post like I think I found a bug in the editor um and you would do that by clicking new issue so um but it does feel intimidating and I'm I'm here to help with that if it's an issue for you um so you might look around there might actually be a discussion this but one thing that you'll notice about is so this is my example right now 01 drag force and I'm actually operating with two tabs right here particle. Js liquid. Js so uh there are two tabs guide my code in two places so if I were to now quit the editor completely quit the editor and I were to go back and find that example which is this one 01 drag force and I were to just uh take that folder and drag it onto the editor it's it's going to open it up again it's opening it only on particle. JS now yours might actually look like this uh I'm doing something really quick show cyar off right it might actually suddenly open up like this and you think oh I lost liquid. JS but you didn't actually lose it it's just the editor is not currently not smart enough to remember which files you had open as tabs and reopen those for you so if I go to the finder those files are all there in the directory but the editor by default is kind of just picking one file to open I don't even know which logic it is so if you're seeing this the first thing to do is go to settings and go down here to show sidebar and turn the sidebar on because now you can see the directory structure here and if I were to click on liquid. JS I've got it back here so that tab is now here audio is still working everything's still working okay so that's how to get that tab back in view however there's more to this story so let's say what I want to do now is also add another tab so I'm going to use this little oh camera went off um am I back I'm back I'm gonna use this little plus sign here I'm gonna click that and I'm going to say um a particle and a a liquid and now we're going to have a rain rbow so I'm going to add a tab called rainbow. JS and I'm going to just in this tab write a function called rainbow and I'm going to say console.log rainbow okay so I just added some code that I want to make use of in my project so what I want to do is go back to uh sketch.jpg run it and all I'm going to get is this very sad error rainbow is not defined and I say to you world there is such a thing as a rainbow out there Rainbows are defined I love rainbows I'm a bit weird I know but uh rainbow is defined I defined it right here in this tab rainbow. JS look there's its definition so what's the problem here and I have gone over this before but I think it's worth mentioning because a lot of people have been asking this in Forum posts if you are at creating new JavaScript files what's the thing that's actually loading in the browser your JavaScript files aren't loading in the browser an HTML page is loading in the browser what page is loading in the browser this page index.html Why does it know about your JavaScript files is because the HTML page has a reference to each one of them has a reference to particles.js liquid. Js sketch. Js so this is a place where if you're adding new files you also need to make sure that there is a reference to them and so now I can reference that rainbow. JS file and I can uh run this again again and we can see there now is a rainbow rainbow is defined okay let me check the YouTube chat to see if there's any questions uh oh good I'm Hope Oh Peter did I answered your question how wonderful okay uh great now here's the thing I um yeah okay uh okay so I was gonna say something else uh okay so let me where am I I'm back in the form let me look at the next question okay so I'm um sorry I need a moment here I've been doing this for now an hour and two minutes straight this is a lot a lot hard I teach classes classes are like three hours long but the thing about this online live stream thing that I feel like there is no moment to breathe like I can't have dead air or be doing some other weird thing so it's definitely takes more different kind of energy I'm realizing uh okay um llan asks I was just wondering I haven't actually read these I should read these questions in advance I need like a screener question screener like Brian L I love Brian L do you love Brian L okay I was just wondering if using a gravity well or two and a particle class it would be possible to make a Spyro graph with the principles you covered in session two oh boy this is a hard question let's Google spirograph and look at some pictures I think that'll help this is this is going to be a good uh coding challenge so yes so look at this interesting so these are great how uh 100 yes yes yes yes and yes and in fact uh P5 art on Twitter um what I would recommend to get some effects like this is look at the attraction ex the gravitational attraction example so the gravitational attraction example Works let's try this blue pen uh with this idea of an attractor and an object so if the object is attracted to the center it's just going to move like this it's going to get pulled into it then it's going to go past it and then it's going to get pulled back it's going to go past it then it's going to get pulled back almost like a spring now I'm not actually simulating a spring Force although that would also be a great thing I would love to do that as an example today um but what if you give and this was a question also asked on the Forum so you're the effect that you're going to get of this object moving is just going to be in a straight line back and forth with gravitational attraction and actually why not let's go um let's go let's go actually do this so I'm going to grab my um gravitational attraction example and I'm going to open this one up in the editor let's just go to the editor and do command o and go to uh gravitational attraction and run this okay so you can see what this example is doing by default it's showing you um this kind of object orbiting in a way this particular circle now this appears much like planetary orbits and you know the formula for gravity is in there much like that formula for gravity is in there in the universe but there's many things about this that are highly inaccurate in terms of an actual you know true to life physics simulation it's you know but it's it's kind of along the way there but it's let's let me go back and uh to this example and what I'm going to do is I'm going to look at this particle object and I'm going to change its initial velocity from one comma 0 to 0 comma 0 so it has no initial velocity to start and let's run it again so this is what talking about with no initial velocity it's just going to move back and forth because and it's you know it doesn't it's it's eventually probably going to it's doing some kind of crazy thing like it goes much further on one side and you know there's all sorts of rounding stuff and I'm using some strange constraints so who knows why all this is happening but you can see that it's kind of moving back and forth so that initial velocity if I come back over here gives it a place to move to start so that as it's being pulled in it's kind of doing this so now I'm not doing it drawing it accurately but you could imagine what if you give it an initial velocity and let's give it a much bigger initial velocity to start right uh or or um that's fine just leave it let's you know you can see this is what it's doing now it has that initial velocity so it's kind of orbiting so what I would suggest you try to do is number one is uh draw Trails so you could do that by not erasing the background so it smears and I could actually really uh quickly um just make that happen for us by putting the background in setup and we can kind of see what sort of pattern are we going to get um so that's sort of option number one is you can kind of not erase the background other thing you might try is you know what's a good initial velocity what's a good uh What are some good constraints um what happens if you do multiple ones of these what happens oh you're going to get really really nice patterns if you have multiple attractors in different places um so um and uh what there have been a lot of projects uh in along this vein this is a quite an old project I'm going to say I think it's by Tom Carden Metro and and probably collaboration with some other people uh metropop denim I'm going to pull this up let's see uh um so this is a project that was kind of a process I think it was done I'm pretty sure it was done in processing because I seem to remember it being on the processing exhibition but uh right um so I'm just going to look at this image and kind of zoom into it so this is the result of I you know I can't speak to 100% exactly how this was done but my impression of this is this was using attraction forces with multiple invisible attractors everywhere and releasing a lot of particles into the system and just seeing their Trail and drawing nice sort of alpha Blended line Trails all over the place so you might sort of see and then this was combined with a fashion photography uh and so if I go back to that uh Google image search you can see how um uh you can see some of these images here with different fashion photography but it would be interesting to think about what if you you had sort of a a dress or a shoe or some item of clothing or some other pattern and you actually placed or a person's silhouette and you place those attraction points along Contours or on the tips of fingers what type of kind of or you know you did this in real time with a connect so as you're moving your hands your hands are the attractor see go and make these projects see if they're interesting um so there's a lot of Rich possibilities there I would however recommend that if you're doing this and wow it's kind of amazing to me how stable this particular uh orbit is I I assume it's going to get off over time like if we watch this if I set this running for 24 hours it's eventually going to like sort of fill in the whole screen um but one thing I would recommend is looking into not using this not erase the background technique so and I actually have another example there's a tutorial it's on YouTube If you Google you know shiftman object Trails um what if you actually have the particle store an array of all of its historical positions um you know it sort of depends what you're doing if your goal is to make a static image like a big poster then just not erasing the background is going to be fine but you have a larger animated system with other things moving and you want to see trails you're going to need a more flexible way of doing that okay um great I think that answers that question where am I let me check this chat uh uh okay um yes so by the way um so some people in the chat are rightfully mentioning that you could could absolutely just do this with uh uh oscillating simple harmonic motion and oscillating Behavior so using S and cosine functions and I have I do if um I have some other YouTube tutorials that do that as well and um um yeah okay um let me check how life is going here on the internet so let me go back uh comment was deleted let's go down okay so there's one more question on this thread that I think I'll get to um and then we'll see if have questions in the chat and then maybe we'll do the um diffusion thing my brain is starting to melt like talking straight for an hour and uh 10 minutes okay how's audio video picture I don't look too like red and sweaty a little bit hot in here okay um let's see now where where's the world where in the World is Carmen San Diego go my brain uh okay one more question uh okay so this comes from Luca uh uh by the way I think I'm getting a bald spot can you guys see it maybe you can't see it um uh why sometimes the speed of our programmed objects seems to suddenly go crazy objects go out of control and we have to use function like limit is it just a float number is it just a floating uh Point numbers approximation problem okay I'm going to read the whole question that's part one of the question as this strange Behavior can sometimes happen while a program is running is it safe to always constrain velocity in our physics engine simulations how do we choose the limit is it purely an empirical trial and error approach or is there a better way this is a great question um and this is like this is like a I love this question because it's like a philosophical question like I almost don't have to type any code or I mean we could start opening up examples and try different constraints but it's really a sort of pH philosophical question and I think there is this sort of Continuum um you know I am my name is Jane and I am working at Nasa and we are trying to figure out how to get this rocket to you know properly go around this asteroid and uh do some important scientific thing you know my name is fr FR Francis I'm coming I know I need these names whatever I am a happy golucky person sitting at my computer making some goofy algorithmic art I think the answer to that that question is very different for those two different people you know there might certain scenarios might require a more significant amount of rigor in and I I really hate that word rigor but I think it's probably an appropriate use of it here in terms of the level of scientific accuracy um you know by definition the way I am doing my examples is scientifically inaccurate there is no way for me to make it accurate because there's no such thing as like a flat twodimensional I mean there isn't theoretic okay let me even let me put it a different way the draw Loop is frame by frame animation so I'm showing you a picture then I'm taking a break for one 160th of a second and showing you another picture then I'm taking you a break for one 160 a second and showing you another picture much like a flip book here here I'm gonna juggle here is a demonstration of juggling these are kind of hard to juggle but it's working I just showed you like an animation you're watching it as a video but in real life that's happening continuously I didn't toss this thing and take a break and wait and then it moves a little more so that fact of this it's called Oiler integration this this model of physics of this step by step this time increment being 1 160th of a second is by definition makes everything wildly not like the real world but are you really complaining when you're watching this not so much because it's kind of doing the things you want to do now this the fact that we're starting from this place of inaccuracy means there's all these moments where um you know things aren't going to behave like we might expect or don't have the feeling of the real world so we do things like say velocity. liit or constrain this or like add this fudge Factor here and personally from my standpoint these are all excellent things to do in the scenario of I'm making an experiment an interactive exhibition I'm just trying out an idea I'm learning about programming um you know a lot of times I'll hear people say to me okay well I did this and it looks great but I cheated and if it looks great you didn't cheat you did it it's all cheating right it's all none of this is real there is no wizard behind the curtain or there is just wizard behind the curtain and The Wizard is you right it's all cheating so um I think in that case it's it's good practice to learn about these sort of limitations now sometimes the limitations will cause you other problems like in my jumping program I just have it stop immediately but what if I want you know it's actually suddenly there's like a water and so when there's water it goes through now I need to add some other code so sometimes the limitation will cause you another problem down the road and so it's just this kind of um Balancing Act and you it's a lot of back and forth so my General answer is there is no answer it's Case by case basis give it a try you need that now again though in certain scenarios you know U you need a higher level of accuracy and in that case it might be you could make the argument that JavaScript in the browser isn't the place for some of these more kind of rigorous scientific simulations and you know you might really need to apply the sort of more time uh calculus formulas to not have this kind of like step by step anyway so you go down that road but I I don't I don't ever go I don't you know I just I don't go down that road I sometimes maybe I do maybe maybe it's it's it's it's beautiful down that road and I should take a peek down that road and I I think there are lovely people down that road and sometimes you might need to go down that road but the context of what I'm doing here in the sort of coding rainbow world is to kind of generally find the sort of quick and dirty uh um uh um solutions for these kind of problems that create the feeling of the real world simulation rambling rant over let's see I bet you I lost just like 15 viewers during that uh yeah I did but they still have above a 100 people so um okay uh um all right so that was that question um I'm checking um I'm checking the world of uh oh gain to the m oh so some people maybe on Facebook it's quiet the audio is okay for people I I'm I'm afraid to make it louder so I'm just seeing some comments um I don't know if is there a live chat there's I'm sort of curious but I'm going to not look right now okay um okay so I think now I'm at an hour and 15 minutes I think it would be a good time today so what I want to do now is I want to look at my I I got through I think a good amount of questions I'm sure there are more I will answer them in the Forum by typing but what I want to do right now is a couple things one is I want to close out out this and I want to go to a URL that I keep which is my list of topics so this here is uh where I'm kind of keeping a list of topics as people send me suggestions uh and I think the one I'm going to do today is reaction diffusion which is right down here I have smaller topics I think I did uh I want to do K you know a lot of these U Google Maps ap5 Voice synthesis different editors sort of did that Twitter Bots there's some more stuff Chrome extensions Raspberry Pi neural networks more uh text stuff and node more computer vision other topics oops this GitHub for poets thing oh GitHub Pages I've got to do okay so this is my list of topics I I'm just sort of scanning this through because I would um love to hear feedback from you guys and uh and suggestions always uh but I think what I'm going to attempt to do is do the reaction diffusion algorithm and I'm going to do it as a coding challenge meaning um I'm going to kind of get myself up in I'm going to I'm going to take about 10 to 15 minutes right now to kind of find my old code for it look at it look at some web pages that have nice documentation of the algorithm uh kind of refresh my brain about it a little bit understand the code talk to you about it answer questions and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to stop and I'm going to just like clear everything and I'm going to um then program the whole thing from scratch in what I hope will be about 10 to 15 minutes and that's that will be a standalone video tutorial that we'll Live on YouTube that's my plan uh and I'm going to keep the uh YouTube chat open here um um and there okay so um you know these kind of classic generative algorithms tend to work really well for these coding challenges I still really need a haircut hopefully today I can get a because I feel like I like to look nice for these live streams I don't know how I don't know how possible that really is but you know to some extent uh by the way everyone keeps asking me for this a agario.io what is that some game no what is it agario agar.io oh yeah the Smash Hit game this is some game everyone keeps I gota I'll take a look at this later um okay so let me do a few things here let me first open up processing and um oh uh yes do want processing so I'm opening up processing I am going to I need like a short a short break here just sort of like mental break here so I'm going to uh clean the Whiteboard how's the light over here I'm just curious is the like can you see stuff on the Whiteboard does it seem like weird and shadowy I'm gonna clean this because I'm sure we'll need a diagram um you know some other topics that I've thought of that I really need to get to at some point are um how to deal with multidimensional arrays in JavaScript because it's really weird compared to how because Java array JavaScript arrays are these kind of like fungible flexible things um and so how to deal with that as opposed to like in processing your Java where it's much simpler another topic that's come up a lot recently that I want to get to and maybe I would do today I only I have about a half an hour left so I definitely need to uh I want to do today at some point is um how to deal with optional arguments to function in JavaScript have I done that before I don't think so okay so do I have processing open now I do oh I should get the update what am I in 3.1 there's a 3.1 and there's also now a 3.1.1 which actually had some key critical bug fixes in it but I'm I think I'm just going to uh to save time right now I'm not going to download the new the newer version I'll do it afterwards so I'm going to go to um uh Hollow so um hollow hollow Hol Hollow is a um creative coding magazine that's coming out soon and I did some images for them and one of them was reaction diffusion so let me open this up and let me run this okay so this is my existing example that I made a little over a year ago that is doing the reaction diffusion algorithm and you can see that okay so what's going on here is that there is a window it's a grid of pixels those pixels have a grayscale color and they're colored according to an algorithm that algorithm being this reaction diffusion algorithm so um now the way that the what this what this is like is you can think of let's say this table is my processing window and I I have some sort of chemical a in here so I'm going to pour chemical a onto the table and maybe the table is filled with chemical B so reaction diffusion refers to the reaction between those chemicals and how like chemical a also diffuses so which how is chemical a taking over is B taking over or is a kind of going away and dying or is B going away and dying so and you can really think of it almost as just like one if there's a lot of chemical a we have black if there's no chemical a we have white and if there's some amount in between we have grayscale and you can see that this particular kind of chemical reaction simulation creates these kind of Labyrinthian like um images and so this is like incredibly the sort of like Drop Dead standard classic result but you can modify this to have it behave in different ways how do you you know uh you could seed it again with the Contours of a human body to create this sort of like portrait of somebody you could alter the color in different ways so my hope for you if I can get this tutorial done is that you can um uh find creative twists off this algorithm but for me I'm going to just sort of do the sort of classic one um Okay so so let's look so I this says written entire whenever I did this over a year ago written entirely based on this so let's go to this URL and let's read over this URL to help um jog my memory and uh let's see if it matches with what I had just sort of said so let me make this a bit bigger reaction diffusion tutorial this is great thank you Carl Sims for this page that I'm now using in this video tutorial a simulation of two virtual chemicals reacting and diffusing on a 2d grid using the gray Scott model okay so that's an important thing that I should mention this idea of reaction diffusion is totally generic this idea of chemical a being fed in at some rate so there's a feed rate that's a key concept um B's get converted into a if B reproduces using a as food so chemical B is removed at a kill rate so this sort of like feed and conversion is the reaction and the kill rate the sort is the kind of diffusion um and so there are different models give different kind of chemicals that'll produce different kind of results one of them being gray Scott which I assume is named for some people with the names gray Scott and we could go read about that I'm assume we get further along there might be more of the formula okay so diffusion refers to both chemicals diffuse so uneven concentration spread out across the grid so this is really by the way a cellular automata simulation because it's a grid each cell having a state the state you know if you looked at some of my other videos about cellular automata like the states are zero or one white or black and we get these kind of nice patterns here it's a kind of state That's a Some number between zero a floating Point number between zero and one so um how much of chemical a how much of chemical B um okay the system is approximated by using two numbers at each grid cell so you can see here that there is some amount of chemical a and some amount of chemical B and we'll kind of normalize those values between zero and one and when a grid of thousand of cells ass simulated larger patterns emerge and you can see here that the color the amount of yellow the amount of blue is probably being determined based on the amount of A or B uh I'm looking um to see if there are any questions okay so ah this is where we get to the sad place okay let's everybody take a deep breath oh okay we're gonna look at this thing called the lassan formula and we're gonna just everything's G to be okay I don't remember it I understood this at one point hopefully it's my brain is going to come back so the grid is repeatedly updated using the following equations to update the concentrations of A and B in each cell and model the behaviors described above okay so here's the thing so what we need to do and let's use the Whiteboard for a second is let's think about what it means means to be a given cell I'm going to by the way I'm going to do this all again just uh I'm kind of like warming up to it and then I'm going to like record it uh so let's say we have a given cell and it has some concentration of a and some concentration of B oh sorry some concentration of B and we have moments in time we have time zero time one time two so has some concentation of a at Time Zero come some of B at time zero so what we need to figure out how to do is calculate the concentration of a oops sorry at time one and this is going to be I can't believe I'm about to use some sort of math notation here because I generally try to avoid that and I'm afraid of that it's going to be a function of the concentrations of those chemicals at um at time zero so this cell's new concentration of A and B is some for formula some mathematical thing that we're going to put our code of the previous generation so we have this idea of generations um frame by frame by frame that's why you're seeing this kind of spreading out now there's more to it than this though because I'm pretty sure and this is where the lassan stuff comes in that we also have this thing where this cell that I'm talking about here is like this cell here that lives on a grid so not only is it a function of its own previous chemical state but it's also a function of the chemical states of the neighbors around it because all of these chemicals are moving and combining as sort of neighboring ways so that's what we need to figure out how to solve okay so um so this we can understand this formula now the new values are equal to the old values plus d so those are diffusion rates those are going to be constants numbers we make up now these are 2D laian functions which give the difference between the average of nearby grid cells and the cell okay we can handle that two D Lan functions would give the difference between the average of nearby grid cells in this cell so what does that mean all right here's my grid let's just think about a let's say the cell that we're on has like an a value of 0.2 and this has like 7 and 0.9 and 0.1 and 3 and one and zero and z and zero so conceivably what this means is let's add up all of these neighbors and then 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and then divide by eight so we want to get the average of the neighbors and then have take that minus the current and that's the that's the difference the Lelo function the difference between the average of the neighbors and the center which makes sense it has to do with like what's the chemical reaction is based on my I'm a cell what's my uh amount of chemicals and what's happening in my my neighbors and what's the difference between those two things is going to cause a reaction so I think we can put that and then back here a * b ^ 2 we see that this is the same this is the just the current and then plus F now what's f f is a feed rate so that's also some constant that we're going to put in and then uh K is the kill rate which is also some constant that we're going to put in and then uh and this is the reaction but it's really just this formula um and that's really it and then delta T so this is really key delta T again this goes back to something I was talking about earlier which is what's the unit of time right from one moment to the next and for us that's really every frame um every frame of Animation 160 every 160th of a second so I think we can get this formula in our code so and then uh and then you can see here here are some typical values so these are the typical diffusion rates here's a typ typical feed rate here's a typical kill rate so you can see the these are probably the rates that I'm using in my code and uh and then the lassan is performed with a 3X3 convolution 3x3 convolution that is this thing over here 3x3 my phone is buzzing oh is is the audio no the audio is still working okay I got whenever I start to hear my phone buzzing a lot in the past that's meant that um that's meant that um uh that's meant that something went wrong but uh nothing seems to have gone wrong now by the way um maybe I was in okay so the convolution center weight in negative one adjacent neighbors 02 oh interesting and diagonals 0. five so one thing it's saying here about this okay oh world oh life you are you are ever so more complicated than you seem to be we're we're going to be able to do this though um so let's talk about what a convolution is for a second because this is actually this is how things work in image processing so um let's think about this for a second a 3X3 Matrix is here and a convolution is an operation where you take every single value in this entire Matrix apply a weight to it multiply by a weight add them all together to get a new value for that Center let me try this side for this Center oh that's better for this Center uh element so let's say you're doing image processing and you're doing a blur the weight for each one of these would be one nth because you're taking an average there's nine cells and you want one nth of each or add them all together divide by nine get the average a sharpening filter would be like a negative weight to the center and positive weights to the outside because you want a pixel to be more different than its neighbors a blur you want to be more similar to its neighbors so this same type of operation is used here it's a convolution and what it's saying is if I go back here that the weights are where did it have it um uh Center weight is netive one meaning we're doing the difference we're subtracting out the center adjacent neighbors 02 and diagonals 05 so that means we give 2 2 2 2 05 0.05 0.05 0.05 and then the center is negative 1 so those are the weights so we take the chem the amount of a here and multiply it by that the amount of a here and multiply by that the amount of a here and multiply and add everything together now interestingly enough I hope and I'm almost sure that these will all add up to one right um add up to zero actually so 2 plus 2 plus 2 plus2 that's 08 right and then this plus this is 0.1 plus this plus this is 0. 2 so we get one and then negative 1 is the center so we get zero so all of these together those weights all add up to zero which makes a lot of sense perfect okay so that's what this lloan function is going to do uh and that's really it and then it's just a matter of figuring out how to color the cells based on the amount of a chemical and you can be pretty creative with that and um so and you can see here through this page I encourage you to continue and look uh at how you can get these sort of different patterns okay deep breath here so I think I I now have a sense of this and I'm curious what your questions are um and then we're going to then I'm going to kind of do this again but kind of gloss over some of these details a bit more and just get to the programming but let's look at the processing version um which by the way you can see what it ended up with now um and let's look at the code for a second just to see how I did it oh dear Deary me okay so there's so many different ways you could do this um so I have made a twodimensional array which is the grid and I need two of them because I want to store the previous generation of chemical values as I'm calculating the next so I have this snapshot of what the screen looks like now and I'm filling in all the new values in the next one and then I update the window with the next one and then I kind of Swap and make the old array the next one that sort of thing so I have two and then uh each one of these things gets to be a a cell object so the cell object is actually just an amount of chemical a and chemical B so in jav I'm going to do this in JavaScript I think um I don't know how slow it's going to be we'll find out um but this is such a simple object I won't even need to do this whole like class thing that'll be nice now here we can see look at this these are those constants I'm using that came directly from Carl Sims page I've got the diffusion rate for a the diffusion rate for B the feed rate and the kill rate so these are just constant values and you can see like what happens if I so if I run this you can see that uh this is it running but like I could just be like hey let's change the feed rate to that and you can see like nothing happens so there are sort of like known values that will do certain things and a lot of them probably just tend towards nothing and then here in update uh one thing I'm doing is skipping the edges so that's like kind of a simple way of doing stuff and then I I have to look at the previous um in order to get the new one and then I get the previous values now I'm doing boy am I doing this in a silly way but this works so this is that llas function I take all of the neighbors and I'm not I could do like a nested Loop here which would be much smarter but this is very explicit where I'm saying add the center value time ne1 I + 1 is the one on the right times 0 2 IUS one is the one on the left time 0 2 so I add those all up then I add up all the B's and then I do this exact formula so this is the exact formula that is whoops that is written right here it's here and by the way this is my unit of time one what happens if I increase the unit of time woo wacky what happens if I decrease the unit of time just probably the same thing but my much slower maybe anyway uh and then I'm doing then I then I um this is my fudge Factor I'm just kind of constraining the values between zero and one in case they go off and then I'm just drawing and I'm setting each pixels to a color which is based on a minus B * 255 that's weird why a minus B uh interesting um I I think I just like probably picked that arbitrarily is a always greater than oh because if it's Le if that's less than zero it'll just be black um yeah so anyway but I could do like B minus a and that's the opposite I could just do a that's the amount of a so anyway so how you do the coloring I I don't remember I must have come up with that or I got it from somebody else okay so that's the idea I think I'm ready for this now so uh I'm going to I need to take like a two minute kind of just like headspace Break um to get it set up for this um and uh I see some people asking about 3D which is interesting um and then so I'm going to get set up to do this example oh one thing I have to figure out like why do I have this pattern so what did I do at the beginning at the beginning uh ah I picked 10 random spots to give a starting amount of B so they all start with one zero so everything starts with full chemical a and then I add chemical b in a bunch of different spots 10 random spots so that's that's useful to see as well um okay so that I think everything's here so um okay so I'm gonna sort of uh pause for a moment um not pause I mean I'm still going to be here but I'm going to check I'm going recycle the cameras I'm going to check to make sure the microphone batteries are still working I'm going to drink a little water I'm going to get get my p5js setup going um and etc etc so give me a minute here I'll leave this minimized Talk Amongst yourselves I'm starting to feel a little this is bad to do the coding challenge it's 1248 the very end I should have done this at the beginning because I I feel a little brain dead right now but we'll see how this goes okay so I'm going to close all this um let me close this um let me do you hear that stomach Rowling sound uh let me uh what I'm actually going to do right now is I'm just going to go to just to make sure I have the most recent p5js I'm going to do this and it should come with uh if I download it it should come with this thing called empty example which I'm going to put onto the desktop and I'm going to call this um reaction diffusion and I'm going to minimize this and I think I'm going to use should I use adom or I'm either gonna use adom or Sublime a little more comfortable with Sublime Text but I've been trying to use Adam more recently I'm going to use Sublime just because I'm a little more comfortable with it uh and um the best way to get comfortable atam to use it I'm going to desktop desktop desktop reaction diffusion whoops reaction diffusion open okay so now I need sketch. JS perfect uh now I need to run a little local server I'm going to just run this in Chrome uh uh so let me open up terminal if you're wondering what I'm doing right now I do have a video tutorial about this which is uh a way of let me make this uh bigger for you guys so you can at least see what I'm doing uh a way of running a local python server on your machine to do um local development uh and I want so now I need to go to the desktop and reaction and do python DM a simple HTTP server so I should be able to minimize this now and do Local Host and open up the console that doesn't matter that would go away it went away and then if I say create canvas 400 400 I'm also going to say pixel density one I'm just going to add this in here I'll mention Y in a second background 51 great um okay uh okay so now I'm ready this is let me let me do it lower resolution because I I'm just concerned about speed because I can always oops I can always do this okay and then I think that's good I think I'm ready to program this from scratch which is a little bit scary but I think I'm gonna do it okay um um people are asking to send Pizza by the way I don't I don't eat pizza I'm nondairy I'm lactose intolerant don't don't say anything it's very kind of you um just if you want to do something nice spread the word uh you can you can support my patreon when I start that up um but it was nice of people okay so I'm checking okay so this microphone only has two bars which concerns me a little bit this one has two bars as well okay I'm gonna um I'm going to mute sound for a second um because I don't want to blow out your ears so I'm about to mute sound I'm going to replace the batteries here e test test test I think I'm back but it's so much cooler in the other room it's very hot in here but I'm coming to a close today I'm at an hour and 45 minutes this is probably going to take a half an hour although I you know I really want these videos when I do these sort of like short nugget algorithm videos I really want them to be less than 20 minutes so we'll see see how that goes um I'm going to um clean this whiteboard again I will probably draw some of the similar diagram okay okay so let me get now this pen is the good one the good side um come back over here it's amazing that I haven't had to pee this whole time I always have to pee in the middle of these but somehow even I'm drinking all this tea I said that I'm totally gonna have to go okay um okay I think I'm ready now so what I need is also uh this I can close this I can close this I can close I need that Carl Sims link um right I was just there here it is okay uh oh yeah one thing I wanted to look up was Grays Scott I I wanted to just just understand the I mean I might not mention this but I wanted to get the sort of historical um the his historical origin of the gray Scott but oh there's some interesting other this is a nice way to look at the formula as well um this doesn't seem to be coming up with anything uh here we go well I'll look this up later not doesn't really matter well so this is interesting you can see different ways of coloring stuff and different other models I I hope that people do some nice variations of this you could do this in like webg and shaders all sort of fancy way we're just going to do the very basics in p5js oh great Scott yes coding challenge okay F Al here we go everybody let me cycle yeah I know the elevator music I got to get the sound system going in here um that's really you know one of my issues is that I whenever I have time I just want to like record more videos but I need just a day where I do things like get organized get the connect set up get the Raspberry Pi set up to be able to use those in the videos I need to spend a day like getting the sound system in here working better but such is life um hopefully I'm going to have some more time now that it is uh the end of May and June is coming up um jury duty is going to be a problem though okay uh all right here we go um reaction diffusion gray Scott model we're gonna do this in 15 to 20 minutes and then I'm going to say good night and goodbye or good afternoon good morning whatever time it is some of you if you're watching this must be getting to the evening if you're in Europe if you are you you probably can't watch this unless you're on a VPN in China but it would be 100 a.m. for you I just there I'm I think I'm over my jet lag though nobody cares about this okay uh so reaction diffusion oops Local Host we go and Sublime is up okay and here we go coding rainbow take one take two take three hi everybody okay mental note do the complicated algorithm coding challenge at the beginning next time okay I'm going to do this this is going to happen I don't need to press anything just need to start okay okay so if the um I'm gonna keep this chat kind of view open to see it in the corner of my eye if there's an audio problem or an issue um put like just like flood the chat with like tons of crazy emojis but don't do that otherwise that and I what I'm going to do is I'm gonna uh I'll actually make it much bigger this is going to be my new system oh actually no this is not working hold on comments below okay okay here we go so I I'm not looking the good news is I'm not looking at my video because that always distracts me I just see the chat there and um so if the sound goes bad oh okay well hold on before I start somebody is saying the mic seems a bit quiet can you all let me know I did just swap out the battery so it could have changed something oh you know what it is quite low compared to usual let me move this back up I'm making this louder just to warn you guys okay I I made okay so don't Emoji now okay is is everything fine is there any dist Distortion in the Audio I actually just turned it up because I I didn't realize I had it turned down quite a bit um yeah so I think it should be better now okay Mike is fine yes okay here we go everybody stret you know I was at this uh construction site yesterday and they had this poster of different stretches I think everybody take a moment and stretch stop and stretch gonna stretch the good news is I do these standing up so I feel like if I was like sitting down for like hours in these tutorials kind of like moving around a lot you should if you're watching sitting down you should stand up and move around for a little bit okay like let me let me fix my hair makeup makeup nobody's coming right where's my hair and makeup Department okay okay you have a standing desk okay I'm now I can really see by the way this is brilliant for what I just did with the chat I just zoomed in on and have like a huge font so I could just read it easily from over here I what I W really want to do is put the chat like up here so that I can look at the chat and still be kind of like looking at the camera because I kind of do this a lot okay I got to just do this here we go hello welcome to another coding challenge with me Dan okay in this today's coding challenge I'm going to look at the reaction diffusion algorithm it's a pixelbased algorithm that allows you to generate interesting patterns that look like up top and it's what it's uh uh what it's doing is it's modeling a chemical reaction so it's this idea of having in your canvas let me just start over kind of like what am I doing here at the beginning I kind of want I I want to have um I think what I would like to have open is did I I want to have this as a visual reference open yeah so I'm going to have this running right here okay oh it's going to run really slow in JavaScript I bet but we'll sort of see okay um so I'm going to put this here and I'll zoom in a little bit okay must have proper Opening screen okay here we go again everybody just I'm gonna do the camera one more time so I think I wasted so much time there I'm excited for this one okay make the same bad joke with me Dan whatever hello and welcome to another coding challenge uh in this coding challenge I am going to look at the reaction diffusion algorithm so I have a version of it running right over there that is a processing sketch that is implemented the reaction diffusion algorithm I'm going to implement it in Javas script uh do it from scratch in this video and you can see that this allows you to create this interesting kind of Labyrinthian uh uh visual in your canvas now there's a lot of different ways that you can apply colors and get different qualities to the image but I'm going to look at the sort of core classic reaction diffusion algorithm using the gray Scott model I will include some links below to reference Pages the one that I will build the code based on is right here in the browser the Carl Sims a Carl Sims tutorial page um and so the idea here is that I'm going to just sort of look at the drop dead simple classic algorithm black and white pixels only and then hopefully you after watching this and using the code might come up with some other creative uses and applications of it so let's try to understand first what this algorithm actually is and so I'm going to close this window out and look at this diagram so the idea of reaction diffusion is kind of like you have your screen and you're about to pour some chemicals into it and those chemicals are going to react and there's going to be a lot of chemical a and then less of chemical B and they're going to react and diffuse and that's ort of thing and then based on the how those chemicals are arranged in the screen in this sort of like dish petri dish of your canvas I'm going to we're going to set a color so if there's a lot of chemical a we're going to make the pixel black if there's no chemical a we're going to make the pixel white and kind of everywhere in between so that's the idea here now there are a lot of different um kind of key pieces here and let's just look at this quick diagram here thank you again Carl Sims for providing the diagrams for this video um chemical a so um the way it's going to work is the canvas is going to be filled with chemical B and then we're going to start to pour chemical a into the canvas the reaction aspect is chemical A and B reacting and maybe a is turning into B and the sort of diffusion in this way is that chemical B is also going to get kind of like removed uh from it so there are some there are some key constants in the system that are numbers that you're going to see in the code one is the feed rate which is how fast are we pouring in chemical a and then another is called the kill rate I wish there was a nicer name for that but that's what it's called which is how what is the rate the chemical B is being removed so this is the idea now um so and you can see here what we're going to do is each each cell is going to have a certain amount of chemical a and amount of chemical B and those values are going to have a range between zero and one uh one being a lot of chemical a zero being none and then that amount is going to be used to set the color for a pixel and so you can see here uh how this how this kind of works we're going to all this in code now how look at this now we have this like terrifyingly scary looking formula but we can tackle this formula I'm gonna right here I'm here with you to tackle this complicated looking formula so let's put putting that aside let's kind of make a quick diagram so the way that I'm going to build this in code is I'm going to have a twodimensional array meaning I'm going to have a data structure that's going to keep track of uh each spot in that data structure is going to keep track of an individual cell call that a cell each cell is going to have an amount of chemical a and an amount of chemical B so what I need to do is understand uh if CH if there are moments in time there are Generations This Moment In Time next moment in time so Moment In Time a z moment in time b0 what I need to understand is how do I get the amount of a for Moment In Time One based on some function of the amount of of a and the amount of B at time zero so this is what we're looking at and in fact over here that's what this formula is showing you the new value of a equals all this stuff based on the previous value of a and b and some other constants so this is what we need to do but there's a bit more to it than this so you know I could say like oh A1 equals the average of a0 plus b 0 you know divided by two this could be our formula this would be a lot easier to implement so that formula is just like this but a lot more compliment complicated so now but there the reason why there's more to it than this is because we have this scenario here of an individual cell we have to apply something called a convolution you're going to see I'm going to show you in a moment it says a convolution of a 3X3 Matrix all this scary sounding stuff so here is a 3X3 Matrix and this is a given cell and what I want to know is what is this cell's new values of A and B based on its previous value of a and b but not just it I need to know also based on its neighbors so these chemicals are reacting and combining in a given cell also with what are the chemicals next to it so the con a convolution means take every single one of these cells and multiply it by some weight so if I were blurring an image for example I could use a blur as blur meaning the average of a convolu of of a of a 3X3 Matrix of pixels so the new pixel color is going to be an average 1 nth of this color plus 1 nth of this color plus 1 nth of this color plus one nth of this color so I take all of the colors and multiply them by 1 nth add them all together and I have the new color but we have a different um convolution here and it's described in in the diffusion uh in the reaction diffusion algorithm so this is the basic idea I need a twodimensional array each spot is going to have a certain amount of a and a certain amount of B I need to have a formula that for each cycle each frame through draw I get a new value of a and a new value of B and then a new value of a and a new value of B and the math formula is going to be something like this but more complicated because it's also going to involve all the neighbors so let's start setting this up now hopefully this is the basic idea let's start setting it up to program it okay so now I'm back over here uh I am back over here ah oh was I not over there the whole time I think I was over there the whole time hopefully this was right uh somebody in the chat tell me was I in the on the Whiteboard while was showing that um okay so if I go back to I have this blank uh code here um and uh I'm going to go to my uh canvas here and this is my canvas so the first thing I need to do is create okay I was good the first thing I need to do is create my uh twodimensional array to store all the amount the the amount of chemicals in each spot in the in the grid okay so twodimensional arrays in JavaScript are kind of a funny thing uh not funny haha funny a little bit weird because um arrays in JavaScript there's just so many different ways you can make them but ultimately what a twodimensional array is and let me kind of describe this to you briefly I'm going to make an array called grid and you could imagine like what if I did this um I'm gonna write something like this I'm just gonna kind of type something out for a second just to explain this this my friends you are my friends indeed is a twodimensional array I I kind of space it out like a grid but really what it is is just an array of arrays to see how it's an array open square bracket and square bracket and then it's three arrays inside of it but I could but so really a twodimensional array in programming is just an array of arrays so what I need is one array to keep an array for here for here for here for here right so I need the first array to be the first row the second array to be the second row the third array to be the third row that sort of thing but I I'm not going to type it out manually for 3x3 I could type it out manually what I need to do is kind of um is actually make it um uh make it in code okay everything's gonna be fine so I'm gonna create that variable and I'm gonna do it I'm gonna use a particular style I'm gonna do it different I'm gonna do it a different so what I'm going to do is I'm first just going to say grid is an array it's an empty array and what I need to do is I need to Loop xal 0 x is less than the width of this canvas and let me Zoom back out x++ so for every X and for every y right for every X ah stop oh I can't ah I'm waiting for my auto format that's not here um for every x what I need to do is say grid index X is an array so I start with this array and then I say hey let's make an array and then what am I going to put here grid XY equals now what do I what do I need in each spot in the grid now if I were just if I only had a single chemical if I only had a single chemical I was just putting a single number in each one of these but I have two chemicals I have an A and A B so let's actually I think this is a place where I could just make a literal JavaScript object and say a is you know there's zero of a and there is a zero of B so uh and you know I I don't think I need to be so long winded about it this is such a simple object I'm going to do this so I make each spot in the grid each spot in the grid for every X and every y there's an A and A B with zero of each chemical and I'm going to need to change that eventually but we're going to start there so this is good I now have my grid yay now here's the thing in order to make this work right the whole this whole is all all built on this idea of I need to get the Next Generation amount of a so I can't be me if this grid is the snapshot of all the chemicals in a current generation I need a completely separate grid to start filling in the new values because if I were to use the same grid if I start overwriting the values in that grid while I'm checking other values neighbors everything's going to get all messed up so what I should do is I'm also going to create a variable here called Next and I'm going to be kind of silly about it and I'm just going to make two of these and I'm going to say next so I now have two twodimensional arrays and I think I just want to briefly mention that um I could have done this so grid is going to be the current and then next is going to be the next one so I could have done this by also using new array in JavaScript to create a sort of fixed size but I know my array should have a width and height as kind of the number of uh columns and rows okay so now we're in good shape so what I can do what I want to do is just sort of see that the basic idea of this is working so what I need to do is draw a color a pixel color in the window based on each value in that grid so by the way we're going to need this double double nested Loop like a zillion times so I'm going to just copy paste that down here and one one thing I'm going to do at the very end is I'm going to say load pixels and then I'm going to uh say update pixels and what I'm going to do is I'm going to uh create a color let's just make sure I'm going to just make a nice you know pinkish purplish color just to make sure this is working and I'm going to say pixel index oh boy so guess what everybody I have a whole video that goes through the pixel array I should link to that from here the pixel array in Java in p5js in the JavaScript canvas is a pixel array that has four spots for every pixel so I need to figure out and it's onedimensional so I go through the derivation of this formula but I'm going to say pixal x + y times uh width Time 4 and then I'm going to say pixels pix plus 0 equals uh 255 and I'm going to this I don't need and I'm going to say zero and I'm GNA say 100 and then and this is uh one one two and three so what I've done here is I'm using a formula to find the right spot in that array for every single Pixel every width every column in every row and then I'm saying make its red 255 make its green zero make its blue 100 make its Alpha 2 55 so I just want to see that this runs okay great so I filled it with a color so I do have a way of setting every pixel color now what I want is for these colors to be based on the grid so I'm going to say grid X comma y. a and I'm going to say grid XY dob so um so I'm going to do the red and the blue as coming from the twodimensional array itself and we should see all black but if I give everything a uh random amount we should see uh okay so what am I missing here so I gave the grid a random amount of a and a random amount of B and uh what's missing oh I I did a random between zero and one so I what I want to do is multiply these by 255 there's there's lots of ways I could use color mode or get around this but I'm just going to multiply that by 255 oh and I'm gonna have to say floor because it has to be an integer I bet uh okay so I probably could have done a better job at this but there we go so you can see that this is working I have a mechanism by which based on the amount of chemicals I get a pixel color this is the core thing that we need so now all we need to do is say like okay let's put this formula in great so let's unpack this formula right because right now and and actually before we even do that let's let's actually just get the structure going so before I put the formula in let's do something let's put this nested Loop in again and what I want to say is now I need to use this next right next index XY equals and let me just do something like I'm going to make up a formula this isn't the actual reaction diffusion formula but what I'm going to do is where's the camera where's the screen I'm losing my mind I'm going to say grid X comma so next. a equals grid xy. a you know times 0.2 and next the the next B is the grids B * 1.2 so I'm going to do that so this is this again this isn't the correct formula we're going to have to actually put in the reaction diffusion formula but I'm showing this this is the structure by which I say the next generation will be that so now if I run this again we come back to here well it doesn't seem to be animating or changing why so it's not animating or changing because I'm still drawing it based on grid so maybe what I actually want to do is draw the next one and I did get something strange happening here so it looks different and let's actually um not let it go o the values go over me so you can see that it is actually doing something like the values are different but importantly here I don't see anything animating so one of the major things that we need here is and let's think about is something called a swap are you with me are you still paying attention I would understand if you weren't okay so I need a swap so this is a very common technique in seller automata systems and other types of Generation by generation systems what I have here is I have oops wrong side of this marker what I have here is I have a twodimensional array called grid and then I have one called next so grid is all my starting values then next is calculated and then next is drawn to the window well what should next should then become grid again so I can get a new next and draw that to the window so what I need to do is swap them what I need to do is say let me put next back into grid and then I have a new blank one to write on and I could just pull grid over there because it's the old one I don't need it anymore so if I if I want to have this continuous generation I have the old and the new so new gets calculated then new becomes old and I could just use that old one that I had to be the next new one and then new becomes old then then new gets calculated then new becomes old again so I need to have a swap so I'm actually going to write this as a separate function so at the end of every oops after I draw I'm going to call a function called Swap and I'm going to write that down can you see this I'm going to write this down oh somewhere down here so I'm going to write a function and called Swap and so what's going on here next I want grid to be next and I want next to be grid I want grid to be next and I want next to be grid I want to swap them oh but this is no good if grid is next and then next equals grid well then next is next because grid is next we've got a problem here so in a swap what I need to do is I need to have a temporary variable that keeps track of the old grid so now grid can become next and next can become that old grid temp so this is a very simple swapping algorithm to swap the values of two variables um and that'll do the trick for me so now if I swap them this will get applied over and over again so let's let's do 0. n and 08 just so we see something happening here and you can see it it went down to zero very quickly um and I could um you know I could say 0.95 and I could try doing 1.01 so you can see it's going towards it's going to go towards blue eventually so we can see we have the system going now again this isn't this is the like shiffman rainbow reaction diffusion algorithm which isn't very interesting at all so we have the guts here we have the foundation we have the twodimensional array each spot holds the amount of each chemical the screen is colored based on those chemicals and I have some formula to calculate the new chemical value based on the old chemical value so I don't know how long I've been doing this for but we're so close now all I need to do is actually go and get that scary formula uh from that web page and stick it in the code and we're done so let's go take a look at that this is going to be a bit more difficult than I might have imagined but let's see how it let's see how it goes so now we're back to here so let's look at all of these things okay a the of the new a equals what a so let's start putting this in uh so this we can do difference of a equals new a so I'm going to go back and um I'm G to probably need a lot more space here so um and I'm just going to do a for a second the new a right equals what the old a now I'm going to go back to this formula plus plus now what da what is da oh I can't operate the computer sometimes I went back by accident da is a diffusion rate so where are those here we go these are some typical values so this is by the way is something that you're going to after you watch this video and use this example you're going to want to like play around with these values yourself or go look up other values the different values will produce different kind of results so diffusion rate of a is one so I'm going to in my code I'm going to make these uh Global variables da equals 1 let's see what else we got uh DB equals 0.5 diffusion rate for B the feed feed is how fast are you feeding in chemical a is 0.55 I'm going to call that feed just to because F can mean other stuff in programming 0.055 was that it yep and K is 0.062 uh our k equals 0.062 that's that's sort of the the the kill rate how how fast is a b being removed um so these are the values that I'm going to need in that particular formula so now I can go back here and say uh plus the diffusion rate of a times La PL upside down triangle PL 2D function okay so let's let's make that something temporarily that we're going to deal with in a little bit so I'm just going to say right now I'm going to say la plus I'm going to make that a function La PL a we're going to deal with that later and uh times a times and you know what I should do to make this shorter I think something that can make things a little easier is I can say a equals grid XY a so that way I don't have to every time I need that a value I can just put a time a times uh uh oh no minus minus what a * b^ 2 uh so a * B * B and I'm going to I need a variable for a boy this is a lot of typing here guess you could fast forward now or put this on two times speed if you're watching this still uh I kind of want to like put this on multiple lines also just so you can see it so uh whoops no this should be here I'm going to do each piece of this formula on a different line uh I don't know if this is making it uh um a minus a * B * so we have a * the diffusion of a plus this lla thing I have to get to time a minus a * B * B and then now we have plus the feed multiplied by 1us a so plus the feed multiplied by 1 minus a did I get that right plus the feed multipli by 1 minus a and I'm going to put parentheses around these things I think I'm sure it's right anyway but this I think will help us a plus d a that doesn't seem right A Plus da times llas so I I so I'm gonna um just to be consistent here I'm G to move this down here and uh I think I now have all the components of that formula a plus da time LL time a minus a * B * B plus feed * 1 A does that look right somebody watching this in the live stream will correct me I think I've gotten this right um and we will uh yeah da lass time a okay so hopefully I got this right I have to do the same thing for B why not just do it right now that we're here so B is B plus uh the the diffusion rate for B and I'm going to make a lass B function which is a little bit silly what I'm doing here but I'm going to do it anyway um uh times B and then it is plus ab^ 2 plus ab^ 2 minus uh minus k + f * B K plus feed times B okay we're in good shape here I put parentheses around this just to be consistent so I think I now have um so I think I now have these formas now I I did miss a crucial point if you come back to this you'll see delta T delta T is the change in time for each iteration what does that mean well the way the world works is that Time Marches forward on and on and on the way that computer programs and animation programs work is Time Marches forward in time steps lock step and how and we're doing this calculation in this sort of like stop calculate Weight stop calculate Weight stop calculate so we can sort of scale the amount of time that's passing scale the calculation according to I'm going to leave that as one and basically my time scale is going to be the 60 frames per second that I hope that the um that the uh algorithm uh that I hope that the animation plays out at but you can really sort of change the quality of what you're getting and the degree of accuracy that you're getting by having a smaller time step so you might try 0.1 015 and see what you get but I'm going to kind of just leave that out for right now for the for the case of Simplicity Okay so we've done everything now except for this leian thing and so I'm realizing by the way that this is leian a this is not multiply by a this is the lassan a thing so one thing I can do is get rid of this times a and this times B um so what is that this is the convolution so this is this particular thing what I need to do in the lass function is look at the every single amount of a in all of the neighbors I need to multiply a weight and then add them all together to get the new value that's the Lan function the convolution so if we go back here let's go back to this page and here it says um the leian is performed with a three now there's different ways you could do this but this says with a 3 by3 convolution with a center weight of negative1 adjacent neighbors 2 and and diagonals .5 this means the following so I need to in this function look at every single cell and apply a weight 0.52 052 Point uh this is the center one negative 1 and then 2 05 2 05 the diagonals get a weight of 05 the adjacents get a weight of 0 2 and the center gets a weight of negative 1 we're trying to determine the difference between that Center cell and its neighbors and you notice it's in a way these have higher weights because it's like the adjacent ones are closer to it than the diagonals so those chemicals are going to play a larger role in the reaction you could try messing around with different values now there are all sorts of fancy ways I could write another nested Loop and kind of use some sort of other twodimensional array to keep track of the weights I probably should do that but I'm going to be a little bit lazy right now and just do this in a very hardcoded manual way so let's look at how I might do that um so if I come back here first of all let's just write um so down here I'm going to need a function called llas a and I'm also going to need a function called llas B and I'm just going to do something right now I'm going to just say they return the value one which is obviously like wildly incor oh boy I'm not here uh so I need to add these two functions sorry I lost I didn't get back here I need to add these two functions and I'm just for right now for Simplicity to make sure my code runs just say that they return the number one so that this should do something and I should get something um and I should get something so let's run this and you can see okay so something's working and you can almost even like see it oops see it like Flicker and do something weird and interesting for a second so that's good the other thing I want to change by the way and I'll deal with this later though let's leave that now okay so but now I need to actually do the correct llas function so what I think I'll do is pass into llas the function the current X and Y and then I'm going to do the entire calculation in that function and I need to do it with the grid right so what I need to do is say something like the sum for a is zero and then what I need to do is say sum a plus equal okay what's the center the center is grid XY times that weight1 so I need to do this like nine times for all nine neighbors 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 nine so the adjacent ones are all multiplied by 0 2 so adjacent to the left is x minus one adjacent to the right is+ one so these get multiplied by 02 then uh above and below is y + 1 and Yus one those get multiplied by 0.2 0.2 now I need to do all the diagonals again this is like a kind of terrible manual way of doing it but it's and I could do this in a loop and a much nicer way but I think this is good for figuring it out uh minus1 minus one 0.05 that's up and to the left + one minus one and I just need the same value for each one of these uh uh okay then I need uh I need plus one plus one and then minus one minus one does that seem right to you did I get oh no no no no I already did minus one minus one + one so I have oh boy I've been doing this for a half an hour that's that's not good um okay look this is turning out to be a very long video I should have done it in multiple Parts but it's too late now okay so uh minus oneus minus minus plus minus plus plus minus plus that's all four so I think I've gotten this right and then I just need to return and I need to get those X Y values as arguments and then I need to return that sum a uh and then oh and I'm not returning that whole object I'm not adding that I'm adding the a amount for each one of these and you know so I could do this in a more clever way by also having a B1 function to add these objects together so now I'm just going to do the and I could even like do a function that knows whether it's doing lla for a or b but again I'm just going to do this completely the totally manual way and we can do another video I'm going to I can make this just a few lines of code and I'm just going to be sitting here here ah come on Sublime it's try it's trying to be way too smart for me I just want to I don't want you to give me suggestions sometimes I want suggestions sometimes I don't want suggestions and this is silly now that I called it this but I did so I'm going to go I'm going to go all the way through with it okay so now we should we've got these llao functions I'm doing the convolution for every X and Y I'm adding up all the neighbors and the weights so that should go right into this formula and honestly I think we might be done I'm going be shocked if this actually works we're going to have to debug what we missed but let's run it I I I know this kind of okay so sketch ah great I love what just happened here so what just happened here cannot read property zero of undefined so I have I I could kind of try to figure out what's going on let's look at sketch. JS line 65 um so down here there's an issue here's the issue x one when is x one going to be a completely in valid spot in the Grid it's a completely invalid spot if x is zero because there's no negative one so I could do some sort of wraparound thing or whatever but I think what would be easiest here would just be to say hey you know what for this calculation I'm not going to do the edge pixels I'm going to start at one and I'm going to go to width minus one and height minus one so I'm actually going to ignore the edge pixel so I don't have that issue so that should fix that now I'm going to run it and look at this something kind of crazy happened so I think I've got the algorithm going here I I'm a little worried to have a mistake but the most mostly the problem right now is that I haven't really seated this this in a way that makes sense so I think the traditional way these are done let's look here is right I'm giving the grid all random values is what I think would make sense would be to fill it with B right I want to fill the grid with B let's run this it's blue and it uh or it kind of turned red that's interesting that's not what I expected to happen but I'm going to just leave that that and then what I want to do is I want to give one spot like I'm going to say I'm going to override that I'm going to say like uh 100 100 a actually has a bot out of a in it so I fill the grid with b and no a and then I give one spot I I pour in a little a in that one spot why am I getting this that's so interesting that I'm getting this weird Square thing so I must have messed something up this is probably where this video is going to like pause and there's going to be an edit point when it gets posted later CU now I have to figure out what did I do wrong I probably got something wrong in this formula so I'm going to have to examine this formula I also fortunately have that working processing example so I can compare it but let's try to debug I clearly did something wrong so one thing I want to do by the way is I'm going to just look at the way that I colored it in that old processing example um so I had this processing example that I showed you at the beginning and uh um the way that I did the color is I took the difference between a and b I just made a gray scale and multiplied that by 255 so let's actually just do that um and I'm gonna also going to do VAR a equals next x y * a uh VAR b equals next XY dob and then I'm going to do the color is what did I say a minus B * 255 oh oh I know it a minus B * 255 uh and let's floor that uh and I probably also need to let's leave that and so let's let's make that the grayscale value for each of these spots I I I think I know some things that are wrong um so I'm going to make I'm just going to do Grays scale right now I was trying to be fancy by having different colors for a and b and that'll be kind of simple I also want to say this C equals constrain between 0 and 255 um so I want to keep that constrained let's run this now and see what we get I'm interesting that I'm getting this like weird square like I must have a mistake in the formula I'm going to keep going here but one thing I also think that I should do is that I believe that I um is just to be safe after I do this I also want to constrain um I also want to constrain that new value uh between zero and one I'm just going to be like really over I'm going to overdo it in terms of the constraints here so that the my ranges stay reasonable let's see if that does anything different interesting did I uh what did I miss here constrain next between zero and one that seems reasonable right I'm getting these new a values uh I gave this an A so I'm going to take a look at these formulas here and let's double check them and see where I might have gotten it wrong a oh let me look at it over here A plus the diffusion rate times the laass of a hopefully I did that right minus a * b^ 2 plus feed * 1 A that seems good b equals B plus the diffusion rate of B plus times llas does have to be um XY plus a * b ^ 2 minus k + Fe * B so those formulas look right let me look in my processing sketch and see um uh let's see um what's going on here A plus this times l a A plus feed 1 minus a so these look right um now I bet you I messed something up in the lass function so I'm just looking I'm just scanning these here to see if this looks the same spot new spot um yeah grid next previous I used previous and grid which is a little I uh tricky and I did did a constrain as well everything looks the same right anybody see anything is brackets messing with the order of operations it's a good question so let's look at this let's look Also let's look at like my L Bloss function uh X grid minus 2.2 y + 2.2 and adding all those up then I do minus minus plusus plus plusus plus that looks right did I get it right with B also how did I and then let's see how I initially so these I expect to be right as well minus one minus one how did I the formulas looked right uh I don't I don't know if any parentheses or off I don't think they are um this is right then I get the next next and I'm looking at grid right not in next here and then I swap I'm drawing grid okay so let's now the other thing is I um let's look at how I seated it so in processing in the beginning I oh I started with all a and no B well let's try that and then here I give a little bit of B maybe that's what I just needed to do because uh that's and now I can go back here uh come back and let's see what happens who craziness that was kind of interesting now time scale wi now let's let me check these numbers let me make sure those numbers are right this is what I had here in processing those look the same right uh uh yeah okay everything looks identical let's be like so what I actually did here was I gave it object should be the same wow it really looks identical um I'm sure there's something I'm missing here the way I'm doing the color pixels pixels update pixels swap swap my swap is Right Temp is grid then grid is the next one and then next is temp that should work these are right this is me adding everything together these formulas seem right AB a Ab XY uh ab ab xyxy oh oh no that's right 100 100 B that's right should be fine with just one spot right because one thing I can do here just to like simulate it oh no that shouldn't matter though this shouldn't M oh I wonder because of the swap do that do I need to like that shouldn't matter though so I'm not you yeah that doesn't matter um let's let me just out of curiosity make these identical now um and uh that should be the same now 200 200 just making sure this one works Works whoops oh oh is that not enough maybe that's the problem uh hold on all right that's interesting can I not just start with one spot what did I this was working right did I mess something up here put this back oh wait no no run this again okay hold on a sec everybody let's take the algorithm I used here to seed the system over here maybe just one SP oh whoops oh no that should be fine because a is already okay hold on let's do this though so n times I'm G to pick a random starting spot and then oh I realized oh my goodness okay I realized what the problem is I know what the problem is to go back this was a nice idea okay I I don't know if this is going to fix it I should probably go all the way through with this but I know what the problem is so hello I'm back I don't know where I that's going to get edited somehow um so here's the issue I just I I wanted to add like a little bit of B like I filled the whole thing with a I actually switched that from when I was maybe last in this video so I filled the whole thing with a and then I want to add a little bit of B but that's not going to work just like a one little droplet of be on one pixel not going to get enough reaction diffusion to make anything happen I actually need to give it a block a block of like I need to pour a lot more in so I need like a little area of so what I think I'm going to do is I'm I'm going to say uh for I'm going to use I here just to use a different like I equal 100 I is less than 10 I ++ no I is less than 110 i++ now how you seed the system is like super interesting and I'm doing this not in a very interesting way but I'm going to use J uh j++ and what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a whole area and give it some B like a little 10 by1 pixel area so every pixel from between 100 to 110 is going to get some B right every pixel is going to start with a lot of a and no B and then this little 10 by10 area is going to start with a and what I'm actually going to do is just for a second comment this out so let's just see what this looks like now why am I I'm getting this crazy flickering you can't see that actually interestingly enough I don't think the flickering is showing up because I've done something wrong with my rendering but you can see though that whoa oh now you're seeing interest I don't know what you're actually seeing on the stream um oh boy this is a really this was a much harder one than I imagined but I'm going to put this back in I got to figure out what the flickering is there why the flickering is happening okay so you can see this is now finally working um I'm getting a weird flickering around the edges oh oh I know what the problem is I know what the problem is because I'm not updating the edges the edges need to make sure they're seated with the original amount of stuff there we go finally we're good so it took me a little while there but the issue was that I needed to place an area of of pixels um in order to to to seat it with some chemical B so uh this was this was much this would have been good this would have benefited from this will benefit from a second run like I could just do this whole thing again and probably get through it a lot faster with less hiccups but hopefully this helped you can see now I now have the reaction diffusion simulation you can see this is one little area of pixels um and you know what happens if you give it like like a circular area of pixels or start stuff with like random values what kind of patterns might you get and you can see the reaction diffusion algorithm is kind of blossoming into this nice little flower we can let it run for a little bit I'm curious about the frame rate I I'm it's JavaScript is handling this pretty well this is only 200x 200 pixels um so it isn't um it is isn't a tremendous amount of pixels for it to work with but so you might run into some serious performance issues if you do this in the browser it's going to run a lot faster in processing of course I'm sure there's like fancy Shader web gel ways of doing this super super fast but um I think this kind of wraps up this tutorial so to recap just now that we've kind of like just want to use this last few minutes to kind of recap what I've got is uh here we started out with uh in the code which to walk through all the pieces of the code now there is the grid which stores the amount of A and B chemicals across every pixel there are all these constants which are associated with the gray Scott inter implementation so there's a an amount of diffusion for a an amount of diffusion for B there's a feed rate and a kill rate so you can look up different values for those like known values that produce different patterns you can also just play with those yourself then I have to create these two dimensional arrays I need a current and a next because I got to calculate the Next Generation and then use the current as the Next Generation then use it as the next I've got this cycling going on and I'm starting filling it each spot with all chemical a and no B then I start a little area of pixels a 10 x10 area of pixels to put some chemical B in and this is another place where you wanting to play with this code you should try something different like what if you fill in around the Contours of a silhouette and you start getting this like silhouetted person reaction diffusion pattern then in draw I do a bunch of things number number one is I just actually Implement that reaction diffusion formula I need to calculate the next amount of A and B based on the current amount of a the diffusion rate the feed the kill rate all of that stuff as well as this sum of all of the neighbors so the sum of all the neighbors happens in these llas functions and that is lower down in the code again I would suggest and I'd be happy to do this and post this at some point if someone wants to remind me modified version I could condense this into one function and I could also make this happen in a loop but I think this really shows exactly what's happening and these weights again are defined by The Sims uh page you could use you could weight things or you could have a 5x5 Matrix you could do different things there so that's calculating all those next values and then here the only thing that's happening here is I'm Now setting every single Pixel in the window a color based on the amount of a and the amount of B and I'm just using black and white so it's up to you I think I could go back you could say well the amount of a could be the amount of blue the amount of B could be amount of the green you could you could create Rainbow cycling color somebody make a rainbow reaction diffusion thing um there's a lot of possibilities there for how you can play with this but this is all of the code I think this is probably a 40 to 45 minute video I'm assuming at this point um and so uh please play with this uh send me your feedback send me your comments and um let me know how it goes thanks for watching okay live stream Watchers I I I'm guessing I've got like 50 people watching now let's see uh let's see I oh 95 people are still I guess people um okay so the I can't believe that I've done this live stream now for 2 hours and 40 minutes I did take a couple breaks um I think this really uh um draws to a close here I'm quite pleased with this result I think this worked out well you can see it's sort of asymmetrical because my pixels weren't picked actually in the center of this so you you might sort of see what happens you get this I I completely I'm completely brain dead right now I need to go drop by ITP and eat some lunch and check my email on my phone make sure there's no important messages um so oh yeah so people are asking I might as well just try it right now just for fun real quick um let's just see if I right here go back and say uh a * 255 and B um B * 255 and I'm GNA add floor so I can quickly just to see what happens if I add the colors in uh and I think that should do it so you can see I've got what should hopefully be a nice combination of Blues and reds and pinks and purples as so it's very slow going and I probably could do something to calculate it more quickly behind the scenes and somebody suggested using web workers there's all sorts of possibilities here but you can kind of enjoy this and play with colors in different ways okay I'm GNA um stick around here for a minute or two to see if there's any questions I'm I'm going to return this week on Thursday our Friday I'm going to try to set up a patreon this week so um please help me uh spread the word about that if you're enjoying this stuff and you feel so inclined um oh this will definitely get archived for YouTube I think I'll probably cut out about 5 to 10 minutes of the debugging uh and when I say I have I've one of the reasons why I want to start the patreon is I've hired a a wonderful person um who lives in Canada who's been helping me maintain the descriptions and the tags and edit some videos so if you have suggestions for how things could be organized better for how things could be edited for how things could be tagged to improve search uh please let me know um and so this this whole stream will be Arch as soon as I hit stop this whole thing will be archived all 2 hours and 40 minutes will be archived on YouTube but I think I don't know I might take like the jumping thing as like its own Standalone video not so sure about that some of the question answer stuff might get archive too um um so I'm going to kind of scroll back uh I'm just going to see if anybody has any questions uh make it faster that's something to do why you used VAR over let uh VAR is just sort of like um this JavaScript style that I'm using it's what I'm used to I didn't know that you could use let in JavaScript maybe you can um JavaScript is so flexible um that was that was one question I'm curious I'm not while I'm here I'm just going to look at twitch for a second seven people are watching um uh oh oh let me mention a couple things while I'm here because I I want some uh feedback about this oh I think I'm off Facebook Facebook wow Facebook couldn't maintain it uh oh it says it's also said it's end that's interesting I wonder if Facebook was like you can't stream for 2 hours and 45 minutes you crazy person um so one thing I want to talk about is that um I so I um I have two kids and they like to they both like to play Minecraft or the the the four almost 5yearold is a little too young for it my sevenyearold is is really kind of obsessed with it and I was I've been researching and trying Minecraft modding for a while and it I kind of was like excited about that I was going to make a processing addon for it but I Goan l over the weekend suggested something called computercraft to me which is a Minecraft mod which allows you to um this is not the page I'm looking for I was kind of looking for the wiki um here this is a nice page it allows you to create these uh blocks in Minecraft if you're not familiar with Minecraft you just shut this off right now or um which allows you to write Lua code into it and so I was thinking of doing some interesting tutorials of try and it let you create these like turtle blocks which allow you to like build structures in Minecraft and I was thinking taking nature of code algorithms and programming these Turtle blocks to do like L systems or different like fractal or maze patterns in Minecraft and honestly one I was thinking of doing this because it kind of interests me the other reason I was thinking of doing this honestly was because you know you look at YouTube and you see some of these uh Minecraft videos have you know millions of views and millions of subscribers so there's an interest level for that could I combine programming education Minecraft you know I realized Minecraft is commercial software I try to use like open platforms but um so I'm thinking of doing that my concern is is that too much of a distraction from this kind of core audience that I have of people interested in JavaScript and processing and creative coding so I uh I'm curious for your feedback um I don't know whether that should be a separate Channel or the same channel or I shouldn't do that or I should do that but if you have suggestions or thoughts about that I don't have a good way of Twitter would be a way to communicate with me or write in the YouTube comments I guess on this particular uh on the archive of this video um but uh am I still streaming on YouTube by the way because Facebook said it ended yeah I see myself there so uh I might look in the chat to see for a second but um ultimately what I'm thinking of doing with this patreon is creating a a private slack for uh people who subscribe to the patreon so and that will be a place for discussion and question answering and I'll still answer questions on the YouTube comments and the Kaden forum and the processing Forum um and I and I don't ever have an intention of making videos that aren't always open and available but I do um you know I do think I need to look into some uh uh Revenue different Revenue economic experiments for this stuff as I'd like to buy some new equipment and pay people and pay myself U Beyond just you know this is anyway so that's kind of a discussion I reference it almost every time I do a live stream and it just honestly like it's to me I'm like oh I could spend the day setting up the patreon or I could just do another live stream and I usually just choose to do the live stream but we'll see what happens next time um so uh ah so people are talking about uh uh they'd like to see genetic algorithm stuff actually one thing I'd really like to do is see if Caden would let me license the videos and include them in my YouTube stream because I just I did all these genetic algorithm videos with the Caden course you could go to their site and watch them and open I can think of a million I can think of several reasons why they wouldn't want me to do that but um I sort of I feel like am I really going to redo all these genetic algorithms tutorials when I did it for the Caden course so I'll think about that you know um but I do those haven't come out yet so when those come out they'll be available there um I'd be very interested to see if anyone tries this s of reaction diffusion stuff in 3D it would all kind of work the same way um can you point me in the right direction to turn these sketches into interactive screen savers um so if you want to use um a a pro you can use processing you can make a application it really depends a processing you can make a Java application out of it if you can turn a Java application into a screen saver then you're done uh with JavaScript you need something that will wrap a web page into a screen saver and there's stuff like that for window windows and for Mac um OS um uh the 3D would be the same idea with 26 neighboring cells yes that's right uh what you're doing is quite interesting I'm jumping into python is there a similar starting point compared to your book um actually um I don't know this isn't necessarily the the best python starting point as like learning the language Python and what python is generally used for and and but if you're interested in kind of creative coding and processing python then um Allison parish is working on a version of Casey Reese and Ben Fri getting started uh with processing do I I believe I can't remember if it's out yet or not so I'm going to Google it and find it on Amazon um and um there it is does this look out preorder so you have to preorder this but this would be a starting point by the way I'm just like now I'm just uh if you're ever interested in ordering stuff on Amazon and you want to throw a few dollars my way if you just go here to like natureof code.com and click on Amazon even if you don't buy nature of code you you move around and buy other stuff it's going to do an associate uh fee to me better yet though I just want to give a plug to Amazon smile processing foundation so you can actually have all of your purchases uh support processing with amazon. smile so Amazon donates processing is a registered
