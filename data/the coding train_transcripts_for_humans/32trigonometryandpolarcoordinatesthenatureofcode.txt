00:02 - trigonometry this video is about
00:04 - trigonometry I hope you're excited about
00:06 - that okay we said before what what
00:09 - trigonometry is it is the study of the
00:11 - relationships between the angles and
00:14 - sides of a right triangle now if you
00:16 - ever took some type of geometry class or
00:18 - some sort of maybe in high school you
00:20 - learned about trigonometry you might
00:21 - have learned this very odd and strange
00:23 - pneumonic
00:25 - device
00:28 - so TOA now I'm not sure how much that
00:31 - really helps you because it's kind of
00:33 - hard to remember just that but if you
00:34 - can remember soaa then you can remember
00:37 - s cosine and tangent so what I want to
00:40 - First do in um in this video is review
00:43 - what s means what cosine means what
00:46 - tangent means and we're going to see how
00:48 - those can be applied in some scenarios
00:50 - particularly when we want to draw
00:52 - something on the screen in terms of
00:54 - something called polar coordinates we're
00:55 - going to look at this thing called polar
00:57 - coordinates we we always draw things in
00:59 - cartisian coordinates there's this XY
01:01 - location there's this width there's this
01:03 - height we're going to think about polar
01:04 - coordinates so soaa what does that mean
01:07 - well let's say we have a right
01:10 - triangle that means a triangle with an
01:12 - angle that's
01:14 - 90° a right angle right over here Pi / 2
01:18 - and there is some angle here now often
01:21 - angles are written in sort of the world
01:24 - of notation as the Greek letter Theta so
01:26 - you might even see in some code examples
01:28 - float Theta equals or you could always
01:30 - say float angle equals obviously you can
01:32 - name variables whatever you want but
01:34 - Theta is a common symbol or term for an
01:38 - angle okay so we have this angle Theta
01:41 - and this side of the triangle this is
01:44 - the
01:45 - opposite side because is opposite from
01:47 - the angle this is the adjacent side it
01:51 - is adjacent to the angle and this is the
01:55 - hypot
01:57 - hypotenuse okay so here's our right
01:59 - triangle angle angle adjacent opposite
02:01 - hypotenuse okay what is s s is opposite
02:05 - divided hypotenuse so s of theta is
02:10 - opposite divid hypotenuse what is cosine
02:14 - adjacent divided by hypotenuse cosine of
02:17 - the is adjacent divided hypotenuse and
02:21 - tangent of theta is opposite divided
02:27 - adjacent so these form
02:31 - formulas come up again and again in many
02:34 - different scenarios one scenario in
02:36 - particular that we're going to look at
02:37 - not in this video is a swinging pendulum
02:40 - if you think this is a pendulum this is
02:42 - the force of gravity on the pendulum
02:44 - pointing down but this is the direction
02:48 - of that the pendulum is going to move
02:50 - you can see we've made a right triangle
02:52 - here we need the force of the pendulum
02:53 - which is a comp so we're gonna do lots
02:55 - of stuff there's GNA be lots of diagrams
02:58 - involved and things that we're going to
02:59 - make that suddenly have a right triangle
03:01 - in them and we have to say ah we know
03:03 - this side of the triangle but not this
03:04 - side oh and we know the angle or we know
03:06 - the sides and we don't know the angle
03:08 - right different scenarios we're going to
03:09 - know different things and if we know the
03:11 - sides we can get the angle if we know
03:13 - the angle we can get the sides etc etc
03:16 - so that's what's going to come up again
03:18 - and again one scenario that I want to
03:20 - look at in this video this hopefully
03:22 - less than 10-minute video is looking at
03:24 - polar coordinates polar coordinates is a
03:27 - place a an opportunity for us to use the
03:30 - um basics of trigonometry in a sketch
03:32 - okay so what do I mean by polar
03:36 - coordinates so let's say we have a a a
03:40 - cartisian coordinate space now I'm going
03:42 - to draw a traditional one not a a
03:45 - processing window but we'll map that in
03:47 - a moment to a code example with in a
03:48 - processing window so this is a
03:50 - two-dimensional uh cartisian space okay
03:54 - two dimensional space now we might have
03:57 - we have an x-axis we have a y- axis
04:00 - we could say
04:02 - hey this is the point uh 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3
04:08 - four I don't know right this is the
04:10 - point 5 comma 4 that's its cartisian
04:12 - coordinate it has an X of five a y of
04:15 - four so everything in this space we
04:18 - could think of in terms of what's its x
04:20 - value -3
04:22 - -45 four right of its X and Y a polar
04:26 - coordinate is a different way of
04:28 - thinking about a location in two
04:29 - dimension space instead of describing an
04:32 - X and A Y that is cartisian
04:36 - a polar coordinate describes an r and a
04:41 - Theta what do we mean by
04:44 - that an r and a Theta so you can get
04:49 - anywhere on the screen by saying hey go
04:52 - to this X and go to this y or you could
04:54 - say rotate by this angle and go to this
04:57 - radius right so this is a way of um
05:00 - thinking about uh locations on the
05:02 - screen now here's the problem when in
05:05 - processing if I go to say hey let's draw
05:08 - a circle somewhere I can't say R comma
05:10 - Theta right processings drawing
05:13 - functions Point vertex ellipse line wct
05:16 - they only accept cartisian
05:18 - coordinates so if we want to think
05:21 - sometimes we want to think in terms of
05:22 - polar coordinates right when would we
05:24 - want to think in terms of polar
05:25 - coordinates well what if we want our
05:26 - motion to move like this well that could
05:28 - just be Ching the angle instead of
05:30 - saying x++ like x++ moves this way angle
05:34 - Plus+ would rotate the object r++ or our
05:38 - angle rotating and like what if we want
05:40 - to do a spiral if the radius shrinks
05:42 - while we're rotating that's a spiral
05:45 - pattern so we could get spiral motion
05:47 - very easily by thinking in terms of
05:48 - polar
05:49 - coordinates but then how do we draw
05:52 - polar coordinates how do we set
05:53 - something at a polar coordinate well
05:55 - let's look at how we're going to do
05:58 - that
06:02 - let's
06:03 - say we know something is at a particular
06:10 - Theta with a particular R so this is my
06:14 - polar coordinate R comma
06:16 - Theta
06:18 - well this is the Y
06:21 - value and this is the x value Bo did I
06:23 - draw that
06:24 - terribly we can make a right triangle
06:27 - the cartisian coordinate is X comma y if
06:31 - we know R comma Theta how could we get X
06:34 - comma y well what is sine of theta in
06:37 - this instant s of theta is opposite over
06:40 - hypotenuse opposite is y hypotenuse is r
06:44 - y / R cosine of theta is adjacent which
06:49 - is x ided r x ided r okay now we're
06:54 - really this is super exciting okay
06:57 - what's Happening Here we could solve for
06:59 - x or y so easily right I don't know if
07:02 - you like doing stuff with equations but
07:03 - if you like doing stuff with equations
07:05 - you can see here just multiply each side
07:06 - of the equation by R right Y is actually
07:09 - equal to R * s of theta X is equal to R
07:15 - time cosine of theta right if I multiply
07:18 - this side of the equation by R the RS
07:20 - cancel each other out and I have y = r *
07:23 - sin Theta so this is a formula this
07:26 - formula right here this simple simple
07:28 - formula says if I know the r the the
07:32 - radius and angle of a polar coordinate I
07:34 - know the Y if I and since I know the
07:36 - radius and angle of a polar coordinate I
07:37 - know the X so we could think in terms of
07:39 - polar coordinates and draw in terms of
07:41 - cartisian coordinates and that opens up
07:43 - a lot of possibilities um so let's take
07:46 - a look at an actual example that does
07:48 - this over
07:50 - here okay hello again now we're over
07:52 - here um okay so let's just say we're
07:55 - going to have some Global variable
07:57 - called r r in this case let's say is is
07:59 - going to be 50 and we're going to have
08:01 - some angle I'm just going to call it a
08:03 - which is going to be
08:05 - zero stupid
08:07 - P okay now I'm going to make a I forgot
08:10 - to draw stuff here a black background
08:13 - and I'm going to translate just for to
08:15 - the center of the window because I think
08:16 - that'll be simplest and then I'm going
08:19 - to draw a
08:21 - circle I can't draw it at R comma Theta
08:24 - I'm going draw it at something called X
08:26 - comma y so now how how do I get X comma
08:30 - y I know R and angle I want X and Y
08:34 - remember formula right over
08:37 - there x = r * cosine of the angle y = r
08:44 - * s of the angle so now that we've done
08:49 - that I don't know make sure our circle
08:52 - is white uh what did I oh oh we need to
08:54 - declare these
08:57 - variables oh I'm not over here ah sorry
09:00 - I was typing for a little while sorry
09:02 - about that
09:04 - g uh this one's going to have to be
09:06 - fixed but I'm going to just keep going
09:07 - so um we have a little circle now you
09:09 - the radius is only 50 which isn't that
09:11 - far let's actually
09:13 - draw a
09:15 - line just so we can see that line also
09:20 - uh so we can see there is our let's make
09:24 - the radius a little bit
09:25 - bigger right there is our object at a
09:28 - polar ordinate the it's a radius of
09:31 - 150 and a angle of zero what if I change
09:35 - the angle
09:37 - to Pi ID
09:39 - 4 there we can see it's 40 45 degrees
09:44 - rotated and what if I do something like
09:46 - say hey let's
09:50 - apply angular
09:53 - velocity angular
09:58 - acceleration let's all those rules of
10:02 - angular
10:05 - uh
10:08 - oops all those
10:10 - rules that we used before we can apply
10:13 - here now we have this whoa it's like
10:15 - you're swinging something super exciting
10:16 - in the air um so okay so what have we
10:19 - got here look this looks strangely oddly
10:22 - like the just uh and and I'm going to um
10:25 - I'm going to use a constraint
10:28 - here to limit angular velocity between
10:31 - zero and just say one that's probably
10:34 - too big anyway but um so um what's
10:38 - interesting about this example is this
10:39 - looks remarkably familiar it looks kind
10:42 - of like the example we just did this is
10:44 - just we could use translate and rotate
10:45 - to create this exact same effect but
10:48 - here we chose let's actually we want to
10:49 - kind of be in charge of the XY positions
10:52 - of objects we don't want to just let
10:53 - translate and rotate in the
10:54 - Transformations do it for us we're using
10:56 - math polar to cartisian coordinate
10:58 - transformation
10:59 - different scenarios require different
11:01 - options it's a nice to be able to kind
11:03 - of do both of them and that was kind of
11:05 - an insane uh large um acceleration for
11:10 - me to constrain to okay so uh as an
11:13 - exercise what I would suggest for you to
11:15 - do is try to think of some type of
11:17 - pattern a spiral pattern is a good one
11:19 - but if you were to what happens if R
11:21 - changes by pear and noise what happens
11:23 - if the angle changes by pear and noise
11:25 - what if you shrink the angle grow the
11:27 - angle how could you create some type of
11:30 - motion path that is different from just
11:33 - like moving in A Perfect Circle what
11:35 - what what ways could you vary R and Vary
11:38 - the angle to create different kinds of
11:40 - motion that you couldn't do so easily
11:41 - with just um uh moving an object's
11:44 - position around okay so uh I think we're
11:47 - in good shape now that we understand
11:48 - trigonometry the next thing we're going
11:50 - to do in the next video is see how sign
11:53 - and cosine how the the properties of
11:55 - those functions um um Can map to
11:58 - oscillating motion to wave patterns okay
12:01 - great goodbye

Cleaned transcript:

trigonometry this video is about trigonometry I hope you're excited about that okay we said before what what trigonometry is it is the study of the relationships between the angles and sides of a right triangle now if you ever took some type of geometry class or some sort of maybe in high school you learned about trigonometry you might have learned this very odd and strange pneumonic device so TOA now I'm not sure how much that really helps you because it's kind of hard to remember just that but if you can remember soaa then you can remember s cosine and tangent so what I want to First do in um in this video is review what s means what cosine means what tangent means and we're going to see how those can be applied in some scenarios particularly when we want to draw something on the screen in terms of something called polar coordinates we're going to look at this thing called polar coordinates we we always draw things in cartisian coordinates there's this XY location there's this width there's this height we're going to think about polar coordinates so soaa what does that mean well let's say we have a right triangle that means a triangle with an angle that's 90° a right angle right over here Pi / 2 and there is some angle here now often angles are written in sort of the world of notation as the Greek letter Theta so you might even see in some code examples float Theta equals or you could always say float angle equals obviously you can name variables whatever you want but Theta is a common symbol or term for an angle okay so we have this angle Theta and this side of the triangle this is the opposite side because is opposite from the angle this is the adjacent side it is adjacent to the angle and this is the hypot hypotenuse okay so here's our right triangle angle angle adjacent opposite hypotenuse okay what is s s is opposite divided hypotenuse so s of theta is opposite divid hypotenuse what is cosine adjacent divided by hypotenuse cosine of the is adjacent divided hypotenuse and tangent of theta is opposite divided adjacent so these form formulas come up again and again in many different scenarios one scenario in particular that we're going to look at not in this video is a swinging pendulum if you think this is a pendulum this is the force of gravity on the pendulum pointing down but this is the direction of that the pendulum is going to move you can see we've made a right triangle here we need the force of the pendulum which is a comp so we're gonna do lots of stuff there's GNA be lots of diagrams involved and things that we're going to make that suddenly have a right triangle in them and we have to say ah we know this side of the triangle but not this side oh and we know the angle or we know the sides and we don't know the angle right different scenarios we're going to know different things and if we know the sides we can get the angle if we know the angle we can get the sides etc etc so that's what's going to come up again and again one scenario that I want to look at in this video this hopefully less than 10minute video is looking at polar coordinates polar coordinates is a place a an opportunity for us to use the um basics of trigonometry in a sketch okay so what do I mean by polar coordinates so let's say we have a a a cartisian coordinate space now I'm going to draw a traditional one not a a processing window but we'll map that in a moment to a code example with in a processing window so this is a twodimensional uh cartisian space okay two dimensional space now we might have we have an xaxis we have a y axis we could say hey this is the point uh 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 four I don't know right this is the point 5 comma 4 that's its cartisian coordinate it has an X of five a y of four so everything in this space we could think of in terms of what's its x value 3 45 four right of its X and Y a polar coordinate is a different way of thinking about a location in two dimension space instead of describing an X and A Y that is cartisian a polar coordinate describes an r and a Theta what do we mean by that an r and a Theta so you can get anywhere on the screen by saying hey go to this X and go to this y or you could say rotate by this angle and go to this radius right so this is a way of um thinking about uh locations on the screen now here's the problem when in processing if I go to say hey let's draw a circle somewhere I can't say R comma Theta right processings drawing functions Point vertex ellipse line wct they only accept cartisian coordinates so if we want to think sometimes we want to think in terms of polar coordinates right when would we want to think in terms of polar coordinates well what if we want our motion to move like this well that could just be Ching the angle instead of saying x++ like x++ moves this way angle Plus+ would rotate the object r++ or our angle rotating and like what if we want to do a spiral if the radius shrinks while we're rotating that's a spiral pattern so we could get spiral motion very easily by thinking in terms of polar coordinates but then how do we draw polar coordinates how do we set something at a polar coordinate well let's look at how we're going to do that let's say we know something is at a particular Theta with a particular R so this is my polar coordinate R comma Theta well this is the Y value and this is the x value Bo did I draw that terribly we can make a right triangle the cartisian coordinate is X comma y if we know R comma Theta how could we get X comma y well what is sine of theta in this instant s of theta is opposite over hypotenuse opposite is y hypotenuse is r y / R cosine of theta is adjacent which is x ided r x ided r okay now we're really this is super exciting okay what's Happening Here we could solve for x or y so easily right I don't know if you like doing stuff with equations but if you like doing stuff with equations you can see here just multiply each side of the equation by R right Y is actually equal to R * s of theta X is equal to R time cosine of theta right if I multiply this side of the equation by R the RS cancel each other out and I have y = r * sin Theta so this is a formula this formula right here this simple simple formula says if I know the r the the radius and angle of a polar coordinate I know the Y if I and since I know the radius and angle of a polar coordinate I know the X so we could think in terms of polar coordinates and draw in terms of cartisian coordinates and that opens up a lot of possibilities um so let's take a look at an actual example that does this over here okay hello again now we're over here um okay so let's just say we're going to have some Global variable called r r in this case let's say is is going to be 50 and we're going to have some angle I'm just going to call it a which is going to be zero stupid P okay now I'm going to make a I forgot to draw stuff here a black background and I'm going to translate just for to the center of the window because I think that'll be simplest and then I'm going to draw a circle I can't draw it at R comma Theta I'm going draw it at something called X comma y so now how how do I get X comma y I know R and angle I want X and Y remember formula right over there x = r * cosine of the angle y = r * s of the angle so now that we've done that I don't know make sure our circle is white uh what did I oh oh we need to declare these variables oh I'm not over here ah sorry I was typing for a little while sorry about that g uh this one's going to have to be fixed but I'm going to just keep going so um we have a little circle now you the radius is only 50 which isn't that far let's actually draw a line just so we can see that line also uh so we can see there is our let's make the radius a little bit bigger right there is our object at a polar ordinate the it's a radius of 150 and a angle of zero what if I change the angle to Pi ID 4 there we can see it's 40 45 degrees rotated and what if I do something like say hey let's apply angular velocity angular acceleration let's all those rules of angular uh oops all those rules that we used before we can apply here now we have this whoa it's like you're swinging something super exciting in the air um so okay so what have we got here look this looks strangely oddly like the just uh and and I'm going to um I'm going to use a constraint
