00:14 - primary stream we're not receiving video
00:21 - day not fast enough rate your viewers
00:25 - may experience buffering sure your
00:28 - connection is fast enough or consider
00:32 - lowering a bit rate can you hear me can
00:45 - you see me this big giant red word is on
00:51 - my live streaming page that says bad bad
00:56 - bad your bad oh good good good
01:00 - [Music]
01:06 - I'm here with you
01:09 - [Music]
01:25 - all right here we are welcome I would
01:31 - say that this is a special Monday coding
01:34 - train surprise visit but it's not really
01:39 - because I mentioned I was gonna be here
01:40 - on Monday and I actually to be honest
01:42 - with you I was planning to cancel the
01:43 - livestream today and then somehow
01:47 - overnight the channel hit 500,000
01:50 - subscribers which is a much larger
01:52 - number than I imagined could be possible
01:55 - with this nonsense that I'm doing until
02:00 - I thought I should do something to
02:02 - celebrate that I have I have some I have
02:09 - to say though however and I'm just
02:11 - opening up the chat over here that I see
02:14 - and I see the YouTube chat I have to say
02:17 - that I'm you're not gonna see me for a
02:20 - little while after today although I have
02:22 - a lot of content edited content that is
02:24 - yet to be released so there will be new
02:26 - videos coming out on the channel over
02:28 - the next two weeks but I am going out of
02:30 - town for a couple days then I am moving
02:33 - I have not moved in ten years when I'm
02:35 - moving from a apartment to another
02:37 - apartment so that's taking up a lot of
02:45 - my mental time and energy then I'm going
02:47 - away on another trip and I won't be back
02:50 - in New York until July 12th so after
02:53 - today I'm gonna be gone for like three
02:55 - weeks possibly if if if a miracle
03:00 - happens I'll be back next week for like
03:02 - one live stream next week so I am gonna
03:04 - be in town and have moved for a couple
03:06 - days but so I just wanted to put that
03:08 - out there
03:08 - I will I will say though ever that I am
03:11 - planning to go to the barber shop to
03:15 - deal with this because this this can't
03:19 - this can't be going any longer so
03:25 - now oh this is not on let's see if I can
03:29 - turn this camera on now this is what I
03:33 - had been doing previously last week I
03:37 - had been working on a example using
03:41 - tensorflow J s to make a classification
03:46 - project or I'm classifying RGB inputs
03:50 - that are RGB colors three inputs and
03:54 - returning one of nine possible labels
03:57 - that say something about the color like
04:00 - bluish reddish brownish etc and so I'm
04:03 - trying to show the whole machine
04:05 - learning process from collecting data
04:07 - cleaning data training a model and then
04:09 - predicting with new data and that model
04:12 - testing the model so I'm about maybe a
04:15 - third or half way through that and
04:17 - that's the thing that I probably should
04:20 - continue although but I'm gonna take a
04:22 - break from that I only have about an
04:23 - hour and I'm going to try to do
04:25 - something to celebrate 500,000
04:26 - subscribers but before I get to that I
04:28 - have one more thing to say which is that
04:30 - a project that I have been working on
04:32 - but that I really cannot kind of barely
04:35 - take any credit for whatsoever is this
04:39 - project called ml5 and so when I'm back
04:42 - in July I'm hoping to do a lot of
04:45 - tutorials with this machine learning
04:46 - library which is built on top of
04:49 - tensorflow Jas so if you want to learn
04:52 - more about ml 5 let me give you some
04:54 - links go to ml 5ks org I would also
04:57 - recommend you go to ITP dot NYU edu
05:00 - slash adjacent now adjacent come on ITP
05:06 - at NYU dot edu you can do it you can
05:08 - node adjacent is an online journal from
05:11 - ITP which is the program here at New
05:15 - York University's Tisch School of the
05:16 - Arts where I work and there are actually
05:19 - articles by Lauren McCarthy Adi Melanie
05:23 - C ah knows that COBOL Rupa Dominick
05:26 - Michael Allison Parrish so I encourage
05:28 - you to read all of all of this that
05:30 - interest you in this journal in if
05:32 - you're interested in ml5 you should read
05:35 - everything else but
05:36 - five article I think but if you want to
05:38 - know a little bit more about the
05:39 - background of ml5 like click on this
05:42 - this is the article I put together
05:44 - describing all the people who have
05:46 - worked on the projects and their
05:48 - contributions so you can scroll through
05:51 - here to find out about the history of
05:52 - the project different artists who have
05:55 - visited ITP and contributed there are
05:58 - some interactive demos like this one
06:01 - look that's me and I'm broccoli oh we
06:07 - hit allow oh I can't look oh whoa oh
06:15 - this one I'm still broccoli all right
06:17 - let's move on I think we need to fix
06:19 - that one I'm going to generate some text
06:22 - I'm going to run style transfer I'm
06:27 - gonna kill this computer I did it too
06:29 - many times let's see if this one works
06:32 - this is gonna be great
06:34 - oh yeah see remember how I said I was
06:37 - going to do a ukulele tuner hit the
06:44 - right pitch D
06:46 - [Music]
06:59 - so this is a great Hannah Davis put this
07:02 - together it's using a model pre-trained
07:06 - model known as CREP clip-clip and it
07:10 - detects pitch quite accurately and the
07:13 - goal of this game is to try to sing the
07:16 - correct note F sharp all right so that's
07:19 - one demo and we keep going down here see
07:22 - what else is here we have a word to Veck
07:24 - model pizza is to humans as fish is to
07:27 - birds and we have pose net let's see if
07:31 - this one works which was ported the
07:33 - tensorflow J s by Dan Ovid so I'm gonna
07:36 - do tutorials using all of these things
07:41 - all week this week but I've I guess I'm
07:44 - gonna come back in July and be doing
07:45 - these some information about data and
07:48 - responsible data practices scrolling
07:50 - through here thank you to Google
07:53 - Creative Lab and the Google brain team
07:55 - and the pair initiative and the big
07:57 - picture research group many different
07:59 - groups that Google's supported this
08:00 - project and there are links down at the
08:03 - bottom for where you can find more
08:05 - information oh new sponsor welcome new
08:08 - sponsor
08:10 - Divya Khanna thank you for the
08:13 - sponsorship Wow
08:15 - alright so that's what I want to make
08:16 - that announcement about ml5 and let me
08:20 - be clear that while this is a project
08:22 - that I did work on I am one small tiny
08:26 - piece of many many people who
08:29 - contributed to this we can see a list of
08:32 - many of their names here oh I also if we
08:35 - go to twitter.com slash ml 5 j s this is
08:39 - the ml 5 Twitter account and if I go to
08:43 - Twitter / Schiffman all there's gonna be
08:45 - all sorts of nonsense there I got to see
08:47 - if I can find well what is that oh my
08:50 - god
08:52 - this is me waiting there's like ads here
08:57 - I don't get ads when I and I'm just
09:02 - trying to find the thread oh this is
09:03 - really lame with me this is the thread
09:05 - in Reverse but here we go
09:09 - this particular thread is a thread where
09:13 - I attempt to just quickly describe all
09:15 - the people who have worked on in project
09:18 - and I there are more people than I'm
09:20 - describing here if you go to the github
09:22 - and if you're someone who's contributed
09:25 - I'm alive and I'm not crediting you
09:27 - properly please get in touch with me
09:29 - because it's my goal really important to
09:34 - be generous with thanks and credits in
09:37 - this world of open-source and creative
09:40 - coding and education that I live in all
09:43 - right oh yes
09:46 - another new sponsor damiano's the Nardo
09:50 - so now I'm gonna get to the 500,000
09:54 - coding challenge and let me get myself
10:01 - set up for that so what I need to do on
10:05 - fluent some music here
10:12 - okay I've got to warm the body up and
10:16 - hope it's Izzie there okay
10:19 - I'm gonna look on github.com let's look
10:24 - for mapa
10:25 - that's not let's look for a map I'm
10:30 - looking for it so I need this URL
10:33 - there's a documentation website as well
10:36 - let's go to here perfect let's go to the
10:55 - desktop and p5 G - B subscriber or
11:06 - YouTube this
11:11 - [Music]
11:16 - [Music]
11:29 - [Music]
11:41 - all right subscribe our subscriber so
11:47 - I've got some CSV files here then I'm
11:53 - going to use for the data you'll need
11:56 - this folder
12:04 - [Music]
12:31 - all right everyone all right so let me
12:48 - cycle these cameras so I'm gonna tend to
12:52 - do something very simple here and I'm
13:04 - getting a great suggestion from the chat
13:06 - burgerbob rights as a 500,000 special
13:08 - try using new things like visual studio
13:10 - code or live server all right I've got
13:12 - got motivation for all of you watching
13:14 - let's see if we can get to a million
13:16 - subscribers in the next 10 minutes and
13:18 - if that happens I'll switch to visual
13:19 - studio code I mean how about how much
13:22 - longer Adams even gonna be around
13:23 - shouldn't I get to enjoy it while it's
13:25 - still here I love my Adam editor it's
13:29 - just so comfortable for me all right so
13:37 - I'm thinking of using the I'm thinking
13:46 - of using the leaflet API so I think I've
13:52 - enough to say all this again but
13:53 - matthijs is a project oh there's another
13:56 - medium processing or map I'll see if I
14:02 - can get this here we go map attach a s
14:07 - is a project that was a google Summer of
14:10 - Code project from last summer 2017
14:13 - it really had intended to do some
14:15 - tutorials with it back in the fall but
14:19 - somehow I didn't get around to it and
14:23 - this is an article describing it
14:24 - apparently my name is here whose article
14:26 - for some reason but Cristobal Valenzuela
14:28 - is the creator of the map a library and
14:31 - what it does and this is oh this is a
14:34 - wonderful example when Ben fries
14:36 - original projects called zip decode
14:39 - which is part of his book visualizing
14:43 - data
14:45 - and so this is a project this library
14:48 - allows you to interface with another
14:52 - napping API like Google Maps or leaflet
14:57 - or if we go back to the examples map box
15:02 - and basically embed a map from one of
15:08 - these other libraries into your webpage
15:11 - put a canvas on top of it and it gives
15:14 - you functionality to as you move around
15:16 - and zoom through the map you can redraw
15:19 - whatever you're drawing on top of it and
15:21 - resize it according to how you're moving
15:22 - around of zooming in the map so this is
15:24 - where this functionality is stuff that
15:26 - I'm going to be using this library for
15:28 - it's doing really all of the heavy
15:30 - lifting and so I think I'll start with
15:32 - leaflet because it doesn't require an
15:34 - API key but and look I can play just
15:40 - copy-paste this example basically gonna
15:42 - do exactly this example but I'm gonna
15:45 - I'm not gonna copy/paste this example
15:47 - I'm going to try to write it in my own
15:48 - way and look at this and there's some
15:51 - tutorials here introduction to web Maps
15:55 - oh this is amazing look at all this
15:57 - wonderful documentation and examples and
16:00 - projections and this sort of thing also
16:02 - much wonderful information here so what
16:11 - was I saying
16:11 - I sort of looking at the chat this is
16:13 - what happens to me all the time and I
16:14 - should just have a rule there's actually
16:15 - a big there's a piece of paper here a
16:17 - little special treat for all of you on
16:19 - the wall back here behind the camera
16:23 - there's a piece of paper taped to the
16:25 - wall and this is what it says on it look
16:29 - here as I try to remember to look at you
16:33 - my friends my my I haven't seen that mr.
16:39 - Rogers
16:40 - documentary yet but I hear it's amazing
16:42 - and I wanted to say my neighbors there
16:46 - for a second but I don't think that's
16:47 - okay guy
16:51 - okay so look here hello so what I what I
16:56 - have is the data let me put the
16:58 - data in here actually so let me open up
17:01 - Adam I have to oh boy oh maybe I can
17:07 - preview this so I have a subscribers I
17:12 - have I have subscribers by country and I
17:16 - also have I also have I believe watch
17:21 - time the amount of minutes watched by
17:25 - country interestingly enough and this is
17:27 - for all time this is since the channel
17:30 - was started so this probably doesn't
17:32 - accurately reflect say the the countries
17:35 - in the last 30 days but and we can see
17:37 - here United States is at the top that's
17:40 - like it's not a surprise given that to
17:42 - the country where I am Germany where's
17:46 - Mexico come on Mexico that's right go
17:49 - Mexico alright I'll be Germany I like
17:51 - you do great for Mexico so what was I
18:05 - saying use that data for machine
18:07 - learning okay so I think I just gotta
18:09 - get started with this I should have
18:12 - practiced this right so here here
18:31 - just want to see leaflet
18:43 - basic example just saying like what's a
18:47 - good oh this is also such a great
18:50 - reference maybe I can make this doesn't
19:02 - I don't want to put even though it's
19:05 - they here on the internet I prefer not
19:07 - to put somebody's email address on it so
19:10 - right now live streaming okay I guess I
19:13 - don't need to reference to this page
19:14 - I'll just reference that it's down here
19:16 - and then taxi routes
19:20 - Torrio's simple map yeah I guess we
19:27 - could follow this tutorial
19:36 - you see this ah yep all right
19:42 - this tutorial is what I'm going to
19:44 - follow perfect there's a tutorial
19:49 - written for me to do the coding
19:52 - challenge Denmark there's definitely a
19:57 - lot of people from Denmark alright we
19:59 - are going to get started our live
20:06 - streams included in the data yes well
20:09 - okay so just to be clear and I guess I
20:12 - should say this during the I mean this
20:14 - is the I have this weird thing that I do
20:16 - where I like ramble and then I start but
20:18 - it's all me just talking but the
20:21 - question was asked by Medan are live
20:23 - streams included in the data so what
20:26 - I've done to get this data is I've
20:28 - logged into my creator studio on YouTube
20:30 - and I've done the export to CSV so I'm
20:32 - entirely relying on insta microphone
20:36 - it's all sort of off I'm entirely
20:38 - relying on what YouTube is giving me and
20:41 - so and I'm not doing this with the
20:44 - YouTube API which would be interesting
20:46 - to do but yeah okay alright here we go
20:54 - let's get a move-on what's a good let's
20:56 - start with here or here or here or here
21:04 - this is good okay
21:12 - the mic is the mic okay I I could put on
21:17 - the hoodie and then attaches to the
21:18 - hoodie a little bit better but it's do
21:20 - there's like this like heatwave crazy
21:22 - we wave in New York City sound is fine
21:24 - picture is fine
21:42 - what time is it now 4:23 all right we're
21:45 - doing well the mic shakes a bit when you
21:48 - were dancing and knocks against your
21:49 - body all right let me switch let me
21:53 - switch to this let's try this and see if
22:00 - this is a little bit more stable
22:02 - I like Austin to the chat rightz as long
22:10 - as you're not moving around like crazy
22:12 - the mic is fine well I have got news for
22:16 - you have you watch this YouTube channel
22:19 - before let's see how this goes oh this
22:24 - is my 2017 camera all right
22:33 - this makes it much more stable I don't
22:35 - know what happened to my shirt oh it's
22:40 - because it's under hold on hold on
22:43 - everybody just bear with me this is very
22:46 - professional it's a very professional
22:48 - livestream thing here going high-tech
22:55 - professional operation I've got going on
22:57 - here teams of producers video camera
23:02 - operators and script writers and just a
23:06 - sea of people out here tell you what to
23:08 - do with my ears secret messages okay I
23:20 - think this is gonna be better now plus I
23:23 - can do this all right
23:32 - how's that better everybody Kotick trade
23:37 - brought to you by mysterious liquid
23:40 - inside a cup usually I attempt to use my
23:47 - clean canteen not an official sponsor
23:50 - because it's better than throwing away
23:51 - these paper cups but today that's what I
23:55 - have all right try moving around
24:12 - okay so Alka says I need to try moving
24:14 - around like crazy
24:15 - Oh Thank You Dennis for the super chat
24:22 - is the mic okay now what's this I can't
24:27 - do it the pickles
24:28 - okay alright let's I think I gotta get
24:32 - started here I am NOT please be so
24:48 - annoying we're not gonna include that
24:58 - hello I'm making a video coding
25:00 - challenge today to celebrate some large
25:03 - subscribers which is kind of insane and
25:06 - then right after this I'm going to go to
25:07 - the barbershop so please I beware I
25:10 - really let this go here I'm gonna deal
25:12 - with it alright what am I going to do
25:14 - today I'm going to celebrate the
25:16 - subscribers the viewers of the coding
25:18 - train with a visualization and I'm going
25:21 - to use a pretend library that I've been
25:23 - meaning to use for quite a while called
25:25 - mapa j s it was a google Summer of Code
25:28 - project last summer 2017 with the
25:31 - processing foundation created by
25:33 - Cristobal Valenzuela so there if you go
25:37 - to the Napa j/s org website there's a
25:40 - ton of tutorials introduction to web
25:43 - Maps a history of different projections
25:46 - so much interesting good stuff here I
25:48 - also if you scroll down here and really
25:49 - recommend taking a look at Mimi Onew
25:51 - OHA's everything is spatial data and
25:53 - digital mapping work so I love to get
25:57 - into all this but I'm just gonna try to
25:58 - do something really basic I have on my
26:02 - computer if I could find it why didn't I
26:06 - get organized before I started this
26:07 - YouTube here we go I have some CSV files
26:11 - these CSV files I downloaded through the
26:14 - creator studio so I logged in with my
26:17 - account in the Creator studio I went to
26:18 - the analytics and there's an export to
26:20 - CSV so presumably there is some way for
26:22 - me to get this data with the YouTube API
26:24 - and I would encourage you hopefully I'm
26:26 - hoping people will make stuff either
26:28 - with their own YouTube channels or I
26:29 - think it's okay for me to publish this
26:31 - data there's no user information in it
26:34 - so I will check but I'll probably I'll I
26:36 - will also publish this data as well
26:38 - people want to revisit and interesting
26:40 - ways for me or not for me for you but
26:42 - anyway whatever you get the point is
26:45 - this is going very well
26:47 - why have you subscribed to this channel
26:53 - tutorial things for you to watch out
26:55 - there when I was what I was going to
26:58 - show you is I have all of subscribers by
27:01 - country and I have also all of I have
27:07 - watched I'm by country this is the watch
27:10 - time in minutes apparently people have
27:13 - watched a candy I can't even read that
27:15 - that number it's 41 million 100 in the
27:20 - US some 41 million minutes that's really
27:22 - it's really weird I mean wasn't just one
27:26 - person I hope it's gonna this is a
27:29 - mapping visualization tutorial isn't it
27:31 - okay let's go okay so how what I'm going
27:34 - to do here well first so I'm going to
27:35 - come back to mapa the github for mapa is
27:40 - here by the way that all these URLs will
27:41 - be in the video's description if you're
27:43 - still watching or you just left and
27:45 - reading the description however watching
27:47 - some other machine learning tutorial but
27:53 - I'm gonna I'm gonna use this I'm is
27:54 - going to follow this tutorial by Chris
27:57 - called simple now
27:58 - mapa is an interface to other mapping
28:02 - API is like Google Maps map box leaflet
28:07 - and maybe I'm missing MapQuest Welbeck
28:10 - quest still exists that's amazing I'm
28:12 - saying look Map Quest so I'm gonna use
28:16 - leaflet just because from you don't need
28:19 - an API key for leaflet so it makes it a
28:22 - little easier for me to just roll on in
28:23 - and make this project but I encourage
28:25 - you to try this with Google Maps or map
28:27 - box yourself ok bye well let's get
28:29 - started here so the first thing I don't
28:32 - want to do actually it's nothing to do
28:33 - with mapping I want to say function
28:35 - preload because I want to load in all
28:38 - the data so I want to say just celebrate
28:43 - I'm gonna use Const Const is a way of
28:47 - declaring a variable that you're not
28:49 - allowed to that you're saying I'm never
28:51 - going to reassign this variable to a new
28:54 - value there's some nuance to that but
28:56 - that's the basic idea so I'm gonna
28:57 - preach really a means to protect myself
28:59 - here so I'm gonna say Const subscriber
29:03 - subscriber data then in preload I'm
29:06 - gonna say I can't spell subscriber
29:09 - subscriber data equals load table whew
29:15 - now low table is a function inside of p5
29:19 - as part of peek the p5 chess library
29:21 - that is specially suited for loading CSV
29:24 - data tabular data some other videos
29:27 - where I use that and describe that in
29:28 - more detail so I want to just let's
29:31 - start with subscribers underscore geo
29:33 - subscribers underscore geo dot CSV then
29:38 - I just want to in setup then say console
29:41 - dot log subscriber data so let's first
29:44 - make sure I can actually load the CSV in
29:46 - the first place and I'm gonna go over
29:49 - here hit refresh missing initializer in
29:54 - constellation oh okay well I can't use
29:57 - Const here this is such a failure
30:00 - already so I can't use Const why because
30:03 - this is me reassigning hit kinda sign it
30:06 - up there that's of use let some other
30:10 - day I'll find the perfect
30:12 - I mean you just can't somewhere else in
30:13 - this you'll see it's constant it's very
30:15 - hard to say all right so now we're
30:17 - loading hmm it's still loading
30:19 - this really is not going very well I
30:22 - don't think it's taking all this time to
30:24 - load I think that I have a mistake load
30:30 - table subscribers geode now let me just
30:32 - see here what version I mean the recent
30:35 - version of p5 there there was at some
30:37 - point an issue with using load table in
30:40 - preload I thought that had been ironed
30:42 - out by now let me make a let me just
30:46 - make let's do a little test here
30:50 - well this by the way this videos gonna
30:52 - have lots of extra stuff in it I'm just
30:54 - letting this go no editing no editing
30:58 - I'm gonna make a test dot CSV file so
31:01 - you know it's like an hour or 500
31:03 - minutes that would be appropriate
31:04 - all right so abc123
31:08 - so I'm just gonna make a test this is
31:11 - how I like to debug things and I make a
31:12 - test CSV file just try loading that oh I
31:18 - saw something there for a second look
31:20 - it's like they're pre load setup hmm
31:23 - hold on what is going on what what
31:28 - craziness let's see here subscribe or
31:32 - data it's there check the network tab so
31:40 - is this a bug in p5 let's take a look at
31:43 - the p5 github ok let's look for take
31:58 - that back load table I would look under
32:03 - issues cannot no let's try to look the
32:12 - load table preload this looks like it
32:19 - was fixed though
32:23 - this looks familiar to me oh my god I am
32:27 - just doomed to repeat the same videos
32:29 - over and over again
32:30 - I made an earthquake visualize it's
32:32 - visualizer and I think probably I ran
32:35 - into this issue then as well yeah all
32:45 - right all right all right we're gonna
32:48 - let's go back to this what is going on
32:50 - let's put in a draw function and see if
32:59 - that helps anything restart the browser
33:11 - yeah let's just switch to X or because i
33:13 - every every few weeks i redo solving xor
33:17 - with some machine learning technique all
33:19 - right I don't think restarting the
33:20 - browser is gonna do anything here but
33:22 - it's not a bad point whoops okay all
33:32 - right there's a guy there's going to be
33:33 - an edit point here
33:39 - oh it's just being like incredibly slow
33:49 - alko was saying check the network tab
34:01 - why is it being so slow yeah it's just
34:06 - slow so can anyone explain this to me
34:10 - this is going to be an edit queen that's
34:15 - why I made a test file
34:29 - like why did it take 11 seconds to load
34:32 - that file no but I switched to using
34:37 - test dot CSV which is a tiny file and
34:50 - these aren't even that big 12 bytes why
34:55 - did it take a look that's like one
34:56 - second per byte why is it doing that
35:15 - restart the server that's a good idea oh
35:18 - maybe the server is like horrible at
35:21 - this
35:30 - No all right let's try
35:49 - there we go all right so weird weird the
35:55 - Python server was like all right so I'm
35:57 - just gonna go back all right so I had we
36:03 - had to we had to edit there there's no
36:04 - way around it I learned something new so
36:06 - in the browser there's this in the
36:08 - console in the in the developer tools
36:10 - there's this thing called network and
36:11 - I'm gonna hit refresh right now and oops
36:14 - sorry
36:15 - I'm gonna put it at localhost 8080 I'm
36:24 - waiting waiting for it to load the file
36:27 - is only 12 bytes this this was just
36:44 - meant to be a demonstration
36:48 - [Music]
37:04 - [Music]
37:25 - [Music]
37:38 - well I was fine with 11 seconds that
37:41 - would be like a demonstration all right
37:51 - I'm going to demonstrate this a
37:53 - different way okay
38:07 - all right I had to edit this there there
38:10 - was no way around editing it there I did
38:13 - however I think I have a path to move
38:15 - forward and I've learned something new
38:17 - inside the developer tools I usually
38:19 - just look at this console thing there is
38:21 - this tab called Network and what we can
38:23 - see here look at this the test dot CSV
38:25 - file is just pending pending it's never
38:30 - load ago it finally loaded it took uh I
38:36 - can't I want to be able to see it took
38:38 - 26 seconds 26 seconds to load that file
38:43 - that file test dot CSV is exactly 12
38:48 - bytes meaning that's like two seconds
38:50 - per bytes this is very byte very
38:52 - unreasonable so I don't know what's
38:53 - going on but I I don't want to blame
38:56 - anybody nobody's fault things just work
38:59 - if they work sometimes but I'm getting
39:00 - some weird behavior with this Python
39:02 - server that I'm using and actually if I
39:05 - change and use I have a node server HTTP
39:08 - - server also available on my computer
39:12 - so I'm gonna run that be a terminal HTTP
39:14 - - server and then I'm gonna go back over
39:16 - here oh wait no have to go to a
39:19 - different yes
39:20 - different port and look at this three
39:23 - milliseconds test CSV so now we can go
39:25 - back we're getting somewhere we're
39:27 - getting somewhere
39:28 - I can go back to subscribers underscore
39:32 - geo dot CSV there we go
39:36 - okay now we've got that file I'm gonna
39:39 - go back to the console I'm gonna look at
39:41 - subscriber data and I can see there we
39:43 - go I've got an array with a 237 rows
39:48 - that means there's 237 oh there's fifty
39:52 - three columns there's lots of extra data
39:54 - in there other and there's two hundred
39:55 - thirty seven rows now one thing is all
39:58 - the cop none of the columns have a name
40:00 - so one of the things I want to do is p5
40:02 - if I give it this nice little second
40:05 - argument and say header I think that
40:08 - says the first row in the CSV file is
40:10 - the header and we can see that if I
40:12 - click on here you can see these are all
40:14 - the headers that are
40:14 - actually there in that first row so now
40:17 - let me go back and refresh I'm gonna
40:19 - look at the subscriber data again go
40:21 - look at here we could see ah there it is
40:22 - so country name country ID and
40:25 - subscribers and then there's other all
40:27 - sorts of other columns transactions and
40:31 - ad revenue and all sorts of stuff so I'm
40:33 - probably going to clean up this data
40:34 - when I publish this just to have only
40:38 - the first three columns country name
40:41 - country ID and subscribers that's all
40:43 - that I'm gonna use for this example so
40:46 - now what's next I need a way of
40:49 - iterating over every single one of those
40:51 - so let's just look at how I might do
40:52 - that I don't know how but for let I
40:57 - equals 0 I is less than subscriber data
41:00 - dot I don't know total columns let's
41:03 - look at the API p5.js org let's look at
41:07 - the reference I'm gonna look for p5
41:09 - table and I guess if I go here to p5
41:13 - table we're gonna see add row remove row
41:16 - get rogue find row find Rose match row
41:19 - I'm looking for total uh-huh
41:26 - Oh columns rows looking for Rose it's
41:31 - just in a field subscriber data dot rows
41:34 - I plus plus then I'm going to say the
41:38 - row is subscriber data get row I and let
41:43 - me just look at the rows go back here
41:48 - let's look at
41:57 - I haven't done this in a while
42:01 - line 10 Oh Rose it's an array of all the
42:05 - rows that's even more convenient so let
42:09 - row it's not a number I thought it was a
42:13 - total of subscriber data row I can use a
42:15 - for of loop and now I can just look at
42:22 - each row one at a time there we go
42:25 - that's each row one at a time then I can
42:27 - say console log row get column
42:32 - what were the columns again country
42:34 - let's look country oh it's sort of like
42:36 - atom just knows it's not a country ID
42:39 - and let's do this ooh get column is not
42:44 - oh maybe it's just get yes there we go
42:48 - get it's just get and I get the country
42:50 - ID now I want to get a console log row
42:54 - get what was it called subscribers okay
43:04 - awesome
43:06 - there we go so I now have a country ID
43:10 - followed by subscribers country ID
43:13 - followed by subscribers okay we're
43:15 - getting somewhere
43:17 - should probably find the minimum and the
43:19 - maximum and normalize things but we'll
43:21 - worry about that later okay now now
43:23 - let's go back to the mapping tutorial
43:25 - what's been like two hours since I
43:27 - started this I'm gonna go back to this
43:29 - simple map example and first of all I
43:32 - need to include a reference to this map
43:35 - map a library in my HTML file so I'm
43:38 - gonna just copy paste this here and I'm
43:41 - gonna go to index dot HTML and one of
43:45 - these days I'll learn how all this fancy
43:46 - new module stuff works but there's no
43:49 - way I like to do it right now when a
43:51 - reference that library let's go back to
43:53 - the tutorial Oh
43:54 - welcome to reading through a tutorial
43:55 - and copying the code over to your code
43:57 - code but thank you to this excellent
44:00 - documentation for the map library so I
44:02 - want to create a look at this there we
44:05 - go
44:05 - Const let's create a new map instance so
44:10 - I want to make a new
44:11 - back pulling from the leaflet API just
44:15 - to be clear leaflet is this a jaw
44:21 - open-source JavaScript library for
44:22 - mobile-friendly interactive maps so
44:24 - again you can use leaflet directly by
44:28 - just going right there and looking at
44:30 - how the code works mapa provides a layer
44:32 - on top of that also because it you can
44:36 - pick other things besides leaflet as
44:38 - well as it integrates nicely with p5 and
44:40 - probably other JavaScript libraries
44:41 - alright so now let's just refresh let's
44:45 - make sure things are still working
44:46 - things are some ooh there was an error
44:48 - at the top there ref because it's mime
44:53 - type is X not executable what did I do
44:57 - wrong here hmm we have a little bit of
44:59 - an issue strange why did map oh let me
45:11 - just take what's going on here why did I
45:13 - get that error message let me take out
45:15 - this console.log Oh Oh No okay
45:39 - doesn't seem to mind it with the p5
45:41 - libraries hold on
45:47 - there's no added weight
45:56 - nobody no one's telling me anything
45:58 - what's going on here let's look at this
46:01 - Oh interesting
46:11 - so I think it's broken I don't know if
46:16 - Chris is watching yeah so this let's see
46:25 - hold on now let's look at NP oh look at
46:37 - this point five I got point zero zero
46:41 - four let's look at NPM
46:42 - I mean NPM mapa
46:59 - this is the same exact link I mean I
47:03 - could just download the library whoops
47:09 - yeah weird so I'm just I don't know why
47:13 - 0 0.5 is not working I assume everything
47:20 - will work fine and 0 0.4 I hope that's
47:23 - not going to trip me up but let's file a
47:32 - github issue oh yeah look at this
47:46 - ah yes yes look at this
47:57 - oh look at that there we go okay so I
48:01 - can use js2 liver okay
48:05 - well this case that's okay to see the
48:07 - end if age is broken that's good see let
48:10 - me shake shy shy shy I won't write a
48:12 - note here cuz chris is there in the slag
48:15 - group alright so this is my I'm gonna
48:16 - use this okay I'm back okay I'm back it
48:25 - turns out that there's just a little bug
48:27 - with this CDN link and so I'm gonna use
48:30 - a different CDN link which is this one
48:32 - and it's working check the map web page
48:35 - for whatever the currently working
48:37 - version of this is by the time this
48:39 - video gets published
48:40 - hopefully it'll it'll probably be fixed
48:42 - okay Napa is now loaded excellent okay
48:44 - so now we can go back and we can go to
48:47 - this tutorial once again I was on this
48:51 - simple map tutorial and we can see here
48:53 - what's the next step I want to create
48:56 - now there's different kinds of maps I
48:58 - can create there's what I'm and the
49:00 - world is broader than just this but I'm
49:02 - gonna talk about two right now there's a
49:04 - static map and a tile map a static map
49:07 - is a map that's just give me the map
49:09 - it's the image of the map I'm gonna draw
49:11 - it I'm never gonna change a tile map is
49:13 - one that I want to move around zoom in
49:15 - and out of and the reason why it's
49:16 - called a tile map is because the way
49:18 - that the mapping API has generally load
49:20 - it is they loaded as a bunch of
49:21 - different tiles because you don't wanna
49:23 - get one big image all at once you get a
49:24 - bunch of different image than they get
49:26 - tiled so I want to create a tile map and
49:29 - this gives that the arguments here is
49:32 - like well what do I want
49:34 - where do I want the map to be centered
49:36 - around and what zoom level do I want to
49:39 - be so let's try napa my map equals map a
49:43 - tile tile map so i want to say i'm gonna
49:46 - go back to here and i'm gonna say I'm
49:48 - gonna say let train map and I'm gonna
49:55 - say a train map equals mapa tile map and
49:59 - let's just give it a latitude longitude
50:03 - of zero zero and a zoom level of four
50:05 - that was what's in the tutorial and
50:06 - let's see if we see that
50:09 - at all I'm gonna go here and so now one
50:15 - thing is hi let me let me meet saying
50:18 - let me get rid of the canvas all right
50:21 - so I probably missing a step here I know
50:23 - that I have to overlay the canvas but
50:26 - let's see I don't see the map yet do I
50:28 - need to overlay the canvas or yes I
50:31 - guess if I don't overlay the canvas the
50:35 - map doesn't show up perhaps creator of
50:40 - map Allah is in in the chat right here
50:42 - so I might here in a second what I'm
50:44 - saying that's wrong so I'm going to so I
50:49 - need a reference to the canvas I'm gonna
50:51 - say canvas then I'm gonna say canvas
50:54 - equals create canvas and then I want to
50:57 - say to which do I say which the the map
51:01 - a map I want to say the training map
51:04 - I want the canvas to sit on top of it
51:07 - overlay yeah I do so confirm breaking
51:11 - news I do have to overlay I'm not going
51:15 - to see the map unless I overlay the
51:16 - canvas on top of it okay so these are
51:18 - the steps here I want a canvas that I
51:20 - could draw on I want a tile map and then
51:22 - I want my canvas to sit on top of it so
51:24 - now if we go here whoops
51:30 - train map overlay is not a function
51:33 - mm-hmm Oh camera that's another edit
51:37 - point train map overlay train map
51:45 - overlay is not a function okay what I'm
51:47 - doing a terrible job here let me go to
51:50 - the tutorial my map dot overlay canvas
51:54 - did I take overlay with a capital L yes
51:56 - I did overlay is one word people
51:59 - lowercase L okay here we go unload setup
52:06 - sketch mmm what did I get wrong now new
52:13 - map a leaflet
52:18 - just giving up on the no editing thing
52:24 - does it not work with preload I have
52:27 - notifications on my phone does it not
52:40 - like preload let's just take this out
52:43 - for a second
52:44 - shouldn't matter
52:56 - line 14 which is here canvas train map
53:01 - and actually this map a tile map overlay
53:08 - canvas hmm click back through the stack
53:14 - Oh does it expect to promise no oh I did
53:21 - it not ready yet
53:22 - let's look no this is what it says in
53:25 - the tutorial here let's try previous
53:31 - version of mapa nah there we go okay
53:44 - everybody we found another bug just
53:52 - wanna make sure
54:01 - why am I not able to move around in the
54:04 - map
54:16 - we just make sure I get this working
54:17 - first how come I don't actually see a
54:28 - map oh damn I missing like another step
54:30 - I didn't really read the full tutorial
54:33 - oh yeah I need to put these in I need to
54:43 - put I need to say what's style
54:47 - we just need to specify a set of tiles a
54:50 - warning message so I didn't see the
54:52 - warning message oh you know what there
54:56 - is a warning message I think I have
54:57 - warnings turned off how do I turn
55:00 - warnings back on you used to the way I
55:09 - used to do this YouTube channel is I
55:11 - would do this like in class during the
55:13 - day and I would work all this stuff out
55:16 - then it would come on to YouTube and I'd
55:18 - have all this stuff worked out read the
55:22 - manual I be going wait where is the
55:24 - setting for warnings I'm kidding very
55:27 - like very sweaty over here show warnings
55:32 - I want to show warnings it's not showing
55:38 - me the warnings I don't need to go into
55:42 - settings for the warnings show warnings
55:46 - show warnings
55:48 - show me the warnings click on filter
55:52 - output there we go okay okay
55:59 - okay okay all right
56:03 - backing up backing up backing up
56:27 - Oh does point-five require a promise no
56:31 - I don't think so yeah the the error is
56:35 - probably a p5 error so let me just move
56:42 - on here okay oh it's not a p-51 okay I
56:51 - never so much for my no editing so is
56:55 - there was another edit there
56:57 - unfortunately whatever reason whatever
56:59 - I'm doing is throwing giving me an error
57:01 - I discovered if I revert back to one
57:03 - version earlier of the map a library
57:06 - then the error goes away so I can
57:08 - refresh oops I have to hit save and then
57:12 - I can refresh AHA now okay so first of
57:15 - all if you're watching this video hope
57:17 - the source code is hopefully going to by
57:19 - the time you're watching this be using
57:20 - the most recent version of map but maybe
57:21 - I'll have to figure that out but for now
57:23 - I'm going to keep going now
57:24 - interestingly enough it says you are not
57:26 - using any tiles for your map try with so
57:29 - one of the things is I have to specify a
57:32 - particular set of tiles that I want to
57:35 - load and I would have just read further
57:38 - down in the tutorial it would show me
57:40 - that actually one way to do that is to
57:42 - put all of those things like I was
57:45 - saying I want the center to be zero zero
57:46 - and the zoom level to be four now I need
57:48 - to also give it a style all those can go
57:50 - into a JavaScript object so I'm just
57:52 - gonna copy paste this from here this is
57:56 - a YouTube video where I am copy pasting
57:58 - code from the tutorial and like making
58:01 - lots of mistakes still somehow anyway
58:03 - and then I'm going to put this here and
58:05 - then I'm going to put instead of putting
58:09 - the arguments directly in the function
58:10 - I'm just gonna write the variable name
58:12 - options we are now going to refresh
58:14 - again and now look at this there is my
58:19 - map so one thing I really want to do is
58:21 - I want to give myself more space to work
58:24 - with so let's try like 800 by 600 and I
58:28 - think I want to zoom out by default a
58:30 - lot more so what I know I think a lower
58:33 - number would be zooming out
58:35 - yeah that's maybe too much 1.5 all right
58:39 - that'll do to start okay so this is what
58:41 - how I
58:41 - want it to load initially and again
58:44 - maybe zero zero isn't the best middle
58:46 - point and there's all sorts of other
58:48 - things I could do but no we've got the
58:50 - map there now I just want to do
58:52 - something I just want to say ellipse
58:58 - 100-150 let's just see what happens if I
59:00 - draw and I'm gonna do a nice purplish
59:05 - color which is my favorite color do this
59:07 - look at this there's that ellipse
59:09 - now that ellipse is staying where it is
59:11 - so they're at a minimum what I have
59:13 - right now is the ability to draw over
59:17 - the map and I can do all of the map
59:19 - interactions and my p5 canvases right
59:22 - there
59:22 - now I have to be careful if I were to
59:24 - put this background here I don't see
59:26 - that map anymore and what I really
59:29 - should be doing is using the clear
59:30 - function the clear function is like
59:32 - putting a background that's fully
59:33 - transparent so this now you can see I
59:36 - don't know if you could notice this
59:37 - before without the clear function there
59:39 - was some funny anti-aliasing going on
59:40 - because I was drawing the circle
59:41 - actually on top of itself multiple times
59:43 - okay but the point is what I want to do
59:45 - is let's say I have a circle that's on
59:47 - the map over here if i zoom in I want
59:50 - that circle to stay where it is and grow
59:52 - with the map okay so how do we do that
59:56 - let's go back to the tutorial and I'm
59:59 - not gonna worry about lat/long but oh
60:02 - yeah no no I do want to worry about that
60:04 - so this is the key here lap map lat/long
60:08 - to pixel so the idea here is that I have
60:11 - a latitude and longitude and I want to
60:14 - find the pixel location of that no
60:16 - matter where the map is so let's let's
60:20 - just take this no matter what the zoom
60:23 - is let's take this and copy it into our
60:27 - code and I should now see it refresh
60:36 - oops I got an error again
60:38 - la Oh my map I called a train map
60:47 - so we can see there is now a circle here
60:50 - hopefully on top of the country of
60:52 - Nigeria looks right to me
60:55 - and I can zoom in and we can see that
60:58 - circle is continuing to move as I move
61:02 - the map around now here's the thing so I
61:07 - happen to find that from the example
61:08 - thankfully I just got a message in the
61:11 - chat for the next thing was about to
61:12 - look for which is a data set that has
61:16 - the lat
61:17 - longitude value for every single country
61:19 - so I'm just gonna I think I could
61:21 - probably Google for it
61:22 - canonical countries CSV lat/long
61:26 - something like that would probably yes
61:28 - this is what I'm looking for I'm looking
61:29 - for the countries dot CSV data set and
61:32 - this now has a country each every
61:36 - country with the latitude and longitude
61:37 - associated with it so how do i download
61:39 - this country's that CSV you'd think
61:47 - there'd be a download of sprinkles paid
61:48 - somewhere somebody's gonna tell me how
61:53 - to download this uh tutorial guides I
61:56 - could star it I like it I'm gonna give
61:59 - it five stars
62:00 - uh I don't know I don't know where to
62:02 - download this samples overview no this
62:12 - menus not helping me I'm just looking to
62:20 - chat like I become so lazy in my live
62:23 - streaming that instead of trying to
62:24 - never figure anything out I just hit her
62:26 - wait till somebody that jet tell me what
62:28 - I'm this thing which is really not good
62:30 - oh my goodness is five o'clock already -
62:33 - this is not good this is not going as
62:35 - expected do I have to like query it
62:39 - somehow
62:40 - geo XML oh it's gonna give it to me in
62:43 - XML
62:53 - samples okay samples canonical concepts
62:58 - is it the geo on all files no geo not
63:08 - taught us entity no geographic canonical
63:12 - concepts don't download from here
63:22 - there's another oh that gist okay
63:27 - syndra sore huh schist and number one
63:39 - three four one six nine nine okay this
63:46 - will work
63:56 - okay download buttons in all files we
64:00 - hold on I really want to figure this out
64:02 - all files where's all files let me go
64:09 - back to samples tutorial all files
64:17 - downloads ah here we go
64:23 - but like tutorial date isn't weird this
64:27 - is crazy
64:28 - yeah it would be easier to copy/paste at
64:30 - this point wouldn't it my cuts over here
64:33 - I really need to just put the chat over
64:34 - there that's ridiculous this really
64:38 - seems insane am I in the right place
64:44 - even remotely close to the right place
64:48 - canonical concept geo all files
64:52 - downloads there we go same thing
65:00 - let's try downloading some of these
65:02 - toriel
65:12 - ah to sit it's got five countries in it
65:18 - okay so that's the tutorial
65:21 - maybe it's the DSP L tools
65:34 - alright I'm gonna give up I'm gonna give
65:36 - up and use that Geist at the bottom
65:47 - there's a CSV link okay hold on hold on
65:49 - Kelly Murphy is sending me a mess
65:51 - message public date okay hold on
65:56 - developers.googl e.com/apps-script
66:19 - CSV let's get this page that's not a
66:27 - dolly that's just to this page okay okay
66:49 - where's the gist okay okay if somebody
67:00 - can figure out for me you can figure out
67:03 - how you download this file sure I could
67:06 - copy paste it I can't find anywhere on
67:08 - this page of how to download this file
67:10 - and Norah in the chat seems to be
67:12 - telling me so I'm moving on
67:13 - I got a nice suggestion there is this
67:15 - github gist and I can just click over
67:17 - here to raw and this is now every single
67:20 - country code with the lat/long I'm going
67:23 - to assume that this is correct I'm going
67:25 - to copy paste this into a new file I'm
67:28 - gonna call this country's dot CSV and
67:34 - I'm gonna paste it in here so now I have
67:37 - au not CSV it's JSON excuse me
67:41 - countries JSON and so good so now I have
67:47 - all the countries and their lat/long by
67:49 - a and JSON so now I need to go back to
67:51 - my code and I am going to say let me
67:56 - have another variable called countries
67:57 - and I'm gonna say countries equals load
68:02 - JSON and countries dot JSON so now I
68:07 - want to just make sure that that came in
68:10 - okay console dot log countries well I'm
68:17 - gonna be going away for a couple weeks
68:19 - after I record this video and get back
68:20 - everything's gonna make sense and work
68:22 - again in my tutorials I'm not gonna make
68:24 - all these mistakes and never get
68:26 - anything that okay so there we go so now
68:28 - I can see excellent
68:30 - so I have I want to have beautiful the
68:32 - object I can actually
68:33 - look up by the country code great I can
68:38 - look up by the country code which is
68:40 - exactly what I want so now let us let me
68:43 - take this loop I'm gonna go over here
68:49 - kind of I think that in a moment I am
68:52 - going to now get the country ID now I
68:56 - think something a little bit funny is
68:58 - going on here where if I look here the
69:01 - country IDs are in capital letters and
69:04 - in my countries JSON file
69:06 - they're lowercase letters so I'm gonna
69:08 - need to be conscientious about that so I
69:10 - want to say let country equal Roget
69:16 - country ID and I'm gonna say I'm think I
69:20 - could just say to lower case is that a
69:24 - JavaScript function in Java there's
69:26 - definitely a string function that sends
69:28 - thing to lowercase so I think that's
69:30 - right then I can get the lat/long is is
69:36 - what I want to look at the countries by
69:41 - country and so now that's going to give
69:47 - me that array with lat/long and then the
69:50 - latitude is the lat/long index 0 and the
69:58 - longitude is the lat/long index 1 and
70:01 - now I'm gonna say I want to say the
70:07 - pixels pixel coordinate is train map and
70:13 - now I not hard coding it I'm getting it
70:16 - from that so now I say I'm getting it
70:20 - from that the JSON file lat/long and
70:23 - then now let's draw an ellipse at and
70:28 - I'm just gonna call this pics at pics X
70:32 - pix dot y 20/20 so now I should see a
70:38 - circle at every single country where
70:42 - there is at least one person who
70:43 - subscribes to the channel and here we go
70:46 - what did I get wrong here cannot read
70:49 - you know interestingly enough this is
70:52 - live this is like this very generic
70:55 - error that's coming up no matter what if
70:58 - I do something wrong sketched out yes
71:00 - line 41 what have I done wrong let me
71:02 - look let's look at these first console
71:08 - dot log country let's take a look to
71:11 - make sure my countries are actually
71:12 - correct those look right
71:14 - those look like reasonable country codes
71:17 - let's say no loop by the way because
71:19 - right now I just want to do it once okay
71:24 - so those look like the country codes now
71:30 - let's see so this is countries countries
71:38 - dot ad is that and so I should be saying
71:44 - a console.log lat/long let's look at
71:48 - that okay oh there's some that are
71:52 - undefined so first whatever reason I
71:55 - have some countries in my dataset that I
71:58 - don't have a lat/long for so I that's
72:01 - why I got that error message so I just
72:03 - need to be careful about that and I need
72:06 - to say only if lat/long exists like
72:10 - there's some that are undefined then I
72:13 - should be able to pull the lat longitude
72:15 - out and draw a circle and let me get rid
72:20 - of no loop now let me say fill 255 0 200
72:27 - let me put my semicolon there oh yes so
72:34 - look at this look at all of you
72:36 - beautiful people all over the world who
72:38 - are subscribed to this channel from all
72:40 - these different countries this is
72:42 - amazing oh and I got this horrible thing
72:45 - going on where I'm console logging got
72:47 - to get rid of that you do not want a
72:49 - console log from within a loop within a
72:51 - loop zillion things that'll really mess
72:54 - stuff up let's go find Australia
72:57 - Australia
72:59 - look at this let's can we find a country
73:02 - with nobody I'm not sure country that I
73:05 - need to so we really got the center of
73:08 - everything this is great okay so now
73:11 - we're getting somewhere
73:13 - I can see everything there and now what
73:20 - I want to do is actually size the
73:21 - circles according to the total number of
73:24 - subscribers okay hmm
73:28 - here's the thing Oh timeout for a sec
73:42 - okay here's the thing now first of all I
73:44 - want to use the whiteboard but I'm
73:46 - working on this color classifier with
73:48 - tensorflow yes these are all my notes
73:50 - from and I don't want to writes it so
73:52 - just bear with me here this is like a
73:54 - moment of insanity here I am going to
73:57 - talk you through something in a little
73:59 - like blank area where's the blankest the
74:01 - blankest of the blank areas looks like
74:03 - this is a nice little blank area over
74:05 - here that I can use can you see all that
74:12 - I got to get to the barbershop before it
74:15 - closes
74:17 - you can't go I'm in town looking like
74:19 - this we try that one more time alright
74:26 - here's the thing I want to talk you
74:27 - through something that's a really
74:28 - important little crucial detail here and
74:30 - I want to divert it for you but maybe
74:33 - what I can do is just turn the camera
74:35 - I'm working on this I'm working on this
74:39 - oh boy I shut the camera off by accident
74:44 - am i back yes I'm working on this
74:47 - tensorflow J s color classifier and I
74:51 - didn't want to race my notes for it so
74:53 - now I think I have some extra space over
74:54 - here so sorry for being completely like
74:56 - a crazy person
74:57 - not like whatever I'm gonna diagram this
74:59 - for you here so here's the thing I am
75:02 - drawing circles in p5 with the ellipse
75:04 - function can you see that I think you
75:07 - can the ellipse function so let's say
75:09 - this is a circle with a diet with a die
75:12 - diameter of 10 and this is a circle with
75:16 - a diameter of 5 okay circle with a
75:20 - diameter of 10 circle the diameter 5
75:22 - let's say this is a country with 10
75:23 - subscribers and this is the country with
75:25 - 5 subscribers have I visualized this
75:27 - accurately no the answer is no why
75:31 - think about this for a second if I were
75:33 - to do this this is a bar chart 5 and
75:36 - this is 10 you know this is accurate
75:38 - this is twice the size of this is this
75:41 - twice the size of this will the radius
75:43 - here is 5 I make these like 8 and 4 the
75:47 - point let me make these 8 in 4 just just
75:50 - please please please please allow me to
75:53 - make them 8 and 4 so the radius is 4 and
75:56 - the radius here is 2 right so what is
76:00 - the area of this pi r-squared 16 pi the
76:04 - area of this pi r squared 4 PI this is
76:07 - actually four times the size as this so
76:10 - I need to be conscientious about this
76:12 - what I actually want to do is take the
76:13 - total number of subscribers and apply
76:15 - the square root to it so that when I
76:18 - when when it's being visualized into a
76:20 - circle it will actually be
76:23 - representative the area of that circle
76:25 - will represent the total number of
76:28 - subscribers okay we can go we can come
76:31 - back over here now all right so here we
76:35 - go this is where I am let me see what
76:36 - was the zoom level when I open it up
76:37 - great so now what I want to do is I
76:40 - should be able to write here say let
76:45 - subscriber I like let's say like sub
76:48 - count equal Roget and I already forgot
76:52 - what's in the CSV file if I quickly look
76:55 - at it here it is just the word
76:57 - subscribers subscribers and I'm going to
77:04 - say let diameter equal the square root
77:09 - of the sub count and I definitely should
77:12 - do some sort of mapping but I'm not
77:14 - going to worry about that right now and
77:15 - then I'm just going to then put diameter
77:18 - here and I'm gonna give this some alpha
77:21 - because I have a feeling I'm gonna have
77:22 - some really big circles and now I'm
77:24 - gonna refresh
77:26 - there we go look at this we have now
77:28 - visualize the subscribers and we can see
77:32 - here this makes sense like there is a
77:33 - lot of subscribers in India and we can
77:39 - look at we can look at Africa we can see
77:42 - that South Africa and Kenya and Nigeria
77:44 - if we look up here in Europe we can kind
77:48 - of see here that Deutschland Germany and
77:55 - England over here we can see the
77:56 - different countries France so this is
77:58 - actually and this should be accurate I
77:59 - could write the number there's so much I
78:01 - could do here visualization wise this
78:02 - really isn't like a tutorial and in the
78:06 - end about you know the visualization I'm
78:09 - really just trying to get the mechanics
78:10 - of it to work and one thing I might want
78:13 - to do I mean that the circles are just
78:15 - so wheat why are they oh they should be
78:18 - sized according to the zoom level Oh
78:21 - weird I'm sorry I'm looking at the chat
78:34 - oh sorry people are in the chatter
78:36 - talking about other stuff um I just
78:38 - realized something
78:39 - the circles are not resizing according
78:43 - to according to the zoom level so how do
78:49 - I do that there's got to be a way in the
78:52 - map a library let's look at let's look
78:56 - at the API so if I go under leaflet we
79:02 - can see look this is actually changing
79:04 - right we can see this example the
79:05 - circles are changing and let's see how
79:07 - that's done map dot zoom so map zoom so
79:14 - this is a way that I can use the zoom
79:16 - level of the map to change the size of
79:19 - the circles so one way I could do that
79:21 - is by saying something like diameter
79:23 - divided divided by train map dot zoom is
79:28 - it just dot zoom oh it's a function dot
79:32 - soon so let's see what happens there
79:36 - where do I go now oops ah where was
79:39 - where was I come back did I lose it
79:43 - oh no I'm over here okay so now Oh No I
79:50 - think I need to multiply it by zoom hold
79:56 - on I have a new sponsor pause for a
80:00 - second no don't let I have to thank the
80:04 - sponsor after thank you
80:06 - it's clx thank you it's C like solo new
80:09 - sponsor I got to get those emojis and
80:12 - icons okay
80:21 - all right if you think about it the zoom
80:24 - level right I come back to my crazy
80:28 - little place over here if you can share
80:30 - with me for a second
80:32 - if I have a circle like this a higher
80:36 - zoom number is me zooming in so I don't
80:40 - want to divide by the zoom level I want
80:43 - to multiply by the zoom level because
80:46 - the size of the circle is going to be
80:49 - what it is at zoom level one if i zoom
80:51 - in by two
80:52 - that circle should grow twice the size
80:54 - so I don't know why I didn't really need
80:56 - to walk over there but mentally I need
80:58 - to take a break okay
81:03 - mentally I just need to take a break
81:04 - here so I so what I need to do is say
81:06 - times zoom and then now look at this
81:10 - it's everything's way too big so now I
81:12 - need to figure out an effective way to
81:14 - to lower everything so one thing I could
81:17 - do is I could find that I probably
81:19 - should just like pre-process the data in
81:20 - setup right there's no reason for me to
81:23 - like do all this parsing over and over
81:25 - again
81:25 - so let me pre-process the data in setup
81:29 - and I'm going to create my own array so
81:34 - I'm gonna say data is just an array I'm
81:46 - gonna say data is an array then I'm
81:49 - gonna go to setup I'm gonna paste in
81:53 - that loop I'm gonna get the country and
81:56 - then here I'm gonna get the pixel oh I
81:59 - don't want the pixel location I just
82:01 - want the lat/long and the sub count so
82:05 - then I'm going to say what am I gonna
82:09 - say here I'm gonna say data dot push I'm
82:14 - just going to make an object now guess
82:18 - what what's that thing called in the new
82:21 - what's that thing called in new
82:24 - JavaScript where you I want to make an
82:25 - object and what I want to do is I want
82:28 - to say lat
82:28 - lat long-long lon
82:33 - sub count sub count this is how I this
82:38 - is how I always have written my code I
82:40 - want to create an object with these
82:42 - properties and the properties have the
82:44 - same name of the variables you don't
82:45 - have to do that anymore JavaScript new
82:47 - fancy JavaScript
82:48 - yes something or other allows me to just
82:50 - do this lat/long sub count and by
82:55 - definition it's going to assume that if
82:59 - I generate an object this way that I
83:01 - want the property name to be the same
83:04 - name I want the property name to be the
83:07 - same name as as the actual variable name
83:11 - itself D structuring I'm being told
83:14 - restructuring I don't know I'm
83:16 - structuring I'm structuring this we we
83:21 - are there two thousand two thousand
83:24 - people watching this right now are there
83:25 - to pause for a second enhanced objects
83:33 - literals it's enhanced object literals
83:36 - this is not going to go
83:38 - [Music]
83:41 - is a thing white very recently in
83:51 - something somebody told me in the slack
83:52 - channel about it and then I should be
83:54 - using it okay apparently it is known as
84:04 - enhanced object literals so this is an I
84:07 - want to create an object literal and I
84:09 - want to create it in an enhanced fashion
84:11 - so now that I have this now that I've
84:13 - done this now I'm gonna do a little
84:14 - thing here I'm gonna say max subs equals
84:20 - 0 and min subs equals 100 infinity now I
84:31 - know I know I did I am using enhanced
84:33 - object literals and I know there's a
84:35 - higher order function sort of fancy way
84:37 - that I could just do this instantly but
84:39 - I'm just going to since I already have
84:41 - this loop anyway I'm just gonna say if
84:44 - sub count is greater than what was it
84:46 - max subs then max subs equals sub count
84:51 - I just want to find what was the largest
84:52 - number of subscribers and I also want to
84:56 - find out what was the minimum number of
84:59 - subscribers so now that I have the
85:03 - minimum and the maximum if I come down
85:06 - here and I can now I can just say for
85:11 - country let country of data and oh oh I
85:18 - want the country ID I need that Oh No
85:21 - look at that I don't I guess I don't
85:23 - need the country idea anymore
85:24 - okay I mean I I want to save the country
85:27 - ID so now I just want to say I don't
85:30 - need this if anymore I don't need this
85:32 - lat long all the parsing has to be done
85:34 - I just want to say now I just want to
85:37 - say country dot lat country dot long and
85:42 - then I don't need to the sub count is
85:46 - right country dot sub count and I want
85:52 - to say that
85:53 - and this should be a constant so should
85:55 - be I'm gonna say the square root of hmm
86:00 - boy I'm having a lot of extra square
86:03 - roots here let me let me actually add
86:05 - let me do this let square let me do
86:13 - square
86:14 - squirt square root I'm gonna just put
86:18 - the diameter in here square I'm gonna to
86:20 - calculate it up here just once and I'm
86:22 - gonna add this in here and then you know
86:30 - what I'm gonna do let's just do all this
86:32 - up here I'm gonna just do this parsing
86:36 - up here too then I'm gonna go through it
86:37 - again one more time yeah yeah I know I
86:39 - could use a higher order function I
86:41 - expect many pull requests and comments
86:43 - about that and I'm gonna say and now I'm
86:46 - going to say let country of data and I'm
86:52 - gonna say country dot diameter equals
86:56 - map the country's diameter between the
87:01 - switch goes between the square root
87:03 - right right right right right I don't
87:05 - want to put the diameter in here I'm
87:08 - gonna add I'm gonna add a new probe
87:10 - there's no reason I'm gonna add this
87:11 - property here and I'm gonna map I'm
87:16 - gonna same in diameter is the square
87:20 - root of the min subscribers and the max
87:26 - let's just say mindy and the max d is
87:31 - the square root of the maximum number of
87:32 - subscribers so now i'm going to map the
87:36 - countries the square root of the
87:40 - country's subscribers which has a range
87:45 - between mindy and max D and I'm going to
87:48 - map that between 10 and 100 and that's
87:53 - the country's diameter so I wanted I
87:55 - want to process I want to just sort of
87:56 - like normalize the data within some
87:58 - range add the diameter property and then
88:01 - right down here I don't need to do any
88:04 - calculations
88:06 - I'm just gonna say pick sex pics why
88:08 - country dot diameter and you know with
88:14 - the ellipse function by the way you
88:15 - don't need to do the width and the
88:16 - height if they're equal and then I'm
88:18 - gonna say train map dot zoom okay I
88:21 - think we might have gotten somewhere
88:23 - here I don't need this anymore and now
88:26 - here we go let's refresh Oh max sub is
88:29 - not defined okay where do I call max
88:32 - subs max subs hmm we're all all of you
88:39 - where are all of you subscribers Oh
88:41 - did everybody unsubscribe all of a
88:43 - sudden because of how long it's taking
88:45 - me to do this and how what a mess this
88:47 - video is okay oh not yet no okay let's
88:52 - do console.log data let's take a look at
88:58 - this let's see what's in that object
89:01 - okay the object is an array with
89:03 - lat/long sub count ooh diameter equals
89:06 - not a number so I messed something up
89:09 - there so let's see oh this has to be
89:16 - outside of here why is that in there Oh
89:18 - so this is something I want to do right
89:21 - before I do this mapping I don't know
89:23 - why I had that in there well you still
89:25 - should have worked
89:26 - let's console.log min subs and Max subs
89:34 - see does that getting a real zero and 98
89:39 - that doesn't seem right more than I have
89:43 - more so max subs a zero min subs is
89:48 - infinity if sub count is greater than
89:52 - max subs hmm that seems weird
90:00 - oh yeah my sizes are probably way too
90:03 - small but hold on
90:06 - those seem like strange numbers to me
90:09 - zero and 98 I have more than nine
90:13 - subscribers
90:14 - okay country dot sub count where did I
90:18 - get that wrong oh yeah
90:22 - but still why is max subs here so so low
90:33 - let's look at this console dot log sub
90:38 - count huh yeah look at this there are
90:44 - some much larger numbers in here do I
90:53 - have that in the wrong place
90:59 - subscribe I know that this is wrong
91:02 - blind 59 yeah I know that this is sub
91:05 - count I see that now but I'm wondering
91:08 - why is this saying 98 right here Oh
91:14 - square root no no no but a console blog
91:17 - did here did my square rooting it's
91:20 - somewhere else
91:20 - oh I square it no no no this is
91:22 - unnecessary look at this one more time
91:27 - hold on why why why all right I have
91:34 - let's look at this console look sub
91:37 - count max subs
91:42 - welcome to watching somebody not able to
91:45 - figure out a problem debugging debugging
91:48 - 9898
91:50 - look at this are they string somehow
91:54 - because oh they must their strings
91:59 - they're not numbers look at this if
92:03 - they're strings in alphabetical order 9
92:06 - 8 is greater than 9 79 I was not being
92:10 - careful the value that I'm getting out
92:13 - of the table is not a number I need to
92:16 - convert it to a number it's by default
92:19 - and I think probably I might have been
92:21 - I'll say something like get number in
92:23 - with the p5 API or I'm not sure let's
92:26 - see get number is that part of p5 no but
92:31 - I could say get and then convert it
92:33 - write a CSV everything is by default
92:36 - text and these should probably I don't
92:40 - know why these sort of worked somehow oh
92:42 - because it came in as an array and
92:46 - somehow oh no because I I'm pulling it
92:50 - I'm that's coming from the JSON file and
92:53 - they are numbers in the JSON file the
92:54 - CSV it was only text so now there we go
92:58 - that's the maximum number of subscribers
93:01 - that makes sense I can get rid of this I
93:05 - have I should see right there we go so
93:09 - now if i zoom in
93:13 - the sizes aren't changing right the size
93:18 - no but I want it to change oh did I not
93:24 - put that in you know I'm multiplying by
93:28 - zoom so let's let's see something here
93:35 - yeah what did I get wrong yep
93:45 - console dot log train map zoom let's
93:49 - make sure I got this right the zoom is
93:55 - to zoom is 3
94:08 - flip min subs and Max subs know they
94:20 - right but I want them to be a fixed so I
94:25 - think it's doing what it's supposed to
94:27 - do
94:29 - right cuz the more it is working but
94:31 - that's not what I wanted to do I want it
94:34 - to be the same size they don't want to
94:40 - be 0 right I want this to be much much
94:42 - smaller now so I did want it to divide
94:44 - by the zoom I just need to make them
94:47 - much bigger then let me so in other
94:55 - words hold on is the zoom linear oh wait
95:03 - let me think about this it's nonlinear
95:07 - that's the problem that's the problem
95:16 - multiplying is correct it's nonlinear so
95:20 - long
95:30 - so what did what did Chris do in the
95:36 - example plus my map zoom huh that's
95:46 - interesting
95:47 - I mean that's one way so is it is it
95:57 - just squared yeah is it just squared
96:19 - yeah
96:22 - No
96:45 - oh yeah I just needed to do the same
96:49 - thing square root right that's now doing
96:51 - what I expected all right look at this
96:54 - look at how that circle is over the
96:56 - United States no no I mean it's sort of
97:02 - an interesting so what is the formula
97:10 - leaflet
97:12 - why is everything more complicated than
97:14 - a nice zoom is probably working as a
97:20 - more complex object which you build
97:22 - using those integers yeah yeah power to
97:33 - to the zoom oh oh well that's
97:36 - interesting it's some silly Google ratio
97:39 - yeah I think there's a standard I've
97:40 - read about this before I've encountered
97:42 - this before zoom a Google Maps API zoom
97:48 - what's the right zoom level range
98:02 - yeah there's some Mercator projection so
98:07 - the scale varies substantially with
98:09 - latitude a formula for correct is based
98:12 - on latitude is to this Wow
98:15 - oh but maybe if it's
98:30 - yeah log scale makes sense log base 2 I
98:37 - think that's part let's look at the mapa
98:39 - API no so there isn't a isn't
98:59 - necessarily a so this would be an
99:05 - interesting to add to Napa power to to
99:09 - the divided by power 2 to the zoom or
99:12 - cater let's see hold on
99:42 - no multiply I probably have to go ahead
99:46 - and use that
99:49 - everything's way too big now
100:03 - [Music]
100:13 - oh yeah this looks right right I mean
100:20 - I'm not sure that that yeah I think this
100:24 - is right now yeah I mean it might be
100:31 - slightly off to to the zoom okay great
100:35 - right I got first where did I leave off
100:46 - let's just go - yeah here let's go back
100:51 - to here
100:55 - okay so interestingly enough this is not
100:58 - a surprise here but this is not a linear
101:00 - relationship as i zoom in from 1 to 2 or
101:04 - 2 to 4 I'm not actually just doubling
101:08 - the size so formula that I can actually
101:11 - use it has to do with the way the zoom
101:15 - that that the way that I'm learning a
101:32 - lot from doing this video it turns out
101:35 - and this shouldn't have been a surprise
101:36 - to me I have encountered this before I
101:38 - think that it's not a linear
101:40 - relationship when I zoomed from 1 to 2
101:42 - or 2 to 4 I'm not just doubling the size
101:46 - in fact so multiplying by the zoom isn't
101:50 - really getting me a consistent size
101:52 - circle as I'm moving and zooming around
101:54 - so what I really actually want to do is
101:56 - not multiplied by the zoom value and I
101:58 - think I'm just going to be a little
101:59 - easier to see if I say constant zoom
102:01 - equals so just put it in a variable
102:03 - train map zoom and what I want to do is
102:07 - the scale the scale I'm just going to
102:11 - say SC l because there's a function in
102:13 - p5 called scale is 2 to the zoom power
102:17 - now this I don't know if this is a
102:19 - hundred percent exactly right but so I'd
102:23 - have to maybe do some research on this
102:24 - and maybe someone
102:25 - the comments can give me some help here
102:26 - if I'm if I'm getting this right but let
102:28 - me just put this in now scale now now
102:32 - the problem is now I'm multiplying by a
102:33 - very large number so this is kind of
102:35 - looks a little bit out of control so let
102:37 - me go back to my values up here where I
102:41 - was doing this mapping and I'm actually
102:42 - gonna have I'm gonna map between 2 and
102:45 - 10 so the minimum number of subtractions
102:48 - go between 1 pixel and 10 pixels so now
102:51 - if i refresh here we can move around and
102:54 - we can see like look at this you can see
102:56 - here if i zoom in on Brazil you can sort
103:00 - of see look look at the size of this
103:02 - circle right and then we keep zooming in
103:04 - it's kind of staying the same size
103:06 - relative to the country so this is the
103:08 - effect that I wanted and again me being
103:10 - off by a slight amount and now I could
103:12 - potentially say like okay well actually
103:14 - I'm happy to go I mean all the way up to
103:15 - 5050 and we can kind of see here maybe
103:19 - this helps a little bit but now
103:20 - everything's kind of on top of
103:22 - everything else so I liked it maybe let
103:23 - me go back to 20 you know anyway so the
103:27 - point is this isn't necessarily the best
103:29 - way to visualize this data maybe what I
103:31 - actually want to do is visualize
103:33 - something about the number of
103:35 - subscribers per like relative to
103:37 - population or maybe what I actually want
103:38 - to do is get the sort of geo JSON data
103:41 - which is like an outline of all the
103:42 - countries to fill them in but I at least
103:44 - have done this and guess what just as a
103:49 - quick little extra thing to add to the
103:52 - end of this video and by the way look at
103:55 - all these subscribers down here in the
103:58 - Virgin Islands is that where I'm looking
104:00 - at the wrong plates that's kind of
104:07 - amazing to me I'm gonna swap out my CSV
104:12 - file let's quickly look at the watch
104:14 - time file the watch time also has
104:18 - country ID and watch time in minutes now
104:22 - the nice thing is the nice thing is I
104:26 - already built in all this stuff to kind
104:28 - of normalize the data between the
104:30 - minimum and maximum I could also look at
104:32 - views maybe I should look at views watch
104:34 - time probably makes more sense so I
104:35 - could really briefly right here
104:38 - change this out and I probably should
104:41 - have just called this I'm going to call
104:42 - this instead of subscriber data I'm
104:45 - gonna just do a find and replace
104:46 - subscriber data with like YouTube data
104:49 - replace all and I'm now going to swap
104:54 - this out and say watch time Gio I'm
104:58 - gonna comment this out and the only
105:00 - thing I need to change is I also want to
105:02 - get here now instead of subscribers I
105:06 - want what was it called again a watch
105:09 - underscore time underscore minutes watch
105:12 - underscore time underscore minutes also
105:16 - by the way had one in sub count I should
105:19 - change also which was views let me just
105:22 - change this everywhere it's a sub count
105:24 - let me just change this to count just to
105:30 - be more generic about it and let's make
105:32 - sure the okay and so where it where am I
105:38 - here sorry views let's see if this works
105:39 - with views there we go so now we're
105:43 - looking at this map based on views and
105:46 - now let's look at watch time and I can
105:51 - go to switch it out just by commenting
105:54 - it to watch time minutes oh look the
105:58 - same be interesting to see what's the
106:00 - relative difference these are like watch
106:01 - time per subscriber that's something I
106:03 - could visualize here I'm sure that many
106:06 - of you watching this could come up with
106:08 - a much more stylish or perhaps more
106:09 - effective way of communicating this so
106:11 - here's the thing I will publish these
106:14 - data files along with the source code
106:16 - for this particular video I would love
106:18 - to see you maybe we can have some
106:19 - rainbow themed train themed
106:22 - visualizations and try it with other try
106:27 - it with other mapping api's try thinking
106:30 - about it in different ways how can you
106:32 - communicate this data better than I have
106:34 - and I hope you will share that with me
106:37 - so thanks for tolerating this video
106:39 - which is very very long where I
106:41 - struggled with a lot of aspects but to
106:43 - me this is a really exciting that I can
106:45 - have a tiled map that I can zoom in
106:47 - and interactively move around as well as
106:50 - draw on top so by the way these can all
106:52 - be animations this is the other thing
106:54 - like so I've done nothing visually or
106:56 - interesting here really or I'm not
106:58 - animating anything and that's the other
106:59 - thing you should really think about
107:00 - right so just to like quickly make that
107:03 - if I say like frame count module is 255
107:08 - and you know the the scale the size the
107:12 - is the scale is also times you know sign
107:16 - a frame count times 0.01 or something
107:22 - right I'm just gonna add some weird
107:23 - stuff to animate it right you could see
107:26 - that these are now hold on let me have
107:29 - that animate a little faster 0.1 you can
107:34 - see that they're blinking right and that
107:36 - blinking is going to stay consistent as
107:38 - I move around the map and the color is
107:41 - changing so this is the other thing you
107:43 - could do you can animate this stuff so
107:48 - what can you do with this data what can
107:50 - you do with your own data what can you
107:52 - do with maps that look like this with
107:54 - other maps think about the projection
107:56 - that you're using research about
107:57 - different mapping projections in
107:58 - different ways of showing maps and make
108:00 - something share with me in the comments
108:02 - share with me at Schiffman on twitter
108:04 - and also look for the link in the
108:06 - video's description to the coding trade
108:08 - comm page where you can submit a
108:10 - contribution a link out to one of your
108:12 - contributions as well okay thanks for
108:13 - watching this and thanks for subscribing
108:16 - I mean maybe you didn't subscribe it's
108:17 - just fine you don't have to subscribe
108:18 - but for those of y'all subscribed thank
108:20 - you thank you for watching thank you for
108:21 - everything it's an honor and a privilege
108:24 - for me to get to make these video
108:25 - tutorials and have and reach people all
108:28 - over the world and let's just have a
108:30 - look one more time and all of you all
108:32 - over the world there you are all of you
108:35 - all over the world thank you
108:41 - okay I got through that is that is that
108:49 - really very fun to like dev DeMarcos
108:59 - Rosa wants to see wants to see my city
109:02 - where's your city Canadia I don't think
109:06 - it's called Canadia
109:07 - where's Canada so this is Canada here
109:10 - all right I'm gonna take off that so one
109:13 - that that this crazy stuff
109:18 - and I'll leave the color cycling because
109:24 - I think that's useful for I mean just to
109:32 - sort of make the point okay
109:37 - Thank You Sammy Hoss whoo all right
109:43 - I've really got to go this did not
109:47 - happen in the one hour I'd planned for
109:51 - everything always takes me longer
109:53 - everything is always harder than you
109:54 - think that's the way of coding maybe for
109:58 - you you just breeze through everything
109:59 - but I don't think so I think you're
110:01 - probably more like me you get tripped up
110:03 - everywhere it's always embarrassing and
110:07 - I hope you enjoyed this live stream
110:10 - could you make it that we can see where
110:12 - the viewers of this live stream are so
110:14 - in theory that's possible but I'd have
110:17 - to probably use the YouTube API for that
110:18 - I could try to research that and see but
110:22 - I've got to go it's almost six o'clock
110:25 - and barber shops that's gonna go with
110:29 - definitely closed so I don't know I
110:33 - guess this is me this is what you're
110:35 - stuck with I I should read some random
110:38 - numbers for the 500th livestream not the
110:43 - five livestream them for whatever I'm
110:45 - gonna go to page 500 there isn't a page
110:48 - 500 the random numbers only
110:51 - 400 is their page 500 for the I guess I
110:57 - could read 500 random numbers let's just
111:00 - do 50 I don't know what to do Oh 500
111:05 - plus 100 400 plus 100 is 500 so I just
111:14 - need to go to 100 here we go one point
111:20 - four eight four negative one point five
111:23 - one seven point seven four zero point
111:28 - seven eight five point four seven seven
111:31 - one point one zero nine negative
111:34 - negative one point one zero nine 10.27
111:37 - two negative negative point nine four
111:40 - six negative two point two eight eight
111:44 - crud that's the closest time you get to
111:47 - swearing I think I for once 0.163 one
111:59 - point two eight one negative one point
112:02 - nine two three zero point six six one
112:05 - zero point two one five two point three
112:09 - seven three one point six eight six one
112:12 - point four nine three all right
112:17 - everybody
112:19 - so Cal amok in the chat is asking how
112:22 - can you add country ID in numbers into
112:23 - those bubbles so I could use the text
112:25 - function I could use a Dom element but
112:28 - just really quickly just to see like if
112:31 - I were to say fill I know I the way I
112:33 - didn't keep the country ID here so I
112:36 - would need to add it to this but I could
112:38 - use the text function so I'd love to see
112:40 - people do that the ukelele alright
112:45 - the can't I can't resist let's do some
112:50 - random number ukulele
112:59 - you see I want you to be able to see
113:01 - that this is the book well it's never
113:05 - gonna prop up I'm gonna make this work
113:14 - somehow Stan Stan book every but now you
113:22 - can all understand how I broke my elbow
113:24 - so easily last summer okay there we go
113:26 - there we go can you read that that's a
113:30 - million random digits I guess so but we
113:35 - should probably put this here sixty-six
113:44 - thousand six hundred
113:48 - [Music]
115:11 - no that's not the right cord oh whatever
115:17 - look I only started trying to learn to
115:21 - play the ukulele three weeks ago so cut
115:23 - me some slack thank you thank you
115:29 - all right everybody thank you for
115:32 - subscribing to this channel please stay
115:34 - in touch
115:35 - I releasing a lot of video content all
115:38 - the edited versions of all this live
115:40 - stream nonsense I won't look at any of
115:41 - that over the next few weeks I might you
115:44 - might not see me with a new live stream
115:46 - until July so but I will be back and
115:49 - we'll be back to finish those tensorflow
115:52 - j/s color classifier I will try to do a
115:55 - convolutional neural network with Tessa
115:57 - flowy has to do an image classifier I
115:59 - think that's that's the gonna be the end
116:01 - of what I want to do with tensorflow
116:02 - jest and then I'm going to move to the
116:05 - ml 5 library which is just a late on top
116:08 - attention flow Genesis nobodies I'll
116:09 - still be using that so May oh yes random
116:15 - music Jenner all sorts of things must
116:16 - come eventually but it just takes a long
116:19 - time to code stuff it's a little time
116:23 - all right everybody will this live
116:26 - stream yes this live stream will be
116:27 - available the instant I press stop after
116:31 - URL that you are currently watching it
116:33 - does go to unlisted and then I will make
116:35 - it listed once much' who helps me manage
116:39 - the channel has a chance to like put a
116:41 - description and time codes and things
116:42 - like that ok everybody
116:45 - have a wonderful week I will definitely
116:48 - not be back any day this week if things
116:52 - the stars align I will be back sometime
116:54 - next week
116:55 - or sometime in July but I will be on the
116:58 - internet so you can find me on Twitter
116:59 - and you you I always read all the
117:02 - comments I really do read all the
117:04 - comments on the channel and I just thank
117:08 - you this has been this this has been a
117:10 - really surprising thing that's happened
117:12 - to me in the last few years I mean I
117:16 - think that I did I first I'm pretty sure
117:21 - that I didn't I
117:22 - I don't I think I uploaded the first
117:25 - hold on let's go I uploaded the first
117:28 - video tutorial to YouTube I haven't been
117:31 - making them on Vimeo for quite a while
117:32 - in the fall of 2015 and then and then if
117:41 - I go to like the livestream playlist I
117:44 - don't know if that's on here I where I
117:49 - go to playlists unlisted live streams oh
118:02 - boy what's in their live stream live
118:12 - stream I could really use some where are
118:17 - the live
118:20 - do I have to like oh I have to keep like
118:23 - scrolling down this is insane there we
118:30 - go live stream archives this is July
118:36 - 29th 2013 oh yeah this is I attempted to
118:40 - do a live stream on July 29th 2013 which
118:44 - it's definitely is my birthday that's
118:46 - kind of interesting July 29 look there's
118:48 - sean vann every this is a test using
118:50 - Google Hangouts but then this is the
118:54 - real first live stream with the system I
118:57 - have now which was September 4th 2015 so
119:00 - it has been I can't do this math almost
119:03 - three years and so thank you you can
119:07 - watch all these live streams good night
119:10 - everybody have a wonderful evening
119:11 - morning night sleep all those sorts of
119:14 - things
119:14 - enjoy some fresh air give a hug to a
119:16 - friend do something good in the world if
119:18 - you can be kind and I will see you next
119:22 - time
119:26 - let's find something we wanna make some
119:29 - crazy idea we'll figure out what it
119:32 - takes to make that dream understand

Cleaned transcript:

primary stream we're not receiving video day not fast enough rate your viewers may experience buffering sure your connection is fast enough or consider lowering a bit rate can you hear me can you see me this big giant red word is on my live streaming page that says bad bad bad your bad oh good good good I'm here with you all right here we are welcome I would say that this is a special Monday coding train surprise visit but it's not really because I mentioned I was gonna be here on Monday and I actually to be honest with you I was planning to cancel the livestream today and then somehow overnight the channel hit 500,000 subscribers which is a much larger number than I imagined could be possible with this nonsense that I'm doing until I thought I should do something to celebrate that I have I have some I have to say though however and I'm just opening up the chat over here that I see and I see the YouTube chat I have to say that I'm you're not gonna see me for a little while after today although I have a lot of content edited content that is yet to be released so there will be new videos coming out on the channel over the next two weeks but I am going out of town for a couple days then I am moving I have not moved in ten years when I'm moving from a apartment to another apartment so that's taking up a lot of my mental time and energy then I'm going away on another trip and I won't be back in New York until July 12th so after today I'm gonna be gone for like three weeks possibly if if if a miracle happens I'll be back next week for like one live stream next week so I am gonna be in town and have moved for a couple days but so I just wanted to put that out there I will I will say though ever that I am planning to go to the barber shop to deal with this because this this can't this can't be going any longer so now oh this is not on let's see if I can turn this camera on now this is what I had been doing previously last week I had been working on a example using tensorflow J s to make a classification project or I'm classifying RGB inputs that are RGB colors three inputs and returning one of nine possible labels that say something about the color like bluish reddish brownish etc and so I'm trying to show the whole machine learning process from collecting data cleaning data training a model and then predicting with new data and that model testing the model so I'm about maybe a third or half way through that and that's the thing that I probably should continue although but I'm gonna take a break from that I only have about an hour and I'm going to try to do something to celebrate 500,000 subscribers but before I get to that I have one more thing to say which is that a project that I have been working on but that I really cannot kind of barely take any credit for whatsoever is this project called ml5 and so when I'm back in July I'm hoping to do a lot of tutorials with this machine learning library which is built on top of tensorflow Jas so if you want to learn more about ml 5 let me give you some links go to ml 5ks org I would also recommend you go to ITP dot NYU edu slash adjacent now adjacent come on ITP at NYU dot edu you can do it you can node adjacent is an online journal from ITP which is the program here at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts where I work and there are actually articles by Lauren McCarthy Adi Melanie C ah knows that COBOL Rupa Dominick Michael Allison Parrish so I encourage you to read all of all of this that interest you in this journal in if you're interested in ml5 you should read everything else but five article I think but if you want to know a little bit more about the background of ml5 like click on this this is the article I put together describing all the people who have worked on the projects and their contributions so you can scroll through here to find out about the history of the project different artists who have visited ITP and contributed there are some interactive demos like this one look that's me and I'm broccoli oh we hit allow oh I can't look oh whoa oh this one I'm still broccoli all right let's move on I think we need to fix that one I'm going to generate some text I'm going to run style transfer I'm gonna kill this computer I did it too many times let's see if this one works this is gonna be great oh yeah see remember how I said I was going to do a ukulele tuner hit the right pitch D so this is a great Hannah Davis put this together it's using a model pretrained model known as CREP clipclip and it detects pitch quite accurately and the goal of this game is to try to sing the correct note F sharp all right so that's one demo and we keep going down here see what else is here we have a word to Veck model pizza is to humans as fish is to birds and we have pose net let's see if this one works which was ported the tensorflow J s by Dan Ovid so I'm gonna do tutorials using all of these things all week this week but I've I guess I'm gonna come back in July and be doing these some information about data and responsible data practices scrolling through here thank you to Google Creative Lab and the Google brain team and the pair initiative and the big picture research group many different groups that Google's supported this project and there are links down at the bottom for where you can find more information oh new sponsor welcome new sponsor Divya Khanna thank you for the sponsorship Wow alright so that's what I want to make that announcement about ml5 and let me be clear that while this is a project that I did work on I am one small tiny piece of many many people who contributed to this we can see a list of many of their names here oh I also if we go to twitter.com slash ml 5 j s this is the ml 5 Twitter account and if I go to Twitter / Schiffman all there's gonna be all sorts of nonsense there I got to see if I can find well what is that oh my god this is me waiting there's like ads here I don't get ads when I and I'm just trying to find the thread oh this is really lame with me this is the thread in Reverse but here we go this particular thread is a thread where I attempt to just quickly describe all the people who have worked on in project and I there are more people than I'm describing here if you go to the github and if you're someone who's contributed I'm alive and I'm not crediting you properly please get in touch with me because it's my goal really important to be generous with thanks and credits in this world of opensource and creative coding and education that I live in all right oh yes another new sponsor damiano's the Nardo so now I'm gonna get to the 500,000 coding challenge and let me get myself set up for that so what I need to do on fluent some music here okay I've got to warm the body up and hope it's Izzie there okay I'm gonna look on github.com let's look for mapa that's not let's look for a map I'm looking for it so I need this URL there's a documentation website as well let's go to here perfect let's go to the desktop and p5 G B subscriber or YouTube this all right subscribe our subscriber so I've got some CSV files here then I'm going to use for the data you'll need this folder all right everyone all right so let me cycle these cameras so I'm gonna tend to do something very simple here and I'm getting a great suggestion from the chat burgerbob rights as a 500,000 special try using new things like visual studio code or live server all right I've got got motivation for all of you watching let's see if we can get to a million subscribers in the next 10 minutes and if that happens I'll switch to visual studio code I mean how about how much longer Adams even gonna be around shouldn't I get to enjoy it while it's still here I love my Adam editor it's just so comfortable for me all right so I'm thinking of using the I'm thinking of using the leaflet API so I think I've enough to say all this again but matthijs is a project oh there's another medium processing or map I'll see if I can get this here we go map attach a s is a project that was a google Summer of Code project from last summer 2017 it really had intended to do some tutorials with it back in the fall but somehow I didn't get around to it and this is an article describing it apparently my name is here whose article for some reason but Cristobal Valenzuela is the creator of the map a library and what it does and this is oh this is a wonderful example when Ben fries original projects called zip decode which is part of his book visualizing data and so this is a project this library allows you to interface with another napping API like Google Maps or leaflet or if we go back to the examples map box and basically embed a map from one of these other libraries into your webpage put a canvas on top of it and it gives you functionality to as you move around and zoom through the map you can redraw whatever you're drawing on top of it and resize it according to how you're moving around of zooming in the map so this is where this functionality is stuff that I'm going to be using this library for it's doing really all of the heavy lifting and so I think I'll start with leaflet because it doesn't require an API key but and look I can play just copypaste this example basically gonna do exactly this example but I'm gonna I'm not gonna copy/paste this example I'm going to try to write it in my own way and look at this and there's some tutorials here introduction to web Maps oh this is amazing look at all this wonderful documentation and examples and projections and this sort of thing also much wonderful information here so what was I saying I sort of looking at the chat this is what happens to me all the time and I should just have a rule there's actually a big there's a piece of paper here a little special treat for all of you on the wall back here behind the camera there's a piece of paper taped to the wall and this is what it says on it look here as I try to remember to look at you my friends my my I haven't seen that mr. Rogers documentary yet but I hear it's amazing and I wanted to say my neighbors there for a second but I don't think that's okay guy okay so look here hello so what I what I have is the data let me put the data in here actually so let me open up Adam I have to oh boy oh maybe I can preview this so I have a subscribers I have I have subscribers by country and I also have I also have I believe watch time the amount of minutes watched by country interestingly enough and this is for all time this is since the channel was started so this probably doesn't accurately reflect say the the countries in the last 30 days but and we can see here United States is at the top that's like it's not a surprise given that to the country where I am Germany where's Mexico come on Mexico that's right go Mexico alright I'll be Germany I like you do great for Mexico so what was I saying use that data for machine learning okay so I think I just gotta get started with this I should have practiced this right so here here just want to see leaflet basic example just saying like what's a good oh this is also such a great reference maybe I can make this doesn't I don't want to put even though it's they here on the internet I prefer not to put somebody's email address on it so right now live streaming okay I guess I don't need to reference to this page I'll just reference that it's down here and then taxi routes Torrio's simple map yeah I guess we could follow this tutorial you see this ah yep all right this tutorial is what I'm going to follow perfect there's a tutorial written for me to do the coding challenge Denmark there's definitely a lot of people from Denmark alright we are going to get started our live streams included in the data yes well okay so just to be clear and I guess I should say this during the I mean this is the I have this weird thing that I do where I like ramble and then I start but it's all me just talking but the question was asked by Medan are live streams included in the data so what I've done to get this data is I've logged into my creator studio on YouTube and I've done the export to CSV so I'm entirely relying on insta microphone it's all sort of off I'm entirely relying on what YouTube is giving me and so and I'm not doing this with the YouTube API which would be interesting to do but yeah okay alright here we go let's get a moveon what's a good let's start with here or here or here or here this is good okay the mic is the mic okay I I could put on the hoodie and then attaches to the hoodie a little bit better but it's do there's like this like heatwave crazy we wave in New York City sound is fine picture is fine what time is it now 423 all right we're doing well the mic shakes a bit when you were dancing and knocks against your body all right let me switch let me switch to this let's try this and see if this is a little bit more stable I like Austin to the chat rightz as long as you're not moving around like crazy the mic is fine well I have got news for you have you watch this YouTube channel before let's see how this goes oh this is my 2017 camera all right this makes it much more stable I don't know what happened to my shirt oh it's because it's under hold on hold on everybody just bear with me this is very professional it's a very professional livestream thing here going hightech professional operation I've got going on here teams of producers video camera operators and script writers and just a sea of people out here tell you what to do with my ears secret messages okay I think this is gonna be better now plus I can do this all right how's that better everybody Kotick trade brought to you by mysterious liquid inside a cup usually I attempt to use my clean canteen not an official sponsor because it's better than throwing away these paper cups but today that's what I have all right try moving around okay so Alka says I need to try moving around like crazy Oh Thank You Dennis for the super chat is the mic okay now what's this I can't do it the pickles okay alright let's I think I gotta get started here I am NOT please be so annoying we're not gonna include that hello I'm making a video coding challenge today to celebrate some large subscribers which is kind of insane and then right after this I'm going to go to the barbershop so please I beware I really let this go here I'm gonna deal with it alright what am I going to do today I'm going to celebrate the subscribers the viewers of the coding train with a visualization and I'm going to use a pretend library that I've been meaning to use for quite a while called mapa j s it was a google Summer of Code project last summer 2017 with the processing foundation created by Cristobal Valenzuela so there if you go to the Napa j/s org website there's a ton of tutorials introduction to web Maps a history of different projections so much interesting good stuff here I also if you scroll down here and really recommend taking a look at Mimi Onew OHA's everything is spatial data and digital mapping work so I love to get into all this but I'm just gonna try to do something really basic I have on my computer if I could find it why didn't I get organized before I started this YouTube here we go I have some CSV files these CSV files I downloaded through the creator studio so I logged in with my account in the Creator studio I went to the analytics and there's an export to CSV so presumably there is some way for me to get this data with the YouTube API and I would encourage you hopefully I'm hoping people will make stuff either with their own YouTube channels or I think it's okay for me to publish this data there's no user information in it so I will check but I'll probably I'll I will also publish this data as well people want to revisit and interesting ways for me or not for me for you but anyway whatever you get the point is this is going very well why have you subscribed to this channel tutorial things for you to watch out there when I was what I was going to show you is I have all of subscribers by country and I have also all of I have watched I'm by country this is the watch time in minutes apparently people have watched a candy I can't even read that that number it's 41 million 100 in the US some 41 million minutes that's really it's really weird I mean wasn't just one person I hope it's gonna this is a mapping visualization tutorial isn't it okay let's go okay so how what I'm going to do here well first so I'm going to come back to mapa the github for mapa is here by the way that all these URLs will be in the video's description if you're still watching or you just left and reading the description however watching some other machine learning tutorial but I'm gonna I'm gonna use this I'm is going to follow this tutorial by Chris called simple now mapa is an interface to other mapping API is like Google Maps map box leaflet and maybe I'm missing MapQuest Welbeck quest still exists that's amazing I'm saying look Map Quest so I'm gonna use leaflet just because from you don't need an API key for leaflet so it makes it a little easier for me to just roll on in and make this project but I encourage you to try this with Google Maps or map box yourself ok bye well let's get started here so the first thing I don't want to do actually it's nothing to do with mapping I want to say function preload because I want to load in all the data so I want to say just celebrate I'm gonna use Const Const is a way of declaring a variable that you're not allowed to that you're saying I'm never going to reassign this variable to a new value there's some nuance to that but that's the basic idea so I'm gonna preach really a means to protect myself here so I'm gonna say Const subscriber subscriber data then in preload I'm gonna say I can't spell subscriber subscriber data equals load table whew now low table is a function inside of p5 as part of peek the p5 chess library that is specially suited for loading CSV data tabular data some other videos where I use that and describe that in more detail so I want to just let's start with subscribers underscore geo subscribers underscore geo dot CSV then I just want to in setup then say console dot log subscriber data so let's first make sure I can actually load the CSV in the first place and I'm gonna go over here hit refresh missing initializer in constellation oh okay well I can't use Const here this is such a failure already so I can't use Const why because this is me reassigning hit kinda sign it up there that's of use let some other day I'll find the perfect I mean you just can't somewhere else in this you'll see it's constant it's very hard to say all right so now we're loading hmm it's still loading this really is not going very well I don't think it's taking all this time to load I think that I have a mistake load table subscribers geode now let me just see here what version I mean the recent version of p5 there there was at some point an issue with using load table in preload I thought that had been ironed out by now let me make a let me just make let's do a little test here well this by the way this videos gonna have lots of extra stuff in it I'm just letting this go no editing no editing I'm gonna make a test dot CSV file so you know it's like an hour or 500 minutes that would be appropriate all right so abc123 so I'm just gonna make a test this is how I like to debug things and I make a test CSV file just try loading that oh I saw something there for a second look it's like they're pre load setup hmm hold on what is going on what what craziness let's see here subscribe or data it's there check the network tab so is this a bug in p5 let's take a look at the p5 github ok let's look for take that back load table I would look under issues cannot no let's try to look the load table preload this looks like it was fixed though this looks familiar to me oh my god I am just doomed to repeat the same videos over and over again I made an earthquake visualize it's visualizer and I think probably I ran into this issue then as well yeah all right all right all right we're gonna let's go back to this what is going on let's put in a draw function and see if that helps anything restart the browser yeah let's just switch to X or because i every every few weeks i redo solving xor with some machine learning technique all right I don't think restarting the browser is gonna do anything here but it's not a bad point whoops okay all right there's a guy there's going to be an edit point here oh it's just being like incredibly slow alko was saying check the network tab why is it being so slow yeah it's just slow so can anyone explain this to me this is going to be an edit queen that's why I made a test file like why did it take 11 seconds to load that file no but I switched to using test dot CSV which is a tiny file and these aren't even that big 12 bytes why did it take a look that's like one second per byte why is it doing that restart the server that's a good idea oh maybe the server is like horrible at this No all right let's try there we go all right so weird weird the Python server was like all right so I'm just gonna go back all right so I had we had to we had to edit there there's no way around it I learned something new so in the browser there's this in the console in the in the developer tools there's this thing called network and I'm gonna hit refresh right now and oops sorry I'm gonna put it at localhost 8080 I'm waiting waiting for it to load the file is only 12 bytes this this was just meant to be a demonstration well I was fine with 11 seconds that would be like a demonstration all right I'm going to demonstrate this a different way okay all right I had to edit this there there was no way around editing it there I did however I think I have a path to move forward and I've learned something new inside the developer tools I usually just look at this console thing there is this tab called Network and what we can see here look at this the test dot CSV file is just pending pending it's never load ago it finally loaded it took uh I can't I want to be able to see it took 26 seconds 26 seconds to load that file that file test dot CSV is exactly 12 bytes meaning that's like two seconds per bytes this is very byte very unreasonable so I don't know what's going on but I I don't want to blame anybody nobody's fault things just work if they work sometimes but I'm getting some weird behavior with this Python server that I'm using and actually if I change and use I have a node server HTTP server also available on my computer so I'm gonna run that be a terminal HTTP server and then I'm gonna go back over here oh wait no have to go to a different yes different port and look at this three milliseconds test CSV so now we can go back we're getting somewhere we're getting somewhere I can go back to subscribers underscore geo dot CSV there we go okay now we've got that file I'm gonna go back to the console I'm gonna look at subscriber data and I can see there we go I've got an array with a 237 rows that means there's 237 oh there's fifty three columns there's lots of extra data in there other and there's two hundred thirty seven rows now one thing is all the cop none of the columns have a name so one of the things I want to do is p5 if I give it this nice little second argument and say header I think that says the first row in the CSV file is the header and we can see that if I click on here you can see these are all the headers that are actually there in that first row so now let me go back and refresh I'm gonna look at the subscriber data again go look at here we could see ah there it is so country name country ID and subscribers and then there's other all sorts of other columns transactions and ad revenue and all sorts of stuff so I'm probably going to clean up this data when I publish this just to have only the first three columns country name country ID and subscribers that's all that I'm gonna use for this example so now what's next I need a way of iterating over every single one of those so let's just look at how I might do that I don't know how but for let I equals 0 I is less than subscriber data dot I don't know total columns let's look at the API p5.js org let's look at the reference I'm gonna look for p5 table and I guess if I go here to p5 table we're gonna see add row remove row get rogue find row find Rose match row I'm looking for total uhhuh Oh columns rows looking for Rose it's just in a field subscriber data dot rows I plus plus then I'm going to say the row is subscriber data get row I and let me just look at the rows go back here let's look at I haven't done this in a while line 10 Oh Rose it's an array of all the rows that's even more convenient so let row it's not a number I thought it was a total of subscriber data row I can use a for of loop and now I can just look at each row one at a time there we go that's each row one at a time then I can say console log row get column what were the columns again country let's look country oh it's sort of like atom just knows it's not a country ID and let's do this ooh get column is not oh maybe it's just get yes there we go get it's just get and I get the country ID now I want to get a console log row get what was it called subscribers okay awesome there we go so I now have a country ID followed by subscribers country ID followed by subscribers okay we're getting somewhere should probably find the minimum and the maximum and normalize things but we'll worry about that later okay now now let's go back to the mapping tutorial what's been like two hours since I started this I'm gonna go back to this simple map example and first of all I need to include a reference to this map map a library in my HTML file so I'm gonna just copy paste this here and I'm gonna go to index dot HTML and one of these days I'll learn how all this fancy new module stuff works but there's no way I like to do it right now when a reference that library let's go back to the tutorial Oh welcome to reading through a tutorial and copying the code over to your code code but thank you to this excellent documentation for the map library so I want to create a look at this there we go Const let's create a new map instance so I want to make a new back pulling from the leaflet API just to be clear leaflet is this a jaw opensource JavaScript library for mobilefriendly interactive maps so again you can use leaflet directly by just going right there and looking at how the code works mapa provides a layer on top of that also because it you can pick other things besides leaflet as well as it integrates nicely with p5 and probably other JavaScript libraries alright so now let's just refresh let's make sure things are still working things are some ooh there was an error at the top there ref because it's mime type is X not executable what did I do wrong here hmm we have a little bit of an issue strange why did map oh let me just take what's going on here why did I get that error message let me take out this console.log Oh Oh No okay doesn't seem to mind it with the p5 libraries hold on there's no added weight nobody no one's telling me anything what's going on here let's look at this Oh interesting so I think it's broken I don't know if Chris is watching yeah so this let's see hold on now let's look at NP oh look at this point five I got point zero zero four let's look at NPM I mean NPM mapa this is the same exact link I mean I could just download the library whoops yeah weird so I'm just I don't know why 0 0.5 is not working I assume everything will work fine and 0 0.4 I hope that's not going to trip me up but let's file a github issue oh yeah look at this ah yes yes look at this oh look at that there we go okay so I can use js2 liver okay well this case that's okay to see the end if age is broken that's good see let me shake shy shy shy I won't write a note here cuz chris is there in the slag group alright so this is my I'm gonna use this okay I'm back okay I'm back it turns out that there's just a little bug with this CDN link and so I'm gonna use a different CDN link which is this one and it's working check the map web page for whatever the currently working version of this is by the time this video gets published hopefully it'll it'll probably be fixed okay Napa is now loaded excellent okay so now we can go back and we can go to this tutorial once again I was on this simple map tutorial and we can see here what's the next step I want to create now there's different kinds of maps I can create there's what I'm and the world is broader than just this but I'm gonna talk about two right now there's a static map and a tile map a static map is a map that's just give me the map it's the image of the map I'm gonna draw it I'm never gonna change a tile map is one that I want to move around zoom in and out of and the reason why it's called a tile map is because the way that the mapping API has generally load it is they loaded as a bunch of different tiles because you don't wanna get one big image all at once you get a bunch of different image than they get tiled so I want to create a tile map and this gives that the arguments here is like well what do I want where do I want the map to be centered around and what zoom level do I want to be so let's try napa my map equals map a tile tile map so i want to say i'm gonna go back to here and i'm gonna say I'm gonna say let train map and I'm gonna say a train map equals mapa tile map and let's just give it a latitude longitude of zero zero and a zoom level of four that was what's in the tutorial and let's see if we see that at all I'm gonna go here and so now one thing is hi let me let me meet saying let me get rid of the canvas all right so I probably missing a step here I know that I have to overlay the canvas but let's see I don't see the map yet do I need to overlay the canvas or yes I guess if I don't overlay the canvas the map doesn't show up perhaps creator of map Allah is in in the chat right here so I might here in a second what I'm saying that's wrong so I'm going to so I need a reference to the canvas I'm gonna say canvas then I'm gonna say canvas equals create canvas and then I want to say to which do I say which the the map a map I want to say the training map I want the canvas to sit on top of it overlay yeah I do so confirm breaking news I do have to overlay I'm not going to see the map unless I overlay the canvas on top of it okay so these are the steps here I want a canvas that I could draw on I want a tile map and then I want my canvas to sit on top of it so now if we go here whoops train map overlay is not a function mmhmm Oh camera that's another edit point train map overlay train map overlay is not a function okay what I'm doing a terrible job here let me go to the tutorial my map dot overlay canvas did I take overlay with a capital L yes I did overlay is one word people lowercase L okay here we go unload setup sketch mmm what did I get wrong now new map a leaflet just giving up on the no editing thing does it not work with preload I have notifications on my phone does it not like preload let's just take this out for a second shouldn't matter line 14 which is here canvas train map and actually this map a tile map overlay canvas hmm click back through the stack Oh does it expect to promise no oh I did it not ready yet let's look no this is what it says in the tutorial here let's try previous version of mapa nah there we go okay everybody we found another bug just wanna make sure why am I not able to move around in the map we just make sure I get this working first how come I don't actually see a map oh damn I missing like another step I didn't really read the full tutorial oh yeah I need to put these in I need to put I need to say what's style we just need to specify a set of tiles a warning message so I didn't see the warning message oh you know what there is a warning message I think I have warnings turned off how do I turn warnings back on you used to the way I used to do this YouTube channel is I would do this like in class during the day and I would work all this stuff out then it would come on to YouTube and I'd have all this stuff worked out read the manual I be going wait where is the setting for warnings I'm kidding very like very sweaty over here show warnings I want to show warnings it's not showing me the warnings I don't need to go into settings for the warnings show warnings show warnings show me the warnings click on filter output there we go okay okay okay okay all right backing up backing up backing up Oh does pointfive require a promise no I don't think so yeah the the error is probably a p5 error so let me just move on here okay oh it's not a p51 okay I never so much for my no editing so is there was another edit there unfortunately whatever reason whatever I'm doing is throwing giving me an error I discovered if I revert back to one version earlier of the map a library then the error goes away so I can refresh oops I have to hit save and then I can refresh AHA now okay so first of all if you're watching this video hope the source code is hopefully going to by the time you're watching this be using the most recent version of map but maybe I'll have to figure that out but for now I'm going to keep going now interestingly enough it says you are not using any tiles for your map try with so one of the things is I have to specify a particular set of tiles that I want to load and I would have just read further down in the tutorial it would show me that actually one way to do that is to put all of those things like I was saying I want the center to be zero zero and the zoom level to be four now I need to also give it a style all those can go into a JavaScript object so I'm just gonna copy paste this from here this is a YouTube video where I am copy pasting code from the tutorial and like making lots of mistakes still somehow anyway and then I'm going to put this here and then I'm going to put instead of putting the arguments directly in the function I'm just gonna write the variable name options we are now going to refresh again and now look at this there is my map so one thing I really want to do is I want to give myself more space to work with so let's try like 800 by 600 and I think I want to zoom out by default a lot more so what I know I think a lower number would be zooming out yeah that's maybe too much 1.5 all right that'll do to start okay so this is what how I want it to load initially and again maybe zero zero isn't the best middle point and there's all sorts of other things I could do but no we've got the map there now I just want to do something I just want to say ellipse 100150 let's just see what happens if I draw and I'm gonna do a nice purplish color which is my favorite color do this look at this there's that ellipse now that ellipse is staying where it is so they're at a minimum what I have right now is the ability to draw over the map and I can do all of the map interactions and my p5 canvases right there now I have to be careful if I were to put this background here I don't see that map anymore and what I really should be doing is using the clear function the clear function is like putting a background that's fully transparent so this now you can see I don't know if you could notice this before without the clear function there was some funny antialiasing going on because I was drawing the circle actually on top of itself multiple times okay but the point is what I want to do is let's say I have a circle that's on the map over here if i zoom in I want that circle to stay where it is and grow with the map okay so how do we do that let's go back to the tutorial and I'm not gonna worry about lat/long but oh yeah no no I do want to worry about that so this is the key here lap map lat/long to pixel so the idea here is that I have a latitude and longitude and I want to find the pixel location of that no matter where the map is so let's let's just take this no matter what the zoom is let's take this and copy it into our code and I should now see it refresh oops I got an error again la Oh my map I called a train map so we can see there is now a circle here hopefully on top of the country of Nigeria looks right to me and I can zoom in and we can see that circle is continuing to move as I move the map around now here's the thing so I happen to find that from the example thankfully I just got a message in the chat for the next thing was about to look for which is a data set that has the lat longitude value for every single country so I'm just gonna I think I could probably Google for it canonical countries CSV lat/long something like that would probably yes this is what I'm looking for I'm looking for the countries dot CSV data set and this now has a country each every country with the latitude and longitude associated with it so how do i download this country's that CSV you'd think there'd be a download of sprinkles paid somewhere somebody's gonna tell me how to download this uh tutorial guides I could star it I like it I'm gonna give it five stars uh I don't know I don't know where to download this samples overview no this menus not helping me I'm just looking to chat like I become so lazy in my live streaming that instead of trying to never figure anything out I just hit her wait till somebody that jet tell me what I'm this thing which is really not good oh my goodness is five o'clock already this is not good this is not going as expected do I have to like query it somehow geo XML oh it's gonna give it to me in XML samples okay samples canonical concepts is it the geo on all files no geo not taught us entity no geographic canonical concepts don't download from here there's another oh that gist okay syndra sore huh schist and number one three four one six nine nine okay this will work okay download buttons in all files we hold on I really want to figure this out all files where's all files let me go back to samples tutorial all files downloads ah here we go but like tutorial date isn't weird this is crazy yeah it would be easier to copy/paste at this point wouldn't it my cuts over here I really need to just put the chat over there that's ridiculous this really seems insane am I in the right place even remotely close to the right place canonical concept geo all files downloads there we go same thing let's try downloading some of these toriel ah to sit it's got five countries in it okay so that's the tutorial maybe it's the DSP L tools alright I'm gonna give up I'm gonna give up and use that Geist at the bottom there's a CSV link okay hold on hold on Kelly Murphy is sending me a mess message public date okay hold on developers.googl e.com/appsscript CSV let's get this page that's not a dolly that's just to this page okay okay where's the gist okay okay if somebody can figure out for me you can figure out how you download this file sure I could copy paste it I can't find anywhere on this page of how to download this file and Norah in the chat seems to be telling me so I'm moving on I got a nice suggestion there is this github gist and I can just click over here to raw and this is now every single country code with the lat/long I'm going to assume that this is correct I'm going to copy paste this into a new file I'm gonna call this country's dot CSV and I'm gonna paste it in here so now I have au not CSV it's JSON excuse me countries JSON and so good so now I have all the countries and their lat/long by a and JSON so now I need to go back to my code and I am going to say let me have another variable called countries and I'm gonna say countries equals load JSON and countries dot JSON so now I want to just make sure that that came in okay console dot log countries well I'm gonna be going away for a couple weeks after I record this video and get back everything's gonna make sense and work again in my tutorials I'm not gonna make all these mistakes and never get anything that okay so there we go so now I can see excellent so I have I want to have beautiful the object I can actually look up by the country code great I can look up by the country code which is exactly what I want so now let us let me take this loop I'm gonna go over here kind of I think that in a moment I am going to now get the country ID now I think something a little bit funny is going on here where if I look here the country IDs are in capital letters and in my countries JSON file they're lowercase letters so I'm gonna need to be conscientious about that so I want to say let country equal Roget country ID and I'm gonna say I'm think I could just say to lower case is that a JavaScript function in Java there's definitely a string function that sends thing to lowercase so I think that's right then I can get the lat/long is is what I want to look at the countries by country and so now that's going to give me that array with lat/long and then the latitude is the lat/long index 0 and the longitude is the lat/long index 1 and now I'm gonna say I want to say the pixels pixel coordinate is train map and now I not hard coding it I'm getting it from that so now I say I'm getting it from that the JSON file lat/long and then now let's draw an ellipse at and I'm just gonna call this pics at pics X pix dot y 20/20 so now I should see a circle at every single country where there is at least one person who subscribes to the channel and here we go what did I get wrong here cannot read you know interestingly enough this is live this is like this very generic error that's coming up no matter what if I do something wrong sketched out yes line 41 what have I done wrong let me look let's look at these first console dot log country let's take a look to make sure my countries are actually correct those look right those look like reasonable country codes let's say no loop by the way because right now I just want to do it once okay so those look like the country codes now let's see so this is countries countries dot ad is that and so I should be saying a console.log lat/long let's look at that okay oh there's some that are undefined so first whatever reason I have some countries in my dataset that I don't have a lat/long for so I that's why I got that error message so I just need to be careful about that and I need to say only if lat/long exists like there's some that are undefined then I should be able to pull the lat longitude out and draw a circle and let me get rid of no loop now let me say fill 255 0 200 let me put my semicolon there oh yes so look at this look at all of you beautiful people all over the world who are subscribed to this channel from all these different countries this is amazing oh and I got this horrible thing going on where I'm console logging got to get rid of that you do not want a console log from within a loop within a loop zillion things that'll really mess stuff up let's go find Australia Australia look at this let's can we find a country with nobody I'm not sure country that I need to so we really got the center of everything this is great okay so now we're getting somewhere I can see everything there and now what I want to do is actually size the circles according to the total number of subscribers okay hmm here's the thing Oh timeout for a sec okay here's the thing now first of all I want to use the whiteboard but I'm working on this color classifier with tensorflow yes these are all my notes from and I don't want to writes it so just bear with me here this is like a moment of insanity here I am going to talk you through something in a little like blank area where's the blankest the blankest of the blank areas looks like this is a nice little blank area over here that I can use can you see all that I got to get to the barbershop before it closes you can't go I'm in town looking like this we try that one more time alright here's the thing I want to talk you through something that's a really important little crucial detail here and I want to divert it for you but maybe what I can do is just turn the camera I'm working on this I'm working on this oh boy I shut the camera off by accident am i back yes I'm working on this tensorflow J s color classifier and I didn't want to race my notes for it so now I think I have some extra space over here so sorry for being completely like a crazy person not like whatever I'm gonna diagram this for you here so here's the thing I am drawing circles in p5 with the ellipse function can you see that I think you can the ellipse function so let's say this is a circle with a diet with a die diameter of 10 and this is a circle with a diameter of 5 okay circle with a diameter of 10 circle the diameter 5 let's say this is a country with 10 subscribers and this is the country with 5 subscribers have I visualized this accurately no the answer is no why think about this for a second if I were to do this this is a bar chart 5 and this is 10 you know this is accurate this is twice the size of this is this twice the size of this will the radius here is 5 I make these like 8 and 4 the point let me make these 8 in 4 just just please please please please allow me to make them 8 and 4 so the radius is 4 and the radius here is 2 right so what is the area of this pi rsquared 16 pi the area of this pi r squared 4 PI this is actually four times the size as this so I need to be conscientious about this what I actually want to do is take the total number of subscribers and apply the square root to it so that when I when when it's being visualized into a circle it will actually be representative the area of that circle will represent the total number of subscribers okay we can go we can come back over here now all right so here we go this is where I am let me see what was the zoom level when I open it up great so now what I want to do is I should be able to write here say let subscriber I like let's say like sub count equal Roget and I already forgot what's in the CSV file if I quickly look at it here it is just the word subscribers subscribers and I'm going to say let diameter equal the square root of the sub count and I definitely should do some sort of mapping but I'm not going to worry about that right now and then I'm just going to then put diameter here and I'm gonna give this some alpha because I have a feeling I'm gonna have some really big circles and now I'm gonna refresh there we go look at this we have now visualize the subscribers and we can see here this makes sense like there is a lot of subscribers in India and we can look at we can look at Africa we can see that South Africa and Kenya and Nigeria if we look up here in Europe we can kind of see here that Deutschland Germany and England over here we can see the different countries France so this is actually and this should be accurate I could write the number there's so much I could do here visualization wise this really isn't like a tutorial and in the end about you know the visualization I'm really just trying to get the mechanics of it to work and one thing I might want to do I mean that the circles are just so wheat why are they oh they should be sized according to the zoom level Oh weird I'm sorry I'm looking at the chat oh sorry people are in the chatter talking about other stuff um I just realized something the circles are not resizing according to according to the zoom level so how do I do that there's got to be a way in the map a library let's look at let's look at the API so if I go under leaflet we can see look this is actually changing right we can see this example the circles are changing and let's see how that's done map dot zoom so map zoom so this is a way that I can use the zoom level of the map to change the size of the circles so one way I could do that is by saying something like diameter divided divided by train map dot zoom is it just dot zoom oh it's a function dot soon so let's see what happens there where do I go now oops ah where was where was I come back did I lose it oh no I'm over here okay so now Oh No I think I need to multiply it by zoom hold on I have a new sponsor pause for a second no don't let I have to thank the sponsor after thank you it's clx thank you it's C like solo new sponsor I got to get those emojis and icons okay all right if you think about it the zoom level right I come back to my crazy little place over here if you can share with me for a second if I have a circle like this a higher zoom number is me zooming in so I don't want to divide by the zoom level I want to multiply by the zoom level because the size of the circle is going to be what it is at zoom level one if i zoom in by two that circle should grow twice the size so I don't know why I didn't really need to walk over there but mentally I need to take a break okay mentally I just need to take a break here so I so what I need to do is say times zoom and then now look at this it's everything's way too big so now I need to figure out an effective way to to lower everything so one thing I could do is I could find that I probably should just like preprocess the data in setup right there's no reason for me to like do all this parsing over and over again so let me preprocess the data in setup and I'm going to create my own array so I'm gonna say data is just an array I'm gonna say data is an array then I'm gonna go to setup I'm gonna paste in that loop I'm gonna get the country and then here I'm gonna get the pixel oh I don't want the pixel location I just want the lat/long and the sub count so then I'm going to say what am I gonna say here I'm gonna say data dot push I'm just going to make an object now guess what what's that thing called in the new what's that thing called in new JavaScript where you I want to make an object and what I want to do is I want to say lat lat longlong lon sub count sub count this is how I this is how I always have written my code I want to create an object with these properties and the properties have the same name of the variables you don't have to do that anymore JavaScript new fancy JavaScript yes something or other allows me to just do this lat/long sub count and by definition it's going to assume that if I generate an object this way that I want the property name to be the same name I want the property name to be the same name as as the actual variable name itself D structuring I'm being told restructuring I don't know I'm structuring I'm structuring this we we are there two thousand two thousand people watching this right now are there to pause for a second enhanced objects literals it's enhanced object literals this is not going to go is a thing white very recently in something somebody told me in the slack channel about it and then I should be using it okay apparently it is known as enhanced object literals so this is an I want to create an object literal and I want to create it in an enhanced fashion so now that I have this now that I've done this now I'm gonna do a little thing here I'm gonna say max subs equals 0 and min subs equals 100 infinity now I know I know I did I am using enhanced object literals and I know there's a higher order function sort of fancy way that I could just do this instantly but I'm just going to since I already have this loop anyway I'm just gonna say if sub count is greater than what was it max subs then max subs equals sub count I just want to find what was the largest number of subscribers and I also want to find out what was the minimum number of subscribers so now that I have the minimum and the maximum if I come down here and I can now I can just say for country let country of data and oh oh I want the country ID I need that Oh No look at that I don't I guess I don't need the country idea anymore okay I mean I I want to save the country ID so now I just want to say I don't need this if anymore I don't need this lat long all the parsing has to be done I just want to say now I just want to say country dot lat country dot long and then I don't need to the sub count is right country dot sub count and I want to say that and this should be a constant so should be I'm gonna say the square root of hmm boy I'm having a lot of extra square roots here let me let me actually add let me do this let square let me do square squirt square root I'm gonna just put the diameter in here square I'm gonna to calculate it up here just once and I'm gonna add this in here and then you know what I'm gonna do let's just do all this up here I'm gonna just do this parsing up here too then I'm gonna go through it again one more time yeah yeah I know I could use a higher order function I expect many pull requests and comments about that and I'm gonna say and now I'm going to say let country of data and I'm gonna say country dot diameter equals map the country's diameter between the switch goes between the square root right right right right right I don't want to put the diameter in here I'm gonna add I'm gonna add a new probe there's no reason I'm gonna add this property here and I'm gonna map I'm gonna same in diameter is the square root of the min subscribers and the max let's just say mindy and the max d is the square root of the maximum number of subscribers so now i'm going to map the countries the square root of the country's subscribers which has a range between mindy and max D and I'm going to map that between 10 and 100 and that's the country's diameter so I wanted I want to process I want to just sort of like normalize the data within some range add the diameter property and then right down here I don't need to do any calculations I'm just gonna say pick sex pics why country dot diameter and you know with the ellipse function by the way you don't need to do the width and the height if they're equal and then I'm gonna say train map dot zoom okay I think we might have gotten somewhere here I don't need this anymore and now here we go let's refresh Oh max sub is not defined okay where do I call max subs max subs hmm we're all all of you where are all of you subscribers Oh did everybody unsubscribe all of a sudden because of how long it's taking me to do this and how what a mess this video is okay oh not yet no okay let's do console.log data let's take a look at this let's see what's in that object okay the object is an array with lat/long sub count ooh diameter equals not a number so I messed something up there so let's see oh this has to be outside of here why is that in there Oh so this is something I want to do right before I do this mapping I don't know why I had that in there well you still should have worked let's console.log min subs and Max subs see does that getting a real zero and 98 that doesn't seem right more than I have more so max subs a zero min subs is infinity if sub count is greater than max subs hmm that seems weird oh yeah my sizes are probably way too small but hold on those seem like strange numbers to me zero and 98 I have more than nine subscribers okay country dot sub count where did I get that wrong oh yeah but still why is max subs here so so low let's look at this console dot log sub count huh yeah look at this there are some much larger numbers in here do I have that in the wrong place subscribe I know that this is wrong blind 59 yeah I know that this is sub count I see that now but I'm wondering why is this saying 98 right here Oh square root no no no but a console blog did here did my square rooting it's somewhere else oh I square it no no no this is unnecessary look at this one more time hold on why why why all right I have let's look at this console look sub count max subs welcome to watching somebody not able to figure out a problem debugging debugging 9898 look at this are they string somehow because oh they must their strings they're not numbers look at this if they're strings in alphabetical order 9 8 is greater than 9 79 I was not being careful the value that I'm getting out of the table is not a number I need to convert it to a number it's by default and I think probably I might have been I'll say something like get number in with the p5 API or I'm not sure let's see get number is that part of p5 no but I could say get and then convert it write a CSV everything is by default text and these should probably I don't know why these sort of worked somehow oh because it came in as an array and somehow oh no because I I'm pulling it I'm that's coming from the JSON file and they are numbers in the JSON file the CSV it was only text so now there we go that's the maximum number of subscribers that makes sense I can get rid of this I have I should see right there we go so now if i zoom in the sizes aren't changing right the size no but I want it to change oh did I not put that in you know I'm multiplying by zoom so let's let's see something here yeah what did I get wrong yep console dot log train map zoom let's make sure I got this right the zoom is to zoom is 3 flip min subs and Max subs know they right but I want them to be a fixed so I think it's doing what it's supposed to do right cuz the more it is working but that's not what I wanted to do I want it to be the same size they don't want to be 0 right I want this to be much much smaller now so I did want it to divide by the zoom I just need to make them much bigger then let me so in other words hold on is the zoom linear oh wait let me think about this it's nonlinear that's the problem that's the problem multiplying is correct it's nonlinear so long so what did what did Chris do in the example plus my map zoom huh that's interesting I mean that's one way so is it is it just squared yeah is it just squared yeah No oh yeah I just needed to do the same thing square root right that's now doing what I expected all right look at this look at how that circle is over the United States no no I mean it's sort of an interesting so what is the formula leaflet why is everything more complicated than a nice zoom is probably working as a more complex object which you build using those integers yeah yeah power to to the zoom oh oh well that's interesting it's some silly Google ratio yeah I think there's a standard I've read about this before I've encountered this before zoom a Google Maps API zoom what's the right zoom level range yeah there's some Mercator projection so the scale varies substantially with latitude a formula for correct is based on latitude is to this Wow oh but maybe if it's yeah log scale makes sense log base 2 I think that's part let's look at the mapa API no so there isn't a isn't necessarily a so this would be an interesting to add to Napa power to to the divided by power 2 to the zoom or cater let's see hold on no multiply I probably have to go ahead and use that everything's way too big now oh yeah this looks right right I mean I'm not sure that that yeah I think this is right now yeah I mean it might be slightly off to to the zoom okay great right I got first where did I leave off let's just go yeah here let's go back to here okay so interestingly enough this is not a surprise here but this is not a linear relationship as i zoom in from 1 to 2 or 2 to 4 I'm not actually just doubling the size so formula that I can actually use it has to do with the way the zoom that that the way that I'm learning a lot from doing this video it turns out and this shouldn't have been a surprise to me I have encountered this before I think that it's not a linear relationship when I zoomed from 1 to 2 or 2 to 4 I'm not just doubling the size in fact so multiplying by the zoom isn't really getting me a consistent size circle as I'm moving and zooming around so what I really actually want to do is not multiplied by the zoom value and I think I'm just going to be a little easier to see if I say constant zoom equals so just put it in a variable train map zoom and what I want to do is the scale the scale I'm just going to say SC l because there's a function in p5 called scale is 2 to the zoom power now this I don't know if this is a hundred percent exactly right but so I'd have to maybe do some research on this and maybe someone the comments can give me some help here if I'm if I'm getting this right but let me just put this in now scale now now the problem is now I'm multiplying by a very large number so this is kind of looks a little bit out of control so let me go back to my values up here where I was doing this mapping and I'm actually gonna have I'm gonna map between 2 and 10 so the minimum number of subtractions go between 1 pixel and 10 pixels so now if i refresh here we can move around and we can see like look at this you can see here if i zoom in on Brazil you can sort of see look look at the size of this circle right and then we keep zooming in it's kind of staying the same size relative to the country so this is the effect that I wanted and again me being off by a slight amount and now I could potentially say like okay well actually I'm happy to go I mean all the way up to 5050 and we can kind of see here maybe this helps a little bit but now everything's kind of on top of everything else so I liked it maybe let me go back to 20 you know anyway so the point is this isn't necessarily the best way to visualize this data maybe what I actually want to do is visualize something about the number of subscribers per like relative to population or maybe what I actually want to do is get the sort of geo JSON data which is like an outline of all the countries to fill them in but I at least have done this and guess what just as a quick little extra thing to add to the end of this video and by the way look at all these subscribers down here in the Virgin Islands is that where I'm looking at the wrong plates that's kind of amazing to me I'm gonna swap out my CSV file let's quickly look at the watch time file the watch time also has country ID and watch time in minutes now the nice thing is the nice thing is I already built in all this stuff to kind of normalize the data between the minimum and maximum I could also look at views maybe I should look at views watch time probably makes more sense so I could really briefly right here change this out and I probably should have just called this I'm going to call this instead of subscriber data I'm gonna just do a find and replace subscriber data with like YouTube data replace all and I'm now going to swap this out and say watch time Gio I'm gonna comment this out and the only thing I need to change is I also want to get here now instead of subscribers I want what was it called again a watch underscore time underscore minutes watch underscore time underscore minutes also by the way had one in sub count I should change also which was views let me just change this everywhere it's a sub count let me just change this to count just to be more generic about it and let's make sure the okay and so where it where am I here sorry views let's see if this works with views there we go so now we're looking at this map based on views and now let's look at watch time and I can go to switch it out just by commenting it to watch time minutes oh look the same be interesting to see what's the relative difference these are like watch time per subscriber that's something I could visualize here I'm sure that many of you watching this could come up with a much more stylish or perhaps more effective way of communicating this so here's the thing I will publish these data files along with the source code for this particular video I would love to see you maybe we can have some rainbow themed train themed visualizations and try it with other try it with other mapping api's try thinking about it in different ways how can you communicate this data better than I have and I hope you will share that with me so thanks for tolerating this video which is very very long where I struggled with a lot of aspects but to me this is a really exciting that I can have a tiled map that I can zoom in and interactively move around as well as draw on top so by the way these can all be animations this is the other thing like so I've done nothing visually or interesting here really or I'm not animating anything and that's the other thing you should really think about right so just to like quickly make that if I say like frame count module is 255 and you know the the scale the size the is the scale is also times you know sign a frame count times 0.01 or something right I'm just gonna add some weird stuff to animate it right you could see that these are now hold on let me have that animate a little faster 0.1 you can see that they're blinking right and that blinking is going to stay consistent as I move around the map and the color is changing so this is the other thing you could do you can animate this stuff so what can you do with this data what can you do with your own data what can you do with maps that look like this with other maps think about the projection that you're using research about different mapping projections in different ways of showing maps and make something share with me in the comments share with me at Schiffman on twitter and also look for the link in the video's description to the coding trade comm page where you can submit a contribution a link out to one of your contributions as well okay thanks for watching this and thanks for subscribing I mean maybe you didn't subscribe it's just fine you don't have to subscribe but for those of y'all subscribed thank you thank you for watching thank you for everything it's an honor and a privilege for me to get to make these video tutorials and have and reach people all over the world and let's just have a look one more time and all of you all over the world there you are all of you all over the world thank you okay I got through that is that is that really very fun to like dev DeMarcos Rosa wants to see wants to see my city where's your city Canadia I don't think it's called Canadia where's Canada so this is Canada here all right I'm gonna take off that so one that that this crazy stuff and I'll leave the color cycling because I think that's useful for I mean just to sort of make the point okay Thank You Sammy Hoss whoo all right I've really got to go this did not happen in the one hour I'd planned for everything always takes me longer everything is always harder than you think that's the way of coding maybe for you you just breeze through everything but I don't think so I think you're probably more like me you get tripped up everywhere it's always embarrassing and I hope you enjoyed this live stream could you make it that we can see where the viewers of this live stream are so in theory that's possible but I'd have to probably use the YouTube API for that I could try to research that and see but I've got to go it's almost six o'clock and barber shops that's gonna go with definitely closed so I don't know I guess this is me this is what you're stuck with I I should read some random numbers for the 500th livestream not the five livestream them for whatever I'm gonna go to page 500 there isn't a page 500 the random numbers only 400 is their page 500 for the I guess I could read 500 random numbers let's just do 50 I don't know what to do Oh 500 plus 100 400 plus 100 is 500 so I just need to go to 100 here we go one point four eight four negative one point five one seven point seven four zero point seven eight five point four seven seven one point one zero nine negative negative one point one zero nine 10.27 two negative negative point nine four six negative two point two eight eight crud that's the closest time you get to swearing I think I for once 0.163 one point two eight one negative one point nine two three zero point six six one zero point two one five two point three seven three one point six eight six one point four nine three all right everybody so Cal amok in the chat is asking how can you add country ID in numbers into those bubbles so I could use the text function I could use a Dom element but just really quickly just to see like if I were to say fill I know I the way I didn't keep the country ID here so I would need to add it to this but I could use the text function so I'd love to see people do that the ukelele alright the can't I can't resist let's do some random number ukulele you see I want you to be able to see that this is the book well it's never gonna prop up I'm gonna make this work somehow Stan Stan book every but now you can all understand how I broke my elbow so easily last summer okay there we go there we go can you read that that's a million random digits I guess so but we should probably put this here sixtysix thousand six hundred no that's not the right cord oh whatever look I only started trying to learn to play the ukulele three weeks ago so cut me some slack thank you thank you all right everybody thank you for subscribing to this channel please stay in touch I releasing a lot of video content all the edited versions of all this live stream nonsense I won't look at any of that over the next few weeks I might you might not see me with a new live stream until July so but I will be back and we'll be back to finish those tensorflow j/s color classifier I will try to do a convolutional neural network with Tessa flowy has to do an image classifier I think that's that's the gonna be the end of what I want to do with tensorflow jest and then I'm going to move to the ml 5 library which is just a late on top attention flow Genesis nobodies I'll still be using that so May oh yes random music Jenner all sorts of things must come eventually but it just takes a long time to code stuff it's a little time all right everybody will this live stream yes this live stream will be available the instant I press stop after URL that you are currently watching it does go to unlisted and then I will make it listed once much' who helps me manage the channel has a chance to like put a description and time codes and things like that ok everybody have a wonderful week I will definitely not be back any day this week if things the stars align I will be back sometime next week or sometime in July but I will be on the internet so you can find me on Twitter and you you I always read all the comments I really do read all the comments on the channel and I just thank you this has been this this has been a really surprising thing that's happened to me in the last few years I mean I think that I did I first I'm pretty sure that I didn't I I don't I think I uploaded the first hold on let's go I uploaded the first video tutorial to YouTube I haven't been making them on Vimeo for quite a while in the fall of 2015 and then and then if I go to like the livestream playlist I don't know if that's on here I where I go to playlists unlisted live streams oh boy what's in their live stream live stream I could really use some where are the live do I have to like oh I have to keep like scrolling down this is insane there we go live stream archives this is July 29th 2013 oh yeah this is I attempted to do a live stream on July 29th 2013 which it's definitely is my birthday that's kind of interesting July 29 look there's sean vann every this is a test using Google Hangouts but then this is the real first live stream with the system I have now which was September 4th 2015 so it has been I can't do this math almost three years and so thank you you can watch all these live streams good night everybody have a wonderful evening morning night sleep all those sorts of things enjoy some fresh air give a hug to a friend do something good in the world if you can be kind and I will see you next time let's find something we wanna make some crazy idea we'll figure out what it takes to make that dream understand imagine creation you you
