00:00 - hello it's me dan Schiffman strangely
00:02 - not in front of a green screen not in
00:04 - this little like cramped room I'm here
00:06 - actually at a place called ITP it's
00:08 - where I spent almost all of my time ITP
00:10 - is a two-year master's program there's a
00:12 - little over 200 students here working
00:14 - all semester to create a lot of
00:16 - interesting strange projects that make
00:18 - all sorts of new and innovative uses of
00:20 - Technology ITP as part of Tisch School
00:22 - of the Arts at New York University but
00:24 - really one thing that ITP is really
00:25 - about is people people in ideas not
00:27 - about the technology so I'm excited to
00:29 - be here to introduce you to some of
00:30 - those people and the projects that
00:31 - they've made so I'm gonna wander around
00:32 - the floor show you some stuff if you are
00:36 - interested in finding out more about ITP
00:37 - or these projects you can take a look at
00:38 - this video's description where I'll have
00:39 - links to everything and I'm talking very
00:41 - fast that I'm not sure why but I'm a
00:42 - little panicked here in this new
00:44 - location okay see you soon in a minute
00:46 - because I'll still be here
00:55 - hey can we video your project I'm yeah
00:59 - so song and my project name is
01:02 - illuminated path so this is a light bulb
01:04 - that follows you and when it finds a
01:07 - person it deems up and they'll follow
01:09 - you
01:10 - why lighting it's on then like when you
01:12 - are going out then it dims out where do
01:15 - you imagine this living if it were to be
01:17 - somewhere besides the a TV show someone
01:18 - told me about cave also many 12 people
01:24 - talked about I wish I have this at home
01:27 - so I can save the energy and I don't
01:30 - need to right turn it on and off and
01:31 - just uh follow me and I work in cool I
01:34 - love it
01:36 - I'm Jenny Lim I'm Tom tenkan and our
01:40 - project laser cats is a two-player game
01:42 - where one user controls the laser and
01:44 - one user is the cat and tries to catch
01:46 - the laser and the the paws have are
01:50 - light-sensitive so when you catch the
01:52 - laser with your paw you get a point
01:54 - what's that what's the high score low
01:56 - 30s yeah
01:58 - what can I try it now
02:01 - [Music]
02:09 - hi my name is Chris this play is called
02:12 - Tac Toe and it's my final ICM project so
02:16 - it always works if you have a bird
02:18 - flying around which are basically images
02:20 - people sent to this number and all the
02:22 - images are transformed into birds so the
02:25 - way it works is you take the green box
02:28 - put it wherever you want in the wall
02:30 - like here for instance and you can get a
02:33 - bird from that image the less people's
02:36 - someone sent and then you can grab this
02:39 - box and shake it and the wave will stop
02:43 - flapping and then you can text okay so
02:52 - I'm gonna put this here
02:55 - I'm gonna make a lot my name is Lindsay
03:08 - and my project is pop-up forest which is
03:11 - a couple spreads from a pop-up book that
03:13 - also influenced their own seeing its it
03:21 - becomes night time and things you do
03:25 - down here like rustling in the bushes
03:27 - bring out foxes you can add more
03:31 - fireflies to the scene and if you add
03:34 - enough fireflies all the foxes will put
03:36 - on sunglasses so there's another one you
03:40 - can scare all the foxes away because
03:44 - foxes are definitely afraid of Alice
03:45 - where'd you get the idea for like this
03:47 - is our story here everywhere the
03:49 - particular characters are the content
03:50 - where did you come up with that idea I
03:52 - think for my animation project it was
03:56 - outside I've been doing a lot of
03:57 - projects that were outside and using
03:59 - like outside noises and so I don't know
04:03 - that soundscape is really nice to me so
04:05 - the idea of generating an environment
04:07 - that you could also immerse yourself in
04:08 - was really nice this is Sebastian
04:11 - Daniella this project is called unit of
04:15 - measurement we're interested in light
04:18 - and balance and geometrical patterns and
04:21 - the idea behind it is we kind of wanted
04:24 - to make visible the interconnections of
04:26 - space we have been working on this break
04:28 - for the past couple of months a lot of
04:30 - experimentation playing with different
04:33 - ways to make bubbles and create these
04:34 - geometries this is our final piece well
04:38 - it was an interesting process because we
04:40 - we kind of went deep into studying how
04:42 - bubbles house up bubbles are made we
04:44 - went to a lab at Cooper Union we
04:47 - experimented with glycerine with all
04:49 - these fun kinds of stuff but right now
04:52 - what what is for also it's amazing is
04:54 - the patterns and the colors so that we
04:56 - can see in the film of the bubble which
04:58 - has a lot to do with gravity and
05:00 - hi I'm Haley and my project is this is
05:06 - virtual levator that can turn I can
05:09 - travel to corridors to the helipad layer
05:13 - of the sky so where'd you get the idea
05:15 - for this right well I just imagined that
05:18 - if there is a super long elevator then
05:20 - you can travel like a anywhere like a
05:23 - particularly so I just my name is Yoon
05:37 - and we created a series of musical lamps
05:41 - which is interactive which it can be
05:44 - spun by the users and can creative a
05:46 - light and sound try different material
05:53 - and then for this route land with piano
05:56 - music is hearty and depends on the anger
05:59 - to use the speed you will generate
06:01 - different kind of our music check and
06:03 - this one is like six jumps behind this a
06:07 - credit land and this is from Metro you
06:10 - can hear it like Dena named Amanda so
06:12 - they can come by with four different
06:15 - kind of firm music together and create
06:18 - over a harmony peace
06:19 - my name is Stephanie Colton and this is
06:21 - birds and sea which is a bird Orchestra
06:23 - that you control the ammos so it's based
06:27 - on Carey Reilly's and C project
06:31 - so these are different phrases for each
06:36 - representing each phrase that Terry
06:38 - Riley Road and they've been
06:40 - using birdsongs so you can add different
06:42 - birds and move them through that work
06:48 - this trap or the piece around our yards
06:54 - [Music]
06:58 - so the bird sounds are from this bird
07:00 - enthusiasts website that people have
07:02 - uploaded they're recorded sounds from
07:04 - the wild and so I grabbed a couple of
07:06 - those and extracted what approximated a
07:09 - note see so birds don't actually sort of
07:11 - sing notes as we conventionally know
07:13 - them but you can approximate their
07:15 - frequency and then grab a C and then I
07:18 - use that and pitch adjusted and
07:20 - stretched it to form the different notes
07:22 - in this scale and then place those in
07:24 - the order that Terry Riley had proposed
07:26 - them into the different phrases this is
07:28 - a leading question because I know the
07:29 - answer but what did you use to build it
07:30 - oh I used v5 can you believe it
07:33 - and the sound library for all the sound
07:34 - stuff or something yeah no I use the p5
07:37 - sound library awesome great thank you
07:40 - yeah I'm ccino ccino kim and this is my
07:44 - project operator and it's basically an
07:46 - old telephone switchboard where that
07:49 - lets you make telephone calls to anyone
07:52 - and record those the audio from those
07:55 - close calls in and and then play around
07:59 - with this the recorded sounds that add
08:01 - sample add effects and just kind of like
08:04 - make
08:08 - [Music]
08:25 - my name is Becca Rix I'm Rita which is a
08:31 - it's a vr documentary based on an
08:33 - interview that we did with a friend of
08:35 - mine who's a refugee from Sierra Leone
08:37 - she moved to the United States in 2001
08:40 - and so we interviewed her to asking
08:42 - questions about her sense of home and
08:44 - identity and how it evolved over the
08:46 - years and kind of how her view of
08:47 - herself has changed so we made kind of
08:50 - audio documentary out of nine pieces and
08:55 - each piece represents a different memory
08:58 - that he I'ma be sharing and for that for
09:01 - each memory we created a 3d object that
09:03 - we put in the VR ik environment that
09:05 - represent the audio that the the memory
09:08 - that she's talking about people said I
09:12 - am like the female version of my dad
09:15 - meaning I am very outspoken and I'm very
09:18 - protective
09:22 - I think the difference is between my dad
09:25 - and I I kind of discover later on even
09:28 - when you take your people don't forget
09:29 - to take care of yourself
09:31 - [Music]
09:34 - we're what are the images because when I
09:36 - you know I didn't have my glasses on so
09:37 - they they're like a little but so they
09:39 - had kind of like a distorted or
09:40 - painterly quality to them is that on
09:42 - purpose or how did you make decisions
09:43 - about the visuals the store purpose so
09:46 - we really liked the idea of using
09:47 - photogrammetry because there's sort of a
09:49 - fragmentary distorted aesthetic to it
09:51 - that to us kind of matched the way
09:53 - memory works and the way you recall
09:54 - things so we kind of liked that it's a
09:57 - little bit imperfect it's a little bit
09:58 - scrappy but it kind of feels like
10:00 - realistic and detailed enough to feel
10:02 - like it's a real memory okay I'm and
10:06 - these are the camel turnin cards these
10:08 - are generative coloring puzzles so the
10:11 - idea is that we have like these many
10:13 - different cards they have like a grid of
10:16 - cells where instructions expressed as
10:19 - arrows we have two different types of
10:22 - arrows
10:22 - two different colors and then following
10:25 - instructions either like continuing to
10:27 - draw with the same color or to switch to
10:30 - the other color and these are generated
10:33 - in a way Danny that if you follow these
10:35 - instructions you will eventually reveal
10:37 - a possible message my name is Francesca
10:41 - Rodriguez and this is my project called
10:43 - keepo what's the name mean by the way
10:46 - hippo means not in an Andean language
10:49 - that's called Quechua so it actually
10:51 - means not and he was also an old record
10:54 - system that was based on notes and
10:56 - chords of different colors and that's
10:58 - why he's pretty inspiring so what is the
11:01 - - can you show - yeah so actually my
11:03 - idea was that I wanted to find a way of
11:05 - how can I use technology to amplify
11:07 - those old record systems in this case
11:09 - people I was using the Incan Empire like
11:11 - thousands of years ago and I collected
11:14 - some stories about cultural identity and
11:15 - how that changes when you migrate
11:17 - somewhere else and I thought those
11:19 - stories had a lot of layers the same way
11:21 - that when you weave you have a lot of
11:22 - different layers and I kind of linked
11:24 - them together and try to think of an
11:26 - interface where people will be able to
11:28 - hear these stories but in the way we
11:30 - like consuming stories nowadays which is
11:31 - I will just go and touch these and hear
11:33 - the story I don't want to hear any more
11:35 - I will go to the other one and they
11:36 - maybe go back so that's kind of the way
11:39 - it works so whenever you touch
11:41 - these notes you will be able to hear one
11:43 - of these stories and if you want you can
11:45 - switch to the other one and then you can
11:47 - go back and kind of get that general
11:49 - feeling of cultural identity through
11:50 - these kind of old interface just with
11:53 - some like hidden technology that it's
11:56 - like for today okay so this is the
11:59 - Xperia Murrah it's a bridge between a
12:01 - film camera and an analogue of film and
12:03 - analog camera and a digital and iPhone
12:04 - camera I'm it's inspired by film cameras
12:07 - and that as you take a picture of
12:08 - filters immediately applied to the photo
12:10 - that mimics the quality of a vintage
12:12 - camera it is inspired by a digital
12:14 - camera and that you have immediate
12:15 - access to the photo because it's sent
12:17 - straight to Twitter on its own Twitter
12:18 - account by pressing a button
12:21 - I applied filter by pressing a button
12:23 - and two LEDs will light up signifying
12:26 - metafilter has been applied and when I
12:28 - capture a photo LEDs will go down the
12:30 - line signifying that the photo is
12:31 - captured so I'll take a few photos I
12:35 - think we currently have your photos
12:38 - Center
12:48 - my name is Jaso Trivedi and my project
12:51 - is a Dori the haptic meditation
12:53 - experience so what happens in the in the
12:56 - meditation experience so what happens is
12:58 - when you sit down you situate yourself
13:00 - you're guided through a five minute
13:02 - meditation on just focus on your
13:05 - breathing which will eventually lead you
13:07 - to a point of relaxation where you start
13:09 - chanting and as you chant the meditation
13:12 - platform vibrates with your voice so the
13:15 - whole the whole concept is to increase
13:18 - focus and concentration for new and
13:21 - experienced meditators the show is so
13:23 - crazy with so many people and like so
13:25 - much noise and people wonder if you'll
13:27 - really been able to meditate in it even
13:28 - with the sort of chaos that's happening
13:29 - yeah somebody actually fell asleep in
13:33 - the platform yeah people are people who
13:36 - haven't meditated before now interested
13:38 - in meditation which I mean has enormous
13:40 - health benefits and I think that's a
13:42 - great outcome this is something I very
13:44 - very much need so thank you I'm
13:48 - Sebastian and this is a very based on
13:51 - anatomical paintings and the
13:53 - construction of these paintings it works
13:56 - by reconstructing details and assigning
13:58 - triangles to those details so areas
14:00 - where the artist gave more attention are
14:03 - brought forward and sharper well
14:06 - everything is else is pushed behind how
14:10 - do you picking how did youhow are you
14:12 - picking the images that it uses like
14:13 - where'd you find those and what kind of
14:15 - content to teach you they're all
14:17 - anatomical paintings because I really
14:20 - like the big instruction of these bodies
14:23 - and the attention that is set to the
14:26 - painting so here you see a lot of
14:28 - triangles in this area which where is
14:29 - the arm that is being explained
14:37 - hi my name is Paola and I made this with
14:40 - three other teammates kochiya without
14:43 - any menu and basically what this is is
14:47 - it started under the theme of time and
14:51 - we wanted to focus on the right now and
14:54 - kind of use social media as a way that
14:57 - people use to record their lives so what
15:00 - this does is you can text your Instagram
15:03 - handle or your account to the eye and
15:05 - it'll blink and when it opens you can
15:06 - look into it and it'll show you your
15:08 - life in the blink of an eye
15:10 - basically that that's what it does I
15:12 - will text my Instagram handle to the eye
15:18 - and it'll blink
15:20 - [Music]
15:28 - hi I'm Dora Luna hi my name is Mint why
15:31 - I opened up a natural tea the project is
15:34 - called
15:35 - nom nom and it's basically controlled it
15:38 - allows you to play youtube videos as you
15:42 - wouldn't and are you picking the videos
15:44 - or they could be any video they're gonna
15:45 - be any videos you can just drop any
15:47 - videos you want and
15:52 - [Music]
16:06 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hello it's me dan Schiffman strangely not in front of a green screen not in this little like cramped room I'm here actually at a place called ITP it's where I spent almost all of my time ITP is a twoyear master's program there's a little over 200 students here working all semester to create a lot of interesting strange projects that make all sorts of new and innovative uses of Technology ITP as part of Tisch School of the Arts at New York University but really one thing that ITP is really about is people people in ideas not about the technology so I'm excited to be here to introduce you to some of those people and the projects that they've made so I'm gonna wander around the floor show you some stuff if you are interested in finding out more about ITP or these projects you can take a look at this video's description where I'll have links to everything and I'm talking very fast that I'm not sure why but I'm a little panicked here in this new location okay see you soon in a minute because I'll still be here hey can we video your project I'm yeah so song and my project name is illuminated path so this is a light bulb that follows you and when it finds a person it deems up and they'll follow you why lighting it's on then like when you are going out then it dims out where do you imagine this living if it were to be somewhere besides the a TV show someone told me about cave also many 12 people talked about I wish I have this at home so I can save the energy and I don't need to right turn it on and off and just uh follow me and I work in cool I love it I'm Jenny Lim I'm Tom tenkan and our project laser cats is a twoplayer game where one user controls the laser and one user is the cat and tries to catch the laser and the the paws have are lightsensitive so when you catch the laser with your paw you get a point what's that what's the high score low 30s yeah what can I try it now hi my name is Chris this play is called Tac Toe and it's my final ICM project so it always works if you have a bird flying around which are basically images people sent to this number and all the images are transformed into birds so the way it works is you take the green box put it wherever you want in the wall like here for instance and you can get a bird from that image the less people's someone sent and then you can grab this box and shake it and the wave will stop flapping and then you can text okay so I'm gonna put this here I'm gonna make a lot my name is Lindsay and my project is popup forest which is a couple spreads from a popup book that also influenced their own seeing its it becomes night time and things you do down here like rustling in the bushes bring out foxes you can add more fireflies to the scene and if you add enough fireflies all the foxes will put

I don't know that soundscape is really nice to me so the idea of generating an environment that you could also immerse yourself in was really nice this is Sebastian Daniella this project is called unit of measurement we're interested in light and balance and geometrical patterns and the idea behind it is we kind of wanted to make visible the interconnections of space we have been working on this break for the past couple of months a lot of experimentation playing with different ways to make bubbles and create these geometries this is our final piece well it was an interesting process because we we kind of went deep into studying how bubbles house up bubbles are made we went to a lab at Cooper Union we experimented with glycerine with all these fun kinds of stuff but right now what what is for also it's amazing is the patterns and the colors so that we can see in the film of the bubble which has a lot to do with gravity and hi I'm Haley and my project is this is virtual levator that can turn I can travel to corridors to the helipad layer of the sky so where'd you get the idea for this right well I just imagined that if there is a super long elevator then you can travel like a anywhere like a particularly so I just my name is Yoon and we created a series of musical lamps which is interactive which it can be spun by the users and can creative a light and sound try different material and then for this route land with piano music is hearty and depends on the anger to use the speed you will generate different kind of our music check and this one is like six jumps behind this a credit land and this is from Metro you can hear it like Dena named Amanda so they can come by with four different kind of firm music together and create over a harmony peace my name is Stephanie Colton and this is birds and sea which is a bird Orchestra that you control the ammos so it's based on Carey Reilly's and C project so these are different phrases for each representing each phrase that Terry Riley Road and they've been using birdsongs so you can add different birds and move them through that work this trap or the piece around our yards so the bird sounds are from this bird enthusiasts website that people have uploaded they're recorded sounds from the wild and so I grabbed a couple of those and extracted what approximated a note see so birds don't actually sort of

you believe it and the sound library for all the sound stuff or something yeah no I use the p5 sound library awesome great thank you yeah I'm ccino ccino kim and this is my project operator and it's basically an old telephone switchboard where that lets you make telephone calls to anyone and record those the audio from those close calls in and and then play around with this the recorded sounds that add sample add effects and just kind of like make my name is Becca Rix I'm Rita which is a it's a vr documentary based on an interview that we did with a friend of mine who's a refugee from Sierra Leone she moved to the United States in 2001 and so we interviewed her to asking questions about her sense of home and identity and how it evolved over the years and kind of how her view of
