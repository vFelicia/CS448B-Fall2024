00:02 - hello happy Friday greetings from live
00:05 - from New York University here at the
00:07 - Tisch Gillooly hearts it's me Daniel
00:12 - Shipman and I am here on the coding
00:17 - train to dude wait as I am most every
00:22 - Friday in this strange room which is
00:25 - actually just a closet with some filing
00:27 - cabinets and a couple computers but I'm
00:29 - here to talk about code and do some
00:31 - coding stuff and be with you the people
00:36 - of the internet and that's what I'm here
00:40 - for so if you've never watched before
00:42 - might I suggest something else to do
00:46 - you know tea is lovely to drink
00:49 - meditation is good I like listening to
00:51 - music board games I am a big fan of
00:54 - board games card games or excellent
00:57 - going outside and just playing like with
00:59 - a frisbee I don't know I always use
01:00 - frisbee as an example personally I like
01:02 - I'm not kind of like a baseball throw
01:04 - the baseball catch the baseball
01:05 - musical-theater
01:06 - find somewhere that has musical theater
01:09 - and go watch and listen and be filled
01:13 - with joy with music and dance and song
01:15 - because if you are here just watching
01:19 - this video it's just gonna be me and my
01:22 - computer over here it's not beer as well
01:26 - okay so what's going on today is the
01:30 - usual Friday there's about 4 p.m.
01:31 - Eastern Time one thing I wanted to
01:34 - mention is I'm now trying to alternate
01:36 - morning versus afternoon my time because
01:39 - I know that right now hopefully you're
01:42 - sleeping and not actually watching this
01:43 - but some of some of my international
01:45 - viewers this is quite a late slash
01:48 - middle of the night time so everything I
01:50 - do gets preserved by the glorious thing
01:54 - that is the YouTube it will archive it I
01:57 - also save my own personal backup of the
01:59 - livestream and you can always watch it
02:01 - back later so what's going to happen
02:04 - today I am would first like to cover
02:07 - some business which
02:11 - is my handy dandy guide to what's
02:14 - happening on the Kotick train there it
02:16 - is so you can go to this URL which is
02:19 - github.com slash coding train slash
02:22 - rainbow code in this readme there are
02:25 - some key links for you for example the
02:27 - YouTube channel the coding train how you
02:29 - can become a I think I should say become
02:31 - a patron like the service is patreon but
02:35 - the people are patrons so if you'd like
02:38 - to support what I'm doing in a financial
02:40 - way you can sign up become a patron and
02:42 - depending on different levels I will
02:44 - sometimes if I'm going to get around to
02:46 - it send you something in the mail you
02:48 - will also get an invitation to this
02:49 - slack channel which I am looking at
02:50 - right now where people are telling me to
02:54 - make sure ah that I stay hydrated
02:57 - because as you know coding train is
03:00 - brought to you by water you can drink it
03:10 - and then sometimes later you might have
03:13 - to go can I say I can I say can I say
03:18 - pee pee on YouTube is that okay I'm not
03:20 - sure alright boy let me tell you ever
03:25 - since I got this water sponsorship it's
03:27 - just been amazing here I mean I've never
03:28 - my life has totally changed so you can
03:32 - suggest the topic it's kind of true that
03:35 - suggesting topical it just goes through
03:37 - this giant list of stuff that I almost
03:39 - never get to but I aspire someday I will
03:43 - figure out how to make this suggest a
03:45 - topic system work if I had a good system
03:47 - for upvoting or something maybe at least
03:48 - once per week I could pull something
03:50 - from there but right now I've just got
03:51 - stuff I'm trying to get to Oh
03:53 - the holidays are coming up what could be
03:57 - better for your family friends the
04:01 - significant other person and then a
04:04 - coding train t-shirt or membership to
04:08 - the patreon or a mug anyway there's
04:12 - nothing you could buy whatever don't
04:14 - worry about it if you want to it's there
04:16 - is there mmm-hmm so that's all I have to
04:20 - say about that now this is my schedule
04:22 - of my future live streams
04:24 - I am trying to have a schedule since I
04:26 - can't have a regular weekly time what I
04:29 - at least would like to do is lay out a
04:30 - schedule in advance and so this is what
04:36 - this is today Friday November 17th 4:00
04:40 - p.m. I really need to go to the eye
04:44 - doctor it's terrible it's like it's
04:46 - either too far or too close I can't just
04:48 - go like this I have to take my glasses
04:49 - off oh okay some one of these days I
04:52 - think I really think I also need some
04:54 - more colorful glasses like something
04:56 - bright purple is really thick or
04:58 - something like that to be more stylish
05:00 - than I already am because that's you
05:02 - know I'm quite I mean this is like you
05:05 - know I am like totally with it with the
05:08 - whole YouTube thing being like you know
05:10 - super YouTube creator style person right
05:16 - I'm so old to be on YouTube okay now I'm
05:20 - looking at this what else oh so this is
05:22 - my schedule this computer doesn't have a
05:24 - power plug so everyone's wrong I have to
05:25 - so this is some stuff I'm gonna do today
05:28 - next week is a holiday here in the
05:31 - country where I live called Thanksgiving
05:33 - so I will not be having a live stream on
05:35 - Friday November 24th in fact this
05:37 - building where I broadcast from will be
05:39 - completely closed so even if I wanted to
05:41 - I could not get in here so the next live
05:44 - stream will unfortunately be two weeks
05:46 - from now but I have planning some bonus
05:48 - dates I did miss a date when I had a bad
05:51 - cold in November so right now
05:53 - tentatively speaking Wednesday December
05:54 - 13th I don't know if I take these topics
05:56 - too seriously we're probably gonna
05:58 - change them because things are changing
06:00 - in my mind I should also mention that
06:02 - especially here in New York you should
06:03 - come to this in person but if I go to
06:06 - ITP NYU edu slash show
06:12 - [Laughter]
06:15 - I should just always have this kitten
06:18 - Chrome extension so this is by the way I
06:20 - forgot that last week let me just look
06:23 - at this here are there even kittens here
06:26 - no there's not a kitten there anyway oh
06:28 - yeah look my profile picture is like
06:30 - some sort of kitten
06:30 - I forgot that last week I did a let's
06:35 - see if we refresh the page a different
06:37 - kid oh sorry it's very distracting the
06:49 - kittens but I did a chrome extension to
06:52 - changed any pictures to kittens so maybe
06:55 - I need to just turn that off briefly
06:57 - here for a second there we go let's
07:01 - disable that now I could come back to
07:04 - this website if you are here in New York
07:07 - Sunday December 17th from 2:00 to 6:00
07:10 - p.m. and Monday December 18th from 4:00
07:13 - to 8:00 p.m. you can come visit and see
07:16 - all 100 plus projects made by ITP master
07:20 - students all semester long they'll be
07:21 - showing their work I will be here I will
07:23 - also like I have done in previous shows
07:26 - do a livestream from my mobile device
07:29 - with some kind of ridiculous selfie
07:31 - stick thing oh my god even worse than
07:35 - saying P is saying sucks it's one of
07:38 - those I have one of those things that's
07:39 - got like a smoothing thing in it it
07:42 - helps you balance out whatever it is
07:43 - that you're holding so I will do a
07:46 - livestream about show you project from
07:48 - the show as well and this reminds me
07:51 - another announcement that I would like
07:53 - to make in addition to teaching here at
07:55 - NYU in ITP I am also involved with the
07:58 - processing foundation you might be you
08:01 - might remember the processing foundation
08:03 - from such it's as p5.js or processing py
08:08 - but one thing I wanted to mention is the
08:11 - fellowship program the open call for the
08:13 - fellowships or 2018 is now live
08:16 - processing foundation is a
08:17 - not-for-profit we have a small limited
08:19 - budget and most of the things that we do
08:21 - are volunteer driven but this is one of
08:23 - the program
08:24 - run where we fund with a stipend
08:27 - speculative projects that can reimagine
08:30 - what processing can do as software and
08:32 - as a community so I encourage you to
08:36 - look at past fellowships you can see
08:39 - Cassie here who's the creator of the
08:40 - p5.js web editor Andrews also worked on
08:43 - the web at her DIY girls which is an
08:45 - organization in California got free -
08:49 - Justin Raspberry Pi stuff Nicholas who
08:52 - did some work in South Africa with kids
08:55 - who didn't have any experience with
08:56 - computers at all Saskia has been
08:58 - teaching stuff in London Susan who did a
09:00 - program about teaching p5 in prisons and
09:02 - these are even so previous ones Alison
09:05 - and Clare except so take a look at this
09:07 - you can see what kind of projects we've
09:08 - funded in the past and if you're
09:10 - interested in applying you can just
09:13 - click here and I believe it'll take you
09:14 - to a Google Form and hopefully most of
09:16 - that is self-explanatory but if you have
09:19 - questions about that you can reach out
09:21 - to me at Schiffman on twitter also at
09:23 - processing org is the official
09:26 - processing foundation twitter sometimes
09:32 - weird noises happen in here and i don't
09:34 - know if you hear them or just me but it
09:36 - was if somebody above me dropped a sort
09:38 - of like jar full of marbles like rolling
09:41 - around or else I'm losing my mind more
09:44 - than I already a.m. all right so what am
09:46 - I gonna do today apparently at some
09:48 - point I put all this stuff on this list
09:50 - so I would like to finish off I mean
09:53 - nothing is ever finished but I would
09:55 - like to at least complete what I had set
09:57 - out to do about Chrome extensions so I
10:00 - want to add I want to do a tutorial how
10:02 - that how to add a pop up to a Chrome
10:03 - extension I forgot what this is called
10:06 - somebody in the chat somebody in the
10:11 - chat actually okay Austin is giving me a
10:14 - good point I want to I should mention
10:15 - some things about the patreon rewards if
10:16 - people are curious Andre the chat asks
10:23 - do you have any good JavaScript
10:25 - tutorials well I definitely have
10:27 - JavaScript tutorials do I have good ones
10:30 - not so sure about that but if they have
10:32 - them and maybe you like them so yeah
10:35 - just just to answer a question here and
10:37 - everyone
10:37 - while I try to look at the live chat
10:38 - it's very difficult to follow but I
10:40 - might as well mention if you are a
10:42 - beginner and you've never programmed
10:43 - before there are plenty of resources
10:45 - beyond what I offer here on the coding
10:47 - train but the playlist you're looking
10:48 - for is this one foundations of
10:52 - programming in JavaScript so this is a
10:53 - playlist if I click on it oh no it's go
10:55 - surprise video I'm in an ad let's play a
10:59 - video for our new undergraduate program
11:01 - here it's very meta everything's very
11:03 - meta here but this is the playlist you
11:05 - want to look at there was something I
11:06 - wanted to mention about this which is if
11:08 - there's time today I need I want to
11:12 - continue yeah these videos these once I
11:18 - get to 7.6 I'm still using an older way
11:21 - of creating objects in JavaScript so I
11:22 - there's three to do videos here that I
11:26 - need to redo so I got to come back to
11:28 - that what was I talking about
11:31 - so the Chrome extension stuff I want to
11:33 - do on Twitter I'm gonna look up this
11:36 - tweet someone tweeted me very helpful
11:39 - information and you know it's it's my
11:41 - fault really just think about I you know
11:43 - the Chrome extensions is something that
11:44 - I encountered a while ago and used and
11:47 - talked with them but the concept of a
11:50 - browser extension beyond just simply the
11:52 - Chrome browser is a thing that exists
11:54 - and you can make extensions for other
11:55 - browsers in a more open way as well so I
11:57 - want to see if I can at least touch on
11:59 - that I want to revisit the current state
12:03 - of WebGL and p5 maybe do a little
12:05 - tutorial see how that is and moro P&J s
12:09 - and yeah definitely I term will be
12:11 - getting that very soon and and this is a
12:18 - new thing that I've been doing do I have
12:20 - this working I don't think I have this
12:23 - maybe I'll go through the steps to
12:25 - install this No so I'm really excited
12:27 - about machine learning ai stuff is
12:31 - coming to this channel I but what the
12:34 - two things I'm excited about one is I've
12:36 - been doing a lot of work recently with
12:39 - this library and
12:41 - in fact I met with the creators of the
12:44 - library yesterday
12:46 - Nikhil for at and Daniel smell cough who
12:48 - are amazing this is a JavaScript library
12:51 - for doing deep learning in the browser
12:52 - and I am working on a whole bunch of
12:54 - examples that I will go through and talk
12:56 - about on this channel very soon I'm
12:58 - gonna be updating a lot of my previous
13:00 - machine learning stuff using this
13:02 - library so that's coming the other thing
13:04 - that I have figured out to do which is
13:05 - kind of fun is any Python script torch
13:10 - script something that you can run and do
13:12 - via the command line I have a kind of a
13:15 - generic example for how to use nodejs to
13:18 - run that script and send the results to
13:20 - your p5 sketch so on the one hand I want
13:23 - to be able to do some of these
13:23 - algorithms right there in the browser
13:25 - themselves but if I need to run this
13:27 - algorithm as a separate script in a
13:28 - different programming language your
13:29 - environment I can use know to connect
13:31 - those two things so whether I get to
13:33 - that today or not is kind of an open
13:35 - question but that's my plan so that's my
13:40 - introduction 15 minutes I am going to I
13:45 - am going to now take the time at the
13:50 - beginning usually I say this for the end
13:52 - but I feel it's important to continue my
13:55 - work reading the entire book a million
13:59 - random digits with a hundred thousand
14:01 - normal deviates last time I made it
14:05 - through the forward I don't think I read
14:08 - the table of contents so I'm gonna read
14:11 - the table of contents right now I'm
14:14 - gonna move on contents page let me start
14:21 - over
14:23 - contents page acknowledgments seven
14:27 - introduction nine production of the
14:30 - random digits nine tests on the random
14:33 - digits eleven normal deviates fourteen
14:36 - use of the tables twenty table of random
14:40 - digits one through four hundred table of
14:44 - random normal devious one to two hundred
14:47 - pagination begins anew with
14:49 - table acknowledgments the following
14:54 - persons participated in the production
14:56 - testing and preparation for publication
14:58 - of the tables of random digits and the
15:01 - random normal deviates Paul Armour EC
15:04 - Bower mrs. Pernice Braun GW Braun Walter
15:08 - France
15:08 - JJ Goodpasture WF gunning sessile or
15:12 - Hastings Olaf Elmer ml Jim Cosa JD
15:18 - Madden am mood Artie Nash JD Williams
15:22 - these tables were prepared in connection
15:25 - with analyses done for the United States
15:27 - Air Force
15:28 - okay well the introduction is gonna be
15:30 - you know honestly the the interesting
15:32 - thing is like this stuff is like the
15:33 - stuff in the introduction is a really
15:35 - fascinating interesting stuff the men I
15:38 - get to the random members got to get to
15:40 - those random numbers all right put that
15:44 - over there ITP winter show somebody I
15:48 - just this was my bookmark I didn't put
15:50 - it in the book somebody will remind me
15:52 - next time
15:54 - so I'm being asked in the chat Austin
15:59 - says don't we usually do this part at
16:01 - the end yes we do but I feel it's
16:03 - important to emphasize the random
16:06 - numbers book and I want to maybe as a
16:08 - bookend today's episode I'll do it at
16:10 - the beginning on the end all right let
16:11 - me let me take this let me look at this
16:16 - chat here for a second okay so I'm gonna
16:22 - answer a couple questions Siyad o asks
16:26 - how much different is p5.js from regular
16:30 - javascript and this is an excellent
16:32 - question on the one hand oh and by the
16:36 - way while I'm answering this question if
16:38 - somebody can maybe even in the slack
16:39 - patron group could give me a screenshot
16:42 - of how I had the whiteboard about Chrome
16:44 - extensions at the end of last week's
16:46 - video I'm gonna need to unfortunately
16:48 - okay it's off recreate that cuz the
16:50 - whiteboard has been erased I left it
16:52 - there but other people use this room so
16:55 - so now first of all I do have a video I
16:59 - think it's something like the history of
17:02 - p5 or
17:03 - during p5 and processing I have a couple
17:05 - videos maybe they're under the QA
17:06 - playlist where I talk about some of the
17:08 - stuff a bit more in-depth perhaps but in
17:12 - a way I might say that comparing p5 in
17:15 - JavaScript is a flawed comparison so the
17:20 - thing to compare would be sort of more
17:21 - like comparing p5 and d3 or p5 and
17:25 - jQuery or p5 and 3j s because 3j s d3 p5
17:32 - jQuery many more things these are
17:34 - libraries for the language that is
17:36 - JavaScript so javascript is the
17:37 - programming language p5 is simply a
17:39 - library of stuff that you can import and
17:42 - use while you're programming in
17:44 - JavaScript the reason why that the
17:47 - question is quite valid though however
17:49 - is because what p5 does is simply wrap
17:53 - or alter or provide a simpler smaller
17:58 - syntax for some of the things you might
18:00 - do in JavaScript natively meaning with
18:03 - just what the sort of like language
18:04 - provides in the browser for you by
18:06 - default mostly around drawing to a
18:08 - canvas so and it's meant to be more
18:13 - beginner friendly and easy to get up and
18:15 - running with that valuing sort of like
18:19 - emphasizing that over kind of longer
18:23 - scalable larger software projects that
18:26 - require a lot more strict ways of
18:28 - putting things together so that's that's
18:30 - what I would say is kind of an answer to
18:32 - that
18:33 - so Austin is also asking me to mention
18:38 - the Google forum so I you know I don't
18:41 - want to overemphasize the patreon stuff
18:42 - but I am finally getting around to
18:44 - sending rewards out for everybody who
18:46 - joined in 2016-17 I got the year
18:54 - it's 2017 everybody it's like the end of
18:58 - 2017 I've gotten everybody who joined in
19:00 - 2016 I think I think yes that's been
19:03 - that was done at the end of last year so
19:05 - you should have got if you're a patron
19:07 - you should got an email with a Google
19:10 - Form if you already filled out a Google
19:12 - Form then you didn't get an email
19:13 - because I have your
19:13 - nation already if for some reason you
19:16 - think that your should get something but
19:18 - you haven't or did get a form just send
19:20 - me I know right so now I have this
19:21 - whiteboard image and I'm going to zoom
19:24 - in on it and I'm gonna come over here
19:27 - and I'm gonna try to recreate it so I
19:30 - probably should have done this so what's
19:32 - the main thing we need for a Google Form
19:37 - Chrome extension I don't know I think my
19:40 - brain is misfiring more and more every
19:42 - day somebody should do unlike scientific
19:44 - study of the vocabularies doing over
19:47 - time content script last week I did some
19:53 - tutorials on content scripts and we had
20:00 - something we had a file called content
20:02 - j/s I also looked at background scripts
20:12 - and I called that background dot je s I
20:21 - don't like this marker let's try a
20:23 - different one actions browser action
20:26 - page action I talked about actions
20:36 - browser action page action actually I
20:43 - think I might not I'm gonna have erased
20:46 - that since last week because I'm gonna
20:49 - actually put popups down here so you
20:53 - know what I could do is like add over
20:54 - here like browser actions the browser
20:58 - action is like you you hit a button in
21:01 - the browser you can listen for that in
21:02 - the background script I had a little
21:05 - diagram a silly diagram of the browser
21:08 - itself which looks something like this
21:15 - and I think I said something like
21:17 - content and button like button so I
21:31 - think this is fine to start with so the
21:34 - other thing I would love for people to
21:35 - think about as I sort of move into
21:37 - looking at what a pop-up is and how you
21:39 - do a pop-up I would love to get some
21:43 - ideas for like so I want to do the same
21:46 - thing I did last week which is just kind
21:47 - of do some standard regular tutorials
21:51 - and that would be just how to put a
21:54 - pop-up how to communicate between a
21:56 - pop-up and a content script and we'll
21:59 - see if I want to do the tab over and a
22:00 - tab over right I definitely want to do
22:02 - that so I want to do those things and
22:03 - then what I would like to do is like
22:05 - come up with some very simple scenarios
22:07 - like I had the kitten eyes our thing I
22:09 - had the doodler thing so I want to do
22:12 - like maybe one or two Chrome extension
22:15 - challenges mostly when I asked for this
22:17 - the things people give me are like
22:18 - really complicated elaborate project
22:21 - ideas that's what I want you to make it
22:23 - doesn't be complicated but I want to
22:25 - make really simple quick projects that
22:27 - are kind of ridiculous and useless to
22:30 - help inspire you to make things from
22:32 - those all right so all right so I think
22:44 - I'm good to go with the pop-up thing if
22:46 - you wouldn't mind indulging me for a
22:49 - second I would love to just like look at
22:53 - some of my examples
22:54 - oops so if you're so one thing I failed
22:58 - to get the code from last week uploaded
23:01 - I'm meant to try to get this afternoon
23:03 - so at least could say like I upload it
23:04 - but I didn't get to so apologies for
23:07 - that I will make sure soon to have all
23:10 - the code from the tutorials from last
23:12 - week and from today uploaded on github
23:14 - but what I want to show you is I also
23:17 - have a lot of Chrome extensions first of
23:19 - all
23:21 - I have a write-up by the way if anyone
23:25 - wants to this this is this page this
23:28 - website this is where I have tutorials
23:31 - for one of my courses if anybody wants
23:35 - to give me a pull request this page to
23:38 - fix up anything that's their point to
23:40 - new examples embed my YouTube videos
23:43 - that I published in the appropriate
23:44 - place on this page I mean I'm gonna get
23:45 - to this at some point but I would accept
23:47 - the pull request it's github.com slash
23:50 - Schiffman slash Schiffman net you can
23:53 - find this is a github pages site that
23:54 - uses Jekyll so you have to kind of see
23:56 - how that works but I would love help
23:59 - with that what I'm looking for is where
24:02 - I have the stuff on messaging I have
24:07 - pop-ups so this this is how I do a
24:12 - pop-up I give it an HTML page and then
24:19 - what I want to look at then a lot of
24:20 - these examples are here in my a to z
24:22 - course and I just wanted to see pop-up
24:25 - messaging how did I do this between
24:29 - pop-up and the content script
24:32 - so this searches for the end just sends
24:35 - a message so it's the same thing that
24:36 - you do in a background script but you
24:38 - send it from the pop-up great okay so
24:40 - I'm gonna do this alright okay any yeah
24:55 - so there's a good clarification thing
24:57 - I'm gonna read this comment also from
24:58 - Austin it might be worth mentioning when
25:00 - you make a Chrome extension the
25:02 - background script and the pop-up scripts
25:04 - essentially run in their own individual
25:06 - environments and this I didn't mention
25:07 - to st. in those words but this is why
25:11 - when I look at the Chrome extensions
25:13 - page and I want to debug something if I
25:18 - want to debug the background script I'm
25:20 - gonna have to go and open a console
25:22 - through here the separate environment
25:23 - and it doesn't know anything about the
25:25 - content page only the content page does
25:28 - so having an extension enabled is the
25:31 - equivalent of having one or two tabs
25:32 - console
25:33 - open so having a lot of extensions
25:36 - running can slow things down ziz a good
25:38 - point okay
25:42 - so um I'm not gonna be able to follow
25:46 - any suggestions that are in the YouTube
25:51 - chat Amir might catch one so if anybody
25:53 - sees something good who if you're in the
25:55 - if you're in the patron group and you
25:56 - see something you can paste it in the
25:58 - slack chat or you can tweet your
25:59 - suggestions too at the coding train I
26:04 - think I think I'm logged in as that so I
26:06 - can look at my notifications so if you
26:10 - have a suggestion for who this is a nice
26:11 - there's some nice things okay if you
26:13 - have a suggestion you can you can tweet
26:15 - it to me here and I will take a look at
26:16 - it alright I think maybe oh boy did I
26:25 - really just talk for a half an hour I
26:26 - think maybe we're ready to begin what's
26:33 - interesting to me is like I can easily
26:35 - imagine a live stream that happens you
26:38 - know every week or something that's just
26:40 - like a half an hour long I manage to
26:43 - just talk for a half an hour like how
26:46 - I'm about to do something so apologies
26:49 - for that mono deep in the chat asked do
26:53 - you have any nodejs tutorials I have a
26:54 - whole bunch of nodejs tutorials I wish
26:56 - there was a really perfect and great way
26:58 - that I could organize everything so you
26:59 - can find it instantly you just have to
27:01 - poke through my different playlists on
27:02 - on YouTube alright let's let's remember
27:07 - our sponsor on the coding tree hydrogen
27:14 - dioxide hmm at oxygen stuff with the
27:22 - hydrogen stuff I mean you got to get it
27:25 - mixed in a certain way precisely
27:27 - otherwise you could really run into
27:28 - trouble but it is quite good alright
27:36 - yeah I'm being asked will you make a
27:38 - tutorial about how to make a Firefox
27:39 - extension I would like to to be honest
27:41 - with you I've never done that before so
27:43 - I might may get more of like I don't
27:44 - know tutorials the right word
27:46 - but I'm gonna attempt to do one if we
27:47 - have time today
27:49 - [Music]
27:51 - dihydrogen oxide I said that wrong
27:53 - didn't I oh my god hold on I totally
27:56 - said that wrong
27:57 - how embarrassing and then h2o Wikipedia
28:05 - yeah the two is oh my god I don't even
28:10 - want to I don't even I don't even I
28:12 - don't let's let's just move off of this
28:14 - topic immediately oh no I was right
28:23 - you're talking bout something else I
28:24 - don't know what's going on anymore can
28:25 - we please move up I don't know anything
28:26 - about a chemistry it's chemistry right
28:29 - that's the correct subject do I own a
28:32 - clothing store I do not but I do have
28:35 - [Music]
28:38 - look cool this is live right I can't
28:43 - just like go back in time anymore let's
28:45 - let's do some pop-ups let's let's think
28:48 - about kids
28:54 - yes kids thank you very much kittens and
28:57 - rainbows and cupcakes notice that I hide
29:01 - [Music]
29:04 - all right so uh huh thank you thank you
29:08 - very much everybody
29:09 - this has been the coding train
29:11 - introduction I think I gotta go
29:14 - now many 8:06 will be by again hello
29:34 - this is another video in my series about
29:37 - Chrome extensions which you know right
29:40 - now I just want to say at the beginning
29:41 - of this video I hope to actually turn
29:44 - this playlist into something that's
29:45 - instead of saying Chrome extensions just
29:47 - say browser extensions because that is
29:50 - something that is quite possible beyond
29:51 - simply the browser chrome but I'm gonna
29:53 - stick with Chrome right now as I work
29:55 - through all the details so what am I
29:58 - going to add in this particular video
30:00 - well as you can see here in my diagram
30:04 - the over there anymore my monitor is now
30:07 - blocked by something else as you can see
30:08 - in my diagram here I have talked about
30:10 - content scripts and background scripts
30:12 - and what I'm going to add today is
30:14 - something called a pop-up so a pop-up is
30:19 - a page that you can launch that's
30:21 - essentially like an overlay of what
30:23 - what's in the browser at the certain and
30:25 - a certain moment and I can launch it via
30:28 - a browser action for example clicking a
30:31 - button that I have in the top over here
30:33 - I can press that button and I can have
30:35 - some sort of pop-up come up so I could
30:37 - do things like I could have an interface
30:39 - where I could change colors or make
30:41 - selections or or type in a word that I
30:43 - want to look up I can augment the
30:46 - browsing experience through a separate
30:48 - pop-up page that is that as part of my
30:50 - Chrome extension so that's what we're
30:52 - gonna make in this tutorial I'm now
30:55 - going to walk over here and then I just
30:59 - realized I don't have anything prepared
31:02 - code wise I'm so I got a this look this
31:06 - will be an edit point so I'm gonna go
31:10 - here Chrome extensions backgrounds grip
31:13 - let's
31:14 - let's stick with that one whoops
31:19 - ah so I'm gonna do oh five pop-ups and
31:31 - one thing I want to do is just fix this
31:34 - button because I think this button had
31:36 - all this transparency associated I'm
31:39 - just gonna hold on
31:43 - this is very important work that I'm
31:44 - doing I'm going to crop this image it's
31:49 - very important that I do this okay and
31:54 - then I'm going to look I'm gonna I'm
31:57 - gonna delete these extensions and I'm
32:02 - going to change I'm gonna open up Adam
32:10 - and I'm gonna close these and I'm gonna
32:15 - go to pop ups a background script which
32:22 - I don't need just to have a pop up I
32:24 - don't need a background script so I'm
32:26 - going to take out the background script
32:32 - this content script just changes when I
32:38 - press the button I'm gonna so I'm gonna
32:39 - take this out I'm gonna leave this in
32:44 - here huh maybe I should do this in hold
32:48 - on I'm gonna actually do this in the
32:51 - tutorial cuz I'm gonna start with the
32:52 - one that I had last so let me put that
32:56 - back and here so I'm going to change the
33:00 - browser action to a pop-up okay
33:12 - I should really switch to visual studio
33:19 - yeah probably oh there's this teletype
33:21 - thing for Adam have you have you all
33:23 - seen this we should try it looks very
33:25 - dangerous forbids it allows everybody to
33:27 - only collaboratively edit the same file
33:28 - which I'd love to do but I have a
33:30 - feeling that I will get some serious
33:33 - trolling in if I let just like open that
33:35 - up to anybody so I'm not so sure how to
33:38 - approach that all right so I'm gonna
33:41 - call this coatings train extension 3 and
33:48 - I'm gonna hit refresh and I'm going to
33:53 - come back over here and alright I'm
33:56 - going to I can leave these things open
33:59 - that's fine here all right
34:04 - and now ok so what I'm gonna do is I'm
34:13 - gonna start with the code that I had at
34:14 - the end of my background script tutorial
34:16 - which if we look at already made a copy
34:20 - of it into a new folder which I'm
34:21 - calling pop-ups which you can find a
34:24 - link to this code for the tutorial in
34:25 - the description as usual and what i'm
34:30 - what i have is that manifest.json file
34:32 - so i've already changed it to coding
34:33 - train extension 3 maybe I'll say you
34:35 - know I'll changes the coding train
34:37 - pop-up it is like the content script is
34:41 - available for all URLs in the background
34:45 - strip now interestingly enough I
34:46 - actually don't need a background script
34:48 - just to have a pop-up like I might need
34:50 - a background script for something else
34:51 - that's going on in my extension but I
34:53 - don't need it just for the pop-up so I
34:54 - think just for simplicity in this
34:56 - particular tutorial I'm gonna take out
34:58 - the background script and I'm actually
35:00 - going to just delete the file that is
35:02 - the background so actual you know what
35:03 - I'm gonna leave it there because
35:04 - eventually one thing that I'm gonna want
35:07 - to do is if you recall a way that I sent
35:11 - a message the way that I controlled the
35:13 - content script or made an event happen
35:16 - the contract script from the background
35:17 - script was sending a message and
35:19 - actually what I probably going to want
35:21 - to do now is set
35:22 - message from the pop-up to the content
35:23 - script so the code that's in the
35:25 - background script is going to become
35:26 - useful for me because I can use that
35:27 - same code in the pop-up alright so but
35:33 - when there's a browser action I want
35:35 - there to be something more I want there
35:37 - to be a default pop-up no it's not
35:43 - written over there what I'm supposed to
35:45 - type right here I just looked over there
35:46 - because there was something interesting
35:47 - happening I'm putting notes over there
35:50 - and I want this to be now can I make
35:53 - that in another folder let's try this
35:56 - and I want to try do is make the pop-up
35:58 - of entire Pete let's actually first just
36:00 - make an HTML page so I'm gonna just call
36:02 - it pop-up HTML and I think I need to say
36:07 - oh I don't need to but I can say default
36:11 - title and this will appear in like the
36:15 - tooltips like a pop-up will come here
36:19 - alright so I think that is now some
36:23 - stuff that I can add to now have a
36:25 - pop-up now what this means is there
36:27 - needs to be an HTML page called pop-up
36:29 - that HTML so I'm gonna make that file
36:31 - pop-up dot HTML and I'm just gonna I
36:35 - mean I should I don't really know you
36:37 - need all this stuff in the HTML page but
36:39 - let's just put basically like something
36:41 - really basic there right now just to say
36:44 - like no I know
36:49 - choo choo okay so this is this page I
36:54 - want to see pop-up when I press that
36:56 - button in the browser okay here we go
36:58 - so now what do I need to do remember I
37:01 - need to load the code and it'll load
37:03 - that extension oh five pop-ups this is
37:06 - the one I'm gonna select the whole
37:07 - folder I'm gonna hit select no errors
37:10 - occurred in the loading of this
37:12 - extension so it should be fine now I can
37:15 - go to any page I just happen to be going
37:17 - to my coding train I mean my chrome
37:20 - extension tutorial page I'll go there
37:23 - now look I should be able to see this
37:24 - button right here this is my button the
37:26 - reason why it has that image is because
37:28 - I included the default icon to be this
37:30 - PNG file and if I click there look at
37:33 - that
37:33 - there's my pop-up
37:38 - [Applause]
37:39 - it can't have a giant to chew right
37:42 - there and not use the train whistle all
37:45 - right so we see that the pop ups work
37:48 - now let's try to do something a little
37:50 - bit more interesting with the pop up let
37:51 - me see if I can put an animation there
37:53 - something let's see if I can put a whole
37:54 - p5 sketch there so let's try that so
37:58 - what I want to do I'm going to just work
38:00 - with the file system for a second like
38:02 - let me see if I can do I'm gonna make a
38:04 - folder called sketch and then what I'm
38:06 - gonna do is I'm going to I'm gonna
38:09 - actually delete pop-up dot HTML we saw
38:12 - that that worked I'm going to pause for
38:15 - a second and come back in a second and
38:19 - we need to find a p5 sketch so let me
38:24 - what's a good example p5 sketch like the
38:26 - flocking one for example for like no
38:30 - good reason other than why not right so
38:32 - where do I have do I have a nature of
38:35 - code examples on this computer examples
38:42 - - p5 seriously do not have a nature of
38:46 - code examples - p5 let's go get that
38:50 - github.com / Schiffman / the nature of
38:59 - code examples
39:01 - - p5.js that is clone this repository oh
39:10 - the morphing circle that is a good one
39:13 - oh yeah I should probably do something
39:14 - from a code previous coding challenge so
39:16 - it's a better idea
39:17 - thank you good suggestion so where is
39:21 - where do I keep that let's look for the
39:26 - rainbow code repository I must have it
39:29 - somewhere on this computer
39:30 - oops
39:37 - and let me Oh in my other it's in a
39:42 - different that's this is gonna be a
39:44 - problem is it really gonna let me do
39:45 - this there's no way it's gonna let me do
39:47 - this yeah because I'm not like earth
39:50 - this is so ridiculous boy am I really
39:55 - making this I'm over doing this now just
40:02 - like go rainbow there's a song anyway I
40:04 - don't know what my computer is showing
40:06 - me let's that's gonna be good enough so
40:11 - let's go to coding challenges and let's
40:15 - find what's a good one from here the
40:19 - morphing let's try one of the games like
40:36 - am I having technical issues uh I should
40:42 - just done the flocking thing I don't
40:43 - know why now I got nine I get myself
40:45 - feeling crazy like I have to decide what
40:49 - is this a fractal tree in p5 yeah I mean
40:51 - let's try this let's just get this one
40:55 - okay I like the maze generator let's do
41:02 - that because it's I'm kind of curious
41:04 - that it has like all this stuff in it
41:06 - let's do that desktop desktop Chrome
41:14 - extensions pop-ups
41:24 - I'm just gonna really quickly just gonna
41:33 - really quickly
41:35 - run a server just so I can make sure
41:36 - that example works whoa did I just name
41:48 - the folder
41:48 - I meant to name this folder sketch not
41:51 - to get shot yes and here we go all right
42:01 - all right so this does work something
42:07 - horrible has happened though which is
42:09 - that I think it kept the file extension
42:14 - those computers are so silly because
42:19 - it's still in a folder called sketch j/s
42:22 - Oh everything's gonna be ok everybody
42:26 - I'm gonna manage this I'm gonna manage
42:29 - this I am going to make this happen I
42:33 - can do it I can put everything where I
42:36 - want it to be I can fix things that are
42:40 - named in weird ways for no reason and
42:44 - there we go ok so now the goal is when I
42:47 - click the button to have the maze pop-up
42:52 - let's see if we can make that work all
42:56 - right so where was I this tutorial was
43:03 - somewhere lost all right
43:09 - and I'm back now what I have done in
43:14 - that very long amount of time wait
43:16 - longer than should taken me is I have
43:18 - grabbed one of my previous examples from
43:20 - a coding challenge that generates a maze
43:22 - and I have put all of the code for that
43:24 - coding challenge in a folder called
43:25 - sketch so now what I want is for the
43:30 - pop-up to display that example let's
43:33 - just look at that example what that
43:34 - example does I've got that example also
43:36 - just running here in the browser let me
43:40 - just quickly go to that so this is the
43:42 - example it it generates a maze using a
43:45 - particular algorithm that I used a long
43:47 - time ago in to challenge so what I want
43:48 - is when I click this the files not there
43:52 - anymore I want to see that maze
43:54 - okay here we go we're gonna make this
43:55 - happen so what do I do what I have to do
43:58 - is this file doesn't exist anymore I
44:01 - deleted it
44:01 - what I need to do is here the default
44:05 - pop-up should be sketch slash index.html
44:12 - so the question is is that enough if I
44:16 - just point to that page that's in the
44:18 - sketch folder will it work or do I need
44:22 - to do something more to reference the
44:26 - different JavaScript files and libraries
44:27 - and things that I'm using let's find out
44:30 - and then I'm going to change oh let me
44:33 - just show you that here we should see we
44:35 - should say generate a maze that's going
44:40 - to be the message the little tooltip
44:43 - message when you hover over the button
44:44 - so I need to go and reload the Chrome
44:47 - extension and it doesn't actually really
44:49 - matter what page I'm on but I'm a stick
44:51 - on this page if I hover over here you
44:55 - should see right I'm getting that
44:56 - generate a maze message and then I
45:01 - worked so that was actually quite easy
45:04 - so you can see here I have the maze
45:08 - generating in the pop-up and
45:10 - interestingly enough let me press that
45:11 - but goes away is it gonna pause and
45:15 - continue from where it was before
45:17 - is it gonna start over had it already
45:19 - been running for a while when I first
45:20 - clicked it I'd even notice let's look
45:22 - again let's see
45:23 - interesting it started over so notice
45:26 - this is very important this is a page
45:29 - that's being loaded fresh each time
45:33 - every time you click it's not a page
45:35 - that's running and being hidden and then
45:37 - revealed it's actually a new page that's
45:39 - being loaded which brings up another
45:41 - question how do i D bug something that's
45:44 - happening on the pop-up is there
45:47 - something here
45:50 - nope whoops so let's add a console dot
45:53 - log into the pop-up this is actually all
45:57 - of that code and I'm just going to say
46:00 - console dot log frame count so this is
46:05 - what I would log typically in a p5
46:07 - sketch if I wanted to just see that it
46:09 - was running it should say 0 1 2 3 4 5
46:11 - counting every single frame so now I'm
46:15 - gonna reload the extension I'm going to
46:18 - refresh over here and I'm going to click
46:21 - the button so where is it logging that
46:23 - well let's look in the JavaScript
46:25 - console let's try clicking the button
46:27 - again it's over my console let me try it
46:33 - again
46:33 - no so notice how this is not where the
46:38 - only the content script is playing a
46:41 - role in the actual content page this
46:44 - pop-up is just information so this video
46:46 - is about the end because I'm kind of at
46:48 - the end of it but I need to do something
46:50 - what I want to show is how you can have
46:52 - the content script send a message I'm
46:54 - sorry
46:55 - the pop-up send a message because
46:56 - ultimately maybe I want to build an
46:57 - interface there where I you know I made
47:00 - a Chrome extension where I do it along
47:01 - the page so maybe I can like pick a
47:03 - color or change the line thickness that
47:05 - type of thing so I'm gonna get to that
47:06 - in the next video but I at least want to
47:08 - figure out where I can debug this stuff
47:09 - let's go back to here
47:13 - Wow I expected to see it here pause look
47:17 - at the chat where do I where do I see
47:19 - the right click on the pop-up and you
47:23 - have the console for debugging oh that's
47:25 - what I need to do or is it even
47:29 - something that I could do here oh this
47:31 - is where I could do it whoops
47:35 - so this is actually where I want to do
47:37 - it right no inspect I guess I need a
47:45 - whole separate I need to get it here
47:48 - alright great so that's what I'm going
47:49 - to do so the interesting no I would have
47:52 - assumed oh maybe I wonder what this is
47:54 - here but let's put it back and where was
48:04 - I did I already just look I think I just
48:09 - looked over here but do that again just
48:10 - in case I didn't alright so where we've
48:15 - established that it's not here in the
48:17 - console I don't see any console dot log
48:21 - if I look here this is where I would
48:24 - have a console log for a background
48:26 - script but I don't have a background
48:28 - script this is a pop-up I don't see it
48:30 - there where is it so actually thank you
48:32 - to the chat who clued me in on this I'm
48:35 - going to press this button here and I'm
48:37 - going to right click and if I
48:39 - right-click I now see I have this option
48:41 - called inspect and I can select that and
48:44 - it's going to bring up another window I
48:46 - can go over to console so this is the
48:48 - JavaScript console for the pop-up
48:50 - there's a JavaScript console for the
48:53 - page content page there's a JavaScript
48:55 - console for the background script and
48:57 - now there's a JavaScript console for
48:59 - this particular pop-up
49:01 - okay so I've shown you how to add a
49:03 - pop-up you can do this anything that you
49:05 - can put on a web page can be in a pop-up
49:07 - you could start querying api's and
49:10 - drawing maps and doing anything in that
49:12 - pop-up so what I want to do in the next
49:14 - video is show you how to send a message
49:16 - from the pop-up to the content script
49:20 - and change something in the interface by
49:23 - what you're doing in the pop-up and I
49:25 - kind of have I have an idea for that
49:26 - okay hold on hold on we might have some
49:30 - breaking news
49:32 - default console.log comes from content
49:34 - scripts for publishers alone scope yeah
49:37 - yeah yes okay all right so now next up
49:53 - almost finished with this coffee here
49:56 - what we're gonna do when it's all done
49:57 - just drink water coding that coding
50:04 - train pop-up thing looks red I'm not
50:10 - sure what that's referring to Simon but
50:12 - alright so thank you potato cool I love
50:18 - all these crazy names that appear in the
50:20 - chat so a little woozy a very big lunch
50:24 - today I think that's it's not good for
50:26 - when it starts to approach five o'clock
50:31 - so what I want to do I need to talk a
50:35 - little bit about scope so let me think
50:44 - what I'm gonna do here the content
50:48 - script in the example just changed the
50:50 - content of paragraph elements I mean I
50:54 - think an interesting code a couple
50:55 - coding challenges could be take my
50:58 - doodle example and like change the
51:01 - thickness of what you're drawing
51:04 - actually didn't publish that video I
51:06 - just rose I didn't publish that video
51:08 - yet it's there in the playlist if you
51:11 - want to find it but it's just not a made
51:12 - public yet another option would be I
51:16 - mean I have this idea of doing something
51:17 - today that's a Chrome extension for
51:19 - Twitter mostly like can we fix Twitter
51:22 - like basically just make a Chrome
51:24 - extension that erases everybody's tweets
51:26 - and you only see like nice messages to
51:28 - people that's an idea and maybe then
51:32 - they pop up you could like type in your
51:33 - messages oh I know what I'm going to do
51:35 - so what I'm gonna do is I think what
51:38 - this did right is it made this Chrome
51:43 - extension what I had before is it
51:45 - changes the inner H it made everything
51:49 - or whatever the background color but I
51:51 - can change the innerhtml
51:53 - to whatever you're typing in the pop-up
51:54 - so we're gonna do that that's gonna
51:56 - that's what I'm gonna do
52:00 - yeah the pop-up just by default gets the
52:03 - automatic document body with or whatever
52:06 - the page width and kind of sizes it that
52:08 - way at least turn the doodle thing on
52:09 - and off that's a great idea
52:11 - Simon so you know these all these ideas
52:14 - one of my reasons for being here is not
52:16 - to do all the ideas but to have other
52:18 - people do the ideas but that is perfect
52:19 - that's a great that's a great thing okay
52:21 - so let me move on now and go on so oops
52:34 - I'm definitely gonna need a short break
52:37 - at some point to get some more water
52:39 - it's because I talked about well where
52:47 - am I here okay okay I'm back in another
52:57 - video about pop-ups what I did in the
53:00 - previous video is I just made something
53:02 - a page pop-up when I press the button in
53:06 - the Chrome extension you know what it's
53:20 - really bugging me I don't know what it
53:22 - looks like for a broadcast on YouTube
53:24 - but I'm getting some weird like moiré
53:27 - pattern thing it's driving me crazy so I
53:29 - just want to change the width to like 50
53:33 - or maybe 40 is actually 40 is better I
53:38 - need to reload the extension there we go
53:42 - okay interestingly enough it's like kind
53:47 - of and then I'm going to hold I just
53:50 - want to like clean this up a little bit
53:55 - here we go that's a little bit a little
53:57 - bit better all right sorry all right
54:08 - pop-up this is another video I just
54:11 - thought of that right now oh I'm such a
54:13 - not genius when it comes to bad jokes on
54:16 - the internet and I also think like I
54:18 - hurt my back the other day anyway here I
54:19 - am in another video about popups in
54:22 - Chrome extension so in the previous
54:23 - video
54:24 - all I showed you how to do was if you
54:27 - add a browser action with a button when
54:30 - you click that button you can have a web
54:33 - page pop-up and in this case I have an
54:35 - entire p5.js sketch animating as part of
54:38 - the pop-up but why would I want to have
54:41 - a pop-up well one of the reasons why I
54:42 - would want to have a pop-up is to
54:44 - provide an interface for my Chrome
54:46 - extension that might change some
54:47 - settings to have some place where I
54:49 - could enter some information to to show
54:51 - something related to what's on the web
54:54 - page that I'm on so in order for that to
54:57 - actually happen I need to have some way
55:00 - of communicating between the content and
55:04 - the pop-up now one thing that's
55:08 - important about Chrome extension I
55:10 - haven't actually used the word scope but
55:12 - I think it's to mention this before when
55:15 - I wanted to communicate between the
55:17 - background script and the content script
55:19 - they live in different scopes each one
55:22 - of these things lives in its own bubble
55:25 - the background script the pop-up the
55:29 - background script the pop-up the content
55:30 - script all in their own separate bubble
55:34 - so only the content script is allowed to
55:38 - mess around and know about what's on the
55:41 - content page
55:42 - the pop-up knows nothing about that and
55:45 - it's not as if you could just make a
55:47 - global variable and use the same
55:49 - variable in both places their different
55:51 - scopes there's sort of a trick to
55:53 - getting variables from the background
55:54 - script but that's another story
55:56 - now so what do you I need to do is I
56:00 - need to have a way of sending messages
56:02 - back and forth in very similar to how
56:04 - you might do this in a networked
56:05 - application I have this thing running
56:07 - over here and this thing running over
56:08 - the air I'm gonna send a message over
56:10 - here to make this thing happen that's
56:11 - what he did to do the nice thing is the
56:13 - API the set of functions that I
56:15 - showed in a previous video for how to
56:17 - communicate from the background script
56:18 - to the content script I can use that
56:21 - same functionality to communicate from
56:22 - the pop-up to the content script so what
56:25 - I think I'm gonna try to do let's come
56:26 - back over here is first time to get rid
56:29 - of this maze thing it's kind of
56:31 - interesting but I'm gonna I'm gonna go
56:32 - into my p5 sketch I'm just gonna kind of
56:35 - delete everything and I'm gonna have
56:39 - some extra JavaScript that I don't need
56:40 - I'm gonna delete that I'm gonna delete
56:42 - this extra file here this does not need
56:45 - to be in this video and I'm so I'm gonna
56:48 - go to sketch J yes and I'm just gonna
56:50 - say function setup and function draw and
56:56 - I'm gonna I'm gonna say no canvas and
57:02 - I'm going to put some elements on the
57:04 - page like I don't need this anymore I
57:07 - don't need the sound library oh that's
57:08 - interesting that I could have sounds I'm
57:11 - gonna put some elements on the page so
57:12 - I'm gonna say type paragraph replacer
57:19 - and then I'm going to make an input
57:23 - element with an ID called user input I
57:28 - know is that how you do it do I need to
57:32 - close it like that or just put a slash
57:34 - let me in something like that I'm gonna
57:35 - put that in like a paragraph then what
57:41 - I'm gonna do
57:41 - oh let's see this is this this looks
57:44 - weird but I feel like I messed something
57:45 - up here but I'm just gonna leave it then
57:48 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to
57:50 - reload my extension and I'm gonna press
57:52 - the pop-up I say okay so now I have this
57:55 - paragraph replacer what I want to do is
57:57 - anything I type here I'm going to
57:59 - replace the content on the webpage with
58:02 - anything I type there just as a
58:03 - demonstration of how you can communicate
58:05 - between the two and remember I could
58:07 - send from the content script so one
58:09 - thing I might like to do for example is
58:11 - I actually have an example so I'll link
58:13 - to that from here is what if I'm on a
58:15 - webpage and I like select a word and
58:18 - then I press this I'm gonna make this as
58:21 - a coding challenge so I select a word on
58:24 - the webpage I press the button and it
58:26 - goes to an API like word Nick
58:28 - and finds me the definition for that
58:29 - page so we'll do that as a coding
58:31 - challenge in maybe that in the next
58:32 - video actually but in this video I'm
58:33 - gonna do something simple and I just
58:35 - need to have this messaging go back and
58:37 - forth so how do I do that first let me
58:41 - just weirdly make sure messaging works
58:43 - and I'm going to actually no no let's I
58:47 - don't need to draw loop there's no
58:49 - animation happening you could have an
58:51 - animation what I want to do is I want to
58:53 - say user input equals select so I'm
58:57 - using the p5 Dom library to grab that
59:02 - element and then and that says user put
59:04 - user input then I want to use the user
59:07 - input dot input there are two events
59:11 - that can be associated with a textbox
59:13 - one is the event called changed which
59:15 - only happens when I like press enter or
59:19 - tab out of that I could maybe have a
59:22 - submit button or something but I'm
59:23 - actually just gonna do it as I'm typing
59:25 - so the input event is an event that
59:26 - happens every time I press a key so I'm
59:29 - gonna say pressed you know user key
59:34 - pressed oh boy terrible name for a
59:37 - function I can't even tolerate it
59:39 - new text will call this new text so I'm
59:41 - gonna write a function called new text
59:43 - and here now I want to send a message to
59:50 - the content script so all I'm gonna do
59:54 - now to make sure this is working is send
59:56 - a message with what's in like this is
59:58 - the message user input values so
60:03 - whatever is in that text input box
60:05 - that's going to be the message so I
60:08 - content script actually a hole ready has
60:13 - code to receive a message
60:15 - it already has code to receive a message
60:17 - because that's what I had in a previous
60:18 - example and I actually don't need to
60:20 - change it I do need to think about how
60:23 - I'm gonna format that message
60:24 - my background script that I did in a
60:26 - previous video has the code to send a
60:28 - message this is how I send a message now
60:33 - the thing is how do I get the current
60:36 - tabs ID so this isn't going to work
60:40 - exactly let me move
60:42 - into here the idea that I'm gonna do
60:45 - here is right now I'm gonna craft the
60:48 - message as a JavaScript object then I'm
60:51 - gonna send that message to the tabs that
60:53 - tab that I'm currently on I could
60:55 - actually send it to other tabs but if I
60:56 - send it to the tab that I'm currently on
60:58 - how do I get the tab that I'm currently
61:00 - on look up how to do that I have it in
61:04 - an example I'm like where would be the
61:06 - document to pause for a second I'm
61:13 - looking I'm looking in the chat to see
61:14 - if someone just wants to tell me where
61:16 - the document - oh this computer went
61:18 - awry let's let's see if I have any okay
61:22 - so oh this is not scroll that shot is
61:25 - not scrolling here I don't need the
61:27 - input call it change text these are all
61:30 - like much better yeah oh these are also
61:39 - much better suggestions all right so
61:41 - what I'm looking for is okay let me look
61:43 - at my example first but I'm rather look
61:47 - [Music]
61:51 - let me look in my example and in my
61:55 - example pop-up messaging how did I get
62:00 - it
62:01 - oh I have to query for the tab look at
62:07 - that I have to query for the tab all
62:10 - right so tabs dot query params active
62:15 - true current window true and then I have
62:17 - to query and then I get the tabs back
62:19 - all right all right that's interesting
62:23 - so let's see where would that be that
62:27 - would be chrome tabs API this is it
62:42 - so just just so I understand correctly
62:46 - I'm gonna correct this I don't even need
62:50 - this anymore like I should just do this
62:56 - so just like this is more correct all
62:59 - right I will get rid of that I will get
63:00 - rid of that in a little bit why is my my
63:03 - monitor is like lagging behind me it's
63:06 - kind of freaking me out
63:08 - it's when I do something it like happens
63:11 - oh this is so weird
63:14 - wait wait wait I'm in real time I think
63:17 - what are you guys seeing a delay with my
63:19 - typing like watch this I'm pressing a
63:24 - and then it appears pressing a are you
63:29 - guys seeing that delay or am I just
63:30 - seeing this delay in a preview oh I'm
63:38 - really getting stuck on something
63:40 - indentation is off I have a feeling it's
63:43 - off because of this or maybe this what
63:48 - did I miss
63:50 - there's a little delay it's not really
63:52 - bugging anybody too much right the delay
63:54 - I probably shouldn't worry about fixing
63:55 - that right now yeah I see everybody fuge
64:03 - delay so let me know in the if the delay
64:07 - is actually an issue or if it's like
64:10 - everything you can follow everything
64:11 - that I'm doing even with that delay okay
64:19 - I know the indentation is off but oh
64:23 - yeah we fix that um that's gonna make
64:26 - people crazy all right okay wait so
64:38 - query Oh get actually you could just use
64:44 - get I was using query in my example but
64:50 - maybe we can okay so okay okay so what I
65:04 - need to look at is the chrome tabs
65:08 - package I don't know if package is the
65:10 - right thing to say the API and that's
65:12 - here so extension slash tabs this is a
65:15 - set of functions that I can employ to
65:18 - sort of figure out about the tabs so one
65:21 - thing I can do is just probably get
65:22 - current is all I need that I actually in
65:24 - some of my examples I noticed I'm using
65:26 - this query to like query about all the
65:28 - tabs but I think all I need to do is say
65:30 - get current so get current just gets the
65:33 - current tab which is what I want so I am
65:36 - going to say first right to do is say
65:41 - chrome tabs get current and a got tab so
65:48 - I need another call back and not getting
65:50 - into this sort of like crazy nested call
65:52 - back stuff which I really want to try to
65:56 - avoid and some of the new arrow syntax
65:59 - and other promises stuff I'll get into
66:02 - that at some point kind of but I think
66:04 - this is fine so right the user presses a
66:06 - key new text and someone suggested that
66:09 - I call this change text which I think is
66:11 - better then as soon as that happens I
66:15 - want to say which is the tab which the
66:17 - current tab so I need to get the current
66:20 - tab once I've got the current tab it
66:22 - should be the actual current tab is
66:24 - passed into my callback as an argument
66:27 - so once I do that I could just send the
66:29 - message to that particular tab I'm going
66:31 - to send the message
66:32 - oh right I'm not actually doing anything
66:34 - of value yet and to send that message
66:36 - hello and let's see what happens so now
66:38 - let's go and oh and let me in the
66:41 - content scripts console time console
66:44 - logging the message so I'm actually just
66:46 - gonna console.log the whole message so
66:49 - we should see that in the content script
66:50 - so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
66:52 - reload my extension I'm gonna go over
66:56 - here to this page I'm going to open up
66:58 - the JavaScript console and when I do
67:02 - this I don't see anything yet but as
67:04 - soon as I start typing in that paragraph
67:06 - I should see here the message coming
67:08 - through
67:17 - that didn't work so let's look at
67:20 - inspector inspect this element let's
67:23 - look at the console Oh tabs dot get
67:26 - current cannot read property idea of
67:28 - undefined so you might need permissions
67:35 - ah so thank you breaking news from the
67:38 - chat firs I'll Simon Thank You Simon
67:40 - suggested that I call it change text and
67:43 - I probably need to add anytime you start
67:47 - to use something from the chrome API I
67:50 - need to explicitly say in my manifest
67:52 - out JSON that I intend to use this so I
67:55 - don't know if this is if that's the
67:58 - problem but we're gonna have to figure
67:59 - this out
68:00 - so one thing that it could be is that I
68:03 - need to go to my manifest.json and add
68:05 - something like permissions is
68:08 - permissions already in here no
68:10 - permissions and this should be maybe an
68:16 - array
68:17 - what's an array I think and it has tabs
68:23 - as one of my permissions so this could
68:26 - be the thing that fixes it let's try it
68:28 - I kind of think that I might have done
68:30 - something else wrong but let's try some
68:31 - and reload this I am going to reload
68:34 - this open up here
68:42 - yes work either
68:44 - I really just wait to in love with my
68:46 - sound in fact somebody should probably I
68:48 - probably need an intervention about that
68:50 - alright so that was not the air here I'm
68:53 - gonna think about this a little bit
69:03 - let's look at the documentation do you
69:28 - know what's good to do read the
69:30 - documentation gets the tab that this
69:34 - script call is being made from maybe
69:36 - undefined if called from a non tab
69:39 - context for example a background page or
69:45 - other words just just or pop up view so
69:50 - that's definitely the problem and that's
69:52 - probably why what I actually did in one
69:55 - of my examples is used query so let's
69:59 - let's use query so let's try using query
70:03 - so I'm gonna change this to saying I'm
70:07 - gonna go back to my content scrub where
70:09 - am I in the where am I looking in the
70:12 - pop up yeah in the pop up I'm gonna
70:14 - change this to chrome tabs query and
70:17 - what I need to do if I'm gonna run query
70:19 - is I need to give it some parameters for
70:21 - the query like I need to I want it says
70:25 - optional but I want like all of the
70:27 - active tabs and I want I think it's only
70:34 - active or current window and current
70:37 - window I might not need these but I
70:39 - recall doing this in a previous example
70:41 - so but you it's up to you to read this
70:44 - documentation to see what tabs you want
70:46 - returned so I need that so now I can
70:50 - query for all of those tabs this is now
70:53 - I want to say
70:54 - tabs because what I'm gonna do is get an
70:56 - array of tabs I know that the query
70:58 - function probably if I look at the
70:59 - documentation
71:00 - it explains gets all the tabs that have
71:03 - the specified properties there might be
71:06 - a way for me to just get only the
71:07 - current tab but I'm pretty sure that
71:10 - tabs index zero is the tab that I want
71:14 - so let's try this now I think we're in
71:17 - good shape here I'm gonna go over here
71:20 - and I'm going to say reload the
71:22 - extension I'm gonna come over here press
71:29 - the pop-up Oh seriously how could that
71:35 - not have worked let's look here inspect
71:40 - console huh no error message so let's
71:47 - let's take a look at this so let's let's
71:51 - debug this text changed
71:56 - let's console.log that video is way more
72:01 - debugging than usual
72:03 - and let's console.log let's look at the
72:06 - tabs I'm gonna say got tabs and let's
72:12 - console.log it and now let's try this
72:17 - again
72:20 - to reload the extension I'm gonna not
72:22 - use my ridiculous sound effects anymore
72:24 - because I'm overdoing it I'm gonna
72:26 - reload the extension I'm gonna press
72:27 - this oh of course now it works I
72:31 - probably just like missed clicking save
72:33 - or reload or something anyway so I think
72:36 - it actually did work but that's how I
72:38 - would have debug it if it hadn't worked
72:40 - weirdly enough I like behind by one
72:43 - reload right because now I'm not seeing
72:46 - my messages save am I not like saving in
72:52 - the right it's like behind by one reload
72:54 - let's reload let's refresh oh oh no no
73:02 - no no no I need the classic error I'm
73:05 - looking for all of my messages here
73:07 - only the content script messages will be
73:09 - there if I want to see the pop-up
73:12 - messages they are here so that is
73:14 - working it's an array it's this is the
73:18 - information I got lots of information is
73:19 - an incognito tab what URL is it on
73:22 - what's the width you can see there's
73:23 - lots of information that you can get all
73:25 - right we're in good shape let's move a
73:26 - little bit more quickly here just to
73:28 - finish this off so what I actually want
73:30 - to do is I want to send what I want to
73:33 - send is what was it called I called it
73:37 - user input user input value and what I
73:42 - want to do in the content script is
73:45 - rather than change the background color
73:48 - I'm going to change the inner HTML I
73:54 - think that's what I write to message dot
73:59 - text and I don't I'm not going to bother
74:01 - to check if it's a certain map there's
74:03 - only one kind of message I can get so as
74:05 - long as I've gotten a message change
74:07 - whatever the paragraph text to that
74:09 - message okay here we go
74:10 - I'm feeling good about this I think this
74:13 - is going to work and I'm going to reload
74:17 - the extension I'm going to refresh this
74:20 - page it's got some paragraphs on it I'm
74:23 - gonna feel confident enough to actually
74:26 - close the JavaScript console I'm going
74:30 - to open this up and now here we go
74:36 - oh it's the wars I really shouldn't have
74:38 - done that all right I shouldn't have
74:39 - closed anything let's try this again
74:43 - let's look it
74:46 - let's look here console Oh
74:50 - syntax error in my code ah the worst I'm
74:54 - the worst sketch - line 21
74:57 - Oh would I put this stomach on there
74:59 - probably all of you noticed this and
75:00 - you've bound to watch like an extra two
75:01 - minutes of this video it could edit out
75:04 - this mistake but probably gonna leave it
75:06 - in let's try this one more time
75:12 - reload extension and open oh no and now
75:19 - press this and now I'm going to type
75:22 - into the paragraph release inspect
75:30 - console ah okay so it's that's working
75:37 - all right let's see what's going on here
75:39 - in the content script console dot log
75:44 - message didn't get the message
75:47 - sketch Jas might see I think we're gonna
75:52 - have to do some editing on this one is
75:53 - too many
75:54 - I should be one line below yeah the
75:57 - semicolon should go here but
76:02 - [Music]
76:09 - Oh is there something weird with the
76:11 - sound effects those messages maybe
76:14 - they're not P elements no all right hold
76:16 - on
76:17 - Oh dot style this dot style is not
76:27 - relevant I had that south and I was
76:29 - changing the background color innerhtml
76:32 - is not a part of the style it's just
76:33 - part of the element itself so I think
76:39 - it's gonna work this time
76:40 - I've corrected this everything's good
76:43 - here in terms of my syntax let's try
76:46 - this one more time okay here we go I am
76:50 - now going to reload the extension
76:58 - refresh the page press this button and
77:01 - start typing yeah look whatever I type
77:05 - into here now goes into every single
77:07 - paragraph elements on the page this
77:10 - worked
77:11 - exclamation point thank you thank you
77:16 - very much so this has been the end of
77:18 - this sending a message from a pop-up to
77:22 - the page and I'm gonna do a coding
77:24 - challenge which you'll find at some
77:25 - point when I publish it where I'm going
77:27 - to actually take content from the page
77:28 - and display information while querying
77:31 - an API information about it there so I'm
77:34 - gonna do that in a coding challenge soon
77:36 - thanks for watching oh my god I it's
77:44 - already 5:20
77:53 - now here's the thing this is actually
77:55 - really driving me crazy this delay I
77:57 - just want to see if I unplug and plug
78:01 - back in if it fixes it
78:04 - so I'm unplugging no so that delay is
78:14 - happening somewhere else I probably have
78:15 - to restart the computer which I'm not
78:17 - going to do because it'll cause the
78:19 - stream to end so hopefully everything is
78:20 - just fine
78:23 - whoo yes that's right since I did
78:25 - innerhtml instead a text content I can
78:27 - actually type stuff in there all right
78:30 - boy I'm exhausted just a long week
78:34 - all right so let me think I like the
78:44 - idea of doing this coding challenge so
78:47 - let me look at my list here so I did the
78:51 - least I did these two things I could do
78:53 - quickly the tab override it's like the
78:55 - simplest thing in the world I might as
78:56 - well make a video for that I don't
78:58 - actually even yeah inner HTML is but
79:01 - yeah security nightmare but you know
79:03 - whatever
79:05 - maybe I should a little addendum there I
79:07 - don't know if I should need to do an
79:08 - addendum but tab override let me look at
79:16 - that
79:16 - I feel like that's the easiest thing in
79:18 - the world to do Chrome extension
79:30 - override yeah this is like the easiest
79:36 - thing in the world to do you just change
79:40 - you just use the chrome URL override
79:42 - what's let's do that cuz that's gonna be
79:44 - like a short simple quick video and that
79:47 - might need a short break and then I'm
79:50 - gonna do a couple coding challenges and
79:52 - just see what I'll see what else I can
79:53 - manage today all right can I remember
79:58 - this chrome underscore URL overrides you
80:02 - tab I really need this break it's gonna
80:03 - make me
80:04 - P so we gonna make this one this
80:07 - tutorial go quickly I think I also might
80:10 - have had too much caffeine which was
80:11 - really a problem for me alright so let
80:24 - me get I'm gonna get that
80:35 - in a way what I kind of want to do is
80:36 - actually use the word Nick API and just
80:39 - get like the word of the day or
80:40 - something but let me just you know what
80:42 - I'm just going to show how to do this I
80:47 - can use the let me do this simple
80:56 - content script one post six tab override
81:04 - I'm just trying to think like what could
81:06 - I put as the content yeah thank you
81:15 - developer.chrome.com/apps ketch and
81:34 - it'll just do something silly like count
81:39 - oh you can replace any of these other
81:45 - things - new tab bookmarks history
81:49 - fascinating fascinating yeah so here it
81:52 - is alright history new tab
81:58 - great-great-great-great-great quick
82:00 - quick review all right wonderful
82:08 - and let's get rid of this one and let's
82:12 - go to tab override and
82:29 - and we'll leave all this here okay
82:37 - this Blake oh yes great idea
82:41 - kitten override that's a great idea
82:45 - I love that idea so let me get a let me
82:57 - just get like the sketch here so it's
83:00 - there and I never fixed that people are
83:17 - gonna go crazy kittens then let me get
83:24 - the kitten images
83:33 - [Music]
83:37 - and I'm just going to call this like one
83:48 - two three four five okay so I'm setting
84:01 - this up and here we go
84:12 - all right
84:19 - this this is really things my green
84:24 - thing here I guess I have to lower this
84:26 - a little bit like the keying is a little
84:30 - bit problematic today but hopefully it's
84:32 - fine you know what this needs to be
84:34 - maybe if this turns over a little bit
84:36 - points a little bit down it's not better
84:42 - okay I've got one more probably more
84:44 - than that but at least one more thing to
84:46 - show you about Chrome extensions I'm
84:47 - gonna show you about overrides what is
84:49 - an override so first of all if you use
84:51 - the Chrome browser and you ever hit
84:53 - command T or new tab you get this
84:55 - default page which has a Google search
84:57 - and like shows you some recent web pages
84:59 - that you've been to this is something
85:01 - you can override you can create your own
85:03 - web page that appears for a new tab and
85:07 - there are lots of examples of Chrome
85:09 - extensions that you can get that show
85:10 - you pretty nice things and daily
85:12 - affirmations and stuff like that you can
85:15 - also override the history page and well
85:18 - something else where do you find out
85:19 - information about this it's I'll include
85:21 - a link to this in this video's
85:22 - description this is the documentation
85:24 - for override pages so you can override
85:26 - the bookmark page the history page in
85:28 - the new tab page I'm going to override
85:30 - just the new tab page and the way that
85:33 - we do this is by adding this code here
85:36 - to the manifest JSON so I'm gonna copy
85:41 - this and I'm gonna go to the manifest
85:44 - JSON for a new Chrome extension I'm
85:46 - gonna get rid of the content script I
85:48 - just copied one of my previous ones I
85:49 - could get I don't need a content script
85:51 - as part of this and actually it wouldn't
85:53 - make sense to have a new tab override
85:55 - that also had a Content script I don't
85:57 - think so and I want to override new tab
86:00 - and what I want to do is point to my
86:06 - HTML page and I happen to have
86:11 - associated with this project this is my
86:15 - example number 6 a folder called sketch
86:18 - and it this is a p5 sketch and as an
86:21 - index on HTML page so what I want to say
86:23 - is sketch slash index at HTML I am going
86:30 - to
86:30 - just say function setup create canvas
86:35 - 200 200 you know background zero and I'm
86:39 - gonna say I'm gonna add something here
86:42 - like h1 hears a kitten cuz people make a
86:45 - new so I'm gonna add some stuff to the
86:49 - HTML and to the JavaScript just to see
86:51 - that this works now what I'm gonna do is
86:53 - go to my extensions page I am going to
86:56 - load the extension I want to load my
86:59 - example number 6 ah right I got an error
87:03 - what is my error looks like I have an
87:06 - extra comma here and it's telling me
87:08 - that I don't have valid JSON so I should
87:10 - be able to go back to my manifest.json
87:12 - get rid of that comma hit save try to
87:16 - then say a retry that worked and now I
87:20 - should open a new page yep so every time
87:22 - I open a new tab I get that webpage so
87:26 - let's make it do something a little more
87:27 - interesting let's say let's let's
87:32 - actually not have a canvas you obviously
87:34 - have an animation we say no canvas I'm
87:36 - gonna say R equals a random number
87:42 - between 1 and 6 because I actually want
87:46 - you know I'm gonna say between 0 and 1 2
87:50 - 3 4 5 0 and 5 I have what I have is and
87:55 - then I'm gonna say a create image
87:58 - kittens slash R plus dot jpg so what you
88:08 - might notice is that I have a folder
88:10 - called kittens with five images of
88:13 - kittens all named one through five so I
88:16 - probably should have started naming him
88:18 - with zero but I could just add one to it
88:19 - so I want to create a Dom element which
88:22 - is a kitten image and show it on the
88:23 - page so I'm gonna do that and I'm going
88:26 - to and we might have an issue I mean I'm
88:28 - just waiting to see what happens I'm
88:31 - going to reload the extension I'm gonna
88:33 - make a new tab up whoa that is and it
88:36 - worked well now here's the thing
88:39 - I should probably size it
88:45 - and I'm just gonna say image size window
88:48 - with window height image dot position
88:53 - zero zero so I mean this is some silly I
88:56 - should probably be more thoughtful about
88:58 - CSS and all that but I'm just going to
88:59 - use some p5 code to size the image to
89:02 - the page and maybe I'll get rid of the
89:05 - here's a kitten's message now I'm going
89:07 - to reload again and now make a new tab
89:12 - every time I make a new tab I get a
89:16 - different kitten yay so this is how you
89:19 - do a override so now the world is your
89:23 - kitten oyster think of what you might
89:27 - make something that checks for today's
89:29 - weather if you want to make something
89:30 - practical something that shows something
89:32 - beautiful something that reminds you of
89:34 - an important message anything that you
89:36 - could think of you can make anything you
89:38 - can make a webpage you can make as the
89:39 - new tab override thanks for watching
89:41 - subscribe like I'm supposed to say at
89:43 - the end the video this was a short one
89:45 - so maybe might actually hear it
89:55 - well everyone's telling me about how
89:57 - horrible my CSS skills are which is
89:59 - absolutely true I'm really losing steam
90:03 - here 5:30 yeah document.body dot style
90:10 - dot background equals URL kitten dot jpg
90:12 - yes but the point of what I'm showing is
90:15 - not the efficient way to make the kitten
90:18 - in the background I'm just showing you
90:20 - gonna have a p5 sketch so or any webpage
90:22 - and you drink some water I'm gonna take
90:26 - a short break I'm gonna play the dis
90:36 - song I'm gonna play the Vista song I'm
90:45 - going to mute my microphone and I'm
90:52 - gonna leave you with kittens this kitten
90:54 - I guess I'm going to take a short break
91:00 - and I'm going to come back let's look at
91:01 - our let me let me sort of figure out
91:02 - what I want to do for
91:11 - in the next half an hour that I have so
91:15 - I got through these three things so
91:17 - things that I could do are the coding
91:21 - challenge that looks up something onward
91:23 - Nick which I think would be interesting
91:26 - [Music]
91:27 - I'm gonna skip the omnibox thing
91:29 - definitely least today I should look
91:32 - investigate like how to make a Firefox
91:34 - extension I'm really not prepared to do
91:35 - that but I can at least maybe look at
91:40 - that a little bit
91:40 - WebGL let's see alright so let me take a
91:44 - break here actually let's do let me let
91:48 - me at least put up a little strawpoll
91:50 - thing see what people are interested in
91:58 - so options word by the way the word
92:05 - lookup Chrome extension involves a back
92:07 - we'll need a background script and a
92:09 - content script and a pop-up which I
92:12 - haven't done at all so that's kind of
92:13 - interesting word Nick like lookup
92:17 - extension WebGL revisited what else do I
92:27 - have on this list that I could do that's
92:30 - kind of those are my two things I would
92:33 - like to do and maybe I just yeah and
92:41 - then I'm just gonna whatever I'm just
92:44 - curious
92:44 - this is now absolutely that I'm doing
92:46 - this straw polls I think I'm just gonna
92:48 - try to do both of these but if I only
92:50 - had time for one which would you prefer
92:54 - I kind of want to be done with the
92:56 - Chrome extensions no strawpoll everybody
92:58 - I feel like if I do that last Chrome
93:00 - extension coding challenge I can be done
93:02 - with Chrome extensions I can talk about
93:04 - generic browser extensions for Firefox
93:08 - and even try to make one and then that
93:10 - might actually be it for today
93:13 - yeah connection to any API and a Papa
93:15 - but that's super interesting it's gonna
93:17 - open up a lot of ideas so I'm gonna mute
93:20 - my microphone
93:21 - you won't hear from me I'm gonna put on
93:22 - some music see if I can pee
93:25 - I always forget
93:28 - [Music]
93:41 - [Music]
94:23 - forget this I'm gonna do this this dot
94:27 - this dot this star this start song never
94:29 - forget the Vista but somebody composed
94:32 - that song for me
95:06 - alright I'm back I realized what I
95:09 - should do is play I forgot that I can
95:11 - play my crazy trailer thing which is
95:14 - this thing which guys can hear you
95:16 - talking over a while while you take a
95:18 - break but I'm not gonna play this right
95:20 - now you can go and find that video on
95:22 - the home page of my channel o persistent
95:26 - data with local storage such a good idea
95:29 - I'm sorry everybody I'm not gonna get
95:32 - much let me add that can I I'm logged in
95:36 - as myself that's good so I'm obviously
95:39 - not I don't think I'm gonna get that
95:40 - today but I do think that would be worth
95:45 - so I'm going to do API lookup and
95:50 - persistent data with local storage
95:54 - I actually so I would like to do that I
95:57 - wanted to be done with Chrome extensions
95:59 - but that would be worth looking at some
96:01 - time so let's commit these changes
96:03 - alright everybody so what I need to do
96:06 - now is I need to give myself kind of
96:11 - like a basic template I'm gonna use the
96:13 - pop-up Swan oops
96:22 - copy can I just do like this or
96:25 - something yeah there we go
96:26 - oh seven I need something to perk me up
96:32 - here I know what it okay oh no not this
96:36 - one
96:38 - okay we are now doing word Nick so I
96:49 - need to be prepared
97:01 - so coding train so I can leave all this
97:05 - actually because I'm going to revise it
97:09 - in the tutorial there's this there's
97:12 - that but what and then there's sketch so
97:21 - boy I'm gonna have to look up how to
97:23 - receive the message it's fine I'm gonna
97:30 - but I do need my API key so where can I
97:41 - get that if I go to API is data word
97:52 - Nick word info hopefully my API key is
98:00 - still valid all right
98:15 - okay Oh weird nick has a public key
98:21 - that's good to know I don't mind using
98:22 - mine now I can always change it or
98:24 - regenerate it or something drink a
98:27 - little while I'm sorry but usually I
98:29 - simply won't have energy good thing I
98:32 - have to leave around 6 because I'm
98:33 - really running out of energy but let's
98:36 - let's definitely at least make this this
98:40 - is gonna take longer than 20 minutes but
98:44 - because I have there's a lot of stuff
98:46 - I'm gonna have to look up as I don't
98:48 - know any of this off the top of my head
98:50 - but let's go close all this and this all
99:07 - right here we go
99:20 - welcome to a coding challenge in this
99:23 - coding challenge I am going to attempt
99:25 - to make a Chrome extension where you can
99:30 - let me start over again it's a good web
99:33 - page to be on for this let's just go to
99:36 - Wikipedia
99:46 - how about a steam train steam locomotive
99:54 - okay all right
100:06 - hello welcome to a coding challenge in
100:09 - this coding challenge I am going to
100:10 - attempt to make a Chrome extension that
100:12 - allows you to highlight any word and
100:14 - then press a button up in the corner of
100:17 - the browser and it will open up a pop-up
100:20 - and show you the definition of that word
100:21 - so I need a lot of pieces to this here
100:24 - if I come back to my if I come back to
100:30 - my diagram here of all the pieces of the
100:31 - Chrome extension and I can't look at a
100:33 - diagram without marker what I need I
100:36 - certainly do I even need a Content
100:39 - script I just realized that I don't
100:41 - think I need a content script for this
100:44 - amazingly high the idea I wanted to have
100:46 - come up with an idea where I needed all
100:48 - three of these but I'm realizing that I
100:50 - think that background scripts can
100:52 - determine what it is you've highlighted
100:55 - on the page because that's kind of a
100:57 - browser action it's not really a part of
101:00 - the page that's kind of something you're
101:01 - doing with the browser itself you're
101:03 - highlighting some word and then I need
101:06 - the background script to send a message
101:08 - to the pop-up you know I guess I could
101:10 - affect the content script so this will
101:12 - be an exercise for you I'm gonna put the
101:13 - results in the pop-up but you could do
101:16 - something when you highlight a page you
101:17 - actually just create a little like div
101:20 - overlay wherever that word is or
101:22 - something that shows the definition but
101:24 - I'm gonna put that information in a
101:26 - pop-up and the pop-up is going to go in
101:29 - query an API like word Nick and look for
101:33 - the definition of that word okay did you
101:43 - guys hear that because I just sometimes
101:53 - some days some days Google dictionary
101:58 - and that's the one I use okay all right
102:04 - so I'm not gonna code from nothing here
102:07 - because I'm really tired a lot of time
102:10 - so I'm gonna use the code that I had at
102:13 - the
102:13 - end of my popups tutorial which is a
102:17 - witch which I'll link to in this video's
102:19 - description
102:20 - so actually what I would I I don't need
102:22 - it I'm gonna remove the content script I
102:24 - do need to add a background script I
102:29 - think I do this how do I do that I think
102:37 - is it just the name of the background
102:39 - script I'll have to look that up and I
102:43 - want to call this I want to call this
102:48 - word Nik look up okay let me double
102:55 - check one of my old examples look that's
102:59 - not that one hold on give me a second
103:01 - here okay I can do this everybody yes I
103:07 - can I'm gonna go back and look at one of
103:11 - my background script examples and oh
103:15 - this is what it looks like I just
103:16 - blanked I don't have this stuff
103:19 - memorized so to add a background script
103:21 - it needs to look like this so I now have
103:24 - a background yes and I have a browser
103:28 - action that look up a word and it's
103:34 - going to go to this particular sketch so
103:36 - first let me actually just see if what I
103:38 - can make happen is I can just if I
103:43 - select a word and I press the pop-up I
103:46 - see that word in the pop-up I just want
103:48 - to make sure that that happens so let me
103:50 - try that
103:50 - alright so what I'm going to do is okay
103:57 - in the background script I think what I
104:00 - need is an event for when I highlight a
104:03 - word and actually I pretty sure this
104:06 - event is like I can actually just use
104:07 - use the mouse up event so what I need to
104:10 - look for is Chrome extension mouse up
104:16 - event so it's really window dot mouse up
104:21 - what I think this is going to work for
104:25 - me
104:29 - is it just a regular event listener hold
104:32 - on time out I don't like that I'm doing
104:36 - this coding job before get event
104:46 - listeners oh it's not the right place
104:53 - look at this actually look at this
104:57 - here's a Google Group with actually
105:00 - asking this question probably capture
105:02 - selected text when the extension button
105:04 - is clicked it was exactly what I'm
105:06 - trying to do this is way too much
105:13 - how interesting
105:15 - I guess I could do this in the content
105:19 - script oh oh maybe I need to do this in
105:25 - the content timeout everybody I'm sorry
105:28 - I'm gonna look at my example this is the
105:30 - Don the worst I really don't know this
105:35 - stuff they should prepare for this I
105:36 - made this example like two years ago I'm
105:38 - just gonna look at it so this is the one
105:43 - that I think I do the word Nick thing
105:45 - and I do have a background script and a
105:48 - Content script because actually I should
105:51 - just start over
105:51 - ah of course I need to mouse up on the
105:55 - content page then I send that to the
105:57 - background script because I cannot send
105:59 - a message from the from the content
106:04 - script to the pop-up I can't send the
106:08 - message to the pop-up because the pop-up
106:09 - might not be open so I send it to the
106:13 - background script and then the
106:16 - background script receives that message
106:23 - and puts in a global variable this was
106:27 - the trick that I was going to show and
106:31 - receives it and then and I think I
106:36 - should just
106:37 - start over I'm just start this tutorial
106:40 - and then in the the pop-up whoops it
106:52 - actually there's a way to get yeah
106:54 - chromed-out extension not get background
106:56 - page dot word okay alright everybody
106:59 - mm-hmm we're gonna start over we're just
107:03 - gonna do this again it's gonna be
107:04 - awesome so I do need a background script
107:08 - do you need a content script and okay
107:23 - right everybody document I get selection
107:34 - in windowed I get selection both exist
107:36 - alright anybody who's in the slack
107:39 - channel who wants to feed me lines of
107:41 - code to enter I usually I'm like I'm
107:44 - like now I just give it up it's like
107:45 - it's like anybody can help me out here
107:48 - gonna make this happen okay
107:49 - what I prefer about Firefox over chrome
107:52 - is history management features in um
107:53 - interesting discussions going on here
107:54 - alright do we go welcome its promote a
108:04 - challenge where I really need just I
108:07 - don't know when you're watching this in
108:09 - the future in the past on a spaceship on
108:13 - your phone but I need I need I need some
108:16 - good vibes right now I'm gonna try to
108:18 - make this is gonna be a hard one for me
108:19 - I'm gonna make a Chrome extension that
108:21 - allows you to on any webpage like this
108:24 - steam locomotive Wikipedia page select
108:27 - some text and look up the look up the
108:31 - definition of a word that you've
108:33 - selected I'm gonna use the word Nick API
108:34 - and I'm gonna have the definition appear
108:36 - in a pop-up now we could make some case
108:39 - that this is not like the most
108:40 - thoughtful and elegant user interaction
108:43 - and so my challenge for you after I do
108:46 - this is there's probably a nicer way to
108:47 - do this like it's select should you
108:49 - actually just have the definition pop-up
108:51 - right there what's what's it what's
108:53 - a more elegant user interaction I can't
108:54 - even think of it but I'm actually the
108:56 - reason why I want to do this is because
108:58 - this particular idea requires all the
109:02 - pieces that I've shown you in my
109:03 - tutorials and requires a Content script
109:05 - a Content script it knows about the page
109:08 - is going to be a listen for the event of
109:10 - me selecting some text it requires a
109:13 - pop-up because I say so because I want
109:16 - to show the definition in the pop-up so
109:18 - in theory all that it requires is the
109:21 - content script and the pop-up because
109:23 - why not just send a message from the
109:25 - content script of the pop-up the problem
109:27 - is I can't guarantee that the pop-up is
109:29 - open if I probably couldn't open the
109:32 - pop-up automatically so I'm not going to
109:34 - open the pop-up automatically that's a
109:36 - code child
109:37 - see you if that's even possible I'm
109:38 - gonna select the text I'm gonna send the
109:41 - selected text to the background script
109:44 - by the way I was talking about this
109:45 - earlier that's why this whiteboard
109:47 - already has some notes about this then
109:49 - the background script is going to hold
109:51 - on to that selected text the pop-up is
109:53 - gonna get it from the background script
109:55 - it's going to go out to word Nick and
109:56 - it's going to show the results all right
109:58 - I can do it I could do it I'm gonna do
110:01 - it all right so let's let's work on this
110:03 - I'm gonna open up my chat that's going
110:05 - here just in case anybody can help me
110:07 - out the first thing I might need from
110:09 - the chat is how I get the selected text
110:12 - in the content script but actually
110:14 - before I even get to that let me look at
110:16 - what's going on here so I need a Content
110:18 - script I've got that permissions tabs
110:21 - and that actually might be unnecessary
110:23 - so let's just take that out right now I
110:25 - don't think I'm using that I need a
110:28 - browser action which is going to look up
110:31 - a definition so I'm gonna put that as
110:34 - the little message definition definition
110:38 - and then I need a background script this
110:47 - right background is is it script is it
110:50 - scripts something is definitely wrong
110:53 - here
110:54 - ooh boy no no not an array an object
110:58 - right oh let's just look at one of my
111:01 - previous ones background scripts oh boy
111:05 - I had a way wrong I was way wrong
111:08 - okay so adding a background script I
111:10 - need background which has scripts and
111:13 - then an array of JavaScript files that
111:15 - are part of the background script okay
111:17 - so now I have a background script a
111:20 - and by the way the code base that I'm
111:21 - starting with is from the end of my
111:23 - popups tutorial so I'll link to that
111:25 - video in this description so if you
111:26 - actually want to like what's up what's
111:27 - the code that I started with you can
111:29 - watch that video and wherever I ended
111:31 - that's this code okay but there's very
111:33 - little in it I I'm the the web page the
111:37 - pop-up has nothing in it just it I'm
111:39 - using the p5 library so just set up in
111:41 - know canvas and
111:44 - the background script it actually has
111:46 - some code in it from a while ago which i
111:49 - think is I'm gonna get rid of cuz that's
111:52 - no longer relevant I'm going to leave
111:56 - the but yeah okay so here we go and the
112:03 - content script has some other code as
112:05 - actually that I as well so I'm gonna
112:07 - actually get rid of all this
112:08 - it's very terrible idea so first let me
112:11 - at least get the selected text in the
112:13 - content script okay so I think I want to
112:15 - say like document dot event what is it
112:20 - what is it somebody told me document get
112:22 - selection a mouse up I wanna i want the
112:25 - mouse up event in the content script
112:30 - this would be an edit point no you guys
112:41 - didn't listen to my instructions and
112:43 - feed me the code that i eat at the time
112:46 - that i need it good thing the camera
112:50 - went off now anyway what's the event the
112:52 - mouse up event they can't remember this
112:54 - stuff especially not today is my brain
112:56 - is melted yeah alessandro is saying in
113:02 - the chat i believe i believe a better
113:05 - way of doing this would be when you open
113:07 - the pop-up send a message to the content
113:09 - script asking for the selected word
113:10 - which will answer back to the pop-up in
113:12 - the select word yeah that's actually so
113:13 - i'm gonna mention that ok window on
113:15 - mouse up okay all right so okay alright
113:25 - so by the way in the chat i'm being told
113:28 - a better way of doing this would be when
113:30 - you open the pop-up send a message to
113:32 - the content script asking for the
113:34 - selected word and then send that back so
113:36 - that's actually true I'm gonna still do
113:38 - this in a ridiculous way because I want
113:39 - to show you some other pieces of how you
113:41 - can have the background on the pop-up
113:42 - talk to each other but that is a better
113:44 - way to do it you should fix my code
113:46 - after I'm done so the first thing that I
113:48 - need is window dot add event listener
113:52 - this is a way for me to listen for the
113:55 - by the way I'm looking at the chat here
113:57 - as people are giving me some of this
113:59 - code of your mouse up and then I need a
114:02 - callback which I could write in a fancy
114:04 - way but I'm just going to say I'm gonna
114:09 - say moused UPS function worst name ever
114:20 - function so now if that event happens
114:26 - what I want to do is get the selection
114:29 - so I want to say the selected text is
114:34 - window dot I think it's just got to get
114:37 - selection
114:41 - let me just console.log that so what
114:46 - this should do is get this little all I
114:48 - should see is a console log of what's
114:51 - been selected yeah and I like this we're
114:55 - word selected it's gonna be a problem if
114:59 - you select more than a word but less
115:00 - that was a that was a good name Thank
115:02 - You Simon
115:03 - all right window decade selection okay
115:06 - so now oh I've got to load my extension
115:09 - look at my extension we're Nick it's
115:14 - called Wernick it's working I mean it's
115:16 - there I'm gonna go to this page I'm
115:18 - gonna open up the console and I'm gonna
115:21 - listen for this that event is not
115:27 - happening let's see here refresh the
115:32 - page chrome extension go so that is
115:36 - happening so what did I miss here
115:42 - window add eventlistener mouse up well
115:46 - let's just see if this has even happen
115:47 - oh wait okay hold on the Queen note get
115:50 - selection must be wrong let's see if at
115:52 - least if like were let me just
115:54 - console.log word select I'm sure window
115:56 - that get selection is totally wrong so
115:59 - let me reload the extension yeah oh
116:04 - and I'm having a weird thing where I'm
116:06 - either not reloading or refreshing
116:08 - properly because I'm getting more stuff
116:11 - happens so words selected and then it's
116:14 - actually selected text so selected text
116:18 - is an object selection and what I want
116:21 - is the actual anchor node there's got to
116:27 - be a way node value through a there's
116:31 - got to be a way for me to just get it
116:33 - without having this giant object but
116:37 - whole text text content is probably what
116:40 - I want
116:40 - so select should select a text anchor
116:45 - text whole content let's try that or
116:54 - maybe I want just text content all right
116:58 - let's see that was that something text
117:01 - content yeah so let's see if I let's see
117:03 - if this is right now let me just be
117:05 - really careful you're safe safe safe
117:09 - then I'm gonna go here and do a refresh
117:13 - and by the way let me rename the
117:15 - extension so I know what's going on it's
117:18 - the extension to be called word lookup
117:22 - okay I haven't looked at you in a while
117:24 - but really focused on my screen
117:26 - apologies hi thank you for watching this
117:28 - so let me reload the extension change
117:32 - the name okay now I'm gonna come back to
117:35 - here
117:35 - clear this refresh this page I'm going
117:39 - to find a word to select okay undefined
117:45 - it word selected so I clearly didn't
117:47 - look through that object carefully
117:48 - enough I'm gonna pause here for a second
117:53 - nobody's where's all the people
117:54 - correcting me words selected alright so
118:03 - I have to go back it's so sad
118:07 - hold on what I can do is
118:25 - know why all of a sudden today like the
118:28 - screen dimensions seemed totally wrong
118:30 - for me this we're gonna have to do some
118:33 - heavy editing on this let me go back I
118:40 - think just having one error and then
118:42 - fixing it I obviously typed in the wrong
118:43 - thing here so I'll debug this but we're
118:45 - good I'm gonna get the correct
119:04 - all right let me look at this again
119:07 - selection dot anchor node is there
119:14 - another place anchor node dot whoa
119:20 - that's whole text I don't want that I'm
119:27 - sure there's an easier way to do this
119:36 - just due to string no interesting does
119:42 - it actually work is that what I did to
119:48 - three yes that's what I did so you can
120:01 - see here that the selection is this
120:03 - whole elaborate object thing and I I
120:05 - just spend some time which you might
120:07 - have watched or I'm I'm not sure um be
120:10 - trying to like find the text in there
120:11 - but I thank you
120:13 - I just realized thank you to Alka in the
120:15 - chat that I can actually just say to
120:17 - string and what that's gonna do it's
120:19 - gonna take the selected text instead of
120:21 - giving me the full object about the
120:23 - selection it's just going to give me the
120:24 - actual text and put it right there and
120:27 - so so let's now let's go back reload
120:31 - this extension refresh the page select
120:36 - and there we go and were middle right
120:41 - you could see that I'm getting stuff
120:42 - selected wonderful okay now what I need
120:45 - to do is once I've selected something I
120:48 - want to send this information to the
120:49 - background page okay so first thing
120:57 - first okay so first thing let's get rid
121:00 - of this console log and let me first
121:03 - check if selected text dot length is
121:08 - greater than zero so if you know I could
121:11 - have a mouse up where there's no actual
121:12 - selected text so I want to make sure
121:14 - there's at least something there
121:15 - and then I need to send a message I'm
121:18 - looking for my notes about all the
121:19 - different ways to do things in a Content
121:23 - script if I want to send a message all I
121:26 - need to do I think I could just do
121:29 - because I don't need to send to a tab I
121:31 - want to send to the background script
121:32 - again probably use chrome runtime at it
121:37 - point as I look this up should really
121:40 - just have this I know what why am I
121:42 - doing this I should just put this on the
121:43 - computer over here I'm being silly I'm
121:48 - looking at the chat and all I need to do
121:51 - is do what everybody always says that I
121:54 - do that I don't do but I'm actually
121:56 - gonna do it now which is just put the
121:58 - code that I need over here because this
122:03 - is not working with me there's just I my
122:05 - brain is not coming up with this stuff
122:08 - off the phone the fly yeah it's so much
122:12 - simpler than I think it's just the
122:13 - runtime send message okay okay so all I
122:19 - need I was right I'm right I think I
122:22 - just need to say chrome runtime send
122:25 - message this is a generic way and this
122:28 - runtime lower case let me look guys note
122:31 - somewhere in lower case yeah so this is
122:33 - a generic way to just send a message and
122:34 - it's going to go to the background
122:35 - script and I can make the message an
122:38 - object and I could say the text is
122:43 - selected text so I want to send that
122:49 - message so now what I'm doing is
122:51 - whenever I select a word send that
122:54 - message to the background script okay
122:56 - we're sending a message to the
122:57 - background script so now I need to write
122:59 - some code in the background script to
123:00 - receive the message and I have that
123:04 - somewhere I'm pretty sure actually this
123:06 - is the easy part because I can use
123:07 - chrome runtime dot on message add
123:12 - listener receiver so I'm going to write
123:17 - a function called receiver which is
123:20 - going to so I now want the background
123:22 - script to just listen for messages so I
123:24 - need to add a listener and that function
123:26 - receiver it takes a bunch of arguments
123:27 - like the request
123:29 - the sender and the send response because
123:33 - if you want to send something back but
123:35 - all I really need to do is look at
123:37 - what's in the request so I think I'm
123:40 - just gonna say console dot log request I
123:43 - just want to see what's in there that's
123:44 - where the message should come in okay
123:46 - save everything save everything close a
123:49 - bunch of scripts save everything save
123:51 - everything go to extensions reload click
123:56 - here oh content script has a syntax
123:59 - error line 10 I always do this I really
124:03 - have a problem with a JavaScript object
124:05 - notation
124:06 - there's no semicolon here I should
124:08 - probably put a semicolon there okay I'm
124:10 - gonna hit refresh and oh wait I have to
124:13 - reload boy how much are you just
124:15 - watching me reload and refresh refresh
124:18 - okay so now I'm gonna click this I see
124:22 - the word majority now the question is if
124:25 - I inspect the background page there it
124:28 - is came in text majority yes so I have
124:32 - now the the message from the content
124:37 - script to the background script okay so
124:40 - now in the background script what I'm
124:42 - actually gonna do is just I'm gonna do
124:44 - something really kind of terrible I'm
124:46 - gonna say let word equal and I'm just
124:51 - give it an empty string I'm gonna say
124:53 - word equals request dot what did I call
124:57 - it text so I'm actually just gonna store
125:01 - the result in a global variable there
125:03 - may be some reason why I don't want to
125:05 - do this but here's why I'm doing this
125:07 - because and actually let's just put
125:09 - something I just want to put something
125:10 - in here here I'm just gonna put coding
125:12 - train on the start word because there is
125:15 - a way that I can access variables from a
125:19 - background script from the pop-up
125:22 - without actually sending a message so in
125:25 - other words and in other words what I
125:26 - can do so of course what I could do is
125:29 - when I open the pop-up again it would
125:31 - make more sense for an open the pop-up
125:33 - to send a message to say the background
125:35 - script asking for the answer or more
125:38 - directly I could just send a message
125:39 - from the pop into content script so all
125:40 - this background syrup is kind of
125:41 - unnecessary
125:42 - but it is a useful trick just to see
125:44 - that I can do this in the content script
125:47 - what I can do hold on here just looking
125:58 - at something it's gonna be an edit point
126:06 - yeah in the content script what I can
126:12 - actually do I'm sorry you know in the
126:13 - pop-up in the pop-up what I can actually
126:16 - do is I can say let word equal chrome
126:22 - dot extension dot get background page so
126:29 - if I say let me actually just say let
126:31 - back wrap BG page so I can actually
126:37 - access the background page and then the
126:40 - word is BG page dot word I think I could
126:45 - just go and access a variable that's
126:47 - within the background pages scope so
126:49 - something that I've emphasized is that
126:51 - the content script the background script
126:52 - the pop-up they all live with our own
126:54 - scope but I can access the background
126:56 - scripts scope and pull variables out so
126:59 - let me do that and I'm all I going to do
127:01 - is say create P word so let's see if
127:05 - I've made a mistake here let's see if
127:07 - this is working and I'm going to close
127:11 - this I'm going to whoop s-- reload this
127:15 - I'm going to refresh this page and I'm
127:18 - just going to click the button whoa
127:20 - undefined so I did something wrong so
127:22 - first of all I forgot that I had some
127:24 - stray code in the index of HTML so I'm
127:27 - gonna say call this word Nick lookup get
127:33 - rid of this so what did I get wrong here
127:36 - chrome extension get back you know I
127:38 - wonder I wonder if let using let is a
127:44 - problem because I wonder if I'm making
127:49 - use of sort of like goofy thing you just
127:53 - let me just make sure this really didn't
127:55 - work because I'm having a problem making
127:56 - sure i refresh yeah it's still saying
128:01 - undefined there so let me just change
128:04 - that to in the background script let me
128:08 - change is the bar
128:11 - let me change this devar let me reload
128:16 - you refresh and do this yeah look at
128:21 - that oh boy I don't like what's going on
128:29 - here I'm gonna look at the slack channel
128:37 - here somebody tell me if what I'm doing
128:39 - is to string dot trim I just need to
128:46 - trim I should also trim the text okay
128:49 - window dot word
128:51 - Thank You Alka all right
129:05 - the problem is here because I'm using
129:07 - Lent which is a wonderful thing
129:09 - let is a wonderful thing but let is
129:13 - locally scoped in a much stronger way
129:16 - than the old var thing with this I don't
129:19 - want to get into that now I've got a
129:20 - whole video about let and var but what I
129:22 - want to do if I really want to make this
129:24 - global Global global which is probably a
129:26 - bad idea I can say window dot word so if
129:31 - I say window dot word and I guess I need
129:34 - to do that here to window dot word I can
129:37 - put something in a more global scope
129:40 - attached to the window object of the
129:42 - background page there's actually this
129:44 - like secret background page the weird
129:45 - thing you don't see it but it's actually
129:46 - a page and so now what I should be able
129:50 - to do is once again reload the page
129:55 - refresh the page I might not need to
129:57 - actually briefer I'm gonna select
129:59 - locomotives I'm gonna do this and then
130:01 - look at that locomotives is there so all
130:04 - I need to do is query word Nick now
130:07 - we're in good shape now I now have what
130:09 - do I have I have a Content script that
130:13 - listens to me selecting some text it
130:16 - sends a message to the background script
130:18 - the background script stores it in a
130:21 - global variable for itself and the
130:23 - pop-up asks the background script for
130:25 - its variable again not a really sort of
130:29 - awkward in elegant way of doing this but
130:31 - to show all these pieces so coming back
130:35 - over here okay one thing I could have
130:44 - said var word by the way but the reason
130:46 - why I'm saying window dot word and
130:48 - actually I wonder once I do that I can
130:50 - probably just do this right I'm saying
130:52 - we know that word cuz I want to avoid
130:53 - using var that's which is sort of silly
130:56 - okay a couple things one is I should
131:00 - trim the text because it can sometimes
131:02 - end up having like whitespace and stuff
131:04 - in it so I'm gonna call dot trim which
131:06 - will get rid of any extra like weird
131:07 - whitespace stuff and now what I need to
131:10 - do is look up the stuff on word Nick so
131:12 - this is a little bit out of this so
131:14 - let's go to the word Nick so I'm gonna
131:17 - go to the word Nick
131:18 - API and I'm gonna go to the
131:22 - documentation what I want is the
131:25 - definition of a word so if I look up a
131:27 - word I can ask for its definitions and
131:30 - let's say I'm looking up the word Apple
131:33 - and I just want one definition I don't
131:36 - care about part of speech include
131:38 - related I don't need include related and
131:41 - I'll take all the sources whatever so
131:45 - I'm gonna try it out so this is the call
131:50 - this is the request URL that I need and
131:53 - then the definition is in an array oh
131:58 - boy
131:59 - Italy the definition is in an array and
132:03 - it comes under text ok so what I'm gonna
132:09 - do is I'm gonna grab this request URL
132:12 - and what I can do in the sketch here I
132:19 - can say let URL equal you know see other
132:28 - people talking in the hallway and
132:30 - actually all I need to do is what I need
132:32 - is I'm gonna split this into two because
132:38 - what I want what happened here oh I need
132:46 - what I need is to put the word in
132:52 - between so this is a kind of awkward way
132:54 - of doing this but I need to form this
132:55 - big URL and actually I should use I
132:58 - should use this es6 thing that's new let
133:01 - me show you this in this video because
133:02 - it would be really useful here I think I
133:04 - could say backtick right someone's gonna
133:06 - help me I'm gonna need some help with
133:07 - this so I'm gonna cuz I'm gonna use I
133:13 - think if I say backtick I'm gonna get
133:15 - rid of all these quotes then there's a
133:21 - way I can actually break it up over
133:23 - multiple lines and just do back tic
133:24 - again right mmm
133:29 - hold on someone's gonna tell me how to
133:31 - do this back tick thing oh yeah and then
133:40 - dollar sign word okay but I seem to have
133:47 - the back tics wrong okay I can use back
133:50 - so something is wrong whoops
133:51 - something is wrong here in that oh I
133:54 - have this here shouldn't be here I
133:57 - thought I could do it over multiple
133:59 - lines let me see if I'm still oh I have
134:02 - too many back tics can I do it over
134:06 - multiple lines I know that's I'm just
134:11 - trying to do it over multiple lines
134:12 - which I guess is silly let me just let
134:14 - me go back
134:32 - yes backtick takes multiple lines all
134:35 - right so let's gonna let's try this is
134:37 - this now this is not something is wrong
134:42 - with this syntax anyway I'll let you are
134:47 - l equals this right what's going on here
134:52 - why is the syntax highlighting so weird
135:03 - oh it's highlighting URL okay thank you
135:05 - okay all right I'm gonna attempt to use
135:08 - a new feature that's part of JavaScript
135:11 - es6
135:12 - which allows me to form a string by
135:17 - embedding the variable inside the string
135:19 - and instead of using single quotes so
135:21 - I'm going to get rid of all of the
135:22 - single quotes and everything's gonna
135:28 - look like a disaster right now get rid
135:31 - of all these single quotes and then I'm
135:33 - gonna use back tick back tick back tick
135:37 - so this should be this is now correct
135:40 - it's a little bit weird leaf syntax
135:42 - highlighted because so just to emphasize
135:45 - that I'm how this is working this is
135:48 - kind of useful I could actually write it
135:49 - like this like I can really see all this
135:53 - stuff so this is really useful to be
135:56 - able to break a URL break a string over
136:01 - multiple lines and what I want to come
136:03 - right after here is that's where I had
136:06 - the word Apple so I can now say I think
136:08 - it's dollar sign bracket curly brackets
136:12 - word so dollar sign curly brackets word
136:16 - this is now like fill in the value of
136:18 - this variable as part of this URL so I
136:21 - should be able to say load JSON that URL
136:25 - then I kind of a callback like got data
136:27 - I can write that function got data one
136:33 - of these days I'll start using the arrow
136:35 - syntax and stuff for an anonymous
136:37 - functions for the callbacks but got data
136:39 - data and then now I just want to say
136:42 - create p data index 0 so if we remember
136:48 - what was here it's data it's an array
136:51 - index 0 dot text so I just wanna get the
136:55 - first definition because I'm only
136:56 - getting one data index 0 dot text so
137:00 - this should be it right now my speak
137:03 - five sketch grabs the word from the
137:05 - background page forms this long URL to
137:09 - request stuff from word neck look uses
137:12 - the p5 load JSON to grab the data and
137:14 - show the
137:15 - salt okay here we go here we go there's
137:19 - got to be something wrong here but so
137:23 - first reload the page refresh this page
137:29 - I'm even gonna get find a word to
137:32 - highlight like number didn't work
137:42 - alright so let's look let's see where
137:43 - things went wrong ah server responded
137:47 - with the status of 404 so what is wrong
137:51 - here let's look at this URL I probably
137:54 - made a mistake in the URL one way for me
137:56 - to do that is just to put it here in
137:58 - atom so let's see HTTP oh look at this I
138:04 - got some weird oh there's an extra
138:07 - semicolon in there that's bad
138:09 - there's also extra spaces how come my
138:12 - trim didn't get rid of the spaces so
138:16 - let's so one thing here is a couple
138:19 - things I need to fix for sure let's go
138:23 - back to my code I had this semicolon the
138:26 - error was just totally unnecessary which
138:28 - is totally messed everything up and
138:30 - let's just trim it here also hi I
138:34 - thought I trimmed it over there but I'm
138:35 - gonna trim it uh it adds new line at the
138:40 - end of the string hmm hmm does it add
138:44 - the new lines or the new lines in there
138:46 - I kind of feel like it's okay I'm gonna
138:50 - I don't think the new lines are gonna be
138:51 - a problem
138:52 - okay oh I might need to replace all
138:55 - right so I'm being told breaking news
138:59 - I'm being told let's just put this in
139:03 - here to be safe
139:04 - replace any new lines with nothing so
139:08 - I'm just putting this on multiple lines
139:10 - just so I can make it more readable but
139:13 - obviously it can be on one line but just
139:15 - in case those new lines are going into
139:17 - the URL and messing it up let's do that
139:19 - all right
139:20 - let's reload the page refresh here
139:27 - I am going to select Railways gonna
139:31 - click here okay look that didn't work
139:35 - but let's see what happens now console
139:38 - the server is well there's like another
139:42 - semicolon look at this there's another
139:44 - semicolon right unauthorized because I
139:50 - stuck a silly extra semicolon so many
139:55 - semicolons oh that didn't work so let's
140:02 - get rid of these spaces that I don't
140:03 - know why they're in there I might have
140:07 - to do my own trim API word Nick page
140:10 - cannot be found is it HTTP so why is
140:16 - this not working
140:17 - oh there's other weird Oh the spaces are
140:21 - because of the new they're not from the
140:24 - trim they're from the new line that's
140:29 - all these spaces are being added these
140:32 - are spaces I'm really losing
140:35 - so let's actually make this a regular
140:38 - expression this is so weird you know
140:40 - what I'm gonna do so I can fix this but
140:42 - I probably just put it all in one line
140:44 - hope you so much better what if this is
140:46 - such a coding trainwreck but what I'm
140:48 - gonna do is I'll make a regular
140:49 - expression that takes any new line or
140:53 - any any white spaces new line of
140:56 - whitespace any whitespace any amount of
141:00 - white space and replaces it with nothing
141:04 - let's try this reload refresh select
141:13 - number inspector that's all semicolon is
141:22 - still there
141:22 - Oh cuz I didn't get rid of the semicolon
141:24 - ah all right
141:26 - one word try well I'm gonna try come on
141:28 - everybody
141:30 - this is gonna work I don't know what to
141:35 - play I'd have nothing to play I'm
141:39 - feeling good about this a little dizzy
141:41 - all of a sudden okay all right
141:43 - reload the extension are you with me
141:46 - refresh the page select number boy I'm
141:57 - really bad at debugging this I really
141:59 - should probably probably got to be much
142:00 - more careful yeah oh there's still some
142:04 - white space so why is the white space
142:08 - still in there alright cuz the new line
142:16 - can I do this so get the chat oh I need
142:23 - the global I need the global flag I need
142:27 - to go thank you breaking news I'm being
142:31 - told that I've forgotten that regular
142:34 - expressions when you use the replace
142:36 - function they only replace the first
142:38 - thing you find and let's use the global
142:40 - flag so I'm gonna go back to white space
142:44 - any white space replace it and and if
142:48 - this doesn't work I'm putting it all in
142:49 - one line okay you can't stop me I'm
142:51 - gonna put it all it wasn't
143:02 - here we go here we go everybody here we
143:07 - go here we go and go back and I'm gonna
143:12 - go reload I'm gonna go to the steam
143:16 - locomotive page and I'm gonna select
143:20 - locomotive I press this button a
143:25 - [Music]
143:32 - self-propelled vehicle usually electric
143:35 - or diesel-powered for pulling or pushing
143:37 - Freight or passenger cars on railroad
143:39 - tracks so now I can go over here and I
143:43 - can open up the and I can see here for
143:45 - early and one thing I would like to do
143:48 - is I would just like to say dot style
143:51 - font size 64 now I wonder if all I'm
143:57 - doing is changing the pop-up so I have
144:00 - to reload the whole I probably reload
144:01 - the whole extension right 64 point let's
144:04 - make it like 48 point is it text size or
144:07 - font size I just want it to be bigger I
144:09 - just I just wanted to be I assume yeah
144:13 - look at that so interesting enough if
144:15 - I'm just changing the code in the pop-up
144:18 - I don't need to I don't need to actually
144:23 - need to reload the whole extension
144:24 - because it's kind of loading that on the
144:25 - fly which is weird how that works and
144:29 - also this is not real how do I make the
144:32 - size bigger of the actual pop-up that's
144:37 - probably I'm too tired to do that
144:39 - somebody will write it in the comments :
144:42 - timeout timeout I'm gonna go away first
144:44 - I gotta come back how do I make the
144:48 - pop-up bigger please add text if heading
144:51 - also can you leave pop-up open until
144:53 - manually closed the information about
144:59 - Newcastle's incorrect like can I just do
145:03 - something like body like what determines
145:06 - the oh because oh I know the pay okay
145:14 - that's so I'm pretty sure that if I want
145:18 - that pop-up to be bigger to give me more
145:20 - space it's actually going to dynamically
145:22 - size it based on what it is when the
145:24 - page first loads but because I'm getting
145:26 - the data from Wernick later
145:28 - um it's not resizing so I could probably
145:31 - say body and then do something like with
145:35 - window resize by oh I could do window
145:40 - resize I so like I don't know if you
145:43 - guys would know who knows CSS would know
145:45 - this stuff better like can I do
145:47 - something like this and this has to be
145:50 - in a style tag according to my research
145:56 - according to my excellent research I
145:58 - don't need to reload the extension
146:00 - refresh the page yes oh look at that
146:03 - there we go so now I can click on
146:06 - locomotive and I get that I can click on
146:10 - America and I get United States I can
146:12 - click on obtain now again this is like
146:15 - the worst most Awkward interaction
146:18 - somehow if you're still watching this
146:20 - video first of all thank you they really
146:24 - appreciate it this has been a big
146:26 - struggle for me even though I made an
146:28 - example like this two years ago this is
146:29 - quite hard to do on the fly live even
146:31 - though you're seeing kind of an edited
146:32 - version of this I did do this live but I
146:36 - would like you to think about what is a
146:37 - more elegant interaction how might you
146:40 - want to augment someone's browsing
146:42 - experience to learn about additional
146:45 - context so this could actually be a
146:47 - practical tool or you could just do
146:48 - something kind of goofy and when you
146:50 - select a word you know it shows you it
146:52 - maybe shows you an image associating so
146:54 - I look forward to I will share some
146:57 - Chrome extensions next time I come back
146:59 - on a live stream of people who have like
147:02 - made more elegant interactions so please
147:04 - write your send me a link to your Chrome
147:07 - extension in the comments or tweet me at
147:08 - Schiffman something like that but this
147:10 - is certainly the end of this video thank
147:16 - you and good night
147:21 - [Music]
147:23 - fade out
147:24 - [Music]
147:43 - okay so I at 6:30 I think I'm done I put
147:48 - a fork I did not get two things that I
147:51 - wanted to do let's look at our list
147:55 - let's look at my list but I did
147:58 - persevere and get through kind of in a
148:01 - way everything I wanted to do about
148:03 - Chrome extensions I would love to do a
148:06 - Chrome extension that like just modifies
148:08 - people's tweets and as some so something
148:11 - nice to you but I'm not gonna do that
148:13 - right now so I uh brow okay I am NOT
148:18 - leaving I would it be here for a little
148:23 - bit longer against my better judgment
148:26 - I'm gonna do Firefox so first of all do
148:30 - I even have Firefox on this computer I
148:33 - have no idea how to do this no no don't
148:37 - import anything no don't make it the
148:41 - default so just looking at this am I
148:44 - like you know way out of date
148:49 - am I in a way out of date version or
148:52 - anything my firefox is out of date
148:55 - update Firefox about Firefox wait hold
149:08 - on about fire will open firefighters
149:12 - begin checking for updates and
149:13 - downloading them automatically Oh
149:20 - [Music]
149:26 - should be updating it right you should
149:31 - doing it
149:34 - what's the quantum thing should I try
149:37 - that quantum thing isn't there like a
149:38 - quantum quantum let's get quantum I mean
149:42 - quantum leap maybe Scott Bakula will
149:45 - show up fifty seven what house really ha
150:04 - I have 57 replace
150:19 - Oh No
150:49 - - Schiffman browser extension
150:55 - [Music]
151:17 - [Music]
151:28 - [Music]
151:35 - this video I think we should do this
151:37 - with no editing
151:39 - doesn't matter how long takes me how
151:41 - much how much I need from the chat if I
151:47 - do this I think I can be done with
151:48 - Chrome extensions I could always come
151:50 - back to it but
152:08 - [Music]
152:21 - [Music]
152:28 - [Music]
152:31 - all right
152:35 - hello I'm very excited to do this video
152:38 - for you it's a little bit scary because
152:40 - I'm going to attempt to do something
152:42 - this video that I have no idea how to do
152:44 - and I've never looked at it before but I
152:47 - did receive this tweet from Nicholas who
152:51 - writes hey Daniel could you say browser
152:53 - or web extension most of the major
152:55 - browsers have the same set of api's so
152:57 - making a cross browser extension is
152:59 - easily doable see this link so it is
153:04 - true that this idea of ending a Chrome
153:09 - extension is not something limited to
153:12 - the Chrome browser and I've been saying
153:14 - Chrome extension all this time because
153:16 - it's what I was familiar what I'm
153:18 - familiar with and what I've used before
153:19 - but this idea of an extension is can be
153:24 - thought of in a larger broader way as a
153:27 - browser extension there is a uniform
153:30 - standard API from the Mozilla Foundation
153:36 - we can look at it here for a browser
153:38 - extensions so could I possibly in this
153:41 - video take one of my extensions I made
153:45 - like the kitten one and just make it
153:47 - work in Firefox as a browser extension
153:49 - this is what I'm going to attempt to do
153:53 - and I hope that people you you might be
153:56 - watching this as a Reddit 'add version
153:59 - but this is happening live and I'm
154:01 - really relying on the chat there's a
154:02 - YouTube chat and there's a slack channel
154:05 - going on here and I'm gonna follow and
154:09 - watch okay so what do i do first
154:11 - anybody have evidence so your first
154:13 - extension let's look at that I think I
154:15 - could skipped what are extensions oh oh
154:17 - so I need a manifest.json hey look at
154:19 - this it looks like I've done
154:23 - so actually I have a feeling I don't
154:26 - know if the chicken or the egg came
154:28 - first but I do know that I like I like a
154:31 - vegetarian omelet it's quite delicious
154:35 - now I can't be vegan obviously because
154:38 - eggs aren't but anyway I just I like
154:39 - vegetables
154:40 - that's am I really talking about that
154:42 - now no but this looks like so much so
154:44 - let me just go get my let's what is it
154:46 - possible that I could just run by
154:48 - extension in Firefox I don't actually
154:50 - recode it at all so let's go to all the
154:52 - these are all the extensions that I made
154:55 - with the exception of the first was a
154:56 - bookmark content script background
154:58 - script to kittens one the sketch one the
155:00 - pop ups let's try the kittens one i'm
155:04 - let's try the kids one so i'm gonna just
155:06 - make it a new folder whoops i'm gonna
155:10 - copy it and i'm gonna call it 0:08
155:15 - browser kittens just i want to kids have
155:19 - to change some aspects of it let's leave
155:21 - that so it's just a content script with
155:24 - a kittens a folder of kittens and a
155:27 - manifesto JSON alright so let's see here
155:32 - how do I load an extension extensions
155:36 - Firefox colon extensions that doesn't
155:41 - work add-ons for Firefox where do I go
155:45 - so these are extensions I can get how do
155:47 - I add a developer one somebody I'm
155:50 - waiting for something that's fat to tell
155:52 - me cross browser kittens everybody
155:55 - should make cross browser cute wonderful
155:57 - kids I'm looking I'm waiting
156:00 - [Music]
156:02 - all right I'm gonna look myself unpacked
156:08 - extension firefox open firefox enter
156:14 - about debugging in the URL bar click
156:17 - load temporary add-on so that seems like
156:19 - what I have to do about debugging yeah
156:24 - there we go
156:24 - enable add-on debugging sure load
156:28 - temporary add-on kittens
156:31 - where to kittens where the kids desktop
156:34 - extensions browser kittens open open no
156:38 - no do I just select a manifesto JSON
156:41 - file alright yeah it's there the KO it
156:44 - says chrome that's the worst so let me
156:46 - at least fix that let me go to the
156:49 - manifesto JSON and say browser this is
156:53 - now a browser X kitchen and if you want
156:56 - to watch the video where I programmed
156:59 - this extension I'll link to it in this
157:01 - video's description so now let me reload
157:05 - and then it should be running how about
157:11 - just go to Schiffman net oh it worked
157:18 - good look kittens kittens everywhere
157:21 - kittens
157:22 - it worked so what's nice to see here and
157:28 - actually it's nice to that that this is
157:32 - an open standard that this idea of an
157:35 - extension you can look at the chrome
157:38 - specific API the documentation and make
157:41 - chrome extensions but your code for the
157:44 - most part without and perhaps some minor
157:46 - changes I'm sure I mean this is a very
157:47 - simplistic extension but so there might
157:50 - be other things you can look at this
157:53 - mozilla documentation page to create
157:57 - cross browser extensions cross browser
158:01 - kittens for all so i hope you enjoyed
158:03 - them it has now become a very short
158:05 - video i would be happy to load my other
158:08 - extensions and see how that works let's
158:09 - just at least load one that has a button
158:11 - let's so now i'm going to be ambitious
158:13 - and i'm just going to say
158:15 - load I'm gonna load one that I made for
158:19 - looking up words and getting their
158:22 - definitions from word necks I'm gonna
158:23 - open up this one and I guess I have to
158:26 - within Chrome I select the folder looks
158:29 - like I select the manifesto JSON file so
158:32 - word look up now you can see look my
158:34 - button is there and I can go to let's go
158:39 - to a Wikipedia page for like rainbow and
158:44 - they're still replacing things with cats
158:47 - look I don't have a kitten here and I'm
158:50 - gonna select sky click here and look at
158:54 - that the expanse of air over any given
158:57 - point on the earth the upper atmosphere
158:58 - as seen from the earth service so I'm
159:00 - really discipline some ways I was a
159:02 - disappointed with myself but that's
159:04 - probably the right thing to say right
159:06 - here but I I prowl I wish that I had
159:09 - sort of started with this knowledge and
159:11 - from this point of view because as much
159:13 - as possible I like to use generic and
159:15 - open tools that can be applied to a lot
159:18 - of different things like different
159:21 - browsers or different operating systems
159:23 - but so but hopefully this is this video
159:26 - allows you to see if you want to do one
159:29 - of your extensions for a different
159:30 - browser you can all you can do that so
159:32 - thank you all for watching and I will
159:35 - see you in another time in another video
159:36 - maybe maybe if if you want you could uh
159:38 - yeah okay no no that's fine don't don't
159:41 - just just go on with your day wait wow I
159:49 - can't believe how easy that was alright
159:55 - everybody
159:55 - it is 6:40 how long has this livestream
159:58 - been QA I am happy to do a QA for a bit
160:02 - for a short amount of time I need to
160:05 - read some more of the random number book
160:07 - and then I need to go and I won't be
160:12 - back for two weeks because of
160:14 - Thanksgiving next week unless I can come
160:18 - up with a way to do a little something
160:19 - before two weeks from now but I will be
160:21 - back in two weeks
160:23 - try microsoft recommends some cool
160:25 - create or recommend some cool creative
160:28 - coding books I would love
160:29 - - so my go-to resource for that is
160:32 - probably props where I start with start
160:34 - with reprocessing org books gonna be
160:36 - kittens you should probably disable that
160:39 - extension as fun as it is remove how do
160:47 - I it's funny it doesn't look like you
160:49 - can enable and disable I just have to
160:51 - like remove it so this is a good
160:57 - resource for you to start with some
160:58 - creative coding books some that I this
161:01 - is one that I really really love
161:02 - generator design some other books that
161:05 - I've been recently looking at are this
161:12 - is a wonderful book ten print a history
161:14 - of computing and creative computing
161:16 - through the lens of one line of code
161:18 - from the Commodore 64 forth and code is
161:22 - a wonderful book a form and code this is
161:29 - a wonderful book forming code and design
161:31 - and code and design art and architecture
161:33 - a book that I love I wish I had my
161:35 - bookshelf behind me because I could sort
161:36 - of just look through it I mean Lauren
161:38 - McCarthy is getting started with p5.js
161:40 - book which is a port of K series and Ben
161:42 - Fry's book is is great for just getting
161:44 - started with p5.js pretty quickly and
161:47 - then Nick Montfort has a book this is
161:50 - like exploratory programming for the
161:52 - humanities or something something like
161:59 - that exploratory programming for the
162:02 - arts and humanities this is a really
162:03 - nice one as well is there a good
162:13 - resource for creating a I&J s
162:17 - thank you for asking that question what
162:19 - I would say to you right now for those
162:23 - of you who are interested go to deep
162:26 - learn j/s org take a look at that and I
162:31 - really hesitate to show this to you
162:32 - because it's very much in progress but a
162:34 - bunch of us at ITP are working on
162:37 - something called p5 deep learn
162:39 - Chancellor this is the URL for that
162:42 - github.com slash ITP NYU p5 - deep learn
162:46 - is this is something we're working on to
162:48 - allow you to do machine learning in this
162:51 - is new KN image classifier that's like
162:53 - wasn't even there this morning and this
162:56 - is what I'm planning been working on
162:58 - this and I suggest you look at the
163:01 - contributors there's been other folks
163:05 - that are contributing to this and this
163:07 - is something that I hope you do a lot of
163:08 - video tutorials with starting in the new
163:10 - year so if you want to get a preview of
163:11 - this and start to look at it you are
163:13 - welcome to do so I would also recommend
163:16 - you take a look at teachable machines
163:18 - which is a project from Google Creative
163:20 - Lab and I plan on maybe using this
163:25 - teachable machines demo in some videos
163:28 - to explain certain machine learning
163:29 - concepts as well hello hello Dan I want
163:37 - to ask I recently graduated and
163:39 - struggling to find a job due to lack of
163:41 - experience I want to pursue software or
163:43 - web development any tips so first I'd
163:46 - like to say is that I don't know that
163:48 - I'm really qualified to answer that
163:49 - question because I'm a little out of the
163:53 - in my own world of making these YouTube
163:56 - tutorials and teaching classes but I
163:58 - will say that from my experience of
164:00 - working with the processing foundation
164:02 - and looking for projects to try to
164:04 - support or participate in that looking
164:08 - at somebody's web presence and their
164:10 - github repositories and how how they
164:14 - document their work is a really
164:17 - important thing so for me often one
164:20 - thing you might think about I mean a
164:21 - resume and your skills and maybe where
164:23 - you went to school and grades or some of
164:25 - those things that you usually think
164:27 - about these are the things that I need
164:28 - to apply for a job
164:30 - but how you and if it's not real and how
164:33 - you document and write about and explain
164:37 - your thinking and process not just your
164:39 - projects and things you've made so not
164:41 - just like look at all of my code but
164:43 - actually look at how I document and
164:45 - explain my code this is a really
164:47 - valuable skill and I think it really
164:49 - shows your it can really show your show
164:56 - your talents in a nice and open generous
164:59 - way so to me that's something that I
165:01 - think can be I aspire to do a good job
165:03 - of and that's something that that that
165:05 - maybe would help so and in that sense
165:08 - maybe getting involved in some open
165:10 - source projects which can sometimes feel
165:12 - scary or maybe it's not for you or
165:14 - you're not welcome or son included are
165:15 - you're gonna say the wrong thing and
165:17 - it's tricky and I would love as much as
165:20 - I can to help with that I certainly
165:21 - would encourage you to get involved with
165:23 - p5.js or processing foundation projects
165:25 - and tweet at me if you're not sure how
165:28 - to do that and hopefully this is
165:30 - something that I could do more on this
165:31 - channel to help get more people involved
165:38 - yeah alessandro asks a similar question
165:43 - low tip asks how do you would you
165:46 - structure an intro uni course for
165:49 - complete news so i don't want to I mean
165:52 - this is like you guys are like feeding
165:53 - me questions to like promote my own
165:55 - stuff but this is in terms of how I
165:58 - would do that is if you look at the
166:02 - learning processing and it's the
166:05 - learning processing book this book is
166:08 - how I think about that I mean it's a
166:10 - it's a you know I probably have new
166:11 - thoughts about this but this is the
166:13 - second edition this is the way that I
166:15 - teach programming here at ITP I'm not
166:18 - actually using this book because this is
166:20 - for the processing programming
166:21 - environment and we're teaching with
166:22 - JavaScript now I'm so getting started
166:24 - with p5.js there's a great book for you
166:26 - to look at for inspiration also but if
166:28 - you're interested you could at least you
166:29 - could also look at our syllabus right
166:33 - which is a github calm slash ITP NYU
166:38 - slash
166:41 - I see em 2017 so this is um this is kind
166:47 - of a outline of the syllabus of what we
166:48 - do in this course I will say that other
166:50 - programs do things in different ways of
166:52 - Boorman art focus and actually cadenza
166:54 - which is a online education company has
166:57 - a course called introduction to visual
166:58 - programming for the arts or something
167:00 - like that that's taught by Lauren
167:02 - McCarthy Casey Reese and Chandler
167:04 - McWilliams and so that that course also
167:06 - is a great model I think and okay Oh
167:11 - shadow plays as asked how's your arm
167:13 - doing thank you for asking it's actually
167:15 - doing really quite well can you even
167:17 - look at me right now do you know which
167:18 - elbow I broke maybe you don't even know
167:20 - it is the right side if I did this now
167:23 - you would know I cannot I cannot bend
167:26 - the right arm fully straight but I can
167:28 - get pretty good extension this is called
167:31 - flexion extension and I have a nice
167:34 - exciting looking scar that I don't know
167:36 - if you can see it but I'm getting
167:38 - stronger I'm feeling much better and
167:39 - thank you for asking
167:44 - are you teaching computer programming
167:47 - class with j/s so I'm gonna wrap this up
167:50 - in a second but yes so I teach at a
167:52 - program called ITP it's part of Tisch
167:55 - School of the Arts at New York
167:56 - University this is the web site it
167:58 - actually says ITP and ima because
168:00 - starting in fall 2018 the undergraduate
168:03 - BFA version of ITP called Interactive
168:06 - Media Arts will be accepting its
168:07 - inaugural class so there's still I think
168:08 - the deadline is not till December first
168:10 - so if you're looking for something to
168:12 - apply to and if you want more
168:13 - information you can tweet at me at
168:14 - Schiffman but this is where I teach so I
168:17 - teach I'm teaching three classes right
168:18 - now it's very hard and it's the end of
168:20 - the semester it's really busy but doing
168:23 - this YouTube channel is really fun for
168:24 - me and rewarding I'm trying to do my
168:27 - best and so I yeah and right so that's
168:32 - usually how I end up picking the content
168:34 - is I'm kind of do video tutorials on the
168:37 - things that I'm teaching at ITP so that
168:39 - I can publish those videos for the
168:41 - students at ITP and also make them
168:42 - publicly available yes so in the course
168:47 - that I'm teaching right now if you want
168:49 - to look for more information is that
168:51 - Schiffman net
168:53 - a twosie I'm gonna take one more
168:55 - question which I don't even see I'm
168:58 - gonna check that so I actually just
169:01 - completely forgot to look at the slack
169:02 - channel again if you want to support the
169:05 - work that I'm doing with a financial
169:07 - contribution which is not at all
169:08 - required it's only if you have the means
169:11 - and feel inclined to do so it's super
169:13 - appreciated but I want to make this
169:15 - accessible for anybody but you can go to
169:17 - patreon.com/scishow coding trained arm
169:20 - extensions
169:25 - alright so Oh chinatown asks in chat
169:33 - just starting to learn code what should
169:35 - i do first I mean there's umpteen ways
169:38 - that I can answer this question and I
169:40 - could point you towards lots of
169:41 - resources that aren't my own which are
169:43 - very good first of all let me just shout
169:45 - out the code newbies podcast
169:47 - I think code newbies is a podcast which
169:51 - is probably one of the friendliest and
169:53 - most welcoming communities they have a
169:56 - Sarang Sarang yet Barik who runs this
170:01 - podcast also started a new CS concepts
170:04 - podcast I've been listening to which is
170:05 - awesome and so I definitely encourage
170:09 - you to check out code newbies but in
170:12 - terms of my youtube channel if I go to
170:16 - youtube.com slash Schiffman this is the
170:22 - playlist for getting started from the
170:24 - beginning so I would encourage you to
170:27 - use that if you want to follow my
170:29 - channel there is also by the way you can
170:31 - also follow this playlist which is also
170:34 - totally from scratch but it's a much
170:36 - older playlist using just a different
170:38 - program there I'm gonna called
170:38 - processing but those would be the two
170:40 - places on my channel to start okay thank
170:47 - you well hello to Brazil Thank You
170:49 - Malvin the waiting music is by Adam Blau
170:54 - I can't hear it
170:55 - atuh Blau on twitter who also wrote the
170:57 - cutting train theme song which is this
171:03 - thing so if you play while I grabbed a
171:11 - random number book so I don't have any
171:23 - plans to remake the processing tutorials
171:29 - but that is an interesting idea I mean
171:33 - in theory I would love to give an
171:35 - infinite time I definitely would but the
171:37 - thing is most of them are still valid
171:39 - that the quality is not so great and but
171:43 - alright why a lot of viewers from Brazil
171:52 - alright I'm just going to read the first
171:55 - two paragraphs of the introduction early
171:59 - in the course of research at the RAND
172:00 - Corporation a demand arose for random
172:03 - numbers these were needed to solve
172:04 - problems of various kinds by
172:06 - experimental probability procedures
172:08 - which have come to be called Monte Carlo
172:10 - methods many of the applications
172:12 - required a large supply of random digits
172:14 - or normal deviance of high quality and
172:16 - the tables presented here were produced
172:19 - to meet those requirements the numbers
172:21 - have been used extensively by research
172:23 - workers at Rand and by many others in
172:25 - the solution of a wide range of problems
172:27 - during the past seven years now when it
172:30 - says the past seven years the original
172:38 - book was published in 1955 so I assume
172:42 - it's referring to the years between 1948
172:46 - and 1955 alright it's all I have the
172:50 - energy for a Ricardo says the majority
172:56 - here just like this random number
172:57 - reading thing and but first of all I
173:00 - usually try to just do it at the end so
173:01 - you can always just tune it out and it's
173:04 - a little personal challenge to myself so
173:06 - you can humor me but I don't know if
173:08 - that's really true either
173:13 - let's do something unscientific here and
173:23 - create this poll I'm gonna vote yes and
173:29 - you can vote yourself with that URL and
173:35 - I will listen a couple couple more
173:39 - questions
173:41 - [Music]
173:52 - I'm looking for more questions Simon
173:55 - it's time for you to go to sleep Alvin
174:03 - asks about the ITP show it is the ITP
174:08 - show is December set let's look it up
174:11 - ITP dot NYU dot edu slash show December
174:20 - 17th and December 18th I should be here
174:24 - at both so please say hi if you come
174:28 - [Music]
174:34 - Jenner of synthesis music in p5 I did a
174:38 - video a little bit about that but not so
174:45 - I should do more
174:47 - [Music]
174:53 - oh boy this song is a minute and a half
174:56 - left should I learn p5 before native
174:59 - JavaScript which one should I go for a
175:00 - first I mean you're kind of asking the
175:03 - wrong person because most people won't
175:06 - answer the question the way that I'll
175:07 - answer it but I think learning p5
175:12 - starting with the p5 library is a nice
175:14 - entry point to learning the basics of
175:17 - programming and from there you could
175:19 - investigate native JavaScript at the
175:20 - same time afterwards during but just
175:23 - having the sort of simplicity of the p5
175:25 - environment it's you know if you're just
175:27 - in graphics and animation and beginner
175:29 - friendly stuff and making art that's
175:30 - what I would start with I'm a computer
175:37 - science major and my biggest problem is
175:39 - just how to solve the purp the problem
175:41 - not the coding itself did this ever
175:43 - happen to you all the time yes
175:46 - definitely it's really hard is p5 just
175:53 - the environment to program JavaScript
175:54 - for and kind of use the exact same code
175:56 - and just you can you have to make sure
175:57 - you import the libraries someone's
176:01 - asking if I plan any meetups I did
176:03 - attend processing day which was really
176:05 - fun I hope to you know so I hope I try
176:08 - to announce if I'm gonna be in a
176:09 - conference or anything I don't I would
176:11 - love I love the idea of doing more live
176:13 - events but I'm not so sure how to make
176:16 - that happen how many hours till the
176:21 - video on-demand abyss is uploaded it
176:22 - actually will be available immediately
176:24 - but it usually is usually available
176:26 - immediately unlisted so if you want the
176:31 - link it's pretty easy to find or you can
176:34 - tweet it me or something but once I have
176:35 - the description everything written it'll
176:37 - be released as public sometime this
176:38 - weekend probably alright
176:58 - you guys are the greatest even that many
177:01 - votes but
177:04 - [Applause]
177:17 - okay thank you everybody we could
177:23 - refresh the results everybody's gone
177:26 - everybody's asleep my throat hurts been
177:29 - talking for three hours straight it's
177:31 - seven o'clock thank you everybody for
177:34 - tuning in to this today is coding trade
177:36 - I won't see you again for two weeks at
177:38 - least live on YouTube all these videos
177:40 - will get published though slowly over
177:41 - time the edited versions and I'm on
177:43 - Twitter although I think I probably
177:45 - should get off Twitter and join Mastodon
177:47 - because Twitter is kind of an awful
177:49 - place
177:49 - but for the moment I'm still there at
177:52 - Schiffman and this laptop died have to
177:55 - plug it back in and so thank you alright
178:02 - goodbye everybody I will play you and
178:05 - anybody anybody want to watch the
178:06 - trailer on the way out now I'm just
178:07 - gonna industry okay thank you everyone

Cleaned transcript:

hello happy Friday greetings from live from New York University here at the Tisch Gillooly hearts it's me Daniel Shipman and I am here on the coding train to dude wait as I am most every Friday in this strange room which is actually just a closet with some filing cabinets and a couple computers but I'm here to talk about code and do some coding stuff and be with you the people of the internet and that's what I'm here for so if you've never watched before might I suggest something else to do you know tea is lovely to drink meditation is good I like listening to music board games I am a big fan of board games card games or excellent going outside and just playing like with a frisbee I don't know I always use frisbee as an example personally I like I'm not kind of like a baseball throw the baseball catch the baseball musicaltheater find somewhere that has musical theater and go watch and listen and be filled with joy with music and dance and song because if you are here just watching this video it's just gonna be me and my computer over here it's not beer as well okay so what's going on today is the usual Friday there's about 4 p.m. Eastern Time one thing I wanted to mention is I'm now trying to alternate morning versus afternoon my time because I know that right now hopefully you're sleeping and not actually watching this but some of some of my international viewers this is quite a late slash middle of the night time so everything I do gets preserved by the glorious thing that is the YouTube it will archive it I also save my own personal backup of the livestream and you can always watch it back later so what's going to happen today I am would first like to cover some business which is my handy dandy guide to what's happening on the Kotick train there it is so you can go to this URL which is github.com slash coding train slash rainbow code in this readme there are some key links for you for example the YouTube channel the coding train how you can become a I think I should say become a patron like the service is patreon but the people are patrons so if you'd like to support what I'm doing in a financial way you can sign up become a patron and depending on different levels I will sometimes if I'm going to get around to it send you something in the mail you will also get an invitation to this slack channel which I am looking at right now where people are telling me to make sure ah that I stay hydrated because as you know coding train is brought to you by water you can drink it and then sometimes later you might have to go can I say I can I say can I say pee pee on YouTube is that okay I'm not sure alright boy let me tell you ever since I got this water sponsorship it's just been amazing here I mean I've never my life has totally changed so you can suggest the topic it's kind of true that suggesting topical it just goes through this giant list of stuff that I almost never get to but I aspire someday I will figure out how to make this suggest a topic system work if I had a good system for upvoting or something maybe at least once per week I could pull something from there but right now I've just got stuff I'm trying to get to Oh the holidays are coming up what could be better for your family friends the significant other person and then a coding train tshirt or membership to the patreon or a mug anyway there's nothing you could buy whatever don't worry about it if you want to it's there is there mmmhmm so that's all I have to say about that now this is my schedule of my future live streams I am trying to have a schedule since I can't have a regular weekly time what I at least would like to do is lay out a schedule in advance and so this is what this is today Friday November 17th 400 p.m. I really need to go to the eye doctor it's terrible it's like it's either too far or too close I can't just go like this I have to take my glasses off oh okay some one of these days I think I really think I also need some more colorful glasses like something bright purple is really thick or something like that to be more stylish than I already am because that's you know I'm quite I mean this is like you know I am like totally with it with the whole YouTube thing being like you know super YouTube creator style person right I'm so old to be on YouTube okay now I'm looking at this what else oh so this is my schedule this computer doesn't have a power plug so everyone's wrong I have to so this is some stuff I'm gonna do today next week is a holiday here in the country where I live called Thanksgiving so I will not be having a live stream on Friday November 24th in fact this building where I broadcast from will be completely closed so even if I wanted to I could not get in here so the next live stream will unfortunately be two weeks from now but I have planning some bonus dates I did miss a date when I had a bad cold in November so right now tentatively speaking Wednesday December 13th I don't know if I take these topics too seriously we're probably gonna change them because things are changing in my mind I should also mention that especially here in New York you should come to this in person but if I go to ITP NYU edu slash show [Laughter] I should just always have this kitten Chrome extension so this is by the way I forgot that last week let me just look at this here are there even kittens here no there's not a kitten there anyway oh yeah look my profile picture is like some sort of kitten I forgot that last week I did a let's see if we refresh the page a different kid oh sorry it's very distracting the kittens but I did a chrome extension to changed any pictures to kittens so maybe I need to just turn that off briefly here for a second there we go let's disable that now I could come back to this website if you are here in New York Sunday December 17th from 200 to 600 p.m. and Monday December 18th from 400 to 800 p.m. you can come visit and see all 100 plus projects made by ITP master students all semester long they'll be showing their work I will be here I will also like I have done in previous shows do a livestream from my mobile device with some kind of ridiculous selfie stick thing oh my god even worse than saying P is saying sucks it's one of those I have one of those things that's got like a smoothing thing in it it helps you balance out whatever it is that you're holding so I will do a livestream about show you project from the show as well and this reminds me another announcement that I would like to make in addition to teaching here at NYU in ITP I am also involved with the processing foundation you might be you might remember the processing foundation from such it's as p5.js or processing py but one thing I wanted to mention is the fellowship program the open call for the fellowships or 2018 is now live processing foundation is a notforprofit we have a small limited budget and most of the things that we do are volunteer driven but this is one of the program run where we fund with a stipend speculative projects that can reimagine what processing can do as software and as a community so I encourage you to look at past fellowships you can see Cassie here who's the creator of the p5.js web editor Andrews also worked on the web at her DIY girls which is an organization in California got free Justin Raspberry Pi stuff Nicholas who did some work in South Africa with kids who didn't have any experience with computers at all Saskia has been teaching stuff in London Susan who did a program about teaching p5 in prisons and these are even so previous ones Alison and Clare except so take a look at this you can see what kind of projects we've funded in the past and if you're interested in applying you can just click here and I believe it'll take you to a Google Form and hopefully most of that is selfexplanatory but if you have questions about that you can reach out to me at Schiffman on twitter also at processing org is the official processing foundation twitter sometimes weird noises happen in here and i don't know if you hear them or just me but it was if somebody above me dropped a sort of like jar full of marbles like rolling around or else I'm losing my mind more than I already a.m. all right so what am I gonna do today apparently at some point I put all this stuff on this list so I would like to finish off I mean nothing is ever finished but I would like to at least complete what I had set out to do about Chrome extensions so I want to add I want to do a tutorial how that how to add a pop up to a Chrome extension I forgot what this is called somebody in the chat somebody in the chat actually okay Austin is giving me a good point I want to I should mention some things about the patreon rewards if people are curious Andre the chat asks do you have any good JavaScript tutorials well I definitely have JavaScript tutorials do I have good ones not so sure about that but if they have them and maybe you like them so yeah just just to answer a question here and everyone while I try to look at the live chat it's very difficult to follow but I might as well mention if you are a beginner and you've never programmed before there are plenty of resources beyond what I offer here on the coding train but the playlist you're looking for is this one foundations of programming in JavaScript so this is a playlist if I click on it oh no it's go surprise video I'm in an ad let's play a video for our new undergraduate program here it's very meta everything's very meta here but this is the playlist you want to look at there was something I wanted to mention about this which is if there's time today I need I want to continue yeah these videos these once I get to 7.6 I'm still using an older way of creating objects in JavaScript so I there's three to do videos here that I need to redo so I got to come back to that what was I talking about so the Chrome extension stuff I want to do on Twitter I'm gonna look up this tweet someone tweeted me very helpful information and you know it's it's my fault really just think about I you know the Chrome extensions is something that I encountered a while ago and used and talked with them but the concept of a browser extension beyond just simply the Chrome browser is a thing that exists and you can make extensions for other browsers in a more open way as well so I want to see if I can at least touch on that I want to revisit the current state of WebGL and p5 maybe do a little tutorial see how that is and moro P&J s and yeah definitely I term will be getting that very soon and and this is a new thing that I've been doing do I have this working I don't think I have this maybe I'll go through the steps to install this No so I'm really excited about machine learning ai stuff is coming to this channel I but what the two things I'm excited about one is I've been doing a lot of work recently with this library and in fact I met with the creators of the library yesterday Nikhil for at and Daniel smell cough who are amazing this is a JavaScript library for doing deep learning in the browser and I am working on a whole bunch of examples that I will go through and talk about on this channel very soon I'm gonna be updating a lot of my previous machine learning stuff using this library so that's coming the other thing that I have figured out to do which is kind of fun is any Python script torch script something that you can run and do via the command line I have a kind of a generic example for how to use nodejs to run that script and send the results to your p5 sketch so on the one hand I want to be able to do some of these algorithms right there in the browser themselves but if I need to run this algorithm as a separate script in a different programming language your environment I can use know to connect those two things so whether I get to that today or not is kind of an open question but that's my plan so that's my introduction 15 minutes I am going to I am going to now take the time at the beginning usually I say this for the end but I feel it's important to continue my work reading the entire book a million random digits with a hundred thousand normal deviates last time I made it through the forward I don't think I read the table of contents so I'm gonna read the table of contents right now I'm gonna move on contents page let me start over contents page acknowledgments seven introduction nine production of the random digits nine tests on the random digits eleven normal deviates fourteen use of the tables twenty table of random digits one through four hundred table of random normal devious one to two hundred pagination begins anew with table acknowledgments the following persons participated in the production testing and preparation for publication of the tables of random digits and the random normal deviates Paul Armour EC Bower mrs. Pernice Braun GW Braun Walter France JJ Goodpasture WF gunning sessile or Hastings Olaf Elmer ml Jim Cosa JD Madden am mood Artie Nash JD Williams these tables were prepared in connection with analyses done for the United States Air Force okay well the introduction is gonna be you know honestly the the interesting thing is like this stuff is like the stuff in the introduction is a really fascinating interesting stuff the men I get to the random members got to get to those random numbers all right put that over there ITP winter show somebody I just this was my bookmark I didn't put it in the book somebody will remind me next time so I'm being asked in the chat Austin says don't we usually do this part at the end yes we do but I feel it's important to emphasize the random numbers book and I want to maybe as a bookend today's episode I'll do it at the beginning on the end all right let me let me take this let me look at this chat here for a second okay so I'm gonna answer a couple questions Siyad o asks how much different is p5.js from regular javascript and this is an excellent question on the one hand oh and by the way while I'm answering this question if somebody can maybe even in the slack patron group could give me a screenshot of how I had the whiteboard about Chrome extensions at the end of last week's video I'm gonna need to unfortunately okay it's off recreate that cuz the whiteboard has been erased I left it there but other people use this room so so now first of all I do have a video I think it's something like the history of p5 or during p5 and processing I have a couple videos maybe they're under the QA playlist where I talk about some of the stuff a bit more indepth perhaps but in a way I might say that comparing p5 in JavaScript is a flawed comparison so the thing to compare would be sort of more like comparing p5 and d3 or p5 and jQuery or p5 and 3j s because 3j s d3 p5 jQuery many more things these are libraries for the language that is JavaScript so javascript is the programming language p5 is simply a library of stuff that you can import and use while you're programming in JavaScript the reason why that the question is quite valid though however is because what p5 does is simply wrap or alter or provide a simpler smaller syntax for some of the things you might do in JavaScript natively meaning with just what the sort of like language provides in the browser for you by default mostly around drawing to a canvas so and it's meant to be more beginner friendly and easy to get up and running with that valuing sort of like emphasizing that over kind of longer scalable larger software projects that require a lot more strict ways of putting things together so that's that's what I would say is kind of an answer to that so Austin is also asking me to mention the Google forum so I you know I don't want to overemphasize the patreon stuff but I am finally getting around to sending rewards out for everybody who joined in 201617 I got the year it's 2017 everybody it's like the end of 2017 I've gotten everybody who joined in 2016 I think I think yes that's been that was done at the end of last year so you should have got if you're a patron you should got an email with a Google Form if you already filled out a Google Form then you didn't get an email because I have your nation already if for some reason you think that your should get something but you haven't or did get a form just send me I know right so now I have this whiteboard image and I'm going to zoom in on it and I'm gonna come over here and I'm gonna try to recreate it so I probably should have done this so what's the main thing we need for a Google Form Chrome extension I don't know I think my brain is misfiring more and more every day somebody should do unlike scientific study of the vocabularies doing over time content script last week I did some tutorials on content scripts and we had something we had a file called content j/s I also looked at background scripts and I called that background dot je s I don't like this marker let's try a different one actions browser action page action I talked about actions browser action page action actually I think I might not I'm gonna have erased that since last week because I'm gonna actually put popups down here so you know what I could do is like add over here like browser actions the browser action is like you you hit a button in the browser you can listen for that in the background script I had a little diagram a silly diagram of the browser itself which looks something like this and I think I said something like content and button like button so I think this is fine to start with so the other thing I would love for people to think about as I sort of move into looking at what a popup is and how you do a popup I would love to get some ideas for like so I want to do the same thing I did last week which is just kind of do some standard regular tutorials and that would be just how to put a popup how to communicate between a popup and a content script and we'll see if I want to do the tab over and a tab over right I definitely want to do that so I want to do those things and then what I would like to do is like come up with some very simple scenarios like I had the kitten eyes our thing I had the doodler thing so I want to do like maybe one or two Chrome extension challenges mostly when I asked for this the things people give me are like really complicated elaborate project ideas that's what I want you to make it doesn't be complicated but I want to make really simple quick projects that are kind of ridiculous and useless to help inspire you to make things from those all right so all right so I think I'm good to go with the popup thing if you wouldn't mind indulging me for a second I would love to just like look at some of my examples oops so if you're so one thing I failed to get the code from last week uploaded I'm meant to try to get this afternoon so at least could say like I upload it but I didn't get to so apologies for that I will make sure soon to have all the code from the tutorials from last week and from today uploaded on github but what I want to show you is I also have a lot of Chrome extensions first of all I have a writeup by the way if anyone wants to this this is this page this website this is where I have tutorials for one of my courses if anybody wants to give me a pull request this page to fix up anything that's their point to new examples embed my YouTube videos that I published in the appropriate place on this page I mean I'm gonna get to this at some point but I would accept the pull request it's github.com slash Schiffman slash Schiffman net you can find this is a github pages site that uses Jekyll so you have to kind of see how that works but I would love help with that what I'm looking for is where I have the stuff on messaging I have popups so this this is how I do a popup I give it an HTML page and then what I want to look at then a lot of these examples are here in my a to z course and I just wanted to see popup messaging how did I do this between popup and the content script so this searches for the end just sends a message so it's the same thing that you do in a background script but you send it from the popup great okay so I'm gonna do this alright okay any yeah so there's a good clarification thing I'm gonna read this comment also from Austin it might be worth mentioning when you make a Chrome extension the background script and the popup scripts essentially run in their own individual environments and this I didn't mention to st. in those words but this is why when I look at the Chrome extensions page and I want to debug something if I want to debug the background script I'm gonna have to go and open a console through here the separate environment and it doesn't know anything about the content page only the content page does so having an extension enabled is the equivalent of having one or two tabs console open so having a lot of extensions running can slow things down ziz a good point okay so um I'm not gonna be able to follow any suggestions that are in the YouTube chat Amir might catch one so if anybody sees something good who if you're in the if you're in the patron group and you see something you can paste it in the slack chat or you can tweet your suggestions too at the coding train I think I think I'm logged in as that so I can look at my notifications so if you have a suggestion for who this is a nice there's some nice things okay if you have a suggestion you can you can tweet it to me here and I will take a look at it alright I think maybe oh boy did I really just talk for a half an hour I think maybe we're ready to begin what's interesting to me is like I can easily imagine a live stream that happens you know every week or something that's just like a half an hour long I manage to just talk for a half an hour like how I'm about to do something so apologies for that mono deep in the chat asked do you have any nodejs tutorials I have a whole bunch of nodejs tutorials I wish there was a really perfect and great way that I could organize everything so you can find it instantly you just have to poke through my different playlists on on YouTube alright let's let's remember our sponsor on the coding tree hydrogen dioxide hmm at oxygen stuff with the hydrogen stuff I mean you got to get it mixed in a certain way precisely otherwise you could really run into trouble but it is quite good alright yeah I'm being asked will you make a tutorial about how to make a Firefox extension I would like to to be honest with you I've never done that before so I might may get more of like I don't know tutorials the right word but I'm gonna attempt to do one if we have time today dihydrogen oxide I said that wrong didn't I oh my god hold on I totally said that wrong how embarrassing and then h2o Wikipedia yeah the two is oh my god I don't even want to I don't even I don't even I don't let's let's just move off of this topic immediately oh no I was right you're talking bout something else I don't know what's going on anymore can we please move up I don't know anything about a chemistry it's chemistry right that's the correct subject do I own a clothing store I do not but I do have look cool this is live right I can't just like go back in time anymore let's let's do some popups let's let's think about kids yes kids thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that I hide all right so uh huh thank you thank you very much everybody this has been the coding train introduction I think I gotta go now many 806 will be by again hello this is another video in my series about Chrome extensions which you know right now I just want to say at the beginning of this video I hope to actually turn this playlist into something that's instead of saying Chrome extensions just say browser extensions because that is something that is quite possible beyond simply the browser chrome but I'm gonna stick with Chrome right now as I work through all the details so what am I going to add in this particular video well as you can see here in my diagram the over there anymore my monitor is now blocked by something else as you can see in my diagram here I have talked about content scripts and background scripts and what I'm going to add today is something called a popup so a popup is a page that you can launch that's essentially like an overlay of what what's in the browser at the certain and a certain moment and I can launch it via a browser action for example clicking a button that I have in the top over here I can press that button and I can have some sort of popup come up so I could do things like I could have an interface where I could change colors or make selections or or type in a word that I want to look up I can augment the browsing experience through a separate popup page that is that as part of my Chrome extension so that's what we're gonna make in this tutorial I'm now going to walk over here and then I just realized I don't have anything prepared code wise I'm so I got a this look this will be an edit point so I'm gonna go here Chrome extensions backgrounds grip let's let's stick with that one whoops ah so I'm gonna do oh five popups and one thing I want to do is just fix this button because I think this button had all this transparency associated I'm just gonna hold on this is very important work that I'm doing I'm going to crop this image it's very important that I do this okay and then I'm going to look I'm gonna I'm gonna delete these extensions and I'm going to change I'm gonna open up Adam and I'm gonna close these and I'm gonna go to pop ups a background script which I don't need just to have a pop up I don't need a background script so I'm going to take out the background script this content script just changes when I press the button I'm gonna so I'm gonna take this out I'm gonna leave this in here huh maybe I should do this in hold on I'm gonna actually do this in the tutorial cuz I'm gonna start with the one that I had last so let me put that back and here so I'm going to change the browser action to a popup okay I should really switch to visual studio yeah probably oh there's this teletype thing for Adam have you have you all seen this we should try it looks very dangerous forbids it allows everybody to only collaboratively edit the same file which I'd love to do but I have a feeling that I will get some serious trolling in if I let just like open that up to anybody so I'm not so sure how to approach that all right so I'm gonna call this coatings train extension 3 and I'm gonna hit refresh and I'm going to come back over here and alright I'm going to I can leave these things open that's fine here all right and now ok so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start with the code that I had at the end of my background script tutorial which if we look at already made a copy of it into a new folder which I'm calling popups which you can find a link to this code for the tutorial in the description as usual and what i'm what i have is that manifest.json file so i've already changed it to coding train extension 3 maybe I'll say you know I'll changes the coding train popup it is like the content script is available for all URLs in the background strip now interestingly enough I actually don't need a background script just to have a popup like I might need a background script for something else that's going on in my extension but I don't need it just for the popup so I think just for simplicity in this particular tutorial I'm gonna take out the background script and I'm actually going to just delete the file that is the background so actual you know what I'm gonna leave it there because eventually one thing that I'm gonna want to do is if you recall a way that I sent a message the way that I controlled the content script or made an event happen the contract script from the background script was sending a message and actually what I probably going to want to do now is set message from the popup to the content script so the code that's in the background script is going to become useful for me because I can use that same code in the popup alright so but when there's a browser action I want there to be something more I want there to be a default popup no it's not written over there what I'm supposed to type right here I just looked over there because there was something interesting happening I'm putting notes over there and I want this to be now can I make that in another folder let's try this and I want to try do is make the popup of entire Pete let's actually first just make an HTML page so I'm gonna just call it popup HTML and I think I need to say oh I don't need to but I can say default title and this will appear in like the tooltips like a popup will come here alright so I think that is now some stuff that I can add to now have a popup now what this means is there needs to be an HTML page called popup that HTML so I'm gonna make that file popup dot HTML and I'm just gonna I mean I should I don't really know you need all this stuff in the HTML page but let's just put basically like something really basic there right now just to say like no I know choo choo okay so this is this page I want to see popup when I press that button in the browser okay here we go so now what do I need to do remember I need to load the code and it'll load that extension oh five popups this is the one I'm gonna select the whole folder I'm gonna hit select no errors occurred in the loading of this extension so it should be fine now I can go to any page I just happen to be going to my coding train I mean my chrome extension tutorial page I'll go there now look I should be able to see this button right here this is my button the reason why it has that image is because I included the default icon to be this PNG file and if I click there look at that there's my popup it can't have a giant to chew right there and not use the train whistle all right so we see that the pop ups work now let's try to do something a little bit more interesting with the pop up let me see if I can put an animation there something let's see if I can put a whole p5 sketch there so let's try that so what I want to do I'm going to just work with the file system for a second like let me see if I can do I'm gonna make a folder called sketch and then what I'm gonna do is I'm going to I'm gonna actually delete popup dot HTML we saw that that worked I'm going to pause for a second and come back in a second and we need to find a p5 sketch so let me what's a good example p5 sketch like the flocking one for example for like no good reason other than why not right so where do I have do I have a nature of code examples on this computer examples p5 seriously do not have a nature of code examples p5 let's go get that github.com / Schiffman / the nature of code examples p5.js that is clone this repository oh the morphing circle that is a good one oh yeah I should probably do something from a code previous coding challenge so it's a better idea thank you good suggestion so where is where do I keep that let's look for the rainbow code repository I must have it somewhere on this computer oops and let me Oh in my other it's in a different that's this is gonna be a problem is it really gonna let me do this there's no way it's gonna let me do this yeah because I'm not like earth this is so ridiculous boy am I really making this I'm over doing this now just like go rainbow there's a song anyway I don't know what my computer is showing me let's that's gonna be good enough so let's go to coding challenges and let's find what's a good one from here the morphing let's try one of the games like am I having technical issues uh I should just done the flocking thing I don't know why now I got nine I get myself feeling crazy like I have to decide what is this a fractal tree in p5 yeah I mean let's try this let's just get this one okay I like the maze generator let's do that because it's I'm kind of curious that it has like all this stuff in it let's do that desktop desktop Chrome extensions popups I'm just gonna really quickly just gonna really quickly run a server just so I can make sure that example works whoa did I just name the folder I meant to name this folder sketch not to get shot yes and here we go all right all right so this does work something horrible has happened though which is that I think it kept the file extension those computers are so silly because it's still in a folder called sketch j/s Oh everything's gonna be ok everybody I'm gonna manage this I'm gonna manage this I am going to make this happen I can do it I can put everything where I want it to be I can fix things that are named in weird ways for no reason and there we go ok so now the goal is when I click the button to have the maze popup let's see if we can make that work all right so where was I this tutorial was somewhere lost all right and I'm back now what I have done in that very long amount of time wait longer than should taken me is I have grabbed one of my previous examples from a coding challenge that generates a maze and I have put all of the code for that coding challenge in a folder called sketch so now what I want is for the popup to display that example let's just look at that example what that example does I've got that example also just running here in the browser let me just quickly go to that so this is the example it it generates a maze using a particular algorithm that I used a long time ago in to challenge so what I want is when I click this the files not there anymore I want to see that maze okay here we go we're gonna make this happen so what do I do what I have to do is this file doesn't exist anymore I deleted it what I need to do is here the default popup should be sketch slash index.html so the question is is that enough if I just point to that page that's in the sketch folder will it work or do I need to do something more to reference the different JavaScript files and libraries and things that I'm using let's find out and then I'm going to change oh let me just show you that here we should see we should say generate a maze that's going to be the message the little tooltip message when you hover over the button so I need to go and reload the Chrome extension and it doesn't actually really matter what page I'm on but I'm a stick on this page if I hover over here you should see right I'm getting that generate a maze message and then I worked so that was actually quite easy so you can see here I have the maze generating in the popup and interestingly enough let me press that but goes away is it gonna pause and continue from where it was before is it gonna start over had it already been running for a while when I first clicked it I'd even notice let's look again let's see interesting it started over so notice this is very important this is a page that's being loaded fresh each time every time you click it's not a page that's running and being hidden and then revealed it's actually a new page that's being loaded which brings up another question how do i D bug something that's happening on the popup is there something here nope whoops so let's add a console dot log into the popup this is actually all of that code and I'm just going to say console dot log frame count so this is what I would log typically in a p5 sketch if I wanted to just see that it was running it should say 0 1 2 3 4 5 counting every single frame so now I'm gonna reload the extension I'm going to refresh over here and I'm going to click the button so where is it logging that well let's look in the JavaScript console let's try clicking the button again it's over my console let me try it again no so notice how this is not where the only the content script is playing a role in the actual content page this popup is just information so this video is about the end because I'm kind of at the end of it but I need to do something what I want to show is how you can have the content script send a message I'm sorry the popup send a message because ultimately maybe I want to build an interface there where I you know I made a Chrome extension where I do it along the page so maybe I can like pick a color or change the line thickness that type of thing so I'm gonna get to that in the next video but I at least want to figure out where I can debug this stuff let's go back to here Wow I expected to see it here pause look at the chat where do I where do I see the right click on the popup and you have the console for debugging oh that's what I need to do or is it even something that I could do here oh this is where I could do it whoops so this is actually where I want to do it right no inspect I guess I need a whole separate I need to get it here alright great so that's what I'm going to do so the interesting no I would have assumed oh maybe I wonder what this is here but let's put it back and where was I did I already just look I think I just looked over here but do that again just in case I didn't alright so where we've established that it's not here in the console I don't see any console dot log if I look here this is where I would have a console log for a background script but I don't have a background script this is a popup I don't see it there where is it so actually thank you to the chat who clued me in on this I'm going to press this button here and I'm going to right click and if I rightclick I now see I have this option called inspect and I can select that and it's going to bring up another window I can go over to console so this is the JavaScript console for the popup there's a JavaScript console for the page content page there's a JavaScript console for the background script and now there's a JavaScript console for this particular popup okay so I've shown you how to add a popup you can do this anything that you can put on a web page can be in a popup you could start querying api's and drawing maps and doing anything in that popup so what I want to do in the next video is show you how to send a message from the popup to the content script and change something in the interface by what you're doing in the popup and I kind of have I have an idea for that okay hold on hold on we might have some breaking news default console.log comes from content scripts for publishers alone scope yeah yeah yes okay all right so now next up almost finished with this coffee here what we're gonna do when it's all done just drink water coding that coding train popup thing looks red I'm not sure what that's referring to Simon but alright so thank you potato cool I love all these crazy names that appear in the chat so a little woozy a very big lunch today I think that's it's not good for when it starts to approach five o'clock so what I want to do I need to talk a little bit about scope so let me think what I'm gonna do here the content script in the example just changed the content of paragraph elements I mean I think an interesting code a couple coding challenges could be take my doodle example and like change the thickness of what you're drawing actually didn't publish that video I just rose I didn't publish that video yet it's there in the playlist if you want to find it but it's just not a made public yet another option would be I mean I have this idea of doing something today that's a Chrome extension for Twitter mostly like can we fix Twitter like basically just make a Chrome extension that erases everybody's tweets and you only see like nice messages to people that's an idea and maybe then they pop up you could like type in your messages oh I know what I'm going to do so what I'm gonna do is I think what this did right is it made this Chrome extension what I had before is it changes the inner H it made everything or whatever the background color but I can change the innerhtml to whatever you're typing in the popup so we're gonna do that that's gonna that's what I'm gonna do yeah the popup just by default gets the automatic document body with or whatever the page width and kind of sizes it that way at least turn the doodle thing on and off that's a great idea Simon so you know these all these ideas one of my reasons for being here is not to do all the ideas but to have other people do the ideas but that is perfect that's a great that's a great thing okay so let me move on now and go on so oops I'm definitely gonna need a short break at some point to get some more water it's because I talked about well where am I here okay okay I'm back in another video about popups what I did in the previous video is I just made something a page popup when I press the button in the Chrome extension you know what it's really bugging me I don't know what it looks like for a broadcast on YouTube but I'm getting some weird like moiré pattern thing it's driving me crazy so I just want to change the width to like 50 or maybe 40 is actually 40 is better I need to reload the extension there we go okay interestingly enough it's like kind of and then I'm going to hold I just want to like clean this up a little bit here we go that's a little bit a little bit better all right sorry all right popup this is another video I just thought of that right now oh I'm such a not genius when it comes to bad jokes on the internet and I also think like I hurt my back the other day anyway here I am in another video about popups in Chrome extension so in the previous video all I showed you how to do was if you add a browser action with a button when you click that button you can have a web page popup and in this case I have an entire p5.js sketch animating as part of the popup but why would I want to have a popup well one of the reasons why I would want to have a popup is to provide an interface for my Chrome extension that might change some settings to have some place where I could enter some information to to show something related to what's on the web page that I'm on so in order for that to actually happen I need to have some way of communicating between the content and the popup now one thing that's important about Chrome extension I haven't actually used the word scope but I think it's to mention this before when I wanted to communicate between the background script and the content script they live in different scopes each one of these things lives in its own bubble the background script the popup the background script the popup the content script all in their own separate bubble so only the content script is allowed to mess around and know about what's on the content page the popup knows nothing about that and it's not as if you could just make a global variable and use the same variable in both places their different scopes there's sort of a trick to getting variables from the background script but that's another story now so what do you I need to do is I need to have a way of sending messages back and forth in very similar to how you might do this in a networked application I have this thing running over here and this thing running over the air I'm gonna send a message over here to make this thing happen that's what he did to do the nice thing is the API the set of functions that I showed in a previous video for how to communicate from the background script to the content script I can use that same functionality to communicate from the popup to the content script so what I think I'm gonna try to do let's come back over here is first time to get rid of this maze thing it's kind of interesting but I'm gonna I'm gonna go into my p5 sketch I'm just gonna kind of delete everything and I'm gonna have some extra JavaScript that I don't need I'm gonna delete that I'm gonna delete this extra file here this does not need to be in this video and I'm so I'm gonna go to sketch J yes and I'm just gonna say function setup and function draw and I'm gonna I'm gonna say no canvas and I'm going to put some elements on the page like I don't need this anymore I don't need the sound library oh that's interesting that I could have sounds I'm gonna put some elements on the page so I'm gonna say type paragraph replacer and then I'm going to make an input element with an ID called user input I know is that how you do it do I need to close it like that or just put a slash let me in something like that I'm gonna put that in like a paragraph then what I'm gonna do oh let's see this is this this looks weird but I feel like I messed something up here but I'm just gonna leave it then what I'm going to do is I'm going to reload my extension and I'm gonna press the popup I say okay so now I have this paragraph replacer what I want to do is anything I type here I'm going to replace the content on the webpage with anything I type there just as a demonstration of how you can communicate between the two and remember I could send from the content script so one thing I might like to do for example is I actually have an example so I'll link to that from here is what if I'm on a webpage and I like select a word and then I press this I'm gonna make this as a coding challenge so I select a word on the webpage I press the button and it goes to an API like word Nick and finds me the definition for that page so we'll do that as a coding challenge in maybe that in the next video actually but in this video I'm gonna do something simple and I just need to have this messaging go back and forth so how do I do that first let me just weirdly make sure messaging works and I'm going to actually no no let's I don't need to draw loop there's no animation happening you could have an animation what I want to do is I want to say user input equals select so I'm using the p5 Dom library to grab that element and then and that says user put user input then I want to use the user input dot input there are two events that can be associated with a textbox one is the event called changed which only happens when I like press enter or tab out of that I could maybe have a submit button or something but I'm actually just gonna do it as I'm typing so the input event is an event that happens every time I press a key so I'm gonna say pressed you know user key pressed oh boy terrible name for a function I can't even tolerate it new text will call this new text so I'm gonna write a function called new text and here now I want to send a message to the content script so all I'm gonna do now to make sure this is working is send a message with what's in like this is the message user input values so whatever is in that text input box that's going to be the message so I content script actually a hole ready has code to receive a message it already has code to receive a message because that's what I had in a previous example and I actually don't need to change it I do need to think about how I'm gonna format that message my background script that I did in a previous video has the code to send a message this is how I send a message now the thing is how do I get the current tabs ID so this isn't going to work exactly let me move into here the idea that I'm gonna do here is right now I'm gonna craft the message as a JavaScript object then I'm gonna send that message to the tabs that tab that I'm currently on I could actually send it to other tabs but if I send it to the tab that I'm currently on how do I get the tab that I'm currently on look up how to do that I have it in an example I'm like where would be the document to pause for a second I'm looking I'm looking in the chat to see if someone just wants to tell me where the document oh this computer went awry let's let's see if I have any okay so oh this is not scroll that shot is not scrolling here I don't need the input call it change text these are all like much better yeah oh these are also much better suggestions all right so what I'm looking for is okay let me look at my example first but I'm rather look let me look in my example and in my example popup messaging how did I get it oh I have to query for the tab look at that I have to query for the tab all right so tabs dot query params active true current window true and then I have to query and then I get the tabs back all right all right that's interesting so let's see where would that be that would be chrome tabs API this is it so just just so I understand correctly I'm gonna correct this I don't even need this anymore like I should just do this so just like this is more correct all right I will get rid of that I will get rid of that in a little bit why is my my monitor is like lagging behind me it's kind of freaking me out it's when I do something it like happens oh this is so weird wait wait wait I'm in real time I think what are you guys seeing a delay with my typing like watch this I'm pressing a and then it appears pressing a are you guys seeing that delay or am I just seeing this delay in a preview oh I'm really getting stuck on something indentation is off I have a feeling it's off because of this or maybe this what did I miss there's a little delay it's not really bugging anybody too much right the delay I probably shouldn't worry about fixing that right now yeah I see everybody fuge delay so let me know in the if the delay is actually an issue or if it's like everything you can follow everything that I'm doing even with that delay okay I know the indentation is off but oh yeah we fix that um that's gonna make people crazy all right okay wait so query Oh get actually you could just use get I was using query in my example but maybe we can okay so okay okay so what I need to look at is the chrome tabs package I don't know if package is the right thing to say the API and that's here so extension slash tabs this is a set of functions that I can employ to sort of figure out about the tabs so one thing I can do is just probably get current is all I need that I actually in some of my examples I noticed I'm using this query to like query about all the tabs but I think all I need to do is say get current so get current just gets the current tab which is what I want so I am going to say first right to do is say chrome tabs get current and a got tab so I need another call back and not getting into this sort of like crazy nested call back stuff which I really want to try to avoid and some of the new arrow syntax and other promises stuff I'll get into that at some point kind of but I think this is fine so right the user presses a key new text and someone suggested that I call this change text which I think is better then as soon as that happens I want to say which is the tab which the current tab so I need to get the current tab once I've got the current tab it should be the actual current tab is passed into my callback as an argument so once I do that I could just send the message to that particular tab I'm going to send the message oh right I'm not actually doing anything of value yet and to send that message hello and let's see what happens so now let's go and oh and let me in the content scripts console time console logging the message so I'm actually just gonna console.log the whole message so we should see that in the content script so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to reload my extension I'm gonna go over here to this page I'm going to open up the JavaScript console and when I do this I don't see anything yet but as soon as I start typing in that paragraph I should see here the message coming through that didn't work so let's look at inspector inspect this element let's look at the console Oh tabs dot get current cannot read property idea of undefined so you might need permissions ah so thank you breaking news from the chat firs I'll Simon Thank You Simon suggested that I call it change text and I probably need to add anytime you start to use something from the chrome API I need to explicitly say in my manifest out JSON that I intend to use this so I don't know if this is if that's the problem but we're gonna have to figure this out so one thing that it could be is that I need to go to my manifest.json and add something like permissions is permissions already in here no permissions and this should be maybe an array what's an array I think and it has tabs as one of my permissions so this could be the thing that fixes it let's try it I kind of think that I might have done something else wrong but let's try some and reload this I am going to reload this open up here yes work either I really just wait to in love with my sound in fact somebody should probably I probably need an intervention about that alright so that was not the air here I'm gonna think about this a little bit let's look at the documentation do you know what's good to do read the documentation gets the tab that this script call is being made from maybe undefined if called from a non tab context for example a background page or other words just just or pop up view so that's definitely the problem and that's probably why what I actually did in one of my examples is used query so let's let's use query so let's try using query so I'm gonna change this to saying I'm gonna go back to my content scrub where am I in the where am I looking in the pop up yeah in the pop up I'm gonna change this to chrome tabs query and what I need to do if I'm gonna run query is I need to give it some parameters for the query like I need to I want it says optional but I want like all of the active tabs and I want I think it's only active or current window and current window I might not need these but I recall doing this in a previous example so but you it's up to you to read this documentation to see what tabs you want returned so I need that so now I can query for all of those tabs this is now I want to say tabs because what I'm gonna do is get an array of tabs I know that the query function probably if I look at the documentation it explains gets all the tabs that have the specified properties there might be a way for me to just get only the current tab but I'm pretty sure that tabs index zero is the tab that I want so let's try this now I think we're in good shape here I'm gonna go over here and I'm going to say reload the extension I'm gonna come over here press the popup Oh seriously how could that not have worked let's look here inspect console huh no error message so let's let's take a look at this so let's let's debug this text changed let's console.log that video is way more debugging than usual and let's console.log let's look at the tabs I'm gonna say got tabs and let's console.log it and now let's try this again to reload the extension I'm gonna not use my ridiculous sound effects anymore because I'm overdoing it I'm gonna reload the extension I'm gonna press this oh of course now it works I probably just like missed clicking save or reload or something anyway so I think it actually did work but that's how I would have debug it if it hadn't worked weirdly enough I like behind by one reload right because now I'm not seeing my messages save am I not like saving in the right it's like behind by one reload let's reload let's refresh oh oh no no no no no I need the classic error I'm looking for all of my messages here only the content script messages will be there if I want to see the popup messages they are here so that is working it's an array it's this is the information I got lots of information is an incognito tab what URL is it on what's the width you can see there's lots of information that you can get all right we're in good shape let's move a little bit more quickly here just to finish this off so what I actually want to do is I want to send what I want to send is what was it called I called it user input user input value and what I want to do in the content script is rather than change the background color I'm going to change the inner HTML I think that's what I write to message dot text and I don't I'm not going to bother to check if it's a certain map there's only one kind of message I can get so as long as I've gotten a message change whatever the paragraph text to that message okay here we go I'm feeling good about this I think this is going to work and I'm going to reload the extension I'm going to refresh this page it's got some paragraphs on it I'm gonna feel confident enough to actually close the JavaScript console I'm going to open this up and now here we go oh it's the wars I really shouldn't have done that all right I shouldn't have closed anything let's try this again let's look it let's look here console Oh syntax error in my code ah the worst I'm the worst sketch line 21 Oh would I put this stomach on there probably all of you noticed this and you've bound to watch like an extra two minutes of this video it could edit out this mistake but probably gonna leave it in let's try this one more time reload extension and open oh no and now press this and now I'm going to type into the paragraph release inspect console ah okay so it's that's working all right let's see what's going on here in the content script console dot log message didn't get the message sketch Jas might see I think we're gonna have to do some editing on this one is too many I should be one line below yeah the semicolon should go here but Oh is there something weird with the sound effects those messages maybe they're not P elements no all right hold on Oh dot style this dot style is not relevant I had that south and I was changing the background color innerhtml is not a part of the style it's just part of the element itself so I think it's gonna work this time I've corrected this everything's good here in terms of my syntax let's try this one more time okay here we go I am now going to reload the extension refresh the page press this button and start typing yeah look whatever I type into here now goes into every single paragraph elements on the page this worked exclamation point thank you thank you very much so this has been the end of this sending a message from a popup to the page and I'm gonna do a coding challenge which you'll find at some point when I publish it where I'm going to actually take content from the page and display information while querying an API information about it there so I'm gonna do that in a coding challenge soon thanks for watching oh my god I it's already 520 now here's the thing this is actually really driving me crazy this delay I just want to see if I unplug and plug back in if it fixes it so I'm unplugging no so that delay is happening somewhere else I probably have to restart the computer which I'm not going to do because it'll cause the stream to end so hopefully everything is just fine whoo yes that's right since I did innerhtml instead a text content I can actually type stuff in there all right boy I'm exhausted just a long week all right so let me think I like the idea of doing this coding challenge so let me look at my list here so I did the least I did these two things I could do quickly the tab override it's like the simplest thing in the world I might as well make a video for that I don't actually even yeah inner HTML is but yeah security nightmare but you know whatever maybe I should a little addendum there I don't know if I should need to do an addendum but tab override let me look at that I feel like that's the easiest thing in the world to do Chrome extension override yeah this is like the easiest thing in the world to do you just change you just use the chrome URL override what's let's do that cuz that's gonna be like a short simple quick video and that might need a short break and then I'm gonna do a couple coding challenges and just see what I'll see what else I can manage today all right can I remember this chrome underscore URL overrides you tab I really need this break it's gonna make me P so we gonna make this one this tutorial go quickly I think I also might have had too much caffeine which was really a problem for me alright so let me get I'm gonna get that in a way what I kind of want to do is actually use the word Nick API and just get like the word of the day or something but let me just you know what I'm just going to show how to do this I can use the let me do this simple content script one post six tab override I'm just trying to think like what could I put as the content yeah thank you developer.chrome.com/apps ketch and it'll just do something silly like count oh you can replace any of these other things new tab bookmarks history fascinating fascinating yeah so here it is alright history new tab greatgreatgreatgreatgreat quick quick review all right wonderful and let's get rid of this one and let's go to tab override and and we'll leave all this here okay this Blake oh yes great idea kitten override that's a great idea I love that idea so let me get a let me just get like the sketch here so it's there and I never fixed that people are gonna go crazy kittens then let me get the kitten images and I'm just going to call this like one two three four five okay so I'm setting this up and here we go all right this this is really things my green thing here I guess I have to lower this a little bit like the keying is a little bit problematic today but hopefully it's fine you know what this needs to be maybe if this turns over a little bit points a little bit down it's not better okay I've got one more probably more than that but at least one more thing to show you about Chrome extensions I'm gonna show you about overrides what is an override so first of all if you use the Chrome browser and you ever hit command T or new tab you get this default page which has a Google search and like shows you some recent web pages that you've been to this is something you can override you can create your own web page that appears for a new tab and there are lots of examples of Chrome extensions that you can get that show you pretty nice things and daily affirmations and stuff like that you can also override the history page and well something else where do you find out information about this it's I'll include a link to this in this video's description this is the documentation for override pages so you can override the bookmark page the history page in the new tab page I'm going to override just the new tab page and the way that we do this is by adding this code here to the manifest JSON so I'm gonna copy this and I'm gonna go to the manifest JSON for a new Chrome extension I'm gonna get rid of the content script I just copied one of my previous ones I could get I don't need a content script as part of this and actually it wouldn't make sense to have a new tab override that also had a Content script I don't think so and I want to override new tab and what I want to do is point to my HTML page and I happen to have associated with this project this is my example number 6 a folder called sketch and it this is a p5 sketch and as an index on HTML page so what I want to say is sketch slash index at HTML I am going to just say function setup create canvas 200 200 you know background zero and I'm gonna say I'm gonna add something here like h1 hears a kitten cuz people make a new so I'm gonna add some stuff to the HTML and to the JavaScript just to see that this works now what I'm gonna do is go to my extensions page I am going to load the extension I want to load my example number 6 ah right I got an error what is my error looks like I have an extra comma here and it's telling me that I don't have valid JSON so I should be able to go back to my manifest.json get rid of that comma hit save try to then say a retry that worked and now I should open a new page yep so every time I open a new tab I get that webpage so let's make it do something a little more interesting let's say let's let's actually not have a canvas you obviously have an animation we say no canvas I'm gonna say R equals a random number between 1 and 6 because I actually want you know I'm gonna say between 0 and 1 2 3 4 5 0 and 5 I have what I have is and then I'm gonna say a create image kittens slash R plus dot jpg so what you might notice is that I have a folder called kittens with five images of kittens all named one through five so I probably should have started naming him with zero but I could just add one to it so I want to create a Dom element which is a kitten image and show it on the page so I'm gonna do that and I'm going to and we might have an issue I mean I'm just waiting to see what happens I'm going to reload the extension I'm gonna make a new tab up whoa that is and it worked well now here's the thing I should probably size it and I'm just gonna say image size window with window height image dot position zero zero so I mean this is some silly I should probably be more thoughtful about CSS and all that but I'm just going to use some p5 code to size the image to the page and maybe I'll get rid of the here's a kitten's message now I'm going to reload again and now make a new tab every time I make a new tab I get a different kitten yay so this is how you do a override so now the world is your kitten oyster think of what you might make something that checks for today's weather if you want to make something practical something that shows something beautiful something that reminds you of an important message anything that you could think of you can make anything you can make a webpage you can make as the new tab override thanks for watching subscribe like I'm supposed to say at the end the video this was a short one so maybe might actually hear it well everyone's telling me about how horrible my CSS skills are which is absolutely true I'm really losing steam here 530 yeah document.body dot style dot background equals URL kitten dot jpg yes but the point of what I'm showing is not the efficient way to make the kitten in the background I'm just showing you gonna have a p5 sketch so or any webpage and you drink some water I'm gonna take a short break I'm gonna play the dis song I'm gonna play the Vista song I'm going to mute my microphone and I'm gonna leave you with kittens this kitten I guess I'm going to take a short break and I'm going to come back let's look at our let me let me sort of figure out what I want to do for in the next half an hour that I have so I got through these three things so things that I could do are the coding challenge that looks up something onward Nick which I think would be interesting I'm gonna skip the omnibox thing definitely least today I should look investigate like how to make a Firefox extension I'm really not prepared to do that but I can at least maybe look at that a little bit WebGL let's see alright so let me take a break here actually let's do let me let me at least put up a little strawpoll thing see what people are interested in so options word by the way the word lookup Chrome extension involves a back we'll need a background script and a content script and a popup which I haven't done at all so that's kind of interesting word Nick like lookup extension WebGL revisited what else do I have on this list that I could do that's kind of those are my two things I would like to do and maybe I just yeah and then I'm just gonna whatever I'm just curious this is now absolutely that I'm doing this straw polls I think I'm just gonna try to do both of these but if I only had time for one which would you prefer I kind of want to be done with the Chrome extensions no strawpoll everybody I feel like if I do that last Chrome extension coding challenge I can be done with Chrome extensions I can talk about generic browser extensions for Firefox and even try to make one and then that might actually be it for today yeah connection to any API and a Papa but that's super interesting it's gonna open up a lot of ideas so I'm gonna mute my microphone you won't hear from me I'm gonna put on some music see if I can pee I always forget forget this I'm gonna do this this dot this dot this star this start song never forget the Vista but somebody composed that song for me alright I'm back I realized what I should do is play I forgot that I can play my crazy trailer thing which is this thing which guys can hear you talking over a while while you take a break but I'm not gonna play this right now you can go and find that video on the home page of my channel o persistent data with local storage such a good idea I'm sorry everybody I'm not gonna get much let me add that can I I'm logged in as myself that's good so I'm obviously not I don't think I'm gonna get that today but I do think that would be worth so I'm going to do API lookup and persistent data with local storage I actually so I would like to do that I wanted to be done with Chrome extensions but that would be worth looking at some time so let's commit these changes alright everybody so what I need to do now is I need to give myself kind of like a basic template I'm gonna use the popup Swan oops copy can I just do like this or something yeah there we go oh seven I need something to perk me up here I know what it okay oh no not this one okay we are now doing word Nick so I need to be prepared so coding train so I can leave all this actually because I'm going to revise it in the tutorial there's this there's that but what and then there's sketch so boy I'm gonna have to look up how to receive the message it's fine I'm gonna but I do need my API key so where can I get that if I go to API is data word Nick word info hopefully my API key is still valid all right okay Oh weird nick has a public key that's good to know I don't mind using mine now I can always change it or regenerate it or something drink a little while I'm sorry but usually I simply won't have energy good thing I have to leave around 6 because I'm really running out of energy but let's let's definitely at least make this this is gonna take longer than 20 minutes but because I have there's a lot of stuff I'm gonna have to look up as I don't know any of this off the top of my head but let's go close all this and this all right here we go welcome to a coding challenge in this coding challenge I am going to attempt to make a Chrome extension where you can let me start over again it's a good web page to be on for this let's just go to Wikipedia how about a steam train steam locomotive okay all right hello welcome to a coding challenge in this coding challenge I am going to attempt to make a Chrome extension that allows you to highlight any word and then press a button up in the corner of the browser and it will open up a popup and show you the definition of that word so I need a lot of pieces to this here if I come back to my if I come back to my diagram here of all the pieces of the Chrome extension and I can't look at a diagram without marker what I need I certainly do I even need a Content script I just realized that I don't think I need a content script for this amazingly high the idea I wanted to have come up with an idea where I needed all three of these but I'm realizing that I think that background scripts can determine what it is you've highlighted on the page because that's kind of a browser action it's not really a part of the page that's kind of something you're doing with the browser itself you're highlighting some word and then I need the background script to send a message to the popup you know I guess I could affect the content script so this will be an exercise for you I'm gonna put the results in the popup but you could do something when you highlight a page you actually just create a little like div overlay wherever that word is or something that shows the definition but I'm gonna put that information in a popup and the popup is going to go in query an API like word Nick and look for the definition of that word okay did you guys hear that because I just sometimes some days some days Google dictionary and that's the one I use okay all right so I'm not gonna code from nothing here because I'm really tired a lot of time so I'm gonna use the code that I had at the end of my popups tutorial which is a witch which I'll link to in this video's description so actually what I would I I don't need it I'm gonna remove the content script I do need to add a background script I think I do this how do I do that I think is it just the name of the background script I'll have to look that up and I want to call this I want to call this word Nik look up okay let me double check one of my old examples look that's not that one hold on give me a second here okay I can do this everybody yes I can I'm gonna go back and look at one of my background script examples and oh this is what it looks like I just blanked I don't have this stuff memorized so to add a background script it needs to look like this so I now have a background yes and I have a browser action that look up a word and it's going to go to this particular sketch so first let me actually just see if what I can make happen is I can just if I select a word and I press the popup I see that word in the popup I just want to make sure that that happens so let me try that alright so what I'm going to do is okay in the background script I think what I need is an event for when I highlight a word and actually I pretty sure this event is like I can actually just use use the mouse up event so what I need to look for is Chrome extension mouse up event so it's really window dot mouse up what I think this is going to work for me is it just a regular event listener hold on time out I don't like that I'm doing this coding job before get event listeners oh it's not the right place look at this actually look at this here's a Google Group with actually asking this question probably capture selected text when the extension button is clicked it was exactly what I'm trying to do this is way too much how interesting I guess I could do this in the content script oh oh maybe I need to do this in the content timeout everybody I'm sorry I'm gonna look at my example this is the Don the worst I really don't know this stuff they should prepare for this I made this example like two years ago I'm just gonna look at it so this is the one that I think I do the word Nick thing and I do have a background script and a Content script because actually I should just start over ah of course I need to mouse up on the content page then I send that to the background script because I cannot send a message from the from the content script to the popup I can't send the message to the popup because the popup might not be open so I send it to the background script and then the background script receives that message and puts in a global variable this was the trick that I was going to show and receives it and then and I think I should just start over I'm just start this tutorial and then in the the popup whoops it actually there's a way to get yeah chromedout extension not get background page dot word okay alright everybody mmhmm we're gonna start over we're just gonna do this again it's gonna be awesome so I do need a background script do you need a content script and okay right everybody document I get selection in windowed I get selection both exist alright anybody who's in the slack channel who wants to feed me lines of code to enter I usually I'm like I'm like now I just give it up it's like it's like anybody can help me out here gonna make this happen okay what I prefer about Firefox over chrome is history management features in um interesting discussions going on here alright do we go welcome its promote a challenge where I really need just I don't know when you're watching this in the future in the past on a spaceship on your phone but I need I need I need some good vibes right now I'm gonna try to make this is gonna be a hard one for me I'm gonna make a Chrome extension that allows you to on any webpage like this steam locomotive Wikipedia page select some text and look up the look up the definition of a word that you've selected I'm gonna use the word Nick API and I'm gonna have the definition appear in a popup now we could make some case that this is not like the most thoughtful and elegant user interaction and so my challenge for you after I do this is there's probably a nicer way to do this like it's select should you actually just have the definition popup right there what's what's it what's a more elegant user interaction I can't even think of it but I'm actually the reason why I want to do this is because this particular idea requires all the pieces that I've shown you in my tutorials and requires a Content script a Content script it knows about the page is going to be a listen for the event of me selecting some text it requires a popup because I say so because I want to show the definition in the popup so in theory all that it requires is the content script and the popup because why not just send a message from the content script of the popup the problem is I can't guarantee that the popup is open if I probably couldn't open the popup automatically so I'm not going to open the popup automatically that's a code child see you if that's even possible I'm gonna select the text I'm gonna send the selected text to the background script by the way I was talking about this earlier that's why this whiteboard already has some notes about this then the background script is going to hold on to that selected text the popup is gonna get it from the background script it's going to go out to word Nick and it's going to show the results all right I can do it I could do it I'm gonna do it all right so let's let's work on this I'm gonna open up my chat that's going here just in case anybody can help me out the first thing I might need from the chat is how I get the selected text in the content script but actually before I even get to that let me look at what's going on here so I need a Content script I've got that permissions tabs and that actually might be unnecessary so let's just take that out right now I don't think I'm using that I need a browser action which is going to look up a definition so I'm gonna put that as the little message definition definition and then I need a background script this right background is is it script is it scripts something is definitely wrong here ooh boy no no not an array an object right oh let's just look at one of my previous ones background scripts oh boy I had a way wrong I was way wrong okay so adding a background script I need background which has scripts and then an array of JavaScript files that are part of the background script okay so now I have a background script a and by the way the code base that I'm starting with is from the end of my popups tutorial so I'll link to that video in this description so if you actually want to like what's up what's the code that I started with you can watch that video and wherever I ended that's this code okay but there's very little in it I I'm the the web page the popup has nothing in it just it I'm using the p5 library so just set up in know canvas and the background script it actually has some code in it from a while ago which i think is I'm gonna get rid of cuz that's no longer relevant I'm going to leave the but yeah okay so here we go and the content script has some other code as actually that I as well so I'm gonna actually get rid of all this it's very terrible idea so first let me at least get the selected text in the content script okay so I think I want to say like document dot event what is it what is it somebody told me document get selection a mouse up I wanna i want the mouse up event in the content script this would be an edit point no you guys didn't listen to my instructions and feed me the code that i eat at the time that i need it good thing the camera went off now anyway what's the event the mouse up event they can't remember this stuff especially not today is my brain is melted yeah alessandro is saying in the chat i believe i believe a better way of doing this would be when you open the popup send a message to the content script asking for the selected word which will answer back to the popup in the select word yeah that's actually so i'm gonna mention that ok window on mouse up okay all right so okay alright so by the way in the chat i'm being told a better way of doing this would be when you open the popup send a message to the content script asking for the selected word and then send that back so that's actually true I'm gonna still do this in a ridiculous way because I want to show you some other pieces of how you can have the background on the popup talk to each other but that is a better way to do it you should fix my code after I'm done so the first thing that I need is window dot add event listener this is a way for me to listen for the by the way I'm looking at the chat here as people are giving me some of this code of your mouse up and then I need a callback which I could write in a fancy way but I'm just going to say I'm gonna say moused UPS function worst name ever function so now if that event happens what I want to do is get the selection so I want to say the selected text is window dot I think it's just got to get selection let me just console.log that so what this should do is get this little all I should see is a console log of what's been selected yeah and I like this we're word selected it's gonna be a problem if you select more than a word but less that was a that was a good name Thank You Simon all right window decade selection okay so now oh I've got to load my extension look at my extension we're Nick it's called Wernick it's working I mean it's there I'm gonna go to this page I'm gonna open up the console and I'm gonna listen for this that event is not happening let's see here refresh the page chrome extension go so that is happening so what did I miss here window add eventlistener mouse up well let's just see if this has even happen oh wait okay hold on the Queen note get selection must be wrong let's see if at least if like were let me just console.log word select I'm sure window that get selection is totally wrong so let me reload the extension yeah oh and I'm having a weird thing where I'm either not reloading or refreshing properly because I'm getting more stuff happens so words selected and then it's actually selected text so selected text is an object selection and what I want is the actual anchor node there's got to be a way node value through a there's got to be a way for me to just get it without having this giant object but whole text text content is probably what I want so select should select a text anchor text whole content let's try that or maybe I want just text content all right let's see that was that something text content yeah so let's see if I let's see if this is right now let me just be really careful you're safe safe safe then I'm gonna go here and do a refresh and by the way let me rename the extension so I know what's going on it's the extension to be called word lookup okay I haven't looked at you in a while but really focused on my screen apologies hi thank you for watching this so let me reload the extension change the name okay now I'm gonna come back to here clear this refresh this page I'm going to find a word to select okay undefined it word selected so I clearly didn't look through that object carefully enough I'm gonna pause here for a second nobody's where's all the people correcting me words selected alright so I have to go back it's so sad hold on what I can do is know why all of a sudden today like the screen dimensions seemed totally wrong for me this we're gonna have to do some heavy editing on this let me go back I think just having one error and then fixing it I obviously typed in the wrong thing here so I'll debug this but we're good I'm gonna get the correct all right let me look at this again selection dot anchor node is there another place anchor node dot whoa that's whole text I don't want that I'm sure there's an easier way to do this just due to string no interesting does it actually work is that what I did to three yes that's what I did so you can see here that the selection is this whole elaborate object thing and I I just spend some time which you might have watched or I'm I'm not sure um be trying to like find the text in there but I thank you I just realized thank you to Alka in the chat that I can actually just say to string and what that's gonna do it's gonna take the selected text instead of giving me the full object about the selection it's just going to give me the actual text and put it right there and so so let's now let's go back reload this extension refresh the page select and there we go and were middle right you could see that I'm getting stuff selected wonderful okay now what I need to do is once I've selected something I want to send this information to the background page okay so first thing first okay so first thing let's get rid of this console log and let me first check if selected text dot length is greater than zero so if you know I could have a mouse up where there's no actual selected text so I want to make sure there's at least something there and then I need to send a message I'm looking for my notes about all the different ways to do things in a Content script if I want to send a message all I need to do I think I could just do because I don't need to send to a tab I want to send to the background script again probably use chrome runtime at it point as I look this up should really just have this I know what why am I doing this I should just put this on the computer over here I'm being silly I'm looking at the chat and all I need to do is do what everybody always says that I do that I don't do but I'm actually gonna do it now which is just put the code that I need over here because this is not working with me there's just I my brain is not coming up with this stuff off the phone the fly yeah it's so much simpler than I think it's just the runtime send message okay okay so all I need I was right I'm right I think I just need to say chrome runtime send message this is a generic way and this runtime lower case let me look guys note somewhere in lower case yeah so this is a generic way to just send a message and it's going to go to the background script and I can make the message an object and I could say the text is selected text so I want to send that message so now what I'm doing is whenever I select a word send that message to the background script okay we're sending a message to the background script so now I need to write some code in the background script to receive the message and I have that somewhere I'm pretty sure actually this is the easy part because I can use chrome runtime dot on message add listener receiver so I'm going to write a function called receiver which is going to so I now want the background script to just listen for messages so I need to add a listener and that function receiver it takes a bunch of arguments like the request the sender and the send response because if you want to send something back but all I really need to do is look at what's in the request so I think I'm just gonna say console dot log request I just want to see what's in there that's where the message should come in okay save everything save everything close a bunch of scripts save everything save everything go to extensions reload click here oh content script has a syntax error line 10 I always do this I really have a problem with a JavaScript object notation there's no semicolon here I should probably put a semicolon there okay I'm gonna hit refresh and oh wait I have to reload boy how much are you just watching me reload and refresh refresh okay so now I'm gonna click this I see the word majority now the question is if I inspect the background page there it is came in text majority yes so I have now the the message from the content script to the background script okay so now in the background script what I'm actually gonna do is just I'm gonna do something really kind of terrible I'm gonna say let word equal and I'm just give it an empty string I'm gonna say word equals request dot what did I call it text so I'm actually just gonna store the result in a global variable there may be some reason why I don't want to do this but here's why I'm doing this because and actually let's just put something I just want to put something in here here I'm just gonna put coding train on the start word because there is a way that I can access variables from a background script from the popup without actually sending a message so in other words and in other words what I can do so of course what I could do is when I open the popup again it would make more sense for an open the popup to send a message to say the background script asking for the answer or more directly I could just send a message from the pop into content script so all this background syrup is kind of unnecessary but it is a useful trick just to see that I can do this in the content script what I can do hold on here just looking at something it's gonna be an edit point yeah in the content script what I can actually do I'm sorry you know in the popup in the popup what I can actually do is I can say let word equal chrome dot extension dot get background page so if I say let me actually just say let back wrap BG page so I can actually access the background page and then the word is BG page dot word I think I could just go and access a variable that's within the background pages scope so something that I've emphasized is that the content script the background script the popup they all live with our own scope but I can access the background scripts scope and pull variables out so let me do that and I'm all I going to do is say create P word so let's see if I've made a mistake here let's see if this is working and I'm going to close this I'm going to whoop s reload this I'm going to refresh this page and I'm just going to click the button whoa undefined so I did something wrong so first of all I forgot that I had some stray code in the index of HTML so I'm gonna say call this word Nick lookup get rid of this so what did I get wrong here chrome extension get back you know I wonder I wonder if let using let is a problem because I wonder if I'm making use of sort of like goofy thing you just let me just make sure this really didn't work because I'm having a problem making sure i refresh yeah it's still saying undefined there so let me just change that to in the background script let me change is the bar let me change this devar let me reload you refresh and do this yeah look at that oh boy I don't like what's going on here I'm gonna look at the slack channel here somebody tell me if what I'm doing is to string dot trim I just need to trim I should also trim the text okay window dot word Thank You Alka all right the problem is here because I'm using Lent which is a wonderful thing let is a wonderful thing but let is locally scoped in a much stronger way than the old var thing with this I don't want to get into that now I've got a whole video about let and var but what I want to do if I really want to make this global Global global which is probably a bad idea I can say window dot word so if I say window dot word and I guess I need to do that here to window dot word I can put something in a more global scope attached to the window object of the background page there's actually this like secret background page the weird thing you don't see it but it's actually a page and so now what I should be able to do is once again reload the page refresh the page I might not need to actually briefer I'm gonna select locomotives I'm gonna do this and then look at that locomotives is there so all I need to do is query word Nick now we're in good shape now I now have what do I have I have a Content script that listens to me selecting some text it sends a message to the background script the background script stores it in a global variable for itself and the popup asks the background script for its variable again not a really sort of awkward in elegant way of doing this but to show all these pieces so coming back over here okay one thing I could have said var word by the way but the reason why I'm saying window dot word and actually I wonder once I do that I can probably just do this right I'm saying we know that word cuz I want to avoid using var that's which is sort of silly okay a couple things one is I should trim the text because it can sometimes end up having like whitespace and stuff in it so I'm gonna call dot trim which will get rid of any extra like weird whitespace stuff and now what I need to do is look up the stuff on word Nick so this is a little bit out of this so let's go to the word Nick so I'm gonna go to the word Nick API and I'm gonna go to the documentation what I want is the definition of a word so if I look up a word I can ask for its definitions and let's say I'm looking up the word Apple and I just want one definition I don't care about part of speech include related I don't need include related and I'll take all the sources whatever so I'm gonna try it out so this is the call this is the request URL that I need and then the definition is in an array oh boy Italy the definition is in an array and it comes under text ok so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna grab this request URL and what I can do in the sketch here I can say let URL equal you know see other people talking in the hallway and actually all I need to do is what I need is I'm gonna split this into two because what I want what happened here oh I need what I need is to put the word in between so this is a kind of awkward way of doing this but I need to form this big URL and actually I should use I should use this es6 thing that's new let me show you this in this video because it would be really useful here I think I could say backtick right someone's gonna help me I'm gonna need some help with this so I'm gonna cuz I'm gonna use I think if I say backtick I'm gonna get rid of all these quotes then there's a way I can actually break it up over multiple lines and just do back tic again right mmm hold on someone's gonna tell me how to do this back tick thing oh yeah and then dollar sign word okay but I seem to have the back tics wrong okay I can use back so something is wrong whoops something is wrong here in that oh I have this here shouldn't be here I thought I could do it over multiple lines let me see if I'm still oh I have too many back tics can I do it over multiple lines I know that's I'm just trying to do it over multiple lines which I guess is silly let me just let me go back yes backtick takes multiple lines all right so let's gonna let's try this is this now this is not something is wrong with this syntax anyway I'll let you are l equals this right what's going on here why is the syntax highlighting so weird oh it's highlighting URL okay thank you okay all right I'm gonna attempt to use a new feature that's part of JavaScript es6 which allows me to form a string by embedding the variable inside the string and instead of using single quotes so I'm going to get rid of all of the single quotes and everything's gonna look like a disaster right now get rid of all these single quotes and then I'm gonna use back tick back tick back tick so this should be this is now correct it's a little bit weird leaf syntax highlighted because so just to emphasize that I'm how this is working this is kind of useful I could actually write it like this like I can really see all this stuff so this is really useful to be able to break a URL break a string over multiple lines and what I want to come right after here is that's where I had the word Apple so I can now say I think it's dollar sign bracket curly brackets word so dollar sign curly brackets word this is now like fill in the value of this variable as part of this URL so I should be able to say load JSON that URL then I kind of a callback like got data I can write that function got data one of these days I'll start using the arrow syntax and stuff for an anonymous functions for the callbacks but got data data and then now I just want to say create p data index 0 so if we remember what was here it's data it's an array index 0 dot text so I just wanna get the first definition because I'm only getting one data index 0 dot text so this should be it right now my speak five sketch grabs the word from the background page forms this long URL to request stuff from word neck look uses the p5 load JSON to grab the data and show the salt okay here we go here we go there's got to be something wrong here but so first reload the page refresh this page I'm even gonna get find a word to highlight like number didn't work alright so let's look let's see where things went wrong ah server responded with the status of 404 so what is wrong here let's look at this URL I probably made a mistake in the URL one way for me to do that is just to put it here in atom so let's see HTTP oh look at this I got some weird oh there's an extra semicolon in there that's bad there's also extra spaces how come my trim didn't get rid of the spaces so let's so one thing here is a couple things I need to fix for sure let's go back to my code I had this semicolon the error was just totally unnecessary which is totally messed everything up and let's just trim it here also hi I thought I trimmed it over there but I'm gonna trim it uh it adds new line at the end of the string hmm hmm does it add the new lines or the new lines in there I kind of feel like it's okay I'm gonna I don't think the new lines are gonna be a problem okay oh I might need to replace all right so I'm being told breaking news I'm being told let's just put this in here to be safe replace any new lines with nothing so I'm just putting this on multiple lines just so I can make it more readable but obviously it can be on one line but just in case those new lines are going into the URL and messing it up let's do that all right let's reload the page refresh here I am going to select Railways gonna click here okay look that didn't work but let's see what happens now console the server is well there's like another semicolon look at this there's another semicolon right unauthorized because I stuck a silly extra semicolon so many semicolons oh that didn't work so let's get rid of these spaces that I don't know why they're in there I might have to do my own trim API word Nick page cannot be found is it HTTP so why is this not working oh there's other weird Oh the spaces are because of the new they're not from the trim they're from the new line that's all these spaces are being added these are spaces I'm really losing so let's actually make this a regular expression this is so weird you know what I'm gonna do so I can fix this but I probably just put it all in one line hope you so much better what if this is such a coding trainwreck but what I'm gonna do is I'll make a regular expression that takes any new line or any any white spaces new line of whitespace any whitespace any amount of white space and replaces it with nothing let's try this reload refresh select number inspector that's all semicolon is still there Oh cuz I didn't get rid of the semicolon ah all right one word try well I'm gonna try come on everybody this is gonna work I don't know what to play I'd have nothing to play I'm feeling good about this a little dizzy all of a sudden okay all right reload the extension are you with me refresh the page select number boy I'm really bad at debugging this I really should probably probably got to be much more careful yeah oh there's still some white space so why is the white space still in there alright cuz the new line can I do this so get the chat oh I need the global I need the global flag I need to go thank you breaking news I'm being told that I've forgotten that regular expressions when you use the replace function they only replace the first thing you find and let's use the global flag so I'm gonna go back to white space any white space replace it and and if this doesn't work I'm putting it all in one line okay you can't stop me I'm gonna put it all it wasn't here we go here we go everybody here we go here we go and go back and I'm gonna go reload I'm gonna go to the steam locomotive page and I'm gonna select locomotive I press this button a selfpropelled vehicle usually electric or dieselpowered for pulling or pushing Freight or passenger cars on railroad tracks so now I can go over here and I can open up the and I can see here for early and one thing I would like to do is I would just like to say dot style font size 64 now I wonder if all I'm doing is changing the popup so I have to reload the whole I probably reload the whole extension right 64 point let's make it like 48 point is it text size or font size I just want it to be bigger I just I just wanted to be I assume yeah look at that so interesting enough if I'm just changing the code in the popup I don't need to I don't need to actually need to reload the whole extension because it's kind of loading that on the fly which is weird how that works and also this is not real how do I make the size bigger of the actual popup that's probably I'm too tired to do that somebody will write it in the comments timeout timeout I'm gonna go away first I gotta come back how do I make the popup bigger please add text if heading also can you leave popup open until manually closed the information about Newcastle's incorrect like can I just do something like body like what determines the oh because oh I know the pay okay that's so I'm pretty sure that if I want that popup to be bigger to give me more space it's actually going to dynamically size it based on what it is when the page first loads but because I'm getting the data from Wernick later um it's not resizing so I could probably say body and then do something like with window resize by oh I could do window resize I so like I don't know if you guys would know who knows CSS would know this stuff better like can I do something like this and this has to be in a style tag according to my research according to my excellent research I don't need to reload the extension refresh the page yes oh look at that there we go so now I can click on locomotive and I get that I can click on America and I get United States I can click on obtain now again this is like the worst most Awkward interaction somehow if you're still watching this video first of all thank you they really appreciate it this has been a big struggle for me even though I made an example like this two years ago this is quite hard to do on the fly live even though you're seeing kind of an edited version of this I did do this live but I would like you to think about what is a more elegant interaction how might you want to augment someone's browsing experience to learn about additional context so this could actually be a practical tool or you could just do something kind of goofy and when you select a word you know it shows you it maybe shows you an image associating so I look forward to I will share some Chrome extensions next time I come back on a live stream of people who have like made more elegant interactions so please write your send me a link to your Chrome extension in the comments or tweet me at Schiffman something like that but this is certainly the end of this video thank you and good night fade out okay so I at 630 I think I'm done I put a fork I did not get two things that I wanted to do let's look at our list let's look at my list but I did persevere and get through kind of in a way everything I wanted to do about Chrome extensions I would love to do a Chrome extension that like just modifies people's tweets and as some so something nice to you but I'm not gonna do that right now so I uh brow okay I am NOT leaving I would it be here for a little bit longer against my better judgment I'm gonna do Firefox so first of all do I even have Firefox on this computer I have no idea how to do this no no don't import anything no don't make it the default so just looking at this am I like you know way out of date am I in a way out of date version or anything my firefox is out of date update Firefox about Firefox wait hold on about fire will open firefighters begin checking for updates and downloading them automatically Oh should be updating it right you should doing it what's the quantum thing should I try that quantum thing isn't there like a quantum quantum let's get quantum I mean quantum leap maybe Scott Bakula will show up fifty seven what house really ha I have 57 replace Oh No Schiffman browser extension this video I think we should do this with no editing doesn't matter how long takes me how much how much I need from the chat if I do this I think I can be done with Chrome extensions I could always come back to it but all right hello I'm very excited to do this video for you it's a little bit scary because I'm going to attempt to do something this video that I have no idea how to do and I've never looked at it before but I did receive this tweet from Nicholas who writes hey Daniel could you say browser or web extension most of the major browsers have the same set of api's so making a cross browser extension is easily doable see this link so it is true that this idea of ending a Chrome extension is not something limited to the Chrome browser and I've been saying Chrome extension all this time because it's what I was familiar what I'm familiar with and what I've used before but this idea of an extension is can be thought of in a larger broader way as a browser extension there is a uniform standard API from the Mozilla Foundation we can look at it here for a browser extensions so could I possibly in this video take one of my extensions I made like the kitten one and just make it work in Firefox as a browser extension this is what I'm going to attempt to do and I hope that people you you might be watching this as a Reddit 'add version but this is happening live and I'm really relying on the chat there's a YouTube chat and there's a slack channel going on here and I'm gonna follow and watch okay so what do i do first anybody have evidence so your first extension let's look at that I think I could skipped what are extensions oh oh so I need a manifest.json hey look at this it looks like I've done so actually I have a feeling I don't know if the chicken or the egg came first but I do know that I like I like a vegetarian omelet it's quite delicious now I can't be vegan obviously because eggs aren't but anyway I just I like vegetables that's am I really talking about that now no but this looks like so much so let me just go get my let's what is it possible that I could just run by extension in Firefox I don't actually recode it at all so let's go to all the these are all the extensions that I made with the exception of the first was a bookmark content script background script to kittens one the sketch one the pop ups let's try the kittens one i'm let's try the kids one so i'm gonna just make it a new folder whoops i'm gonna copy it and i'm gonna call it 008 browser kittens just i want to kids have to change some aspects of it let's leave that so it's just a content script with a kittens a folder of kittens and a manifesto JSON alright so let's see here how do I load an extension extensions Firefox colon extensions that doesn't work addons for Firefox where do I go so these are extensions I can get how do I add a developer one somebody I'm waiting for something that's fat to tell me cross browser kittens everybody should make cross browser cute wonderful kids I'm looking I'm waiting all right I'm gonna look myself unpacked extension firefox open firefox enter about debugging in the URL bar click load temporary addon so that seems like what I have to do about debugging yeah there we go enable addon debugging sure load temporary addon kittens where to kittens where the kids desktop extensions browser kittens open open no no do I just select a manifesto JSON file alright yeah it's there the KO it says chrome that's the worst so let me at least fix that let me go to the manifesto JSON and say browser this is now a browser X kitchen and if you want to watch the video where I programmed this extension I'll link to it in this video's description so now let me reload and then it should be running how about just go to Schiffman net oh it worked good look kittens kittens everywhere kittens it worked so what's nice to see here and actually it's nice to that that this is an open standard that this idea of an extension you can look at the chrome specific API the documentation and make chrome extensions but your code for the most part without and perhaps some minor changes I'm sure I mean this is a very simplistic extension but so there might be other things you can look at this mozilla documentation page to create cross browser extensions cross browser kittens for all so i hope you enjoyed them it has now become a very short video i would be happy to load my other extensions and see how that works let's just at least load one that has a button let's so now i'm going to be ambitious and i'm just going to say load I'm gonna load one that I made for looking up words and getting their definitions from word necks I'm gonna open up this one and I guess I have to within Chrome I select the folder looks like I select the manifesto JSON file so word look up now you can see look my button is there and I can go to let's go to a Wikipedia page for like rainbow and they're still replacing things with cats look I don't have a kitten here and I'm gonna select sky click here and look at that the expanse of air over any given point on the earth the upper atmosphere as seen from the earth service so I'm really discipline some ways I was a disappointed with myself but that's probably the right thing to say right here but I I prowl I wish that I had sort of started with this knowledge and from this point of view because as much as possible I like to use generic and open tools that can be applied to a lot of different things like different browsers or different operating systems but so but hopefully this is this video allows you to see if you want to do one of your extensions for a different browser you can all you can do that so thank you all for watching and I will see you in another time in another video maybe maybe if if you want you could uh yeah okay no no that's fine don't don't just just go on with your day wait wow I can't believe how easy that was alright everybody it is 640 how long has this livestream been QA I am happy to do a QA for a bit for a short amount of time I need to read some more of the random number book and then I need to go and I won't be back for two weeks because of Thanksgiving next week unless I can come up with a way to do a little something before two weeks from now but I will be back in two weeks try microsoft recommends some cool create or recommend some cool creative coding books I would love so my goto resource for that is probably props where I start with start with reprocessing org books gonna be kittens you should probably disable that extension as fun as it is remove how do I it's funny it doesn't look like you can enable and disable I just have to like remove it so this is a good resource for you to start with some creative coding books some that I this is one that I really really love generator design some other books that I've been recently looking at are this is a wonderful book ten print a history of computing and creative computing through the lens of one line of code from the Commodore 64 forth and code is a wonderful book a form and code this is a wonderful book forming code and design and code and design art and architecture a book that I love I wish I had my bookshelf behind me because I could sort of just look through it I mean Lauren McCarthy is getting started with p5.js book which is a port of K series and Ben Fry's book is is great for just getting started with p5.js pretty quickly and then Nick Montfort has a book this is like exploratory programming for the humanities or something something like that exploratory programming for the arts and humanities this is a really nice one as well is there a good resource for creating a I&J s thank you for asking that question what I would say to you right now for those of you who are interested go to deep learn j/s org take a look at that and I really hesitate to show this to you because it's very much in progress but a bunch of us at ITP are working on something called p5 deep learn Chancellor this is the URL for that github.com slash ITP NYU p5 deep learn is this is something we're working on to allow you to do machine learning in this is new KN image classifier that's like wasn't even there this morning and this is what I'm planning been working on this and I suggest you look at the contributors there's been other folks that are contributing to this and this is something that I hope you do a lot of video tutorials with starting in the new year so if you want to get a preview of this and start to look at it you are welcome to do so I would also recommend you take a look at teachable machines which is a project from Google Creative Lab and I plan on maybe using this teachable machines demo in some videos to explain certain machine learning concepts as well hello hello Dan I want to ask I recently graduated and struggling to find a job due to lack of experience I want to pursue software or web development any tips so first I'd like to say is that I don't know that I'm really qualified to answer that question because I'm a little out of the in my own world of making these YouTube tutorials and teaching classes but I will say that from my experience of working with the processing foundation and looking for projects to try to support or participate in that looking at somebody's web presence and their github repositories and how how they document their work is a really important thing so for me often one thing you might think about I mean a resume and your skills and maybe where you went to school and grades or some of those things that you usually think about these are the things that I need to apply for a job but how you and if it's not real and how you document and write about and explain your thinking and process not just your projects and things you've made so not just like look at all of my code but actually look at how I document and explain my code this is a really valuable skill and I think it really shows your it can really show your show your talents in a nice and open generous way so to me that's something that I think can be I aspire to do a good job of and that's something that that that maybe would help so and in that sense maybe getting involved in some open source projects which can sometimes feel scary or maybe it's not for you or you're not welcome or son included are you're gonna say the wrong thing and it's tricky and I would love as much as I can to help with that I certainly would encourage you to get involved with p5.js or processing foundation projects and tweet at me if you're not sure how to do that and hopefully this is something that I could do more on this channel to help get more people involved yeah alessandro asks a similar question low tip asks how do you would you structure an intro uni course for complete news so i don't want to I mean this is like you guys are like feeding me questions to like promote my own stuff but this is in terms of how I would do that is if you look at the learning processing and it's the learning processing book this book is how I think about that I mean it's a it's a you know I probably have new thoughts about this but this is the second edition this is the way that I teach programming here at ITP I'm not actually using this book because this is for the processing programming environment and we're teaching with JavaScript now I'm so getting started with p5.js there's a great book for you to look at for inspiration also but if you're interested you could at least you could also look at our syllabus right which is a github calm slash ITP NYU slash I see em 2017 so this is um this is kind of a outline of the syllabus of what we do in this course I will say that other programs do things in different ways of Boorman art focus and actually cadenza which is a online education company has a course called introduction to visual programming for the arts or something like that that's taught by Lauren McCarthy Casey Reese and Chandler McWilliams and so that that course also is a great model I think and okay Oh shadow plays as asked how's your arm doing thank you for asking it's actually doing really quite well can you even look at me right now do you know which elbow I broke maybe you don't even know it is the right side if I did this now you would know I cannot I cannot bend the right arm fully straight but I can get pretty good extension this is called flexion extension and I have a nice exciting looking scar that I don't know if you can see it but I'm getting stronger I'm feeling much better and thank you for asking are you teaching computer programming class with j/s so I'm gonna wrap this up in a second but yes so I teach at a program called ITP it's part of Tisch School of the Arts at New York University this is the web site it actually says ITP and ima because starting in fall 2018 the undergraduate BFA version of ITP called Interactive Media Arts will be accepting its inaugural class so there's still I think the deadline is not till December first so if you're looking for something to apply to and if you want more information you can tweet at me at Schiffman but this is where I teach so I teach I'm teaching three classes right now it's very hard and it's the end of the semester it's really busy but doing this YouTube channel is really fun for me and rewarding I'm trying to do my best and so I yeah and right so that's usually how I end up picking the content is I'm kind of do video tutorials on the things that I'm teaching at ITP so that I can publish those videos for the students at ITP and also make them publicly available yes so in the course that I'm teaching right now if you want to look for more information is that Schiffman net a twosie I'm gonna take one more question which I don't even see I'm gonna check that so I actually just completely forgot to look at the slack channel again if you want to support the work that I'm doing with a financial contribution which is not at all required it's only if you have the means and feel inclined to do so it's super appreciated but I want to make this accessible for anybody but you can go to patreon.com/scishow coding trained arm extensions alright so Oh chinatown asks in chat just starting to learn code what should i do first I mean there's umpteen ways that I can answer this question and I could point you towards lots of resources that aren't my own which are very good first of all let me just shout out the code newbies podcast I think code newbies is a podcast which is probably one of the friendliest and most welcoming communities they have a Sarang Sarang yet Barik who runs this podcast also started a new CS concepts podcast I've been listening to which is awesome and so I definitely encourage you to check out code newbies but in terms of my youtube channel if I go to youtube.com slash Schiffman this is the playlist for getting started from the beginning so I would encourage you to use that if you want to follow my channel there is also by the way you can also follow this playlist which is also totally from scratch but it's a much older playlist using just a different program there I'm gonna called processing but those would be the two places on my channel to start okay thank you well hello to Brazil Thank You Malvin the waiting music is by Adam Blau I can't hear it atuh Blau on twitter who also wrote the cutting train theme song which is this thing so if you play while I grabbed a random number book so I don't have any plans to remake the processing tutorials but that is an interesting idea I mean in theory I would love to give an infinite time I definitely would but the thing is most of them are still valid that the quality is not so great and but alright why a lot of viewers from Brazil alright I'm just going to read the first two paragraphs of the introduction early in the course of research at the RAND Corporation a demand arose for random numbers these were needed to solve problems of various kinds by experimental probability procedures which have come to be called Monte Carlo methods many of the applications required a large supply of random digits or normal deviance of high quality and the tables presented here were produced to meet those requirements the numbers have been used extensively by research workers at Rand and by many others in the solution of a wide range of problems during the past seven years now when it says the past seven years the original book was published in 1955 so I assume it's referring to the years between 1948 and 1955 alright it's all I have the energy for a Ricardo says the majority here just like this random number reading thing and but first of all I usually try to just do it at the end so you can always just tune it out and it's a little personal challenge to myself so you can humor me but I don't know if that's really true either let's do something unscientific here and create this poll I'm gonna vote yes and you can vote yourself with that URL and I will listen a couple couple more questions I'm looking for more questions Simon it's time for you to go to sleep Alvin asks about the ITP show it is the ITP show is December set let's look it up ITP dot NYU dot edu slash show December 17th and December 18th I should be here at both so please say hi if you come Jenner of synthesis music in p5 I did a video a little bit about that but not so I should do more oh boy this song is a minute and a half left should I learn p5 before native JavaScript which one should I go for a first I mean you're kind of asking the wrong person because most people won't answer the question the way that I'll answer it but I think learning p5 starting with the p5 library is a nice entry point to learning the basics of programming and from there you could investigate native JavaScript at the same time afterwards during but just having the sort of simplicity of the p5 environment it's you know if you're just in graphics and animation and beginner friendly stuff and making art that's what I would start with I'm a computer science major and my biggest problem is just how to solve the purp the problem not the coding itself did this ever happen to you all the time yes definitely it's really hard is p5 just the environment to program JavaScript for and kind of use the exact same code and just you can you have to make sure you import the libraries someone's asking if I plan any meetups I did attend processing day which was really fun I hope to you know so I hope I try to announce if I'm gonna be in a conference or anything I don't I would love I love the idea of doing more live events but I'm not so sure how to make that happen how many hours till the video ondemand abyss is uploaded it actually will be available immediately but it usually is usually available immediately unlisted so if you want the link it's pretty easy to find or you can tweet it me or something but once I have the description everything written it'll be released as public sometime this weekend probably alright you guys are the greatest even that many votes but okay thank you everybody we could refresh the results everybody's gone everybody's asleep my throat hurts been talking for three hours straight it's seven o'clock thank you everybody for tuning in to this today is coding trade I won't see you again for two weeks at least live on YouTube all these videos will get published though slowly over time the edited versions and I'm on Twitter although I think I probably should get off Twitter and join Mastodon because Twitter is kind of an awful place but for the moment I'm still there at Schiffman and this laptop died have to plug it back in and so thank you alright goodbye everybody I will play you and anybody anybody want to watch the trailer on the way out now I'm just gonna industry okay thank you everyone
