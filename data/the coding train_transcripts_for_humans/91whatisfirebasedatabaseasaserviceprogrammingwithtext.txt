00:02 - hello I am here today in this video to
00:05 - talk to you about something called
00:06 - database as service so I want to put it
00:08 - in the context of kind of web web
00:11 - programming in general and you know this
00:13 - video is kind of sandwiched in the
00:14 - middle it's you know you could just be
00:16 - here just to learn about databases and
00:18 - JavaScript and all that sort of stuff
00:20 - but it's in the middle of this
00:21 - programming from a toz playlist and so
00:23 - I'm going to sort of set this topic in
00:24 - that context so I've been using a
00:27 - variety of different tools and libraries
00:30 - and Frameworks in making web
00:32 - applications around text in this video
00:35 - series one is called uh p5js which is a
00:40 - client Side Library for JavaScript and
00:43 - it has lots of nice things in it like
00:44 - drawing to the canvas and some Dom
00:46 - manipulation and it
00:48 - lives on a client like which I will draw
00:52 - as like a little laptop here you know
00:54 - and happens in the browser now another
00:57 - aspect that I have explored is something
00:59 - called uh node.js
01:01 - also a framework for writing code in
01:05 - JavaScript for server side programming
01:07 - so and the the code that we've run runs
01:11 - on a server now if you've watched some
01:12 - of my previous videos you would have
01:14 - noticed that I'm running both the client
01:16 - in the server on one computer just to
01:18 - like mess around and try stuff and learn
01:19 - stuff and because I'm just you
01:21 - know coding um but if you were deploying
01:25 - making a big thing and putting it out
01:26 - into the world you would actually put it
01:28 - on some server somewhere whether you
01:29 - have like an Amazon account or your own
01:31 - account or whatever and then you might
01:33 - have lots and lots of clients all
01:35 - connecting to that server now one of the
01:37 - things I explored is that on the server
01:40 - you could store
01:42 - data uh one of the examples I made just
01:45 - writes data to a like a local text file
01:47 - a Json a JavaScript object notation text
01:50 - file that sits here so you can think of
01:52 - the simplest scenario here is like you
01:53 - made a game that people are playing in
01:55 - p5js and whenever they finish the game
01:57 - it sends the score to the server if it's
02:00 - a high score it gets saved into the file
02:03 - and then if somebody else comes to play
02:04 - later they can request and see the
02:06 - current high scores and their score can
02:08 - get saved into a file so this is one
02:11 - something I've done and I've
02:12 - demonstrated and if you can go backwards
02:13 - in video time you could see the pieces
02:15 - of
02:16 - this you could get more sophisticated
02:19 - than just a local text file you could
02:22 - actually have you know a proper so to
02:24 - speak database and you would need that
02:26 - if you have large amounts of data or if
02:30 - uh you needed you know you know
02:32 - encrypted passwords and all sorts of
02:33 - things and you want additional
02:34 - functionality a database and you could
02:36 - learn mongod DB or couchdb and you can
02:38 - install that and get a node package and
02:40 - all that what I'm here today in this
02:42 - video to show you the beginning steps of
02:45 - how to work with something called
02:47 - database as service so what if there
02:49 - something else existed oh I I I made it
02:52 - a cloud nothing is a cloud there is no
02:54 - there are clouds it rains but there's no
02:57 - there's no clouds in the internet so
02:59 - this other let's let me erase that I
03:01 - don't know where my Eraser went
03:05 - uh here it is um okay so uh there's
03:10 - another what if there were another
03:11 - server somewhere so this is a server
03:13 - that's you know you have some ownership
03:14 - or account over this is your client but
03:16 - what if there was a server that wasn't
03:18 - yours and that you could actually
03:19 - eliminate this and you could just say
03:22 - hey save this data for me could I get
03:24 - this data back and you wouldn't have to
03:25 - write the server the node program set up
03:27 - the database it would just exist and it
03:29 - would have an API and interface for you
03:32 - to make calls to it so this is what's
03:35 - known as
03:37 - database as
03:40 - service exclamation point database as
03:44 - service so this is incredibly useful
03:46 - because you don't have to have you don't
03:47 - have to like set up configure this is
03:49 - like easy just like you know hey can you
03:51 - say you know hey databases service could
03:53 - you save this for me and I might ask you
03:54 - for it later so now there are lots of
03:57 - examples of this a particular product
03:59 - that I'm going to show you in this video
04:01 - and the next and the next one is
04:03 - something called Firebase which is uh it
04:05 - wasn't originally uh created by Google
04:07 - but I believe Google Google acquired it
04:09 - so it's a it's a Google service um there
04:12 - is um there's something that I really
04:14 - like also called sheet
04:16 - Sue uh for um turning a Google sheet
04:19 - into an API that you can save data to
04:22 - and request data from um I'm going to
04:24 - sheet shetu doesn't have a lot of great
04:27 - free options as far as I can tell maybe
04:29 - somebody can correct me in the comments
04:30 - and I'll come back and do a video about
04:31 - it but as far as I can tell you can only
04:33 - have one Google sheet and 300 calls per
04:35 - month so I'm going to focus on Firebase
04:37 - which is has quite a lot that you can do
04:39 - with it without a paid account um you
04:41 - know there's limits to that of course um
04:43 - and then there are probably other
04:45 - examples that you can add in the
04:46 - comments if there are things that you
04:47 - use that I should explore in a future
04:49 - video or that sort of thing so this is
04:52 - uh oh but I should mention the last
04:53 - thing I want to mention here in this
04:54 - kind of introductory explanation
04:58 - is you also don't have to cut this out
05:01 - so you could still have your node
05:03 - program and your node program could also
05:05 - connect to databases service so there's
05:08 - you know it just sort of depends if you
05:09 - only need client side code and you just
05:11 - want to save some data and you don't you
05:13 - know security isn't too much of an issue
05:14 - for you um this is going to be just fine
05:17 - uh if you have some other server side
05:18 - components but you don't want to deal
05:20 - with setting up your own database you
05:21 - could still use the databa service and
05:23 - the server and your client everything is
05:26 - possible so um this is my sort of
05:28 - introduction to why this matters and in
05:31 - the next video I'm going to just get
05:32 - started with a how to set up a Firebase
05:35 - account and how to send data to it from
05:37 - p5js or any JavaScript program really
05:40 - and how to request data from any
05:42 - JavaScript program and I'll see you in
05:43 - the next video if you're interested
05:48 - [Music]
