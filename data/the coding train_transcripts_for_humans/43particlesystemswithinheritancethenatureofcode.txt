00:00 - Hi, so I'm expecting--
00:02 - I don't know if this is true--
00:03 - for you to have
watched my videos
00:05 - about inheritance
and polymorphism
00:08 - before watching this one.
00:10 - It's fine if you didn't.
00:11 - Maybe this will
be useful to you.
00:12 - Maybe you already know about
inheritance and polymorphism.
00:15 - But I am basically going
to take those concepts
00:17 - from those videos and
apply it to this example
00:20 - that I did in the
last particle system
00:22 - example, which had just a single
kind of class called particle.
00:27 - And the first thing
that I'm going to do,
00:28 - which I think is an
interesting thing
00:29 - to think about, whether there's
a lot of value to this in all
00:32 - of my nature of
code examples, is
00:34 - add the idea of having particle
itself extend p5.Vector.
00:40 - What does that mean?
00:42 - That means instead of having
a separate position variable,
00:46 - the position itself,
the vector itself
00:49 - is just the particle is
embedded into the particle
00:51 - object because it's inheriting
everything from p5 Vector.
00:55 - So I can say super x,y to create
it as a p5 vector at that x,y.
01:00 - Then anywhere that I'm using
position-- and by the way,
01:03 - I'm not using this
Edges function,
01:04 - so I'm just going to take it out
completely-- anywhere that I'm
01:07 - using the position is now
just the object itself.
01:11 - This dot add, this
dot x, this dot y.
01:16 - Right?
01:17 - So that's it.
01:18 - Now, this particle object
inherits everything
01:21 - from p5 vector.
01:23 - Next, what would it
mean for me to add
01:25 - a class that extends particle.
01:33 - So I'm adding a new JavaScript
file called Confetti.js
01:40 - and creating a new
kind of particle
01:42 - that inherits everything
from particle, which
01:44 - inherits everything from p5
vector in this class called
01:47 - Confetti.
01:48 - And I don't remember
exactly what
01:50 - I did as the demonstration of
making a new kind of particle
01:53 - in the previous videos, but
what I'm going to add here
01:56 - is just this idea of an angle.
01:58 - And I'm going to make it a
random angle between 0 and 2pi.
02:02 - Then I'm going to override
the Show function.
02:12 - I've written a new Show function
that just draws this Confetti
02:16 - particle a different way.
02:18 - So the way it updates
itself, all the other things
02:20 - that it does, the physics
of it are entirely the same.
02:22 - From the particle
class, I'm inheriting
02:24 - the Finished function, the
Apply Force function, the Update
02:27 - function.
02:28 - I just don't want to draw
it as a plain old ellipse.
02:30 - I'm just rewriting
the Show function.
02:33 - And of course, once again,
I've forgotten this dot.
02:35 - Let me catch that error first.
02:36 - This dot angle.
02:37 - And you might say, like, well,
where is this dot lifetime
02:40 - and where is this dot r?
02:41 - All of those properties
are inherited, once again,
02:44 - from the particle class itself.
02:47 - Oh, I've just got some
characters out of order here.
02:51 - Particle is not defined.
02:53 - Oh, interesting.
02:54 - I didn't think of this.
02:56 - The Confetti class is
extending particle,
02:58 - but doesn't seem to
know what a particle is.
03:00 - Why is that?
03:01 - I think this is one of
those rare occasions where
03:04 - the order of these
JavaScript files embedded
03:07 - into the index.HTML
really matters.
03:10 - The Confetti.js file
is included first,
03:15 - but Confetti is
based on particle.
03:17 - So I think particle
has to be here.
03:19 - And I think just conceptually
it might make sense for me
03:22 - to say particle
confetti emitter sketch.
03:26 - All right, the sketch
is still running,
03:28 - but I don't see
anything different.
03:30 - I just see all of
my plain particles.
03:32 - If I look at the
emitter class, I'll
03:34 - see that the only thing I'm
ever adding to the array
03:37 - are particle objects.
03:38 - Let's try changing those
to confetti objects.
03:44 - There we go it.
03:45 - Might be hard to
tell exactly here.
03:46 - But those are little
squares that are rotated.
03:49 - Let's make them a
little bit bigger,
03:52 - and add just one per frame.
03:56 - And now, I think that's
more obvious visually
03:58 - for you to see that those
are squares and not circles.
04:00 - What if I want to have both?
04:02 - Well, now, I have to ask
myself the question, what
04:04 - is the logic behind why I might
want to have one or the other.
04:08 - Is it just randomly
both of them?
04:09 - Maybe I'll just start there.
04:13 - Now, I've added some code.
04:14 - Pick a random number
between 0 and 1.
04:16 - If it's less than 0.5,
add a particle object.
04:19 - If it's greater than 0.5,
add a confetti object.
04:21 - So I'm flipping a coin--
particle or confetti.
04:26 - And hopefully, you can see now
that both kinds of particles
04:30 - are included.
04:31 - So that begs the
question, what's
04:33 - a good exercise for you to try?
04:34 - Well, first of all, maybe
add a third class that
04:37 - extends a particle to this.
04:39 - Think about how that
particle is different.
04:41 - Maybe you might come up with
a different more intentional
04:43 - logic behind why you might
pick one kind of particle
04:46 - versus another.
04:47 - But I do want to
address something here,
04:48 - which I think is really
an important question.
04:51 - When do you want to have another
class that extends a class
04:55 - versus just add something
that's like a twist
04:58 - on the original class?
04:59 - For example, if what
I wanted to have now
05:01 - is particles of a
different color,
05:03 - I probably wouldn't
write a whole class
05:06 - called color particle.
05:07 - I might just add to
my Particle.js file
05:10 - a variable like this color.
05:13 - But again, there's no
right or wrong answers
05:15 - to these questions.
05:16 - But to me, the
fact that I wanted
05:18 - to override an entire function
the entire way that it's
05:22 - drawn using a different
shape entirely,
05:25 - that made sense for me to
create a new class that
05:28 - extended particle,
rather than have
05:30 - some kind of IF statement of if
it's this type, draw a circle,
05:33 - or otherwise else draw a square.
05:35 - So that's the way I'm
thinking about it right now.
05:37 - I wonder how you're
thinking about it.
05:39 - Definitely would love to hear
your feedback in the comments.
05:41 - But this really wraps
up this exploration
05:44 - of the concepts of
inheritance and polymorphism
05:47 - with particles systems in
chapter four of Nature of Code.
05:51 - I've got one more
thing that I want
05:53 - to look at with
particle systems,
05:54 - and that's a little bit
more about how you might
05:56 - choose to render a particle.
05:58 - What does it mean to have the
particle rendered as an image
06:02 - texture, as well as explore
different blend modes in P5 JS.
06:06 - What kinds of visual effects
can you create that way?
06:08 - So that'll be in the next video.
