06:39 - and you're seeing me right now I'm
06:40 - seeing me right now because I have a
06:42 - monitor in front of me that shows me my
06:44 - face
06:46 - hi Dan I know
06:48 - I'm very uncomfortable uh normally what
06:52 - I do at the beginning of a coding train
06:53 - live stream is I make a sound from a
06:56 - train whistle I have so many train
06:59 - whistles right now
07:01 - but we will use because I know Stig
07:04 - is in the audience oh wait a second here
07:07 - I don't I don't see the chat in my
07:08 - Monitor let me open this let me get this
07:10 - out here so I can keep an eye the corner
07:13 - of my eye on the chat
07:15 - uh
07:17 - all right
07:19 - all right just uh bear with me here I
07:23 - did not uh this is back to back to the
07:27 - roots of the coding train where I barely
07:29 - was set up and ready to go when the time
07:33 - arrived for me to stream uh okay
07:37 - um
07:38 - thank you to the people of Denmark Who
07:41 - present it wasn't really the people of
07:43 - Denmark it was a small group who
07:45 - gathered this past summer for proston
07:47 - community in Copenhagen and uh uh gave
07:50 - me this wonderful treasured gift now of
07:52 - mine a authentic 1950s era uh Danish
07:56 - train whistle actually used by Danish
07:59 - train conductors in Denmark uh and I
08:03 - will begin today's live stream with the
08:04 - traditional blowing of the train whistle
08:06 - it's like it's like uh for Rosh Hashanah
08:08 - we blow the shofar and here on the
08:11 - coding train we blow the train whistle
08:13 - for the new year it's not the New Year
08:14 - it's like November it's not even the
08:16 - beginning of a school year or the
08:18 - beginning of January or any sort of New
08:21 - Year under any calendars at Lunar New
08:22 - Year nope none of those things
08:25 - it's just been a while since I live
08:27 - streamed so it feels like the start of
08:28 - something new
08:33 - thank you thank you for indulging me
08:35 - with that
08:37 - um
08:38 - and I know uh rlb in the chat is saying
08:42 - Danish dan-ish but that's one of the
08:45 - things that I especially enjoyed about
08:47 - being Denmark uh everything was called
08:50 - like dance not everything but a lot of
08:52 - things were called Dan something for
08:54 - example I could hail a Dan taxi the taxi
08:56 - service was Dan taxi I'm I'm probably
08:58 - pronouncing that incorrectly but I quite
09:00 - enjoyed it hello to uh XX Mr PhD
09:05 - um Osama Issa says you speak so fast no
09:07 - I don't you're watching 1.5x don't you
09:08 - know you're watching one before right
09:09 - check your settings it's 1.5 x living
09:12 - life at 3x baby
09:14 - if anybody knows that reference if
09:17 - anybody knows that reference I will send
09:19 - you a coding trade t-shirt
09:23 - okay
09:25 - I couldn't grade teachers don't even
09:27 - exist but I will have them made but
09:29 - actually that is a sec that is related
09:31 - to today's live stream
09:33 - uh Kathy says hello everybody say thank
09:35 - you to Kathy many other people too but
09:38 - Kathy for uh has been doing a tremendous
09:41 - amount of work on the coding Train
09:43 - website which I will be going through
09:44 - and talking about today
09:46 - um one thing I'm wondering about
09:48 - um
09:49 - is
09:52 - in in the time since I last live
09:55 - streamed
09:56 - um I believe YouTube released a new q a
10:00 - feature
10:01 - for live streaming and I didn't have
10:04 - quite a bit smart to do didn't bother to
10:06 - check if I had to enable that or
10:08 - anything on a live stream but is that
10:10 - feature running
10:12 - does anybody know does anybody know
10:14 - anything about it I've got I've got a
10:16 - second computer over here in case you're
10:18 - wondering I used to cover my second
10:20 - computer with a green paper so it was
10:21 - invisible did I just put it off to the
10:23 - side but let me double check let me take
10:25 - a look at the stream page
10:29 - um
10:31 - and
10:33 - um
10:35 - uh to kind of ask a question engage with
10:38 - your audience start a q a oh oh it's me
10:41 - I have to do it I'm gonna start a q a
10:45 - oh Marco Silvio oh no no sound
10:55 - that's the song I usually play when
10:57 - somebody joins the membership but the
11:00 - iPad where I play sound effects
11:03 - oh it's me talking to myself uh it's
11:07 - it's it won't come alive it's been
11:09 - plugged in for like an hour also the
11:11 - heat is on
11:12 - here it is on and um it's getting kind
11:14 - of warm in here so I'm now going to turn
11:16 - that off
11:18 - um because it is a loud noise
11:21 - uh it is an electric heater that is just
11:24 - one of these garage heaters because I am
11:25 - in a garage space
11:27 - um I think it's time for me to do a tour
11:28 - of this space soon uh because it's kind
11:31 - of ready for that
11:33 - um wait okay oh and coding Garden is
11:36 - here I don't know go to Garden hopefully
11:38 - you didn't mind my hilarious tweet this
11:41 - morning
11:42 - I don't know if you could you still go
11:43 - find my tweet does Twitter's Twitter
11:45 - still up by the way I had this idea
11:47 - digression after digression after
11:49 - digression is the name of the game on
11:51 - the coding train but
11:52 - um
11:54 - what are we going to do today was what
11:55 - some people had asked in the chat and I
11:57 - was kind of thinking oh we should just
11:58 - mess around with Twitter while it's
12:00 - still active but I made a tweet this
12:01 - morning to share the live stream that um
12:04 - coding Garden came and did as a guest I
12:07 - think this was back in 2018
12:09 - like another like another era of like
12:13 - like that's like a hundred years ago at
12:15 - this in in today's time
12:18 - um
12:19 - in Internet time but uh where he
12:22 - demonstrated how to build a full stack
12:24 - clone of Twitter so I thought hey why
12:27 - don't we just rebuild Twitter today I
12:28 - think it was Beck Hill who I'm like Beck
12:31 - Hill's number one fan ever since um I
12:33 - got to see her perform at the evening of
12:35 - unnecessary uh detail there's a fly
12:40 - let me know if you can hear it
12:42 - it's in the light that likes my light
12:44 - um tweeted something about starting
12:46 - something new called shrub and all your
12:49 - followers are leaves so that works with
12:51 - coding Garden so we could just rebuild
12:53 - Twitter today on today's live stream
12:55 - what do you guys think about that
12:57 - probably not what we're gonna do
12:59 - um but uh uh in the before times okay
13:02 - start a q a wait no no okay
13:04 - but I was coming back to something the
13:06 - membership let's let's go for the Q a
13:08 - we're gonna see how this works
13:10 - start a q a say something oh
13:13 - uh I have to start a q i I'm starting a
13:17 - Q and A oh q a
13:21 - start q a
13:24 - okay I started a q a questions
13:29 - so I think if you post a question it'll
13:31 - show up now
13:34 - interesting I'm looking at on this side
13:35 - I'm slightly afraid to bring it on to my
13:37 - live stream
13:39 - um also uh yeah
13:41 - gosh I have so many things to talk about
13:43 - today and I I kind of had some notes uh
13:47 - um
13:48 - wait there are questions but they're
13:50 - just showing up in the chat
13:54 - like shouldn't they show up somewhere
13:56 - else
13:57 - I see is this working I see questions
14:02 - oh I just see questions but this is no
14:04 - different than watching the chat are you
14:06 - all posting to the questions like am I
14:09 - not seeing regular chat or there's
14:10 - separate chats I have no idea what's
14:12 - going on
14:14 - there's like a lot of questions way too
14:15 - many questions for me to answer biggest
14:17 - fear
14:20 - you know I had one of those dreams
14:22 - no let's not get into that
14:26 - edit that out oh wait I'm live sorry
14:29 - what
14:31 - Oregon Trail is an old game right it
14:34 - brings back a lot of memory
14:37 - yes
14:38 - so my planned topic for today is to and
14:43 - uh I don't let's see if this button's
14:45 - gonna work
14:47 - uh uh oh wait a second did I not make a
14:50 - button for it
14:51 - okay hold on please hold I can see the
14:55 - question I can see the questions but
14:57 - it's just a stream of questions
14:59 - like literally look I love YouTube and I
15:03 - appreciate all of the tremendous amount
15:06 - of work and features that are available
15:08 - the decoding crane would not just about
15:10 - YouTube so I don't really mean this as a
15:12 - criticism I know this is a new feature
15:13 - it's in beta or maybe alpha or maybe
15:15 - it's not but um and I do I do like that
15:17 - I'm seeing a lot of questions but I
15:20 - would what I think it needs is some
15:21 - organization to the questions or maybe
15:23 - maybe I just need a moderator to pick
15:25 - them out and there's some way I can you
15:27 - know through the uh I'm sure very easily
15:30 - accessible and beginner friendly YouTube
15:32 - API
15:34 - bring
15:35 - um bring questions onto the screen uh
15:38 - okay will I actually play the Oregon
15:40 - drug yes yes yes okay hold on uh so
15:42 - let's end the Q a because this is not
15:44 - working I'll do the Q a later and when
15:47 - I'm just focused on it I can look at the
15:49 - questions and answer the questions but
15:51 - right now I am not ready to do the Q a
15:54 - uh so uh coding Garden writes I have
15:57 - specifically sent this in the question
16:00 - box so there is a question box and now
16:02 - if I hit n q a
16:05 - it will remove all the questions that's
16:08 - terrible okay hold on questions
16:10 - top live chat okay
16:13 - I'm going to leave that open
16:15 - so I can now switch
16:18 - to the chat again
16:21 - I think questions live chat this is so I
16:25 - think it's very useful but
16:28 - um I think and probably the intention is
16:31 - for a moderator to be uh kind of
16:35 - operating
16:37 - the chat
16:39 - stuff because I can't easily with the
16:42 - way I run my live streams switch back
16:44 - and forth maybe I should have two
16:46 - different monitors one of the questions
16:47 - one with the chat I don't know sorry for
16:50 - not having a plan about that but I see
16:51 - Marcelo Silva's I posted a question but
16:54 - this is a regular chat message
16:58 - okay
16:59 - so
17:01 - um
17:02 - oh I know what I could do
17:04 - I can see the chat over here
17:07 - and then I can put the questions over
17:09 - here
17:10 - on this screen
17:12 - I'm a genius genius
17:14 - I have multiple screens
17:17 - okay but don't show me the Q a box I
17:19 - want to see the questions there we go
17:21 - all right so I see your questions here
17:24 - which oh that's the chat questions okay
17:28 - I see your questions here there are so
17:31 - many of them and then I see your chat
17:33 - here
17:34 - so okay
17:37 - uh thank you rlb for your lovely message
17:41 - hello from Belarus
17:44 - um all right so it's already been I
17:47 - don't know like 10 minutes or so I
17:48 - haven't done anything at all let me add
17:50 - my button for what we're going to do
17:53 - today
17:54 - because this is going to be necessary
17:57 - add a scene scene a scene
18:01 - I'm going to put it here and I'm going
18:04 - to call it Oregon Trail
18:07 - uh and it's going to be the
18:10 - um
18:13 - Apple II
18:14 - okay
18:16 - um okay that should do it let's see if

18:23 - just very briefly
18:28 - okay so I'm over here now
18:30 - um and when we get to the Oregon Trail

18:38 - blue you're not saying it the blue thing
18:40 - you are seeing will be the output of

19:36 - link that you're going to want
19:37 - codingtrain.com choo choo so oh not Cody
19:41 - wait it says codingtrain.com that's not
19:44 - what it should say
19:45 - [Laughter]
19:47 - oops okay I will redirect that look
19:50 - we're going to live through a pull

20:26 - curiositystream.com that's the URL
20:29 - you're going to want let's go to uh
20:33 - GitHub
20:34 - welcome to the coding train
20:37 - uh GitHub a coding train
20:42 - slash the coding train
20:44 - um there is a nice little redirects dot
20:47 - Json file right here that I can very
20:50 - quickly uh
20:53 - am I not logged in oh
20:58 - sign up no I don't want to sign up I

23:45 - this pull request soon enough okay so
23:47 - let's go over to Discord so if you
23:49 - aren't in the coding train Discord
23:52 - um come and join us this is at
23:54 - thecodytrain.com Discord
23:56 - um it is where I once a month will post
23:59 - an announcement about things going on

24:22 - their use of at everyone than the coding
24:25 - train is for you
24:29 - um
24:29 - so let's talk about things that have
24:31 - been happening I have a new coding
24:34 - challenge video out it's about 45

25:28 - um so if you haven't noticed these and
25:30 - want to check them out
25:32 - um uh you know this link is available in
25:34 - the Discord
25:36 - um
25:37 - but you could come see one of the recent
25:39 - shorts that I posted there also his Tick
25:42 - Tock account I'm sorry to disappoint you
25:45 - but I have yet to do any uh Dancing In
25:48 - The Tick Tock account although I was
25:49 - ahead of my time was I not because I
25:52 - remember live streaming I don't know
25:54 - five plus years ago where I would play
25:57 - music and dance around that was my thing
26:01 - uh the other announcement here is that
26:03 - there is a live stream incoming oh wait
26:05 - that's right now that's what you're
26:07 - watching right now so if you want to get
26:09 - notifications about when the live
26:11 - streams are happening uh Beyond uh
26:14 - YouTube If you subscribe and bell and
26:16 - all that I do tend to try to announce
26:18 - them in Discord
26:19 - um there is a notifications role if
26:23 - you're not aware if you're already in
26:24 - the Discord you can sign up for a
26:25 - notifications role which uh will get you
26:27 - additional notifications beyond my more
26:30 - rare uh everyone
26:33 - um the Discord invite is not working
26:35 - okay this is why I live stream to
26:37 - discover these things let's can anyone
26:40 - confirm or deny that this is the case
26:43 - let's go thecodingtrain.com Discord
26:48 - okay invite invalid
26:51 - okay wait guess what guess where that
26:54 - goes it's a redirect
26:58 - so we're here why not welcome to
27:02 - cryptocurity train where I reprogram
27:04 - redirects on my website I find broken
27:07 - links and fix them live streaming for
27:09 - hours on end finding broken links and
27:12 - fixing them okay edit
27:16 - Edith no what do I do what do ah edit
27:19 - file
27:20 - so let's first figure out where is the
27:23 - redirect
27:25 - Discord Discord Discord
27:28 - okay
27:30 - I thought we had this back
27:34 - okay let's try
27:36 - is it the coding train we might have
27:39 - changed it to that
27:40 - nope
27:41 - okay so we're gonna I'm gonna create I
27:44 - don't think this is gonna show anything
27:47 - uh we'll have to figure that out later
27:49 - but I think if I go here
27:51 - and then do uh invite people
27:56 - um and
27:57 - edit link
28:00 - um
28:03 - No Limit
28:05 - expire never generate a new link copy
28:09 - and
28:13 - um
28:15 - let's
28:17 - then go back to here
28:19 - and paste that in there so we'll use
28:22 - this invite right now I don't know what
28:24 - happened to our fancy
28:26 - um
28:27 - other uh vanity URL but this should now
28:32 - be fixed
28:34 - and the Discord link worked for me says
28:37 - Clara
28:38 - okay well I don't know now the invite in
28:40 - the video description works
28:43 - oh interesting what's in there
28:46 - I guess I could have just grabbed that
28:47 - one but I'm not going to worry about it
28:49 - right now I will figure this out later
28:51 - at the moment uh apparently there's an
28:54 - invite in the video description that
28:55 - should work and then uh this new one
28:59 - that I just added to here should also
29:01 - work okay back to Discord
29:05 - um the other thing that I really wanted
29:06 - to mention
29:09 - is that
29:11 - um
29:11 - coding train social media is doing some
29:14 - new uh things let's see it's Twitter is
29:16 - Twitter still up looks like it
29:18 - um so on Instagram
29:20 - you'll see there are two posted right
29:22 - now uh what we are doing is sharing
29:25 - projects from the passenger showcase
29:26 - which is a new feature on the website so
29:29 - if you've ever made something related to
29:32 - and it can be very Loosely related to
29:34 - like my goal is for people to share what
29:36 - they're doing and the organizing
29:38 - principle of the coding Train website is
29:40 - to take a project and share it
29:43 - associated with one of my videos which
29:45 - isn't the maybe the
29:47 - you know maybe someday I'll have to
29:48 - rethink that so but you know don't worry
29:51 - it's not required that you like watch
29:53 - the video you started with the sample
29:55 - code you were made this project and it
29:57 - doesn't have to be so perfect so if you
29:59 - made something you want to share if it's
30:01 - related to uh if you made something that
30:03 - uses the seller automata algorithm you
30:05 - know find the video that that uses that
30:07 - I have I have something for everyone
30:09 - so if we look at any of these uh most
30:12 - recently let's look at the more rows I'm
30:13 - not logged in so I guess I can't click
30:15 - on these
30:16 - um but um you could have your work
30:18 - featured on the coding train social
30:21 - media so tag the coding train on Twitter
30:23 - or the dot coding.train on Instagram
30:29 - um and uh please submit to the passenger
30:32 - showcase if you're wondering what I'm
30:33 - talking about with the passenger
30:34 - showcase
30:36 - um what that is and and soon coming soon
30:38 - in fact I'm supposed to have a meeting
30:39 - about this today
30:41 - uh there will be a new page under
30:44 - Community which is just the page for
30:46 - just the Showcase which will show all
30:47 - the Showcase projects we're working on
30:49 - that but right now you can see uh here
30:52 - on the homepage there are passenger
30:54 - showcase highlights they cycle through
30:56 - different ones so we can see image
30:58 - dithering uh Labyrinth so that's wild
31:01 - let's take a look at this one
31:03 - um this is based off of oh I love this
31:07 - that is what that is lovely
31:11 - let's try I gotta get this soundboard
31:13 - working
31:14 - so I don't have to keep singing
31:17 - let's try plugging it into a different
31:19 - plug
31:21 - I mean that should work
31:25 - I'm gonna just try plugging into this
31:26 - laptop see if it'll charge off of this
31:29 - laptop which might be a bad idea for a
31:31 - variety of reasons but we'll see
31:34 - um is there any chance of a coding trade
31:36 - Mastodon instance
31:38 - oh oh oh funny you should ask
31:43 - this is a great project thank you let me
31:45 - let me Circle back to that
31:47 - um and then
31:49 - um if you go to any given coding
31:51 - challenge like if I go to this poisson
31:52 - disk on here we'll see the video the
31:55 - time codes
31:57 - um the source code for it and then oh my
32:00 - goodness what
32:02 - nobody has submitted you could be the
32:05 - first you could submit a plaso plasso
32:12 - projects
32:13 - uh to this page be the first one
32:15 - featured here so we're gonna have to go
32:16 - to a different
32:17 - uh challenge let's try Purple Rain I
32:21 - know has a lot
32:23 - so you can see here
32:25 - um here are all the projects that have
32:27 - been submitted uh related to the Purple
32:29 - Rain video and if I click on any one of
32:32 - them we can take a look at it Casio I
32:36 - love this this is fantastic
32:39 - um
32:40 - so oh PB is asking
32:42 - um this is so funny I have a q a going
32:45 - and I'm answering the questions from the
32:47 - live chat this is very on brand for me
32:49 - to like completely mess this up
32:53 - uh uh okay uh oh so many good questions
32:58 - um okay coding Garden is handling that
33:00 - one in the chat uh thank you thank you
33:03 - uh for uh coded Garden to handle that
33:05 - and and let me just read the the comment
33:07 - when working on a team it is better to
33:09 - commit to a separate branch and then
33:10 - have your changes reviewed by other team
33:12 - members before merging into Maine and so
33:16 - um
33:17 - this is also true like for the coding
33:19 - Train website the main branch is the
33:22 - deployment Branch so if I were to submit
33:25 - a change if I were to merge commit that
33:28 - directly to Maine and it had a mistake
33:30 - in it it could break the website and by
33:33 - committing it to another Branch the
33:34 - GitHub system actually runs through a
33:37 - set of tests and offers the chance to
33:39 - check it before it's merged this doesn't
33:42 - mean you can't break stuff like it's no
33:44 - different than me making the pull
33:45 - request and then just merging it but
33:47 - there are a few checks and balances and
33:48 - tests that run along the way that's what
33:50 - I'm waiting for to happen so right here
33:54 - um we can see I think it's actually done
33:57 - all successful yeah sorry so it's
33:58 - actually done now all the tests checks
34:01 - have passed usually there's a lot more
34:02 - so I don't know what's going on here but
34:04 - uh and maybe it's just because I'm
34:08 - anyway the tests have passed
34:10 - it's got a deploy preview I'm not really
34:12 - sure what's going on but I'm going to
34:14 - merge it
34:16 - um and then we'll also take the site
34:18 - takes quite a while to build because of
34:20 - the amount of content and the Gatsby
34:22 - system that I'm using so the redirect
34:24 - probably won't be live just yet it could
34:28 - be like 20 minutes to be honest like it
34:29 - takes a built so I'll come back to it
34:31 - we'll check it
34:32 - [Music]
34:33 - um
34:34 - uh lots of questions about all the
34:36 - Twitter drama I don't I'm I'm not I
34:39 - don't think I'll be addressing the
34:41 - Twitter drama other than uh making
34:43 - poorly uh thought out
34:46 - not funny dad jokes about it um to the
34:50 - best of my ability okay
34:52 - back to announcements
34:55 - anything else oh and so more about the
34:57 - website I was kind of showing you some
34:59 - of the features of the website and it is
35:00 - my intention to make a video
35:02 - announcement about the website even if
35:04 - that's like a year after the website
35:06 - launched uh if anybody wants to help
35:07 - with that I don't you know I don't know
35:10 - that's really a serious call for help
35:11 - because I don't know what what help I
35:13 - really need other than getting myself to
35:14 - do it but I really want to encourage
35:16 - people to read this uh very
35:19 - um thoughtful case study report about
35:22 - all the design thinking and
35:25 - um uh process and methodology that went
35:28 - in and I'm my green screen is it is it
35:32 - this that's what's no it's over here
35:34 - what's over here oh this is uh this is a
35:38 - bookcase
35:39 - so hold on that's really bothering me so
35:43 - I just need to like
35:45 - turn the camera slightly that way and I
35:47 - think it will go away
35:48 - yeah
35:51 - this is a bell
35:53 - um which I can put over the side
35:56 - um
35:57 - but um there's a lot of thought and care
36:00 - and time went into the work on this
36:02 - website from Design Systems
36:04 - International and obviously a ton of
36:06 - people from the coding train Community
36:08 - who really helped
36:10 - so and you should check out all the work
36:12 - of Design Systems International but if
36:14 - you want to learn about web design and
36:18 - systems design I think I I would like to
36:21 - think that you will learn a lot and be
36:22 - inspired by their wonderful work on the
36:25 - coding Train website
36:28 - um okay
36:31 - uh look let me take a question I'm just
36:33 - gonna every once in a while I'm gonna
36:35 - look over on the Q a and I'm gonna pluck
36:37 - a question from thin air
36:38 - oh the heat came back on it it got cold
36:41 - in here I guess
36:42 - um let me know if the audio bothers you
36:45 - um much with the that going do you work
36:48 - full time for YouTube well first of all
36:50 - I definitely don't work full-time for
36:52 - YouTube I think what the question means
36:54 - is do you do YouTube your YouTube work
36:58 - is that your kind of full-time job or do
37:01 - you still actually program for a living
37:02 - so the answer to that is neither
37:04 - I definitely don't actually program for
37:07 - a living and so you know you should you
37:09 - should be wary of me in that sense like
37:11 - I am here as hopefully somebody who can
37:16 - uh help share knowledge with you help
37:19 - inspire you maybe uh you know dare I say
37:21 - entertain you you know I understand that
37:24 - you that there is quite probably a large
37:27 - category of people who are not
37:29 - entertained by me at all but it's
37:32 - possible I know that that small some
37:33 - people are maybe a little bit so um but
37:36 - I would say my my if I were to
37:39 - characterize my full-time job well so I
37:41 - do have a full-time salary job which is
37:43 - what I get paid to do and YouTube is not
37:45 - that I do derive revenue from the coding
37:48 - train work for sure but my full-time day
37:52 - job I am on sabbatical right now from
37:54 - that I will be I'm going back to
37:56 - teaching in January is at New York
37:57 - University so there is a graduate
37:59 - program an undergraduate program in
38:01 - interactive media uh ITP and IMA and I
38:04 - teach classes there this is how I
38:06 - started doing all this I was making
38:07 - videos for my classes then I posted the
38:09 - videos online then I started live
38:10 - streaming then I started making videos
38:11 - that don't have to do with my classes I
38:13 - got to get back to making videos that
38:14 - I'm doing my classes so it's all kind of
38:16 - a big mess
38:17 - um but that is my full-time job uh you
38:21 - know the higher education system in the
38:23 - United States is
38:25 - broken in so many ways so I I don't
38:29 - you know make I don't want to make any
38:30 - bones it's not the right expression
38:32 - about uh you know the complexity and
38:36 - opportunity that is that only some
38:38 - people and privilege that some people
38:39 - have to be able to attend a school like
38:41 - NYU in terms of the expense and the cost
38:44 - and the
38:45 - um you know the location and all of that
38:47 - but if you are somebody who's applying
38:50 - to college or graduate school you're
38:52 - certainly welcome to check out ITP IMA
38:55 - and and uh you know ask me a question on
38:57 - social media or email the department who
39:00 - can forward them you can find my email
39:01 - online I'm just very bad I don't want to
39:04 - I'm answering my email uh I know where
39:06 - I'm going with this I'm just saying you
39:08 - know hey uh
39:11 - itp.nyu.edu let's
39:13 - see
39:15 - what's happening with the codingtrain
39:18 - website being built
39:20 - so I'm I'm logging into my netlify
39:23 - account right now
39:25 - um just to take a look at that
39:28 - let's log in with GitHub I I just moved
39:31 - my screen away so you couldn't see it uh
39:34 - okay deploy preview production
39:37 - okay so let's take a look at this so I
39:40 - think I could show this to you with no
39:41 - problem
39:44 - hmm
39:45 - I'll show you what the mess that I'm
39:47 - looking at now this is a deployment log
39:49 - I don't know why this is happening I
39:51 - mean I sort of do but um
39:54 - the logs are really just complaining
39:56 - about how long it's taking and they're
39:58 - complaining a lot
40:01 - what are the stickers on the laptop is a
40:03 - great question
40:05 - which is in the chat not in the Q a
40:06 - fascinating
40:08 - I wanted to look and see why can't I
40:10 - scroll to the top of this thing why
40:12 - can't I the deploy log is I mean let's
40:15 - look at the side 405 of these numbers
40:17 - going down yes they are
40:19 - at some point we're gonna get to the top
40:21 - this is insane there we go deploy log
40:24 - netlifies robots are busy building and
40:27 - deploying your site
40:28 - today at 10 12 A.M
40:30 - and it's just taking a very long time uh
40:34 - we can see the sort of build logs and
40:37 - this
40:38 - is where I think it's just giving me the
40:42 - same warning over and over again because
40:44 - this is not a new 14 seconds every time
40:48 - unless it's building a lot of pages in
40:49 - parallel and a whole lot of warnings are
40:51 - coming out anybody has any
40:54 - Gatsby graphql netlify expertise and
40:59 - knowledge who wants to help me
41:00 - understand what's going on here I'd be
41:03 - uh certainly glad to um
41:06 - glad glad for your
41:08 - um contribution all right so stickers
41:12 - um this is processing processing is the
41:15 - creative coding Java development
41:16 - environment that I started with in my
41:19 - teaching work I would say uh back in
41:21 - 2003
41:23 - uh
41:28 - uh processing the stickers for
41:30 - processing three there are newer
41:31 - processing stickers P5 is the JavaScript
41:35 - um p5.js JavaScript reimagination of
41:37 - processing they both are part of the
41:39 - processing Foundation processing
41:41 - Community Day where this is the sticker
41:42 - for an event in Los Angeles and many
41:45 - years ago these are this is the coding
41:47 - train this dot character coding training
41:49 - ml5 is a machine learning library Gotham
41:52 - girls junior Derby so roller derby you
41:55 - can't see that can you
41:56 - um
41:57 - Roller Derby uh group that my daughter
42:00 - was involved with for a brief period of
42:02 - time
42:05 - Gloria pickle
42:07 - my dog whoops coding rainbow
42:10 - if you know what coding rainbow is then
42:12 - if you know you know that's the thing
42:13 - you say uh rise in code hi hello there
42:16 - is uh Jason haglin's an art business I
42:20 - don't know what to call it find Jason
42:21 - hagland and hi hello there on Instagram
42:23 - makes wonderful art and stickers so most
42:26 - of these are all coding train stickers
42:27 - actually never forget this dot I'll
42:29 - refactor that later you can get you can
42:31 - buy these or you can sign up to be a
42:33 - coding trained member and I will send
42:35 - you a sticker pack I won't send it to
42:37 - you personally but Jason who makes all
42:39 - these stickers will send it to you okay
42:43 - I wanted the redirect to work
42:46 - is it still deploying
42:49 - we'll come back to that
42:50 - all right so let me talk to you about my
42:53 - two
42:56 - um
42:57 - Sans music don't worry you can watch
42:59 - this back later you can watch it back at
43:00 - 2x thank you coding Garden for posting
43:03 - links in the chat to various things that
43:06 - I'm talking about
43:12 - do you guys hear that
43:17 - there's a crackling noise
43:22 - what is that
43:24 - let me mute is it just some weird
43:26 - you guys don't hear any weird audio
43:28 - feedback or anything
43:30 - oh you know what I don't know what it is
43:32 - but it's coming out of that monitor
43:34 - and I'm going to assume as long as it's
43:36 - not being broadcast I can mute that
43:39 - monitor
43:41 - uh Marius asked will there ever be a
43:43 - video on the you are bot please keep
43:46 - asking me that question right now I'm
43:48 - kind of waiting um you know I'm a huge
43:51 - fan of the television program called
43:54 - Severance and I made a whole sort of
43:57 - version of the macro data refinement
43:59 - which is this computer program that runs
44:01 - in the TV show and I want to risk
44:03 - spoiling anything go and watch it if you
44:05 - are able to and haven't already
44:07 - um I made a bot about one of the
44:09 - characters in the show so I want to get
44:12 - I want to make a lot of content about
44:13 - the show and those projects but I think
44:16 - I'm gonna wait until
44:19 - um I know when the season 2 premiere
44:22 - date is and then try to make that
44:23 - content in the lead up to it so Marius
44:26 - I I don't know where you are and where
44:28 - you'll be many months from now but keep
44:30 - on asking me that question because it's
44:32 - coming
44:34 - um
44:35 - uh okay so let me start talking to you
44:38 - about
44:40 - um the Apple II
44:42 - because this is going to lead us to the
44:45 - project that I want to start today
44:51 - just curious is this
44:53 - ever going to turn on no I wonder if
44:55 - there's just something wrong with this
44:56 - iPad no all right
44:59 - probably shouldn't ask for your what I
45:02 - think I need to do
45:05 - is I need to take this iPad
45:07 - and I need to just plug it into its own
45:09 - and maybe this charging cable is no good
45:13 - if we're going to have any chance
45:15 - of any uh sound
45:18 - I need to find
45:20 - I have a plug
45:23 - I have a a
45:25 - um what do you call this a lightning
45:27 - cable
45:28 - this is not plug I'm going to plug it
45:31 - into here
45:33 - I'm plugging it into its own power
45:35 - source
45:37 - over where you can't see
45:39 - and that's why I will just check it in a
45:41 - little while
45:44 - it's plugged in it's charging I will
45:46 - come back to it okay
45:52 - so the Apple II the Apple II uh computer
45:56 - was my childhood computer
46:01 - um and I have always wanted to revisit
46:05 - it
46:06 - and when my parents recently uh moved I
46:10 - was helping clean out the attic and
46:12 - found I mean I knew it was there and
46:15 - this was always the plans it wasn't like
46:16 - oh this like amazing Discovery as I
46:18 - Unearthed it but um I was able to take
46:22 - home with me the
46:25 - um that Apple 2 plus computer now I
46:27 - there was a live stream you can find it
46:29 - where I turned it on for the very first
46:30 - time since probably in close to 40 years
46:34 - somewhere maybe 30 35 years
46:37 - um and if you go back and find that live
46:38 - stream
46:39 - uh it's working and it runs I'm loading
46:41 - disks and doing all sorts of stuff with
46:43 - it and then at some point during the
46:45 - live stream it starts to crackle and
46:46 - make a sound and this is a very common
46:49 - thing that happens I'm gonna go grab it
46:50 - right now
46:52 - um the old Apple II power supplies I
46:56 - learned the capacitors in them they have
46:58 - a certain name for them the rifa
47:00 - capacitors maybe if you if they sit for
47:03 - a long time this is the actual power
47:04 - supply they start to they get they fry
47:07 - they burst they crackle they smoke up it
47:10 - made it was a horrible smell smoke
47:12 - coming out of it so I was very concerned
47:14 - and I thought all was lost the good news
47:17 - is this is an easy-ish thing to replace
47:22 - um if I was a bit more comfortable with
47:25 - hardware and I guess I can switch over
47:27 - to this view so you can maybe see it a
47:29 - little bit better if I was a bit more
47:32 - attuned to working with a uh electronics
47:36 - parts and hardware and soldering this
47:39 - one could probably be easily restored I
47:41 - was even told by someone who that's like
47:43 - it doesn't even matter just pull those
47:44 - out use it anyway
47:46 - um but what I did instead is I ordered a
47:51 - kit from my reactive micro which is a
47:55 - sort of like modern rebuild of the Apple
47:57 - II power supply and I hooked that up
48:00 - with the Apple II and uh it was working
48:02 - again
48:03 - then I had some other issues and I won't
48:05 - go through all the different steps But
48:07 - ultimately the Apple II that I'm using
48:10 - right now is mostly put together from
48:13 - parts that I bought off eBay
48:15 - so the monitor is original the disk
48:19 - drives uh even the
48:21 - um I had to get a a new case there's a
48:25 - different keyboard now so you know for
48:28 - me to say it's my childhood computer
48:30 - it's like it's the ship of Theseus you
48:33 - know if I'm swapping Parts in and out of
48:36 - it eventually if I swap every single
48:37 - part I'm totally butchering the tail of
48:40 - the the
48:41 - the the ship of Theseus
48:44 - um uh metaphor here but um you know is
48:46 - it really my childhood computer not
48:48 - really but enough of it is and the
48:51 - spirit of it is there so
48:53 - um I've been I've now made three videos
48:56 - with the Apple II
48:59 - um which you can find on YouTube
49:01 - um all of the source code for those
49:04 - videos is here uh the Oh no you're not
49:07 - seeing this
49:08 - um I made a snake game a fractal tree
49:11 - and most recently this 3D cube so for
49:15 - example if I go in here
49:16 - um you know I made it did a few things
49:18 - in this video I can
49:20 - um
49:22 - I can look at the code and one of the
49:24 - things you can do is you can find this
49:27 - basic code that I write in the video and
49:28 - I'm sorry that this coffee mug which
49:31 - should be over here is blocking things I
49:33 - can paste this I can take this
49:37 - um
49:37 - Apple to JavaScript emulator
49:42 - there are two that I like to use
49:47 - there is this emulator which I will get
49:49 - to in a second and then there's this
49:50 - emulator
49:52 - so this is not a true this one is not
49:55 - what you might call a true emulator it's
49:58 - not emulating the
50:00 - Apple II hardware and processor itself
50:06 - it's just converting the basic code into
50:09 - JavaScript which allows it to run so
50:12 - much faster so this is the actual basic
50:15 - code that I write in the video that
50:17 - renders and rotates this spinning Cube
50:21 - I can take that code and go over to this
50:23 - which is a true emulator and I'm going
50:26 - to uh hit reset here so I can get to a
50:29 - Dos commit prompt
50:31 - um I know do you say DOS prompt with the
50:34 - Apple II Apple II prompt I'm going to
50:36 - paste in the code so you can actually
50:39 - paste in this emulator which is great
50:40 - because it's like as if I'm typing in
50:42 - all these line numbers
50:49 - um so this will take a little bit and
50:52 - then now I can uh well oops I can run
50:57 - this code in this emulator and you will
51:00 - see it
51:03 - uh appearing momentarily
51:06 - and uh here it is it is running
51:08 - incredibly slow so one of the things
51:10 - that I address in the video is how could
51:14 - this be optimized and this is something
51:16 - that I would love to go quickly and look
51:19 - at some of the comments because there
51:20 - were some great suggestions and so far I
51:22 - haven't seen anybody try any of these
51:24 - you know maybe not everyone just has all
51:27 - the Time in the World to Tinker around
51:29 - with applesauce basic Watcher coded
51:32 - Trend video let me spend all day see if
51:33 - I can optimize this you know 40 year old
51:35 - uh code base system but um let's take a
51:39 - look at the the comments briefly for
51:41 - this video and see what we can find out
51:44 - um so I'm going to go over to videos
51:47 - um I'm going to go to this uh coding
51:49 - challenge episode of coding together and
51:51 - I'm gonna mute it
51:54 - um and let's let's take a look okay so
51:57 - um
51:59 - whoops I wanted to see the comments a
52:01 - little bit bigger
52:02 - so let's take a look at this one uh you
52:04 - should do all the multiply and divide
52:07 - using bit shift and Edition use a lookup
52:10 - table for sine and cosine so one of the
52:12 - things I absolutely don't bother to
52:14 - worry about and we can go back to my
52:16 - code to see
52:19 - is
52:21 - you know uh so there's a lot of
52:23 - multiplication and one of the things
52:24 - that's really absurd that I'm doing is
52:27 - in my effort to uh explain all of the
52:30 - math and the way that I'm used to doing
52:33 - things now as a teacher I want things to
52:35 - be very explicit and readable and I
52:38 - don't mind having longer code that is
52:40 - less efficient if it's more
52:42 - understandable and relatable and so I
52:45 - have a lot of multiply by zero which is
52:48 - just absolutely a waste of computation
52:52 - because
52:54 - we all know what multiplied by zero is
52:56 - but in my head I'm leading up to the
52:57 - point where the rotation matrices might
52:59 - not always have a zero in them and that
53:01 - could be a variable so I need it in
53:03 - there but even so this is interesting
53:05 - for this comment to address
53:08 - um
53:09 - could I actually use bitshift and
53:12 - addition to execute multiplication
53:15 - operations and that would be faster
53:17 - lookup table for sine and cosine This
53:20 - was
53:21 - um
53:22 - this was the most commonly and I did
53:24 - mention it in the video suggested uh fix
53:27 - like one of the things that I do is I
53:30 - there is a loop here that I have to do
53:33 - these mathematical operations
53:36 - um
53:37 - it's interesting that the ace Magpie by
53:39 - the way right the Apple 2 videos are how
53:41 - I started watching so uh I'd be curious
53:43 - to see like are you interested in the
53:45 - you know literally a thousand other
53:46 - videos on the channel that have nothing
53:48 - to do with the Apple too
53:50 - um so I have this Loop that I'm doing
53:51 - eight times where
53:54 - um
53:56 - so if I had the sine operation and the
53:58 - cosine operation right here in the code
54:00 - I would have to be executing those
54:02 - mathematical operations eight times
54:04 - which I know would be very very
54:06 - inefficient so at least I'm calculating
54:09 - and my finger won't go up that high but
54:11 - at least I'm calculating them uh once
54:14 - before the loop up here and then but
54:17 - what if but this is still happening
54:20 - every frame so what if at the beginning
54:24 - we built a large array do we have enough
54:27 - RAM and this is a consideration when you
54:30 - only have you know 48k of ram that's 48
54:34 - kilobytes not 48
54:36 - megabytes certainly not 48 gigabytes 48
54:40 - kilobytes of ram could I make an array
54:44 - that has 360 elements in it maybe one
54:48 - calculation for every degree of rotation
54:50 - I don't know
54:51 - um and then look up the calculated
54:53 - values from that array that would
54:54 - certainly improve things
54:56 - let's see if we can find a couple other
54:58 - comments my goal for these live streams
54:59 - is to curate these in advance but I
55:03 - um
55:03 - I love that he shows us his mistakes
55:05 - it's great to hear uh thanks coding
55:08 - Adventures everyone check out the coding
55:09 - Adventures YouTube channel
55:12 - um increasing performance okay
55:15 - excluding reprogramming and assembly so
55:17 - programming in Assembly Language I have
55:19 - the 6502 book uh I might like to
55:22 - investigate that pre-computed Sign Co
55:23 - values deleting the entire HDR buffer on
55:26 - every frame takes a lot of time
55:28 - this cannot be done during vsync as
55:31 - someone suggested not even let's go the
55:32 - filling of the 4K bank with zero takes
55:34 - almost one second probably the largest
55:36 - contributor lack of performance
55:38 - redraw the existing lines in Black just
55:41 - keep two arrays and flip among them as
55:44 - you draw each page so you have always
55:46 - have access to the previous points and
55:48 - Alternate the rotate subroutine to use
55:51 - either one this is so great I don't know
55:53 - if you're following this but this is
55:56 - exactly what I need to do there's a
55:59 - shape table functionality so there's a
56:01 - lot there's a lot here everybody read
56:02 - Nelson's comments but really I think
56:05 - this is the answer and I'll I'll show
56:08 - you whoops I'm in the wrong place so
56:10 - what is what is Nelson suggesting
56:13 - so I am storing
56:17 - um
56:18 - sorry I am calculating let me look let
56:21 - me look back up ultimately these are the
56:25 - points that I am drawing
56:27 - I'm drawing everything from this array
56:30 - projected those are the final rotated
56:33 - and projected points of the cube into 3D
56:36 - I'm storing them into two pairs of X Y
56:39 - coordinates and drawing a line that is
56:41 - white
56:43 - before that happens right before that
56:46 - happens at the beginning I call this
56:49 - memory address which wipes the high
56:51 - resolution Graphics buffer and in my
56:53 - mind that's like the easiest thing in
56:55 - the world to do right I haven't like
56:58 - it's literally just 280 by 192 pixels
57:00 - just wipe the whole thing that's like
57:02 - the fastest operation computers do now
57:04 - but
57:06 - it's actually it's got to take every
57:07 - pixel I guess even the ones that are
57:09 - already black and turn them to Black
57:10 - it's very very slow uh and also the the
57:14 - the the refresh rate of the Monitor and
57:16 - everything gets in the way apparently so
57:19 - um
57:21 - um so the idea here would be for me to
57:24 - essentially duplicate this every line
57:27 - that I draw before I draw it I erase the
57:30 - previous one with H Color equals zero
57:32 - which is black so instead of wiping 280
57:35 - times 192 pixels I'm only wiping the
57:38 - necessary pixels so I would need an
57:40 - additional array to store the previous
57:42 - locations uh and then an additional call
57:44 - to this it would be a lot the reason I
57:47 - didn't do it is it's a lot more code and
57:50 - a lot more work I do this in one thing
57:53 - you can see however if you're interested
57:55 - if I go back
57:57 - um
57:59 - I think is it did I upload it yes
58:04 - so this particular example does that
58:07 - so this particular example is just
58:09 - drawing a line I'll show you what it
58:11 - does
58:14 - oops I can't seem to get to the right
58:16 - place
58:18 - um
58:19 - Ctrl C
58:23 - text
58:24 - new
58:31 - so this little simple program
58:34 - which is just drawing a line and by the
58:36 - way oh there's a whole other totally
58:37 - insane thing going on because that
58:39 - Line's supposed to be white
58:41 - I don't have time I mean
58:44 - I have to move on at some point for my
58:46 - random digressions but um
58:49 - but this uh Bill oh yeah var19 the idea
58:53 - of building the Matrix outside of the
58:54 - loop is another great one
58:57 - um that uh a var19 if you're
59:00 - the same person who suggested this maybe
59:03 - in a in a pull request
59:05 - was there a pull request or issue let's
59:07 - find it
59:09 - um
59:11 - yeah rotation
59:13 - uh
59:14 - so this is an example uh
59:18 - so okay
59:21 - um I don't know if this is the same
59:22 - thing you're suggesting and Oscar had an
59:25 - apple 2C that had 128k of ram
59:28 - um so this idea of constructing the
59:32 - rotation Matrix just once before the
59:34 - draw loop with an angle of one degree
59:36 - then use that same Matrix every time to
59:39 - transform the current coordinates you
59:40 - know what only now that this suddenly
59:42 - make sense to me so I'm I'm assuming
59:45 - always a cube that is uh with no
59:50 - rotation
59:53 - and so what I do is I calculate the
59:55 - rotation Matrix to rotate it by one
59:56 - degree then the next time no rotation
59:58 - two degrees then the next time no
60:01 - rotation three degrees what var19 in the
60:05 - uh chat is suggesting is rotate it by
60:07 - one degree and I already have that
60:08 - calculated one degree rotation Matrix so
60:10 - apply that to the one degree rotated one
60:12 - and that would certainly I think help
60:15 - quite a bit
60:17 - um so um I I would welcome pull requests
60:21 - with these improvements if you are to do
60:25 - a pull request with the Improvement what
60:27 - I would suggest is
60:32 - um add a new file this is the wrong
60:35 - place
60:37 - add a new file
60:40 - uh instead of editing one of mine
60:43 - because I would like mine to remain the
60:45 - same exactly what I did in the coding
60:48 - demonstrations themselves okay
60:50 - I've got about an hour left I I don't
60:53 - know how I managed to continue to do
60:54 - this I hope that people enjoy these live
60:57 - streams even when there's I don't even
60:59 - know where I'm going or what I'm doing
61:00 - with things but I think it's time it's
61:02 - time to talk about the main event for
61:04 - today
61:05 - and
61:08 - I kind of want to know I'm I'm I'm I
61:10 - haven't taken a moment to stop talking I
61:12 - think for the last half an hour or so
61:14 - and I can start to feel it we take a few
61:16 - deep breaths here
61:19 - let's see if the coding Train website
61:21 - has rebuilt
61:25 - can I go
61:26 - I don't uh
61:28 - um complete it
61:30 - okay so if everything goes according to
61:32 - plan if I go to the codingtrain.com choo
61:35 - choo
61:37 - great okay so now I can talk about what
61:42 - I want to talk about so uh apologies the
61:45 - the link in the top right is technically
61:47 - incorrect but I now have it redirect to
61:49 - the correct link which is
61:50 - curiositystream.com choo choo which is
61:52 - the link that you'll find in this
61:53 - video's description
61:54 - so
61:56 - um before I made any of those apple II
61:58 - videos I had the chance to work with uh
62:02 - uh the streaming company nebula which I
62:04 - am a part of the
62:06 - it's owned by creators and created by
62:08 - creators one of which is me
62:11 - um nebula if I go to nebula.tv what is
62:14 - code
62:18 - um you will see
62:19 - that I have this course on the website
62:24 - called uh what is code and let me make
62:27 - it a little bit bigger
62:30 - and I guess I don't want to make it that
62:32 - and it is essentially it's for the total
62:35 - beginner so I'm not 100 sure I think
62:38 - that I mean it's my goal that anybody
62:40 - from Total beginner to experience
62:42 - programmer alike
62:44 - could enjoy and find this course
62:46 - interesting in terms of uh the my
62:51 - perspective on what is code and
62:53 - Computing and a bit of the history
62:55 - behind uh and context for programming
62:58 - languages in basic but this is actually
63:00 - a set of step-by-step lessons for total
63:03 - beginners that covers uh variables
63:05 - conditionals
63:09 - update the banner to be the coding train
63:12 - oh no so the banner is just a fail
63:16 - but this is all secretly me getting it
63:21 - so that you
63:24 - have to like really type it in and
63:26 - you're more inclined to I don't know
63:27 - what the four-dimensional chess game I'm
63:29 - playing with you here is but anyway this
63:31 - is a beginner course where I build the
63:34 - whole project
63:35 - and I I don't know it was a really fun
63:37 - to make
63:38 - um I think it can even like just play
63:40 - the introduction here uh the production
63:41 - quality is better than anything I have
63:45 - ever
63:46 - uh done myself and I just want to thank
63:49 - nebula and the nebula team for
63:51 - collaborating with me on this so
63:53 - hello welcome oh hi so excited you are
63:57 - okay my name is Dan that's weird all
63:59 - right this is weird 20 years teaching
64:00 - coding okay yeah yeah yeah 20 blah blah
64:03 - blah blah coding coding coding teacher
64:04 - teaching I've heard it all before
64:07 - um so the reason why I'm mentioning all
64:09 - of this is because today's the sponsor
64:12 - actually of the coding train is
64:14 - curiosity stream
64:16 - oh
64:18 - wait I have a fun idea uh add
64:25 - image text okay uh text
64:30 - uh the
64:33 - uh the
64:35 - okay
64:36 - uh the
64:38 - uh okay
64:40 - uh
64:46 - this is a professional operation people
64:51 - laughs
64:53 - oh yeah yeah you would never know
64:57 - you never know that that was wrong okay
65:01 - um the reason why I'm mentioning all
65:02 - this is because
65:04 - um curiosity stream uh is
65:10 - a streaming service with an incredible
65:12 - library of documentaries
65:14 - um Dr Hannah Frye has some wonderful
65:17 - documentaries about math maths so if you
65:20 - like math and science and if you like
65:22 - biology and animals and
65:25 - climate science and all sorts of stuff
65:28 - curiosity stream is like one of my
65:30 - favorite streaming services like if I'm
65:31 - just sitting around and being like what
65:33 - what kind of interesting uh uh math and
65:37 - science uh related documentary do I want
65:39 - to relax to you this evening uh there's
65:41 - just literally thousands of
65:42 - documentaries and with the coding trains
65:45 - um uh coupon code choo choo you can get
65:48 - access to all of curiosity stream for
65:51 - 14.79 for the entire year and what is
65:54 - totally new is previously as of like a
65:58 - week ago the nebula class what is code
66:01 - was a separate purchase uh somewhere in
66:04 - the 100 range uh to to view nebula
66:08 - classes but now
66:11 - with uh the Curiosity stream bundle
66:14 - which comes with nebula right the
66:16 - Curiosity stream bundle comes with all
66:19 - of nebula
66:21 - so everything that's on nebula
66:23 - um
66:24 - um and uh my favorite thing on nebula is
66:28 - uh let's just look for it I am like
66:31 - obsessed with this show jet lag the game
66:35 - so uh if you like travel and competition
66:39 - shows and like crazy weird challenges in
66:43 - for Far Away foreign places uh you will
66:46 - uh we will not be able to resist this
66:48 - show I'm so obsessed with it and I know
66:50 - they just filmed a new season of it uh
66:52 - my kids love watching it Mike I've been
66:54 - watching this with my daughter and we're
66:55 - like the biggest nebula fans I just have
66:57 - one thing to say to all of you which is
66:58 - team Ben
67:00 - I will go no further than that
67:02 - um but so if you sign up for the
67:04 - Curiosity stream bundle which is like
67:06 - less than 15 for the whole year you also
67:08 - get access to all of nebula and
67:11 - nebula classes comes with nebula if you
67:15 - sign up directly this is so confusing
67:17 - there's my price hack if you sign up for
67:19 - the bundle then you can get all of
67:22 - nebula classes for just one dollar a
67:24 - month extra so that's now the cheapest
67:26 - way to get the classes I mentioned this
67:28 - on Twitter
67:29 - um Graham's class has been really great
67:31 - for me to like learn how to do better
67:33 - audio for my stuff
67:35 - um there's some other uh Patrick
67:37 - Williams class some great music ones
67:40 - um so I encourage you to um check
67:43 - there's a really nice live streaming one
67:45 - that I don't see right now so I'm sorry
67:47 - I went on for so long about this
67:49 - um
67:50 - um so but if you like the Apple tooth my
67:52 - whole thing was if you like the Apple II
67:54 - stuff you like documentaries you're
67:56 - interested in the nebula class and all
67:58 - of nebula the cheapest way now to get it
68:01 - is through the link that is on the top
68:02 - of the screen the countrytrain.com okay
68:07 - now moving on
68:10 - um
68:12 - yes there was Tom Scott also did a video
68:14 - collaborating with the jet lag team I
68:16 - don't know I kind of like I would love
68:18 - to play the jet lag game although I
68:19 - think I might be too old that's like
68:22 - terrible at it I'd be like but what if I
68:25 - have to pee in the middle of the race
68:28 - that's literally what I would worry
68:30 - about
68:32 - that that's going to get edited out
68:34 - right we're on a tape delay right how
68:37 - long is the tape delay what no no no
68:39 - tape delay okay anyway
68:42 - um choo choo
68:44 - um my son five shows interest in
68:48 - programming any tips on a project want
68:50 - to use P5 doing together oh
68:53 - so first of all you're probably aware of
68:55 - this um this is Danny asks this in the Q
68:57 - a chat
68:59 - um
69:00 - and let me the the is always going to be
69:03 - there now let me uh
69:04 - get that out of the way
69:06 - um
69:08 - um so you're probably aware of scratch
69:10 - which is a uh block based uh coding
69:13 - environment that's great for kids my
69:15 - kids have both used it when they were
69:17 - younger uh P5 I mean there's no rules to
69:20 - this but my I would say probably P5
69:23 - makes sense to start
69:25 - um in the sort of flight well here in
69:27 - the states we would say around I would
69:28 - say around sixth grade which is
69:30 - um 11. my daughter's in sixth grade so I
69:33 - know that
69:34 - um but
69:35 - um certainly I love the idea when I when
69:38 - when my I think when my son was five and
69:40 - my daughter was like no no he was more
69:42 - like four because she was a baby we made
69:45 - a game in processing together which was
69:47 - like used a picture of her and a
69:49 - blueberry and we had to like throw
69:51 - blueberries at the baby and then if the
69:53 - blueberries hit the baby the baby would
69:54 - grow bigger somewhere on my the depths
69:57 - of my laptop is this game that I made so
69:59 - I do think
70:00 - um there's a lot of fun things you could
70:02 - do and it sort of depends on what she
70:03 - likes
70:05 - um I'm you know
70:07 - easiest for me to like sort of scroll
70:08 - through the coding challenges and see
70:10 - but um like a variation of like a game
70:13 - like this Pie in the Sky game she might
70:15 - like some of these fun like video things
70:17 - where you kind of like use the webcam
70:19 - and distort it uh slide puzzle and you
70:23 - said your son sorry I'm
70:24 - um thinking of my daughter here
70:27 - um
70:28 - slide puzzle uh could be fun with kids
70:30 - but and then and then maybe
70:33 - um any of these like algorithmic ones
70:35 - like the snowflakes so you know poke
70:38 - through these see if any of these
70:39 - resonate with you some of them are
70:41 - obviously more complex than others so
70:43 - you might look at the code and see how
70:44 - like you know how much code there is
70:48 - um but um yeah there's a lot there's a
70:50 - you know I haven't really been making
70:51 - these and the last three have been Apple
70:52 - II Plus
70:54 - so uh but they're you know there are 175
70:57 - of them so even though I've slowed down
70:59 - enormously in the last year in terms of
71:01 - these coding Challenge videos there are
71:03 - a lot okay
71:08 - um Johan says I'm canceling Disney plus
71:10 - and Netflix for this well I don't blame
71:13 - you although I I'm really excited I
71:14 - haven't watched Andor but everyone's
71:15 - telling me Andor uh is really really
71:18 - good on Disney plus and I do have a
71:19 - Disney Plus subscription so I should
71:20 - watch it okay
71:22 - let's move over so let's talk about the
71:25 - Oregon Trail so this is the beginning of
71:27 - a journey
71:28 - that we are all going to go on together
71:30 - really me and maybe you if you if you
71:33 - choose to accept
71:36 - let's go over to the Apple II plus and
71:39 - get that going
71:40 - uh
71:42 - um oh yeah I have a button
71:45 - and I have an hour before I really have
71:48 - to go so we've got an hour for this now
71:51 - I'm just looking for my Apple II button
71:53 - I made an apple II button did I forget
71:54 - to sit this one no
71:58 - where did it go
72:03 - oh here it is Oregon Trail okay so I'm
72:05 - gonna bring my secondary laptop where I
72:07 - have the chat going over with me here
72:14 - um so let me know in the chat if
72:17 - the audio is good still
72:21 - and
72:23 - I'm gonna sit here oh oh I get to sit
72:26 - down and never sit down while I'm
72:27 - streaming
72:29 - um and I'm going to go to the live chat
72:34 - and I'm going to turn the power on here
72:37 - now
72:39 - before I go anywhere before I do more
72:41 - can you see this it's of course I guess
72:43 - I could pull it around here
72:45 - it doesn't really matter this uh I
72:47 - referenced I talked about this in my
72:49 - most recent video where I talked about
72:52 - this floppy emu which is a disk drive
72:55 - emulator so essentially
72:58 - um I have an SD card which has you know
73:02 - room for a thousand floppy disks or more
73:04 - I'm making that number up I haven't done
73:06 - the math but you know this is a floppy
73:08 - disk is like 140k and this is like uh
73:12 - four gigabytes this SD card I don't know
73:15 - why I said 32 because I think I said
73:17 - that in the video but I was wrong
73:19 - um so uh what this will do is emulate
73:22 - the disk drive
73:24 - um so I'm going to turn on the monitor
73:25 - now one thing might happen right now and
73:27 - I'll be curious to know in the chat
73:30 - um
73:30 - so the monitor is on and I am 49 years
73:34 - old
73:36 - and my hearing and eyesight is atrocious
73:39 - and there's no way I'm ever going to
73:42 - hear the high-pitched wine that is
73:43 - coming from this monitor but I know for
73:46 - a fact
73:47 - that
73:49 - um when I released my first Apple II
73:52 - video many viewers could hear a very
73:55 - high pitched frequency sound going
73:57 - during the entire video and we're
73:59 - complaining
74:01 - so if is that is something you could
74:04 - hear and it's bothering you I will go
74:05 - back to OBS and try to put a low-pass
74:07 - filter on but I didn't bother to try to
74:11 - figure that out before I started
74:12 - streaming so I'm going to turn this
74:13 - computer on and hopefully and you're
74:14 - going to tell me in the chat you're
74:16 - going to see the output of this monitor
74:18 - on the blue in that blue screen that is
74:21 - empty right now that says no signal
74:27 - um now it's worrying and
74:30 - um it's loading the uh one of the disks
74:33 - that I used to
74:36 - um that I was using when
74:39 - um
74:40 - I'm sorry I'm like uh I lost lost my
74:43 - train of thought uh that should be the
74:45 - other one of the other coding train
74:46 - sayings
74:48 - um I hear it a little but it's fine says
74:50 - the zad gaming
74:53 - um
74:55 - it's loading a disk sorry so it's
74:58 - loading a disk
75:00 - and I can type catalog
75:04 - and there's a bunch of things on this
75:06 - disk this is like a DOS
75:08 - uh 3.3 sample disk
75:15 - um and I think my Vandal brought program
75:18 - is on this one yeah that's what I was
75:20 - using this for so if I load
75:24 - the mandelbrot program in basic I can
75:27 - look at the code
75:30 - and you can see this is the code oh this
75:32 - is not the final code
75:34 - this is one I wonder which one this is
75:37 - this is not the final code that I wrote
75:39 - for
75:40 - um
75:41 - I don't think yeah this is one it's good
75:43 - this is one I did a couple different
75:45 - ones this is one that's drawing a random
75:47 - Dot and coloring it according to the
75:50 - Mandel brought set I can't see it at all
75:54 - you can definitely hear it says bon bon
75:58 - um
75:58 - Let's uh so I'm curious does do you see
76:01 - I don't see on this monitor I don't see
76:03 - any color I should probably hook my
76:05 - phone up to OBS so I can have a roaming
76:07 - camera here because you probably can't
76:09 - really see what's on this monitor
76:10 - obviously you can see the output of it
76:11 - you're sort of seeing the from the side
76:15 - um but is this are are we using
76:16 - different colored dots that if they kept
76:18 - going would maybe make the mandelbot set
76:25 - not too disturbing that okay
76:27 - I mean I kind of wanted but the dogs are
76:30 - going great is Ness is that for real
76:32 - Ness writes I can't hear it but the dogs
76:33 - are going crazy
76:36 - um
76:37 - okay
76:39 - um
76:40 - I I got I gotta yes we see colorful dots
76:43 - so I would love to let this run for a
76:45 - while but we won't get anywhere if we do
76:46 - so
76:51 - um let's see what else is on this whoops
76:55 - let's see what else is on this disc
76:58 - Apple Vision animals oh into basic FB
77:02 - basic
77:03 - color test Breakout
77:07 - let's try brick out
77:18 - come on brick out you can load
77:21 - by the way did you know
77:23 - see if I can find it
77:30 - did you know that um when I first got
77:33 - the Apple II plus I would load games off
77:35 - of a cassette tape so I had literally a
77:38 - cassette tape not a disk drive
77:40 - and this is one of those original
77:42 - cassette tapes I have no way of
77:43 - accessing the data on it it says micro
77:46 - computer games 1980 a division of the
77:48 - Avalon Hill Gameco
77:51 - I don't I should probably set the camera
77:52 - to autofocus and then I could put this
77:55 - up real close but the focus is locked
77:56 - right now on the Apple II computer
78:01 - um but this is pretty wild Planet miners
78:06 - because maybe this game programs trs80
78:09 - Apple II
78:16 - okay so oh I loaded brick out one of the
78:19 - things that's wonderful I mean this is
78:20 - just not the case for computers today
78:22 - it's like oh I want to play the Breakout
78:23 - game I got it on this disc I can look at
78:26 - all of the source code for Brick out
78:28 - like this is all of the source code for
78:30 - the Breakout game
78:32 - and I could just edit it right here so
78:35 - loading the game is not loading some
78:38 - binary executable compiled file that's
78:41 - proprietary that's going to have in-app
78:43 - purchases and all that nonsense
78:45 - it's literally oh
78:47 - I don't know what just happened there
78:51 - uh
78:52 - cassette tapes were the norm in Europe
78:54 - floppy disks were mostly a us thing
78:56 - that's interesting from Stig
78:58 - um what songs so I don't know what just
79:00 - happened here I think it crashed
79:04 - I'm hoping I I guess I'm gonna
79:07 - um
79:07 - well I was gonna play brick out but
79:10 - let's move on to the Oregon Trail
79:14 - so what I need to do on the floppy emo
79:16 - and I'm sorry that you can't see this if
79:17 - you watch my video I show close-ups of
79:19 - how this works is I am going to use
79:22 - there's a little tiny screen on this
79:24 - and I am going to
79:26 - navigate
79:28 - to find
79:29 - the Oregon Trail
79:32 - okay so I'm getting some comments about
79:34 - the high pitched noise so I'm gonna go
79:36 - work on that uh in a in a moment thank
79:40 - you for your comment
79:42 - where is Oregon Trail
79:45 - Frogger Moon Patrol Oregon Trail one
79:47 - organ Trail two
79:50 - so
79:52 - um while this loads I'm gonna
79:55 - restart the computer
79:59 - and I'm going to load the Oregon Trail
80:01 - game
80:03 - uh if anybody knows how to apply
80:08 - a low pass filter in obs
80:11 - put that information in the chat
80:14 - I'm assuming this is just taking a while
80:15 - to load
80:22 - um Johan asks about the Apple II I kind
80:24 - of talked about that earlier in the live
80:26 - stream but the short answer is yes this
80:28 - is my childhood Apple II plus computer
80:31 - so I'm over here by the you won't
80:34 - probably hear the high-pitched sound
80:35 - anymore because I've moved
80:37 - um but I'm going to look under the mic
80:39 - and I'm going to go to filters and I'm
80:42 - going to add a compressor expander game
80:46 - noise suppression Noise Gate which one
80:49 - do I do
80:51 - does anybody know
80:54 - I could Google this uh OBS low pass
80:57 - filter
81:00 - uh
81:04 - low pass
81:06 - VST plug-in
81:21 - uh
81:28 - oh yeah btb
81:30 - um use the equalizer says slog sorry
81:32 - there's there's a this whole spam scam
81:36 - issue going on on YouTube there's a lot
81:38 - of uh impersonation of the coding train
81:40 - and if I will never
81:44 - um I will never uh be saying to contact
81:48 - me on telegram because you won something
81:50 - so it's not me
81:52 - um okay so I'm going to this we're going
81:55 - to learn how to do this uh filters
81:57 - and let's try
82:00 - uh vsd 2.x plugin
82:04 - please select a plugin
82:07 - I don't have any of those okay uh
82:10 - gain expander compressor Noise Gate
82:13 - noise suppression
82:17 - uh no
82:21 - so I have to install something
82:24 - there's no EQ natively oh there isn't
82:28 - I just assumed this was like an easy
82:30 - thing for me to do
82:31 - so I might not be able to do this so
82:34 - easily
82:35 - uh
82:38 - add I see compressor expander gain
82:41 - invert polarity limiter wouldn't the
82:44 - limiter maybe work Noise Gate noise
82:46 - suppression
82:48 - limiter
82:50 - threshold
82:53 - no that's release the limiter is going
82:56 - to make it so that I can't yell and have
82:59 - distorted sound
83:01 - noise suppression will work
83:05 - all right we'll try that
83:07 - I also have
83:09 - well now you can't hear it because I I'm
83:11 - like a good 15 to 20 feet away from the
83:15 - Apple II it's a big room
83:17 - uh so I think if I go sit next to it
83:21 - yeah I know you want to hear the
83:23 - keyboard
83:25 - um
83:25 - well I don't mind installing a plug-in
83:29 - all right let's try the noise
83:30 - suppression
83:32 - and see what happens
83:36 - the noise suppression is now on
83:43 - um so I just turned noise suppression on
83:46 - and I'm going back I don't know why
83:49 - the Oregon Trail never loaded
83:57 - okay
83:58 - um
84:01 - claims to be reading from the disk still
84:03 - but do I need to like
84:07 - put in disk 2 now
84:09 - I swear I I did this earlier
84:30 - please insert side one of your organs
84:32 - discount okay
84:36 - let's see if this works
84:38 - uh
84:43 - I it's funny there must I must have it
84:45 - on a different disk
84:47 - because I swear I was I was running this
84:51 - all right so now we're loading disk one
84:53 - maybe it's going to tell ah there we go
84:56 - I knew that this worked okay
84:59 - it's worse now I can hear static
85:03 - I do have the Nvidia broadcast noise
85:05 - suppression all right I should add that
85:07 - that's what I should use
85:10 - I it's funny I have the and it is so
85:13 - hold on let me
85:15 - um let me fix this
85:22 - filters let me get rid of all these
85:24 - filters
85:27 - I totally forgot that I'm running Nvidia
85:29 - broadcast
85:34 - so I'm going to go to Nvidia broadcast
85:50 - and
85:53 - um noise
86:01 - level is now on
86:04 - the sad thing about this is I think it's
86:06 - going to cut out
86:08 - sound from the game but um Okay so
86:12 - what I would like to do as a project is
86:16 - I want to build a custom version of this
86:20 - game
86:22 - um
86:24 - and that is maybe coding train themed
86:28 - and also I have volunteered to create a
86:31 - version of this game for a podcast
86:33 - that's called renap Rob and Akiva need a
86:37 - podcast I'm sure the the crossover
86:40 - between coding trained viewers and renap
86:42 - listeners is you know uh the Venn
86:45 - diagram there is exactly one person in
86:47 - me the volume got a bit loud
86:51 - um
86:52 - so i i people people are telling me
86:55 - about the audio now but
86:57 - um so I'm trying to decide what to do I
87:00 - want to be able to have a way of making
87:02 - essentially like an Oregon Trail game
87:06 - the engine for the game that maybe
87:09 - there's like a Json file that has all
87:11 - the scripted data in it so as much as I
87:14 - would love to like do a video where I
87:16 - sort of like build and program this game
87:18 - in uh applesauce basic I think I just
87:22 - want to understand and look at the basic
87:24 - code for this game and then make a p5.js
87:26 - version of it
87:29 - um
87:31 - so
87:33 - um so let's try the game for a little
87:35 - bit so uh should we learn about the
87:38 - trail should we see the Oregon top 10
87:41 - um should we just jump on in let's Jump
87:44 - On In and travel the trail
87:51 - okay many kinds of people made the trip
87:53 - to Oregon you may be a banker from
87:55 - Boston a carpenter from Ohio a farmer
87:58 - from Illinois
87:59 - find out the difference between these
88:01 - choices let's find out the difference
88:06 - you're a banker you have more money for
88:07 - supplies
88:09 - uh farmer of the greatest number of
88:11 - points Banker earns the least
88:16 - be a banker from Boston and Carpenter oh
88:18 - I'm back here
88:20 - what do we think anybody got a uh
88:26 - anybody got a version yeah I'm pretty
88:28 - sure uh yeah the sort of meme I guess
88:31 - the uh the sort of known uh thing is

100:38 - strenuous health is good rations are
100:41 - filling weather is warm let's continue
100:42 - on the trail
100:49 - you must cross the river in order to
100:51 - continue the river at this point is
100:53 - currently 625 feet across and 4.3 feet
100:57 - deep in the middle
101:00 - you may
101:01 - all right I'm gonna need help for this
101:03 - one attempt to Ford the river wagon

101:14 - well I don't mind getting more
101:15 - information
101:19 - Ford a river I was going to ask what is
101:22 - Florida River I'm glad they're
101:23 - explaining it means to pull your wagon
101:25 - across a shallow part of the river with
101:27 - the ox still attached so that would have
101:28 - been my guess I was assuming forwarding
101:30 - a river is like basically walking across
101:32 - the river
101:34 -  the wagon means to seal it
101:36 - um so that I understood that when we
101:38 - float across like a boat
101:40 - top of a flat boat belongs to someone
101:42 - else
101:43 - I mean I think we have enough money we
101:45 - should do the ferry right
101:47 - Ferry Max bitker hi Max says the ferry
101:51 - okay we're doing the ferry
101:55 - five dollars wait five days so five

108:45 - colorful on the Apple screen green this
108:48 - is a monochrome monitor it cannot show
108:50 - color and so it takes the analog video
108:54 - output and shows it
108:57 - without color and the capture card on my
109:02 - you know 2022 Windows computer can take
109:06 - color and the color signal that's going
109:09 - out is being converted into HDMI uh
109:12 - let's continue on the trail

111:32 - lengthy Orchid Trail because I have no
111:35 - idea if the emulator is gonna work with
111:38 - flipping the disc and reloading it but
111:41 - um
111:42 - that's fine if it doesn't uh because
111:45 - then we can switch over to thinking
111:46 - about how we might do this uh with P5 or
111:50 - as a browser based thing or we can maybe
111:52 - look at the code for it so I need to
111:55 - press eject disk okay
111:58 - then I need to go to
112:01 - Apple 2 stuff five and a quarter inch

114:03 - keep going
114:13 - thank you uh coding Garden for helping
114:15 - moderate the chat
114:17 - um
114:20 - lose Trail lose four days come on people
114:22 - keep going
114:24 - yes and let's keep the chat on topic and
114:26 - that topic is
114:28 - the Oregon Trail
114:31 - can we get gaming live streams on the
114:33 - Apple II that's basically what this is
114:35 - uh
114:37 - uh I don't want to look around no keep
114:40 - going
114:41 - although I love seeing all the trail
114:43 - divides here oh see the map okay
114:47 - so uh we're gonna need another poll here
114:53 - um
114:55 - start a poll I forgot what they were
114:57 - already so it's unclear to me
115:00 - what I'm looking at in terms of where I
115:02 - want to switch
115:04 - but
115:06 - uh Green River
115:10 - Green River or fort
115:13 - Bridger I guess it's a matter of do we
115:15 - want to cross a river maybe the river is
115:17 - faster but you have to deal with the
115:18 - risk of crossing the river I'm gonna go
115:20 - for the river then
115:21 - I'm putting a poll up
115:25 - I'm going to look at the map again
115:26 - because I don't actually see
115:30 - um
115:31 - they don't actually see he which is the
115:35 - like oh I see like
115:39 - it's like going directly across the
115:40 - river versus going to this fort maybe
115:43 - it's faster I don't know
115:45 - it's not really giving me a lot of
115:46 - information
115:49 - um is the pole uh 62 right now for Green
115:52 - River all right
115:54 - we don't got a lot of time so I'm going
115:55 - with the people Green River
116:05 - all right moving along
116:08 - very little water like I'm out of water

116:15 - find wild fruit I found wild fruit I
116:19 - love wild fruit
116:26 - okay
116:28 - and Green River would you like to look
116:30 - around yeah no I knew I might just want

116:34 - around
116:37 - yeah okay here we go
116:40 - what are we gonna do 400 feet of course

117:03 - oh we end this one
117:07 - uh Deanna Lim is asking I wonder what
117:10 - algorithms are for deciding whether a
117:11 - bad thing happens I'm assuming it's just
117:13 - like a random number generator
117:14 - okay we're Green River Crossing let's go
117:17 - don't get stuck in the mud

130:56 - Ninth Place
130:58 - right it's the top ten and that's the
131:00 - spot before 10. which would be nine
131:07 - um the coding train
131:11 - no no
131:16 - all right fine coding train
131:23 - horn all right would you like to make
131:25 - any changes no
131:28 - I am forever inscribed into this Oregon
131:32 - Trail top 10. now I will just now
131:34 - connect to the internet to post a tweet
131:37 - to tweet about my high score
131:41 - all right
131:43 - um by the way let's
131:46 - look at the learn about the trail try
131:48 - taking a journey cover wagon across 2000
131:50 - miles of plains ribs and mountains to
131:52 - try on the planes
131:54 - across the rivers you money might take a
131:56 - ferry you can board the river about
131:57 - supplies
131:59 - the
132:01 - all right so I think we've seen ah you
132:03 - can use these monitors you use these
132:04 - colors to adjust your monitor or
132:06 - television so this was a thing
132:09 - that you had to calibrate so the uh you
132:13 - know when you if you had one of these
132:14 - Apple twos and one of the monochrome
132:16 - monitors you could hook it up to your
132:19 - color television set and then depending
132:22 - on the dot and using the dials on the
132:25 - back of the television in fact I have a
132:27 - color monitor here
132:30 - foreign
132:32 - so we could see I think I think this one
132:34 - is a color monitor it might not be
132:37 - this is a
132:39 - Apple monitor Cupertino California model
132:43 - g099os
132:48 - um
132:50 - yeah I thought there were maybe this one
132:51 - isn't colored does it say anybody
132:53 - recognize anybody recognize this monitor
132:56 - I have another one also that was
132:59 - definitely color this one might be
133:00 - monochrome
133:03 - um somewhere around here I have uh oh
133:05 - yeah it's underneath here so there's
133:07 - definitely a color on there anyway we
133:08 - don't need to go into that but I'm just
133:09 - curious let me I have to go look I have
133:11 - to go peek because I can't see what it's
133:13 - outputting orange green blue violet oh
133:15 - yeah looks pretty good
133:19 - all right
133:21 - control s
133:23 - that's how I could have changed the
133:24 - sound
133:26 - and all right so I'm gonna uh stop now
133:31 - I'm going to turn off the monitor
133:34 - and the computer
133:36 - because it is 11.50 and I have run out
133:39 - of time so I'm going to come back to my
133:41 - regular streaming setup
133:45 - and kind of talk about what's next here
133:48 - because
133:52 - um let's see if my
133:55 - soundboard
133:57 - charged so I can play some outro music
134:02 - totally did not
134:05 - um
134:07 - totally did not
134:09 - uh all right so let me come back to here
134:12 - I don't know what's going on with
134:15 - um
134:17 - I don't know what's going on with
134:22 - that iPad that I use for sound
134:25 - um
134:28 - okay uh let me tell let me check the Q a
134:32 - uh oh no so live chat questions
134:39 - would you make river crossing a
134:41 - challenge for the player in the remake
134:43 - so I'm I'm kind of not sure what to do
134:46 - here so let me actually just go look
134:48 - really quickly I think
134:51 - in one of these emulators
134:56 - I only have a few minutes here but let's
134:59 - just check this one
135:00 - so game this emulator I think has the
135:03 - Oregon Trail game
135:06 - uh here it is okay so I'm gonna do open
135:09 - so um in this emulator
135:13 - now I can power cycle
135:17 - so if you want to do this yourself you
135:19 - could use this emulator you could sort
135:21 - of follow along with what I'm doing
135:24 - and
135:25 - um
135:30 - what is going on here
135:32 - this is a different version of it maybe
135:39 - I love this wacky animation here
135:45 - foreign
135:48 - for this
135:50 - I wanted to see if I could take a look
135:52 - at the Oregon Trail code
135:55 - um
135:56 - oh my goodness I think I'm just going to
135:58 - control C this
136:04 - let's see if we can look at the disk
136:08 - organ Trail
136:11 - it's got a lot of other things on it too
136:20 - see if I can load it
136:24 - there's a fly buzzing around me okay
136:28 - [Music]
136:29 - um
136:32 - yeah so I'm pretty sure
136:34 - we are now looking at
136:38 - the entire source code
136:41 - of the Oregon Trail game
136:45 - um not entirely sure obviously I can't
136:47 - really tell and there's a lot of Peaks
136:48 - and
136:49 - so I don't I'm a little skeptical there
136:51 - that doesn't seem like
136:55 - I don't understand where all of the data
136:58 - was coming from for the game if I run
137:00 - this
137:02 - this is like totally a different version
137:04 - of it
137:05 - [Music]
137:12 - interesting this is like a different
137:14 - version of the game
137:15 - but um
137:18 - so hold on so
137:20 - uh let's look one more place that I'm
137:23 - curious about
137:26 - um
137:27 - can't remember or if Oregon Trail is
137:29 - here
137:30 - text Adventure there's this text
137:32 - Adventure
137:35 - which is a different one
137:42 - that's fun
137:44 - um
137:46 - other
137:47 - thought I saw it here but I guess
137:52 - not
137:57 - Tech that was a text only one I really
137:59 - like the graphics one
138:10 - so this looks like
138:14 - could it be
138:19 - um
138:25 - yeah this looks like this is the text
138:27 - only one that we were just looking at
138:30 - so it's sort of interesting to see
138:32 - anyway I I don't need to sort this out
138:34 - so my question is
138:36 - how do I want to create a version of
138:39 - this in P5 and I think right now what
138:43 - I'm going to do because I literally have
138:45 - just I have negative time left because I
138:48 - really meant to leave six minutes ago is
138:51 - I'm going to create a new repo
138:55 - and I'm sure this exists already so
138:58 - there's a question in my mind of should
139:00 - I just adapt an existing code base or
139:03 - emulator
139:05 - um or should we totally rebuild build it
139:07 - from scratch but Oregon Trail
139:10 - um emulator and emulator is kind of
139:12 - wrong I'm just gonna say
139:14 - let's call it the
139:16 - I mean I think I want to make it a
139:19 - direct
139:20 - Port of exactly what I just played maybe
139:22 - you know removing some of the culturally
139:25 - insensitive Parts about it
139:27 - um or it could just like build a version
139:29 - of it that's just straight starting with
139:31 - like sort of coding train themes
139:35 - um
139:36 - the Oregon Trail so but I'm just going
139:38 - to call this repo Oregon Trail and how
139:41 - to read me and if people have some ideas
139:43 - or proposals for how to get started with
139:45 - this and you want to contribute to it I
139:47 - mean I'm going to come back and stream
139:48 - about it maybe I'll make a video about
139:49 - it
139:51 - um maybe this weekend I'll just turn on
139:52 - the streaming again uh what I would
139:54 - suggest is uh file some issues because
139:56 - if you want to participate in this file
139:59 - an issue to raise your hand to offer an
140:01 - idea I'll try to if I have time today
140:04 - start building this out in some way
140:07 - um
140:08 - and we should see
140:12 - um call it the coding Trail yes so that
140:14 - would have made sense so I but I've got
140:16 - to run
140:18 - um thank you again to
140:20 - um
140:21 - uh curiosity streams for sponsoring if
140:26 - you missed my uh if you missed my whole
140:29 - spiel about the nebula class what is
140:32 - code
140:34 - um you can uh go back to the archive of
140:37 - this and watch about it but the this is
140:39 - now
140:40 - um uh you could sign up directly but uh
140:44 - for uh um for uh nebula and you will
140:48 - have access to the nebula class but the
140:50 - price hack that I'm offering you is to
140:52 - get the Curiosity stream bundle which
140:54 - gets you curiosity stream plus nebula
140:56 - for 14.79 and then for one dollar a
140:59 - month more or five dollars for the whole
141:01 - year you have access to all of nebula
141:02 - classes
141:04 - um and um thank you coding Garden for
141:07 - for posting all these links
141:09 - um I don't know what I'm doing next I
141:12 - really gotta work on the nature of code
141:13 - book I have made a lot of progress
141:16 - but I'm behind still so that's kind of
141:20 - my reason for not streaming so much but
141:23 - I would feel better about saying that if
141:25 - I had made more progress but maybe I'm
141:27 - just too hard on myself but I am the
141:29 - nature of code book I am deep and
141:31 - working on you can follow it at
141:34 - um
141:36 - it's on GitHub you can find it join the
141:38 - Discord
141:39 - I'm tired uh check out the shorts uh
141:43 - check out all the stuff that I talked
141:45 - about before I've got to go I'm gonna
141:47 - put the goodbye screen on but I have no
141:50 - music so I will sing it I can find some
141:53 - of the music though

141:58 - forget this dot uh this dot thanks for
142:01 - all of you for tuning in I'm going to

142:08 - can give some feedback now to the uh
142:12 - product I'm still talking
142:15 - which goodbye
142:18 - hold on I've got an idea
142:32 - as always this you might not actually

Cleaned transcript:

thank you foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign there for a little bit but hopefully you're hearing me I'm about to get started in what on the screen says 30 seconds but uh might be a little bit longer than that but I'm working on it like the slight shirt and sweater combination is very off today so bear with me oh I'm still my mic is hot my mic is live okay muting myself I got 10 seconds I'm setting up people I'm setting up oh it's ready foreign power on my soundboard is out so I can't play any more music this dot this dot this dot song I Gotta Sing the music cause there's no more music in the sound board it won't charge it's been plugged in for the last 10 minutes but making any sound going to turn the camera on me now um oh no that was the wrong button ah there I am hello everybody I know it's been a while since I last live streamed I really hope this is working and you're seeing me right now I'm seeing me right now because I have a monitor in front of me that shows me my face hi Dan I know I'm very uncomfortable uh normally what I do at the beginning of a coding train live stream is I make a sound from a train whistle I have so many train whistles right now but we will use because I know Stig is in the audience oh wait a second here I don't I don't see the chat in my Monitor let me open this let me get this out here so I can keep an eye the corner of my eye on the chat uh all right all right just uh bear with me here I did not uh this is back to back to the roots of the coding train where I barely was set up and ready to go when the time arrived for me to stream uh okay um thank you to the people of Denmark Who present it wasn't really the people of Denmark it was a small group who gathered this past summer for proston community in Copenhagen and uh uh gave me this wonderful treasured gift now of mine a authentic 1950s era uh Danish train whistle actually used by Danish train conductors in Denmark uh and I will begin today's live stream with the traditional blowing of the train whistle it's like it's like uh for Rosh Hashanah we blow the shofar and here on the coding train we blow the train whistle for the new year it's not the New Year it's like November it's not even the beginning of a school year or the beginning of January or any sort of New Year under any calendars at Lunar New Year nope none of those things it's just been a while since I live streamed so it feels like the start of something new thank you thank you for indulging me with that um and I know uh rlb in the chat is saying Danish danish but that's one of the things that I especially enjoyed about being Denmark uh everything was called like dance not everything but a lot of things were called Dan something for example I could hail a Dan taxi the taxi service was Dan taxi I'm I'm probably pronouncing that incorrectly but I quite enjoyed it hello to uh XX Mr PhD um Osama Issa says you speak so fast no I don't you're watching 1.5x don't you know you're watching one before right check your settings it's 1.5 x living life at 3x baby if anybody knows that reference if anybody knows that reference I will send you a coding trade tshirt okay I couldn't grade teachers don't even exist but I will have them made but actually that is a sec that is related to today's live stream uh Kathy says hello everybody say thank you to Kathy many other people too but Kathy for uh has been doing a tremendous amount of work on the coding Train website which I will be going through and talking about today um one thing I'm wondering about um is in in the time since I last live streamed um I believe YouTube released a new q a feature for live streaming and I didn't have quite a bit smart to do didn't bother to check if I had to enable that or anything on a live stream but is that feature running does anybody know does anybody know anything about it I've got I've got a second computer over here in case you're wondering I used to cover my second computer with a green paper so it was invisible did I just put it off to the side but let me double check let me take a look at the stream page um and um uh to kind of ask a question engage with your audience start a q a oh oh it's me I have to do it I'm gonna start a q a oh Marco Silvio oh no no sound that's the song I usually play when somebody joins the membership but the iPad where I play sound effects oh it's me talking to myself uh it's it's it won't come alive it's been plugged in for like an hour also the heat is on here it is on and um it's getting kind of warm in here so I'm now going to turn that off um because it is a loud noise uh it is an electric heater that is just one of these garage heaters because I am in a garage space um I think it's time for me to do a tour of this space soon uh because it's kind of ready for that um wait okay oh and coding Garden is here I don't know go to Garden hopefully you didn't mind my hilarious tweet this morning I don't know if you could you still go find my tweet does Twitter's Twitter still up by the way I had this idea digression after digression after digression is the name of the game on the coding train but um what are we going to do today was what some people had asked in the chat and I was kind of thinking oh we should just mess around with Twitter while it's still active but I made a tweet this morning to share the live stream that um coding Garden came and did as a guest I think this was back in 2018 like another like another era of like like that's like a hundred years ago at this in in today's time um in Internet time but uh where he demonstrated how to build a full stack clone of Twitter so I thought hey why don't we just rebuild Twitter today I think it was Beck Hill who I'm like Beck Hill's number one fan ever since um I got to see her perform at the evening of unnecessary uh detail there's a fly let me know if you can hear it it's in the light that likes my light um tweeted something about starting something new called shrub and all your followers are leaves so that works with coding Garden so we could just rebuild Twitter today on today's live stream what do you guys think about that probably not what we're gonna do um but uh uh in the before times okay start a q a wait no no okay but I was coming back to something the membership let's let's go for the Q a we're gonna see how this works start a q a say something oh uh I have to start a q i I'm starting a Q and A oh q a start q a okay I started a q a questions so I think if you post a question it'll show up now interesting I'm looking at on this side I'm slightly afraid to bring it on to my live stream um also uh yeah gosh I have so many things to talk about today and I I kind of had some notes uh um wait there are questions but they're just showing up in the chat like shouldn't they show up somewhere else I see is this working I see questions oh I just see questions but this is no different than watching the chat are you all posting to the questions like am I not seeing regular chat or there's separate chats I have no idea what's going on there's like a lot of questions way too many questions for me to answer biggest fear you know I had one of those dreams no let's not get into that edit that out oh wait I'm live sorry what Oregon Trail is an old game right it brings back a lot of memory yes so my planned topic for today is to and uh I don't let's see if this button's gonna work uh uh oh wait a second did I not make a button for it okay hold on please hold I can see the question I can see the questions but it's just a stream of questions like literally look I love YouTube and I appreciate all of the tremendous amount of work and features that are available the decoding crane would not just about YouTube so I don't really mean this as a criticism I know this is a new feature it's in beta or maybe alpha or maybe it's not but um and I do I do like that I'm seeing a lot of questions but I would what I think it needs is some organization to the questions or maybe maybe I just need a moderator to pick them out and there's some way I can you know through the uh I'm sure very easily accessible and beginner friendly YouTube API bring um bring questions onto the screen uh okay will I actually play the Oregon drug yes yes yes okay hold on uh so let's end the Q a because this is not working I'll do the Q a later and when I'm just focused on it I can look at the questions and answer the questions but right now I am not ready to do the Q a uh so uh coding Garden writes I have specifically sent this in the question box so there is a question box and now if I hit n q a it will remove all the questions that's terrible okay hold on questions top live chat okay I'm going to leave that open so I can now switch to the chat again I think questions live chat this is so I think it's very useful but um I think and probably the intention is for a moderator to be uh kind of operating the chat stuff because I can't easily with the way I run my live streams switch back and forth maybe I should have two different monitors one of the questions one with the chat I don't know sorry for not having a plan about that but I see Marcelo Silva's I posted a question but this is a regular chat message okay so um oh I know what I could do I can see the chat over here and then I can put the questions over here on this screen I'm a genius genius I have multiple screens okay but don't show me the Q a box I want to see the questions there we go all right so I see your questions here which oh that's the chat questions okay I see your questions here there are so many of them and then I see your chat here so okay uh thank you rlb for your lovely message hello from Belarus um all right so it's already been I don't know like 10 minutes or so I haven't done anything at all let me add my button for what we're going to do today because this is going to be necessary add a scene scene a scene I'm going to put it here and I'm going to call it Oregon Trail uh and it's going to be the um Apple II okay um okay that should do it let's see if this works oh no signal that's fine though so um just very briefly okay so I'm over here now um and when we get to the Oregon Trail we're going to play the Oregon Trail on this the blue thing you're saying it will be the output of this monitor the blue you're not saying it the blue thing you are seeing will be the output of this monitor um which is fed through I don't know if you can see this a um like analog video out to HDMI converter with its very long HDMI cable hi that runs all the way along the floor all the way back to over here where the streaming PC is and then I'm standing at my desk over here and here I am so um before I get going with the content I want to tell you about uh today's sponsor of the coding train which I am really excited by like a major thing has changed in a huge project that I did recently so I really want to tell you about it and I just want to pull up this page so I make sure um I have all the correct information okay so let me pull over to here let me put this uh banner up top which is the link that you're going to want codingtrain.com choo choo so oh not Cody wait it says codingtrain.com that's not what it should say [Laughter] oops okay I will redirect that look we're going to live through a pull request to redirect that link because the correct link I am the worst uh the correct link is curiositystream.com choo choo let's go there no no no I can't oh I can't get anything right I can't even spell curiosity there's no you uh it's European somebody will know that reference uh curiositystream.com choo choo there we go curiositystream.com that's the URL you're going to want let's go to uh GitHub welcome to the coding train uh GitHub a coding train slash the coding train um there is a nice little redirects dot Json file right here that I can very quickly uh am I not logged in oh sign up no I don't want to sign up I want to log in people thank you sign in uh oh thank you thank you oh Authentication twofactor does the music turn on yet I think I've lost all of my viewers in the last five minutes uh Authenticator uh uh let's just switch back to here so you don't see me typing my code five nine one see I typed different numbers than I said that's how much that's how much I care about security uh bring this back over here we're going to go to redirects.json we're going to hit edit and we're going to add a redirect which goes from uh choo choo to here and so now if you um it'll take a bit for the site to rebuild but um hopefully and I'm no no no no all right how many of you think I should do this are there any Twitter Engineers right now struggling with the decision as to whether they should do this they should not I will not even though I have many many many times in my life create a new branch uh redirect sponsor propose the change I'm proposing the change let's create the pull request do we dare um there's no conflicts I mean it's going to run a whole lot of tests and things but all those tests are technically for building the um website by the way the the correct link is uh in what is is uh in the description and um uh I didn't make I don't think I made a pinned comment but I could um okay let's see here uh chat oh it's the Q a I can't type a chat message here because now I have the Q a going ah can I start this whole thing over I'll come back to the sponsor in a bit uh you know what it is and I'm gonna come back to tell you why that's exciting what major change has happened um but I am um let's go let's talk about some of some recent announcements about things that have been happening on the coding train and I will come back and merge this pull request soon enough okay so let's go over to Discord so if you aren't in the coding train Discord um come and join us this is at thecodytrain.com Discord um it is where I once a month will post an announcement about things going on you can see that there were two announcements posted uh November 12th and then yesterday because I didn't post anything in October I'm very very strict on myself about limiting my use of the at everyone uh mention in Discord so if you want to come to a Discord Channel where the uh owner of the Discord server is very strict with themselves about their use of at everyone than the coding train is for you um so let's talk about things that have been happening I have a new coding challenge video out it's about 45 minutes long I built a 3D renderer let me keep an eye on the chat here um am I looking at the chat yes um uh I built a simple 3D renderer in applesoft basic maybe I can run it and talk about it a bit today one of the things I would like to do is look at some recent comments and questions that are posted on that video let me come back to that another thing I am you know uh I started working with a a new team to develop uh shorts I know people have strong feelings one way or the other I'm gonna try this as a one month experiment I've recorded a whole bunch of them uh answering your questions speaking of q a um so if you haven't noticed these and want to check them out um uh you know this link is available in the Discord um but you could come see one of the recent shorts that I posted there also his Tick Tock account I'm sorry to disappoint you but I have yet to do any uh Dancing In The Tick Tock account although I was ahead of my time was I not because I remember live streaming I don't know five plus years ago where I would play music and dance around that was my thing uh the other announcement here is that there is a live stream incoming oh wait that's right now that's what you're watching right now so if you want to get notifications about when the live streams are happening uh Beyond uh YouTube If you subscribe and bell and all that I do tend to try to announce them in Discord um there is a notifications role if you're not aware if you're already in the Discord you can sign up for a notifications role which uh will get you additional notifications beyond my more rare uh everyone um the Discord invite is not working okay this is why I live stream to discover these things let's can anyone confirm or deny that this is the case let's go thecodingtrain.com Discord okay invite invalid okay wait guess what guess where that goes it's a redirect so we're here why not welcome to cryptocurity train where I reprogram redirects on my website I find broken links and fix them live streaming for hours on end finding broken links and fixing them okay edit Edith no what do I do what do ah edit file so let's first figure out where is the redirect Discord Discord Discord okay I thought we had this back okay let's try is it the coding train we might have changed it to that nope okay so we're gonna I'm gonna create I don't think this is gonna show anything uh we'll have to figure that out later but I think if I go here and then do uh invite people um and edit link um No Limit expire never generate a new link copy and um let's then go back to here and paste that in there so we'll use this invite right now I don't know what happened to our fancy um other uh vanity URL but this should now be fixed and the Discord link worked for me says Clara okay well I don't know now the invite in the video description works oh interesting what's in there I guess I could have just grabbed that one but I'm not going to worry about it right now I will figure this out later at the moment uh apparently there's an invite in the video description that should work and then uh this new one that I just added to here should also work okay back to Discord um the other thing that I really wanted to mention is that um coding train social media is doing some new uh things let's see it's Twitter is Twitter still up looks like it um so on Instagram you'll see there are two posted right now uh what we are doing is sharing projects from the passenger showcase which is a new feature on the website so if you've ever made something related to and it can be very Loosely related to like my goal is for people to share what they're doing and the organizing principle of the coding Train website is to take a project and share it associated with one of my videos which isn't the maybe the you know maybe someday I'll have to rethink that so but you know don't worry it's not required that you like watch the video you started with the sample code you were made this project and it doesn't have to be so perfect so if you made something you want to share if it's related to uh if you made something that uses the seller automata algorithm you know find the video that that uses that I have I have something for everyone so if we look at any of these uh most recently let's look at the more rows I'm not logged in so I guess I can't click on these um but um you could have your work featured on the coding train social media so tag the coding train on Twitter or the dot coding.train on Instagram um and uh please submit to the passenger showcase if you're wondering what I'm talking about with the passenger showcase um what that is and and soon coming soon in fact I'm supposed to have a meeting about this today uh there will be a new page under Community which is just the page for just the Showcase which will show all the Showcase projects we're working on that but right now you can see uh here on the homepage there are passenger showcase highlights they cycle through different ones so we can see image dithering uh Labyrinth so that's wild let's take a look at this one um this is based off of oh I love this that is what that is lovely let's try I gotta get this soundboard working so I don't have to keep singing let's try plugging it into a different plug I mean that should work I'm gonna just try plugging into this laptop see if it'll charge off of this laptop which might be a bad idea for a variety of reasons but we'll see um is there any chance of a coding trade Mastodon instance oh oh oh funny you should ask this is a great project thank you let me let me Circle back to that um and then um if you go to any given coding challenge like if I go to this poisson disk on here we'll see the video the time codes um the source code for it and then oh my goodness what nobody has submitted you could be the first you could submit a plaso plasso projects uh to this page be the first one featured here so we're gonna have to go to a different uh challenge let's try Purple Rain I know has a lot so you can see here um here are all the projects that have been submitted uh related to the Purple Rain video and if I click on any one of them we can take a look at it Casio I love this this is fantastic um so oh PB is asking um this is so funny I have a q a going and I'm answering the questions from the live chat this is very on brand for me to like completely mess this up uh uh okay uh oh so many good questions um okay coding Garden is handling that one in the chat uh thank you thank you uh for uh coded Garden to handle that and and let me just read the the comment when working on a team it is better to commit to a separate branch and then have your changes reviewed by other team members before merging into Maine and so um this is also true like for the coding Train website the main branch is the deployment Branch so if I were to submit a change if I were to merge commit that directly to Maine and it had a mistake in it it could break the website and by committing it to another Branch the GitHub system actually runs through a set of tests and offers the chance to check it before it's merged this doesn't mean you can't break stuff like it's no different than me making the pull request and then just merging it but there are a few checks and balances and tests that run along the way that's what I'm waiting for to happen so right here um we can see I think it's actually done all successful yeah sorry so it's actually done now all the tests checks have passed usually there's a lot more so I don't know what's going on here but uh and maybe it's just because I'm anyway the tests have passed it's got a deploy preview I'm not really sure what's going on but I'm going to merge it um and then we'll also take the site takes quite a while to build because of the amount of content and the Gatsby system that I'm using so the redirect probably won't be live just yet it could be like 20 minutes to be honest like it takes a built so I'll come back to it we'll check it um uh lots of questions about all the Twitter drama I don't I'm I'm not I don't think I'll be addressing the Twitter drama other than uh making poorly uh thought out not funny dad jokes about it um to the best of my ability okay back to announcements anything else oh and so more about the website I was kind of showing you some of the features of the website and it is my intention to make a video announcement about the website even if that's like a year after the website launched uh if anybody wants to help with that I don't you know I don't know that's really a serious call for help because I don't know what what help I really need other than getting myself to do it but I really want to encourage people to read this uh very um thoughtful case study report about all the design thinking and um uh process and methodology that went in and I'm my green screen is it is it this that's what's no it's over here what's over here oh this is uh this is a bookcase so hold on that's really bothering me so I just need to like turn the camera slightly that way and I think it will go away yeah this is a bell um which I can put over the side um but um there's a lot of thought and care and time went into the work on this website from Design Systems International and obviously a ton of people from the coding train Community who really helped so and you should check out all the work of Design Systems International but if you want to learn about web design and systems design I think I I would like to think that you will learn a lot and be inspired by their wonderful work on the coding Train website um okay uh look let me take a question I'm just gonna every once in a while I'm gonna look over on the Q a and I'm gonna pluck a question from thin air oh the heat came back on it it got cold in here I guess um let me know if the audio bothers you um much with the that going do you work full time for YouTube well first of all I definitely don't work fulltime for YouTube I think what the question means is do you do YouTube your YouTube work is that your kind of fulltime job or do you still actually program for a living so the answer to that is neither I definitely don't actually program for a living and so you know you should you should be wary of me in that sense like I am here as hopefully somebody who can uh help share knowledge with you help inspire you maybe uh you know dare I say entertain you you know I understand that you that there is quite probably a large category of people who are not entertained by me at all but it's possible I know that that small some people are maybe a little bit so um but I would say my my if I were to characterize my fulltime job well so I do have a fulltime salary job which is what I get paid to do and YouTube is not that I do derive revenue from the coding train work for sure but my fulltime day job I am on sabbatical right now from that I will be I'm going back to teaching in January is at New York University so there is a graduate program an undergraduate program in interactive media uh ITP and IMA and I teach classes there this is how I started doing all this I was making videos for my classes then I posted the videos online then I started live streaming then I started making videos that don't have to do with my classes I got to get back to making videos that I'm doing my classes so it's all kind of a big mess um but that is my fulltime job uh you know the higher education system in the United States is broken in so many ways so I I don't you know make I don't want to make any bones it's not the right expression about uh you know the complexity and opportunity that is that only some people and privilege that some people have to be able to attend a school like NYU in terms of the expense and the cost and the um you know the location and all of that but if you are somebody who's applying to college or graduate school you're certainly welcome to check out ITP IMA and and uh you know ask me a question on social media or email the department who can forward them you can find my email online I'm just very bad I don't want to I'm answering my email uh I know where I'm going with this I'm just saying you know hey uh itp.nyu.edu let's see what's happening with the codingtrain website being built so I'm I'm logging into my netlify account right now um just to take a look at that let's log in with GitHub I I just moved my screen away so you couldn't see it uh okay deploy preview production okay so let's take a look at this so I think I could show this to you with no problem hmm I'll show you what the mess that I'm looking at now this is a deployment log I don't know why this is happening I mean I sort of do but um the logs are really just complaining about how long it's taking and they're complaining a lot what are the stickers on the laptop is a great question which is in the chat not in the Q a fascinating I wanted to look and see why can't I scroll to the top of this thing why can't I the deploy log is I mean let's look at the side 405 of these numbers going down yes they are at some point we're gonna get to the top this is insane there we go deploy log netlifies robots are busy building and deploying your site today at 10 12 A.M and it's just taking a very long time uh we can see the sort of build logs and this is where I think it's just giving me the same warning over and over again because this is not a new 14 seconds every time unless it's building a lot of pages in parallel and a whole lot of warnings are coming out anybody has any Gatsby graphql netlify expertise and knowledge who wants to help me understand what's going on here I'd be uh certainly glad to um glad glad for your um contribution all right so stickers um this is processing processing is the creative coding Java development environment that I started with in my teaching work I would say uh back in 2003 uh uh processing the stickers for processing three there are newer processing stickers P5 is the JavaScript um p5.js JavaScript reimagination of processing they both are part of the processing Foundation processing Community Day where this is the sticker for an event in Los Angeles and many years ago these are this is the coding train this dot character coding training ml5 is a machine learning library Gotham girls junior Derby so roller derby you can't see that can you um Roller Derby uh group that my daughter was involved with for a brief period of time Gloria pickle my dog whoops coding rainbow if you know what coding rainbow is then if you know you know that's the thing you say uh rise in code hi hello there is uh Jason haglin's an art business I don't know what to call it find Jason hagland and hi hello there on Instagram makes wonderful art and stickers so most of these are all coding train stickers actually never forget this dot I'll refactor that later you can get you can buy these or you can sign up to be a coding trained member and I will send you a sticker pack I won't send it to you personally but Jason who makes all these stickers will send it to you okay I wanted the redirect to work is it still deploying we'll come back to that all right so let me talk to you about my two um Sans music don't worry you can watch this back later you can watch it back at 2x thank you coding Garden for posting links in the chat to various things that I'm talking about do you guys hear that there's a crackling noise what is that let me mute is it just some weird you guys don't hear any weird audio feedback or anything oh you know what I don't know what it is but it's coming out of that monitor and I'm going to assume as long as it's not being broadcast I can mute that monitor uh Marius asked will there ever be a video on the you are bot please keep asking me that question right now I'm kind of waiting um you know I'm a huge fan of the television program called Severance and I made a whole sort of version of the macro data refinement which is this computer program that runs in the TV show and I want to risk spoiling anything go and watch it if you are able to and haven't already um I made a bot about one of the characters in the show so I want to get I want to make a lot of content about the show and those projects but I think I'm gonna wait until um I know when the season 2 premiere date is and then try to make that content in the lead up to it so Marius I I don't know where you are and where you'll be many months from now but keep on asking me that question because it's coming um uh okay so let me start talking to you about um the Apple II because this is going to lead us to the project that I want to start today just curious is this ever going to turn on no I wonder if there's just something wrong with this iPad no all right probably shouldn't ask for your what I think I need to do is I need to take this iPad and I need to just plug it into its own and maybe this charging cable is no good if we're going to have any chance of any uh sound I need to find I have a plug I have a a um what do you call this a lightning cable this is not plug I'm going to plug it into here I'm plugging it into its own power source over where you can't see and that's why I will just check it in a little while it's plugged in it's charging I will come back to it okay so the Apple II the Apple II uh computer was my childhood computer um and I have always wanted to revisit it and when my parents recently uh moved I was helping clean out the attic and found I mean I knew it was there and this was always the plans it wasn't like oh this like amazing Discovery as I Unearthed it but um I was able to take home with me the um that Apple 2 plus computer now I there was a live stream you can find it where I turned it on for the very first time since probably in close to 40 years somewhere maybe 30 35 years um and if you go back and find that live stream uh it's working and it runs I'm loading disks and doing all sorts of stuff with it and then at some point during the live stream it starts to crackle and make a sound and this is a very common thing that happens I'm gonna go grab it right now um the old Apple II power supplies I learned the capacitors in them they have a certain name for them the rifa capacitors maybe if you if they sit for a long time this is the actual power supply they start to they get they fry they burst they crackle they smoke up it made it was a horrible smell smoke coming out of it so I was very concerned and I thought all was lost the good news is this is an easyish thing to replace um if I was a bit more comfortable with hardware and I guess I can switch over to this view so you can maybe see it a little bit better if I was a bit more attuned to working with a uh electronics parts and hardware and soldering this one could probably be easily restored I was even told by someone who that's like it doesn't even matter just pull those out use it anyway um but what I did instead is I ordered a kit from my reactive micro which is a sort of like modern rebuild of the Apple II power supply and I hooked that up with the Apple II and uh it was working again then I had some other issues and I won't go through all the different steps But ultimately the Apple II that I'm using right now is mostly put together from parts that I bought off eBay so the monitor is original the disk drives uh even the um I had to get a a new case there's a different keyboard now so you know for me to say it's my childhood computer it's like it's the ship of Theseus you know if I'm swapping Parts in and out of it eventually if I swap every single part I'm totally butchering the tail of the the the the ship of Theseus um uh metaphor here but um you know is it really my childhood computer not really but enough of it is and the spirit of it is there so um I've been I've now made three videos with the Apple II um which you can find on YouTube um all of the source code for those videos is here uh the Oh no you're not seeing this um I made a snake game a fractal tree and most recently this 3D cube so for example if I go in here um you know I made it did a few things in this video I can um I can look at the code and one of the things you can do is you can find this basic code that I write in the video and I'm sorry that this coffee mug which should be over here is blocking things I can paste this I can take this um Apple to JavaScript emulator there are two that I like to use there is this emulator which I will get to in a second and then there's this emulator so this is not a true this one is not what you might call a true emulator it's not emulating the Apple II hardware and processor itself it's just converting the basic code into JavaScript which allows it to run so much faster so this is the actual basic code that I write in the video that renders and rotates this spinning Cube I can take that code and go over to this which is a true emulator and I'm going to uh hit reset here so I can get to a Dos commit prompt um I know do you say DOS prompt with the Apple II Apple II prompt I'm going to paste in the code so you can actually paste in this emulator which is great because it's like as if I'm typing in all these line numbers um so this will take a little bit and then now I can uh well oops I can run this code in this emulator and you will see it uh appearing momentarily and uh here it is it is running incredibly slow so one of the things that I address in the video is how could this be optimized and this is something that I would love to go quickly and look at some of the comments because there were some great suggestions and so far I haven't seen anybody try any of these you know maybe not everyone just has all the Time in the World to Tinker around with applesauce basic Watcher coded Trend video let me spend all day see if I can optimize this you know 40 year old uh code base system but um let's take a look at the the comments briefly for this video and see what we can find out um so I'm going to go over to videos um I'm going to go to this uh coding challenge episode of coding together and I'm gonna mute it um and let's let's take a look okay so um whoops I wanted to see the comments a little bit bigger so let's take a look at this one uh you should do all the multiply and divide using bit shift and Edition use a lookup table for sine and cosine so one of the things I absolutely don't bother to worry about and we can go back to my code to see is you know uh so there's a lot of multiplication and one of the things that's really absurd that I'm doing is in my effort to uh explain all of the math and the way that I'm used to doing things now as a teacher I want things to be very explicit and readable and I don't mind having longer code that is less efficient if it's more understandable and relatable and so I have a lot of multiply by zero which is just absolutely a waste of computation because we all know what multiplied by zero is but in my head I'm leading up to the point where the rotation matrices might not always have a zero in them and that could be a variable so I need it in there but even so this is interesting for this comment to address um could I actually use bitshift and addition to execute multiplication operations and that would be faster lookup table for sine and cosine This was um this was the most commonly and I did mention it in the video suggested uh fix like one of the things that I do is I there is a loop here that I have to do these mathematical operations um it's interesting that the ace Magpie by the way right the Apple 2 videos are how I started watching so uh I'd be curious to see like are you interested in the you know literally a thousand other videos on the channel that have nothing to do with the Apple too um so I have this Loop that I'm doing eight times where um so if I had the sine operation and the cosine operation right here in the code I would have to be executing those mathematical operations eight times which I know would be very very inefficient so at least I'm calculating and my finger won't go up that high but at least I'm calculating them uh once before the loop up here and then but what if but this is still happening every frame so what if at the beginning we built a large array do we have enough RAM and this is a consideration when you only have you know 48k of ram that's 48 kilobytes not 48 megabytes certainly not 48 gigabytes 48 kilobytes of ram could I make an array that has 360 elements in it maybe one calculation for every degree of rotation I don't know um and then look up the calculated values from that array that would certainly improve things let's see if we can find a couple other comments my goal for these live streams is to curate these in advance but I um I love that he shows us his mistakes it's great to hear uh thanks coding Adventures everyone check out the coding Adventures YouTube channel um increasing performance okay excluding reprogramming and assembly so programming in Assembly Language I have the 6502 book uh I might like to investigate that precomputed Sign Co values deleting the entire HDR buffer on every frame takes a lot of time this cannot be done during vsync as someone suggested not even let's go the filling of the 4K bank with zero takes almost one second probably the largest contributor lack of performance redraw the existing lines in Black just keep two arrays and flip among them as you draw each page so you have always have access to the previous points and Alternate the rotate subroutine to use either one this is so great I don't know if you're following this but this is exactly what I need to do there's a shape table functionality so there's a lot there's a lot here everybody read Nelson's comments but really I think this is the answer and I'll I'll show you whoops I'm in the wrong place so what is what is Nelson suggesting so I am storing um sorry I am calculating let me look let me look back up ultimately these are the points that I am drawing I'm drawing everything from this array projected those are the final rotated and projected points of the cube into 3D I'm storing them into two pairs of X Y coordinates and drawing a line that is white before that happens right before that happens at the beginning I call this memory address which wipes the high resolution Graphics buffer and in my mind that's like the easiest thing in the world to do right I haven't like it's literally just 280 by 192 pixels just wipe the whole thing that's like the fastest operation computers do now but it's actually it's got to take every pixel I guess even the ones that are already black and turn them to Black it's very very slow uh and also the the the the refresh rate of the Monitor and everything gets in the way apparently so um um so the idea here would be for me to essentially duplicate this every line that I draw before I draw it I erase the previous one with H Color equals zero which is black so instead of wiping 280 times 192 pixels I'm only wiping the necessary pixels so I would need an additional array to store the previous locations uh and then an additional call to this it would be a lot the reason I didn't do it is it's a lot more code and a lot more work I do this in one thing you can see however if you're interested if I go back um I think is it did I upload it yes so this particular example does that so this particular example is just drawing a line I'll show you what it does oops I can't seem to get to the right place um Ctrl C text new so this little simple program which is just drawing a line and by the way oh there's a whole other totally insane thing going on because that Line's supposed to be white I don't have time I mean I have to move on at some point for my random digressions but um but this uh Bill oh yeah var19 the idea of building the Matrix outside of the loop is another great one um that uh a var19 if you're the same person who suggested this maybe in a in a pull request was there a pull request or issue let's find it um yeah rotation uh so this is an example uh so okay um I don't know if this is the same thing you're suggesting and Oscar had an apple 2C that had 128k of ram um so this idea of constructing the rotation Matrix just once before the draw loop with an angle of one degree then use that same Matrix every time to transform the current coordinates you know what only now that this suddenly make sense to me so I'm I'm assuming always a cube that is uh with no rotation and so what I do is I calculate the rotation Matrix to rotate it by one degree then the next time no rotation two degrees then the next time no rotation three degrees what var19 in the uh chat is suggesting is rotate it by one degree and I already have that calculated one degree rotation Matrix so apply that to the one degree rotated one and that would certainly I think help quite a bit um so um I I would welcome pull requests with these improvements if you are to do a pull request with the Improvement what I would suggest is um add a new file this is the wrong place add a new file uh instead of editing one of mine because I would like mine to remain the same exactly what I did in the coding demonstrations themselves okay I've got about an hour left I I don't know how I managed to continue to do this I hope that people enjoy these live streams even when there's I don't even know where I'm going or what I'm doing with things but I think it's time it's time to talk about the main event for today and I kind of want to know I'm I'm I'm I haven't taken a moment to stop talking I think for the last half an hour or so and I can start to feel it we take a few deep breaths here let's see if the coding Train website has rebuilt can I go I don't uh um complete it okay so if everything goes according to plan if I go to the codingtrain.com choo choo great okay so now I can talk about what I want to talk about so uh apologies the the link in the top right is technically incorrect but I now have it redirect to the correct link which is curiositystream.com choo choo which is the link that you'll find in this video's description so um before I made any of those apple II videos I had the chance to work with uh uh the streaming company nebula which I am a part of the it's owned by creators and created by creators one of which is me um nebula if I go to nebula.tv what is code um you will see that I have this course on the website called uh what is code and let me make it a little bit bigger and I guess I don't want to make it that and it is essentially it's for the total beginner so I'm not 100 sure I think that I mean it's my goal that anybody from Total beginner to experience programmer alike could enjoy and find this course interesting in terms of uh the my perspective on what is code and Computing and a bit of the history behind uh and context for programming languages in basic but this is actually a set of stepbystep lessons for total beginners that covers uh variables conditionals update the banner to be the coding train oh no so the banner is just a fail but this is all secretly me getting it so that you have to like really type it in and you're more inclined to I don't know what the fourdimensional chess game I'm playing with you here is but anyway this is a beginner course where I build the whole project and I I don't know it was a really fun to make um I think it can even like just play the introduction here uh the production quality is better than anything I have ever uh done myself and I just want to thank nebula and the nebula team for collaborating with me on this so hello welcome oh hi so excited you are okay my name is Dan that's weird all right this is weird 20 years teaching coding okay yeah yeah yeah 20 blah blah blah blah coding coding coding teacher teaching I've heard it all before um so the reason why I'm mentioning all of this is because today's the sponsor actually of the coding train is curiosity stream oh wait I have a fun idea uh add image text okay uh text uh the uh the okay uh the uh okay uh this is a professional operation people laughs oh yeah yeah you would never know you never know that that was wrong okay um the reason why I'm mentioning all this is because um curiosity stream uh is a streaming service with an incredible library of documentaries um Dr Hannah Frye has some wonderful documentaries about math maths so if you like math and science and if you like biology and animals and climate science and all sorts of stuff curiosity stream is like one of my favorite streaming services like if I'm just sitting around and being like what what kind of interesting uh uh math and science uh related documentary do I want to relax to you this evening uh there's just literally thousands of documentaries and with the coding trains um uh coupon code choo choo you can get access to all of curiosity stream for 14.79 for the entire year and what is totally new is previously as of like a week ago the nebula class what is code was a separate purchase uh somewhere in the 100 range uh to to view nebula classes but now with uh the Curiosity stream bundle which comes with nebula right the Curiosity stream bundle comes with all of nebula so everything that's on nebula um um and uh my favorite thing on nebula is uh let's just look for it I am like obsessed with this show jet lag the game so uh if you like travel and competition shows and like crazy weird challenges in for Far Away foreign places uh you will uh we will not be able to resist this show I'm so obsessed with it and I know they just filmed a new season of it uh my kids love watching it Mike I've been watching this with my daughter and we're like the biggest nebula fans I just have one thing to say to all of you which is team Ben I will go no further than that um but so if you sign up for the Curiosity stream bundle which is like less than 15 for the whole year you also get access to all of nebula and nebula classes comes with nebula if you sign up directly this is so confusing there's my price hack if you sign up for the bundle then you can get all of nebula classes for just one dollar a month extra so that's now the cheapest way to get the classes I mentioned this on Twitter um Graham's class has been really great for me to like learn how to do better audio for my stuff um there's some other uh Patrick Williams class some great music ones um so I encourage you to um check there's a really nice live streaming one that I don't see right now so I'm sorry I went on for so long about this um um so but if you like the Apple tooth my whole thing was if you like the Apple II stuff you like documentaries you're interested in the nebula class and all of nebula the cheapest way now to get it is through the link that is on the top of the screen the countrytrain.com okay now moving on um yes there was Tom Scott also did a video collaborating with the jet lag team I don't know I kind of like I would love to play the jet lag game although I think I might be too old that's like terrible at it I'd be like but what if I have to pee in the middle of the race that's literally what I would worry about that that's going to get edited out right we're on a tape delay right how long is the tape delay what no no no tape delay okay anyway um choo choo um my son five shows interest in programming any tips on a project want to use P5 doing together oh so first of all you're probably aware of this um this is Danny asks this in the Q a chat um and let me the the is always going to be there now let me uh get that out of the way um um so you're probably aware of scratch which is a uh block based uh coding environment that's great for kids my kids have both used it when they were younger uh P5 I mean there's no rules to this but my I would say probably P5 makes sense to start um in the sort of flight well here in the states we would say around I would say around sixth grade which is um 11. my daughter's in sixth grade so I know that um but um certainly I love the idea when I when when my I think when my son was five and my daughter was like no no he was more like four because she was a baby we made a game in processing together which was like used a picture of her and a blueberry and we had to like throw blueberries at the baby and then if the blueberries hit the baby the baby would grow bigger somewhere on my the depths of my laptop is this game that I made so I do think um there's a lot of fun things you could do and it sort of depends on what she likes um I'm you know easiest for me to like sort of scroll through the coding challenges and see but um like a variation of like a game like this Pie in the Sky game she might like some of these fun like video things where you kind of like use the webcam and distort it uh slide puzzle and you said your son sorry I'm um thinking of my daughter here um slide puzzle uh could be fun with kids but and then and then maybe um any of these like algorithmic ones like the snowflakes so you know poke through these see if any of these resonate with you some of them are obviously more complex than others so you might look at the code and see how like you know how much code there is um but um yeah there's a lot there's a you know I haven't really been making these and the last three have been Apple II Plus so uh but they're you know there are 175 of them so even though I've slowed down enormously in the last year in terms of these coding Challenge videos there are a lot okay um Johan says I'm canceling Disney plus and Netflix for this well I don't blame you although I I'm really excited I haven't watched Andor but everyone's telling me Andor uh is really really good on Disney plus and I do have a Disney Plus subscription so I should watch it okay let's move over so let's talk about the Oregon Trail so this is the beginning of a journey that we are all going to go on together really me and maybe you if you if you choose to accept let's go over to the Apple II plus and get that going uh um oh yeah I have a button and I have an hour before I really have to go so we've got an hour for this now I'm just looking for my Apple II button I made an apple II button did I forget to sit this one no where did it go oh here it is Oregon Trail okay so I'm gonna bring my secondary laptop where I have the chat going over with me here um so let me know in the chat if the audio is good still and I'm gonna sit here oh oh I get to sit down and never sit down while I'm streaming um and I'm going to go to the live chat and I'm going to turn the power on here now before I go anywhere before I do more can you see this it's of course I guess I could pull it around here it doesn't really matter this uh I referenced I talked about this in my most recent video where I talked about this floppy emu which is a disk drive emulator so essentially um I have an SD card which has you know room for a thousand floppy disks or more I'm making that number up I haven't done the math but you know this is a floppy disk is like 140k and this is like uh four gigabytes this SD card I don't know why I said 32 because I think I said that in the video but I was wrong um so uh what this will do is emulate the disk drive um so I'm going to turn on the monitor now one thing might happen right now and I'll be curious to know in the chat um so the monitor is on and I am 49 years old and my hearing and eyesight is atrocious and there's no way I'm ever going to hear the highpitched wine that is coming from this monitor but I know for a fact that um when I released my first Apple II video many viewers could hear a very high pitched frequency sound going during the entire video and we're complaining so if is that is something you could hear and it's bothering you I will go back to OBS and try to put a lowpass filter on but I didn't bother to try to figure that out before I started streaming so I'm going to turn this computer on and hopefully and you're going to tell me in the chat you're going to see the output of this monitor on the blue in that blue screen that is empty right now that says no signal um now it's worrying and um it's loading the uh one of the disks that I used to um that I was using when um I'm sorry I'm like uh I lost lost my train of thought uh that should be the other one of the other coding train sayings um I hear it a little but it's fine says the zad gaming um it's loading a disk sorry so it's loading a disk and I can type catalog and there's a bunch of things on this disk this is like a DOS uh 3.3 sample disk um and I think my Vandal brought program is on this one yeah that's what I was using this for so if I load the mandelbrot program in basic I can look at the code and you can see this is the code oh this is not the final code this is one I wonder which one this is this is not the final code that I wrote for um I don't think yeah this is one it's good this is one I did a couple different ones this is one that's drawing a random Dot and coloring it according to the Mandel brought set I can't see it at all you can definitely hear it says bon bon um Let's uh so I'm curious does do you see I don't see on this monitor I don't see any color I should probably hook my phone up to OBS so I can have a roaming camera here because you probably can't really see what's on this monitor obviously you can see the output of it you're sort of seeing the from the side um but is this are are we using different colored dots that if they kept going would maybe make the mandelbot set not too disturbing that okay I mean I kind of wanted but the dogs are going great is Ness is that for real Ness writes I can't hear it but the dogs are going crazy um okay um I I got I gotta yes we see colorful dots so I would love to let this run for a while but we won't get anywhere if we do so um let's see what else is on this whoops let's see what else is on this disc Apple Vision animals oh into basic FB basic color test Breakout let's try brick out come on brick out you can load by the way did you know see if I can find it did you know that um when I first got the Apple II plus I would load games off of a cassette tape so I had literally a cassette tape not a disk drive and this is one of those original cassette tapes I have no way of accessing the data on it it says micro computer games 1980 a division of the Avalon Hill Gameco I don't I should probably set the camera to autofocus and then I could put this up real close but the focus is locked right now on the Apple II computer um but this is pretty wild Planet miners because maybe this game programs trs80 Apple II okay so oh I loaded brick out one of the things that's wonderful I mean this is just not the case for computers today it's like oh I want to play the Breakout game I got it on this disc I can look at all of the source code for Brick out like this is all of the source code for the Breakout game and I could just edit it right here so loading the game is not loading some binary executable compiled file that's proprietary that's going to have inapp purchases and all that nonsense it's literally oh I don't know what just happened there uh cassette tapes were the norm in Europe floppy disks were mostly a us thing that's interesting from Stig um what songs so I don't know what just happened here I think it crashed I'm hoping I I guess I'm gonna um well I was gonna play brick out but let's move on to the Oregon Trail so what I need to do on the floppy emo and I'm sorry that you can't see this if you watch my video I show closeups of how this works is I am going to use there's a little tiny screen on this and I am going to navigate to find the Oregon Trail okay so I'm getting some comments about the high pitched noise so I'm gonna go work on that uh in a in a moment thank you for your comment where is Oregon Trail Frogger Moon Patrol Oregon Trail one organ Trail two so um while this loads I'm gonna restart the computer and I'm going to load the Oregon Trail game uh if anybody knows how to apply a low pass filter in obs put that information in the chat I'm assuming this is just taking a while to load um Johan asks about the Apple II I kind of talked about that earlier in the live stream but the short answer is yes this is my childhood Apple II plus computer so I'm over here by the you won't probably hear the highpitched sound anymore because I've moved um but I'm going to look under the mic and I'm going to go to filters and I'm going to add a compressor expander game noise suppression Noise Gate which one do I do does anybody know I could Google this uh OBS low pass filter uh low pass VST plugin uh oh yeah btb um use the equalizer says slog sorry there's there's a this whole spam scam issue going on on YouTube there's a lot of uh impersonation of the coding train and if I will never um I will never uh be saying to contact me on telegram because you won something so it's not me um okay so I'm going to this we're going to learn how to do this uh filters and let's try uh vsd 2.x plugin please select a plugin I don't have any of those okay uh gain expander compressor Noise Gate noise suppression uh no so I have to install something there's no EQ natively oh there isn't I just assumed this was like an easy thing for me to do so I might not be able to do this so easily uh add I see compressor expander gain invert polarity limiter wouldn't the limiter maybe work Noise Gate noise suppression limiter threshold no that's release the limiter is going to make it so that I can't yell and have distorted sound noise suppression will work all right we'll try that I also have well now you can't hear it because I I'm like a good 15 to 20 feet away from the Apple II it's a big room uh so I think if I go sit next to it yeah I know you want to hear the keyboard um well I don't mind installing a plugin all right let's try the noise suppression and see what happens the noise suppression is now on um so I just turned noise suppression on and I'm going back I don't know why the Oregon Trail never loaded okay um claims to be reading from the disk still but do I need to like put in disk 2 now I swear I I did this earlier please insert side one of your organs discount okay let's see if this works uh I it's funny there must I must have it on a different disk because I swear I was I was running this all right so now we're loading disk one maybe it's going to tell ah there we go I knew that this worked okay it's worse now I can hear static I do have the Nvidia broadcast noise suppression all right I should add that that's what I should use I it's funny I have the and it is so hold on let me um let me fix this filters let me get rid of all these filters I totally forgot that I'm running Nvidia broadcast so I'm going to go to Nvidia broadcast and um noise level is now on the sad thing about this is I think it's going to cut out sound from the game but um Okay so what I would like to do as a project is I want to build a custom version of this game um and that is maybe coding train themed and also I have volunteered to create a version of this game for a podcast that's called renap Rob and Akiva need a podcast I'm sure the the crossover between coding trained viewers and renap listeners is you know uh the Venn diagram there is exactly one person in me the volume got a bit loud um so i i people people are telling me about the audio now but um so I'm trying to decide what to do I want to be able to have a way of making essentially like an Oregon Trail game the engine for the game that maybe there's like a Json file that has all the scripted data in it so as much as I would love to like do a video where I sort of like build and program this game in uh applesauce basic I think I just want to understand and look at the basic code for this game and then make a p5.js version of it um so um so let's try the game for a little bit so uh should we learn about the trail should we see the Oregon top 10 um should we just jump on in let's Jump On In and travel the trail okay many kinds of people made the trip to Oregon you may be a banker from Boston a carpenter from Ohio a farmer from Illinois find out the difference between these choices let's find out the difference you're a banker you have more money for supplies uh farmer of the greatest number of points Banker earns the least be a banker from Boston and Carpenter oh I'm back here what do we think anybody got a uh anybody got a version yeah I'm pretty sure uh yeah the sort of meme I guess the uh the sort of known uh thing is um yeah I don't know what's going on with these uh scam uh accounts on um YouTube farmer okay I'm I'm gonna go with Alf Alf says be a farmer all right we're gonna be a farmer Banker is the easiest boy I love I love the Oregon Trail knowledge here everyone's saying one okay fine I'm gonna go with the people who is the first name of the wagon leader I guess it's me choo choo who are the first names of the four other members of your party this stop refactor D5 oh it won't let me have a five P5 j s and um processing oh no processing are these names correct yes okay so first of all a lot of potential for these graphics it is 1848 you're jumping off place for Oregon as Independence Missouri you must decide which month to leave Independence all right I'm going to ask for advice while wait for the chat to uh I guess I could run polls like I should just quickly run polls uh month March April May June oh July is not an option it only lets me have four choices June or July uh okay um April see some votes for April April is leading let's ask for advice you attend a public meeting held for folks with the California Oregon forever fever sorry folks with the California organ fee are told if you leave too early there won't be any grass or oxen to eat if you leave too late you may not get to Oregon before winter comes leave it just the right time there will be green grass whether it be cold well seems like we want to leave in May but everyone's saying April so I'll go with April okay we're ending that poll floral you should buy equipment and supplies you have sixteen hundred dollars in cash but you don't have to spend it all now you can buy whatever you need at Matt's General Store it is the aura ring uh make asks I'm sorry that I'm not seeing the Q a right now it's kind of a fail here um hello I'm Matt let's if we could slow down on the discussion about whether accounts are scam accounts or not scam accounts I have no idea I I was only addressing the fact that um there it there are uh yeah there are um I noticed that there are some accounts called the coding train that are using my profile picture that are uh replying to people's comments on YouTube I've been trying to block them like I have a block for the word telegram right now but then they're using like yeah yeah so the primer is exactly right if if you hear from primer or the coating drain or anyone who is maybe a channel your follow and they're asking you to DM them message them on WhatsApp or telegram that you've won something please ignore those messages they are scams uh primer with a check mark looks like the legit primer to me I have no idea if it's possible to impersonate the check mark on YouTube we all know where things have gone awry recently with the check marks okay uh and uh whether or not it's the real primer which I'm assuming it is incredible Channel with amazing uh animations and cool interactive systems so great okay uh we're gonna need a team of oxen and clothing plenty of food ammunition oh I don't like that spare parts for your wagon uh all right so which item would you like to buy oxen two oxen and a yolk I recommend at least three yolk sticks some food I recommend you take at least 200 pounds of food for each person we have five people so I need a thousand pounds of food 20 cents a pound right let's get some extra clothing I need warm clothing recommend at least two sets of clothes per person each set is ten dollars five people ten sets hundred dollars say 15 sets ammunition I don't want any ammunition can I get no ammunition I'll just get one box just in case uh spare parts uh it's a good idea to have a few spare parts for Your Wagon here are the prices how many wagon wheels five three okay well then three five okay and three five then three okay uh should I save money uh uh should I save money or should I I think I should save money right I'm Gonna Keep Going let's get extra food food won't go will the food go bad since I'm kind of not using the ammunition um let's get another 400 pounds of food and oh oh no no no it changed it's not added it's not adding it up that's confusing so uh 2 000 pounds okay remember to get toilet paper I don't see that on the list but it would be nice all right let's keep going ready to start good luck I have a long and difficult journey ahead now loading the wagon let me get my coffee I forgot to bring it with me over here by the way is the um highpitched wine gone now oh you probably can't hear the music can you hear the music the noise suppression is probably cutting out the music that's sad okay okay the weather is cool the health is good the pace is steady the rations are filling well let's look at the map whoa that is wild I love that map okay we gotta make it let's press the space bar to continue let's continue on the trail okay no music all right we gotta turn off sorry it's required that I turn off the nose noise suppression okay we're turning off the noise suppression foreign uh turn to size up the situation continue on the trail check supplies look at the map change pace and we're doing well we should go faster right strenuous pace we're going to go to a strenuous pace uh let's continue on the trail um this dot has cholera oh no it's done it's cholera oh my God we've gotta I've got to do something about that okay no no wait let me do something yes I want to look around we gotta gotta help this dot I don't want this dot anything to happen to this Dot okay uh uh what are we gonna do what are we gonna do about this here stop to rest let's stop to rest will that help maybe let me check the supplies that oxen got closed got that little bit of ammunition that I was forced to buy plenty of food money left okay we better stop to rest uh uh how many days should we rest one let's rest two days I don't know check supplies look at them now let's look at the map let's see where we are boat so looks like we've gotten about this far I thought we would maybe be farther um okay um two check supplies okay wait two days um so let's continue on the trail maybe we should change the pace could we keep it strenuous health is good rations are filling weather is warm let's continue on the trail you must cross the river in order to continue the river at this point is currently 625 feet across and 4.3 feet deep in the middle you may all right I'm gonna need help for this one attempt to Ford the river wagon and float it across take a ferry across wait to see if conditions improve get more information well I don't mind getting more information Ford a river I was going to ask what is Florida River I'm glad they're explaining it means to pull your wagon across a shallow part of the river with the ox still attached so that would have been my guess I was assuming forwarding a river is like basically walking across the river the wagon means to seal it um so that I understood that when we float across like a boat top of a flat boat belongs to someone else I mean I think we have enough money we should do the ferry right Ferry Max bitker hi Max says the ferry okay we're doing the ferry five dollars wait five days so five dollars is definitely no problem is the waiting five days a problem I really don't want anyone to get hurt let's wait we'll go to strenuous pace okay we're waiting oh my goodness we left in April so we have lots of time are we gonna make it there by I I only have I have a meeting at noon so and I wanted to start working on this project but oh look at that oh my goodness here we go going across the ferry this is awesome foreign safely across 83 miles to the blue Big Blue River Crossing okay we're about to get to another River well weather is good health is good weather is cool yes yes all right we're at another river crossing here yeah I gotta for the river before my noon meeting I got a zoom meeting at noon I gotta make it to work and before then that's where my internet connection is for my zoom meeting okay uh weather's cool health is good pace is strenuous the rations are filling we're doing well people continue on the trail sure I mean everything seems good we we waited a bit I mean check let me check our supplies oxen clothing bullets again not so happy about having the bullets plenty of extra stuff lots of food all right continue on the trail we're gonna have to cross the river right are we going to forward the river the river is currently oh this doesn't seem so bad I don't know that we need a ferry for this one right it's only 2.4 feet deep in the middle 230 feet across I think we could attempt for the rip it's not even giving me a fairy option here let's I mean I know what all these things are we'll we'll get more information I don't we I don't think we need the conditions to improve right I don't think we need to can should we should we forward or caulk yeah if only Oregon was real there was really a place called Oregon the Dreamland we could all travel there and be together happy The Way We Were Meant To Be I don't know what voice I'm using there uh so should I make another poll people are telling me one let's do we got a little time here let's do a poll uh Ford caulk or wait wait wait wait wait wait I don't know where um Somewhere in Brooklyn there's a Crossing that makes that sound which is great because it makes it accessible and um my daughter and I have this joke where if like uh she wants me to stop or I want her to like stop and wait we just I just wait wait wait um oh I should have entered the poll I was I was wasting time so you could vote and then I forgot to hit add pull no ask your community get rid of this ask your community sorry about that the poll is going live now uh so I'm gonna give it a minute here um algeros this is the original Oregon Trail game I wanted to play it through to have a sense of how it works and then at some point start programming it apparently not in today's live stream um so everyone is saying Ford it's a pretty pretty clear Ford so we're gonna afford it okay here we go I'm gonna end that poll thank you everyone who voted uh okay here we go we're crossing cross I become stuck in the mud we lost a day that's not good but we lost five days when we took the ferry so that seems not so bad oh my goodness the Big Blue River let's keep going let's keep going we've got plenty of food return I'm just gonna keep going oh it's hot that's bad warm you pass a grave site I mean I suppose to honor the grave site we should say yes I would think here lies Andy pepperoni and cheese what is this like somebody who played the game before who like entered their information and misspelled pepperoni and cheese and what is going on here it's very strange I guess that's like somebody who played the game before who died there we'll be able to say here lies hopefully not this Dot okay Fort Kearney sure let's look around weather is hot the health is good the pace is strenuous the rations are filling uh could you on the trail look at map change Pace I think we're in good shape let's just keep going right weather is hot the disc had those previous people yeah so wherever this disc came from this is not my this is came with the um floppy emu so this is one of the I didn't load this from another source um so whatever version they were using um so I'm P0 ask how is the YouTube stream colorful on the Apple screen green this is a monochrome monitor it cannot show color and so it takes the analog video output and shows it without color and the capture card on my you know 2022 Windows computer can take color and the color signal that's going out is being converted into HDMI uh let's continue on the trail oh there's a joke about Tombstone Pizza okay 250 miles to Chimney Rock let's keep I'm worried that it's hot we should look at the map probably soon but I'm trying to get there before before my meeting a thief comes and stealing the night and steals 61 pounds of food I think we're okay leave a live I got a lot of extra food health is fair okay hold on size up the situation I'm a little worried about her health here uh let's look at the map see where we are okay we're moving along we're not even halfway there though uh check the supplies should I rest plenty of stuff here I should rest right increase the pace yeah I'm gonna increase the pace good good idea so let's rest for two days and then change the pace we're going to go to a grueling pace and continue on the trail Chimney Rock I mean should I stop looking around at every stop weather's cool health is fair oh okay I I kind of continue on the trail I don't need to look around all right yeah let's go Fort Laramie come on no no no no just go grueling pace uh please flip the discount aside too okay by the way there's a small chance this is now going to be the end of lengthy Orchid Trail because I have no idea if the emulator is gonna work with flipping the disc and reloading it but um that's fine if it doesn't uh because then we can switch over to thinking about how we might do this uh with P5 or as a browser based thing or we can maybe look at the code for it so I need to press eject disk okay then I need to go to Apple 2 stuff five and a quarter inch disk games and now I'm going to Oregon Trail 2. I've loaded that so it's loaded in there I should be able to press spacebar to continue it's working yeah it's loading from the disk amazing uh I I'm going to say no I don't want to look around it's time to go we don't we don't got all day here yeah the music is so great but go at your grueling pace inadequate grass that doesn't sound good inadequate grass what does that mean this grass this grass is inadequate only adequate grass from here on out bad water health is poor okay okay yes we need to look around our health is poor and so uh uh we're going to well what's happening with the food rations filling no I want it to be filling yeah we're not changing the food rations we are I guess we have to stop to rest let's stop to rest three days I don't care if it takes a lot of time I just want the real time of playing the game to go quickly okay uh the health is fair again should I rest more let's see if we rest more while I get my health to be good health is still Fair all right we gotta go we gotta go people go on that grueling Pace yep yep yep moving along 102 miles keep going thank you uh coding Garden for helping moderate the chat um lose Trail lose four days come on people keep going yes and let's keep the chat on topic and that topic is the Oregon Trail can we get gaming live streams on the Apple II that's basically what this is uh uh I don't want to look around no keep going although I love seeing all the trail divides here oh see the map okay so uh we're gonna need another poll here um start a poll I forgot what they were already so it's unclear to me what I'm looking at in terms of where I want to switch but uh Green River Green River or fort Bridger I guess it's a matter of do we want to cross a river maybe the river is faster but you have to deal with the risk of crossing the river I'm gonna go for the river then I'm putting a poll up I'm going to look at the map again because I don't actually see um they don't actually see he which is the like oh I see like it's like going directly across the river versus going to this fort maybe it's faster I don't know it's not really giving me a lot of information um is the pole uh 62 right now for Green River all right we don't got a lot of time so I'm going with the people Green River all right moving along very little water like I'm out of water oh no one of the oxen is injured find wild fruit I found wild fruit I love wild fruit okay and Green River would you like to look around yeah no I knew I might just want to cross the river I don't want to look around yeah okay here we go what are we gonna do 400 feet of course 20 feet deep in the middle we will not be forwarding this River uh definitely taking a ferry let's just let's just go for the ferry five dollars four day only four days I've been waiting five days last time and plus I get to rest don't I get to rest those four days yeah let's do it oh we end this one uh Deanna Lim is asking I wonder what algorithms are for deciding whether a bad thing happens I'm assuming it's just like a random number generator okay we're Green River Crossing let's go don't get stuck in the mud Ferry got across amazing we got to keep going though 140 four miles to Soda Springs let's go this grueling Pace 11 35 bad water bad water bad uh four and everything fine oh more wild fruit keep going I love wild fruit pad water well health is Poor Boy the oxygen died I should probably stop let's stop and rest the health is poor nah it hasn't told me anybody's uh yeah let's look at Soda Springs we'll stop we gotta look around here okay um uh check supplies oxen we have plenty of extra oxen I guess still plenty of pounds of food we have money left um stop your rest two days health is fair continue on the trail okay all right keep going we lost two days it's June already this is bad uh no we're going to continue very little water no no no no no there's a lot of forts I don't need to see all of them all right we're going to Snake River Crossing people get ready for another ferry ride and maybe we'll this time let's the wagon it's hot the health is poor very little water but bad water we got water problems this dot has measles it's always this Dot this dot is getting sick all the time that poor poor little this style is so frail take care of this Dot I mean we should rest right but let's get to the river first ah these thieves are always stealing our food and The Grass Is Always inadequate there's nothing I hate more than inadequate grass I'm I'm okay you are now at the Snake River Crossing yeah actually I don't want to look around I just want to go across across the river um there's some I think this game is a little bit dated to say the least um uh uh it doesn't doesn't hold up uh let's see what am I looking for continue on the trail health is very poor but we might get to rest if we're going to take a ferry a thousand feet across six feet deep in the middle six feet isn't insane we could caulk um um let's try caulking the wagon it's gonna be a disaster oh we're so close to the end I had no trouble genius it's very hot and very poor all right we should rest right oh processing as me as well so no okay okay we gotta rest we gotta rest processing and this dot are both quite sick let's stop to rest I don't got a lot of time to rest one day Hey Kevin Schroder thank you so much for joining and the support continue on the trail um an adequate grass the health is poor not very poor we've improved our health we have very little water which is worse than little on the oxygen is injured inadequate grass when are we going to get some adequate grass in this uh on this Trail no I don't want to look around I have like 10 minutes I do want to look at the map I want to see how it's July already I think it's getting kind of too late like we're supposed to get there sooner rough trail health is very poor again health is poor this dot has cholera this dot is really keeps getting cholera very poor but it's we don't have time here we can't rest no I don't all right let's find let's look around Blue Mountain sounds lovely uh the Blue Mountains uh look at the map oh we are so close there uh maybe we can rest one day let's rest one day and let's check the supplies do I still have food pounds of food left 450 pounds of food that seems good let's go we're so close uh head to Fort Walla Walla head for the which one do we want to do uh Fort Wala Walla or what was the other one other one I don't remember what it was uh oh we don't want to go to the Fort we don't want to go to the Fort that looks out of the way the other one is the dollies The Dales um oh I can't start even in July I guess I'm doing fine on time people are saying to go to Fort Walla Walla shouldn't I go the other way all right oh I think I put my thumb on the scale there uh all right I'm gonna give it another uh 20 seconds oh oh no it's it's a tie it's a tie I think I put my thumb on the scale drop this all right okay now other one other one in other words The Dales uh is uh is winning out don't don't listen to me stick with your heart if you believe in Fort Walla Walla vote for Walla Walla it's pronounced the dolls thank you DJ Mangus all right the dolls is clearly winning right now and by clearly I mean by six points 53 to 47 I don't somebody called Nate silver to tell me if uh if if I've got a good enough sample size all right we're going for the dolls so it doesn't look like I'm going to get to coding this um this spot dot has a snake bite oh my goodness this dot is cursed pour this Dot this dot is really suffering this dot has had cholera twice measles and a snake bite nobody else is having these kind of issues this dot has died foreign I wish I had my like if I had my like sound effects I would do a eulogy we should we should say eulogy for this dot this dot you always stayed with us we never forgot you you always helped us with our properties in our classes or bouncing balls would never have bounced without this Dot our particle systems would not be systems or particles without this dot thank you for your service this Dot you will always be remembered I'm at the dolls no going there for this Dot we will make it there no we're almost pace for this Dot float down the Columbia River yeah float down the river here we go I don't have a lot of time left here uh we're gonna float down the river our Rivers have never steered us wrong the rivers have worked for us the dolls will always fill my heart with memories of this dot use the arrow keys to guide your raft oh my God this is exciting okay everybody you ready for this after passing the third Direction sign lanyard raft at the trail to the Willamette Valley okay oh my God what okay all right oh okay here we go come on I'm so scared wait move out of the way of that rock Iceberg ahead okay we're good we're good we're good we're good oh my goodness so we definitely want to add some mini games in wait is that where I need to land is that where I need to land uhoh I'm so confused did I miss it or is that just that didn't look very like the landing I'm just gonna keep going after the third sign okay I wasn't paying a tough to close enough attention so that was the first sign that's the second sign these are arrows telling me to keep going keep going okay okay unfortunately the chat you're like 30 seconds behind me so no no wrong way I got to stay on this side I'm assuming oh no oh no there's a rock coming up this is going to be quite the maneuver wait but that's the third side no wrong way no go back okay okay which way oh that's the trail which way that's the trail this way is the trail no this way go this way did I make it was I one moment please one moment and Bingo was his nameo the dog and Bingo was his nameo congratulations you have made it to Oregon and only one person died it wasn't really a person it was like a DOT that's part of the code it's like a like a character what ASCII value they're fine P5 survived processing survived we'll be fine we're fine four people are very poor health one wagon 11 oxen nine square Parts 15 sets of clothing 20 bullets three and a 19. see I never used a single bullet this I am the most proud of I should never have bought those bullets in the first place foreign it's Willamette Willamette sorry what was I saying uh uh all right uh 392 pounds of food and to see if we qualify for the Oregon top ten please flip your discount to the side okay uh uh okay going to uh uh Oregon Trail Disc One there we go um all right press spacebar to continue are we gonna be in the top ten that is the real question yes I don't know who these people are all right Stephen Meek David Hastings Andrew Sublette selinda Hines Ezra Meeker Richard Escobar we're coming for you William Vaughn Richard Escobar we I've made it into is that eighth place one two three four five six seven eight Ninth Place right it's the top ten and that's the spot before 10. which would be nine um the coding train no no all right fine coding train horn all right would you like to make any changes no I am forever inscribed into this Oregon Trail top 10. now I will just now connect to the internet to post a tweet to tweet about my high score all right um by the way let's look at the learn about the trail try taking a journey cover wagon across 2000 miles of plains ribs and mountains to try on the planes across the rivers you money might take a ferry you can board the river about supplies the all right so I think we've seen ah you can use these monitors you use these colors to adjust your monitor or television so this was a thing that you had to calibrate so the uh you know when you if you had one of these Apple twos and one of the monochrome monitors you could hook it up to your color television set and then depending on the dot and using the dials on the back of the television in fact I have a color monitor here foreign so we could see I think I think this one is a color monitor it might not be this is a Apple monitor Cupertino California model g099os um yeah I thought there were maybe this one isn't colored does it say anybody recognize anybody recognize this monitor I have another one also that was definitely color this one might be monochrome um somewhere around here I have uh oh yeah it's underneath here so there's definitely a color on there anyway we don't need to go into that but I'm just curious let me I have to go look I have to go peek because I can't see what it's outputting orange green blue violet oh yeah looks pretty good all right control s that's how I could have changed the sound and all right so I'm gonna uh stop now I'm going to turn off the monitor and the computer because it is 11.50 and I have run out of time so I'm going to come back to my regular streaming setup and kind of talk about what's next here because um let's see if my soundboard charged so I can play some outro music totally did not um totally did not uh all right so let me come back to here I don't know what's going on with um I don't know what's going on with that iPad that I use for sound um okay uh let me tell let me check the Q a uh oh no so live chat questions would you make river crossing a challenge for the player in the remake so I'm I'm kind of not sure what to do here so let me actually just go look really quickly I think in one of these emulators I only have a few minutes here but let's just check this one so game this emulator I think has the Oregon Trail game uh here it is okay so I'm gonna do open so um in this emulator now I can power cycle so if you want to do this yourself you could use this emulator you could sort of follow along with what I'm doing and um what is going on here this is a different version of it maybe I love this wacky animation here foreign for this I wanted to see if I could take a look at the Oregon Trail code um oh my goodness I think I'm just going to control C this let's see if we can look at the disk organ Trail it's got a lot of other things on it too see if I can load it there's a fly buzzing around me okay um yeah so I'm pretty sure we are now looking at the entire source code of the Oregon Trail game um not entirely sure obviously I can't really tell and there's a lot of Peaks and so I don't I'm a little skeptical there that doesn't seem like I don't understand where all of the data was coming from for the game if I run this this is like totally a different version of it interesting this is like a different version of the game but um so hold on so uh let's look one more place that I'm curious about um can't remember or if Oregon Trail is here text Adventure there's this text Adventure which is a different one that's fun um other thought I saw it here but I guess not Tech that was a text only one I really like the graphics one so this looks like could it be um yeah this looks like this is the text only one that we were just looking at so it's sort of interesting to see anyway I I don't need to sort this out so my question is how do I want to create a version of this in P5 and I think right now what I'm going to do because I literally have just I have negative time left because I really meant to leave six minutes ago is I'm going to create a new repo and I'm sure this exists already so there's a question in my mind of should I just adapt an existing code base or emulator um or should we totally rebuild build it from scratch but Oregon Trail um emulator and emulator is kind of wrong I'm just gonna say let's call it the I mean I think I want to make it a direct Port of exactly what I just played maybe you know removing some of the culturally insensitive Parts about it um or it could just like build a version of it that's just straight starting with like sort of coding train themes um the Oregon Trail so but I'm just going to call this repo Oregon Trail and how to read me and if people have some ideas or proposals for how to get started with this and you want to contribute to it I mean I'm going to come back and stream about it maybe I'll make a video about it um maybe this weekend I'll just turn on the streaming again uh what I would suggest is uh file some issues because if you want to participate in this file an issue to raise your hand to offer an idea I'll try to if I have time today start building this out in some way um and we should see um call it the coding Trail yes so that would have made sense so I but I've got to run um thank you again to um uh curiosity streams for sponsoring if you missed my uh if you missed my whole spiel about the nebula class what is code um you can uh go back to the archive of this and watch about it but the this is now um uh you could sign up directly but uh for uh um for uh nebula and you will have access to the nebula class but the price hack that I'm offering you is to get the Curiosity stream bundle which gets you curiosity stream plus nebula for 14.79 and then for one dollar a month more or five dollars for the whole year you have access to all of nebula classes um and um thank you coding Garden for for posting all these links um I don't know what I'm doing next I really gotta work on the nature of code book I have made a lot of progress but I'm behind still so that's kind of my reason for not streaming so much but I would feel better about saying that if I had made more progress but maybe I'm just too hard on myself but I am the nature of code book I am deep and working on you can follow it at um it's on GitHub you can find it join the Discord I'm tired uh check out the shorts uh check out all the stuff that I talked about before I've got to go I'm gonna put the goodbye screen on but I have no music so I will sing it I
