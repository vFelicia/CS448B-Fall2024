00:00 - [Music]
00:01 - hello welcome to the coding train Oh is
00:06 - everybody doing today I have to say I
00:08 - have a lot of dirt on my glasses there's
00:11 - really a problem and I really should
00:13 - clean it because I would like to be able
00:14 - to see you with my clear vision
00:17 - interestingly enough you appear to be
00:20 - this round circular thing it's actually
00:27 - well I'm sorry this is my practice I'm
00:29 - testing the audio I'm actually live
00:32 - streaming today's Friday that means it's
00:36 - time for the coding train with me dan
00:38 - Schiffman the one problem I have this
00:41 - week is it's like it's like my time
00:44 - zones like 4 o'clock it's gonna be 5
00:47 - o'clock in an hour it's been a very long
00:49 - week this was the first week of the NYU
00:52 - semester New York University to school
00:55 - the arts ITP as a place where I teach
00:56 - full time and that means I was very busy
01:01 - this week in fact had a makeup class
01:05 - today meaning I had to teach a class
01:07 - this afternoon for about 3 hours so I'm
01:10 - feeling a little bit lethargic I also I
01:13 - can hear there's a class going on in the
01:15 - room next door and I sometimes make a
01:18 - little bit too much noise in here and
01:20 - get a little silly I don't want to
01:22 - disturb them I think it ends in 15
01:24 - minutes though I'm I'm kind of you know
01:27 - just here taking deep breaths trying to
01:30 - get my energy going but welcome thank
01:35 - you for tuning in so as you if you've
01:37 - been watching the last several Friday
01:39 - live streams I have been struggling and
01:42 - doing my best and working through this
01:45 - playlist of video tutorials building a
01:48 - simple neural network library in
01:51 - JavaScript why I have no idea I am
01:54 - repeating not nearly as well the work
01:57 - done by many people countless times
01:59 - before me but I am trying to wrap my
02:01 - head around the idea of the inner
02:02 - workings of a neural network system what
02:05 - it a little bit about just sort of
02:06 - making a simple library and with the
02:09 - goal of once I have that done a couple
02:11 - of
02:11 - different things number one is starting
02:14 - to apply those same concepts but with a
02:17 - more robust framework namely a framework
02:19 - called deep learning is deep learn
02:21 - Janice Organa go check that out I will
02:23 - be getting to that very soon in future
02:25 - videos and my other goal wait did I have
02:29 - I said well that was the goal
02:30 - oh yes is to start doing some creative
02:34 - and interesting examples with with
02:37 - neural networks and genetic algorithms
02:38 - and just to eventually I mean I have
02:43 - this off I'm not going to show it but
02:45 - eventually I'm gonna get to that so
02:46 - that's certainly my main driving goal
02:49 - from now to the beginning of May when
02:53 - the semester then ends and then the
02:56 - summer happens I don't know break this
02:59 - elbow in June because this one's already
03:02 - broken it's now mostly healed anyway and
03:05 - then I don't know what I'm gonna do over
03:06 - the summer but I'll figure that out so
03:09 - here's the thing though this is a long
03:10 - week III one thing I have really
03:12 - discovered night I know I said this last
03:14 - week I'm gonna repeat it again
03:15 - I think there's pedagogical educational
03:20 - entertainment perhaps dare I say value
03:23 - in watching me make mistakes and have to
03:25 - debug and get frustrated and kind of go
03:26 - nuts that's my general mode of operating
03:31 - however it is seems that when I go
03:34 - through a particular math algorithm like
03:36 - gradient descent or matrix
03:39 - multiplication or back propagation if I
03:42 - get it all wrong it's not really that
03:43 - helpful so I have been doing some more
03:46 - readings more research some more
03:48 - practice with the next phase of the
03:51 - neural network library than building but
03:53 - I will not be getting to it today oh I
03:56 - just didn't have time this week I don't
03:57 - feel ready for it yet we're gonna take a
03:58 - break and I'm gonna try to do some fun I
04:06 - also think I'm you know I'm think I'm
04:08 - coming down with something it just sort
04:09 - of feels like you know that that feeling
04:12 - you get right before you're about to get
04:13 - a cold or a flu or something so I don't
04:15 - know I'm gonna I'm gonna work on a power
04:20 - throat I'm here for the for you
04:22 - the viewer of the coding train I thank
04:24 - you so much for tuning in and I'm gonna
04:27 - try to do some game stuff today what I
04:30 - started with actually was random walks
04:34 - because I taught my first class a class
04:37 - called nature of code where I go through
04:40 - a lot of the stuff in I'll just open
04:43 - this up here nature of code calm slash
04:46 - book and one of the very beginning
04:50 - pieces in the introduction is looking at
04:53 - random walks and I had this list
04:54 - somewhere of all sorts of variations of
05:00 - things you could do with a random walk
05:01 - like vary the probability of which
05:03 - direction or vary the length of the step
05:05 - or we get into 3d all these sort of
05:09 - different ideas and I was thinking I was
05:10 - gonna because the first day of class and
05:12 - that's kind of mine is there I was gonna
05:13 - start with that as my bunch of very and
05:19 - I have a coding challenge or random walk
05:20 - coding how I did a while back so we're
05:21 - gonna start with doing some variations
05:22 - of that then I was thinking about this
05:26 - presentation I saw over the weekend by
05:30 - another professor here at the game
05:32 - center Tisch School of the Arts game
05:33 - sundry if you did not know this there is
05:35 - a full and at BFA and MFA undergrad and
05:38 - graduate degree in game design that you
05:39 - can get Naomi
05:41 - Clarke gave a presentation and she
05:43 - talked a lot about snakes and ladders
05:44 - and Monte Carlo methods and was just
05:47 - like fascinating to me and I was
05:48 - thinking like I'm gonna program it
05:50 - snakes and ladders simulation which had
05:51 - already been suggested to me but it
05:53 - didn't come clear to my head so that's
05:54 - one thing I list and then loyal viewer
05:57 - Simon who I always like to refer to
05:59 - reminded me that 2048 has been a
06:03 - suggestion for quite a while in the
06:05 - rainbow topics repository and I always
06:11 - look at it I think like oh that's gonna
06:12 - be too hard today I was like a lecture
06:15 - look at that game I played it before we
06:16 - go
06:19 - baby maybe do it probably run into lots
06:22 - of problems would probably take too much
06:23 - longer than I think and I'll get stuck
06:25 - but I think I could do it so that's what
06:26 - I'm working with now those are my two
06:30 - ideas so I think what I'm going to do
06:33 - and I should say this is the other
06:36 - inviable I will make this up to you I
06:38 - mean in some ways I'm just here of my
06:41 - own volition but I do have a patron
06:43 - group thank you so much to the patrons
06:45 - of the coding train patreon.com slash
06:47 - coding train with membership you get a
06:50 - you can join our slack channel but I do
06:55 - today is gonna be a little bit shorter
06:57 - you have to be at a thing it sounds very
07:01 - cryptic a meeting an event downstairs
07:05 - I'm on the 9th floor I have to bend the
07:07 - fourth floor and 5:30 ish so I will try
07:09 - to make this up to you next week
07:11 - I won't usually be teaching on Friday
07:13 - like I was today so I usually will have
07:15 - the whole day and we can do some morning
07:16 - sessions which is better for a lot of
07:18 - the international viewers some you know
07:20 - I feel like this is like party time it's
07:21 - like Friday no I don't I don't I don't
07:27 - have party time I don't have party time
07:29 - my life but if I did I would do it at 4
07:31 - o'clock so that I could go to bed around
07:33 - like 5:30 or 5:45 because I really just
07:36 - anyway so it's gonna be a little shorter
07:45 - today so maybe maybe maybe maybe I could
07:49 - do both snakes and ladders and 2048 but
07:54 - just in case I cannot let's uh let's
07:58 - simon suggested i do a strawpoll which
08:00 - is my new thing that i like to do just
08:03 - to sort of get a sense here so pick one
08:07 - I don't if I put one first is that like
08:13 - strangely biasing you in some direction
08:16 - snakes and ladders 2048 well how
08:23 - comments no no no multiple option no no
08:26 - no prob okay Cray poll alright there's
08:29 - your URL
08:31 - somebody in the chat please who has
08:35 - moderator privileges please take that
08:37 - URL and paste it into the chat we will
08:39 - give the I will be giving you a minute
08:41 - or two here
08:44 - [Music]
08:50 - wake everything up oh the cameras are
08:53 - going up as you know the coding train is
09:07 - sponsored by water water what I do to
09:10 - drink it is put it in some sort of
09:13 - container and then take the container
09:17 - and I take it and I put it up to my
09:19 - mouth Thank You water for sponsoring
09:31 - the coding tree actually I'm sort of
09:33 - joking around but I do potentially I
09:35 - might be releasing a sponsored video
09:37 - soon I've not tried that before it's
09:39 - kind of a unique interesting experiment
09:40 - to try them excited about it stay tuned
09:43 - next week it might even happen I should
09:45 - say that sometimes another benefit of
09:47 - the Patriot herbal I have not done one
09:48 - of these recently is that sometimes if
09:50 - I'm testing something out or after you
09:51 - like a certain content that I'm not I I
09:54 - sent his wife I will lecture like
09:56 - smaller live streams for the patron
09:59 - audience its what had a few contracted
10:04 - yes that's the slogan right so the other
10:07 - nice thing about doing these I mean
10:08 - snakes and ladders has no strategy to it
10:11 - it's a purely random chance game there's
10:13 - gonna be drama and lots of suspense and
10:16 - excitement but there's no strategy
10:17 - whereas 2048 is a game that actually
10:20 - there's technique or strategy to play so
10:22 - I will want to revisit
10:24 - these to look at looking at different
10:27 - machine learning or algorithms to play
10:30 - the game automatically ok 24 8 is
10:33 - winning do people not know what these
10:38 - are
10:38 - I've let this straw poll on for way too
10:40 - long snakes and ladders if you live in
10:42 - the United States and you are I don't
10:45 - know of a certain generation this is
10:48 - universal enough but for me I know it is
10:50 - chutes and ladders but I believe the
10:52 - game originated in India and it was
10:56 - called snakes and ladders we can look at
10:58 - the Wikipedia page here is the Wikipedia
11:00 - page for the ancient Indian board game
11:03 - where you try to get up to the top and
11:05 - the snakes send you back down but the
11:07 - ladders allow you to get up faster and
11:09 - there's some interesting questions
11:11 - around interesting probability analysis
11:13 - stuff we can do around it and 2048 is a
11:18 - game that I believe here it is but I
11:20 - don't want to look at it on Wikipedia is
11:22 - a game that I believe a 19 year old put
11:25 - together in a weekend that it kind of
11:26 - went viral and it's based on many
11:30 - similar games previously what I
11:32 - understand it's a clone it's a very
11:36 - similar of cloning 3
11:38 - anyway
11:41 - 20:40 has been on so many times has it
11:44 - but I haven't done it oh now I'm like at
11:46 - the point where it's like is the world
11:49 - such that like there's so many coding
11:52 - tutorial videos everywhere the 2048 is
11:54 - like vishay alright alright alright
12:16 - alright I don't know oh oh I'm picking
12:18 - snakes and ladders that's all I have to
12:19 - say to you all
12:31 - he's no 2048 wow people really anti 2048
12:36 - I hate knowing it well why is it winning
12:38 - supposedly I feel that the coding Train
12:52 - merits more than 68 I mean on the one
12:58 - hand I should be like wow I mean I there
13:00 - was a time where I was like there were
13:02 - like 43 people watching the livestream I
13:05 - was like shocked by that so I was really
13:15 - just trying to pull you which to do
13:17 - first I my clan with snakes and ladders
13:19 - I don't know where I got this 2048
13:21 - thinking I thought everyone would be so
13:22 - excited okay okay okay okay hold on the
13:25 - chat it's interesting it seems like the
13:30 - numbers are in favor of 2048 but the the
13:33 - loudness of the anti 2488 crowd is very
13:37 - very really like resonating in my brain
13:40 - here alright Internet yeah snakes and
13:50 - ladders is catching up catching up let
13:55 - me just point out that if I go to
13:59 - rainbow topics Rose I'd caused such
14:06 - controversy look at this look at all
14:10 - this thumbs up here that's the most
14:12 - thumbs up I've ever seen in my
14:14 - repository look it keeps getting
14:19 - suggested and other issues have to be
14:21 - closed oh yeah I'm what about making it
14:29 - different like using three instead of
14:31 - two all right what
14:41 - all right we're gonna go I have a new
14:44 - method we're gonna go to the tried and
14:47 - true method which is so much better I
14:52 - don't like this voting thing this voting
14:54 - thing was a terrible idea
15:03 - okay are you ready for this now I will
15:09 - do whatever this says I will do whatever
15:14 - this says by the way I will do both of
15:16 - these eventually so even if I don't get
15:18 - to one of them today I will do it I will
15:21 - take it that snakes and ladders is very
15:25 - much desired okay this is very this is
15:33 - very scientifically Randa
15:42 - okay
15:44 - [Laughter]
15:54 - [Music]
16:04 - okay democracy dies in darkness indeed
16:11 - okay all is right with the world
16:20 - Wow
16:21 - the other thing though I was going to do
16:23 - to 2048 in processing and snakes and
16:26 - ladders in JavaScript so totally cheated
16:29 - no I by the way
16:31 - now I've just like nobody's happy a bit
16:33 - perfect I made it so that nobody in the
16:35 - chat is epic okay by the way I just want
16:45 - to point out that snakes and laughs is
16:49 - really catching up here you know I
16:56 - understand that I'm probably messing
16:59 - this up
16:59 - don't worry that this this is gonna be
17:01 - okay I'm sorry the loud voices got me
17:08 - worried okay okay sorry for the two or
17:17 - three of you who are now leaving
17:18 - livestream
17:19 - well come back another time I bought of
17:21 - these days I will actually use the straw
17:23 - poll it's kind of a pattern that I just
17:25 - take a temperature but that do whatever
17:27 - I I would have done if it had landed the
17:29 - random thing I I believe in randomness
17:31 - okay so I believe in randomness ah all
17:38 - right so let's go to desktop p5 I use
17:41 - the p5 manager to create a project which
17:44 - I totally don't remember what I think
17:47 - it's what does it generate G - B for
17:51 - bundle of snakes and snakes letters okay
17:58 - so CD snakes ladders I'm gonna run a
18:02 - server I am going to leave this
18:10 - Wikipedia page open I'm gonna go here
18:13 - I'm gonna open up the JavaScript console
18:17 - I'm gonna minimize the terminal I am
18:20 - going to maximize the maximize the
18:23 - terminal I'm gonna open up a code editor
18:26 - and we will be beginning all righty then
18:41 - 2048 snakes all right so let's do the
18:45 - little stupid things that I do for no
18:48 - good reason because I refuse to edit the
18:51 - template so that does it for me every
18:53 - time let's do it as a square maybe 500
18:59 - by 500 will work well and let's put a
19:08 - background in there so I can see that
19:10 - something's happening all right and
19:19 - how's that looking let's go a little bit
19:21 - whoops no let's go a little less here a
19:23 - little more console we all need a little
19:25 - more console in our life this is why I
19:27 - said I was gonna do this morning
19:31 - okay yeah okay that's the worst terminal
19:35 - I know I all my students they come they
19:38 - like open up their computers they've got
19:39 - fancy other applications for terminal
19:41 - everything's like color coded up the
19:44 - worst plain vanilla pathetic terminal I
19:47 - will say however that this is not my
19:50 - working login this is my streaming log I
19:54 - can have a few more things that make my
19:56 - terminal a little bit better when I log
19:59 - in as myself on the computer all right I
20:06 - mean thank our sponsor one more time h2o
20:17 - yeah we could get rid of this Thank You
20:19 - Alka hi by the way I'm really thinking
20:24 - of switching over to Firefox in my live
20:26 - streams I don't know why I'm just I'm
20:30 - thinking about it okay I better get
20:35 - started because I have to leave like an
20:36 - hour
20:36 - Thank You Damian I'm very sorry
20:40 - you are right to be a noise I would be
20:43 - totally to you it's absolutely a
20:45 - legitimate complaint that 2048 wasn't
20:47 - fall and now I'm not doing it I will I
20:49 - will deuce I will somehow justice will
20:53 - be served in its own way the universe
20:55 - will come become even at some point any
21:04 - chance you could use the debugger at
21:06 - some point during the challenge you mean
21:08 - like the chrome debugger or the
21:11 - processing debugger cuz I would yeah
21:15 - alright so let's think about this I
21:18 - don't really know actually the nice
21:20 - thing the fun thing about this challenge
21:21 - is I have no idea what I'm about to do I
21:23 - know this game let's make this a little
21:26 - wider
21:27 - come on Wikipedia oh okay no wonder oh I
21:32 - didn't realize I was like off the what
21:37 - is going on must have all of my windows
21:40 - exactly the way I like them this can go
21:44 - wide this can be here totally here no
21:46 - problem get a little more console okay
21:49 - there we go that's my warmup usually I
22:01 - do that before our livestream but for
22:02 - some reason today I thought I would show
22:03 - you a little like inside baseball
22:13 - hello I'm about to do a coding challenge
22:16 - that I am very excited about this is one
22:18 - of my favorite games it is called snakes
22:21 - and ladders it is an ancient board game
22:24 - created in India but is that correct
22:28 - I tried it again due to over I do over
22:34 - do over mimimi mimimi
22:37 - also I have this wire problem almost
22:40 - like tripped over this wire matrix of
22:43 - ten by ten hello it is me I'm going to
23:02 - do a coding challenge I'm actually quite
23:03 - excited about this coding challenge I'm
23:05 - going to attempt to make snakes and
23:06 - ladders a very well known ancient Indian
23:09 - video game I in this country of the
23:11 - United States where I live I am I know
23:13 - it it's chutes and ladders but I'm going
23:15 - to make snakes and ladders stay true to
23:17 - the original version of the game so I'm
23:20 - gonna do this with out a lot of like
23:22 - animation design I just want to get the
23:25 - mechanics of the game going and I want
23:27 - to think about some interesting
23:28 - properties of the game I saw a
23:30 - presentation by Naomi Clarke here at the
23:32 - game center about snakes and ladders and
23:35 - it got me thinking just about all sorts
23:38 - of stuff so maybe that stuff will come
23:40 - up as I try to make it now I'm gonna I'm
23:42 - gonna read this Wikipedia page to
23:45 - understand the game but I'm gonna try to
23:46 - diagram it first in my own way to see if
23:50 - we can think about how kind of data
23:51 - structures variables classes what kind
23:54 - of things we need to program it so the
23:55 - game is a simple game and let's actually
23:58 - start with it I'm gonna start and make a
24:00 - really simple version of the game it's
24:02 - called
24:02 - and because there are no snakes and
24:04 - there's no ladder so it's just and this
24:06 - is the game called and and let's make it
24:09 - four by four
24:11 - obviously the grid size the board
24:15 - there's so many ways that you could sort
24:17 - of consider the board but I'm gonna
24:18 - consider the board of the game to be a
24:19 - four by four grid and each spot is going
24:22 - to be a certain number
24:24 - and the numbers are gonna look like this
24:25 - I am cat whoops how about four by three
24:33 - so apparently for me to start three good
24:38 - lesson learn number one is that if I'm
24:41 - starting over here I want to end on this
24:43 - side of the board by wrapping around
24:45 - like this I can't have an even number of
24:47 - rows where's my eraser this is
24:52 - completely missing I think you could
24:55 - edit out be looking for the eraser ah
25:03 - found it okay so let me let's just look
25:07 - at it this way so the idea of the game
25:10 - is if I am a player I roll a die or
25:15 - maybe spin a wheel mean and maybe so
25:18 - maybe I get maybe I can move one two or
25:22 - three steps maybe there's just three
25:23 - possibilities so if I get a three I will
25:26 - go one two three and then if I get a two
25:29 - I will go one then I will be here if I
25:32 - get a one I'll move to here if I get
25:34 - another three I'll move to here another
25:36 - three over here forget a one once I
25:37 - reach here I win now I have a question
25:40 - do you have to roll the exact number to
25:43 - reach to win or you can you over roll
25:45 - the end well we can kind of make the
25:47 - game work either way so this is the
25:49 - basic mechanic of the game no strategy
25:50 - pure luck
25:52 - two players one goes first one goes
25:54 - second alternating turns revered it's
25:55 - the end first wins now there are snakes
25:57 - in their ladders but this basic idea
25:59 - let's first implement this and I'm going
26:02 - to talk about what makes it interesting
26:03 - once we kind of go past that now there's
26:09 - variety of different ways we could do
26:10 - this I think what I want is I want a
26:12 - player and a player just has a what's
26:18 - the what's the terminology for the spot
26:20 - that they're on I guess I'll just say a
26:22 - player has a spot that's the spot they
26:25 - sell the tile that they are currently on
26:27 - and then we have this idea of a tile
26:30 - which is each one of these and the tiles
26:33 - maybe just have which tile they're
26:37 - connected to
26:37 - next as well as perhaps an x and y
26:41 - location and a size like a width and a
26:43 - height for rendering them on the canvas
26:47 - or ever drawing graphic surface we're
26:48 - going to do I think that's enough
26:49 - description talking about the game I
26:51 - probably lost 80% of the viewers by now
26:54 - let's go over to try to dark coding some
26:56 - of this stuff okay
26:58 - oh yeah Here I am hmm okay I have no
27:07 - code I am using p5 GS library that's
27:09 - gonna help me with a lot of drawing
27:10 - stuff I've got a set function of draw
27:13 - function and I'm setting the background
27:14 - so let's first let's think about this
27:16 - I'm gonna actually make a couple other
27:18 - JavaScript files I'm gonna make one
27:20 - called tile Jas I'm gonna make one
27:25 - called a player is and I'm gonna use
27:28 - object-oriented programming
27:29 - yes six classes so I'm going to say a
27:31 - player when I make a player the player
27:37 - has a spot and the spot they're in is
27:40 - zero alright so that's the idea of a
27:43 - player now I'm gonna make the idea of a
27:46 - tile and what did I say a tile is going
27:51 - to have some x value where it is some Y
27:55 - value where it is and maybe the tile
27:58 - that it's the next one that you would
28:00 - walk to next so now and maybe it has a
28:03 - width and a height
28:04 - let's have everything be square so I'll
28:06 - just call it WH for square now what I'm
28:10 - going to do is here well that's like
28:14 - this 300 by 400 let's have the width be
28:18 - 300 and the height before with be 300
28:21 - the height be 400 this will kind of Oh
28:23 - with these would be 400 and the height
28:26 - should be 300 that allowed me have nice
28:28 - 100 by 100 tiles Oh Beverly I'm in a
28:30 - program this so you could just plug in
28:31 - any numbers and don't make a big
28:32 - complicated board but for right now
28:34 - let's start with it this way 400 comma
28:39 - 300 I'm quicker than this and now what I
28:42 - want to do is make some tiles so I'm
28:45 - gonna create a variable like I know that
28:47 - they're all gonna be a hundred by a
28:48 - hundred let's let's actually just make a
28:50 - variable called like resolution
28:51 - and I'm gonna call I'm gonna say that's
28:54 - 100 so we have the number of columns is
28:57 - the width divided by that resolution and
29:00 - the number of rows is the height divided
29:04 - by that resolution and I am also I need
29:10 - an array of tiles and eventually I'm
29:14 - going to need a player so I got an array
29:16 - of tiles and I've got a player I have
29:18 - the grid that I'm thinking of columns
29:19 - and rows but my tiles it's just gonna be
29:21 - an array so what I'm going to do is I'm
29:23 - gonna say for let I equals 0 I is less
29:26 - than columns times rows that's how many
29:29 - tiles columns times rows I plus plus I'm
29:33 - gonna try to get myself some more room
29:34 - to see the code and then what I'm gonna
29:38 - do I'm gonna make a new tile let tile be
29:41 - a new tile and I'm gonna give that tile
29:43 - I actually care right now I'm gonna just
29:45 - give it like arbitrary location like 100
29:49 - I have to think about the location in a
29:50 - second and then I'm going to say the
29:52 - next tile is I plus 1 so it gets a
29:55 - location and the next tile is the next
29:58 - one I plus 1 so I make this tile and
30:00 - maybe I give it its size is also that
30:04 - resolution variable let's make that
30:06 - resolution so the idea is now I go into
30:09 - my tile constructor I need an X a Y a
30:12 - size and the next tile so those are the
30:15 - arguments of the constructor every time
30:17 - I make a tile XY size and the next tile
30:26 - okay what what how am i doing is this
30:30 - gonna work I think it's gonna work now I
30:32 - really got to think though how do i hmm
30:35 - I have an idea why don't I what would
30:38 - make what would actually be a little bit
30:39 - better here is for me to think about how
30:43 - do I get that XY location so I know the
30:47 - first tile is down here right so how
30:52 - does that work the first tile the X is 0
30:55 - and the Y is the number of
31:00 - - one times that resolution right so
31:05 - that's where that starts and then each X
31:07 - just goes over a hundred more so let's
31:10 - try that so let's say the first tiles X
31:15 - is zero and the first tiles Y is the
31:21 - number of rows minus one times
31:24 - resolution and I'm going to then make
31:28 - the tile at that X&Y and by the way I'm
31:31 - a tile object I better do something with
31:34 - it so I'm going to once I make it put it
31:37 - in my array so I can access it later now
31:40 - once I make that first tile all I need
31:42 - to do is say hey x equals x plus
31:46 - resolution so the next tile is in the
31:51 - next spot right here now what happens
31:59 - when I get to here once I get past the
32:01 - width I need to move up and then start
32:05 - going that way hmm so I'm gonna need a
32:06 - direction that's keeping track of where
32:08 - I'm which way I'm going I'm just saying
32:10 - let Gir equal one so it's plus
32:13 - resolution times the direction and then
32:19 - when when when and by the way I'm sure
32:23 - there's lots of much more efficient ways
32:24 - of doing this it's like my caveat that I
32:26 - have to give constantly while I program
32:28 - terribly if X is greater than width or
32:33 - equal to if it gets to the end
32:35 - I don't want then what I need to do is
32:38 - say X minus equals resolution go back
32:41 - and say Y minus equals resolution so I
32:48 - want to move up and when we back and
32:52 - direction x equals negative one so now
32:57 - it'll what that's gonna do is this is
32:59 - gonna I'm gonna get to the end so I move
33:01 - back move up that's my next tile and
33:03 - then the next time I'm gonna start
33:05 - moving X this way so that if
33:11 - X is less than or equal to zero
33:14 - same thing I'm going to go pull plus the
33:17 - writ no I'm gonna stay I need to stay
33:20 - there because I'm doing this thing where
33:21 - I'm gonna be drawing the tiles from
33:23 - their left side that's why I'm gonna got
33:25 - to the end I just kind of slide back
33:26 - when I get to here though I'm fine right
33:28 - there
33:28 - x equals resolution Y goes up and
33:30 - direction switches so you know there's
33:34 - there's a nice way I could probably
33:35 - combine these if statements to one let's
33:37 - leave it like that for now I have no
33:39 - idea if this algorithm is right and what
33:41 - I'm going to do though to find out is
33:43 - just go and look at all the tiles and
33:46 - draw them so I'm gonna say tiles index
33:49 - i/o and I've been using my of loop let's
33:52 - use the of loop why not right so I'm
33:54 - gonna say for let tile of tiles and then
33:59 - tile dot you know render display and I
34:03 - let's let's call it render show as a
34:05 - show like show put it on the show its
34:08 - tiles tiles tiles you know anything I
34:11 - can do to somewhat tie myself to a
34:13 - musical theater I attempt to very poorly
34:15 - okay pause for a second this computer
34:19 - has gone to sleep
34:28 - yeah why modulus two could determine
34:32 - direction that's a good idea of somebody
34:35 - huh did I get it wrong that the game
34:38 - someone is saying the game starts at the
34:39 - on the right I've always thought of the
34:43 - game starting here but maybe that's the
34:45 - American version because we read from
34:47 - left to right but who knows yeah so so
34:59 - III I'm kind of breaking out for a
35:02 - second just to answer a question
35:03 - definitely starts and ends left so you
35:07 - mean it actually ends all the way over
35:09 - here so it doesn't end over here why did
35:13 - I think that I play by the way superhero
35:17 - chutes and ladders I've also played
35:19 - Peppa Pig chutes no Peppa Pig chutes and
35:21 - ladders is my favorite chutes and
35:22 - ladders sorry now I messed up for
35:27 - machiya because I went out of the video
35:29 - he made your bud that I looked at okay
35:31 - oh it does okay alright so matchy oh
35:37 - sorry all of that was edited and I'm
35:39 - gonna return back and just oh there's an
35:46 - edit point there because we're some nice
35:48 - comments from the chat pointing out that
35:49 - the actual original version of the game
35:51 - does in fact start here and end at the
35:55 - top a perfect square which so that's the
36:00 - actual version of the game I also got a
36:01 - good comment which what I could do is
36:03 - you said two loops for the columns and
36:05 - rows and then check if the Y is an odd
36:07 - or even row to like move this way or
36:10 - that way but I'm gonna leave my goofy
36:11 - system in there but I will actually have
36:13 - it end up there so it's I would you want
36:17 - to say that the the peppa pig version of
36:19 - chutes and ladders that i play quite
36:20 - often actually I think ends over here go
36:23 - check that tonight when I get home or
36:24 - I'll put something in the copy in the
36:26 - comment about the Peppa big chutes and
36:27 - ladders there will be wandering I'm sure
36:28 - okay so so here we go let's let's do
36:33 - this let's make it a square then let's
36:36 - call show and so now what I need to do
36:38 - is I need to write that function show
36:40 - and
36:40 - I'm gonna I'm gonna give each tile like
36:44 - a random color just so just so I can see
36:49 - them and I'm gonna say draw a rectangle
36:52 - at the x value of the Y value and that
36:55 - width and height and then I'm going to
36:59 - draw fill with this color okay so we
37:05 - should see point by weight what I just
37:09 - did here is kind of terrible I wrote so
37:11 - much code before I actually attempted to
37:14 - run any of it my advice that I would
37:16 - give anybody when I try to do is and I'm
37:18 - sorry for my green paper bleeding out
37:20 - there there is I should have I should
37:24 - have been testing stuff more frequently
37:26 - but here we go okay tile is not defined
37:29 - well why is tile not defined
37:31 - number one is I didn't bother to include
37:35 - in my HTML file the tile javascript file
37:39 - and or the player javascript file and I
37:42 - don't think the order really matters
37:43 - here but I want to put the player first
37:44 - in the tile second in the sketch last
37:46 - okay hey that looks pretty good let's
37:49 - write the numbers in of the next tile in
37:52 - the tile so let's say tech just for
37:56 - justice just for debugging text this dot
38:00 - next actually I kind of want to know its
38:04 - own index just out of curiosity right
38:07 - why not have the tile I don't know that
38:09 - I need this but I will kind of want to
38:13 - see I want to see this dot index and
38:20 - this dot next kind of in the tile and
38:23 - let's say text size 64 no text size like
38:29 - yeah 48:32
38:31 - and what am I looking for I need to give
38:34 - it an x and y location so I'll give it
38:36 - its X and it's Y location so I just want
38:38 - to see that this is working correctly
38:40 - and one undefined that's not good
38:44 - oh because what I forgot that I made I
38:49 - did this idea of having the tile know
38:50 - about its index but I didn't bother to
38:53 - pass in
38:53 - I 0 to 1 so why is only this one showing
39:00 - me oh because no y is only Y is only
39:18 - this one showing me the text so if we
39:22 - thought I mean I could use my matrix
39:26 - what did I do wrong here that I'm only
39:28 - seeing the text of one of them so let's
39:40 - look at the tiles this is there 16 of
39:42 - them these look like reasonable
39:44 - locations for them these look like
39:46 - reasonable index indices and next values
39:48 - so somehow might like fancy drawing for
39:52 - debugging has failed me
40:03 - so the first column is missing after the
40:12 - first row okay hold on
40:16 - is this Deepa interesting debugging or
40:18 - not interesting to you baby what is
40:22 - wrong here look at this there's some
40:25 - negative wise stuff that can't be right
40:28 - so why starts at zero 100 200 300 that's
40:32 - right 100 200 300 then this goes to 200
40:36 - the X is 300 200 100 uh-oh 1 there's no
40:40 - zero there so how come the zero oh I
40:43 - need to mm-hmm okay so my algorithm is
40:46 - wrong I had this like idea in my head
40:49 - that I was not going to get that my
40:52 - algorithm is just totally wrong because
40:55 - I want to basically what this should say
40:59 - is negative resolution right I'm in a
41:01 - place where I don't want to be if I gone
41:03 - all the way one off and then I do need
41:06 - to add back the resolution so actually
41:08 - this can be one let's make this one if
41:12 - statement if I'm at the either end then
41:16 - I should add the resolution times the
41:20 - direction times negative one then I mean
41:25 - I could change the direction first let's
41:27 - change the direction first then I could
41:29 - add the resolution times the direction
41:31 - and then go up a row and then I don't
41:33 - need this now let's try this okay I have
41:37 - them all there they look like they're in
41:38 - the right spot
41:39 - am I not draw oh you know why I'm not
41:42 - seeing them because I'm actually drawing
41:44 - the text at the top which is it's gonna
41:47 - appear but then the other one draws over
41:49 - it so for example what I want to do is
41:52 - say actually to draw the text at this
41:54 - dot why how come I can't get to this
41:56 - part of my code over to the right Oh cuz
42:00 - I moved it no oh yes what have I done
42:02 - this dot y plus resolution boy am I
42:06 - making this silly and complicated ah
42:09 - resolution is not defined why why is it
42:11 - not defined I believe it to be defined
42:13 - it is this dot wh resolution was the
42:16 - terrible that I used in my setup
42:18 - function the height the dimensions is
42:21 - called wh in the object okay there we go
42:24 - zero goes to 1 1 goes to 2 2 goes to 3 3
42:27 - goes to 4 4 goes by the way the reason
42:29 - why I'm doing this is because if it's a
42:30 - snake 4 is not going to go to 5 4 would
42:34 - go down to 2 so that's why I've set up
42:36 - this structure but at least I have all
42:38 - of them there and I have now the next
42:41 - things alright alright so we don't need
42:44 - this debugging stuff anymore and in fact
42:47 - what might be useful is actually to make
42:49 - it maybe I should just make it just so
42:51 - we can view it like a checkerboard
42:52 - pattern let's that might make it easy to
42:57 - see so what I could do is say here in
43:02 - the constructor if I modulus if index if
43:11 - it's an even 1 then make the color white
43:19 - otherwise this color equals black so now
43:23 - if I do that we see the nice little
43:26 - checkerboard pattern I'm not drawing the
43:28 - text anymore and there we go let's be a
43:32 - little less extreme about it and say 200
43:36 - and 100 there we go so this is now the
43:39 - board now I need a player I need a
43:46 - player I have a player object so I'm
43:49 - going to go to the sketch and I'm gonna
43:51 - say after I've set up the board player
43:54 - equals a new player then what can the
43:57 - player do the player can be seen the
44:02 - player can roll so the player can roll
44:07 - so what does the roll mean by roll I
44:09 - mean like roll a dice die or spin a
44:11 - wheel roll so I want to pick a random
44:13 - number and I'm gonna use the p5 random
44:16 - function to give me a random number
44:17 - between 1 and it is 0 an option in
44:21 - snakes and ladders what are the what are
44:22 - the actual roll possibilities one I'm
44:25 - just gonna say right now between 1 and 4
44:28 - I'm going to make that floor and I'm
44:31 - going to say this dot spot plus plus
44:35 - equals R then show is and I I guess what
44:40 - I want to do is I need to maybe if I
44:42 - give it the show function the array of
44:44 - tiles what I need to do is say current
44:47 - equals tile index this dot spot so I can
44:55 - look up where it is which tile and then
44:57 - maybe in that tile I can say draw an
45:01 - ellipse let's make an ellipse the player
45:04 - could have a color I'll just say white
45:05 - for right now let's draw an ellipse at
45:09 - maybe what I'll do is I'll write a
45:11 - little function that like equal tile get
45:14 - Center and it can give me like a little
45:17 - you can just give me a little array with
45:18 - the X and the y back of the center of
45:21 - the tile just so I can and so just you
45:23 - know why not let's write center here and
45:27 - I can say the center x equals this dot X
45:30 - plus this WH divided by 2 and the center
45:33 - Y is this dot Y and then return a little
45:38 - array with both those values in it could
45:41 - make a vector object or something I'm
45:43 - gonna call this get get center and then
45:46 - oh oh this might be a good opportunity
45:48 - to use like the es6 getters and setters
45:50 - who I'm not gonna bother come back to
45:54 - that sometime so then in the player I
45:57 - get the center and then I could say
45:59 - center 0 for X and Center 1 for Y and
46:04 - I'm gonna make a little nice little 32
46:07 - by 32 diameter little circle
46:10 - okay so tile is not defined in player
46:14 - dodge yes line 12 why is it not defined
46:17 - in player Dutch yes line 12 well because
46:20 - when in the sketch I call show I didn't
46:23 - pass it in the tiles and let's do this
46:26 - tile is not to find still in player j/s
46:30 - oh this is tiles thank you very much
46:35 - well how many times can I have tile not
46:37 - defined Oh current this is current get
46:40 - center
46:42 - now there we go oh look did you see that
46:44 - little you see a little game get played
46:46 - so now I need an any condition let's
46:49 - just say roll is rolling and moving so I
46:53 - should have a roll
46:55 - yeah it's probably a roll and then a
46:56 - move but uh maybe I'll separate those
46:58 - out later
46:59 - I need a condition for ending the game
47:01 - so maybe what I'll do is I will do that
47:05 - just out in the main program and I will
47:07 - say if player dot spot is greater than
47:16 - is greater than tiles dot length then
47:21 - are greater than or equal then not
47:24 - length minus one that's the last rater
47:26 - than or equal to right then the player
47:30 - is there at the end and I could make a
47:33 - more complex logic that you have to land
47:35 - on the last spot just go let you
47:36 - overshoot it equals that and console.log
47:41 - game over and I can say no loop all
47:48 - right I'm just gonna do that for right
47:49 - now yes I'm gonna change it to a 10 by
47:51 - 10 grid in a second all right so this is
47:53 - great so now the game is playing I could
47:56 - slow down the frame rate I could show
47:57 - what the role is so many things I could
47:59 - do to make this nicer let's at least
48:00 - make this 10 by 10 there we go so now
48:04 - we're watching the game being played a
48:06 - simulation of the game being played now
48:08 - here's the interesting thing what's
48:10 - interesting about snakes and ladders and
48:12 - the reason why it's is it kind of like
48:14 - relevant to a discussion of Montecarlo
48:21 - systems in this book is because and
48:26 - thank you again to name.we Clark at the
48:28 - game center for talking about this last
48:29 - weekend is that in this scenario we can
48:33 - actually write a mathematical formula to
48:35 - compute the mean average amount of rolls
48:39 - it would take to win the game let's at
48:41 - so we could do that right we could
48:43 - figure out like well if you can only
48:45 - roll a 1 2 or 3 and there's 16 spots for
48:49 - your average roll is a 2 so maybe
48:51 - that'll take
48:52 - maybe about eight eight rolls on average
48:56 - I think that's probably the appropriate
48:57 - mat I probably got it wrong you could
48:59 - fix me in the comments but the whole
49:02 - point of snakes and ladders is I could
49:04 - add a snake here I could add a ladder
49:06 - here this is going to increase the drama
49:09 - the fun of the game make it seem more
49:10 - complex but then there's not I mean try
49:14 - to come up with a formula that if you
49:17 - have a big complicated board lots of
49:18 - snakes and ladders that's gonna compute
49:20 - the average amount of rolls it takes to
49:22 - win the game
49:23 - not so easy however what I could do is
49:25 - just run the thing randomly hundreds of
49:27 - thousands of times or thousands of times
49:29 - or hundreds of times however many times
49:30 - I need and compute the average that way
49:32 - so that's what's known as kind of a
49:33 - Monte Carlo simulation and before by
49:36 - trying just running something through
49:37 - randomly making a lot of random
49:38 - selections before there were computers
49:40 - there were books of random numbers like
49:42 - this one all right so let's go what am I
49:44 - gonna do now let's have it run many many
49:46 - times and let's have it continuously
49:50 - display the average amount of rolls so
49:54 - so I don't know I've kind of gone a
49:56 - little I'm kind of gone off with a
49:58 - little tangent here if you're watching
50:00 - this make us into a creative fun game
50:02 - that you could actually play I'm gonna
50:03 - go this simulation route okay so now so
50:08 - now let's keep track of rolls average
50:14 - rolls all right and games plate so rolls
50:25 - of the number of rolls during one
50:27 - version of the game game played
50:29 - increases and average rolls is the
50:30 - number of rolls a minute I could keep a
50:38 - running average I could keep trying to
50:41 - keep track of a history let's let's say
50:42 - rolls is in hey we'll make it array then
50:46 - I don't need games played it's just the
50:47 - length all right so so but I do need the
50:51 - current rolls
50:54 - all right you just have the current yeah
50:56 - current I'll just have a variable called
50:59 - index into that so every time
51:04 - every frame is everytime I roll then
51:09 - rolls index plus plus all right then so
51:15 - I'm increasing the number of rolls then
51:17 - when the game's over the index goes to
51:20 - the next spot in the array I don't say
51:23 - no loop rather what I do is I start the
51:28 - game over so what do I do to start the
51:30 - game over first let me show first let me
51:36 - let me do this after I show the player
51:38 - oh no cuz oh boy Oh time out for a
51:43 - second I just this computer keeps going
51:45 - to sleep okay wait
51:51 - alright so here's the thing what's
51:53 - happening here i I'm done
51:57 - stick at the end the game is over go to
51:59 - the next one well do I want to see that
52:01 - I finished would be nice to see so what
52:04 - I probably should do is what I'm gonna
52:11 - do is actually just say game over this
52:17 - is terrible I would say game over equals
52:18 - false game over equals true and then I'm
52:23 - gonna deal with the game over logic
52:25 - separately down here if game over I
52:28 - think all I need to do is player reset
52:32 - the player right reset the player and
52:34 - have the index go up right reset the
52:39 - player and have the index go up and the
52:41 - player then needs a function called
52:43 - reset where this dot spot goes back to
52:47 - zero there we go all right I think I
52:49 - might have gotten all this stuff in
52:50 - there just try running it see what
52:51 - happens
52:53 - yeah the game is playing over and over
52:55 - again let's see rolls numbered and
52:58 - convert odd enough further that's not a
53:00 - good sign
53:00 - oh did I not did I forget to initialize
53:04 - the rolls at zero
53:05 - so what I need to do is when the game
53:08 - starts I need to say rolls at index and
53:15 - I want to put the game by the way back
53:16 - to a four by four
53:18 - just sort of play faster roles index
53:20 - equals zero and then when I increase the
53:23 - index I should say roles index and
53:28 - there's probably more elegant way
53:30 - terrible disarray but the next role
53:32 - starts at zero okay so now let's look at
53:36 - the roles there we go nine nine eight
53:38 - nine eight eight eight three does that
53:40 - make sense it's taking about that many
53:42 - roles that's kind of like wow did it in
53:45 - three roles whoops
53:48 - how could it's do it in zero something's
53:50 - wrong with the lehto because the last
53:52 - one is the current one I'm actually
53:53 - looking at it before it's finished so
53:55 - now when I do the average that makes
53:58 - sense so now what I want to do is
53:59 - calculate the average and you do that in
54:02 - sketch so sum equals zero I should use
54:06 - one of those nice array I could use the
54:08 - reduce array function and I need to go
54:12 - all the way up to roles dot length minus
54:13 - one because the current role does not
54:16 - count in part as part of the average and
54:18 - then I need to say sum plus equal roles
54:22 - index I and then the average is the sum
54:25 - divided by the roles dot length but
54:28 - minus one because there's one fewer and
54:30 - then what I can do is I can just say
54:32 - console let me let me actually make a
54:35 - Dom element on the page I will just say
54:41 - in the sketch I will say average P
54:48 - average P equal to create P and now I'm
54:54 - gonna say average P which is the average
54:59 - paragraph HTML average okay okay
55:03 - everybody settle down so this is the
55:05 - average amount of times it is now taking
55:08 - which I didn't I say eight so I think
55:11 - I'm about right but average amount of
55:14 - times it's taken to complete the game
55:16 - and it's probably a little bit less
55:17 - because I'm starting on the first spot
55:18 - that's why it's a little bit less I
55:20 - didn't actually should start at negative
55:21 - one let's start at let's start at the
55:27 - player should start at negative one
55:31 - and it would make sense from you by the
55:32 - way in the constructor to just call this
55:34 - dot reset right here I think that'll
55:36 - work
55:39 - so we can see now we have that math that
55:43 - I did in my brain appears to be correct
55:45 - because we're kind of through the Monte
55:47 - Carlo method getting that number of
55:49 - eight okay yes and I could have done a
55:52 - running average but I didn't I want to
55:56 - but I got afraid all right how long has
56:04 - this been so far this is one of these
56:05 - long challenges people really watch
56:07 - these things oh no anybody can stand to
56:10 - watch them all right now oh I didn't yes
56:18 - I did oh I didn't change it to negative
56:22 - one oh that's weird
56:30 - I just got lucky I guess now it's taking
56:33 - a little bit longer
56:34 - was I just wrong before about putting it
56:38 - to negative one 2048 it's simpler okay
56:53 - anyways company apologies for this
56:57 - little blip here but I've been trying
56:58 - you're starting at zero it's starting it
57:00 - at 1 I don't know what to do let
57:02 - negative 1 let's start it at negative 1
57:03 - so you're off the board I think that
57:05 - makes more sense
57:06 - yes ok so now let's start thinking about
57:13 - the exciting part the exciting part now
57:16 - what I need to do is start adding some
57:19 - snakes and ladders so let's just add now
57:24 - how should be theirs I guess there's how
57:27 - should I configure I could make them
57:28 - random let me make some manual ones so
57:31 - what I'm gonna do is manually override
57:32 - the board to make some snakes and
57:35 - ladders so what I'm going to do and I
57:38 - will put it back to 10 by 10 in a second
57:41 - but this is a little simpler for me so
57:43 - if I go into here in the sketch where
57:46 - I'm making the board after I'm done
57:50 - making the board what I could do is I
57:53 - could just say something like tiles
57:55 - index 6 dot next equals 1 so this would
58:04 - be in a four by four board 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
58:10 - this would be a snake that would go down
58:15 - - OH - I got one whatever but let's make
58:17 - it aa this is confusing because the
58:21 - numbers I put here are dot started with
58:23 - 0 so but the array in actual counted 0
58:26 - so but you get the idea it's in whatever
58:29 - the indexes is gonna point to the other
58:30 - ones so a couple things one is what I
58:33 - think that I would like to do so let's
58:34 - do this index 6 the next is 1 which is
58:37 - actually the second tile what I would
58:38 - like to do this is a little bit goofy as
58:40 - I could just I could also just say tiles
58:44 - index six dots snake equals true so I
58:47 - could give it a property like snake
58:49 - equals true but I could also just kind
58:52 - of figure this out right because in the
58:54 - tile itself when I'm about to draw it I
58:57 - could say if this dot next does not is
59:02 - does not equal to this dot index plus
59:06 - one right if it's not if the next tile
59:09 - is not the one right after it then it
59:11 - has to be a snake so what I want to do
59:13 - is draw I want to do a good thing I have
59:15 - that um my Center my C equals get this
59:22 - dot get center and next see these are
59:29 - very awkward variable names equals oh I
59:34 - I don't have access to the global
59:36 - variable tiles here but I could pass it
59:40 - in so when I say show when I draw them
59:44 - all this is very weird what I'm doing
59:47 - here I probably would want to refactor
59:49 - this later do it some different way I'm
59:50 - gonna Pat Isles is a global variable so
59:52 - I could get access to it that way but I
59:54 - like the idea of passing it in just to
59:56 - sort of for sanity's sake I could say
59:59 - tiles this taught next dot get Center
60:03 - and then I could draw a line let's say
60:05 - stroke wait for stroke 255 line from
60:15 - where my C 0 my C 1 next see why am I
60:22 - making these weird blames my Center next
60:27 - Center my Center 0 my Center 1 next
60:33 - Center 0 next Center 1 okay there look
60:42 - there's my snake now here's the thing is
60:46 - it actually working is it actually
60:48 - causing it to go down there if it ever
60:50 - lands on there I think it is because
60:52 - it's always going to where the next
60:53 - thing is and I don't really like I want
60:55 - to make a more interesting looking
60:57 - snake so let's pick a different tile
60:59 - like 9 how about 10 so it's a loose
61:06 - diagonal there we go okay so now let's
61:09 - slow this down a little bit
61:11 - frame rate 10 boy very hard for me to
61:19 - see if this is working right is it
61:20 - actually going to the next spot oh I
61:24 - don't think I actually told you to go to
61:25 - the next pot I would just tell 2 plus
61:27 - plus so let's take a look at that when
61:31 - the player moves
61:33 - oh it just moves the spot up but it
61:35 - can't do that anymore it can't do that
61:37 - anymore
61:38 - it has to examine its spot Oh weird so
61:43 - what it really should do is so we've to
61:46 - have the tiles here oh this is getting
61:47 - very awkward this is a very awkward game
61:51 - I'm making it's gonna have the tiles
61:53 - here and what it's going to do is in the
61:57 - player object it's going to take its
62:02 - spot and move up by this number and then
62:07 - it's going to say oh yeah this is why it
62:12 - would be nice for it to actually have a
62:13 - boolean variable as to whether because
62:15 - it's it's the act of landing on it so I
62:17 - need to check something when I land on
62:19 - it whether it should move to the next
62:20 - thing
62:21 - so you know what here's what I'm gonna
62:23 - do this in a different way I got an idea
62:25 - I've got an idea
62:29 - what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make each
62:30 - tile next is kind of unnecessary I don't
62:35 - know I'm not sure exactly why I have
62:37 - that in there anymore but I'm gonna say
62:39 - this dots snake equals zero and this dot
62:43 - ladder equals zero so they all have a
62:46 - snake and ladder of zero zero means well
62:51 - no it could be in this case there can
62:53 - never be a snake that takes you all the
62:55 - way back to the first spot so I'll have
62:56 - a snake and ladder of negative one all
62:59 - right negative one means no snake no
63:01 - ladder I could say false or something
63:03 - but anyway I'm gonna do that then in the
63:07 - sketch I'm not going to override the
63:10 - next
63:10 - just gonna say it's snake is one so now
63:14 - when I am when I am rendering the tile
63:22 - instead of checking the next thing which
63:24 - is kind of nuts I'm going to say if this
63:27 - snake is greater than zero I'm gonna
63:30 - draw that like ah but the next oh yeah
63:32 - and then I just go to the I draw the
63:34 - line from it to this dot snake it's
63:37 - greater than negative one or and maybe
63:42 - the well I'm gonna do these total is
63:44 - this silly I'm gonna do these as two
63:45 - separate if statements if this dot
63:48 - latter is greater than one and I could
63:52 - obviously condense these into one
63:53 - statement which I will eventually at
63:55 - some point in my life
63:56 - if this that latter is greater than one
63:58 - boo-yeah
64:00 - I'm still doing this project what the I
64:03 - was it's like five o'clock
64:04 - ass this dot ladder is greater than one
64:06 - then
64:09 - the ladders will be black all right so
64:14 - now let's take a look at this so I've
64:17 - still got the snake in there now what
64:19 - happens when the player rolls if the
64:25 - tile is tiles index this dot spot if
64:31 - this dot spot snake oh you know what I
64:36 - could do I could have the snake be a
64:38 - negative number and the zero means
64:42 - there's nothing this would be better
64:44 - let's do it a different way I got a
64:46 - better idea
64:47 - so by definition what should we call it
64:49 - snake ladder it's a snake either a snake
64:51 - or a ladder the tile spot the spot is
64:54 - right is it a snake snake or ladder
64:56 - they're all equal to zero
64:59 - it's a snake or ladder if it's equal to
65:00 - zero and when I create it I'm gonna say
65:08 - the snake or ladder is like negative
65:12 - five meaning go back five spots this is
65:15 - so much better so much better even
65:17 - though my variable names snicker glad
65:18 - it's got a terrible so now what I can do
65:22 - is in the tile hmm when I'm drawing it
65:26 - if snake or ladder is not equal to zero
65:32 - right
65:33 - then I've got to draw a line from this
65:38 - index plus okay so thus this snake for
65:45 - ladder that's it's the difference
65:48 - between where I am where I'm currently
65:49 - going to go back to and I draw that line
65:51 - and then I don't need this whole second
65:54 - nonsense thing and then of course in the
65:58 - player if it lands if this snake or
66:01 - ladder does not equal is not a zero then
66:05 - this dot spot plus equals that goes back
66:09 - to wherever it goes dare I say I have
66:12 - this now all right cannot read property
66:16 - get center of undefined player s line 23
66:20 - current get center tiles this dot spot
66:25 - because I started at negative one have I
66:28 - not moved yet tile snake or current
66:32 - equals tiles
66:33 - I'm mmm no it's time to add a move I
66:40 - really should add a move function okay
66:41 - fine hold on let's my my error might be
66:44 - because I'm really being silly about
66:46 - this why do I need a move function can I
66:49 - just roll it and move I don't want a
66:51 - move function where's my error here what
66:56 - was line 23 current is not defined so
66:58 - what is this dot spot there let's see
67:02 - what that is not a number so why is that
67:06 - not a number probably because of what
67:14 - this computer went to sleep oh yeah yeah
67:22 - you know I'm getting a great comment in
67:24 - the chat from Dennis who writes I don't
67:27 - need this I don't need this if statement
67:33 - because if it's zero it's
67:36 - not gonna change oh this is probably the
67:39 - problem I must have messed this up
67:43 - somehow so this plus equals snake our
67:47 - letter let's look at console dot log
67:49 - this dot spot this seems like it's the
67:52 - problem console dot log this snake or
67:54 - ladder it's probably my variable name
67:56 - it's the problem undefined so why is
68:00 - this undefined oh because it's not this
68:02 - it is the tile it is the tiles maker
68:06 - ladder of course the player is at a spot
68:08 - the tile is telling it where to go and
68:10 - by the way people were telling me this
68:12 - in the chat so I think I'm gonna try to
68:15 - feel confident that that's gonna fix it
68:17 - now and now get Center player twenty
68:21 - undefined no problem no problem
68:23 - Oh tile I didn't actually fix it weirdly
68:26 - enough okay let's try this again
68:30 - alright so oh you I see because the
68:34 - reason why I need a move is because I
68:37 - want to draw it there and then I want to
68:39 - draw it the next like I want to see it
68:41 - land there and see it go down like
68:42 - animation wise I kind of want to see it
68:44 - land there and go down okay first of all
68:45 - why did this happen player dot s line
68:47 - ten so if I got if I'm off the board
68:52 - here so what I what I do need to say is
68:55 - I do need this though if tile exists so
68:58 - as long as there is a tile there that'll
69:01 - fix that okay now it is working we can
69:05 - see cuz you can see it on but I don't
69:06 - like the fact that I don't see it land
69:08 - there so this
69:17 - I don't like the fact that I don't see
69:19 - it land there so what I think that I
69:22 - want to do is I want I do need that move
69:25 - function so I do need that move function
69:29 - because what I'm going to do is I'm
69:29 - going to do this aspect in the move
69:31 - function so move is a function that is
69:36 - going to deal with the snakes and
69:38 - ladders e thingy roll is just moving
69:41 - based on your role because then what I
69:46 - can do is I can roll move roll move
69:48 - because if I want to animate one versus
69:50 - the other
69:50 - and this is a little bit silly boy I
69:52 - have really gone off the deep end here
69:53 - with this but like then I but I kind of
69:56 - want to what I want to do is I want to
70:03 - say something like if if rolls index is
70:09 - is even like I want to do like one or
70:13 - the other like cuz I want to draw it
70:15 - where it landed and then I want to move
70:17 - it to the next thing which is gonna be
70:20 - awkward though cuz I only want to draw
70:21 - an extra oh I've done what I said I
70:23 - didn't want to do which is getting into
70:25 - the animating oh this is terrible but it
70:29 - isn't so bad actually so oops roll and
70:37 - then player dot move and tile so this is
70:40 - I this is I kind of I've loved I've I'd
70:44 - make my die six-sided yeah okay
70:46 - tile is not defined sketch j/s tiles oh
70:55 - wait wait wait wait wait oh no no no no
71:00 - first this doesn't make any sense
71:03 - because once I'm in here I never go
71:05 - again so if I want to do every other I
71:07 - can't actually keep track of the rolls
71:09 - because this is in a roll I could use
71:10 - just like the frame count which is going
71:13 - to be a problem because who knows what
71:14 - that's going to do but
71:23 - in the chat it says I feel like this is
71:26 - so much more complicated than it needs
71:27 - to be story of my life you know what
71:32 - four five ten mm-hmm so what I'm going
71:39 - to do now and we think about this what's
71:42 - a good what what can I do that's gonna
71:44 - be good here forget about this idea of
71:46 - animating it I told you I didn't need
71:48 - the silly move thing let's go backwards
71:49 - let's go backwards forget about that
71:52 - edit that out because a little bit
71:55 - shorter okay so I could I kind of would
72:04 - like to at some point do something where
72:06 - it lands there and then animates going
72:08 - to the next step but I'm gonna like skip
72:12 - worrying about that right now I'm just
72:15 - going to this is working right you can
72:17 - see that it's taking me an average of
72:19 - about 12 now with this one little blip
72:21 - now what I can do so first of all I want
72:23 - those ladders to be a different color so
72:26 - what I'm gonna do here in the tile is if
72:33 - the this is going to be stroke wonder if
72:37 - this would actually work
72:38 - 2:55 I well I could do one of those what
72:41 - are those things called those fancy
72:42 - little if statements you do in one space
72:44 - here what is called again somebody tell
72:47 - me who told you survives in 2048 what's
72:50 - that what could I never remember that I
72:52 - don't use them I'm just gonna say I'm
72:55 - gonna do my own nice little way of doing
72:57 - this in a really ridiculous way if this
72:59 - maker ladder is less than zero then it's
73:02 - going to be that is a snake otherwise it
73:05 - is a ladder okay so let's look at this
73:08 - now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
73:11 - configure in this main sketch a couple
73:15 - more of these oh let's make it let's
73:18 - make it let's make it 10 by 10
73:22 - where do I do that again I change the
73:24 - resolution to 40 and now I've got a lot
73:28 - of stuff to work with I've got a hundred
73:30 - tiles so what I'm gonna do actually I'm
73:32 - gonna just pick make some randomly
73:33 - because I kind of wanna I don't want to
73:35 - figure it out so I'm gonna just miss
73:37 - they let a equals 0 I is less than five
73:39 - I'm gonna have five snakes and five
73:46 - ladders and I could so I'm gonna pick
73:52 - I'm gonna pick a random tile and I'm
73:56 - gonna say tile dot snakes or ladder
73:59 - equals a random negative number between
74:03 - negative 10 and negative negative 1 this
74:08 - is doubt I could have a serious problem
74:10 - here but I'm not gonna worry about it
74:11 - just yet then I'm gonna do this between
74:16 - 1 and 10 and actually it doesn't make
74:20 - sense for his ladder to go horizontally
74:22 - it's got to go on to a different row so
74:24 - that so it doesn't make sense actually
74:26 - for any whoops if I'm picking them
74:36 - randomly it doesn't make sense for any
74:39 - of the snakes to be in the first row and
74:41 - any of the ladders to be in the last row
74:43 - all right so I should probably account
74:44 - for that so I can't just pick a random
74:48 - tile like I want to do this well but I
74:51 - also want to do it quickly and not worry
74:53 - about it but let's let's be thoughtful
74:55 - about this so random I guess I have to
74:58 - pick an index so I want to pick there's
75:02 - a certain number of qov there's a
75:05 - certain number of columns so I can say I
75:08 - want to pick a random where am i doing
75:10 - that I want to pick a random index
75:14 - between for a snake it can't be in the
75:18 - bottom so it has to be the first one
75:22 - would be columns two tiles dot length so
75:26 - that's a random index and then that in
75:31 - debt that would get a random amount
75:33 - whoops what is that that would get a
75:36 - random negative number and it should be
75:41 - them by minimum it has to be the number
75:43 - right it's got to go be at least the
75:45 - number of kala good
75:49 - you know if it's kind of earlier in the
75:51 - thing it could point down I don't know I
75:53 - just make it in between columns and oh
75:59 - and then all the way back to oh the
76:02 - difference between what's the Mac okay
76:03 - let's figure this out this is worth
76:05 - doing nuts okay let's say I pick this
76:11 - here the only valid places that I would
76:15 - have a snake going to this would be the
76:17 - first one and this would be the last one
76:21 - so the range is between its index - well
76:32 - it depends on which torretta its index -
76:35 - oh there's got to be some nice math for
76:37 - this this is four by four the number of
76:41 - columns modulus - yeah yeah that's
76:44 - always going to be the case the number
76:46 - of columns not the number College moment
76:49 - that its index module sorry sorry its
76:53 - index - its index modulus the number of
76:57 - columns so that's gonna get me at a
76:59 - minimum here and then the bottom is just
77:03 - you know I don't want anything to be
77:05 - able to go past so so that's where it
77:10 - can be oh oh so they I don't know I I
77:12 - don't need so I could just pick the
77:16 - range between index modulus columns
77:20 - that's - - that's the smallest amount
77:24 - and not the smallest it's a bit largest
77:27 - amount in the case of negative numbers
77:29 - and then - all the way to the bottom
77:31 - would be itself itself - one itself -
77:39 - one index minus one so this should work
77:42 - but this is that okay I think it'll work
77:45 - for picking random ones so this is going
77:48 - to be a random number between what did I
77:52 - say it was between its negative its
77:58 - index plus one
78:01 - I'm actually gonna just you know what
78:02 - I'm gonna do this is so silly
78:04 - I'll just make this negative one this
78:07 - doesn't allow me to understand the range
78:08 - much more easily index modulus columns
78:12 - and then index minus one so that is that
78:18 - is for a snake and I don't feel like
78:22 - doing two of these so I'm just going to
78:24 - say I'm gonna I'm gonna do ten and if I
78:31 - modulus 2 equals 0 then D I uh
78:37 - this is a I'm gonna I'm going to say I'm
78:39 - going to say let Direction equal 1
78:41 - otherwise Direction equals negative 1
78:43 - because the numbers should work out the
78:45 - same way in terms of going to the top no
78:48 - they don't work they don't work the same
78:50 - way in terms of going to the top because
78:53 - if I need to go to the top I've got to
78:55 - subtract the length not zero so there's
78:57 - a lot more option to go to the top
78:59 - design the board I was gonna hard code
79:05 - the numbers alright let's do this let's
79:07 - do this so this is going to be the rain
79:10 - let's just do some snakes let's just see
79:14 - if we get some snakes ok
79:15 - index is not defined sketch J s line
79:18 - forty Oh what am i doing here I have to
79:26 - pick a random index whoa I lost
79:33 - completely lost where I was first I'm
79:35 - picking a random tile so first I want to
79:40 - pick a tile index which is a I had that
79:45 - in here already which is from the second
79:49 - row columns all the way to the end a
79:53 - random number
79:57 - ah I worry it's gonna be okay it's gonna
80:02 - be okay everybody that's the index and
80:04 - then where I've got oh boy and that oh
80:10 - wait there were two lines of code there
80:12 - that's what's going on here and then oh
80:17 - my goodness this that particular tile is
80:21 - this random thing
80:25 - why why why is it Auto formatting this
80:29 - up here what have I done wrong random
80:34 - there we go okay
80:36 - so this is the index right I'm picking
80:38 - some random tile by the way I could take
80:40 - the same tile twice which is a real
80:42 - problem I've got it I've got to deal
80:44 - with that this was a terrible idea
80:46 - oh my goodness a terrible idea then it's
80:48 - snakes or ladder number is some random
80:51 - amount a little bit back all the way to
80:53 - the bottom okay let's take this
80:56 - unexpected token line 43 because I have
80:59 - extra extra brackets okay
81:03 - all right I don't see doesn't look like
81:06 - it picked Danny okay well but it is or
81:12 - am I just not seeing them oh it's is it
81:15 - going down and wait wait so hold on so
81:17 - let's take a look at console.log tiles
81:24 - index snakes or a ladder I should have
81:29 - thought about this okay so we got this
81:34 - one oh there's like I put in multiple
81:37 - variables sometimes I say snake or
81:39 - ladder as soon as I say snakes or
81:41 - leather that is really bad okay so a
81:46 - snake or ladder I think that's what I
81:49 - meant to do I think that's the brothels
81:52 - there we go look look we've got two
81:55 - there there are three snakes one goes
81:59 - from here to there one goes from here to
82:00 - there and one goes from there to here
82:02 - right so we're having trouble getting to
82:04 - the top does it keeps wow it's really
82:07 - good at landing on that one oh it made
82:09 - it past it
82:10 - oh boy
82:12 - well this is exciting though it's
82:14 - actually kind of working all right so my
82:16 - design is horrific first of all one
82:19 - thing I really need to do is when I draw
82:22 - the tiles I need to say when I draw the
82:26 - rectangle I need to say no stroke those
82:30 - I don't make this is much more clear
82:31 - okay so a couple things I should do I'm
82:32 - not gonna I really should make it so I
82:34 - can't pick the same one twice but since
82:36 - I only made three that's not that big of
82:38 - a deal this is actually working
82:40 - Frank amazingly now I'm gonna go back to
82:42 - the sketch and let me pick three ladders
82:46 - so the ladders would be anywhere from
82:50 - right the ladders would be anywhere from
82:53 - the very top oh oh interesting no
83:00 - there's no ladder on the top anywhere
83:02 - from the second row all the way to the
83:04 - bottom so I need to pick an index that
83:07 - goes all the way from 0 to the length
83:11 - minus columns and then I'm going to go
83:14 - up a certain amount so if I were here
83:19 - I'm going to take this you know it's
83:28 - actually columns minus index modulus
83:31 - columns oh that only works though oh no
83:40 - that's fine that's fine because yeah
83:42 - because I I want to know how many up to
83:45 - there so to always go to another row
83:46 - I'll take that instead I'll go up by
83:49 - this much and then the limit is I can
83:52 - only go up by you know - laughs maybe
83:55 - the second-to-last spot okay so now I'm
83:58 - going to make some random ones where I'm
84:01 - going to pick a random index so I've got
84:04 - to go from the zero I did that already
84:07 - and then I could go up by columns minus
84:13 - index mod columns and then all the way
84:16 - up to tiles lengths - where I am minus
84:23 - one
84:24 - I think that makes sense all right so
84:27 - let's see now if I can get a bunch of
84:28 - ladders there there's a bunch of layers
84:30 - now interestingly enough because of the
84:32 - order I've drawing stuff the ladders get
84:34 - covered over so I should definitely fix
84:37 - that let's see here I've got it I should
84:41 - probably do a pass the tile let me do
84:47 - let me do let me do a this show function
84:53 - it will be by itself and then I'll do
84:54 - show snakes ladders and I'll do all this
84:59 - stuff in there so that I can do that
85:01 - afterwards oh ok so in the so I can do
85:05 - that as a separate loop and so here when
85:08 - I'm when I where am i showing all the
85:10 - tiles here can do this and then I can do
85:15 - tiles that show snakes ladders there we
85:22 - go now here's the thing the question is
85:24 - is this actually I don't can't tell if
85:28 - the ladders are working can anyone see
85:29 - if the ladders are working like is it
85:35 - skipping stuff if it lands on a ladder
85:38 - yeah it did it just went up didn't it
85:40 - just go up there I'm pretty sure it did
85:42 - I'm pretty sure it did yeah and this is
85:46 - pretty bad where I'm you can get awfully
85:48 - get some very unlucky things so
85:49 - interestingly enough right let's just
85:52 - for the sake of argument very quickly
85:53 - I'm gonna I'm gonna run fast again so
85:56 - I'm gonna go back to the sketch if you
85:57 - were really done here I'm gonna take out
85:59 - this slower frame rate I'm gonna take
86:02 - out adding any snakes and ladders and
86:04 - I'm gonna run this really fast so the
86:09 - average should be and by the way I
86:10 - should be allowed to roll us let's let's
86:12 - make it a six-sided die I don't know
86:13 - what what it actually is but let's look
86:16 - in the role let's say you can roll a 1
86:18 - through 6 which actually would be a 1
86:22 - through 7 if I'm flooring it I guess I
86:24 - could round it I could do 0 through 6
86:26 - and round it without actual work
86:28 - no no because then I could get a 0
86:29 - anyway so let's do this so it can roll a
86:33 - bit more so we could see the average
86:35 - amount is around
86:38 - thirty does that make sense it's a
86:40 - hundred yeah I I'm gonna have to just
86:43 - assume that makes sense that an average
86:45 - it's gonna take about 30 rolls it seemed
86:48 - to be doing a little bit better right
86:49 - now so now let's add in those snakes and
86:51 - ladders oh I look forward to all the
86:56 - much better versions you all make of
86:57 - this and there we go this looks terrible
87:01 - well those ladders are really helping
87:03 - out ladders are really making it way
87:07 - let's look at a different combination
87:09 - well look at this it's a little bit
87:11 - weird you get a snake and then you would
87:14 - get a ladder but you wouldn't because I
87:16 - don't think I check I'm gonna roll again
87:18 - I can't roll the zero I don't check if
87:19 - there's a ladder at the end of your
87:21 - snake so that should be another probably
87:22 - edge condition that I don't allow I
87:25 - don't know if this is gonna turn into a
87:27 - video or not what I'm gonna do is yeah
87:35 - hundred divided by three and a half is
87:38 - that right that the average role of one
87:41 - two three four five six one plus two
87:42 - plus three plus four to five six divided
87:44 - by six I think so so but here's the
87:48 - thing now let's let's really make this
87:49 - insane
87:53 - there we go this one is actually quite
87:58 - easy to win sort of I don't know exactly
88:00 - what's happening there's a lot of
88:02 - ladders connecting but I almost want to
88:05 - watch it really slowly now so let's
88:07 - watch it I should make all of these like
88:09 - variables I can control but let's do
88:14 - framerate one okay
88:18 - I should really display the role you can
88:21 - see here oh whoa oh come on go go make
88:26 - it to the end to the end
88:30 - does anybody boy some animation to help
88:33 - debug or something like console logging
88:35 - would really help here but I think you
88:37 - can see that it just jumped up oh it
88:39 - went back there we go move out to the
88:40 - end all right I don't know what to say
88:44 - you've reached the end of a completely
88:48 - monstrous tangled whee
88:50 - of snakes and ladders I hope you enjoyed
88:53 - this coding challenge I hope that you
88:55 - make a interesting variation of this
88:57 - game you think about the design of it
88:59 - you make it playable there's so many
89:01 - possibilities here thank you for
89:03 - watching this coding challenge as always
89:05 - the code will be available
89:06 - please share your on github and there's
89:10 - a there's a some instructions there how
89:12 - to share your own version so it's linked
89:14 - from the page where I have the code
89:15 - running as well and I look forward to
89:17 - hearing your feedback thank you oh my
89:24 - god okay hold on I think I think I'm
89:28 - gonna need to do there probably some
89:31 - mistakes here all right so here's think
89:33 - I have to go I did fix matters I
89:36 - disappointed everybody who wanted me to
89:37 - do 2048 which probably would have been
89:39 - easier but famous last words this seems
89:41 - like the simplest thing I could ever
89:42 - possibly do so people are saying that
89:49 - it's not working I'm wondering if it's
89:50 - not working like let me let me take a
89:52 - few minutes to debug this a bit more
89:55 - seriously so for example let's make the
90:03 - role only ever a one okay
90:07 - now this would make it and let's let's
90:12 - make fewer let's make fewer of these
90:17 - things two and two
90:21 - okay so now you know it's going very
90:24 - slowly we can at least sort of get us
90:26 - and now of course it's never gonna get
90:28 - past that so let's at least just see
90:31 - that that first snake works yeah I know
90:39 - it's half past I'll be a little bit late
90:40 - to the thing downstairs it's fine okay
90:45 - so that works let me put let me take out
90:55 - the snakes well let me just do this
90:56 - again until I get a nice ladder at the
90:59 - beginning oh look at this it like the
91:03 - the snakes and ladders will affect the
91:05 - stroke of that that's a weird little bug
91:08 - so let me just get it all the way to
91:10 - there we could wait it's not making
91:17 - random moves right now
91:25 - yeah so let's see if it goes back down
91:29 - yeah yeah I think it's working
91:32 - I mean this shows that it's working if I
91:36 - now let me do it with so what would be
91:40 - nice is for me to draw where it's I know
91:45 - what I could do this is why I need a
91:47 - move because I could draw its next spot
91:51 - and then it could good so I think I I
91:54 - wonder if I should come back a little
91:57 - bit later fix this up switch the colors
92:03 - yeah there's not really a point in
92:06 - having two separate ladders what does
92:08 - that mean so I think that it is in fact
92:13 - me it's just now it's just an infinite
92:15 - loop I think it's working even though I
92:18 - botched so much of this I think I should
92:23 - do like a quick little intro to it
92:27 - because I think it's this has to be one
92:29 - video but it's gonna be long and kind of
92:31 - crazy set red color for the snake that
92:34 - makes more sense I'm just trying to
92:37 - think I turn to think about this move
92:40 - animation where I really should show the
92:44 - role it really should have a state yes
92:47 - what this is missing is a state meaning
92:52 - it should have a state here it is now it
92:56 - rolls we see the role now we see where
92:59 - it's going then it goes there is that a
93:01 - snake no role again if it is move to the
93:07 - next spot draw that so I really should
93:09 - keep a state variable to keep track of
93:11 - all that animation stuff the question is
93:17 - do I do that in a separate maybe I'll
93:19 - make that a part two video to like add
93:23 - the animation aspect maybe I'll come
93:26 - back up here in like an hour
93:29 - or could I just do that really quickly
93:31 - let's just see if I can make that a part
93:33 - too just to see just to see what happens
93:35 - I think that'll really help
93:36 - I think that'll really help I'm sure I'm
93:37 - gonna botch this
93:45 - oh yeah two parts the endgame and the
93:49 - snakes and ladders that's kind of a good
93:51 - idea the thing is I don't know if it
93:52 - makes sense I can't ever decide whether
93:54 - that's better just have one long video
93:55 - or multi two more multiple smaller part
93:58 - videos I don't ever know about this I
94:01 - don't know if anybody I mean there's
94:02 - probably like I correct YouTube's
94:04 - algorithm answer to that but eyeball
94:06 - want to know what's like more
94:08 - interesting and useful to view feel
94:10 - something vibrating I do have to go but
94:16 - I feel like I could be like 10 minutes
94:18 - late it'll be fine you never see the
94:20 - intervals all right all right I don't
94:22 - know where this is gonna go or what
94:27 - let's see
94:29 - all right I'm now going to add I really
94:33 - just need a state I really need to see
94:35 - the animation this is sort of like
94:36 - terrible that I've done in this sort of
94:38 - like monstrous Frankenstein version of
94:40 - snakes and ladders what I want to do is
94:42 - I'm gonna keep a variable in my call it
94:43 - state and there's gonna be really three
94:46 - states
94:46 - there's the I'm rolling to see where I'm
94:49 - going to go then there's the state of
94:52 - I'm going to the next spot then there's
94:56 - the state of then there's like
94:59 - optionally a state where I have to fall
95:01 - down or climb up then there's another
95:05 - roll so there's so so if state I'm gonna
95:08 - I could probably there's like a way to
95:09 - use like enums and all sorts of fancy
95:11 - I'm just gonna keep track of these
95:12 - numbers so state equals zero that's the
95:15 - very first thing we do and if state
95:17 - equals zero we're going to roll okay
95:27 - we're going to roll then what I need to
95:32 - do is and I'm gonna put this in here
95:37 - right now is show the the player
95:44 - I wonder if actually I should redraw
95:46 - anything
95:52 - thinking about thinking about this if
95:55 - state is yeah make three parts for each
95:58 - part have an intro a good idea
96:00 - assignment if state is here I want to
96:03 - roll and the player is going to have a
96:12 - I'm going to make the function called
96:15 - roll dice or roll it and the roll is an
96:21 - actual number so the roll
96:27 - we get the roll now temporarily the
96:32 - player is also going to know it's next
96:36 - and we should put this all in reset its
96:43 - next spot right so I want the player
96:48 - always know like it's spot and it's next
96:50 - spot where it's where it rolled to
96:51 - because that will help I think so I'm
96:54 - going to say okay great so hold on I'm
96:57 - gonna stop this I gotta go I'm gonna
96:59 - come back I'm gonna come back because I
97:01 - could just do this little bit I just got
97:03 - to go to this thing for like an hour
97:04 - I'll come back in an hour which will be
97:07 - in the middle of the night for most of
97:09 - you I'm gonna think about whether how
97:11 - this should get divided up yeah dice is
97:14 - plural dicing or I'm gonna I'm gonna
97:16 - come back so this is good you can also
97:19 - you can tweet me your suggestions for
97:22 - how to fake this better act Schiffman
97:24 - I'm gonna come back a little bit later
97:27 - in like an hour I really gotta go and
97:30 - finish this
97:33 - what are these days I'm gonna have to
97:35 - like a schedule and then things are
97:37 - gonna make sense I'm gonna come back all
97:39 - right thank you everybody this was gonna
97:41 - like abruptly stop right now I'm gonna
97:43 - leave everything on and when I come back
97:45 - up I'm going to press start streaming
97:47 - again my guess would be probably in
97:50 - around one hour okay so I will see you
97:54 - then

Cleaned transcript:

hello welcome to the coding train Oh is everybody doing today I have to say I have a lot of dirt on my glasses there's really a problem and I really should clean it because I would like to be able to see you with my clear vision interestingly enough you appear to be this round circular thing it's actually well I'm sorry this is my practice I'm testing the audio I'm actually live streaming today's Friday that means it's time for the coding train with me dan Schiffman the one problem I have this week is it's like it's like my time zones like 4 o'clock it's gonna be 5 o'clock in an hour it's been a very long week this was the first week of the NYU semester New York University to school the arts ITP as a place where I teach full time and that means I was very busy this week in fact had a makeup class today meaning I had to teach a class this afternoon for about 3 hours so I'm feeling a little bit lethargic I also I can hear there's a class going on in the room next door and I sometimes make a little bit too much noise in here and get a little silly I don't want to disturb them I think it ends in 15 minutes though I'm I'm kind of you know just here taking deep breaths trying to get my energy going but welcome thank you for tuning in so as you if you've been watching the last several Friday live streams I have been struggling and doing my best and working through this playlist of video tutorials building a simple neural network library in JavaScript why I have no idea I am repeating not nearly as well the work done by many people countless times before me but I am trying to wrap my head around the idea of the inner workings of a neural network system what it a little bit about just sort of making a simple library and with the goal of once I have that done a couple of different things number one is starting to apply those same concepts but with a more robust framework namely a framework called deep learning is deep learn Janice Organa go check that out I will be getting to that very soon in future videos and my other goal wait did I have I said well that was the goal oh yes is to start doing some creative and interesting examples with with neural networks and genetic algorithms and just to eventually I mean I have this off I'm not going to show it but eventually I'm gonna get to that so that's certainly my main driving goal from now to the beginning of May when the semester then ends and then the summer happens I don't know break this elbow in June because this one's already broken it's now mostly healed anyway and then I don't know what I'm gonna do over the summer but I'll figure that out so here's the thing though this is a long week III one thing I have really discovered night I know I said this last week I'm gonna repeat it again I think there's pedagogical educational entertainment perhaps dare I say value in watching me make mistakes and have to debug and get frustrated and kind of go nuts that's my general mode of operating however it is seems that when I go through a particular math algorithm like gradient descent or matrix multiplication or back propagation if I get it all wrong it's not really that helpful so I have been doing some more readings more research some more practice with the next phase of the neural network library than building but I will not be getting to it today oh I just didn't have time this week I don't feel ready for it yet we're gonna take a break and I'm gonna try to do some fun I also think I'm you know I'm think I'm coming down with something it just sort of feels like you know that that feeling you get right before you're about to get a cold or a flu or something so I don't know I'm gonna I'm gonna work on a power throat I'm here for the for you the viewer of the coding train I thank you so much for tuning in and I'm gonna try to do some game stuff today what I started with actually was random walks because I taught my first class a class called nature of code where I go through a lot of the stuff in I'll just open this up here nature of code calm slash book and one of the very beginning pieces in the introduction is looking at random walks and I had this list somewhere of all sorts of variations of things you could do with a random walk like vary the probability of which direction or vary the length of the step or we get into 3d all these sort of different ideas and I was thinking I was gonna because the first day of class and that's kind of mine is there I was gonna start with that as my bunch of very and I have a coding challenge or random walk coding how I did a while back so we're gonna start with doing some variations of that then I was thinking about this presentation I saw over the weekend by another professor here at the game center Tisch School of the Arts game sundry if you did not know this there is a full and at BFA and MFA undergrad and graduate degree in game design that you can get Naomi Clarke gave a presentation and she talked a lot about snakes and ladders and Monte Carlo methods and was just like fascinating to me and I was thinking like I'm gonna program it snakes and ladders simulation which had already been suggested to me but it didn't come clear to my head so that's one thing I list and then loyal viewer Simon who I always like to refer to reminded me that 2048 has been a suggestion for quite a while in the rainbow topics repository and I always look at it I think like oh that's gonna be too hard today I was like a lecture look at that game I played it before we go baby maybe do it probably run into lots of problems would probably take too much longer than I think and I'll get stuck but I think I could do it so that's what I'm working with now those are my two ideas so I think what I'm going to do and I should say this is the other inviable I will make this up to you I mean in some ways I'm just here of my own volition but I do have a patron group thank you so much to the patrons of the coding train patreon.com slash coding train with membership you get a you can join our slack channel but I do today is gonna be a little bit shorter you have to be at a thing it sounds very cryptic a meeting an event downstairs I'm on the 9th floor I have to bend the fourth floor and 530 ish so I will try to make this up to you next week I won't usually be teaching on Friday like I was today so I usually will have the whole day and we can do some morning sessions which is better for a lot of the international viewers some you know I feel like this is like party time it's like Friday no I don't I don't I don't have party time I don't have party time my life but if I did I would do it at 4 o'clock so that I could go to bed around like 530 or 545 because I really just anyway so it's gonna be a little shorter today so maybe maybe maybe maybe I could do both snakes and ladders and 2048 but just in case I cannot let's uh let's simon suggested i do a strawpoll which is my new thing that i like to do just to sort of get a sense here so pick one I don't if I put one first is that like strangely biasing you in some direction snakes and ladders 2048 well how comments no no no multiple option no no no prob okay Cray poll alright there's your URL somebody in the chat please who has moderator privileges please take that URL and paste it into the chat we will give the I will be giving you a minute or two here wake everything up oh the cameras are going up as you know the coding train is sponsored by water water what I do to drink it is put it in some sort of container and then take the container and I take it and I put it up to my mouth Thank You water for sponsoring the coding tree actually I'm sort of joking around but I do potentially I might be releasing a sponsored video soon I've not tried that before it's kind of a unique interesting experiment to try them excited about it stay tuned next week it might even happen I should say that sometimes another benefit of the Patriot herbal I have not done one of these recently is that sometimes if I'm testing something out or after you like a certain content that I'm not I I sent his wife I will lecture like smaller live streams for the patron audience its what had a few contracted yes that's the slogan right so the other nice thing about doing these I mean snakes and ladders has no strategy to it it's a purely random chance game there's gonna be drama and lots of suspense and excitement but there's no strategy whereas 2048 is a game that actually there's technique or strategy to play so I will want to revisit these to look at looking at different machine learning or algorithms to play the game automatically ok 24 8 is winning do people not know what these are I've let this straw poll on for way too long snakes and ladders if you live in the United States and you are I don't know of a certain generation this is universal enough but for me I know it is chutes and ladders but I believe the game originated in India and it was called snakes and ladders we can look at the Wikipedia page here is the Wikipedia page for the ancient Indian board game where you try to get up to the top and the snakes send you back down but the ladders allow you to get up faster and there's some interesting questions around interesting probability analysis stuff we can do around it and 2048 is a game that I believe here it is but I don't want to look at it on Wikipedia is a game that I believe a 19 year old put together in a weekend that it kind of went viral and it's based on many similar games previously what I understand it's a clone it's a very similar of cloning 3 anyway 2040 has been on so many times has it but I haven't done it oh now I'm like at the point where it's like is the world such that like there's so many coding tutorial videos everywhere the 2048 is like vishay alright alright alright alright I don't know oh oh I'm picking snakes and ladders that's all I have to say to you all he's no 2048 wow people really anti 2048 I hate knowing it well why is it winning supposedly I feel that the coding Train merits more than 68 I mean on the one hand I should be like wow I mean I there was a time where I was like there were like 43 people watching the livestream I was like shocked by that so I was really just trying to pull you which to do first I my clan with snakes and ladders I don't know where I got this 2048 thinking I thought everyone would be so excited okay okay okay okay hold on the chat it's interesting it seems like the numbers are in favor of 2048 but the the loudness of the anti 2488 crowd is very very really like resonating in my brain here alright Internet yeah snakes and ladders is catching up catching up let me just point out that if I go to rainbow topics Rose I'd caused such controversy look at this look at all this thumbs up here that's the most thumbs up I've ever seen in my repository look it keeps getting suggested and other issues have to be closed oh yeah I'm what about making it different like using three instead of two all right what all right we're gonna go I have a new method we're gonna go to the tried and true method which is so much better I don't like this voting thing this voting thing was a terrible idea okay are you ready for this now I will do whatever this says I will do whatever this says by the way I will do both of these eventually so even if I don't get to one of them today I will do it I will take it that snakes and ladders is very much desired okay this is very this is very scientifically Randa okay [Laughter] okay democracy dies in darkness indeed okay all is right with the world Wow the other thing though I was going to do to 2048 in processing and snakes and ladders in JavaScript so totally cheated no I by the way now I've just like nobody's happy a bit perfect I made it so that nobody in the chat is epic okay by the way I just want to point out that snakes and laughs is really catching up here you know I understand that I'm probably messing this up don't worry that this this is gonna be okay I'm sorry the loud voices got me worried okay okay sorry for the two or three of you who are now leaving livestream well come back another time I bought of these days I will actually use the straw poll it's kind of a pattern that I just take a temperature but that do whatever I I would have done if it had landed the random thing I I believe in randomness okay so I believe in randomness ah all right so let's go to desktop p5 I use the p5 manager to create a project which I totally don't remember what I think it's what does it generate G B for bundle of snakes and snakes letters okay so CD snakes ladders I'm gonna run a server I am going to leave this Wikipedia page open I'm gonna go here I'm gonna open up the JavaScript console I'm gonna minimize the terminal I am going to maximize the maximize the terminal I'm gonna open up a code editor and we will be beginning all righty then 2048 snakes all right so let's do the little stupid things that I do for no good reason because I refuse to edit the template so that does it for me every time let's do it as a square maybe 500 by 500 will work well and let's put a background in there so I can see that something's happening all right and how's that looking let's go a little bit whoops no let's go a little less here a little more console we all need a little more console in our life this is why I said I was gonna do this morning okay yeah okay that's the worst terminal I know I all my students they come they like open up their computers they've got fancy other applications for terminal everything's like color coded up the worst plain vanilla pathetic terminal I will say however that this is not my working login this is my streaming log I can have a few more things that make my terminal a little bit better when I log in as myself on the computer all right I mean thank our sponsor one more time h2o yeah we could get rid of this Thank You Alka hi by the way I'm really thinking of switching over to Firefox in my live streams I don't know why I'm just I'm thinking about it okay I better get started because I have to leave like an hour Thank You Damian I'm very sorry you are right to be a noise I would be totally to you it's absolutely a legitimate complaint that 2048 wasn't fall and now I'm not doing it I will I will deuce I will somehow justice will be served in its own way the universe will come become even at some point any chance you could use the debugger at some point during the challenge you mean like the chrome debugger or the processing debugger cuz I would yeah alright so let's think about this I don't really know actually the nice thing the fun thing about this challenge is I have no idea what I'm about to do I know this game let's make this a little wider come on Wikipedia oh okay no wonder oh I didn't realize I was like off the what is going on must have all of my windows exactly the way I like them this can go wide this can be here totally here no problem get a little more console okay there we go that's my warmup usually I do that before our livestream but for some reason today I thought I would show you a little like inside baseball hello I'm about to do a coding challenge that I am very excited about this is one of my favorite games it is called snakes and ladders it is an ancient board game created in India but is that correct I tried it again due to over I do over do over mimimi mimimi also I have this wire problem almost like tripped over this wire matrix of ten by ten hello it is me I'm going to do a coding challenge I'm actually quite excited about this coding challenge I'm going to attempt to make snakes and ladders a very well known ancient Indian video game I in this country of the United States where I live I am I know it it's chutes and ladders but I'm going to make snakes and ladders stay true to the original version of the game so I'm gonna do this with out a lot of like animation design I just want to get the mechanics of the game going and I want to think about some interesting properties of the game I saw a presentation by Naomi Clarke here at the game center about snakes and ladders and it got me thinking just about all sorts of stuff so maybe that stuff will come up as I try to make it now I'm gonna I'm gonna read this Wikipedia page to understand the game but I'm gonna try to diagram it first in my own way to see if we can think about how kind of data structures variables classes what kind of things we need to program it so the game is a simple game and let's actually start with it I'm gonna start and make a really simple version of the game it's called and because there are no snakes and there's no ladder so it's just and this is the game called and and let's make it four by four obviously the grid size the board there's so many ways that you could sort of consider the board but I'm gonna consider the board of the game to be a four by four grid and each spot is going to be a certain number and the numbers are gonna look like this I am cat whoops how about four by three so apparently for me to start three good lesson learn number one is that if I'm starting over here I want to end on this side of the board by wrapping around like this I can't have an even number of rows where's my eraser this is completely missing I think you could edit out be looking for the eraser ah found it okay so let me let's just look at it this way so the idea of the game is if I am a player I roll a die or maybe spin a wheel mean and maybe so maybe I get maybe I can move one two or three steps maybe there's just three possibilities so if I get a three I will go one two three and then if I get a two I will go one then I will be here if I get a one I'll move to here if I get another three I'll move to here another three over here forget a one once I reach here I win now I have a question do you have to roll the exact number to reach to win or you can you over roll the end well we can kind of make the game work either way so this is the basic mechanic of the game no strategy pure luck two players one goes first one goes second alternating turns revered it's the end first wins now there are snakes in their ladders but this basic idea let's first implement this and I'm going to talk about what makes it interesting once we kind of go past that now there's variety of different ways we could do this I think what I want is I want a player and a player just has a what's the what's the terminology for the spot that they're on I guess I'll just say a player has a spot that's the spot they sell the tile that they are currently on and then we have this idea of a tile which is each one of these and the tiles maybe just have which tile they're connected to next as well as perhaps an x and y location and a size like a width and a height for rendering them on the canvas or ever drawing graphic surface we're going to do I think that's enough description talking about the game I probably lost 80% of the viewers by now let's go over to try to dark coding some of this stuff okay oh yeah Here I am hmm okay I have no code I am using p5 GS library that's gonna help me with a lot of drawing stuff I've got a set function of draw function and I'm setting the background so let's first let's think about this I'm gonna actually make a couple other JavaScript files I'm gonna make one called tile Jas I'm gonna make one called a player is and I'm gonna use objectoriented programming yes six classes so I'm going to say a player when I make a player the player has a spot and the spot they're in is zero alright so that's the idea of a player now I'm gonna make the idea of a tile and what did I say a tile is going to have some x value where it is some Y value where it is and maybe the tile that it's the next one that you would walk to next so now and maybe it has a width and a height let's have everything be square so I'll just call it WH for square now what I'm going to do is here well that's like this 300 by 400 let's have the width be 300 and the height before with be 300 the height be 400 this will kind of Oh with these would be 400 and the height should be 300 that allowed me have nice 100 by 100 tiles Oh Beverly I'm in a program this so you could just plug in any numbers and don't make a big complicated board but for right now let's start with it this way 400 comma 300 I'm quicker than this and now what I want to do is make some tiles so I'm gonna create a variable like I know that they're all gonna be a hundred by a hundred let's let's actually just make a variable called like resolution and I'm gonna call I'm gonna say that's 100 so we have the number of columns is the width divided by that resolution and the number of rows is the height divided by that resolution and I am also I need an array of tiles and eventually I'm going to need a player so I got an array of tiles and I've got a player I have the grid that I'm thinking of columns and rows but my tiles it's just gonna be an array so what I'm going to do is I'm gonna say for let I equals 0 I is less than columns times rows that's how many tiles columns times rows I plus plus I'm gonna try to get myself some more room to see the code and then what I'm gonna do I'm gonna make a new tile let tile be a new tile and I'm gonna give that tile I actually care right now I'm gonna just give it like arbitrary location like 100 I have to think about the location in a second and then I'm going to say the next tile is I plus 1 so it gets a location and the next tile is the next one I plus 1 so I make this tile and maybe I give it its size is also that resolution variable let's make that resolution so the idea is now I go into my tile constructor I need an X a Y a size and the next tile so those are the arguments of the constructor every time I make a tile XY size and the next tile okay what what how am i doing is this gonna work I think it's gonna work now I really got to think though how do i hmm I have an idea why don't I what would make what would actually be a little bit better here is for me to think about how do I get that XY location so I know the first tile is down here right so how does that work the first tile the X is 0 and the Y is the number of one times that resolution right so that's where that starts and then each X just goes over a hundred more so let's try that so let's say the first tiles X is zero and the first tiles Y is the number of rows minus one times resolution and I'm going to then make the tile at that X&Y and by the way I'm a tile object I better do something with it so I'm going to once I make it put it in my array so I can access it later now once I make that first tile all I need to do is say hey x equals x plus resolution so the next tile is in the next spot right here now what happens when I get to here once I get past the width I need to move up and then start going that way hmm so I'm gonna need a direction that's keeping track of where I'm which way I'm going I'm just saying let Gir equal one so it's plus resolution times the direction and then when when when and by the way I'm sure there's lots of much more efficient ways of doing this it's like my caveat that I have to give constantly while I program terribly if X is greater than width or equal to if it gets to the end I don't want then what I need to do is say X minus equals resolution go back and say Y minus equals resolution so I want to move up and when we back and direction x equals negative one so now it'll what that's gonna do is this is gonna I'm gonna get to the end so I move back move up that's my next tile and then the next time I'm gonna start moving X this way so that if X is less than or equal to zero same thing I'm going to go pull plus the writ no I'm gonna stay I need to stay there because I'm doing this thing where I'm gonna be drawing the tiles from their left side that's why I'm gonna got to the end I just kind of slide back when I get to here though I'm fine right there x equals resolution Y goes up and direction switches so you know there's there's a nice way I could probably combine these if statements to one let's leave it like that for now I have no idea if this algorithm is right and what I'm going to do though to find out is just go and look at all the tiles and draw them so I'm gonna say tiles index i/o and I've been using my of loop let's use the of loop why not right so I'm gonna say for let tile of tiles and then tile dot you know render display and I let's let's call it render show as a show like show put it on the show its tiles tiles tiles you know anything I can do to somewhat tie myself to a musical theater I attempt to very poorly okay pause for a second this computer has gone to sleep yeah why modulus two could determine direction that's a good idea of somebody huh did I get it wrong that the game someone is saying the game starts at the on the right I've always thought of the game starting here but maybe that's the American version because we read from left to right but who knows yeah so so III I'm kind of breaking out for a second just to answer a question definitely starts and ends left so you mean it actually ends all the way over here so it doesn't end over here why did I think that I play by the way superhero chutes and ladders I've also played Peppa Pig chutes no Peppa Pig chutes and ladders is my favorite chutes and ladders sorry now I messed up for machiya because I went out of the video he made your bud that I looked at okay oh it does okay alright so matchy oh sorry all of that was edited and I'm gonna return back and just oh there's an edit point there because we're some nice comments from the chat pointing out that the actual original version of the game does in fact start here and end at the top a perfect square which so that's the actual version of the game I also got a good comment which what I could do is you said two loops for the columns and rows and then check if the Y is an odd or even row to like move this way or that way but I'm gonna leave my goofy system in there but I will actually have it end up there so it's I would you want to say that the the peppa pig version of chutes and ladders that i play quite often actually I think ends over here go check that tonight when I get home or I'll put something in the copy in the comment about the Peppa big chutes and ladders there will be wandering I'm sure okay so so here we go let's let's do this let's make it a square then let's call show and so now what I need to do is I need to write that function show and I'm gonna I'm gonna give each tile like a random color just so just so I can see them and I'm gonna say draw a rectangle at the x value of the Y value and that width and height and then I'm going to draw fill with this color okay so we should see point by weight what I just did here is kind of terrible I wrote so much code before I actually attempted to run any of it my advice that I would give anybody when I try to do is and I'm sorry for my green paper bleeding out there there is I should have I should have been testing stuff more frequently but here we go okay tile is not defined well why is tile not defined number one is I didn't bother to include in my HTML file the tile javascript file and or the player javascript file and I don't think the order really matters here but I want to put the player first in the tile second in the sketch last okay hey that looks pretty good let's write the numbers in of the next tile in the tile so let's say tech just for justice just for debugging text this dot next actually I kind of want to know its own index just out of curiosity right why not have the tile I don't know that I need this but I will kind of want to see I want to see this dot index and this dot next kind of in the tile and let's say text size 64 no text size like yeah 4832 and what am I looking for I need to give it an x and y location so I'll give it its X and it's Y location so I just want to see that this is working correctly and one undefined that's not good oh because what I forgot that I made I did this idea of having the tile know about its index but I didn't bother to pass in I 0 to 1 so why is only this one showing me oh because no y is only Y is only this one showing me the text so if we thought I mean I could use my matrix what did I do wrong here that I'm only seeing the text of one of them so let's look at the tiles this is there 16 of them these look like reasonable locations for them these look like reasonable index indices and next values so somehow might like fancy drawing for debugging has failed me so the first column is missing after the first row okay hold on is this Deepa interesting debugging or not interesting to you baby what is wrong here look at this there's some negative wise stuff that can't be right so why starts at zero 100 200 300 that's right 100 200 300 then this goes to 200 the X is 300 200 100 uhoh 1 there's no zero there so how come the zero oh I need to mmhmm okay so my algorithm is wrong I had this like idea in my head that I was not going to get that my algorithm is just totally wrong because I want to basically what this should say is negative resolution right I'm in a place where I don't want to be if I gone all the way one off and then I do need to add back the resolution so actually this can be one let's make this one if statement if I'm at the either end then I should add the resolution times the direction times negative one then I mean I could change the direction first let's change the direction first then I could add the resolution times the direction and then go up a row and then I don't need this now let's try this okay I have them all there they look like they're in the right spot am I not draw oh you know why I'm not seeing them because I'm actually drawing the text at the top which is it's gonna appear but then the other one draws over it so for example what I want to do is say actually to draw the text at this dot why how come I can't get to this part of my code over to the right Oh cuz I moved it no oh yes what have I done this dot y plus resolution boy am I making this silly and complicated ah resolution is not defined why why is it not defined I believe it to be defined it is this dot wh resolution was the terrible that I used in my setup function the height the dimensions is called wh in the object okay there we go zero goes to 1 1 goes to 2 2 goes to 3 3 goes to 4 4 goes by the way the reason why I'm doing this is because if it's a snake 4 is not going to go to 5 4 would go down to 2 so that's why I've set up this structure but at least I have all of them there and I have now the next things alright alright so we don't need this debugging stuff anymore and in fact what might be useful is actually to make it maybe I should just make it just so we can view it like a checkerboard pattern let's that might make it easy to see so what I could do is say here in the constructor if I modulus if index if it's an even 1 then make the color white otherwise this color equals black so now if I do that we see the nice little checkerboard pattern I'm not drawing the text anymore and there we go let's be a little less extreme about it and say 200 and 100 there we go so this is now the board now I need a player I need a player I have a player object so I'm going to go to the sketch and I'm gonna say after I've set up the board player equals a new player then what can the player do the player can be seen the player can roll so the player can roll so what does the roll mean by roll I mean like roll a dice die or spin a wheel roll so I want to pick a random number and I'm gonna use the p5 random function to give me a random number between 1 and it is 0 an option in snakes and ladders what are the what are the actual roll possibilities one I'm just gonna say right now between 1 and 4 I'm going to make that floor and I'm going to say this dot spot plus plus equals R then show is and I I guess what I want to do is I need to maybe if I give it the show function the array of tiles what I need to do is say current equals tile index this dot spot so I can look up where it is which tile and then maybe in that tile I can say draw an ellipse let's make an ellipse the player could have a color I'll just say white for right now let's draw an ellipse at maybe what I'll do is I'll write a little function that like equal tile get Center and it can give me like a little you can just give me a little array with the X and the y back of the center of the tile just so I can and so just you know why not let's write center here and I can say the center x equals this dot X plus this WH divided by 2 and the center Y is this dot Y and then return a little array with both those values in it could make a vector object or something I'm gonna call this get get center and then oh oh this might be a good opportunity to use like the es6 getters and setters who I'm not gonna bother come back to that sometime so then in the player I get the center and then I could say center 0 for X and Center 1 for Y and I'm gonna make a little nice little 32 by 32 diameter little circle okay so tile is not defined in player dodge yes line 12 why is it not defined in player Dutch yes line 12 well because when in the sketch I call show I didn't pass it in the tiles and let's do this tile is not to find still in player j/s oh this is tiles thank you very much well how many times can I have tile not defined Oh current this is current get center now there we go oh look did you see that little you see a little game get played so now I need an any condition let's just say roll is rolling and moving so I should have a roll yeah it's probably a roll and then a move but uh maybe I'll separate those out later I need a condition for ending the game so maybe what I'll do is I will do that just out in the main program and I will say if player dot spot is greater than is greater than tiles dot length then are greater than or equal then not length minus one that's the last rater than or equal to right then the player is there at the end and I could make a more complex logic that you have to land on the last spot just go let you overshoot it equals that and console.log game over and I can say no loop all right I'm just gonna do that for right now yes I'm gonna change it to a 10 by 10 grid in a second all right so this is great so now the game is playing I could slow down the frame rate I could show what the role is so many things I could do to make this nicer let's at least make this 10 by 10 there we go so now we're watching the game being played a simulation of the game being played now here's the interesting thing what's interesting about snakes and ladders and the reason why it's is it kind of like relevant to a discussion of Montecarlo systems in this book is because and thank you again to name.we Clark at the game center for talking about this last weekend is that in this scenario we can actually write a mathematical formula to compute the mean average amount of rolls it would take to win the game let's at so we could do that right we could figure out like well if you can only roll a 1 2 or 3 and there's 16 spots for your average roll is a 2 so maybe that'll take maybe about eight eight rolls on average I think that's probably the appropriate mat I probably got it wrong you could fix me in the comments but the whole point of snakes and ladders is I could add a snake here I could add a ladder here this is going to increase the drama the fun of the game make it seem more complex but then there's not I mean try to come up with a formula that if you have a big complicated board lots of snakes and ladders that's gonna compute the average amount of rolls it takes to win the game not so easy however what I could do is just run the thing randomly hundreds of thousands of times or thousands of times or hundreds of times however many times I need and compute the average that way so that's what's known as kind of a Monte Carlo simulation and before by trying just running something through randomly making a lot of random selections before there were computers there were books of random numbers like this one all right so let's go what am I gonna do now let's have it run many many times and let's have it continuously display the average amount of rolls so so I don't know I've kind of gone a little I'm kind of gone off with a little tangent here if you're watching this make us into a creative fun game that you could actually play I'm gonna go this simulation route okay so now so now let's keep track of rolls average rolls all right and games plate so rolls of the number of rolls during one version of the game game played increases and average rolls is the number of rolls a minute I could keep a running average I could keep trying to keep track of a history let's let's say rolls is in hey we'll make it array then I don't need games played it's just the length all right so so but I do need the current rolls all right you just have the current yeah current I'll just have a variable called index into that so every time every frame is everytime I roll then rolls index plus plus all right then so I'm increasing the number of rolls then when the game's over the index goes to the next spot in the array I don't say no loop rather what I do is I start the game over so what do I do to start the game over first let me show first let me let me do this after I show the player oh no cuz oh boy Oh time out for a second I just this computer keeps going to sleep okay wait alright so here's the thing what's happening here i I'm done stick at the end the game is over go to the next one well do I want to see that I finished would be nice to see so what I probably should do is what I'm gonna do is actually just say game over this is terrible I would say game over equals false game over equals true and then I'm gonna deal with the game over logic separately down here if game over I think all I need to do is player reset the player right reset the player and have the index go up right reset the player and have the index go up and the player then needs a function called reset where this dot spot goes back to zero there we go all right I think I might have gotten all this stuff in there just try running it see what happens yeah the game is playing over and over again let's see rolls numbered and convert odd enough further that's not a good sign oh did I not did I forget to initialize the rolls at zero so what I need to do is when the game starts I need to say rolls at index and I want to put the game by the way back to a four by four just sort of play faster roles index equals zero and then when I increase the index I should say roles index and there's probably more elegant way terrible disarray but the next role starts at zero okay so now let's look at the roles there we go nine nine eight nine eight eight eight three does that make sense it's taking about that many roles that's kind of like wow did it in three roles whoops how could it's do it in zero something's wrong with the lehto because the last one is the current one I'm actually looking at it before it's finished so now when I do the average that makes sense so now what I want to do is calculate the average and you do that in sketch so sum equals zero I should use one of those nice array I could use the reduce array function and I need to go all the way up to roles dot length minus one because the current role does not count in part as part of the average and then I need to say sum plus equal roles index I and then the average is the sum divided by the roles dot length but minus one because there's one fewer and then what I can do is I can just say console let me let me actually make a Dom element on the page I will just say in the sketch I will say average P average P equal to create P and now I'm gonna say average P which is the average paragraph HTML average okay okay everybody settle down so this is the average amount of times it is now taking which I didn't I say eight so I think I'm about right but average amount of times it's taken to complete the game and it's probably a little bit less because I'm starting on the first spot that's why it's a little bit less I didn't actually should start at negative one let's start at let's start at the player should start at negative one and it would make sense from you by the way in the constructor to just call this dot reset right here I think that'll work so we can see now we have that math that I did in my brain appears to be correct because we're kind of through the Monte Carlo method getting that number of eight okay yes and I could have done a running average but I didn't I want to but I got afraid all right how long has this been so far this is one of these long challenges people really watch these things oh no anybody can stand to watch them all right now oh I didn't yes I did oh I didn't change it to negative one oh that's weird I just got lucky I guess now it's taking a little bit longer was I just wrong before about putting it to negative one 2048 it's simpler okay anyways company apologies for this little blip here but I've been trying you're starting at zero it's starting it at 1 I don't know what to do let negative 1 let's start it at negative 1 so you're off the board I think that makes more sense yes ok so now let's start thinking about the exciting part the exciting part now what I need to do is start adding some snakes and ladders so let's just add now how should be theirs I guess there's how should I configure I could make them random let me make some manual ones so what I'm gonna do is manually override the board to make some snakes and ladders so what I'm going to do and I will put it back to 10 by 10 in a second but this is a little simpler for me so if I go into here in the sketch where I'm making the board after I'm done making the board what I could do is I could just say something like tiles index 6 dot next equals 1 so this would be in a four by four board 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 this would be a snake that would go down OH I got one whatever but let's make it aa this is confusing because the numbers I put here are dot started with 0 so but the array in actual counted 0 so but you get the idea it's in whatever the indexes is gonna point to the other ones so a couple things one is what I think that I would like to do so let's do this index 6 the next is 1 which is actually the second tile what I would like to do this is a little bit goofy as I could just I could also just say tiles index six dots snake equals true so I could give it a property like snake equals true but I could also just kind of figure this out right because in the tile itself when I'm about to draw it I could say if this dot next does not is does not equal to this dot index plus one right if it's not if the next tile is not the one right after it then it has to be a snake so what I want to do is draw I want to do a good thing I have that um my Center my C equals get this dot get center and next see these are very awkward variable names equals oh I I don't have access to the global variable tiles here but I could pass it in so when I say show when I draw them all this is very weird what I'm doing here I probably would want to refactor this later do it some different way I'm gonna Pat Isles is a global variable so I could get access to it that way but I like the idea of passing it in just to sort of for sanity's sake I could say tiles this taught next dot get Center and then I could draw a line let's say stroke wait for stroke 255 line from where my C 0 my C 1 next see why am I making these weird blames my Center next Center my Center 0 my Center 1 next Center 0 next Center 1 okay there look there's my snake now here's the thing is it actually working is it actually causing it to go down there if it ever lands on there I think it is because it's always going to where the next thing is and I don't really like I want to make a more interesting looking snake so let's pick a different tile like 9 how about 10 so it's a loose diagonal there we go okay so now let's slow this down a little bit frame rate 10 boy very hard for me to see if this is working right is it actually going to the next spot oh I don't think I actually told you to go to the next pot I would just tell 2 plus plus so let's take a look at that when the player moves oh it just moves the spot up but it can't do that anymore it can't do that anymore it has to examine its spot Oh weird so what it really should do is so we've to have the tiles here oh this is getting very awkward this is a very awkward game I'm making it's gonna have the tiles here and what it's going to do is in the player object it's going to take its spot and move up by this number and then it's going to say oh yeah this is why it would be nice for it to actually have a boolean variable as to whether because it's it's the act of landing on it so I need to check something when I land on it whether it should move to the next thing so you know what here's what I'm gonna do this in a different way I got an idea I've got an idea what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make each tile next is kind of unnecessary I don't know I'm not sure exactly why I have that in there anymore but I'm gonna say this dots snake equals zero and this dot ladder equals zero so they all have a snake and ladder of zero zero means well no it could be in this case there can never be a snake that takes you all the way back to the first spot so I'll have a snake and ladder of negative one all right negative one means no snake no ladder I could say false or something but anyway I'm gonna do that then in the sketch I'm not going to override the next just gonna say it's snake is one so now when I am when I am rendering the tile instead of checking the next thing which is kind of nuts I'm going to say if this snake is greater than zero I'm gonna draw that like ah but the next oh yeah and then I just go to the I draw the line from it to this dot snake it's greater than negative one or and maybe the well I'm gonna do these total is this silly I'm gonna do these as two separate if statements if this dot latter is greater than one and I could obviously condense these into one statement which I will eventually at some point in my life if this that latter is greater than one booyeah I'm still doing this project what the I was it's like five o'clock ass this dot ladder is greater than one then the ladders will be black all right so now let's take a look at this so I've still got the snake in there now what happens when the player rolls if the tile is tiles index this dot spot if this dot spot snake oh you know what I could do I could have the snake be a negative number and the zero means there's nothing this would be better let's do it a different way I got a better idea so by definition what should we call it snake ladder it's a snake either a snake or a ladder the tile spot the spot is right is it a snake snake or ladder they're all equal to zero it's a snake or ladder if it's equal to zero and when I create it I'm gonna say the snake or ladder is like negative five meaning go back five spots this is so much better so much better even though my variable names snicker glad it's got a terrible so now what I can do is in the tile hmm when I'm drawing it if snake or ladder is not equal to zero right then I've got to draw a line from this index plus okay so thus this snake for ladder that's it's the difference between where I am where I'm currently going to go back to and I draw that line and then I don't need this whole second nonsense thing and then of course in the player if it lands if this snake or ladder does not equal is not a zero then this dot spot plus equals that goes back to wherever it goes dare I say I have this now all right cannot read property get center of undefined player s line 23 current get center tiles this dot spot because I started at negative one have I not moved yet tile snake or current equals tiles I'm mmm no it's time to add a move I really should add a move function okay fine hold on let's my my error might be because I'm really being silly about this why do I need a move function can I just roll it and move I don't want a move function where's my error here what was line 23 current is not defined so what is this dot spot there let's see what that is not a number so why is that not a number probably because of what this computer went to sleep oh yeah yeah you know I'm getting a great comment in the chat from Dennis who writes I don't need this I don't need this if statement because if it's zero it's not gonna change oh this is probably the problem I must have messed this up somehow so this plus equals snake our letter let's look at console dot log this dot spot this seems like it's the problem console dot log this snake or ladder it's probably my variable name it's the problem undefined so why is this undefined oh because it's not this it is the tile it is the tiles maker ladder of course the player is at a spot the tile is telling it where to go and by the way people were telling me this in the chat so I think I'm gonna try to feel confident that that's gonna fix it now and now get Center player twenty undefined no problem no problem Oh tile I didn't actually fix it weirdly enough okay let's try this again alright so oh you I see because the reason why I need a move is because I want to draw it there and then I want to draw it the next like I want to see it land there and see it go down like animation wise I kind of want to see it land there and go down okay first of all why did this happen player dot s line ten so if I got if I'm off the board here so what I what I do need to say is I do need this though if tile exists so as long as there is a tile there that'll fix that okay now it is working we can see cuz you can see it on but I don't like the fact that I don't see it land there so this I don't like the fact that I don't see it land there so what I think that I want to do is I want I do need that move function so I do need that move function because what I'm going to do is I'm going to do this aspect in the move function so move is a function that is going to deal with the snakes and ladders e thingy roll is just moving based on your role because then what I can do is I can roll move roll move because if I want to animate one versus the other and this is a little bit silly boy I have really gone off the deep end here with this but like then I but I kind of want to what I want to do is I want to say something like if if rolls index is is even like I want to do like one or the other like cuz I want to draw it where it landed and then I want to move it to the next thing which is gonna be awkward though cuz I only want to draw an extra oh I've done what I said I didn't want to do which is getting into the animating oh this is terrible but it isn't so bad actually so oops roll and then player dot move and tile so this is I this is I kind of I've loved I've I'd make my die sixsided yeah okay tile is not defined sketch j/s tiles oh wait wait wait wait wait oh no no no no first this doesn't make any sense because once I'm in here I never go again so if I want to do every other I can't actually keep track of the rolls because this is in a roll I could use just like the frame count which is going to be a problem because who knows what that's going to do but in the chat it says I feel like this is so much more complicated than it needs to be story of my life you know what four five ten mmhmm so what I'm going to do now and we think about this what's a good what what can I do that's gonna be good here forget about this idea of animating it I told you I didn't need the silly move thing let's go backwards let's go backwards forget about that edit that out because a little bit shorter okay so I could I kind of would like to at some point do something where it lands there and then animates going to the next step but I'm gonna like skip worrying about that right now I'm just going to this is working right you can see that it's taking me an average of about 12 now with this one little blip now what I can do so first of all I want those ladders to be a different color so what I'm gonna do here in the tile is if the this is going to be stroke wonder if this would actually work 255 I well I could do one of those what are those things called those fancy little if statements you do in one space here what is called again somebody tell me who told you survives in 2048 what's that what could I never remember that I don't use them I'm just gonna say I'm gonna do my own nice little way of doing this in a really ridiculous way if this maker ladder is less than zero then it's going to be that is a snake otherwise it is a ladder okay so let's look at this now what I'm going to do is I'm going to configure in this main sketch a couple more of these oh let's make it let's make it let's make it 10 by 10 where do I do that again I change the resolution to 40 and now I've got a lot of stuff to work with I've got a hundred tiles so what I'm gonna do actually I'm gonna just pick make some randomly because I kind of wanna I don't want to figure it out so I'm gonna just miss they let a equals 0 I is less than five I'm gonna have five snakes and five ladders and I could so I'm gonna pick I'm gonna pick a random tile and I'm gonna say tile dot snakes or ladder equals a random negative number between negative 10 and negative negative 1 this is doubt I could have a serious problem here but I'm not gonna worry about it just yet then I'm gonna do this between 1 and 10 and actually it doesn't make sense for his ladder to go horizontally it's got to go on to a different row so that so it doesn't make sense actually for any whoops if I'm picking them randomly it doesn't make sense for any of the snakes to be in the first row and any of the ladders to be in the last row all right so I should probably account for that so I can't just pick a random tile like I want to do this well but I also want to do it quickly and not worry about it but let's let's be thoughtful about this so random I guess I have to pick an index so I want to pick there's a certain number of qov there's a certain number of columns so I can say I want to pick a random where am i doing that I want to pick a random index between for a snake it can't be in the bottom so it has to be the first one would be columns two tiles dot length so that's a random index and then that in debt that would get a random amount whoops what is that that would get a random negative number and it should be them by minimum it has to be the number right it's got to go be at least the number of kala good you know if it's kind of earlier in the thing it could point down I don't know I just make it in between columns and oh and then all the way back to oh the difference between what's the Mac okay let's figure this out this is worth doing nuts okay let's say I pick this here the only valid places that I would have a snake going to this would be the first one and this would be the last one so the range is between its index well it depends on which torretta its index oh there's got to be some nice math for this this is four by four the number of columns modulus yeah yeah that's always going to be the case the number of columns not the number College moment that its index module sorry sorry its index its index modulus the number of columns so that's gonna get me at a minimum here and then the bottom is just you know I don't want anything to be able to go past so so that's where it can be oh oh so they I don't know I I don't need so I could just pick the range between index modulus columns that's that's the smallest amount and not the smallest it's a bit largest amount in the case of negative numbers and then all the way to the bottom would be itself itself one itself one index minus one so this should work but this is that okay I think it'll work for picking random ones so this is going to be a random number between what did I say it was between its negative its index plus one I'm actually gonna just you know what I'm gonna do this is so silly I'll just make this negative one this doesn't allow me to understand the range much more easily index modulus columns and then index minus one so that is that is for a snake and I don't feel like doing two of these so I'm just going to say I'm gonna I'm gonna do ten and if I modulus 2 equals 0 then D I uh this is a I'm gonna I'm going to say I'm going to say let Direction equal 1 otherwise Direction equals negative 1 because the numbers should work out the same way in terms of going to the top no they don't work they don't work the same way in terms of going to the top because if I need to go to the top I've got to subtract the length not zero so there's a lot more option to go to the top design the board I was gonna hard code the numbers alright let's do this let's do this so this is going to be the rain let's just do some snakes let's just see if we get some snakes ok index is not defined sketch J s line forty Oh what am i doing here I have to pick a random index whoa I lost completely lost where I was first I'm picking a random tile so first I want to pick a tile index which is a I had that in here already which is from the second row columns all the way to the end a random number ah I worry it's gonna be okay it's gonna be okay everybody that's the index and then where I've got oh boy and that oh wait there were two lines of code there that's what's going on here and then oh my goodness this that particular tile is this random thing why why why is it Auto formatting this up here what have I done wrong random there we go okay so this is the index right I'm picking some random tile by the way I could take the same tile twice which is a real problem I've got it I've got to deal with that this was a terrible idea oh my goodness a terrible idea then it's snakes or ladder number is some random amount a little bit back all the way to the bottom okay let's take this unexpected token line 43 because I have extra extra brackets okay all right I don't see doesn't look like it picked Danny okay well but it is or am I just not seeing them oh it's is it going down and wait wait so hold on so let's take a look at console.log tiles index snakes or a ladder I should have thought about this okay so we got this one oh there's like I put in multiple variables sometimes I say snake or ladder as soon as I say snakes or leather that is really bad okay so a snake or ladder I think that's what I meant to do I think that's the brothels there we go look look we've got two there there are three snakes one goes from here to there one goes from here to there and one goes from there to here right so we're having trouble getting to the top does it keeps wow it's really good at landing on that one oh it made it past it oh boy well this is exciting though it's actually kind of working all right so my design is horrific first of all one thing I really need to do is when I draw the tiles I need to say when I draw the rectangle I need to say no stroke those I don't make this is much more clear okay so a couple things I should do I'm not gonna I really should make it so I can't pick the same one twice but since I only made three that's not that big of a deal this is actually working Frank amazingly now I'm gonna go back to the sketch and let me pick three ladders so the ladders would be anywhere from right the ladders would be anywhere from the very top oh oh interesting no there's no ladder on the top anywhere from the second row all the way to the bottom so I need to pick an index that goes all the way from 0 to the length minus columns and then I'm going to go up a certain amount so if I were here I'm going to take this you know it's actually columns minus index modulus columns oh that only works though oh no that's fine that's fine because yeah because I I want to know how many up to there so to always go to another row I'll take that instead I'll go up by this much and then the limit is I can only go up by you know laughs maybe the secondtolast spot okay so now I'm going to make some random ones where I'm going to pick a random index so I've got to go from the zero I did that already and then I could go up by columns minus index mod columns and then all the way up to tiles lengths where I am minus one I think that makes sense all right so let's see now if I can get a bunch of ladders there there's a bunch of layers now interestingly enough because of the order I've drawing stuff the ladders get covered over so I should definitely fix that let's see here I've got it I should probably do a pass the tile let me do let me do let me do a this show function it will be by itself and then I'll do show snakes ladders and I'll do all this stuff in there so that I can do that afterwards oh ok so in the so I can do that as a separate loop and so here when I'm when I where am i showing all the tiles here can do this and then I can do tiles that show snakes ladders there we go now here's the thing the question is is this actually I don't can't tell if the ladders are working can anyone see if the ladders are working like is it skipping stuff if it lands on a ladder yeah it did it just went up didn't it just go up there I'm pretty sure it did I'm pretty sure it did yeah and this is pretty bad where I'm you can get awfully get some very unlucky things so interestingly enough right let's just for the sake of argument very quickly I'm gonna I'm gonna run fast again so I'm gonna go back to the sketch if you were really done here I'm gonna take out this slower frame rate I'm gonna take out adding any snakes and ladders and I'm gonna run this really fast so the average should be and by the way I should be allowed to roll us let's let's make it a sixsided die I don't know what what it actually is but let's look in the role let's say you can roll a 1 through 6 which actually would be a 1 through 7 if I'm flooring it I guess I could round it I could do 0 through 6 and round it without actual work no no because then I could get a 0 anyway so let's do this so it can roll a bit more so we could see the average amount is around thirty does that make sense it's a hundred yeah I I'm gonna have to just assume that makes sense that an average it's gonna take about 30 rolls it seemed to be doing a little bit better right now so now let's add in those snakes and ladders oh I look forward to all the much better versions you all make of this and there we go this looks terrible well those ladders are really helping out ladders are really making it way let's look at a different combination well look at this it's a little bit weird you get a snake and then you would get a ladder but you wouldn't because I don't think I check I'm gonna roll again I can't roll the zero I don't check if there's a ladder at the end of your snake so that should be another probably edge condition that I don't allow I don't know if this is gonna turn into a video or not what I'm gonna do is yeah hundred divided by three and a half is that right that the average role of one two three four five six one plus two plus three plus four to five six divided by six I think so so but here's the thing now let's let's really make this insane there we go this one is actually quite easy to win sort of I don't know exactly what's happening there's a lot of ladders connecting but I almost want to watch it really slowly now so let's watch it I should make all of these like variables I can control but let's do framerate one okay I should really display the role you can see here oh whoa oh come on go go make it to the end to the end does anybody boy some animation to help debug or something like console logging would really help here but I think you can see that it just jumped up oh it went back there we go move out to the end all right I don't know what to say you've reached the end of a completely monstrous tangled whee of snakes and ladders I hope you enjoyed this coding challenge I hope that you make a interesting variation of this game you think about the design of it you make it playable there's so many possibilities here thank you for watching this coding challenge as always the code will be available please share your on github and there's a there's a some instructions there how to share your own version so it's linked from the page where I have the code running as well and I look forward to hearing your feedback thank you oh my god okay hold on I think I think I'm gonna need to do there probably some mistakes here all right so here's think I have to go I did fix matters I disappointed everybody who wanted me to do 2048 which probably would have been easier but famous last words this seems like the simplest thing I could ever possibly do so people are saying that it's not working I'm wondering if it's not working like let me let me take a few minutes to debug this a bit more seriously so for example let's make the role only ever a one okay now this would make it and let's let's make fewer let's make fewer of these things two and two okay so now you know it's going very slowly we can at least sort of get us and now of course it's never gonna get past that so let's at least just see that that first snake works yeah I know it's half past I'll be a little bit late to the thing downstairs it's fine okay so that works let me put let me take out the snakes well let me just do this again until I get a nice ladder at the beginning oh look at this it like the the snakes and ladders will affect the stroke of that that's a weird little bug so let me just get it all the way to there we could wait it's not making random moves right now yeah so let's see if it goes back down yeah yeah I think it's working I mean this shows that it's working if I now let me do it with so what would be nice is for me to draw where it's I know what I could do this is why I need a move because I could draw its next spot and then it could good so I think I I wonder if I should come back a little bit later fix this up switch the colors yeah there's not really a point in having two separate ladders what does that mean so I think that it is in fact me it's just now it's just an infinite loop I think it's working even though I botched so much of this I think I should do like a quick little intro to it because I think it's this has to be one video but it's gonna be long and kind of crazy set red color for the snake that makes more sense I'm just trying to think I turn to think about this move animation where I really should show the role it really should have a state yes what this is missing is a state meaning it should have a state here it is now it rolls we see the role now we see where it's going then it goes there is that a snake no role again if it is move to the next spot draw that so I really should keep a state variable to keep track of all that animation stuff the question is do I do that in a separate maybe I'll make that a part two video to like add the animation aspect maybe I'll come back up here in like an hour or could I just do that really quickly let's just see if I can make that a part too just to see just to see what happens I think that'll really help I think that'll really help I'm sure I'm gonna botch this oh yeah two parts the endgame and the snakes and ladders that's kind of a good idea the thing is I don't know if it makes sense I can't ever decide whether that's better just have one long video or multi two more multiple smaller part videos I don't ever know about this I don't know if anybody I mean there's probably like I correct YouTube's algorithm answer to that but eyeball want to know what's like more interesting and useful to view feel something vibrating I do have to go but I feel like I could be like 10 minutes late it'll be fine you never see the intervals all right all right I don't know where this is gonna go or what let's see all right I'm now going to add I really just need a state I really need to see the animation this is sort of like terrible that I've done in this sort of like monstrous Frankenstein version of snakes and ladders what I want to do is I'm gonna keep a variable in my call it state and there's gonna be really three states there's the I'm rolling to see where I'm going to go then there's the state of I'm going to the next spot then there's the state of then there's like optionally a state where I have to fall down or climb up then there's another roll so there's so so if state I'm gonna I could probably there's like a way to use like enums and all sorts of fancy I'm just gonna keep track of these numbers so state equals zero that's the very first thing we do and if state equals zero we're going to roll okay we're going to roll then what I need to do is and I'm gonna put this in here right now is show the the player I wonder if actually I should redraw anything thinking about thinking about this if state is yeah make three parts for each part have an intro a good idea assignment if state is here I want to roll and the player is going to have a I'm going to make the function called roll dice or roll it and the roll is an actual number so the roll we get the roll now temporarily the player is also going to know it's next and we should put this all in reset its next spot right so I want the player always know like it's spot and it's next spot where it's where it rolled to because that will help I think so I'm going to say okay great so hold on I'm gonna stop this I gotta go I'm gonna come back I'm gonna come back because I could just do this little bit I just got to go to this thing for like an hour I'll come back in an hour which will be in the middle of the night for most of you I'm gonna think about whether how this should get divided up yeah dice is plural dicing or I'm gonna I'm gonna come back so this is good you can also you can tweet me your suggestions for how to fake this better act Schiffman I'm gonna come back a little bit later in like an hour I really gotta go and finish this what are these days I'm gonna have to like a schedule and then things are gonna make sense I'm gonna come back all right thank you everybody this was gonna like abruptly stop right now I'm gonna leave everything on and when I come back up I'm going to press start streaming again my guess would be probably in around one hour okay so I will see you then
