00:05 - hate having to enter but anyway hi
00:08 - Spriggs this video is gonna be about
00:10 - spring forces spring forces is Boeing
00:12 - Boeing Boeing okay so what did we just
00:15 - look at little punchy we just looked at
00:18 - a pendulum and what we're really looking
00:21 - at was an idealized pendulum
00:22 - the arm of that pendulum we didn't
00:26 - really simulate the fact that it you
00:27 - know it couldn't bend at all
00:32 - contributing
00:34 - well the spring is a similar situation
00:36 - to a pendulum which we could represent
00:37 - as a bob hanging from perhaps some
00:41 - origin point but instead of hanging from
00:43 - this idealized rod a fixed length
00:47 - instead we have this elastic arm this
00:50 - elastic arm that in fact can be expanded
00:52 - and contracted and thus a force is gonna
00:55 - suddenly you know it's a spring to pull
00:57 - it in Springs I think you know what I'm
00:59 - talking about right so we could
01:01 - represent that by drawing this sort of
01:03 - squiggly springs thing there we go
01:05 - that's nice okay what a nice drawing
01:07 - okay so this is what we're working with
01:09 - a spring now that we've established that
01:11 - let's figure out how would we simulate
01:13 - this how would we get this sort of
01:14 - springy motion oscillating up and down
01:16 - so we know we can do this with with with
01:18 - the sine function with a sine wave we
01:20 - spent a whole video a couple videos back
01:22 - looking at that and that's what's going
01:24 - on right here in this processing example
01:25 - right if we take the result of cosine of
01:28 - an angle and map it to some range then
01:30 - and we use that for the Y value of
01:32 - something it's moving up and down it
01:33 - looks like a spring the thing about this
01:36 - is while we have the simulation on the
01:38 - screen it doesn't integrate with
01:40 - anything we've done before what we
01:42 - really want is this spring coming up and
01:45 - down but in addition to going up and
01:47 - down a wind force could blow on it
01:49 - gravity could happen you could bonk it
01:51 - to it you could connect other Springs it
01:52 - could be a whole set of forces all being
01:54 - applied to this object so we need to
01:57 - look at instead of just kind of using a
01:59 - kind of trigonometry sine cosine trick
02:02 - to make that oscillating motion we
02:03 - really need to look at modeling a spring
02:05 - force how do we do that let's go over
02:08 - here shall we
02:10 - okay so spring forces are modeled using
02:13 - something called Hookes law wrote this
02:15 - down over there Hookes law in Latin is I
02:20 - can't pronounce but maybe nobody can
02:21 - pronounce Latin or whatever
02:22 - ooh tensio sic vis translates to as the
02:26 - extension so the force and it would be
02:28 - nice if like the letters just of that
02:29 - appeared in front of me but that's not
02:31 - gonna happen right now but what we're
02:32 - talking about is we're saying the force
02:34 - of a spring is directionally directly
02:36 - proportional to the extension of the
02:38 - spring right the more we stretch that
02:40 - spring out the stronger that force the
02:42 - more we contract the spring the stronger
02:45 - the force a spring it at rest won't have
02:47 - any force and Hookes law is typically
02:49 - written as follows F equals negative K
02:53 - times X so what are these values has
02:59 - with just about everything we were
03:00 - looking at in this series of videos
03:03 - about something we've got a constant
03:06 - right K is a constant you know it
03:08 - probably has some real-world numbers for
03:09 - different kinds of Springs but for us
03:10 - it's just allowing us to tweak tweak the
03:13 - behavior of our spring is it a really
03:15 - elastic spring or it's a kind of a rigid
03:17 - spring try a higher constant try a lower
03:19 - constant you'll see what happens deep
03:22 - breath what is X X is the displacement
03:26 - right we talked about the force of the
03:29 - spring displacement well that kind of
03:31 - says the displacement the force of the
03:32 - spring being proportional to the
03:33 - extension of the spring X is that
03:35 - extension how what is the difference
03:37 - between the actual length of the spring
03:40 - and the rest length so this is something
03:42 - that's really important a spring has a
03:45 - rest length that is the length of the
03:48 - spring will naturally kind of gravitate
03:50 - towards at rest that's where it will sit
03:52 - without moving without springing at all
03:54 - as soon as we displace it from that rest
03:56 - position will let go it's gonna spring
03:58 - back and forth so this is great now one
04:01 - thing that you know I just noticed
04:04 - something about this formula so this is
04:06 - gonna be a vector right we're gonna
04:08 - we're gonna have a spring that's in a
04:09 - two dimensional world and so this is
04:13 - actually really just telling us the
04:14 - magnitude of the force this is how
04:18 - strong it is the force that the
04:20 - magnitude of the force it's stronger
04:22 - with a high constant
04:23 - big displacement it's weaker with a low
04:26 - constant and no displacement but with as
04:29 - with any vector and calculating any
04:31 - force we need both the magnitude and the
04:34 - direction how are we gonna get that
04:35 - direction let's see let's see I think
04:38 - it's pretty obvious right okay so let's
04:40 - think about this for a second
04:41 - let's take me let me draw this spring
04:44 - again let's say this is kind of
04:46 - representing the springs rest link
04:48 - that's the spring rest length but we
04:50 - we've stretched it out and we've pulled
04:54 - it down to here well what's the
04:56 - direction of the force
04:57 - clearly visually we can see the
04:59 - direction of the force is a vector that
05:01 - points back from the Bob to the origin
05:03 - so we're gonna be able to do this we
05:07 - know that if we know this as a location
05:11 - origin and this we're calling the Bob
05:14 - and maybe this Bob is going to be an
05:16 - object with a location we can make a
05:19 - vector that points from the Bob's
05:21 - location to the origin and then we can
05:24 - calculate its magnitude by saying
05:25 - negative the display negative some
05:28 - constant times that displacement how do
05:30 - we know that displacement well look at
05:32 - this this I would say is the current
05:36 - length current length so we have the
05:39 - rest length and the current length what
05:42 - if X equal to X is equal to current
05:46 - minus rest what is the difference
05:49 - between the current length of the spring
05:51 - and its rest length here we can see it's
05:54 - you know it's going to be some number
05:56 - it's longer you can see here that if we
05:58 - were to kind of shrink that spring like
06:01 - push it all the way in right this is
06:03 - still our rest length we push the spring
06:05 - all the way in that displacement it's
06:08 - going to be a negative number and so
06:10 - that's going to reverse the direction of
06:11 - the force so then that force would push
06:13 - it out so you know if you ever saw all
06:16 - of these simulations of stuff on the
06:17 - screen which is like springing bouncing
06:20 - all this that looks kind of cool it's
06:21 - all spring anything that's physics and I
06:22 - can't handle that
06:23 - look at this formula I don't think we've
06:25 - looked at it for a force this simple I
06:29 - mean we had like you know numerators and
06:32 - denominators and other formulas and
06:34 - Greek letters this is really simple I
06:35 - mean I suppose the Hookes law
06:37 - in Latin so that was a little bit hard
06:38 - but but here we've just got negative K
06:40 - times X awesome and we know about
06:43 - vectors I'm pretty sure we can do this
06:45 - okay now what I want to do is kind of
06:49 - start putting some code together that's
06:51 - gonna make that's gonna simulate the
06:52 - spring force and then we'll talk about a
06:54 - big question in it here's how do we
06:56 - really organize this program in an
06:57 - object-oriented way and i am recording
06:59 - this so i haven't wasted my time so far
07:02 - you know that last video the penciled
07:04 - one I didn't stop to say it was
07:05 - recording which was a good thing okay
07:06 - but and we've been going about seven
07:08 - minutes good okay I got to stop talking
07:09 - about that I'm making a video you guys
07:10 - know that I'm doing that okay hi here we
07:12 - are now we're over here so we look at
07:14 - this oscillating one it's very hot in
07:16 - here and I'm gonna close this out and
07:18 - let's look at this one so one thing I
07:21 - should notice whose is that one thing
07:23 - that we should notice I should notice
07:24 - you should notice we should all notice
07:26 - we should all notice is that the bob is
07:29 - now a mover object we didn't have that
07:33 - with the pendulum our pendulum example
07:35 - we kind of did in this simple way where
07:36 - we just dealt with sort of like the
07:37 - vector location of the bob and the
07:39 - vector location the origin we did some
07:40 - trigonometry and it moved we really want
07:42 - to build this in a way that other forces
07:44 - we could blow some wind on it and it
07:46 - would move so that bob is a mover it
07:49 - could experience gravity could
07:50 - experience wind of friction and he made
07:52 - up forces that we had but it also can be
07:55 - connected with a spring force a spring
07:57 - force is just another force we can apply
07:59 - to an object so somewhere at some point
08:02 - if we do this successfully which I'm
08:03 - going to try to do we're eventually just
08:06 - gonna say Bob that apply bob dad Bob dot
08:09 - apply force spring force right this is
08:14 - what we're looking to do we need to
08:16 - calculate that spring force and then
08:18 - apply it to our object can we do that I
08:21 - think we can so let's think about let's
08:24 - remind ourselves the magnitude of the
08:26 - force is negative some constant times
08:30 - the displacement okay so in order to do
08:33 - that we need to figure out what is the
08:35 - displacement I forget it let's figure
08:36 - out the direction of the force first
08:38 - we'll get to the magnitude a second
08:40 - let's look at the direction of the force
08:41 - a forces points from the bob to the
08:44 - origin so origin is a vector that's its
08:48 - location Bob
08:50 - is a mover and the Bob's location is ah
08:54 - scroll up edit edit this out of this out
08:56 - the table location is a vector inside of
09:00 - the mover class so we can make a vector
09:04 - I'm just going to call it direction
09:05 - which equals I'm gonna subtract the
09:09 - Bob's location - the origin okay now
09:14 - we've got that direction vector the
09:17 - Bob's location - the origin hey you know
09:19 - what we need to know we need to know the
09:21 - current length of the spring because
09:23 - we're gonna compare that to the rest
09:24 - length by the way the rest length is
09:26 - just a nice little variable that's set
09:27 - up to be 200 so that's fixed here this
09:29 - spring has a rest length of 200 we need
09:31 - to know the current length well just so
09:33 - happens we just made a vector that
09:34 - points from the origin to the Bob you
09:36 - know what the current length of that
09:38 - spring is it's the length of that vector
09:40 - so I'm gonna make a variable called
09:42 - current length and just say really
09:44 - quickly let me ask for the magnitude of
09:46 - that vector so I have the current length
09:47 - cuz I'm gonna need that once we've done
09:49 - that I can normalize that vector
09:53 - now that we've normalized that vector
09:55 - it's of length 1 and I can scale it
09:57 - appropriately later ok what do we need
10:00 - we need a constant K I got one I got one
10:03 - for a really good constant oh it was
10:06 - gonna be a good one one point one that's
10:08 - not a good one
10:08 - the selim constant oh well you think of
10:10 - something better okay that's a constant
10:12 - point one I don't know that sounds good
10:13 - maybe we're gonna need to make it
10:14 - smaller maybe we're going to need to
10:15 - make it bigger we'll do something okay
10:18 - that's the constant now now that now we
10:20 - need X the magnitude is negative K times
10:23 - X X is the displacement I'm gonna call
10:25 - it in this example stretch I don't want
10:27 - to ding ding there's a bell ringing
10:30 - which you probably can't hear but it's
10:32 - distracting okay I'm gonna call it
10:35 - stretch the reason why I'm not gonna
10:36 - call it X is because we kind of used the
10:38 - variable X to mean a lot of other things
10:40 - and I don't want to use X to be
10:42 - displacement so I could call a
10:43 - displacement but I'm gonna call it
10:44 - stretch that equals current length minus
10:48 - rest length awesome so we've got the
10:52 - constant K we've got the displacement
10:54 - now we need to do is say all right
10:56 - multiply that force that direction
10:59 - vector by negative K times
11:04 - Treach that's what Hookes law says and
11:06 - then didn't we down here say what are we
11:08 - going to do we're gonna apply that force
11:10 - now we call the dir for direction but
11:13 - then we manipulated it maybe it would
11:14 - have made more sense to call it spring
11:17 - the whole way through
11:18 - and I'm just gonna if I had planned this
11:22 - out better I would have just done that
11:23 - now we've got this variable called
11:25 - spring we did all the calculations and
11:27 - now we're gonna apply that force and
11:29 - we're gonna run it now oh let's ask
11:31 - ourselves a question that's let's just
11:33 - run it nothing's moving why isn't it
11:37 - moving it we want it to move why isn't
11:39 - it moving well here's the thing the rest
11:41 - length is 200 and the Bob's location is
11:44 - that width divided by 2 comma 200 the
11:47 - current displacement is 0 we actually
11:50 - position the Bob at the wrestling so now
11:52 - we can see if this works by just let's
11:54 - just put it a little further down 40
11:56 - pixels down and we see oh it's bringing
11:59 - back and forth right okay whew it's
12:03 - probably better if we did it wrong we
12:04 - had to fix something but you could see
12:05 - it's working now there's some things
12:07 - about this maybe that looks a little too
12:09 - elastic so what can I do I'm want to
12:13 - maybe I want to maybe I want to I'm
12:18 - sorry maybe I want to make it a little a
12:21 - little less I don't really need to do
12:22 - that you can see it's a little less so
12:24 - manipulating K will do quite a few
12:25 - things but perhaps I just want to
12:27 - demonstrate that we could add other
12:29 - forces to this scenario for example and
12:32 - this is going to be kind of dangerous to
12:34 - do this I could make up a force called
12:36 - wind which is just going to be some
12:40 - arbitrary value that I seem to use and
12:42 - if the mouse is pressed let's apply that
12:47 - force just to prove that what we've done
12:49 - is actually created a spring force
12:51 - within a world that can have lots of
12:53 - other forces when I click the mouse you
12:57 - see some wind now oh we lost it now ah
13:00 - maybe we should add it's kind of like
13:02 - going crazy maybe we should actually add
13:04 - a little bit of gravity I didn't really
13:11 - need to do this but I'm sort of
13:14 - demonstrating a point that this spring
13:16 - force is just
13:17 - yet another force and we can see now if
13:20 - I had a little wind it blows but if I
13:24 - let go gravity's gonna pull it back down
13:25 - now there's no dampening of this spring
13:28 - so maybe we want to add some friction so
13:30 - air resistance just sort of dampen the
13:32 - velocity there's lots of things we can
13:34 - do here but look at this this is pretty
13:35 - great we've actually gotten the spring
13:37 - force going okay good job well that's I
13:43 - think this is close to the end here but
13:45 - I kind of want to ask if you have any
13:47 - questions but okay so here's the thing
13:50 - we need to reorganize this code this is
13:52 - a mess uh-huh this makes me very
13:54 - uncomfortable and I I don't like it at
13:56 - all look at all the wood be suspicious
13:58 - of all of this code here doing all these
14:00 - calculations I think it probably makes
14:03 - sense for us to actually have a spring
14:05 - class so I just want to discuss that for
14:07 - a moment okay here I am right okay so we
14:12 - have this spring system I'm erasing
14:16 - everything which has a couple things
14:20 - there is an origin point which I
14:22 - actually might want to call the anchor
14:24 - we can think of that as what the spring
14:26 - is anchored to the spring also has a
14:29 - variable which is the rest length which
14:32 - is very important it's obviously quite
14:35 - crucial in our calculations there is
14:37 - also this Bob but we've already
14:40 - established that the Bob is a mover the
14:42 - Bob is what it's going to have location
14:45 - velocity acceleration we're going to be
14:48 - able to apply forces to it this is
14:52 - something we already have it's the mover
14:54 - so would should we add a function inside
14:57 - the mover which is like a spring
14:58 - function we could we could do what we
15:01 - did over here we should just have a lot
15:03 - of gobbledygook code and draw and then
15:05 - apply a force to the Bob but I think a
15:07 - better solution would be to actually
15:09 - create a spring class and then what
15:14 - would the variables of that spring class
15:16 - be one variable could be the location of
15:22 - the anchor another variable could be the
15:27 - rest length oh my goodness and I forgot
15:29 - something important
15:30 - another variable could be the spring
15:32 - constant k how elastic is the spring how
15:36 - weak is this spring so what we've done
15:38 - is we've said all of the stuff that has
15:40 - to do with the spring that stuff in the
15:43 - spring class all the stuff that has to
15:45 - do with the Bob that's our Bob class are
15:47 - what we've called mover in all of our
15:48 - previous examples we could call this one
15:52 - a shaker now but that's kind of this
15:54 - weird inside joke that makes no sense to
15:56 - anybody right now except for me or a
15:58 - couple of people watching this video
15:59 - okay so what's missing though we need a
16:03 - way of applying the spring of the spring
16:05 - force to the mover object and one
16:08 - suggestion I would have for that is we
16:11 - could add a function in the spring class
16:13 - called connect which connects the spring
16:17 - to a given mover this is going to be
16:19 - incredibly powerful because what it
16:21 - would allow us to do is it allows it to
16:23 - have a system of many Springs of many
16:26 - objects and we could connect this object
16:28 - to this spring and this object to this
16:30 - spring we could make the anchor of one
16:31 - you know this is the opens another
16:33 - question maybe the anchor should
16:35 - actually be another actually moving
16:37 - object we could have a spring without
16:38 - about having a fixed anchor point so
16:40 - there's lots of ways opens up kind of a
16:42 - can of worms of possibilities but what
16:44 - this allows us to do and I think I'll
16:46 - just show this to you in code over here
16:48 - there is a example that I'm hoping is
16:50 - prepared right here in the draw function
16:52 - and there's a lot of some extra stuff
16:54 - this is the line of code this is now
16:56 - example 3.11 if you're falling on one go
16:59 - look in the github repo you can see here
17:02 - we can say spring dot Connect Bob this
17:04 - is now a system where we have a bob
17:07 - object and a spring object we make this
17:09 - spring with a location and a rest length
17:11 - and we make the bob and then at any
17:15 - point we can say spring dot connect Bob
17:17 - so that's the function that handled okay
17:20 - where's the Bob where's the spring
17:21 - what's the current length compare that
17:23 - to the rest length calculate that force
17:25 - apply it to the Bob that all happens
17:26 - inside that function and if we wanted to
17:28 - we could just take a quick look at that
17:30 - we can see this right here this is the
17:32 - exact same algorithm that we typed out
17:34 - ourselves the force is the difference
17:37 - between the Bob's location and the
17:38 - anchor we need to get the stretch which
17:41 - is the displacement that we need to
17:42 - scale that force and apply it to
17:44 - about all of that happens in that
17:45 - function so I don't know I am a little
17:48 - bit obsessed with kind of nice clean
17:50 - object-oriented design but I think this
17:52 - is this is a really flexible scenario a
17:55 - couple things I should mention about
17:56 - this one thing about this spring is you
18:00 - can see this example if you go look at
18:02 - it it constrains the spring so it can
18:04 - never go below a minimum length or a
18:05 - maximum length I mean that's sort of an
18:07 - artificial constraint but it can make
18:08 - the system behave a little nicely a
18:11 - little more nicely and it also has some
18:14 - dampening in it and it also lets the
18:16 - user kind of drag this around so now
18:18 - that we've looked through this scenario
18:19 - I should really say here's the thing so
18:24 - the next set of videos are gonna be
18:25 - about particle systems and then we're
18:26 - gonna start looking at physics libraries
18:28 - you know a spring force is something
18:30 - that other people have thought of and in
18:33 - fact one of the libraries we're gonna
18:34 - look at toxic libs verlet physics
18:36 - package is all about spring forces and
18:39 - all different kinds of springs and
18:40 - making particles and connecting them by
18:42 - Springs so in a lot of scenarios if you
18:44 - want to have a system of many connected
18:46 - Springs to simulate like a chain I'm
18:52 - sorry a blank and you could do you can
18:54 - do lots of great situations with Springs
18:57 - in many cases you're gonna want to use
18:59 - one of the library so I would say play
19:00 - with this for now when we come back to
19:03 - top one we get to toxic libs we might
19:04 - revisit this and kind of look
19:06 - compare/contrast
19:07 - does it make sense to kind of calculate
19:08 - the spring force yourself in the code or
19:10 - just use a libraries can built in spring
19:13 - objects but if you're looking for an
19:15 - exercise here what I would suggest this
19:18 - is really a this is really a place where
19:19 - you can do kind of like what we said
19:21 - with the pendulum try to make a system
19:23 - of Springs and I'm gonna describe two
19:26 - scenarios for you one would be create a
19:31 - set of Springs like this and you're
19:33 - gonna see if if you draw it just as kind
19:35 - of like a curved path it's gonna appear
19:37 - a little bit like string perhaps and
19:40 - another thing you might try doing is
19:41 - create a grid of Springs so to create
19:44 - almost like a skeleton for some kind of
19:47 - strange I don't know what I'm doing
19:48 - structure so spring forces you you know
19:50 - you oh boy you can do so much with them
19:52 - and I'm not going to blather on because
19:54 - clearly you should
19:57 - you know cuz we're done this is like 20
19:59 - minutes already so hopefully this helped
20:02 - you I can't imagine what's still
20:06 - watching at this point but if you are
20:08 - I'm gonna press the button now to shut
20:09 - this video off and this this marks the
20:11 - end of the oscillation chapter and we're
20:13 - gonna get to looking at particle systems
20:15 - next which is systems of many many many
20:17 - moving objects okay

Cleaned transcript:

hate having to enter but anyway hi Spriggs this video is gonna be about spring forces spring forces is Boeing Boeing Boeing okay so what did we just look at little punchy we just looked at a pendulum and what we're really looking at was an idealized pendulum the arm of that pendulum we didn't really simulate the fact that it you know it couldn't bend at all contributing well the spring is a similar situation to a pendulum which we could represent as a bob hanging from perhaps some origin point but instead of hanging from this idealized rod a fixed length instead we have this elastic arm this elastic arm that in fact can be expanded and contracted and thus a force is gonna suddenly you know it's a spring to pull it in Springs I think you know what I'm talking about right so we could represent that by drawing this sort of squiggly springs thing there we go that's nice okay what a nice drawing okay so this is what we're working with a spring now that we've established that let's figure out how would we simulate this how would we get this sort of springy motion oscillating up and down so we know we can do this with with with the sine function with a sine wave we spent a whole video a couple videos back looking at that and that's what's going on right here in this processing example right if we take the result of cosine of an angle and map it to some range then and we use that for the Y value of something it's moving up and down it looks like a spring the thing about this is while we have the simulation on the screen it doesn't integrate with anything we've done before what we really want is this spring coming up and down but in addition to going up and down a wind force could blow on it gravity could happen you could bonk it to it you could connect other Springs it could be a whole set of forces all being applied to this object so we need to look at instead of just kind of using a kind of trigonometry sine cosine trick to make that oscillating motion we really need to look at modeling a spring force how do we do that let's go over here shall we okay so spring forces are modeled using something called Hookes law wrote this down over there Hookes law in Latin is I can't pronounce but maybe nobody can pronounce Latin or whatever ooh tensio sic vis translates to as the extension so the force and it would be nice if like the letters just of that appeared in front of me but that's not gonna happen right now but what we're talking about is we're saying the force of a spring is directionally directly proportional to the extension of the spring right the more we stretch that spring out the stronger that force the more we contract the spring the stronger the force a spring it at rest won't have any force and Hookes law is typically written as follows F equals negative K times X so what are these values has with just about everything we were looking at in this series of videos about something we've got a constant right K is a constant you know it probably has some realworld numbers for different kinds of Springs but for us it's just allowing us to tweak tweak the behavior of our spring is it a really elastic spring or it's a kind of a rigid spring try a higher constant try a lower constant you'll see what happens deep breath what is X X is the displacement right we talked about the force of the spring displacement well that kind of says the displacement the force of the spring being proportional to the extension of the spring X is that extension how what is the difference between the actual length of the spring and the rest length so this is something that's really important a spring has a rest length that is the length of the spring will naturally kind of gravitate towards at rest that's where it will sit without moving without springing at all as soon as we displace it from that rest position will let go it's gonna spring back and forth so this is great now one thing that you know I just noticed something about this formula so this is gonna be a vector right we're gonna we're gonna have a spring that's in a two dimensional world and so this is actually really just telling us the magnitude of the force this is how strong it is the force that the magnitude of the force it's stronger with a high constant big displacement it's weaker with a low constant and no displacement but with as with any vector and calculating any force we need both the magnitude and the direction how are we gonna get that direction let's see let's see I think it's pretty obvious right okay so let's think about this for a second let's take me let me draw this spring again let's say this is kind of representing the springs rest link that's the spring rest length but we we've stretched it out and we've pulled it down to here well what's the direction of the force clearly visually we can see the direction of the force is a vector that points back from the Bob to the origin so we're gonna be able to do this we know that if we know this as a location origin and this we're calling the Bob and maybe this Bob is going to be an object with a location we can make a vector that points from the Bob's location to the origin and then we can calculate its magnitude by saying negative the display negative some constant times that displacement how do we know that displacement well look at this this I would say is the current length current length so we have the rest length and the current length what if X equal to X is equal to current minus rest what is the difference between the current length of the spring and its rest length here we can see it's you know it's going to be some number it's longer you can see here that if we were to kind of shrink that spring like push it all the way in right this is still our rest length we push the spring all the way in that displacement it's going to be a negative number and so that's going to reverse the direction of the force so then that force would push it out so you know if you ever saw all of these simulations of stuff on the screen which is like springing bouncing all this that looks kind of cool it's all spring anything that's physics and I can't handle that look at this formula I don't think we've looked at it for a force this simple I mean we had like you know numerators and denominators and other formulas and Greek letters this is really simple I mean I suppose the Hookes law in Latin so that was a little bit hard but but here we've just got negative K times X awesome and we know about vectors I'm pretty sure we can do this okay now what I want to do is kind of start putting some code together that's gonna make that's gonna simulate the spring force and then we'll talk about a big question in it here's how do we really organize this program in an objectoriented way and i am recording this so i haven't wasted my time so far you know that last video the penciled one I didn't stop to say it was recording which was a good thing okay but and we've been going about seven minutes good okay I got to stop talking about that I'm making a video you guys know that I'm doing that okay hi here we are now we're over here so we look at this oscillating one it's very hot in here and I'm gonna close this out and let's look at this one so one thing I should notice whose is that one thing that we should notice I should notice you should notice we should all notice we should all notice is that the bob is now a mover object we didn't have that with the pendulum our pendulum example we kind of did in this simple way where we just dealt with sort of like the vector location of the bob and the vector location the origin we did some trigonometry and it moved we really want to build this in a way that other forces we could blow some wind on it and it would move so that bob is a mover it could experience gravity could experience wind of friction and he made up forces that we had but it also can be connected with a spring force a spring force is just another force we can apply to an object so somewhere at some point if we do this successfully which I'm going to try to do we're eventually just gonna say Bob that apply bob dad Bob dot apply force spring force right this is what we're looking to do we need to calculate that spring force and then apply it to our object can we do that I think we can so let's think about let's remind ourselves the magnitude of the force is negative some constant times the displacement okay so in order to do that we need to figure out what is the displacement I forget it let's figure out the direction of the force first we'll get to the magnitude a second let's look at the direction of the force a forces points from the bob to the origin so origin is a vector that's its location Bob is a mover and the Bob's location is ah scroll up edit edit this out of this out the table location is a vector inside of the mover class so we can make a vector I'm just going to call it direction which equals I'm gonna subtract the Bob's location the origin okay now we've got that direction vector the Bob's location the origin hey you know what we need to know we need to know the current length of the spring because we're gonna compare that to the rest length by the way the rest length is just a nice little variable that's set up to be 200 so that's fixed here this spring has a rest length of 200 we need to know the current length well just so happens we just made a vector that points from the origin to the Bob you know what the current length of that spring is it's the length of that vector so I'm gonna make a variable called current length and just say really quickly let me ask for the magnitude of that vector so I have the current length cuz I'm gonna need that once we've done that I can normalize that vector now that we've normalized that vector it's of length 1 and I can scale it appropriately later ok what do we need we need a constant K I got one I got one for a really good constant oh it was gonna be a good one one point one that's not a good one the selim constant oh well you think of something better okay that's a constant point one I don't know that sounds good maybe we're gonna need to make it smaller maybe we're going to need to make it bigger we'll do something okay that's the constant now now that now we need X the magnitude is negative K times X X is the displacement I'm gonna call it in this example stretch I don't want to ding ding there's a bell ringing which you probably can't hear but it's distracting okay I'm gonna call it stretch the reason why I'm not gonna call it X is because we kind of used the variable X to mean a lot of other things and I don't want to use X to be displacement so I could call a displacement but I'm gonna call it stretch that equals current length minus rest length awesome so we've got the constant K we've got the displacement now we need to do is say all right multiply that force that direction vector by negative K times Treach that's what Hookes law says and then didn't we down here say what are we going to do we're gonna apply that force now we call the dir for direction but then we manipulated it maybe it would have made more sense to call it spring the whole way through and I'm just gonna if I had planned this out better I would have just done that now we've got this variable called spring we did all the calculations and now we're gonna apply that force and we're gonna run it now oh let's ask ourselves a question that's let's just run it nothing's moving why isn't it moving it we want it to move why isn't it moving well here's the thing the rest length is 200 and the Bob's location is that width divided by 2 comma 200 the current displacement is 0 we actually position the Bob at the wrestling so now we can see if this works by just let's just put it a little further down 40 pixels down and we see oh it's bringing back and forth right okay whew it's probably better if we did it wrong we had to fix something but you could see it's working now there's some things about this maybe that looks a little too elastic so what can I do I'm want to maybe I want to maybe I want to I'm sorry maybe I want to make it a little a little less I don't really need to do that you can see it's a little less so manipulating K will do quite a few things but perhaps I just want to demonstrate that we could add other forces to this scenario for example and this is going to be kind of dangerous to do this I could make up a force called wind which is just going to be some arbitrary value that I seem to use and if the mouse is pressed let's apply that force just to prove that what we've done is actually created a spring force within a world that can have lots of other forces when I click the mouse you see some wind now oh we lost it now ah maybe we should add it's kind of like going crazy maybe we should actually add a little bit of gravity I didn't really need to do this but I'm sort of demonstrating a point that this spring force is just yet another force and we can see now if I had a little wind it blows but if I let go gravity's gonna pull it back down now there's no dampening of this spring so maybe we want to add some friction so air resistance just sort of dampen the velocity there's lots of things we can do here but look at this this is pretty great we've actually gotten the spring force going okay good job well that's I think this is close to the end here but I kind of want to ask if you have any questions but okay so here's the thing we need to reorganize this code this is a mess uhhuh this makes me very uncomfortable and I I don't like it at all look at all the wood be suspicious of all of this code here doing all these calculations I think it probably makes sense for us to actually have a spring class so I just want to discuss that for a moment okay here I am right okay so we have this spring system I'm erasing everything which has a couple things there is an origin point which I actually might want to call the anchor we can think of that as what the spring is anchored to the spring also has a variable which is the rest length which is very important it's obviously quite crucial in our calculations there is also this Bob but we've already established that the Bob is a mover the Bob is what it's going to have location velocity acceleration we're going to be able to apply forces to it this is something we already have it's the mover so would should we add a function inside the mover which is like a spring function we could we could do what we did over here we should just have a lot of gobbledygook code and draw and then apply a force to the Bob but I think a better solution would be to actually create a spring class and then what would the variables of that spring class be one variable could be the location of the anchor another variable could be the rest length oh my goodness and I forgot something important another variable could be the spring constant k how elastic is the spring how weak is this spring so what we've done is we've said all of the stuff that has to do with the spring that stuff in the spring class all the stuff that has to do with the Bob that's our Bob class are what we've called mover in all of our previous examples we could call this one a shaker now but that's kind of this weird inside joke that makes no sense to anybody right now except for me or a couple of people watching this video okay so what's missing though we need a way of applying the spring of the spring force to the mover object and one suggestion I would have for that is we could add a function in the spring class called connect which connects the spring to a given mover this is going to be incredibly powerful because what it would allow us to do is it allows it to have a system of many Springs of many objects and we could connect this object to this spring and this object to this spring we could make the anchor of one you know this is the opens another question maybe the anchor should actually be another actually moving object we could have a spring without about having a fixed anchor point so there's lots of ways opens up kind of a can of worms of possibilities but what this allows us to do and I think I'll just show this to you in code over here there is a example that I'm hoping is prepared right here in the draw function and there's a lot of some extra stuff this is the line of code this is now example 3.11 if you're falling on one go look in the github repo you can see here we can say spring dot Connect Bob this is now a system where we have a bob object and a spring object we make this spring with a location and a rest length and we make the bob and then at any point we can say spring dot connect Bob so that's the function that handled okay where's the Bob where's the spring what's the current length compare that to the rest length calculate that force apply it to the Bob that all happens inside that function and if we wanted to we could just take a quick look at that we can see this right here this is the exact same algorithm that we typed out ourselves the force is the difference between the Bob's location and the anchor we need to get the stretch which is the displacement that we need to scale that force and apply it to about all of that happens in that function so I don't know I am a little bit obsessed with kind of nice clean objectoriented design but I think this is this is a really flexible scenario a couple things I should mention about this one thing about this spring is you can see this example if you go look at it it constrains the spring so it can never go below a minimum length or a maximum length I mean that's sort of an artificial constraint but it can make the system behave a little nicely a little more nicely and it also has some dampening in it and it also lets the user kind of drag this around so now that we've looked through this scenario I should really say here's the thing so the next set of videos are gonna be about particle systems and then we're gonna start looking at physics libraries you know a spring force is something that other people have thought of and in fact one of the libraries we're gonna look at toxic libs verlet physics package is all about spring forces and all different kinds of springs and making particles and connecting them by Springs so in a lot of scenarios if you want to have a system of many connected Springs to simulate like a chain I'm sorry a blank and you could do you can do lots of great situations with Springs in many cases you're gonna want to use one of the library so I would say play with this for now when we come back to top one we get to toxic libs we might revisit this and kind of look compare/contrast does it make sense to kind of calculate the spring force yourself in the code or just use a libraries can built in spring objects but if you're looking for an exercise here what I would suggest this is really a this is really a place where you can do kind of like what we said with the pendulum try to make a system of Springs and I'm gonna describe two scenarios for you one would be create a set of Springs like this and you're gonna see if if you draw it just as kind of like a curved path it's gonna appear a little bit like string perhaps and another thing you might try doing is create a grid of Springs so to create almost like a skeleton for some kind of strange I don't know what I'm doing structure so spring forces you you know you oh boy you can do so much with them and I'm not going to blather on because clearly you should you know cuz we're done this is like 20 minutes already so hopefully this helped you I can't imagine what's still watching at this point but if you are I'm gonna press the button now to shut this video off and this this marks the end of the oscillation chapter and we're gonna get to looking at particle systems next which is systems of many many many moving objects okay
