00:00 - hello good afternoon welcome to part two
00:02 - of happy pi day on the coding train
00:07 - which is me again Daniel Shipman I am
00:11 - wondering if the music is sounds ok
00:15 - efforts all glitchy like it was this
00:17 - morning this morning I did two coding
00:19 - challenges themed round PI one coding
00:23 - challenge involved I don't see anyone
00:26 - saying anything in the chat it's always
00:27 - oh hi again great one coding challenge
00:30 - involved estimating or approximating the
00:33 - value of Pi using the a ratio of the
00:36 - area of a square to a circle so I did
00:40 - that
00:41 - complete head to snaps in a circle
00:45 - I also did a coding challenge where I
00:48 - sort of visualize the digits of pi very
00:51 - poorly I almost feel like that should
00:53 - just get thrown away but hopefully
00:56 - that'll be useful I'm gonna do another
00:57 - coding challenge right now where I
00:59 - visualize the digits of pi and but I'm
01:06 - going to do it in a book the goal is to
01:10 - make a book and I'm gonna start with a
01:11 - grid I tried this this morning and I got
01:13 - all turned around in my head so I had a
01:16 - moment I had a little sandwich I made
01:18 - myself some coffee I'm back so hopefully
01:20 - my voice feels a little scratchy so but
01:23 - hopefully I will make it through and
01:27 - what I'm going to attempt to do is
01:31 - design a book or a pink about as a
01:36 - poster first or even just a processing
01:38 - window where F which is a grid of tiles
01:42 - and every tile could display a
01:44 - particular digit of pi or a visual
01:47 - representation of that digit and one
01:49 - idea that I think came in through one of
01:51 - the github suggestions was to represent
01:57 - each digit as a polygon so 0 would be
02:00 - nothing 1 would be a point 2 would be a
02:02 - line 3 would be a triangle forward be a
02:04 - square 5 would be a Pentagon 6 would be
02:06 - a hexagon that sort of thing see I
02:07 - remember where all these things are
02:08 - septagon octagon 9 to takata 9 at 909
02:14 - toccata Kentico to go to a dig on and
02:17 - then dodecahedron right there was at ten
02:19 - oh boy I was doing so well Tyler Davis
02:30 - asks if I will do a back flip and I will
02:34 - not know no amount I mean I will I try
02:38 - but I first of all I already have all
02:42 - sorts of issues going and I know I could
02:46 - not do a back flip alright nonagon dov'Ã¨
02:49 - gone ok nonagon thank you
02:52 - alright so me and cat took Tong alright
02:56 - so look here's a bunch of digits of pi
02:58 - so I'm just gonna jump right in because
03:02 - I let me close this let me close this
03:10 - what do I got going on here that that
03:12 - doesn't need to be open processing needs
03:14 - to be open
03:25 - so let's see here let's include the
03:38 - let's keep that string of Pi by saying
03:41 - load strings PI 1 million txt index 0
03:49 - and then 3 point in front of it okay so
03:54 - this should if I'm right let's get rid
03:57 - of this let's get rid of that nightmare
04:01 - this should I'm gonna get rid of the 10
04:03 - million this is the 1 million ok and so
04:09 - and let's just make sure this works by
04:13 - chucking there we go great 1 million and
04:21 - 3 why is it 1 million in 3 shouldn't it
04:26 - just be 1 million in - did I do
04:32 - something of that file 1 million in 1 I
04:35 - think I did something that file by
04:36 - accident probably like because I opened
04:40 - it in TextEdit I probably added like a
04:42 - space or something though I added a line
04:47 - break save glad I noticed that nope why
04:57 - is it still a thousand and one
04:58 - characters that makes me sad oh look I
05:03 - added something there and I by accident
05:05 - - ok there we go ok I'm glad I noticed
05:10 - that boy would not like to have the
05:12 - first digit of pi be something weird
05:19 - yeah load string splits yeah ok letter I
05:25 - at the start thank you Jacob in the chat
05:28 - all right stretch everybody stretch
05:31 - before you start dealing with digits of
05:33 - pi
05:37 - elbow doesn't Bend all the way straight
05:39 - on the right side but it's okay I'm
05:41 - doing fine all right are you ready
05:52 - because I was born not ready at all I
05:57 - was definitely I've never been ready for
05:59 - anything mostly I'm just very not ready
06:01 - but let's go oh
06:04 - Tushar remembers 3.14159265 35 feet 979
06:11 - that's way more than I could possibly
06:12 - remember hello and welcome to yet
06:19 - another Pi Day 2018 themed coding
06:23 - challenge in this coding challenge I'm
06:25 - going to attempt to make something that
06:27 - I am calling the book of Pi something
06:29 - exists like that already I want to make
06:31 - a book in the form of a PDF file that
06:35 - has maybe 1 million digits of pi
06:38 - visualized in some way you could flip
06:40 - through it and read it because well one
06:42 - thing I would actually have the digit
06:54 - make up high out of Pi so I have an
07:00 - issue which is that I have too much
07:02 - cable here
07:10 - we're gonna start over and we will have
07:16 - this book at the ready
07:29 - Joel in the chat rightz my love for pi
07:32 - is highly irrational but love it alright
07:37 - hello welcome to another pi day
07:40 - 2018 themed coding challenge and in this
07:43 - coding challenge I'm gonna try to make
07:46 - something which I am calling the book of
07:48 - pi now I really like kind of a strange
07:51 - person that you you've already well
07:53 - aware of this I really like books that
07:54 - are just full of numbers I'd like to
07:57 - read them quietly to my children at
07:59 - night time for bedtime 69 thousand one
08:02 - hundred and three fifty six thousand
08:04 - five hundred sixty these are some random
08:06 - numbers from the book of a million
08:07 - random digits now I would love to say
08:09 - more about this book I'll include a link
08:11 - to more information about this book in
08:13 - this video's description but what I
08:14 - would love to have in my hands is a book
08:17 - with a million digits of pi maybe ten
08:20 - million digits maybe a hundred million
08:22 - I don't know as many digits I could fit
08:23 - into a book so then from there perhaps
08:27 - even it would be you might think about
08:29 - making a giant poster that has every
08:31 - digit and then visualizing each digit at
08:32 - something like a color or a shape or
08:34 - creating your own piece of art from the
08:36 - digits of pi so I want this video to be
08:39 - a place a video that you can watch to
08:41 - get you started on this so what I'm
08:44 - gonna do to figure this out is I'm gonna
08:46 - first of all I'm gonna use processing
08:47 - which is a Java based programming
08:48 - environment from the processing
08:49 - foundation much more information about
08:51 - that below in the video description as
08:53 - well and I already have in the in this
08:56 - the data folder a text file with 1
08:59 - million digits of pi I will include when
09:02 - I publish the code for this I will also
09:05 - include a link to ten million digits and
09:07 - 1 billion digits and you can find more
09:10 - as well so but I'm actually going to
09:12 - comment this out because what I want to
09:15 - do first is I just want to have a system
09:18 - by which I can render a grid because
09:21 - ultimately I'm going to have a grid of
09:23 - all the digits on each page and I want
09:26 - to render each digit individually right
09:28 - one thing I could do is just take that
09:30 - text file and do print so depite export
09:33 - to PDF that I want to be able to render
09:35 - all the stuff in an artistic way so I
09:37 - mean I'm not good at artistic way
09:39 - I want to show you how to do it
09:41 - so you the person watching with artistic
09:43 - talent can make something or just if you
09:45 - had some creative experimental idea
09:47 - don't feel any pressure to make anything
09:48 - quote-unquote artistic artistic with a
09:50 - lowercase a alright so let's start by
09:53 - I'm gonna create a nested loop with Y on
09:57 - the outside and this is I'm gonna do
10:00 - this in a sort of weird way I'm gonna
10:03 - say W equals I'm gonna just arbitrarily
10:05 - pick some numbers and I'm gonna so I'm
10:08 - gonna have a width and a height and have
10:10 - them both be 12 through the matters I
10:13 - tried to do this earlier today and I
10:15 - kind of mucked it up so I'm sort of
10:19 - thought about it a bit more which
10:20 - doesn't mean that I'll anything will be
10:22 - close to correct but I now have a nested
10:24 - loop and what I want to do in this
10:27 - nested loop is I want to draw a
10:28 - rectangle at every x and y that is the
10:31 - size of width and height and I want to
10:33 - give it a random color so let's just
10:37 - start like this the reason why I want to
10:39 - do this I want to see okay I can draw a
10:41 - grid of random colors now what I want to
10:44 - do just to get started is let me
10:47 - represent each digit of pi with a
10:49 - grayscale value so 0 only black be black
10:52 - 9 will be white and every other digit
10:54 - will be some color in between so how can
10:57 - I do that now what I can do is I can
10:58 - load my digits of pi file I this this is
11:03 - actually in there because the the file
11:04 - doesn't have it just starts with 1 4 1 5
11:07 - 9 actually don't want to include the 3
11:09 - point but maybe if I make it a text
11:12 - version of it I will want that later so
11:13 - let me take that out so what I'm gonna
11:16 - do is I'm gonna create a variable called
11:17 - index and all the way through the loop
11:20 - I'm gonna separately increment that
11:22 - index and I am going to get string digit
11:28 - equals PI car at index and maybe I want
11:34 - to turn that into a number right now so
11:37 - why is this oh it would want to be a
11:40 - character mm-hmm let's will that know oh
11:44 - boy oh boy
11:45 - ah let's convert that to a string this
11:48 - is the awkward whose is awkward I don't
11:49 - know what I'm doing then somebody in the
11:52 - chat would tell me a better way but
11:53 - let's call this s
11:54 - and then I'm gonna say it digit equals
11:56 - I'll just convert that quickly from a
11:58 - string to a digit so I could have made
12:01 - it anyway so let's let's start with that
12:02 - and then what I'm going to do is I'm
12:04 - going to create a color I'll call it
12:07 - bright for brightness which I'm going to
12:09 - map that digit which goes from 0 to 10
12:11 - to between 0 and 255 um
12:17 - so 9 should really be so I think what
12:20 - I'm gonna do just I'm gonna make this
12:22 - 256 and make this 9 no no 255 sorry 0
12:29 - through 9 will that work
12:30 - I'm so confused already and this should
12:32 - be a float and actually yeah all right
12:40 - so let's let's do this okay here we go
12:42 - let's see what happens these are I think
12:46 - the digits of pi mapped to a grayscale
12:49 - value so the 9 are we seeing 9s are we
12:52 - seeing white the color white this could
12:54 - be a nine so what I would actually like
12:55 - to do now is write the digit in there so
12:58 - I could kind of debug this and see if
13:00 - it's working correctly so what I also
13:02 - then want to do is say text the digit oh
13:07 - I have a random in there oh the random
13:10 - thank you thank you to the chat this
13:13 - random should not be in there I thought
13:15 - that looked a little weird there we go
13:18 - so this looks better now 3.1415926 this
13:28 - seems right so so maybe I won't write
13:31 - the numbers right let's write the
13:32 - numbers in there just to be sure because
13:34 - I want to be able to write the numbers
13:35 - eventually so I'm also gonna say text
13:38 - the digit I mean I could use the digit
13:43 - at that X&Y and I'm gonna say fill 255
13:47 - minus bright I'm just gonna invert the
13:49 - color and let's just see what happens
13:51 - there you can sort of see there are some
13:53 - numbers but they don't match up right so
13:55 - one issue is that when I draw a digit at
13:59 - this location right that top left it's
14:01 - actually appearing above so this is the
14:03 - wrong digit I want the digit to appear
14:06 - at the bottom so it should be y + H
14:08 - and I also want to say text-align:center
14:14 - which should give me the okay that
14:17 - didn't work right
14:18 - because oh because so I'm going to say
14:21 - this I could probably I'm gonna say X +
14:24 - w / - let's do that let's run this again
14:30 - does that I missed it okay see you again
14:33 - now now this looks right right one four
14:36 - one five nine two six five so we can see
14:39 - that it is mapping to the correct colors
14:41 - wonderful okay we're getting somewhere
14:44 - now these don't really look like squares
14:47 - to me weirdly did I say width and height
14:49 - width height height width twelve twelve
14:55 - I don't know maybe that's an optical
14:56 - illusion and I'm being told in the chat
15:01 - that I should try Center Center can
15:04 - ivory a-line Center as well yep and then
15:08 - I could say height y plus height divided
15:12 - by two and now the digits are perfectly
15:15 - in theory perfectly aligned in the
15:17 - center of these what I believe to be
15:20 - squares you know what it is it's an
15:21 - optical illusion the fact that the
15:23 - characters are kind of elongated I think
15:25 - is tricking me into thinking those are
15:27 - taller than they are why okay so now we
15:31 - see that so here's the thing I want to
15:33 - turn this into a book or I at the very
15:39 - least want to render a huge version of
15:42 - it so the way that I want to do this is
15:45 - with the PDF renderer in processing so
15:48 - I'm going to go to the web and I'm gonna
15:50 - go to processing website reference
15:52 - actually libraries PDF export so one of
15:57 - the things processing has this size
16:00 - function where you typically will set
16:02 - the width and height of the window you
16:04 - can also set the renderer a renderer
16:06 - might be P 3d for 3d graphics but a
16:09 - renderer can also be PDF and when it
16:11 - renders to PDF it's not rendering the
16:13 - pixels of what you seeing it's actually
16:15 - drawing the vector based lines and
16:18 - shapes of what you're drawing so that
16:20 - this is now some
16:21 - you could blow up to be super
16:22 - high-resolution or important to some
16:24 - other kind of program that works
16:25 - natively with vector files so so but
16:29 - actually instead I want to be able to
16:30 - still see what I'm doing on the screen
16:32 - so I'm going to go and get the look at
16:36 - this example with a screen display and I
16:39 - can actually just use size as normal but
16:41 - call begin record so I'm gonna say oops
16:44 - ah actually I don't
16:46 - okay I don't need to copy-paste this I'm
16:47 - gonna say right here begin record book
16:52 - of Pi dot PDF I think that's all I have
16:55 - to say no oh PDF write PDF yes because
17:03 - begin record could also I think render
17:05 - out like a 3d model I think it's another
17:07 - version of and then I at the end I want
17:09 - to say and record so let's run this
17:13 - again oops oh I forgot I have to import
17:18 - the library so for to be able to do it I
17:20 - have to import processing PDF dot star
17:22 - this is Java syntax for importing a
17:24 - separate Java library so we see this
17:28 - here and now if I go to the sketch
17:29 - folder there's a PDF called book of Pi
17:32 - and I can blow that up and run around
17:35 - look at that so you can see here so even
17:38 - though it's zooming in I want to zoom in
17:39 - this way so you can really see right no
17:41 - matter how far i zoom in I don't lose
17:44 - any quality because this is actually
17:46 - drawing the vector path to this PDF now
17:50 - one thing we should look at is the size
17:51 - of the PDF this isn't so bad 163
17:53 - kilobytes we're in good shape here one
17:56 - thing that I think that I want to do is
17:58 - let's change the well actually let me
18:01 - take out drawing the text I'm going to
18:03 - cook I'll come back to that now I just
18:07 - want to see how big can I make this so
18:11 - if I make this so what would be now
18:14 - let's say I want to fit all million
18:15 - digits into one page so let me keep it
18:19 - at 400 400 mmm let me think about this
18:21 - let me actually make this 800 by 800
18:23 - just to start with something larger a
18:25 - million the square root of 1 million is
18:28 - what 1 thousands so if I want to have a
18:32 - thousand columns
18:34 - and a thousand rows let's start with
18:36 - something smaller let's start with a
18:38 - hundred columns and a hundred rows then
18:42 - the width should be the width divided by
18:46 - the number of columns the height should
18:48 - be the height divided by the number of
18:52 - rows right so this should be a that and
18:57 - then if I do print line I'm just curious
18:58 - index this should have gotten to 10,000
19:01 - right this should show 10,000 rectangles
19:05 - there you go so that's 10,000 rectangles
19:07 - and that is now also in this PDF which
19:13 - is still right there so I can zoom all
19:15 - the way in and we can see I can zoom all
19:17 - the way out can I do view
19:20 - I just wanted to zoom to fit I guess
19:23 - it's already done that okay so we can
19:25 - see there it is okay now let's see if we
19:27 - can get all 1 million digits of pi so
19:34 - let's change this to one thousand one
19:38 - thousand in theory I shouldn't worry
19:40 - about the size of the window it's sort
19:41 - of irrelevant at this point although
19:43 - there's an issue with the numbers
19:44 - getting so so small that that might make
19:46 - the PDF rendering kind of wonky let's
19:49 - see what happens so this is gonna take a
19:52 - long time hold on take a break go get a
19:55 - cup of tea I'll be back
20:04 - I'm checking my email
20:11 - no stroke I should do 1000 by 1000 oh
20:16 - yeah this is gonna be a disaster
20:18 - yeah first of all I got an error out of
20:24 - range I'm back I didn't work actually
20:37 - got an error string index out of range 1
20:40 - million so the index should never have
20:42 - gone to 1 million but I think I probably
20:45 - have a little bit of a rounding error so
20:49 - I'm just gonna right now I'm just gonna
20:51 - like not worry too much about that and
20:54 - say if index index is greater than s dot
20:58 - length then greater than or equal to X
21:05 - dot length index should equal s dot
21:09 - length minus 1 so this will at least get
21:11 - rid of that error but I just realized
21:12 - something if this is 800 by 800 and I'm
21:15 - playing to have a thousand by a thousand
21:17 - that's definitely not going to work I
21:19 - don't even have that many pixels so I
21:21 - possibly draw that many rectangles so
21:23 - let's try doing the size now this is why
21:26 - I kind of probably want to not bother to
21:28 - render a preview and I actually have a
21:30 - whoops
21:40 - sorry if this popped up this is why I
21:46 - might not want to bother to render the
21:48 - preview the preview is gonna be
21:49 - irrelevant but I'm sort of wondering if
21:51 - it kind of will make do once it goes to
21:53 - the PDF because this the actual pixel
21:55 - dimensions are irrelevant so I'm just
21:57 - curious I'm gonna let it go again and
21:59 - see what it does it shouldn't look like
22:02 - anything in the window but maybe we'll
22:04 - see something so 13 megabytes
22:24 - [Music]
22:31 - so this is the PDF I got that didn't
22:34 - seem to work
22:35 - it's all in there though cuz it is 13
22:37 - megabytes oh well maybe it's just really
22:40 - slow to appear let's try let's try
22:43 - creating a larger window size even if
22:45 - it's larger than what I can see on the
22:47 - screen so what I want to do is actually
22:49 - I'm gonna say no stroke ooh
22:54 - this was for the text I'm gonna say no
22:56 - stroke to get rid of the outline of the
22:59 - rectangle and then also I am going to
23:02 - make this the size of four thousand by
23:05 - four thousand which should at least give
23:08 - me a 4x4 or 2x2 rectangle let's see if
23:11 - that what that does so it's much bigger
23:16 - than what I can display on my screen so
23:25 - I see all I still
23:29 - [Music]
23:35 - I'm a little concerned of my computer's
23:38 - ability to display the PDF some things
23:47 - there hmm that doesn't look right either
23:59 - this is the penis something in that PDF
24:00 - for sure let me go back and look here
24:05 - did I make some weird mistake
24:22 - mmm yeah I definitely want to use color
24:24 - mode HSB that's the next thing I'm gonna
24:26 - do
24:29 - to what extent oh yeah I have a new idea
24:36 - one is I'm gonna get rid of the PDF
24:38 - rendering and what I'm actually going to
24:41 - do is I am going to use create graphics
24:47 - so I'm gonna create an off-screen
24:48 - graphics context that's much bigger than
24:50 - the window and I'm gonna say P graphics
24:56 - and I'm gonna call this a canvas and I'm
24:59 - gonna say canvas equals create graphics
25:05 - that's I'm gonna make this quite big
25:08 - 16,000 by 16,000 gonna make a huge
25:12 - graphics window
25:13 - I think processing should be able to do
25:15 - that and then I'm just gonna have the
25:17 - actual size of the window be 800 by 800
25:20 - and I still want to have columns and
25:22 - rows and now I want to say everything
25:24 - should be done as part of the canvas so
25:28 - instead of rendering to the window and
25:32 - though so now I want to say canvas fill
25:35 - canvas dot stroke canvas rectangle and
25:37 - then I am going to
25:49 - oh I just noticed something I just
25:52 - noticed something that I forgot about
25:54 - this is integer arithmetic so that's
25:57 - gonna really mess stuff up especially
26:00 - when I had only 800 pixels that's why I
26:02 - didn't see anything so let me make these
26:05 - just to let me make these floats because
26:09 - an integer divided by an integer will
26:11 - always be an integer oh no these were
26:13 - floats though never mind
26:15 - since column and rows were floats I'm
26:16 - wrong about that that actually doesn't
26:18 - matter here okay but it's weird that
26:21 - it's printing out the index still a zero
26:23 - oh because because when it gets to the
26:25 - end it shouldn't be zero but let's keep
26:27 - going with this canvas fill no stroke
26:30 - rectangle so now I need to say instead
26:32 - of begin record and say canvas dot begin
26:36 - draw and at the end
26:40 - so this off-screen canvas I could say
26:43 - end draw you can draw to it just like
26:45 - the window and then I can actually just
26:48 - draw the window right there
26:49 - draw the canvas right into the window so
26:52 - let's not go crazy let's make the
26:53 - off-screen canvas 800 by 800 and let's
26:56 - just have 40 rows and 40 columns okay
27:01 - there's some other weird mistake in my
27:03 - code s dot length two pi dot length oh
27:09 - look at this what a disaster I wasn't
27:13 - looking at pi anymore
27:17 - this whole time this whole time this
27:21 - whole time oh there we go
27:29 - hey look it's working now so let me just
27:32 - keep going with this method and I'll
27:34 - come back to the PDF this was good to
27:35 - look at anyway so now let me make the
27:38 - size actually 8,000 by 8,000 let me just
27:44 - do 200 by 200 what whoops no the size
27:47 - should be 800 and let me have this be
27:49 - 8,000 by 8,000 and let's see what
27:52 - happens here whoa something went wrong
27:56 - canvas dot with canvas dot height rows
28:01 - columns canvas dot oh I need to say I
28:06 - need to shrink it down now if they're
28:08 - not the same size so this is the giant
28:11 - thing now but if I were to say canvas
28:15 - dot save you know PI Post this is the
28:18 - poster of Pi and I say PNG poster of Pi
28:25 - dot PNG that's not right oh semicolon
28:28 - I'm gonna run this come on you can do it
28:34 - you can save it there we go all right so
28:39 - now it rendered it I see my preview here
28:42 - and if I go here we have PI poster which
28:45 - is a two megabyte file I can take a look
28:47 - at that and we can see this is what it
28:50 - actually is zoomed in so now can I fit
28:55 - all 1 million digits let's make that
28:59 - happen so now I'm gonna have a thousand
29:02 - by a thousand I'm gonna make it sixteen
29:06 - thousand by sixteen thousand so each
29:08 - each rectangle will be sixteen pixels by
29:11 - 16 pixels I think that's about right who
29:14 - knows who knows my math is off this is
29:16 - gonna take a while to render let's hit
29:18 - save bo go make yourself a cup of tea
29:21 - and I'll be back when it renders or what
29:24 - it says right here out of memory okay
29:27 - wait
29:31 - and we already got the out of memory
29:34 - error so one thing is I could go back to
29:36 - my nice PDF world which I wouldn't have
29:38 - this issue necessarily and but I can
29:42 - actually do better than that let's take
29:43 - a look at the processing preferences and
29:45 - go to here oh I've already given it four
29:53 - gigabytes of memory so I've already done
29:55 - this all right let's try making this
29:58 - smaller let's do let's do let's try
30:03 - 4,000 by 4,000 that should be fine all
30:08 - right
30:09 - see you in a bit oh there it is so 4,000
30:17 - by 4,000 you can see here this is all
30:19 - that it's all one million digits of pi
30:22 - all in one window and if I go now to
30:29 - here poster of Pi a 1.2 megabyte file I
30:32 - open it up and look at this this is it
30:36 - this is it everybody this is now a a
30:43 - 4,000 by 4,000 RGB image with all the
30:47 - digits of pi okay we're getting
30:48 - somewhere
30:49 - we definitely should use HSB mode
30:52 - that'll be much more fun let's push it
30:54 - let's push it a little let's make it
30:58 - 8,000 by 8,000 to see if we can make
31:00 - that happen and let's change this to
31:03 - let's say I think I have to say canvas
31:06 - color mode canvas color mode HSB and
31:14 - let's just say one point oh let's have
31:17 - everything beef between zero and one and
31:19 - so now I should be able to say map this
31:25 - would be now be the hue and I should be
31:29 - able say hue 1 1 and this should go
31:31 - between 0 and 1 and actually be much
31:33 - easier just to say digit divided by 10 R
31:35 - divided by 9
31:36 - right because I want to get to one point
31:38 - oh I think yeah all right so let's see
31:41 - what happens here
31:57 - that didn't work that's what I got that
32:04 - doesn't look right
32:06 - fill canvas colormode HSB one fill maybe
32:13 - is color mode not let's let's make this
32:17 - small just so we can figure this out
32:23 - let's make this small again whoa what
32:26 - happened here oh so let me let me indeed
32:30 - run this we see nothing let me try color
32:33 - mode oh did I say 250 no cuz I I made
32:40 - the this should know let's go back to
32:50 - what I'm used to
32:52 - oh I know if the problem was floating
33:02 - point math always gets me every time
33:05 - it's like the Vista of Java yeah so I
33:11 - think I was right all along
33:12 - I'm gonna have some level of confidence
33:15 - here loose a lot of blue oh right
33:23 - color mode back to I think
33:36 - No
33:46 - wait a sec here what have I got going on
33:51 - here Phil I just wanna tell you ten by
33:57 - ten it's just
34:11 - nice stroke mmm the brightness is one
34:21 - isn't it oh the brightness is one like
34:25 - these should be less like somewhere in
34:26 - the the middle like no cuz it'll be
34:29 - white no no oh it'd just be well yeah
34:39 - but so one thing I just want to know is
34:44 - let's leave it default there we go
34:55 - but it's not HSB because it doesn't
35:00 - actually take it from canvas dot really
35:03 - oh no no how come I'm not getting just
35:14 - HSB mode not work in this HSB mode not
35:23 - work in create graphics kind of want to
35:33 - take out the canvas dot let me just do
35:35 - that real quick
35:44 - took out all the canvas drawing
35:52 - oh yeah so for whatever reason I'm not
35:55 - able to get HSB mo to work oh I had it
36:01 - after begin before begin draw ah maybe
36:04 - that's the issue let's see was that the
36:08 - issue did I have it there
36:19 - there we go so let me let me back up
36:25 - here
36:35 - yeah
36:40 - okay this was the problem spent a lot of
36:43 - time debugging that you could check the
36:45 - live stream if you want to see it a
36:47 - little 10 minutes of me searching for
36:48 - this but I called color mode before I
36:52 - said big begin draw which is really a
36:54 - problem that's a very bad thing that's
36:56 - not going to work so I need color mode
36:58 - to happen after and in this case now I
37:01 - can I can set the hue I could set the
37:06 - hue I could I could I mean I should be
37:08 - able to now put it back to 1:1 if I want
37:11 - to use color mode HSB with a range of 1
37:13 - from 0 to 1 and I should see there we go
37:16 - so now I see these are some digits of pi
37:18 - with a different hue saturation and
37:21 - brightness and maybe just for our eyes
37:27 - let's make the this seems kind of maybe
37:33 - do I want the brightness higher but the
37:35 - hue the saturation I don't know what I'm
37:37 - doing oh I think I just want it not as
37:39 - bright but I want it like I want it
37:41 - fully saturated yeah whatever you can
37:45 - your problem
37:46 - this is the problem I have a problem
37:50 - what my kids used to say so the problem
37:56 - is I'm terrible at design so but we're
37:58 - good it's where it's functional and you
38:01 - are better at making something beautiful
38:02 - than I am okay so let me go back now and
38:05 - say 1000 columns 1000 rows eight
38:11 - thousand pixels eight thousand pixels
38:14 - and here we go
38:25 - cut cut cut
38:36 - fulbright and zero such what I want full
38:39 - brightness and saturation I don't know
38:41 - it looked so weird
38:42 - let's go back to full brightness and
38:44 - saturation and now yeah
38:59 - I'm going I'm running it again with full
39:02 - brightness and saturation just to like
39:04 - leave it in the sort of default state
39:07 - here we go oh and I want this to be nine
39:09 - all right here we go ready I'll be back
39:12 - in a minute once it renders
39:33 - there we go tada
39:38 - there it is 1 million digits of pi all
39:41 - mapped to a to a different hue and let's
39:44 - actually open up the let's take a look
39:46 - at the PDF um it's not a PDF sorry the
39:48 - PNG which is just a 2.6 megabyte file
39:50 - and I can zoom in on it and we can sort
39:56 - of scroll around and see these are all
39:58 - the digits of pi mapped to a given hue
40:02 - so now we're getting somewhere now
40:04 - here's the thing I wouldn't go back to
40:06 - PDF land let me see if I could render
40:09 - this to a PDF okay because I think the
40:12 - issues I was having before didn't have
40:14 - to do with the PDF rendering they had to
40:16 - do with my own other kinds of mistakes
40:18 - so what do I need to do I'm gonna change
40:21 - this from and say let me think about let
40:28 - me think okay everybody stay calm I
40:34 - think what I would like to do is do the
40:37 - PDF rendering without seeing a preview
40:41 - because I think I could sort of double
40:44 - up the code and draw everything to
40:46 - canvas and the PDF but I think what I
40:48 - want to do is actually if I go back to
40:50 - the processing reference I want to do
40:52 - this single frame no no display okay
40:57 - because I'm just gonna trust in my code
41:01 - so I'm gonna get rid of I'm gonna what
41:04 - I'm actually gonna do is I'm going I'm
41:05 - gonna save a new version of this so
41:07 - that's like a version that renders a PNG
41:09 - file I'm going to say PI day five I got
41:11 - to rename all these and so I can muck
41:14 - around with this a little bit more I'm
41:15 - gonna take out the canvas I'm gonna take
41:18 - out the canvas I am going to again I'm
41:22 - gonna put this back to a hundred and a
41:23 - hundred I'm gonna say I'm gonna say a
41:26 - PDF book of PI dot PDF then I am going
41:35 - to say columns and
41:37 - that's good load the load the data up
41:40 - here then I don't need to begin record
41:43 - anymore if I'm so this is gone and now
41:46 - all of my canvas dots should be gone
41:49 - again because I should be saying just
41:52 - color mode with height hike with all
41:55 - this bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
41:57 - bla bla bla bla this is some
41:58 - ridiculousness there that I don't need I
42:00 - don't need to draw it anymore I don't
42:02 - need to save it anymore what I just need
42:04 - to do is say exit so when I use the PDF
42:08 - renderer here it will automatically
42:10 - render everything to this PDF and then
42:14 - exit the program so this shouldn't take
42:16 - very long to run let me just run it and
42:20 - I don't see anything because now I have
42:22 - to go and look at this PDF which nicely
42:24 - there's only 114 kilobytes I can open it
42:27 - up and there it is why is it not a
42:31 - square it is a square I just I just
42:34 - don't know how to use the computer I
42:36 - wanted to zoom to fit I don't know why
42:39 - it's not doing that let me just do this
42:40 - yeah okay so there you go there it is
42:42 - it's a PDF then we just can see that
42:44 - this is a vector drawing because no
42:45 - matter how far i zoom in as much as
42:47 - it'll let me I still have sort of a nice
42:49 - quality there alright now let's get a
42:52 - little more ambitious let's have it be
42:55 - 500 by 500 and let's make the size a
42:58 - thousand by a thousand and really the
43:00 - size is sort of irrelevant at this point
43:02 - so we finished there it is this is now a
43:09 - poster PDF and I can zoom all the way
43:14 - into with all the digits of pi and now
43:20 - is it gonna be okay I think it'll be
43:23 - okay why not why not 9 and 0 or both red
43:28 - that is a good point because I'm using
43:30 - hue saturation brightness hue is an ant
43:34 - is think of it as an angle on the color
43:35 - wheel 0 to 360 and 1.0 and zero would be
43:40 - the same so this should be divided by 10
43:42 - thank you for that excellent point me I
43:44 - am swimming in the chat let's run this
43:46 - again it hasn't stopped yet I should put
43:50 - so
43:51 - think like print line finished it
43:56 - finished though because I can see that
43:57 - the play button became disabled so let's
44:00 - look at this one more time it's an 11
44:03 - point 5 megabyte file now and I'm going
44:07 - to open it up and there it is
44:15 - 1 million digits of pi all with a
44:18 - different hue arbitrarily on a grid do
44:22 - you see the secret encoded magical
44:25 - messages there these are such mono it's
44:28 - it's just it's just having a lot of
44:29 - trouble rendering it but you can see
44:31 - it's slowly coming into focus all right
44:33 - now I want to do something really
44:35 - exciting because guess what I want to do
44:40 - this oh I already did all 1 million so
44:45 - what I want to do now I could do 10
44:47 - million I'm gonna open up no no no
44:50 - let me not be so ambitious let me make
44:52 - it a hundred by a hundred so if it is
44:54 - one oh that's a thousand pages so let's
44:58 - say I want to have it one thousand a
45:01 - hundred thousand per page to have it
45:04 - what's the square root of a hundred
45:05 - thousand I can get ten thousand per page
45:07 - that's what I'm doing here ten thousand
45:10 - per page that won't be that many pages
45:12 - let's do it yeah let me just easy math I
45:16 - don't care if it's a lot of pages 100 by
45:19 - 100 let's see what this looks like so we
45:24 - can see this is now 100 by 100 so that's
45:29 - one thousand ten thousand ten thousand
45:37 - that's ten thousand digits of pi
45:39 - represented as a hue okay now who okay
45:44 - this is very exciting what I'm gonna do
45:46 - now is I'm gonna say for int I equals
45:49 - zero I is less than 10 so this is total
45:52 - pages I'm gonna say page equals zero no
45:56 - no let's just use I I is less than total
45:58 - pages I plus plus so total pages equals
46:05 - pi dot length divided by columns times
46:13 - rows print line total pages right this
46:18 - is if I only have it 100 by 100 but I
46:21 - have 1 million digits than I need and
46:24 - 110 thousand this is how many pages I
46:27 - need now I can say this many total pages
46:31 - in debt and then I can I'm gonna say
46:37 - print line page I complete has one page
46:47 - I complete I'm gonna put another bracket
46:50 - here and then I'm going to say ah so now
46:53 - if I go back to here what I for multiple
46:55 - pages I need access to the PDF render
46:58 - itself which I can grab right here after
47:02 - setup and then I can say PDF dot next
47:10 - page so I'm now going to make a
47:13 - multi-page PDF with ten thousand digits
47:18 - on each page ready for this I'll be back
47:23 - when when it finishes or has an error
47:25 - I'm not sure which one oh that was kind
47:31 - of anticlimactic
47:32 - I could actually already see that I have
47:34 - an error here the variable total pages
47:36 - does not exist so I forgot to say int I
47:39 - want this to be an int okay let's try
47:42 - this again should never use the drum
47:47 - float does not match with int because
47:50 - these are columns and rows are floats
47:53 - that's insane what's wrong with you and
47:55 - then this needs to be a float
48:01 - okay this this fear flood I'm gonna just
48:04 - just just take your time these could
48:06 - probably be into boy Java you are fun
48:10 - okay wait alright I'll be back
48:12 - it's gonna render oh wait it finished 98
48:17 - 99 according to this it finished I now
48:20 - have a it's still a 10 megabyte PDF if I
48:24 - go to view thumbnails look at this page
48:29 - 1 page 2 page 3 page 4 page 5 page 6
48:33 - page 7 all the digits of pi
48:39 - alright let's just see if processing can
48:43 - do 10 million digits okay so I'm
48:46 - basically done what I would love to see
48:48 - is like I'm gonna obviously this code
48:50 - will be on github I want to make a
48:52 - version that just like actually has the
48:53 - raw digits in it what's the most kind of
48:55 - interesting or strange way we can
48:57 - represent it can you fit it all into a
48:58 - big poster can you make a book let's
49:01 - make a coding train book of Pi together
49:03 - as a community won't that would be fun
49:05 - but before I go let's just push let's
49:09 - push it a little
49:09 - Thank You Andres Calibri creator of the
49:12 - OpenGL processing library we always like
49:14 - to say that okay oh did I do I still
49:20 - have it wrong the hue no no that's fine
49:23 - okay okay so now what I want to do is
49:29 - I'm gonna change this I have a 10 but I
49:32 - don't have the 10 million file so let me
49:34 - go get that 10 million file here it is
49:37 - thank you to this CS course or something
49:41 - at Princeton that I mean Pi Day whoops
49:44 - where am i processing pi day 5 PI 10
49:51 - million save this file there
49:52 - I also by the way I have a link to a
49:55 - file with 1 billion digits so what I'm
50:00 - gonna do now let's see so I want to load
50:02 - the 10 million should we make it a 10
50:06 - page book with 1 million each page now
50:10 - let's keep it with 10,000 on each page
50:11 - it's not too many pages 10 million
50:15 - oh let me just say book of Pi 10 million
50:19 - so I don't overwrite my other file when
50:21 - this inevitably dies wait let's put
50:24 - let's put like some more is this gonna
50:26 - be a round number 10 million divided by
50:27 - 4 40000 probably not anyway let's just
50:33 - keep it to 10,000 per page that's just
50:35 - gonna be a thousand pages right yeah or
50:38 - something like that who cares
50:41 - it'll compute it for me ready let's
50:43 - watch the console here we go we just
50:48 - need to get to a thousand pages I'll be
50:50 - back when that happens
51:20 - this is way more fun than I could ever
51:23 - possibly imagine
51:26 - okay page 999 completes depleted so in
51:50 - theory okay hey fell down
51:53 - train whistle in theory this file here
51:56 - woo
51:58 - whoops this is kind of a large file it
52:03 - is 104 megabytes it is a PDF that has a
52:09 - thousand pages in it with a rectangle
52:12 - with a hue map to the digit of pi it has
52:15 - ten digits what has gone on so I have no
52:20 - I've sort of suspect that my computer
52:22 - might have a little trouble opening this
52:24 - file but let's take a deep breath and
52:27 - open it anyway let's close this one and
52:30 - let's open this actually amazingly it
52:35 - did it instantly and there we go all ten
52:40 - all thousand pages all 10,000 digits now
52:44 - I wonder if you might just double check
52:46 - this for me I'm on page 80 and if you
52:50 - could just check if this sequence is
52:51 - correct I didn't make any mistakes with
52:53 - my code that would be really nice thank
52:55 - you very much I really want to see it
52:56 - with the digits ah okay but I gotta end
53:00 - this video um I hope that you make
53:02 - something with this make a poster that
53:04 - vivid and by the way one I'm really
53:07 - limited in my thinking here right
53:09 - because I am thinking only in terms of
53:11 - this works like linear order of columns
53:15 - and rows but it's so arbitrary right the
53:17 - digits of pi are one dimension or
53:19 - perhaps they're in some
53:21 - multi-dimensional space that we can't
53:22 - even understand but the fact that I'm
53:24 - arranging them in this sequence you
53:26 - should remember is completely our
53:28 - so mutt might be another way that you
53:31 - sequence these or visualize these in a
53:34 - giant PDF whether it's a poster or a
53:36 - book or something else share with me I'm
53:39 - gonna work on my own on making maybe
53:42 - I'll make maybe I know maybe I'll just
53:44 - make another video real quick all right
53:46 - make the text version of this so I'll
53:48 - see you at perhaps if I make that video
53:49 - in that video otherwise have a wonderful
53:51 - pi day I'll see you in 2019
53:55 - [Music]
54:04 - who's on what's on page from 2001 did I
54:08 - get an extra page by accident oh yeah
54:11 - so my math is off we can see there's a
54:14 - blank page here at the end all right so
54:24 - now I'm just gonna send this to the
54:25 - printer the color printer downstairs
54:28 - nobody will mind right let's put this
54:29 - into a book so what I want to do now
54:34 - just just to satisfy my own curiosity
54:38 - just to satisfy my own curiosity let's
54:49 - call this text let's say so let's get
55:02 - rid of I just want it let me draw the
55:04 - rectangle I could leave this fill in
55:11 - here actually for the text no the stroke
55:20 - zero that would still be black and HSB I
55:23 - believe yes fill stroke zero maybe I
55:36 - should just make China it does it make
55:37 - sense to make a follow-up video oh I
55:42 - just call the next page at the end of
55:44 - the loop always that makes sense I mean
55:47 - should I make a follow-up video of doing
55:48 - the text and like I don't know what's
55:54 - what could be nice about that is I could
55:56 - actually do it with a non fixed-width
55:57 - font the way that I built this and have
56:00 - these the X sort of move according to
56:02 - the width of each character that would
56:04 - be kind of interesting let me just let
56:06 - me just try this real fast
56:15 - and let me say ya know Phil I mean this
56:19 - is crazy for me to do let me let me just
56:22 - do the let me load the 1 million so I'm
56:31 - just quickly rendering the text version
56:34 - of this oh I have to do 100 pages do I
56:39 - have a smaller file let me get a small
56:40 - let me make a smaller file well or can I
56:48 - put oh I forgot about my whole idea of
56:53 - visualizing the visualizing the polygon
56:58 - thing and I was excited by that
57:09 - I'm too lazy to like make up smaller
57:14 - five-oh so I have to wait till all nine
57:17 - ninety nine pages render like well I'll
57:19 - do it with 1 million it'll take less
57:21 - time than ten thousand see this is
57:28 - actually I'm finally actually doing
57:29 - something that makes sense I mean this
57:30 - would be I think highly problematic to
57:32 - try to do in JavaScript I would think oh
57:46 - whoa
57:54 - wait why does it have it shouldn't have
57:59 - a fill for the rectangle all right let
58:05 - me make all right I think I need to
58:15 - finish for today it's 3:30 and I could
58:21 - keep going with this forever and ever
58:23 - and ever but there is there are other
58:24 - things to do I think this is pretty good
58:27 - and I can work on the text version later
58:30 - somebody else will make one and I can
58:34 - show them next time all right anybody
58:39 - have any other questions you want to ask
58:43 - well I'll be back before 2019 I just
58:46 - meant the next pi day won't people 2019
58:48 - although pi approximation day as we know
58:51 - I'm just trying to understand why the
58:53 - rectangle oh did I not ever set up I
58:58 - never set a background it's actually
59:00 - it's not doing anything oh I just never
59:02 - set a background of 255 so it's working
59:06 - and I can actually also take out let me
59:10 - take out the rectangle hold on everybody
59:15 - I just I've been might as well do this
59:21 - right now except I won't have the code
59:25 - the code will be different than what I
59:27 - started what I show in the video all
59:34 - right hold on let's back up let's just
59:38 - do this as another video I'm seeing
59:43 - silly I can't go sleep at night if I
59:45 - don't finish this so I think this is
59:48 - back to where I was right okay
60:05 - I can't resist I'm gonna do one more
60:11 - coding challenge video first of all I
60:15 - forgot I had this idea of trying to do
60:16 - the different like polygons for each one
60:18 - of these cells I'll leave that as an
60:20 - exercise to the viewer anyway I talked
60:23 - about different things you could do but
60:24 - I just want to see I want to kind of see
60:26 - the numbers so I'm gonna try to do this
60:28 - in a just to see how that works I'm not
60:30 - gonna do I'm gonna keep everything just
60:32 - black and white just the pure text but
60:36 - I'm still gonna draw each character each
60:38 - number one character at a time because
60:41 - that would allow for a lot more
60:42 - possibilities obviously again if I just
60:44 - want to make a book of all the digits
60:45 - open up the text file print export to
60:48 - PDF etc but I'm gonna draw each digit
60:50 - one at a time so let me try to alter
60:53 - this to do that so couple things one is
60:55 - let me do save as and do pi day 6 this
60:59 - is like apparently the sixth thing I've
61:01 - made I'm going to go back to book of Pi
61:03 - I'm going to 1 million texts I'm gonna
61:06 - and then I'm gonna load the 1 million Pi
61:08 - file and I'm gonna keep it at 100 I
61:12 - should really make oh it timeout let me
61:15 - make a smaller text file and I'll be
61:17 - right back this is ridiculous because I
61:21 - got a save as pi PI file process so what
61:31 - I want to do is create a sketch really
61:36 - quick where I do what I did before and I
61:42 - say pi equals PI dot substring 0
61:48 - whatever I want 1000 and then a string
61:52 - output equal so let's let's do this
61:55 - let's do int N equals 1000 and string
62:01 - output equals new string 1 output index
62:06 - 0 equals PI saved strings PI pi - n
62:16 - oh there's no million pi dash n dot txt
62:24 - so now if I run this oh this this come
62:35 - and this should be output sorry I always
62:36 - get this wrong comment output so if I
62:40 - run this I should see now in a PI 1000
62:46 - which does that look like a thousand
62:48 - digits to you I don't know that seems
62:51 - like if it's a thousand digits right
62:52 - okay
62:53 - so I'm gonna grab this I'm gonna go and
62:58 - open my PI day five but no pi day six
63:04 - actually yeah and what I'm gonna do is
63:10 - grab quickly from pi day five or PI D PI
63:14 - pi file process the 1000 file pi day six
63:20 - okay right anybody see anything I did
63:24 - wrong
63:26 - yeah one kilobytes a thousand digits
63:29 - that's about right right yeah okay
63:31 - and then this can be 10 by 10 all right
63:40 - I'm back I I quickly made a file that
63:42 - only has a thousand digits of pi because
63:44 - it's gonna be much easier for me to test
63:47 - this stuff so let's go through this let
63:50 - me get rid of HSB mode wait did I make
63:54 - do I need to save a new version or did I
63:57 - already save a new version what was pot
63:58 - so I got four as I get I'm lost like
64:03 - what was PI day five and they're not
64:04 - even like in their own folder this is
64:06 - really ridiculous
64:07 - no no pi day five is fine okay so I
64:09 - already made a new version I'm back I
64:14 - made a smaller song
64:18 - okay I'm back I made a smaller file with
64:20 - only 1000 digits of pi I think that'll
64:22 - be easier to work with let's make it
64:24 - just ten by ten so it'll still be a ten
64:27 - page PDF I'm gonna get rid of color mode
64:29 - HS
64:30 - I don't want to deal with that I'm still
64:32 - gonna have this idea of multiple pages
64:34 - I'm still gonna and now I'm not gonna
64:36 - draw rectangles anymore what I'm going
64:39 - to do is I'm going to say so first of
64:41 - all I need to I need to add a background
64:44 - so I'm gonna make a white back I'm gonna
64:46 - happen like the background white before
64:48 - I start drawing let's go down here and
64:50 - make the background white then I'm going
64:53 - to say here I don't I'm gonna just say
64:56 - fill zero so every piece of text and
64:59 - then I'm going to draw the digit at a
65:03 - certain location I had this from an
65:04 - earlier coding challenge and I think
65:07 - that's it
65:07 - this should give me all the digits so
65:09 - this is weirdly gonna happen pretty fast
65:11 - but as we're gonna see I'm going to need
65:14 - to do some clean up clean up here so it
65:16 - did all the pages and if I go to which
65:19 - one of this which book of Pi 1000 texts
65:23 - we should see yeah there we go so we
65:25 - could see one four one five so a couple
65:27 - things one is I would like to include
65:30 - the I'm not gonna worry about the three
65:32 - point so one thing is I didn't think
65:34 - about the size of the text so the text
65:36 - size should really be related to the
65:39 - size of the cell um so I do you all
65:45 - remember if this is a time out for a
65:47 - second with an edit point do you
65:48 - remember what I said I'm gonna take a
65:50 - half an hour break and go make ourself a
65:52 - cup of coffee and have some lunch
65:54 - I took that half an hour break and it
65:56 - came upstairs I forgot to do one thing
65:58 - so I'm gonna take a five-minute break
66:00 - right now you can guess what that is
66:02 - little bathroom break here for a second
66:05 - and I'm gonna put because it's
66:07 - distracting me even though I probably be
66:09 - fine I am going to put on this dot song
66:14 - and mute my microphone and be right back
66:19 - digits of pi
66:30 - you
67:51 - okay oh okay I'm back I hope someone's
67:57 - gonna make me a pie song because I could
67:59 - really use a pie song now what I want to
68:02 - do now actually I'm curious here I think
68:11 - what I want to do is try to separate
68:12 - thing I should use a fix with if I was a
68:14 - file was to get more careful I would
68:16 - just use a fixed-width font which was my
68:18 - plan but I'm actually kind of curious
68:20 - here because in theory I could change
68:23 - this for loop to be a while loop and I
68:28 - could say here float X equals zero while
68:32 - X is less than with and then at the end
68:37 - here I could say X plus equals text with
68:45 - of digit I think the text-align:center
68:47 - is going to give me a little bit of an
68:48 - issue why is that not oh not digit text
68:52 - width of that string and actually if I'm
68:55 - drawing the text let's just get rid of
68:57 - the idea of digit entirely so I believe
69:01 - this will actually let's see what
69:03 - happens we won't we probably won't get
69:04 - we don't know how many pages we're gonna
69:05 - have so eventually we're just gonna so
69:09 - what I'm gonna do is say if in debt so
69:13 - I'm actually just gonna say break or I'm
69:15 - just gonna say how can I get out of both
69:17 - loops right here I mean I could say
69:19 - break cuz I'm in the wild like if I ever
69:26 - get to the end of what I have then I
69:29 - should get oh but I oh no no no let's
69:32 - use a fixed-width font not the well I
69:36 - feel like the problem is now I don't
69:38 - know when to go to another page I don't
69:40 - have to test the why no that's fine
69:42 - though that's fine
69:44 - no no that's still gonna work still
69:45 - gonna go to the next page when I get
69:46 - down so let's let's let's do something
69:49 - let's create a variable boolean finish
69:51 - this is an awkward way of doing it but I
69:53 - know it will work equal false and so
69:56 - here what I want to do is I want to say
69:58 - finished if I ever get to the end finish
70:01 - just true and then
70:04 - think I could sort of say if finished
70:09 - right like will continue get me out of a
70:14 - return I could return no because I could
70:17 - return but I need to I need to get to
70:20 - this exit and since I'm just in setup
70:23 - yeah return would be good so one I call
70:25 - this void render book this is work this
70:31 - is going to be worth it I'm gonna say
70:34 - render book all that the loading stuff
70:36 - and this has to be a global variable now
70:40 - the loading stuff will happen in setups
70:43 - till then I'm going to take all of this
70:45 - and put it in render book exit'
70:50 - footprint lines finish and exit will not
70:52 - will be here then I'm going to say
70:55 - render book and all I have to do is not
70:59 - have any of this finished nonsense and
71:01 - just say return so this jump
71:13 - whoops I think I'm back
71:16 - hopefully the stream has come back and
71:24 - the computer is now back so sorry about
71:28 - that uh open broadcast studio seems to
71:30 - crash every once in a while
71:32 - I think I muted by the way when the
71:36 - wrong thing but I double muted so I
71:38 - think I was fine all right so where I
71:41 - was is I does anybody does anybody know
71:47 - where it died
71:53 - [Music]
71:59 - I better go back pretty sure I had
72:06 - pasted everything into the render book
72:12 - function return' with type 1 ok so in
72:18 - other words it died while I was typing
72:24 - return right here you said okay I'm
72:32 - gonna go back a little bit further just
72:33 - in case there was an issue with what it
72:35 - actually saved so okay sorry computer
72:47 - crashed maybe an awkward edit point so
72:50 - what I need to what I can do here is now
72:53 - say return to exit completely out of
72:56 - this function I don't need all this if
72:58 - finished stuff anymore
73:00 - the total pages is kind of wrong like I
73:04 - don't but I but I think it's fine like
73:06 - this will give me I think it's okay like
73:09 - I just need to actually I think this
73:11 - could be like a while true basically I
73:12 - can just keep doing new pages but let's
73:14 - just leave it for right now
73:15 - so I think what's going to an exit but I
73:18 - have like the wrong amount of brackets
73:20 - so render book do the double loop oh
73:25 - this in oh oh oh yeah this is a while
73:29 - loop right and I'm at the end of each of
73:32 - going based on the text width then index
73:35 - is going up if I get to the end I'm done
73:38 - otherwise I'm not finished to page oh
73:42 - there's a missing this is a missing
73:45 - curly bracket right because the page is
73:48 - done at the end of the this is the X
73:53 - loop this is the Y loop so if I
73:57 - highlight this it should that's the X
74:00 - this is the Y that's the end of a page
74:03 - okay so let's see what happens here oh
74:05 - and now I need to call oh this should
74:08 - this and this should be here this can be
74:09 - here and set up and then I want to say
74:11 - let me just run this
74:12 - okay nothing now I'm gonna call render
74:16 - look so hopefully they don't it'll just
74:18 - go until it runs out of numbers finished
74:23 - how come I didn't see how come I didn't
74:28 - see multiple pages hmm well let's see
74:34 - what I got did I get anything in the PDF
74:35 - oh oh because it fit in one page I fit
74:40 - in one page okay so it fits in one page
74:43 - because the numbers are all just right
74:44 - next to each other okay easy easy all
74:47 - right so now let's think about how I'm
74:49 - calculating the width and height so the
74:53 - number of columns in wrote there the
74:55 - idea of columns is no longer relevant
74:58 - right and the idea of rows is honestly
75:01 - no longer really because what I have is
75:03 - I want a font size so I want a font size
75:07 - which would be the default font size is
75:10 - 12 but let's just set that so I'm gonna
75:14 - set right here I'm gonna say text size
75:17 - 12 and so I'm told somebody the chat
75:23 - said have to be earlier that 120% of a
75:27 - text size is the proper like line
75:29 - spacing so if it's 12-point text 12
75:33 - times 1.2 this would be about fourteen
75:37 - point four and sort of the line height
75:39 - so in theory I should be able to have H
75:43 - be so the width should be twelve the
75:47 - height should be fourteen point four
75:48 - maybe just round it to fourteen but I'll
75:51 - leave it as fourteen point four and then
75:54 - I know this total pages thing is
75:57 - nonsense now because I can basically
75:59 - just say I could just say while true
76:01 - like keep doing more pages until you're
76:06 - done so let's see if this makes sense
76:10 - let's see what happens here look oh but
76:14 - I do want to count the number of pages
76:16 - so I'm gonna say into page num equals
76:19 - zero and I'm gonna say page num plus
76:22 - plus and it's gonna tell me when a page
76:24 - is complete
76:25 - okay page page none okay let's run this
76:33 - finished oh because it again does only
76:37 - needs one page this is looking pretty
76:40 - good
76:41 - there's all my digits let's add the
76:44 - three point three point one there
76:46 - right oh it's kind of cut off at the end
76:49 - there so let me be let me make sure it
76:52 - doesn't get cut off at the end so Y if X
76:56 - is less than Oh with minus W with Mike
77:00 - because I want to I want to cut it off
77:01 - before I could say maybe W divided by 2
77:03 - but let's yeah W divided by 2 would be
77:06 - okay so let's do that that should fix
77:09 - that finished and now I have a new write
77:14 - that fixed that over on this side
77:16 - okay and by the way why not make this
77:18 - more like an eight-and-a-half by 11
77:20 - piece of paper so let's have that be 850
77:24 - 1150 okay
77:26 - book of Pi let's go for 1 million and
77:31 - let's do PI 1 million book of PI million
77:35 - - text okay you ready for this I don't
77:39 - know if it's going to work to go on to a
77:40 - new page but
77:46 - it's doing some pages how many pages is
77:50 - it gonna be to have all 1 million digits
77:52 - I'll be back oh oh no that's just a
77:59 - snare drum
77:59 - it's still going how do this turn into
78:07 - how to convert text to PDF
78:21 - I'm kind of surprised that it's going
78:24 - this many pages okay okay it completed
78:30 - at page 111 so now we should have this
78:36 - is the most insane way anybody has ever
78:38 - converted a text file to a PDF but
78:41 - there's a lot of wonder wonderful stuff
78:43 - what I'm doing here so let's look at
78:44 - this book of Pi 1 million texts and we
78:47 - can see here oh why didn't I get that oh
78:49 - I have to do this again it's bothered me
78:51 - that it doesn't say 3.1 there but we can
78:53 - see here look here's my book of Pi I
78:55 - fries some margins should probably some
78:57 - margins but here it is it's a hundred
78:59 - eleven pages of all and let's see how
79:02 - big this file is it's a 212 megabyte
79:06 - file which probably doesn't need to be
79:09 - cuz it's just a hundred pages of text
79:10 - but probably in the way that it's
79:12 - rendering it is a little bit crazy so
79:14 - okay let's let's just do one more thing
79:18 - let's go for ten million and let's add
79:23 - three point there so we're gonna add the
79:28 - three dot and we're gonna render ten
79:31 - million all right
79:32 - I'll see you if one about a thousand
79:35 - pages we should pay tribute about a
79:37 - thousand pages okay here we go I'll see
79:40 - you in a bit
79:54 - the kerning hurts me Oh
79:58 - Oh it's it's wrong okay hold on I got to
80:02 - fix that
80:03 - it's the text-align:center that's doing
80:05 - that all right I didn't actually let
80:13 - that finish rendering because it was
80:15 - nicely pointed out to me that the
80:16 - kerning is off it's really quite off and
80:18 - this is because I'm using
80:19 - text-align:center I think I have a nice
80:22 - I think I've so I could keep with
80:24 - text-align:center but I have a quicker
80:27 - way that I'm gonna fix that so let me go
80:29 - back to the 1000 when we go back sorry
80:32 - to the 1000 digits we just load 1000
80:35 - digits let me run this it'll be done
80:38 - very quickly I'm gonna open up this 10
80:41 - million file one so you can see that the
80:43 - kerning is all off is spacing between
80:45 - the letters and that's because I'm
80:48 - moving according to ahead according to
80:50 - that digits with but it's aligned Center
80:52 - so I really have to average Izu move
80:54 - ahead by half of its width and half of
80:56 - the width of the next character but an
80:58 - easier thing that I could do is just
80:59 - text-align:left and then draw everything
81:02 - at X and so this should fix that let's
81:05 - just make sure oh and then I also need
81:07 - to change this to width divided by 2 so
81:11 - let's change this that's finished and if
81:16 - I go to you know it says 10 million that
81:19 - should be no it doesn't look right I'm a
81:24 - little concerned that it hold on let me
81:25 - make sure my PDF actually updated let me
81:28 - delete this file and let me look at it
81:35 - again it's created at 3:53 p.m. which is
81:38 - the time now that doesn't look right
81:40 - still interesting to see these what is
81:46 - wrong here
81:50 - [Music]
81:54 - let's just do text-align:left for a
81:56 - second without the center for why
82:06 - why is that wrong
82:15 - this has always worked for me in the
82:17 - past I'm drawing a digit and then I'm
82:22 - moving according to that and drawing the
82:24 - next one text-align:left I thought I am
82:29 - here this is the character I'm drawing
82:33 - that's the width of that character and
82:38 - the next one will be at this location
82:41 - according to what it previously drew
82:44 - right as it draws one and then moves
82:52 - ahead according to that ones with not
82:54 - the previous ones with I mean the three
83:00 - taht is messing it up I don't think so
83:05 - I'm looking at the YouTube chat so I
83:08 - could switch to a monospaced font
83:22 - I move according to the next one now
83:25 - instead of fixed with nobody the chat is
83:29 - being helpful to me I mean you are being
83:31 - helpful I just mean you guys are talking
83:32 - about a four papers which is not helpful
83:35 - to me let me think about this individual
83:43 - characters when I'm drawing I move I
83:46 - wonder if you know what I have a bad
83:49 - feeling that it's something to do with
83:52 - putting it in the PDF because this would
83:56 - this is sort of based on pixels and the
84:00 - PDF yeah they all line up vertically Oh
84:03 - something is whoa wrong
84:06 - I think the PDF rendering is doing
84:11 - something mm-hmm I might have to just
84:16 - live with this right now or I could use
84:17 - a fix with fun right because I let me
84:22 - take out the just for the sake of
84:26 - argument here for a second
84:27 - watch let me show you this let's look at
84:36 - it without the PDF rendering
84:43 - no that's not really any better okay so
84:50 - that's a good sign
84:52 - yeah it's off that dot should be here
84:57 - why is it off all right so let me think
85:00 - about this let me make the font much
85:02 - bigger
85:03 - oh no this this I shouldn't be using
85:12 - anywhere okay I'm not oh there we go
85:18 - this is weird
85:20 - well that's okay that's just like
85:22 - approximate what am i using w anywhere
85:27 - else yeah that's fine
85:30 - that's sort of like silly but I'll just
85:32 - that W is irrelevant this is kind of it
85:35 - should just be like if the next
85:36 - character fits or not but I wonder if
85:45 - text width doesn't work properly if I
85:49 - don't specify the font
86:08 - oops
86:22 - I've definitely done this before without
86:24 - a problem is it is there a bug
86:44 - yeah
86:57 - look at that you can see how the one is
87:01 - giving a lot of space so hold on all
87:05 - right let's be a little bit more thought
87:10 - achill about this all right
87:20 - the three should be wider than the one
87:22 - oh boy that's not good that's not right
87:39 - little boy whoa boy
87:48 - is it because I'm in setup like do I
87:52 - need to get to draw somehow that doesn't
87:55 - make any sense though right like is one
87:56 - thing I could do I just say no loop yeah
88:09 - it's doing it does it not know how to do
88:12 - this with numbers
88:33 - well this feels like a processing bug
88:49 - I can't get anything to any two
88:52 - characters to be different oh all right
89:15 - yeah they're all the same so why is that
89:18 - that's weird no it's not a bug it's just
89:24 - how it works
89:33 - all right well I'm gonna switch to a
89:35 - monospaced fun
89:37 - no the X plus equals W is not aerial I
89:41 - know aerials not Manos paste so that's
89:44 - why I feel like these letters should be
89:46 - different widths but I'm not getting a
89:48 - different width well
90:01 - it's just an indication not a measured
90:04 - side all right why don't we
90:06 - I should just switch to a fixed-width
90:11 - font how about that everybody
90:15 - text with only updates once in setup no
90:21 - I feel like I've done this with like a
90:30 - string
91:01 - just look at all these yeah these are
91:06 - different so I get different look at
91:10 - this so why do I not get that for the
91:18 - numbers
91:31 - yes II like T is so I get different
91:34 - widths for all the letters like I would
91:39 - expect and then
91:53 - if I do the digits they're all the same
91:58 - huh
91:59 - numbers often are not properly kerned
92:02 - are tracked in fonts oh well that's
92:05 - interesting the font is just organized
92:11 - that way all right this is what this
92:19 - whole thing will get cut because that
92:21 - was an exploration that went nowhere but
92:25 - it was useful and interesting I was
92:28 - where was I I was making the 10 million
92:31 - it's fine the kerning will just be off
92:39 - and I will change this to a fixed-width
92:44 - font
92:58 - oops
93:08 - all right I'm actually stopping
93:10 - rendering that that file that was gonna
93:12 - have ten million digits in it because
93:14 - I've noticed that they Despain the
93:16 - numbers the kerning is off and actually
93:18 - I've done this before we're moving by
93:20 - text with works perfectly with with well
93:24 - doesn't work perfectly but I I don't
93:25 - have an issue with it but apparently the
93:27 - way this font is organized these the
93:29 - numbers are all that elbow all defined
93:32 - with the same width so I'm I kind of
93:33 - have done something wrong here I'm gonna
93:35 - switch to using a monospaced font why
93:37 - not
93:38 - so I'm gonna add to the code I'm gonna
93:41 - just say right here under render book
93:44 - I'm gonna say text I'm gonna say a P
93:47 - font F equals create font I'll just use
93:49 - courier I can use courier new but I
93:52 - think I'll just use courier and give it
93:55 - a size of 12 and then I'm gonna say text
93:59 - font F let me switch back to the 1000
94:06 - 1000 file just to test this let me run
94:10 - this it finished right one page
94:13 - let me look at this now 1000 whoops no
94:19 - wrong 110 million text whoops it could
94:23 - not open because it was empty what did I
94:24 - do wrong
94:25 - I messed something up oh I forgot exit
94:29 - exit needs to be in there okay let's try
94:32 - it again finished let's open that up and
94:38 - there now we can all breathe oops
94:41 - a sigh of relief all these numbers are
94:45 - nicely spaced from each other perfectly
94:49 - in mono spaced lined up exactly in
94:52 - organized fashion actually this is kind
94:54 - of nice because maybe we'll find some
94:55 - interesting patterns almost like a some
94:57 - sort of word search number search puzzle
94:59 - let's look at the it looks like we're oh
95:04 - I took out in my investigation of this I
95:07 - took out the text-align:center so let me
95:12 - put that back in run this one more time
95:16 - it's now finished let me come back over
95:19 - here
95:21 - oh right I messed up some stuff and say
95:24 - with minus 2x plus with / - I took out
95:28 - some stuff I why I was fussing around
95:29 - with trying to figure out the spacing
95:31 - finished and now there we go so I should
95:34 - add some margins let's add some margins
95:37 - let's say we're gonna start with X at
95:41 - 100 and Y at 100
95:44 - we're gonna go to with - 100 - W - and
95:49 - width and height - 100 so okay so let's
95:54 - make this let's make this a variable int
95:56 - margin equals 100 margin margin margin
96:02 - margin and let's see what that does
96:09 - and finished that's fine it looks like
96:13 - about an inch whatever so now we have
96:16 - our book of Pi now here we go it is time
96:19 - I'm gonna go back we're gonna make this
96:21 - book have 10 million digits and I want
96:27 - to emphasize that the way that I program
96:29 - this you could render each number
96:32 - individually as anything you want
96:34 - because they're all rendered one at a
96:36 - time in processing with any drawing
96:38 - capabilities that you could imagine okay
96:39 - let's go back and say PI 10 million okay
96:45 - I'm really gonna run this and I'm really
96:47 - gonna be back when it finishes see in a
96:50 - minute go let's just make sure it's
96:54 - going okay I think I'm consuming it's
96:56 - gonna be like well over a thousand pages
96:58 - see you in a bit
97:03 - yeah I don't have to get the text with
97:05 - each and every time
97:06 - that's probably slowing it down but you
97:14 - really think I wonder if that's slowing
97:15 - the Det this down like a lot cause it
97:18 - was gonna take a while let me fix that
97:22 - well we haven't gone too far let me just
97:35 - run it again see if storing the text
97:37 - with really helps not really that looks
97:42 - slower to me now am I just like running
97:47 - out of memory or something like why is
97:50 - that way slower now am I crazy
98:10 - yeah that's so weird I wonder it's so
98:15 - weird
98:26 - it makes no sense but let's put it back
98:28 - oh I've been debug mode by accident
98:33 - maybe that's why hi boxing click debug
98:36 - mode that's probably why it was slower
98:38 - whoops now what did I do
98:45 - margin 100 page number zero
98:47 - oh I undid too much
98:58 - well I think did I hit debug mode is
99:01 - that what happened let me just try one
99:05 - more time
99:06 - or does my computer just need like maybe
99:10 - like processing needs to be restarted
99:11 - let's try that like it's really like
99:16 - well let's just do let's just do that
99:19 - right all right hold on let me restart
99:21 - processing save let me close out all
99:33 - this let me sort of free up some memory
99:36 - empty the trash close out a bunch of
99:41 - things cuz like feels like it's churning
99:44 - to a halt a little bit Activity Monitor
99:54 - alright memory preview little preview
99:59 - has got to be killed that's an issue
100:04 - finder processing Dropbox okay this
100:06 - seems fine I think maybe we're in better
100:11 - shape now alright ready everybody here
100:14 - we go
100:19 - well who wants to wait for this to get
100:22 - to a thousand I got some other work to
100:25 - do do you mind if I just do some of my
100:26 - other work I get a check my messages I
100:32 - mean cuz that's getting to without me
100:36 - this is not crazy I can wait for that to
100:37 - get to a thousand is that 50 already I
100:39 - just have to wait that amount of time 20
100:41 - more times let me see if I have any
100:45 - important messages
100:48 - [Music]
100:56 - [Music]
101:09 - there's still two of them running in the
101:12 - background how are there two of them
101:13 - running in the background
101:14 - did I call render book twice no is it
101:22 - because I move stuff in to draw
101:36 - Oh before let's check Oh before there
101:41 - were okay
101:48 - I shouldn't start it over all right
101:55 - go computer go Oh guessing why it was
102:00 - slow okay
102:02 - [Laughter]
102:04 - seven minutes all right seven minutes we
102:07 - back in seven minutes I'm just checking
102:09 - out some stuff here oh oh oh this is a
102:14 - good time for me to mention my
102:18 - fundraiser I am running in a half
102:24 - marathon this Sunday
102:26 - I am matching any donations made today
102:32 - to this campaign Lower East Side girls
102:35 - club a wonderful organization that I
102:36 - have participated in some of their
102:38 - educational programs and so I'm gonna
102:41 - run 13.1 miles to raise a little money
102:43 - for the Lower East Side Girls Club if
102:45 - anybody wouldn't mind posting this into
102:47 - the chat wants to make a donation I
102:49 - would certainly appreciate that thank
102:50 - you very much okay so that's one thing
102:53 - I'll mention okay I'm gonna let this
103:03 - keep going I don't know that it's gonna
103:05 - be a thousand pages actually it could be
103:08 - like way more than a thousand pages
103:09 - because I don't I I added the margins I
103:16 - yes I would it's great to mention
103:19 - Stephen Hawking I don't know what else
103:20 - to say about that other than I was was a
103:22 - huge fan I still am a huge fan of
103:24 - Stephen Hawking
103:25 - I have read I don't know if I've read
103:27 - every single one of his books but
103:29 - certainly many of them and then the
103:30 - updated versions of them I don't know
103:37 - how many pages it's gonna be I could
103:38 - have pre calculated that I'm also
103:45 - curious will it report to me how big the
103:50 - file is while I'm running it No
103:55 - so let's look let's look at the memory
103:58 - usage
104:02 - the fan can you hear the fan so I don't
104:09 - know if it's showing up here under
104:11 - processing on a pi day so we're actually
104:14 - it's not going crazy here it's just
104:16 - currently using a small amount of memory
104:20 - in terms of the CPU usage
104:23 - it's definitely using that up and we're
104:30 - almost to 500 pages maybe we're about
104:32 - halfway through
104:36 - maybe check some new you know I'm I'm
104:39 - kind of exhausted by now it's four
104:41 - o'clock and I've been live streaming I
104:43 - had to take a break for about a half an
104:44 - hour 45 minutes was it an hour I don't
104:46 - remember but I started at about 11:00
104:48 - this morning so I don't think I'm gonna
104:50 - do anything else I'm just gonna let this
104:54 - finish and then I'll go okay
104:58 - I also have to go home because yeah by
105:14 - the way how many people currently are
105:15 - watching waiting for this to complete
105:26 - there should be some good I could read
105:31 - some numbers
105:32 - I'll let's read some digits of pi here
105:41 - this is just I could read a thousand
105:44 - digits of pi
105:44 - while we're waiting that's really at
105:48 - only a thousand digits right hun
105:57 - all right we'll keep an eye on the
106:01 - number see if it finishes all right now
106:10 - anybody wants to turn this into a song
106:11 - I'll be forever grateful problem is I
106:13 - have to look at the screen should I read
106:16 - it regular and then it'll be auto tune
106:18 - or should I try to sing it I'm gonna try
106:19 - to sing it Oh
106:25 - Alka seems to have calculating 855 why
106:28 - did you already render it so we're
106:29 - almost done better hurry up to read
106:30 - these 3.14159265 three five eight nine
106:35 - seven nine three two three eight four
106:37 - six two six four three three eight three
106:39 - two seven nine five zero two eight eight
106:41 - four one nine seven one six nine three
106:44 - nine nine three seven five one oh five
106:46 - eight two zero nine seven four nine four
106:48 - four five nine two three zero seven
106:52 - eight one six four zero six two eight
106:55 - six two zero eight nine nine eight six
106:58 - two eight oh three four eight to a
107:00 - regular limo Manuel Miranda
107:01 - I am five three four two time isn't he
107:03 - did it one one seven zero six seven nine
107:06 - eight two one four eight zero eight six
107:10 - five one three two eight two three
107:14 - [Music]
107:26 - two three one seven two five fifty five
107:29 - five four two eight one two eight four
107:31 - eight one one seven four five four ah
107:33 - seven four five zero two eight four one
107:35 - zero two seven 855 viewers not 855 pages
107:41 - I thought maybe somebody had calculated
107:42 - it yeah it'd be better to just oh boy I
107:49 - should have like you know what a mitten
107:51 - good maybe I should stop and restart it
107:54 - because they could report the progress
107:56 - like I could actually report like how
107:58 - many are on each page let's try to
108:00 - figure this out though think about this
108:02 - we can figure this out right the size of
108:05 - the box is well I'm gonna do this on my
108:13 - other computer right we can we can
108:15 - calculate this it's gonna be like
108:17 - fifteen hundred pages right this size of
108:20 - the box done there's eight hundred fifty
108:27 - five people watching that's insane this
108:30 - size of the right this would be really
108:32 - sad when there's a bug and it actually
108:33 - doesn't render 1 1 to 0 even one one to
108:39 - zero
108:40 - my calendar there's apparently something
108:42 - on my calendar that starts at 4:30 I
108:44 - think I got cancelled 1 1 2 0 8 60 was
108:51 - 110 pages for a thousand 1 million will
108:54 - be 1,100 to 1,200 that makes sense
108:57 - no but I'm doing 10 million I'm doing 10
109:01 - million so
109:08 - no but I was able to fit 1000 fit like
109:12 - on the page with a lot of leftover room
109:15 - 78,000 P do it by the number of digits
109:18 - that have been used versus the number of
109:19 - digits total I added the margins how
109:25 - many we lost 15 viewers in the last few
109:27 - minutes ago shocked alright let me try
109:29 - to calculate this it's 11:50 by 800 but
109:38 - minus a hundred for the margins minus
109:40 - 200 for the margins because it's 100 on
109:42 - each side so that's 950 by 600 that's
109:45 - the area each cell is what was it 12
109:51 - pixels each cell well we don't know what
109:57 - the text with would anybody know can
109:59 - anybody I don't want to stop this can
110:00 - anybody tell me what the text width is
110:02 - of Courier text size twelve twelve point
110:08 - the text width of one character is well
110:13 - let me just guess it's twelve if it were
110:15 - twelve that would be twelve times
110:24 - fourteen point four so I can fit 32
110:30 - about 3,300 on a page and so 10 million
110:36 - two three one two three
110:39 - divided by all of that how many pages I
110:43 - got 3000 pages my calculations 16 pixels
110:49 - is it really 16 because 16 will mess up
110:55 - my math right now I computed three
110:57 - thousand pages which I don't know if I
111:00 - have the stomach for if it's 16 pixels I
111:04 - just calculated 4,000 pages
111:12 - well at least we'll get maybe the some
111:14 - digits of pi in the number of pages 3.1
111:18 - 3003 thousand one hundred eight point
111:25 - six I don't think so okay I have to test
111:26 - this myself or maybe somebody in the
111:29 - slack Channel has yeah I could rerun the
111:34 - code but I don't want to because I could
111:36 - change a lot to sort of figure it out
111:38 - and I don't have the code on any other
111:40 - computer open a project and do it with a
111:42 - thousand yeah that's what I was hoping
111:45 - all of you following along could help me
111:47 - with it
111:47 - have you been following along couldn't
111:49 - you do the same thing and then someone
111:51 - else running this and started it a lot
111:52 - earlier and already is finished alright
111:55 - I am going to create a new processing
111:57 - sketch and I'm gonna say P font F equals
112:03 - create font courier twelve and then I'm
112:09 - gonna say print line text with zero and
112:16 - let me run that so I getting I should be
112:24 - able to fit more text font I didn't say
112:25 - text font F yeah I got seven point two
112:34 - is the width seven point two is the
112:41 - width which my math would then say I
112:47 - only need eighteen hundred pages maybe
112:51 - were yeah I'm the other thing I'm afraid
112:53 - of is that this is gonna run out of
112:54 - memory if it's
113:01 - how are we doing here let's look at this
113:05 - okay CPU usage no problem memory usage
113:09 - no we're good we're good we're good I
113:12 - think the multiple pages help well let's
113:25 - see let's see if it finishes before I'm
113:27 - gonna I'm gonna stay here at least till
113:29 - 2000 pages
113:34 - otherwise I will just do a dramatic
113:36 - ending of it still going I have to leave
113:41 - and I'm there like I'll be on like the
113:42 - subway of New York City with my laptop
113:44 - and the battery will run out though
113:47 - because I can't stop this program yeah
113:58 - but I'm literally advancing only the
114:00 - number of pixels so I'm not including
114:05 - because I'm not actually rendering the
114:07 - text as the text renderer would do I'm
114:10 - rendering each character one at a time
114:18 - okay I don't know what what sound effect
114:25 - I want
114:27 - [Music]
114:30 - start it again we have now fished at
114:38 - 1761 pages I have made a book just for
114:41 - reference this book is 200 pages
114:47 - this book is 200 pages I have now made a
114:50 - book that does seven 1700 I mean 600
114:54 - pages 661 pages which in theory has 10
114:58 - million digits of pi and plus the 3.1 so
115:02 - it actually has 10 million in two
115:03 - characters now let's go to my folder it
115:09 - is a two gigabyte file I wonder if I
115:13 - open it with like Adobe Acrobat Pro
115:17 - let's try opening with preview why not
115:19 - any preview we'll figure out how to do
115:21 - it I'm probably gonna have to this is
115:24 - probably gonna fail let me quit
115:28 - processing and quit TextEdit alright
115:34 - preview doesn't seem happy not
115:36 - responding let me try okay
115:41 - now preview didn't work let me now try
115:46 - opening this with I don't know Acrobat
115:49 - Reader or Acrobat Pro let's try Acrobat
115:51 - Pro that sounds fancy do I even have
115:55 - that I don't give me that as an option I
115:57 - must have some supper oh boy no Acrobat
116:03 - Pro for me okay yes I want to quit let's
116:08 - try Acrobat Reader agree yeah I agree
116:14 - take my book of Pi this looks good
116:19 - configured no no I don't want to be the
116:20 - default okay okay okay okay okay okay
116:23 - you gonna settle down settle down
116:25 - tutorial exit out of this I don't need
116:27 - to sign I don't not signing this
116:29 - document okay I don't need to sign in
116:32 - here it is this is the book of Pi it is
116:37 - to gave us now the absurd thing is once
116:40 - again is
116:41 - I could have just taken that text file
116:43 - and done print to PDF but if you wanted
116:46 - to you could render this and you could
116:49 - have I don't want to look close I don't
116:51 - want to see any mistakes you could I
116:54 - don't have the page numbers on it
116:56 - I should probably you CSS paged media
116:58 - and the whole other way like span tags
117:00 - oh I'll come back another time to do it
117:04 - a different way so but again I could
117:06 - have done the same exact thing but had
117:07 - these would be little blocks of color or
117:09 - anything so I will just do to finish off
117:12 - this video oh I made it go upside down I
117:16 - will read to you from page what page am
117:21 - I on I will reach you some why is the
117:26 - spacing off Oh cuz I have the center
117:30 - thing again I text the line center I
117:31 - need to text the line left I can't do it
117:33 - again oh I forgot to add page numbers
117:36 - chrome can open PDFs that's it alright
117:39 - now I I'm sorry that this spacing is off
117:41 - it really bothers me but we'll just have
117:45 - to go on I will read you a little bit of
117:47 - it and this video will fade away six
117:52 - eight eight five one one four five zero
117:56 - six four nine one three one five one
118:00 - eight six one five then there's some
118:05 - other digits for three in the mouse is
118:07 - really in an awkward place zero three
118:09 - one three one nine zero five six two
118:14 - seven one goodbye
118:22 - all right okay everybody that's the end
118:26 - for today
118:36 - yeah maybe it's an integer math problem
118:39 - floating-point problem because you're
118:41 - right if it's 888 isn't even so that's a
118:44 - bug I will be accepting pull requests to
118:47 - fix the spacing we'll do that another
118:50 - time I have to be done I am so I just
118:54 - feel like I wanted to eat really excited
118:58 - about this two gigabyte I don't know
119:01 - where to put it I know how to print it
119:02 - out
119:02 - I should be rainbow-colored with trains
119:04 - there should be it should be like it the
119:06 - book should have a flip should be a flip
119:08 - book so as you're also flipping through
119:10 - the book there's like a little animation
119:12 - of a train going train going by it's on
119:13 - a real animation the flip book animation
119:14 - so render it at a larger size so many
119:18 - things I could do wait for 314 likes
119:21 - okay how many people are watching right
119:23 - now I I will wait I'm first gonna check
119:29 - to see if anyone made the donation and I
119:31 - think maybe making donations to
119:34 - nonprofit causes of plugging them
119:37 - through a livestream oh my goodness holy
119:42 - smokes Michael D I have to read 320 that
119:49 - is unbelievable
119:51 - thank you that is so kind of you and
119:53 - nice of you to donate such a large
119:56 - donation that is getting me quite close
119:58 - to the goal that is really amazing to do
120:04 - that my goal for fundraising for Lower
120:06 - East Side Girls Club I really appreciate
120:07 - that I I must go now to the following I
120:13 - do have to leave but to thank Michael D
120:15 - I'm doing a file process and I am going
120:21 - to read do we get two did we get to 314
120:24 - already over great I am going to finish
120:26 - this livestream by outputting 325 digits
120:33 - of pi I now have a file that for Michael
120:39 - DS donation I will read all of these
120:42 - digits
120:48 - and I'll even add 23.1 okay here we go
120:52 - everybody
120:54 - [Music]
120:59 - oops
121:06 - look this went too high I wish I had a
121:12 - monitor over there and I could see it on
121:13 - it I really need to do that 3.14159265
121:18 - three five eight nine seven nine three

123:08 - eight eight one five thank you
123:12 - Michael d all right I don't hope I
123:17 - didn't mess anything up
123:19 - much I am going to go I will just make
123:22 - sure there isn't I'm getting messages I
123:25 - don't know why my family just doesn't
123:26 - like turn on YouTube to find me and then
123:28 - type into the live chat because that
123:30 - would that would also reach me I've been
123:33 - I this is like about four times as much
123:36 - as I intended to livestream today and I
123:40 - think we're good okay great wonderful
123:42 - this is a thrill for me to get this
123:44 - extra donation to have made these
123:46 - projects and now I have a new goal I
123:50 - feel like I couldn't read a million
123:54 - random digits so that was that was 325
123:58 - it just took a couple could I read 1
124:00 - million digits of pi in one day on a
124:02 - live stream because I thought if I ever
124:05 - get to 1 million subscribers I would
124:08 - read 1 million random digits but I did
124:10 - the sort of math for how long that would
124:11 - take because these are numbers between 0
124:14 - and 90 9999 it would probably take me
124:17 - Oh week without sleeping to read all the
124:22 - digits but I wonder if pie is realistic
124:24 - so I will see you all there will be no
124:28 - live stream this Friday there will be
124:30 - hopefully a live stream on Friday March
124:33 - 23rd I believe that will be the next one
124:35 - thank you for tuning in all of these
124:38 - video all of these will get edited and
124:39 - released at some point sort of insane
124:41 - how much that I did today so I've got a
124:43 - lot of content still to go and release I
124:45 - would like somebody remind me maybe add
124:47 - up to the rainbow topics repo I would
124:50 - like to make a processing library I mean
124:54 - I don't know if I want to show how to
124:56 - make a processing library using Eclipse
124:57 - Java and processing it some point I've
124:59 - got to get to that ok alright I will see
125:05 - everybody feel free to do what you will
125:08 - with all the weird stuff that I did
125:10 - today mash up cut chop release whatever
125:12 - and happy birthday pie happy pi day rest
125:17 - in peace Stephen Hawking
125:18 - happy birthday Einstein and check in
125:22 - with me on Sunday when I will be running
125:23 - my 13.1 miles ok goodbye

Cleaned transcript:

hello good afternoon welcome to part two of happy pi day on the coding train which is me again Daniel Shipman I am wondering if the music is sounds ok efforts all glitchy like it was this morning this morning I did two coding challenges themed round PI one coding challenge involved I don't see anyone saying anything in the chat it's always oh hi again great one coding challenge involved estimating or approximating the value of Pi using the a ratio of the area of a square to a circle so I did that complete head to snaps in a circle I also did a coding challenge where I sort of visualize the digits of pi very poorly I almost feel like that should just get thrown away but hopefully that'll be useful I'm gonna do another coding challenge right now where I visualize the digits of pi and but I'm going to do it in a book the goal is to make a book and I'm gonna start with a grid I tried this this morning and I got all turned around in my head so I had a moment I had a little sandwich I made myself some coffee I'm back so hopefully my voice feels a little scratchy so but hopefully I will make it through and what I'm going to attempt to do is design a book or a pink about as a poster first or even just a processing window where F which is a grid of tiles and every tile could display a particular digit of pi or a visual representation of that digit and one idea that I think came in through one of the github suggestions was to represent each digit as a polygon so 0 would be nothing 1 would be a point 2 would be a line 3 would be a triangle forward be a square 5 would be a Pentagon 6 would be a hexagon that sort of thing see I remember where all these things are septagon octagon 9 to takata 9 at 909 toccata Kentico to go to a dig on and then dodecahedron right there was at ten oh boy I was doing so well Tyler Davis asks if I will do a back flip and I will not know no amount I mean I will I try but I first of all I already have all sorts of issues going and I know I could not do a back flip alright nonagon dov'Ã¨ gone ok nonagon thank you alright so me and cat took Tong alright so look here's a bunch of digits of pi so I'm just gonna jump right in because I let me close this let me close this what do I got going on here that that doesn't need to be open processing needs to be open so let's see here let's include the let's keep that string of Pi by saying load strings PI 1 million txt index 0 and then 3 point in front of it okay so this should if I'm right let's get rid of this let's get rid of that nightmare this should I'm gonna get rid of the 10 million this is the 1 million ok and so and let's just make sure this works by chucking there we go great 1 million and 3 why is it 1 million in 3 shouldn't it just be 1 million in did I do something of that file 1 million in 1 I think I did something that file by accident probably like because I opened it in TextEdit I probably added like a space or something though I added a line break save glad I noticed that nope why is it still a thousand and one characters that makes me sad oh look I added something there and I by accident ok there we go ok I'm glad I noticed that boy would not like to have the first digit of pi be something weird yeah load string splits yeah ok letter I at the start thank you Jacob in the chat all right stretch everybody stretch before you start dealing with digits of pi elbow doesn't Bend all the way straight on the right side but it's okay I'm doing fine all right are you ready because I was born not ready at all I was definitely I've never been ready for anything mostly I'm just very not ready but let's go oh Tushar remembers 3.14159265 35 feet 979 that's way more than I could possibly remember hello and welcome to yet another Pi Day 2018 themed coding challenge in this coding challenge I'm going to attempt to make something that I am calling the book of Pi something exists like that already I want to make a book in the form of a PDF file that has maybe 1 million digits of pi visualized in some way you could flip through it and read it because well one thing I would actually have the digit make up high out of Pi so I have an issue which is that I have too much cable here we're gonna start over and we will have this book at the ready Joel in the chat rightz my love for pi is highly irrational but love it alright hello welcome to another pi day 2018 themed coding challenge and in this coding challenge I'm gonna try to make something which I am calling the book of pi now I really like kind of a strange person that you you've already well aware of this I really like books that are just full of numbers I'd like to read them quietly to my children at night time for bedtime 69 thousand one hundred and three fifty six thousand five hundred sixty these are some random numbers from the book of a million random digits now I would love to say more about this book I'll include a link to more information about this book in this video's description but what I would love to have in my hands is a book with a million digits of pi maybe ten million digits maybe a hundred million I don't know as many digits I could fit into a book so then from there perhaps even it would be you might think about making a giant poster that has every digit and then visualizing each digit at something like a color or a shape or creating your own piece of art from the digits of pi so I want this video to be a place a video that you can watch to get you started on this so what I'm gonna do to figure this out is I'm gonna first of all I'm gonna use processing which is a Java based programming environment from the processing foundation much more information about that below in the video description as well and I already have in the in this the data folder a text file with 1 million digits of pi I will include when I publish the code for this I will also include a link to ten million digits and 1 billion digits and you can find more as well so but I'm actually going to comment this out because what I want to do first is I just want to have a system by which I can render a grid because ultimately I'm going to have a grid of all the digits on each page and I want to render each digit individually right one thing I could do is just take that text file and do print so depite export to PDF that I want to be able to render all the stuff in an artistic way so I mean I'm not good at artistic way I want to show you how to do it so you the person watching with artistic talent can make something or just if you had some creative experimental idea don't feel any pressure to make anything quoteunquote artistic artistic with a lowercase a alright so let's start by I'm gonna create a nested loop with Y on the outside and this is I'm gonna do this in a sort of weird way I'm gonna say W equals I'm gonna just arbitrarily pick some numbers and I'm gonna so I'm gonna have a width and a height and have them both be 12 through the matters I tried to do this earlier today and I kind of mucked it up so I'm sort of thought about it a bit more which doesn't mean that I'll anything will be close to correct but I now have a nested loop and what I want to do in this nested loop is I want to draw a rectangle at every x and y that is the size of width and height and I want to give it a random color so let's just start like this the reason why I want to do this I want to see okay I can draw a grid of random colors now what I want to do just to get started is let me represent each digit of pi with a grayscale value so 0 only black be black 9 will be white and every other digit will be some color in between so how can I do that now what I can do is I can load my digits of pi file I this this is actually in there because the the file doesn't have it just starts with 1 4 1 5 9 actually don't want to include the 3 point but maybe if I make it a text version of it I will want that later so let me take that out so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna create a variable called index and all the way through the loop I'm gonna separately increment that index and I am going to get string digit equals PI car at index and maybe I want to turn that into a number right now so why is this oh it would want to be a character mmhmm let's will that know oh boy oh boy ah let's convert that to a string this is the awkward whose is awkward I don't know what I'm doing then somebody in the chat would tell me a better way but let's call this s and then I'm gonna say it digit equals I'll just convert that quickly from a string to a digit so I could have made it anyway so let's let's start with that and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a color I'll call it bright for brightness which I'm going to map that digit which goes from 0 to 10 to between 0 and 255 um so 9 should really be so I think what I'm gonna do just I'm gonna make this 256 and make this 9 no no 255 sorry 0 through 9 will that work I'm so confused already and this should be a float and actually yeah all right so let's let's do this okay here we go let's see what happens these are I think the digits of pi mapped to a grayscale value so the 9 are we seeing 9s are we seeing white the color white this could be a nine so what I would actually like to do now is write the digit in there so I could kind of debug this and see if it's working correctly so what I also then want to do is say text the digit oh I have a random in there oh the random thank you thank you to the chat this random should not be in there I thought that looked a little weird there we go so this looks better now 3.1415926 this seems right so so maybe I won't write the numbers right let's write the numbers in there just to be sure because I want to be able to write the numbers eventually so I'm also gonna say text the digit I mean I could use the digit at that X&Y and I'm gonna say fill 255 minus bright I'm just gonna invert the color and let's just see what happens there you can sort of see there are some numbers but they don't match up right so one issue is that when I draw a digit at this location right that top left it's actually appearing above so this is the wrong digit I want the digit to appear at the bottom so it should be y + H and I also want to say textaligncenter which should give me the okay that didn't work right because oh because so I'm going to say this I could probably I'm gonna say X + w / let's do that let's run this again does that I missed it okay see you again now now this looks right right one four one five nine two six five so we can see that it is mapping to the correct colors wonderful okay we're getting somewhere now these don't really look like squares to me weirdly did I say width and height width height height width twelve twelve I don't know maybe that's an optical illusion and I'm being told in the chat that I should try Center Center can ivory aline Center as well yep and then I could say height y plus height divided by two and now the digits are perfectly in theory perfectly aligned in the center of these what I believe to be squares you know what it is it's an optical illusion the fact that the characters are kind of elongated I think is tricking me into thinking those are taller than they are why okay so now we see that so here's the thing I want to turn this into a book or I at the very least want to render a huge version of it so the way that I want to do this is with the PDF renderer in processing so I'm going to go to the web and I'm gonna go to processing website reference actually libraries PDF export so one of the things processing has this size function where you typically will set the width and height of the window you can also set the renderer a renderer might be P 3d for 3d graphics but a renderer can also be PDF and when it renders to PDF it's not rendering the pixels of what you seeing it's actually drawing the vector based lines and shapes of what you're drawing so that this is now some you could blow up to be super highresolution or important to some other kind of program that works natively with vector files so so but actually instead I want to be able to still see what I'm doing on the screen so I'm going to go and get the look at this example with a screen display and I can actually just use size as normal but call begin record so I'm gonna say oops ah actually I don't okay I don't need to copypaste this I'm gonna say right here begin record book of Pi dot PDF I think that's all I have to say no oh PDF write PDF yes because begin record could also I think render out like a 3d model I think it's another version of and then I at the end I want to say and record so let's run this again oops oh I forgot I have to import the library so for to be able to do it I have to import processing PDF dot star this is Java syntax for importing a separate Java library so we see this here and now if I go to the sketch folder there's a PDF called book of Pi and I can blow that up and run around look at that so you can see here so even though it's zooming in I want to zoom in this way so you can really see right no matter how far i zoom in I don't lose any quality because this is actually drawing the vector path to this PDF now one thing we should look at is the size of the PDF this isn't so bad 163 kilobytes we're in good shape here one thing that I think that I want to do is let's change the well actually let me take out drawing the text I'm going to cook I'll come back to that now I just want to see how big can I make this so if I make this so what would be now let's say I want to fit all million digits into one page so let me keep it at 400 400 mmm let me think about this let me actually make this 800 by 800 just to start with something larger a million the square root of 1 million is what 1 thousands so if I want to have a thousand columns and a thousand rows let's start with something smaller let's start with a hundred columns and a hundred rows then the width should be the width divided by the number of columns the height should be the height divided by the number of rows right so this should be a that and then if I do print line I'm just curious index this should have gotten to 10,000 right this should show 10,000 rectangles there you go so that's 10,000 rectangles and that is now also in this PDF which is still right there so I can zoom all the way in and we can see I can zoom all the way out can I do view I just wanted to zoom to fit I guess it's already done that okay so we can see there it is okay now let's see if we can get all 1 million digits of pi so let's change this to one thousand one thousand in theory I shouldn't worry about the size of the window it's sort of irrelevant at this point although there's an issue with the numbers getting so so small that that might make the PDF rendering kind of wonky let's see what happens so this is gonna take a long time hold on take a break go get a cup of tea I'll be back I'm checking my email no stroke I should do 1000 by 1000 oh yeah this is gonna be a disaster yeah first of all I got an error out of range I'm back I didn't work actually got an error string index out of range 1 million so the index should never have gone to 1 million but I think I probably have a little bit of a rounding error so I'm just gonna right now I'm just gonna like not worry too much about that and say if index index is greater than s dot length then greater than or equal to X dot length index should equal s dot length minus 1 so this will at least get rid of that error but I just realized something if this is 800 by 800 and I'm playing to have a thousand by a thousand that's definitely not going to work I don't even have that many pixels so I possibly draw that many rectangles so let's try doing the size now this is why I kind of probably want to not bother to render a preview and I actually have a whoops sorry if this popped up this is why I might not want to bother to render the preview the preview is gonna be irrelevant but I'm sort of wondering if it kind of will make do once it goes to the PDF because this the actual pixel dimensions are irrelevant so I'm just curious I'm gonna let it go again and see what it does it shouldn't look like anything in the window but maybe we'll see something so 13 megabytes so this is the PDF I got that didn't seem to work it's all in there though cuz it is 13 megabytes oh well maybe it's just really slow to appear let's try let's try creating a larger window size even if it's larger than what I can see on the screen so what I want to do is actually I'm gonna say no stroke ooh this was for the text I'm gonna say no stroke to get rid of the outline of the rectangle and then also I am going to make this the size of four thousand by four thousand which should at least give me a 4x4 or 2x2 rectangle let's see if that what that does so it's much bigger than what I can display on my screen so I see all I still I'm a little concerned of my computer's ability to display the PDF some things there hmm that doesn't look right either this is the penis something in that PDF for sure let me go back and look here did I make some weird mistake mmm yeah I definitely want to use color mode HSB that's the next thing I'm gonna do to what extent oh yeah I have a new idea one is I'm gonna get rid of the PDF rendering and what I'm actually going to do is I am going to use create graphics so I'm gonna create an offscreen graphics context that's much bigger than the window and I'm gonna say P graphics and I'm gonna call this a canvas and I'm gonna say canvas equals create graphics that's I'm gonna make this quite big 16,000 by 16,000 gonna make a huge graphics window I think processing should be able to do that and then I'm just gonna have the actual size of the window be 800 by 800 and I still want to have columns and rows and now I want to say everything should be done as part of the canvas so instead of rendering to the window and though so now I want to say canvas fill canvas dot stroke canvas rectangle and then I am going to oh I just noticed something I just noticed something that I forgot about this is integer arithmetic so that's gonna really mess stuff up especially when I had only 800 pixels that's why I didn't see anything so let me make these just to let me make these floats because an integer divided by an integer will always be an integer oh no these were floats though never mind since column and rows were floats I'm wrong about that that actually doesn't matter here okay but it's weird that it's printing out the index still a zero oh because because when it gets to the end it shouldn't be zero but let's keep going with this canvas fill no stroke rectangle so now I need to say instead of begin record and say canvas dot begin draw and at the end so this offscreen canvas I could say end draw you can draw to it just like the window and then I can actually just draw the window right there draw the canvas right into the window so let's not go crazy let's make the offscreen canvas 800 by 800 and let's just have 40 rows and 40 columns okay there's some other weird mistake in my code s dot length two pi dot length oh look at this what a disaster I wasn't looking at pi anymore this whole time this whole time this whole time oh there we go hey look it's working now so let me just keep going with this method and I'll come back to the PDF this was good to look at anyway so now let me make the size actually 8,000 by 8,000 let me just do 200 by 200 what whoops no the size should be 800 and let me have this be 8,000 by 8,000 and let's see what happens here whoa something went wrong canvas dot with canvas dot height rows columns canvas dot oh I need to say I need to shrink it down now if they're not the same size so this is the giant thing now but if I were to say canvas dot save you know PI Post this is the poster of Pi and I say PNG poster of Pi dot PNG that's not right oh semicolon I'm gonna run this come on you can do it you can save it there we go all right so now it rendered it I see my preview here and if I go here we have PI poster which is a two megabyte file I can take a look at that and we can see this is what it actually is zoomed in so now can I fit all 1 million digits let's make that happen so now I'm gonna have a thousand by a thousand I'm gonna make it sixteen thousand by sixteen thousand so each each rectangle will be sixteen pixels by 16 pixels I think that's about right who knows who knows my math is off this is gonna take a while to render let's hit save bo go make yourself a cup of tea and I'll be back when it renders or what it says right here out of memory okay wait and we already got the out of memory error so one thing is I could go back to my nice PDF world which I wouldn't have this issue necessarily and but I can actually do better than that let's take a look at the processing preferences and go to here oh I've already given it four gigabytes of memory so I've already done this all right let's try making this smaller let's do let's do let's try 4,000 by 4,000 that should be fine all right see you in a bit oh there it is so 4,000 by 4,000 you can see here this is all that it's all one million digits of pi all in one window and if I go now to here poster of Pi a 1.2 megabyte file I open it up and look at this this is it this is it everybody this is now a a 4,000 by 4,000 RGB image with all the digits of pi okay we're getting somewhere we definitely should use HSB mode that'll be much more fun let's push it let's push it a little let's make it 8,000 by 8,000 to see if we can make that happen and let's change this to let's say I think I have to say canvas color mode canvas color mode HSB and let's just say one point oh let's have everything beef between zero and one and so now I should be able to say map this would be now be the hue and I should be able say hue 1 1 and this should go between 0 and 1 and actually be much easier just to say digit divided by 10 R divided by 9 right because I want to get to one point oh I think yeah all right so let's see what happens here that didn't work that's what I got that doesn't look right fill canvas colormode HSB one fill maybe is color mode not let's let's make this small just so we can figure this out let's make this small again whoa what happened here oh so let me let me indeed run this we see nothing let me try color mode oh did I say 250 no cuz I I made the this should know let's go back to what I'm used to oh I know if the problem was floating point math always gets me every time it's like the Vista of Java yeah so I think I was right all along I'm gonna have some level of confidence here loose a lot of blue oh right color mode back to I think No wait a sec here what have I got going on here Phil I just wanna tell you ten by ten it's just nice stroke mmm the brightness is one isn't it oh the brightness is one like these should be less like somewhere in the the middle like no cuz it'll be white no no oh it'd just be well yeah but so one thing I just want to know is let's leave it default there we go but it's not HSB because it doesn't actually take it from canvas dot really oh no no how come I'm not getting just HSB mode not work in this HSB mode not work in create graphics kind of want to take out the canvas dot let me just do that real quick took out all the canvas drawing oh yeah so for whatever reason I'm not able to get HSB mo to work oh I had it after begin before begin draw ah maybe that's the issue let's see was that the issue did I have it there there we go so let me let me back up here yeah okay this was the problem spent a lot of time debugging that you could check the live stream if you want to see it a little 10 minutes of me searching for this but I called color mode before I said big begin draw which is really a problem that's a very bad thing that's not going to work so I need color mode to happen after and in this case now I can I can set the hue I could set the hue I could I could I mean I should be able to now put it back to 11 if I want to use color mode HSB with a range of 1 from 0 to 1 and I should see there we go so now I see these are some digits of pi with a different hue saturation and brightness and maybe just for our eyes let's make the this seems kind of maybe do I want the brightness higher but the hue the saturation I don't know what I'm doing oh I think I just want it not as bright but I want it like I want it fully saturated yeah whatever you can your problem this is the problem I have a problem what my kids used to say so the problem is I'm terrible at design so but we're good it's where it's functional and you are better at making something beautiful than I am okay so let me go back now and say 1000 columns 1000 rows eight thousand pixels eight thousand pixels and here we go cut cut cut fulbright and zero such what I want full brightness and saturation I don't know it looked so weird let's go back to full brightness and saturation and now yeah I'm going I'm running it again with full brightness and saturation just to like leave it in the sort of default state here we go oh and I want this to be nine all right here we go ready I'll be back in a minute once it renders there we go tada there it is 1 million digits of pi all mapped to a to a different hue and let's actually open up the let's take a look at the PDF um it's not a PDF sorry the PNG which is just a 2.6 megabyte file and I can zoom in on it and we can sort of scroll around and see these are all the digits of pi mapped to a given hue so now we're getting somewhere now here's the thing I wouldn't go back to PDF land let me see if I could render this to a PDF okay because I think the issues I was having before didn't have to do with the PDF rendering they had to do with my own other kinds of mistakes so what do I need to do I'm gonna change this from and say let me think about let me think okay everybody stay calm I think what I would like to do is do the PDF rendering without seeing a preview because I think I could sort of double up the code and draw everything to canvas and the PDF but I think what I want to do is actually if I go back to the processing reference I want to do this single frame no no display okay because I'm just gonna trust in my code so I'm gonna get rid of I'm gonna what I'm actually gonna do is I'm going I'm gonna save a new version of this so that's like a version that renders a PNG file I'm going to say PI day five I got to rename all these and so I can muck around with this a little bit more I'm gonna take out the canvas I'm gonna take out the canvas I am going to again I'm gonna put this back to a hundred and a hundred I'm gonna say I'm gonna say a PDF book of PI dot PDF then I am going to say columns and that's good load the load the data up here then I don't need to begin record anymore if I'm so this is gone and now all of my canvas dots should be gone again because I should be saying just color mode with height hike with all this bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla this is some ridiculousness there that I don't need I don't need to draw it anymore I don't need to save it anymore what I just need to do is say exit so when I use the PDF renderer here it will automatically render everything to this PDF and then exit the program so this shouldn't take very long to run let me just run it and I don't see anything because now I have to go and look at this PDF which nicely there's only 114 kilobytes I can open it up and there it is why is it not a square it is a square I just I just don't know how to use the computer I wanted to zoom to fit I don't know why it's not doing that let me just do this yeah okay so there you go there it is it's a PDF then we just can see that this is a vector drawing because no matter how far i zoom in as much as it'll let me I still have sort of a nice quality there alright now let's get a little more ambitious let's have it be 500 by 500 and let's make the size a thousand by a thousand and really the size is sort of irrelevant at this point so we finished there it is this is now a poster PDF and I can zoom all the way into with all the digits of pi and now is it gonna be okay I think it'll be okay why not why not 9 and 0 or both red that is a good point because I'm using hue saturation brightness hue is an ant is think of it as an angle on the color wheel 0 to 360 and 1.0 and zero would be the same so this should be divided by 10 thank you for that excellent point me I am swimming in the chat let's run this again it hasn't stopped yet I should put so think like print line finished it finished though because I can see that the play button became disabled so let's look at this one more time it's an 11 point 5 megabyte file now and I'm going to open it up and there it is 1 million digits of pi all with a different hue arbitrarily on a grid do you see the secret encoded magical messages there these are such mono it's it's just it's just having a lot of trouble rendering it but you can see it's slowly coming into focus all right now I want to do something really exciting because guess what I want to do this oh I already did all 1 million so what I want to do now I could do 10 million I'm gonna open up no no no let me not be so ambitious let me make it a hundred by a hundred so if it is one oh that's a thousand pages so let's say I want to have it one thousand a hundred thousand per page to have it what's the square root of a hundred thousand I can get ten thousand per page that's what I'm doing here ten thousand per page that won't be that many pages let's do it yeah let me just easy math I don't care if it's a lot of pages 100 by 100 let's see what this looks like so we can see this is now 100 by 100 so that's one thousand ten thousand ten thousand that's ten thousand digits of pi represented as a hue okay now who okay this is very exciting what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna say for int I equals zero I is less than 10 so this is total pages I'm gonna say page equals zero no no let's just use I I is less than total pages I plus plus so total pages equals pi dot length divided by columns times rows print line total pages right this is if I only have it 100 by 100 but I have 1 million digits than I need and 110 thousand this is how many pages I need now I can say this many total pages in debt and then I can I'm gonna say print line page I complete has one page I complete I'm gonna put another bracket here and then I'm going to say ah so now if I go back to here what I for multiple pages I need access to the PDF render itself which I can grab right here after setup and then I can say PDF dot next page so I'm now going to make a multipage PDF with ten thousand digits on each page ready for this I'll be back when when it finishes or has an error I'm not sure which one oh that was kind of anticlimactic I could actually already see that I have an error here the variable total pages does not exist so I forgot to say int I want this to be an int okay let's try this again should never use the drum float does not match with int because these are columns and rows are floats that's insane what's wrong with you and then this needs to be a float okay this this fear flood I'm gonna just just just take your time these could probably be into boy Java you are fun okay wait alright I'll be back it's gonna render oh wait it finished 98 99 according to this it finished I now have a it's still a 10 megabyte PDF if I go to view thumbnails look at this page 1 page 2 page 3 page 4 page 5 page 6 page 7 all the digits of pi alright let's just see if processing can do 10 million digits okay so I'm basically done what I would love to see is like I'm gonna obviously this code will be on github I want to make a version that just like actually has the raw digits in it what's the most kind of interesting or strange way we can represent it can you fit it all into a big poster can you make a book let's make a coding train book of Pi together as a community won't that would be fun but before I go let's just push let's push it a little Thank You Andres Calibri creator of the OpenGL processing library we always like to say that okay oh did I do I still have it wrong the hue no no that's fine okay okay so now what I want to do is I'm gonna change this I have a 10 but I don't have the 10 million file so let me go get that 10 million file here it is thank you to this CS course or something at Princeton that I mean Pi Day whoops where am i processing pi day 5 PI 10 million save this file there I also by the way I have a link to a file with 1 billion digits so what I'm gonna do now let's see so I want to load the 10 million should we make it a 10 page book with 1 million each page now let's keep it with 10,000 on each page it's not too many pages 10 million oh let me just say book of Pi 10 million so I don't overwrite my other file when this inevitably dies wait let's put let's put like some more is this gonna be a round number 10 million divided by 4 40000 probably not anyway let's just keep it to 10,000 per page that's just gonna be a thousand pages right yeah or something like that who cares it'll compute it for me ready let's watch the console here we go we just need to get to a thousand pages I'll be back when that happens this is way more fun than I could ever possibly imagine okay page 999 completes depleted so in theory okay hey fell down train whistle in theory this file here woo whoops this is kind of a large file it is 104 megabytes it is a PDF that has a thousand pages in it with a rectangle with a hue map to the digit of pi it has ten digits what has gone on so I have no I've sort of suspect that my computer might have a little trouble opening this file but let's take a deep breath and open it anyway let's close this one and let's open this actually amazingly it did it instantly and there we go all ten all thousand pages all 10,000 digits now I wonder if you might just double check this for me I'm on page 80 and if you could just check if this sequence is correct I didn't make any mistakes with my code that would be really nice thank you very much I really want to see it with the digits ah okay but I gotta end this video um I hope that you make something with this make a poster that vivid and by the way one I'm really limited in my thinking here right because I am thinking only in terms of this works like linear order of columns and rows but it's so arbitrary right the digits of pi are one dimension or perhaps they're in some multidimensional space that we can't even understand but the fact that I'm arranging them in this sequence you should remember is completely our so mutt might be another way that you sequence these or visualize these in a giant PDF whether it's a poster or a book or something else share with me I'm gonna work on my own on making maybe I'll make maybe I know maybe I'll just make another video real quick all right make the text version of this so I'll see you at perhaps if I make that video in that video otherwise have a wonderful pi day I'll see you in 2019 who's on what's on page from 2001 did I get an extra page by accident oh yeah so my math is off we can see there's a blank page here at the end all right so now I'm just gonna send this to the printer the color printer downstairs nobody will mind right let's put this into a book so what I want to do now just just to satisfy my own curiosity just to satisfy my own curiosity let's call this text let's say so let's get rid of I just want it let me draw the rectangle I could leave this fill in here actually for the text no the stroke zero that would still be black and HSB I believe yes fill stroke zero maybe I should just make China it does it make sense to make a followup video oh I just call the next page at the end of the loop always that makes sense I mean should I make a followup video of doing the text and like I don't know what's what could be nice about that is I could actually do it with a non fixedwidth font the way that I built this and have these the X sort of move according to the width of each character that would be kind of interesting let me just let me just try this real fast and let me say ya know Phil I mean this is crazy for me to do let me let me just do the let me load the 1 million so I'm just quickly rendering the text version of this oh I have to do 100 pages do I have a smaller file let me get a small let me make a smaller file well or can I put oh I forgot about my whole idea of visualizing the visualizing the polygon thing and I was excited by that I'm too lazy to like make up smaller fiveoh so I have to wait till all nine ninety nine pages render like well I'll do it with 1 million it'll take less time than ten thousand see this is actually I'm finally actually doing something that makes sense I mean this would be I think highly problematic to try to do in JavaScript I would think oh whoa wait why does it have it shouldn't have a fill for the rectangle all right let me make all right I think I need to finish for today it's 330 and I could keep going with this forever and ever and ever but there is there are other things to do I think this is pretty good and I can work on the text version later somebody else will make one and I can show them next time all right anybody have any other questions you want to ask well I'll be back before 2019 I just meant the next pi day won't people 2019 although pi approximation day as we know I'm just trying to understand why the rectangle oh did I not ever set up I never set a background it's actually it's not doing anything oh I just never set a background of 255 so it's working and I can actually also take out let me take out the rectangle hold on everybody I just I've been might as well do this right now except I won't have the code the code will be different than what I started what I show in the video all right hold on let's back up let's just do this as another video I'm seeing silly I can't go sleep at night if I don't finish this so I think this is back to where I was right okay I can't resist I'm gonna do one more coding challenge video first of all I forgot I had this idea of trying to do the different like polygons for each one of these cells I'll leave that as an exercise to the viewer anyway I talked about different things you could do but I just want to see I want to kind of see the numbers so I'm gonna try to do this in a just to see how that works I'm not gonna do I'm gonna keep everything just black and white just the pure text but I'm still gonna draw each character each number one character at a time because that would allow for a lot more possibilities obviously again if I just want to make a book of all the digits open up the text file print export to PDF etc but I'm gonna draw each digit one at a time so let me try to alter this to do that so couple things one is let me do save as and do pi day 6 this is like apparently the sixth thing I've made I'm going to go back to book of Pi I'm going to 1 million texts I'm gonna and then I'm gonna load the 1 million Pi file and I'm gonna keep it at 100 I should really make oh it timeout let me make a smaller text file and I'll be right back this is ridiculous because I got a save as pi PI file process so what I want to do is create a sketch really quick where I do what I did before and I say pi equals PI dot substring 0 whatever I want 1000 and then a string output equal so let's let's do this let's do int N equals 1000 and string output equals new string 1 output index 0 equals PI saved strings PI pi n oh there's no million pi dash n dot txt so now if I run this oh this this come and this should be output sorry I always get this wrong comment output so if I run this I should see now in a PI 1000 which does that look like a thousand digits to you I don't know that seems like if it's a thousand digits right okay so I'm gonna grab this I'm gonna go and open my PI day five but no pi day six actually yeah and what I'm gonna do is grab quickly from pi day five or PI D PI pi file process the 1000 file pi day six okay right anybody see anything I did wrong yeah one kilobytes a thousand digits that's about right right yeah okay and then this can be 10 by 10 all right I'm back I I quickly made a file that only has a thousand digits of pi because it's gonna be much easier for me to test this stuff so let's go through this let me get rid of HSB mode wait did I make do I need to save a new version or did I already save a new version what was pot so I got four as I get I'm lost like what was PI day five and they're not even like in their own folder this is really ridiculous no no pi day five is fine okay so I already made a new version I'm back I made a smaller song okay I'm back I made a smaller file with only 1000 digits of pi I think that'll be easier to work with let's make it just ten by ten so it'll still be a ten page PDF I'm gonna get rid of color mode HS I don't want to deal with that I'm still gonna have this idea of multiple pages I'm still gonna and now I'm not gonna draw rectangles anymore what I'm going to do is I'm going to say so first of all I need to I need to add a background so I'm gonna make a white back I'm gonna happen like the background white before I start drawing let's go down here and make the background white then I'm going to say here I don't I'm gonna just say fill zero so every piece of text and then I'm going to draw the digit at a certain location I had this from an earlier coding challenge and I think that's it this should give me all the digits so this is weirdly gonna happen pretty fast but as we're gonna see I'm going to need to do some clean up clean up here so it did all the pages and if I go to which one of this which book of Pi 1000 texts we should see yeah there we go so we could see one four one five so a couple things one is I would like to include the I'm not gonna worry about the three point so one thing is I didn't think about the size of the text so the text size should really be related to the size of the cell um so I do you all remember if this is a time out for a second with an edit point do you remember what I said I'm gonna take a half an hour break and go make ourself a cup of coffee and have some lunch I took that half an hour break and it came upstairs I forgot to do one thing so I'm gonna take a fiveminute break right now you can guess what that is little bathroom break here for a second and I'm gonna put because it's distracting me even though I probably be fine I am going to put on this dot song and mute my microphone and be right back digits of pi you okay oh okay I'm back I hope someone's gonna make me a pie song because I could really use a pie song now what I want to do now actually I'm curious here I think what I want to do is try to separate thing I should use a fix with if I was a file was to get more careful I would just use a fixedwidth font which was my plan but I'm actually kind of curious here because in theory I could change this for loop to be a while loop and I could say here float X equals zero while X is less than with and then at the end here I could say X plus equals text with of digit I think the textaligncenter is going to give me a little bit of an issue why is that not oh not digit text width of that string and actually if I'm drawing the text let's just get rid of the idea of digit entirely so I believe this will actually let's see what happens we won't we probably won't get we don't know how many pages we're gonna have so eventually we're just gonna so what I'm gonna do is say if in debt so I'm actually just gonna say break or I'm just gonna say how can I get out of both loops right here I mean I could say break cuz I'm in the wild like if I ever get to the end of what I have then I should get oh but I oh no no no let's use a fixedwidth font not the well I feel like the problem is now I don't know when to go to another page I don't have to test the why no that's fine though that's fine no no that's still gonna work still gonna go to the next page when I get down so let's let's let's do something let's create a variable boolean finish this is an awkward way of doing it but I know it will work equal false and so here what I want to do is I want to say finished if I ever get to the end finish just true and then think I could sort of say if finished right like will continue get me out of a return I could return no because I could return but I need to I need to get to this exit and since I'm just in setup yeah return would be good so one I call this void render book this is work this is going to be worth it I'm gonna say render book all that the loading stuff and this has to be a global variable now the loading stuff will happen in setups till then I'm going to take all of this and put it in render book exit' footprint lines finish and exit will not will be here then I'm going to say render book and all I have to do is not have any of this finished nonsense and just say return so this jump whoops I think I'm back hopefully the stream has come back and the computer is now back so sorry about that uh open broadcast studio seems to crash every once in a while I think I muted by the way when the wrong thing but I double muted so I think I was fine all right so where I was is I does anybody does anybody know where it died I better go back pretty sure I had pasted everything into the render book function return' with type 1 ok so in other words it died while I was typing return right here you said okay I'm gonna go back a little bit further just in case there was an issue with what it actually saved so okay sorry computer crashed maybe an awkward edit point so what I need to what I can do here is now say return to exit completely out of this function I don't need all this if finished stuff anymore the total pages is kind of wrong like I don't but I but I think it's fine like this will give me I think it's okay like I just need to actually I think this could be like a while true basically I can just keep doing new pages but let's just leave it for right now so I think what's going to an exit but I have like the wrong amount of brackets so render book do the double loop oh this in oh oh oh yeah this is a while loop right and I'm at the end of each of going based on the text width then index is going up if I get to the end I'm done otherwise I'm not finished to page oh there's a missing this is a missing curly bracket right because the page is done at the end of the this is the X loop this is the Y loop so if I highlight this it should that's the X this is the Y that's the end of a page okay so let's see what happens here oh and now I need to call oh this should this and this should be here this can be here and set up and then I want to say let me just run this okay nothing now I'm gonna call render look so hopefully they don't it'll just go until it runs out of numbers finished how come I didn't see how come I didn't see multiple pages hmm well let's see what I got did I get anything in the PDF oh oh because it fit in one page I fit in one page okay so it fits in one page because the numbers are all just right next to each other okay easy easy all right so now let's think about how I'm calculating the width and height so the number of columns in wrote there the idea of columns is no longer relevant right and the idea of rows is honestly no longer really because what I have is I want a font size so I want a font size which would be the default font size is 12 but let's just set that so I'm gonna set right here I'm gonna say text size 12 and so I'm told somebody the chat said have to be earlier that 120% of a text size is the proper like line spacing so if it's 12point text 12 times 1.2 this would be about fourteen point four and sort of the line height so in theory I should be able to have H be so the width should be twelve the height should be fourteen point four maybe just round it to fourteen but I'll leave it as fourteen point four and then I know this total pages thing is nonsense now because I can basically just say I could just say while true like keep doing more pages until you're done so let's see if this makes sense let's see what happens here look oh but I do want to count the number of pages so I'm gonna say into page num equals zero and I'm gonna say page num plus plus and it's gonna tell me when a page is complete okay page page none okay let's run this finished oh because it again does only needs one page this is looking pretty good there's all my digits let's add the three point three point one there right oh it's kind of cut off at the end there so let me be let me make sure it doesn't get cut off at the end so Y if X is less than Oh with minus W with Mike because I want to I want to cut it off before I could say maybe W divided by 2 but let's yeah W divided by 2 would be okay so let's do that that should fix that finished and now I have a new write that fixed that over on this side okay and by the way why not make this more like an eightandahalf by 11 piece of paper so let's have that be 850 1150 okay book of Pi let's go for 1 million and let's do PI 1 million book of PI million text okay you ready for this I don't know if it's going to work to go on to a new page but it's doing some pages how many pages is it gonna be to have all 1 million digits I'll be back oh oh no that's just a snare drum it's still going how do this turn into how to convert text to PDF I'm kind of surprised that it's going this many pages okay okay it completed at page 111 so now we should have this is the most insane way anybody has ever converted a text file to a PDF but there's a lot of wonder wonderful stuff what I'm doing here so let's look at this book of Pi 1 million texts and we can see here oh why didn't I get that oh I have to do this again it's bothered me that it doesn't say 3.1 there but we can see here look here's my book of Pi I fries some margins should probably some margins but here it is it's a hundred eleven pages of all and let's see how big this file is it's a 212 megabyte file which probably doesn't need to be cuz it's just a hundred pages of text but probably in the way that it's rendering it is a little bit crazy so okay let's let's just do one more thing let's go for ten million and let's add three point there so we're gonna add the three dot and we're gonna render ten million all right I'll see you if one about a thousand pages we should pay tribute about a thousand pages okay here we go I'll see you in a bit the kerning hurts me Oh Oh it's it's wrong okay hold on I got to fix that it's the textaligncenter that's doing that all right I didn't actually let that finish rendering because it was nicely pointed out to me that the kerning is off it's really quite off and this is because I'm using textaligncenter I think I have a nice I think I've so I could keep with textaligncenter but I have a quicker way that I'm gonna fix that so let me go back to the 1000 when we go back sorry to the 1000 digits we just load 1000 digits let me run this it'll be done very quickly I'm gonna open up this 10 million file one so you can see that the kerning is all off is spacing between the letters and that's because I'm moving according to ahead according to that digits with but it's aligned Center so I really have to average Izu move ahead by half of its width and half of the width of the next character but an easier thing that I could do is just textalignleft and then draw everything at X and so this should fix that let's just make sure oh and then I also need to change this to width divided by 2 so let's change this that's finished and if I go to you know it says 10 million that should be no it doesn't look right I'm a little concerned that it hold on let me make sure my PDF actually updated let me delete this file and let me look at it again it's created at 353 p.m. which is the time now that doesn't look right still interesting to see these what is wrong here let's just do textalignleft for a second without the center for why why is that wrong this has always worked for me in the past I'm drawing a digit and then I'm moving according to that and drawing the next one textalignleft I thought I am here this is the character I'm drawing that's the width of that character and the next one will be at this location according to what it previously drew right as it draws one and then moves ahead according to that ones with not the previous ones with I mean the three taht is messing it up I don't think so I'm looking at the YouTube chat so I could switch to a monospaced font I move according to the next one now instead of fixed with nobody the chat is being helpful to me I mean you are being helpful I just mean you guys are talking about a four papers which is not helpful to me let me think about this individual characters when I'm drawing I move I wonder if you know what I have a bad feeling that it's something to do with putting it in the PDF because this would this is sort of based on pixels and the PDF yeah they all line up vertically Oh something is whoa wrong I think the PDF rendering is doing something mmhmm I might have to just live with this right now or I could use a fix with fun right because I let me take out the just for the sake of argument here for a second watch let me show you this let's look at it without the PDF rendering no that's not really any better okay so that's a good sign yeah it's off that dot should be here why is it off all right so let me think about this let me make the font much bigger oh no this this I shouldn't be using anywhere okay I'm not oh there we go this is weird well that's okay that's just like approximate what am i using w anywhere else yeah that's fine that's sort of like silly but I'll just that W is irrelevant this is kind of it should just be like if the next character fits or not but I wonder if text width doesn't work properly if I don't specify the font oops I've definitely done this before without a problem is it is there a bug yeah look at that you can see how the one is giving a lot of space so hold on all right let's be a little bit more thought achill about this all right the three should be wider than the one oh boy that's not good that's not right little boy whoa boy is it because I'm in setup like do I need to get to draw somehow that doesn't make any sense though right like is one thing I could do I just say no loop yeah it's doing it does it not know how to do this with numbers well this feels like a processing bug I can't get anything to any two characters to be different oh all right yeah they're all the same so why is that that's weird no it's not a bug it's just how it works all right well I'm gonna switch to a monospaced fun no the X plus equals W is not aerial I know aerials not Manos paste so that's why I feel like these letters should be different widths but I'm not getting a different width well it's just an indication not a measured side all right why don't we I should just switch to a fixedwidth font how about that everybody text with only updates once in setup no I feel like I've done this with like a string just look at all these yeah these are different so I get different look at this so why do I not get that for the numbers yes II like T is so I get different widths for all the letters like I would expect and then if I do the digits they're all the same huh numbers often are not properly kerned are tracked in fonts oh well that's interesting the font is just organized that way all right this is what this whole thing will get cut because that was an exploration that went nowhere but it was useful and interesting I was where was I I was making the 10 million it's fine the kerning will just be off and I will change this to a fixedwidth font oops all right I'm actually stopping rendering that that file that was gonna have ten million digits in it because I've noticed that they Despain the numbers the kerning is off and actually I've done this before we're moving by text with works perfectly with with well doesn't work perfectly but I I don't have an issue with it but apparently the way this font is organized these the numbers are all that elbow all defined with the same width so I'm I kind of have done something wrong here I'm gonna switch to using a monospaced font why not so I'm gonna add to the code I'm gonna just say right here under render book I'm gonna say text I'm gonna say a P font F equals create font I'll just use courier I can use courier new but I think I'll just use courier and give it a size of 12 and then I'm gonna say text font F let me switch back to the 1000 1000 file just to test this let me run this it finished right one page let me look at this now 1000 whoops no wrong 110 million text whoops it could not open because it was empty what did I do wrong I messed something up oh I forgot exit exit needs to be in there okay let's try it again finished let's open that up and there now we can all breathe oops a sigh of relief all these numbers are nicely spaced from each other perfectly in mono spaced lined up exactly in organized fashion actually this is kind of nice because maybe we'll find some interesting patterns almost like a some sort of word search number search puzzle let's look at the it looks like we're oh I took out in my investigation of this I took out the textaligncenter so let me put that back in run this one more time it's now finished let me come back over here oh right I messed up some stuff and say with minus 2x plus with / I took out some stuff I why I was fussing around with trying to figure out the spacing finished and now there we go so I should add some margins let's add some margins let's say we're gonna start with X at 100 and Y at 100 we're gonna go to with 100 W and width and height 100 so okay so let's make this let's make this a variable int margin equals 100 margin margin margin margin and let's see what that does and finished that's fine it looks like about an inch whatever so now we have our book of Pi now here we go it is time I'm gonna go back we're gonna make this book have 10 million digits and I want to emphasize that the way that I program this you could render each number individually as anything you want because they're all rendered one at a time in processing with any drawing capabilities that you could imagine okay let's go back and say PI 10 million okay I'm really gonna run this and I'm really gonna be back when it finishes see in a minute go let's just make sure it's going okay I think I'm consuming it's gonna be like well over a thousand pages see you in a bit yeah I don't have to get the text with each and every time that's probably slowing it down but you really think I wonder if that's slowing the Det this down like a lot cause it was gonna take a while let me fix that well we haven't gone too far let me just run it again see if storing the text with really helps not really that looks slower to me now am I just like running out of memory or something like why is that way slower now am I crazy yeah that's so weird I wonder it's so weird it makes no sense but let's put it back oh I've been debug mode by accident maybe that's why hi boxing click debug mode that's probably why it was slower whoops now what did I do margin 100 page number zero oh I undid too much well I think did I hit debug mode is that what happened let me just try one more time or does my computer just need like maybe like processing needs to be restarted let's try that like it's really like well let's just do let's just do that right all right hold on let me restart processing save let me close out all this let me sort of free up some memory empty the trash close out a bunch of things cuz like feels like it's churning to a halt a little bit Activity Monitor alright memory preview little preview has got to be killed that's an issue finder processing Dropbox okay this seems fine I think maybe we're in better shape now alright ready everybody here we go well who wants to wait for this to get to a thousand I got some other work to do do you mind if I just do some of my other work I get a check my messages I mean cuz that's getting to without me this is not crazy I can wait for that to get to a thousand is that 50 already I just have to wait that amount of time 20 more times let me see if I have any important messages there's still two of them running in the background how are there two of them running in the background did I call render book twice no is it because I move stuff in to draw Oh before let's check Oh before there were okay I shouldn't start it over all right go computer go Oh guessing why it was slow okay [Laughter] seven minutes all right seven minutes we back in seven minutes I'm just checking out some stuff here oh oh oh this is a good time for me to mention my fundraiser I am running in a half marathon this Sunday I am matching any donations made today to this campaign Lower East Side girls club a wonderful organization that I have participated in some of their educational programs and so I'm gonna run 13.1 miles to raise a little money for the Lower East Side Girls Club if anybody wouldn't mind posting this into the chat wants to make a donation I would certainly appreciate that thank you very much okay so that's one thing I'll mention okay I'm gonna let this keep going I don't know that it's gonna be a thousand pages actually it could be like way more than a thousand pages because I don't I I added the margins I yes I would it's great to mention Stephen Hawking I don't know what else to say about that other than I was was a huge fan I still am a huge fan of Stephen Hawking I have read I don't know if I've read every single one of his books but certainly many of them and then the updated versions of them I don't know how many pages it's gonna be I could have pre calculated that I'm also curious will it report to me how big the file is while I'm running it No so let's look let's look at the memory usage the fan can you hear the fan so I don't know if it's showing up here under processing on a pi day so we're actually it's not going crazy here it's just currently using a small amount of memory in terms of the CPU usage it's definitely using that up and we're almost to 500 pages maybe we're about halfway through maybe check some new you know I'm I'm kind of exhausted by now it's four o'clock and I've been live streaming I had to take a break for about a half an hour 45 minutes was it an hour I don't remember but I started at about 1100 this morning so I don't think I'm gonna do anything else I'm just gonna let this finish and then I'll go okay I also have to go home because yeah by the way how many people currently are watching waiting for this to complete there should be some good I could read some numbers I'll let's read some digits of pi here this is just I could read a thousand digits of pi while we're waiting that's really at only a thousand digits right hun all right we'll keep an eye on the number see if it finishes all right now anybody wants to turn this into a song I'll be forever grateful problem is I have to look at the screen should I read it regular and then it'll be auto tune or should I try to sing it I'm gonna try to sing it Oh Alka seems to have calculating 855 why did you already render it so we're almost done better hurry up to read these 3.14159265 three five eight nine seven nine three two three eight four six two six four three three eight three two seven nine five zero two eight eight four one nine seven one six nine three nine nine three seven five one oh five eight two zero nine seven four nine four four five nine two three zero seven eight one six four zero six two eight six two zero eight nine nine eight six two eight oh three four eight to a regular limo Manuel Miranda I am five three four two time isn't he did it one one seven zero six seven nine eight two one four eight zero eight six five one three two eight two three two three one seven two five fifty five five four two eight one two eight four eight one one seven four five four ah seven four five zero two eight four one zero two seven 855 viewers not 855 pages I thought maybe somebody had calculated it yeah it'd be better to just oh boy I should have like you know what a mitten good maybe I should stop and restart it because they could report the progress like I could actually report like how many are on each page let's try to figure this out though think about this we can figure this out right the size of the box is well I'm gonna do this on my other computer right we can we can calculate this it's gonna be like fifteen hundred pages right this size of the box done there's eight hundred fifty five people watching that's insane this size of the right this would be really sad when there's a bug and it actually doesn't render 1 1 to 0 even one one to zero my calendar there's apparently something on my calendar that starts at 430 I think I got cancelled 1 1 2 0 8 60 was 110 pages for a thousand 1 million will be 1,100 to 1,200 that makes sense no but I'm doing 10 million I'm doing 10 million so no but I was able to fit 1000 fit like on the page with a lot of leftover room 78,000 P do it by the number of digits that have been used versus the number of digits total I added the margins how many we lost 15 viewers in the last few minutes ago shocked alright let me try to calculate this it's 1150 by 800 but minus a hundred for the margins minus 200 for the margins because it's 100 on each side so that's 950 by 600 that's the area each cell is what was it 12 pixels each cell well we don't know what the text with would anybody know can anybody I don't want to stop this can anybody tell me what the text width is of Courier text size twelve twelve point the text width of one character is well let me just guess it's twelve if it were twelve that would be twelve times fourteen point four so I can fit 32 about 3,300 on a page and so 10 million two three one two three divided by all of that how many pages I got 3000 pages my calculations 16 pixels is it really 16 because 16 will mess up my math right now I computed three thousand pages which I don't know if I have the stomach for if it's 16 pixels I just calculated 4,000 pages well at least we'll get maybe the some digits of pi in the number of pages 3.1 3003 thousand one hundred eight point six I don't think so okay I have to test this myself or maybe somebody in the slack Channel has yeah I could rerun the code but I don't want to because I could change a lot to sort of figure it out and I don't have the code on any other computer open a project and do it with a thousand yeah that's what I was hoping all of you following along could help me with it have you been following along couldn't you do the same thing and then someone else running this and started it a lot earlier and already is finished alright I am going to create a new processing sketch and I'm gonna say P font F equals create font courier twelve and then I'm gonna say print line text with zero and let me run that so I getting I should be able to fit more text font I didn't say text font F yeah I got seven point two is the width seven point two is the width which my math would then say I only need eighteen hundred pages maybe were yeah I'm the other thing I'm afraid of is that this is gonna run out of memory if it's how are we doing here let's look at this okay CPU usage no problem memory usage no we're good we're good we're good I think the multiple pages help well let's see let's see if it finishes before I'm gonna I'm gonna stay here at least till 2000 pages otherwise I will just do a dramatic ending of it still going I have to leave and I'm there like I'll be on like the subway of New York City with my laptop and the battery will run out though because I can't stop this program yeah but I'm literally advancing only the number of pixels so I'm not including because I'm not actually rendering the text as the text renderer would do I'm rendering each character one at a time okay I don't know what what sound effect I want start it again we have now fished at 1761 pages I have made a book just for reference this book is 200 pages this book is 200 pages I have now made a book that does seven 1700 I mean 600 pages 661 pages which in theory has 10 million digits of pi and plus the 3.1 so it actually has 10 million in two characters now let's go to my folder it is a two gigabyte file I wonder if I open it with like Adobe Acrobat Pro let's try opening with preview why not any preview we'll figure out how to do it I'm probably gonna have to this is probably gonna fail let me quit processing and quit TextEdit alright preview doesn't seem happy not responding let me try okay now preview didn't work let me now try opening this with I don't know Acrobat Reader or Acrobat Pro let's try Acrobat Pro that sounds fancy do I even have that I don't give me that as an option I must have some supper oh boy no Acrobat Pro for me okay yes I want to quit let's try Acrobat Reader agree yeah I agree take my book of Pi this looks good configured no no I don't want to be the default okay okay okay okay okay okay you gonna settle down settle down tutorial exit out of this I don't need to sign I don't not signing this document okay I don't need to sign in here it is this is the book of Pi it is to gave us now the absurd thing is once again is I could have just taken that text file and done print to PDF but if you wanted to you could render this and you could have I don't want to look close I don't want to see any mistakes you could I don't have the page numbers on it I should probably you CSS paged media and the whole other way like span tags oh I'll come back another time to do it a different way so but again I could have done the same exact thing but had these would be little blocks of color or anything so I will just do to finish off this video oh I made it go upside down I will read to you from page what page am I on I will reach you some why is the spacing off Oh cuz I have the center thing again I text the line center I need to text the line left I can't do it again oh I forgot to add page numbers chrome can open PDFs that's it alright now I I'm sorry that this spacing is off it really bothers me but we'll just have to go on I will read you a little bit of it and this video will fade away six eight eight five one one four five zero six four nine one three one five one eight six one five then there's some other digits for three in the mouse is really in an awkward place zero three one three one nine zero five six two seven one goodbye all right okay everybody that's the end for today yeah maybe it's an integer math problem floatingpoint problem because you're right if it's 888 isn't even so that's a bug I will be accepting pull requests to fix the spacing we'll do that another time I have to be done I am so I just feel like I wanted to eat really excited about this two gigabyte I don't know where to put it I know how to print it out I should be rainbowcolored with trains there should be it should be like it the book should have a flip should be a flip book so as you're also flipping through the book there's like a little animation of a train going train going by it's on a real animation the flip book animation so render it at a larger size so many things I could do wait for 314 likes okay how many people are watching right now I I will wait I'm first gonna check to see if anyone made the donation and I think maybe making donations to nonprofit causes of plugging them through a livestream oh my goodness holy smokes Michael D I have to read 320 that is unbelievable thank you that is so kind of you and nice of you to donate such a large donation that is getting me quite close to the goal that is really amazing to do that my goal for fundraising for Lower East Side Girls Club I really appreciate that I I must go now to the following I do have to leave but to thank Michael D I'm doing a file process and I am going to read do we get two did we get to 314 already over great I am going to finish this livestream by outputting 325 digits of pi I now have a file that for Michael DS donation I will read all of these digits and I'll even add 23.1 okay here we go everybody oops look this went too high I wish I had a monitor over there and I could see it on it I really need to do that 3.14159265 three five eight nine seven nine three two three eight four six two four three three eight three two seven nine five zero two eight eight four one nine seven

seven four eight eight one five thank you Michael d all right I don't hope I didn't mess anything up much I am going to go I will just make sure there isn't I'm getting messages I don't know why my family just doesn't like turn on YouTube to find me and then type into the live chat because that would that would also reach me I've been I this is like about four times as much as I intended to livestream today and I think we're good okay great wonderful this is a thrill for me to get this extra donation to have made these projects and now I have a new goal I feel like I couldn't read a million random digits so that was that was 325 it just took a couple could I read 1 million digits of pi in one day on a live stream because I thought if I ever get to 1 million subscribers I would read 1 million random digits but I did the sort of math for how long that would take because these are numbers between 0 and 90 9999 it would probably take me Oh week without sleeping to read all the digits but I wonder if pie is realistic so I will see you all there will be no live stream this Friday there will be hopefully a live stream on Friday March 23rd I believe that will be the next one thank you for tuning in all of these video all of these will get edited and released at some point sort of insane how much that I did today so I've got a lot of content still to go and release I would like somebody remind me maybe add up to the rainbow topics repo I would like to make a processing library I mean I don't know if I want to show how to make a processing library using Eclipse Java and processing it some point I've got to get to that ok alright I will see everybody feel free to do what you will with all the weird stuff that I did today mash up cut chop release whatever and happy birthday pie happy pi day rest in peace Stephen Hawking happy birthday Einstein and check in with me on Sunday when I will be running my 13.1 miles ok goodbye
