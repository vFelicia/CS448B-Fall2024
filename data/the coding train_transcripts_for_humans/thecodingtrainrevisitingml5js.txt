04:03 - further away from the mic
04:05 - i must be further away can you hear me
04:06 - going further away from the mic
04:10 - i do not understand
04:16 - um all right hold on let's get the
04:20 - camera on me
04:22 - hello good morning oh no i just filled a
04:25 - bottle of water
04:29 - welcome to the clothing train where i
04:31 - stole water on my laptop
04:35 - look everything's unplugged oh my god
04:42 - okay now can you hear me
04:46 - you can still hear me this makes no
04:48 - sense
04:51 - this makes no sense hold on is this
04:54 - the microphone
05:00 - i know how to mute it because i see the
05:01 - audio input
05:06 - but i have to put my mask back on
05:09 - because i i
05:10 - am here if i just leave the room will
05:13 - you still be able to hear me
05:14 - i have to go get some paper towels i'll
05:16 - be right back i can't play music i can't
05:18 - do anything just look
05:20 - at the coding train scene
05:23 - is very little water actually got on the
05:25 - laptop
05:27 - it mostly got on this uh
05:32 - cable and dongle
05:36 - not the mic what light could it be
05:39 - all right we're gonna figure this out
05:40 - but first i'm gonna get some paper
05:41 - towels
05:42 - i will be right back
06:04 - so
06:32 - so
06:39 - okay i'm gonna wipe this up here
06:43 - actually i also have this magic green
06:46 - rag
06:48 - it's my invisibility cloak
06:53 - i will also use to wipe this up
06:57 - then let's have a look here at the
07:01 - computer it's just a little bit of like
07:03 - a little splash on the keyboard i think
07:05 - it's fine
07:07 - we'll find out soon enough
07:10 - whoa what just happened there oh this
07:13 - camera went on
07:14 - that's particularly weird why is this
07:17 - camera on
07:21 - this is going super well so far
07:27 - okay i think i know
07:31 - i mean i don't really know but let me
07:33 - take a look here so first
07:36 - um the sound is great so why change it
07:41 - does it actually sound good it doesn't
07:42 - make any sense
07:44 - this is my microphone good morning
07:47 - by the way what you're actually watching
07:49 - is a sneak preview
07:50 - of what you get to watch if you become a
07:52 - member
07:54 - of the coding train because i actually
07:56 - do usually these friday
07:58 - sessions just with the members and i
08:00 - record
08:01 - uh video tutorials that later get
08:03 - released for example um
08:05 - the last week i did one on github pages
08:07 - and that's going to come out this
08:08 - weekend
08:08 - um since i can't live stream tomorrow
08:11 - from my
08:12 - my usual saturday live stream i thought
08:13 - i would open this one up to the
08:15 - community today it's the camera mic
08:23 - is this much louder now all of a sudden
08:24 - me talking showing you my like
08:27 - be like i need to like do some trimming
08:29 - here and get some like shaving things
08:31 - going on
08:32 - is it is it the camera mic oh this mic
08:36 - is it this my oh it's this mic
08:41 - okay hold on uh that is so
08:45 - strange where is this plugged into i
08:47 - don't need this i'm not using this
08:48 - camera i'm gonna unplug this
08:52 - okay
08:54 - i'm going to mute the audio so in case
08:57 - it makes a horrible sound
09:08 - no it's not this mic
09:12 - it's the other camera mic okay
09:18 - so strange
09:22 - oh i know what it is i got it i got it i
09:27 - got it without it i got it
09:29 - yes okay the audio source on obs
09:51 - okay mystery solved now i'm talking into
09:55 - this mic the audio should be better
09:57 - uh this doesn't need to be viewable and
10:01 - also now but why
10:04 - so when the music was playing was the
10:06 - music really sort of like faint and poor
10:08 - quality
10:09 - because it was actually just coming out
10:10 - of my laptop speakers
10:13 - and oh my god
10:16 - um this whole stream might end up
10:18 - getting shut down
10:20 - any moment if like my laptop doesn't
10:22 - work or if something terrible happens
10:24 - yeah it's whoops it's been long enough
10:26 - that a little bit of
10:27 - water is now no long dried from whatever
10:31 - dripped onto the end of this dongle so i
10:33 - think we should be okay
10:44 - okay
10:46 - now audio being quieter is easily
10:49 - fixable
10:50 - because i can just move the volume up
10:51 - now that should be better
10:53 - is this laptop going to come alive oh
10:55 - it's not it's not plugged into power the
11:00 - power did not and you know what i just
11:02 - realized what i should do let me plug in
11:04 - on the other side of the laptop
11:06 - just in case
11:13 - i really need this
11:17 - coffee here much clearer but could be a
11:19 - bit louder okay that's no
11:20 - problem all of that is manageable
11:28 - okay let me uh 9 10 a.m that was
11:31 - very recent so let's let's go into the
11:34 - settings here
11:35 - and we'll make it a little bit louder
11:37 - whoops
11:40 - settings here
11:45 - sensitivity uh this should make it
11:48 - louder
11:52 - no that makes it quieter i think now it
11:54 - should be a little bit louder
11:56 - and even a little bit louder still and
11:59 - there's even a dial here i can turn up
12:04 - so maybe this is better now
12:09 - oh boy okay
12:14 - uh i'm not going to worry about the
12:15 - music right now come back to that
12:18 - uh let's see if
12:21 - uh the laptop is viewable by you there
12:23 - we go
12:24 - we are here oh oh and hold on
12:28 - if you will humor me for again one
12:30 - moment
12:34 - please i will be right back again
12:37 - i'm in a hermetically sealed room but if
12:40 - i leave this room
12:42 - um i must wear my mask and
12:45 - uh which i'm going to do right now
12:49 - i'm going to go into the room next door
12:51 - where my backpack
12:52 - is and get something be right back you
12:55 - can probably still hear me
13:04 - um
13:15 - and now
13:19 - at 9 12 a.m eastern time
13:23 - live from brooklyn new york
13:28 - it is officially the coding train i
13:31 - don't have the belt i managed to
13:32 - remember to throw this train
13:34 - whistle into my backpack this morning so
13:35 - where am i what's going on what's
13:37 - happening
13:38 - um i
13:41 - am uh here at new york university uh
13:44 - where i
13:45 - uh in uh about 100 years ago i used to
13:47 - spend
13:48 - you know at least 75 a large percentage
13:50 - of my waking hours
13:52 - um i work at a program um called itp and
13:55 - ima the statistical of the arts nyu
13:57 - um i have i have been here for the last
13:59 - week um in and out
14:01 - but i hadn't been here since march when
14:04 - uh the covet pandemic really uh reared
14:07 - its head in new york city
14:09 - i've been doing live streaming from home
14:11 - that's my new and actually that's not
14:13 - going away my new
14:14 - system is actually to do side project
14:17 - saturdays
14:18 - um inside project saturdays are a
14:20 - two-hour live stream that happens from
14:22 - home last week i worked on
14:24 - uh programming an arduino inside of
14:26 - simone yetch's
14:28 - everyday calendar you can go back and
14:29 - check that live stream
14:31 - those are typically sponsored so i'll
14:32 - often have a sponsor for those
14:34 - um and will happen from home and are
14:37 - informal and hopefully fun and
14:38 - educational and i have
14:40 - all my equipment there um i use this
14:44 - room to record video tutorials for my
14:46 - nyu courses
14:47 - which i also release to the public on
14:50 - the youtube channel
14:51 - um and those my system for that is i'm
14:53 - not monetizing those and i've
14:55 - i'm trying to clean all this up and get
14:57 - sort of organized but those are
14:59 - video tutorials that hopefully anybody
15:00 - can use and access they're all captioned
15:03 - for your curriculum for your enjoyment
15:05 - um and i even i'm i'm open to
15:08 - offering those outside of youtube for
15:10 - any schools or organizations that can't
15:13 - get the content through the youtube
15:14 - platform so
15:16 - um so that's kind of the deal
15:20 - with my fault that's the sort of new
15:22 - schedule i've adopted
15:25 - and to help um sort of
15:29 - keep me going frankly uh you know
15:32 - moral support financial support all
15:34 - those kinds of things
15:36 - um the membership program which you can
15:37 - sign up directly on youtube with join
15:40 - i bro i broadcast the friday recording
15:42 - sessions to the members as
15:44 - um and that's kind of what i would
15:45 - normally be doing today but
15:47 - with the yom kippur holiday this weekend
15:49 - i'm not available i have some family
15:51 - commitments and i'm not available to
15:52 - live stream on saturday
15:54 - so there will be no live stream tomorrow
15:57 - and instead there is today's
16:00 - members and and i i probably shouldn't
16:02 - like talk about this plan in such detail
16:05 - because every time i ever made a plan it
16:07 - lasted about two weeks
16:08 - and then i ended up just doing something
16:09 - different so we'll see if this care this
16:11 - is what i'm hoping will carry me forward
16:13 - through
16:13 - uh at least until december um uh you
16:15 - know assuming that i have
16:17 - access and safe access to this building
16:19 - it's very empty in here
16:21 - um and i actually am tested uh nyu
16:25 - somebody was telling me is like one of
16:26 - the largest testing providers in the
16:28 - country
16:28 - but uh i just had a test a couple days
16:30 - ago and i had tests two weeks ago
16:31 - they're testing us every two weeks
16:33 - so um i'm just looking at the chat here
16:36 - we've got uh chatanya uh
16:41 - um and and sanjeev tandon who's 13 years
16:43 - old and makes many games from
16:44 - tic-tac-toe sanjeev
16:47 - i i got confused looking at your name
16:48 - because the school here
16:50 - the nyu school of engineering is called
16:52 - the tandon school of engineering
16:53 - and that i got kind of confused all
16:55 - right so just to be clear though
16:57 - all of the content then record to disk
17:00 - i'm not yes thank you
17:01 - all the i don't need to do it yet um all
17:04 - of the content
17:05 - that i record on fridays uh will be
17:08 - released
17:09 - and you will be able to see it even if
17:10 - you're not a member um
17:13 - it just will you'll be able to see it a
17:14 - week later or so depending on how long
17:16 - it takes to kind of get that out all
17:18 - right
17:19 - now i only have till 11 a.m this morning
17:22 - because
17:23 - uh half day the school where my children
17:27 - go
17:27 - in here in brooklyn um has half days on
17:29 - fridays
17:30 - which by the way a half day ends at 11
17:32 - 30 a.m
17:34 - that's not that's like me having my
17:35 - breakfast and checking my email but
17:37 - instead
17:38 - i'm here with you and i've just turned
17:39 - on all my equipment
17:41 - and i'm live streaming but i gotta just
17:43 - jump in
17:44 - i wanted to acknowledge something i want
17:46 - to work with the ml5 library today
17:49 - and i wanted to um
17:53 - acknowledge some of the work that uh in
17:56 - particular
17:56 - several uh processing foundation ml5
17:59 - fellows worked on over the summer
18:01 - and that that unoriginal pun that
18:04 - recorded disk reminder i want it again
18:05 - in just like a few minutes
18:07 - so i don't need to record this part to
18:08 - disk yet although you know what let me
18:10 - start recording to disk so i can double
18:12 - check to make sure the recording is
18:14 - working
18:15 - so um
18:18 - [Music]
18:20 - and i see more messages into the chat
18:22 - you know unfortunately i'm not really
18:24 - i kind of respond and check out the chat
18:26 - randomly so
18:28 - um i appreciate your messages there
18:31 - the best place to engage with the
18:33 - community is the discord i think
18:34 - do i still have that discord button no
18:36 - this is a different
18:38 - i don't have my my just i only have this
18:40 - tiny stream deck that has
18:42 - uh 15 buttons i have the one at home has
18:44 - like 34 or something okay
18:46 - last sorry i'm setting up the record to
18:49 - disk
18:50 - hopefully i'm seeing all my presets and
18:53 - i'm hitting
18:55 - and so now i'm recording to disk i will
18:57 - check those files
18:59 - in a little bit um so unfortunately i
19:02 - don't get your question i would
19:03 - appreciate if you didn't post it
19:04 - multiple times
19:06 - because that kind of makes the chat
19:08 - harder for other people to engage with
19:10 - know that there are some moderators and
19:12 - they'll they can record your question
19:14 - and if you join the discord
19:15 - hopefully somebody can post the link to
19:16 - the discord that's another place to
19:18 - engage with the community and get advice
19:19 - there
19:20 - so um but there's something else i
19:23 - wanted to say
19:24 - that was reminding me i was recording to
19:25 - disk i was looking at that
19:29 - oh well i'll just never mind let me go
19:31 - uh
19:33 - let me go to where i meant to go so i'm
19:35 - going to go to processing foundation
19:36 - medium
19:38 - let's look under fellowships and i
19:41 - wanted to highlight
19:42 - there's a lot of things to highlight
19:44 - here of course but i specifically since
19:46 - i'm going to work with ml5 today i
19:47 - wanted to highlight
19:48 - the work of fellows emily martinez
19:51 - who is working on a project with an ml5
19:54 - community starter kit
19:55 - um i want to look at
19:59 - bomani's work which i definitely have
20:02 - referenced making ml5.js accessible
20:05 - bomani is one of the sort of lead
20:07 - maintainers of the github repos
20:09 - um so check out his amazing work his own
20:12 - artworks as well in addition to his open
20:14 - source work
20:15 - but what was uh um mentioned to me was
20:18 - to highlight was
20:20 - um andreas refsgard work because there's
20:22 - some i'm going to try to create a sort
20:24 - of goofy ml5.js demo today
20:26 - and that's the project that um uh
20:30 - a that andreas worked on over the summer
20:32 - so this is teddy rhymes with steady one
20:35 - of the examples combines image
20:36 - classification
20:37 - from ml5.js with the rhyming algorithm
20:40 - in rita.js
20:41 - that is awesome i got to show this to my
20:43 - class uh
20:45 - so um check out this work i i would love
20:47 - to sort of click through and play with
20:49 - these but i
20:49 - as you know if you've ever watched me
20:51 - before i get really distracted
20:54 - and i ah that's what i was saying about
20:56 - half day friday is only until 11 because
20:57 - i gotta go pick her up
20:59 - um and i i like i have to leave you know
21:02 - when i say 11 like
21:04 - if i'm here until 11 15 i'm like fine
21:06 - but uh 11 is when i need to be wrapping
21:08 - up and starting to say goodbye
21:10 - okay so keep help me that um oh no
21:13 - so we need a video i need to work on my
21:15 - pronunciation of andreas
21:16 - refsgard which is how i always say it
21:18 - which i'm sure is incorrect
21:19 - i'm really working on christian vekman
21:22 - no question question
21:26 - shoot i had it down the other day
21:30 - and then simone yetch i've been like
21:32 - that that one i've been pronouncing
21:33 - simone has a whole video about how to
21:35 - pronounce her name i like by the way
21:36 - that people were like
21:37 - on the internet were like oh it's so
21:40 - great that my two favorite youtubers
21:42 - know each other i'm like well actually
21:43 - we have net in person we did this like
21:44 - brief panel thing at the thinkercon
21:46 - thing but we i mean
21:47 - we're not i mean uh that what i did was
21:49 - just like an unofficial like i'm just
21:50 - playing around with the um
21:53 - uh uh everyday calendar which i which
21:56 - i'm hoping to do more of
21:57 - but i can't do that today because i
21:58 - don't have it with me all right
22:02 - and all right thank you
22:06 - to oh boy a uh a name that is written in
22:09 - cyrillic
22:10 - who is a number one fan thank you for
22:13 - the super chat
22:14 - uh that is very kind of you um and i
22:16 - don't have any of my
22:17 - i don't have my sound board all i have
22:19 - is the train whistle i was able to get
22:20 - that and bring it from home
22:23 - so i'll blow a train whistle for you um
22:26 - but i'm going to move on all right so
22:29 - i think what i need to do here to figure
22:31 - out what i'm going to do
22:33 - is the following um
22:37 - i don't know if i'm logged in on twitter
22:39 - or what nope
22:42 - here we go this is what i'm looking for
22:48 - all right so this is what i'm hoping to
22:50 - build today and
22:52 - i suppose if you would now
22:55 - if you wouldn't mind um just giving me a
22:58 - minute to check that my record to disk
23:00 - is working
23:02 - um and i normally i would actually let's
23:04 - and also
23:05 - why not figure out if i can figure out
23:06 - the sound thing
23:09 - so in theory
23:12 - if i play this
23:15 - you can hear it through this mic and i
23:17 - should be able to
23:19 - pipe it out via loopback
23:23 - [Music]
23:27 - what's this no that's terminal
23:32 - right so this is what i'm doing by the
23:34 - way i'm picking up the audio from the
23:36 - finder
23:37 - and i'm sending it out via the speakers
23:40 - which i could turn off
23:42 - but i'm also sending it to pro capture
23:44 - that's the capture card on the streaming
23:46 - computer
23:49 - so let's turn this off for a second so
23:50 - we know it's not going through
23:52 - my any mic in the room
23:55 - and now i just want to see if i can
23:57 - figure out which input that is in the
23:59 - obs
23:59 - properties for you to hear the music
24:03 - zero i thought it was o2 no
24:07 - oh that's whoops what just happened
24:10 - cancel oh laptop audio sorry that's what
24:13 - i'm doing
24:13 - uh properties um audio
24:16 - one audio two
24:20 - okay that's it now but that's what i had
24:23 - i thought
24:24 - so now you hear the
24:28 - you hear the audio you hear the music
24:29 - correct but if i mute my mic
24:34 - do you still hear me you still hear me
24:36 - it's like combined
24:37 - it's picking up multiple feeds
24:41 - that is crazy all right i i can't deal
24:44 - with this right now we're just not going
24:45 - to worry about it
24:46 - okay i i'm i'm not going to get my
24:49 - laptop audio today
24:50 - and i'm not going to worry about it i
24:51 - don't know why obs is picking up both
24:54 - i guess the capture card it has multiple
24:56 - inputs into it and they're being
24:57 - combined somehow
25:00 - it's just not worth worrying about okay
25:03 - [Music]
25:05 - so let me get everything that i want to
25:07 - do
25:11 - more where's teachable machine here it
25:13 - is
25:18 - digital machine and
25:28 - let me just make sure i want to make
25:30 - sure this code example still works
25:36 - this is a code example that's doing
25:39 - image classes funny
25:40 - i trained it on this train whistle it's
25:41 - a good thing i have it with me today
25:43 - and did i mirror that if i flipped the
25:46 - image
25:46 - no let me just fix that
25:51 - um because that's sort of important
25:55 - for me to do
26:04 - so i'm just getting myself ready
26:08 - ml5
26:11 - [Music]
26:15 - teachable machine image
26:18 - model i think this one has the flip
26:21 - video code in it
26:25 - yep so i need flipped video
26:33 - and then i need
26:38 - flip image
26:47 - there and then
26:52 - whenever i classify i
26:56 - flip the image
26:59 - here's the classify function
27:01 - [Music]
27:04 - and i assume i classify the flipped
27:06 - video
27:07 - and then i can just draw the flipped
27:10 - video also let's see if this works
27:12 - oh shoot
27:18 - um
27:22 - boo
27:30 - preload flipped video oh wait a second
27:34 - no that's the same i mean i could just
27:36 - use this example
27:37 - as my basis why don't i just use this
27:40 - example as my basis
27:45 - because this i'm just going to use this
27:46 - example i don't need my fancier one
27:48 - because i want to code this stuff anyway
27:51 - so let's just use this example to make
27:54 - sure it's working
27:57 - and let's also go here and
28:07 - i think this is how you do css
28:19 - no i don't know
28:22 - there we go okay
28:28 - okay this is working oh great okay
28:32 - and
28:36 - all right everybody record to disk
28:39 - let me check the recording
28:42 - i'm gonna look has it been a half an
28:43 - hour because it makes a new file once
28:45 - it's a half an hour
28:47 - um and what's today's date the 25th
28:51 - uh no i have i started at 9 18. so i'm
28:54 - going to stop the recording and restart
28:56 - it just to check the files i'm going to
28:57 - do that real quick
28:59 - stop multi-corder and then let me look
29:03 - at one of the files just to see
29:05 - if it's stuttering
29:09 - i need to see some place where i'm
29:10 - moving around a lot
29:15 - i see your audio in it and it doesn't
29:17 - look like i'm it's stuttering okay
29:19 - so i think the recording to disc you
29:21 - know i just have to say my recording to
29:22 - disc prayer
29:24 - and um
29:28 - here we go oh did i forget like
29:32 - yeah thank you i guess i need that
29:38 - and all right
29:42 - all right everyone i don't know what the
29:44 - pink artifacts are
29:46 - but
29:49 - i'm hoping what i'm about to do will be
29:52 - accomplishable
29:54 - in about one hour
29:58 - um and oh let me
30:05 - log out log in
30:17 - great still working i am
30:20 - ready to go
30:34 - okay
30:37 - uh i did i start recording again after i
30:41 - checked it
30:42 - yes thank you for asking that question
30:45 - that is the nicest thing anyone's ever
30:47 - done for me
30:50 - worst case uh you know first of all i'm
30:53 - trying one of the things that i really
30:55 - want to avoid doing is the live
30:57 - streaming then re-editing the live
30:59 - stream for a separate upload so that's
31:01 - why i'm kind of separating the friday
31:02 - and saturday
31:03 - but today i'm going back to my old ways
31:06 - but worst case scenario if the record to
31:08 - disk stuff doesn't really work
31:09 - i'm making this project we're doing it
31:11 - it's this live stream will be archived
31:12 - forever
31:13 - i don't necessarily need an edited
31:14 - version that gets released it's a coding
31:16 - challenge
31:17 - but let's see if i can make that happen
31:20 - and
31:21 - here we go
31:24 - pink noise all over the place can
31:26 - somebody in the
31:28 - uh discord chat tell me whether i can
31:31 - ignore these messages that are in the
31:34 - in the main chat um but probably it's
31:37 - like my keying is bad or something
31:39 - okay oh in the search bar oh yeah
31:43 - oh oh yeah why is that so guess what
31:50 - i am not seeing these on my laptop
31:52 - screen
31:53 - i am only seeing them in
31:56 - the output to obs which
32:00 - i can only which i can
32:03 - only surmise is due to the fact that
32:06 - this cable had water spilled on it
32:14 - i don't have another one but i do have a
32:15 - solution which is i can record to disk
32:19 - my um
32:22 - but let's see if unplugging it and
32:25 - plugging it back in fixes the issue
32:33 - that's still there weird hold on
32:38 - i'm looking really close i don't see it
32:40 - on my laptop screen
32:42 - um the sad thing is i could totally
32:47 - record my laptop screen
32:48 - separately but i was going to do
32:51 - something
32:52 - else specifically for recording my
32:54 - laptop screen
32:57 - for the later edited video
33:00 - but let's just because i need to i can't
33:04 - require it's going to use
33:05 - obs i guess i can use quick i can't
33:07 - record my lap it's going to be fun it's
33:08 - going to have to be fine is it
33:11 - always there or is it no it's actually
33:13 - in that doesn't make any sense
33:18 - that's really weird all right
33:21 - i definitely need to ignore this but i i
33:23 - you know
33:24 - i have a problem where like little tiny
33:27 - things
33:29 - drive me crazy um optimize for pro
33:32 - capture standard refresh rate that seems
33:35 - weird why is it
33:37 - why is it 59.88 um
33:43 - definitely don't want to change it to
33:44 - true tone
33:46 - it's funny that true tone got rid of it
33:48 - i think
33:52 - do i have a filter on in obs
33:56 - oh that's possible i have been mucking
33:58 - around with my obs settings
34:01 - let's just quickly oh i know another way
34:04 - i can check this my record to disk
34:07 - has a separate feed of the no it's there
34:12 - it's there in the separate it's not a
34:13 - it's not a filter in obs
34:15 - and it's much more apparent also
34:23 - oh this is driving me crazy
34:27 - everyone's telling me to ignore it but i
34:30 - it's making me crazy i
34:31 - let me have four minutes
34:36 - it's 9 30 eight i have to stop looking
34:39 - into this
34:46 - um
34:51 - oh yeah i was looking for displays
35:05 - that's what it's at 1080p 1080i
35:10 - no
35:14 - whoa much worse right what is going on
35:25 - so strange um
35:35 - what's confusing me is i swear when i
35:37 - just
35:38 - turned on
35:42 - is this like is this
35:51 - did that get rid of it
35:55 - that got rid of it right
36:03 - i don't know why but like
36:06 - there it is it's gone right
36:10 - so for whatever reason this pro capture
36:12 - color profile is doing something weird
36:16 - and then no no it's still there
36:20 - no it's gone
36:28 - did that fix it i can't it's so hard for
36:30 - me to tell
36:34 - it's gone okay just let me believe it's
36:38 - gone that's better anyway
36:40 - uh it's good now okay i'm gonna move on
36:42 - all right 9 30 oh i i took two more
36:44 - minutes
36:45 - i gave myself two more minutes
36:51 - sd-170ma was better
36:53 - i don't believe you
37:03 - is that better
37:10 - all right let me double check to make
37:12 - sure there's no filter in obs but i'm
37:15 - kind of
37:18 - that's me that's the audio
37:22 - that's the laptop filters
37:26 - no filters on
37:47 - sd 170 whatever is better okay so i'm
37:50 - going to use that
37:52 - and hopefully this will be fine i'm just
37:54 - going to look at it in my record to disk
37:56 - software
37:57 - it's still like there faintly but
38:00 - whatever
38:02 - gotta move on
38:06 - gotta move on to two
38:20 - all right
38:31 - i'm gonna be using the whiteboard today
38:33 - people okay
38:34 - faintly there all right
38:38 - hi everyone no that's not a good way to
38:40 - start
38:45 - restart i don't think it's chrome i
38:47 - really don't think it's the chrome
38:48 - browser
38:53 - welcome to a coding challenge
38:58 - let's get ready to coding challenge
39:05 - 9 38 all right 9 38 here we go
39:09 - hello everyone and welcome to a coding
39:11 - challenge the first one since
39:12 - march of 2020 and what i am going to
39:15 - attempt to do today
39:16 - is make my own version of this project
39:19 - this is not my idea
39:20 - uh this came across my twitter desk the
39:23 - other day from cameron hunter
39:25 - who created a video lens that uses hand
39:28 - gestures to show comic book style
39:30 - messages instead
39:31 - in a video called you know i don't know
39:34 - if you noticed
39:35 - in this year of 2020 lots of stuff is
39:37 - happening
39:39 - but many of us including myself are
39:41 - spending a large amount of time in video
39:43 - calls
39:44 - and i want to see if i can figure out a
39:46 - way using the tools of
39:48 - p5.js ml5.js teachable machine
39:51 - and open broadcast studio and zoom as
39:54 - the video conference
39:56 - software of choice not sponsor you could
39:58 - use anyone that you want
40:00 - but i'm going to attempt to use zoom and
40:01 - see if i can create my own overlays
40:03 - that are controlled with my own gestures
40:05 - that's what's going to happen today i
40:06 - have not attempted this
40:07 - at any point in the past present or
40:10 - future
40:11 - so here we go
40:20 - so to be honest there's not going to be
40:22 - a tremendous amount of coding in this
40:24 - particular
40:25 - video there will be however a lot of
40:28 - like piecing together a lot of different
40:30 - parts of tools and software and things
40:32 - like that and
40:33 - i'm doing the thing where i'm allowing
40:34 - myself to to do stuff again which i
40:37 - shouldn't do because probably my
40:38 - recorded disc is failing and this is
40:39 - just to just be a thing that i'm making
40:41 - and there's not really going to be any
40:42 - editing i should put a timer on and give
40:44 - myself a certain amount of time i should
40:45 - just go for it
40:56 - to be honest there's probably not going
40:57 - to be a ton of coding in this although i
40:59 - will be writing code
41:01 - and mostly i'm going to be like plugging
41:03 - in this piece of software to this piece
41:04 - of software and this piece of software
41:06 - lots of connectors and tubes and cables
41:08 - and things but all
41:09 - um happening on the computer because i'm
41:10 - much too afraid to use that stuff in
41:12 - real physical life
41:13 - okay so let me talk through what the
41:15 - components are
41:17 - so what i'm going to have ultimately is
41:21 - a video feed where for example when i
41:23 - raise my hand and apparently i can't
41:25 - draw that's me raising my hand
41:27 - i might have a pop-up that says you know
41:29 - question
41:30 - a big pop-up so that the other people in
41:32 - the room can see that i'm raising my
41:34 - hand and i have a question
41:35 - so this is what i want so how am i going
41:36 - to get there so to do this
41:38 - i'm going to use a p5.js to connect to
41:41 - my camera
41:42 - and show my camera feed then i'm going
41:45 - to use
41:45 - a teachable machine to train a machine
41:48 - learning model
41:51 - to recognize my particular gestures so
41:53 - just as point out if you're
41:55 - you should be able to do this yourself
41:56 - at the end of this video and you won't
41:58 - even have to write any of your own code
41:59 - you could reuse my code
42:01 - but almost certainly well definitely you
42:03 - will need to train your own model
42:05 - so i'll talk about how to do that which
42:06 - you don't need to do any coding for
42:09 - machine learning model so once i have
42:11 - that and then
42:12 - i'm going to talk to the teachable
42:13 - machine model with ml5.js
42:16 - so all of these components will be
42:18 - running in
42:19 - a web browser
42:23 - this is all inside the web browser then
42:26 - i'm going to use a piece of software
42:28 - called obs
42:30 - or open broadcast studio it is the
42:33 - software i'm using right now to live
42:35 - stream
42:35 - to record to disk it is software that i
42:38 - use for
42:39 - making youtube videos but what i can do
42:41 - with obs one of the things i can do
42:43 - is i can capture everything that's in
42:46 - the browser
42:47 - so the browser is going to be sent into
42:49 - obs and then
42:50 - this picture blues diagram is terrible
42:53 - you will see
42:54 - in obs then from obs
42:57 - i'm going to start something called a
42:59 - virtual camera
43:02 - so i'm going to trick the computer into
43:06 - thinking
43:06 - that the open broadcast studio software
43:09 - is my webcam
43:10 - so when i log into a zoom meeting
43:15 - and there is a grid of people and this
43:18 - is me
43:18 - here i will select the obs
43:23 - virtual cam as my video input
43:26 - so instead of picking the default you
43:28 - know if i'm on a mac it's going to say
43:29 - like facetime camera i'm going to switch
43:30 - to
43:31 - obs virtual camera this is not the only
43:33 - way to do this
43:35 - as you can see uh in the project i
43:37 - reference where i got this idea from
43:39 - it's using something like snap lens
43:41 - studio something i'm sure there are
43:43 - countless other ways you could approach
43:44 - this but i never really thought this
43:46 - diagram was going to be helpful
43:47 - hopefully it's at least it's helping me
43:49 - sort of think through this
43:50 - um i i'm hoping this is going to work
43:53 - again i haven't tried this yet so
43:55 - remains to be seen
44:11 - all right let's do the first part train
44:14 - the model
44:15 - so i'm going to go to the teachable
44:16 - machine website now i could
44:18 - really if i wanted to just talk for the
44:21 - next like hour
44:22 - about what teachable machine is uh
44:24 - fortunately i'm not gonna do that and if
44:25 - you want to learn more about teachable
44:27 - machine i have three videos that i've
44:29 - already made
44:30 - about how to train a model and use it
44:31 - with p5 and you can do stuff with audio
44:33 - there's lots of stuff there
44:34 - google has a lot of resources it's a
44:36 - it's made by folks at the google
44:37 - creative lab
44:38 - um i'll include a lot of references in
44:40 - the video subscription of course to
44:42 - teachable machine
44:43 - i'm just going to click on to get
44:44 - started i want to do an image project
44:46 - because i want to train a model from my
44:48 - on me and i'm going to first create the
44:51 - first i'm just going to do
44:53 - i'm going to do like back i'm going to
44:54 - do background i'm going to call
44:57 - background being like me not doing
44:58 - anything just me just kind of sitting in
45:00 - the meeting like this
45:03 - trying to make eye contact with people
45:04 - over a computer through a web have you
45:06 - ever tried it doesn't work
45:08 - how do you make the eye contact
45:11 - where do i look i got to just look at
45:12 - myself which is weird
45:14 - but it's like that's what my eye is
45:15 - drawn to is that like that for you or is
45:17 - it just me am i weird
45:18 - i think i'm weird it's definitely weird
45:20 - and then the next uh category will be
45:22 - question
45:22 - so i want to click webcam and um
45:27 - you can see i've already installed by
45:28 - the way virt obs virtual camera on this
45:30 - computer so you can see this is like
45:32 - it's already available but that's not
45:33 - what i want right now
45:34 - i want the facetime camera and i just
45:36 - want to like record myself here
45:39 - what do i do in a meeting
45:46 - no i don't don't make any gestures okay
45:49 - so that's probably good enough
45:51 - and then i want to do the question
45:54 - um the question now will i what hand do
45:57 - i raise
45:59 - i have a question it's confusing because
46:00 - i want to i need to use my mouse
46:02 - i guess i'm going to be left-handed for
46:03 - asking my questions
46:10 - i'm going to try to get about the same
46:12 - amount of samples like 238
46:18 - okay and i'm going to train this model
46:22 - i get to take a little break here
46:30 - remember the don't switch tabs song
46:33 - i don't i don't know in my ukulele but i
46:36 - had it don't switch the tabs don't
46:38 - switch the tabs
46:42 - oh it trained okay so let's see if it's
46:44 - working background
46:47 - question background
46:50 - question so this is perfect so now i
46:52 - have a model trained
46:53 - it's very important i mean even though i
46:55 - talk about all this in the teachable
46:56 - machine videos
46:57 - and i'm trying not to do this now it's
46:59 - important for me to emphasize this is
47:01 - not doing any kind of gesture
47:02 - recognition
47:03 - this is pure image classification so
47:06 - it's not going to work if i gave this
47:08 - model to you and you're wearing a
47:09 - different shirt you have different hair
47:10 - you're not wearing glasses your
47:12 - background is different
47:13 - um so this is the kind of thing that
47:15 - every person would have to customize
47:16 - which i think is nice because you can
47:17 - make up your own gestures and different
47:19 - things and everybody moves in different
47:20 - ways
47:20 - and does different types of things gotta
47:23 - move on
47:25 - that's the song that's stuck in my head
47:27 - today uh
47:29 - all right so now export model and
47:32 - certainly i could download the model
47:34 - all this could be done locally without
47:35 - anything being anywhere in the cloud
47:38 - all of those images were not sent
47:40 - anywhere into the cloud you can
47:41 - with teachable machines save them the
47:42 - google drive but i do want to upload the
47:44 - model it's just going to make it very
47:45 - convenient for me to work with
47:46 - so i'm going to upload the model
47:53 - now i have the url right here which i'm
47:55 - going to click
47:56 - copy then i'm going to go over to
48:00 - the ml5 code example so let's call this
48:03 - [Music]
48:04 - zoom zoom annotations
48:07 - i don't know if that makes sense let's
48:09 - get rid of this
48:11 - just want to simplify this example it
48:13 - actually has some
48:14 - extra stuff in it that i don't need and
48:17 - let's run it
48:18 - so this is the example that comes with
48:20 - ml5
48:21 - and it's just actually it's a
48:22 - pre-trained model that is showing
48:24 - that has two categories daytime or
48:28 - night time so it's hard to make a model
48:30 - that people can universally test and use
48:33 - but this is one and now so now in theory
48:36 - if i were to go and paste the url
48:38 - remember where did i get that from
48:40 - right from here this shareable link of
48:44 - the model
48:45 - by the way you could go there right now
48:46 - and try it i don't know if anybody can
48:48 - manage to like get it into the chat
48:50 - who's watching right now
48:52 - i'm going to paste it in here my font is
48:55 - very small
49:09 - i've pasted it in and i'm going to run
49:11 - the example again
49:16 - what
49:19 - oh there's a mistake here ah okay so
49:22 - this this will hopefully be fixed by the
49:24 - time you watch this video
49:25 - i actually updated the examples it needs
49:27 - to also have uh
49:28 - added the to the end of the url i need
49:31 - to add plus model.json that's what ml5
49:33 - is looking for that particular json file
49:35 - that holds the information about the
49:36 - model
49:40 - background question background
49:44 - question all right let's get
49:47 - at least a quick pop-up of a question
49:49 - mark to appear
49:51 - when i say i have a question
49:56 - i have an insane amount of all right
50:06 - okay um
50:16 - before i do that let me make a couple
50:18 - quick changes i want to just
50:20 - um make this a little bit bigger
50:23 - uh and then i want the uh
50:28 - i'm always going to have the video size
50:30 - match
50:31 - um the canvas size and then i actually
50:34 - don't want to draw the text label that's
50:36 - not something i'm doing
50:37 - um so let me just make sure this works
50:39 - still and we see it a little bit bigger
50:42 - so i should be able to say now if
50:45 - label equals question
50:48 - draw something else and i happen to have
50:50 - a thank you to jason heglund
50:52 - who is the coding trained illustrator
50:53 - makes all the characters
50:55 - um i think i have one of these that i
50:58 - can use
51:00 - let's try using this one so i should be
51:03 - able to
51:06 - upload a file
51:12 - and drag it here it's kind of like a
51:14 - weird name
51:15 - let me just rename this i'm just going
51:18 - to call it uh
51:20 - question.png
51:23 - and then in the sketch i want to say
51:28 - question and i'll preload that image
51:31 - question
51:35 - preload a question.png
51:41 - then let us try to say image
51:44 - question zero zero so i'm not really
51:47 - being thoughtful about this let's just
51:48 - see if it appears
51:53 - whoops what happened what
51:58 - preload no the function name is load
52:01 - image this is me trying to do stuff way
52:02 - too quickly making weird mistakes
52:05 - also my computer feels like it's dying
52:06 - here
52:12 - save i think this page froze
52:22 - ah
52:27 - let's try this again
52:45 - let's see if i can at least get
52:46 - something to appear
52:56 - okay come on people
53:06 - debugging time
53:10 - oh guess what folks
53:14 - i named my labels with a capital q
53:18 - capital first letter
53:21 - okay and by the way i really should uh
53:23 - check and see like what is
53:25 - the resolution of this image it is
53:29 - that's a little bit unnecessary for me
53:32 - right now
53:32 - let's fix that um
53:37 - let's just put this on the desktop we'll
53:39 - call this uh
53:42 - question dot png i want it to be like
53:45 - the character sitting on the bottom
53:47 - so let me adjust the size to
53:54 - 480
53:57 - better then
54:01 - i'll re-upload it
54:16 - better okay here we go again
54:32 - so one thing i really want to do which i
54:33 - feel like is important here is to kind
54:35 - of debounce this a little bit
54:37 - so i feel like if it's going to appear i
54:39 - don't want it to
54:41 - uh disappear immediately like i don't
54:43 - want it to flicker
54:44 - so i'm just going to always have it fade
54:46 - out
54:48 - so let me just i think i can use i mean
54:50 - i should make like an
54:51 - object there's all sorts of ways i could
54:52 - engineer this in a really thoughtful way
54:55 - but i am going to just do a i'm going to
54:58 - make a variable called
54:59 - fade out and set it
55:03 - equal to 255 and then whenever i detect
55:07 - a particular label
55:08 - i'll say fade out equals 255
55:12 - and then
55:18 - and let me put
55:22 - this i'm just bear with me i'm gonna
55:24 - have to think about how to do this with
55:25 - multiple things
55:26 - but let me just get this to work right
55:27 - now fade out
55:29 - minus equals five let's make minus equal
55:31 - to ten
55:32 - um if fade out is less than zero
55:37 - i'll say fade out is greater than zero
55:39 - image
55:40 - question so and actually fade out should
55:43 - be
55:44 - zero so you know what this is this is
55:46 - why i need to like wrap these two things
55:47 - together
55:48 - into like an object or something but
55:50 - let's just have question fade
55:52 - be at zero and what i'm really doing is
55:54 - i'm setting question
55:55 - fade to 255 whenever i get that label
55:59 - and then i'm always fading it out and
56:01 - i'm only drawing it if i have
56:03 - a value greater than zero and
56:07 - just for efficiency's sake i'll also
56:09 - just fade it out when it's greater than
56:10 - zero so this should now
56:13 - um it should always it shouldn't like
56:14 - flicker like
56:16 - uh
56:20 - i didn't oh i i have to sorry i
56:23 - that's actually like just leaving it
56:24 - there it's actually going to fade it so
56:26 - i was going to say
56:27 - tint question fade
56:30 - which i i realized it actually is i
56:32 - debounced it just by
56:34 - not even having it fade but
56:37 - oh hello that tint applies to everything
56:49 - whoa that was weird
56:53 - i don't know why it is uh
56:56 - that's the way the image fades maybe
56:59 - somebody can
56:59 - can investigate that is that like a bug
57:02 - in p5
57:03 - or is that actually how it's supposed to
57:06 - work
57:08 - do i need to do like oh maybe i need to
57:11 - do this
57:12 - so i'm definitely fading oh i'm just
57:14 - fading the brightness
57:17 - there we go that's what i was looking to
57:18 - do so that's
57:20 - i was i want the brightness to always be
57:22 - at 255 but i want to fade the alpha
57:24 - okay so now let's see if we can get this
57:27 - into a zoom meeting now obviously of
57:29 - course
57:30 - we could spend hours making like little
57:32 - animations and training different
57:33 - gestures and after i get it all working
57:35 - i want to spend a little time making a
57:37 - version of this with with some
57:38 - animations and different things
57:40 - but i just want to see if i can at least
57:41 - get this into a zoom meeting
57:44 - so the first thing i need to do is open
57:45 - up open broadcast studio
57:55 - so this is the website for obs studio
57:57 - it's open source it's free there are
57:59 - some like other companies who have made
58:01 - their own versions of obs that are maybe
58:02 - paid
58:03 - and different things but this is the one
58:05 - that i use i just use the free open
58:07 - source open broadcaster
58:08 - studio i guess it's broadcaster software
58:11 - who knows oh it's open broadcaster
58:13 - software studio
58:15 - i guess that is the correct way to say
58:17 - it um
58:18 - and um so i already have that on my
58:20 - computer i'm going to
58:22 - open it up when you open it up it should
58:26 - look blank
58:27 - just like this it's an empty window and
58:29 - i have been actually hoping to make some
58:32 - obs tutorials
58:33 - and i've just never gotten around to it
58:35 - so this that's not what this is going to
58:36 - be i'm just going to quickly show you
58:38 - a few steps to get this working
58:41 - but at some point i will maybe also
58:45 - create some tutorials for it all right
58:47 - so i have a scene
58:49 - that's what's down here i can make
58:51 - multiple scenes but i just want to use
58:52 - the default scene now i need a source
58:55 - so normally what i might do and just is
58:57 - i might say something like video capture
58:59 - device
59:01 - but i'm going to
59:04 - i'm thinking about this
59:10 - um ultimately what i probably want to do
59:13 - and i'll see if i can get this working
59:14 - later
59:15 - is select a video capture device
59:18 - i'm going to call this a webcam and i'm
59:21 - going to
59:23 - pick my webcam
59:26 - and have that be the sort of main
59:28 - element of
59:29 - the scene and then the other stuff would
59:32 - be an overlay over it
59:33 - which i think i have an idea of how to
59:35 - do but right now i'm just going to try
59:36 - to get the raw browser
59:38 - window into into this so it won't be
59:42 - pixel perfect in terms of resolution and
59:43 - everything
59:44 - but it'll be a start so let me
59:48 - i'm gonna i'm gonna take that out and
59:51 - delete it
59:54 - and i'm going to say is it window
59:57 - capture display capture i think it's
59:59 - window capture
60:01 - and i want to capture a
60:04 - p5 web editor
60:09 - and i think the best way for me to do
60:11 - this
60:13 - is to go to
60:16 - share and take the
60:19 - let's take the present mode
60:23 - and open a new
60:26 - window paste it in there
60:33 - i can even make it a little bigger just
60:34 - by zooming in let's make sure this is
60:36 - working
60:38 - oh did i not hit save shoot
60:41 - let me hit save and go back to this
60:44 - window
60:49 - and actually i just want to like do this
60:51 - because
60:52 - let's see if it's working great okay so
60:55 - now
60:56 - uh in obs i want to
60:59 - take
61:02 - chrome
61:08 - how come i don't see it here shouldn't i
61:11 - see
61:11 - one that says chrome like i don't want
61:15 - this
61:20 - oh there it is i don't know why i didn't
61:21 - see it before i want to take the one
61:23 - that says google chrome
61:24 - webcam image classification so i want to
61:26 - take that
61:29 - then i'm going to say ok then i'm going
61:31 - to use the option key
61:33 - to like just crop around the part that i
61:35 - want again this is silly there are some
61:37 - better ways that i could do this
61:39 - probably but i'm just going to crop
61:41 - around the part that i want
61:43 - and then i will stretch it out
61:46 - and it's the wrong aspect ratio so maybe
61:49 - i'll just like
61:50 - no how do i do this i'll just crop out
61:53 - some of the bottom i don't know let's
61:54 - just leave it like this
61:55 - we're going to work on the layout later
61:57 - and now i've got it
61:59 - in obs and whenever i raise my hand
62:03 - it's happening you can see the frame
62:05 - rate is really low i'm going to work on
62:07 - a way to
62:08 - fix this
62:15 - yeah um
62:20 - i'm going to see if that works
62:24 - i just didn't want to try that first
62:25 - there's some good suggestions in the
62:26 - chat about
62:27 - capturing the browser directly in obs
62:30 - but let's just leave this
62:31 - now the next thing that i want to do is
62:34 - start the obs virtual camera
62:38 - so that is an option i have right here
62:41 - under tools
62:42 - start virtual camera
62:48 - that is an option i have over here under
62:50 - tools i'm saying this again
62:52 - actually that's an option i have over
62:54 - here under tools start virtual camera
62:58 - the re that does not come by default
63:00 - with obs
63:01 - studio
63:18 - hopefully this is the one that i'm using
63:19 - but um
63:22 - so on the obs project forum there's a
63:24 - post called
63:25 - obs virtual camera 2.0.5
63:29 - and this is what you can follow these
63:31 - instructions to
63:32 - install the virtual camera and i believe
63:36 - oh it definitely supports mac because i
63:38 - have it for mac is it a different one
63:40 - for mac let's just see
63:45 - yeah so um this one is actually the one
63:49 - for whoops
63:54 - this one is actually the one for windows
63:56 - so if you're on windows you can just run
63:58 - this particular installer that you can
63:59 - download from github
64:08 - let's see if we can find the mac one
64:25 - oh yeah and um
64:34 - and for mac there's this particular obs
64:38 - virtual cam that you can just download
64:40 - and run the installer right here and
64:41 - i'll include links to both of these for
64:43 - mac
64:44 - and windows in the video's description
64:46 - and somebody in the chat telling me
64:47 - there's a way to use v4l
64:48 - to sync on linux so i'll try to include
64:51 - some information for that as well
65:02 - so i'm going to do oh i already so i've
65:06 - started the virtual camera and now i
65:07 - need to go into a zoom meeting
65:10 - so time out for a second i'm going to
65:12 - use uh
65:13 - a link that i know that opens a test
65:15 - meeting
65:16 - it might be that this is exposed to
65:19 - those of you watching in which case
65:22 - uh i would ask you not to join the
65:24 - meeting or at least i'll try to like
65:27 - but if you do you're not you're not
65:29 - helping anybody you're just making this
65:31 - experience it's worse for me and
65:32 - everybody else
65:34 - so hopefully that won't happen um okay
65:37 - so i'm going to go um because i have a
65:40 - zoom account through nyu
65:41 - i'm going to nyu.zoom dot us slash test
65:45 - and this should open up a test meeting
65:56 - let's go into the meeting
66:01 - and i'm going to say join without video
66:03 - just for the moment
66:08 - yeah yeah yeah i think you're working
66:17 - okay so normally if i start my video um
66:21 - this is just me in the zoom meeting
66:24 - uh with this uh the video that's the
66:28 - webcam and now i should be able to go
66:29 - over here
66:30 - and change to obs virtual camera i
66:33 - forgot
66:34 - that i opened it up here
66:37 - and there we go here we go i'm in the
66:40 - zoom meeting
66:42 - hi everybody oh oh this is such a great
66:45 - discussion glass thingy
66:50 - me oh it's reversed oh you know what it
66:54 - is
66:54 - i think zoom is just showing it reversed
66:56 - for me
67:01 - right is um let's go into video settings
67:06 - oh because i've already flipped it oh
67:14 - yeah so when does anybody know this
67:17 - mirror my video oh touch up my
67:20 - appearance i definitely want to do that
67:22 - um does this mirror my video only mirror
67:25 - it for you to see yourself mirrored or
67:26 - does it actually mirror it for other
67:28 - people
67:35 - i don't know i don't know if anybody
67:36 - knows
67:38 - so because it's flipped because zoom is
67:40 - trying to make it a nice experience for
67:41 - me i'm going to uncheck this mirror my
67:43 - video
67:44 - and i've already mirrored it in my own
67:46 - software and now
67:49 - i have a question
68:08 - um
68:11 - all right um so i want to think about
68:15 - ways to improve this
68:23 - which i have some ideas about
68:36 - i'm told the pink noise is back it's so
68:38 - minor though
68:39 - no big deal all right um
68:43 - let's close out of the meeting
68:47 - let's close this page
68:50 - let's disable this in obs
69:01 - yeah um
69:06 - all right the first thing i want to do
69:08 - is i want to try and see
69:09 - what happens so i've got lots of stuff
69:12 - open by the way so
69:14 - let's turn this off
69:18 - um
69:24 - this is stopped
69:40 - okay first things first
69:44 - let's see what happens
69:55 - the first thing i want to try is let's
69:57 - see how the built-in browser to obs
70:00 - works i am going to
70:03 - do um a
70:06 - browser source i'm going to paste in the
70:08 - link to my
70:09 - p5 sketch i kind of have a feeling i'm
70:11 - going to there's going to be a problem
70:12 - here and i have a way around it
70:14 - i'm going to hit ok
70:18 - i've added a browser source i want this
70:20 - particular url oh i put that in the
70:22 - title for it
70:25 - i don't know that i care about this css
70:26 - but i'll leave it
70:28 - with let's leave it at 800 by 600 right
70:32 - now
70:33 - and let's say okay
70:41 - now the reason why i think it's not
70:42 - working is it doesn't have permission
70:45 - to open the camera the built-in browser
70:48 - to obs
70:49 - probably doesn't have permission so i
70:50 - have a way around this
70:52 - i anticipated this issue
70:58 - let's download the code
71:04 - put it on the desktop
71:10 - call it zoom let's open up
71:13 - terminal
71:19 - let's run a web server so i think
71:25 - oh even for localhost i thought the
71:27 - browser doesn't ask permission for a
71:29 - localhost
71:32 - so this is working i thought now i could
71:34 - put
71:35 - maybe if i say localhost it won't
71:38 - no it still asks permission um
71:43 - let's see if this works this is
71:46 - unfortunate
71:49 - we'll have to sneeze
72:06 - uh
72:10 - local host
72:14 - control audio no use custom frame right
72:17 - now
72:18 - so anything i can do here
72:27 - does anyone know whether obs has like a
72:30 - console or anything i can do enable
72:32 - media stream
72:36 - you need to run obs with a flag to
72:38 - automatically give permission
72:42 - that's very interesting how would i
72:43 - possibly do that
72:57 - obs executable dash dash
73:00 - enable me okay
73:04 - all right so i'm making this
73:06 - unfortunately additionally complicated
73:10 - but let's quit obs
73:15 - go to uh terminal
73:20 - oh whoops let's actually keep this
73:22 - running
73:23 - so where do i want to go
73:29 - go to applications and then
73:37 - oh maybe it's hold on
73:46 - yeah obs app
73:54 - this is what i would do on a mac
74:01 - oh i mean you oh i'm in okay
74:08 - right that runs it but can i put those
74:11 - arguments
74:12 - here
74:16 - or do i can i do this
74:21 - no that was weird
74:24 - or do
74:28 - is it in the contents like
74:37 - the actual oh no no i want the folder
74:43 - i think i can do like show package
74:46 - contents contents
74:52 - it must be this right this must be the
74:54 - executable
74:56 - contents mac os
75:08 - whoa
75:16 - oh what
75:39 - oh okay
75:45 - let's try this enable
75:53 - media stream um
75:58 - remote debugging port
76:04 - equals nine two two two
76:07 - to get debugging in a browser okay let's
76:09 - try this
76:12 - no
76:19 - reads input from note
76:23 - field arcs args dash dash arcs
76:28 - this is not what i expected to be doing
76:31 - i think i can do this
76:36 - there we go so now
76:40 - a browser a localhost
76:46 - oh whoops local host
76:50 - local host
76:58 - ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding
77:00 - the only unfortunate thing
77:02 - is it went and got my obs virtual camera
77:07 - not the actual facetime camera
77:11 - but that worked so how do i tell it now
77:18 - i have to write something in the code to
77:19 - select the right camera or i have to
77:21 - change the default camera of the obs
77:23 - browser oh this is so sad
77:27 - oh that's such a pain i have another
77:30 - idea for how to do this that i think
77:31 - will probably be just fine
77:33 - but i would prefer to really get this
77:34 - working working
77:37 - um
77:41 - how do i change so let's do
77:46 - p5.js enumerate cameras i've seen this
77:50 - select cameras um
77:58 - so console log devices
78:02 - object object object virtual camera
78:06 - facetime camera okay
78:08 - so uh this should work
78:14 - hey all right okay so let me take this
78:19 - and
78:24 - hold on i have this open already so now
78:27 - i'm going to
78:29 - set the default camera i'm going to work
78:31 - from localhost i think from now on
78:34 - and i want to set the default camera so
78:37 - where do i let's just paste this all in
78:38 - and see what i need
78:41 - setup i need to do enumerate devices
78:49 - in setup
78:54 - then i need the got devices function
78:59 - i don't really think that i necessarily
79:01 - need this array but i'll just keep it
79:05 - so let's put that here just so i can
79:07 - find it and then i want to set devices 1
79:12 - and
79:16 - create capture with the video so then i
79:20 - should be able to
79:27 - i should be able to change this to
79:30 - video equals create capture
79:33 - set the size hide it
79:36 - and do all this stuff here once i've
79:40 - selected
79:41 - the correct camera oh i'm i'm really off
79:44 - the rails now with this
79:45 - very simple example that i made
79:49 - um okay
79:53 - how we doing here i think i'm in pretty
79:55 - good shape
79:58 - this needs to go this needs to go
80:08 - let's take a look at localhost
80:14 - okay that's working here
80:19 - now we should be able to actually
80:21 - actually just be able to refresh this
80:24 - i think will this refresh it
80:28 - no um
80:36 - do i really have to like remove it
80:43 - add the browser again oh wait it's not
80:45 - there still
80:47 - i thought it would be underexisting
80:57 - come on did i not say did i oh i didn't
81:00 - restart the server yeah i did
81:01 - is it caching it oh
81:06 - wait no there's no server running
81:10 - that was weird
81:14 - let's try this
81:18 - i mean i can also just go back to the
81:21 - browser now oh this is crazy what i'm
81:23 - doing why am i taking all this time to
81:24 - do this
81:28 - hold on let's just be really sure about
81:30 - this by uh
81:31 - also making a different port let me use
81:34 - whoops
81:39 - is it like this okay i'm running it on a
81:42 - different port
81:43 - just to be a hundred percent sure let me
81:46 - make sure this works here
81:54 - oh weird i actually didn't test this
81:58 - code
81:59 - it's doing something weird now what did
82:00 - i do wrong i think i i must not have
82:02 - saved it
82:04 - okay video create capture
82:07 - with height size
82:12 - oh i have this too sorry this has to go
82:36 - so
82:43 - uh we've got an error where
82:47 - oh because
82:58 - i gotta wait until flipped video is
83:00 - actually available
83:09 - i think by the way i i'm missing an
83:12 - important
83:12 - setting here
83:23 - i don't realize i didn't have that set
83:25 - here
83:28 - okay there we go okay now localhost
83:33 - 8081 is working
83:36 - now i should be able to go back to obs
83:39 - this probably isn't going to be any
83:41 - faster frame rate rise i just want to i
83:42 - i
83:43 - because there's something i can do here
83:44 - which is really awesome just give me a
83:46 - second i'm getting there
83:48 - localhost and
83:52 - put this in there hit ok
83:59 - there we go wow i think the built-in obs
84:03 - browser is like really bad
84:08 - this is worse
84:14 - because i forgot that this whole sketch
84:16 - is operating with like webgl
84:18 - i mentioned there's no like webgl opengl
84:20 - context
84:22 - uh the best thing for me to do would
84:23 - actually be use like uh
84:25 - websockets or something and run a server
84:27 - but
84:28 - i have this idea went nowhere so this
84:31 - will get edited out
84:33 - all right and if if this gets edited
84:35 - into the coding challenge i'll i'll
84:36 - explain
84:37 - so um in case i this all by recorded
84:41 - this is actually
84:42 - called it 25 minutes ago so it's chris
84:45 - manning
84:46 - sorry about that um
84:50 - i'm going to act as if my recorded disc
84:52 - is working and we're actually going to
84:53 - edit this into something
84:54 - so i just tried to see if i could get
84:57 - this to perform better
84:59 - by running opening an actual browser
85:02 - source within open broadcast studio
85:04 - itself
85:04 - and i had to jump through some hoops to
85:06 - like enable the video capture and all
85:08 - this stuff
85:09 - but it's actually much much worse and i
85:11 - believe this is because teachable
85:12 - machine runs in the opengl com with the
85:14 - opengl context
85:16 - using web i believe this is because
85:21 - i believe this is because a teachable
85:23 - machine
85:24 - runs using the webgl context to do the
85:26 - to run the machine learning model
85:28 - and that probably is not something that
85:29 - performs well in open broadcast studio
85:32 - but it is i say i have a better idea
85:34 - better than all of my ideas here it
85:38 - comes
85:52 - okay
85:59 - i'm thinking about this
86:09 - i mean what i really want to do is run
86:13 - i'm going to do it the way i'm just
86:14 - going to do it the simplest way i can
86:15 - think of
86:22 - it okay
86:25 - this is what i'm going to do i'm going
86:27 - to make a
86:30 - uh what's 16 by 9 like 1280 by 720. i'm
86:34 - going to make a 1280
86:36 - by 720 canvas
86:39 - i'm going to make the video as small as
86:41 - possible
86:42 - so let's see even if i do it like 160 by
86:45 - 120
86:46 - and i'm going to hide it i'm not going
86:49 - to hide it i want to see that video
86:51 - separately
86:53 - and then i don't want to draw the video
86:58 - instead i just want to see the image pop
87:01 - up so let's see if this works
87:08 - so i've got my video at the bottom right
87:14 - and i'm able to get
87:18 - the question mark to pop up great
87:22 - so now i'm going to go to the
87:29 - present view again
87:40 - my i moved the camera around which i
87:42 - think is causing a bit of a problem
87:44 - i'm going to have to retrain the model
87:45 - which i'll do let me go back to here
87:47 - this is working pretty well
87:49 - and i want to change the background to
87:51 - [Music]
87:53 - a pure green actually i could just make
87:56 - a trans no i'm going to do a pure green
88:01 - and you'll see why in a second
88:04 - so stop
88:13 - did i not hit save
88:18 - now this should run much faster because
88:20 - i am passing
88:22 - a very small video to the machine
88:25 - learning model i don't need a high
88:27 - resolution video to do the
88:28 - classification
88:30 - and i'm also not drawing it so it's much
88:32 - less work for me not to actually draw
88:34 - the video just draw this
88:35 - because now what i can do in open
88:37 - broadcast studio
88:40 - which i can open again
88:44 - and let me delete these other elements
88:50 - i can actually just add my camera source
88:54 - directly
88:58 - so i want to add the facetime camera
89:03 - i'm going to add it here i'm going to
89:05 - stretch it out to take up the full
89:07 - and you can see the frame rate is very
89:09 - fluid here
89:10 - then i'm going to add as another scene
89:14 - a window capture and i'm going to
89:18 - get the browser i don't know why i'm
89:20 - always making a new one but that's fine
89:23 - and i want to get
89:32 - i want to grab this which is here
89:35 - hit ok i'm going to stretch this out
89:38 - but i'm going to crop it around the
89:50 - canvas
89:52 - i'm going to fill the window basically
89:55 - with it
89:56 - then i'm going to add a filter in obs
90:00 - i'm going to go to filters
90:02 - i'm going to add an effect filter i'm
90:04 - going to go to chroma key
90:08 - and i want to chroma key the green out
90:12 - so i'm going to say the default's going
90:14 - to work really well i have a perfect
90:15 - chroma key because i drew the green
90:17 - itself
90:17 - and now
90:20 - there we go and i have no frame rate
90:23 - issues
90:25 - pops right up now i
90:28 - want to um i guess now i need to go to
90:30 - zoom
90:31 - that's right now i need to go to my zoom
90:32 - meeting
90:34 - oh it's time for my zoo meeting i'm so
90:37 - excited it's time to be on zoom for the
90:40 - 15th hour of the day
90:43 - let's go to how do i get there
90:47 - without like messing this up i'll make a
90:49 - new window
90:51 - and i'm going to go to a test meeting
90:55 - join obs i need to make sure i am
90:58 - running my
90:59 - virtual camera i going to join my test
91:02 - meeting
91:04 - um join without video yeah yeah yeah i
91:07 - hear the ringtone yeah i'm sure it's all
91:09 - working
91:10 - um now i'm in the meeting and turn on my
91:13 - video
91:14 - um i want to mirror it oh
91:18 - there we go hold on let's just
91:22 - let's go to
91:26 - video settings um
91:31 - mirror my video
91:38 - hello friends welcome to class today on
91:41 - zoom if you have a question please raise
91:44 - your hand
91:53 - all right uh this works i'm so glad
91:56 - this actually works quite well i wonder
91:58 - if there's a better way that i can
91:59 - visually
92:01 - by the way am i missing the oh i can
92:03 - enable hardware acceleration for the
92:05 - browser in
92:06 - obs so that is a thing i could have done
92:09 - but i still like this solution better
92:12 - this feels more flexible
92:15 - i think
92:19 - all right let's i have a half an hour
92:22 - let me make a model with more
92:24 - gestures and also
92:28 - um let me think about if there's a way
92:32 - that i could have
92:34 - other people join the meeting without it
92:36 - being
92:38 - a problem i just feel like it would look
92:40 - more
92:41 - effective if it was like a grid of
92:43 - things but whatever
92:44 - okay um
92:48 - i mean this wasn't my idea but it sort
92:50 - of feels like hey google you made this
92:52 - teachable machine thing
92:53 - you have a product called google meet
92:55 - hit me up let's make this for google
92:57 - meet
92:57 - right you could have this built in you
92:59 - could have even a button that's just
93:00 - like train your gestures in google meet
93:02 - customize your icons and then it just
93:06 - works
93:08 - free advice i guess um
93:14 - okay and by the way this is not specific
93:17 - to zoom i've now created a camera feed
93:19 - on my computer that just does this
93:21 - just to emphasize this even more if i go
93:24 - to like
93:25 - quicktime and i was like oh let me make
93:27 - a new movie recording
93:30 - i could select my obs virtual camera
93:34 - and now i'm in quicktime it shows up as
93:37 - well
93:38 - so the virtual camera is just now a
93:40 - camera that can be sent into anything
93:42 - let's have some more fun with this let's
93:45 - go back to here
93:48 - um what do i got
93:56 - we could do yes and no should we add
93:58 - those
94:01 - it's going to be um
94:11 - let me close this
94:31 - why is this not showing up
94:34 - i mean i could just start over i
94:36 - probably should start over because i've
94:37 - been moving the camera around
94:39 - um yeah by the way there's no reason why
94:42 - i couldn't just do this now
94:43 - also with my live stream so that when i
94:45 - make certain gestures certain things pop
94:47 - up
94:48 - or if i say certain words certain things
94:50 - pop up
94:52 - side project saturday let's let's get
94:54 - that working
94:55 - thumbs up is yes okay but why
94:59 - i'm just going to retrain a new model
95:00 - totally
95:03 - because i don't know why this like is
95:06 - not showing up
95:15 - is the zoom meeting causing a problem
95:19 - i don't have a lot of time here people
95:23 - i was going to do a tutorial on object
95:25 - detection ml5
95:29 - um all right let's restart the browser
95:35 - uh yeah leave site
95:41 - i wonder if like quicktime or let's quit
95:44 - obs
95:44 - i think like the my camera got stuck
95:47 - with something
95:55 - there we go let me just make sure i'm in
95:57 - the right camera okay
96:01 - okay so background is just me
96:04 - someone remind me not to move my laptop
96:06 - around it's just going to be like this
96:07 - with some oh boy the way i put my
96:13 - whoops oh this is going to take too long
96:17 - to delete just start over
96:22 - uh
96:24 - okay this is just me
96:32 - let's do a question
96:45 - let's do a
96:50 - yes
96:57 - i don't know if we're going to be able
96:58 - to get the difference between thumbs up
97:00 - and thumbs down with this kind of
97:06 - let's do a no
97:11 - and then
97:15 - hold on there is a way i can tell it to
97:20 - record with a timer where i don't need
97:22 - to be
97:24 - holding down the button yeah so i can do
97:27 - this
97:29 - hold to record off delay
97:32 - two seconds duration uh six seconds okay
97:36 - this is what i meant this is what i
97:36 - should have been doing all along
97:41 - i don't know i don't know i don't know
97:46 - i don't know
97:52 - um so hold on what do i got here uh
97:55 - i'm going to use lowercase and i'll have
97:56 - to fix it in the code question
97:59 - yes no
98:03 - confused and then
98:06 - let's do something funny
98:10 - uh funny
98:15 - um
98:29 - okay and then i want to do one more
98:31 - which is love
98:46 - let's now try training the model
98:56 - right so chris is suggesting to use
98:58 - posenet
99:00 - and i was thinking about that as well
99:16 - oppose net is a machine learning model
99:18 - that detects key points and it would
99:19 - work really well
99:21 - for a lot of it possibly could even work
99:23 - just with like hand gestures
99:25 - you're not getting a lot of nuance like
99:27 - it would definitely not be able to tell
99:28 - thumbs up or thumbs down
99:30 - um let's see how this works so this is
99:32 - just me did i move my laptop around i
99:34 - hope i didn't
99:35 - uh question okay
99:39 - uh yes no
99:42 - uh confused
99:47 - funny and love oh
99:50 - it works so well yes okay
99:54 - export model um
99:57 - upload my model
100:02 - then uh now i just need this url
100:06 - i need to go to my code
100:09 - so i think this is let me just i should
100:12 - leave this open
100:13 - just in case but let's just make sure
100:16 - this works
100:17 - this is the page for the model
100:21 - background question yes
100:25 - no confused
100:29 - and loved all right all right 20 minutes
100:32 - people i can do this
100:33 - uh now i got to go to the code
100:52 - zoom annotations um
100:58 - let's put in the new model url
101:02 - um let's go and this is now should be
101:05 - lowercase
101:06 - and let's run this see if it's still
101:10 - working
101:11 - with the new model yep new model works
101:14 - okay now i just need to do yes no
101:17 - all right let's do so i'm going to do i
101:19 - this definitely needs the
101:21 - i will refactor this later song
101:24 - but i
101:28 - just got to do this uh
101:36 - let's go to my gesture stickers uh
101:41 - oh i should do one where there's nobody
101:42 - there and that would be the i'll be
101:44 - right back
101:45 - uh sign but you know you get the idea uh
101:48 - yes
101:49 - um so let's make this
101:52 - um what i guess i made them 480. i was
101:56 - wanting to sort of sit on the bottom i
101:57 - just realized but that's fine
101:59 - uh adjust size uh let's make the height
102:02 - 720 pixels
102:06 - okay that's for yes
102:09 - it's fine i've downloaded these it's
102:10 - fine uh no
102:18 - height is 720 pixels uh no
102:21 - so let's change this to a no let's
102:24 - change this to
102:26 - yes let us upload these
102:36 - go to the sketch
102:40 - yes equals let's we'll do two more of
102:43 - these
102:46 - again all this could depend on the array
102:48 - and objects and labels mapped to the
102:50 - object with the knows its fade value
102:52 - but quickly folks let's just make this
102:55 - work
102:56 - and i challenge you i would love for you
102:58 - to help refactor this code when i
102:59 - release it
103:01 - and we're going to just do it in a very
103:02 - silly way else if
103:05 - label equals yes yes fade equals 255.
103:10 - i like sometimes it's very meditative to
103:12 - just copy the same code over and over
103:14 - again
103:14 - this is not a sustainable solution if i
103:16 - wanted to have you know 100 different
103:18 - possible labels
103:19 - well which technically is possible
103:22 - and then and
103:26 - we can actually have multiple ones up
103:28 - here
103:29 - on top of each other and if yes fade
103:33 - yes fade yes yes
103:36 - fade and then we're gonna do
103:40 - no no fade no fade
103:45 - uh no and we're gonna run this
103:50 - just see how it's working
104:06 - awesome now let's get really fancy
104:10 - let's do our love so i'm going to try
104:12 - using an
104:13 - animation now um
104:21 - that's a good one uh but i was thinking
104:24 - of using
104:26 - oh there's that there's so many good
104:27 - ones uh
104:29 - sleeping i have all these animations
104:33 - this is yeah there we go
104:36 - okay this is the one i want to use so
104:39 - let's do
104:40 - uh and and what is its size
104:43 - it's very high uh well we're just gonna
104:46 - it's going to be what it's going to be
104:48 - let's call this one love.mp4
104:52 - i hope this works
104:55 - file upload
104:58 - oops upload i mean i really should make
105:01 - this a gif
105:02 - would be easier but i think this should
105:04 - work as an mp4
105:06 - and let's hit stop i need to do the
105:10 - laughing one
105:12 - so now um
105:19 - what is what am i doing what am i doing
105:20 - love
105:22 - love fade is zero the difference is
105:27 - love equals create i think create video
105:33 - uh love dot mp4
105:36 - then i want to say love dot hide and
105:39 - love dot
105:39 - loop so it just always should be looping
105:41 - i ideally i would want it to start when
105:43 - i make the gesture but
105:46 - i'm not going to worry about that right
105:47 - now so then
105:49 - else if label equals love
105:54 - love fade is 255
105:57 - and then the same exact thing i just am
105:59 - drawing a video
106:02 - if love fade is greater than zero
106:06 - love fade fade
106:09 - love and let me just make sure it's
106:12 - the right and let's sort of see what
106:15 - happens here
106:18 - it's like so little
106:28 - awesome all right one more
106:31 - let's just i want to do another
106:32 - animation but
106:34 - um
106:37 - i think just in the interest of time you
106:40 - can see how you can do an animation
106:42 - i'm going to do
106:43 - [Music]
106:49 - let's go to these let's do for laughing
106:53 - let's go to my
107:01 - this dot character
107:13 - let's just try this
107:19 - and now i want to upload this
107:32 - and a sketch
107:36 - let's go back to the code
107:40 - and uh else if
107:43 - label equals what was it laugh i don't
107:46 - even remember
107:47 - laugh fade equals 255. one more of these
107:53 - this is really painful the way i'm doing
107:55 - this left fade is greater than zero
107:57 - tint by the laugh aid the laugh
108:00 - fate fade goes down
108:04 - and the image is the laugh so i just
108:06 - need
108:08 - variables for that one laugh
108:14 - [Music]
108:16 - and
108:29 - did i call it laugh funny i called it
108:32 - funny
108:36 - so only if the label is funny and i had
108:39 - a mistake there anyway
108:40 - okay let's take a look at this
108:47 - i have a question yes
108:51 - no whoops but i love
108:55 - you
108:59 - okay i think that should be bigger and
109:00 - in the center also
109:02 - uh so let's just quickly
109:07 - ah know what i do i can't get my code
109:10 - back there it is
109:12 - um
109:34 - and how do i make it bigger let's just
109:37 - make it
109:38 - oh it's a square so let's just make it
109:40 - 720 by 720.
109:42 - um and then uh because i've done
109:44 - something awful
109:46 - um let's just say image mode corner for
109:49 - everything else
109:51 - except for this one there's nothing
109:52 - after it okay that should work
109:54 - i feel confident let's hit stop let's do
109:59 - share let's go to present
110:02 - let's go here we've got it open
110:07 - and now i can go back to open broadcast
110:22 - studio
110:24 - i think i moved my laptop
110:36 - come on little heart i love you
110:40 - where are you i love you what happened
110:42 - to the love
110:47 - i i want to make
110:50 - i want to make the love animation appear
110:53 - did something go wrong
111:00 - fail to load the resource oh element
111:02 - play
111:04 - oh so the video won't play because i
111:07 - haven't interacted on the page
111:16 - okay i have a this is super annoying
111:19 - um i am going to
111:21 - [Music]
111:22 - fix that by
111:26 - saying
111:30 - this um
111:37 - ah i
111:40 - oh i got it i got it i mean this is
111:43 - quite a hack but i'm just gonna force
111:46 - myself
111:46 - to press the mouse to play that video
111:49 - because then i'm interacting with it
111:59 - okay there we go
112:03 - there we go
112:06 - okay now back to obs
112:12 - what's going on here
112:18 - why is my camera so like weird
112:20 - resolution wise now
112:22 - hold on
112:26 - okay so these are working color is all
112:28 - weird
112:29 - but let me add my camera again
112:32 - video capture device
112:39 - why does this disappear i'm doing it
112:41 - again and again
112:56 - okay
113:10 - uh
113:14 - i could de-bounce this a little bit
113:16 - better
113:18 - okay use your official uh use your
113:21 - official coding train gifts
113:23 - yeah okay um now
113:30 - it is time to go to my zoom meeting
113:33 - oh it is just time for my zoom meeting
113:35 - would it be great if i had an actual
113:37 - zoom meeting to go to and i could log in
113:39 - right now and unsuspectedly the people
113:42 - joining would see this i'm going to use
113:43 - this later today when i have some
113:44 - meetings
113:46 - so i'm going to go to a meeting now
113:54 - me join my meeting
114:06 - oh i didn't start the yes yes
114:10 - okay so one thing i forgot is i've got
114:12 - to go to up to here
114:14 - tools start virtual camera i need to
114:17 - make sure the browser is actually open
114:18 - to this page
114:20 - now i can go to my meeting i can start
114:23 - my camera
114:26 - i can check like i'm on the
114:29 - virtual camera now here we are hello
114:31 - everybody
114:33 - welcome to today's lesson
114:36 - i have a question i really can't smile
114:39 - right smile that comes up
114:44 - serious question oh it's reversed again
114:48 - when did that happen so confusing
114:59 - oh i can flip it in ob i'm so confused
115:01 - about the flipping
115:05 - let's unflip it i guess
115:11 - i have a question
115:20 - yes
115:23 - but i love you
115:29 - let me do what i meant to do this whole
115:31 - time by the way and i'm going to do this
115:32 - now
115:33 - is i'm going to start recording so this
115:36 - is going to be a separate video feed
115:38 - that if we ever
115:38 - actually do edit this together i could
115:41 - create
115:42 - like put it into a zoom meeting um
115:46 - so now let's go back to zoom
115:51 - and hold on we'll make this i want to
115:54 - make this look
115:55 - well if i minimize that that's a problem
115:57 - will it still work if i minimize it
116:00 - probably not right yeah
116:03 - no that's fine
116:07 - uh it's got to be open somewhere but i
116:09 - could probably drag it off the screen
116:12 - there we go okay so now
116:19 - open up the chat
116:26 - okay i'm trying to make this look
116:30 - like a real meeting which is really
116:40 - ridiculous
116:43 - all right everybody
116:48 - welcome to today's zoom meeting
116:51 - apparently my model if i ever put my
116:52 - mouth thinks i'm laughing
116:55 - and i have a question for you everyone
116:57 - watching
116:58 - no i don't have i have a question yes uh
117:04 - question oh
117:08 - the meeting was ended
117:13 - all right you get the idea let's try
117:15 - that one more time
117:18 - that's where you can by the way see the
117:19 - meeting id and the password to try to
117:21 - join see it is there
117:27 - just to finish this off
117:51 - what happens if i leave
117:58 - all right so this is my demonstration
118:02 - of annotating your zoom video based on
118:06 - uh image classification using teachable
118:08 - machine i did this coding challenge
118:10 - i got a lot of work to do on training my
118:12 - model and debouncing the various pop-ups
118:15 - but we can see that i can one
118:18 - ask a question i can say yes
118:22 - i can say no i can say i love
118:26 - love you yes i love you
118:30 - we all love each other and then i can
118:32 - laugh
118:40 - all right so i could add more things
118:42 - like say goodbye
118:43 - or if i leave i could put something else
118:45 - up there's all sorts of possibilities
118:47 - um i i hope that you can follow this i
118:50 - hope that you can really be more
118:51 - thoughtful about the design
118:52 - and animation and to be honest like
118:55 - there is nothing you couldn't possibly
118:57 - put
118:58 - um you don't have to just layer over
118:59 - your video you could play something else
119:01 - or do a full screen gif
119:02 - there's so many possibilities and all
119:05 - you need to do if you want to use this
119:07 - exact example is just go to
119:11 - this particular url but before you do
119:15 - that actually sorry before you do that
119:17 - you if you if you want to use this exact
119:21 - example
119:21 - all you need to go all you need to do is
119:24 - open the url to this particular p5
119:27 - sketch
119:28 - you do need to train your own model your
119:30 - model should have
119:31 - exactly the same labels everything that
119:34 - i've done here but you should train it
119:35 - with your own images
119:37 - test it to make sure it works then copy
119:40 - paste
119:40 - your model url into this line of code at
119:44 - the top
119:45 - um and then once you do that once you
119:47 - hit run
119:48 - you should see and you've got then run
119:50 - and click the mouse you should see your
119:51 - video down here
119:53 - and your gesture should be able to
119:55 - control these pop-ups
119:57 - now what i would encourage you to do is
119:59 - come up with your own
120:00 - labels and gestures and maybe use
120:02 - objects like what happens when you show
120:03 - it a
120:04 - train whistle or some other object think
120:06 - about what you're actually showing your
120:08 - own
120:09 - images or their animations or you know
120:11 - are can you play pom
120:12 - over yourself like while you're in a zoo
120:15 - meeting uh could you scroll
120:17 - text by you text to speech i would also
120:19 - encourage you to think about
120:20 - accessibility
120:21 - are there ways that you could send audio
120:23 - to zoom um in the sense that instead
120:25 - like when you're laughing it would play
120:26 - a laughing sound effect or when you have
120:28 - a question it would say question or or
120:30 - play a ding
120:31 - um so that for especially for people who
120:33 - might not
120:34 - be able to see the zoom meeting could
120:36 - they experience this result
120:38 - with uh um with audio so if you make
120:41 - anything like that um you know please
120:43 - share with me write a blog post a medium
120:45 - post create a github read me page
120:47 - um because this uh um and and make a web
120:50 - page for it and
120:51 - share it um based on the instructions
120:54 - that you'll find um in this video's
120:55 - description that show you how to
120:56 - add it as a community contribution to
120:59 - the web page for this coding challenge i
121:01 - hope you enjoyed it
121:02 - um i there's probably a million other
121:04 - ways you could do this better
121:05 - than what i did i hope this inspired you
121:07 - thank you i i have to thank
121:09 - um
121:15 - cameron hunter um thank you especially
121:18 - to cameron hunter
121:19 - who where i got this idea from it's not
121:22 - an original idea of mine i just had a
121:23 - lot of fun trying to make this
121:24 - um one thing you'll notice also in his
121:26 - particular example is
121:28 - a lot of the annotations do follow him
121:32 - so yeah you can see how the haha is like
121:34 - moving around
121:35 - and that's something you could also do
121:36 - by adding pose net to this and keeping
121:38 - track of where your nose there's so many
121:39 - things you can do i have to stop talking
121:40 - i have to say goodbye i hope you enjoyed
121:42 - this coding challenge mwah see you soon
121:48 - all right now i pray that all my
121:51 - recording to disc worked
121:54 - uh i'm going to
121:57 - stop this recording to disc um
122:04 - and yeah
122:07 - uh i gotta go 1101. oh perfect timing
122:11 - okay everyone so let me hit stop record
122:14 - uh stop record stop record
122:17 - um i'm still live streaming um i don't
122:19 - not set up with like music
122:21 - and all the other stuff i usually have
122:22 - to do an outro again
122:24 - typically my side project saturdays are
122:27 - the live streams that i'm doing from
122:28 - home
122:29 - um i kind of want to work on this more
122:32 - maybe in a side project saturday so we
122:33 - can add that to the list
122:35 - um so i will see you a week from
122:36 - tomorrow and if you want to join as a
122:38 - member
122:39 - uh we'll see you a week from today
122:41 - hopefully next friday that will be i
122:42 - will get to those ml5 tutorial videos
122:44 - that i also meant to do today
122:46 - but clearly all i got to was make this a
122:47 - particular project
122:49 - which i i did really quite enjoy i hope
122:50 - you enjoyed it and i'm really just going
122:52 - to say goodbye
122:54 - uh i'm going to go out in silence but
122:56 - i'm going to put my little end screen on
122:57 - here oh and
122:59 - i don't have the chat or anything up and
123:01 - i will see you all
123:03 - soon um yeah
123:07 - all right everyone uh have fun
123:10 - with your day i would say give somebody
123:12 - a hug but you can't
123:14 - um be safe consider
123:17 - others i'm going to leave this recording
123:20 - studio
123:23 - i'm going to wash my hands several times
123:27 - go pick up my daughter who had uh in
123:29 - person school today
123:31 - lucky that she can have that today and
123:34 - um
123:35 - stay tuned for the coding challenge
123:38 - video edited video if it recorded a disc
123:40 - if not then this just
123:41 - it is what it is forever for all time
123:45 - um okay how do what i press
123:49 - i press this that's the goodbye screen
123:53 - hopefully you can still hear me but i'm
123:55 - going to press a button that's going to
123:56 - mute my microphone now
123:58 - and i will see you next week
124:23 - you

Cleaned transcript:

so so foreign so so so so so test one two you people can hear me oh that is so strange wow is my audio on because the mic is muted is it this mic no test one two i'm talking directly into the mic this is so strange i can't figure it out huh all right hold on okay the music is off wow the laptop this mic this computer's mic is on hold on we did it no wait no this is so strange hold up now now you hear me okay hold on i i gotta start the stream here to figure this out good morning the music is off i know i turned it off i gotta turn the camera on me let's see if i can make that happen hold on a sec i have to blow my nose which i would normally mute myself for but i have no way of doing that am i further away from the mic i must be further away can you hear me going further away from the mic i do not understand um all right hold on let's get the camera on me hello good morning oh no i just filled a bottle of water welcome to the clothing train where i stole water on my laptop look everything's unplugged oh my god okay now can you hear me you can still hear me this makes no sense this makes no sense hold on is this the microphone i know how to mute it because i see the audio input but i have to put my mask back on because i i am here if i just leave the room will you still be able to hear me i have to go get some paper towels i'll be right back i can't play music i can't do anything just look at the coding train scene is very little water actually got on the laptop it mostly got on this uh cable and dongle not the mic what light could it be all right we're gonna figure this out but first i'm gonna get some paper towels i will be right back so so okay i'm gonna wipe this up here actually i also have this magic green rag it's my invisibility cloak i will also use to wipe this up then let's have a look here at the computer it's just a little bit of like a little splash on the keyboard i think it's fine we'll find out soon enough whoa what just happened there oh this camera went on that's particularly weird why is this camera on this is going super well so far okay i think i know i mean i don't really know but let me take a look here so first um the sound is great so why change it does it actually sound good it doesn't make any sense this is my microphone good morning by the way what you're actually watching is a sneak preview of what you get to watch if you become a member of the coding train because i actually do usually these friday sessions just with the members and i record uh video tutorials that later get released for example um the last week i did one on github pages and that's going to come out this weekend um since i can't live stream tomorrow from my my usual saturday live stream i thought i would open this one up to the community today it's the camera mic is this much louder now all of a sudden me talking showing you my like be like i need to like do some trimming here and get some like shaving things going on is it is it the camera mic oh this mic is it this my oh it's this mic okay hold on uh that is so strange where is this plugged into i don't need this i'm not using this camera i'm gonna unplug this okay i'm going to mute the audio so in case it makes a horrible sound no it's not this mic it's the other camera mic okay so strange oh i know what it is i got it i got it i got it without it i got it yes okay the audio source on obs okay mystery solved now i'm talking into this mic the audio should be better uh this doesn't need to be viewable and also now but why so when the music was playing was the music really sort of like faint and poor quality because it was actually just coming out of my laptop speakers and oh my god um this whole stream might end up getting shut down any moment if like my laptop doesn't work or if something terrible happens yeah it's whoops it's been long enough that a little bit of water is now no long dried from whatever dripped onto the end of this dongle so i think we should be okay okay now audio being quieter is easily fixable because i can just move the volume up now that should be better is this laptop going to come alive oh it's not it's not plugged into power the power did not and you know what i just realized what i should do let me plug in on the other side of the laptop just in case i really need this coffee here much clearer but could be a bit louder okay that's no problem all of that is manageable okay let me uh 9 10 a.m that was very recent so let's let's go into the settings here and we'll make it a little bit louder whoops settings here sensitivity uh this should make it louder no that makes it quieter i think now it should be a little bit louder and even a little bit louder still and there's even a dial here i can turn up so maybe this is better now oh boy okay uh i'm not going to worry about the music right now come back to that uh let's see if uh the laptop is viewable by you there we go we are here oh oh and hold on if you will humor me for again one moment please i will be right back again i'm in a hermetically sealed room but if i leave this room um i must wear my mask and uh which i'm going to do right now i'm going to go into the room next door where my backpack is and get something be right back you can probably still hear me um and now at 9 12 a.m eastern time live from brooklyn new york it is officially the coding train i don't have the belt i managed to remember to throw this train whistle into my backpack this morning so where am i what's going on what's happening um i am uh here at new york university uh where i uh in uh about 100 years ago i used to spend you know at least 75 a large percentage of my waking hours um i work at a program um called itp and ima the statistical of the arts nyu um i have i have been here for the last week um in and out but i hadn't been here since march when uh the covet pandemic really uh reared its head in new york city i've been doing live streaming from home that's my new and actually that's not going away my new system is actually to do side project saturdays um inside project saturdays are a twohour live stream that happens from home last week i worked on uh programming an arduino inside of simone yetch's everyday calendar you can go back and check that live stream those are typically sponsored so i'll often have a sponsor for those um and will happen from home and are informal and hopefully fun and educational and i have all my equipment there um i use this room to record video tutorials for my nyu courses which i also release to the public on the youtube channel um and those my system for that is i'm not monetizing those and i've i'm trying to clean all this up and get sort of organized but those are video tutorials that hopefully anybody can use and access they're all captioned for your curriculum for your enjoyment um and i even i'm i'm open to offering those outside of youtube for any schools or organizations that can't get the content through the youtube platform so um so that's kind of the deal with my fault that's the sort of new schedule i've adopted and to help um sort of keep me going frankly uh you know moral support financial support all those kinds of things um the membership program which you can sign up directly on youtube with join i bro i broadcast the friday recording sessions to the members as um and that's kind of what i would normally be doing today but with the yom kippur holiday this weekend i'm not available i have some family commitments and i'm not available to live stream on saturday so there will be no live stream tomorrow and instead there is today's members and and i i probably shouldn't like talk about this plan in such detail because every time i ever made a plan it lasted about two weeks and then i ended up just doing something different so we'll see if this care this is what i'm hoping will carry me forward through uh at least until december um uh you know assuming that i have access and safe access to this building it's very empty in here um and i actually am tested uh nyu somebody was telling me is like one of the largest testing providers in the country but uh i just had a test a couple days ago and i had tests two weeks ago they're testing us every two weeks so um i'm just looking at the chat here we've got uh chatanya uh um and and sanjeev tandon who's 13 years old and makes many games from tictactoe sanjeev i i got confused looking at your name because the school here the nyu school of engineering is called the tandon school of engineering and that i got kind of confused all right so just to be clear though all of the content then record to disk i'm not yes thank you all the i don't need to do it yet um all of the content that i record on fridays uh will be released and you will be able to see it even if you're not a member um it just will you'll be able to see it a week later or so depending on how long it takes to kind of get that out all right now i only have till 11 a.m this morning because uh half day the school where my children go in here in brooklyn um has half days on fridays which by the way a half day ends at 11 30 a.m that's not that's like me having my breakfast and checking my email but instead i'm here with you and i've just turned on all my equipment and i'm live streaming but i gotta just jump in i wanted to acknowledge something i want to work with the ml5 library today and i wanted to um acknowledge some of the work that uh in particular several uh processing foundation ml5 fellows worked on over the summer and that that unoriginal pun that recorded disk reminder i want it again in just like a few minutes so i don't need to record this part to disk yet although you know what let me start recording to disk so i can double check to make sure the recording is working so um and i see more messages into the chat you know unfortunately i'm not really i kind of respond and check out the chat randomly so um i appreciate your messages there the best place to engage with the community is the discord i think do i still have that discord button no this is a different i don't have my my just i only have this tiny stream deck that has uh 15 buttons i have the one at home has like 34 or something okay last sorry i'm setting up the record to disk hopefully i'm seeing all my presets and i'm hitting and so now i'm recording to disk i will check those files in a little bit um so unfortunately i don't get your question i would appreciate if you didn't post it multiple times because that kind of makes the chat harder for other people to engage with know that there are some moderators and they'll they can record your question and if you join the discord hopefully somebody can post the link to the discord that's another place to engage with the community and get advice there so um but there's something else i wanted to say that was reminding me i was recording to disk i was looking at that oh well i'll just never mind let me go uh let me go to where i meant to go so i'm going to go to processing foundation medium let's look under fellowships and i wanted to highlight there's a lot of things to highlight here of course but i specifically since i'm going to work with ml5 today i wanted to highlight the work of fellows emily martinez who is working on a project with an ml5 community starter kit um i want to look at bomani's work which i definitely have referenced making ml5.js accessible bomani is one of the sort of lead maintainers of the github repos um so check out his amazing work his own artworks as well in addition to his open source work but what was uh um mentioned to me was to highlight was um andreas refsgard work because there's some i'm going to try to create a sort of goofy ml5.js demo today and that's the project that um uh a that andreas worked on over the summer so this is teddy rhymes with steady one of the examples combines image classification from ml5.js with the rhyming algorithm in rita.js that is awesome i got to show this to my class uh so um check out this work i i would love to sort of click through and play with these but i as you know if you've ever watched me before i get really distracted and i ah that's what i was saying about half day friday is only until 11 because i gotta go pick her up um and i i like i have to leave you know when i say 11 like if i'm here until 11 15 i'm like fine but uh 11 is when i need to be wrapping up and starting to say goodbye okay so keep help me that um oh no so we need a video i need to work on my pronunciation of andreas refsgard which is how i always say it which i'm sure is incorrect i'm really working on christian vekman no question question shoot i had it down the other day and then simone yetch i've been like that that one i've been pronouncing simone has a whole video about how to pronounce her name i like by the way that people were like on the internet were like oh it's so great that my two favorite youtubers know each other i'm like well actually we have net in person we did this like brief panel thing at the thinkercon thing but we i mean we're not i mean uh that what i did was just like an unofficial like i'm just playing around with the um uh uh everyday calendar which i which i'm hoping to do more of but i can't do that today because i don't have it with me all right and all right thank you to oh boy a uh a name that is written in cyrillic who is a number one fan thank you for the super chat uh that is very kind of you um and i don't have any of my i don't have my sound board all i have is the train whistle i was able to get that and bring it from home so i'll blow a train whistle for you um but i'm going to move on all right so i think what i need to do here to figure out what i'm going to do is the following um i don't know if i'm logged in on twitter or what nope here we go this is what i'm looking for all right so this is what i'm hoping to build today and i suppose if you would now if you wouldn't mind um just giving me a minute to check that my record to disk is working um and i normally i would actually let's and also why not figure out if i can figure out the sound thing so in theory if i play this you can hear it through this mic and i should be able to pipe it out via loopback what's this no that's terminal right so this is what i'm doing by the way i'm picking up the audio from the finder and i'm sending it out via the speakers which i could turn off but i'm also sending it to pro capture that's the capture card on the streaming computer so let's turn this off for a second so we know it's not going through my any mic in the room and now i just want to see if i can figure out which input that is in the obs properties for you to hear the music zero i thought it was o2 no oh that's whoops what just happened cancel oh laptop audio sorry that's what i'm doing uh properties um audio one audio two okay that's it now but that's what i had i thought so now you hear the you hear the audio you hear the music correct but if i mute my mic do you still hear me you still hear me it's like combined it's picking up multiple feeds that is crazy all right i i can't deal with this right now we're just not going to worry about it okay i i'm i'm not going to get my laptop audio today and i'm not going to worry about it i don't know why obs is picking up both i guess the capture card it has multiple inputs into it and they're being combined somehow it's just not worth worrying about okay so let me get everything that i want to do more where's teachable machine here it is digital machine and let me just make sure i want to make sure this code example still works this is a code example that's doing image classes funny i trained it on this train whistle it's a good thing i have it with me today and did i mirror that if i flipped the image no let me just fix that um because that's sort of important for me to do so i'm just getting myself ready ml5 teachable machine image model i think this one has the flip video code in it yep so i need flipped video and then i need flip image there and then whenever i classify i flip the image here's the classify function and i assume i classify the flipped video and then i can just draw the flipped video also let's see if this works oh shoot um boo preload flipped video oh wait a second no that's the same i mean i could just use this example as my basis why don't i just use this example as my basis because this i'm just going to use this example i don't need my fancier one because i want to code this stuff anyway so let's just use this example to make sure it's working and let's also go here and i think this is how you do css no i don't know there we go okay okay this is working oh great okay and all right everybody record to disk let me check the recording i'm gonna look has it been a half an hour because it makes a new file once it's a half an hour um and what's today's date the 25th uh no i have i started at 9 18. so i'm going to stop the recording and restart it just to check the files i'm going to do that real quick stop multicorder and then let me look at one of the files just to see if it's stuttering i need to see some place where i'm moving around a lot i see your audio in it and it doesn't look like i'm it's stuttering okay so i think the recording to disc you know i just have to say my recording to disc prayer and um here we go oh did i forget like yeah thank you i guess i need that and all right all right everyone i don't know what the pink artifacts are but i'm hoping what i'm about to do will be accomplishable in about one hour um and oh let me log out log in great still working i am ready to go okay uh i did i start recording again after i checked it yes thank you for asking that question that is the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me worst case uh you know first of all i'm trying one of the things that i really want to avoid doing is the live streaming then reediting the live stream for a separate upload so that's why i'm kind of separating the friday and saturday but today i'm going back to my old ways but worst case scenario if the record to disk stuff doesn't really work i'm making this project we're doing it it's this live stream will be archived forever i don't necessarily need an edited version that gets released it's a coding challenge but let's see if i can make that happen and here we go pink noise all over the place can somebody in the uh discord chat tell me whether i can ignore these messages that are in the in the main chat um but probably it's like my keying is bad or something okay oh in the search bar oh yeah oh oh yeah why is that so guess what i am not seeing these on my laptop screen i am only seeing them in the output to obs which i can only which i can only surmise is due to the fact that this cable had water spilled on it i don't have another one but i do have a solution which is i can record to disk my um but let's see if unplugging it and plugging it back in fixes the issue that's still there weird hold on i'm looking really close i don't see it on my laptop screen um the sad thing is i could totally record my laptop screen separately but i was going to do something else specifically for recording my laptop screen for the later edited video but let's just because i need to i can't require it's going to use obs i guess i can use quick i can't record my lap it's going to be fun it's going to have to be fine is it always there or is it no it's actually in that doesn't make any sense that's really weird all right i definitely need to ignore this but i i you know i have a problem where like little tiny things drive me crazy um optimize for pro capture standard refresh rate that seems weird why is it why is it 59.88 um definitely don't want to change it to true tone it's funny that true tone got rid of it i think do i have a filter on in obs oh that's possible i have been mucking around with my obs settings let's just quickly oh i know another way i can check this my record to disk has a separate feed of the no it's there it's there in the separate it's not a it's not a filter in obs and it's much more apparent also oh this is driving me crazy everyone's telling me to ignore it but i it's making me crazy i let me have four minutes it's 9 30 eight i have to stop looking into this um oh yeah i was looking for displays that's what it's at 1080p 1080i no whoa much worse right what is going on so strange um what's confusing me is i swear when i just turned on is this like is this did that get rid of it that got rid of it right i don't know why but like there it is it's gone right so for whatever reason this pro capture color profile is doing something weird and then no no it's still there no it's gone did that fix it i can't it's so hard for me to tell it's gone okay just let me believe it's gone that's better anyway uh it's good now okay i'm gonna move on all right 9 30 oh i i took two more minutes i gave myself two more minutes sd170ma was better i don't believe you is that better all right let me double check to make sure there's no filter in obs but i'm kind of that's me that's the audio that's the laptop filters no filters on sd 170 whatever is better okay so i'm going to use that and hopefully this will be fine i'm just going to look at it in my record to disk software it's still like there faintly but whatever gotta move on gotta move on to two all right i'm gonna be using the whiteboard today people okay faintly there all right hi everyone no that's not a good way to start restart i don't think it's chrome i really don't think it's the chrome browser welcome to a coding challenge let's get ready to coding challenge 9 38 all right 9 38 here we go hello everyone and welcome to a coding challenge the first one since march of 2020 and what i am going to attempt to do today is make my own version of this project this is not my idea uh this came across my twitter desk the other day from cameron hunter who created a video lens that uses hand gestures to show comic book style messages instead in a video called you know i don't know if you noticed in this year of 2020 lots of stuff is happening but many of us including myself are spending a large amount of time in video calls and i want to see if i can figure out a way using the tools of p5.js ml5.js teachable machine and open broadcast studio and zoom as the video conference software of choice not sponsor you could use anyone that you want but i'm going to attempt to use zoom and see if i can create my own overlays that are controlled with my own gestures that's what's going to happen today i have not attempted this at any point in the past present or future so here we go so to be honest there's not going to be a tremendous amount of coding in this particular video there will be however a lot of like piecing together a lot of different parts of tools and software and things like that and i'm doing the thing where i'm allowing myself to to do stuff again which i shouldn't do because probably my recorded disc is failing and this is just to just be a thing that i'm making and there's not really going to be any editing i should put a timer on and give myself a certain amount of time i should just go for it to be honest there's probably not going to be a ton of coding in this although i will be writing code and mostly i'm going to be like plugging in this piece of software to this piece of software and this piece of software lots of connectors and tubes and cables and things but all um happening on the computer because i'm much too afraid to use that stuff in real physical life okay so let me talk through what the components are so what i'm going to have ultimately is a video feed where for example when i raise my hand and apparently i can't draw that's me raising my hand i might have a popup that says you know question a big popup so that the other people in the room can see that i'm raising my hand and i have a question so this is what i want so how am i going to get there so to do this i'm going to use a p5.js to connect to my camera and show my camera feed then i'm going to use a teachable machine to train a machine learning model to recognize my particular gestures so just as point out if you're you should be able to do this yourself at the end of this video and you won't even have to write any of your own code you could reuse my code but almost certainly well definitely you will need to train your own model so i'll talk about how to do that which you don't need to do any coding for machine learning model so once i have that and then i'm going to talk to the teachable machine model with ml5.js so all of these components will be running in a web browser this is all inside the web browser then i'm going to use a piece of software called obs or open broadcast studio it is the software i'm using right now to live stream to record to disk it is software that i use for making youtube videos but what i can do with obs one of the things i can do is i can capture everything that's in the browser so the browser is going to be sent into obs and then this picture blues diagram is terrible you will see in obs then from obs i'm going to start something called a virtual camera so i'm going to trick the computer into thinking that the open broadcast studio software is my webcam so when i log into a zoom meeting and there is a grid of people and this is me here i will select the obs virtual cam as my video input so instead of picking the default you know if i'm on a mac it's going to say like facetime camera i'm going to switch to obs virtual camera this is not the only way to do this as you can see uh in the project i reference where i got this idea from it's using something like snap lens studio something i'm sure there are countless other ways you could approach this but i never really thought this diagram was going to be helpful hopefully it's at least it's helping me sort of think through this um i i'm hoping this is going to work again i haven't tried this yet so remains to be seen all right let's do the first part train the model so i'm going to go to the teachable machine website now i could really if i wanted to just talk for the next like hour about what teachable machine is uh fortunately i'm not gonna do that and if you want to learn more about teachable machine i have three videos that i've already made about how to train a model and use it with p5 and you can do stuff with audio there's lots of stuff there google has a lot of resources it's a it's made by folks at the google creative lab um i'll include a lot of references in the video subscription of course to teachable machine i'm just going to click on to get started i want to do an image project because i want to train a model from my on me and i'm going to first create the first i'm just going to do i'm going to do like back i'm going to do background i'm going to call background being like me not doing anything just me just kind of sitting in the meeting like this trying to make eye contact with people over a computer through a web have you ever tried it doesn't work how do you make the eye contact where do i look i got to just look at myself which is weird but it's like that's what my eye is drawn to is that like that for you or is it just me am i weird i think i'm weird it's definitely weird and then the next uh category will be question so i want to click webcam and um you can see i've already installed by the way virt obs virtual camera on this computer so you can see this is like it's already available but that's not what i want right now i want the facetime camera and i just want to like record myself here what do i do in a meeting no i don't don't make any gestures okay so that's probably good enough and then i want to do the question um the question now will i what hand do i raise i have a question it's confusing because i want to i need to use my mouse i guess i'm going to be lefthanded for asking my questions i'm going to try to get about the same amount of samples like 238 okay and i'm going to train this model i get to take a little break here remember the don't switch tabs song i don't i don't know in my ukulele but i had it don't switch the tabs don't switch the tabs oh it trained okay so let's see if it's working background question background question so this is perfect so now i have a model trained it's very important i mean even though i talk about all this in the teachable machine videos and i'm trying not to do this now it's important for me to emphasize this is not doing any kind of gesture recognition this is pure image classification so it's not going to work if i gave this model to you and you're wearing a different shirt you have different hair you're not wearing glasses your background is different um so this is the kind of thing that every person would have to customize which i think is nice because you can make up your own gestures and different things and everybody moves in different ways and does different types of things gotta move on that's the song that's stuck in my head today uh all right so now export model and certainly i could download the model all this could be done locally without anything being anywhere in the cloud all of those images were not sent anywhere into the cloud you can with teachable machines save them the google drive but i do want to upload the model it's just going to make it very convenient for me to work with so i'm going to upload the model now i have the url right here which i'm going to click copy then i'm going to go over to the ml5 code example so let's call this zoom zoom annotations i don't know if that makes sense let's get rid of this just want to simplify this example it actually has some extra stuff in it that i don't need and let's run it so this is the example that comes with ml5 and it's just actually it's a pretrained model that is showing that has two categories daytime or night time so it's hard to make a model that people can universally test and use but this is one and now so now in theory if i were to go and paste the url remember where did i get that from right from here this shareable link of the model by the way you could go there right now and try it i don't know if anybody can manage to like get it into the chat who's watching right now i'm going to paste it in here my font is very small i've pasted it in and i'm going to run the example again what oh there's a mistake here ah okay so this this will hopefully be fixed by the time you watch this video i actually updated the examples it needs to also have uh added the to the end of the url i need to add plus model.json that's what ml5 is looking for that particular json file that holds the information about the model background question background question all right let's get at least a quick popup of a question mark to appear when i say i have a question i have an insane amount of all right okay um before i do that let me make a couple quick changes i want to just um make this a little bit bigger uh and then i want the uh i'm always going to have the video size match um the canvas size and then i actually don't want to draw the text label that's not something i'm doing um so let me just make sure this works still and we see it a little bit bigger so i should be able to say now if label equals question draw something else and i happen to have a thank you to jason heglund who is the coding trained illustrator makes all the characters um i think i have one of these that i can use let's try using this one so i should be able to upload a file and drag it here it's kind of like a weird name let me just rename this i'm just going to call it uh question.png and then in the sketch i want to say question and i'll preload that image question preload a question.png then let us try to say image question zero zero so i'm not really being thoughtful about this let's just see if it appears whoops what happened what preload no the function name is load image this is me trying to do stuff way too quickly making weird mistakes also my computer feels like it's dying here save i think this page froze ah let's try this again let's see if i can at least get something to appear okay come on people debugging time oh guess what folks i named my labels with a capital q capital first letter okay and by the way i really should uh check and see like what is the resolution of this image it is that's a little bit unnecessary for me right now let's fix that um let's just put this on the desktop we'll call this uh question dot png i want it to be like the character sitting on the bottom so let me adjust the size to 480 better then i'll reupload it better okay here we go again so one thing i really want to do which i feel like is important here is to kind of debounce this a little bit so i feel like if it's going to appear i don't want it to uh disappear immediately like i don't want it to flicker so i'm just going to always have it fade out so let me just i think i can use i mean i should make like an object there's all sorts of ways i could engineer this in a really thoughtful way but i am going to just do a i'm going to make a variable called fade out and set it equal to 255 and then whenever i detect a particular label i'll say fade out equals 255 and then and let me put this i'm just bear with me i'm gonna have to think about how to do this with multiple things but let me just get this to work right now fade out minus equals five let's make minus equal to ten um if fade out is less than zero i'll say fade out is greater than zero image question so and actually fade out should be zero so you know what this is this is why i need to like wrap these two things together into like an object or something but let's just have question fade be at zero and what i'm really doing is i'm setting question fade to 255 whenever i get that label and then i'm always fading it out and i'm only drawing it if i have a value greater than zero and just for efficiency's sake i'll also just fade it out when it's greater than zero so this should now um it should always it shouldn't like flicker like uh i didn't oh i i have to sorry i that's actually like just leaving it there it's actually going to fade it so i was going to say tint question fade which i i realized it actually is i debounced it just by not even having it fade but oh hello that tint applies to everything whoa that was weird i don't know why it is uh that's the way the image fades maybe somebody can can investigate that is that like a bug in p5 or is that actually how it's supposed to work do i need to do like oh maybe i need to do this so i'm definitely fading oh i'm just fading the brightness there we go that's what i was looking to do so that's i was i want the brightness to always be at 255 but i want to fade the alpha okay so now let's see if we can get this into a zoom meeting now obviously of course we could spend hours making like little animations and training different gestures and after i get it all working i want to spend a little time making a version of this with with some animations and different things but i just want to see if i can at least get this into a zoom meeting so the first thing i need to do is open up open broadcast studio so this is the website for obs studio it's open source it's free there are some like other companies who have made their own versions of obs that are maybe paid and different things but this is the one that i use i just use the free open source open broadcaster studio i guess it's broadcaster software who knows oh it's open broadcaster software studio i guess that is the correct way to say it um and um so i already have that on my computer i'm going to open it up when you open it up it should look blank just like this it's an empty window and i have been actually hoping to make some obs tutorials and i've just never gotten around to it so this that's not what this is going to be i'm just going to quickly show you a few steps to get this working but at some point i will maybe also create some tutorials for it all right so i have a scene that's what's down here i can make multiple scenes but i just want to use the default scene now i need a source so normally what i might do and just is i might say something like video capture device but i'm going to i'm thinking about this um ultimately what i probably want to do and i'll see if i can get this working later is select a video capture device i'm going to call this a webcam and i'm going to pick my webcam and have that be the sort of main element of the scene and then the other stuff would be an overlay over it which i think i have an idea of how to do but right now i'm just going to try to get the raw browser window into into this so it won't be pixel perfect in terms of resolution and everything but it'll be a start so let me i'm gonna i'm gonna take that out and delete it and i'm going to say is it window capture display capture i think it's window capture and i want to capture a p5 web editor and i think the best way for me to do this is to go to share and take the let's take the present mode and open a new window paste it in there i can even make it a little bigger just by zooming in let's make sure this is working oh did i not hit save shoot let me hit save and go back to this window and actually i just want to like do this because let's see if it's working great okay so now uh in obs i want to take chrome how come i don't see it here shouldn't i see one that says chrome like i don't want this oh there it is i don't know why i didn't see it before i want to take the one that says google chrome webcam image classification so i want to take that then i'm going to say ok then i'm going to use the option key to like just crop around the part that i want again this is silly there are some better ways that i could do this probably but i'm just going to crop around the part that i want and then i will stretch it out and it's the wrong aspect ratio so maybe i'll just like no how do i do this i'll just crop out some of the bottom i don't know let's just leave it like this we're going to work on the layout later and now i've got it in obs and whenever i raise my hand it's happening you can see the frame rate is really low i'm going to work on a way to fix this yeah um i'm going to see if that works i just didn't want to try that first there's some good suggestions in the chat about capturing the browser directly in obs but let's just leave this now the next thing that i want to do is start the obs virtual camera so that is an option i have right here under tools start virtual camera that is an option i have over here under tools i'm saying this again actually that's an option i have over here under tools start virtual camera the re that does not come by default with obs studio hopefully this is the one that i'm using but um so on the obs project forum there's a post called obs virtual camera 2.0.5 and this is what you can follow these instructions to install the virtual camera and i believe oh it definitely supports mac because i have it for mac is it a different one for mac let's just see yeah so um this one is actually the one for whoops this one is actually the one for windows so if you're on windows you can just run this particular installer that you can download from github let's see if we can find the mac one oh yeah and um and for mac there's this particular obs virtual cam that you can just download and run the installer right here and i'll include links to both of these for mac and windows in the video's description and somebody in the chat telling me there's a way to use v4l to sync on linux so i'll try to include some information for that as well so i'm going to do oh i already so i've started the virtual camera and now i need to go into a zoom meeting so time out for a second i'm going to use uh a link that i know that opens a test meeting it might be that this is exposed to those of you watching in which case uh i would ask you not to join the meeting or at least i'll try to like but if you do you're not you're not helping anybody you're just making this experience it's worse for me and everybody else so hopefully that won't happen um okay so i'm going to go um because i have a zoom account through nyu i'm going to nyu.zoom dot us slash test and this should open up a test meeting let's go into the meeting and i'm going to say join without video just for the moment yeah yeah yeah i think you're working okay so normally if i start my video um this is just me in the zoom meeting uh with this uh the video that's the webcam and now i should be able to go over here and change to obs virtual camera i forgot that i opened it up here and there we go here we go i'm in the zoom meeting hi everybody oh oh this is such a great discussion glass thingy me oh it's reversed oh you know what it is i think zoom is just showing it reversed for me right is um let's go into video settings oh because i've already flipped it oh yeah so when does anybody know this mirror my video oh touch up my appearance i definitely want to do that um does this mirror my video only mirror it for you to see yourself mirrored or does it actually mirror it for other people i don't know i don't know if anybody knows so because it's flipped because zoom is trying to make it a nice experience for me i'm going to uncheck this mirror my video and i've already mirrored it in my own software and now i have a question um all right um so i want to think about ways to improve this which i have some ideas about i'm told the pink noise is back it's so minor though no big deal all right um let's close out of the meeting let's close this page let's disable this in obs yeah um all right the first thing i want to do is i want to try and see what happens so i've got lots of stuff open by the way so let's turn this off um this is stopped okay first things first let's see what happens the first thing i want to try is let's see how the builtin browser to obs works i am going to do um a browser source i'm going to paste in the link to my p5 sketch i kind of have a feeling i'm going to there's going to be a problem here and i have a way around it i'm going to hit ok i've added a browser source i want this particular url oh i put that in the title for it i don't know that i care about this css but i'll leave it with let's leave it at 800 by 600 right now and let's say okay now the reason why i think it's not working is it doesn't have permission to open the camera the builtin browser to obs probably doesn't have permission so i have a way around this i anticipated this issue let's download the code put it on the desktop call it zoom let's open up terminal let's run a web server so i think oh even for localhost i thought the browser doesn't ask permission for a localhost so this is working i thought now i could put maybe if i say localhost it won't no it still asks permission um let's see if this works this is unfortunate we'll have to sneeze uh local host control audio no use custom frame right now so anything i can do here does anyone know whether obs has like a console or anything i can do enable media stream you need to run obs with a flag to automatically give permission that's very interesting how would i possibly do that obs executable dash dash enable me okay all right so i'm making this unfortunately additionally complicated but let's quit obs go to uh terminal oh whoops let's actually keep this running so where do i want to go go to applications and then oh maybe it's hold on yeah obs app this is what i would do on a mac oh i mean you oh i'm in okay right that runs it but can i put those arguments here or do i can i do this no that was weird or do is it in the contents like the actual oh no no i want the folder i think i can do like show package contents contents it must be this right this must be the executable contents mac os whoa oh what oh okay let's try this enable media stream um remote debugging port equals nine two two two to get debugging in a browser okay let's try this no reads input from note field arcs args dash dash arcs this is not what i expected to be doing i think i can do this there we go so now a browser a localhost oh whoops local host local host ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding the only unfortunate thing is it went and got my obs virtual camera not the actual facetime camera but that worked so how do i tell it now i have to write something in the code to select the right camera or i have to change the default camera of the obs browser oh this is so sad oh that's such a pain i have another idea for how to do this that i think will probably be just fine but i would prefer to really get this working working um how do i change so let's do p5.js enumerate cameras i've seen this select cameras um so console log devices object object object virtual camera facetime camera okay so uh this should work hey all right okay so let me take this and hold on i have this open already so now i'm going to set the default camera i'm going to work from localhost i think from now on and i want to set the default camera so where do i let's just paste this all in and see what i need setup i need to do enumerate devices in setup then i need the got devices function i don't really think that i necessarily need this array but i'll just keep it so let's put that here just so i can find it and then i want to set devices 1 and create capture with the video so then i should be able to i should be able to change this to video equals create capture set the size hide it and do all this stuff here once i've selected the correct camera oh i'm i'm really off the rails now with this very simple example that i made um okay how we doing here i think i'm in pretty good shape this needs to go this needs to go let's take a look at localhost okay that's working here now we should be able to actually actually just be able to refresh this i think will this refresh it no um do i really have to like remove it add the browser again oh wait it's not there still i thought it would be underexisting come on did i not say did i oh i didn't restart the server yeah i did is it caching it oh wait no there's no server running that was weird let's try this i mean i can also just go back to the browser now oh this is crazy what i'm doing why am i taking all this time to do this hold on let's just be really sure about this by uh also making a different port let me use whoops is it like this okay i'm running it on a different port just to be a hundred percent sure let me make sure this works here oh weird i actually didn't test this code it's doing something weird now what did i do wrong i think i i must not have saved it okay video create capture with height size oh i have this too sorry this has to go so uh we've got an error where oh because i gotta wait until flipped video is actually available i think by the way i i'm missing an important setting here i don't realize i didn't have that set here okay there we go okay now localhost 8081 is working now i should be able to go back to obs this probably isn't going to be any faster frame rate rise i just want to i i because there's something i can do here which is really awesome just give me a second i'm getting there localhost and put this in there hit ok there we go wow i think the builtin obs browser is like really bad this is worse because i forgot that this whole sketch is operating with like webgl i mentioned there's no like webgl opengl context uh the best thing for me to do would actually be use like uh websockets or something and run a server but i have this idea went nowhere so this will get edited out all right and if if this gets edited into the coding challenge i'll i'll explain so um in case i this all by recorded this is actually called it 25 minutes ago so it's chris manning sorry about that um i'm going to act as if my recorded disc is working and we're actually going to edit this into something so i just tried to see if i could get this to perform better by running opening an actual browser source within open broadcast studio itself and i had to jump through some hoops to like enable the video capture and all this stuff but it's actually much much worse and i believe this is because teachable machine runs in the opengl com with the opengl context using web i believe this is because i believe this is because a teachable machine runs using the webgl context to do the to run the machine learning model and that probably is not something that performs well in open broadcast studio but it is i say i have a better idea better than all of my ideas here it comes okay i'm thinking about this i mean what i really want to do is run i'm going to do it the way i'm just going to do it the simplest way i can think of it okay this is what i'm going to do i'm going to make a uh what's 16 by 9 like 1280 by 720. i'm going to make a 1280 by 720 canvas i'm going to make the video as small as possible so let's see even if i do it like 160 by 120 and i'm going to hide it i'm not going to hide it i want to see that video separately and then i don't want to draw the video instead i just want to see the image pop up so let's see if this works so i've got my video at the bottom right and i'm able to get the question mark to pop up great so now i'm going to go to the present view again my i moved the camera around which i think is causing a bit of a problem i'm going to have to retrain the model which i'll do let me go back to here this is working pretty well and i want to change the background to a pure green actually i could just make a trans no i'm going to do a pure green and you'll see why in a second so stop did i not hit save now this should run much faster because i am passing a very small video to the machine learning model i don't need a high resolution video to do the classification and i'm also not drawing it so it's much less work for me not to actually draw the video just draw this because now what i can do in open broadcast studio which i can open again and let me delete these other elements i can actually just add my camera source directly so i want to add the facetime camera i'm going to add it here i'm going to stretch it out to take up the full and you can see the frame rate is very fluid here then i'm going to add as another scene a window capture and i'm going to get the browser i don't know why i'm always making a new one but that's fine and i want to get i want to grab this which is here hit ok i'm going to stretch this out but i'm going to crop it around the canvas i'm going to fill the window basically with it then i'm going to add a filter in obs i'm going to go to filters i'm going to add an effect filter i'm going to go to chroma key and i want to chroma key the green out so i'm going to say the default's going to work really well i have a perfect chroma key because i drew the green itself and now there we go and i have no frame rate issues pops right up now i want to um i guess now i need to go to zoom that's right now i need to go to my zoom meeting oh it's time for my zoo meeting i'm so excited it's time to be on zoom for the 15th hour of the day let's go to how do i get there without like messing this up i'll make a new window and i'm going to go to a test meeting join obs i need to make sure i am running my virtual camera i going to join my test meeting um join without video yeah yeah yeah i hear the ringtone yeah i'm sure it's all working um now i'm in the meeting and turn on my video um i want to mirror it oh there we go hold on let's just let's go to video settings um mirror my video hello friends welcome to class today on zoom if you have a question please raise your hand all right uh this works i'm so glad this actually works quite well i wonder if there's a better way that i can visually by the way am i missing the oh i can enable hardware acceleration for the browser in obs so that is a thing i could have done but i still like this solution better this feels more flexible i think all right let's i have a half an hour let me make a model with more gestures and also um let me think about if there's a way that i could have other people join the meeting without it being a problem i just feel like it would look more effective if it was like a grid of things but whatever okay um i mean this wasn't my idea but it sort of feels like hey google you made this teachable machine thing you have a product called google meet hit me up let's make this for google meet right you could have this built in you could have even a button that's just like train your gestures in google meet customize your icons and then it just works free advice i guess um okay and by the way this is not specific to zoom i've now created a camera feed on my computer that just does this just to emphasize this even more if i go to like quicktime and i was like oh let me make a new movie recording i could select my obs virtual camera and now i'm in quicktime it shows up as well so the virtual camera is just now a camera that can be sent into anything let's have some more fun with this let's go back to here um what do i got we could do yes and no should we add those it's going to be um let me close this why is this not showing up i mean i could just start over i probably should start over because i've been moving the camera around um yeah by the way there's no reason why i couldn't just do this now also with my live stream so that when i make certain gestures certain things pop up or if i say certain words certain things pop up side project saturday let's let's get that working thumbs up is yes okay but why i'm just going to retrain a new model totally because i don't know why this like is not showing up is the zoom meeting causing a problem i don't have a lot of time here people i was going to do a tutorial on object detection ml5 um all right let's restart the browser uh yeah leave site i wonder if like quicktime or let's quit obs i think like the my camera got stuck with something there we go let me just make sure i'm in the right camera okay okay so background is just me someone remind me not to move my laptop around it's just going to be like this with some oh boy the way i put my whoops oh this is going to take too long to delete just start over uh okay this is just me let's do a question let's do a yes i don't know if we're going to be able to get the difference between thumbs up and thumbs down with this kind of let's do a no and then hold on there is a way i can tell it to record with a timer where i don't need to be holding down the button yeah so i can do this hold to record off delay two seconds duration uh six seconds okay this is what i meant this is what i should have been doing all along i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know um so hold on what do i got here uh i'm going to use lowercase and i'll have to fix it in the code question yes no confused and then let's do something funny uh funny um okay and then i want to do one more which is love let's now try training the model right so chris is suggesting to use posenet and i was thinking about that as well oppose net is a machine learning model that detects key points and it would work really well for a lot of it possibly could even work just with like hand gestures you're not getting a lot of nuance like it would definitely not be able to tell thumbs up or thumbs down um let's see how this works so this is just me did i move my laptop around i hope i didn't uh question okay uh yes no uh confused funny and love oh it works so well yes okay export model um upload my model then uh now i just need this url i need to go to my code so i think this is let me just i should leave this open just in case but let's just make sure this works this is the page for the model background question yes no confused and loved all right all right 20 minutes people i can do this uh now i got to go to the code zoom annotations um let's put in the new model url um let's go and this is now should be lowercase and let's run this see if it's still working with the new model yep new model works okay now i just need to do yes no all right let's do so i'm going to do i this definitely needs the i will refactor this later song but i just got to do this uh let's go to my gesture stickers uh oh i should do one where there's nobody there and that would be the i'll be right back uh sign but you know you get the idea uh yes um so let's make this um what i guess i made them 480. i was wanting to sort of sit on the bottom i just realized but that's fine uh adjust size uh let's make the height 720 pixels okay that's for yes it's fine i've downloaded these it's fine uh no height is 720 pixels uh no so let's change this to a no let's change this to yes let us upload these go to the sketch yes equals let's we'll do two more of these again all this could depend on the array and objects and labels mapped to the object with the knows its fade value but quickly folks let's just make this work and i challenge you i would love for you to help refactor this code when i release it and we're going to just do it in a very silly way else if label equals yes yes fade equals 255. i like sometimes it's very meditative to just copy the same code over and over again this is not a sustainable solution if i wanted to have you know 100 different possible labels well which technically is possible and then and we can actually have multiple ones up here on top of each other and if yes fade yes fade yes yes fade and then we're gonna do no no fade no fade uh no and we're gonna run this just see how it's working awesome now let's get really fancy let's do our love so i'm going to try using an animation now um that's a good one uh but i was thinking of using oh there's that there's so many good ones uh sleeping i have all these animations this is yeah there we go okay this is the one i want to use so let's do uh and and what is its size it's very high uh well we're just gonna it's going to be what it's going to be let's call this one love.mp4 i hope this works file upload oops upload i mean i really should make this a gif would be easier but i think this should work as an mp4 and let's hit stop i need to do the laughing one so now um what is what am i doing what am i doing love love fade is zero the difference is love equals create i think create video uh love dot mp4 then i want to say love dot hide and love dot loop so it just always should be looping i ideally i would want it to start when i make the gesture but i'm not going to worry about that right now so then else if label equals love love fade is 255 and then the same exact thing i just am drawing a video if love fade is greater than zero love fade fade love and let me just make sure it's the right and let's sort of see what happens here it's like so little awesome all right one more let's just i want to do another animation but um i think just in the interest of time you can see how you can do an animation i'm going to do let's go to these let's do for laughing let's go to my this dot character let's just try this and now i want to upload this and a sketch let's go back to the code and uh else if label equals what was it laugh i don't even remember laugh fade equals 255. one more of these this is really painful the way i'm doing this left fade is greater than zero tint by the laugh aid the laugh fate fade goes down and the image is the laugh so i just need variables for that one laugh and did i call it laugh funny i called it funny so only if the label is funny and i had a mistake there anyway okay let's take a look at this i have a question yes no whoops but i love you okay i think that should be bigger and in the center also uh so let's just quickly ah know what i do i can't get my code back there it is um and how do i make it bigger let's just make it oh it's a square so let's just make it 720 by 720. um and then uh because i've done something awful um let's just say image mode corner for everything else except for this one there's nothing after it okay that should work i feel confident let's hit stop let's do share let's go to present let's go here we've got it open and now i can go back to open broadcast studio i think i moved my laptop come on little heart i love you where are you i love you what happened to the love i i want to make i want to make the love animation appear did something go wrong fail to load the resource oh element play oh so the video won't play because i haven't interacted on the page okay i have a this is super annoying um i am going to fix that by saying this um ah i oh i got it i got it i mean this is quite a hack but i'm just gonna force myself to press the mouse to play that video because then i'm interacting with it okay there we go there we go okay now back to obs what's going on here why is my camera so like weird resolution wise now hold on okay so these are working color is all weird but let me add my camera again video capture device why does this disappear i'm doing it again and again okay uh i could debounce this a little bit better okay use your official uh use your official coding train gifts yeah okay um now it is time to go to my zoom meeting oh it is just time for my zoom meeting would it be great if i had an actual zoom meeting to go to and i could log in right now and unsuspectedly the people joining would see this i'm going to use this later today when i have some meetings so i'm going to go to a meeting now me join my meeting oh i didn't start the yes yes okay so one thing i forgot is i've got to go to up to here tools start virtual camera i need to make sure the browser is actually open to this page now i can go to my meeting i can start my camera i can check like i'm on the virtual camera now here we are hello everybody welcome to today's lesson i have a question i really can't smile right smile that comes up serious question oh it's reversed again when did that happen so confusing oh i can flip it in ob i'm so confused about the flipping let's unflip it i guess i have a question yes but i love you let me do what i meant to do this whole time by the way and i'm going to do this now is i'm going to start recording so this is going to be a separate video feed that if we ever actually do edit this together i could create like put it into a zoom meeting um so now let's go back to zoom and hold on we'll make this i want to make this look well if i minimize that that's a problem will it still work if i minimize it probably not right yeah no that's fine uh it's got to be open somewhere but i could probably drag it off the screen there we go okay so now open up the chat okay i'm trying to make this look like a real meeting which is really ridiculous all right everybody welcome to today's zoom meeting apparently my model if i ever put my mouth thinks i'm laughing and i have a question for you everyone watching no i don't have i have a question yes uh question oh the meeting was ended all right you get the idea let's try that one more time that's where you can by the way see the meeting id and the password to try to join see it is there just to finish this off what happens if i leave all right so this is my demonstration of annotating your zoom video based on uh image classification using teachable machine i did this coding challenge i got a lot of work to do on training my model and debouncing the various popups but we can see that i can one ask a question i can say yes i can say no i can say i love love you yes i love you we all love each other and then i can laugh all right so i could add more things like say goodbye or if i leave i could put something else up there's all sorts of possibilities um i i hope that you can follow this i hope that you can really be more thoughtful about the design and animation and to be honest like there is nothing you couldn't possibly put um you don't have to just layer over your video you could play something else or do a full screen gif there's so many possibilities and all you need to do if you want to use this exact example is just go to this particular url but before you do that actually sorry before you do that you if you if you want to use this exact example all you need to go all you need to do is open the url to this particular p5 sketch you do need to train your own model your model should have exactly the same labels everything that i've done here but you should train it with your own images test it to make sure it works then copy paste your model url into this line of code at the top um and then once you do that once you hit run you should see and you've got then run and click the mouse you should see your video down here and your gesture should be able to control these popups now what i would encourage you to do is come up with your own labels and gestures and maybe use objects like what happens when you show it a train whistle or some other object think about what you're actually showing your own images or their animations or you know are can you play pom over yourself like while you're in a zoo meeting uh could you scroll text by you text to speech i would also encourage you to think about accessibility are there ways that you could send audio to zoom um in the sense that instead like when you're laughing it would play a laughing sound effect or when you have a question it would say question or or play a ding um so that for especially for people who might not be able to see the zoom meeting could they experience this result with uh um with audio so if you make anything like that um you know please share with me write a blog post a medium post create a github read me page um because this uh um and and make a web page for it and share it um based on the instructions that you'll find um in this video's description that show you how to add it as a community contribution to the web page for this coding challenge i hope you enjoyed it um i there's probably a million other ways you could do this better than what i did i hope this inspired you thank you i i have to thank um cameron hunter um thank you especially to cameron hunter who where i got this idea from it's not an original idea of mine i just had a lot of fun trying to make this um one thing you'll notice also in his particular example is a lot of the annotations do follow him so yeah you can see how the haha is like moving around and that's something you could also do by adding pose net to this and keeping track of where your nose there's so many things you can do i have to stop talking i have to say goodbye i hope you enjoyed this coding challenge mwah see you soon all right now i pray that all my recording to disc worked uh i'm going to stop this recording to disc um and yeah uh i gotta go 1101. oh perfect timing okay everyone so let me hit stop record uh stop record stop record um i'm still live streaming um i don't not set up with like music and all the other stuff i usually have to do an outro again typically my side project saturdays are the live streams that i'm doing from home um i kind of want to work on this more maybe in a side project saturday so we can add that to the list um so i will see you a week from tomorrow and if you want to join as a member uh we'll see you a week from today hopefully next friday that will be i will get to those ml5 tutorial videos that i also meant to do today but clearly all i got to was make this a particular project which i i did really quite enjoy i hope you enjoyed it and i'm really just going to say goodbye uh i'm going to go out in silence but i'm going to put my little end screen on here oh and i don't have the chat or anything up and i will see you all soon um yeah all right everyone uh have fun with your day i would say give somebody a hug but you can't um be safe consider others i'm going to leave this recording studio i'm going to wash my hands several times go pick up my daughter who had uh in person school today lucky that she can have that today and um stay tuned for the coding challenge video edited video if it recorded a disc if not then this just it is what it is forever for all time um okay how do what i press i press this that's the goodbye screen hopefully you can still hear me but i'm going to press a button that's going to mute my microphone now and i will see you next week you
