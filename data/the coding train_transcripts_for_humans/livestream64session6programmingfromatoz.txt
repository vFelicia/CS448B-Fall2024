00:03 - hello welcome I am live once again uh
00:06 - Dan schiffman here live from the school
00:08 - for poetic computation in the West
00:10 - Village of New York City uh hopefully
00:13 - you can see me and hear me I've got some
00:15 - music playing in the background little
00:17 - opening music I don't have the
00:19 - opening
00:20 - trailer promo video Whatever thing which
00:23 - I will discuss a bit about in a moment
00:26 - uh I want to make sure things seem to be
00:28 - working so let me know in the chat
00:30 - and um it's about uh 1:15 p.m. on a
00:34 - eastern time on a Tuesday in New York
00:36 - City a beautiful sunny day but I'm here
00:39 - in a cave with some hot lights and some
00:41 - cameras pointed at me and a green wall
00:44 - behind me to talk to you about
00:45 - programming and coding and rainbows and
00:47 - unicorns and joyfulness and all sorts of
00:50 - things like that
00:52 - um so let's see what so what's happening
00:55 - today um who Am I who are you where are
00:59 - we why are we here
01:01 - all that sort of stuff so I said before
01:03 - my name is Dan I do a weekly live stream
01:06 - um around creative coding topics um I
01:09 - like to think that this is uh
01:10 - programming to make useless playful
01:13 - experiments um and I hope you enjoy some
01:16 - get something out of it I hope you learn
01:17 - something and I hope you contribute to a
01:19 - community and open source of people also
01:21 - being creative with code and I hope you
01:23 - will consider being inclusive and
01:25 - bringing in people from everywhere into
01:27 - this world of creativity and coding
01:30 - so um if you want to sign up for Stuff
01:33 - um you can subscribe to this channel I
01:35 - don't know where you're watching this
01:36 - there's probably a button somewhere
01:37 - maybe like down here I think there's a
01:38 - button over there where you can
01:40 - subscribe to this channel um you can
01:42 - stay tuned to my Twitter feed shiffman
01:44 - and if you go to coding rainbow.com uh
01:47 - the URL will likely change soon which I
01:49 - will also uh talk about but if uh
01:51 - currently if you go to coding
01:52 - rainbow.com there you can uh sign up for
01:56 - an email list where I send out
01:58 - announcements uh when I'm going to do
02:00 - live streams as well as uh if you feel
02:03 - so inclined you can support my channel
02:04 - on patreon and be subscribed to a slack
02:08 - Channel okay so um let's see what I
02:13 - think that's most of my introductory
02:15 - nonsense stuff that I'm trying to think
02:17 - if I forgot anything so let me talk a
02:19 - couple things first about the time and
02:21 - topic of today so the topic for today
02:25 - is oh no no I I need like applause I
02:28 - don't have Applause I really got work on
02:30 - my sound effects that's the only like
02:31 - sound effect I have so it just goes with
02:34 - everything uh I also have this power um
02:39 - the uh topic for today is marov chains
02:42 - uh is that it is are marov chains is a
02:44 - marov chain this is the topic Markov
02:46 - chains but there's a lot that goes into
02:48 - that there's some stuff about
02:50 - object-oriented programming in
02:51 - JavaScript there's some stuff about
02:53 - looking at text in terms of something
02:54 - called an NR there's something about
02:57 - probability and using arrays and the
02:59 - random function function But ultimately
03:01 - by the end of today I will have built I
03:03 - will I would like to by the end of today
03:05 - have built from scratch a Markov chain
03:08 - generator to generate text based on
03:11 - existing Source texts so I'm going to go
03:13 - through all the pieces of that and talk
03:15 - to you about what a marov chain is and
03:17 - how you can program one and make some
03:19 - experiments now the timing is
03:22 - fortuitous because I I happen to need a
03:24 - new name for this channel now previously
03:26 - I called this channel a coding rainbow
03:28 - it's a name that I adore
03:30 - and love for a number of reasons um
03:33 - number one it's sort of like a happy
03:35 - name I love
03:36 - rainbows uh it's an homage to uh Reading
03:39 - Rainbow which is a children's 80s
03:41 - children's television show and I think
03:43 - it's currently an app about reading and
03:44 - literacy when they're do wonderful
03:46 - wonderful work um it sounds inclusive
03:50 - meaning it's something for everybody and
03:52 - it doesn't sound too serious and it
03:54 - doesn't sound too Technical and so I'm
03:57 - looking uh to at least at the very least
03:59 - keep the rainbow Taste the rainbow
04:01 - whoops that's that's like a skittles
04:03 - reference or something I think um and um
04:06 - but I do need a new name unfortunately
04:08 - due to a trademark uh issue but you know
04:12 - I'm still can't stop me in my
04:16 - Rainbows are people still am I still in
04:18 - this live stream I don't see anything
04:20 - going on in the chat I think I still am
04:22 - there okay so I do need a new name and
04:26 - I've been taking suggestions so if you
04:28 - first of all if you have a suggestion
04:30 - this is like the worst URL ever if
04:32 - somebody could post this if you guys are
04:34 - listening to me please just post
04:35 - something in the chat because I don't
04:36 - see any messages ah okay no no we're
04:39 - here we sing okay um so um you can go to
04:42 - this form and you can submit a name
04:44 - suggestion and since the topic is
04:46 - unfortunately I need somebody figure out
04:48 - get me some rainbow uh sweaters or
04:52 - headbands or t-shirts or something that
04:55 - doesn't have green in it because I got
04:57 - this green screen wall so it doesn't
04:58 - work um
05:00 - but I want it's it's fortuitous timing
05:02 - because the algorithm that I want to
05:03 - look up today is something to generate
05:06 - text and what better example to use to
05:09 - generate text than to generate a new
05:11 - name for this uh YouTube channel um by
05:14 - the way just um as a matter of reference
05:16 - I've posted a couple tweets and I've
05:18 - gotten a lot of feedback right now it
05:20 - seems what's
05:21 - leading is the joy of coding now you
05:24 - might think like Oh no you're GNA have
05:27 - the same problem because there is The
05:29 - Joy of Painting a very a famous uh PB
05:33 - also PBS uh show about painting starring
05:35 - Bob Ross who is a well-known wonderful
05:39 - person who made a wonderful show uh and
05:42 - I like to think of him as an inspiration
05:44 - and a model for this thing that I'm
05:45 - doing on YouTube um there is also
05:49 - however the joy of cooking which I kind
05:50 - of think of this more alike like I'm
05:52 - cooking you got to get the ingredients
05:54 - and put everything together and then
05:55 - Bing comes out of the oven and here's
05:56 - the little like marov chain text
05:58 - generator so but but from what I
06:00 - understand speaking with getting some
06:01 - legal advice is that the joy of phrase
06:04 - is too generic to be trademarked and as
06:07 - long as I don't appropriate any symbols
06:10 - or logo um or otherwise things too
06:13 - similar to an existing something that I
06:16 - would likely be okay now the issue with
06:18 - the joy of coding is that there there's
06:19 - a Wonder there's a conference um out of
06:20 - Europe called Joy of coding there are a
06:22 - couple other like online platforms or
06:25 - YouTube streams that have that
06:26 - terminology in them so I don't know oh
06:29 - there's a problem with the mic
06:31 - okay and I was just talking and
06:36 - talking uh fix the
06:39 - mic okay I don't know what to do here
06:42 - let's try turning it
06:46 - off line first to wake her up sure okay
06:50 - all right Mercy just say the line on the
06:52 - action CU right then wake up here we go
06:55 - rolling
06:58 - please
07:02 - here we go settle
07:05 - and oh sorry I did the static thing
07:08 - again
07:16 - crap is it
07:20 - better there's someone else on the mic
07:23 - Channel that's
07:28 - hilarious
07:31 - I just want to know if it's fixed
07:37 - now it is better yeah
07:40 - okay sorry about that awful sound thing
07:44 - um okay so I'm back what where did I
07:46 - last leave off
07:48 - everybody what was the last thing I said
07:52 - was I talking about the joy of
07:58 - coding
08:03 - okay
08:05 - I I cannot tell what's going
08:08 - on uh in the chat you guys the problem
08:11 - is when you just say yes or no you're 10
08:13 - or 15 seconds behind me and I don't know
08:15 - what you're referring to so if you're
08:16 - answering a question of mine
08:17 - unfortunately you have to say yes it
08:19 - sounds fine or uh yes you were talking
08:22 - about the joy of coding okay yes Joy of
08:25 - coding okay thank you um okay so that's
08:28 - uh leading a uh um possibility for the
08:32 - name of this
08:33 - channel um and we'll see I lost my train
08:37 - of thought I was talking about Bob Ross
08:39 - and how I I can't etc
08:43 - etc
08:46 - uh so when I turned off the mic you
08:48 - heard somebody else okay I got it okay
08:50 - so anyway so the um so I have to figure
08:52 - out what I'm going to do about this you
08:54 - know right now I think this channel is
08:55 - just
08:57 - called Daniel chefman
08:59 - programming or something like that um
09:02 - but uh and I got some I don't need to
09:04 - worry about the point of what I'm doing
09:05 - is making these videos and uh hopefully
09:07 - creating a community of people who are
09:09 - watching these videos and interacting
09:11 - with each other about this sort of stuff
09:13 - I used to have this other light here
09:15 - there we go um and um so I don't know I
09:19 - just turned on another light I don't
09:20 - know if it's better or worse
09:23 - um so um yes so some of you in the chat
09:28 - are asking me more questions about the
09:30 - trademark issues I am very happy to
09:32 - answer those questions static
09:36 - again I'm seeing some of you post static
09:39 - in the chat but I'm a little worried
09:40 - some of you are watching from earlier so
09:44 - um let me know um um but I will be happy
09:48 - to answer those Mike is still Mike is
09:51 - not having is having issues okay um I I
09:54 - I this is too bad this this is a little
09:56 - bit this is quite a bit of fail here
09:58 - what I'm going to do
09:59 - is I am going
10:02 - to change I don't know how to change the
10:05 - mic Channel anybody know how do we
10:08 - really think that's the
10:10 - issue
10:12 - um
10:15 - uh yeah um let me see what I can do here
10:19 - uh one thing is I can do
10:21 - this is that a little
10:24 - better um coding Rambo is a great
10:28 - suggestion um I can try to I'm G to mute
10:33 - myself oh bumping into something maybe
10:37 - it's just
10:38 - [Music]
10:41 - actually alt f4 to change the mic
10:43 - Channel can't hear anything it's fine
10:46 - maybe this the way the mic is on this
10:48 - particular this is a different t-shirt
10:50 - than they usually wear um and it is kind
10:54 - of scratching against oh hold on a
10:56 - second is it better if I hold it out
10:59 - without it being attached to my shirt
11:01 - it's fine when I pick it up so I wonder
11:05 - if there's an issue with the way that it
11:08 - is um yeah it's intermittent let's
11:12 - see where it's attached to my shirt
11:16 - let's
11:17 - see hold on I have an idea have an
11:22 - idea this is riveting hold on let me put
11:25 - all some music for you
11:27 - guys as always I always forget the this
11:30 - do this do this do do this do do do I'm
11:36 - going to
11:45 - [Music]
11:50 - do you guys are giv me great
11:52 - suggestions s
11:54 - [Music]
11:56 - is okay I did turn it down I this this
12:00 - St I did turn it down now I turned it
12:02 - back up um okay so how are things
12:09 - now this this was going so well I had a
12:12 - whole
12:15 - plan
12:17 - um I'm over here looking to see if I can
12:19 - figure out how to change the
12:21 - channel all right everyone's saying it's
12:23 - fine I'm gonna I'm gonna just keep going
12:26 - and hopefully there won't be an issue
12:27 - okay so
12:30 - um let uh oh yeah so does this cause a
12:35 - problem is there static now because I do
12:39 - a lot of
12:40 - this wall sits you know wall sits are a
12:42 - good exercise how long do you think I
12:44 - could do that for it messed up again
12:47 - okay just continue still issue
12:54 - ah okay I'm gonna um I'm GNA keep going
12:57 - for a little bit and I'm going to check
12:59 - in about the mic and see if I can reset
13:01 - things it's static when I move
13:04 - oh static more static over
13:08 - here okay getting a lot of mixed signals
13:11 - from the chat but I have to keep
13:13 - going um okay so um as you guys may be
13:18 - aware I am teaching a course at ITP
13:21 - called programming from a toz um I have
13:25 - been using this fall these weekly
13:27 - sessions which will be on Tuesdays going
13:29 - forward for the time being to cover a
13:31 - lot of topics here and you can
13:33 - see um these are the topics I've covered
13:36 - so far and what I want to add to this
13:39 - list today is Markov chains so
13:45 - um in essence
13:48 - um yeah I slapped my shirt and the noise
13:51 - came it's a fair cage
13:54 - okay have
13:57 - a
13:59 - I do sort of have a backup plan but I
14:01 - guess I'm not g
14:03 - to um okay so what I want to do by the
14:05 - way is I want to First do an
14:07 - introduction to week five uh video so
14:09 - one thing that happens with these
14:10 - sessions is I um with uh the help of
14:14 - Mata um I after the session is over
14:18 - there's as you can see there's a lot of
14:19 - like wasted time I'm trying to fix a
14:21 - microphone um after the sessions over I
14:24 - um edit together
14:26 - some smaller videos that get posted in a
14:29 - playlist if you want usort to follow the
14:30 - sequence of this course
14:33 - okay I'm getting
14:35 - some I'm going to try one more
14:39 - thing other idea let's see how bad it is
14:41 - with
14:43 - this
14:46 - shirt oh
14:48 - [Laughter]
14:50 - yeah this is the other shirt I was
14:52 - wearing today so I was like oh I could
14:55 - just put it
14:57 - on and and then clip the microphone to
15:00 - this this is going to be crazy but let's
15:03 - just see if this even improves
15:06 - it the nice thing about this shirt is
15:08 - it's
15:11 - like clip it to the top of my
15:14 - laptop uh
15:26 - okay now
15:30 - it's actually not as see-through as I
15:32 - thought it might be I don't know if this
15:35 - makes this watching this video way too
15:42 - distracting okay people seem to be
15:44 - enjoying the green shirt okay I'm keying
15:47 - live using a piece of software called
15:49 - wirecast which does the keying for me so
15:52 - I think actually looking over on my
15:53 - preview monitor it's not so bad you know
15:57 - I was using the neck collar
16:00 - but that didn't seem to work when I
16:01 - tried
16:03 - that let's see how's that I can take
16:07 - this shirt back off all right
16:10 - boy I hate these
16:14 - uh this also solves the standing in
16:16 - front of the code problem okay is this
16:19 - better now sound is much better now
16:21 - except I don't know where you are where
16:23 - okay uh where we are in
16:27 - the
16:29 - much much better on the collar awesome
16:31 - I'm glad to hear this okay so the first
16:34 - thing I'm going to do is talk about uh
16:36 - marov chains in general and I want to go
16:40 - to a couple things
16:44 - engrams
16:47 - Google uh oops
16:53 - um so uh where's the link to
16:57 - this
17:00 - uh sorry uh
17:03 - Google engram
17:06 - viewer there we
17:09 - go and
17:12 - rainbow
17:16 - unicorn
17:19 - uh unicorn
17:22 - rainbows
17:24 - uh Happy
17:27 - rainbows
17:29 - flying
17:32 - unicorns no valid
17:35 - engrams
17:42 - I uh I'm now I'm worried I'm There's
17:46 - issues again with the
17:49 - sound um okay
17:56 - uh it's fine now okay
18:02 - um
18:12 - uh okay power through um okay um okay so
18:17 - I'm sorry I'm trying to think of some
18:19 - phrases that would be relevant to uh
18:22 - have in this engram
18:25 - viewer
18:27 - um
18:28 - [Music]
18:32 - uh
18:35 - rainbow
18:39 - uh sorry I'm like so distracted by the
18:43 - uh sound
18:44 - problems um and I just keep like looking
18:47 - at the chat trying to figure out if it's
18:48 - good or not but I'm gonna I'm gonna
18:50 - power through for a little bit here okay
18:56 - um uh Happy
18:59 - code
19:01 - uh joyful
19:06 - code let's just do computer
19:09 - science creative code
19:13 - creative
19:15 - writing okay that sort of works
19:18 - um okay um okay so this is one thing I
19:21 - want to have
19:23 - open um sorry I'm getting myself set up
19:26 - here this is not
19:29 - my
19:30 - best uh let me look uh here for a couple
19:35 - other examples of things that were
19:38 - relevant uh this is one that I want to
19:40 - look at and this is one I want to look
19:44 - at um look at also this ITP course
19:50 - generator okay
19:56 - so and
20:02 - Harrison oh
20:05 - yeah this is good to see sorry
20:09 - everyone as always I always forget the
20:21 - this okay um so I'm ready for so what I
20:24 - want to do quickly is introduce this
20:26 - idea of a marov chain um and uh an
20:31 - engram and
20:34 - um um talk about the sort of
20:40 - overall content for this week then I am
20:44 - going
20:45 - to
20:47 - um then I am going to do a coding
20:49 - challenge where I program the Markov
20:51 - chain and then I will wrap up with some
20:52 - exercise ideas
20:55 - okay and so here we go everybody
21:01 - um
21:03 - okay sometimes I like to have these
21:05 - little musical
21:09 - bumpers hello uh this is programming
21:12 - from A to Z week
21:15 - seven I don't know what week I'm on hold
21:18 - on a second let's look
21:20 - here
21:23 - uh um session something or other uh this
21:27 - is my programming from a toz playlists
21:29 - uh week six so it's week seven um just
21:32 - in case you're trying to figure out
21:33 - where we are week one was an
21:35 - introduction week two is regular
21:37 - Expressions week three is libraries and
21:40 - uh apis week four was looking at node
21:44 - and twitterbots and week five text
21:46 - analysis and word counting ah I forgot
21:49 - to do so one of the things I try to do
21:50 - is I try to collect things that people
21:52 - are working on and show them at the
21:54 - beginning of the live stream and somehow
21:55 - I've forgotten to do that yet again so
21:57 - I'm really going to have have to commit
21:58 - to doing that next week okay so week
22:00 - session six I'm going to call it
22:03 - okay
22:09 - um hello welcome to session six or week
22:13 - six I don't know you doing this every
22:15 - day every week every month this could be
22:16 - year six for you if you wanted it to be
22:18 - but this is programming from A to Z it's
22:21 - a set of tutorials a kind of online
22:23 - course you could follow all about
22:25 - programming and algorithms with text
22:28 - text language text Words letters all
22:31 - that sort of stuff so um today uh in
22:34 - this week's session um the focus um will
22:39 - be about uh the focus that I want to
22:41 - have is markof chains whoa what's a
22:43 - markof chain what's what's a deal what's
22:44 - going on so in the last session um I
22:47 - focused on something uh the sort of
22:49 - topic of text analysis so in last week
22:52 - the idea was really exclusively about
22:54 - reading text in and analyze it analyzing
22:57 - it counting how many times different
22:58 - words appear uh trying to think about
23:01 - how you might do sentiment analysis what
23:03 - happens when a computer program reads in
23:05 - text I want to turn now towards what
23:07 - happens when a computer program writes
23:10 - its own text and there of course are
23:12 - many many ways that you could do this in
23:14 - next week's session I'm going to look at
23:15 - something called a context free grammar
23:18 - um in other sessions I hope to look at
23:19 - some machine learning techniques for
23:21 - generating text as well as other just
23:23 - kind of creative ideas for ways to mix
23:25 - and match and have a program put
23:27 - together text as if it's reading it now
23:29 - one thing I should say about this week's
23:30 - topic of marov chains is it by
23:33 - definition requires a source text from
23:37 - which to generate text so this is
23:39 - something you'll see in a lot of these
23:40 - algorithms for generating text they also
23:43 - include a reading text component so um
23:47 - the Markov chain algorithm is based on
23:50 - this idea of an
23:52 - nram
23:56 - whoaa edit
23:58 - mat has been very good at just like
23:59 - doing some jump cuts when I start to say
24:02 - things that don't make any
24:03 - sense and I want to
24:07 - uh have a little like jump cut edit
24:09 - point
24:11 - there
24:15 - um I don't know when I clicked over but
24:18 - I'll just leave it back over
24:20 - here now a marov chain is not something
24:23 - exclusive to the idea of text and in
24:26 - fact a marov chain really just describes
24:28 - a sequence or a chain of States like I
24:32 - am happy I am sad I am running and I
24:36 - might typically on any given day be sad
24:38 - and then I start running and then I feel
24:39 - happy and that's kind of my sequence so
24:42 - what H um with a marov chain looking at
24:45 - how certain states are sequenced and the
24:48 - probability of a given State following
24:50 - another state um we can use we can
24:53 - evaluate sort of existing data right I
24:55 - can look and say like oh you know what's
24:57 - the the weather like today what's the
24:58 - weather like tomorrow what's the weather
24:59 - like the next day over a year and try to
25:02 - use that to either predict the new
25:04 - weather or to recreate a simulation of
25:07 - weather based on the sequence of States
25:09 - so this is something I'll look at more
25:11 - in more detail in the next um video but
25:13 - there's a piece of that which is if I
25:16 - want to apply this idea of a marov chain
25:18 - to text what I want is for the
25:21 - characters are words of a piece of text
25:24 - to be States for example the state is I
25:27 - I the next state is M the next state is
25:30 - feeling the next state is like dancing
25:33 - so those are states and the you know
25:35 - whenever I say am I usually say feeling
25:37 - and then whenever I say feeling I
25:38 - usually say like you know but I might
25:40 - say the other day I I'm feeling like
25:42 - eating
25:43 - some kale salad or something like that
25:45 - too so this is this is like quite
25:47 - possibly the worst explanation of markup
25:49 - chains ever on the internet but uh you
25:51 - can skip to the next video where I'm
25:53 - sure it will make a lot of sense but um
25:55 - a piece of of evaluating the statistical
25:57 - properties of characters and words how
25:59 - they appear next to each other is this
26:01 - idea of an engram so this will also be a
26:04 - piece of the example that I buil today
26:06 - of how do we look at a body of text and
26:08 - look at this idea of engrams now Google
26:11 - has this massive Treasure Trove
26:14 - repository of Text corpus of text from
26:17 - you know 1800 all the way up until
26:19 - present day and you can search for the
26:21 - frequency of certain NRS so these are
26:24 - what it might be called byrs meaning two
26:27 - computer science creative code creative
26:30 - writing we could think of other ones
26:32 - like I am and I could search for any of
26:37 - these uh diagrams and their frequency in
26:40 - text and we can see that computer you
26:42 - can see first of all computer signs
26:43 - started to appear more and more
26:45 - frequently in starting the 1960s you can
26:48 - see a sort of more consistent amount of
26:49 - I you can see creative writing creative
26:52 - code down here so this is a way of
26:56 - looking at um how how and we can look at
26:59 - trigrams engrams with an order right an
27:02 - order of four the order referring to the
27:05 - number um and uh you can do creative
27:09 - projects with this so here's a great
27:11 - project by Chris Harrison called Web
27:13 - trigrams visualizing Google's triam data
27:17 - and we can see here if we just look at
27:20 - this uh PDF and I'm going to zoom into
27:22 - it so you can see you can see here that
27:26 - that uh in this project
27:28 - the uh Chris is visualizing all the
27:31 - words that tend to follow he and then
27:34 - from there all the words that tend to
27:35 - follow that so um another I think this
27:38 - these are some nice examples to look at
27:40 - and you can kind of here imagine now um
27:43 - I have a I am not I was not I do not I
27:48 - can a so you can sort of see the
27:50 - frequencies of these sequences and if
27:52 - you can evaluate those frequencies you
27:55 - can use those frequencies as
27:56 - probabilities from which to generate new
27:58 - text so here's an example of um a
28:02 - project made by Allison Parish uh the
28:04 - interactive telecommunications program
28:06 - is a program at ITP it's called it a
28:08 - program at ITP it is ITP it's where I
28:11 - teach um and we have courses Every
28:14 - Spring and what Allison did is read all
28:17 - of the courses into a program look at
28:20 - all the statistical properties of all
28:23 - the characters and words and how they
28:24 - appear next to each other and use that
28:27 - to generate new uh new courses so I'm
28:30 - going to um let's let's let's find one
28:33 - uh that that looks good
28:36 - uh the anthropologies of virtual design
28:39 - Workshop midi and cinematic objects this
28:41 - course constraints of weekly sessions
28:43 - Beyond exercises and Inspire the
28:46 - possible so um this sounds great I think
28:50 - I'll take that course um this is another
28:52 - example of a project um called King
28:55 - James programming and these are post
28:58 - generated by a Markov chain that has
29:00 - mixed several different input texts uh
29:03 - the King James Bi Bible structured
29:05 - interpretation of computer programs and
29:06 - some of Eric s Raymond's writings run by
29:09 - Michael Walker so you can see here these
29:11 - are uh different um things that are
29:14 - generated from that exercise 3.67
29:16 - addresses why we want a local variable
29:18 - rather than a simple map as in the days
29:20 - of Herod the king okay so um there's a
29:24 - lot of possibilities for how you might
29:27 - use marov chains to for Creative output
29:31 - and on the one hand this is nothing new
29:33 - this has been done and done and done and
29:36 - done again this idea of reading in a
29:38 - source text evaluate the probabilities
29:40 - on a character or word based level and
29:42 - I'll talk about that as I implement the
29:43 - code in the next video and then text
29:45 - generating out of that you could make a
29:47 - Twitter bot that generates text based on
29:48 - a Markov chain so I I think there's
29:51 - value and hopefully you might enjoy
29:53 - exploring the idea and you might even
29:54 - just take the examples that I provide
29:56 - and find your own source text in but I
29:59 - think for you to think about what is the
30:01 - reason why you might do this where might
30:02 - it fit into an existing project I hear a
30:06 - walkie-talkie I
30:08 - want um and um um and come up with some
30:12 - creative possibilities so in the next
30:14 - video I'm going to focus on the code how
30:17 - to write the code to implement a Markov
30:19 - generator I'm going to go through it
30:21 - entirely from scratch I'm and then I'm
30:24 - going to show you a few additional
30:25 - examples and then come back with some
30:27 - exercise ideas for things that you might
30:30 - want to try doing yourself after
30:32 - watching these videos and then I hope
30:33 - you'll share them with me on Twitter at
30:35 - shiffman or you can subscribe to the
30:37 - patreon to um to uh post the post your
30:40 - work in slack as well okay so um I will
30:45 - uh see you guys in the next
30:47 - video how is the sound on that
30:54 - everybody um the thing is I felt like
30:56 - that was kind of terrible
30:57 - but I I've been wanting what I thought
30:59 - would be useful was to have introductory
31:03 - videos for each week's session I need to
31:05 - go back and do um other ones uh for like
31:10 - the earlier weeks there sessions that I
31:11 - didn't do yet
31:13 - but whatever that'll have to do for now
31:15 - so
31:17 - um uh you know part of this is that I
31:20 - actually just did all this stuff this
31:21 - morning ITP in a class and it's like in
31:24 - a way I should be like this should be
31:25 - good because I practice it now I have a
31:26 - sense of what to do but I I I think that
31:29 - I lost my sort of spontaneous thing
31:32 - static made it a little bit bad a bit
31:35 - glitchy on occasion is it really I have
31:37 - another microphone I'm tempted to just
31:40 - use the other microphone let's see how
31:42 - that
31:43 - goes so hold on
31:48 - everybody um
31:52 - okay I'm going to try switching to a
31:55 - different microphone I'm muting this
32:26 - one
32:33 - so this is random this is noise pearly
32:35 - noise that is in the core random
32:38 - algorithm the actual random algorithm
32:40 - itself those numbers aren't related at
32:43 - all you pick like I'm picking random
32:45 - numbers between Z and 10 9 2 7 6 1 9 4 8
32:51 - nine two one three I pick nine a lot
32:53 - apparently but with pear and noise I
32:55 - might pick numbers like this two three
32:58 - four three four five six five four five
33:02 - six seven five six seven five six S8 N8
33:06 - s six this is
33:12 - like test test okay I'm now using a
33:15 - different
33:17 - microphone uh and you guys can tell me
33:19 - it's this is not theoretically not as
33:21 - nice a
33:22 - microphone but
33:25 - um hopefully it will work um is
33:29 - everything okay I
33:34 - hear sound is low that's no oh sound is
33:37 - low okay sorry about that now I have a
33:40 - different microphone I forgot that I
33:41 - turned the volume all the way down so in
33:43 - case I didn't um in case I uh
33:48 - um some like bad horrible thing happened
33:51 - okay good good check good okay a lot
33:55 - better all right so I'm going to use
33:56 - this other microphone now we'll see if
33:58 - the static comes
33:59 - back uh hopefully that's going to do the
34:02 - trick I'll put the um pearing noise song
34:07 - back on so this is random this is this
34:09 - is by Loop that is
34:11 - theand algorithm the actual random
34:14 - algorithm itself those numbers aren't
34:17 - related at all you pick like I'm picking
34:19 - random numbers between 0 and 10 2 I'm
34:22 - going to get set up to do the first
34:24 - coding shower 9 2 one three I picked
34:27 - nine a lot apparently but with pear and
34:29 - noise I might pick numbers like
34:32 - this four five
34:39 - six week six even though it's the
34:41 - seventh
34:42 - week per I'm going to do my ridiculous
34:46 - thing this is how I like to do it I like
34:48 - to download P5 JS every single
34:53 - time and then I like to go to the empty
34:56 - exam exle I put it in here and I like to
35:00 - say
35:01 - marov
35:03 - chain
35:05 - and now I want to open up
35:15 - terminal no that is this is that is is
35:19 - no that is so this isur noise that is
35:22 - noise noise that is noise so this isur
35:25 - noise that is noise
35:27 - noise that is so this is noise that
35:34 - is I'm in the
35:36 - wrong sorry
35:43 - everybody sorry everybody but with pear
35:47 - noise I might pick numbers like
35:55 - this
36:03 - we go this is like pear noise
36:06 - performance
36:07 - art okay we are getting closer
36:10 - now to looking at marov
36:14 - chains now I just need to open up the
36:18 - code um let me run at it let me find the
36:23 - code uh A to Z weeks six let's put this
36:29 - here um let's put this
36:34 - here oh Andrew I see you in the chat I
36:37 - didn't respond to your tweet yet but I
36:38 - will thumbs up I think that um so thank
36:41 - you for your help and I will respond to
36:44 - you
36:47 - uh update is ready okay guess I'll
36:50 - install the
36:52 - update uh go here I need the
36:58 - Library uh
37:00 - and okay sorry for all this this has
37:03 - really been quite slow where are we at
37:04 - now 37 minutes you guys are very patient
37:08 - I probably lost a ton of viewers with
37:09 - all this wasted time audio is still good
37:12 - I assume yes okay
37:18 - so I'm ready so this is the one thing
37:20 - that I'm trying to think about here is
37:24 - um is um
37:27 - I
37:29 - um I let's see what am I thinking about
37:32 - here I uh in some what I have been doing
37:35 - typically I'm looking for my whiteboard
37:37 - markers seem to have lost
37:40 - them oh they're over here I have
37:45 - typically um thought of tried to do
37:49 - shorter videos and many of them as
37:52 - opposed to one longer one and so I'm
37:55 - tempted to just do one video which shows
37:58 - you how to generate a list of all of the
38:02 - engrs in a piece of
38:04 - text and then follow that up with a
38:07 - video that does a Markov chain so in
38:10 - that sense it would be two parts but I
38:13 - am ALS and on the one hand I'm also
38:14 - tempted to just do the whole thing
38:16 - because it's kind of a single project um
38:20 - and so I don't know what to do but I
38:25 - think what I'm going to do is play by
38:27 - ear so I'm going to start this is going
38:29 - to be completed in two parts I'm going
38:32 - to discuss what a Markoff chain is what
38:35 - an NR is and then I am going to
38:41 - um and then I am going
38:45 - to uh implement the code for all of the
38:48 - above okay sorry uh if I'm a little bit
38:52 - quiet I am a little quieter than I was
38:53 - before I'm turning it up a tiny bit um
38:57 - okay uh so one thing I want to look up
39:00 - and I know the camera just went off I'm
39:04 - just uh want to go to this
39:12 - website so I want to just reference here
39:15 - very briefly at the beginning this
39:17 - wonderful article by uh Victor Powell
39:21 - which uh explains Markov chains visually
39:24 - through a set of animations so I'm not
39:26 - going to use this in my video I don't I
39:28 - want to feel like I'm appropriating this
39:31 - content um but I'm going to I'll put a
39:33 - link to it in the video's description
39:35 - and uh I wanted to plug it because this
39:38 - helped me really think about and
39:39 - understand Markov chains in a nice way
39:41 - um okay so here we go now it's time it's
39:46 - at what it's two o'clock I have about an
39:48 - hour so I have an hour to do this coding
39:50 - challenge so the video in the end will
39:52 - be somewhere between 20 minutes and an
39:53 - hour and we'll see so here we go um and
39:56 - I'm going to cycle this other
39:58 - camera and we're going to get
40:06 - started so I'm trying to think of I'll
40:09 - just leave it over
40:10 - here
40:12 - um
40:15 - okay here we
40:23 - go hello welcome to a another coding
40:26 - challenge this coding challenge is part
40:28 - of the programming from a toz course
40:31 - which is all about programming uh with
40:33 - text and so in this coding challenge I
40:35 - am going to implement from scratch a
40:37 - marov generator so I need to talk about
40:39 - what a this thing called an engram is I
40:42 - need to talk about what a marov chain is
40:44 - and then how I use a marov chain to
40:46 - generate text so I'm going to do all
40:48 - that and write the code from it in
40:49 - JavaScript from scratch in this video
40:51 - one thing I want to just plug or
40:52 - reference is this wonderful article
40:54 - online by Victor Powell marov chains
40:57 - visually explained if you're looking for
40:59 - a supplemental resource to sort of think
41:01 - about marov chains and how they work
41:03 - this is really terrific and I recommend
41:05 - you check it out so I'm going to come
41:06 - over to the Whiteboard first no I'm
41:10 - coming to empty space it's all black
41:13 - hello am I here yes I'm here I'm coming
41:15 - over to this whiteboard to talk about
41:16 - what a marov chain is so a marov chain
41:21 - is a sequence of States so what could
41:24 - those States be um actually in Victor
41:27 - Po's article uh he references you could
41:30 - think of the states of um a baby playing
41:34 - crying eating sleeping and you could
41:37 - imagine well what's the sort of typical
41:39 - sequence it does the baby first play
41:41 - then the baby eats then the baby sleeps
41:44 - and then the baby cries and that's kind
41:45 - of like a typical sequence but sometimes
41:47 - it happens in other ways right we could
41:49 - kind of boil this all down and make the
41:51 - States you know we could think of sort
41:53 - of this very like in a sort of cold
41:55 - mathematical sense and the states could
41:57 - just be a oh no no no no no this will
42:01 - not do I'll be right
42:08 - back um I think this will be edited out
42:12 - me wandering around here I'm looking for
42:14 - my
42:15 - Eraser I had this nice eraser that
42:18 - actually seems to work well and I've
42:19 - completely lost
42:21 - it
42:23 - um
42:25 - uh oh well I don't know where it is I'm
42:28 - GNA have to just use something else I
42:30 - have a paper towel where could it have
42:33 - gone I'm losing my mind oh thank you you
42:36 - guys can hear me that I'm looking for an
42:38 - eraser look a magical person from the
42:41 - other room brought me this eraser this
42:43 - is amazing oh look I erased okay thank
42:45 - you uh all right so now I have an eraser
42:48 - wow this is this is amazing I should
42:49 - always record with people in the next
42:51 - room listening in okay uh let's try
42:54 - this I could list states as simply
42:58 - letters a b and the idea of a sequence
43:04 - means there is always a transition a
43:07 - moment where the state goes from one
43:09 - state to another so we could think about
43:11 - here that ah a could become b or maybe a
43:17 - could stay as a and b could become
43:21 - a or b could stay as B so if these are
43:28 - all the possible states and their
43:31 - transition to another state and we said
43:34 - that there is a 50% chance of this
43:37 - happening or a 50% chance of this
43:40 - happening or a 50% chance of this
43:43 - happening or a 50% chance of this
43:45 - happening we could then create a
43:47 - sequence that matches these
43:49 - probabilities I could say start with a I
43:52 - could flip a coin heads it's a I could
43:55 - flip a coin heads it's a I could flip a
43:58 - coin Tails it's B I could flip a coin
44:01 - heads it's a I could flip a coin Tails
44:04 - it's B right so this idea here is that I
44:07 - am generating that sequence of States
44:09 - based on existing States and probability
44:13 - of an outcome after that so this is used
44:16 - for a lot of different kinds of systems
44:19 - you could imagine looking at financial
44:21 - data as a sequence of States scientific
44:24 - data weather patterns predicting an
44:26 - earthquake based on some set of sensor
44:29 - readings uh in and how they sequence
44:31 - that's this sort of thing so Markoff
44:33 - chains are used in a variety of fields
44:35 - to analyze a sequence of states and also
44:39 - generate or predict outcomes based on
44:41 - that sequence now what I want to use
44:44 - them for in this video is to think of
44:46 - text as a sequence of States so let's
44:49 - say I wrote the
44:52 - sentence this rainbow
44:57 - has a
45:00 - unicorn
45:02 - flying over
45:05 - it so on the one hand I could think of
45:09 - each character as a state so how many
45:12 - possible states are there well maybe
45:13 - there's 26 lowercase characters 26
45:16 - uppercase characters different kinds of
45:19 - punctuation and I could say the state is
45:22 - T followed by H followed by I followed
45:26 - by S right followed by space followed by
45:28 - R followed by a followed by I right so I
45:30 - could think of this as a sequence of
45:32 - states on the Character level I could
45:34 - also think of this as a sequence of
45:36 - states on the word level well maybe
45:38 - there are however many tens of thousands
45:40 - or hundreds of thousands of words in an
45:42 - in the English language each one of
45:44 - those could be a state the state is this
45:46 - followed by rainbow followed by has
45:49 - followed by a now in a small Corpus in a
45:52 - small Source text I won't see that many
45:55 - possibilities the word rainbow is the
45:57 - only word that ever follows this but if
46:00 - I were to evaluate a large body of text
46:03 - I would see this followed by rainbow
46:07 - followed by unicorn followed by this dot
46:10 - for JavaScript programming right and I
46:13 - might be able to say you know what comes
46:14 - after this a lot this rainbow and I
46:18 - could start to adjust these
46:20 - probabilities based on an existing
46:22 - Source text and this is the idea if we
46:25 - can read in a text look at what kinds of
46:28 - characters come after a given character
46:30 - and how frequently I can start to
46:32 - generate a text based on those
46:34 - probabilities but there's one more
46:36 - element to this right now I'm talking
46:38 - about just each state being a single
46:41 - character or each state being a single
46:43 - word but there is a concept I don't know
46:46 - why I'm coming over here I thought I had
46:47 - something for
46:49 - this there is a con don't have anything
46:51 - for this over here there is a concept
46:54 - known as an nram
46:57 - an
46:58 - NR being a contiguous sequence of
47:04 - characters or words a continuous
47:05 - sequence of text and an engram has
47:09 - something associated with it called an
47:12 - order we could say byrs being NRS of two
47:16 - or trigrs being NRS of three and when I
47:19 - say that I mean let's look at all of the
47:22 - trigrams in this particular sentence
47:26 - this rainbow has a unicorn here's a
47:28 - trigram th hii the next trigram is h i s
47:33 - the next trigram is I space I'm doing an
47:37 - underscore for space the next trigram is
47:40 - sore R so what I could do is actually
47:44 - consider the states not to be single
47:47 - characters not to be single words but
47:51 - byrams are trigrams are engrams with an
47:53 - order of four or five or six in other
47:55 - words I could say if the state is th thi
47:59 - what are all the possible characters
48:02 - that could follow that so what I want to
48:04 - do is read in a text make a list of all
48:06 - of the engrams in that text let's just
48:08 - say an order of three to start with all
48:11 - of the trigrams in that text and then
48:14 - for each triag make a list of all the
48:16 - possible outcomes then I have a
48:18 - statistical model of how the text is put
48:21 - together on a character level and I can
48:23 - use that statistical model to generate
48:25 - new text with those same probabilities
48:28 - and properties so this is what I'm going
48:29 - to start to build right now and uh the
48:32 - the I'm going to build it on the
48:34 - Character level and maybe I'll do a
48:35 - second video where I adjust it to to to
48:37 - work on the word
48:41 - level
48:43 - okay um here we go U this can be an edit
48:46 - point for Matthew I just want to make
48:47 - sure everything's working okay because I
48:50 - had sound issues before and I kind of
48:52 - went on for a while uh it was a unicorn
48:55 - Dan writing off view oh did I write
48:58 - stuff out of the view of the
49:00 - camera
49:02 - um how bad was
49:09 - it um sound was great everything was
49:15 - great I uh I'm taking a pause here Mato
49:18 - thank you for editing this together to
49:20 - see if there are any questions Andrew
49:21 - Kim writes I always thought the grams
49:23 - were words as a whole so yes it's
49:26 - typically like if you look at the Google
49:28 - book view or engrams it's typically um
49:32 - uh typically uh thought of that way but
49:34 - I'm going to do it on a character level
49:35 - which I think is a little bit more
49:36 - useful okay so I'm going to pretend uh
49:39 - I'm walking back into the other camera
49:41 - and keep
49:44 - going okay so let me do that again and
49:47 - I'm GNA keep
49:50 - going thank you Sasquatch for saying
49:52 - that was a great explanation of the
49:53 - concept I feel like I should just throw
49:55 - away that first video this was much
49:56 - better
49:58 - okay okay so whoops I stepped on
50:01 - something so um let's uh start
50:03 - programming this so I have uh a
50:05 - completely empty uh P5 sketch and I want
50:08 - to start with putting some text at the
50:10 - top where I will say uh this rainbow has
50:14 - a
50:15 - unicorn flying over
50:19 - it and I don't need draw and I don't
50:21 - need a canvas so the first thing I want
50:24 - to do is is simply make a list of all of
50:27 - the trigrams so I'm going to include a
50:30 - variable called order and I'm going to
50:32 - say order equals three and that's
50:34 - something we could adjust if later I
50:36 - want it to be byrs or engrams of order
50:38 - five that sort of thing and I'm going to
50:40 - just Loop through the text so what I
50:43 - first want to do is just look at every
50:44 - single character one at a time um uh
50:48 - text. length i++ and then what I want to
50:53 - do is pull out the trigram
50:55 - so I can see plainly that the first
50:57 - trigram is thi and the way that I can
51:00 - pull out a piece of a string from
51:02 - another string is with the function
51:03 - substring so I'm going to say VAR gram
51:07 - equals text. substring and I could say
51:11 - this right 0 comma 3 would give me thi
51:14 - now you might be wondering the index
51:16 - values are t h i s 0 1 2 3 why doesn't 0
51:22 - comma 3 give me this an important thing
51:24 - to remember is substring the first index
51:27 - is included the last index is excluded
51:30 - so actually 0 comma 3 gives me th I
51:33 - three characters from 0 1 and two which
51:36 - is exactly what I want but I don't
51:38 - actually want to say 0 comma 3 what I
51:40 - want to say is I and
51:42 - i+ three because what I want as I'm
51:45 - looping is thi then h i s then I space
51:48 - then s space r that sort of thing and I
51:51 - can make a variable called n gs and I
51:54 - can make it an AR array and then I can
51:57 - say n gs. pushr and at the end here I
52:01 - can say
52:02 - console.log n GRS so let's run this code
52:05 - and this is just a simple piece of code
52:07 - to give me a list of every trigram in
52:10 - this particular piece of
52:11 - text and we can see there it is I can
52:14 - make this a little bit bigger for you in
52:16 - case you can't see that and you can see
52:17 - there are all those engrams now there's
52:18 - a little bit of a problem notice at the
52:20 - end t period and just period so those
52:23 - aren't trigrams those are just two
52:24 - character than one character that's cuz
52:26 - I let it Loop all the way to the end and
52:28 - I actually want to say uh minus order +
52:32 - one I think or I could just say less
52:34 - than or equal to text. length minus
52:36 - order so that should give me um r space
52:39 - i space it and it period so now we can
52:42 - see there's the list now here's the
52:45 - thing this is not a unique list of only
52:49 - of of the trigrams this is just a list
52:51 - of every single trigram but ultimately
52:54 - what I'm going to want to do and I'm GNA
52:57 - um come back over here is what I want to
53:00 - build is a big
53:02 - table I want to build a table where I
53:05 - have you know trigram ABC points at all
53:09 - the possible things that could come
53:11 - after it and trigram
53:15 - feeg um all of the trigrams that's not
53:18 - the alphabet EFG ABC and I forgot D AB
53:22 - bcde e f all the I know now I'm putting
53:24 - numbers here I got I kind of lost my
53:26 - train of thought there but I want to I
53:29 - want to
53:31 - build I want to build this table so what
53:34 - I need to do is
53:36 - pair a a trigram an engram with an array
53:41 - and guess what remember when I made some
53:43 - video about word counting when you said
53:44 - hey let's pair a string with a count and
53:46 - I used a JavaScript object as a
53:48 - collection of name value pairs we can do
53:50 - exactly this here only the and the name
53:53 - the fields the properties of that
53:55 - JavaScript object are the engrams and
53:57 - instead of having a count with how many
53:59 - times they appear I want to have an
54:00 - array with all the possible outcomes
54:02 - after that so let me come back over here
54:05 - and start implementing that in the code
54:07 - uh okay so um so first instead of having
54:12 - an array of
54:14 - NRS I want to have a
54:18 - um object yes an object and when I find
54:22 - a gram I want to ask
54:26 - does
54:28 - whoops does that gram already exist
54:32 - right if that gram already exists well
54:35 - let's just do a count for right now I
54:37 - could say you know
54:39 - increase um it's
54:43 - count
54:47 - otherwise uh
54:50 - otherwise uh set its count equal to one
54:54 - right if it doesn't exist set its count
54:56 - equal to one if it already exists and
54:58 - you know what I this is kind of silly of
54:59 - me but I feel like it's a little bit
55:00 - more readable if I write it this way
55:04 - right because if it doesn't exist set
55:06 - its count to one if it does exist
55:08 - increase its count so let's go back over
55:10 - here and see what do I get now
55:12 - unfortunately the text that I wrote
55:14 - everything only appears once so what I'm
55:16 - going to do is I'm going to artificially
55:18 - create some text where there's a bunch
55:20 - of uh things that appear multiple times
55:24 - uh so let's try I maybe you guys there
55:26 - there some people watching the live chat
55:27 - can suggest things for me to write so
55:29 - I'll write the
55:32 - theramin is
55:35 - theirs
55:37 - okay yes it is this is a
55:42 - theramin that's like the weirdest
55:45 - sentence but now at the very least if I
55:48 - run this again you can see that certain
55:50 - certain um certain trigrams appear many
55:54 - times like space I is appears three
55:56 - times space t appears four times uh uh
55:59 - this is in alphabetic order t h appears
56:01 - four times s comma space appears twice
56:03 - so we're seeing the frequency of these
56:06 - trigrams these collections of three
56:09 - characters so all I've done so far is
56:13 - make a nice little table which counts
56:14 - how many times the NRS appear but I want
56:17 - boy I want more what I want to do is
56:20 - what I've got over here I want to have
56:24 - um
56:25 - a list of things that come after and
56:27 - what do I mean by after is what's what
56:29 - whenever this trigram appears what's the
56:31 - character that appears after it so if I
56:34 - come back over here what I want to do is
56:36 - when I have found a new gram that I
56:39 - haven't seen before make an array the
56:42 - key the key for this um sorry here the
56:46 - key for this the value for this uh key
56:49 - in the object is an array and then of
56:52 - course what I want to do is put
56:53 - something in that array
56:55 - like the next character and what is the
56:58 - next character the next character is I +
57:00 - 3 push text car at I + 3 right because
57:06 - I'm looking at this sequence of three
57:08 - characters and the one that appears
57:10 - right after it is number is three later
57:14 - and then of course if I have already
57:16 - found it I don't need to make a new
57:19 - array I just need to push that character
57:21 - you can see there's some redundancy here
57:22 - so let's clean up that redundancy I can
57:25 - actually just say if it's not there make
57:26 - an array and then always push that other
57:29 - character in it so let's see what
57:31 - happens now if we look at what I'm
57:33 - storing in data okay look at this now
57:36 - look at this if I go down to
57:38 - th and look at that we can see look what
57:42 - are the possible things so after th I
57:45 - could have a space I could have an r or
57:48 - I could have an i and look at this R
57:51 - appears twice now in some cases when I'm
57:54 - Pro programming I'll see that R
57:55 - appearing twice and think this is not so
57:58 - good there's some redundancy here I
58:00 - should just have R in a count of two we
58:02 - did this for word counting right we
58:04 - didn't want a list of all the words with
58:05 - the words in there multiple times we
58:07 - wanted a list of the unique words and
58:08 - their count but there's something going
58:10 - on here which is that
58:13 - if this is my set of possibilities space
58:17 - r i r r what if I said to you pick one
58:21 - random
58:22 - possibility pick space or or r r or i r
58:26 - r well R is actually going to be picked
58:30 - 50% of the time I only 25% of the time
58:33 - and space only 25% of the time the mere
58:36 - fact that we are
58:38 - duplicating the possibilities over and
58:40 - overg again into the array the more
58:42 - times they appear the more likely
58:44 - they'll get picked when we generate text
58:46 - so this is actually a side effect that
58:48 - of having this redundancy that we
58:50 - actually want so this is really useful
58:52 - you could kind of say like oh this is
58:53 - inefficient it's wasted memory and I
58:55 - could store a number and I could do some
58:57 - other kind of math and all of that is
58:58 - true and I encourage you to go forward
59:01 - and and go forth and make a more compact
59:04 - version of this but the ease of doing it
59:06 - this way and come on these are
59:07 - individual characters think about how
59:08 - your computer stores images of millions
59:11 - of pixels and videos it's not that much
59:12 - of a memory overload there's a question
59:14 - of scalability and how much data you
59:16 - know etc etc but I think we don't need
59:17 - to worry about that right now this is
59:19 - going to work beautifully so let's look
59:21 - at this I'm going to come back over here
59:23 - right now and and we are getting there
59:26 - we have now space r i we have this list
59:29 - of trigrams and the letters that come
59:32 - after it so what I'm going to do now is
59:35 - I am going to build into this I'm gonna
59:38 - I'm going to add some stuff to this
59:39 - example I'm going to create a
59:42 - button uh because I what I want to do is
59:45 - have a button uh equals create button
59:48 - and I'm using some code from the P5 Dom
59:50 - Library which allows me to quickly mock
59:52 - up some interface elements uh and I'll
59:54 - call that gener at and then I'm going to
59:56 - say a button. mous pressed and I'm going
59:58 - to say uh uh Markov
60:03 - it so now I'm going to run the Mark I'm
60:06 - gonna now I need to write an algorithm
60:07 - to generate the
60:10 - text uh and then uh we will say create P
60:15 - the result so right now of course let's
60:17 - just make sure this works right now all
60:19 - I'm getting is the results but
60:21 - ultimately of course what I need to do
60:23 - is right here I'm going to write an
60:24 - algorithm that generates text based on
60:28 - uh the input so we have a question I
60:31 - mean I have a question you might have a
60:33 - question where how do we start right
60:35 - this is the text the theorin is theirs
60:38 - okay yes it is um how do is my grammar
60:43 - okay there I don't know I'm getting
60:45 - worried but um what do we start with um
60:49 - now this is a question that I will think
60:53 - about and talk about and maybe EV and
60:55 - think in later either in later in this
60:57 - video or in the next video because
60:59 - there's lots of different kinds of ways
61:02 - you might use a marov chain are you
61:03 - using a marov chain to generate short
61:05 - phrases or long bodies of text or how
61:07 - are you reading in the text are you
61:08 - reading in bunch of short phrases are
61:10 - you on the Character level the word
61:11 - level but for right now the simplest
61:13 - thing I'm going to do is start just with
61:16 - the whatever the first three letters
61:19 - whatever the first engram is of this
61:21 - text so I'm going to go down here and
61:24 - say
61:25 - VAR current gr equals text substring 0
61:31 - comma order right I want it from 0 to
61:34 - three that's what I want to start with
61:36 - now what I want to look is say what are
61:39 - the possibilities the possibilities are
61:43 - n gs current
61:46 - gr right I want to look up what are the
61:50 - possible next characters with based on
61:53 - what the current gram is and that's what
61:54 - I've just built this whole object to
61:56 - have it has an array so now I can say
61:58 - next equals I want to pick a random
62:01 - element from that array and guess what
62:03 - P5 since I'm using the P5 Library it has
62:06 - a function called random if I pass it an
62:09 - array it gives me a random element from
62:12 - that array so it's going to pick that
62:14 - random function if it's this array it's
62:16 - going to pick space r i or R randomly
62:18 - one of those okay so once I have that I
62:22 - can say the result is
62:25 - um I can say the result is the current
62:27 - Gram Plus
62:29 - next and I can create P result so let's
62:33 - just look at this and do some generation
62:36 - there there there there there the the
62:39 - space there there come and I he thi so
62:42 - you can see I got R around 50% of the
62:45 - time I got space 25% of the time and I
62:47 - 25% of time not exactly of course
62:49 - because this is probability based and I
62:51 - could run this again we could see the
62:53 - you know R is going to come up more
62:55 - often but I'm getting all these
62:56 - possibilities and I'm standing in front
62:58 - of this so I'm going to uh move this
63:00 - over a little bit okay
63:03 - so now I only did it once though the
63:05 - point is once I've done this now I want
63:07 - to look at the gram heer and see what
63:09 - are the possibilities next and generate
63:11 - a new character then I want to look at
63:12 - er and whatever I picked there and then
63:14 - what are the possibilities after that so
63:16 - I want to do this I want to iterate and
63:17 - continue to do this over and over again
63:19 - so when do I stop doing this that's
63:21 - another question that has no a bunch of
63:24 - different possible answers but I'm gonna
63:26 - say right now basically what I want to
63:29 - do is let's just say I'm gonna do this
63:31 - 10 times I'm going to write a little
63:33 - Loop to do this 10
63:35 - times and what I'm going to do a result
63:38 - needs to be uh kind of a a variable
63:41 - that's declared right the things that I
63:43 - need to do before the loop are pick the
63:45 - starting PHA starting gram and gram and
63:48 - start that result which is that starting
63:50 - end gram then uh I will only have to add
63:53 - the next character
63:54 - so what I'm doing is saying 10 times
63:57 - give me the
63:59 - possibilities then pick a random one and
64:02 - then added to the result but then I need
64:04 - to go and look at the next current gram
64:06 - and what is the next trigram it's the
64:09 - last three characters of whatever I've
64:10 - generated so far so I can say current
64:13 - gram equals text. substring text. length
64:18 - minus 3 text. length oh not text the
64:23 - current result right what I've generated
64:25 - so
64:26 - far right yes excuse me sorry uh text is
64:31 - the original string which is plays no
64:33 - role anymore the original string was
64:35 - simply used to build the table of
64:38 - engrams and their possible next States
64:41 - so now and I could
64:43 - um just to make this a little bit
64:45 - shorter just so you can kind of see it a
64:47 - little more
64:48 - easily uh I'm just going to write it
64:50 - like this so what I'm getting right is
64:53 - that I want the next gram to be the last
64:55 - three characters of the text so now if
64:58 - we do this whoops I have an error in
65:02 - line 30 plus result
65:06 - uh uh result plus equals
65:09 - next there I don't know what was going
65:11 - on there the thein the thein there's
65:13 - okay there thein is I so we can see here
65:16 - instantly how I've got these sequences
65:18 - of 10 characters that have the quality
65:21 - of the source text but they're randomly
65:26 - new
65:28 - uh this is going to be like an edit
65:30 - point because I'm trying to think of
65:31 - what to do
65:34 - next um so I
65:40 - think
65:43 - um okay um I'm trying to think here what
65:46 - time is it by the way 2:22 I'm doing
65:48 - well on time okay so what I want to do
65:51 - next
65:52 - is make maybe bring in some different
65:55 - text into
65:57 - this um so let me actually get that
65:59 - prepared um let's go to unicorn
66:05 - Wikipedia um and I'm just going to
66:08 - like grab some
66:12 - text uh just have it like
66:18 - prepared so MAA this part doesn't need
66:21 - to be in the
66:23 - video
66:26 - and um I can copy paste this
66:32 - in um okay so what I'm going to do is
66:35 - grab that text and then what I'll do
66:38 - also is look I will uh I'm also going to
66:41 - go and do the name generation
66:44 - thing
66:46 - um wa it's 80 degrees it's I finally got
66:49 - to the point where it was always cool in
66:51 - here and now it's like super hot again
66:53 - uh um just do
66:56 - this okay
66:59 - um yasu to
67:02 - Greece T Kane did I say that
67:08 - right uh okay oops I'm on Twitter for no
67:11 - reason uh I
67:15 - lost here we go uh okay so um I'm gonna
67:21 - make an edit point
67:25 - um I'm going to make an edit point to
67:27 - come in and paste new uh text in sorry
67:30 - I'm reading the chat you guys are
67:31 - talking to each other not me
67:35 - okay let's grab some different text and
67:38 - see what happens so I've got already
67:40 - here pre- pre-made like text about
67:42 - unicorns from uh Wikipedia because I
67:45 - don't have any other ideas and I'm going
67:47 - to uh comment this out and just say VAR
67:51 - txt equals and paste this text text in
67:55 - and keep the order at three let's allow
67:58 - the engra let's allow it to generate 50
68:01 - characters in length and let's refresh
68:04 - and hit generate uh we can see uh what
68:08 - do we get the erroneously Beast with the
68:10 - Unicorn is of nature the Y of narwhal
68:13 - with a symbol of the Unicorn W uh and
68:15 - you can see it just sort of cuts off I
68:17 - can I can um let me actually Let It Go
68:20 - for longer if it can as well as let's
68:23 - make the order
68:28 - six oh okay so we got an
68:31 - error so this this is not so this is
68:34 - quite likely to happen so first of all
68:36 - what there's all these crazy numbers in
68:37 - there so I can tell you what the error
68:39 - is which is that if it can never if if
68:44 - this possibility is this is somehow
68:47 - undefined then this random function
68:50 - won't know how to pick something from an
68:51 - array because there's no array and the
68:52 - random function actually is meant to
68:54 - give you a random number so that's why I
68:55 - slly got a random number in there so one
68:58 - thing I can do to just add a little
68:59 - protection here is say if
69:02 - um if not possibilities meaning if it's
69:05 - not defined uh then break and so this is
69:09 - a way of having
69:13 - the this can be edited out
69:17 - also this is a way of having the marov
69:20 - chain end if it has no more
69:22 - possibilities so let's do this and uh I
69:25 - think the issue that I've got here is oh
69:28 - you know what I did actually I hardcoded
69:30 - in the number
69:32 - three so I this should really be order
69:35 - right because I'm changed the order
69:38 - meaning the the length of the NR so I
69:40 - can't just have you know use the number
69:43 - three anymore down there that's a big
69:45 - problem okay so now let me run this
69:47 - generate oops um hold on did I save
69:52 - this and
69:57 - uh hold
69:59 - on this might need to get edited out as
70:02 - well oh it's still doing
70:04 - three so where else do I have hardcoded
70:06 - three oh I have hardcoded three
70:10 - here thises make this easier for edit
70:12 - mat mat to edit oops I also put the
70:15 - hardcoded number three in up here oh
70:18 - this is awful you guys in the chat are
70:19 - already telling me this so now I can hit
70:22 - refresh
70:24 - it's not over
70:26 - yet where else oh look I have it over
70:31 - here I think this is going to work now y
70:35 - there we go so you can see here I'm
70:37 - getting with a with an order of six I'm
70:40 - going to get much I'm going to get less
70:42 - nonsense right because it needs to have
70:45 - sequences of six characters that
70:47 - actually appear in the original Source
70:48 - text and so but if I were to give it
70:50 - something like an order of
70:52 - two we can see we're going to get a lot
70:55 - more nonsense like the in its grow the
70:58 - SYM
71:04 - wi okay so this is my favorite word
71:07 - right
71:09 - here anybody that's I got it that's the
71:12 - name for this
71:15 - channel
71:16 - coding rainbow okay
71:20 - so um so you can see that there's a lot
71:22 - to play with here so on the one hand
71:25 - this video is
71:26 - over and in fact it is over I'm going to
71:29 - in the next video look at a few
71:31 - different scenarios of using a Markov
71:34 - chain um to generate long text versus
71:37 - short text and in the next video what
71:40 - I'm going to do is um try to use a
71:42 - Markov chain to generate
71:46 - um uh a new name for this YouTube
71:48 - channel so hopefully I'm going to
71:50 - publish the code with this obviously um
71:52 - it'll be linked in the video
71:54 - description and um I look forward to
71:56 - seeing what kind of source text you
71:58 - might use that's different than the
72:00 - source text I'm using and um what kind
72:03 - of uh how you might present the outcome
72:06 - is are you kind of appropriating another
72:08 - design to make it appear as if it's
72:09 - generating news headlines or you
72:12 - creating a Twitter bot that generates
72:13 - text using a Markov chain there's a lot
72:15 - of possibilities there and I hope you
72:16 - will share with me your results thanks
72:18 - for
72:20 - watching okay um so so I I chickened out
72:24 - of like just letting this video go and
72:26 - go and go and go and go I'm looking at
72:28 - the time
72:29 - 230 um got another half an hour here so
72:32 - what I want to do I'm trying to decide
72:35 - if I want to pull
72:37 - dynamically from this Google
72:41 - sheet so I don't know why I have a
72:46 - separate um so this is currently a
72:51 - um set of name just making sure there's
72:54 - nothing too awful in
72:56 - here
72:58 - um uh okay so this is currently by the
73:02 - way if you're if you're somebody in the
73:03 - chat can
73:05 - post
73:07 - um U can post a link to this Google form
73:09 - which I posted a while ago um and if
73:12 - people want to keep submitting name
73:13 - ideas uh please do so either way I kind
73:16 - of feel like I want to have a some sort
73:17 - of contest maybe like of course I'm
73:20 - probably just going to name the channel
73:21 - the joy of coding I can't come up with
73:22 - anything else
73:24 - but if there was a different name that I
73:25 - picked and somebody suggested I would
73:26 - love to like give out a prize for that I
73:28 - don't know what the prize would be free
73:30 - programming books some stickers in a
73:32 - t-shirt I don't know um so
73:37 - uh but um let me look here and I think
73:43 - what I should do is just load this from
73:44 - a
73:47 - file
73:49 - um because I think all the code that I'm
73:52 - going to add add to load it from oh why
73:56 - chicken out let's load it from a Google
73:58 - spreadsheet no let's load it from a
74:03 - file uh okay um so what I'm going to do
74:06 - is I'm going to copy this I'm going to
74:08 - create new
74:10 - file and I'm going to call it uh
74:13 - names.txt
74:17 - and I'm going to
74:20 - paste whoa it pasted a lot of EXT ex ra
74:25 - nonsense oh my goodness seriously oh no
74:27 - it's just or is it just that um I have
74:29 - my preference set for to let myself
74:32 - scroll
74:34 - below right hold on hold on everybody
74:37 - I'm going to just paste
74:40 - these there we go okay so now I have a
74:46 - um a list of
74:49 - names so what I'm going to do now is is
74:53 - oh let me I'm sorry let me make a new
74:55 - sketch just
74:59 - to
75:02 - um
75:06 - uh Markov chain Das
75:09 - names um and let me go here back markup
75:14 - chain
75:15 - names and
75:20 - um so and let me close all these and let
75:23 - me go here so what I want now is to load
75:28 - in
75:32 - okay okay I I think I know what I'm
75:34 - going to do and I'm just going to get
75:35 - started let me cycle the
75:46 - cameras oops I left the other one off
75:48 - for no good
75:52 - reason okay
75:55 - how would this code um Alan in the chat
75:57 - asked how would this code behave If
75:58 - instead of letters it would generate
75:59 - every NR another nram um that's
76:03 - interesting I don't actually have an
76:04 - answer for that it's an interesting
76:05 - question and I would be happy to explore
76:07 - that but I would say give that a try and
76:08 - see what happens and let me know okay so
76:12 - what I'm going to do now is uh pull from
76:15 - a list so I'm GNA um let me move this
76:19 - file into
76:22 - here
76:25 - um coding Paradise I kind of like that
76:27 - coding balloon the joy of code joy of
76:29 - coding uh but I miss any really good
76:31 - names people are probably adding some
76:33 - let me just really quickly let check to
76:34 - see if there's any new names I should
76:36 - make sure to add in oh there's a
76:39 - bunch um and I'm gonna come down here
76:44 - and I think maybe I'll take out Barbara
76:46 - and
76:47 - Paul I don't mind high so much I think
76:50 - it's going to cause a problem because
76:51 - it's going to be too short
76:53 - okay um okay so here we go I'm in this
76:57 - next video
77:00 - okay so I think these will be like a
77:03 - coding challenge 0.1 Point 2.3 kind of
77:06 - thing so no I can't think of a better
77:07 - way to do
77:09 - it
77:18 - okay hello in this video I'm going to
77:20 - see if I can come up with a new name for
77:22 - this YouTube Channel cuz I need a new
77:24 - name and what I'm going to do is I'm
77:25 - going to generate one using an algorithm
77:27 - called The marov Chain now if you
77:29 - watched the previous video then I spent
77:30 - a lot of time talking about what a marov
77:32 - chain is and building the code for a
77:34 - marov chain from scratch one thing I
77:36 - didn't do do however which this video
77:38 - will focus on is how to use a marov
77:40 - chain to generate a short phrase so in
77:44 - this sense what I'm going to feed into
77:45 - the marov chain is many many examples of
77:48 - that short phrase so you could use city
77:50 - names or character names or thesis title
77:53 - ideas or course title ideas I'm thinking
77:55 - of like like school stuff because that's
77:57 - what where my brain is at but you know
77:59 - YouTube channel names so um here are a
78:01 - bunch of uh YouTube channel names that
78:03 - came in suggested from the viewers
78:05 - through a Google form now I could
78:07 - actually connect to the Google form
78:08 - directly and I have a example that shows
78:10 - you how to do that but I think for right
78:12 - now for Simplicity sake this is just in
78:14 - a text file called names.txt so I'm
78:16 - going to go to the marov chain code no
78:19 - longer do I want to have the hardcoded
78:21 - text about the Unicorn or the theramin
78:24 - instead what I want to do is I'm going
78:27 - to make a variable called names I'm
78:30 - going to add the preload function so in
78:33 - P5 the preload function is a function
78:35 - where I can preload data files like
78:38 - images sounds and other kinds of data
78:40 - files and I'm going to say names equals
78:43 - load strings names.txt so if I do this
78:47 - and I'm just going to say console log
78:49 - names I'm going to get lots of weird
78:51 - errors because I took out a bunch of
78:52 - other things
78:54 - um I should see oh I don't see any oh
78:56 - yeah that's what I do I'm going to see
78:57 - this array of all the I have an array of
79:00 - all the names that people suggested and
79:02 - there's some other errors so now what I
79:04 - need to do is I need to do this so This
79:08 - NRS remember this NRS variable stores
79:12 - the table of everything so what I need
79:14 - to do is instead of having
79:17 - one piece of text that I feed into the
79:21 - model the NR table
79:23 - um the barov model table thing to call
79:26 - it um I need to do that through a loop
79:28 - so what I need to do is I need to put an
79:30 - outer loop so I'm going to say uh for
79:32 - VAR J equals z J is less than names.
79:36 - length
79:37 - j++ and I'm going to put a loop around
79:40 - all of
79:41 - this and then what I'm going to do is
79:44 - this inner loop is the thing that adds
79:46 - stuff to the NRS model what I'm going to
79:49 - do is say VAR text equals names index I
79:52 - so I'm going to add each line from that
79:55 - text file one at a time to the model the
79:57 - reason why I want to do this is I want
79:59 - all of that to be part of the Poss
80:01 - possibilities however one thing that's
80:05 - not built into my code is well how does
80:08 - a name begin a name could begin with c c
80:11 - o d Jo y c o d t h o d e w n so I want
80:18 - to keep a separate list of actual
80:20 - possible Beginnings for the generation
80:22 - process so on the one hand I'm kind of
80:24 - done here like it um the thing that
80:27 - won't work let me run this uh cannot Le
80:30 - read property length of undefined
80:31 - sketch. JS line 17 let's see what the
80:34 - error is uh ah H oh names index J boy
80:38 - that's bad and j++ so remember the outer
80:41 - loop is J so I'm looking at each there
80:43 - is no
80:44 - I so that worked and you can see I'm
80:47 - getting a nice big list uh with all the
80:50 - sort of possibilities that table is
80:51 - working if I hit gener though I'm going
80:53 - to have an error and that error is txt
80:55 - is not defined because how I was able to
80:59 - how I started the generator was with
81:02 - just the first three letters or whatever
81:04 - the order is of that seed phrase now
81:07 - what I think that would make sense to
81:09 - do is I need to I want to create I'm
81:12 - going to call it
81:14 - Beginnings I don't know if I've
81:15 - mentioned this by the way that this most
81:17 - of the all the code that I'm writing is
81:18 - based on python code written by Allison
81:21 - parish and I'll make sure to credit her
81:23 - in both the previous video and this one
81:25 - I guess I'm mentioning it now I should
81:26 - have mentioned it in the first one um so
81:29 - thank you Allison for that code that at
81:31 - some point I looked at a couple years
81:33 - ago when I first started doing this
81:34 - stuff
81:36 - um okay um so I that was implanted in my
81:40 - head two years ago and it's coming out
81:41 - right now I guess there might be some
81:42 - differences never mind okay so I what I
81:45 - want to do is have an array uh called
81:48 - Beginnings which are what are the
81:49 - possible Beginnings so each time I look
81:51 - at a name
81:53 - the first gram is a possible beginning
81:57 - so
82:00 - if if I equals z beginnings. push gr so
82:06 - I want to keep track of an extra list of
82:08 - all the possible Beginnings meaning here
82:12 - is the table of all of the engrs and
82:15 - possible outcomes and if I look at
82:17 - Beginnings here is an array of all of
82:19 - the possible ways that a name could
82:22 - begin
82:23 - and again there's redundancy here and
82:25 - why are they all two characters instead
82:27 - of
82:28 - three oh my n must be two the N is two
82:32 - okay that's right um I was going to
82:34 - start with
82:35 - three so if I do this again and hit
82:38 - Beginnings we could see yeah so these
82:40 - are all the possible ways that a name
82:41 - could begin and there's redundancy in
82:43 - there but I like that because I want my
82:45 - names to begin with the same
82:47 - probabilities as my input data so now
82:50 - what I'm going to do is down here here
82:53 - the current gram just needs I just need
82:55 - to pick a random beginning So Random
82:58 - Beginnings so I just pick a random
83:00 - beginning and that's where I start and
83:02 - then I let the algorithm just go so
83:04 - let's run it and see what I get coding
83:07 - codes and unicolors coding time rainbows
83:09 - shiftman's rainbow coding heres and dis
83:11 - spectrum of colored orange yellow code
83:14 - Kiton that in that so you can see have
83:18 - we found something yet I think first of
83:20 - all a couple things one is I should
83:21 - probably limit the name to about maybe
83:23 - 15 characters I don't know maybe let's
83:25 - limit it to
83:26 - 20 and uh maybe let's make the order two
83:29 - because it's making too much sense
83:32 - coding blander cande unic coding happy
83:35 - recod ey coding pitchy code Cod the K
83:39 - Dr
83:41 - coding OD rating C so you can see here
83:46 - that this is working but what the order
83:48 - is is really going to affect um affect
83:52 - the sort of the this. show coding
83:54 - balloon coding meteor meteorological P
83:58 - Happy Jumpy Dancy codes and so uh that
84:01 - order might be too high I might only be
84:02 - getting literal the sort of literal
84:04 - names and another thing here to point
84:06 - out is this would be much more probably
84:08 - interesting if I had a data set of a
84:10 - 100,000 names that I could use um you
84:13 - know something you might try is to you
84:15 - know what's your input data come up with
84:18 - what the thing you're trying to name see
84:19 - if you can find a really big data set
84:21 - maybe have a slide
84:23 - where you can adjust the order so the
84:25 - the user can actually pick what that
84:27 - order is as as the user is generating
84:30 - text from it so I don't know if we've
84:32 - come I really thought that at the end of
84:35 - this video I'd be able to do this and
84:37 - now the new name of this channel is you
84:40 - know let's just say it's okay hold on
84:42 - let's make the order three that's kind
84:44 - of in between let's just say it's for
84:46 - the rest of today the name of this
84:48 - channel
84:49 - is drum roll
84:55 - Joy of light appearing D # jooy of light
84:59 - appearing D see you all in another video
85:02 - I I have some more stuff that I need to
85:04 - talk about which is looking at uh
85:07 - generating Markov chains for longer
85:08 - pieces of text perhaps as well as uh on
85:11 - the word level I think would be worth
85:13 - taking a look at as well
85:16 - okay um all right people in the chat are
85:18 - telling me to update the
85:20 - list um all right we're going to have to
85:22 - take out some not
85:25 - familyfriendly
85:27 - uh
85:30 - uh
85:32 - suggestions oh I think I got most of
85:34 - these
85:35 - already um I'm a little worried about
85:37 - what that might generate nervous coding
85:39 - works for me uh I can add a few more
85:42 - names
85:44 - in uh and let's see what we
85:48 - get
85:50 - uh space space of code
85:53 - kitchen did somebody space
85:56 - of that just came out of nowhere that's
85:59 - the magic of doing this uh what did I
86:01 - want to do here I wanted to change the
86:03 - order again to uh
86:09 - two
86:11 - uh hammerin harrin bowerland arcs life
86:16 - dan.
86:17 - plasted okay so you get the idea I play
86:20 - with this on my own later the D is
86:22 - always appearing um okay so uh Joy of
86:27 - coding it is once
86:30 - again
86:34 - uh okay so how I think that I
86:38 - am closing in on let's let me think so I
86:42 - I think I should uh look at doing this
86:45 - on the word level H let me look at my
86:49 - existing
86:51 - examples
86:53 - so give me a second
86:55 - here as always I always
86:59 - forg here I have an idea I'm gonna play
87:01 - this
87:04 - song just for a little
87:07 - [Music]
87:16 - [Music]
87:19 - bit Joy of cod
87:24 - Joy of
87:27 - [Laughter]
87:31 - coding right see that's that's a new
87:34 - version of the song it
87:35 - [Laughter]
87:39 - works uh okay
87:43 - uh um okay so now what I'm looking for
87:48 - is uh I want to just look at my existing
87:51 - example
87:54 - um
87:56 - oops on a different
88:00 - port uh
88:03 - marov okay so I think that I have
88:06 - successfully kind of talked through this
88:09 - example
88:11 - um I love how much you guys love the
88:13 - this dot
88:15 - song I need some more who out there
88:18 - wants to make some music and remixes of
88:20 - things I'll do anything
88:23 - um okay
88:25 - [Music]
88:27 - um what am I looking for here
88:32 - um um okay so ah yeah so this is all
88:35 - these are all good things to look at the
88:38 - by word thing do I have maybe I should
88:41 - at least do a part three which does this
88:44 - by word let me look at my code and see
88:47 - what the difference is I think this is
88:48 - going to be pretty easy to
88:50 - do um
88:55 - um uh oops no I want to keep that
88:59 - running
89:03 - um okay
89:05 - marov by
89:07 - word so this is code that I've
89:10 - written before and what I do
89:15 - is just do it with an array of tokens I
89:19 - don't feel like doing this now I think
89:21 - I'll come back to doing the
89:25 - um uh I I think I will come back to
89:33 - um
89:35 - um I think I will come back to this
89:37 - stuff later I'm going to do a wrap-up
89:38 - video and show some other
89:40 - examples um so let me do a wrapup week
89:44 - six and um talk about homework
89:50 - ideas um oh I I didn't update I'm have
89:52 - to go to my old
89:57 - site
89:58 - [Music]
90:00 - um uh hold on everyone week seven markup
90:05 - chains so these are some exercise
90:13 - ideas
90:19 - uh oh yes of course
90:22 - I can't believe I didn't think of that
90:24 - okay so um I didn't even mention that in
90:27 - class today okay so I think I'm wrapping
90:29 - up now I'm going to be here for about 10
90:31 - more minutes and um I am going
90:37 - to um kind of do a wrapup video to show
90:41 - a few more
90:44 - examples
90:48 - and
90:50 - um close this and
90:56 - um to do a few more
90:59 - examples and um talk about some homework
91:02 - exercise ideas sorry I've lost my I've
91:05 - lost my train of thought uh okay so this
91:08 - is going to be the last
91:10 - uh video of today uh I will be once
91:13 - again live streaming next Tuesday around
91:15 - the same time in the
91:17 - afternoon um and I know that some of you
91:20 - are asking me to update my list I will
91:22 - run I'm going to run this a lot more
91:23 - later to see if I get anything good and
91:25 - I'll publish the code and you guys can
91:27 - run it as well and maybe what I'll do is
91:28 - actually hook it into the spreadsheet
91:30 - when I publish the code so that people
91:31 - can play around with it to see if they
91:33 - come up with any names or hook in their
91:34 - own spreadsheet um okay so I'm going to
91:37 - do a Wrap Up Video to talk about um
91:39 - exercises that you could think about
91:40 - doing if you happen to be following this
91:43 - as like a course which you may or may
91:45 - not be doing and then uh I will be gone
91:48 - for the day I will say however that I'm
91:50 - actually going to do a little bit more
91:52 - recording uh it just won't be live
91:54 - streamed as some of you know I posted an
91:56 - interview with Claire Kerney vpy and
91:58 - chansy Fleet about accessibility en
92:00 - coding so I'm working on more guest
92:02 - interviews and guest tutorials and I'm
92:04 - hoping to get another one done this
92:06 - afternoon so there will be another video
92:08 - with a surprise guest um that I will be
92:11 - um that I will be uh uh publishing as
92:15 - well soon okay so here we go um thank
92:17 - you guys for tuning in I'll take a few
92:19 - questions after I do this last uh
92:21 - programming from A to Z wrap up of week
92:24 - five um video week seven session SE six
92:28 - whatever it
92:29 - is
92:33 - okay okay so maybe you've watched my
92:36 - videos so far about engrams and marov
92:39 - chains and that sort of thing and you're
92:40 - thinking what what's the next step for
92:42 - you what could you possibly make so on
92:44 - the one hand I think the assignment or
92:47 - the exercise for this week it's really
92:49 - legitimate to not program anything new
92:51 - in in fact a lot of using a marov chain
92:53 - to generate text is about two things
92:56 - outside of the actual algorithm itself
92:58 - number one it's what source text are you
93:00 - picking and why are you picking that
93:01 - Source text and number two is what are
93:04 - you presenting to uh a reader a viewer a
93:08 - user an audience and what medium are you
93:11 - presenting it in are you using a marov j
93:13 - chain to generate dialogue for a
93:15 - performance are you using a marov chain
93:17 - to generate tweets are you recreating
93:20 - you know news artic and the project
93:22 - about designing a news like website that
93:25 - looks like real news but actually it's
93:26 - marov generated news there are a lot of
93:28 - possibilities there using a marov chain
93:31 - to generate text is not really a novel
93:33 - idea at all and you'll see I'll try to
93:35 - link in this video's description to lots
93:37 - of existing projects that use this
93:39 - technique that you can also find for
93:40 - experimentation now here's the thing
93:42 - though I have some additional examples
93:44 - that you know the videos that I made
93:46 - that you if you watch the Markov Chain
93:47 - video previously I'm just implementing
93:49 - the sort of raw algorithm and doing this
93:51 - kind of simple not simple but doing the
93:53 - sort of basic implementation of it so
93:55 - one thing I want to do and that's this
93:57 - example that's trying to generate coder
93:59 - full Coden bows that's kind of awesome
94:01 - fifm raying shift so you can see there's
94:04 - some new names that I'm trying to think
94:05 - of for this channel now um I do have
94:09 - some pre-made examples that if you go to
94:11 - the link to the a toz uh GitHub
94:15 - repository you'll see I want to
94:16 - highlight some of these number one and
94:19 - these are uh by the way this is a markup
94:21 - chain example that does something much
94:23 - like my YouTube channel naming and it
94:24 - just takes naming of names of lots of
94:27 - media art programs and uh creates uh
94:30 - names so let's if we get anything good
94:32 - sentle program and arts and media arts
94:33 - and Code Media Arts prograded
94:35 - Technologies program uh creations and
94:38 - Entrepreneurship anti- disiplina
94:40 - Technology Program scent technology
94:42 - people um so you can see computer action
94:44 - that's pretty great so you can see this
94:46 - is the kind of thing for naming you can
94:48 - also look at my second example and try
94:51 - to find the differences right between
94:52 - generating short text this reads Mary
94:55 - Shell's Frankenstein from Project
94:56 - Gutenberg and generates kind of an
94:59 - actual very very long text with
95:01 - paragraphs and everything written in the
95:03 - quote unquote style which isn't exactly
95:05 - accurate but uses a mark of change to
95:06 - generate a new text so you might look at
95:08 - those and look at the difference between
95:10 - short text and long text both of those
95:12 - examples are generating text on the
95:15 - character by character basis so when I
95:17 - say a trigram I mean a collection of a
95:19 - sequence a contiguous sequence of three
95:21 - characters and three characters but you
95:23 - can also do this by word so you can
95:25 - consider the tokens not as individual
95:28 - characters but as words a rainbow is
95:31 - Rainbow is a is a meteorological so this
95:35 - is an example that instead of using
95:37 - sequences of characters using sequences
95:38 - of words and you can see the result here
95:40 - in a primary rainbow with inverse order
95:42 - of its colors reversed so um at some
95:45 - point I could go back and do another
95:46 - coding challenge to implement it by word
95:48 - if people are interested in that but
95:50 - right now I might just refer you to this
95:51 - code example another thing you might
95:53 - think about is what are other tokens or
95:56 - things that happen in sequence in text
95:59 - for example this text is not just this
96:01 - sequence of characters or this sequence
96:03 - of words it's actually a sequence of
96:05 - parts of
96:06 - speech verb noun noun verb determinant
96:10 - adjective adverb I'm getting that in the
96:12 - wrong order but what this actually does
96:14 - is evaluate the contiguous sequence of
96:17 - parts of speech use a Markov Jane to
96:20 - change a g generate a sequence of parts
96:22 - of speech and then pick words that are
96:24 - parts of that parts of speech to
96:26 - generate the text and the result here
96:27 - you can see is the Observer it reaches
96:29 - the meteorological set the raay section
96:31 - in a section and 40 to 42 degrees
96:34 - percent or more in the system between an
96:36 - arc and 50% etc etc so you can take a
96:38 - look at that example as well another
96:41 - thing you might think about is mixing
96:43 - two texts within a marov chain right
96:46 - what if I generate this uses if I take
96:48 - the slider all the way over here this is
96:51 - generating text using a markof chain
96:53 - only from Midsummer Night Dream this is
96:55 - now generating text only from my nature
96:58 - of code book and now if I kind of put it
97:02 - like over here let's see if we can
97:03 - generate something good uh that's a
97:06 - little bit too Shakespearean um let's
97:08 - let's let's give it a little more nature
97:10 - of code uh do it again unto his point
97:13 - numbers rather voice versions when
97:16 - program how do I knowledge about that we
97:17 - add one we can be the mouse location
97:19 - strong prevailment of the true for both
97:21 - x's and dispose of z0 We Still of this
97:24 - kind wanting but how to my Conde of
97:27 - length one then have our motion the
97:30 - close to your youth to
97:33 - one okay anyway I got a little too
97:35 - caught up in like pretending I'm like
97:36 - acting Shakespeare with my marov chain
97:38 - but anyway so you can see that's you
97:39 - might think about what if you're mixing
97:41 - two texts three texts how do you adjust
97:43 - the probabilities I'll give you a little
97:44 - hint behind the scenes if the
97:46 - probability if I want the probability of
97:48 - the Shakespeare text to be higher I just
97:50 - feed the Shakespeare text text in
97:51 - multiple times again it's not the most
97:53 - efficient way of doing this but it works
97:55 - you could think about other ways that
97:57 - you might do that um um you can get you
98:00 - can use a Google sheet I have a Mad Libs
98:02 - generator that pulls data from a Google
98:03 - sheet you could do the same thing with a
98:04 - Markov chain you could pull from an API
98:07 - I have an example that pulls from Reddit
98:09 - um and then also I should mention of
98:11 - course that even though I'm using my own
98:14 - Markov generating code based on code
98:17 - written in Python by Allison Parish um
98:19 - you could also use the Rita Library
98:22 - which has a Markov generator built into
98:23 - it and I have a previous video that I
98:25 - should link to in this description all
98:27 - about the Rita library and encourage you
98:28 - to look at that and see its
98:30 - implementation um so um these are things
98:33 - that you could think about I made a
98:34 - little list here also that I'll
98:36 - reference um so on the one hand just
98:40 - generate what's your own existing text
98:42 - what's your own what's what's order
98:44 - you're picking how are you presenting it
98:46 - um you could think about just sort of
98:47 - visualizing the frequencies or the the
98:50 - the possible pathway
98:51 - uh this web trigrams by Chris Harrison
98:54 - is a project I reference you can see
98:56 - this visualization of those uh of those
98:59 - engrams is something you might think
99:01 - about um and then I talked about mashing
99:04 - up two text the gretry project is
99:06 - another useful reference that I'll have
99:07 - a link to and then the other thing that
99:10 - I think is really important to mention
99:12 - is even though this course and this set
99:14 - of videos are I'm focusing on this idea
99:17 - of text and the characters or words
99:19 - being States and this continuous
99:21 - sequence of States this Markov chain you
99:24 - the units of the Markov chain don't have
99:26 - to be text what if they are musical
99:28 - notes or rhythms or colors or uh vectors
99:32 - what other types of visual designs or
99:35 - sounds or music could you generate
99:38 - through a marov chain so I hope you will
99:40 - think about making something with this
99:42 - uh you can share it with me at shiffman
99:44 - on Twitter you can share it in the
99:45 - comments here and you can also if you
99:47 - feel so inclined support the channel uh
99:50 - through patreon that's a if you want to
99:51 - make a financial contribution and um
99:53 - then you can also share and get feedback
99:55 - um through a slack channel that is for
99:58 - patreon subscribers okay so come back
100:00 - here hello okay so can you all see me
100:03 - okay
100:05 - um sorry I'm having trouble seeing the
100:08 - chat
100:10 - um okay I am back I you should be
100:13 - hearing me in both channels now that's a
100:16 - a wirecast glitch that I have to change
100:18 - a setting and it will never save that
100:20 - setting no matter what I do um okay so
100:24 - let's see if I can get through now
100:27 - um please help me in the chat what was
100:30 - the last thing I said before I
100:34 - froze
100:36 - um um I I heard maybe I I mentioned the
100:39 - ganry project I did did I not talk about
100:42 - how you could use a Markov chain with
100:44 - musical notes or pixel
100:49 - colors
100:51 - thank you for watching oh I did say that
100:54 - did I get that far okay hold on a second
100:56 - I I don't know why I'm asking because I
100:59 - have a
101:02 - recording I will look at my
101:04 - recording uh let me look at the
101:08 - recording because if I got all the way
101:10 - to thank you to for watching then I'm
101:13 - good code
101:17 - Bas you
101:19 - also
101:21 - it's very hard to get to the end
101:24 - here markup don't have to be text what
101:27 - if they are musical notes or rhythms or
101:30 - colors or vectors what other types of
101:34 - visual designs or sounds or music could
101:37 - you generate through a markup chain so I
101:40 - hope you will think about making
101:41 - something with this uh you can share it
101:43 - with me at shiftman on Twitter you can
101:45 - share it in the comments here and you
101:47 - can also if you feel so inclined support
101:49 - the channel uh through Paton that's a if
101:51 - you want to make a financial
101:52 - contribution and um then you can also
101:54 - share and get feedback um through a
101:57 - slack channel that is sorry I'm watching
101:59 - myself okay so you can't see it though
102:03 - ah okay so like it's just like a weird
102:05 - awkward cut off but I did get uh I did
102:08 - get everything and the camera shut off
102:11 - so um I'm just going to like record uh
102:15 - um me saying the last thing about
102:17 - patreon and slack and if um
102:21 - Matthew will figure out what makes sense
102:23 - how to edit it uh edit it um together
102:28 - uh uh welcome to people of all ages and
102:31 - from all parts of the world it's so
102:33 - exciting and nice to um see you guys
102:35 - okay so
102:37 - um um I am going to uh do that
102:41 - now and then I'll take a few questions
102:45 - and then I have to run but I'm hoping to
102:47 - record more let me actually check my let
102:50 - me just do that that now before I forget
102:51 - okay
102:53 - so
102:58 - um uh what was I saying um I was
103:01 - something about the slack oh and if you
103:03 - feel so inclined you can subscribe to
103:05 - the uh patreon uh Link in this video's
103:08 - description and uh with uh subscribing
103:10 - to the patreon which is a financial
103:12 - contribution I'm like I hate doing the
103:15 - plugging the patreon thing and now I
103:17 - just like feel so awkward doing a
103:19 - special thing just for that so but I'm
103:20 - just going to do it anyway
103:23 - um um I really could just record thank
103:26 - you for watching which I think is all
103:27 - that that end of that video needed um so
103:30 - by the way I hear some I heard when I
103:32 - played it back I heard a little bit of
103:34 - clipping like like it the audio buzzes
103:36 - when I speak kind of loudly I don't know
103:38 - if you guys are noticing that um
103:43 - okay you can also uh subscribe to this
103:46 - Channel's patreon there's a link in the
103:48 - video's description if you would like to
103:49 - make a financial contribution of course
103:51 - that's optional but with that you can
103:53 - get membership to a slack Channel where
103:54 - you can also share your assignments and
103:55 - get feedback from a community of folks
103:57 - in the slack channel so thank you so
103:59 - much for watching I look forward to
104:02 - seeing what you make from this and look
104:03 - forward to seeing you I don't actually
104:05 - see anybody when I'm doing this I'm just
104:06 - staring at a camera but it feels like I
104:08 - am so I look forward to seeing you in
104:10 - the next video okay bye
104:12 - bye uh okay great so I think I'm done
104:15 - for
104:16 - today uh um I'll answer a few questions
104:19 - in the chat Emily mcau asked do you know
104:22 - any c languages not languages written in
104:25 - C tongue Emoji um I don't know what if I
104:31 - don't know what to how exactly to answer
104:32 - to this but I do have some experience
104:34 - programming in C++ and in just plain
104:36 - vanilla oldfashioned C programming um
104:40 - and I used to do a lot of that I would
104:41 - say prior to 2005 when um things like
104:46 - processing weren't around frankly um um
104:49 - and I One Thing I would say for and I
104:51 - mentioned this before but for those of
104:52 - you who are interested in C++ and kind
104:55 - of creative applications using C++ I
104:57 - would take a look at open Frameworks as
104:59 - well as Cinder which are two creative
105:01 - coding
105:02 - Frameworks
105:04 - um uh there's a question that says I
105:07 - heard marov chains are used in neural
105:09 - networks how does it
105:16 - work backing away slowly as the S
105:19 - question with the neural network comes
105:20 - up oh boy I'm really planning to make
105:22 - some videos about neural networks it's
105:24 - going to happen uh soon uh uh hopefully
105:27 - before the end of the year and more in
105:28 - the spring um one thing I'll say is that
105:31 - there are a lot of uh sort of text
105:33 - generation experiments and things
105:35 - happening these days there was a movie
105:37 - script that was written through text
105:39 - generation and so I think um in the same
105:41 - way that you can train the marov chain
105:44 - to analyze an existing body of text and
105:47 - look at the sequence and probabilities
105:48 - to generate new text there are ways to
105:51 - do the same with a neural network in
105:53 - that you can feed a neural network text
105:55 - the neural network can try to create
105:57 - some type of model of the qualities of
106:00 - that text and generate new text out of
106:02 - that model so this is something that I
106:03 - do hope to explore in a future video I
106:05 - that for like I'm like a politician not
106:07 - answering the question what are all the
106:09 - programming languages you
106:11 - know C C++ Java
106:17 - JavaScript that's it I think uh can you
106:20 - do a coding challenge for an incremental
106:22 - clicker I don't even know what that is
106:25 - uh but I would be glad to it to do so um
106:29 - uh people are asking in the chat just to
106:30 - remind you if you want email
106:32 - notifications for when I do a live
106:33 - stream coding.com please uh if you feel
106:37 - so inclined subscribe to the channel and
106:39 - watch the videos that's actually one of
106:40 - the things that you can do if people
106:42 - have also asked if they could contribute
106:43 - and I'm always looking for people to
106:45 - subtitle or translate the videos uh to
106:47 - help make them more accessible um which
106:49 - um so if you're interested in helping
106:50 - with that please reach out to me it's
106:52 - pretty easy to do you can do it directly
106:53 - on YouTube um oh I know PHP yeah I know
106:56 - PHP no I don't really do R Ruby python
106:59 - or Lua but I'm interested in all those
107:02 - languages uh Python's awesome right uh
107:06 - can you still buy stickers yeah those
107:07 - stickers those stickers are still for
107:10 - sale uh I still have a lot of them I
107:13 - don't know if at some point I'm GNA have
107:14 - to take that down but get them now if
107:15 - you want the
107:17 - stickers uh chatbot could be a subject
107:20 - related to this yes something I'm really
107:21 - interested in doing by the way I just
107:22 - got one of those Amazon Echo things and
107:24 - I'm interested in doing some kind of
107:26 - text to speech uh I wanted to do a video
107:28 - about how to make a skill for the Amazon
107:30 - Alexa and I was going to make a Harry
107:31 - Potter Sorting Hat based on a twitterbot
107:34 - that Darius kazmi made called the
107:36 - Sorting bot uh super collider I a little
107:39 - bit of Arduino experience I hope to have
107:41 - some guests do some physical Computing
107:43 - videos on this channel at some point I'm
107:44 - looking for I'm kind of trying to I'm
107:47 - having guests do topics that I'm not as
107:48 - experienced with like 3D and Arduino and
107:51 - that type of thing I guess I know HTML
107:53 - CSS if those are programming languages
107:55 - we could have a discussion how long have
107:57 - I been learning to program well I like
107:59 - the way you asked that question because
108:01 - I'm still learning to program always be
108:02 - learning to program there's no you know
108:04 - JavaScript by the way i' never
108:05 - programmed in until like a year and a
108:07 - half ago or two years ago I can't
108:08 - remember now at this point but I really
108:10 - didn't program seriously until uh two I
108:13 - don't know if seriously it's the right
108:14 - word but I didn't really program till
108:16 - 2001 I had done a few classes in middle
108:19 - school and in high school and in college
108:21 - but I had never really taken to it or
108:23 - made anything with it until I started as
108:25 - a student at ITP that program where I
108:26 - teach
108:27 - now um a tutorial on how to make a gooey
108:31 - interface in
108:33 - CP uh a video about Hamming distance boy
108:36 - all these suggestions of things that how
108:37 - do I see JavaScript in 10
108:40 - years uh it won't exist anymore I don't
108:43 - know I I don't know I don't like to
108:44 - predict the future I like to just enjoy
108:46 - the stuff that I'm learn that's
108:48 - happening now and that I can uh kind
108:50 - kind of play with is there a webbased P5
108:52 - IDE there is one in development it's
108:54 - very far along we are Alpha Testing it
108:56 - at ITP unfortunately we're just not
108:58 - ready to have sort of like a large
109:00 - number of people using it but um I would
109:02 - expect it to come in early 2017 our goal
109:04 - is to have it out for the spring
109:07 - semester uh yes I want to do steering
109:09 - stuff with neural networks and uh
109:11 - reinforcement learning is something that
109:13 - I'm really hoping to be able to tackle I
109:14 - don't know how to do it so I have to
109:16 - figure it out I've been reading and
109:17 - researching browser automation I'm I am
109:20 - going to do Chrome extensions at some
109:22 - point this fall um okay so you guys are
109:24 - giving me a lot of great suggestions I
109:26 - am going to play my Goodbye
109:29 - music um when this song ends I will cut
109:32 - off the
109:34 - stream and do some
109:38 - like always with the rainbows if you
109:40 - have suggestions for a um channel name
109:44 - I'm all ears right now thinking about
109:47 - Joy of coding I need some new design
109:49 - stuff uh Scott wooden who did all the
109:51 - logo uh and website design um hopefully
109:55 - he'll he might be available to continue
109:56 - to do that work but if anybody wants to
109:57 - contribute or has ideas I'm welcome I'm
110:01 - uh I am uh would love to
110:04 - hear
110:07 - um hello
110:09 - Ireland
110:11 - hello coding pism yes I like coding
110:15 - rainbow as
110:16 - well coding prism maybe is what you
110:19 - meant um welcome new listeners viewers
110:24 - um I will be back next Tuesday afternoon
110:27 - um some around the same time probably in
110:29 - the 1:30 to 4:00 Eastern Tander time
110:32 - hour um Harry Potter invisibility with
110:34 - that shirt that's a great
110:36 - idea um and we'll see what we'll
110:40 - do um and um that's that rainbows and
110:46 - unicorns may you find them in your life
110:48 - in your week
110:51 - hope you spend some time outside with
110:53 - friends with people not programming or
110:56 - programming with people I was outside
110:59 - walking in the park in New York City the
111:01 - leaves were changing it was beautiful
111:02 - there were ducks and I have to say as
111:04 - much as I enjoyed riding a marov chain I
111:07 - I enjoyed the Ducks and the leaves
111:08 - almost just as
111:10 - much uh hello to
111:13 - Berlin uh I um um I Am a Unicorn this
111:19 - this today's stream wasn't about Markov
111:20 - chains if you missed it um the archive
111:22 - of this live stream will make its way
111:24 - onto YouTube at some point soon as well
111:26 - as edited versions of the videos today
111:29 - fun fun function is a great uh other
111:31 - YouTube channel and here we go I've got
111:34 - about uh I don't know how much longer
111:37 - this song has a minute
111:39 - left
111:41 - uh hello New Zealand I've never been to
111:44 - New Zealand and I would love to go there
111:45 - coding

112:02 - countries Brazil
112:04 - India um and I will see you guys next
112:06 - week what else context free grammars
112:09 - make some stuff um share it with me I I
112:12 - really somebody remind me on Monday to
112:16 - gather on the slack Channel or over
112:17 - Twitter things that people have made
112:19 - Twitter word counting and marov chain
112:22 - stuff so I can show a few viewer created
112:25 - projects um on the live stream next week
112:27 - okay uh hello Belfast hello us and
112:30 - Mexico City and the Netherlands and I'm
112:32 - signing out from sfpc in the West
112:34 - Village and I'll see you all
112:37 - soon
112:42 - [Music]
112:47 - crap

Cleaned transcript:

hello welcome I am live once again uh Dan schiffman here live from the school for poetic computation in the West Village of New York City uh hopefully you can see me and hear me I've got some music playing in the background little opening music I don't have the opening trailer promo video Whatever thing which I will discuss a bit about in a moment uh I want to make sure things seem to be working so let me know in the chat and um it's about uh 115 p.m. on a eastern time on a Tuesday in New York City a beautiful sunny day but I'm here in a cave with some hot lights and some cameras pointed at me and a green wall behind me to talk to you about programming and coding and rainbows and unicorns and joyfulness and all sorts of things like that um so let's see what so what's happening today um who Am I who are you where are we why are we here all that sort of stuff so I said before my name is Dan I do a weekly live stream um around creative coding topics um I like to think that this is uh programming to make useless playful experiments um and I hope you enjoy some get something out of it I hope you learn something and I hope you contribute to a community and open source of people also being creative with code and I hope you will consider being inclusive and bringing in people from everywhere into this world of creativity and coding so um if you want to sign up for Stuff um you can subscribe to this channel I don't know where you're watching this there's probably a button somewhere maybe like down here I think there's a button over there where you can subscribe to this channel um you can stay tuned to my Twitter feed shiffman and if you go to coding rainbow.com uh the URL will likely change soon which I will also uh talk about but if uh currently if you go to coding rainbow.com there you can uh sign up for an email list where I send out announcements uh when I'm going to do live streams as well as uh if you feel so inclined you can support my channel on patreon and be subscribed to a slack Channel okay so um let's see what I think that's most of my introductory nonsense stuff that I'm trying to think if I forgot anything so let me talk a couple things first about the time and topic of today so the topic for today is oh no no I I need like applause I don't have Applause I really got work on my sound effects that's the only like sound effect I have so it just goes with everything uh I also have this power um the uh topic for today is marov chains uh is that it is are marov chains is a marov chain this is the topic Markov chains but there's a lot that goes into that there's some stuff about objectoriented programming in JavaScript there's some stuff about looking at text in terms of something called an NR there's something about probability and using arrays and the random function function But ultimately by the end of today I will have built I will I would like to by the end of today have built from scratch a Markov chain generator to generate text based on existing Source texts so I'm going to go through all the pieces of that and talk to you about what a marov chain is and how you can program one and make some experiments now the timing is fortuitous because I I happen to need a new name for this channel now previously I called this channel a coding rainbow it's a name that I adore and love for a number of reasons um number one it's sort of like a happy name I love rainbows uh it's an homage to uh Reading Rainbow which is a children's 80s children's television show and I think it's currently an app about reading and literacy when they're do wonderful wonderful work um it sounds inclusive meaning it's something for everybody and it doesn't sound too serious and it doesn't sound too Technical and so I'm looking uh to at least at the very least keep the rainbow Taste the rainbow whoops that's that's like a skittles reference or something I think um and um but I do need a new name unfortunately due to a trademark uh issue but you know I'm still can't stop me in my Rainbows are people still am I still in this live stream I don't see anything going on in the chat I think I still am there okay so I do need a new name and I've been taking suggestions so if you first of all if you have a suggestion this is like the worst URL ever if somebody could post this if you guys are listening to me please just post something in the chat because I don't see any messages ah okay no no we're here we sing okay um so um you can go to this form and you can submit a name suggestion and since the topic is unfortunately I need somebody figure out get me some rainbow uh sweaters or headbands or tshirts or something that doesn't have green in it because I got this green screen wall so it doesn't work um but I want it's it's fortuitous timing because the algorithm that I want to look up today is something to generate text and what better example to use to generate text than to generate a new name for this uh YouTube channel um by the way just um as a matter of reference I've posted a couple tweets and I've gotten a lot of feedback right now it seems what's leading is the joy of coding now you might think like Oh no you're GNA have the same problem because there is The Joy of Painting a very a famous uh PB also PBS uh show about painting starring Bob Ross who is a wellknown wonderful person who made a wonderful show uh and I like to think of him as an inspiration and a model for this thing that I'm doing on YouTube um there is also however the joy of cooking which I kind of think of this more alike like I'm cooking you got to get the ingredients and put everything together and then Bing comes out of the oven and here's the little like marov chain text generator so but but from what I understand speaking with getting some legal advice is that the joy of phrase is too generic to be trademarked and as long as I don't appropriate any symbols or logo um or otherwise things too similar to an existing something that I would likely be okay now the issue with the joy of coding is that there there's a Wonder there's a conference um out of Europe called Joy of coding there are a couple other like online platforms or YouTube streams that have that terminology in them so I don't know oh there's a problem with the mic okay and I was just talking and talking uh fix the mic okay I don't know what to do here let's try turning it off line first to wake her up sure okay all right Mercy just say the line on the action CU right then wake up here we go rolling please here we go settle and oh sorry I did the static thing again crap is it better there's someone else on the mic Channel that's hilarious I just want to know if it's fixed now it is better yeah okay sorry about that awful sound thing um okay so I'm back what where did I last leave off everybody what was the last thing I said was I talking about the joy of coding okay I I cannot tell what's going on uh in the chat you guys the problem is when you just say yes or no you're 10 or 15 seconds behind me and I don't know what you're referring to so if you're answering a question of mine unfortunately you have to say yes it sounds fine or uh yes you were talking about the joy of coding okay yes Joy of coding okay thank you um okay so that's uh leading a uh um possibility for the name of this channel um and we'll see I lost my train of thought I was talking about Bob Ross and how I I can't etc etc uh so when I turned off the mic you heard somebody else okay I got it okay so anyway so the um so I have to figure out what I'm going to do about this you know right now I think this channel is just called Daniel chefman programming or something like that um but uh and I got some I don't need to worry about the point of what I'm doing is making these videos and uh hopefully creating a community of people who are watching these videos and interacting with each other about this sort of stuff I used to have this other light here there we go um and um so I don't know I just turned on another light I don't know if it's better or worse um so um yes so some of you in the chat are asking me more questions about the trademark issues I am very happy to answer those questions static again I'm seeing some of you post static in the chat but I'm a little worried some of you are watching from earlier so um let me know um um but I will be happy to answer those Mike is still Mike is not having is having issues okay um I I I this is too bad this this is a little bit this is quite a bit of fail here what I'm going to do is I am going to change I don't know how to change the mic Channel anybody know how do we really think that's the issue um uh yeah um let me see what I can do here uh one thing is I can do this is that a little better um coding Rambo is a great suggestion um I can try to I'm G to mute myself oh bumping into something maybe it's just actually alt f4 to change the mic Channel can't hear anything it's fine maybe this the way the mic is on this particular this is a different tshirt than they usually wear um and it is kind of scratching against oh hold on a second is it better if I hold it out without it being attached to my shirt it's fine when I pick it up so I wonder if there's an issue with the way that it is um yeah it's intermittent let's see where it's attached to my shirt let's see hold on I have an idea have an idea this is riveting hold on let me put all some music for you guys as always I always forget the this do this do this do do this do do do I'm going to do you guys are giv me great suggestions s is okay I did turn it down I this this St I did turn it down now I turned it back up um okay so how are things now this this was going so well I had a whole plan um I'm over here looking to see if I can figure out how to change the channel all right everyone's saying it's fine I'm gonna I'm gonna just keep going and hopefully there won't be an issue okay so um let uh oh yeah so does this cause a problem is there static now because I do a lot of this wall sits you know wall sits are a good exercise how long do you think I could do that for it messed up again okay just continue still issue ah okay I'm gonna um I'm GNA keep going for a little bit and I'm going to check in about the mic and see if I can reset things it's static when I move oh static more static over here okay getting a lot of mixed signals from the chat but I have to keep going um okay so um as you guys may be aware I am teaching a course at ITP called programming from a toz um I have been using this fall these weekly sessions which will be on Tuesdays going forward for the time being to cover a lot of topics here and you can see um these are the topics I've covered so far and what I want to add to this list today is Markov chains so um in essence um yeah I slapped my shirt and the noise came it's a fair cage okay have a I do sort of have a backup plan but I guess I'm not g to um okay so what I want to do by the way is I want to First do an introduction to week five uh video so one thing that happens with these sessions is I um with uh the help of Mata um I after the session is over there's as you can see there's a lot of like wasted time I'm trying to fix a microphone um after the sessions over I um edit together some smaller videos that get posted in a playlist if you want usort to follow the sequence of this course okay I'm getting some I'm going to try one more thing other idea let's see how bad it is with this shirt oh [Laughter] yeah this is the other shirt I was wearing today so I was like oh I could just put it on and and then clip the microphone to this this is going to be crazy but let's just see if this even improves it the nice thing about this shirt is it's like clip it to the top of my laptop uh okay now it's actually not as seethrough as I thought it might be I don't know if this makes this watching this video way too distracting okay people seem to be enjoying the green shirt okay I'm keying live using a piece of software called wirecast which does the keying for me so I think actually looking over on my preview monitor it's not so bad you know I was using the neck collar but that didn't seem to work when I tried that let's see how's that I can take this shirt back off all right boy I hate these uh this also solves the standing in front of the code problem okay is this better now sound is much better now except I don't know where you are where okay uh where we are in the much much better on the collar awesome I'm glad to hear this okay so the first thing I'm going to do is talk about uh marov chains in general and I want to go to a couple things engrams Google uh oops um so uh where's the link to this uh sorry uh Google engram viewer there we go and rainbow unicorn uh unicorn rainbows uh Happy rainbows flying unicorns no valid engrams I uh I'm now I'm worried I'm There's issues again with the sound um okay uh it's fine now okay um uh okay power through um okay um okay so I'm sorry I'm trying to think of some phrases that would be relevant to uh have in this engram viewer um uh rainbow uh sorry I'm like so distracted by the uh sound problems um and I just keep like looking at the chat trying to figure out if it's good or not but I'm gonna I'm gonna power through for a little bit here okay um uh Happy code uh joyful code let's just do computer science creative code creative writing okay that sort of works um okay um okay so this is one thing I want to have open um sorry I'm getting myself set up here this is not my best uh let me look uh here for a couple other examples of things that were relevant uh this is one that I want to look at and this is one I want to look at um look at also this ITP course generator okay so and Harrison oh yeah this is good to see sorry everyone as always I always forget the this okay um so I'm ready for so what I want to do quickly is introduce this idea of a marov chain um and uh an engram and um um talk about the sort of overall content for this week then I am going to um then I am going to do a coding challenge where I program the Markov chain and then I will wrap up with some exercise ideas okay and so here we go everybody um okay sometimes I like to have these little musical bumpers hello uh this is programming from A to Z week seven I don't know what week I'm on hold on a second let's look here uh um session something or other uh this is my programming from a toz playlists uh week six so it's week seven um just in case you're trying to figure out where we are week one was an introduction week two is regular Expressions week three is libraries and uh apis week four was looking at node and twitterbots and week five text analysis and word counting ah I forgot to do so one of the things I try to do is I try to collect things that people are working on and show them at the beginning of the live stream and somehow I've forgotten to do that yet again so I'm really going to have have to commit to doing that next week okay so week session six I'm going to call it okay um hello welcome to session six or week six I don't know you doing this every day every week every month this could be year six for you if you wanted it to be but this is programming from A to Z it's a set of tutorials a kind of online course you could follow all about programming and algorithms with text text language text Words letters all that sort of stuff so um today uh in this week's session um the focus um will be about uh the focus that I want to have is markof chains whoa what's a markof chain what's what's a deal what's going on so in the last session um I focused on something uh the sort of topic of text analysis so in last week the idea was really exclusively about reading text in and analyze it analyzing it counting how many times different words appear uh trying to think about how you might do sentiment analysis what happens when a computer program reads in text I want to turn now towards what happens when a computer program writes its own text and there of course are many many ways that you could do this in next week's session I'm going to look at something called a context free grammar um in other sessions I hope to look at some machine learning techniques for generating text as well as other just kind of creative ideas for ways to mix and match and have a program put together text as if it's reading it now one thing I should say about this week's topic of marov chains is it by definition requires a source text from which to generate text so this is something you'll see in a lot of these algorithms for generating text they also include a reading text component so um the Markov chain algorithm is based on this idea of an nram whoaa edit mat has been very good at just like doing some jump cuts when I start to say things that don't make any sense and I want to uh have a little like jump cut edit point there um I don't know when I clicked over but I'll just leave it back over here now a marov chain is not something exclusive to the idea of text and in fact a marov chain really just describes a sequence or a chain of States like I am happy I am sad I am running and I might typically on any given day be sad and then I start running and then I feel happy and that's kind of my sequence so what H um with a marov chain looking at how certain states are sequenced and the probability of a given State following another state um we can use we can evaluate sort of existing data right I can look and say like oh you know what's the the weather like today what's the weather like tomorrow what's the weather like the next day over a year and try to use that to either predict the new weather or to recreate a simulation of weather based on the sequence of States so this is something I'll look at more in more detail in the next um video but there's a piece of that which is if I want to apply this idea of a marov chain to text what I want is for the characters are words of a piece of text to be States for example the state is I I the next state is M the next state is feeling the next state is like dancing so those are states and the you know whenever I say am I usually say feeling and then whenever I say feeling I usually say like you know but I might say the other day I I'm feeling like eating some kale salad or something like that too so this is this is like quite possibly the worst explanation of markup chains ever on the internet but uh you can skip to the next video where I'm sure it will make a lot of sense but um a piece of of evaluating the statistical properties of characters and words how they appear next to each other is this idea of an engram so this will also be a piece of the example that I buil today of how do we look at a body of text and look at this idea of engrams now Google has this massive Treasure Trove repository of Text corpus of text from you know 1800 all the way up until present day and you can search for the frequency of certain NRS so these are what it might be called byrs meaning two computer science creative code creative writing we could think of other ones like I am and I could search for any of these uh diagrams and their frequency in text and we can see that computer you can see first of all computer signs started to appear more and more frequently in starting the 1960s you can see a sort of more consistent amount of I you can see creative writing creative code down here so this is a way of looking at um how how and we can look at trigrams engrams with an order right an order of four the order referring to the number um and uh you can do creative projects with this so here's a great project by Chris Harrison called Web trigrams visualizing Google's triam data and we can see here if we just look at this uh PDF and I'm going to zoom into it so you can see you can see here that that uh in this project the uh Chris is visualizing all the words that tend to follow he and then from there all the words that tend to follow that so um another I think this these are some nice examples to look at and you can kind of here imagine now um I have a I am not I was not I do not I can a so you can sort of see the frequencies of these sequences and if you can evaluate those frequencies you can use those frequencies as probabilities from which to generate new text so here's an example of um a project made by Allison Parish uh the interactive telecommunications program is a program at ITP it's called it a program at ITP it is ITP it's where I teach um and we have courses Every Spring and what Allison did is read all of the courses into a program look at all the statistical properties of all the characters and words and how they appear next to each other and use that to generate new uh new courses so I'm going to um let's let's let's find one uh that that looks good uh the anthropologies of virtual design Workshop midi and cinematic objects this course constraints of weekly sessions Beyond exercises and Inspire the possible so um this sounds great I think I'll take that course um this is another example of a project um called King James programming and these are post generated by a Markov chain that has mixed several different input texts uh the King James Bi Bible structured interpretation of computer programs and some of Eric s Raymond's writings run by Michael Walker so you can see here these are uh different um things that are generated from that exercise 3.67 addresses why we want a local variable rather than a simple map as in the days of Herod the king okay so um there's a lot of possibilities for how you might use marov chains to for Creative output and on the one hand this is nothing new this has been done and done and done and done again this idea of reading in a source text evaluate the probabilities on a character or word based level and I'll talk about that as I implement the code in the next video and then text generating out of that you could make a Twitter bot that generates text based on a Markov chain so I I think there's value and hopefully you might enjoy exploring the idea and you might even just take the examples that I provide and find your own source text in but I think for you to think about what is the reason why you might do this where might it fit into an existing project I hear a walkietalkie I want um and um um and come up with some creative possibilities so in the next video I'm going to focus on the code how to write the code to implement a Markov generator I'm going to go through it entirely from scratch I'm and then I'm going to show you a few additional examples and then come back with some exercise ideas for things that you might want to try doing yourself after watching these videos and then I hope you'll share them with me on Twitter at shiffman or you can subscribe to the patreon to um to uh post the post your work in slack as well okay so um I will uh see you guys in the next video how is the sound on that everybody um the thing is I felt like that was kind of terrible but I I've been wanting what I thought would be useful was to have introductory videos for each week's session I need to go back and do um other ones uh for like the earlier weeks there sessions that I didn't do yet but whatever that'll have to do for now so um uh you know part of this is that I actually just did all this stuff this morning ITP in a class and it's like in a way I should be like this should be good because I practice it now I have a sense of what to do but I I I think that I lost my sort of spontaneous thing static made it a little bit bad a bit glitchy on occasion is it really I have another microphone I'm tempted to just use the other microphone let's see how that goes so hold on everybody um okay I'm going to try switching to a different microphone I'm muting this one so this is random this is noise pearly noise that is in the core random algorithm the actual random algorithm itself those numbers aren't related at all you pick like I'm picking random numbers between Z and 10 9 2 7 6 1 9 4 8 nine two one three I pick nine a lot apparently but with pear and noise I might pick numbers like this two three four three four five six five four five six seven five six seven five six S8 N8 s six this is like test test okay I'm now using a different microphone uh and you guys can tell me it's this is not theoretically not as nice a microphone but um hopefully it will work um is everything okay I hear sound is low that's no oh sound is low okay sorry about that now I have a different microphone I forgot that I turned the volume all the way down so in case I didn't um in case I uh um some like bad horrible thing happened okay good good check good okay a lot better all right so I'm going to use this other microphone now we'll see if the static comes back uh hopefully that's going to do the trick I'll put the um pearing noise song back on so this is random this is this is by Loop that is theand algorithm the actual random algorithm itself those numbers aren't related at all you pick like I'm picking random numbers between 0 and 10 2 I'm going to get set up to do the first coding shower 9 2 one three I picked nine a lot apparently but with pear and noise I might pick numbers like this four five six week six even though it's the seventh week per I'm going to do my ridiculous thing this is how I like to do it I like to download P5 JS every single time and then I like to go to the empty exam exle I put it in here and I like to say marov chain and now I want to open up terminal no that is this is that is is no that is so this isur noise that is noise noise that is noise so this isur noise that is noise noise that is so this is noise that is I'm in the wrong sorry everybody sorry everybody but with pear noise I might pick numbers like this we go this is like pear noise performance art okay we are getting closer now to looking at marov chains now I just need to open up the code um let me run at it let me find the code uh A to Z weeks six let's put this here um let's put this here oh Andrew I see you in the chat I didn't respond to your tweet yet but I will thumbs up I think that um so thank you for your help and I will respond to you uh update is ready okay guess I'll install the update uh go here I need the Library uh and okay sorry for all this this has really been quite slow where are we at now 37 minutes you guys are very patient I probably lost a ton of viewers with all this wasted time audio is still good I assume yes okay so I'm ready so this is the one thing that I'm trying to think about here is um is um I um I let's see what am I thinking about here I uh in some what I have been doing typically I'm looking for my whiteboard markers seem to have lost them oh they're over here I have typically um thought of tried to do shorter videos and many of them as opposed to one longer one and so I'm tempted to just do one video which shows you how to generate a list of all of the engrs in a piece of text and then follow that up with a video that does a Markov chain so in that sense it would be two parts but I am ALS and on the one hand I'm also tempted to just do the whole thing because it's kind of a single project um and so I don't know what to do but I think what I'm going to do is play by ear so I'm going to start this is going to be completed in two parts I'm going to discuss what a Markoff chain is what an NR is and then I am going to um and then I am going to uh implement the code for all of the above okay sorry uh if I'm a little bit quiet I am a little quieter than I was before I'm turning it up a tiny bit um okay uh so one thing I want to look up and I know the camera just went off I'm just uh want to go to this website so I want to just reference here very briefly at the beginning this wonderful article by uh Victor Powell which uh explains Markov chains visually through a set of animations so I'm not going to use this in my video I don't I want to feel like I'm appropriating this content um but I'm going to I'll put a link to it in the video's description and uh I wanted to plug it because this helped me really think about and understand Markov chains in a nice way um okay so here we go now it's time it's at what it's two o'clock I have about an hour so I have an hour to do this coding challenge so the video in the end will be somewhere between 20 minutes and an hour and we'll see so here we go um and I'm going to cycle this other camera and we're going to get started so I'm trying to think of I'll just leave it over here um okay here we go hello welcome to a another coding challenge this coding challenge is part of the programming from a toz course which is all about programming uh with text and so in this coding challenge I am going to implement from scratch a marov generator so I need to talk about what a this thing called an engram is I need to talk about what a marov chain is and then how I use a marov chain to generate text so I'm going to do all that and write the code from it in JavaScript from scratch in this video one thing I want to just plug or reference is this wonderful article online by Victor Powell marov chains visually explained if you're looking for a supplemental resource to sort of think about marov chains and how they work this is really terrific and I recommend you check it out so I'm going to come over to the Whiteboard first no I'm coming to empty space it's all black hello am I here yes I'm here I'm coming over to this whiteboard to talk about what a marov chain is so a marov chain is a sequence of States so what could those States be um actually in Victor Po's article uh he references you could think of the states of um a baby playing crying eating sleeping and you could imagine well what's the sort of typical sequence it does the baby first play then the baby eats then the baby sleeps and then the baby cries and that's kind of like a typical sequence but sometimes it happens in other ways right we could kind of boil this all down and make the States you know we could think of sort of this very like in a sort of cold mathematical sense and the states could just be a oh no no no no no this will not do I'll be right back um I think this will be edited out me wandering around here I'm looking for my Eraser I had this nice eraser that actually seems to work well and I've completely lost it um uh oh well I don't know where it is I'm GNA have to just use something else I have a paper towel where could it have gone I'm losing my mind oh thank you you guys can hear me that I'm looking for an eraser look a magical person from the other room brought me this eraser this is amazing oh look I erased okay thank you uh all right so now I have an eraser wow this is this is amazing I should always record with people in the next room listening in okay uh let's try this I could list states as simply letters a b and the idea of a sequence means there is always a transition a moment where the state goes from one state to another so we could think about here that ah a could become b or maybe a could stay as a and b could become a or b could stay as B so if these are all the possible states and their transition to another state and we said that there is a 50% chance of this happening or a 50% chance of this happening or a 50% chance of this happening or a 50% chance of this happening we could then create a sequence that matches these probabilities I could say start with a I could flip a coin heads it's a I could flip a coin heads it's a I could flip a coin Tails it's B I could flip a coin heads it's a I could flip a coin Tails it's B right so this idea here is that I am generating that sequence of States based on existing States and probability of an outcome after that so this is used for a lot of different kinds of systems you could imagine looking at financial data as a sequence of States scientific data weather patterns predicting an earthquake based on some set of sensor readings uh in and how they sequence that's this sort of thing so Markoff chains are used in a variety of fields to analyze a sequence of states and also generate or predict outcomes based on that sequence now what I want to use them for in this video is to think of text as a sequence of States so let's say I wrote the sentence this rainbow has a unicorn flying over it so on the one hand I could think of each character as a state so how many possible states are there well maybe there's 26 lowercase characters 26 uppercase characters different kinds of punctuation and I could say the state is T followed by H followed by I followed by S right followed by space followed by R followed by a followed by I right so I could think of this as a sequence of states on the Character level I could also think of this as a sequence of states on the word level well maybe there are however many tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of words in an in the English language each one of those could be a state the state is this followed by rainbow followed by has followed by a now in a small Corpus in a small Source text I won't see that many possibilities the word rainbow is the only word that ever follows this but if I were to evaluate a large body of text I would see this followed by rainbow followed by unicorn followed by this dot for JavaScript programming right and I might be able to say you know what comes after this a lot this rainbow and I could start to adjust these probabilities based on an existing Source text and this is the idea if we can read in a text look at what kinds of characters come after a given character and how frequently I can start to generate a text based on those probabilities but there's one more element to this right now I'm talking about just each state being a single character or each state being a single word but there is a concept I don't know why I'm coming over here I thought I had something for this there is a con don't have anything for this over here there is a concept known as an nram an NR being a contiguous sequence of characters or words a continuous sequence of text and an engram has something associated with it called an order we could say byrs being NRS of two or trigrs being NRS of three and when I say that I mean let's look at all of the trigrams in this particular sentence this rainbow has a unicorn here's a trigram th hii the next trigram is h i s the next trigram is I space I'm doing an underscore for space the next trigram is sore R so what I could do is actually consider the states not to be single characters not to be single words but byrams are trigrams are engrams with an order of four or five or six in other words I could say if the state is th thi what are all the possible characters that could follow that so what I want to do is read in a text make a list of all of the engrams in that text let's just say an order of three to start with all of the trigrams in that text and then for each triag make a list of all the possible outcomes then I have a statistical model of how the text is put together on a character level and I can use that statistical model to generate new text with those same probabilities and properties so this is what I'm going to start to build right now and uh the the I'm going to build it on the Character level and maybe I'll do a second video where I adjust it to to to work on the word level okay um here we go U this can be an edit point for Matthew I just want to make sure everything's working okay because I had sound issues before and I kind of went on for a while uh it was a unicorn Dan writing off view oh did I write stuff out of the view of the camera um how bad was it um sound was great everything was great I uh I'm taking a pause here Mato thank you for editing this together to see if there are any questions Andrew Kim writes I always thought the grams were words as a whole so yes it's typically like if you look at the Google book view or engrams it's typically um uh typically uh thought of that way but I'm going to do it on a character level which I think is a little bit more useful okay so I'm going to pretend uh I'm walking back into the other camera and keep going okay so let me do that again and I'm GNA keep going thank you Sasquatch for saying that was a great explanation of the concept I feel like I should just throw away that first video this was much better okay okay so whoops I stepped on something so um let's uh start programming this so I have uh a completely empty uh P5 sketch and I want to start with putting some text at the top where I will say uh this rainbow has a unicorn flying over it and I don't need draw and I don't need a canvas so the first thing I want to do is is simply make a list of all of the trigrams so I'm going to include a variable called order and I'm going to say order equals three and that's something we could adjust if later I want it to be byrs or engrams of order five that sort of thing and I'm going to just Loop through the text so what I first want to do is just look at every single character one at a time um uh text. length i++ and then what I want to do is pull out the trigram so I can see plainly that the first trigram is thi and the way that I can pull out a piece of a string from another string is with the function substring so I'm going to say VAR gram equals text. substring and I could say this right 0 comma 3 would give me thi now you might be wondering the index values are t h i s 0 1 2 3 why doesn't 0 comma 3 give me this an important thing to remember is substring the first index is included the last index is excluded so actually 0 comma 3 gives me th I three characters from 0 1 and two which is exactly what I want but I don't actually want to say 0 comma 3 what I want to say is I and i+ three because what I want as I'm looping is thi then h i s then I space then s space r that sort of thing and I can make a variable called n gs and I can make it an AR array and then I can say n gs. pushr and at the end here I can say console.log n GRS so let's run this code and this is just a simple piece of code to give me a list of every trigram in this particular piece of text and we can see there it is I can make this a little bit bigger for you in case you can't see that and you can see there are all those engrams now there's a little bit of a problem notice at the end t period and just period so those aren't trigrams those are just two character than one character that's cuz I let it Loop all the way to the end and I actually want to say uh minus order + one I think or I could just say less than or equal to text. length minus order so that should give me um r space i space it and it period so now we can see there's the list now here's the thing this is not a unique list of only of of the trigrams this is just a list of every single trigram but ultimately what I'm going to want to do and I'm GNA um come back over here is what I want to build is a big table I want to build a table where I have you know trigram ABC points at all the possible things that could come after it and trigram feeg um all of the trigrams that's not the alphabet EFG ABC and I forgot D AB bcde e f all the I know now I'm putting numbers here I got I kind of lost my train of thought there but I want to I want to build I want to build this table so what I need to do is pair a a trigram an engram with an array and guess what remember when I made some video about word counting when you said hey let's pair a string with a count and I used a JavaScript object as a collection of name value pairs we can do exactly this here only the and the name the fields the properties of that JavaScript object are the engrams and instead of having a count with how many times they appear I want to have an array with all the possible outcomes after that so let me come back over here and start implementing that in the code uh okay so um so first instead of having an array of NRS I want to have a um object yes an object and when I find a gram I want to ask does whoops does that gram already exist right if that gram already exists well let's just do a count for right now I could say you know increase um it's count otherwise uh otherwise uh set its count equal to one right if it doesn't exist set its count equal to one if it already exists and you know what I this is kind of silly of me but I feel like it's a little bit more readable if I write it this way right because if it doesn't exist set its count to one if it does exist increase its count so let's go back over here and see what do I get now unfortunately the text that I wrote everything only appears once so what I'm going to do is I'm going to artificially create some text where there's a bunch of uh things that appear multiple times uh so let's try I maybe you guys there there some people watching the live chat can suggest things for me to write so I'll write the theramin is theirs okay yes it is this is a theramin that's like the weirdest sentence but now at the very least if I run this again you can see that certain certain um certain trigrams appear many times like space I is appears three times space t appears four times uh uh this is in alphabetic order t h appears four times s comma space appears twice so we're seeing the frequency of these trigrams these collections of three characters so all I've done so far is make a nice little table which counts how many times the NRS appear but I want boy I want more what I want to do is what I've got over here I want to have um a list of things that come after and what do I mean by after is what's what whenever this trigram appears what's the character that appears after it so if I come back over here what I want to do is when I have found a new gram that I haven't seen before make an array the key the key for this um sorry here the key for this the value for this uh key in the object is an array and then of course what I want to do is put something in that array like the next character and what is the next character the next character is I + 3 push text car at I + 3 right because I'm looking at this sequence of three characters and the one that appears right after it is number is three later and then of course if I have already found it I don't need to make a new array I just need to push that character you can see there's some redundancy here so let's clean up that redundancy I can actually just say if it's not there make an array and then always push that other character in it so let's see what happens now if we look at what I'm storing in data okay look at this now look at this if I go down to th and look at that we can see look what are the possible things so after th I could have a space I could have an r or I could have an i and look at this R appears twice now in some cases when I'm Pro programming I'll see that R appearing twice and think this is not so good there's some redundancy here I should just have R in a count of two we did this for word counting right we didn't want a list of all the words with the words in there multiple times we wanted a list of the unique words and their count but there's something going on here which is that if this is my set of possibilities space r i r r what if I said to you pick one random possibility pick space or or r r or i r r well R is actually going to be picked 50% of the time I only 25% of the time and space only 25% of the time the mere fact that we are duplicating the possibilities over and overg again into the array the more times they appear the more likely they'll get picked when we generate text so this is actually a side effect that of having this redundancy that we actually want so this is really useful you could kind of say like oh this is inefficient it's wasted memory and I could store a number and I could do some other kind of math and all of that is true and I encourage you to go forward and and go forth and make a more compact version of this but the ease of doing it this way and come on these are individual characters think about how your computer stores images of millions of pixels and videos it's not that much of a memory overload there's a question of scalability and how much data you know etc etc but I think we don't need to worry about that right now this is going to work beautifully so let's look at this I'm going to come back over here right now and and we are getting there we have now space r i we have this list of trigrams and the letters that come after it so what I'm going to do now is I am going to build into this I'm gonna I'm going to add some stuff to this example I'm going to create a button uh because I what I want to do is have a button uh equals create button and I'm using some code from the P5 Dom Library which allows me to quickly mock up some interface elements uh and I'll call that gener at and then I'm going to say a button. mous pressed and I'm going to say uh uh Markov it so now I'm going to run the Mark I'm gonna now I need to write an algorithm to generate the text uh and then uh we will say create P the result so right now of course let's just make sure this works right now all I'm getting is the results but ultimately of course what I need to do is right here I'm going to write an algorithm that generates text based on uh the input so we have a question I mean I have a question you might have a question where how do we start right this is the text the theorin is theirs okay yes it is um how do is my grammar okay there I don't know I'm getting worried but um what do we start with um now this is a question that I will think about and talk about and maybe EV and think in later either in later in this video or in the next video because there's lots of different kinds of ways you might use a marov chain are you using a marov chain to generate short phrases or long bodies of text or how are you reading in the text are you reading in bunch of short phrases are you on the Character level the word level but for right now the simplest thing I'm going to do is start just with the whatever the first three letters whatever the first engram is of this text so I'm going to go down here and say VAR current gr equals text substring 0 comma order right I want it from 0 to three that's what I want to start with now what I want to look is say what are the possibilities the possibilities are n gs current gr right I want to look up what are the possible next characters with based on what the current gram is and that's what I've just built this whole object to have it has an array so now I can say next equals I want to pick a random element from that array and guess what P5 since I'm using the P5 Library it has a function called random if I pass it an array it gives me a random element from that array so it's going to pick that random function if it's this array it's going to pick space r i or R randomly one of those okay so once I have that I can say the result is um I can say the result is the current Gram Plus next and I can create P result so let's just look at this and do some generation there there there there there the the space there there come and I he thi so you can see I got R around 50% of the time I got space 25% of the time and I 25% of time not exactly of course because this is probability based and I could run this again we could see the you know R is going to come up more often but I'm getting all these possibilities and I'm standing in front of this so I'm going to uh move this over a little bit okay so now I only did it once though the point is once I've done this now I want to look at the gram heer and see what are the possibilities next and generate a new character then I want to look at er and whatever I picked there and then what are the possibilities after that so I want to do this I want to iterate and continue to do this over and over again so when do I stop doing this that's another question that has no a bunch of different possible answers but I'm gonna say right now basically what I want to do is let's just say I'm gonna do this 10 times I'm going to write a little Loop to do this 10 times and what I'm going to do a result needs to be uh kind of a a variable that's declared right the things that I need to do before the loop are pick the starting PHA starting gram and gram and start that result which is that starting end gram then uh I will only have to add the next character so what I'm doing is saying 10 times give me the possibilities then pick a random one and then added to the result but then I need to go and look at the next current gram and what is the next trigram it's the last three characters of whatever I've generated so far so I can say current gram equals text. substring text. length minus 3 text. length oh not text the current result right what I've generated so far right yes excuse me sorry uh text is the original string which is plays no role anymore the original string was simply used to build the table of engrams and their possible next States so now and I could um just to make this a little bit shorter just so you can kind of see it a little more easily uh I'm just going to write it like this so what I'm getting right is that I want the next gram to be the last three characters of the text so now if we do this whoops I have an error in line 30 plus result uh uh result plus equals next there I don't know what was going on there the thein the thein there's okay there thein is I so we can see here instantly how I've got these sequences of 10 characters that have the quality of the source text but they're randomly new uh this is going to be like an edit point because I'm trying to think of what to do next um so I think um okay um I'm trying to think here what time is it by the way 222 I'm doing well on time okay so what I want to do next is make maybe bring in some different text into this um so let me actually get that prepared um let's go to unicorn Wikipedia um and I'm just going to like grab some text uh just have it like prepared so MAA this part doesn't need to be in the video and um I can copy paste this in um okay so what I'm going to do is grab that text and then what I'll do also is look I will uh I'm also going to go and do the name generation thing um wa it's 80 degrees it's I finally got to the point where it was always cool in here and now it's like super hot again uh um just do this okay um yasu to Greece T Kane did I say that right uh okay oops I'm on Twitter for no reason uh I lost here we go uh okay so um I'm gonna make an edit point um I'm going to make an edit point to come in and paste new uh text in sorry I'm reading the chat you guys are talking to each other not me okay let's grab some different text and see what happens so I've got already here pre premade like text about unicorns from uh Wikipedia because I don't have any other ideas and I'm going to uh comment this out and just say VAR txt equals and paste this text text in and keep the order at three let's allow the engra let's allow it to generate 50 characters in length and let's refresh and hit generate uh we can see uh what do we get the erroneously Beast with the Unicorn is of nature the Y of narwhal with a symbol of the Unicorn W uh and you can see it just sort of cuts off I can I can um let me actually Let It Go for longer if it can as well as let's make the order six oh okay so we got an error so this this is not so this is quite likely to happen so first of all what there's all these crazy numbers in there so I can tell you what the error is which is that if it can never if if this possibility is this is somehow undefined then this random function won't know how to pick something from an array because there's no array and the random function actually is meant to give you a random number so that's why I slly got a random number in there so one thing I can do to just add a little protection here is say if um if not possibilities meaning if it's not defined uh then break and so this is a way of having the this can be edited out also this is a way of having the marov chain end if it has no more possibilities so let's do this and uh I think the issue that I've got here is oh you know what I did actually I hardcoded in the number three so I this should really be order right because I'm changed the order meaning the the length of the NR so I can't just have you know use the number three anymore down there that's a big problem okay so now let me run this generate oops um hold on did I save this and uh hold on this might need to get edited out as well oh it's still doing three so where else do I have hardcoded three oh I have hardcoded three here thises make this easier for edit mat mat to edit oops I also put the hardcoded number three in up here oh this is awful you guys in the chat are already telling me this so now I can hit refresh it's not over yet where else oh look I have it over here I think this is going to work now y there we go so you can see here I'm getting with a with an order of six I'm going to get much I'm going to get less nonsense right because it needs to have sequences of six characters that actually appear in the original Source text and so but if I were to give it something like an order of two we can see we're going to get a lot more nonsense like the in its grow the SYM wi okay so this is my favorite word right here anybody that's I got it that's the name for this channel coding rainbow okay so um so you can see that there's a lot to play with here so on the one hand this video is over and in fact it is over I'm going to in the next video look at a few different scenarios of using a Markov chain um to generate long text versus short text and in the next video what I'm going to do is um try to use a Markov chain to generate um uh a new name for this YouTube channel so hopefully I'm going to publish the code with this obviously um it'll be linked in the video description and um I look forward to seeing what kind of source text you might use that's different than the source text I'm using and um what kind of uh how you might present the outcome is are you kind of appropriating another design to make it appear as if it's generating news headlines or you creating a Twitter bot that generates text using a Markov chain there's a lot of possibilities there and I hope you will share with me your results thanks for watching okay um so so I I chickened out of like just letting this video go and go and go and go and go I'm looking at the time 230 um got another half an hour here so what I want to do I'm trying to decide if I want to pull dynamically from this Google sheet so I don't know why I have a separate um so this is currently a um set of name just making sure there's nothing too awful in here um uh okay so this is currently by the way if you're if you're somebody in the chat can post um U can post a link to this Google form which I posted a while ago um and if people want to keep submitting name ideas uh please do so either way I kind of feel like I want to have a some sort of contest maybe like of course I'm probably just going to name the channel the joy of coding I can't come up with anything else but if there was a different name that I picked and somebody suggested I would love to like give out a prize for that I don't know what the prize would be free programming books some stickers in a tshirt I don't know um so uh but um let me look here and I think what I should do is just load this from a file um because I think all the code that I'm going to add add to load it from oh why chicken out let's load it from a Google spreadsheet no let's load it from a file uh okay um so what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy this I'm going to create new file and I'm going to call it uh names.txt and I'm going to paste whoa it pasted a lot of EXT ex ra nonsense oh my goodness seriously oh no it's just or is it just that um I have my preference set for to let myself scroll below right hold on hold on everybody I'm going to just paste these there we go okay so now I have a um a list of names so what I'm going to do now is is oh let me I'm sorry let me make a new sketch just to um uh Markov chain Das names um and let me go here back markup chain names and um so and let me close all these and let me go here so what I want now is to load in okay okay I I think I know what I'm going to do and I'm just going to get started let me cycle the cameras oops I left the other one off for no good reason okay how would this code um Alan in the chat asked how would this code behave If instead of letters it would generate every NR another nram um that's interesting I don't actually have an answer for that it's an interesting question and I would be happy to explore that but I would say give that a try and see what happens and let me know okay so what I'm going to do now is uh pull from a list so I'm GNA um let me move this file into here um coding Paradise I kind of like that coding balloon the joy of code joy of coding uh but I miss any really good names people are probably adding some let me just really quickly let check to see if there's any new names I should make sure to add in oh there's a bunch um and I'm gonna come down here and I think maybe I'll take out Barbara and Paul I don't mind high so much I think it's going to cause a problem because it's going to be too short okay um okay so here we go I'm in this next video okay so I think these will be like a coding challenge 0.1 Point 2.3 kind of thing so no I can't think of a better way to do it okay hello in this video I'm going to see if I can come up with a new name for this YouTube Channel cuz I need a new name and what I'm going to do is I'm going to generate one using an algorithm called The marov Chain now if you watched the previous video then I spent a lot of time talking about what a marov chain is and building the code for a marov chain from scratch one thing I didn't do do however which this video will focus on is how to use a marov chain to generate a short phrase so in this sense what I'm going to feed into the marov chain is many many examples of that short phrase so you could use city names or character names or thesis title ideas or course title ideas I'm thinking of like like school stuff because that's what where my brain is at but you know YouTube channel names so um here are a bunch of uh YouTube channel names that came in suggested from the viewers through a Google form now I could actually connect to the Google form directly and I have a example that shows you how to do that but I think for right now for Simplicity sake this is just in a text file called names.txt so I'm going to go to the marov chain code no longer do I want to have the hardcoded text about the Unicorn or the theramin instead what I want to do is I'm going to make a variable called names I'm going to add the preload function so in P5 the preload function is a function where I can preload data files like images sounds and other kinds of data files and I'm going to say names equals load strings names.txt so if I do this and I'm just going to say console log names I'm going to get lots of weird errors because I took out a bunch of other things um I should see oh I don't see any oh yeah that's what I do I'm going to see this array of all the I have an array of all the names that people suggested and there's some other errors so now what I need to do is I need to do this so This NRS remember this NRS variable stores the table of everything so what I need to do is instead of having one piece of text that I feed into the model the NR table um the barov model table thing to call it um I need to do that through a loop so what I need to do is I need to put an outer loop so I'm going to say uh for VAR J equals z J is less than names. length j++ and I'm going to put a loop around all of this and then what I'm going to do is this inner loop is the thing that adds stuff to the NRS model what I'm going to do is say VAR text equals names index I so I'm going to add each line from that text file one at a time to the model the reason why I want to do this is I want all of that to be part of the Poss possibilities however one thing that's not built into my code is well how does a name begin a name could begin with c c o d Jo y c o d t h o d e w n so I want to keep a separate list of actual possible Beginnings for the generation process so on the one hand I'm kind of done here like it um the thing that won't work let me run this uh cannot Le read property length of undefined sketch. JS line 17 let's see what the error is uh ah H oh names index J boy that's bad and j++ so remember the outer loop is J so I'm looking at each there is no I so that worked and you can see I'm getting a nice big list uh with all the sort of possibilities that table is working if I hit gener though I'm going to have an error and that error is txt is not defined because how I was able to how I started the generator was with just the first three letters or whatever the order is of that seed phrase now what I think that would make sense to do is I need to I want to create I'm going to call it Beginnings I don't know if I've mentioned this by the way that this most of the all the code that I'm writing is based on python code written by Allison parish and I'll make sure to credit her in both the previous video and this one I guess I'm mentioning it now I should have mentioned it in the first one um so thank you Allison for that code that at some point I looked at a couple years ago when I first started doing this stuff um okay um so I that was implanted in my head two years ago and it's coming out right now I guess there might be some differences never mind okay so I what I want to do is have an array uh called Beginnings which are what are the possible Beginnings so each time I look at a name the first gram is a possible beginning so if if I equals z beginnings. push gr so I want to keep track of an extra list of all the possible Beginnings meaning here is the table of all of the engrs and possible outcomes and if I look at Beginnings here is an array of all of the possible ways that a name could begin and again there's redundancy here and why are they all two characters instead of three oh my n must be two the N is two okay that's right um I was going to start with three so if I do this again and hit Beginnings we could see yeah so these are all the possible ways that a name could begin and there's redundancy in there but I like that because I want my names to begin with the same probabilities as my input data so now what I'm going to do is down here here the current gram just needs I just need to pick a random beginning So Random Beginnings so I just pick a random beginning and that's where I start and then I let the algorithm just go so let's run it and see what I get coding codes and unicolors coding time rainbows shiftman's rainbow coding heres and dis spectrum of colored orange yellow code Kiton that in that so you can see have we found something yet I think first of all a couple things one is I should probably limit the name to about maybe 15 characters I don't know maybe let's limit it to 20 and uh maybe let's make the order two because it's making too much sense coding blander cande unic coding happy recod ey coding pitchy code Cod the K Dr coding OD rating C so you can see here that this is working but what the order is is really going to affect um affect the sort of the this. show coding balloon coding meteor meteorological P Happy Jumpy Dancy codes and so uh that order might be too high I might only be getting literal the sort of literal names and another thing here to point out is this would be much more probably interesting if I had a data set of a 100,000 names that I could use um you know something you might try is to you know what's your input data come up with what the thing you're trying to name see if you can find a really big data set maybe have a slide where you can adjust the order so the the user can actually pick what that order is as as the user is generating text from it so I don't know if we've come I really thought that at the end of this video I'd be able to do this and now the new name of this channel is you know let's just say it's okay hold on let's make the order three that's kind of in between let's just say it's for the rest of today the name of this channel is drum roll Joy of light appearing D # jooy of light appearing D see you all in another video I I have some more stuff that I need to talk about which is looking at uh generating Markov chains for longer pieces of text perhaps as well as uh on the word level I think would be worth taking a look at as well okay um all right people in the chat are telling me to update the list um all right we're going to have to take out some not familyfriendly uh uh suggestions oh I think I got most of these already um I'm a little worried about what that might generate nervous coding works for me uh I can add a few more names in uh and let's see what we get uh space space of code kitchen did somebody space of that just came out of nowhere that's the magic of doing this uh what did I want to do here I wanted to change the order again to uh two uh hammerin harrin bowerland arcs life dan. plasted okay so you get the idea I play with this on my own later the D is always appearing um okay so uh Joy of coding it is once again uh okay so how I think that I am closing in on let's let me think so I I think I should uh look at doing this on the word level H let me look at my existing examples so give me a second here as always I always forg here I have an idea I'm gonna play this song just for a little bit Joy of cod Joy of [Laughter] coding right see that's that's a new version of the song it [Laughter] works uh okay uh um okay so now what I'm looking for is uh I want to just look at my existing example um oops on a different port uh marov okay so I think that I have successfully kind of talked through this example um I love how much you guys love the this dot song I need some more who out there wants to make some music and remixes of things I'll do anything um okay um what am I looking for here um um okay so ah yeah so this is all these are all good things to look at the by word thing do I have maybe I should at least do a part three which does this by word let me look at my code and see what the difference is I think this is going to be pretty easy to do um um uh oops no I want to keep that running um okay marov by word so this is code that I've written before and what I do is just do it with an array of tokens I don't feel like doing this now I think I'll come back to doing the um uh I I think I will come back to um um I think I will come back to this stuff later I'm going to do a wrapup video and show some other examples um so let me do a wrapup week six and um talk about homework ideas um oh I I didn't update I'm have to go to my old site um uh hold on everyone week seven markup chains so these are some exercise ideas uh oh yes of course I can't believe I didn't think of that okay so um I didn't even mention that in class today okay so I think I'm wrapping up now I'm going to be here for about 10 more minutes and um I am going to um kind of do a wrapup video to show a few more examples and um close this and um to do a few more examples and um talk about some homework exercise ideas sorry I've lost my I've lost my train of thought uh okay so this is going to be the last uh video of today uh I will be once again live streaming next Tuesday around the same time in the afternoon um and I know that some of you are asking me to update my list I will run I'm going to run this a lot more later to see if I get anything good and I'll publish the code and you guys can run it as well and maybe what I'll do is actually hook it into the spreadsheet when I publish the code so that people can play around with it to see if they come up with any names or hook in their own spreadsheet um okay so I'm going to do a Wrap Up Video to talk about um exercises that you could think about doing if you happen to be following this as like a course which you may or may not be doing and then uh I will be gone for the day I will say however that I'm actually going to do a little bit more recording uh it just won't be live streamed as some of you know I posted an interview with Claire Kerney vpy and chansy Fleet about accessibility en coding so I'm working on more guest interviews and guest tutorials and I'm hoping to get another one done this afternoon so there will be another video with a surprise guest um that I will be um that I will be uh uh publishing as well soon okay so here we go um thank you guys for tuning in I'll take a few questions after I do this last uh programming from A to Z wrap up of week five um video week seven session SE six whatever it is okay okay so maybe you've watched my videos so far about engrams and marov chains and that sort of thing and you're thinking what what's the next step for you what could you possibly make so on the one hand I think the assignment or the exercise for this week it's really legitimate to not program anything new in in fact a lot of using a marov chain to generate text is about two things outside of the actual algorithm itself number one it's what source text are you picking and why are you picking that Source text and number two is what are you presenting to uh a reader a viewer a user an audience and what medium are you presenting it in are you using a marov j chain to generate dialogue for a performance are you using a marov chain to generate tweets are you recreating you know news artic and the project about designing a news like website that looks like real news but actually it's marov generated news there are a lot of possibilities there using a marov chain to generate text is not really a novel idea at all and you'll see I'll try to link in this video's description to lots of existing projects that use this technique that you can also find for experimentation now here's the thing though I have some additional examples that you know the videos that I made that you if you watch the Markov Chain video previously I'm just implementing the sort of raw algorithm and doing this kind of simple not simple but doing the sort of basic implementation of it so one thing I want to do and that's this example that's trying to generate coder full Coden bows that's kind of awesome fifm raying shift so you can see there's some new names that I'm trying to think of for this channel now um I do have some premade examples that if you go to the link to the a toz uh GitHub repository you'll see I want to highlight some of these number one and these are uh by the way this is a markup chain example that does something much like my YouTube channel naming and it just takes naming of names of lots of media art programs and uh creates uh names so let's if we get anything good sentle program and arts and media arts and Code Media Arts prograded Technologies program uh creations and Entrepreneurship anti disiplina Technology Program scent technology people um so you can see computer action that's pretty great so you can see this is the kind of thing for naming you can also look at my second example and try to find the differences right between generating short text this reads Mary Shell's Frankenstein from Project Gutenberg and generates kind of an actual very very long text with paragraphs and everything written in the quote unquote style which isn't exactly accurate but uses a mark of change to generate a new text so you might look at those and look at the difference between short text and long text both of those examples are generating text on the character by character basis so when I say a trigram I mean a collection of a sequence a contiguous sequence of three characters and three characters but you can also do this by word so you can consider the tokens not as individual characters but as words a rainbow is Rainbow is a is a meteorological so this is an example that instead of using sequences of characters using sequences of words and you can see the result here in a primary rainbow with inverse order of its colors reversed so um at some point I could go back and do another coding challenge to implement it by word if people are interested in that but right now I might just refer you to this code example another thing you might think about is what are other tokens or things that happen in sequence in text for example this text is not just this sequence of characters or this sequence of words it's actually a sequence of parts of speech verb noun noun verb determinant adjective adverb I'm getting that in the wrong order but what this actually does is evaluate the contiguous sequence of parts of speech use a Markov Jane to change a g generate a sequence of parts of speech and then pick words that are parts of that parts of speech to generate the text and the result here you can see is the Observer it reaches the meteorological set the raay section in a section and 40 to 42 degrees percent or more in the system between an arc and 50% etc etc so you can take a look at that example as well another thing you might think about is mixing two texts within a marov chain right what if I generate this uses if I take the slider all the way over here this is generating text using a markof chain only from Midsummer Night Dream this is now generating text only from my nature of code book and now if I kind of put it like over here let's see if we can generate something good uh that's a little bit too Shakespearean um let's let's let's give it a little more nature of code uh do it again unto his point numbers rather voice versions when program how do I knowledge about that we add one we can be the mouse location strong prevailment of the true for both x's and dispose of z0 We Still of this kind wanting but how to my Conde of length one then have our motion the close to your youth to one okay anyway I got a little too caught up in like pretending I'm like acting Shakespeare with my marov chain but anyway so you can see that's you might think about what if you're mixing two texts three texts how do you adjust the probabilities I'll give you a little hint behind the scenes if the probability if I want the probability of the Shakespeare text to be higher I just feed the Shakespeare text text in multiple times again it's not the most efficient way of doing this but it works you could think about other ways that you might do that um um you can get you can use a Google sheet I have a Mad Libs generator that pulls data from a Google sheet you could do the same thing with a Markov chain you could pull from an API I have an example that pulls from Reddit um and then also I should mention of course that even though I'm using my own Markov generating code based on code written in Python by Allison Parish um you could also use the Rita Library which has a Markov generator built into it and I have a previous video that I should link to in this description all about the Rita library and encourage you to look at that and see its implementation um so um these are things that you could think about I made a little list here also that I'll reference um so on the one hand just generate what's your own existing text what's your own what's what's order you're picking how are you presenting it um you could think about just sort of visualizing the frequencies or the the the possible pathway uh this web trigrams by Chris Harrison is a project I reference you can see this visualization of those uh of those engrams is something you might think about um and then I talked about mashing up two text the gretry project is another useful reference that I'll have a link to and then the other thing that I think is really important to mention is even though this course and this set of videos are I'm focusing on this idea of text and the characters or words being States and this continuous sequence of States this Markov chain you the units of the Markov chain don't have to be text what if they are musical notes or rhythms or colors or uh vectors what other types of visual designs or sounds or music could you generate through a marov chain so I hope you will think about making something with this uh you can share it with me at shiffman on Twitter you can share it in the comments here and you can also if you feel so inclined support the channel uh through patreon that's a if you want to make a financial contribution and um then you can also share and get feedback um through a slack channel that is for patreon subscribers okay so come back here hello okay so can you all see me okay um sorry I'm having trouble seeing the chat um okay I am back I you should be hearing me in both channels now that's a a wirecast glitch that I have to change a setting and it will never save that setting no matter what I do um okay so let's see if I can get through now um please help me in the chat what was the last thing I said before I froze um um I I heard maybe I I mentioned the ganry project I did did I not talk about how you could use a Markov chain with musical notes or pixel colors thank you for watching oh I did say that did I get that far okay hold on a second I I don't know why I'm asking because I have a recording I will look at my recording uh let me look at the recording because if I got all the way to thank you to for watching then I'm good code Bas you also it's very hard to get to the end here markup don't have to be text what if they are musical notes or rhythms or colors or vectors what other types of visual designs or sounds or music could you generate through a markup chain so I hope you will think about making something with this uh you can share it with me at shiftman on Twitter you can share it in the comments here and you can also if you feel so inclined support the channel uh through Paton that's a if you want to make a financial contribution and um then you can also share and get feedback um through a slack channel that is sorry I'm watching myself okay so you can't see it though ah okay so like it's just like a weird awkward cut off but I did get uh I did get everything and the camera shut off so um I'm just going to like record uh um me saying the last thing about patreon and slack and if um Matthew will figure out what makes sense how to edit it uh edit it um together uh uh welcome to people of all ages and from all parts of the world it's so exciting and nice to um see you guys okay so um um I am going to uh do that now and then I'll take a few questions and then I have to run but I'm hoping to record more let me actually check my let me just do that that now before I forget okay so um uh what was I saying um I was something about the slack oh and if you feel so inclined you can subscribe to the uh patreon uh Link in this video's description and uh with uh subscribing to the patreon which is a financial contribution I'm like I hate doing the plugging the patreon thing and now I just like feel so awkward doing a special thing just for that so but I'm just going to do it anyway um um I really could just record thank you for watching which I think is all that that end of that video needed um so by the way I hear some I heard when I played it back I heard a little bit of clipping like like it the audio buzzes when I speak kind of loudly I don't know if you guys are noticing that um okay you can also uh subscribe to this Channel's patreon there's a link in the video's description if you would like to make a financial contribution of course that's optional but with that you can get membership to a slack Channel where you can also share your assignments and get feedback from a community of folks in the slack channel so thank you so much for watching I look forward to seeing what you make from this and look forward to seeing you I don't actually see anybody when I'm doing this I'm just staring at a camera but it feels like I am so I look forward to seeing you in the next video okay bye bye uh okay great so I think I'm done for today uh um I'll answer a few questions in the chat Emily mcau asked do you know any c languages not languages written in C tongue Emoji um I don't know what if I don't know what to how exactly to answer to this but I do have some experience programming in C++ and in just plain vanilla oldfashioned C programming um and I used to do a lot of that I would say prior to 2005 when um things like processing weren't around frankly um um and I One Thing I would say for and I mentioned this before but for those of you who are interested in C++ and kind of creative applications using C++ I would take a look at open Frameworks as well as Cinder which are two creative coding Frameworks um uh there's a question that says I heard marov chains are used in neural networks how does it work backing away slowly as the S question with the neural network comes up oh boy I'm really planning to make some videos about neural networks it's going to happen uh soon uh uh hopefully before the end of the year and more in the spring um one thing I'll say is that there are a lot of uh sort of text generation experiments and things happening these days there was a movie script that was written through text generation and so I think um in the same way that you can train the marov chain to analyze an existing body of text and look at the sequence and probabilities to generate new text there are ways to do the same with a neural network in that you can feed a neural network text the neural network can try to create some type of model of the qualities of that text and generate new text out of that model so this is something that I do hope to explore in a future video I that for like I'm like a politician not answering the question what are all the programming languages you know C C++ Java JavaScript that's it I think uh can you do a coding challenge for an incremental clicker I don't even know what that is uh but I would be glad to it to do so um uh people are asking in the chat just to remind you if you want email notifications for when I do a live stream coding.com please uh if you feel so inclined subscribe to the channel and watch the videos that's actually one of the things that you can do if people have also asked if they could contribute and I'm always looking for people to subtitle or translate the videos uh to help make them more accessible um which um so if you're interested in helping with that please reach out to me it's pretty easy to do you can do it directly on YouTube um oh I know PHP yeah I know PHP no I don't really do R Ruby python or Lua but I'm interested in all those languages uh Python's awesome right uh can you still buy stickers yeah those stickers those stickers are still for sale uh I still have a lot of them I don't know if at some point I'm GNA have to take that down but get them now if you want the stickers uh chatbot could be a subject related to this yes something I'm really interested in doing by the way I just got one of those Amazon Echo things and I'm interested in doing some kind of text to speech uh I wanted to do a video about how to make a skill for the Amazon Alexa and I was going to make a Harry Potter Sorting Hat based on a twitterbot that Darius kazmi made called the Sorting bot uh super collider I a little bit of Arduino experience I hope to have some guests do some physical Computing videos on this channel at some point I'm looking for I'm kind of trying to I'm having guests do topics that I'm not as experienced with like 3D and Arduino and that type of thing I guess I know HTML CSS if those are programming languages we could have a discussion how long have I been learning to program well I like the way you asked that question because I'm still learning to program always be learning to program there's no you know JavaScript by the way i' never programmed in until like a year and a half ago or two years ago I can't remember now at this point but I really didn't program seriously until uh two I don't know if seriously it's the right word but I didn't really program till 2001 I had done a few classes in middle school and in high school and in college but I had never really taken to it or made anything with it until I started as a student at ITP that program where I teach now um a tutorial on how to make a gooey interface in CP uh a video about Hamming distance boy all these suggestions of things that how do I see JavaScript in 10 years uh it won't exist anymore I don't know I I don't know I don't like to predict the future I like to just enjoy the stuff that I'm learn that's happening now and that I can uh kind kind of play with is there a webbased P5 IDE there is one in development it's very far along we are Alpha Testing it at ITP unfortunately we're just not ready to have sort of like a large number of people using it but um I would expect it to come in early 2017 our goal is to have it out for the spring semester uh yes I want to do steering stuff with neural networks and uh reinforcement learning is something that I'm really hoping to be able to tackle I don't know how to do it so I have to figure it out I've been reading and researching browser automation I'm I am going to do Chrome extensions at some point this fall um okay so you guys are giving me a lot of great suggestions I am going to play my Goodbye music um when this song ends I will cut off the stream and do some like always with the rainbows if you have suggestions for a um channel name I'm all ears right now thinking about Joy of coding I need some new design stuff uh Scott wooden who did all the logo uh and website design um hopefully he'll he might be available to continue to do that work but if anybody wants to contribute or has ideas I'm welcome I'm uh I am uh would love to hear um hello Ireland hello coding pism yes I like coding rainbow as well coding prism maybe is what you meant um welcome new listeners viewers um I will be back next Tuesday afternoon um some around the same time probably in the 130 to 400 Eastern Tander time hour um Harry Potter invisibility with that shirt that's a great idea um and we'll see what we'll do um and um that's that rainbows and unicorns may you find them in your life in your week hope you spend some time outside with friends with people not programming or programming with people I was outside walking in the park in New York City the leaves were changing it was beautiful there were ducks and I have to say as much as I enjoyed riding a marov chain I I enjoyed the Ducks and the leaves almost just as much uh hello to Berlin uh I um um I Am a Unicorn this this today's stream wasn't about Markov chains if you missed it um the archive of this live stream will make its way onto YouTube at some point soon as well as edited versions of the videos today fun fun function is a great uh other YouTube channel and here we go I've got about uh I don't know how much longer this song has a minute left uh hello New Zealand I've never been to New Zealand and I would love to go there coding Unchained uh thank you for the stream you're welcome de Deca catron um Nepal that's wonderful hello Nepal this is a part of the the live stream where I just say hello to various countries Brazil India um and I will see you guys next week what else context free grammars make some stuff um share it with me I I really somebody remind me on Monday to gather on the slack Channel or over Twitter things that people have made Twitter word counting and marov chain stuff so I can show a few viewer created projects um on the live stream next week okay uh hello Belfast hello us and Mexico City and the Netherlands and I'm signing out from sfpc in the West Village and I'll see you all soon crap
