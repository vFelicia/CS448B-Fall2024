With timestamps:

00:00 - so in this video I want to summarize
00:01 - some exercise or homework ideas that you
00:03 - can do with this uh topic of word
00:05 - counting and uh text analysis so um
00:08 - number one if you make something please
00:10 - share it with me Twitter at shiffman you
00:12 - can put it in the comments here or if
00:14 - you're part of the uh patreon crowd
00:16 - funding which you can check a link in
00:17 - the description to find out how to do
00:18 - that we've got a slack Channel where you
00:20 - can share and discuss your assignments
00:22 - so mostly the first thing you might try
00:24 - is my example my um if I go
00:27 - back and look at this word counting
00:29 - example example uh it's just literally
00:32 - the word and their count so what might
00:34 - be a creative way that you visualize
00:36 - this and the other thing I I've said
00:37 - this before is think about what happens
00:39 - if you're doing multiple documents how
00:40 - much you compare them and in that sense
00:42 - the tfidf video could unlock some ideas
00:45 - for how you might present that but
00:47 - really I think what you want to think
00:48 - about is why are you doing this what's
00:50 - interesting to you about text what texts
00:53 - are passionate are you passionate about
00:54 - is there meaningful text that you've
00:55 - written that you want to look at in a
00:57 - new way and I would really encourage you
00:59 - to um take a look at pen Baker's
01:02 - research and the secret life of pronouns
01:04 - look at the website which will be linked
01:06 - in this video's description as well to
01:08 - what happens if you're really just
01:09 - counting a small subset of words and
01:12 - these function words these so to speak
01:13 - junk words how can you get how can you
01:16 - um uh could you create a sort of
01:18 - interactive lie detector based on the
01:20 - use of the personal pronoun I me or my
01:22 - based on that research and you'll see on
01:24 - the website there are a bunch of
01:25 - exercises and interactive systems that
01:27 - do this work already maybe you might
01:29 - have a Twist on that or create your own
01:31 - um another thing you might look at are
01:33 - word frequencies as compared you know
01:35 - your emails versus somebody else's
01:36 - emails can you find a match Luke DUIs
01:39 - has a wonderful project called
01:40 - Craigslist MI connections I might be um
01:44 - uh I'll link to that uh reference about
01:46 - that project hopefully in this video's
01:47 - description where what he did was look
01:49 - at Craigslist people will post like oh I
01:51 - saw you on the train and tries to auto
01:54 - match People based on the style of their
01:56 - writing is that something you could sort
01:57 - of think about figuring out how to do um
02:01 - and um that's that's I guess that's my
02:04 - kind of summary so you know you might
02:05 - look at sentiment analysis also if you
02:07 - have a pre uh pre- descri pre a pre-made
02:11 - set of words that are have a positive
02:13 - connotation or a negative connotation
02:14 - what happens if you count how many times
02:16 - those words appear in a certain text
02:18 - what types of analysis and also here's
02:20 - another idea um word counting emphasis
02:24 - on the counting not emphasis on the word
02:26 - what if you count syllables parts of
02:29 - speech sentences words that rhyme with
02:32 - rainbow I have no idea what it might be
02:35 - and is you know thinking back to Twitter
02:37 - Bots what if you do this kind of text
02:38 - analysis analyze stuff on Twitter using
02:40 - the Twitter API post that stuff back as
02:42 - a Twitter bot there's so many
02:43 - possibilities here you will be much more
02:45 - creative and interesting there's an idea
02:46 - in your head I know there is but even if
02:48 - there isn't just start messing around
02:51 - play don't even worry about what you're
02:52 - making you might discover something as
02:53 - you're like playing with the examples so
02:56 - create something share it with me I
02:57 - would love to know more about it and I
02:59 - hope to see you in um next week's
03:02 - session which I already forgot what it's
03:04 - about but oh I think I'm going to start
03:06 - moving on to text generation and maybe
03:07 - looking at Markov chain so that'll
03:09 - happen at some point the videos might
03:10 - already be there by the time you're
03:11 - watching this okay thanks and I'll see
03:12 - you
03:17 - [Music]
03:22 - soon
