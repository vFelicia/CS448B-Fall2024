00:01 - hello and welcome in this video I'm
00:03 - going to show you how to take a
00:04 - processing sketch and render it to a
00:06 - movie so this comes up a lot and there's
00:08 - probably a variety of ways that you
00:09 - could do this but I'm going to show you
00:10 - a particular technique that hopefully
00:12 - will be useful to you so I you know I
00:14 - picked this arbitrarily it's one of the
00:16 - examples from my nature of code
00:18 - materials um it is a a simulation called
00:21 - The Game of Life a cellular automata
00:23 - system automata boy I'm never going to
00:25 - get that right ever in my life um and
00:28 - it's just it's a a an AR animation but
00:31 - anything anything at all that you draw
00:33 - to the screen in processing you can
00:35 - render as a video out of processing why
00:37 - would you want to do this well there's a
00:39 - variety of reasons one is uh you might
00:41 - want to upload something to Vimeo or
00:43 - YouTube or some other um website to host
00:46 - a video uh you might want to bring this
00:49 - into another project maybe you're
00:50 - working on an animation in in something
00:52 - like after effects and you want to have
00:53 - some elements that you've programmed in
00:55 - there I can think of some I'll try to
00:57 - include some examples of people who have
00:58 - done this kind of work in the a YouTube
01:00 - description below so you might want to
01:02 - take what you're doing incorporate into
01:03 - another project in video form another
01:05 - thing might be actually that you just
01:07 - the thing that you made is beautiful but
01:09 - it runs incredibly slow and you want to
01:12 - you don't need it to run in real time so
01:14 - you could render it as a video so that
01:15 - it could run at 30 frames per second and
01:17 - play back as at a as an installation or
01:19 - whatever it is you might be doing so
01:21 - let's look at how you might do that and
01:23 - there's there's there's a bunch of steps
01:25 - to it um um and I'll try to go through
01:27 - them so the first thing that I will show
01:31 - oh and you know what this font is
01:32 - remarkably small so let me just show you
01:34 - in processing 3 I can go to the
01:35 - preferences I'm going to change the
01:37 - editor font to 36 and I think that's
01:40 - going to be a little bit better
01:41 - hopefully you can see that um okay so
01:44 - what's the first thing that I want to do
01:45 - to this so what I'm going to do is save
01:49 - so
01:50 - there's uh there there may be some other
01:52 - uh processing libraries you you can get
01:54 - to render directly to a movie file but
01:56 - what I'm going to show you how to do
01:57 - instead of rendering directly to a movie
01:59 - file you can always just save what's on
02:02 - the screen as an image so for example if
02:06 - I put save um the function
02:10 - save and I say um
02:14 - go.png right I'm just going to put that
02:16 - in draw and I'm going to run it you can
02:19 - see first of all I don't know if you can
02:21 - tell if it's running slower or not maybe
02:22 - it is maybe it's not I'm going to close
02:24 - this and I'm going to go to that sketch
02:26 - folder and you can see right there there
02:28 - now is a file called
02:30 - go.png and you can see it's a snapshot
02:32 - of what was on the screen now I was
02:34 - doing that in draw so it was doing it
02:36 - over and over and over again and what
02:38 - we're seeing now is just the last frame
02:40 - that it drew so the save function is way
02:43 - and you might put that in Mouse press or
02:44 - attach it you know you might at some
02:46 - point just want to use Save just to save
02:47 - a snapshot of what's on the screen but
02:50 - if you use the save frame function what
02:53 - the save frame function allows you to do
02:55 - is
02:58 - include the pounds symbol the hash
03:00 - symbol and what it will do now is
03:03 - autonumber the files so every time you
03:06 - call Save frame it's going to save
03:08 - goore one goore 2 so this now if I'm
03:13 - executing this in draw every time
03:15 - through draw I'm going to get a new
03:17 - image file and I'm going to run this and
03:20 - I'm going to try not to run it for very
03:21 - long oops did I leave it running because
03:23 - now I'm going to go in and be like oh my
03:25 - goodness and you can see there here it
03:28 - is I have a image file for every single
03:31 - uh thing that was saved uh every single
03:33 - frame now I don't like this this is kind
03:35 - of a disaster because I have a zillion
03:37 - files and it's polluting my file system
03:39 - here so I'm going to delete these and
03:41 - I'm going to show you what I think would
03:42 - be more useful to do I'm going to make
03:44 - just a directory I'm going to call it
03:46 - output
03:47 - SLG pound pound pound Pound and I'm
03:49 - going to run this and I'm going to let
03:52 - it
03:56 - run okay that was enough time and and uh
04:00 - now you can see I have this all here and
04:03 - I can just cycle through it and you can
04:04 - see there it is every single frame and
04:07 - by the way I'm using the PNG file format
04:10 - which will save uncompressed so this way
04:13 - the full quality is there in each and
04:15 - every frame this way later on you could
04:17 - choose to compress it or different codec
04:20 - whatever you want to do with your video
04:21 - that's a bit outside the scope so now
04:23 - the question is what do you do with
04:24 - these files so you could bring them into
04:27 - Final Cut Pro or iMovie or EG Studio 159
04:32 - zy Pluto magic thing rainbow I don't
04:35 - know is there rainbow in there whatever
04:37 - it is you can find your own software
04:38 - lots of software can take an image
04:40 - sequence After Effects will do this for
04:41 - you and render to a movie it so happens
04:43 - that if you want the sort of quick way
04:45 - of doing it processing up here under the
04:48 - tools menu under Tools there is a Movie
04:51 - Maker tool so if I go to click here
04:54 - Movie Maker and select it it opens up an
04:57 - interface that says this tool and you I
04:59 - don't know if you can read that this
05:00 - tool creates a QuickTime movie from a
05:02 - sequence of images blah blah blah it
05:04 - gives you a bunch of information all
05:05 - sorts of thing you can do what I'm going
05:07 - to do now is I'm going to go to the
05:10 - finder I'm going to find this output
05:12 - folder and I'm going to drag this output
05:14 - folder right here and then I'm going to
05:17 - look here and say like okay
05:20 - um my uh it's it's it's giving me a
05:25 - default height of 640 by 480 but I want
05:27 - to change that because my processing
05:29 - window it's self was 640x 360 what's the
05:32 - frame rate that I want oh and I guess I
05:34 - could have clicked same size as
05:35 - Originals in which case it would just
05:37 - use the size of the the file um and then
05:40 - I can pick whether I want to have some
05:42 - sort of compression I'm going to pick
05:43 - animation which basically means no
05:45 - compression so I'm going to get a very
05:46 - big file but I'll be able to bring it
05:49 - into some other software again if I'm
05:51 - using this in After Effects it's going
05:52 - to need to be recompressed later so I
05:54 - don't want to compress multiple times so
05:56 - I could also bring in a sound file if I
05:58 - wanted to include some sound with it I'm
06:00 - not going to worry about that and I'm
06:01 - going to hit uh create movie and it
06:04 - wants me to save it somewhere I'm going
06:06 - to uh put it on the desktop as testm
06:09 - movie. moove and hit save
06:12 - and did that already happen did it just
06:15 - like do it so
06:17 - fast normally it shows a little progress
06:19 - window but maybe I just had so
06:22 - little a test movie. move I'm going to
06:25 - open this up uh come on quick time and
06:29 - yeah oh so it just happened so fast you
06:31 - can see it there it is so now I have a
06:32 - movie file that I can save uh wow
06:35 - amazingly if it was longer you would
06:36 - have probably seen a little progress bar
06:38 - for it rendering it and you can see this
06:40 - is just a QuickTime movie that I'm
06:42 - playing fantastic so that's the basic
06:44 - gist of it uh in six minutes I kind of
06:46 - showed you the main piece but I think we
06:49 - could do a little bit more here because
06:51 - you might be in a situation where you
06:52 - want to start and stop the rendering to
06:54 - a file um you might want to uh be able
06:58 - to see some information on the screen
07:00 - whether it's rendering or not so I'm
07:02 - just going to add a couple more um
07:04 - pieces to this program just to make it a
07:05 - little bit more
07:07 - sophisticated okay so so one thing I'm
07:10 - going to do is I'm going to create a
07:12 - Boolean variable called recording and
07:14 - I'm going to assume that we're not
07:16 - recording When the program first starts
07:19 - so Boolean recording equals false so and
07:22 - then I'm going to say if
07:24 - recording this is where I should save
07:27 - those frames so the other thing I want
07:29 - to do by the way now that I finished and
07:30 - made that movie maybe you need backups
07:32 - and stuff but I'm just going to go and
07:33 - delete that folder because I don't want
07:35 - to save the previous uh I don't need to
07:37 - save those previous raw files I have
07:39 - everything that I need right here in
07:40 - quick time now and I will just save that
07:43 - um the the the movie file again um so
07:47 - now only
07:49 - if only if the Boolean variable
07:52 - recording is set to True will it
07:55 - actually save those frames that's a
07:57 - useful thing now what I'm going to do is
08:01 - say let's say what I want to do is uh
08:04 - have a way okay so if I say you know
08:06 - this isn't that interesting let's use
08:08 - key
08:10 - pressed so uh if I could say if key
08:13 - equals r or key equals capital
08:19 - r
08:20 - recording equals not recording so what
08:24 - this is going to do is when oh I I'm in
08:27 - JavaScript land I wrote function void um
08:30 - what this is going to do is it's going
08:31 - to say anytime I press r on the keyboard
08:33 - it will start recording or stop
08:35 - recording it's going to toggle the
08:36 - Boolean state of recording if Rec not
08:39 - true is false not false is true so
08:43 - recording equals not itself if it's
08:46 - false become true if it's true become
08:47 - false so that's going to happen there
08:49 - anytime I toggle it and you can see like
08:51 - if I run this program and I go to the
08:56 - files we can see that it's not record
08:59 - recording if I hit if I click in here
09:01 - and I hit R you can see suddenly new
09:04 - files are appearing if I hit R again
09:06 - those new files will have stopped so
09:08 - simply by adding a quick little
09:10 - something to the program I can kind of
09:12 - turn on and off the recording now also
09:14 - what would be nice here is for me to be
09:16 - able to see some visual indication on
09:18 - the screen as to whether it's recording
09:20 - or not so what if I just WR here I say
09:24 - okay um Phil uh red
09:31 - otherwise fill
09:34 - green and draw a circle I don't know at
09:38 - the middle of the screen towards the
09:41 - bottom that's like a circle so if we run
09:45 - this you can see there's a little green
09:48 - this is like terrible visual design but
09:50 - there's a little green circle there when
09:52 - it's not recording and when I hit record
09:54 - that Circle turns red when I hit record
09:56 - again that Circle turns green I don't
09:58 - know if those are the right colors the
09:59 - visual indicators you want but you get
10:01 - the idea I can toggle the color of that
10:02 - Circle and know whether I'm recording or
10:05 - not very useful but but are you thinking
10:07 - in your mind oh no there's a big problem
10:09 - I don't want a big ugly green or red
10:12 - circle in my video but one thing that's
10:14 - wonderful about the save frame function
10:17 - is it's going to save the current view
10:21 - of the processing window and guess what
10:24 - the circle is drawn after I call Save
10:26 - frame so save frame is going to save
10:28 - what's in the window window and then
10:30 - draw the circle on top of that that
10:31 - Circle won't get saved to the file so we
10:33 - should be able to see if I go back to um
10:38 - here and delete that I'm going to run
10:41 - this and I want to start recording for a
10:44 - little bit it's recording it's recording
10:46 - it's recording recording I want to stop
10:47 - recording and then I'm going to close
10:49 - here I'm going to go and look let's just
10:51 - look at these files no green or red
10:54 - circle so we've done it we're we're able
10:56 - to add a little visual indicator into to
10:59 - our window as to whether it's recording
11:01 - or
11:02 - not um I think that's the gist of it
11:05 - I've tried ah so let's just like show
11:07 - something sort of nice that we can do
11:08 - here which is that if I were to run this
11:11 - at 1920 by 1080 like super high
11:15 - resolution um and I'm going to uh I'm
11:18 - just going to put print line uh frame
11:20 - rate in here so I'm going to run this
11:22 - you can see that processing is not able
11:25 - to render the game of life it's might be
11:27 - hard for you to see this in this sort of
11:28 - like captured video tutorial but it's
11:31 - not able to run this super fast at such
11:33 - high resolution and um it's actually
11:36 - quite fast you can see the frame rate is
11:38 - about 14 frames per second but I want to
11:40 - make this glorious game of life
11:42 - simulation that runs at 30 frames per
11:44 - second so now if I do this and I hit
11:47 - record you can see by the way it's
11:48 - slowing down also while recording
11:50 - because there is there's some energy and
11:53 - computation and time that it takes to
11:55 - render these to a file if I run this now
11:58 - run this to uh render this to a file and
12:01 - I stop recording and I skip out of the
12:04 - program and I go back to tools Movie
12:07 - Maker and I
12:10 - uh uh whoops go up here and I get this
12:13 - output folder and I drag it into here
12:16 - it's the same folder uh now this needs
12:18 - to be 1920 by 1080 and of course I could
12:22 - just select this same size as Originals
12:23 - frame ratees create movie and I want to
12:26 - do Test movie n 1080 and hit save and
12:31 - you can see now you're seeing the little
12:32 - progress window it's just not doing it
12:34 - as fast this time it's creating the
12:37 - movie and then uh it's finished and I'm
12:42 - going to go to the
12:43 - desktop uh to look at what I've
12:46 - rendered and Test movie 1080 I'm going
12:49 - to open this
12:50 - up converting um so that quick time can
12:54 - render
12:55 - it come on quick time
13:00 - okay there we go I'm going make this
13:01 - full screen I'm going to play it you can
13:03 - see I've got my 30 frames per second
13:05 - game of life simulation all programmed
13:07 - in processing so oh I don't know what
13:09 - just happened oh you know what I left
13:11 - some old files in there so it like
13:13 - rendered at the end that so it stitched
13:15 - two together it stitched like the high
13:17 - resolution one with the low resolution
13:19 - one together that's kind of interesting
13:20 - so anyway you can see um all sorts of
13:23 - possibilities I hope that this helps you
13:25 - um with things that you might be making
13:27 - in processing you can do this with 3D
13:29 - uh you can do this with just about
13:31 - anything um and let me know how it goes
13:33 - for you um so thanks for watching this
13:35 - video and I will be back soon with more
13:37 - videos

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome in this video I'm going to show you how to take a processing sketch and render it to a movie so this comes up a lot and there's probably a variety of ways that you could do this but I'm going to show you a particular technique that hopefully will be useful to you so I you know I picked this arbitrarily it's one of the examples from my nature of code materials um it is a a simulation called The Game of Life a cellular automata system automata boy I'm never going to get that right ever in my life um and it's just it's a a an AR animation but anything anything at all that you draw to the screen in processing you can render as a video out of processing why would you want to do this well there's a variety of reasons one is uh you might want to upload something to Vimeo or YouTube or some other um website to host a video uh you might want to bring this into another project maybe you're working on an animation in in something like after effects and you want to have some elements that you've programmed in there I can think of some I'll try to include some examples of people who have done this kind of work in the a YouTube description below so you might want to take what you're doing incorporate into another project in video form another thing might be actually that you just the thing that you made is beautiful but it runs incredibly slow and you want to you don't need it to run in real time so you could render it as a video so that it could run at 30 frames per second and play back as at a as an installation or whatever it is you might be doing so let's look at how you might do that and there's there's there's a bunch of steps to it um um and I'll try to go through them so the first thing that I will show oh and you know what this font is remarkably small so let me just show you in processing 3 I can go to the preferences I'm going to change the editor font to 36 and I think that's going to be a little bit better hopefully you can see that um okay so what's the first thing that I want to do to this so what I'm going to do is save so there's uh there there may be some other uh processing libraries you you can get to render directly to a movie file but what I'm going to show you how to do instead of rendering directly to a movie file you can always just save what's on the screen as an image so for example if I put save um the function save and I say um go.png right I'm just going to put that in draw and I'm going to run it you can see first of all I don't know if you can tell if it's running slower or not maybe it is maybe it's not I'm going to close this and I'm going to go to that sketch folder and you can see right there there now is a file called go.png and you can see it's a snapshot of what was on the screen now I was doing that in draw so it was doing it over and over and over again and what we're seeing now is just the last frame that it drew so the save function is way and you might put that in Mouse press or attach it you know you might at some point just want to use Save just to save a snapshot of what's on the screen but if you use the save frame function what the save frame function allows you to do is include the pounds symbol the hash symbol and what it will do now is autonumber the files so every time you call Save frame it's going to save goore one goore 2 so this now if I'm executing this in draw every time through draw I'm going to get a new image file and I'm going to run this and I'm going to try not to run it for very long oops did I leave it running because now I'm going to go in and be like oh my goodness and you can see there here it is I have a image file for every single uh thing that was saved uh every single frame now I don't like this this is kind of a disaster because I have a zillion files and it's polluting my file system here so I'm going to delete these and I'm going to show you what I think would be more useful to do I'm going to make just a directory I'm going to call it output SLG pound pound pound Pound and I'm going to run this and I'm going to let it run okay that was enough time and and uh now you can see I have this all here and I can just cycle through it and you can see there it is every single frame and by the way I'm using the PNG file format which will save uncompressed so this way the full quality is there in each and every frame this way later on you could choose to compress it or different codec whatever you want to do with your video that's a bit outside the scope so now the question is what do you do with these files so you could bring them into Final Cut Pro or iMovie or EG Studio 159 zy Pluto magic thing rainbow I don't know is there rainbow in there whatever it is you can find your own software lots of software can take an image sequence After Effects will do this for you and render to a movie it so happens that if you want the sort of quick way of doing it processing up here under the tools menu under Tools there is a Movie Maker tool so if I go to click here Movie Maker and select it it opens up an interface that says this tool and you I don't know if you can read that this tool creates a QuickTime movie from a sequence of images blah blah blah it gives you a bunch of information all sorts of thing you can do what I'm going to do now is I'm going to go to the finder I'm going to find this output folder and I'm going to drag this output folder right here and then I'm going to look here and say like okay um my uh it's it's it's giving me a default height of 640 by 480 but I want to change that because my processing window it's self was 640x 360 what's the frame rate that I want oh and I guess I could have clicked same size as Originals in which case it would just use the size of the the file um and then I can pick whether I want to have some sort of compression I'm going to pick animation which basically means no compression so I'm going to get a very big file but I'll be able to bring it into some other software again if I'm using this in After Effects it's going to need to be recompressed later so I don't want to compress multiple times so I could also bring in a sound file if I wanted to include some sound with it I'm not going to worry about that and I'm going to hit uh create movie and it wants me to save it somewhere I'm going to uh put it on the desktop as testm movie. moove and hit save and did that already happen did it just like do it so fast normally it shows a little progress window but maybe I just had so little a test movie. move I'm going to open this up uh come on quick time and yeah oh so it just happened so fast you can see it there it is so now I have a movie file that I can save uh wow amazingly if it was longer you would have probably seen a little progress bar for it rendering it and you can see this is just a QuickTime movie that I'm playing fantastic so that's the basic gist of it uh in six minutes I kind of showed you the main piece but I think we could do a little bit more here because you might be in a situation where you want to start and stop the rendering to a file um you might want to uh be able to see some information on the screen whether it's rendering or not so I'm just going to add a couple more um pieces to this program just to make it a little bit more sophisticated okay so so one thing I'm going to do is I'm going to create a Boolean variable called recording and I'm going to assume that we're not recording When the program first starts so Boolean recording equals false so and then I'm going to say if recording this is where I should save those frames so the other thing I want to do by the way now that I finished and made that movie maybe you need backups and stuff but I'm just going to go and delete that folder because I don't want to save the previous uh I don't need to save those previous raw files I have everything that I need right here in quick time now and I will just save that um the the the movie file again um so now only if only if the Boolean variable recording is set to True will it actually save those frames that's a useful thing now what I'm going to do is say let's say what I want to do is uh have a way okay so if I say you know this isn't that interesting let's use key pressed so uh if I could say if key equals r or key equals capital r recording equals not recording so what this is going to do is when oh I I'm in JavaScript land I wrote function void um what this is going to do is it's going to say anytime I press r on the keyboard it will start recording or stop recording it's going to toggle the Boolean state of recording if Rec not true is false not false is true so recording equals not itself if it's false become true if it's true become false so that's going to happen there anytime I toggle it and you can see like if I run this program and I go to the files we can see that it's not record recording if I hit if I click in here and I hit R you can see suddenly new files are appearing if I hit R again those new files will have stopped so simply by adding a quick little something to the program I can kind of turn on and off the recording now also what would be nice here is for me to be able to see some visual indication on the screen as to whether it's recording or not so what if I just WR here I say okay um Phil uh red otherwise fill green and draw a circle I don't know at the middle of the screen towards the bottom that's like a circle so if we run this you can see there's a little green this is like terrible visual design but there's a little green circle there when it's not recording and when I hit record that Circle turns red when I hit record again that Circle turns green I don't know if those are the right colors the visual indicators you want but you get the idea I can toggle the color of that Circle and know whether I'm recording or not very useful but but are you thinking in your mind oh no there's a big problem I don't want a big ugly green or red circle in my video but one thing that's wonderful about the save frame function is it's going to save the current view of the processing window and guess what the circle is drawn after I call Save frame so save frame is going to save what's in the window window and then draw the circle on top of that that Circle won't get saved to the file so we should be able to see if I go back to um here and delete that I'm going to run this and I want to start recording for a little bit it's recording it's recording it's recording recording I want to stop recording and then I'm going to close here I'm going to go and look let's just look at these files no green or red circle so we've done it we're we're able to add a little visual indicator into to our window as to whether it's recording or not um I think that's the gist of it I've tried ah so let's just like show something sort of nice that we can do here which is that if I were to run this at 1920 by 1080 like super high resolution um and I'm going to uh I'm just going to put print line uh frame rate in here so I'm going to run this you can see that processing is not able to render the game of life it's might be hard for you to see this in this sort of like captured video tutorial but it's not able to run this super fast at such high resolution and um it's actually quite fast you can see the frame rate is about 14 frames per second but I want to make this glorious game of life simulation that runs at 30 frames per second so now if I do this and I hit record you can see by the way it's slowing down also while recording because there is there's some energy and computation and time that it takes to render these to a file if I run this now run this to uh render this to a file and I stop recording and I skip out of the program and I go back to tools Movie Maker and I uh uh whoops go up here and I get this output folder and I drag it into here it's the same folder uh now this needs to be 1920 by 1080 and of course I could just select this same size as Originals frame ratees create movie and I want to do Test movie n 1080 and hit save and you can see now you're seeing the little progress window it's just not doing it as fast this time it's creating the movie and then uh it's finished and I'm going to go to the desktop uh to look at what I've rendered and Test movie 1080 I'm going to open this up converting um so that quick time can render it come on quick time okay there we go I'm going make this full screen I'm going to play it you can see I've got my 30 frames per second game of life simulation all programmed in processing so oh I don't know what just happened oh you know what I left some old files in there so it like rendered at the end that so it stitched two together it stitched like the high resolution one with the low resolution one together that's kind of interesting so anyway you can see um all sorts of possibilities I hope that this helps you um with things that you might be making in processing you can do this with 3D uh you can do this with just about anything um and let me know how it goes for you um so thanks for watching this video and I will be back soon with more videos
