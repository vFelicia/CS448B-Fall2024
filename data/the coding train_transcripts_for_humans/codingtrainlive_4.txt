04:39 - good afternoon everyone uh check one two
04:42 - i am
04:42 - just testing my mic let me know if you
04:45 - can hear me okay i do have the music
04:47 - volume up a little higher than i usually
04:49 - do
04:50 - so you can confirm for me whether it's a
04:52 - little too loud
04:54 - and i'll be starting in approximately
04:55 - one minute
05:22 - do
05:31 - [Music]
05:36 - so
05:39 - [Music]
05:50 - do
05:52 - [Music]
06:31 - hello happy saturday it's the coding
06:33 - trade again
06:34 - here we are every saturday even when i
06:36 - said i don't know when this was
06:39 - was it it was definitely at the start of
06:41 - january i think if not earlier
06:44 - if i would no longer be live streaming
06:45 - on the weekends because the weekends is
06:48 - not a convenient time for me to live
06:49 - stream and yet here we are again
06:51 - another saturday afternoon i am live
06:52 - streaming it turns out
06:54 - it's not exactly a convenient time but
06:56 - it is more convenient
06:58 - than the other times during the week
06:59 - that i thought might work out someday
07:01 - this will all change
07:03 - but for now i am here on saturdays
07:05 - actually just to get this out of the way
07:06 - the schedule is going to be quite
07:07 - light for the next couple months in
07:10 - terms of live streams there's a lot of
07:12 - new content coming out on the channel so
07:14 - you will get your fill of coding train
07:16 - without a doubt if you're interested in
07:18 - that but in terms of the live streams
07:20 - just to let you know
07:21 - um i will be live streaming next weekend
07:23 - most likely but that's like 50 50.
07:27 - then i will 100 definitely be live
07:29 - streaming put this in your calendar on
07:31 - march
07:31 - 19th that's not 100 actually let's put
07:34 - that at like 90 to 95 percent i have a
07:36 - guest coming and i will soon
07:38 - put that as an event on the youtube
07:41 - calendar of events because a youtube
07:43 - calendar event no
07:44 - but i will make it a scheduled live
07:47 - stream on the channel so it will appear
07:48 - on
07:49 - the youtube coding train home page on
07:51 - youtube and then
07:52 - i am going to be out of town not
07:55 - actually not really out of town i'm
07:56 - still going to be in new york but i will
07:58 - not be
07:59 - in brooklyn for a few weeks so
08:02 - there won't be unless something changes
08:04 - and i find some miraculous way with a
08:06 - good internet connection to live stream
08:07 - during that time
08:08 - i will there will be no streams between
08:11 - approximately
08:12 - march 20th and april 10th
08:15 - um so uh so there will be a bit of a
08:18 - lull there but
08:18 - lots of new content and uh you probably
08:21 - are aware i want to say hi to
08:22 - folks in the chat and see what's going
08:25 - on here
08:26 - but you're probably aware the focus
08:27 - right now of the coding train
08:29 - is most definitely on um
08:32 - nature of co tutorial so if you've just
08:35 - if you
08:36 - haven't been around in a while you're
08:38 - tuning in maybe for the first time
08:40 - ever or after a while and you haven't
08:42 - been following what's been going on the
08:43 - channel
08:43 - if you go to the codingtrain.com
08:46 - learning
08:47 - nature of code and uh you'll see this
08:49 - playlist of videos
08:51 - all of which were completed uh
08:54 - a year ago in the spring of 2020 then i
08:57 - had i don't know if you know a family
08:58 - know about what happened in the year
09:00 - 2020
09:00 - a lot let me just say uh kind of lost
09:04 - steam with this project but i have
09:05 - firmly returned to it here
09:07 - in 2021 and all of the chapter
09:11 - 3 videos have been completed and
09:14 - published
09:15 - and guess what all of the chapter 4
09:18 - videos which is only four videos
09:20 - four videos for chapter four four being
09:22 - the only number in the english language
09:25 - that has the length is the number of
09:29 - letters in the word of the number itself
09:31 - did you know that interesting facts
09:32 - by the way i kind of want to just
09:33 - completely change the coding train to
09:35 - a channel called facts about numbers
09:38 - i i've been sending these emails to my
09:41 - nyu course and i try to include a little
09:43 - like tidbit about like a number in them
09:46 - and then i realized like oh i love this
09:48 - so much maybe i should go through
09:50 - my random number book and just uh uh
09:53 - just completely pivot the content is
09:55 - just me
09:56 - it's asmr facts about numbers uh reading
09:59 - on the coding train
10:00 - anyway i was saying chapter four uh
10:03 - particle systems four new videos they've
10:04 - all been recorded
10:06 - it may take a little while for them to
10:07 - be publicly available on the channel
10:09 - this is my
10:10 - small little plug that if you would like
10:12 - a sort of sneak preview of those
10:13 - as they're in process so rough drafts
10:16 - and early versions i will
10:18 - share with members of the coding train
10:20 - in the coding train discord now the
10:22 - coding terrain discord which i will
10:24 - press this button
10:25 - is uh hopefully it just appeared in the
10:27 - chat
10:30 - it's available to everyone i encourage
10:31 - you to join we have a lot of new
10:33 - moderators shout out and thank you to
10:35 - the new moderators
10:37 - um it's a place where hopefully it's
10:39 - welcoming and
10:40 - friendly a family-friendly place where
10:42 - you can get um help with your code
10:44 - there's a lot of different help channels
10:45 - i could show you these things right now
10:47 - but i'm just going to talk
10:49 - um certainly if you're running into any
10:52 - issues on the discord and you have ideas
10:54 - for things that you think we could do to
10:55 - improve
10:56 - it and by improve it i mean improve the
10:58 - sort of community vibe
11:00 - the inclusive nature what i hope and
11:02 - want for that discord
11:03 - um please definitely like reach out to
11:05 - the moderation team
11:07 - um um
11:10 - yeah so um pratyush roy in the chat is
11:13 - asking
11:14 - um that you're not on discord because
11:16 - you are under 13.
11:18 - when you turn 13 please join absolutely
11:21 - so i believe that the discord
11:23 - this is uh you know out of my hands so
11:25 - to speak um although
11:27 - well um but the the um terms of service
11:30 - or discord are
11:31 - um you have to be 13 or older okay
11:34 - um what am i looking at the chat so
11:36 - what's the deal with these live streams
11:38 - if these are
11:40 - sequence tutorial videos that appear on
11:43 - the coding train
11:44 - why am i here i don't know actually
11:48 - i've kind of lost track of what the
11:50 - whole
11:51 - thing with the coding train is why i'm
11:53 - here oh the uh i was plugged
11:56 - i don't know you tell me why am i here
11:59 - well i would like to engage and connect
12:01 - with the community to some small extent
12:03 - by the way
12:04 - i have a little bit of a problem i've
12:06 - been kind of obsessively
12:08 - on clubhouse which is an audio only on
12:11 - social network
12:12 - i think it's only ios only which is kind
12:14 - of ridiculous but i assume that's just
12:15 - because i haven't had the time to
12:15 - develop it for other platforms yet
12:17 - but i own clubhouse
12:20 - about a half an hour ago now it's at 12
12:23 - 40 p.m eastern
12:24 - i started a room that said pre-coding
12:27 - train live stream chat
12:28 - because i was up here like plugging in
12:29 - things i thought anybody wants to come
12:31 - in ask a question offer a suggestion
12:32 - for the coding trains live stream maybe
12:35 - they'll uh pop in on clubhouse and say
12:37 - hello nobody joined not one person
12:39 - joined
12:40 - it sat there empty with just me for like
12:42 - five to ten minutes
12:43 - and then i very very sheepishly
12:47 - coward and clicked the leave quietly
12:49 - button i left
12:50 - my own room that i had started and sat
12:53 - in by myself for five
12:54 - minutes ten minutes quietly so anyway if
12:56 - um um
12:59 - um and kobe is um is uh offering some
13:02 - information in the chat about how to
13:04 - join um if you um once you reached a
13:06 - certain birthday okay
13:08 - so um
13:12 - i forgot the other thing so so what do i
13:15 - want to
13:16 - um oh and simon is pointing out that it
13:19 - is
13:20 - invite only ios only audio only yeah so
13:24 - you do need an invite
13:25 - you know if you want an invite i got a
13:27 - lot of invites such a clubhouse invite
13:30 - okay actually if you get a clubhouse
13:32 - invite from me it permanently
13:34 - says forever nominated by
13:37 - daniel schiffman so
13:41 - um that's probably why no enjoy i have
13:44 - invites
13:45 - okay okay okay uh anyway i thought
13:49 - you know i try to do i would like to do
13:50 - some more sort of like q a style stuff
13:52 - obviously i could do that on youtube
13:54 - itself
13:55 - um i could also we have a whole discord
14:00 - which has
14:00 - probably all the capabilities if not
14:02 - more of what clubhouse has but
14:04 - i the reason why i kind of got a little
14:06 - bit addicted to it is
14:08 - um there's a couple podcasts that i
14:09 - listened to that i'm a fan of and they
14:11 - were just having discussion rooms and i
14:13 - was joining them and
14:14 - like really excited and then there were
14:16 - some a lot of you know
14:17 - it's sort of like nft and crypto
14:19 - discussion all the time and i know
14:20 - nothing about that
14:21 - i mean part of me in a very very sort of
14:23 - like
14:24 - crude and uh selfish way sees the nft
14:28 - stuff and just starts to think oh
14:30 - could i sell like you know little like
14:32 - clips of coding train videos as
14:33 - nfts and then i'm like what is wrong
14:37 - with me and my like
14:38 - capitalist urges but um it's sort of
14:40 - interesting to follow at least what's
14:42 - happening in the art world and
14:44 - collecting our digital art in particular
14:46 - and nfcs and i know
14:47 - nothing about it so if you um
14:51 - if you know stuff about that want to
14:52 - come into the tony train discord and
14:54 - educate me i would love to hear
14:56 - all right so as now i think i've
14:58 - answered my own question why am i live
15:00 - streaming
15:01 - just to be here ramble talk engage with
15:04 - the community
15:04 - and work on tutorial adjacent
15:09 - projects um hopefully work on like
15:11 - nonsensical
15:12 - useless projects i actually let me just
15:14 - mention something speaking of clubhouse
15:16 - i wasn't gonna do this
15:18 - but now it's all connected let me go to
15:20 - um i should put this in a github repo
15:22 - so one of the podcasts that i listen to
15:25 - is called
15:26 - um i know you don't know
15:31 - i-d-y-d-k and to be honest i don't
15:33 - listen to every episode
15:34 - because it's about a television show
15:36 - called psych and i haven't watched the
15:38 - show yet
15:39 - and i keep thinking i'll watch it
15:40 - eventually and then listen to the
15:41 - episodes
15:42 - but i um uh the hosts were i have a sort
15:45 - of fun game that they play i guess in
15:47 - the tv show
15:47 - psych let me see if i can find this um
15:52 - you can start to see where i'm going
15:54 - with this um the tv show psych i believe
15:56 - there is a hidden pineapple in every
15:58 - episode
16:00 - and um they have a discussion
16:04 - on the show about uh on the on
16:08 - the podcast about where is the pineapple
16:10 - how pineapply-ish
16:12 - is that particular image
16:15 - so i built a system using you know my
16:18 - knowledge
16:19 - i'm trying to use my knowledge of coding
16:21 - and algorithms of machine learning
16:23 - to make a difference in the world people
16:24 - and i thought what else could i possibly
16:27 - do to make a difference
16:28 - than make a pineapple detection web page
16:32 - system
16:33 - for a uh probably a podcast hopefully
16:35 - they're gonna have like a huge they're
16:37 - gonna get the coding train bump now and
16:38 - have thousands of listeners
16:40 - but they're a new podcast i'm assuming
16:41 - it's a small niche
16:43 - group you know i'm a niche this is a
16:45 - niche youtube channel i have all these
16:46 - subscribers but no one really watches
16:48 - the videos
16:50 - it's very interesting to me i mean lots
16:52 - of people do watch the videos don't get
16:53 - me wrong but just
16:54 - um um
16:57 - but uh i forgot what i was talking about
17:00 - anyway so i worked on this i'm gonna
17:01 - show it to you because maybe i can turn
17:02 - this into a github repo and take
17:04 - contributions for it i'll just go to
17:06 - this one
17:06 - which i think is the webcam version of
17:08 - it um you can see that i um
17:11 - did a lot of work with my web my web
17:13 - design skills
17:15 - to build this amazing website um
17:18 - uh are there psych fans i i hear by the
17:20 - way if you're a psych fan
17:22 - you're called a psycho right that's like
17:25 - you know like if you're a fan
17:26 - of is there a name for a coding train
17:29 - fan by the way like i guess you're a
17:32 - passenger no that's that's not i don't
17:33 - know you're a you're a choo choo ian
17:36 - oh and tarantu has just joined
17:41 - tarantu welcome to
17:44 - being you could be the one terence
17:47 - right now you could decide what is
17:51 - the name that fans of the coding train
17:54 - call themselves
17:56 - but i've got to reveal that i'm wearing
17:59 - sweatpants
18:02 - to get my random number book because um
18:05 - i most distinctly by the way i'm
18:06 - quite quite pineapple-ish if i don't say
18:09 - so myself
18:10 - uh terence your random number please
18:12 - write this down there's absolutely no
18:13 - other way we could ever possibly
18:15 - remember this
18:15 - ever like no computers or databases or
18:20 - anything near us that could possibly
18:21 - keep track of of random numbers assigned
18:23 - to viewers but your random number is
18:26 - on page 209 which is probably the page
18:28 - that i give everybody's random number
18:29 - which is what it opens to
18:31 - um and austin is saying it looks like a
18:34 - late 90s page yes
18:35 - that's the vibe i was going for um
18:40 - uh your random number on page 209
18:43 - uh line 10 445
18:46 - 35 086 that is your
18:50 - random number so um what i did with this
18:53 - a particular
18:55 - this is a teachable machine trained
18:56 - model a pineapple is actually
18:58 - one of the categories in mobilenet
19:01 - there's 1 000 labels in the mobilenet
19:03 - machine learning
19:04 - image classification model that i use in
19:06 - a lot of coding tutorials and examples
19:08 - but using mobilenet on its own it wasn't
19:10 - really picking up
19:11 - pineapples unless they were you know
19:13 - prominently obviously a pineapple like
19:15 - right in front of the camera so i kind
19:17 - of trained my own model using
19:19 - uh images from um of pineapples as well
19:22 - as
19:23 - screenshots from the television show
19:25 - psych with pineapples placed in them
19:28 - like overlaid i wrote a processing
19:30 - sketch that loads
19:32 - snapshots of psychedel puts pineapples
19:36 - in them
19:36 - made date about i should just be doing
19:38 - this during my livestream it's such a
19:39 - fun project
19:40 - little did you know this is what i'm
19:41 - spending my evenings doing
19:43 - um and uh then took screenshots from the
19:47 - show that didn't have pineapples in them
19:49 - trained a model and now
19:50 - um we can see i know this was one of the
19:52 - things i was using to test
19:54 - fans karn is suggesting that fans of the
19:57 - coding train
19:58 - are unicorns or rainbows that could work
20:02 - um people in the chat i are saying
20:04 - please say my name and i really
20:06 - appreciate your enthusiasm and desire
20:08 - and i don't mind just like
20:09 - every once in a while reading one of
20:11 - them or maybe i shouldn't even say that
20:12 - but i would like to discourage people
20:13 - from asking that a chat sort of fills up
20:15 - the chat with a lot of extraneous
20:17 - messages and i will pull out
20:19 - and reference so you're more likely to
20:21 - have me say your name
20:22 - if i if you post a uh a wonderful little
20:26 - quip
20:26 - or suggestion or chat message there so
20:29 - let's try i know that it really like
20:31 - basically learned
20:32 - that yellow the pineapples are yellow
20:34 - you can see that i've made a
20:36 - yellow detector um i wonder if i just
20:39 - like take my hat off
20:41 - um how you know i've got a
20:44 - mushroom here oh come on
20:48 - can you hear that
20:51 - this is my new sound effect um yeah so
20:53 - anyway um
20:55 - i don't know that i should um do this
20:58 - right now maybe one of the
20:59 - um coding trade mods or
21:03 - github managers people i'm like making
21:05 - up titles for people
21:07 - but if you have access to make a new
21:09 - coding train repo
21:10 - i'll put this sketch into and actually
21:12 - the one
21:14 - the one that i probably should start
21:16 - with is not the webcam one
21:17 - this is meant to be used although
21:18 - there's no reason why i couldn't have it
21:20 - do both
21:21 - um pineapple
21:27 - uh pineapple detection system this is it
21:31 - yeah this is the one where you can drag
21:32 - and drop an image
21:34 - so if i were to look for an image
21:38 - let's actually look for a screenshot
21:40 - from psych
21:42 - um
21:46 - like uh let's use this
21:49 - this is this is this is definitely that
21:52 - um
21:52 - i'm using my time my live stream very
21:55 - wisely here
21:56 - we're gonna get to all sorts of
21:58 - productive important projects
22:00 - let's just uh let's let's confirm
22:04 - which i put on the desktop yeah let's
22:06 - drag this image in
22:07 - and we've got yes see no pineapple in
22:10 - that image
22:12 - now if i were to take that image
22:17 - and i were to then
22:22 - oh that's such a small little image and
22:24 - then i were to look for a pineapple
22:30 - and like
22:34 - paste it in and make it small
22:39 - like he's got pineapples on his shirt
22:42 - now okay
22:43 - i'm saving this let's see how this
22:46 - changes it
22:48 - let's see if my model works the way i
22:50 - expect
22:51 - point two two percent pineapple there we
22:53 - go 62
22:54 - pineapple
22:59 - this is how i've been spending my time
23:01 - the thing is though i think
23:03 - i don't know how this is where i ended
23:04 - up in my life but i do get paid
23:06 - to teach actual college courses on this
23:09 - stuff and i i was working on this for
23:11 - the most part
23:12 - as a way to um
23:15 - um then i hope that this will be an
23:18 - example for my course in the fall
23:20 - it'll be fun you know the students will
23:22 - enjoy it they'll think i'm their
23:23 - really cool professor teacher person
23:27 - thing all right
23:31 - enough about pineapple ai please uh
23:34 - you just go to twitter twitter uh
23:37 - hashtag
23:38 - pioneer oh it's i forgot to say it's not
23:40 - pineapple ai it's
23:41 - um like if i go to twitter and go to uh
23:44 - hashtag
23:46 - uh pine a i pull its name is pineapple
23:51 - and i really actually just want to make
23:52 - a twitter bot
23:53 - that you can oh there we go good work
23:55 - everybody let's just show your
24:00 - please hold
24:06 - [Music]
24:22 - all right
24:24 - [Music]
24:28 - i broke my own rule which is not to be
24:30 - logged into my actual twitter account
24:32 - on a live stream but that's okay
24:33 - everything's okay
24:35 - uh you know it's just another day where
24:38 - nazi is trending on twitter thank you
24:40 - very much
24:42 - never opening up that trash website
24:45 - again
24:46 - oh my god all right back
24:50 - to back to today so let me actually try
24:53 - to
24:53 - um get um
24:57 - a little bit of a coding rail
25:01 - fan a rail fan is a fan of a train says
25:05 - arnov
25:06 - and profimesh is pointing out that my um
25:09 - green screen is 99 playable oh and david
25:12 - is a big fan of psych so david please oh
25:15 - yeah you can participate in this with me
25:16 - excellent
25:17 - uh the worlds can collide the
25:20 - uh weird entertainment podcasting world
25:22 - that i like to just listen in on from
25:24 - time to time
25:25 - um i have a whole other ai project that
25:28 - actually has quite uh
25:29 - not a large audience but a slightly
25:31 - larger audience than the pineapple ai
25:33 - that i'll bring to the coding train
25:34 - someday is there anybody here still
25:36 - watching
25:37 - no good we're we're uh this is a uh oh
25:40 - my goodness and guess who forgot
25:42 - to uh say thank you uh today's sponsor
25:45 - um brilliant uh brilliant is a wonderful
25:49 - a website where if you would like to
25:51 - learn
25:52 - in an interactive way everything you
25:55 - need to make a pineapple ai
25:57 - you actually could because they have a
25:58 - whole set of interactive courses
26:01 - that are step-by-step um quizzes
26:04 - and learning modules um that you can
26:06 - learn a whole variety of topics
26:08 - almost all of which are connected to
26:09 - things that they do here on the coding
26:11 - drain math and science and physics and
26:13 - coding and geometry and ai
26:15 - you can go to brilliant.org codingtrain
26:17 - you can actually sign up for free just
26:18 - signing up for free from that link
26:20 - shows them that you found it from me but
26:22 - if you want to unlock
26:23 - everything all the courses and
26:24 - everything at brilliant uh the first 200
26:26 - subscribers will get 20
26:27 - off so i'll come and i'm going to look
26:28 - at a course that i'm doing right now
26:30 - the course that i'm going through is one
26:31 - of the geometry ones and i'll come back
26:33 - and look at that a little bit more later
26:36 - um all right
26:40 - all right so one the one the first thing
26:42 - on my list today
26:43 - and this can be this is which is really
26:45 - important and maybe what i will do is
26:47 - just go to my rainbow topics
26:50 - um
26:52 - is that i have uh traditionally
26:56 - for however many years now maybe two or
26:58 - three
26:59 - um made a video a coding challenge for
27:04 - pi day
27:05 - and some of these maybe i've already
27:08 - done
27:09 - some of them maybe i didn't but i sort
27:10 - of i've kind of exhausted a lot of the
27:12 - things that i know about that kind of
27:13 - maybe would make sense for pi day
27:16 - um and it's also it comes at a bad time
27:19 - for me
27:20 - because ultimately you know if we're
27:22 - like pi day were in june although i
27:24 - guess i could do tau day
27:25 - and then i wasn't teaching and i had
27:27 - more time to like work on
27:29 - sort of speculative other topic videos
27:32 - but i don't want to let it go without a
27:33 - video this year
27:34 - and it there could be something actually
27:36 - quite relevant to
27:38 - um that comes out of like some of these
27:40 - recent videos that i've been doing about
27:42 - polar coordinates and simple harmonic
27:44 - motion and all that stuff
27:46 - but here i am it is just time
27:50 - for me to um
27:55 - and pratyush is saying that pineapple is
27:57 - my favorite fruit i actually don't
27:58 - really like refined up all that much
28:00 - let's see if anybody can guess my
28:01 - favorite fruit i'm not sure i really
28:02 - know what my favorite fruit is
28:04 - but if if we go back to the fruit that i
28:07 - used to always eat as a child
28:09 - there's a there's a famous story in my
28:10 - family
28:12 - i famously refused to eat at fast food
28:14 - restaurants was a child
28:16 - and uh um ate a bag of plums
28:20 - oh i just gave it away but i hate a bag
28:23 - of plums
28:24 - instead of the like and my family did
28:26 - not go to fast food restaurants very
28:28 - often but it was like on some sort of
28:29 - trip or something and everybody got
28:30 - horrible food poisoning and sick but not
28:32 - me because i only ate the plums
28:35 - um mango is a good one and also love the
28:38 - blueberry oh
28:39 - the blueberry is a wonderful fruit but
28:42 - yeah
28:42 - now you've all guessed plums because i
28:44 - already said although i don't know maybe
28:45 - um oh and austin tal day austin i
28:47 - haven't seen you
28:48 - in a while uh welcome back austin
28:51 - or maybe you've been around all this
28:52 - time and i just haven't noticed your
28:53 - name recently all right
28:56 - um
28:58 - so i need some ideas for pi day so this
29:00 - is a i don't i don't know how well this
29:01 - is going to work but
29:02 - um put them in the chat i'm going to um
29:05 - let's look for things that i've done
29:06 - already pi day coding train
29:10 - if i do this um so i did
29:14 - oh i did a version of a video based on
29:18 - three blue one browns
29:20 - um three blue one browns
29:25 - um video about the clacking
29:28 - what else to call it right now sorry i'm
29:29 - seeing a chat mask how about calculating
29:31 - pi the archimedean way one polygon
29:33 - touching a circle from
29:34 - inside another from the outside and the
29:36 - average length approaches the real
29:38 - circumference as they get more edges
29:40 - interesting i like this idea i did the
29:42 - first pi day challenge that i did was
29:44 - this one
29:45 - which is approximating
29:48 - um the value of pi with the dart
29:51 - throwing method what is the
29:53 - i'm not gonna be able to say this and i
29:54 - i do know this is just like not
29:56 - i mean i'm i'm familiar with this
30:00 - um it's just not fresh in my memory and
30:02 - i'm sure i spelled it archimedes way
30:04 - um finding pi by archimedes method
30:07 - official website approximating pi
30:09 - all right let's look at this you know
30:12 - what
30:14 - guess what everybody 13w net new york is
30:17 - my local station
30:19 - thank you very much not that i have any
30:22 - way of watching it
30:23 - but it is my local station okay around
30:26 - 250 bc up
30:27 - i have to sneeze okay please hold
30:36 - [Music]
30:58 - [Music]
31:16 - yes i am a very professional
31:20 - youtube host here
31:24 - who just shuts everything off to sneeze
31:26 - i had a box of kleenex the other day
31:28 - right here on the desk i don't know
31:29 - where it is
31:32 - the ratio of a circle's circumference to
31:35 - its diameter well that's the definition
31:37 - of pi
31:40 - um so could i
31:44 - launch an interactive all right let's
31:47 - see what that
31:47 - is
31:57 - ah oh the um
32:01 - uh simon is pointing out the factors in
32:04 - common the chant
32:05 - and that i i know that um it was a long
32:09 - sneeze indeed
32:10 - i know why this interactive is not
32:11 - working so there i know what a channel
32:13 - that i'm a huge
32:14 - a fan of is stand up maths
32:18 - uh pi calculate dice
32:21 - rolling i mean i don't know if this is
32:24 - yep from a thousand random numbers
32:27 - this is what i'm thinking of here hi
32:30 - i'm matt parker and for pi day this year
32:33 - i am going to generate
32:35 - 1 000 random numbers using these two
32:38 - dice the first two of which are 31 and
32:40 - 27 so 31 and 27 do not share
32:44 - a factor in common well they share one
32:47 - the most pointless of all the factors
32:49 - but we're ignoring that right so we say
32:51 - they are
32:52 - this could be good because i need one of
32:54 - the projects that i have on my list
32:55 - today
32:56 - is to digitize and i don't actually have
32:58 - to do this because it already exists
33:00 - but i want to digitize the sequence of
33:02 - random numbers that are in this book
33:04 - so that i can always use it as my random
33:06 - number generator
33:08 - so that i could certainly do and then i
33:10 - would have to write some code
33:12 - that calculates the factors of every
33:14 - number and then determines if they are
33:16 - the same i guess i could like experiment
33:18 - with this right now
33:19 - so one of the things that i can do with
33:21 - my live streams is sort of
33:23 - um tinker around with an idea
33:27 - i got a haircut you can't tell i'm just
33:29 - wearing this hat but all of a sudden
33:30 - like there's like hair all over me
33:32 - um it's probably dog hair from gloria
33:34 - but um
33:36 - what i could do is uh
33:39 - um you know how do i what's an algorithm
33:43 - algorithm
33:47 - for determining the factors of a number
33:53 - uh so like stack overflow will tell us
34:03 - oh and um abe is pointing out that
34:06 - there's a new video that just came out
34:08 - from matt parker
34:09 - which is pi y pi to the pi to the pi
34:13 - to the pi could be an integer
34:17 - huh um
34:21 - it is not random if you get it from a
34:23 - repeatable source yes but there's a
34:25 - million of them
34:27 - i don't i could do i could calculate pi
34:29 - with all one million approximately pi
34:31 - with all
34:32 - one million numbers i love this idea so
34:34 - this is interesting
34:36 - but simon is telling me to check out
34:38 - euclid's
34:40 - algorithm
34:47 - is an efficient method for um
34:51 - computing the greatest common divisor of
34:53 - two integers
34:54 - the largest number that divides them
34:56 - both without a remainder
34:58 - okay this is excellent is an example of
35:00 - an algorithm which is a step-by-step
35:01 - procedure for performing a calculation
35:03 - according to well-defined rules
35:05 - this is one of the oldest okay i'm
35:07 - loving this idea so far
35:08 - so if i were to summarize this
35:12 - what am i not logged in okay hold on
35:18 - what what is going on
35:24 - give me a second here um
35:27 - oh i don't know there's a lot of stuff
35:29 - going on in clubhouse right now i might
35:30 - need to just turn this off and go listen
35:32 - to some interesting discussions
35:36 - um
35:37 - [Music]
35:39 - please hold
35:46 - [Music]
35:55 - oh my god what kind of crazy password is
35:57 - this
35:59 - [Music]
36:05 - [Music]
36:09 - sure why not whatever don't do anything
36:12 - you tell me to do
36:29 - [Music]
36:37 - all right i am back
36:40 - uh in the coding train topics repo
36:43 - and let's make a um
36:48 - by the way i find i find github's dark
36:52 - mode
36:52 - to be a little bit too dark for my taste
36:55 - i don't know why but i feel like i can't
36:56 - read the text
36:58 - um so
37:02 - uh all right yes um now
37:06 - uh pi day 20
37:10 - 21 uh euclids
37:14 - are like
37:20 - cofactors random numbers
37:25 - use all one million
37:28 - random numbers
37:32 - so
37:35 - 500 000 pairs
37:39 - um calculate
37:43 - the um is this what i'm looking for the
37:46 - greatest common divisor
37:50 - [Music]
37:55 - this is good actually this is one of the
37:56 - things i've been helping my
37:58 - kids with in their math class they're
38:00 - learning about how to reduce
38:03 - um fractions to their simplest form
38:06 - um and then so this is a good reference
38:12 - um ah
38:15 - where did i go ah no i closed it i'm the
38:18 - worst okay
38:19 - come on local storage thank you
38:32 - okay and now um this is a very
38:36 - mathy um
38:39 - i'd have to think about what what
38:40 - visuals might go with this
38:42 - but um um what
38:46 - visuals could go with this
38:51 - but and i'm not saying i'm definitely
38:53 - going to do this but
38:55 - here is an idea so if you can actually
38:58 - right now
38:59 - first of all you can reply to this
39:00 - thread if you have some suggestions or
39:02 - comments on this one if i've gotten this
39:04 - sort of wrong
39:05 - but you can right now file any issues
39:08 - here you won't be able to add the pi day
39:10 - label but
39:11 - i or another codingtrain github.org
39:15 - member will be able to do so i'm going
39:18 - to collect um
39:19 - lists of things and probably if pi day
39:22 - is march i need to record this video
39:24 - like next week so get them in get your
39:26 - suggestions in i would say buy
39:29 - monday if you can um
39:34 - all right
39:38 - um
39:41 - let's see anybody else got anything
39:45 - um that you want to share as an idea for
39:48 - pi day before i move on
39:50 - and one of the others like pie art
40:00 - looks like the art in pie
40:05 - yeah i mean i've done videos like this
40:07 - i'm not video
40:08 - i've done examples like this this is
40:09 - really nice
40:11 - i had this idea of graphing the um the
40:14 - distribution of random numbers of
40:16 - numbers in pi
40:17 - to see like if i do the first million
40:19 - like how evenly distributed is it
40:21 - these are lovely um
40:27 - i like seeing these um great work
40:30 - whoever made this visual cinnamon um
40:34 - a pie based rose
40:44 - yeah i mean i've made videos about the
40:46 - lisa's you curve and
40:48 - rose curves and all of these would be
40:50 - great to do i mean i
40:52 - could also do a coding
40:55 - challenge on a topic like this would
40:57 - likely i'd like like i want to do one
40:58 - that i haven't done before
41:00 - that just makes use of um
41:03 - polar coordinates or trigonometry and
41:05 - the number pi
41:06 - in some way that is like a celebration
41:09 - of pi day but not really like dealing
41:11 - with the number pi
41:12 - or its sequence of digits itself that's
41:14 - also something
41:16 - i'm crashing thunder is saying i like
41:18 - the idea of finding
41:19 - sequences or interesting information in
41:21 - the digits
41:22 - but guess what that's what i did last
41:24 - year so uh peaking
41:26 - inside pi coding train i'm pretty sure
41:30 - that was the video
41:32 - um that i did last year um right around
41:34 - the time of the start of the global
41:36 - pandemic
41:37 - uh march 14th 2020 and this was based on
41:41 - i assume it'll be linked from this page
41:44 - um this was based on the fathom
41:48 - uh fathom information designs project
41:50 - peek inside pie so i
41:52 - highly recommend that you check this out
41:54 - by the way i should be doing a better
41:55 - job of this
41:56 - but links that i'm looking at in the
41:58 - live stream
41:59 - i try to post those to the coding train
42:02 - discord
42:03 - under the live category under links so
42:06 - for example
42:07 - here's one that i'm just sharing and
42:11 - here's one that i'm just sharing so if
42:12 - you want to pick up these links
42:14 - um you know this is this youtube video
42:18 - that i just shared
42:19 - um um you can
42:22 - uh grab them there but more importantly
42:26 - boy did i forget to share
42:29 - the link to my pineai apple pineapple
42:36 - what if you use the sequences to make
42:39 - the rows more
42:40 - intricate so i could do a like a
42:42 - follow-up video
42:44 - that elaborates on the the rose curve
42:48 - um and makes some interesting variations
42:50 - of it i'm definitely i'm open to that
42:52 - idea
42:53 - oops i forgot that i don't have this
42:54 - disstream chat
42:58 - oh use the pendulum
43:03 - simulation so simon is saying
43:07 - um oh i don't have this here anyway okay
43:09 - sorry i messed this up
43:10 - bear with me for a second clearing out a
43:13 - chat thing
43:14 - use the pendulum simulation to calculate
43:16 - pi the formula for the period of a
43:18 - pendulum includes pi
43:23 - i think there might be um some issues
43:26 - with that in terms of how what my
43:28 - pendulum simulation actually does
43:30 - what if i could get i have an idea
43:34 - what if i could get a physical pendulum
43:37 - use computer vision to track the
43:40 - pendulums
43:41 - the bob of the pendulum's location
43:45 - and read its period based on
43:48 - millies and its physical location from
43:51 - the
43:52 - camera and then calculate pi that way
43:54 - that's a pretty interesting idea
43:57 - i would even try that right now if i
43:59 - because i have a bunch of cameras and
44:00 - things but i don't think i have a
44:01 - pendulum anywhere i suppose i could rig
44:03 - one up
44:04 - um but i like this idea oh ash
44:08 - okay ash hello hold on a second ash
44:10 - writes i'm learning coding on white hat
44:12 - jr
44:14 - i'm very curious one of the things that
44:15 - um uh i happen to look at from time to
44:18 - time
44:19 - is uh links that peop referral links to
44:22 - like the p5.js website and other
44:24 - kind of creative coding websites that
44:25 - i'm involved with
44:27 - um and
44:31 - um white hat jr is just like a
44:35 - uh uh site that i don't know if it's a
44:38 - massive site but it just throws a lot of
44:40 - traffic to p5.js or editor.pp5 the p5
44:42 - web editor
44:43 - so i'm curious for anyone who's i don't
44:45 - know i'm not familiar with what white
44:46 - house jr
44:47 - is um but i'm curious for anybody who's
44:50 - a user of it to
44:51 - kind of let me know a little bit about
44:52 - it all right
44:55 - and uh simon is telling me that a
44:59 - i don't know why this is not working but
45:00 - i'm not going to worry about it that a
45:02 - 2.45 meter long pendulum
45:05 - will take pi seconds to complete a cycle
45:08 - so maybe i could measure exactly that
45:10 - length
45:12 - why i have like a nervous tic which is
45:14 - when i record videos or live stream
45:17 - i start to like sneeze or my nose gets
45:19 - itchy it's really like it's very strange
45:21 - remember that's a thing that happens to
45:23 - other people or it's just me
45:25 - all right i would like to share uh where
45:28 - we time-wise 1 40 p.m i would like to
45:32 - share some projects from you the
45:35 - community of viewers of the code of
45:36 - dream that you have made that you have
45:38 - put your heart and soul into or
45:39 - at least a little bit of time into you
45:41 - took the time to watch your video
45:43 - play with the code make your own version
45:45 - so submit it to the codygrade website
45:47 - and i want to say thank you to you i
45:50 - love to
45:50 - see these and use them for inspiration
45:52 - and share them with students and all
45:54 - sorts of content so
45:56 - let's move on over to codytraining.com
46:00 - i'm gonna go to the challenger page
46:06 - um and i would like to so i have two
46:10 - methods
46:10 - by which that i look at community
46:12 - contributions one
46:14 - is i spin a wheel to pick a random one i
46:16 - have a just a random number generatory
46:18 - thingy that will pick a random one
46:20 - but i often also like to just look at
46:22 - because there's not that many of them
46:24 - uh community contributions to recent
46:26 - coding challenges so lucky for you
46:28 - if you so feel so inclined if you
46:30 - recently submitted
46:31 - a project to the spring force or
46:35 - the um and thank you for that comment
46:37 - prathamesh that you're sharing with me
46:38 - now that's good for me to know i was not
46:40 - aware
46:41 - the music was quite loud see i knew the
46:43 - music was too loud
46:44 - but i guess it's just different tracks
46:46 - of different volume
46:47 - but let me turn that back down now
46:50 - [Music]
46:53 - sorry everybody too loud too loud too
46:56 - loud
46:57 - yeah sorry about that um
47:01 - okay okay okay i got it i got it why is
47:04 - that why is it that that song is so loud
47:07 - hold on it's gonna be really quiet for a
47:09 - second
47:10 - try this again
47:16 - weird now it's like gone
47:25 - [Music]
47:30 - yeah okay
47:30 - [Music]
47:33 - i just wonder if i can can i do
47:40 - [Music]
47:44 - um q volume
47:47 - 50 percent
47:54 - all right so now
48:02 - so this is at the correct volume and now
48:05 - hopefully please
48:06 - mind your ears i have set that other
48:09 - track to 50
48:10 - volume so it should be fine but there's
48:12 - a small chance
48:13 - i didn't do it correctly it's gonna be
48:14 - too loud here we go
48:20 - hopefully this is good
48:24 - all right sorry about that everybody all
48:26 - right let's look at
48:27 - um let's go to the pendulum first and
48:30 - let's take a look at some of these
48:31 - projects that people have submitted
48:33 - oh yeah this is great i'm so excited so
48:35 - i haven't seen all of these
48:36 - some of these will be new but some of
48:37 - them i have looked at already and i did
48:39 - look at this pendulum on a cart
48:41 - um project so this is super interesting
48:43 - to me
48:44 - because this is a simulation of the sort
48:47 - of pendulum
48:48 - flipped upside down and balanced on a
48:50 - cart
48:51 - and i forget if i can um
48:55 - oh yeah and it's i guess it's an
48:56 - algorithm for the cart to actually like
48:58 - balance itself but this is something
49:00 - that would be
49:02 - roger saying better yet no sound sorry i
49:05 - i have to have the sound it keeps me
49:07 - alive and full of energy it makes me
49:09 - feel like i'm not just alone in an attic
49:11 - in brooklyn new york talking to myself
49:13 - which is in many ways what i'm doing
49:15 - it's a little weird
49:19 - um what i was saying was um i've been
49:22 - looking for some examples for
49:24 - reinforcement style learning and so the
49:27 - sort of like
49:28 - cart balancing a poll type style example
49:31 - um is quite a good one and so maybe
49:34 - there's something i could do with this i
49:35 - have to admit i don't know
49:36 - too much about this particular algorithm
49:38 - it's pid
49:39 - controller um so i don't
49:42 - um like pid cart is a
49:45 - controller i don't know this terminology
49:48 - um
49:50 - but uh proportional integral derivative
49:53 - controller is a control loop mechanism
49:55 - employing feedback ah interesting i
49:57 - would love to explore this
49:59 - in a future video this would be i would
50:01 - love to be able to figure this out
50:03 - myself but
50:04 - not going to happen right now thank you
50:08 - for that wonderful contribution moving
50:11 - on i'm
50:12 - going to go to the colorful pendulum in
50:14 - codepen by andreyud
50:16 - chaka chakraborty
50:20 - there we go i love this we've got some
50:24 - nice
50:24 - um trails going a nice little beautiful
50:27 - red color picked for the pendulum
50:29 - um it'd be interesting to sort of time
50:31 - it and see if we could approximate the
50:33 - number of pi
50:35 - the number pi through this swinging
50:37 - pendulum um one thing that i was going
50:39 - to suggest for people for an exercise i
50:40 - think i might have forgotten to in the
50:41 - video
50:42 - is can you make it so that you can catch
50:43 - the pendulum and drag it around and then
50:45 - let it go
50:46 - um actually the nature of code example
50:48 - does have that code built into it
50:49 - that's something you might consider
50:50 - thank you
50:52 - i don't know why i have to press this
50:53 - thing twice every time
50:55 - why i don't think it's working correctly
51:01 - i was using it to replace this but thank
51:03 - you for this wonderful pendulum
51:04 - simulation okay
51:05 - next simple pendulum simulation using
51:08 - python
51:11 - and we've got a nice youtube video that
51:13 - is
51:14 - showing us the results here uh awesome
51:19 - this looks like that this particular
51:21 - simulation is using some real world
51:24 - measurements to simulate the path
51:27 - the oscillation of a pendulum in python
51:30 - i wonder if there is
51:32 - a code source code is linked here
51:35 - so we can see that here um on
51:38 - um on github itself
51:42 - cool whoa all right awesome um i'm not
51:45 - gonna go through this in a lot of detail
51:46 - right now but it's
51:47 - fun to see okay um
51:50 - next up we have got the up down left
51:54 - right
51:55 - by josh kenzer and this was by karen
51:58 - canary walla by the way the previous one
52:00 - up down left right
52:03 - whoa i have not seen this one yet um
52:07 - so one thing i should probably do this
52:09 - is a little bit unfortunate
52:11 - one thing that the um web editor doesn't
52:13 - do very smartly and i don't know the
52:14 - best way to handle it
52:15 - is if um if the editor is set to high
52:19 - contrast mode
52:21 - but the default sort of like text style
52:24 - is um black so it's very hard to read it
52:26 - let me just do show boxes
52:29 - so that says show boxes and show
52:31 - pendulum which is useful for me to just
52:32 - read out what it says anyway
52:36 - so i guess show pendulums is actually
52:37 - show the lines
52:39 - this is really this is this has the
52:41 - makings of a really nice
52:43 - perfect looping gif um i think there's
52:46 - that that i would really encourage you
52:48 - to think about as a way then you can nft
52:50 - it
52:51 - i don't know is that the thing i don't
52:52 - know how it works
52:54 - um i shouldn't just be so cavalier with
52:57 - my commentary
52:58 - um but uh you know bees and bombs is a
53:02 - um an artist that i'm a huge fan of who
53:04 - makes um
53:05 - among many other artists do this as well
53:07 - but makes uh um
53:09 - looping gifs out of uh simple and
53:12 - sometimes quite complex algorithms like
53:13 - this one but really nice choice of color
53:16 - and behavior in the way the pendulums
53:17 - all synchronize and meet up and create
53:19 - this
53:20 - geometric order and then separate out i
53:22 - love this quite a bit
53:24 - what does the slider do guess it's maybe
53:28 - like the speed
53:30 - or like a force oh or it's like some
53:32 - kind of alpha
53:34 - yeah oh the slider is the alpha yeah
53:38 - interesting that's pretty wild
53:43 - just to zoom in on this for a second
53:47 - that's quite beautiful the smearing of
53:48 - the color
53:51 - all right um
53:54 - bot bit just asked can you do gjk algo
53:58 - and run
53:58 - cutter which i'm probably saying
54:00 - incorrectly sometime i would i do want
54:01 - to explore those someday
54:03 - um i always just use sort of like simple
54:05 - euler integration which is a sort of
54:06 - fancy term for
54:08 - the way that i model motion in like
54:10 - p5.js animation programs and all the
54:12 - nature of code examples but i would like
54:14 - to explore some more
54:15 - sophisticated versions um
54:18 - okay now we've got a pendulum website by
54:21 - sarvogya singh
54:27 - what was that i love this little
54:29 - animation there's a little pendulum
54:30 - there my pendulums
54:31 - a simple pendulum a newton's cradle and
54:34 - a double pendulum oh this is so cool uh
54:38 - use arrow keys to make it move
54:40 - do i click on each of these oh and we
54:41 - get
54:45 - oh so i can like i can like apply a
54:48 - force to it
54:49 - with the arrow key that's pretty cool
54:54 - i love that
54:57 - i love that now let's look at the
54:58 - newton's cradle i would love this would
55:00 - be a great um
55:03 - this would be a lovely um coding
55:05 - challenge video uh see i feel like i
55:07 - want to like
55:08 - click and drag these
55:11 - press arrow key to start
55:14 - oh up whoa these are like little springy
55:16 - ones
55:18 - that's cool
55:21 - oh my god what have i done
55:28 - ah this is wild is this using um like a
55:31 - like a physics engine like mater.js or
55:34 - is this all yeah it's using matter.js
55:37 - so a matter.js is a physics engine that
55:39 - i use in
55:40 - in different examples of it previously
55:42 - but i haven't in a while
55:43 - this is great uh
55:48 - okay um let's look at the double
55:51 - pendulum
55:51 - just curious if this is a double
55:53 - pendulum also with matter.js
55:56 - can i click or is this just more um oops
55:59 - based on yeah this is also with mata.js
56:02 - cool
56:02 - wonderful thank you for sharing this
56:04 - okay
56:06 - now i know after that twice this is also
56:08 - way too quiet
56:11 - if i put it by the mic you can really
56:14 - hear it
56:17 - uh let us go now to um
56:21 - spring forces and see what we've got
56:23 - we've got
56:24 - three contributions here and i know that
56:26 - there have been other things that people
56:28 - have made i really would love for you to
56:29 - um
56:30 - submit them here because it's hard for
56:31 - me to pull up stuff from discord or
56:34 - twitter or whatever so i love for you to
56:36 - share your things that you make with me
56:38 - through
56:38 - other platforms but this is the central
56:41 - location to collect
56:42 - everything that i might look at on a
56:44 - given live stream okay
56:45 - grab any spring particle by galaton
56:51 - cool oh can i this is very similar
56:54 - visually at least to the example
56:56 - oh but i can grab any part of it oh
56:58 - that's wild so that's the change
57:01 - like i can just grab over here
57:05 - very springy so definitely some of the
57:07 - things i need to
57:08 - i should probably work on with my
57:10 - particular implementation is
57:12 - keeping things a little bit more um
57:19 - a little less chaotic uh all right thank
57:22 - you for that
57:23 - spring force contribution grasp by
57:25 - leonardo
57:30 - this one i have not seen oh cool so
57:34 - this looks like what it must be is it's
57:36 - just
57:37 - like my oh this is so oh oh
57:41 - this is really awesome so i'm just
57:42 - totally speculating here
57:44 - but i think what's being done here is
57:46 - this is literally
57:48 - my connected spring example it might not
57:50 - be
57:51 - but um
57:54 - um and so if you think about that soft
57:57 - string
57:58 - hanging down and you flipped it so that
58:01 - maybe
58:01 - this sort of like pseudo-gravity force
58:03 - is pointing upwards
58:05 - and then maybe there's like some forces
58:08 - some pearl and noise like forces pushing
58:10 - it
58:11 - left and right arbitrarily or just
58:14 - moving the top
58:15 - manually and all the sort of like
58:17 - springy connections
58:18 - are undulating and squiggling
58:22 - around and then even though this might
58:24 - be a sort of
58:25 - you know visualized in the literal way
58:27 - as like circle line
58:28 - circle line by having these strokes
58:32 - of of uh
58:35 - sequentially smaller widths um
58:38 - you really get this like seaweed
58:41 - underwater
58:42 - grass plant form like quality
58:46 - oh and abe is asking will you also take
58:48 - a look at the contributions of the noc
58:50 - series i actually wasn't planning that
58:52 - because i was thinking i'm sort of
58:53 - focused on just looking at
58:54 - the last two videos but um sure i would
58:57 - love to check out um
58:59 - particularly abbe if there was one of
59:00 - yours that you recently submitted that
59:02 - you want me to take a look at i would
59:03 - certainly
59:03 - or anybody else who's watching the chat
59:05 - that's submitted to those videos
59:06 - um please let me know
59:11 - i'm i almost don't want to look at the
59:13 - code because
59:16 - it's just so um beautiful on its own
59:18 - without even
59:19 - unpacking what's below it but i i can't
59:21 - resist
59:22 - so the grass looks like this is like
59:25 - what i did
59:26 - um with a very low k
59:30 - that seems to be something different um
59:33 - there's also a wind
59:34 - force which is new let's see and the
59:36 - wind is just
59:38 - a random amount every time that's
59:41 - interesting
59:42 - so because if the wind is small enough
59:44 - and it's random every time
59:45 - it's not going to like go crazy like
59:47 - this because it's just a little push in
59:49 - one way or the other so you randomly get
59:50 - a few pushes in one direction it'll
59:52 - start to go that way
59:53 - and it might slow back go back that's
59:54 - great um applying the force wind
59:57 - and this looks and i i think the secret
60:00 - here is just really thoughtful rendering
60:03 - um i don't know where that happens
60:06 - really thoughtful rendering
60:07 - and just clever tuning of the values and
60:11 - adding the wind obviously
60:12 - so let's look for where is the rendering
60:14 - happening i'm just curious
60:16 - uh grass update
60:20 - particle update spring show
60:24 - so that's in the show function of the
60:26 - spring and it has a stroke weight that
60:28 - stroke weight
60:29 - changes and is passed in during the loop
60:32 - ah this is such a very clever way of
60:34 - doing this so like this dot
60:36 - total minus i so if this if there's
60:39 - 10 springs the first one is
60:43 - thickness ten then nine then eight and
60:45 - seven etcetera etcetera
60:49 - um okay
60:53 - so simon has shared something for me to
60:55 - click on
60:56 - that um it was a collaboration between
60:58 - him and abe
60:59 - let me grab that real quick
61:02 - um and come back to it
61:06 - are we at break time yet yeah we're just
61:07 - about break time i gotta uh come i'm
61:09 - gonna take a break in a minute here
61:12 - whoa oh this is good it's like
61:15 - what kind of crazy insane code did you
61:18 - all write and i realized oh this is just
61:19 - the open simplex noise implementation
61:22 - okay let's run this
61:27 - lovely lovely lovely
61:31 - so we've got oscillating particles
61:33 - changes in colors
61:35 - actually something that i want to if if
61:36 - you'll end all indulge me for a second i
61:39 - want to explore something this reminds
61:40 - me of
61:41 - um so thank you for creating this um uh
61:43 - wonderful sketch
61:45 - i like how you're using a javascript
61:46 - object for like settings that's kind of
61:48 - like a cool little trick
61:49 - and i could also imagine you loading
61:50 - those from like a json file or something
61:53 - which you've got like a configuration
61:54 - for any particular visualization
61:57 - um but what i actually i if you'll all
61:59 - indulge me for a second i want to look
62:00 - at
62:01 - the video tutorial that i recorded on
62:03 - friday
62:04 - was about how to use an image texture
62:09 - in p5.js with a particle system to
62:12 - create a flame
62:13 - like effect and it was my
62:17 - expectation and let me do a dupe let me
62:19 - duplicate
62:20 - this and when i was trying to do this
62:23 - when i was recording the video itself
62:26 - that if i were to type webgl and use the
62:29 - webgl renderer i would see
62:30 - exactly the same thing
62:34 - would see exactly the same thing but
62:36 - maybe i would be able to get higher
62:38 - performance out of it
62:39 - even though this is a 2d system just to
62:42 - use the hardware acceleration
62:43 - of the webgl implementation in the
62:46 - browser itself
62:46 - when i ran this i see nothing and i see
62:49 - no error
62:50 - so i wanted to try to figure this out so
62:54 - let me just see i'm just gonna um
62:57 - comment out everything like where is the
63:01 - bug
63:08 - so first let me just draw that image
63:13 - yes so there's the image
63:16 - um and if i do sorry if i do background
63:19 - zero
63:21 - there that's the image now if i change
63:24 - this to webgl
63:27 - and i think i just figured out oh it's
63:29 - oh
63:31 - well that's a big issue oh that's
63:35 - all it is actually oh my goodness i'm
63:38 - such a
63:40 - let's say dum-dum but this is i'm not
63:43 - because this is the mistake we
63:45 - all make and forget and do i forgot
63:48 - that the um
63:52 - point of origin in web gel renderer is
63:54 - the center so what if i just
63:56 - like do something which is probably not
63:58 - the best idea but just oh like hold on
64:00 - do this
64:02 - move it back okay great there we go so
64:05 - now i think oh is this i could have
64:06 - included this in the video maybe i will
64:08 - add an addendum to it
64:10 - um let's just see if this now works
64:18 - yeah but why am i not seeing the at the
64:21 - additive blending
64:23 - so why is blend mode ad in webgl
64:27 - i must need something different
64:31 - huh oh but this is good because
64:34 - this ran super super slow
64:39 - and let me just go for a second to the
64:41 - particle
64:42 - and just put the tint back to 255
64:46 - just for a second
64:51 - so this is a smoky like effect
64:56 - and if i go back to the sketch
65:01 - um
65:05 - i'm getting some look at this later um
65:09 - [Music]
65:12 - if i go back to the sketch
65:18 - let me take out blend mode add okay
65:21 - so this ran really really slow so
65:26 - let me take out webgl
65:30 - it still looks kind of different so
65:32 - strange
65:34 - um
65:41 - um and
65:45 - let me i'm sorry i'm thinking here i'm
65:47 - also getting messages by reading
65:50 - direct messages on another platform so
65:52 - apologies for that
65:54 - um okay let's put back webgl
65:58 - no no this is what i want to do if i go
66:00 - and just comment this up
66:01 - what i wanted to look at is if i change
66:04 - emit to five
66:07 - you can see the frame rate here is now
66:11 - quite slow it's running quite
66:14 - slow oh the issue is maybe the clear
66:18 - okay i'll i'll investigate that i needed
66:20 - clear in
66:21 - with the additive blending not in webgl
66:23 - but that could be an issue
66:24 - so what i first thing i want to test is
66:30 - just
66:32 - if i add webgl here
66:35 - yeah so this is awesome super fast
66:40 - okay the webgl render is super fast now
66:44 - uh let me get oh i have the background
66:46 - on let's oh yeah
66:47 - are the clear on no that shouldn't
66:49 - matter
66:50 - uh hold on you know i want background
66:54 - let me take out clear for a second
66:56 - same thing now i'm in webgl
67:03 - you know why is it i think there's a z
67:07 - a layering issue also
67:11 - that the transparency that i have to
67:15 - consider
67:17 - yeah so this this i this i need to
67:20 - figure out like why i've got
67:22 - great performance but what's wrong with
67:26 - um what's wrong with the blending
67:29 - and i suppose
67:34 - a google search is probably not gonna
67:38 - uh 3d okay oh wait
67:42 - subtract
67:46 - so blend mode supposedly
67:49 - okay oh most of these only work no but
67:52 - these say 2d
67:56 - add should work with webgl
68:00 - according to the reference
68:04 - another thing to just make sure is that
68:06 - i am using
68:08 - yeah i'm using the newish version of p5
68:12 - so i'm gonna have to investigate this
68:13 - more later i wanted to see if there was
68:15 - like a quick
68:16 - way that i could figure this out because
68:17 - i love the performance that i'm getting
68:19 - out of this now
68:21 - um add only works for 2d
68:25 - really all right let's try one of the
68:27 - ones that specifically says
68:28 - 3d uh like subtract
68:38 - so let's add let's try subtract
68:42 - well if i'm subtracting not getting
68:44 - anything
68:45 - is the issue there we go
68:50 - interesting
68:53 - oh hold on i think i have an idea
68:57 - oh look at that that's kind of cool if
69:00 - i'm subtracting i can do it that way
69:05 - and then do i and i don't even need the
69:07 - clear clear doesn't do anything does it
69:09 - so that's pretty interesting could i
69:12 - invert this now
69:14 - like watch could i use filter
69:19 - inverse or invert
69:23 - i don't know that that works in webgl
69:27 - no it cannot uh that's
69:32 - crazy
69:35 - fascinating
69:40 - so how why
69:44 - why why why is
69:48 - add i mean ad should really work so let
69:51 - me see uh
69:52 - webgl additive blending
70:00 - no i want really just the web gel
70:20 - so i wonder if i can like sort of break
70:23 - into the lower level webgl
70:24 - code and i would say this is a bug
70:27 - probably in um p5
70:33 - yeah this to me feels like a bug but i'm
70:36 - glad to see this
70:37 - because this is pretty interesting to me
70:39 - now if
70:40 - i were to i think i can get some color
70:44 - out of this
70:46 - by going into the particle
70:54 - there we go kind of like that
71:06 - oh i forgot it's it's the opposite if
71:10 - i'm subtracting
71:18 - it's kind of interesting um
71:27 - well i'm pleased to see that i've gotten
71:30 - somewhere with this
71:31 - i think i should try to do uh
71:34 - investigate this further to see if
71:36 - there's actually a bug in p5 itself
71:39 - to me it feels like there is because how
71:42 - could
71:43 - how could add i mean broadly speaking
71:47 - forget about what p5 has chosen to
71:49 - implement
71:50 - or not um but broadly speaking
71:53 - um if you could do a kind of subtract
71:57 - blend
71:57 - in the web in in native webgl in the
72:00 - browser
72:02 - then there's no reason why the an ad
72:04 - blend wouldn't be possible
72:07 - and additive blending is also one of the
72:09 - most common techniques
72:11 - um in computer graphics in terms of
72:13 - creating fiery
72:15 - glowy-like effects that i have a feeling
72:17 - this is
72:18 - um an error um austin is telling me to
72:21 - try
72:22 - screen okay
72:29 - and i'll have to change the background
72:31 - then to zero
72:34 - oh look at that
72:39 - screen interesting
72:42 - what is screen so now
72:48 - are you telling me that
72:53 - uh
72:59 - uh what i'm losing i've lost the alpha
73:02 - though
73:04 - or is it just that my numbers are so
73:06 - high
73:08 - or do i need the clear no i have clear
73:12 - the clear shouldn't really matter
73:15 - so why am i not getting like it's at the
73:18 - fade
73:21 - why am i not getting the this i wonder
73:24 - if i should actually use the texture
73:28 - um a 1 minus a times b
73:33 - this is pretty interesting though to see
73:36 - [Music]
73:42 - i mean this is kind of a nice effect
73:43 - also but it's not exactly what i'm
73:46 - looking for
73:48 - um
73:58 - oh profit mesh is asking about the live
74:00 - captions yes so i did an experiment
74:02 - where i was getting the live captions
74:03 - from
74:04 - a different service last week and i
74:06 - really liked it and i've been working on
74:07 - trying to
74:08 - get that directly into obs and i wasn't
74:11 - able to get it to work
74:12 - yet um so for today i'm just using the
74:15 - unfortunately the automated live
74:16 - captions from youtube those should be
74:18 - enabled
74:19 - um but um and if if um anybody's
74:21 - interested in helping me with getting
74:23 - um sort of the ape some sort of api
74:26 - working between
74:28 - i would love to connect offline about
74:30 - that because i would like to be able to
74:31 - get a better captioning service
74:33 - um enable alpha for the renderer
74:37 - yeah that is often true
74:41 - um okay
74:44 - all right i'm gonna move on from this
74:46 - because um i only have till three
74:48 - o'clock
74:49 - and i do wanna get to some other things
74:51 - that i want to do today
74:52 - i also need to take a minute to tell you
74:55 - about
74:56 - today's sponsor
75:00 - can i do a drum roll for the sponsor
75:03 - well i'm pressing buttons and getting
75:04 - things set up
75:08 - brilliant
75:11 - all right what is brilliant
75:16 - this is brilliant and maybe i'm going to
75:18 - take away this for a second this is the
75:20 - brilliant website it is
75:21 - a website i would say what i want to
75:24 - show you
75:25 - it's a website wow isn't that like such
75:26 - a brilliant characterization
75:28 - it's a website which is full of
75:31 - learning potential and possibilities if
75:34 - you
75:34 - like the content that i do on the coding
75:37 - train algorithms visualizations
75:39 - math physics the number pi
75:42 - geometry infinity ai and neural networks
75:46 - programming if you like all that stuff i
75:49 - think you might
75:50 - i think you would enjoy um uh brilliant
75:54 - brilliant is uh and the thing that i'm
75:56 - really trying to do with brilliant which
75:57 - is
75:57 - new is i'm trying to think of it as
75:58 - something that i can build into my
76:01 - daily or more likely here for me the way
76:03 - my life works weekly routine
76:04 - so i've set a goal for myself to try to
76:07 - do
76:08 - a lesson from a course
76:12 - one lesson every week let me just pull
76:15 - up here i want to make sure i had some
76:17 - other notes of things that i wanted to
76:19 - sort of say um say about brilliant just
76:23 - to
76:23 - make sure that i'm hitting all the um
76:25 - important points
76:27 - um you know i think for me one of the
76:29 - things that i
76:30 - as a teacher i'm really trying to find
76:33 - ways to
76:34 - inspire the love of learning and the fun
76:37 - of learning and so
76:39 - you know sometimes sort of often
76:41 - traditional ways of learning through
76:42 - kind of tests and memorization um don't
76:45 - can really um they're really kind of a
76:48 - downer in terms of
76:50 - getting that love of learning and so for
76:52 - me um
76:53 - making video tutorials playing around
76:55 - engaging with the community is one way
76:56 - and also having uh going through
76:59 - interactive lessons which
77:00 - have forms and discussions uh and lots
77:03 - of
77:03 - clever fun uh visual ways of and written
77:06 - ways of learning things that's really
77:07 - been
77:08 - uh really increased this sort of like
77:09 - fun and the other thing is there's a lot
77:11 - of topics here that i don't explore
77:13 - um cryptocurrency is one quantum
77:15 - computing is another
77:16 - so there's if you want to join me and a
77:18 - community of eight million learners and
77:20 - educators today
77:21 - um all you have to do is go to
77:24 - brilliant.org
77:26 - codingtrain um you can sign up for free
77:28 - just through that um but you also
77:30 - to unlock everything on the website um
77:32 - the first 200 subscribers uh to do so
77:34 - through that link will get 20 off so the
77:36 - course that i was doing
77:38 - um i don't know why it's not showing up
77:39 - to me here immediately i think i was
77:42 - was it beautiful geometry continue
77:44 - course yeah this is the one that i've
77:46 - been working on i think i'm on lesson
77:47 - two
77:47 - yeah so i'm on lesson two i've done
77:49 - lesson one already
77:51 - and my goal hopefully if you see me next
77:52 - week check with me am i on to lesson
77:54 - four
77:56 - do you guys hear that car alarm going
77:57 - off by the way that's always a lovely
77:59 - thing to happen why
77:59 - welcome to new york city people um
78:03 - so let's see i'm gonna like work through
78:04 - some of these problems the other thing
78:06 - about this to be perfectly honest
78:08 - for me one of the things i like about
78:09 - brilliant is i get lots of ideas for
78:10 - coding tutorials that i want
78:12 - to make um all right so
78:15 - what fraction of this large square has
78:17 - been shaded red
78:19 - okay well i can say that it's more than
78:22 - a quarter
78:24 - right because this is a quarter right
78:26 - here
78:27 - so this is one-eighth so a quarter plus
78:30 - an
78:30 - eighth plus a sixteenth so this is some
78:32 - kind of sequence
78:34 - that i guess when it goes to infinity
78:36 - going to infinity add in
78:38 - add infinitive is latin meaning to
78:40 - infinity it's approaching
78:43 - what and so these lessons here um simon
78:47 - is telling us an avid brilliant user i
78:48 - know is telling me that these lessons
78:49 - are called quizzes thank you
78:53 - um so what is this approach
78:56 - um and i guess i could just like use p5
78:59 - first i could use a calculator
79:00 - but if i were to say like in p5 for a
79:03 - second
79:04 - um like if i were to say like 4
79:08 - let i equal 0 i is less than like 100
79:11 - i plus plus i'm going to start with the
79:15 - sum
79:16 - which is 0.25 sum plus
79:21 - plus equal itself uh divided by two
79:25 - right divided by four oh that wasn't
79:29 - one-eighth
79:30 - yeah it is no no times two oh i'm sorry
79:36 - if that's one let me look back at this
79:39 - this is 1 4 that's 1
79:43 - 16 1 16 that is not 1 8
79:46 - that's 1 16 because it's 1 fourth
79:49 - of one-fourth one-sixteenth so that was
79:52 - right i said that wrong
79:54 - sum uh divided by
79:57 - four and console log if i do that a
80:00 - hundred times what do i get
80:02 - and
80:11 - oh no i don't want to add the whole okay
80:13 - hold on some
80:14 - okay i need a
80:17 - start is i don't think i'm gonna get
80:19 - through this whole lesson today
80:21 - oh and you can't see my code oh i'm the
80:23 - worst um
80:24 - sorry about that everybody let me move
80:26 - this over
80:28 - good thing it was it's okay my code was
80:30 - like terrible anyway
80:31 - because it wasn't right so what i'm
80:33 - doing is i have a sum
80:35 - i'm starting with zero sum
80:38 - plus equal and i'm just going to say
80:39 - value sum plus equal that value
80:43 - then value
80:46 - times equals a quarter and then keep
80:49 - adding it together and together together
80:51 - let's just do that 100 times
80:52 - so stand in for infinity aha
80:55 - point three three three three three
80:57 - three one third
80:59 - i don't have the chat open anymore so
81:00 - people were probably yelling at me yeah
81:02 - one-third plus one-fourth to the power
81:04 - of number and range this is a geometric
81:06 - series okay um austin's right on every
81:10 - scale the red square is one-third of the
81:12 - blue squares that's
81:14 - um okay that's actually a great way of
81:15 - thinking about it
81:17 - that totally makes sense um so let me go
81:20 - back to the brilliant
81:21 - website i'm gonna confidently click one
81:24 - third i'm gonna hit submit
81:25 - i got this right 52 by the way i want to
81:28 - let you know
81:29 - that i get this stuff wrong i don't know
81:31 - what i was gonna say at least a quarter
81:33 - of the time if not more
81:34 - and so to me uh the and i also love the
81:37 - feedback it gives me when i get it wrong
81:39 - because um it's like very positive and
81:42 - affirming
81:43 - and i think like that's part of the
81:44 - learning process is getting it wrong
81:46 - and then i always every time i click on
81:48 - these explanations
81:49 - because i like to see what it says the
81:52 - figure can be thought of as a series of
81:53 - progressively smaller
81:55 - up and down l shapes each
81:58 - one with a dimension half of that of the
81:59 - previous one each individual shape has
82:01 - one red square and two
82:03 - blue squares for a total of three
82:06 - squares so the red makes up
82:07 - one third of each l shape so that would
82:10 - have been
82:11 - a that's an austin in the chat said that
82:13 - that would have been a great way
82:15 - um to think about it for e day next year
82:18 - says braden you should calculate e what
82:19 - day would e
82:20 - day be february something um
82:26 - i wish i could say that it hadn't been
82:28 - several years since i touched a
82:29 - geometric series
82:30 - so this could be actually an approach
82:32 - that i take a geometric
82:34 - series to cut i think oh i did this one
82:36 - i did the geometric series for
82:37 - calculating pi
82:38 - which what was that one called
82:45 - um liebnet's formula yeah i did that on
82:49 - the coding train
82:51 - coding train so this is one i did
82:53 - another year the leibniz formula
82:55 - is a method for approximating pi so
82:58 - um wonderful
83:01 - all right and austin just saw it
83:04 - intuitively which is always great to
83:05 - hear okay
83:06 - i i would like to uh so i'm gonna um you
83:09 - know keep me honest here folks tweet at
83:10 - me message me at the discord
83:12 - let me know did i finish my lesson two
83:14 - later today i'm gonna go through and
83:15 - finish this on my own
83:16 - my goal i'm trying to have a goal of
83:18 - doing one more lesson per week i feel
83:19 - like if i can get through all the
83:20 - courses on brilliant
83:22 - by doing one one lesson or one quiz per
83:24 - week that i'll have had a lot of new
83:26 - ideas and things to be teaching and
83:27 - doing on the coding train
83:28 - um just to mention a couple other
83:30 - courses um if you want to learn python
83:32 - there's a whole course
83:34 - programming with python which is an
83:35 - interactive code editor that's one that
83:37 - i've spent some time with that's really
83:38 - terrific and then a good companion piece
83:40 - to the coding train
83:41 - um is also this neural networks and ai
83:44 - oh
83:45 - just this this course about neural
83:46 - networks on the brilliant website so
83:49 - thank you so much to brilliant for
83:50 - sponsoring
83:51 - these live streams really helps keep the
83:53 - the um
83:55 - the engines running here on the coding
83:56 - train um
83:58 - i really do appreciate it i'm gonna take
83:59 - a short break and if you haven't signed
84:01 - up for brilliant
84:02 - during this break i would highly
84:03 - encourage you to head to brilliant.org
84:06 - codingtrain and i will be back in
84:08 - hopefully less
84:09 - than five minutes
84:17 - [Music]
84:42 - [Music]
84:56 - do
84:58 - [Music]
85:18 - just want to briefly drop in to
85:20 - acknowledge the
85:21 - message from whooshbot thank you so much
85:23 - i happen to be taking a break but i see
85:25 - your wonderful
85:26 - a kind message and the enthusiasm of
85:29 - viewers like you is really what keeps me
85:31 - going so thank you so much
85:40 - [Music]
85:57 - [Music]
86:24 - [Applause]
86:26 - [Music]
86:48 - do
86:53 - [Music]
87:02 - do
87:05 - [Music]
87:16 - do
87:22 - [Music]
87:30 - do
87:33 - [Music]
88:19 - [Music]
88:26 - do
88:31 - all right coming back in just a few
88:32 - minutes
88:34 - uh i'm not a few minutes sorry just like
88:37 - 30 seconds
88:38 - [Music]
88:40 - sorry
88:42 - [Music]
89:08 - do
89:10 - [Music]
89:17 - all right you know it really requires a
89:21 - lot of energy to come to these
89:25 - [Music]
89:37 - but i'm enjoying this i had a lot of
89:39 - energy at the start and i'm starting to
89:41 - fade
89:42 - but i do have some a sort of like
89:45 - and i feel like i also feel like in a
89:48 - way this is like what i want the live
89:49 - streams to be which is just a hangout
89:52 - session um i think maybe it's actually a
89:54 - little less appealing to
89:56 - some of the audience who would much
89:57 - rather just see me like working on
89:59 - like building tetris basically in a
90:01 - two-hour live stream which
90:02 - that kind of thing gets requested a lot
90:05 - and i do aspire to do it actually tetris
90:07 - and funny to mention that is
90:08 - something that i really have high on my
90:09 - list now of um i don't know if that
90:11 - should be like a multi-part coding
90:13 - series or just something i do in the
90:14 - live stream
90:16 - but um i don't know so your feedback is
90:18 - welcome how to make
90:19 - you know my focus right now is really on
90:20 - the tutorial videos that i'm doing
90:23 - um and then i think i will pivot
90:24 - hopefully come around um
90:26 - april or may um to being able to do some
90:29 - other content but um if you have sort of
90:33 - thoughts or feedback about what
90:34 - uh what you like about the videos i
90:38 - release versus the
90:39 - live streams and how to um
90:42 - you know um how it's all feeling for you
90:45 - um it'd be great to hear i mean it's
90:47 - interesting i have finally now
90:50 - separated the live streams
90:54 - from the produced sequence tutorials and
90:58 - coding challenge videos
90:59 - so before it was all the same thing
91:03 - where i would my live stream was really
91:05 - just a live stream of my recording
91:07 - session
91:08 - now i do those recording sessions i
91:09 - still do actually stream those for
91:11 - members to sort of like tune into to
91:13 - like
91:13 - help give me feedback but they're much
91:15 - more of like actual recording session
91:17 - with no community
91:19 - segments um and
91:22 - um jodhwat says plan the comment i see
91:25 - in the chat
91:26 - is a plan and yeah so i'm often
91:28 - wondering do i need more of a plan
91:30 - so anyway your feedback is welcome i'm
91:32 - not gonna be doing that much live
91:33 - streaming to be perfectly honest
91:35 - in the next couple months um there's
91:37 - gonna be two more hopefully in march one
91:39 - or two more in march one will be with a
91:40 - guest
91:41 - um and then and then i'm just taking a
91:43 - few weeks off and alex
91:45 - subscribe to brilliant that's so nice
91:48 - glad to hear all right um
91:52 - i've lost the live the coding train
91:55 - member chat there it is i've got it back
91:58 - um is this the end already guess what
92:01 - it's not
92:03 - i'm off to do one more thing
92:06 - and i had a kind of longer list of but
92:08 - oh just as a reminder
92:10 - if you have um ideas for and thank you
92:12 - to brilliant for the sponsorship
92:14 - um if you have ideas for pi day videos
92:17 - please post those in discord
92:20 - or in the github repo someone can maybe
92:23 - share that
92:25 - um the night sky writes longer beard
92:29 - should make the audience
92:30 - focus better interesting interesting
92:34 - there's there by the way there's like a
92:35 - period of time somewhere in the sort of
92:37 - like
92:38 - um you know beginning of quarantine
92:41 - we're still really in quarantine here um
92:45 - where my beard had gotten i never have
92:47 - gotten that long i saw a
92:49 - i saw like an image of me from one of
92:50 - those live streams and i was like
92:52 - shocked
92:53 - because it didn't seem that crazy to me
92:54 - at the time
92:56 - but like whoa it had gotten really crazy
92:59 - um all right so here's the thing that i
93:01 - need to do
93:03 - i need is some sort of interesting word
93:05 - choice of mine there i mean i
93:08 - i don't know really why i need to do
93:09 - this but um i'm going to go here so
93:12 - all you you know if you've been a coding
93:14 - trained viewer for a while
93:15 - or even recently for a short while that
93:18 - i have an obsession with this book
93:20 - a million random digits with a hundred
93:21 - thousand normal normal deviates i'm
93:23 - still looking for an original print
93:26 - of this book that is fully intact with
93:28 - every page it will be my prized
93:30 - possession if i can ever
93:31 - track down a copy um
93:36 - um but um anyway i have this version and
93:39 - i
93:40 - and i'm i'm working on this project
93:42 - where
93:43 - i'm laser etching and i really should
93:44 - bring the strain whistle that has the
93:47 - actual test
93:48 - laser etch on it laser etching a random
93:50 - walk pattern onto train whistles and
93:52 - sending them as gifts
93:54 - to members of the coding train um
93:58 - and i don't know austin is that question
94:00 - for me because
94:02 - definitely doing more server side stuff
94:04 - recently and i
94:05 - often get the feedback people like why
94:06 - are you doing all this database and blah
94:08 - blah blah
94:08 - stuff um um
94:15 - so i'm reading the chat the same time
94:17 - while i'm talking so i
94:19 - think for the authenticity the total and
94:22 - pure beautiful authenticity of these
94:24 - train whistles
94:25 - and for other things that i want to do
94:27 - like perhaps this pi day video
94:29 - i would like to have access to
94:33 - the random number sequence of 100
94:36 - million digits that is in this book
94:39 - in a i don't know what what i should put
94:41 - in a json file a text file a binary file
94:44 - i'll make a whole web api i'm not sure
94:48 - but so but let me download some of these
94:51 - data file well this is actually all i
94:53 - want
94:55 - i spent a lot of time talking about this
94:57 - oh
94:58 - only to reveal that here it is
95:02 - exactly what i need the 1 million
95:05 - the table of random digits in plain form
95:08 - so what's in these other ones
95:12 - this is in pdf anyway i'm just going to
95:15 - download this one
95:19 - let us open it up
95:22 - let me open it in um
95:26 - just put it on the desktop here and go
95:29 - to terminal
95:37 - what's it called digits.txt
95:42 - and there we go oh interesting this is
95:45 - actually in the file so i'm gonna have
95:46 - to do some parsing of this
95:49 - so the other thing about this right now
95:50 - i remember why i want to do this
95:52 - because i ultimately i have space by the
95:56 - way
95:58 - for one million that'll be
96:01 - i don't know what i'm going to do if i
96:02 - ever have one million people join as a
96:04 - member of the coding train but they're
96:05 - one million spots basically
96:07 - right i would like to produce all one
96:10 - million of these terrain whistles
96:11 - eventually
96:12 - oh oh that could be kind of awesome
96:15 - okay what if like everyone was unique
96:18 - okay this is cool
96:19 - this is cool okay totally i love this i
96:21 - love this okay
96:22 - so first things first let's just do an
96:25 - exploratory session for a moment
96:29 - where um i am going to
96:32 - load this into the discord bot that i've
96:35 - been working on
96:36 - like ultimately in some sense i want to
96:37 - make this a separate project like
96:39 - the random number sequence api project
96:43 - or member coding train member database
96:45 - project
96:46 - but let's wrap it into the discord bot
96:48 - for a second
96:49 - so i'm going to go to very convenient
96:53 - and i know that i said i was going to
96:55 - look at the live poll today
96:59 - sorry about that i'm the worst um
97:02 - [Music]
97:03 - i'm the worst okay so i'm in the image
97:06 - generation i can't remember where i left
97:08 - this off
97:08 - maybe somebody can remember discord bot
97:11 - choo choo
97:15 - um all right did i merge this branch
97:19 - pull request oh
97:23 - oh i've had some
97:29 - oh this is the image generation so why
97:31 - didn't i merge this
97:33 - i don't know i see no reason not to
97:40 - i'm about working this branch a little
97:42 - bit longer so i'm sort of remember i'm
97:44 - gonna go to glitch for a second where i
97:46 - actually have the bot
97:49 - and my very very clever
97:52 - and super amazing way of disabling the
97:55 - bot
97:56 - is to comment out the code so this is
97:59 - the actual
98:01 - deployment of choo choo bot which is
98:03 - running on glitch i should probably
98:05 - i love glitch and i think it makes sense
98:07 - for a lot of things that i do
98:09 - but maybe the discord bot actually
98:10 - should be deployed somewhere else
98:12 - um so now if i let's just see
98:17 - if i'm in the right place here
98:22 - um if i run it
98:25 - what oh i forgot i was trying to i
98:29 - forgot that i was
98:30 - in a speculative place
98:34 - oh right and fun planet showed me how to
98:36 - do this i never follow up on this stuff
98:39 - i'm the worst
98:40 - i gotta get to the summer where i don't
98:42 - have like other work i have to do all
98:43 - week in between live streams and i can
98:46 - like
98:46 - follow up and remember what i've done so
98:48 - hold on hold on everybody
98:50 - uh let me let me open up this pro i'm
98:53 - gonna get there if you will just
98:54 - be patient with me um i'm
98:58 - going to go to generate.js
99:04 - and remove require p5
99:08 - which is all i need to do i think
99:09 - actually i think i just left that
99:12 - in there there we go great so now i
99:13 - think if i go to
99:15 - um discord is this only i don't did i
99:17 - remove the idea of it running only in
99:19 - one channel
99:22 - um so where's my commands.js no but let
99:24 - me take that out
99:27 - um so i'm just going to use my a channel
99:30 - where only i have permission in i think
99:33 - we'll see if this works so i'm going to
99:35 - discord
99:37 - and i'm just going to use this channel
99:39 - like
99:41 - if i do this command
99:47 - i don't have the permissions all right
99:49 - can somebody please
99:53 - oh fun planet there you are you're
99:54 - watching oh fun planet thank you so much
99:56 - for all of those
99:57 - i really like fallen was so excited
99:58 - about that i was like i want to make
100:00 - actually and i would love to collaborate
100:03 - on this or if you just want to like go
100:04 - for it i will
100:05 - really support and champion you but i
100:07 - wanted to make a lot node library
100:09 - that was not that was like a node p5
100:12 - library
100:13 - that allowed you to do p5 in node but
100:15 - didn't actually
100:16 - have um well either had that didn't have
100:20 - i don't know how to best do this i
100:23 - didn't want to like
100:24 - change the p5 code itself i want this to
100:27 - be a wrapper of some additional code
100:29 - so that as the p5 library grows and
100:32 - changes over time
100:33 - it can always just stay in sync with it
100:35 - but we're not
100:36 - um so that's that's kind of my
100:39 - my plan so um did i vamp long enough is
100:42 - there somebody who's a mod here
100:44 - um who can um who can fix the
100:47 - um and maybe i'll just do it myself i'm
100:49 - going to try to fix the permissions of
100:51 - the bot
100:52 - testing channel
100:56 - um so how do i do that um
101:02 - channel edit channel
101:06 - permissions advanced permissions
101:10 - is what i want um
101:13 - everyone see i don't know how to do this
101:16 - quickly
101:17 - i'm gonna make everyone not be able to
101:18 - send messages
101:20 - i think this is fine i think that might
101:22 - have been enough
101:24 - somebody can hopefully fix it for me but
101:26 - i'm back so i'm in this channel
101:27 - which should have
101:32 - the bot going and that was
101:35 - running right from here uh did i call it
101:38 - generate
101:39 - was it random walk oh yeah there we go
101:42 - great
101:44 - i don't see any console logging happens
101:46 - which makes me nervous
101:51 - like like i don't i seriously don't have
101:54 - like a console log
101:57 - uh it's just
102:11 - okay okay great i'm in the right code
102:14 - my bot is running so this is what i
102:17 - sorry for that i've got
102:18 - i've got 20 minutes here to do um uh to
102:22 - do about what i want to do so i'm going
102:23 - to take this
102:24 - file digits.dxt txt
102:28 - i am going to put it into
102:31 - uh discord bot choo choo commands
102:35 - um the question is where to store it
102:40 - let's just store it here in the root
102:42 - directory for right now
102:45 - is this by the way are these tabs i'm
102:47 - not sure
102:48 - and then um
102:52 - let's go to uh the code
102:56 - i can close this so i've got the digits
102:59 - here
103:00 - now in this command
103:03 - i do want the file system
103:08 - and i want to say uh digits equals or
103:11 - i'm just going to say raw
103:13 - digits equals file system read file sync
103:21 - how do i do this like something like
103:23 - this if i want to go back one directory
103:26 - i should know this kind of stuff
103:29 - and then and then i want to say
103:33 - [Music]
103:37 - utf-8
103:41 - okay so i'm loading the raw digits
103:45 - i need a little bit more room for the
103:47 - code here
103:50 - then um let's just see if that works
104:03 - okay that worked so there's all the raw
104:06 - digits
104:06 - now i need to um
104:11 - now i need to chop this up to make it an
104:13 - array of all the digits
104:15 - but i need to so i guess like
104:25 - like what if i do split and i split it
104:28 - by a regular expression which is just
104:30 - any white space
104:38 - let's see what i got
104:42 - okay great so then how do i get rid of
104:46 - all of the
104:47 - row numbers which i don't need so if
104:50 - there
104:50 - are in the digits file one two
104:53 - three four five six seven
104:57 - eight nine ten so
105:00 - every so 0 9
105:04 - i'm sorry 0 10 20 if the index modulus
105:07 - 10 is 0. so should i use filter
105:17 - i'll call it randoms digits filter
105:22 - is there like can i in the filter
105:24 - function can i get an
105:28 - index
105:32 - so i want to filter out or is this or is
105:34 - this all that i want to keep so i'm
105:36 - using this
105:37 - higher order javascript function i
105:38 - thought i have no idea if this will work
105:40 - to basically filter out everything
105:44 - um oh i could split with the line break
105:47 - says arnab that's a smart idea
105:49 - so but let's see if this works this i
105:51 - want to filter out every tenth element
105:54 - um let's see if this works
105:58 - i also could use the spaces between the
105:59 - row number and the data yeah there's
106:01 - lots of other ways i could do this
106:11 - uh did that work doesn't seem like it
106:28 - yes does not
106:32 - does not equal zero well hold on
106:36 - oh i had console log digits still in
106:37 - there so maybe that did work
106:39 - or if it did it did the hold on
106:43 - i think that might have hold up
106:46 - console.log randoms.length
106:55 - 000 that is not right
107:07 - 22 000 interesting
107:10 - i wonder if as i'm filtering it if the
107:16 - all right let's split it up let's let's
107:18 - do it um let's do rows
107:21 - by rows and i can concat all right
107:29 - let's try this
107:35 - okay that kind of seems right
107:41 - right okay so now what if i
107:47 - uh rows
107:59 - so for every row of rows
108:04 - [Music]
108:07 - digits equals rho dot split
108:11 - by any number of spaces
108:17 - and then uh splice
108:20 - the first one out
108:24 - there's 11 index modulus 11
108:28 - there's 11.
108:33 - one two three four five six seven eight
108:35 - nine ten
108:36 - oh but because the number is there it's
108:38 - eleven
108:39 - oh so that would have totally worked
108:44 - okay let's go back i i don't know i
108:47 - couldn't like my brain couldn't make
108:48 - that
108:49 - happen uh um hold on i'm gonna keep this
108:55 - because i like what i'm uh people were
108:58 - saying that to me in the chat
109:00 - and i was not i was just like what
109:02 - that's weird that's not right i just
109:03 - like completely ignored it but
109:05 - i just see it uh thank you arnov for
109:07 - like
109:09 - being very clear about that let's okay
109:12 - so
109:12 - this should be
109:16 - and i just want to save this other way
109:19 - that i was trying it
109:23 - so let's see if this gets it to me uh
109:29 - oh digits
109:33 - should be an s oops i've kind of missed
109:35 - some things here there we go
109:41 - hundred thousand
109:51 - twenty thousand and one that's weird
110:00 - does um a line break not count as white
110:08 - space
110:12 - it's definitely not equals
110:18 - did i download the wrong file
110:25 - did i download the wrong file
110:37 - why are there only why are there
110:41 - 220 0001 numbers
110:45 - and not 1 million
111:12 - hmm all right hold on let's go back to
111:16 - my rows
111:17 - splitting for a second
111:21 - do i i don't need a g there with split
111:23 - do i for global
111:28 - uh oh i hear my i have a feeling cooking
111:31 - class bacon class has ended it's digits
111:33 - not numbs
111:39 - so weird okay hold on let me let me go
111:42 - back to my more manual way of doing this
111:59 - 20 000 yeah
112:06 - it's a million digits it's never been a
112:10 - million numbers
112:13 - i've been wrong this whole time my whole
112:17 - life i've completely misunderstood this
112:19 - book
112:20 - and i never bothered to check
112:25 - is this about this
112:28 - i'm so confused
112:34 - i got hold on a sec
112:37 - there are 200 000 numbers all this time
112:40 - i could have read this my whole life is
112:42 - alive
112:44 - this whole time i only had to there's
112:46 - only i've i've been thinking there's a
112:47 - million random numbers in this book
112:49 - there's only 200 000 which is fine
112:51 - that makes my life easier thank you very
112:53 - much and you need your stupid 1 million
112:55 - numbers anyway
112:57 - does he probably say this right in the
112:58 - introduction
113:00 - um am i supposed to think of this as
113:03 - random numbers
113:04 - zero through nine
113:10 - the random numbers in this book were
113:11 - produced by a re-randomization of a
113:13 - basic table generated by an electronic
113:15 - roulette wheel
113:28 - should but how should i be thinking of
113:30 - this
113:32 - should i be thinking of the
113:35 - book as a million i could by the way i
113:38 - could only take 200
113:40 - 000 members now of the coding trade i
113:41 - can no longer have one million members
113:44 - i got to re i read the whole
113:45 - introduction but like years ago
113:47 - and i i obviously didn't retain what's
113:49 - in it and i don't think i could just
113:50 - reasonably read it right now
113:56 - um so the question is there are 200 000
113:58 - i'm going to still consider them
114:02 - five digit numbers so for the sake of
114:04 - argument right now i'm going to consider
114:06 - them five
114:06 - digit numbers um and only
114:10 - um yeah because i want to have i want to
114:13 - have 200 000
114:14 - unique are they unique or all well let's
114:18 - find out
114:19 - i need to find i need to know right now
114:21 - if all the numbers are unique
114:23 - all the five digit numbers are unique
114:27 - no well no they can't be
114:31 - they can't be unique
114:37 - they are bunched up in fives but you can
114:39 - choose any number of the digits to form
114:41 - your own random numbers as big or small
114:43 - as
114:43 - like that is the idea
114:47 - but how do i use them grouping random
114:49 - digits zero to nine into groups of five
114:51 - does give you random numbers
114:54 - zero to ninety nine thousand nine
114:56 - hundred ninety nine i guess
114:57 - yeah can you see if any of the random
115:00 - numbers begin with one or more zeros
115:02 - they do
115:03 - they do they absolutely do
115:08 - um
115:12 - chris writes i was going to join the
115:14 - channel but now that seems like rubbing
115:16 - it in
115:17 - right there's no way that they're unique
115:18 - but they're not unique
115:20 - how many unique ones are there
115:24 - and so if you get a random number you
115:26 - get it all over the book
115:29 - all right we're gonna keep them we're
115:32 - gonna keep them as
115:33 - five i mean i'm gonna make a just sort
115:35 - of executive decision right now
115:38 - good news is my algorithm here is
115:40 - correct
115:45 - this should give me two hundred thousand
115:46 - five digit numbers
115:49 - two hundred thousand perfect
115:52 - so now i would like to sort this array
115:57 - um so let's do
116:01 - i forg always forget does sorting the
116:03 - array actually change the array i think
116:04 - it does
116:05 - random sort um
116:17 - oh this is more than i have time for
116:19 - right now
116:26 - okay so i've sorted them
116:31 - so is every number there is one question
116:36 - and um
116:42 - yes every number there i need to do like
116:44 - a
116:47 - array to set what if you convert array
116:50 - to set
116:51 - oh that's an interesting idea
116:57 - i was going to manually filter them
116:59 - myself
117:00 - like into groups
117:04 - and
117:08 - every number is not there
117:18 - right if if zero is there four times
117:21 - by definition that means there's not
117:23 - enough space for every number
117:25 - pigeonhole principle i've heard this
117:27 - term before
117:29 - pigeonhole principle
117:36 - yeah yeah
117:41 - ten pigeon nine whole since 10 is
117:43 - greater than nine at least one whole lot
117:44 - of
117:45 - set is actually a good idea okay uh
117:48 - javascript
117:50 - set
117:54 - i wanted to count how many each was in
117:56 - there but that's overkill for right now
117:59 - uh so if somebody's random oh that's why
118:02 - the
118:02 - column and row the index of the random
118:04 - number is actually important
118:06 - that's going to affect okay so there's
118:08 - still 200 000
118:10 - spots if the idea is that you're getting
118:11 - a spot in the sequence even if you have
118:14 - the same random number now i should try
118:16 - to give people unique random numbers
118:18 - but if the idea is that you're getting
118:20 - your random walk
118:22 - it's going to be 200 000 iterations
118:26 - you're getting all okay okay so
118:29 - i'm actually not going to worry about
118:31 - this right now
118:32 - just for a moment that will come later
118:38 - what i want to do is
118:43 - um so i'll come back to all this and
118:46 - probably be worth making it actually be
118:49 - worth
118:49 - totally making an api oh here's a
118:51 - project for us as a coding trained
118:53 - community
118:53 - let's make an api which has the raw text
118:57 - of the sequence
118:58 - and then you can ask it for like give me
119:01 - um
119:02 - one million numbers random numbers zero
119:04 - through nine
119:05 - give me uh 500 000 numbers
119:08 - zero through 19 basically um
119:12 - so um so that would be that's a great
119:14 - that's another project but let me just
119:16 - follow this through a little bit more
119:18 - so um so i'm going to call this random s
119:23 - which is the strings and then randoms
119:26 - equals random s map
119:32 - parse int elt
119:36 - so this should give it to me as actual
119:38 - numbers
119:43 - okay so now i've got them as actual
119:45 - numbers
119:46 - and there's 200 000 of them and what i
119:49 - want to do is i want the argument
119:53 - of the message
119:57 - i want to give it a seed
120:01 - so if args
120:04 - dot length is greater than zero
120:08 - so let's have let seed equal
120:12 - random math math.random
120:16 - times randoms.length and
120:19 - floor that
120:24 - then if args.length is greater than zero
120:28 - then seed equals um parseint
120:32 - args index zero
120:36 - you know i should check if it um i'll
120:39 - add it to do here
120:40 - to do uh check that argument
120:44 - is valid number
120:47 - between zero and um
120:51 - right 199 999 right then i'm going to
120:54 - call
120:54 - generate image seed so we're going to
120:57 - get the seed here
120:59 - we're not going to do it a million times
121:02 - i start to zero i
121:03 - is less than randoms.length
121:09 - [Music]
121:12 - and then the number r is
121:16 - random randoms index
121:19 - i plus seed modulusrandoms.length
121:24 - is that right let me put that in a
121:25 - separate variable index equals
121:28 - i plus the seed modulusrandoms.length
121:33 - so this this should
121:37 - pull and then this should be that
121:40 - number modulus 4.
121:44 - so this should take the seat from from
121:46 - any it's not actually the seed value
121:49 - i should not call it seed right now
121:51 - because i might want to use it as a seed
121:52 - eventually but this is really starting
121:55 - index is really what this is
122:00 - and i'll just call it offset because
122:02 - it's really the offset
122:04 - i plus offset so the idea being that
122:08 - i'm going to always produce the same
122:10 - exact random number pattern
122:13 - um by starting at a certain number in
122:16 - the sequence of 200
122:18 - 000 numbers and then iterating over all
122:20 - of them from there
122:23 - and ultimately i could go through it
122:24 - twice or something but let's see what
122:25 - this let's see what this gives me
122:30 - all right so let's go to discord
122:33 - type generate let's see what i go oh it
122:36 - should tell me the
122:37 - shoot so i want it also to
122:44 - return
122:47 - um return the buffer and also let me do
122:50 - this again
122:51 - um so the attachment is so this
122:55 - is um then i can also say buffer
122:58 - dot index
123:01 - here's your random walk starting at
123:06 - index right that should
123:09 - let me just make sure do this work
123:14 - oh why'd i get an error there let's see
123:16 - what happens i
123:17 - did get an error oh we got an error
123:20 - let's see
123:22 - random is not defined where
123:29 - ah randoms.length this is a terrible
123:32 - name for a variable by the way
123:33 - randoms terrible name for a variable but
123:38 - let's see if this works
123:44 - let's just make sure the bot is live
123:48 - by the way i hate that this is called
123:49 - generate it should be called
123:52 - let me rename it now the now is not the
123:54 - time i want to change the command to
123:56 - random walk or something
123:58 - generate
124:01 - at undefined good work everybody here's
124:04 - your random walk starting at
124:06 - undefined why is that undefined
124:10 - uh
124:13 - return buffer oh it's called offset
124:17 - well no wonder i can't just make up a
124:18 - variable name here
124:26 - okay um
124:29 - i mean i guess i know what it is because
124:31 - i have it here
124:32 - so this is silly for me to get it back
124:35 - oh yeah i don't need to get it back it's
124:37 - picked here
124:38 - what am i doing i mean it's good it's
124:41 - like
124:42 - now i'm making sure it's right but um
124:48 - that was silly let's just do
124:52 - that okay
124:56 - here we go generate
125:01 - it got an error the resource must be a
125:05 - string
125:06 - buffer or val oh
125:10 - oh i'm still doing this though
125:14 - took it out of here
125:19 - no what am i doing where am i
125:28 - okay
125:32 - oh hold on i'm getting some messages
125:34 - breaking news here uh-oh
125:37 - things aren't good downstairs in baking
125:39 - class i've gotta go
125:41 - okay 8063 so here
125:45 - here is the real test
125:50 - ah
125:52 - [Music]
125:53 - that is so good who's who just joined
125:57 - what was terence's random number
125:59 - who joined
126:03 - uh i'm still returning yeah oh no you're
126:07 - behind me
126:07 - chat you're behind i already fixed that
126:09 - um let's just generate zero
126:13 - generate zero
126:17 - beautiful all right this is good we're
126:20 - getting the unique
126:21 - pattern for any given number
126:24 - in the sequence of 200 000 numbers
126:29 - yes now if i wanted to have it be one
126:31 - million numbers
126:32 - i really could because
126:37 - um
126:40 - because i only have four options for the
126:42 - random walker so i guess i can make that
126:43 - decision later
126:45 - but i want to just change a couple of
126:46 - things
126:48 - [Music]
126:50 - one is
126:53 - first i don't need to do this console
126:57 - log anymore
127:00 - um loading sequence of random numbers
127:06 - i so that's done i also want to change
127:09 - this command to rename
127:12 - i'm going to call this random walk
127:16 - and update imports for random walk
127:19 - i don't know sure yes
127:22 - um what does that do oh
127:26 - random walk
127:29 - random walk okay i think that
127:33 - actually should be all that i need to do
127:34 - to change it i should probably put this
127:36 - back
127:38 - to only being in the bot testing channel
127:41 - because that's sort of the point of this
127:43 - particular bot
127:48 - and now hello oh it's
127:51 - it's running um choo choo
127:56 - now generate should give me nothing
127:57 - except it gives me an error
127:59 - because i don't have any error handling
128:01 - it's just the words
128:04 - i thought i added error handling maybe
128:05 - there's a pull request for it
128:07 - generate so now i should be able to say
128:09 - random walk
128:12 - it'll give me a random one so the idea
128:14 - also could be that
128:15 - it would look up in the database my
128:18 - random number and give me that one
128:20 - or i could request a specific one um by
128:25 - and this should still be the same
128:28 - this is still the same image as this one
128:30 - right so we're in good shape
128:32 - now um there also was a pull request i
128:34 - saw that somebody did wrap around
128:36 - so that it would sort of like also come
128:38 - maybe over here if it was going up to
128:39 - the top so
128:39 - maybe i should add that as well but this
128:41 - is good i'm going to say
128:45 - uh get an ad
128:49 - adding the random digits sequence
128:52 - from book um i am
128:56 - um finishing up by the way this is it
128:58 - this is the end of today's live stream
129:00 - i'm gonna deploy this uh hopefully
129:04 - i'm gonna um throw caution to the wind
129:07 - and find the github repo
129:11 - uh for this particular
129:15 - pull request which is now got this i'm
129:19 - going to merge it
129:23 - i'm going to cancel it uh here it's not
129:26 - running
129:27 - then i'm going to go do my ridiculous
129:29 - way on glitch
129:31 - of whoops of of making the bot run
129:35 - so i'm going to go to tools
129:39 - import and export and by the way i'm
129:43 - never supposed to i should not be
129:45 - showing this but i think there's enough
129:46 - characters
129:48 - that are covered up i suppose somebody
129:50 - could probably
129:52 - now check all the possibilities and
129:53 - eventually get it
129:55 - good luck to you i'll just have to uh
129:58 - delete and recreate this project or
130:00 - something
130:01 - um but that's sort of a problem that
130:04 - that just shows up here
130:06 - and now i'm going to do this
130:21 - and then
130:24 - uh it should be
130:28 - running now
130:35 - hold on oh it's still like
130:39 - installing some stuff
130:47 - okay
130:54 - great
131:09 - hi code guppy thank you very kind wait
131:13 - did the 8063 look the same
131:18 - it's similar it's very similar
131:21 - it's a very similar the sequence is
131:23 - always the same you have to remember
131:24 - that it's just where you start
131:26 - so the patterns are actually going to be
131:28 - quite like like if i
131:30 - now if i say random
131:34 - walk one like how different is this
131:36 - going to be
131:41 - pretty pretty pretty similar
131:44 - i can't even tell the difference at all
131:46 - so is that a problem
131:48 - it kind of is but i think that
131:52 - there's still two hundred thousand like
131:54 - if i do one hundred thousand
131:59 - i think it's going to be pretty diff oh
132:01 - sorry random walk
132:07 - so um maybe there's a better way to do
132:09 - this to have them all be more unique
132:12 - um but you can see that they are there
132:15 - are
132:16 - this one is quite different 8063 is not
132:19 - that far away
132:20 - from zero considering touring papa the
132:22 - sun is out oh my goodness
132:24 - it is 3 p.m the sun is out i think it's
132:27 - over 50 degrees fahrenheit here
132:29 - um code guppy you are much too kind
132:32 - these donations are
132:33 - very very appreciated but definitely
132:35 - unnecessary um
132:37 - it is going well thank you for the super
132:38 - stickers and
132:40 - i am going to
132:45 - say goodbye so i got some stuff
132:49 - accomplished today please
132:50 - share with me your oh oh am i blowing
132:53 - everybody's ears out
132:55 - how's the volume of that song right now
132:57 - let me know before i keep playing it
133:00 - um
133:02 - um skip digits different like there's
133:04 - all sorts of ways i could vary this but
133:06 - that's kind of not the point right
133:08 - the point is we're all getting a random
133:10 - walk according to the book
133:12 - slight variations um but it sounds like
133:15 - i am being called away
133:18 - so um i'm just gonna like lower the
133:21 - volume to be safe down here
133:23 - uh are the blondies ready
133:29 - okay but i should stop now huh i'm still
133:31 - i'm currently live streaming
133:33 - but i'm i'm wrapping up all right um
133:36 - it is beautiful outside nice and sunny
133:38 - in michigan are we gonna go out to the
133:39 - park
133:40 - no i'm reading the chat somebody from
133:42 - michigan wrote a nice message in the
133:44 - chat
133:45 - it's we're not in michigan we're in
133:48 - brooklyn
133:50 - all right um my children are here they
133:53 - gave
133:53 - they were kind enough to allow me these
133:55 - two hours of live streaming with you
133:57 - it's actually been about two hours and
133:58 - 10 minutes
134:00 - i'm gonna let this um yeah osama is
134:03 - saying look for a json file with a
134:05 - random one million numbers
134:06 - i could find that that's not the point
134:08 - the point is
134:10 - this is the book the coding trade bible
134:13 - so to speak if you will
134:15 - um this is our text our you know if
134:18 - um hopefully i'm not like by accident
134:20 - starting some sort of strange um
134:22 - cult here go to trade cult but this is
134:25 - this is the core
134:26 - text so i want to tie everything to this
134:28 - book um
134:29 - just for fun thank you austin oh yes for
134:31 - reminding me
134:32 - to thank brilliant um the sponsor push
134:35 - to get it is pushed
134:37 - um i'm also gonna um unlock the bot
134:40 - testing channel
134:41 - and let me do that um
134:45 - let me go to here and go to permissions
134:48 - and go to
134:49 - advanced and back to
134:53 - everyone being able to send messages
134:57 - save changes and i'm going to leave
135:02 - and now you should be able to work with
135:05 - the bot yourself in the discord
135:07 - codingtrain.com
135:08 - discord link in the chat that i just
135:11 - posted as well
135:12 - um thank you for telling me it was a fun
135:15 - stream jiao dat i appreciate that
135:18 - i can't hear the music at all can you um
135:22 - [Music]
135:24 - and stay tuned uh there's a
135:27 - self-avoiding walk coding challenge that
135:29 - needs to come out there are four
135:31 - chapter four of nature of code videos
135:32 - that are on their way
135:34 - i have a little short five minute video
135:37 - about a template literal in javascript
135:39 - that i have
135:40 - not seemed to manage to produce that has
135:42 - a theme song
135:44 - so that's coming out soon and
135:48 - um i will see you all maybe so
135:51 - the next live stream i mean just check
135:53 - you know subscribe all that nonsense
135:55 - stuff um you know
135:56 - i will say that i'm pretty low and i
135:59 - look let me pause for a second
136:00 - when i look at my stats i could i would
136:02 - pull them up if i felt confident how to
136:04 - do that
136:04 - it shows me how many people who have
136:06 - subscribed have notifications
136:08 - on and that how and also as a percentage
136:11 - how many people have notifications on
136:13 - as well as all notifications on for my
136:16 - channel
136:16 - i really low like i have a very large
136:19 - number of subscribers
136:20 - but a really low percentage of people
136:22 - with the notifications on
136:24 - so if you don't know about that fee i'm
136:26 - not asking you to turn those
136:27 - notifications on if you don't want to
136:28 - get them
136:29 - i don't want to spam people but if
136:32 - you're not aware of that feature
136:34 - um i would encourage you to go and do
136:36 - that right now in terms of
136:37 - that will give you certainly like when i
136:40 - schedule a live stream
136:42 - that will then show up as a notification
136:45 - when i am live streaming and then of
136:46 - course when new videos are posted as
136:47 - well
136:47 - so a little bit of plug for myself um
136:52 - you know ring the bell hit that bell
136:54 - whatever i mean
136:55 - but but i i i find that the whole like
136:59 - you know it's just noise at this point
137:00 - if you're watching a video and somebody
137:02 - says
137:02 - don't forget to subscribe and click that
137:04 - bell it's just like it's everywhere so
137:06 - you know i i want to be like
137:07 - conscientious about asking you to do
137:09 - things
137:10 - but i do think there might be a little
137:11 - bit of a disconnect where a lot of the
137:13 - viewers either
137:14 - maybe rightfully so don't don't want
137:17 - they want notification
137:18 - and this could make sense actually like
137:19 - maybe you only want notifications from
137:22 - a youtube channel that does like once a
137:24 - month
137:25 - high quality video 10 minutes long well
137:28 - produced
137:29 - uh you really just want to make sure you
137:30 - watch their monthly 10-minute video
137:32 - whereas a coding channel might have
137:34 - weekly live streams tutorials popping up
137:35 - every few days and it's just a mess of
137:37 - notifications for you but
137:39 - so i'm going to stop talking about all
137:41 - of that um and just thank all of you
137:44 - uh for being here today there's about 10
137:46 - seconds left in this song
137:48 - and i will see you i'm join the discord
137:50 - i'm gonna leave this chat will be open
137:52 - for a little bit because i'll play some
137:53 - outro music so if you're not sure about
137:55 - how to join the discord how to engage
137:57 - with the community how to get your
137:58 - notifications turned on
138:00 - how to join as a member all that stuff
138:01 - you can ask it in the chat all right and
138:03 - i will see you all next time on the
138:05 - coding train
138:06 - as always i always forget that this dot
138:15 - these p5.js hearts oh my goodness
138:18 - i uh i knocked over the music
138:25 - as always these p5.js dots are a symbol
138:28 - of my love
138:29 - for you the viewers of the coding train
138:31 - for all the people of the world
138:33 - coders and non-coders alike i see
138:36 - i spy through the window there a
138:38 - beautiful sunny day
138:40 - i don't know what the weather is like
138:41 - might be the middle of the night for you
138:43 - but take some time away from your
138:44 - screens from your computers from your
138:46 - coding if you can
138:48 - it's hard to be with people these days
138:50 - but you can be with sunshine or
138:52 - nature or fresh air or a book
138:55 - stumble up with a book a painting of
138:57 - drawing something um
138:58 - find that for yourself at least today
139:00 - thank you to
139:02 - [Music]
139:03 - brilliance who is the sponsor and
139:05 - certainly
139:07 - uh when after you've taken your break
139:08 - from the computer uh
139:10 - i just stopped talking goodbye
139:15 - i can't find the button to take me out
139:17 - of here i found it now
139:29 - never forget this dot somebody composed
139:32 - that song for me
139:46 - i'm gonna say once again here we go
139:49 - sing it with me it's the forward new
139:52 - cartesian
139:53 - coordinate song
139:55 - [Music]
139:59 - it's the forward to cartesian
140:11 - [Music]
140:14 - coordination
140:17 - autotune and the internet will fix that
140:19 - for me
140:24 - sing it with me it's the polaroid
140:32 - [Music]
140:42 - i noticed people by the way in the chat
140:43 - are talking about the weather where they
140:45 - are which i'm
140:45 - enjoying seeing as i'm kind of like
140:47 - cleaning up and getting things turned
140:49 - off here
140:49 - um uh and i forgot to do this beginning
140:52 - i like to give a prompt and have
140:53 - everybody sort of answer the prompt in
140:55 - the chat and one of the ones i usually
140:56 - do is just like where are you where are
140:58 - you right now and i don't mean like give
140:59 - me your latitude of longitude
141:01 - but like what country what city are you
141:03 - from um and chris sears just joined
141:08 - chris sears you waited you waited
141:12 - until the very last moment but yeah
141:15 - you know you will get a random number
141:19 - i had to come back to give you your very
141:22 - own random number chris sears whose name
141:24 - i see quite often in the chat and i'm
141:26 - glad to maybe see your profile photo and
141:28 - see you in the discord
141:30 - uh we're going to give you on page 96
141:34 - row 4770 column
141:38 - one eighty eight thousand two eight
141:41 - eight two two seven
141:42 - eight eight i'm gonna think of these as
141:43 - sequences of five digits now eight eight
141:45 - two two seven so the important thing is
141:47 - your index right
141:48 - your index is and we should be able to
141:50 - figure this out because it's
141:52 - ten for if you're in row four seven
141:54 - seven zero
141:56 - column index one it's the second column
141:58 - zero one
141:59 - that's where you are that's the
142:00 - important thing um and i'm seeing where
142:02 - people are from
142:03 - in the chat um i i love that and i am
142:06 - going back to the last song
142:08 - and here it comes unicorns and rainbows
142:10 - and cupcakes what else
142:12 - is there yes kittens
142:15 - thank you very much kittens and rainbows
142:17 - i i see chris
142:18 - that we're trying to fly on the red it's
142:20 - a great message so i have lights that
142:21 - blink when somebody joins
142:24 - it's very obvious to me
142:38 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

do do good afternoon everyone uh check one two i am just testing my mic let me know if you can hear me okay i do have the music volume up a little higher than i usually do so you can confirm for me whether it's a little too loud and i'll be starting in approximately one minute do so do hello happy saturday it's the coding trade again here we are every saturday even when i said i don't know when this was was it it was definitely at the start of january i think if not earlier if i would no longer be live streaming on the weekends because the weekends is not a convenient time for me to live stream and yet here we are again another saturday afternoon i am live streaming it turns out it's not exactly a convenient time but it is more convenient than the other times during the week that i thought might work out someday this will all change but for now i am here on saturdays actually just to get this out of the way the schedule is going to be quite light for the next couple months in terms of live streams there's a lot of new content coming out on the channel so you will get your fill of coding train without a doubt if you're interested in that but in terms of the live streams just to let you know um i will be live streaming next weekend most likely but that's like 50 50. then i will 100 definitely be live streaming put this in your calendar on march 19th that's not 100 actually let's put that at like 90 to 95 percent i have a guest coming and i will soon put that as an event on the youtube calendar of events because a youtube calendar event no but i will make it a scheduled live stream on the channel so it will appear on the youtube coding train home page on youtube and then i am going to be out of town not actually not really out of town i'm still going to be in new york but i will not be in brooklyn for a few weeks so there won't be unless something changes and i find some miraculous way with a good internet connection to live stream during that time i will there will be no streams between approximately march 20th and april 10th um so uh so there will be a bit of a lull there but lots of new content and uh you probably are aware i want to say hi to folks in the chat and see what's going on here but you're probably aware the focus right now of the coding train is most definitely on um nature of co tutorial so if you've just if you haven't been around in a while you're tuning in maybe for the first time ever or after a while and you haven't been following what's been going on the channel if you go to the codingtrain.com learning nature of code and uh you'll see this playlist of videos all of which were completed uh a year ago in the spring of 2020 then i had i don't know if you know a family know about what happened in the year 2020 a lot let me just say uh kind of lost steam with this project but i have firmly returned to it here in 2021 and all of the chapter 3 videos have been completed and published and guess what all of the chapter 4 videos which is only four videos four videos for chapter four four being the only number in the english language that has the length is the number of letters in the word of the number itself did you know that interesting facts by the way i kind of want to just completely change the coding train to a channel called facts about numbers i i've been sending these emails to my nyu course and i try to include a little like tidbit about like a number in them and then i realized like oh i love this so much maybe i should go through my random number book and just uh uh just completely pivot the content is just me it's asmr facts about numbers uh reading on the coding train anyway i was saying chapter four uh particle systems four new videos they've all been recorded it may take a little while for them to be publicly available on the channel this is my small little plug that if you would like a sort of sneak preview of those as they're in process so rough drafts and early versions i will share with members of the coding train in the coding train discord now the coding terrain discord which i will press this button is uh hopefully it just appeared in the chat it's available to everyone i encourage you to join we have a lot of new moderators shout out and thank you to the new moderators um it's a place where hopefully it's welcoming and friendly a familyfriendly place where you can get um help with your code there's a lot of different help channels i could show you these things right now but i'm just going to talk um certainly if you're running into any issues on the discord and you have ideas for things that you think we could do to improve it and by improve it i mean improve the sort of community vibe the inclusive nature what i hope and want for that discord um please definitely like reach out to the moderation team um um yeah so um pratyush roy in the chat is asking um that you're not on discord because you are under 13. when you turn 13 please join absolutely so i believe that the discord this is uh you know out of my hands so to speak um although well um but the the um terms of service or discord are um you have to be 13 or older okay um what am i looking at the chat so what's the deal with these live streams if these are sequence tutorial videos that appear on the coding train why am i here i don't know actually i've kind of lost track of what the whole thing with the coding train is why i'm here oh the uh i was plugged i don't know you tell me why am i here well i would like to engage and connect with the community to some small extent by the way i have a little bit of a problem i've been kind of obsessively on clubhouse which is an audio only on social network i think it's only ios only which is kind of ridiculous but i assume that's just because i haven't had the time to develop it for other platforms yet but i own clubhouse about a half an hour ago now it's at 12 40 p.m eastern i started a room that said precoding train live stream chat because i was up here like plugging in things i thought anybody wants to come in ask a question offer a suggestion for the coding trains live stream maybe they'll uh pop in on clubhouse and say hello nobody joined not one person joined it sat there empty with just me for like five to ten minutes and then i very very sheepishly coward and clicked the leave quietly button i left my own room that i had started and sat in by myself for five minutes ten minutes quietly so anyway if um um um and kobe is um is uh offering some information in the chat about how to join um if you um once you reached a certain birthday okay so um i forgot the other thing so so what do i want to um oh and simon is pointing out that it is invite only ios only audio only yeah so you do need an invite you know if you want an invite i got a lot of invites such a clubhouse invite okay actually if you get a clubhouse invite from me it permanently says forever nominated by daniel schiffman so um that's probably why no enjoy i have invites okay okay okay uh anyway i thought you know i try to do i would like to do some more sort of like q a style stuff obviously i could do that on youtube itself um i could also we have a whole discord which has probably all the capabilities if not more of what clubhouse has but i the reason why i kind of got a little bit addicted to it is um there's a couple podcasts that i listened to that i'm a fan of and they were just having discussion rooms and i was joining them and like really excited and then there were some a lot of you know it's sort of like nft and crypto discussion all the time and i know nothing about that i mean part of me in a very very sort of like crude and uh selfish way sees the nft stuff and just starts to think oh could i sell like you know little like clips of coding train videos as nfts and then i'm like what is wrong with me and my like capitalist urges but um it's sort of interesting to follow at least what's happening in the art world and collecting our digital art in particular and nfcs and i know nothing about it so if you um if you know stuff about that want to come into the tony train discord and educate me i would love to hear all right so as now i think i've answered my own question why am i live streaming just to be here ramble talk engage with the community and work on tutorial adjacent projects um hopefully work on like nonsensical useless projects i actually let me just mention something speaking of clubhouse i wasn't gonna do this but now it's all connected let me go to um i should put this in a github repo so one of the podcasts that i listen to is called um i know you don't know idydk and to be honest i don't listen to every episode because it's about a television show called psych and i haven't watched the show yet and i keep thinking i'll watch it eventually and then listen to the episodes but i um uh the hosts were i have a sort of fun game that they play i guess in the tv show psych let me see if i can find this um you can start to see where i'm going with this um the tv show psych i believe there is a hidden pineapple in every episode and um they have a discussion on the show about uh on the on the podcast about where is the pineapple how pineapplyish is that particular image so i built a system using you know my knowledge i'm trying to use my knowledge of coding and algorithms of machine learning to make a difference in the world people and i thought what else could i possibly do to make a difference than make a pineapple detection web page system for a uh probably a podcast hopefully they're gonna have like a huge they're gonna get the coding train bump now and have thousands of listeners but they're a new podcast i'm assuming it's a small niche group you know i'm a niche this is a niche youtube channel i have all these subscribers but no one really watches the videos it's very interesting to me i mean lots of people do watch the videos don't get me wrong but just um um but uh i forgot what i was talking about anyway so i worked on this i'm gonna show it to you because maybe i can turn this into a github repo and take contributions for it i'll just go to this one which i think is the webcam version of it um you can see that i um did a lot of work with my web my web design skills to build this amazing website um uh are there psych fans i i hear by the way if you're a psych fan you're called a psycho right that's like you know like if you're a fan of is there a name for a coding train fan by the way like i guess you're a passenger no that's that's not i don't know you're a you're a choo choo ian oh and tarantu has just joined tarantu welcome to being you could be the one terence right now you could decide what is the name that fans of the coding train call themselves but i've got to reveal that i'm wearing sweatpants to get my random number book because um i most distinctly by the way i'm quite quite pineappleish if i don't say so myself uh terence your random number please write this down there's absolutely no other way we could ever possibly remember this ever like no computers or databases or anything near us that could possibly keep track of of random numbers assigned to viewers but your random number is on page 209 which is probably the page that i give everybody's random number which is what it opens to um and austin is saying it looks like a late 90s page yes that's the vibe i was going for um uh your random number on page 209 uh line 10 445 35 086 that is your random number so um what i did with this a particular this is a teachable machine trained model a pineapple is actually one of the categories in mobilenet there's 1 000 labels in the mobilenet machine learning image classification model that i use in a lot of coding tutorials and examples but using mobilenet on its own it wasn't really picking up pineapples unless they were you know prominently obviously a pineapple like right in front of the camera so i kind of trained my own model using uh images from um of pineapples as well as screenshots from the television show psych with pineapples placed in them like overlaid i wrote a processing sketch that loads snapshots of psychedel puts pineapples in them made date about i should just be doing this during my livestream it's such a fun project little did you know this is what i'm spending my evenings doing um and uh then took screenshots from the show that didn't have pineapples in them trained a model and now um we can see i know this was one of the things i was using to test fans karn is suggesting that fans of the coding train are unicorns or rainbows that could work um people in the chat i are saying please say my name and i really appreciate your enthusiasm and desire and i don't mind just like every once in a while reading one of them or maybe i shouldn't even say that but i would like to discourage people from asking that a chat sort of fills up the chat with a lot of extraneous messages and i will pull out and reference so you're more likely to have me say your name if i if you post a uh a wonderful little quip or suggestion or chat message there so let's try i know that it really like basically learned that yellow the pineapples are yellow you can see that i've made a yellow detector um i wonder if i just like take my hat off um how you know i've got a mushroom here oh come on can you hear that this is my new sound effect um yeah so anyway um i don't know that i should um do this right now maybe one of the um coding trade mods or github managers people i'm like making up titles for people but if you have access to make a new coding train repo i'll put this sketch into and actually the one the one that i probably should start with is not the webcam one this is meant to be used although there's no reason why i couldn't have it do both um pineapple uh pineapple detection system this is it yeah this is the one where you can drag and drop an image so if i were to look for an image let's actually look for a screenshot from psych um like uh let's use this this is this is this is definitely that um i'm using my time my live stream very wisely here we're gonna get to all sorts of productive important projects let's just uh let's let's confirm which i put on the desktop yeah let's drag this image in and we've got yes see no pineapple in that image now if i were to take that image and i were to then oh that's such a small little image and then i were to look for a pineapple and like paste it in and make it small like he's got pineapples on his shirt now okay i'm saving this let's see how this changes it let's see if my model works the way i expect point two two percent pineapple there we go 62 pineapple this is how i've been spending my time the thing is though i think i don't know how this is where i ended up in my life but i do get paid to teach actual college courses on this stuff and i i was working on this for the most part as a way to um um then i hope that this will be an example for my course in the fall it'll be fun you know the students will enjoy it they'll think i'm their really cool professor teacher person thing all right enough about pineapple ai please uh you just go to twitter twitter uh hashtag pioneer oh it's i forgot to say it's not pineapple ai it's um like if i go to twitter and go to uh hashtag uh pine a i pull its name is pineapple and i really actually just want to make a twitter bot that you can oh there we go good work everybody let's just show your please hold all right i broke my own rule which is not to be logged into my actual twitter account on a live stream but that's okay everything's okay uh you know it's just another day where nazi is trending on twitter thank you very much never opening up that trash website again oh my god all right back to back to today so let me actually try to um get um a little bit of a coding rail fan a rail fan is a fan of a train says arnov and profimesh is pointing out that my um green screen is 99 playable oh and david is a big fan of psych so david please oh yeah you can participate in this with me excellent uh the worlds can collide the uh weird entertainment podcasting world that i like to just listen in on from time to time um i have a whole other ai project that actually has quite uh not a large audience but a slightly larger audience than the pineapple ai that i'll bring to the coding train someday is there anybody here still watching no good we're we're uh this is a uh oh my goodness and guess who forgot to uh say thank you uh today's sponsor um brilliant uh brilliant is a wonderful a website where if you would like to learn in an interactive way everything you need to make a pineapple ai you actually could because they have a whole set of interactive courses that are stepbystep um quizzes and learning modules um that you can learn a whole variety of topics almost all of which are connected to things that they do here on the coding drain math and science and physics and coding and geometry and ai you can go to brilliant.org codingtrain you can actually sign up for free just signing up for free from that link shows them that you found it from me but if you want to unlock everything all the courses and everything at brilliant uh the first 200 subscribers will get 20 off so i'll come and i'm going to look at a course that i'm doing right now the course that i'm going through is one of the geometry ones and i'll come back and look at that a little bit more later um all right all right so one the one the first thing on my list today and this can be this is which is really important and maybe what i will do is just go to my rainbow topics um is that i have uh traditionally for however many years now maybe two or three um made a video a coding challenge for pi day and some of these maybe i've already done some of them maybe i didn't but i sort of i've kind of exhausted a lot of the things that i know about that kind of maybe would make sense for pi day um and it's also it comes at a bad time for me because ultimately you know if we're like pi day were in june although i guess i could do tau day and then i wasn't teaching and i had more time to like work on sort of speculative other topic videos but i don't want to let it go without a video this year and it there could be something actually quite relevant to um that comes out of like some of these recent videos that i've been doing about polar coordinates and simple harmonic motion and all that stuff but here i am it is just time for me to um and pratyush is saying that pineapple is my favorite fruit i actually don't really like refined up all that much let's see if anybody can guess my favorite fruit i'm not sure i really know what my favorite fruit is but if if we go back to the fruit that i used to always eat as a child there's a there's a famous story in my family i famously refused to eat at fast food restaurants was a child and uh um ate a bag of plums oh i just gave it away but i hate a bag of plums instead of the like and my family did not go to fast food restaurants very often but it was like on some sort of trip or something and everybody got horrible food poisoning and sick but not me because i only ate the plums um mango is a good one and also love the blueberry oh the blueberry is a wonderful fruit but yeah now you've all guessed plums because i already said although i don't know maybe um oh and austin tal day austin i haven't seen you in a while uh welcome back austin or maybe you've been around all this time and i just haven't noticed your name recently all right um so i need some ideas for pi day so this is a i don't i don't know how well this is going to work but um put them in the chat i'm going to um let's look for things that i've done already pi day coding train if i do this um so i did oh i did a version of a video based on three blue one browns um three blue one browns um video about the clacking what else to call it right now sorry i'm seeing a chat mask how about calculating pi the archimedean way one polygon touching a circle from inside another from the outside and the average length approaches the real circumference as they get more edges interesting i like this idea i did the first pi day challenge that i did was this one which is approximating um the value of pi with the dart throwing method what is the i'm not gonna be able to say this and i i do know this is just like not i mean i'm i'm familiar with this um it's just not fresh in my memory and i'm sure i spelled it archimedes way um finding pi by archimedes method official website approximating pi all right let's look at this you know what guess what everybody 13w net new york is my local station thank you very much not that i have any way of watching it but it is my local station okay around 250 bc up i have to sneeze okay please hold yes i am a very professional youtube host here who just shuts everything off to sneeze i had a box of kleenex the other day right here on the desk i don't know where it is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter well that's the definition of pi um so could i launch an interactive all right let's see what that is ah oh the um uh simon is pointing out the factors in common the chant and that i i know that um it was a long sneeze indeed i know why this interactive is not working so there i know what a channel that i'm a huge a fan of is stand up maths uh pi calculate dice rolling i mean i don't know if this is yep from a thousand random numbers this is what i'm thinking of here hi i'm matt parker and for pi day this year i am going to generate 1 000 random numbers using these two dice the first two of which are 31 and 27 so 31 and 27 do not share a factor in common well they share one the most pointless of all the factors but we're ignoring that right so we say they are this could be good because i need one of the projects that i have on my list today is to digitize and i don't actually have to do this because it already exists but i want to digitize the sequence of random numbers that are in this book so that i can always use it as my random number generator so that i could certainly do and then i would have to write some code that calculates the factors of every number and then determines if they are the same i guess i could like experiment with this right now so one of the things that i can do with my live streams is sort of um tinker around with an idea i got a haircut you can't tell i'm just wearing this hat but all of a sudden like there's like hair all over me um it's probably dog hair from gloria but um what i could do is uh um you know how do i what's an algorithm algorithm for determining the factors of a number uh so like stack overflow will tell us oh and um abe is pointing out that there's a new video that just came out from matt parker which is pi y pi to the pi to the pi to the pi could be an integer huh um it is not random if you get it from a repeatable source yes but there's a million of them i don't i could do i could calculate pi with all one million approximately pi with all one million numbers i love this idea so this is interesting but simon is telling me to check out euclid's algorithm is an efficient method for um computing the greatest common divisor of two integers the largest number that divides them both without a remainder okay this is excellent is an example of an algorithm which is a stepbystep procedure for performing a calculation according to welldefined rules this is one of the oldest okay i'm loving this idea so far so if i were to summarize this what am i not logged in okay hold on what what is going on give me a second here um oh i don't know there's a lot of stuff going on in clubhouse right now i might need to just turn this off and go listen to some interesting discussions um please hold oh my god what kind of crazy password is this sure why not whatever don't do anything you tell me to do all right i am back uh in the coding train topics repo and let's make a um by the way i find i find github's dark mode to be a little bit too dark for my taste i don't know why but i feel like i can't read the text um so uh all right yes um now uh pi day 20 21 uh euclids are like cofactors random numbers use all one million random numbers so 500 000 pairs um calculate the um is this what i'm looking for the greatest common divisor this is good actually this is one of the things i've been helping my kids with in their math class they're learning about how to reduce um fractions to their simplest form um and then so this is a good reference um ah where did i go ah no i closed it i'm the worst okay come on local storage thank you okay and now um this is a very mathy um i'd have to think about what what visuals might go with this but um um what visuals could go with this but and i'm not saying i'm definitely going to do this but here is an idea so if you can actually right now first of all you can reply to this thread if you have some suggestions or comments on this one if i've gotten this sort of wrong but you can right now file any issues here you won't be able to add the pi day label but i or another codingtrain github.org member will be able to do so i'm going to collect um lists of things and probably if pi day is march i need to record this video like next week so get them in get your suggestions in i would say buy monday if you can um all right um let's see anybody else got anything um that you want to share as an idea for pi day before i move on and one of the others like pie art looks like the art in pie yeah i mean i've done videos like this i'm not video i've done examples like this this is really nice i had this idea of graphing the um the distribution of random numbers of numbers in pi to see like if i do the first million like how evenly distributed is it these are lovely um i like seeing these um great work whoever made this visual cinnamon um a pie based rose yeah i mean i've made videos about the lisa's you curve and rose curves and all of these would be great to do i mean i could also do a coding challenge on a topic like this would likely i'd like like i want to do one that i haven't done before that just makes use of um polar coordinates or trigonometry and the number pi in some way that is like a celebration of pi day but not really like dealing with the number pi or its sequence of digits itself that's also something i'm crashing thunder is saying i like the idea of finding sequences or interesting information in the digits but guess what that's what i did last year so uh peaking inside pi coding train i'm pretty sure that was the video um that i did last year um right around the time of the start of the global pandemic uh march 14th 2020 and this was based on i assume it'll be linked from this page um this was based on the fathom uh fathom information designs project peek inside pie so i highly recommend that you check this out by the way i should be doing a better job of this but links that i'm looking at in the live stream i try to post those to the coding train discord under the live category under links so for example here's one that i'm just sharing and here's one that i'm just sharing so if you want to pick up these links um you know this is this youtube video that i just shared um um you can uh grab them there but more importantly boy did i forget to share the link to my pineai apple pineapple what if you use the sequences to make the rows more intricate so i could do a like a followup video that elaborates on the the rose curve um and makes some interesting variations of it i'm definitely i'm open to that idea oops i forgot that i don't have this disstream chat oh use the pendulum simulation so simon is saying um oh i don't have this here anyway okay sorry i messed this up bear with me for a second clearing out a chat thing use the pendulum simulation to calculate pi the formula for the period of a pendulum includes pi i think there might be um some issues with that in terms of how what my pendulum simulation actually does what if i could get i have an idea what if i could get a physical pendulum use computer vision to track the pendulums the bob of the pendulum's location and read its period based on millies and its physical location from the camera and then calculate pi that way that's a pretty interesting idea i would even try that right now if i because i have a bunch of cameras and things but i don't think i have a pendulum anywhere i suppose i could rig one up um but i like this idea oh ash okay ash hello hold on a second ash writes i'm learning coding on white hat jr i'm very curious one of the things that um uh i happen to look at from time to time is uh links that peop referral links to like the p5.js website and other kind of creative coding websites that i'm involved with um and um white hat jr is just like a uh uh site that i don't know if it's a massive site but it just throws a lot of traffic to p5.js or editor.pp5 the p5 web editor so i'm curious for anyone who's i don't know i'm not familiar with what white house jr is um but i'm curious for anybody who's a user of it to kind of let me know a little bit about it all right and uh simon is telling me that a i don't know why this is not working but i'm not going to worry about it that a 2.45 meter long pendulum will take pi seconds to complete a cycle so maybe i could measure exactly that length why i have like a nervous tic which is when i record videos or live stream i start to like sneeze or my nose gets itchy it's really like it's very strange remember that's a thing that happens to other people or it's just me all right i would like to share uh where we timewise 1 40 p.m i would like to share some projects from you the community of viewers of the code of dream that you have made that you have put your heart and soul into or at least a little bit of time into you took the time to watch your video play with the code make your own version so submit it to the codygrade website and i want to say thank you to you i love to see these and use them for inspiration and share them with students and all sorts of content so let's move on over to codytraining.com i'm gonna go to the challenger page um and i would like to so i have two methods by which that i look at community contributions one is i spin a wheel to pick a random one i have a just a random number generatory thingy that will pick a random one but i often also like to just look at because there's not that many of them uh community contributions to recent coding challenges so lucky for you if you so feel so inclined if you recently submitted a project to the spring force or the um and thank you for that comment prathamesh that you're sharing with me now that's good for me to know i was not aware the music was quite loud see i knew the music was too loud but i guess it's just different tracks of different volume but let me turn that back down now sorry everybody too loud too loud too loud yeah sorry about that um okay okay okay i got it i got it why is that why is it that that song is so loud hold on it's gonna be really quiet for a second try this again weird now it's like gone yeah okay i just wonder if i can can i do um q volume 50 percent all right so now so this is at the correct volume and now hopefully please mind your ears i have set that other track to 50 volume so it should be fine but there's a small chance i didn't do it correctly it's gonna be too loud here we go hopefully this is good all right sorry about that everybody all right let's look at um let's go to the pendulum first and let's take a look at some of these projects that people have submitted oh yeah this is great i'm so excited so i haven't seen all of these some of these will be new but some of them i have looked at already and i did look at this pendulum on a cart um project so this is super interesting to me because this is a simulation of the sort of pendulum flipped upside down and balanced on a cart and i forget if i can um oh yeah and it's i guess it's an algorithm for the cart to actually like balance itself but this is something that would be roger saying better yet no sound sorry i i have to have the sound it keeps me alive and full of energy it makes me feel like i'm not just alone in an attic in brooklyn new york talking to myself which is in many ways what i'm doing it's a little weird um what i was saying was um i've been looking for some examples for reinforcement style learning and so the sort of like cart balancing a poll type style example um is quite a good one and so maybe there's something i could do with this i have to admit i don't know too much about this particular algorithm it's pid controller um so i don't um like pid cart is a controller i don't know this terminology um but uh proportional integral derivative controller is a control loop mechanism employing feedback ah interesting i would love to explore this in a future video this would be i would love to be able to figure this out myself but not going to happen right now thank you for that wonderful contribution moving on i'm going to go to the colorful pendulum in codepen by andreyud chaka chakraborty there we go i love this we've got some nice um trails going a nice little beautiful red color picked for the pendulum um it'd be interesting to sort of time it and see if we could approximate the number of pi the number pi through this swinging pendulum um one thing that i was going to suggest for people for an exercise i think i might have forgotten to in the video is can you make it so that you can catch the pendulum and drag it around and then let it go um actually the nature of code example does have that code built into it that's something you might consider thank you i don't know why i have to press this thing twice every time why i don't think it's working correctly i was using it to replace this but thank you for this wonderful pendulum simulation okay next simple pendulum simulation using python and we've got a nice youtube video that is showing us the results here uh awesome this looks like that this particular simulation is using some real world measurements to simulate the path the oscillation of a pendulum in python i wonder if there is a code source code is linked here so we can see that here um on um on github itself cool whoa all right awesome um i'm not gonna go through this in a lot of detail right now but it's fun to see okay um next up we have got the up down left right by josh kenzer and this was by karen canary walla by the way the previous one up down left right whoa i have not seen this one yet um so one thing i should probably do this is a little bit unfortunate one thing that the um web editor doesn't do very smartly and i don't know the best way to handle it is if um if the editor is set to high contrast mode but the default sort of like text style is um black so it's very hard to read it let me just do show boxes so that says show boxes and show pendulum which is useful for me to just read out what it says anyway so i guess show pendulums is actually show the lines this is really this is this has the makings of a really nice perfect looping gif um i think there's that that i would really encourage you to think about as a way then you can nft it i don't know is that the thing i don't know how it works um i shouldn't just be so cavalier with my commentary um but uh you know bees and bombs is a um an artist that i'm a huge fan of who makes um among many other artists do this as well but makes uh um looping gifs out of uh simple and sometimes quite complex algorithms like this one but really nice choice of color and behavior in the way the pendulums all synchronize and meet up and create this geometric order and then separate out i love this quite a bit what does the slider do guess it's maybe like the speed or like a force oh or it's like some kind of alpha yeah oh the slider is the alpha yeah interesting that's pretty wild just to zoom in on this for a second that's quite beautiful the smearing of the color all right um bot bit just asked can you do gjk algo and run cutter which i'm probably saying incorrectly sometime i would i do want to explore those someday um i always just use sort of like simple euler integration which is a sort of fancy term for the way that i model motion in like p5.js animation programs and all the nature of code examples but i would like to explore some more sophisticated versions um okay now we've got a pendulum website by sarvogya singh what was that i love this little animation there's a little pendulum there my pendulums a simple pendulum a newton's cradle and a double pendulum oh this is so cool uh use arrow keys to make it move do i click on each of these oh and we get oh so i can like i can like apply a force to it with the arrow key that's pretty cool i love that i love that now let's look at the newton's cradle i would love this would be a great um this would be a lovely um coding challenge video uh see i feel like i want to like click and drag these press arrow key to start oh up whoa these are like little springy ones that's cool oh my god what have i done ah this is wild is this using um like a like a physics engine like mater.js or is this all yeah it's using matter.js so a matter.js is a physics engine that i use in in different examples of it previously but i haven't in a while this is great uh okay um let's look at the double pendulum just curious if this is a double pendulum also with matter.js can i click or is this just more um oops based on yeah this is also with mata.js cool wonderful thank you for sharing this okay now i know after that twice this is also way too quiet if i put it by the mic you can really hear it uh let us go now to um spring forces and see what we've got we've got three contributions here and i know that there have been other things that people have made i really would love for you to um submit them here because it's hard for me to pull up stuff from discord or twitter or whatever so i love for you to share your things that you make with me through other platforms but this is the central location to collect everything that i might look at on a given live stream okay grab any spring particle by galaton cool oh can i this is very similar visually at least to the example oh but i can grab any part of it oh that's wild so that's the change like i can just grab over here very springy so definitely some of the things i need to i should probably work on with my particular implementation is keeping things a little bit more um a little less chaotic uh all right thank you for that spring force contribution grasp by leonardo this one i have not seen oh cool so this looks like what it must be is it's just like my oh this is so oh oh this is really awesome so i'm just totally speculating here but i think what's being done here is this is literally my connected spring example it might not be but um um and so if you think about that soft string hanging down and you flipped it so that maybe this sort of like pseudogravity force is pointing upwards and then maybe there's like some forces some pearl and noise like forces pushing it left and right arbitrarily or just moving the top manually and all the sort of like springy connections are undulating and squiggling around and then even though this might be a sort of you know visualized in the literal way as like circle line circle line by having these strokes of of uh sequentially smaller widths um you really get this like seaweed underwater grass plant form like quality oh and abe is asking will you also take a look at the contributions of the noc series i actually wasn't planning that because i was thinking i'm sort of focused on just looking at the last two videos but um sure i would love to check out um particularly abbe if there was one of yours that you recently submitted that you want me to take a look at i would certainly or anybody else who's watching the chat that's submitted to those videos um please let me know i'm i almost don't want to look at the code because it's just so um beautiful on its own without even unpacking what's below it but i i can't resist so the grass looks like this is like what i did um with a very low k that seems to be something different um there's also a wind force which is new let's see and the wind is just a random amount every time that's interesting so because if the wind is small enough and it's random every time it's not going to like go crazy like this because it's just a little push in one way or the other so you randomly get a few pushes in one direction it'll start to go that way and it might slow back go back that's great um applying the force wind and this looks and i i think the secret here is just really thoughtful rendering um i don't know where that happens really thoughtful rendering and just clever tuning of the values and adding the wind obviously so let's look for where is the rendering happening i'm just curious uh grass update particle update spring show so that's in the show function of the spring and it has a stroke weight that stroke weight changes and is passed in during the loop ah this is such a very clever way of doing this so like this dot total minus i so if this if there's 10 springs the first one is thickness ten then nine then eight and seven etcetera etcetera um okay so simon has shared something for me to click on that um it was a collaboration between him and abe let me grab that real quick um and come back to it are we at break time yet yeah we're just about break time i gotta uh come i'm gonna take a break in a minute here whoa oh this is good it's like what kind of crazy insane code did you all write and i realized oh this is just the open simplex noise implementation okay let's run this lovely lovely lovely so we've got oscillating particles changes in colors actually something that i want to if if you'll end all indulge me for a second i want to explore something this reminds me of um so thank you for creating this um uh wonderful sketch i like how you're using a javascript object for like settings that's kind of like a cool little trick and i could also imagine you loading those from like a json file or something which you've got like a configuration for any particular visualization um but what i actually i if you'll all indulge me for a second i want to look at the video tutorial that i recorded on friday was about how to use an image texture in p5.js with a particle system to create a flame like effect and it was my expectation and let me do a dupe let me duplicate this and when i was trying to do this when i was recording the video itself that if i were to type webgl and use the webgl renderer i would see exactly the same thing would see exactly the same thing but maybe i would be able to get higher performance out of it even though this is a 2d system just to use the hardware acceleration of the webgl implementation in the browser itself when i ran this i see nothing and i see no error so i wanted to try to figure this out so let me just see i'm just gonna um comment out everything like where is the bug so first let me just draw that image yes so there's the image um and if i do sorry if i do background zero there that's the image now if i change this to webgl and i think i just figured out oh it's oh well that's a big issue oh that's all it is actually oh my goodness i'm such a let's say dumdum but this is i'm not because this is the mistake we all make and forget and do i forgot that the um point of origin in web gel renderer is the center so what if i just like do something which is probably not the best idea but just oh like hold on do this move it back okay great there we go so now i think oh is this i could have included this in the video maybe i will add an addendum to it um let's just see if this now works yeah but why am i not seeing the at the additive blending so why is blend mode ad in webgl i must need something different huh oh but this is good because this ran super super slow and let me just go for a second to the particle and just put the tint back to 255 just for a second so this is a smoky like effect and if i go back to the sketch um i'm getting some look at this later um if i go back to the sketch let me take out blend mode add okay so this ran really really slow so let me take out webgl it still looks kind of different so strange um um and let me i'm sorry i'm thinking here i'm also getting messages by reading direct messages on another platform so apologies for that um okay let's put back webgl no no this is what i want to do if i go and just comment this up what i wanted to look at is if i change emit to five you can see the frame rate here is now quite slow it's running quite slow oh the issue is maybe the clear okay i'll i'll investigate that i needed clear in with the additive blending not in webgl but that could be an issue so what i first thing i want to test is just if i add webgl here yeah so this is awesome super fast okay the webgl render is super fast now uh let me get oh i have the background on let's oh yeah are the clear on no that shouldn't matter uh hold on you know i want background let me take out clear for a second same thing now i'm in webgl you know why is it i think there's a z a layering issue also that the transparency that i have to consider yeah so this this i this i need to figure out like why i've got great performance but what's wrong with um what's wrong with the blending and i suppose a google search is probably not gonna uh 3d okay oh wait subtract so blend mode supposedly okay oh most of these only work no but these say 2d add should work with webgl according to the reference another thing to just make sure is that i am using yeah i'm using the newish version of p5 so i'm gonna have to investigate this more later i wanted to see if there was like a quick way that i could figure this out because i love the performance that i'm getting out of this now um add only works for 2d really all right let's try one of the ones that specifically says 3d uh like subtract so let's add let's try subtract well if i'm subtracting not getting anything is the issue there we go interesting oh hold on i think i have an idea oh look at that that's kind of cool if i'm subtracting i can do it that way and then do i and i don't even need the clear clear doesn't do anything does it so that's pretty interesting could i invert this now like watch could i use filter inverse or invert i don't know that that works in webgl no it cannot uh that's crazy fascinating so how why why why why is add i mean ad should really work so let me see uh webgl additive blending no i want really just the web gel so i wonder if i can like sort of break into the lower level webgl code and i would say this is a bug probably in um p5 yeah this to me feels like a bug but i'm glad to see this because this is pretty interesting to me now if i were to i think i can get some color out of this by going into the particle there we go kind of like that oh i forgot it's it's the opposite if i'm subtracting it's kind of interesting um well i'm pleased to see that i've gotten somewhere with this i think i should try to do uh investigate this further to see if there's actually a bug in p5 itself to me it feels like there is because how could how could add i mean broadly speaking forget about what p5 has chosen to implement or not um but broadly speaking um if you could do a kind of subtract blend in the web in in native webgl in the browser then there's no reason why the an ad blend wouldn't be possible and additive blending is also one of the most common techniques um in computer graphics in terms of creating fiery glowylike effects that i have a feeling this is um an error um austin is telling me to try screen okay and i'll have to change the background then to zero oh look at that screen interesting what is screen so now are you telling me that uh uh what i'm losing i've lost the alpha though or is it just that my numbers are so high or do i need the clear no i have clear the clear shouldn't really matter so why am i not getting like it's at the fade why am i not getting the this i wonder if i should actually use the texture um a 1 minus a times b this is pretty interesting though to see i mean this is kind of a nice effect also but it's not exactly what i'm looking for um oh profit mesh is asking about the live captions yes so i did an experiment where i was getting the live captions from a different service last week and i really liked it and i've been working on trying to get that directly into obs and i wasn't able to get it to work yet um so for today i'm just using the unfortunately the automated live captions from youtube those should be enabled um but um and if if um anybody's interested in helping me with getting um sort of the ape some sort of api working between i would love to connect offline about that because i would like to be able to get a better captioning service um enable alpha for the renderer yeah that is often true um okay all right i'm gonna move on from this because um i only have till three o'clock and i do wanna get to some other things that i want to do today i also need to take a minute to tell you about today's sponsor can i do a drum roll for the sponsor well i'm pressing buttons and getting things set up brilliant all right what is brilliant this is brilliant and maybe i'm going to take away this for a second this is the brilliant website it is a website i would say what i want to show you it's a website wow isn't that like such a brilliant characterization it's a website which is full of learning potential and possibilities if you like the content that i do on the coding train algorithms visualizations math physics the number pi geometry infinity ai and neural networks programming if you like all that stuff i think you might i think you would enjoy um uh brilliant brilliant is uh and the thing that i'm really trying to do with brilliant which is new is i'm trying to think of it as something that i can build into my daily or more likely here for me the way my life works weekly routine so i've set a goal for myself to try to do a lesson from a course one lesson every week let me just pull up here i want to make sure i had some other notes of things that i wanted to sort of say um say about brilliant just to make sure that i'm hitting all the um important points um you know i think for me one of the things that i as a teacher i'm really trying to find ways to inspire the love of learning and the fun of learning and so you know sometimes sort of often traditional ways of learning through kind of tests and memorization um don't can really um they're really kind of a downer in terms of getting that love of learning and so for me um making video tutorials playing around engaging with the community is one way and also having uh going through interactive lessons which have forms and discussions uh and lots of clever fun uh visual ways of and written ways of learning things that's really been uh really increased this sort of like fun and the other thing is there's a lot of topics here that i don't explore um cryptocurrency is one quantum computing is another so there's if you want to join me and a community of eight million learners and educators today um all you have to do is go to brilliant.org codingtrain um you can sign up for free just through that um but you also to unlock everything on the website um the first 200 subscribers uh to do so through that link will get 20 off so the course that i was doing um i don't know why it's not showing up to me here immediately i think i was was it beautiful geometry continue course yeah this is the one that i've been working on i think i'm on lesson two yeah so i'm on lesson two i've done lesson one already and my goal hopefully if you see me next week check with me am i on to lesson four do you guys hear that car alarm going off by the way that's always a lovely thing to happen why welcome to new york city people um so let's see i'm gonna like work through some of these problems the other thing about this to be perfectly honest for me one of the things i like about brilliant is i get lots of ideas for coding tutorials that i want to make um all right so what fraction of this large square has been shaded red okay well i can say that it's more than a quarter right because this is a quarter right here so this is oneeighth so a quarter plus an eighth plus a sixteenth so this is some kind of sequence that i guess when it goes to infinity going to infinity add in add infinitive is latin meaning to infinity it's approaching what and so these lessons here um simon is telling us an avid brilliant user i know is telling me that these lessons are called quizzes thank you um so what is this approach um and i guess i could just like use p5 first i could use a calculator but if i were to say like in p5 for a second um like if i were to say like 4 let i equal 0 i is less than like 100 i plus plus i'm going to start with the sum which is 0.25 sum plus plus equal itself uh divided by two right divided by four oh that wasn't oneeighth yeah it is no no times two oh i'm sorry if that's one let me look back at this this is 1 4 that's 1 16 1 16 that is not 1 8 that's 1 16 because it's 1 fourth of onefourth onesixteenth so that was right i said that wrong sum uh divided by four and console log if i do that a hundred times what do i get and oh no i don't want to add the whole okay hold on some okay i need a start is i don't think i'm gonna get through this whole lesson today oh and you can't see my code oh i'm the worst um sorry about that everybody let me move this over good thing it was it's okay my code was like terrible anyway because it wasn't right so what i'm doing is i have a sum i'm starting with zero sum plus equal and i'm just going to say value sum plus equal that value then value times equals a quarter and then keep adding it together and together together let's just do that 100 times so stand in for infinity aha point three three three three three three one third i don't have the chat open anymore so people were probably yelling at me yeah onethird plus onefourth to the power of number and range this is a geometric series okay um austin's right on every scale the red square is onethird of the blue squares that's um okay that's actually a great way of thinking about it that totally makes sense um so let me go back to the brilliant website i'm gonna confidently click one third i'm gonna hit submit i got this right 52 by the way i want to let you know that i get this stuff wrong i don't know what i was gonna say at least a quarter of the time if not more and so to me uh the and i also love the feedback it gives me when i get it wrong because um it's like very positive and affirming and i think like that's part of the learning process is getting it wrong and then i always every time i click on these explanations because i like to see what it says the figure can be thought of as a series of progressively smaller up and down l shapes each one with a dimension half of that of the previous one each individual shape has one red square and two blue squares for a total of three squares so the red makes up one third of each l shape so that would have been a that's an austin in the chat said that that would have been a great way um to think about it for e day next year says braden you should calculate e what day would e day be february something um i wish i could say that it hadn't been several years since i touched a geometric series so this could be actually an approach that i take a geometric series to cut i think oh i did this one i did the geometric series for calculating pi which what was that one called um liebnet's formula yeah i did that on the coding train coding train so this is one i did another year the leibniz formula is a method for approximating pi so um wonderful all right and austin just saw it intuitively which is always great to hear okay i i would like to uh so i'm gonna um you know keep me honest here folks tweet at me message me at the discord let me know did i finish my lesson two later today i'm gonna go through and finish this on my own my goal i'm trying to have a goal of doing one more lesson per week i feel like if i can get through all the courses on brilliant by doing one one lesson or one quiz per week that i'll have had a lot of new ideas and things to be teaching and doing on the coding train um just to mention a couple other courses um if you want to learn python there's a whole course programming with python which is an interactive code editor that's one that i've spent some time with that's really terrific and then a good companion piece to the coding train um is also this neural networks and ai oh just this this course about neural networks on the brilliant website so thank you so much to brilliant for sponsoring these live streams really helps keep the the um the engines running here on the coding train um i really do appreciate it i'm gonna take a short break and if you haven't signed up for brilliant during this break i would highly encourage you to head to brilliant.org codingtrain and i will be back in hopefully less than five minutes do just want to briefly drop in to acknowledge the message from whooshbot thank you so much i happen to be taking a break but i see your wonderful a kind message and the enthusiasm of viewers like you is really what keeps me going so thank you so much do do do do do all right coming back in just a few minutes uh i'm not a few minutes sorry just like 30 seconds sorry do all right you know it really requires a lot of energy to come to these but i'm enjoying this i had a lot of energy at the start and i'm starting to fade but i do have some a sort of like and i feel like i also feel like in a way this is like what i want the live streams to be which is just a hangout session um i think maybe it's actually a little less appealing to some of the audience who would much rather just see me like working on like building tetris basically in a twohour live stream which that kind of thing gets requested a lot and i do aspire to do it actually tetris and funny to mention that is something that i really have high on my list now of um i don't know if that should be like a multipart coding series or just something i do in the live stream but um i don't know so your feedback is welcome how to make you know my focus right now is really on the tutorial videos that i'm doing um and then i think i will pivot hopefully come around um april or may um to being able to do some other content but um if you have sort of thoughts or feedback about what uh what you like about the videos i release versus the live streams and how to um you know um how it's all feeling for you um it'd be great to hear i mean it's interesting i have finally now separated the live streams from the produced sequence tutorials and coding challenge videos so before it was all the same thing where i would my live stream was really just a live stream of my recording session now i do those recording sessions i still do actually stream those for members to sort of like tune into to like help give me feedback but they're much more of like actual recording session with no community segments um and um jodhwat says plan the comment i see in the chat is a plan and yeah so i'm often wondering do i need more of a plan so anyway your feedback is welcome i'm not gonna be doing that much live streaming to be perfectly honest in the next couple months um there's gonna be two more hopefully in march one or two more in march one will be with a guest um and then and then i'm just taking a few weeks off and alex subscribe to brilliant that's so nice glad to hear all right um i've lost the live the coding train member chat there it is i've got it back um is this the end already guess what it's not i'm off to do one more thing and i had a kind of longer list of but oh just as a reminder if you have um ideas for and thank you to brilliant for the sponsorship um if you have ideas for pi day videos please post those in discord or in the github repo someone can maybe share that um the night sky writes longer beard should make the audience focus better interesting interesting there's there by the way there's like a period of time somewhere in the sort of like um you know beginning of quarantine we're still really in quarantine here um where my beard had gotten i never have gotten that long i saw a i saw like an image of me from one of those live streams and i was like shocked because it didn't seem that crazy to me at the time but like whoa it had gotten really crazy um all right so here's the thing that i need to do i need is some sort of interesting word choice of mine there i mean i i don't know really why i need to do this but um i'm going to go here so all you you know if you've been a coding trained viewer for a while or even recently for a short while that i have an obsession with this book a million random digits with a hundred thousand normal normal deviates i'm still looking for an original print of this book that is fully intact with every page it will be my prized possession if i can ever track down a copy um um but um anyway i have this version and i and i'm i'm working on this project where i'm laser etching and i really should bring the strain whistle that has the actual test laser etch on it laser etching a random walk pattern onto train whistles and sending them as gifts to members of the coding train um and i don't know austin is that question for me because definitely doing more server side stuff recently and i often get the feedback people like why are you doing all this database and blah blah blah stuff um um so i'm reading the chat the same time while i'm talking so i think for the authenticity the total and pure beautiful authenticity of these train whistles and for other things that i want to do like perhaps this pi day video i would like to have access to the random number sequence of 100 million digits that is in this book in a i don't know what what i should put in a json file a text file a binary file i'll make a whole web api i'm not sure but so but let me download some of these data file well this is actually all i want i spent a lot of time talking about this oh only to reveal that here it is exactly what i need the 1 million the table of random digits in plain form so what's in these other ones this is in pdf anyway i'm just going to download this one let us open it up let me open it in um just put it on the desktop here and go to terminal what's it called digits.txt and there we go oh interesting this is actually in the file so i'm gonna have to do some parsing of this so the other thing about this right now i remember why i want to do this because i ultimately i have space by the way for one million that'll be i don't know what i'm going to do if i ever have one million people join as a member of the coding train but they're one million spots basically right i would like to produce all one million of these terrain whistles eventually oh oh that could be kind of awesome okay what if like everyone was unique okay this is cool this is cool okay totally i love this i love this okay so first things first let's just do an exploratory session for a moment where um i am going to load this into the discord bot that i've been working on like ultimately in some sense i want to make this a separate project like the random number sequence api project or member coding train member database project but let's wrap it into the discord bot for a second so i'm going to go to very convenient and i know that i said i was going to look at the live poll today sorry about that i'm the worst um i'm the worst okay so i'm in the image generation i can't remember where i left this off maybe somebody can remember discord bot choo choo um all right did i merge this branch pull request oh oh i've had some oh this is the image generation so why didn't i merge this i don't know i see no reason not to i'm about working this branch a little bit longer so i'm sort of remember i'm gonna go to glitch for a second where i actually have the bot and my very very clever and super amazing way of disabling the bot is to comment out the code so this is the actual deployment of choo choo bot which is running on glitch i should probably i love glitch and i think it makes sense for a lot of things that i do but maybe the discord bot actually should be deployed somewhere else um so now if i let's just see if i'm in the right place here um if i run it what oh i forgot i was trying to i forgot that i was in a speculative place oh right and fun planet showed me how to do this i never follow up on this stuff i'm the worst i gotta get to the summer where i don't have like other work i have to do all week in between live streams and i can like follow up and remember what i've done so hold on hold on everybody uh let me let me open up this pro i'm gonna get there if you will just be patient with me um i'm going to go to generate.js and remove require p5 which is all i need to do i think actually i think i just left that in there there we go great so now i think if i go to um discord is this only i don't did i remove the idea of it running only in one channel um so where's my commands.js no but let me take that out um so i'm just going to use my a channel where only i have permission in i think we'll see if this works so i'm going to discord and i'm just going to use this channel like if i do this command i don't have the permissions all right can somebody please oh fun planet there you are you're watching oh fun planet thank you so much for all of those i really like fallen was so excited about that i was like i want to make actually and i would love to collaborate on this or if you just want to like go for it i will really support and champion you but i wanted to make a lot node library that was not that was like a node p5 library that allowed you to do p5 in node but didn't actually have um well either had that didn't have i don't know how to best do this i didn't want to like change the p5 code itself i want this to be a wrapper of some additional code so that as the p5 library grows and changes over time it can always just stay in sync with it but we're not um so that's that's kind of my my plan so um did i vamp long enough is there somebody who's a mod here um who can um who can fix the um and maybe i'll just do it myself i'm going to try to fix the permissions of the bot testing channel um so how do i do that um channel edit channel permissions advanced permissions is what i want um everyone see i don't know how to do this quickly i'm gonna make everyone not be able to send messages i think this is fine i think that might have been enough somebody can hopefully fix it for me but i'm back so i'm in this channel which should have the bot going and that was running right from here uh did i call it generate was it random walk oh yeah there we go great i don't see any console logging happens which makes me nervous like like i don't i seriously don't have like a console log uh it's just okay okay great i'm in the right code my bot is running so this is what i sorry for that i've got i've got 20 minutes here to do um uh to do about what i want to do so i'm going to take this file digits.dxt txt i am going to put it into uh discord bot choo choo commands um the question is where to store it let's just store it here in the root directory for right now is this by the way are these tabs i'm not sure and then um let's go to uh the code i can close this so i've got the digits here now in this command i do want the file system and i want to say uh digits equals or i'm just going to say raw digits equals file system read file sync how do i do this like something like this if i want to go back one directory i should know this kind of stuff and then and then i want to say utf8 okay so i'm loading the raw digits i need a little bit more room for the code here then um let's just see if that works okay that worked so there's all the raw digits now i need to um now i need to chop this up to make it an array of all the digits but i need to so i guess like like what if i do split and i split it by a regular expression which is just any white space let's see what i got okay great so then how do i get rid of all of the row numbers which i don't need so if there are in the digits file one two three four five six seven eight nine ten so every so 0 9 i'm sorry 0 10 20 if the index modulus 10 is 0. so should i use filter i'll call it randoms digits filter is there like can i in the filter function can i get an index so i want to filter out or is this or is this all that i want to keep so i'm using this higher order javascript function i thought i have no idea if this will work to basically filter out everything um oh i could split with the line break says arnab that's a smart idea so but let's see if this works this i want to filter out every tenth element um let's see if this works i also could use the spaces between the row number and the data yeah there's lots of other ways i could do this uh did that work doesn't seem like it yes does not does not equal zero well hold on oh i had console log digits still in there so maybe that did work or if it did it did the hold on i think that might have hold up console.log randoms.length 000 that is not right 22 000 interesting i wonder if as i'm filtering it if the all right let's split it up let's let's do it um let's do rows by rows and i can concat all right let's try this okay that kind of seems right right okay so now what if i uh rows so for every row of rows digits equals rho dot split by any number of spaces and then uh splice the first one out there's 11 index modulus 11 there's 11. one two three four five six seven eight nine ten oh but because the number is there it's eleven oh so that would have totally worked okay let's go back i i don't know i couldn't like my brain couldn't make that happen uh um hold on i'm gonna keep this because i like what i'm uh people were saying that to me in the chat and i was not i was just like what that's weird that's not right i just like completely ignored it but i just see it uh thank you arnov for like being very clear about that let's okay so this should be and i just want to save this other way that i was trying it so let's see if this gets it to me uh oh digits should be an s oops i've kind of missed some things here there we go hundred thousand twenty thousand and one that's weird does um a line break not count as white space it's definitely not equals did i download the wrong file did i download the wrong file why are there only why are there 220 0001 numbers and not 1 million hmm all right hold on let's go back to my rows splitting for a second do i i don't need a g there with split do i for global uh oh i hear my i have a feeling cooking class bacon class has ended it's digits not numbs so weird okay hold on let me let me go back to my more manual way of doing this 20 000 yeah it's a million digits it's never been a million numbers i've been wrong this whole time my whole life i've completely misunderstood this book and i never bothered to check is this about this i'm so confused i got hold on a sec there are 200 000 numbers all this time i could have read this my whole life is alive this whole time i only had to there's only i've i've been thinking there's a million random numbers in this book there's only 200 000 which is fine that makes my life easier thank you very much and you need your stupid 1 million numbers anyway does he probably say this right in the introduction um am i supposed to think of this as random numbers zero through nine the random numbers in this book were produced by a rerandomization of a basic table generated by an electronic roulette wheel should but how should i be thinking of this should i be thinking of the book as a million i could by the way i could only take 200 000 members now of the coding trade i can no longer have one million members i got to re i read the whole introduction but like years ago and i i obviously didn't retain what's in it and i don't think i could just reasonably read it right now um so the question is there are 200 000 i'm going to still consider them five digit numbers so for the sake of argument right now i'm going to consider them five digit numbers um and only um yeah because i want to have i want to have 200 000 unique are they unique or all well let's find out i need to find i need to know right now if all the numbers are unique all the five digit numbers are unique no well no they can't be they can't be unique they are bunched up in fives but you can choose any number of the digits to form your own random numbers as big or small as like that is the idea but how do i use them grouping random digits zero to nine into groups of five does give you random numbers zero to ninety nine thousand nine hundred ninety nine i guess yeah can you see if any of the random numbers begin with one or more zeros they do they do they absolutely do um chris writes i was going to join the channel but now that seems like rubbing it in right there's no way that they're unique but they're not unique how many unique ones are there and so if you get a random number you get it all over the book all right we're gonna keep them we're gonna keep them as five i mean i'm gonna make a just sort of executive decision right now good news is my algorithm here is correct this should give me two hundred thousand five digit numbers two hundred thousand perfect so now i would like to sort this array um so let's do i forg always forget does sorting the array actually change the array i think it does random sort um oh this is more than i have time for right now okay so i've sorted them so is every number there is one question and um yes every number there i need to do like a array to set what if you convert array to set oh that's an interesting idea i was going to manually filter them myself like into groups and every number is not there right if if zero is there four times by definition that means there's not enough space for every number pigeonhole principle i've heard this term before pigeonhole principle yeah yeah ten pigeon nine whole since 10 is greater than nine at least one whole lot of set is actually a good idea okay uh javascript set i wanted to count how many each was in there but that's overkill for right now uh so if somebody's random oh that's why the column and row the index of the random number is actually important that's going to affect okay so there's still 200 000 spots if the idea is that you're getting a spot in the sequence even if you have the same random number now i should try to give people unique random numbers but if the idea is that you're getting your random walk it's going to be 200 000 iterations you're getting all okay okay so i'm actually not going to worry about this right now just for a moment that will come later what i want to do is um so i'll come back to all this and probably be worth making it actually be worth totally making an api oh here's a project for us as a coding trained community let's make an api which has the raw text of the sequence and then you can ask it for like give me um one million numbers random numbers zero through nine give me uh 500 000 numbers zero through 19 basically um so um so that would be that's a great that's another project but let me just follow this through a little bit more so um so i'm going to call this random s which is the strings and then randoms equals random s map parse int elt so this should give it to me as actual numbers okay so now i've got them as actual numbers and there's 200 000 of them and what i want to do is i want the argument of the message i want to give it a seed so if args dot length is greater than zero so let's have let seed equal random math math.random times randoms.length and floor that then if args.length is greater than zero then seed equals um parseint args index zero you know i should check if it um i'll add it to do here to do uh check that argument is valid number between zero and um right 199 999 right then i'm going to call generate image seed so we're going to get the seed here we're not going to do it a million times i start to zero i is less than randoms.length and then the number r is random randoms index i plus seed modulusrandoms.length is that right let me put that in a separate variable index equals i plus the seed modulusrandoms.length so this this should pull and then this should be that number modulus 4. so this should take the seat from from any it's not actually the seed value i should not call it seed right now because i might want to use it as a seed eventually but this is really starting index is really what this is and i'll just call it offset because it's really the offset i plus offset so the idea being that i'm going to always produce the same exact random number pattern um by starting at a certain number in the sequence of 200 000 numbers and then iterating over all of them from there and ultimately i could go through it twice or something but let's see what this let's see what this gives me all right so let's go to discord type generate let's see what i go oh it should tell me the shoot so i want it also to return um return the buffer and also let me do this again um so the attachment is so this is um then i can also say buffer dot index here's your random walk starting at index right that should let me just make sure do this work oh why'd i get an error there let's see what happens i did get an error oh we got an error let's see random is not defined where ah randoms.length this is a terrible name for a variable by the way randoms terrible name for a variable but let's see if this works let's just make sure the bot is live by the way i hate that this is called generate it should be called let me rename it now the now is not the time i want to change the command to random walk or something generate at undefined good work everybody here's your random walk starting at undefined why is that undefined uh return buffer oh it's called offset well no wonder i can't just make up a variable name here okay um i mean i guess i know what it is because i have it here so this is silly for me to get it back oh yeah i don't need to get it back it's picked here what am i doing i mean it's good it's like now i'm making sure it's right but um that was silly let's just do that okay here we go generate it got an error the resource must be a string buffer or val oh oh i'm still doing this though took it out of here no what am i doing where am i okay oh hold on i'm getting some messages breaking news here uhoh things aren't good downstairs in baking class i've gotta go okay 8063 so here here is the real test ah that is so good who's who just joined what was terence's random number who joined uh i'm still returning yeah oh no you're behind me chat you're behind i already fixed that um let's just generate zero generate zero beautiful all right this is good we're getting the unique pattern for any given number in the sequence of 200 000 numbers yes now if i wanted to have it be one million numbers i really could because um because i only have four options for the random walker so i guess i can make that decision later but i want to just change a couple of things one is first i don't need to do this console log anymore um loading sequence of random numbers i so that's done i also want to change this command to rename i'm going to call this random walk and update imports for random walk i don't know sure yes um what does that do oh random walk random walk okay i think that actually should be all that i need to do to change it i should probably put this back to only being in the bot testing channel because that's sort of the point of this particular bot and now hello oh it's it's running um choo choo now generate should give me nothing except it gives me an error because i don't have any error handling it's just the words i thought i added error handling maybe there's a pull request for it generate so now i should be able to say random walk it'll give me a random one so the idea also could be that it would look up in the database my random number and give me that one or i could request a specific one um by and this should still be the same this is still the same image as this one right so we're in good shape now um there also was a pull request i saw that somebody did wrap around so that it would sort of like also come maybe over here if it was going up to the top so maybe i should add that as well but this is good i'm going to say uh get an ad adding the random digits sequence from book um i am um finishing up by the way this is it this is the end of today's live stream i'm gonna deploy this uh hopefully i'm gonna um throw caution to the wind and find the github repo uh for this particular pull request which is now got this i'm going to merge it i'm going to cancel it uh here it's not running then i'm going to go do my ridiculous way on glitch of whoops of of making the bot run so i'm going to go to tools import and export and by the way i'm never supposed to i should not be showing this but i think there's enough characters that are covered up i suppose somebody could probably now check all the possibilities and eventually get it good luck to you i'll just have to uh delete and recreate this project or something um but that's sort of a problem that that just shows up here and now i'm going to do this and then uh it should be running now hold on oh it's still like installing some stuff okay great hi code guppy thank you very kind wait did the 8063 look the same it's similar it's very similar it's a very similar the sequence is always the same you have to remember that it's just where you start so the patterns are actually going to be quite like like if i now if i say random walk one like how different is this going to be pretty pretty pretty similar i can't even tell the difference at all so is that a problem it kind of is but i think that there's still two hundred thousand like if i do one hundred thousand i think it's going to be pretty diff oh sorry random walk so um maybe there's a better way to do this to have them all be more unique um but you can see that they are there are this one is quite different 8063 is not that far away from zero considering touring papa the sun is out oh my goodness it is 3 p.m the sun is out i think it's over 50 degrees fahrenheit here um code guppy you are much too kind these donations are very very appreciated but definitely unnecessary um it is going well thank you for the super stickers and i am going to say goodbye so i got some stuff accomplished today please share with me your oh oh am i blowing everybody's ears out how's the volume of that song right now let me know before i keep playing it um um skip digits different like there's all sorts of ways i could vary this but that's kind of not the point right the point is we're all getting a random walk according to the book slight variations um but it sounds like i am being called away so um i'm just gonna like lower the volume to be safe down here uh are the blondies ready okay but i should stop now huh i'm still i'm currently live streaming but i'm i'm wrapping up all right um it is beautiful outside nice and sunny in michigan are we gonna go out to the park no i'm reading the chat somebody from michigan wrote a nice message in the chat it's we're not in michigan we're in brooklyn all right um my children are here they gave they were kind enough to allow me these two hours of live streaming with you it's actually been about two hours and 10 minutes i'm gonna let this um yeah osama is saying look for a json file with a random one million numbers i could find that that's not the point the point is this is the book the coding trade bible so to speak if you will um this is our text our you know if um hopefully i'm not like by accident starting some sort of strange um cult here go to trade cult but this is this is the core text so i want to tie everything to this book um just for fun thank you austin oh yes for reminding me to thank brilliant um the sponsor push to get it is pushed um i'm also gonna um unlock the bot testing channel and let me do that um let me go to here and go to permissions and go to advanced and back to everyone being able to send messages save changes and i'm going to leave and now you should be able to work with the bot yourself in the discord codingtrain.com discord link in the chat that i just posted as well um thank you for telling me it was a fun stream jiao dat i appreciate that i can't hear the music at all can you um and stay tuned uh there's a selfavoiding walk coding challenge that needs to come out there are four chapter four of nature of code videos that are on their way i have a little short five minute video about a template literal in javascript that i have not seemed to manage to produce that has a theme song so that's coming out soon and um i will see you all maybe so the next live stream i mean just check you know subscribe all that nonsense stuff um you know i will say that i'm pretty low and i look let me pause for a second when i look at my stats i could i would pull them up if i felt confident how to do that it shows me how many people who have subscribed have notifications on and that how and also as a percentage how many people have notifications on as well as all notifications on for my channel i really low like i have a very large number of subscribers but a really low percentage of people with the notifications on so if you don't know about that fee i'm not asking you to turn those notifications on if you don't want to get them i don't want to spam people but if you're not aware of that feature um i would encourage you to go and do that right now in terms of that will give you certainly like when i schedule a live stream that will then show up as a notification when i am live streaming and then of course when new videos are posted as well so a little bit of plug for myself um you know ring the bell hit that bell whatever i mean but but i i i find that the whole like you know it's just noise at this point if you're watching a video and somebody says don't forget to subscribe and click that bell it's just like it's everywhere so you know i i want to be like conscientious about asking you to do things but i do think there might be a little bit of a disconnect where a lot of the viewers either maybe rightfully so don't don't want they want notification and this could make sense actually like maybe you only want notifications from a youtube channel that does like once a month high quality video 10 minutes long well produced uh you really just want to make sure you watch their monthly 10minute video whereas a coding channel might have weekly live streams tutorials popping up every few days and it's just a mess of notifications for you but so i'm going to stop talking about all of that um and just thank all of you uh for being here today there's about 10 seconds left in this song and i will see you i'm join the discord i'm gonna leave this chat will be open for a little bit because i'll play some outro music so if you're not sure about how to join the discord how to engage with the community how to get your notifications turned on how to join as a member all that stuff you can ask it in the chat all right and i will see you all next time on the coding train as always i always forget that this dot these p5.js hearts oh my goodness i uh i knocked over the music as always these p5.js dots are a symbol of my love for you the viewers of the coding train for all the people of the world coders and noncoders alike i see i spy through the window there a beautiful sunny day i don't know what the weather is like might be the middle of the night for you but take some time away from your screens from your computers from your coding if you can it's hard to be with people these days but you can be with sunshine or nature or fresh air or a book stumble up with a book a painting of drawing something um find that for yourself at least today thank you to brilliance who is the sponsor and certainly uh when after you've taken your break from the computer uh i just stopped talking goodbye i can't find the button to take me out of here i found it now never forget this dot somebody composed that song for me i'm gonna say once again here we go sing it with me it's the forward new cartesian coordinate song it's the forward to cartesian coordination autotune and the internet will fix that for me sing it with me it's the polaroid i noticed people by the way in the chat are talking about the weather where they are which i'm enjoying seeing as i'm kind of like cleaning up and getting things turned off here um uh and i forgot to do this beginning i like to give a prompt and have everybody sort of answer the prompt in the chat and one of the ones i usually do is just like where are you where are you right now and i don't mean like give me your latitude of longitude but like what country what city are you from um and chris sears just joined chris sears you waited you waited until the very last moment but yeah you know you will get a random number i had to come back to give you your very own random number chris sears whose name i see quite often in the chat and i'm glad to maybe see your profile photo and see you in the discord uh we're going to give you on page 96 row 4770 column one eighty eight thousand two eight eight two two seven eight eight i'm gonna think of these as sequences of five digits now eight eight two two seven so the important thing is your index right your index is and we should be able to figure this out because it's ten for if you're in row four seven seven zero column index one it's the second column zero one that's where you are that's the important thing um and i'm seeing where people are from in the chat um i i love that and i am going back to the last song and here it comes unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows i i see chris that we're trying to fly on the red it's a great message so i have lights that blink when somebody joins it's very obvious to me games i feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this is a this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it i'm really getting to something i need my sound effects what else is analysis things that i will use continuously over and over again first thing i need to do is and kittens kittens yes kittens and kittens and kittens kittens the kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens the kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens the kittens and kittens
