00:00 - (bell dings)
00:01 - - Okay, so, I have a
whole playlist of videos
00:03 - about Git and GitHub if you haven't,
00:06 - if you don't know anything
about Git and GitHub
00:09 - you might want to go and
look at some of those
00:10 - as we'll assume basic knowledge.
00:12 - What I'm going to show you is,
00:14 - if you're on a new machine,
00:15 - hopefully you might have
set this up already,
00:16 - but what if right now, for the first time,
00:18 - you are using Git from the command line
00:22 - and you also want to work with GitHub.
00:24 - So I've actually already installed Git.
00:26 - I can see that,
00:27 - because I can type Git and it
shows me a bunch of things,
00:30 - it doesn't say Git is unknown,
00:31 - but if you need to install Git,
00:33 - you can just go to git-sem
00:36 - and download the latest version for your
00:38 - operating system and then back here.
00:41 - I got all this crazy stuff
open, let me close it.
00:44 - I can start doing git commands,
00:46 - like for example, if I make a directory,
00:49 - that's make a directory, like new project
00:52 - and I do cd new project and I say git init
00:56 - that's how it actually
makes a git repository
00:59 - inside of a folder.
01:00 - Oh, look at this, all
of the sudden it says
01:03 - look, git and master
and I can do things like
01:06 - git branch and somethings I don't like to
01:09 - use the word master, I just
use source or something
01:12 - so I can say git branch source.
01:16 - Okay actually, I haven't
made any files, so it's not
01:21 - going to let me make a the branch without
01:23 - any files, so let me show
you, this is a bit out
01:25 - of scope but it's fine actually because
01:27 - we can tie some things
together, like for example
01:29 - I'm going to say code dot.
01:30 - It will open up this directory with Visual
01:32 - Studio Code, then I'm
going to make a new file
01:35 - and I'm going to call it
01:39 - sketch dot js because I'm
01:41 - working on some Java script code.
01:43 - I'm just going to put
function setup in it and
01:46 - hit save and look at this
when I come back here
01:53 - you can see now that the file is in there,
01:55 - and look at this actually this changed
01:57 - I think this is indicating something to me
01:59 - like there's a new file or something.
02:01 - So now I want to say git commit but
02:03 - guess what, who's making that commit.
02:06 - I haven't actually configured
my, if I'm working with
02:09 - git locally on my machine,
I actually need to
02:12 - configure who I am.
02:13 - One thing I can do is, is
type git config dash list
02:16 - I believe, and this is
all the various settings
02:19 - of things that are like set up
02:21 - I don't really care about that,
02:23 - I just hit Q to get out of that.
02:25 - What I need to do, and I'm just going
02:27 - to look this up with
git config user dot name
02:32 - or user email, or user name
02:35 - and this can be my name or
whatever name I want to use.
02:38 - You should probably tie
this to your GitHub account.
02:41 - Oh no it needs to be global,
git config user name,
02:44 - I want it to be global, I
think if I do dash dash global
02:50 - then I can say git
config user dot email and
02:53 - Daniel at the coding train dot com
02:56 - dash dash global.
02:59 - So this now, I've now
set up git by the way.
03:03 - If it's a fresh install you're going to
03:04 - want to do this, with my information and
03:06 - then I can do things
like, I can say git status
03:11 - and this is like the new untracked file
03:14 - so I can say git add sketch dot js
03:17 - and then I can commit it and maybe
03:20 - what I want to do is say.
03:23 - You know most people would just do this
03:25 - git commit dash M for a short message
03:29 - like make a new file and I could do that
03:31 - but I'm being very long
winded in this video
03:33 - so what I'm actually going to do
03:35 - is configure my editor.
03:38 - So what I'm going to look for is configure
03:41 - code editor with git or associate, I think
03:45 - is the word I'm looking for, associate.
03:48 - If I come here, basically
this is what I need
03:52 - git config dash dash global core.
03:55 - I want this and I'm using code
03:59 - and I think it's good like
04:00 - to put this dash dash wait, meaning
04:03 - it will wait for you to
finish and now if I say
04:06 - just git commit, it opened up this thing
04:10 - in my editor, which I can
now write my commit message.
04:14 - New file and I can
write my longer one like
04:16 - dear diary,
04:19 - I don't know what I am doing with my
04:21 - life,
04:23 - all the best, sheefmahn.
04:28 - Alright and then once I
close it, back here it's
04:31 - done that and I don't know why I'm talking
04:34 - about git branches but I can say
04:35 - git branch source
04:38 - and that made a new branch
04:39 - like I can say git branch
and it will list me
04:45 - and I can hit Q to get out of that.
04:46 - Git branch dash V, it's showing me more
04:50 - information and I can say git checkout
04:54 - source and now I'm in the source branch.
04:56 - This is so useful if you
know again, if you're new
04:59 - to git you might not realize this but
05:01 - know which branch you're in all the time,
05:04 - having that reminder is incredibly useful.
05:06 - I should also mention if I go back into
05:08 - Visual Studio Code and I do
things like add something
05:12 - you know, create canvas
two hundred, two hundred
05:16 - you can see here there's
ways, here you can see right
05:21 - here this one comes up, so this is also
05:23 - Visual Studio Code knows
about git and it's showing
05:26 - you things like this one
change and if I click on
05:29 - this here it's kind of showing you this
05:30 - is the new line of code,
that is the current change.
05:34 - You can actually do all
of your git stuff from
05:36 - within Visual Studio Code
yourself but, I tend to
05:39 - do it here, something that
is a little tricky is if
05:42 - you want to not have to always
05:44 - type in your username
or password for GitHub
05:47 - if you're about to send
your code to GitHub
05:50 - there is a way to configure that through a
05:52 - SSH key, I think it makes sense to do that
05:56 - in a separate video if people
are interested in that.
05:58 - The instructions are actually pretty good
06:00 - on the GitHub website, SSH key GitHub.
06:04 - If I go to this,
generating a new SSH key, I
06:08 - always am just following this exactly,
06:11 - and then associating it
with a particular laptop
06:14 - and then that computer is automatically
06:16 - logged in, you should
probably use a passphrase
06:18 - when it asks you, empty for no passphrase,
06:20 - to be more secure.
06:23 - Okay alright, so next,
next up working with nodes
06:27 - Oh, we're almost done.
