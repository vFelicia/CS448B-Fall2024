00:00 - - Hello!
00:01 - And welcome to a new playlist of videos.
00:04 - This is a playlist, hopefully
there's a bunch of videos
00:07 - in this playlist because I'm just starting
00:09 - to record them now so they don't exist yet
00:11 - but this about machine learning and it is
00:12 - for the total beginner.
00:15 - Now there's some caveats
here I suppose to that
00:17 - but I really wanted to make something,
00:19 - you don't have to have
watched any other videos
00:22 - about machine learning on my channel,
00:23 - I have others that go more in
depth and use different tools.
00:24 - This is really meant, if you're starting,
00:26 - it's totally new to you, you've heard
00:28 - the words machine
learning, you've typed them
00:31 - into some learning machine, learning, aah,
00:34 - search bar and somehow
you landed here watching
00:37 - from the future, leaning back,
you've taken your brain out
00:41 - for its afternoon thawing
and you're gelatinous couch
00:46 - is comfortably supporting
your skeletal, okay anyway,
00:51 - the point is you're here, I'm here, hello.
00:55 - So I'm going to be using
for this set of tutorials
00:59 - a pretty new JavaScript
library called ml5.
01:02 - The purpose of this
first video in the series
01:05 - is really just to talk about two things.
01:07 - What is machine learning?
01:08 - What is ml5?
01:09 - So the one caveat I would say, possibly,
01:11 - to being a beginner here
is that you probably want
01:15 - to have some knowledge and
experience with coding itself.
01:19 - Now that isn't to say that
you aren't, if you don't,
01:21 - you're welcome here, please
watch, I will point you
01:24 - to other videos that can help
you fill in some missing gaps
01:27 - but I'm going to assume
a little bit of knowledge
01:29 - about programming,
particularly in JavaScript
01:32 - and I'm also going to be
making fairly heavy use
01:35 - of another JavaScript library called p5.
01:37 - So if p5 is new to you, I'll refer you
01:40 - to some other p5 tutorials.
01:41 - I will but that's going
to be a large piece
01:45 - of how I build various examples throughout
01:47 - all these videos.
01:48 - Okay so before I start talking
to you about what is ml5,
01:53 - which is really what I'm here to do,
01:55 - let's just ask ourselves a question.
01:56 - First of all, it's called
ml5, ml for machine learning,
01:59 - what is machine learning?
02:01 - Now there are lots of
terminology out there.
02:02 - Machine learning, deep learning,
artificial intelligence,
02:05 - neural networks, the list
goes on and on and hopefully
02:09 - the definition that whatever
I say to you right now
02:12 - doesn't really matter because we're going
02:14 - to sort of explore this
topic of machine learning
02:16 - and all these other, all
this other terminology
02:19 - throughout these videos
bu I think one thing
02:21 - to realize about machine
learning, you think of this idea
02:24 - of artificial intelligence,
computers, robots taking over
02:27 - the world and they've
learned their own language
02:29 - and they're defeating
our, but you know, really,
02:32 - when it comes down to it,
brass tacks so to speak,
02:35 - machine learning is examining some data,
02:39 - a whole lot of numbers
02:41 - and trying to make sense of that data
02:45 - and teaching a computer
basically to learn patterns
02:48 - that we can present, that's really,
02:50 - and we're not talking about something
02:52 - called supervised learning here, whoa,
02:54 - even more terminology,
supervised learning,
02:57 - I'm gonna get into all
that and I've gotten
02:58 - into some of that in other videos.
03:00 - So I just pulled up some
notes that I made for a course
03:03 - about artificial
intelligence and at NYU here
03:07 - and this is sort of a classic definition
03:10 - of machine learning from 1959,
03:15 - Arthur Samuels, a field of
study that gives computers
03:18 - the ability to learn without
being explicitly programmed
03:21 - and so let's think
about that for a second.
03:24 - This is actually useful
and I'm gonna get into ml5
03:27 - in a second but just humor
me for a little bit longer.
03:31 - I might say something like
the most simplistic sense,
03:36 - I could write a program that
has a specific algorithm
03:41 - that says
03:43 - if
03:45 - mouseX
03:46 - >,
03:48 - so let's say this window has
a width between zero and 400,
03:52 - its mouseX is > 200,
03:55 - then
03:57 - that is the right side.
04:00 - Can you see this?
04:02 - Yes.
04:03 - > 200 is the right side.
04:04 - Else, if mouseX is < 200 or
just else that's the left side.
04:10 - This is me providing the
computer, so to speak,
04:14 - I've written a program
to some intelligence.
04:16 - It knows how to tell if a
point is on the right side
04:19 - or the left side of the window.
04:21 - I have written the algorithm for that.
04:23 - Well machine learning is
about teaching a system
04:27 - to understand a data
without explicitly writing
04:32 - your own algorithm, this
might be the most trivial,
04:35 - simplistic algorithm ever but the way
04:38 - I would do machine learning
is I would say hey,
04:41 - machine learning system,
I'm going to give you lots
04:46 - of information, like 350 is
on the right side and 301
04:51 - is on the right side and
212 is on the right side
04:53 - and 273 is on the right side
and 100 is on the left side
04:57 - and 97 is on the left side
and 24 is on the left side
05:01 - and 198 is on the left side.
I'm creating a data set
05:04 - and I'm just gonna say
here's a lot of stuff,
05:06 - I'm not gonna tell you how to,
don't, I'm not gonna give you
05:09 - some specific hard coated
algorithm to know what's
05:12 - on the right or the left,
I'm just going to create
05:14 - a data set, it's going to
have a lot of information
05:16 - in it and the machine is
going to learn the patterns
05:20 - in that data, learn how to
make some kind of prediction,
05:25 - that's a key word here,
the prediction being
05:28 - is this point on the right
or left based on that data.
05:30 - This is the essence of machine learning,
05:33 - teaching a computer to perform a task
05:36 - without explicitly programming
the algorithm for that task.
05:41 - Now, it's a little convoluted
'cause aren't we programming
05:44 - the machine learning
algorithm and that's sort
05:46 - of programming but this
is the conceptual idea.
05:49 - Okay, so now that we, as best as I could,
05:52 - made some definition, created a definition
05:55 - of machine learning, one that
at least we can start with
05:57 - and I'm sure I'll hear
from you in the comments.
05:59 - Let's talk about what is ml5.
06:01 - So before I talk about what is ml5,
06:03 - I wanna just mention
someone to you, Red Burns,
06:05 - who is the founder of the program
06:07 - where I currently teach called ITP.
06:09 - Red Burns is a huge source of inspiration,
06:13 - she was a mentor to me
and I wanted to start say,
06:16 - I wanted to read a few quotes from her.
06:18 - I actually have a whole
book of Red Burns quotes
06:20 - but these I think, these
quotes are really important
06:21 - and they are the kind of
driving principles behind
06:24 - a lot of the work that
I do but in particular
06:27 - a lot of the reasons
behind the ml5 project so,
06:32 - "technology is not enough."
06:36 - "Consider the technology," I
should really move the mouse.
06:40 - "Technology is not enough."
06:44 - "Consider the technology
as a tool which, in itself,
06:47 - "could do nothing."
06:48 - "Treat the technology as
something that everyone
06:50 - "on the team could learn,
understand and explore freely."
06:55 - So this is really important.
06:59 - Don't believe the hype.
07:01 - Is that an expression that people say?
07:03 - But it's easy to get caught up in
07:04 - the shining technology stuff but we have
07:07 - to remember that without human
beings here on this planet,
07:14 - right, what's the point? So
while I'm really interested
07:16 - and I get lost in my
interesting just sort of numbers
07:19 - and algorithms and patterns
and things like that,
07:22 - that's I think a sort of core
value that I want to make sure
07:24 - I stay grounded to throughout anytime
07:27 - that I'm looking at algorithms
and thinking about how
07:30 - to use technology, how to teach technology
07:33 - and how to make use of it.
07:35 - So this is actually from an
article from the ITP Journal,
07:37 - Adjacent, there will be a link to this
07:40 - in this video's
description which describes
07:41 - sort of the background about the machine,
07:44 - ml5 project itself. At the end
of this video, I want to talk
07:47 - about various people
who made contributions
07:50 - which I have here on this
link so I will do that
07:52 - but let's talk about what is ml5.
07:54 - So in order to kind of
figure out what ml5 is,
07:59 - I'm going to try to make some diagrams.
08:03 - This is gonna be great.
08:05 - I can feel it right now.
08:07 - So I'm gonna put ml5
right here in the center.
08:11 - Now, an important component
of this discussion
08:15 - is a library called p5.js.
08:19 - Another really important
component of this discussion,
08:24 - I'm gonna put it up here, is
a library called TensorFlow.js
08:30 - and, oh boy, oh boy, another
really important part
08:35 - of this discussion is just
the library TensorFlow itself
08:40 - as well as you know maybe sort
of this thing called Keris
08:44 - which I might refer to.
08:45 - So first of all, what is ml5.js?
08:48 - Ml5.js itself is just
a JavaScript library.
08:55 - It is a library of
functions that you can call
09:01 - from your own JavaScript code.
09:03 - So again, I mention that I'm
gonna rely heavily on p5.
09:06 - P5 is also just a JavaScript library.
09:09 - P5 is a little bit of a
special JavaScript library.
09:14 - Make a little heart there.
09:16 - A couple stars.
09:17 - Because it is really, it
doesn't necessarily conform
09:20 - to the standard patterns you might find
09:23 - in other JavaScript libraries.
09:24 - It makes a lot of
decisions to be as friendly
09:27 - and welcoming and well-suited
for a beginner as it can be.
09:30 - So one of the things you
can do in regular, in p5,
09:33 - is you can write a function called setup
09:37 - and any code that you
put in setup executes
09:42 - the moment the program starts.
09:44 - You can write a function called draw
09:48 - and any code that you put in draw happens
09:51 - in a loop over and over again
09:52 - and this is a standard
kind of design pattern
09:55 - for writing a program that
generates an animation
09:59 - like a game or a piece of interactive art.
10:02 - So what I'm saying here
is that my examples
10:04 - that I'm gonna show you
in these video tutorials
10:07 - are using p5.js almost as
like the base starting point
10:10 - and then I am also going
to import the ml5 library
10:14 - so I need to import
both of these libraries
10:17 - and I'll show you how to
do that in the html file,
10:22 - which is something you'll
see in the code examples
10:24 - and once I have the ml5 library,
10:26 - I can start to do things like this.
10:29 - Ml5 image classifier.
10:33 - So this is a function setup,
is something that's sort of
10:37 - specific to p5, draw is
something specific to p5
10:41 - and then image classifier
well we kind of know
10:44 - it's specific to ml5 because I had
10:46 - to write ml5.imageclassifier
so this is one thing
10:49 - I'm a little bit off on a tangent here
10:52 - which is no surprise if you
watch any of my videos before
10:55 - but a lot of JavaScript
libraries are name spaced
10:58 - meaning if I'm gonna call a function like
11:01 - the image classification function,
11:02 - I've gotta say the name of the library dot
11:04 - that function name.
11:05 - So image classification,
this is one of a common task,
11:08 - common machine learning
task, right, I'm gonna say,
11:12 - "Hey, machine learning, here's some images
11:15 - "of kitty cats, here's
some images of puppy dogs,
11:19 - "learn about them."
11:20 - And we're gonna see how you
could do that exact kind
11:23 - of task with ml5 itself.
11:25 - Okay so this is the basic idea.
11:28 - (sighs)
11:29 - Now, why am I talking about this?
11:33 - So here's the thing.
11:34 - If you just were wandering
around the streets of,
11:38 - I don't know, Venice, Italy,
11:40 - I don't know why I thought of that,
11:41 - they don't have streets,
it's all, like, canals,
11:43 - oh my god, that's crazy.
11:45 - You're paddling through
the canals of Venice, Italy
11:50 - and you go to the little canoe.
Is that what they call it?
11:54 - No, the boat next to you, and you say,
11:56 - "Hey, do you know how
to do machine learning?"
11:58 - Somebody will probably
say, "Oh, you just go use
12:00 - "the thing called TensorFlow."
12:02 - Now it is possible they
say something like,
12:03 - "Oh you just go use this
other thing like pie torch,"
12:05 - or I don't know, something else.
12:08 - But there are many, many
examples of libraries,
12:12 - most of 'em open source
libraries that have
12:16 - a lot of functionality for
common machine learning tasks.
12:19 - One of the most well-known ones of those
12:22 - is called TensorFlow.
12:24 - This is a project from Google.
12:27 - It is open source and most of the time,
12:30 - if you are using it, you
would be writing code
12:33 - in the Python programming language.
12:36 - Well in my tutorials,
I will be writing code
12:39 - in JavaScript programming languages,
12:41 - programming language, not in Python.
12:44 - Well, amazingly, there
happens to be this other thing
12:47 - called TensorFlow.js also
developed by Google researchers,
12:52 - I will include a lot of information
12:55 - about how you can find
out more information
12:57 - about TensorFlow.js and the
creators of TensorFlow.js
12:59 - in the video's description
but this is a version
13:02 - of TensorFlow written in JavaScript.
13:04 - Now in truth, TensorFlow
really, by the way,
13:07 - is really running C++ code so
even when you write your code
13:10 - in Python, it's just running
other stuff that's C++
13:13 - but that's not the case
with TensorFlow.js.
13:15 - TensorFlow.js is everything's
happening in JavaScript
13:18 - and ml5 and you could go and
just use TensorFlow.js directly
13:23 - to do your machine
learning stuff and I have
13:25 - some video tutorials that
talk about that but ml5
13:28 - is a project that actually
wrap, that is a layer,
13:33 - it includes TensorFlow.js
so ml5's a library
13:36 - where additional functions
were added on top
13:41 - of TensorFlow.js to make
certain tasks easier
13:44 - and in truth, this is a low level library.
13:47 - I mean if you were to use it directly,
13:49 - you have to really worry about
things like memory management
13:52 - and this kind of stuff
is eh, it's interesting,
13:58 - you could do it but if
you're just getting started
14:01 - and want to learn the
basics of machine learning
14:04 - and experiment and play, this
is going to be in your way.
14:07 - It's gonna make things
take longer and so ml5,
14:09 - the goal is to make a lot of
the things that you're doing
14:14 - in TensorFlow.js a bit
easier and more accessible.
14:17 - Okay so here's the other thing
14:19 - that I really want to discuss.
14:23 - There are three, I would
say, I'm gonna give you,
14:27 - I'm gonna talk about three
components of the field
14:30 - of machine learning right now.
14:34 - There are particular
machine learning algorithms.
14:37 - One example of that is
something that you might
14:39 - have heard of called a neural network.
14:42 - This is an algorithm to
perform machine learning task.
14:46 - There are many other
examples of algorithms.
14:49 - There are also, there's something known
14:53 - as machine learning models
14:55 - and in particular, there's this
idea of a pre-trained model.
15:00 - So I want to talk about that in a second
15:04 - and then of course we have this
idea of data and data sets.
15:10 - So I'm going to circle
this here for a moment.
15:13 - I'm going to put my stars next to it
15:17 - because this is essentially
where we will begin.
15:22 - You and me and the people from the future
15:25 - who are watching this video
15:27 - or that have time traveled
in to the past, I don't know.
15:29 - Whatever.
15:30 - This is where we're gonna begin.
15:32 - Now, most machine, a lot of
machine learning tutorials
15:35 - will start with something
like and now we will look
15:37 - at linear regression, it's
kind of somewhere in that thing
15:39 - where I was like, I had
that line in the middle
15:42 - of the window or the points
on the right or the left
15:43 - and we're gonna do linear, so
there's a lot of mathematics
15:45 - and statistical components of
machine learning algorithms
15:49 - but one of the things that is
happening in the world today,
15:55 - the reason why I'm hoping
that this video tutorial
15:58 - and this ml5 library
is important and useful
16:02 - is that our lives are
increasingly being governed
16:07 - by pre-trained models.
16:11 - Corporations train models
to perform a particular task
16:14 - to recognize your face, to
turn the words you're speaking
16:18 - into text, there are questionable,
16:22 - many questionably ethical
applications of this.
16:25 - There are also fun, artistic
and playful applications
16:28 - of this so one of the ways
I think to get started
16:31 - as a beginner to machine
learning is actually not
16:33 - to learn all the math
and learn how to train
16:36 - all your own machine learning systems
16:39 - but to actually make use
of some pre-trained models
16:41 - that are out there, for example, the thing
16:44 - that I'll start with in the next video
16:45 - is a model called mobile net.
16:48 - This is a model that's
been trained to recognize
16:51 - the content of images but
there are lots of images
16:54 - that I could show to that
model that it will have
16:56 - no knowledge about and other
ones that it will weirdly have
16:59 - a incredibly obscure
detailed knowledge about.
17:02 - Why is that?
17:03 - Well what was the data that
was used to train that model?
17:06 - What was the algorithm?
17:07 - What algorithm is that model using?
17:09 - These are the critical important questions
17:12 - that we of citizens of this
world increasingly governed
17:16 - and controlled by software
need to feel confident
17:19 - and capable of asking and so by taking,
17:23 - by friendly and accessible,
approachable ways
17:27 - of being able to experiment
with pre-trained models,
17:30 - this is a good place to start.
17:32 - All right so machine learning is a thing,
17:34 - it's the thing people are talking about.
17:36 - We wanna get some experience
playing around with it,
17:40 - experimenting with it,
understanding what it is.
17:42 - We're gonna use this ml5 library.
17:45 - I'm gonna show you how to import it.
17:47 - I'm gonna show you how to
import it into a p5.js sketch
17:50 - and I'm gonna show you how to start
17:52 - to use pre-trained models
and we're gonna look
17:54 - at what those models do well,
what they don't do well,
17:56 - where do they come from and
why do they exist, okay.
17:58 - So actually before I go, let's
look at a couple more things.
18:03 - All right, so you know I've
encourage you actually before
18:05 - you watch the next video,
if you're continuing
18:07 - to watch these videos,
to just check out the,
18:09 - go to ml5.js.org, I would
encourage you to click on,
18:12 - there's lots of stuff to read
about here but I encourage you
18:14 - to click on examples and go
down and just try all of these.
18:18 - So you can see there's
some pre-trained models
18:21 - that I'm gonna be using, I'm
gonna do a tutorial basically
18:23 - about each one of these,
notably I'll mention one
18:25 - called PoseNet which
actually can take an image
18:28 - and estimate your pose,
meaning where your hands,
18:30 - where your shoulders, where your eyes,
18:33 - where your hips, I might be getting that
18:35 - somewhat wrong there but
that's a pre-trained model,
18:38 - just like a pre-trained model learns how
18:40 - to classify the content of an image,
18:43 - here's a pre-trained model that looks how
18:46 - to figure out where the human
body is in a particular image.
18:48 - So we'll be looking at
those, I encourage you
18:50 - to sort of click around here.
18:54 - I also want to just quickly
go to this twitter thread
18:57 - that I posted, just to
kind of give a little bit
19:02 - of background and particularly
credit because ml5.js
19:05 - is not a library that I created,
it's a project certainly
19:07 - that I have worked on
but it came from many,
19:09 - many other people so
first thing to mention,
19:11 - and I did talk about this,
that ml5.js is a layer
19:15 - on top of TensorFlow.js so
all of the heavy lifting
19:19 - behind the scenes really comes
from this library which was,
19:21 - many people are working
on and contributing
19:22 - to this library at Google and otherwise
19:24 - but the project was initiated
by Nikhil and Daniel,
19:25 - researchers at Google.
19:27 - The development was funded

19:30 - of the Google Big Picture Group,
19:32 - the Google Big Picture
Group and the people
19:35 - at + AI Research Initiative which was led
19:38 - by Martin Wattenberg and Fernando Viegas.
19:41 - And they've done a lot
of wonderful projects
19:45 - about visualization and machine learning.
19:48 - The style and approach of
our library really comes from
19:52 - the processing foundation, I
mentioned the relationship,
19:56 - I guess I meant to say the
reason why the 5 is here
20:01 - is because of the sort
of symbiotic relationship
20:05 - with p5, we've made sure, ml5 library,
20:08 - you absolutely do not
need to use p5 with it
20:11 - but it is fully compatible
with p5 and the spirit
20:15 - of p5 I think, in its welcoming
and inclusive sensibility
20:22 - is a present in the ml5 library
and so as a thank you to p5,
20:28 - we've used the 5 there.
20:30 - Okay.
20:35 - Cristobal Valenzuela who is
also the creator of runwayml
20:39 - which you should definitely check out,
20:42 - started this project at ITP
by creating a few examples

people who have contributed.
22:39 - So this has been my introduction to ml5,
22:42 - the library itself and guess what,
22:45 - if you made it through
this video, congratulations
22:47 - because in all the rest of the videos,
22:50 - I'm really just going to be
coding and talking through
22:52 - how to make certain
examples, how they work
22:54 - and what the pieces of those examples are.
22:56 - So thanks for watching this first video

23:06 - See ya there, maybe.
23:08 - (upbeat music)

Cleaned transcript:

Hello! And welcome to a new playlist of videos. This is a playlist, hopefully there's a bunch of videos in this playlist because I'm just starting to record them now so they don't exist yet but this about machine learning and it is for the total beginner. Now there's some caveats here I suppose to that but I really wanted to make something, you don't have to have watched any other videos about machine learning on my channel, I have others that go more in depth and use different tools. This is really meant, if you're starting, it's totally new to you, you've heard the words machine learning, you've typed them into some learning machine, learning, aah, search bar and somehow you landed here watching from the future, leaning back, you've taken your brain out for its afternoon thawing and you're gelatinous couch is comfortably supporting your skeletal, okay anyway, the point is you're here, I'm here, hello. So I'm going to be using for this set of tutorials a pretty new JavaScript library called ml5. The purpose of this first video in the series is really just to talk about two things. What is machine learning? What is ml5? So the one caveat I would say, possibly, to being a beginner here is that you probably want to have some knowledge and experience with coding itself. Now that isn't to say that you aren't, if you don't, you're welcome here, please watch, I will point you to other videos that can help you fill in some missing gaps but I'm going to assume a little bit of knowledge about programming, particularly in JavaScript and I'm also going to be making fairly heavy use of another JavaScript library called p5. So if p5 is new to you, I'll refer you to some other p5 tutorials. I will but that's going to be a large piece of how I build various examples throughout all these videos. Okay so before I start talking to you about what is ml5, which is really what I'm here to do, let's just ask ourselves a question. First of all, it's called ml5, ml for machine learning, what is machine learning? Now there are lots of terminology out there. Machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence, neural networks, the list goes on and on and hopefully the definition that whatever I say to you right now doesn't really matter because we're going to sort of explore this topic of machine learning and all these other, all this other terminology throughout these videos bu I think one thing to realize about machine learning, you think of this idea of artificial intelligence, computers, robots taking over the world and they've learned their own language and they're defeating our, but you know, really, when it comes down to it, brass tacks so to speak, machine learning is examining some data, a whole lot of numbers and trying to make sense of that data and teaching a computer basically to learn patterns that we can present, that's really, and we're not talking about something called supervised learning here, whoa, even more terminology, supervised learning, I'm gonna get into all that and I've gotten into some of that in other videos. So I just pulled up some notes that I made for a course about artificial intelligence and at NYU here and this is sort of a classic definition of machine learning from 1959, Arthur Samuels, a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed and so let's think about that for a second. This is actually useful and I'm gonna get into ml5 in a second but just humor me for a little bit longer. I might say something like the most simplistic sense, I could write a program that has a specific algorithm that says if mouseX >, so let's say this window has a width between zero and 400, its mouseX is > 200, then that is the right side. Can you see this? Yes. > 200 is the right side. Else, if mouseX is < 200 or just else that's the left side. This is me providing the computer, so to speak, I've written a program to some intelligence. It knows how to tell if a point is on the right side or the left side of the window. I have written the algorithm for that. Well machine learning is about teaching a system to understand a data without explicitly writing your own algorithm, this might be the most trivial, simplistic algorithm ever but the way I would do machine learning is I would say hey, machine learning system, I'm going to give you lots of information, like 350 is on the right side and 301 is on the right side and 212 is on the right side and 273 is on the right side and 100 is on the left side and 97 is on the left side and 24 is on the left side and 198 is on the left side. I'm creating a data set and I'm just gonna say here's a lot of stuff, I'm not gonna tell you how to, don't, I'm not gonna give you some specific hard coated algorithm to know what's on the right or the left, I'm just going to create a data set, it's going to have a lot of information in it and the machine is going to learn the patterns in that data, learn how to make some kind of prediction, that's a key word here, the prediction being is this point on the right or left based on that data. This is the essence of machine learning, teaching a computer to perform a task without explicitly programming the algorithm for that task. Now, it's a little convoluted 'cause aren't we programming the machine learning algorithm and that's sort of programming but this is the conceptual idea. Okay, so now that we, as best as I could, made some definition, created a definition of machine learning, one that at least we can start with and I'm sure I'll hear from you in the comments. Let's talk about what is ml5. So before I talk about what is ml5, I wanna just mention someone to you, Red Burns, who is the founder of the program where I currently teach called ITP. Red Burns is a huge source of inspiration, she was a mentor to me and I wanted to start say, I wanted to read a few quotes from her. I actually have a whole book of Red Burns quotes but these I think, these quotes are really important and they are the kind of driving principles behind a lot of the work that I do but in particular a lot of the reasons behind the ml5 project so, "technology is not enough." "Consider the technology," I should really move the mouse. "Technology is not enough." "Consider the technology as a tool which, in itself, "could do nothing." "Treat the technology as something that everyone "on the team could learn, understand and explore freely." So this is really important. Don't believe the hype. Is that an expression that people say? But it's easy to get caught up in the shining technology stuff but we have to remember that without human beings here on this planet, right, what's the point? So while I'm really interested and I get lost in my interesting just sort of numbers and algorithms and patterns and things like that, that's I think a sort of core value that I want to make sure I stay grounded to throughout anytime that I'm looking at algorithms and thinking about how to use technology, how to teach technology and how to make use of it. So this is actually from an article from the ITP Journal, Adjacent, there will be a link to this in this video's description which describes sort of the background about the machine, ml5 project itself. At the end of this video, I want to talk about various people who made contributions which I have here on this link so I will do that but let's talk about what is ml5. So in order to kind of figure out what ml5 is, I'm going to try to make some diagrams. This is gonna be great. I can feel it right now. So I'm gonna put ml5 right here in the center. Now, an important component of this discussion is a library called p5.js. Another really important component of this discussion, I'm gonna put it up here, is a library called TensorFlow.js and, oh boy, oh boy, another really important part of this discussion is just the library TensorFlow itself as well as you know maybe sort of this thing called Keris which I might refer to. So first of all, what is ml5.js? Ml5.js itself is just a JavaScript library. It is a library of functions that you can call from your own JavaScript code. So again, I mention that I'm gonna rely heavily on p5. P5 is also just a JavaScript library. P5 is a little bit of a special JavaScript library. Make a little heart there. A couple stars. Because it is really, it doesn't necessarily conform to the standard patterns you might find in other JavaScript libraries. It makes a lot of decisions to be as friendly and welcoming and wellsuited for a beginner as it can be. So one of the things you can do in regular, in p5, is you can write a function called setup and any code that you put in setup executes the moment the program starts. You can write a function called draw and any code that you put in draw happens in a loop over and over again and this is a standard kind of design pattern for writing a program that generates an animation like a game or a piece of interactive art. So what I'm saying here is that my examples that I'm gonna show you in these video tutorials are using p5.js almost as like the base starting point and then I am also going to import the ml5 library so I need to import both of these libraries and I'll show you how to do that in the html file, which is something you'll see in the code examples and once I have the ml5 library, I can start to do things like this. Ml5 image classifier. So this is a function setup, is something that's sort of specific to p5, draw is something specific to p5 and then image classifier well we kind of know it's specific to ml5 because I had to write ml5.imageclassifier so this is one thing I'm a little bit off on a tangent here which is no surprise if you watch any of my videos before but a lot of JavaScript libraries are name spaced meaning if I'm gonna call a function like the image classification function, I've gotta say the name of the library dot that function name. So image classification, this is one of a common task, common machine learning task, right, I'm gonna say, "Hey, machine learning, here's some images "of kitty cats, here's some images of puppy dogs, "learn about them." And we're gonna see how you could do that exact kind of task with ml5 itself. Okay so this is the basic idea. (sighs) Now, why am I talking about this? So here's the thing. If you just were wandering around the streets of, I don't know, Venice, Italy, I don't know why I thought of that, they don't have streets, it's all, like, canals, oh my god, that's crazy. You're paddling through the canals of Venice, Italy and you go to the little canoe. Is that what they call it? No, the boat next to you, and you say, "Hey, do you know how to do machine learning?" Somebody will probably say, "Oh, you just go use "the thing called TensorFlow." Now it is possible they say something like, "Oh you just go use this other thing like pie torch," or I don't know, something else. But there are many, many examples of libraries, most of 'em open source libraries that have a lot of functionality for common machine learning tasks. One of the most wellknown ones of those is called TensorFlow. This is a project from Google. It is open source and most of the time, if you are using it, you would be writing code in the Python programming language. Well in my tutorials, I will be writing code in JavaScript programming languages, programming language, not in Python. Well, amazingly, there happens to be this other thing called TensorFlow.js also developed by Google researchers, I will include a lot of information about how you can find out more information about TensorFlow.js and the creators of TensorFlow.js in the video's description but this is a version of TensorFlow written in JavaScript. Now in truth, TensorFlow really, by the way, is really running C++ code so even when you write your code in Python, it's just running other stuff that's C++ but that's not the case with TensorFlow.js. TensorFlow.js is everything's happening in JavaScript and ml5 and you could go and just use TensorFlow.js directly to do your machine learning stuff and I have some video tutorials that talk about that but ml5 is a project that actually wrap, that is a layer, it includes TensorFlow.js so ml5's a library where additional functions were added on top of TensorFlow.js to make certain tasks easier and in truth, this is a low level library. I mean if you were to use it directly, you have to really worry about things like memory management and this kind of stuff is eh, it's interesting, you could do it but if you're just getting started and want to learn the basics of machine learning and experiment and play, this is going to be in your way. It's gonna make things take longer and so ml5, the goal is to make a lot of the things that you're doing in TensorFlow.js a bit easier and more accessible. Okay so here's the other thing that I really want to discuss. There are three, I would say, I'm gonna give you, I'm gonna talk about three components of the field of machine learning right now. There are particular machine learning algorithms. One example of that is something that you might have heard of called a neural network. This is an algorithm to perform machine learning task. There are many other examples of algorithms. There are also, there's something known as machine learning models and in particular, there's this idea of a pretrained model. So I want to talk about that in a second and then of course we have this idea of data and data sets. So I'm going to circle this here for a moment. I'm going to put my stars next to it because this is essentially where we will begin. You and me and the people from the future who are watching this video or that have time traveled in to the past, I don't know. Whatever. This is where we're gonna begin. Now, most machine, a lot of machine learning tutorials will start with something like and now we will look at linear regression, it's kind of somewhere in that thing where I was like, I had that line in the middle of the window or the points on the right or the left and we're gonna do linear, so there's a lot of mathematics and statistical components of machine learning algorithms but one of the things that is happening in the world today, the reason why I'm hoping that this video tutorial and this ml5 library is important and useful is that our lives are increasingly being governed by pretrained models. Corporations train models to perform a particular task to recognize your face, to turn the words you're speaking into text, there are questionable, many questionably ethical applications of this. There are also fun, artistic and playful applications of this so one of the ways I think to get started as a beginner to machine learning is actually not to learn all the math and learn how to train all your own machine learning systems but to actually make use of some pretrained models that are out there, for example, the thing that I'll start with in the next video is a model called mobile net. This is a model that's been trained to recognize the content of images but there are lots of images that I could show to that model that it will have no knowledge about and other ones that it will weirdly have a incredibly obscure detailed knowledge about. Why is that? Well what was the data that was used to train that model? What was the algorithm? What algorithm is that model using? These are the critical important questions that we of citizens of this world increasingly governed and controlled by software need to feel confident and capable of asking and so by taking, by friendly and accessible, approachable ways of being able to experiment with pretrained models, this is a good place to start. All right so machine learning is a thing, it's the thing people are talking about. We wanna get some experience playing around with it, experimenting with it, understanding what it is. We're gonna use this ml5 library. I'm gonna show you how to import it. I'm gonna show you how to import it into a p5.js sketch and I'm gonna show you how to start to use pretrained models and we're gonna look at what those models do well, what they don't do well, where do they come from and why do they exist, okay. So actually before I go, let's look at a couple more things. All right, so you know I've encourage you actually before you watch the next video, if you're continuing to watch these videos, to just check out the, go to ml5.js.org, I would encourage you to click on, there's lots of stuff to read about here but I encourage you to click on examples and go down and just try all of these. So you can see there's some pretrained models that I'm gonna be using, I'm gonna do a tutorial basically about each one of these, notably I'll mention one called PoseNet which actually can take an image and estimate your pose, meaning where your hands, where your shoulders, where your eyes, where your hips, I might be getting that somewhat wrong there but that's a pretrained model, just like a pretrained model learns how to classify the content of an image, here's a pretrained model that looks how to figure out where the human body is in a particular image. So we'll be looking at those, I encourage you to sort of click around here. I also want to just quickly go to this twitter thread that I posted, just to kind of give a little bit of background and particularly credit because ml5.js is not a library that I created, it's a project certainly that I have worked on but it came from many, many other people so first thing to mention, and I did talk about this, that ml5.js is a layer on top of TensorFlow.js so all of the heavy lifting behind the scenes really comes from this library which was, many people are working on and contributing to this library at Google and otherwise but the project was initiated by Nikhil and Daniel, researchers at Google. The development was funded by, with the support of the Google Big Picture Group, the Google Big Picture Group and the people at + AI Research Initiative which was led by Martin Wattenberg and Fernando Viegas. And they've done a lot of wonderful projects about visualization and machine learning. The style and approach of our library really comes from the processing foundation, I mentioned the relationship, I guess I meant to say the reason why the 5 is here is because of the sort of symbiotic relationship with p5, we've made sure, ml5 library, you absolutely do not need to use p5 with it but it is fully compatible with p5 and the spirit of p5 I think, in its welcoming and inclusive sensibility is a present in the ml5 library and so as a thank you to p5, we've used the 5 there. Okay. Cristobal Valenzuela who is also the creator of runwayml which you should definitely check out, started this project at ITP by creating a few examples with the deeplearn.js library which is what TensorFlow, which is what became TensorFlow.js. Yining has done amazing work on importing style transer, Yining she and pix2pix models into ml5. This is, tha's really wonderful. Pikachu, edge to edge Pikachu, Yining hopefully will either be making her own videos that I will point you to or I'll have her in as a guest to go over some of these. Hannah Davis has done a lot of work around data collection and responsible data collection that I encourage you to read about and find on the ml5 website through an artist residency. Nikita Huggins, a resident researcher at ITP really did a ton of work, project management work, vital, important work in shepherding the library through many different stages. The ml5 logo on the website is designed by Alejandro. Hayeon Hwang also gave lots of support to that. Dan Oved actually ported the PoseNet model to TensorFlow.js and ml5.js, I'll be showing this in some video tutorials in the future and the ITP Adjacent Journal which I did mention also, thank you to Stephanie Koltun who did all the editing for that article and I encourage you if you really want to read more about the background instead of listening to me ramble, you can check that out.

And there have been many other contributors that you can find if you go to ml5js.org and you click on code and browse the github repositories and see all the wonderful people who have contributed. So this has been my introduction to ml5, the library itself and guess what, if you made it through this video, congratulations because in all the rest of the videos, I'm really just going to be coding and talking through how to make certain examples, how they work and what the pieces of those examples are. So thanks for watching this first video and I'll see you in the next one which the first thing I'm gonna do is just make a simple image classification example using the mobile net model. See ya there, maybe. (upbeat music)
