00:00 - hello this is the last video for Session
00:04 - two of intelligence and learning a
00:06 - course that I'm teaching right now in
00:07 - 2017 but you a alien of the future
00:11 - watching I am Daniel chief mod human
00:14 - being of Earth okay anyway um oh I've
00:19 - got some sort of evolutionary problem
00:20 - good absolutely
00:23 - anyway you're here you could do a
00:25 - homework assignment so there were so
00:27 - many videos in this session did you
00:28 - actually watch all of them if you did
00:30 - thank you that's wonderful now I'm
00:32 - curious to see what kind of creative
00:34 - projects what's kind of interesting new
00:36 - innovative or just experimental or fun
00:38 - useless ideas can you implement by
00:41 - exploring genetic algorithms and other
00:44 - kinds of evolutionary algorithms
00:45 - algorithms so one thing that you might
00:47 - think about is starting with this
00:50 - Shakespeare monkey example which made up
00:52 - the first four videos of this particular
00:53 - series and what if you were trying to
00:55 - evolve as a target something that wasn't
00:57 - text what slows music or perhaps imagery
00:59 - what if you think of each character as a
01:02 - vector path and like an SVG kind of
01:04 - shape or even each character as a pixel
01:06 - and there are some really interesting
01:07 - ways actually I'm gonna just write here
01:12 - in this video over to Google this
01:13 - project evolved Monalisa genetic
01:15 - algorithm I hope this is going to come
01:17 - up with the right thing that I'm
01:18 - thinking about yeah so this is a
01:20 - wonderful explanation and I'm going to
01:24 - actually maybe click it click on this
01:26 - one I'm back I actually just found the
01:30 - link while I wasn't making this anyway
01:32 - you get the idea I did will edit there
01:34 - so you could think about evolving a
01:38 - image by having the genetic material
01:41 - actually be a list of polygons with
01:44 - certain colors positioned in certain
01:45 - ways and look at this over time if I run
01:47 - this for a while on this is example of
01:49 - evolving an image to look like a Mona
01:53 - Lisa of course you could pick any other
01:55 - image to go to input and this is also a
01:58 - oh this is implementation this this this
02:03 - is a this is an implementation of Roger
02:05 - all Singh's idea which I'm going to
02:08 - click on this particular link and this
02:10 - described
02:12 - the process and how this was developed
02:15 - so that's something you could explore
02:16 - I've looked into a coding challenge
02:18 - actually trying to implement something
02:19 - like this but it you could explore that
02:21 - and you've got the tools for doing that
02:23 - right here in this in this particular
02:25 - example okay some other homework ideas
02:27 - that you might consider you might think
02:30 - about improvements you could make on the
02:33 - smart Rockets example maybe just adding
02:35 - you know just simply from a design idea
02:38 - like this is my smart my smart Rockets
02:41 - example you know the design leaves a lot
02:44 - to be desired and what are some other
02:46 - more complex ways you could think about
02:48 - the obstacles the target does the target
02:50 - move around what's the design of these
02:53 - rockets this is something you could
02:54 - certainly explore and then really I
02:57 - think how could you think about the
02:59 - interactive selection problem so if you
03:01 - remember my interactive selection
03:02 - example it simply just these like really
03:05 - crude designs of spaces with a couple
03:09 - squares and a circle but what's how
03:11 - could you take a design a font a shape a
03:17 - drawing and how can you encode that
03:19 - drawing and be virtualized digital DNA
03:24 - and how could you have users then rate
03:27 - those drawings those designs to evolve
03:29 - towards some other and get new imagery
03:32 - out of that so I think that's an
03:33 - exciting possibility thinking about
03:34 - music evolving music in that way our
03:36 - user listens to music wait music just
03:40 - even mini sequence those are things you
03:41 - could you could try so anyway um finally
03:45 - I would encourage you to think about I'm
03:47 - going to go to this particular example I
03:50 - would encourage you to think about
03:51 - continuous systems and improvements that
03:53 - you might make on steering agents
03:56 - autonomous agents moving throughout
03:57 - through space you know this is just food
03:59 - and poison but what if you add a lot
04:02 - more would get other elements to the
04:04 - environment predators what if you add
04:07 - the idea of mating so they have to be
04:09 - near each other to produce a new
04:11 - creature for the next generation there's
04:13 - a lot of possible things that they could
04:15 - explore so anyway this is me randomly
04:17 - giving useful ideas of things you could
04:19 - try if you mixed up please let me know
04:21 - in the comments share them with me
04:23 - shipment on Twitter and I will see you
04:25 - in session three which will which
04:28 - session three is going to be about
04:29 - classification and regression so I'll
04:32 - see you in those videos if you choose to
04:33 - watch them okay good bye
04:39 - [Music]
04:45 - you

hello this is the last video for Session two of intelligence and learning a course that I'm teaching right now in 2017 but you a alien of the future watching I am Daniel chief mod human being of Earth okay anyway um oh I've got some sort of evolutionary problem good absolutely anyway you're here you could do a homework assignment so there were so many videos in this session did you actually watch all of them if you did thank you that's wonderful now I'm curious to see what kind of creative projects what's kind of interesting new innovative or just experimental or fun useless ideas can you implement by exploring genetic algorithms and other kinds of evolutionary algorithms algorithms so one thing that you might think about is starting with this Shakespeare monkey example which made up the first four videos of this particular series and what if you were trying to evolve as a target something that wasn't text what slows music or perhaps imagery what if you think of each character as a vector path and like an SVG kind of shape or even each character as a pixel and there are some really interesting ways actually I'm gonna just write here in this video over to Google this project evolved Monalisa genetic algorithm I hope this is going to come up with the right thing that I'm thinking about yeah so this is a wonderful explanation and I'm going to actually maybe click it click on this one I'm back I actually just found the link while I wasn't making this anyway you get the idea I did will edit there so you could think about evolving a image by having the genetic material actually be a list of polygons with certain colors positioned in certain ways and look at this over time if I run this for a while on this is example of evolving an image to look like a Mona Lisa of course you could pick any other image to go to input and this is also a oh this is implementation this this this is a this is an implementation of Roger all Singh's idea which I'm going to click on this particular link and this described the process and how this was developed so that's something you could explore I've looked into a coding challenge actually trying to implement something like this but it you could explore that and you've got the tools for doing that right here in this in this particular example okay some other homework ideas that you might consider you might think about improvements you could make on the smart Rockets example maybe just adding you know just simply from a design idea like this is my smart my smart Rockets example you know the design leaves a lot to be desired and what are some other more complex ways you could think about the obstacles the target does the target move around what's the design of these rockets this is something you could certainly explore and then really I think how could you think about the interactive selection problem so if you remember my interactive selection example it simply just these like really crude designs of spaces with a couple squares and a circle but what's how could you take a design a font a shape a drawing and how can you encode that drawing and be virtualized digital DNA and how could you have users then rate those drawings those designs to evolve towards some other and get new imagery out of that so I think that's an exciting possibility thinking about music evolving music in that way our user listens to music wait music just even mini sequence those are things you could you could try so anyway um finally I would encourage you to think about I'm going to go to this particular example I would encourage you to think about continuous systems and improvements that you might make on steering agents autonomous agents moving throughout through space you know this is just food and poison but what if you add a lot more would get other elements to the environment predators what if you add the idea of mating so they have to be near each other to produce a new creature for the next generation there's a lot of possible things that they could explore so anyway this is me randomly giving useful ideas of things you could try if you mixed up please let me know in the comments share them with me shipment on Twitter and I will see you in session three which will which session three is going to be about classification and regression so I'll see you in those videos if you choose to watch them okay good bye you
