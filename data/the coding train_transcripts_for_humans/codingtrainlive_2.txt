02:12 - uh just doing my sound check i see a few
02:14 - of you in the chat
02:15 - asking what are the topics for today
02:18 - um i am going to look at extending
02:22 - a self-avoiding walk into 3d
02:25 - i am going to look at the bezier
02:27 - function in
02:28 - p5.js and i will be demoing a
02:32 - new discord bot that is in the coding
02:35 - train discord
02:36 - and um what else what else
02:40 - i think that's about it i'll also be
02:42 - streaming tomorrow
02:44 - the pinned comment hopefully has this
02:46 - list okay
02:47 - let me know if my audio is working all
02:49 - right b we are beginning

06:34 - good morning hello happy i was about to
06:36 - say happy friday but it's not friday
06:38 - it's
06:38 - thursday and i'm here live
06:41 - on the coding train broadcasting to you
06:46 - and i see that my mic is on and i see
06:47 - that my picture is visible to me
06:49 - so hopefully all that's working you oh
06:51 - gloria did i just wake you up with my
06:53 - loud voice
06:55 - uh i wish i need a dog cam i really need
06:57 - a puppy cam where are you going gloria
06:59 - oh you're going downstairs stay with me
07:01 - stay up here have a little rest
07:03 - oh okay i gotta pay attention to you
07:06 - welcome if this is your
07:08 - first time tuning into a live stream oh
07:11 - boy
07:11 - um welcome i already said welcome this
07:14 - is kind of what happens i'll get lost
07:16 - and lose track of what i'm talking about
07:18 - and where i am and what's going on
07:20 - but i hopefully get to some coding stuff
07:22 - that will interest you
07:24 - um if if this is your first time at all
07:27 - ever tuning into anything the coding
07:29 - drain then well
07:30 - by golly really welcome but um
07:34 - and what this is is this is a weekly
07:37 - semi-weekly missing a lot of weeks here
07:40 - and there probably
07:41 - i had to guess i think i probably make
07:43 - 30 to 35 weeks out of the year
07:46 - a live stream where i cover a random
07:48 - smattering of topics
07:50 - in coding particularly around graphics
07:53 - and i'm using javascript and i often use
07:57 - various tools from the processing
07:59 - foundation like p5.js and processing to
08:01 - make
08:02 - creative and fun playful projects for
08:05 - you the people of the internet to
08:06 - hopefully
08:07 - learn something from be inspired by and
08:09 - go off and make your own
08:11 - version of it but this live stream is
08:13 - the unstructured sort of companion to
08:15 - what is otherwise on the channel
08:17 - a lot of sort of sequence tutorials for
08:19 - certain kinds of tasks and projects
08:21 - et cetera this is very unplanned
08:23 - unscripted um
08:25 - and kind of a mess but i'm back
08:30 - because it's been a really rough year i
08:32 - know it's been a rough year for all of
08:34 - you
08:34 - watching for everyone around the world
08:36 - um it's been a tricky year for me i
08:38 - let me just take a moment here to say
08:41 - congratulations to
08:42 - all of the teachers um education workers
08:46 - the students whether you're in you know
08:48 - second grade
08:49 - seventh grade in high school in college
08:52 - in graduate school
08:54 - wow i mean in all industries and types
08:57 - of walks of life it's been
08:59 - a tough year but i know this is the
09:00 - moment where a lot of people are
09:01 - graduating
09:03 - and i just want to say well done people
09:06 - it's been really hard and strange and i
09:09 - have done
09:09 - uh i would say a medium to poor job over
09:12 - the last
09:13 - year and um i i'm looking forward to
09:17 - having a little bit of a break finally
09:19 - this summer um which it's it's been
09:21 - quite a while um and hopefully you're
09:23 - gonna get one
09:24 - as well two fix the wrinkled green
09:27 - screen says cat king
09:29 - where is it is it like just this little
09:32 - tiny thing is bothering you it is kind
09:33 - of bothering me as well
09:35 - okay there we go

09:47 - um and that you uh hopefully you're what
09:50 - aren't you in school right now i don't
09:52 - know what but maybe you're in a time
09:54 - zone where you're not in school right
09:55 - now
09:55 - if you're watching this in school
09:58 - i don't know i don't know what to say to
10:02 - that all right i have fixed
10:05 - that let's see all right what do i have
10:07 - uh let me thank um today's sponsor
10:09 - uh oh i have to go oh i have to go over
10:11 - here and reveal some stuff
10:14 - um uh that's me this is my sponsor of
10:17 - today brilliant
10:18 - um if you think that learning from
10:21 - watching youtube or from having a
10:23 - geometry mug
10:25 - is uh for you then guess what's really
10:27 - for you uh brilliant you can sign up for
10:29 - free at brilliant.org
10:31 - codingtrain um it's a wonderful
10:33 - educational website with all sorts of
10:35 - interactive lessons in
10:37 - uh the sciences and math and computer
10:39 - science and programming and
10:40 - geometry and all the stuff that i love i
10:42 - think you might like it too
10:44 - uh so check that out i'll come back and
10:46 - look at the website a little more uh
10:47 - during in halfway through today's uh
10:50 - stream
10:51 - so um what do i have uh
10:55 - for you today
11:00 - so i'm try i aspire
11:03 - to have a plan and a schedule and set
11:06 - topics
11:07 - and segments and it's been i don't know
11:10 - how long i got to figure out like how
11:12 - long i've really been doing this
11:14 - because i can tell you that i've been
11:16 - making video tutorials since
11:18 - probably for 10 at least 10 years
11:22 - when did i first start uploading those
11:24 - videos to youtube
11:26 - i think around 2015. i think that's
11:30 - right
11:30 - when did i do my first live stream well
11:33 - that's
11:34 - findable it's there it's still on the
11:36 - channel
11:37 - uh when did i start calling myself
11:39 - coding
11:40 - redacted when did i start calling the
11:44 - channel coding train all of those things
11:47 - are um points
11:50 - in the history of this project that i
11:52 - would like to kind of like accumulate
11:54 - and track maybe
11:55 - you know by the way there's no wikipedia
11:58 - page for the cody gray i don't know if
11:59 - they're
11:59 - merits being one or there should be one
12:02 - but um
12:02 - anybody's got some spare cycles and
12:05 - wants to create one to sort of track
12:07 - some of this
12:07 - uh history i'm happy to help i'm not
12:09 - gonna uh help edit the page but
12:11 - happily help provide any of the
12:14 - information and references for that
12:16 - but i'm just thinking about are there
12:17 - any anniversaries coming up but the
12:18 - reason why i brought this up is like
12:20 - i've been doing this for quite a while
12:21 - and still it's just a mess and um
12:25 - i'm i have some changes upcoming i'm i'm
12:27 - hoping to
12:28 - redo where i live broadcast from
12:31 - um and have a bit more of a a larger
12:34 - space to work with with some different
12:36 - with some
12:37 - i want to get some kind of toys in that
12:39 - space um working with
12:41 - uh like a vinyl cutter and some other
12:44 - physical stuff that i want to try to
12:45 - make stuff
12:46 - live with some like led like things so
12:49 - that's coming
12:50 - um but right now i'm still i'm where i
12:53 - am mentally physically emotionally is
12:56 - just trying to
12:57 - get the academic year wrapped up and get
13:00 - organized for the summer
13:02 - and i'm still playing catch-up so the
13:04 - topics that i have today
13:06 - are pretty much um i'm just sort of
13:10 - looking at the chat here so first i want
13:11 - to share some community contributions
13:14 - um i will be doing that this is the
13:18 - community contributions that's my
13:20 - community contributions theme song
13:22 - uh i want to do that i am very close to
13:26 - releasing
13:27 - a coding challenge video about a
13:29 - self-avoiding walk
13:30 - and one of the suggested exercises i
13:33 - suggest in the video
13:34 - is to extend it into 3d so i would like
13:37 - to
13:38 - show a version of that and i haven't had
13:40 - time to make it so i'll just try making
13:42 - that on today's live stream
13:44 - that's a plan uh and then oh
13:47 - by golly i have failed
13:50 - i mean i failed like get get out get out
13:53 - your notepad
13:54 - if you want to list all my failures in
13:56 - life you better have a lot of pages in
13:58 - that notepad but i
13:59 - and i haven't failed yet i'm um but i
14:01 - have failed to
14:03 - complete something that i have promised
14:05 - to make
14:06 - um and i uh i want to make sure that i
14:09 - do that in june
14:10 - and what it is is creating video
14:13 - tutorials
14:14 - that were requested by donors to the
14:17 - processing foundation
14:20 - annual fundraiser so i don't know if
14:22 - this is easily
14:23 - uh findable but let me go oh you don't
14:26 - see what i'm looking at
14:28 - this is the processing foundation
14:29 - website um if i click over onto
14:32 - donate um i wonder if i can
14:35 - find many i assume some of you watching
14:38 - here are in this wonderful list
14:40 - of names of people thank you for
14:43 - supporting the processing foundation
14:45 - i would like to look for
14:48 - [Music]
14:53 - the annual fundraiser
14:57 - it's very hard to google things with the
15:00 - word processing in it
15:01 - because basically all of my results are
15:03 - processing transactions for donorbox
15:06 - ah somebody will find this link for me
15:08 - and and
15:09 - and and tell me ah support p5 there we
15:11 - go
15:13 - oh that's 2019 donor box page
15:17 - uh what if i change this to 2020
15:22 - very hard life is hard people life is
15:25 - full of 404 errors let me just tell you
15:27 - that
15:29 - all of my many years on this planet none
15:32 - outside of this planet as of yet i've
15:35 - been full
15:36 - of so many 404 errors boy i'm not
15:38 - prepared
15:39 - um but uh one of the rewards for
15:42 - donating to the processing foundation
15:43 - was to
15:44 - uh request a video topic from the coding
15:46 - train
15:48 - um and so um
15:51 - two topics that were requested from the
15:53 - donors one was bezier curve
15:55 - and one was the copy function so i want
15:57 - to spend a little time exploring both of
15:59 - those functions
16:01 - to prepare for what i might put in the
16:03 - actual and i'm thinking this is gonna be
16:04 - like a 10 minute video
16:06 - so you the viewer if you choose to stay
16:08 - with me here today
16:10 - the opportunity to help provide some
16:11 - suggestions or things that i might
16:12 - demonstrate
16:13 - um in the eventual tutorial so uh um um
16:16 - that i'm gonna make so that's
16:18 - that's really on my agenda am i
16:20 - forgetting anything
16:22 - i'm looking here just checking the
16:24 - discord oh my god i forgot the most
16:27 - important thing
16:33 - oh my goodness not the most important
16:36 - thing but a
16:37 - uh because truly they're all
16:39 - everything's they're all important
16:40 - or not important equally and unimportant
16:43 - actually
16:44 - if i really think about it but i would
16:46 - like to demonstrate a new
16:49 - discord bot that is in the coding train
16:51 - discord channel if you're not already in
16:53 - there
16:54 - um let me press a button which will
16:57 - hopefully post it into the chat
16:59 - um the discord channel where we have a
17:02 - lot of plans for the discord channel
17:03 - this summer to hope to
17:05 - do more kind of community engagement
17:07 - very excited about that
17:08 - but there is a new bot that is related
17:10 - to my
17:11 - book of random numbers which if i can
17:15 - find my sound effects
17:17 - i found that was very loud that was me
17:20 - who was loud i found it i had it lost
17:22 - for a while it was in the cabana
17:25 - because i had been using it for um the
17:27 - mouse conference video
17:29 - and i had left it there so it's a little
17:31 - uh weathered
17:32 - a little more weather than it usually is
17:34 - and we haven't done this in a while oh
17:36 - oh wait it's time let's look at the bot
17:38 - because the bot we're starting over
17:40 - today
17:42 - i'm starting i am sisyphus with the
17:45 - random numbers
17:47 - [Laughter]
17:49 - um so i i am sisyphus with the random
17:52 - numbers
17:53 - i am destined to just start this over
17:55 - but today
17:57 - it's this is a momentous occasion
17:58 - because i'm going to start over
18:00 - reading all oh and some lights are
18:03 - blinking i think someone gave a little
18:05 - chat message oh it was simone charlo
18:07 - thank you simone
18:09 - um i am going to start over my project
18:14 - which is to read this entire book i have
18:16 - learned so much about this book i have
18:18 - learned what is
18:20 - quite possibly the the incredibly
18:23 - obvious
18:24 - which is that when this book says a
18:26 - million random digits
18:28 - it has a million random single digits in
18:31 - them
18:32 - i have always read them in groups of
18:33 - five
18:35 - and was oft made the mistake of
18:37 - referring to it as
18:39 - one million five digit numbers which is
18:41 - not all the case there's two hundred
18:42 - thousand five digit numbers
18:46 - but um let's go let's get to the bot
18:48 - because um and then i will
18:49 - um uh read some random numbers uh yeah
18:52 - and so remember how it was saying hello
18:53 - to anybody who's a new viewer
18:55 - it takes me quite a while to get to any
18:57 - coding
18:59 - you know usually i have about 10 minutes
19:00 - left in my 2 hour live stream by the
19:02 - time i'm actually coding something so
19:03 - let me
19:04 - pull let me just do a couple things here
19:07 - let me switch back to here
19:09 - i'm going to pull up discord
19:12 - and oh my goodness and do this quick
19:15 - little
19:16 - fancy trick i have then i need to turn
19:20 - on a streamer mode
19:23 - privacy and safety it must be there
19:25 - right where is the streamer mode it
19:26 - doesn't automatically go on streamer
19:28 - mode
19:28 - is enabled okay so now i'm able to
19:32 - hopefully safe safely
19:37 - nicole nicole bella says omg i'm so glad
19:40 - you have corrected how you'll read the
19:42 - numbers right
19:44 - i mean like it's got i've got
19:47 - i mean i mean right thank you for
19:50 - validating this
19:51 - i feel seen right now so seen okay
19:55 - um
19:58 - all right let's see here
20:01 - i'm going over to here
20:04 - okay so this is the coding train discord
20:06 - lots of channels um i get um i still
20:08 - manage to get
20:09 - a lot of individual emails asking for
20:12 - coding help
20:13 - and i mean in my heart of hearts i would
20:16 - like to respond to every one of those
20:18 - but i just don't have the capacity
20:20 - to um and so this is where i point
20:22 - people to all these channels there's a
20:23 - volunteer team of moderators
20:25 - and lots of friendly faces in the
20:27 - discord so please come and join you can
20:29 - get help with all these different areas
20:33 - but what i am here and then for you
20:35 - there's also there's my favorite channel
20:37 - in the discord which is the pets
20:38 - channel uh oh ah you know what
20:42 - it's maybe the pets is a strong second
20:44 - to introductions
20:45 - i just i read all the introductions by
20:47 - the way it's my favorite channel i just
20:49 - love
20:49 - getting to know everybody who's joining
20:51 - and how they found the videos and that
20:53 - sort of thing so please
20:54 - introduce yourself in there i aspire to
20:57 - maybe
20:57 - i don't know if i aspire this maybe
20:58 - someday it'll be too many people
21:00 - introducing themselves and i won't be
21:01 - able to read them all but
21:02 - i really love that anyway what i am
21:03 - looking for is i yes
21:05 - this is the channel that you're going to
21:07 - want to try
21:08 - the stuff that i'm about to demonstrate
21:10 - to you uh
21:12 - bot testing but i am always very
21:15 - cautious on the internet
21:16 - in terms of what i'm showing on my live
21:17 - stream uh
21:19 - only because i've learned my lesson the
21:23 - hard way
21:23 - and i still get it wrong you know as all
21:25 - of you who have your
21:27 - notebooks full of my private api keys
21:30 - but
21:30 - um here here's my bot demo
21:34 - uh channel so in this bot demo channel
21:36 - which i'm going to
21:37 - there is a new discord bot thank you to
21:39 - saint plays
21:40 - uh who's the manager of the discord
21:44 - david i'm sure who's contributed to this
21:45 - and many other people
21:48 - i'm going to do question mark this new
21:50 - bot let's see here
21:52 - question mark is the way i know there's
21:54 - slash commands now on discord
21:56 - maybe someday we will get to that but
21:59 - the
21:59 - oh i hate how see i need this is my
22:02 - dream in the next
22:03 - live streaming studio is to have a full
22:06 - body camera because i have to the camera
22:09 - is quite close to me
22:11 - so i have to shrink myself and then i'm
22:13 - cut off here
22:14 - which really drives me curiously because
22:15 - i really want to point all the way to
22:17 - that help thing
22:18 - someday someday i'm i'm hoping i'm in an
22:22 - attic and i'm hoping to move to a garage
22:24 - long story for another time if it
22:26 - happens i'll let you know
22:29 - uh question mark i might not be taking a
22:31 - few weeks off if this is happening
22:33 - though because i'll be moving
22:34 - uh question mark uh help
22:37 - um so if i press that
22:40 - um that's how you trigger the choo choo
22:43 - bot
22:44 - so the choo choo bot um actually
22:47 - the choo choo bot which um
22:50 - oh oh i see yes yes yes the choo choo
22:53 - bot is
22:54 - essentially the bot uh now i remember
22:57 - what's happening
22:58 - the choo choo bot i am looking at the
23:00 - chat but just very
23:01 - you can't rely on that to answer sid
23:03 - hart that's question
23:06 - the choo choo bot is the coding train
23:08 - discord bot that is covered
23:11 - in my if i think i go under more
23:14 - under learning discord bot this is my
23:17 - series
23:18 - about how to code your own discord bot
23:20 - it's a series of six videos
23:23 - in theory i would like to there's many
23:24 - more things that i didn't get to that i
23:26 - would like to get to
23:27 - um but if you want to learn how to code
23:29 - your own bot check out these videos
23:32 - but i you know some of the features that
23:33 - are demonstrated are
23:35 - if i just type in i know this is like so
23:37 - tiny i should i just do this
23:40 - i'm i'm going to give up and do this uh
23:42 - choo choo
23:45 - if i do um let me do this uh choo choo
23:48 - oh no question mark choo choo
23:52 - i will get a random reply
23:56 - let's try it one more time
23:59 - i love how people emoji right ding right
24:01 - okay
24:03 - i'll get a random reply another feature
24:05 - is a gif
24:06 - if i just type gif uh it uses the tenor
24:10 - api to pull a random gif with the coding
24:12 - train
24:12 - search but if i say gif uh kitten
24:17 - [Laughter]
24:26 - by the way i'm supposed to have unlocked
24:29 - on my channel
24:30 - a beta feature and youtube or alpha
24:32 - feature called clips
24:34 - i know this has probably been something
24:35 - that's been on twitch for like the last
24:37 - 300 years where you can clip out and
24:39 - share separately as different
24:41 - moments of live streams and videos so
24:43 - you can get a thing of me going
24:48 - here we need a new coding train gif
24:53 - which will somebody will make
24:57 - but it hasn't i don't think it's
24:58 - available on my channel yet i got to get
25:00 - in touch with my
25:01 - youtube friends all right uh
25:06 - what was i saying ah that's one feature
25:08 - another feature
25:09 - what else did i do i did the message
25:13 - the gif i gotta look at my video
25:16 - tutorials
25:17 - i guess that was kind of it
25:21 - hello world posting gifs and then i like
25:23 - organized the code
25:25 - etc etc so that's kind of it but there's
25:28 - some new features which aren't in the
25:29 - tutorials but were implemented by
25:32 - uh the wonderful coding trained discord
25:34 - team and really mostly all
25:37 - same plays um kobe
25:40 - uh and if i do help now what i'm looking
25:42 - for
25:43 - is some new commands
25:47 - random walk find assign
25:51 - get number set easter egg i have no idea
25:54 - what that does
25:55 - random number reading set reading all of
25:58 - those things
26:01 - all of these are related to accessing
26:04 - the contents
26:06 - of this particular random number book
26:09 - and
26:10 - getting your very own unique
26:13 - random number now you will have two
26:16 - things
26:17 - you will have an index if you get one if
26:20 - you choose to get one of these yourself
26:23 - you will have an index into this book
26:27 - one there are one million indices can we
26:30 - ever get to the point where every
26:32 - index is taken by a viewer of the coding
26:35 - train
26:35 - probably not but maybe you will also
26:39 - then have a
26:40 - five-digit random number that
26:43 - starts from that index and that random
26:46 - number
26:47 - that index that that five-digit random
26:50 - number
26:52 - is the starting point to generate your
26:55 - very own
26:56 - unique and custom random walk
26:59 - visualization so to uh
27:03 - to really explain what i'm talking about
27:05 - here i need to
27:06 - circle back and go to
27:10 - coding challenges oh this is all coming
27:12 - full circle
27:14 - random walk this is coding challenge
27:17 - number 52
27:19 - from 2017.
27:22 - uh you could watch this video tutorial
27:24 - but i will just show you
27:26 - the code for it
27:30 - this is what it does is it looks at a
27:33 - random number this is using the p5.js
27:35 - random function one zero one two or
27:37 - three
27:38 - moves up down left right
27:42 - um and if we let this run for one
27:45 - million
27:45 - cycles eventually we would have a
27:48 - particular pattern
27:50 - so what if instead of picking the
27:52 - numbers from the p5.js
27:54 - random function the numbers were picked
27:57 - from this what is the what was i
28:01 - thinking this was
28:02 - my version of the um the dark hold
28:06 - from the uh coding train dark hold is
28:08 - that what it's called
28:10 - whatever somebody will let me know um
28:15 - you will get your own visualization of
28:18 - the rant that what the random walk would
28:20 - look like if you followed all of the
28:21 - digits into the
28:23 - from from the book so without further
28:25 - ado
28:26 - let me first actually log into p5 web
28:29 - editor
28:31 - let me go back to discord i think what i
28:33 - can do is say question mark random walk
28:36 - and we'll just get one of these
28:40 - so this is the random walk pattern
28:43 - starting from position 196931 in the
28:47 - book
28:49 - and the random number there i'm not sure
28:51 - what uh um kobe maybe we need to work on
28:53 - some of the we'll do some edits here
28:55 - i'm not sure what instead is referring
28:57 - to but with the random number two
28:59 - eight four five one so if i do another
29:03 - one
29:07 - here is so we could just call oh it's
29:09 - question mark i always forget it's
29:10 - question mark
29:11 - i could always just say question mark
29:13 - random walk and i'll get a new pattern
29:15 - here's another one
29:17 - um so uh
29:20 - now ah i see oh instead
29:24 - we couldn't get your input that's why oh
29:26 - because i could do a specific one
29:28 - i can say random walk uh one
29:32 - so this will give the
29:35 - position one in the book this is the
29:37 - random walk and the
29:39 - number and i think actually position
29:40 - zero is actually the first
29:42 - position the random number three two
29:45 - five three three okay so now why am i
29:48 - say why
29:48 - why why is this happening well
29:52 - this is just the stuff that i love it's
29:54 - like the most like
29:56 - oddly strange like obsessive use of
29:59 - a book of random numbers that i could
30:01 - possibly think of
30:03 - and a good demonstration of all sorts of
30:05 - concepts in creative coding and
30:07 - randomness
30:08 - and bots and apis and graphics and node
30:11 - and p5
30:12 - and all that stuff but here's if you if
30:15 - you like what you see so far
30:17 - just wait there's more i'm going to say
30:21 - i think it's
30:22 - get number
30:26 - ah no no no um
30:28 - [Music]
30:30 - let's let's ask for help
30:34 - uh find assign get number
30:38 - supporter user my number
30:46 - my saved random number is
30:51 - so this is my unique random number
30:54 - well it's not it might not be a unique
30:56 - random number it should tell me probably
30:58 - what position i'm in also
31:00 - realizing we've got features go we've
31:01 - got feature requests going on
31:05 - this is my random number so
31:08 - now if i were to
31:11 - uh if i were to say i think i could find
31:14 - it
31:16 - find four two six five one
31:21 - it can be found in the book at row nine
31:24 - zero zero four position
31:25 - seven so these are the row and position
31:27 - i also would like to know the index how
31:28 - do i
31:29 - i wanna set my own random number so
31:31 - let's try set
31:36 - okay ah okay so anybody can do this
31:40 - uh now my number should be 73091
31:44 - let's see yes
31:48 - that's my random number
31:52 - i have generated you a random number so
31:55 - now if you happen to be
31:56 - just you know in theory it would be
31:58 - great if everybody could just
32:00 - like pick but there you once you have
32:01 - one nobody else can take it
32:03 - so if you are a viewer of the coding
32:05 - train all you have to do
32:07 - is just type question mark set
32:10 - uh and it will set a new one for you
32:13 - that's very similar to my previous one
32:16 - wow look at that it's so close um but if
32:19 - if you like
32:22 - you uh if you are a
32:27 - it generated me a random one a sign
32:31 - i don't i don't know how this bot works
32:33 - ah
32:34 - oh no this is only for me
32:43 - um so there's some work to be done so
32:46 - i'm looking at various chats here
32:48 - so you can get your own the idea is that
32:50 - you could get your own random number
32:51 - if you're a supporter if you signed up
32:53 - to join through youtube membership
32:55 - you're able to pick your own or in
32:57 - theory i've assigned you one
32:58 - that you when a new person joins i have
33:00 - a little bit where i assign them a
33:02 - random number
33:04 - but then that random number will
33:08 - generate a particular
33:10 - random walk and where if also
33:13 - what is next what is next in your
33:15 - journey uh besides having
33:18 - a um
33:19 - [Music]
33:21 - um besides having just your own random
33:25 - number and unique random walk
33:27 - pattern that you can generate in the
33:29 - discord well
33:31 - bear with me for a moment and i see
33:34 - uh the creator of the spot kobe typing
33:37 - in here
33:38 - discord manager let me go here so
33:41 - what is happening here well look at
33:45 - these
33:45 - beauties these are train whistles
33:50 - handmade i believe in vermont i found a
33:52 - nice little wood shop
33:53 - that makes them they've been shipped all
33:57 - the way to oregon
33:58 - is that how you say it i always get it
33:59 - wrong uh where
34:02 - uh coding train uh illustrator designer
34:05 - extraordinaire
34:06 - jason is working with a laser etcher and
34:09 - i i aspire to be able to have this set
34:11 - up for myself to do as well
34:13 - laser etching the coding train logo onto
34:15 - one side
34:17 - now what's going to go on the other side
34:20 - you might ask
34:23 - um
34:23 - [Music]
34:26 - well this so this was a uh this is not
34:29 - this is a speculative version
34:31 - of getting your own
34:34 - then the random walk pattern that is
34:36 - generated
34:37 - can then be rendered and etched onto the
34:40 - train whistle and
34:41 - shipped to you so at the moment i'm
34:44 - starting with i mean i would love
34:46 - everybody in the world to be able to
34:48 - have one of these if they so choose
34:50 - i'm starting with the sort of conductor
34:52 - level of the youtube memberships
34:54 - uh because it's about matching the sort
34:56 - of cost
34:57 - and time of doing this and then
34:59 - hopefully i'll be able to as
35:00 - after that after i get through that
35:02 - we'll see if i can start offering it to
35:04 - the passengers or
35:05 - or other folks in other ways little
35:08 - presents
35:10 - to go onto my train
35:14 - take a train tour around the world and
35:16 - hand them out
35:17 - but um we're still finalizing the design
35:20 - um but ultimately i think it uh in the
35:22 - end i think i'm going with
35:23 - offering more space on the whistle for
35:26 - the random walk pattern
35:27 - and then the index of to where the
35:29 - random number started
35:31 - as well as the number itself will then
35:33 - be etched there
35:35 - so um this is pretty much all i have to
35:38 - say
35:39 - about this the set command takes a
35:41 - number optionally supporters can use it
35:43 - as set
35:44 - number to pick their number
35:47 - right so but what if i do this
35:51 - am i just not uh maybe i'm not
35:54 - actually a supporter so it's not letting
35:56 - me do it
35:58 - because it's giving me a different
35:59 - random number but to me i think we need
36:01 - to also
36:02 - always offer the number and the index
36:06 - and because the index
36:09 - is really what is driving the unique
36:12 - pattern that the random walk is
36:13 - generating
36:16 - is there anything more for me to say
36:18 - about this play around with this
36:20 - uh post your questions but um
36:23 - it's 10 35 here i am going to
36:28 - look now at the feature of reading and
36:31 - set reading
36:34 - i looked back in time for you shiffman
36:37 - last
36:38 - read the book at page eight oh wait a
36:40 - second
36:46 - welcome mark boots
36:49 - you are the very first passenger to
36:52 - board the code i mean you're all
36:53 - passengers but the
36:55 - you know green highlighted bar in the
36:57 - chat that says passenger welcome to
36:59 - passengers
37:00 - you are the very first one to join with
37:02 - the new system
37:04 - of the bot random numbers and while i
37:06 - could
37:09 - open up my book and find a random number
37:11 - for you
37:13 - let's try out a new
37:17 - um a new
37:21 - uh feature which is
37:26 - random number so now
37:30 - sound effects are all on the wrong page
37:34 - we will now get mark boots
37:39 - random number
37:50 - [Music]
37:53 - [Laughter]
37:56 - did i spell it wrong
37:58 - [Laughter]
38:00 - uh okay
38:04 - uh oh turns out it's called random okay
38:08 - try it again here we go
38:11 - what is this emoji that someone keeps
38:14 - reacting with
38:16 - i fortunately i can't see it but i have
38:18 - a feeling it's
38:19 - something i don't want to see
38:24 - [Music]
38:27 - all right so this is now
38:30 - mark boots now now mark boots
38:34 - if you're not currently in the discord
38:37 - uh i can't actually
38:39 - set and assign this for you right now
38:40 - but please join the discord
38:43 - uh and uh be in touch come into the
38:46 - supportive channels we'll get it all
38:47 - figured out
38:48 - okay so back to
38:52 - back to um
38:55 - reading
38:59 - last read from the book at page 18
39:02 - row six and column one
39:10 - um the emojis are really distracting
39:13 - i totally agree uh um
39:17 - what am i set uh i need help again
39:20 - because i can't i have no
39:21 - my memory does not uh uh set reading
39:24 - okay set reading zero let's see if this
39:27 - works we're starting over people
39:29 - we're starting over
39:35 - please provide a valid page row and
39:38 - column
39:39 - okay i want well
39:42 - i want to be on page
39:54 - the first page of all the random digits
39:57 - is page one
39:58 - the row is zero and the column is zero
40:01 - okay so let's see if this works
40:05 - set reading page one
40:09 - row column aha
40:13 - you have updated the book position to
40:17 - one that should say page one another
40:18 - little live bug report
40:21 - uh row zero and column zero and now
40:24 - we begin
40:27 - for the fourth or fifth time
40:31 - the ceremonial coding train
40:34 - reading of the random numbers
40:38 - i'm just gonna do one row just to ease
40:41 - my way into this
40:44 - one row
40:54 - one zero zero nine seven three
40:57 - two five three three seven six
41:00 - five two zero one three five
41:03 - eight six three four six seven three
41:07 - five four eight seven six eight zero
41:10 - nine
41:11 - five nine zero nine one one seven
41:14 - three nine two nine two seven
41:18 - four nine four five
41:25 - all right
41:30 - i am verklempt now
41:34 - set reading page one
41:39 - row one column zero
41:46 - all right we're good so next time when i
41:49 - am streaming
41:50 - i can just say reading and it will tell
41:52 - me i last read the book
41:53 - at page one row one and column zero so
41:56 - um it's interesting you wanna think
41:59 - about the language here i mean this is a
42:01 - little bit of just semantics here but
42:03 - um this is technically speaking the
42:07 - starting position for the next random
42:09 - number to read
42:10 - so the last read was the end of
42:15 - page one row one column
42:18 - you know whatever and are the columns
42:21 - right there 50 are there 50 columns or
42:24 - are there 10 because we still sometimes
42:25 - think of them in groups of five
42:27 - which might seem arbitrary to you but
42:29 - just to be clear
42:30 - it's not completely arbitrary because
42:32 - this book if i hold it up
42:34 - to the camera
42:37 - and if it would focus on it the numbers
42:40 - are organized in groups of five
42:42 - so that that does have actual meaning
42:45 - the question is would i ever
42:46 - stop reading mid group of five i think i
42:49 - could live with the constraint of
42:51 - not but technically speaking what are
42:54 - the columns oh so much to think about
42:55 - how are we gonna get this right
43:00 - all right um
43:06 - i can't believe this live stream has
43:08 - been 40 minutes
43:09 - uh of of me talking about the random
43:12 - number book
43:14 - i do by the way have a mug with geometry
43:17 - formulas on him
43:19 - is it lovely
43:24 - it's getting quite warm up here where i
43:25 - am you know what it's time for
43:32 - it that's right it's
43:36 - time for community contributions
43:40 - that's right it's the time where i
43:43 - the person live streaming looks at my
43:46 - computer and pulls up things that you
43:48 - the viewers in the coding training have
43:49 - made
43:50 - in response to various videos and
43:52 - examples and things
43:53 - and features them on the stream and
43:55 - mostly just
43:56 - has a big smile and cheers and loves
43:58 - that stuff but
44:04 - what's that
44:08 - breaking news
44:12 - a community contribution came in across
44:15 - my twitter desk
44:16 - just this morning and i'm going to
44:20 - try to find it right now
44:24 - um here it is
44:29 - um let me see if i can zoom into this
44:31 - here for a second
44:33 - this is from and i have permission to
44:35 - share this
44:37 - this is from dhruv jamulia who one hour
44:40 - ago
44:40 - wrote just made an a.i that learns to
44:44 - play
44:44 - tetris using genetic algorithms and
44:47 - p5.js
44:48 - so in a moment i'm going to click on the
44:49 - web application you can see the github
44:51 - there and then
44:52 - there it is thank you i mentioned
44:55 - a huge shout out to shiffman yeah yeah
44:58 - uh
44:59 - just a medium sized a small shout out
45:01 - perfectly fine
45:02 - no need for any huge shout outs whose
45:04 - videos on genetic algorithms inspired me
45:06 - to make this when i clicked on the link
45:07 - my jaw dropped to the floor
45:09 - and i thought wow this is really if i
45:11 - just didn't waste hours without talking
45:13 - about random numbers
45:14 - in my live streams maybe i would have
45:16 - actually built this project because this
45:17 - is on my list
45:19 - um and so dhruv i don't know how you
45:20 - feel about this since you've already
45:21 - made it but on my i would like to uh
45:24 - do a bunch of videos about both coding
45:26 - uh tetris
45:27 - and as well as building an ai with
45:29 - genetic algorithms and neural networks
45:30 - to play it
45:31 - but let's take a look at it i'm going to
45:35 - click over to the webpage
45:39 - and close out the tweet and come back
45:43 - here okay
45:43 - so tetris ai artificial intelligence
45:46 - learning to play the world's most
45:48 - influential
45:49 - puzzle game i'm going to go to the
45:52 - classic
45:53 - we can look at i encourage you to look
45:54 - at the about this is the link if
45:56 - anyone's looking for it tetris
45:58 - ai.netwifi.app
46:00 - um and let's do classic okay
46:03 - now uh so i believe you know i didn't
46:06 - make this to be clear this is a
46:08 - community contribution
46:12 - and you know that because of the music
46:15 - i'm playing
46:18 - uh let's hit start
46:20 - [Music]
46:21 - so what it looks like to me and i'm
46:23 - totally speculating here
46:24 - is that it is just randomly
46:28 - playing this tetris game so randomly
46:30 - moving things left and right
46:31 - randomly rotating them and uh it's tried
46:35 - twice this is very similar to the flappy
46:37 - bird um
46:39 - examples that i've made it's tried it
46:42 - twice four times and each time
46:45 - it's keeping track of what score it got
46:49 - now i'm guessing that whatever mechanism
46:52 - is making the choices
46:53 - uh whatever system of rules you know i
46:55 - can only assume if i were doing this i
46:57 - would probably use my
46:59 - uh neural evolution technique so there's
47:01 - like a neural network that's
47:03 - taking the configuration of the tetris
47:05 - board as its input
47:06 - and then the output is some action like
47:09 - left
47:10 - right left right drop rotate left right
47:13 - i'm not sure whatever the options in
47:14 - tetris are
47:16 - and then whichever ones score the
47:17 - highest after a certain number of times
47:19 - or recombine to make new ones and i'm
47:22 - going to hit increase speed
47:24 - which is one of my uh and we can see it
47:26 - doing a lot more and so i can only
47:28 - assume that after some amount of time i
47:29 - don't know
47:30 - how long we would have to wait um
47:34 - we would get one that plays fairly well
47:37 - so
47:37 - one thing that i think is good to do if
47:39 - i can if you'll humor me
47:41 - uh with a little um feedback here is
47:44 - uh if after this has been run for a
47:47 - while
47:47 - to be able to save the state you could
47:50 - use
47:50 - even local storage for that or perhaps
47:53 - just save the current
47:55 - like configuration of the high scorer
47:57 - might be an excellent thing that you
47:59 - could load back and that's something
48:00 - that
48:01 - i think that i did with my um flappy
48:04 - bird
48:05 - um examples
48:08 - um and kake in the chat is saying hey i
48:10 - made this project a while ago
48:12 - using deep q learning so deep cue
48:15 - learning is one of my
48:17 - uh i don't know is it white whales is it
48:20 - my
48:20 - windmill that i'm always trying to
48:22 - defeat i don't know what
48:24 - cultural historical uh reference point i
48:27 - should be using here
48:28 - um but i really i i don't it's deep cue
48:31 - learning and q learning is a topic that
48:33 - i have really been hoping to explore and
48:35 - cover
48:36 - and hopefully someday i can get to it
48:38 - and chris writes
48:39 - this feels like the 2021 version of war
48:42 - games
48:44 - great movie by the way i watched ferris
48:46 - bueller with my family recently that was
48:47 - a lot of fun
48:48 - uh okay so let's see um
48:52 - i'm almost halfway through my time and i
48:54 - want to get to some of the coding
48:56 - projects
48:57 - i'm planning to do i also need to take a
49:00 - break
49:01 - and tell you about the brilliant the
49:02 - sponsor of today's live stream
49:05 - um but let's look at let's let me um let
49:08 - me
49:08 - let me constrain myself to looking at
49:11 - two community contributions and the way
49:13 - that i'm going to do that i know we have
49:15 - the wonderful wheel
49:16 - spinner but i'm going to just try seeing
49:19 - today
49:20 - and thank you so much for sharing this
49:23 - on twitter
49:24 - with me i would like to
49:27 - um can close this i'm going to go to the
49:30 - coding train website i'm going to go to
49:31 - the coding challenges
49:33 - and there are currently uh 161 of them
49:37 - so let's go back to discord
49:40 - and uh say random
49:44 - can i give it a range i can't remember
49:46 - if i can give it a range
49:48 - i got a number uh one
49:51 - three seven two one so if i were to just
49:55 - do it uh
49:56 - modulus 161
49:59 - will google do that for me uh 44 oh
50:02 - modulo
50:02 - badger low modulo modulo
50:07 - is the operator modulus is the result of
50:09 - the operation
50:10 - 44. so now we're going to go to coding
50:13 - challenge
50:14 - number 44 it's an oldie
50:19 - um and oh it's a
50:22 - multi-part one oh a fin 111
50:26 - this one's going to be a little wonky
50:28 - i'm actually going to be really
50:29 - surprised if this one has
50:30 - any community contributions uh let's
50:33 - take a look
50:34 - at uh part two
50:38 - and ah there are there are
50:41 - three community contributions well two
50:43 - are by the same person that's no that's
50:45 - uh it still counts as three
50:47 - um and one is called feeling emoji
50:50 - and all ooh i love that title feeling
50:52 - emojian emojianal
50:54 - um mckay is also asking do you think
50:57 - we'll
50:57 - explore ray tracing i would like to i
51:00 - would like to
51:01 - um so let's take a look at a
51:03 - sentiment.js
51:06 - this is i don't know what this is hello
51:09 - okay um i am dan
51:13 - oh okay the coding train
51:16 - is live
51:23 - and happy ah okay
51:26 - so this looks like uh so if i remember
51:29 - correctly
51:30 - what this particular coding challenge
51:32 - demonstrates
51:33 - is a methodology for doing sentiment
51:36 - analysis on a text
51:37 - which uses a pre sort of hard-coded
51:41 - list of words with assigned sentiment
51:43 - scores that were put together if my
51:45 - memory serves me
51:46 - correctly by a group of psychologists
51:49 - um who created this list it's a
51:51 - well-known list
51:52 - called the a-fin 111 and so i
51:56 - presumably what this is is a nice little
51:58 - interface for typing in a sentence
51:59 - and the reason why i might get a score
52:02 - of
52:04 - zero is none of these words the coding
52:06 - train or in the list
52:08 - but if i say happy jovial um
52:12 - sunny day and i got a score of 2.5 maybe
52:16 - it's like an
52:16 - average of the scores of all those words
52:19 - um
52:20 - sad depressed
52:24 - gray day negative 1.67 so you can see
52:27 - you know this is not a a very
52:29 - sophisticated method
52:31 - but it is a mechanism for taking any
52:34 - arbitrary sequence of words and turning
52:37 - it into a numeric score
52:39 - so you can go back and watch that coding
52:41 - challenge thank you for this new
52:42 - interface
52:43 - sam lee and now here's a colorized
52:46 - sentiment score
52:47 - also by sam lee um which ah whoa
52:52 - um i don't know what to do paste text
52:56 - here
52:57 - um happy sunny jovial day
53:04 - do i press this button now and i get the
53:07 - score
53:08 - and oh and look at that it is
53:11 - highlighting the words
53:13 - with probably a sort of brightness level
53:15 - according to what score it got so
53:18 - like for example um let's just go to
53:20 - rainbow
53:21 - on wikipedia and let's
53:25 - copy paste like this text
53:29 - bring it in here press this button
53:32 - wow not a single word
53:36 - is in the aphin 111 dataset that's kind
53:39 - of nuts
53:40 - um interestingly enough it would be it
53:42 - would be interesting to compare this to
53:45 - um
53:51 - uh where's oh sorry learn.mo5js.org
53:54 - to what is in the um
53:58 - the sentiment analysis model in
54:03 - the ml5.js library so this is a
54:06 - particular
54:07 - module in the ml5 library that uses a
54:09 - neural network
54:10 - to take text as an input and output a
54:13 - sentiment score
54:14 - and this particular pre-trained model
54:16 - that's offered with ml5
54:18 - was trained off of movie reviews so i
54:20 - think we could have a very long
54:22 - thorough discussion as to you know what
54:25 - uh what sort of biases and sort of are
54:28 - inherent in using
54:30 - movie reviews as your training set but
54:32 - you need some training data set that has
54:34 - chunks of text with labeled with a
54:37 - sentiment score
54:38 - and so presumably a movie review that's
54:40 - been assigned a score like our star
54:42 - rating
54:43 - that's how you can collect a data set
54:45 - like that without having to manually
54:46 - curate one
54:47 - so i think if i um go here to let's try
54:52 - going to
54:53 - this uh example i hope this works
54:57 - um and let me just change
55:01 - this here so this example uses the movie
55:05 - review
55:06 - model and it scores the sentiment of a
55:08 - text with a value between 0
55:10 - and 1 0 being negative 1 being positive
55:13 - [Music]
55:14 - movie reviews were truncated to a
55:16 - maximum of 200 words and only the most
55:17 - 20 000 most common words in the room
55:19 - so this is very similar but instead of
55:22 - being a sort of
55:23 - hard-coded curated list of words that
55:26 - a sort of so-called trained expert i
55:28 - don't mean that they aren't experts i
55:30 - just think it's like you know
55:31 - who are those people and are why are we
55:34 - entrusting them to
55:35 - assign sentiment scores to language i
55:38 - think that's
55:39 - a complex question uh what's the
55:41 - difference between doing that
55:43 - trust having an expert created list of
55:45 - words versus an
55:46 - automated list of words essentially
55:48 - generated from a neural network based
55:50 - system
55:50 - so let's go um well let's just sort of
55:53 - see
55:54 - you can see we get today is the happiest
55:56 - day and it's full of rainbows
55:57 - is a very high number
56:01 - saddest day and is full of uh
56:04 - [Music]
56:05 - rain storms
56:08 - and clouds
56:14 - uh
56:18 - sad and miserable
56:22 - does that not work cause i got got a
56:24 - very high sentiment score
56:28 - yeah um well i got a different score
56:32 - and let's see if we can make it be
56:34 - negative this is weird something's up
56:35 - something is definitely a miss here
56:39 - um miserable sad annoyed i hate
56:46 - everything and i'm so gosh darned
56:49 - tired angst analysis demo there we go
56:57 - what's it i just curious yeah all right
57:00 - so i'm not sure
57:01 - um
57:05 - yeah i'm not sure what happened there
57:06 - before but we can see that you know with
57:08 - me trying to write
57:10 - very extreme uh sort of sentences that
57:14 - uh in my mind are
57:15 - clearly uh negative
57:18 - versus positive um i'm able to sort of
57:21 - produce some results
57:22 - um this is a very small text box
57:25 - but i'm just curious to see if i can
57:28 - paste
57:28 - this in here and hit submit
57:32 - the rainbow wikipedia page is full
57:35 - of happy positive uh energy and
57:38 - sentiment
57:40 - all right uh we've got one more uh here
57:44 - to uh demonstrate feeling emojinol by
57:47 - chris
57:48 - hall let's take a look at this um
57:51 - and how are you i am
57:55 - okay today it's been
57:58 - a hard year but
58:02 - things are looking up and
58:05 - i'm excited for this summer
58:09 - so this is pretty cool i mean i i like
58:11 - what this is doing
58:14 - um it's looking at my text
58:17 - it's showing me which words have which
58:19 - sentiment score so we can see i'm
58:21 - getting a total
58:22 - of two hard we had a negative score
58:25 - excited had a
58:26 - high positive score and then i guess
58:27 - it's summarizing it
58:30 - uh in with an emoji as well as with kind
58:33 - of some
58:34 - uh text i don't know of how that text is
58:36 - generated picked from a list
58:37 - i don't know if it can only ever be a
58:39 - happy or sad emoji um but i like this
58:42 - idea of almost like a free writing
58:43 - exercise
58:44 - and in real time as you're free writing
58:47 - um you're getting this
58:48 - um feedback on the the web page itself
58:51 - is changing
58:52 - i could imagine doing something that's
58:54 - more abs that's kind of abstract
58:56 - in this vein as you're typing an email
58:58 - even like this would be like a chrome
58:59 - extension you're typing an email in the
59:01 - sort of color scheme of your email
59:03 - editor
59:04 - uh is a browser extension i should say
59:07 - uh is um
59:08 - is changing or could you have something
59:09 - that's like reading the sentiment of
59:11 - your code like code comments
59:13 - that would be kind of interesting um so
59:16 - um so this is great thank you guys see
59:18 - this is this is uh this is bringing me
59:20 - so much happiness today
59:22 - because uh i just love to see the sort
59:24 - of creative possibilities
59:25 - that come out of of many of these
59:27 - examples ah all right hold on
59:30 - a in the chat says i just discovered
59:34 - this channel
59:35 - i am excited but where do i get started
59:38 - well
59:38 - lucky for you i caught your message in
59:40 - the chat and i am here to answer it
59:42 - so um back to the coding train website
59:46 - if coding is brand new to you and you
59:48 - want to explore it through this channel
59:51 - you know to be clear there are many
59:53 - other pathways and possibilities and
59:55 - places
59:56 - for you to explore coding um
60:00 - but um through this channel
60:03 - this particular beginners sorry
60:06 - these playlists are meant for beginners
60:09 - with no experience whatsoever
60:11 - um the p5.js one is probably the most
60:15 - up-to-date one and in fact you can sort
60:19 - of see
60:20 - i'm slowly filling in the gaps of
60:22 - replacing older videos
60:24 - so this is a beginner playlist that i
60:26 - would like to
60:27 - always have available and kind of
60:29 - current and you can see that there are
60:32 - some videos that were made in 2015
60:35 - that are still in this playlist the code
60:37 - for all these videos
60:38 - still works i also look a little bit
60:41 - younger i think my brain is working
60:43 - better
60:43 - as i age you know this different things
60:46 - seem harder for me to
60:47 - figure out but uh so you know i think
60:50 - there's hopefully there's still value in
60:51 - these older videos but um
60:53 - you know i've been able to improve the
60:54 - examples for clarity based on feedback
60:57 - as well as improve some of the
60:58 - production value
60:59 - of the videos so you can see that these
61:01 - are recent ones that are newer that just
61:03 - um you know from uh from february march
61:06 - of this year
61:07 - so next on my list you know it's always
61:10 - this balance of how much do i want to do
61:12 - live streaming
61:13 - versus uh work on the nature of code
61:15 - book or versus work on updating these
61:17 - videos
61:18 - so but i would like by the fall to
61:21 - finish replacing
61:23 - all the way up until i think these um
61:27 - boy a lot any of that were made in 2015
61:30 - so i think the 2017 ones i'll probably
61:32 - keep
61:33 - still but all the 2015 ones i would like
61:36 - to replace
61:37 - by the way if you have feedback i don't
61:38 - know what people think of the new sort
61:40 - of thumbnails
61:41 - um and the new style of the videos but
61:44 - um
61:44 - but yeah so that's where
61:48 - um um that's where you can begin
61:54 - i'm seeing people in the chat requesting
61:56 - to show different contributions and
61:58 - but um i think right now um as it is 11
62:01 - a.m
62:02 - the exact is perfect i spent an hour
62:04 - this is this is how it should be
62:06 - i spent an hour you know it should
62:08 - really be 50 minutes or 55 minutes
62:10 - because i'm gonna take a five minute
62:11 - break
62:14 - i yeah the processing ones are really
62:17 - old
62:18 - um yeah
62:22 - i spent about an hour kind of meandering
62:25 - through
62:26 - showing some contributions talking about
62:27 - the discord bot um i want to work on
62:30 - in the second half of the live stream i
62:33 - want to work
62:34 - on um
62:40 - self 3d self-avoiding walk and and
62:42 - looking at uh bezier curves
62:44 - um so i'm going to take a short break
62:46 - before i take a break
62:48 - i would like to thank uh today's sponsor
62:50 - uh the coding train the engine is kept
62:52 - running by the sponsors of the go to
62:54 - drain
62:54 - built this thing up that has a lot of
62:56 - components and a lot of pieces
62:58 - and i'm really thankful to have uh
63:01 - partners oh and
63:02 - ahmer super chat is coming in this also
63:04 - helps keep the engine running
63:06 - uh uh have friends from the different
63:09 - sponsors who are able to support the
63:10 - work that i'm doing
63:11 - um if you like learning stuff on the
63:13 - coding train
63:15 - if you also like having mugs i just
63:17 - switch over here to this view
63:19 - with uh geometry formulas on them this
63:21 - is one side of my mug
63:23 - you know you know what's better than
63:25 - learning some geometry formulas from
63:26 - your
63:27 - mug of tea or coffee or warm water with
63:30 - lemon
63:30 - as my grandmother used to like to make
63:33 - um i think it was called
63:35 - uh yiddish it's like vasa mcmillan
63:38 - anybody who knows yiddish what does that
63:39 - mean is that like with milk in it i'm
63:41 - not sure it's like these things are
63:42 - popping into my mind
63:44 - um but brilliant is really um
63:48 - a website and uh app that i think you
63:51 - will
63:51 - um particularly particularly love it has
63:55 - um so what do i do i talk ramble
63:58 - incessantly um and demonstrate stuff but
64:01 - really
64:02 - for me the way that i learn most
64:03 - effectively is through trying things on
64:05 - my own
64:06 - and so brilliant is really a website
64:07 - that's all about uh and
64:09 - an app all about trying things on uh for
64:12 - your own interactive courses
64:13 - daily challenges um and just the the
64:16 - topics like if i go to the courses page
64:19 - um you know this is like i just go ah
64:21 - well i just want to gobble it all up
64:23 - because it's all of the topics
64:24 - that i really love it's got stuff for
64:26 - all ages um
64:27 - you know two courses that i would like
64:29 - to highlight for you
64:30 - one is the um
64:35 - fundam program with python course so i i
64:38 - like to highlight this one because i
64:40 - um program with javascript and a lot of
64:43 - get a lot of requests about learning
64:44 - python
64:45 - and this would be a great one to explore
64:48 - the basics of programming with a
64:49 - different language for you
64:51 - this course called geometry fundamentals
64:53 - has some really amazing uh
64:55 - visual animations um that demonstrate
64:58 - core concepts in
64:59 - in math and geometry honestly one of the
65:02 - reasons why i love it so much
65:04 - is my mic still working it's like
65:06 - disappeared from my screen it is um one
65:08 - of the reasons why i love this course so
65:09 - much is that
65:10 - um it gives me a lot of ideas of like
65:12 - visual things that i want to make
65:14 - um coming back to uh here um like this
65:18 - beautiful geometry course
65:20 - um i'm uh it's just like really amazing
65:22 - i'm gonna hit continue
65:24 - um and you can see here i'm in lesson
65:26 - two uh i got this one right i guess
65:29 - at some point i'm gonna go on next well
65:31 - i'm a little bit afraid so
65:32 - the end the answer to the prior problem
65:34 - we found that a progressive series
65:36 - of similar l shapes each with a red
65:37 - portion of one third and use that
65:39 - to derive the fact that the entire large
65:41 - square has a red portion of one third
65:43 - it's kind of like these infinite series
65:45 - are super interesting
65:46 - another approach is take each red square
65:49 - and make two
65:50 - copies one to the right of the square
65:52 - being copied and one to the one below
65:54 - so this shows that in purple oh
65:58 - interesting and this method of covering
66:00 - the overall large square leads to two
66:02 - purple squares for every one red square
66:05 - this again moment of realization this
66:08 - leads to the red area being one third of
66:10 - the overall square
66:12 - um so you can go through and uh it's
66:14 - going to give me oh no
66:15 - no i gotta work on this one now okay
66:19 - uh so like at your your instinct would
66:23 - be like
66:23 - three-fourths right because
66:26 - one two three and then
66:29 - the blue circle you know there's four
66:31 - sections but this blue
66:33 - circle has a yellow one let's think
66:36 - about this
66:39 - are we at four
66:43 - so it's more than three three-fourths
66:46 - right so we can eliminate three-fifths
66:49 - which is less than three-fourths i kind
66:51 - of want to do that purple thing
66:53 - how did that purple thing go where for
66:56 - every red square we put two blue squares
67:01 - so for every
67:05 - but there's no for every oh each one of
67:07 - these is
67:09 - four so for every four
67:13 - 8 12 yellow squares
67:17 - i can color three blue squares
67:24 - so 12 out of 15
67:27 - which is four-fifths did i get that
67:31 - right
67:33 - i got it right oh my god
67:37 - oh that was so exciting oh wait wait
67:39 - wait i don't want to go back
67:41 - go back um what i love about this is
67:43 - then i go to the show explanation
67:46 - and um yeah it did this is what i did in
67:49 - my head
67:50 - uh 12 and then three um
67:53 - awesome which reduces to four fifths oh
67:55 - this is so fun
67:56 - so um if you are interested in this

68:17 - 20 off okay um i
68:20 - am going to now um so thank you again to
68:23 - brilliant
68:24 - um i am going to take a short uh
68:26 - hopefully just like two or three minute
68:28 - break
68:28 - just to grab some water uh do a 30
68:31 - second meditation
68:33 - and come back to look at something
68:35 - called a self-avoiding walk
68:37 - and extending that into 3d and hopefully
68:40 - by next week the actual it's about a
68:42 - 35 to 40 minute coding challenge video
68:44 - building
68:45 - the entire self-avoiding walk okay uh
68:48 - see you all in about
68:49 - two or three minutes
68:55 - and i'm muting my microphone here i'll
68:57 - be right back
69:07 - [Music]
69:20 - [Music]
69:46 - so
69:54 - [Music]
70:05 - [Music]
70:28 - do
70:35 - [Music]
70:42 - so
70:46 - [Music]
71:02 - [Applause]
71:04 - [Music]
71:24 - do
71:31 - [Music]
71:50 - all right i am back um i see folks in
71:54 - the uh
71:55 - chat are asking a very common frequently
71:57 - asked question which is what is the
71:59 - music that i'm playing
72:00 - uh this is a song it's called tori the
72:03 - dog
72:04 - i have no idea why it's called that is
72:06 - by a composer named adam blau
72:08 - who is a film and tv uh composer based
72:12 - in
72:12 - los angeles i think you can find um him
72:15 - on twitter
72:16 - um adam blau i think he has a website
72:18 - adam blough.com
72:20 - adam blau is a friend of mine from my
72:22 - old bright college
72:24 - years okay thank uh
72:28 - offered up this uh track that he had
72:30 - written that doesn't get used anywhere
72:31 - else for me to use
72:33 - um all right so what's happening now
72:35 - we're actually going to do
72:36 - some coding uh thanks again to the
72:38 - sponsor of today brilliant
72:40 - um so what are you looking at here this
72:43 - is
72:44 - remember i spent all this time talking
72:46 - about random walks
72:47 - and the uh new coding train discord bot
72:50 - earlier
72:52 - and the next coding challenge that will
72:54 - be released on the channel is
72:55 - programming exactly this
72:57 - and i know this is a little bit
72:58 - unfortunate the way things are working
73:00 - for me these days where i'm covering
73:02 - additional things from the
73:05 - uh coding challenge on a live stream
73:08 - when the coding challenge hasn't yet
73:09 - been released but
73:11 - that's the way it works right now um so
73:14 - this is the code
73:15 - that the challenge ends now what what
73:17 - you can see about what's different about
73:19 - a self-avoiding walk
73:20 - is it's making a random decision every
73:22 - frame to move up down left or right
73:25 - but it's never allowed to step into a
73:27 - position where it has been before
73:30 - so we you might be able to see this a
73:31 - bit more uh clearly
73:33 - as if i started over and you can see one
73:36 - of the things that i've built into this
73:37 - example is if it ends up somewhere where
73:39 - it is stuck
73:40 - and has nowhere to go it will backtrack
73:43 - and try a different route so this is i i
73:46 - think this is a beautiful
73:47 - um um a beautiful
73:52 - an algorithm that has beautiful results
73:54 - um i i kind of hypnotized by it i could
73:56 - kind of watch it all day
73:57 - i think there's a lot of probably this
73:59 - is just a very literal basic
74:01 - visualization of it i think there's a
74:03 - lot of possibilities of what you could
74:04 - do to explore this
74:06 - um on a live stream a while ago i think
74:08 - i did this with
74:09 - you know some curves and started to make
74:11 - these different patterns from it
74:13 - but what i uh would like to
74:16 - demonstrate in the video is
74:20 - what it looks like if it's in 3d so
74:23 - you know time box myself here maybe just
74:25 - give me myself 20 25 minutes
74:29 - to see um uh how that works now i just
74:32 - realized
74:34 - that i need a three okay so first of all
74:36 - let me duplicate i already duplicated
74:38 - this
74:39 - uh so let's say three you know what
74:42 - i wanna first see like how do i even
74:44 - render this
74:45 - in 3d so first of all if i say webgl
74:51 - great okay so that's excellent now can i
74:55 - in draw say orbit is it
74:58 - do i say orbit controls orbit control
75:04 - there's a uh oh there we go
75:08 - so there's a function in p5 look at that
75:10 - that is wild
75:11 - that is so cool so even just doing this
75:14 - and
75:14 - i think i oh and you know my font is so
75:16 - tiny sorry about that
75:21 - um let's now let's give myself a little
75:24 - bit more space
75:29 - and i can zoom in ah
75:34 - hold on
75:38 - i don't know why this orbit controls
75:40 - thing there we go it's just very
75:43 - do i not yeah it works it's just kind of
75:45 - like
75:46 - a little wonky um all right so now now
75:50 - that that works
75:52 - uh and maybe what i would like to do is
75:55 - have
75:56 - the spacing be a little bit bigger so
75:59 - that way also it's a little bigger okay
76:02 - um so i can sort of see this whoa it
76:04 - moving
76:05 - closer all right so now what i would
76:07 - like to do
76:09 - is
76:12 - change this to make
76:15 - 3d array columns rows
76:18 - what's the word for
76:22 - the in a 3d grid
76:26 - i mean columns rows i mean it's really
76:28 - just x
76:30 - the three different axes
76:34 - uh i i was to say like zoll's
76:44 - i wanted to make a um
76:47 - zowls okay columns rows
76:50 - and i'm officially calling them zowls
76:53 - [Laughter]
76:55 - uh layers depths depth i realize it's
76:58 - depth but okay i'm fine
77:00 - uh not we'll call it depth so
77:03 - for every column we have a certain
77:07 - number of
77:08 - rows
77:11 - and for every
77:17 - then four and this should for
77:23 - every
77:27 - element of for every
77:32 - row
77:35 - i mean this is like a crazy way to make
77:37 - a three-dimensional array in javascript
77:38 - but it's just
77:40 - the way i know how uh
77:48 - is this right i think this is right
77:52 - um we can do a nice console log table
77:55 - so we're gonna make a 3d array columns
77:59 - rows
78:00 - depth and i'm just going to say
78:04 - depth is the same as the number of
78:06 - columns
78:08 - and let's let's test this out orbit
78:11 - control
78:12 - let's test this out so i'm just opening
78:14 - up the console here
78:16 - because if i say make 3d array
78:20 - 10 10 10.
78:23 - was it not called that oh i have to run
78:27 - it
78:27 - oh unexpected token
78:30 - but we have an extra parenthesis there
78:34 - okay it's running let's go
78:37 - back to here
78:41 - okay that works so um
78:50 - three let's make it three by three by
78:52 - three
78:55 - let's just test it
78:59 - let's look at that so it's got an array
79:03 - of three arrays
79:04 - and each array of three arrays has three
79:07 - things in it
79:08 - empty times three that makes sense can i
79:11 - do like console.table
79:16 - um test
79:20 - yeah so this makes sense because it is a
79:23 - 2d array with each spot having an array
79:26 - in it
79:27 - okay so that's good
79:30 - i think the only thing okay so now what
79:33 - else do i need to change
79:36 - and can i give myself a little bit more
79:38 - room here
79:41 - i guess i shouldn't have made it uh 800
79:43 - by 800.
79:48 - let's do that and then do you know as i
79:51 - obsessively try to have the right amount
79:53 - of space here
79:54 - okay so now um we've got a 3d array
79:59 - the spot is zero zero zero
80:05 - um return is valid
80:08 - i j k everything's got to have a third
80:12 - element to it uh oh
80:17 - k k plus plus
80:21 - k is less than depth
80:24 - i j k spot i j
80:27 - k i'm just kind of let me hit
80:31 - stop here and turn auto refresh off
80:33 - please
80:34 - i just want everything that was
80:36 - previously
80:37 - in two dimensions to switch
80:40 - to being three
80:43 - all right what else do i got here is
80:46 - valid
80:47 - all right and then also
80:50 - check if k is less than zero
80:55 - k is greater than or equal to depth that
80:57 - would be off
80:58 - the grid okay translate i don't really
81:02 - need to worry about that
81:04 - spot is next spot path
81:08 - path length college uh if you've hit
81:11 - every spot uh
81:15 - spot.z spot.z
81:19 - okay now where's my spot class
81:23 - needs to have a dz
81:30 - and then all of the steps now there's a
81:33 - lot more possibilities
81:39 - for all of the possible steps that it
81:42 - could take
81:44 - wow if i did a good job writing this
81:45 - code the original code
81:47 - extending it into 3d is going to be as
81:49 - easy as what i'm doing right now
81:52 - which i don't know if that's really the
81:53 - case but we're about to find out
81:56 - okay uh i j k
82:02 - uh the z is and i realized this would
82:06 - make a lot more sense if you had all
82:07 - just watched
82:08 - the video where i built this all options
82:11 - all options
82:13 - new x
82:17 - new z
82:23 - is valid new x new y new z
82:29 - um
82:34 - okay grid uh we need the
82:37 - z component which is k plus dz
82:44 - is that really everything what's the
82:46 - chance that i did this right
82:48 - very little
82:51 - oh my goodness i think it's actually
82:53 - kind of doing it
83:00 - it seems to not be moving along the z
83:02 - very much though i mean it did
83:28 - like why why did it go why is it
83:31 - sticking within a sort of
83:32 - current plane the second dx should be
83:35 - negative one
83:41 - in the step constructor
83:49 - i think i got it right
83:54 - hold on
83:57 - it's kind of staying within one
84:00 - plane line 13. oh
84:05 - thank you
84:08 - that i couldn't see
84:15 - there we go wild
84:21 - wow that is wild
84:25 - what why did i just do that in like 10
84:28 - minutes
84:33 - i mean visually this could be vastly
84:36 - improved
84:43 - i'm trying to think if there's anything
84:44 - i could do right now just to sort of
84:46 - visually improve it
84:47 - so one thing is i feel like the line
84:51 - thickness is a very thick
84:56 - so
84:59 - um let's let's make it
85:02 - thinner and
85:06 - maybe what i want to do is actually not
85:08 - use orbit control
85:11 - but translate
85:21 - i'm putting where it starts in the
85:22 - center but it can't go
85:24 - negatively so what if i actually have it
85:26 - start
85:27 - at um
85:33 - like what's the center
85:37 - center x equals uh columns divided by
85:42 - it's the same for all of them so columns
85:45 - divided by
85:47 - uh 2 but make sure i
85:50 - floor it and then uh
85:54 - let's just reuse that so i'm gonna have
85:57 - it start in the center
86:01 - um and
86:04 - let's just make sure that works
86:11 - what did i just do
86:17 - um but now i want to translate oh whoa
86:19 - that's weird but now i don't want to
86:25 - translate it anywhere
86:29 - or no i want to translate it by negative
86:42 - i want to translate it
86:46 - you know what let me put orbit controls
86:49 - back
86:49 - in wait i i want it to
86:53 - starting in the center of the grid which
86:55 - i want
86:56 - oh no spacing times
87:00 - columns negative spacing times rows
87:04 - negative spacing times depth
87:10 - there we go this is what i want i want
87:13 - it to start
87:14 - in the center but be able to go in all
87:15 - directions
87:17 - do i have orbit control in so now there
87:19 - we go i wanted to be able to kind of
87:21 - move around it
87:24 - can you fade it darker the further away
87:26 - from the camera yeah
87:30 - are we breaking yes is this what was
87:32 - that called like the tubes
87:34 - that old uh win3 this old screensaver
87:37 - am i am i just remaking that what was it
87:39 - was it like
87:44 - is this what it was called pipes pipes
87:50 - i did not realize i just made this
87:56 - all right let's what's the so yeah i'm
88:00 - totally
88:01 - basically making this
88:05 - amazing amazing all right but uh
88:08 - i have to visually think about the
88:10 - design of this
88:12 - a bit more but i wanted to do a couple
88:14 - things
88:15 - one is what if i take out orbit controls
88:19 - and just do like rotate
88:22 - x frame count times
88:26 - 0.01 or something
88:30 - so it's always going to whoa
88:37 - that's a little bit weird and
88:40 - let's try rotating y
88:45 - more slowly okay
88:48 - okay so this
88:52 - i'm enjoying
88:57 - and what can i do is there anything i
88:59 - can do just sort of visually right now
89:04 - yeah i kind of wanted to make it thinner
89:06 - there we go
89:14 - so here we go this is what i will
89:17 - capture give each walker a i want to
89:19 - start multiple ones
89:21 - give them different colors so this is
89:23 - what um oh
89:25 - um this is what i would like i just
89:28 - this is enough for me right now i just
89:29 - wanted to be able to demonstrate
89:32 - um
89:35 - to demonstrate the core idea and so i
89:38 - have now a visual thing i can render
89:40 - for um making it in through in 3d yeah
89:45 - yep i could write i could take the
89:48 - rgb so first of all let me grab this
89:51 - code
89:53 - and i want to go to discord
89:56 - and ah random max between zero thank you
90:00 - and i'm going to go to
90:03 - links so i this is where i will
90:06 - typically paste
90:07 - links to things that i'm doing in the
90:09 - live stream somebody is welcome to paste
90:11 - this into the youtube chat i just don't
90:13 - have that open right now
90:14 - but um so that's where you can find the
90:16 - link to this code right now
90:18 - um but i think this is good enough like
90:22 - this
90:23 - this is what i want to capture that
90:26 - video this is the last piece for this
90:28 - video to come out
90:28 - any questions translate to center before
90:32 - rotating so it stays in perspective
90:34 - so in theory it's it is translated
90:38 - to the center of
90:42 - this particular
90:49 - kind of cube that it is going to try to
90:51 - fill
90:52 - um based on this translation
90:58 - but i believe that it is appears that
91:00 - it's not staying in our perspective
91:03 - because it randomly chose to go in one
91:06 - direction at the beginning
91:07 - and never came back to go the other way
91:10 - so
91:10 - i could dynamically translate to
91:14 - like do something interesting of like
91:16 - where it currently is
91:18 - like this would be a little bit crazy
91:20 - like what if i said
91:22 - um translate
91:26 - to um negative spot dot x
91:31 - negative spot dot y negative spot dot z
91:35 - like i think this would make it i mean
91:38 - it's it's very jarring but it's
91:40 - following
91:40 - the current spot whoa
91:44 - i could okay wait i got i got it now i
91:46 - can't
91:47 - uh let lerp x lerp
91:50 - y lerp z
91:54 - um how do i have them all equal zero is
91:57 - there a way to declare
91:58 - three variables all at once where they
91:59 - all equal zero
92:02 - that's not just this
92:05 - uh
92:10 - okay um
92:14 - so what i want to do is say lerpx equals
92:18 - lerp
92:19 - lerp lerp x spot
92:23 - dot x ooh stallion that's way too
92:25 - jarring for me
92:26 - um so if i want to move towards the spot
92:30 - i want to go just like a small
92:32 - percentage of the way there
92:33 - so let's say 0.1 let's call that amount
92:40 - and let's do that for y
92:44 - z
92:49 - and then negative lerp x
92:52 - lerp y lerp z this should now
92:55 - more smoothly follow it oops negative
93:00 - and one more negative let's see if this
93:06 - works
93:11 - right you can see that it's a bit more
93:12 - smooth let's make the amount
93:14 - like really literally less
93:18 - there we go it's kind of cool so it's
93:21 - like an automated sort of
93:22 - camera that's trying to
93:26 - why is it moving further away though it
93:29 - should be
93:29 - staying close to it
93:34 - maybe that's just the lurping is slow
93:43 - it's kind of interesting though i mean i
93:45 - don't know
93:46 - if i like what happens if i take the
93:47 - rotate out
93:56 - very strange so there's probably
94:02 - there's there's probably a uh
94:05 - a different way to do this that would be
94:08 - uh interesting in terms of following the
94:10 - camera but this is kind of a quick
94:13 - demonstration that i have right now i
94:14 - kind of love it actually
94:18 - but i want to look at bezier curves
94:26 - the rotation is around the wrong anchor
94:28 - point i know right
94:30 - well i'm not rotating now
94:34 - um
94:42 - but now i am
94:46 - what if i do rotate z
94:50 - so it's just kind of spinning
94:55 - move the rotate above the translator all
94:57 - right all right
95:12 - yeah focus on the center work out the
95:14 - center from the minimum x to the minimum
95:16 - y yeah there's so many ways that this
95:18 - could be done
95:19 - but focusing on the center would be a
95:21 - very good idea
95:22 - uh capture the maximum x y and z and
95:25 - center on their midpoints i'm going to
95:27 - leave that as an exercise
95:28 - to the viewer although i kind of to be
95:31 - honest
95:33 - that actually okay can i allow myself
95:35 - five more minutes to do that
95:42 - let's use p5 vector
95:48 - um so i need
95:59 - min x min xyz
96:09 - max xyz so
96:12 - for let v of path
96:16 - and then i would say min x y z
96:19 - equals um
96:21 - [Music]
96:23 - or spot of path like oh no let
96:26 - but yeah i'll just say v it's fine min x
96:29 - y z
96:30 - equals the minimum whichever one is
96:33 - smaller of
96:34 - v dot x and itself
96:39 - minx y z dot x
96:44 - min x y z dot y min
96:47 - x y z dot z so this is getting the
96:50 - minimum
96:51 - xyz
96:55 - then the maximum
97:00 - should be the max function
97:04 - whichever one is bigger
97:07 - between the x the y the z and the max
97:14 - then center dot
97:18 - x equals
97:21 - min x y z i kind of want to just call
97:25 - these min v
97:26 - no but it's not really that because min
97:29 - x y z of
97:31 - max x y z dot x
97:36 - minus min x y z dot x
97:44 - times zero half of that plus the minimum
97:50 - is that right center dot x
97:54 - is the maximum minus the minimum that's
97:57 - the
97:58 - the range half of the range offset from
98:00 - the minimum
98:04 - y z
98:08 - y z y z
98:12 - y z oh wait a sec
98:16 - the maximum the minimum can't be zero
98:19 - it'll always be zero
98:23 - so the minimum has to start at like
98:28 - infinity
98:30 - um and it's the minimum oh dot x
98:34 - dot y dot z dot x
98:39 - dot y dot z
98:42 - and now what happens if let's get rid of
98:45 - the rotation
98:46 - what if i do translate negative center x
98:51 - negative center y negative center z
98:56 - and i might want to lerp those but hold
98:58 - on
99:00 - missing parentheses oops here
99:11 - yeah look at that that is wild
99:24 - okay let's put the alert back in this is
99:26 - this is really cool
99:28 - uh let's put the alert back in
99:32 - uh where is that lerp lerp lerp
99:35 - so this should be center dot x no no
99:38 - center dot x center dot y center dot z
99:45 - and let's yeah that's fine and then
99:49 - uh lerp
99:52 - x lerp y
99:57 - lerp z okay here we go everybody
100:11 - so it's interesting i i was i would have
100:13 - might be done the average location but i
100:15 - like this minimum and maximum because
100:16 - it's sort of like
100:17 - panning now the question is should i add
100:21 - some rotation
100:25 - like is that interesting
100:28 - to also see it rotate
100:32 - i feel like i would like to see it
100:33 - rotate around the y axis
100:35 - is kind of what i'm expecting to see
100:47 - it's why is it rotate away the rotation
100:53 - am i just wrong about the way that i'm
100:55 - thinking about this and the rotation
100:57 - really should be before the translation
101:00 - maybe yeah this is what i meant
101:04 - to do i don't understand why the
101:06 - rotation should be before that's like
101:08 - backwards the way i think about it
101:11 - but this is great if i don't say so
101:14 - myself
101:17 - uh
101:22 - um let me see here what else is
101:25 - happening
101:29 - um all right now can is this the pipes
101:32 - screensaver
101:33 - apparently it is it was not my intention
101:36 - i probably should brand this like redo
101:38 - the coding challenge as
101:41 - windows pipes screensaver and that would
101:43 - be good clickbait
101:47 - let me just see now if i can
101:50 - do something kind of nice
101:54 - which is make this window width
101:59 - window height
102:02 - file share and get
102:05 - this we hit stop i'll share
102:09 - and get this view
102:19 - view enter full screen
102:25 - and here we are everybody let's just
102:28 - enjoy this for a little bit
102:39 - this is a self-avoiding walk
102:42 - in three dimensions people really want
102:44 - me to add color
102:45 - [Laughter]
102:50 - but i want to look at bezier curves
102:52 - today i only have 20 minutes left oh the
102:56 - live
102:56 - poll i forgot about the live
103:00 - poll all right i have no idea if the
103:03 - live poll is gonna work
103:05 - but there's been so many um
103:10 - uh music please i don't know i don't
103:12 - really got any uh
103:29 - [Music]
103:49 - okay i'm still here by the way all right
103:52 - let's add color
103:53 - [Music]
103:55 - bessie by the way uh for all of you um
103:58 - [Music]
104:00 - we're wondering when is the next live
104:01 - stream it's tomorrow
104:04 - so i can do the bezier curve stuff i
104:07 - want to do tomorrow
104:09 - um let's add some color okay so what's
104:12 - going to be the best way to do this
104:15 - all right let's try um
104:20 - where am i i don't think though
104:24 - um i have to change the way that i'm
104:27 - drawing it
104:29 - because um
104:33 - unfortunately i'm drawing it as one
104:34 - continuous line
104:38 - and um raycasting coding challenge of
104:42 - the infamous maze from windows 98 would
104:45 - be a nice next step
104:47 - that's a great suggestion cola games a
104:49 - random walk with bezier curves
104:51 - oh that is such a good idea tomorrow so
104:54 - i'm live streaming tomorrow around 2 p.m
104:55 - eastern
104:57 - um you know i'm kind of cramming in oh
104:59 - i've committed to doing a bunch of live
105:01 - streams this
105:02 - month but i didn't get to them so i'm
105:03 - cramming them in at the end
105:05 - so i'm doing another one tomorrow but
105:07 - let's see i think what i would need to
105:09 - do
105:10 - is draw them as individual lines
105:13 - so let me just try something first real
105:16 - quick which is
105:26 - v1 is path index i
105:29 - v two is path index i
105:33 - plus one and then if i'm drawing a line
105:37 - from v
105:37 - one dot x v one dot y
105:40 - v one dot z
105:49 - uh dot y d2 dot z
105:54 - is this the same result yeah
105:57 - okay great so now i can do individual
105:59 - colors
106:00 - because i can take
106:05 - um i have a crazy idea here i should
106:07 - probably do hue
106:12 - maybe i should just do it as um
106:17 - just using hsb mode well the way i was
106:20 - going to do it since we have x y z
106:23 - is r is map v one v1.x
106:27 - which goes between 0 and the number of
106:30 - columns
106:32 - to between 0 and 255.
106:36 - let's just try this real quick g b
106:42 - uh and so i think someone said layers
106:44 - could be instead of depth
106:46 - it could be a good idea uh stroke rgb
106:50 - let's just try this
106:56 - there's some colors appearing here
107:00 - what did i miss v1 xyz
107:04 - zero column
107:21 - what am i missing here
107:26 - oh i could do map the path dot
107:29 - length distance from the center
107:34 - interesting uh yes
107:37 - okay wait why are the most of them just
107:43 - oh it's x x
107:47 - there we go this is what i need to do
107:51 - there we go so this is
107:54 - uh a different way of doing it
107:59 - let's take a look at how this looks and
108:01 - i wonder if actually i should have a
108:03 - minimum amount of
108:04 - color
108:07 - for each just to sort of enforce
108:10 - some amount of brightness and now let's
108:12 - hit save
108:14 - let's go to here see the full screen
108:17 - version
108:19 - cola game says i forgot to add that i
108:21 - could never thank you enough for getting
108:22 - me interested in programming literally
108:24 - shaped the course of my life oh that's
108:26 - so nice
108:27 - thank you
108:30 - uh your passion for what you do is
108:31 - amazing yeah all of the coordinates are
108:33 - positive
108:34 - so this was kind of a nice um idea
108:37 - of a way of doing it and um but i do
108:40 - think that cycling the
108:43 - hue along the path is maybe a nicer way
108:47 - of doing it
108:48 - so this is a
108:51 - different way of doing it would be so
108:53 - that's one way
108:56 - let's say let me comment this out too
108:58 - let me say a
109:00 - color mode hsb
109:03 - so now what if i say uh stroke
109:07 - i modulus 360 that's the hue
109:12 - and then just have these max out at 100.
109:18 - oh i still need these two points
109:23 - yeah i think this is what people were
109:24 - looking for
109:27 - uh so let's see this
109:34 - what happened here
109:43 - there we go
109:47 - so this i think is what folks were
109:49 - looking for this definitely works better
109:52 - in terms of being ridiculously colorful
109:55 - self-avoiding walk but i i i can do
109:58 - i could do you one better here
110:02 - let's add the frame count
110:10 - so now it is also psych
110:15 - the frame count gets added before i take
110:19 - the modulus
110:27 - and now is the cycling too
110:31 - fast do you even notice it does anybody
110:33 - care
110:37 - i like this i mean i could make it
110:40 - i always thought i could make it like
110:42 - more extreme
110:46 - very blinky let's just do it by two
110:58 - i don't know maybe the softness slowness
111:00 - of it is fine
111:02 - um all right ready here we go
111:09 - we are finishing today's live stream
111:14 - with this
111:20 - self-avoiding walk is it possible to
111:24 - make the lines
111:25 - thicker yeah i was making them thinner
111:27 - on purpose but yeah i can try that
111:35 - did i just close the other the code no
111:38 - it's just in another tab
111:40 - let's we can make the we can go back to
111:42 - what i had before
111:49 - i think that took are they thicker
111:52 - [Music]
111:55 - oh no that's for the point
111:58 - [Music]
112:00 - where's the stroke weight there it is
112:06 - [Music]
112:12 - [Music]
112:14 - the problem is um you can see there's a
112:18 - flaw
112:19 - at the end
112:30 - well this is a nice place to wrap up
112:33 - today's live stream
112:35 - with my 3d self-avoiding walk
112:39 - rainbow rainbow colored self-avoiding
112:44 - [Music]
112:51 - god this is bringing me enormous joy
112:58 - i don't need to be in the image here
113:13 - [Music]
113:22 - i don't know if that music really went
113:23 - with let's see what a little music do i
113:25 - have
113:33 - i forgot that does really work
113:48 - this kind of works
114:03 - [Applause]
114:06 - so
114:09 - the drawing nicole says if the drawing
114:11 - point was also
114:13 - a specular light could look pretty cool
114:18 - that would be kind of amazing all right
114:21 - um i'm i'm
114:22 - wrapping this up i'm i'm a little
114:23 - disappointed in myself now because
114:26 - um the the coding challenge definitely
114:29 - like if
114:30 - this were the end result of the coding
114:31 - challenge i mean i could record
114:34 - another like five minutes of extending
114:36 - it into 3d
114:38 - um but um i think i should just let it
114:42 - let it be
114:43 - um but like i love the idea of branding
114:48 - this coding challenge as the windows
114:49 - pipes
114:50 - screensaver
114:54 - yeah it would definitely that would
114:56 - definitely help
114:57 - its uh youtube popularity i'll have to
115:00 - think about that
115:01 - i have to think about whether i have
115:02 - that
115:04 - uh yeah it's so uh um alex is in the
115:07 - chat is pointing it's slowing down a bit
115:09 - so you know this
115:12 - uh this is a limitation of
115:16 - you know javascript canvas and
115:20 - the number of vertices that i'm drawing
115:22 - for all of these lines
115:24 - um we don't know if there would be
115:29 - i'm sure there are some efficiencies
115:30 - that could be added here or
115:33 - geometry that could be saved and
115:36 - in a way that it gets rendered more in
115:39 - an optimized way because it's not
115:41 - those points aren't moving although
115:47 - my five minutes left in my allocated
115:50 - amount of time
115:50 - trying to be good about just streaming
115:52 - for two hours the poll is forgotten yeah
115:54 - i'll have to come back for the poll
115:55 - tomorrow
115:56 - i just went ahead and um but one idea
115:59 - that i kind of have
116:02 - just out of curiosity
116:07 - oh no no that won't yeah actually it
116:09 - will
116:10 - um what if i did something crazy
116:19 - and just like jiggled all the points oh
116:21 - yeah that is
116:22 - [Laughter]
116:25 - i mean i
116:29 - i don't know what i expected to happen
116:31 - there but that's really kind of nuts
116:35 - yeah i should be using something more
116:37 - like
116:39 - thoughtful in terms of uh
116:43 - uh and like maybe
116:50 - what's interesting is i'm storing all
116:52 - the xy positions of all these points
116:54 - separately from where they are in the
116:56 - array so
116:58 - there's not really any reason why it
116:59 - couldn't over time
117:01 - [Music]
117:03 - kind of disintegrate and get a little
117:05 - bit more like look at it's kind of
117:08 - getting wonky as we go
117:17 - um it probably would make more sense for
117:19 - me to use a particular algorithm that
117:21 - retained
117:23 - a displacement from its original but i
117:25 - like the idea of it being less
117:28 - kind of exact and actually maybe that's
117:30 - maybe instead of
117:32 - moving it randomly i should just offset
117:34 - them a little bit
117:36 - like so in other words
117:40 - like what if actually instead of doing
117:42 - that in the actual
117:44 - spot class when i make
117:47 - the x position
117:52 - like what if i just say plus
117:57 - offset based on the spacing
118:00 - so it will be in a regular grid
118:03 - visually still the data still retains
118:06 - its that's too much i suppose
118:16 - i cannot stop i need a time
118:20 - limit which i am now down to three
118:22 - minutes left
118:26 - still too much
118:31 - yeah this is kind of more what i'm
118:32 - looking for
118:39 - maybe not enough
118:48 - yeah so this is interesting so let me
118:50 - just let's let's go look at this in the
118:51 - full screen one
118:57 - so this is just adding a little bit of
118:58 - noise so that it kind of
119:01 - looks perhaps a little bit more sketched
119:08 - um you know i think that's sort of an
119:10 - interesting
119:11 - uh twist on this um it still is very
119:15 - blocky
119:16 - you know i could certainly try to make
119:17 - it more like curved lines
119:20 - but i kind of like this um adding a
119:22 - little
119:23 - uh mess to it all right i'm gonna see uh
119:26 - so
119:26 - so by the way um please join the discord
119:30 - and try out all of the discord bot stuff
119:33 - um message um message us and give us
119:36 - feedback
119:37 - about how to improve that um it's not
119:40 - windows xp
119:40 - now anymore um i will be um
119:44 - back tomorrow if you can believe that uh
119:47 - my goal
119:47 - i haven't i didn't i didn't set the time
119:50 - yet but it's um
119:51 - i have stuff in the morning so probably
119:53 - around 2 p.m eastern also for about
119:56 - two hours
119:59 - and yes cat king writes uh in the chat
120:04 - um breaking news
120:08 - coding train releases a copyright disco
120:11 - sensation that's gripping our nation
120:13 - um but yeah let's look at seeing if we
120:15 - can add bezier curves to this tomorrow
120:17 - and see what we get um thank you
120:20 - everyone for joining today
120:22 - um i have this little uh goodbye
120:26 - song that's about three minutes long
120:30 - so i'm gonna set this to full screen
120:36 - and refresh the page and
120:40 - ethan asks and answers some questions
120:42 - why don't you update your macbook to big
120:44 - sir
120:45 - i'm afraid too should i do that
120:49 - couldn't hurt uh did you try the new
120:52 - slash commands i have not tried the new
120:54 - slash commands yet
120:56 - but i do intend to do so at some point
120:59 - soon
121:01 - um cat king says bye
121:04 - bye to you as well uh just a quick
121:08 - uh shout out thank you to today's
121:10 - sponsor brilliant.org
121:12 - codingtrain you can sign up for free
121:14 - there i don't know is there a course or
121:16 - puzzle that has
121:17 - that is related to the this uh 3d
121:20 - self-avoiding walk i'd love to know
121:23 - mutate the xyz while drawing every frame
121:26 - so over time it would disintegrate with
121:28 - the cumulative effect
121:29 - yes that's what i started with but it
121:31 - became too
121:33 - disintegrated what would be really cool
121:35 - is to add spring forces between them
121:37 - so they could kind of like uh like add a
121:40 - spring force between like where it's
121:42 - supposed to be
121:43 - and it's offset so they could kind of
121:45 - jiggle but always
121:46 - spring back into place that might be
121:48 - interesting
121:50 - um after today's news i'm quite glad
121:53 - that i didn't buy an
121:53 - m1 says julian i don't know what today's
121:56 - news is i don't have to fill me in on
121:58 - that
121:59 - um we will need a processing conversion
122:01 - if we're adding curves to this
122:04 - yeah so i definitely would like to make
122:05 - a processing version of this that
122:06 - wouldn't be too
122:08 - difficult in many ways this is probably
122:10 - well suited to
122:11 - processing in order to keep its
122:14 - efficiency you could have the old lines
122:16 - become slowly transparent and delete
122:18 - them
122:19 - [Music]
122:20 - excellent suggestion from razif
122:24 - an essay says i want to see this with
122:26 - spring forces so much
122:27 - me too me too that'll have to be
122:30 - another one at some point um
122:32 - [Music]
122:35 - thank you all for tuning in to today's
122:37 - live stream
122:38 - um i may i think i'll probably like
122:41 - leave this running

122:46 - chat uh um for a little bit
122:49 - um i'll be back i'm gonna need some
122:51 - lunch take gloria for a walk
122:53 - i will be back with another live stream
122:55 - tomorrow if all goes according to plan
122:57 - uh in the afternoon um eastern time so
122:59 - stay tuned i will
123:00 - post notices about that in the discord
123:03 - um
123:04 - maybe on twitter but mostly if you just
123:06 - you know subscribe and hit the bell or
123:08 - whatever you'll get a notification on
123:09 - youtube
123:10 - all right thank you everybody see you

127:53 - think is important
127:54 - that i will use continuously over and
127:56 - over again
127:58 - all sorts of text generation analysis
128:00 - things
128:02 - that i will use continuously over and
128:04 - over again
128:05 - first thing i need to do is yes
128:09 - i really lose okay we're gonna do it
128:13 - kittens the kittens and kittens and
128:15 - kittens kittens and kittens and kittens

128:22 - [Music]
128:32 - bye everybody have a wonderful day see
128:34 - you tomorrow

Cleaned transcript:

do do do check check one two is this thing on uh just doing my sound check i see a few of you in the chat asking what are the topics for today um i am going to look at extending a selfavoiding walk into 3d i am going to look at the bezier function in p5.js and i will be demoing a new discord bot that is in the coding train discord and um what else what else i think that's about it i'll also be streaming tomorrow the pinned comment hopefully has this list okay let me know if my audio is working all right b we are beginning in three and a half minutes do do do do do so do so do good morning hello happy i was about to say happy friday but it's not friday it's thursday and i'm here live on the coding train broadcasting to you and i see that my mic is on and i see that my picture is visible to me so hopefully all that's working you oh gloria did i just wake you up with my loud voice uh i wish i need a dog cam i really need a puppy cam where are you going gloria oh you're going downstairs stay with me stay up here have a little rest oh okay i gotta pay attention to you welcome if this is your first time tuning into a live stream oh boy um welcome i already said welcome this is kind of what happens i'll get lost and lose track of what i'm talking about and where i am and what's going on but i hopefully get to some coding stuff that will interest you um if if this is your first time at all ever tuning into anything the coding drain then well by golly really welcome but um and what this is is this is a weekly semiweekly missing a lot of weeks here and there probably i had to guess i think i probably make 30 to 35 weeks out of the year a live stream where i cover a random smattering of topics in coding particularly around graphics and i'm using javascript and i often use various tools from the processing foundation like p5.js and processing to make creative and fun playful projects for you the people of the internet to hopefully learn something from be inspired by and go off and make your own version of it but this live stream is the unstructured sort of companion to what is otherwise on the channel a lot of sort of sequence tutorials for certain kinds of tasks and projects et cetera this is very unplanned unscripted um and kind of a mess but i'm back because it's been a really rough year i know it's been a rough year for all of you watching for everyone around the world um it's been a tricky year for me i let me just take a moment here to say congratulations to all of the teachers um education workers the students whether you're in you know second grade seventh grade in high school in college in graduate school wow i mean in all industries and types of walks of life it's been a tough year but i know this is the moment where a lot of people are graduating and i just want to say well done people it's been really hard and strange and i have done uh i would say a medium to poor job over the last year and um i i'm looking forward to having a little bit of a break finally this summer um which it's it's been quite a while um and hopefully you're gonna get one as well two fix the wrinkled green screen says cat king where is it is it like just this little tiny thing is bothering you it is kind of bothering me as well okay there we go i don't know if that was in royce is in ninth grade um i hope your end of year wraps up well um and that you uh hopefully you're what aren't you in school right now i don't know what but maybe you're in a time zone where you're not in school right now if you're watching this in school i don't know i don't know what to say to that all right i have fixed that let's see all right what do i have uh let me thank um today's sponsor uh oh i have to go oh i have to go over here and reveal some stuff um uh that's me this is my sponsor of today brilliant um if you think that learning from watching youtube or from having a geometry mug is uh for you then guess what's really for you uh brilliant you can sign up for free at brilliant.org codingtrain um it's a wonderful educational website with all sorts of interactive lessons in uh the sciences and math and computer science and programming and geometry and all the stuff that i love i think you might like it too uh so check that out i'll come back and look at the website a little more uh during in halfway through today's uh stream so um what do i have uh for you today so i'm try i aspire to have a plan and a schedule and set topics and segments and it's been i don't know how long i got to figure out like how long i've really been doing this because i can tell you that i've been making video tutorials since probably for 10 at least 10 years when did i first start uploading those videos to youtube i think around 2015. i think that's right when did i do my first live stream well that's findable it's there it's still on the channel uh when did i start calling myself coding redacted when did i start calling the channel coding train all of those things are um points in the history of this project that i would like to kind of like accumulate and track maybe you know by the way there's no wikipedia page for the cody gray i don't know if they're merits being one or there should be one but um anybody's got some spare cycles and wants to create one to sort of track some of this uh history i'm happy to help i'm not gonna uh help edit the page but happily help provide any of the information and references for that but i'm just thinking about are there any anniversaries coming up but the reason why i brought this up is like i've been doing this for quite a while and still it's just a mess and um i'm i have some changes upcoming i'm i'm hoping to redo where i live broadcast from um and have a bit more of a a larger space to work with with some different with some i want to get some kind of toys in that space um working with uh like a vinyl cutter and some other physical stuff that i want to try to make stuff live with some like led like things so that's coming um but right now i'm still i'm where i am mentally physically emotionally is just trying to get the academic year wrapped up and get organized for the summer and i'm still playing catchup so the topics that i have today are pretty much um i'm just sort of looking at the chat here so first i want to share some community contributions um i will be doing that this is the community contributions that's my community contributions theme song uh i want to do that i am very close to releasing a coding challenge video about a selfavoiding walk and one of the suggested exercises i suggest in the video is to extend it into 3d so i would like to show a version of that and i haven't had time to make it so i'll just try making that on today's live stream that's a plan uh and then oh by golly i have failed i mean i failed like get get out get out your notepad if you want to list all my failures in life you better have a lot of pages in that notepad but i and i haven't failed yet i'm um but i have failed to complete something that i have promised to make um and i uh i want to make sure that i do that in june and what it is is creating video tutorials that were requested by donors to the processing foundation annual fundraiser so i don't know if this is easily uh findable but let me go oh you don't see what i'm looking at this is the processing foundation website um if i click over onto donate um i wonder if i can find many i assume some of you watching here are in this wonderful list of names of people thank you for supporting the processing foundation i would like to look for the annual fundraiser it's very hard to google things with the word processing in it because basically all of my results are processing transactions for donorbox ah somebody will find this link for me and and and and tell me ah support p5 there we go oh that's 2019 donor box page uh what if i change this to 2020 very hard life is hard people life is full of 404 errors let me just tell you that all of my many years on this planet none outside of this planet as of yet i've been full of so many 404 errors boy i'm not prepared um but uh one of the rewards for donating to the processing foundation was to uh request a video topic from the coding train um and so um two topics that were requested from the donors one was bezier curve and one was the copy function so i want to spend a little time exploring both of those functions to prepare for what i might put in the actual and i'm thinking this is gonna be like a 10 minute video so you the viewer if you choose to stay with me here today the opportunity to help provide some suggestions or things that i might demonstrate um in the eventual tutorial so uh um um that i'm gonna make so that's that's really on my agenda am i forgetting anything i'm looking here just checking the discord oh my god i forgot the most important thing oh my goodness not the most important thing but a uh because truly they're all everything's they're all important or not important equally and unimportant actually if i really think about it but i would like to demonstrate a new discord bot that is in the coding train discord channel if you're not already in there um let me press a button which will hopefully post it into the chat um the discord channel where we have a lot of plans for the discord channel this summer to hope to do more kind of community engagement very excited about that but there is a new bot that is related to my book of random numbers which if i can find my sound effects i found that was very loud that was me who was loud i found it i had it lost for a while it was in the cabana because i had been using it for um the mouse conference video and i had left it there so it's a little uh weathered a little more weather than it usually is and we haven't done this in a while oh oh wait it's time let's look at the bot because the bot we're starting over today i'm starting i am sisyphus with the random numbers [Laughter] um so i i am sisyphus with the random numbers i am destined to just start this over but today it's this is a momentous occasion because i'm going to start over reading all oh and some lights are blinking i think someone gave a little chat message oh it was simone charlo thank you simone um i am going to start over my project which is to read this entire book i have learned so much about this book i have learned what is quite possibly the the incredibly obvious which is that when this book says a million random digits it has a million random single digits in them i have always read them in groups of five and was oft made the mistake of referring to it as one million five digit numbers which is not all the case there's two hundred thousand five digit numbers but um let's go let's get to the bot because um and then i will um uh read some random numbers uh yeah and so remember how it was saying hello to anybody who's a new viewer it takes me quite a while to get to any coding you know usually i have about 10 minutes left in my 2 hour live stream by the time i'm actually coding something so let me pull let me just do a couple things here let me switch back to here i'm going to pull up discord and oh my goodness and do this quick little fancy trick i have then i need to turn on a streamer mode privacy and safety it must be there right where is the streamer mode it doesn't automatically go on streamer mode is enabled okay so now i'm able to hopefully safe safely nicole nicole bella says omg i'm so glad you have corrected how you'll read the numbers right i mean like it's got i've got i mean i mean right thank you for validating this i feel seen right now so seen okay um all right let's see here i'm going over to here okay so this is the coding train discord lots of channels um i get um i still manage to get a lot of individual emails asking for coding help and i mean in my heart of hearts i would like to respond to every one of those but i just don't have the capacity to um and so this is where i point people to all these channels there's a volunteer team of moderators and lots of friendly faces in the discord so please come and join you can get help with all these different areas but what i am here and then for you there's also there's my favorite channel in the discord which is the pets channel uh oh ah you know what it's maybe the pets is a strong second to introductions i just i read all the introductions by the way it's my favorite channel i just love getting to know everybody who's joining and how they found the videos and that sort of thing so please introduce yourself in there i aspire to maybe i don't know if i aspire this maybe someday it'll be too many people introducing themselves and i won't be able to read them all but i really love that anyway what i am looking for is i yes this is the channel that you're going to want to try the stuff that i'm about to demonstrate to you uh bot testing but i am always very cautious on the internet in terms of what i'm showing on my live stream uh only because i've learned my lesson the hard way and i still get it wrong you know as all of you who have your notebooks full of my private api keys but um here here's my bot demo uh channel so in this bot demo channel which i'm going to there is a new discord bot thank you to saint plays uh who's the manager of the discord david i'm sure who's contributed to this and many other people i'm going to do question mark this new bot let's see here question mark is the way i know there's slash commands now on discord maybe someday we will get to that but the oh i hate how see i need this is my dream in the next live streaming studio is to have a full body camera because i have to the camera is quite close to me so i have to shrink myself and then i'm cut off here which really drives me curiously because i really want to point all the way to that help thing someday someday i'm i'm hoping i'm in an attic and i'm hoping to move to a garage long story for another time if it happens i'll let you know uh question mark i might not be taking a few weeks off if this is happening though because i'll be moving uh question mark uh help um so if i press that um that's how you trigger the choo choo bot so the choo choo bot um actually the choo choo bot which um oh oh i see yes yes yes the choo choo bot is essentially the bot uh now i remember what's happening the choo choo bot i am looking at the chat but just very you can't rely on that to answer sid hart that's question the choo choo bot is the coding train discord bot that is covered in my if i think i go under more under learning discord bot this is my series about how to code your own discord bot it's a series of six videos in theory i would like to there's many more things that i didn't get to that i would like to get to um but if you want to learn how to code your own bot check out these videos but i you know some of the features that are demonstrated are if i just type in i know this is like so tiny i should i just do this i'm i'm going to give up and do this uh choo choo if i do um let me do this uh choo choo oh no question mark choo choo i will get a random reply let's try it one more time i love how people emoji right ding right okay i'll get a random reply another feature is a gif if i just type gif uh it uses the tenor api to pull a random gif with the coding train search but if i say gif uh kitten [Laughter] by the way i'm supposed to have unlocked on my channel a beta feature and youtube or alpha feature called clips i know this has probably been something that's been on twitch for like the last 300 years where you can clip out and share separately as different moments of live streams and videos so you can get a thing of me going here we need a new coding train gif which will somebody will make but it hasn't i don't think it's available on my channel yet i got to get in touch with my youtube friends all right uh what was i saying ah that's one feature another feature what else did i do i did the message the gif i gotta look at my video tutorials i guess that was kind of it hello world posting gifs and then i like organized the code etc etc so that's kind of it but there's some new features which aren't in the tutorials but were implemented by uh the wonderful coding trained discord team and really mostly all same plays um kobe uh and if i do help now what i'm looking for is some new commands random walk find assign get number set easter egg i have no idea what that does random number reading set reading all of those things all of these are related to accessing the contents of this particular random number book and getting your very own unique random number now you will have two things you will have an index if you get one if you choose to get one of these yourself you will have an index into this book one there are one million indices can we ever get to the point where every index is taken by a viewer of the coding train probably not but maybe you will also then have a fivedigit random number that starts from that index and that random number that index that that fivedigit random number is the starting point to generate your very own unique and custom random walk visualization so to uh to really explain what i'm talking about here i need to circle back and go to coding challenges oh this is all coming full circle random walk this is coding challenge number 52 from 2017. uh you could watch this video tutorial but i will just show you the code for it this is what it does is it looks at a random number this is using the p5.js random function one zero one two or three moves up down left right um and if we let this run for one million cycles eventually we would have a particular pattern so what if instead of picking the numbers from the p5.js random function the numbers were picked from this what is the what was i thinking this was my version of the um the dark hold from the uh coding train dark hold is that what it's called whatever somebody will let me know um you will get your own visualization of the rant that what the random walk would look like if you followed all of the digits into the from from the book so without further ado let me first actually log into p5 web editor let me go back to discord i think what i can do is say question mark random walk and we'll just get one of these so this is the random walk pattern starting from position 196931 in the book and the random number there i'm not sure what uh um kobe maybe we need to work on some of the we'll do some edits here i'm not sure what instead is referring to but with the random number two eight four five one so if i do another one here is so we could just call oh it's question mark i always forget it's question mark i could always just say question mark random walk and i'll get a new pattern here's another one um so uh now ah i see oh instead we couldn't get your input that's why oh because i could do a specific one i can say random walk uh one so this will give the position one in the book this is the random walk and the number and i think actually position zero is actually the first position the random number three two five three three okay so now why am i say why why why is this happening well this is just the stuff that i love it's like the most like oddly strange like obsessive use of a book of random numbers that i could possibly think of and a good demonstration of all sorts of concepts in creative coding and randomness and bots and apis and graphics and node and p5 and all that stuff but here's if you if you like what you see so far just wait there's more i'm going to say i think it's get number ah no no no um let's let's ask for help uh find assign get number supporter user my number my saved random number is so this is my unique random number well it's not it might not be a unique random number it should tell me probably what position i'm in also realizing we've got features go we've got feature requests going on this is my random number so now if i were to uh if i were to say i think i could find it find four two six five one it can be found in the book at row nine zero zero four position seven so these are the row and position i also would like to know the index how do i i wanna set my own random number so let's try set okay ah okay so anybody can do this uh now my number should be 73091 let's see yes that's my random number i have generated you a random number so now if you happen to be just you know in theory it would be great if everybody could just like pick but there you once you have one nobody else can take it so if you are a viewer of the coding train all you have to do is just type question mark set uh and it will set a new one for you that's very similar to my previous one wow look at that it's so close um but if if you like you uh if you are a it generated me a random one a sign i don't i don't know how this bot works ah oh no this is only for me um so there's some work to be done so i'm looking at various chats here so you can get your own the idea is that you could get your own random number if you're a supporter if you signed up to join through youtube membership you're able to pick your own or in theory i've assigned you one that you when a new person joins i have a little bit where i assign them a random number but then that random number will generate a particular random walk and where if also what is next what is next in your journey uh besides having a um um besides having just your own random number and unique random walk pattern that you can generate in the discord well bear with me for a moment and i see uh the creator of the spot kobe typing in here discord manager let me go here so what is happening here well look at these beauties these are train whistles handmade i believe in vermont i found a nice little wood shop that makes them they've been shipped all the way to oregon is that how you say it i always get it wrong uh where uh coding train uh illustrator designer extraordinaire jason is working with a laser etcher and i i aspire to be able to have this set up for myself to do as well laser etching the coding train logo onto one side now what's going to go on the other side you might ask um well this so this was a uh this is not this is a speculative version of getting your own then the random walk pattern that is generated can then be rendered and etched onto the train whistle and shipped to you so at the moment i'm starting with i mean i would love everybody in the world to be able to have one of these if they so choose i'm starting with the sort of conductor level of the youtube memberships uh because it's about matching the sort of cost and time of doing this and then hopefully i'll be able to as after that after i get through that we'll see if i can start offering it to the passengers or or other folks in other ways little presents to go onto my train take a train tour around the world and hand them out but um we're still finalizing the design um but ultimately i think it uh in the end i think i'm going with offering more space on the whistle for the random walk pattern and then the index of to where the random number started as well as the number itself will then be etched there so um this is pretty much all i have to say about this the set command takes a number optionally supporters can use it as set number to pick their number right so but what if i do this am i just not uh maybe i'm not actually a supporter so it's not letting me do it because it's giving me a different random number but to me i think we need to also always offer the number and the index and because the index is really what is driving the unique pattern that the random walk is generating is there anything more for me to say about this play around with this uh post your questions but um it's 10 35 here i am going to look now at the feature of reading and set reading i looked back in time for you shiffman last read the book at page eight oh wait a second welcome mark boots you are the very first passenger to board the code i mean you're all passengers but the you know green highlighted bar in the chat that says passenger welcome to passengers you are the very first one to join with the new system of the bot random numbers and while i could open up my book and find a random number for you let's try out a new um a new uh feature which is random number so now sound effects are all on the wrong page we will now get mark boots random number [Laughter] did i spell it wrong [Laughter] uh okay uh oh turns out it's called random okay try it again here we go what is this emoji that someone keeps reacting with i fortunately i can't see it but i have a feeling it's something i don't want to see all right so this is now mark boots now now mark boots if you're not currently in the discord uh i can't actually set and assign this for you right now but please join the discord uh and uh be in touch come into the supportive channels we'll get it all figured out okay so back to back to um reading last read from the book at page 18 row six and column one um the emojis are really distracting i totally agree uh um what am i set uh i need help again because i can't i have no my memory does not uh uh set reading okay set reading zero let's see if this works we're starting over people we're starting over please provide a valid page row and column okay i want well i want to be on page the first page of all the random digits is page one the row is zero and the column is zero okay so let's see if this works set reading page one row column aha you have updated the book position to one that should say page one another little live bug report uh row zero and column zero and now we begin for the fourth or fifth time the ceremonial coding train reading of the random numbers i'm just gonna do one row just to ease my way into this one row one zero zero nine seven three two five three three seven six five two zero one three five eight six three four six seven three five four eight seven six eight zero nine five nine zero nine one one seven three nine two nine two seven four nine four five all right i am verklempt now set reading page one row one column zero all right we're good so next time when i am streaming i can just say reading and it will tell me i last read the book at page one row one and column zero so um it's interesting you wanna think about the language here i mean this is a little bit of just semantics here but um this is technically speaking the starting position for the next random number to read so the last read was the end of page one row one column you know whatever and are the columns right there 50 are there 50 columns or are there 10 because we still sometimes think of them in groups of five which might seem arbitrary to you but just to be clear it's not completely arbitrary because this book if i hold it up to the camera and if it would focus on it the numbers are organized in groups of five so that that does have actual meaning the question is would i ever stop reading mid group of five i think i could live with the constraint of not but technically speaking what are the columns oh so much to think about how are we gonna get this right all right um i can't believe this live stream has been 40 minutes uh of of me talking about the random number book i do by the way have a mug with geometry formulas on him is it lovely it's getting quite warm up here where i am you know what it's time for it that's right it's time for community contributions that's right it's the time where i the person live streaming looks at my computer and pulls up things that you the viewers in the coding training have made in response to various videos and examples and things and features them on the stream and mostly just has a big smile and cheers and loves that stuff but what's that breaking news a community contribution came in across my twitter desk just this morning and i'm going to try to find it right now um here it is um let me see if i can zoom into this here for a second this is from and i have permission to share this this is from dhruv jamulia who one hour ago wrote just made an a.i that learns to play tetris using genetic algorithms and p5.js so in a moment i'm going to click on the web application you can see the github there and then there it is thank you i mentioned a huge shout out to shiffman yeah yeah uh just a medium sized a small shout out perfectly fine no need for any huge shout outs whose videos on genetic algorithms inspired me to make this when i clicked on the link my jaw dropped to the floor and i thought wow this is really if i just didn't waste hours without talking about random numbers in my live streams maybe i would have actually built this project because this is on my list um and so dhruv i don't know how you feel about this since you've already made it but on my i would like to uh do a bunch of videos about both coding uh tetris and as well as building an ai with genetic algorithms and neural networks to play it but let's take a look at it i'm going to click over to the webpage and close out the tweet and come back here okay so tetris ai artificial intelligence learning to play the world's most influential puzzle game i'm going to go to the classic we can look at i encourage you to look at the about this is the link if anyone's looking for it tetris ai.netwifi.app um and let's do classic okay now uh so i believe you know i didn't make this to be clear this is a community contribution and you know that because of the music i'm playing uh let's hit start so what it looks like to me and i'm totally speculating here is that it is just randomly playing this tetris game so randomly moving things left and right randomly rotating them and uh it's tried twice this is very similar to the flappy bird um examples that i've made it's tried it twice four times and each time it's keeping track of what score it got now i'm guessing that whatever mechanism is making the choices uh whatever system of rules you know i can only assume if i were doing this i would probably use my uh neural evolution technique so there's like a neural network that's taking the configuration of the tetris board as its input and then the output is some action like left right left right drop rotate left right i'm not sure whatever the options in tetris are and then whichever ones score the highest after a certain number of times or recombine to make new ones and i'm going to hit increase speed which is one of my uh and we can see it doing a lot more and so i can only assume that after some amount of time i don't know how long we would have to wait um we would get one that plays fairly well so one thing that i think is good to do if i can if you'll humor me uh with a little um feedback here is uh if after this has been run for a while to be able to save the state you could use even local storage for that or perhaps just save the current like configuration of the high scorer might be an excellent thing that you could load back and that's something that i think that i did with my um flappy bird um examples um and kake in the chat is saying hey i made this project a while ago using deep q learning so deep cue learning is one of my uh i don't know is it white whales is it my windmill that i'm always trying to defeat i don't know what cultural historical uh reference point i should be using here um but i really i i don't it's deep cue learning and q learning is a topic that i have really been hoping to explore and cover and hopefully someday i can get to it and chris writes this feels like the 2021 version of war games great movie by the way i watched ferris bueller with my family recently that was a lot of fun uh okay so let's see um i'm almost halfway through my time and i want to get to some of the coding projects i'm planning to do i also need to take a break and tell you about the brilliant the sponsor of today's live stream um but let's look at let's let me um let me let me constrain myself to looking at two community contributions and the way that i'm going to do that i know we have the wonderful wheel spinner but i'm going to just try seeing today and thank you so much for sharing this on twitter with me i would like to um can close this i'm going to go to the coding train website i'm going to go to the coding challenges and there are currently uh 161 of them so let's go back to discord and uh say random can i give it a range i can't remember if i can give it a range i got a number uh one three seven two one so if i were to just do it uh modulus 161 will google do that for me uh 44 oh modulo badger low modulo modulo is the operator modulus is the result of the operation 44. so now we're going to go to coding challenge number 44 it's an oldie um and oh it's a multipart one oh a fin 111 this one's going to be a little wonky i'm actually going to be really surprised if this one has any community contributions uh let's take a look at uh part two and ah there are there are three community contributions well two are by the same person that's no that's uh it still counts as three um and one is called feeling emoji and all ooh i love that title feeling emojian emojianal um mckay is also asking do you think we'll explore ray tracing i would like to i would like to um so let's take a look at a sentiment.js this is i don't know what this is hello okay um i am dan oh okay the coding train is live and happy ah okay so this looks like uh so if i remember correctly what this particular coding challenge demonstrates is a methodology for doing sentiment analysis on a text which uses a pre sort of hardcoded list of words with assigned sentiment scores that were put together if my memory serves me correctly by a group of psychologists um who created this list it's a wellknown list called the afin 111 and so i presumably what this is is a nice little interface for typing in a sentence and the reason why i might get a score of zero is none of these words the coding train or in the list but if i say happy jovial um sunny day and i got a score of 2.5 maybe it's like an average of the scores of all those words um sad depressed gray day negative 1.67 so you can see you know this is not a a very sophisticated method but it is a mechanism for taking any arbitrary sequence of words and turning it into a numeric score so you can go back and watch that coding challenge thank you for this new interface sam lee and now here's a colorized sentiment score also by sam lee um which ah whoa um i don't know what to do paste text here um happy sunny jovial day do i press this button now and i get the score and oh and look at that it is highlighting the words with probably a sort of brightness level according to what score it got so like for example um let's just go to rainbow on wikipedia and let's copy paste like this text bring it in here press this button wow not a single word is in the aphin 111 dataset that's kind of nuts um interestingly enough it would be it would be interesting to compare this to um uh where's oh sorry learn.mo5js.org to what is in the um the sentiment analysis model in the ml5.js library so this is a particular module in the ml5 library that uses a neural network to take text as an input and output a sentiment score and this particular pretrained model that's offered with ml5 was trained off of movie reviews so i think we could have a very long thorough discussion as to you know what uh what sort of biases and sort of are inherent in using movie reviews as your training set but you need some training data set that has chunks of text with labeled with a sentiment score and so presumably a movie review that's been assigned a score like our star rating that's how you can collect a data set like that without having to manually curate one so i think if i um go here to let's try going to this uh example i hope this works um and let me just change this here so this example uses the movie review model and it scores the sentiment of a text with a value between 0 and 1 0 being negative 1 being positive movie reviews were truncated to a maximum of 200 words and only the most 20 000 most common words in the room so this is very similar but instead of being a sort of hardcoded curated list of words that a sort of socalled trained expert i don't mean that they aren't experts i just think it's like you know who are those people and are why are we entrusting them to assign sentiment scores to language i think that's a complex question uh what's the difference between doing that trust having an expert created list of words versus an automated list of words essentially generated from a neural network based system so let's go um well let's just sort of see you can see we get today is the happiest day and it's full of rainbows is a very high number saddest day and is full of uh rain storms and clouds uh sad and miserable does that not work cause i got got a very high sentiment score yeah um well i got a different score and let's see if we can make it be negative this is weird something's up something is definitely a miss here um miserable sad annoyed i hate everything and i'm so gosh darned tired angst analysis demo there we go what's it i just curious yeah all right so i'm not sure um yeah i'm not sure what happened there before but we can see that you know with me trying to write very extreme uh sort of sentences that uh in my mind are clearly uh negative versus positive um i'm able to sort of produce some results um this is a very small text box but i'm just curious to see if i can paste this in here and hit submit the rainbow wikipedia page is full of happy positive uh energy and sentiment all right uh we've got one more uh here to uh demonstrate feeling emojinol by chris hall let's take a look at this um and how are you i am okay today it's been a hard year but things are looking up and i'm excited for this summer so this is pretty cool i mean i i like what this is doing um it's looking at my text it's showing me which words have which sentiment score so we can see i'm getting a total of two hard we had a negative score excited had a high positive score and then i guess it's summarizing it uh in with an emoji as well as with kind of some uh text i don't know of how that text is generated picked from a list i don't know if it can only ever be a happy or sad emoji um but i like this idea of almost like a free writing exercise and in real time as you're free writing um you're getting this um feedback on the the web page itself is changing i could imagine doing something that's more abs that's kind of abstract in this vein as you're typing an email even like this would be like a chrome extension you're typing an email in the sort of color scheme of your email editor uh is a browser extension i should say uh is um is changing or could you have something that's like reading the sentiment of your code like code comments that would be kind of interesting um so um so this is great thank you guys see this is this is uh this is bringing me so much happiness today because uh i just love to see the sort of creative possibilities that come out of of many of these examples ah all right hold on a in the chat says i just discovered this channel i am excited but where do i get started well lucky for you i caught your message in the chat and i am here to answer it so um back to the coding train website if coding is brand new to you and you want to explore it through this channel you know to be clear there are many other pathways and possibilities and places for you to explore coding um but um through this channel this particular beginners sorry these playlists are meant for beginners with no experience whatsoever um the p5.js one is probably the most uptodate one and in fact you can sort of see i'm slowly filling in the gaps of replacing older videos so this is a beginner playlist that i would like to always have available and kind of current and you can see that there are some videos that were made in 2015 that are still in this playlist the code for all these videos still works i also look a little bit younger i think my brain is working better as i age you know this different things seem harder for me to figure out but uh so you know i think there's hopefully there's still value in these older videos but um you know i've been able to improve the examples for clarity based on feedback as well as improve some of the production value of the videos so you can see that these are recent ones that are newer that just um you know from uh from february march of this year so next on my list you know it's always this balance of how much do i want to do live streaming versus uh work on the nature of code book or versus work on updating these videos so but i would like by the fall to finish replacing all the way up until i think these um boy a lot any of that were made in 2015 so i think the 2017 ones i'll probably keep still but all the 2015 ones i would like to replace by the way if you have feedback i don't know what people think of the new sort of thumbnails um and the new style of the videos but um but yeah so that's where um um that's where you can begin i'm seeing people in the chat requesting to show different contributions and but um i think right now um as it is 11 a.m the exact is perfect i spent an hour this is this is how it should be i spent an hour you know it should really be 50 minutes or 55 minutes because i'm gonna take a five minute break i yeah the processing ones are really old um yeah i spent about an hour kind of meandering through showing some contributions talking about the discord bot um i want to work on in the second half of the live stream i want to work on um self 3d selfavoiding walk and and looking at uh bezier curves um so i'm going to take a short break before i take a break i would like to thank uh today's sponsor uh the coding train the engine is kept running by the sponsors of the go to drain built this thing up that has a lot of components and a lot of pieces and i'm really thankful to have uh partners oh and ahmer super chat is coming in this also helps keep the engine running uh uh have friends from the different sponsors who are able to support the work that i'm doing um if you like learning stuff on the coding train if you also like having mugs i just switch over here to this view with uh geometry formulas on them this is one side of my mug you know you know what's better than learning some geometry formulas from your mug of tea or coffee or warm water with lemon as my grandmother used to like to make um i think it was called uh yiddish it's like vasa mcmillan anybody who knows yiddish what does that mean is that like with milk in it i'm not sure it's like these things are popping into my mind um but brilliant is really um a website and uh app that i think you will um particularly particularly love it has um so what do i do i talk ramble incessantly um and demonstrate stuff but really for me the way that i learn most effectively is through trying things on my own and so brilliant is really a website that's all about uh and an app all about trying things on uh for your own interactive courses daily challenges um and just the the topics like if i go to the courses page um you know this is like i just go ah well i just want to gobble it all up because it's all of the topics that i really love it's got stuff for all ages um you know two courses that i would like to highlight for you one is the um fundam program with python course so i i like to highlight this one because i um program with javascript and a lot of get a lot of requests about learning python and this would be a great one to explore the basics of programming with a different language for you this course called geometry fundamentals has some really amazing uh visual animations um that demonstrate core concepts in in math and geometry honestly one of the reasons why i love it so much is my mic still working it's like disappeared from my screen it is um one of the reasons why i love this course so much is that um it gives me a lot of ideas of like visual things that i want to make um coming back to uh here um like this beautiful geometry course um i'm uh it's just like really amazing i'm gonna hit continue um and you can see here i'm in lesson two uh i got this one right i guess at some point i'm gonna go on next well i'm a little bit afraid so the end the answer to the prior problem we found that a progressive series of similar l shapes each with a red portion of one third and use that to derive the fact that the entire large square has a red portion of one third it's kind of like these infinite series are super interesting another approach is take each red square and make two copies one to the right of the square being copied and one to the one below so this shows that in purple oh interesting and this method of covering the overall large square leads to two purple squares for every one red square this again moment of realization this leads to the red area being one third of the overall square um so you can go through and uh it's going to give me oh no no i gotta work on this one now okay uh so like at your your instinct would be like threefourths right because one two three and then the blue circle you know there's four sections but this blue circle has a yellow one let's think about this are we at four so it's more than three threefourths right so we can eliminate threefifths which is less than threefourths i kind of want to do that purple thing how did that purple thing go where for every red square we put two blue squares so for every but there's no for every oh each one of these is four so for every four 8 12 yellow squares i can color three blue squares so 12 out of 15 which is fourfifths did i get that right i got it right oh my god oh that was so exciting oh wait wait wait i don't want to go back go back um what i love about this is then i go to the show explanation and um yeah it did this is what i did in my head uh 12 and then three um awesome which reduces to four fifths oh this is so fun so um if you are interested in this stuff um you can sign up for free at brilliant.org codingtrain um it lets them know that you found it through the coding train which helps me out a little bit and there's lots of stuff for you to explore there there is also a premium subscription that you can buy for yourself a gift to somebody else and if you go through that link the first 200 people to do so will get 20 off okay um i am going to now um so thank you again to brilliant um i am going to take a short uh hopefully just like two or three minute break just to grab some water uh do a 30 second meditation and come back to look at something called a selfavoiding walk and extending that into 3d and hopefully by next week the actual it's about a 35 to 40 minute coding challenge video building the entire selfavoiding walk okay uh see you all in about two or three minutes and i'm muting my microphone here i'll be right back so do so do all right i am back um i see folks in the uh chat are asking a very common frequently asked question which is what is the music that i'm playing uh this is a song it's called tori the dog i have no idea why it's called that is by a composer named adam blau who is a film and tv uh composer based in los angeles i think you can find um him on twitter um adam blau i think he has a website adam blough.com adam blau is a friend of mine from my old bright college years okay thank uh offered up this uh track that he had written that doesn't get used anywhere else for me to use um all right so what's happening now we're actually going to do some coding uh thanks again to the sponsor of today brilliant um so what are you looking at here this is remember i spent all this time talking about random walks and the uh new coding train discord bot earlier and the next coding challenge that will be released on the channel is programming exactly this and i know this is a little bit unfortunate the way things are working for me these days where i'm covering additional things from the uh coding challenge on a live stream when the coding challenge hasn't yet been released but that's the way it works right now um so this is the code that the challenge ends now what what you can see about what's different about a selfavoiding walk is it's making a random decision every frame to move up down left or right but it's never allowed to step into a position where it has been before so we you might be able to see this a bit more uh clearly as if i started over and you can see one of the things that i've built into this example is if it ends up somewhere where it is stuck and has nowhere to go it will backtrack and try a different route so this is i i think this is a beautiful um um a beautiful an algorithm that has beautiful results um i i kind of hypnotized by it i could kind of watch it all day i think there's a lot of probably this is just a very literal basic visualization of it i think there's a lot of possibilities of what you could do to explore this um on a live stream a while ago i think i did this with you know some curves and started to make these different patterns from it but what i uh would like to demonstrate in the video is what it looks like if it's in 3d so you know time box myself here maybe just give me myself 20 25 minutes to see um uh how that works now i just realized that i need a three okay so first of all let me duplicate i already duplicated this uh so let's say three you know what i wanna first see like how do i even render this in 3d so first of all if i say webgl great okay so that's excellent now can i in draw say orbit is it do i say orbit controls orbit control there's a uh oh there we go so there's a function in p5 look at that that is wild that is so cool so even just doing this and i think i oh and you know my font is so tiny sorry about that um let's now let's give myself a little bit more space and i can zoom in ah hold on i don't know why this orbit controls thing there we go it's just very do i not yeah it works it's just kind of like a little wonky um all right so now now that that works uh and maybe what i would like to do is have the spacing be a little bit bigger so that way also it's a little bigger okay um so i can sort of see this whoa it moving closer all right so now what i would like to do is change this to make 3d array columns rows what's the word for the in a 3d grid i mean columns rows i mean it's really just x the three different axes uh i i was to say like zoll's i wanted to make a um zowls okay columns rows and i'm officially calling them zowls [Laughter] uh layers depths depth i realize it's depth but okay i'm fine uh not we'll call it depth so for every column we have a certain number of rows and for every then four and this should for every element of for every row i mean this is like a crazy way to make a threedimensional array in javascript but it's just the way i know how uh is this right i think this is right um we can do a nice console log table so we're gonna make a 3d array columns rows depth and i'm just going to say depth is the same as the number of columns and let's let's test this out orbit control let's test this out so i'm just opening up the console here because if i say make 3d array 10 10 10. was it not called that oh i have to run it oh unexpected token but we have an extra parenthesis there okay it's running let's go back to here okay that works so um three let's make it three by three by three let's just test it let's look at that so it's got an array of three arrays and each array of three arrays has three things in it empty times three that makes sense can i do like console.table um test yeah so this makes sense because it is a 2d array with each spot having an array in it okay so that's good i think the only thing okay so now what else do i need to change and can i give myself a little bit more room here i guess i shouldn't have made it uh 800 by 800. let's do that and then do you know as i obsessively try to have the right amount of space here okay so now um we've got a 3d array the spot is zero zero zero um return is valid i j k everything's got to have a third element to it uh oh k k plus plus k is less than depth i j k spot i j k i'm just kind of let me hit stop here and turn auto refresh off please i just want everything that was previously in two dimensions to switch to being three all right what else do i got here is valid all right and then also check if k is less than zero k is greater than or equal to depth that would be off the grid okay translate i don't really need to worry about that spot is next spot path path length college uh if you've hit every spot uh spot.z spot.z okay now where's my spot class needs to have a dz and then all of the steps now there's a lot more possibilities for all of the possible steps that it could take wow if i did a good job writing this code the original code extending it into 3d is going to be as easy as what i'm doing right now which i don't know if that's really the case but we're about to find out okay uh i j k uh the z is and i realized this would make a lot more sense if you had all just watched the video where i built this all options all options new x new z is valid new x new y new z um okay grid uh we need the z component which is k plus dz is that really everything what's the chance that i did this right very little oh my goodness i think it's actually kind of doing it it seems to not be moving along the z very much though i mean it did like why why did it go why is it sticking within a sort of current plane the second dx should be negative one in the step constructor i think i got it right hold on it's kind of staying within one plane line 13. oh thank you that i couldn't see there we go wild wow that is wild what why did i just do that in like 10 minutes i mean visually this could be vastly improved i'm trying to think if there's anything i could do right now just to sort of visually improve it so one thing is i feel like the line thickness is a very thick so um let's let's make it thinner and maybe what i want to do is actually not use orbit control but translate i'm putting where it starts in the center but it can't go negatively so what if i actually have it start at um like what's the center center x equals uh columns divided by it's the same for all of them so columns divided by uh 2 but make sure i floor it and then uh let's just reuse that so i'm gonna have it start in the center um and let's just make sure that works what did i just do um but now i want to translate oh whoa that's weird but now i don't want to translate it anywhere or no i want to translate it by negative i want to translate it you know what let me put orbit controls back in wait i i want it to starting in the center of the grid which i want oh no spacing times columns negative spacing times rows negative spacing times depth there we go this is what i want i want it to start in the center but be able to go in all directions do i have orbit control in so now there we go i wanted to be able to kind of move around it can you fade it darker the further away from the camera yeah are we breaking yes is this what was that called like the tubes that old uh win3 this old screensaver am i am i just remaking that what was it was it like is this what it was called pipes pipes i did not realize i just made this all right let's what's the so yeah i'm totally basically making this amazing amazing all right but uh i have to visually think about the design of this a bit more but i wanted to do a couple things one is what if i take out orbit controls and just do like rotate x frame count times 0.01 or something so it's always going to whoa that's a little bit weird and let's try rotating y more slowly okay okay so this i'm enjoying and what can i do is there anything i can do just sort of visually right now yeah i kind of wanted to make it thinner there we go so here we go this is what i will capture give each walker a i want to start multiple ones give them different colors so this is what um oh um this is what i would like i just this is enough for me right now i just wanted to be able to demonstrate um to demonstrate the core idea and so i have now a visual thing i can render for um making it in through in 3d yeah yep i could write i could take the rgb so first of all let me grab this code and i want to go to discord and ah random max between zero thank you and i'm going to go to links so i this is where i will typically paste links to things that i'm doing in the live stream somebody is welcome to paste this into the youtube chat i just don't have that open right now but um so that's where you can find the link to this code right now um but i think this is good enough like this this is what i want to capture that video this is the last piece for this video to come out any questions translate to center before rotating so it stays in perspective so in theory it's it is translated to the center of this particular kind of cube that it is going to try to fill um based on this translation but i believe that it is appears that it's not staying in our perspective because it randomly chose to go in one direction at the beginning and never came back to go the other way so i could dynamically translate to like do something interesting of like where it currently is like this would be a little bit crazy like what if i said um translate to um negative spot dot x negative spot dot y negative spot dot z like i think this would make it i mean it's it's very jarring but it's following the current spot whoa i could okay wait i got i got it now i can't uh let lerp x lerp y lerp z um how do i have them all equal zero is there a way to declare three variables all at once where they all equal zero that's not just this uh okay um so what i want to do is say lerpx equals lerp lerp lerp x spot dot x ooh stallion that's way too jarring for me um so if i want to move towards the spot i want to go just like a small percentage of the way there so let's say 0.1 let's call that amount and let's do that for y z and then negative lerp x lerp y lerp z this should now more smoothly follow it oops negative and one more negative let's see if this works right you can see that it's a bit more smooth let's make the amount like really literally less there we go it's kind of cool so it's like an automated sort of camera that's trying to why is it moving further away though it should be staying close to it maybe that's just the lurping is slow it's kind of interesting though i mean i don't know if i like what happens if i take the rotate out very strange so there's probably there's there's probably a uh a different way to do this that would be uh interesting in terms of following the camera but this is kind of a quick demonstration that i have right now i kind of love it actually but i want to look at bezier curves the rotation is around the wrong anchor point i know right well i'm not rotating now um but now i am what if i do rotate z so it's just kind of spinning move the rotate above the translator all right all right yeah focus on the center work out the center from the minimum x to the minimum y yeah there's so many ways that this could be done but focusing on the center would be a very good idea uh capture the maximum x y and z and center on their midpoints i'm going to leave that as an exercise to the viewer although i kind of to be honest that actually okay can i allow myself five more minutes to do that let's use p5 vector um so i need min x min xyz max xyz so for let v of path and then i would say min x y z equals um or spot of path like oh no let but yeah i'll just say v it's fine min x y z equals the minimum whichever one is smaller of v dot x and itself minx y z dot x min x y z dot y min x y z dot z so this is getting the minimum xyz then the maximum should be the max function whichever one is bigger between the x the y the z and the max then center dot x equals min x y z i kind of want to just call these min v no but it's not really that because min x y z of max x y z dot x minus min x y z dot x times zero half of that plus the minimum is that right center dot x is the maximum minus the minimum that's the the range half of the range offset from the minimum y z y z y z y z oh wait a sec the maximum the minimum can't be zero it'll always be zero so the minimum has to start at like infinity um and it's the minimum oh dot x dot y dot z dot x dot y dot z and now what happens if let's get rid of the rotation what if i do translate negative center x negative center y negative center z and i might want to lerp those but hold on missing parentheses oops here yeah look at that that is wild okay let's put the alert back in this is this is really cool uh let's put the alert back in uh where is that lerp lerp lerp so this should be center dot x no no center dot x center dot y center dot z and let's yeah that's fine and then uh lerp x lerp y lerp z okay here we go everybody so it's interesting i i was i would have might be done the average location but i like this minimum and maximum because it's sort of like panning now the question is should i add some rotation like is that interesting to also see it rotate i feel like i would like to see it rotate around the y axis is kind of what i'm expecting to see it's why is it rotate away the rotation am i just wrong about the way that i'm thinking about this and the rotation really should be before the translation maybe yeah this is what i meant to do i don't understand why the rotation should be before that's like backwards the way i think about it but this is great if i don't say so myself uh um let me see here what else is happening um all right now can is this the pipes screensaver apparently it is it was not my intention i probably should brand this like redo the coding challenge as windows pipes screensaver and that would be good clickbait let me just see now if i can do something kind of nice which is make this window width window height file share and get this we hit stop i'll share and get this view view enter full screen and here we are everybody let's just enjoy this for a little bit this is a selfavoiding walk in three dimensions people really want me to add color [Laughter] but i want to look at bezier curves today i only have 20 minutes left oh the live poll i forgot about the live poll all right i have no idea if the live poll is gonna work but there's been so many um uh music please i don't know i don't really got any uh okay i'm still here by the way all right let's add color bessie by the way uh for all of you um we're wondering when is the next live stream it's tomorrow so i can do the bezier curve stuff i want to do tomorrow um let's add some color okay so what's going to be the best way to do this all right let's try um where am i i don't think though um i have to change the way that i'm drawing it because um unfortunately i'm drawing it as one continuous line and um raycasting coding challenge of the infamous maze from windows 98 would be a nice next step that's a great suggestion cola games a random walk with bezier curves oh that is such a good idea tomorrow so i'm live streaming tomorrow around 2 p.m eastern um you know i'm kind of cramming in oh i've committed to doing a bunch of live streams this month but i didn't get to them so i'm cramming them in at the end so i'm doing another one tomorrow but let's see i think what i would need to do is draw them as individual lines so let me just try something first real quick which is v1 is path index i v two is path index i plus one and then if i'm drawing a line from v one dot x v one dot y v one dot z uh dot y d2 dot z is this the same result yeah okay great so now i can do individual colors because i can take um i have a crazy idea here i should probably do hue maybe i should just do it as um just using hsb mode well the way i was going to do it since we have x y z is r is map v one v1.x which goes between 0 and the number of columns to between 0 and 255. let's just try this real quick g b uh and so i think someone said layers could be instead of depth it could be a good idea uh stroke rgb let's just try this there's some colors appearing here what did i miss v1 xyz zero column what am i missing here oh i could do map the path dot length distance from the center interesting uh yes okay wait why are the most of them just oh it's x x there we go this is what i need to do there we go so this is uh a different way of doing it let's take a look at how this looks and i wonder if actually i should have a minimum amount of color for each just to sort of enforce some amount of brightness and now let's hit save let's go to here see the full screen version cola game says i forgot to add that i could never thank you enough for getting me interested in programming literally shaped the course of my life oh that's so nice thank you uh your passion for what you do is amazing yeah all of the coordinates are positive so this was kind of a nice um idea of a way of doing it and um but i do think that cycling the hue along the path is maybe a nicer way of doing it so this is a different way of doing it would be so that's one way let's say let me comment this out too let me say a color mode hsb so now what if i say uh stroke i modulus 360 that's the hue and then just have these max out at 100. oh i still need these two points yeah i think this is what people were looking for uh so let's see this what happened here there we go so this i think is what folks were looking for this definitely works better in terms of being ridiculously colorful selfavoiding walk but i i i can do i could do you one better here let's add the frame count so now it is also psych the frame count gets added before i take the modulus and now is the cycling too fast do you even notice it does anybody care i like this i mean i could make it i always thought i could make it like more extreme very blinky let's just do it by two i don't know maybe the softness slowness of it is fine um all right ready here we go we are finishing today's live stream with this selfavoiding walk is it possible to make the lines thicker yeah i was making them thinner on purpose but yeah i can try that did i just close the other the code no it's just in another tab let's we can make the we can go back to what i had before i think that took are they thicker oh no that's for the point where's the stroke weight there it is the problem is um you can see there's a flaw at the end well this is a nice place to wrap up today's live stream with my 3d selfavoiding walk rainbow rainbow colored selfavoiding god this is bringing me enormous joy i don't need to be in the image here i don't know if that music really went with let's see what a little music do i have i forgot that does really work this kind of works so the drawing nicole says if the drawing point was also a specular light could look pretty cool that would be kind of amazing all right um i'm i'm wrapping this up i'm i'm a little disappointed in myself now because um the the coding challenge definitely like if this were the end result of the coding challenge i mean i could record another like five minutes of extending it into 3d um but um i think i should just let it let it be um but like i love the idea of branding this coding challenge as the windows pipes screensaver yeah it would definitely that would definitely help its uh youtube popularity i'll have to think about that i have to think about whether i have that uh yeah it's so uh um alex is in the chat is pointing it's slowing down a bit so you know this uh this is a limitation of you know javascript canvas and the number of vertices that i'm drawing for all of these lines um we don't know if there would be i'm sure there are some efficiencies that could be added here or geometry that could be saved and in a way that it gets rendered more in an optimized way because it's not those points aren't moving although my five minutes left in my allocated amount of time trying to be good about just streaming for two hours the poll is forgotten yeah i'll have to come back for the poll tomorrow i just went ahead and um but one idea that i kind of have just out of curiosity oh no no that won't yeah actually it will um what if i did something crazy and just like jiggled all the points oh yeah that is [Laughter] i mean i i don't know what i expected to happen there but that's really kind of nuts yeah i should be using something more like thoughtful in terms of uh uh and like maybe what's interesting is i'm storing all the xy positions of all these points separately from where they are in the array so there's not really any reason why it couldn't over time kind of disintegrate and get a little bit more like look at it's kind of getting wonky as we go um it probably would make more sense for me to use a particular algorithm that retained a displacement from its original but i like the idea of it being less kind of exact and actually maybe that's maybe instead of moving it randomly i should just offset them a little bit like so in other words like what if actually instead of doing that in the actual spot class when i make the x position like what if i just say plus offset based on the spacing so it will be in a regular grid visually still the data still retains its that's too much i suppose i cannot stop i need a time limit which i am now down to three minutes left still too much yeah this is kind of more what i'm looking for maybe not enough yeah so this is interesting so let me just let's let's go look at this in the full screen one so this is just adding a little bit of noise so that it kind of looks perhaps a little bit more sketched um you know i think that's sort of an interesting uh twist on this um it still is very blocky you know i could certainly try to make it more like curved lines but i kind of like this um adding a little uh mess to it all right i'm gonna see uh so so by the way um please join the discord and try out all of the discord bot stuff um message um message us and give us feedback about how to improve that um it's not windows xp now anymore um i will be um back tomorrow if you can believe that uh my goal i haven't i didn't i didn't set the time yet but it's um i have stuff in the morning so probably around 2 p.m eastern also for about two hours and yes cat king writes uh in the chat um breaking news coding train releases a copyright disco sensation that's gripping our nation um but yeah let's look at seeing if we can add bezier curves to this tomorrow and see what we get um thank you everyone for joining today um i have this little uh goodbye song that's about three minutes long so i'm gonna set this to full screen and refresh the page and ethan asks and answers some questions why don't you update your macbook to big sir i'm afraid too should i do that couldn't hurt uh did you try the new slash commands i have not tried the new slash commands yet but i do intend to do so at some point soon um cat king says bye bye to you as well uh just a quick uh shout out thank you to today's sponsor brilliant.org codingtrain you can sign up for free there i don't know is there a course or puzzle that has that is related to the this uh 3d selfavoiding walk i'd love to know mutate the xyz while drawing every frame so over time it would disintegrate with the cumulative effect yes that's what i started with but it became too disintegrated what would be really cool is to add spring forces between them so they could kind of like uh like add a spring force between like where it's supposed to be and it's offset so they could kind of jiggle but always spring back into place that might be interesting um after today's news i'm quite glad that i didn't buy an m1 says julian i don't know what today's news is i don't have to fill me in on that um we will need a processing conversion if we're adding curves to this yeah so i definitely would like to make a processing version of this that wouldn't be too difficult in many ways this is probably well suited to processing in order to keep its efficiency you could have the old lines become slowly transparent and delete them excellent suggestion from razif an essay says i want to see this with spring forces so much me too me too that'll have to be another one at some point um thank you all for tuning in to today's live stream um i may i think i'll probably like leave this running um as i go um and i'll keep an eye on the chat uh um for a little bit um i'll be back i'm gonna need some lunch take gloria for a walk i will be back with another live stream tomorrow if all goes according to plan uh in the afternoon um eastern time so stay tuned i will post notices about that in the discord um maybe on twitter but mostly if you just you know subscribe and hit the bell or whatever you'll get a notification on youtube all right thank you everybody see you tomorrow i hope more regular live streams right as always i always forget that this stop this stop it stop this stop i'm gonna do this stop this stop i'm gonna do this this stop this stop this stop i'm gonna do this stop never forget this never forget this dot i'm gonna say once again here we go sing it with me it's the forward coordinate song it's the fuller cartesian coordination autotune and the internet will fix that for me see it with me it's the polaroid unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what i get i'm really losing my mind okay let's do it the kittens the kittens the kittens kittens and kittens i feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this is a this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it i'm really getting to something i need my sound and effects what else is there unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes that was invalid syntax i forgot uh there was one other thing here that i think is important that i will use continuously over and over again all sorts of text generation analysis things that i will use continuously over and over again first thing i need to do is yes i really lose okay we're gonna do it kittens the kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and getting kittens the kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and getting bye everybody have a wonderful day see you tomorrow
