03:32 - check hello everyone i will be starting
03:35 - in approximately
03:36 - two minutes and 30 seconds let me turn
03:40 - down the music
03:41 - for when i'm talking that's probably a
03:43 - slightly better balance and i'll be back

06:29 - hello happy friday and welcome to
06:32 - a live episode of what's the name of
06:36 - this thing again
06:37 - the coding train is it okay if i change
06:41 - the name of the channel at some point in
06:42 - the future i probably won't
06:44 - but i'm just wondering oh remember what
06:47 - i used to call it
06:48 - coding something that i won't say right
06:52 - now i suppose
06:54 - um hello everyone it's so nice to see
06:56 - all of you um
06:57 - saying hello in the chat um hello to
07:00 - everyone
07:01 - around the world who i know watches the
07:04 - coding train i know there are quite a
07:05 - few viewers in india
07:07 - and i hope everyone there is staying
07:09 - safe and healthy
07:11 - um i'm really thinking of everybody
07:13 - around the world who is struggling
07:15 - through so many different kinds of
07:16 - challenges right now whether it be the
07:17 - global pandemic
07:19 - or um otherwise so i hope that this
07:21 - stream
07:22 - uh wherever you are whatever time it is
07:24 - that you're watching can bring you
07:25 - something
07:26 - positive today whether it's uh watching
07:29 - me just struggle through
07:31 - two hours of trying to use a computer or
07:34 - maybe you might learn something
07:35 - or find a little humor or laughter or a
07:38 - friendly face
07:39 - that's what i hope my face is as i try
07:41 - to clean my glasses
07:42 - um but let's get started uh first up
07:46 - i would like to thank today's sponsor of
07:49 - the live stream
07:50 - um that is my friends over at brilliant
07:54 - i like to make video tutorials to teach
07:57 - interesting concepts
07:58 - in math and science and graphics and
08:00 - computers and all sorts of
08:02 - related things but if you would like to
08:04 - also learn those things
08:06 - through interactive lessons through
08:08 - puzzling it out yourself
08:10 - through a community of people also
08:11 - learning you can sign up and do that for
08:13 - free
08:14 - at brilliant.org codingtrain um
08:17 - there are also a whole set of courses
08:20 - that you can unlock it's a premium
08:21 - member of brilliant
08:22 - and if you sign up through that link the
08:24 - first 200 people to do so will receive
08:26 - 20 off so i'll come back a little later
08:28 - in the stream and look more at brilliant
08:30 - website
08:31 - but um i wanted to just uh start off by
08:34 - thanking brilliant
08:35 - now i don't have a plan for today
08:39 - um i am looking at the chat i'm seeing
08:42 - some great suggestions so here's the
08:44 - thing
08:44 - we are entering we being me you
08:48 - and uh whoever else is part of this
08:50 - engine
08:51 - um are entering a new phase in the life
08:54 - of the coding train because
08:57 - for me the summer is a very different
08:59 - time of year
09:00 - than the academic school year because i
09:03 - happen to have this
09:04 - full-time day job that i really should
09:06 - probably be working on right now
09:08 - um which is teaching at um new york
09:10 - university
09:11 - um there are two programs there our
09:13 - graduate program called itp an
09:14 - undergraduate program called ima most of
09:17 - the sequence tutorials that are on the
09:19 - channel
09:20 - are tutorials that i create for the
09:22 - courses that i teach there and then i
09:23 - also spend some time
09:25 - doing these live streams and other stuff
09:27 - here on the channel
09:28 - but the summer is approaching which
09:30 - means my day-to-day commitments
09:33 - lighten up quite a bit now i do like any
09:35 - of you i would expect
09:37 - also would like to enjoy the summer the
09:39 - beautiful weather i see the sun
09:41 - shining outside there's a cool breeze
09:43 - there's the the blooming
09:45 - plants are out i like to spend some time
09:47 - in my little garden here in brooklyn i
09:49 - like to go for a jog every once in a
09:51 - while so
09:52 - i have some children we've got a little
09:54 - league game tonight
09:55 - go rip tides um but um
09:58 - so while there might be some times over
10:00 - the summer i will take a break
10:02 - from this thing that i do here i also
10:04 - would like to just
10:05 - invest really in the coding trade
10:07 - community in making more videos and
10:09 - i think i really think what i need to
10:11 - get back to
10:13 - is the coding challenges it is probably
10:16 - the most
10:17 - watched the most requested the most
10:21 - if anything is beloved in any way shape
10:24 - or form
10:25 - it certainly is uh the most um
10:28 - enjoyed content that i produce so
10:31 - but interestingly enough so i today is a
10:32 - little bit of me trying to press the
10:34 - reset button a little bit i have no plan
10:36 - get organized i have a lot of lingering
10:39 - just projects that are just you know
10:42 - just
10:43 - twisting in the wind i think is really
10:45 - the expression one of which is the
10:47 - live poll software web application that
10:50 - i would like to revisit
10:52 - um and i'm looking at the chat and
10:56 - seeing all of your lovely messages
10:58 - thank you k weekman for um
11:01 - um uh compiling some of the suggestions
11:04 - and bringing them into the member
11:05 - discord
11:07 - um let's see here though but i do want
11:09 - to uh talk about something to one thing
11:10 - here
11:10 - a live bug report on the coding train
11:13 - website
11:14 - um this is not the latest video so the
11:16 - coding train website by the way which is
11:18 - going to have a relaunch
11:19 - that's a whole other topic to talk about
11:21 - which i will not but not for today for
11:23 - the future stay tuned
11:24 - uh i owe some people some emails back if
11:27 - any of you that i owe an email to about
11:28 - the relaunch of the website are watching
11:30 - i know i owe you that email it's after
11:33 - may 1st we were supposed to get started
11:35 - soon um so the website is supposed to um
11:39 - one of the things that i really struggle
11:41 - with
11:41 - is that i um you know i greatly benefit
11:45 - and appreciate
11:46 - youtube as a platform i don't think i'd
11:49 - be able to do
11:50 - what i'm doing right now without youtube
11:52 - or something
11:53 - in that vein there are many issues
11:56 - and criticisms that i have about youtube
12:00 - as a platform
12:00 - google perhaps as a company um you know
12:04 - um i'm still you can see here i'm using
12:05 - the chrome browser
12:07 - i'm i'm not perfect here i have not been
12:09 - able to extricate myself
12:10 - from just everything i use being google
12:12 - products
12:13 - but all that said one of the things that
12:16 - i
12:17 - really struggle with with youtube and
12:18 - just to pull up the channel here for a
12:20 - second
12:21 - is uh it's not a great place to organize
12:24 - a lot of sequence
12:25 - tutorial content so the website's goal
12:28 - is to do that
12:29 - so if you're new here by the way i just
12:31 - want to highlight this
12:33 - this is where you should begin if you
12:35 - want to learn code for the first time
12:37 - if you think that the p5.js javascript
12:40 - library
12:40 - could be the right framework and
12:42 - platform for you the coding trained
12:44 - videos
12:44 - appeal to your sensibility
12:48 - you're not severely irritated by me
12:50 - which you know
12:51 - some percentage of the audience is i i
12:53 - see you in the comments being severely
12:54 - irritated by my
12:56 - gestures and tangents and all that i get
12:58 - it i get it other people like it some
13:00 - people don't
13:00 - it's the way the world works um this is
13:03 - where you would want to start
13:05 - uh but live bug report here i don't know
13:06 - if we can fix this in real time
13:08 - if any of the uh managers of the website
13:12 - yeah uh managers of the website
13:15 - are um watching this should actually um
13:18 - show the most recent video which is
13:22 - uh this machine learning and the
13:25 - computer mouse
13:27 - so one of the things i want to mention
13:28 - about this video and i'm not going to uh
13:29 - play it for you
13:30 - uh let me know in the chat if you have
13:32 - not seen this video already i'm kind of
13:34 - curious
13:35 - how many people tune into the live
13:37 - streams found their way but
13:38 - don't necessarily watch some of the
13:40 - produced content that appears
13:43 - but this video is completely different
13:45 - than anything i ever made before
13:46 - i can just sort of scan through it you
13:48 - can see that it is more
13:50 - produced with some animations and i
13:52 - actually i'm reading from a script
13:54 - and various uh topics it was actually
13:56 - created for a conference called the
13:58 - computer mouse conference
14:00 - so one thing i am curious i wouldn't
14:02 - mind if i can get my live poll thing
14:03 - going
14:05 - to throw up a poll throw up a poll
14:08 - sounds a little bit odd
14:09 - to uh post a friendly poll
14:13 - for you to select your choice um
14:17 - if you appreciate it and like this style
14:19 - would like to see me
14:20 - make more videos like this or
14:24 - should i get back more to my roots which
14:26 - is ultimately kind of what i'm doing
14:28 - right now but just
14:29 - i press the button record i type of the
14:31 - code
14:33 - i make the mistakes and then eventually
14:36 - uh i press stop and then you watch it
14:39 - later at some point
14:40 - anyway i'm kind of curious about that
14:43 - i'm seeing i'm reading the chat here
14:45 - differential growth is a great
14:46 - suggestion
14:47 - hari uh says i haven't seen it yet um
14:50 - uh corey says i've been watching coding
14:52 - challenge but i haven't seen the most
14:53 - recent video
14:54 - um and luis says for me it's the
14:56 - opposite i barely catch a stream
14:58 - yeah that's um certainly i would say
15:00 - more um typical
15:02 - um null pointer says i prefer the
15:04 - organic nature of your videos to that
15:06 - scripted one but i still enjoyed it a
15:08 - lot yeah
15:08 - so i think my kind of um point of view
15:12 - about this
15:12 - at present is i really loved making this
15:15 - it was a tremendous amount of work and
15:17 - expense frankly um
15:21 - but um and so i would like to continue
15:23 - doing things like that but that's more
15:24 - of a once
15:25 - i mean at a maximum that's like a once a
15:27 - month kind of project
15:29 - um and i would like to keep going with
15:32 - the
15:32 - um it's not that i want to do a
15:36 - a quantity over quality but i think that
15:38 - i have a
15:40 - system for making what i hope is high
15:42 - quality
15:44 - low production value light editing uh
15:47 - videos
15:48 - so um yes and kobe is saying that the
15:50 - mouse conference got
15:51 - a separate tab under more and so the
15:54 - home page of the website
15:55 - uh has some code involved where i think
15:58 - it only pulls videos
15:59 - that are from the coding challenges
16:01 - coding cabana so that would be something
16:02 - we would have to
16:03 - fix but it's right here and you can see
16:05 - actually i need to embed the video on
16:07 - this page but all the code but one of
16:09 - the things that i really wanted to show
16:10 - you
16:11 - and let me just switch just to um i'm
16:13 - going to take myself out of the picture
16:15 - here
16:15 - i'm going to open up this um
16:20 - oh now i've lost it um i thought it was
16:22 - this but
16:23 - no this is the actual video but not the
16:25 - final one
16:27 - where did i put this on my mess of a
16:29 - desktop here
16:31 - uh yes this is what i'm looking for no
16:34 - so what i wanted to just quickly i'm
16:36 - just going to quickly play this for you
16:37 - then i might
16:37 - talk through some of it this is a quick
16:40 - um
16:41 - this is a quick behind-the-scenes um
16:44 - little
16:44 - 30-second video that uh matia who does
16:48 - all the editing for the coding train
16:49 - helped put together
16:50 - to show how we created the effect
16:53 - of the desktop kind of living in the
16:56 - garden with me
16:57 - walking behind it and back in front of
16:59 - it although it doesn't actually show
17:00 - that
17:01 - walking behind it thing but you'll get
17:02 - the idea here all right so let me just
17:04 - uh
17:04 - play this for you
17:19 - [Music]
17:37 - so i don't know if that was uh
17:39 - self-explanatory enough but basically
17:41 - what this is is it's not a it's not me
17:44 - standing in front of a green screen i am
17:46 - actually standing outside um in
17:49 - the this garden space and you can see
17:52 - the raw footage of the garden looks like
17:54 - this
17:54 - but this is a particular technology from
17:57 - a company that i refer to quite often
17:59 - i'm an
18:00 - advisor to this company was founded by
18:03 - some
18:03 - alums of the program where i teach
18:04 - called runwayml
18:07 - and runwayml has some ai driven
18:10 - video tools one of which is called a
18:13 - green screen
18:14 - and so what green screen allows you to
18:16 - do and it doesn't have to be just for
18:17 - people
18:18 - most of the demos show people but it
18:20 - allows you to take a particular video
18:23 - click various key points so that's me
18:25 - kind of like click well i'm not actually
18:27 - doing this mateo was doing this clicking
18:28 - key points on the body and you could see
18:30 - the ai then tries to recognize the
18:32 - object now
18:33 - it didn't recognize the music stand but
18:36 - we also want to key out the music stance
18:38 - so one of the things that's wonderful
18:39 - about this tool
18:40 - is you can then click on that item and
18:43 - it's going to uh
18:44 - generate and then it generates a mask
18:46 - and then so we're able to generate a
18:48 - mask much like a green screen and not
18:50 - you know you can you can see there's
18:51 - some rough edges some slight
18:53 - imperfections
18:54 - but for having this in terms of if any
18:56 - of you have ever done any
18:57 - manual rotoscoping the amount of time it
19:00 - would take
19:01 - to do this at this level of quality even
19:04 - uh would be a tremendous amount of time
19:05 - i don't got this
19:06 - marvel uh uh visual effects department
19:09 - budget over here so
19:11 - um once we have that um i record screen
19:13 - recorded a lot of visual imagery um
19:16 - on as a just screen recording the
19:18 - desktop but left the
19:19 - desktop background the sort of perfect
19:21 - green color so that could be keyed out
19:23 - as a layer
19:24 - over the garden video and
19:27 - then after that
19:30 - you can see here like we can then take
19:32 - the masked version of me
19:34 - and layer that over so what's wonderful
19:37 - about
19:38 - this is even though there are some
19:39 - slight imperfections in the key when
19:42 - there's something else behind it
19:44 - like because it's the actual footage the
19:46 - uh
19:48 - there's no imperfection here because
19:49 - this is actually just the real footage
19:51 - it's the garden and me
19:53 - so um i'm seeing a lot of
19:56 - nobody seems to be responding to what
19:58 - i'm talking about in the chat
19:59 - but uh i hopefully you find this
20:01 - somewhat interesting and um you you can
20:03 - check out this tool yourself
20:05 - i'm going to runwayml.com so i wanted to
20:08 - mention that
20:08 - i wanted to encourage you to check out
20:11 - the mouse conference video
20:13 - also uh just to be uh frank here you
20:15 - should uh
20:17 - you really shouldn't watch my video what
20:19 - you should do is go to
20:23 - computermouseconference.net
20:25 - i want to click on this page here so
20:28 - it's
20:28 - complicating the
20:30 - complicatingthecomputermouse.net
20:32 - archived here this is the full um
20:35 - video of the conference with all the
20:37 - talks so i would really
20:39 - just kind of just scan through them oh
20:42 - this is me
20:43 - often just so ridiculous composed of
20:45 - rubber binded too so i really would
20:47 - recommend all of the archive of this
20:49 - conference
20:50 - um the panels were amazing there's this
20:53 - really cool
20:53 - chat system that you can read back over
20:56 - here it's just like
20:57 - it has all this wonderful ascii art in
20:59 - it so
21:00 - um i really um i really would encourage
21:03 - you to check out complicated computer
21:05 - mouse conference
21:06 - i try to really really be selective
21:09 - about participating in conferences
21:10 - because it creates a tremendous amount
21:13 - of
21:13 - stress for me and it takes up a huge
21:16 - amount of time
21:17 - and uh yeah i'd frankly just like to be
21:19 - making videos and teaching my classes so
21:21 - but
21:21 - the computer mouse conference is such a
21:23 - wonderful event i was so honored to be
21:25 - invited i also just want to mention that
21:27 - um nedo bomani an artist created uh did
21:30 - a live stream on the coding train
21:32 - making a zine um and if you missed that
21:35 - i'm just gonna there's no audio here
21:37 - i'll just play this for you really
21:38 - quickly
21:39 - this is i haven't released this anywhere
21:41 - yet but this is just a quick
21:42 - um uh time-lapse video of the entire
21:46 - um zine making process it's about a
21:48 - minute and 30 seconds
21:50 - so um neda created basically a page in
21:52 - the scene for every talk
21:54 - of course by coincidence as if
21:58 - as if this was planned um we had a a
22:01 - technology issue during the time when
22:03 - she was making
22:04 - the page for my talk so you won't see
22:06 - that appear but there's a page for every
22:08 - other
22:09 - um um every other
22:12 - um speaker and panelist i believe at the
22:15 - conference
22:16 - um and um i'm going i don't know we'll
22:18 - put this somewhere on social media where
22:20 - you can sort of see this whole process
22:22 - um is really kind of incredible uh
22:25 - definitely something that i aspire to to
22:26 - think about
22:27 - what kinds of creative live streaming
22:29 - can i do
22:31 - um that's not just you know typing code
22:34 - and software um and this was really
22:36 - amazing i want to let this full thing
22:38 - play out for a second
22:42 - we'll just i don't have any music to
22:43 - play so enjoy the
22:45 - silence for a moment
22:51 - i can't let the silence go a lot of the
22:53 - things that neta was printing and
22:54 - cutting out were
22:55 - submissions by people who are watching
22:57 - the live stream
23:01 - um i just the end is my favorite and
23:03 - there you go look at this beautiful
23:05 - that's the
23:05 - look at this beautiful like beautiful
23:08 - beautiful object that was created over
23:10 - seven or eight hours during the course
23:11 - of the conference that's just all in a
23:13 - minute and a half
23:15 - okay um so um
23:19 - what's happening now i've got to get to
23:21 - something here let's i've seen
23:23 - so many wonderful suggestions in the
23:25 - chat before
23:27 - um i start to look at the um putting up
23:30 - a poll
23:30 - and trying to start maybe programming
23:32 - one of those suggestions i want to do
23:34 - two things
23:35 - i want to revisit my
23:38 - rainbow topics repository
23:42 - um there's wonderful suggestions of
23:45 - different things to look at here
23:47 - and what i would actually like to do is
23:50 - go here i believe at the
23:52 - what i've been doing is at the beginning
23:54 - of every kind of
23:55 - academic term like i'm sort of dividing
23:57 - the year up into
23:58 - fall 2020 spring 2021 now we're out to
24:02 - summer 2021.
24:03 - i would like to look at this markdown
24:05 - file
24:07 - and i'm just going to click edit i'm
24:10 - going to grab
24:11 - all of the text for it i'll leave that
24:14 - intact and i'm going to now make a new
24:17 - file whoops we're going to call it oops
24:20 - nope
24:22 - call it summer
24:26 - 2021 dot mark down
24:29 - and i'm just going to paste in what i
24:31 - had there before
24:32 - so let's start to look and eliminate
24:36 - things that i've already done now i have
24:39 - to one thing that's kind of unfortunate
24:40 - and i
24:41 - this is all on me is there's a huge
24:43 - backlog
24:44 - of things that i've done that i haven't
24:46 - actually published as videos so
24:48 - good news for all of you i suppose um if
24:51 - i if it once i get my act together and
24:52 - hopefully that's gonna happen this month
24:54 - especially now that the semester is
24:55 - winding down and
24:56 - that conference is over there's five uh
24:59 - videos for nature of code
25:01 - three videos for intro to programming
25:03 - with p5 and
25:04 - one coding challenge all of which yet to
25:07 - be released on the channel
25:08 - so if i math there's close to 10 videos
25:11 - that have yet to be released
25:13 - um and um i'm getting a great suggestion
25:17 - and body simulation that's really not
25:18 - something i've done before
25:20 - but let's let me look through this and
25:22 - i'm the summer is not the time for me to
25:24 - focus
25:25 - on the sequenced tutorials that's really
25:27 - the academic year stuff for me although
25:29 - it would be nice to make some progress
25:31 - to have them ready but i believe i did
25:34 - and anyone on the uh uh any i don't i
25:37 - believe i did and maybe some of the
25:38 - members who have
25:39 - tuned in for some of my recording
25:40 - sessions ah
25:42 - blender 3d that's also oh i gotta like
25:45 - uh
25:45 - i really want to learn blender my son is
25:48 - like
25:49 - a whiz at photoshop and video editing i
25:52 - discovered like i was trying to do
25:53 - and like i feel like he would really
25:54 - take to blender um and so
25:57 - um don't worry matthew you're not gonna
25:59 - be out of work yet he's pretty good at
26:00 - video editing but i think
26:01 - we can still need you um um but i
26:05 - i i did 2.1 to 2.5 so i'm gonna take
26:08 - that out
26:09 - i did uh all of chapter three
26:13 - i can take that out
26:16 - um chapter four i have done
26:20 - chapter five i have done
26:23 - but there could be more
26:28 - um
26:28 - [Music]
26:32 - the these i do
26:35 - need to do machine learning this is very
26:37 - important to me this is very important i
26:39 - guess i haven't done this
26:40 - as a video uh never got around to these
26:43 - express stop videos that's another
26:45 - i recorded a pilot of this idea of like
26:48 - a short
26:49 - uh one one to two minute video
26:51 - explaining a concept i suppose i should
26:52 - just be on tick tock now doing that
26:54 - so these all oh and i did um
26:57 - template literals is what i did um i
27:00 - guess uh
27:00 - i guess i could do this kind of just to
27:04 - indicate that
27:05 - discord bot i never finished those
27:08 - so those that should still be there uh
27:11 - coding challenges
27:12 - um yeah so this is what should go at the
27:14 - top here
27:16 - i did update this this library but i
27:19 - never did it in a video
27:21 - but i'm gonna that's gonna uh just go
27:23 - away
27:24 - uh i really wanna start working with uh
27:27 - vinyl cutting and a plotter
27:29 - uh learn a blender
27:34 - i did see a comment um from something
27:36 - about learn
27:37 - learning unity you know i'm it's a
27:40 - little silly for me to say this given
27:42 - a lot of the commercial tools that i do
27:44 - use uh on a daily basis
27:46 - and also in my videos but i prefer if at
27:49 - all possible to use
27:51 - um open source free uh tools
27:54 - and unity i suppose is kind of on the
27:56 - borderline there it's not open source i
27:58 - don't know what extent it's free
28:00 - but blender feels to me like in the
28:01 - spirit of p5 and processing
28:04 - um okay um so
28:07 - uh so let's go back up here coding
28:10 - challenges
28:11 - um i saw some good uh good ones that i
28:14 - will just
28:15 - like kind of roll out here right now so
28:17 - um
28:19 - i i think i'm not going to differentiate
28:21 - what's a coding challenge versus a
28:23 - cabana video
28:24 - fractal flame is like my number one
28:27 - you know the white whale so to speak for
28:28 - me right now um
28:31 - people are saying um uh
28:34 - tower of hanoi a tetris is one i've
28:37 - always wanted to do
28:38 - we could do that this summer sometime
28:41 - let's make a list uh aunt colony um
28:44 - do i i have langston's aunt already
28:48 - um so um if that's what it's called
28:52 - uh i'm looking at image to ascii it's a
28:56 - great idea image to ascii
28:58 - that's a fun one lava lamp coding
29:01 - challenges
29:02 - c sound um uh
29:05 - yeah so i guess i could do it as a
29:06 - coding challenge like basic
29:08 - like simple queue learning table like
29:11 - non-deep learning
29:13 - that feels like that could be a good
29:14 - coding challenge
29:16 - um slime mold simulation
29:21 - uh sebastian lag
29:25 - um uh react to make a gui for p5
29:29 - sketches
29:30 - if that's really wanted by the audience
29:33 - i kind of want to get back to
29:34 - just the here's an interesting algorithm
29:37 - here's how it makes a pretty picture
29:39 - please go make it prettier make it
29:41 - interactive do do with it what you will
29:43 - so i'm a little bit more
29:44 - interested in that right now than some
29:46 - of the more utilitarian content but
29:49 - i'm not opposed to that langdon's aunt
29:51 - did i say langston
29:53 - p5 glitch library would be interesting
29:55 - to explore
29:56 - uh for sure um okay 2d
30:00 - platformer game shaders
30:03 - shaders shaders by the way there is an
30:05 - incredible
30:06 - live stream um uh by
30:09 - uh i don't know if she's still watching
30:11 - the coding train but she was uh i would
30:13 - see her in the chat here and there eliza
30:15 - sj um i know that shar styles has been
30:18 - appearing as a guest and maybe eliza sj
30:20 - has a does anybody know what i'm talking
30:21 - about this shader streaming on twitch
30:24 - uh for your transform with deep learning
30:26 - mandelbrot
30:27 - set ray marching ascii rotating cube
30:30 - forward circles i don't know what that
30:31 - is 2d platformer
30:34 - i mean a 2d platformer i sort of have i
30:38 - not done anything like that
30:40 - falling sand i like that
30:43 - uh open simplex noise i have a video i
30:45 - mean i have a video where i use it in p5
30:47 - flutter yeah that's another not so not
30:50 - so interested right now
30:52 - uh freya homer has a lot of stuff on
30:54 - shaders grain graphics and similar stuff
30:56 - thank you for that next
30:57 - excellent um uh asteroids game i do have
31:00 - one already
31:01 - a connect five well i do want to do
31:03 - connect four also i saw that um
31:06 - um stand up maths had um something about
31:10 - spot it which is maybe called like
31:11 - doppel in the uk
31:13 - but um that could be fun to do
31:17 - um uh i don't um um five okay
31:21 - run one it's a 3d platformer
31:24 - okay that's interesting run one
31:27 - okay um
31:30 - math equation to graph all right i think
31:32 - i've got a good list here
31:35 - of some things that came up um let me
31:37 - also
31:38 - just go over to
31:42 - uh issues because one of the things that
31:44 - i do so you can post ideas here
31:46 - um with the read with the relaunch of
31:49 - the website maybe
31:50 - part of that will be a new tool to take
31:52 - suggestions but one of the things oh
31:54 - sudoku
31:56 - yeah i really um
32:00 - sudoku i would love to do whether it's
32:03 - just generate puzzles
32:05 - and or solve them that i would love to
32:08 - do
32:08 - but um one of the things that i do
32:12 - is i will often um
32:15 - assign them to myself if i see it as
32:17 - something interesting
32:19 - so um wave function collapse i remember
32:22 - that as being a thing uh wave
32:26 - function collapse
32:30 - slide puzzle i love that idea
32:32 - [Music]
32:34 - that's a oh auto encoder
32:39 - is something i really want to learn how
32:41 - to do mathematical marbling
32:44 - sure why not i don't remember what that
32:45 - was but that sounds cool
32:48 - uh pie challenge i gave marching squares
32:50 - marching cubes i did that derom
32:52 - [Music]
32:54 - curve
32:56 - um where i lost where i am durham curve
33:00 - i should be linking to these but that's
33:02 - okay fibonacci spiral spacex pie music
33:05 - these are a lot of pie things quad trees
33:07 - load bites these are old things that i
33:09 - think i'm
33:10 - fractal flame though i really want to do
33:12 - that ulum spiral
33:14 - i don't know why this like i'm um
33:17 - ascii art generator has always been one
33:19 - okay i've got a good list here i'm just
33:21 - taking a peek at the chat
33:23 - uh chess 3dl system trees with
33:27 - procedural
33:27 - i did 2048 already do have a whole video
33:30 - series about that
33:32 - um dobbles that's what it's called yes
33:35 - spot it
33:36 - uh dobble yeah
33:40 - so okay um
33:43 - all right so this is good i'm gonna hit
33:45 - save on this this is a nice kind of set
33:47 - of goals
33:48 - for the summer i really want my focus to
33:51 - be
33:52 - this kind of content um we'll see how i
33:55 - do
33:58 - um but that's that's that all right
34:02 - what's next uh i would like to look at
34:04 - some community contributions
34:06 - because i haven't done that for a while
34:07 - and i do have my community contributions
34:09 - theme song
34:12 - yes that's right you the viewers of the
34:15 - coding train
34:16 - periodically watch the videos and make
34:18 - your own projects based on
34:20 - the content that i make because i create
34:23 - content
34:24 - i create the content the content is
34:26 - created by me
34:28 - that is what i love to think of myself
34:29 - as a content creator
34:32 - that's the worst term ever everybody
34:34 - hates it can we come up with something
34:35 - else
34:36 - um so is this music too loud
34:40 - so let's go to
34:44 - so what what am i talking about here if
34:45 - i go to any one of my recent videos
34:49 - we can see here things that people have
34:52 - made
34:53 - related to the particular video and i
34:56 - could
34:57 - click on challenges just
34:59 - [Music]
35:00 - oh let's uh let's get a random number
35:02 - let's do it let's do it this way
35:03 - let's get a random number if only i had
35:06 - some way of getting random numbers right
35:08 - ah if only i had some way of getting
35:10 - random numbers between
35:11 - 1 and 161
35:15 - [Music]
35:23 - uh allow allow allow
35:30 - here we go
35:31 - [Music]
35:36 - now i can't by the way i've lost my book
35:38 - i have no idea where it is
35:41 - it's somewhere in this house i don't
35:43 - know where it is so i don't have it
35:44 - today
35:46 - i do have the bell
35:49 - 69
35:52 - i hate the universe the universe is the
35:56 - worst
35:59 - [Music]
36:01 - 85 that'll be edited out later
36:04 - let's go to coding challenge 85.
36:08 - the internet why internet
36:15 - what's 85 i used to do so many of these
36:22 - here we go oh game of life this is a
36:24 - good one
36:27 - this is a good one
36:31 - all right now whoa we've got a lot of
36:34 - great ones all right
36:35 - all right everybody all right so this is
36:38 - one two three four five six seven eight
36:40 - nine ten eleven twelve
36:42 - thirty forty fifteen sixteen the
36:43 - seventeen
36:45 - if i counted that correctly let's give
36:47 - us a random number
36:49 - between one and seventeen
36:59 - number four
37:04 - one two three four the greg of life oh
37:07 - this is kind of awesome first of all
37:09 - greg brilliant title i love that this is
37:12 - called the greg
37:13 - of life that's totally amazing everybody
37:16 - should have their own
37:17 - the your first name of life or whatever
37:20 - name you so choose
37:21 - okay um whoa this must be greg
37:25 - i assume with a bunch of different
37:27 - expressions
37:29 - and then i can do gender step forward
37:32 - i actually have not seen this one this
37:35 - is so brilliant
37:38 - oh that is amazing oh greg
37:42 - uh i could just watch this all day this
37:44 - is so
37:45 - fun and bizarre now am i right that it's
37:47 - different expressions or am i imagining
37:49 - that
37:50 - let's zoom in on this again let's do
37:52 - pause
37:53 - like look here yeah these are definitely
37:56 - different i don't know how many there
37:58 - are
37:58 - but these are distinctly different
38:02 - expressions
38:05 - great job greg it's pretty awesome
38:10 - um all right let's look for
38:14 - one more on this page
38:17 - number 16 is well if i counted correctly
38:21 - would be this one
38:21 - simple game of life by unoriginal pun
38:29 - click where you want to activate or
38:30 - deactivate cells
38:32 - c to swap one oh cool
38:36 - oh i love that so this is really cool
38:38 - there's something in the game of life
38:39 - there are various
38:40 - repeating patterns so first of all if
38:42 - you don't know what the game of life is
38:43 - boy do i have good news for you i've got
38:45 - a whole video about it you can take a
38:47 - look at it it's probably about 45
38:48 - minutes long
38:49 - um it is a cellular automata system it's
38:52 - a cellular automaton
38:54 - and what that means is there is a system
38:56 - of cells each cell has a state in this
38:58 - case just on or off
39:00 - white or black and its new state is
39:03 - based on
39:04 - um what its neighbor state um
39:07 - what its neighbor state are so states
39:10 - are
39:10 - so um and
39:14 - um there are some well-known patterns
39:15 - one of which is called a glider
39:17 - and it looks like um through key presses
39:20 - i can kind of add gliders to this
39:22 - simulation and watch it
39:23 - uh play out great work i love that c to
39:26 - swap color oh
39:28 - interesting i kind of like it this way
39:30 - it was uh kind of a big glare there
39:33 - so great work um
39:37 - terrific um great work all right let's
39:40 - go for um i want to i'm giving myself
39:43 - till like just like
39:44 - five more minutes so let's go back to
39:47 - uh what was the maximum coding challenge
39:49 - again it was like 183
39:52 - um 161 i don't know where i got 183 from
39:57 - my brain
39:58 - is completely non-functional these days
40:00 - uh let's try this again coding challenge
40:02 - number
40:05 - 12. oh that's going to be an oldie oh
40:08 - throwback time uh
40:11 - let's go to coding challenge number
40:18 - one two three four five six
40:21 - seven eight nine ten ten ten 10 10 11
40:24 - 12.
40:24 - ooh the lorenz attractor all right let's
40:27 - take a look at this to the challenge we
40:29 - go
40:29 - and we've got three we've got three two
40:33 - by one carlos i'm surprised by the way
40:35 - that this coding challenge only has
40:37 - three contributions associated with it
40:39 - because this is quite a um i think
40:42 - uh quite ripe for the reinvention for
40:45 - the for putting your own
40:47 - uh twist on it so i i feel a little
40:49 - silly uh
40:50 - picking a random between one and three
40:52 - let's just look at all three of these
40:53 - um so here we have whoa okay
40:57 - that is cool so these are particles
41:01 - moving along the path there is a
41:05 - whole there uh so this is just the
41:08 - lorenz attractor pattern which
41:10 - presumably if i
41:11 - when i made that video i created this um
41:14 - but i did not do it in such a way with
41:16 - thinking about color and putting
41:17 - particles to move along it now these i
41:20 - guess if i
41:20 - uncheck this now i don't see the
41:22 - particles this is also a nice
41:24 - 3d scene that i can rotate around that
41:27 - is
41:27 - really amazing oh so pretty
41:31 - let's put the particles back what's
41:33 - compared to ah
41:36 - oh compare draws the
41:39 - lorenz attractor like sort of expands it
41:42 - out as a path
41:43 - that is really cool and i could take the
41:45 - particles out
41:47 - oh but there's compare there's are there
41:48 - two going on here
41:51 - i thought i saw two no maybe not so i
41:53 - don't know what's the
41:54 - what is the um rule by which the color
41:58 - changes ah yeah there are two
42:00 - so they're slightly different i see so
42:03 - they're slightly different initial
42:05 - conditions
42:06 - the initial conditions here there you
42:07 - know there's these three variables one
42:09 - is 2.00
42:10 - one is 2.05 so this is kind of the
42:13 - theory
42:13 - of a chaotic system this so-called
42:16 - butterfly effect
42:18 - uh tiny changes in initial conditions
42:21 - result in large global
42:24 - changes um so i can hit randomize
42:27 - i see and then we get ah it's just
42:30 - randomized i try different initial
42:31 - conditions
42:32 - this is really cool uh preset
42:35 - is what it started as uh butterflies
42:40 - um oh it just has butterflies like going
42:44 - along the path
42:46 - i love that that is really wild this is
42:49 - amazing
42:50 - open controls uh curve
42:53 - animate curve butterflies uh preset i
42:58 - lost the um
43:00 - let me just refresh the page oh wow is
43:04 - it like using
43:05 - local storage to remember
43:08 - ah that's kind of nuts um and can
43:12 - i change these parameters at all guess
43:14 - not i don't know what's going on here
43:16 - um
43:21 - i don't know what to do oh i went to a
43:22 - different page for the butterflies
43:24 - that's why it was a different page for
43:26 - the butterflies got it
43:27 - okay this is amazing i could play with
43:29 - this all day um
43:31 - i am super impressed uh thank you to
43:34 - juan carlos for this
43:35 - amazing contribution um and i think we
43:38 - just actually saw the third one which is
43:40 - the lorenz attractor with butterflies
43:41 - by the way just to look at like what is
43:43 - the actual code from the challenge
43:45 - the code from the challenge is just this
43:49 - um i i guess i have the um the orbit
43:52 - controls or something
43:53 - and this is actually i think i did this
43:54 - in processing so this port
43:56 - is thank you to whoever did this port um
43:59 - but you can see um that the code to the
44:02 - actual challenge is quite simple
44:04 - it's is much simpler it's just the basic
44:06 - pattern okay
44:07 - let's look at alejo
44:10 - cortinas lorenz attractor resolume arena
44:14 - plugin
44:14 - i have no idea what that means let's
44:17 - click on it to see
44:20 - so this is the repository of a resolume
44:22 - arena plug-in using processing
44:25 - and the lorenz attractor
44:29 - i don't know what this plug-in is does
44:30 - anybody know
44:33 - so this is um what is
44:37 - this
44:40 - it's like a media server oh interesting
44:43 - for
44:44 - like vj software interesting that's
44:46 - really cool so maybe this is some way of
44:49 - getting your processing visualization
44:51 - into this other software that you can
44:53 - use to sort vj
44:54 - a concert or a party pretty interesting
44:58 - um gjk
45:02 - collision detection algorithm
45:05 - um is a is a suggestion that's coming oh
45:07 - wolfram
45:08 - so i do want to do a video on the
45:11 - wolfram elementary ca
45:13 - um that is vj software thank you to
45:16 - um joss in the chat
45:20 - more ideas from stig okay i got i'm
45:23 - gonna add more ideas um
45:24 - later let me move on i have one minute
45:27 - left in my community contributions
45:29 - section on let's this probably needs an
45:31 - update but let me go over to discord
45:33 - real quick
45:34 - we're going to get one more in i am
45:36 - going to type in the bot command wheel
45:39 - and that's going to bring me the reason
45:41 - why i didn't go to this first
45:43 - is i feel like this hasn't been updated
45:44 - in a while but this is actually a wheel
45:47 - and i can spin this wheel
45:48 - [Music]
45:50 - a wheel of contribution that i should
45:53 - get one
45:54 - is called look here
45:58 - and look here is also by uh
46:01 - jay ponce uh i already looked at one of
46:03 - jay ponce's contributions
46:06 - uh so in a way i feel like i should pick
46:07 - another one but uh i have seen this one
46:09 - this is really cool
46:10 - so i have a video about purlin noise
46:12 - loops
46:13 - uh and making these sort of blobby
46:14 - patterns with them i remember seeing
46:16 - this one now
46:17 - okay let's try to get one more let's
46:19 - spin this wheel again
46:20 - [Music]
46:24 - kotch and i know it's not pronounced
46:26 - koch but that's just how i have to say
46:28 - it right now
46:29 - uh ah unrog is that a rock watching
46:32 - uh anurag is a regular viewer of the
46:35 - coding train
46:36 - uh let's see uh we've got the uh and
46:39 - we've got
46:39 - again i should probably learn uh how to
46:43 - use this
46:44 - wonderful.gui javascript library which
46:47 - allows
46:48 - a lot of just a quick way to create an
46:51 - interface to play with a lot of
46:52 - parameters
46:53 - in a visualization algorithm okay
46:55 - everyone
46:58 - i can close all these out and we are
47:00 - going to move on to
47:02 - our next segment which is
47:08 - where you the viewer vote on
47:12 - the thing that i will do in the second
47:14 - half of this live stream
47:16 - to launch the summer the summer of the
47:20 - coding challenge
47:25 - oh this is going smashingly well today
47:29 - all right so
47:38 - so i'm looking here i have this uh
47:41 - project that i began on a live stream
47:44 - many moons ago
47:45 - um and uh various contributors have
47:49 - if i go here and look uh at the
47:52 - history here various contributors
47:56 - have
47:57 - [Music]
48:01 - added a whole bunch of things and
48:02 - features and visual ideas
48:04 - and the idea for this is that it is a
48:06 - system by which i can
48:08 - spin up a poll
48:11 - i can uh send the link out of the poll
48:15 - to the chat and then i can watch the
48:17 - results come in live
48:18 - as an overlay on my live stream
48:22 - so let's and i haven't looked at this
48:26 - probably in about six months uh january
48:28 - february march april may
48:30 - you know five months four months four or
48:31 - five months so
48:33 - i already have it um
48:36 - cloned here onto my desktop
48:40 - let me run npm uh can i just say npm
48:43 - start is that how you do it
48:45 - so now i've got the uh poll running
48:49 - and all right so what i would like to do
48:52 - now
48:52 - whoops is create a poll
48:59 - okay but we're going to attempt this
49:03 - summer all right we're going to do may
49:06 - what's today's date
49:08 - 7th may 7th
49:11 - 2021 live all right so let's
49:14 - pull a few of the options from
49:18 - uh of something and something that i
49:20 - might begin to
49:21 - explore so today it's just this is just
49:24 - a trial run an experiment
49:26 - an exploration if you will um so
49:29 - if i go back to um
49:34 - uh rainbow topics
49:38 - and i go to my summer 2021 file
49:42 - and let's see like one of these um so
49:45 - this i could definitely begin to explore
49:46 - today fractal flame
49:49 - um i could begin to explore the idea of
49:51 - doing tetris today
49:53 - i like this image to ascii uh
49:57 - uh the slime old simulation i'm
49:59 - interested in i'm just picking a bunch
50:01 - uh i'm getting
50:04 - uh shaders not today 2d platformer not
50:07 - today
50:08 - falling sand connect4 again i'm um
50:12 - let's oh can i not have more options i
50:15 - only get five options okay that's a
50:17 - feature i need
50:18 - well simon's gonna be very upset if i
50:20 - don't put generator functions in here
50:22 - let's put uh generator functions um
50:25 - and let me let's hit create and see what
50:27 - happens here all right
50:29 - so now
50:32 - here's my poll and
50:35 - uh i'm going to switch over here for a
50:38 - second
50:39 - and i'm going to see if i can
50:42 - um get this as an overlay so i want to
50:46 - know what is my local ip now
50:48 - i realize that i have to figure out a
50:49 - way for all of you to vote i've got a
50:50 - plan don't worry um
50:55 - oh and body simulation would have been a
50:57 - good one for me to
50:58 - um to add
51:02 - uh all right so hold on this is this is
51:05 - not science this is this is just
51:06 - figuring out the live poll
51:08 - this is not the final poll this is just
51:10 - seeing if the poll this is like a
51:12 - metapol
51:13 - a trial run of the poll itself
51:20 - so i am going to my system preferences
51:25 - and i am looking for my ip address
51:29 - [Music]
51:30 - i don't think it matters if anybody sees
51:33 - it but i'm just looking for my local ip
51:50 - [Music]
51:59 - keyboard number two
52:16 - here oh it's loud okay thank you
52:23 - um
52:26 - real serious stuff i'm doing here
52:35 - oh wait okay hold on
52:41 - hold on i know what i need to do here
52:51 - [Music]
52:54 - oh 196. no wonder
53:00 - this site can't provide a secure
53:02 - connection
53:04 - uh all right
53:08 - let's not do it this way um
53:17 - um don't worry everyone
53:21 - things are gonna happen you're gonna see
53:24 - got it got it got it got it got it got
53:26 - it

53:57 - everything's going to be fine
54:01 - all right i'm getting there
54:04 - okay why is the background not a
54:07 - transparent
54:08 - toggle overlay mode but i can't interact
54:12 - with it
54:14 - i can't interact with this page in obs
54:16 - so this has a whole
54:17 - like interface but um
54:20 - all right we're gonna do it this way um
54:25 - uh transform reset transform
54:28 - no no you silly not of the camera
54:31 - oh i messed up this thing
54:39 - transform uh reset transform
54:42 - there we go uh
54:48 - let's uh how's this for live streaming
54:52 - entertainment um crop this
54:55 - out here
54:59 - i can't click on that in obs so i need a
55:01 - way of so this
55:02 - i'm now realizing some features that i
55:03 - need okay so in a moment i'm going to
55:05 - give you the place to vote
55:08 - um i am going to somebody could
55:12 - so it is a poll so i want to go to
55:16 - the vote link okay hold on everyone
55:21 - uh wait where did i post that
55:29 - did it get deleted no i wanted it there
55:31 - did someone delete my message thinking
55:32 - that i
55:33 - didn't want to put it there i want to
55:34 - put it there because i need it that's
55:35 - how i go back and forth
55:36 - between the computers you're all welcome
55:39 - to it
55:40 - in the members channel now i lost it i
55:41 - have to get it again
55:47 - i don't want to post it in links yet i'm
55:48 - not ready for that this is
55:50 - we're trying this trial run okay now
55:53 - we're going to get this url and go to
55:55 - vote
55:57 - instead
56:01 - no oh
56:05 - uh vote
56:10 - okay now what you are seeing here
56:15 - is the page and this link can now if
56:17 - anybody wants to put it
56:18 - i want it to vote first i'll vote for
56:21 - fractal flame
56:23 - got one vote and if i go back to here
56:25 - there we go
56:27 - so at the moment what should happen is
56:30 - as soon as i post this link
56:34 - for people to vote and you're looking
56:37 - for the discord link here it is i'll
56:38 - post it in
56:39 - discord and somebody can
56:43 - so the place by the way if you're not in
56:44 - the coding train discord you should join
56:46 - right now
56:47 - um and i'm gonna post here in the links
56:50 - uh channel
56:51 - the place where you can vote oops it
56:53 - needs to be not poll
56:54 - vote so i'm pretty sure
56:58 - that this is now the url for you to
57:00 - click on and if i go back here
57:02 - the votes should start coming in um if
57:05 - somebody could cross-post this
57:06 - it was a moderator into the youtube chat
57:08 - that would be great
57:14 - and we'll see if the internet is
57:15 - friendly to me today
57:17 - or if people decide to like destroy
57:20 - everything that i worked so hard for
57:22 - fractal flame is really winning out here
57:35 - i'm ready for the votes to come in
57:40 - wrong link
57:48 - all right everybody
57:52 - whoops
57:54 - [Music]
58:09 - all right what's going wrong everybody
58:12 - why
58:15 - why can you not vote okay so i'm gonna
58:18 - go
58:19 - back to
58:23 - me here this is go to vote
58:28 - uh well i've already voted maybe that's
58:30 - why
58:35 - it should be that i just change
58:38 - let's go to an incognito window
58:48 - huh
58:55 - so what am i missing here everybody
59:00 - i was able to vote does it only take one
59:02 - vote
59:04 - is there some kind of uh
59:16 - pull
59:26 - yeah why is it redirecting to the poll
59:30 - link
59:37 - um i'm reading the chat here
59:46 - uh
59:51 - coding challenge fix yeah yeah i'm using
59:55 - ngrok just to host it because i don't
59:57 - feel like deploying it right now
59:59 - and i don't understand why
60:04 - um it's not allowing me to go to the
60:07 - vote
60:09 - go to vote let's go to this one yeah
60:11 - this one
60:12 - see how if you go to the vote and the id
60:17 - so sing let's hit yes
60:20 - and then if i go back to vote yeah
60:24 - once i voted i can never get there again
60:29 - why is that all right we're gonna have
60:31 - to i guess debug this
60:41 - no the point of this is this has to work
60:43 - this this has to be a project that gets
60:45 - finished
60:46 - that i can use regularly i guess i could
60:48 - just work on it and test it
60:51 - um outside of live streaming because now
60:53 - it is noon and i have completely failed
60:56 - um but i don't understand why
60:59 - uh why this is happening and i guess i
61:02 - could look at the code
61:04 - um let's let's look at what's going on
61:06 - here
61:08 - all right uh
61:13 - let's see here um
61:19 - like there should be a vote route
61:26 - where is create
61:30 - newest
61:34 - oh i can always go to newest i forgot
61:36 - about that pull pull
61:37 - id vote pull id
61:42 - ah if i have voted uh redirect
61:46 - to this all right that's i guess to like
61:48 - keep you only voting once but it's not
61:50 - working
61:55 - yeah why is engroc is the problem
62:00 - interesting so this protection to keep
62:03 - you from only voting once
62:06 - is an issue because everyone it thinks
62:08 - everyone is the same person because i'm
62:10 - using ngrok
62:11 - so really i should deploy this i think i
62:13 - have this deployed to glitch
62:15 - i just was trying not to uh use it there
62:18 - all right
62:19 - okay let's try this again
62:23 - um let's uh let me go to my glitch
62:27 - account here
62:28 - and just switch over here for a second
62:31 - um to get to
62:34 - a live poll
62:40 - okay so now i'm coming back so i'm gonna
62:46 - um
62:49 - i'm going to uh kill ngrok so ngrok is
62:52 - like my
62:53 - favorite thing which is a way of just
62:56 - like spinning up
62:57 - a open to the public web server from my
62:59 - laptop
63:00 - on whatever port i'm running my node
63:02 - application it's so useful for testing
63:04 - and
63:05 - i just find it to be delightfully
63:07 - wonderful
63:09 - but uh i think yeah everybody's
63:13 - but i uh and i know that things like
63:15 - straw poll exists
63:17 - and all these other services that do
63:20 - exactly this
63:21 - the point is i want my own i
63:24 - work i want to use my own
63:28 - um so let's go to um
63:31 - glitch here and um i
63:34 - am going to um it's not um
63:38 - see if this will wake itself up
63:42 - here's a lot of people who contributed
63:45 - to this
63:48 - uh this is not i haven't boosted this
63:51 - one maybe i should boost this project
63:54 - so that it wakes up um because i do have
63:58 - a pro
63:59 - account um let me check that out here
64:10 - um
64:12 - and i'm going to uh
64:16 - what should i unboost i need to unboost
64:19 - something
64:23 - oh i can unboost this and boost this
64:28 - so the live poll is now being boosted
64:34 - and okay great
64:37 - great now the question is
64:44 - uh i'm just checking something here
64:48 - got it
64:53 - oh no wrong website
64:58 - aha okay hold on
65:02 - everyone hold on
65:07 - i'm going to do something quite radical
65:12 - which is
65:16 - a live pull
65:19 - i know you can't see what i'm doing this
65:22 - makes for
65:23 - really amazing live streaming
65:27 - uh all right so what i'm doing here is i
65:30 - am grabbing this particular github repo
65:33 - which is the full project i am going
65:37 - over to and i just need to make sure
65:39 - the environment yeah does not show up
65:41 - great
65:42 - i'm going to go over to the
65:46 - glitch project which is here i'm going
65:49 - to
65:49 - tools import the import from github
65:53 - going to paste this in so i'm now just
65:55 - like wiping this
65:57 - and bringing in the full project
66:05 - uh and
66:08 - uh i'm going to uh
66:11 - fix something really quick it's gonna go
66:14 - to the readme
66:15 - i'm gonna go back to my camera i'm going
66:17 - to put a little password-y thingy in it
66:20 - which is going to be highly secure
66:28 - and now i'm going to go back to here
66:33 - everything's going to work everything's
66:35 - going to be great
66:37 - now we're going to show
66:41 - in a new window
66:45 - all right so now
66:49 - we everyone should be able to go to live
66:52 - dash
66:52 - poll dash coding dash train
66:56 - dot glitch dot me um you won't
66:59 - see anything there yet
67:07 - on this shirt by the way is
67:08 - foreshadowing a future live stream that
67:10 - i need to do this month
67:12 - because i'm work i have a special
67:14 - project which is all about
67:15 - artificial intelligence and pineapples
67:18 - so i got to come back um why is this not
67:22 - waking up no
67:40 - no
67:54 - um
68:00 - working says philippe
68:03 - all right let's look at tools
68:06 - logs okay it was installing everything
68:09 - the server is running
68:11 - okay great
68:18 - so i should be able to um
68:22 - there we go now here we go
68:25 - we're really really gonna get this to go
68:28 - right now now um enter
68:32 - question here may
68:35 - 7th 2021 question mark
68:40 - yeah so you the the sign in is only
68:43 - required for
68:44 - creating the poll so uh i am going to be
68:48 - able to create the poll by signing
68:49 - in you will be able to vote once i've
68:51 - created the poll without
68:53 - signing in so
68:56 - and um i will uh
69:02 - quickly do something here
69:08 - um i am now updating the password
69:12 - because it was a default password
69:14 - that is probably very easy for all of
69:16 - you to guess
69:22 - um can i
69:26 - restart everything that's fine um
69:29 - okay so create a poll
69:36 - uh may 7th 2021
69:40 - end body uh i forgot already uh well
69:44 - fractal flame this is just a test of the
69:47 - pole it's not the real pole
69:51 - what did i have in that pole uh connect
69:54 - image to ascii
69:57 - image to ascii
70:00 - uh auto encoder no no no no 2d
70:03 - platformer no no p5 glitch i love to
70:05 - look at p5 glitch actually right now
70:08 - uh p5 glitch what is a generator
70:12 - function
70:12 - in js okay create this poll
70:18 - all right so now this should be
70:24 - the link for voting
70:28 - okay so i am going to pick fractal flame
70:33 - that's my one vote now what i need to do
70:37 - and i think if if if nobody didn't like
70:41 - can i just go to like latest no what was
70:42 - the route there's a route that's like
70:45 - um
70:48 - i think it's in the readme actually um
70:52 - create newest newest
70:57 - so i'm gonna go to newest
71:01 - that didn't work oh just like this
71:05 - great awesome okay oh i forgot to add
71:08 - tetris sorry everybody
71:11 - this is not the real poll this is a test
71:13 - of a poll now i'm going to go
71:15 - to here and this should always be
71:20 - uh this particular link
71:23 - i'm gonna have to redo the design
71:25 - because the whole point was it for it to
71:26 - be kind of
71:27 - transparent paste and now if i say
71:30 - newest
71:38 - i knew i was hacked i knew i was hacked
71:41 - oh you were all so mean to me why do you
71:44 - have to be so mean i
71:45 - changed the password
71:49 - does it still not work
71:54 - redirects back to once one person votes
71:58 - this is going so well
72:02 - ladies and gentlemen and everyone else
72:05 - please
72:06 - test your software before you deploy it
72:08 - live on a stream i don't think anybody's
72:10 - watching this anymore
72:13 - [Laughter]
72:14 - at least i was hacked and i do need to
72:16 - eat lunch after this
72:18 - so this is a good sign all right i'm
72:20 - gonna um
72:22 - uh let's go here
72:26 - pizza i have a question wait
72:29 - where's my pole
72:36 - hold on i'm i'm doing something here
72:40 - people
72:42 - create a poll um
72:46 - hold on everyone uh
72:49 - may 7th tetris
72:53 - n body fractal
72:56 - flame pizza generator function
73:02 - all right pull voting link try
73:08 - going to and i'm going to put this in
73:10 - discord
73:12 - try going here i put a link in discord
73:19 - uh and now let's see can i refresh this
73:21 - page
73:22 - how do i refresh the page if i just go
73:25 - back and forth
73:29 - how do i force obs to refresh
73:45 - newest
73:54 - i'm gonna cry same poll redirecting it's
73:57 - the same as before
74:00 - but i'm not even getting uh the pull to
74:03 - come up
74:11 - i boosted this app it should be fast you
74:13 - should be responding fast i could just
74:14 - get rid of that thing in the code
74:15 - and let everybody vote as many times as
74:17 - possible let's do that
74:19 - uh so here we are let's go to um
74:25 - uh where is it uh server web.js
74:29 - let us change and not
74:33 - um so this is in the vote
74:36 - let's not redirect
74:39 - so i'm taking that out so that redirect
74:42 - is now gone
74:43 - which will allow everybody to vote as
74:45 - many times as you want which i'm sure
74:47 - what could possibly go wrong there okay
74:50 - so i'm now gonna go to go
74:51 - to vote
74:59 - um
75:04 - this is going remarkably well whoa
75:07 - oh my god help stop
75:10 - please everybody why delete
75:15 - why why did you i can't i
75:18 - what did not oh
75:21 - everybody found packed my thing
75:25 - okay i've got an idea you're all
75:29 - i'm gonna pull this car over right now
75:32 - and we're not getting pizza
75:35 - no pizza all right it's time for me to
75:37 - take a break this was a big failure
75:40 - i will get a five-minute break
75:44 - you all did this to yourself or one of
75:47 - you did it to everybody else
75:49 - um yeah each time you go to newest
75:50 - there's a new poll because guess what
75:52 - so i could it's fine only i was supposed
75:55 - to be able to
75:56 - i did change my password for whatever
75:58 - reason it's like the
75:59 - like local storage um
76:03 - and it is nice that it's very wholesome
76:04 - what everybody is uh
76:06 - uh posting there as the polls but um
76:10 - this this is i'm sorry everyone we will
76:13 - we will we will
76:14 - we will just go and use straw poll or
76:15 - something else or during the break
76:17 - i will i'm gonna reset the app with a
76:20 - new password
76:21 - and start again but while you're all
76:24 - here
76:25 - it's time for me thank goodness for
76:28 - having friends in the world
76:30 - who want to support the coding train
76:31 - because it allows me
76:33 - to take a moment away from the failure
76:36 - that is
76:37 - this live poll project and talk to you
76:39 - about
76:40 - something called um brilliant
76:44 - so i um i said before at the
76:48 - top of this stream that um you're here
76:50 - because presumably
76:52 - uh you're interested in learning
76:56 - very little learning has been going on
76:57 - would you like some actual learning
76:59 - maybe you want to learn something new in
77:01 - stem maybe computer science
77:03 - math and logic maybe you just want to
77:06 - learn about how the world
77:08 - works what is it that you
77:11 - should do well you could watch
77:14 - educational live streams
77:16 - on youtube but you can see very little
77:18 - learning going on
77:19 - so i i i'm i'm kind of using the this
77:22 - the sort of prepared remarks about
77:23 - brilliant but what i really want to say
77:25 - is that like actually for me
77:27 - the best way uh the way that i discover
77:30 - new algorithms and new concepts and
77:33 - learn
77:33 - uh concepts that i've maybe heard about
77:35 - but didn't have a chance to explore
77:36 - um is by uh is through interactivity um
77:40 - and so brilliant is a website and app
77:42 - that's built off this very this very
77:43 - principle about learning while doing
77:45 - solving in real time um you can see here
77:49 - that that you know if you want if you're
77:51 - interested in coding this is brilliant's
77:53 - course
77:53 - about learning to code with python um
77:57 - this is actually um one of one of my
78:00 - favorite courses that they have
78:02 - about geometry fundamentals so you can
78:04 - see here through
78:05 - explanations through interactive
78:07 - diagrams you can learn
78:09 - about um the pythagorean theorem so and
78:12 - it really like brilliant has something
78:14 - for everybody so basics of math
78:16 - science computer science there's even
78:18 - topics on cryptocurrency and neural
78:20 - networks
78:21 - um so if you would like to join me and a
78:23 - community of 8 million learners and
78:25 - educators
78:26 - today just go and you can sign up for
78:29 - free
78:29 - at brilliant.org codingtrain
78:32 - um and if you would like to unlock the
78:34 - premium subscription you will get 20
78:36 - off or at least the first 200 people to
78:38 - do so by um
78:40 - using that link so um well i actually
78:43 - want to go and take a look at that
78:44 - geometry fundamentals course
78:45 - because it's one of the ones that they
78:47 - sent me um to
78:50 - to take a look at so let me pull away
78:52 - the banner
78:53 - let me not go to my uh and let me go to
78:56 - brilliant.org
78:59 - i'm going to go here to courses
79:02 - and oh beautiful geometry well that
79:04 - sound these are courses that i've worked
79:05 - on recently
79:06 - so you can see what i'm taking this is
79:07 - one that i would really recommend
79:09 - this infinity course if i'm gonna look
79:11 - at fractal flames
79:12 - um lots of related stuff between but i
79:14 - wanted to look for the geometry
79:16 - fundamentals one
79:17 - um if anyone sees it you can see there's
79:19 - just so many courses
79:21 - let's look for geometry fundamentals
79:25 - so let's take a look and let's this is
79:26 - not a course that i've started yet
79:28 - so i'm going to just start it right now
79:31 - and see what up see what happens
79:32 - okay geometry is a way of thinking
79:36 - by looking at the world in shapes and
79:38 - angles we can combine reason with our
79:40 - knack for spotting by the way
79:42 - you can use brilliant on your own you
79:44 - don't need to listen to a person like me
79:45 - just read it to you
79:47 - but um so unfolding sliding rearranging
79:50 - and cutting let's get started look at
79:51 - this beautiful so
79:53 - just at a minimum like i always i love
79:55 - the brilliant uh courses because
79:56 - i see these amazing animations and i
79:58 - think how would i program those in p5
80:00 - so let's at least do the first one okay
80:03 - it's tempting to search for a relevant
80:04 - formula and calculate until an answer
80:06 - emerges
80:07 - but this course will be looking for ways
80:09 - to jump directly so we're kind of using
80:11 - our intuition
80:12 - so just using my intuition in the shape
80:14 - below i mean it doesn't say that but is
80:15 - there more yellow or more white
80:17 - so i'm gonna kind of assume that it's
80:18 - the same
80:20 - just by like the way the the question
80:22 - was phrased
80:23 - but um let's let's try to like puzzle
80:25 - this out
80:26 - so i can see very clearly that there's
80:28 - four
80:30 - squares of yellow and i can see that
80:33 - there's
80:33 - one square here of white but this
80:36 - and this makes up a second one
80:40 - so two this plus this was uh i think
80:43 - they're only
80:44 - like one two three ah there's four
80:46 - squares of white
80:47 - because there's these if i if i kind of
80:49 - zoom in so i can like point to it
80:53 - um so one
80:58 - uh two
81:02 - three four oh i need a bigger
81:06 - field of view for my camera um
81:09 - so let's just say they're equal hit
81:12 - submit and i'm correct
81:14 - um and if we look here oh um and by the
81:16 - way it's
81:17 - ah it's gonna look at this beautiful so
81:19 - i just wanna make nice like animations
81:21 - like this with p5
81:22 - so um and um
81:26 - this is actually really cool because one
81:28 - of the things for me
81:29 - that is a big uh that's part of my life
81:32 - is um working with my kids who are in
81:34 - fourth and sixth grade
81:36 - um on their math homework i'm like the
81:38 - go-to
81:39 - help with your math homework dad um and
81:42 - um actually like i'm seeing so many
81:46 - uh relationships between these
81:48 - fundamentals courses on brilliant and
81:50 - the kind of stuff they're doing in their
81:51 - math homework so
81:52 - this is actually a lot of fun um for me
81:54 - to do with them um as well
81:56 - so um i hope you will consider um
82:00 - brilliant i'm trying to just check here
82:02 - if there's anything else i wanted to say
82:04 - about it um there also is an app that
82:06 - you can use and i'll just remind you
82:08 - that you can go to brilliant.org
82:10 - codingtrain i'm going to take a short
82:12 - few minute break to see if i can figure
82:14 - out what to do about the live poll
82:16 - situation
82:16 - and if you have nothing to do during
82:18 - this time um go ahead and sign up
82:20 - all right uh i will be right back in
82:23 - about
82:24 - five minutes for the roll rest of this
82:27 - live stream i'll be going to about
82:28 - 1pm try to do some actual coding here
82:31 - okay be right back
82:43 - [Music]
82:50 - do
83:04 - so
83:07 - [Music]
83:38 - [Music]
83:46 - do
83:48 - [Music]
84:21 - [Music]
84:31 - [Music]
84:42 - [Music]
84:54 - [Music]
85:35 - [Music]
85:56 - [Music]
86:13 - [Music]
86:39 - [Music]
86:46 - [Music]
87:02 - do
87:05 - [Music]
87:11 - [Music]
87:16 - so
87:30 - [Music]
87:54 - and we're back
87:58 - well i don't know
88:02 - am i doing this live streaming thing
88:03 - right i think i'm definitely not
88:07 - i've got a little bit of time i'm gonna
88:09 - just let's
88:10 - let's june june is gonna be my month
88:13 - right
88:14 - june is busting out all over it will be
88:19 - uh the image to ascii is quite um
88:23 - is really quite taking off here which i
88:25 - love the idea of exploring that right
88:27 - now
88:29 - so that's looking good i can give this
88:32 - maybe
88:34 - a little bit longer here to see what
88:40 - happens
88:50 - it's interesting as i was kind of
88:51 - imagining this would like live sort
88:54 - based on um
88:57 - uh what has the most votes but it does
88:59 - not appear to be doing that
89:08 - i like this exploring image to ascii
89:11 - kind of
89:15 - and i'm glad one person got my carousel
89:19 - [Music]
89:22 - reference
89:25 - all right we're at 100 votes image to
89:29 - ascii
89:30 - with the 40 close to 40 percent
89:34 - um it sorts on refresh
89:38 - all right there we go
89:42 - nice little refresh there uh
89:45 - image to ascii oh things are changing
89:48 - what is an
89:49 - auto encoder great question so an
89:52 - auto encoder is a
89:57 - particular kind of neural network
89:59 - architecture
90:01 - that receives an input
90:04 - and attempts to produce an output that
90:07 - matches the input now
90:09 - wouldn't that be that would be the
90:10 - easiest thing in the world to do
90:13 - if you maintained all of the information
90:16 - throughout the neural network but the an
90:18 - autoencoder takes the inputs
90:20 - and passes them through layers that have
90:23 - fewer
90:25 - units fewer nodes than the amount of
90:27 - inputs there were
90:28 - so in a way it's very similar to a kind
90:30 - of compression algorithm
90:31 - it's taking information compressing it
90:34 - into smaller sets of numbers
90:36 - and then decompressing it back out and
90:38 - it is kind of the foundational
90:41 - um it's a foundational i
90:44 - in my view example for how different
90:47 - kinds of
90:48 - generative deep learning based systems
90:51 - work so if you want to look at a
90:52 - generative adversarial network
90:54 - gan or other kinds of neural network
90:58 - architectures that are used for
90:59 - synthetic media i feel like an auto
91:01 - encoder is a great place to start
91:04 - and look how many people are voting for
91:05 - it now all right i think this
91:07 - is um i think this is pretty good i
91:10 - think we've i think we've seen
91:12 - uh enough here and um all right so
91:16 - here's what i hope
91:17 - um here's what i hope i'm gonna put this
91:21 - away
91:22 - here's what i hope will come out of this
91:25 - um i'm going to work on
91:28 - some ideas for how i might explore
91:33 - making um um ascii art essentially out
91:36 - of an
91:37 - image i've got about a half an hour
91:40 - right now to explore that um
91:44 - what i hope then is that this will be
91:47 - the beginnings
91:49 - of what i would take to a um
91:52 - an edited produced video that would kind
91:55 - of walk through
91:57 - building a image to ascii art generator
92:00 - so this is just
92:01 - a small exploration to um
92:04 - explore say the word explored so many
92:07 - times
92:08 - where i'm going with this all right
92:11 - i think it makes sense to do this in p5
92:16 - oh i'm exhausted this live stream
92:19 - streaming stuff is exhausting okay
92:24 - i gotta i gotta i need to rethink my
92:27 - life here
92:28 - what am i doing i gotta make this
92:30 - something about this isn't is
92:31 - i'm off my game got a june june
92:35 - june is going to be coming up soon all
92:37 - right
92:38 - so how are we into this first let's get
92:39 - an image
92:42 - something high contrast something cute
92:47 - let's start with a kitten
92:51 - um let us go to um
92:55 - an image that is in creative commons
92:57 - license
92:59 - this looks like it will be good
93:02 - let's uh grab this image
93:08 - um let's say let's put this on the
93:11 - desktop as
93:12 - a kitten
93:16 - let us now
93:20 - upload okay save
93:24 - uh upload this file
93:32 - whoa look at this
93:36 - no i'm limited to twitter i've uploaded
93:38 - all i can upload
93:42 - all right well let me just move over to
93:44 - here for a second
93:45 - and uh also get rid of this uh let me
93:50 - just check out
93:51 - i'm sure i can remove uh from my account
93:54 - very easily i'm going to my assets here
93:57 - i just i'm
93:58 - afraid of what might pop up not that i
94:00 - use the
94:01 - p5 web editor for any nefarious business
94:05 - but there must be like some particularly
94:07 - large files
94:09 - can i sort by size no
94:12 - okay um but i'm gonna start deleting
94:14 - some files here
94:18 - oh weird what's
94:21 - that thumbnail pixel
94:24 - yeah this i can get rid of this is
94:27 - always a good idea to just randomly
94:29 - start deleting files
94:31 - to do this more methodically later
94:34 - this i don't need
94:39 - i'm looking for files that are in
94:44 - megabytes
94:48 - um
94:54 - zoom annotations copy all right did i
94:57 - i'm still at 101 percent
95:01 - i could just use a different account
95:02 - what is this
95:05 - uh let's delete this file
95:09 - am i under hit refresh
95:14 - i'm at 98 everybody
95:18 - look look what i have done i got myself
95:21 - down to 98
95:24 - so i could upload the kitten again uh
95:27 - let's see okay this is going so well
95:31 - okay uh okay now
95:35 - let's upload the kitten
95:38 - upload upload upload file
95:45 - uh where is that uh downloads maybe
95:49 - is this the kitten no desktop kitten
95:52 - okay
95:55 - great i'm now
95:58 - going to
96:03 - add preload
96:16 - i would like to see the size of this
96:22 - image
96:28 - um
96:31 - 284 177.
96:35 - it's an interesting uh
96:38 - size for an image
96:47 - okay
96:50 - things are looking up i finally have a
96:53 - kitten
96:54 - i have some code how will i turn this
96:57 - into ascii art
97:00 - so one thing that i could do
97:04 - is i could sort of
97:07 - have i mean there's different ways of
97:10 - doing this and
97:11 - a simple approach which isn't a great
97:13 - one is that
97:14 - um i could just sort of think about the
97:17 - relative
97:18 - brightness of every pixel
97:21 - and i could draw a corresponding
97:24 - character
97:26 - that um that corresponds
97:29 - corresponds to the bright that that ha
97:31 - that that has a kind of brightness to it
97:33 - so
97:34 - in other words um
97:37 - let's think about this um
97:41 - like what if i can what if i have
97:44 - uh what if i loop through every
97:47 - character
97:48 - and evaluate its brightness
97:51 - i mean just just as a just as a quick
97:54 - demonstration of what i mean
97:56 - let's get at least something going here
97:59 - where
98:00 - um i am going to let me let me
98:04 - make a um canvas
98:08 - that is four times as big
98:14 - let me put a background on it
98:17 - uh i would like to
98:20 - and actually this image i would like to
98:23 - down sample it i don't
98:24 - have to do a lot of
98:28 - um manual math in the code right now
98:32 - so let me down sample this to 100 by 62.
98:39 - and i'm going to just call this
98:42 - kitten100 and
98:44 - upload this one
98:48 - maybe something like this already exists
98:50 - a table of like
98:52 - uh ascii characters to corresponding
98:56 - brightness values
98:57 - but i will show you what i mean
99:00 - and then i want to do um
99:06 - let's just do times 10
99:09 - i really should do it down you know what
99:10 - am i doing here
99:12 - let's down sample it even more
99:17 - let's go to like um
99:21 - 48 oh i'm doing percent
99:25 - no i want pixels oh of course it's 48
99:28 - because okay let's go to 48
99:33 - call this kitten 48.
99:39 - and let's upload this one
99:45 - upload this file
99:52 - and uh let's say
99:55 - 48 and i'm going to have a variable i'm
99:58 - going to call it
99:59 - uh the scale i don't want to use the
100:01 - word scale because that's a p5 function
100:04 - um i could say like dim for dimensions
100:07 - let's say 10 so i'm going to
100:12 - create a canvas that is
100:15 - kitten width times
100:19 - some dimension kit and height times that
100:21 - dimension
100:22 - which is 10. uh and now
100:26 - i think i can move this over here
100:29 - this over here and there we go all right
100:31 - so this
100:32 - this is kind of making sense now what i
100:36 - would like to do then is say
100:37 - four let i equal zero i is less than
100:40 - kitten dot and
100:41 - let me just get these into some
100:45 - variables um because
100:58 - i don't have to type kitten.with over
101:00 - and over again
101:02 - with and height
101:07 - um let's do a nice little nested loop
101:15 - and just let's draw a rectangle i'm
101:18 - going to say
101:18 - no fill and this should be
101:21 - j
101:26 - and x is i times the
101:31 - the dimension but whoops y
101:34 - is j times the dimension
101:37 - then i'm going to draw a rectangle at x
101:39 - y of that
101:41 - size uh stroke
101:44 - zero so now i should at least see a grid
101:48 - that matches that image
101:51 - and i need another okay so i've got a
101:55 - grid that matches that image and this i
101:57 - also think is too small so i want to do
102:01 - a just sort of double the size there we
102:04 - go
102:06 - i don't have a tremendous amount of room
102:07 - for both the code and the visual
102:10 - but that's okay this will do
102:13 - so now let's just make sure i can kind
102:17 - of
102:17 - access the brightness of every pixel
102:20 - that's a way that i could start
102:22 - so i would like to say
102:26 - um let's say a kitten
102:31 - load pixels
102:34 - and honestly i'm let's i'm going to make
102:36 - this sort of static right now
102:38 - i don't need to have an animation so i'm
102:40 - going to put this all just in setup
102:43 - make sure this still works and then the
102:45 - pixel
102:46 - index is i plus
102:49 - j times the width times 4
102:52 - this is for um
102:58 - i wonder actually if it would make sense
102:59 - to just use the p5 get function
103:02 - [Music]
103:03 - but i'm going to do this in the manual
103:05 - way i'm going to get the red
103:06 - value is then kitten dot pixels
103:10 - index
103:13 - i'm gonna need the green value and the
103:16 - blue value
103:17 - so this is index plus zero the next one
103:20 - is green
103:21 - the next one is blue you might be
103:22 - wondering like what are you even
103:24 - doing well what i'm doing here
103:27 - is has to do with loading the image and
103:30 - looking at every pixel individually and
103:32 - unpacking each pixel's color
103:34 - all of those colors are in a giant array
103:37 - that goes
103:38 - rgb alpha rgb alpha rgb alpha the alpha
103:41 - doesn't matter to me right now there's
103:42 - no transparency
103:44 - but and in theory if i do this
103:48 - we should see there's a low resolution
103:51 - blown up version of that kitten
103:54 - pretty pretty pretty good now what i
103:58 - would like to
103:59 - look at is the brightness so the
104:02 - um the brightness is r plus
104:05 - g plus b divided by three
104:10 - and i'm going to say if the brightness
104:12 - is greater than some threshold
104:15 - and maybe we'll make that threshold
104:17 - right now
104:20 - i'm going to just say 127 to sort of be
104:22 - halfway
104:24 - fill 0
104:28 - or maybe like to make it brighter
104:31 - otherwise
104:32 - fill uh zero let's see if we can find a
104:35 - reasonable
104:36 - you know i could i could attach this to
104:38 - a slider now
104:40 - oh i want it to be maybe a higher
104:41 - threshold but but this is how i like to
104:43 - work
104:44 - there we go can you kind of see can you
104:46 - see that kitten there
104:47 - there's that kitten oh it's so cute so
104:50 - now i want to try something
104:54 - let's say text font courier
104:57 - i want to use a fixed width font
105:01 - and i'm going to say text
105:05 - zero
105:09 - x y and let me
105:12 - and then otherwise no tech no no text
105:16 - so what will this do here
105:20 - getting somewhere getting somewhere
105:23 - making some ascii art here
105:26 - okay i'm seeing some suggestions in the
105:28 - chat for each pixel write three
105:30 - different ascii characters depending on
105:31 - rgb values
105:33 - but using a blend mode oh i like that
105:35 - idea
105:36 - um so let's try
105:39 - uh text size uh dimension
105:45 - so there's my ascii art
105:48 - kitten um fete is saying this is a very
105:52 - basic list of
105:53 - cars i use but obviously the font
105:55 - matters from lowest
105:56 - to highest out lower to highest alpha
106:00 - all right
106:01 - let's try this
106:04 - oh and yes jupa is saying shouldn't rgb
106:07 - be weighted for a brightness calculation
106:09 - yes so that's definitely an improvement
106:11 - i could make darth k does kind of look
106:13 - like darth kitten
106:14 - so hold on i need these characters i'm
106:16 - taking these characters
106:17 - and i'm putting them into the discord uh
106:23 - oh whoops a wrong keyboard
106:26 - um let's try this
106:30 - um
106:34 - let's try this suggestion
106:39 - from um from feta i believe
106:44 - and i put that into discord here let me
106:47 - try getting these characters
106:49 - from lightness to dark i think
106:54 - um and so now if i go into the code
106:59 - and i think one thing i should do is
107:01 - crop the kitten
107:03 - so just to like give myself some more
107:05 - space here
107:06 - so let me um pull up this kitten 48
107:14 - and let's see if i can crop it around
107:19 - oh the width was it's the height is 30.
107:22 - so let's do 36 by 30.
107:25 - oops
107:30 - so let's call this kitten
107:34 - 36.
107:37 - and i i you know the probably the
107:39 - potential to do this at slightly higher
107:41 - resolution is there
107:45 - so this should help me fit everything
107:47 - there we go
107:49 - now i've got a lot more room see that
107:51 - kitten there
107:53 - so let me go back and get uh these
108:02 - characters
108:06 - so this is interesting this is from i
108:08 - forgot that chat message
108:10 - i assumed right i should do background
108:13 - black and the text white
108:14 - that i could definitely do this looks to
108:16 - me like it is characters that go from
108:20 - uh that i can try using from
108:25 - brightest to darkest or darkest to
108:27 - brightest if they're white
108:29 - i wanted to do this with dom elements
108:30 - ultimately because i think it'll be much
108:32 - more interesting to select it but let's
108:33 - that'll be a separate step um
108:36 - let's try this suggestion of having the
108:39 - background
108:40 - be zero and i'm gonna put on the auto
108:42 - refresh throw caution to the wind here
108:44 - um and then change this
108:48 - to um here to be
108:52 - fill 255.
108:55 - there we go now what i would like to do
108:58 - is
109:01 - i want to get an index so the
109:04 - brightness index is
109:08 - map brightness which goes from 0 to 255
109:11 - to go from 0 to
109:14 - what is this called cars.length i'm
109:17 - going to call this text
109:21 - and then call this text
109:25 - and then so what i'm doing is i'm just
109:27 - trying to like whatever the brightness
109:28 - might be
109:29 - go and pull a character from that array
109:31 - um and i need to floor
109:33 - this but i'll say the the character the
109:36 - car
109:37 - the ch is uh text
109:41 - index oh dot car at floor the
109:44 - brightness index and then now
109:50 - i don't need to worry about the
109:54 - threshold
109:56 - uh do we see the kitten there
109:59 - now i do kind of like the idea of
110:04 - keeping the so this is pretty
110:05 - interesting here i sort of feel like
110:08 - i probably should have a um
110:14 - wow so this image is kind of an
110:15 - interesting one to pick
110:17 - where i'm not getting any uh like i
110:19 - definitely want to like put in a space
110:24 - but like i can do a lot of this is sort
110:28 - of like
110:29 - sort of like a way of thresholding it
110:32 - just by adding more spaces
110:34 - so that's kind of interesting um
110:38 - so this is pretty good actually
110:42 - it looks more like an owl i agree let's
110:45 - take out one more
110:46 - now you know i think there's i think we
110:49 - this this list of characters is somewhat
110:51 - uh questionable
110:54 - um oh yeah and maybe these weren't meant
110:56 - to be here yeah
110:58 - yeah i don't think those are really
110:59 - meant to be there
111:02 - [Music]
111:04 - um
111:06 - is it interesting to have so i think
111:08 - this makes the image harder to read i
111:11 - mean
111:11 - obviously a lot has to do with this
111:12 - particular image
111:14 - but i like this as a kind of arbitrary
111:17 - way of thresholding it
111:19 - yeah all right that's pretty good that's
111:21 - pretty good
111:23 - okay now i would like this to actually
111:26 - be a
111:26 - dom elements so that i could um
111:30 - select this and copy paste it somewhere
111:33 - so let's see how i could do that
111:36 - um so the first thing that i want to do
111:38 - is go into the css
111:41 - and um let's just uh
111:45 - let's enforce a background color
111:50 - actually let's
111:54 - let's keep it i'm going to do it i'm
111:56 - going to invert it for the css
111:58 - because i feel like most text
112:01 - environments
112:02 - that's not necessarily true at terminal
112:04 - all right let's
112:05 - let's keep it so now
112:08 - what i need to do is create a div
112:14 - and ultimately
112:18 - let's change this to i kind of
112:21 - i think it might be helpful for me to
112:22 - see both for a moment
112:24 - so let's do let me see if i can create a
112:27 - div
112:28 - above the canvas
112:32 - i don't think no it's always going to be
112:35 - um so i need that how do you do how do
112:36 - you set a font color in css
112:40 - is it this or is it text color
112:45 - no text color i don't know css
112:49 - color ah there we go
112:53 - uh font size oh font family
113:00 - okay a font size
113:09 - okay let's try that for right now
113:12 - okay and let's just keep it at 16.
113:16 - so now what i would like to do is
113:23 - um let's make uh
113:27 - let's call it ascii div i don't need all
113:29 - these global variables because i'm
113:32 - not using an animation loop so this is
113:34 - kind of
113:35 - silly so let's do
113:38 - this
113:44 - um i just i think it makes sense to just
113:48 - have this all be one function
113:51 - because ultimately
113:55 - so i'm just kind of cleaning this up
113:57 - here
114:04 - okay so now
114:10 - i have this ascii div and so
114:13 - what i would like to do is create
114:16 - a big string i think this makes
114:19 - sense i mean i probably should use like
114:21 - the pre tag or something
114:23 - using a monospace func okay um okay
114:26 - so let's make a
114:29 - um let's make a string
114:33 - i'll call it output is an empty string
114:36 - and here output plus equals
114:41 - that character
114:44 - but after every oh i'm going down
114:48 - this has to be the inside loop
114:52 - still the same output plus every
114:54 - character and then in the outer loop
114:57 - output plus equals a line break
115:01 - although a line break won't actually
115:03 - show up
115:05 - and then i want to say
115:08 - ascii div dot html
115:13 - that output
115:17 - whoops oh
115:21 - okay so this is all of the
115:24 - characters but i need to use a
115:26 - non-breaking
115:27 - space and then i think this has to be
115:31 - like this right if it's going to end up
115:33 - showing up on an html page
115:35 - okay that makes sense and then i should
115:38 - be saying
115:40 - um if
115:44 - character is a space
115:54 - um then is it this like
115:57 - non-breaking space like that
116:00 - ah oh look at that
116:07 - oh and it made it skinnier okay so now i
116:09 - can do no canvas
116:13 - because i don't i kind of don't want the
116:14 - canvas i can comment it out
116:21 - um and so
116:29 - so this is all just canvas stuff
116:32 - so is a threshold is no longer relevant
116:36 - and so is that so if i i'm just
116:38 - commenting the canvas stuff out in case
116:40 - we want to put it back in
116:46 - and i think it would make more sense
116:50 - for this to be an array but then i could
116:53 - have the non-breaking space in it
116:55 - okay css line height to make it a square
116:58 - how do i do that
117:01 - um how do i make a css
117:05 - line height okay i don't know the
117:08 - line height line height
117:17 - that's better right i don't know what
117:20 - the
117:23 - i don't know what it's supposed to be
117:25 - but let's try 14.
117:27 - does that look like a kitten to you
117:30 - and in theory like i could copy paste
117:34 - this
117:35 - and then go to discord
117:43 - and paste it into discord so this is
117:46 - cool because we could make like a
117:47 - discord bot
117:48 - that you give it an image and it returns
117:51 - you back to ascii art
117:52 - the thing about this though people who
117:54 - make ascii art generally
117:56 - they're like cleverly like contouring
117:59 - the image
118:00 - so like i could do edge detection and
118:02 - put like slashes around it
118:04 - so i think um i think there could be
118:06 - like a different way of doing this
118:08 - that might be a bit more effective
118:11 - but this is kind of good so now now the
118:13 - question is like
118:15 - what like what happens when i start
118:16 - using other images
118:18 - lower resolution images or higher
118:21 - resolution images
118:22 - but i think i would leave that for all
118:24 - of you to sort of like sort out
118:26 - because it's almost one o'clock well so
118:27 - this would so so here's the question for
118:29 - you
118:31 - i used to do stuff like this during my
118:34 - live streams in a more performative
118:37 - way knowing that
118:40 - i was going to then edit that out and
118:42 - make it into a standalone video the
118:44 - coding challenge would be like
118:45 - ascii from image but now the question
118:48 - is oh oh doing making this an oh whoa
118:51 - whoa
118:51 - [Music]
118:52 - hold your horses everybody
118:57 - duplicate i mean what is wrong with me
119:01 - shiffman uh video
119:07 - uh video equals create capture
119:11 - create video capture i can't remember
119:13 - how this works create capture
119:16 - video
119:21 - is that how it works
119:24 - um so yep okay so
119:28 - now video dot size
119:32 - uh 36 by 20 24 probably
119:39 - okay video
119:42 - video
119:46 - well i don't need i think this makes
119:48 - more sense
119:49 - oh but i'm not in draw anymore okay hold
119:51 - on
119:56 - um this is gonna be cool if i can get
120:00 - this to work
120:01 - um
120:07 - [Music]
120:10 - um
120:19 - uh
120:22 - remove child no canvas what
120:28 - what did i miss
120:31 - oh boy this is bad
120:41 - um
120:44 - oh no canvas should not be here
120:50 - there we go
120:54 - that's pretty wild
120:59 - and this is by the way this is a dom
121:01 - element this is not canvas
121:04 - i should be able to select that
121:10 - that is pretty cool
121:16 - um the thresh holding use 80 columns
121:20 - so
121:24 - um
121:27 - does it make sense to just
121:33 - well that's just
121:42 - well this was fun this was a good little
121:44 - mini project
121:49 - that you could take with you today uh
121:51 - here
121:52 - is
121:55 - oh wait i kind of messed this up like
122:02 - what's
122:06 - um like i could do this like a lot more
122:13 - wait
122:17 - let's just make it confused
122:21 - oh the dimensions is sort of not really
122:23 - doing anything right now because
122:27 - the the size of the font um
122:31 - all right i'm gonna i'm gonna just
122:35 - i forget that am i using dimensions
122:37 - anymore
122:42 - no this is no longer relevant i was just
122:46 - using that for when i had a canvas
122:49 - so really
122:52 - like how big could i get this
122:57 - uh too big
123:04 - oh but the video height sorry
123:08 - doesn't make any sense
123:12 - just want to see sort of performance
123:13 - wise ooh what did i do
123:19 - oh no that's it's just too big
123:25 - it can't and it's like wrapping the text
123:27 - okay
123:29 - too big
123:33 - i just wanna like what's a kind of
123:36 - reasonable like if i go now to
123:38 - um share and go to uh full
123:47 - okay i messed up something
123:51 - something is off in my uh math
123:59 - oh this is so okay
124:03 - i am a really annoying person who has
124:06 - made
124:08 - quite an error in judgment in the way
124:10 - that i have named my variables
124:24 - oh i don't need this anymore what is
124:27 - wrong with me
124:28 - okay here we go stop
124:39 - there we go but
124:42 - that also i'm not really getting the
124:45 - ascii effect there
124:47 - that's still to let's go um 80 by 60 i
124:50 - think
124:51 - probably makes more sense i also want to
124:55 - say
124:55 - video dot hide
125:02 - there we go
125:18 - and
125:26 - look at me
125:30 - decrease the number of spaces people are
125:32 - saying yeah maybe that makes sense
125:34 - in this one
125:46 - yeah there we go now i'm getting much
125:48 - more detail
125:52 - look at the pineapples people look at
125:56 - the pineapples
126:01 - and what's cool about this i just want
126:02 - to show you is i'm going to say
126:05 - no loop
126:09 - oh wait why oh okay and i'm going to
126:16 - grab this
126:22 - and i'm going to go to discord
126:27 - my message is over 2000 characters
126:33 - well okay let's just get
126:36 - let's just get part of it
126:43 - still it's over 2000 characters how many
126:46 - characters is this the top of my head
126:50 - there we go
126:53 - there's the top of my head now in
126:55 - discord
126:57 - but you get the idea uh can i put this
126:59 - in like a gist
127:14 - here i am folks
127:18 - look that's a that's a pineapple right
127:20 - there pretty wild
127:27 - right i could use marching squares to
127:29 - add an ascii border with the slashes
127:32 - that's a super fun idea anyway so
127:36 - here's this is my question i'm wrapping
127:38 - up the stream now that it's 106.
127:40 - um and um the question i have is what
127:44 - should i do
127:45 - should i make now uh
127:50 - um should i make
127:53 - a
127:57 - um i could do this as a coding challenge
128:00 - so i could do this i've done it already
128:02 - now but i could kind of like walk
128:03 - through the building of it
128:05 - and kind of maybe there's some ideas of
128:07 - improvements um
128:08 - mallory brothers is asking for the code
128:10 - um
128:11 - oh andreas justin's ascii playground
128:14 - okay
128:15 - great thank you so two things here one
128:17 - is
128:18 - this is the code for um this i'm gonna
128:20 - put this into
128:22 - uh the discord channel so um here
128:25 - if you wanna grab this code oh anna
128:31 - [Music]
128:34 - salko
128:36 - anna salko has joined the passengers
128:40 - of the coding train welcome anna right
128:42 - on time i don't even know if you're
128:43 - watching this right now or
128:45 - that message just happened but you are
128:47 - here make sure
128:49 - you look for the special link to a
128:50 - google form so that you can get your
128:53 - stickers in the mail
128:54 - also you are in need of your very own
128:56 - random number stay tuned
128:58 - the next live stream we will be
129:00 - premiering uh
129:01 - kobe one uh discord manager st plays on
129:04 - discord
129:05 - has um rebuilt um along with the help
129:08 - also i believe from um david
129:10 - um this uh a new features to the choo
129:13 - choo bot to be able to assign random
129:15 - numbers generate random walk path pat
129:17 - patterns and those will be etched onto
129:19 - train whistles
129:20 - the summer of coding train is coming
129:24 - um welcome aboard anna oh you are there
129:26 - anna so um please come and join the
129:28 - discord and we'll get in touch
129:29 - for um in terms of how to get you your
129:31 - member rewards and all that kind of
129:32 - stuff and the discord by the way
129:34 - is open to everyone there are just some
129:35 - member channels
129:37 - for those of you who are able to join
129:38 - and support in that way i super
129:40 - appreciate it
129:42 - now back to what i was doing was so
129:46 - this is the code uh for that this
129:48 - particular sketch
129:50 - now let me go to and let me name this
129:54 - uh ascii video example
129:59 - and then let me also open i believe i
130:02 - had the one that was just the kitten
130:06 - um and this is the uh ascii kitten
130:10 - let's just make sure this is the right
130:12 - one right here's the ascii kin no
130:14 - computational mama
130:18 - first of all computational mama you
130:20 - might have what is possibly
130:22 - the best youtube username on the entire
130:26 - internet
130:27 - thank you for joining the coding train
130:31 - what you get is your very own random
130:34 - number
130:34 - i lost my random number book what do i
130:36 - do without my random number book
130:39 - come and join the discord we will get
130:41 - you your random number
130:43 - um uh assigned to you um and i know
130:47 - it's been some of you especially those
130:50 - of you who are at the
130:52 - um conductor level um ascii fractal
130:55 - flame is a brilliant idea
130:56 - um those of you who are at the conductor
130:58 - level have been waiting
131:00 - possibly uh up to at least two years
131:03 - for your custom train whistle that is
131:06 - next that is the num one of the
131:08 - the number one priorities to get to the
131:10 - bot
131:11 - the discord bot generating the random
131:13 - walk patterns was the first step
131:15 - uh jason hegland uh who makes all the
131:18 - merchandise designs
131:19 - and does all the coding train
131:20 - illustrated characters has been setting
131:23 - up with a
131:24 - laser etcher in uh in the support organ
131:27 - department
131:28 - um and so all of that is coming edge
131:30 - detection and the slashes
131:32 - is a wonderful uh next step so what was
131:34 - it that i was supposed to look at that
131:36 - was stig suggestion um ascii
131:39 - art andreas something like this
131:45 - um um i don't know if this is the right
131:48 - let's look at these two
131:51 - links under creativeapplications.net
131:54 - o is not a letter it's a circle uh
131:57 - is this what i'm looking for whatever
131:59 - this is it's going to be amazing
132:05 - whoa what is this even
132:11 - that's very loud
132:21 - cool
132:25 - uh digital art ascii and i should
132:29 - have jason browser race live coding
132:31 - playground stunning imagers with text
132:33 - okay i think this is what i'm looking
132:34 - for
132:36 - whoa okay
132:41 - interesting density oh look this is
132:45 - another
132:46 - set of characters i could use in reverse
132:49 - order
132:50 - just very very briefly
132:54 - let's go to think of all you could do
132:57 - with just like
132:58 - you can make a whole game now this way
133:01 - let's just try out of curiosity
133:06 - this and now i'm going to change this
133:08 - from
133:09 - txt to and i want to make sure i give
133:13 - credit to this
133:14 - um
133:18 - where is this uh
133:19 - [Music]
133:21 - from there and so now
133:25 - instead of getting it from txt it's from
133:27 - density
133:29 - now this is with it
133:32 - um
133:35 - [Music]
133:39 - density so that's interesting to see now
133:43 - this is inverted
133:45 - um so i could actually say
133:48 - density.length
133:50 - down to zero which would do it the other
133:54 - way around
133:58 - and then my instinct is to add a bunch
134:02 - of spaces
134:05 - but just to kind of like
134:14 - you know kind of doing what i did before
134:17 - just to sort of threshold it so we can
134:18 - see there's
134:19 - you know again the image that you pick
134:21 - how you
134:22 - choose to have this array of brightness
134:24 - characters
134:25 - i um is is pretty um interesting to
134:28 - think about but here's just
134:29 - like another another list of characters
134:33 - um awesome so all right so
134:36 - uh edge detection is exactly what i want
134:39 - to do
134:40 - um thank you everybody for tuning in
134:42 - thank you for the two new members
134:43 - did i paste this example into the into
134:46 - discord i did not
134:48 - so kitten i would
134:51 - love if any of you uh take this and do
134:54 - anything with it
134:54 - share it with me i would like to turn
134:56 - this into an actual um
134:58 - coding challenge video maybe i can refer
135:00 - to some of these other
135:01 - um artworks i do have to go it is 1 15.
135:05 - um there will be at least one more lot
135:07 - well there will be at least two more
135:08 - live streams in may
135:10 - because one will be and i can tell you
135:11 - the date of it
135:13 - the itp um let's look um let's go to
135:18 - itp.nyu.edu
135:19 - show um i will be doing in the evening
135:23 - of may 18th
135:24 - a live stream of the show itself it's
135:27 - all an
135:27 - online show so you shouldn't tune into
135:30 - the live stream you should actually just
135:31 - go
135:31 - and participate in the show itself let
135:34 - me put this link
135:35 - also in uh discord if you want to take a
135:37 - look at it
135:38 - um but there will be a live stream there
135:40 - will also be at least one more of these
135:42 - friday live streams in may
135:44 - um where i will be continuing to sort of
135:46 - get myself organized for the summer
135:49 - of coding challenges differentiate the
135:51 - rgb
135:52 - channel and use color text that is a
135:54 - great idea
135:56 - um sarvagya is asking about the holiday
135:59 - pins
136:00 - so all the holiday pins were sent out
136:02 - there were a couple
136:04 - that got returned because of address
136:06 - issues
136:07 - um and i believe that we've been in
136:09 - touch with you if that was the case
136:10 - but um send a message to the um to the
136:14 - moderation team
136:15 - on discord or write an email to merch
136:18 - at thecodingtrain.com if you were one of
136:20 - the holiday pin folks and there's an
136:22 - issue and you didn't get it so
136:24 - i do want to make sure everybody got
136:25 - their holiday pins a digit clock is a
136:27 - great idea
136:28 - so many possibilities thank you for
136:30 - tuning in um let me just
136:32 - play this goodbye song here while i have
136:34 - five percent of
136:35 - uh ipad battery left
136:39 - um and i will answer any questions that
136:41 - i see in the next uh two and a half
136:43 - minutes
136:44 - while i close out some of these links
136:47 - [Music]
136:58 - um let's see i'm looking to see if
136:59 - there's any questions um
137:02 - please make sure that you um take a look
137:04 - at the computer mouse conference
137:07 - um all the archives of all the talks and
137:09 - you could watch obviously the
137:10 - video the computer mouse video that i
137:13 - made
137:14 - on the coding train channel itself
137:16 - [Music]
137:17 - uh there's a little trolling going on
137:19 - asking me to prove the riemann
137:21 - hypothesis that won't be happening in
137:22 - the next
137:23 - uh what two minutes of this stream
137:28 - um
137:30 - [Music]
137:32 - how do you find the algorithm for any
137:34 - coding challenges
137:36 - challenge says coding with 3dv well
137:39 - not to be a i i am reminded now that i
137:43 - should give a quick thank you to the uh
137:46 - sponsor of today's live stream but
137:48 - brilliant.org
137:50 - codingtrain it's a wonderful interactive
137:52 - a website of lessons in education
137:53 - materials
137:54 - that you can sign up for and find a lot
137:56 - of algorithms to explore
137:59 - but another thing that i would highly
138:00 - recommend is something called the
138:02 - algorithm archive
138:08 - which is a project by um
138:11 - james schloss or there's a youtube
138:13 - channel lee ios leo s
138:15 - um and actually um
138:18 - um yeah there's this is just a wonderful
138:21 - collection of
138:22 - different kinds of algorithms with
138:24 - written texts and explanations this is
138:25 - just
138:26 - an amazing project so oh um
138:29 - and maybe um some of these computational
138:34 - geometry algorithms uh could be quite
138:36 - useful for this
138:37 - ascii art idea as well
138:40 - [Music]
138:43 - does itb have any international student
138:45 - program exchange so
138:46 - you should contact itp.inquiries i
138:50 - believe at nyu.edu i think
138:52 - that the address is on the website um
138:53 - there's lots of programs there's lots of
138:55 - international students
138:56 - there's a summer camp that you can
138:58 - actually join that's all online that's
138:59 - very reasonably priced
139:01 - so um but yeah contact the department
139:03 - directly
139:04 - um for that
139:06 - [Music]
139:08 - would you ever consider making a larger
139:10 - collaborative project
139:12 - yeah i consider all wonderful ideas
139:15 - thank you for that
139:16 - oh this is uh signing off now thank you
139:20 - for tuning in
139:21 - um see you next time on the coding train
139:23 - i really appreciate all of you
139:25 - uh goodbye
139:26 - [Music]
139:28 - as always i always forget that this dot
139:30 - this stock is

140:33 - the this dot
140:46 - i'm going to say once again here we go
140:59 - it's look forward to cartesian
141:07 - [Music]
141:10 - coordination
141:18 - autotune and the internet will fix that
141:20 - for me
141:29 - [Music]
141:40 - [Music]
141:50 - unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what
141:53 - else is there

143:30 - a
143:30 - this is a wonderful thing okay we're
143:33 - gonna do it
143:33 - i'm really getting to something i need

144:39 - bye everybody have a wonderful weekend
144:41 - see you soon

Cleaned transcript:

so do so do do so check hello everyone i will be starting in approximately two minutes and 30 seconds let me turn down the music for when i'm talking that's probably a slightly better balance and i'll be back in a moment do do do hello happy friday and welcome to a live episode of what's the name of this thing again the coding train is it okay if i change the name of the channel at some point in the future i probably won't but i'm just wondering oh remember what i used to call it coding something that i won't say right now i suppose um hello everyone it's so nice to see all of you um saying hello in the chat um hello to everyone around the world who i know watches the coding train i know there are quite a few viewers in india and i hope everyone there is staying safe and healthy um i'm really thinking of everybody around the world who is struggling through so many different kinds of challenges right now whether it be the global pandemic or um otherwise so i hope that this stream uh wherever you are whatever time it is that you're watching can bring you something positive today whether it's uh watching me just struggle through two hours of trying to use a computer or maybe you might learn something or find a little humor or laughter or a friendly face that's what i hope my face is as i try to clean my glasses um but let's get started uh first up i would like to thank today's sponsor of the live stream um that is my friends over at brilliant i like to make video tutorials to teach interesting concepts in math and science and graphics and computers and all sorts of related things but if you would like to also learn those things through interactive lessons through puzzling it out yourself through a community of people also learning you can sign up and do that for free at brilliant.org codingtrain um there are also a whole set of courses that you can unlock it's a premium member of brilliant and if you sign up through that link the first 200 people to do so will receive 20 off so i'll come back a little later in the stream and look more at brilliant website but um i wanted to just uh start off by thanking brilliant now i don't have a plan for today um i am looking at the chat i'm seeing some great suggestions so here's the thing we are entering we being me you and uh whoever else is part of this engine um are entering a new phase in the life of the coding train because for me the summer is a very different time of year than the academic school year because i happen to have this fulltime day job that i really should probably be working on right now um which is teaching at um new york university um there are two programs there our graduate program called itp an undergraduate program called ima most of the sequence tutorials that are on the channel are tutorials that i create for the courses that i teach there and then i also spend some time doing these live streams and other stuff here on the channel but the summer is approaching which means my daytoday commitments lighten up quite a bit now i do like any of you i would expect also would like to enjoy the summer the beautiful weather i see the sun shining outside there's a cool breeze there's the the blooming plants are out i like to spend some time in my little garden here in brooklyn i like to go for a jog every once in a while so i have some children we've got a little league game tonight go rip tides um but um so while there might be some times over the summer i will take a break from this thing that i do here i also would like to just invest really in the coding trade community in making more videos and i think i really think what i need to get back to is the coding challenges it is probably the most watched the most requested the most if anything is beloved in any way shape or form it certainly is uh the most um enjoyed content that i produce so but interestingly enough so i today is a little bit of me trying to press the reset button a little bit i have no plan get organized i have a lot of lingering just projects that are just you know just twisting in the wind i think is really the expression one of which is the live poll software web application that i would like to revisit um and i'm looking at the chat and seeing all of your lovely messages thank you k weekman for um um uh compiling some of the suggestions and bringing them into the member discord um let's see here though but i do want to uh talk about something to one thing here a live bug report on the coding train website um this is not the latest video so the coding train website by the way which is going to have a relaunch that's a whole other topic to talk about which i will not but not for today for the future stay tuned uh i owe some people some emails back if any of you that i owe an email to about the relaunch of the website are watching i know i owe you that email it's after may 1st we were supposed to get started soon um so the website is supposed to um one of the things that i really struggle with is that i um you know i greatly benefit and appreciate youtube as a platform i don't think i'd be able to do what i'm doing right now without youtube or something in that vein there are many issues and criticisms that i have about youtube as a platform google perhaps as a company um you know um i'm still you can see here i'm using the chrome browser i'm i'm not perfect here i have not been able to extricate myself from just everything i use being google products but all that said one of the things that i really struggle with with youtube and just to pull up the channel here for a second is uh it's not a great place to organize a lot of sequence tutorial content so the website's goal is to do that so if you're new here by the way i just want to highlight this this is where you should begin if you want to learn code for the first time if you think that the p5.js javascript library could be the right framework and platform for you the coding trained videos appeal to your sensibility you're not severely irritated by me which you know some percentage of the audience is i i see you in the comments being severely irritated by my gestures and tangents and all that i get it i get it other people like it some people don't it's the way the world works um this is where you would want to start uh but live bug report here i don't know if we can fix this in real time if any of the uh managers of the website yeah uh managers of the website are um watching this should actually um show the most recent video which is uh this machine learning and the computer mouse so one of the things i want to mention about this video and i'm not going to uh play it for you uh let me know in the chat if you have not seen this video already i'm kind of curious how many people tune into the live streams found their way but don't necessarily watch some of the produced content that appears but this video is completely different than anything i ever made before i can just sort of scan through it you can see that it is more produced with some animations and i actually i'm reading from a script and various uh topics it was actually created for a conference called the computer mouse conference so one thing i am curious i wouldn't mind if i can get my live poll thing going to throw up a poll throw up a poll sounds a little bit odd to uh post a friendly poll for you to select your choice um if you appreciate it and like this style would like to see me make more videos like this or should i get back more to my roots which is ultimately kind of what i'm doing right now but just i press the button record i type of the code i make the mistakes and then eventually uh i press stop and then you watch it later at some point anyway i'm kind of curious about that i'm seeing i'm reading the chat here differential growth is a great suggestion hari uh says i haven't seen it yet um uh corey says i've been watching coding challenge but i haven't seen the most recent video um and luis says for me it's the opposite i barely catch a stream yeah that's um certainly i would say more um typical um null pointer says i prefer the organic nature of your videos to that scripted one but i still enjoyed it a lot yeah so i think my kind of um point of view about this at present is i really loved making this it was a tremendous amount of work and expense frankly um but um and so i would like to continue doing things like that but that's more of a once i mean at a maximum that's like a once a month kind of project um and i would like to keep going with the um it's not that i want to do a a quantity over quality but i think that i have a system for making what i hope is high quality low production value light editing uh videos so um yes and kobe is saying that the mouse conference got a separate tab under more and so the home page of the website uh has some code involved where i think it only pulls videos that are from the coding challenges coding cabana so that would be something we would have to fix but it's right here and you can see actually i need to embed the video on this page but all the code but one of the things that i really wanted to show you and let me just switch just to um i'm going to take myself out of the picture here i'm going to open up this um oh now i've lost it um i thought it was this but no this is the actual video but not the final one where did i put this on my mess of a desktop here uh yes this is what i'm looking for no so what i wanted to just quickly i'm just going to quickly play this for you then i might talk through some of it this is a quick um this is a quick behindthescenes um little 30second video that uh matia who does all the editing for the coding train helped put together to show how we created the effect of the desktop kind of living in the garden with me walking behind it and back in front of it although it doesn't actually show that walking behind it thing but you'll get the idea here all right so let me just uh play this for you so i don't know if that was uh selfexplanatory enough but basically what this is is it's not a it's not me standing in front of a green screen i am actually standing outside um in the this garden space and you can see the raw footage of the garden looks like this but this is a particular technology from a company that i refer to quite often i'm an advisor to this company was founded by some alums of the program where i teach called runwayml and runwayml has some ai driven video tools one of which is called a green screen and so what green screen allows you to do and it doesn't have to be just for people most of the demos show people but it allows you to take a particular video click various key points so that's me kind of like click well i'm not actually doing this mateo was doing this clicking key points on the body and you could see the ai then tries to recognize the object now it didn't recognize the music stand but we also want to key out the music stance so one of the things that's wonderful about this tool is you can then click on that item and it's going to uh generate and then it generates a mask and then so we're able to generate a mask much like a green screen and not you know you can you can see there's some rough edges some slight imperfections but for having this in terms of if any of you have ever done any manual rotoscoping the amount of time it would take to do this at this level of quality even uh would be a tremendous amount of time i don't got this marvel uh uh visual effects department budget over here so um once we have that um i record screen recorded a lot of visual imagery um on as a just screen recording the desktop but left the desktop background the sort of perfect green color so that could be keyed out as a layer over the garden video and then after that you can see here like we can then take the masked version of me and layer that over so what's wonderful about this is even though there are some slight imperfections in the key when there's something else behind it like because it's the actual footage the uh there's no imperfection here because this is actually just the real footage it's the garden and me so um i'm seeing a lot of nobody seems to be responding to what i'm talking about in the chat but uh i hopefully you find this somewhat interesting and um you you can check out this tool yourself i'm going to runwayml.com so i wanted to mention that i wanted to encourage you to check out the mouse conference video also uh just to be uh frank here you should uh you really shouldn't watch my video what you should do is go to computermouseconference.net i want to click on this page here so it's complicating the complicatingthecomputermouse.net archived here this is the full um video of the conference with all the talks so i would really just kind of just scan through them oh this is me often just so ridiculous composed of rubber binded too so i really would recommend all of the archive of this conference um the panels were amazing there's this really cool chat system that you can read back over here it's just like it has all this wonderful ascii art in it so um i really um i really would encourage you to check out complicated computer mouse conference i try to really really be selective about participating in conferences because it creates a tremendous amount of stress for me and it takes up a huge amount of time and uh yeah i'd frankly just like to be making videos and teaching my classes so but the computer mouse conference is such a wonderful event i was so honored to be invited i also just want to mention that um nedo bomani an artist created uh did a live stream on the coding train making a zine um and if you missed that i'm just gonna there's no audio here i'll just play this for you really quickly this is i haven't released this anywhere yet but this is just a quick um uh timelapse video of the entire um zine making process it's about a minute and 30 seconds so um neda created basically a page in the scene for every talk of course by coincidence as if as if this was planned um we had a a technology issue during the time when she was making the page for my talk so you won't see that appear but there's a page for every other um um every other um speaker and panelist i believe at the conference um and um i'm going i don't know we'll put this somewhere on social media where you can sort of see this whole process um is really kind of incredible uh definitely something that i aspire to to think about what kinds of creative live streaming can i do um that's not just you know typing code and software um and this was really amazing i want to let this full thing play out for a second we'll just i don't have any music to play so enjoy the silence for a moment i can't let the silence go a lot of the things that neta was printing and cutting out were submissions by people who are watching the live stream um i just the end is my favorite and there you go look at this beautiful that's the look at this beautiful like beautiful beautiful object that was created over seven or eight hours during the course of the conference that's just all in a minute and a half okay um so um what's happening now i've got to get to something here let's i've seen so many wonderful suggestions in the chat before um i start to look at the um putting up a poll and trying to start maybe programming one of those suggestions i want to do two things i want to revisit my rainbow topics repository um there's wonderful suggestions of different things to look at here and what i would actually like to do is go here i believe at the what i've been doing is at the beginning of every kind of academic term like i'm sort of dividing the year up into fall 2020 spring 2021 now we're out to summer 2021. i would like to look at this markdown file and i'm just going to click edit i'm going to grab all of the text for it i'll leave that intact and i'm going to now make a new file whoops we're going to call it oops nope call it summer 2021 dot mark down and i'm just going to paste in what i had there before so let's start to look and eliminate things that i've already done now i have to one thing that's kind of unfortunate and i this is all on me is there's a huge backlog of things that i've done that i haven't actually published as videos so good news for all of you i suppose um if i if it once i get my act together and hopefully that's gonna happen this month especially now that the semester is winding down and that conference is over there's five uh videos for nature of code three videos for intro to programming with p5 and one coding challenge all of which yet to be released on the channel so if i math there's close to 10 videos that have yet to be released um and um i'm getting a great suggestion and body simulation that's really not something i've done before but let's let me look through this and i'm the summer is not the time for me to focus on the sequenced tutorials that's really the academic year stuff for me although it would be nice to make some progress to have them ready but i believe i did and anyone on the uh uh any i don't i believe i did and maybe some of the members who have tuned in for some of my recording sessions ah blender 3d that's also oh i gotta like uh i really want to learn blender my son is like a whiz at photoshop and video editing i discovered like i was trying to do and like i feel like he would really take to blender um and so um don't worry matthew you're not gonna be out of work yet he's pretty good at video editing but i think we can still need you um um but i i i did 2.1 to 2.5 so i'm gonna take that out i did uh all of chapter three i can take that out um chapter four i have done chapter five i have done but there could be more um the these i do need to do machine learning this is very important to me this is very important i guess i haven't done this as a video uh never got around to these express stop videos that's another i recorded a pilot of this idea of like a short uh one one to two minute video explaining a concept i suppose i should just be on tick tock now doing that so these all oh and i did um template literals is what i did um i guess uh i guess i could do this kind of just to indicate that discord bot i never finished those so those that should still be there uh coding challenges um yeah so this is what should go at the top here i did update this this library but i never did it in a video but i'm gonna that's gonna uh just go away uh i really wanna start working with uh vinyl cutting and a plotter uh learn a blender i did see a comment um from something about learn learning unity you know i'm it's a little silly for me to say this given a lot of the commercial tools that i do use uh on a daily basis and also in my videos but i prefer if at all possible to use um open source free uh tools and unity i suppose is kind of on the borderline there it's not open source i don't know what extent it's free but blender feels to me like in the spirit of p5 and processing um okay um so uh so let's go back up here coding challenges um i saw some good uh good ones that i will just like kind of roll out here right now so um i i think i'm not going to differentiate what's a coding challenge versus a cabana video fractal flame is like my number one you know the white whale so to speak for me right now um people are saying um uh tower of hanoi a tetris is one i've always wanted to do we could do that this summer sometime let's make a list uh aunt colony um do i i have langston's aunt already um so um if that's what it's called uh i'm looking at image to ascii it's a great idea image to ascii that's a fun one lava lamp coding challenges c sound um uh yeah so i guess i could do it as a coding challenge like basic like simple queue learning table like nondeep learning that feels like that could be a good coding challenge um slime mold simulation uh sebastian lag um uh react to make a gui for p5 sketches if that's really wanted by the audience i kind of want to get back to just the here's an interesting algorithm here's how it makes a pretty picture please go make it prettier make it interactive do do with it what you will so i'm a little bit more interested in that right now than some of the more utilitarian content but i'm not opposed to that langdon's aunt did i say langston p5 glitch library would be interesting to explore uh for sure um okay 2d platformer game shaders shaders shaders by the way there is an incredible live stream um uh by uh i don't know if she's still watching the coding train but she was uh i would see her in the chat here and there eliza sj um i know that shar styles has been appearing as a guest and maybe eliza sj has a does anybody know what i'm talking about this shader streaming on twitch uh for your transform with deep learning mandelbrot set ray marching ascii rotating cube forward circles i don't know what that is 2d platformer i mean a 2d platformer i sort of have i not done anything like that falling sand i like that uh open simplex noise i have a video i mean i have a video where i use it in p5 flutter yeah that's another not so not so interested right now uh freya homer has a lot of stuff on shaders grain graphics and similar stuff thank you for that next excellent um uh asteroids game i do have one already a connect five well i do want to do connect four also i saw that um um stand up maths had um something about spot it which is maybe called like doppel in the uk but um that could be fun to do um uh i don't um um five okay run one it's a 3d platformer okay that's interesting run one okay um math equation to graph all right i think i've got a good list here of some things that came up um let me also just go over to uh issues because one of the things that i do so you can post ideas here um with the read with the relaunch of the website maybe part of that will be a new tool to take suggestions but one of the things oh sudoku yeah i really um sudoku i would love to do whether it's just generate puzzles and or solve them that i would love to do but um one of the things that i do is i will often um assign them to myself if i see it as something interesting so um wave function collapse i remember that as being a thing uh wave function collapse slide puzzle i love that idea that's a oh auto encoder is something i really want to learn how to do mathematical marbling sure why not i don't remember what that was but that sounds cool uh pie challenge i gave marching squares marching cubes i did that derom curve um where i lost where i am durham curve i should be linking to these but that's okay fibonacci spiral spacex pie music these are a lot of pie things quad trees load bites these are old things that i think i'm fractal flame though i really want to do that ulum spiral i don't know why this like i'm um ascii art generator has always been one okay i've got a good list here i'm just taking a peek at the chat uh chess 3dl system trees with procedural i did 2048 already do have a whole video series about that um dobbles that's what it's called yes spot it uh dobble yeah so okay um all right so this is good i'm gonna hit save on this this is a nice kind of set of goals for the summer i really want my focus to be this kind of content um we'll see how i do um but that's that's that all right what's next uh i would like to look at some community contributions because i haven't done that for a while and i do have my community contributions theme song yes that's right you the viewers of the coding train periodically watch the videos and make your own projects based on the content that i make because i create content i create the content the content is created by me that is what i love to think of myself as a content creator that's the worst term ever everybody hates it can we come up with something else um so is this music too loud so let's go to so what what am i talking about here if i go to any one of my recent videos we can see here things that people have made related to the particular video and i could click on challenges just oh let's uh let's get a random number let's do it let's do it this way let's get a random number if only i had some way of getting random numbers right ah if only i had some way of getting random numbers between 1 and 161 uh allow allow allow here we go now i can't by the way i've lost my book i have no idea where it is it's somewhere in this house i don't know where it is so i don't have it today i do have the bell 69 i hate the universe the universe is the worst 85 that'll be edited out later let's go to coding challenge 85. the internet why internet what's 85 i used to do so many of these here we go oh game of life this is a good one this is a good one all right now whoa we've got a lot of great ones all right all right everybody all right so this is one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirty forty fifteen sixteen the seventeen if i counted that correctly let's give us a random number between one and seventeen number four one two three four the greg of life oh this is kind of awesome first of all greg brilliant title i love that this is called the greg of life that's totally amazing everybody should have their own the your first name of life or whatever name you so choose okay um whoa this must be greg i assume with a bunch of different expressions and then i can do gender step forward i actually have not seen this one this is so brilliant oh that is amazing oh greg uh i could just watch this all day this is so fun and bizarre now am i right that it's different expressions or am i imagining that let's zoom in on this again let's do pause like look here yeah these are definitely different i don't know how many there are but these are distinctly different expressions great job greg it's pretty awesome um all right let's look for one more on this page number 16 is well if i counted correctly would be this one simple game of life by unoriginal pun click where you want to activate or deactivate cells c to swap one oh cool oh i love that so this is really cool there's something in the game of life there are various repeating patterns so first of all if you don't know what the game of life is boy do i have good news for you i've got a whole video about it you can take a look at it it's probably about 45 minutes long um it is a cellular automata system it's a cellular automaton and what that means is there is a system of cells each cell has a state in this case just on or off white or black and its new state is based on um what its neighbor state um what its neighbor state are so states are so um and um there are some wellknown patterns one of which is called a glider and it looks like um through key presses i can kind of add gliders to this simulation and watch it uh play out great work i love that c to swap color oh interesting i kind of like it this way it was uh kind of a big glare there so great work um terrific um great work all right let's go for um i want to i'm giving myself till like just like five more minutes so let's go back to uh what was the maximum coding challenge again it was like 183 um 161 i don't know where i got 183 from my brain is completely nonfunctional these days uh let's try this again coding challenge number 12. oh that's going to be an oldie oh throwback time uh let's go to coding challenge number one two three four five six seven eight nine ten ten ten 10 10 11 12. ooh the lorenz attractor all right let's take a look at this to the challenge we go and we've got three we've got three two by one carlos i'm surprised by the way that this coding challenge only has three contributions associated with it because this is quite a um i think uh quite ripe for the reinvention for the for putting your own uh twist on it so i i feel a little silly uh picking a random between one and three let's just look at all three of these um so here we have whoa okay that is cool so these are particles moving along the path there is a whole there uh so this is just the lorenz attractor pattern which presumably if i when i made that video i created this um but i did not do it in such a way with thinking about color and putting particles to move along it now these i guess if i uncheck this now i don't see the particles this is also a nice 3d scene that i can rotate around that is really amazing oh so pretty let's put the particles back what's compared to ah oh compare draws the lorenz attractor like sort of expands it out as a path that is really cool and i could take the particles out oh but there's compare there's are there two going on here i thought i saw two no maybe not so i don't know what's the what is the um rule by which the color changes ah yeah there are two so they're slightly different i see so they're slightly different initial conditions the initial conditions here there you know there's these three variables one is 2.00 one is 2.05 so this is kind of the theory of a chaotic system this socalled butterfly effect uh tiny changes in initial conditions result in large global changes um so i can hit randomize i see and then we get ah it's just randomized i try different initial conditions this is really cool uh preset is what it started as uh butterflies um oh it just has butterflies like going along the path i love that that is really wild this is amazing open controls uh curve animate curve butterflies uh preset i lost the um let me just refresh the page oh wow is it like using local storage to remember ah that's kind of nuts um and can i change these parameters at all guess not i don't know what's going on here um i don't know what to do oh i went to a different page for the butterflies that's why it was a different page for the butterflies got it okay this is amazing i could play with this all day um i am super impressed uh thank you to juan carlos for this amazing contribution um and i think we just actually saw the third one which is the lorenz attractor with butterflies by the way just to look at like what is the actual code from the challenge the code from the challenge is just this um i i guess i have the um the orbit controls or something and this is actually i think i did this in processing so this port is thank you to whoever did this port um but you can see um that the code to the actual challenge is quite simple it's is much simpler it's just the basic pattern okay let's look at alejo cortinas lorenz attractor resolume arena plugin i have no idea what that means let's click on it to see so this is the repository of a resolume arena plugin using processing and the lorenz attractor i don't know what this plugin is does anybody know so this is um what is this it's like a media server oh interesting for like vj software interesting that's really cool so maybe this is some way of getting your processing visualization into this other software that you can use to sort vj a concert or a party pretty interesting um gjk collision detection algorithm um is a is a suggestion that's coming oh wolfram so i do want to do a video on the wolfram elementary ca um that is vj software thank you to um joss in the chat more ideas from stig okay i got i'm gonna add more ideas um later let me move on i have one minute left in my community contributions section on let's this probably needs an update but let me go over to discord real quick we're going to get one more in i am going to type in the bot command wheel and that's going to bring me the reason why i didn't go to this first is i feel like this hasn't been updated in a while but this is actually a wheel and i can spin this wheel a wheel of contribution that i should get one is called look here and look here is also by uh jay ponce uh i already looked at one of jay ponce's contributions uh so in a way i feel like i should pick another one but uh i have seen this one this is really cool so i have a video about purlin noise loops uh and making these sort of blobby patterns with them i remember seeing this one now okay let's try to get one more let's spin this wheel again kotch and i know it's not pronounced koch but that's just how i have to say it right now uh ah unrog is that a rock watching uh anurag is a regular viewer of the coding train uh let's see uh we've got the uh and we've got again i should probably learn uh how to use this wonderful.gui javascript library which allows a lot of just a quick way to create an interface to play with a lot of parameters in a visualization algorithm okay everyone i can close all these out and we are going to move on to our next segment which is where you the viewer vote on the thing that i will do in the second half of this live stream to launch the summer the summer of the coding challenge oh this is going smashingly well today all right so so i'm looking here i have this uh project that i began on a live stream many moons ago um and uh various contributors have if i go here and look uh at the history here various contributors have added a whole bunch of things and features and visual ideas and the idea for this is that it is a system by which i can spin up a poll i can uh send the link out of the poll to the chat and then i can watch the results come in live as an overlay on my live stream so let's and i haven't looked at this probably in about six months uh january february march april may you know five months four months four or five months so i already have it um cloned here onto my desktop let me run npm uh can i just say npm start is that how you do it so now i've got the uh poll running and all right so what i would like to do now whoops is create a poll okay but we're going to attempt this summer all right we're going to do may what's today's date 7th may 7th 2021 live all right so let's pull a few of the options from uh of something and something that i might begin to explore so today it's just this is just a trial run an experiment an exploration if you will um so if i go back to um uh rainbow topics and i go to my summer 2021 file and let's see like one of these um so this i could definitely begin to explore today fractal flame um i could begin to explore the idea of doing tetris today i like this image to ascii uh uh the slime old simulation i'm interested in i'm just picking a bunch uh i'm getting uh shaders not today 2d platformer not today falling sand connect4 again i'm um let's oh can i not have more options i only get five options okay that's a feature i need well simon's gonna be very upset if i don't put generator functions in here let's put uh generator functions um and let me let's hit create and see what happens here all right so now here's my poll and uh i'm going to switch over here for a second and i'm going to see if i can um get this as an overlay so i want to know what is my local ip now i realize that i have to figure out a way for all of you to vote i've got a plan don't worry um oh and body simulation would have been a good one for me to um to add uh all right so hold on this is this is not science this is this is just figuring out the live poll this is not the final poll this is just seeing if the poll this is like a metapol a trial run of the poll itself so i am going to my system preferences and i am looking for my ip address i don't think it matters if anybody sees it but i'm just looking for my local ip keyboard number two here oh it's loud okay thank you um real serious stuff i'm doing here oh wait okay hold on hold on i know what i need to do here oh 196. no wonder this site can't provide a secure connection uh all right let's not do it this way um um don't worry everyone things are gonna happen you're gonna see got it got it got it got it got it got it um i'm working on something here um okay great okay here we go i know the music left but everything's going to be fine all right i'm getting there okay why is the background not a transparent toggle overlay mode but i can't interact with it i can't interact with this page in obs so this has a whole like interface but um all right we're gonna do it this way um uh transform reset transform no no you silly not of the camera oh i messed up this thing transform uh reset transform there we go uh let's uh how's this for live streaming entertainment um crop this out here i can't click on that in obs so i need a way of so this i'm now realizing some features that i need okay so in a moment i'm going to give you the place to vote um i am going to somebody could so it is a poll so i want to go to the vote link okay hold on everyone uh wait where did i post that did it get deleted no i wanted it there did someone delete my message thinking that i didn't want to put it there i want to put it there because i need it that's how i go back and forth between the computers you're all welcome to it in the members channel now i lost it i have to get it again i don't want to post it in links yet i'm not ready for that this is we're trying this trial run okay now we're going to get this url and go to vote instead no oh uh vote okay now what you are seeing here is the page and this link can now if anybody wants to put it i want it to vote first i'll vote for fractal flame got one vote and if i go back to here there we go so at the moment what should happen is as soon as i post this link for people to vote and you're looking for the discord link here it is i'll post it in discord and somebody can so the place by the way if you're not in the coding train discord you should join right now um and i'm gonna post here in the links uh channel the place where you can vote oops it needs to be not poll vote so i'm pretty sure that this is now the url for you to click on and if i go back here the votes should start coming in um if somebody could crosspost this it was a moderator into the youtube chat that would be great and we'll see if the internet is friendly to me today or if people decide to like destroy everything that i worked so hard for fractal flame is really winning out here i'm ready for the votes to come in wrong link all right everybody whoops all right what's going wrong everybody why why can you not vote okay so i'm gonna go back to me here this is go to vote uh well i've already voted maybe that's why it should be that i just change let's go to an incognito window huh so what am i missing here everybody i was able to vote does it only take one vote is there some kind of uh pull yeah why is it redirecting to the poll link um i'm reading the chat here uh coding challenge fix yeah yeah i'm using ngrok just to host it because i don't feel like deploying it right now and i don't understand why um it's not allowing me to go to the vote go to vote let's go to this one yeah this one see how if you go to the vote and the id so sing let's hit yes and then if i go back to vote yeah once i voted i can never get there again why is that all right we're gonna have to i guess debug this no the point of this is this has to work this this has to be a project that gets finished that i can use regularly i guess i could just work on it and test it um outside of live streaming because now it is noon and i have completely failed um but i don't understand why uh why this is happening and i guess i could look at the code um let's let's look at what's going on here all right uh let's see here um like there should be a vote route where is create newest oh i can always go to newest i forgot about that pull pull id vote pull id ah if i have voted uh redirect to this all right that's i guess to like keep you only voting once but it's not working yeah why is engroc is the problem interesting so this protection to keep you from only voting once is an issue because everyone it thinks everyone is the same person because i'm using ngrok so really i should deploy this i think i have this deployed to glitch i just was trying not to uh use it there all right okay let's try this again um let's uh let me go to my glitch account here and just switch over here for a second um to get to a live poll okay so now i'm coming back so i'm gonna um i'm going to uh kill ngrok so ngrok is like my favorite thing which is a way of just like spinning up a open to the public web server from my laptop on whatever port i'm running my node application it's so useful for testing and i just find it to be delightfully wonderful but uh i think yeah everybody's but i uh and i know that things like straw poll exists and all these other services that do exactly this the point is i want my own i work i want to use my own um so let's go to um glitch here and um i am going to um it's not um see if this will wake itself up here's a lot of people who contributed to this uh this is not i haven't boosted this one maybe i should boost this project so that it wakes up um because i do have a pro account um let me check that out here um and i'm going to uh what should i unboost i need to unboost something oh i can unboost this and boost this so the live poll is now being boosted and okay great great now the question is uh i'm just checking something here got it oh no wrong website aha okay hold on everyone hold on i'm going to do something quite radical which is a live pull i know you can't see what i'm doing this makes for really amazing live streaming uh all right so what i'm doing here is i am grabbing this particular github repo which is the full project i am going over to and i just need to make sure the environment yeah does not show up great i'm going to go over to the glitch project which is here i'm going to tools import the import from github going to paste this in so i'm now just like wiping this and bringing in the full project uh and uh i'm going to uh fix something really quick it's gonna go to the readme i'm gonna go back to my camera i'm going to put a little passwordy thingy in it which is going to be highly secure and now i'm going to go back to here everything's going to work everything's going to be great now we're going to show in a new window all right so now we everyone should be able to go to live dash poll dash coding dash train dot glitch dot me um you won't see anything there yet on this shirt by the way is foreshadowing a future live stream that i need to do this month because i'm work i have a special project which is all about artificial intelligence and pineapples so i got to come back um why is this not waking up no no um working says philippe all right let's look at tools logs okay it was installing everything the server is running okay great so i should be able to um there we go now here we go we're really really gonna get this to go right now now um enter question here may 7th 2021 question mark yeah so you the the sign in is only required for creating the poll so uh i am going to be able to create the poll by signing in you will be able to vote once i've created the poll without signing in so and um i will uh quickly do something here um i am now updating the password because it was a default password that is probably very easy for all of you to guess um can i restart everything that's fine um okay so create a poll uh may 7th 2021 end body uh i forgot already uh well fractal flame this is just a test of the pole it's not the real pole what did i have in that pole uh connect image to ascii image to ascii uh auto encoder no no no no 2d platformer no no p5 glitch i love to look at p5 glitch actually right now uh p5 glitch what is a generator function in js okay create this poll all right so now this should be the link for voting okay so i am going to pick fractal flame that's my one vote now what i need to do and i think if if if nobody didn't like can i just go to like latest no what was the route there's a route that's like um i think it's in the readme actually um create newest newest so i'm gonna go to newest that didn't work oh just like this great awesome okay oh i forgot to add tetris sorry everybody this is not the real poll this is a test of a poll now i'm going to go to here and this should always be uh this particular link i'm gonna have to redo the design because the whole point was it for it to be kind of transparent paste and now if i say newest i knew i was hacked i knew i was hacked oh you were all so mean to me why do you have to be so mean i changed the password does it still not work redirects back to once one person votes this is going so well ladies and gentlemen and everyone else please test your software before you deploy it live on a stream i don't think anybody's watching this anymore [Laughter] at least i was hacked and i do need to eat lunch after this so this is a good sign all right i'm gonna um uh let's go here pizza i have a question wait where's my pole hold on i'm i'm doing something here people create a poll um hold on everyone uh may 7th tetris n body fractal flame pizza generator function all right pull voting link try going to and i'm going to put this in discord try going here i put a link in discord uh and now let's see can i refresh this page how do i refresh the page if i just go back and forth how do i force obs to refresh newest i'm gonna cry same poll redirecting it's the same as before but i'm not even getting uh the pull to come up i boosted this app it should be fast you should be responding fast i could just get rid of that thing in the code and let everybody vote as many times as possible let's do that uh so here we are let's go to um uh where is it uh server web.js let us change and not um so this is in the vote let's not redirect so i'm taking that out so that redirect is now gone which will allow everybody to vote as many times as you want which i'm sure what could possibly go wrong there okay so i'm now gonna go to go to vote um this is going remarkably well whoa oh my god help stop please everybody why delete why why did you i can't i what did not oh everybody found packed my thing okay i've got an idea you're all i'm gonna pull this car over right now and we're not getting pizza no pizza all right it's time for me to take a break this was a big failure i will get a fiveminute break you all did this to yourself or one of you did it to everybody else um yeah each time you go to newest there's a new poll because guess what so i could it's fine only i was supposed to be able to i did change my password for whatever reason it's like the like local storage um and it is nice that it's very wholesome what everybody is uh uh posting there as the polls but um this this is i'm sorry everyone we will we will we will we will just go and use straw poll or something else or during the break i will i'm gonna reset the app with a new password and start again but while you're all here it's time for me thank goodness for having friends in the world who want to support the coding train because it allows me to take a moment away from the failure that is this live poll project and talk to you about something called um brilliant so i um i said before at the top of this stream that um you're here because presumably uh you're interested in learning very little learning has been going on would you like some actual learning maybe you want to learn something new in stem maybe computer science math and logic maybe you just want to learn about how the world works what is it that you should do well you could watch educational live streams on youtube but you can see very little learning going on so i i i'm i'm kind of using the this the sort of prepared remarks about brilliant but what i really want to say is that like actually for me the best way uh the way that i discover new algorithms and new concepts and learn uh concepts that i've maybe heard about but didn't have a chance to explore um is by uh is through interactivity um and so brilliant is a website and app that's built off this very this very principle about learning while doing solving in real time um you can see here that that you know if you want if you're interested in coding this is brilliant's course about learning to code with python um this is actually um one of one of my favorite courses that they have about geometry fundamentals so you can see here through explanations through interactive diagrams you can learn about um the pythagorean theorem so and it really like brilliant has something for everybody so basics of math science computer science there's even topics on cryptocurrency and neural networks um so if you would like to join me and a community of 8 million learners and educators today just go and you can sign up for free at brilliant.org codingtrain um and if you would like to unlock the premium subscription you will get 20 off or at least the first 200 people to do so by um using that link so um well i actually want to go and take a look at that geometry fundamentals course because it's one of the ones that they sent me um to to take a look at so let me pull away the banner let me not go to my uh and let me go to brilliant.org i'm going to go here to courses and oh beautiful geometry well that sound these are courses that i've worked on recently so you can see what i'm taking this is one that i would really recommend this infinity course if i'm gonna look at fractal flames um lots of related stuff between but i wanted to look for the geometry fundamentals one um if anyone sees it you can see there's just so many courses let's look for geometry fundamentals so let's take a look and let's this is not a course that i've started yet so i'm going to just start it right now and see what up see what happens okay geometry is a way of thinking by looking at the world in shapes and angles we can combine reason with our knack for spotting by the way you can use brilliant on your own you don't need to listen to a person like me just read it to you but um so unfolding sliding rearranging and cutting let's get started look at this beautiful so just at a minimum like i always i love the brilliant uh courses because i see these amazing animations and i think how would i program those in p5 so let's at least do the first one okay it's tempting to search for a relevant formula and calculate until an answer emerges but this course will be looking for ways to jump directly so we're kind of using our intuition so just using my intuition in the shape below i mean it doesn't say that but is there more yellow or more white so i'm gonna kind of assume that it's the same just by like the way the the question was phrased but um let's let's try to like puzzle this out so i can see very clearly that there's four squares of yellow and i can see that there's one square here of white but this and this makes up a second one so two this plus this was uh i think they're only like one two three ah there's four squares of white because there's these if i if i kind of zoom in so i can like point to it um so one uh two three four oh i need a bigger field of view for my camera um so let's just say they're equal hit submit and i'm correct um and if we look here oh um and by the way it's ah it's gonna look at this beautiful so i just wanna make nice like animations like this with p5 so um and um this is actually really cool because one of the things for me that is a big uh that's part of my life is um working with my kids who are in fourth and sixth grade um on their math homework i'm like the goto help with your math homework dad um and um actually like i'm seeing so many uh relationships between these fundamentals courses on brilliant and the kind of stuff they're doing in their math homework so this is actually a lot of fun um for me to do with them um as well so um i hope you will consider um brilliant i'm trying to just check here if there's anything else i wanted to say about it um there also is an app that you can use and i'll just remind you that you can go to brilliant.org codingtrain i'm going to take a short few minute break to see if i can figure out what to do about the live poll situation and if you have nothing to do during this time um go ahead and sign up all right uh i will be right back in about five minutes for the roll rest of this live stream i'll be going to about 1pm try to do some actual coding here okay be right back do so do do so and we're back well i don't know am i doing this live streaming thing right i think i'm definitely not i've got a little bit of time i'm gonna just let's let's june june is gonna be my month right june is busting out all over it will be uh the image to ascii is quite um is really quite taking off here which i love the idea of exploring that right now so that's looking good i can give this maybe a little bit longer here to see what happens it's interesting as i was kind of imagining this would like live sort based on um uh what has the most votes but it does not appear to be doing that i like this exploring image to ascii kind of and i'm glad one person got my carousel reference all right we're at 100 votes image to ascii with the 40 close to 40 percent um it sorts on refresh all right there we go nice little refresh there uh image to ascii oh things are changing what is an auto encoder great question so an auto encoder is a particular kind of neural network architecture that receives an input and attempts to produce an output that matches the input now wouldn't that be that would be the easiest thing in the world to do if you maintained all of the information throughout the neural network but the an autoencoder takes the inputs and passes them through layers that have fewer units fewer nodes than the amount of inputs there were so in a way it's very similar to a kind of compression algorithm it's taking information compressing it into smaller sets of numbers and then decompressing it back out and it is kind of the foundational um it's a foundational i in my view example for how different kinds of generative deep learning based systems work so if you want to look at a generative adversarial network gan or other kinds of neural network architectures that are used for synthetic media i feel like an auto encoder is a great place to start and look how many people are voting for it now all right i think this is um i think this is pretty good i think we've i think we've seen uh enough here and um all right so here's what i hope um here's what i hope i'm gonna put this away here's what i hope will come out of this um i'm going to work on some ideas for how i might explore making um um ascii art essentially out of an image i've got about a half an hour right now to explore that um what i hope then is that this will be the beginnings of what i would take to a um an edited produced video that would kind of walk through building a image to ascii art generator so this is just a small exploration to um explore say the word explored so many times where i'm going with this all right i think it makes sense to do this in p5 oh i'm exhausted this live stream streaming stuff is exhausting okay i gotta i gotta i need to rethink my life here what am i doing i gotta make this something about this isn't is i'm off my game got a june june june is going to be coming up soon all right so how are we into this first let's get an image something high contrast something cute let's start with a kitten um let us go to um an image that is in creative commons license this looks like it will be good let's uh grab this image um let's say let's put this on the desktop as a kitten let us now upload okay save uh upload this file whoa look at this no i'm limited to twitter i've uploaded all i can upload all right well let me just move over to here for a second and uh also get rid of this uh let me just check out i'm sure i can remove uh from my account very easily i'm going to my assets here i just i'm afraid of what might pop up not that i use the p5 web editor for any nefarious business but there must be like some particularly large files can i sort by size no okay um but i'm gonna start deleting some files here oh weird what's that thumbnail pixel yeah this i can get rid of this is always a good idea to just randomly start deleting files to do this more methodically later this i don't need i'm looking for files that are in megabytes um zoom annotations copy all right did i i'm still at 101 percent i could just use a different account what is this uh let's delete this file am i under hit refresh i'm at 98 everybody look look what i have done i got myself down to 98 so i could upload the kitten again uh let's see okay this is going so well okay uh okay now let's upload the kitten upload upload upload file uh where is that uh downloads maybe is this the kitten no desktop kitten okay great i'm now going to add preload i would like to see the size of this image um 284 177. it's an interesting uh size for an image okay things are looking up i finally have a kitten i have some code how will i turn this into ascii art so one thing that i could do is i could sort of have i mean there's different ways of doing this and a simple approach which isn't a great one is that um i could just sort of think about the relative brightness of every pixel and i could draw a corresponding character that um that corresponds corresponds to the bright that that ha that that has a kind of brightness to it so in other words um let's think about this um like what if i can what if i have uh what if i loop through every character and evaluate its brightness i mean just just as a just as a quick demonstration of what i mean let's get at least something going here where um i am going to let me let me make a um canvas that is four times as big let me put a background on it uh i would like to and actually this image i would like to down sample it i don't have to do a lot of um manual math in the code right now so let me down sample this to 100 by 62. and i'm going to just call this kitten100 and upload this one maybe something like this already exists a table of like uh ascii characters to corresponding brightness values but i will show you what i mean and then i want to do um let's just do times 10 i really should do it down you know what am i doing here let's down sample it even more let's go to like um 48 oh i'm doing percent no i want pixels oh of course it's 48 because okay let's go to 48 call this kitten 48. and let's upload this one upload this file and uh let's say 48 and i'm going to have a variable i'm going to call it uh the scale i don't want to use the word scale because that's a p5 function um i could say like dim for dimensions let's say 10 so i'm going to create a canvas that is kitten width times some dimension kit and height times that dimension which is 10. uh and now i think i can move this over here this over here and there we go all right so this this is kind of making sense now what i would like to do then is say four let i equal zero i is less than kitten dot and let me just get these into some variables um because i don't have to type kitten.with over and over again with and height um let's do a nice little nested loop and just let's draw a rectangle i'm going to say no fill and this should be j and x is i times the the dimension but whoops y is j times the dimension then i'm going to draw a rectangle at x y of that size uh stroke zero so now i should at least see a grid that matches that image and i need another okay so i've got a grid that matches that image and this i also think is too small so i want to do a just sort of double the size there we go i don't have a tremendous amount of room for both the code and the visual but that's okay this will do so now let's just make sure i can kind of access the brightness of every pixel that's a way that i could start so i would like to say um let's say a kitten load pixels and honestly i'm let's i'm going to make this sort of static right now i don't need to have an animation so i'm going to put this all just in setup make sure this still works and then the pixel index is i plus j times the width times 4 this is for um i wonder actually if it would make sense to just use the p5 get function but i'm going to do this in the manual way i'm going to get the red value is then kitten dot pixels index i'm gonna need the green value and the blue value so this is index plus zero the next one is green the next one is blue you might be wondering like what are you even doing well what i'm doing here is has to do with loading the image and looking at every pixel individually and unpacking each pixel's color all of those colors are in a giant array that goes rgb alpha rgb alpha rgb alpha the alpha doesn't matter to me right now there's no transparency but and in theory if i do this we should see there's a low resolution blown up version of that kitten pretty pretty pretty good now what i would like to look at is the brightness so the um the brightness is r plus g plus b divided by three and i'm going to say if the brightness is greater than some threshold and maybe we'll make that threshold right now i'm going to just say 127 to sort of be halfway fill 0 or maybe like to make it brighter otherwise fill uh zero let's see if we can find a reasonable you know i could i could attach this to a slider now oh i want it to be maybe a higher threshold but but this is how i like to work there we go can you kind of see can you see that kitten there there's that kitten oh it's so cute so now i want to try something let's say text font courier i want to use a fixed width font and i'm going to say text zero x y and let me and then otherwise no tech no no text so what will this do here getting somewhere getting somewhere making some ascii art here okay i'm seeing some suggestions in the chat for each pixel write three different ascii characters depending on rgb values but using a blend mode oh i like that idea um so let's try uh text size uh dimension so there's my ascii art kitten um fete is saying this is a very basic list of cars i use but obviously the font matters from lowest to highest out lower to highest alpha all right let's try this oh and yes jupa is saying shouldn't rgb be weighted for a brightness calculation yes so that's definitely an improvement i could make darth k does kind of look like darth kitten so hold on i need these characters i'm taking these characters and i'm putting them into the discord uh oh whoops a wrong keyboard um let's try this um let's try this suggestion from um from feta i believe and i put that into discord here let me try getting these characters from lightness to dark i think um and so now if i go into the code and i think one thing i should do is crop the kitten so just to like give myself some more space here so let me um pull up this kitten 48 and let's see if i can crop it around oh the width was it's the height is 30. so let's do 36 by 30. oops so let's call this kitten 36. and i i you know the probably the potential to do this at slightly higher resolution is there so this should help me fit everything there we go now i've got a lot more room see that kitten there so let me go back and get uh these characters so this is interesting this is from i forgot that chat message i assumed right i should do background black and the text white that i could definitely do this looks to me like it is characters that go from uh that i can try using from brightest to darkest or darkest to brightest if they're white i wanted to do this with dom elements ultimately because i think it'll be much more interesting to select it but let's that'll be a separate step um let's try this suggestion of having the background be zero and i'm gonna put on the auto refresh throw caution to the wind here um and then change this to um here to be fill 255. there we go now what i would like to do is i want to get an index so the brightness index is map brightness which goes from 0 to 255 to go from 0 to what is this called cars.length i'm going to call this text and then call this text and then so what i'm doing is i'm just trying to like whatever the brightness might be go and pull a character from that array um and i need to floor this but i'll say the the character the car the ch is uh text index oh dot car at floor the brightness index and then now i don't need to worry about the threshold uh do we see the kitten there now i do kind of like the idea of keeping the so this is pretty interesting here i sort of feel like i probably should have a um wow so this image is kind of an interesting one to pick where i'm not getting any uh like i definitely want to like put in a space but like i can do a lot of this is sort of like sort of like a way of thresholding it just by adding more spaces so that's kind of interesting um so this is pretty good actually it looks more like an owl i agree let's take out one more now you know i think there's i think we this this list of characters is somewhat uh questionable um oh yeah and maybe these weren't meant to be here yeah yeah i don't think those are really meant to be there um is it interesting to have so i think this makes the image harder to read i mean obviously a lot has to do with this particular image but i like this as a kind of arbitrary way of thresholding it yeah all right that's pretty good that's pretty good okay now i would like this to actually be a dom elements so that i could um select this and copy paste it somewhere so let's see how i could do that um so the first thing that i want to do is go into the css and um let's just uh let's enforce a background color actually let's let's keep it i'm going to do it i'm going to invert it for the css because i feel like most text environments that's not necessarily true at terminal all right let's let's keep it so now what i need to do is create a div and ultimately let's change this to i kind of i think it might be helpful for me to see both for a moment so let's do let me see if i can create a div above the canvas i don't think no it's always going to be um so i need that how do you do how do you set a font color in css is it this or is it text color no text color i don't know css color ah there we go uh font size oh font family okay a font size okay let's try that for right now okay and let's just keep it at 16. so now what i would like to do is um let's make uh let's call it ascii div i don't need all these global variables because i'm not using an animation loop so this is kind of silly so let's do this um i just i think it makes sense to just have this all be one function because ultimately so i'm just kind of cleaning this up here okay so now i have this ascii div and so what i would like to do is create a big string i think this makes sense i mean i probably should use like the pre tag or something using a monospace func okay um okay so let's make a um let's make a string i'll call it output is an empty string and here output plus equals that character but after every oh i'm going down this has to be the inside loop still the same output plus every character and then in the outer loop output plus equals a line break although a line break won't actually show up and then i want to say ascii div dot html that output whoops oh okay so this is all of the characters but i need to use a nonbreaking space and then i think this has to be like this right if it's going to end up showing up on an html page okay that makes sense and then i should be saying um if character is a space um then is it this like nonbreaking space like that ah oh look at that oh and it made it skinnier okay so now i can do no canvas because i don't i kind of don't want the canvas i can comment it out um and so so this is all just canvas stuff so is a threshold is no longer relevant and so is that so if i i'm just commenting the canvas stuff out in case we want to put it back in and i think it would make more sense for this to be an array but then i could have the nonbreaking space in it okay css line height to make it a square how do i do that um how do i make a css line height okay i don't know the line height line height that's better right i don't know what the i don't know what it's supposed to be but let's try 14. does that look like a kitten to you and in theory like i could copy paste this and then go to discord and paste it into discord so this is cool because we could make like a discord bot that you give it an image and it returns you back to ascii art the thing about this though people who make ascii art generally they're like cleverly like contouring the image so like i could do edge detection and put like slashes around it so i think um i think there could be like a different way of doing this that might be a bit more effective but this is kind of good so now now the question is like what like what happens when i start using other images lower resolution images or higher resolution images but i think i would leave that for all of you to sort of like sort out because it's almost one o'clock well so this would so so here's the question for you i used to do stuff like this during my live streams in a more performative way knowing that i was going to then edit that out and make it into a standalone video the coding challenge would be like ascii from image but now the question is oh oh doing making this an oh whoa whoa hold your horses everybody duplicate i mean what is wrong with me shiffman uh video uh video equals create capture create video capture i can't remember how this works create capture video is that how it works um so yep okay so now video dot size uh 36 by 20 24 probably okay video video well i don't need i think this makes more sense oh but i'm not in draw anymore okay hold on um this is gonna be cool if i can get this to work um um uh remove child no canvas what what did i miss oh boy this is bad um oh no canvas should not be here there we go that's pretty wild and this is by the way this is a dom element this is not canvas i should be able to select that that is pretty cool um the thresh holding use 80 columns so um does it make sense to just well that's just well this was fun this was a good little mini project that you could take with you today uh here is oh wait i kind of messed this up like what's um like i could do this like a lot more wait let's just make it confused oh the dimensions is sort of not really doing anything right now because the the size of the font um all right i'm gonna i'm gonna just i forget that am i using dimensions anymore no this is no longer relevant i was just using that for when i had a canvas so really like how big could i get this uh too big oh but the video height sorry doesn't make any sense just want to see sort of performance wise ooh what did i do oh no that's it's just too big it can't and it's like wrapping the text okay too big i just wanna like what's a kind of reasonable like if i go now to um share and go to uh full okay i messed up something something is off in my uh math oh this is so okay i am a really annoying person who has made quite an error in judgment in the way that i have named my variables oh i don't need this anymore what is wrong with me okay here we go stop there we go but that also i'm not really getting the ascii effect there that's still to let's go um 80 by 60 i think probably makes more sense i also want to say video dot hide there we go and look at me decrease the number of spaces people are saying yeah maybe that makes sense in this one yeah there we go now i'm getting much more detail look at the pineapples people look at the pineapples and what's cool about this i just want to show you is i'm going to say no loop oh wait why oh okay and i'm going to grab this and i'm going to go to discord my message is over 2000 characters well okay let's just get let's just get part of it still it's over 2000 characters how many characters is this the top of my head there we go there's the top of my head now in discord but you get the idea uh can i put this in like a gist here i am folks look that's a that's a pineapple right there pretty wild right i could use marching squares to add an ascii border with the slashes that's a super fun idea anyway so here's this is my question i'm wrapping up the stream now that it's 106. um and um the question i have is what should i do should i make now uh um should i make a um i could do this as a coding challenge so i could do this i've done it already now but i could kind of like walk through the building of it and kind of maybe there's some ideas of improvements um mallory brothers is asking for the code um oh andreas justin's ascii playground okay great thank you so two things here one is this is the code for um this i'm gonna put this into uh the discord channel so um here if you wanna grab this code oh anna salko anna salko has joined the passengers of the coding train welcome anna right on time i don't even know if you're watching this right now or that message just happened but you are here make sure you look for the special link to a google form so that you can get your stickers in the mail also you are in need of your very own random number stay tuned the next live stream we will be premiering uh kobe one uh discord manager st plays on discord has um rebuilt um along with the help also i believe from um david um this uh a new features to the choo choo bot to be able to assign random numbers generate random walk path pat patterns and those will be etched onto train whistles the summer of coding train is coming um welcome aboard anna oh you are there anna so um please come and join the discord and we'll get in touch for um in terms of how to get you your member rewards and all that kind of stuff and the discord by the way is open to everyone there are just some member channels for those of you who are able to join and support in that way i super appreciate it now back to what i was doing was so this is the code uh for that this particular sketch now let me go to and let me name this uh ascii video example and then let me also open i believe i had the one that was just the kitten um and this is the uh ascii kitten let's just make sure this is the right one right here's the ascii kin no computational mama first of all computational mama you might have what is possibly the best youtube username on the entire internet thank you for joining the coding train what you get is your very own random number i lost my random number book what do i do without my random number book come and join the discord we will get you your random number um uh assigned to you um and i know it's been some of you especially those of you who are at the um conductor level um ascii fractal flame is a brilliant idea um those of you who are at the conductor level have been waiting possibly uh up to at least two years for your custom train whistle that is next that is the num one of the the number one priorities to get to the bot the discord bot generating the random walk patterns was the first step uh jason hegland uh who makes all the merchandise designs and does all the coding train illustrated characters has been setting up with a laser etcher in uh in the support organ department um and so all of that is coming edge detection and the slashes is a wonderful uh next step so what was it that i was supposed to look at that was stig suggestion um ascii art andreas something like this um um i don't know if this is the right let's look at these two links under creativeapplications.net o is not a letter it's a circle uh is this what i'm looking for whatever this is it's going to be amazing whoa what is this even that's very loud cool uh digital art ascii and i should have jason browser race live coding playground stunning imagers with text okay i think this is what i'm looking for whoa okay interesting density oh look this is another set of characters i could use in reverse order just very very briefly let's go to think of all you could do with just like you can make a whole game now this way let's just try out of curiosity this and now i'm going to change this from txt to and i want to make sure i give credit to this um where is this uh from there and so now instead of getting it from txt it's from density now this is with it um density so that's interesting to see now this is inverted um so i could actually say density.length down to zero which would do it the other way around and then my instinct is to add a bunch of spaces but just to kind of like you know kind of doing what i did before just to sort of threshold it so we can see there's you know again the image that you pick how you choose to have this array of brightness characters i um is is pretty um interesting to think about but here's just like another another list of characters um awesome so all right so uh edge detection is exactly what i want to do um thank you everybody for tuning in thank you for the two new members did i paste this example into the into discord i did not so kitten i would love if any of you uh take this and do anything with it share it with me i would like to turn this into an actual um coding challenge video maybe i can refer to some of these other um artworks i do have to go it is 1 15. um there will be at least one more lot well there will be at least two more live streams in may because one will be and i can tell you the date of it the itp um let's look um let's go to itp.nyu.edu show um i will be doing in the evening of may 18th a live stream of the show itself it's all an online show so you shouldn't tune into the live stream you should actually just go and participate in the show itself let me put this link also in uh discord if you want to take a look at it um but there will be a live stream there will also be at least one more of these friday live streams in may um where i will be continuing to sort of get myself organized for the summer of coding challenges differentiate the rgb channel and use color text that is a great idea um sarvagya is asking about the holiday pins so all the holiday pins were sent out there were a couple that got returned because of address issues um and i believe that we've been in touch with you if that was the case but um send a message to the um to the moderation team on discord or write an email to merch at thecodingtrain.com if you were one of the holiday pin folks and there's an issue and you didn't get it so i do want to make sure everybody got their holiday pins a digit clock is a great idea so many possibilities thank you for tuning in um let me just play this goodbye song here while i have five percent of uh ipad battery left um and i will answer any questions that i see in the next uh two and a half minutes while i close out some of these links um let's see i'm looking to see if there's any questions um please make sure that you um take a look at the computer mouse conference um all the archives of all the talks and you could watch obviously the video the computer mouse video that i made on the coding train channel itself uh there's a little trolling going on asking me to prove the riemann hypothesis that won't be happening in the next uh what two minutes of this stream um how do you find the algorithm for any coding challenges challenge says coding with 3dv well not to be a i i am reminded now that i should give a quick thank you to the uh sponsor of today's live stream but brilliant.org codingtrain it's a wonderful interactive a website of lessons in education materials that you can sign up for and find a lot of algorithms to explore but another thing that i would highly recommend is something called the algorithm archive which is a project by um james schloss or there's a youtube channel lee ios leo s um and actually um um yeah there's this is just a wonderful collection of different kinds of algorithms with written texts and explanations this is just an amazing project so oh um and maybe um some of these computational geometry algorithms uh could be quite useful for this ascii art idea as well does itb have any international student program exchange so you should contact itp.inquiries i believe at nyu.edu i think that the address is on the website um there's lots of programs there's lots of international students there's a summer camp that you can actually join that's all online that's very reasonably priced so um but yeah contact the department directly um for that would you ever consider making a larger collaborative project yeah i consider all wonderful ideas thank you for that oh this is uh signing off now thank you for tuning in um see you next time on the coding train i really appreciate all of you uh goodbye as always i always forget that this dot this stock is this dot i'm going to do this this star this dot this star to this dot song never forget the this dot i'm going to say once again here we go it's look forward to cartesian coordination autotune and the internet will fix that for me unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what i get i'm really losing my mind okay let's do it the kids the kittens kittens and the kittens the kittens the kittens kids kittens i feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this is a this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it i'm really getting to something i need my sound effects that was invalid syntax i forgot there other bye everybody have a wonderful weekend see you soon
