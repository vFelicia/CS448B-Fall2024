00:00 - hello I think I am broadcasting live now
00:04 - welcome my name is Dan I have been
00:08 - spending about an hour trying to set up
00:12 - some lights in here and I'm looking at
00:13 - myself and I feel like I look a little
00:15 - bit reddish orange ish and then if I
00:18 - come over here to this camera view I
00:21 - look much paler so I still think I need
00:24 - to do some white balance work but if you
00:29 - are watching this live I don't know if
00:31 - anybody actually is please let me know
00:32 - in the chat if you can hear me okay if
00:35 - you can see me okay if the font and code
00:39 - is legible here and in particular if you
00:42 - can kind of read and see what's on the
00:45 - white board over here have a new white
00:51 - board and I that camera just went off
00:53 - I'm going to turn that back on one of
01:00 - these days I will begin these video
01:02 - streams without simply saying i'm
01:04 - testing but I'm still sort of in that
01:08 - process and I think next week I'm going
01:10 - to really be hitting the ground running
01:11 - although i think i'd still need got some
01:13 - lighting camera stuff that I've got to
01:17 - improve in here still ok are you there
01:19 - I'm gonna go check the chat everything
01:23 - ok says one person which is very nice to
01:26 - hear I've got three people watching I
01:28 - sent out an email announcement oops I'm
01:32 - going to check this computer here and
01:37 - looks pretty decent I'm going to check
01:40 - my ok and uh oh uh oh look at this ok so
01:53 - i signed up for mailchimp in order to
01:56 - take people's email addresses to send
01:58 - out e-mail announcements when i go live
02:01 - and i wrote a quick email is about one
02:04 - sentence with the link to youtube live
02:05 - and it says here i got a message for
02:08 - mailchimp back that says our automated
02:10 - abuse prevention system omnivore
02:12 - reviewed your account it detected
02:15 - content or actions with either conflict
02:17 - with our acceptable use policy or
02:19 - present a significant risks to our
02:21 - deliverability your account has been
02:23 - disabled you may login at any time to
02:25 - export and back up your account data
02:27 - download reports or close the account
02:29 - permanently so I i guess i sent it i
02:32 - just do it quickly i made it plain text
02:34 - and i pasted a link to youtube maybe
02:36 - that's somehow not something I'm
02:37 - supposed to do I have to look at that
02:38 - later so no one got that announcement
02:43 - yeah the so I only have four people
02:46 - watching currently live which is just
02:47 - fine because I'm kind of today is the
02:51 - kind of extra this plan makes a very
02:54 - strange sound no I pick that up I didn't
02:59 - really eat a very big breakfast and I
03:01 - haven't had lunch since 1230 what I have
03:02 - somewhere I have to go about one-thirty
03:04 - so I'm just going to give this a whirl
03:05 - and what I want to do is at least kind
03:09 - of try out my new white board I'm going
03:11 - to erase this and I'm going to go to my
03:16 - list of topics which is over here and I
03:23 - thought something that has been
03:25 - requested quite a few times is a p5 GS
03:29 - instance mode which is something you
03:31 - need if you want to namespace your
03:33 - javascript thing or if you want to you
03:36 - know have multiple canvases on a single
03:38 - page so i thought that might be a good
03:40 - topic just as kind of a one-off make a
03:43 - 10 to 15 minute tutorial about writing a
03:46 - sketch in p5 j/s instance modes that's
03:48 - what I plan to do I'm also happy here to
03:51 - enter any just general questions about
03:53 - processing or p5 whip up an example on
03:56 - the fly based on somebody's questions so
03:58 - you can ask those in the chat how's
04:02 - everybody doing here oh it's just me
04:04 - okay um alright so I'm think I'm gonna
04:11 - get started I should have gotten some
04:13 - water if you don't mind I'm gonna go get
04:16 - a glass of water and I'll be right back
04:18 - you will still be able to hear me
04:20 - because I have a wireless mic as I go
04:22 - and get water but I'll be right back
04:23 - talk amongst yourselves in the chat and
04:25 - I'll
04:25 - be right back
04:36 - let's get glass of water
05:02 - here I come back I'm coming back I have
05:05 - a turn it really should tape down the
05:08 - wires on the floor because there's a
05:09 - wire right there I could easily just
05:11 - drip over it but I'll do that another
05:12 - day ok let me check the chat I've got
05:14 - six people seven people people are
05:16 - joining so I've got to like stalling a
05:18 - little bit for no good reason it's just
05:23 - my magic glass look look at this magic
05:25 - glass it is a glass of water and it is
05:30 - no longer a glass of water ok lah
05:36 - Champloo rights I'll hello I'm here for
05:39 - the dancing lesson well the only thing I
05:41 - know I think dancing wise is the hand
05:43 - jive which is let's see if somebody
05:53 - wants to make a gift of that one
05:54 - somebody sent me a gift of something
05:55 - else and I posted and people seem to
05:57 - enjoy it okay uh so practice that and
06:01 - enjoy okay so um I'm going to look at p
06:06 - 5 GS instance mode so let me get myself
06:08 - set up for this I made myself a little
06:10 - bit bigger I don't know if you noticed I
06:12 - I'm only in the corner here you can see
06:14 - if I move my arms out here that's
06:16 - actually the camera only goes this high
06:18 - and it only goes over to hear it
06:20 - actually extends all the way this way so
06:21 - i can stand over here and i'm still
06:23 - sorry i really should probably have the
06:24 - laptop over here and move this light
06:27 - over a little bit hold on i'm
06:30 - rearranging realize the way this is it's
06:35 - better for me to be further over because
06:38 - I will block less better better better
06:42 - and the water can go here okay so this
06:46 - is weird because the camera it just like
06:48 - looks like it's not pointed at me at all
06:50 - but right now I'm looking straight at
06:52 - the camera I can't but have to look over
06:55 - here to see my previous screen anyway
06:56 - but i can type here and then i can point
06:59 - to overhear a gesture look at this stuff
07:00 - ok this is working so p 5 GS instance
07:03 - mode let's see if there's anything else
07:05 - that I wanted to do instead of that
07:07 - no no oh I did this um until so many
07:14 - things so many things these are going to
07:15 - be good but I gotta be this I'm excited
07:18 - about Chrome extensions that I missed
07:21 - that one somewhere here let's see if
07:23 - anybody has written any comments down at
07:24 - the bottom here no 15 days ago I've seen
07:27 - these ok so here we go instance mode
07:29 - you're going to do it ok as eight people
07:34 - watching ok so I'm going to minimize
07:40 - this I am here and the before we get to
07:44 - instance mode I'm going to just make a
07:49 - some code here so we have something to
07:53 - work with and let's do this
08:10 - and let's run this now we can say let's
08:14 - make that quite a bit bigger and and
08:23 - give us some alpha okay so there we go
08:27 - so this is we're going to be my sketch
08:29 - that I'm going to turn into instance
08:31 - mode will talk about why you might want
08:32 - to use instance mode and all that sort
08:34 - of things I'm going to wipe my glasses
08:39 - okay and just for fun up you know I'm
08:46 - going to do I'm going to take a minute
08:47 - here and I'm gonna look for my tape you
08:58 - know I need one of those I should just
08:59 - get a GoPro and put it on my head and
09:01 - then I could have that also be a feed to
09:03 - live stream and you guys could see me I
09:06 - don't know where that tape one I know
09:07 - it's fine I just won't trip over this
09:09 - wire today it's gonna be fine okay now
09:11 - I'm over here I'm talking to this camera
09:13 - does that work okay it's shaders on the
09:18 - list someone asks shaders is not
09:21 - currently with mostly because i'm not
09:24 - really a shaders kind of person but I I
09:27 - think that would be worth adding the
09:29 - list and taking a look at at some point
09:30 - in particular in the context of
09:32 - processing versus WebGL and that type of
09:34 - thing so I'm adding that's my mental
09:36 - list right now that my taking a while to
09:38 - get to that if you're looking for a good
09:40 - to learn shaders I'm in the wrong
09:43 - computer I do have a recommendation for
09:45 - you something called the book of shaders
09:50 - by Patricio I googled it and here it is
09:55 - the book of shaders this is come on
09:58 - internet refresh um this is a wonderful
10:02 - set of tutorials and materials about
10:04 - shaders and i would highly recommend it
10:06 - as a good place to get started and what
10:09 - i will do is i will read this learn it
10:12 - and then make some videos based on it
10:14 - inspired by it perhaps if I can get
10:16 - myself to know about shaders okay so
10:22 - that's that shaders
10:23 - close this minimize this and we're going
10:27 - to talk about instance mode okay oh
10:30 - absolutely poops okay put this back here
10:33 - checking the chat ok here we go 12
10:36 - people are here and I'm going to begin I
10:38 - feel ready I have a racer and have a
10:42 - whiteboard marker I have a glass of
10:44 - water and all I can do let's walk over
10:51 - here and hit a button and I wonder if I
10:53 - can do it like this so I could always
10:56 - edit out the beginning part hello I have
11:05 - space here now I'm walking back and
11:06 - forth um hello in this video I am going
11:09 - to talk about p5 jas instance mode what
11:13 - is p 5 GS instance mode why would you
11:16 - want to use it all of these strange
11:18 - questions will have an answer to them
11:21 - perhaps by the time we get for the end
11:23 - of this video I hope okay let's just see
11:25 - how this goes okay so first of all Here
11:27 - I am in a room with a screen behind me
11:30 - kind of and if i press command R and run
11:33 - this p 5 GS sketch I can move my mouse
11:36 - around and draw some nice purple circles
11:38 - so this is a p5 jazz sketch it has a
11:41 - setup it has a draw actually let me add
11:44 - something to this p 5 GS sketch let me
11:47 - add a variable X and what I'm going to
11:52 - do is I'm going to draw the ellipse at x
11:57 - and i'm going to say x equals x plus 5
11:59 - and if x is greater than with x equals 0
12:03 - so i'm going to do that and oh I'm going
12:05 - to save this as a instance mode now I'm
12:10 - going to run it so you can see now the
12:12 - circle is moving across the screen
12:14 - automatically but it moves with my Y
12:17 - position so this is a p5 j/s sketch I
12:22 - just start this whole video over because
12:25 - I'm kind of feel like I need to get into
12:29 - it a little bit faster and I'm like
12:33 - tired today
12:34 - I could do this I realize I want to have
12:41 - a global variable in this sketch so I'm
12:43 - going to change the way the sketch works
12:47 - and i'm going to say i'm going to change
12:59 - this sketch how much time do I have here
13:03 - 1247 I'm good if i run this okay so i'm
13:10 - just going to have the circle move
13:12 - randomly and let's say no stroke and
13:17 - give it even more alpha okay so this is
13:22 - my ghostly moving circle which kind of
13:29 - does this okay random walking circle ok
13:32 - so I'm going to start this over this is
13:34 - going to be the sketch and talk about p5
13:38 - Jess instance mode hello Juan Vargas
13:42 - just got here in time ok uh-huh here we
13:45 - go again hello in this video I'm going
13:51 - to talk about something called instance
13:53 - mode in terms of P 5ks this is also
13:56 - sometimes kind of referred to as name
13:58 - spacing is like all these terms I hope
14:03 - that okay last time last time last time
14:09 - 15 people are here I have to just like
14:12 - power through this even though I'm tired
14:14 - hungry there's a reason for making this
14:17 - video and we're going to do it hello in
14:22 - this video I'm going to talk about
14:23 - something called p5 j/s instance mode
14:26 - what is that why would you want to use
14:29 - it what's the point of that well okay so
14:32 - but my way this is also sometimes we're
14:35 - related or refer to as name spacing in
14:37 - JavaScript so what do I mean by name
14:39 - spacing instance mode that sort of thing
14:41 - so look at this ap 5j s sketch a single
14:44 - global variable X a function set up and
14:47 - a function draw
14:48 - I hit run and we see this nice purplish
14:51 - circle moving about kind of painting on
14:53 - the screen you know this is the kind of
14:55 - stuff we do every day in our lives make
14:58 - these little p5 sketches with these
14:59 - purple circles that type of thing so
15:02 - where might this deed more than just
15:08 - this instance mode why would you need
15:10 - instance mode okay so here's one
15:11 - scenario let's say I wanted to do this
15:15 - create can and let's make this canvas
15:17 - smaller 200 200 and let's make it what
15:21 - if I wanted to have two canvases in the
15:24 - window so when i run this sketch and i
15:26 - look at the browser page i would see
15:28 - somehow like two different canvases well
15:31 - clearly that doesn't work p5 jazz in its
15:34 - default global mode plain old regular
15:37 - way it's written you can't actually add
15:39 - two canvases to the page so this is one
15:42 - reason why you need instance mode here's
15:45 - another reason what if i were to say
15:49 - something like whoops uh VAR window
15:57 - equals hello oh wonder if this will
16:01 - break everything it's giving me a
16:03 - warning by the way let's run this okay
16:05 - so this happened to work but it's a
16:09 - little bit dangerous and let's see what
16:10 - the warning is right look at this
16:11 - redefinition of window so window is a
16:15 - very important key global variable that
16:18 - just exists in javascript in the browser
16:20 - it's a variable is referring to the
16:21 - window object this window that's the
16:24 - whole sort of like browser window itself
16:26 - but I want to have like a window
16:27 - variable in my p5 gfs sketch because i
16:30 - like the word window and it's what i
16:32 - want to name my variable this is a
16:34 - problem because i don't want to mess
16:37 - with the global name space so that
16:40 - sounds like a horrible thing global
16:42 - namespace and for the most part in your
16:43 - life I hope you don't have to worry
16:45 - about the global namespace but sometimes
16:47 - you do and in the way that you write p 5
16:50 - GS code saying function setup function
16:53 - draw VAR x all those things are global
16:55 - variables that exist across all of your
16:58 - javascript code so if you also
17:01 - incorporate
17:01 - other libraries like d3 or popcorn or
17:06 - some other thing that you might have
17:09 - variable names conflict with other
17:10 - things and this can be a problem so in
17:12 - essence name spacing is the act of
17:15 - saying all of the variables and things
17:18 - associated with my particular program
17:20 - are going to be under a particular name
17:22 - like I'm always going to say instead of
17:25 - var X I'm always going to say shipment x
17:27 - instead of our window I'm always going
17:29 - to say schiffman dot window so Schiffman
17:32 - dot window can never conflict with the
17:34 - global window because it isn't the
17:36 - global window it's Schiffman not window
17:38 - so these are the main two reasons if
17:40 - you're in some kind of complex scenario
17:43 - where namespacing having everything in
17:45 - your p5 sketch under a particular name
17:47 - becomes important to you or simply if
17:50 - you need more than one canvas on the
17:52 - screen on the screen in the window
17:55 - itself these are reasons why you need
17:57 - instance mode so hopefully that makes
17:58 - sense let's actually look at here's the
18:01 - thing though if you don't really need
18:02 - instance mode maybe you don't want
18:03 - instance mode because it's like a lot of
18:05 - extra code to write and it looks a
18:07 - little bit confusing but it is
18:08 - interesting and you might learn
18:10 - something you're still watching this
18:11 - video okay here we go so what I want to
18:14 - do is go back to this sketch just the
18:17 - way it was now where's the bottom of the
18:19 - editor window I'm zoomed in no wonder so
18:22 - let me move this back over here we look
18:24 - at where I'm standing next to the code
18:25 - great so the first thing I want to do is
18:27 - figure out how we're going to write the
18:30 - instance mode oh I was going to use the
18:31 - whiteboard I forget it add a new
18:34 - whiteboard I was going to use but this
18:36 - video doesn't really merit it I will see
18:38 - so basically what I what I want to do is
18:42 - I want to say something like this this
18:48 - is the idea of name spacing I want to
18:52 - create a actual object right this isn't
18:56 - p5 does this kind of magically for you
18:58 - you shouldn't be able to do what we just
19:00 - did just like write a setup function and
19:03 - somehow it magically gets triggered and
19:05 - write a draw function and somehow
19:06 - magically it looks p5 is written this
19:09 - way so that you can kind of get started
19:11 - quickly and behind the scenes it's like
19:12 - looking for a global setup function
19:14 - looking for a global draw function but
19:16 - ultimately what exists is like a p5
19:19 - object and I'm calling it my P thought
19:21 - excuse me I want to make a new p5 object
19:24 - and that new p5 object should have in it
19:27 - all of the variables associated with my
19:29 - sketch and all of the the all of the
19:36 - functions associated I sketch the set up
19:38 - the draw all that sort of stuff so this
19:42 - is the idea but now inside this thing
19:44 - called sketch I need to put all of the
19:47 - stuffs get should have X in it sketch
19:50 - should have set up in it etc etc so the
19:52 - way that I write this and it's going to
19:54 - look a little bit weird it's like this I
19:56 - want to now make a sketch variable which
19:59 - is a function like this so this is known
20:05 - as this is a function a function is
20:08 - called sketch the function takes an
20:10 - argument called p I could name that
20:13 - whatever I want maybe i'll call it p 5 I
20:16 - don't know let's just call it Pete I
20:19 - pause really let's look at no I'm just
20:23 - gonna look over here hon hai's a cheat
20:27 - sheet for a second I should have had
20:29 - this up oh my goodness edit this out of
20:32 - this video or loop the jeopardy music
20:35 - over i just want to see ya okay I'm
20:39 - doing this I'm doing this right I knew I
20:40 - was right so so I need to create it's
20:44 - actually the closure oh I shouldn't have
20:46 - said closure and ever say closure in a
20:48 - video to makes everybody very
20:49 - uncomfortable but I I do have some other
20:50 - videos about this thing called a
20:52 - JavaScript closure but the idea is that
20:53 - I have this function called sketch and
20:56 - I'm going to attach all of the things
21:00 - that are going to be part of this actual
21:01 - p5 sketch so i'm going to say p dot x
21:06 - equals up actually i'm going to say
21:09 - 'pete set up equals function and i'm
21:15 - going to say p draw equals function and
21:20 - now i can go and get this code and it
21:24 - can go in here but i need to say p
21:27 - create
21:28 - this px py p dot background you know
21:33 - what I'm going to do I'm going to pause
21:37 - I'm going to go BAM it hits top here for
21:40 - a second it was I'm going to go back
21:46 - because I lost my train of thought that
21:49 - I had to look something up I don't know
21:53 - why I'm in this like mode of like fixing
21:56 - my mistakes because mistakes sometimes
21:58 - or what make everything work but I'm
22:01 - just going back for a second okay maybe
22:11 - you guys have some questions that I are
22:12 - in the chat hopefully you can still hear
22:14 - me and see everything I'm going to take
22:20 - a look at the chat really briefly okay
22:27 - some people I people arrived people are
22:30 - saying nice things putting in nice
22:33 - little emojis into the chat thank you
22:37 - okay thanks all for the nice comments
22:40 - okay um I'm going to pick up from a
22:44 - certain point and splice it together
22:47 - okay so i don't remember the problems i
22:50 - don't remember anything that i did so i
22:52 - think i'm going to try to pick up from
22:58 - somewhere around the point where i was
23:01 - talking about what to put in sketch so
23:09 - so I'm going to try that
23:21 - an awkward edit probably just happened
23:23 - right now because i went off on a
23:25 - tangent and I stopped and I restarted so
23:27 - this will get edited together hello and
23:31 - but i believe i blast left off talking
23:34 - about the fact that i want to make this
23:36 - p5 object that holds everything it has
23:39 - my ex in it has my setup in it has my
23:41 - draw in it but whoa did this actually
23:47 - work yeah hold on a second everybody I'm
23:53 - going to do this one more time see
23:54 - here's the problem i know what i'm going
23:55 - to do brilliant my example had a flaw in
24:02 - it which was yeah i know sketch is not
24:06 - defined okay great and so hold on my
24:10 - silver court once or queries stop
24:15 - everything's going to be okay everybody
24:17 - I think I've got it now okay
24:30 - hi everybody people are saying hi in the
24:32 - chat very nice i mean the middle trying
24:34 - to pick a tutorial about b5 instance
24:36 - mode I've messed it up like 15 times but
24:38 - I think now I'm gonna now I'm kind of
24:41 - back okay do-do-do-do-do awkward edit
24:49 - just happened because I messed something
24:51 - up and went off on a tangent but I'm
24:52 - back now and the point where I left you
24:54 - was and I also made some changes in code
24:57 - the very slight you know pause look at
24:58 - it nothing important but the point where
25:01 - i am at is instead of having all of this
25:03 - stuff in the global namespace a global x
25:06 - a global why a global set up a global
25:08 - draw what I want is to smush everything
25:11 - inside of this object this new p5 object
25:15 - i'm making which i'm storing in a
25:17 - variable called my p5 so how do i do
25:20 - that well we see that there's this line
25:22 - of code that says my p 5 equals a new p5
25:24 - and then we're passing in this thing
25:26 - called sketch so sketch the variable
25:30 - sketch is actually going to serve
25:32 - essentially as the template the template
25:38 - for the thing that's actually going to
25:41 - run so I make a variable called sketch
25:43 - which is actually equals a function
25:44 - which is a little bit weird but this is
25:46 - just kind of how things when you don't
25:48 - know it's nothing should be a JavaScript
25:49 - it probably should just be a function
25:50 - it's actually this is a closure and I
25:53 - don't I mean just even saying that
25:54 - that's where I that's why I had to stop
25:56 - the video and start over so to go down
25:58 - that road but you can think of this
26:00 - function as the template for creating
26:03 - the p5 sketch so the line of code that
26:06 - says VAR my p 5 equals new p5 is
26:08 - actually making the p5 sketch causing it
26:10 - to run and this thing called sketches
26:12 - where i'm going to put in all the pieces
26:14 - so without I need both of these things
26:17 - without the template I can't have the
26:19 - sketch but I can't make a sketch without
26:21 - the template so let's look at how we do
26:23 - that so notice how this function takes
26:25 - an argument and I arbitrarily called it
26:27 - P because P is the thing that I'm going
26:30 - to attach all the stuff that's going to
26:32 - go in the sketch to i'm going to say p x
26:34 - equals 100 + p y equals 100 and then i'm
26:38 - going to say p dot set up equals
26:40 - function
26:43 - and i'm going to say p draw equals
26:45 - function so now this you can see i'm
26:48 - filling in a name spacing everything i'm
26:50 - putting everything under this variable P
26:53 - P dot said Eppie draw PX and then we can
26:56 - see what's the other stuff that goes and
26:58 - set up I can copy this and get it and I
27:02 - can say P create canvas and Pete p
27:06 - background I can zoom out a little bit I
27:08 - can go down here and get all this stuff
27:10 - that was in draw and I can delete all of
27:14 - this now I don't need any of this global
27:16 - stuff anymore and i can paste this all
27:18 - in hearing say p dot fill p dot stroke
27:21 - and pita lips and PX and py and PX i
27:28 - should make this in a song in p dot y +
27:31 - p dot randleman p dot random but i don't
27:33 - need to say p 10 because 10 is a number
27:36 - okay um and now I run this just work
27:41 - would I get wrong is there an error no
27:44 - air okay so hold on let's look at this
27:46 - this looks pretty good to me I love what
27:48 - I did is I created uh you know what I
27:52 - wonder if this actually needs to be
27:57 - below yeah uncaught reference air so so
28:00 - interestingly enough i joined I felt
28:02 - like muttering under my breath a mistake
28:04 - that I made but I need to declare the
28:06 - template first and fill everything in
28:08 - before I can actually make that p5
28:10 - object now I did get an error uncut
28:11 - reference our X is not defined line 14
28:14 - look at that x and y are no longer
28:17 - global variables their name spaced under
28:19 - this thing called p PX py and there we
28:24 - go now we have our sketch and I i wish
28:26 - this sketch wasn't so long i can remove
28:29 - a few line breaks here just so you can
28:30 - kind of see it all on this one page but
28:33 - you can see now here's the template for
28:35 - the sketch everything namespace and now
28:37 - i'm creating that sketch now there's
28:40 - some interesting things going on here
28:42 - for example what if i were to do
28:45 - something totally insane but what
28:48 - outside of this what if i were to say
28:51 - set timeout this is a javascript
28:53 - function by the way a javascript
28:55 - function that allows you to
28:56 - do what at trigger event like I'm going
29:00 - to reset background I'm off on a little
29:06 - bit of a tangent here but that's okay
29:07 - and do that in three seconds three
29:09 - thousand milliseconds then I'm going to
29:11 - define that function reset background
29:13 - and in that function i'm going to say my
29:17 - p5 dot background to fifth 51 so look at
29:23 - this that sketch that p5 sketch is now
29:27 - inside of this object my p5 so elsewhere
29:30 - in the code right this is how I might
29:32 - use p5 in connection with another
29:34 - library if I'm in some other piece of
29:36 - code that's completely outside of the
29:38 - whole set of a drawing p5 thing I can
29:40 - reference that sketch call functions on
29:42 - it executes variables in it by saying my
29:44 - p5 so if I same IP five dot X I'm
29:47 - talking about this particular X up here
29:50 - but remember in the template
29:52 - everything's getting attached to P which
29:54 - gets put into sketch and sketch then
29:57 - gets made into my p5 and after the fact
30:00 - now everything associated with that
30:01 - sketch is in the variable might be five
30:03 - so let's see if this works and I can run
30:05 - this we can count to three one
30:07 - one-thousand two one-thousand three
30:08 - one-thousand right and if I change this
30:11 - to set interval we can say one
30:14 - one-thousand two one-thousand three
30:15 - one-thousand background one one-thousand
30:17 - two one-thousand three one-thousand
30:19 - background one one thousand oh the thing
30:21 - went off you know what I should do is I
30:23 - should also say my p 5 X is in the
30:27 - middle now look at this my p5 dot y now
30:30 - look at this what's wrong with this
30:32 - something is horribly wrong you're not
30:34 - horribly wrong here right remember
30:36 - everything is namespace width and height
30:37 - don't exist in the global world so I
30:40 - need to say my p5 dot with my p5 height
30:44 - and I can run this now one one-thousand
30:47 - two one-thousand three one-thousand one
30:49 - one-thousand two one-thousand three
30:50 - one-thousand okay so you can see that
30:53 - this works and it's kind of a nice thing
30:55 - that you've got and you know it's hard
30:57 - to see on that camera went off but I'm
30:58 - going to turn it back on targets might
31:00 - be a little bit harder to see the the
31:02 - value here just in this sort of like
31:03 - trivial example but you could imagine if
31:05 - you've got a lot of code this could be
31:07 - useful but one more thing let's do
31:09 - before
31:09 - go in this video which is probably about
31:11 - 12 minutes so far is let's look at how
31:14 - this can allow you to have two canvases
31:16 - on the same page so what uh so let's
31:20 - look at that so one thing I could do is
31:21 - I could rename this to sketch one
31:24 - actually insanely here's something
31:27 - that's kind of in st. before I even do
31:28 - that let's call this my p-51 and let's
31:31 - just do this my p5 to look at this and
31:34 - I'm gonna run this look at that too on
31:37 - the page operate so i could just
31:38 - duplicate that sketch by the way without
31:40 - oops and you know only one of them let's
31:44 - do this does reset background thing so i
31:50 - duplicate that sketch but notice only
31:52 - one of them is getting its background
31:54 - reset because i'm only referring to that
31:55 - what i'm after you're following because
31:56 - i just like i'm thinking of this weird
31:58 - stuff on the fly but this is actually
31:59 - kind of great about instance mode I made
32:01 - this template for a sketch
32:03 - object-oriented programming hello I made
32:05 - this template for the sketch right and
32:07 - then I'm baking copies of it and I don't
32:10 - have to rewrite that code i could just
32:11 - duplicate it and we could write this in
32:13 - a loop it suddenly have hundreds of
32:14 - these on the page all the separate
32:15 - canvases but you'll notice that i could
32:18 - also say i could call this sketch one
32:20 - and i could call this sketch too and I
32:28 - could I'm gonna do something totally
32:30 - uninteresting here which is just
32:32 - basically have it be the same sketch but
32:34 - with a different color and you can see
32:37 - now I have two sketches two canvases on
32:40 - the same page I can refer to them as my
32:43 - p-51 I don't like my name's here my p-51
32:48 - in somewhere else so what instance mode
32:52 - allows you to do is take all the stuff
32:54 - that you would normally write globally
32:56 - and put it inside of this like function
32:59 - this closure function this function that
33:01 - and attach everything to this variable p
33:04 - PX py p dot Senate pedro then you have
33:06 - this template for making versions of
33:09 - that sketch that will appear on the page
33:10 - and you can control whether they get
33:12 - made yes or no so hopefully this makes
33:15 - sense to you and as you might find this
33:17 - useful in different scenarios where you
33:19 - need it i'm often saying like oh
33:22 - I think you need instant smoked and now
33:24 - I can point people to this video um and
33:26 - so ask your questions in the comments of
33:29 - trying if you make something like you
33:30 - know you're looking to do some kind of
33:31 - weird experiment maybe like fill the
33:33 - screen with a hundred copies of the same
33:35 - sketch and see what happens that way and
33:37 - also you know what happens when you
33:39 - start integrating the Dom library with
33:40 - this stuff that's kind of interesting to
33:42 - think about using p5 in conjunction with
33:44 - another library namespacing if try this
33:46 - stuff out if you do anything I share it
33:48 - in the comments below and I look forward
33:50 - to seeing you in another video in the
33:52 - future ok everyone yeah everyone so some
34:05 - people have joined so the reason why the
34:06 - email alerts to go through is because I
34:09 - you know I somehow I violated male
34:11 - chimps policy and I have a feeling now
34:15 - that you can't sign up either so let me
34:17 - let me see I'm gonna have to fix this
34:18 - let me go to so one thing I did is
34:22 - whoops ignore this if i go to Schiffman
34:25 - net and make this a little bit bigger
34:30 - there's a place where I could like sign
34:33 - up let's see if this works yeah it's I
34:42 - have a feeling that mail chimp is now
34:45 - shut me down so I'm gonna have to fix
34:46 - that somehow oh well but I'm as soon as
34:49 - I get back to my computer and off making
34:51 - these videos i will do that but i'm
34:55 - happy to take some questions I for the
34:58 - next 10 or 15 minutes if there's anybody
35:00 - in the chat with questions maybe I'll
35:03 - quickly post to twitter that i'll be
35:06 - live for 10 more Oh somebody actually
35:10 - wrote a question on Twitter hello is it
35:15 - this comes from at KU who Alan hello is
35:17 - it possible to have color map and color
35:20 - bar in processing or I have to draw an
35:23 - image in overlay text from scratch not
35:26 - sure I entirely understand that question
35:28 - so possible have color map and color bar
35:31 - in processing or I have to draw an image
35:33 - and overlay text
35:35 - scratch I think maybe the question is
35:39 - asking if you can have like a color
35:41 - picker in processing and there's no
35:44 - automatic way to do that you know I'm
35:47 - kind of quickly launching processing
35:49 - here is it open in other words all
35:53 - processing does is create a window you
35:57 - know you write some code it launches the
36:00 - window you don't really get anything for
36:01 - free that you can put gooey stuff that
36:04 - sort of thing however somebody could
36:06 - easily write a library for processing
36:08 - that allows you to have that I don't
36:09 - know that one exists for a color picker
36:10 - there is actually a color picker which
36:12 - is part of the interface itself under
36:15 - here color selector so you actually can
36:18 - use this as this this is not something
36:20 - that's launching as part of your code or
36:21 - your program but if you're looking for a
36:23 - quick way to pick colors and see RGB
36:25 - values inside processing that does exist
36:27 - alright that was a question let's see if
36:30 - there are any other questions ah so
36:40 - could you demo a restart reset button to
36:43 - restart the p5 sketch great question
36:47 - from an HTML button ok ok ok a hold on
36:53 - oh there's a bunch of there's a bunch of
36:54 - questions here which are good so let me
36:55 - get to all of them the the reset button
36:57 - is a bit of a longer one I'll actually
36:58 - make that into a video I could probably
37:00 - just take five or ten minutes and I want
37:02 - to save that as its own chunk leeandra
37:04 - asks can you show the code output again
37:06 - please so this is this i will post this
37:12 - code will get posted on github and
37:15 - linked from the video description as
37:17 - soon as i get to that later today do p5
37:23 - objects have a default constructor I
37:26 - think what you're meaning what you're
37:29 - what you're asking is if you said
37:31 - something like this something like that
37:36 - will any what will happen so you can see
37:40 - actually something did happen it
37:42 - probably put an empty 100 by 100 canvas
37:45 - just right here so there is apparently a
37:47 - default constructor it will do
37:48 - something but nothing happens at all in
37:50 - it which is interesting to see so you
37:52 - can I made a p5 sketch it just doesn't
37:54 - have any code associated with it is
37:59 - multiple canvases very different than
38:01 - using create graphics that's a great
38:03 - question so it's very similar
38:07 - conceptually it's exactly the same idea
38:10 - but create graphics does not actually
38:12 - create a Dom element canvas that's
38:15 - viewable that's associated with a set up
38:17 - in a draw so I'm having trouble
38:20 - answering this because I can barely
38:21 - understand it myself but mult a create
38:25 - graphics makes a canvas create canvas
38:28 - makes a canvas but create canvas is like
38:30 - a special p5 function that makes a
38:32 - canvas that's associated with a set up
38:34 - in a draw whereas create graphics just
38:36 - makes the canvas element itself so if
38:38 - you want a canvas that you can kind of
38:39 - control on the p5 way you've got to use
38:41 - create canvas multiple ones you've got
38:43 - to use instance mode but you can make
38:46 - multiple canvases that you're kind of
38:49 - controlling and manipulating in your own
38:50 - special way simply with kreeya graphics
38:52 - does that make sense hopefully that
38:54 - makes sense ok so both XP asks could you
39:00 - demo a reset button from an HTML button
39:02 - to restart a p5 sketch and this is a
39:04 - great question so I'm going to let me
39:07 - get myself prepared here and let's think
39:10 - about let me go let me actually open up
39:12 - an example and I'm hesitate to do the
39:16 - flocking one because it's so got so much
39:18 - involved but let's let me open up the
39:19 - flocking one and yeah this will work
39:24 - because of when I hit reset that I want
39:27 - this stuff to start over again from the
39:29 - beginning okay and I want to make an
39:32 - HTML button okay and let me just see
39:36 - here Dom libraries included okay so I'm
39:40 - going to do this I'm going to take out
39:43 - some of these comments that are overly
39:45 - long what else oh yeah oh this is always
39:49 - one that's interesting where is there I
39:53 - just want to bothers me that the
39:57 - scrolling is an issue
40:01 - well there's nothing I can do about that
40:03 - and i right this is silly what I'm doing
40:07 - sorry everybody I was trying to make it
40:08 - so it wouldn't scroll left and right but
40:10 - there's really no way around that you
40:11 - know what I'm going to do is I'm going
40:12 - to take all of this and put it in a
40:17 - flock jas sorry I'm just preparing this
40:20 - example and here flock Jan so there's
40:26 - less code why is it doing that come on
40:30 - Oh p5 editor how you torture me save
40:39 - that's weird all right fine oh because
40:41 - it's in the it's the examples flocking
40:46 - okay great sorry sorry everybody
40:56 - and let's see here and i'm going to do
40:59 - i'm doing silly things that are totally
41:02 - unnecessary to get ready to answer this
41:04 - question okay so what I'm going to do
41:07 - now is look at I'm going to leave this
41:10 - sketch with no comments simple sketch
41:18 - I'm going to look at how we add a button
41:21 - to this sketch and whenever you click
41:23 - the button the sketch restarts okay now
41:28 - incidentally I'm not going to mention
41:29 - this in the video but incidentally if i
41:32 - was using instance mode I could just
41:33 - like kill that object to maybe remake it
41:36 - but I don't think that's really a good
41:37 - way of doing it so I'm going to do it a
41:38 - different way in this video there's some
41:42 - other questions that people are asking
41:44 - i'll come back to them after i do this
41:46 - ok so here we go this is a great
41:49 - question
41:58 - hello in this video I'm the wall
42:01 - scratched in a weird way okay hi a
42:06 - question just came in in the live chat
42:08 - how do you create an HTML button that
42:11 - when you press that button your p5
42:13 - sketch or restarts itself so I'm going
42:15 - to look very quickly at how to do that
42:17 - in this particular video so I have one
42:20 - of the p5 examples called flocking it's
42:23 - running a flocking simulation there's a
42:24 - lot of code involved with this but we
42:26 - can see that actually what's in setup
42:28 - and draw is quite simple and mostly all
42:30 - the code is happening in other objects
42:32 - how that works is not really the
42:33 - contents of this video I want to look at
42:35 - how we're going to have the sketch
42:36 - restart with a button so first of all
42:39 - let's at least look how do we add the
42:41 - button to this page so the way that you
42:42 - can add a button in a p5 sketch is using
42:45 - the p5 Dom library and you want to make
42:47 - sure that your you've got the Dom
42:49 - library included if you're using this
42:51 - desktop editor which by the time you
42:52 - watch this video might be completely
42:54 - different or obsolete but the main thing
42:56 - here is you want to make sure in your
42:57 - index.html file that you're referencing
43:00 - the p5 Dom library which I am here as
43:03 - well because I'm going to the button is
43:04 - not part of just the plain vanilla p5
43:07 - library so that's already set for me and
43:09 - as soon as that's true i can say create
43:11 - button and i'll pass a single argument
43:15 - to that function reset so now if i run
43:18 - the sketch you can see oh you can see
43:21 - here i'm gonna shrink this down a little
43:24 - bit there we go you can see all the way
43:26 - here at the bottom there's a button that
43:27 - says reset now of course if I were to
43:31 - click this button nothing's going to
43:33 - happen because I haven't actually
43:34 - attached any event to it so I need to
43:37 - attach an event to that button the way
43:39 - that I attach an event to that button is
43:41 - first of all I need a variable to store
43:43 - a reference to that button so that i can
43:46 - say button dot mouse press reset sketch
43:53 - so what i want to do is that this
43:58 - particular button that's on the page
44:00 - when i press that button i want to
44:03 - execute a function called reset sketch
44:05 - which will somehow reset the sketch now
44:07 - reset sketch isn't some function that
44:09 - exists as part of p5 it's a name
44:11 - that I just made up because I'm gonna
44:12 - write it now your instinct might be to
44:14 - do this just call setup setup as a
44:18 - function whenever I press the button
44:20 - call setup again let's try that let's
44:22 - save our code we might and let's see
44:24 - what happens now weirdly that work but
44:26 - look what's happening like a more
44:29 - buttons are being added all sorts of
44:30 - things are happening right because
44:32 - everything create canvas was called
44:34 - again which is a little bit of a problem
44:36 - so this is a bad idea I don't even
44:39 - though this kind of worked I don't want
44:41 - to tie the setup function to a
44:43 - particular event which is why i said i
44:45 - want to make my own function called
44:47 - reset sketch so what does that mean i
44:51 - need to then write a function called
44:53 - reset sketch and in this function is
44:55 - where I want to put all the code that
44:57 - should happen when a sketch is restarted
45:00 - so you might be gathering now watching
45:02 - this video realizing oh there's not a
45:04 - way to just do this automatically and I
45:06 - would think there really isn't it's up
45:07 - to you to kind of define what it means
45:09 - to reset a sketch and then execute that
45:12 - code at the appropriate time the good
45:14 - news for you is I could say you know
45:16 - what I think it means to reset a sketch
45:17 - I think it means only to do this stuff
45:19 - it means to make a new flock object and
45:21 - to add a hundred voids to that flock
45:24 - object so I can take that code and put
45:27 - it into reset sketch and you know what I
45:29 - can do even better than that I don't
45:31 - need you your instinct might have been
45:33 - to do this oops to take that code and
45:35 - copy it in there and now this is
45:37 - actually good right you see the sketch
45:39 - is running I hit the button every time I
45:41 - hit the button it's resetting the sketch
45:43 - so you could say that we're done but I
45:46 - don't like this I just duplicated this
45:47 - entire block of code down here in this
45:49 - function and what if i want to change
45:51 - what's happening when I reset the sketch
45:54 - but also have that happen in setup well
45:55 - the fact that i made this resets sketch
45:57 - function means i can also call it and
45:59 - set up so basically now if we look at
46:02 - setups code this is wonderful what I
46:04 - what setup does is it basically says
46:06 - create a canvas set up the sketch and by
46:09 - the way make a button that if you ever
46:11 - press that button set up the sketch
46:12 - again so basically everything associated
46:15 - with starting the sketch is in reset
46:17 - sketch except for making the canvas
46:19 - which I really only want to do once and
46:20 - making the reset button which I really
46:22 - only want to do one
46:23 - so now if i run this sketch we can see
46:26 - there it is flocking and if i hit reset
46:28 - every time I hit that button it resets
46:31 - the sketch and this my friends is a less
46:34 - than five minute tutorial video and I'm
46:36 - so tempted to keep talking but lest i go
46:39 - over five minutes I'm gonna hit stop so
46:40 - hopefully you found this useful if you
46:42 - make your own button or something that
46:43 - resets a sketch let me know and share it
46:45 - in the comments or ask questions or
46:47 - comments and I will get back to you and
46:48 - this code will also the code the code
46:49 - for this get form is for guys the code
46:51 - for the sketch will also be posted to
46:52 - github and a link will be in the
46:54 - description goodbye ok let's see ok so
47:00 - I'm going to go back and look at some of
47:02 - the questions I don't know what I do
47:03 - with my phone here it is because I'm
47:04 - just checking to see if I have any
47:06 - important messages which it doesn't look
47:07 - like i do it's 120 ok so let me look at
47:10 - some of these questions oh la shop floor
47:14 - ask so really great question uh-oh you
47:19 - know what let me add that I'll tack it
47:20 - on to the end that was a great question
47:23 - because frame count didn't get reset mmm
47:29 - let's see if we can fix that ok oh ok
47:35 - when hit record so much for my short
47:39 - video a question came up in the chat
47:41 - which i think is an important one which
47:43 - is what about frame count so let's look
47:46 - at this so what I'm going to do is I'm
47:48 - going to also create a paragraph create
47:59 - p and i'm going to put the words frame
48:03 - count in it and i'm also going to say i
48:08 - want it to appear kind of large
48:15 - so if i run the sketch now oops that's
48:18 - way too large you can see here I've got
48:23 - frame count here so what I want to do
48:24 - now in draw is say text HTML the actual
48:34 - frame count variable let's see so you
48:38 - can see now you can see a problem with
48:41 - my brilliant solution which is that as
48:43 - the sketch is running the frame count is
48:46 - going up and up and up and if I hit
48:47 - reset that frame count did not reset
48:50 - right because i didn't really restart p
48:53 - 5 as a whole i just restarted all the
48:55 - stuff for my sketch so global things in
48:58 - p5 are continuing however I have a
49:00 - feeling that we can actually just you
49:03 - know over right frame count and p5 will
49:07 - just be like that's fine you take care
49:08 - of it if you want so if i do that and
49:11 - run it and then hit reset nut didn't
49:13 - work uh-huh right it doesn't because
49:21 - it's probably keeping track of it
49:23 - somewhere else in a different variable
49:25 - oh boy okay pause video actually we keep
49:29 - recording video maybe this will be a
49:31 - separate I don't know what to do okay
49:33 - well let's figure this out let me see if
49:34 - there's some other questions here and
49:38 - i'm going to show you guys how to how to
49:39 - determine what the answer this is but
49:41 - i'll keep going i'll get to those other
49:42 - questions later so what we need to do is
49:44 - look in the p5 actual source code so i'm
49:48 - looking in the p5 source code and i'm
49:50 - going to look for anywhere frame count
49:51 - is mentioned it's in all so much of the
49:55 - documentation that's so unfortunate
49:58 - setproperty frame count this frame count
50:01 - plus one this happens in the draw
50:09 - function during the loop so i'm looking
50:13 - and like is there different like this
50:15 - this dot setproperty let's look for that
50:20 - function this property window if its
50:23 - global window dot property so i wonder
50:26 - if i do something like
50:31 - this dot frame count no our window dot
50:36 - frame count weird right because oh
50:41 - because what am I missing here because
50:47 - prop value window prop buying this this
50:57 - stuff ring count plus one I don't know
50:59 - how to get it's weird that I'm not able
51:00 - to get access to that variable all right
51:05 - hold on let's look for other places
51:08 - there must be some other that's the
51:10 - really where is it uh-huh where does it
51:15 - get its first value zero so I'm stumped
51:20 - here maybe somebody in the chat I'm
51:24 - going to have to I'm gonna have to go
51:26 - look this up I'm gonna have to look at
51:28 - this later something that chap might
51:29 - have an idea i'm gonna answer some other
51:30 - questions Oh somebody else okay so okay
51:36 - so can a p5 objects set up then draw
51:39 - function be modified once it has been
51:41 - created yes it can however note that
51:45 - setup will never get executed again so
51:48 - if you modify the p5 sketch object setup
51:50 - function later it's that's not going to
51:53 - make any difference but if you modify
51:54 - the draw function while draws being
51:56 - called continuously that new draw
51:58 - function will be executed that's
52:00 - probably a question related back to the
52:02 - video i made previously about about
52:06 - instance mode ok any thoughts on the ITP
52:11 - camp in june will you be in attendance
52:13 - ok so somebody asks ITP camp so i'm just
52:19 - going to go there ITP that nyu edu slash
52:22 - camp there is a four-week program at ITP
52:27 - you can look at the information about it
52:30 - read about it it's a fun interesting
52:33 - program to meet people do some
52:35 - interesting projects it's you know one
52:39 - university unconference type of style
52:41 - thing
52:42 - so I do recommend it I think it's a
52:44 - great experience I have to say that I
52:46 - don't know that i'll be around it that
52:47 - off in this particular summer so but i
52:51 - would encourage you if you're interested
52:54 - in more stuff with creative code and
52:59 - then taking a look at it and I was not a
53:02 - very good answer this question okay is
53:07 - it looking at the time the sketch ran
53:10 - and computed from there with the problem
53:13 - yeah you know I don't think it is
53:14 - because if i look at the p5 if I again
53:17 - if i look at it's just incrementing the
53:23 - current frame count and adding one to it
53:25 - like it's going so let me comment this
53:27 - out right I'm actually modifying the p5
53:30 - source code right now if I comment that
53:32 - out and run my sketch you can see that
53:36 - it's not going up now what if I what if
53:44 - I in draw say this it is going up and
53:51 - then what if I do this well that was
53:55 - that now I'm able to override it but so
53:58 - basically this answer is kind of like
53:59 - just make your own variable that's so
54:07 - here's an interesting question though
54:08 - what happens if I put that back in and
54:12 - increment it is it going up by two I
54:14 - can't tell let's make the frame rate
54:17 - slower to 30 it did it once it did it
54:28 - like the first time through draw boy I'm
54:30 - really stumped with this one I've Lauren
54:32 - McCarthy word we're here I'm sure she
54:34 - would know the answer to it instantly
54:35 - but um I'm gonna look at this and get
54:39 - back to you live stream viewers really
54:44 - thinking about this because if i look at
54:47 - the implementation this is the thing
54:49 - that's doing it this is the same
54:50 - variable right if I say console dot
54:55 - log this dot frame count oh you know
55:03 - it's not I guess this console log
55:05 - doesn't show up here epsilon hmm I don't
55:11 - know I don't know what to say there's
55:13 - obviously something that I missing and
55:19 - it probably has to do with this okay
55:24 - hold on a sec let's leave this here and
55:29 - what this will cause other problems yeah
55:34 - I'll find this okay I'm stumped I'm
55:37 - gonna have to look at this later let me
55:38 - see if there's any other questions all
55:41 - right it's yeah so so I mean the guy
55:43 - went down a bit of a rabbit hole yer the
55:45 - truth of the matter is it's not that big
55:47 - of a deal because if I really want to
55:48 - solve this problem here's what I would
55:50 - choose to do I would just make up my own
55:52 - variable called frame counter I would
55:55 - set it equal to 0 i would say frame
55:59 - counter equals zero in reset sketch and
56:02 - then at the very very end i would say
56:05 - frame counter plus plus so now you can
56:08 - see oh and i can take this out and this
56:11 - can just start as 0 and if I run this
56:14 - you can see now whoa oh oh right this
56:17 - has to say frame counter and now you can
56:19 - see that every time we hit the reset
56:21 - button that will also restart so I think
56:23 - the answer in this case is if you really
56:25 - need that reset button you might just be
56:26 - better off kind of making up your own
56:28 - variable not using a p5 global wealth i
56:30 - think i got i got like three extra gray
56:32 - hairs during that little sequence right
56:34 - here okay I will I'm going to do a
56:38 - little whatever for five minutes while
56:42 - see if anybody has any last questions
56:44 - I'm just over here looking to see to
56:48 - make sure everything recorded properly
56:49 - and i will wait a little bit to see if
56:52 - there's any last questions in the chat
57:02 - 616 anyway so I made a tutorial today
57:06 - and we look at all of these let's copy
57:13 - these over oops ah sorry I'm copying
57:22 - some videos and copying these over let's
57:34 - see if this works
57:40 - who know too much too much
57:52 - that's from the other day
57:58 - that's from the other day whoops sorry
58:11 - everybody I'm gonna check the chat a
58:15 - second see what questions there are okay
58:18 - I think I'm good now for the videos are
58:23 - recorded okay what's the next video
58:26 - topic well I'm done for today
58:28 - unfortunately so for the next video
58:31 - topic but let's go to talk about what I
58:33 - hope to do so I had um you know what I
58:39 - need to do for a second where I'm lost
58:41 - oh I lost my preview that's why I need
58:44 - to I just need to record something with
58:46 - the whiteboard just so I can see what it
58:48 - looks like later because next week i'm
58:53 - hoping to get to the things that I'm
58:55 - hoping to do is make chrome extension
58:58 - three big things i want to do is make a
59:00 - whole set of videos on how to make a
59:01 - chrome extension I want to make a whole
59:04 - set of videos about git and github and
59:06 - then I want to return back to the
59:08 - connect and computer vision stuff and
59:09 - make more of those and in terms of I
59:12 - just I did the p5 instance mode and then
59:15 - there's some other little ones that I
59:16 - might like to do at some point but
59:17 - that's what I'm hoping to do at this
59:19 - point probably next week I might have a
59:21 - chance to make a video or two tomorrow
59:22 - but what I want to do before I go is I'm
59:25 - gonna hit record and I come over here
59:31 - whoops this camera is off I'm just want
59:35 - to see how this looks so pretend I'm
59:37 - talking to you which I actually am and
59:39 - i'm using this whiteboard marker and i'm
59:42 - going to say something like function
59:44 - yeah there's too many shadows i don't
59:46 - think i have the lighting good here
59:48 - function setup function draw we went to
59:53 - wrap these up in 2 p-5 instance mode and
59:58 - maybe there will be a scary creature it
60:03 - was actually really friendly with
60:05 - rainbows
60:06 - and a unicorn no smiling ok and then if
60:12 - I draw down here is this too low and if
60:15 - I walk over here and I talked to the
60:16 - camera and gesture over here I'm gonna
60:18 - see what take a look this looks like you
60:19 - guys can tell me was that sort of
60:20 - legible the letting this there's like
60:22 - kind of bad shadow up here because I'd
60:24 - these lights up above but there's a big
60:25 - bar pipe in here so it's causing a bit
60:28 - of a shadow plus I have this light down
60:29 - here which was for the green screen
60:31 - which is shadowing me turn this off for
60:33 - a second this better still I don't know
60:37 - if this is better turn that light off
60:40 - turn this light on I don't know it's
60:44 - brighter down here you can see you maybe
60:45 - I need another one over here I just need
60:46 - more lights I think ok but that was good
60:50 - ok check the job and hit stopped because
60:52 - I want to take a look at this video
60:53 - later to see what it looked like put
60:57 - that in here Oh keep both ok ups that
61:03 - camera went off the cameras these gamers
61:06 - shut off after 30 minutes which I
61:08 - actually could fix but ok p5 sketches
61:16 - with express can you show how to make it
61:18 - work real quick well I don't so there's
61:22 - not really I would I'm not a little
61:24 - confused by that question I'm probably
61:26 - just an understanding something but
61:28 - basically a P thought p5 is a
61:31 - client-side library only so what you
61:34 - could do is host your HTML javascript
61:38 - files with annex node Express app and
61:41 - actually I do this only make sure let me
61:44 - see if this is on my list because I do
61:46 - I'd made some node if I go to the I made
61:50 - a kind of basics of node video for the
61:53 - Twitter bot stuff but i think i should
61:56 - do i should add a somewhere here i
62:03 - should add a little bit there's more
62:07 - stuff that i think in terms of where
62:09 - have am i missing this where's the
62:10 - twitter bot one here it is node + p 5
62:18 - serve p 5 sketch do the you know proxy
62:26 - data query is something you might want
62:29 - to do as well as save to a file database
62:33 - so these are some things that I do want
62:35 - to make videos about actually at some
62:38 - point which is that there's certain
62:41 - things that you can't do client-side
62:42 - like save data to a server you can do
62:45 - that on you know you use a Google
62:47 - spreadsheet actually from the client
62:49 - side or use a if you used to be this
62:51 - thing called parse but that since been
62:52 - shut down and someone I believe firebase
62:54 - a student and I TP gave me a
62:56 - recommendation to look at firebase so
62:58 - there are but there are certain things
62:59 - you might want to do if you use node as
63:01 - your server programming with p5 as your
63:03 - client programming all my videos have
63:05 - pretty much just been only client
63:07 - programming the server stuff is actually
63:08 - happening because of the p5 editor or
63:11 - wherever you're uploading your sketches
63:12 - there's just happens to be a server
63:13 - there already but if you want to program
63:15 - your own server there is some
63:17 - interesting things you can do and I do
63:20 - have notes about this in I go to a
63:24 - shipment github I 08 so here I do have
63:29 - some examples but this is a course that
63:31 - I taught last fall somewhere in here
63:34 - note under node may be a note in api's
63:38 - week 11 I believe that I have some more
63:41 - stuff about a using node in connection
63:44 - with and so I want to make some video
63:46 - tutorials about that so I will that's a
63:48 - good thing to add to my list boy not
63:50 - enough to um you know I'm going to be
63:51 - doing this all the way through the
63:52 - summer so hopefully I'll get to all this
63:53 - stuff okay so thank you everyone for
63:57 - tuning in today I'm going to upload
63:59 - those videos the instance mode video and
64:02 - the reset in the p 5 GS sketch with a
64:05 - button video I'll be back next week
64:08 - making more give me some feedback either
64:12 - on Twitter or something or email or in
64:15 - the comments of how this whiteboard
64:16 - thing looked because I'm anybody it's a
64:20 - lighting expert and want to offer some
64:22 - help particular if you're like an ITP
64:24 - students didn't have to be watching this
64:26 - i'll be at ITP for a little bit tomorrow
64:28 - maybe you can
64:30 - do about it ok I'm going to I'm going to
64:33 - sign off down and hit this button and
64:34 - sign off ok see you later everybody

Cleaned transcript:

hello I think I am broadcasting live now welcome my name is Dan I have been spending about an hour trying to set up some lights in here and I'm looking at myself and I feel like I look a little bit reddish orange ish and then if I come over here to this camera view I look much paler so I still think I need to do some white balance work but if you are watching this live I don't know if anybody actually is please let me know in the chat if you can hear me okay if you can see me okay if the font and code is legible here and in particular if you can kind of read and see what's on the white board over here have a new white board and I that camera just went off I'm going to turn that back on one of these days I will begin these video streams without simply saying i'm testing but I'm still sort of in that process and I think next week I'm going to really be hitting the ground running although i think i'd still need got some lighting camera stuff that I've got to improve in here still ok are you there I'm gonna go check the chat everything ok says one person which is very nice to hear I've got three people watching I sent out an email announcement oops I'm going to check this computer here and looks pretty decent I'm going to check my ok and uh oh uh oh look at this ok so i signed up for mailchimp in order to take people's email addresses to send out email announcements when i go live and i wrote a quick email is about one sentence with the link to youtube live and it says here i got a message for mailchimp back that says our automated abuse prevention system omnivore reviewed your account it detected content or actions with either conflict with our acceptable use policy or present a significant risks to our deliverability your account has been disabled you may login at any time to export and back up your account data download reports or close the account permanently so I i guess i sent it i just do it quickly i made it plain text and i pasted a link to youtube maybe that's somehow not something I'm supposed to do I have to look at that later so no one got that announcement yeah the so I only have four people watching currently live which is just fine because I'm kind of today is the kind of extra this plan makes a very strange sound no I pick that up I didn't really eat a very big breakfast and I haven't had lunch since 1230 what I have somewhere I have to go about onethirty so I'm just going to give this a whirl and what I want to do is at least kind of try out my new white board I'm going to erase this and I'm going to go to my list of topics which is over here and I thought something that has been requested quite a few times is a p5 GS instance mode which is something you need if you want to namespace your javascript thing or if you want to you know have multiple canvases on a single page so i thought that might be a good topic just as kind of a oneoff make a 10 to 15 minute tutorial about writing a sketch in p5 j/s instance modes that's what I plan to do I'm also happy here to enter any just general questions about processing or p5 whip up an example on the fly based on somebody's questions so you can ask those in the chat how's everybody doing here oh it's just me okay um alright so I'm think I'm gonna get started I should have gotten some water if you don't mind I'm gonna go get a glass of water and I'll be right back you will still be able to hear me because I have a wireless mic as I go and get water but I'll be right back talk amongst yourselves in the chat and I'll be right back let's get glass of water here I come back I'm coming back I have a turn it really should tape down the wires on the floor because there's a wire right there I could easily just drip over it but I'll do that another day ok let me check the chat I've got six people seven people people are joining so I've got to like stalling a little bit for no good reason it's just my magic glass look look at this magic glass it is a glass of water and it is no longer a glass of water ok lah Champloo rights I'll hello I'm here for the dancing lesson well the only thing I know I think dancing wise is the hand jive which is let's see if somebody wants to make a gift of that one somebody sent me a gift of something else and I posted and people seem to enjoy it okay uh so practice that and enjoy okay so um I'm going to look at p 5 GS instance mode so let me get myself set up for this I made myself a little bit bigger I don't know if you noticed I I'm only in the corner here you can see if I move my arms out here that's actually the camera only goes this high and it only goes over to hear it actually extends all the way this way so i can stand over here and i'm still sorry i really should probably have the laptop over here and move this light over a little bit hold on i'm rearranging realize the way this is it's better for me to be further over because I will block less better better better and the water can go here okay so this is weird because the camera it just like looks like it's not pointed at me at all but right now I'm looking straight at the camera I can't but have to look over here to see my previous screen anyway but i can type here and then i can point to overhear a gesture look at this stuff ok this is working so p 5 GS instance mode let's see if there's anything else that I wanted to do instead of that no no oh I did this um until so many things so many things these are going to be good but I gotta be this I'm excited about Chrome extensions that I missed that one somewhere here let's see if anybody has written any comments down at the bottom here no 15 days ago I've seen these ok so here we go instance mode you're going to do it ok as eight people watching ok so I'm going to minimize this I am here and the before we get to instance mode I'm going to just make a some code here so we have something to work with and let's do this and let's run this now we can say let's make that quite a bit bigger and and give us some alpha okay so there we go so this is we're going to be my sketch that I'm going to turn into instance mode will talk about why you might want to use instance mode and all that sort of things I'm going to wipe my glasses okay and just for fun up you know I'm going to do I'm going to take a minute here and I'm gonna look for my tape you know I need one of those I should just get a GoPro and put it on my head and then I could have that also be a feed to live stream and you guys could see me I don't know where that tape one I know it's fine I just won't trip over this wire today it's gonna be fine okay now I'm over here I'm talking to this camera does that work okay it's shaders on the list someone asks shaders is not currently with mostly because i'm not really a shaders kind of person but I I think that would be worth adding the list and taking a look at at some point in particular in the context of processing versus WebGL and that type of thing so I'm adding that's my mental list right now that my taking a while to get to that if you're looking for a good to learn shaders I'm in the wrong computer I do have a recommendation for you something called the book of shaders by Patricio I googled it and here it is the book of shaders this is come on internet refresh um this is a wonderful set of tutorials and materials about shaders and i would highly recommend it as a good place to get started and what i will do is i will read this learn it and then make some videos based on it inspired by it perhaps if I can get myself to know about shaders okay so that's that shaders close this minimize this and we're going to talk about instance mode okay oh absolutely poops okay put this back here checking the chat ok here we go 12 people are here and I'm going to begin I feel ready I have a racer and have a whiteboard marker I have a glass of water and all I can do let's walk over here and hit a button and I wonder if I can do it like this so I could always edit out the beginning part hello I have space here now I'm walking back and forth um hello in this video I am going to talk about p5 jas instance mode what is p 5 GS instance mode why would you want to use it all of these strange questions will have an answer to them perhaps by the time we get for the end of this video I hope okay let's just see how this goes okay so first of all Here I am in a room with a screen behind me kind of and if i press command R and run this p 5 GS sketch I can move my mouse around and draw some nice purple circles so this is a p5 jazz sketch it has a setup it has a draw actually let me add something to this p 5 GS sketch let me add a variable X and what I'm going to do is I'm going to draw the ellipse at x and i'm going to say x equals x plus 5 and if x is greater than with x equals 0 so i'm going to do that and oh I'm going to save this as a instance mode now I'm going to run it so you can see now the circle is moving across the screen automatically but it moves with my Y position so this is a p5 j/s sketch I just start this whole video over because I'm kind of feel like I need to get into it a little bit faster and I'm like tired today I could do this I realize I want to have a global variable in this sketch so I'm going to change the way the sketch works and i'm going to say i'm going to change this sketch how much time do I have here 1247 I'm good if i run this okay so i'm just going to have the circle move randomly and let's say no stroke and give it even more alpha okay so this is my ghostly moving circle which kind of does this okay random walking circle ok so I'm going to start this over this is going to be the sketch and talk about p5 Jess instance mode hello Juan Vargas just got here in time ok uhhuh here we go again hello in this video I'm going to talk about something called instance mode in terms of P 5ks this is also sometimes kind of referred to as name spacing is like all these terms I hope that okay last time last time last time 15 people are here I have to just like power through this even though I'm tired hungry there's a reason for making this video and we're going to do it hello in this video I'm going to talk about something called p5 j/s instance mode what is that why would you want to use it what's the point of that well okay so but my way this is also sometimes we're related or refer to as name spacing in JavaScript so what do I mean by name spacing instance mode that sort of thing so look at this ap 5j s sketch a single global variable X a function set up and a function draw I hit run and we see this nice purplish circle moving about kind of painting on the screen you know this is the kind of stuff we do every day in our lives make these little p5 sketches with these purple circles that type of thing so where might this deed more than just this instance mode why would you need instance mode okay so here's one scenario let's say I wanted to do this create can and let's make this canvas smaller 200 200 and let's make it what if I wanted to have two canvases in the window so when i run this sketch and i look at the browser page i would see somehow like two different canvases well clearly that doesn't work p5 jazz in its default global mode plain old regular way it's written you can't actually add two canvases to the page so this is one reason why you need instance mode here's another reason what if i were to say something like whoops uh VAR window equals hello oh wonder if this will break everything it's giving me a warning by the way let's run this okay so this happened to work but it's a little bit dangerous and let's see what the warning is right look at this redefinition of window so window is a very important key global variable that just exists in javascript in the browser it's a variable is referring to the window object this window that's the whole sort of like browser window itself but I want to have like a window variable in my p5 gfs sketch because i like the word window and it's what i want to name my variable this is a problem because i don't want to mess with the global name space so that sounds like a horrible thing global namespace and for the most part in your life I hope you don't have to worry about the global namespace but sometimes you do and in the way that you write p 5 GS code saying function setup function draw VAR x all those things are global variables that exist across all of your javascript code so if you also incorporate other libraries like d3 or popcorn or some other thing that you might have variable names conflict with other things and this can be a problem so in essence name spacing is the act of saying all of the variables and things associated with my particular program are going to be under a particular name like I'm always going to say instead of var X I'm always going to say shipment x instead of our window I'm always going to say schiffman dot window so Schiffman dot window can never conflict with the global window because it isn't the global window it's Schiffman not window so these are the main two reasons if you're in some kind of complex scenario where namespacing having everything in your p5 sketch under a particular name becomes important to you or simply if you need more than one canvas on the screen on the screen in the window itself these are reasons why you need instance mode so hopefully that makes sense let's actually look at here's the thing though if you don't really need instance mode maybe you don't want instance mode because it's like a lot of extra code to write and it looks a little bit confusing but it is interesting and you might learn something you're still watching this video okay here we go so what I want to do is go back to this sketch just the way it was now where's the bottom of the editor window I'm zoomed in no wonder so let me move this back over here we look at where I'm standing next to the code great so the first thing I want to do is figure out how we're going to write the instance mode oh I was going to use the whiteboard I forget it add a new whiteboard I was going to use but this video doesn't really merit it I will see so basically what I what I want to do is I want to say something like this this is the idea of name spacing I want to create a actual object right this isn't p5 does this kind of magically for you you shouldn't be able to do what we just did just like write a setup function and somehow it magically gets triggered and write a draw function and somehow magically it looks p5 is written this way so that you can kind of get started quickly and behind the scenes it's like looking for a global setup function looking for a global draw function but ultimately what exists is like a p5 object and I'm calling it my P thought excuse me I want to make a new p5 object and that new p5 object should have in it all of the variables associated with my sketch and all of the the all of the functions associated I sketch the set up the draw all that sort of stuff so this is the idea but now inside this thing called sketch I need to put all of the stuffs get should have X in it sketch should have set up in it etc etc so the way that I write this and it's going to look a little bit weird it's like this I want to now make a sketch variable which is a function like this so this is known as this is a function a function is called sketch the function takes an argument called p I could name that whatever I want maybe i'll call it p 5 I don't know let's just call it Pete I pause really let's look at no I'm just gonna look over here hon hai's a cheat sheet for a second I should have had this up oh my goodness edit this out of this video or loop the jeopardy music over i just want to see ya okay I'm doing this I'm doing this right I knew I was right so so I need to create it's actually the closure oh I shouldn't have said closure and ever say closure in a video to makes everybody very uncomfortable but I I do have some other videos about this thing called a JavaScript closure but the idea is that I have this function called sketch and I'm going to attach all of the things that are going to be part of this actual p5 sketch so i'm going to say p dot x equals up actually i'm going to say 'pete set up equals function and i'm going to say p draw equals function and now i can go and get this code and it can go in here but i need to say p create this px py p dot background you know what I'm going to do I'm going to pause I'm going to go BAM it hits top here for a second it was I'm going to go back because I lost my train of thought that I had to look something up I don't know why I'm in this like mode of like fixing my mistakes because mistakes sometimes or what make everything work but I'm just going back for a second okay maybe you guys have some questions that I are in the chat hopefully you can still hear me and see everything I'm going to take a look at the chat really briefly okay some people I people arrived people are saying nice things putting in nice little emojis into the chat thank you okay thanks all for the nice comments okay um I'm going to pick up from a certain point and splice it together okay so i don't remember the problems i don't remember anything that i did so i think i'm going to try to pick up from somewhere around the point where i was talking about what to put in sketch so so I'm going to try that an awkward edit probably just happened right now because i went off on a tangent and I stopped and I restarted so this will get edited together hello and but i believe i blast left off talking about the fact that i want to make this p5 object that holds everything it has my ex in it has my setup in it has my draw in it but whoa did this actually work yeah hold on a second everybody I'm going to do this one more time see here's the problem i know what i'm going to do brilliant my example had a flaw in it which was yeah i know sketch is not defined okay great and so hold on my silver court once or queries stop everything's going to be okay everybody I think I've got it now okay hi everybody people are saying hi in the chat very nice i mean the middle trying to pick a tutorial about b5 instance mode I've messed it up like 15 times but I think now I'm gonna now I'm kind of back okay dododododo awkward edit just happened because I messed something up and went off on a tangent but I'm back now and the point where I left you was and I also made some changes in code the very slight you know pause look at it nothing important but the point where i am at is instead of having all of this stuff in the global namespace a global x a global why a global set up a global draw what I want is to smush everything inside of this object this new p5 object i'm making which i'm storing in a variable called my p5 so how do i do that well we see that there's this line of code that says my p 5 equals a new p5 and then we're passing in this thing called sketch so sketch the variable sketch is actually going to serve essentially as the template the template for the thing that's actually going to run so I make a variable called sketch which is actually equals a function which is a little bit weird but this is just kind of how things when you don't know it's nothing should be a JavaScript it probably should just be a function it's actually this is a closure and I don't I mean just even saying that that's where I that's why I had to stop the video and start over so to go down that road but you can think of this function as the template for creating the p5 sketch so the line of code that says VAR my p 5 equals new p5 is actually making the p5 sketch causing it to run and this thing called sketches where i'm going to put in all the pieces so without I need both of these things without the template I can't have the sketch but I can't make a sketch without the template so let's look at how we do that so notice how this function takes an argument and I arbitrarily called it P because P is the thing that I'm going to attach all the stuff that's going to go in the sketch to i'm going to say p x equals 100 + p y equals 100 and then i'm going to say p dot set up equals function and i'm going to say p draw equals function so now this you can see i'm filling in a name spacing everything i'm putting everything under this variable P P dot said Eppie draw PX and then we can see what's the other stuff that goes and set up I can copy this and get it and I can say P create canvas and Pete p background I can zoom out a little bit I can go down here and get all this stuff that was in draw and I can delete all of this now I don't need any of this global stuff anymore and i can paste this all in hearing say p dot fill p dot stroke and pita lips and PX and py and PX i should make this in a song in p dot y + p dot randleman p dot random but i don't need to say p 10 because 10 is a number okay um and now I run this just work would I get wrong is there an error no air okay so hold on let's look at this this looks pretty good to me I love what I did is I created uh you know what I wonder if this actually needs to be below yeah uncaught reference air so so interestingly enough i joined I felt like muttering under my breath a mistake that I made but I need to declare the template first and fill everything in before I can actually make that p5 object now I did get an error uncut reference our X is not defined line 14 look at that x and y are no longer global variables their name spaced under this thing called p PX py and there we go now we have our sketch and I i wish this sketch wasn't so long i can remove a few line breaks here just so you can kind of see it all on this one page but you can see now here's the template for the sketch everything namespace and now i'm creating that sketch now there's some interesting things going on here for example what if i were to do something totally insane but what outside of this what if i were to say set timeout this is a javascript function by the way a javascript function that allows you to do what at trigger event like I'm going to reset background I'm off on a little bit of a tangent here but that's okay and do that in three seconds three thousand milliseconds then I'm going to define that function reset background and in that function i'm going to say my p5 dot background to fifth 51 so look at this that sketch that p5 sketch is now inside of this object my p5 so elsewhere in the code right this is how I might use p5 in connection with another library if I'm in some other piece of code that's completely outside of the whole set of a drawing p5 thing I can reference that sketch call functions on it executes variables in it by saying my p5 so if I same IP five dot X I'm talking about this particular X up here but remember in the template everything's getting attached to P which gets put into sketch and sketch then gets made into my p5 and after the fact now everything associated with that sketch is in the variable might be five so let's see if this works and I can run this we can count to three one onethousand two onethousand three onethousand right and if I change this to set interval we can say one onethousand two onethousand three onethousand background one onethousand two onethousand three onethousand background one one thousand oh the thing went off you know what I should do is I should also say my p 5 X is in the middle now look at this my p5 dot y now look at this what's wrong with this something is horribly wrong you're not horribly wrong here right remember everything is namespace width and height don't exist in the global world so I need to say my p5 dot with my p5 height and I can run this now one onethousand two onethousand three onethousand one onethousand two onethousand three onethousand okay so you can see that this works and it's kind of a nice thing that you've got and you know it's hard to see on that camera went off but I'm going to turn it back on targets might be a little bit harder to see the the value here just in this sort of like trivial example but you could imagine if you've got a lot of code this could be useful but one more thing let's do before go in this video which is probably about 12 minutes so far is let's look at how this can allow you to have two canvases on the same page so what uh so let's look at that so one thing I could do is I could rename this to sketch one actually insanely here's something that's kind of in st. before I even do that let's call this my p51 and let's just do this my p5 to look at this and I'm gonna run this look at that too on the page operate so i could just duplicate that sketch by the way without oops and you know only one of them let's do this does reset background thing so i duplicate that sketch but notice only one of them is getting its background reset because i'm only referring to that what i'm after you're following because i just like i'm thinking of this weird stuff on the fly but this is actually kind of great about instance mode I made this template for a sketch objectoriented programming hello I made this template for the sketch right and then I'm baking copies of it and I don't have to rewrite that code i could just duplicate it and we could write this in a loop it suddenly have hundreds of these on the page all the separate canvases but you'll notice that i could also say i could call this sketch one and i could call this sketch too and I could I'm gonna do something totally uninteresting here which is just basically have it be the same sketch but with a different color and you can see now I have two sketches two canvases on the same page I can refer to them as my p51 I don't like my name's here my p51 in somewhere else so what instance mode allows you to do is take all the stuff that you would normally write globally and put it inside of this like function this closure function this function that and attach everything to this variable p PX py p dot Senate pedro then you have this template for making versions of that sketch that will appear on the page and you can control whether they get made yes or no so hopefully this makes sense to you and as you might find this useful in different scenarios where you need it i'm often saying like oh I think you need instant smoked and now I can point people to this video um and so ask your questions in the comments of trying if you make something like you know you're looking to do some kind of weird experiment maybe like fill the screen with a hundred copies of the same sketch and see what happens that way and also you know what happens when you start integrating the Dom library with this stuff that's kind of interesting to think about using p5 in conjunction with another library namespacing if try this stuff out if you do anything I share it in the comments below and I look forward to seeing you in another video in the future ok everyone yeah everyone so some people have joined so the reason why the email alerts to go through is because I you know I somehow I violated male chimps policy and I have a feeling now that you can't sign up either so let me let me see I'm gonna have to fix this let me go to so one thing I did is whoops ignore this if i go to Schiffman net and make this a little bit bigger there's a place where I could like sign up let's see if this works yeah it's I have a feeling that mail chimp is now shut me down so I'm gonna have to fix that somehow oh well but I'm as soon as I get back to my computer and off making these videos i will do that but i'm happy to take some questions I for the next 10 or 15 minutes if there's anybody in the chat with questions maybe I'll quickly post to twitter that i'll be live for 10 more Oh somebody actually wrote a question on Twitter hello is it this comes from at KU who Alan hello is it possible to have color map and color bar in processing or I have to draw an image in overlay text from scratch not sure I entirely understand that question so possible have color map and color bar in processing or I have to draw an image and overlay text scratch I think maybe the question is asking if you can have like a color picker in processing and there's no automatic way to do that you know I'm kind of quickly launching processing here is it open in other words all processing does is create a window you know you write some code it launches the window you don't really get anything for free that you can put gooey stuff that sort of thing however somebody could easily write a library for processing that allows you to have that I don't know that one exists for a color picker there is actually a color picker which is part of the interface itself under here color selector so you actually can use this as this this is not something that's launching as part of your code or your program but if you're looking for a quick way to pick colors and see RGB values inside processing that does exist alright that was a question let's see if there are any other questions ah so could you demo a restart reset button to restart the p5 sketch great question from an HTML button ok ok ok a hold on oh there's a bunch of there's a bunch of questions here which are good so let me get to all of them the the reset button is a bit of a longer one I'll actually make that into a video I could probably just take five or ten minutes and I want to save that as its own chunk leeandra asks can you show the code output again please so this is this i will post this code will get posted on github and linked from the video description as soon as i get to that later today do p5 objects have a default constructor I think what you're meaning what you're what you're asking is if you said something like this something like that will any what will happen so you can see actually something did happen it probably put an empty 100 by 100 canvas just right here so there is apparently a default constructor it will do something but nothing happens at all in it which is interesting to see so you can I made a p5 sketch it just doesn't have any code associated with it is multiple canvases very different than using create graphics that's a great question so it's very similar conceptually it's exactly the same idea but create graphics does not actually create a Dom element canvas that's viewable that's associated with a set up in a draw so I'm having trouble answering this because I can barely understand it myself but mult a create graphics makes a canvas create canvas makes a canvas but create canvas is like a special p5 function that makes a canvas that's associated with a set up in a draw whereas create graphics just makes the canvas element itself so if you want a canvas that you can kind of control on the p5 way you've got to use create canvas multiple ones you've got to use instance mode but you can make multiple canvases that you're kind of controlling and manipulating in your own special way simply with kreeya graphics does that make sense hopefully that makes sense ok so both XP asks could you demo a reset button from an HTML button to restart a p5 sketch and this is a great question so I'm going to let me get myself prepared here and let's think about let me go let me actually open up an example and I'm hesitate to do the flocking one because it's so got so much involved but let's let me open up the flocking one and yeah this will work because of when I hit reset that I want this stuff to start over again from the beginning okay and I want to make an HTML button okay and let me just see here Dom libraries included okay so I'm going to do this I'm going to take out some of these comments that are overly long what else oh yeah oh this is always one that's interesting where is there I just want to bothers me that the scrolling is an issue well there's nothing I can do about that and i right this is silly what I'm doing sorry everybody I was trying to make it so it wouldn't scroll left and right but there's really no way around that you know what I'm going to do is I'm going to take all of this and put it in a flock jas sorry I'm just preparing this example and here flock Jan so there's less code why is it doing that come on Oh p5 editor how you torture me save that's weird all right fine oh because it's in the it's the examples flocking okay great sorry sorry everybody and let's see here and i'm going to do i'm doing silly things that are totally unnecessary to get ready to answer this question okay so what I'm going to do now is look at I'm going to leave this sketch with no comments simple sketch I'm going to look at how we add a button to this sketch and whenever you click the button the sketch restarts okay now incidentally I'm not going to mention this in the video but incidentally if i was using instance mode I could just like kill that object to maybe remake it but I don't think that's really a good way of doing it so I'm going to do it a different way in this video there's some other questions that people are asking i'll come back to them after i do this ok so here we go this is a great question hello in this video I'm the wall scratched in a weird way okay hi a question just came in in the live chat how do you create an HTML button that when you press that button your p5 sketch or restarts itself so I'm going to look very quickly at how to do that in this particular video so I have one of the p5 examples called flocking it's running a flocking simulation there's a lot of code involved with this but we can see that actually what's in setup and draw is quite simple and mostly all the code is happening in other objects how that works is not really the contents of this video I want to look at how we're going to have the sketch restart with a button so first of all let's at least look how do we add the button to this page so the way that you can add a button in a p5 sketch is using the p5 Dom library and you want to make sure that your you've got the Dom library included if you're using this desktop editor which by the time you watch this video might be completely different or obsolete but the main thing here is you want to make sure in your index.html file that you're referencing the p5 Dom library which I am here as well because I'm going to the button is not part of just the plain vanilla p5 library so that's already set for me and as soon as that's true i can say create button and i'll pass a single argument to that function reset so now if i run the sketch you can see oh you can see here i'm gonna shrink this down a little bit there we go you can see all the way here at the bottom there's a button that says reset now of course if I were to click this button nothing's going to happen because I haven't actually attached any event to it so I need to attach an event to that button the way that I attach an event to that button is first of all I need a variable to store a reference to that button so that i can say button dot mouse press reset sketch so what i want to do is that this particular button that's on the page when i press that button i want to execute a function called reset sketch which will somehow reset the sketch now reset sketch isn't some function that exists as part of p5 it's a name that I just made up because I'm gonna write it now your instinct might be to do this just call setup setup as a function whenever I press the button call setup again let's try that let's save our code we might and let's see what happens now weirdly that work but look what's happening like a more buttons are being added all sorts of things are happening right because everything create canvas was called again which is a little bit of a problem so this is a bad idea I don't even though this kind of worked I don't want to tie the setup function to a particular event which is why i said i want to make my own function called reset sketch so what does that mean i need to then write a function called reset sketch and in this function is where I want to put all the code that should happen when a sketch is restarted so you might be gathering now watching this video realizing oh there's not a way to just do this automatically and I would think there really isn't it's up to you to kind of define what it means to reset a sketch and then execute that code at the appropriate time the good news for you is I could say you know what I think it means to reset a sketch I think it means only to do this stuff it means to make a new flock object and to add a hundred voids to that flock object so I can take that code and put it into reset sketch and you know what I can do even better than that I don't need you your instinct might have been to do this oops to take that code and copy it in there and now this is actually good right you see the sketch is running I hit the button every time I hit the button it's resetting the sketch so you could say that we're done but I don't like this I just duplicated this entire block of code down here in this function and what if i want to change what's happening when I reset the sketch but also have that happen in setup well the fact that i made this resets sketch function means i can also call it and set up so basically now if we look at setups code this is wonderful what I what setup does is it basically says create a canvas set up the sketch and by the way make a button that if you ever press that button set up the sketch again so basically everything associated with starting the sketch is in reset sketch except for making the canvas which I really only want to do once and making the reset button which I really only want to do one so now if i run this sketch we can see there it is flocking and if i hit reset every time I hit that button it resets the sketch and this my friends is a less than five minute tutorial video and I'm so tempted to keep talking but lest i go over five minutes I'm gonna hit stop so hopefully you found this useful if you make your own button or something that resets a sketch let me know and share it in the comments or ask questions or comments and I will get back to you and this code will also the code the code for this get form is for guys the code for the sketch will also be posted to github and a link will be in the description goodbye ok let's see ok so I'm going to go back and look at some of the questions I don't know what I do with my phone here it is because I'm just checking to see if I have any important messages which it doesn't look like i do it's 120 ok so let me look at some of these questions oh la shop floor ask so really great question uhoh you know what let me add that I'll tack it on to the end that was a great question because frame count didn't get reset mmm let's see if we can fix that ok oh ok when hit record so much for my short video a question came up in the chat which i think is an important one which is what about frame count so let's look at this so what I'm going to do is I'm going to also create a paragraph create p and i'm going to put the words frame count in it and i'm also going to say i want it to appear kind of large so if i run the sketch now oops that's way too large you can see here I've got frame count here so what I want to do now in draw is say text HTML the actual frame count variable let's see so you can see now you can see a problem with my brilliant solution which is that as the sketch is running the frame count is going up and up and up and if I hit reset that frame count did not reset right because i didn't really restart p 5 as a whole i just restarted all the stuff for my sketch so global things in p5 are continuing however I have a feeling that we can actually just you know over right frame count and p5 will just be like that's fine you take care of it if you want so if i do that and run it and then hit reset nut didn't work uhhuh right it doesn't because it's probably keeping track of it somewhere else in a different variable oh boy okay pause video actually we keep recording video maybe this will be a separate I don't know what to do okay well let's figure this out let me see if there's some other questions here and i'm going to show you guys how to how to determine what the answer this is but i'll keep going i'll get to those other questions later so what we need to do is look in the p5 actual source code so i'm looking in the p5 source code and i'm going to look for anywhere frame count is mentioned it's in all so much of the documentation that's so unfortunate setproperty frame count this frame count plus one this happens in the draw function during the loop so i'm looking and like is there different like this this dot setproperty let's look for that function this property window if its global window dot property so i wonder if i do something like this dot frame count no our window dot frame count weird right because oh because what am I missing here because prop value window prop buying this this stuff ring count plus one I don't know how to get it's weird that I'm not able to get access to that variable all right hold on let's look for other places there must be some other that's the really where is it uhhuh where does it get its first value zero so I'm stumped here maybe somebody in the chat I'm going to have to I'm gonna have to go look this up I'm gonna have to look at this later something that chap might have an idea i'm gonna answer some other questions Oh somebody else okay so okay so can a p5 objects set up then draw function be modified once it has been created yes it can however note that setup will never get executed again so if you modify the p5 sketch object setup function later it's that's not going to make any difference but if you modify the draw function while draws being called continuously that new draw function will be executed that's probably a question related back to the video i made previously about about instance mode ok any thoughts on the ITP camp in june will you be in attendance ok so somebody asks ITP camp so i'm just going to go there ITP that nyu edu slash camp there is a fourweek program at ITP you can look at the information about it read about it it's a fun interesting program to meet people do some interesting projects it's you know one university unconference type of style thing so I do recommend it I think it's a great experience I have to say that I don't know that i'll be around it that off in this particular summer so but i would encourage you if you're interested in more stuff with creative code and then taking a look at it and I was not a very good answer this question okay is it looking at the time the sketch ran and computed from there with the problem yeah you know I don't think it is because if i look at the p5 if I again if i look at it's just incrementing the current frame count and adding one to it like it's going so let me comment this out right I'm actually modifying the p5 source code right now if I comment that out and run my sketch you can see that it's not going up now what if I what if I in draw say this it is going up and then what if I do this well that was that now I'm able to override it but so basically this answer is kind of like just make your own variable that's so here's an interesting question though what happens if I put that back in and increment it is it going up by two I can't tell let's make the frame rate slower to 30 it did it once it did it like the first time through draw boy I'm really stumped with this one I've Lauren McCarthy word we're here I'm sure she would know the answer to it instantly but um I'm gonna look at this and get back to you live stream viewers really thinking about this because if i look at the implementation this is the thing that's doing it this is the same variable right if I say console dot log this dot frame count oh you know it's not I guess this console log doesn't show up here epsilon hmm I don't know I don't know what to say there's obviously something that I missing and it probably has to do with this okay hold on a sec let's leave this here and what this will cause other problems yeah I'll find this okay I'm stumped I'm gonna have to look at this later let me see if there's any other questions all right it's yeah so so I mean the guy went down a bit of a rabbit hole yer the truth of the matter is it's not that big of a deal because if I really want to solve this problem here's what I would choose to do I would just make up my own variable called frame counter I would set it equal to 0 i would say frame counter equals zero in reset sketch and then at the very very end i would say frame counter plus plus so now you can see oh and i can take this out and this can just start as 0 and if I run this you can see now whoa oh oh right this has to say frame counter and now you can see that every time we hit the reset button that will also restart so I think the answer in this case is if you really need that reset button you might just be better off kind of making up your own variable not using a p5 global wealth i think i got i got like three extra gray hairs during that little sequence right here okay I will I'm going to do a little whatever for five minutes while see if anybody has any last questions I'm just over here looking to see to make sure everything recorded properly and i will wait a little bit to see if there's any last questions in the chat 616 anyway so I made a tutorial today and we look at all of these let's copy these over oops ah sorry I'm copying some videos and copying these over let's see if this works who know too much too much that's from the other day that's from the other day whoops sorry everybody I'm gonna check the chat a second see what questions there are okay I think I'm good now for the videos are recorded okay what's the next video topic well I'm done for today unfortunately so for the next video topic but let's go to talk about what I hope to do so I had um you know what I need to do for a second where I'm lost oh I lost my preview that's why I need to I just need to record something with the whiteboard just so I can see what it looks like later because next week i'm hoping to get to the things that I'm hoping to do is make chrome extension three big things i want to do is make a whole set of videos on how to make a chrome extension I want to make a whole set of videos about git and github and then I want to return back to the connect and computer vision stuff and make more of those and in terms of I just I did the p5 instance mode and then there's some other little ones that I might like to do at some point but that's what I'm hoping to do at this point probably next week I might have a chance to make a video or two tomorrow but what I want to do before I go is I'm gonna hit record and I come over here whoops this camera is off I'm just want to see how this looks so pretend I'm talking to you which I actually am and i'm using this whiteboard marker and i'm going to say something like function yeah there's too many shadows i don't think i have the lighting good here function setup function draw we went to wrap these up in 2 p5 instance mode and maybe there will be a scary creature it was actually really friendly with rainbows and a unicorn no smiling ok and then if I draw down here is this too low and if I walk over here and I talked to the camera and gesture over here I'm gonna see what take a look this looks like you guys can tell me was that sort of legible the letting this there's like kind of bad shadow up here because I'd these lights up above but there's a big bar pipe in here so it's causing a bit of a shadow plus I have this light down here which was for the green screen which is shadowing me turn this off for a second this better still I don't know if this is better turn that light off turn this light on I don't know it's brighter down here you can see you maybe I need another one over here I just need more lights I think ok but that was good ok check the job and hit stopped because I want to take a look at this video later to see what it looked like put that in here Oh keep both ok ups that camera went off the cameras these gamers shut off after 30 minutes which I actually could fix but ok p5 sketches with express can you show how to make it work real quick well I don't so there's not really I would I'm not a little confused by that question I'm probably just an understanding something but basically a P thought p5 is a clientside library only so what you could do is host your HTML javascript files with annex node Express app and actually I do this only make sure let me see if this is on my list because I do I'd made some node if I go to the I made a kind of basics of node video for the Twitter bot stuff but i think i should do i should add a somewhere here i should add a little bit there's more stuff that i think in terms of where have am i missing this where's the twitter bot one here it is node + p 5 serve p 5 sketch do the you know proxy data query is something you might want to do as well as save to a file database so these are some things that I do want to make videos about actually at some point which is that there's certain things that you can't do clientside like save data to a server you can do that on you know you use a Google spreadsheet actually from the client side or use a if you used to be this thing called parse but that since been shut down and someone I believe firebase a student and I TP gave me a recommendation to look at firebase so there are but there are certain things you might want to do if you use node as your server programming with p5 as your client programming all my videos have pretty much just been only client programming the server stuff is actually happening because of the p5 editor or wherever you're uploading your sketches there's just happens to be a server there already but if you want to program your own server there is some interesting things you can do and I do have notes about this in I go to a shipment github I 08 so here I do have some examples but this is a course that I taught last fall somewhere in here note under node may be a note in api's week 11 I believe that I have some more stuff about a using node in connection with and so I want to make some video tutorials about that so I will that's a good thing to add to my list boy not enough to um you know I'm going to be doing this all the way through the summer so hopefully I'll get to all this stuff okay so thank you everyone for tuning in today I'm going to upload those videos the instance mode video and the reset in the p 5 GS sketch with a button video I'll be back next week making more give me some feedback either on Twitter or something or email or in the comments of how this whiteboard thing looked because I'm anybody it's a lighting expert and want to offer some help particular if you're like an ITP students didn't have to be watching this i'll be at ITP for a little bit tomorrow maybe you can do about it ok I'm going to I'm going to sign off down and hit this button and sign off ok see you later everybody
