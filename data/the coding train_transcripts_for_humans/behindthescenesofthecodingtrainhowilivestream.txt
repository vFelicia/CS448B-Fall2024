00:00 - Hello, and welcome to a
special episode of The Coding
00:02 - Train, where I'm going to show
you the recording studio where
00:05 - I make all of the tutorial
videos and livestreams.
00:07 - So I'm at the Kanbar
Institute of Film and TV
00:09 - at NYU Tisch School of the Arts.
00:12 - Behind this door
is a small closet
00:15 - where I've recorded
many video tutorials.
00:16 - Other people have made tutorials
and things from this room.
00:20 - And actually, we're going
to be moving to a new studio
00:23 - later this summer,
so I wanted to make
00:25 - sure to document this in case
you want to make your own video
00:27 - tutorials.
00:27 - Hopefully, there'll be some nice
tidbits of information for you.
00:30 - All right, I'm going
to open this door
00:31 - and I'm going to go inside.
00:32 - Come on.
00:36 - And I have now entered
the studio space.
00:39 - I am walking over to the desk
where I record everything,
00:43 - and I'm seeing you because
I'm recording from here.
00:45 - There's a camera here recording.
00:46 - Those are the only two things
that are recording right now.
00:49 - So I'm actually also currently
streaming this to YouTube.
00:52 - It's not publicly
livestreamed right now.
00:54 - Members and patrons
are watching.
00:56 - And so what I'm going
to do is talk through
00:58 - all of the different
pieces of what
01:00 - I use when I'm
livestreaming, and then we'll
01:04 - show you from
different perspectives
01:06 - so you can see how
everything works.
01:07 - So the first thing
that I want to show you
01:09 - is this computer over here.
01:11 - So, this is actually
the streaming computer.
01:14 - It's not the streaming computer.
01:15 - It's the monitor attached
to the streaming computer.
01:18 - And it's running Open
Broadcast Studio,
01:20 - which is what I'm using to
send the audio and video data.
01:23 - And it has also got a little
window of a YouTube chat
01:26 - going here that I can see.
01:28 - And so the most important thing
to do if you want to stream
01:30 - to YouTube-- which, you can use
Open Broadcast Studio to stream
01:33 - to a number of other things--
01:34 - is to connect YouTube with
Open Broadcast Studio.
01:37 - And the way you do that is
through the livestreaming
01:39 - dashboard.
01:40 - So this is the dashboard.
01:42 - It shows a little preview
of what I'm streaming.
01:44 - It shows how many
people are viewing
01:45 - at a given time, the average
watch time, play times,
01:48 - the chat rate.
01:49 - I have already connected Open
Broadcast Studio and YouTube
01:52 - because I'm broadcasting this
and recording it to disk.
01:56 - But I'm going to show
you how to do that.
01:58 - So under the stream
settings, there's
02:01 - a particular property
called Ingestion.
02:03 - And you can see here there's
a stream URL, a backup server
02:07 - URL.
02:08 - These are all already put
into the streaming software,
02:10 - Open Broadcast Studio.
02:12 - But there is also
this stream name/key.
02:15 - So if I were to
copy this and then
02:17 - change into Open Broadcast
Studio under Settings,
02:22 - under Stream, this is where
I want to paste that key.
02:25 - Now, this is grayed out
right now because I'm already
02:28 - streaming, but
that's how YouTube--
02:31 - my event on YouTube,
my livestreaming
02:33 - event on YouTube--
is connected to Open
02:35 - Broadcast Studio itself.
02:36 - So there's a lot of other
settings here under Output.
02:39 - I can change the Recording,
the Audio settings,
02:42 - all sorts of things.
02:43 - But you can see right here under
these buttons, I am streaming,
02:46 - and I am recording.
02:48 - So now that we see how Open
Broadcast Studio and YouTube
02:51 - are connected, let's look
at how is Open Broadcast
02:54 - Studio getting the camera image,
my laptop image, combining it,
02:58 - all that sort of stuff.
02:59 - So everything starts with
this computer over here
03:03 - on the floor.
03:04 - Probably, it would
be better to put
03:05 - this on a shelf or something,
but what are you going to do?
03:09 - So, this is a Canon Mark III 5D.
03:13 - It's plugged into power, so
it's not running off of battery.
03:17 - It has HDMI OUT.
03:19 - That HDMI OUT is going
through a Black Magic
03:23 - box, which basically takes
HDMI IN, Thunderbolt OUT,
03:27 - and converts it to
a capture device.
03:29 - So it then goes
into this computer
03:31 - and it's being captured.
03:33 - The laptop, through
USB-C, is also
03:38 - connected to HDMI, which also
goes into a Black Magic box
03:41 - and into the computer.
03:43 - In Open Broadcast Studio,
I can then create a scene.
03:47 - And so let's make a new one.
03:49 - I'm gonna make a new
scene called "test."
03:51 - That's a great name.
03:55 - [AUDIO OUT]
04:00 - All right, now
I've added the mic.
04:01 - You can actually hear me.
04:02 - But the screen is black.
04:05 - So now I added the mic input.
04:06 - So this scene now has audio.
04:08 - Then what I'm going to add is--
04:11 - let's add another source.
04:12 - And because those go through
those Black Magic boxes,
04:15 - I can add a Black Magic device.
04:17 - I can add an existing
one like green canon.
04:20 - And there it is.
04:20 - It's actually already got
the chroma keying filter,
04:25 - but let me just turn that off.
04:27 - I'm going to hide that.
04:28 - So now you can see this
is the actual camera view.
04:30 - You can see this
secondary laptop
04:31 - that I have with
green paper on it.
04:34 - I'm going to just shrink
this so you could see.
04:36 - I could rotate it, I could
flip it, I could do color,
04:39 - I could do all sorts
of stuff to it.
04:40 - There's lots of features
of Open Broadcast Studio.
04:43 - But let me add another source.
04:45 - I'm going to go
Blackmagic Device,
04:47 - and I'm going to add laptop.
04:51 - Now you can see, the laptop
is the feed from here,
04:54 - but it's covering it.
04:56 - So what I want to do is
move green canon above it.
04:59 - So now you can see the
green canon is above it.
05:04 - But let me put the
chroma keying back in.
05:06 - So I'm going to click on
that, Filters add Chroma Key.
05:09 - We could just see--
and by the way,
05:11 - there's lots of other filters
here that you could try.
05:13 - I'm going to hit Close.
05:14 - I'm going to put this
down, and there we go.
05:16 - And I'm going to put
myself over to the side.
05:18 - So this is basically
the configuration
05:21 - I use for The Coding Train
when I'm live broadcasting.
05:23 - So I'm here.
05:24 - I can turn here.
05:25 - I can sort of see.
05:26 - So if I pull up some code, if
I pull up, like, the p5 web
05:31 - editor, I can see it over
here as I stand this way.
05:34 - So it's like I'm telling
you what the weather is
05:36 - in the p5 web editor.
05:39 - So I look over
here at the camera,
05:40 - I type over here
on the computer,
05:42 - then I go and I sort of see
a monitor of the composite.
05:44 - Then I see that over here.
05:45 - So also, while
I'm livestreaming,
05:47 - I like to keep the corner
of my eye on the live chat.
05:50 - So usually what I'll do is I'll
take the chat as a little pop
05:56 - out window, and put it next
to Open Broadcast Studio,
05:59 - and increase the
size of the font.
06:01 - And we can see, now, all
of the various members
06:04 - like SolarLiner, and
Xavier, and motiontx
06:07 - who are watching and
telling me that there
06:09 - was no sound earlier, which
is always really helpful.
06:12 - I also have a
secondary Slack channel
06:16 - going on this extra laptop
where I also keep the dashboard
06:20 - so I can see who's watching and
how many people, which right
06:22 - now is nine concurrent viewers.
06:25 - So maybe you've also noticed
that I sometimes play music
06:27 - or different sound effects.
06:28 - And those are coming
here from this iPad.
06:31 - So this iPad is running a piece
of software called Soundcue.
06:34 - The audio is playing
out of this laptop,
06:36 - to coming out of
the headphone jack
06:38 - into this little Onyx Blackjack
USB recording interface.
06:44 - So it actually then comes out
of here, USB, into this laptop.
06:49 - Because that way,
the laptop's audio
06:52 - is going out into
the recording system.
06:55 - So that can be included as
part of the live broadcast,
07:01 - because when I play
audio here, under laptop,
07:07 - you can see the green
under microphone going up,
07:09 - and you can see the green
under laptop going up.
07:12 - Both of these are two
separate audio sources.
07:15 - So I can capture audio
from this laptop itself,
07:17 - if there was sound in an
example I'm programming.
07:20 - But I could also get the
audio from this iPad,
07:23 - into this laptop, into there.
07:25 - And to do that, I'm
using a piece of software
07:28 - called Loopback.
07:30 - Loopback is Taking the audio
from the Onyx Blackjack
07:35 - interface, and it's
actually monitoring it out
07:38 - through the Multi-Output
Device, which
07:40 - is actually the DisplayPort,
the HDMI OUT port.
07:43 - And then it's coming into Open
Broadcast Studio that way.
07:45 - So this mic here
is going directly
07:47 - into Open Broadcast Studio
via a separate USB input
07:52 - to the streaming computer, but
then the audio from this iPad
07:57 - is coming out separately
through this computer.
07:59 - This computer.
08:00 - So many computers.
08:01 - This lab mic, this is
the wireless receiver.
08:05 - So all the audio from this
mic here is coming into here.
08:08 - Then this is another
USB interface
08:11 - into the streaming computer.
08:12 - So that's where my
audio is coming from.
08:15 - So over here in this
other part of the closet,
08:20 - I have a second camera, also
HDMI OUT into a Black Magic
08:24 - box.
08:25 - And this camera is pointed
at this whiteboard.
08:27 - So this is actually
not a whiteboard.
08:28 - It's just whiteboard
paint on the wall.
08:30 - So it's actually
not the greatest
08:33 - because it's hard to
clean, but it is nice
08:36 - that it covers so much space.
08:37 - So what I do during
a live stream,
08:39 - if I want to draw some sort
of diagram, with a rainbow,
08:46 - and this one's
going to be a cat.
08:49 - Then what I do is, I
have a separate scene
08:53 - that's in Open Broadcast
Studio called whiteboard.
08:57 - So I could just click on
this, and there you go.
08:59 - You see the whiteboard.
09:01 - I'm going to go
back to this one.
09:03 - But that's inconvenient.
09:06 - I used to have this button
that was hooked up to change,
09:10 - to tell it to give up,
Open Broadcasting Studio,
09:12 - to switch between
the different scenes.
09:14 - But it so happens that you could
just use a keyboard to do this.
09:18 - So in Open Broadcast Studio,
under Settings, under Hotkeys,
09:24 - you can set certain keys to
switch to a certain scene.
09:29 - So if I say Two, then now I've
switched to the whiteboard.
09:33 - I can walk over here.
09:35 - You can see me.
09:36 - I can draw here
on the whiteboard.
09:37 - And then I can walk back.
09:38 - And if I hit One, I'm
now back over here
09:42 - talking to you about this.
09:44 - So Two goes to the
whiteboard, One,
09:46 - and then I have other hotkeys.
09:48 - Like, the key z will quickly
turn off the computer.
09:52 - So if ever I'm about to type in
a password or some secret API
09:55 - key that I don't want people
to see, I can turn that off.
09:58 - Or if I'm playing--
09:58 - I forgot to do this,
actually, this morning--
10:00 - but If I'm playing
a video or something
10:02 - and I don't want to
stand in the shot,
10:04 - I can disappear or
reappear however I want.
10:06 - There's so much more in
Open Broadcast Studio.
10:09 - You know, I could have a
fade between the scenes
10:11 - and all that kind of stuff.
10:11 - I could have a preview
of what's coming next.
10:14 - But I'm using it
the most simple way.
10:16 - I also always keep my copy
of A Million Random Digits
10:19 - nearby in case I want to relax
and read some random numbers.
10:23 - I usually have a
train whistle, but I
10:25 - didn't bring it with me today.
10:26 - It's very sad.
10:27 - But I do have a bell
which I like to ring.
10:30 - Thank you for watching this
behind-the-scenes video
10:33 - about The Coding
Train recording studio
10:35 - here at NYU at Tisch
School of the Arts.
10:37 - As I mentioned
earlier, this studio
10:39 - is being shut down at
the end of this month.
10:42 - We're moving to a new
building in Brooklyn.
10:44 - I'm hoping to set
up some recording
10:45 - equipment and a new
space there, and also, I
10:48 - have some other designs
and some other places
10:50 - that I might make videos.
10:51 - So stay tuned for that.
10:52 - If you have questions
about the setup,
10:54 - things that I
didn't cover, please
10:55 - ask them in the comments.
10:56 - If you have your own live
streaming setup that you use
11:00 - or have tips for people,
please add those as well.
11:03 - And thank you so much.
11:04 - Goodbye.
11:08 - I'm still here.

Hello, and welcome to a special episode of The Coding Train, where I'm going to show you the recording studio where I make all of the tutorial videos and livestreams. So I'm at the Kanbar Institute of Film and TV at NYU Tisch School of the Arts. Behind this door is a small closet where I've recorded many video tutorials. Other people have made tutorials and things from this room. And actually, we're going to be moving to a new studio later this summer, so I wanted to make sure to document this in case you want to make your own video tutorials. Hopefully, there'll be some nice tidbits of information for you. All right, I'm going to open this door and I'm going to go inside. Come on. And I have now entered the studio space. I am walking over to the desk where I record everything, and I'm seeing you because I'm recording from here. There's a camera here recording. Those are the only two things that are recording right now. So I'm actually also currently streaming this to YouTube. It's not publicly livestreamed right now. Members and patrons are watching. And so what I'm going to do is talk through all of the different pieces of what I use when I'm livestreaming, and then we'll show you from different perspectives so you can see how everything works. So the first thing that I want to show you is this computer over here. So, this is actually the streaming computer. It's not the streaming computer. It's the monitor attached to the streaming computer. And it's running Open Broadcast Studio, which is what I'm using to send the audio and video data. And it has also got a little window of a YouTube chat going here that I can see. And so the most important thing to do if you want to stream to YouTube which, you can use Open Broadcast Studio to stream to a number of other things is to connect YouTube with Open Broadcast Studio. And the way you do that is through the livestreaming dashboard. So this is the dashboard. It shows a little preview of what I'm streaming. It shows how many people are viewing at a given time, the average watch time, play times, the chat rate. I have already connected Open Broadcast Studio and YouTube because I'm broadcasting this and recording it to disk. But I'm going to show you how to do that. So under the stream settings, there's a particular property called Ingestion. And you can see here there's a stream URL, a backup server URL. These are all already put into the streaming software, Open Broadcast Studio. But there is also this stream name/key. So if I were to copy this and then change into Open Broadcast Studio under Settings, under Stream, this is where I want to paste that key. Now, this is grayed out right now because I'm already streaming, but that's how YouTube my event on YouTube, my livestreaming event on YouTube is connected to Open Broadcast Studio itself. So there's a lot of other settings here under Output. I can change the Recording, the Audio settings, all sorts of things. But you can see right here under these buttons, I am streaming, and I am recording. So now that we see how Open Broadcast Studio and YouTube are connected, let's look at how is Open Broadcast Studio getting the camera image, my laptop image, combining it, all that sort of stuff. So everything starts with this computer over here on the floor. Probably, it would be better to put this on a shelf or something, but what are you going to do? So, this is a Canon Mark III 5D.
