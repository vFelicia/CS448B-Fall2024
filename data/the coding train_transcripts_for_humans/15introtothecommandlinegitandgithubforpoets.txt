00:00 - - Hello, this is part
5, or actually part 5A
00:03 - of my Git and GitHub tutorial series.
00:05 - I'm taking a break in
this particular video
00:09 - of focusing on Git
concepts through the use
00:13 - of the GitHub website to
talk about something called
00:16 - terminal and shell commands
and terminal prompt
00:17 - and Unix and that sort of thing.
00:20 - So why am I talking about this?
00:21 - The goals of this video
series now that we've covered
00:23 - basic Git and GitHub concepts is for you
00:26 - to work locally on your laptop
to work with Git offline,
00:31 - not through the GitHub website
00:32 - and that's going to be very
useful for a variety of reasons
00:34 - that you will see as I get
through these various tutorials.
00:37 - Now, here's the thing, how do you do that?
00:40 - I am using the Mac computer
system operating system
00:47 - snow tiger leopard something or other,
00:51 - making the same joke I made 10 minutes ago
00:53 - but you don't know that I'm doing that
00:54 - and I shouldn't have done
that but I did it anyway
00:56 - and it was better the first
time but I got to keep going.
00:59 - So I'm using this, someone
will edit that out.
01:03 - I'm using this Apple operating system
01:05 - and so I could download
software that allows me
01:08 - to run Git through a visual interface
01:10 - but the way that I work
with Git is by typing
01:12 - in Git commands to a terminal prompt
01:15 - and this, if I can bring this
up, is what a terminal prompt
01:19 - looks like and this is
what a command looks like.
01:22 - Draw a circle!
01:24 - Of course, that's not a valid command.
01:26 - If I hit enter, it's
going to say -bash: Draw:
01:27 - command not found.
01:29 - So what is this bash,
what is this terminal?
01:30 - This is actually emulating,
this is the types
01:33 - of commands I'm typing in
here are the same commands
01:35 - I would type to a Unix operating system.
01:37 - So this is Mac OS
01:41 - ZYX.
01:42 - You might be using Windows.
01:44 - Unix is another operating system that is
01:46 - you entirely interface with
through the command line.
01:49 - So if you want to do the stuff
that I'm going to show you
01:51 - in this video on the Mac,
you want to open up terminal,
01:54 - if you're opening up terminal
for the very first time,
01:55 - that's very exciting.
01:56 - You can find it by even
just going in and searching
02:00 - for terminal, you can see there it is.
02:02 - But it is in
applications/utilities as well.
02:04 - If you are on Windows, I would
suggest that you download
02:07 - something called Git Bash
which I'll include a link
02:11 - to downloading that in
this video's description.
02:14 - You can actually use our
various shell prompts
02:17 - in Windows and I believe that Unix shells
02:19 - are coming to Windows
natively perhaps in the future
02:22 - or by the time you're watching this video,
02:24 - maybe they're already there but Git Bash
02:26 - I know will work if you're following along
02:28 - the stuff that I'm doing
in this particular video.
02:29 - Okay so what I need to
show you now are what are
02:32 - the basic commands that you
might want to type here?
02:34 - Maybe there's a command called help.
02:37 - There is.
02:38 - So you can see that there's lots of things
02:39 - you can just come up with, type something,
02:41 - see what happens and this is a huge topic,
02:43 - I could make 100 videos probably
about things you could do,
02:46 - Unix command prompt.
02:47 - One that I'm going to show you
right now is you can type clear
02:50 - and it just clears you
right back up to the top
02:52 - which is nice to sort of clear what's been
02:53 - on your screen previously
but I'm going to make a list
02:56 - over here, the main thing
that you want to do,
02:58 - learn before you go on to
the next video and again,
03:00 - if you've already, if you know
about Unix shell commands,
03:02 - you can just skip ahead to the next video
03:05 - is working with your file system.
03:07 - So the main way to work
with your file system
03:09 - is actually one single command called cd,
03:12 - change directory, just
like you might double click
03:14 - on a folder through the
interface, cd is like changing
03:17 - the directory that your
command line prompt
03:20 - is currently actively associated with.
03:23 - There's also the command
which I use a lot called pwd,
03:26 - print working directory and then there
03:29 - is also the command ls which lists, lists,
03:32 - the contents of the
current working directory.
03:35 - So these are essentially the
main ones that you want to use.
03:39 - We saw clear, I'll probably
as I start doing stuff
03:42 - by accident use a few other commands
03:44 - but let's just get comfortable
with these basic commands
03:47 - before we move on to
executing all the git commands
03:50 - in terminal as well.
03:52 - I'm coming back over here and
now I'm going to just start
03:56 - by typing in my first command.
03:59 - My first command is going to be pwd.
04:02 - There it goes, oh, whoa,
I'm in a weird place.
04:06 - Ah, clear, I'm going to
do cd.. clear so pretend
04:09 - that didn't happen, I
forgot I was demonstrating
04:11 - something earlier but
you might have gotten
04:13 - a little bit of taste there
04:15 - but I'm going to correct that,
scratch that, edit that out,
04:20 - it won't be edited out probably
but I'm going to type pwd.
04:23 - Pwd, look, here I am in Users/processing
04:28 - so this is the default
directory that terminal
04:31 - just sort of set me in originally.
04:32 - I can actually open
this directory directly
04:34 - in the finder by saying
open., open, the dot being
04:39 - this current directory,
open meaning opening.
04:41 - So if I wanted to open a
file, I could actually put
04:43 - the filename in here
but I want to just open
04:45 - this directory and you can
see now in the finder window
04:47 - what are the directories
here, applications,
04:50 - desktop, documents, downloads.
04:52 - If I were to now type ls,
list, you can see, look,
04:56 - it's listing all of those
here in terminal prompt.
04:58 - So this is just another
interface to your file system,
05:01 - the same way the finder on the Mac
05:04 - and the explorer on Windows is.
05:07 - So let's say I want to put some stuff on,
05:10 - work with some files on my desktop.
05:11 - I would type cd Desktopp
and I'm going to misspell it
05:15 - with two Ps and it should say,
05:17 - "No such file or directory exists."
05:20 - If I spell it correctly,
I should be there now.
05:23 - I didn't get any message
but I could say pwd
05:26 - and you can see now I have
changed to the desktop.
05:29 - Now, I'm going to show you a little trick.
05:32 - First of all, let's say I
want to go back a directory.
05:35 - .. will get me back a
directory so if I do cd..,
05:38 - now I'm up one directory
and I can see that for sure,
05:41 - /Users/processing.
05:43 - Now let's say I want to
change to the desktop
05:46 - but I don't really feel
like typing so much.
05:48 - If I type cd Des, I'm going
to hit a magical key now,
05:53 - tab is a magical key in the command line,
05:56 - and what it's going to
do, it's going to fill in
05:58 - the rest of that, now how did it know
06:00 - that I intended to type desktop?
06:02 - Well there's only so many things,
06:04 - there's only so many
options, there's only one
06:06 - that starts with De,
desktop, so tab is a way
06:08 - of auto filling in a filename
and I'm going to use that
06:10 - a lot as I do all sorts of stuff in git,
06:12 - hitting tab to auto fill
in, that's a quick way
06:15 - of doing things so now
I'm on the desktop again.
06:18 - Another trick is the up arrow,
up and down arrow allows you
06:22 - to browse through previous
commands so you can see here
06:25 - I'm hitting the up arrow
so if I wanted to find
06:27 - a command like this, I
could just find it again,
06:31 - hit enter and now I opened my desktop
06:33 - and you can see, these
are the various files
06:35 - that I have on my desktop and
you can see I actually have,
06:38 - this is foreshadowing,
this is a narrative device
06:40 - called foreshadowing, I have
this Rainbow-Poem folder
06:44 - which is actually my git
repository that I downloaded
06:46 - from GitHub which I'll
get to in the next video
06:49 - more about that.
06:51 - Okay I'm trying to think,
ah, here's something else
06:52 - that you really want to do.
06:55 - So let's say you want to
activate a current directory
06:57 - in terminal that is somewhere
deep in your computer.
07:01 - So I'm going to go back to
the finder and I'm going to go
07:06 - to documents and I'm going
to find data APIs, JSON3.
07:12 - So this is some old example that I made
07:14 - in some previous video tutorial.
07:15 - Let's say I wanted terminal
to point to that directory.
07:17 - Well it's /Documents/data_APIs/
so a lot to remember.
07:23 - So something that I can
do is I can type cd space
07:26 - and now I can just take
this folder and drag it
07:30 - into the terminal window
and let go and you can see
07:34 - it's going to auto fill in the
path so I can now hit enter,
07:37 - I can say pwd, I can say
ls and I can see that now.
07:41 - One thing I'll show you about
ls that sometimes I need
07:43 - is I can also do ls -all so Unix commands
07:47 - can be often modified with arguments.
07:49 - This is one argument,
-all, which will give me
07:53 - more information about
those files and you can see
07:56 - it's giving me information about,
07:57 - this is file permissions,
the date, the size,
07:59 - which user has control over this file,
08:02 - all that sort of stuff so
you know, in this case,
08:04 - hidden files will show up this way,
08:06 - that's not something you're
going to need all the time
08:08 - but it is particularly,
can be rather useful.
08:11 - So this is the basics, this
is all I really need to do
08:13 - because ultimately if I
want to execute git commands
08:16 - with a particular set of
files, I just need my terminal
08:22 - to be in that directory so
for example, if the directory,
08:25 - as I know, it will be
and this is kind of going
08:28 - into the next video, is
this Rainbow-Poem folder
08:31 - on the desktop, I will
just want to type cd,
08:34 - drag it over, hit enter,
type pwd to confirm
08:39 - and now you'll see, I am now
ready to execute git commands
08:41 - on the git repository that is
in this Rainbow-Poem folder.
08:46 - All right, so I hope
you enjoyed this video
08:48 - about basic Unix stuff
that you need for doing git
08:51 - and commands via the
locally on your computer
08:55 - and in the next video I'm going to move on
08:57 - to actually showing you those git commands
08:59 - and how they differ and
how you work with GitHub
09:01 - and all the stuff that
I'm going to get to.
09:02 - Okay, thanks again.

Hello, this is part 5, or actually part 5A of my Git and GitHub tutorial series.
