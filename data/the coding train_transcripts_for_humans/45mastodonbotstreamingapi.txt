With timestamps:

00:00 - (bell dinging)
00:02 - - Hello, all right.
00:03 - (scoffs)
00:04 - I'm still working with Mastadon
00:06 - and what I'm going to do in this video now
00:08 - is I'm going to take the
sample bot that I made
00:12 - and instead of just on a timer,
00:14 - every 24 hours, every 60 minutes,
00:16 - I happen to post something.
00:17 - I toot.
00:18 - What I'm going to do is I'm
going to use the streaming API.
00:22 - The streaming API is a way for me to,
00:24 - in real time, listen for events.
00:27 - And the particular kind of events
00:29 - that I'm going to listen for
00:31 - are what's known as user events.
00:33 - So a user event, and we'll
see all the different kinds
00:35 - any time that I might get a notification
00:37 - or somebody that I follow
might post something
00:39 - or anytime that I might...
00:41 - Anyway, there's lot of things
that come in, user events.
00:43 - And these are the good ones to use
00:45 - because if you're using
your user event as a bot,
00:48 - you're sort of making sure
that your bot only engages
00:50 - with people who are opting in.
00:51 - And this is pretty important.
00:52 - You don't want your bot just
randomly spamming people
00:55 - and favoriting random things
00:57 - or replying to random people
who haven't really asked
00:58 - to engage with your bot.
01:00 - So you're going to want to make sure
01:01 - that your bot follows the code of conduct
01:03 - and the terms of service of bots in space.
01:05 - I'll show you where you could find that.
01:07 - But typically, a good
way to think about it
01:09 - is if somebody is at mentioning the bot,
01:11 - then you're welcome to reply to them.
01:13 - If somebody follows you,
then you're also welcome
01:15 - to engage with that person
as the bot programmer.
01:18 - Okay, so let's go over and
look at the streaming API.
01:20 - So before I start using the streaming API,
01:23 - let me just point out to
read the information page
01:26 - with the code of conduct and
also the terms of service
01:29 - if you're choosing to post
your bot on botsin.space.
01:32 - You're going to want to make
sure you follow the rules
01:34 - of the space.
01:35 - Okay, now, what I'm going to do
01:38 - is I am going to start
using the streaming API.
01:41 - So the way that I do that,
01:42 - and we can find it here.
01:43 - Remember this is the node
package that I'm using,
01:45 - mastadon-api.
01:46 - And this is basically what I want to do.
01:48 - I want to create a listener
01:50 - and whenever there is a message,
01:52 - I want to take a look and do stuff.
01:56 - Act upon that message.
01:57 - So let's actually do exactly this.
01:59 - I'm going to keep the
error one in here as well.
02:00 - I'm just going to copy, paste this
02:03 - into my code.
02:07 - I'm going to comment out
this auto-posting thing
02:10 - that I had before about
the meaning of life.
02:13 - I'm just going to put this here.
02:15 - And actually, what I want to do now
02:17 - is I want to use my little trick.
02:19 - Instead of just console
logging the message,
02:21 - if you remember a little trick I did
02:23 - in the previous video,
02:25 - is I used write file.
02:30 - So I'm going to write files out
02:32 - so I can look at what kind
of messages I'm getting.
02:34 - Oops, (screaming) where have I gone?
02:37 - And so let me un-comment this out.
02:39 - I do want to put, like,
a timestamp also here.
02:45 - So it makes sense for me to say, like,
02:47 - data and then, actually,
02:51 - the message probably has
a timestamp built into it
02:54 - but I can also, javascript, timestamp.
02:58 - I think it's just like new date, get time.
03:01 - Yeah, so I can say new date, get time.
03:06 - I think this is right.
03:08 - Again, you can put with template literals,
03:10 - I can put a whole string...
03:13 - A whole line of code to evaluate,
03:14 - in essence, inside that area.
03:16 - So let's see if this works.
03:18 - I don't know what's going to happen.
03:22 - Let me see.
03:22 - Am I in the right place?
03:23 - No, sorry, I made a new folder
03:25 - so I'm going to release
these examples separately.
03:28 - I'm going to run this bot.
03:30 - And now, okay.
03:32 - I don't know if it's working
03:33 - because I don't know if I've
gotten any notifications yet.
03:35 - Maybe somebody watching this live
03:37 - is going to favorite something
or at mention my bot.
03:40 - That would be nice, right?
03:41 - And then something would
come in through here.
03:43 - Oh, I did get a message from somebody
03:45 - but I made some sort of mistake.
03:48 - Data is not defined.
03:50 - Okay.
03:51 - Because, oh yes.
03:53 - The variable name is MSG for message
03:57 - which is why I was thinking that, I guess.
03:59 - So it should be MSG here.
04:01 - Let's try this again.
04:04 - And actually, I'm just
going to take this out
04:06 - and I'm just going to write
console, dot log, user event.
04:13 - All right everybody.
04:14 - Are you watching?
04:15 - Are you giving me some user events?
04:16 - Here we go.
04:21 - Waiting for my user events.
04:23 - (sped up techno music)
04:26 - Okay.
04:27 - I think that was enough user events.
04:29 - Thank you very much.
04:30 - Let's go back and we can see here
04:33 - that I have all of these
data, dot json files
04:35 - for all of these events.
04:36 - So I can kind of click through them
04:37 - and see what kind of events.
04:39 - I'm hoping that the kind
people of the internet
04:41 - are not spamming me with horrible things.
04:45 - The first kind of event we
go here is a follow event.
04:48 - So if the event is a
notification of type follow,
04:51 - we can act on that.
04:52 - So let's do that.
04:53 - Let's say...
04:55 - Let's go back to our code.
04:57 - And I'm going to say...
04:59 - Right here.
05:00 - I'm going to not write these out anymore.
05:08 - If message dot, what was it again?
05:12 - Message, dot event equals notification
05:20 - and I think there's going
to be different kinds
05:22 - of notifications so I'm going to say
05:23 - if message, dot data,
05:28 - dot type, follow,
05:34 - then what I want to do is
I want to get the username.
05:38 - Let me get the username
05:42 - and that would be where?
05:44 - It would be, ah, right there.
05:46 - And actually, I want the account.
05:48 - The username is useful
05:49 - but you always, on Mastadon,
need both the username
05:51 - and the instance, the
address or the instance.
05:54 - The host name.
05:55 - Let me grab account equals
message, dot data, dot account.
06:03 - And then the other
thing that I pretty sure
06:05 - that I need is the ID, maybe.
06:07 - Seven, six, seven, zero.
06:08 - That's the account ID.
06:09 - This is the...
06:10 - I don't know if this the
ID of the event, I guess?
06:13 - So I want that account ID.
06:15 - So I'm going to say
constant ID equals message,
06:17 - dot data, dot ID.
06:21 - Oh!
06:21 - Dot account.
06:22 - I forgot about account.
06:23 - Message, dot data, dot account, dot ID.
06:26 - Dot account, and then dot account, dot ID
06:32 - and then I want to send a message.
06:34 - So how do I do that?
06:35 - Just with this nice M, dot post.
06:39 - So there's the thing.
06:39 - Maybe I want to make this, quote-unquote,
06:43 - toot function a bit more generic
06:45 - and I'm just going to give it...
06:48 - I'm going to pass in a status.
06:51 - So I'm going to get rid of
the random number stuff,
06:52 - which was from before.
06:54 - And then I'm going to just put...
06:59 - It's a little confusing
07:00 - but I'm going to take whatever I pass in
07:02 - and then here is...
07:05 - And then I'm going to post that.
07:07 - Now I have a function that
I can basically say, toot.
07:14 - Then I can say...
07:16 - I'm going to use at, data dot...
07:21 - Message, dot data, dot account.
07:24 - This is me referencing the
person that followed me.
07:30 - Thank you for the follow.
07:32 - I'll just say, "Choo, choo.
07:34 - "Welcome aboard."
07:35 - That's a train theme, welcome aboard.
07:39 - So we can see it'll say welcome aboard.
07:40 - Now here's the thing.
07:43 - I really should also...
07:45 - If I go back to the API.
07:48 - This one.
07:49 - I should probably say in reply...
07:51 - And that's a reply to the...
07:52 - Actually I don't need...
07:54 - It's not in reply to a specific status
07:56 - so this is actually fine.
07:57 - I think as long as they
at mention that, I'm done.
07:59 - So let me go.
08:01 - I've lost my code.
08:03 - I think I'm good.
08:06 - I think that I have everything I want.
08:10 - Let me just put the listen on air up here.
08:13 - So I'm listening for a message.
08:14 - If the message is a
notification of a follow
08:17 - then I will toot back to the person,
08:20 - their account name and say welcome aboard.
08:23 - Let's see how this goes.
08:26 - I look forward to all of you now.
08:29 - You can unfollow and follow
if you already followed.
08:31 - Let me run it first.
08:32 - And here we go.
08:34 - Oh, okay, I'm at status, status.
08:36 - I have a mistake here.
08:38 - I'm going to just change
this variable name to TXT.
08:42 - Or content.
08:43 - Let me make it content.
08:45 - I don't like having the
same name everywhere.
08:47 - It's confusing.
08:48 - But there should be no
semicolon after there.
08:50 - Okay, here we go.
08:54 - (instrumental elevator music)
09:02 - Welcome aboard!
09:06 - Welcome aboard.
09:09 - Welcome aboard.
09:18 - Okay, so you can see a bunch came in
09:20 - and now I can go back here
09:23 - and I can go to here
09:26 - and we can see, look at this.
09:27 - These are all the people who have now...
09:29 - And if I click there we can see...
09:31 - It's showing me and going
to these people's accounts.
09:34 - Yay!
09:35 - So we now have a bot
that responds to follows.
09:39 - Alka from the chat pointed
out something here.
09:42 - What did I do?
09:42 - Oh, the whole point in
making this variable
09:45 - was so that I don't have
to write this all out here.
09:47 - I don't know why I did that.
09:48 - So I can just do this.
09:50 - This will make it much more readable.
09:51 - And actually don't need the
ID so I can take that out.
09:54 - So this is all I need.
09:55 - We are done.
09:56 - All right.
09:57 - So this is follow.
09:58 - Now... (knocking)
10:00 - I'm going to show you
something in the next video.
10:02 - I think I'm going to take a break
10:04 - and in the next video,
10:05 - I'm going to look for messages,
10:08 - the at mention the bot
10:09 - and then I'm going to have
that bot act on those,
10:11 - either reply to them or favorite
10:13 - or do something like that, okay?
10:14 - So that's what I'm going to do next.
10:15 - (bell dinging)
10:17 - (upbeat music)

Cleaned transcript:

(bell dinging) Hello, all right. (scoffs) I'm still working with Mastadon and what I'm going to do in this video now is I'm going to take the sample bot that I made and instead of just on a timer, every 24 hours, every 60 minutes, I happen to post something.
