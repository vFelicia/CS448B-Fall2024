00:04 - I forgot what I was going to say hi um
00:06 - steering behaviors this video is going
00:09 - to we're going to walk through our first
00:11 - we're going to make out an autonomous
00:12 - agent it's going to have a steering
00:13 - Behavior moded off of the work of Craig
00:15 - Reynolds and it's going to be very
00:16 - exciting so let's take a look we're
00:18 - going to start with a basic scenario
00:19 - let's say we have a vehicle which is
00:22 - represented by a triangle this vehicle
00:24 - has a velocity also in this vehicle's
00:26 - world is a target as represented by this
00:29 - Plus with a circle around it this is our
00:31 - Target the behavior we are choosing to
00:34 - simulate is seeking remember Reynolds
00:36 - says there each vehicle is going to
00:39 - follow three steps action
00:41 - selection steering and Locomotion
00:44 - Locomotion is just our physics engine
00:45 - we've got that um action selection we
00:48 - are the action we are selecting is seek
00:50 - this target so now we need to calculate
00:52 - the steering force and here we go we
00:54 - have a formula for that steering and
00:57 - this is like the greatest formula ever
00:59 - written in the I just love it it's so
01:01 - beautiful so simple and yet so powerful
01:06 - it's just like a happy formula look at
01:07 - that desire steering equals desired
01:09 - minus velocity I can do that it's
01:11 - subtraction right so we this is going to
01:13 - be our formula steering equals desired
01:15 - minus velocity here's the thing there is
01:17 - something a little more complex at play
01:19 - here and that is this desired desired
01:22 - desired velocity this means what when we
01:26 - go to calculate a steering Force we need
01:28 - to determine what is that vehicle's
01:30 - actual desired velocity and this can
01:33 - actually be quite a complicated thing to
01:36 - figure out fortunately for us in this
01:38 - scenario it's not going to be too hard
01:39 - so let's try to imagine for a second I
01:42 - desire to seek that Target what is my
01:44 - desired velocity let me think about that
01:46 - for a second okay I got
01:47 - it I just the target's over there I want
01:50 - to move in the target's direction as
01:52 - fast as possible so we could represent
01:54 - that as a vector by saying a vector that
01:57 - points from the location towards the
01:59 - target
02:00 - and what is the length of that Vector it
02:03 - is as fast as possible or something
02:05 - we're going to call maximum speed or Max
02:07 - Speed so one of the things we're making
02:09 - a new class in our code in our examples
02:13 - called vehicle and again we've just
02:15 - doing this is like some strange sopian
02:18 - like thing we're doing like let's just
02:19 - make the thing class over and over and
02:21 - over again this is just another mover
02:23 - another particle another thing whatever
02:24 - it is it's got location velocity
02:26 - acceleration but we're going to add two
02:29 - new param
02:30 - to our vehicles one is maximum
02:33 - speed and one is another one is maximum
02:37 - Force so um this is useful I mean
02:40 - there's lots of the these these
02:42 - parameters these values that are are
02:44 - going to allow us to really tweak the
02:46 - behavior of our system so maximum speed
02:48 - you can think of as a top speed like how
02:50 - fast is this thing able to go is it a
02:52 - race car versus a truck same maximum
02:55 - force is like how good at how good is it
02:57 - at turning um what's its handling car
03:00 - racing example is a perfect scenario for
03:01 - this hopefully you're thinking of some
03:03 - more creative use but car racing we have
03:05 - a car as a maximum speed and a handling
03:07 - that's what these variables are going to
03:08 - control but this is how we're going to
03:10 - scale calculate our desired velocity so
03:12 - once we have our desired velocity we
03:14 - need to apply a steering Force
03:17 - now deep breath and pause for a moment
03:20 - and stand over here and look at it from
03:22 - this direction we we did something like
03:24 - this several many videos back another
03:27 - time in our life in fact several times
03:29 - over we have looked at attraction
03:31 - behaviors what is an attraction Behavior
03:33 - it is when an object is attracted to
03:35 - some other object or in this case this
03:37 - thing that's moving is attracted to
03:38 - another location on the screen so with
03:41 - an attraction Behavior with a
03:42 - gravitational attraction or something
03:44 - you might have found a toxic lips we
03:45 - could have just sto there and said hey
03:47 - this Vector we made up that's the force
03:49 - that's going to point at the Target I
03:51 - mean that's the force that's going to be
03:52 - applied to the object but we're doing
03:54 - something more here remember I really
03:57 - want to write this down an a ton but I'm
03:59 - not going I'm just going to say it an
04:01 - autonomous agent has the as as a as a as
04:04 - an ability to perceive its environment
04:06 - to know more about its environment than
04:09 - just um than just sitting there and
04:11 - experiencing a force in other words it's
04:13 - able to look at its current velocity as
04:16 - it relates to its desired velocity and
04:19 - it's able to say like what's the error
04:21 - here what's the difference here that's
04:23 - the force it's able to compensate for
04:25 - how far off the path it already is going
04:27 - I mean think about it if your goal is to
04:29 - move as fast as possible to a Target
04:31 - over there and you're already moving as
04:33 - fast as possible to a Target over there
04:35 - why do you need to apply a force to
04:36 - yourself you don't if your velocity
04:38 - equals your desired velocity your
04:39 - steering Force has a net steering force
04:41 - of zero now okay so let's actually take
04:43 - a look at what the force looks like that
04:46 - we're now applying to this vehicle so
04:48 - let's let's do this um desired minus
04:51 - velocity so this is our desired velocity
04:53 - right here and remember when you add
04:56 - vectors you put them end to end so
04:57 - that's desired and now this is is our
04:59 - velocity if I were adding it I would put
05:01 - the velocity over here but to subtract
05:03 - it I just need to reverse the velocity's
05:05 - direction and put it and and point it
05:08 - the other direction so this is desired
05:11 - minus velocity and this is the resulting
05:13 - Vector that we get so you can see here
05:15 - that this is the actual force that we're
05:17 - applying which makes sense if we're
05:19 - already shooting in this direction we
05:20 - need to compensate back to steer towards
05:22 - that Target so this is kind of the power
05:25 - of this formula this formula says let me
05:28 - look at what it is I want to do let me
05:30 - look at it how I'm currently moving and
05:32 - let me apply a force to myself um which
05:34 - is the difference of those two so in
05:37 - this scenario pretty simple stuff but um
05:40 - as we're going to see when we start to
05:42 - look at flow field following and path
05:44 - following and flocking behaviors and all
05:46 - these other steering behaviors how we
05:48 - calculate that desired velocity is going
05:50 - to sometimes get a little bit harder
05:53 - okay so um let's kind of map this out a
05:56 - little bit um let's write let's let's
05:58 - sort of figure out a a little bit about
06:00 - how we're going to actually do this in
06:02 - Kota we're at six minutes which I think
06:03 - is pretty reasonable for a video we just
06:05 - have a few minutes more perhaps so I'm
06:08 - move the target a little bit closer so I
06:10 - have more space over here so let's just
06:13 - remind ourselves how this kind of
06:15 - calculation works with code right we
06:18 - know we we need to get um we need to
06:20 - calculate I erase that the steering
06:22 - Force ultimately is what we want to
06:23 - calculate but first we need to calculate
06:25 - that desired velocity so that we can
06:27 - calculate steering okay so how do we
06:29 - calculate that desired velocity first we
06:31 - just need to Vector the points from the
06:33 - location all the way to the Target how
06:35 - do we do
06:36 - that I'm going to say p Vector
06:39 - desired equals P Vector do subtract what
06:45 - Target minus
06:47 - location Target minus
06:51 - location now I have a vector that points
06:54 - all the way from here to there now I
06:56 - need to make its magnitude maximum speed
06:59 - this is so easy desired do set magnitude
07:04 - to max
07:06 - speed now behind the scenes What's
07:08 - Happening Here is that Vector gets
07:10 - normalized and then scaled normalized to
07:12 - a length of one multiplied by maximum
07:14 - speed to scale to maximum speed but here
07:16 - we have a a quick function in the
07:18 - processing P vector class set the
07:19 - magnitude at maximum speed once we have
07:22 - this now we just need to apply Reynold's
07:24 - brilliant formula P Vector
07:28 - steering equals P Vector do
07:33 - subtract what do we now want to subract
07:35 - desired minus
07:38 - velocity once we have that all we need
07:40 - to do is send that Force the resulting
07:43 - Force through our physics engine oh oh I
07:47 - forgot a I forgot a step so this is
07:49 - sending it through the this is
07:50 - calculating it this is sending it
07:51 - through the physics engine but we do
07:53 - want to add one little extra step here
07:56 - and that little extra step is saying hey
07:59 - this is not this perfect vehicle that
08:01 - can just steer however much it needs to
08:04 - steer that force that this force is
08:07 - magnitude is limited and so what the
08:09 - step that we're going to add here is say
08:11 - steering.
08:13 - limit maximum Force so we're putting
08:17 - some limits if that maximum force is
08:19 - very low it's kind of like a I'm really
08:21 - trying to turn I can't do it if that
08:23 - maximum force is very high I can turn on
08:25 - a dime really really fast so these
08:28 - variables as we're going to see in the
08:29 - code example maximum speed and maximum
08:31 - Force are really really key to tuning
08:34 - how your how your vehicle is going to
08:37 - behave all right so hopefully this
08:40 - scenario makes sense to you hopefully
08:42 - you now see how Reynold's formula is
08:45 - applied how it is that the crucial thing
08:47 - here is saying this vehicle has a goal
08:50 - that it it it wants to accomplish and
08:52 - that goal is translated to a desired
08:54 - velocity Vector once you have that you
08:56 - got R's formula you got a force and your
08:58 - vehicle's moving so let's take a look at
09:00 - how this actually happens in processing
09:02 - and I'll meet you over at camera 2 is
09:04 - that camera two I don't know maybe
09:06 - that's camera one there's only two
09:07 - cameras so I it's anyway hi um so here
09:10 - we've got the uh sketch excellent let's
09:13 - run it I hope I didn't like screw it up
09:15 - before um no it seems to be working so
09:18 - you can see here icept the fact that my
09:20 - head is in front of it this something I
09:21 - need to work on here I'm sure I can
09:23 - improve this okay so as I move the mouse
09:26 - around you can see that this vehicle is
09:27 - moving towards it you know it's not
09:29 - nothing too thrilling but it's it's an
09:31 - implementation of this Behavior what one
09:32 - thing it's interesting to see is hey
09:34 - it's always sort of flying past it then
09:36 - it has to turn around and come back this
09:38 - is something we're going to investigate
09:39 - in the next video when we start to look
09:41 - at an arriving Behavior what it means
09:42 - for that vehicle to slow down and stop
09:44 - when it reaches the target which is
09:46 - something I want to look at I think at
09:47 - this point in the next video although if
09:48 - you're looking for an exercise that
09:50 - might be something you try to implement
09:51 - just on your own come up with a scenario
09:53 - for that before you move on okay um so
09:57 - let's look at just a few key things in
09:58 - the code code here number one is here we
10:01 - have our vehicle class and you can see
10:02 - what I'm talking about we've added just
10:04 - a couple variables maximum speed and
10:06 - maximum force and not to overemphasize
10:08 - this point but um if I make that maximum
10:11 - Force really really large you can see
10:13 - how this vehicle now is able to just
10:15 - instantly turn and one of the things
10:17 - that we're that I want to emphasize here
10:19 - is that you know you have to ask
10:21 - yourself a question like why are you
10:22 - doing this in the first place is your
10:25 - goal to have something just move as fast
10:27 - as possible towards a Target if that
10:29 - your goal then maybe this kind then
10:31 - maybe you don't need all of this
10:32 - elaborate steering Force stuff you could
10:33 - just like set its velocity headed
10:35 - straight there the point of what we're
10:36 - doing is to create this kind of lifelike
10:38 - and improvisational movement and and the
10:40 - fact that we have these parameters
10:42 - maximum speed and maximum Force really
10:44 - allows us to have a wide range of
10:45 - possibilities or remodeling a cheetah or
10:47 - a turtle or a ant or a a tricycle I
10:53 - don't know there's so many possibilities
10:55 - and how these how how the system behaves
10:57 - you know can be can be AFF fed by these
10:59 - parameters and so um yeah so um so
11:02 - that's I think mostly all that I wanted
11:04 - to show you oh yeah let's just take a
11:06 - look and just prove the point that here
11:08 - we now have a function in our class
11:10 - which receives a Target we make our
11:14 - desired velocity which is Target minus
11:16 - location I did it in two steps here
11:18 - normalized in scale by maximum speed but
11:20 - actually we can just as we saw over here
11:22 - we can simplify that by saying set
11:25 - magnitude um and uh then we like the
11:29 - steering Force desired minus velocity
11:31 - limit it to maximum force and apply it
11:33 - so this is hopefully a kind of a good
11:36 - model it's a beginning First Step
11:38 - hopefully you can understand it see how
11:40 - it works you know your real project here
11:44 - is to come up with your you know why are
11:46 - you doing this what's your what are you
11:47 - building why are the things moving what
11:49 - are what are the goals of the elements
11:51 - in your system and how can you translate
11:53 - those goals into desired velocities so
11:55 - you might have some creative idea here
11:56 - that you're already ready to explore
11:58 - come up with your own Des way of
12:00 - calculating a desired velocity and then
12:01 - translate that into steering but if
12:03 - you're looking for an exercise in the
12:04 - next video I just said this we're going
12:06 - to change the desired velocity so that
12:09 - it slows down so that it's the closer
12:11 - it's to the Target the smaller it is
12:13 - that's the arrive bavor right when I'm
12:14 - close to the Target I desire to be
12:16 - moving very very slowly at that point so
12:18 - see if you can add that actually into
12:20 - this example and get it to slow down and
12:22 - stop at the Target in the next video I'm
12:24 - going to um talk through that um fairly
12:26 - briefly I think okay um this is this I
12:29 - was recording this whole time which is
12:31 - good and soon you will be watching this
12:34 - maybe and I I think okay

Cleaned transcript:

I forgot what I was going to say hi um steering behaviors this video is going to we're going to walk through our first we're going to make out an autonomous agent it's going to have a steering Behavior moded off of the work of Craig Reynolds and it's going to be very exciting so let's take a look we're going to start with a basic scenario let's say we have a vehicle which is represented by a triangle this vehicle has a velocity also in this vehicle's world is a target as represented by this Plus with a circle around it this is our Target the behavior we are choosing to simulate is seeking remember Reynolds says there each vehicle is going to follow three steps action selection steering and Locomotion Locomotion is just our physics engine we've got that um action selection we are the action we are selecting is seek this target so now we need to calculate the steering force and here we go we have a formula for that steering and this is like the greatest formula ever written in the I just love it it's so beautiful so simple and yet so powerful it's just like a happy formula look at that desire steering equals desired minus velocity I can do that it's subtraction right so we this is going to be our formula steering equals desired minus velocity here's the thing there is something a little more complex at play here and that is this desired desired desired velocity this means what when we go to calculate a steering Force we need to determine what is that vehicle's actual desired velocity and this can actually be quite a complicated thing to figure out fortunately for us in this scenario it's not going to be too hard so let's try to imagine for a second I desire to seek that Target what is my desired velocity let me think about that for a second okay I got it I just the target's over there I want to move in the target's direction as fast as possible so we could represent that as a vector by saying a vector that points from the location towards the target and what is the length of that Vector it is as fast as possible or something we're going to call maximum speed or Max Speed so one of the things we're making a new class in our code in our examples called vehicle and again we've just doing this is like some strange sopian like thing we're doing like let's just make the thing class over and over and over again this is just another mover another particle another thing whatever it is it's got location velocity acceleration but we're going to add two new param to our vehicles one is maximum speed and one is another one is maximum Force so um this is useful I mean there's lots of the these these parameters these values that are are going to allow us to really tweak the behavior of our system so maximum speed you can think of as a top speed like how fast is this thing able to go is it a race car versus a truck same maximum force is like how good at how good is it at turning um what's its handling car racing example is a perfect scenario for this hopefully you're thinking of some more creative use but car racing we have a car as a maximum speed and a handling that's what these variables are going to control but this is how we're going to scale calculate our desired velocity so once we have our desired velocity we need to apply a steering Force now deep breath and pause for a moment and stand over here and look at it from this direction we we did something like this several many videos back another time in our life in fact several times over we have looked at attraction behaviors what is an attraction Behavior it is when an object is attracted to some other object or in this case this thing that's moving is attracted to another location on the screen so with an attraction Behavior with a gravitational attraction or something you might have found a toxic lips we could have just sto there and said hey this Vector we made up that's the force that's going to point at the Target I mean that's the force that's going to be applied to the object but we're doing something more here remember I really want to write this down an a ton but I'm not going I'm just going to say it an autonomous agent has the as as a as a as an ability to perceive its environment to know more about its environment than just um than just sitting there and experiencing a force in other words it's able to look at its current velocity as it relates to its desired velocity and it's able to say like what's the error here what's the difference here that's the force it's able to compensate for how far off the path it already is going I mean think about it if your goal is to move as fast as possible to a Target over there and you're already moving as fast as possible to a Target over there why do you need to apply a force to yourself you don't if your velocity equals your desired velocity your steering Force has a net steering force of zero now okay so let's actually take a look at what the force looks like that we're now applying to this vehicle so let's let's do this um desired minus velocity so this is our desired velocity right here and remember when you add vectors you put them end to end so that's desired and now this is is our velocity if I were adding it I would put the velocity over here but to subtract it I just need to reverse the velocity's direction and put it and and point it the other direction so this is desired minus velocity and this is the resulting Vector that we get so you can see here that this is the actual force that we're applying which makes sense if we're already shooting in this direction we need to compensate back to steer towards that Target so this is kind of the power of this formula this formula says let me look at what it is I want to do let me look at it how I'm currently moving and let me apply a force to myself um which is the difference of those two so in this scenario pretty simple stuff but um as we're going to see when we start to look at flow field following and path following and flocking behaviors and all these other steering behaviors how we calculate that desired velocity is going to sometimes get a little bit harder okay so um let's kind of map this out a little bit um let's write let's let's sort of figure out a a little bit about how we're going to actually do this in Kota we're at six minutes which I think is pretty reasonable for a video we just have a few minutes more perhaps so I'm move the target a little bit closer so I have more space over here so let's just remind ourselves how this kind of calculation works with code right we know we we need to get um we need to calculate I erase that the steering Force ultimately is what we want to calculate but first we need to calculate that desired velocity so that we can calculate steering okay so how do we calculate that desired velocity first we just need to Vector the points from the location all the way to the Target how do we do that I'm going to say p Vector desired equals P Vector do subtract what Target minus location Target minus location now I have a vector that points all the way from here to there now I need to make its magnitude maximum speed this is so easy desired do set magnitude to max speed now behind the scenes What's Happening Here is that Vector gets normalized and then scaled normalized to a length of one multiplied by maximum speed to scale to

forgot a I forgot a step so this is sending it through the this is calculating it this is sending it through the physics engine but we do want to add one little extra step here and that little extra step is saying hey this is not this perfect vehicle that can just steer however much it needs to steer that force that this force is magnitude is limited and so what the step that we're going to add here is say steering. limit maximum Force so we're putting some limits if that maximum force is very low it's kind of like a I'm really trying to turn I can't do it if that maximum force is very high I can turn on a dime really really fast so these variables as we're going to see in the code example maximum speed and maximum Force are really really key to tuning how your how your vehicle is going to behave all right so hopefully this scenario makes sense to you hopefully you now see how Reynold's formula is applied how it is that the crucial thing here is saying this vehicle has a goal that it it it wants to accomplish and that goal is translated to a desired velocity Vector once you have that you got R's formula you got a force and your vehicle's moving so let's take a look at how this actually happens in processing and I'll meet you over at camera 2 is that camera two I don't know maybe that's camera one there's only two cameras so I it's anyway hi um so here we've got the uh

things in the code code here number one is here we have our vehicle class and you can see what I'm talking about we've added just a couple variables maximum speed and maximum force and not to overemphasize this point but um if I make that maximum Force really really large you can see how this vehicle now is able to just instantly turn and one of the things that we're that I want to emphasize here is that you know you have to ask yourself a question like why are you doing this in the first place is your goal to have something just move as fast as possible towards a Target if that your goal then maybe this kind then maybe you don't need all of this elaborate steering Force stuff you could just like set its velocity headed straight there the point of what we're doing is to create this kind of lifelike and improvisational movement and and the fact that we have these parameters maximum speed and maximum Force really allows us to have a wide range of possibilities or remodeling a cheetah or a turtle or a ant or a a tricycle I don't know there's so many possibilities and how these how how the system behaves you know can be can be AFF fed by these parameters and so um yeah so um so that's I think mostly all that I wanted to show you oh yeah let's just take a look and just prove the point that here we now have a function in our class which receives a Target we make our desired velocity which is Target minus location I did it in two steps here normalized in scale by maximum speed but actually we can just as we saw over here we can simplify that by saying set magnitude um and uh then we like the steering Force desired minus velocity limit it to maximum force and apply it so this is hopefully a kind of a good model it's a beginning First Step hopefully you can understand it see how it works you know your real project here is to come up with your you know why are you doing this what's your what are you building why are the things moving what are what are the goals of the elements in your system and how can you translate those goals into desired velocities so you might have some creative idea here that you're already ready to explore come up with your own Des way of calculating a desired velocity and then translate that into steering but if you're looking for an exercise in the next video I just said this we're going to change the desired velocity so that it slows down so that it's the closer it's to the Target the smaller it is that's the arrive bavor right when I'm close to the Target I desire to be moving very very slowly at that point so see if you can add that actually into this example and get it to slow down and stop at the Target in the next video I'm going to um talk through that um fairly briefly I think okay um this is this I was recording this whole time which is good and soon you will be watching this maybe and I I think okay
