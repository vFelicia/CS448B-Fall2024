00:00 - pop-up this is another video I just
00:02 - thought of that right now
00:03 - oh I'm not genius when it comes to bad
00:07 - jokes on the internet and I also think
00:09 - like I hurt my back the other day anyway
00:11 - here I am in another video about popups
00:14 - in Chrome extension so in the previous
00:15 - video all I showed you how to do was if
00:18 - you add a browser action with a button
00:21 - when you click that button you can have
00:24 - a web page pop-up and in this case I
00:26 - have an entire p5.js sketch animating as
00:29 - part of the pop-up but why would I want
00:32 - to have a pop-up well one of the reasons
00:34 - why I would want to have a pop-up is to
00:36 - provide an interface for my Chrome
00:38 - extension that might change some
00:39 - settings to have some place where I
00:41 - could enter some information to to show
00:43 - something related to what's on the web
00:46 - page that I'm on so in order for that to
00:48 - actually happen I need to have some way
00:52 - of communicating between the content and
00:55 - the pop-up now one thing that's
00:59 - important about Chrome extension I
01:02 - haven't actually used the word scope but
01:04 - I think it's to mention this before when
01:07 - I wanted to communicate between the
01:09 - background script and the content script
01:11 - they live in different scopes each one
01:14 - of these things lives in its own bubble
01:17 - the background script the pop-up the
01:20 - background script the pop-up the content
01:22 - script all in their own separate bubble
01:25 - so only the content script is allowed to
01:30 - mess around and know about what's on the
01:32 - content page
01:34 - the pop-up knows nothing about that and
01:37 - it's not as if you could just make a
01:39 - global variable and use the same
01:40 - variable in both places there different
01:42 - scopes there's sort of a trick to
01:45 - getting variables from the background
01:46 - script but that's another story now so
01:49 - what do you I need to do is I need to
01:52 - have a way of sending messages back and
01:54 - forth in very similar to how you might
01:56 - do this in a networked application I
01:58 - have this thing running over here and
02:00 - this thing running over the area I'm
02:01 - going to send a message over here to
02:02 - make this thing happen that's what he
02:03 - did to do the nice thing is the API the
02:05 - set of functions that I showed in a
02:07 - previous video for how to communicate
02:09 - from the background script to the
02:11 - content script
02:12 - I can use that same functionality to
02:14 - communicate from the pop-up to the
02:15 - content script so what I think I'm gonna
02:17 - try to do let's come back over here is
02:19 - first time to get rid of this maze thing
02:22 - it's kind of interesting but I'm gonna
02:23 - I'm gonna go into my p5 sketch I'm just
02:26 - gonna kind of delete everything and I'm
02:29 - just gonna say function setup and
02:32 - function draw and I'm gonna I'm gonna
02:36 - say no canvas and I'm going to put some
02:42 - elements on the page like I don't need
02:44 - this anymore I don't need this sound
02:46 - library oh that's interesting that I
02:47 - could have sounds I'm gonna put some
02:50 - elements on the page so I'm gonna say
02:51 - [Music]
02:53 - type paragraph replacer and then I'm
03:00 - going to make an input element with an
03:03 - ID called user input I know is that how
03:08 - you do it
03:10 - do I need to close it like that or just
03:12 - put a slash on the end something like
03:13 - that I'm gonna put that in like a
03:14 - paragraph then what I'm gonna do oh
03:20 - let's see this this this looks weird but
03:23 - I feel like I messed something up here
03:24 - but I'm just gonna leave it then what
03:26 - I'm going to do is I'm going to reload
03:29 - my extension and I'm gonna press the
03:31 - pop-up actually okay so now I have this
03:34 - paragraph replacer what I want to do is
03:36 - anything I type here I'm going to
03:38 - replace the content on the web page with
03:41 - anything I type there just as a
03:42 - demonstration of how you can communicate
03:44 - between the two and remember I could
03:46 - send from the content script so one
03:48 - thing I might like to do for example is
03:50 - I actually have an example so I'll link
03:52 - to that from here is what if I'm on a
03:54 - web page and I like select a word and
03:56 - then I press this I'm gonna make do this
03:59 - as a coding challenge so I select a word
04:02 - on the web page I press the button and
04:04 - it goes to an API like word Nick and
04:06 - finds me the definition for that page so
04:08 - we'll do that as a coding challenge in
04:10 - maybe that in the next video actually
04:11 - but in this video I'm going to do
04:12 - something simple and I just need to have
04:14 - this messaging go back and forth so how
04:18 - do I do that first let me just weirdly
04:20 - make sure messaging works and I'm going
04:23 - to
04:24 - actually no no let's I don't need to
04:27 - draw look there's no animation happening
04:29 - you could have an animation what I want
04:31 - to do is I want to say user input equals
04:35 - select so I'm using the p5 Dom library
04:38 - to grab that element and then and that
04:42 - says user put user input then I want to
04:44 - use the user input dot input there are
04:48 - two events that can be associated with a
04:51 - textbox one is the event called changed
04:53 - which only happens when I like press
04:57 - enter or tab out of that could maybe
05:00 - have a submit button or something but
05:01 - I'm actually just gonna do it as I'm
05:03 - typing so the input event is an event
05:05 - that happens every time I press a key so
05:08 - I'm gonna say pressed you know user key
05:12 - pressed oh boy terrible name for a
05:15 - function I can't even tolerate it new
05:18 - text will call this new text so I'm
05:20 - gonna write a function called new text
05:22 - and here now I want to send a message to
05:28 - the content script so all I'm gonna do
05:32 - now to make sure this is working is send
05:34 - a message with what's in like this is
05:37 - the message user input value so whatever
05:42 - is in that text input box that's going
05:44 - to be the message so I content script
05:48 - actually a hole ready has code to
05:53 - receive a message it already has code to
05:55 - receive a message because that's what I
05:56 - had in a previous example and actually
05:58 - don't need to change it I do need to
06:01 - think about how I'm gonna format that
06:02 - message my background script that I did
06:04 - in a previous video has the code to send
06:06 - a message this is how I send a message
06:11 - now the thing is how do I get the
06:14 - current tabs ID so this isn't gonna work
06:19 - exactly let me move this into here the
06:23 - idea that I'm gonna do here is right now
06:25 - I'm gonna craft the message as a
06:27 - JavaScript object then I'm gonna send
06:30 - that message to the tabs that tab that
06:32 - I'm currently on I could actually send
06:34 - it to other tabs
06:35 - but if I send it to the tab that I'm
06:36 - currently on how do I get the tab that
06:38 - I'm currently on okay so what I need to
06:41 - look at is the chrome tabs package I
06:45 - don't have packages the right thing to
06:47 - say the API and that's here so extension
06:50 - slash tabs this is a set of functions
06:53 - that I can employ to sort of figure out
06:55 - about the tabs so one thing I can do is
06:57 - just probably get current is all I need
06:59 - that I actually in some of my examples I
07:01 - noticed I'm using this query to like
07:03 - query about all the tabs but I think all
07:05 - I need to do is say get current so get
07:07 - current just gets the current tab which
07:10 - is what I want so I am going to say
07:14 - first ready to do is say chrome tabs get
07:21 - current and a got tab so I need another
07:24 - callback and not getting into this sort
07:27 - of like crazy nested callback stuff
07:29 - which I really want to try to avoid and
07:33 - some of the new arrow syntax and other
07:36 - promises stuff I'll get into that at
07:39 - some point kind of but I think this is
07:41 - fine so right the user presses a key new
07:44 - text and someone suggested that I call
07:46 - this change text which I think is better
07:49 - then as soon as that happens I want to
07:51 - say which is the tab which the current
07:54 - tab so you need to get the current tab
07:56 - once I've got the current tab it should
07:59 - be the actual current tab is passed into
08:01 - my callback as an argument so once I do
08:04 - that I could just send the message to
08:06 - that particular tab I'm going to send
08:08 - the message hello right I'm not actually
08:10 - doing anything of value yet and send
08:12 - that message hello and let's see what
08:13 - happens so now let's go and oh and let
08:17 - me in the content script console I'm
08:20 - console logging the message so I'm
08:22 - actually just gonna console log the
08:24 - whole message so we should see that in
08:26 - the content script so what I'm gonna do
08:27 - is I'm going to reload my extension I'm
08:31 - gonna go over here to this page I'm
08:33 - going to open up the JavaScript console
08:35 - and when I do this I don't see anything
08:39 - yet
08:40 - but as soon as I start typing in that
08:42 - paragraph I should see here the message
08:44 - coming through
08:53 - that didn't work so let's look at
08:56 - inspector let's inspect this element
08:58 - let's look at the console Oh tabs dot
09:02 - get current cannot read property idea of
09:05 - undefined so you might need permissions
09:12 - ah so thank you breaking news from the
09:14 - chat firs I'll Simon Thank You Simon
09:17 - suggested that I call it change text and
09:19 - I probably need to add anytime you start
09:23 - to use something from the chrome API I
09:26 - need to explicitly say in my manifesto
09:28 - JSON that I intend to use this so I
09:31 - don't know if this is if that's the
09:34 - problem but we're gonna have to figure
09:35 - this out so one thing that it could be
09:38 - is that I need to go to my manifest.json
09:41 - and add something like permissions is
09:44 - permissions already in here no
09:46 - permissions and this should be maybe an
09:52 - array it's an array I think and it has
09:58 - tabs is one of my permissions so this
10:02 - could be the thing that fixes it let's
10:04 - try it I kind of think that I might have
10:06 - done something else wrong but let's try
10:08 - some and reload this I'm going to reload
10:11 - this open up here
10:19 - good work either I really just way too
10:22 - in love with my sound in fact somebody
10:24 - should probably I probably need an
10:25 - intervention about that all right so
10:27 - that was not the air here I'm gonna
10:30 - think about this a little bit do you
10:32 - know what's good to do read the
10:35 - documentation gets the tab that this
10:38 - script call is being made from maybe
10:41 - undefined if called from a non tab
10:43 - context for example a background page or
10:50 - that's the worst just just or pop up
10:54 - view so that's definitely the problem
10:56 - and that's probably why what I actually
10:58 - did in one of my examples is used query
11:01 - so let's let's use query so let's try
11:07 - using query so I'm gonna change this to
11:08 - saying I'm gonna go back to my content
11:12 - scrub where am I in the where am I
11:16 - looking in the pop up yeah in the pop up
11:18 - I'm gonna change this to chrome tabs
11:20 - query and what I need to do if I'm going
11:23 - to run query is I need to give it some
11:25 - parameters for the query like I need to
11:28 - I want it says optional but I want like
11:31 - all of the active tabs and I want I
11:37 - think it's only active or current window
11:40 - and current window I might not need
11:43 - these but I recall doing this in a
11:45 - previous example so but you it's up to
11:48 - you to read this documentation to see
11:50 - what tabs you want returned so I need
11:54 - that so now I can query for all of those
11:57 - tabs this is now I want to say got tabs
11:59 - because what I'm gonna do is get an
12:00 - array of tabs I know that the query
12:02 - function probably if I look at the
12:04 - documentation it explains gets all the
12:07 - tabs that have the specified properties
12:09 - there might be a way for me to just get
12:11 - only the current tab but I'm pretty sure
12:14 - that tabs index 0 is the tab that I want
12:19 - so let's try this now I think we're in
12:21 - good shape here I'm gonna go over here
12:24 - and I'm going to say reload the
12:26 - extension
12:27 - I'm gonna come over here press the
12:33 - pop-up Oh seriously how could that not
12:40 - have worked let's look at the tabs I'm
12:43 - gonna say got tabs and let's console.log
12:49 - it and now let's try this again
12:56 - to reload the extension I'm gonna not
12:58 - use my ridiculous sound effects anymore
13:00 - because I'm overdoing it I'm gonna
13:02 - reload the extension I'm gonna press
13:04 - this oh of course now it works I
13:07 - probably just like missed clicking save
13:09 - or reload or something anyway so I think
13:12 - it actually did work but that's how you
13:14 - would have debug it if it hadn't worked
13:17 - weirdly enough I like behind by one
13:19 - reload right because now I'm not seeing
13:22 - my messages save am I not like saving in
13:28 - the right it's like behind by one reload
13:30 - let's reload let's refresh I made the
13:40 - classic error I'm looking for all of my
13:42 - messages here only the content script
13:44 - messages will be there if I want to see
13:47 - the pop-up messages they are here so
13:50 - that is working it's an array it's this
13:54 - is the information I got lots of
13:55 - information as an incognito tab what URL
13:57 - is it on what's the width you can see
13:59 - there's lots of information that you can
14:01 - get all right we're in good shape let's
14:02 - move a little bit more quickly here just
14:04 - to finish this off so what I actually
14:06 - want to do is I want to send what I want
14:10 - to send is what was it called I called
14:13 - it user input user input value and what
14:18 - I want to do in the content script is
14:21 - rather than change the background color
14:24 - I'm going to change the inner HTML I
14:30 - think that's what I write to message dot
14:35 - text and I don't I'm not going to bother
14:37 - to check if it's a certain method
14:39 - there's only one kind of message I can
14:41 - so as long as I've gotten a message
14:43 - change whatever the paragraph text to
14:45 - that message okay here we go I'm feeling
14:48 - good about this I think this is gonna
14:49 - work and I'm going to reload the
14:53 - extension I'm going to refresh this page
14:56 - it's got some paragraphs on it I'm gonna
15:00 - feel confident enough to actually close
15:03 - the JavaScript console I'm going to open
15:06 - this up and now here we go all right I
15:15 - should have closed anything let's try
15:18 - this again let's look it let's look here
15:24 - Oh would I put this damn I go in there
15:26 - probably all of you noticed this and
15:27 - you've had to watch like an extra two
15:29 - minutes of this video it could edit out
15:32 - this mistake but probably gonna leave it
15:33 - in let's try this one more time
15:39 - reload extension and open Oh No and now
15:47 - press this now I'm going to type into
15:49 - the paragraph release this dot style is
15:59 - not relevant
16:00 - I had dot South and I was changing the
16:02 - background color inner HTML is not a
16:04 - part of the style it's just part of
16:06 - elements itself so I think it's gonna
16:11 - work this time
16:12 - I've corrected this everything's good
16:15 - here in terms of my syntax let's try
16:18 - this one more time okay here we go I am
16:22 - now going to reload the extension
16:29 - refresh the page press this button and
16:33 - start typing yeah look whatever I type
16:37 - into here now goes into every single
16:39 - paragraph element on the page this
16:42 - worked
16:43 - exclamation point thank you thank you
16:48 - very much so this has been the end of
16:50 - this sending a message from a pop-up to
16:54 - the
16:54 - Paige and I'm gonna do a coding
16:56 - challenge which you'll find at some
16:57 - point when I publish it where I'm going
16:59 - to actually take content from the page
17:00 - and display information while querying
17:02 - an API information about it there so I'm
17:06 - gonna do that in a coding challenge soon
17:08 - thanks for watching
17:09 - [Music]
17:16 - you

popup this is another video I just thought of that right now oh I'm not genius when it comes to bad jokes on the internet and I also think like I hurt my back the other day anyway here I am in another video about popups in Chrome extension so in the previous video all I showed you how to do was if you add a browser action with a button when you click that button you can have a web page popup and in this case I have an entire p5.js sketch animating as part of the popup but why would I want to have a popup well one of the reasons why I would want to have a popup is to provide an interface for my

then as soon as that happens I want to say which is the tab which the current tab so you need to get the current tab once I've got the current tab it should be the actual current tab is passed into my callback as an argument so once I do that I could just send the message to that particular tab I'm going to send the message hello right I'm not actually doing anything of value yet and send that message hello and let's see what happens so now let's go and oh and let me in the content script console I'm console logging the message so I'm actually just gonna console log the whole message so we should see that in the content script so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to reload my extension I'm gonna go over here to this page I'm going to open up the JavaScript console and when I do this I don't see anything yet but as soon as I start typing in that paragraph I should see here the message coming through that didn't work so let's look at inspector let's inspect this element let's look at the console Oh tabs dot get current cannot read property idea of undefined so you might need permissions ah so thank you breaking news from the chat firs I'll Simon Thank You Simon suggested that I call it change text and I probably need to add anytime you start to use something from the chrome API I need to explicitly say in my manifesto JSON that I intend to use this so I don't know if this is if that's the problem but we're gonna have to figure this out so one thing that it could be is that I need to go to my manifest.json and add something like permissions is permissions already in here no permissions and this should be maybe an array it's an array I think and it has tabs is one of my permissions so this could be the thing that fixes it let's try it I kind of think that I might have done something else wrong but let's try some and reload this I'm going to reload this open up here good work either I really just way too in love with my sound in fact somebody should probably I probably need an intervention about that all right so that was not the air here I'm gonna think about this a little bit do you know what's good to do read the documentation gets the tab that this script call is being made from maybe undefined if called from a non tab context for example a background page or that's the worst just just or pop up view so that's definitely the problem and that's probably why what I actually did in one of my examples is used query so let's let's use query so let's try using query so I'm gonna change this to saying I'm gonna go back to my content scrub where am I in the where am I looking in the pop up yeah in the pop up I'm gonna change this to chrome tabs query and what I need to do if I'm going to run query is I need to give it some parameters for the query like I need to I want it says optional but I want like all of the active tabs and I want I think it's only active or current window and current window I might not need these but I recall doing this in a previous example so but you it's up to you to read this documentation to see what tabs you want returned so I need that so now I can query for all of those tabs this is now I want to say got tabs because what I'm gonna do is get an array of tabs I know that the query function probably if I look at the documentation it explains gets all the tabs that have the specified properties there might be a way for me to just get only the current tab but I'm pretty sure that tabs index 0 is the tab that I want so let's try this now I think we're in good shape here I'm gonna go over here and I'm going to say reload the extension I'm gonna come over here press the popup Oh seriously how could that not have worked let's look at the tabs I'm gonna say got tabs and let's console.log it and now let's try this again to reload the extension I'm gonna not use my ridiculous sound effects anymore because I'm overdoing it I'm gonna reload the extension I'm gonna press this oh of course now it works I probably just like missed clicking save or reload or something anyway so I think it actually did work but that's how you would have debug it if it hadn't worked weirdly enough I like behind by one reload right because now I'm not seeing my messages save am I not like saving in the right it's like behind by one reload let's reload let's refresh I made the classic error I'm looking for all of my messages here only the content script messages will be there if I want to see the popup messages they are here so that is working it's an array it's this is the information I got lots of information as an incognito tab what URL is it on what's the width you can see there's lots of information that you can get all right we're in good shape let's move a little bit more quickly here just to finish this off so what I actually want to do is I want to send what I want to send is what was it called I called it user input user input value and what I want to do in the content script is rather than change the background color I'm going to change the inner HTML I think that's what I write to message dot text and I don't I'm not going to bother to check if it's a certain method there's only one kind of message I can so as long as I've gotten a message change whatever the paragraph text to that message okay here we go I'm feeling good about this I think this is gonna work and I'm going to reload the extension I'm going to refresh this page it's got some paragraphs on it I'm gonna feel confident enough to actually close the JavaScript console I'm going to open this up and now here we go all right I should have closed anything let's try this again let's look it let's look here Oh would I put this damn I go in there probably all of you noticed this and you've had to watch like an extra two minutes of this video it could edit out this mistake but probably gonna leave it in let's try this one more time reload extension and open Oh No and now press this now I'm going to type into the paragraph release this dot style is not relevant I had dot South and I was changing the background color inner HTML is not a part of the style it's just part of elements itself so I think it's gonna work this time I've corrected this everything's good here in terms of my syntax let's try this one more time okay here we go I am now going to reload the extension refresh the page press this button and start typing yeah look whatever I type into here now goes into every single paragraph element on the page this worked exclamation point thank you thank you very much so this has been the end of this sending a message from a popup to the Paige and I'm gonna do a coding challenge which you'll find at some point when I publish it where I'm going to actually take content from the page and display information while querying an API information about it there so I'm gonna do that in a coding challenge soon thanks for watching you
