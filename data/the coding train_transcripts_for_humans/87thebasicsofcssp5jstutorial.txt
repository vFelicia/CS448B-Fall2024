With timestamps:

00:01 - all right so this video is about a giant
00:04 - topic one I know very little about and
00:08 - that topic is CSS and so you know
00:11 - there's been a bunch of videos here that
00:12 - I made about the Dom the document object
00:15 - model web pages HTML pages javascript
00:18 - how they control HTML pages let's just
00:20 - take a step back for a moment and and
00:23 - look at the pieces we know about and
00:24 - what's this third piece that I'm adding
00:26 - so this web page this thing that you're
00:29 - seeing in the browser or in the sort of
00:31 - browser window of the p5.js editor where
00:33 - I'm writing all the code there the thing
00:37 - that this page loads is a file called
00:39 - index.html okay so and this is not a
00:43 - good pen I'm switching pens in this file
00:46 - there is some content written into that
00:48 - file for example there is a header
00:51 - that's at the top of the page there's a
00:54 - paragraph this file is also referring to
00:57 - some JavaScript code it's referring to a
01:01 - bunch of different things like the p5.js
01:03 - library file our own code which is in a
01:07 - file called sketch da Chasse and in
01:08 - those files were doing some JavaScript
01:11 - stuff like making a canvas drawing a
01:14 - circle to that canvas and perhaps even
01:17 - as we've seen in previous videos making
01:19 - other dumb elements like more paragraphs
01:21 - and affecting those and changing those
01:24 - elements so you can think of these
01:28 - pieces as HTML this is really the
01:32 - structure and you could also say like
01:35 - initial content in a way like what's on
01:38 - the page when it first loads of that
01:40 - webpage javascript is logic code things
01:44 - that can handle events store information
01:47 - make all sorts of magic happen this is
01:50 - what you can think of as the behavior of
01:52 - the page so this is where you or and I
01:55 - and everybody else who's doing this
01:57 - stuff is writing code to control what's
02:00 - happening on that page over time based
02:02 - on user interaction based on some
02:04 - mathematical algorithm based on whatever
02:06 - you might fancy you'd like to draw
02:08 - rainbows into canvas unicorns do that
02:11 - with jobs
02:12 - Natick unicorns to my repertoire here
02:14 - only that rainbows okay so a bit in the
02:17 - last piece here that I want to talk
02:19 - about is this idea of CSS and CSS stands
02:23 - for cascading style sheets I don't know
02:26 - why they're cascading probably has to do
02:28 - with some sort of like nesting and
02:29 - whatever somebody on the internet who
02:31 - really knows this stuff will hopefully
02:33 - write in the comments why it's cascading
02:35 - but the key word there is style so if
02:40 - you want to affect various aspects of
02:42 - the layout of this page you want the
02:45 - canvas to actually float on the right
02:46 - side of the page rather than the left
02:48 - side of the page you want to change the
02:49 - font that's in the paragraphs you want
02:51 - to change the background color of a
02:53 - paragraph you want to any just about
02:56 - anything that you can imagine that has
02:58 - to do with the visual look and feel of
03:00 - that page can be controlled with this
03:02 - idea of CSS now once again we're in the
03:06 - same place as we were with HTML you
03:09 - could write HTML into that index dot
03:13 - HTML file or you could dynamically from
03:17 - insert HTML elements into the page using
03:20 - Java Script
03:21 - you could write you can sort in give
03:24 - some initial content you can also
03:25 - control those elements using Java Script
03:28 - the same thing is true with CSS there is
03:30 - a kind of file that can work enough
03:33 - there is a kind another kind of file you
03:35 - could write I've disappeared from the
03:38 - world but I am still here you cannot see
03:41 - me but I am still here I will never
03:44 - leave it still everyone last person on
03:46 - earth actually most people on earth
03:48 - don't really need to know about CSS or
03:50 - maybe they should I don't really know I
03:51 - that was a terrible idea
03:53 - but you're here watching this video
03:57 - maybe CSS is useful to you I'm going to
03:59 - keep going umm the HTML file the
04:04 - JavaScript file now you can also add
04:07 - information about styles to another kind
04:10 - of file named maybe style name whatever
04:12 - you want dot CSS js4 JavaScript dot HTML
04:16 - for HTML dot CSS now we're in what I
04:20 - meant by saying we're in the same
04:22 - situation is I want to talk about how do
04:23 - you add that
04:24 - I'll stuff to style that CSS and that
04:27 - are and or how much you add style
04:30 - dynamically on the fly based on user
04:32 - interaction based on some sub behaviors
04:34 - in JavaScript this is the bigger picture
04:36 - here and then there's lots of details to
04:38 - fill in it boy am i rambling about this
04:40 - but hopefully it's making some sense
04:41 - okay so how does CSS work CSS works on
04:45 - assessing a couple different principles
04:47 - one is this idea of a selector so you
04:50 - need to have a selector meaning what are
04:55 - the things that you want to select to
04:57 - style do you want to select all the
04:59 - paragraphs on the page do you want to
05:01 - select just this one particular
05:02 - paragraph do you want to select the
05:04 - canvas do what what Dom elements do you
05:07 - want to select in order to style after
05:10 - you said after you specify that selector
05:12 - so for example let's say you want to
05:14 - style all the paragraph elements on the
05:16 - page your selector would be P then you
05:19 - need some open and close curly brackets
05:21 - much like you always do when you're
05:24 - doing these kinds of things to denote
05:26 - the beginning and end of the stuff that
05:28 - will the style information that will be
05:30 - applied to that paragraph once you have
05:32 - that all you need are a series of name
05:36 - value pairs looks kind of like a
05:40 - JavaScript object but the syntax is a
05:42 - little bit different these name value
05:44 - pairs are like what's the property you
05:46 - want to style and what's the value for
05:49 - that style for example I want to style
05:52 - the background color and I want the
05:55 - background color to be black or white
05:59 - that's white I want it to be like
06:01 - pinkish f0f so you could be asking your
06:05 - question like oh my god what oh well
06:09 - what is that that looks terrifying to me
06:10 - there's like a pound symbol and then a
06:12 - letter and then a number so there's a
06:14 - lot of things to learn this is a certain
06:16 - kind of special way of writing a color
06:18 - information you know I think maybe this
06:20 - would have been a little bit simpler if
06:22 - I just wrote the word pink here or
06:24 - purple here that would also work there a
06:27 - variety of different ways so now the
06:29 - question is what are the kinds of things
06:30 - that can go here you know font size is
06:32 - one of them I think so if I want to like
06:34 - change the font size there's so much
06:36 - that could go
06:37 - how do you know what the possibilities
06:38 - are how do you add that to your CSS and
06:42 - then how do you do that with JavaScript
06:44 - how much time do we have
06:46 - I'm gonna I'm gonna let's go to the code
06:48 - and look at how that some of this works
06:50 - okay I've disappeared but I'm gonna come
06:53 - back to life sunshine rain down upon me
06:56 - and give me some light
06:58 - and I shall appear now in front of the
07:00 - camera okay I have to turn this down
07:02 - okay so here I am with a p5.js project
07:06 - in the p5.js editor I'm going to run
07:10 - this and you can see there again or back
07:12 - here I have this h1 element this
07:16 - paragraph element this canvas another
07:18 - paragraph element a button some of these
07:20 - elements are written here into the HTML
07:24 - body right in advance these are HTML
07:27 - elements that appear on the page as soon
07:29 - as it loads some of these elements are
07:33 - created with JavaScript made dynamically
07:35 - when the program runs create a paragraph
07:37 - create a button okay this is where we
07:40 - are how do I start to style it style
07:42 - that paragraph okay so actually um what
07:46 - I'm going to do even though I said over
07:48 - here come back even though I said over
07:52 - here you can create a separate CSS file
07:55 - I'll do that in a later video what
07:57 - actually is button to the hi little
07:59 - hyperactive what actually I think I
08:01 - would like to do is show you how you can
08:03 - actually add CSS style information
08:06 - directly into the HTML page so inside of
08:09 - this head tag where I'm referring to
08:12 - JavaScript files I could also
08:15 - potentially refer to some style
08:19 - information so what's that syntax
08:22 - paragraph I want to select all of the
08:25 - paragraphs on the page and assign them a
08:28 - background color which is purple I wish
08:32 - I could type a rainbow there do you
08:33 - think it works if I type rainbow there I
08:35 - doubt it
08:35 - okay so now if I save and I run this
08:39 - again we can see look this paragraph
08:41 - element has a purple background this
08:44 - paragraph element has a purple
08:45 - background you know it's very hard for
08:47 - me to see the text so I think if I say
08:49 - this
08:50 - color it refers to the color of the text
08:53 - inside the paragraph I think and now you
08:57 - can see I have white text with a purple
09:00 - background it looks a little crowded in
09:02 - there so something that I might add to
09:04 - this is some padding and how much
09:06 - padding how about eight pixels px for
09:10 - pixel so I'm going to do this look I
09:13 - look at this I've got some nice padding
09:15 - now so this is the basic idea of CSS I
09:18 - need to select something on the page and
09:21 - then give it some properties what's the
09:23 - property what's the value what's the
09:25 - property what's the value how do you
09:26 - know what all these possible properties
09:28 - are well you need to look this stuff up
09:30 - you can get books you watch other videos
09:32 - that where someone really knows about
09:33 - CSS is talking about this but um but and
09:37 - this is worried so let's look for this
09:39 - briefly in a moment and I have a couple
09:41 - more minutes left I am going to uh so I
09:47 - am on here developer dot Mozilla uh um
09:51 - so this is one place I'll put some links
09:53 - in the description for this video but
09:55 - here is a URL of where I could find some
09:57 - information about CSS I'm going to
09:59 - remove this part here this is a CSS
10:04 - reference there's a tutorial there's
10:06 - demos I want to look at the ref and
10:08 - exhaustive I've exhausted already an
10:11 - exhaustive reference I'm gonna look at
10:13 - the exhaustive reference and I'm going
10:15 - to see like look these are all of the
10:17 - possible things I could add there's so
10:19 - much I just keep scrolling and scrolling
10:20 - and scrolling and scrolling but we can
10:22 - look under I can look for like
10:24 - background color and you can see
10:26 - background color is right over here I
10:29 - can click on it and what do I see now I
10:32 - see here are some examples of different
10:36 - ways that I can call background color
10:37 - could say red I could say RGB I could
10:39 - say current all sorts of ways so this is
10:42 - a topic for another time or another
10:44 - video for you to look on your own
10:46 - there's another CSS reference that I
10:48 - like to use if I could find it in my
10:50 - history here I think it's this one right
10:54 - so I'll include a link to this this is a
10:56 - nice reference of all sorts of possible
10:58 - parameters in CSS the things that I want
11:02 - to focus on in
11:03 - in my videos is less about the full
11:06 - encompassing of all of the CSS reference
11:08 - and more about two things one is this
11:13 - how do these selectors work what are
11:15 - other ways that I could specifically
11:17 - address a single paragraph are only some
11:19 - paragraph there's a lot of ways you can
11:21 - use these selector so I want to get to
11:22 - that and the other thing I want to get
11:24 - to is how do you do style dynamically in
11:28 - JavaScript so with p5.js specifically so
11:32 - let's take at least another video I'm
11:35 - one of my future videos I'm going to
11:36 - talk more about selectors but in this
11:38 - particular video I want to look at the
11:40 - style function so here if I come back if
11:45 - I quit Chrome for a second and I come
11:47 - back to this we can see that these
11:50 - particular elements
11:52 - now these paragraph elements are all
11:54 - styled based on the hard-coded style
11:57 - information that's in the HTML file
11:59 - inside of the style tags but another
12:02 - thing I can do is right over here I can
12:07 - for any HTM any element that I create
12:10 - with p5 and later and show you any
12:12 - element that I access in p5 whether it
12:14 - was created or not I can call a function
12:17 - called style which then requires just
12:22 - two arguments what are those arguments
12:25 - the name of the style property the value
12:29 - of the style property so if I were to
12:30 - put right here in quotes background -
12:34 - color and then I were to say in here in
12:38 - quotes pink you can see look at this
12:42 - this particular element is still getting
12:46 - the style from the HTML page this
12:48 - particular element woop I'm not there
12:52 - this particular element down here is
12:55 - getting the style from my code so when I
12:58 - apply a piece of styling dynamically in
13:01 - code it's going to overwrite the style
13:04 - that was originally set up in the HTML
13:06 - page so there's a lot of pieces here and
13:08 - for you essentially you're following
13:10 - these videos along what I would suggest
13:12 - you do is try adding some style to the
13:14 - HTML file in the same way
13:17 - a that I did here try adding some styles
13:21 - this way
13:22 - what other tags might you reference try
13:25 - adding some styles this way what happens
13:27 - if you add styles to other kinds of
13:29 - elements that aren't just paragraph
13:31 - elements and lastly and I'll do this for
13:33 - you really quickly set something style
13:36 - with an event okay let's think about
13:38 - this for example what if I say what if I
13:42 - were to say button dot mousepressed
13:47 - change style right so now I am attaching
13:53 - the change style event to the press of
13:56 - this button and what is that change
13:58 - style event it's a function that I need
14:01 - to write write the code inside this
14:03 - function right here will execute when I
14:06 - click the mouse on that button and maybe
14:08 - I'll change the text style to pink and
14:11 - maybe I'll give it a lot more padding
14:16 - because who doesn't love padding jazz
14:20 - hands I don't know I feel like that's
14:22 - going to be the desk JavaScript that
14:23 - musical that's my first song who doesn't
14:25 - love padding you're with me on that okay
14:29 - so now if we look at this everything's
14:33 - got its default style I'm going to
14:34 - trigger that event I got some more
14:36 - padding and a pink background so and you
14:39 - know maybe what I want to do I just got
14:41 - to do a little bit more say text mouse
14:43 - over change style oops and then I'll say
14:49 - button I'll say text Mouse out revert
14:54 - style and what I can do here and I'm
14:59 - going to I'm just showing you some other
15:01 - things a revert style and background
15:07 - purple padding eight pixels so let's
15:12 - take out the button event for a second
15:13 - I'm using Mouse out and mouse over a
15:16 - mouse over I'm Mouse out I mouse over
15:18 - I'm Mouse out I mouse over that's a very
15:20 - rhythmic so you can see here that you
15:23 - can start to highlight things make
15:25 - things happen based on button presses
15:26 - based on mouse over
15:27 - out based on the movement of a slider as
15:30 - we saw in the previous video so many
15:32 - possibilities so now you have something
15:34 - to work with try adding some style to
15:37 - the HTML page try adding some style
15:39 - using the style function see what types
15:41 - of elements what types of designs you
15:43 - can make and I'm going to come back and
15:44 - look at this again and again and again
15:46 - in several videos looking at other
15:48 - different types of scenarios with more
15:50 - events and more ways of selecting
15:51 - elements which classes and ID's is the
15:54 - topic for that and just as a reminder go
15:57 - and look in those references that will
15:58 - be linked below as to where you can find
16:00 - all this stuff so I'm five minutes over
16:02 - time not that that is relevant to you
16:04 - especially if you're watching this
16:05 - sometime in the future like in the year
16:07 - 2000 that was a while ago I guess but in
16:10 - my my childhood the year 2000 seemed
16:13 - very far away the year 3000 is a be
16:16 - watching this because you're watching
16:17 - this is a year 3000 please go get my
16:18 - brain out of that cryogenic thing that
16:21 - it's in and I don't know yeah do
16:26 - something with it talk to me about
16:27 - rainbows okay goodbye and I'll see you
16:30 - in a future video

Cleaned transcript:

all right so this video is about a giant topic one I know very little about and that topic is CSS and so you know there's been a bunch of videos here that I made about the Dom the document object model web pages HTML pages javascript how they control HTML pages let's just take a step back for a moment and and look at the pieces we know about and what's this third piece that I'm adding so this web page this thing that you're seeing in the browser or in the sort of browser window of the p5.js editor where I'm writing all the code there the thing that this page loads is a file called index.html okay so and this is not a good pen I'm switching pens in this file there is some content written into that file for example there is a header that's at the top of the page there's a paragraph this file is also referring to some JavaScript code it's referring to a bunch of different things like the p5.js library file our own code which is in a file called sketch da Chasse and in those files were doing some JavaScript stuff like making a canvas drawing a circle to that canvas and perhaps even as we've seen in previous videos making other dumb elements like more paragraphs and affecting those and changing those elements so you can think of these pieces as HTML this is really the structure and you could also say like initial content in a way like what's on the page when it first loads of that webpage javascript is logic code things that can handle events store information make all sorts of magic happen this is what you can think of as the behavior of the page so this is where you or and I and everybody else who's doing this stuff is writing code to control what's happening on that page over time based on user interaction based on some mathematical algorithm based on whatever you might fancy you'd like to draw rainbows into canvas unicorns do that with jobs Natick unicorns to my repertoire here only that rainbows okay so a bit in the last piece here that I want to talk about is this idea of CSS and CSS stands for cascading style sheets I don't know why they're cascading probably has to do with some sort of like nesting and whatever somebody on the internet who really knows this stuff will hopefully write in the comments why it's cascading but the key word there is style so if you want to affect various aspects of the layout of this page you want the canvas to actually float on the right side of the page rather than the left side of the page you want to change the font that's in the paragraphs you want to change the background color of a paragraph you want to any just about anything that you can imagine that has to do with the visual look and feel of that page can be controlled with this idea of CSS now once again we're in the same place as we were with HTML you could write HTML into that index dot HTML file or you could dynamically from insert HTML elements into the page using Java Script you could write you can sort in give some initial content you can also control those elements using Java Script the same thing is true with CSS there is a kind of file that can work enough there is a kind another kind of file you could write I've disappeared from the world but I am still here you cannot see me but I am still here I will never leave it still everyone last person on earth actually most people on earth don't really need to know about CSS or maybe they should I don't really know I that was a terrible idea but you're here watching this video maybe CSS is useful to you I'm going to keep going umm the HTML file the JavaScript file now you can also add information about styles to another kind of file named maybe style name whatever you want dot CSS js4 JavaScript dot HTML for HTML dot CSS now we're in what I meant by saying we're in the same situation is I want to talk about how do you add that I'll stuff to style that CSS and that are and or how much you add style dynamically on the fly based on user interaction based on some sub behaviors in JavaScript this is the bigger picture here and then there's lots of details to fill in it boy am i rambling about this but hopefully it's making some sense okay so how does

and look at how that some of this works okay I've disappeared but I'm gonna come back to life sunshine rain down upon me and give me some light and I shall appear now in front of the camera okay I have to turn this down okay so here I am with a p5.js project in the p5.js editor I'm going to run this and you can see there again or back here I have this h1 element this paragraph element this canvas another paragraph element a button some of these elements are written here into the HTML body right in advance these are HTML elements that appear on the page as soon as it loads some of these elements are created with JavaScript made dynamically when the program runs create a paragraph create a button okay this is where we are how do I start to style it style that paragraph okay so actually um what I'm going to do even though I said over here come back even though I said over here you can create a separate CSS file I'll do that in a later video what actually is button to the hi little hyperactive what actually I think I would like to do is show you how you can actually add CSS style information directly into the HTML page so inside of this head tag where I'm referring to JavaScript files I could also potentially refer to some style information so what's that syntax paragraph I want to select all of the paragraphs on the page and assign them a background color which is purple I wish I could type a rainbow there do you think it works if I type rainbow there I doubt it okay so now if I save and I run this again we can see look this paragraph element has a purple background this paragraph element has a purple background you know it's very hard for me to see the text so I think if I say this color it refers to the color of the text inside the paragraph I think and now you can see I have white text with a purple background it looks a little crowded in there so something that I might add to this is some padding and how much padding how about eight pixels px for pixel so I'm going to do this look I look at this I've got some nice padding now so this is the basic idea of CSS I need to select something on the page and then give it some properties what's the property what's the value what's the property what's the value how do you know what all these possible properties are well you need to look this stuff up you can get books you watch other videos that where someone really knows about CSS is talking about this but um but and this is worried so let's look for this briefly in a moment and I have a couple more minutes left I am going to uh so I am on here developer dot Mozilla uh um so this is one place I'll put some links in the description for this video but here is a URL of where I could find some information about CSS I'm going to remove this part here this is a CSS reference there's a tutorial there's demos I want to look at the ref and exhaustive I've exhausted already an exhaustive reference I'm gonna look at the exhaustive reference and I'm going to see like look these are all of the possible things I could add there's so much I just keep scrolling and scrolling and scrolling and scrolling but we can look under I can look for like background color and you can see background color is right over here I can click on it and what do I see now I see here are some examples of different ways that I can call background color could say red I could say RGB I could say current all sorts of ways so this is a topic for another time or another video for you to look on your own there's another CSS reference that I like to use if I could find it in my history here I think it's this one right so I'll include a link to this this is a nice reference of all sorts of possible parameters in CSS the things that I want to focus on in in my videos is less about the full encompassing of all of the CSS reference and more about two things one is this how do these selectors work what are other ways that I could specifically address a single paragraph are only some paragraph there's a lot of ways you can use these selector so I want to get to that and the other thing I want to get to is how do you do style dynamically in JavaScript so with p5.js specifically so let's take at least another video I'm one of my future videos I'm going to talk more about selectors but in this particular video I want to look at the style function so here if I come back if I quit Chrome for a second and I come back to this we can see that these particular elements now these paragraph elements are all styled based on the hardcoded style information that's in the HTML file inside of the style tags but another thing I can do is right over here I can for any HTM any element that I create with p5 and later and show you any element that I access in p5 whether it was created or not I can call a function called style which then requires just two arguments what are those arguments the name of the style property the value of the style property so if I were to put right here in quotes background color and then I were to say in here in quotes pink you can see look at this this particular element is still getting the style from the HTML page this particular element woop I'm not there this particular element down here is getting the style from my code so when I apply a piece of styling dynamically in code it's going to overwrite the style that was originally set up in the HTML page so there's a lot of pieces here and for you essentially you're following these videos along what I would suggest you do is try adding some style to the HTML file in the same way a that I did here try adding some styles this way what other tags might you reference try adding some styles this way what happens if you add styles to other kinds of elements that aren't just paragraph elements and lastly and I'll do this for you really quickly set something style with an event okay let's think about this for example what if I say what if I were to say button dot mousepressed change style right so now I am attaching the change style event to the press of this button and what is that change style event it's a function that I need to write write the code inside this function right here will execute when I click the mouse on that button and maybe I'll change the text style to pink and maybe I'll give it a lot more padding because who doesn't love padding jazz hands I don't know I feel like that's going to be the desk JavaScript that musical that's my first song who doesn't love padding you're with me on that okay so now if we look at this everything's got its default style I'm going to trigger that event I got some more padding and a pink background so and you know maybe what I want to do I just got to do a little bit more say text mouse over change style oops and then I'll say button I'll say text Mouse out revert style and what I can do here and I'm going to I'm just showing you some other things a revert style and background purple padding eight pixels so let's take out the button event for a second I'm using Mouse out and mouse over a mouse over I'm Mouse out I mouse over I'm Mouse out I mouse over that's a very rhythmic so you can see here that you can start to highlight things make things happen based on button presses based on mouse over out based on the movement of a slider as we saw in the previous video so many possibilities so now you have something to work with try adding some style to the HTML page try adding some style using the style function see what types of elements what types of designs you can make and I'm going to come back and look at this again and again and again in several videos looking at other different types of scenarios with more events and more ways of selecting elements which classes and ID's is the topic for that and just as a reminder go and look in those references that will be linked below as to where you can find all this stuff so I'm five minutes over time not that that is relevant to you especially if you're watching this sometime in the future like in the year 2000 that was a while ago I guess but in my my childhood the year 2000 seemed very far away the year 3000 is a be watching this because you're watching this is a year 3000 please go get my brain out of that cryogenic thing that it's in and I don't know yeah do something with it talk to me about rainbows okay goodbye and I'll see you in a future video
