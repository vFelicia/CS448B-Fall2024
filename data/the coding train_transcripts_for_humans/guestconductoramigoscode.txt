00:00 - [TRAIN WHISTLE]
00:00 - Hi, everyone.
00:01 - Welcome to The Coding Train.
00:03 - I'm Dan.
00:03 - I'm still quarantined here at
home in Brooklyn, New York.
00:06 - And today, I am bringing
you a guest video.
00:09 - So I've had guests
on The Coding Train
00:11 - before-- tutorials,
presentations,
00:14 - some live streams even.
00:16 - I'm dedicating
myself this summer.
00:17 - I'm really trying to make
a commitment to having
00:19 - more guests on the channel.
00:21 - I'm calling this
Guest Conductors now.
00:23 - And what I want to
do with this series
00:25 - is highlight others in the
community that are doing work
00:28 - to expand the fields of
art, technology, education,
00:31 - and activism.
00:31 - So I'm going to bring you
guest videos and tutorials
00:33 - and live streams.
00:35 - So one of the things that
I think is important to say
00:39 - is that there are barriers
of access to technology,
00:42 - and there is anti-Blackness
within the tech community.
00:44 - And so I want to say
Black Lives Matter.
00:46 - And one of the things that I
want to do with this series
00:49 - is use this platform as a
way to amplify Black voices
00:53 - and perspectives.
00:54 - So I want to extend this
platform to people beyond me,
00:58 - and I want to offer
opportunities for others
01:00 - to share their stories
openly, honestly.
01:02 - You could talk about really
anything you want to.
01:05 - This platform is available.
01:07 - But one of things
you might want to do
01:09 - is just teach about
something you'd love
01:10 - to make or explore with code.
01:12 - So if you want to get involved
with the Guest Conductor
01:14 - series on The
Coding Train, there
01:16 - will be a lot more information.
01:18 - I'm not so eloquent in my
rambling explanation of this.
01:22 - But hopefully, in the
video's description,
01:23 - if you go down and read, there
will be a lot more information
01:25 - about what I'm doing
with the channel
01:27 - and how to get involved.
01:28 - So first of all,
this isn't actually
01:30 - the first in this
Guest Conductor series.
01:33 - If you missed Aren Davey,
guest appearance just
01:36 - a couple of weeks, Aren
runs a Twitch channel.
01:38 - She's a Processing
Foundation fellow,
01:41 - and she runs a Twitch
channel called Cozy Coding.
01:43 - It's the coziest
place on the internet,
01:45 - with p5.js jam sessions.
01:47 - And really, it's great if
you're a beginner coder,
01:49 - if you're experienced.
01:51 - She's just doing awesome
work there on Twitch,
01:53 - so check that out.
01:55 - But today, I am very
excited to bring you
01:58 - Nelson from Amigoscode.
02:00 - So Nelson from Amigoscode
is a software engineer.
02:03 - Like a real life
software engineer.
02:05 - Not like one who just plays
one on YouTube, like me.
02:08 - And he makes a lot of videos
about coding real projects
02:12 - and learning the skills that
companies are looking for.
02:15 - And he's got all these courses.
02:17 - Thousands of students
have taken his courses.
02:19 - He's got a Facebook
group, a Discord group.
02:21 - There's over 5,000 people
there talking about code.
02:24 - So I really encourage
you to check--
02:25 - those links will be in
this video's subscription
02:27 - to go take a look and join
the Amigoscode community.
02:31 - But one of the things I'm really
excited about this video, which
02:34 - is called How to Switch
Jobs and Become a Software
02:36 - Engineer-- it's a
reupload of a video that
02:37 - already exists on his channel.
02:38 - So first of all, just go over
there and watch the video.
02:41 - I'll put a card up
for you to click.
02:42 - But what this video addresses
is career development.
02:45 - What does it mean to work
as a software engineer?
02:47 - It's not something
that I really spend
02:49 - a lot of time talking about.
02:50 - It's not something that
I claim to have really
02:52 - any expert knowledge in at all.
02:53 - So I think this is a nice
complement to some of the work
02:55 - that I'm doing.
02:57 - And regardless of whether
you stay here and watch it--
02:59 - I'm going to play it
for you right now--
03:01 - or you head over there and
watch it, whatever you do,
03:03 - Nelson will tell you--
03:04 - I'm going to be
quoting from Nelson--
03:06 - smash.
03:08 - I can't believe
I'm saying smash.
03:09 - Don't smash my Like
and Subscribe button.
03:11 - It's very delicate.
03:12 - But Amigoscode, smash
the Subscribe and Like.
03:17 - Enjoy this wonderful
discussion from Amigoscode.
03:21 - Subscribe to Amigoscode.
03:22 - Check out Nelson's work there.
03:24 - And I look forward to seeing
you in more Guest Conductor
03:27 - videos on The Coding Train.
03:29 - See you soon.
03:30 - [TRAIN WHISTLE]
03:31 - [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
What's going on, guys?
03:35 - Welcome to Amigoscode.
03:36 - If you're new to my channel, go
ahead and smash the Subscribe
03:40 - button because that's
the way I can grow
03:45 - and I keep on providing
more content like this.
03:47 - And also, smash the Like button.
03:49 - It makes me really happy in
knowing that you guys are
03:55 - actually enjoying
this, so I can carry
03:57 - on providing content for you
that will help you to become
04:01 - a much better developer.
04:03 - So this is what
Amigoscode is about.
04:06 - So also if you are--
04:07 - [BEEP]
04:08 - If you're not-- [BEEP].
04:09 - And also, if you are not--
04:10 - [BEEP]
04:11 - And also, if you are not
part of the Facebook group,
04:15 - go ahead and join
because right now we
04:16 - are over 4,000 people,
which is insane.
04:21 - I remember when I
started it was just me.
04:23 - But over-- I think it was
over the last year or so,
04:27 - especially the last month
or so actually, there's
04:31 - been like a lot
of people joining,
04:33 - a lot of people contributing.
04:34 - And now we have
this thing called--
04:36 - this thing where
we do mentorships.
04:39 - So we have a couple of us
where we mentor people,
04:43 - guiding them on the right path
in terms of becoming a better
04:47 - software engineer and securing
a job and all of these things.
04:51 - So go ahead and join the
private Facebook group.
04:55 - So in this video,
what I want to talk to
04:57 - you about is the easiest way
for you to switch careers.
05:05 - The easiest way
for you to switch
05:07 - careers to become a software
engineer if you have a job.
05:13 - So this only applies for
you if you have a job.
05:16 - So if you don't
have a job, I'm also
05:18 - planning on doing
a video on that.
05:20 - But if you have a job,
what is the easiest
05:24 - way for you to switch careers
and become a software engineer?
05:30 - So let me just tell you
that-- and I know people that
05:32 - have done it in many companies.
05:34 - And I don't know whether
it is something that it's
05:38 - been mentioned out there.
05:40 - But this is one of
the easiest ways.
05:42 - So if you work for a company--
05:45 - if you work for a company
and they are a tech company--
05:51 - and even if they're
not tech but if they
05:53 - use some kind of technology,
if some part of the business
05:59 - you have software
engineers in-house.
06:03 - So let's say you
work in a department
06:05 - and you know that the company
has software engineers
06:09 - within your company.
06:10 - It doesn't have to be
in the same location.
06:13 - It could be in a
different location.
06:14 - But if there are
software engineers,
06:17 - then you are in a good place.
06:19 - Now let me tell you how.
06:21 - So let's say that you work
for a company and they--
06:27 - let's say you work
for Schrap or Twilio.
06:30 - Let's say Twilio.
06:31 - Or really, it's any company--
06:34 - any company that they
write software or they
06:37 - have some people
writing software.
06:39 - So if you want to switch to
become a software engineer,
06:44 - this is what you should do.
06:45 - So I don't advise
you to quit your job
06:49 - and then attend a bootcamp,
and then apply for jobs.
06:52 - Don't do that yet.
06:54 - So bootcamps should be the last
resource that you should try.
06:58 - So what you can
do is if you know
07:01 - another company
uses, for example,
07:03 - a particular language--
let's say, Python.
07:06 - So they use Python, and let's
say they use Go lang as well,
07:10 - or JavaScript.
07:11 - Let's say they use
these three languages.
07:14 - So what you do--
07:15 - what you do-- so this is
even before you switching
07:18 - and approaching people.
07:19 - What you do is you try
and actually use and try.
07:25 - You go and learn
these languages.
07:28 - So Python, Go, and JavaScript.
07:31 - Go and learn these
three languages.
07:33 - So the platform that you
should be using is YouTube.
07:38 - So you've got many people
teaching these languages,
07:42 - and they're really good
and awesome content.
07:46 - And I'm going to leave a link
on some of the people that I
07:48 - recommend, such as Free
Code Camp, Traversy Media,
07:52 - and he's got lots of
videos on JavaScript.
07:56 - There are many, many
people out there,
08:00 - and the content is amazing.
08:03 - So there you don't
spend any money.
08:05 - So you are learning for free.
08:08 - So that's the goal, really.
08:10 - You don't want to
spend any money.
08:11 - So you learn for free, and then
you kind of join, for example,
08:15 - my Facebook group
or any other group
08:19 - or any community that
talks about coding.
08:24 - And that way, if you have any
questions, you can post them,
08:28 - and then people will
get back to you.
08:30 - And for example, in my group,
we actually talk to people.
08:35 - We have video calls
and so on and so forth.
08:38 - So go and join a community.
08:43 - So if you have any questions,
you go and ask them.
08:46 - So now you've
learned the languages
08:49 - that the company
uses, what you need
08:51 - to do next is to try and
build an application very
08:58 - similar to what they do.
09:01 - It doesn't have to be
the entire application.
09:03 - It could even be
a small feature.
09:05 - So let's say that you
really like what they do.
09:09 - You want to-- for example,
you wanted to have,
09:11 - for example, a feature
that they don't have.
09:14 - So for example, they
might have an API
09:17 - and you can actually
connect to their API
09:20 - and then build a small feature
that the company doesn't have
09:25 - but you think that
it would be very
09:27 - beneficial for the company.
09:29 - You would do that.
09:31 - And then that way--
09:34 - now you've gone off and
learned the languages.
09:37 - So you showed some interest.
09:39 - But on top of that, you've
built a project and a feature
09:45 - that they even
might be interested.
09:49 - So once you do those two
things, the next step for you
09:52 - is to try and see how you're
going to approach someone
09:58 - within the company that can
lead you to the right person.
10:04 - You might talk to HR.
10:06 - Or let's say, you go for lunch
with a software engineer,
10:10 - you might talk to him
and tell him, look,
10:12 - I've been thinking about this.
10:13 - I've been learning
this technology.
10:15 - I've even implemented this.
10:17 - Who is the best person to talk?
10:19 - And then they might direct
you to the actual person
10:23 - in charge of recruitment
or even the director
10:27 - or the technical lead.
10:30 - It doesn't matter.
10:31 - It doesn't matter.
10:31 - So once you reach
the right person,
10:37 - this is when you impress.
10:40 - This is when you impress.
10:41 - So you can talk about what
you've done, what you've built,
10:46 - and I can guarantee you--
like, I can guarantee you--
10:50 - you will blow their minds.
10:54 - So you can tell them this story.
10:56 - You can say, look, I've
been thinking about becoming
10:59 - a software engineer.
11:00 - I enjoy my work but
I think I want to be
11:05 - challenged in a different area.
11:09 - I've always liked working with
computers and solving problems.
11:13 - So I went away and I built this
application that uses the API.
11:17 - I was studying the
application, how it works,
11:19 - and I saw that you
were missing a feature.
11:23 - And then I tried
to implement it.
11:27 - And basically, there,
you're just showing interest
11:29 - because now the
company, they don't have
11:32 - to go outside to hire people.
11:35 - Because, first, they
already know that you
11:38 - work within the company.
11:39 - So if they want
to get reference,
11:40 - they can talk to your manager
or someone that give--
11:45 - or someone that can give you--
11:47 - or actually, someone that can
give them feedback about you.
11:50 - So they don't have
to go outside.
11:52 - Everything is internally, right?
11:54 - And if they see
that you are capable
11:57 - and you are willing to learn
and you can fit their culture,
12:04 - I can guarantee that
you will switch careers.
12:08 - So this is what I
recommend for people
12:13 - that want to become
software engineers
12:17 - and they work within a company.
12:20 - So as I said, the location--
12:23 - so for example,
many companies have,
12:25 - for example, one
department in one location
12:27 - and the other department
in a different location.
12:31 - So this is actually
totally fine.
12:33 - You just need to
know how to approach
12:34 - the right people to talk to and
see how you are going to make
12:41 - that transition, that switch.
12:44 - Yeah.
12:45 - So I've been talking to people,
for example, in recruitment.
12:47 - They are switching to
software engineering roles.
12:51 - The bootcamp
industry is actually
12:53 - booming because
software engineering,
12:56 - there's lots of flexibilities.
12:58 - They have lots of opportunities
and a lot of things
13:00 - that you can build.
13:01 - It's amazing.
13:03 - It's amazing.
13:04 - So yeah.
13:05 - So this is my advice.
13:09 - And I feel like if, for example,
you don't have a job right now
13:15 - and you are switching, then
I think your approach would
13:18 - be somewhat different.
13:19 - And I've got really good
advice for you to apply.
13:27 - And also, one more thing
that I actually almost forgot
13:29 - is make sure that
you learn about Git.
13:32 - So Git allows you to
basically store your code
13:39 - in a repository, and then
you can share that repository
13:43 - with people because if you
are talking that you have been
13:48 - building this stuff,
then you can say, look,
13:50 - I've built this stuff, and
this is my GitHub repository.
13:53 - And then what they
do is just go and see
13:55 - whether you're not lying or not.
13:57 - So there, they
can see your code,
14:00 - and they can see, wow,
he's got potential.
14:02 - He's got potential.
14:04 - So this is what I wanted
to talk to you about,
14:07 - because I feel like--
14:10 - I'm not sure if I've seen
videos like this or anyone
14:13 - talking about this matter.
14:15 - And let me know.
14:16 - Let me know what you think,
whether you've switched careers
14:18 - like this and maybe
there is something
14:20 - that you want me to spread
with the wider community.
14:24 - Let me know.
14:26 - And this is all for now.
14:27 - So if you have any
questions, as I said--
14:31 - I always say, if
you have questions
14:35 - or if you need advice, go
ahead and join the group.
14:39 - Make sure to subscribe.
14:40 - Like, literally
subscribe and give me
14:43 - a thumbs up so I can keep on
recording videos like this.
14:47 - So this is all for now.
14:50 - I'll catch you in the
next one, [NON-ENGLISH]..

[TRAIN WHISTLE] Hi, everyone. Welcome to The Coding Train. I'm Dan. I'm still quarantined here at home in Brooklyn, New York. And today, I am bringing you a guest video.

The easiest way for you to switch careers to become a software engineer if you have a job. So this only applies for you if you have a job. So if you don't have a job, I'm also planning on doing a video on that. But if you have a job, what is the easiest way for you to switch careers and become a software engineer? So let me just tell you that and I know people that have done it in many companies. And I don't know whether it is something that it's been mentioned out there. But this is one of the easiest ways.

So Python, Go, and JavaScript. Go and learn these three languages. So the platform that you should be using is YouTube. So you've got many people teaching these languages, and they're really good and awesome content. And I'm going to leave a link on some of the people that I recommend, such as Free Code Camp, Traversy Media, and he's got lots of videos on JavaScript. There are many, many people out there, and the content is amazing. So there you don't spend any money. So you are learning for free. So that's the goal, really. You don't want to spend any money. So you learn for free, and then you kind of join, for example, my Facebook group or any other group or any community that talks about coding. And that way, if you have any questions, you can post them, and then people will get back to you. And for example, in my group, we actually talk to people. We have video calls and so on and so forth. So go and join a community. So if you have any questions, you go and ask them. So now you've learned the languages that the company uses, what you need to do next is to try and build an application very similar to what they do. It doesn't have to be the entire application. It could even be a small feature. So let's say that you really like what they do. You want to for example, you wanted to have, for example, a feature that they don't have. So for example, they might have an API and you can actually connect to their API and then build a small feature that the company doesn't have but you think that it would be very beneficial for the company. You would do that. And then that way now you've gone off and learned the languages. So you showed some interest. But on top of that, you've built a project and a feature that they even might be interested. So once you do those two things, the next step for you is to try and see how you're going to approach someone within the company that can lead you to the right person. You might talk to HR. Or let's say, you go for lunch with a software engineer, you might talk to him and tell him, look, I've been thinking about this. I've been learning this technology. I've even implemented this. Who is the best person to talk? And then they might direct you to the actual person in charge of recruitment or even the director or the technical lead. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. So once you reach the right person, this is when you impress. This is when you impress. So you can talk about what you've done, what you've built, and I can guarantee you like, I can guarantee you you will blow their minds. So you can tell them this story. You can say, look, I've been thinking about becoming a software engineer. I enjoy my work but I think I want to be challenged in a different area. I've always liked working with computers and solving problems. So I went away and I built this application that uses the API. I was studying the application, how it works, and I saw that you were missing a feature. And then I tried to implement it. And basically, there, you're just showing interest because now the company, they don't have to go outside to hire people. Because, first, they already know that you work within the company. So if they want to get reference, they can talk to your manager or someone that give or someone that can give you or actually, someone that can give them feedback about you. So they don't have to go outside. Everything is internally, right? And if they see that you are capable and you are willing to learn and you can fit their culture, I can guarantee that you will switch careers. So this is what I recommend for people that want to become software engineers and they work within a company. So as I said, the location so for example, many companies have, for example, one department in one location and the other department in a different location. So this is actually totally fine. You just need to know how to approach the right people to talk to and see how you are going to make that transition, that switch. Yeah. So I've been talking to people, for example, in recruitment. They are switching to software engineering roles. The bootcamp industry is actually booming because software engineering, there's lots of flexibilities. They have lots of opportunities and a lot of things that you can build. It's amazing. It's amazing. So yeah. So this is my advice. And I feel like if, for example, you don't have a job right now and you are switching, then I think your approach would be somewhat different. And I've got really good advice for you to apply. And also, one more thing that I actually almost forgot is make sure that you learn about Git. So Git allows you to basically store your code in a repository, and then you can share that repository with people because if you are talking that you have been building this stuff, then you can say, look, I've built this stuff, and this is my GitHub repository. And then what they do is just go and see whether you're not lying or not. So there, they can see your code, and they can see, wow, he's got potential. He's got potential. So this is what I wanted to talk to you about, because I feel like I'm not sure if I've seen videos like this or anyone talking about this matter. And let me know. Let me know what you think, whether you've switched careers like this and maybe there is something that you want me to spread with the wider community. Let me know. And this is all for now. So if you have any questions, as I said I always say, if you have questions or if you need advice, go ahead and join the group. Make sure to subscribe. Like, literally subscribe and give me a thumbs up so I can keep on recording videos like this. So this is all for now. I'll catch you in the next one, [NONENGLISH]..
