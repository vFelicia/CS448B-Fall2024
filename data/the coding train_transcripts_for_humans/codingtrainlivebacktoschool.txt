04:14 - switch the camera
04:16 - to me in about one minute
04:19 - um

05:06 - switching to me
05:08 - hi well i might be brighter good morning
05:12 - oh is it the morning it's 10 37 a.m
05:15 - welcome this is the coding train
05:18 - with me your host daniel
05:21 - schiffman
05:25 - with the train whistle
05:28 - it doesn't work very well let's check to
05:30 - see if my whiteboard camera is working
05:33 - almost no chance of this yeah that's not
05:36 - that's not a positive sign i guess i
05:38 - will not be demonstrating that today uh
05:41 - welcome um i'm i'm having a bit of a
05:43 - slow start um
05:45 - as some of you might be aware um i am in
05:48 - a new studio i'm in a garage it's quite
05:51 - a large space i wonder how the echo is
05:54 - right now i've got some i've i've been
05:56 - buying a lot of new stuff i've got a new
05:58 - light
06:00 - which i would love to show you but look
06:02 - the camera that i'm gonna do some behind
06:04 - the scenes stuff at some point i've got
06:06 - a new light i've got another new light
06:07 - that i didn't set up yet i've got some
06:09 - sound blankets to help with the echo
06:11 - i've got sound foam that i need to put
06:14 - maybe on the ceiling that will also help
06:17 - um
06:18 - and uh hello to italy uh says alex uh in
06:22 - the chat
06:23 - uh
06:24 - bon giorno did i get that anywhere close
06:27 - the correct ciao okay maybe that's a
06:29 - little bit ah i think there's a dead
06:31 - cicada on the ground over here i'm kind
06:33 - of in a semi-outdoor space which is sort
06:36 - of fun gloria pickle my lovely pup is
06:39 - over there sitting in the grass i can
06:40 - see her out of the corner of my eye
06:45 - i think this might be a total disaster
06:46 - of a stream but uh
06:48 - it is still sponsored so oh let me go
06:51 - over here and say uh thank you before i
06:53 - forget to the sponsor of today's coding
06:56 - train stream uh brilliant brilliant is
06:59 - like the place on the internet where i
07:02 - love to just soak up and learn lots of
07:04 - new stuff uh in many interactive lessons
07:07 - computer science physics
07:09 - there's this course called beautiful
07:10 - geometry which is amazing it's going to
07:12 - be lots of ideas of things to code in p5
07:15 - you can sign up for free at
07:16 - brilliant.org
07:18 - codingtrain
07:19 - um and if you want to unlock all of
07:22 - their uh courses and features um if you
07:25 - go through that link you will get 20 off
07:28 - the first 200 people to do so we'll get
07:29 - 20 off from the coding train i've been
07:31 - buying a lot of new equipment it's
07:33 - expensive and so by signing up by going
07:35 - to that link you're kind of helping me
07:37 - out and kind of keeping the train
07:38 - running here
07:40 - uh all right let me go back to this view
07:42 - um
07:44 - so um one thing that's a little bit
07:46 - tricky right now is that i am on a new
07:50 - home internet connection
07:52 - uh back when i was in uh streaming from
07:55 - brooklyn new york i had a fiber
07:57 - connection which was fairly reliable and
07:59 - high speed i have paid for the most
08:01 - expensive internet that i could get
08:04 - but out here um
08:06 - there is no fiber uh there's a lot of
08:09 - there's not that's just like not as much
08:11 - uh internet
08:13 - so it's a little touch and go um
08:16 - but let's see how it goes today if i
08:18 - have to come up with a different
08:19 - solution i shall
08:21 - um
08:22 - you know i had really hoped to be up and
08:25 - running more quickly
08:28 - i don't know if this is really going to
08:29 - come into fruition but i'm putting this
08:30 - into the universe
08:32 - january 2022 this is really where
08:37 - the coding train we're going to add some
08:38 - cars we're gonna add new the schedule is
08:42 - gonna be more frequent
08:44 - um so i'm uh with moving setting up a
08:48 - new studio i am teaching at nyu
08:51 - my my day job
08:53 - three courses this semester i will talk
08:55 - about those because coding train runs
08:57 - parallel with my um university teaching
09:00 - i've got a lot of commitments going on
09:02 - in the next few months my children
09:04 - though they're at school right now at
09:06 - this present time they're at school and
09:08 - they don't come home from school till
09:10 - later in the afternoon so that's
09:12 - certainly opened up quite a bit of time
09:14 - for me but i will be on sabbatical this
09:16 - spring and we'll see maybe i've got some
09:18 - maybe i'll i should be doing something
09:20 - else on sabbatical it's kind of unclear
09:23 - but part of setting up this new studio
09:24 - and and moving to this new place with
09:26 - this garage hoping to really make this
09:28 - my everyday workspace
09:30 - um to do a lot more coding train stuff
09:33 - and maybe other creative coding and
09:34 - other projects i don't know maybe i
09:37 - could start streaming other kinds of
09:39 - tutorials
09:40 - i uh beard trimming tutorials coffee
09:44 - pour over tutorials i'm trying to think
09:45 - i actually don't know about those things
09:47 - it's really nothing that i'm an expert
09:49 - in so sorry
09:51 - uh but that's coming so it's a slow
09:53 - start awkward start but i am here um
09:56 - part of today oh chris sears
10:00 - how is this even possible right's over
10:02 - here in my chat it's not my chat but in
10:05 - the discord member chat
10:07 - i'm teaching seven courses this semester
10:12 - that that blows my mind i don't even
10:14 - understand how that is humanly possible
10:17 - you my friend or a hero
10:20 - um
10:22 - school not cool you don't have a watch
10:24 - yeah i don't i don't really need
10:26 - the watch uh see soarin moderator soarin
10:29 - thank you for being a coding trained
10:31 - moderator in the chat um so let's see
10:34 - let me just try this one more time
10:35 - what's the chance
10:36 - that this has uh
10:39 - um come alive no okay
10:42 - so i don't have a plan for today i was
10:44 - kind of thinking well let me look at
10:45 - what courses i'm teaching make a plan
10:47 - let me look at some of my older plans
10:49 - simon reminded me
10:52 - i'm going to come over to this here for
10:53 - a second
10:55 - and i probably shouldn't do this but i'm
10:57 - going to go here to
11:00 - github.com codingtrain
11:05 - is it raining
11:06 - i hope it doesn't start raining because
11:08 - then poor gloria is going to get quite
11:09 - wet
11:12 - uh coding train
11:14 - uh
11:15 - rainbow topics i think
11:18 - is the name of the repository
11:24 - um where i kind of
11:27 - so this is the thing
11:29 - it's so true oh
11:31 - so true sound is much better than the
11:32 - last time so that's probably just the
11:34 - lav mic
11:35 - uh
11:38 - this space prefers the lav mic over
11:41 - uh have this i have this mic which i
11:42 - really do like i would i would certainly
11:44 - recommend it i don't want to unplug it
11:46 - it shouldn't be plugged in
11:47 - can you see it no where's the camera um
11:49 - it's like a elgato wave
11:52 - not not yet a sponsor but someday maybe
11:55 - um so a simon really rightfully pointed
11:58 - this out to me that
12:00 - i have this habit of at the beginning of
12:02 - every semester making a new markdown
12:05 - file with kind and i duplicate the
12:07 - previous ones and go through a list
12:09 - of stuff that i want to work on
12:12 - and uh
12:14 - apparently i never actually do anything
12:17 - but make the list
12:19 - so let's just look at the summer 2020 i
12:21 - won't make a new list today that's i
12:23 - guess i you know what is it the
12:24 - definition of insanity is doing the same
12:26 - thing yeah you can see like i don't
12:27 - think i've done any of these things that
12:29 - are on the list i didn't move
12:32 - this summer and i've been really working
12:34 - hard to try to keep the nature of code
12:36 - video tutorials coming out so i hope you
12:38 - don't all feel like i'm not doing
12:40 - anything i am doing stuff i'm trying
12:44 - um
12:45 - but um yeah i can see i think like all
12:47 - of these still apply so absolutely no
12:50 - point in remaking this list the cabana
12:54 - is no longer a thing it might return
12:57 - but i i do have dreams of making videos
12:59 - in a sort of different style
13:02 - like those cabana videos um uh yeah so
13:07 - these are i haven't done any of these
13:10 - yeah so great so all this stuff
13:13 - um has not nothing has been oh discord
13:16 - bot stuff
13:18 - that yeah i haven't done any of this
13:22 - so i have an idea
13:24 - this is gonna be fun ready all right
13:25 - everybody you're gonna be amazed
13:28 - watch
13:29 - what i'm about to do for you
13:31 - i'm gonna click this edit button
13:34 - i'm gonna
13:35 - type
13:36 - i don't have access to this project hold
13:38 - on
13:42 - what's going on here ah so i forgot that
13:44 - i made this very silly i attempted to
13:47 - make a youtube short
13:49 - um i don't know if anyone actually
13:52 - watched my youtube short
13:54 - i got some complaints about like why are
13:57 - you making youtube short
13:59 - not not not for you my friend um some
14:02 - people liked it uh but i i made a
14:04 - separate um github account
14:07 - um so maybe what i need to do is go back
14:11 - to
14:12 - um my
14:14 - myself sign in
14:17 - i don't know this might be a total fail
14:19 - whoa okay oh all right i'll take it
14:23 - oh no authentication code and guess
14:25 - where my
14:26 - uh
14:27 - oh i could you know what maybe i could
14:29 - get a code sent to my backup phone
14:32 - number would that help
14:33 - no okay so one issue is
14:36 - everything is a fail today oh my
14:38 - goodness this doesn't work all right
14:40 - this is good i'm gonna get my
14:41 - authentication code
14:44 - and i'll be right back
14:48 - i mean i'm not going to be very far and
14:49 - you're going to hear me the entire time
14:50 - but i'm just going to put on this sound
14:51 - i'll leave this here i'm walking to the
14:54 - side
14:55 - i'm still in a physical space where i'm
14:57 - going over to my phone which is
14:59 - tethered to the computer
15:01 - using something called elgatocam which
15:03 - totally does not work
15:05 - apparently authenticator
15:08 - looking for github
15:11 - okay i gotta memorize this in my head
15:12 - but not tell you the numbers and the
15:15 - dial is going down oh my god it's almost
15:16 - gonna run out of time
15:21 - okay
15:23 - am i gonna get it in time
15:25 - verifying yes i did it
15:30 - now
15:31 - um
15:32 - [Music]
15:36 - coming back here
15:38 - now let me see
15:41 - let me see if i oh yeah that
15:44 - the auto focus causes the desk to dance
15:46 - yeah by the way most of this i just want
15:48 - to say that most of this live stream is
15:50 - me just trying to like figure out this
15:52 - new studio but hopefully as i do this
15:56 - today and get further along more
15:58 - interesting stuff will happen
16:01 - there is a
16:03 - very dead cicada on the ground here i am
16:06 - entirely barefoot i hope you can see
16:08 - that
16:10 - uh i've got some nice rugs here
16:12 - and i'm really afraid of stepping on it
16:14 - i feel like i should do like having like
16:15 - a small little burial for it and
16:18 - say uh cicada
16:20 - say i i mean okay
16:24 - let's see there's got to be something
16:25 - here that's appropriate
16:28 - uh let me see
16:31 - no
16:34 - i want to say something
16:36 - i want to talk about the cicada over
16:38 - here
16:40 - that is lying on the floor
16:42 - cicada i don't know that i ever met you
16:44 - when you were alive but i hear your
16:46 - sounds every night
16:48 - as i walk gloria in the darkness and
16:50 - looking up at the stars and i i hope
16:52 - that you
16:53 - [Music]
16:56 - this is really happening right now
16:59 - okay i'll be right back what was i doing
17:01 - i was gonna see if i get that camera to
17:02 - work ah yes the ipad stand
17:05 - hmm
17:07 - i do have a guy
17:08 - i have four cats two are up for adoption
17:11 - someone in the chat mark booth said get
17:14 - a cat
17:15 - you're gonna be sorry you
17:16 - made that comment in a second all right
17:18 - i'm coming right back
17:22 - all right here i am
17:25 - come on epoch cam
17:27 - there's no reason why it worked all
17:29 - morning
17:30 - and then i wonder if i have to like be
17:33 - in the thing so it's like activated
17:35 - maybe i should be a little more patient
17:38 - here
17:39 - i'm gonna do this like maybe i actually
17:41 - have to leave this here
17:44 - like open
17:45 - for a short bit
17:48 - okay hold on
18:05 - all right everybody
18:09 - i guess it's really not gonna work
18:13 - [Music]
18:16 - up and down and up and down they never
18:21 - load they never load loading
18:25 - the musical broadway's back open
18:28 - when will my time be i will somehow make
18:33 - it on the stage
18:35 - [Music]
18:37 - of coding all right um
18:40 - now
18:41 - i um
18:43 - i want to talk about cats
18:46 - the brooklyn cat cafe is a non-profit
18:48 - cat cafe in new york city cat adoption
18:50 - center and social space
18:53 - all volunteer 501 c 3 organization i am
18:56 - currently my family is currently
18:57 - fostering
18:59 - uh
19:00 - where are they i'm looking for ruby
19:03 - and loki
19:05 - because anyone see ruby
19:08 - ruby
19:10 - ruby and loki here we go
19:13 - i'm gonna you you know especially you
19:15 - know you want to adopt these cute lovely
19:17 - kitties there's loki and there's ruby
19:21 - ruby is amazing oh my god the littlest
19:24 - tiniest
19:25 - creature
19:26 - um and so um
19:29 - they're sweet and relaxed pair of
19:30 - kittens who can't wait to look his most
19:31 - handsome and floofy brown taffy over
19:33 - mead will melt as soon as you pick him
19:34 - up for pets and scratches he purrs like
19:36 - so loud
19:40 - ruby is a sweet curious tiny jewel of a
19:42 - kitty look i love them very much
19:44 - but we already have two cats
19:46 - and four cats is a lot
19:50 - so i'm hoping that somebody will be very
19:52 - excited to adopt them um you can uh i
19:55 - have nothing to do with the adoption
19:56 - process i am my family is just fostering
19:58 - them uh contact the brooklyn cat cafe i
20:01 - don't know maybe you uh um and if you're
20:03 - interested that's not what you're here
20:05 - for so but you know someone did mention
20:08 - uh cats in the chat all right so
20:11 - we've established
20:13 - we've established that i am a very
20:15 - disorganized person who live streams for
20:17 - enormous amounts of time doing
20:19 - absolutely nothing and that some amount
20:21 - of people continue to watch
20:24 - i'm viewership might be going down but
20:26 - you know
20:28 - c'est la vie
20:30 - um
20:35 - bookmark your cats yeah so um
20:39 - i'm trying to set up a new studio my
20:41 - goal
20:43 - a couple things i've i've let's talk
20:44 - about news coding train news
20:54 - breaking news
20:58 - okay so it's not really breaking news
21:00 - because it's all stuff that's repeat but
21:02 - i'm it's telling you this will give you
21:04 - a sense of what's to come and it will
21:06 - help me sort of like think about what it
21:07 - is that's happening that i'm doing so
21:10 - big project
21:11 - probably won't launch until the end of
21:13 - this year early 2022 brand new coding
21:16 - train website um one thing actually i
21:18 - wonder if i can like quickly put up a
21:20 - poll
21:22 - uh and bet
21:24 - what language are you going to get today
21:27 - the language of babel rambling babble
21:30 - that's the language i'm coding in today
21:32 - maybe the poll is kind of unnecessary
21:35 - here uh what i wanted what i wanted to
21:37 - say and we can i'm not actually so first
21:38 - of all you should join the discord
21:40 - um where's that button which pastes a
21:43 - link because i will be having official
21:46 - polls
21:47 - and
21:48 - okay why is
21:49 - itunes is trying to install itself
21:52 - finish okay um great
21:56 - so you should join the discord because
21:57 - that right now i'm going to do an uh
21:59 - sort of like anecdotal poll i'm just
22:01 - going to take your temperature and talk
22:02 - through something that i'm really
22:03 - struggling with
22:05 - um
22:06 - and uh i will soon release this as a
22:10 - google form
22:11 - in the discord itself for everybody to
22:14 - vote on to get your feedback on so one
22:16 - of the things i'm trying to think about
22:18 - with the new website
22:20 - is language and oh you don't see the
22:23 - website this is the old website the
22:24 - current website it's not old it is
22:26 - actively present and new and wonderful
22:29 - but we're making some upgrades
22:32 - you can see here there are various
22:34 - headings like challenges and beginners
22:37 - and learning and more and et cetera et
22:40 - cetera et cetera so for example
22:43 - um
22:45 - what what is the what is the
22:48 - best kind of language to use for
22:50 - organizing all the content on the
22:52 - website is it very sort of literal dry
22:56 - this is what it is beginner
22:59 - how to code in peop you know beginner
23:02 - tutorials
23:03 - uh coding challenges
23:06 - uh machine learning lessons i don't know
23:09 - or
23:10 - would the website be more fun and
23:12 - approachable and would you be able to
23:13 - navigate and understand what's going on
23:15 - you know i want to have a very welcoming
23:17 - and inclusive and kind of playful
23:19 - quality to it if there were more train
23:22 - themed things like these are the tracks
23:24 - and these are the
23:26 - train cars and over here in the cafe car
23:28 - you can join the discord to chat so this
23:31 - is one of the things i'm struggling with
23:33 - i'm so i'm going to be putting out a
23:35 - survey for all sorts of kinds of naming
23:37 - ideas
23:38 - [Music]
23:39 - if you are a writer also you know you
23:42 - know i think i don't really have anyone
23:44 - at present i mean maybe that's not true
23:46 - but i'm also maybe looking for someone
23:48 - to help collaborate on this to sort of
23:49 - think about a style guide for all the
23:51 - language and the descriptions and that
23:53 - kind of thing so um i mean that maybe
23:55 - that's on me to really work on more but
23:57 - that's so that's
23:58 - news item number one new website it's
24:01 - active an active project i will be maybe
24:03 - sharing
24:04 - uh rough versions of it doing we you
24:06 - know already put out i had volunteers to
24:08 - do some preliminary user testing of some
24:10 - of the designs so your path to getting
24:13 - those sneak peeks and previews is the
24:15 - discord of course if you join as a
24:16 - member you also you might get some other
24:19 - sneak peeks and previews that i will be
24:21 - sharing as well
24:22 - so
24:23 - uh karaoke is in the uh chat hello nice
24:26 - to see you
24:28 - um
24:29 - oh yes and the discord link actually can
24:32 - be updated to discord dot gg
24:35 - coding train because we now have a
24:37 - vanity url because as we all know i am a
24:40 - very vain person
24:42 - i mean it's true i mean
24:44 - i could be making all these video
24:45 - tutorials without me in them and yet i
24:47 - choose to put me in them every single
24:49 - day of the week so what are you going to
24:51 - do it's who i am it's what i am um
24:55 - i heard a noise
24:58 - it's it's it's my dog it's okay i heard
25:01 - an animal and i got a little bit afraid
25:02 - i think there are some bears around here
25:04 - not probably wandering into the garage
25:06 - in the middle of the day but
25:07 - um yeah
25:10 - thank you soren for posting that now um
25:16 - um
25:17 - all right so
25:22 - that was that's my website item number
25:24 - one
25:26 - i had some other things in my head when
25:27 - i started this
25:29 - news oh yeah so
25:31 - i'm also trying to figure out the right
25:33 - balance between
25:36 - live streaming and um what you're
25:39 - watching right now and
25:41 - uh more polished sort of recorded video
25:44 - tutorials and um that follows certain
25:47 - sequences as well as new coding
25:49 - challenges because
25:50 - you know as many of you probably my like
25:52 - ability to produce content has severely
25:54 - slowed down i think in some
25:58 - some aspects the quality has greatly
26:01 - improved i'm always and i've been
26:03 - getting very positive feedback about
26:05 - extra diagram and animation elements and
26:09 - you know quicker editing that lets you
26:12 - watch the videos
26:14 - more quickly frankly
26:16 - and have
26:18 - different visuals that help you step
26:21 - through and understand the concepts
26:23 - um but i don't know to what extent
26:25 - um
26:26 - but i'm trying to figure out it it's a
26:28 - tricky balance now how uh you know i
26:30 - could have instead of live streaming
26:32 - today i could have just started
26:33 - recording some more coding challenges
26:36 - but i used to do the coding challenges
26:37 - in live streams and people really like
26:39 - that i don't know i don't know how to do
26:40 - any of this i'm lost and so
26:43 - uh i think if i make it to january that
26:46 - sounds very um ominous but as i plan to
26:49 - make it to january
26:50 - i will have multiple days in the week so
26:52 - maybe i can start to do all of these
26:54 - things
26:55 - um but um i think this would be a good
26:57 - time
26:58 - um since i have no plan um and i just
27:01 - thought of it too
27:04 - [Music]
27:06 - wrong track
27:08 - to talk about
27:10 - and show
27:11 - some
27:13 - uh community contributions so one of my
27:15 - favorite things and one of the things
27:16 - that i'm really hoping will make its way
27:19 - into the new website it's very loud for
27:21 - me
27:22 - um
27:23 - is hopefully it's not too loud for you
27:26 - um our ways of featuring what viewers of
27:29 - the coding train are making
27:32 - so that you can share with each other so
27:33 - you can share with me and that everybody
27:35 - can be inspired and and and welcomed
27:38 - into participating so let's take a look
27:40 - i honestly have not looked at this at
27:42 - all let's go to um
27:45 - this page
27:46 - and i want to look at some bezier curve
27:50 - community contributions i think some new
27:52 - ones have come in i certainly look i
27:55 - feel like i looked at some of these
27:56 - maybe i haven't looked it does anyone
27:58 - remember if i looked at any of these in
28:00 - a previous live stream
28:03 - uh speaking of which though what is a
28:05 - bezier curve so my new trick
28:09 - that i am about to try
28:11 - and see how this goes i do have i really
28:14 - prefer
28:14 - to use a physical whiteboard i like the
28:18 - ability to gesture to draw to move
28:21 - around to erase
28:23 - but it's um i don't have a second camera
28:25 - where i am right now i tried setting up
28:27 - my phones and connecting it and so it's
28:29 - not really working i need some more
28:31 - lights to try to light the whiteboard
28:33 - area but also there might be some value
28:35 - in me doing diagrams that can be
28:38 - captured and replayed and stored so
28:42 - what i have for you today
28:44 - uh is
28:47 - um i mean it's it's an ipad i have one
28:50 - of these uh oh it's like invisible
28:51 - pencils
28:53 - um and i think and i this is procreate
28:56 - which someone recommended to me i've no
28:57 - idea how to use it
28:59 - i don't know if anybody knows or you
29:00 - have your favorite drawing app but what
29:02 - i want to do
29:04 - is kind of
29:05 - look at and diagram what is a bezier
29:09 - curve
29:11 - this is like a very weird
29:14 - um
29:16 - this is a very weird um
29:20 - like pen thing that i'm on
29:22 - sketching inking drawing airbrushing
29:25 - textures abstract charcoals elements
29:27 - spray paints touch-ups
29:29 - luminance what do i want i just want
29:30 - drawing
29:32 - um
29:34 - but i just kind of want like a
29:35 - whiteboard marker is that like this
29:38 - ooh no no no oh that's nice though
29:42 - okay
29:43 - and now hold on how do i
29:45 - can i go to here and just make like a
29:47 - new thing
29:49 - do this
29:50 - all right
29:52 - and then procreate is the best okay so
29:54 - that's good
29:56 - uh i use this app procreate okay great
29:58 - so maybe um can somebody tell me
30:01 - what for just like a very basic pen i
30:03 - should use
30:05 - not a painting
30:07 - painting brush could work no like
30:08 - drawing is what i'm doing
30:11 - but what is just
30:12 - or am i inking
30:14 - maybe i'm inking oh yeah there we go gel
30:16 - pen studio pen marker
30:19 - marker is what but i guess i want
30:21 - something maybe a little smaller so
30:22 - let's try this gel pen
30:25 - oh yeah
30:26 - this is right
30:27 - i just wrote my name that was very
30:29 - exciting
30:30 - two fingers touch is for undo
30:33 - look at that
30:34 - that is cool
30:36 - uh and then this is like probably
30:38 - thickness
30:39 - it doesn't get very uh and so i kind of
30:42 - want it maybe something a little bit
30:43 - thicker
30:46 - gel pen studio pen marker let's try
30:49 - marker again
30:51 - and then i assume i can
30:54 - pick a color somewhere is that like this
30:56 - no whoa what does this do
30:59 - i have no idea
31:01 - okay bezier curve so let me just
31:03 - practice
31:04 - what this would be like if i'm doing
31:06 - um a little uh lesson
31:09 - okay uh bezier whoops
31:14 - i think i made it some weird color
31:17 - where's the color
31:20 - is it this oh yeah there we go
31:23 - uh
31:24 - like what if i just want
31:26 - that
31:28 - there we go
31:33 - okay uh bezier
31:36 - so i also need a much more stable stand
31:40 - i need a much more stable stand because
31:43 - um
31:46 - is moving around a lot as i draw so what
31:47 - i don't like about this is i'm looking
31:50 - down over here which probably doesn't
31:52 - bother you but as i'm drawing then i
31:54 - have to turn i'd much rather be doing
31:56 - this right
31:58 - but um
32:00 - anyway
32:01 - uh so a bezier curve
32:03 - is a particular kind of curve that
32:07 - involves interpolation and as i
32:09 - discussed in my video about bezier
32:11 - curves
32:12 - uh you know technically a um
32:17 - we have a quadratic a cubic and uh what
32:19 - was the what's the first one called i'm
32:20 - completely blanking on this
32:22 - um
32:24 - uh but you know this this is the bezier
32:26 - curve if it just has two two anchor
32:28 - points
32:29 - um it's just a line between those two
32:31 - points
32:33 - but a quadratic bezier curve
32:36 - involves a control point
32:39 - and that control point
32:42 - as you move it causes the curve to bend
32:46 - linear that's what i'm of course i was
32:48 - like it couldn't possibly be linear
32:50 - right that's so obvious um so now
32:54 - oh it's a lot of undo there if i were to
32:56 - add a second control point
32:58 - then
32:59 - that causes the curve to bend down here
33:01 - and up here et cetera so but so by the
33:04 - way this is me just practicing trying to
33:06 - explain stuff with diagrams
33:10 - so and this is uh cubic
33:16 - smiley face
33:18 - oh i could draw this could be like a cat
33:20 - with like some whiskers
33:24 - how's this going everybody
33:26 - so uh my uh video
33:29 - uh it where i uh use an actual
33:31 - whiteboard and show some code examples
33:34 - and talk through everything there is to
33:35 - be on betsy carson this is one of the
33:36 - more popular videos that i've recently
33:39 - released um at least initially videos
33:42 - have these very strange lives to them so
33:45 - um
33:47 - they get a sort of burst of viewership
33:48 - when i first released them and sometimes
33:51 - that burst of viewership kind of takes
33:53 - off in a pretty
33:55 - strong way bezier curve video being
33:58 - quite a good example of that but still
34:00 - um usually if even if it's doing really
34:03 - well in its sort of initial burst
34:04 - somewhere between like 50 and 100 000
34:06 - views which is tremendous i'm very
34:08 - thrilled with that um other videos
34:10 - like the wander video i recently
34:12 - released which is i'll get to next which
34:14 - is like in the middle of a sequence of
34:16 - many videos they don't tend to take off
34:18 - with that kind of burst whatever youtube
34:21 - magic is happening
34:22 - um
34:24 - it's just not picked up as much but then
34:26 - strangely
34:28 - videos that i have will just a year
34:30 - later or two years later
34:32 - sometimes like take on this life of
34:34 - their own and so the example of what's
34:36 - happening right now is a star let me
34:39 - search for like this a star coding train
34:40 - video um this one is just like
34:43 - consistent this is from 2017 is
34:46 - consistently the most pop viewed video
34:48 - right now every week every day on my
34:50 - channel it might have come down i
34:52 - haven't actually looked in like
34:53 - maybe like three or four days but um
34:56 - this is also pretty interesting that the
34:58 - search for this video is actually this i
35:00 - don't think these are tied to
35:02 - well maybe i don't i don't believe these
35:04 - older videos are time coded
35:06 - um code the title coding challenge has
35:09 - something to do with that that's
35:10 - interesting yeah and i i often think
35:13 - that what i probably should do is have
35:14 - and i don't want to do this
35:16 - but like if i were trying to optimize
35:18 - towards the strongest viewership
35:21 - i would actually just have a channel
35:24 - that's only the coding challenges so
35:26 - that people could subscribe only to that
35:28 - and that youtube's understanding of my
35:31 - content would be like oh people like
35:33 - every video because what happens is i
35:35 - release a coding challenge it's like
35:36 - recommended more and more and then i do
35:38 - one that's like i think really important
35:40 - and part of a sequence but it doesn't
35:41 - get as much viewership so then the next
35:43 - coding challenge is like well people
35:45 - aren't as interested anymore so maybe
35:46 - it'll be a little bit less it's like
35:47 - this never-ending cycle um i i'm trying
35:49 - not to be obsessed with this stuff you
35:51 - know it's it's really not the primary my
35:54 - primary sort of incentive or motivation
35:57 - but it's so hard not to get caught up in
36:00 - it and i understand that for other
36:01 - people
36:02 - um you know who are doing this youtube
36:04 - stuff much more full-time
36:07 - it can be much more of a primary driver
36:08 - an incentive okay snake game yes coding
36:11 - challenge number three the snake game
36:12 - most viewed video of mine at least of
36:15 - all time
36:16 - um all right so uh bezier curve
36:19 - i wanted to look at community
36:20 - contributions
36:21 - so let's see i honestly don't remember
36:23 - if i looked at any of these
36:24 - but um so i want to just look at all of
36:26 - these that are here and encourage you to
36:28 - submit your own
36:29 - um let's look at synth wave
36:32 - animation by chris sears who i know is
36:35 - at least was previously in the chat
36:37 - so let's take a look at this
36:39 - and see what happens loading loading
36:41 - loading loading
36:43 - whoa
36:47 - whoa i have i think i saw this but i
36:49 - definitely didn't look at this on stream
36:52 - because
36:53 - wow
37:00 - this is wild
37:03 - so um now i'm trying to even like
37:05 - understand how this is based off of my
37:08 - sketch i mean i guess i see it here this
37:10 - is my visualization of the
37:13 - quadratic bezier and with the sort of
37:16 - random motion but it's now mapped into a
37:18 - 3d space i feel like i'm like looking at
37:21 - a scene from tron or something
37:24 - this is amazing
37:25 - uh really cool stuff oh and there's
37:27 - music
37:29 - i don't hear it
37:31 - so
37:32 - um
37:34 - you know i'm i would love to it's
37:37 - probably like the way i have all my
37:38 - audio routing going on it's probably why
37:40 - the music is not being heard so
37:42 - apologies for that but it's probably
37:43 - better for me not to play the music on
37:45 - stream anyway uh but this is quite
37:48 - amazing this to me is the in uh it's
37:51 - just like the epitome of why i love
37:52 - doing this because i don't think when i
37:55 - was making my bezier curve example i
37:57 - ever would have thought of this visual
37:59 - application but i think there's so much
38:01 - um you know a bezier wander this on its
38:04 - own is wonderful but now this is leading
38:06 - me to think of so many different ideas
38:08 - yeah it's a great like uh
38:10 - yeah why t brent can ask is that the
38:11 - information super highway
38:14 - no but i could imagine this being like a
38:15 - nice visual for
38:17 - um you know some opening credits of of
38:20 - um some type of game or or other type of
38:23 - content yeah okay um thank you um turn
38:27 - click the canvas during the tangent
38:28 - lines ah
38:30 - oh fascinating so i i can't resist how
38:33 - much i love looking at this with the
38:35 - tangent lines and the colors
38:37 - but this also has a really nice
38:41 - uh quality to it
38:43 - now the move one thing that could be
38:45 - really interesting to experiment with it
38:47 - just occurred to me um it looks like
38:49 - this is probably based off of the random
38:52 - motion that's in my example where i'm
38:54 - just showing like okay see you can move
38:56 - the control points around the curve
38:57 - changes
38:58 - i don't know this to be true we could
39:00 - look at the code obviously but um i
39:02 - wonder if there were some type of um
39:06 - [Music]
39:07 - you know set of rules for the motion so
39:10 - that you know what if it were sine waves
39:12 - or purl and noise those are the obvious
39:13 - ones to start with but so that there's a
39:15 - connection as i'm moving through this
39:17 - space i'm seeing these rippling motions
39:19 - as each curve passes over me sort of
39:22 - passing its motion on to the next
39:25 - um so great great job um
39:28 - uh a bell and a
39:31 - train whistle for um this wonderful
39:33 - community contribution
39:35 - uh closing this one out and going on to
39:38 - bezier curve road editor i remember
39:41 - david telling me about this one so let's
39:43 - take a look
39:44 - [Music]
39:48 - what do i do here
39:50 - shift click to add points to the path
39:54 - so this is using the fact that you can
39:58 - uh chain
40:00 - the bezier curves together so if i go
40:01 - back to
40:03 - um i want a really quick way just to
40:04 - make a new page i guess right now the
40:06 - only way i know how to do this
40:08 - like there must be like in this can i
40:10 - have like multiple pages
40:13 - i can do cut and paste ah like can i
40:15 - make a like how do i make a new okay i'm
40:18 - gonna have to learn how to use this app
40:19 - later right now i'm just gonna do this
40:21 - um so one of the things that's really
40:23 - awesome about bezier curves i mentioned
40:25 - right we have two anchor points
40:28 - and two control points
40:32 - but um a bezier vertex just involves
40:37 - these three points here
40:39 - right that makes the entire bezier
40:41 - vertex like this is the next point we're
40:43 - going to but these control points and
40:46 - i'm sorry i really miss drew this
40:47 - because the curve doesn't pass through
40:49 - the control points that's a kind of
40:50 - common misconception or at least it's a
40:52 - misconception that i make so
40:54 - um oh wait what did i just do did i just
40:56 - change the color to white again
40:59 - what just happened
41:00 - right i don't know what's going on i
41:02 - obviously do not know how to use this
41:03 - piece of software
41:05 - i can have layers in procreate okay so
41:08 - um
41:10 - what's the bezier cat
41:13 - i don't was that the thing that i drew i
41:15 - have no idea what's going on anyway so
41:17 - these are doing a terrible job here
41:19 - these are the elements of the next
41:21 - vertex which means if i wanted to add
41:23 - another vertex i only need three more
41:25 - elements which would cause it to curve
41:26 - like this and then i could put
41:28 - three more elements and when i say
41:30 - element i mean three more points so the
41:32 - vertex the bezier vertex is a collection
41:35 - of three vertices the and i guess this
41:38 - little
41:39 - um it's it's where i am going to like if
41:43 - it were just oh wait what just happened
41:47 - um
41:50 - that was just an extra right
41:52 - it's where i'm going to like if i didn't
41:53 - have a bezier vertex i would just be
41:56 - going to the next vertex but because i
41:57 - do i'm kind of like curving around i
42:00 - have no idea what this would actually do
42:01 - with those two control points so super
42:03 - exciting
42:05 - so this looks like uh what
42:08 - david has done here and i believe the
42:10 - idea
42:11 - if i'm correct is
42:14 - ah yes look at this
42:16 - using bezier curves to create a drop
42:20 - like a road essentially and this would
42:22 - be a perfect
42:24 - complement to what i eventually someday
42:27 - will hopefully actually make i built a
42:29 - version of this during a live stream a
42:31 - while ago with an idea to make it as a
42:32 - multi-part
42:34 - set of video tutorials but i
42:36 - want to use ml5 the javascript machine
42:39 - learning library that i uh helped to
42:43 - maintain
42:45 - to train and ai in big quotes to drive
42:49 - along
42:50 - this path so
42:52 - dreams uh
42:54 - that's like a great project for the
42:55 - spring if i can get back to that
42:58 - wonderful work
42:59 - thank you for this
43:00 - david all right moving along
43:03 - uh everyone gets a bell
43:05 - and a train whistle now we're going to
43:07 - look at bezier curve lerp animations 2
43:09 - to 10 points by
43:11 - narayana
43:16 - okay gotta love this so one of the
43:19 - aspects of something that i emphasized
43:21 - in my video tutorial is how the bezier
43:25 - curve
43:27 - is
43:28 - the math behind the bezier curve is all
43:31 - about linear interpolation so linear
43:34 - interpolation between just two points is
43:36 - that line
43:38 - um and
43:40 - um but once i add that control point i'm
43:43 - then interpolating the interpolation
43:46 - between the anchor to control and the
43:47 - control to anchor so you can sort of see
43:49 - this playing out here in this animation
43:52 - so for example i think it'll be more
43:54 - obvious if i go to two points
43:56 - right there's i love how this
43:58 - demonstrates the idea so well this is
44:00 - linear interpolation from one point to
44:03 - another
44:04 - let's add one control point so now this
44:07 - is linear interpolation see how that's
44:10 - what that one point is interpolating
44:11 - between these two and the other one is
44:13 - interpolating between the other two and
44:14 - then between those two we've got this
44:16 - nice curve
44:17 - and is this the thing that i can move
44:19 - these points around no but it doesn't
44:20 - matter this is so wonderful i'm so
44:22 - excited about this
44:24 - now if i go to four this is what we're
44:26 - typically seeing as the cubic
44:28 - bezier but
44:30 - okay this is very exciting this really
44:35 - this merits a nice drum roll here let's
44:37 - go to five
44:39 - oh my god oh my goodness
44:42 - oh i'm getting
44:43 - getting a little warm over here oh
44:46 - that's wild
44:48 - oh that is so amazing
44:50 - um
44:52 - i i uh six
44:57 - this is so cool
45:00 - all right i i think i might be getting a
45:02 - delivery
45:03 - do you hear that beeping of the truck
45:04 - backing up
45:07 - uh
45:08 - okay and and and simon in the chat is
45:10 - telling like quartic
45:12 - um there's quintic there's all these
45:15 - different terms let's go let's just jump
45:16 - all the way to 10
45:18 - because
45:19 - i don't know how else to experience this
45:23 - amazing
45:25 - uh that is wild let's let's do 10 with
45:28 - random points
45:32 - um yeah i see a a delivery truck
45:34 - hopefully they're just gonna drop it off
45:35 - and don't need me
45:37 - um
45:41 - wow
45:43 - this is wild
45:44 - so i'm distracted by the delivery truck
45:48 - but not to mention this incredible uh
45:52 - variation off of
45:54 - the bezier video
46:00 - okay
46:03 - thank you for this it's incredible a
46:05 - huge round of applause can we do that
46:06 - also
46:10 - all right now moving along
46:13 - um i'm almost to 11 30 which is my
46:16 - halfway point so recently the rhythm of
46:18 - these live streams have been um me
46:21 - babbling for a bit showing some
46:23 - community contributions taking a break
46:25 - and coming back and coding something i
46:27 - have a couple ideas maybe i'll when i
46:29 - after i take a break i'll put a poll up
46:31 - um
46:33 - and yes i know there's a whole live poll
46:36 - system that was engineered by many
46:39 - wonderful generous contributors of
46:40 - coding training
46:42 - i can never seem to figure out how to
46:44 - use
46:45 - um which is totally my fault um and
46:48 - but now there's just this pull button in
46:50 - the youtube chat i can walk over here
46:51 - and set a poll
46:52 - all right i am going to go to curve art
46:55 - by larry campfire
46:58 - let's take a look at this one
47:00 - whoa okay i did not know
47:03 - that this was going to be me so wait i
47:05 - don't understand this
47:10 - is wild okay wait i have to understand
47:12 - how this is done
47:13 - so first of all what picture is that
47:19 - gloria
47:20 - [Music]
47:21 - i wish i need a dog cam
47:23 - so what picture is this i have no idea i
47:25 - mean obviously it's a picture of me but
47:26 - i don't remember it's like this is a
47:28 - picture that's released on the internet
47:30 - somewhere probably um
47:32 - so
47:33 - this looks like it is a uh what's
47:36 - happening here if i can understand this
47:38 - correctly
47:39 - and um
47:42 - i'm going to attempt to diagram my
47:44 - understanding of this
47:46 - so there is an image
47:50 - and it has an image as a grid of pixels
47:54 - so each pixel
47:56 - has some brightness value so imagine the
47:58 - image is gray scale and the brightness
48:00 - values are like
48:02 - five okay this is too thick i guess
48:04 - 110 i can do this right make it thinner
48:07 - you know 255
48:10 - 100
48:11 - 0 10 right you could imagine this
48:14 - grid of pixels
48:16 - um
48:18 - each with a grayscale value so i think
48:20 - maybe what's going on is then
48:23 - this is visualized
48:26 - right so normally you would take the
48:28 - grace if we're visualizing the data of
48:31 - an image i would take the grayscale
48:33 - value and i would
48:35 - render it as a block of pixels with that
48:38 - value
48:39 - at that spot
48:42 - that's what an image is it's really just
48:44 - a visualization of the data the color
48:46 - being tied to well typically like an rgb
48:48 - value perhaps with an alpha but in here
48:51 - just the grayscale example a single
48:52 - number a gray value but many other
48:55 - things
48:56 - can be
48:57 - mapped to
48:59 - color to represent the image and you
49:02 - know i think a very a well-known um
49:05 - example of this is even in the sort of
49:07 - like physical world is danny rosen's
49:09 - work
49:10 - you can see here these like amazing
49:12 - physical
49:13 - uh sculptures that take uh you know like
49:17 - little blocks of wood and rotate them to
49:20 - reflect light in different ways to
49:21 - create that pixel view
49:23 - um you know i'm trying to i love this
49:25 - one the like um
49:28 - it's these
49:29 - uh little penguins fuzzy penguins that
49:31 - like spin around so if they're facing
49:33 - you from their back they're dark uh
49:36 - facing you uh from the front they're
49:38 - bright so i really encourage you to
49:39 - check out danny rosen's work um if
49:41 - you're not familiar um look at all these
49:44 - videos that have obviously and links
49:45 - that have a tremendous amount more
49:47 - information so what's happening here i
49:49 - think is something similar of course
49:51 - it's still software and screen based so
49:52 - you can imagine doing this with like
49:54 - string or something but i think what's
49:57 - happening here is like if it is
49:59 - um
50:00 - a bright pixel
50:03 - maybe just a line is drawn
50:06 - and then if it's a darker pixel
50:09 - that line is if i zoom in
50:13 - it's bent
50:15 - so it like um
50:17 - would
50:19 - this is hard i don't really have my
50:21 - it would kind of like
50:24 - do this
50:25 - does it and that makes it like thicker
50:27 - or something so i i'd have to like try
50:29 - to figure this out but there's some kind
50:31 - of mapping
50:32 - of the grayscale pixel value to the
50:36 - uh curvature of the bezier curve itself
50:39 - i was thinking is the line getting
50:41 - thicker no it's just more pixels are
50:43 - being filled in because the curve has
50:45 - more
50:46 - uh the length of the curve there's more
50:48 - uh it's longer there's more space for it
50:51 - to fill and that by definition creates
50:54 - this sort of darker
50:56 - look to it so that's really wild i don't
50:58 - know that just would not have occurred
50:59 - to me
51:00 - to do that so what would be cool let's
51:02 - just see i'm just really curious
51:04 - um i want to take a version of this
51:09 - let me log in as coding train if you
51:11 - will indulge me for a second
51:15 - i don't know if this font is too small
51:18 - but
51:19 - and again i just want to emphasize this
51:22 - is um
51:23 - i am taking a larry campfire's example
51:26 - and i just want to see what it looks
51:28 - like with video so i'm going to say i'm
51:30 - going to add video
51:32 - let's comment out the image
51:34 - comment out preload
51:36 - and i'm going to say i know maybe it
51:38 - will take too long
51:41 - to run but let's let's we'll find out oh
51:43 - these are quadratic beziers so i was
51:45 - trying to in my attempt to think about
51:47 - it as a cubic bezier let's say uh create
51:50 - video actually let's just leave this as
51:52 - is with both the image just
51:55 - um
51:56 - create video
51:58 - uh create capture
52:00 - video so let's make sure this works
52:05 - so now i should have both this image and
52:08 - you can see there we are by the way so
52:09 - this is what it really looks like in
52:10 - here it's just a green curtain
52:13 - with a lot of lights and a much nicer
52:15 - camera than the webcam but that's what i
52:18 - look like standing here i
52:20 - one thing that i'm very unsure about so
52:22 - i need a haircut i don't always i don't
52:24 - need to wear a hat in every video but
52:25 - it's you can see this is a mess right
52:27 - now i'm a mess
52:29 - but uh lighting wise i'm just like i
52:31 - don't know if i have the right
52:32 - temperature lighting temperature
52:34 - settings on the camera anybody wants to
52:35 - help me with that i'm game but um okay
52:38 - so i should be able to
52:42 - figure out a way
52:44 - so this is using scale times image so
52:47 - let's do this
52:48 - i'm going to say
52:50 - uh
52:52 - video equals create capture and i want
52:54 - to take off the auto refresh and stop it
52:56 - so i'm going to make the
52:58 - video size i wanted to make it something
53:00 - that i know
53:02 - uh oh
53:03 - so it's actually multiplying up so let's
53:05 - make it like 40 let's take it 40 by 30.
53:09 - and let's just do the scale scale is
53:11 - eight i think that'll work is that going
53:14 - to be too slow i'm going to take out the
53:16 - no loop
53:20 - and so image should then
53:23 - where is it getting the pixel color
53:26 - it should be video ah so one thing will
53:29 - be this is an issue
53:31 - so it worked just fine because it was
53:33 - only doing it once
53:35 - but um
53:37 - using the get function to get the pixel
53:39 - color can be incredibly slow if you're
53:43 - doing it over every single pixel as
53:45 - opposed to just working with the pixel
53:47 - array directly but let's see what
53:49 - happens what's the worst thing that's
53:51 - going to happen let me try running this
53:53 - let me just comment out image so it'll
53:55 - throw an error if that's being used
53:56 - somewhere else
53:58 - and see what happens
54:00 - oh okay image is not defined right so i
54:02 - think what i'm going to do
54:04 - is just hard code in
54:06 - for right now
54:09 - what i know the size to be
54:13 - obviously i could pick it up from the
54:14 - video and then i got an error probably
54:16 - because the video isn't ready
54:20 - image is not defined no there's still
54:21 - another place where i'm using image
54:26 - ah okay
54:29 - this might throw an error because the
54:31 - video might not be ready
54:35 - oh nope totally working
54:39 - you can see it's totally working just
54:40 - running incredibly slow so is the
54:43 - slowness
54:44 - um just the bezier drawing the bezier
54:47 - curves themselves
54:49 - or
54:50 - i have to stop
54:51 - or can i get around that slowness
54:54 - by getting rid of that get function so
54:57 - the way to get rid of that get function
55:00 - i think gloria might have gotten tangled
55:04 - hold on everybody
55:06 - pause to help my poor
55:08 - no no she's not tangled she's not
55:10 - tangled okay she's on like a leash oops
55:13 - i'm okay um so what i can do instead is
55:16 - i should be able to say
55:18 - uh
55:19 - r equals video dot pixels
55:23 - the index plus zero so this is something
55:26 - i've covered
55:27 - uh like probably you know a thousand
55:30 - times
55:31 - um
55:33 - but i since i have this
55:38 - whiteboard thing here i'll do it again
55:40 - so let's just say these are my pixels
55:45 - they have row column numbers 0 1 2
55:48 - row numbers 0 1 2 but the actual pixel
55:52 - number is 0 1 2
55:55 - 3 4 5
55:57 - 6 7 8. so if i need to get the index 4
56:00 - for example i can actually just say what
56:02 - is its x value which is 1
56:05 - plus what is its row or y value which is
56:08 - also 1
56:10 - times the width which is 3. so in this
56:12 - case you can see that makes sense
56:14 - because 1 plus 3 is 4. 1 plus 3 is 4 4
56:17 - plus 3 is 7. so i'm going to add that
56:18 - formula
56:20 - into this code here
56:22 - saying index
56:23 - equals x plus y
56:26 - times
56:27 - times video dot with now here's the
56:30 - catch
56:31 - so while this is true
56:34 - this diagram that i've done is
56:35 - absolutely true
56:37 - there's actually four values in the
56:40 - array in each one of these spots and i
56:42 - did that wrong because there's r
56:45 - wait what
56:47 - why is it sometimes just change to white
56:49 - what am i doing am i like triggering an
56:51 - eraser i am i switch the eraser i see um
56:54 - there's an r a g a b and an alpha so red
56:58 - green blue and alpha
57:00 - so
57:02 - what i actually have to do is take that
57:04 - index
57:05 - which is which pixel am i on and
57:08 - multiply it by four because i've got to
57:10 - advance for every four spots can you
57:12 - hear gloria barking by the way does that
57:14 -  come in through the mic
57:16 - um
57:18 - i wonder if i can just
57:20 - i have not tried a stream ming i've
57:22 - worked in here but
57:24 - usually she'll she'll come or i'll go
57:26 - and check on her but
57:29 - um
57:31 - so this should give me
57:34 - the red green and blue values instead of
57:37 - using get by going directly into the
57:40 - array
57:41 - and then i could should just be able to
57:42 - replace them here with r this is a very
57:45 - fancy way i'm always so lazy and i just
57:48 - get the
57:49 - grayscale value by adding them up and
57:52 - dividing it by three the average of the
57:54 - rg and b but this looks like i guess
57:56 - this is probably using like luminosity
57:58 - or something it's using a larger
57:59 - percentage of the red value
58:02 - um
58:04 - wait what
58:05 - times r times yeah
58:07 - um 21 no no of the green value 21 of the
58:11 - red value 72 percent of the green value
58:13 - and seven percent of the b let's see if
58:14 - this uh improves anything
58:23 - i messed something up
58:27 - what did i do wrong
58:36 - i mean i thought i didn't have to do
58:38 - this do i need to call load pixels i
58:40 - think i do
58:41 - i think i have to call load pixels
58:44 - i know why i thought i didn't need to do
58:45 - that
58:46 - oh yeah look at that
58:51 - so see how much that improved the speed
58:54 - so now we're able to do this in real
58:56 - time oh i love this
58:58 - lovely look at this it's so
59:01 - cool now i think what i could do
59:03 - is make the scale let's see how
59:06 - could i do 80 by
59:09 - 60 or is that going to be much too slow
59:10 - let's give it a try
59:13 - um
59:18 - let's just do this to be a little bit
59:20 - more thoughtful about it
59:24 - um
59:28 - oh yeah okay
59:31 - let's just see if this works
59:33 - this might be too slow from a drawing
59:35 - standpoint yeah you can see now this is
59:36 - too slow from a drawing standpoint but
59:38 - it's actually kind of nicer with it and
59:41 - i think what i might like to do is even
59:42 - lower it and then just make the scale
59:46 - like 32
59:47 - let's try
59:48 - that's probably too extreme let's try
59:50 - 16.
59:55 - let's try 24.
60:00 - and i guess i guess 40 by 30 was a
60:03 - little bit nicer
60:05 - um
60:07 - where is there a stroke weight somewhere
60:09 - begin shape no fill
60:11 - stroke weight i'm just curious to like
60:12 - bump up the stroke weight a little bit
60:18 - and let's hit stop and let's try looking
60:21 - at this
60:23 - in
60:24 - full screen mode
60:26 - i know i'm taking quite a bit of time
60:28 - here
60:30 - huh
60:31 - what happened there
60:37 - cool kind of slow but still pretty wild
60:46 - all right
60:48 - thank you simon i'm like looking for my
60:49 - watch
60:50 - all right uh it is now uh officially the
60:53 - midpoint of today's a stream i do have a
60:57 - pretty much i really do need to stop by
60:58 - like 12 30.
61:00 - um
61:01 - i i hope that this is um that you are
61:04 - enjoying today so far let's uh thank you
61:07 - uh so much to ah
61:14 - um
61:15 - to uh larry campfire for that let's go
61:18 - to ah quartic bezier curve
61:21 - exciting by codefish and i apologize
61:23 - that i'm gonna end up you know kind of
61:25 - looking at some of these more quickly
61:27 - but this is core tick right because it
61:30 - has
61:30 - three control points
61:33 - great work working that out wonderful
61:35 - job code fish
61:38 - uh you responded perfectly to the prompt
61:40 - in my video and i am so happy
61:42 - uh let us go now to animated and control
61:46 - point bezier curve by alex hunter
61:51 - and
61:52 - what do i do here i click
61:54 - oh wild
61:57 - so i can just keep adding points
62:00 - and then i can speed it up whoa
62:03 - oh that is wild
62:05 - oh amazing so this is very much like
62:06 - what we saw before
62:08 - but now i have the ability to i um reset
62:12 - um
62:13 - to just actually just make my own points
62:16 - like if i go in a circle what happens
62:21 - and then uh also
62:23 - play around with the speed
62:25 - so have it run very very slowly or very
62:27 - very quickly
62:28 - amazing job
62:30 - this is all great
62:32 - a lot of breath from that uh now we are
62:34 - going to moving on an infinite loop made
62:37 - with bezier curves
62:40 - i might regret this but
62:42 - i'm kind of excited just by the title of
62:44 - that
62:53 - here we go
63:03 - oh there's a fly
63:06 - hmm
63:07 - error
63:12 - not sure what happened you know this
63:14 - full screen thing sometimes does mess
63:16 - things up
63:18 - i've noticed recently
63:19 - ah there we go
63:23 - awesome oh so it's like the infinity
63:26 - symbol
63:27 - somehow made with bezier curves and i
63:30 - love this little dot look how it's like
63:34 - i'm going to do sound effects for this
63:35 - [Music]
63:37 - somehow that speed which is going is
63:38 - this an illusion it's actually always
63:40 - moving at the same speed or no i believe
63:42 - it's slowing down it's probably
63:43 - following the actual interpolation
63:45 - wow
63:47 - so let's take a look here
63:50 - oh i see i see oh it's using the vehicle
63:54 - oh amazing somehow this is using
63:57 - something from nature of code oh no
64:00 - the vehicle yeah it's got like a vehicle
64:03 - in it somehow which is a great segue
64:06 - because the i don't know that anyone has
64:09 - made a community contribution for this
64:11 - yet because the video was just released
64:13 - yesterday but if you haven't watched my
64:15 - most recent
64:17 - video release on the coding train it is
64:20 - [Music]
64:22 - part of the nature of code series
64:25 - um all the way down here we have i'm you
64:28 - know i'm on this quest as i mentioned in
64:30 - the video to implement every single
64:34 - um
64:36 - craig reynolds steering behaviors i'm
64:38 - curious what people if people like these
64:39 - kind of goofy thumbnails that sort of
64:41 - like show little uh uh this triangle
64:44 - character kind of acting out but this
64:46 - particular wander behavior
64:48 - um we can see here yes look at this
64:53 - it seems like there haven't been made
64:56 - any variations based on this lesson see
64:58 - that's a very awkward sentence i
65:00 - probably wrote that sentence at one
65:02 - point but this is what i need i need to
65:04 - re really work on rewriting the language
65:06 - for the website and is the community
65:08 - contribution a community contribution or
65:10 - is it like a passenger's
65:12 - [Music]
65:14 - ticket no that doesn't make sense i
65:16 - don't know that's what i'm trying to
65:17 - figure out
65:18 - but yes there are no community
65:19 - contributions yet yet uh yet but you
65:22 - could be the first one you could submit
65:23 - it today i will be looking at them this
65:25 - afternoon on my own and i could come
65:26 - back and show them in a future live
65:27 - stream
65:29 - if you want help figuring out how to do
65:30 - that i would definitely join the discord
65:33 - which i just posted a link in the chat
65:35 - but let's take a look just at the
65:36 - various examples
65:38 - one of the things that i wanted to show
65:39 - you that i made for this video which
65:41 - wasn't part of the actual um
65:44 - coding itself and why is this so did i
65:47 - zoom in on this or something yes there
65:48 - we go um let me see can i drag this over
65:52 - i try to try to do this in 3d
65:55 - so one thing i was really pleased about
65:58 - is and so what is what is going on here
66:01 - um
66:02 - basically um the wander algorithm
66:06 - involves a vehicle
66:08 - and it needs to decide which way should
66:10 - it steer
66:11 - and the way that it decides is it
66:14 - projects a point out in front of it
66:16 - uh creates a circle at that point's
66:19 - location
66:21 - then projects a point out onto
66:23 - uh the edge of that circle and then
66:26 - steers in that direction then this point
66:28 - moves randomly over time
66:31 - and so what the result there is instead
66:34 - of just like making a lot of random
66:35 - motions sure that point might be moving
66:37 - randomly over time but it's not going to
66:40 - cause the vehicle itself to make a
66:42 - drastic change in direction until maybe
66:44 - it gets all the way back down like over
66:46 - here over here so it's a very effective
66:48 - way uh no no this is not where i'm
66:50 - swiping ah
66:51 - this is where i'm swiping
66:53 - so this is like i was trying to do this
66:55 - in 3d uh i think i might need everybody
66:58 - just prepare yourself
67:01 - i'm going to say something
67:03 - it's going to be a little bit scary i'm
67:04 - going to try to stay standing here not
67:06 - go anywhere i might need
67:08 - quaternions
67:10 - um to really figure out how to get my
67:12 - vehicle pointing in the right direction
67:14 - but um anyway i was curious if somebody
67:16 - has a better take on how to do this in
67:17 - 3d and visualize it i would love a
67:19 - contribution in that uh um
67:23 - vane
67:24 - i'm trying to think if there's anything
67:26 - else here i think this is kind of maybe
67:29 - a useful one to just for me to show you
67:31 - um you know think about how so this is
67:33 - the actual algorithm uh wander algorithm
67:35 - playing out
67:37 - and one of the things that i did with
67:38 - this is that i just attached some
67:40 - sliders so we could sort of see like how
67:42 - does it look if that circle cup becomes
67:43 - closer
67:44 - um or if that circle is much bigger
67:49 - um as well as i don't know what this one
67:51 - is oh the dismount of displacement is
67:53 - like bigger so this is a much more like
67:56 - actively changing direction wander
67:58 - versus if i were to put all these
68:00 - sliders down
68:02 - i would assume that with everything low
68:05 - um it's going to kind of move in the
68:07 - same and it's when i say move in the
68:08 - same direction it's not actually
68:11 - resolving to moving straight it's
68:13 - continuing to turn the same way for a
68:14 - while and then turn another way so
68:16 - there's a lot of
68:18 - possibilities for this i hope that you
68:20 - get a chance to explore this particular
68:22 - video tutorial and submit your community
68:26 - contributions so they could show up here
68:27 - i would love that so much
68:32 - how's everybody doing how is this stream
68:33 - so far um
68:35 - on a scale
68:40 - uh
68:42 - how is this
68:45 - is this stream on a scale of one to five
68:52 - oh i can only get four
68:54 - i guess so four is um
69:00 - four would be you really this is the
69:02 - best stream i've ever seen and one would
69:04 - be like
69:05 - you know
69:06 - [Music]
69:09 - i've liked previous streams that i've
69:10 - watched quite a bit more
69:12 - i don't know why i'm asking this it's a
69:14 - very
69:15 - dangerous thing that i've done like
69:17 - self-indulgent thing that i've done
69:20 - so but i would like a lot of feedback
69:21 - because i'm trying to figure out like
69:23 - what am i really doing here
69:26 - again my i think the way that i think of
69:28 - the
69:29 - universe of coding train content
69:32 - individual project videos coding
69:34 - challenges tracks i'm calling them
69:36 - tracks which are more like courses
69:38 - beginner beginner lessons um and you can
69:41 - see those if you're if you are a
69:43 - beginner um these are the ones where
69:45 - that you can start with on the website
69:48 - as well as some other tracks that are
69:50 - more themed around machine learning or
69:51 - physics simulation
69:53 - i am working hard to try to um
69:58 - record these and release them with
70:00 - good production value
70:02 - and then also live streaming once a week
70:05 - which is me just interacting with the
70:06 - community answering questions showing
70:08 - community contributions and what i'm
70:10 - doing today and then always programming
70:13 - something kind of new which is what i'm
70:15 - going to do in the second half even
70:16 - though i have no idea what i'm going to
70:17 - do yet
70:19 - so that's kind of i i would love to hear
70:21 - about like i'm trying to really be more
70:23 - sort of thoughtful and organized about
70:25 - how all the stuff is going i did not eat
70:27 - a very big breakfast this morning i'm
70:29 - starting to feel
70:31 - feel the um
70:34 - it's starting to punish me here a little
70:36 - bit as i cannot form words all right so
70:38 - um before i take a break it is time for
70:41 - me to mention to you um sponsor
70:44 - brilliant so
70:46 - um if you like learning
70:48 - and if you like learning from really
70:50 - well done
70:51 - exciting and interesting resources that
70:54 - you can find on the internet um
70:57 - like the coding train hopefully
70:59 - you are really going to like brilliant
71:01 - and i think brilliant the reason why i'm
71:03 - so pleased to have brilliant as a
71:04 - sponsor is it is a really wonderful
71:07 - compliment to what i do so here's what
71:09 - i'm doing talking at you
71:13 - attempting to draw diagrams blah blah
71:15 - blah blah blah trying to write some code
71:17 - here and there but if you would prefer
71:19 - to be a little bit more self-paced to
71:21 - have some quiet time on your own whether
71:23 - on your computer or through an app
71:25 - brilliant has both of those for lots of
71:27 - interactive lessons so a couple of the
71:29 - courses do they have daily challenges i
71:32 - should go to the brilliant website which
71:33 - i will do
71:34 - um
71:35 - they have daily challenges and they have
71:38 - a whole set of courses like if i just
71:40 - click on this page it's like everything
71:41 - that i love is all here
71:44 - geometry neural networks statistics
71:46 - logic computer science fundamentals
71:49 - and one of the things that i really love
71:51 - about it i'm going to go here to the um
71:54 - like the al the out one of the algorithm
71:56 - algorithm fundamentals course i believe
71:58 - this is um is that the lessons not only
72:01 - are oh let me read through this material
72:04 - and see what's there are actually
72:06 - allowing you to interact and so if you
72:08 - want to learn more about coding you can
72:10 - see like figuring out pseudo code and
72:12 - logic checking your answers stepping
72:14 - through these interactive lessons that's
72:16 - really a wonderful thing to do
72:18 - ah yes this is um this is the course
72:20 - that i'm really excited about here um
72:23 - and what you um like that so many of the
72:25 - courses involve these really fun visual
72:28 - dynamic puzzles um really to teach a
72:30 - particular concept like if you if you
72:33 - maybe you know the formula for the
72:34 - pythagorean theorem a squared plus b
72:36 - squared equals c squared but you don't
72:38 - really know it until you've gone through
72:40 - all these different lessons where you
72:42 - get to move shapes around i actually
72:43 - found it quite difficult
72:45 - um but it really helped me sort of think
72:47 - about fractals and infinity in a
72:49 - wonderful way let's go to the next
72:51 - problem
72:52 - um so which is still so this uh this
72:56 - this particular element of the course is
72:59 - talking about
73:00 - uh infinite areas and how to do sort of
73:03 - infinite tiling and then how do you
73:05 - consider the total area of what you've
73:07 - tiled um so i'm gonna just step through
73:09 - this so what oh i did this one already
73:11 - too i'm i'm further ahead i did this one
73:15 - oh yeah i remember doing these
73:16 - uh here we go oh no
73:20 - what fraction of the largest circle
73:23 - is shaded orange okay let me put up
73:26 - another poll
73:30 - um nobody's hating this stream so far ah
73:33 - a couple of you
73:35 - um i'm gonna put up another poll so um
73:38 - these are going to be how do i add a new
73:40 - poll
73:41 - uh
73:42 - can i kind of end this poll end poll
73:45 - okay now it should let me do a new poll
73:49 - come on youtube
73:51 - refresh the page
73:53 - okay
73:54 - uh i'm gonna do a poll
73:56 - yeah there we go so infinite areas it'll
74:00 - let everybody sort of think about this
74:02 - problem
74:03 - and i'm going to call them from top to
74:05 - bottom actually you know what i just put
74:06 - the answer in
74:08 - one half
74:10 - two thirds
74:12 - three quarters this is a fun thing to do
74:15 - and four fifths so i'm going to ask
74:17 - everybody in the chat
74:19 - and i'm going to start to think about it
74:21 - now
74:22 - as i
74:25 - uh go through this now i don't know
74:26 - where i see the result there we go now i
74:28 - see the results of the poll okay so all
74:30 - the circles in the pattern have the same
74:32 - center each radius is half the length of
74:35 - the previous circle
74:37 - i wonder if having a little thing that i
74:39 - can diagram will help
74:43 - um
74:44 - i really need to eat
74:47 - to be able to think this through
74:50 - right now three quarters is winning out
74:52 - it looks like
74:54 - so a lot of people voted for four-fifths
74:56 - though let's see who's right all the all
74:58 - circles in the pattern have the same
75:00 - center
75:01 - each radius is half the length
75:04 - so what basically if i come over here
75:09 - um
75:10 - what fraction of the largest circle
75:13 - is shaded orange so in other words
75:17 - uh oops
75:21 - right if this is
75:23 - a circle of radius r
75:26 - the area
75:28 - is pi r squared
75:30 - so then if i were to take that radius
75:33 - and divide it by 2
75:35 - half the area of this interior one
75:38 - is now
75:40 - pi r divided by two squared which is pi
75:43 - r squared divided by four
75:47 - so this area
75:50 - is three fourths
75:52 - right that area is three-fourths of the
75:56 - whole thing so it can't be three-fourths
75:59 - because we're going to get more stuff as
76:01 - we continue to go
76:04 - like we're adding up all the orange
76:09 - which fraction of the largest circle so
76:10 - it's got to be four-fifths
76:13 - i think it has to be four-fifths which
76:15 - interestingly enough now is gaining its
76:17 - momentum in the poll
76:19 - but like i uh you know if i look back at
76:22 - all the explanations
76:23 - there's a very precise way to
76:26 - provably know that it's four fifths but
76:27 - i'm just going to use my intuition
76:29 - to say four fifths
76:32 - and i got it right yes
76:36 - um wow this is like one of the most fun
76:38 - times we've ever had doing one of these
76:39 - um so and um we can see now that four
76:43 - fifths has in the poll taken over
76:45 - and is uh is now winning uh way up now
76:49 - um so that there's a nice little trick
76:51 - there like it does makes you do sort of
76:53 - see how you can get tricked in thinking
76:56 - that it would be three-fourths based on
76:57 - how i worked out that math but
76:58 - four-fifths is the answer and one of the
77:00 - things that i really like about
77:02 - brilliant as well is that if you go
77:05 - to um the explanations you will often
77:08 - you will see typically like a really
77:10 - excellent uh summary of how it is um
77:13 - that the you that have come to the
77:15 - correct answer
77:16 - so um i want to encourage everybody
77:18 - there's um to sign up for free you can
77:20 - sign up for free right now when i take a
77:22 - break it would uh
77:24 - um you know it helps out the coding
77:25 - train brilliant.org coding train um
77:28 - again if you want to unlock all of their
77:30 - premium content and courses um then you
77:33 - uh you would receive a uh the first 200
77:35 - people do so will receive a 20 discount
77:37 - off of that i will also note up here you
77:39 - can't see it i'm gonna remove the banner
77:41 - the last thing i would like to say to
77:42 - you is that it's a really wonderful gift
77:46 - so maybe you know somebody who loves
77:48 - math and puzzles and science and
77:49 - learning and you know you're not as
77:51 - interested in doing it yourself or you
77:52 - already have it um gifting premium is a
77:55 - wonderful thing you can do and it'll
77:56 - work to do that as well through
77:59 - whatever this url is brilliant.org
78:02 - coding train
78:03 - okay
78:04 - um oh
78:06 - did the stream crash
78:09 - i wonder how much was hopefully not too
78:11 - much was lost that's a you know perfect
78:13 - timing i mean uh that's me being
78:15 - sarcastic there if you weren't sure um
78:17 - so i'm gonna take a break um perfect
78:19 - thing to do is sign up during the break
78:21 - and i will be back in um hopefully less
78:23 - than five minutes because i don't have a
78:25 - tremendous amount of time left and what
78:27 - do you think i should code
78:30 - whatever if you have some ideas of
78:31 - something i should look at i mean i was
78:32 - kind of there's two ideas that i'm
78:33 - working with um there was a recent
78:37 - um was it
78:38 - oh there's there's a bunch of
78:40 - suggestions that came in through the
78:41 - discord i'm already forgetting what they
78:42 - are
78:43 - there was the um
78:46 - um number file video maybe and then
78:48 - there was something else
78:50 - and then i really do want to continue
78:52 - the steering behaviors because i need to
78:55 - figure them all out and then make videos
78:57 - about them so that actually is kind of
78:58 - probably what i should do
79:00 - um
79:01 - although ultimately this fall
79:04 - um i'm going to be focusing on machine
79:06 - learning and text programming because
79:08 - those are the topics of my courses okay
79:10 - taking my break sign up for brilliant
79:13 - and see you in just a few minutes
79:24 - [Music]
79:42 - so
79:47 - [Music]
80:06 - so
80:26 - do
80:40 - [Music]
80:45 - [Music]
80:50 - [Music]
81:01 - [Music]
81:27 - [Music]
81:48 - [Music]
81:54 - do
82:05 - [Music]
82:20 - do
82:23 - [Music]
82:25 - hi everybody the stream seems to be
82:27 - crashing
82:28 - so
82:29 - [Music]
82:33 - i think i'm back
82:35 - um
82:37 - so apologies for that
82:39 - hopefully
82:40 - it will
82:41 - continue to work um
82:43 - just another 30 seconds here
82:52 - [Music]
82:56 - do
83:01 - [Music]
83:11 - back
83:14 - definitely having some technical issues
83:16 - with the internet today
83:20 - um
83:24 - all right the radish pie
83:28 - um
83:34 - so the so the um
83:36 - there's been some good suggestions of
83:38 - things that answer today's coding train
83:40 - um
83:41 - it will be so
83:42 - idea number one is um i do want to look
83:45 - at i want to do all of these steering
83:47 - behaviors
83:48 - so if you love steering behaviors
83:50 - so containment is the next one on my on
83:52 - my list
83:53 - to figure out so what i would be doing
83:55 - during the live stream is kind of
83:56 - working through it to see if i can get
83:58 - the basic algorithm going and then i
84:01 - would later record a separate video all
84:03 - about it so that's option number one
84:06 - uh a really wonderful um suggestion that
84:08 - came in from david although i'm a oof
84:11 - reconnection successful i don't know you
84:13 - know i could
84:16 - just reboot the router
84:19 - which might be a thing that i need to do
84:22 - but given that i have so little time
84:23 - left so this would be a great one to do
84:26 - [Music]
84:27 - um but i
84:29 - um
84:30 - i look uh you know you could also
84:33 - support numberphile
84:34 - uh with brilliant but um and by the way
84:37 - if you're not already uh following
84:40 - um
84:41 - on twitter
84:43 - matt henderson
84:44 - you definitely should be because these
84:46 - visualizations are all just what i mean
84:49 - like in another life i would love to be
84:51 - able to make stuff as brilliant as this
84:53 - um
84:55 - whoa what is going on here
84:57 - anyway so um
84:59 - so doing my own version of this
85:02 - particular
85:04 - um
85:06 - um this particular visualization there's
85:08 - a really great one with chaotic bouncing
85:10 - balls as well that's an option of course
85:13 - i'm
85:14 - taking so much time talking about the
85:15 - options that i won't necessarily have
85:16 - time for any of them and then the the
85:18 - other one is uh the website
85:21 - 538
85:22 - a radish i don't know if
85:24 - i can find this
85:26 - very easily can you bake the radish pie
85:29 - up
85:32 - the boiler went on
85:33 - i'm surprised it didn't happen sooner
85:35 - than later makes a loud noise i don't
85:38 - know how
85:40 - how bothersome that is for you
85:42 - um would be to
85:44 - the next got louder um would be to look
85:47 - through this
85:48 - riddler problem can you bake the radish
85:51 - pie
85:52 - related to math logic and probability i
85:55 - assume i don't know if there's a good
85:56 - visual p5 element to this
85:59 - um
86:00 - so maybe this doesn't really fit so i'm
86:02 - kind of leaning towards just going
86:05 - the safe
86:06 - option which would be to work on
86:08 - containment
86:11 - and yqn is saying number file is my fav
86:14 - channel for coding inspiration which is
86:15 - absolutely true but why not uh
86:19 - 30 minute start of so steering
86:25 - containment
86:27 - the other option i said was
86:32 - venus rose
86:34 - if that's the right name for it and then
86:36 - the third option
86:38 - is this riddler and then do not follow
86:40 - what people actually voted on
86:42 - also
86:44 - it doesn't feel seem like the internet
86:45 - is working
86:46 - so this is all kind of a bit of a a bit
86:49 - of a mess
86:50 - i i'm like i've got a little bit of a
86:52 - headache i'm feeling a little late
86:53 - because i really did not eat anything
86:54 - this morning
86:56 - my wife likes to text me when i'm like
86:58 - busy teaching like remember to eat today
87:00 - because i really do just completely
87:03 - forget to go eat lunch
87:05 - and busy and then at some point later in
87:07 - the afternoon i'm like
87:09 - dying and this is sort of what's
87:10 - happening me now but i'm going to eat
87:12 - i have time to eat lunch at 12 30 before
87:14 - the rest of my afternoon meetings
87:18 - um but let's come back here
87:20 - and see
87:21 - uh steering looks like it is winning
87:23 - this right now which i'm pleased to see
87:25 - i might have put my thumb on the scale a
87:27 - little bit too much
87:28 - i'll give it another minute or two here
87:31 - um i'm looking at the various chats
87:35 - i mean containment would be the thing
87:37 - that would be best for me to like make
87:40 - forward progress on my life's work of
87:44 - redoing of implementing these steering
87:46 - behaviors so but i can see it's and it
87:50 - is um you know it's a little bit unfair
87:52 - because if you add up venus road and
87:54 - rose and riddler there's more votes than
87:57 - just containment although containment
87:59 - just got a huge burst all of a sudden so
88:02 - i'm gonna take this as uh gospel
88:04 - and let's go and start to actually work
88:07 - on the containment steering behavior so
88:10 - uh simon who is um
88:14 - oh and i need to go back to the oh i'm
88:15 - not in the live chat
88:18 - uh channel anymore
88:21 - um now i'm back
88:25 - look at the classic not the express that
88:28 - must have been related to the um
88:30 - radish pie
88:32 - i don't know
88:34 - but i think i'm going with containment
88:36 - based on the votes of the poll
88:38 - um
88:39 - and for have starting point for me i
88:41 - would love to hear it
88:43 - um
88:45 - how do you all feel i think what i'm
88:47 - gonna
88:48 - look
88:48 - i've got 25 minutes it's probably gonna
88:51 - take
88:52 - two or three minutes
88:54 - to reboot the router
88:57 - but the stream keeps crashing and the
88:59 - only thing i can think to do other than
89:00 - restart the computer
89:02 - would be to reboot the router
89:05 - restarting the computer feels much more
89:07 - um of an extreme thing because i've got
89:10 - everything set up the way that i've
89:13 - got things going i'm by the way i've
89:15 - purchased a new streaming computer
89:17 - because i do currently this one does not
89:19 - have
89:22 - the camera just went off are you serious
89:25 - yeah okay i'm gonna reboot the router
89:28 - camera's off i'll work on that so the
89:30 - stream is 100 going to go down
89:34 - but it will come back up
89:36 - say something hello
89:41 - i'm waiting to see a message from
89:43 - somebody confirming
89:46 - that you can hear and see me oh wow
89:48 - there's no everybody left
89:51 - wow
89:52 - rebooting the router is definitely did
89:55 - that end the stream
89:57 - hopefully not
90:00 - let me see if i can pull it up
90:09 - see me oh wow there's no everybody left
90:12 - oh no i'm back
90:14 - rebooting a router is def
90:17 - okay
90:19 - [Music]
90:24 - oh maybe people are coming back now
90:26 - people are coming back
90:28 - watch that number go up okay
90:31 - uh there we go
90:32 - all right maybe people are coming back
90:34 - maybe they actually didn't leave but
90:35 - everything got disconnected
90:37 - um all right so here i am back oh eric
90:40 - is in the chat i think i just saw eric
90:42 - why is this not showing up and i totally
90:46 - forgot
90:47 - um hi eric uh thank you for joining
90:50 - today um actually let me just if you'll
90:52 - indulge me for a second i want to just
90:54 - make a really quick plug
90:56 - of eric's gofundme
90:59 - if somebody could
91:01 - paste it into the chat one of the mods
91:04 - could paste the link i think you'll find
91:05 - it was recently on my twitter so eric is
91:08 - a dedicated viewer of the coding train i
91:10 - mean i don't wanna
91:11 - you're not so dedicated you don't have
91:13 - to be dedicated but i feel like you're
91:14 - dedicated you have corresponded with for
91:17 - uh many years
91:19 - i had a bicycle accident i think i met
91:21 - eric first when i had a bicycle accident
91:22 - and i broke my elbow and my wrist and i
91:26 - couldn't use either of my arms to type
91:28 - and i experimented with
91:31 - trying to use voice control i didn't get
91:33 - so far it was just a big learning curve
91:35 - and by the time i had learned how to do
91:37 - some things i was gaining use back and
91:39 - also just took a break
91:40 - so but um eric is disabled and works
91:43 - with his computer entirely through voice
91:45 - control
91:46 - that's really amazing and needs a new
91:48 - computer so i hope the coding train
91:49 - community could support um eric in
91:52 - helping him get um a new computer so i
91:54 - don't know if that got posted yet into
91:57 - the chat i haven't seen it i will pull
91:59 - it up myself
92:01 - i'm just going to go to twitter.com
92:03 - shiffman which is where you can find the
92:04 - link and there you go so uh find this
92:07 - gofundme link and if you're able to
92:08 - support please
92:10 - do okay now containment we're not going
92:13 - to get super far with this
92:15 - but i'm excited to at least get it
92:17 - started
92:18 - um it will lead me to the next videos
92:20 - that are coming out that have already
92:21 - been recorded are
92:23 - path following so if you're following
92:26 - along with my steering behavior
92:27 - obsession
92:30 - i have let's just look at these
92:32 - examples implemented of
92:35 - seek and flee pursuant of aid which i
92:37 - messed up
92:39 - so i think i need to record i'm going to
92:41 - make a little note here
92:42 - pursue and evade correction
92:45 - so that's a video i need to make
92:50 - if you're wondering i'm
92:52 - i'm look writing this stuff down here uh
92:55 - wander is done arrival is done obstacle
92:58 - avoidance is one
93:00 - um obstacles containment
93:03 - uh wall following
93:05 - [Music]
93:07 - so
93:08 - path following is done flow field
93:10 - following i have an example of but i
93:12 - don't know that i've ever explicitly
93:13 - made a video just about it other than
93:15 - some really old ones
93:16 - um so then a crowd path following leader
93:20 - following unlike so i'm not going to
93:21 - worry about these group ones but because
93:23 - i want to get through all of the simple
93:24 - behaviors first
93:26 - so it looks like i need to the videos
93:28 - that i need to make are on
93:30 - pursue and evade the correction
93:33 - obstacle avoidance containment and wall
93:36 - following and i believe
93:38 - that i have heard
93:40 - from my
93:41 - and by the way it hasn't crashed again
93:42 - right from my
93:44 - uh another dedicated viewer of the
93:46 - coding train simon
93:47 - that um
93:49 - that containment would be a good one for
93:51 - me to start with so let's go to it
93:54 - uh i um i didn't do any random numbers
93:57 - today and how come i lost the page the
93:59 - containment on it oh here it is
94:02 - so this is a little confusing to me
94:03 - because it is lumping it together in the
94:05 - paper
94:07 - with wall following
94:09 - but um
94:11 - i'm just creating a new page um
94:16 - but um i think i'm gonna be able to
94:18 - parse this okay variations on path
94:19 - following okay it's a variation on path
94:21 - falling that's good
94:24 - um obstacle avoidance is
94:28 - uh
94:29 - definitely the hardest of the three says
94:30 - simon
94:31 - wall following means to approach a wall
94:34 - or other surface or path what if by the
94:36 - way
94:38 - what if instead of making this full
94:40 - screen
94:42 - i kind of put this up in the corner here
94:45 - so if i start trying to diagram stuff
94:47 - while i'm reading this
94:49 - you'll be able to see both okay let's
94:51 - try this see how this goes
94:53 - wall following means to approach a wall
94:55 - or other surface or path than to
94:57 - maintain a certain offset from it okay
95:02 - containment refers to the motion which
95:03 - is restricted to remain within a certain
95:06 - region
95:07 - okay so
95:09 - just thinking about this
95:12 - let's start with like the simplest
95:13 - possible case
95:16 - i have a 2d canvas
95:19 - i have a vehicle and its job is to never
95:22 - is to stay within the canvas so that's
95:24 - containment
95:26 - okay and i've made my own version of
95:28 - this in a weird sort of way i think in
95:30 - the nature of code book i talk about
95:32 - having a steering behavior or a force
95:34 - that just emanates from the edges but
95:35 - that's probably my implementation is
95:37 - probably overly simplistic or different
95:39 - than here
95:40 - fish swimming in aquarium hockey players
95:42 - skating within an ice rink to implement
95:44 - first predict a character's future
95:46 - location great so that's something i can
95:48 - always do right look at the current
95:50 - velocity
95:52 - and predict its future location
95:55 - okay this is actually working quite well
95:57 - having the diagram like this i kind of
95:59 - like this
96:02 - if it is inside the allowed region no
96:04 - corrective steering is necessary
96:06 - otherwise we steer toward the allowed
96:08 - region this can be accomplished by using
96:10 - seek with an inside point
96:13 - oh
96:14 - wow this is starting to sound easier
96:16 - than i thought it might be
96:18 - so
96:19 - um so let's let's i don't even need to
96:21 - read any further obviously there's more
96:22 - to do but let's create a basic example
96:26 - so i think what i want to do and
96:28 - unfortunately the problem with my little
96:30 - method here is i have very little screen
96:32 - space
96:35 - for coding but let's
96:37 - open up
96:38 - um
96:40 - steering
96:45 - and these are my corrections let's look
96:47 - at
96:53 - i'm trying to remember this is pursue
96:55 - wander um
96:57 - let's look at i think this um
96:59 - let's look at
97:06 - i'm trying to remember where i first do
97:07 - a future location well wander does that
97:09 - let's just go to wander i'm so silly
97:12 - um
97:16 - so i'm gonna go to wander
97:18 - the very basic
97:20 - wonder okay so i'm gonna duplicate it
97:25 - and i'm gonna call this containment
97:29 - okay
97:30 - i'm gonna give myself
97:31 - much more space for the code
97:34 - i'm going to move this back over here
97:37 - and so the diagram stuff is going to be
97:39 - pretty small
97:41 - let's go to the sketch
97:44 - let's make this just like
97:46 - 300 by 200.
97:50 - there we go okay and i one thing i want
97:52 - to do right now as interesting as it is
97:55 - is let me take out this history thing
98:01 - because
98:01 - [Music]
98:03 - it is not
98:07 - as
98:10 - relevant here
98:13 - okay
98:16 - and whoops
98:21 - so now let's also take out this so i'm
98:23 - just trying to simplify wander for a
98:25 - moment
98:26 - and i need to write a new function
98:28 - called containment
98:30 - so it probably would make sense
98:32 - for this function
98:34 - to be something like
98:37 - um
98:37 - [Music]
98:38 - you know to receive like a region that
98:40 - you're being contained in but i'm going
98:42 - to make a again a lot of over simplistic
98:46 - i'm going to simplify this possible
98:48 - scenario space
98:50 - by just considering that the actual
98:52 - canvas is the region
98:54 - so the first thing that i need to do
98:56 - is get a prediction
99:00 - which i can do by and i'm kind of doing
99:02 - what i've done in other so this would
99:04 - make sense like predicting the future
99:05 - location probably would make sense to
99:07 - break that out into a separate function
99:09 - entirely because it's a repetitive task
99:11 - that's happening in multiple steering
99:12 - behaviors but for the sake of argument
99:14 - right now i'm going to keep it right
99:16 - here
99:17 - i'm going to say
99:20 - let's look at
99:24 - um
99:26 - it's future location like uh let's say
99:29 - like
99:29 - a 30 frames from now
99:32 - and
99:33 - let's add that
99:35 - to this position the position and uh
99:38 - draw a red dot
99:42 - and sometimes i like just using stroke
99:46 - which is sort of silly but uh and then
99:48 - say uh point
99:50 - at this step uh prediction
99:53 - x and this prediction y
99:57 - okay
99:58 - so all i'm doing so far is that i've got
100:01 - the vehicle
100:02 - i look at its velocity i make a longer
100:05 - version of the velocity and then i add
100:09 - that to the position right that's the
100:10 - position and i get this future location
100:13 - and i draw it red so hopefully if i run
100:16 - this
100:18 - cannot read property of undefined where
100:20 - is this push happening
100:26 - ah
100:27 - okay let's take this out
100:30 - and
100:32 - also instead of wander
100:35 - let's call containment
100:42 - uh cannot read property undefined of x
100:45 - where
100:49 - tell me where
100:51 - vehicle js line 35
101:00 - i spelled it wrong good job
101:02 - no
101:04 - prediction equals this.velocity.copy
101:07 - add this position
101:10 - oh it's i put this prediction ah
101:17 - this is taking me much too long to find
101:18 - this clip
101:23 - oh i can't even find it there we go
101:29 - um okay let's see what we got now
101:31 - there we go
101:32 - okay great
101:34 - so we see
101:35 - i'm predicting the future location
101:38 - and let's predict it 100 frames ahead
101:42 - which is just and now basically what's
101:45 - the next step in containment
101:53 - if it is inside the allowed region no
101:56 - corrective steering is necessary so i
101:58 - need to know is it inside the um i still
102:02 - keep looking at my watch 10 minutes left
102:04 - and i'm really really
102:06 - struggling for energy and brain power
102:08 - here
102:09 - any suggestions for what i have lent for
102:11 - lunch today a nice salad
102:12 - with some beans maybe
102:18 - so this is going to be to be continued
102:20 - but
102:22 - so
102:22 - one thing that i probably would want to
102:24 - build for myself
102:26 - is generic functions to determine if
102:30 - um some particular
102:32 - spot is inside uh some particular region
102:36 - and i believe that i've maybe done this
102:38 - with looking at like is a point inside a
102:41 - polygon maybe i only did it in
102:44 - convex or concave or whatever thank you
102:47 - marvel man
102:50 - but um
102:55 - i think so let's let's let's do this in
102:57 - a sort of
102:58 - let's build the tools to be sort of more
103:00 - generic
103:02 - but
103:03 - um keep it sort of simple
103:05 - so i'm gonna write a function
103:09 - just called
103:10 - contains
103:12 - and
103:13 - a vector
103:16 - so i need like a region
103:18 - so i i want a generic function and oh
103:21 - the camera went off again
103:23 - i think it's overheating
103:26 - this is what's going on because it's
103:28 - fully charged
103:30 - wow so
103:33 - uh
103:35 - youtube mem youtube members or anyone
103:40 - when i announce
103:43 - on friday morning that i'm going to be
103:44 - live streaming like a couple hours from
103:46 - now your response should be did you eat
103:48 - breakfast
103:54 - uh simon's telling me that the diagram
103:55 - really explains this well
103:57 - which i can see that it does ah yeah so
103:59 - like we can see this like look at this
104:01 - ah this is great thank you simon so we
104:03 - can sort of see what's going on here
104:04 - right i've got this one if the point is
104:06 - outside the region
104:07 - somehow project a point back in and
104:09 - that's the steering target do nothing
104:11 - here do nothing here here this is
104:13 - outside projected so i don't know
104:14 - exactly how to project this point looks
104:16 - like it's doing it as like a normal
104:18 - somehow to the sort of path of the wall
104:21 - um yeah i need to get a
104:24 - referral bro is telling me to get a fan
104:26 - on it that's definitely what i need to
104:28 - do
104:29 - it's quite warm i mean it won't be an
104:30 - issue once it's cooler weather
104:33 - um but i'm like there's no air
104:34 - conditioning in here and i'm in a garage
104:37 - it's kind of like half an outdoor space
104:38 - which i'm a little bit worried about
104:39 - having all this equipment in they may
104:41 - have suggestions for how to
104:43 - appropriately keep like do i need like
104:46 - dehumidifiers is that the thing that i
104:48 - should be getting for this um garage
104:50 - space
104:51 - um i know i'm
104:57 - uh okay so
104:59 - um
105:00 - let's uh let's write this function
105:03 - um but i'm going to
105:06 - comment this out and just say it is now
105:10 - contains
105:11 - so eventually i want to figure out how
105:13 - to define the region
105:15 - and
105:17 - figure out if the vector is within that
105:19 - region but i'm going to treat this in a
105:21 - very simple way by just saying as long
105:23 - as v dot x is less than width
105:28 - and i should actually just do return
105:30 - so i'm going to return
105:32 - v dot x is less than with
105:35 - and
105:36 - v dot x is greater than zero
105:40 - and
105:41 - v dot y
105:43 - is
105:45 - uh less than height
105:47 - and
105:48 - v dot y is greater than zero and i'm
105:50 - going to change this to
105:52 - i should probably do this no no that's
105:54 - fine this works
105:56 - because it's just the point
105:58 - okay
105:59 - so
106:00 - uh let's take a look oh it wow it
106:03 - when i auto formatted it put it all in
106:05 - one line
106:06 - um so now i should be able to say
106:09 - um
106:10 - here
106:12 - if
106:13 - contains prediction
106:18 - and let's do
106:19 - um
106:22 - i was going to change the color of the
106:23 - dot but as soon as the dot is out
108:27 - okay my audio should be back
108:29 - unfortunately now i'm using this mic
108:31 - which is maybe a good mic for podcasting
108:34 - if i'm talking really close up to it in
108:36 - a very very
108:37 - deep voiced kind of way
108:39 - but i know it's going to be really
108:40 - echo-y and the audio won't be as good
108:42 - but
108:44 - as i have approximately two minutes left
108:48 - so much technical fail today
108:50 - um so and and i'm i'm kind of losing
108:53 - steam so i'm not i didn't
108:56 - this wasn't my best uh
108:57 - stream but pretty good for not having
109:00 - stream for a while from being in a brand
109:02 - new location with new equipment uh
109:04 - obviously it would have made sense if i
109:06 - could have done several practice streams
109:08 - before i came and did today but
109:11 - welcome to today's practice stream
109:13 - sponsored by
109:15 - brilliant
109:17 - i'm gonna wrap things up
109:19 - uh the audio is better
109:24 - this is better audio that seems crazy to
109:26 - me but maybe it is um
109:29 - uh it it will suffer from me like
109:32 - walking over here
109:33 - because now i'm like moved away from it
109:35 - or if i turn and talk in this direction
109:37 - versus turn and tonic in this direction
109:38 - but
109:39 - um
109:41 - um anyway so i think i've got to wrap
109:42 - this up i have to just uh i was gonna
109:44 - say quit while i'm ahead but i'm way
109:46 - behind so quit before i fall further
109:49 - behind i'm gonna read an explanation
109:52 - um it's a reflection like do you see the
109:54 - blue segment is the left yeah so so the
109:57 - next step here that i would need to do
109:59 - um and i think i can make this bigger
110:03 - is that basically
110:05 - if um if what i see is that the future
110:08 - location is here
110:11 - what i want to do
110:12 - is create a
110:15 - reflection
110:17 - i'm just looking at this
110:20 - which would go i guess like this
110:23 - oh sorry you can't see that
110:25 - which would reflect back so whatever
110:27 - this distance is
110:29 - this is a distance d ah i look for the
110:32 - distance so i'm going to be doing some
110:33 - kind of normal point finding just like i
110:35 - did in path following great so the tools
110:37 - of pathfinding will apply so i did i
110:39 - forgot i did this in path following
110:42 - uh the last mic was better okay i'm
110:43 - hearing
110:45 - hi stig
110:47 - um you're having dinner i haven't even
110:49 - had uh i had like literally like i had
110:51 - like of some blueberries this morning
110:53 - it's all i had as i was getting my kids
110:55 - ready for school
110:57 - so like kids at school i don't have to
110:59 - worry about they're like waiting for me
111:01 - to do something but apparently i forgot
111:02 - to feed myself um
111:04 - i had coffee uh
111:07 - not enough not enough sustenance to
111:09 - stream for two hours so i'm gonna do so
111:12 - this is in the path following videos
111:13 - which will be coming out as soon as i
111:16 - can get to reviewing and making the
111:17 - additional content for them do exactly
111:19 - this
111:20 - they take a given point project it onto
111:23 - some
111:24 - line segment
111:26 - this is scalar projection is what i'm
111:28 - doing or vector projection
111:30 - then whatever that distance is continue
111:33 - that normal
111:35 - out
111:36 - that same distance and then this is the
111:39 - target to which i will seek
111:41 - so i now understand
111:45 - uh i now
111:46 - understand that what i need to do so at
111:50 - a minimum this live stream was very
111:51 - useful for me i don't know uh it's
111:53 - harder for you maybe if you're new to
111:55 - things here to process this because i
111:57 - haven't released the path following
111:59 - examples yet but simon's been saying
112:01 - this to me probably for like six months
112:03 - and i can see now that he's absolutely
112:04 - right
112:05 - this containment will follow very well
112:09 - from
112:10 - um
112:12 - will follow really nicely from the path
112:14 - following content so i'll be able to so
112:16 - i will be back so i'm really um
112:19 - with the exception of what i will be
112:21 - october 22nd for sure
112:23 - um
112:25 - i will be live streaming every friday at
112:28 - this time i'm one thing i'm really
112:30 - hoping to do is establish a regular
112:31 - schedule i might like to do a poll
112:34 - in um i might like to do a poll in the
112:36 - discord about what like time on friday
112:39 - is best for everybody because i do have
112:41 - the flexibility to stream like earlier
112:43 - in the morning or a little later in the
112:45 - afternoon that i'm eastern time new york
112:47 - i'm you know on the east coast of the
112:49 - united states um so that i don't know if
112:51 - the mods want to help me remember this i
112:53 - do want to put out these polls about the
112:55 - new website stuff so that's first so
112:57 - join the discord there's another plug
112:59 - please join the discord um if you want
113:02 - to help engage with some of the surveys
113:04 - that we'll be putting out
113:06 - but i'm kind of curious to think about
113:07 - what time on friday might be best for
113:10 - the kind of global international
113:11 - audience
113:12 - um that there is
113:14 - um
113:15 - all right um
113:19 - yeah so will william asks what reference
113:21 - material are you using so in case this
113:23 - is um
113:24 - new to you
113:25 - here's where you want to look um so
113:27 - first of all all of this is coming from
113:29 - this paper 1991 paper steering behaviors
113:31 - for autonomous characters it's something
113:33 - that i'm working on working through i
113:35 - mean i've been working through this
113:36 - stuff since
113:37 - 2008
113:38 - or probably even before that um a big
113:41 - source of inspiration for this also is
113:44 - um casey reese's work uh artworks and
113:46 - look at his process compendium which is
113:49 - a nice
113:50 - um
113:53 - um
113:54 - um this this particular set of videos
113:57 - about casey reese's work is highly
113:59 - relevant in braitenberg vehicles but um
114:02 - if you go to codingtrain youtube channel
114:06 - it should be here under nature of code
114:08 - two
114:09 - if i start to scroll through these
114:12 - once i get to oh well let me just go to
114:14 - here
114:16 - once i get to
114:18 - chapter
114:20 - five
114:23 - uh chapter five are all of is what i'm
114:25 - working on now the camera went off again
114:28 - this is so sad i'm just gonna i'm not
114:30 - even gonna try i'm gonna let it cool
114:31 - down for a minute so sorry
114:34 - um
114:36 - so
114:37 - um
114:40 - the the this the five point x series is
114:43 - me attempting to make a video about
114:45 - every one of these steering behaviors um
114:47 - and so uh you know if steering behaviors
114:49 - is new to you
114:50 - start with 5.1
114:53 - but if a lot of this stuff about coding
114:55 - with vectors and motion is new to you
114:57 - then honestly i would start with
114:59 - 1.1 or even some of these other intro
115:02 - videos they don't necessarily um
115:05 - um it's not his exact sequence but 1.1
115:08 - is where i would start um yeah so
115:11 - sorry for all the technical difficulties
115:13 - here the camera's shutting off the
115:14 - internet going in and out seems like
115:16 - rebooting the router really did fix that
115:18 - so maybe that's something i should just
115:19 - do every time before i stream
115:21 - uh the mic i have rechargeable batteries
115:24 - that i recharged for the lav mic all the
115:26 - way up to a hundred percent and i'm
115:28 - walking away from the mic down to turn
115:30 - the camera back on at least just say
115:31 - goodbye
115:33 - but
115:36 - i think i need new ones or something
115:38 - obviously didn't work
115:40 - so if you have
115:42 - thoughts or suggestions on
115:45 - ways that i can improve i'm really
115:46 - working on the setup here i'm curious
115:48 - what people thought of having this like
115:50 - ipad for diagrams versus
115:53 - um
115:54 - you know i'm just gonna um
115:56 - let's just do this really quick
115:58 - uh can i do this new uh well let me do
116:01 - it so i'm closing this out
116:02 - i'm gonna do this new movie recording
116:04 - because this is gonna be my rope
116:07 - oh no no no come on
116:08 - new movie recording oh yeah yeah i
116:10 - didn't have to close it i could just
116:11 - switched it
116:12 - to oh i bet you if i just plug in my oh
116:16 - wait a sec hold on
116:19 - can i just turn on the camera
116:21 - uh
116:23 - yeah ah there we go look at this okay so
116:26 - this is my setup a little bit you can
116:27 - see the outdoors there um this is like
116:30 - where i have a whiteboard
116:32 - and i would put another camera over
116:33 - there this is my new light
116:35 - oh you don't see any of this
116:37 - i'm not even showing you the screen
116:39 - that's so sad
116:41 - oh that was pathetic okay so uh here
116:44 - here i am
116:45 - um
116:46 - uh like here's me
116:49 - hi
116:50 - uh with my green screen uh and this is
116:52 - the space that's that mic and you can
116:54 - see uh gloria
116:56 - maybe gloria's maybe maybe uh my wife
116:59 - took gloria inside or she's sleeping
117:01 - somewhere in the grass where i can't see
117:02 - her um over here
117:04 - i should just reverse the camera
117:06 - i've never used like
117:08 - this uh over here you can see i have a
117:10 - white board
117:12 - and uh another tripod there which i was
117:14 - trying to put another camera on but i
117:15 - just need another kind of even put a
117:16 - little light over there but this is i
117:18 - knew this light is really awesome
117:20 - um
117:21 - i have two of these so i got a and i
117:23 - have this one i have some sound blankets
117:25 - and this is the camera there so you can
117:26 - see the setup that i'm kind of um
117:28 - working with now um this is a little
117:31 - like
117:32 - uh streaming pc i'm gonna give this to
117:34 - my son to be for his school and homework
117:36 - computer and get a new streaming
117:38 - computer
117:39 - um that can handle more inputs with a
117:41 - with a real capture card
117:43 - um
117:44 - so this hopefully gives you a little uh
117:46 - quick
117:47 - um behind the scenes and since my
117:49 - camera's not working um now you can see
117:52 - so
117:53 - uh and and david asked how many new
117:55 - studios have you had since december of
117:57 - 2019 so it's not my textbook i had
118:02 - i had uh do not disturb on so that my
118:06 - text messages wouldn't come through and
118:08 - one just came through
118:09 - so
118:10 - um
118:11 - anyway uh
118:13 - i'm wrapping up um it is so i started
118:17 - just recording videos in my little tiny
118:20 - office at nyu
118:21 - in the tisch building then i moved to a
118:24 - closet in the tisch building then i
118:26 - moved to brooklyn so i had a different
118:28 - closet in brooklyn which still exists
118:31 - that still exists i just haven't had
118:32 - time to go in there so i do have two
118:34 - studios right now but this is my
118:36 - my own space with my own equipment that
118:38 - i am putting all you know the
118:40 - sponsorship and the member stuff oh
118:42 - right now everything goes towards like
118:45 - building out this new studio and uh and
118:48 - also like the coding train team that's
118:49 - helping me with various things like
118:50 - video editing and social media and stuff
118:52 - like that so um thank you to brilliant
118:55 - and thank you to all of you who watch
118:56 - and support um i'm really hoping that
118:58 - this can become my own space that i can
119:00 - really have ownership over
119:03 - and kind of
119:04 - see where that leads
119:05 - so
119:06 - uh
119:08 - malu asks how old i am i am 48 years old
119:13 - uh my dream by the way
119:15 - i'd probably do this my 50th birthday i
119:17 - want to go on a like train ride maybe in
119:20 - like a scotland or like through alaska i
119:25 - don't know there's i went on this
119:26 - amazing train in norway once i want to
119:27 - go on a like trip
119:30 - so tell me all of your best like you
119:32 - know look i don't i don't that didn't be
119:34 - luxury but i just mean like an overnight
119:36 - where the train ride itself is the
119:37 - experience
119:38 - um i think they have some yeah i i think
119:41 - i saw one that looked interesting in
119:42 - scotland but maybe there's so let me
119:44 - know
119:45 - thank you william uh
119:49 - and so i um i want this to be the setup
119:51 - though where i can both record videos so
119:54 - i do extra streams for members which are
119:56 - my recording sessions but i don't have
119:57 - all the equipment yet to do that
119:59 - and i got to stop i got to say goodbye i
120:01 - love you all
120:02 - every single one of you watching right
120:04 - now i really appreciate you
120:06 - and um
120:08 - trans-siberian india says i should have
120:10 - never been to india it's a little
120:12 - traveling is a little complicated right
120:14 - now
120:15 - uh with the global pandemic i hope
120:17 - everybody's doing okay but um i hope to
120:19 - get back to it
120:21 - i'm exhausted i'm gonna go eat lunch i'm
120:23 - gonna say goodbye uh you're gonna hear
120:24 - this dot song and see the outro thing
120:27 - again if you wanna support me
120:29 - um
120:30 - uh uh um watch
120:33 - send me a nice um comment somewhere on
120:36 - youtube like a video is a thing people
120:38 - can do uh join sign up for brilliant
120:41 - that's probably the primary way right
120:42 - now that you should support uh and
120:45 - there's also the membership and all
120:46 - sorts of other things like that um i
120:48 - gotta stop talking i gotta find the this
120:50 - dot song i'm sorry i didn't read any
120:52 - random numbers by the way
120:54 - if you are a member in the chat and you
120:56 - received your whistle
120:58 - post about uh if you like it it's like
121:01 - laser etched oh hold on i can do this
121:03 - now i'm going to show you this whistle i
121:05 - swear
121:06 - i'm i swear i'm stopping
121:09 - hopefully no more embarrassing text
121:10 - messages will come in
121:12 - uh one more
121:14 - uh where's the movie recording
121:17 - i minimized it i want to show this to
121:19 - you all
121:21 - uh i need so
121:23 - um okay take a look at this
121:26 - this is your you can have this this is
121:28 - your very my very own
121:30 - laser etched coding train train whistle
121:35 - and it has on this side
121:40 - a um
121:42 - i don't know why i can't okay there we
121:43 - go where's the camera on this thing it
121:45 - has on this side i should get out a
121:47 - portrait
121:51 - it has and i'm sorry that this is
121:53 - inverted this is a random walk pattern
121:56 - that is using the random numbers from
121:58 - the random number book that i use this
122:00 - is the number and this is the position
122:01 - in the book that started this pattern um
122:03 - i'm giving these as gifts for uh members
122:06 - youtube members of the coding train
122:07 - starting with the conductor and above
122:09 - level but maybe eventually everybody
122:11 - will get them uh thank you for watching
122:13 - i will see you
122:14 - next time next friday same time right
122:17 - probably the same time next friday i
122:19 - will have eaten breakfast
122:21 - thank you so much
122:22 - uh
122:23 - uh
122:24 - yeah that's it that's all i got goodbye
122:27 - i don't have the music page open i'm

123:36 - this dot song never forget the this dot
123:39 - somebody composed that song for me
123:53 - i'm gonna say once again here we go
123:56 - sing it with me it's the forward
124:01 - coordinate song
124:03 - [Music]
124:06 - it's the forward to cartesian
124:09 - coordination
124:25 - autotune and the internet will fix that
124:27 - for me
124:32 - sing it with me it's the
124:35 - new cartesian
124:36 - coordinate
124:40 - [Music]
124:47 - [Music]
124:57 - unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what
125:00 - else is there
125:03 - yes kittens thank you very much kittens
125:05 - and rainbows and cupcakes notice that
125:08 - look what i get
125:09 - i'm really losing my mind
125:11 - okay let's do it
125:14 - [Music]
125:28 - the kittens the kittens
125:30 - kids kittens and kittens
125:35 - [Music]
125:39 - the kittens the kittens kittens and
125:41 - kittens and kittens the kittens
125:46 - [Music]
125:51 - the
125:55 - kittens kittens
125:57 - [Music]
126:16 - [Music]
126:27 - i feel just sort of like a nice
126:30 - feeling of relaxation
126:32 - everything's gonna be okay today
126:34 - dream is not broken it has not frozen
126:36 - this is a this is a wonderful thing
126:39 - okay we're gonna do it i'm really
126:41 - getting to something i need my sound
126:42 - effect
126:46 - [Music]
126:56 - what else is there unicorns and rainbows
127:01 - and cupcakes
127:03 - that was invalid syntax i forgot uh
127:05 - there was one other thing here that i
127:07 - think is important that i will use
127:10 - continuously over and over again
127:12 - all sorts of text generation analysis
127:15 - things
127:16 - that i will use continuously over and
127:18 - over again
127:20 - first thing i need to do is yes
127:27 - [Music]
127:49 - goodbye everybody i've already turned
127:51 - the camera off so i can't come back to
127:52 - say goodbye but i'm
127:54 - ending the stream now
127:57 - i could just find where that button is
127:59 - to

so so maybe you can hear me again set menu sensitivity i should be louder louder even still and then here we go this should be better now low battery are you kidding me i just charged these batteries oh my god oh my exit oh my goodness i don't know how to use these mics okay hold on i'm muting myself oh boy this song is ending which means i've got to come on soon oh boy this might be something of a disaster today i should warn everybody in advance i got a lot of new tech going here and i'm gonna play the next song i'm gonna switch the camera to me in about one minute um oh i need my headphone i'm walking around here looking for okay ah here i found a headphone ah i stepped on something oh that hurts very this is very professional professional setup okay okay now oh my goodness i think i think i might be ready to go here i'm switching to me hi well i might be brighter good morning oh is it the morning it's 10 37 a.m welcome this is the coding train with me your host daniel schiffman with the train whistle it doesn't work very well let's check to see if my whiteboard camera is working almost no chance of this yeah that's not that's not a positive sign i guess i will not be demonstrating that today uh welcome um i'm i'm having a bit of a slow start um as some of you might be aware um i am in a new studio i'm in a garage it's quite a large space i wonder how the echo is right now i've got some i've i've been buying a lot of new stuff i've got a new light which i would love to show you but look the camera that i'm gonna do some behind the scenes stuff at some point i've got a new light i've got another new light that i didn't set up yet i've got some sound blankets to help with the echo i've got sound foam that i need to put maybe on the ceiling that will also help um and uh hello to italy uh says alex uh in the chat uh bon giorno did i get that anywhere close the correct ciao okay maybe that's a little bit ah i think there's a dead cicada on the ground over here i'm kind of in a semioutdoor space which is sort of fun gloria pickle my lovely pup is over there sitting in the grass i can see her out of the corner of my eye i think this might be a total disaster of a stream but uh it is still sponsored so oh let me go over here and say uh thank you before i forget to the sponsor of today's coding train stream uh brilliant brilliant is like the place on the internet where i love to just soak up and learn lots of new stuff uh in many interactive lessons computer science physics there's this course called beautiful geometry which is amazing it's going to be lots of ideas of things to code in p5 you can sign up for free at brilliant.org codingtrain um and if you want to unlock all of their uh courses and features um if you go through that link you will get 20 off the first 200 people to do so we'll get 20 off from the coding train i've been buying a lot of new equipment it's expensive and so by signing up by going to that link you're kind of helping me out and kind of keeping the train running here uh all right let me go back to this view um so um one thing that's a little bit tricky right now is that i am on a new home internet connection uh back when i was in uh streaming from brooklyn new york i had a fiber connection which was fairly reliable and high speed i have paid for the most expensive internet that i could get but out here um there is no fiber uh there's a lot of there's not that's just like not as much uh internet so it's a little touch and go um but let's see how it goes today if i have to come up with a different solution i shall um you know i had really hoped to be up and running more quickly i don't know if this is really going to come into fruition but i'm putting this into the universe january 2022 this is really where the coding train we're going to add some cars we're gonna add new the schedule is gonna be more frequent um so i'm uh with moving setting up a new studio i am teaching at nyu my my day job three courses this semester i will talk about those because coding train runs parallel with my um university teaching i've got a lot of commitments going on in the next few months my children though they're at school right now at this present time they're at school and they don't come home from school till later in the afternoon so that's certainly opened up quite a bit of time for me but i will be on sabbatical this spring and we'll see maybe i've got some maybe i'll i should be doing something else on sabbatical it's kind of unclear but part of setting up this new studio and and moving to this new place with this garage hoping to really make this my everyday workspace um to do a lot more coding train stuff and maybe other creative coding and other projects i don't know maybe i could start streaming other kinds of tutorials i uh beard trimming tutorials coffee pour over tutorials i'm trying to think i actually don't know about those things it's really nothing that i'm an expert in so sorry uh but that's coming so it's a slow start awkward start but i am here um part of today oh chris sears how is this even possible right's over here in my chat it's not my chat but in the discord member chat i'm teaching seven courses this semester that that blows my mind i don't even understand how that is humanly possible you my friend or a hero um school not cool you don't have a watch yeah i don't i don't really need the watch uh see soarin moderator soarin thank you for being a coding trained moderator in the chat um so let's see let me just try this one more time what's the chance that this has uh um come alive no okay so i don't have a plan for today i was kind of thinking well let me look at what courses i'm teaching make a plan let me look at some of my older plans simon reminded me i'm going to come over to this here for a second and i probably shouldn't do this but i'm going to go here to github.com codingtrain is it raining i hope it doesn't start raining because then poor gloria is going to get quite wet uh coding train uh rainbow topics i think is the name of the repository um where i kind of so this is the thing it's so true oh so true sound is much better than the last time so that's probably just the lav mic uh this space prefers the lav mic over uh have this i have this mic which i really do like i would i would certainly recommend it i don't want to unplug it it shouldn't be plugged in can you see it no where's the camera um it's like a elgato wave not not yet a sponsor but someday maybe um so a simon really rightfully pointed this out to me that i have this habit of at the beginning of every semester making a new markdown file with kind and i duplicate the previous ones and go through a list of stuff that i want to work on and uh apparently i never actually do anything but make the list so let's just look at the summer 2020 i won't make a new list today that's i guess i you know what is it the definition of insanity is doing the same thing yeah you can see like i don't think i've done any of these things that are on the list i didn't move this summer and i've been really working hard to try to keep the nature of code video tutorials coming out so i hope you don't all feel like i'm not doing anything i am doing stuff i'm trying um but um yeah i can see i think like all of these still apply so absolutely no point in remaking this list the cabana is no longer a thing it might return but i i do have dreams of making videos in a sort of different style like those cabana videos um uh yeah so these are i haven't done any of these yeah so great so all this stuff um has not nothing has been oh discord bot stuff that yeah i haven't done any of this so i have an idea this is gonna be fun ready all right everybody you're gonna be amazed watch what i'm about to do for you i'm gonna click this edit button i'm gonna type i don't have access to this project hold on what's going on here ah so i forgot that i made this very silly i attempted to make a youtube short um i don't know if anyone actually watched my youtube short i got some complaints about like why are you making youtube short not not not for you my friend um some people liked it uh but i i made a separate um github account um so maybe what i need to do is go back to um my myself sign in i don't know this might be a total fail whoa okay oh all right i'll take it oh no authentication code and guess where my uh oh i could you know what maybe i could get a code sent to my backup phone number would that help no okay so one issue is everything is a fail today oh my goodness this doesn't work all right this is good i'm gonna get my authentication code and i'll be right back i mean i'm not going to be very far and you're going to hear me the entire time but i'm just going to put on this sound i'll leave this here i'm walking to the side i'm still in a physical space where i'm going over to my phone which is tethered to the computer using something called elgatocam which totally does not work apparently authenticator looking for github okay i gotta memorize this in my head but not tell you the numbers and the dial is going down oh my god it's almost gonna run out of time okay am i gonna get it in time verifying yes i did it now um coming back here now let me see let me see if i oh yeah that the auto focus causes the desk to dance yeah by the way most of this i just want to say that most of this live stream is me just trying to like figure out this new studio but hopefully as i do this today and get further along more interesting stuff will happen there is a very dead cicada on the ground here i am entirely barefoot i hope you can see that uh i've got some nice rugs here and i'm really afraid of stepping on it i feel like i should do like having like a small little burial for it and say uh cicada say i i mean okay let's see there's got to be something here that's appropriate uh let me see no i want to say something i want to talk about the cicada over here that is lying on the floor cicada i don't know that i ever met you when you were alive but i hear your sounds every night as i walk gloria in the darkness and looking up at the stars and i i hope that you this is really happening right now okay i'll be right back what was i doing i was gonna see if i get that camera to work ah yes the ipad stand hmm i do have a guy i have four cats two are up for adoption someone in the chat mark booth said get a cat you're gonna be sorry you made that comment in a second all right i'm coming right back all right here i am come on epoch cam there's no reason why it worked all morning and then i wonder if i have to like be in the thing so it's like activated maybe i should be a little more patient here i'm gonna do this like maybe i actually have to leave this here like open for a short bit okay hold on all right everybody i guess it's really not gonna work up and down and up and down they never load they never load loading the musical broadway's back open when will my time be i will somehow make it on the stage of coding all right um now i um i want to talk about cats the brooklyn cat cafe is a nonprofit cat cafe in new york city cat adoption center and social space all volunteer 501 c 3 organization i am currently my family is currently fostering uh where are they i'm looking for ruby and loki because anyone see ruby ruby ruby and loki here we go i'm gonna you you know especially you know you want to adopt these cute lovely kitties there's loki and there's ruby ruby is amazing oh my god the littlest tiniest creature um and so um they're sweet and relaxed pair of kittens who can't wait to look his most handsome and floofy brown taffy over mead will melt as soon as you pick him up for pets and scratches he purrs like so loud ruby is a sweet curious tiny jewel of a kitty look i love them very much but we already have two cats and four cats is a lot so i'm hoping that somebody will be very excited to adopt them um you can uh i have nothing to do with the adoption process i am my family is just fostering them uh contact the brooklyn cat cafe i don't know maybe you uh um and if you're interested that's not what you're here for so but you know someone did mention uh cats in the chat all right so we've established we've established that i am a very disorganized person who live streams for enormous amounts of time doing absolutely nothing and that some amount of people continue to watch i'm viewership might be going down but you know c'est la vie um bookmark your cats yeah so um i'm trying to set up a new studio my goal a couple things i've i've let's talk about news coding train news breaking news okay so it's not really breaking news because it's all stuff that's repeat but i'm it's telling you this will give you a sense of what's to come and it will help me sort of like think about what it is that's happening that i'm doing so big project probably won't launch until the end of this year early 2022 brand new coding train website um one thing actually i wonder if i can like quickly put up a poll uh and bet what language are you going to get today the language of babel rambling babble that's the language i'm coding in today maybe the poll is kind of unnecessary here uh what i wanted what i wanted to say and we can i'm not actually so first of all you should join the discord um where's that button which pastes a link because i will be having official polls and okay why is itunes is trying to install itself finish okay um great so you should join the discord because that right now i'm going to do an uh sort of like anecdotal poll i'm just going to take your temperature and talk through something that i'm really struggling with um and uh i will soon release this as a google form in the discord itself for everybody to vote on to get your feedback on so one of the things i'm trying to think about with the new website is language and oh you don't see the website this is the old website the current website it's not old it is actively present and new and wonderful but we're making some upgrades you can see here there are various headings like challenges and beginners and learning and more and et cetera et cetera et cetera so for example um what what is the what is the best kind of language to use for organizing all the content on the website is it very sort of literal dry this is what it is beginner how to code in peop you know beginner tutorials uh coding challenges uh machine learning lessons i don't know or would the website be more fun and approachable and would you be able to navigate and understand what's going on you know i want to have a very welcoming and inclusive and kind of playful quality to it if there were more train themed things like these are the tracks and these are the train cars and over here in the cafe car you can join the discord to chat so this is one of the things i'm struggling with i'm so i'm going to be putting out a survey for all sorts of kinds of naming ideas if you are a writer also you know you know i think i don't really have anyone at present i mean maybe that's not true but i'm also maybe looking for someone to help collaborate on this to sort of think about a style guide for all the language and the descriptions and that kind of thing so um i mean that maybe that's on me to really work on more but that's so that's news item number one new website it's active an active project i will be maybe sharing uh rough versions of it doing we you know already put out i had volunteers to do some preliminary user testing of some of the designs so your path to getting those sneak peeks and previews is the discord of course if you join as a member you also you might get some other sneak peeks and previews that i will be sharing as well so uh karaoke is in the uh chat hello nice to see you um oh yes and the discord link actually can be updated to discord dot gg coding train because we now have a vanity url because as we all know i am a very vain person i mean it's true i mean i could be making all these video tutorials without me in them and yet i choose to put me in them every single day of the week so what are you going to do it's who i am it's what i am um i heard a noise it's it's it's my dog it's okay i heard an animal and i got a little bit afraid i think there are some bears around here not probably wandering into the garage in the middle of the day but um yeah thank you soren for posting that now um um all right so that was that's my website item number one i had some other things in my head when i started this news oh yeah so i'm also trying to figure out the right balance between live streaming and um what you're watching right now and uh more polished sort of recorded video tutorials and um that follows certain sequences as well as new coding challenges because you know as many of you probably my like ability to produce content has severely slowed down i think in some some aspects the quality has greatly improved i'm always and i've been getting very positive feedback about extra diagram and animation elements and you know quicker editing that lets you watch the videos more quickly frankly and have different visuals that help you step through and understand the concepts um but i don't know to what extent um but i'm trying to figure out it it's a tricky balance now how uh you know i could have instead of live streaming today i could have just started recording some more coding challenges but i used to do the coding challenges in live streams and people really like that i don't know i don't know how to do any of this i'm lost and so uh i think if i make it to january that sounds very um ominous but as i plan to make it to january i will have multiple days in the week so maybe i can start to do all of these things um but um i think this would be a good time um since i have no plan um and i just thought of it too wrong track to talk about and show some uh community contributions so one of my favorite things and one of the things that i'm really hoping will make its way into the new website it's very loud for me um is hopefully it's not too loud for you um our ways of featuring what viewers of the coding train are making so that you can share with each other so you can share with me and that everybody can be inspired and and and welcomed into participating so let's take a look i honestly have not looked at this at all let's go to um this page and i want to look at some bezier curve community contributions i think some new ones have come in i certainly look i feel like i looked at some of these maybe i haven't looked it does anyone remember if i looked at any of these in a previous live stream uh speaking of which though what is a bezier curve so my new trick that i am about to try and see how this goes i do have i really prefer to use a physical whiteboard i like the ability to gesture to draw to move around to erase but it's um i don't have a second camera where i am right now i tried setting up my phones and connecting it and so it's not really working i need some more lights to try to light the whiteboard area but also there might be some value in me doing diagrams that can be captured and replayed and stored so what i have for you today uh is um i mean it's it's an ipad i have one of these uh oh it's like invisible pencils um and i think and i this is procreate which someone recommended to me i've no idea how to use it i don't know if anybody knows or you have your favorite drawing app but what i want to do is kind of look at and diagram what is a bezier curve this is like a very weird um this is a very weird um like pen thing that i'm on sketching inking drawing airbrushing textures abstract charcoals elements spray paints touchups luminance what do i want i just want drawing um but i just kind of want like a whiteboard marker is that like this ooh no no no oh that's nice though okay and now hold on how do i can i go to here and just make like a new thing do this all right and then procreate is the best okay so that's good uh i use this app procreate okay great so maybe um can somebody tell me what for just like a very basic pen i should use not a painting painting brush could work no like drawing is what i'm doing but what is just or am i inking maybe i'm inking oh yeah there we go gel pen studio pen marker marker is what but i guess i want something maybe a little smaller so let's try this gel pen oh yeah this is right i just wrote my name that was very exciting two fingers touch is for undo look at that that is cool uh and then this is like probably thickness it doesn't get very uh and so i kind of want it maybe something a little bit thicker gel pen studio pen marker let's try marker again and then i assume i can pick a color somewhere is that like this no whoa what does this do i have no idea okay bezier curve so let me just practice what this would be like if i'm doing um a little uh lesson okay uh bezier whoops i think i made it some weird color where's the color is it this oh yeah there we go uh like what if i just want that there we go okay uh bezier so i also need a much more stable stand i need a much more stable stand because um is moving around a lot as i draw so what i don't like about this is i'm looking down over here which probably doesn't bother you but as i'm drawing then i have to turn i'd much rather be doing this right but um anyway uh so a bezier curve is a particular kind of curve that involves interpolation and as i discussed in my video about bezier curves uh you know technically a um we have a quadratic a cubic and uh what was the what's the first one called i'm completely blanking on this um uh but you know this this is the bezier curve if it just has two two anchor points um it's just a line between those two points but a quadratic bezier curve involves a control point and that control point as you move it causes the curve to bend linear that's what i'm of course i was like it couldn't possibly be linear right that's so obvious um so now oh it's a lot of undo there if i were to add a second control point then that causes the curve to bend down here and up here et cetera so but so by the way this is me just practicing trying to explain stuff with diagrams so and this is uh cubic smiley face oh i could draw this could be like a cat with like some whiskers how's this going everybody so uh my uh video uh it where i uh use an actual whiteboard and show some code examples and talk through everything there is to be on betsy carson this is one of the more popular videos that i've recently released um at least initially videos have these very strange lives to them so um they get a sort of burst of viewership when i first released them and sometimes that burst of viewership kind of takes off in a pretty strong way bezier curve video being quite a good example of that but still um usually if even if it's doing really well in its sort of initial burst somewhere between like 50 and 100 000 views which is tremendous i'm very thrilled with that um other videos like the wander video i recently released which is i'll get to next which is like in the middle of a sequence of many videos they don't tend to take off with that kind of burst whatever youtube magic is happening um it's just not picked up as much but then strangely videos that i have will just a year later or two years later sometimes like take on this life of their own and so the example of what's happening right now is a star let me search for like this a star coding train video um this one is just like consistent this is from 2017 is consistently the most pop viewed video right now every week every day on my channel it might have come down i haven't actually looked in like maybe like three or four days but um this is also pretty interesting that the search for this video is actually this i don't think these are tied to well maybe i don't i don't believe these older videos are time coded um code the title coding challenge has something to do with that that's interesting yeah and i i often think that what i probably should do is have and i don't want to do this but like if i were trying to optimize towards the strongest viewership i would actually just have a channel that's only the coding challenges so that people could subscribe only to that and that youtube's understanding of my content would be like oh people like every video because what happens is i release a coding challenge it's like recommended more and more and then i do one that's like i think really important and part of a sequence but it doesn't get as much viewership so then the next coding challenge is like well people aren't as interested anymore so maybe it'll be a little bit less it's like this neverending cycle um i i'm trying not to be obsessed with this stuff you know it's it's really not the primary my primary sort of incentive or motivation but it's so hard not to get caught up in it and i understand that for other people um you know who are doing this youtube stuff much more fulltime it can be much more of a primary driver an incentive okay snake game yes coding challenge number three the snake game most viewed video of mine at least of all time um all right so uh bezier curve i wanted to look at community contributions so let's see i honestly don't remember if i looked at any of these but um so i want to just look at all of these that are here and encourage you to submit your own um let's look at synth wave animation by chris sears who i know is at least was previously in the chat so let's take a look at this and see what happens loading loading loading loading whoa whoa i have i think i saw this but i definitely didn't look at this on stream because wow this is wild so um now i'm trying to even like understand how this is based off of my sketch i mean i guess i see it here this is my visualization of the quadratic bezier and with the sort of random motion but it's now mapped into a 3d space i feel like i'm like looking at a scene from tron or something this is amazing uh really cool stuff oh and there's music i don't hear it so um you know i'm i would love to it's probably like the way i have all my audio routing going on it's probably why the music is not being heard so apologies for that but it's probably better for me not to play the music on stream anyway uh but this is quite amazing this to me is the in uh it's just like the epitome of why i love doing this because i don't think when i was making my bezier curve example i ever would have thought of this visual application but i think there's so much um you know a bezier wander this on its own is wonderful but now this is leading me to think of so many different ideas yeah it's a great like uh yeah why t brent can ask is that the information super highway no but i could imagine this being like a nice visual for um you know some opening credits of of um some type of game or or other type of content yeah okay um thank you um turn click the canvas during the tangent lines ah oh fascinating so i i can't resist how much i love looking at this with the tangent lines and the colors but this also has a really nice uh quality to it now the move one thing that could be really interesting to experiment with it just occurred to me um it looks like this is probably based off of the random motion that's in my example where i'm just showing like okay see you can move the control points around the curve changes i don't know this to be true we could look at the code obviously but um i wonder if there were some type of um you know set of rules for the motion so that you know what if it were sine waves or purl and noise those are the obvious ones to start with but so that there's a connection as i'm moving through this space i'm seeing these rippling motions as each curve passes over me sort of passing its motion on to the next um so great great job um uh a bell and a train whistle for um this wonderful community contribution uh closing this one out and going on to bezier curve road editor i remember david telling me about this one so let's take a look what do i do here shift click to add points to the path so this is using the fact that you can uh chain the bezier curves together so if i go back to um i want a really quick way just to make a new page i guess right now the only way i know how to do this like there must be like in this can i have like multiple pages i can do cut and paste ah like can i make a like how do i make a new okay i'm gonna have to learn how to use this app later right now i'm just gonna do this um so one of the things that's really awesome about bezier curves i mentioned right we have two anchor points and two control points but um a bezier vertex just involves these three points here right that makes the entire bezier vertex like this is the next point we're going to but these control points and i'm sorry i really miss drew this because the curve doesn't pass through the control points that's a kind of common misconception or at least it's a misconception that i make so um oh wait what did i just do did i just change the color to white again what just happened right i don't know what's going on i obviously do not know how to use this piece of software i can have layers in procreate okay so um what's the bezier cat i don't was that the thing that i drew i have no idea what's going on anyway so these are doing a terrible job here these are the elements of the next vertex which means if i wanted to add another vertex i only need three more elements which would cause it to curve like this and then i could put three more elements and when i say element i mean three more points so the vertex the bezier vertex is a collection of three vertices the and i guess this little um it's it's where i am going to like if it were just oh wait what just happened um that was just an extra right it's where i'm going to like if i didn't have a bezier vertex i would just be going to the next vertex but because i do i'm kind of like curving around i have no idea what this would actually do with those two control points so super exciting so this looks like uh what david has done here and i believe the idea if i'm correct is ah yes look at this using bezier curves to create a drop like a road essentially and this would be a perfect complement to what i eventually someday will hopefully actually make i built a version of this during a live stream a while ago with an idea to make it as a multipart set of video tutorials but i want to use ml5 the javascript machine learning library that i uh helped to maintain to train and ai in big quotes to drive along this path so dreams uh that's like a great project for the spring if i can get back to that wonderful work thank you for this david all right moving along uh everyone gets a bell and a train whistle now we're going to look at bezier curve lerp animations 2 to 10 points by narayana okay gotta love this so one of the aspects of something that i emphasized in my video tutorial is how the bezier curve is the math behind the bezier curve is all about linear interpolation so linear interpolation between just two points is that line um and um but once i add that control point i'm then interpolating the interpolation between the anchor to control and the control to anchor so you can sort of see this playing out here in this animation so for example i think it'll be more obvious if i go to two points right there's i love how this demonstrates the idea so well this is linear interpolation from one point to another let's add one control point so now this is linear interpolation see how that's what that one point is interpolating between these two and the other one is interpolating between the other two and then between those two we've got this nice curve and is this the thing that i can move these points around no but it doesn't matter this is so wonderful i'm so excited about this now if i go to four this is what we're typically seeing as the cubic bezier but okay this is very exciting this really this merits a nice drum roll here let's go to five oh my god oh my goodness oh i'm getting getting a little warm over here oh that's wild oh that is so amazing um i i uh six this is so cool all right i i think i might be getting a delivery do you hear that beeping of the truck backing up uh okay and and and simon in the chat is telling like quartic um there's quintic there's all these different terms let's go let's just jump all the way to 10 because i don't know how else to experience this amazing uh that is wild let's let's do 10 with random points um yeah i see a a delivery truck hopefully they're just gonna drop it off and don't need me um wow this is wild so i'm distracted by the delivery truck but not to mention this incredible uh variation off of the bezier video okay thank you for this it's incredible a huge round of applause can we do that also all right now moving along um i'm almost to 11 30 which is my halfway point so recently the rhythm of these live streams have been um me babbling for a bit showing some community contributions taking a break and coming back and coding something i have a couple ideas maybe i'll when i after i take a break i'll put a poll up um and yes i know there's a whole live poll system that was engineered by many wonderful generous contributors of coding training i can never seem to figure out how to use um which is totally my fault um and but now there's just this pull button in the youtube chat i can walk over here and set a poll all right i am going to go to curve art by larry campfire let's take a look at this one whoa okay i did not know that this was going to be me so wait i don't understand this is wild okay wait i have to understand how this is done so first of all what picture is that gloria i wish i need a dog cam so what picture is this i have no idea i mean obviously it's a picture of me but i don't remember it's like this is a picture that's released on the internet somewhere probably um so this looks like it is a uh what's happening here if i can understand this correctly and um i'm going to attempt to diagram my understanding of this so there is an image and it has an image as a grid of pixels so each pixel has some brightness value so imagine the image is gray scale and the brightness values are like five okay this is too thick i guess 110 i can do this right make it thinner you know 255 100 0 10 right you could imagine this grid of pixels um each with a grayscale value so i think maybe what's going on is then this is visualized right so normally you would take the grace if we're visualizing the data of an image i would take the grayscale value and i would render it as a block of pixels with that value at that spot that's what an image is it's really just a visualization of the data the color being tied to well typically like an rgb value perhaps with an alpha but in here just the grayscale example a single number a gray value but many other things can be mapped to color to represent the image and you know i think a very a wellknown um example of this is even in the sort of like physical world is danny rosen's work you can see here these like amazing physical uh sculptures that take uh you know like little blocks of wood and rotate them to reflect light in different ways to create that pixel view um you know i'm trying to i love this one the like um it's these uh little penguins fuzzy penguins that like spin around so if they're facing you from their back they're dark uh facing you uh from the front they're bright so i really encourage you to check out danny rosen's work um if you're not familiar um look at all these videos that have obviously and links that have a tremendous amount more information so what's happening here i think is something similar of course it's still software and screen based so you can imagine doing this with like string or something but i think what's happening here is like if it is um a bright pixel maybe just a line is drawn and then if it's a darker pixel that line is if i zoom in it's bent so it like um would this is hard i don't really have my it would kind of like do this does it and that makes it like thicker or something so i i'd have to like try to figure this out but there's some kind of mapping of the grayscale pixel value to the uh curvature of the bezier curve itself i was thinking is the line getting thicker no it's just more pixels are being filled in because the curve has more uh the length of the curve there's more uh it's longer there's more space for it to fill and that by definition creates this sort of darker look to it so that's really wild i don't know that just would not have occurred to me to do that so what would be cool let's just see i'm just really curious um i want to take a version of this let me log in as coding train if you will indulge me for a second i don't know if this font is too small but and again i just want to emphasize this is um i am taking a larry campfire's example and i just want to see what it looks like with video so i'm going to say i'm going to add video let's comment out the image comment out preload and i'm going to say i know maybe it will take too long to run but let's let's we'll find out oh these are quadratic beziers so i was trying to in my attempt to think about it as a cubic bezier let's say uh create video actually let's just leave this as is with both the image just um create video uh create capture video so let's make sure this works so now i should have both this image and you can see there we are by the way so this is what it really looks like in here it's just a green curtain with a lot of lights and a much nicer camera than the webcam but that's what i look like standing here i one thing that i'm very unsure about so i need a haircut i don't always i don't need to wear a hat in every video but it's you can see this is a mess right now i'm a mess but uh lighting wise i'm just like i don't know if i have the right temperature lighting temperature settings on the camera anybody wants to help me with that i'm game but um okay so i should be able to figure out a way so this is using scale times image so let's do this i'm going to say uh video equals create capture and i want to take off the auto refresh and stop it so i'm going to make the video size i wanted to make it something that i know uh oh so it's actually multiplying up so let's make it like 40 let's take it 40 by 30. and let's just do the scale scale is eight i think that'll work is that going to be too slow i'm going to take out the no loop and so image should then where is it getting the pixel color it should be video ah so one thing will be this is an issue so it worked just fine because it was only doing it once but um using the get function to get the pixel color can be incredibly slow if you're doing it over every single pixel as opposed to just working with the pixel array directly but let's see what happens what's the worst thing that's going to happen let me try running this let me just comment out image so it'll throw an error if that's being used somewhere else and see what happens oh okay image is not defined right so i think what i'm going to do is just hard code in for right now what i know the size to be obviously i could pick it up from the video and then i got an error probably because the video isn't ready image is not defined no there's still another place where i'm using image ah okay this might throw an error because the video might not be ready oh nope totally working you can see it's totally working just running incredibly slow so is the slowness um just the bezier drawing the bezier curves themselves or i have to stop or can i get around that slowness by getting rid of that get function so the way to get rid of that get function i think gloria might have gotten tangled hold on everybody pause to help my poor no no she's not tangled she's not tangled okay she's on like a leash oops i'm okay um so what i can do instead is i should be able to say uh r equals video dot pixels the index plus zero so this is something i've covered uh like probably you know a thousand times um but i since i have this whiteboard thing here i'll do it again so let's just say these are my pixels they have row column numbers 0 1 2 row numbers 0 1 2 but the actual pixel number is 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8. so if i need to get the index 4 for example i can actually just say what is its x value which is 1 plus what is its row or y value which is also 1 times the width which is 3. so in this case you can see that makes sense because 1 plus 3 is 4. 1 plus 3 is 4 4 plus 3 is 7. so i'm going to add that formula into this code here saying index equals x plus y times times video dot with now here's the catch so while this is true this diagram that i've done is absolutely true there's actually four values in the array in each one of these spots and i did that wrong because there's r wait what why is it sometimes just change to white what am i doing am i like triggering an eraser i am i switch the eraser i see um there's an r a g a b and an alpha so red green blue and alpha so what i actually have to do is take that index which is which pixel am i on and multiply it by four because i've got to advance for every four spots can you hear gloria barking by the way does that come in through the mic um i wonder if i can just i have not tried a stream ming i've worked in here but usually she'll she'll come or i'll go and check on her but um so this should give me the red green and blue values instead of using get by going directly into the array and then i could should just be able to replace them here with r this is a very fancy way i'm always so lazy and i just get the grayscale value by adding them up and dividing it by three the average of the rg and b but this looks like i guess this is probably using like luminosity or something it's using a larger percentage of the red value um wait what times r times yeah um 21 no no of the green value 21 of the red value 72 percent of the green value and seven percent of the b let's see if this uh improves anything i messed something up what did i do wrong i mean i thought i didn't have to do this do i need to call load pixels i think i do i think i have to call load pixels i know why i thought i didn't need to do that oh yeah look at that so see how much that improved the speed so now we're able to do this in real time oh i love this lovely look at this it's so cool now i think what i could do is make the scale let's see how could i do 80 by 60 or is that going to be much too slow let's give it a try um let's just do this to be a little bit more thoughtful about it um oh yeah okay let's just see if this works this might be too slow from a drawing standpoint yeah you can see now this is too slow from a drawing standpoint but it's actually kind of nicer with it and i think what i might like to do is even lower it and then just make the scale like 32 let's try that's probably too extreme let's try 16. let's try 24. and i guess i guess 40 by 30 was a little bit nicer um where is there a stroke weight somewhere begin shape no fill stroke weight i'm just curious to like bump up the stroke weight a little bit and let's hit stop and let's try looking at this in full screen mode i know i'm taking quite a bit of time here huh what happened there cool kind of slow but still pretty wild all right thank you simon i'm like looking for my watch all right uh it is now uh officially the midpoint of today's a stream i do have a pretty much i really do need to stop by like 12 30. um i i hope that this is um that you are enjoying today so far let's uh thank you uh so much to ah um to uh larry campfire for that let's go to ah quartic bezier curve exciting by codefish and i apologize that i'm gonna end up you know kind of looking at some of these more quickly but this is core tick right because it has three control points great work working that out wonderful job code fish uh you responded perfectly to the prompt in my video and i am so happy uh let us go now to animated and control point bezier curve by alex hunter and what do i do here i click oh wild so i can just keep adding points and then i can speed it up whoa oh that is wild oh amazing so this is very much like what we saw before but now i have the ability to i um reset um to just actually just make my own points like if i go in a circle what happens and then uh also play around with the speed so have it run very very slowly or very very quickly amazing job this is all great a lot of breath from that uh now we are going to moving on an infinite loop made with bezier curves i might regret this but i'm kind of excited just by the title of that here we go oh there's a fly hmm error not sure what happened you know this full screen thing sometimes does mess things up i've noticed recently ah there we go awesome oh so it's like the infinity symbol somehow made with bezier curves and i love this little dot look how it's like i'm going to do sound effects for this somehow that speed which is going is this an illusion it's actually always moving at the same speed or no i believe it's slowing down it's probably following the actual interpolation wow so let's take a look here oh i see i see oh it's using the vehicle oh amazing somehow this is using something from nature of code oh no the vehicle yeah it's got like a vehicle in it somehow which is a great segue because the i don't know that anyone has made a community contribution for this yet because the video was just released yesterday but if you haven't watched my most recent video release on the coding train it is part of the nature of code series um all the way down here we have i'm you know i'm on this quest as i mentioned in the video to implement every single um craig reynolds steering behaviors i'm curious what people if people like these kind of goofy thumbnails that sort of like show little uh uh this triangle character kind of acting out but this particular wander behavior um we can see here yes look at this it seems like there haven't been made any variations based on this lesson see that's a very awkward sentence i probably wrote that sentence at one point but this is what i need i need to re really work on rewriting the language for the website and is the community contribution a community contribution or is it like a passenger's ticket no that doesn't make sense i don't know that's what i'm trying to figure out but yes there are no community contributions yet yet uh yet but you could be the first one you could submit it today i will be looking at them this afternoon on my own and i could come back and show them in a future live stream if you want help figuring out how to do that i would definitely join the discord which i just posted a link in the chat but let's take a look just at the various examples one of the things that i wanted to show you that i made for this video which wasn't part of the actual um coding itself and why is this so did i zoom in on this or something yes there we go um let me see can i drag this over i try to try to do this in 3d so one thing i was really pleased about is and so what is what is going on here um basically um the wander algorithm involves a vehicle and it needs to decide which way should it steer and the way that it decides is it projects a point out in front of it uh creates a circle at that point's location then projects a point out onto uh the edge of that circle and then steers in that direction then this point moves randomly over time and so what the result there is instead of just like making a lot of random motions sure that point might be moving randomly over time but it's not going to cause the vehicle itself to make a drastic change in direction until maybe it gets all the way back down like over here over here so it's a very effective way uh no no this is not where i'm swiping ah this is where i'm swiping so this is like i was trying to do this in 3d uh i think i might need everybody just prepare yourself i'm going to say something it's going to be a little bit scary i'm going to try to stay standing here not go anywhere i might need quaternions um to really figure out how to get my vehicle pointing in the right direction but um anyway i was curious if somebody has a better take on how to do this in 3d and visualize it i would love a contribution in that uh um vane i'm trying to think if there's anything else here i think this is kind of maybe a useful one to just for me to show you um you know think about how so this is the actual algorithm uh wander algorithm playing out and one of the things that i did with this is that i just attached some sliders so we could sort of see like how does it look if that circle cup becomes closer um or if that circle is much bigger um as well as i don't know what this one is oh the dismount of displacement is like bigger so this is a much more like actively changing direction wander versus if i were to put all these sliders down i would assume that with everything low um it's going to kind of move in the same and it's when i say move in the same direction it's not actually resolving to moving straight it's continuing to turn the same way for a while and then turn another way so there's a lot of possibilities for this i hope that you get a chance to explore this particular video tutorial and submit your community contributions so they could show up here i would love that so much how's everybody doing how is this stream so far um on a scale uh how is this is this stream on a scale of one to five oh i can only get four i guess so four is um four would be you really this is the best stream i've ever seen and one would be like you know i've liked previous streams that i've watched quite a bit more i don't know why i'm asking this it's a very dangerous thing that i've done like selfindulgent thing that i've done so but i would like a lot of feedback because i'm trying to figure out like what am i really doing here again my i think the way that i think of the universe of coding train content individual project videos coding challenges tracks i'm calling them tracks which are more like courses beginner beginner lessons um and you can see those if you're if you are a beginner um these are the ones where that you can start with on the website as well as some other tracks that are more themed around machine learning or physics simulation i am working hard to try to um record these and release them with good production value and then also live streaming once a week which is me just interacting with the community answering questions showing community contributions and what i'm doing today and then always programming something kind of new which is what i'm going to do in the second half even though i have no idea what i'm going to do yet so that's kind of i i would love to hear about like i'm trying to really be more sort of thoughtful and organized about how all the stuff is going i did not eat a very big breakfast this morning i'm starting to feel feel the um it's starting to punish me here a little bit as i cannot form words all right so um before i take a break it is time for me to mention to you um sponsor brilliant so um if you like learning and if you like learning from really well done exciting and interesting resources that you can find on the internet um like the coding train hopefully you are really going to like brilliant and i think brilliant the reason why i'm so pleased to have brilliant as a sponsor is it is a really wonderful compliment to what i do so here's what i'm doing talking at you attempting to draw diagrams blah blah blah blah blah trying to write some code here and there but if you would prefer to be a little bit more selfpaced to have some quiet time on your own whether on your computer or through an app brilliant has both of those for lots of interactive lessons so a couple of the courses do they have daily challenges i should go to the brilliant website which i will do um they have daily challenges and they have a whole set of courses like if i just click on this page it's like everything that i love is all here geometry neural networks statistics logic computer science fundamentals and one of the things that i really love about it i'm going to go here to the um like the al the out one of the algorithm algorithm fundamentals course i believe this is um is that the lessons not only are oh let me read through this material and see what's there are actually allowing you to interact and so if you want to learn more about coding you can see like figuring out pseudo code and logic checking your answers stepping through these interactive lessons that's really a wonderful thing to do ah yes this is um this is the course that i'm really excited about here um and what you um like that so many of the courses involve these really fun visual dynamic puzzles um really to teach a particular concept like if you if you maybe you know the formula for the pythagorean theorem a squared plus b squared equals c squared but you don't really know it until you've gone through all these different lessons where you get to move shapes around i actually found it quite difficult um but it really helped me sort of think about fractals and infinity in a wonderful way let's go to the next problem um so which is still so this uh this this particular element of the course is talking about uh infinite areas and how to do sort of infinite tiling and then how do you consider the total area of what you've tiled um so i'm gonna just step through this so what oh i did this one already too i'm i'm further ahead i did this one oh yeah i remember doing these uh here we go oh no what fraction of the largest circle is shaded orange okay let me put up another poll um nobody's hating this stream so far ah a couple of you um i'm gonna put up another poll so um these are going to be how do i add a new poll uh can i kind of end this poll end poll okay now it should let me do a new poll come on youtube refresh the page okay uh i'm gonna do a poll yeah there we go so infinite areas it'll let everybody sort of think about this problem and i'm going to call them from top to bottom actually you know what i just put the answer in one half two thirds three quarters this is a fun thing to do and four fifths so i'm going to ask everybody in the chat and i'm going to start to think about it now as i uh go through this now i don't know where i see the result there we go now i see the results of the poll okay so all the circles in the pattern have the same center each radius is half the length of the previous circle i wonder if having a little thing that i can diagram will help um i really need to eat to be able to think this through right now three quarters is winning out it looks like so a lot of people voted for fourfifths though let's see who's right all the all circles in the pattern have the same center each radius is half the length so what basically if i come over here um what fraction of the largest circle is shaded orange so in other words uh oops right if this is a circle of radius r the area is pi r squared so then if i were to take that radius and divide it by 2 half the area of this interior one is now pi r divided by two squared which is pi r squared divided by four so this area is three fourths right that area is threefourths of the whole thing so it can't be threefourths because we're going to get more stuff as we continue to go like we're adding up all the orange which fraction of the largest circle so it's got to be fourfifths i think it has to be fourfifths which interestingly enough now is gaining its momentum in the poll but like i uh you know if i look back at all the explanations there's a very precise way to provably know that it's four fifths but i'm just going to use my intuition to say four fifths and i got it right yes um wow this is like one of the most fun times we've ever had doing one of these um so and um we can see now that four fifths has in the poll taken over and is uh is now winning uh way up now um so that there's a nice little trick there like it does makes you do sort of see how you can get tricked in thinking that it would be threefourths based on how i worked out that math but fourfifths is the answer and one of the things that i really like about brilliant as well is that if you go to um the explanations you will often you will see typically like a really excellent uh summary of how it is um that the you that have come to the correct answer so um i want to encourage everybody there's um to sign up for free you can sign up for free right now when i take a break it would uh um you know it helps out the coding train brilliant.org coding train um again if you want to unlock all of their premium content and courses um then you uh you would receive a uh the first 200 people do so will receive a 20 discount off of that i will also note up here you can't see it i'm gonna remove the banner the last thing i would like to say to you is that it's a really wonderful gift so maybe you know somebody who loves math and puzzles and science and learning and you know you're not as interested in doing it yourself or you already have it um gifting premium is a wonderful thing you can do and it'll work to do that as well through whatever this url is brilliant.org coding train okay um oh did the stream crash i wonder how much was hopefully not too much was lost that's a you know perfect timing i mean uh that's me being sarcastic there if you weren't sure um so i'm gonna take a break um perfect thing to do is sign up during the break and i will be back in um hopefully less than five minutes because i don't have a tremendous amount of time left and what do you think i should code whatever if you have some ideas of something i should look at i mean i was kind of there's two ideas that i'm working with um there was a recent um was it oh there's there's a bunch of suggestions that came in through the discord i'm already forgetting what they are there was the um um number file video maybe and then there was something else and then i really do want to continue the steering behaviors because i need to figure them all out and then make videos about them so that actually is kind of probably what i should do um although ultimately this fall um i'm going to be focusing on machine learning and text programming because those are the topics of my courses okay taking my break sign up for brilliant and see you in just a few minutes so so do do do hi everybody the stream seems to be crashing so i think i'm back um so apologies for that hopefully it will continue to work um just another 30 seconds here do back definitely having some technical issues with the internet today um all right the radish pie um so the so the um there's been some good suggestions of things that answer today's coding train um it will be so idea number one is um i do want to look at i want to do all of these steering behaviors so if you love steering behaviors so containment is the next one on my on my list to figure out so what i would be doing during the live stream is kind of working through it to see if i can get the basic algorithm going and then i would later record a separate video all about it so that's option number one uh a really wonderful um suggestion that came in from david although i'm a oof reconnection successful i don't know you know i could just reboot the router which might be a thing that i need to do but given that i have so little time left so this would be a great one to do um but i um i look uh you know you could also support numberphile uh with brilliant but um and by the way if you're not already uh following um on twitter matt henderson you definitely should be because these visualizations are all just what i mean like in another life i would love to be able to make stuff as brilliant as this um whoa what is going on here anyway so um so doing my own version of this particular um um this particular visualization there's a really great one with chaotic bouncing balls as well that's an option of course i'm taking so much time talking about the options that i won't necessarily have time for any of them and then the the other one is uh the website 538 a radish i don't know if i can find this very easily can you bake the radish pie up the boiler went on i'm surprised it didn't happen sooner than later makes a loud noise i don't know how how bothersome that is for you um would be to the next got louder um would be to look through this riddler problem can you bake the radish pie related to math logic and probability i assume i don't know if there's a good visual p5 element to this um so maybe this doesn't really fit so i'm kind of leaning towards just going the safe option which would be to work on containment and yqn is saying number file is my fav channel for coding inspiration which is absolutely true but why not uh 30 minute start of so steering containment the other option i said was venus rose if that's the right name for it and then the third option is this riddler and then do not follow what people actually voted on also it doesn't feel seem like the internet is working so this is all kind of a bit of a a bit of a mess i i'm like i've got a little bit of a headache i'm feeling a little late because i really did not eat anything this morning my wife likes to text me when i'm like busy teaching like remember to eat today because i really do just completely forget to go eat lunch and busy and then at some point later in the afternoon i'm like dying and this is sort of what's happening me now but i'm going to eat i have time to eat lunch at 12 30 before the rest of my afternoon meetings um but let's come back here and see uh steering looks like it is winning this right now which i'm pleased to see i might have put my thumb on the scale a little bit too much i'll give it another minute or two here um i'm looking at the various chats i mean containment would be the thing that would be best for me to like make forward progress on my life's work of redoing of implementing these steering behaviors so but i can see it's and it is um you know it's a little bit unfair because if you add up venus road and rose and riddler there's more votes than just containment although containment just got a huge burst all of a sudden so i'm gonna take this as uh gospel and let's go and start to actually work on the containment steering behavior so uh simon who is um oh and i need to go back to the oh i'm not in the live chat uh channel anymore um now i'm back look at the classic not the express that must have been related to the um radish pie i don't know but i think i'm going with containment based on the votes of the poll um and for have starting point for me i would love to hear it um how do you all feel i think what i'm gonna look i've got 25 minutes it's probably gonna take two or three minutes to reboot the router but the stream keeps crashing and the only thing i can think to do other than restart the computer would be to reboot the router restarting the computer feels much more um of an extreme thing because i've got everything set up the way that i've got things going i'm by the way i've purchased a new streaming computer because i do currently this one does not have the camera just went off are you serious yeah okay i'm gonna reboot the router camera's off i'll work on that so the stream is 100 going to go down but it will come back up say something hello i'm waiting to see a message from somebody confirming that you can hear and see me oh wow there's no everybody left wow rebooting the router is definitely did that end the stream hopefully not let me see if i can pull it up see me oh wow there's no everybody left oh no i'm back rebooting a router is def okay oh maybe people are coming back now people are coming back watch that number go up okay uh there we go all right maybe people are coming back maybe they actually didn't leave but everything got disconnected um all right so here i am back oh eric is in the chat i think i just saw eric why is this not showing up and i totally forgot um hi eric uh thank you for joining today um actually let me just if you'll indulge me for a second i want to just make a really quick plug of eric's gofundme if somebody could paste it into the chat one of the mods could paste the link i think you'll find it was recently on my twitter so eric is a dedicated viewer of the coding train i mean i don't wanna you're not so dedicated you don't have to be dedicated but i feel like you're dedicated you have corresponded with for uh many years i had a bicycle accident i think i met eric first when i had a bicycle accident and i broke my elbow and my wrist and i couldn't use either of my arms to type and i experimented with trying to use voice control i didn't get so far it was just a big learning curve and by the time i had learned how to do some things i was gaining use back and also just took a break so but um eric is disabled and works with his computer entirely through voice control that's really amazing and needs a new computer so i hope the coding train community could support um eric in helping him get um a new computer so i don't know if that got posted yet into the chat i haven't seen it i will pull it up myself i'm just going to go to twitter.com shiffman which is where you can find the link and there you go so uh find this gofundme link and if you're able to support please do okay now containment we're not going to get super far with this but i'm excited to at least get it started um it will lead me to the next videos that are coming out that have already been recorded are path following so if you're following along with my steering behavior obsession i have let's just look at these examples implemented of seek and flee pursuant of aid which i messed up so i think i need to record i'm going to make a little note here pursue and evade correction so that's a video i need to make if you're wondering i'm i'm look writing this stuff down here uh wander is done arrival is done obstacle avoidance is one um obstacles containment uh wall following so path following is done flow field following i have an example of but i don't know that i've ever explicitly made a video just about it other than some really old ones um so then a crowd path following leader following unlike so i'm not going to worry about these group ones but because i want to get through all of the simple behaviors first so it looks like i need to the videos that i need to make are on pursue and evade the correction obstacle avoidance containment and wall following and i believe that i have heard from my and by the way it hasn't crashed again right from my uh another dedicated viewer of the coding train simon that um that containment would be a good one for me to start with so let's go to it uh i um i didn't do any random numbers today and how come i lost the page the containment on it oh here it is so this is a little confusing to me because it is lumping it together in the paper with wall following but um i'm just creating a new page um but um i think i'm gonna be able to parse this okay variations on path following okay it's a variation on path falling that's good um obstacle avoidance is uh definitely the hardest of the three says simon wall following means to approach a wall or other surface or path what if by the way what if instead of making this full screen i kind of put this up in the corner here so if i start trying to diagram stuff while i'm reading this you'll be able to see both okay let's try this see how this goes wall following means to approach a wall or other surface or path than to maintain a certain offset from it okay containment refers to the motion which is restricted to remain within a certain region okay so just thinking about this let's start with like the simplest possible case i have a 2d canvas i have a vehicle and its job is to never is to stay within the canvas so that's containment okay and i've made my own version of this in a weird sort of way i think in the nature of code book i talk about having a steering behavior or a force that just emanates from the edges but that's probably my implementation is probably overly simplistic or different than here fish swimming in aquarium hockey players skating within an ice rink to implement first predict a character's future location great so that's something i can always do right look at the current velocity and predict its future location okay this is actually working quite well having the diagram like this i kind of like this if it is inside the allowed region no corrective steering is necessary otherwise we steer toward the allowed region this can be accomplished by using seek with an inside point oh wow this is starting to sound easier than i thought it might be so um so let's let's i don't even need to read any further obviously there's more to do but let's create a basic example so i think what i want to do and unfortunately the problem with my little method here is i have very little screen space for coding but let's open up um steering and these are my corrections let's look at i'm trying to remember this is pursue wander um let's look at i think this um let's look at i'm trying to remember where i first do a future location well wander does that let's just go to wander i'm so silly um so i'm gonna go to wander the very basic wonder okay so i'm gonna duplicate it and i'm gonna call this containment okay i'm gonna give myself much more space for the code i'm going to move this back over here and so the diagram stuff is going to be pretty small let's go to the sketch let's make this just like 300 by 200. there we go okay and i one thing i want to do right now as interesting as it is is let me take out this history thing because it is not as relevant here okay and whoops so now let's also take out this so i'm just trying to simplify wander for a moment and i need to write a new function called containment so it probably would make sense for this function to be something like um you know to receive like a region that you're being contained in but i'm going to make a again a lot of over simplistic i'm going to simplify this possible scenario space by just considering that the actual canvas is the region so the first thing that i need to do is get a prediction which i can do by and i'm kind of doing what i've done in other so this would make sense like predicting the future location probably would make sense to break that out into a separate function entirely because it's a repetitive task that's happening in multiple steering behaviors but for the sake of argument right now i'm going to keep it right here i'm going to say let's look at um it's future location like uh let's say like a 30 frames from now and let's add that to this position the position and uh draw a red dot and sometimes i like just using stroke which is sort of silly but uh and then say uh point at this step uh prediction x and this prediction y okay so all i'm doing so far is that i've got the vehicle i look at its velocity i make a longer version of the velocity and then i add that to the position right that's the position and i get this future location and i draw it red so hopefully if i run this cannot read property of undefined where is this push happening ah okay let's take this out and also instead of wander let's call containment uh cannot read property undefined of x where tell me where vehicle js line 35 i spelled it wrong good job no prediction equals this.velocity.copy add this position oh it's i put this prediction ah this is taking me much too long to find this clip oh i can't even find it there we go um okay let's see what we got now there we go okay great so we see i'm predicting the future location and let's predict it 100 frames ahead which is just and now basically what's the next step in containment if it is inside the allowed region no corrective steering is necessary so i need to know is it inside the um i still keep looking at my watch 10 minutes left and i'm really really struggling for energy and brain power here any suggestions for what i have lent for lunch today a nice salad with some beans maybe so this is going to be to be continued but so one thing that i probably would want to build for myself is generic functions to determine if um some particular spot is inside uh some particular region and i believe that i've maybe done this with looking at like is a point inside a polygon maybe i only did it in convex or concave or whatever thank you marvel man but um i think so let's let's let's do this in a sort of let's build the tools to be sort of more generic but um keep it sort of simple so i'm gonna write a function just called contains and a vector so i need like a region so i i want a generic function and oh the camera went off again i think it's overheating this is what's going on because it's fully charged wow so uh youtube mem youtube members or anyone when i announce on friday morning that i'm going to be live streaming like a couple hours from now your response should be did you eat breakfast uh simon's telling me that the diagram really explains this well which i can see that it does ah yeah so like we can see this like look at this ah this is great thank you simon so we can sort of see what's going on here right i've got this one if the point is outside the region somehow project a point back in and that's the steering target do nothing here do nothing here here this is outside projected so i don't know exactly how to project this point looks like it's doing it as like a normal somehow to the sort of path of the wall um yeah i need to get a referral bro is telling me to get a fan on it that's definitely what i need to do it's quite warm i mean it won't be an issue once it's cooler weather um but i'm like there's no air conditioning in here and i'm in a garage it's kind of like half an outdoor space which i'm a little bit worried about having all this equipment in they may have suggestions for how to appropriately keep like do i need like dehumidifiers is that the thing that i should be getting for this um garage space um i know i'm uh okay so um let's uh let's write this function um but i'm going to comment this out and just say it is now contains so eventually i want to figure out how to define the region and figure out if the vector is within that region but i'm going to treat this in a very simple way by just saying as long as v dot x is less than width and i should actually just do return so i'm going to return v dot x is less than with and v dot x is greater than zero and v dot y is uh less than height and v dot y is greater than zero and i'm going to change this to i should probably do this no no that's fine this works because it's just the point okay so uh let's take a look oh it wow it when i auto formatted it put it all in one line um so now i should be able to say um here if contains prediction and let's do um i was going to change the color of the dot but as soon as the dot is out okay my audio should be back unfortunately now i'm using this mic which is maybe a good mic for podcasting if i'm talking really close up to it in a very very deep voiced kind of way but i know it's going to be really echoy and the audio won't be as good but as i have approximately two minutes left so much technical fail today um so and and i'm i'm kind of losing steam so i'm not i didn't this wasn't my best uh stream but pretty good for not having stream for a while from being in a brand new location with new equipment uh obviously it would have made sense if i could have done several practice streams before i came and did today but welcome to today's practice stream sponsored by brilliant i'm gonna wrap things up uh the audio is better this is better audio that seems crazy to me but maybe it is um uh it it will suffer from me like walking over here because now i'm like moved away from it or if i turn and talk in this direction versus turn and tonic in this direction but um um anyway so i think i've got to wrap this up i have to just uh i was gonna say quit while i'm ahead but i'm way behind so quit before i fall further behind i'm gonna read an explanation um it's a reflection like do you see the blue segment is the left yeah so so the next step here that i would need to do um and i think i can make this bigger is that basically if um if what i see is that the future location is here what i want to do is create a reflection i'm just looking at this which would go i guess like this oh sorry you can't see that which would reflect back so whatever this distance is this is a distance d ah i look for the distance so i'm going to be doing some kind of normal point finding just like i did in path following great so the tools of pathfinding will apply so i did i forgot i did this in path following uh the last mic was better okay i'm hearing hi stig um you're having dinner i haven't even had uh i had like literally like i had like of some blueberries this morning it's all i had as i was getting my kids ready for school so like kids at school i don't have to worry about they're like waiting for me to do something but apparently i forgot to feed myself um i had coffee uh not enough not enough sustenance to stream for two hours so i'm gonna do so this is in the path following videos which will be coming out as soon as i can get to reviewing and making the additional content for them do exactly this they take a given point project it onto some line segment this is scalar projection is what i'm doing or vector projection then whatever that distance is continue that normal out that same distance and then this is the target to which i will seek so i now understand uh i now understand that what i need to do so at a minimum this live stream was very useful for me i don't know uh it's harder for you maybe if you're new to things here to process this because i haven't released the path following examples yet but simon's been saying this to me probably for like six months and i can see now that he's absolutely right this containment will follow very well from um will follow really nicely from the path following content so i'll be able to so i will be back so i'm really um with the exception of what i will be october 22nd for sure um i will be live streaming every friday at this time i'm one thing i'm really hoping to do is establish a regular schedule i might like to do a poll in um i might like to do a poll in the discord about what like time on friday is best for everybody because i do have the flexibility to stream like earlier in the morning or a little later in the afternoon that i'm eastern time new york i'm you know on the east coast of the united states um so that i don't know if the mods want to help me remember this i do want to put out these polls about the new website stuff so that's first so join the discord there's another plug please join the discord um if you want to help engage with some of the surveys that we'll be putting out but i'm kind of curious to think about what time on friday might be best for the kind of global international audience um that there is um all right um yeah so will william asks what reference material are you using so in case this is um new to you here's where you want to look um so first of all all of this is coming from this paper 1991 paper steering behaviors for autonomous characters it's something that i'm working on working through i mean i've been working through this stuff since 2008 or probably even before that um a big source of inspiration for this also is um casey reese's work uh artworks and look at his process compendium which is a nice um um um this this particular set of videos about casey reese's work is highly relevant in braitenberg vehicles but um if you go to codingtrain youtube channel it should be here under nature of code two if i start to scroll through these once i get to oh well let me just go to here once i get to chapter five uh chapter five are all of is what i'm working on now the camera went off again this is so sad i'm just gonna i'm not even gonna try i'm gonna let it cool down for a minute so sorry um so um the the this the five point x series is me attempting to make a video about every one of these steering behaviors um and so uh you know if steering behaviors is new to you start with 5.1 but if a lot of this stuff about coding with vectors and motion is new to you then honestly i would start with 1.1 or even some of these other intro videos they don't necessarily um um it's not his exact sequence but 1.1 is where i would start um yeah so sorry for all the technical difficulties here the camera's shutting off the internet going in and out seems like rebooting the router really did fix that so maybe that's something i should just do every time before i stream uh the mic i have rechargeable batteries that i recharged for the lav mic all the way up to a hundred percent and i'm walking away from the mic down to turn the camera back on at least just say goodbye but i think i need new ones or something obviously didn't work so if you have thoughts or suggestions on ways that i can improve i'm really working on the setup here i'm curious what people thought of having this like ipad for diagrams versus um you know i'm just gonna um let's just do this really quick uh can i do this new uh well let me do it so i'm closing this out i'm gonna do this new movie recording because this is gonna be my rope oh no no no come on new movie recording oh yeah yeah i didn't have to close it i could just switched it to oh i bet you if i just plug in my oh wait a sec hold on can i just turn on the camera uh yeah ah there we go look at this okay so this is my setup a little bit you can see the outdoors there um this is like where i have a whiteboard and i would put another camera over there this is my new light oh you don't see any of this i'm not even showing you the screen that's so sad oh that was pathetic okay so uh here here i am um uh like here's me hi uh with my green screen uh and this is the space that's that mic and you can see uh gloria maybe gloria's maybe maybe uh my wife took gloria inside or she's sleeping somewhere in the grass where i can't see her um over here i should just reverse the camera i've never used like this uh over here you can see i have a white board and uh another tripod there which i was trying to put another camera on but i just need another kind of even put a little light over there but this is i knew this light is really awesome um i have two of these so i got a and i have this one i have some sound blankets and this is the camera there so you can see the setup that i'm kind of um working with now um this is a little like uh streaming pc i'm gonna give this to my son to be for his school and homework computer and get a new streaming computer um that can handle more inputs with a with a real capture card um so this hopefully gives you a little uh quick um behind the scenes and since my camera's not working um now you can see so uh and and david asked how many new studios have you had since december of 2019 so it's not my textbook i had i had uh do not disturb on so that my text messages wouldn't come through and one just came through so um anyway uh i'm wrapping up um it is so i started just recording videos in my little tiny office at nyu in the tisch building then i moved to a closet in the tisch building then i moved to brooklyn so i had a different closet in brooklyn which still exists that still exists i just haven't had time to go in there so i do have two studios right now but this is my my own space with my own equipment that i am putting all you know the sponsorship and the member stuff oh right now everything goes towards like building out this new studio and uh and also like the coding train team that's helping me with various things like video editing and social media and stuff like that so um thank you to brilliant and thank you to all of you who watch and support um i'm really hoping that this can become my own space that i can really have ownership over and kind of see where that leads so uh malu asks how old i am i am 48 years old uh my dream by the way i'd probably do this my 50th birthday i want to go on a like train ride maybe in like a scotland or like through alaska i don't know there's i went on this amazing train in norway once i want to go on a like trip so tell me all of your best like you know look i don't i don't that didn't be luxury but i just mean like an overnight where the train ride itself is the experience um i think they have some yeah i i think i saw one that looked interesting in scotland but maybe there's so let me know thank you william uh and so i um i want this to be the setup though where i can both record videos so i do extra streams for members which are my recording sessions but i don't have all the equipment yet to do that and i got to stop i got to say goodbye i love you all every single one of you watching right now i really appreciate you and um transsiberian india says i should have never been to india it's a little traveling is a little complicated right now uh with the global pandemic i hope everybody's doing okay but um i hope to get back to it i'm exhausted i'm gonna go eat lunch i'm gonna say goodbye uh you're gonna hear this dot song and see the outro thing again if you wanna support me um uh uh um watch send me a nice um comment somewhere on youtube like a video is a thing people can do uh join sign up for brilliant that's probably the primary way right now that you should support uh and there's also the membership and all sorts of other things like that um i gotta stop talking i gotta find the this dot song i'm sorry i didn't read any random numbers by the way if you are a member in the chat and you received your whistle post about uh if you like it it's like laser etched oh hold on i can do this now i'm going to show you this whistle i swear i'm i swear i'm stopping hopefully no more embarrassing text messages will come in uh one more uh where's the movie recording i minimized it i want to show this to you all uh i need so um okay take a look at this this is your you can have this this is your very my very own laser etched coding train train whistle and it has on this side a um i don't know why i can't okay there we go where's the camera on this thing it has on this side i should get out a portrait it has and i'm sorry that this is inverted this is a random walk pattern that is using the random numbers from the random number book that i use this is the number and this is the position in the book that started this pattern um i'm giving these as gifts for uh members youtube members of the coding train starting with the conductor and above level but maybe eventually everybody will get them uh thank you for watching i will see you next time next friday same time right probably the same time next friday i will have eaten breakfast thank you so much uh uh yeah that's it that's all i got goodbye i don't have the music page open i'm like totally lost here uh there we go as always i always forget that this stop muting my microphone this dot this dot song never forget the this dot somebody composed that song for me i'm gonna say once again here we go sing it with me it's the forward coordinate song it's the forward to cartesian coordination autotune and the internet will fix that for me sing it with me it's the new cartesian coordinate unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what i get i'm really losing my mind okay let's do it the kittens the kittens kids kittens and kittens the kittens the kittens kittens and kittens and kittens the kittens the kittens kittens i feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this is a this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it i'm really getting to something i need my sound effect what else is there unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes that was invalid syntax i forgot uh there was one other thing here that i think is important that i will use continuously over and over again all sorts of text generation analysis things that i will use continuously over and over again first thing i need to do is yes goodbye everybody i've already turned the camera off so i can't come back to say goodbye but i'm ending the stream now i could just find where that button is to
