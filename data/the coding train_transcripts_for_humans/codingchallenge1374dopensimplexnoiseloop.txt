00:00 - (horn toots)
00:01 - - Hello, welcome to a coding challenge
00:03 - entitled 4D Open Simplex Noise Loop.
00:07 - That's got to be a click bait title
00:09 - if I ever heard one, right?
00:10 - (laughs)
00:12 - Anyway, let me thank somebody.
00:14 - The artist Etienne Jacob,
who I've referred to
00:17 - in like the last 307 coding
challenge videos that I've made,
00:22 - because I keep doing this
topic over and over again,
00:24 - has been really an
inspiration for these videos.
00:27 - Makes these amazing noise loop GIFs,
00:31 - and I've talked a little
bit about some techniques
00:34 - for doing that using classic Perlin noise,
00:36 - the noise function in processing,
00:38 - which you can also refer
to as fractal noise.
00:41 - Recently, through feedback and research,
00:43 - been turned on to this
idea of Simplex Noise
00:48 - and Open Simplex Noise
and I made an entire video
00:51 - all about that and the
differences and a little bit
00:54 - about the history there.
00:55 - I'll refer you to that video
if you want to find out more.
00:58 - In this particular video,
all I'm going to do
01:01 - is I now have the
processing 3D noise example,
01:06 - which you'll see nothing
is three-dimensional here.
01:10 - There's really a two-dimensional space
01:12 - of noise and the third dimension
01:14 - is what's creating the animation frame.
01:17 - You can think of that third
dimension almost as time.
01:19 - I'm seeing frame by frame by frame.
01:21 - What I want to do with this
is take this and make it loop.
01:26 - I want to have this noisy scene,
01:28 - and this is using Open Simplex Noise,
01:30 - which has a different
quality and character to it.
01:33 - It has less what are known
as directional artifacts
01:36 - that I referred to in the previous video
01:37 - as like this herky jerky feeling
of what the noise algorithm
01:41 - can sometimes do if you
also stop and turn around.
01:43 - The smoothness of this is quite pleasant
01:46 - and has a visual quality that's,
01:48 - for a lot of scenarios, better.
01:51 - There's more to say about that,
01:53 - you can go watch the other video.
01:55 - What I want to do is make this
run just over a few seconds
01:58 - and then render it as a
GIFs that loops seamlessly.
02:01 - I took a quick break there just
02:02 - to render out that processing sketch.
02:05 - I rendered out a few
seconds, and as you'll see,
02:07 - I rendered it to a GIF
and every few seconds,
02:10 - you see this jarring thing happen
02:12 - where it goes back to the beginning.
02:13 - The last frame of this noisy scene
02:15 - doesn't match the first frame.
02:17 - This is something that I talked about
02:19 - in previous coding challenge videos,
02:21 - how to get a sequence of values,
02:24 - a one-dimensional array of random values
02:27 - where the last value
matches up with the first.
02:29 - You close that loop.
02:31 - The way that I did that was, I
want one dimension of values,
02:35 - let me walk around a circle,
02:38 - a circular path in a 2D noise space.
02:41 - Now what we're doing is
02:43 - I want two-dimensional looping values,
02:48 - so I need to basically walk
around to space of a torus.
02:52 - I need all of these values to
move around and come on back.
02:57 - First, what I want to do is...
02:59 - Let me just be clear, this is
03:00 - the processing noise 3D
example and the only changed
03:04 - is I've added this OpenSimplex
Noise code from Kurt Spencer.
03:09 - I will link to where that
code and some background
03:11 - about this open source
implementation where it comes from
03:13 - in the video's description.
03:14 - Instead of calling
Processing's noise function,
03:18 - I'm calling noise.eval from
Kurt Spencer's OpenSimplex Noise
03:23 - and that gives me a double,
03:25 - so I have to convert that into a float.
03:26 - It also gives me a range
of values between -1 and 1,
03:28 - which is different than
the values between 0 and 1.
03:30 - What I would like to do is make this
03:33 - a bit more visually
obvious what's going on,
03:36 - so I'm going to change this.
03:38 - I'm going to threshold this
03:39 - to render the color either black or white.
03:42 - One way I can do that
03:43 - is with a nice little ternary expression.
03:45 - I can say brightness equals,
03:47 - like is noise greater than zero?
03:50 - If the noise value that comes
out is greater than zero,
03:52 - then I want to see 255,
03:55 - otherwise I want to see 0.
03:58 - If I do that, you'll see we get this.
04:01 - I can play with the increment values,
04:04 - like maybe let me make the
increment a little less
04:07 - but make it go through the
zSpace faster, I don't know.
04:11 - So, now we can see.
04:12 - So this, this would be...
04:14 - I should've rendered this to a GIF,
04:16 - so you could see it not looping,
04:17 - but this is what I want to have loop.
04:20 - Also, look at the beauty of
this particular noise algorithm.
04:23 - It's very smooth, it
doesn't feel like it's...
04:27 - It doesn't have that
directional art effect.
04:29 - It doesn't feel like it's
slowing down to a stop
04:31 - and then going backwards,
it just keeps going
04:34 - with this kind of beautiful
organic randomness.
04:36 - Now that I have this, let's
turn this into a GIF loop.
04:42 - All of these videos are
now kind of, this series,
04:44 - everything's depending on each other.
04:45 - I did have a previous coding challenge
04:48 - where I made processing
code that just renders out
04:52 - the frames for a GIF loop
and at the demonstration
04:56 - is just a rotating square.
04:57 - What I want to do is, I'm
going to use that as my basis.
05:01 - Let me grab all the code
before set up from here,
05:06 - which is all of this.
05:08 - I'm going to put that
into my GIF loop code.
05:12 - Then, I wanted to make the
new OpenSimplexNoise object,
05:16 - and I'm going to put that in here.
05:19 - Now, it's complaining
to me, it doesn't know
05:20 - what OpenSimplexNoise is, so
I do need to make a new tab.
05:24 - I'm going to call it
OpenSimplexNoise.java.
05:30 - And... whoops.
05:31 - It needs to be .java
because this particular
05:35 - OpenSimplexNoise class
is using some features
05:38 - of the Java programming language
05:39 - that don't work super
elegantly in processing.
05:42 - I can then just go copy and paste it over.
05:45 - Certainly, there's more streamlined ways
05:48 - of importing a Java class,
05:50 - but just copying it over is one way.
05:51 - Then I'm going to come back to here
05:53 - and what I'm going to do is
everything that's in draw()
05:58 - is what should go into
06:03 - this render function.
06:05 - This render function should now
06:07 - have all of the drawing code.
06:11 - Here, now we have this running.
06:12 - It's not looping yet, I've
got to figure that out.
06:14 - I also want to give myself
more frames probably and...
06:20 - Actually let's make it short,
06:21 - 'cause I really want to
make sure it's looping.
06:26 - Let's make it 640 by 360,
06:28 - it's kind of nice to
have that aspect ratio.
06:31 - Now, this is what I want to
render as a perfect loop.
06:37 - So, what's going on?
06:40 - Here's the thing, the
thing that needs to loop
06:43 - is the z-axis, the z-axis
instead of moving forward in time
06:49 - should move around in a circular path
06:52 - to create that donut in
three-dimensional space.
06:55 - How do I do that exactly?
06:58 - It turns out that the way I can do that
07:00 - is let me actually get rid
of this idea of z offset
07:03 - and I want to have...
07:05 - Let's see if I can diagram this.
07:07 - Alright, this is my
two-dimensional plane of noise
07:12 - in three-dimensional space
and at any given point,
07:16 - what I want to do is kind
of walk around in a circle.
07:22 - If this were the flat plane,
07:23 - the circle would come out like this.
07:25 - I don't know if this is really...
07:26 - So, what I need is an angle.
07:27 - I need to rotate around,
07:29 - I need to use that polar
coordinate formula,
07:31 - to rotate around a circular path within
07:33 - one plane of three-dimensional space.
07:38 - To do that, I used four-dimensional noise,
07:40 - because what I'm doing here is, I get...
07:45 - Remember, in looping a
GIF, I want a percentage
07:48 - from 0 to 100%, so I can
not now have an angle
07:52 - which is equal to map that percent
07:57 - which goes between 0 and
1, to between 0 and TWO_PI.
08:03 - Then I can have, I'm going
to call this u offset
08:06 - for the third dimension
and I'm going to call this
08:09 - a v offset for the fourth dimension.
08:12 - What those are is I'm going
to say cosine of the angle
08:19 - and sine of the angle, right?
08:21 - I'm going to use the polar
08:23 - to Cartesian coordinate transformation
08:25 - and map these values,
08:29 - which go between 0 and 1.
08:33 - No, sorry, they go between
-1 and 1, to between
08:39 - some noise radius and noise diameter.
08:43 - This is a concept I talked about
08:45 - in the previous looping video,
08:49 - but it's very hard to type
and talk at the same time.
08:51 - Sometimes I do a good
job, sometimes I'm a mess,
08:53 - and right now I'm a mess.
08:54 - This is very hard to explain.
08:55 - This is exactly the same
technique that I did
08:59 - in the first noise loop video,
09:01 - where I just had an x and a y.
09:03 - Now, I have an x and a y, but the looping
09:06 - is happening in the u and the v.
09:07 - That's where the size of
this circle is important.
09:14 - I'm not sure whether in the
Open Simplex Noise algorithm
09:16 - whether I can have negative values or not,
09:18 - but to be safe, I'm just going
to map these between 0 and 2.
09:22 - I'm picking sort of an
arbitrary, this I think we called
09:25 - noise diameter or something like that,
09:28 - I'm picking an arbitrary value.
09:29 - Now, down here, change
this to u offset, v offset,
09:37 - and let's run this.
09:38 - Did I get everything right?
09:40 - No, no.
09:42 - Oh, I have an extra 0 in here,
09:44 - because I'm going crazy.
09:48 - z offset is not a thing anymore,
09:50 - and here we go.
09:52 - (bell dings)
09:53 - Okay, so one this to note here,
09:54 - (laughs)
09:56 - is that 4D,
09:58 - the implementation for getting
4D noise is quite slow.
10:03 - You can see this frame rate
sort of chugging along.
10:06 - The good news is we're here
to render out to a loop,
10:09 - so I don't care about the
speed, the frame rate,
10:12 - I am just going to turn record to true
10:14 - and I'm going to run this again
10:16 - and I will see you when
it finishes rendering.
10:19 - (playful synth music)
10:23 - All right, it finished rendering.
10:25 - The good news, just to reiterate,
10:27 - because 3D noise worked quite smoothly,
10:29 - if you're not rendering out to a loop,
10:32 - you don't need that fourth dimension!
10:34 - You can just use the third dimension
10:36 - and watch your real-time software
10:38 - in your media art
installation work beautifully.
10:40 - But, if you're rendering it
out, I want to close that loop,
10:43 - I do need that fourth dimension.
10:45 - Okay, I'm going to switch
over to my terminal window
10:49 - and I'm in the GIF_loop_4D sketches folder
10:52 - and now I'm going to use ffmpeg
10:54 - to render all those frames into a GIF.
10:56 - So, I'm going to say ffmpeg -for image2,
11:02 - and ffmpeg is a utility
11:03 - you would have to install separately.
11:04 - I'll include a link to how to do that
11:06 - in this video's description.
11:08 - - f image2 -framerate, let's
give it 30 frames per second,
11:12 - - i, the file path, which is output/gif...
11:18 - Each file is gif dash and then a number,
11:21 - so %3d.png and then I'll
call it noiseloop.gif
11:28 - and I'm going to render that out.
11:30 - I am going to take a
look at it, here it is.
11:33 - Let's take a look.
11:36 - By golly, if that doesn't
loop, I don't know what loops.
11:40 - This is about four seconds long.
11:42 - Of course, you can see.
11:45 - (laughs)
11:47 - You might be able to detect
the loop because it's so short,
11:50 - but if I made I a little longer
and if there was a bit more,
11:53 - if I was more artistic and
had more creative ideas
11:56 - about how to vary the visual quality,
11:58 - we might be able to
create something more like
12:01 - what I showed you in those
original Etienne Jacob GIFs.
12:07 - Hi, so this might be the strangest,
12:09 - most nontraditional ending of
a coding training video ever,
12:13 - 'cause you probably were just watching me
12:15 - in the studio coding,
but I was going to record
12:17 - a new ending to it today in the
studio, but it's a snow day.
12:20 - Just buried in snow here, can barely walk.
12:22 - (laughs)
12:24 - Anyway, what you have just
seen is a coding challenge
12:27 - where I added Open Simplex Noise.
12:30 - Really, I think what you
should take away from this
12:32 - is the quality of Open Simplex Noise
12:34 - rather than classic Perlin
noise and think about
12:36 - the kinds of projects you might
make that run in real time
12:40 - that don't actually need to loop.
12:41 - But, if you're making a looping GIF,
12:42 - this is sort of an interesting technique.
12:44 - I'm going to show you
right now this terrain.
12:47 - This is basically my
coding challenge before
12:50 - but with Open Simplex Noise
instead of classic Perlin noise.
12:56 - That's a challenge to you.
12:58 - If you can make this
looping terrain happen,
13:03 - then try that.
13:04 - I'm going to do that in a video,
I'll come back this Wednesday
13:06 - during my regular livestream
and I will create this terrain
13:10 - with Open Simplex Noise
as a follow up video.
13:13 - I hope you enjoyed this
short coding challenge
13:16 - with Open Simplex Noise and
looping in four dimensions
13:20 - and all sorts of wackiness like that,
13:22 - and I'll see you next time on
the coding train, choo choo!
13:25 - (upbeat pop music)

Each file is gif dash and then a number, so %3d.png and then I'll call it noiseloop.gif and I'm going to render that out. I am going to take a look at it, here it is. Let's take a look. By golly, if that doesn't loop, I don't know what loops. This is about four seconds long. Of course, you can see. (laughs) You might be able to detect the loop because it's so short, but if I made I a little longer and if there was a bit more, if I was more artistic and had more creative ideas about how to vary the visual quality, we might be able to create something more like what I showed you in those original Etienne Jacob GIFs. Hi, so this might be the strangest, most nontraditional ending of a coding training video ever, 'cause you probably were just watching me in the studio coding, but I was going to record a new ending to it today in the studio, but it's a snow day. Just buried in snow here, can barely walk. (laughs) Anyway, what you have just seen is a coding challenge where I added Open Simplex Noise. Really, I think what you should take away from this is the quality of Open Simplex Noise rather than classic Perlin noise and think about the kinds of projects you might make that run in real time that don't actually need to loop. But, if you're making a looping GIF, this is sort of an interesting technique. I'm going to show you right now this terrain. This is basically my coding challenge before but with Open Simplex Noise instead of classic Perlin noise. That's a challenge to you. If you can make this looping terrain happen, then try that. I'm going to do that in a video, I'll come back this Wednesday during my regular livestream and I will create this terrain with Open Simplex Noise as a follow up video. I hope you enjoyed this short coding challenge with Open Simplex Noise and looping in four dimensions and all sorts of wackiness like that, and I'll see you next time on the coding train, choo choo!
