00:01 - hi so I've got one last video here in
00:03 - this kind of section which has been all
00:05 - about objects in JavaScript in p5js and
00:08 - arrays you know I've been adding objects
00:10 - when you click the mouse I've been
00:12 - changing objects when you click the
00:13 - mouse on top of them been checking to
00:14 - see if the objects are overlapping each
00:16 - other deleting objects from the array
00:18 - been doing all these things and
00:19 - something that has come up quite a bit
00:21 - uh in the last week or two that I've
00:23 - heard this question is okay well what if
00:25 - so this example this kind of like
00:26 - bubbles example that I'm using over and
00:28 - over again what if I what if you want to
00:31 - display each one of these as an image an
00:33 - image that you're loading from a file
00:35 - rather than just drawing a circle and
00:37 - even more so what if you want each one
00:39 - of these to be a different image and
00:40 - each time you make one it like picks
00:42 - from a selection of images so I have
00:44 - this basic example all it's doing is an
00:46 - empty array every time you click the
00:48 - mouse it pushes an object into it and
00:50 - updates and displays all the objects so
00:52 - the main thing that I need to do Somehow
00:55 - Here is first load an image so I'm going
00:57 - to do this in the first sort of like
00:58 - simple GL mobile way in a way a way
01:01 - that's not going to solve the problem
01:02 - but will'll get us started so one thing
01:03 - I'll note is that I do already have this
01:06 - is the directory of this sketch notice
01:08 - there are two JavaScript files I've
01:10 - moved the bubble Constructor function
01:12 - into a separate Javascript file if you
01:14 - missed the previous video about how to
01:15 - do that you can go back and watch that
01:17 - um and then I added a directory called
01:20 - images and I put three flowers in it cuz
01:22 - I like
01:23 - flowers uh flower zero flower 1 flower 2
01:26 - and I very specifically name them with
01:29 - numbers for reason which I'll get to in
01:31 - a little bit but for right now let's
01:33 - just say this first pink flower I want
01:35 - all the images to look like that flower
01:38 - so uh you know this is I'm kind of
01:40 - glossing over a few details here but to
01:42 - load an image into P5 what you need is
01:45 - first a variable to refer to that image
01:48 - and then strangely enough I'm going to
01:51 - add another event here so this is a
01:53 - larger discussion about callbacks and
01:56 - the Order of things and the browser and
01:57 - how things work and I I want to have
01:59 - that convers
02:00 - in a few videos from now or really in
02:02 - the next video when I start talking
02:03 - about uh the P5 Dom library and how you
02:06 - can sort of start handling different
02:08 - kinds of events on the page but for
02:10 - right now a simple thing you can do is
02:12 - add this preload function which says in
02:14 - the preload function you want to load
02:17 - any media to make sure it's available
02:19 - for the sketch when it really starts in
02:21 - the setup function so the sketch starts
02:23 - in setup but now there's this like
02:24 - secret function that you can call before
02:26 - setup and this is really only for
02:28 - loading images loading sounds and later
02:30 - as you also see loading data files so if
02:32 - you're loading a spreadsheet or a big
02:35 - body of text that you're going to
02:36 - analyze and visualize you can also put
02:38 - those kind of things in preload so here
02:40 - I can say image equals load
02:43 - image and then in between quotes I need
02:47 - to put the path of the image the path
02:49 - relative to this particular project so
02:52 - again if I open up whoops the finder
02:53 - when you can see this is the project my
02:56 - images are in a directory called images
02:58 - not at all required but I'm doing that
03:00 - out of convenience is to not sort of
03:01 - like pollute the the root directory with
03:04 - a lot of additional files if I had 100
03:05 - images would sort of be hard to look at
03:07 - so here I have a separate directory
03:09 - images and I can go back to the code and
03:11 - just
03:13 - write images SL flower z. jpeg so other
03:18 - thing I'm going to do I'm going to leave
03:19 - the background at zero so now I have
03:22 - that image variable and where am I
03:25 - displaying the bubbles in the display
03:27 - function so all I need to do is go into
03:28 - that display function and instead of
03:30 - drawing a circle draw that image so here
03:33 - I can say oops I left something in here
03:34 - by accident instead of drawing a circle
03:36 - I can comment that out and I can just
03:38 - say image image I should have called it
03:41 - flower or something this.x this.y so the
03:45 - image is drawn at the object's XY
03:47 - location instead of drawing a circle
03:49 - draw that image and the fill and stroke
03:52 - are no longer relevant I could tint the
03:53 - image and there's other ways to change
03:55 - the image but that's not really relevant
03:56 - to the discussion here so now if I run
03:58 - this you can see that every time I click
04:00 - I get a flower now there's two things to
04:02 - note here number one is I get this white
04:05 - border images are rectangles they are
04:09 - rectangles they are rectangles they have
04:11 - pixels and columns and rows they're a
04:13 - rectangle now if you if I had been
04:16 - better about this and made this flower
04:18 - image as a PNG file type with
04:21 - transparency then I could have those
04:23 - pixels around the edges of the flowers
04:25 - be transparent in this case I might kind
04:27 - of just use a kind of little bit bit of
04:29 - a trick here and say background
04:33 - 255 and you know now it kind of looks
04:36 - right now if I put two on top of each
04:37 - other you can see that that edge is
04:39 - still there I'll let you when you make
04:41 - your own flowers make better flowers
04:44 - than me but you can see this is kind
04:45 - important to think about as you're
04:47 - starting to work with images in your
04:48 - sketch the other thing I'll note here is
04:51 - notice where I click right here I'm
04:53 - going can't right here I'm going to
04:54 - click where's the image I clicked in the
04:57 - corner the image popped up in the corner
04:59 - so just like a rectangle has its
05:01 - reference point in the top left corner
05:03 - an image does also and in this case I
05:05 - would prefer the reference point to be
05:06 - the center I don't know why but I would
05:08 - just prefer that and so something you
05:10 - can do also with images just like you
05:12 - could do with rectangles is say image
05:14 - mode Center so image mode Center is a P5
05:18 - function that now each time I click you
05:20 - can see an image comes up in the center
05:22 - so we've got this
05:23 - working through the use of a global
05:26 - variable so here in the main sketch I lo
05:29 - the image into that Global variable then
05:31 - I access the global variable in the
05:34 - object but this does not solve our
05:36 - problem the problem that we have is
05:38 - every time we click we want to see a
05:40 - different flower image how do we do that
05:43 - each bubble has its own image each
05:45 - bubble has its own image I'll say it one
05:47 - more time each bubble has if I say three
05:49 - times the code for it appears it doesn't
05:51 - do that but would be nice wouldn't it I
05:53 - should make a system that does that so
05:54 - but the reason why I'm saying each
05:56 - bubble has its own image the answer that
05:58 - you should be thinking is that means
06:00 - each bubble needs an image property it
06:02 - needs its own variable it needs its own
06:04 - variable to store an image so the bubble
06:07 - should store an image so I don't know
06:10 - what this should be equal to
06:12 - yet but this is the idea somehow the
06:17 - bubble gets its own image and the
06:19 - bubbles own this do image not the global
06:22 - variable image not one image for all
06:24 - bubbles but each bubble with its own
06:26 - image that's the big distinction here
06:28 - now of course the question is how do we
06:30 - fill that
06:32 - image so there's a bunch of different
06:35 - ways you could do this but I'm going to
06:37 - suggest a way that I think is rather
06:39 - nice for this particular scenario notice
06:41 - how the bubble gets its X and Y
06:43 - initialized by an AR a parameter that
06:46 - comes in function bubble XY that X is
06:49 - like a handoff variable it gets filled
06:52 - and it gets passed to this.x the Y gets
06:54 - filled gets passed to this. Y so what is
06:57 - what is the bubbles XY initialized in
06:59 - the code
07:00 - here Mouse X Mouse y so what I would
07:03 - like to do and I'm going to change this
07:05 - just to make things make a little more
07:07 - sense I'm going to call this flower so I
07:09 - have one flower image and what I do is
07:11 - when I make the bubble I want to send
07:13 - that flower image to the bubble make the
07:16 - bubble at Mouse X Mouse y with this
07:18 - flower image make the bubble at this
07:20 - mouse X Mouse y with the flower image so
07:23 - this is calling the Constructor Mouse X
07:26 - Mouse Y and flower go
07:28 - into bubble. JS right here x y and what
07:34 - now I need a third parameter image which
07:36 - fills the bubbles this. image now this
07:39 - is a little bit confusing like it's kind
07:42 - of like oh I don't know if I should be
07:44 - doing it this way I it's so convenient
07:45 - though like this is called XY image and
07:48 - this is called XY image there's a big
07:50 - huge difference though between thisx and
07:53 - plain old X plain old X is just a
07:56 - parameter for the Constructor function
07:57 - to receive a value and pass it to this.x
08:01 - this.x it's the real deal it's the
08:03 - variable for that object's Exposition so
08:06 - you could call these like temporary X or
08:08 - temporary y or handoff X or handoff Y
08:11 - but it's convenient actually just to
08:12 - call them XY image and they get they get
08:15 - filled and then they pass the that value
08:17 - into this.x this. y this that image this
08:19 - is really going to give you a headache
08:21 - and I apologize for this if I could make
08:24 - all of this just make instant sense I I
08:26 - absolutely would so maybe you have a
08:28 - better an idea for how to think about
08:30 - this but this is one of the more
08:30 - confusing things but if we take that now
08:33 - I think if you look at it this way we
08:35 - get three arguments Mouse X Mouse y
08:38 - flower image and those come into the
08:40 - object so
08:42 - now here we go I've got the same sketch
08:45 - but I have a much more flexible object I
08:48 - can initialize that bubble with
08:50 - different flower images and how might I
08:53 - initialize that bubble with different
08:54 - flower images how about I have an array
08:57 - so let's go oops let's go back back to
08:59 - here I never and the nice thing is I
09:01 - don't have to touch this code again the
09:02 - bubble is now a generic bubble that can
09:04 - display any image you pass to it so now
09:06 - I just need a way of passing different
09:08 - images to it right there not just this
09:11 - one Global flower but different ones so
09:14 - what I'm going to say is flowers equals
09:16 - brackets and I'm going to say flowers
09:19 - index0 is flowers Z flowers index one is
09:24 - flower one I need to change that and
09:26 - flowers index 2
09:29 - is flowers two look at this one two so
09:32 - now you can see I'm loading three images
09:34 - into an array load flower zero into the
09:37 - zero zero spot one into the one spot two
09:38 - into the two spot now down here what
09:42 - could I do I could say flowers zero
09:44 - let's just be crazy and say flowers one
09:47 - and I run this and you can see look at
09:48 - that I'm getting the red flowers if I
09:50 - say flowers
09:52 - two oops I'm getting the yellow flowers
09:56 - and if I say flowers
09:58 - zero I'm getting the pink flowers
10:01 - flowers flowers everywhere flowers so
10:03 - all I need to do is vary that value
10:06 - instead of me hardcoding in zero or one
10:07 - or two every time I don't know I could
10:09 - pick a random value I could or I could
10:11 - cycle through them let's cycle through
10:13 - them I like that idea ah let's pick the
10:15 - random one so if I say VAR R equals
10:18 - random what's the range of random values
10:21 - I want the array has three elements in
10:24 - it indices 0 through two so I want a
10:28 - random value between between 0 and three
10:31 - better yet I want a random value between
10:32 - zero and the length of the array now I
10:35 - don't know that I've mentioned this in a
10:37 - previous video but random will give you
10:40 - a decimal
10:41 - value so I'm getting 0.457 or 2.3 61 I
10:47 - want to get rid of that decimal value
10:49 - and there's a function in P5 which is
10:52 - comes from JavaScript called floor this
10:54 - is a little bit of a digression but I
10:56 - think it's worth mentioning if I have
10:58 - the number three
11:01 - 3967 I could floor that number and it's
11:06 - going to give me the value three I could
11:08 - ceiling that number and it's going to
11:11 - give me the value four so floor always
11:13 - takes off the decimal point and goes
11:15 - down to three ceiling takes off the
11:17 - decimal point and goes up to the next
11:19 - number and there's also round which
11:21 - whether it's above 3.5 or below 3.5
11:23 - it'll go to either three or four so
11:25 - these are kind of important little
11:26 - mathematical helper functions in this
11:28 - case I want the floor function CU I want
11:30 - this to be a random value in the array I
11:33 - don't want I only want to get 0o one or
11:36 - two so if I put the floor function in
11:38 - there and now I put R here oh I think I
11:41 - just finished this uh except for one
11:42 - step I can run this and every time I
11:46 - click I will get a different flower
11:48 - randomly right there's only three
11:50 - flowers in the array but a random one is
11:53 - passed into every object I have as many
11:55 - objects as I want and they'll all refer
11:57 - to one of those uh images in the AR
11:59 - array now there's one last piece of this
12:01 - that I could improve which is if you
12:03 - look at the way I did this preload is
12:05 - it's very hardcoded Right Flowers index
12:07 - zero flowers index one flowers index 2
12:09 - it would be much nicer if I could say
12:12 - for VAR I equals 0 I is less than 3 I ++
12:17 - flowers index I equals load image
12:23 - something now what's the
12:26 - something what's the something that I
12:28 - put there so so I know I have i counting
12:30 - 012 so somehow I need this text to be
12:33 - dynamic images flower zero images flower
12:36 - 1 images are to it's dynamic as the
12:39 - index in the array also want the text to
12:40 - be dynamic and there's a trick that you
12:42 - can use to do this so uh you probably
12:45 - are familiar with this statement 2 + 2
12:48 - equals say it with me I know you're just
12:50 - watching somewhere by yourself maybe at
12:52 - the gym on a treadmill it's weird to
12:53 - just say the number four but say the
12:55 - number four I don't you probably not
12:57 - have the JY on a treadmill but somebody
12:59 - once said to me I watch your videos at
13:00 - the gy so that's why I said that uh okay
13:03 - so uh 2 + 2 equal 4 right we're all
13:07 - comfortable with that but if I have the
13:09 - text like
13:11 - cow plus Bell this equals cow bell so
13:17 - the plus with text with characters
13:20 - between quotes means concatenation or
13:23 - join so plus with numbers is addition
13:25 - plus with text is join so we can use
13:28 - that fact here with a trick I can say
13:32 - what do I want to make I want to say
13:33 - images
13:35 - slfl whoops come back to me plus I right
13:40 - I want to always start images flower and
13:42 - then I either want a zero one or two and
13:44 - I is a zero one or two and then what do
13:46 - I want after that
13:49 - plus uh jpeg so you can see this is the
13:54 - full string that I want flower a number
13:57 - and jpeg FL power plus a number plus.
14:01 - jpeg not add those things together join
14:03 - those things together so if I do that I
14:06 - don't need this anymore I can get rid of
14:08 - these three lines of code and here we go
14:11 - I can
14:12 - now click and add random flowers with
14:15 - different images now of course up here
14:18 - like this depends on that you name the
14:20 - files this way this only works because I
14:22 - name the files flower zero flower 1
14:24 - flower two the nice thing is here is I
14:27 - if I had a th000 flower images I could
14:29 - put those all in the directory it would
14:31 - take a while to load 1 th images but it
14:32 - would work so this is something I think
14:34 - you can really play with in terms of how
14:37 - you can load a whole bunch of images
14:39 - pick them either in sequence or randomly
14:42 - I try the in sequence thing might be
14:43 - interesting and put them and use those
14:46 - objects to display an image so hopefully
14:48 - this was helpful to you one thing I
14:50 - would like to say at just the end of
14:51 - this video is I need to do a much better
14:53 - job of linking to like download the code
14:56 - that I'm doing in these examples if I
14:58 - reference a previous video I should have
15:00 - a link to that previous video in the
15:01 - description if you could help me with
15:03 - that I would be super appreciative of of
15:05 - it uh so um so you can actually just put
15:08 - in the comments like so first of all if
15:10 - you're typing the code along and you
15:12 - have it you can email it to me um but
15:14 - you just like say like the code for this
15:15 - is missing where can I find it or you
15:17 - know what you reference this video
15:18 - here's a link to that video If you give
15:20 - me those things I will just like
15:21 - remember to add them uh to videos so uh
15:24 - if you have a chance to help with that I
15:25 - would certainly appreciate it and the
15:27 - next set of videos I'm going to make is
15:29 - about how to add things to a P5 sketch
15:32 - that aren't just the canvas how can you
15:35 - add other types of elements that might
15:37 - appear on a web page a header a button a
15:40 - paragraph of text how do you manipulate
15:42 - those things with code so I'm super
15:44 - excited about that topic because it's
15:45 - kind of a new thing for me and I think
15:48 - it'll really expand the possibilities of
15:50 - what you can do with JavaScript and the
15:51 - browser np5 and all this stuff so I will
15:54 - hopefully get to making those videos
15:55 - soon and see you in this way that I see
15:59 - you I feel that I see you you are there
16:01 - to me uh sometime okay
16:05 - goodbye uh I have to stop I'm still here
16:08 - by the way I could just stay here right
16:10 - this video could just go on and on just
16:11 - stay here and but I'm not I'm going to
16:13 - stop okay goodbye

Cleaned transcript:

hi so I've got one last video here in this kind of section which has been all about objects in JavaScript in p5js and arrays you know I've been adding objects when you click the mouse I've been changing objects when you click the mouse on top of them been checking to see if the objects are overlapping each other deleting objects from the array been doing all these things and something that has come up quite a bit uh in the last week or two that I've heard this question is okay well what if so this example this kind of like bubbles example that I'm using over and over again what if I what if you want to display each one of these as an image an image that you're loading from a file rather than just drawing a circle and even more so what if you want each one of these to be a different image and each time you make one it like picks from a selection of images so I have this basic example all it's doing is an empty array every time you click the mouse it pushes an object into it and updates and displays all the objects so the main thing that I need to do Somehow Here is first load an image so I'm going to do this in the first sort of like simple GL mobile way in a way a way that's not going to solve the problem but will'll get us started so one thing I'll note is that I do already have this is the directory of this sketch notice there are two JavaScript files I've moved the bubble Constructor function into a separate Javascript file if you missed the previous video about how to do that you can go back and watch that um and then I added a directory called images and I put three flowers in it cuz I like flowers uh flower zero flower 1 flower 2 and I very specifically name them with numbers for reason which I'll get to in a little bit but for right now let's just say this first pink flower I want all the images to look like that flower so uh you know this is I'm kind of glossing over a few details here but to load an image into P5 what you need is first a variable to refer to that image and then strangely enough I'm going to add another event here so this is a larger discussion about callbacks and the Order of things and the browser and how things work and I I want to have that convers in a few videos from now or really in the next video when I start talking about uh the P5 Dom library and how you can sort of start handling different kinds of events on the page but for right now a simple thing you can do is add this preload function which says in the preload function you want to load any media to make sure it's available for the sketch when it really starts in the setup function so the sketch starts in setup but now there's this like secret function that you can call before setup and this is really only for loading images loading sounds and later as you also see loading data files so if you're loading a spreadsheet or a big body of text that you're going to analyze and visualize you can also put those kind of things in preload so here I can say image equals load image and then in between quotes I need to put the path of the image the path relative to this particular project so again if I open up whoops the finder when you can see this is the project my images are in a directory called images not at all required but I'm doing that out of convenience is to not sort of like pollute the the root directory with a lot of additional files if I had 100 images would sort of be hard to look at so here I have a separate directory images and I can go back to the code and just write images SL flower z. jpeg so other thing I'm going to do I'm going to leave the background at zero so now I have that image variable and where am I displaying the bubbles in the display function so all I need to do is go into that display function and instead of drawing a circle draw that image so here I can say oops I left something in here by accident instead of drawing a circle I can comment that out and I can just say image image I should have called it flower or something this.x this.y so the image is drawn at the object's XY location instead of drawing a circle draw that image and the fill and stroke are no longer relevant I could tint the image and there's other ways to change the image but that's not really relevant to the discussion here so now if I run this you can see that every time I click I get a flower now there's two things to note here number one is I get this white border images are rectangles they are rectangles they are rectangles they have pixels and columns and rows they're a rectangle now if you if I had been better about this and made this flower image as a PNG file type with transparency then I could have those pixels around the edges of the flowers be transparent in this case I might kind of just use a kind of little bit bit of a trick here and say background 255 and you know now it kind of looks right now if I put two on top of each other you can see that that edge is still there I'll let you when you make your own flowers make better flowers than me but you can see this is kind important to think about as you're starting to work with images in your sketch the other thing I'll note here is notice where I click right here I'm going can't right here I'm going to click where's the image I clicked in the corner the image popped up in the corner so just like a rectangle has its reference point in the top left corner an image does also and in this case I would prefer the reference point to be the center I don't know why but I would just prefer that and so something you can do also with images just like you could do with rectangles is say image mode Center so image mode Center is a P5 function that now each time I click you can see an image comes up in the center so we've got this working through the use of a global variable so here in the main sketch I lo the image into that Global variable then I access the global variable in the object but this does not solve our problem the problem that we have is every time we click we want to see a different flower image how do we do that each bubble has its own image each bubble has its own image I'll say it one more time each bubble has if I say three times the code for it appears it doesn't do that but would be nice wouldn't it I should make a system that does that so but the reason why I'm saying each bubble has its own image the answer that you should be thinking is that means each bubble needs an image property it needs its own variable it needs its own variable to store an image so the bubble should store an image so I don't know what this should be equal to yet but this is the idea somehow the bubble gets its own image and the bubbles own this do image not the global variable image not one image for all bubbles but each bubble with its own image that's the big distinction here now of course the question is how do we fill that image so there's a bunch of different ways you could do this but I'm going to suggest a way that I think is rather nice for this particular scenario notice how the bubble gets its X and Y initialized by an AR a parameter that comes in function bubble XY that X is like a handoff variable it gets filled and it gets passed to this.x the Y gets filled gets passed to this. Y so what is what is the bubbles XY initialized in the code here Mouse X Mouse y so what I would like to do and I'm going to change this just to make things make a little more sense I'm going to call this flower so I have one flower image and what I do is when I make the bubble I want to send that flower image to the bubble make the bubble at Mouse X Mouse y with this flower image make the bubble at this mouse X Mouse y with the flower image so this is calling the Constructor Mouse X Mouse Y and flower go into bubble. JS right here x y and what now I need a third parameter image which fills the bubbles this. image now this is a little bit confusing like it's kind of like oh I don't know if I should be doing it this way I it's so convenient though like this is called XY image and this is called XY image there's a big huge difference though between thisx and plain old X plain old X is just a parameter for the Constructor function to receive a value and pass it to this.x this.x it's the real deal it's the variable for that object's Exposition so you could call these like temporary X or temporary y or handoff X or handoff Y but it's convenient actually just to call them XY image and they get they get filled and then they pass the that value into this.x this. y this that image this is really going to give you a headache and I apologize for this if I could make all of this just make instant sense I I absolutely would so maybe you have a better an idea for how to think about this but this is one of the more confusing things but if we take that now I think if you look at it this way we get three arguments Mouse X Mouse y flower image and those come into the object so now here we go I've got the same sketch but I have a much more flexible object I can initialize that bubble with different flower images and how might I initialize that bubble with different flower images how about I have an array so let's go oops let's go back back to here I never and the nice thing is I don't have to touch this code again the bubble is now a generic bubble that can display any image you pass to it so now I just need a way of passing different images to it right there not just this one Global flower but different ones so what I'm going to say is flowers equals brackets and I'm going to say flowers index0 is flowers Z flowers index one is flower one I need to change that and flowers index 2 is flowers two look at this one two so now you can see I'm loading three images into an array load flower zero into the zero zero spot one into the one spot two into the two spot now down here what could I do I could say flowers zero let's just be crazy and say flowers one and I run this and you can see look at that I'm getting the red flowers if I say flowers two oops I'm getting the yellow flowers and if I say flowers zero I'm getting the pink flowers flowers flowers everywhere flowers so all I need to do is vary that value instead of me hardcoding in zero or one or two every time I don't know I could pick a random value I could or I could cycle through them let's cycle through them I like that idea ah let's pick the random one so if I say VAR R equals random what's the range of random values I want the array has three elements in it indices 0 through two so I want a random value between between 0 and three better yet I want a random value between zero and the length of the array now I don't know that I've mentioned this in a previous video but random will give you a decimal value so I'm getting 0.457 or 2.3 61 I want to get rid of that decimal value and there's a function in P5 which is comes from JavaScript called floor this is a little bit of a digression but I think it's worth mentioning if I have the number three 3967 I could floor that number and it's going to give me the value three I could ceiling that number and it's going to give me the value four so floor always takes off the decimal point and goes down to three ceiling takes off the decimal point and goes up to the next number and there's also round which whether it's above 3.5 or below 3.5 it'll go to either three or four so these are kind of important little mathematical helper functions in this case I want the floor function CU I want this to be a random value in the array I don't want I only want to get 0o one or two so if I put the floor function in there and now I put R here oh I think I just finished this uh except for one step I can run this and every time I click I will get a different flower randomly right there's only three flowers in the array but a random one is passed into every object I have as many objects as I want and they'll all refer to one of those uh images in the AR array now there's one last piece of this that I could improve which is if you look at the way I did this preload is it's very hardcoded Right Flowers index zero flowers index one flowers index 2 it would be much nicer if I could say for VAR I equals 0 I is less than 3 I ++ flowers index I equals load image something now what's the something what's the something that I put there so so I know I have i counting 012 so somehow I need this text to be dynamic images flower zero images flower 1 images are to it's dynamic as the index in the array also want the text to be dynamic and there's a trick that you can use to do this so uh you probably are familiar with this statement 2 + 2 equals say it with me I know you're just watching somewhere by yourself maybe at the gym on a treadmill it's weird to just say the number four but say the number four I don't you probably not have the JY on a treadmill but somebody once said to me I watch your videos at the gy so that's why I said that uh okay so uh 2 + 2 equal 4 right we're all comfortable with that but if I have the text like cow plus Bell this equals cow bell so the plus with text with characters between quotes means concatenation or join so plus with numbers is addition plus with text is join so we can use that fact here with a trick I can say what do I want to make I want to say images slfl whoops come back to me plus I right I want to always start images flower and then I either want a zero one or two and I is a zero one or two and then what do I want after that plus uh jpeg so you can see this is the full string that I want flower a number and jpeg FL power plus a number plus. jpeg not add those things together join those things together so if I do that I don't need this anymore I can get rid of these three lines of code and here we go I can now click and add random flowers with different images now of course up here like this depends on that you name the files this way this only works because I name the files flower zero flower 1 flower two the nice thing is here is I if I had a th000 flower images I could put those all in the directory it would take a while to load 1 th images but it would work so this is something I think you can really play with in terms of how you can load a whole bunch of images pick them either in sequence or randomly I try the in sequence thing might be interesting and put them and use those objects to display an image so hopefully this was helpful to you one thing I would like to say at just the end of this video is I need to do a much better job of linking to like download the code that I'm doing in these examples if I reference a previous video I should have a link to that previous video in the description if you could help me with that I would be super appreciative of of it uh so um so you can actually just put in the comments like so first of all if you're typing the code along and you have it you can email it to me um but you just like say like the code for this is missing where can I find it or you know what you reference this video here's a link to that video If you give me those things I will just like remember to add them uh to videos so uh if you have a chance to help with that I would certainly appreciate it and the next set of videos I'm going to make is about how to add things to a P5 sketch that aren't just the canvas how can you add other types of elements that might appear on a web page a header a button a paragraph of text how do you manipulate those things with code so I'm super excited about that topic because it's kind of a new thing for me and I think it'll really expand the possibilities of what you can do with JavaScript and the browser np5 and all this stuff so I will hopefully get to making those videos soon and see you in this way that I see you I feel that I see you you are there to me uh sometime okay goodbye uh I have to stop I'm still here by the way I could just stay here right this video could just go on and on just stay here and but I'm not I'm going to stop okay goodbye
