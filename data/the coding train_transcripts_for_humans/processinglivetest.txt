With timestamps:

00:00 - i don't want to be able to hear you i
00:01 - need to turn that on
00:02 - [Music]
00:12 - this has to go here
00:14 - hello okay
00:16 - can you hear me
00:18 - yes hold on let me fix this camera
00:27 - can you hear me i can yes that's very
00:29 - exciting this totally works
00:33 - and can you see what i'm uh
00:35 - doing here in the white on the
00:36 - whiteboard
00:38 - yes
00:39 - hello
00:44 - um
00:46 - uh
00:46 - [Music]
00:48 - now i'm getting a loop
00:50 - what do you mean you're getting a loop
00:55 - the stream is behind but that doesn't
00:56 - matter
00:59 - um okay i'm looking for a marker
01:03 - um
01:04 - i guess actually maybe
01:07 - no
01:07 - it's a terrible idea
01:09 - i was trying okay wait i lost my marker
01:12 - oh there they are there they are
01:14 - okay
01:17 - everything's gonna be okay now
01:20 - did you witness the loop that i heard
01:23 - no i didn't there was no loop that i
01:26 - could
01:27 - notice
01:29 - all those times where you answered
01:31 - whether or not you could hear me you
01:33 - didn't hear those
01:35 - no because i only said that once
01:39 - are you
01:41 - or do you have the stream open in
01:43 - addition to the hangout or only the
01:45 - hangout
01:46 - [Music]
01:53 - i don't know if there's anybody watching
01:55 - i can juggle that why do you think that
01:56 - shawna this is actually a processing
01:59 - juggling show
02:02 - these are very hard to juggle
02:05 - these uh
02:06 - they don't flip and they don't like
02:08 - softly land in your hand
02:10 - um you can also probably balance one on
02:12 - my nose
02:16 - they can't never mind i was doing good
02:18 - though okay uh
02:21 - this works
02:23 - are you where are you are you just in
02:24 - the hallway yeah i'm just in the hole
02:26 - you want me to you want me to go
02:28 - somewhere quieter well i think i can
02:31 - hear your speakers
02:33 - no not yours i feel like my speakers are
02:36 - going into your microphone
02:39 - maybe not i thought i heard a little
02:40 - feedback
02:42 - i just want to make sure it's not a
02:44 - proximity thing
02:46 - i don't um
02:48 - i don't uh
02:51 - yeah i don't know how i could be giving
02:52 - you no you're probably right okay so i
02:55 - what i want to do here
02:58 - is check and see if there's anybody
03:04 - um
03:06 - all right so i don't know
03:09 - i don't see any way on the youtube thing
03:10 - to tell how many people are watching or
03:13 - if there's any way to
03:15 - there's no chat there's a leave a
03:17 - comment
03:19 - the youtube thing is behind so it's
03:20 - confusing for me to look at that
03:24 - it is behind
03:26 - twitter okay okay if you're watching
03:32 - uh
03:34 - post a ques a question about processing
03:38 - on twitter oh wait i see no there is
03:40 - somebody left to comment
03:47 - ask
03:48 - a question
03:58 - is this visible that would be like that
04:00 - would be the thing the other thing is
04:02 - i don't know how you can't there's no i
04:04 - have to invite you to the hangout
04:07 - but this works i could just actually do
04:09 - uh i have to record
04:12 - a list of videos to make just make one
04:14 - of them
04:15 - it's kind of funny it would be live
04:18 - uh but there's no i mean i need i need a
04:20 - like a wall of uh screens with faces or
04:23 - something
04:25 - yeah let's see i don't i doubt there's
04:26 - anybody really watching this
04:36 - all right so maybe we should maybe we
04:38 - need to find somebody on the itp floor
04:40 - who wants to like
04:41 - join in and ask is like working on
04:43 - something you could ask a question to
04:44 - try
04:45 - you want me to go look around i'll look
04:47 - around sure okay
04:50 - in the meantime i will recite lyrics
04:52 - from
04:53 - my name is
04:55 - no i can't pronounce um or
04:57 - i wish i had like interesting strange
04:59 - tricks i could do but juggling is about
05:02 - it i don't have anything good to juggle
05:10 - let's see here
05:21 - somebody leave a comment
05:25 - somebody did leave a comment people are
05:27 - watching
05:35 - nobody working on any processing stuff
05:52 - are you guys worth
05:53 - any manner or form
05:55 - what's that
05:56 - right now yes
05:58 - yes
06:03 - do you want to ask dan shiffman any
06:05 - questions
06:07 - he's doing live uh
06:10 - office hours
06:12 - throughout this or this is
06:14 - we're talking we're trying things out
06:15 - yeah yeah
06:17 - is that a google hangout it is a google
06:19 - hangout yeah
06:21 - um
06:22 - so how do we get them into the hangout i
06:24 - would have to know so what i need is the
06:28 - gmail that i can invite to the hangout
06:31 - you need to know their their google id
06:35 - yeah
06:36 - that's correct
06:38 - oh hello
06:40 - wait
06:41 - we're in the conference room hello
06:46 - okay let's hang out see what i really
06:48 - need is what i need is a monitor right
06:50 - here
06:51 - that has a hangout on it so i could look
06:54 - at it and talk to it because right now
06:56 - what i'm doing is i see the hangout over
06:58 - here
07:00 - so i'm going to pretend i'm just i can
07:02 - basically only hear you
07:06 - i only have audio at the moment
07:08 - so you can ask your question it has to
07:10 - be audio
07:13 - do you want to use my computer yeah we
07:15 - could just
07:16 - yeah so let me just launch process
07:22 - whatever you know what what else is a
07:24 - problem dan what
07:27 - is that when you type
07:29 - and you're on a hangout it mutes your
07:31 - audio
07:32 - seriously
07:35 - yeah
07:37 - [Applause]
07:39 - we
07:41 - are you able to hear us right now i can
07:42 - hear you yeah
07:44 - okay we can hear it okay are you able to
07:46 - see our screen
07:48 - uh if you do screen sharing and i walk
07:50 - over here
07:52 - i do have the hangout open
07:55 - so we can do this and he could see the
07:59 - processing sketch that's amazing
08:02 - so now you can see our processing sketch
08:04 - yeah
08:05 - right then you can see it yes i can
08:08 - can you scroll on oh oh just screenshot
08:10 - i see so it's whatever
08:14 - so if you wanted to
08:16 - ask him any processing questions like in
08:18 - this he could help out yeah
08:21 - so so
08:22 - in your experience like if you had some
08:25 - like if you run into difficulties you
08:27 - think it would be enough this would be
08:28 - enough or do you think he would need to
08:31 - be interacting with the sketch
08:34 - that would be
08:35 - you know good better if he can like if
08:38 - he could yeah
08:40 - dan show them what you can do here like
08:43 - what well here the thing is is i was
08:45 - imagining that maybe i might if i'm
08:47 - going to do one of these have people
08:48 - submit stuff in advance through dropbox
08:51 - so i would have sketch folders
08:53 - just ready to go
08:55 - over here
08:57 - that's so good do you like him like
08:59 - standing there and really
09:01 - we could
09:02 - look at that so you could um
09:04 - i mean i you know maybe you don't
09:06 - actually have anything but you you could
09:08 - like email something to me or stick it
09:10 - share dropbox with
09:12 - forget which account this is
09:14 - uh
09:17 - you can share to
09:27 - if you share anything via dropbox to
09:31 - videos and shiffman.net
09:34 - then i can get it instantly
09:37 - uh over here so
09:41 - yeah
09:42 - oh yeah i did i just hit the button
09:44 - share via dropbox
09:46 - this is great
09:48 - videos how long did they let you do
09:50 - these
09:50 - uh hangouts on here i think you can go
09:53 - forever
09:55 - forever forever and ever can i get a
09:58 - little chamber pot put over here and
10:00 - then exactly
10:02 - well actually we'll get you a feeding
10:03 - tube and a catheter
10:06 - very awkward
10:09 - okay
10:10 - so this is how you can share anybody
10:12 - watching
10:13 - all
10:14 - maybe one of you watching
10:17 - um you could
10:19 - tweet a question or share processing
10:21 - sketches
10:23 - to videos
10:25 - let's see let's see oh
10:28 - let's see what's happening on twitter
10:32 - uh
10:34 - richard gill says i don't have a
10:36 - question but i am watching hello
10:52 - [Music]
10:53 - and how many ways
11:00 - yeah how often
11:19 - let's see this is what i see
11:23 - this is very meta
11:29 - it's strange the when you have the
11:30 - screen sharing up it's a little
11:31 - disconcerting because it feels like
11:33 - nobody's there
11:37 - there we go there's me
11:40 - um
11:42 - how do i find the dropbox how do i find
11:44 - your dropbox
11:47 - videos
11:50 - so i have to go to the dropbox
12:01 - any other tweets dan
12:05 - let's see uh
12:10 - yes good question hi
12:12 - sean van every from
12:14 - um
12:15 - wichita kansas writes in and says
12:18 - is that even a place i don't know um oh
12:20 - yeah can you see me oh yeah says how
12:23 - often will you do this okay so this is
12:25 - just a test
12:26 - clearly we're completely disorganized
12:29 - i don't really know what we're doing but
12:30 - um
12:31 - my plan is starting in the fall starting
12:33 - in september we will do this at a
12:35 - specific time once per week
12:38 - uh or at least every other week
12:40 - um and that there will be a time by
12:42 - which you can submit questions so that
12:44 - maybe on an email box or something where
12:46 - you could submit questions in advance
12:48 - and then i will pick a few and we'll do
12:50 - like an hour an hour kind of thing where
12:53 - you know do like uh four questions 15
12:56 - minutes each or something
12:58 - it'll be awesome it'll be music and
13:00 - dancing except without the music and
13:02 - dancing
13:05 - oh okay somebody else writes in
13:08 - ah okay look oh my goodness
13:11 - this is a very hard question okay i got
13:13 - a question is there a processing library
13:16 - for quad tree
13:19 - detection
13:20 - um
13:22 - not that i know
13:24 - um so um
13:26 - you know if you use so you might be
13:29 - wondering
13:30 - not the person who asked the question
13:31 - probably because they presumably know
13:33 - what quad tree collision detection is i
13:34 - i don't really but i have a big idea in
13:36 - my mind but essentially we you have this
13:39 - problem when you're working on a sketch
13:41 - that has lots of things in it
13:45 - let's say you have this sketch
13:48 - and it has lots of objects in it let's
13:50 - say each object has to check if it's
13:52 - colliding with another object and if you
13:54 - just have two of them each object you
13:57 - know object
13:58 - a has to check well hey that's a bad
14:00 - example let's say let's say you have
14:01 - three
14:02 - you have a b and c object a has to check
14:05 - against a b and c
14:07 - object b has to check against a b and c
14:10 - and object c has to check against a b
14:12 - and c
14:14 - okay so if you have three things this is
14:16 - one two three four five six seven eight
14:18 - nine three times three is nine this is
14:21 - an n squared algorithm meaning the
14:23 - number of elements that you have to do
14:25 - collision detection you need to need to
14:27 - do that number square so if you have
14:31 - three you've got to do nine so let's
14:33 - look at it this way by the way if you
14:34 - have zero
14:36 - if you have 10 you have to do 100. if
14:39 - you have 100
14:42 - you have to do ten thousand if you have
14:44 - one thousand you have to do
14:48 - i'll do one million um
14:51 - one billion
14:54 - thank you for pretending to laugh but
14:56 - one person who's watching this this is
14:58 - great i'm watching okay so um there's
15:02 - three of us in here watching oh three
15:04 - excellent and possibly a four or five
15:06 - okay so if you notice we just went up by
15:08 - a factor of 10 but
15:13 - we're going up by a factor of a hund of
15:15 - of a hundred so
15:17 - we're we're getting these mass amounts
15:18 - this and this becomes incredibly
15:19 - incredibly slow this is the problem i
15:21 - forgot where once you have a lot of
15:23 - things on the screen to check if they're
15:24 - colliding becomes incredibly slow so
15:26 - there are all sorts of fancy ways of
15:29 - figuring out how you could say like oh
15:31 - we could divide the screen into cells
15:34 - and we could maybe have just these
15:36 - objects check against other objects in
15:37 - their cells that's called bin ladies
15:39 - spatial subdivision and in fact
15:43 - if you're looking for an example of that
15:46 - look no farther than
15:54 - chapter six i believe
15:58 - um
15:59 - so this in the nature of code which is
16:01 - natureofcode.com
16:03 - in chapter six
16:06 - uh i think
16:09 - uh in 6 15 i kind of go i kind of go
16:12 - through and describe
16:14 - at least how to do sorry i lost where
16:15 - this was
16:21 - huh oh here it is
16:23 - so i kind of walk through this example
16:25 - of how to do
16:26 - uh bin lad spatial subdivision in the
16:28 - context of a flocking example and i
16:31 - think that i have
16:33 - do i have on this machine it would be
16:35 - sad if i didn't i do all the nature of
16:37 - code examples i will just demonstrate
16:39 - this for you very briefly by the way we
16:41 - haven't talked anything about quad three
16:42 - but
16:43 - you know kind of on the way there maybe
16:45 - i'll
16:45 - you know i'm kind of avoiding that
16:46 - sounds like a very complicated topic
16:48 - that i would possibly understand so
16:49 - we'll mention that in a second um okay
16:51 - so i go to chapter six
16:54 - and
16:55 - the example i'm looking for is bin
16:56 - ladies spatial subdivision
16:59 - let me just run
17:01 - this example in processing very briefly
17:04 - so here is
17:05 - a
17:06 - sketch now on google hangout you
17:08 - probably can't really notice that the
17:11 - animation is very slow but you can see
17:13 - this over here frame rate
17:16 - 12 12 frames per second this is 2 000
17:19 - objects each determining if they're
17:21 - touching another object they turn white
17:23 - if they're not they turn green it's only
17:24 - running at 12 frames per second very
17:26 - very slow that's with no bin lattice
17:29 - spatial subdivision
17:31 - with bin laden spatial subdivision
17:33 - subdivision which apparently i can't say
17:35 - we can see now that we're getting a nice
17:37 - frame rate of like 45 frames per second
17:39 - exactly the same
17:41 - but it's much faster so
17:44 - um uh what was i saying so you know i
17:47 - didn't actually go through the details
17:48 - of how bin ladies space tools
17:50 - subdivision works because
17:52 - i have no idea what i'm doing some weird
17:54 - live google hangout rambling thing but
17:56 - um
17:58 - but it's essentially an algorithm that
18:00 - just allows you to subdivide your window
18:02 - into different cells all of equal within
18:05 - height so there are fancier things like
18:07 - quadtree which allow you to be more what
18:10 - you know what if suddenly all of the in
18:12 - a flocking simulation all the voids are
18:14 - suddenly in the bottom right hand corner
18:16 - of the window you're going to have to do
18:18 - something more sophisticated to be able
18:19 - to get any type of optimal collision
18:21 - detection but the question was asked is
18:23 - there a library for quad 3 something
18:26 - around collision section
18:28 - but i'm pretty sure that box 2d which
18:30 - you can use in processing
18:32 - employs
18:33 - uh if not quadri something similar to
18:36 - optimize its collision detection because
18:38 - it's certainly not doing those um
18:41 - i i would i would almost be i'm almost
18:43 - certain that it's not doing a kind of
18:44 - raw brute force collision detection
18:46 - thing
18:47 - okay yeah is that raw brute force way
18:49 - that you described in the beginning the
18:51 - n squared one yes
18:54 - is that actually the brute force way or
18:56 - would you say
18:57 - is eight is a touching b and c oh i
19:00 - gotta i gotta run for a minute
19:06 - asking how do we get ending okay let's
19:08 - see we have some more uh maybe some more
19:11 - questions that are being asked on
19:12 - twitter
19:13 - oh
19:14 - no just somebody retweeted that this was
19:16 - happening
19:18 - hey dan i actually have to hop off okay
19:27 - okay bye bye guys i'm gonna um
19:30 - hang out here for a little bit longer if
19:32 - anybody wants to ask a question
19:34 - but how do we get into the hangout yeah
19:36 - so can you send can you tweet at dan
19:39 - your your google
19:41 - i guess you'd have to direct message me
19:43 - if you don't want it to be in public but
19:44 - i need
19:45 - to join hang out
19:49 - where
19:51 - twitter just dm him google you can also
19:54 - just email it to me or email him your
19:57 - group your google app email and then
19:59 - he'll invite you to hang out
20:02 - i guess i'll
20:03 - email me
20:08 - hello
20:09 - good how are you
20:20 - uh let's see here
20:25 - somebody shout let's see
20:34 - i heard somebody at the door
20:37 - uh
20:39 - okay let's see i think i'm getting a
20:41 - message i need another little podium
20:43 - here
20:45 - no
20:46 - no messages
20:50 - ah
20:52 - oh somebody sent a sketch
20:56 - okay um
20:58 - oh no i need it wasn't it was emailed to
21:00 - me so i got an email actually which with
21:04 - a sketch here but it wasn't sent via
21:05 - dropbox so i have to um
21:08 - uh let me see if i can get it let me see
21:10 - if i can pull it open
21:13 - i really don't want to log in oh the
21:15 - camera cut out hold on everybody
21:23 - hello okay so uh somebody sent me an
21:25 - email i'm gonna have to share it via
21:27 - dropbox myself
21:29 - because i uh i don't want to log into my
21:32 - email on a
21:33 - live stream but people send me lots of
21:36 - very private and touching beautiful
21:38 - messages that i know they wouldn't want
21:40 - to
21:41 - see it online okay um ship share
21:45 - dropbox
21:48 - sorry everyone
21:52 - i'll have this in a moment
21:58 - i don't know how what do you what do
21:59 - people like on the radio there's you're
22:01 - not ever supposed to have silence is
22:03 - this kind of like the radio dropbox
22:05 - share
22:06 - uh share this folder
22:12 - with uh videos at shiftmoon.net
22:19 - okay so this is coming in from
22:25 - this is coming in from
22:30 - from joel
22:31 - uh matthew i don't know maybe i'm not
22:33 - supposed to say people's names i don't
22:34 - know it's quick okay uh let's see if i
22:37 - can get this sketch now that was sent to
22:38 - me uh
22:41 - dropbox ah invited to share except
22:55 - hit accept right
22:58 - let's go to dropbox folder there it is
23:01 - here it is okay
23:03 - so let's look at this um so we've got a
23:05 - nice little sketch here i think the
23:07 - files are still coming in
23:09 - still downloading so we'll wait so let's
23:11 - look at the question um i test a ball
23:14 - the question says i'm reading i test the
23:16 - ball for collision
23:18 - the the text collision is 95 of the time
23:20 - but occasionally the ball
23:22 - falls right through
23:24 - so
23:25 - i'm not sure if it's a um
23:28 - voice it's really slow
23:30 - it's not in yet i'm not sure if this is
23:33 - a ball versus ball collision or a ball
23:37 - versus wall collision but
23:39 - i wonder we're gonna look at the sketch
23:41 - in a second but if you have a sketch
23:43 - where you have this ball and you're
23:45 - testing right if this is like the bottom
23:47 - of the screen
23:48 - height maybe you have an if statement
23:51 - where you say if y is greater than
23:53 - height
23:56 - maybe you're testing if the ball goes
23:58 - past
23:59 - this part then you're going to do
24:01 - something like hey maybe there's a
24:02 - variable called y speed which is telling
24:05 - us how the ball is moving down and
24:07 - you're saying y speed equals y speed
24:09 - times negative one this we're going to
24:12 - see if the code is actually related to
24:13 - this question but this
24:17 - is potentially a problem why is this a
24:20 - problem you know we don't really know
24:22 - different things could be happening
24:24 - you know you can seems like an exact
24:26 - science but uh we could have a situation
24:28 - where the ball goes past the height
24:31 - it turns around
24:33 - but it doesn't actually make it all the
24:35 - way back it turns around and just goes
24:37 - to here
24:38 - and then what's that problem it's still
24:40 - below height so this would still be true
24:42 - and it would tell it to go back down so
24:44 - you can often get these scenarios where
24:45 - something is stuck
24:47 - below the surface now there's nobody
24:49 - there's nobody to talk back to me
24:52 - because i don't know nobody's on the
24:53 - hangout right now but um
24:55 - but there's a nice solution to this
24:57 - which is what we could often do is just
24:59 - set y directly to height so that if the
25:03 - ball goes down in addition to setting it
25:05 - back we also sneak its location right
25:07 - back there so we kind of like nudge it
25:09 - back onto the screen but let's see let
25:11 - me try to go back to the sketch
25:14 - which is now downloaded
25:16 - um okay so one thing that's interesting
25:18 - about this is i'm getting ah here we go
25:24 - javascript
25:27 - intersect whoa
25:29 - okay so this is going to be a big
25:32 - so this is not we're going to run this
25:34 - and maybe we'll see that there's a
25:35 - problem but this is probably going to be
25:37 - much too this is a large sketch than
25:39 - about kind of having looked at it
25:40 - uh and there's already some other
25:43 - stuff
25:45 - going on audio stuff so i'm gonna i
25:47 - guess i'm gonna have to unfortunately
25:49 - speak more generally or less
25:52 - uh
25:53 - uh unless um
25:55 - whoever sent this in wants to try to ask
25:57 - a more specific question about the
25:59 - scenario but right now i don't want to
26:01 - uh
26:03 - because i could like sign off and debug
26:05 - and sign back on okay wait i got a
26:07 - message here uh
26:09 - no link
26:11 - you you just have to share
26:14 - with videos
26:18 - okay um now let's see what's happening
26:20 - on twitter
26:22 - thank you for doing this live stream
26:23 - it's quite interesting
26:25 - uh
26:27 - we will hang out with okay um
26:31 - so if you want to maybe i'm gonna check
26:33 - my email maybe somebody emailed me oh
26:36 - you can't see me right now hurry up
26:38 - maybe somebody emailed me
26:40 - to get invited to the hangout
26:52 - okay wait uh i've got somebody who maybe
26:54 - wants to join i'm going to try to invite
26:56 - them
27:02 - let's see if i can do this
27:06 - um i really don't like where this podium
27:08 - is but i have to work on this later okay
27:11 - invite invite
27:13 - interestingly enough unless you're the
27:15 - original creator of the hangout
27:18 - you cannot invite someone
27:23 - so let me see if
27:26 - you can invite
27:34 - yes
28:00 - hello
28:15 - all right we have somebody
28:16 - yeah that's me hi dan this is dave
28:18 - pentecost hi nice to see you virtually
28:21 - almost in person the other day but now
28:23 - virtually
28:25 - this is great uh running the screen
28:28 - behind you that's a nice trick
28:30 - thank you
28:33 - um okay so what's going on what's
28:34 - happening today in uh
28:37 - processing land
28:39 - uh well uh andres was around all weekend
28:44 - uh are actually saturday evening to uh
28:49 - what's that
28:51 - i think um
28:52 - you might have the stream open in a
28:54 - different window
28:56 - yeah i do hold on
28:59 - all right we have somebody
29:02 - it's kind of like in the old days when
29:04 - they said turn your radio down
29:07 - okay i've stopped it in another window
29:10 - can you
29:10 - can you see me or am i screwing things
29:13 - up here no no you're absolutely fine i
29:15 - actually can't see you but i can hear
29:16 - you
29:17 - i can't see you if i look over here so
29:19 - now i can see you
29:20 - okay i'm standing over here in this
29:22 - direction i don't see anyone okay well
29:24 - but now i don't see you on the oh right
29:29 - there we go
29:31 - yep
29:35 - so uh so andres was here
29:38 - can you hear me yeah yeah
29:40 - yeah so andres was here and um
29:44 - uh he struggled a bit with this uh with
29:47 - this hemispheric projection it turns out
29:50 - the fisheye that's in version two
29:53 - is not the right thing it's not the
29:55 - right fisheye for the dome
29:57 - uh he came to a conclusion that it's a
30:00 - lot more complicated than he expected
30:03 - and
30:04 - he started working with
30:07 - a different approach well we know that
30:08 - there's a 1.5 version somebody else came
30:11 - up with
30:12 - and
30:14 - that we can use with some of the samples
30:16 - including some of uh
30:19 - robert hodgins
30:21 - things we could try that with that but
30:23 - for the 2.0 stuff he's still struggling
30:28 - with your camera yeah camera goes off
30:30 - every 30 minutes
30:32 - okay um so let me know i don't know that
30:35 - anybody else is actually watching this
30:36 - but just um also because i have some
30:38 - questions just this might be just an
30:40 - interesting brief discussion that we can
30:41 - have so you uh have a
30:44 - uh planetarium dome
30:46 - so it's uh
30:48 - and is it just a single projector or
30:50 - what's the kind of a single computer
30:53 - what's the setup
30:54 - yeah okay so it's a single fisheye
30:57 - projector i wanted to wanted to make it
30:59 - as simple as possible for anybody
31:02 - like you or andres or anybody any other
31:04 - visualizers to come in and
31:07 - uh plug in and immediately put things up
31:10 - there but the coolest thing
31:12 - of course would be if we can frame any
31:15 - of the processing sketches with
31:17 - a fisheye view so it uh it looks in
31:21 - perspective we can have things floating
31:22 - around us in the dawn
31:24 - right so if you just took a regular
31:27 - processing sketch
31:28 - put it through the projector and
31:29 - projected it would look distorted is
31:31 - that what's happening without right if
31:34 - if it's um
31:36 - yeah you see a distorted rectangle
31:38 - depending on the size of uh of the
31:40 - sketch you'll see a distorted rectangle
31:42 - we can do that we can throw it up there
31:45 - right um and
31:46 - but if it's in a circle that's 1200 by
31:50 - 1200 pixels 1200 diameter
31:53 - then it can fill the dome
31:56 - if it's a radial sketch it might look
31:58 - cool in the dome but if it's a 3d sketch
32:01 - we've got to impose this
32:04 - this
32:05 - hemispheric projection on it for it to
32:08 - look in perspective so it ideally should
32:10 - be a
32:12 - circular and 1200 pixels in diameter
32:14 - right our our projector actually is uh
32:18 - goes up to 1600 pixels but right now we
32:21 - have
32:22 - the windows computer that's running the
32:25 - astronomy software
32:26 - in uh
32:28 - dueling dvi at 1600 and i'm in an hdmi
32:33 - input which only goes up to 1200. so
32:35 - 1200 is pretty i mean the 1200 is
32:38 - manageable for computing purposes and
32:41 - it's pretty simple anybody can come in
32:43 - and plug in
32:45 - i wonder if even just using something
32:47 - like mad mapper would somehow have like
32:50 - a
32:51 - it could take like a little simple 3d
32:53 - model of
32:54 - the dough and then uh
32:58 - the process well the problem is
33:01 - yeah the problem is
33:02 - you really have to simulate a 180 degree
33:06 - fisheye lens
33:08 - right so
33:11 - you need to create you need to do it
33:13 - with a uh you know one of these cubic
33:15 - projections that are actually like
33:18 - having a bunch of cameras that you then
33:20 - shoot the results from and project up
33:22 - there
33:24 - interesting well the good news is
33:26 - if there's anybody well suited to figure
33:27 - this out his name is andres
33:31 - yeah that's what i thought too but he
33:33 - was pretty stumped last night he left a
33:35 - little dejected but he's determined
33:38 - um so i look forward to having a chance
33:41 - to come look at it too
33:44 - right yeah it's it's pretty fun as i say
33:46 - you know almost anything projected up in
33:48 - the dome looks cool
33:50 - it's coolest if it
33:52 - if it's up there in proper perspective
33:54 - if you're a stickler about that
33:56 - right
33:58 - uh and also since you're going to be
34:00 - doing these this unit with your students
34:03 - about
34:04 - projecting space which looks very cool
34:07 - um
34:08 - this you know i i mean
34:11 - projecting space on a flat screen that's
34:13 - how we look at everything
34:15 - everywhere else besides the planetarium
34:17 - but they might find it uh interesting to
34:20 - see it actually surrounding them so yeah
34:23 - it would be perfect i mean my
34:25 - kind of idea would be to have
34:28 - some basic examples that show how to
34:30 - make a sketch that would run
34:32 - there and let the students play with it
34:33 - and then actually go over and try them
34:35 - out
34:36 - right it's gonna be once uh andres has
34:39 - the
34:40 - the uh
34:42 - the bugs worked out on this it's gonna
34:44 - be a pretty simple matter to drop your
34:46 - sketch into a draw scene
34:49 - uh area in his fisheye
34:52 - met up right awesome so that'll be
34:55 - that'll be fun and i think you'll find
34:57 - it interesting i want to i want to
34:59 - connect you as i i said in the email i
35:02 - think i want to connect you with uh
35:04 - carter emmerd
35:05 - who has kind of spearheaded this
35:07 - radicalization do you know carter uh yes
35:10 - i've met him before he came here at itp
35:12 - to give a presentation okay so you know
35:14 - you know what he's done yeah yeah
35:16 - and uh so a lot i i read robert hodgins
35:20 - um uh post about going going trying to
35:24 - figure out how to deal with the
35:26 - distances and the sizes of uh
35:29 - of the astronomical objects and
35:32 - presumably carter and his uh ex-students
35:35 - have wrestled with this and come up with
35:37 - this solution so you can you can see
35:39 - what you think when you see that working
35:41 - too awesome
35:44 - so now i've now i've hijacked your
35:47 - information here no no there's no so
35:50 - this is just actually a test we are just
35:52 - trying to test to see if this system
35:54 - here in this room which i've been using
35:56 - to record
35:57 - stuff could also be broadcast live
36:00 - and the things that the thing that i've
36:02 - discovered is you google hangouts which
36:04 - you can broadcast
36:05 - um people can't just add themselves they
36:08 - have to be invited so i need a system
36:10 - by which i either have people in advance
36:12 - or that they can um as well as sort of
36:15 - hard to kind of manage and figure out
36:17 - like if people can ask a question or
36:19 - whatever but i i i thank you for
36:22 - calling in
36:23 - because that was really helpful to kind
36:25 - of test this and i'm gonna just kind of
36:27 - see if there are any other
36:28 - uh twitter messages or emails of other
36:30 - people who might want to ask a question
36:31 - or try and i'm probably
36:32 - oh it's 4 15 i'll probably turn this i
36:35 - have to go soon so i'll probably turn
36:36 - this off
36:37 - okay you better better get on to your
36:39 - other customers
36:41 - i did have one more question
36:43 - how do you do the superimposition of you
36:46 - on the screen have you got a little
36:47 - device there
36:49 - so um
36:50 - this has actually been done so you're
36:52 - referring to the fact that yeah yeah so
36:55 - um the good news is i'm going to we've
36:57 - made a documentation video about how all
36:59 - of this stuff works in this room which i
37:01 - just need to post which will explain it
37:04 - with more detail but the short answer is
37:06 - um there is a camera and a laptop and
37:10 - both the feed from the camera which is
37:12 - recording me excuse me in the feed from
37:13 - the laptop which is you're seeing here
37:15 - both go into one machine as capture
37:18 - devices and software called wirecast
37:20 - is uh compositing them and this is just
37:22 - a green screen so right here is a green
37:24 - screen which you can actually see i
37:26 - think i'm in the hangout right right i
37:29 - figured it was a green you can see this
37:31 - is there's the actual laptop
37:33 - yep this is just a green screen and uh
37:37 - they're being if this is obviously the
37:39 - non-composited view
37:41 - uh there and then this is the composite
37:43 - view
37:44 - yep
37:45 - thank you awesome thanks for calling and
37:47 - i'll be in touch over email okay okay
37:54 - all right let's see
37:55 - um okay so let's see what else oh i'm in
37:58 - the wrong place here
38:00 - um
38:01 - i guess i'm going to i feel like i
38:04 - should have a song or something to
38:06 - finish off with let's see either no
38:08 - other twitter messages
38:13 - there are there's a youtube comment that
38:15 - says hi
38:18 - and i don't have any emails
38:20 - so um i think actually it's 4 15 this
38:23 - was a good test
38:25 - if you like this
38:26 - maybe we'll do it again
38:28 - um
38:29 - i don't know what's a nice song uh to
38:32 - finish
38:33 - off with uh we were testing uh audio
38:36 - with fanfare from the cop for the common
38:38 - man of course they're gonna make us
38:39 - watch an ad
38:41 - hey it's interesting because i can't
38:42 - tell it's just like think this ad
38:57 - thank you everyone for tuning in if um i
39:00 - don't know that i'll do another test uh
39:03 - i don't know that i will do another test
39:04 - this summer uh but i will i might do one
39:08 - more test this summer uh but the we're
39:11 - going to kind of organize this a bit
39:13 - more and try to make this a weekly event
39:15 - where you could
39:16 - possibly ask questions over twitter
39:18 - maybe maybe you could join the hangout
39:20 - to actually be here and ask questions i
39:22 - don't know if anyone's watching um
39:24 - but i guess this gets recorded so um and
39:28 - maybe some way of like sharing sketches
39:29 - through dropbox so if you have ideas uh
39:32 - for how this might work better or if you
39:33 - have a question
39:34 - you want to ask for like again i
39:36 - probably do this till september you can
39:37 - send me an email
39:40 - um know with your sketch attached so i'm
39:43 - gonna figure out how to turn this off
39:45 - which i think i have to go to this
39:46 - computer
39:48 - and click end the broadcast i'm gonna
39:51 - click end broadcast i think the hangout
39:52 - will still be here
39:54 - but the broadcast will open

Cleaned transcript:

i don't want to be able to hear you i need to turn that on this has to go here hello okay can you hear me yes hold on let me fix this camera can you hear me i can yes that's very exciting this totally works and can you see what i'm uh doing here in the white on the whiteboard yes hello um uh now i'm getting a loop what do you mean you're getting a loop the stream is behind but that doesn't matter um okay i'm looking for a marker um i guess actually maybe no it's a terrible idea i was trying okay wait i lost my marker oh there they are there they are okay everything's gonna be okay now did you witness the loop that i heard no i didn't there was no loop that i could notice all those times where you answered whether or not you could hear me you didn't hear those no because i only said that once are you or do you have the stream open in addition to the hangout or only the hangout i don't know if there's anybody watching i can juggle that why do you think that shawna this is actually a processing juggling show these are very hard to juggle these uh they don't flip and they don't like softly land in your hand um you can also probably balance one on my nose they can't never mind i was doing good though okay uh this works are you where are you are you just in the hallway yeah i'm just in the hole you want me to you want me to go somewhere quieter well i think i can hear your speakers no not yours i feel like my speakers are going into your microphone maybe not i thought i heard a little feedback i just want to make sure it's not a proximity thing i don't um i don't uh yeah i don't know how i could be giving you no you're probably right okay so i what i want to do here is check and see if there's anybody um all right so i don't know i don't see any way on the youtube thing to tell how many people are watching or if there's any way to there's no chat there's a leave a comment the youtube thing is behind so it's confusing for me to look at that it is behind twitter okay okay if you're watching uh post a ques a question about processing on twitter oh wait i see no there is somebody left to comment ask a question is this visible that would be like that would be the thing the other thing is i don't know how you can't there's no i have to invite you to the hangout but this works i could just actually do uh i have to record a list of videos to make just make one of them it's kind of funny it would be live uh but there's no i mean i need i need a like a wall of uh screens with faces or something yeah let's see i don't i doubt there's anybody really watching this all right so maybe we should maybe we need to find somebody on the itp floor who wants to like join in and ask is like working on something you could ask a question to try you want me to go look around i'll look around sure okay in the meantime i will recite lyrics from my name is no i can't pronounce um or i wish i had like interesting strange tricks i could do but juggling is about it i don't have anything good to juggle let's see here somebody leave a comment somebody did leave a comment people are watching nobody working on any processing stuff are you guys worth any manner or form what's that right now yes yes do you want to ask dan shiffman any questions he's doing live uh office hours throughout this or this is we're talking we're trying things out yeah yeah is that a google hangout it is a google hangout yeah um so how do we get them into the hangout i would have to know so what i need is the gmail that i can invite to the hangout you need to know their their google id yeah that's correct oh hello wait we're in the conference room hello okay let's hang out see what i really need is what i need is a monitor right here that has a hangout on it so i could look at it and talk to it because right now what i'm doing is i see the hangout over here so i'm going to pretend i'm just i can basically only hear you i only have audio at the moment so you can ask your question it has to be audio do you want to use my computer yeah we could just yeah so let me just launch process whatever you know what what else is a problem dan what is that when you type and you're on a hangout it mutes your audio seriously yeah we are you able to hear us right now i can hear you yeah okay we can hear it okay are you able to see our screen uh if you do screen sharing and i walk over here i do have the hangout open so we can do this and he could see the processing sketch that's amazing so now you can see our processing sketch yeah right then you can see it yes i can can you scroll on oh oh just screenshot i see so it's whatever so if you wanted to ask him any processing questions like in this he could help out yeah so so in your experience like if you had some like if you run into difficulties you think it would be enough this would be enough or do you think he would need to be interacting with the sketch that would be you know good better if he can like if he could yeah dan show them what you can do here like what well here the thing is is i was imagining that maybe i might if i'm going to do one of these have people submit stuff in advance through dropbox so i would have sketch folders just ready to go over here that's so good do you like him like standing there and really we could look at that so you could um i mean i you know maybe you don't actually have anything but you you could like email something to me or stick it share dropbox with forget which account this is uh you can share to if you share anything via dropbox to videos and shiffman.net then i can get it instantly uh over here so yeah oh yeah i did i just hit the button share via dropbox this is great videos how long did they let you do these uh hangouts on here i think you can go forever forever forever and ever can i get a little chamber pot put over here and then exactly well actually we'll get you a feeding tube and a catheter very awkward okay so this is how you can share anybody watching all maybe one of you watching um you could tweet a question or share processing sketches to videos let's see let's see oh let's see what's happening on twitter uh richard gill says i don't have a question but i am watching hello and how many ways yeah how often let's see this is what i see this is very meta it's strange the when you have the screen sharing up it's a little disconcerting because it feels like nobody's there there we go there's me um how do i find the dropbox how do i find your dropbox videos so i have to go to the dropbox any other tweets dan let's see uh yes good question hi sean van every from um wichita kansas writes in and says is that even a place i don't know um oh yeah can you see me oh yeah says how often will you do this okay so this is just a test clearly we're completely disorganized i don't really know what we're doing but um my plan is starting in the fall starting in september we will do this at a specific time once per week uh or at least every other week um and that there will be a time by which you can submit questions so that maybe on an email box or something where you could submit questions in advance and then i will pick a few and we'll do like an hour an hour kind of thing where you know do like uh four questions 15 minutes each or something it'll be awesome it'll be music and dancing except without the music and dancing oh okay somebody else writes in ah okay look oh my goodness this is a very hard question okay i got a question is there a processing library for quad tree detection um not that i know um so um you know if you use so you might be wondering not the person who asked the question probably because they presumably know what quad tree collision detection is i i don't really but i have a big idea in my mind but essentially we you have this problem when you're working on a sketch that has lots of things in it let's say you have this sketch and it has lots of objects in it let's say each object has to check if it's colliding with another object and if you just have two of them each object you know object a has to check well hey that's a bad example let's say let's say you have three you have a b and c object a has to check against a b and c object b has to check against a b and c and object c has to check against a b and c okay so if you have three things this is one two three four five six seven eight nine three times three is nine this is an n squared algorithm meaning the number of elements that you have to do collision detection you need to need to do that number square so if you have three you've got to do nine so let's look at it this way by the way if you have zero if you have 10 you have to do 100. if you have 100 you have to do ten thousand if you have one thousand you have to do i'll do one million um one billion thank you for pretending to laugh but one person who's watching this this is great i'm watching okay so um there's three of us in here watching oh three excellent and possibly a four or five okay so if you notice we just went up by a factor of 10 but we're going up by a factor of a hund of of a hundred so we're we're getting these mass amounts this and this becomes incredibly incredibly slow this is the problem i forgot where once you have a lot of things on the screen to check if they're colliding becomes incredibly slow so there are all sorts of fancy ways of figuring out how you could say like oh we could divide the screen into cells and we could maybe have just these objects check against other objects in their cells that's called bin ladies spatial subdivision and in fact if you're looking for an example of that look no farther than chapter six i believe um so this in the nature of code which is natureofcode.com in chapter six uh i think uh in 6 15 i kind of go i kind of go through and describe at least how to do sorry i lost where this was huh oh here it is so i kind of walk through this example of how to do uh bin lad spatial subdivision in the context of a flocking example and i think that i have do i have on this machine it would be sad if i didn't i do all the nature of code examples i will just demonstrate this for you very briefly by the way we haven't talked anything about quad three but you know kind of on the way there maybe i'll you know i'm kind of avoiding that sounds like a very complicated topic that i would possibly understand so we'll mention that in a second um okay so i go to chapter six and the example i'm looking for is bin ladies spatial subdivision let me just run this example in processing very briefly so here is a sketch now on google hangout you probably can't really notice that the animation is very slow but you can see this over here frame rate 12 12 frames per second this is 2 000 objects each determining if they're touching another object they turn white if they're not they turn green it's only running at 12 frames per second very very slow that's with no bin lattice spatial subdivision with bin laden spatial subdivision subdivision which apparently i can't say we can see now that we're getting a nice frame rate of like 45 frames per second exactly the same but it's much faster so um uh what was i saying so you know i didn't actually go through the details of how bin ladies space tools subdivision works because i have no idea what i'm doing some weird live google hangout rambling thing but um but it's essentially an algorithm that just allows you to subdivide your window into different cells all of equal within height so there are fancier things like quadtree which allow you to be more what you know what if suddenly all of the in a flocking simulation all the voids are suddenly in the bottom right hand corner of the window you're going to have to do something more sophisticated to be able to get any type of optimal collision detection but the question was asked is there a library for quad 3 something around collision section but i'm pretty sure that box 2d which you can use in processing employs uh if not quadri something similar to optimize its collision detection because it's certainly not doing those um i i would i would almost be i'm almost certain that it's not doing a kind of raw brute force collision detection thing okay yeah is that raw brute force way that you described in the beginning the n squared one yes is that actually the brute force way or would you say is eight is a touching b and c oh i gotta i gotta run for a minute asking how do we get ending okay let's see we have some more uh maybe some more questions that are being asked on twitter oh no just somebody retweeted that this was happening hey dan i actually have to hop off okay okay bye bye guys i'm gonna um hang out here for a little bit longer if anybody wants to ask a question but how do we get into the hangout yeah so can you send can you tweet at dan your your google i guess you'd have to direct message me if you don't want it to be in public but i need to join hang out where twitter just dm him google you can also just email it to me or email him your group your google app email and then he'll invite you to hang out i guess i'll email me hello good how are you uh let's see here somebody shout let's see i heard somebody at the door uh okay let's see i think i'm getting a message i need another little podium here no no messages ah oh somebody sent a sketch okay um oh no i need it wasn't it was emailed to me so i got an email actually which with a sketch here but it wasn't sent via dropbox so i have to um uh let me see if i can get it let me see if i can pull it open i really don't want to log in oh the camera cut out hold on everybody hello okay so uh somebody sent me an email i'm gonna have to share it via dropbox myself because i uh i don't want to log into my email on a live stream but people send me lots of very private and touching beautiful messages that i know they wouldn't want to see it online okay um ship share dropbox sorry everyone i'll have this in a moment i don't know how what do you what do people like on the radio there's you're not ever supposed to have silence is this kind of like the radio dropbox share uh share this folder with uh videos at shiftmoon.net okay so this is coming in from this is coming in from from joel uh matthew i don't know maybe i'm not supposed to say people's names i don't know it's quick okay uh let's see if i can get this sketch now that was sent to me uh dropbox ah invited to share except hit accept right let's go to dropbox folder there it is here it is okay so let's look at this um so we've got a nice little sketch here i think the files are still coming in still downloading so we'll wait so let's look at the question um i test a ball the question says i'm reading i test the ball for collision the the text collision is 95 of the time but occasionally the ball falls right through so i'm not sure if it's a um voice it's really slow it's not in yet i'm not sure if this is a ball versus ball collision or a ball versus wall collision but i wonder we're gonna look at the sketch in a second but if you have a sketch where you have this ball and you're testing right if this is like the bottom of the screen height maybe you have an if statement where you say if y is greater than height maybe you're testing if the ball goes past this part then you're going to do something like hey maybe there's a variable called y speed which is telling us how the ball is moving down and you're saying y speed equals y speed times negative one this we're going to see if the code is actually related to this question but this is potentially a problem why is this a problem you know we don't really know different things could be happening you know you can seems like an exact science but uh we could have a situation where the ball goes past the height it turns around but it doesn't actually make it all the way back it turns around and just goes to here and then what's that problem it's still below height so this would still be true and it would tell it to go back down so you can often get these scenarios where something is stuck below the surface now there's nobody there's nobody to talk back to me because i don't know nobody's on the hangout right now but um but there's a nice solution to this which is what we could often do is just set y directly to height so that if the ball goes down in addition to setting it back we also sneak its location right back there so we kind of like nudge it back onto the screen but let's see let me try to go back to the sketch which is now downloaded um okay so one thing that's interesting about this is i'm getting ah here we go javascript intersect whoa okay so this is going to be a big so this is not we're going to run this and maybe we'll see that there's a problem but this is probably going to be much too this is a large sketch than about kind of having looked at it uh and there's already some other stuff going on audio stuff so i'm gonna i guess i'm gonna have to unfortunately speak more generally or less uh uh unless um whoever sent this in wants to try to ask a more specific question about the scenario but right now i don't want to uh because i could like sign off and debug and sign back on okay wait i got a message here uh no link you you just have to share with videos okay um now let's see what's happening on twitter thank you for doing this live stream it's quite interesting uh we will hang out with okay um so if you want to maybe i'm gonna check my email maybe somebody emailed me oh you can't see me right now hurry up maybe somebody emailed me to get invited to the hangout okay wait uh i've got somebody who maybe wants to join i'm going to try to invite them let's see if i can do this um i really don't like where this podium is but i have to work on this later okay invite invite interestingly enough unless you're the original creator of the hangout you cannot invite someone so let me see if you can invite yes hello all right we have somebody yeah that's me hi dan this is dave pentecost hi nice to see you virtually almost in person the other day but now virtually this is great uh running the screen behind you that's a nice trick thank you um okay so what's going on what's happening today in uh processing land uh well uh andres was around all weekend uh are actually saturday evening to uh what's that i think um you might have the stream open in a different window yeah i do hold on all right we have somebody it's kind of like in the old days when they said turn your radio down okay i've stopped it in another window can you can you see me or am i screwing things up here no no you're absolutely fine i actually can't see you but i can hear you i can't see you if i look over here so now i can see you okay i'm standing over here in this direction i don't see anyone okay well but now i don't see you on the oh right there we go yep so uh so andres was here can you hear me yeah yeah yeah so andres was here and um uh he struggled a bit with this uh with this hemispheric projection it turns out the fisheye that's in version two is not the right thing it's not the right fisheye for the dome uh he came to a conclusion that it's a lot more complicated than he expected and he started working with a different approach well we know that there's a 1.5 version somebody else came up with and that we can use with some of the samples including some of uh robert hodgins things we could try that with that but for the 2.0 stuff he's still struggling with your camera yeah camera goes off every 30 minutes okay um so let me know i don't know that anybody else is actually watching this but just um also because i have some questions just this might be just an interesting brief discussion that we can have so you uh have a uh planetarium dome so it's uh and is it just a single projector or what's the kind of a single computer what's the setup yeah okay so it's a single fisheye projector i wanted to wanted to make it as simple as possible for anybody like you or andres or anybody any other visualizers to come in and uh plug in and immediately put things up there but the coolest thing of course would be if we can frame any of the processing sketches with a fisheye view so it uh it looks in perspective we can have things floating around us in the dawn right so if you just took a regular processing sketch put it through the projector and projected it would look distorted is that what's happening without right if if it's um yeah you see a distorted rectangle depending on the size of uh of the sketch you'll see a distorted rectangle we can do that we can throw it up there right um and but if it's in a circle that's 1200 by 1200 pixels 1200 diameter then it can fill the dome if it's a radial sketch it might look cool in the dome but if it's a 3d sketch we've got to impose this this hemispheric projection on it for it to look in perspective so it ideally should be a circular and 1200 pixels in diameter right our our projector actually is uh goes up to 1600 pixels but right now we have the windows computer that's running the astronomy software in uh dueling dvi at 1600 and i'm in an hdmi input which only goes up to 1200. so 1200 is pretty i mean the 1200 is manageable for computing purposes and it's pretty simple anybody can come in and plug in i wonder if even just using something like mad mapper would somehow have like a it could take like a little simple 3d model of the dough and then uh the process well the problem is yeah the problem is you really have to simulate a 180 degree fisheye lens right so you need to create you need to do it with a uh you know one of these cubic projections that are actually like having a bunch of cameras that you then shoot the results from and project up there interesting well the good news is if there's anybody well suited to figure this out his name is andres yeah that's what i thought too but he was pretty stumped last night he left a little dejected but he's determined um so i look forward to having a chance to come look at it too right yeah it's it's pretty fun as i say you know almost anything projected up in the dome looks cool it's coolest if it if it's up there in proper perspective if you're a stickler about that right uh and also since you're going to be doing these this unit with your students about projecting space which looks very cool um this you know i i mean projecting space on a flat screen that's how we look at everything everywhere else besides the planetarium but they might find it uh interesting to see it actually surrounding them so yeah it would be perfect i mean my kind of idea would be to have some basic examples that show how to make a sketch that would run there and let the students play with it and then actually go over and try them out right it's gonna be once uh andres has the the uh the bugs worked out on this it's gonna be a pretty simple matter to drop your sketch into a draw scene uh area in his fisheye met up right awesome so that'll be that'll be fun and i think you'll find it interesting i want to i want to connect you as i i said in the email i think i want to connect you with uh carter emmerd who has kind of spearheaded this radicalization do you know carter uh yes i've met him before he came here at itp to give a presentation okay so you know you know what he's done yeah yeah and uh so a lot i i read robert hodgins um uh post about going going trying to figure out how to deal with the distances and the sizes of uh of the astronomical objects and presumably carter and his uh exstudents have wrestled with this and come up with this solution so you can you can see what you think when you see that working too awesome so now i've now i've hijacked your information here no no there's no so this is just actually a test we are just trying to test to see if this system here in this room which i've been using to record stuff could also be broadcast live and the things that the thing that i've discovered is you google hangouts which you can broadcast um people can't just add themselves they have to be invited so i need a system by which i either have people in advance or that they can um as well as sort of hard to kind of manage and figure out like if people can ask a question or whatever but i i i thank you for calling in because that was really helpful to kind of test this and i'm gonna just kind of see if there are any other uh twitter messages or emails of other people who might want to ask a question or try and i'm probably oh it's 4 15 i'll probably turn this i have to go soon so i'll probably turn this off okay you better better get on to your other customers i did have one more question how do you do the superimposition of you on the screen have you got a little device there so um this has actually been done so you're referring to the fact that yeah yeah so um the good news is i'm going to we've made a documentation video about how all of this stuff works in this room which i just need to post which will explain it with more detail but the short answer is um there is a camera and a laptop and both the feed from the camera which is recording me excuse me in the feed from the laptop which is you're seeing here both go into one machine as capture devices and software called wirecast is uh compositing them and this is just a green screen so right here is a green screen which you can actually see i think i'm in the hangout right right i figured it was a green you can see this is there's the actual laptop yep this is just a green screen and uh they're being if this is obviously the noncomposited view uh there and then this is the composite view yep thank you awesome thanks for calling and i'll be in touch over email okay okay all right let's see um okay so let's see what else oh i'm in the wrong place here um i guess i'm going to i feel like i should have a song or something to finish off with let's see either no other twitter messages there are there's a youtube comment that says hi and i don't have any emails so um i think actually it's 4 15 this was a good test if you like this maybe we'll do it again um i don't know what's a nice song uh to finish off with uh we were testing uh audio with fanfare from the cop for the common man of course they're gonna make us watch an ad hey it's interesting because i can't tell it's just like think this ad thank you everyone for tuning in if um i don't know that i'll do another test uh i don't know that i will do another test this summer uh but i will i might do one more test this summer uh but the we're going to kind of organize this a bit more and try to make this a weekly event where you could possibly ask questions over twitter maybe maybe you could join the hangout to actually be here and ask questions i don't know if anyone's watching um but i guess this gets recorded so um and maybe some way of like sharing sketches through dropbox so if you have ideas uh for how this might work better or if you have a question you want to ask for like again i probably do this till september you can send me an email um know with your sketch attached so i'm gonna figure out how to turn this off which i think i have to go to this computer and click end the broadcast i'm gonna click end broadcast i think the hangout will still be here but the broadcast will open
