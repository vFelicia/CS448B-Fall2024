00:01 - so this is the last video about particle
00:04 - systems and I just want to kind of tack
00:05 - on one little additional thing which is
00:07 - you know it's probably very clear to you
00:10 - from looking at all these examples and
00:11 - seeing everything that I've put up here
00:13 - in processing is that visual design and
00:16 - it's not really part of this video
00:18 - series you know all the examples we have
00:20 - these gray circles with black outlines
00:22 - white background whatever but one thing
00:24 - we should mention is you know if you
00:27 - look at how particle systems are
00:28 - traditionally used and I'm not it says
00:31 - just thing you use them in a traditional
00:32 - way but they're used to create smoke
00:35 - effects fire effects starry glowy
00:38 - wonderful kinds of things and typically
00:42 - this is not done by just drawing grey
00:44 - circles with black backgrounds typically
00:46 - this is started by drawing each particle
00:48 - as a texture as an image as some bitmaps
00:51 - set of pixels that you've designed in a
00:54 - particular way so I just want to briefly
00:56 - talk about this and show a few things in
00:59 - a couple examples so this is example 4.8
01:02 - which is just showing you it's kind of
01:04 - reworked the particle system a little
01:06 - bit put it on the bottom instead of the
01:07 - top instead of gravity pulling things
01:10 - down things are pushing up and the
01:11 - particles are fading out more quickly
01:13 - and they're all just drawn as white
01:14 - circles and you know there's a wind
01:16 - force here that I can move the mouse
01:18 - around if I stand out of the way and it
01:20 - affects which way this is blowing and it
01:23 - kind of has a little bit of a smoky
01:25 - perhaps fiery effect if I were more
01:27 - clever I would add some oranges and reds
01:29 - and maybe I could get it to be fire so
01:31 - one thing that we could do is something
01:33 - like this to make it kind of even more
01:36 - of a small clock Walla T is instead of
01:38 - drawing circles we could draw images so
01:40 - if I go to this processing sketch and
01:42 - look at the data folder there are a few
01:44 - different PNG files here and I'm sorry
01:46 - these those it's not very big you can
01:47 - see I've got these PMG files which were
01:49 - made in Photoshop this one I borrowed
01:51 - from a flight for a for example colorful
01:53 - and this one I just made in Photoshop
01:54 - and if I open it up and zoom back out
01:57 - here we can see here that what is this
02:01 - PNG sorry
02:05 - what is this PNG but it is a bright
02:08 - Center with get darker and darker
02:11 - towards the outside and more
02:12 - transparent so instead of a circle where
02:15 - the white color is uniform all the way
02:17 - throughout it fades away as we get out
02:19 - towards the edges so if I go back to the
02:21 - code and instead of drawing an ellipse
02:23 - with a fill I draw that image with a
02:27 - tint right remember this is what it
02:29 - looks like with the ellipse now if I hit
02:32 - save and run again we can see this is
02:34 - what it looks like with that P&G so I
02:36 - don't know how much you can tell here
02:38 - the difference but you can see this kind
02:40 - of smokey like quality to it with the
02:42 - PNG allows it to be more I don't know
02:45 - blend it in somehow anyway so this is
02:47 - kind of part one of this the other thing
02:50 - I just wanted to mention so that's
02:51 - drawing an image now how do you do that
02:53 - where do you put the image in our
02:54 - examples there's really very little here
02:56 - we just see now that the particle itself
02:58 - has a P image variable but one thing I
03:02 - want to point out about this is you
03:03 - might have thousands of particles you
03:05 - don't want each particle to load the
03:08 - image in its constructor you don't want
03:10 - to load the image here you would not
03:12 - want to put particle load image texture
03:15 - right or whatever it is whatever the
03:17 - name of that file name is you want to
03:19 - load the image just once for all of the
03:22 - particles and that's done in this
03:23 - particular example in setup load image
03:26 - is called and setup it's passed that
03:28 - image you can't really see because I
03:29 - can't scroll up boy watching this one
03:31 - it's passed to the particle system the
03:34 - particle system knows about the image
03:35 - for all the particles and the particle
03:37 - system itself when it makes new
03:40 - particles gives the particle that image
03:43 - so that's just another structural thing
03:45 - that I wanted to mention this is just
03:47 - like what we did I've totally screwed
03:49 - this up just like what we did with
03:51 - forces we the force was passed in the
03:54 - particle system which is passed to all
03:55 - the particles we want to do the same
03:57 - thing with the image we want to make
03:58 - sure we load that image only once in
04:00 - setup so I'm going to change something
04:02 - I'm gonna change this to colorful and
04:04 - I'm gonna run this with a PNG that was
04:07 - taken from a flight for a for example
04:11 - and if we go and look at well what does
04:13 - that PNG look like it looks like this
04:15 - you can see it's got a couple rings of
04:17 - color and it fades away towards the
04:19 - outside so this is looking kind of
04:21 - insane
04:22 - here but let's let's let's why do I want
04:25 - to use this
04:26 - image so one thing is it's very big and
04:28 - so I'm just going to mental note prepare
04:34 - for these videos I'm just gonna draw it
04:37 - a little bit smaller you can see okay
04:38 - well I kind of have this red thing maybe
04:40 - it looks more like fire maybe that's too
04:42 - small I'm gonna make it a lot bigger I'm
04:44 - messing around but what did I want to
04:46 - emphasize here I want to emphasize
04:48 - something this first of all it's running
04:50 - very slow and when we start to use image
04:53 - textures this is a time where it might
04:56 - make sense to go to Processing's P to D
04:59 - or P 3d render the P 2d renderer for
05:02 - example it uses OpenGL hardware
05:06 - acceleration which is very very fast at
05:08 - drawing images many many images to the
05:09 - screen and you can see here now we have
05:12 - our kind of colorful particles it looks
05:13 - like there's maybe a glowy Center but
05:15 - something about this isn't quite right
05:16 - it's not the effect that I was going for
05:19 - if you've looked at any flight 404
05:20 - examples of particle systems from years
05:22 - ago and processing or the work that's
05:24 - like that that's in cinder these days
05:26 - you'll see there's something else going
05:28 - on and that trick is called additive
05:31 - blending try to get through this video
05:32 - before I sneeze the trick is called
05:35 - additive blending additive blending is
05:37 - available in P 2 D and P 3d it is a
05:40 - blend mode what does it mean when colors
05:43 - are blended instead of averaging them
05:45 - together or other types of blending you
05:47 - could do they're added together as
05:48 - colors are layered those RGB values are
05:51 - added on top of each other meaning the
05:54 - color gets brighter and brighter so if I
05:56 - just change this to blend mode add and
06:01 - run this again you can see now I have
06:04 - this kind of glowy fiery thing and I
06:08 - would like to tweak this more and allow
06:10 - the particles to live longer and play
06:12 - with the size and the color but this
06:13 - additive blending is a real way that you
06:16 - can make textures and it works really
06:19 - well to get this kind of glow effect or
06:21 - a fire effect the blend mode that you
06:25 - choose of how you blend the particle
06:26 - textures on top of each other can be
06:28 - really important so let me do this video
06:31 - later but we will leave it for now and
06:34 - so here's your exercise for yourself one
06:36 - thing I would say that these examples
06:38 - don't do
06:39 - if all the particles have the same
06:40 - texture how would you make a particle
06:42 - system where you pick randomly from an
06:44 - array of possible P images that's
06:47 - something in might and how and you might
06:48 - just try like give yourself a goal like
06:50 - I want to make it look like fire I want
06:52 - to make it look like snow I want to make
06:54 - it look like rain
06:54 - what does it goal pick a goal and try to
06:56 - design particle textures that really
06:58 - create that feeling or that quality of
06:59 - that that and when you make something I
07:02 - don't know share it with the world
07:06 - email it tweet it
07:07 - I don't know write a note and put it in
07:10 - the mail and I'll get the note and I
07:12 - don't know if I have an address but
07:13 - whatever so okay so that's just what I
07:16 - wanted to mention you can look at these
07:17 - examples four-point-eight there's an
07:19 - additive blending example 4.9 that you
07:21 - can look at for this as well and I'm
07:23 - going to press a button here and
07:25 - whatever stuff is mess

Cleaned transcript:

so this is the last video about particle systems and I just want to kind of tack on one little additional thing which is you know it's probably very clear to you from looking at all these examples and seeing everything that I've put up here in processing is that visual design and it's not really part of this video series you know all the examples we have these gray circles with black outlines white background whatever but one thing we should mention is you know if you look at how particle systems are traditionally used and I'm not it says just thing you use them in a traditional way but they're used to create smoke effects fire effects starry glowy wonderful kinds of things and typically this is not done by just drawing grey circles with black backgrounds typically this is started by drawing each particle as a texture as an image as some bitmaps set of pixels that you've designed in a particular way so I just want to briefly talk about this and show a few things in a couple examples so this is example 4.8 which is just showing you it's kind of reworked the particle system a little bit put it on the bottom instead of the top instead of gravity pulling things down things are pushing up and the particles are fading out more quickly and they're all just drawn as white circles and you know there's a wind force here that I can move the mouse around if I stand out of the way and it affects which way this is blowing and it kind of has a little bit of a smoky perhaps fiery effect if I were more clever I would add some oranges and reds and maybe I could get it to be fire so one thing that we could do is something like this to make it kind of even more of a small clock Walla T is instead of drawing circles we could draw images so if I go to this processing sketch and look at

name is you want to load the image just once for all of the particles and that's done in this particular example in setup load image is called and setup it's passed that image you can't really see because I can't scroll up boy watching this one it's passed to the particle system the particle system knows about the image for all the particles and the particle system itself when it makes new

the force was passed in the particle system which is passed to all the particles we want to do the same thing with the image we want to make sure we load that image only once in setup so I'm going to change something I'm gonna change this to colorful and I'm gonna run this with a PNG that was taken from a flight for a for example and if we go and look at well what does that PNG look like it looks

is it's very big and so I'm just going to mental note prepare for these videos I'm just gonna draw it a little bit smaller you can see okay well I kind of have this red thing maybe it looks more like fire maybe that's too small I'm gonna make it a lot bigger I'm messing around but what did I want to emphasize here I want to emphasize something this first of all it's running very slow and when we
