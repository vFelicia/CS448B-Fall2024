00:00 - hello welcome to this video in this
00:03 - video I just want to do a short quick
00:05 - tutorial about my workflow for the
00:07 - tutorial videos that you're about to
00:09 - watch as part of this programming from A
00:11 - to Z playlist but also I use this
00:12 - workflow in a lot of my other videos and
00:14 - coding challenges and I'm sure my
00:16 - workflow will change at some point in
00:17 - the future but this is relevant for the
00:19 - time period then it's relevant so let me
00:21 - just come over here and make a short
00:22 - list of some things that I'm using so
00:26 - one thing is you want to make sure if
00:28 - you want to use my exact workflow there
00:29 - are lots of other workflows you want to
00:32 - install something called nodejs
00:34 - and then you want to install and I'm
00:37 - going to show you how to do this a node
00:39 - package called HTTP server this runs a
00:44 - little local web server on your computer
00:46 - that hosts the HTML CSS and JavaScript
00:49 - files that you're programming and
00:50 - working with so that you can see them
00:52 - you know of course you can just double
00:53 - click them and open them in the browser
00:55 - but if you run an actual web server on
00:57 - your computer you're going to mirror the
00:59 - real situation when eventually publish
01:02 - your files to a web server somewhere so
01:04 - I use those I also need a text editor to
01:07 - edit your code and edit the JavaScript
01:09 - files the HTML files all that sort of
01:10 - stuff I'm using a text editor called
01:12 - atom and with this text editor I'm using
01:16 - a package called I think it's called
01:18 - atom a links to all these things will be
01:21 - in this video's description so if I get
01:22 - the name wrong Adam - beautify so that's
01:25 - an that's something that I just like
01:27 - that Auto indents my code and that sort
01:29 - of thing and then I should also mention
01:31 - that there are a bunch of I believe
01:33 - there's something called atom live
01:35 - server and there are other packages in
01:38 - adamant will run the server for you that
01:40 - you can use instead of HTTP server if
01:43 - you prefer I should also mention that
01:45 - I'm working with p5.js libraries so
01:50 - you'll see that all of my projects have
01:51 - a bunch of extra javascript files
01:54 - associated with them they come from
01:55 - p5.js and p5.js
01:58 - and eventually soon I a camp later this
02:03 - month if you're watching this in
02:04 - September 2016 there will be a web
02:07 - editor that you can use
02:10 - with a p5 GS for developing sketches and
02:14 - ideas that go along with this course as
02:15 - well and at some point when that is
02:16 - released I'll demonstrate that in a
02:18 - video as well I should also mention that
02:20 - there are lots of other wonderful code
02:22 - editors you can use online code pen is
02:26 - one that I've used it has a wonderful
02:28 - professor mode which allows you to type
02:30 - code and that your students see on their
02:32 - screens the code that you're typing in
02:33 - real-time jsfiddle thimble and I don't
02:39 - know why I can't think of other good
02:41 - ones that I'm forgetting now whoo so I
02:42 - apologize if you make a wonderful code
02:45 - editor online that I'm not thinking of
02:46 - so this is the workflow I'm using let me
02:48 - demonstrate it for you rather quickly
02:49 - you write him over here uh and okay so
02:54 - Adam is something you should download
02:55 - from with Adam dot IO I've already
03:01 - downloaded it so I'm just going to run
03:02 - it here it is a oh it's already opening
03:08 - something so let's when you open it
03:10 - it'll probably look more like this an
03:13 - empty thing I could do command and I
03:16 - have a new file and I can type stuff
03:17 - into it so it's just a text editor any
03:19 - text editor will do oh yes install my
03:23 - update I guess what's gonna happen
03:25 - everything's gonna break
03:26 - oh please work okay so okay so this is
03:31 - Adam that's what it looks like packages
03:35 - you can install you can see here this is
03:37 - this beautiful package that I'm using
03:39 - and I'm also using something called Adam
03:41 - key mapping so I set it to beautify to
03:43 - be to command T which is my preference
03:46 - shortcut so maybe I could cover that in
03:49 - another video or a link to how to set up
03:51 - key mappings and Adam in this video's
03:53 - description and you can also see there I
03:56 - do I have the live server somewhere a
03:58 - live server here so you can see this is
04:00 - a live server package which will also
04:02 - start a live server you can install how
04:04 - do you install Adam packages uh I forget
04:08 - uh window I was going to say preferences
04:14 - uh packages yes so and maybe I could
04:22 - timeout pause oh yes no nevermind keep
04:25 - going install so here's a place that I
04:28 - can that you can search for packages or
04:31 - find featured packages to install and
04:33 - add things to Adam okay
04:35 - so then now the other thing you want to
04:37 - install is a node which I'm good which
04:40 - you can find at node s org you can
04:43 - download install node and then from
04:45 - terminal though you can from terminal
04:51 - you can use something called NPM which
04:54 - stands for node package manager and you
04:56 - want to type NPM HTTP - oops
05:00 - HTTP - server this is installing the web
05:05 - server that I'm using but you can't just
05:08 - install HTTP - server you need to say -
05:11 - g4 global meaning you're making this a
05:14 - global package which means you can just
05:16 - access it instead of being a packages
05:18 - for one project it's just accessible on
05:20 - your computer - until the end of time
05:22 - basically or do you understand node and
05:24 - if you do that you also probably want to
05:26 - say sudo because you might need sudo as
05:29 - a way of saying I'm the administrator of
05:30 - this computer I have permission to
05:31 - install something globally and if I hit
05:33 - enter it's going to ask me for my
05:35 - password and then I already installed it
05:39 - so I don't know what just happened there
05:40 - but oh I said to hold the wrong command
05:43 - Cantera Lee hope you're not npm install
05:47 - HTTP server and now it's going to
05:51 - install it so it's installing it and
05:52 - once I've done that I can I'm running a
05:56 - web server in a bunch of other
05:57 - directories I'm going to stop that I can
05:59 - just anywhere I am on the computer I can
06:02 - just say HTTP server and I can run a web
06:06 - server now where do you want to run the
06:08 - web server from probably from a
06:10 - directory where you have a project that
06:12 - you're working on like I have this load
06:14 - text project I can CD to that directory
06:17 - I can say HTTP server and then I can go
06:20 - to the browser with this particular URL
06:23 - which is just
06:25 - the local host of my computer one 27.0
06:28 - 0.1 colon 8080 and hopes I can go back
06:32 - to the browser and I can paste that URL
06:34 - in and you can see oops refreshed
06:38 - there's the project it was you can see
06:40 - there's nothing there because there's no
06:41 - code in that project but if I were to
06:43 - add some code to that project you would
06:44 - see this project displayed in the page
06:46 - now one other thing i think that i
06:49 - thought of that i wanted to mention
06:50 - about this which i have now completely
06:52 - forgotten oh yes if you don't like port
06:55 - 8080 you can also one thing i'll mention
06:58 - to you is you can say HTTP - server - p
07:01 - and i can make up a port like what's my
07:04 - favorite number 1 2 3 4 maybe i should
07:08 - of intact i'm going to be higher port
07:09 - numbers are better that you don't mess
07:11 - up something that's already running on
07:12 - your computer so I'm going to say 80 81
07:13 - and you can see now I'm running that
07:16 - same server on 80 81 so you can't run
07:18 - multiple web servers on the same port
07:20 - but if you need to run multiple web
07:22 - servers on the same time you can use
07:24 - different ports ok so that's a quick
07:26 - just little ditty on my workflow I'm
07:31 - sure I missed something or you have
07:32 - questions about it which you can ask in
07:33 - the comments and now you're ready to go
07:35 - and watch the video tutorials or
07:37 - actually make some stuff using this
07:38 - workflow ok thanks
07:42 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hello welcome to this video in this video I just want to do a short quick tutorial about my workflow for the tutorial videos that you're about to watch as part of this programming from A to Z playlist but also I use this workflow in a lot of my other videos and coding challenges and I'm sure my workflow will change at some point in the future but this is relevant for the time period then it's
