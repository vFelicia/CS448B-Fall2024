00:00 - (bell dings)
00:01 - - Okay, I'm back.
00:02 - I'm going to do some,
00:04 - I made a Mastodon bot.
00:05 - All it did so far was tweet,
it didn't tweet, it tooted.
00:10 - Toot, tweet, blog, post, who
knows what all this stuff is?
00:14 - All I know is that it said,
(whistle blows) choo choo.
00:17 - So I would like to show
you some more things to
00:21 - make the bot a little bit
better before we move on
00:23 - and hopefully start making
some actual interesting
00:25 - examples of different kinds
of bots you might want
00:27 - to try to make.
00:28 - So the first thing that
I want to do is actually,
00:30 - I don't want to have all
of this, all these secret
00:33 - keys and everything right here in my code
00:36 - because I'm going to
upload this as an example
00:38 - for other people to use.
00:39 - I want to be able to hide that
stuff away, but still use it.
00:41 - There's actually a wonderful node package.
00:43 - Thank you to Alka for the suggestion,
00:48 - called a dotenv.
00:51 - So I'm going to say npm install dotenv.
00:56 - I'm going to install this node package.
00:58 - What this allows me to
do is create environment
01:00 - variables for a particular project.
01:03 - That way I can upload the code
without the values of those
01:08 - environment variables, but
anybody who's using that code
01:10 - could set their own values for
those environment variables.
01:14 - So what I'm going to need
to do is create a new file,
01:18 - I'm going to call it .env.
01:20 - So it's kind of like, you
can see it right here,
01:22 - it's like a hidden file .env.
01:24 - It even has this crazy setttings thing.
01:27 - Then in this, ooh, look
there's all these extensions
01:30 - I could use probably to
like format it in all sorts
01:33 - of fancy ways.
01:34 - But I'm not going to be fancy.
01:35 - What I'm going to do and
I'm looking over here
01:37 - because thankfully Alka
gave me some suggestions,
01:40 - I'm going to say things like AUTH_TOKEN=
01:45 - CLIENT_SECRET= and I'm
going to say CLIENT_ID=.
01:50 - I think those are my three things.
01:52 - So that they're in the
code, client_key is this.
01:57 - I'm going to put this
back in here, client_key,
01:59 - okay I guess CLIENT_KEY is what I meant.
02:02 - Does it need to be in quotes?
02:04 - Maybe somebody can tell me.
02:05 - Maybe it shouldn't be in quotes actually.
02:08 - I'm going to get the client secret.
02:11 - Then I'm going to go back to the env file
02:13 - and put that in here.
02:14 - Right now I'm using single
quotes, which may or may not
02:15 - be correct.
02:17 - Then I'm going to go back to my code.
02:18 - I'm going to get the access token
02:21 - and I'm going to call it ACCESS_TOKEN,
02:23 - just to be consistent with my naming.
02:27 - Now if I do this, I can now go to my bot
02:31 - and I can also say const env = require
02:40 - and then I want to require a dotenv.
02:44 - Okay, just for consistency's
sake maybe I'll make
02:46 - this capital letters, I don't know.
02:48 - Then I'm going to say, then
I need to call ENV.config
02:51 - which will load it.
02:52 - The chat thankfully helped
me out that I do not want
02:54 - quotes here.
02:55 - It'd either adjust the values
03:00 - and then I should be able
to now, down here somewhere,
03:06 - I should be able to say
ahh, I should be able to say
03:08 - process.env.CLIENT_KEY.
03:15 - This will now.
03:18 - Is that right, process.env?
03:19 - Let me take a look.
03:20 - I have the documentation over here.
03:23 - Yeah, I think that's right.
03:24 - So I should be able to grab
those environment variables.
03:27 - Whoops, just like this.
03:30 - Then the CLIENT_SECRET.
03:35 - Then I should be able to grab this one
03:38 - and say ACCESS_TOKEN.
03:43 - Who knows if I've made some mistakes?
03:45 - But let's try running this now.
03:47 - Let's "Choo choo!
03:49 - Um, Choo choo, choo choo!
03:53 - Let's say choo choo
twice and let's run this.
03:58 - All right (claps hands) I
think this might have worked.
04:03 - We can see.
04:05 - This is the wrong page again.
04:07 - Choo choo choo choo!
04:09 - We could see that work.
04:10 - So all of this stuff is now hidden inside
04:16 - my environment file and what
I'm also going to do now
04:21 - is I'm going to make
04:24 - I'm going to make another
file called .env-sample.
04:28 - Then I'm going to copy this into there.
04:31 - Into here and then I'm going
to take out all this stuff.
04:37 - I'm going to make, because
eventually I'll put this
04:39 - on git.
04:41 - I'm going to make a file called .gitignore
04:44 - and then I'm going to say .env.
04:47 - So basically what I've
done is I'm saying, hey,
04:50 - this is my file .env.
04:52 - That's my file that I'm
only ever going to have
04:54 - locally on my computer.
04:56 - But when I publish this, I'm
going to publish a sample one,
05:00 - which has information basically,
05:01 - about what you need to
put in there and then
05:04 - I'm going to make sure that
the actual .env file is
05:07 - not included if I ever check
this into a git repository
05:10 - uploaded on git hub, so to speak.
05:12 - Let's make sure this works.
05:16 - Still working, we can
go here and I've said,
05:21 - (laughs) somebody
definitely hacked my bot,
05:24 - so I'm going to read which is great,
05:25 - because I had my keys up
on the screen (laughs).
05:28 - (bell dings) Well done whoever you are.
05:31 - I am going to take a break
and regenerate my access keys
05:36 - so that nobody else can hack my bot,
05:38 - keep them hidden in my environment file
05:40 - and then I am going to,
before something bad happens,
05:45 - I'm going to just close
out of this window and I'm
05:47 - going to come back and
show you more about writing
05:52 - Mastodon bots.
05:53 - I'm going to show you this
fun thing called spoiler_text.
05:57 - And how to have the bot post
to Mastodon periodically
06:00 - every so often.
06:01 - (claps hands) Okay so see
you in the next video.
06:03 - (techno music)
