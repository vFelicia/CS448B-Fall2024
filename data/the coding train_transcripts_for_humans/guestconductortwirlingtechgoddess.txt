00:00 - hello and welcome to another guest
00:02 - conductor video here on the coding train
00:05 - now it's been a minute since i had a
00:07 - guest video
00:08 - i'm hoping that 2021 that i can really
00:12 - pick up the pace here i have a goal of
00:14 - having at least one
00:15 - guest video per month and what's a
00:17 - better time to start than
00:19 - march now in case you've missed some of
00:21 - the other guest conductor videos
00:23 - i featured a 3d modeling live stream
00:26 - from chrissy brimage
00:27 - a cozy coding session with aaron davey
00:30 - and a video by amigos code and you can
00:32 - find all of these
00:33 - in the guest conductors playlist on the
00:35 - coding train today i am
00:37 - so excited to feature a video from lily
00:40 - james
00:41 - lily is channeling her engineering
00:43 - education
00:44 - dance training and resourcefulness
00:46 - through queer
00:47 - femme and black identities into a wild
00:50 - and wonderful youtube series
00:52 - twirling tech goddess as a computer
00:55 - science major
00:56 - lily encourages radical diversity and
00:57 - inclusion by making the process of
00:59 - learning tech more fun
01:00 - accessible and relatable to people
01:02 - underrepresented in stem
01:04 - so the very first thing that you should
01:05 - do right now and i'll put up a card and
01:07 - maybe an animation to remind you
01:09 - is go and subscribe to the twirling tech
01:11 - goddess
01:12 - subscribe click the notifications button
01:14 - you don't want to miss anytime
01:16 - lily releases a new video now to be
01:18 - honest i had a pretty hard time
01:20 - picking which video of lilies to feature
01:23 - and show here on the coding train
01:25 - they're all amazing and and i think the
01:26 - word i should really use here is
01:28 - fabulous
01:29 - but i've settled on one and it is called
01:31 - 3d printing a motorized
01:33 - high fashion hat i don't talk a lot
01:36 - about hardware or 3d or fashion on the
01:38 - coding terrain
01:39 - and this is really the one of the main
01:40 - reasons you should make sure to also
01:42 - subscribe to twirling tech goddess you
01:43 - really want to
01:44 - round out your youtube education lili's
01:46 - creativity
01:47 - in using a combination of 3d printing
01:49 - alongside open source models is really
01:51 - aligned
01:52 - with the coding trains goals of making
01:53 - technology approachable
01:55 - as part of this video and thank you to
01:57 - lily james for introducing me to this
01:58 - wonderful organization coding train is
02:00 - making a donation
02:01 - to queer asterisk a colorado-based 501c3
02:05 - nonprofit
02:06 - providing queer informed counseling
02:07 - services educational trainings
02:09 - and community programming i'll include a
02:11 - link to the queer asterisk website in
02:13 - this video's description where you can
02:14 - learn more and make a donation if you'd
02:16 - also like to support them
02:17 - but we are here to see the twirling tech
02:20 - goddess
02:21 - i will note this is a reposting of an
02:23 - existing video on her channel so what
02:25 - i'd really like you to do as strange as
02:27 - this might sound

02:32 - a card will pop up go and watch it over
02:35 - on
02:35 - her channel if you choose to say that's
02:38 - okay too the video will play you'll get
02:39 - to experience it but whatever you choose
02:41 - make sure you subscribe to the twirling
02:43 - tech goddess turn those notifications on
02:45 - you don't want to miss a video
02:46 - i am so honored to be able to share this
02:48 - youtube channel with you you're in for a
02:50 - real treat if you haven't experienced it
02:51 - before
02:52 - um and i hope to see you in a future
02:53 - cutting train video
02:55 - hi inventors i'm lee lee the twirling
02:57 - tech goddess i'm black i dance i'm queer
03:00 - and
03:00 - i'm an engineer welcome to the twerk
03:02 - shop a show that explicitly encourages
03:04 - radical diversity and inclusion by
03:06 - making the process of learning tech more
03:08 - fun accessible and relatable to people
03:10 - underrepresented in stem
03:11 - each week you'll come along with me as i
03:13 - create something fabulous using cutting
03:15 - edge tools and technologies
03:16 - then i'll put it through my patented
03:18 - twirl test to make sure that it's stage
03:19 - ready
03:20 - that's right we twirl with our tech
03:22 - because you know what they say
03:23 - the family that slays together increases
03:26 - their socioeconomic status together
03:32 - [Music]
03:44 - on this episode we're going to be making
03:46 - a motorized headpiece using one of my
03:48 - favorite technologies
03:50 - 3d printing i'll walk you through the
03:53 - hardware and software that we'll be
03:55 - using
03:55 - for the production and design of the
03:57 - headpiece and then i'll introduce you to
03:59 - the motorized
04:00 - element that we'll use to make it move
04:01 - and spin a little backstory when i was
04:04 - on tour as a figure skater a french
04:05 - compatriot of mine noticed that anytime
04:07 - i saw something cute in a shop
04:09 - i would hold it up to my head like so
04:12 - so fall semester i'm walking through the
04:14 - bookstore on campus here
04:16 - and i spot a little heart that's like
04:18 - moving and i
04:19 - knew i needed to have it on my head so i
04:21 - asked the sales clerk where can i get
04:22 - one of those and i basically blacked out
04:25 - as he spouted off all this information
04:26 - about how to make it and i had no idea
04:28 - what
04:28 - i was talking about so here we are two
04:30 - semesters later and i finally have the
04:31 - tools and skills to make it happen
04:33 - so let's get started
04:42 - so this is a 3d printer this one belongs
04:45 - to the school
04:46 - and it was about two thousand dollars
04:48 - this one belongs to me
04:49 - and it's a tenth of the price and a lot
04:51 - less cumbersome
04:52 - so this one doesn't even work so let's
04:54 - get this raggedy piece out of here and
04:56 - get to work
04:59 - this is the bed it gets hot
05:02 - this is the extruder it gets hotter this
05:05 - is the filament you'll use
05:07 - and you feed this filament into the
05:10 - extruder
05:11 - it melts it drips it on the bed
05:14 - makes a 3d print it's amazing
05:27 - there's multiple ways to get the image
05:30 - to the extruder
05:32 - via this processor one of the ways is
05:35 - using an external
05:36 - sd card you can also connect it directly
05:39 - to your laptop using a usb cable or your
05:42 - desktop
05:49 - when it comes to 3d printing you first
05:51 - need the document that you want to print
05:53 - much like any 2d print job on a paper
05:56 - printer you can print a pre-existing
05:57 - document or you can create your own
05:59 - document
05:59 - we'll touch more on creating 3d models
06:01 - in a future video where i'll be creating
06:03 - my own high heels
06:04 - today however we'll be using a
06:06 - pre-existing document to create a
06:08 - motorized headpiece
06:09 - the documents have authors and those
06:12 - authors are published as specific sites
06:14 - sites such as yegi and cults 3d have 3d
06:17 - prints that authors
06:18 - artists creators post for sale if you
06:21 - purchase the right 3d printer however it
06:22 - may in fact come with some complimentary
06:24 - exclusive 3d models designed by
06:26 - excellent designers for that specific
06:29 - brand such as
06:29 - ultimaker there are also document
06:32 - libraries of sorts that offer open
06:33 - source free download of pre-existing
06:35 - document models such as
06:37 - thingiverse which is hands down the most
06:39 - popular and the one we'll be using for
06:41 - this project
06:42 - now let's go over to thingiverse and
06:44 - download the gearheart document
06:46 - link in the description these downloads
06:49 - come in various types and you'll want to
06:50 - look for the
06:51 - stl file to download that one there are
06:54 - other file types but for now we'll just
06:55 - focus on
06:56 - our dot stl files next we'll download a
07:00 - 3d printing app think of this as our
07:02 - print preview
07:03 - for this project i'll be using cura link
07:06 - in the description below
07:07 - from inside cura we'll import our stl
07:10 - file this takes our 3d model and slices
07:12 - it creating a new render that can be
07:14 - printed layer by layer
07:15 - now let's get the document to the
07:17 - printer and let the printer
07:19 - do its thing
07:30 - [Music]
07:34 - first i printed a prototype and i'm glad
07:36 - i did because this specific print had an
07:39 - enclosed bottom and i needed an open
07:41 - bottom for the motor
07:42 - after finding the parts that better
07:44 - suited my needs and removing the parts
07:46 - that didn't i merged those files and
07:48 - made a second print
07:49 - which is the one that i provided for you
07:51 - all link in the description
07:53 - and now let's talk post production
07:56 - so depending on the pla you use you may
07:58 - or may not need
07:59 - or want to smooth the surface of your
08:01 - print
08:02 - as you can see up close prints leave
08:05 - layer lines
08:06 - so to smooth that surface you may want
08:09 - to use
08:09 - sandpaper to get rid of some of those
08:11 - lines
08:12 - and you can also soak your piece in
08:16 - acetone or nail polish remover once
08:18 - you've done that you can also prime the
08:20 - surface with a plasti-dip or primer
08:23 - if you're gonna paint on top of it or
08:26 - adhese any glitter
08:27 - or be dazzling effects so this is your
08:30 - motor
08:31 - it's a few bucks link in the description
08:33 - you can just get these on amazon
08:35 - super simple you power it and it spins
08:39 - this is going to be our external power
08:41 - source it's a battery pack
08:43 - four batteries go inside you can get
08:45 - these in the size of three batteries
08:47 - this four batteries is six volts
08:49 - three batteries is going to be four
08:51 - volts and two batteries is three volts
08:53 - the thing that i love about this is it
08:55 - also has this handy dandy on
08:57 - off switch so we can turn it on and make
09:00 - sure we have
09:00 - power if we see a little spark we know
09:03 - that this is working so i'm going to use
09:04 - these
09:05 - alligator clips available at any
09:07 - hardware store these are a few bucks
09:10 - so that i don't actually have to touch
09:11 - the wires now that they're live
09:15 - and i'm going to connect one of those to
09:17 - each of the rivets
09:20 - on the motor and boom
09:22 - [Music]
09:26 - oh super handy so
09:29 - now you'll get the idea if i take the
09:32 - fan piece off
09:34 - pop the headpiece on
09:38 - houston we have liftoff
09:42 - to turn this into a headpiece we're
09:45 - gonna need a few things
09:47 - essentials handy-dandy glue gun and glue
09:50 - sticks
09:52 - your favorite pair of scissors your
09:54 - least favorite headband
09:57 - and a small tupperware with lid
10:00 - and keep your motor nearby so we're
10:03 - going to build from the bottom
10:04 - up is my strategy so i take the headband
10:07 - which is going to rest here on my head
10:10 - and we're going to glue the bottom
10:14 - or the base of the tupperware onto our
10:18 - headband
10:18 - and that will house the motor
10:24 - and then we'll put our lid on the motor
10:28 - and then hot glue our headpiece
10:31 - onto the lid which will allow the motor
10:34 - to stay
10:34 - weatherproof inside let's get started
10:48 - [Music]
11:12 - me
11:16 - [Music]
11:22 - so now that this thing is fully
11:24 - assembled
11:26 - i'm already thinking of finishing
11:28 - touches and
11:30 - embellishments that i want to make to
11:32 - cover the headband and cover the
11:33 - tupperware and i invite you to play and
11:35 - have fun with
11:36 - your finishing touches and
11:37 - embellishments please
11:39 - share your photos and videos of your
11:41 - creations down in the comments below
11:44 - and they better not look like mine
11:49 - now let's take this headpiece for a
11:50 - twirl a wearable
11:52 - isn't useful to me if it's not stage
11:54 - ready so i'm gonna go get changed and
11:56 - i'll see y'all on the
12:00 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome to another guest conductor video here on the coding train now it's been a minute since i had a guest video i'm hoping that 2021 that i can really pick up the pace here i have a goal of having at least one guest video per month and what's a better time to start than march now in case you've missed some of the other guest conductor videos i featured a 3d modeling live stream from chrissy brimage a cozy coding session with aaron davey and a video by amigos code and you can find all of these in the guest conductors playlist on the coding train today i am so excited to feature a video from lily james lily is channeling her engineering education dance training and resourcefulness through queer femme and black identities into a wild and wonderful youtube series twirling tech goddess as a computer science major lily encourages radical diversity and inclusion by making the process of learning tech more fun accessible and relatable to people underrepresented in stem so the very first thing that you should do right now and i'll put up a card and maybe an animation to remind you is go and subscribe to the twirling tech goddess subscribe click the notifications button you don't want to miss anytime lily releases a new video now to be honest i had a pretty hard time picking which video of lilies to feature and show here on the coding train they're all amazing and and i think the word i should really use here is fabulous but i've settled on one and it is called 3d printing a motorized high fashion hat i don't talk a lot about hardware or 3d or fashion on the coding terrain and this is really the one of the main reasons you should make sure to also subscribe to twirling tech goddess you really want to round out your youtube education lili's creativity in using a combination of 3d printing alongside open source models is really aligned with the coding trains goals of making technology approachable as part of this video and thank you to lily james for introducing me to this wonderful organization coding train is making a donation to queer asterisk a coloradobased 501c3 nonprofit providing queer informed counseling services educational trainings and community programming i'll include a link to the queer asterisk website in this video's description where you can learn more and make a donation if you'd also like to support them but we are here to see the twirling tech goddess i will note this is a reposting of an existing video on her channel so what i'd really like you to do as strange as this might sound is stop this video right now pause this video there's a link in the description a card will pop up go and watch it over on her channel if you choose to say that's okay too the video will play you'll get to experience it but whatever you choose make sure you subscribe to the twirling tech goddess turn those notifications on you don't want to miss a video i am so honored to be able to share this youtube channel with you you're in for a real treat if you haven't experienced it before um and i hope to see you in a future cutting train video hi inventors i'm lee lee the twirling tech goddess i'm black i dance i'm queer and i'm an engineer welcome to the twerk shop a show that explicitly encourages radical diversity and inclusion by making the process of learning tech more fun accessible and relatable to people underrepresented in stem each week you'll come along with me as i create something fabulous using cutting edge tools and technologies then i'll put it through my patented twirl test to make sure that it's stage ready

preexisting document models such as thingiverse which is hands down the most popular and the one we'll be using for this project now let's go over to thingiverse and download the gearheart document
