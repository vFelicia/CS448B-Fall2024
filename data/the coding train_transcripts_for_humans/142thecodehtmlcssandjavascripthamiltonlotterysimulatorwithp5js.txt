00:00 - now on to part two of this these videos
00:03 - about the Hamilton lottery so in part
00:05 - one I went through all the math behind a
00:08 - lottery that assumes 10 pairs of winning
00:10 - tickets out of 50,000 a one in 5,000
00:13 - chance of winning one of those pairs and
00:15 - if you enter the T enter that Lottery
00:17 - 23,000 times you're going to have a 99%
00:21 - chance of winning at least once so I did
00:23 - all the math behind that now what I want
00:24 - to do is make a web page simulate the
00:27 - lottery doing it over and over again and
00:30 - allow users to change to make 15 pairs
00:32 - of tickets available five pairs of
00:33 - tickets available and have all the
00:35 - numbers change to reflect that so let's
00:37 - go look at how we might do that so first
00:39 - let's just write some code to simulate
00:42 - the lottery with these numbers
00:44 - themselves so if I go to my JavaScript
00:47 - code I have an empty p5js sketch if
00:50 - you're not familiar with p5js I'll refer
00:52 - to you all my p5js videos but I have a
00:54 - setup function where things start and a
00:55 - draw function where things Loop so what
00:58 - I'm going to do is say um
01:01 - I'm going have a variable called uh
01:03 - total which equals 5,000 that means
01:07 - there is maybe I should call that
01:08 - probability like a one in 5,000 chance
01:11 - uh you have a one in 5,000 chance of
01:13 - winning the lottery so this is sort of a
01:15 - silly thing I can do but I can say pick
01:18 - a random
01:19 - number between zero and 5,000 or between
01:24 - uh right so pick a random number between
01:27 - 0 and 5,000 the highest number is
01:28 - actually 4,99 99 right because between 0
01:31 - and 9 that's actually 10 numbers 0 1 2 3
01:34 - 4 5 6 7 8 9 UM and then I'm going to
01:37 - also use the P5 or JavaScript function
01:40 - floor which will ensure that that number
01:43 - is a whole number an integer number
01:45 - right so uh I'm only getting 12 31 so
01:49 - if that number were to equal I don't
01:53 - know I'm just going to pick one let's
01:54 - let's say let's say we're equal to
01:56 - one right if I happen to pick one I
01:58 - could have picked zero I think I could
01:59 - have picked three it could have pick 20
02:00 - it doesn't matter then I've won the
02:03 - lottery one
02:05 - Lottery otherwise
02:08 - console.log lost
02:11 - lottery so I could run this program and
02:14 - you could see I'm losing the lottery
02:16 - over and over and over again over and
02:18 - over and over again now remember we had
02:21 - to play the lottery 23,000 times to have
02:24 - a 99% chance of winning at least once so
02:26 - we might be here for a while before I
02:28 - actually win the lottery at least once
02:30 - and I was sort of hoping it might happen
02:31 - by accident but it's not happening right
02:33 - now so let's just go adjust the code to
02:35 - be sure what we're doing makes sense and
02:37 - by the way this should be that
02:39 - variable did we win yet no so let's just
02:42 - make this a 50 I have a one in 50 chance
02:45 - of winning the lottery we should win
02:47 - that fairly quickly if we're doing it
02:48 - over and over again so let's make sure
02:50 - this actually works with
02:53 - 50 yes yes so you can see I'm winning
02:56 - the lottery a bunch of times so I played
02:58 - 96 times and then than I won then 12
03:00 - more times than I won then 82 more times
03:02 - than I won then 34 more so you can see
03:04 - how this works so one thing I want to do
03:07 - now is I want to have the web page right
03:11 - I want to have this web page have a
03:13 - button that you press the button and you
03:15 - start playing the lottery and then I
03:17 - want to have a Dom element on the page
03:19 - tell me whether I've won or lost so
03:21 - right now everything's just printing out
03:22 - to the console so how do I do that so
03:24 - the first thing I want to do and there's
03:26 - a lot of different ways you could
03:27 - approach this problem with any number of
03:29 - JavaScript Frameworks I'm going to do it
03:31 - one particular way so what I'm going to
03:33 - do is I'm going to go to the HTML file
03:35 - and down here I'm going to add another
03:37 - paragraph and I'm going to make a button
03:39 - element and can you see this I'm going
03:40 - to zoom in on it button I'm going to
03:42 - give it an ID and I'm going to call that
03:44 - ID start so I'm making a button to
03:47 - appear on the page and I'm going to uh
03:49 - make the text for that button start
03:50 - entering Lottery and I need to zoom out
03:53 - here uh uh and then I'm going to say
03:55 - slash button so I add this to the web
03:59 - page and I need need to close the close
04:01 - the paragraph tag as well once I add
04:03 - that to the web page you can see there
04:05 - it is their button now is there start
04:07 - entering lottery so I want some code to
04:09 - trigger when I press that button how do
04:11 - I have code trigger when you press a
04:13 - button in P5 using the P5 G framework ah
04:17 - first of all I have to have access to
04:19 - this Dom element somewhere in my code
04:20 - there it is in the HTML file and it's it
04:23 - is um it has an ID called start that ID
04:26 - is very important because that's the way
04:27 - I'm going to access that Dom element and
04:30 - I should mention you need to have the P
04:32 - for this code to work you also need to
04:34 - have the p5.js library included in what
04:37 - you're doing so I'm going to add a
04:40 - variable called button and in setup I'm
04:43 - going to say button equals
04:45 - select
04:47 - start so you can see button equals
04:49 - select start so now I have got that
04:52 - button and I'm going to say button. mous
04:57 - pressed start Lottery
05:00 - which means when you press the mouse
05:02 - start the lottery what's start Lottery
05:04 - it's a
05:05 - function that I'm going to write called
05:07 - start lottery so maybe I'll do something
05:09 - this is sort of a silly way to do it I
05:10 - could do it any number of other ways but
05:12 - I'm going to say make a variable called
05:14 - started and I'm going to have that equal
05:16 - to false and in the draw Loop I'm going
05:19 - to say if started do all this
05:25 - stuff and let me just indent this
05:28 - because I am obsessed with
05:31 - indentation and then in start Lottery
05:33 - I'm going to say started equals true now
05:35 - all of you JavaScript programmers out
05:37 - there are probably going to complain to
05:38 - me all sorts of ways I'm doing this
05:40 - wrong for example this function could
05:42 - actually just be right inside of mouse
05:44 - press as an what's called an anonymous
05:45 - function and I the draw Loop is maybe a
05:47 - silly thing to have here because there's
05:49 - no actual like drawing animation I could
05:51 - use something like set interval to
05:53 - actually start the process of playing
05:54 - the lottery over and over again but for
05:56 - Simplicity I'm going to keep this model
05:58 - here for right now so we can see that if
06:01 - I refresh the page nothing is happening
06:03 - in the console but now if I press Start
06:05 - entering Lottery I'm playing the lottery
06:08 - I'm winning I'm losing I'm winning I'm
06:09 - losing because I have a one50 chance of
06:12 - winning it which is pretty good and I'm
06:14 - going to see Hamilton tonight okay um uh
06:18 - so um but okay I want to do something
06:20 - else instead of just logging to the
06:22 - console I now want the web page to tell
06:24 - me whether I've won or lost and I'm sure
06:26 - I could come up with a use canvas to
06:28 - make some clever animation or have
06:30 - things flying around the screen I leave
06:31 - that to you to be more creative with
06:33 - this um and but what I'm going to do now
06:37 - is just say the the Hamilton Lottery
06:39 - when you actually um I'm going to make a
06:42 - paragraph with an ID
06:44 - results when you play the actual
06:47 - Hamilton Li Li oh this needs quotes
06:49 - around it uh it just says try
06:52 - again so what I'm going to do right now
06:55 - in my code is I'm going
06:58 - to
07:00 - I'm going to get that Dom element using
07:04 - the select function and then instead of
07:06 - saying one
07:08 - lottery or lost lottery I will use the
07:11 - P5 HTML function to say try
07:15 - again
07:19 - or U1 so you can see here the idea here
07:23 - is that if I win put inside that
07:27 - paragraph element the words you one if
07:30 - I've lost put the words try again I'm
07:32 - also going to add something once I've
07:34 - won I kind of want to just stop the code
07:37 - from running at all and in P5 I can say
07:39 - no Loop and the code stops I mean how
07:41 - are we done doing here seven and a half
07:43 - minutes in this video I don't know if
07:44 - anyone's still watching okay so here we
07:46 - go and now I'm going to start entering
07:48 - the lottery it says try again and then
07:50 - immediately says you won and it
07:52 - stopped now let's go back and change it
07:56 - to uh one in
07:58 - 500 start I won pretty fast there uh and
08:02 - you know what I'm going to do I'm going
08:04 - to say I'm going to add the function
08:05 - Loop in here I'm actually going to say
08:08 - no Loop here so I'm going to have the
08:10 - program isn't going to be looping at the
08:12 - beginning anytime I hit start it starts
08:14 - the loop over um and uh the lottery
08:19 - starts running so uh here we go try
08:21 - again come on I'm going to win I want to
08:23 - win I want to win come on win I won yay
08:27 - who's who's going with me to the to
08:29 - front row tickets to Hamilton okay uh so
08:34 - I got I got I got I got momently got
08:36 - distracted thinking I actually won
08:37 - something it's very confusing here so
08:39 - one thing that I think would be useful
08:41 - is for the page to sort of show me how
08:43 - many times I've played so far so another
08:45 - thing I want to do is in
08:48 - this um here I'm going to I'm going to
08:51 - add another paragraph and I'm going to
08:52 - say you have played zero
08:57 - times so on the
09:00 - page it it says you have played zero
09:03 - times and when I press Start entering
09:05 - lottery I want that to start counting up
09:08 - showing me how many times I've played
09:10 - it's still zero so how do I
09:14 - modify I could you know just modify that
09:16 - whole paragraph but what if I want to
09:17 - modify just one number inside an
09:20 - existing paragraph So a way to do that
09:22 - is make this a span element span equals
09:26 - uh or span ID equals I'll call this
09:31 - total and if I go back to my code and I
09:36 - add a variable called total and have
09:38 - that equal to zero and then every time I
09:40 - play the lottery I increase total by one
09:43 - I could also
09:45 - say uh and you know what I'm going to
09:47 - show you something I can say select
09:49 - total. HTML total so one thing I can do
09:53 - in JavaScript is something called
09:55 - chaining do you see how here I said
09:57 - select results and then put that in a
10:00 - variable and say HTML well I could sort
10:02 - of bypass that by just saying select
10:04 - total. HTML total so update the total
10:07 - Dom element with the value in the total
10:10 - variable and now I'm going to run this
10:12 - again and here we go so we kind of have
10:15 - a little bit of a dynamic page now where
10:18 - it's saying try again it's telling me
10:20 - how many number of times I played I have
10:21 - this button I won after 459 times if I
10:25 - press the button oh it's doing it again
10:27 - so one thing I notice here that I might
10:28 - like to do is in start lottery I should
10:31 - reset total back equals to
10:34 - zero and we can see this again here we
10:38 - go am I going to win am I going to win
10:40 - but you know one thing I should remember
10:43 - is uh the probability here is uh 5,000
10:47 - so
10:48 - um I'm going to run this again so this
10:51 - is uh the basic idea here of kind of
10:54 - making a dynamic page a page that might
10:57 - have some information obviously my
10:58 - design Des level here and what's the
11:00 - content here is very simplistic I'm like
11:02 - waiting to win um and you might have
11:06 - some better and more interesting ideas
11:07 - I'm going to actually stop this video
11:09 - now I'm going to do one more and the
11:11 - next video I'm going to show you how to
11:12 - make this a bit more interesting by
11:14 - allowing some of these numbers to be
11:16 - editable by the user so what if the user
11:18 - could come up here and change that
11:20 - number 10 to suddenly have 20 tickets
11:22 - become available have all of these
11:24 - things update to have the number of
11:26 - times you have to play to get a 99%
11:27 - chance to update have the one in 5,000
11:30 - chance change what if I could sort of
11:31 - use a slider to change these values and
11:33 - then when you play the lottery the new
11:35 - probabilities actually happen I was
11:36 - really hoping that I would talk long
11:38 - enough that I would win before this
11:40 - particular video ends I'm going to let
11:41 - this keep running and in the next video
11:43 - you'll see hopefully the time that it
11:44 - took for me to win

Cleaned transcript:

now on to part two of this these videos about the Hamilton lottery so in part one I went through all the math behind a lottery that assumes 10 pairs of winning tickets out of 50,000 a one in 5,000 chance of winning one of those pairs and if you enter the T enter that Lottery 23,000 times you're going to have a 99% chance of winning at least once so I did all the math behind that now what I want to do is make a web page simulate the lottery doing it over and over again and allow users to change to make 15 pairs of tickets available five pairs of tickets available and have all the numbers change to reflect that so let's go look at how we might do that so first let's just write some code to simulate the lottery with these numbers themselves so if I go to my JavaScript code I have an empty p5js sketch if you're not familiar with p5js I'll refer to you all my p5js videos but I have a setup function where things start and a draw function where things Loop so what I'm going to do is say um I'm going have a variable called uh total which equals 5,000 that means there is maybe I should call that probability like a one in 5,000 chance uh you have a one in 5,000 chance of winning the lottery so this is sort of a silly thing I can do but I can say pick a random number between zero and 5,000 or between uh right so pick a random number between 0 and 5,000 the highest number is actually 4,99 99 right because between 0 and 9 that's actually 10 numbers 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 UM and then I'm going to also use the P5 or JavaScript function floor which will ensure that that number is a whole number an integer number right so uh I'm only getting 12 31 so if that number were to equal I don't know I'm just going to pick one let's let's say let's say we're equal to one right if I happen to pick one I could have picked zero I think I could have picked three it could have pick 20 it doesn't matter then I've won the lottery one Lottery otherwise console.log lost lottery so I could run this program and you could see I'm losing the lottery over and over and over again over and over and over again now remember we had to play the lottery 23,000 times to have a 99% chance of winning at least once so we might be here for a while before I actually win the lottery at least once and I was sort of hoping it might happen by accident but it's not happening right now so let's just go adjust the code to be sure what we're doing makes sense and by the way this should be that variable did we win yet no so let's just make this a 50 I have a one in 50 chance of winning the lottery we should win that fairly quickly if we're doing it over and over again so let's make sure this actually works with 50 yes yes so you can see I'm winning the lottery a bunch of times so I played 96 times and then than I won then 12 more times than I won then 82 more times than I won then 34 more so you can see how this works so one thing I want to do now is I want to have the web page right I want to have this web page have a button that you press the button and you start playing the lottery and then I want to have a Dom element on the page tell me whether I've won or lost so right now everything's just printing out to the console so how do I do that so the first thing I want to do and there's a lot of different ways you could approach this problem with any number of JavaScript Frameworks I'm going to do it one particular way so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to the HTML file and down here I'm going to add another paragraph and I'm going to make a button element and can you see this I'm going to zoom in on it button I'm going to give it an ID and I'm going to call that ID start so I'm making a button to appear on the page and I'm going to uh make the text for that button start entering Lottery and I need to zoom out here uh uh and then I'm going to say slash button so I add this to the web page and I need need to close the close the paragraph tag as well once I add that to the web page you can see there it is their button now is there start entering lottery so I want some code to trigger when I press that button how do I have code trigger when you press a button in P5 using the P5 G framework ah first of all I have to have access to this Dom element somewhere in my code there it is in the HTML file and it's it is um it has an ID called start
