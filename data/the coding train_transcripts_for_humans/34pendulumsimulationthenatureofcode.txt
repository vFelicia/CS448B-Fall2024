00:03 - hold on okay hi okay in this video we're
00:06 - going to talk about pendulums um now
00:09 - pendulums is really just this perfect
00:11 - perfect thing to look at right now
00:12 - because it it combines everything we've
00:14 - looked at really from the beginning of
00:16 - chapter 2 all the way up until now there
00:18 - are forces at play there's the force of
00:20 - gravity on the pendulum that's what
00:22 - causes it to swing but we need in order
00:24 - to deal in order to solve that simulate
00:26 - the pendulum we're going to need to look
00:27 - at trigonometry s and cosine again polar
00:30 - C polar coordinates and then we're also
00:32 - going to deal with angular motion the
00:34 - angle of the pendulum what's its angular
00:36 - velocity what's its angular acceleration
00:38 - so all these things are going to come
00:39 - into play and so it's a really nice it's
00:42 - a nice nice place to be for us right now
00:44 - now you know the question is how what
00:47 - how what are you going to do with this
00:48 - um on the one hand you might want to
00:50 - make a processing sketch with lots of
00:52 - pendulums if that's what you want to do
00:54 - perfect you're in exactly the right
00:55 - place but really what I'm hoping for
00:57 - this is if you can understand the
00:58 - pendulum scenario
01:00 - figure out how all the math works and
01:02 - apply it to a simulation then when you
01:04 - come across some scenario in your idea
01:07 - in your sketch with similar qualities
01:09 - you're going to be able to figure out
01:10 - the trigonometry problems the angular
01:12 - motion problems the forces problems okay
01:14 - so let's get started I'm I want to draw
01:16 - the pendulum I'm going to start by
01:17 - drawing the pendulum in two different
01:19 - ways this is a drawing a diagram of a
01:23 - pendulum at rest right there is this
01:25 - thing called an arm this is the arm and
01:28 - this thing called The Bob and and this
01:30 - is the Bob so this is our pendulum it's
01:32 - at rest now if we were to lift this up
01:35 - over here and let go it would swing back
01:37 - and forth like that so let's draw the
01:39 - diagram that
01:41 - way here's the pendulum now at an angle
01:45 - so an the the angle of the pendulum is a
01:47 - key property that we're going to need to
01:49 - look at and what do we mean by angle we
01:52 - mean the angle relative to the the axis
01:54 - of at being at rest so that angle Theta
01:57 - is relative the axis of where it would
01:59 - be hanging for at rest now what are what
02:01 - do let's let's let's start okay before
02:03 - we even figure out how to swing the
02:05 - pendulum you know sometimes this is a
02:06 - good thing to do when you're creating
02:08 - processing sketches like you know you
02:09 - want a swinging pendulum well can you
02:10 - even get the sort of static pendulum
02:13 - appearing on the screen in the one hand
02:15 - it's easy a line from here to there and
02:17 - a circle that's what we're going to do
02:19 - but let's look at what do we need in
02:20 - order to have this we need to know this
02:23 - location which we'll call the origin the
02:26 - origin XY we need to know the Bob's X Y
02:30 - and this is going to be an important
02:32 - value as well this is the length of the
02:35 - arm so what's the length of the arm this
02:38 - and of course we're going to deal with
02:39 - the angle Theta so let's actually just
02:41 - take a look I have a kind of a
02:42 - processing sketch that's already built
02:44 - um that do is doing just this part just
02:47 - to with the static what we're going to
02:48 - do in this video is we're going to piece
02:49 - by piece add all the simulation parts
02:52 - and have and eventually have this
02:53 - pendulum swinging okay so if we look
02:56 - over here uh we have a really simple
02:59 - sketch which just just has two B vectors
03:01 - one for the origin the top point one for
03:03 - the Bob's location and the length of
03:05 - that arm and we can see here that the
03:07 - Bob uh location is just the same x value
03:10 - as the origin but the yvalue is the
03:12 - length of that arm so that's all we're
03:14 - doing is want to is is drawing a line
03:17 - from the origin to the Bob and a circle
03:19 - where the Bob is so that's what we've
03:20 - got but that's only going to work if the
03:23 - pendulum's at rest what if the pendulum
03:26 - has an angle what if we lift that up to
03:27 - the side how do we do that okay that is
03:29 - part you know two of this video in
03:32 - however many parts okay so back over
03:34 - here let's take a look at that so let's
03:36 - say we know what the angle is we know
03:38 - the angle is say 45° or pi divided by
03:43 - four okay so we're going to say the
03:46 - angle or
03:47 - Theta has some value in this case we're
03:50 - going to say is Pi / 4 how do we get
03:53 - this location well let's take a look at
03:55 - something let's draw a right triangle
03:58 - here let's make this into a right
04:00 - triangle this is y and this is
04:04 - X origin uh from the origin we have to
04:07 - go down this much Y and over this x to
04:09 - find the Bob location assuming that
04:11 - angle so let's do a little trigonometry
04:15 - sooa all we need is SOA s and C so s of
04:23 - theta equals opposite over
04:26 - hypotenuse x / length
04:30 - opposite is X hypotenuse is the length
04:32 - of the pendulum in this case that is
04:34 - really important in our scenario in our
04:36 - right triangle the length is the
04:38 - hypotenuse the hypotenuse of that
04:39 - triangle is the
04:40 - length oh sorry cosine of
04:45 - theta is adjacent over hypotenuse or Y /
04:51 - length and this means that if we know
04:54 - the if we know the length and we know
04:56 - the angle we're going to be able to find
04:58 - the X and the Y because we can say x =
05:02 - length * sin of th and Y = length time
05:08 - cosine of theta this is exactly what we
05:10 - did in the polar to cartisian coordinate
05:12 - transformation video if you want you can
05:15 - go back and watch that one again we're
05:16 - doing exactly the same thing here I
05:18 - should say that things are a little bit
05:19 - flipped usually we look at an angle
05:21 - relative to the x-axis now we're looking
05:23 - at an angle relative to the Y AIS so you
05:25 - can see X has got s in the equation and
05:28 - Y has got cosine in the equation but if
05:30 - we can draw that right triangle and we
05:32 - can remember s opposite hypotenuse
05:35 - cosine adjacent hypotenuse then we can
05:37 - always derive these formulas and figure
05:38 - it out so we've got that let's go back
05:40 - to our processing sketch and put these
05:42 - formulas right in there okay come with
05:45 - me over here I I should like take off I
05:48 - have a sweater but anyway okay here we
05:50 - go uh now where where let's okay we've
05:53 - got this sketch okay first thing we need
05:56 - to do is add an angle variable to it so
05:58 - at the top I'm going to say hey float
06:00 - angle and that angle's just going to be
06:02 - zero for right now and now what we want
06:04 - to do is say Okay based on what that
06:07 - angle is I need to compute the Bob's
06:10 - location so what was the formula it's
06:13 - over here uh X length s y length cosine
06:18 - so if I come back here uh I can say Bob
06:21 - dox equals
06:24 - length Time s of the angle and
06:28 - Boby equals
06:31 - length time cosine of the
06:34 - angle now what did we miss there's one
06:37 - thing we missed in this equation here
06:38 - I'm going to come back over here for a
06:39 - second is that this Y and X is relative
06:42 - to the origin right we want to go this
06:45 - much y from the origin and this much X
06:48 - from the origin so we need to add we
06:50 - need to add the Y and the X to the
06:52 - origin's location so when we come back
06:54 - over here we're going to say okay the
06:56 - Bob's X location is origin X Plus that
06:59 - and the Bob's Y location is origin y
07:01 - plus that in truth of course we could
07:03 - have done this with uh we could have
07:05 - used P vector and the P vector's add
07:07 - function but just to kind of look at the
07:08 - formula in a sort of simplest way I
07:10 - think this is useful so let's run this
07:14 - now uh whoops I have an error can't find
07:17 - anything named length Okay in my in this
07:19 - particular sketch I named it Len rather
07:21 - than the full word length so I'm just
07:23 - going to correct that right
07:24 - now I'm going to run this and we can see
07:27 - ah there it is the same place that used
07:29 - to be but now we should be able to go
07:34 - and change that angle what if I made
07:36 - that angle pi divided by
07:38 - four right there we go now we have the
07:41 - pendulum at 45 degrees and I could do
07:44 - something like
07:46 - say I can start to increment the angle
07:50 - by some small amount and you can see the
07:52 - pendulum is starting to
07:54 - rotate and eventually it will come back
07:57 - I guess I should have subtracted that
07:59 - right it's moving but now we're not so
08:01 - so this is what we did essentially in
08:03 - some of our earlier videos we just have
08:04 - this thing moving with polar cartisian
08:06 - coordinates around and around now we
08:08 - need to actually look at why do we what
08:11 - is the force of the pendulum and how
08:13 - does that Force get applied to
08:14 - acceleration so let's go take a look at
08:16 - that and guess what we're going to use
08:17 - sign again s and cosine again okay so
08:20 - we'll let this keep spinning around kind
08:22 - of weirdly like it is and
08:28 - now so okay so let's come back to our
08:32 - pendulum we figured out how to draw the
08:34 - pendulum in the right place now what we
08:36 - need to do is figure out what is the
08:38 - angular acceleration of the pendulum
08:40 - okay so what are we talking about
08:44 - here here's the pendulum now the
08:47 - pendulum has a force of gravity on it
08:51 - that's the force of gravity it's pulling
08:52 - it down now the reason why the Bob
08:54 - doesn't just fall straight down is
08:56 - because you know there's a force of
08:57 - tension there's this Rod here there's
08:59 - this metal it's not metal whatever this
09:01 - whatever it is whatever it might be
09:03 - there's this arm here that's keeping it
09:04 - so we know the pendulum is going to move
09:07 - actually this direction right this is a
09:10 - right angle here so what we're actually
09:13 - looking for I'm going to draw another
09:15 - right
09:16 - triangle is this particular
09:19 - force that particular force is what we
09:23 - would call the force of the
09:26 - pendulum and interestingly enough we
09:29 - have have a right triangle here and if I
09:34 - extend this diagram a little bit and
09:36 - draw the axis for the pendulum at rest
09:38 - this is our angle Theta this is also our
09:40 - angle Theta so what we've actually done
09:44 - here this is kind of a little bit this
09:45 - is a big moment because this is kind of
09:48 - an important concept that's going to
09:50 - come up again and again in some future
09:51 - examples we've separated the out a
09:55 - particular Vector into components along
09:58 - an arbitrary axis so we know that
10:00 - vectors have components this Vector has
10:04 - an X and A Y component and we do this
10:06 - all the time because we have P vector v
10:09 - equals new P Vector X comma y right we
10:12 - think about the vector in terms of we
10:13 - know it's magnitude and Direction but
10:14 - really you know in the vector there's an
10:17 - X and A Y but we always do that relative
10:19 - to the x-axis here what we've done is
10:22 - separated this Vector out in terms of
10:24 - components relative to the axis of the
10:27 - pendulum and we need this particular
10:29 - component to be the force of the
10:32 - pendulum okay so what how do we get that
10:36 - well look at this what is if we call
10:39 - this FP I don't like the way I drew that
10:42 - let's just remedy that if this side is
10:44 - FP and this side is f of G notice
10:47 - something s of theta equals the force of
10:50 - the pendulum divided by the force of
10:55 - gravity whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa wait a
10:57 - second that's right right yeah of theta
11:00 - is opposite over hypotenuse that's the
11:02 - opposite that's the hypotenuse so what
11:04 - is the force of the pendulum it's just
11:07 - the force of gravity times s of
11:11 - theta now in truth there are some some
11:14 - missing pieces here and I'm not going to
11:16 - get first of all I'm not qualified to go
11:19 - through every little detail of
11:20 - everything that's happening in a
11:21 - pendulum in terms of torque and tension
11:24 - and air resistance and you know you
11:25 - could get into a really really elaborate
11:27 - simulation if you want to but this even
11:30 - just this much is going to do us a whole
11:33 - lot of good um uh we can add something
11:36 - to this which I'll do which I'll show
11:37 - you in a little bit later but this is
11:39 - this just being able to realize that the
11:41 - force how strong that Force is is sign
11:44 - of the angle if you think about that
11:46 - right when the pendulum's um at rest
11:49 - what's the angle it's zero what's sign
11:50 - of the angle zero so there's no Force
11:53 - there's no force of the pendulum um
11:56 - because the the pendulum's at rest um
11:58 - I'm sitting down so so sitting down like
12:01 - in its resting
12:02 - spot I could really use a script to
12:04 - write about someone wants to write one
12:06 - okay um so what do we need to do with
12:09 - this remember something Force equals
12:12 - mass time acceleration you know what is
12:14 - the force of gravity GF * m / distance
12:19 - squar all this stuff for us we can think
12:21 - of the force of gravity as a constant
12:23 - scaled by mass and the
12:27 - acceleration is equal to the force of
12:29 - the pendulum divid by mass so what we've
12:33 - really got in the end is acceler the
12:36 - angular acceleration of the
12:38 - pendulum is equal to the force of graph
12:41 - some constant kind of botch this times s
12:44 - of
12:47 - theta edit edit I'm not going to edit
12:49 - these someday I'll edit these let me go
12:51 - back and try that
12:52 - again okay for our purposes in this
12:55 - particular example we're going to
12:57 - consider the force of gravity to be a
13:01 - constant it is the equivalent of some
13:04 - constant times mass right because the
13:07 - more massive an object is the stronger
13:09 - the force of gravity so we're going to
13:11 - say some constant gtimes mass is the
13:14 - force of gravity time sin / Theta that's
13:18 - the force of the pendulum a constant the
13:21 - gravitational force times the object the
13:23 - Bob's mass time s of theta so what does
13:26 - that mean the acceleration is the
13:29 - angular acceleration of the pendulum is
13:30 - equal to the force divided by mass take
13:33 - G * mass time s of theta and divide it
13:35 - by mass and we have the pendulum's
13:37 - acceleration is equal to Su constant
13:40 - Time s of theta if that seems overly
13:43 - simple to you then great because in the
13:46 - end it's actually quite simple we're
13:48 - just scaling the acceleration is is
13:51 - essentially some constant times sign of
13:53 - the angle so that's why you know if you
13:56 - think like what wait sign oscillates
13:58 - theend oscillates it's all related it's
14:00 - all this magical soup of oscillation and
14:03 - trigonometry so but this is the formula
14:05 - we've now got this formula let's go
14:07 - stick this formula into our code and if
14:09 - you didn't understand this formula I
14:10 - don't know maybe re-watch the video and
14:13 - it'll make sense the second time or you
14:15 - don't know send me an email and I'm
14:17 - going to try to help do this explanation
14:19 - again u in the book maybe it's like it's
14:21 - edited so it's less um cockamamy okay um
14:25 - so here we are back again uh and now
14:27 - we're going to add this so first of all
14:29 - what's going on here this by the way 0
14:33 - 0.01 is the angular velocity the change
14:36 - in the angle is angular velocity so I'm
14:38 - going to go back and I'm going to add
14:40 - some more variables angular velocity and
14:42 - going make that zero and I'm make
14:44 - angular acceleration and I'm going to
14:45 - make that uh zero as well so our motion
14:50 - algorithm right is angle angle changes
14:53 - by
14:55 - velocity and velocity changes by EX
14:59 - acceleration and if we've got this we
15:01 - can see it's not moving why we haven't
15:03 - calculated the angular acceleration but
15:06 - we have this formula over here to
15:08 - calculate that angular acceleration G *
15:10 - s of theta G is a constant so we can
15:13 - just come over here and we can say
15:16 - angular acceleration equals some
15:18 - constant I don't know 0.01 * s of that
15:22 - Angle now a couple things are going to
15:24 - go wrong here but let's let's let this
15:26 - go okay first of all it's kind of
15:29 - swinging but it's swinging upside down
15:31 - so somewhere somehow we got our wires
15:34 - crossed and we you know we were doing
15:36 - this physics simulation and not this
15:38 - this diagrams and we were probably
15:40 - thinking of Y going up and in a
15:42 - processing window y goes down so we
15:44 - could investigate this but sometimes
15:45 - when something goes in the wrong
15:47 - direction you know we're we're
15:48 - processing programmers we can just kind
15:50 - of we we know we don't have to
15:52 - understand at all we just know multiply
15:54 - by negative 1 we'll go in the other
15:55 - direction so I'm going to just say
15:57 - negative .01 we're we're we're flipped
15:59 - we got to flip our world back upside you
16:01 - know processing points down we don't
16:03 - want to point up we got to flip
16:04 - ourselves negative one Okay now what's
16:07 - the other thing going on here I think
16:08 - it'd probably be useful to add a little
16:10 - bit of damping to make it feel a little
16:12 - realistic right a pendulum is going to
16:15 - be a lot lost in the kind of in the in
16:17 - the in the movement of the arm in air
16:19 - resistance so one thing I'm just going
16:21 - to do to like make it look a little
16:22 - nicer is multiply the velocity by like
16:25 - 99 each time 0 99 so the velocity
16:28 - reduces by one 1% so a pendulum doesn't
16:30 - swing forever it's going to kind of slow
16:32 - down and eventually come to rest and now
16:33 - if we run this hey that's pretty good
16:36 - it's swinging so we have our swinging
16:38 - pendulum wow it was as easy as that
16:40 - right if we know where the origin is and
16:43 - we know the angle we know the length we
16:45 - can calculate where the Bob is and if we
16:48 - understand that the angular acceleration
16:50 - of the pendulum is equal to the force of
16:51 - gravity times sign of that angle and we
16:53 - were able to derive that formula of the
16:55 - diagram then we can just put that right
16:57 - here in our code and we're good to go
17:00 - now so this was a little example of just
17:02 - kind of like whipping it together and
17:03 - draw and I guess actually I want to make
17:05 - a point here which is that um and this
17:07 - is certainly how I work although there's
17:09 - lots of different ways of working and
17:10 - farbe it for me to suggest that this is
17:12 - the best by any means but as you can see
17:14 - we didn't get ourselves kind of lost in
17:16 - object-oriented programming right now we
17:18 - just kind of have this main sketch and
17:21 - this main program we kind of set up and
17:22 - draw we knew we need a bunch of
17:23 - variables we're kind of working out we
17:25 - have the pendulum working now I'm not
17:27 - going to in this video take the next 10
17:29 - minutes to move everything into an
17:31 - object and build that object I kind of
17:32 - have that preset for you but this is you
17:35 - know this is often a good way to work
17:36 - kind of work out your you know work out
17:39 - everything in just kind of a raw and a
17:42 - messy way in in the main Tab and then
17:44 - once you've got the functionality
17:45 - refactor and build it into a class and
17:48 - so what I'm just going to show you now
17:49 - is if you're following along there is an
17:51 - example in oh I don't want to um I don't
17:54 - want the app store right now um there is
17:57 - this particular example which we can see
17:59 - has a pendulum object the pendulum
18:02 - object the Constructor takes two things
18:04 - it's where is the origin and how long is
18:07 - the arm and then you can see in draw all
18:10 - we're doing is saying P.O run all your
18:12 - simulation stuff we've actually added a
18:14 - few features in this example you can
18:16 - click on the pendulum and move it um so
18:19 - this is kind of a uh you know this is
18:22 - just the objectoriented version but you
18:24 - can see that everything that we worked
18:26 - out is all right here in the update
18:29 - function so in the update function we
18:31 - have a constant for Gravity we have the
18:33 - formula for angular acceleration angular
18:35 - acceleration goes into the velocity the
18:37 - velocity is dampened then the velocity
18:38 - then angle changes by the velocity so
18:40 - everything we worked out is here now in
18:41 - the pendulum's update function the one
18:44 - thing I should say is there's one extra
18:45 - thing which is that we divided by R the
18:49 - angular acceleration is affected by how
18:51 - long that arm is and this makes the the
18:53 - pendulum feel a bit more realistic I'll
18:55 - include some links to other physics
18:57 - discussions of pendulums but you can see
18:59 - that now if I make the pendulum arm
19:01 - really
19:03 - short it kind of swings much faster than
19:07 - if I made the pendulum arm really
19:10 - long and if I grab it you can see I let
19:12 - it swing there's a much sort of slower
19:14 - uh acceleration there because the short
19:17 - of the if we're the the acceleration is
19:19 - inversely proportional to the length of
19:20 - the arm so that's one little addition to
19:22 - this example that makes the pendulum
19:23 - feel a bit more realistic so um I'll
19:27 - give you a couple I have a couple EXC
19:28 - ideas which literally just occurred to
19:30 - me now well one of them occurred to me
19:31 - now and the other I guess I had already
19:33 - thought of but um hold on I just I don't
19:35 - know why I feel the need to put this
19:36 - back to where it was 175 um but there's
19:39 - a couple things so one thing you might
19:40 - try to do is if you remember I think in
19:42 - the first oscillation video uh we we
19:45 - looked at uh this uh other video there
19:48 - was a video in a video and it was very
19:50 - um what's that
19:52 - movie I don't know why I'm trying leca
19:55 - and it has nothing to do with anything
19:56 - edit cut okay and we're back and I
19:58 - didn't just talk about that but I did
20:00 - cuz no one's editing this um uh you know
20:02 - where there's levels of Dreams oh my God
20:05 - just stop go to the next video okay the
20:08 - exercise here's an exercise um try to
20:11 - create a whole bunch of pendulums in a
20:13 - row all across the top of a sketch
20:15 - perhaps start them all at slightly
20:17 - different offsets from each other I
20:19 - don't know give them all slightly
20:20 - different arm lengths give them all
20:22 - slightly different starting angles
20:24 - there's lots of ways you could create
20:25 - some type of really interesting um kind
20:27 - of multiple oscill pattern by doing that
20:31 - another thing you could do is put two
20:33 - pendulums together right uh what
20:39 - if the end of one pendulum is the
20:42 - beginning of another and so on and so
20:44 - forth now here's the thing this is
20:47 - what's called a double pendulum and
20:48 - simulating a double pendulum involves
20:50 - all sorts of uncomfortable and math that
20:54 - I don't even I don't even I mean I'm
20:56 - going to pull up that web page and I'm
20:57 - going to have to go sit down for a while
20:58 - and drink I don't some orange juice or
21:00 - something because I get a little woozy
21:01 - but um so you could look into sort of
21:04 - real double pendulum simulation and
21:05 - you'll find pages on Wikipedia and wolf
21:08 - from math world and all that sort of
21:09 - stuff but one thing you could do just as
21:10 - kind of a little experiment is see what
21:12 - happens if just you use the fact that
21:15 - this pendulum has a bob P vector and
21:17 - this pendulum has an origin P Vector
21:19 - what if you make those values always the
21:21 - same so at least they're sort of
21:22 - connected not they won't be connected in
21:24 - the physics way but they will be
21:25 - connected just in the fact that the code
21:27 - always sets those locations equal what
21:29 - types of effects could you get through
21:30 - that so um so those are some some ideas
21:33 - that you might try with this pendulum
21:35 - stuff and someday I'm going to go and
21:36 - make answers to all these exercises that
21:39 - I keep saying um and if you really want
21:40 - one if you send me an email it'll sort
21:42 - of push me to do that at least for this
21:44 - one and I'll put them in some open
21:46 - source repository for everyone to see
21:47 - okay so that I think this wasn't so bad
21:50 - I was a little anxious about this
21:51 - pendulum stuff but I think we did okay
21:53 - there's some improvements here um but in
21:55 - the next video we're going to look at
21:57 - Springs which is just another case study
21:59 - right we're going to say hey pendulums
22:01 - hey Springs these are two examples you
22:03 - know we don't need pendulums and springs
22:04 - in all of our sketches but these are two
22:06 - examples of kind of working out a
22:07 - physics system understanding the math
22:08 - behind it and making it go okay I need
22:10 - to find a button to shut this off
22:13 - now

Cleaned transcript:

hold on okay hi okay in this video we're going to talk about pendulums um now pendulums is really just this perfect perfect thing to look at right now because it it combines everything we've looked at really from the beginning of chapter 2 all the way up until now there are forces at play there's the force of gravity on the pendulum that's what causes it to swing but we need in order to deal in order to solve that simulate the pendulum we're going to need to look at trigonometry s and cosine again polar C polar coordinates and then we're also going to deal with angular motion the angle of the pendulum what's its angular velocity what's its angular acceleration so all these things are going to come into play and so it's a really nice it's a nice nice place to be for us right now now you know the question is how what how what are you going to do with this um on the one hand you might want to make a processing sketch with lots of pendulums if that's what you want to do perfect you're in exactly the right place but really what I'm hoping for this is if you can understand the pendulum scenario figure out how all the math works and apply it to a simulation then when you come across some scenario in your idea in your sketch with similar qualities you're going to be able to figure out the trigonometry problems the angular motion problems the forces problems okay so let's get started I'm I want to draw the pendulum I'm going to start by drawing the pendulum in two different ways this is a drawing a diagram of a pendulum at rest right there is this thing called an arm this is the arm and this thing called The Bob and and this is the Bob so this is our pendulum it's at rest now if we were to lift this up over here and let go it would swing back and forth like that so let's draw the diagram that way here's the pendulum now at an angle so an the the angle of the pendulum is a key property that we're going to need to look at and what do we mean by angle we mean the angle relative to the the axis of at being at rest so that angle Theta is relative the axis of where it would be hanging for at rest now what are what do let's let's let's start okay before we even figure out how to swing the pendulum you know sometimes this is a good thing to do when you're creating processing sketches like you know you want a swinging pendulum well can you even get the sort of static pendulum appearing on the screen in the one hand it's easy a line from here to there and a circle that's what we're going to do but let's look at what do we need in order to have this we need to know this location which we'll call the origin the origin XY we need to know the Bob's X Y and this is going to be an important value as well this is the length of the arm so what's the length of the arm this and of course we're going to deal with the angle Theta so let's actually just take a look I have a kind of a processing sketch that's already built um that do is doing just this part just to with the static what we're going to do in this video is we're going to piece by piece add all the simulation parts and have and eventually have this pendulum swinging okay so if we look over here uh we have a really simple sketch which just just has two B vectors one for the origin the top point one for the Bob's location and the length of that arm and we can see here that the Bob uh location is just the same x value as the origin but the yvalue is the length of that arm so that's all we're doing is want to is is drawing a line from the origin to the Bob and a circle where the Bob is so that's what we've got but that's only going to work if the pendulum's at rest what if the pendulum has an angle what if we lift that up to the side how do we do that okay that is part you know two of this video in however many parts okay so back over here let's take a look at that so let's say we know what the angle is we know the angle is say 45° or pi divided by four okay so we're going to say the angle or Theta has some value in this case we're going to say is Pi / 4 how do we get this location well let's take a look at something let's draw a right triangle here let's make this into a right triangle this is y and this is X origin uh from the origin we have to go down this much Y and over this x to find the Bob location assuming that angle so let's do a little trigonometry sooa all we need is SOA s and C so s of theta equals opposite over hypotenuse x / length opposite is X hypotenuse is the length of the pendulum in this case that is really important in our scenario in our right triangle the length is the hypotenuse the hypotenuse of that triangle is the length oh sorry cosine of theta is adjacent over hypotenuse or Y / length and this means that if we know the if we know the length and we know the angle we're going to be able to find the X and the Y because we can say x = length * sin of th and Y = length time cosine of theta this is exactly what we did in the polar to cartisian coordinate transformation video if you want you can go back and watch that one again we're doing exactly the same thing here I should say that things are a little bit flipped usually we look at an angle relative to the xaxis now we're looking at an angle relative to the Y AIS so you can see X has got s in the equation and Y has got cosine in the equation but if we can draw that right triangle and we can remember s opposite hypotenuse cosine adjacent hypotenuse then we can always derive these formulas and figure it out so we've got that let's go back to our processing sketch and put these formulas right in there okay come with me over here I I should like take off I have a sweater but anyway okay here we go uh now where where let's okay we've got this sketch okay first thing we need to do is add an angle variable to it so at the top I'm going to say hey float angle and that angle's just going to be zero for right now and now what we want to do is say Okay based on what that angle is I need to compute the Bob's location so what was the formula it's over here uh X length s y length cosine so if I come back here uh I can say Bob dox equals length Time s of the angle and Boby equals length time cosine of the angle now what did we miss there's one thing we missed in this equation here I'm going to come back over here for a second is that this Y and X is relative to the origin right we want to go this much y from the origin and this much X from the origin so we need to add we need to add the Y and the X to the origin's location so when we come back over here we're going to say okay the Bob's X location is origin X Plus that and the Bob's Y location is origin y plus that in truth of course we could have done this with uh we could have used P vector and the P vector's add function but just to kind of look at the formula in a sort of simplest way I think this is useful so let's run this now uh whoops I have an error can't find anything named length Okay in my in this particular sketch I named it Len rather than the full word length so I'm just going to correct that right now I'm going to run this and we can see ah there it is the same place that used to be but now we should be able to go and change that angle what if I made that angle pi divided by four right there we go now we have the pendulum at 45 degrees and I could do something like say I can start to increment the angle by some small amount and you can see the pendulum is starting to rotate and eventually it will come back I guess I should have subtracted that right it's moving but now we're not so so this is what we did essentially in some of our earlier videos we just have this thing moving with polar cartisian coordinates around and around now we need to actually look at why do we what is the force of the pendulum and how does that Force get applied to acceleration so let's go take a look at that and guess what we're going to use sign again s and cosine again okay so we'll let this keep spinning around kind of weirdly like it is and now so okay so let's come back to our pendulum we figured out how to draw the pendulum in the right place now what we need to do is figure out what is the angular acceleration of the pendulum okay so what are we talking about here here's the pendulum now the pendulum has a force of gravity on it that's the force of gravity it's pulling it down now the reason why the Bob doesn't just fall straight down is because you know there's a force of tension there's this Rod here there's this metal it's not metal whatever this whatever it is whatever it might be there's this arm here that's keeping it so we know the pendulum is going to move actually this direction right this is a right angle here so what we're actually looking for I'm going to draw another right triangle is this particular force that particular force is what we would call the force of the pendulum and interestingly enough we have have a right triangle here and if I extend this diagram a little bit and draw the axis for the pendulum at rest this is our angle Theta this is also our angle Theta so what we've actually done here this is kind of a little bit this is a big moment because this is kind of an important concept that's going to come up again and again in some future examples we've separated the out a particular Vector into components along an arbitrary axis so we know that vectors have components this Vector has an X and A Y component and we do this all the time because we have P vector v equals new P Vector X comma y right we think about the vector in terms of we know it's magnitude and Direction but really you know in the vector there's an X and A Y but we always do that relative to the xaxis here what we've done is separated this Vector out in terms of components relative to the axis of the pendulum and we need this particular component to be the force of the pendulum okay so what how do we get that well look at this what is if we call this FP I don't like the way I drew that let's just remedy that if this side is FP and this side is f of G notice something s of theta equals the force of the pendulum divided by the force of gravity whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa wait a second that's right right yeah of theta is opposite over hypotenuse that's the opposite that's the hypotenuse so what is the force of the pendulum it's just the force of gravity times s of theta now in truth there are some some missing pieces here and I'm not going to get first of all I'm not qualified to go through every little detail of everything that's happening in a pendulum in terms of torque and tension and air resistance and you know you could get into a really really elaborate simulation if you want to but this even just this much is going to do us a whole lot of good um uh we can add something to this which I'll do which I'll show you in a little bit later but this is this just being able to realize that the force how strong that Force is is sign of the angle if you think about that right when the pendulum's um at rest what's the angle it's zero what's sign of the angle zero so there's no Force there's no force of the pendulum um because the the pendulum's at rest um I'm sitting down so so sitting down like in its resting spot I could really use a script to write about someone wants to write one okay um so what do we need to do with this remember something Force equals mass time acceleration you know what is the force of gravity GF * m / distance squar all this stuff for us we can think of the force of gravity as a constant scaled by mass and the acceleration is equal to the force of the pendulum divid by mass so what we've really got in the end is acceler the angular acceleration of the pendulum is equal to the force of graph some constant kind of botch this times s of theta edit edit I'm not going to edit these someday I'll edit these let me go back and try that again okay for our purposes in this particular example we're going to consider the force of gravity to be a constant it is the equivalent of some constant times mass right because the more massive an object is the stronger the force of gravity so we're going to say some constant gtimes mass is the force of gravity time sin / Theta that's the force of the pendulum a constant the gravitational force times the object the Bob's mass time s of theta so what does that mean the acceleration is the angular acceleration of the pendulum is equal to the force divided by mass take G * mass time s of theta and divide it by mass and we have the pendulum's acceleration is equal to Su constant Time s of theta if that seems overly simple to you then great because in the end it's actually quite simple we're just scaling the acceleration is is essentially some constant times sign of the angle so that's why you know if you think like what wait sign oscillates theend oscillates it's all related it's all this magical soup of oscillation and trigonometry so but this is the formula we've now got this formula let's go stick this formula into our code and if you didn't understand this formula I don't know maybe rewatch the video and it'll make sense the second time or you don't know send me an email and I'm going to try to help do this explanation again u in the book maybe it's like it's edited so it's less um cockamamy okay um so here we are back again uh and now we're going to add this so first of all what's going on here this by the way 0 0.01 is the angular velocity the change in the angle is angular velocity so I'm going to go back and I'm going to add some more variables angular velocity and going make that zero and I'm make angular acceleration and I'm going to make that uh zero as well so our motion algorithm right is angle angle changes by velocity and velocity changes by EX acceleration and if we've got this we can see it's not moving why we haven't calculated the angular acceleration but we have this formula over here to calculate that angular acceleration G * s of theta G is a constant so we can just come over here and we can say angular acceleration equals some constant I don't know 0.01 * s of that Angle now a couple things are going to go wrong here but let's let's let this go okay first of all it's kind of swinging but it's swinging upside down so somewhere somehow we got our wires crossed and we you know we were doing this physics simulation and not this this diagrams and we were probably thinking of Y going up and in a processing window y goes down so we could investigate this but sometimes when something goes in the wrong direction you know we're we're processing programmers we can just kind of we we know we don't have to understand at all we just know multiply by negative 1 we'll go in the other direction so I'm going to just say negative .01 we're we're we're flipped we got to flip our world back upside you know processing points down we don't want to point up we got to flip ourselves negative one Okay now what's the other thing going on here I think it'd probably be useful to add a little bit of damping to make it feel a little realistic right a pendulum is going to be a lot lost in the kind of in the in the in the movement of the arm in air resistance so one thing I'm just going to do to like make it look a little nicer is multiply the velocity by like 99 each time 0 99 so the velocity reduces by one 1% so a pendulum doesn't swing forever it's going to kind of slow down and eventually come to rest and now if we run this hey that's pretty good it's swinging so we have our swinging pendulum wow it was as easy as that right if we know where the origin is and we know the angle we know the length we can calculate where the Bob is and if we understand that the angular acceleration of the pendulum is equal to the force of gravity times sign of that angle and we were able to derive that formula of the diagram then we can just put that right here in our code and we're good to go now so this was a little example of just kind of like whipping it together and draw and I guess actually I want to make a point here which is that um and this is certainly how I work although there's lots of different ways of working and farbe it for me to suggest that this is the best by any means but as you can see we didn't get ourselves kind of lost in objectoriented programming right now we just kind of have this main sketch and this main program we kind of set up and draw we knew we need a bunch of variables we're kind of working out we have the pendulum working now I'm not going to in this video take the next 10 minutes to move everything into an object and build that object I kind of have that preset for you but this is you know this is often a good way to work kind of work out your you know work out everything in just kind of a raw and a messy way in in the main Tab and then once you've got the functionality refactor and build it into a class and so what I'm just going to show you now is if you're following along there is an example in oh I don't want to um I don't want the app store right now um there is this particular example which we can see has a pendulum object the pendulum object the Constructor takes two things it's where is the origin and how long is the arm and then you can see in draw all we're doing is saying P.O run all your simulation stuff we've actually added a few features in this example you can click on the pendulum and move it um so this is kind of a uh you know this is just the objectoriented version but you can see that everything that we worked out is all right here in the update function so in the update function we have a constant for Gravity we have the formula for angular acceleration angular acceleration goes into the velocity the velocity is dampened then the velocity then angle changes by the velocity so everything we worked out is here now in the pendulum's update function the one thing I should say is there's one extra thing which is that we divided by R the angular acceleration is affected by how long that arm is and this makes the the pendulum feel a bit more realistic I'll include some links to other physics discussions of pendulums but you can see that now if I make the pendulum arm really short it kind of swings much faster than if I made the pendulum arm really long and if I grab it you can see I let it swing there's a much sort of slower uh acceleration there because the short of the if we're the the acceleration is inversely proportional to the length of the arm so that's one little addition to this example that makes the pendulum feel a bit more realistic so um I'll give you a couple I have a couple EXC ideas which literally just occurred to me now well one of them occurred to me now and the other I guess I had already thought of but um hold on I just I don't know why I feel the need to put this back to where it was 175 um but there's a couple things so one thing you might try to do is if you remember I think in the first oscillation video uh we we looked at uh this uh other video there was a video in a video and it was very um what's that movie I don't know why I'm trying leca and it has nothing to do with anything edit cut okay and we're back and I didn't just talk about that but I did cuz no one's editing this um uh you know where there's levels of Dreams oh my God just stop go to the next video okay the exercise here's an exercise um try to create a whole bunch of pendulums in a row all across the top of a sketch perhaps start them all at slightly different offsets from each other I don't know give them all slightly different arm lengths give them all slightly different starting angles there's lots of ways you could create some type of really interesting um kind of multiple oscill pattern by doing that another thing you could do is put two pendulums together right uh what if the end of one pendulum is the beginning of another and so on and so forth now here's the thing this is what's called a double pendulum and simulating a double pendulum involves all sorts of uncomfortable and math that I don't even I don't even I mean I'm going to pull up that web page and I'm going to have to go sit down for a while and drink I don't some orange juice or something because I get a little woozy but um so you could look into sort of real double pendulum simulation and you'll find pages on Wikipedia and wolf from math world and all that sort of stuff but one thing you could do just as kind of a little experiment is see what happens if just you use the fact that this pendulum has a bob P vector and this pendulum has an origin P Vector what if you make those values always the same so at least they're sort of connected not they won't be connected in the physics way but they will be connected just in the fact that the code always sets those locations equal what types of effects could you get through that so um so those are some some ideas that you might try with this pendulum stuff and someday I'm going to go and make answers to all these exercises that I keep saying um and if you really want one if you send me an email it'll sort of push me to do that at least for this one and I'll put them in some open source repository for everyone to see okay so that I think this wasn't so bad I was a little anxious about this pendulum stuff but I think we did okay there's some improvements here um but in the next video we're going to look at Springs which is just another case study right we're going to say hey pendulums hey Springs these are two examples you know we don't need pendulums and springs in all of our sketches but these are two examples of kind of working out a physics system understanding the math behind it and making it go okay I need to find a button to shut this off now
