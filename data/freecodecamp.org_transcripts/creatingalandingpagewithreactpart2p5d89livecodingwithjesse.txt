00:02 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:04 - with Jessie I'm Jessie and today we're
00:07 - getting you want to try to finish that
00:08 - page that we started on Monday and
00:12 - before we get started I just want to
00:15 - take a minute maybe not even a minute to
00:18 - explain what the stream is about because
00:20 - there is a little bit of confusion that
00:23 - came out in the comments section of
00:24 - Monday's video so I think I've I've
00:29 - gotten so used to streaming and we have
00:31 - a lot of regulars that I've kind of
00:33 - stopped explaining what the stream is
00:36 - about him I do it occasionally but not
00:38 - regularly so especially for everyone
00:41 - who's new in this stream it's it's not
00:46 - exactly a tutorial although I do my best
00:49 - to explain things what the stream is all
00:52 - about is just giving you a glimpse into
00:55 - what I do as a front-end developer at a
00:59 - university so I what I show you is
01:02 - entirely unrehearsed it's what I need to
01:06 - do for that day at my job so we jump in
01:09 - we're in the middle of a project it's
01:13 - just wherever I leave off at and we work
01:18 - how I would normally work so that means
01:21 - I won't start from scratch or take some
01:23 - take you through step by step if we can
01:25 - copy and paste from somewhere else to
01:27 - save time we'll do that so if you want
01:32 - some more explanation if I don't give a
01:34 - good enough explanation you feel free to
01:36 - ask in the live chat but you know
01:40 - sometimes I I won't go step by step that
01:42 - you you couldn't necessarily just follow
01:44 - one stream and really be able to go and
01:47 - do it on your own without maybe checking
01:51 - out the code yourself and running
01:53 - through it so if you're still interested
01:55 - in watching after that then we're gonna
02:01 - get started and I I really think there
02:06 - are a lot of great pre-recorded
02:09 - tutorials out there and that's part of
02:12 - the reason why one
02:13 - to do my streams like this I wanted to
02:16 - do live and I want to do just how I
02:20 - normally do things because that's I
02:23 - that's what's unique about what I'm
02:25 - doing I I really appreciate all the
02:31 - tutorials but one thing that happened to
02:33 - me when I was getting started is that it
02:35 - led me to think that I wasn't quite as
02:37 - good which I'm sure I wasn't as good as
02:40 - those people but it's unrealistic and it
02:43 - was unrealistic for me to base how good
02:46 - I was on pre recorded edited tutorials
02:49 - right so I just want to let everybody
02:52 - see I'm a real developer right so and
02:57 - basically I get paid to write code and
03:00 - build things so I mess up all the time
03:04 - I'm not perfect I misspell things I
03:08 - caused bugs I fix bugs right so that's
03:13 - the value of this stream now on top of
03:17 - that it's really collaborative so you
03:18 - all give me ideas and encode and we try
03:23 - things and sometimes it doesn't work but
03:25 - you know you all get to see that and go
03:28 - through that with me so anyway I'm gonna
03:35 - try my best to go through a shorter
03:37 - explanation than I just did right now at
03:40 - the beginning of every stream so that
03:42 - way new people are watching especially
03:44 - people maybe you just watch the
03:45 - pre-recorded video and they just stick
03:48 - around for the first minute you know
03:50 - they won't be confused okay
03:58 - where's my berries okay so this is what
04:03 - I was working on just to bring you up to
04:07 - date on the changes since Monday I end
04:10 - up not streaming Tuesday or Wednesday
04:15 - because I was working from home last
04:17 - time I tried to see him from home the
04:19 - quality was was bad so I had to do some
04:22 - boring stuff anyway that wouldn't have
04:24 - made for good stream so I figured I'll
04:25 - just wait and I'll stream from the
04:29 - office today so here's what I've done my
04:34 - boss went through this menu so let me
04:38 - show you visually what this looks like I
04:41 - don't need this right now I don't need
04:44 - this right now
04:46 - don't sit okay so we have this menu oops
04:53 - that's not it
04:54 - there we go all right so we have this
04:58 - menu here and so all the information for
05:04 - this menu and all the dropdowns and
05:06 - everything are contained in in this file
05:10 - this drawer menu j/s right and we can
05:13 - see it's just a collection of constants
05:16 - that we export and each constant is an
05:21 - array so it's an array of objects so we
05:26 - can loop through all those objects you
05:28 - know use map filter you know whatever
05:30 - you want on these objects now each one
05:35 - of these constants corresponds to a
05:38 - section in the menu right so my boss
05:45 - went through all those and significantly
05:49 - decreased the number of items in there
05:51 - and even changed some items so some
05:53 - items are completely different they
05:56 - weren't in there before so what I've
05:58 - done is I've gone through and I made a
06:00 - copy of the original menu just in case
06:03 - my boss changes his mind or we needed to
06:06 - add things back in so made a copy of it
06:10 - and that's drum and you long
06:12 - Jaso you'll notice an extra file there
06:14 - in the data folder if you want to see
06:17 - the code for yourself the link is in the
06:19 - description so please feel free to check
06:21 - that out use it for whatever you want to
06:23 - for whatever you want to use it for so
06:27 - this is the the new menu stuff and what
06:33 - I've done is at least got the text in
06:36 - there so some of these items here at the
06:38 - bottom don't have the correct links yet
06:40 - I need to fill that out but at least we
06:42 - can see and my boss can see what the new
06:45 - menu looks like and yeah much much
06:51 - shorter so if you can believe it it's
06:54 - much shorter so that's what I've been
06:58 - working on mostly I've done a lot of
07:01 - other stuff with things on the WordPress
07:03 - side of side of it
07:05 - cleaning up data and generally getting
07:10 - routes to work with that server j/s file
07:13 - so that's what's new but today we're
07:16 - gonna go back to actually yeah I don't
07:20 - want to close that out because I'm gonna
07:21 - go back to this one I'm done so let's
07:24 - find those pages we were working on so
07:28 - we were working on this admissions j/s
07:31 - and you can see we for right now we're
07:34 - just kind of really sloppily hard coding
07:36 - a lot of stuff just to see how it looks
07:38 - on the page before we break it out into
07:40 - components so Phoenix you're on time
07:47 - Phoenix was worried about in the
07:48 - intellect only on time I'm just kind of
07:52 - explaining what I've done the last few
07:54 - days in this project so let's let's do a
07:59 - few things one I'm gonna start up and
08:01 - grukk so and rock will allow you all to
08:05 - run what I'm running locally on your
08:08 - computer in your browser and you'll be
08:12 - able to inspect it my dev tools just
08:14 - like you were running it locally okay so
08:17 - I just pasted that link into the live
08:20 - chat so if you click it and it doesn't
08:23 - take you the right place then try to
08:24 - copy and paste
08:25 - that occasionally there's an issue in
08:27 - with links in the chat window all right
08:31 - so that's ready you don't have to be on
08:34 - the same page with me either you can
08:35 - click around try things out if you see
08:37 - something really crazy happening let me
08:39 - know about it
08:40 - you can let me know in the stream or
08:42 - even better create an issue on github
08:44 - with a screenshot or something so we
08:50 - have that ready and we need to actually
08:54 - go to that page as we can see what we're
08:56 - doing so I think it's admissions great
09:01 - so here's what we have so far we have
09:05 - this here a section which will most
09:06 - likely have a different image in the
09:09 - background this is the same image we're
09:10 - using on the home page we cut down the
09:13 - size of the hero section just to see how
09:14 - it looks we may or may not change the
09:17 - size and we'll probably change this text
09:22 - these are just some kind of placeholders
09:26 - so these will end up being like
09:29 - testimonials from from former students
09:32 - and it'll be about the same structure
09:37 - but we do want to try to keep these all
09:39 - the same height so that's one thing that
09:40 - will change and then we have this
09:43 - section here that I had thought maybe we
09:46 - could list out all the majors that we
09:49 - offer if we break out in categories and
09:51 - it would look ok so what we've done is
09:54 - just very basically laid it out just to
09:57 - get some visual like is this even doable
10:00 - will this look terrible or not so I
10:02 - think what we can do for this section is
10:06 - actually make this a component so that
10:11 - we can start to put in some data we can
10:15 - we could actually pull in we may be able
10:21 - to pull in a list of all the majors
10:27 - I don't know we probably will have to
10:30 - make that list though because I don't
10:31 - think it exists right now in in a format
10:35 - in WordPress that we can work with yeah
10:40 - so well I'll have to think about that
10:43 - but that's one thing we may get to today
10:46 - and then we need all this is just kind
10:49 - of run over from what we copy and pasted
10:52 - before so this is all gonna change we
10:54 - just left it around for easy copy and
10:56 - paste all right but let's let's get rid
11:01 - of some of this then because now we've
11:03 - gotten down to the point where I think
11:04 - we should start changing that up okay
11:07 - and I see some some action there in the
11:09 - live chat so I have this timer that I'm
11:13 - about to start when this 25 minutes is
11:17 - up I'm gonna go back to the live chat
11:18 - and I'm gonna answer all your questions
11:20 - I'm gonna read your comments and then
11:24 - we'll go back to code and then we'll
11:26 - take a break so I'll try to go back and
11:28 - forth so if you did ask something just
11:31 - hold on I will get to it if you can't
11:33 - stick around for me to answer it you can
11:35 - always watch the recording later on and
11:37 - I'll try to answer it you know when I
11:39 - get time later on in the stream let's
11:44 - see I did see one question is emselves
11:46 - how long do these streams last at least
11:50 - an hour usually sometimes more okay all
11:58 - right yeah so let's get rid of I just
12:01 - want to get rid of all this stuff and
12:02 - just have it have it clear cuz this
12:04 - components huge and I just don't really
12:07 - want to scroll around any more with it
12:10 - so I'm gonna start here I guess at this
12:12 - masonry yeah it was started at this
12:17 - masonry component
12:23 - it did make it easier to leave it all in
12:25 - because now that we did that we're gonna
12:27 - have to take some of this stuff up or
12:31 - else we're gonna get errors there we go
12:41 - okay we may end up adding some of that
12:44 - stuff back in alright there we are okay
12:52 - and I did have let me bring up my my
12:57 - really rudimentary sketch so that we all
13:03 - can see it again I need to refresh my
13:05 - memory on what I sketched out for how
13:06 - this page is gonna look okay
13:15 - so let's
13:25 - okay
13:30 - okay
13:31 - let's try to zoom in here we are okay so
13:35 - we have basically these sections plus
13:41 - our testimonials that I kind of added in
13:44 - after the fact we don't need the online
13:48 - this was a sketch for a slightly
13:50 - different page but it's similar enough
13:52 - that we just kind of reusing this sketch
13:54 - so I guess what we could do now is maybe
13:57 - include how to apply section here I
14:01 - think if we if we put in a how to apply
14:04 - section and maybe leave in a section for
14:10 - let's get rid of these so let's let's
14:16 - leave
14:17 - maybe this section just as an example of
14:20 - you know what what could be done maybe
14:24 - I'll ask my boss to fill in some content
14:26 - there and then we'll just we'll add in a
14:29 - section like we see here where we can
14:33 - have how to apply and we'll just throw
14:36 - kind of this stuff in there then we can
14:39 - I can let my boss see it I'll send him a
14:41 - link
14:41 - he can think up all right what content
14:43 - are we gonna put there and then we can
14:44 - go back to it and maybe adjust it so
14:50 - it's funny my boss asked me about it was
14:53 - a different page but it's the same
14:54 - concept he asked me earlier he said what
14:56 - what's his page gonna look like I want
14:58 - to know what it's gonna look like before
15:00 - I think about what content is gonna have
15:02 - and I said well I was waiting to see
15:04 - what content we're gonna have before I
15:06 - figure out what its gonna look like so
15:10 - we have a back and forth with that the
15:14 - design is very fluid alright let's get
15:19 - to it
15:19 - so let's take out yeah
15:28 - it'll be nice when we break this out
15:30 - into a component way that's scrolling
15:33 - let's break out our vision and we're
15:44 - just going to keep this tech section and
15:50 - this nib is just kind of hanging out
15:52 - here not doing anything huh I must have
15:58 - accidentally oops you know what maybe I
16:04 - think my editor automatically did that
16:06 - since there was no content in it so that
16:10 - makes sense now Dave so within this div
16:13 - let's just let's grab what we did here
16:15 - and then just modify it I think it'll be
16:17 - a lot easier to do it like that so let's
16:19 - take this entire grid container
16:22 - component and put it in here inside of
16:30 - this content container which actually we
16:34 - can we can just remove this div because
16:36 - we already added the content container
16:38 - class on to this grid item so that's
16:42 - nice just get rid of that and what we've
16:47 - done here we can remove a bit so if you
16:51 - remember on Monday we added in some
16:53 - empty grids so that we could get this
16:56 - kind of gap here so we'll take those out
17:00 - I don't need those anymore
17:09 - what did I grab did I grab too much
17:20 - is it at
17:25 - there it is okay so we'll take those out
17:28 - and we only need three sections so let's
17:33 - remove the rest yeah we are okay so I
17:39 - already like these sections how they're
17:41 - set up so on extra small screen it'll
17:46 - take up 12 out of 12 columns across and
17:49 - on a small screen and up it will take up
17:53 - 4 out of 12 columns so that means we can
17:58 - have three items side by side and I do
18:02 - want to remove all of this stuff so to
18:09 - get rid of that and then inside of there
18:12 - for now let's just create let's just
18:18 - create a header tag for now so we'll
18:20 - make these H threes and see how that
18:22 - looks
18:23 - and I'm just gonna add a text
18:28 - placeholder right there whoops
18:31 - three can't type there we are
18:36 - okay so this will end up being our steps
18:39 - to apply where why would it I have there
18:44 - there we go application transcripts and
18:48 - letters of recommendation okay
18:56 - an application transcripts
19:12 - that is a recommendation all right let's
19:17 - see how that looks
19:18 - all right obviously pretty plain let's
19:42 - it's add a little styling here we could
19:47 - probably use some styling here as well
19:48 - so let's add some styling to this grid
19:52 - container yeah
20:06 - so we have our Styles here and you know
20:09 - what I'm gonna we had decided a while
20:11 - back that we were gonna move our Styles
20:13 - to the bottom or we were at least going
20:16 - to try that
20:18 - the reason being we can then if we move
20:22 - our styles to the bottom when
20:25 - immediately when when someone comes
20:27 - especially someone new opens this this
20:31 - file they can immediately see what this
20:34 - components all about instead of seeing a
20:38 - long list of styles so I think it's just
20:41 - a nicer experience if you're new to the
20:44 - component so if we just move them down
20:46 - here they'll work in same same way they
20:50 - normally work but now they're not kind
20:54 - of blocking the view of the of the
20:56 - component especially when we get a lot
20:58 - of styles like we do here I think it
21:01 - just it looks a lot nicer to put them at
21:04 - the bottom okay so content container
21:09 - right now we we're giving it a top and
21:12 - bottom margin of zero but I think I want
21:17 - to increase that and give it just a
21:20 - little margin so let's just try 16
21:25 - pixels for now
21:32 - it's one of little separation so we just
21:34 - have a little bit up probably want to go
21:36 - bigger than that
21:38 - that seems let's let's double it let's
21:41 - try 32 pixels okay
21:48 - a little better a little better
21:51 - some things I'm noticing here that
21:53 - definitely need to change this h3 stuff
21:56 - is just it's not the right font and it's
22:02 - way too small
22:03 - I don't know what's going on there I I
22:08 - don't understand why it's not the right
22:10 - font I thought we were automatically
22:13 - making everything use Roboto so let's
22:19 - check that out
22:19 - what we are bringing in some CSS maybe
22:27 - maybe not
22:34 - hmm
22:39 - I wonder if we didn't bring in any CSS
22:43 - files for this it looks like we didn't
22:46 - okay
23:00 - okay
23:09 - I'm just wondering if we can import an
23:11 - existing CSS file without messing up the
23:15 - Styles too much I'm gonna try it so
23:19 - let's check out our CSS files don't want
23:25 - to do it like this I I don't think I
23:32 - want to do it like this but we may have
23:34 - to because we are eventually we are
23:37 - gonna be bringing in my concern is this
23:42 - when we bring in content from WordPress
23:47 - sometimes we want that content to be
23:49 - styled like there could potentially be
23:51 - HTML tags that we're bringing in we
23:54 - can't directly style them like we're
23:57 - doing here right because we we won't
24:00 - even see those components we can't put a
24:02 - class on them so if we have this
24:04 - external stylesheet that could select
24:07 - things like an h3 that's inside of you
24:12 - know a div and it's all living in
24:14 - WordPress and not here that that's why
24:18 - we're using external style sheets as
24:20 - well as we develop our data more in
24:24 - WordPress we should need to rely less
24:27 - and less on them but I don't think we're
24:28 - ever going to be able to completely get
24:30 - rid of them so if you want to learn more
24:33 - about that maybe check out some of the
24:35 - previous streams as to why we're doing
24:38 - some things that maybe we wouldn't
24:39 - normally do if this was just straight-up
24:41 - react and we had total control over all
24:44 - the the data coming in so let's find our
24:52 - Styles here
24:55 - I believe our page CSS and let's let's
24:59 - move this over here so we can see both
25:00 - let me know if if this font is too small
25:03 - as well
25:07 - so what I'm looking for okay Maine has
25:11 - the font family of Roboto do we even
25:14 - have Maine here I don't think we do
25:21 - let's check out check out another page
25:28 - where we're probably using this all
25:35 - right hjs
25:45 - you know maybe we we do have Maine
25:47 - happening somewhere yep okay all right I
25:53 - see so are kind of our wrapper around
25:57 - everything does have this main tag
26:12 - if if we put a link to our page CSS here
26:17 - and have it apply everywhere that may be
26:21 - the best way to go and then we'll try
26:24 - our best to make sure that this file
26:26 - stays really small
26:43 - I'm here we can get rid of some of these
26:45 - right now
26:53 - could definitely get rid of CV link
27:03 - okay
27:09 - all right yelling I'm thinking is maybe
27:12 - material I already has some way to do
27:15 - this and I just don't know so I'm gonna
27:17 - check this it's a few s theme there we
27:27 - are okay so I'm just checking to see
27:29 - where we're importing our theme from so
27:31 - we do have this fu s theme and the lib
27:35 - folder let's check that out
27:39 - okay so for now it's gonna be a lot
27:46 - easier for me to just do normal CSS
27:49 - it'll probably be a lot easier if y'all
27:51 - to understand as well but there is a way
27:54 - we could probably style a lot of this
27:56 - through here and this may end up being
27:58 - the best way to do it
28:00 - but for now since we kind of need to
28:04 - mess around with the Styles a lot and
28:06 - get them right I'm just gonna go with
28:09 - get old CSS and what we're gonna do is
28:14 - whoops some of this over here and then
28:18 - open up that page dot J s this is kind
28:23 - of our default and where we we're gonna
28:27 - take this we're gonna take it out of
28:30 - here and we're gonna link it here yeah
28:38 - so we're gonna like to here instead what
28:41 - we're gonna have to do is really be
28:44 - careful though and make sure that this
28:50 - isn't causing conflicts you know in our
28:53 - in our other pages so you'll see how it
28:59 - is we'll also need to make sure we
29:01 - remove this this link from all the files
29:05 - which actually can we do that let's see
29:10 - if we can do that right now
29:16 - mmm-hmm and I won't let us search for
29:21 - that whole thing
29:22 - all right cool thought it was worth a
29:24 - shot so not right now but at some point
29:28 - someone I have to go through and remove
29:31 - all these so it'll try end up being me
29:34 - but some of these files will have that
29:39 - same link we don't want to load it twice
29:40 - right but now we're gonna be loading it
29:43 - globally so let's see if any changes
29:45 - have happened oh yeah admissions let's
29:55 - see what's happening uh okay the font is
30:00 - definitely different right our font is
30:02 - Roboto let's check out everything else
30:06 - okay everything else looks fine it looks
30:09 - the same I don't know if any of you
30:11 - notice any other differences but that
30:13 - this looks good to me
30:17 - all right great so that takes care of
30:22 - that and that now gives us a way to add
30:25 - styles globally
30:33 - all right so let's get to work on this
30:37 - and this I wonder if there's icons that
30:46 - we could use if anybody thinks of any
30:55 - material icons so icons that normally go
31:00 - with material design that would work for
31:02 - these three things application
31:04 - transcript and letters of recommendation
31:05 - let me know in the chat because that
31:09 - might be a good place to use icons so I
31:13 - mean obviously if we had a letter icon
31:16 - that would probably work there
31:17 - transcripts I don't know maybe maybe
31:20 - something like a page you know I don't
31:25 - know what to do for application but
31:27 - maybe you have some icons and then of
31:31 - course we're gonna add in links
31:43 - and I kind of think that this section
31:45 - might be better off in a different
31:50 - different place
31:54 - I'll leave it for now see you my boss
31:56 - Thanks let's grab these and fix these
32:01 - right because that's that needs to be
32:05 - done we need to break these out new
32:07 - component and this is I really want to
32:11 - see the actual text here
32:20 - all right so whenever we make a new
32:24 - component I think the best way to do it
32:26 - is just copy the most similar component
32:30 - that we already have and try to use that
32:33 - so let's close out some of these things
32:36 - we'll leave this up because we're like
32:38 - we might change this
32:42 - and all right we have a sample schedule
32:46 - component here let's just grab this and
32:50 - we use this as the basis for new
32:54 - components where we go in our components
32:55 - folder here and I'll just click in there
32:58 - and make this list which we call this
33:19 - I'm gonna call it header list dodge is
33:22 - because we are gonna have a header on
33:25 - our list so make sense 50 header list
33:30 - all right so let's paste this in here
33:35 - and this is going to be may end up being
33:40 - useful because we already have some some
33:42 - mock data here so we may be able to just
33:45 - use some of this to see if we can get
33:50 - this to work for now
33:51 - you'll see how it goes probably have to
33:56 - copy and paste it out so we can keep so
34:05 - we can keep and we need to get rid of
34:16 - for now let's get rid of pretty much
34:23 - everything yeah we get rid of everything
34:30 - and just start fresh and this is what
34:34 - we're gonna grab you might think like
34:39 - what's the point if you just deleted
34:41 - everything but like this stuff this
34:45 - stuff saves us from having to type it
34:48 - out again we're gonna name this after
34:51 - our component which is header header
34:56 - list and I messed up when I named this
34:59 - because normally we name components with
35:05 - capitals starting with a capital letter
35:12 - okay all right so it's complaining here
35:18 - about indentation it is complaining here
35:20 - about the way we're styling this which
35:25 - makes sense let's get rid of our tabs
35:28 - and let's get rid of our grid
35:40 - let's get rid of this UUID for now we
35:45 - can always bring it back if we need it
35:48 - and we're gonna keep some of this list
35:52 - styling and apply them here but we can
35:59 - also move in our styles from here which
36:02 - we move down here so what we need to
36:05 - bring in then is our our list our list
36:08 - header major list item
36:24 - there we are all down here oops yeah
36:36 - so we can I'm gonna keep these in here
36:40 - right now do I need to let's just take a
36:43 - mom because eventually we're not we're
36:45 - not gonna need these everything will be
36:46 - in this this other component so let's
36:49 - pull these put these in here for now you
36:54 - may be able to remove some of this as
36:55 - well because some of these were for
36:59 - slightly different use although it's a
37:03 - list with a header again yeah see it's
37:10 - oh we already had it oh okay I didn't
37:16 - realize we had just repeated those okay
37:24 - well and we can get rid of this we you
37:29 - know what we may be able to use the same
37:31 - component for our sample schedule and in
37:35 - here that would be nice trying to make
37:38 - components as reusable as possible is
37:40 - always good okay let's set the
37:44 - five-minute time Rick this timer just
37:46 - went out and I'm gonna go talk to the
37:49 - live chat try to answer as many
37:51 - questions as I can in five minutes
37:54 - Harvin asked if this is related python
37:57 - no this is JavaScript is em asked what
38:04 - we're using for back-end nodejs although
38:07 - we do have content management coming
38:08 - from WordPress so we have done a little
38:10 - PHP as well misssara says did you use
38:17 - sequel eyes or have you taken data from
38:20 - WordPress using graph QL we're using
38:23 - graph QL and also the WordPress REST API
38:26 - in some places
38:35 - Blake's here Michael's here hey how's it
38:37 - going
38:40 - as M says do you use some third-party
38:43 - software to generate your objects during
38:45 - development no I do not but that
38:51 - probably wouldn't be a bad idea
38:53 - Oh Sean says is this new livestream
39:01 - because I'm having this feeling that it
39:04 - has been aired before I don't know I
39:07 - don't know maybe maybe I definitely
39:10 - repeat myself a lot so me but I'm really
39:14 - here you'll need to hold up the date on
39:17 - my phone I will prove it look at this
39:23 - July 19th I guess it's not really
39:29 - focusing let's see
39:39 - michael says michael le mu says could
39:43 - you post the video after live chat yes
39:44 - the all the all the videos from the
39:47 - streams are posted pretty much
39:50 - immediately after the stream is over it
39:52 - may take a minute or so to process but
39:54 - they are available actually if you want
39:58 - to watch the video recording I recommend
40:01 - watching it on like two times speed I
40:04 - think it's it goes a lot faster you can
40:07 - still understand what I'm saying
40:08 - and it makes me look really good because
40:11 - I solve problems in half the time and I
40:13 - tight fast so that's how I watch me if I
40:17 - watch the stream
40:28 - Oh Sean says Jessi worked on a
40:30 - similar-looking site months before yep
40:32 - it's still the same site still working
40:35 - on it
40:37 - definitely the development for this site
40:40 - has gone on significantly longer than I
40:43 - had planned originally Sahil says I got
40:48 - my first job last week free code camp
40:50 - was really helpful Thanks well you're
40:52 - you're well on behalf of free code camp
40:54 - you're welcome I don't know how helpful
40:56 - I was individually maybe not at all but
40:58 - I really excited for you about your job
41:02 - please you know if you can you know come
41:05 - back to the stream and let us know like
41:08 - how your jobs go on it will cool stuff
41:10 - you're working on if you can
41:23 - Phoenix says hey Jesse our site has no
41:26 - favicon any plans on adding it yeah for
41:29 - sure
41:31 - every time I notice it I I'm doing
41:35 - something else so yeah I would
41:36 - definitely need that in there I thought
41:40 - I added one somewhere
41:42 - I just never linked it up so I think the
41:45 - file exists somewhere in all of this
41:49 - stuff
42:00 - as M says do you ever use alternative
42:02 - styling solutions when working with
42:03 - material you I like using styled
42:05 - components or some elements that don't
42:07 - need to reference the thing I haven't
42:09 - used styled components with material UI
42:11 - I've used them on on other projects but
42:16 - we we generally try to try out a variety
42:19 - of of things so I'm open to trying a lot
42:24 - of different things tell you the truth
42:27 - last time you solid components it was a
42:29 - little weird for me I don't want to make
42:32 - a judgment about style components until
42:34 - I've used them more and can get used to
42:35 - them but my first impression was I was a
42:39 - little thrown off I'm I could understand
42:41 - what's going on but it was it would seem
42:44 - weird to me the way everything was
42:46 - working so like I said I don't want to
42:49 - make a quick judgment unless I really
42:52 - give it a shot I feel like I haven't
42:54 - given it a fair chance yet so I'd like
42:56 - to work with them on a different project
42:58 - though I don't really want to try we're
43:00 - so close to the end here I don't want to
43:03 - start it now but maybe on a future
43:05 - project we can we can use it on mpg says
43:17 - sometimes a bit confuses me to customize
43:20 - some to your UI elements sometimes not
43:22 - working when we just controlled it by
43:24 - with style yet their material I it's it
43:29 - is a little tricky sometimes and things
43:31 - change with depending on what version
43:35 - you're using so overall I think it does
43:38 - help but definitely had to modify things
43:44 - Michael says you watch your own streams
43:47 - I'm sure I could not I'm not sure I
43:49 - could watch myself yeah it took a while
43:51 - to get used to but mainly I watched my
43:54 - own streams whenever I need to remember
43:56 - how I did something and then they're
43:59 - really helpful because I can a lot of
44:03 - times when I'm done with the project I
44:06 - don't go back and revisit it for a while
44:07 - and I forget things that I did and
44:10 - during the project I just remember
44:12 - things you know because you're doing it
44:15 - every day but after a month or so you
44:17 - forget so I need I go back in i rewatch
44:19 - how i did it it saves me a lot of time
44:24 - okay let's my timer went off so let me
44:33 - start another session will do at least
44:35 - one more Pomodoro session and and then
44:38 - maybe QA we'll see how this it's still
44:41 - kind of early so I might get in three
44:43 - Pomodoro sessions but we'll see how that
44:47 - is the really really long streams like
44:50 - the two-hour long shrimps take a lot out
44:52 - of me so we'll see I don't know if I if
44:55 - I'm down for that rate right now
45:06 - where was that oh I just brought the
45:10 - styles over okay so we brought these
45:12 - styles over and now we need to let's
45:18 - let's pull some of this over actually
45:20 - because this already has the yeah this
45:25 - already has things in here
45:38 - okay yeah this is good we'll bring this
45:41 - in
45:47 - yeah
45:56 - okay that's gonna save us some time so
46:00 - what we need to do though it's it's
46:04 - actually it's gonna be a little tricky
46:06 - to try to use this component in both
46:10 - cases because of the way I set up this
46:13 - data well this I mean this is how it was
46:15 - coming out of WordPress so for now I'm
46:19 - gonna make this work for the admissions
46:21 - page and then maybe sometime later I'll
46:24 - try to make it work on you know for the
46:28 - sample schedule since this sample
46:29 - schedule is already working as intended
46:31 - I'm not gonna mess with it right now but
46:34 - that's like I think a potentially good
46:37 - refactor that'll save a few lines okay
46:42 - so what we want to do we're not worried
46:46 - about the year
46:54 - the hearts value
47:00 - okay we don't need this at all this
47:02 - handle change or the state value we also
47:07 - don't need you don't need this okay and
47:13 - we're gonna have our styles of fine of
47:17 - course let's change this up alright so
47:26 - we're gonna get the data in and we will
47:30 - have a header and then course they're
47:36 - not courses majors but let's try to make
47:39 - it as generic as possible so we can
47:42 - definitely say here that this is going
47:46 - to be the header and so the text for
47:49 - this let's let's call this data dot
47:53 - header and then let's let's call this
48:01 - let's go data items map and then instead
48:08 - of course we'll call this item
48:19 - okay I for our key I think we can just
48:26 - use item you know what let's see let's
48:31 - just use this will bring this back this
48:33 - is a little bit safer to use so in in
48:36 - react when your your mapping over
48:38 - something and adding you know multiple
48:40 - components to the page you need to have
48:42 - a unique key so sometimes you can just
48:46 - grab some of the data you're bringing in
48:48 - as long as it's unique but in this case
48:53 - it's some cases it's possible that what
48:56 - you pull in may not be unique and in
48:58 - that case we're going to use this this
49:00 - UUID to just give us unique values okay
49:05 - so it's just gonna make random numbers
49:06 - and put it in there so let's use that
49:09 - and then we don't have to worry about it
49:10 - I don't think it'll be a problem I think
49:13 - every one of these will be unique but
49:14 - just in case we're gonna use that okay
49:20 - so the data this data is actually gonna
49:27 - live for now over here in admissions
49:33 - so let's yeah let's put it down here so
49:38 - what we need for our data let's just
49:43 - call this we call it data let's give it
49:47 - a little better name here maybe majors
49:58 - yeah we'll call it majors oops
50:04 - and majors is going to be an array of
50:10 - objects so yeah it's gonna be array of
50:17 - objects each object is going to have a
50:22 - header and so let's just say for now
50:32 - business so you want business and then
50:41 - it's gonna have
50:49 - Magers
50:59 - I'm just gonna call this majors array
51:01 - because I don't want to get this
51:02 - confused so majors and then within here
51:07 - we're also gonna have name and we can
51:16 - have a major said the best way to do it
51:18 - not really right we don't need it to be
51:21 - like that do we
51:33 - let me think about that might be like
51:35 - more complicated than we even need it to
51:37 - be right now so I'm thinking like when
51:42 - we go to loop through this could we we
51:44 - just leave it as an array right you know
51:49 - could I just say accounting economics
52:02 - [Music]
52:03 - I'll go through and put some real ones
52:06 - in here but all right so then over here
52:15 - when we pull this in as data we would
52:19 - say data this entire thing is gonna have
52:24 - to be okay so when data comes in it'll
52:34 - come in as just one one section right so
52:37 - it'll be data dot header and that'll
52:39 - give us business okay so that makes
52:41 - sense then we'll go down here data dot
52:44 - items so maybe we should put items here
53:03 - yeah let's do that and then we can
53:05 - change this back to just say majors all
53:08 - right so that would have change that to
53:10 - items so we can keep it here so major
53:14 - start items equals mmm
53:28 - actually you know what we can make this
53:31 - I mean I've been thinking in my head a
53:35 - lot not talking a lot so let me let me
53:37 - tell you what I've been thinking okay so
53:39 - if we pull in the data like this it's
53:42 - it's gonna be a little bit difficult
53:44 - right because for a data source this
53:47 - name could be different for you know a
53:51 - variety of different things we're going
53:53 - for so that makes this kind of difficult
53:55 - you know to put in here but what if when
53:59 - we actually pass this data as props we
54:02 - pass it as two different props so the
54:04 - first prop is the header the second prop
54:07 - will be the items and then it doesn't
54:09 - matter what this is actually called
54:11 - because we'll pass it in as just an
54:14 - array so when we pass it in then we'll
54:19 - have it it'll just say items
54:24 - all right so items dot map okay we'll
54:29 - just give us item right and so it's a
54:35 - literally it would just be the value of
54:37 - of item okay so I think that's that's
54:42 - better right
54:43 - that seems better to me let me know what
54:46 - y'all think let me know if I'm even
54:49 - making sense at all right now let's see
54:53 - how we broke out props here wow that's a
55:00 - lot of props
55:02 - I just like to copy and paste as much as
55:05 - possible I always have to look at other
55:08 - components to remember where to put
55:10 - things like within what set of
55:13 - parentheses and things do it and that
55:16 - brackets do I need to put this so since
55:18 - that works for this one I'm guessing
55:19 - it'll work over here so let's let's
55:24 - break out some of the props we know
55:27 - we're gonna have to put in here so we're
55:29 - destructuring and then that way we won't
55:30 - have to keep typing this props but I
55:32 - also really like doing this because as
55:35 - soon as you go to a component you know
55:36 - automatically what props are being
55:38 - passed in you don't have to search
55:39 - through through this component okay so
55:44 - we're gonna have the header as a prop
55:48 - right and we'll have the items as a prop
55:53 - okay so now you see the little squiggly
55:55 - lines disappeared from here we no longer
55:58 - need data right because header is just
56:03 - gonna come through as a string right so
56:09 - we can just put header in there all
56:14 - right cool that might be it so we need
56:18 - anything else for now I don't I don't
56:23 - think we do let's get rid of course data
56:26 - as well because we don't need that
56:28 - anymore
56:32 - that was shortened up this component
56:34 - significantly great okay
56:46 - all right not bad a nice small component
56:49 - great okay so let's let's just copy and
56:55 - paste this a few times just to give us
57:00 - some sample data and we'll just change
57:09 - this up I don't even know let's just do
57:16 - two three I don't want to take time to
57:19 - find actual courses right now just put
57:26 - that in there so we know which is which
57:28 - so now cost majors and let's go up here
57:33 - and we're going to add let's see this is
57:44 - gonna be kind of tricky since we have
57:46 - those spacers right hmm
58:12 - this is gonna be difficult what was I
58:15 - thinking
58:19 - all right this can still work it's just
58:21 - gonna be slightly more complicated than
58:23 - I wanted it to be
58:32 - all right well first things first let's
58:35 - just give this a shot
58:50 - all right
59:01 - okay so we're gonna say we're gonna add
59:05 - our curly brackets which takes us into
59:07 - JavaScript right so now we can write
59:09 - JavaScript inside these curly brackets
59:11 - we're gonna say major
59:13 - it wasn't majors yeah majors dot map
59:17 - right we can map over it because majors
59:19 - is an array and we're gonna say we call
59:28 - this list yeah
59:31 - list sounds good so let's say list you
59:36 - would do an arrow function here and then
59:42 - let's pull this in right so we're gonna
59:47 - loop over this and we should be able to
59:54 - say we probably need a key here since
59:57 - this is we're looping over this so the
60:01 - key here could be list dot header right
60:12 - that should be unique and then now
60:17 - inside of here we can do when we call
60:22 - this one header list header list and we
60:27 - need to pass it the props of header
60:30 - header is going to equal list dot header
60:36 - and items is gonna equal list dot items
60:51 - and we need to bring in header list
60:54 - right because we didn't actually import
60:56 - it and what's this
60:59 - import major from major
61:08 - that's weird all right but we're not
61:10 - using it so let's take it out
61:11 - so let's import we're gonna import
61:16 - header header list from and then we're
61:20 - gonna tell it where this lives it lives
61:22 - in the components folder and it's called
61:25 - oh it already did it no I forgot it okay
61:29 - so we had a question a few streams ago
61:33 - about how I should get some plug-in to
61:40 - like automatically add these and
61:42 - evidently I do have it for whatever
61:43 - reason it just didn't work at that
61:45 - particular time but I guess I have it
61:48 - cuz it added editor list for me
61:50 - wonderful
61:52 - so this squiggly line is probably just
61:54 - indentation you have indentation okay so
61:58 - let's check this I think this should
62:03 - work yep should we see what we have
62:11 - classes is not defined
62:14 - did I leave classes in here
62:22 - where's classes not the fun header list
62:25 - 44 that's that's really weird
62:33 - maybe I just didn't save it from the
62:35 - last time yep that's it I didn't save it
62:38 - all right let's see what we have okay
62:39 - cool so write this this is now rendered
62:43 - these out awesome now here's the trick
62:48 - here's the tricky part
62:50 - we need we need these two to render but
62:57 - we need this spacing here or at least I
63:03 - want that spacing
63:16 - so there's there's a couple ways we
63:18 - could do this that I'm thinking right
63:28 - so I guess there's two thing two ways
63:31 - I'm thinking about doing this one way is
63:34 - we have two times that we map through
63:38 - the first time we map through and we get
63:41 - the index and we only get the first
63:46 - three items and then on our other map
63:50 - it's for that index row and we only get
63:52 - two items and we map through inside of
63:55 - here like you know inside of this empty
63:58 - grid component right and one yeah so
64:03 - basically right here where we have these
64:05 - which we can definitely remove these for
64:08 - now all right and that's definitely a
64:16 - possibility the other thing that we
64:18 - could do is have basically go through
64:23 - each grid item so we would leave we
64:29 - wouldn't map over this the grid itself
64:32 - so where we have this majors map so
64:35 - where we have this grid here let me make
64:40 - this a little bit easier to read
64:56 - that was gonna automatically format this
64:59 - for me I guess it's not one sir
65:01 - why is it not going soon
65:09 - all right anyway
65:16 - you potentially we could say we could do
65:18 - a filter and just say if the header like
65:24 - the name of the header equals this then
65:27 - render that now that I think about it
65:29 - two Maps is better than five right there
65:39 - we go I was waiting for it to do that
65:42 - okay yeah so let's let's add in some
65:53 - some more data here still just some test
65:57 - data to do we get this worked out
66:13 - all right so now we have enough data
66:15 - where let's see it rendered all these
66:17 - out right but that's not that's not what
66:24 - we want it's not what we want it to look
66:25 - like
66:28 - so we'll do now is say that list and
66:38 - then we want I as well
66:41 - let's put these in parentheses so what
66:45 - this I should be then is the index right
66:48 - of this this map so our index like zero
66:50 - one two right so we're gonna do this
66:55 - index and then what we're gonna say is
66:59 - we're gonna have to make some some
67:01 - brackets right because we need to do
67:05 - some JavaScript the parens the
67:07 - parentheses
67:09 - they auto return so we don't want to
67:14 - return just yet what we want to say is
67:17 - if I is less than three and Oh actually
67:28 - can we do this as less than three wonder
67:36 - if we can
67:38 - oops
67:58 - it's
68:11 - that's not gonna work shoot okay
68:23 - this is to say if I is less than isn't
68:34 - 3c this will work
68:36 - then whatever turn grade what am I doing
68:41 - wrong
68:41 - Oh
68:52 - yeah there we go
68:57 - what I do here I don't need that huh
69:02 - right in our system
69:10 - now I do need this one I need one two
69:18 - three baby
69:25 - and then I need another one too many
69:28 - going on here alright this is double
69:33 - check I need this outer bracket the
69:35 - outer part needs to be a bracket okay so
69:40 - the outer bracket is here then I need
69:43 - parenthesis then I need a bracket right
69:49 - to cover this one then I need another
69:53 - bracket to cover this one then I need
69:57 - for rent for that this looks terrible
70:02 - what am i doing
70:10 - all right let's see if it works mmm nope
70:15 - what did I do if I is greater than
70:20 - whoops less than there we are
70:23 - Thank You Kenny that actually works all
70:26 - right cool so that works now we just
70:31 - copy this paste it here and just say if
70:39 - I is greater than or equal to three
70:47 - there we go cool all right so that works
70:51 - it's I kind of wish I wouldn't have to
70:59 - do like the exact same maps twice I mean
71:03 - maybe we could if it were more than
71:06 - twice I think about maybe like just
71:08 - extracting this part out I don't want to
71:11 - put the grid in the component because it
71:14 - would be not as reusable right so this
71:22 - is it for now but that works so
71:24 - basically this works and we we cut down
71:27 - a lot right remember yet all this
71:28 - hard-coded stuff and now if we could get
71:33 - data like this in this format from
71:36 - wordpress we don't have to mess with
71:37 - changing this list someone who is in
71:42 - charge of that area could just edit that
71:44 - content so we add a major they can edit
71:47 - themselves so if you take one away
71:48 - whatever they can handle that and then I
71:52 - don't have to manually go back so that's
71:54 - that's always a good thing and let's see
71:57 - okay
71:58 - so that's my timer but I mean we
72:02 - successfully extracted this out into its
72:04 - own component potentially could reuse
72:07 - this as well which is nice and you know
72:09 - we've we've got it to where we're
72:11 - displaying it here so definitely not
72:16 - it's not finished right we're missing
72:19 - lots of content but this may be enough
72:23 - to show
72:24 - boss and say okay given this layout what
72:26 - do you want in these areas right do you
72:32 - you know how do you want to arrange it
72:38 - so yeah generally I tried not to mess
72:41 - around with the like the content of like
72:43 - what's the what's the text gonna be and
72:46 - things like that I try not to mess with
72:47 - that too much I'd rather just handle
72:52 - kind of the code behind that okay well
72:59 - that is my timer so I think now now is
73:03 - actually it was good timing that that
73:05 - went off so I'm not gonna do another
73:07 - Pomodoro session I'm just gonna end with
73:09 - with that with the successful completion
73:11 - of a a new component so always it
73:18 - especially for those of you who are new
73:20 - always remember you know we we do things
73:22 - here we get them done we get them
73:24 - working fully understanding that we
73:28 - could always refactor we could always
73:30 - make improvements right so if this was a
73:33 - tutorial and I was trying to teach you
73:35 - like this is the absolute best way to do
73:37 - it yeah we would do that but it's not
73:39 - it's a real project and we have to say
73:42 - okay will it be the benefit of me
73:44 - refactoring is that benefit great enough
73:47 - to take the time to do it you know given
73:49 - our deadlines so unfortunately the
73:52 - answer to that question most of the time
73:53 - is no it doesn't really make sense if I
73:56 - can remove four lines of code from this
73:57 - component like nobody's gonna care
74:00 - really you know even developers who look
74:03 - at this later on aren't gonna freak
74:04 - about four lines I mean unless I don't
74:07 - know maybe they're really sensitive
74:08 - about that so that's kind of what we're
74:15 - weighing so I would pretty much
74:19 - everything I do I'd always love to have
74:21 - more time to make it better right but we
74:24 - can't always do that so anyway just
74:26 - wanted to give that disclaimer in case
74:28 - some of you're probably thinking like
74:29 - this dude what is this dude doing I
74:32 - would never do it like that
74:34 - which is totally legit or or some of you
74:37 - may be thinking oh okay that's exactly
74:39 - how you should do it no that's just how
74:42 - we are doing it so it works for what we
74:46 - needed to work for right now okay so
74:48 - right now we don't need it to be perfect
74:51 - or even optimal right okay
74:55 - let's commit this so let's check our
75:00 - status see what we've changed like
75:02 - immune admission for this okay so we've
75:06 - actually done a lot so we're gonna do
75:08 - multiple commits here all right so yeah
75:13 - I'm gonna do this because I don't think
75:14 - I've really done multiple commits on the
75:15 - stream I usually just just like add
75:17 - everything so if you've done a lot and
75:20 - then you want to break it out in
75:21 - different commits you can do a get add
75:23 - and then just add a particular file so
75:26 - let's add pages dot page file and let's
75:37 - also we just put a space we could add
75:39 - another one let's add our Pages document
75:41 - dot a s file and did we change our page
75:49 - dot CSS I don't think we changed it what
75:53 - did we change
76:02 - interesting I don't remember changing
76:06 - anything but I guess we'll just add that
76:09 - as well
76:10 - oops static styles page dot CSS okay so
76:23 - those ones are all going to have to do
76:24 - to us moving that page dot CSS up to be
76:28 - global styles so now we're gonna do our
76:33 - yarn CM so yarn cm for us here is a just
76:42 - a little helper to help us write nice
76:44 - commit messages so if you don't have
76:45 - that installed to imagine most people
76:47 - don't then you can just do git commit
76:50 - and do M - a - M and then you can put
76:56 - your commit message right so we'll just
77:02 - say it's a new features so say make page
77:05 - dot CSS a global local CSS file okay
77:18 - as far as I know there are no breaking
77:21 - changes or conflicts with styles so what
77:25 - should happen and so there shouldn't be
77:27 - conflicts is anything that's paid
77:30 - specific would be loaded below so it
77:34 - shouldn't it should override right the
77:36 - cascading part of cascading style sheets
77:39 - CSS should take effect and so it's we
77:43 - should be able to still keep the styles
77:44 - the thing that would be weird is you
77:46 - know if Paige was never loaded and
77:48 - there's something that we don't have a
77:50 - ride so we'll just have to keep an eye
77:51 - out for stuff like that okay great so
77:56 - that's one commit out of the way let's
77:57 - do a git status just to make sure yep
78:00 - see now that those things are no longer
78:02 - there to be added now we can just add
78:06 - everything so we'll do a git add and
78:09 - then just put a space and a dot a period
78:11 - and that adds everything and we'll do
78:13 - our yarn CM again and new feature
78:19 - creates header list component no great
78:29 - thing changes you know it doesn't affect
78:31 - any issues so this will run through all
78:34 - stuff and once it's ready then we'll do
78:36 - a git push and everything we've done
78:38 - today will be available on the git repo
78:40 - our github repo link is in the
78:44 - description you get push
78:53 - awesome okay always recommend ending
78:57 - your day with a get push you should
78:59 - probably push frequently and beginning
79:01 - your day where they get pull keep
79:04 - yourself up to date and then keep the
79:06 - repository up-to-date too if you have a
79:09 - lot of people working on the project you
79:11 - may want to push and pull multiple times
79:13 - throughout the day maybe if you're doing
79:16 - a Pomodoro's cycle like maybe at the
79:19 - beginning and end of every you know
79:21 - Pomodoro session try to push your pool
79:23 - you know whatever you said but it's it's
79:29 - a good practice to do and you can avoid
79:30 - some weird merge conflicts okay I'm
79:38 - gonna go back to the live chat and
79:40 - answer any remaining questions that I
79:42 - didn't get to last time if you have
79:43 - questions please put them in the chat
79:45 - I'm happy to answer questions about
79:47 - anything especially if it's code related
79:49 - it doesn't have to be necessarily
79:51 - related to this particular project
79:53 - though I see julio said hi hey how's it
80:00 - going
80:06 - okay so on mpg says based on your
80:12 - experiences which one would you
80:13 - recommend between bootstrap materialized
80:15 - semantics or other okay so it definitely
80:18 - depends if we're talking just a regular
80:21 - JavaScript site without react bootstrap
80:27 - is really nice if you want that material
80:30 - design style I would go with
80:32 - materialized CSS now if we're talking
80:36 - about a react site I actually like
80:38 - material you why I know there I there
80:41 - are people that I definitely respect as
80:43 - programmers that have a hard time with
80:45 - it but I like it I've gotten used to it
80:49 - I kinda I like the style I know my way
80:51 - around the documentation so for now I'm
80:55 - you know I'm happy with it
80:59 - there are other options but that would
81:04 - be my preference you know I have the
81:06 - most experience with that so I don't
81:09 - know that I'm the best person to make a
81:11 - recommendation since I haven't used a
81:13 - lot of different react UI frameworks in
81:17 - terms of regular JavaScript ones I have
81:19 - used bootstrap and I have used material
81:22 - as CSS I think they're both good and the
81:26 - main difference would be your preference
81:29 - on style because they definitely have
81:32 - different styles
81:45 - Nikki says every time he says let's I
81:47 - here go in my head
81:51 - Phoenix says that's too much pub G bro
81:56 - okay so I I haven't never played pub G
81:59 - or watching you stream so that's that's
82:03 - going over my head I'm assuming that
82:05 - that's they say that in in pub G
82:09 - Michaels Michael criolla says speaking
82:12 - and watching your old streams do you
82:13 - keep notes on what you do each stream so
82:15 - you can jump back quickly if you need to
82:17 - remind yourself I don't keep notes
82:20 - usually I can kind of remember when I
82:25 - did something and then based on the
82:26 - titles I can figure out where I was at
82:28 - but hmm so I threw the yarn it wouldn't
82:41 - be a bad idea to after I do the streams
82:45 - go back and change the titles and
82:46 - descriptions based on what we actually
82:50 - got done because I make the titles and
82:53 - descriptions beforehand and it doesn't
82:56 - always end up the way I think it's going
82:59 - to end up so that's just kind of a time
83:03 - thing like when I'm done with the stream
83:05 - I'm tired usually they have something
83:06 - else going on right after so I don't
83:09 - have a lot of time to edit and then I
83:11 - never go back to it
83:21 - I need to get an intern right that's
83:24 - what I need to get like a YouTube
83:29 - marketing intern or something and have
83:32 - them edit all my stuff we'll see maybe
83:38 - I'll talk to the the marketing
83:40 - department here at the University and
83:42 - see if we can do that
83:50 - on MPG sis usually for working with
83:53 - projects like this how much time or how
83:55 - long does it take to finish it for you
83:58 - this suspense really long
84:03 - I mean most of the reason why this is
84:06 - taking so long is because of the data if
84:09 - I were building this as a brand new site
84:12 - and I didn't have to pull over all kind
84:14 - of data it would have been done a while
84:16 - ago right I spent a long long time
84:19 - bringing over data you know editing the
84:22 - data trying to work with it so that's
84:26 - what's taking a long time so the stream
84:29 - is kind of misleading like the length of
84:31 - it that has been going on because when
84:33 - I'm not streaming most of what I do does
84:37 - not involve react at all or coding it
84:39 - out most of it involves either migrating
84:44 - data or editing that data so it's more
84:51 - like content management which kind of
84:54 - things I don't really enjoy doing that
84:56 - it's pretty boring but so I guess your
85:02 - question it's hard to answer the
85:03 - question but I mean I think what we've
85:07 - been working for this fraud
85:08 - on this project for like six months I
85:10 - mean I think we definitely could have
85:12 - been half the time if this was a new
85:15 - project where we didn't we didn't have
85:21 - all these restrictions and have to do
85:23 - all these workarounds based on what what
85:26 - data we had and things like that
85:32 - let's see Michael creo says it depends
85:35 - on the structure of the data you could
85:36 - do it as theta zero one okay so that
85:40 - must have been when I was figuring out
85:41 - what to what to do
85:48 - Michael creo says which page already has
85:50 - a list of majors we do have it should be
86:01 - there we go academics ug majors has this
86:07 - list of majors so I mean I guess we
86:16 - could pull out majors here from this
86:19 - list the problem is though like this
86:20 - list doesn't break them up into
86:21 - categories but I may be able to if I can
86:32 - decide on categories well actually I'll
86:33 - do see if my boss can decide on
86:36 - categories and then figure out what
86:38 - categories they could be in and then
86:40 - have my student workers enter that data
86:42 - in in in a format that would be better
86:49 - maybe I could maybe I could work
87:09 - let's see which pages Daniel says hola
87:15 - saludos Adeste Mexico so I know what all
87:21 - that is hey Daniel how's it going
87:27 - cannabis places why do you like this and
87:32 - then there's an expletive in there so
87:36 - [Music]
87:38 - Nicky says bracket para colorizer i know
87:43 - i keeps getting recommended to me a lot
87:45 - okay cannabis says this is insane
87:47 - spaghetti code yeah I mean a lot of it
87:53 - is so I mean it's kind of like I said
87:55 - earlier like at this point in it like
87:58 - it's pretty rough when we start to write
88:01 - it you know eventually as we keep going
88:06 - over it you know it gets refactored but
88:09 - you know the thing is you know we get it
88:15 - to a point where it works and you know
88:22 - we try to get the components as small as
88:24 - possible so yeah of course I mean I
88:30 - don't know if cannabis place is still
88:32 - around it seems like they were not happy
88:35 - with the stream I definitely welcome
88:39 - anybody to come a refactor stuff and
88:41 - usually if somebody has a good refactor
88:43 - and a nice pattern for how to do
88:44 - components I stick with it you know
88:46 - throughout the rest of the stream so the
88:49 - way we do things now is is really a it's
88:54 - a development of all your contributions
88:57 - right so little by little we improve and
89:01 - change the way we do things and that
89:03 - just kind of keeps building right so
89:06 - believe it or not this code is way
89:08 - better than you know when I first
89:10 - started streaming a year actually has
89:13 - been longer than a year ago now so
89:17 - definitely I'm under no illusions of
89:19 - thinking my code is
89:21 - perfect I can definitely improve so and
89:23 - I definitely appreciate all your
89:25 - suggestions on you know how to improve
89:27 - so Canada displays if you're still
89:28 - around right i i definitely welcome your
89:32 - your criticism of my my code as being
89:35 - spaghetti code but what would be like
89:37 - more helpful to everybody me and
89:39 - everybody watching is what specific
89:42 - things could we do to make it like what
89:45 - parts of it are the worst and what could
89:47 - we do to fix that right and that's
89:50 - generally like what this stream is kind
89:52 - of about is we all help each other and
89:54 - we get better so anyway so not sure if
90:00 - you're still here you're not commenting
90:02 - anymore but definitely would welcome a
90:05 - pool request was for just an open an
90:07 - issue on get up with some suggestions
90:09 - and if we can we'll definitely implement
90:13 - the suggestions
90:18 - let's see michael Creole says I know I'm
90:23 - a broken record but you're overthinking
90:24 - this perfect is the enemy of good yeah
90:27 - you're right i what i hope doesn't i
90:31 - hope that the idea doesn't just get
90:33 - thrown out completely since we spent i
90:35 - don't know what like 20 minutes on it 25
90:43 - Julio says I recommend bracket pair
90:45 - colorizer to handle brackets frets these
90:47 - curly braces easily you know what let me
90:50 - get that now because people been
90:52 - suggesting it to me it seems like for
90:54 - months and I just never took the time to
90:56 - do it so if I do it now it'll get done C
91:01 - bracket pair colorizer
91:15 - reload
91:25 - yay that's really cool
91:32 - every to everyone who's been suggesting
91:35 - that to me thank you this is this is
91:37 - actually really cool when it's gonna be
91:38 - super helpful so I appreciate it I'm
91:41 - sorry it took me so long does anybody
91:47 - ever take this survey on visual studio
91:49 - code that keeps popping up it's behind
91:51 - that I always say remind me later I
91:54 - always want to take it but I never have
91:56 - time restart to fly latest update I'll
92:00 - restart after the stream ok Phoenix says
92:05 - hey Jessie I made a few designs for
92:07 - badges for free code camp Top
92:08 - Contributor meetup would you mind taking
92:10 - a look at them on here how can I share
92:12 - the link Phoenix do you do you have me
92:15 - on twitter you can DM me on Twitter yeah
92:19 - I'm pretty sure we have each other on
92:21 - Twitter DM it to me onto the link to me
92:23 - on Twitter right now and I'll I'll look
92:27 - it up that's actually really awesome
92:30 - I have a $50 credit still for sticker
92:36 - mule so I wonder if we could use any of
92:41 - the designs for some some stickers Julio
92:49 - says if you go to get tab and visual
92:51 - studio code you can see the changes oh
92:58 - no way
92:59 - I never use that tab that's awesome I'm
93:02 - gonna have to check that I just I never
93:04 - I'm not used to having that so I'm
93:06 - always like if I really wanted to see
93:09 - the changes I would just do like a lucky
93:12 - get div for something that's a that's
93:17 - super useful learning all kind of things
93:20 - today
93:27 - all right so Nikki says get commit em
93:31 - with so what I was saying earlier when
93:34 - we were doing get messages it says it
93:36 - only lets you put a title not the body
93:38 - if you want to do that as well just use
93:41 - git commit you'll have to deal with them
93:45 - if you haven't changed the default gate
93:46 - editor yet actually you're entirely
93:48 - right so you don't have to put the
93:50 - message in line when you're doing you
93:51 - get commits you could just type git
93:53 - commit it'll open up an editor for you
93:56 - depending on whatever you set is your
93:58 - your editor and then you can do a big
94:02 - long commit message if you want I just I
94:07 - never do that because it's faster to
94:10 - just do a short commit message and I
94:12 - almost never have to do a really long
94:15 - one but that can be helpful especially
94:18 - if you're doing a project where they
94:19 - have like a strict structure for how to
94:23 - do commit messages and they want it to
94:25 - have a lot of stuff
94:29 - Nino says I got a sign a new project and
94:33 - react I have to build the UI from the
94:36 - ground up what is your advice to start
94:38 - the right way Wow see you have to do the
94:42 - whole UI okay Nino if you're good with
94:48 - something like Photoshop or sketch or
94:53 - Adobe XD or whatever then I would do you
95:00 - start with your designs like that I'm
95:01 - assuming you don't have designs ready if
95:04 - you already have the designs then in
95:06 - business makes this a lot easier but if
95:09 - you don't have the designs definitely do
95:11 - it on their first get approval from
95:13 - whoever you know your client or your
95:15 - boss or whoever get approval of those
95:18 - designs first before you start
95:21 - developing it it'll save you a ton of
95:23 - time you all see how I do it a lot is
95:26 - that it goes back and forth with
95:28 - development I mean this it's just how
95:30 - things work around here
95:32 - like that's I would kind of like it if
95:36 - we could do design stages
95:39 - get things approved but to be honest
95:42 - with you it just seems like when we
95:43 - start a project it we have it's not even
95:47 - all thought out what people want right
95:49 - so it look people talk about scope creep
95:52 - when you have clients
95:53 - well like working here its scope creep
95:58 - is just a given like it's going to
96:00 - happen because there's gonna be like
96:02 - multiple people that find out the
96:05 - project's happening and join in and then
96:07 - now they have these ideas and so it's
96:11 - it's almost not worth it to even have
96:15 - these separate stages because so much is
96:17 - going to change ends up being kind of a
96:18 - waste of time so that's why our stuff is
96:23 - kind of very fluid right and I'm working
96:26 - I can't just say like hey this is the
96:28 - contract you agreed to this everything
96:30 - else is gonna cost more right there is
96:33 - no contract like this is my my everyday
96:35 - full-time job
96:37 - so anyway depending on your situation
96:39 - this might work differently but just to
96:42 - get started do the designs first then go
96:44 - in what I usually do what I like to do
96:47 - that's kind of more comfortable for me
96:48 - is I just take like one component I
96:53 - start to build everything out in that
96:55 - one component and once the component
96:57 - gets big then I can start to kind of see
96:59 - naturally where you should break things
97:02 - out into different components like at
97:04 - that point then I start breaking things
97:06 - out that seems to be faster for me
97:11 - sometimes if you try to think like these
97:14 - are all the components I'll need
97:15 - beforehand you end up wasting some some
97:18 - work so anyway that's that's how I go
97:22 - about it I'm not sure if it's the best
97:23 - way probably not there's probably better
97:25 - ways to do it but that that seems when I
97:27 - can do it like that then things seem to
97:30 - go like pretty well hopefully that helps
97:36 - Nina Kath deesis I remember used to have
97:40 - a Trello board during strange what
97:41 - happened to it actually I still have a
97:43 - Trello board for this what I ended up
97:45 - doing is a lot of the code related stuff
97:47 - now is in github as issues
97:51 - and then I've been using Google keep
97:53 - which is small checklists to keep myself
97:55 - on track and then I've been using the
97:57 - Trello board to with my student workers
98:01 - to assign tasks to them so it's it's
98:06 - kind of easier they don't have to get a
98:08 - github account or anything like that or
98:10 - figure out how to use get up they I can
98:13 - show you much how I'm using the Trello
98:15 - board right now actually so like this is
98:19 - the kind of stuff I have a Trello now
98:20 - I'm like having them do things so add
98:25 - dates alright so I just had pilgrimages
98:27 - information broken up so there's
98:30 - separate pieces of data now so I can go
98:32 - in and create a page or component for
98:36 - that and then probably probably -
98:39 - they'll be like a single page right so
98:45 - anyway so they just go in here and we
98:47 - can like talk back and forth it allows
98:49 - me to attach screenshots links like so
98:53 - now this one's done - so I can move this
98:55 - over you see I have a backlog of things
98:57 - to test - just make sure it was done
98:59 - right I'm very trusting of my student
99:03 - workers so anyway now like I need to add
99:07 - some more cards because these ones are
99:09 - pretty much finished as well so my
99:12 - student worker is probably waiting for
99:13 - me to give them more tasks now but
99:16 - anyway that's how I'm using that so I've
99:18 - just kind of separated things out like
99:20 - code related stuff is strictly
99:22 - everything's on github now and then
99:25 - content related stuff now is on Trello
99:29 - it's kind of easier with the stream so
99:32 - you all don't have to have another thing
99:35 - to remember to go to to check on things
99:37 - like so you don't have to worry about
99:38 - going to Trello like everything's in
99:40 - github for all the stuff that you all
99:42 - would care about which is is code stuff
99:49 - and then we are also using slack so I
99:52 - can also communicate with my team on
99:56 - slack as well slack and we have shared
100:05 - Word documents that my boss sending me
100:10 - wired documents and Excel spreadsheets
100:11 - with data on it too so there's quite a
100:14 - variety of methods being used here
100:19 - let's see Daniel says would you see my
100:23 - webpage and tell me what you think yeah
100:26 - sure
100:27 - Daniel if you have Twitter or whatever
100:31 - my link to my Twitter account is in the
100:33 - description if you don't have Twitter
100:35 - and you have some other social media
100:37 - thing then I guess you know what you can
100:47 - go to my youtube channel which is also
100:50 - linked there and then I have links to
100:51 - all my other social media so find me on
100:54 - one of those social media things and
100:56 - then direct message me because links
100:59 - don't really work in here
101:00 - so just message me like remind me that
101:05 - you're from the stream message me and
101:06 - I'll check it out and Phoenix I got your
101:15 - message and so I'm checking out your
101:19 - your badges right now let me bring them
101:21 - over we get when you see what you all
101:23 - think as well okay so here's Phoenix's
101:29 - designs for the lanyards oh very nice
101:35 - nice
101:43 - really cool all right how about that you
101:47 - know what I'm gonna copy and paste this
101:49 - link and anybody who's interested in
101:53 - giving some feedback on these you know
101:56 - you can go to this github issue and then
101:58 - you know comment here so I might have I
102:02 - don't know which one I like they're
102:03 - really cool but Phoenix is there anyway
102:09 - cuz I'm I'm just complete rubbish when
102:11 - it comes to graphic design stuff is
102:13 - there any way we could take some sort of
102:16 - design like this and make it into a
102:21 - circular button like okay so here's like
102:34 - the freaking let me switch up my screen
102:36 - so you'll be able to see okay so we've
102:41 - got this free code camp sticker here I
102:43 - think it'd be really cool to have a
102:46 - sticker like this but actually two
102:51 - things would be cool one
102:52 - if I de sticker like this that said live
102:55 - coding with Jesse on it that would be
102:57 - really fun but in regard to this if we
103:00 - had some sort of sticker like this that
103:02 - said something about a Top Contributor
103:04 - 2018 or or just talking tributary then
103:07 - we could reuse it I don't know but
103:09 - something like that that I can make this
103:12 - sticker which this is like I think this
103:15 - is a 2-inch diameter sticker I don't
103:18 - know but that would be really cool and I
103:22 - think I only have a week left until my
103:23 - fifty dollar credit runs out so if we
103:25 - can if you need get me a design that I
103:27 - could use on a sticker mule I'll have
103:29 - like I don't know however many stickers
103:31 - I can get printed out for 50 bucks and
103:34 - then I can print those out that would be
103:36 - awesome so let me know because I don't I
103:40 - don't really know how long that would
103:41 - take you and if it would be a big deal
103:42 - if it's a big deal then you know don't
103:44 - worry about it but if it wouldn't take
103:47 - that much work to come up with something
103:49 - like that that would be really awesome
103:53 - so anyway I just I would have tried to
104:02 - do it myself but I like I'm not good
104:05 - with that stuff let's see
104:21 - michael creo says the categories should
104:23 - be the faculty department then majors i
104:26 - just couldn't remember the query to get
104:29 - that list
104:38 - categories could be Ethan says we're
104:42 - still here for you
104:43 - thank you Nicki says it's it's happening
104:47 - what's happening
105:03 - what's
105:05 - Nikki what's happening I don't remember
105:07 - what was happening at that part of the
105:08 - stream michael says okay so this is in
105:15 - regards to what cannabis well was saying
105:19 - was that the name cannabis plays was
105:21 - saying says well said
105:24 - I remember the beat down I got when I
105:26 - said the same thing when I started
105:28 - watching hopefully he learns like I did
105:31 - Michael I actually don't even remember
105:34 - he's saying the same thing I don't doubt
105:37 - that you did I just I don't know I sure
105:40 - I like honestly when I first started
105:45 - thinking about streaming like I assumed
105:47 - everybody would have that reaction to
105:49 - come in here and say like why would you
105:51 - watch this guy look at that spaghetti
105:53 - code like that is terrible so I'm always
105:57 - just like just so surprised that people
105:59 - don't say that so it happens so
106:02 - infrequently I'm just not really upset
106:04 - about it
106:05 - when it does happen so I don't play that
106:07 - like obviously I forgot when when you
106:10 - said it Michael Michael says he did it
106:15 - my work here is done did what
106:25 - oh wait are y'all talking about when I
106:27 - added the colored bracket thing
106:39 - Nietzsche says anyone here use emojis in
106:41 - their commit messages they're pretty
106:44 - dope I never have but that that would be
106:47 - really fun that sounds like something I
106:51 - should do more Oh Sean says you
106:58 - completed the nanodegree on react right
107:00 - yes I did the Udacity react nano degree
107:04 - so ocean I did do on my youtube channel
107:08 - which is linked in the description I did
107:10 - do a video review of that nano degree so
107:13 - if you're interested in what my thoughts
107:14 - are on it you can check that out but
107:17 - yeah I did do that I was in the like the
107:20 - first cohort so I imagine it's changed a
107:22 - bit there's probably some bugs they
107:25 - worked out since I've done it but so it
107:29 - was like the first cohort I think was
107:32 - last August I think it started so I I
107:37 - guess it's been almost a year now
107:42 - Nino says thank you welcome no problem
107:45 - Michael says you haven't taught your
107:48 - student workers how to use github that
107:50 - should be the first thing you should
107:51 - have taught them I know I should so when
107:54 - I have interns I try to teach them a lot
107:57 - more but with the student workers so
108:00 - when I first talked to them when I was
108:02 - kind of interviewing them I did let them
108:04 - know if you're interested in learning
108:06 - more coding stuff let me know like ask
108:09 - me any questions we can do that and no
108:11 - one really is interested so I don't know
108:14 - if they're interested and they're just
108:16 - like intimidated and don't want to ask
108:19 - me or or they just are here to get paid
108:23 - and or like I'm just gonna do well
108:25 - whatever the work is and that's it which
108:28 - is totally fine I mean I'm sure we've
108:31 - all had jobs like that we it's like I
108:34 - don't want to become a master at this
108:35 - thing I just want to do my working in my
108:37 - paycheck so yeah I don't know some I'm
108:41 - definitely open to teaching them more
108:43 - but if they're not interested then
108:46 - that's one thing I definitely learned
108:48 - from being a high school teacher it was
108:50 - really really hard
108:51 - teach someone something if they do not
108:53 - want to learn yes so I kind of leave it
108:58 - up to students like if they want to know
109:00 - more I give them as much advice as
109:04 - probably more than they want to hear but
109:07 - if they're not interested then I don't I
109:09 - don't push it
109:21 - okay I see Daniel he's putting his sight
109:28 - and here Daniel I'm opening up the sight
109:38 - on my other screen and okay cool
109:51 - let me pull this over actually let me
109:54 - know
109:55 - Daniel is it cool if I pull the your
109:59 - website over on the screen so everybody
110:01 - can see it or you just want me to look
110:02 - at it let me know in the chat
110:20 - see
110:22 - okay so when everyone was excited that I
110:25 - finally did something it was the black
110:27 - bracket payer colorizer okay and you
110:34 - realized you all were that excited about
110:35 - it that I finally did it then hey john
110:41 - Anson's here how's it going
110:47 - no John we did not join us if we had any
110:52 - exclamation for it important overrides
110:54 - today we didn't we didn't have to
110:55 - override anything daniel says if your
111:01 - screen is 4k it may not scale well I
111:03 - think the screen that everybody sees is
111:06 - only 2k okay so Daniels fine with me
111:16 - showing it so this will probably be the
111:17 - last thing we do on the stream before I
111:19 - end it I'm gonna bring over Daniels site
111:23 - okay it's trying to get this at a more
111:31 - reasonable ratio here okay so Daniel is
111:36 - there anything in particular that you
111:37 - you want me to look at with the site or
111:39 - just like kind of general general stuff
111:42 - and anybody in the live chat like feel
111:44 - free to you know check it out as well I
111:47 - guess I could let me copy and paste this
111:51 - link
112:00 - Oh Oh shun says is it my connection or
112:03 - Jessie's webcam oh no what's uh what's
112:06 - happening let me know something's up
112:10 - with the stream it looks okay on my end
112:13 - but maybe maybe something's happening I
112:17 - don't I don't see it
112:27 - let's see daniel-san change pages all
112:34 - right John says no one great hope your
112:35 - day is great - yes it's not bad not bad
112:40 - so far
112:48 - okay you see the next G query that's
112:53 - cool Daniel what are you using for the
112:58 - for this let's see what happened you
113:03 - have some sort of plugin for like this
113:06 - layout or is this all just like kind of
113:10 - custom-made
113:17 - I mean so I meant translate this if you
113:20 - don't mind chapter it approaches opening
113:23 - crashing interesting
113:31 - okay
113:39 - okay cool CSS grid awesome daniel says
113:45 - put sombreros in the search some be
114:02 - sombreros that's pretty cool
114:25 - okay so no framework just shake we're
114:28 - put seda in the search
114:44 - cool let me see sowhat's
114:59 - so HT chapters
115:07 - it's the the site's really fast like the
115:10 - search just immediately pops up
115:22 - John says Nikki has got me running on
115:25 - the edge of Gatsby beta-version to
115:28 - learning a lot getting many hints from
115:31 - Nikki's blog awesome
115:34 - he says click some maybe click something
115:44 - on you ok cool
115:51 - it's really cool I mean I I would just
115:54 - say like styling was there's just some
115:57 - some stuff that needs so like there's
115:59 - some overlap stuff going on right here
116:03 - here so I mean the the little details
116:11 - it's it like yeah so I would maybe make
116:18 - sure that the the areas of overlap
116:22 - aren't aren't happening but in terms of
116:25 - functionality and speed its it's very
116:28 - impressive
116:34 - Nikki says how do you translate the
116:37 - toggle translate on a page if it doesn't
116:39 - just show up up and in this corner
116:43 - there's like this little translate page
116:44 - icon so I just click on that if that
116:50 - doesn't show up I'm not sure how but
116:54 - that's right I just I click there
117:04 - okay
117:13 - all right I think we're gonna wrap
117:18 - things up now
117:19 - so anyway yeah Daniel if if you have any
117:22 - more questions or anything else you want
117:24 - me to look at for there like I said find
117:25 - me on social media or and that goes for
117:30 - anybody if anybody wants to ask me a
117:33 - question or anything check out my
117:35 - youtube channel and all my social media
117:36 - stuff is linked from there and um you
117:41 - know my DMS are open everywhere I will
117:50 - I'm not gonna stream tomorrow so I'm
117:52 - gonna have surgery on my wrist tomorrow
117:54 - and so I'll definitely not stream
