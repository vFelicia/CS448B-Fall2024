00:01 - hi everybody my name is kayla banks i'm
00:04 - 15 years old and this is my crazy dad
00:09 - hi i'm phillip banks and i'm her dad
00:12 - that's not the crazy part
00:13 - [Laughter]
00:14 - so we're here to talk about kind of what
00:17 - jim hit on is how to raise a family in
00:19 - tech but it's so much more than that
00:21 - it's about getting young people into the
00:24 - community and kind of what we're doing
00:26 - and kind of best practices and things i
00:28 - want you to get about what you can do to
00:30 - bring more young people in the family i
00:33 - mean in the community
00:36 - because how diverse are you if you're
00:38 - not considering youth
00:41 - it's we have so many women's
00:43 - and ethnic
00:45 - diversity efforts but not enough youth
00:48 - and to add on to that how diverse really
00:50 - is your community if you don't bring in
00:52 - youth we like to think our communities
00:54 - are diverse because we include women and
00:56 - different people of color and even at
00:58 - the women's open source lunch we were
01:00 - talking about how
01:02 - you know who decides what's diverse
01:04 - and the most overlooked group is youth
01:08 - we're literally hacking into unix linux
01:11 - kernels hacking into minecraft making
01:13 - games we're the most overlooked
01:16 - group
01:17 - and
01:18 - in like a whole bunch of programs like
01:21 - for one example
01:23 - i use a a popular program i'm pretty
01:26 - sure most of you guys have heard of it
01:27 - it's called slack
01:29 - and
01:30 - i use this to collaborate among teens
01:32 - around the world and we were approaching
01:34 - slack about what we're doing we found
01:36 - out that we legally aren't even able to
01:39 - use slack because we're underage
01:42 - and there's a lot of platforms like this
01:44 - that put age restrictions and we
01:46 - literally are stopping
01:48 - in the tech community from progressing
01:50 - because these age restrictions
01:52 - so our talk has changed like 10 times
01:54 - listen to a lot of the good talks at
01:56 - this conference and uh and we were we
01:58 - thought of that one because uh guy
02:00 - martin did a talk yesterday about slack
02:02 - and community and we had a story about
02:04 - slack and just
02:06 - in for slack's purposes we we could also
02:09 - say we talked to them and they're trying
02:11 - to lower the age limits so that younger
02:14 - people can use it
02:16 - so
02:17 - we want to start out talking a little
02:19 - bit about who we are and why we're here
02:21 - but jim hit on most of this stuff but
02:23 - i'll introduce our tech family over to
02:25 - the right is my my son phillip he's the
02:28 - oldest he's 28 and he's a sis ad man and
02:32 - an i.t guy at school then we got hunter
02:35 - right next to him he's a video a game
02:38 - developer and if you google open source
02:41 - gaming
02:42 - you'll see a lot of hunters post
02:45 - uh over to the left we have my son david
02:48 - he's wants to be a surgeon but
02:50 - somehow we're gonna tech that up i don't
02:52 - know we're building cyborgs or something
02:54 - we i tell this boy we're gonna we're
02:56 - gonna work with brainson's connections
02:59 - and then we got at the bottom my
03:01 - daughter kayla
03:03 - and i think you've met her but tell us a
03:05 - little bit more about you kayla
03:07 - well like jim was saying i've been
03:09 - speaking at conferences since i was 11
03:11 - years old and this was my biggest one at
03:14 - o'reilly's oscon which i did the keynote
03:16 - and that one was a group of about five
03:20 - four thousand people in the room but
03:22 - really it reached a bigger audience
03:23 - because that talk kind of went viral
03:26 - and i also had the pleasure of visiting
03:29 - the white house under president obama
03:32 - and
03:32 - [Laughter]
03:33 - notice that
03:36 - it's a lot different there now
03:40 - i was also featured at the melissa
03:42 - harris perry show and
03:45 - we also got to go to the mayor of los
03:47 - angeles and that's also the
03:51 - cto yeah chief technology technology
03:54 - officer of l.a school
03:57 - there's another picture a chief for
03:59 - diversity the chief chief technology
04:01 - officer for the united states of america
04:04 - is a woman for women who want to know
04:06 - that so
04:07 - it was a great role model for my
04:09 - daughter just meeting her and talking
04:11 - about
04:12 - being in her position
04:16 - so the first thing we want to talk about
04:18 - is how we do things
04:20 - how
04:21 - what's what's our method so kayla how do
04:23 - we engage
04:25 - how do we use engagement well as i
04:27 - mentioned earlier i'm 15 so i still go
04:29 - to school and every ride to school we
04:32 - usually have a discussion whether it's a
04:33 - debate
04:34 - or just a regular conversation about a
04:38 - whole different bunch of different
04:39 - topics and usually we try to relate it
04:41 - around tech
04:43 - and
04:44 - i feel that like having these talks on
04:46 - the way to school on the way home it
04:47 - makes us engaged like the reason why
04:50 - kids
04:51 - like the stuff is because it pertains to
04:53 - us we're not just going to you know
04:55 - write a whole bunch of code just for the
04:57 - purpose of it it has to relate to us and
04:59 - i think engagement is a crucial part in
05:02 - involving youth in the tech community
05:05 - so we we believe in
05:07 - a lot of reverse engineering and i think
05:10 - that gets a lot of youth involved in
05:12 - something and it's whatever thing that
05:15 - they like to do
05:18 - so at southern california linux expo
05:20 - where i'm one of the chairs there and my
05:22 - kids have been involved since the
05:24 - beginning what 16 years ago
05:26 - um
05:27 - we get
05:28 - we started to implement more youth
05:31 - programs and we're starting to get more
05:32 - high schools to come and and you'll find
05:36 - that you ask them to reverse engineer
05:38 - stuff
05:39 - and just think how does that work how do
05:41 - we get that there how do we get that and
05:43 - then it gets them started on a path
05:45 - that
05:46 - will get them to
05:47 - [Music]
05:48 - every community like we have even some
05:51 - kids that are current of colonel
05:52 - developers and i mean one who just like
05:55 - idolizes line historicals and so he was
05:57 - like you gotta talk to him when you get
05:59 - there so
06:00 - we
06:00 - you get that engagement and then you get
06:02 - them started and then sky's the limit
06:07 - next is goals
06:09 - what do we do with goals
06:11 - well goals are a huge part of our year
06:14 - and when i say goals i'm not just
06:15 - talking about new year's resolutions
06:17 - that everyone sets and forgets about
06:18 - during the year the goals that we set we
06:21 - try to tend to set ten goals eight goals
06:23 - that we make for ourselves and two goals
06:26 - that our dad sets and most of the time
06:28 - their tech goals each year i try to
06:29 - learn a new language
06:31 - and but although they're not always tech
06:34 - they're always they're also like
06:35 - personal and physical and emotional
06:37 - goals and these goals make me strive to
06:40 - be a better person
06:41 - like last year my goal was to learn
06:44 - javascript more and teach more kids and
06:48 - i was able to do that
06:50 - yeah a lot of times we'll feel like man
06:52 - we're slacking but
06:54 - when you start looking at those goals
06:56 - and we do like every three or four
06:58 - months we do review of your pace on your
07:00 - goals and i tell the kids you know me
07:03 - and my wife set two of their goals they
07:05 - can set eight goals for the year but
07:08 - we'll set two because you know you kind
07:09 - of want to guide their course so if
07:11 - you're mentoring or you're working with
07:13 - youth or niece nephews
07:15 - then
07:17 - having them have some investment in
07:18 - their own goals
07:20 - is the key thing because you know then
07:22 - they think
07:23 - stop bossing me around i'm
07:26 - kind of doing this myself
07:31 - so
07:32 - we
07:33 - the thing with getting youth into our
07:36 - communities
07:37 - is
07:38 - the barriers
07:40 - you feel
07:42 - fear in doing something with adults and
07:44 - you know and a lot of people i always
07:46 - ask kayla like you're not terrified
07:48 - being in front of a lot of people that
07:50 - are adults you know the kid are the kids
07:53 - audiences you know easy and she's always
07:55 - done adult
07:56 - audiences tell us about embracing the
07:59 - fear kb
08:00 - well one particular story is when i was
08:03 - 12 years old my first big audience was
08:06 - at pycon in montreal
08:08 - and it was a lightning talk and what my
08:10 - dad told me was you can get up on the
08:13 - stage you can completely fall just trip
08:16 - over this whole stage
08:18 - and
08:18 - one thing to remember to do is just
08:20 - laugh at yourself and i guess that
08:22 - advice worked out because i'm here
08:24 - speaking in front of all of you guys
08:25 - today
08:26 - [Laughter]
08:28 - so if we trip or anything on the stage
08:30 - we are going to laugh at ourselves if we
08:32 - fluff any lines believe it's going to
08:34 - happen
08:35 - uh
08:36 - yeah so that one we pretty much said
08:39 - like the fear of of doing stuff a lot of
08:42 - the young developers they are afraid of
08:45 - even submitting code or
08:48 - entering in a lot of these things
08:49 - because like one of the kids that was a
08:51 - kernel developer he he said you know his
08:54 - code getting rejected was like the
08:57 - biggest thing to him and yet i was like
08:59 - go back go go there again keep doing
09:02 - that and
09:04 - once they get over that
09:05 - then they can do everything
09:08 - and so that's why i tell them every
09:11 - project isn't your first one you're your
09:13 - best one you know it's some things go
09:16 - wrong and interviewing a lot of
09:18 - programmers before they you know spoke
09:21 - at our conferences the conferences we've
09:23 - been at uh one of the main things i
09:25 - asked them you know is like how did you
09:27 - get started and a lot of them said i
09:29 - wanted to make a video game
09:31 - somewhere where along the line that
09:32 - didn't work and i remember that was my
09:34 - first thing when i was 10 i wanted to be
09:37 - like a video game so i learned
09:39 - that didn't work but it led me into so
09:41 - many other way places
09:44 - comparing yourself to no one kayla tell
09:46 - me about that
09:48 - and another thing that ties into this is
09:50 - imposter syndrome i'm a victim of
09:52 - imposter syndrome and i know a lot of
09:53 - people in the tech community are victims
09:56 - of it too
09:57 - on the way here it was an 11 hour flight
10:00 - and i'm sitting here thinking in my mind
10:01 - like why am i being able to fly all the
10:04 - way to prague like i'm not as smart as
10:06 - most of the people in this room
10:08 - and
10:09 - literally when i was sitting in don
10:11 - foster's talk yesterday
10:13 - like five people raised their hand and
10:15 - said that they contributed to the linux
10:17 - kernel like we're literally contributing
10:20 - to the linux kernel and i'm pretty sure
10:22 - a lot of people are capable or have
10:25 - already done stuff like this so i have
10:27 - to constantly remind myself to compare
10:29 - myself to no one and instead motivate
10:32 - myself are inspired by other people like
10:35 - reuben for example who had a great talk
10:38 - on monday yeah that was a great talk if
10:40 - you missed reuben's talk you know seeing
10:42 - a young kid 11 years old if i'm correct
10:45 - still the 11 right yeah
10:47 - and him getting up on stage and saying
10:49 - all the stuff that he's doing
10:51 - if he's not in your community if you're
10:52 - not you're looking at him like ah that
10:54 - was nothing then
10:56 - you know your community is is not as
10:59 - diverse as you need it to be
11:01 - um
11:03 - uh
11:04 - the biggest thing about the this one for
11:06 - me and i don't know if you have some
11:08 - more on this one too kayla
11:10 - is that adults
11:12 - the one thing we
11:14 - we work with a lot of students now we've
11:16 - started programs around la
11:19 - and hopefully around the world so where
11:22 - we're dealing with a lot of young people
11:24 - that are versed to tech
11:27 - from the start
11:28 - and
11:29 - to get them from ground zero to where
11:32 - you you know where they want to be
11:34 - is a hard thing because i know with my
11:36 - own kids
11:37 - i had to
11:38 - you know stop
11:40 - monitoring them and
11:42 - micromanaging them and thinking
11:44 - they have to take the same path as me
11:47 - they take everybody takes a whole
11:49 - different path to where they want to be
11:52 - so if you do it your way they're
11:54 - different than you and so we're that's
11:56 - our big thing with schools do we learn
11:58 - anything like that with uh some of the
12:00 - students at uh some of the schools so
12:02 - far did you get
12:04 - yes and like my dad mentioned we've been
12:06 - working with schools and most of the
12:08 - time we realize that a lot of these kids
12:11 - tend to just need a bit of motivation
12:13 - and from on there you have your own
12:16 - self-motivation and i think that's
12:18 - crucial and even going to conferences
12:20 - like this i tend to get triggered and
12:22 - have a whole bunch of self-motivation
12:24 - even go into some of the booths like red
12:26 - hat and all the other ones i go home and
12:29 - with all these papers and i'm like what
12:30 - am i going to learn next like what am i
12:32 - going to program
12:34 - yeah so
12:36 - and a lot of the
12:37 - people at the booth the clouds and boots
12:39 - on our new thing is kubernetes so we're
12:41 - just like what is that and so we
12:43 - probably stopped by a ton of your boots
12:44 - and then grabbed you you're a gang of
12:46 - times about that because i want high
12:48 - school kids to start learning that kind
12:50 - of thing
12:51 - so
12:52 - from there
12:54 - we start taking it to the next level so
12:56 - where do we want to go from there kayla
12:58 - they're probably asking themselves okay
13:00 - you told us a lot about what you're
13:02 - doing a lot of things that you know we
13:04 - could do
13:05 - what's next what's our
13:08 - what are we doing
13:09 - well we're not mostly focusing ourselves
13:12 - now now we're starting to focus on other
13:14 - kids getting other kids involved and so
13:17 - as you can see right now we're teaching
13:19 - at schools and we're starting our own
13:21 - company called banks family tech which
13:22 - is going to be on facebook soon
13:25 - and during the summer of la we
13:28 - taught at
13:29 - parent middle school and
13:32 - tom bradley middle school and as you can
13:34 - see these are some of our kids
13:36 - and
13:37 - teaching basically is the next
13:38 - generation like we said youth they're
13:41 - the overlooked group
13:43 - and so directly reaching out to this
13:45 - group and teaching them you know you got
13:47 - to be the part of
13:48 - you've got to be the new generation of
13:50 - the tech community and this is part of
13:53 - our teaching at schools yeah you notice
13:55 - uh some of these are even young this is
13:58 - a class of fifth graders
14:00 - and
14:01 - i i don't like to put down any languages
14:04 - in particular because everything serves
14:05 - purpose but
14:07 - we do programs where they're actually
14:08 - learning real code because that is a lot
14:12 - of stem programs science technology
14:15 - engineering and math
14:16 - programs
14:17 - uh in the united states are focused on
14:21 - just saying we're teaching some coding
14:23 - and we're not big fans of that you know
14:26 - like one of the things i really loved
14:28 - about ruben's talk is he was he was
14:29 - doing some python writing isn't and
14:32 - young kids can learn this now a lot of
14:34 - times we use things like scratch is a
14:37 - language that it it's like scratching a
14:39 - chalkboard for me to hear because
14:41 - they're not really learning life
14:43 - applicable
14:45 - languages
14:47 - so uh
14:49 - so we're teaching in schools
14:51 - and
14:52 - what do we want to do from there we uh
14:55 - we want you to
14:56 - our next thing was like how do you get
14:58 - involved
14:59 - we want
15:00 - there's so many tech minds in this room
15:03 - that can that can give back to the
15:05 - communities there's if everyone in here
15:09 - multiplied that knowledge at one school
15:12 - just going to one group of kids and
15:14 - getting one kid
15:16 - involved
15:18 - imagine how many kids around this world
15:21 - will be because
15:22 - i only i tell them this is just a tool
15:26 - you can do whatever you want in life
15:27 - there's some people that were graphic
15:29 - design
15:30 - and that's what my son hunter it's my
15:32 - son hunter teaching us uh these two
15:34 - schools that's my son david down there
15:36 - helping with this
15:38 - hunter was more graphic design
15:40 - applied to video game design
15:43 - so
15:44 - how are we gonna um that's how
15:46 - you can get involved and
15:49 - help us
15:50 - so now kayla made this i said tell tell
15:52 - us about this one kayla so this light is
15:55 - they can dedicated to our community as
15:57 - we mentioned earlier we live in los
15:59 - angeles but even all the way on the
16:01 - other side of the world we literally
16:03 - have so many familiar faces like
16:06 - mythia
16:09 - um that's our friend guy and adrian and
16:12 - all these people and so being in tech
16:14 - really enables a community and that's
16:17 - what we're trying to portray and yeah
16:19 - these are all of our friends there shout
16:21 - out to nipia a lot of the people we've
16:23 - seen here today so like i'm saying we've
16:26 - changed the side so many times seeing so
16:28 - many new faces you know nithya talks and
16:31 - kayla and the women's in tech talk came
16:34 - out with a couple new friends and
16:36 - and then i was like different people we
16:38 - didn't even know we're here you know
16:40 - jono you see we see him in every city or
16:43 - i don't know where that guy ever stops
16:46 - at the house
16:48 - and uh of course our new friend angela
16:50 - is here uh running this conference and
16:54 - and
16:55 - so community so
16:57 - having my kids in this community all
17:00 - this time there's so many people we can
17:02 - we
17:03 - i mean even when we went to the white
17:04 - house we
17:05 - there was people across the room like
17:07 - hey there's so and so and they're in the
17:08 - tech community and then they offer their
17:11 - advice or anything if they know them
17:13 - but imagine if more kids are involved
17:15 - and
17:16 - get these contacts and everything like
17:19 - like some of our young programmers like
17:20 - reuben get these contacts and then they
17:23 - help them and they help develop them
17:26 - as programmers and as developers as
17:28 - designers and engineers
17:32 - so
17:33 - now with all that
17:35 - what are they going to do are they going
17:36 - to reach out to us
17:37 - yeah you guys going to reach out to us
17:39 - are you guys going to
17:41 - you guys going to contact us on facebook
17:44 - and so there's our facebook that's my
17:46 - primary source of contact and you can
17:49 - also since we have to leave right after
17:50 - i have to get back to school you guys
17:52 - can shoot us the email and lastly you
17:55 - guys can for sure tweet us because our
17:57 - twitter game is about to be a1
18:00 - yeah we're not
18:02 - as big on our twitter
18:04 - but we're going to be all over social
18:06 - media and this is the thing we wanted to
18:08 - get everybody else involved and just
18:10 - like you know we want you to reach out
