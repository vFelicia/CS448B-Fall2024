00:00 - all right so very quickly let me explain
00:01 - this video i was thinking about taking
00:03 - you through a walkthrough of one of my
00:04 - days but the problem is every single day
00:07 - is different so whatever i'm doing on
00:09 - monday may not be truly representative
00:11 - of what i'm going to be doing on tuesday
00:12 - wednesday thursday or friday and being a
00:14 - freelance web developer you're going to
00:16 - find that you're going to be working at
00:18 - different hours during the day and
00:19 - sometimes overnight so i figured let me
00:21 - just try to throw into a video
00:23 - everything that i possibly try to do
00:26 - during a typical day and again there are
00:28 - no typical days so watch the video
00:30 - hopefully you enjoy it i'm going to show
00:32 - you some footage of what i do during
00:34 - various days again remember i'm married
00:36 - with three kids and i work from home so
00:38 - hopefully you enjoyed this video just
00:40 - see what time that says
00:42 - let's see if i can focus in on that 4 33
00:45 - ass in the morning that's crazy
00:48 - that's what it looks like outside right
00:49 - now
00:51 - this is the time the champions
00:53 - get up
00:55 - [Music]
01:18 - how's your egg on is it good
01:26 - uh
01:27 - [Music]
01:57 - yes i pack everything mama
01:59 - i gotta show you what's in my bag
02:01 - in my bag i have um
02:04 - my little macbook air that way i can
02:07 - code whenever i have to on the go i have
02:10 - some diapers
02:11 - there's well some pull-ups because he's
02:13 - actually using pull-ups now
02:15 - because this one still needs it and of
02:16 - course we gotta have water
02:19 - and i got his water there too
02:21 - in the car we got the drone we got a
02:23 - moped here's moped the video camera and
02:25 - the dslr camera so you got a lot of
02:27 - stuff in the bag
02:29 - [Music]
02:40 - hello
02:42 - today we're learning what are we doing
02:44 - today
02:46 - today we're working right yes all right
02:49 - what's up everybody
02:51 - videos what's up everybody my name is
02:53 - joel i'm the creator of pixelmer.com and
02:55 - this is my son gavin he is my assistant
02:59 - he spends a lot of time with me whenever
03:01 - i'm coding whenever i'm building
03:03 - websites whenever i'm here working from
03:06 - home i'm a freelance web developer i
03:08 - create wordpress powered websites and i
03:10 - do it from the distraction field area
03:12 - called my house
03:14 - and what i always try to advocate that
03:16 - people try to get a dedicated
03:17 - environment where they could just
03:19 - strictly focus on the things they have
03:20 - to work on sometimes that's not possible
03:23 - so you have to be able to push through
03:24 - and just get the job done yes
03:27 - like that exactly right papa yes so this
03:30 - video is about a day in the life of a
03:32 - freelance web developer and in my case a
03:34 - wordpress developer you know every day
03:36 - is different no day is the same you know
03:38 - i get up at different times every day i
03:40 - go to sleep at different times every
03:42 - night some days i'm working from home
03:43 - some days i go outside and i work either
03:46 - from a coffee shop or i've actually
03:48 - tried working from the beach but that
03:49 - kind of doesn't work out especially
03:51 - since when it's so nice outside you just
03:53 - want to relax under the sun so that one
03:55 - may not actually be something that saw a
03:57 - good idea to do but working at a park is
03:59 - not a bad idea working at a coffee shop
04:01 - is awesome and being able to be mobile
04:04 - is ideal because you can work from home
04:06 - but you know sometimes you want to
04:08 - change up your environment you want to
04:09 - change things around a little bit of
04:10 - background i'm married i have three kids
04:12 - and i started coding later on in life it
04:14 - wasn't my first career i didn't start
04:16 - coding when i was in you know high
04:18 - school and become one of those prodigy
04:20 - type coders i learned based out of
04:22 - necessity and then out of desire i chose
04:24 - to change careers and i went from being
04:26 - a suit and tie type of guy to being a
04:28 - t-shirt or a polo shirt and jeans type
04:31 - of guys
04:40 - thank you very much dana is new york
04:42 - city ready for the ufc
04:44 - [Applause]
04:53 - and ever since making the transition i
04:55 - haven't looked back i get to spend a
04:57 - significant amount of time in my family
04:59 - which is very important to me make it
05:01 - exactly right and i get to spend time
05:03 - working on the projects that i want to
05:05 - work on yes
05:06 - yeah right this is my little assistant
05:08 - over here he's gonna end up creating
05:10 - something awesome in the future and he's
05:12 - gonna be a million times better coder
05:13 - than i am yeah i'm a big boy you're a
05:17 - big boy that's right high five
05:19 - all right so in preparation for making
05:21 - this video i tried to figure out what
05:22 - would be the best representation of a
05:24 - typical day and again that's very
05:26 - difficult to try to portray because
05:28 - every day is different every day is
05:30 - unique
05:32 - so i figured i just laid out on the
05:34 - table every day is different i get up at
05:36 - different times in the morning go to bed
05:38 - at different times tonight some days i'm
05:40 - working on clients websites some days
05:41 - i'm working on my themes that i sell on
05:43 - my website pixelmorph.com and i do both
05:45 - because you're not always going to have
05:47 - clients in the pipeline and that's
05:48 - something to realize you need to find a
05:50 - way to make some passive income so
05:52 - that's why i chose to besides working on
05:54 - client website and contract work i
05:56 - decided to create some wordpress themes
05:58 - that i sell on my website where people
06:00 - could buy them from i've also taken part
06:02 - in affiliate marketing and now creating
06:04 - videos on youtube so having the ability
06:06 - to make some passive revenue and also
06:08 - have some client work and contract work
06:10 - is vital to my workflow and going into
06:13 - workflow that's different for everybody
06:15 - i work on three different types of
06:17 - systems i work primarily in my
06:19 - workstation computer here which is a
06:20 - windows based uh computer and i built
06:23 - the computer myself so that way i can
06:25 - have a video editing rig and the triple
06:27 - monitor setup makes it a lot more
06:29 - productive for me but again this is the
06:32 - workstation that stays here i can't take
06:34 - this anywhere with me at least not
06:36 - easily so that's why i still also have
06:38 - my laptops i have a macbook pro a
06:41 - macbook air and i have a linux based uh
06:44 - laptop it was formerly a windows based
06:46 - laptop but i wiped out windows on that
06:48 - one and i just put up a linux mint on
06:50 - that laptop and that allows me to be
06:53 - mobile so whenever i'm working from home
06:55 - i'm most likely working on this computer
06:57 - and then whenever i'm outside i take one
06:58 - of the
06:59 - laptops with me most often i take the
07:01 - macbook air because that is the smallest
07:03 - one it's the 11 inch
07:05 - macbook air and this is one of the best
07:08 - laptops because it's so small so tiny
07:10 - and you can pretty much take it with you
07:12 - anywhere battery life on it is pretty
07:14 - good this is not a new one it's a 2012
07:17 - but it's perfect for you know coating on
07:20 - the go so this definitely is always in
07:22 - my bag whenever i'm going outside and
07:24 - actually that's going to be a good video
07:26 - to create what's in my bag but that's
07:28 - for another time
07:29 - so this is the macbook air that's what i
07:31 - take when i'm on the go obviously i have
07:33 - breakfast lunch and dinner i drink
07:34 - coffee that's what keeps me up yeah i
07:37 - eat juice yeah gavin drinks juice
07:40 - and uh
07:41 - we're gonna actually break for some
07:43 - lunch now so we're gonna uh probably
07:45 - have what are we gonna have
07:49 - oh i made some chicken nuggets so i
07:50 - think it's ready so we're gonna
07:52 - start getting that now and then we're
07:54 - gonna jump on the computer and show you
07:56 - a little bit of what i do here
07:59 - we need to buy in the old mandela
08:03 - yeah yeah but we're not going to
08:04 - mcdonald's today
08:06 - um
08:07 - anyway so i'm gonna
08:09 - break for lunch right now and then i'm
08:10 - gonna take some footage of typically
08:13 - what i do on my computer i'll show some
08:15 - screenshots of what i do on my coding
08:17 - process i work with html see it says
08:20 - javascript php mysql and wordpress i use
08:23 - the visual studio code text editor and
08:26 - sometimes i use phpstorm as well i also
08:28 - have git as part of my workflow because
08:30 - it's a great version control and i use
08:32 - gulp as the task runner that's an
08:34 - important part of my workflow because it
08:36 - helps to take care of the lower level
08:38 - processes that uh would take a
08:40 - significant amount of time and again as
08:42 - i said you know i'm all over the place
08:44 - some days i'm working from home some
08:45 - days i'm working off-site and time is
08:48 - money especially if you're freelancers
08:50 - so you have to find every single way you
08:52 - can to try to save time so you can focus
08:54 - on the larger tasks at hand alright so
08:56 - right now gonna break for lunch
08:58 - [Music]
09:08 - uh
09:14 - [Music]
09:38 - uh
09:43 - [Music]
10:07 - all right so hopefully you found this
10:08 - video helpful i wanted to provide you
10:10 - with a little bit of insight of what a
10:12 - freelancer does during the day and again
10:15 - every single day is going to be
10:16 - different so to say there's going to be
10:17 - a typical day well that's not going to
10:19 - tell you the whole story because again
10:21 - one day you're going to be doing one
10:23 - project the next day you'll be working
10:25 - on another project so you have to be
10:27 - able to be adept if you have to be able
10:28 - to change your mindset and change your
10:31 - workflow of course it's good to have
10:33 - structure of course it's good to try to
10:34 - schedule your day and try to plan out
10:36 - what you're looking to accomplish but
10:38 - instead of giving yourself a schedule
10:40 - try to give yourself goals try to
10:42 - identify what needs to get done on any
10:45 - given day alright so hopefully you found
10:47 - the video helpful if you did give it a
10:48 - thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe
10:50 - and if you're new to freelancing
10:52 - hopefully this helped and i'll see you
