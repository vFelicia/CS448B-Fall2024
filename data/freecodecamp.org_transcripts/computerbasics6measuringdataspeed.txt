00:01 - Hi, I'm brianna from Free Code Camp and today. We're going to be talking about Data speed
00:06 - Data speed unlike Data size is usually measured in bits per second
00:13 - Whereas size is measured in bytes
00:15 - Big difference being bytes is eight times bigger than bits at the very smallest level once we start talking
00:22 - Exponentially that makes a really big difference
00:26 - How we talk about speed kind of depends on what we're talking about when we talk about the speed of like an audio download
00:33 - We talk about kilobits per second
00:37 - kilobits not kilobytes totally different number today
00:40 - We're talking about an internet speed like the speed that your internet service provider gives you they usually measure that in megabits per second
00:48 - so 1 million bits per second the network speed is something we talked about in gigabits per second so a
00:56 - Billion bits per second biggest distinction here bits versus bytes Data speed is generally measured in bits
01:04 - Data size is measured in bytes
01:08 - Another thing we want to discuss
01:09 - Just because they have an internet speed that
01:12 - Says you get a certain amount of download that doesn't mean you're going to be able to download that many bytes
01:18 - Per minute per second that's just not going to happen they're talking about bits
01:22 - It's going to take you a little bit longer to do that since your data size is dealing with bytes
