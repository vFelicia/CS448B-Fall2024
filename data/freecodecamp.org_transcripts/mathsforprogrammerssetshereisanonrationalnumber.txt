00:00 - In this video I'll be giving an example
of a non-rational number. if the square
00:05 - root of two were rational number then by
definition it must be expressed as the
00:09 - ratio of two integers. If we then square
both sides we have two equals a squared
00:14 - divided by B squared. If we multiply both
sides by b square root of 2 b
00:20 - squared equals A squared and from this
we know that A squared is even. A squared
00:24 - is even because we have two times some
integer which is B squared. Since A
00:30 - squared is even, we know that is even
because a squared equals two times a
00:35 - manager the integer I chose was 2k
squared that means that a times a can be
00:40 - expressed as 2k x 2k which is to say
that A equals 2K. I can now substitute
00:45 - 2 x 2k squared or A squared and that
leaves us with B squared equals 2K
00:52 - squared once these twos cancel out. Now, this also means that B squared is even
00:58 - because b squared equals 2 times some
integer which is to say that B is also
01:02 - even, following this same logic. Now we go back to our original premise the square
01:09 - root of 2 equals A divided by B where a
divided by B is an irreducible fraction.
01:16 - But since A is an even number and B is
also an even number we can express these
01:24 - numbers as 2k and 2L. But these 2s
here will reduce meaning that will have
01:30 - the square root of 2 equals K / L but
since this reduced since this is no
01:36 - longer explicitly represented as A
divided by B and it reduced to
01:40 - K / L we know that we do not have a
rational number. Now, there's a more
01:46 - specific way to define these numbers or
classify these numbers but we need set
01:53 - operators in the next video
