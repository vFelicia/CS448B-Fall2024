00:04 - hey everybody welcome to live Kony with
00:07 - Jessie I'm Jessie and today we're going
00:09 - to do some react stuff I'm very very
00:13 - excited because we have a launch date
00:16 - for this website that we've been working
00:19 - on this is now stream number 96 this
00:24 - project I'm just so so ready to launch
00:29 - this thing I want people to see it we've
00:31 - put so much work into this I want to
00:34 - know either whether they like it or hate
00:36 - it I want to know I wanted people to
00:38 - actually use it and get feedback and so
00:42 - I've been putting in a lot of work
00:45 - I've been working a lot from home and
00:47 - I've been going to a lot of meetings and
00:49 - unfortunately doing paperwork
00:51 - so it's been a while since I streamed
00:54 - also this was a short week here in the
00:56 - United States Monday was a national
00:59 - holiday so a lot of people had the day
01:02 - off including me so that's why I haven't
01:06 - been streaming a lot I'm gonna try to do
01:09 - better next week hopefully next week
01:11 - it's gonna be hectic though so we're
01:13 - gonna plan on launching next Wednesday
01:16 - that is September 12th
01:19 - I believe so September 12th is gonna be
01:23 - the launch date probably I'm thinking
01:27 - sometime in the afternoon not like too
01:29 - late cuz I want to get out of here you
01:31 - know on time but maybe maybe like very
01:35 - early afternoon something like that I
01:38 - think would be a good launch so let me
01:41 - show you what what my schedules like to
01:44 - get this finished before we jump into
01:46 - some code you switch to my screen here
01:49 - and I'm gonna zoom in hopefully you'll
01:55 - be able to see this okay so this is my
01:57 - Trello board where y'all can see
02:00 - everything I'm working on it's I believe
02:03 - it's a public Trello board so I'm gonna
02:05 - copy and paste this link into the live
02:08 - chat so you can check that out let me
02:12 - know
02:13 - I don't see I'm gonna see any activity
02:17 - in the live chat so all right cool I see
02:20 - something now I was worried that it
02:22 - wasn't working for me so if you want to
02:28 - check out my Trello board and how I have
02:30 - this set up feel free but basically what
02:33 - needs to happen before we launch is
02:35 - everything in this in progress and ready
02:38 - for dev columns this stuff here this to
02:41 - do I've left things in here that don't
02:43 - need to be done yet it can be put off
02:47 - till after work after we've launched so
02:51 - basically I have what do we have here so
02:56 - my estimates are in the dark blue in
02:58 - terms of how many Pomodoro sessions
03:00 - it'll take me to complete these so
03:02 - that's 25 minute sessions so I'm I'm
03:05 - hoping that I can get at least ten
03:08 - sessions in per day per workday and at
03:12 - that rate then I should definitely be
03:15 - able to get this stuff ready for launch
03:17 - now some things that aren't on here are
03:20 - like I guess late deployment type of
03:25 - things so getting like domain names
03:29 - pointed to the right place you know
03:31 - things like that so it is gonna take
03:34 - longer than this to get it ready but and
03:38 - I'm also hoping that some of these items
03:40 - will take less time than I've estimated
03:44 - so today specifically we're gonna create
03:49 - a landing page for admission staff so
03:54 - the first page is just going to be a
03:55 - list of all the staff members and
03:57 - admissions and then the next component
04:00 - that we're gonna make is going to be the
04:02 - component just for a particular staff
04:05 - member okay so if you click on an item
04:09 - in the list it will take you to the page
04:12 - for that staff member this is going to
04:14 - follow the same pattern that we used for
04:17 - the for the faculty components so the
04:23 - first thing we're going to do is look at
04:25 - that the faculty list component
04:27 - and then the faculty page component and
04:29 - first thing we'll do is see in this
04:32 - potential you could save us a lot of
04:34 - time could we just modify those and use
04:37 - them as well if the answer is yes that's
04:39 - what we'll do otherwise what we'll do is
04:41 - copy and paste make new components and
04:44 - just edit them to fit our use case here
04:48 - okay I see some people saying hello and
04:53 - hey did dijanna let me know if I'm
04:58 - pronouncing that right
04:59 - dijanna says hi from Bosnia hey how's it
05:01 - going I got some other questions I'm
05:05 - gonna do a Pomodoro session first of
05:08 - coding and then I'm gonna take a break
05:09 - and I'm gonna answer all the questions
05:11 - so if you ask something just hang on for
05:13 - a little bit we're gonna do 25 minutes
05:15 - of code to start then we'll do questions
05:17 - and then we'll switch switch back and
05:20 - forth okay if you you're saying hello -
05:22 - Alex Richard hey how's it going okay all
05:29 - right great now we have a decent number
05:30 - of viewers now 77 all right hey
05:32 - everybody I'm assuming there's some new
05:34 - people here how's it going
05:36 - if you are new this is my everyday work
05:38 - I work at a small University and we are
05:41 - making a new main website let me give
05:46 - you a link so you can check out the site
05:47 - as we work on it
05:49 - I'm gonna paste this in now and you can
05:52 - check out the site navigate to whatever
05:54 - page you want inspect it in your own
05:57 - browser and I'll double check to see if
06:02 - this works
06:02 - all right cool so people are getting on
06:04 - there hey Quincy's here how's it going
06:08 - Quincey did that link come through I'm
06:14 - gonna paste that one more time because
06:16 - it's all it said I had an error so okay
06:20 - people are clicking on it now awesome
06:25 - I'm gonna move over to the code and
06:31 - let's check out those components that we
06:34 - that I mentioned just a minute ago
06:37 - so this faculty list component and then
06:41 - also the faculty
06:47 - oops
06:49 - faculty is now we're using next Jas so
06:52 - any of these components we have in our
06:54 - pages folder is actually gonna be like a
06:58 - route right so work on the I guess we'll
07:05 - work on the faculty list first okay so
07:08 - in our faculty list let's take our
07:12 - styles and move them down so if you've
07:14 - been watching you know I've slowly been
07:17 - moving all of our style objects down to
07:20 - the bottom because I think it makes it
07:22 - easier to figure out what a components
07:24 - knowing when you open it up immediately
07:26 - you don't have as much scrolling going
07:28 - on so we'll get that out of the way and
07:31 - we see here that we're using the next
07:34 - Jas get initial props function and this
07:37 - this lets us get some data for that
07:40 - server-side rendering is so we're
07:43 - passing in an ID and a type so this is
07:47 - getting passed in from our server das
07:49 - file in our routing function that we
07:51 - have there and the ID in this case is
07:57 - the faculty members name and then the
08:00 - type should be is it faculty or the type
08:09 - might actually be what department
08:14 - they're in right so they're they're
08:16 - gonna have a category each faculty
08:18 - member is categorized based on the
08:20 - department they teach in so I think
08:22 - that's what that is here okay we're
08:28 - bringing in some style sheets and
08:35 - yeah we just map over each faculty
08:38 - member and we have this faculty list
08:40 - item okay
08:43 - you know what I think we're gonna do I
08:45 - think it may in this case it may
08:47 - actually be faster to just copy and
08:48 - paste and make a staff list component at
08:51 - some point down the road I think it
08:53 - would be nice to maybe combine these and
08:55 - just have one component but I doing this
09:03 - live I know like I'm gonna get a little
09:06 - bit confused about how to make this
09:07 - happen quickly enough so I'd rather just
09:11 - do separate components that way I won't
09:13 - break the components that are here that
09:15 - already work and if we have to launch
09:17 - without this I can just put a little you
09:19 - know more info coming soon on that page
09:22 - and we can still launch all right so
09:28 - let's copy all this and let's make a new
09:34 - page it's gonna call this staff list dot
09:39 - J s let's paste that in there and first
09:46 - thing I always do when I copy and paste
09:48 - component is make sure I change the name
09:51 - so we're gonna change it in several
09:54 - places so we just changed the name of
10:00 - the component but also we change the
10:03 - name of the query staff list query we
10:06 - haven't made this query yet so we're
10:07 - gonna have to make a graph QL query as
10:09 - well so that's kind of fun we'll get to
10:12 - see some of that and then also this
10:15 - staff list item component we're gonna
10:21 - pull this as well and I need to bring
10:23 - this in so let's get rid of this and say
10:28 - staff so we're gonna need to modify this
10:33 - component the reason I'm making separate
10:35 - components is because the faculty
10:39 - members have a lot more information that
10:42 - we needed to display so I don't want to
10:46 - mess with that I wouldn't
10:48 - like conditionally say like if this
10:50 - information is there then display it
10:52 - otherwise don't display I may have that
10:55 - set up already I don't remember if I did
10:56 - so it's just going to be easier if I
11:00 - mm-hmm it's gonna be easier if I I don't
11:04 - worry about that right now and I'll
11:07 - probably immediately make an issue in
11:09 - github saying like hey can we refactor
11:11 - these and combine them all and then
11:13 - it'll be there for whenever I get time
11:17 - or if one of you wants to take a shot at
11:19 - it
11:20 - then then we can work on refactoring
11:25 - let's see okay so this component
11:29 - basically what we want to do is make
11:34 - sure so we definitely need the key we
11:36 - need the profile name profile link it's
11:41 - not gonna say faculty though it's gonna
11:44 - say this is going to be a little tricky
11:49 - so the link is actually going to be
11:51 - admissions staff and we'll have to make
12:00 - sure that in our router that this all
12:02 - works out so we'll take a look at our
12:05 - router a little bit later so we have
12:09 - that the job title let me show you what
12:13 - it looks like right now so let's go to
12:19 - Franciscan dot edu this is the current
12:22 - site so not the new one that we're
12:24 - working on Franciscan dot edu slash
12:28 - admissions staff I just want to see what
12:34 - info we're already displaying to make
12:36 - sure we at least display what users are
12:39 - are used to seeing now so it looks like
12:42 - we have name title a little bit of
12:47 - content phone number and a link and an
12:53 - image so we need those all those in
12:55 - there so image title link
13:00 - huh huh looks like I thought there would
13:04 - be more info for the faculty but I think
13:07 - we're gonna have more info here all
13:12 - right so let's go phone and we'll call
13:18 - this staff node fun I'm just assuming
13:30 - that we've named that phone we'll have
13:31 - to double check and see what its gonna
13:33 - come through in our it come through like
13:36 - in our API and let me change the names
13:39 - of these because we don't want to say
13:41 - faculty we own all this to say staff
13:51 - this is multiple cursors feature so on a
13:55 - Mac on Visual Studio code I'm pressing
13:57 - command D to select them all and that
13:59 - lets me change them all all at a time
14:03 - like that so a lot of you probably know
14:06 - that but I frequently get questions when
14:08 - I do that so I thought I'd just just
14:10 - throw it out there now okay all right
14:17 - now would be a good time to make our
14:20 - query so that we can actually get some
14:22 - data in here and see what it looks like
14:24 - we'll also need to go to our server Jas
14:29 - file and make our route so that we can
14:31 - navigate to this page so let's do that
14:35 - first
14:37 - so I'm gonna check and see we should
14:40 - already have admissions in here oops if
14:44 - you all want to check out this code on
14:47 - your own the link for this repository is
14:51 - in the description it's all open source
14:52 - it's all one get up feel free to do what
14:54 - you want with it but I need to find
14:58 - where we're already setting routes for
15:03 - admissions here we are
15:05 - so for admissions when we get so this
15:10 - first set with page is is telling our
15:14 - application what component to use to
15:18 - render this route so what we want to say
15:23 - here is when you go to would be staff so
15:33 - when the ID coming through is staff we
15:36 - want you to use the staff list page and
15:45 - the type and the quit site it doesn't
15:52 - matter that doesn't matter for now in
15:56 - terms of what the type is gonna be but
16:00 - it will be it will matter in a minute if
16:04 - we get so far as to do the single staff
16:07 - member pages that will matter in our
16:09 - routes that might end up being a tricky
16:11 - one but we'll we'll figure it out when
16:14 - we get there okay so this should at
16:19 - least try to render that page which will
16:21 - probably give us an error now so we need
16:25 - to go into our queries and we're gonna
16:30 - take that faculty list query and copy it
16:40 - so let's make a staff so actually I'm
16:51 - not I'm not really happy about how we
16:54 - have the queries all separated out I
16:56 - think it might have been a better idea
16:58 - to put the queries in the component
17:01 - because we're not really reusing queries
17:04 - that much initially the idea was hey
17:07 - we're gonna reuse a lot of these queries
17:09 - but they end up not so a good refactor
17:12 - might be to add these in the components
17:14 - themselves but for now it works so we're
17:18 - gonna leave it alone so let's change the
17:21 - names here to staff instead of faculty
17:40 - okay and we need actually make sure that
17:43 - these fields are available to us so
17:45 - let's use a tool called graphical if I
17:50 - can find it
17:52 - alright so graphical is let me make
17:55 - everything bigger graphical is a really
17:59 - awesome tool so graph QL is I'm not sure
18:04 - what the right word I want almost static
18:06 - self-documenting right so you don't have
18:10 - to build like your own API Explorer when
18:13 - you use graph QL you can just put your
18:17 - endpoint URL into graphical and which is
18:21 - a Chrome extension right and then it it
18:25 - does this for you so let me just show
18:28 - you what's what's going on here we can
18:30 - go into here into our queries and then
18:32 - see all possible queries so let's search
18:35 - for staff and see staff member right so
18:39 - we can go a staff member and let's check
18:45 - out what what fields we can get from
18:47 - staff members so in particular we want
18:52 - to compare what we're getting here right
18:57 - to staff members so actually we know
19:01 - what we're going into the wrong way
19:03 - let's go back out I forgot we we're
19:06 - going to staff departments first okay so
19:13 - staff departments let's see if I can
19:18 - just pull this all in here
19:29 - did I get them wrong I think I got yeah
19:34 - I think I did that right all right let's
19:35 - see go ahead and and paste all of this
19:40 - in here
19:44 - all right so staff departments were
19:47 - named the slug equals I don't want it to
19:50 - be name I want it to be admissions see
20:03 - if that works
20:07 - No
20:09 - I'm not really that surprised that it
20:11 - didn't work
20:13 - unexpected name staff departments is
20:22 - unexpected
20:23 - all right wouldn't ready run
20:37 - we
20:45 - see
20:49 - yes staff departments actually let me
20:56 - check this out let's see what we had
20:58 - before that worked oh okay all right
21:07 - let's try that
21:16 - and I assume we'll need another curly
21:20 - braket let's see what happens now
21:22 - oh no unexpected single quote probably
21:26 - need double quotes alright oops and
21:36 - cannot query field staff on staff
21:39 - Department all right so what's the field
21:41 - this should automatically fill and staff
21:44 - members ok cool
21:47 - see if that works hey check it out
21:52 - alright cool so base like this really it
21:56 - lets us play with our queries in real
21:58 - time get results we don't have to be
22:01 - messing on in our files right and we can
22:05 - play with it here and then copy and
22:06 - paste it over and it only work so
22:10 - Michael in the live chat is saying
22:12 - there's only one department true there's
22:14 - only one department right now but
22:15 - they'll probably be more at some point
22:17 - so we're gonna plan on on more
22:24 - departments ok so let's see alright
22:28 - there's one thing that I still need
22:30 - title slow content featured image job
22:33 - title display name we don't have display
22:38 - name right when you take that out cuz
22:42 - that's not actually we can figure it out
22:45 - let's uh let's go into WordPress where
22:50 - we have all this data house and let's
22:53 - find stuff I've so many custom post
22:59 - types now I don't even bother looking
23:01 - through them I just just feel fine
23:04 - alright let's check out alright Corinne
23:09 - has all the data I believe so okay so
23:15 - okay we do have display name job title
23:18 - phone all right so that value probably
23:21 - is fun so I think we're good ok
23:27 - oops let me check my time real quick
23:34 - okay in about a little less than seven
23:37 - minutes I'm gonna come back to the chat
23:38 - and answer some questions so hang in
23:40 - there if you've if you asked a question
23:42 - so I I just need to put whoops just put
23:48 - phone in here phone field okay oops and
23:53 - I guess I need something else value
23:59 - there you go
24:00 - all right see that gives us what we need
24:07 - all right let me take content out of
24:09 - here for a second just cuz it's taking
24:11 - up all of space okay yeah so we have
24:16 - foam-filled value wonderful we have our
24:20 - slug I don't
24:28 - hmm actually I think our slugs gonna be
24:33 - okay
24:35 - but we should have
24:42 - let me see what our urls are so I want
24:46 - to make sure these right current source
24:48 - oh okay
24:48 - yeah that's right so I guess it is first
24:52 - name first it's the opposite of what we
24:54 - have for our faculty so staff is first
24:57 - name first um we're trying to match up
25:00 - the URLs to what's already there as much
25:02 - as possible all right so this works I
25:11 - believe we have everything that we need
25:13 - so let's copy this I'm just gonna go
25:17 - from where it says edges though so one
25:29 - two so we have two curly brackets in
25:34 - grab edges the reason so let me explain
25:43 - this a little bit more so we're getting
25:45 - first we're getting the department
25:47 - called admissions and within there we
25:51 - are getting all the staff members that
25:54 - are associated with that department and
25:57 - we're getting the last 100 right so I
26:01 - put 100 in there there's no way we're
26:03 - ever gonna have a hundred people in
26:04 - admissions unless we grow significantly
26:06 - as a school but that was a holdover from
26:10 - faculty where some of the departments
26:12 - are a little bit bigger
26:13 - no where's no one is near 100 no
26:15 - department but just wanted to be sure we
26:18 - don't leave anybody out and then we're
26:20 - gonna order them by alphabetically right
26:23 - by the the slug so that's what we're
26:26 - doing there and then within there we're
26:29 - just grabbing all these values from each
26:31 - staff member all right so we're getting
26:35 - just the data that we need no more no
26:39 - less so that's kind of the beauty of
26:41 - graph queue or actually if you look
26:43 - we're getting two different custom post
26:46 - types which would normally if we're
26:47 - using a REST API
26:48 - we'd have to hit two different endpoints
26:50 - for that but we only hit one endpoint
26:53 - and we're able to get the data from from
26:56 - both places so really cool you know the
26:59 - alternate way with the REST API we could
27:01 - hit one endpoint just the staff members
27:03 - but then we have to filter all of the
27:06 - staff members right by whatever category
27:10 - right by this admissions for the staff
27:13 - department category so grad Kiel just
27:16 - makes it a lot easier
27:17 - all right let's paste this in uh
27:20 - so from edges down here I should have
27:26 - paid attention to where this was okay so
27:30 - there we go I think this is where we
27:33 - need to be we're gonna paste that in and
27:39 - save it okay so assuming that I didn't
27:44 - miss any any names for the queries we
27:50 - should be getting some data now so we
27:53 - should be able to hit this endpoint so
27:55 - admissions staff should give us what we
28:00 - need so let's go here and you all might
28:04 - be able to hit the endpoint already
28:06 - admissions staff let's see what we get
28:12 - oh okay
28:15 - cannot resolve staff list item whoops we
28:20 - didn't make our component okay that
28:24 - makes sense
28:26 - let's see just for the sake of testing
28:32 - this quickly before my timer goes off
28:34 - let's change this back whoops
28:42 - let's change this component back oops
28:46 - staff list we'll change it back to
28:49 - faculty list
29:01 - because I think this would work
29:07 - let's see if it does okay
29:14 - no to undefined forest a flesh
29:21 - okay so what's undefined
29:24 - we should be getting slug stop node just
29:29 - my name oops
29:30 - are we getting let's see up here I think
29:38 - it should be staff member staff members
29:45 - yeah let's try staff members nope
29:52 - let's go back here and see yeah there's
29:56 - slug staff members right departments
30:03 - edges node staff members
30:14 - staff data sequence staff
30:25 - okay we're gonna have to troubleshoot
30:28 - when we get back let me set my Pomodoro
30:32 - timer here and let's fill out what we
30:38 - need so we've consumed one Pomodoro
30:40 - session right now so we're gonna put a 1
30:42 - there I'm gonna scroll way up to the top
30:47 - get to as many questions as I can rip on
30:54 - was talk something about an address
30:57 - account address you need to send to me
30:59 - I'm not really sure what you were
31:01 - talking about with the address so let me
31:03 - know
31:06 - Oshin says do you do any data analytics
31:12 - equal Python etc no I currently don't
31:15 - super interesting but haven't really had
31:19 - an opportunity to do anything with that
31:20 - yet let's see what text editor do you
31:26 - use Visual Studio code so Rev says
31:29 - tomorrow is my coding competition any
31:31 - advice I guess try to calm down as much
31:37 - as you can you know there's not you know
31:40 - all the work you put into this point is
31:42 - what's really gonna matter you know
31:43 - there's not really a whole lot you can
31:44 - do at this point so you you know might
31:47 - as well just chill right and try to do
31:50 - the best you can
31:51 - so you think yeah try to get some sleep
31:56 - to make sure you get good sleep
32:06 - Chaitanya uh correct me if that's the
32:10 - wrong pronunciation Chaitanya says
32:11 - what's the best resource to learn
32:12 - material you I their documentation is
32:16 - actually pretty good I don't know of any
32:18 - tutorials I definitely use it a lot in
32:22 - my videos my live streams so you may be
32:26 - able to learn some from the streams but
32:28 - it's not exactly a tutorial so I would
32:31 - say number one resource is their own
32:33 - documentation number two my videos I
32:38 - guess unless you can find
32:39 - other videos which are probably gonna be
32:41 - better for you Anthony says hi hey
32:46 - Anthony Jacobson says oh okay hi
32:51 - saying hi to Quincy from Haiti I did me
32:56 - it's cool I'm pretty pumped that Quincy
32:59 - is here as well
33:01 - let's see MD says awesome site Thank You
33:08 - Mohammed says what's the easiest way to
33:10 - learn coding I definitely recommend free
33:13 - code can't go to free code camp org and
33:15 - start some of those lessons I mean there
33:18 - if that's not your thing if you like
33:20 - videos you know check out the free code
33:22 - can you know videos if you like to read
33:25 - more you can check out the medium
33:27 - publication so that basically I'm not
33:30 - saying free code camps the only way to
33:32 - learn how to code but no matter what
33:34 - your learning style is we have you
33:37 - covered right so if you know there are
33:40 - definitely other good places Udacity
33:43 - code Academy there's other good YouTube
33:45 - channels as well so you know there's a
33:50 - there's a lot of options out there but
33:51 - the main thing is no matter what you
33:53 - choose and like to learn the material do
33:57 - a little bit every day much better do a
33:59 - little every day than to do a bunch of
34:01 - one day and then take a week off or
34:03 - something right
34:16 - frank says hi from khou-tv ivory West is
34:22 - West Africa hey how's it going thanks
34:24 - for watching
34:28 - Ambrose says nice Ambrose I love the
34:30 - name I named my my youngest son Ambrose
34:48 - Joe P says well I'm not sure if it
34:52 - supposed to be Joe P or Joep but says
34:55 - what are some fun projects to work on
34:57 - currently I don't know what to make you
34:59 - know there are some lists online and I
35:02 - believe on github - about like app ideas
35:04 - so I would check out those lists and
35:07 - just Google for like fun app ideas or
35:11 - something and you know people have whole
35:17 - lists of you know stuff different ideas
35:20 - that they've had so that's that's your
35:22 - best bet
35:25 - Mohammed says I'm doing some software
35:27 - engineering what language should I focus
35:29 - on more it definitely depends on what
35:33 - you're gonna work with but I agree with
35:35 - Quincy's comment
35:37 - starting with JavaScript JavaScript is
35:40 - very versatile so it's gonna give you a
35:42 - nice intro to programming and it's gonna
35:44 - allow you to work on a lot of different
35:46 - things so you can be eclipse you can
35:49 - make mobile apps you can even delve into
35:53 - machine learning VRA are data science
35:58 - like there's a lot of different areas
36:00 - javascript may not be like the main
36:02 - language for this particular area but it
36:04 - will let you have a little taste and see
36:06 - what you like and then if you you know
36:09 - feel the need to switch to another
36:11 - language to specialize you're already
36:13 - gonna have the basic programming
36:15 - concepts down so yeah so that's is
36:20 - anyway it's definitely good advice from
36:22 - from Quincy okay I'm gonna write down
36:26 - where I'm leaving off at and we're gonna
36:27 - go back and do at least one more
36:29 - Pomodoro session so
36:39 - okay alright so if I didn't get to your
36:44 - question this time I'll get to it next
36:46 - time let's start that Pomodoro session
36:49 - again and troubleshoots okay so here's
36:54 - what we'll do
36:58 - let's comment some stuff out and see if
37:02 - we can get it to render and then that'll
37:04 - give us an idea of where the the problem
37:07 - might be all right yeah so definitely
37:11 - not still not rendering okay
37:27 - we have anything in here so I might
37:32 - [Music]
37:46 - you know what let's just read this
37:50 - [Music]
38:07 - this whole section we're gonna get rid
38:09 - of and we're just gonna put in we should
38:19 - have put that in and let's see if we can
38:25 - get it to render now I still nothing
38:46 - all right so it seems like our routers
38:49 - working right so it's sorry this is so
38:51 - small I'm sorry let me zoom in so it
38:54 - seems like our routers working right we
38:56 - put an admission slash staff in for the
38:59 - URL and then it's trying to render pages
39:03 - staff list je s right that's what we
39:06 - wanted right the staff list jss what
39:09 - we're working on so it's there it's at
39:10 - that point the problem seems to be it's
39:14 - not finding the data that it needs so
39:23 - let's think about this
39:26 - what's it being sent for ID and type o
39:33 - [Music]
39:36 - all right let's check this out so for
39:39 - our faculty list I'm sorry our staff
39:42 - list let's get rid of that and let's get
39:47 - a staff list so for this for this name
39:52 - we're taking this this query string but
39:57 - we really just need it to be admissions
40:00 - for this one right so long term we may
40:03 - have other departments so right now we
40:05 - just have admission so maybe we could do
40:09 - this because I think we're getting the
40:10 - wrong value in I think that maybe the
40:16 - the problem so let's just pass it so
40:27 - into our query here
40:32 - we pass a name
40:41 - oops it's
40:49 - sorry let me think about this for a
40:51 - second are we even passing in props ID
40:58 - interesting so the type doesn't even
41:02 - really know weight this props tight
41:04 - alright that's what's getting passed
41:06 - into the staff list query
41:16 - so we not really even using the type hmm
41:26 - all right I may be missing it but it
41:30 - seems like we're passing in type and we
41:32 - don't need the type
41:42 - okay that's fine that's something that
41:45 - we can just refactor later it's not a
41:47 - huge deal but what we're gonna do here
41:50 - is we're we're gonna pass we're normally
41:53 - passing on this ID in instead we're
41:55 - gonna pass in admissions and now I think
42:05 - we're safe to bring these back at least
42:13 - some of them back oops
42:23 - are we in different stuff faculty list
42:31 - item is not defined
42:33 - oops
42:43 - yay okay cool
42:49 - all right that worked let's uncomment
42:52 - the rest now it's not gonna display the
42:57 - phone number now because we haven't told
43:00 - it to display the phone number we're
43:01 - just passing it in as a prop oops cannot
43:04 - read property phone of undefined whoops
43:07 - yeah so it's not just phone it's phone
43:11 - what did we call that let's go back to
43:16 - our query and phone field and then value
43:21 - so phone field value okay Oh fun field
43:33 - of undefined
43:40 - all right let's check this again
43:45 - fun-filled oops not staff listen staff
43:55 - there we are
44:03 - all right hey check that out okay so we
44:07 - have these cards now we're probably
44:13 - going to need changes change this up
44:15 - right so we currently now I mean maybe
44:22 - maybe there's room for you know some
44:25 - difference but currently there's this
44:28 - little message from from each one of our
44:31 - admissions staff members so we may have
44:36 - to switch it up to something more like
44:37 - this list or potentially if we wanted to
44:44 - keep that card look like we have now we
44:47 - could just you know make the cards full
44:50 - with that's another option so I'd say
45:02 - let me make sure I want to see if these
45:06 - what these links are doing if they're
45:08 - taking us to the right page
45:10 - no no yet I you know what I am I had to
45:14 - sign some of my student workers to
45:16 - change up these links cuz they're the
45:18 - wrong links were in them which one's
45:21 - gonna work I think yeah this one should
45:23 - work it's gonna give an error but I just
45:27 - want to make sure yet that that's the
45:29 - right URL okay all right cool so this
45:33 - page works like in terms of data and
45:37 - everything that works so that's usually
45:40 - the tricky part now we just need to
45:43 - render that that content right that we
45:48 - have that we have here and we need to
45:55 - render this this text me this little
45:58 - phone number here so that's where you
46:02 - now doctor wants me to update right now
46:06 - how about later okay my other screen I'm
46:09 - in these update notifications
46:14 - okay
46:27 - Michael s what's the route again it's
46:30 - it's Admissions / staff
46:40 - steak so we're gonna want to work with a
46:45 - different version of this faculty list
46:48 - item and we have
47:08 - I thought we already had a like a
47:11 - full-width component that we could use
47:13 - but I guess we don't see what this one
47:21 - is
47:28 - no this isn't it you know what we must
47:31 - have I or somebody else I don't remember
47:34 - who who did this particular one must
47:37 - have changed this faculty list item
47:39 - component at some point because it used
47:45 - to be full with all right let's uh while
47:48 - I'm in here I'm gonna switch up how our
47:51 - styles are done I'm gonna flip them here
47:55 - at the bottom okay and let's save that
47:59 - and then let's copy this and I hate to
48:04 - do this but this what we're gonna do
48:06 - we're just gonna copy this component
48:07 - make another component it's gonna be
48:14 - staff list item J s my stomach is like
48:18 - growling so I'm sorry if you if you have
48:20 - to hear that okay so we have a staff
48:29 - list item component and now let's get
48:32 - rid of this let's go to our staff list
48:36 - and change this up the staff list item
48:44 - and we'll change this back to staff list
48:47 - item okay now it should render this
48:55 - instead which right now it'll be the
48:57 - same thing should still render down the
49:00 - types of bells
49:07 - staff yeah yeah
49:13 - she's verify it works all right great
49:15 - so that works no we can start switching
49:21 - things up so first thing we can do just
49:24 - to see how these cards will look for
49:26 - with is change it up we're using this
49:32 - grid we can just get rid of all these
49:34 - grid sizes and keep this extra small 12
49:37 - this is a built-in component into
49:40 - material UI which is our component
49:43 - library so on extra small screens this
49:48 - grid item is going to take up 12 out of
49:52 - 12 columns so the full width all right
49:55 - that's what we're saying here and since
49:56 - we haven't indicated any other size up
49:59 - from there it's just gonna use this
50:01 - value for every screen size so that's
50:06 - the first thing we're gonna do let's
50:08 - save that see how it looks see if we get
50:10 - some more space okay it looks like we
50:12 - may have a max width on these on these
50:15 - cards hmm okay not not a huge deal let's
50:25 - let's do some more and then see how we
50:27 - need to change up that that max width
50:31 - okay we need to change this is fine with
50:40 - the name and the title that's perfect
50:43 - that's what we want this is also perfect
50:44 - we just need to add some stuff in here
50:46 - so within our
50:54 - it's okay so job titles so we're gonna
51:00 - continue here all of these are like
51:03 - conditionals so if we get a profile link
51:07 - prop past n then we render this okay so
51:10 - that saves us from getting errors if we
51:14 - have incomplete data right so let's say
51:17 - somebody adds a new staff member but
51:19 - they don't put in a link for them well
51:23 - we're not it's not gonna be an error if
51:25 - we do it like this it's just not gonna
51:27 - show the link because we don't have one
51:28 - so that's why we're doing everything
51:31 - conditionally so let's say this part is
51:36 - I don't know content I'm gonna call it
51:40 - content let's add this here so we're
51:46 - listing out all our props here and then
51:50 - here we're gonna say phone as well so
51:55 - we're gonna say content so if there is
51:58 - content then after the end then we're
52:04 - gonna we're gonna render the content
52:09 - inside of this so we're gonna use
52:13 - typography and the component we're gonna
52:19 - give it as just a P that might be the
52:22 - default so it might not be necessary and
52:27 - [Music]
52:29 - within this
52:34 - I don't know why it's not automatically
52:37 - doing that anyway let's render our
52:46 - content
52:56 - okay so within that okay and actually
53:03 - that's we could have probably done that
53:07 - all in one line because it's such a
53:09 - small amount but this will work so what
53:14 - they should do is give us the content
53:16 - wrapped in a P tag so let's see see if
53:24 - we keep going the wrong way it doesn't
53:32 - look like we got it all right let's
53:36 - inspect this to see what happened
53:44 - yeah it's nothing all right let's go
53:48 - back here and see why content maybe we
53:55 - didn't pass it in as content yeah we
54:01 - didn't pass in content at all which I'm
54:09 - assuming it's gonna be staff node
54:11 - content so let's see how that goes
54:16 - see but since we had that conditional we
54:19 - didn't get an error right
54:23 - we were conditionally rendering so it
54:26 - said hey you didn't pass in the prop
54:28 - content so we're not gonna do anything
54:30 - which is what we wanted to happen
54:36 - there's still nothing maybe that was the
54:39 - wrong check out our console didn't get
54:44 - anything in there
54:45 - okay now let's double check and our
54:53 - query just to see woops you know what
54:57 - remember we took out content corral
55:00 - content never put it back in we're also
55:03 - gonna need to do something special with
55:05 - content here you'll see in a second so
55:08 - the contents coming in with all the HTML
55:12 - tags included right so here's how we
55:15 - fixed that this is gonna look like it's
55:18 - not the right thing to do but it's fine
55:21 - as long as you control the data coming
55:24 - in you never want to do this if you're
55:26 - allowing you know just anyone to put in
55:28 - the data and display it right but we're
55:30 - gonna say enter dangerously set enter
55:42 - HTML and then that's where we're gonna
55:47 - put in
55:48 - I believe it's like HTML content I think
55:55 - that's how you do it
55:57 - and in that case we're just going to use
56:03 - oh no no no what's going on here it's
56:10 - secured rid of that there we go whoops
56:27 - said how we doing know
56:36 - am i doing wrong
56:43 - maybe I don't need that all right let's
56:45 - just try it with content and see what
56:47 - happens no
56:54 - yeah I am oh you know what I think I
56:56 - need to double underscores let's try
56:58 - that
57:07 - Oh
57:14 - all right I may have to look this up
57:17 - James you said under HTML equals all
57:25 - right let's look it up
58:10 - am i doing wrong
58:15 - if anybody sees what I'm doing wrong
58:17 - please let me know in the live chat
58:18 - otherwise let's try to figure out what's
58:22 - happening okay so it's possible we can't
58:33 - do this in a typography component so
58:36 - before I let's just try this in a normal
58:41 - P tag first see what's going on
58:55 - still be a minute here whoops
59:04 - all right here it says you have the
59:08 - slash before closing of the typography
59:21 - yeah I was trying to close it there Oh
59:24 - double we're passing an object thank you
59:30 - mate mayor let me know if I'm
59:34 - pronouncing that wrong okay that makes a
59:37 - lot more sense we need double so it all
59:43 - right yeah for this this example wasn't
59:46 - like what we were doing so that's why I
59:48 - didn't show this but we need that double
59:50 - so let's just see how it looks with the
59:52 - P we can switch it back to typography in
59:54 - a second so we're passing in an object
59:57 - whoa interesting we got it for a second
60:03 - and then it went away that's weird we
60:10 - had that happen before I can't remember
60:14 - why it happened though I can't remember
60:16 - how we fix it if anybody remembers how
60:18 - we fixed that before let me know alright
60:22 - but that came up for a second let's use
60:27 - typography though let's see if we can
60:32 - get it to work with typography all right
60:37 - wonderful works with typography and it
60:40 - doesn't go away so what we can see right
60:44 - this is is taking up a lot more and why
60:47 - does this say about me is that really
60:52 - what we have in here Wow I definitely
61:00 - don't want that and I don't want their
61:03 - phone number right there that's weird
61:09 - and their phone number is actually
61:11 - different why is the phone number
61:15 - different
61:18 - i'ma have to remember that and send a
61:22 - message to my student workers to have
61:26 - them go in here and clean that up and
61:28 - make sure that everything is actually
61:30 - working
61:41 - that's so weird it's a totally different
61:44 - phone number all right
61:46 - okay my timer is up for that Pomodoro
61:49 - session let's take another break and let
61:53 - me go back to where I left off in the
61:55 - chat so three okay Lucy says could
62:10 - somebody tell me which video is a video
62:12 - where this project starts okay so this
62:14 - project has its own playlist so it's
62:17 - it's project five so you can go to the
62:21 - project five playlist on this YouTube
62:25 - channel and it should be in an order I
62:29 - don't remember if I have it in
62:31 - chronological order or reverse
62:33 - chronological order
62:35 - but anyway that playlist has everything
62:38 - so it should say day one
62:50 - Aaron says hello hey how's it going
62:56 - Abba car says I want to re-watch this
62:59 - yeah for sure
63:01 - it'll be available as a video on YouTube
63:05 - basically like a few minutes after it's
63:07 - over
63:10 - Nina says what's WordPress got to do
63:13 - with the react app that's where we're
63:14 - pulling the data from so you don't
63:17 - WordPress has nothing to do with react
63:20 - really but that happens to be one of our
63:23 - sources of data for this project they
63:26 - said our only source right now
63:28 - all right well not really cuz we're
63:31 - grabbing some stuff from cloud datastore
63:37 - Google cloud cloud bucket so yeah but it
63:42 - doesn't WordPress doesn't really matter
63:44 - it could be anywhere that we're getting
63:46 - the data from but it happens to be
63:48 - WordPress for this project
63:51 - Cory asked what Pomodoro timer I'm using
63:54 - this is pom-pom dot now dot Sh
63:58 - let me copy and paste this in here so
64:01 - one of our live stream viewers
64:07 - Harshit who contributed significantly to
64:09 - a lot of these projects
64:11 - Harshit created this timer so it's
64:14 - pretty sweet and I use it all the time
64:17 - for my projects if any of you created a
64:19 - Pomodoro timer and want me to check it
64:21 - out and show it on the stream please
64:24 - send me the link don't try to send it in
64:26 - the chat because it always blocks the
64:28 - links you can DM it to me on Twitter or
64:32 - I'm on like all the social media so just
64:35 - check the link in the description for my
64:37 - youtube channel and then from there I
64:39 - have links out to all my social media
64:41 - and and you can just message me on any
64:44 - one of them with the link and all I'll
64:46 - try to use it on my one one of my
64:49 - upcoming streams but see Erin says I'm
64:55 - learning react right now question is how
64:57 - do you get rid of this kind of imports
65:00 - where you have the dog dog flash
65:03 - something dot s CSS Bjorn says Aaron
65:07 - look at literal imports okay yeah check
65:10 - that out I'm I'm not like a hundred
65:13 - percent sure about the question for that
65:16 - so I'm just gonna go with the Oren's
65:18 - answer here and if you check it out and
65:22 - that's not wishing you need maybe kind
65:25 - of a skating ask question again down
65:27 - lower we can get to it a little bit
65:28 - later let's see silento says hey hey
65:39 - how's it going let me know if I didn't
65:41 - pronounce your name right
65:42 - lol Marsha says hello hey Cal yoke says
65:48 - hello bro how are you not bad I'm pretty
65:52 - good busy day busy day today but I'm
65:57 - feeling good and excited about getting
65:59 - this project done how are you doing
66:07 - Catherina says hey hey how's it going
66:11 - Austin says hello why was the decision
66:13 - made to switch from WordPress to react
66:16 - so we didn't switch from WordPress to
66:18 - react were switched from Extron which is
66:21 - an old content management system based
66:24 - on the.net framework so react is being
66:29 - used to build this we just happen to be
66:31 - storing a lot of the data in WordPress
66:34 - as a content management system because
66:37 - it's easy for people who don't know any
66:39 - code to enter data into WordPress also
66:44 - comes built in with a nice REST API and
66:46 - with the WP graph QL plug-in we can also
66:50 - grab data with graph QL
66:57 - okay Oh spoon would said the company
67:01 - isn't legible in Mayan I'm sorry I'll
67:04 - try to adjust the the font size now okay
67:09 - let me check my time all right let's do
67:12 - one more problem adoro session you
67:14 - usually don't do three I mostly do too
67:18 - but I really want to finish this you
67:21 - know get it looking a little bit nicer
67:28 - okay all right so I'm gonna go back now
67:37 - we'll do one more Pomodoro session oops
67:40 - and I forgot to change this too it looks
67:44 - like my estimate is gonna be spot-on I
67:46 - think we'll get this finished in one
67:48 - more Pomodoro session okay so here's
67:52 - what we're looking at right now oh I do
67:55 - have to remember to get this data make
67:59 - sure the data is correct for this one
68:03 - though I'm gonna I think manually take
68:05 - this about me out just so I can see what
68:08 - it looks like without it I really don't
68:11 - don't need that in there refresh that
68:18 - should be gone there we are
68:21 - whoa shoot and did it again
68:37 - all right I'm gonna have to go back and
68:39 - look at some of the old streams and
68:41 - remember why why this was happening okay
68:56 - content coming in there we need our
68:58 - phone number so let's pop in that phone
69:00 - number here and I want to
69:12 - you know let's grab this for now and
69:14 - just use this to put in our phone number
69:19 - okay whoa wait a second count east you
69:26 - know we had this decode HTML function in
69:30 - here the whole time and I forgot about
69:31 - it okay
69:36 - this projects been going on so long I
69:39 - don't even remember what's in it now to
69:43 - be honest I didn't write this this
69:45 - function somebody else did this and I
69:46 - can't remember who did it so if you're
69:48 - the one that did that let me know and I
69:50 - will give you a proper shoutout for this
69:52 - but thank you for writing this all right
69:56 - so let's let's do this properly let's
70:04 - get rid of dangerously set enter HTML
70:11 - after all that and I don't even need it
70:14 - okay and we're just gonna put in the
70:19 - code HTML we're gonna add content in
70:24 - there and that's gonna take care of our
70:27 - issues with the HTML and add typography
70:34 - in there wonderful and then in here
70:37 - we're gonna put phone which I believe
70:41 - that is what we brought that in as we'll
70:45 - figure it out if it doesn't work so we
70:48 - got a phone coming in there and probably
70:53 - could yeah let's leave it like that
70:57 - we'll see if we actually need a label
71:00 - like right now the current site has a
71:02 - label it says like text me or something
71:05 - like that I don't know that we need that
71:08 - oh no it's not working
71:16 - hmm our decode HTML was not working
71:23 - why not because I guess it was it was
71:33 - not meant to do that
71:39 - let me go back let's go back to the way
71:43 - it was even though it didn't work we'll
71:48 - figure that out later all right let me
71:53 - switch this up and I'll put in phone
72:01 - it's you good whoops no no no okay we
72:07 - definitely need to make this bigger
72:13 - let's take a look at what we're doing
72:15 - here with our alright so we have a max
72:17 - height we have a height Animax with okay
72:21 - we don't need to worry about the height
72:22 - the height really comes into play when
72:24 - you have multiple columns because you
72:27 - want them to be the same height if
72:28 - they're all gonna be in a row it won't
72:30 - look as weird right if they're the same
72:33 - height and we have this max width of 600
72:35 - pixels let's bump that up to 1200 and
72:39 - see what it looks like woah wow that's a
72:49 - lot of content let's I didn't realize
72:54 - there's that much content in some of
72:55 - these okay let's check this out let's
72:57 - check out Barnardo's entry here and see
73:06 - let's see what we can do
73:13 - you know what we need we're definitely
73:16 - going to need to have we need to have an
73:21 - excerpt for each one of these and then
73:25 - the full amount of content okay yeah so
73:32 - we just we need some work here and again
73:34 - the phone numbers wrong I don't know
73:40 - what happened there okay
73:45 - [Music]
73:52 - all right so let's look at one where the
73:55 - the data is actually more realistic here
73:58 - so this one is is more realistic so
74:05 - let's get rid of yeah let's go and I'm
74:08 - just going to manually edit this one for
74:15 - Corinne worse yet I just I just need one
74:22 - example of what the data is supposed to
74:25 - be and if that looks okay then we're
74:28 - good and then I can just assign someone
74:31 - to correct all the rest of the data put
74:40 - that in there like that
74:42 - and this format okay now let's get rid
74:50 - of all this
74:57 - okay
75:01 - now we'll update that and hopefully get
75:06 - a better idea of what this is gonna look
75:08 - like oops
75:24 - see
75:31 - all right that's killing me why am I
75:41 - I cannot remember
75:42 - [Music]
75:52 - it's the phone number shown on yeah I
75:55 - know show no maybe it it has something
75:58 - to do with uh setting the dangerously
76:03 - set under HTML
76:35 - all right well regardless of what's
76:38 - going on here the images are
76:44 - [Music]
76:51 - kind of see like this image is
76:54 - definitely not a big enough image for
76:57 - the student to work so we need we may
77:06 - need a different solution cards might
77:08 - not be the the solution here you know if
77:12 - we could do more like well more like we
77:16 - have here where they're just separated
77:18 - out with just a little divider maybe
77:24 - that might be better okay all right
77:35 - mayor says it's because of nesting P
77:37 - tags awesome awesome
77:40 - I yeah that's that's gotta be it
77:47 - okay so let's check this out
77:50 - why is
77:56 - okay
78:09 - let's see if we can put in
78:23 - yep that was it so this is a pee tag and
78:27 - then WordPress is putting in adding in a
78:31 - pee tag I believe that's what's
78:33 - happening so it's just that was the
78:36 - problem before okay so now we have a
78:38 - better idea
78:40 - but obviously the image is messed up
78:45 - here I wonder if our image has a max
78:51 - just this image type of max height what
78:58 - are we putting on the air
79:03 - yep the image has a max height whoa yeah
79:10 - this is no good well now actually it's
79:14 - not gonna be this this long so this is
79:17 - more reasonable
79:19 - this one this one got a more reasonable
79:22 - size but we get down here like the image
79:27 - size is just not good enough to handle
79:30 - that and that's not even that long
79:47 - all right like content-wise this is
79:49 - going to be okay once we get the content
79:51 - switched around but the images are going
79:57 - to be an issue
80:08 - yeah
80:12 - now let's see what we're doing here with
80:14 - images for common time
80:38 - where's that max-width coming in there
80:42 - max height I'm sorry oh okay
80:52 - sir CSS
80:58 - hmm
81:00 - let's see if we can remove this CSS file
81:03 - completely and if it if it's okay
81:20 - so we are bringing in in our staff list
81:26 - page we're pulling in this faculty list
81:29 - CSS let's comment this out and see what
81:37 - happens
81:43 - you know refreshes to be sure I did
81:49 - nothing all right I think this is fine
81:54 - everything looks oh no way you know what
81:58 - it went back to this I thought we just
82:06 - took this out
82:07 - Oh faculty lysias this is the season's
82:11 - probably wanted to take out all right
82:14 - let's bring this back in even though I
82:16 - didn't really see any difference okay
82:23 - all right so that did make a difference
82:26 - suspect just to verify yeah we're not
82:29 - pulling that in anymore
82:40 - okay I'd say at this point that's about
82:42 - all we can do until we get the data
82:45 - switched around because when we're gonna
82:51 - be pulling from a different area instead
82:52 - of pulling in from the content we're
82:54 - gonna pull in from the excerpt at least
82:57 - for this so we'll leave it as is the
83:02 - only other thing that I guess I'd like
83:03 - to do maybe is make this a clickable
83:10 - phone number see how much time we have
83:17 - yeah ten minutes all right we can make
83:19 - this a clickable phone number and then
83:24 - yeah I kind of want to think about these
83:27 - pictures and see just kind of think more
83:31 - about how I really want to display these
83:46 - these are the these are the actual sizes
83:49 - of some of these images so yeah you see
83:52 - some of them are just not well yeah
83:57 - they're not nearly big enough to be able
83:59 - to fit the card sizes that we're gonna
84:01 - have so we need to rethink yeah we
84:07 - definitely need to rethink this or get
84:12 - images that work even this placeholder
84:18 - images is it big enough we get probably
84:22 - using SVG for this instead that might
84:25 - not be a bad idea okay yes
84:40 - let's go to where our phone number is
84:43 - being pulled in wait a second how we
84:54 - gonna do this we just need the the raw
85:00 - number it's gonna be a little bit harder
85:04 - than I thought
85:05 - so now let's see I've never tried to do
85:10 - this before you'll see what I'm talking
85:11 - about in a second let's let's let's just
85:16 - try it for staff list item we're gonna
85:20 - take where we're putting in our phone
85:24 - number here and we're gonna do an object
85:29 - so what is called a template literal
85:32 - sorry template literal it's es6 or yes
85:36 - 2015 syntax so actually let's let's do
85:42 - this
85:42 - so we're gonna do ya within our
85:45 - JavaScript we're gonna make a string and
85:49 - inside that string we're gonna say yes
85:56 - it's gonna be within a span and we're
86:00 - gonna put in an a tag and then our href
86:05 - is gonna say tell write and then we're
86:11 - gonna drop back into JavaScript land
86:13 - we're gonna put in phone which I don't
86:19 - think we need to Dakota HTML on phone
86:21 - cuz it comes through as a number anyway
86:24 - so we could probably get rid of it here
86:25 - as well and I think we'll be fine all
86:30 - right so we're pulling in our phone
86:32 - there our phone number so we need to
86:37 - close out those quotes we can close out
86:40 - this a tag we're gonna put in
86:45 - another variable right so we got to put
86:48 - it in the dollar sign curly brackets and
86:51 - then we're gonna close out our a tag and
86:56 - then we'll close out our string put in
86:59 - on another curly bracket to close out
87:01 - JavaScript let's make sure did this work
87:05 - why are you not working I think it works
87:12 - it's just the syntax there we are
87:14 - the syntax highlighting needed to catch
87:15 - up okay so what they should do is make
87:18 - this link clickable with a phone number
87:21 - here let's see if it works oh no all
87:35 - right it took all the because I have it
87:40 - in typography that's why I did it okay
87:41 - we're not gonna be able to do this
87:44 - within typography
87:49 - let's see if we can switch this up let's
88:00 - you know what let's just put this into a
88:03 - span
88:15 - I like to use typography where I can it
88:18 - comes with material UI and basically it
88:19 - applies a standard for all your fonts
88:25 - right but when I run into stuff like
88:30 - that it's just a lot easier to drop back
88:32 - down into you know your regular HTML
88:34 - tags so we'll see how it looks
88:37 - hmm
88:46 - you know what I don't need this anymore
88:48 - what am i doing okay
88:53 - that was my problem that will at least
88:57 - that time okay so now what we can do
89:00 - here is get rid of this get rid of that
89:08 - and oops we are gonna still need that
89:11 - ready
89:28 - unless it's just my syntax highlighting
89:31 - messing me up alright let's see I might
89:39 - not have needed to do that I think my
89:41 - syntax highlighting maybe he just was a
89:43 - little bit behind and that's why it
89:44 - looked weird okay but check it out okay
89:47 - we have this clickable number let's see
89:51 - if it works
89:52 - yeah it's asking me to open FaceTime I
89:55 - don't want to but here's what I was
89:57 - worried about though you can't really
89:59 - see it but when I hover over it as the
90:02 - the tail number it gives me the number
90:04 - formatted exactly like this I wasn't
90:07 - sure if that would be valid if it would
90:09 - work so that was my only thing I guess
90:14 - we'll have to test that out for sure to
90:16 - make sure it still works cool
90:24 - but now mm why did it not work oh you
90:35 - know what some of these people probably
90:38 - don't have phone numbers put in so this
90:39 - is just what was in the content section
90:42 - so that'll be that'll be better whenever
90:48 - we get the content put in properly okay
90:52 - cool so yeah so that's pretty much it's
91:00 - pretty much done like I said the only
91:02 - thing we're gonna do is switch it up so
91:04 - instead of cards these will be just rows
91:06 - with a little horizontal line in between
91:11 - them and what that'll allow us to do is
91:13 - use different size images it won't look
91:17 - as weird so it won't be as obvious that
91:19 - the images are different size we won't
91:22 - have weird stuff like this happening
91:24 - we'll just let the images be with their
91:27 - normal sizes it'll look for some of the
91:30 - images it will look strange because
91:32 - they'll be way small we'll just set a
91:35 - maximum limit on what the images can do
91:38 - so we won't have gigantic ones on the
91:40 - page
91:40 - and then we can always go in later and
91:44 - get better images you know you may have
91:47 - to have our photographers so my
91:48 - department we have photography people so
91:51 - we may have to have them go actually
91:53 - take a photo and then we can get
91:56 - whatever size we want but that's not
91:59 - realistic before launch right so we'll
92:02 - make it look as good as we can for now
92:04 - and later on and you know one day if we
92:09 - happen to have all the images we need at
92:11 - the exact size we need we could switch
92:13 - up to something like this if we thought
92:14 - it was nicer but I think this looks fine
92:16 - right now well what I just described
92:20 - will look fine
92:21 - right yeah so but I'm gonna end of shame
92:25 - because we've been doing this for quite
92:26 - a while and I'm getting pretty hungry so
92:31 - you just want to give you a heads up on
92:33 - what's gonna happen with this if if
92:36 - anybody really wants to jump in and
92:38 - start doing some of this feel free to
92:39 - open a pull request I need to catch up
92:42 - and make sure I sign some of those tasks
92:44 - I talked about and if there's anything I
92:48 - need to put into an issue and get up
92:50 - I'll do that as well and I need to push
92:52 - out some of this code to the github
92:53 - repository shell can see it and work on
92:55 - it so that'll be the number one thing I
92:58 - do anyway and the stream is I'll push
93:00 - this stuff to get up right now actually
93:03 - let me push it to get up right now
93:05 - because I'm gonna answer some questions
93:06 - that might take a look I want to make
93:09 - sure if whoever wants to see this code
93:11 - can see it immediately I'm gonna do a
93:14 - git status just to see what's changed
93:17 - okay I realize that I've changed some
93:19 - other stuff that's somewhat unrelated
93:21 - I'm not gonna do a separate commit for
93:23 - that mainly just because of time I just
93:26 - want to get through this commit and get
93:27 - to the questions so we're gonna do a get
93:30 - add and I'm just gonna put a dot to add
93:32 - everything yarn cm okay so we have a
93:36 - little kind of automated thing set up to
93:39 - help us do a nicer commit message than
93:41 - normal
93:41 - if you don't have this set up it's
93:43 - called committed and if you don't have
93:44 - this set up then you just want to do a
93:47 - regular get commit preferably with the
93:51 - EM flag so you can put the message right
93:52 - in line we're gonna say we had
93:54 - new feature because we did and let's say
93:56 - we add staff list page and staff list
94:09 - item component yeah we did a bit more
94:14 - than that we did queries and stuff but
94:16 - if anybody really wants to dig into that
94:19 - commit they'll see what changed
94:22 - no breaking changes and I don't think
94:27 - that affects any open issues so we're
94:30 - gonna leave it alone if it did effect an
94:31 - issue we can put it in right there and
94:33 - it would automatically get tagged or
94:35 - closed that issue so tests are gonna run
94:41 - will see if they pass we may have to
94:45 - update our unit test I'm hoping we don't
94:50 - all right cool it looks like we won't I
94:54 - don't know those were in dentists where
94:58 - it was it yeah
95:08 - all right cool we passed everything I'm
95:10 - gonna do a get push ok now everything
95:15 - should be up to date on the gate repo if
95:17 - it's not up to date for you refresh it
95:19 - it should be now I'm gonna go where we
95:24 - left off at in the chat control 30 and I
95:31 - need to take a drink because I've been
95:33 - talking a lot I'm going to drink some G
95:37 - fuel if anybody works for G fuel and
95:42 - you're watching I'm open for a
95:44 - sponsorship
95:58 - okay
96:02 - okay Julio as if I will upload a stream
96:07 - of UJS I don't have any plans to do that
96:10 - anytime soon because my streams are
96:13 - almost always what I'm doing for work
96:15 - and right now we're doing pretty much
96:18 - everything with react
96:19 - I do think it'd be cool to work with you
96:22 - so if I'm gonna work with you it'll
96:23 - probably be a side project in that case
96:26 - I'm a stream it may be just on my on my
96:30 - youtube channel so if you're interested
96:32 - in saying that to tell you truth for
96:34 - those of you who subscribe to my channel
96:36 - my my personal channel you know I've
96:38 - been slacking on that lately so I
96:40 - apologize I have a whole list of topics
96:42 - for videos that you all have requested
96:45 - from me I really really want to get to
96:47 - that I mean things are just always busy
96:50 - right not only with work and with my
96:54 - clients on the side but also you know I
96:57 - have four kids so I'm gonna really try
97:03 - to put out some content because I know a
97:05 - lot of you are subscribed to that and I
97:08 - don't want to leave you hanging and I
97:10 - know even some of you have gone onto my
97:13 - patreon and are helping to support me in
97:16 - doing that so I haven't forgot about it
97:21 - I do want to put out content so I'm
97:27 - gonna try to make it a priority after I
97:29 - get this site launched which will
97:30 - hopefully happen next week that's just
97:35 - gonna take a lot off me mentally and
97:37 - time was so I'm hoping I'll I'll be able
97:41 - to do that so if anybody has any ideas
97:43 - for stuff they really want to see for me
97:45 - to either do a stream or pre-recorded
97:48 - video on my youtube channel please let
97:51 - me know you can put it in a lab chat
97:52 - here you can DM me or whatever you want
97:54 - I'll add it to my list of stuff and and
97:58 - hopefully get something made soon
98:09 - Lewis says hello hey how's it going
98:12 - Matthew asked where did you study so if
98:18 - you wondering where I studied coding I
98:21 - did that on my own so mainly free code
98:25 - camp code Academy Udacity I think I did
98:31 - like one udemy course or you to me
98:33 - I'm sure you pronounced that a ton of
98:36 - YouTube tutorial videos dev tips channel
98:42 - was really active back in the day and I
98:44 - watched them same way with learn code
98:46 - Academy Channel they're still around
98:49 - there's not as active let's see I mean
98:54 - books blog art blog post documentation
98:57 - you know all that in terms of like
99:00 - formal studies my degree my undergrad
99:03 - degree is in business I specialized in
99:06 - particular in economics and finance and
99:10 - I did that at West Liberty University in
99:13 - West Virginia in the United States so
99:16 - literally this school was like in the
99:19 - mountains right and in this tiny little
99:21 - town with cows there's not even a gas
99:24 - station but it was a nice little school
99:28 - it felt like you're in a private school
99:31 - but it was actually the cheapest school
99:33 - in the state and West Virginia is one of
99:35 - the poorest states in the United States
99:37 - so I didn't have any student loans
99:39 - because it was so cheap which is great
99:44 - anyway if you want to know more in
99:48 - detail about my studies you can ask me
99:50 - stuff and and I'll answer let's see I
99:58 - lost my place sorry
100:03 - William says this is great awesome I'm
100:06 - glad you like it
100:22 - albrecht says view j/s is well the
100:26 - greater than sign so if UJS overreact
100:30 - i don't know i haven't really used view
100:32 - so i can't say i've heard good things
100:33 - about you but my take on now granted
100:39 - I've never used view so take that into
100:41 - consideration my take on view versus
100:45 - react at this point is I see a lot more
100:51 - jobs for react than I do for view it
100:54 - could just be because I develop with
100:56 - react so I get targeted stuff you know
101:00 - that coming
101:00 - you know when recruiters reach out to me
101:02 - it's with react stuff so who knows but
101:07 - react is used as far as I know react is
101:11 - used by more more companies and there
101:15 - are more react out there okay maybe it
101:18 - won't always be like that but that to me
101:21 - gives react the edge if your goal is to
101:23 - try to get a job you know with an
101:26 - established company if that's not your
101:28 - goal and you just want to build cool
101:29 - stuff and you know go with you
101:32 - also I mean I just I really I do like
101:34 - react I think they have a good team
101:36 - behind react there's a good ecosystem of
101:38 - things that work with react like
101:40 - material you I react router so anyway
101:46 - that's my take on it
101:48 - I have I have no hate for view though
101:52 - right I'm not I have nothing bad to say
101:54 - about view so if you like view that's
101:57 - awesome I think there are people making
101:59 - awesome things with you and with react
102:02 - and with angular and probably with a ton
102:03 - of other things so my thing is you just
102:08 - you got to use what's right for you and
102:10 - for your project you know based on the
102:14 - requirements of that project and and
102:16 - your abilities
102:22 - albrecht says you takes most nice things
102:25 - from react to an angular it's just as
102:29 - you may see on github view leads but of
102:32 - course it's personal stuff which you
102:33 - could yeah yeah I agree that's true view
102:36 - did surpass in terms of stars on github
102:39 - view did surpass reacts so that's true
102:44 - which I mean I don't know what's as a
102:47 - metric you know stars are kind of
102:50 - ambiguous right you know what does that
102:53 - really mean
102:54 - right that's what to me like for me
102:58 - personally like I love coding coding
103:01 - would be my hobby if I didn't already do
103:03 - it all the time and get paid for it but
103:05 - you know coding primarily for most
103:07 - people I think is a way to make money
103:10 - right so I think a more valuable metric
103:16 - for a framework if you're trying to make
103:18 - money is how many companies are already
103:21 - using it right have they invested in it
103:23 - because they're not likely to switch
103:25 - right most companies once they invest in
103:28 - something especially the bigger
103:31 - companies they're not gonna switch for a
103:33 - while so even if it turns out that view
103:36 - is actually better than anything else
103:38 - nobody's gonna switch the view if
103:40 - they've already put in money and to
103:42 - react or angular they're gonna stick
103:44 - with it for at least a couple of years
103:45 - so in terms of that like finding a job
103:50 - even if you is better I'm not saying
103:52 - one's better than the other but the
103:54 - suppose like let's suppose view was
103:56 - better just the fact that so many
103:58 - companies are already invested in
104:00 - angular and react is gonna say okay well
104:03 - I might have a hard time harder time
104:05 - finding a job with you as opposed to
104:08 - react alright but so that's I I usually
104:13 - recommend react for those reasons has
104:17 - nothing to do with the quality of you as
104:19 - as a library alright Joe says hi there I
104:26 - am
104:27 - a master's engineering in computer
104:30 - science with six years experience and
104:35 - C++ Linux real time then seven years
104:39 - into teaching what are my chances of
104:42 - reorienting my career again as a
104:44 - full-stack developer well to be honest
104:46 - with you I mean youyou have a very
104:49 - impressive background so if you can
104:53 - catch yourself up on some of the latest
104:56 - in the full-stack world then I think
105:00 - you're fine I mean you you probably have
105:04 - a better grasp on computer science like
105:07 - foundational principles then you know 90
105:11 - plus percent of people on full stack out
105:14 - there all right and that's nothing
105:15 - against those people it's just you know
105:18 - a lot of people that are full stack
105:20 - developers right now you know the newer
105:24 - developers probably didn't get a
105:26 - traditional computer science education
105:28 - because they didn't really need it to
105:29 - get a job or to do their job right so I
105:32 - think you have a value especially it
105:35 - seems like larger companies like some of
105:39 - your leaders in tech when you look at
105:41 - their job descriptions they they tend to
105:43 - favor people with a stronger computer
105:46 - science background that may be changing
105:49 - but from what I've seen you know I'm
105:51 - thinking of like Google you know looking
105:53 - at some Google jobs they definitely like
105:57 - that if you have a strong computer
105:58 - science background even if you're going
106:00 - to be a front-end engineer it's it's
106:03 - still there at least it was the last
106:07 - time I checked out a job description so
106:10 - that's going to be a definite like plus
106:14 - for you you your thing would just be you
106:17 - need to prove to companies that you can
106:19 - build modern applications with the
106:24 - latest technology so you're gonna want
106:25 - to brush up on something like react you
106:28 - angular build some progressive web apps
106:32 - to put in your portfolio that's I I
106:38 - don't think as long as
106:41 - you are gonna enjoy it and be able to
106:44 - you know switch and learn things you
106:46 - know quickly I I think you'll be you
106:51 - know very valuable if I was looking to
106:53 - hire someone and you had that background
106:56 - plus you had some really nice stuff in
106:59 - your portfolio in terms of like modern
107:01 - web apps like my only thing would be
107:05 - like I don't know if I can pay this
107:06 - person enough to want to come here
107:08 - really because I think you're you're
107:11 - definitely in a good position
107:23 - Nino's says what is with styles I see
107:25 - that a lot in your app yeah so that's
107:28 - just what we need to use for form it's
107:31 - your UI when we want to pull in our see
107:37 - if I can find an example real quick
107:40 - so we have this with styles in here and
107:44 - that allows us to pull in and just use
107:48 - use styles like this okay so that is the
107:56 - the way and material UI that we bring
107:58 - that that in so if you want to know more
108:00 - about that I just check out the
108:02 - documentation for material UI and how we
108:05 - implemented that so I I never really had
108:09 - reason to dig deeper into all the
108:11 - theming options for material UI I just
108:15 - use a little bit of them so I'm not
108:17 - really comfortable explaining even more
108:20 - in-depth as to what's going on behind
108:21 - the scenes but that hopefully I don't
108:24 - point you in the right direction if you
108:25 - want to research it a bit more
108:38 - Hyperion Jupiter says I'm passing out
108:40 - just by looking at his codes why is it
108:45 - is it ugly is my code just so sloppy or
108:48 - what Razvi says try Adonis J s instead
108:56 - of Express j s
108:57 - alright I've never tried Adonis I
108:59 - haven't even read up on anything about
109:01 - it can you
109:02 - Robb's if you're still around could you
109:03 - explain like some of the then maybe the
109:06 - differences between Adonis and Express
109:08 - and like why would we want to use Adonis
109:10 - instead of Express
109:22 - Michael Creole says that Burt Reynolds
109:25 - died so that stinks if you know what
109:30 - Burt Reynolds is was was an actor right
109:34 - so yeah I'm not sure I'm gonna he had to
109:38 - have been pretty old at this point I
109:40 - mean I haven't most of the stuff that he
109:43 - acted in was when I was a lot younger
109:45 - right
109:56 - Oh mayor says your bid off with
109:59 - pronunciation but it's fine is is it my
110:02 - ear let me know I really do want to
110:04 - pronounce it correctly so I don't I
110:09 - don't want to be constantly saying your
110:11 - name wrong
110:23 - lovneet says target container is not a
110:27 - Dom element how do I fix it I'm not sure
110:32 - I mean just off the top of my head I'm
110:36 - not sure about that error so I might
110:38 - need to know a little bit more info to
110:39 - help you with it
110:43 - krishna says this is so interesting
110:45 - awesome I'm glad that glad you find it
110:47 - interesting lebanese says i'm a beginner
110:52 - in react Jas any suggestions I would
110:54 - suggest like just generally try to do a
110:56 - little bit with it everyday that way you
110:58 - won't forget what you've learned and
111:00 - you're just kind of slowly built up and
111:02 - you know don't don't be afraid to just
111:04 - read like the react documentation
111:07 - definitely take advantage of using
111:09 - things like create react app to help you
111:12 - just get started you you don't need to
111:15 - know how to completely set everything up
111:17 - from scratch to be good with reacts you
111:19 - you really don't so don't you know don't
111:23 - don't feel ashamed to you know kind of
111:26 - use those things the same way with like
111:28 - routing you don't need to make your own
111:30 - router use react router or use something
111:33 - like next Jas with a built-in same thing
111:35 - with server-side rendering right you
111:37 - don't have to do it yourself there's so
111:39 - many good tools around that are really
111:42 - like high quality so you could get
111:45 - really overwhelmed and really kind of
111:49 - slow yourself down if you try to go and
111:52 - learn how to do these things from
111:53 - scratch when it's really unnecessary
111:54 - right you take advantage of the tools
111:58 - that have already been built and a lot
112:01 - of testing and work has been put into it
112:12 - but fazil says good days bro i like this
112:16 - channel awesome I'm glad you like it
112:18 - programmer says what are you listening
112:20 - to I'm just listening to Spotify so it's
112:25 - it's just a bunch of different songs
112:26 - it's one of like the daily mix channels
112:28 - so to be honest with you it sounds like
112:32 - I don't know like pop music really I
112:37 - actually try not to put when I'm doing a
112:40 - stream I try not to put music on but
112:42 - like I really like is then it's
112:43 - distracting I don't want to like pay
112:45 - attention to it so it's better to just
112:48 - have some random stuff going but the
112:53 - music in the background helps me number
112:56 - one I can't hear what's going on outside
112:57 - my door so it's not distracting me
112:59 - number two it helps me to make sure that
113:02 - I I talk loud enough for the mic to pick
113:04 - it up you're normally I'm I'm kind of
113:07 - soft-spoken and I have a tendency to
113:11 - mumble sometimes if I'm not really
113:13 - thinking about it so this helps me kind
113:15 - of overcome that so y'all can understand
113:17 - what I'm saying
113:25 - Oh No where the where the subtitles I
113:29 - don't understand he says I'm really
113:31 - sorry so we don't have subtitles for the
113:33 - live stream YouTube does those automatic
113:37 - subtitles so you may be able to catch
113:39 - the recording I mean I don't even know
113:40 - if you can understand what I'm saying
113:41 - now I'm sorry you may be able to catch
113:44 - the recording and have the automatic
113:46 - subtitles work we don't really have
113:48 - anybody that will like do the subtitles
113:51 - manually if anybody's interested in
113:53 - doing any subtitles for for this channel
113:56 - or for any of my videos let me know that
113:59 - would be awesome I'm sure we can we can
114:03 - do that and I definitely give you a
114:05 - shout out like constantly on my stream
114:13 - you V design says this is Carl from
114:15 - Twitter don't really understand
114:18 - everything just digesting everything and
114:21 - so I bring myself up to speed
114:22 - oh yeah cool um feel free to ask ask any
114:25 - questions you know I'll be happy to like
114:28 - stop and go back over what I'm doing so
114:31 - and that goes for anybody you know I if
114:35 - I lose you on something let me know I'll
114:38 - definitely go back and explain I want
114:41 - this these streams to be as helpful as
114:42 - possible to you all let's see this is an
114:50 - interesting character so I need to go do
114:52 - a little little translation here
115:02 - Melo's so me lo says Jessie what college
115:07 - did you go to or high school so the
115:11 - college I mentioned earlier was West
115:13 - Liberty University when I went there was
115:15 - called West Liberty State College but it
115:17 - like upgraded to a university so that's
115:19 - what it's called now and for high school
115:21 - I went to a high school called we're
115:23 - high
115:24 - so we're high school in in the town of
115:27 - Weirton West Virginia so it was it not
115:33 - that big of a high school I think there
115:35 - were around 200 students in my
115:38 - graduating class so anyway that's that
115:45 - was where I went
115:49 - na naman says I'm pursuing a Bachelor in
115:55 - computer science third or final year I
115:57 - have a little bit of knowledge about
115:59 - cc-cold sauce java HTML can you give me
116:03 - advice in what language I should focus
116:04 - on more it entirely depends on what you
116:08 - want to do right also Naaman says and
116:12 - what is trending in the market now okay
116:19 - honestly I feel like I say this a lot so
116:24 - sorry but javascript is just it's really
116:26 - big right now there is so much so like
116:29 - everything on the web is JavaScript
116:31 - right it has been for a while but even
116:34 - more is being built in JavaScript you
116:38 - know with electron thing like desktop
116:40 - apps for Mac Linux and Windows you have
116:45 - Android and iOS apps being built with
116:48 - things like react native and ionic you
116:51 - have now
116:52 - data science stuff being done machine
116:55 - learning stuff being done with things
116:56 - like tensorflow and brain j/s you can
117:00 - you have AR and VR stuff being built
117:04 - with I can't remember what the libraries
117:09 - are but you know there are JavaScript
117:12 - libraries to do almost anything that you
117:15 - could be doing and
117:16 - future science so if you're not sure
117:19 - what you want to do try javascript if
117:23 - you know what you want to do then maybe
117:25 - you want to research okay so from what I
117:27 - understand about things like data
117:29 - science and machine learning Python is
117:32 - the route to go if you're really into
117:34 - just building for Android Java or Kotlin
117:38 - iOS is Swift we're trying to think what
117:43 - else if you really want to go into like
117:50 - content management systems like
117:52 - WordPress or Drupal
117:54 - those are PHP based so it really depends
118:00 - on what you want to do right hopefully
118:02 - that helps if you give me some more info
118:04 - on what you're into maybe I could kind
118:07 - of give you some more targeted advice
118:10 - Meyer says Adonis J s is laravel of
118:14 - JavaScript so I don't know that much
118:17 - about laravel though right it's a is it
118:19 - PHP framework I think it is I it doesn't
118:23 - help me that much okay let's see
118:39 - Wladimir says what is the best books for
118:43 - starting to learn javascript for
118:45 - beginners there's a whole series and you
118:49 - can actually read it for free I believe
118:51 - it's on github it's called you don't
118:53 - know J s great series
118:57 - there's also another book available for
118:59 - free online called eloquent JavaScript
119:03 - those two books I think are awesome and
119:06 - they're great places to start out not
119:09 - only will they teach you Java Script but
119:11 - it'll teach you a lot of like basic
119:12 - computer science concepts MD says how to
119:19 - build a real-world application with
119:20 - react and how many projects do I have to
119:23 - - for my own advanced user that's really
119:26 - a hard question to answer so I mean to
119:30 - build a real-world application I mean if
119:34 - you build an application like that's
119:36 - it's a real-world application right if
119:37 - it does something like that's it now if
119:40 - you're talking about like actually
119:42 - getting paid to build something I mean
119:44 - there you'll need to actually find
119:46 - someone who's willing to pay you to
119:47 - build it but it's hard to say how many
119:50 - projects you'd have to work on right
119:53 - because projects like you know you could
119:56 - do a project it's like a weekend project
119:58 - and it's this little thing right and it
120:00 - does one thing or you can do a project
120:02 - like what we're working on now that
120:04 - we've been working on literally all year
120:07 - right we started I believe in January
120:11 - for this project so it really depends so
120:17 - my advice is just each time you do a
120:20 - project try something new try to push
120:23 - yourself a little bit further and then
120:25 - you at least you'll know you're
120:26 - improving right and you know that's
120:31 - really all you can do right just keep
120:33 - trying to get better
120:41 - okay
120:50 - okay so someone is typing and so I think
120:54 - Melo's is typing in Croatian here is
120:58 - that it says you can find free books in
121:01 - PDF format okay cool so we're talking
121:05 - about Vladimir's asking about the books
121:07 - so I got my Google Translate open the
121:10 - other window so I think he says you can
121:11 - find free books yeah
121:26 - ome lo said Serbian not Russian I'm very
121:29 - sorry I did not mean to to confuse that
121:33 - so you're right I shouldn't assume that
121:41 - also Mila says are apps with with books
121:45 - on the Google Play Store david is react
121:54 - better than angular or is it about the
121:56 - same say truth I haven't used angular
121:58 - since angular 1 so I can't really give
122:01 - you a great answer to that reactant
122:05 - angular are not exactly the same so it
122:10 - could be that angular may be better for
122:12 - some things and react is better for
122:14 - other things the thing that I found
122:18 - really is you can build awesome stuff
122:20 - with anything and you can build terrible
122:23 - stuff with anything it depends on how
122:25 - you use it right and one framework or
122:30 - library is not going to be the answer to
122:31 - every everything right so better to just
122:35 - say look what fits the situation in
122:39 - terms of what resources do I have what
122:41 - are the project requirements you know
122:43 - what how much time do I have and what do
122:46 - I already know right now you know what
122:47 - is my team though so in some cases maybe
122:51 - it's gonna be rad maybe it's gonna be
122:52 - angular maybe it'll be view may be obese
122:55 - like amber who knows I mean who knows
122:57 - what it's just gonna be the hail says I
123:03 - want to become a back-end slash full
123:05 - stack developer so do you think getting
123:07 - a degree in computer science is worth
123:09 - the money and time or just at end of
123:11 - boot camps of self teach here's my my
123:14 - normal advice for this now take it take
123:17 - into consideration this I live in the
123:20 - United States I don't know what the
123:21 - situation is like in other parts of the
123:23 - world in terms of what's required for
123:26 - jobs and how much college costs so
123:30 - here's my advice if you have
123:33 - scholarships that are gonna pay for your
123:35 - education or your parents are gonna pay
123:36 - for it go for it
123:39 - okay it may come in handy at some point
123:42 - and if you're gonna get it for free then
123:45 - take advantage of that right if you have
123:49 - to pay for it and it's gonna cost a lot
123:50 - and you're gonna have to get take out
123:52 - loans and go into a significant amount
123:54 - of debt don't do it you're gonna set
123:58 - yourself back a lot and it's gonna
124:00 - severely restrict your options later on
124:03 - right when when you don't have to pay
124:07 - you know let's say I don't know like six
124:09 - hundred plus dollars a month through
124:11 - your student loan payment then you have
124:14 - a lot more options to say like you know
124:17 - what I'm gonna I'm gonna work on this
124:21 - project even though I'm not going to
124:23 - make that much because it's gonna get me
124:25 - in with this company that could lead to
124:27 - something or I'm gonna be able to work
124:29 - with this technology and it's gonna look
124:30 - really good on my portfolio right you
124:32 - may not be able to say that you may have
124:34 - to say you know what I'm gonna have to
124:35 - take this job because it pays a lot or
124:38 - it pays enough right now working with
124:40 - some old technology you're doing
124:42 - something that's not really gonna
124:43 - advance my career just to pay the bills
124:45 - right so you may think like college is
124:49 - gonna give you an advantage but it may
124:52 - not it may set you back in in terms of
124:55 - what you can do after school to really
124:58 - put yourself in a position to get the
125:00 - job you want right so but like I said it
125:05 - definitely depends on your financial
125:07 - situation and and what's going on and
125:09 - what you want to do right if you want to
125:11 - if you want to get into like you said
125:13 - get a front back-end or a full stack
125:16 - developer you could definitely get a job
125:19 - without the degree but it's not like
125:22 - that for not even for every job in
125:24 - computer science right so definitely do
125:28 - your research and especially like in
125:30 - your area - right I don't know what it's
125:36 - like in other job markets in other
125:38 - countries
125:50 - Rasen says I'm starting my first
125:53 - developer job on September 17th got some
125:57 - advice to give I'll work with react oh
125:58 - yeah cool um congratulations first of
126:02 - all that's awesome
126:04 - definitely if you can come back to his
126:07 - stream after and let me know how it's
126:09 - going let me know your jobs one if you
126:10 - can't come to a stream just like DM me
126:12 - or something on Twitter let me know I'd
126:15 - love to hear how it's going but here's
126:18 - my advice when you first start out a job
126:20 - listen a lot right don't worry about
126:25 - proving yourself right off the bat I
126:27 - know it's a big temptation to try to
126:28 - like I got to prove myself but eh they
126:33 - believed in you enough to hire you right
126:36 - they went through that process that
126:38 - expensive difficult process of finding a
126:41 - new employee and they put their faith in
126:44 - you
126:45 - you don't have to convince them right
126:49 - they've you've already convinced them so
126:52 - don't worry about trying to prove
126:54 - yourself because sometimes you know you
126:56 - could you could end up looking foolish
126:59 - if you're trying too hard to prove
127:00 - yourself right so instead try to listen
127:02 - way more than you talk right because you
127:08 - need you want to figure out what's going
127:09 - on in your organization like not just
127:12 - technically but also like who how do
127:17 - things work in terms of the
127:19 - relationships you know in your company
127:21 - right who's now like it'd be great if
127:25 - everybody was nice and perfect right but
127:27 - we're not so it's like who is
127:28 - trustworthy right who's telling you good
127:30 - information and who's maybe not telling
127:33 - you good information right who can you
127:35 - trust to talk to honestly about things
127:37 - and who should you maybe like watch what
127:39 - you say around right so you want to be
127:42 - able to take all that in and and just
127:46 - kind of sit back and also like you don't
127:49 - want to accidentally offend somebody
127:50 - right if you step in and say why are we
127:52 - doing it like this that's a terrible
127:53 - idea
127:54 - you don't realize like maybe your boss
127:56 - was the one that came up with that idea
127:58 - right that's you know that's a mistake
128:01 - right so
128:03 - sit back right you will have plenty of
128:06 - time to prove yourself when you actually
128:07 - start working on your projects veda but
128:10 - that's my advice at first when you come
128:13 - into a situation like be very friendly
128:15 - be friendly to everybody certainly if
128:18 - somebody talks to you like be friendly
128:19 - and talk but you know in general like
128:22 - sit back and and relax you know I don't
128:25 - think anybody expects you to come in on
128:26 - day one and do amazing things right so
128:31 - just like take your time to get a feel
128:34 - for what's for what's going on there
128:37 - anybody else has any other advice for
128:39 - starting a new do developer position
128:43 - please let browser I know in the in the
128:45 - chat
128:48 - melosa is trying to teach myself and
128:51 - it's not easy okay so that was in
128:53 - response I think to somebody else we'll
128:55 - skip the jbs what kind of tech is
129:00 - typical for a front-end dev javascript
129:03 - HTML CSS that's that's your basics of
129:07 - you know every front-end devs going to
129:09 - know that or at least they should if
129:12 - they don't I'm not sure what like what
129:14 - they'd be working on but yeah your your
129:17 - front-end does and in a call from
129:25 - somebody I don't recognize the number
129:26 - I'm just trying to remember if I had I
129:29 - don't think I'm expecting it cause so I
129:32 - think I'm good yes so that's your basics
129:36 - now if you want to branch out and do
129:38 - other stuff you know so you can get into
129:42 - react are you to talk about testing
129:44 - maybe you're gonna use jest or something
129:46 - like that like you want to interact more
129:52 - with like like REST API is and things so
129:55 - like there's a lot of different routes
129:56 - you can go to start branching out and
129:58 - your knowledge but your basic stuff that
130:00 - you should for sure know HTML CSS
130:03 - JavaScript
130:08 - David says I'm about to lead a software
130:10 - development team for the first time and
130:12 - I'm not an experienced developer myself
130:13 - what should I be concerned about you
130:19 - know what I would say if you're gonna
130:23 - lead a team
130:24 - just make sure now I don't want to give
130:35 - you that advice here but if you're not
130:38 - as experienced as some of the people
130:39 - you're gonna be leading don't be afraid
130:42 - to admit that and be honest about it
130:44 - because it'll probably be obvious at
130:46 - some point to those people right so I'd
130:50 - be open about the fact that you know say
130:53 - hey like I want people on my team that
130:57 - know more than me or different things
130:59 - than me right to fill in those gaps and
131:02 - make it clear that your job in
131:04 - particular is to make sure everybody
131:06 - works together all right it'll be a lot
131:08 - more clear that maybe you don't that
131:13 - it's okay that you're leading people
131:15 - that may be better than you at being a
131:17 - developer right because your number one
131:19 - job is not just the coding your job is
131:22 - to make sure that the whole team works
131:24 - together right so kind of like
131:25 - establishing that right off the bat is
131:28 - good but then balance that too and I
131:31 - know this is gonna be hard to do but try
131:33 - to balance that with yes I'm gonna I
131:35 - really want your opinion on I respect
131:37 - your opinion but at the end of the day
131:39 - like if I'm leading this I'm gonna have
131:41 - to make some calls that may be different
131:44 - than what you suggest so you're just
131:47 - trying to have that balance of you know
131:50 - respect going both ways you know now I
131:56 - how you do that is it's really gonna
131:59 - depend on the personalities of the
132:00 - people that you're working with - it'd
132:02 - be hard to say for sure but hopefully
132:05 - that helps a little bit
132:41 - Mila says Jessie it is a hacker he got
132:44 - your number joke I don't get it I don't
132:48 - know what the joke is I'm missing
132:50 - something and an Arabic says I'm very
133:01 - interested in programming programming
133:03 - I'm 30 years old and if dedicate myself
133:06 - to this will I get hired or accepted by
133:10 - companies or would they be interested in
133:14 - someone who's over 30 years old oh yeah
133:16 - for sure for sure I wouldn't worry about
133:21 - that
133:23 - your there's like AI seems to be a lot
133:32 - of apprehension about like age and the
133:34 - tech industry but if you can prove that
133:36 - you can do the work that's what's most
133:39 - important right so I wouldn't worry
133:43 - about that just focus on being able to
133:45 - do to do the work
134:01 - Vladimir this is he's gonna start it to
134:06 - build a site for survival cut many
134:08 - skills that's cool
134:11 - if you start building that share that
134:14 - that'd be cool I want to check it out
134:19 - and our back says is a Cisco certificate
134:22 - good to get a job well if you want to do
134:24 - Cisco Networking then yeah it's it's
134:27 - good it just depends on what you want to
134:29 - do I I don't really know what the job
134:32 - prospects are for that right now so I
134:33 - can't say whether or not it's it's gonna
134:36 - get you a job for sure or not
134:41 - neither says I'm referring to the
134:43 - unknown number which called you I'm
134:45 - terrible oh okay
134:47 - bye bad haha I totally forgot I was
134:51 - getting a call I shout okay it was my
135:00 - mortgage company so I'm looking to get
135:02 - like a home equity loan to do some
135:05 - remodeling in my house so my wife has
135:08 - wanted to remodel the house for years
135:10 - and so I finally am like okay let's get
135:13 - this he'll be the loan and and we'll do
135:16 - this so anyway it was somebody from the
135:19 - loan company calling me to remind me of
135:22 - all the documents I have to send in
135:30 - let's see I think I'm almost through
135:35 - everything
135:38 - JB says are you using a design framework
135:40 - on the project yes so material UI is
135:44 - what we're using David says thank you
135:47 - for your advice Jesse best of luck to
135:49 - you in the future

136:42 - all right cool so and my throat is gonna
