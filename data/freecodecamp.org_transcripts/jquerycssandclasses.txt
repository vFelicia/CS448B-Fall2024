00:00 - jquery includes some handy ways to get
00:02 - and set css properties of elements and
00:05 - also to get in set classes of elements i
00:07 - already have some html code set up here
00:09 - you can see just a few different
00:10 - elements they have some classes on it i
00:13 - also have some css here just a few
00:15 - things the red class and the big class
00:18 - and then i've already started an action
00:20 - for a button using jquery we have the
00:21 - jquery selector to select the button and
00:24 - then i've added a click event and then
00:26 - i'm just about to put in what happens
00:27 - when you click the event and i'm going
00:29 - to show you how to work with css and
00:31 - classes
00:33 - first if you need help adding jquery to
00:35 - your project you can check out my
00:37 - getting started with jquery video
00:40 - so first i'm going to show you how to
00:42 - get css properties we can use the css
00:45 - method
00:48 - and we're going to get the font size
00:49 - property
00:50 - so i've selected the paragraph now this
00:53 - is just going to give us the font size
00:55 - of the first paragraph element and we
00:57 - want to display that so let's put it in
00:59 - the console
01:00 - console.log
01:03 - so we have the we selected the paragraph
01:05 - dot css and we're going to get the css
01:08 - of font size
01:10 - so i'm going to click here and you can
01:11 - see in the console 16 pixels
01:14 - so this is in camel case but you can
01:16 - also put it how you would normally see
01:18 - in css with a dash here
01:20 - and then if i um click there again it's
01:22 - just going to show the same thing
01:24 - 16 pixels now we can also select the
01:27 - paragraph tag with the big class
01:33 - and 36 pixels because it's bigger
01:36 - now let's take off the console.log
01:38 - because instead of getting the property
01:39 - we're going to set the property we pass
01:42 - in two things the class name font size
01:45 - and what we're going to set it to let's
01:46 - set it to 100 pixels
01:48 - so now big is going to be even bigger
01:51 - click the element oh it's even bigger
01:53 - it's 100 pixels now
01:55 - so you just do css
01:57 - the first thing that you pass in is the
01:59 - css property and the second thing you
02:01 - pass in is what you want to set that
02:03 - property to
02:04 - we can also set multiple css properties
02:06 - at once by passing in an object so let's
02:09 - delete that and i'm going to create an
02:11 - object which is just surrounded by these
02:13 - curly braces and we're going to pass in
02:16 - key value pairs
02:18 - so when we're passing key value pairs
02:20 - you're going to have to use the camel
02:22 - case for the name here whenever you're
02:24 - passing in as a string
02:26 - you can use either way either the dashes
02:28 - or the camel case but if you're passing
02:31 - in in as a property name like this or if
02:33 - you're passing it as a key you're going
02:35 - to have to use camel case so we're going
02:37 - to set this to 50 pixels comma now we're
02:40 - going to change the color
02:43 - to blue
02:44 - and let's just add a background color
02:48 - oh add a comma here
02:50 - now instead of just doing the big class
02:53 - we're going to select all the paragraph
02:54 - elements so let's see what happens here
02:57 - i'm going to click the button
02:59 - and you can see each paragraph element
03:00 - has the blue text and the yellow
03:02 - background and it's bigger now it's not
03:04 - recommended to use the css method as a
03:07 - setter in production ready code because
03:10 - it's generally best practice to keep
03:12 - presentational information out of the
03:14 - javascript code see we're adding actual
03:17 - css to the javascript code and often
03:21 - you'll want to just keep your css in
03:23 - your css file and then just add or
03:26 - remove classes if you want to change the
03:28 - css so i'm just going to comment that
03:31 - button now and then add the same code
03:33 - again and we're going to change what the
03:36 - button does i just want both still in
03:37 - here so if you click on the link for the
03:39 - code in the description of this video
03:41 - you can see both ways of doing it now
03:43 - let's select the h1 element
03:46 - and we're going to do add class that's
03:49 - how you add a class in jquery so we're
03:51 - going to pass in the class name i'm
03:53 - going to class pass in red
03:55 - first let's go back to how it was before
03:57 - okay if i click the click me
03:59 - you can see that h1
04:01 - changed to red because we add the reg
04:03 - class we can also remove classes so here
04:06 - i'm going to select paragraphs and
04:07 - instead of add class i'm going to do
04:09 - remove class and instead of removing
04:12 - class red i'm going to remove class big
04:14 - so i'm going to click the button
04:15 - and you can see the paragraphs aren't
04:17 - big anymore because the big has been
04:19 - removed from every paragraph tag only
04:21 - one of them had the tag to begin with
04:23 - though so another thing you can do is
04:26 - toggle class so let me show you that
04:28 - instead of remove class i'm going to do
04:31 - toggle class and i'm still selecting
04:34 - every paragraph element
04:37 - so now when we click the button it'll
04:39 - just
04:40 - switch see which paragraph is big is
04:43 - switching so it's either turning on the
04:46 - big class if it doesn't already have the
04:48 - big class or it's turning off the big
04:50 - class if it already has it it's toggling
04:52 - the last thing i'm going to show you is
04:53 - how to check if an element has a class
04:56 - we can use the has class method we're
04:58 - going to check if the element h2
05:00 - has the class big
05:03 - and we could put this into an if
05:04 - statement but i'm going to just do
05:06 - console.log
05:11 - okay let's try this
05:13 - false
05:14 - it does not have the class big but if we
05:17 - change this to class
05:19 - red
05:21 - true it does have the class big
05:24 - okay thanks for watching my name is beau
