00:19 - implement a css
00:20 - sponsor framework called foundation now
00:23 - for this tutorial i'm using specifically
00:25 - foundation version 6 made by zurb let's
00:29 - get straight into the crash course i'm
00:31 - gonna go to google or your browser and
00:33 - you're gonna type in
00:34 - foundation
00:36 - dot
00:37 - zerb.com it should bring you to this
00:40 - website if it doesn't look like this
00:42 - might have been outdated so we're gonna
00:44 - go ahead and click download
00:47 - we're gonna download the complete
00:49 - because it just gives us everything
00:52 - click download it should give you a zip
00:54 - file down here now you're gonna go to
00:56 - your desktop and you're going to click
00:58 - you're going to right click
00:59 - go to new
01:00 - folder
01:02 - you're going to name i'm going to name
01:03 - this foundation you can name it whatever
01:05 - you want
01:06 - back to your browser
01:10 - and go to
01:12 - your um your foundation download file
01:15 - click extract all
01:17 - click browse
01:18 - go to desktop click foundation
01:21 - click select folder
01:23 - and then click extract
01:25 - and what that does is basically
01:27 - takes all the files that we just
01:28 - downloaded and put it into our desktop
01:30 - file called foundation and we come down
01:33 - here and we read
01:34 - a little bit about it
01:36 - and how it works and it down here and it
01:38 - shows sites and emails you can also do
01:40 - foundation for emails but for this
01:42 - tutorial we're just going to do sites so
01:44 - we're going to want to do is you're
01:46 - going to go over to getting started then
01:48 - you're going to click
01:49 - sites
01:50 - kitchen sync
01:51 - and you should be in this giant long
01:53 - list called kitchen sink now kitchen
01:56 - sink is every element available in
01:58 - foundation all on one page as you see if
02:01 - you scroll down there's tons of tons of
02:03 - stuff you can put on to it we're going
02:05 - to go through all of it what you're
02:07 - going to want to do now is you're going
02:08 - to want to go down to your editor i'm
02:09 - using adam in this example
02:14 - and you're going to want to click open a
02:16 - project
02:19 - and we're going to select on foundation
02:23 - it should bring us
02:27 - okay so what we get is this
02:29 - large html file
02:32 - pretty long
02:34 - so what we're gonna want to do is we're
02:35 - going to want to
02:37 - delete everything
02:38 - out of the body tags
02:40 - keep the body tags
02:42 - delete everything inside of the body
02:43 - tags
02:44 - except for the javascript
02:50 - and you should be left with
02:55 - this
02:56 - okay so what we want to going to do next
02:59 - is we're going to build some simple form
03:00 - validation
03:02 - inside of foundation
03:04 - now we're gonna just start off with some
03:06 - form tags so we're gonna
03:08 - select that
03:10 - we're gonna write perform just like that
03:14 - we're gonna put some javascript data
03:16 - values in here so we're gonna put data
03:18 - dash
03:19 - abide
03:20 - and no validate
03:23 - we're gonna put a div inside of here
03:24 - we're gonna give it a class called grid
03:28 - x and grid
03:30 - dash margin
03:32 - dash x
03:34 - now inside of that dip we're gonna put
03:36 - another div and we're just gonna give it
03:38 - a class of cell we're gonna make another
03:39 - div we're gonna give it a class called
03:41 - alert
03:43 - blur
03:45 - all out
03:47 - we're gonna give it a style
03:49 - display
03:51 - none
03:53 - we're gonna go back and we're gonna add
03:54 - some javascript values data dash abide
03:59 - dash
04:00 - alert
04:02 - okay so next you're going to make
04:03 - another div
04:05 - and you're going to call it you're going
04:07 - to get a class of grid
04:11 - x
04:12 - and grid
04:14 - margin
04:16 - x and it's the same thing as this one up
04:18 - here it's just how foundation sorts out
04:20 - its uh their divs you're gonna put
04:23 - another div in here
04:24 - you're gonna give it a class called cell
04:27 - small
04:28 - dash 12. what you're going to do next is
04:30 - inside of this div you're going to put a
04:32 - label
04:37 - and you're going to put number
04:41 - number
04:43 - required
04:44 - now you're going to write an input tag
04:48 - and set the type to text or keep it as
04:51 - text and then put a placeholder of one
04:54 - two three four since we are validating
04:56 - numbers and we want the user to know
04:58 - what kind of input to put
05:00 - and then you're gonna put something
05:01 - called area dash describe
05:06 - describe
05:09 - i'm gonna set it equal
05:11 - and inside these are you're gonna put
05:13 - example
05:15 - help
05:17 - text
05:19 - make sure you capitalize the last two in
05:21 - camel case
05:22 - next you're going to put a required
05:24 - pattern so you're going to type in
05:25 - required
05:27 - and then you're going to put a space and
05:28 - then pattern
05:30 - and you're going to set it equal to
05:31 - number
05:33 - and then you can just take out this name
05:35 - and value
05:36 - it's not needed inside of there
05:38 - now next you're going to make a span
05:42 - and you're going to give it a class
05:45 - of form
05:46 - dash air
05:52 - and inside of this you can basically put
05:53 - whatever you want for when the user
05:56 - misspells something or something so you
05:57 - can say
05:58 - yo you've
06:00 - forgot something
06:04 - um
06:13 - like that so when there's an error
06:15 - message it'll just give you this
06:17 - this is basically the error message and
06:20 - after the span make sure you close out
06:22 - the label
06:33 - and after that label you can put
06:35 - paragraph tag
06:37 - and uh give it a class of help text so
06:40 - we're gonna put class
06:41 - help dash
06:43 - text
06:44 - save it and then you're gonna give it an
06:46 - id
06:50 - of example
06:52 - help
06:54 - text to make sure you camel case those
06:56 - and then next you're going to put
06:58 - whatever you want
06:59 - however you want to help the user so i'm
07:01 - gonna put
07:02 - here is
07:03 - how
07:04 - you fill
07:06 - it out
07:09 - and then just save it it's whatever help
07:11 - text you really want to put into it okay
07:13 - so next you're gonna wanna make a div
07:16 - you're going to give it the class the
07:18 - same one as the one up here you can just
07:20 - copy it and paste
07:24 - save it you're going to put a label
07:29 - and you're just gonna put password
07:33 - required
07:38 - and then after that you're gonna put an
07:39 - input
07:42 - and you're gonna put the type as pass
07:45 - word
07:47 - make sure the label is outside
07:50 - on the very end
07:54 - make sure you add an
07:56 - id and set it to password
08:00 - and you can set the placeholder to
08:02 - whatever you want
08:03 - as long as it looks like a password so
08:05 - like um
08:08 - like let's say if this was a password
08:10 - and we're gonna do the same thing we did
08:12 - up here
08:13 - with the
08:15 - area described by so we're just gonna
08:17 - copy this
08:19 - and paste it down here and then we're
08:22 - gonna write after it required and we
08:24 - could take out these name and values
08:26 - because we don't need them
08:27 - and after that we're going to put a span
08:32 - and
08:35 - add a class to it
08:39 - and in that class we're going to call it
08:41 - form
08:42 - air
08:43 - and then we're just going to put i'm
08:46 - required
08:49 - make sure your span and label end after
08:51 - that if you want you can indent them and
08:54 - after the span and label we're going to
08:55 - put a paragraph tag we're going to give
08:57 - it the class as help text
09:05 - and then we're going to give them the id
09:08 - as example
09:10 - help text
09:11 - camel cased
09:12 - inside of this we're going to put enter
09:15 - a
09:15 - password
09:18 - please
09:22 - now if you open it up in your browser
09:24 - the html file
09:26 - you see you get these two uh input
09:28 - fields in here now if you're the type in
09:30 - something other than numbers let's say
09:32 - abc and press enter
09:34 - it's going to say yo you forgot
09:36 - something
09:37 - and if you go to this password area and
09:39 - you just press enter
09:43 - it's going to say i'm required
09:45 - so
09:47 - it basically validates your form to make
09:48 - sure there's an input now these are just
09:50 - placeholders but other than the
09:53 - placeholders it's pretty much empty and
09:56 - you press enter and it says i'm required
09:58 - and if you put letters inside of the
10:00 - numbers
10:01 - it's gonna say you forgot something in
10:03 - your form
10:07 - so that's just some simple form
10:09 - validation for numbers and passwords you
10:11 - can always just change it as you see in
10:13 - the code it's pretty much a pattern
10:15 - up here
10:17 - and we can even add a comment right here
10:21 - um we just say uh about
10:26 - error message
10:31 - ballot
10:39 - right here and this is basically what
10:41 - validates it
10:42 - and then down here
10:47 - is the number
10:49 - valid
10:50 - date
10:53 - and then after that there is the
11:00 - password
11:02 - validate
11:05 - and basically what you can do is you can
11:06 - copy any of these and just change the
11:09 - classes and stuff you can always check
11:11 - the foundation website too it'll also
11:13 - tell you how to change it but these are
11:16 - just some simple form validation for uh
11:18 - foundation
11:20 - okay so up next is the accordion menu or
11:23 - just the accordion and so we're just
11:25 - gonna add a comment down here
11:27 - we're just gonna call it
11:40 - and i'm just gonna tab it down here so
11:43 - basically what we're gonna first do is
11:44 - put it in an unordered list
11:46 - and we're gonna put a class up here
11:48 - we're gonna call it accordion
11:52 - and then
11:54 - we're gonna put a data value called
11:56 - data
11:58 - core in
12:04 - inside of here we're going to put a list
12:06 - item tag and then we're going to give it
12:08 - class name
12:10 - called
12:11 - accordion
12:13 - item
12:14 - is
12:15 - active
12:17 - and then we're just going to give it a
12:18 - javascript value called data
12:22 - accordion item
12:25 - after that we're going to put a link so
12:27 - we're just going to type in a
12:28 - an anchor tag we're going to give it a
12:30 - class
12:33 - and we're going to give it the class
12:34 - called accordion
12:37 - title we're just gonna call this one
12:39 - accordion
12:41 - one
12:42 - and then after that we're gonna put
12:44 - a div
12:45 - we're gonna give this one a class called
12:47 - accordion
12:49 - dash content
12:53 - and then we're going to give it a
12:54 - javascript value called data
12:56 - dash tab dash content
12:59 - and then after this we're going to put a
13:01 - paragraph tag
13:04 - and we're gonna go give it a class
13:10 - next we're gonna put a paragraph tag
13:12 - and we're just gonna say hello
13:15 - world for this one and then we're just
13:17 - gonna put a link and we're just going to
13:20 - put
13:21 - link in it and it's just going to be an
13:23 - empty link
13:25 - now if we go to our website and reload
13:27 - we get this little panel right here but
13:29 - as you see there's only one so we're
13:31 - going to go back into our code and copy
13:33 - and paste it so we get more accordions
13:37 - so see we're back in here and we're
13:38 - going to copy and paste
13:41 - all of this
13:43 - actually we're only going to copy and
13:44 - paste what's inside of the list item
13:48 - we're just going to do it three times
13:51 - and then at the end you're just gonna
13:52 - put the closing tag for the unordered
13:54 - list
13:55 - and then if you go back to your code you
13:57 - see here you can minimize each tab
14:01 - so it's like an accordion and you can
14:03 - open them up by going like this
14:07 - it's pretty cool so we so we're gonna
14:08 - customize it a little bit more so
14:10 - instead of this being panel one
14:12 - we're gonna put panel two we're gonna
14:14 - take out this uh dummy text
14:19 - and we're gonna call this one panel
14:23 - two this one back to panel one
14:25 - this one panel three we're gonna take
14:27 - out all this dummy text
14:34 - and now if we go back to it
14:36 - we reload
14:38 - we get all of these
14:42 - where it's like this and we can
14:45 - customize it even more
14:46 - changing these
14:50 - i'm saving it
14:52 - and then we reload and you see you get
14:54 - it all organized with its content inside
14:57 - of it so accordion one panel one they're
14:59 - just empty links
15:02 - and you can open up each one and it
15:04 - gives you a new panel now up next are
15:07 - something called badges
15:09 - badges are
15:10 - an interesting kind of
15:12 - uh element inside of foundation so i'm
15:14 - just gonna show you what they are
15:17 - so let's just put a comment
15:20 - saying
15:21 - badges
15:27 - and we're gonna make a span tag
15:30 - we're gonna give it a class
15:32 - we're gonna call it primary
15:35 - badge and inside of that we're just
15:37 - gonna put
15:38 - the letter a as capitalized so we can
15:41 - view it
15:42 - and if you go over to your browser and
15:44 - you click reload
15:46 - you see down here
15:51 - down in the bottom left corner of your
15:53 - screen you should see the letter a and
15:56 - tying up inside of a little circle
16:00 - now
16:02 - we can copy this code
16:05 - make another version of it
16:10 - instead of primary we can do something
16:11 - called secondary
16:17 - secondary badge and then we can just put
16:20 - a b go back to the page and reload
16:24 - you get this
16:28 - you get this gray badge down here
16:57 - do
17:17 - now i've added a a div that has a margin
17:20 - bottom of 200 pixels just so you guys
17:21 - can view the badges easily
17:23 - now if we go down here and make another
17:25 - span or copy and paste it instead of
17:28 - primary or secondary we're going to do
17:30 - warning
17:32 - and then we're going to put this one
17:34 - with a c
17:35 - save it go to your web page
17:39 - and click reload and you'll get a yellow
17:41 - one with the letter c inside of it
17:45 - now if you go back to your code make
17:47 - another one there's also another class
17:49 - called
17:50 - alert
17:52 - and alert badge and
17:54 - success badge
17:58 - and if you reload you see you have all
18:00 - different colors of badges and the
18:02 - purpose of a badge
18:04 - is kind of like when something goes
18:05 - successfully or some sort of warning it
18:07 - shows up this badge next to like some
18:10 - words saying your form did not validate
18:13 - and it's
18:14 - has a red badge to it it can signify
18:16 - something about your form or about
18:18 - something you're trying to fill out
18:21 - these are also just great little
18:23 - decorations but if i zoom out
18:25 - to
18:26 - normal you can almost barely see them
18:29 - and i don't know why that is i don't
18:32 - think it's meant for reading i think i
18:34 - think it's meant just for the color and
18:36 - for signifying that something's not
18:38 - correctly filled out so up next we have
18:40 - buttons and we're just going to start
18:42 - off by putting a comment saying buttons
18:46 - or just button
18:50 - we're going to start off by obviously
18:51 - making a button
18:52 - and we're going to keep the type as
18:54 - button but we're going to take away the
18:57 - the name of the button
19:00 - because we don't need the name then
19:01 - we're going to give it a class
19:03 - called button now if you look at your uh
19:06 - website and you reload it you see down
19:08 - here you get an empty blue box that's
19:11 - because you have to put text inside of
19:13 - it so we're just gonna put
19:15 - button
19:16 - and if you go back
19:18 - and reload
19:20 - you see you have a button down here
19:23 - now i'm gonna add that padding back in
19:25 - here
19:35 - just so that we can get so you can see
19:37 - it clearly
19:39 - we reload
19:40 - as you see it's down here now you can
19:42 - give each button a type of class that
19:44 - changes the color or look of the button
19:47 - so for example if we copy this
19:49 - paste it and put
19:53 - a second or um
19:56 - success
19:57 - button
20:02 - and you reload it gives you a blue
20:04 - button
20:05 - if we were to paste it again and say
20:08 - alert
20:10 - button with a space
20:12 - and reload it you would get a red one
20:14 - you can also do the same for uh sizing
20:16 - so you can do
20:18 - tiny
20:19 - button
20:21 - and it gives you a tinier button
20:25 - or you could do
20:30 - a large
20:31 - button
20:33 - will give you even bigger button
20:41 - and you can even do things like expanded
20:43 - button so if we go to the class and put
20:46 - expanded
20:48 - button
20:50 - reload you see it takes up the whole
20:51 - width of the screen you can also have a
20:54 - small button too so it's in between the
20:56 - tiny and large button
20:58 - so if you just put small button and you
21:00 - reload you get this medium sized button
21:03 - and these are basically all the buttons
21:05 - obviously they're not linked to anything
21:07 - because we didn't uh
21:09 - put a hyper reference into here but you
21:11 - can link these two different things such
21:13 - as exists
21:15 - such as a success page or
21:18 - an error page take up the whole bottom
21:20 - of a
21:21 - portfolio object
21:24 - or you can just have different sizing
21:26 - buttons and colors they all have
21:28 - automatic hover and whenever it's like a
21:30 - green button or a black button it'll
21:32 - turn to white text or black text
21:35 - next we're going to do something called
21:36 - call outs now callouts are like little
21:38 - messages that show up on your screen
21:40 - they're not really messages they're more
21:41 - like sections so i'ma show you what they
21:43 - are and how they're useful
21:47 - now we're gonna um
21:49 - just put a comment like always
21:51 - and we're gonna just call this call out
21:54 - and then just indent it here
21:58 - and then we're gonna make a div and
22:00 - we're gonna have the class as call out
22:05 - we're gonna put an h5
22:09 - and we're just gonna say hello
22:11 - world
22:13 - and then we're gonna put a paragraph tag
22:15 - we're just gonna say this is a call out
22:19 - we're gonna save it
22:20 - and you know just for fun we're gonna
22:22 - put a link
22:24 - we're just gonna say link
22:27 - now if we go to our browser you see down
22:30 - here we have a call out it's just a
22:32 - simple little section that we have that
22:34 - says hello world this is a call out and
22:36 - a link which does nothing
22:38 - and
22:39 - but what we can do with it is we can
22:41 - change it so let's copy this
22:48 - and we're going to set um actually
22:51 - just copy the
22:53 - the callout part not the um
22:55 - the margin
22:56 - we're gonna do call out warning
23:01 - and it gives us this yellow call out now
23:03 - we can do this for success and alert too
23:06 - so if we do
23:09 - call out
23:11 - success
23:13 - and
23:14 - call out
23:15 - alert
23:17 - and we reload you get the green one and
23:20 - the red one which are just basically um
23:24 - like
23:25 - like the buttons and the badges success
23:27 - and
23:28 - um warning
23:29 - now there's also a secondary one that
23:32 - shows the gray if we um
23:34 - but call out
23:36 - suck on dairy
23:37 - we save it we reload you get this
23:39 - grayish kind of one
23:42 - now another thing too about this is
23:44 - there's also a primary one where you can
23:45 - set it back to its default called calm
23:48 - call out primary
23:50 - and if you save and you reload you get
23:52 - back to this blue one there's the
23:53 - difference between just call out and
23:55 - call out primary and secondary obviously
23:58 - alert warning and success are completely
24:00 - different but you always have to watch
24:02 - out for these um these class changes
24:06 - so in foundation there's
24:08 - things called close boxes or just
24:10 - closeouts what you can basically do with
24:12 - them is you can add them to callouts for
24:14 - example
24:15 - and you can be able to close out of a
24:17 - call out and wipe it from your screen
24:19 - and i'm going to show you how to do that
24:20 - so what you're going to want to do is
24:21 - you're going to want to add a data value
24:23 - after your class called
24:25 - data
24:27 - dash close
24:30 - level
24:32 - then after that you're going to want to
24:33 - add a button
24:35 - so just type in a button
24:37 - and you can keep the type as button
24:39 - and you can take out the name
24:43 - you're going to add a data value to this
24:45 - called data close
24:49 - we're going to add an area label before
24:51 - the data close so area
24:54 - dash
24:56 - label
24:58 - i'm going to set that equal to
25:02 - you're gonna write close
25:05 - alert
25:08 - and you're gonna give it a class called
25:09 - close button
25:22 - and save the file
25:24 - after this you're going to make a span
25:28 - inside of the first span tag you need to
25:30 - put area
25:31 - dash
25:32 - hidden
25:34 - and you can set it equal to true
25:36 - colon
25:38 - and then save the file now you're going
25:40 - to want to put this span you're going to
25:42 - copy it
25:46 - and then you're going to put it
25:48 - inside of the closed i mean
25:50 - you're going to put it inside of the
25:51 - button
25:54 - and then you're going to save
25:55 - now if you go to your website now if you
25:58 - check your web browser you should see
25:59 - this little x over here and when you
26:02 - click it
26:03 - it just disappears now when you reload
26:06 - the page
26:07 - it obviously comes back because it's not
26:09 - saved into your local data or caches but
26:12 - there's a way you can do that but you
26:14 - can basically exit out of any call out
26:17 - you want just by adding those data
26:18 - variables and the classes now make sure
26:21 - you do wrap the variables into the div
26:24 - so make sure there's one large div
26:25 - around the whole thing like in here i
26:27 - added a div so it would close off the
26:30 - call out make sure you put a div so you
26:32 - close out the call out and the close
26:34 - button
26:35 - and the span and yeah basically that's
26:38 - how you add an exit out button or a
26:41 - a closeout tab on any call out okay so
26:45 - up next we're going to do a drop down
26:46 - pane
26:47 - now drop down pane is basically where
26:49 - you click the button
26:51 - and it shows a little message below it
26:53 - these can be used for many things such
26:55 - as errors with badges or
26:57 - panels you can use this as a little help
26:59 - text so we're gonna i'm gonna show you
27:01 - how to do this
27:03 - so first we're gonna scroll down
27:05 - after all the call outs we're gonna make
27:07 - a comment
27:09 - or tab it in
27:11 - and we're gonna call it drop down
27:14 - pane
27:20 - and save it and then first we're going
27:21 - to put a button
27:24 - we're going to leave the type alone
27:26 - we're just going to take out the name so
27:28 - we don't need it
27:30 - we're going to give it a class called
27:31 - button
27:33 - so class
27:35 - button this just gives primary button
27:37 - standards
27:38 - we're gonna put data
27:40 - dash toggle
27:42 - and set it equal to
27:45 - we're gonna name it to example
27:47 - dash drop down
27:52 - and now inside of this button we're just
27:54 - gonna put
27:55 - um
27:57 - drop
27:58 - actually we're just gonna say toggle
28:02 - drop
28:03 - down
28:05 - and after this button we're going to
28:06 - make a div
28:11 - it's going to have the class drop
28:13 - down
28:14 - dash pane
28:17 - we're going to give it the id
28:18 - of example
28:21 - dash drop down and then we're going to
28:23 - give it data dash drop
28:26 - down and then we're just going to call
28:28 - this one
28:28 - drop down
28:31 - pain
28:33 - and if we go to our website this should
28:35 - be working
28:37 - and down in the bottom right you should
28:38 - see this little button saying toggle
28:40 - drop down
28:41 - if you click it and scroll down you get
28:43 - this little text bubble saying drop down
28:45 - pane
28:46 - now if we center this it works a little
28:48 - easier and if we add padding so we're
28:50 - going to do that just to show for a full
28:51 - example
28:54 - now we're going to give this um
28:57 - now we're going to put this in inside of
28:59 - the larger div so we're going to put div
29:02 - we're going to copy all of this
29:06 - inside of here
29:08 - and we're going to just um we're not
29:10 - going to give this a class we're just
29:11 - going to do inline styling
29:13 - we're going to do um
29:15 - display
29:17 - flex
29:22 - and then we're going to do just if i
29:24 - dash
29:25 - content
29:27 - center
29:29 - and text dash align
29:32 - center
29:36 - and we're just going to add
29:40 - margin
29:42 - 15 pixels
29:44 - if we save this this should give it a
29:45 - nice look to it so as you see it has
29:48 - pretty good but we're going to add some
29:49 - more margin to it so that it centers
29:52 - more up
29:54 - we're just going to say 25
29:57 - and if you reload
29:59 - it looks nicer now if you click it you
30:01 - get this little text below it saying
30:03 - drop down pane
30:05 - now if we want to see the full example
30:07 - we're going to add about
30:09 - 50 and then we're just going to do from
30:11 - margin we're going to do margin bottom
30:13 - that way we get what we want we reload
30:16 - we click
30:18 - it says drop down pane
30:20 - and we've clicked the button again it
30:21 - goes away just like a help text or an
30:24 - error
30:25 - so up next is floating classes and we're
30:27 - going to be floating buttons to left or
30:29 - right so first we're going to add
30:31 - a comment and we're going to just say
30:35 - flow
30:38 - buttons we're going to put floating
30:40 - buttons
30:41 - and then just indent it a little
30:43 - and then what you're going to do first
30:45 - is just put you're going to put button
30:47 - you're going to take out the type
30:51 - and you're gonna actually you can keep
30:52 - the type you're gonna take out the name
30:56 - you're gonna add class
31:00 - as just button
31:03 - then you're gonna put
31:05 - a space and then float dash left
31:09 - and then you're gonna put inside of the
31:10 - button just some text saying float
31:13 - left and if you go to your browser you
31:14 - should have a button floating to the
31:16 - left now as you see down here you have a
31:18 - button floating to the left also you
31:19 - don't always have to use just the normal
31:21 - um
31:22 - primary button you can always go like
31:25 - you can always go
31:27 - uh
31:28 - success button
31:32 - and make it a green button or even a an
31:34 - alert button so alert button
31:38 - left
31:40 - and then you can just copy this
31:45 - and let's say we want this to be a
31:47 - success button
31:50 - and we're just going to make it float to
31:52 - the right
31:54 - we're just going to change the text
31:56 - saying right
31:57 - we go back to our tab
31:59 - reload you have a green button floating
32:01 - on the right
32:02 - and a red button floating on the left
32:05 - and those are basically the floating
32:06 - classes for buttons so up next are
32:09 - labels and
32:11 - labels are basically almost like the
32:13 - badges but you can actually put a word
32:15 - inside of them and be able to read the
32:17 - word so i'm gonna show you what that is
32:19 - so we're gonna make a comment and we're
32:21 - just gonna put
32:23 - labels
32:26 - and then indent so what you're going to
32:28 - first want to do is you're going to put
32:29 - a span you're going to give it a class
32:31 - called
32:32 - primary
32:35 - label
32:36 - and then inside of that you're going to
32:37 - put primary
32:42 - label
32:44 - and then you save it if you go to your
32:46 - browser
32:47 - as you see at the bottom you see this
32:48 - little blue thing called primary label
32:51 - now if we go back
32:54 - and we copy it and you can put things
32:56 - like
32:57 - success
33:00 - and just keep pasting it you can do um
33:03 - you copy it and you can paste it you can
33:05 - put
33:06 - um
33:07 - warning
33:11 - you could put
33:12 - alert
33:15 - and you can even do um secondary
33:20 - if you save it and go view it in your
33:21 - browser
33:23 - you see in the bottom left you have all
33:25 - these labels right here and they're not
33:26 - buttons so you can't really click on
33:28 - them and expect to go somewhere the more
33:30 - like the badges where they're just there
33:31 - to show you like a message of some sort
33:33 - but like a very small message
33:35 - such as success or virus or hello
33:39 - so they're they're kind of useful but
33:41 - sometimes they're not so up next we're
33:43 - doing off campuses now off campuses are
33:46 - those things you
33:47 - kind of see when you're on mobile
33:49 - devices so for example you're trying to
33:51 - look at the menu but you're on your
33:52 - phone you usually have it off canvas
33:55 - appear and it's the three little lines
33:56 - that you click on opens up a side canvas
33:59 - or an off canvas
34:00 - and also referred to as off menus or
34:04 - side menus we're going to learn how to
34:05 - make one of those in foundation first
34:07 - you're going to start off with div tags
34:08 - obviously you're going to give it a
34:10 - class called off
34:11 - dash canvas
34:13 - dash
34:14 - wrapper
34:16 - and you're going to give it another div
34:17 - and the class is going to be off canvas
34:22 - enter
34:24 - off canvas
34:25 - wrapper
34:26 - dash inner you're going to save that i'm
34:30 - going to give it the data type
34:32 - data
34:34 - off
34:38 - wrapper
34:39 - after this you're going to put another
34:40 - div and you're going to give this one a
34:42 - class name of off dash can
34:45 - s
34:46 - position
34:51 - dash left
34:52 - you're going to add an id
34:54 - called off
34:56 - canvas
34:58 - left and then you're going to add data
35:01 - off dash off dash
35:04 - and this
35:06 - and then after all that we're going to
35:07 - leave those divs empty for now after
35:09 - that
35:10 - they're going to add a button
35:13 - you're going to take out the name
35:15 - like we usually do
35:17 - i'm gonna give it a class
35:22 - we're just gonna
35:23 - put it as the button class or the
35:25 - primary button
35:26 - we're gonna add
35:28 - data
35:30 - toggle we're going to set it equal to
35:33 - off
35:34 - can this
35:36 - left and then we're just going to put in
35:38 - here
35:40 - open or we're just going to put uh off
35:43 - canvas
35:45 - forgot to add the comment so we're just
35:47 - gonna add that really quick or just say
35:49 - off
35:50 - cam
35:52 - this
35:54 - save it now if you go to your browser
35:56 - you should see this button down here and
35:57 - when you click it it gives you this off
35:59 - canvas kind of look but it has no
36:01 - content inside of that so we're going to
36:02 - add that really quick so over here in
36:05 - these inner divs all the way into the
36:06 - middle we're just going to put an h2 tag
36:10 - and we're just say hello
36:12 - world
36:15 - and then we're just gonna put an h4 just
36:18 - saying
36:18 - docs or we're just put html
36:24 - and then another h4 saying css
36:35 - um just another one
36:37 - called java script and save that
36:43 - reload and we click off canvas and gives
36:45 - us this little side menu we could bank
36:47 - we can make these links too just by
36:52 - adding opening and closing tags to the
36:54 - very ends copying and pasting them
37:08 - adding placeholders as hashtags
37:14 - save it
37:15 - and you reload
37:17 - and now they're links and you click on
37:18 - them and it just brings you back to the
37:21 - top of the page
37:23 - open it and this is just these are just
37:27 - links and this is an off campus menu but
37:29 - when you minimize it if we inspect and
37:32 - we go to
37:34 - mobile let's just go to a google pixel
37:36 - 2.
37:37 - when we click
37:38 - off canvas it looks like one of those
37:41 - menus that you would have for a phone
37:43 - so and this works on any phone we can go
37:45 - all the way down to an uh
37:47 - an iphone 5se and it still works which
37:50 - are usually the smaller phones so it's
37:52 - good to know that these still work on
37:54 - all devices so up next is pagnation now
37:58 - pagnation is like a type of navigation
38:00 - that hangs out at the bottom and you can
38:02 - go through multiple pages
38:04 - usually at the bottom of product pages
38:06 - or blog pages you can go through
38:08 - multiple pages without having to
38:09 - navigate through the top navigation bar
38:12 - i'm going to show you how to do that
38:13 - down here we're just going to make a
38:15 - another comment as usual just so we can
38:18 - divide up our code
38:25 - we're just going to say pagnation bar
38:28 - indented a little
38:30 - and then we're gonna start off with an
38:32 - unordered list give it a class
38:35 - of
38:36 - tag and nation we're gonna give it a
38:39 - roll
38:40 - and set it equal to navigation and then
38:43 - we're gonna put area
38:46 - and then
38:47 - set it equal to
38:48 - pagination with the capital p inside of
38:51 - this we're going to put in list item
38:54 - we're going to give it a class
38:56 - called disable
38:59 - inside of this we're going to put
39:00 - previous and inside of this
39:03 - uh list item we're going to put a span
39:05 - tag
39:13 - we're gonna give it a class
39:15 - called show dash
39:18 - four dash sr and then we're just gonna
39:20 - put page in between this span tag and we
39:23 - could just close off the ends like that
39:25 - and then after this you're gonna you're
39:27 - gonna copy this
39:30 - and paste it below you're gonna change
39:32 - the class name to current
39:37 - actually you're not gonna put any you're
39:39 - not gonna put anything between those so
39:40 - you're gonna take out the previous
39:42 - you're gonna just put you are
39:45 - on or on
39:47 - page and then in between the span and
39:49 - the list item you're just gonna put one
39:51 - after that you're gonna put another list
39:52 - item list item
39:54 - you're just gonna put a list item a link
39:55 - inside of this
39:57 - you're going to set it to just the
39:59 - hashtag as the placeholder you put area
40:01 - label
40:05 - and set it equal to page
40:07 - two in between you're gonna just put a
40:09 - two between the anchor tag and then
40:11 - you're just gonna copy and paste this
40:15 - and you're just gonna change the numbers
40:16 - from two to three
40:18 - to four
40:20 - and you can just take out this last one
40:21 - we only need to go to
40:22 - four you can change this to
40:25 - three
40:27 - four so next you're gonna add a list
40:29 - item you're gonna give it a class of
40:31 - ellipse
40:37 - and you're gonna do it area
40:40 - hidden
40:42 - equal
40:44 - you're gonna just do true
40:46 - and you're just gonna leave this as that
40:49 - and you're gonna copy just two of these
40:52 - and then you just put in for now we'll
40:54 - just put uh
40:56 - pages 12
40:57 - and
40:58 - 13.
40:59 - we're going to change this for that
41:04 - after that you're going to copy this
41:07 - this item right here
41:09 - you're going to paste it you're going to
41:11 - set the area labeled to capital next
41:13 - space page make sure the page is not
41:17 - capitalized and then after that instead
41:18 - of 13 you're just gonna put next and
41:20 - then you're gonna copy this uh span
41:22 - right here
41:25 - you're gonna paste it after next
41:29 - instead of uh putting you are on page
41:32 - you're just gonna put page if you reload
41:34 - your web page you should get this down
41:36 - here that looks like a little navigation
41:39 - that you would have for a website as you
41:41 - see the disabled class works perfectly
41:43 - with previous and then you can go on to
41:45 - next pages and stuff except for we only
41:47 - have one page so it's not going to go
41:48 - anywhere but uh we're going to style it
41:51 - stylize this a little bit more so
41:53 - you go to your um unordered list we're
41:56 - going to add a style tag we're going to
41:58 - say display
42:01 - flex
42:03 - and then we're gonna put justify
42:06 - content
42:08 - and then we're gonna set it to center
42:12 - and if we go back to our web browser
42:15 - we reload it it should be in the middle
42:17 - just like most web pages would look like
42:19 - now flexbox does work pretty well with
42:22 - uh foundation i haven't found any errors
42:24 - with it
42:25 - as you can see i easily centered that
42:27 - div or that um unordered list into the
42:29 - middle with no problem so foundation
42:31 - does work pretty well with uh flexbox
42:35 - and this is uh what a pagnation looks
42:36 - like on a web browser and that's how you
42:39 - make it in foundation so up next is
42:41 - progress bars now um
42:43 - just a disclaimer in my opinion bulma's
42:46 - uh
42:47 - progress bars are much better than
42:49 - foundations but we're still gonna learn
42:51 - them anyway just to see the difference
42:53 - between the two so let's just go ahead
42:55 - and make them um you're gonna go down
42:57 - here just make a comment
43:00 - uh progress
43:08 - and then down here you're gonna make a
43:09 - div
43:10 - you're gonna give it a class of primary
43:13 - progress
43:16 - save that and you're going to go inside
43:19 - so inside of this div you're going to
43:20 - make another dip and you're going to put
43:21 - the class name at progress
43:25 - meter
43:26 - and then style
43:28 - with
43:30 - 25
43:32 - inside of this you're going to put
43:36 - paragraph tag
43:38 - you're going to put 25 percent you're
43:40 - gonna give this paragraph tag a class
43:42 - it's gonna be progress
43:45 - dash meter
43:47 - dash text
43:48 - and this is gonna be all there is to
43:50 - your progress bar now if you check your
43:52 - browser now if you check your browser
43:54 - you see you have this progress bar in
43:56 - here
43:56 - and
43:57 - you can customize it even more with the
43:59 - warning and success labels as here
44:02 - all we have to do is copy it
44:07 - and we just put a warning
44:10 - progress when we reload it we have a
44:12 - yellow one
44:13 - we do this the same for
44:16 - alert
44:19 - and we could do this the same for
44:22 - success
44:24 - and if we reload you have all these
44:26 - different colors there is not a
44:28 - secondary one because the background's
44:29 - already gray so it'd be kind of useless
44:32 - you wouldn't be able to tell the
44:33 - difference between the progress so they
44:35 - just decided not to have a secondary one
44:38 - now the ways you change the the progress
44:40 - on the bars is you go up to this width
44:42 - styling and you just change it to
44:44 - whatever percent you want and then down
44:46 - here in the paragraph you want to change
44:48 - it to match that so this primary
44:49 - progress should now be at 50
44:52 - change any of these so we change this to
44:56 - 65
45:00 - change this one to
45:02 - 3 percent
45:06 - and yeah basically if we reload you have
45:09 - all different types of widths and stuff
45:11 - and different colors for different types
45:13 - of labeling
45:15 - and yeah that's basically it for
45:16 - progress bars
45:17 - so um next are switches now switches are
45:20 - kind of pointless without a back end but
45:22 - i'm still going to show you the front
45:23 - end and how they're used in foundation
45:28 - so first we're going to make a comment
45:30 - right as always
45:33 - my foundation
45:35 - uh switch
45:38 - and then we're gonna save that we're
45:40 - gonna make a div we're gonna give this a
45:42 - class called tiny
45:44 - switch
45:46 - we're gonna put an input we're gonna
45:48 - give this a class of
45:51 - switch
45:53 - dash input and save it we're gonna give
45:56 - it an id
45:57 - of
45:58 - tiny switch
46:01 - and then we're going to change the type
46:03 - from text
46:05 - to check
46:07 - box and we're going to change the name
46:08 - to
46:09 - example
46:11 - switch
46:12 - and we can take out the value as well
46:15 - now after that we're gonna put a label
46:16 - we're gonna add a class to it and this
46:18 - one's gonna be called switch
46:20 - dash
46:22 - paddle
46:23 - let's save that and then we're gonna put
46:25 - four
46:26 - small switch
46:28 - we're gonna put a span inside of the
46:30 - label
46:33 - we're gonna give it a class
46:35 - it's gonna be show dash
46:38 - four dash sr and inside of this we're
46:41 - going to put small
46:42 - porsche
46:44 - only
46:45 - we're going to capitalize each of these
46:47 - and this should basically give you a
46:50 - switch now if you go ahead and check
46:51 - your browser
46:53 - so in your browser you're going to see
46:54 - this little switch down here and it
46:56 - this is all it does
46:58 - kind of uh misleading but it still looks
47:01 - cool to play with click it a million
47:03 - times if you'd like
47:04 - with some back end i guess it'd be kind
47:06 - of cool you can fill it out as a form
47:08 - so like yes no yes no
47:12 - now you can also add different classes
47:14 - so that you can make them bigger or
47:15 - smaller
47:16 - so we're basically going to copy this
47:21 - we're going to paste it down here we're
47:23 - going to change every tiny
47:25 - too small so we're just going to go
47:27 - ahead and
47:30 - take every tiny
47:33 - we're going to go
47:34 - small
47:36 - and then save it and if you reload you
47:38 - have another one that's slightly bigger
47:40 - than the first one and we do the same
47:42 - thing and make it bigger we're just
47:43 - going to copy this
47:47 - and we're going to find everywhere where
47:48 - it says small
47:52 - and the way i'm doing this is i'm
47:53 - holding ctrl while i'm clicking
47:57 - and you're just going to backspace and
48:00 - put
48:00 - large
48:05 - and you're going to save that you're
48:06 - going to reload and you're going to have
48:07 - a very large button
48:09 - or switch
48:11 - and this is basically how switches work
48:13 - in foundation up next we're going to
48:15 - make tables now tables look a little
48:17 - different in
48:18 - uh foundation and i'll you'll see why in
48:21 - a minute but uh we're just gonna go
48:22 - ahead and start making that now so
48:25 - obviously
48:26 - you know the drill we're just gonna make
48:28 - some
48:30 - comment
48:32 - so we can keep organized
48:38 - and
48:39 - then and then you're gonna put a table
48:41 - tag
48:43 - just like that
48:44 - and then t head or table head and then
48:48 - we're going to make a table row
48:50 - now we're going to make a table header
48:51 - we're going to give it a width
48:55 - of 200.
48:57 - we're just going to name this table
48:59 - header and then we're going to do
49:01 - another table header we're just gonna
49:03 - add no width to this and just say
49:05 - table
49:07 - header now we're gonna copy and paste
49:09 - this one
49:11 - twice
49:13 - we're gonna change this one to 150 we're
49:16 - going to change
49:18 - this one the 150 as well
49:21 - now after the table head we're going to
49:22 - make a table body
49:25 - and then we're going to make a table row
49:26 - and then table data
49:28 - and inside of this data we're gonna put
49:30 - just some text some filler text so we're
49:32 - just gonna say content
49:35 - goes here
49:38 - and next one we're just gonna do table
49:40 - data
49:41 - lorem ispium and we're just gonna
49:44 - minimize this down a little bit
49:51 - so it's not too long and then we can
49:52 - just copy this one
49:56 - and paste it twice over there and after
49:58 - that we're gonna copy this
50:01 - and paste it three more times
50:04 - or two more times as you see we have a
50:06 - perfectly made table over here you see
50:09 - the first row goes gray or a light gray
50:12 - the second one goes full white and then
50:14 - it's a pattern after that
50:16 - and basically what we did is we made one
50:18 - with a certain amount of width and
50:20 - basically organizes it like in a css
50:23 - grid so that it goes one
50:25 - large and then two small ones and this
50:28 - is basically how a table works in
50:30 - foundation
50:31 - so up next is the title bar now the
50:33 - title bar is very responsive navigation
50:36 - usually used on mobile and web apps
50:40 - or mobile websites when you're designing
50:42 - for mobile first they usually have the
50:44 - little cutout on the side where the
50:46 - breadcrumbs that you can easily navigate
50:48 - through and they're very responsive so
50:50 - i'm gonna show you how to make one in
50:51 - foundation
50:53 - so just going to make comment title
50:56 - bar
50:58 - like that
51:01 - indent and then you're going to give it
51:03 - a class called title dash bar
51:08 - inside of there you're gonna make
51:09 - another div and it's gonna be called
51:11 - title dash r gosh left because we're
51:15 - gonna make it to the left we're gonna
51:16 - put a button we're gonna leave the type
51:18 - as button but we can take out the name
51:22 - we're gonna give it a class
51:26 - we're gonna call this menu
51:31 - icon we're gonna put a span after this
51:36 - this is going to have a class called
51:38 - title dash bar
51:40 - left inside of here we're just going to
51:42 - put foundation and then
51:44 - after that div inside of the title bar
51:47 - div but not inside of the title bar left
51:49 - we're gonna make another div we're gonna
51:51 - call this one title
51:53 - dash bar
51:54 - dash right
51:56 - we're gonna put a button
51:58 - we're gonna take out the name
52:02 - we're gonna put a class in here we
52:04 - called menu
52:06 - i put a dash in between and this should
52:08 - give you your little title bar and if
52:09 - you check your browser should have this
52:11 - little title bar now you want to uh
52:14 - obviously put at the top of your web
52:15 - page so it looks like a title now i
52:17 - added some margins so it looks like it's
52:18 - at the top of the page it's really not
52:20 - it's just
52:22 - uh it's just some margin but it looks
52:24 - like it's at the top of a page and this
52:26 - is basically what it looks like the
52:27 - pages don't do anything but you can
52:29 - actually connect the off canvas to those
52:32 - um those
52:34 - to the menu icons and they can open up
52:37 - side menus especially if you're on
52:38 - mobile that can be useful and this is
52:40 - all responsive if i were to go like this
52:44 - it's all responsive there's not much to
52:46 - respond about but
52:48 - it it's still responsive if you have
52:50 - actual navigations inside of this black
52:53 - bar right here
52:54 - it becomes responsive
52:56 - and yeah that's basically how you make a
52:58 - navigation slash title bar in foundation
53:00 - so up next is a tool tip and a tool tip
53:03 - is like um you'll see them in wikipedia
53:05 - a lot and it kind of gives you a general
53:08 - definition of a word that the user might
53:10 - not quite understand right away so i'm
53:13 - gonna show you how to do that
53:15 - now we're just gonna make a comment
53:17 - we're gonna call this tool
53:20 - tip
53:22 - and we're gonna make a paragraph tag
53:24 - because it is a sentence and we're just
53:26 - gonna put the
53:28 - and we're going to space it but we're
53:30 - going to take out that space now inside
53:31 - of this paragraph tag we're going to put
53:33 - a span
53:36 - now the span is going to have a data
53:37 - type called data
53:40 - dash tool tip and then it's going to
53:43 - have area
53:44 - that has pop up we're going to set that
53:47 - equal to true we're going to set a class
53:51 - to has dash tip now we're going to say
53:54 - data dash
53:56 - disable dash hover we're going to set
53:59 - that equal to
54:01 - false and then we're going to put tab
54:03 - index
54:04 - and we're going to set tab index equal
54:06 - to 1 and then we're going to put title
54:09 - fantasy
54:10 - word
54:12 - for a
54:13 - beetle
54:17 - and then this is just another word for a
54:19 - beetle i just copied and pasted it and
54:21 - then this is just some filler text i
54:23 - found well we're just going to do laura
54:25 - mistbium we're going to save that and if
54:27 - you go into your browser
54:29 - and you reload you see down here you get
54:31 - the sentence and oops make sure you put
54:33 - a space after the
54:36 - title
54:39 - not a space uh after the uh
54:41 - the definition word and if you reload
54:44 - you get this and when you hover over it
54:46 - says fancy word for a beetle and it's
54:48 - just a basic definition of what it is
54:50 - you'll see these a lot on wikipedia you
54:52 - can add these to your docs on your
54:53 - website or whatever and that's how it
54:55 - works in foundation so up next is
54:57 - something called html templates and
55:00 - foundation foundation has their own set
55:02 - of templates they have a total of eight
55:05 - if you go to foundation.zurb.com
55:08 - templates.html you'll find these html
55:10 - templates now there's a total of eight
55:12 - and you can download any of them or you
55:14 - can just watch the demo they have news
55:17 - magazines real estate e-commerce blogs
55:20 - portfolios and product pages and a few
55:22 - more these are very helpful if you're
55:23 - just trying to create a portfolio for
55:25 - your business or for getting a job and
55:27 - you don't have too much experience and
55:29 - you just need something to get out there
55:30 - with today we're just going to do the
55:32 - portfolio so you're going to click see
55:34 - demo and as you see this is what the
55:36 - portfolio looks like or the template and
55:38 - if we right click and click view page
55:41 - source
55:42 - there's all this code right here we're
55:44 - going to click control a
55:46 - control c
55:47 - so basically what we're going to do is
55:49 - we're going to click control a
55:51 - and control v
55:53 - and you're going to save it now the
55:54 - first thing you're going to notice is
55:56 - everything is in one straight line and
55:59 - nothing is organized like we are
56:00 - organizing it earlier and that's okay
56:03 - you just need an atom package or a
56:05 - package to go along with your code
56:06 - there's gonna be a link in the
56:07 - description it's an atom package called
56:09 - atom beautify and this organizes your
56:11 - code just like we were doing with all
56:13 - the indentations and white space now uh
56:16 - you can install this package just by
56:18 - clicking install and open with atom and
56:21 - it should install like that
56:23 - if not you can uh install using npm um
56:26 - or the apm command line and just install
56:30 - it that way
56:31 - but it's so much easier if you just
56:32 - clicked install here but once you've
56:35 - installed this you should be able to go
56:36 - to your code and click packages adam
56:39 - beautify and then click beautify
56:42 - what this does is it organizes all the
56:44 - code automatically
56:45 - with all of its indentations and stuff
56:48 - now if you go to your file folder and
56:50 - you click your text or your document you
56:53 - should find this as your document not
56:55 - the link anymore
56:57 - and here's where we will reload and edit
57:00 - our website
57:02 - so we can just minimize out of this
57:04 - minimize out of that
57:06 - and the first things we can change is
57:08 - the title we're going to change this to
57:10 - portfolio
57:12 - so
57:13 - portfolio save we can leave all these
57:16 - links alone
57:24 - we can leave all these script tags alone
57:28 - as you see it it just does its own
57:30 - functionality
57:32 - and you see
57:34 - off canvas position left reveal for
57:36 - large this is what the off campus looks
57:38 - like
57:39 - in this website but there's not a button
57:41 - to open it so it's just always open
57:44 - so we're going to edit this uh off
57:45 - canvas first the height is a hundred
57:47 - percent
57:49 - then down here we're just going to
57:50 - change this to
57:52 - liam
57:53 - stockton
57:55 - save that and then this is a little bio
57:57 - it looks like right
58:00 - yeah it's a little bio
58:01 - so i'm gonna copy and paste the bio from
58:04 - my portfolio so this is my portfolio and
58:06 - we're just gonna go to about
58:08 - and i'm gonna just copy this
58:12 - and then i don't need that anymore then
58:14 - we're gonna go down here i'm gonna paste
58:16 - it into this paragraph tag
58:18 - and then if we save it
58:20 - reload i have my own about down here
58:23 - now you can obviously write your own and
58:24 - you probably should
58:26 - and just change the span below to you
58:29 - know
58:30 - stockton save that
58:35 - then down here there's a call out
58:38 - call out primary what this call out is
58:40 - is this thing up here
58:42 - and they set the width so that it takes
58:44 - up the entire
58:46 - um
58:47 - heading basically and so we're going to
58:49 - change this
58:52 - we're going to just change this to
58:54 - x and
59:01 - expand your creativity
59:03 - and it's just going to have some words
59:04 - down here
59:06 - we're just going to change this text to
59:08 - something whatever you really want it's
59:09 - going to come up here so you just can
59:12 - kind of choose what you want to say up
59:14 - here
59:15 - i'm going to just write some stuff so i
59:17 - wrote this just a little phrase right
59:19 - here and if we go ahead and reload you
59:21 - see we get this over here
59:23 - and now we need to move on to the
59:25 - pictures so i pulled an image from my um
59:29 - my personal images and i'ma just paste
59:31 - it into here
59:34 - and we're gonna rename this
59:36 - to
59:37 - me
59:38 - and it's a jpeg file
59:40 - so down in or we're gonna go back up to
59:43 - the image
59:44 - instead of this right here we're just
59:46 - going to do me dot jpg
59:49 - if we reload
59:50 - there's a picture of me up here now
59:53 - now if um as far as these projects go we
59:57 - need to find images for them
59:59 - so over here are basically projects now
60:02 - of course you're not going to have like
60:04 - 12 projects as it's shown here
60:07 - but uh you're going to at least have at
60:09 - least three or four good ones so we're
60:11 - going to take out some of these
60:14 - so if we go down here we're gonna look
60:16 - for it
60:18 - there's all these cells so we can take
60:20 - out the first one two three four
60:23 - five
60:24 - six
60:25 - we'll just take out the first six and
60:28 - save it and we could take out two more
60:29 - because it kind of looks weird actually
60:31 - no
60:32 - we're just gonna uh copy and paste these
60:34 - two
60:36 - paste them back because we need them
60:38 - if we reload you should have only eight
60:41 - and what we're gonna do is we're gonna
60:42 - fill in these projects
60:46 - so we're just gonna put um
60:51 - uh
60:52 - we're just gonna put port
60:53 - folio as a project
60:56 - and then
60:59 - we're gonna make it a link
61:12 - the portfolio is one project
61:15 - we're going to make this one
61:17 - javascript
61:19 - book
61:20 - marker
61:21 - that's another project
61:24 - and we just replace this pasting
61:27 - and we're going to put this one as let's
61:29 - just say
61:31 - personal
61:32 - website
61:36 - or we're going to do a personal
61:39 - blog and we're gonna save that as a
61:41 - website
61:43 - and these are just different projects
61:45 - that i'm filling in as obviously you can
61:47 - come up with your own projects these are
61:48 - just things that i've done
61:56 - javascript
61:58 - um
62:06 - javascript calculator
62:09 - and we're just going to put one here
62:11 - we're just going to put
62:13 - python
62:15 - e logger
62:18 - we need three more
62:20 - word
62:22 - press
62:25 - plug
62:26 - ends
62:30 - actually we need to make this a link so
62:32 - we're gonna do
62:34 - word press
62:38 - plugins
62:41 - down here we're just gonna put uh
62:47 - react
62:49 - js
62:51 - projects
62:53 - and down here we're just going to do u
62:55 - dot js
62:56 - projects
62:58 - if we reload you see we have oops this
63:02 - one is not a link make sure you make
63:04 - them all links
63:05 - because you want to link to your uh
63:07 - project obviously
63:09 - so we're just going to do
63:11 - this
63:12 - reload and you see they're all links
63:14 - they don't go anywhere you can put your
63:16 - own links so i'm gonna just link these
63:18 - so i've linked some of my uh personal
63:20 - projects in here so if we click
63:21 - portfolio you get to my portfolio
63:24 - click javascript bookmarker you get to
63:26 - all my projects
63:27 - now what we need to do is add pictures
63:30 - or thumbnails so that they want to click
63:32 - on them
63:33 - so this is where we go to google
63:36 - images
63:38 - we need to search for port
63:41 - folio
63:43 - we need it
63:44 - um
63:45 - so we're just search for portfolio
63:48 - and then
63:49 - in tools we're gonna click size
63:52 - and then exactly
63:54 - 550
63:55 - by 550
63:57 - because that's what's over in here
63:59 - and it even tells you the pixel size so
64:02 - i found this image it's not really an
64:03 - image of a portfolio but it's going to
64:05 - work for now since it's just a stock
64:07 - image so we're going to right click and
64:09 - click um copy image address and then
64:12 - we're gonna put it in for each of these
64:16 - placehold dot it pictures
64:18 - you're just gonna paste it in
64:21 - and you can even do the control version
64:24 - and just
64:27 - paste it in like that
64:29 - you do it however you want it's just how
64:31 - you paste it in and replace the
64:33 - the thumbnail pictures with this link
64:35 - that we have if we go over and we reload
64:37 - you see we have a bunch of phones and
64:40 - this doesn't look very nice so we're
64:42 - gonna um
64:44 - add some variety to it
64:48 - so we're just gonna keep finding random
64:49 - images and we're just gonna keep copying
64:52 - the image address and replacing them
64:54 - with different
64:55 - uh thumbnails
64:57 - all images will be in the link in the
64:59 - description
65:02 - i'm just finding random images and
65:05 - clicking copy image address and just
65:08 - pasting them in
65:09 - that way it doesn't all look the same we
65:11 - can get some variety to our portfolio
65:16 - as you see if i reload
65:18 - okay so once you're done copying all
65:20 - these images and finding them
65:23 - you should have a variety like this
65:25 - now um if you want to find these images
65:27 - you can find them in the description i
65:29 - found most of them from just google
65:31 - images so it's not that hard to find
65:34 - but do remember that you have to cite
65:36 - and credit each of these authors they're
65:38 - not you can't just take these images you
65:40 - can always put it down in your footer
65:42 - somewhere
65:43 - but uh just make sure you credit these
65:45 - uh people
65:47 - who took the pictures or made the
65:48 - pictures just so you don't get
65:50 - copyrighted claimed or even sued okay so
65:52 - after this you're going to look at this
65:54 - contact me and you're going to want to
65:56 - change uh the text obviously because
65:59 - it's just dummy text we're going to go
66:01 - ahead and change the text so it says
66:04 - contact me and we're going to change out
66:06 - this text
66:07 - so we're just going to say contact me

66:48 - we're not gonna use dribble we're just
66:50 - gonna do youtube
66:54 - instagram
67:00 - and we're gonna do twitter
67:03 - i'm gonna just paste in these links
67:06 - and instagram
67:08 - save that and we go back and we reload
67:10 - you see we have each of these and if you
67:12 - click on them
67:13 - they lead to your social media in this
67:15 - case my youtube channel
67:18 - this form does not work um
67:20 - obviously you need to set up some back
67:22 - end there is a way you can plug in
67:23 - mailchimp into foundations um
67:27 - into foundations uh back in but and for
67:29 - this tutorial we're just doing front end
67:31 - so we're not going to do that but we're
67:32 - going to go ahead and look at the form
67:34 - and you can change the uh
67:36 - placeholder so it says um
67:40 - type
67:41 - here
67:42 - or we can just say message
67:44 - here
67:48 - and if we go back and reload instead of
67:49 - ola designer it's going to say message
67:51 - here
67:53 - now we have a simple portfolio made in
67:55 - foundation right here and it looks
67:58 - pretty good it's pretty good for a
67:59 - starter portfolio even if you don't have
68:01 - much experience with foundation or with
68:03 - any of these
68:04 - you still can make a pretty good
68:06 - portfolio using an html template and
68:08 - foundation you're probably wondering
68:11 - great i can build a website with a
68:13 - template i know all the factors of
68:15 - foundation and all of its responsiveness
68:17 - but how do i build a website from
68:19 - scratch and that's exactly what we're
68:21 - gonna do right now so right now we're
68:23 - going to build a website from scratch so
68:24 - completely no templates no um
68:27 - no copying pasting all just pure code so
68:30 - we're going to open up a new uh tab and
68:32 - doc uh in adam
68:35 - and we're gonna um open the project as
68:38 - foundation
68:40 - we're just gonna open up our
68:42 - foundation
68:44 - and then we're just gonna exit out of
68:46 - all of these tabs and we're gonna keep
68:49 - this untitled um tab right here we're
68:51 - gonna press uh control shift s
68:55 - and then we're gonna name this one port
68:57 - folio
68:59 - dot html
69:01 - we're gonna save that and then we're
69:03 - gonna make control n
69:05 - and then we're going to put ctrl shift s
69:07 - i'm going to name this one style.css
69:11 - this is going to be our new folders for
69:13 - this new website we're going to make
69:14 - we're going to keep the old folders just
69:16 - so we can refer back to other elements
69:18 - of foundation if we ever need to so what
69:21 - we're going to do first we're just going
69:22 - to type in some basic html
69:24 - just type in the words html it should
69:26 - shortcut to just this
69:28 - uh nice 10 lines of code it'll give you
69:30 - just the the head
69:32 - title body and closing and opening html
69:36 - tags we're going to give html
69:39 - a class called
69:42 - called no dash js we're going to add
69:46 - some more meta tags so we're just going
69:48 - to go
69:49 - meta oops
69:52 - meta tag then we're going to set um
69:56 - and we're going to set http
69:59 - equivalent set at the x equals ua and
70:02 - then dash com compatible and then we're
70:04 - going to set content ie equals
70:07 - edge
70:09 - save that and after that we're going to
70:11 - add another meta tag
70:12 - its name is going to be view
70:15 - port
70:18 - viewport like that now we're going to
70:20 - set content to
70:23 - width equals device
70:26 - width and we're going to add a comma
70:27 - we're going to set initial scale
70:30 - equal to 1.0 and that should be it for
70:34 - that meta tag and now we're going to
70:35 - give it a title we're going to call this
70:38 - portfolio
70:44 - save that and now we're going to link in
70:46 - our links so we're going to just put
70:48 - link tags going to keep style sheet and
70:50 - we're going to put in
70:53 - tss
70:56 - foundation
70:58 - dot css and after that we're gonna put
71:00 - another link and it's gonna be the same
71:01 - thing except for it's gonna be css slash
71:04 - app css that way it has css for mobile
71:06 - too after that we're gonna link our
71:08 - style sheet that's up here right now so
71:11 - we're just going to put in link
71:13 - and then it's going to be just style.css
71:17 - because we didn't put in any folders as
71:19 - you see here it's out right here in the
71:21 - open it's not in any folders so that
71:23 - should set up our head part now we're
71:25 - going to go into the actual code for the
71:27 - body so we're going to start off with a
71:29 - div i'm going to call it title
71:31 - bar and we're going to add another div
71:33 - we're going to give it a class of title
71:35 - bar left
71:37 - so title
71:39 - our
71:40 - left because we're gonna have a title
71:41 - bar on the left we're gonna add another
71:42 - div and the class is gonna be off
71:45 - canvas
71:46 - and then position
71:49 - left
71:51 - so we're gonna we're basically making a
71:53 - um
71:54 - a off canvas menu kind of thing so that
71:57 - when you're on mobile it can work for
71:58 - off canvas as well and then we're gonna
72:00 - add an id
72:02 - not an idea and i d be equal to off
72:06 - can this
72:08 - left
72:09 - and then we're going to add a data
72:11 - off
72:13 - canvas
72:14 - like that now inside of here we're going
72:16 - to add an unloaded list we're going to
72:18 - give this our list a class
72:21 - and it's going to be sub menu gonna be
72:23 - sub menu
72:25 - menu and then bird
72:28 - too cool
72:29 - so it's a vertical menu and then it's
72:30 - gonna have data
72:35 - data submenu now we're going to add list
72:37 - item and inside of these list items are
72:39 - going to be links
72:44 - so we're going to copy this now and
72:46 - we're going to paste it five times or
72:48 - four times and you should have five um
72:51 - link menus
72:53 - now you're just gonna put home
72:55 - skills
72:56 - projects
73:03 - about
73:04 - and then
73:05 - contact so we can navigate through them
73:08 - later we're just going to put home
73:11 - skills
73:15 - projects
73:19 - about
73:21 - and contact
73:24 - and this we're going to put ids in these
73:26 - sections down further into the website
73:28 - so we can navigate to them when we do
73:30 - get there but we're not there just yet
73:32 - so after this unordered list we're gonna
73:33 - put a div and inside of here we're gonna
73:35 - put a button
73:36 - and we can just take out the
73:38 - or we don't have to take out any of this
73:40 - we're gonna put data toggle and then
73:42 - it's gonna equal off
73:45 - canvas left and we don't need the div in
73:47 - this class right here so we can just
73:49 - take that out just to organize it and
73:51 - we're going to give this a class
73:53 - not cool
73:54 - class
73:55 - of menu dash icon and we don't need this
74:00 - type or actually no we don't need this
74:01 - name
74:04 - after that we're gonna put a span
74:06 - it's gonna have a class
74:09 - of title
74:11 - r
74:12 - title we're gonna put
74:14 - portfolio
74:16 - inside of there so inside of the body
74:18 - we're gonna um
74:20 - we're gonna put a div
74:22 - and we're gonna and inside of this div
74:24 - we're gonna give it an id
74:28 - of
74:29 - home and this is what i was talking
74:31 - about up here
74:32 - so when you click the home it's going to
74:33 - lead you down to this div and then we're
74:35 - going to give it a class
74:38 - of hero
74:40 - section
74:41 - and hero
74:42 - section is not in foundation so we're
74:45 - going to add our own personal css that's
74:47 - why we made the file earlier but we'll
74:49 - get to that in a second inside of here
74:51 - we're going to put another div and we're
74:53 - going to put the class as hero dash
74:56 - section dash text
74:59 - and then we're going to put
75:02 - each one and we're going to put your
75:04 - name or in this case my name then we're
75:06 - going to do an h5
75:08 - i'm going to do front and
75:11 - web developer now obviously you can add
75:14 - this to whatever you do uh this is just
75:16 - for the tutorial and so what we need to
75:18 - do now is we need to stylize this so
75:20 - you're gonna go up and click on your css
75:22 - file it's not there you can click this
75:24 - little arrow and click style that css
75:27 - and it'll bring you there
75:29 - um
75:29 - so what we're going to do first we're
75:31 - going to do a hero we're going to
75:33 - 0-section
75:35 - and go like that now before i start
75:37 - typing realize that it may seem like a
75:39 - lot of css but it's 10 times shorter if
75:42 - you were doing it without foundation so
75:45 - just have that in mind i'm going to do
75:47 - background
75:49 - and then url
75:50 - parentheses and i'm gonna copy and paste
75:53 - the image url i found earlier um the
75:55 - link will be in the description
75:57 - obviously we're gonna put parentheses
75:59 - and just paste it in
76:01 - and then at the very end we're gonna put
76:02 - fifty percent
76:04 - no repeat
76:06 - put a semicolon and press enter i'm
76:09 - going to do background
76:12 - size and then cover i'm going to do
76:14 - height
76:16 - 96 vh which is a vertical horizontal
76:20 - is what that means and then
76:23 - text line
76:24 - center and then we're going to do some
76:26 - web kits for the internet explorer users
76:29 - display
76:31 - i'm going to do dash web kit dash flex
76:36 - you're gonna do display
76:38 - and then ms-flex
76:41 - box
76:44 - and make sure you put a dash before that
76:46 - and then after this we're just gonna do
76:48 - normal
76:49 - display
76:50 - flex and then after that you can put
76:52 - webkit dash align
76:55 - dash items and you can just put
76:58 - center and then we're gonna tab and put
77:00 - ms dash flex dash align
77:04 - center
77:07 - and then we're just gonna do normal
77:10 - align items
77:12 - center
77:13 - make sure you put semicolons after all
77:15 - this and after this we're going to put
77:17 - we're going to go back from our
77:18 - indentation put webkit
77:22 - dash defy dash content
77:26 - and we'll just put center and then after
77:29 - that we're going to tap and put dash ms
77:31 - dash flex dash pack
77:34 - center
77:36 - and after that we're just going to do uh
77:37 - justify content center and what this
77:40 - code basically does all these web kits
77:41 - and stuff are basically so that other
77:44 - users can use them as well sometimes it
77:46 - doesn't work on all computers but the
77:48 - webkits make sure that it does work on
77:50 - computers that use internet explorer
77:53 - windows edge or microsoft edge even
77:56 - sometimes web browsers like that are a
77:58 - little bit more complicated
78:00 - so uh web kits tend to help with that
78:03 - and after this we're just going to put
78:05 - euro
78:08 - section
78:09 - and then we're just going to add the
78:10 - second class hero
78:11 - section
78:13 - text and this puts it in a hierarchy so
78:15 - that only text inside of the hero
78:18 - section will work
78:19 - and then we're just gonna add brackets
78:21 - and we're gonna have the color
78:22 - u f e f e
78:25 - we have text
78:27 - shadow one pixel one pixel two pixel and
78:31 - then we add color to it as zero a zero a
78:34 - zero a semicolon and this is all the css
78:37 - we're gonna need for right now so we can
78:39 - go back to our html now before we open
78:41 - it in the browser we need to come down
78:43 - here and add our javascript
78:46 - so we're gonna go in the body we're just
78:48 - gonna kind of indent so we're gonna make
78:50 - a script tag and we're just gonna take
78:52 - out this break right here
78:56 - we're gonna put it as js
78:59 - slash vendor
79:03 - slash
79:04 - jquery js and we're just gonna copy this
79:08 - paste it three more times
79:11 - should have four script tags just change
79:14 - this to what
79:16 - input change this to
79:19 - foundation
79:20 - dot js and this one to
79:25 - app.js
79:27 - and now it should work if we go ahead
79:29 - and check our browser you should get
79:31 - this looking right here now this is a
79:33 - pretty good home page you have our own
79:36 - custom-made heroes section
79:38 - um
79:39 - our little welcome and if you come up
79:42 - here to the navigation you get this side
79:44 - menu right here with all of the
79:46 - basically navigation of the website and
79:49 - if you click home not gonna bring this
79:51 - anywhere because this is already home
79:53 - so but that would work if we were to
79:55 - scroll down
79:56 - and have more parts of the website that
79:59 - would work
80:00 - after this we're gonna add another
80:02 - div we're going to give it
80:05 - an id
80:11 - of skills
80:13 - which we will use later for the
80:14 - navigation and we're going to give it a
80:16 - class of
80:18 - skills
80:21 - we're going to add an h2
80:24 - with the style of
80:27 - text
80:28 - line
80:29 - s
80:31 - then colon center semicolon inside of
80:34 - here we're going to put skills and after
80:37 - this we're going to add an h3 called
80:40 - html and after this we're going to add
80:42 - some progress bars and that's going to
80:44 - show how well we know the skill for this
80:47 - portfolio i'm going to add a div
80:49 - we're going to give this class a and
80:51 - it's going to have primary
80:54 - progress
80:56 - as its class and then roll is going to
80:59 - be progress
81:01 - bar
81:03 - tab index
81:05 - equals zero now we're going to set area
81:09 - value
81:11 - now equal to or we're gonna take out
81:13 - this dash and set it equal to
81:16 - zero actually we're gonna set it equal
81:17 - to 25
81:18 - and we're gonna copy this
81:25 - and we're gonna paste it instead of now
81:27 - we're gonna put
81:28 - min and we're gonna set it to
81:31 - zero we're gonna set we're gonna paste
81:33 - it again instead of now we're gonna put
81:36 - text we're gonna set it equal to 25
81:39 - percent
81:45 - we're gonna paste it again we're gonna
81:46 - set max
81:48 - as instead of now and we're gonna set it
81:50 - to
81:52 - a hundred and then we're gonna uh take
81:55 - this back
81:56 - and we're gonna press enter
81:59 - so there's room inside of this div
82:02 - i'm gonna add another div can it be
82:03 - called progress
82:05 - dash meter
82:06 - and then
82:07 - style
82:09 - we're going to set width
82:11 - to width to 90 percent and then
82:13 - paragraph tag
82:17 - set
82:18 - class equal to
82:19 - progress
82:21 - dash meter
82:23 - text
82:24 - and this should give us one of the
82:26 - progress bars if we check our browser we
82:28 - reload we scroll down we see we get this
82:30 - little uh progress bar down here and
82:32 - then we're gonna uh
82:34 - make a div up here after skills and call
82:37 - it skills
82:38 - dash enter
82:40 - and we're gonna copy
82:42 - uh the progress bar and everything with
82:44 - that
82:45 - inside of here and then we're gonna go
82:47 - into our css tab and uh stylize this
82:50 - skills thing so we're just gonna go
82:52 - skills
82:56 - um curly bracket and then we're gonna
82:58 - set
82:59 - height
83:00 - to 35 vh and then text align
83:05 - center
83:06 - and then background and set it we're
83:08 - going to set it to
83:11 - 4d5768 and then put a semicolon and then
83:14 - we're going to set the skills inner
83:16 - class
83:20 - to width of 50
83:23 - and then margin
83:24 - left 25
83:31 - and then
83:32 - padding bottom 5 pixels and what this
83:35 - basically does is it takes um the normal
83:39 - hero section it makes it smaller
83:41 - and then everything inside of it is
83:42 - going to be centered in the middle
83:44 - inside of a smaller box you go to your
83:46 - browser and reload you should see it
83:48 - like so that this is like all one
83:51 - section and then the the progress bars
83:53 - are in a smaller section inside of it
83:55 - that's what the skills inner
83:57 - class is for so now we can basically
84:00 - copy and paste everything from the h3
84:03 - html tags down to the end of the
84:06 - primary progress so we're just gonna
84:09 - copy this and paste it
84:11 - three times
84:13 - like that and i'm gonna change this to
84:16 - css3
84:18 - and this one to
84:20 - java
84:21 - script
84:22 - es6
84:25 - and then if you want you can change
84:27 - probably should change each of these so
84:29 - let's say each our css is only
84:32 - 85
84:34 - and we change the text down here so 85
84:36 - percent
84:37 - and then javascript let's say it's only
84:40 - 75 percent
84:42 - or just change these values down here if
84:45 - you go to your browser
84:47 - and you reload you should have three
84:48 - more progress bars with different values
84:51 - in them or the values you set to it
84:54 - so um
84:55 - here it shows that html is known ninety
84:58 - percent
84:59 - and i know it css three
85:02 - eighty five percent of the way and
85:03 - javascript es6 about 75 percent of the
85:06 - way now this is just hypothetical for
85:08 - this portfolio but you can change these
85:10 - values to whatever you'd like
85:13 - so after all these divs we're gonna put
85:15 - a div
85:16 - we're gonna give it a class of projects
85:19 - and then we're gonna
85:21 - give it an id of
85:28 - go down here and save that and inside of
85:30 - here we're going to give it a div and a
85:32 - class called project
85:34 - dash box and then we're going to do a
85:37 - a tag or an anchor tag inside of the
85:39 - anchor tag you're gonna do an image now
85:42 - i found this image offline if you want
85:44 - it it's down in the description along
85:46 - with everything else
85:47 - and
85:49 - so i just copied the uh image address
85:52 - and i pasted it and now we're going to
85:54 - add some alt text of port
85:58 - polio
86:00 - after that you're going to put
86:02 - an h2 tag and set the style
86:07 - to uh
86:08 - text dash align
86:12 - center and then
86:14 - we're just gonna put project as filler
86:16 - we're gonna do um
86:19 - we're just gonna do uh
86:22 - personal
86:23 - blog and then after this we're gonna
86:25 - copy
86:26 - this project box
86:28 - two more times
86:29 - we're gonna change the text from uh
86:32 - personal blog to
86:34 - java script
86:36 - bookmarker
86:38 - then we're just going to do um portfolio
86:43 - because i have a second portfolio and if
86:45 - we go ahead and check our browser so
86:47 - before we check the browser we're going
86:48 - to go to our style.css and we're going
86:50 - to make a projects
86:54 - and project
86:57 - project
86:59 - box
87:00 - and we're going to style these so for
87:02 - this one we're going to display
87:04 - flex
87:07 - make sure it's a semicolon and we're
87:09 - going to justify content into the center
87:12 - i'm going to do flex direction and we're
87:14 - going to do row and then
87:17 - flex wrap
87:19 - and then we're gonna do wrap that way if
87:22 - the browser gets smaller it will wrap
87:24 - and make it into a column instead of row
87:26 - and then we're just gonna set the height
87:28 - to 100
87:29 - percent and down in the project box
87:31 - we're going to do
87:32 - margin
87:34 - 15 pixels we're going to do with
87:38 - 250 pixels
87:40 - and height
87:42 - 250 pixels i'm going to order
87:46 - we're gonna do border
87:47 - radius 25 pixels and then background
87:51 - color
87:52 - is going to be black
87:55 - make sure you set this project box to
87:58 - image i forgot about that so the styling
88:00 - won't work correctly without the image
88:03 - um that's just uh targeting the image
88:05 - part of the box we're gonna go ahead and
88:07 - change uh javascript bookmarker because
88:09 - it's kind of a long title and we're just
88:11 - gonna put um
88:14 - js book marker and reload and you should
88:17 - have it looking like this
88:20 - now um you can obviously switch out the
88:21 - pictures i just you i just used the same
88:24 - one for all three just for convenience
88:26 - you should probably change each one of
88:28 - these to your own pictures
88:30 - of your actual uh project but for now
88:32 - this is good
88:34 - after this we're going to add a div
88:36 - and we're going to call it um
88:38 - we're going to give it a class of about
88:41 - and we're going to give it an id
88:44 - of about and then we're going to put a
88:46 - div inside of it call and give it a
88:47 - class of about
88:49 - box i'm going to put an h2 tag in here
88:52 - call it about and then a paragraph tag
88:54 - and then i'mma copy and paste my about
88:56 - from earlier so i'm gonna just paste
88:57 - that in here and then
88:59 - go back and now we're gonna go into the
89:01 - styling
89:02 - and we're gonna add
89:04 - a class of
89:06 - about
89:09 - and about
89:12 - box
89:13 - just set the height
89:15 - to 35 vh
89:17 - not 25 35 and then we're going to set
89:21 - text align
89:22 - center set background color
89:25 - for the background color we're just
89:27 - going to use the same color we did for
89:28 - skills
89:30 - we're just going to paste it down here
89:32 - in semicolon we're going to display flex
89:36 - we're going to align items and then into
89:39 - the center and then we're gonna go down
89:40 - to the about box we're gonna give it a
89:42 - background color we're gonna set it to
89:44 - five e
89:46 - four seven
89:48 - nine nine semicolon and then order
89:51 - radius 25 pixels and then height of 20
89:55 - vh makes you semicolon and then width
89:59 - is going to be 50 and then
90:02 - we're going to margin left
90:03 - about 25 pixels or a percent and just
90:06 - add a little bit of a padding bottom of
90:08 - five pixels
90:10 - change this four seven to
90:12 - seven four i messed up there it will
90:14 - give you purple if you type in four
90:16 - seven so make sure it's seven four you
90:17 - should get this blue color if you reload
90:19 - like this
90:21 - and it gives you a nice soft kind of
90:22 - grayish blue color that kind of looks
90:24 - nice on the eyes and also matches these
90:26 - pictures which i did not plan
90:28 - if you don't like the color scheme you
90:29 - can always change it there wasn't too
90:31 - much designing going into this um
90:33 - website it was mostly just to test every
90:36 - foundation function now one more thing
90:38 - we're just gonna um add another about
90:41 - box
90:42 - so about dash box
90:45 - comma
90:46 - paragraph tag and we're just going to
90:47 - set the padding on this for 5 pixels if
90:50 - you go back to your browser and you
90:51 - reload you see it just gives a nice
90:53 - padding to the
90:54 - the text of the so you can read it so
90:56 - after this we're going to give it
90:58 - another div we're going to add class to
91:01 - contact we're going to give it an id
91:04 - of contact it's just going to be an h2
91:08 - of contact
91:13 - i just put user at domain for the email
91:16 - this is gonna be
91:17 - email
91:19 - just because i'm not gonna put my actual
91:20 - email but you guys should put your
91:22 - actual email if you want your employer
91:24 - to contact you also you don't have to
91:26 - put uh email
91:28 - sometimes it might get confusing it
91:29 - might annoy the user and then we're just
91:31 - gonna put paragraph and we're gonna put
91:33 - a phone number so i'm just putting some
91:35 - random
91:36 - numbers
91:39 - so actually we're just gonna go one two
91:40 - three
91:41 - four five six
91:43 - seven eight nine
91:45 - euro
91:46 - like that i don't know if that's a real
91:48 - phone number i wouldn't find out and
91:50 - after this we're gonna go to our style
91:53 - and we're gonna add a class of contact
91:58 - i'm going to set a background color to
92:01 - uh hashtag
92:02 - 006 ea d
92:05 - and then we're going to set a height
92:07 - of 20 vh
92:10 - and then
92:12 - text align
92:13 - center
92:15 - and then after that if you check your
92:17 - browser and you reload you should have
92:19 - this little blue thing down here contact
92:21 - and then email and phone number and
92:23 - obviously style is that easier this is
92:25 - just like looking like kind of a call
92:27 - out kind of after your body and you're
92:29 - going to type in a footer tag now we're
92:31 - going to just make a quick little footer
92:34 - just for convenience and it's just going
92:35 - to say shadow
92:37 - tech
92:39 - i copied and pasted a copyright sign
92:41 - offline
92:42 - and you can just save that you're going
92:43 - to go back to your style and you're just
92:45 - going to add
92:47 - footer
92:49 - and then you're just going to do text
92:51 - align
92:52 - center
92:55 - and then just set a background color and
92:57 - for convenience just gray
93:00 - and after that if you check your website
93:02 - you should have a fully completed
93:04 - um
93:05 - simple portfolio that was made
93:08 - completely from scratch completely from
93:10 - foundation and it was only in about 80
93:12 - lines of css
93:14 - and around roughly 92 lines of html
93:18 - which is very small for a portfolio our
93:21 - html template was way more than that and
93:24 - this was this is a lot more than the
93:26 - template as well so you get more for
93:28 - less basically so more content for less
93:32 - lines of code for both uh portfolio and
93:34 - css so now that you've built your
93:36 - website in foundation there's a few more
93:39 - things that i think you guys should
93:40 - check out because they're kind of cool
93:42 - and it might be useful so if you go to
93:44 - foundation's website
93:46 - and you click getting started
93:48 - and then you click sites
93:50 - you see you get this little um
93:53 - page here
93:54 - and well this is where we found the html
93:57 - templates and there's some other things
93:59 - called building blocks
94:01 - now as it may seem you can literally
94:03 - click see code
94:05 - and add this to your um
94:08 - to your website and you can basically
94:10 - give ratings
94:13 - based off of you know like what you
94:16 - would be rating it on basically like you
94:19 - can copy this code click copy copy and
94:21 - copy and just paste each one in
94:24 - and you'd have to add your own
94:25 - javascript through a script tag inside
94:28 - of your uh website but that shouldn't be
94:30 - much of a problem and it basically gives
94:32 - you all the code
94:34 - for the um what it the building block is
94:37 - so in this case it's a star rating block
94:39 - and these are created by other people as
94:40 - you see this person
94:42 - made this but
94:44 - you can have your own profiles i guess
94:48 - but if you go back there's different
94:50 - things so you can go to navigation you
94:52 - can have these cool little uh
94:53 - navigations that people have made in
94:55 - foundation
94:57 - um
94:58 - status
95:04 - you can add status alerts and uh graphs
95:06 - and stuff
95:08 - um you can also do control
95:11 - and see social icons
95:13 - there's a lot of social buttons
95:16 - look at the social buttons
95:18 - easy so you can literally copy which
95:20 - parts you want so if i only wanted
95:22 - facebook twitter and youtube
95:25 - and instagram i would just copy these
95:27 - and then
95:28 - just copy all this because if you want
95:30 - to add more you can add more
95:32 - basically take out which links you want
95:34 - out and you can link in your own social
95:36 - media
95:37 - inside of these hashtags
95:43 - there's also mobile dashboards
95:46 - and instead of making our own hero we've
95:49 - could have we could have gone here
95:51 - and just clicked full screen hero
95:55 - and copy this code
95:57 - down here
95:59 - and could have done it that way
96:02 - but we decided to make it our own since
96:04 - we were creating our own website from
96:06 - scratch but if you do want to make
96:08 - another hero you can just come in here
96:10 - to the building blocks and find full
96:13 - screen hero
96:15 - and just edit it that way
96:19 - if you go back
96:23 - we go back all the way to where it says
96:25 - html templates you're gonna click uh
96:27 - resources and down here there's all
96:29 - sorts of add-ons for angular and for
96:32 - text editors and wordpress
96:34 - all this back-end stuff and this is
96:36 - where we would connect the back end with
96:38 - like our buttons and stuff
96:40 - where is it
96:42 - down here django
96:43 - your net.net and uh it looks like other
96:47 - backend stuff like flask for python
96:50 - php um
96:52 - ass foundation
96:54 - anyway up here you can see there's uh
96:56 - icon fonts
96:58 - which are just some like random stuff i
97:00 - guess you could put into your website
97:02 - svg icons
97:04 - oh so like social media icons
97:07 - and if you click getting started this is
97:08 - where we downloaded uh you can click
97:11 - kitchen sink and obviously go through
97:12 - kitchen sink
97:14 - you click home
97:15 - it gives you like a description of how
97:17 - foundation works so uh 50 code reduction
97:21 - so half the size of foundation five this
97:23 - is foundation six so they've upgraded it
97:26 - and if you keep scrolling through you
97:27 - can read all about their development
97:30 - and how foundation is apparently the
97:32 - best uh front-end framework that's
97:34 - responsive in the world is what they
97:36 - claim so throughout this entire course
97:38 - or crash course we've learned a lot and
97:40 - let's go over what we have learned so we
97:42 - went through all of kitchen sync which
97:44 - gave us every element of foundation all
97:47 - in one let's say document and we saved
97:51 - that website just as foundation after
97:53 - that we went on to html templates and we
97:56 - basically learned how foundation is
97:58 - structured using one of their templates
98:00 - and we edited the template so that it
98:02 - looks like our personal pro portfolio
98:04 - then after that we basically made our
98:06 - own portfolio from scratch
98:09 - and we made it so that we coded the
98:11 - entire thing we basically coded the
98:13 - entire portfolio from scratch not using
98:16 - any templates or anything just using
98:17 - foundation and it gave us a 50
98:20 - code reduction from the normal portfolio
98:22 - without foundation so basically um
98:25 - that's all for foundation i know this
98:27 - was a kind of a long crash course
98:30 - especially just for foundation but i
98:31 - made sure that you guys got all the
98:33 - content of foundation so don't forget to
