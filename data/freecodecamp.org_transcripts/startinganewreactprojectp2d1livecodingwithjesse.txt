00:06 - hey everyone its Jesse and today I'm
00:10 - really excited that I get to start a new
00:14 - brand new project as if you've all been
00:19 - watching for the last month or so I've
00:21 - been working on the same project and I'm
00:24 - just so I'm so happy to be be finished
00:27 - with the project and it I'm happy with
00:30 - the way it turned out and I learned a
00:32 - lot on the project and you all helped me
00:34 - so much but it's good to start start
00:39 - something new so I had a lot of people
00:43 - give me feedback that they wanted to see
00:47 - a project from the very beginning so
00:51 - this this is it this is we're gonna
00:54 - start from scratch you can see I have I
00:56 - have nothing this is literally nothing
00:58 - on the screen right now so I'm gonna
01:01 - start you know here even even my
01:03 - terminal is I haven't even typed one
01:07 - command yet and I have a blank Trello
01:12 - board so no no work at all beforehand
01:16 - we're gonna start this up you know from
01:19 - scratch so the first thing that we're
01:23 - gonna do is I'm gonna go over what the
01:27 - project is and what the requirements are
01:29 - and then that's gonna be determined how
01:31 - we set things up alright so since the
01:34 - the point of this dream is to show what
01:37 - you know what it's like for me as a
01:39 - developer I want to show the whole
01:42 - process so I'm not gonna jump right into
01:46 - the code we need to get a little bit of
01:48 - planning in as well so and I hopefully
01:50 - you all can help me in that planning
01:53 - process so it looks like we have a lot
01:56 - of viewers right now I'm gonna try my
01:58 - best to keep up with a live chat but
01:59 - it's going pretty fast right now so let
02:03 - me pull over my timer so we're gonna use
02:08 - the last couple of shows have been using
02:10 - this
02:11 - timer and I'm gonna start this and then
02:14 - that way every time this Pomodoro timer
02:17 - goes off we'll take a five-minute break
02:19 - and during that break I'll make sure I'd
02:21 - catch up on as much of the live chat as
02:23 - I possibly can and then during the other
02:25 - 25 minutes I'll try to dedicate that
02:28 - mostly to focusing on the task at hand
02:32 - so hey everyone and I see a lot of a lot
02:36 - of people saying hi let me show you so
02:43 - here's what the project is going to be I
02:45 - want I already know ahead of time I want
02:47 - to do this and react and I just said
02:53 - somebody said in the the Instagram feed
02:56 - so I the secondary feed for this dream
03:01 - is on Instagram and it's the view of my
03:03 - face as I'm coding and I just had a
03:06 - question in there it was from some from
03:09 - one of my former students and he asked
03:11 - who is your favorite X student so and
03:13 - that's from from D tribe that was of
03:17 - course his nickname but D trav since no
03:21 - since none of my other students are
03:22 - watching this dream right now
03:23 - I'm gonna say you were one of my
03:26 - favorites now I don't I can say that
03:28 - without lying at all I really did like
03:30 - having you in my classes so you're a
03:33 - good guy so anyway thanks for watching
03:36 - so I hope everything's going well with
03:38 - you but I'm gonna get to work now so
03:45 - anyway I know I want to do this project
03:47 - and react because I've been working in
03:49 - reactants on a course and react right
03:50 - now some future sites are gonna be in
03:52 - react so if you're tired of me doing
03:55 - things in react I'm sorry it's gonna be
03:58 - more react unless there's some really
04:00 - really good reason that you all can come
04:02 - up with why I should do this using
04:03 - something else it's probably going to be
04:06 - a react project so let me explain what's
04:09 - going on so my very first project here
04:13 - at this job almost two years ago my
04:18 - first project was to make what they
04:20 - called a resource center so I work in
04:22 - the marketing department and
04:25 - we do a lot of things for all the
04:28 - departments here on campus at this
04:29 - university so we were constantly getting
04:31 - requests from people lots of people in
04:34 - different departments and we we just
04:41 - didn't keep track of them well and
04:43 - sometimes things would fall through the
04:44 - cracks you know if we're getting at each
04:45 - request sometimes it would be you just
04:48 - happen to pass somebody by when you're
04:50 - you know walking from one building to
04:52 - another and they mentioned something or
04:54 - a phone call or email so you'd see how
04:56 - it easily would get overwhelming and
04:58 - then there's no record of what we you
05:00 - know what we did so my original goal was
05:04 - to come up with some system where we
05:06 - could track everything where people
05:08 - could submit you know what they wanted
05:10 - us to do and also where they could get
05:13 - resources that they were constantly
05:15 - asking us for like logos they could just
05:18 - go on and get it themselves without
05:20 - having to email people or call people so
05:24 - I did that and it worked it was great
05:26 - but now it's time to redo it and update
05:29 - it so let me show you the old one to
05:33 - give you an idea of what we're working
05:36 - with and what we need and so I'm gonna
05:39 - pull this over on the screen let me make
05:42 - it a little bigger and so this this is
05:47 - our current I guess kind of internal
05:51 - site this runs on it's called J ICS so a
05:56 - company called Jenzabar makes this for
06:00 - for higher education for universities so
06:04 - this is the homepage I did not design
06:06 - this I'm not gonna say any more about it
06:09 - but it was not me I'm gonna log in and
06:12 - show you the part of this that I did
06:14 - design and so
06:22 - let me just tell you when I click this
06:25 - basically I do some things with z-index
06:28 - to where the the page that comes up just
06:31 - hides all the stuff that's behind it it
06:33 - goes in front of it so you can see
06:38 - there's definitely some weird stuff
06:40 - going on when it loads but this is it
06:41 - all right so yeah yeah let's take the
06:49 - live chat I'm there so that really was
06:51 - the menu yeah can you believe that
06:54 - yeah so it's I think that's safe to say
06:57 - that the UI for that is terrible I don't
07:00 - think I'm gonna offend anybody here at
07:02 - the University I think it's the there's
07:08 - a general consensus that UI is terrible
07:11 - so the good news is that that UI is
07:14 - gonna change the bad news is I'm gonna
07:17 - have to redo all what I've already done
07:20 - because Jenzabar has finally decided
07:22 - that it's a good idea to have a
07:24 - responsive website so I'm really glad
07:29 - because it's 2017 and they're finally
07:34 - having a responsive site so they're
07:37 - coming down they're coming out with
07:40 - their version 9 which totally will
07:46 - conflict with any custom themes that
07:48 - have been done so far so I've been
07:50 - seeing that the only real way to get
07:53 - information about Jenzabar stuff is on
07:55 - their listserv it's crazy this company
07:58 - is just like I don't know like straight
08:01 - out of the 90s and never changed and
08:03 - I've been seeing over the listserv a lot
08:07 - of people have been having trouble when
08:08 - they've upgraded with their UI just
08:10 - breaking so I'm expecting that to happen
08:13 - so I've decided that I'm not gonna try
08:15 - to develop it within here because let me
08:18 - show you this is how I have to edit it I
08:23 - have to actually go into here let me
08:26 - show you the Javas fits here so
08:32 - I need to go in
08:36 - let me find see it's crazy I can't even
08:42 - find what I'm supposed to find let me
08:44 - refresh literally if I want to make any
08:47 - edit I have to copy and paste into here
08:51 - into these little text boxes so I'll
08:55 - show you again you can see it's it's so
08:57 - frustrating I mean I've spent hours on
08:59 - this and it's still hard to remember the
09:02 - sequence of clicks that I have to go
09:06 - through so let me show you well I don't
09:13 - see I'm not even sure why that well so I
09:18 - can't even I actually can't even click
09:21 - them I can't even show you where the the
09:27 - boxes to edit this because evidently
09:30 - this entire page now has become a link
09:33 - to canva so you can see the frustration
09:37 - and trying to develop this so I am
09:39 - definitely not going to try to make what
09:42 - I made work with whatever a new system
09:47 - they come out with so that's out of the
09:49 - question
09:50 - we're definitely we're doing this it's
09:52 - going to be hosted most likely on a
09:54 - digitalocean server and I'm just gonna
09:57 - link to it from within this they call it
10:01 - my Franciscan but this kind of a
10:03 - university intranet alright so these are
10:07 - the main things that we need this this
10:10 - site to do the some of these are just
10:15 - links so this brand manual this is just
10:17 - a link to PDF super easy so it needs to
10:19 - be able to link to resources we need to
10:23 - be able to let people download different
10:26 - versions of our logos so this is what I
10:31 - have set up this is using I think
10:36 - isotope or masonry yeah so just has two
10:43 - logos you can download
10:45 - different versions of the logos and it
10:49 - does the so anyway that's that's one of
10:57 - the main features I think the poster one
10:59 - is simply some links and some
11:03 - information not a big deal
11:06 - letterhead is also just some some
11:08 - samples some images not a big deal I'm
11:12 - just going to skip ahead the rest is
11:13 - pretty much the same a lot of text the
11:15 - only thing that's gonna be a little bit
11:17 - of a big deal is this form so the form
11:21 - is actually going to change a little bit
11:23 - we want to change this wording but as I
11:25 - said I'm I'm holding off on making any
11:27 - updates to this until we totally redo it
11:30 - because I'm I'm not gonna try to go
11:32 - through the the headache of you know
11:35 - copy and pasting every change so
11:39 - basically we just we need a form we need
11:41 - that form to be to be able to upload
11:43 - files and then we need the data from the
11:46 - form to go directly into our project
11:47 - management system which we use rike for
11:50 - project management so it needs to go
11:52 - into rike and it also needs to send out
11:54 - an email to the person that's submitted
11:57 - saying that hey we your submission went
11:59 - through and then it also needs to send
12:01 - out an email to someone here in my
12:02 - department saying that someone submitted
12:06 - something okay so those are the basic
12:09 - you know just the very basic things that
12:11 - it needs to do so this is not gonna be
12:14 - you know really really difficult project
12:17 - now I'm open to changing anything in
12:20 - this UI so you can see this was early on
12:24 - this was before I kind of refined the
12:27 - brand standards for this university and
12:31 - but it basically adheres to a lot of
12:34 - what we're doing you know you can see
12:35 - material design elements here you can
12:38 - see it has you know some of the proper
12:40 - shadows and things border-radius so it
12:43 - has familiar elements to some things but
12:46 - if i'm going to redo it I may as well
12:48 - update the UI I don't want to make it I
12:51 - don't want to really startle people but
12:54 - if the UI for my franciscan is gonna
12:57 - change
12:57 - completely it shouldn't be that big of a
13:00 - deal if this UI also changes because
13:02 - people will most likely expect it to
13:04 - change if everything else is changing as
13:06 - well I currently do have all the other
13:10 - links to things in my Franciscan
13:15 - here.these I probably won't be able to
13:17 - pull these over and I don't really know
13:20 - that I would I even want to if we're
13:22 - gonna make a new a new site that's not
13:25 - within my Franciscan so anyway that's
13:30 - the that's it I mean that's that's the
13:33 - project requirements
13:34 - I have probably I'm gonna say like three
13:38 - weeks do I want to try to get this done
13:40 - in you know give it give or take a week
13:45 - so I'm gonna go to the live chat I want
13:48 - to see what you all think based on what
13:51 - I said so here's here's what I would
13:53 - like your opinion on I'd like to know
13:59 - well one is there any really good reason
14:02 - why I should not use react I'm I'm like
14:04 - 99% sure I want to use react but just in
14:08 - case there's something I'm overlooking
14:11 - then you know I'm open to that also
14:16 - should I use next j/s like we did for
14:20 - the last project or should I use
14:21 - something else like create react app or
14:25 - should I
14:26 - I really do actually I don't want to
14:27 - attempt to do it completely from scratch
14:28 - and set up a web pack config and
14:30 - everything because I just don't think I
14:33 - have enough time to really learn that
14:35 - properly maybe I'll save that for for a
14:39 - later project but I'm kind of thinking I
14:41 - ought to just use next j/s I'm really
14:44 - familiar with it I could develop quickly
14:47 - with that I don't necessarily need the
14:50 - server-side rendering this is not a site
14:54 - that I need to be indexed by search
14:56 - engines
14:58 - the routing that comes with it would be
15:01 - nice but there's not a whole lot of
15:03 - routing that needs to happen right now
15:04 - this is all just I didn't show any the
15:07 - code for this but this is all
15:10 - jQuery even the routing is with jQuery
15:14 - so these they have hashes for the links
15:17 - and they all work so you can actually go
15:20 - to you know to the URL assuming that you
15:24 - had a login and it would take you the
15:26 - right spot so that was all custom jQuery
15:29 - routing but let me look at let me look
15:37 - at some of your responses I see there's
15:39 - a lot of stuff in here let's see oh I'll
15:47 - see if there's any questions - I guess
15:49 - I'll answer them now I wonder what I'm
15:51 - not
15:52 - yeah I'm not not quite to the time yet
15:54 - for questions but since I asked you all
15:56 - so many questions I'm just gonna check
15:58 - the live chat now yes some people were
16:04 - commenting on how many people were
16:05 - waiting they were actually at 10 people
16:08 - waiting at one point for this for the
16:11 - video that was really awesome while
16:13 - we're up to a decent number of years to
16:16 - 163 that's well above what we normally
16:19 - get so I assume there's some new people
16:21 - here watching for the first time so
16:23 - welcome and please feel free to join in
16:27 - a live chat if you can your I really
16:30 - value your opinion and helping to figure
16:33 - out how we're gonna do these projects so
16:36 - I have some questions where are you from
16:43 - I'm from originally I'm from West
16:45 - Virginia in the United States but now I
16:47 - live in Ohio I'm actually right on the
16:49 - border of Ohio so I'm closer to
16:52 - Pittsburgh Pennsylvania you may know
16:54 - that's kind of a bigger city so you may
16:56 - know where that is
17:00 - someone asks do you go live I do stream
17:02 - every weekday unless something comes up
17:05 - where I can't like on Monday I I wasn't
17:07 - working so but I try to stream every
17:10 - weekday at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time
17:23 - let's see I'm skipping over some stuff
17:26 - here I will go back through though and
17:28 - at the end and try to answer as many
17:31 - questions as I can
17:37 - Earl asks do you charge for services on
17:39 - your campus no we currently don't charge
17:41 - for the services on the campus although
17:43 - I I am I think as a department we should
17:49 - charge and that would give people a
17:52 - better idea of how much things actually
17:54 - cost and whether or not it's a good idea
17:57 - because I think right now people just
17:59 - think okay we're starting a new thing we
18:00 - want video we want print materials we
18:03 - want an email campaign and a new website
18:05 - and all the stuff because they never see
18:08 - the bill for that necessarily I mean
18:10 - they have to pay for the printing and
18:11 - things but I I think it would people
18:15 - would be more realistic about what's
18:17 - what's possible what's reasonable if
18:20 - they did have to pay someone mentioned
18:23 - that I am salaried yes I am salaried
18:26 - here okay the someone mentioned that the
18:34 - microphone is buzzing it's probably my
18:36 - phone I'll try to move my phone a bit
18:38 - farther away let me know if the mic is
18:40 - is still buzzing I moved it a bit
18:52 - I see yes so people were saying it makes
18:56 - them want to cry when they saw that
18:58 - sight yeah that was the first thing I
19:01 - saw when I came here my very first
19:03 - project and I was just it's amazing that
19:09 - I stayed
19:23 - all right so I'm getting to so there's
19:29 - just so much in the live chat going on
19:30 - I'm I'm trying to find I know I saw some
19:33 - people give me suggestions about what we
19:35 - should build this in here we go Santa
19:41 - said if you need an app - why not
19:42 - refactor in react native it would be
19:51 - cool actually to make this an app that
19:54 - would be really cool okay so you have
19:57 - people saying yeah you use react
19:59 - some people said in XJS okay pre-act
20:03 - create RAC react app don't reinvent the
20:06 - wheel create that okay so we had some
20:09 - people a lot of people saying create
20:11 - react app
20:24 - okay maybe we'll do that then we'll use
20:29 - create react at all right let's do that
20:37 - it looks like we had a lot of people
20:39 - saying use create react app so I'm gonna
20:41 - go with that we're gonna use create
20:43 - react app and then we'll use we don't
20:47 - need anything crazy for routing so we'll
20:50 - just use basic like reactor outer and I
20:58 - think that'll work
21:01 - that should work yeah so I will say this
21:07 - this is going to be a more of a learning
21:08 - experience for me because I do have a
21:10 - lot more experience with next j/s more
21:14 - so than I do with create react app so
21:20 - I'm gonna be learning along with you I
21:22 - am using create react app in my react
21:27 - course that I'm doing right now and
21:28 - that's the one from Udacity so I'm not
21:31 - and I have used it before so I had up on
21:36 - my screen oh here we go
21:37 - I had it ready basically I had the neck
21:39 - next and create react app ready to go so
21:43 - we can kind of walk through some of the
21:47 - installation process let's so let's also
21:51 - start I'm gonna show you how we how at
21:54 - least I plan out my projects so I'm
21:57 - gonna do it to do ready ready for dev in
22:04 - progress testing and done and then
22:13 - wishlist okay so we're just gonna make
22:17 - some basic cards so it's gonna be
22:25 - and whenever I do things I always put an
22:29 - estimate so I'm gonna include some other
22:31 - setup things in there that's what I'm
22:33 - saying it's gonna take I estimate how
22:35 - many Pomodoro cycles everything will
22:37 - take so let's see see what else you want
22:44 - to do I kind of don't want to break down
22:50 - everything right now yeah I'm gonna
22:53 - unless somebody really wants to see this
22:55 - I'm gonna fill out these cards
22:58 - afterwards because I'd like to get
23:00 - pretty detailed and all the steps and
23:02 - that will probably take a long time it
23:04 - won't be that fun to watch so since we
23:07 - are gonna work on this today I'll just
23:09 - fill this one out and I'll move it two
23:10 - in progress but the idea is I take all
23:13 - the tests I know I need to do is tomato
23:15 - how much time it's gonna take and then I
23:17 - move them along the process and when
23:20 - it's done I also say how much time it
23:23 - really took and I don't think this is
23:29 - public now but I'll make this public so
23:31 - y'all can see it as well all right so
23:34 - let's take to make I'm gonna make the
23:37 - font size a bit bigger so y'all can see
23:40 - and this is just the create react app
23:43 - github repo if you want to follow along
23:50 - so let's go through the setup process
23:56 - I want to keep all of my projects in a
24:01 - projects folder and let's say the
24:08 - Resource Center yeah okay so I'm not
24:18 - gonna use NPM I'm gonna use yarn so
24:21 - let's go yarn if you're not familiar
24:24 - with yarn well if you're not familiar
24:27 - with NPM at all this is a way to install
24:30 - node modules so nodejs is a way to use
24:33 - JavaScript server-side and not just in
24:37 - the browser and so NPM is the way that
24:40 - you pull in different little bits of
24:42 - code that people have written and
24:45 - packaged up in these little modules so
24:47 - you pull them in with this command line
24:49 - tool called a node package manager or
24:51 - NPM yarn it basically does everything
24:54 - that NPM does but it adds a few extra
24:57 - features one thing it does is it seems
24:59 - to be a bit faster and it keeps better
25:03 - track of like the exact versions of
25:05 - things so for now if you're new just
25:09 - know that you can use yarn or NPM
25:12 - interchangeably and they'll both they'll
25:15 - work so I'm gonna pull in this create
25:20 - react app NPM package so I'm gonna go
25:27 - yarn add so just a little bit different
25:32 - create react app and I don't think I
25:36 - have
25:41 - I'm not gonna worry about installing
25:44 - this globally right now I'm not really
25:49 - sure how many times I'll use this we'll
25:51 - see how it goes with this project
25:52 - alright so actually let me see if this
25:58 - created I'm going to open this up an
26:04 - atom it should have yep it did okay so
26:05 - we have now a package.json file with
26:11 - this dependency of create react app I
26:13 - didn't fill out anything else from the
26:15 - package.json file but I can always do
26:16 - that later on and now let's create the
26:26 - app so we'll type in create react app
26:32 - and then we're gonna name it I should
26:41 - have done I should have done this one
26:45 - level up oh wow
27:06 - alright it looks like the mic is still
27:09 - buzzing so I'm gonna move I'm gonna move
27:15 - my my phone try to get it farther away
27:21 - I made you soft I had it plugged in
27:24 - charging right now but I may just have
27:25 - to keep it unplugged and move it like
27:28 - really far away all right let me know if
27:39 - that's it yeah okay Sebastian I see your
27:41 - thing so I did realize this so I let me
27:47 - let me just go back because I messed
27:49 - this up I really should have installed
27:52 - this globally and I wasn't thinking when
27:54 - I first did it so dang it and I wasn't
28:02 - thinking then I got sidetracked and
28:04 - typed in so let's let me go back out
28:06 - here oops
28:22 - so I'm gonna remove recursively
28:25 - everything in that Resource Center
28:27 - folder all right so now I am gonna do
28:30 - this properly and they already have this
28:33 - installed nice I think it's on my laptop
28:38 - I don't think I installed it here right
28:40 - now I'm working on an iMac okay so now
28:46 - let's try this again the correct way
28:49 - now's a great time to give my normal
28:52 - disclaimer that this is entirely live
28:54 - and not rehearsed so you will see all of
28:56 - my mistakes I do my best to not make
28:59 - them but as you know like everyone I'm
29:03 - not perfect so we'll make mistakes and
29:04 - you'll see that hopefully you all can
29:07 - learn from my mistakes along with me and
29:11 - maybe you know you won't make them
29:12 - because I've already done it create
29:16 - react and now we're gonna call this
29:20 - center resource sensor today let me make
29:26 - this a bit bigger I just occurred to me
29:28 - that this was still pretty small all
29:32 - right so now this is doing its thing
29:34 - it's installing so if you're gonna if
29:41 - you want to try this out and read all
29:43 - this insulation stuff you can but
29:44 - basically it's just it's installing
29:46 - everything that we need to build a react
29:50 - site all right so while that's running
29:54 - I'm gonna come back and catch up a bit
29:56 - with a live chat I think my timer did go
29:58 - off let me find it here yeah it did and
30:02 - I I didn't click the break so the short
30:04 - break so let me take a few minutes I'm
30:07 - going to go back through and try to
30:08 - answer some questions especially if
30:10 - anyone's new he asked some questions
30:13 - definitely want to get to your questions
30:18 - hey everyone yeah I'm seeing a lot of
30:20 - new people so welcome I really
30:22 - appreciate you watching and feel free to
30:24 - ask any questions I'll try to get to as
30:26 - many questions as I can
30:28 - and
30:28 - [Music]
30:29 - don't worry if you're new and you're not
30:32 - sure what's going on I'm happy to
30:35 - explain anything so just let me know
30:47 - let's see rah rah choo says can you
30:50 - please train us with some Java projects
30:52 - I don't do anything with Java at least
30:57 - not for years I haven't done anything
30:59 - with Java so I won't be doing anything
31:02 - with that
31:12 - Carlos asked with terminal I'm using its
31:14 - I term I think it's I turn to so yeah it
31:19 - should say yeah I term to Earl says very
31:28 - cool that you're doing this for everyone
31:29 - thank you thanks for saying that
31:31 - hopefully you all can get something
31:33 - beneficial out of this I know I do from
31:35 - all of your input I get Kaz Kazik I
31:47 - can't pronounce that but if the first
31:49 - part is Kazakh says hey Jesse many
31:51 - thanks for what you're doing you're
31:54 - welcome thank you so much for watching
31:55 - and for saying that Park Ryan says love
32:02 - free code can't live awesome I love that
32:04 - you're watching thank you for saying
32:06 - that
32:10 - Philip said marketing something Philips
32:13 - and marketing as well I I think I
32:17 - remember talking about that before with
32:20 - you
32:25 - I just saw Raunak said from 1995 to 2017
32:34 - in one click yes so this when I went
32:36 - from the from the one site into what I
32:41 - had done for it yeah everybody was
32:44 - really surprised whenever I built that
32:46 - it kind of caused I don't know if I want
32:50 - to say trouble exactly but it was like
32:54 - it caused trouble in that other
32:57 - departments then immediately wanted
32:59 - similar things for their sections of it
33:02 - and so that kind of caused trouble
33:05 - because people were asking
33:08 - they were asking the people who were in
33:11 - charge of that site to do the same thing
33:13 - that I did and it just so it was a
33:15 - little bit weird I was happy that
33:17 - everybody liked it so much but it was
33:19 - there's a little bit of tension over it
33:29 - okay so this would work so I'm I didn't
33:32 - get through all the all the live chat
33:36 - because there's so much in there right
33:38 - now which is which is awesome I think
33:40 - that's that's so great you all are so
33:43 - active in the chat I just see Umberto's
33:50 - comment
33:51 - it says mumbles dotnet core with react
33:54 - test Hut net so yeah I'm not gonna be
33:57 - doing any done that stuff anytime soon
33:59 - although the we do have some sites that
34:03 - run on dotnet that I'll probably need to
34:05 - be doing something with so it's possible
34:09 - there might be some dotnet stuff
34:10 - happening so I'm gonna go back let's see
34:13 - I guess my 5 minutes isn't up so let me
34:16 - I said I'd give 5 minutes to live chat
34:18 - so as soon as that timer's up I'll go
34:21 - back to it let's see okay so Scottie
34:26 - says Scottie is new so hey welcome
34:29 - welcome Ron access new awesome
34:34 - Mehmet says I don't understand how devs
34:37 - can allow client-side rendering because
34:39 - my first rule was never to trust the
34:41 - client yeah I mean there's benefits to
34:44 - doing client-side rendering so I mean I
34:46 - wouldn't obviously the the best I like
34:51 - to do both to have server-side rendering
34:54 - and client-side then you get the
34:57 - benefits of each so you know that's my
35:00 - preference but I certainly I don't like
35:05 - to render everything client-side unless
35:08 - there's no other way which there's
35:11 - usually another way all right so yeah I
35:18 - didn't get through everything in the
35:19 - chat but I'm gonna go back over to here
35:23 - so we can kind of get through some stuff
35:25 - and I'll I'll come back into the chat I
35:27 - did just want to get through that first
35:29 - part because once we get a lot of
35:31 - messages I won't be able to read the
35:33 - stuff that you all put in the live chat
35:35 - earlier on all right so let's check out
35:39 - the message that has given us here
35:42 - success awesome we created resource
35:46 - center inside that directory okay so
35:49 - it's telling us the commands that we can
35:51 - use and using yarn as well so we can
35:56 - start our dev server which is yarn start
36:00 - we can build our files if we need to
36:04 - which we don't need we won't need to do
36:06 - that for a long time and okay we can run
36:10 - tests and then if we want to I don't
36:12 - know that we're gonna have to do this
36:13 - but we might at some point we might need
36:16 - to do this and we might need to use yarn
36:18 - eject and when we do that then we're
36:24 - going to be able to configure things a
36:26 - lot more than we can now so create react
36:29 - app is it's really nice because it gets
36:32 - you started with things without needing
36:35 - to know anything about webpack or all
36:37 - the build tools that you're using but
36:39 - the you have to give up some of the
36:42 - freedom to customize in order to get
36:44 - that and if you don't eject then you can
36:46 - take advantage of all the updates that
36:48 - come out but once you checked then you
36:51 - have to handle some of that stuff on
36:52 - your own
36:53 - so we'll see we might need to eject at
36:57 - some point I'm thinking possibly to
37:00 - handle some of like the file upload
37:05 - things because what I've used I have you
37:07 - some things in the past that I'll need
37:09 - to do like some custom stuff with so
37:12 - we'll see if we can make it through
37:15 - without having to eject that would be
37:17 - ideal but I'm not opposed to doing it
37:20 - alright so as they say we could start by
37:25 - seeding into resource center so let's do
37:29 - it and then typing in yarn start so
37:36 - let's see what port
37:40 - we're starting the dev server showed up
37:43 - in this little tiny window alright so
37:47 - here we go
37:48 - so here it is as you can see it didn't
37:51 - take that long it would have been really
37:53 - really fast if I hadn't to spend so much
37:55 - time messing it up and then talking but
37:59 - in very you know very small amount of
38:02 - time and effort we now have a react site
38:06 - and it works I love that little
38:08 - animation that's cool
38:12 - we actually we also have this available
38:15 - in the network which I didn't realize
38:17 - that the last time I built that I didn't
38:19 - even know so that's really cool
38:21 - so obviously this is not what we're
38:24 - gonna keep so we're gonna get rid of all
38:26 - of this and everything but it's good to
38:27 - know that at least it's it's working so
38:30 - let's check out what code we have now in
38:33 - that let's see and I think I'm just
38:41 - gonna exit this because I set our old
38:44 - stuff that when I messed it up and I'm
38:46 - gonna duplicate this tab because this is
38:49 - going to stay open with our server but
38:51 - then now I can't do anything on it so
38:53 - I'm gonna duplicate that so now I'm in
38:55 - here and I want to see I'm going to type
38:58 - in atom and then dot and that's gonna
39:02 - open up atom and let's get rid of these
39:09 - welcome guides and let's see what we
39:11 - have let me make the font a bit bigger
39:14 - all right so here's our package JSON
39:17 - file if you're not familiar with this
39:18 - this is the file that it lets us know a
39:21 - little bit about the project and what
39:23 - dependencies that we're using so like
39:26 - what other packages so essentially when
39:29 - we have a package JSON our project is
39:32 - now an NPM module no we're not really
39:36 - worried about most of the time nobody's
39:38 - gonna download our stuff as a module
39:41 - rafe we're just trying to create a site
39:42 - but the official name and everything is
39:47 - you know this is kind of like an NPM
39:49 - module how it would normally be set up
39:51 - so
39:53 - we're not really worried about I I don't
39:56 - worry too much about editing kind of
39:59 - this this up here what we want to worry
40:03 - about more our dependencies and our
40:06 - scripts we're not gonna change anything
40:08 - right now
40:09 - at some point later on we might though
40:13 - we might want to add in some you know
40:17 - some things to process or CSS well we'll
40:25 - see we'll see what we need as we go on
40:29 - and let's see it did make a readme for
40:33 - us right now
40:35 - this readme has a lot of stuff a lot of
40:40 - stuff about create react app so at some
40:45 - point we'll probably do a proper readme
40:49 - for for our project but for now I'm
40:53 - gonna leave this in here and possibly
40:56 - refer to it if necessary and let's see
41:01 - what else do we have the yarn lock is a
41:03 - file you'll probably you'll never want
41:05 - to update this manually and then you
41:09 - have your git ignore so this is gonna so
41:14 - we're gonna use git for this project but
41:17 - this is going to tell get the files that
41:19 - it doesn't need to worry about tracking
41:21 - okay so this is pretty standard you
41:24 - generally don't want to track your node
41:25 - modules and depending on what you're
41:29 - using for your project you might have
41:31 - different things that you're not going
41:32 - going to track so the next step
41:42 - is let's check out our source and so I
41:49 - want to open up some of the pages so
41:51 - this is our index j/s okay so all this
41:54 - is doing is pull import importing some
41:57 - things and then we're rendering the app
42:02 - component so let's check out our app
42:07 - component so we have a tas and this is
42:12 - where we start to see like things that
42:14 - actually look like HTML and this is
42:18 - called JSX so it does look like HTML but
42:22 - it behaves a little bit differently so
42:26 - we use classname instead of class that's
42:29 - kind of a big obvious thing right off
42:30 - the bat and then we can actually put
42:32 - JavaScript inside of brackets so this
42:35 - logo here is actually a JavaScript you
42:42 - know variable we're calling on we've
42:44 - imported logo from the logo dot from
42:48 - logo dot SVG so those are just a few of
42:53 - the different things and we can see we
42:59 - can change change some things so I'm
43:01 - going to add some exclamation points
43:03 - because I'm super excited and I'll show
43:06 - you see now we have the exclamation
43:09 - points so that's the file that we're
43:14 - gonna start editing first and at this
43:22 - point what we want to do is I guess we
43:29 - should set up our argot let's set up get
43:33 - first because I want you all to be able
43:34 - to see all this code normally I'd
43:36 - actually wait a little while to set up
43:38 - get because I do so like some just basic
43:41 - stuff to set up the project but in this
43:45 - case I think it would be better if you
43:47 - all could see and interact with all of
43:49 - the code so let's do that now so we're
43:53 - gonna do get in it
43:55 - and that's gonna make this a git repo
44:02 - all right so now let's do git commit let
44:10 - me let me do status just to show you all
44:14 - right so we have the skit status so we
44:18 - have these files that are untracked
44:20 - right and notice that these aren't all
44:23 - the files in our project so those ones
44:24 - that were in the get ignore aren't
44:26 - listed here so we're gonna do a git add
44:29 - and I'm gonna press just put a period
44:32 - there and that's gonna add everything
44:33 - and now if we look at our status you can
44:37 - see we have green so now we're ready to
44:38 - go
44:39 - to add all of this so I'm gonna go get
44:41 - commit and I'm just gonna do the EM flag
44:45 - which means I can put the message right
44:47 - here in line for this commit and I'm
44:49 - just gonna say and that this is our
44:52 - initial commit and there we go so now
44:58 - this is a git repo let's set up the repo
45:01 - on github so that you all can see what's
45:03 - going on so I want to go into my github
45:12 - actually we should I'm gonna do this in
45:14 - the github for my for my department so
45:22 - let's go
45:28 - just make a new repository Resource
45:34 - Center okay so we're gonna have a new
45:38 - repo called Resource Center and
45:56 - all right so just a quick description
45:58 - we're gonna make this public there's no
46:00 - reason right now that this should be
46:01 - private there I am gonna have some API
46:04 - keys and things later on that I'm going
46:06 - to need to use but I'm gonna use it
46:08 - server-side and I'll use environment
46:09 - variables that won't get shared in the
46:12 - repo and then that way I can still share
46:14 - all the code without worrying about
46:16 - sharing API keys so when we get to that
46:19 - part I'll hopefully I'm able to do that
46:22 - in a stream because I think that's an
46:24 - important step if you've never done that
46:25 - it's good to know so you don't
46:27 - accidentally share you know keys that
46:30 - that should not be shared so we're not
46:34 - we don't need to read me because we
46:36 - already have one the same thing with the
46:38 - gate ignore we don't you know we don't
46:39 - need one license I'm not really worried
46:42 - about a license right now let's see so
46:48 - let's create this repo alright now we
46:56 - have an existing repository so we want
46:59 - to push that from the command line so
47:03 - we're gonna copy this this git remote
47:05 - add origin alright so basically we're
47:09 - setting up our remote here at this
47:13 - address and then we're just gonna push
47:17 - everything up to github so here's our
47:19 - first command and then here's our second
47:31 - there we go and let's check out the repo
47:37 - alright awesome so here's our repo as I
47:42 - said are the readme has like everything
47:44 - from the create react a premie which
47:47 - we're going to take out at some point
47:49 - but for now that's in there it shows our
47:52 - first commit it shows our code so it's
47:55 - just like our App J s so you can even
47:58 - see where we added the three exclamation
48:00 - points so there you go so now you can
48:04 - you can look at this I'm gonna paste
48:07 - this URL for the repo into the live chat
48:12 - and then I will be putting this in the
48:15 - description for the video for every
48:18 - video so that you all can see it so
48:21 - there it is in the live chat and let me
48:29 - I'm gonna check my timer okay
48:36 - let me move let me move this off and
48:44 - let's bring this in since this is where
48:46 - we're gonna be doing you know we want to
48:48 - see the work so we have to we have to
48:59 - come up with our how we want this layout
49:02 - to be how it's designed to be now we
49:04 - have some brand guidelines that we need
49:06 - to follow we already have how it looks
49:08 - now
49:08 - so we just need to kind of determine
49:12 - well how do you really want this to look
49:14 - also we got to make another decision
49:16 - here and I need your help on this one
49:19 - because I'm I know what probably should
49:23 - be done but I don't know if I'm ready to
49:25 - do it and here's the thing I've used
49:28 - materialised framework for all my CSS
49:33 - but it's based off of jQuery and it's
49:38 - not good to modify the Dom with jQuery
49:41 - when you're using react you want to
49:42 - modify it in the react way preferably
49:46 - using state to rerender things so do I
49:51 - use materialize framework again and just
49:59 - just deal with the fact that I'm gonna
50:01 - have some jQuery do I try to use
50:04 - materialized but don't use any of the
50:06 - parts that use jQuery or do I try to
50:09 - just completely do it from scratch doing
50:14 - it from scratch is going to take a long
50:15 - time it would be cool to try to convert
50:20 - maybe use materialized but then convert
50:22 - some of the stuff that it has I'm not
50:25 - really sure or is there another library
50:27 - that I should just try to use instead I
50:29 - haven't seen a material design react
50:31 - library that I would that I really liked
50:34 - they've always been things about the
50:36 - ones that I've seen that we're kind of
50:38 - like deal breakers for me I didn't want
50:40 - to use it so I'm gonna go to the chat
50:42 - I'm gonna see what you all think about
50:43 - that before I make a decision on this
50:47 - because I mean I'm at the point really
50:48 - where I'm going to start
50:49 - countenance oh if I if I'm going to use
50:52 - a framework I need to know because my
50:55 - markup is going to be based off of that
50:57 - framework
51:13 - alright okay I got a lot of suggestions
51:17 - here let me actually bill said you plan
51:24 - on using tests for this project actually
51:26 - I hadn't even thought of it but that's a
51:28 - great idea I have not used tests very
51:36 - often at all so maybe I should I do want
51:40 - to learn how to do tests so maybe now is
51:43 - the time to start maybe this is the
51:45 - project where I finally do all those
51:47 - things that I know are good ideas but
51:49 - I've always put off because of tight
51:51 - deadlines so we'll see all right so we
51:59 - have material UI so these are some
52:02 - suggestions for alternate to materialize
52:07 - CSS so there's a material you I react
52:12 - materialize ok another suggestion for
52:15 - react materialized bootstrap right look
52:18 - at another suggestion for react
52:20 - materialize Wow okay
52:48 - okay so it seems like if I'm gonna go
52:52 - with the framework the most votes in the
52:55 - live chat go to react materialize so let
53:02 - me bring that up right now so everyone
53:04 - can see what we're talking about
53:11 - let's check it out react materialize let
53:16 - me see
53:17 - looks like I've already gone there
53:21 - alright so this is what we see react
53:27 - materialize alright this is at least
53:32 - this would be consistent I suppose if
53:34 - it's based off of materialized
53:36 - it'd be consistent with what we've done
53:38 - before I'm assuming some of the markup
53:48 - and classes would be the same I'm also
53:53 - assuming that for sure they're not using
53:55 - any jQuery I think it's safe to assume
54:03 - that we'll see okay I need to see let's
54:10 - see what the forms okay not bad
54:22 - I'm liking this so far this would have
54:28 - been helpful in our last project if you
54:31 - remember we had some trouble with our
54:33 - selects okay see how the date picker on
54:43 - nice nice great okay and oh my job was
54:53 - good let's see I want to see if it says
54:56 - for sure that it's not using jQuery this
55:01 - has actually come a lot farther along
55:03 - than when I first looked at it so I'm
55:05 - really impressed with this now I mean
55:08 - maybe I just didn't do a very good job
55:09 - of looking at it all but I thought the
55:14 - last time I checked which has been quite
55:17 - a while that it didn't have nearly this
55:19 - this much so I do want to verify that
55:23 - they are not loading Jake hey folks and
55:28 - it looks like alright jQuery is being
55:32 - loaded
55:38 - let me see if let me check that github
55:43 - page does any Canadian does anybody know
55:46 - for sure how do you use this and does
55:48 - react materialize actually use jQuery or
55:51 - is that being loaded for something else
55:52 - on that page oh it does say alright
55:56 - Carlos I see that thank you
55:58 - I think Carlos answered my question
56:00 - before you even ask that
56:01 - so thanks for being so on top of things
56:04 - all right so we're Lee getting started
56:10 - let's see
56:18 - yeah
56:22 - all right well it looks like I was
56:25 - really really excited about this but
56:26 - this is not what we want what we want is
56:30 - this without the jQuery and I know it's
56:33 - got to be possible right I mean there's
56:36 - nothing special about jQuery that that
56:38 - can't be done in react so yeah we're
56:47 - going to it's going to have to be a note
56:50 - for react materialize I feel really
56:52 - really bad about that because it looks
56:54 - so promising I was actually like have
56:57 - been really considering trying to
56:59 - contribute to this too because I I want
57:03 - to do this as well and I didn't want to
57:05 - just start my own thing if they're
57:06 - already doing this but if that I don't
57:11 - know if they intend to try to make do it
57:13 - without jQuery or not if that's their
57:17 - intention and they need help I'd be
57:19 - happy to try to do that but for now I
57:26 - just don't yeah
57:31 - alright so I'm not going to use that
57:33 - what was try material UI
57:46 - let's see
57:55 - and here's material UI
58:15 - let's see some of the components I'm
58:17 - actually I'm really interested in the
58:18 - form components since we will have a
58:23 - form nice to see text fields okay it
58:30 - looks good let's see how the code looks
58:34 - all right that's pretty clean
58:43 - before I go any further I'm gonna check
58:45 - right away and see what is being loaded
58:49 - these are songs for other stacks yes I
58:59 - cool all right that's good let's um
59:15 - let's see
59:24 - date we I think we do use a date picker
59:27 - okay cool that looks good
59:33 - it's select that's what it's crazy I'm
59:38 - looking everywhere and this is an
59:39 - alphabetical order it shouldn't be that
59:41 - difficult okay that's not that I like
59:45 - that okay
59:54 - I'm liking this so far let's see I'm
60:00 - gonna get a lot really quick to see if
60:02 - someone has contributed some important
60:06 - information before I commit to this but
60:09 - I think this is going to be what we go
60:11 - with okay Greg is asking please say if
60:19 - you're going to start doing tests I'm
60:20 - listening the background I really want
60:22 - to start testing myself I always have
60:23 - issues doing a setup well I guess I
60:26 - probably should start doing tests this
60:28 - is going to be a small project so it's
60:30 - probably better to start with something
60:31 - small so I'm gonna try to start doing
60:33 - tests I can't guarantee that it'll be
60:37 - that helpful to you since I am not that
60:39 - familiar with tests but I'm gonna try
60:40 - try my best to do some tests
60:46 - Josh Arnold this video will be available
60:49 - after after I'm done
60:51 - streaming so the the secondary stream on
60:57 - Instagram is over now you can only
60:58 - stream for an hour so just to let let
61:00 - everyone know in case you are wondering
61:02 - so I did have some some viewers in there
61:05 - this time and so that that will be
61:11 - available for 24 hours in case anyone
61:13 - cares what I look like not sure why you
61:15 - would care but maybe
61:26 - Earl Lewis says isn't jQuery dead no
61:30 - it's not dead you might call it a zombie
61:32 - so it's I think it's more undead like
61:36 - it'll always be around it'll note you
61:38 - can never really get rid of it I don't
61:42 - really have that much of a problem with
61:43 - jQuery it's just when you use jQuery
61:46 - with react then you you mess things up
61:51 - with I don't want to get this wrong I
61:56 - always say the wrong thing help me out
61:57 - everyone its virtual dorm right react
62:02 - has a virtual dome I always accidentally
62:04 - call it a shadow Dom and I don't think
62:06 - that's the right term react has a
62:08 - virtual dome which is like a copy of the
62:10 - the Dom and if you change something in
62:13 - the Dom without doing it the react way
62:17 - then reacts it doesn't have an exact
62:20 - copy of the Dom so it messes things up
62:35 - okay um Maxime asks what's the timer
62:41 - it's a Pomodoro timer so for right now
62:44 - I'm using the Pomodoro timer to help me
62:48 - get an idea of like how long I'm doing
62:51 - things through my normal work I time
62:53 - everything I do with this and I it helps
62:56 - me to break up my work and estimate
62:57 - things better but then during the stream
63:01 - this helps me to remember to stop what
63:04 - I'm doing and go to the live chat and
63:06 - then also to stop looking at the live
63:08 - chat and do my work
63:19 - okay and it looks like reacts we have
63:21 - some people talking about react toolbox
63:23 - now what's reacts okay cool it is
63:29 - virtual Dom so I got it right this time
63:31 - all right let me check out react toolbox
63:34 - since I just had a lot of people talk
63:37 - about react toolbox yeah maxime a anyway
63:45 - yeah the timer
63:46 - it's just tomato timer calm so tomato -
63:49 - timer calm really simple it works for me
63:52 - there are some some ones out there with
63:54 - different features but I don't need all
63:56 - the other features so that one just
63:59 - works fine for me it's right you know
64:00 - right in the browser what am I looking
64:03 - at material I'm just gonna very quickly
64:11 - look at react toolbox because I don't
64:13 - want to spend too much more time on this
64:14 - I mean it's definitely important thing
64:16 - to spend time on because this is going
64:18 - to determine a lot of you know what we
64:20 - do from here on out but yes your view
64:23 - for materials and components hmm
64:39 - okay
64:44 - I like that it looks nice
64:56 - this looks good but do they have it
65:03 - doesn't look like there's a lot of
65:05 - components though but maybe I'm missing
65:11 - something but I'm not seeing like a
65:14 - select
65:25 - all right
65:34 - okay mobbin says material UI has tests
65:37 - and github so i guess that's better
65:42 - material UI is fine let's see on your i
65:52 - guess what are you making how is react
65:54 - useful i'm making basically a website
66:00 - that needs to users can go on there
66:03 - download PDFs and images and then also
66:06 - they can upload files and send
66:10 - information with an online form
66:14 - actually I've actually been meaning to
66:19 - update this with some other cool things
66:20 - I'm not gonna I'm not gonna commit to
66:22 - anything right now but I do have some
66:24 - ideas to make it a bit more interactive
66:27 - particularly like maybe giving users the
66:30 - ability to check on the status of their
66:32 - submissions and possibly even edit them
66:36 - so not 100% sure if I can do that
66:40 - through the right API that's our project
66:43 - management system but I've I've thought
66:47 - that possibly that would be cool to do
66:50 - Oh Sebastian says look at the drop down
66:58 - in react toolbar
67:06 - oh okay so basically the drop down is
67:10 - like the select I see alright since I
67:20 - can't decide here's gonna be the decider
67:22 - whatever project has more stars on
67:24 - github that's the one I'm gonna go with
67:25 - I don't know if that's the best way but
67:27 - I don't have time to do any more
67:30 - research here on the stream so that's
67:33 - what I'm gonna go with so let's check
67:34 - out the github repos for each one I
67:38 - appreciate everyone giving their input
67:41 - so let's see all right so we got 27,000
67:51 - stars and this one has only 6,000 all
67:56 - right so I mean I guess I guess it's
67:59 - pretty it's much different here
68:15 - all right so I guess we're going with
68:16 - material you I my reasoning also behind
68:21 - the number of stars is that probably
68:23 - means more people are using this and
68:25 - there's more like there'll be more stuff
68:28 - on Stack Overflow about it if more
68:31 - people are using it so if I need help I
68:33 - can find it so it's not entirely without
68:36 - a foundation there but assuming that the
68:40 - two frameworks are pretty much you know
68:43 - similar and what they offer I'd rather
68:45 - go with the one that's used by more
68:49 - people just to have that kind of that
68:52 - community that I can go to for
68:54 - information so let's do this let's
68:59 - install material UI now to do we want to
69:04 - do the pre-release
69:15 - I don't know maybe I'll just stick with
69:17 - the stable one
69:28 - okay
69:33 - I wish my so let's do this let's go what
69:36 - was it again I think it's just material
69:38 - you uh yep so let's go yarn add material
69:46 - UI
69:59 - my chef seen this react tap event
70:02 - plug-in I had issues with this before I
70:05 - think someone who watches the these
70:07 - streams asked me to check out an error
70:11 - they were having and it was related to
70:13 - this react tap event plug-in I'm gonna
70:16 - have to go back through maybe like my
70:18 - Twitter messages and see what that was
70:19 - because I don't want this to I don't
70:22 - want this to mess us up as well so I've
70:25 - definitely had this error before and
70:29 - I've figured out some way to fix it I
70:32 - mean it's not an error right now it's
70:34 - just a warning but in the case where I
70:37 - saw it before it was actually messing
70:39 - things up quite a bit so I don't
70:41 - remember who it was though if it's
70:43 - someone watching right now let me know I
70:44 - have otherwise I'll have to look back
70:47 - through so hopefully it won't be an
70:49 - issue
70:52 - it's good good material UI
71:09 - all right so for now everything's going
71:11 - to happen just on the master branch and
71:13 - this isn't even live at all at the point
71:15 - where this goes live then everything
71:16 - will switch over to a development branch
71:18 - if you're doing any like really crazy
71:20 - changes we'll have another branch for
71:22 - that so for now if any of you are
71:26 - interested in submitting any pull
71:28 - requests like you'll want to obviously
71:32 - we only have one branch now so it's I
71:34 - guess it's a no-brainer but just to let
71:37 - you know eventually it'll end up being a
71:39 - dead branch so if anyone's really
71:43 - interested in getting you know some
71:45 - contributions for your github profile
71:48 - I'm definitely open to that right now
71:50 - there's really not much going on but
71:52 - once we get started there'll be some
71:53 - more obvious things ways to contribute
71:56 - so and I don't expect anyone to take
71:59 - time out of their day to contribute to
72:01 - my projects but if you'd like to I do
72:03 - appreciate it all right so let's go to
72:10 - the here's a quick example
72:20 - so I've never used this so I'm gonna
72:22 - have to go through how to use it as well
72:26 - okay here's that react tap event thing
72:37 - okay so we're gonna have to just inject
72:39 - this tap event alright so let me move
72:48 - this over here and we'll look at the
72:50 - code whoops I guess it was I on the
72:54 - break and I've started I can't remember
72:56 - what I was doing alright I guess I'm
73:00 - going to go back to the live chat for
73:01 - five minutes now then since I haven't
73:03 - gone there in a while I don't want to
73:05 - lose all the things at the top of the
73:06 - chat I'm already starting to lose some
73:09 - of it so anyway yeah so for now for the
73:17 - next five minutes I'm gonna be going
73:18 - through live chat stuff get some more
73:24 - new people I see welcome thanks for
73:27 - watching
73:37 - Sushil s are you starting a whole
73:41 - project from scratch
73:42 - yep starting everything from scratch
73:43 - this time ahmad s says first time in
73:47 - here thanks for doing this Jesse you're
73:49 - welcome thanks for watching Shriram says
73:58 - yeah there are lots of new people will
73:59 - be awesome if you can explain from
74:01 - basics if you can okay yeah I'll do I'll
74:04 - do my best to try to explain everything
74:06 - in terms of just the stream in general I
74:09 - think I mentioned this before but I'll
74:11 - mention it again for new people coming
74:14 - in the whole this stream is just me
74:16 - doing my normal work I work at a
74:18 - university I'm a front-end developer so
74:21 - it's not rehearsed beforehand you will
74:22 - see me make a ton of mistakes and
74:25 - together with your input we're gonna
74:29 - build some cool stuff and this is
74:33 - definitely not a tutorial and I'm not
74:35 - claiming that I have the right way to do
74:37 - things either so just realize that I'm
74:41 - learning and learning how to do react
74:43 - and I'm always trying to learn and do
74:44 - new things so it's not going to be like
74:48 - the place to go to get a step-by-step
74:50 - tutorial but it's definitely going to be
74:52 - if you want to know what it's like at
74:55 - least for me day-to-day as a front-end
74:56 - developer then this is a good place to
74:58 - go we've built up a nice community here
75:01 - in the chat so people are very helpful
75:02 - if you have questions feel free to ask
75:05 - them I'll try to get to as many
75:07 - questions as I can
75:08 - you can put questions in the comments
75:10 - too and you can direct message me on
75:11 - Twitter if you like as well I try to get
75:14 - to everybody's questions as soon as I
75:16 - can
75:17 - I think that's it hey that's my normal
75:20 - with the normal stuff that I say so if
75:24 - you're new you should be all caught up
75:25 - then and you know what the stream is all
75:28 - about
75:34 - sort of ask any plan for small react
75:37 - project from scratch yeah it would be
75:40 - cool to do some videos and just do a
75:42 - really really basic project from scratch
75:44 - this is going to end up this is going to
75:46 - be a small project so it's kind of gonna
75:50 - be like that it'd be cool to do a video
75:53 - where I do the entire project start to
75:57 - finish including everything maybe one
76:01 - day I'll do that this is not gonna be it
76:03 - there's nothing any stuff that I do
76:05 - that's I don't stream just because I
76:08 - need to work on this
76:09 - you know while I'm at work and I'm not
76:11 - gonna stream the entire day the RAF says
76:20 - I'm new to programming so I wondered
76:22 - what if you have that's the most
76:23 - important honestly I think if you're
76:29 - starting out the most important thing is
76:31 - just keep keep going don't get
76:34 - discouraged always keep learning so yeah
76:41 - that would be the most important thing
76:43 - like just always keep learning and
76:45 - trying new things if you ever get to the
76:49 - point where you feel satisfied like you
76:50 - don't need to learn any new things then
76:52 - that's a bad thing I think that's that's
76:56 - a sign that you stagnated so anyway and
77:01 - if you're new like feel free to ask any
77:03 - questions anything I'll try to help you
77:06 - out however I can we have some people
77:09 - clubs in from Los Angeles Kevin from
77:13 - Trinidad awesome welcome sport Fitness

77:27 - saying it wasn't he wasn't in there but
77:29 - possibly the way I said it made it seem
77:31 - like that so sorry about that

78:09 - to get into coding will welcome and
78:13 - definitely I'm if you have any questions
78:18 - or anything I'm more than happy to help
78:19 - you there's actually an organization
78:22 - just for veterans that looking to get
78:26 - into coding so if you're interested in
78:28 - that send me a message on twitter the my
78:31 - twitter info is in the description and i
78:35 - can hook you up i met the guy that's in

79:47 - otherwise most people ask me questions
79:49 - on Twitter and that's cool but if you're
79:52 - not really into Twitter and you want
79:53 - something else then that's fine as well
79:55 - I'm also frequently on Instagram
79:59 - Facebook so I do have a snapchat but I
80:03 - don't think that's really the place to
80:05 - get coding advice from so not really on
80:09 - the that often
80:15 - alright so let me go back to this and
80:18 - this will probably be the last see what
80:21 - time it is
80:22 - so I'll do one more Pomodoro session of
80:26 - doing some of the work on this site and
80:28 - then then I'll try to get through as
80:32 - many questions in the live chat as I can
80:42 - let me see let me take I'm going to do a
80:46 - few more questions there at the top of
80:48 - the live chat because I'm afraid that
80:49 - they'll they'll get pushed off if I if I
80:53 - don't look at them now so also if if I
80:58 - don't answer your question in the live
80:59 - chat I'm sorry please put it in the
81:02 - comments for this video or message me on
81:05 - some other social media platform and
81:09 - I'll get to your question because I
81:11 - really do and answer all your questions
81:12 - I just don't always have time in in
81:15 - during the stream me ass how did you
81:18 - work through that site Ming knew okay
81:21 - that must have been must be in regard to
81:25 - the that first site that I showed you
81:29 - all this this site yeah it did it took
81:35 - me a long time to work through that when
81:37 - I was new it was crazy I actually didn't
81:39 - even have a computer for the first
81:41 - couple of days that I worked which was
81:42 - insane because like I'm a web developer
81:46 - how what am I going to do without a
81:47 - computer so once I did get a computer
81:50 - then I just I started to look through it
81:53 - all and I just kept looking at the code
81:56 - I just inspected it in dev tools and
81:59 - kept looking and just messing around and
82:00 - seeing how far I could push it and after
82:05 - a lot of trial and error of doing it
82:06 - like that then I
82:07 - finally got to I got it to what it is
82:10 - now
82:12 - so it did it took a long time and you
82:14 - know the it was it was frustrating it
82:18 - was a bit of a mess but I really really
82:20 - wanted to prove myself and so I I did it
82:26 - it worked and my my boss gave me a ton
82:30 - of time to do it so it was really cool
82:32 - about since I was new just really gave
82:35 - me a lot of freedom and time to figure
82:37 - things up but anyway yeah it was it
82:40 - wasn't exactly fun in terms of the
82:42 - workflow but it was kind of cool just to
82:45 - see how far I could take a platform that
82:48 - was obviously outdated alright so I
82:58 - think I got far enough down on the chat
83:00 - that I won't lose too much and now I can
83:02 - I can do some of this so let's see I
83:09 - guess we can just start into a homepage
83:12 - now
83:23 - and let me bring over where'd I put it
83:27 - got a lot of windows open sorry need to
83:30 - find where I put the example oh I see
83:34 - that it logged me out automatically so
83:36 - that's another wonderful thing about
83:38 - this site is that you frequently get
83:42 - logged out you can't use the back button
83:43 - if you try to use the back button it
83:45 - gives you an error sometimes you can use
83:49 - it but a lot of times like it just gives
83:52 - you an error message so anyway alright
83:55 - so this is what we're going off of like
83:57 - I said I don't have to go with this so
84:01 - just for the basic layout that I think I
84:04 - am gonna keep no matter what is you know
84:06 - I definitely want this side panel I may
84:08 - even go with and always open side panel
84:12 - at least for desktop and the top bar I
84:18 - don't think I'm gonna do this that says
84:20 - you know says the name I probably could
84:23 - do it since everyone yeah I'm not I'm
84:28 - not gonna try to do this so it's not
84:29 - gonna say people's name so that was kind
84:31 - of a fun little feature but definitely
84:33 - not you not at all necessary alright so
84:43 - first things first let's just get this
84:45 - base layout of the header nav and then
84:51 - we'll throw in a footer I don't have one
84:52 - here but we may as well throw in a
84:55 - footer and that'll be a nice start
85:00 - alright so let's go to the code here and
85:04 - that's also on my my other screen let me
85:08 - bring it over on this screen so you all
85:11 - can see what I'm seeing I'm gonna close
85:16 - in the side here and my my code editor I
85:21 - just kind of closed off the the file the
85:27 - pain that has all the files in there
85:29 - just to gain us some space alright so
85:34 - I'm gonna kind of scroll through this
85:36 - just to see if there's anything that I
85:40 - really need to worry about
85:42 - so this usage section seems kind of
85:44 - important so let's just check this out
85:46 - before we do anything okay so seem to be
85:59 - provided
86:09 - okay so it looks like I need a theme and
86:16 - for the theme provider it's an app just
86:22 - so
86:40 - hmm
86:43 - all right I'm not if someone has used
86:46 - material UI before let me know about
86:49 - this but this is what I think it's
86:52 - saying it seems like it's basically
87:00 - saying I need to have any time I use one
87:03 - of the components from there I need to
87:05 - import this this Mui theme provider so
87:08 - can I get away with just importing this
87:11 - in my app j/s or do it will I actually
87:14 - need to import this in every like can I
87:19 - just wrap app in this or what I mean
87:23 - potentially like could I go out to the
87:25 - index jas and wrap app inside of this so
87:31 - I'm gonna I actually want to go back to
87:34 - the page that has the examples because
87:39 - that'll be better to get the visual so
87:40 - let's see if it if it explains it more
87:44 - Wow
87:45 - I guess it does
87:55 - all right so that's a while they're
87:57 - getting started page is really like
87:59 - getting started like what is a single
88:01 - page application right
88:12 - is this the one that says a virgin one
88:16 - is coming
88:24 - why don't we just use this version
88:35 - about that as anyone tried the next the
88:37 - new version I mean if if they're about
88:40 - to come out with version 1 why are we
88:42 - building it with the earlier version
88:44 - that's just a rhetorical question for me
88:47 - it's not it's not your father this is my
88:49 - fault
88:49 - well I should have thought about this
88:52 - yeah let's do that let's let's use this
88:54 - version so material UI next let's do
89:04 - that
89:05 - where's my yeah okay so we're gonna do
89:11 - yarn remove I think removers is what you
89:15 - say a material
89:26 - all right that's important actually I'm
89:29 - kind of glad I did this because if
89:30 - you're using yarn you want to do yarn
89:33 - remove it's not a good idea to go in
89:36 - here into your package.json and actually
89:39 - like delete something from this it's
89:42 - better to use yarn the reason being when
89:44 - you do yarn remove it'll update your
89:47 - yarn lock file you don't want to mess
89:50 - with that manually so always remember to
89:53 - do this through either you are an add or
89:58 - remove and it'll just be it'll work out
90:02 - better like that all right so now we
90:04 - want to do yarn add and we're gonna use
90:07 - material you I and next all right so
90:17 - that's cool
90:17 - III really I like the idea of using the
90:19 - latest stuff anyway I think that's
90:23 - better
90:42 - okay
90:45 - all right so now that we're through with
90:47 - that
90:48 - let's hear I con all right let's install
90:54 - the icons as well so yarn add material
91:05 - UI is a oops material you icons
91:19 - okay
91:24 - all right so now this actually this
91:28 - looks like exactly the same thing that
91:29 - was on the github documentation so not
91:35 - really telling me much
91:44 - all right I'm gonna I did look at the
91:47 - chat again I could see you over like hey
91:49 - you gotta read haha alright so let me
91:54 - let me read at least the bottom of this
91:56 - chat again because okay so bill says the
92:02 - Mui theme provider is only a tap j/s
92:07 - awesome ok so just that really cool
92:09 - Aaron s are you familiar with Redux not
92:12 - yet but I am learning it I will be
92:15 - learning it soon and bill so later on
92:22 - I'd wrap it even around the react router
92:24 - ok that's good to know thank you
92:27 - oh man
92:34 - rich buses there are some missing
92:35 - components in material I've e1 ok I
92:40 - think I'm gonna deal with that I think
92:42 - I'm ok with the missing components and
92:44 - work around that if we need to build out
92:47 - some components on our own
92:49 - I'm I'm kind of I'm cool with that this
92:57 - is not read yeah i wasn't reading the
92:59 - chat ok cool sebastian linked up he put
93:08 - in a link in the chat about which
93:10 - components are actually supported so
93:12 - thank you for that i'll check that out
93:18 - that's the best in says this will suck
93:21 - for him haha ok Aaron says he's lying
93:25 - you can remove dependencies from
93:26 - package.json you just need to run yarn
93:28 - again after you do it ok good to know
93:31 - yeah I am that's cool
93:35 - you can run yarn again so if what I was
93:41 - saying about yarn and not editing
93:44 - package.json is not exactly true so it
93:47 - you just have to run yarn again so if
93:50 - you used to
93:53 - I guess it would be the same way if
93:56 - you're using regular NPM like you can
93:58 - remove it from package.json but it's not
94:00 - actually gonna be removed until you run
94:01 - it again so yeah forget what I just said
94:04 - thanks thanks for calling me out on that
94:07 - errand so as long just remember if you
94:12 - don't use yarn remove and you edit the
94:15 - package.json directly run yarn again
94:32 - all of us is not a good idea to use an
94:35 - alpha version of a framework yeah
94:43 - actually Sebastian the link you sent for
94:46 - some reason is coming up with a blank
94:48 - page for me so off to check that out
94:50 - later
95:00 - this is the one
95:16 - all right it doesn't say all right at
95:19 - this point I just want to build
95:21 - something so if I have to switch back to
95:22 - the other one it should be fine because
95:24 - it seems like the the the mark up at
95:27 - least is somewhat similar I mean at
95:30 - least this part is similar so the first
95:32 - part that I need to do will be similar
95:33 - so let's just do that let's look at let
95:40 - make this a bit bigger as you all can
95:41 - see
95:48 - how it would rest I tried to commit this
95:57 - and I didn't add the files first all
96:07 - right cool
96:08 - get committed there we go
96:27 - all right so where's our app there it is
96:31 - let me see I actually don't want this on
96:35 - my I want to put this at the level of
96:39 - the index I'm gonna copy this and put
96:50 - this in here
96:51 - and we're gonna wrap this
97:06 - all right cool
97:11 - so no errors great and then just double
97:21 - check and make sure I didn't miss
97:22 - something great okay good let's
97:36 - layouts
97:42 - yeah I don't really want I just want
97:44 - components
97:56 - there than that of
98:03 - okay
98:09 - that's what I need terminology is a
98:11 - little bit different than than a
98:12 - materialized framework so I've to get
98:15 - used to that but let's check out what we
98:21 - need to do here we need to import quite
98:28 - a bit
98:45 - we're saying it but more astonishing
99:16 - okay I say terrible idea to use alpha
99:20 - version unless your contributor alright
99:22 - so I'm getting a lot of a lot of advice
99:26 - about not using the Alpha in production
99:32 - all right all right you all have
99:34 - convinced me I'll switch it back
99:36 - I'm not going to switch it back right
99:37 - now because you've already seen me
99:39 - switch it back and forth a couple of
99:40 - times so I will switch it back later on
99:44 - today so you guys you will you all that
99:52 - are giving me advice I totally
99:55 - understand what you're saying and you
99:57 - have convinced me but it did it felt a
99:59 - little bit like I don't know like when
100:03 - you're a kid and you're about to do
100:04 - something that's probably pretty
100:05 - dangerous and like maybe your friends or
100:11 - your parents or somebody you're saying
100:12 - like no no you don't want to do that
100:13 - don't do it so I like I guess I was
100:21 - being silly and wanted to live
100:22 - dangerously alright so I guess I should
100:30 - just double-check really quickly to make
100:34 - sure that the let's make sure that
100:41 - everything is the same in terms of
100:44 - markup since if I'm going to switch it
100:50 - No all right
100:57 - and then you notice MF okay four minutes
101:01 - before I'm going to stop so let's try to
101:02 - do something that's for when let's
101:12 - import this at bar and
101:29 - let's get rid of some of this stuff
101:35 - and then what we call this pepper
101:48 - probably I'm guessing that some of this
101:52 - isn't going to work since these icons I
101:54 - think are different for the newer
101:56 - version but might be able to at least
101:59 - see something nope
102:06 - Oh
102:19 - see
102:37 - I thought it said that the icons were
102:39 - different I should double-check before I
102:42 - remove these icons
102:55 - because it doesn't say anything about
102:56 - the icons so maybe I don't need to worry
103:02 - about it so maybe I can remove it safely
103:13 - oops is it not I thought it was that's
103:17 - what it was called so double check that
103:20 - whoa it's here you okay
103:26 - I guess it's not I didn't have to put
103:29 - that in when I was removing it
103:43 - okay so John says and that says living
103:47 - on the edge Jessie's mantra yeah I'm in
103:52 - a unique position I feel like to where I
103:55 - have like nearly complete freedom to
103:57 - pick what tools I want to use to build
103:59 - sites with and I don't think I'll always
104:03 - have that so I kind of like to take
104:07 - advantage of it to try a lot of new
104:09 - things so that way it's good like a
104:15 - learning opportunity I don't want to
104:17 - build things the same way every single
104:18 - time all right now we're going to add
104:29 - this back in
104:36 - okay wonderful let's see if this work
104:44 - still not working
104:49 - what am I missing
104:58 - Adler okay
105:23 - so we have this header
105:28 - alright it's giving me a header that has
105:30 - a height of zero what did I do wrong
105:43 - okay Aaron says try restarting the
105:46 - server that's a good idea
105:48 - let's give it a restart see what happens
106:00 - it's gonna be kind of rough all right
106:02 - awesome thank you so much Aaron that was
106:04 - great advice it's gonna be a little bit
106:07 - rough starting out because this is a new
106:10 - framework for me I mean I'm I'm really
106:12 - familiar with material design but in
106:14 - terms of this particular framework I
106:18 - have no experience with so I apologize
106:22 - for the slow start here but I'm sure
106:27 - once I get the hang of it it'll be nice
106:29 - it'll be a lot nicer than trying to make
106:31 - all the jQuery stuff work with with
106:35 - react so awesome so that's cool that
106:39 - works and that's probably yep my time is
106:44 - up
106:45 - so anyway if you are just here to watch
106:49 - me do my thing on the screen and set
106:50 - things up then you can you safely leave
106:54 - now because I'm done with that part of
106:56 - it now I'm gonna go through the live
106:58 - chat and try to answer as many questions
106:59 - as I can before I end I would like to
107:02 - end this around 4 and that'll be a 2
107:07 - hour 2 hour livestream which i think is
107:13 - plenty plenty long in terms of extremes
107:17 - so anyway so if you did watch and you
107:23 - need to go now you're not worried about
107:24 - the you know the question answer session
107:26 - thank you so much for watching and
107:28 - thanks for all your help and as I said
107:31 - earlier feel free to ask me any
107:32 - questions on any social media stuff
107:35 - or in the YouTube comments and I'll be
107:38 - happy to you know get back to you as
107:39 - soon as I can I definitely don't
107:41 - consider myself an expert but if you
107:43 - still want my advice in spite of that
107:45 - I'm happy to give it now for everyone
107:51 - that can stick around I'm going to
107:52 - answer some questions I'm going way up
107:55 - to the the top of the live chat
107:57 - so I a lot of the chat is now not
108:01 - available to me anymore but basically
108:04 - everything from around 2:30 p.m. Eastern
108:07 - Time on is still available for me right
108:10 - now so I'm gonna just start there and go
108:12 - down if I didn't get to your question
108:14 - cuz let's say I got pushed off the page
108:16 - I'm really sorry please ask me again in
108:18 - some other forum either in another live
108:21 - chat or in any any social media stuff
108:23 - I've actually I've even had people find
108:26 - my email address and email me so that's
108:28 - cool too if you want to do that I no one
108:32 - has yet found my phone number and called
108:34 - me so I'm waiting I'm sure it'll happen
108:36 - one day
108:40 - okay so nag nag Indra asks I am new what
108:46 - kind of project will you do today how
108:47 - long does it take
108:50 - XANA gave a nice explanation saying I'm
108:54 - refactoring a very old static site and
108:56 - it's probably going to take about three
108:58 - weeks so yeah I'm gonna stream probably
109:01 - around two hours every weekday for the
109:05 - next three weeks or so and I I expect
109:09 - that's what it'll take
109:09 - if I decide to add some extra features
109:13 - then you know might take longer than
109:15 - that but I'm thinking just keeping it
109:17 - with the base features that it has right
109:19 - now I'm guessing about three weeks and
109:21 - that's including like I realize there's
109:24 - probably gonna be times when I can't
109:25 - work on this um enough to spend time and
109:27 - meetings and things like that I know I
109:30 - have some I have to do some interviews
109:32 - we're interviewing for a web developer
109:35 - job here I have some interview scheduled
109:37 - coming up and so there's going to be a
109:41 - lot of other stuff I have to do so if I
109:43 - were dedicating all the time to this I
109:45 - probably could do it in less than three
109:47 - weeks and then there's also the
109:50 - additional you know added extra time in
109:53 - that I'm using create react app instead
109:56 - of next which I'm not as familiar with
109:58 - and now I'm using material UI instead of
110:00 - materialized so I'm gonna have to learn
110:02 - some things as I go also going to
110:06 - attempt to use tests
110:23 - and Lucas says what's up what's up Lucas
110:26 - thanks for joining us
110:33 - Emilio asks does anybody know what this
110:37 - site is going to do like general like
110:39 - crud it's it's not really gonna like do
110:44 - a ton in terms of like interactivity
110:47 - right now the it's just gonna have a
110:51 - basic contact form and I'm not a contact
110:55 - form a project submission form that is
110:58 - gonna have a file upload but I'm not
111:01 - creating a database for that information
111:02 - at least I don't plan on it now it might
111:05 - be cool to do but we'll see how it goes
111:07 - but basically that info is going to go
111:09 - to using an API a REST API it's going to
111:15 - go to our project management system
111:18 - which is rike so that's the plan if I
111:23 - have time it would kind of be cool to
111:25 - hook up some sort of database to this
111:27 - just to have like another place to back
111:30 - things up right now we have the problem
111:31 - that occasionally the files won't go to
111:35 - R I can upload files through the API to
111:38 - write but occasionally it won't work
111:41 - and so it'll come through in the email
111:43 - or the file name but the actual file
111:46 - will never make its way into write so it
111:49 - might not be a bad idea to have another
111:50 - place where I store those so we will be
111:57 - going over how to do file uploads and
111:58 - node which that'll be cool Umberto's
112:03 - says I understood it to be like a
112:05 - service desk that's ticketing system
112:07 - yeah actually it's exactly like that
112:09 - umberto that's a good way to explain it
112:24 - abhishek says i just started studying
112:27 - react from full-stack react book is
112:30 - completing the book with examples enough
112:32 - for getting my first job effects as says
112:36 - no dustin says try and see how it goes
112:42 - so I would say it really depends like
112:50 - getting your first job is going to
112:54 - depend on a lot of different things so
112:55 - it's hard to say whether or not
112:57 - completing you know one book or one
112:59 - course is going to be enough basically
113:01 - to get a job all you have to do is
113:03 - convince someone to hire you so that it
113:06 - helps if you have experience in a good
113:09 - portfolio but really you don't you don't
113:11 - necessarily need that so the more you
113:14 - can do to build up your portfolio then
113:17 - the better chance you'll have it getting
113:18 - a job so if if you're learning a lot
113:21 - with this book and you're doing a lot of
113:23 - things then yeah maybe you could get a
113:26 - job with that I'm not really familiar
113:28 - with the book so I can't say I can't
113:32 - speak like to the content of that book
113:33 - specifically but I do get similar
113:36 - questions occasionally and you know my
113:39 - answer is just you know you you can try
113:44 - to get a job at any point you might get
113:46 - it because you know it really all you
113:50 - have to do is convince somebody that you
113:52 - can do the job so for some people you
113:55 - know they take they study for a really
113:57 - long time before they get a job other
113:59 - people a few months and they get a job
114:01 - and then they have to learn a lot on the
114:04 - job but I wouldn't say like don't feel
114:09 - like you have to complete so many things
114:11 - before you can start looking for a job
114:13 - look for a job while you're learning and
114:17 - if you get it wonderful if not keep
114:19 - learning and keep trying in this
114:21 - industry it's not like you need a
114:23 - certain type of certification which i
114:26 - think is really cool so but I would say
114:30 - as you're going through those examples
114:32 - build up your portfolio actually build
114:35 - do side projects do some freelance stuff
114:37 - do wood
114:38 - you can because that's really important
114:40 - to be able to prove that you can do the
114:42 - work the bill says I went back and
114:46 - listened to the first twenty five
114:47 - minutes of the stream
114:48 - I missed that four times speed caught
114:51 - caught up and the speed differs charring
114:53 - at first I must talk slow enough that
114:57 - that's possible to understand me at four
115:00 - times speed I never thought about doing
115:02 - that that's pretty cool max you may ask
115:08 - about the black github so let me show
115:13 - you my github so the background is black
115:17 - so yeah
115:18 - I kind of don't want to go into again
115:22 - how I got this to work because I've done
115:24 - it a few times before in previous videos
115:26 - but basically there's a github dark
115:30 - theme so if you do a search for github
115:33 - dark you should be able to find all the
115:35 - instructions to do it maybe one day I'll
115:37 - do a video like showing how to do it
115:39 - since a lot of people ask me about it
115:41 - but for now like check out github dark
115:58 - it looks like there's there's been some
116:01 - a bit of discussion about women
116:06 - programmers and men programmers and
116:08 - stuff so I don't know that if I want to
116:11 - read out this whole discussion in the
116:14 - live chat
116:24 - yeah I think I'll probably just get a
116:27 - skip it I don't want to like trigger
116:29 - anybody if you know you came here
116:32 - looking for reactant instead you get a
116:33 - debate on you know gender and coding and
116:38 - stuff so so I'm gonna say I'm just
116:42 - letting you know everybody involved in
116:43 - that discussion I'm not gonna read out
116:45 - the comments not that it's not a good
116:46 - thing to talk about I just don't want to
116:49 - I don't want this stream to get into
116:55 - like debatable topics I just would like
116:58 - it to be a calm place I'd be check ass
117:08 - okay so if I complete the free code camp
117:10 - react challenges then so then can you
117:12 - get a job so I mean I think my answer
117:15 - from before or still suffice is to this
117:17 - to just you know you can get a job when
117:20 - you get to the point where you can
117:21 - convince people you can do the work and
117:23 - it convinced them to hire you
117:25 - so yes free code camp will help you get
117:28 - to that point but it's not a guarantee
117:32 - so just you know you got to do whatever
117:35 - you can to increase your skills you know
117:37 - and try to network to there's other
117:39 - things besides just the programming that
117:41 - can help you get a job being able to
117:42 - network you know having a presence
117:45 - online by your social media and your
117:48 - projects your portfolio that all those
117:50 - things are important
118:12 - okay bill says great about a create
118:16 - react app is built in the Jeff slash
118:19 - enzyme support okay so for testing I
118:22 - should probably start looking into jest
118:24 - then is that I think that's which would
118:27 - bill say in here since create react app
118:29 - already has has that so that's good to
118:33 - know I wasn't exactly sure what testing
118:35 - framework I should start with
118:51 - all right
119:01 - okay Santa said John now that would be
119:03 - oh it's John said to make make your own
119:08 - in terms of CSS frameworks make your own
119:10 - less bulk that would be really cool I do
119:12 - really want to do that one day to make
119:14 - my own framework that basically would
119:18 - fit everything that we use at the
119:19 - University for our brand standards and
119:22 - our style guide and make a framework
119:24 - that other like if we hire people to
119:28 - build websites that they can just use
119:30 - that or if other departments end up
119:32 - having developers that they can use that
119:34 - so that that is actually the end goal
119:36 - for me at some point if I can just build
119:39 - off of work other people have done
119:41 - though that would be cool as well I know
119:44 - it would be more lightweight if I did it
119:46 - myself but I mean there's there's a lot
119:49 - of things that I could just build on
119:52 - that other people have done that I don't
119:53 - necessarily need to redo myself and then
119:56 - Jana
119:57 - kind of rightly says that would be ideal
119:59 - but he only gave it three weeks so yeah
120:00 - that's that's kind of the thing I'm not
120:03 - worried about actually building the UI
120:05 - but in terms of then taking what I've
120:07 - built custom from scratch and then
120:11 - testing it in all different browsers and
120:13 - devices and screen sizes like that's the
120:16 - part that I think is the most difficult
120:19 - when you're trying to build like a CSS
120:22 - framework or something from scratch is
120:24 - that these frameworks that are already
120:25 - there so many people are using them that
120:28 - a lot of those issues have already come
120:29 - up you know from their use and so
120:32 - they've you know they've dealt with
120:34 - issues that I wouldn't even you know
120:37 - know about when I so it's just you know
120:42 - yes it is a little bit more you know
120:44 - possibly a little bloated but you get
120:47 - the benefit of having all the basically
120:50 - all these testers you know for free that
120:53 - did you have all their experience and
120:56 - all the issues that they've worked
120:57 - through so I'll probably end up doing
121:00 - some sort of custom framework but it'll
121:02 - definitely be built off of someone
121:05 - else's potentially I might just end up
121:07 - trying to contribute to one of the
121:09 - material design react frameworks out
121:11 - there
121:12 - and that might be better than trying to
121:14 - do my own just in general for the for
121:17 - the entire community it might be better
121:18 - to not make a new one and instead just
121:21 - try to make an existing one even better
121:50 - all right let me look through here let's
121:52 - say I'm going back through there there
121:54 - were a lot of different suggestions for
121:56 - for frame where CSS frameworks and stuff
121:59 - so I really appreciate all the all the
122:02 - suggestions
122:29 - all right so Ryan asks do you use the
122:31 - Pomodoro Technique when you are working
122:33 - or just during livestreams to answer
122:35 - questions so I think I actually
122:37 - mentioned this earlier so maybe you'd
122:39 - asked that question before I said it but
122:41 - yeah I do use the Pomodoro Technique
122:43 - when I'm working and I find it helpful I
122:48 - should actually add that to the list of
122:50 - stuff that I'm going to do videos on
122:54 - because I've gotten some questions on
122:56 - that too I think that would be useful
122:57 - just to go over the Pao is that two tuna
123:08 - on a switch back end are you using I
123:11 - mean this is this is going to be node
123:15 - everything's going to be in node and in
123:17 - terms of like their terms of databases
123:21 - there's going to be no database prop
123:25 - probably no database we'll see we'll see
123:28 - how it goes but yeah this is going to be
123:31 - reacting no jazz okay about about an
123:40 - hour ago
123:43 - cat has I guess how long this is going
123:46 - to be because it was already 9 p.m. in
123:48 - Europe so I guess it's a little late for
123:51 - that question but usually the streams
123:53 - are around 2 hours long
124:10 - like kayo asks will you make the source
124:15 - code available yes it actually is
124:18 - available now on github it's public
124:20 - it'll be there so you can check it out
124:22 - whenever you want
124:36 - okay so I got some comments about the
124:40 - inject tap event plugin and how to
124:42 - initialize that so cool it says the
124:44 - drawer component doesn't work without it
124:45 - so that explains why the drawer
124:46 - component wasn't working I suppose so
124:49 - thank you for that
124:54 - Nathaniel says I do not know how to use
124:57 - react however I'll be learning soon
124:58 - maybe after I'll do some pull requests
125:00 - that sounds awesome yeah definitely let
125:03 - me know if you need any help at
125:04 - everything with with learning react and
125:06 - then that'd be really cool
125:14 - vk3 ask someone from Macedonia smiley
125:18 - with a smiley face anybody from
125:20 - Macedonia around Vitor says it's love
125:27 - from Portugal awesome thanks for thanks
125:31 - for watching
125:47 - Jack Bennett asks what's a good language
125:49 - to learn I would say JavaScript but I'm
125:54 - biased because that's what I mostly use
125:56 - it entirely depends on what you want to
125:59 - do so if you want to do web development
126:02 - then learn JavaScript that's your best
126:05 - you'll you're for sure going to use
126:07 - JavaScript at some point if you're a web
126:08 - developer you may end up using other
126:11 - languages as well but you wouldn't have
126:13 - to you can build pretty much whatever
126:16 - you want on the web with just JavaScript
126:26 - Nathaniel asked any resources you'd
126:28 - recommend for learning react the react
126:31 - documentation like the official
126:33 - documentation is great if you want to
126:35 - spend money you'd acity has a react
126:37 - course right now that I'm doing and I'm
126:39 - pretty impressed with it so far
126:41 - free code campus good free resources
126:43 - code Academy has a free course so I
126:49 - would check those ones out and then
126:52 - there's a lot of YouTube videos about it
126:53 - as well
126:55 - Maximus is from France awesome I love
127:01 - hearing where everybody's from it it
127:04 - does it never gets old to hear
127:06 - everybody's from it's always really cool
127:08 - every time to hear people from all over
127:10 - the world that are joining in
127:23 - michael says hey just starting up a
127:25 - react project for myself project myself
127:27 - creating a ride share app for a
127:30 - university that also records co2
127:32 - statistics per ride and an aggregate
127:34 - that sounds really really cool so
127:37 - Michael if you're still watching I know
127:39 - that comment was from a while ago if
127:41 - you're still watching I'd love to see
127:44 - that so if you could put either in the
127:47 - live chat or send me a message on
127:50 - Twitter or something like if you have a
127:52 - link to the github github repo for that
127:55 - that would be really cool I'd love to
127:56 - see that Shahriyar from Bangladesh
128:03 - awesome
128:07 - Raunak says it's 1:00 a.m. here heiped
128:10 - awesome
128:33 - on a new rug says I'm from India awesome
128:36 - things going on cool he's just saying
128:41 - that Gregg says what I would love to see
128:49 - you do Trello board when you're all set
128:50 - up yeah I'm gonna make the Trello board
128:52 - public and then I'll put a link in the
128:55 - video description so I'll have the link
128:57 - in all the descriptions for the videos
128:59 - when I'm working on this so my one of my
129:08 - co-workers is logged into the Franciscan
129:12 - University YouTube channel and he
129:14 - occasionally types in silly things into
129:18 - the chat so this time he's typing once I
129:23 - did get a computer huh
129:38 - Raunak says how do you plan what to do
129:42 - first
129:43 - setting up routing directory structure
129:45 - or go feature-wise in a project I have
129:51 - to think about it a little bit to think
129:53 - about how I've done it before because
129:58 - I'm often I usually don't get a chance
130:00 - to have like a nice planning period
130:02 - occasionally like I'm just pulled into
130:04 - projects sometimes that are it's not
130:09 - exactly from scratch so I don't like it
130:17 - kind of does it depends on what the
130:18 - project is
130:19 - sorry I can't my brains just like no not
130:23 - working right now I just can't think of
130:25 - how I normally do that and so I'll have
130:31 - to think more about that and get back to
130:33 - you I would say like in big picture I
130:40 - definitely think about features but then
130:42 - when I actually get down to it I go more
130:44 - by like structure so like you know pages
130:48 - at a time like get the main page layout
130:50 - and then each page so I guess that would
130:55 - be that's kind of how I go about it
131:29 - ah rich rich bob says use angular
131:34 - material I assume your big fun
131:40 - so you're joking they're not sure that
131:44 - would work this pressing amazing says
131:52 - please can you continue this live or
131:54 - maybe record it even if you have to
131:56 - voiceover later I'll probably do some
131:58 - live streaming like in the mornings
132:01 - where I don't really give commentary and
132:03 - I just work when I do those I actually I
132:06 - do them on my own channel so that I
132:08 - don't take up the free code camp channel
132:11 - all day so if you're interested in that
132:15 - if you follow my or subscribe to my
132:19 - channel on YouTube then you'll get a
132:20 - notification when I do that I also
132:22 - usually post on Twitter when I do it too
132:24 - so either way if you see my Twitter
132:29 - notification or whatever you know they
132:32 - know you might be able to see more more
132:35 - of the project
132:48 - alright man there's so much in the live
132:51 - chat I'm really I kind of think there's
132:55 - no way I'm going to get through every
132:57 - question so I'm really sorry about that
133:02 - let's see
133:12 - hey evil that's gone I just saw Eva said
133:15 - hey Jessie what you're doing so and John
133:18 - John B says what are you building so
133:19 - yeah I'm building it react a pretty
133:23 - simple react site you bucha says there's
133:30 - nothing wrong with using a framework
133:31 - that's on the bleeding edge alright
133:33 - thanks you do that I mean yeah it's
133:37 - probably a good idea not to use it in a
133:39 - project that I really need to do for
133:40 - work maybe in a side project I'll try
133:42 - like the really bleeding edge stuff
133:46 - Aaron says programming always starts off
133:49 - slow yeah that's true
133:54 - Luka says if anything you'll be
133:56 - encouraged to contribute to the project
133:57 - yeah that's that's actually good idea so
133:59 - he's saying if you use something that's
134:02 - bleeding edge you know like alpha
134:05 - version or something of a framework then
134:07 - you'll have a lot of encouragement to
134:09 - contribute because you I mean you're
134:11 - likely gonna see a lot of bugs and
134:13 - things so I never thought about that but
134:14 - that is a good point
134:19 - nobody says slow is cool for us
134:21 - beginners even because of you I will
134:24 - start learning react oh that's cool
134:25 - that's really cool
134:27 - ya know d let me let me know how it's
134:31 - going with learning react and if I can
134:32 - help with anything I'm happy to help
134:36 - Aaron says keep on rockin Jesse cool
134:39 - thanks
134:43 - Enoch score says I'm too late again oh
134:46 - sorry sorry you're late you can check
134:48 - the recording I'll probably do tomorrow
134:51 - I'm actually going to do a different
134:52 - time so maybe it might be better for
134:54 - some people I think I'm gonna have to do
134:55 - stream in the morning because I have a
134:59 - meeting at 2:00 p.m. Eastern tomorrow
135:11 - uh-huh Bobby Marvin did you really try
135:18 - to post my my phone number in the live
135:21 - chat you didn't push the last two that's
135:23 - actually my I think that is my work
135:25 - number I'll have to look it up because I
135:27 - don't remember my work I actually don't
135:30 - know my work phone number yeah Marvin I
135:40 - think that is my work number so I kept
135:44 - thinking people would get my cell phone
135:46 - number cuz that's out there as well but
135:48 - yeah you found it I didn't even think
135:50 - about that that obviously my work number
135:53 - is probably online but my cell number is
135:56 - online as well because when I was
135:58 - freelancing I use that as my business
136:00 - number so anyway if anybody really
136:04 - really wants to call me I just I never
136:06 - answer I let everything go to voicemail
136:08 - so if you leave a message I'll get it I
136:10 - just get so many like calls from like
136:14 - spam calls that I just never answered my
136:17 - phone anymore baby says hello new here
136:28 - just wanted to say thanks for doing this
136:29 - when is the next time you'll be doing
136:30 - this welcome and you're welcome thanks
136:36 - for for watching the next time will be
136:38 - tomorrow - probably tomorrow morning
136:42 - augusten says thanks for coding late it
136:44 - was good when is the next session so
136:46 - yeah the same thing probably tomorrow
136:47 - morning John B says how long have you
136:49 - been using react just this year so I
136:58 - probably started building and react in
137:03 - the spring of this year somewhere around
137:07 - there so not not actually that long I
137:13 - think some point last year I tried to do
137:15 - like a hello world app and react but so
137:18 - I don't really count that because that
137:20 - wasn't really seriously trying to learn
137:26 - Aaron says is there a way I could do a
137:29 - stream on free code camp I've been
137:30 - programming for 18 years and love to
137:32 - teach yeah I think that's possible
137:35 - it's not really my call you would need
137:38 - to ask Quincy or or get ahold of Bo
137:42 - so check probably on Twitter it might be
137:46 - the best way to get ahold of Quincy so
137:48 - or you can just tweet at free code camp
137:50 - so he manages both the accounts so check
137:54 - out the free code camp Twitter and maybe
137:56 - send a message and say like hey you know
137:58 - I was checking out Jesse stream I'd like
138:01 - to do something like that and he might
138:04 - be open to it
138:04 - so I can't really guarantee anything but
138:07 - that would be really cool John says is
138:17 - it possible to make the final production
138:19 - JavaScript and CSS assets safe
138:21 - separately for each page in a website
138:23 - even though there are many shared
138:24 - components templating etc yeah I suppose
138:33 - suppose so maybe I'm sure maybe if
138:36 - there's some other people in the
138:37 - watching right now that have more
138:39 - experience with that you could explain
138:40 - it in a better way
138:50 - Martin says is finishing my free code
138:52 - camp friend certificate enough to get
138:54 - first job I'm almost done I have CS
138:55 - degree already but that hasn't been
138:57 - enough
138:58 - honestly Martin if you have a CS degree
139:02 - and you're gonna do the free code camp
139:03 - certificate I mean you're in a good
139:05 - place right there because you know
139:09 - you're gonna have the best of both
139:10 - worlds in terms of you know you have the
139:13 - kind of online and do-it-yourself
139:15 - learning and you have the degree so
139:18 - you're gonna have an advantage in count
139:21 - of those old-school companies that still
139:23 - really value a degree so I would say
139:27 - yeah go for it and it sometimes it can
139:30 - take a long time to get a job I know
139:32 - when I was looking for work after I
139:34 - finished college it took me a long time
139:36 - and the jobs that I eventually got were
139:38 - not really great jobs and then whenever
139:43 - I quit my I whenever I quit teaching I
139:46 - used to be a teacher I was looking for
139:47 - work it took me a while to find work too
139:49 - and I eventually basically just did
139:50 - freelance work actually hold on my wife
139:57 - is calling so she's about to be on the
139:59 - stream hello hey I was gonna leave maybe
140:09 - around 5:30 is that is that cool okay
140:19 - okay okay
140:27 - okay sorry about that but I want this to
140:31 - be realistic about how my normal day is
140:34 - and sometimes I get phone calls
140:58 - okay so DJ says it could be enough to
141:02 - just get the certificate from free code
141:04 - camp to get a job from personal
141:06 - experience I was able to get one without
141:07 - a CS degree after doing the front-end
141:09 - certificate so that's really cool so so
141:12 - DJ saying they were able to get a job
141:17 - with without a CS degree with just the
141:20 - front-end free code camp certificate so
141:22 - that's really awesome congratulations on
141:24 - that that's that's great and it looks
141:32 - like you are given some great advice to
141:35 - Martin there in the live chat so thanks
141:37 - for that and yeah Martin as well some
141:42 - people are talking about like LinkedIn
141:44 - and different social media Martin if you
141:46 - want to follow me on some social media
141:48 - stuff and your that might help like
141:53 - expand your network a bit like on
141:55 - LinkedIn and if you want to like put out
141:58 - a tweet or something saying that you're
141:59 - looking for work I'll be happy to
142:02 - retweet you I don't have a ton of
142:04 - followers on Twitter but most of the
142:07 - people that fall in the are in you know
142:09 - in tech so it would be good you know
142:14 - good get those tweets up to get to get
142:17 - it out to people who might actually be
142:19 - able to hire you or pass it along to
142:21 - somebody
142:31 - okay cool bill and Aaron are both saying
142:34 - yes use Jess for the testing framework
142:37 - cool
142:46 - all right Aaron says I made my own CSS
142:48 - framework for hired comm that's really
142:50 - cool
142:52 - Aaron if you're still with us in the
142:55 - chat how how long did it take you to
142:58 - make the CSS framework and was it was it
143:02 - a difficult process I'm really
143:04 - interested in in that you know because
143:06 - as I said earlier I'd like to at some
143:08 - point
143:11 - jonbi says should I apply if an employer
143:14 - wants five plus years experience when I
143:17 - only have two years of experience I
143:21 - would do it I've applied for jobs where
143:25 - I didn't have the experience that they
143:27 - wanted because you never know usually
143:30 - when people put out job descriptions
143:33 - that's like best-case scenario of what
143:36 - they want but they're willing to take
143:37 - less than that so and if they don't get
143:41 - anybody that meets those requirements
143:43 - sometimes they're more willing to take
143:45 - less than that so it's worth a shot as
143:48 - long as the application process isn't
143:50 - like really difficult then it might be a
143:53 - waste of your time but if it's a pretty
143:55 - simple application process and it only
143:57 - take you in a few minutes or so then I
143:59 - say go for it
144:10 - Martin says I'm already over a year past
144:12 - graduating I should already have a job
144:13 - yeah I mean it can be really tough I
144:16 - would say like I mean finding a job I
144:22 - don't know if I'd say like you know you
144:24 - should or shouldn't already have a job
144:26 - like it just all depends like your
144:28 - location in the job market there there's
144:32 - a lot of factors that go into how easy
144:34 - or difficult it is to get a job so don't
144:36 - get too down on yourself just keep at it
144:39 - keep trying you may have to take a job
144:41 - just that you don't really want just to
144:43 - pay the bills there's no there's nothing
144:45 - wrong with that or like maybe you might
144:48 - want to take a job that is paying you a
144:51 - lot less than you probably you know
144:53 - would want but it'll get you good
144:55 - experience to get the job that you want
144:57 - so I mean there's a lot of you know
145:02 - there's a lot of different factors that
145:03 - go into that but I'd say just keep
145:04 - working keep doing side projects if you
145:07 - can or freelance work do anything you
145:09 - can to build up your portfolio and keep
145:11 - applying you know keep applying to a lot
145:14 - a lot of places and even if you're not
145:16 - exactly qualified you know that's that's
145:22 - the only way I mean at some point it's
145:24 - probably going to work out there's a lot
145:26 - of jobs out there so you just got to
145:27 - keep at it
145:45 - Wesley says try to take advice serious
145:48 - and dare to take risks in life and you
145:50 - will succeed and almost everything you
145:51 - put effort into and thanks for that
145:54 - Wesley yeah I mean definitely uh you
145:58 - know when you're given advice by people
145:59 - especially people that have you know
146:01 - kind of been in they've been there and
146:03 - they've gone through that like yeah I
146:06 - try to learn how you can and yeah taking
146:10 - risk I mean sometimes it does say that
146:13 - it takes going out on a limb like I put
146:16 - my job and ended up on freelance and it
146:20 - was really like I wasn't sure how things
146:22 - were gonna go you know was I gonna be
146:23 - able to pay the bills and stuff and it
146:25 - led me to where I am now
146:27 - you know after it took a couple years
146:30 - you know a couple of years of you know
146:34 - wasn't always easy it was difficult but
146:36 - you know I kept at it and now I'm I'm
146:39 - you know I have a job where I'm happy
146:40 - I'm doing what I really like I make
146:43 - enough to pay the bills so yeah keep at
146:46 - it
146:47 - thanks for that Wesley
146:57 - Martin Martin says actually work Martin
147:05 - said something that's a bit negative
147:07 - towards Wesley's comment I'm not gonna
147:09 - read it out but Martin I will say I mean
147:15 - if you're gonna come on here and ask for
147:17 - advice and people are gonna give you
147:18 - advice like you really probably
147:19 - shouldn't be negative at them you know
147:22 - like they don't owe you any advice
147:25 - they're just kind of trying to do it out
147:27 - of the kindness of their own heart so if
147:29 - you don't think the advice is good just
147:31 - don't take it but I don't think it's
147:35 - really it's really right to be so
147:37 - critical of someone who's just trying to
147:39 - help you out and doesn't really owe you
147:41 - anything
147:44 - also I try to we try to keep the live
147:47 - chat a place where like we're very like
147:49 - non critical of of things like I'm all
147:53 - up for a debate about you know various
147:55 - frameworks and tools and stuff but I
147:57 - don't want any like any like
148:01 - name-calling or like derogatory things
148:03 - being said so you know let's try to keep
148:05 - this a positive place where people can
148:06 - feel free to you know express themselves
148:10 - here give advice ask for advice and
148:13 - things so you know just you know every
148:17 - for everyone you know just keep that in
148:19 - mind
148:54 - yeah I'm gonna read this one out here
149:01 - Martin says here I am getting berated by
149:03 - people who actually got jobs doing the
149:05 - same exact things I've tried when I was
149:07 - unlucky and didn't I mean I would say
149:09 - like I mean I I just read all the
149:14 - comments there Martin so I'm not sure
149:16 - what you mean by being berated
149:18 - everybody's just giving you advice so I
149:21 - know it must be frustrating not to get a
149:23 - job but you know the idea I mean the
149:30 - idea that you're just unlucky and didn't
149:32 - get jobs implies that they got jobs
149:34 - because they were lucky I don't think
149:36 - luck has anything to do with it getting
149:38 - a job is based on you know your skills
149:41 - your effort who you know you know your
149:44 - connections so I mean the people in here
149:46 - you know most likely worked really hard
149:49 - it's not easy so I mean I wouldn't you
149:52 - know don't don't belittle that and don't
149:54 - try to boil it down to like luck or
149:56 - something like you're just gonna get
149:58 - that's not gonna be a helpful outlook
150:00 - you know because then you're like just
150:04 - turn that into something more creative I
150:07 - know it's easier said than done but if
150:10 - you see people around you getting jobs
150:12 - you know you could take it you know two
150:15 - ways or more but you know one way you
150:18 - could take it is you know kind of
150:20 - getting down on yourself saying like
150:22 - what's wrong with me that I can't get a
150:23 - job another way you could take it is
150:25 - like motivation like hey like it's
150:28 - happening for them it's gonna happen for
150:30 - me like I'm gonna work hard I'm gonna
150:31 - ask them for advice see what they did
150:33 - so anyway I'm gonna skip through
150:48 - I'm gonna skip through some of that
150:50 - because the the the debate is kind of
150:52 - getting a little heated there
151:21 - yeah it looks like Martin's kind of
151:24 - still going on with this lucky stuff I
151:26 - will say this like Martin there's no
151:28 - such thing as luck man I mean I'm like
151:33 - there-there is that like Chet it's it's
151:37 - it's not like it's not like these people
151:39 - have some good luck charm to get jobs
151:40 - it's you know there there are steps you
151:46 - take right to do to get job and you keep
151:50 - working at it will some people fail it's
151:53 - possible yes some people will probably
151:55 - fail and not get jobs there are people
151:57 - without jobs it happens but I don't
152:02 - really think it's right to say that all
152:04 - these people in here that have jobs just
152:06 - got lucky
152:07 - I mean that's that's not it's not the
152:11 - case you know you have to do all the
152:14 - work and put in all the effort and even
152:16 - then sometimes it's not enough but that
152:19 - doesn't mean that these people are just
152:21 - lucky and didn't put in the work and it
152:23 - doesn't mean that they didn't you know
152:25 - in a sense earn what they have so I know
152:29 - you're really frustrated on that but
152:31 - yeah just not I'm not like in all the
152:37 - the negativity because once again you
152:40 - know everybody on here is really trying
152:43 - to help and you you ask for the help and
152:46 - they're just only what you asked them to
152:48 - do
153:00 - um let's see Nathaniel said I'd
153:04 - appreciate if you send me some links to
153:05 - react resources on free code camp forums
153:07 - I will moderate on the forums so you
153:09 - should be able to find my profile easily
153:10 - from the team list I'll see I actually
153:13 - want to do a video on that as and so
153:16 - maybe I'll I might do a video on that if
153:20 - I get a chance soon so um I don't know
153:24 - if I'll get a chance to just put them on
153:25 - there if you the best thing to do would
153:28 - would be either put it as a comment on
153:30 - this video or send it to me and unlike
153:32 - Twitter basically that same request so I
153:35 - don't forget about it and then I'll try
153:38 - to do it one asked about the project
153:45 - being in github it is it's in github now
153:47 - but there's not really much to it
154:03 - she vomits how is angular vs. react in
154:06 - terms of performance Co I'm not really
154:08 - sure I can answer that because I'm not
154:10 - nearly as familiar with angular as I am
154:13 - with react all I can say is that I've
154:15 - been very happy with react so far what
154:18 - I'm using it but that's not really
154:20 - enough to answer that question properly
154:22 - so I apologize but I I'm not going to
154:24 - try to you know talk through an answer
154:26 - when I I'm really just not confident in
154:28 - my knowledge of angular to give a good
154:30 - answer
154:38 - Victor us can javascript be used for
154:41 - making simple offline applications - I
154:43 - often have the idea an idea for a tiny
154:46 - thing I want to make and from Denmark
154:49 - yeah you can you can build offline
154:52 - applications with JavaScript so if
154:54 - you're like with react you can build web
154:57 - apps but you can also build apps that
154:59 - will work on a desktop you can build
155:02 - apps that will run on on mobile phones
155:04 - so JavaScript is very versatile in terms
155:08 - of what it can do
155:17 - Evos says in regard to the performance
155:20 - issue between react and angular says I
155:24 - think a lot of the performance talks can
155:27 - be skipped the performance only really
155:29 - matters when you need fast rendering
155:30 - application I'm talking over 60 frames
155:33 - per second okay so that's that's cool
155:36 - perspective there yeah and that's
155:40 - probably true I mean really it depends
155:42 - on what you're doing but for most sites
155:44 - and web apps the difference between one
155:49 - framework another in terms of
155:50 - performance probably won't even be
155:52 - noticeable to the average user it like I
155:55 - said depending on what you're doing
155:57 - it may not be noticeable
156:20 - all right I'm kind of trying to skip
156:22 - through okay I miss Santa saying goodbye
156:29 - I always miss her saying goodbyes
156:34 - let's see I'm going to try to skip
156:40 - through a lot of this stuff and
156:48 - [Music]
156:56 - just get to some questions Martinez who
157:01 - says it's really be motivating to watch
157:02 - the stream like this where everybody
157:03 - already has a job as jobs or internships
157:05 - why would you be watching this if you
157:07 - are you're a pro right programming job
157:09 - actually there are a lot of people that
157:12 - don't have jobs yet they watch this and
157:13 - I've already had at least two people
157:15 - that started watching when they didn't
157:17 - have a job and then have gotten jobs
157:20 - since then so it's definitely a mix a
157:23 - lot of the people that are actually
157:25 - contributing to the chat do have jobs
157:28 - and that's so that's why probably seems
157:32 - like most people have the jobs but it
157:33 - just so happens the people of jobs
157:35 - usually have the most experience so
157:36 - they're able to contribute the most in
157:38 - the live chat but definitely I
157:43 - definitely do have a mix of people and
157:45 - we have people of a variety of Ages all
157:48 - over the world and are all skill levels
157:50 - - I frequently have people come on here
157:53 - and say like hey I just literally I've
157:55 - had people say I just started learning
157:56 - to programming yesterday so definitely
158:01 - different you know all different people
158:07 - for instance Victor just writes thank
158:10 - you guys just getting started with
158:11 - coding and I've heard a lot of good
158:13 - about JavaScript will probably keep
158:15 - going down that route awesome
158:17 - that sounds good Victor and uh you know
158:19 - if you need any help with that or
158:20 - anything you run in any trouble with
158:22 - like just let me know be happy to help
158:25 - if I can
159:07 - oh man she oh I'm said it's a 1:45 a.m.
159:10 - in India and that was that was a little
159:14 - while ago so getting pretty late so
159:17 - everybody from India over there that's
159:19 - for watching really late thanks for
159:21 - staying up and watching Martin says I
159:33 - have almost nothing on my github
159:35 - - but I'm finishing the free code camp
159:37 - certificate right now which is something
159:38 - yeah actually I definitely Martin I
159:42 - definitely recommend trying to fill out
159:44 - your github profile as much as you can
159:47 - because like I know sometimes like when
159:51 - we're hiring people here and I have to
159:52 - look through resumes if someone has a
159:55 - github profile
159:56 - I'm way more interested automatically
159:58 - and then I check their profile and if
160:00 - they have they're actually using and
160:02 - they have stuff on there that's a big
160:03 - plus to me I'm always nervous when
160:06 - somebody applies and they don't give me
160:08 - their github profile I usually try to
160:10 - look it up anyway and if I can't find it
160:12 - I wonder like what but what are they
160:15 - doing you know where's all their code at
160:17 - it doesn't automatically mean that they
160:18 - don't know what they're doing but it's
160:21 - just like I I can't see what they're
160:22 - doing so that's that's a big thing and
160:25 - I've actually heard other people who
160:27 - hire a lot say like if you have a get up
160:30 - profile you're automatically on the top
160:32 - of the pile if you have an active you
160:34 - know github profile and stuff on there
160:36 - so definitely you try to get as much on
160:39 - there as you can and you know side
160:44 - projects if you're doing freelance work
160:46 - you know I would try to put it like in
160:48 - your contracts that that your all your
160:51 - code is yours and you're allowed to put
160:52 - it on github and things like that so
160:54 - that you can get that stuff on there
161:10 - Martin saying all my projects look bad
161:12 - yeah Martin I would say it's better to
161:15 - have something on there than not if a
161:18 - person is hiring they're gonna look at
161:20 - like when I look at somebody's get a
161:21 - profile like if I'm thinking about you
161:24 - know doing an interview or hiring them I
161:27 - don't usually get stuck on like the
161:30 - final product like I want to see the
161:32 - process so even if the end product
161:34 - doesn't look that good if I can go back
161:36 - and see the the process of you know them
161:40 - actually kind of improving things and if
161:43 - I could see like their later projects
161:44 - are actually getting better then that at
161:46 - least shows me that they're teaching
161:49 - themselves and picking up new things and
161:52 - that's really important to me I would
161:54 - rather hire somebody who shows the
161:55 - ability to teach themselves new things
161:58 - you know quickly and improve upon their
162:00 - work then somebody who's like already
162:02 - knows everything right because it even
162:06 - if you know everything now a year from
162:07 - now you know there's gonna be new stuff
162:09 - and it's not going to be you know you're
162:11 - not gonna be at the top of the game
162:12 - anymore but somebody who has that
162:14 - ability to rapidly teach themselves new
162:17 - things and improve they're always going
162:18 - to be on top of things so so I would say
162:22 - I mean you know even if you're not
162:25 - entirely satisfied with the projects it
162:27 - still gives people an idea of your your
162:30 - thought process you know to read your
162:32 - commit messages you know and see what's
162:34 - what's going on now you know and how you
162:36 - work that's that's important
162:43 - Blake says what is Jesse's channel on
162:45 - the link to my channel my youtube
162:49 - channel is in the description to this
162:50 - video is it Jesse it might be Jesse why
162:54 - go
162:56 - Jesse Weigel 29 maybe I don't remember
162:59 - what the the thing is but it's in the
163:02 - description
163:18 - Nathaniel says I'm applying to colleges
163:20 - to get a CS degree in the next four to
163:21 - six years wish me luck yeah good luck
163:30 - Oh Blake asks what is localhost 3000
163:33 - server yeah so I guess you're talking
163:37 - about like this up here the localhost
163:39 - when I run the server locally to work on
163:42 - my site that's what it is it's just a
163:46 - local server port 3000
163:59 - Martin's asking about github and like
164:02 - how to do things free code camp actually
164:04 - has a video series on github and then
164:07 - Udacity has a free course on git and
164:10 - github I definitely recommend those
164:12 - those will be a great introduction to
164:15 - using git and contributing on github
164:18 - because that's that's really important a
164:20 - lot of places want people who know how
164:23 - to use git and so that'd be really kind
164:29 - of a plus to be able to put on your
164:31 - resume
164:47 - okay it looks like Martin left so
164:49 - probably Martin didn't hear some of
164:51 - those later suggestions that I gave
164:53 - which that's kind of stinks but maybe
164:54 - he'll watch the the recording alright
165:00 - let me scroll down I gather this videos
165:04 - already going on way longer than I
165:05 - expected so I'm gonna kind of skip a lot
165:11 - of the comments and just try to go to
165:13 - the questions now
165:14 - Dominic asks what's the value of using
165:16 - react versus just HTML CSS and
165:19 - JavaScript I don't know I don't know let
165:26 - me see if somebody else answered okay it
165:28 - looks like bill answered I remembered
165:30 - this time to check component base
165:34 - reloading is a major value not having to
165:37 - refresh the entire Dom when data updates
165:38 - yes yes
165:42 - Dominic gasps is there any value and
165:44 - learning react over the dotnet framework
165:45 - it just depends on I guess what you want
165:47 - to work on I I don't really enjoy
165:50 - working with the dotnet framework when I
165:52 - have had to work on it now usually I've
165:55 - had to work on like really old things
165:56 - that use dotnet so maybe that's why I
165:58 - didn't enjoy it as much so it just
166:01 - depends on what you want to do you know
166:03 - if you want to stick with all JavaScript
166:05 - stuff then learn react if you want to be
166:06 - you know learn other stuff then you
166:08 - learn net you know if you if you really
166:12 - want to work at a place that uses dotnet
166:14 - and then learned on that
166:24 - Scottie says our tutorial projects good
166:28 - for github if you don't have anything
166:32 - then yeah for sure just it's better it's
166:35 - better to have something than nothing I
166:37 - think a tutorial project at the very
166:39 - least shows that you are learning on
166:41 - your own and and that's that's important
166:44 - that's better than not having anything
166:46 - or just not having a lot let's see John
166:55 - B asks Jessie do you think it's
166:57 - important to study up on data structures
166:58 - for interviews I don't really know I
167:00 - guess it kind of depends on where you're
167:02 - interviewing at what the position is and
167:04 - you know try to figure out as much as
167:06 - you can about the interviews I think if
167:08 - you go on glassdoor.com people will post
167:11 - interview questions that they've gotten
167:13 - there so if you can research and see
167:15 - like you'll probably get a good idea
167:17 - about what questions people have been
167:19 - asked and what's most important to study
167:22 - up on
167:35 - Scottie says should the new guys fear
167:37 - the whiteboard questions I don't know
167:40 - don't be afraid to whiteboard question I
167:41 - mean if you if you do your or your you
167:45 - know do your work these studying get
167:47 - ready then you know don't be afraid of
167:49 - any of that you know the worst that can
167:54 - happen if you go in an interview and you
167:56 - don't do good is you don't get the job
167:58 - you know you go to another interview
167:59 - just you know all you can do is just try
168:02 - to prepare as best you can
168:09 - John B says what do you look for
168:11 - specifically on a potential candidates
168:12 - github profile yeah I I personally I
168:17 - want to see what I want to see like what
168:19 - have they worked on it does that relate
168:23 - to the job that I'm actually hiring them
168:24 - for and then I want to look at like how
168:30 - many like how many commits are they how
168:33 - consistent or the commits like have they
168:39 - contribute if they've contributed to
168:41 - other projects and open-source projects
168:43 - that's a big plus if they've gotten
168:45 - accept because that tells me that the
168:47 - people that are in charge of these
168:50 - open-source projects that are
168:51 - maintaining them have thought that their
168:53 - code was good enough to actually pull in
168:55 - so that that's a big plus that's like a
168:57 - vote of confidence from from people who
169:00 - are established in the industry so
169:02 - that's a big thing if you can get that
169:04 - that would be impressive at least to me
169:06 - and then other than that though just
169:10 - seeing like you know what are you
169:12 - working on or the projects good are you
169:14 - showing improvement in which you're
169:16 - working on things like that
169:30 - Joseph says hi Jesse is it necessary to
169:33 - know something about back-end or server
169:34 - while you learn to be front-end and by
169:37 - the way I'm overwhelmed I'm sorry you're
169:38 - overwhelmed don't get too discouraged
169:41 - about that just keep at it you'll get
169:45 - less and less overwhelmed as you as you
169:47 - go on and get more confident the if
169:51 - you're learning front-end you you don't
169:53 - have to know a lot about back-end it
169:57 - just kind of depends on what you're
169:58 - working on and so I would I would say
170:06 - like if it interests you go ahead and
170:08 - learn back-end but if you feel like you
170:10 - have to learn back-end stuff to be good
170:12 - with front-end stuff I don't think you
170:14 - necessarily do and then if like if you
170:17 - get a job where there's a back-end
170:18 - people and front-end people and stuff
170:20 - and you probably would never have to do
170:22 - very much at all with a back-end but
170:23 - like me with my job we don't have
170:26 - back-end people here so I do have to do
170:28 - some stuff with back-end so I can't say
170:31 - for sure that you'll never need backend
170:32 - because you certainly might but it's not
170:36 - absolutely required
170:57 - one ass or one one says in terms of like
171:04 - the proper talking about free code camp
171:06 - projects in different projects is you
171:08 - can try to build something HTML J's
171:09 - first then try to do the same with react
171:12 - that's actually a really good I've done
171:14 - that I did that with the weather app for
171:17 - free code camp and it was really cool to
171:20 - see the difference in terms of time for
171:22 - development and then the final product
171:24 - so that's really good advice thanks
171:27 - thanks one okay so I am finally at the
171:30 - end of this live chat this was like an
171:32 - epic chat so we had significantly more
171:38 - viewers today than we have and they were
171:40 - really active in the chat so thank you

172:08 - will also schedule the stream so you'll
172:10 - get it'll be on the YouTube channel for
172:12 - free code camp so anyway thanks everyone
