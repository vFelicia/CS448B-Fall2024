00:00 - Hi
00:00 - My name is Chris Gagn√© and I'm an Agile coach
00:04 - Today, I will talk about the Definition of Done
00:08 - The Definition of Done is a documented team agreement
00:13 - It defines the conditions that must be met
00:15 - For a potentially shippable product to be considered
00:18 - Done as in done
00:20 - It's how we know that we did the thing right
00:23 - Meaning we built in the correct level of quality into the product
00:26 - These are different from the acceptance criteria which are written by the product owner
00:30 - And help us know that we did the right thing
00:34 - Creating and following the Definition of Done diligently
00:38 - Can easily double the speed of an Agile team
00:41 - Lean practitioners will tell you that in the long run
00:45 - Quality is free!
00:47 - Because if you don't build a quality product in the short run
00:50 - You're going to pay for it in the long run due to increased technical debt
00:54 - The slow pace of manual testing
00:56 - And production bugs
00:58 - Having lots of hidden undone work in your product
01:01 - Will make releasing your feature to customers
01:04 - Difficult and risky
01:06 - Scrum doesn't talk about this much detail
01:09 - But many less mature teams use two sets of Definition of Done
01:13 - One is targeted at what you will consider done
01:16 - For a single product increment that you are bundling into a release
01:21 - The other is the Definition of Done for that entire release
01:24 - Over time you want to improve your practices
01:28 - Environment
01:29 - And team structure
01:31 - So that you can potentially release any given product increment at any time
01:36 - So what should you include in your Definition of Done?
01:39 - Well at a minimum, you're going to want your work to be
01:42 - Code complete
01:43 - Unit, integration, and performance tested
01:47 - You want to have just enough documentation
01:51 - No new bugs or technical debt
01:53 - And lastly accepted by the product owner who is meeting the acceptance criteria
01:58 - I suggest spending an hour as a team to review sample Definitions of Done
02:02 - And craft your own
02:04 - Then review your Definition of Done periodically, so that it fits your team's retrospectives
02:09 - At the beginning, your Definition of Done may have just a few items
02:14 - And as your team
02:15 - And automation matures
02:17 - Expand your Definition of Done
02:20 - To include more scope
