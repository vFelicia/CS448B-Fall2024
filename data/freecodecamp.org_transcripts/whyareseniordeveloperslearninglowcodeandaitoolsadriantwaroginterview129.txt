00:00 - we had like a a brand new son in the
00:02 - world I wasn't sleeping we had a huge
00:04 - mortgage there was so many debts it was
00:06 - a very very stressful time and I was
00:08 - just thinking like one day I have to
00:10 - tell my son like what do I do as a job
00:13 - and I thought well I want to tell him
00:14 - that I followed my passions and I did
00:16 - something I was really excited about and
00:18 - so that's one of the reasons as well
00:20 - that I decided to take the risk leave
00:22 - what I knew for like 10 years of doing
00:24 - it and jump into web that I've never
00:26 - done before
00:29 - [Music]
00:46 - welcome back to the freec Cod Camp
00:48 - podcast I'm Quincy Larson teacher and
00:50 - founder of freecodecamp.org each week
00:53 - we're bringing you Insight from
00:54 - developers Founders and ambitious people
00:56 - getting into Tech and this week we are
00:58 - talking with none of other than Adrien
01:01 - torog developer designer and teacher of
01:05 - some of the most popular courses on
01:07 - using low code tools no code tools AI
01:10 - tools again he's a software engineer
01:13 - who's gone out of his way to learn these
01:14 - new kind of like contemporary power
01:16 - tools and apply them to get things done
01:18 - faster and he's going to be able to
01:19 - share some insight into how he does that
01:22 - Adrien welcome to the podcast hey Quincy
01:26 - uh thanks for having me on I'm really
01:27 - excited to do this cuz I'm working on
01:29 - some really cool stuff so I can't wait
01:31 - to share it but uh yeah let's get into
01:33 - it yeah man well uh you and I have known
01:36 - each other since really like I'm always
01:38 - proud of like scouting the talent as
01:40 - it's emerging you know like I saw very
01:42 - early on like wow this guy the
01:44 - production value of his courses the
01:46 - caliber of his teaching skills and his
01:48 - communication ability and just the charm
01:50 - of your courses like really struck me
01:53 - and so we are proud to have published
01:56 - several of your courses over the years
01:57 - on the Freo Camp YouTube channel and and
02:00 - I am proud to have learned quite a bit
02:01 - from you just like you know reading your
02:04 - articles and watching your videos and
02:05 - stuff
02:06 - so that's I wanted to take an
02:09 - opportunity yeah I wanted to take an
02:11 - opportunity to learn a little bit more
02:12 - about you in like your developer origin
02:15 - story uh I know you have like a computer
02:17 - science degree and everything but so
02:19 - many things about you are very
02:21 - unconventional like the way you approach
02:23 - technology you're you're like the
02:24 - extreme pragmatist in terms of like I
02:27 - just want to get stuff done you like all
02:29 - the talk about out the window all the
02:31 - you know um all the sacred rules are uh
02:34 - you know thrown onto the Altar and like
02:37 - set of
02:38 - Blaze yeah maybe you could talk about
02:41 - just and also another cool thing about
02:44 - you you grew up in Perth right Australia
02:47 - like yeah probably most isolated geog
02:50 - place in the whole world right yeah it's
02:53 - I mean geographically I don't think you
02:54 - could get farther from Silicon
02:56 - Valley yeah it's rough it's rough so got
03:00 - to be on the cloud essentially but uh
03:02 - YouTube's been a great place to be able
03:03 - to connect and meet people like you for
03:05 - example so it's been great yeah man well
03:09 - uh I'm excited to learn a little bit
03:10 - about your kind of developer origin
03:12 - story and how you guys started like do
03:14 - you remember as a kid like your first
03:17 - interactions with computers all right
03:19 - yeah I do um so when I was in Primary
03:24 - School my first uh use of computers was
03:26 - there was only one computer in the
03:28 - entire School and me being myself like I
03:31 - I was always on there using it and
03:33 - playing around in I think it was like uh
03:36 - Doss back then and just trying to like
03:38 - run commands or like unzip things and
03:40 - show them to my classmates so I was
03:42 - already like across all of that and I I
03:45 - I can see myself from a young kid
03:47 - enjoying that and so as I was in uh High
03:50 - School obviously information Tech was
03:52 - like kind of my favorite subject I
03:54 - scored 100% for everything and as I went
03:58 - to high school like that's pretty much
04:00 - what I was doing as well I was just
04:02 - enjoying that kind of stuff going to the
04:03 - library researching about it and at one
04:06 - point I have to design um decide a
04:08 - career path uh cuz I was going to
04:11 - college but my parents actually said
04:14 - don't do programming or web or anything
04:16 - there's no jobs in there it was still
04:18 - early days internet wasn't really that
04:20 - popular and they said I should do
04:21 - security because you know everyone will
04:23 - be all about computer security the money
04:26 - will be there and I was wasn't too sure
04:29 - but I did computer security and computer
04:31 - science at college and so I left webdev
04:35 - on the side and programming on the side
04:39 - and instead of doing the traditional
04:40 - route where people go to college and
04:42 - they learn about it I kind of treated it
04:45 - more like a hobby something I did on the
04:46 - side so like when Wikipedia came out I
04:49 - made my own Wikipedia clone I learned
04:51 - how to like code in PHP and I was
04:53 - learning all those Basics HTML CSS all
04:56 - the way back then like 10 15 years ago
04:59 - and and it was great it was really fun
05:01 - because it wasn't something I was
05:03 - studying it wasn't something I was going
05:05 - to work in cuz I was still learning to
05:07 - do computer science and I slowly pivoted
05:10 - towards it like doing it help desk
05:12 - installing Windows and servers and stuff
05:15 - like that and so web and programming was
05:18 - still always a hobby and I kept playing
05:20 - around with it I I kept learning like
05:22 - the latest JavaScript U methodologies
05:25 - and latest um implementations of esm or
05:29 - whatever it was called back then but um
05:32 - and then B Babel came across as well or
05:34 - Babel I think people call it Babble I
05:37 - was just reading I was just reading
05:38 - because I was an Enthusiast on that I
05:40 - just loved it and I had studied so much
05:44 - of programming that when I was in it and
05:47 - I wasn't enjoying it for um because I
05:50 - had I had graduated by that point and I
05:52 - got into the workplace I was working in
05:54 - it I didn't really like it cuz I was
05:55 - always dealing with problems always
05:57 - trying to like oh my computer doesn't
05:59 - turn on or this doesn't work and people
06:02 - were always grumpy and at one point I
06:04 - left that job cuz I was made redundant
06:07 - and I joined a marketing company when
06:09 - you were made redundant you were like
06:11 - laid off essentially or how does that uh
06:14 - well not really what ended up happening
06:17 - was um there was a downturn in the
06:20 - economy and people were asking for
06:22 - voluntary redundancies and so I asked I
06:26 - had been there for like five or six
06:28 - years already so I asked for a volunt
06:30 - redundancy so I had a bit of a pay um
06:33 - like a bit of a surplus like a safety
06:35 - net of cash there so I could try out
06:37 - webd and I felt like I'm going to have
06:40 - to start at the very beginning because
06:41 - I've got no experience whatsoever I have
06:44 - no idea what I'm doing I've never worked
06:46 - in web dev Dev before and strangely
06:50 - enough the passion of working at as a
06:54 - hobby for so many years actually meant
06:56 - that when I went into doing web dev
06:58 - doing like basic web websites from the
07:00 - ground up just coding them I was kind of
07:04 - good at it and I also still enjoyed
07:07 - doing it it was still like mentally it's
07:09 - like a hobby for me and so I found it
07:12 - amazing and not only that like within
07:16 - half a year of working at that marketing
07:17 - company they asked me to be one of the
07:19 - directors and buy into the company to be
07:21 - a shareholder and own a third of the
07:23 - company which I did like a partner and
07:26 - yeah I I became a partner exactly and so
07:29 - so suddenly this pivot of like swapping
07:32 - from it to web became amazing like I I
07:35 - felt like I was doing what I enjoyed
07:37 - every single day so for me I didn't
07:40 - traditionally study anything it was more
07:43 - like a hobbying hobby kind of thing
07:45 - where I was just following up on the
07:46 - latest news and so yeah I worked in that
07:49 - company for a few years and uh Co
07:52 - happened so when Co happened um I I'm
07:56 - want to stop you there because I just
07:58 - want to unpack some of the things
07:59 - that uh you shared cuz Co like I don't
08:04 - know anybody who made better use of that
08:06 - uh time than you uh and I've talked to a
08:10 - lot of people who were very busy
08:11 - including myself during that period
08:13 - making the most of the lockdowns and of
08:16 - the sudden surge in online like the
08:18 - interest in online learning and things
08:20 - like that uh we were very well
08:22 - positioned when we went into that I want
08:23 - to absolutely talk about that I do want
08:25 - to share a couple quick things about
08:27 - what you just said first of all um it's
08:30 - so cool how you were able to get out of
08:33 - you know it uh internet things and no
08:37 - it's not really internet things that's
08:38 - that's a joke if you've ever seen the IT
08:40 - Crowd I have I
08:42 - have yeah Information Technology like
08:45 - you were able to get out of like that
08:46 - kind of like help desk type uh you know
08:50 - often like looked at as is kind of like
08:53 - the I mean I don't want to slight
08:55 - anybody who's in it currently but many
08:57 - people are probably listening to this
08:58 - wanting to get into actual software
09:00 - development and things like that and and
09:02 - they're familiar with the uh you know
09:04 - the lack of respect that people
09:06 - generally have like you're the guy who
09:07 - fixes my computer do it you know yeah
09:10 - that's how it was really yeah yeah so
09:14 - you you worked you worked doing that for
09:16 - did you say six years uh six years in
09:19 - that company and then two years in
09:22 - Consulting beforehand and then another
09:24 - two years in the schooling system before
09:26 - that so probably like a decade 10 years
09:29 - fixing people's computers basically and
09:31 - setting up networks and stuff like that
09:33 - right did you have any of those
09:34 - certifications like the all of them
09:37 - micros ones and the VMware ones and the
09:40 - um Cisco ones yeah all of those back in
09:42 - the day the mcps and um Cisco asserts
09:45 - and whatnot okay wow so you like you
09:49 - were like a literal it guy so to speak
09:53 - like that I Grew From like to level two
09:55 - network engineer to level three system
09:57 - engineer to the senior Sy engineer yeah
10:00 - I did all of that so it wasn't how
10:03 - accurate go yeah how accurate to your
10:05 - day-to-day life was the show the IT
10:07 - Crowd the the British comedy did you
10:09 - ever watch that yeah yeah yeah I did
10:11 - it's um when you're talking with people
10:14 - it definitely feels like that kind of an
10:16 - experience where like they don't pluck
10:18 - in a cable and that's why something's
10:20 - not working and 90% of problems are
10:22 - fixed when you just turn something on
10:23 - and off even now today my camera wasn't
10:26 - working and so I rebooted my computer
10:28 - and then my camera's working working so
10:31 - it's like that that's so cool so for
10:33 - sure uh uh you talked about dos and I
10:36 - have to share this because I just
10:37 - learned this did you know that dos
10:39 - didn't originally stand for dis
10:41 - operating
10:42 - system okay it was originally called qos
10:47 - when Microsoft bought it and that stood
10:48 - for quick and dirty operating system oh
10:53 - because it was created it was just like
10:54 - thrown together very quickly and of
10:55 - course it became like this integral part
10:58 - of like
10:59 - you know I guess personal computers in
11:03 - general like pretty much every computer
11:04 - who that had Windows which was built on
11:06 - top of Dos but it was originally just
11:07 - some software that Microsoft purchased
11:09 - from this developer solo Dev who just
11:11 - built it because they were in a hurry to
11:13 - get an operating system together it was
11:15 - called quick and dirty dos and they
11:17 - thought we're not going to be able to
11:18 - sell something with dirty to the uh you
11:21 - know Enterprises of the world they don't
11:23 - want dirty software they want of course
11:26 - so they just remove the quick and dirty
11:27 - and they yeah they changed the uh quick
11:31 - and dirty operating system to Disk
11:33 - Operating System just to make it sound
11:35 - very generic kind of IBM like but uh
11:38 - yeah I just learned that and I wanted to
11:39 - share that with uh everybody listening
11:41 - because it's it's kind of a cool story
11:43 - TI but uh your company did like probably
11:46 - one of the dumbest things any company
11:48 - can do and that's basically like hey we
11:51 - don't have enough you know money to keep
11:53 - everybody on the staff if you
11:55 - voluntarily leave we'll give you like a
11:56 - one-time payout or something like that
11:58 - right yeah think about what is going to
12:00 - happen when you do that uh like any
12:02 - managers in the audience are probably
12:03 - like you know their hair is standing up
12:05 - on their arms thinking about like uh any
12:08 - company well this was a big company
12:10 - though it had like hundreds and hundreds
12:11 - of employees if I left it didn't really
12:13 - matter is likely to happen what is
12:15 - likely to happen sorry I hope I'm not
12:16 - interrupting we have a huge time
12:18 - difference between the two of us uh like
12:21 - again you're like as far geographically
12:22 - there's probably at least like you know
12:24 - half a second of latency between you and
12:27 - me right now um so
12:29 - think about what happens when you say
12:32 - hey uh anybody who wants to can leave
12:35 - and you'll get like a onetime payout
12:36 - like who is going to leave your company
12:38 - is it going to be the weakest people on
12:42 - the team who phoned in every day and
12:44 - like they're not going to want to go get
12:46 - on the job market they're not going to
12:47 - be confident in their skills who's going
12:49 - to take the payout and leave the Adrien
12:52 - twarog of the world who are like you
12:54 - know uh 10x developers like rock stars
12:58 - you know whatever you want to call them
12:59 - basically but people who get things done
13:01 - and are like passionate about what
13:04 - they're doing and are constantly
13:05 - expanding their skills and stuff those
13:07 - are the people that are going to walk
13:08 - out the door if you essentially bribe
13:10 - them to leave just so you can reduce
13:12 - your uh your headcount and your payroll
13:13 - and stuff so uh that is like basically
13:16 - the dumbest HR decision you can make
13:18 - like in my opinion as a manager if we
13:21 - ever got in a situation where we needed
13:22 - to do layoffs and you know knock on wood
13:25 - free C Camp's never had to do that and
13:27 - we we've like structured the entire
13:28 - thing like where we just save a ton of
13:30 - money and we keep costs as low as
13:32 - possible so we can keep all our
13:34 - instructional staff all our uh um you
13:37 - know all of our uh engineering team like
13:40 - in place uh but we would never do that
13:44 - we would just have those hard
13:45 - conversations and choose people and let
13:47 - them go because yeah like what your
13:49 - company basically did was they ensured
13:51 - that only the weakest people stay at the
13:53 - company and what happened to that
13:55 - company are they are they still yeah
13:57 - they're a huge organization so like
13:59 - they're a chamber of commerce
14:00 - essentially and so every single business
14:03 - in Perth is pretty much a member of them
14:06 - so they can wether like the Australian
14:08 - chamber like we have American Chamber of
14:10 - Commerce the West Australian Chamber of
14:13 - Commerce ah okay cool well I'm glad
14:16 - they're still around and that this
14:17 - wasn't like a fatal mistake but I do
14:19 - believe just extremely limited knowledge
14:22 - of the situation I think this is always
14:23 - a mistake and if your management ever
14:26 - offers you money to like leave the
14:27 - company you should take that money
14:29 - should run cuz that sign of like uh
14:32 - first of all ineptitude in the
14:33 - management and it's also uh you've got
14:36 - you can absolutely go out and get better
14:37 - opportunities right um so and to add to
14:41 - that story as well it wasn't as easy as
14:43 - I make it sound at that point in time
14:46 - like I had no savings whatsoever um my
14:50 - wife and I had just gave birth to oh my
14:52 - wife gave birth to our son and so we had
14:56 - like a a brand new son in the world I
14:58 - was wasn't sleeping we had a huge
15:00 - mortgage there was so many debts it was
15:02 - a very very stressful time and I was
15:05 - just thinking like one day I have to
15:06 - tell my son like what do I do as a job
15:09 - and I thought well I want to tell him
15:11 - that I followed my passions and I did
15:12 - something I was really excited about and
15:14 - so that's one of the reasons as well
15:16 - that I decided to take the risk leave
15:18 - what I knew for like 10 years of doing
15:20 - it and jump into web that I've never
15:22 - done before so it yeah it was a very
15:25 - tough decision but like I'm really happy
15:26 - I did it yeah you followed your dreams
15:29 - man uh and I I want to like dig in a
15:32 - little bit more into those dreams cuz we
15:34 - just like you know got into your 30s
15:36 - basically very quickly probably uh maybe
15:39 - we can talk about um what those dreams
15:42 - were early on like you uh just inputting
15:45 - commands into Doss being kind of
15:47 - delighted and enthralled by just the
15:50 - most fundamental aspects of working with
15:53 - computers uh what were your dreams do
15:55 - you do you remember so I always like
15:58 - building ideas
15:59 - um whether they were little projects or
16:01 - little startups um I think the very
16:03 - first thing that I couldn't do was get
16:06 - some really cool games that were being
16:07 - released in Japan and so I figured out a
16:10 - way to get a like go to a Japanese
16:14 - website manually translated download
16:16 - their emulator and ROM and then run
16:18 - those games locally at my school
16:20 - computers and I'm like all right I
16:22 - figured out this like really complex
16:23 - solution and these games are still in
16:25 - Japanese but they're still fun to play
16:27 - and then after that I thought when I'm
16:30 - going to high school I wanted to build a
16:32 - little system that keeps all my notes
16:34 - for me basically OTE or one note today
16:38 - and later after that Wikipedia came out
16:40 - as well and then um after that I'm like
16:43 - all right what other ideas can I build
16:45 - so I always was kind of building ideas
16:48 - and I built them in private and
16:50 - sometimes I built the whole thing and I
16:52 - didn't know how to release it sometimes
16:54 - I built half of them but I was always
16:56 - this is the hobby side of things where I
16:58 - always was enjoying that process of
17:00 - creating
17:01 - things and programming let me do
17:04 - that so your passion for games LED you
17:07 - to like find these kind of cool
17:08 - workarounds with emulation and stuff
17:10 - like that uh I'm I'm obviously like like
17:13 - I can tell from your your background by
17:14 - the way I just want to compliment your
17:15 - background that's a real background that
17:17 - is not a green screen uh you can reach
17:20 - out and touch that YouTube uh 100,000
17:23 - subscriber
17:25 - award you can touch that Pikachu
17:29 - yeah that is anybody who's listening to
17:32 - the audio version uh if you get a chance
17:34 - to check out the video version you can
17:35 - see his background but uh you know we we
17:37 - keep this like I intentionally keep the
17:39 - visuals to a minimum here so everybody
17:41 - who's listening to the audio version
17:42 - gets the full basically The Full
17:44 - Experience other than looking at me and
17:45 - whatever video game I've got like one of
17:47 - those three kingdom arcade games uh in
17:50 - the background right going so you don't
17:52 - have to just look at my face you can
17:53 - look at the cool video game in the
17:54 - background if you get tired of looking
17:56 - at my face uh but you've got a really
17:58 - rocking background so
18:00 - um I'm excited to hear that like you
18:03 - were into games early on and that kind
18:05 - of further fueled your passion for
18:08 - technology that is definitely a Common
18:09 - Thread among a lot of the people that we
18:11 - have on the free podcast is uh yeah like
18:15 - that's that I used to say that like the
18:17 - way that like most of the developers I
18:19 - talked to got into software development
18:22 - was through like a passion for games
18:24 - right doing something like uh just
18:26 - learning how to like you know do like a
18:29 - route on um like a like Super Nintendo
18:33 - uh SNES mini or something like that or
18:36 - learning how to uh sideload stuff onto
18:38 - like an Android phone and like be able
18:40 - to have hundreds of thousand of when I
18:41 - was in primary school no sorry High
18:43 - School I bought myself a pal like I
18:45 - worked a day job and bought myself one
18:47 - of the original like touch device Palms
18:49 - that HP released and so like I would
18:51 - load different software on yeah the PD I
18:54 - was like the only person in the entire
18:55 - school with one so that's pretty you
18:59 - they must have thought you were like a
19:00 - drug dealer or
19:01 - something what may expensive consumer
19:04 - electronics thing exactly
19:07 - exactly yeah but but you P you uh
19:10 - prioritize getting these kinds of tools
19:12 - because you enjoy technology exactly so
19:15 - even now like I love down um grabbing
19:18 - like the latest Oculus Rift or VR and
19:20 - seeing like how can I play around with
19:22 - it what can I do inside of there that
19:23 - isn't otherwise available um I like
19:27 - playing around with Raspberry Pi is or
19:29 - even just getting a projector and seeing
19:30 - if I can like connect up the Raspberry
19:32 - Pi to a projector and then just like run
19:34 - it on a solar panel or something like
19:35 - that it's just fun putting different
19:37 - ideas together like that so you have
19:40 - kind of like a
19:41 - recombinative uh approach to like
19:43 - technology like taking a bunch of
19:45 - off-the-shelf things like almost modules
19:47 - and putting them together and uh we're
19:50 - going to talk a lot about that during
19:51 - this interview because you are a huge
19:54 - staunch advocate of using like low code
19:56 - tools no code tools AI tools to get
20:00 - things done and kind of like glue your
20:02 - custom code together or your custom code
20:04 - is rather gluing these powerful tools
20:07 - together um and building applications
20:09 - but it's like you're you're playing with
20:11 - power tools instead of you know Hammers
20:13 - and and saws um and that that is
20:16 - definitely the vibe I've gotten from you
20:17 - and a lot of what I know about lood I've
20:19 - learned from you oh thanks yeah no um
20:23 - look like when I used to so I love
20:26 - drones as well flying drones and
20:28 - everything and so like 5 10 years ago
20:31 - before DJI made prebuilt drones they
20:33 - would just sell you the kit and the
20:35 - flight computer and everything you'd
20:36 - have to Pro I would program my own
20:38 - flight computer connect it up to a
20:40 - controller configure the controller um
20:43 - solder all the components together and
20:45 - then learn to fly it right and so one of
20:48 - the things that I learned Lear early on
20:50 - is I learned a lot by doing that that it
20:52 - was a lot of fun but now it's so much
20:54 - easier when the Drone is built for you
20:55 - and everything set up and so if you
20:58 - think about npm and npm packages that's
21:01 - kind of the same thing they kind of
21:02 - solve problems for you and they're me
21:04 - ready for you to use and one step
21:07 - further from that is like the no code
21:09 - tools and low code tools they're ready
21:11 - for you to use so you don't have to
21:12 - rebuild the same thing from the ground
21:14 - up and that's why I've kind of always
21:16 - been at that bleeding edge of technology
21:19 - so whether it was back in the day like
21:21 - the programming whether it was the low
21:23 - code and whether it is AI now that's
21:25 - kind of like the Horizon I like to be
21:27 - across and the kind of content I like to
21:29 - do as
21:31 - well yeah and uh before we get too much
21:34 - into that like I I do want to talk about
21:36 - a little bit about your career
21:37 - progression after you left it uh again
21:40 - taking a big risk you said you had a
21:42 - mortgage you had a newborn son uh and
21:45 - wife wasn't working either it's just all
21:48 - on my shoulders for the for the salary
21:50 - so it was yeah aough decision entire
21:52 - fam's putting you know putting food on
21:54 - the table was down to you and your
21:57 - ability security if you work at a job
21:59 - for six years you have security there
22:01 - right and if you have a mortgage you
22:03 - know the bank looks at how long you've
22:04 - been working at a job if I just jump
22:06 - jobs to a new job from that job I go
22:11 - into a career I've never gone into so
22:13 - I'm at the very bottom and I take a
22:15 - salary cut where my salary basically
22:17 - gets cut in half from what I was working
22:20 - at so like before I was working on a
22:22 - about 80,000 and I dropped down to
22:26 - 40,000 a year so it was like a huge cut
22:29 - in salary so yeah it was a scary thing
22:31 - to
22:32 - do yeah I can only imagine uh and it
22:37 - sounds like you started at the bottom
22:40 - like can you describe what it was like
22:42 - arriving some guy uh you were probably
22:44 - in your late 20s early 30s at this point
22:46 - like showing up at the developer Bullpen
22:49 - like uh what was that what were those
22:51 - first few months like working as a
22:54 - developer um it was interesting cuz I
22:56 - was coming into this company replacing
22:59 - one of the other developers right and so
23:01 - he would normally spend one month to
23:03 - build a website and then I would come in
23:06 - now and I would build that entire
23:07 - website in a week same kind of website
23:10 - and I'm just like all right why did it
23:11 - take him a month to make it and so it
23:15 - was the very first time I had ever done
23:16 - it working properly in a job so then the
23:19 - next time I built the website built it
23:20 - in 5 days then the next time I build it
23:22 - in 4 days and the other guy was still
23:24 - building it he was now subcontracting
23:26 - for the company cuz he wanted to work
23:27 - somewhere else
23:29 - um he was still taking a month to do it
23:30 - and I was now taking 4 days to do it and
23:33 - so slowly over time I realized that like
23:37 - programming is a bit of a skill if you
23:39 - don't upskill you're always going to
23:42 - stay at the same time um place and I
23:43 - think this guy was set in his ways he
23:46 - wasn't developing his skill sets he was
23:48 - just kind of reusing what he knew and it
23:50 - was taking him a long time whereas I was
23:52 - always upskilling and that upskilling
23:54 - had a huge benefit over time and so
23:57 - that's why I was was a lot further ahead
23:59 - than him even though it was the very
24:01 - first job I ever worked at it was the
24:02 - very first few websites I have ever ever
24:04 - created just my hobbying and learning
24:07 - and always staying up to um base with
24:10 - what's happening in programming had me
24:13 - further ahead than him who had been
24:14 - working in it for 10
24:16 - years yeah wow and it sounds like uh you
24:21 - you very much have like a growth mindset
24:23 - so to speak and uh you just proactively
24:25 - are out there absorbing I mean you use
24:27 - the term bleeding Edge earlier uh you
24:29 - like to stay right at at the at the for
24:33 - Forefront it's ahead of The Cutting Edge
24:35 - it's the bleeding edge C things might
24:37 - die or they might come to fruition like
24:40 - I remember when react came out for for
24:43 - the very first time and nobody was using
24:46 - it at all it was like so new that there
24:48 - wasn't even like a a release it was just
24:51 - like a thing on Facebook and I was
24:52 - already using it then and node came out
24:54 - and I'm like all right this is going to
24:56 - you sometimes you can just tell these
24:58 - are going to be the technologies that
25:00 - stay I was already at node at like 0.02
25:03 - or whatever the release was early early
25:05 - on um and yeah building tools with it so
25:09 - it was it was great fun and it just
25:11 - meant that as I saw them progress and as
25:14 - each new change log came in I was
25:16 - reading every single line that was being
25:18 - released every new feature that was
25:20 - there um kind of like how bun is out
25:22 - there now and um Deno like as soon as
25:25 - that got released like I'm always there
25:27 - essentially yeah awesome shout out to
25:30 - the Deno subreddit which I'm the sole
25:33 - moderator of because I it's happened so
25:35 - many times I I may have told this story
25:37 - before like some new technology comes
25:39 - out and some big Corporation comes in
25:41 - and like squats the subreddit
25:43 - essentially so I was like I'll show them
25:45 - I'm going to get the D subredit so that
25:47 - no no bad actor can get it I I should
25:50 - probably do that more frequently when
25:51 - they announce new technologies go find
25:53 - the and I mean it wasn't just like I
25:55 - didn't just go and like oh I'd like the
25:56 - dental sub like any four character
25:58 - combination or something like that is
25:59 - probably going to be taken I had to go
26:00 - through this lengthy process with like
26:02 - the Reddit you know overlords to get it
26:04 - but I was able to get it um getting a
26:07 - domain essentially our nonprofits I have
26:09 - that one although I haven't really done
26:11 - anything with it uh because there most
26:12 - people just use r nonprofit but um sorry
26:16 - total tangent but so what you're saying
26:20 - is it's almost like you're you're like
26:22 - the venture capitalist of learning in
26:24 - terms of you know you're taking risky
26:27 - speculative you you're investing risky
26:30 - speculative amounts of time in learning
26:32 - these new tools which may or may not
26:34 - become mainstream uh you know for every
26:37 - for every uh nodejs there are like you
26:40 - know 20 different technologies that just
26:43 - like do you remember you know gulp well
26:45 - guess guess who yeah I do I was using
26:47 - that and guess who was using open AI two
26:50 - years before chat GPT came out this guy
26:54 - awesome I did use it a little bit with
26:56 - gpt2 uh like the public Edition the the
26:59 - the playground I think they called it
27:01 - back in the day and I was like just but
27:03 - it was a spectacle I wasn't actually
27:04 - using it to do any work I was just like
27:06 - isn't this cool you know but but you
27:09 - were you actually using it to get work
27:10 - done it and I would I would build
27:13 - applications on there for my marketing
27:15 - company to do things like generate ads
27:18 - that now like every company is trying to
27:20 - do that but back then there wasn't the
27:22 - appetite for that and in order to use
27:25 - their API for like one task you had to
27:29 - go through a safety checklist of like 20
27:32 - Questions showing examples and your code
27:34 - to go through andove the use of
27:37 - something that's only 20 tokens 20
27:39 - tokens was the limit which if you think
27:42 - about it that's like one or two
27:45 - sentences yeah was saying back then so
27:48 - limited and you can't have like it
27:49 - doesn't store stuff in memory like what
27:51 - gbt and these newer tools uh like I
27:55 - think Claude can hold like 100,000
27:57 - tokens or something and it's context
27:58 - window uh so you were working with the
28:00 - most primordial primitive versions of
28:03 - these tools and you were still finding
28:05 - ways to use them yeah one of the cool
28:07 - ideas I had was um and this is something
28:09 - I built out and then sold was a micro
28:12 - auto complete and so because the context
28:15 - window was so small what I would do is I
28:17 - would grab the last um five paragraphs
28:20 - you wrote and then it would guess the
28:22 - next two words you're right and so it's
28:24 - almost like the auto complete you have
28:26 - in vs code but because it's only um
28:28 - guessing the next two words you have
28:30 - it's really quick it's like when you go
28:31 - on Gmail sometimes and you go hello and
28:34 - it just fill out hello you know Quincy
28:36 - and sometimes just fills out those two
28:38 - words but when you're writing a document
28:40 - sometimes that's useful and you could
28:41 - just hit tab tab tab tab tab tab tab and
28:43 - it wres out a sentence for you so I had
28:45 - to be creative in the ways that I would
28:47 - like utilize open AI back then yeah so
28:51 - getting in early with the tools I I want
28:53 - to get back to your uh your office like
28:55 - how did your bosses react seeing like
28:57 - wow this new kid is really fast at
28:59 - building stuff like what were your first
29:02 - uh how can we make more money for for
29:04 - this right so for them um they thought
29:07 - all right one they can do more sales so
29:10 - their sales pipeline increased but two
29:13 - it unfortunately it meant we can sell
29:16 - websites cheaper now because rather than
29:19 - 40 hours to make a website it only takes
29:22 - Adrian 8 hours to make a website and so
29:25 - instead of charging $10,000 for a webs
29:28 - it now will charge $2,000 for the for a
29:30 - website and so what ended up happening
29:33 - is the company doesn't actually makes
29:34 - more money I just get more busy with
29:37 - more work for the same amount of money
29:39 - and that was one of the issues I had I
29:41 - suppose working at the marketing company
29:43 - like it ended up being just me working a
29:45 - whole lot like I enjoyed programming but
29:48 - I didn't end up making any more money
29:51 - nor did the company make any more money
29:53 - so that's where I started thinking I
29:55 - need to think of other ways to to make
29:58 - money whether it is startup ideas or
30:01 - creative Endeavors or something I I was
30:03 - thinking what can I do and so that was
30:05 - always in the back of my uh mind and I
30:07 - started you know reaching out to friends
30:09 - and trying to see where can I get ideas
30:11 - for doing
30:13 - that yeah so how long were you with this
30:16 - company ultimately uh probably five
30:19 - years where you were now a partner for
30:21 - five years okay yeah so so five years
30:24 - and when do you remember when you left
30:26 - did you leave before the pandemic
30:28 - uh no aftera after um
30:32 - so go on you've got a question that I
30:34 - can hear it yeah yeah yeah like like
30:36 - we're getting we're ramping up to the
30:37 - the main course of the Adrien toog Saga
30:41 - which is the pandemic but uh like so
30:44 - during this time you're you're kind of
30:46 - feeling I mean it sounds like they
30:48 - probably could have found some happy
30:50 - medium between charging $10,000 of or a
30:52 - website in charging 2,000 and maybe it
30:54 - was closer to like 5,000 that the market
30:56 - would have borne I don't know but it it
30:58 - feels like just be you know they should
31:00 - have adjusted the rates to reflect the
31:02 - increased productivity uh that you were
31:05 - doing and were you teaching anybody else
31:07 - or were you like the sole developer at
31:08 - this company so first year I was working
31:10 - with them um and they saw you know I'm a
31:13 - pretty good person to work with second
31:15 - year I became a partner um and I owned a
31:17 - portion of the business third year um we
31:21 - started hiring stuff we grew the team to
31:23 - 10
31:25 - people um then the fourth year the
31:28 - pandemic happened so like the third year
31:30 - I had like I actually hired two or three
31:31 - developers at that point in time so I
31:33 - was actually mentoring people um and
31:36 - then the fourth year Co happened so we
31:38 - had to let go of those stuff because we
31:40 - didn't have the money for it and when Co
31:43 - hit and we're were all working from home
31:46 - and that's when I started
31:49 - YouTube yeah and again as I said earlier
31:52 - like nobody that I know made better use
31:55 - of that time than you did in terms of
31:57 - just establish yourself as a teacher
32:00 - yeah tell me and I decided I watched
32:03 - everyone on YouTube and they're all
32:05 - making tutorials so the way I decided to
32:07 - make my content was how about I show
32:10 - people real websites which I'm working
32:12 - at my company and since I'm director I
32:14 - can you know decide what I'm going to
32:15 - publish or not how about I show them
32:17 - real websites I'm building for clients
32:19 - and they can get an idea of this and
32:21 - I'll also turn them into templates so
32:23 - that they can download themselves and
32:24 - utilize for their own clients and so
32:27 - every every day I was working and every
32:29 - day I was recording myself work and so I
32:32 - had videos every day come out um I think
32:35 - I made about 300 videos in the year of
32:37 - Co which is absolutely insane um but
32:42 - that was pretty much just me every day
32:44 - going to work doing my work recording
32:46 - myself and then collecting whatever the
32:48 - gold nuggets are from that and then
32:50 - publishing it and then I finish my
32:52 - workday and then I'd do the next work
32:54 - day and I'd record myself while I'm
32:55 - doing my work and publish a video so I
32:58 - would not only get my work done but I'd
33:00 - also have video content out there and
33:02 - grow that YouTube channel which was a
33:04 - great time to
33:05 - do yeah man 301 year so basically like
33:11 - pretty much every day uh and and this is
33:12 - while you had you know a youngish child
33:15 - exactly it still meant like I was still
33:18 - doing my um Family responsibility still
33:20 - playing with my son going out to family
33:22 - events and then at the end of the day
33:24 - everyone's asleep at 7:00 p.m. I'm like
33:27 - all right well I've got an hour or two
33:28 - I'm going to record a tutorial and then
33:30 - I'm going to publish it and so even
33:32 - Saturdays and Sundays I would knock
33:34 - those out as well wow and just to let
33:37 - everybody know who's watching this again
33:39 - you're in Perth here in Texas it is 9:46
33:43 - a.m. when we're recording this like what
33:45 - time is it over there uh it's closing
33:47 - into 11:00 p.m. yeah so you it sounds
33:51 - like you're a night ow or you've
33:52 - acclimated to being able to you know
33:54 - work late at night um in a way that most
33:58 - are not able to a lot of coffee but um a
34:01 - r what time do you stop drinking coffee
34:03 - just out of curiosity oh um I usually
34:07 - like to break it up between meals so
34:08 - like one before breakfast one um one
34:12 - after lunch and then one after dinner so
34:15 - interesting so you're like literally
34:16 - drinking coffee after dinner 6 p.m.
34:18 - you're drinking coffee yeah yeah what
34:20 - time do you usually go to bed um around
34:23 - 11: or 12 oh okay so so like we're we're
34:26 - cring up against your your bedtime so
34:28 - you're yeah uh so if I reach to the
34:31 - screen and kind of like shake your
34:32 - shoulder
34:33 - to this is the time for lighting cuz I
34:36 - don't have any sun or anything coming
34:38 - through no harsh lights I can like set
34:39 - up the scene really well for the
34:42 - backdrop and everything like that man
34:43 - your lighting approach is totally
34:44 - different like I'm in front of like big
34:46 - you know Windows basically and I just
34:48 - use all natural lighting uh I don't know
34:51 - I I just like like having through 1 two
34:55 - three four five six seven
34:58 - eight nine 10 10 lights that I control
35:03 - wow so it's like a like a moon landing
35:05 - over there you it looks like a complete
35:09 - mess outside of the frame but inside of
35:11 - the frame it looks
35:13 - great yeah man I also have a fog machine
35:16 - as well to add like a little bit of that
35:18 - Haze in the
35:20 - background yeah really you have you so
35:23 - you're you're actually like adding
35:25 - texture to the background with it also
35:27 - this low Rand the lights which is nice
35:29 - so you'll find that a lot of people that
35:31 - do cinematic scene setups that's they
35:33 - always have a
35:34 - hazer a hazer that sounds like something
35:38 - that only a fraternity would
35:41 - have Okay
35:43 - so let's talk about um let's talk let's
35:47 - talk about like your day-to-day workflow
35:50 - during Co because I mean you establish
35:52 - that at night you're I mean you're
35:53 - drinking coffee all day you're you're
35:55 - doing normal family stuff but you're
35:57 - you're also you know excusing yourself
36:00 - from dinner with your thing of coffee
36:02 - going into your your workshop and you're
36:05 - recording tutorials you're publishing
36:07 - them and you're not just like when you
36:09 - publish on YouTube YouTube is not just
36:11 - like oh I'll just upload the video like
36:13 - you got to do some editing probably you
36:14 - have to like come up with a fun
36:16 - thumbnail uh thumbnail is very important
36:19 - uh you'll see a lot of experimentation
36:20 - with the
36:21 - thumbnails uh on uh YouTube and thanks
36:24 - to Bo KS uh who runs the free cocain
36:27 - YouTube for for coming up with some of
36:29 - these silly thumbnails um but uh yeah
36:33 - the getting people to actually click
36:34 - through and watch your video that's
36:36 - important so originally like everybody
36:39 - starts up uploading and maybe YouTube
36:41 - will throw you like three or five views
36:43 - or something like that right like I
36:44 - frequently watch videos that have like
36:46 - no views that sounds weird but like
36:48 - sometimes I'll be like the first person
36:50 - to watch a video and I'll be like wow
36:52 - it's like so cool it's it's cool to be
36:54 - like in the ground floor but um yeah
36:57 - like like what was your early YouTube
36:59 - growth like so it it's a tricky thing
37:02 - because when I came in it felt like the
37:04 - whole scene was so saturated there are
37:06 - so many people doing content there was
37:08 - like this deved guy which was like funny
37:11 - and this like web def simplified guy
37:13 - with like beautiful hair and like I I'm
37:15 - just like how do I get into this scene
37:18 - and so I thought it was impossible but I
37:20 - thought all right what I'm good at is um
37:23 - like breaking things down and improving
37:26 - them like I'm always at the Forefront of
37:28 - that and so when I made videos say I
37:31 - wanted to do one on CSS animation and I
37:33 - had to do one better than um Kevin um
37:36 - what I would do is the Cs the king of
37:39 - CSS exactly and so I would look at his
37:42 - video like I would search something like
37:44 - U for example CSS animations right I
37:46 - would look at his video I would then
37:48 - have a look at every other video in
37:50 - search I would go through the video and
37:53 - see every topic he covered then I would
37:56 - research CSS animation and I would write
37:58 - up a script that covers everything he
38:01 - did plus extra in a shorter and more
38:04 - succinct amount of time with a better
38:06 - thumbnail and a better title better tags
38:08 - better description more um uh timestamps
38:13 - even though time stamps weren't even a
38:14 - thing back then as well as rather than
38:17 - 1080p which was thing I was already on
38:19 - 4K back then I was like having a look at
38:21 - every single thing I can do to create a
38:24 - video that is better than whatever was
38:27 - ly there on search so whether it was a
38:29 - video about CSS animation whether it was
38:31 - about react and its implementations
38:33 - whether it was about bootstrap every
38:36 - video I researched I had to look at how
38:37 - can I improve on all the videos that are
38:39 - out there and make a better video and
38:41 - that's kind of how I did it every single
38:43 - day day down by day and I tried to
38:45 - improve by 1% every time as well so each
38:48 - time I had a little bit more budget I'd
38:50 - get a better microphone I'd get you know
38:52 - I started off with no backdrop and then
38:54 - I got you know a bookshelf and I filled
38:56 - it out with stuff and I got a better
38:58 - um lighting setup so bit by bit it
39:00 - eventuated to where I am now
39:02 - essentially yeah wow so one thing to
39:05 - note like uh first of all I love the way
39:07 - that you just kind of incrementally
39:09 - upgraded stuff as your budget could
39:11 - provide um and you know you can make
39:13 - money on YouTube which we can talk about
39:15 - in a little bit uh but it's not like you
39:17 - know Scrooge McDuck jumping into the
39:19 - Vault and swimming around in the coins
39:21 - by the way if you actually ever have a
39:23 - vault filled with like gold coins and
39:25 - stuff don't attempt to dive into it
39:29 - um but that might hurt yeah yeah it
39:32 - might hurt might leave it in um so you
39:37 - uh it sounds like you were able to focus
39:40 - on like different production
39:41 - considerations and stuff but it is worth
39:44 - noting that you are a skilled teacher
39:46 - those years you spent at the agency
39:49 - training other developers in different
39:51 - cont you know Concepts and stuff spent
39:54 - in it explaining things right but but
39:56 - like that time it sounds like you did
39:58 - learn a lot about like how to
40:00 - communicate knowledge how to impart
40:02 - knowledge um because no I didn't
40:05 - actually that's that's the thing that I
40:07 - think a lot of people skip out on that
40:09 - that's not where I learned I learned it
40:12 - from watching People's videos as I said
40:14 - and doing the research researching how
40:17 - they're delivering their topics and then
40:18 - also going and researching how um the
40:22 - details are on like CSS animation on
40:25 - different websites and then putting that
40:26 - into a for formula script that has no
40:30 - fluff so like one of the things that I
40:31 - don't do very well on my videos is
40:33 - there's not much personality I don't add
40:35 - many jokes there's not much like um
40:38 - stuff like that it's just pure like
40:41 - what's the pure essence of how I can
40:43 - teach a concept in as little words as
40:47 - possible so you really optimize for
40:49 - tness and uh man you're like the first
40:52 - person I think that's ever actually like
40:54 - said no I'm not a great teacher you know
40:56 - like like has deflected deflected my uh
41:00 - attempt at at uh edifying you uh but but
41:03 - I mean that makes sense so you you
41:04 - really took like a clinical approach to
41:06 - this dissecting what makes things work
41:10 - uh as opposed to like like almost like
41:12 - like uh a Quant might tear apart like a
41:15 - baseball team and figure out like why
41:16 - are we actually losing these games like
41:19 - completely uh like passionless and just
41:22 - very uh well yeah exactly you to have a
41:24 - look like where is the wind resistance
41:26 - coming from the B what's the better Tire
41:28 - you can use how can you make the frame a
41:30 - little bit um less heavy like every bit
41:33 - by bit by bit by bit um because like the
41:35 - cyclist is going to cycle he's going to
41:36 - like move his wheels but it's all the
41:38 - other things that goes behind the scenes
41:40 - that if you're cycling 40 kilm these 1%
41:44 - gains they have a lot of
41:46 - traction interesting so it's a very
41:48 - marginal kind of um approach to
41:52 - gradually just teching up different
41:54 - aspects of your videos I wouldn't say
41:56 - that my videos suddenly made me
41:58 - successful it was definitely a linear
42:00 - path of success that might have had a
42:02 - little bit of a escalation um ju to
42:05 - those 1% but like uh what did they say
42:08 - about interest there was a saying for
42:10 - that I mean it compound over 300 videos
42:13 - a 1% increase is you're going to have
42:15 - the best videos on in the universe if
42:17 - you can actually do 100 1% for 300
42:19 - iterations in a row um yeah that's
42:22 - pretty phenomenal I actually I might be
42:24 - incorrect uh I would have to pull up my
42:26 - uh calculator CU I can't do that sort of
42:28 - stuff in my head figure out like what
42:30 - what is the total Improvement that would
42:33 - be experienced if you were to improve 1%
42:35 - for 300 days ask GPT that real quick I
42:38 - think it's
42:41 - 37.5 times over a year if it's 1% per
42:44 - day
42:45 - MH you would get if you improved 1% each
42:51 - day for 300 days yeah and it's going to
42:54 - do some python here probably so just
42:57 - yeah it shows me the it's just a
42:59 - compound interest formula
43:01 - um yeah and so it's it's calculating it
43:05 - with python I'm just dictating what what
43:07 - GPD is is doing essentially uh it's is
43:11 - 20.99 times the initial amount uh yeah
43:15 - it's pretty good it's like a you know
43:18 - 2,000 and I can see that I can show you
43:20 - like my old videos and you'll see that
43:22 - it's very clear and obvious how much of
43:24 - an improvement that there is and that's
43:26 - why any of my advice to people that want
43:29 - to be creatives and do content on
43:31 - YouTube is do 100 videos it's the same
43:33 - thing Jimmy slm Beast says do 100 videos
43:37 - that'll help you improve the most and
43:38 - then after that figure out what topics
43:40 - you want to do yeah yeah or as I was
43:44 - told uh by the uh writer at Denny's
43:46 - where I was drinking coffee who saw me
43:49 - like working on a draft uh was like
43:51 - throw your first million words away just
43:53 - keep writing and uh it's gonna take time
43:57 - quality takes time and it sounds like uh
43:59 - you you just incrementally improved each
44:02 - facet of these videos and that's how you
44:04 - arrived at your current level of quality
44:07 - which you know when we say current level
44:08 - of quality it's probably still climbing
44:10 - right are you still finding little ways
44:12 - to improve always always yeah so what I
44:16 - like to do go oh go ahead go ahead I
44:19 - still like to research other verticals
44:22 - when I say verticals I mean like
44:23 - channels in say photography or channels
44:26 - in
44:27 - um design or channels in um lifestyle
44:31 - and have a look at like what kind of
44:32 - things are they doing that I can
44:34 - Implement into the coding space to make
44:36 - programming videos a little bit more
44:40 - enjoyable yeah because you're so
44:42 - passionate about programming technology
44:44 - but not everybody's just born trying
44:48 - different commands in Doss right like a
44:49 - lot of people uh they need something to
44:53 - like ignite that passion you need to
44:54 - hold their attention long enough for
44:56 - them to
44:57 - really cultivate an interest in going
44:59 - deeper with
45:01 - technology yeah that's true so it sounds
45:03 - like importing a lot of those uh I mean
45:06 - like there are a lot more accessible
45:08 - Fields than programming You could argue
45:10 - that programming is one of the least
45:11 - accessible fields and that you have to
45:13 - have some baseline understanding of like
45:15 - computer science how computers work
45:17 - probably have to some basic
45:18 - understanding of mathematics you you
45:19 - need to understand like a lot of
45:21 - different concepts before you can really
45:23 - even like attempt to program without
45:26 - just being completely
45:27 - you know befuddled and frustrated right
45:30 - uh so whereas if you show somebody like
45:32 - hey here's a cooking tutorial let's
45:34 - crack the eggs let's you know mix them
45:36 - let's add you know a teaspoon of uh yeah
45:40 - that I can't get into that's that's
45:42 - beyond me you know cooking tutorials but
45:44 - but it is like a physical thing like
45:46 - it's a it's a procedure that probably
45:48 - anybody can watch and like if if you put
45:51 - them in some situation where like you're
45:53 - going to go to jail for 10 years unless
45:54 - you can make me an alet right now here
45:56 - the
45:58 - people could probably do like an OM
46:00 - right whereas if you if you gave
46:02 - somebody the same proposition you're
46:04 - going to uh unless you do rot 13 in the
46:07 - next 20 minutes you're going to go to
46:09 - jail for 10 years like they they would
46:10 - probably you know not be able to do that
46:13 - the typical lay person right just
46:15 - because it it is like it's not a dark
46:17 - art programming is something that can be
46:19 - learned obviously like we're teaching
46:21 - millions of people to learn each month
46:23 - through free Cod camp and you're
46:24 - teaching probably at least hundreds of
46:26 - thousands of people how to use these
46:27 - different tools each month um maybe you
46:29 - can talk a little bit
46:32 - about what it is the you're teaching and
46:35 - what has because I look at your YouTube
46:37 - videos um and you've got some very
46:39 - popular videos like 5 million views um
46:42 - on some of your different project videos
46:44 - and most of your most popular videos are
46:46 - around GPT because you rode that wave
46:48 - and you were like one of the first
46:49 - people you were on the ground floor you
46:51 - were already ready you already
46:52 - understood how to wield these tools when
46:54 - suddenly GPT chat GPT kind of kicked off
46:58 - this chain reaction and got everybody
47:00 - talking about Ai and stuff y so it's the
47:04 - question the
47:05 - question what are your videos about like
47:08 - these days like what are the what would
47:10 - you say the main focus uh if people were
47:12 - like going to your YouTube channel like
47:14 - what would they go there to learn
47:16 - primarily and what are you I had the two
47:18 - channels I've got my Adrian Taro Channel
47:21 - and I like to these days think that
47:23 - that's kind of about programming and AI
47:27 - then I've got a second Channel called
47:28 - codex community and that channel is
47:31 - about
47:32 - design no code and a little bit of AI
47:36 - because AI is pretty much everywhere
47:38 - these days but more about design and no
47:40 - code so it kind of one is more about
47:42 - programmers and one is more about those
47:44 - people that don't want to program but
47:45 - they still want to build
47:47 - websites right so you could like there's
47:50 - this term like Technical and
47:52 - non-technical right like so Semite
47:53 - technical people uh who may know a
47:56 - little bit about coding but don't want
47:58 - to spend all day in vs code like wiring
48:00 - things together they might use low code
48:03 - tools or no code tools or AI Tools in
48:05 - order to get things done instead so
48:07 - codex is kind of like catering toward
48:11 - those people whereas like the main
48:12 - Adrian toog channel is like the the
48:15 - super user like the person who does know
48:17 - how to program and also wants to indeed
48:20 - harvest the utility of these tools I
48:22 - guess like the Adrian twarog one is more
48:25 - also personalized cuz it's me working
48:28 - sometimes on Creative projects I like to
48:30 - work on and so that's why like some of
48:33 - my videos are like me building an RPG as
48:35 - a website so rather than having a
48:37 - fitness tracker or a food tracker you
48:40 - have your life covered as an RPG and you
48:43 - can see your strength and endurance and
48:44 - health and stuff like that I just like
48:46 - to see at like how can I make a creative
48:49 - topic or how can I make a programming
48:51 - thing more interesting than it otherwise
48:54 - is rather than just creating a to-do
48:56 - list cuz
48:57 - you know that doesn't really excite me
48:58 - that
48:59 - much yeah those those standard uh
49:02 - projects that people do like portfolio
49:04 - projects um yeah there's always like a
49:06 - to-do list there's usually some sort of
49:08 - like you know currency exchange
49:11 - calculator like um calorie counter you
49:14 - stuff like that that are they're cool
49:15 - good projects to get you started but you
49:17 - could also do something that nobody's
49:19 - ever done before right uh you you could
49:23 - you can follow your Flights of Fancy and
49:25 - create like uh
49:27 - I I don't know like a Pokedex for
49:31 - um for you know K-Pop singers or
49:34 - something like that you know what
49:36 - whatever wherever your passions like
49:37 - overlap you could you could build
49:39 - something in that space and so you built
49:40 - this it's a pretty cool project uh I
49:42 - watched the video last night just to re
49:44 - refresh I'd seen it before but basically
49:46 - you do build an RPG that like tracks
49:49 - different aspects of of your life that
49:51 - you're you're trying to Monitor and
49:53 - improve and kind of gamifies your actual
49:55 - real life and not just Gam like you
49:57 - might use run keeper or straa or one of
50:00 - those tools to like track your runs or
50:01 - something but this is like an
50:03 - all-encompassing like you are the role
50:05 - playing character and you have stats and
50:07 - you want to buff those stats right
50:10 - exactly it's just a different mindset of
50:12 - like how you track your life rather than
50:15 - just like the traditional way you want
50:16 - to gamify it essentially CU everything
50:18 - that's gamified is a little bit more fun
50:20 - these
50:21 - days yeah and I'm going to link to the
50:23 - video in the show notes but uh the funny
50:25 - thing about that video is like it's one
50:27 - of my most popular videos but it doesn't
50:30 - really teach anyone anything there's no
50:32 - programming in there it's more like a
50:34 - storytelling video I bring people along
50:37 - the Journey of me trying to solve how
50:39 - I'm going to build this thing and I kind
50:42 - of give them the summary of the problems
50:45 - I encountered when I was coding it and
50:47 - then just show them the solution so if
50:49 - you want to learn code you're not going
50:51 - to learn anything from that video but if
50:54 - you're going in there to get some
50:55 - motivation some inspiration
50:57 - to have a look at a cool creative idea
50:59 - and even if you want to download the
51:00 - code and build it up yourself you can
51:02 - jump into the description I've put it on
51:03 - GitHub so you can actually run it up
51:05 - yourself so that's the kind of video I
51:08 - like to make a lot of
51:10 - yeah yeah and one of the cool things
51:12 - about that video in a lot of your videos
51:14 - is you don't just start open up vs code
51:16 - all right let's you know get this you
51:18 - know these libraries in place or
51:20 - anything like that no you start with
51:21 - sketching things out um you you are kind
51:24 - of like a designer at least in how you
51:27 - approach different things and of course
51:28 - you've got like mad design chops which
51:31 - we'll talk about a little bit like
51:32 - you've like published an entire book
51:34 - about design uh but uh you like to
51:38 - actually start out with like paper and
51:40 - pencil or in this video you use like an
51:42 - iPad and like one of those apple pencils
51:44 - that cost like 50 bucks I don't know if
51:46 - they're actually worth it but but like
51:48 - you use that thing and you start like
51:49 - drawing out a UI uh and yeah maybe you
51:53 - can talk a little about your workflow
51:54 - when you approach building a project and
51:56 - do you still start that way do you still
51:58 - start with like a blank canvas and start
52:01 - you know hashing out UI details right
52:04 - there with a pen so um funny enough I
52:07 - still use that same iPad and I still use
52:09 - that same pencil apple pencil and so yes
52:12 - I still do it that way it's one of the
52:14 - ways that I like to create like any idea
52:18 - where I actually just sketch it out like
52:20 - what am I trying to solve how can I
52:22 - brainstorm this what are the key
52:24 - elements and then I can kind of map them
52:26 - map out and then when I map them out I
52:28 - like to then visually map them out so
52:29 - rather than creating a design I just
52:31 - sketch it out like little squares and
52:33 - whatnot to like visualize what will this
52:36 - actually look like when it's working and
52:38 - so that kind of makes the whole process
52:40 - of building it a lot easier it's like
52:42 - saying oh the the recent idea I'm
52:44 - building is a Pokédex it's a Pokédex for
52:47 - real life and so you know Pokemon 20
52:51 - years ago had this cool AI thing that
52:54 - you take a photo of any animal and it
52:56 - tells you what it is with an AI
52:58 - generated voice and it just can use
53:00 - vision and it detect what that thing is
53:03 - and now we have chat GPT so like Pokemon
53:05 - already knew about this thing 20 years
53:07 - ago in the Pokédex and now I'm just
53:09 - thinking how can I build my own Pokedex
53:12 - so a pokedex essentially I can break it
53:14 - down into steps like one is you take a
53:16 - photo number two is you send that photo
53:18 - to an AI and it tells you a description
53:20 - of what that item is three you save that
53:23 - photo in the description four you
53:25 - generate a voice or you use an AI voice
53:28 - model to describe what that is in audio
53:31 - form rather than in just text and then
53:33 - five you like save it to a database and
53:36 - so that's kind of like a Pokedex for
53:38 - real life but it's mapping out those
53:40 - steps and then creating visuals for each
53:42 - one of those steps you can break down a
53:45 - complex problem and just make it happen
53:47 - essentially and it's kind of the mindset
53:49 - I bring towards programming I
53:51 - guess yeah and do you use any like
53:53 - formal system like Universal modeling
53:55 - language uml or anything like that when
53:57 - you're like trying to diagram these
53:58 - things out or how do you uh how do you
54:01 - actually like wire everything together
54:04 - in your mind and on paper before you
54:06 - actually start building do you and do
54:07 - you do all that before you actually
54:09 - start building yeah know I I don't know
54:12 - like I I never learned any of these
54:14 - paradigms or these Frameworks so I just
54:16 - I just brainstorm it out and then I just
54:18 - draw it and then I just build it yeah
54:20 - but um visually like that seems to work
54:22 - really well and I can oh I think my
54:24 - camera's going there there we go
54:27 - um okay like from my point of
54:29 - view from working on early concepts of
54:33 - ideas I've had to working in business to
54:35 - now making content on YouTube that's
54:38 - always worked really well the only one
54:40 - thing I haven't done is worked in large
54:42 - teams of like maybe 50 to 100 developers
54:45 - working on like a huge repo I don't know
54:47 - if you would need some sort of um proper
54:49 - Frameworks in mind for that kind of
54:52 - stuff but for the kind of stuff I'm
54:53 - working on it's always worked perfectly
54:55 - fine
54:57 - yeah and
54:58 - so collaborating with teams in my
55:00 - opinion like that is a completely
55:02 - different skill set than just being like
55:03 - a solo developer and like being your own
55:06 - product manager and uh being your own
55:08 - developer your own designer like you the
55:11 - most efficient number of people to have
55:13 - on a team is always going to be one
55:15 - because there's like none of that
55:16 - communication overhead you don't need to
55:18 - formalize everything the way that it can
55:20 - be Community yeah yeah quick and dirty
55:22 - as you said yeah exactly uh so so like
55:27 - people take for granted like how
55:29 - difficult it is to get an entire team on
55:31 - the same page and convey an idea that
55:34 - like the Visionary person on the team
55:36 - who has this vision for the product like
55:38 - but when you're doing things yourself
55:40 - whatever system works for you works for
55:42 - you right like you don't need to feel
55:44 - like oh damn I don't knowl I'm not a
55:46 - real you know developer if I don't
55:49 - knowl uh because I can't actually do all
55:51 - the fancy like squares and stuff like
55:53 - they do in the movies you know um but
55:55 - but the reality is um yeah whatever
55:59 - works works and it sounds like your you
56:01 - know your brutal pragmatism is on Full
56:03 - display in terms of how you kind of mock
56:06 - these projects up y before building them
56:09 - out and um I'd say the same thing
56:11 - happens to a lot of things in real life
56:13 - um so my wife for example start up a
56:16 - nail salon and so you'd normally for a
56:18 - business to get you know a loan from the
56:20 - bank they want like a business plan and
56:22 - all this stuff and we just did it step
56:24 - by step oh my camera's gone again there
56:27 - s yeah don't worry about okay it's back
56:29 - it's out that's mindset that I have
56:32 - where I'm building a application I said
56:35 - let's do the same for the nail salon
56:37 - let's just map up all right we need a
56:38 - location we need nail stock we need you
56:41 - know some equipment to get it up and
56:42 - running and then we just start
56:44 - advertising and getting people to come
56:46 - in and anything along the way we just
56:47 - buy as we need and so we're able to do
56:50 - that and build a nail salon from scratch
56:53 - so um I'd say a lot of things in life
56:56 - even like when I had my son like there
56:58 - is no plan for that sometimes like you
57:01 - have to kind of learn as you go yeah
57:04 - absolutely like there's no book how to
57:06 - be a great parent I'm sure there are
57:08 - tons of books by way I'm sure there are
57:10 - books for it but but like I mean really
57:13 - it's like an experiential thing it's
57:14 - like there's like there is no book I
57:16 - would have learned to code and and get a
57:18 - developer job except there is that I
57:19 - wrote yay um just Google learn to code
57:22 - book but like that's just my opinion man
57:26 - like like yeah correct in practice
57:29 - there's going to be so many different
57:31 - things so many different like things
57:33 - that are specific to your circumstances
57:34 - and everything like that and they're
57:36 - going to be similar like with building a
57:38 - nail salon or building you know a PO
57:41 - pokeddex for real life uh whatever your
57:43 - project may be you know to some extent
57:46 - you have to rely on your instincts and
57:48 - you have to uh just accept that like hey
57:51 - if I was able to accomplish something
57:53 - there is some validity in how I
57:55 - accomplished it even if looking back it
57:57 - seems like I was just flying by the seat
57:58 - of my pants and had no idea what I was
58:00 - doing the proof is in the pudding right
58:03 - like yeah or the proof the proof of the
58:05 - pudding is in the eating right if the if
58:06 - the pudding is edible you must have done
58:08 - something right right it's not like
58:10 - radioactive you know sludge that is like
58:12 - making people throw up and stuff it's
58:14 - pudding right so you know you kind of
58:17 - have to feel through but but I just want
58:18 - to say like love yourself love respect
58:22 - yourself respect what you've
58:23 - accomplished and don't feel like oh I'm
58:25 - just like a dirty hack who just like you
58:28 - know slaps things together with no Grace
58:30 - or Elegance um you know you'd be amazed
58:34 - at how many of the projects out there
58:36 - are kind of tacked together like
58:38 - famously since we talked about Microsoft
58:40 - and Doss earlier okay yeah have you ever
58:43 - uh have you ever wondered why they jump
58:45 - straight from Windows 8 to Windows 10
58:49 - and why there's no Windows
58:50 - 9 um I thought nine just didn't seem
58:54 - like a good number so they skipped it
58:57 - what I heard was because they had like
59:00 - Windows 95 Windows 98 Windows you know
59:03 - they had like all these different parts
59:05 - of the Microsoft codebase referenced
59:07 - Windows 95 because they didn't imagine
59:09 - like oh we'll just do a full rewrite
59:11 - when we create some future version but
59:12 - no they just keep piling more and more
59:14 - code so if you use like Windows 11 it
59:16 - probably has a whole lot of Windows 95
59:17 - code in there uh that's what I've heard
59:19 - I haven't actually inspected the code
59:20 - base and I don't think it's open source
59:22 - so I don't think I can maybe they've
59:23 - open sourced some of the old versions
59:25 - but um
59:27 - they didn't want to risk having
59:29 - references to Windows 9x because they
59:32 - might have used like regular expressions
59:33 - or any number of things and it would
59:35 - just add all this complexity so like hey
59:37 - I have an idea let's just skip to
59:38 - Windows 10 and uh maybe people won't
59:41 - notice that we skip Windows 9 because we
59:43 - don't want to spend you know developer
59:45 - years hunting through this massive
59:47 - codebase trying to identify all the
59:49 - situations where having a Windows 9
59:51 - could clash with Windows 95 or Windows
59:53 - 98 you know so yeah remember that they
59:56 - said they would yeah I remember they
59:59 - said they would never stop after like
60:00 - they would stop after 10 and there would
60:02 - just be updates after that but then
60:04 - there was 11 and yeah you know but
60:06 - you're right like I think sometimes you
60:08 - don't know what's happening behind the
60:09 - scenes and some things are made with
60:11 - duct tape and sticky tape but they're
60:14 - held together and they somehow work and
60:16 - on the front end everything looks
60:18 - pretty exactly yeah nobody get nobody
60:21 - goes and sees what like how the sausage
60:23 - is made so to speak they just see the uh
60:25 - result in you know if you're not a
60:28 - vegetarian the resulting sauce is just
60:30 - you know very delicious right so
60:32 - um yeah it sounds like to some extent
60:35 - you're just you and your wife are just
60:37 - feeling your way through building this
60:39 - nail salon and you similarly are feeling
60:41 - your way through becoming a prominent
60:43 - YouTube Creator uh becoming a developer
60:47 - uh I mean it sounds like your first day
60:48 - is on the job you know where you were
60:50 - like using all these tools and figuring
60:52 - out all these new things and you know
60:54 - bringing your your own curiosity to the
60:56 - Forefront and applying it to find
60:58 - inventive ways of Saving Time and
60:59 - getting things done faster it sounds
61:01 - like that that you you I mean the vibe I
61:04 - get from you is that you're just you're
61:05 - unashamed of the
61:07 - hackness yeah no I'm not I I think it's
61:11 - part of the process that a lot of people
61:12 - need to see that you know things aren't
61:15 - written perfectly in code every single
61:17 - time and those early videos I did had
61:19 - old the mistakes and how I problem solve
61:21 - those mistakes along the way as well and
61:24 - so I think that was an important an part
61:26 - of it then on top of that I don't think
61:28 - I've ever personally had impostor
61:31 - syndrome cuz I suppose I started at the
61:34 - very bottom and I just I assumed I don't
61:37 - know anything and so I very upfront that
61:40 - I don't know anything and then even when
61:41 - I'm teaching Concepts it's me not
61:44 - knowing about something and discovering
61:45 - it and showing that journey and so for
61:47 - me it's always been a very natural part
61:50 - of how I present I
61:52 - guess yeah and I am similar and that I
61:56 - did have some imposter syndrome but I
61:58 - just assumed like I knew nothing and
62:00 - that like I'm you know some 30-year-old
62:02 - guy who's waiting into this field that
62:04 - people have already been coding for like
62:06 - 20 years because they started when they
62:07 - were kids and they were in like high
62:09 - school programming club and Robotics
62:11 - club and stuff like that and uh I just
62:13 - assumed that I was surrounded by people
62:14 - that were more experienced more capable
62:16 - than me and like okay let's take as a
62:19 - given that those people are you know
62:21 - more capable than me what can I do is
62:23 - there still a place for me to get things
62:25 - done and so you know just finding things
62:27 - that I can practically do to help yeah
62:30 - so I have a lot of questions that we
62:32 - haven't even gotten to because we've had
62:35 - so many exciting things to talk about uh
62:38 - you you have like of course uh you know
62:41 - your YouTube channels um code code x x
62:46 - yeah like codex like a like a book as
62:48 - opposed to a scroll a book that has like
62:50 - binding early open AI model for coding
62:53 - codex yeah oh okay so
62:56 - um one of the things you do is you are
62:59 - an AI evangelist which sounds like
63:01 - almost like an apocalyptic role maybe
63:04 - you can talk about what you do as an AI
63:06 - evangelist um I'd say it's less about um
63:11 - playing around with all the AI tools and
63:13 - more just thinking like what Cool Tools
63:15 - should devs know about like what are
63:17 - cool AI things that are going to make
63:20 - your life a bit easier if you're coding
63:22 - if you're making websites if you're
63:23 - designing because it's kind of like
63:27 - suddenly a year skipped by and there's
63:30 - dozens and dozens of new tools out there
63:33 - that compete with Adobe and figma and
63:36 - they compete with Photoshop to generate
63:38 - stuff that wasn't capable like the most
63:40 - recent one I've seen and um I can't
63:43 - really say it'll help developers but it
63:45 - helps me is like there's music
63:47 - generation with AI now and these songs
63:50 - that it generates means that I don't
63:51 - have to worry about you know um having
63:54 - copyright music or anything it's a
63:55 - beautiful song made in two seconds from
63:58 - a single prompt in two seconds you get
64:01 - anything you want you if you want like
64:03 - instrumentals if you want Loi if you
64:06 - want um synth it's all there and you
64:08 - just describe what you want like I want
64:11 - um a song about the Roman Empire and you
64:14 - can even have lyrics in there and the
64:15 - lyrics sound like a real person you can
64:17 - even specify what the lyrics say and it
64:19 - turns it into the song so it's it's
64:22 - amazing and that's just like one tool
64:25 - out of many
64:26 - my friend sent me one of those the other
64:27 - day it was like taking about using the
64:29 - restroom on the clock it wasn't exactly
64:32 - like that but like the best 45 minutes
64:34 - of my life you know like getting paid to
64:38 - use the restroom basically and I'm not
64:40 - saying exactly what the lyrics are very
64:42 - crass song but uh yeah it was I I was
64:46 - like wow like did a human really not
64:48 - play a part in writing the lyrics of
64:50 - this I mean you could tell there was
64:51 - artifacts and if you're a musician you
64:53 - can listen and you can be like okay like
64:55 - this is like the most generic you know
64:57 - chord progression or this is like the
64:59 - most generic like drum Tempo or it
65:01 - sounds like they it's just like you
65:02 - threw a bunch of stuff in a blender it
65:04 - doesn't seem original but it is
65:06 - technically original in the way that
65:08 - like a string of text coming from GPT
65:10 - technically if you plug that into Google
65:12 - uh it's extremely improbable that that
65:14 - exact sentence will have occurred before
65:16 - even though you know it's trained on you
65:19 - know but I could see as a Creator just
65:21 - not wanting to worry about copyright
65:22 - strikes that was a huge headache uh
65:24 - anytime you're using any sort of
65:25 - recorded music unless you're doing a
65:27 - Channel about music where you need to
65:28 - like actually use excerpts from music to
65:30 - talk about it uh which should be fair
65:32 - use but even like Rick biato and a lot
65:34 - of the big uh YouTube creators that are
65:35 - in the music space complained about like
65:38 - let Zeppelin I can't even play the the
65:40 - first three notes
65:41 - from cop yeah it's crazy but um it it is
65:46 - a thing and so now ai is coming and
65:49 - solving a lot of problems like even
65:51 - there's an AI website called reloom Ai
65:54 - and what it does is it makes wireframes
65:57 - using Ai and all you do is type in a
65:59 - prompt I I want a website for a nail
66:01 - salon and it creates all the wireframes
66:04 - it creates all the text and sometimes it
66:06 - can even do the visuals for you and it
66:07 - takes like 5 Seconds to create you the
66:09 - concept out for different websites and
66:11 - you can regenerate them so like they're
66:13 - just making the process of building a
66:15 - website a lot
66:17 - faster yeah and um what are some of the
66:22 - other types of AI tools you use and and
66:24 - I do want to get more into like your
66:25 - formal job as an AI like that's on your
66:27 - LinkedIn AI evangelist like is it I
66:30 - didn't even know that I think so I mean
66:33 - I just looked at your LinkedIn a minute
66:34 - ago and I saw that it like jumped out of
66:37 - me you been like I didn't even know yeah
66:41 - yeah well it's it's not your job to like
66:43 - stay on top of LinkedIn when you're m
66:45 - mostly it sounds like you're just
66:46 - working on your
66:47 - own yeah working with like uh you do
66:50 - sponsorships and stuff with uh one um so
66:54 - that Ai and uh version you're talking
66:56 - about was there's a company in West
66:58 - Australia that does um they're called
67:01 - generative and um they do AI project so
67:05 - as I was getting requests for Consulting
67:07 - in AI I would forward them on to these
67:10 - guys ah okay so basically like people
67:14 - come to you all the time probably asking
67:16 - you about AI I had hundreds of emails
67:19 - yeah it was insane especially you
67:21 - basically just like help kind of triage
67:23 - those and steer those to people that
67:25 - actually do contract work in the space
67:27 - correct yes okay that that makes sense
67:30 - so that was what I was referring to when
67:32 - I said AI it's literally originally I I
67:35 - didn't know where to send people and you
67:37 - know that like you don't want to
67:38 - recommend someone when you don't know if
67:40 - that company is any good um you want to
67:42 - actually like meet a few people and
67:44 - actually recommend someone who you trust
67:46 - and know will do the thing properly so
67:47 - like in this case I finally found
67:49 - someone in Australia that does it and so
67:51 - that's why I've been recommending people
67:52 - to that company yeah so that that is
67:55 - like a a heartening note if for any of
67:57 - you out there listening that are really
67:59 - interested in like a specific kind of
68:02 - vertical of technology or something like
68:03 - that eventually you may become so
68:06 - authoritative in that space that you're
68:07 - turning away work and you can get paid
68:09 - to send that work to somebody else who
68:11 - actually has the bandwidth to do that
68:12 - work um yeah it sounds like an enviable
68:15 - position that you've uh established for
68:17 - yourself so um you in addition to being
68:21 - like the the AI guy the low code guy um
68:24 - on YouTube like the one of the serious
68:26 - creators in the space who has a computer
68:28 - science degree and has worked as a
68:30 - developer and as an IT guy for like you
68:32 - know nearly two decades it sounds like
68:34 - like you're somebody who actually uh you
68:38 - know has built out that expertise and
68:40 - that reputation over the years um but in
68:42 - addition to that you also have as I said
68:45 - earlier like serious design skills um
68:48 - and you you've created like a web design
68:51 - road map for example can you talk about
68:53 - your relationship with design yeah sure
68:56 - um when I was doing a lot of the
68:59 - websites to begin with um obviously I
69:02 - didn't have a designer so I had to
69:03 - design them myself so while I was
69:05 - staying ahead of all the programming
69:07 - stuff that was happening I was always
69:08 - staying ahead with all the design stuff
69:10 - that was happening because I was just
69:11 - designing my own ideas so I was always
69:14 - very ahead of the bleeding edge almost
69:16 - of
69:17 - design and over time I learned all the
69:20 - concepts that make a good website look
69:22 - good I was always having a look at like
69:24 - redesigned Concepts for like Facebook or
69:26 - Google or Reddit even and making my own
69:28 - variations on that just as a hobby and
69:31 - over time when I did my YouTube channel
69:34 - I thought well why not like I I started
69:36 - my YouTube channel doing like just
69:38 - websites doing some basic HTML then I
69:41 - grew it out to like other things in
69:43 - programming to react and node and then I
69:45 - thought why not grow it out to design as
69:47 - well but I noticed YouTube punished me
69:49 - when I created content for programming
69:51 - and design cuz they're almost two
69:53 - completely different subjects it's why I
69:55 - created that separate Channel called
69:57 - codex for design and kept programming
69:59 - separate on um on my Adan TW Channel but
70:02 - I did like in um teaching those Design
70:05 - Concepts and I never had any courses or
70:07 - anything like that and I S thought to
70:09 - myself one of the best things I can do
70:11 - is create a course for design so I have
70:14 - my own course that people can learn
70:16 - these fundamentals what especially
70:18 - developers who never learn any design so
70:20 - I made a course called um enhance UI or
70:23 - teach me um design which was
70:25 - specifically designed for developers
70:28 - coming in because I knew the developer
70:29 - mindset I thought I would go through all
70:31 - those fundamentals of like topography
70:33 - and color theory and stuff that I
70:35 - learned over the years but more in a
70:37 - Programming type fashion so I started
70:40 - doing this course and I thought it would
70:41 - take me like a month to do then I
70:43 - thought it would take me half a year to
70:44 - do then I thought it would take me a
70:46 - year to do and I continued to make it
70:48 - and make it and make it and then I
70:49 - teamed up with a guy called George um
70:51 - and we continued to build it and end up
70:53 - being like over 400 pages is long
70:55 - because there's obviously just so many
70:57 - concepts for design but I ended up
70:59 - releasing it almost a year and a half
71:01 - down the track and design is luckily one
71:04 - of those things that never changes like
71:06 - color theory has been around for 100
71:08 - years good topography will never change
71:10 - while different fonts will be popular
71:12 - the fundamentals for that will always be
71:14 - the same I thought if I do it properly
71:16 - and do it once well it'll always be
71:19 - there so unlike react or nextjs every
71:21 - year there's a new version you have to
71:22 - relearn the course or something like
71:24 - that even JavaScript new modules out
71:26 - there design is one of those things that
71:29 - I can make it right the first time and
71:32 - everyone will benefit forever
71:34 - essentially if you learn that course
71:35 - it'll benefit forever into the future
71:37 - from doing it and so I built that course
71:39 - it's called enhance UI um if you go to
71:42 - enhance ui.com right now you can visit
71:44 - it and um and yeah it's doing really
71:47 - well I did like a um I also did a video
71:50 - on every single chapter of that book um
71:53 - so it's like a full on book full on
71:55 - video video course and now I've got
71:56 - exercises and workshops in there and I'm
71:59 - continuously building it out and
72:00 - improving it every year now that I've
72:02 - got it
72:04 - out yeah it's really cool that you it's
72:07 - like a living document and there's like
72:09 - a community around it uh you you have a
72:11 - Discord for it that people join so yeah
72:13 - I've created a Discord I've called that
72:15 - um Discord merge um and I just thought I
72:18 - need to have a different name from codex
72:21 - so I'm slowly creating a new channel
72:22 - called merge as well um on YouTube I
72:25 - third Channel um cuz merge sounds more
72:27 - like a um a thing where I'm talking
72:30 - about design because you're merging code
72:31 - with design so that was my mindset
72:33 - behind it um and yeah if you had to
72:36 - merge I've got a huge community on there
72:38 - and what I do is also I do free design
72:40 - reviews so if you have a website I
72:41 - review it I go over like what you can do
72:43 - to improve it um I'm sharing all these
72:46 - things like the AI tools about how you
72:47 - can create wireframe designs um so
72:51 - that's kind of like the the mindset
72:52 - behind that Community anyway
72:55 - yeah and uh I think it's so cool that
72:57 - you're like so committed to this field
73:00 - of design that you just kind of stumbled
73:02 - into as a developer like as you said you
73:04 - just had to kind of like learn this
73:05 - stuff to in order to be able to do a
73:07 - better job as a developer working on
73:10 - different contracts you know uh
73:11 - obviously like the usability and things
73:13 - like that uh are are important in the
73:16 - functionality but what it looks like the
73:18 - actual Aesthetics are important and you
73:21 - know people care about Aesthetics and
73:24 - what is a Aesthetics what is good
73:26 - typography what is you know like design
73:29 - hierarchy what are a lot of these
73:30 - different concepts well a lot of that
73:32 - stuff was cemented in the kind of like
73:34 - advertising age of like the you know 30s
73:36 - 40s 50s 60s if you've seen Mad Men like
73:39 - one of my favorite shows of all time
73:40 - like they're they're just constantly
73:42 - talking about these things and they're
73:43 - like steeped in that culture of uh what
73:46 - is going to catch the eye what's going
73:47 - to hold attention what's going to be
73:49 - legible if you read uh there's a book uh
73:52 - gosh who is the guy that the big
73:53 - Advertiser guy that uh Ogie Ogie on Ogie
73:58 - his book and he talks about how like
74:00 - they have like this ad for like
74:02 - Volkswagen bug that they've used for
74:04 - like 30 years and they never changed it
74:05 - because it just it works it converts
74:07 - like and why does it work you know and
74:09 - and like trying to understand strip that
74:11 - down to the nuts and bolts and
74:12 - understand the actual design
74:14 - considerations um so just like with like
74:17 - free C Camp and Mathematics where huge
74:19 - Advocates of learning mathematics and
74:21 - Mathematics doesn't really change it's
74:23 - been like more or less the same for the
74:25 - last 2,000 years and then people have
74:26 - layered some additional stuff on it it's
74:28 - one of those skills that if you like
74:30 - really learn it properly you don't have
74:32 - to keep coming back to it right uh you
74:34 - could you just for the rest of your life
74:35 - you have that toolbox for uh you know
74:39 - understanding what is good design and
74:41 - being able to create things on the Fly
74:43 - and being able to recognize good design
74:45 - in other things uh so this this sounds
74:48 - like a really cool book and and a really
74:50 - cool course yeah um and a while back you
74:54 - sent me like a book that was like one of
74:55 - the most beautiful I guess
74:57 - self-published books like it I'd never
75:00 - seen a book where every page looked so
75:04 - you know deliberated upon uh yeah can
75:07 - you tell me a little bit about that book
75:08 - is that the same book yeah it is it's um
75:11 - originally I got inspired by someone
75:13 - called um Chris doe he runs a channel
75:15 - called the future it's a Design Channel
75:18 - and so he wrote a book and it was just
75:20 - like his own kind of personal book about
75:24 - himself but what he did in that book was
75:26 - every page on its opposite side had a
75:29 - beautiful visual he had created in his
75:32 - you know life and it was like a design
75:35 - image and so I thought if I'm going to
75:37 - create this book for developers and I
75:40 - want to teach a a concept about color
75:42 - theory how about I create a beautiful
75:44 - visual for every single one of these
75:46 - Pages it's one of the reason the book is
75:48 - like 400 Pages um plus it's because 200
75:51 - pages is the content and the other 200
75:55 - pages are the beautiful visuals that
75:57 - explain or represent that Visual and so
76:00 - if you've ever followed uh George mher
76:02 - on Twitter you might have also seen he's
76:04 - done a lot of those visuals as well on
76:06 - like things like react and stuff if you
76:07 - can visually show someone like a folder
76:10 - structure in a beautiful way it's a lot
76:12 - more appealing than if you just see a
76:15 - snapshot of vs code and so that's the
76:16 - mindset I brought into creating the book
76:19 - so that I wanted the experience of
76:21 - reading it to be almost like a very nice
76:23 - one I've got like motiv quotes in there
76:26 - from aspiring artists to like beautiful
76:29 - visuals that represent um things like
76:31 - the topography itself so that you can
76:33 - see as well as read the
76:36 - content yeah yeah that's so cool and I'm
76:40 - just curious like how much time does it
76:42 - take like what tools do you use to lay
76:43 - that out by the way you so I actually
76:46 - got the proper in design from Adobe and
76:48 - I build that up properly as a published
76:51 - book that can be then later on printed
76:53 - and I've done a dark version
76:55 - and a light version I just haven't gone
76:57 - through the process of seeing if I can
76:59 - get it printed on Amazon yet but that is
77:00 - like one of the steps I want to do in
77:02 - the future too yeah I mean you you can
77:05 - basically take any book and put it on
77:07 - Amazon and they can print it now whether
77:08 - it's going to be like this fancy bound
77:11 - kind of like coffee table book like
77:13 - there are books that cost 50 bucks 100
77:16 - bucks right like Getty Lee put out a
77:18 - book about the electric bass right and I
77:22 - was like oh man that'd be amazing but
77:23 - I'm not spending like I don't know much
77:25 - the book is it's like 100 bucks Getty
77:27 - Lee book base if you don't know who
77:30 - Getty Lee is he's the uh the Bas player
77:33 - for Rush and he's yeah it's it's a $50
77:37 - Hefty book probably weigh several pounds
77:39 - I may get one I may get a copy I love
77:41 - bass um but like if if you wanted to
77:43 - print like an actual like thick uh 400
77:47 - page like nice paper quality book that's
77:50 - going to sit on somebody's coffee table
77:51 - or going to sit on a bookshelf behind
77:54 - somebody like me me wink nudge nudge
77:56 - wink wink if you do print one and you
77:57 - ship it to me I will put it on the the
77:59 - bookshelf behind me I've been looking
78:00 - for good books to put on there
78:02 - um you may need to go to a special
78:05 - publisher for that uh or you may be able
78:07 - to do like I don't know if anybody still
78:08 - does kickstarters but something like
78:10 - that to to get the publication of it uh
78:12 - but I'd be very interested in having a
78:15 - physical copy at some point um and I
78:17 - think a lot of people listening for this
78:19 - would be too because I love design and
78:21 - I've spent so much time at bookstores
78:24 - just flipping through different books on
78:26 - like Design Concepts and things like
78:27 - that that are just very beautifully
78:30 - crafted and uh like a lot of times
78:32 - they'll be like really weird shapes like
78:33 - they'll be really giant or really small
78:36 - and you like flip through them and they
78:37 - find all these creative ways to
78:38 - illustrate the different concepts and
78:40 - and I had lots of friends uh when I was
78:42 - in college who were designers as well so
78:45 - like yeah it's it's a field of personal
78:46 - interest for me even though like if you
78:48 - look at free C Camp we have like an
78:50 - extremely like almost brutalist if
78:52 - you're familiar with like the brutalist
78:54 - movement of Architecture is like bare
78:56 - concrete you know like it it's free C
78:59 - Camp is very much uh simple and like we
79:03 - don't we don't do anything fancy like we
79:05 - we just like exactly what you know uh
79:08 - inspired by that kind of pragmatic like
79:10 - practical like we I I call it command
79:13 - line
79:14 - Chic uh because I was trying to like
79:17 - recreate the feel of being in a command
79:19 - line like uh maybe like MS DOS era
79:22 - whenever you're like doing a Bo or
79:24 - something I said let's let's redesign
79:26 - your website cuz I could make it you
79:27 - know look good but you're like you like
79:30 - it to be that brutalist style cuz I've
79:33 - actually redone um like I've even done
79:35 - Jesse or code stacker like a design
79:37 - course on sorry no I think he has a vs
79:39 - course super code superhero like I've
79:42 - done a few designs for for a couple of
79:45 - the creators but uh if you ever want a
79:47 - free code C freesign you should do a
79:49 - course like like let's redesign free
79:51 - Coke camp like maybe we can incorporate
79:53 - some of the ideas uh yeah like a lot of
79:55 - the the reason free C Camp looks the way
79:57 - it is is because we have a lot of people
79:59 - accessing us with like very limited data
80:01 - everything has to be really high
80:02 - performance we we use very few images um
80:05 - but here's where like you use a little
80:07 - bit of smarts of like can we do a super
80:09 - fast speed test on their connection
80:11 - within the very first 2 point seconds of
80:14 - the um load and if it's a slow
80:16 - connection you give them a l slow lowy
80:19 - version of the website if they got B
80:21 - connection bu so those are that's how I
80:24 - think I'm like how can I revent this to
80:26 - give them that and you you find that
80:28 - that's what the news websites do right
80:30 - they actually have a low-fi and a high-f
80:32 - five version and the LOI is actually for
80:34 - their SEO so when Google and crawlers
80:36 - hit their website they get a very fast
80:38 - Snappy website with have all the article
80:40 - you go on there and you have a 100
80:42 - videos and ads everywhere and you can't
80:44 - even read the article so it's like how
80:46 - how are they even indexing it so yeah
80:48 - there's tricks around that interesting
80:50 - yeah I had even thought about that but
80:52 - yeah if you because everything you do is
80:54 - like slightly adding to the time but if
80:55 - you can do it fast enough everybody can
80:57 - have a decent experience and and people
80:59 - who have you know I've got like 500
81:02 - megabits here in Texas like we're we're
81:05 - spoiled here in the United States and so
81:07 - I could easily go to like the most
81:08 - multimedia intensive website and I
81:10 - probably wouldn't even notice the load
81:11 - time uh and I I imagine a lot of people
81:14 - listening are in like South Korea or
81:16 - some place like that that has
81:17 - ridiculously fast internet too um okay
81:20 - so uh I am really interested in talking
81:24 - about the the pandemic a little bit just
81:26 - because you made such heavy use of that
81:29 - uh what were some things that you did to
81:32 - really capitalize on the fact that so
81:34 - many people are getting online all at
81:36 - the same time like Freo camp we
81:38 - experienced a dramatic surge in usage
81:41 - which unfortunately it's kind of like
81:41 - tapered off because you know people uh a
81:44 - lot of people uh their ambition was
81:47 - bigger their eyes were bigger than their
81:49 - stomach and once they actually started
81:50 - coding and like getting into it they're
81:51 - like I can't do this for the rest of my
81:52 - life uh but a lot of people state of
81:54 - course so like I think most websites I
81:57 - know like learning websites and then
81:59 - down but like the Baseline is like twice
82:01 - as high as it was before the pandemic
82:03 - maybe you can talk about uh yeah what
82:06 - yeah um what you did I didn't
82:09 - particularly tackle the pandemic from a
82:11 - business point of view to like get the
82:13 - YouTube channel working really well I
82:15 - think at that point in time was when I
82:17 - started YouTube and I saw some small guy
82:20 - called Flor and Pop um and he he
82:24 - published this blog saying that he's
82:25 - going to make 30 videos in 30 days and
82:27 - I'm like that's easy I'll make 300 video
82:31 - or 365 videos in a year and so that's
82:34 - where I had that idea to to make a video
82:37 - every single day and while I didn't make
82:39 - 365 videos I think 300 is a pretty good
82:42 - success rate um for videos in the year
82:45 - and I suppose that was the mindset I
82:47 - went into it like I I kind of treated it
82:49 - as as as a challenge but whether I got
82:52 - subscribers or not wasn't the goal my
82:53 - goal was like can I make a better video
82:55 - than what's online right now and that's
82:58 - a good goal because that's measurable
82:59 - you can't control how many people
83:00 - subscribe to your video like I see
83:02 - people all the time make the mistake
83:03 - like I'm just going to get to a thousand
83:06 - followers on like Instagram or on on
83:08 - YouTube or wherever and they make the
83:10 - goal some sort of number that's
83:11 - completely outside of their control but
83:13 - what you did is you like every video is
83:15 - going to be 1% better and that's
83:16 - subjective but like you did have the
83:18 - concrete goal of I'm going to publish a
83:20 - video every day for 300 days that is
83:22 - something control that I contr control
83:25 - making a good video I couldn't control
83:27 - if it gets views or subscribers and that
83:29 - didn't matter to me at all yeah so to
83:32 - some extent it was just like brute
83:34 - forcing your way to Brilliance like
83:36 - spending a lot of time and energy yeah
83:38 - creating videos and and that process was
83:41 - where you were honed so to speak correct
83:45 - so let's say hypothetically somebody was
83:47 - starting today knowing what you know
83:49 - today if you had like zero we presence
83:51 - and maybe you didn't even have the
83:52 - skills that you have currently would you
83:54 - do the same thing would you just dive in
83:56 - and just start building would and if you
83:57 - have a look at like one of the popular
83:59 - people out there Josh tried coding
84:02 - that's what he did and if you have a
84:03 - look he's having a lot of success but if
84:05 - you watch his early videos that's quite
84:07 - him learning how to code and then
84:10 - sharing what he's learned step by step
84:13 - by step and while it was very raw at the
84:16 - beginning you can see his improvement
84:18 - over time and it's very personal and
84:20 - very
84:21 - genuine yeah so um one of the things
84:25 - that you've said that uh is that even
84:28 - with AI tools you still need to know the
84:31 - fundamentals uh that that like you know
84:34 - tooling is never a replacement for
84:36 - actual comprehension of what's going on
84:37 - under the hood and like being a
84:41 - fundamentals what are the fundamentals
84:43 - that you would encourage web developers
84:45 - to learn in
84:46 - 2024 I think and this is what I
84:48 - recommend still to anyone who ask me
84:51 - they want to start coding I actually do
84:52 - Point them to a free code count and I
84:54 - say learn the responsive web design
84:56 - course where you learn HTML CSS in
84:58 - JavaScript because that is the best um
85:01 - way to enter into learning to code it's
85:03 - got like really good tests and examples
85:05 - and it really teaches you that kind of
85:07 - stuff so like I think that's one of the
85:10 - like the the easiest most like there
85:12 - isn't a pay wall behind it either so yes
85:15 - I funny enough you have put together a
85:17 - really good resource for that one yeah
85:20 - uh so so is there any like other big
85:23 - skills like would you consider design a
85:25 - skill that's got to have or would you
85:27 - consider like a i' Sayce to design is
85:30 - something you can look at after you
85:32 - start building websites once you're in
85:33 - there and you're building content um for
85:36 - yourself or for companies then you can
85:37 - start looking at design so I wouldn't
85:39 - say oh do my design calls first and then
85:41 - learn to code because that's not going
85:42 - to serve you as well learning to code
85:45 - will probably serve you really well if
85:47 - that's what you want to do obviously if
85:49 - you don't want to be a coder and you
85:50 - just want to learn design do my design
85:52 - course of course yeah awesome and let's
85:55 - talk about low code and no code so a lot
85:57 - of people a lot of developers especially
85:59 - are like ah they Gran every time you
86:01 - they hear low code or no code just like
86:03 - people might have grown when they heard
86:04 - Microsoft front page when they were
86:06 - building their own websites uh back in
86:08 - or Dream Weaver or something like that
86:09 - that like tries to simplify this you
86:12 - know more like high touch uh process of
86:16 - artisanally crafting a website rather
86:18 - than just you know throwing a bunch of
86:20 - templates together right um how would
86:22 - you describe no code how is it different
86:24 - from low code and then like maybe give
86:27 - me like an idea of for whom those are
86:32 - useful so I would hope that most people
86:35 - that are developers have used figma
86:38 - before because often developers and
86:40 - programmers are converting figma designs
86:42 - into code and figma is a full design
86:45 - piece of software it's almost like
86:47 - Photoshop and I think no code is getting
86:51 - to the point where you can drag and drop
86:54 - and create a visual
86:57 - design and it's already coded that's B
87:00 - basically it you don't have to worry
87:01 - about writing any boxes you don't have
87:03 - to worry about any alignment you just
87:05 - drag it into place and it's right there
87:07 - and I've seen the Stepping Stones of
87:10 - these where like originally you could
87:12 - drag an element um in um with Elementor
87:16 - or weo and then you still have to code
87:18 - out like the padding and everything like
87:19 - that you have to understand those
87:21 - principles of like how HTML works and
87:24 - how sections work and how divs work and
87:26 - it's slowly move like the no code
87:28 - movement is slowly moving away to that
87:30 - to quite literally you do not have to
87:32 - know what's happening under the hood you
87:33 - just drag the elements into how you want
87:36 - them to look and it just it just
87:38 - works so that's what I find really
87:40 - interesting because I wonder like how
87:41 - much coding will be involved in the
87:43 - future besides building the
87:46 - functionality under the hood and this is
87:48 - where like the low code no code will be
87:51 - like visuals are built by designers and
87:53 - then fun functionality built is built by
87:56 - programmers and there's almost going to
87:57 - be a separation between the two at some
87:59 - stage I
88:00 - think interesting so you think that like
88:03 - right now like a lot of web developers
88:04 - do their own design work as well but you
88:07 - do think that things are going to become
88:08 - more Specialized or do you think that
88:10 - like low code tools will allow a
88:12 - mediocre designer to do design work so
88:16 - they can focus on the development work
88:17 - and vice versa for like a mediocre
88:19 - developer I do think that program focus
88:22 - on yeah I do think that programmers and
88:25 - designers will be using no code tools in
88:26 - the future for any marketing company or
88:29 - um web company because it's just easier
88:32 - faster and um better in all manner like
88:36 - you can build a where I used to build
88:38 - websites in two weeks down to like a
88:40 - week down to four days you can use no
88:42 - code to do that in four hours so if it
88:45 - it takes you four hours and you have a
88:46 - website that's secure and looks exactly
88:48 - the same and it's responsive and now you
88:51 - can update it in seconds rather than
88:53 - hours it's a no-brainer for any business
88:56 - in that point of view right and so
88:59 - that's where like a lot of the industry
89:01 - for business is moving that way so if
89:03 - you want to do that of course there's
89:05 - still functionality in businesses that
89:06 - build applications that integrate with
89:08 - AI or do different things with cameras
89:11 - or whatever it is and so for that
89:13 - programmers need to understand the
89:14 - fundamentals you can't particularly have
89:16 - no code tools jump in that easily you
89:19 - usually have to build web web apps and
89:21 - that's where a lot of the programmers
89:22 - will probably be going in that that
89:25 - regard yeah yeah that's definitely like
89:27 - uh I've seen a lot of programmers who
89:30 - are resistant to using those tools
89:32 - almost like like John Henry like I can
89:34 - drive spikes faster than this damn
89:36 - machine you know like that kind of like
89:38 - mentality but at the same time like a
89:40 - lot of them are like well I I use it for
89:42 - this or I use it for that and the number
89:43 - of things they use it for may be slowly
89:45 - growing and it's not necessarily going
89:47 - to replace that developer instinct or
89:49 - the designer eye or things like that but
89:51 - it does you know provide additional
89:54 - leverage so that you can use what you
89:56 - know and your your expertise to get
89:57 - things done faster right I like to think
90:00 - of it as farming right a farmer might go
90:03 - to you and say I can use my hands to
90:05 - scoop out a hole and put a seed in there
90:07 - and pack the Earth in perfectly so why I
90:10 - not always use my hands the next farmer
90:12 - might go oh I have a tool to plow and
90:14 - then a tool to like throw the seeds in
90:16 - there and a tool to compress it so why
90:18 - not use those tools then the next farmer
90:20 - might go I have a machine that does a
90:22 - thousand of these and the seeds for a
90:25 - thousand things and does the um
90:26 - articulations for a thousand of these
90:28 - and then the next farmer goes well I
90:30 - have an AI that does an entire acre for
90:32 - me and all I click is start and it does
90:35 - all the seeding all the watering and
90:37 - everything so at each stage a farmer
90:39 - still needs to understand the um
90:41 - fundamentals but it doesn't mean that
90:43 - the farmer who's manually digging out
90:45 - the soil and putting one seed in there
90:47 - is doing it any better or worse it just
90:48 - means the tools now are kind of Greater
90:52 - and if you want to use ize them sure you
90:55 - can you might have more success and from
90:56 - a business point of view it makes sense
90:59 - but it doesn't take away from the fact
91:00 - that you know how to do that
91:02 - either
91:04 - yeah let's talk about AI tools because
91:07 - sure obviously you're an AI evangelist
91:10 - and you know a lot about AI tooling and
91:12 - you've been working with these since
91:14 - before before it was cool right uh back
91:17 - when you were like one of the few people
91:18 - who who cared to use these you know at
91:21 - the time very limited tools um what AI
91:24 - tools do you use kind of like currently
91:28 - like uh can you maybe rattle off some
91:30 - tools that you use maybe every week I
91:32 - think my dayto day the most I use is
91:35 - obviously GitHub co-pilot it allows me
91:38 - to autocomplete any programming code
91:41 - that I'm trying to figure out which is
91:44 - it's useful it's very
91:46 - useful I do use chat GPT for uh
91:50 - brainstorming so if I have like
91:52 - questions or I'm trying to
91:54 - almost treated like a psychologist where
91:56 - I'm trying to figure out what I'm trying
91:58 - to say or do it helps me kind of
92:01 - brainstorm in that
92:03 - regard um and then I also use um I have
92:08 - 11 Labs it's not really programming but
92:11 - it replicates my voice to such a degree
92:13 - that people can't recognize when I use
92:15 - the AI voice in my own voice and
92:18 - sometimes in videos or in content I can
92:20 - just use that right up a script and
92:22 - suddenly I've already said the script
92:24 - which is great yeah and I've talked with
92:27 - like Andrew Brown in a previous episode
92:28 - Andrew Brown exam Pro creator of many uh
92:32 - tutorials and he actually has like a
92:33 - degenerative voice condition so he makes
92:35 - heavy use of AI uh Speech synthesis
92:39 - tools and Freo Camp has a course coming
92:42 - up soon that will teach you how to uh to
92:44 - like kind of wrap your voice around like
92:46 - a you know a like a newscast or whatever
92:50 - other piece of audio to make it sound
92:51 - like you're saying it or you can speak
92:52 - different languages it's very cool
92:54 - without having actually put in the time
92:56 - to actually learn that's cool call me
92:58 - old school but I really enjoy learning
92:59 - languages and I will continue to do that
93:01 - though I'll probably never have time to
93:02 - like learn German for example so uh this
93:05 - will be a convenient tool if I need to
93:06 - like you know ever pretend that I can
93:08 - speak German or or Just Dub videos into
93:11 - German uh so it sounds like you're do
93:15 - you actively like follow what what is
93:17 - your information diet like how do you
93:19 - stay up on all the development in AI
93:22 - this very fast moving field I don't know
93:24 - I just think my feed tells me whether it
93:27 - is on Tik Tok or Google news or um
93:30 - YouTube or Reddit like just seem to
93:32 - stumble across these things and um if
93:35 - they're not getting much traction of his
93:37 - ability I like to create video content
93:39 - on it too so yeah yeah that's very cool
93:42 - so you're just out there you're just
93:43 - like consuming and reading you don't
93:46 - have like some carefully curated like
93:48 - RSS feed uh like that that is like
93:51 - exactly what you want to be learning uh
93:54 - I mean do you listen to like particular
93:56 - podcasts or anything like that to stay
93:58 - up on things no no podcasts I
94:01 - technically like I don't read the
94:03 - newspaper I don't really check out
94:06 - Reddit um like for the most part it's
94:10 - just somehow the algorithms on Google
94:12 - News tell me the Google News algorithms
94:15 - are pretty good in that
94:18 - regard yeah that's very cool so um I
94:22 - guess there's like you know in terms of
94:24 - productivity and something like just not
94:26 - taking the time to try to curate an
94:27 - information diet and just relying on
94:29 - algorithms to serve up good stuff it
94:31 - seems to be working for you yeah yeah
94:33 - for sure for sure awesome and just like
94:37 - a final kind of like question about like
94:39 - AI tool Tooling in general uh let's say
94:42 - you had a new client like maybe you can
94:45 - talk about how developing like a you
94:48 - know a marketing website for like
94:50 - somebody's got like some pharmaceutical
94:52 - product or something they want to create
94:53 - a website for that what would that
94:56 - process look
94:57 - like when you were first starting and
94:59 - what would that process look like today
95:01 - maybe you can just walk us through from
95:03 - memory what it used to be like and now
95:05 - what you would do if you had suddenly a
95:07 - job like that it's a good question I
95:09 - guess uh in the
95:11 - past um I would actually have a graphics
95:14 - designer so like the salesperson would
95:17 - kind of um make the sale their Graphics
95:19 - designer would put together all the
95:21 - assets in Adobe XD and then I would sit
95:24 - down and using Wordpress I would spend
95:27 - two weeks almost or like a week just
95:30 - writing out every template file for the
95:33 - homepage for all the subpages the
95:35 - headers the Footers writing out all the
95:37 - HTML writing out all the CSS I think I'd
95:40 - have like 5 to 10,000 lines of CSS maybe
95:43 - 5 to 10,000 lines of
95:45 - HTML and then I would spend a week like
95:48 - I would spend days doing all the
95:49 - responsive design and I would spend days
95:53 - um testing for all the bugs that would
95:55 - happen and eventually I'd pass that back
95:57 - to the designer there'd be new mockups
95:59 - I'd have to revise that
96:01 - design um and finally ship it to you
96:04 - know back to the sales guy who would
96:05 - present it to the client whereas now
96:09 - like I can sit down in a day and build
96:11 - it with the client in front of him just
96:14 - Dragon droing elements or pre-made
96:16 - templates and moving the about and
96:18 - putting his con um his work straight in
96:21 - there in front of him and even show him
96:23 - how to do that so that if he needs to
96:25 - make changes I don't have to do them
96:27 - every single time either so it's a
96:29 - completely different
96:31 - process wow that's dramatic so going
96:34 - from something that might take like an
96:36 - entire month of going back and forth
96:38 - have lots of parties involved to you
96:39 - literally being able to interface
96:41 - directly with the client right in front
96:42 - of them and build it out how would that
96:44 - affect billing if they're like oh this
96:45 - only took you like you know a few hours
96:48 - to build this website like how much do
96:49 - you think you could charge versus how
96:51 - much you used to be able to charge well
96:53 - if someone said they can build you a
96:55 - house rather than in a year they can do
96:57 - it for you in a month does that make the
96:58 - house more valuable or less valuable now
97:01 - that you don't have to pay for your
97:02 - mortgage for the rest of the year and
97:03 - you can move in objectively that doesn't
97:05 - that doesn't have any sort of I mean it
97:07 - makes the house more valuable for sure
97:10 - but traditionally have looked at work is
97:13 - like like there's that that old uh
97:15 - anecdote about Picasso right so Picasso
97:17 - is sitting in a cafe and uh This Woman's
97:20 - like oh Picasso can you draw something
97:22 - for me and he he takes out a you know
97:24 - pen and a piece of paper he's like does
97:27 - like one of his beautiful like oneline
97:28 - paintings like where he draws like the
97:30 - Wiener Dog with a single line from a pen
97:33 - and it takes it's just a few quick
97:34 - strokes and it takes a few seconds and
97:36 - she's like this is amazing thank you and
97:39 - he says that'll be $5,000 and she's like
97:42 - what $5,000 it only took you a few
97:44 - minutes and and he's like yes but it
97:47 - took me 60 years to become
97:50 - Picasso yeah right that's exactly it
97:52 - that's how things work and that's how
97:54 - value is created in the world but that's
97:56 - not how people are used to thinking it
97:57 - most people would be like that lady and
97:59 - they'd be like shocked like really you
98:00 - want thousands of dollars for what took
98:02 - you that much time but you as a
98:05 - developer as a designer uh as you know
98:08 - essentially a product manager uh
98:11 - have uh built this skill set you've
98:13 - learned how to use all these tools um
98:16 - like how much would you charge like in
98:18 - theory if somebody wanted like I'm not
98:20 - sure if anybody in the audience actually
98:22 - would want to pay your hourly or
98:23 - whatever but like if you were to sit
98:25 - down with somebody and build something
98:27 - right in front of them to their
98:28 - specifications what would that cost now
98:31 - versus what what might it have cost to
98:33 - have that entire mon as I said before it
98:35 - used to cost about $2,000 to do in a
98:38 - week or two now it cost about $20,000
98:41 - but I can get it done in a
98:44 - day and if you think about it I I always
98:47 - like to get the metaphor of like imagine
98:50 - you have a problem with your tooth it's
98:52 - a pain you know like a business pain
98:55 - right it's a pain in your tooth and you
98:56 - need a root canal now imagine having a
98:59 - to wait two months for a root canal and
99:01 - you have to come in five times for five
99:03 - surgeries for a root canal and by the
99:06 - end of it you spend half a year and
99:07 - $10,000 for a root canal I give you a
99:11 - procedure that takes a day and gets rid
99:13 - of that root canal for like you know
99:15 - about the same cost and it doesn't cause
99:17 - you any pain whatsoever would that not
99:19 - be more valuable to you than going
99:22 - through all that dentist pain and so
99:24 - that's the business mindset that uh
99:26 - business owners think about because for
99:28 - them their website means they're getting
99:30 - less conversions every day it's not
99:32 - working is that pain of a tooth
99:36 - essentially yeah that's a great way of
99:38 - framing it um and like what advice would
99:42 - you give to somebody who's doing like
99:44 - freelance development work and doing
99:45 - design work and potentially learning
99:47 - these tools so they can do what you do
99:49 - or they can sit down with the client
99:50 - like what advice would you give to them
99:53 - as as far as broaching that with a
99:55 - client who might already have it in
99:56 - their mind but it would only took you a
99:58 - few hours like I mean the ruk canal
100:00 - analogy of course something
100:03 - like yeah I would say go on YouTube
100:06 - search up Chris do Chris
100:09 - Doo um from the future and he has
100:13 - thousands of videos on how to talk with
100:16 - clients on exactly this subject to
100:18 - showcase the value of what you're
100:21 - building rather than just the hours that
100:24 - you're
100:26 - working
100:28 - yeah awesome man well that that is a
100:30 - great advice and I will look him up and
100:32 - I'll include a link to him in the show
100:34 - notes Adrian it's been so amazing
100:37 - catching up with you thanks for staying
100:38 - up late uh and just uh sharing your many
100:42 - insights with the community I hope
100:44 - everybody tuning in has learned a great
100:46 - deal from Adrien I hope you'll uh check
100:48 - out his his book hope you'll check out
100:50 - some of his you know free Cod Camp
100:51 - courses he's got a epic
100:53 - you know wire Framing and like
100:55 - development I think you use figma you
100:57 - may use some other tools in that video
100:59 - course that we published a while back uh
101:01 - are we going to get some new videos from
101:02 - you in the future yeah I think so I've
101:05 - got um some plugs in the roots oh sorry
101:07 - in the works and I've got some video
101:09 - content that I'm doing for the enhanced
101:12 - UI book so I'll see if I can maybe turn
101:14 - that into like a five hour long course
101:16 - for you guys cuz the minimum amount of
101:18 - time usually for a video of
101:21 - yours well I again I've learned so much
101:25 - from you over time uh and I'm continuing
101:28 - to learn like just over the past hour
101:29 - and a half I've learned a tremendous
101:30 - amount from you and it it's so
101:32 - refreshing to hear your perspective
101:34 - because I don't think you're a
101:36 - contrarian and you're like thinking
101:38 - differently from everybody else just to
101:41 - stand out I think you just have the most
101:44 - kind of pragmatic perspective on getting
101:46 - things done and it's so refreshing it's
101:48 - like you're like the least dogmatic
101:50 - person I've ever talked to in this field
101:52 - probably like all right well that's good
101:54 - to hear yeah it's great so um yeah well
101:58 - thank you again and for everybody uh
102:01 - listening to this I hope you enjoyed
102:03 - learning from Adrien and uh until next
102:06 - week happy coding thanks say yeah
