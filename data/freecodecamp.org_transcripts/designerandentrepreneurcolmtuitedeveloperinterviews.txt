00:04 - hey everyone we are live here with
00:08 - column
00:09 - cheat hey guys happy St Patrick's Day
00:14 - happy St Patrick's Day I I guess that's
00:16 - particularly relevant because colum grew
00:20 - up Dublin Ireland and he still lives
00:23 - there and works as a freelance designer
00:25 - there uh colums built a startup and it
00:29 - was a acquired a couple years ago by a
00:32 - company called Marvel app that works
00:35 - with uh design prototyping tools and uh
00:38 - he's joining us now from Dublin where he
00:42 - has not had too much to drink yet he
00:44 - told
00:45 - [Laughter]
00:47 - me that's what you
00:50 - think well you're very good at carrying
00:53 - on a conversation
00:54 - then I can I'm pretty
00:57 - sober right unfortun
01:00 - well thank you for your
01:02 - sacrifice so our live audience thanks
01:05 - you for your
01:10 - coherence um
01:13 - colum tell us a little bit about your
01:15 - background my understanding is you as a
01:17 - high schooler you basically dropped out
01:20 - and you just focused on pursuing
01:23 - music and then after pursuing music for
01:26 - a while you transition into doing design
01:30 - work can you tell us a little bit about
01:31 - that entire era of your
01:34 - life yeah
01:37 - um so yeah I mean I didn't really drop
01:40 - out of high school but I mean I just uh
01:42 - in my last two years I guess I didn't
01:45 - attend many classes I guess you could
01:47 - put it that way and so yeah I was just
01:50 - like really big into music I didn't I
01:52 - wasn't really getting much out of high
01:53 - school didn't really wasn't into many
01:55 - the topics that we were studying um and
01:58 - I had a I had a publishing a film and TV
02:01 - publishing deal with a a company in La
02:04 - called editor Choice
02:06 - music so I was just like you know
02:08 - staying home learning trying to learn
02:11 - instruments studying music theory and
02:13 - just really big into that whole world um
02:15 - and my school my high school didn't
02:18 - offer music so it was just like
02:20 - inaccessible there
02:22 - so um so yeah and I spent like six years
02:26 - um just studying music Non-Stop and
02:29 - trying trying to make it in that whole
02:31 - you know
02:32 - industry but uh like got to a point
02:35 - where I hit a wall kind of it's just
02:37 - like music IND industry is funny it's
02:40 - kind of it's really locked down you know
02:42 - when you get to a certain point it's
02:44 - just so hard to like push through and go
02:46 - take it further you'd really have to
02:49 - like move to LA and like um you know
02:52 - really start uh building connections and
02:54 - like things like that like going to
02:56 - auditions and stuff like I mean I guess
02:58 - my ultimate goal was to like become a
03:00 - session musician of some sort like play
03:02 - guitar you know in studios and like you
03:05 - know tour with some type of live act
03:08 - make money that
03:09 - way but it's just so competitive it's so
03:12 - tough and like um in terms of
03:14 - songwriting and things like it's really
03:15 - locked down there's like an inner circle
03:17 - of songwriters that just write all pop
03:20 - music and and it's hard to break in so
03:22 - yeah eventually I like kind of you know
03:26 - became disheartened with that and wasn't
03:28 - really sure what I wanted to do and my
03:30 - dad had um had a print company just a
03:33 - very small print shop in my
03:35 - hometown um it was just him and his
03:38 - business partner so he just asked me one
03:40 - day that I want to come down and check
03:41 - it out so I went down H and he gave me
03:44 - one of those old uh bubble IMAX and just
03:47 - sat me in in a dark corner in the back
03:49 - room and just like gave me like some
03:51 - cracked copy of
03:52 - Illustrator and just like just just let
03:56 - me let me add it you know and I I just
03:58 - fell in love like straight away just
03:59 - just became completely enamored with the
04:01 - whole world of design you know I had no
04:04 - idea what I was doing at all wasn't even
04:07 - sure like what the the various paper
04:08 - sizes were like A3 and A2 A1
04:12 - Etc um but yeah I worked there for like
04:15 - four years with them you know just
04:17 - learned
04:18 - everything um you know just off the cuff
04:20 - just like took a flyer poster and tried
04:23 - to copy an illustrator tried to recreate
04:25 - things business cards and you know just
04:27 - learned everything about print indry
04:31 - um and then you know after after four
04:33 - four years or four and a half years
04:34 - there um
04:37 - I I I got into web design through um
04:41 - what was the program I was using like a
04:44 - wizzy wig editor freeway that was that's
04:46 - what it was called it was like I don't
04:47 - know if you've heard it yeah freeway
04:49 - it's kind of like um it was like Dream
04:52 - Weaver you know back in the day it was
04:54 - like a wizzywig editor where you could
04:57 - like drag and drop elements to create a
05:00 - website and then you know deploy it live
05:03 - without writing without writing any code
05:05 - at all um so that's that's how I like
05:07 - transitioned into web design um and then
05:10 - my brother who my brother was a
05:12 - programmer at the time he's two years
05:14 - older than me so he was he was
05:15 - constantly pushing me to to write to
05:18 - learn HTML and CSS you know I'd have in
05:21 - one of my websites that I've built with
05:23 - freeway I'd have like some issue and I'd
05:25 - go run to him and ask him how can I fix
05:27 - it and he'd be like oh dude I can't I
05:28 - can't even read this code it's
05:32 - terrible those apps the most garbage
05:36 - code so I mean I had no idea what I was
05:39 - handling him but it was just like here
05:40 - trying and fix this um so yeah he was
05:43 - like constantly pressuring me to learn
05:45 - code um and eventually you know I just
05:49 - just learned some HML CSS online and uh
05:52 - then left that print shop I was working
05:53 - for and went down on my own
05:57 - freelancing awesome and your freelancing
06:00 - career ultimately uh transition into you
06:03 - building a
06:04 - product yeah well many products I had a
06:09 - I built like five or six or more
06:12 - probably startups yeah with my brother
06:14 - most of them with my brother
06:16 - um yeah we had no idea like this is
06:18 - going back seven eight years ago you
06:21 - know we were just like one of them we
06:23 - tried to build a um an app for for like
06:27 - a rental app you know for buying for
06:30 - renting or for buying
06:32 - houses and we were just using rails you
06:34 - know my brother was a rails programmer
06:37 - and uh you know we just tried to get
06:39 - that going you tried to get something
06:40 - going for the print shop that I was
06:41 - working at it was like Trello but just
06:43 - for print for the print
06:46 - industry um yeah tried a bunch of things
06:48 - and they all just failed miserably and
06:51 - and then uh just yeah one day I mean I
06:53 - was freelance freelancing there then for
06:55 - a few years uh you know just various
06:58 - clients and
07:00 - and building startups on the side and uh
07:03 - yeah I started Plexi which was a design
07:06 - Tool uh which was a web based design too
07:09 - so it's kind of like sketch but like um
07:14 - you know no way as like much more
07:16 - simpler you know much more simpler than
07:18 - than sketch um and it was in the browser
07:22 - and it was I tried to focus on
07:25 - animation like interaction based design
07:29 - um so yeah I I built the first version
07:31 - of that on my own with my extremely
07:33 - limited JavaScript
07:35 - skills and just like put a really really
07:38 - rough prototype on designer news and it
07:41 - did well like you know a lot of people
07:43 - took interest and a lot of people
07:44 - emailed me about it encouraged me to to
07:46 - keep working on
07:48 - it um so yeah kept working on that for
07:52 - like two years I hired a guy in uh
07:54 - called Elliott in New York he was like
07:57 - he was about 18 at the time uh
07:59 - it really amazed me like how he he had
08:02 - like he had a really high reputation on
08:04 - stock overflow for like answering
08:06 - JavaScript programming questions that's
08:08 - how I found him he was just like a
08:10 - genius you know it just everything I
08:12 - would just give him like a bunch of
08:15 - tasks in Trello that uh that I couldn't
08:18 - I couldn't do and like you know the next
08:20 - week he would just have them all done
08:21 - completely you know perfect like so wow
08:24 - so two two of us felt like a year and a
08:26 - half or two years working on on Plexi um
08:29 - and getting it to a point where where we
08:30 - could release
08:32 - it and uh then I released it and it just
08:35 - kind of went dead you know so um that
08:39 - was kind of detering but I mean we spent
08:41 - like six months uh or like I mean I
08:45 - wasn't working with Elliott then after
08:46 - that but I on my own I spent like six
08:48 - months trying to like improve it and
08:51 - continuing to develop it and and like
08:53 - talking with some customers who are
08:54 - still using it but
08:56 - um yeah overall it was just like really
08:58 - hard to get traction and uh you know
09:00 - retain users because like that whole
09:03 - industry is so uh competitive you know
09:05 - there are so many prototyping tools
09:07 - coming out every other
09:09 - day um then eventually just out of the
09:13 - blue uh morat from Marvel app reached
09:16 - out to me and said that they were um
09:19 - thinking about building a similar tool
09:22 - um but like rather than start from
09:24 - scratch that they would just acquire
09:25 - Plexi and and bring us on board so that
09:28 - was really cool so that's what happened
09:31 - then yeah well tell us a little bit
09:33 - about the acquisition process uh I would
09:35 - imagine a lot of the developers and
09:37 - designers who are watching this uh
09:39 - haven't actually been
09:42 - acquired like that's that's like uh very
09:45 - few startups are acquired it's probably
09:47 - like maybe two% or something of them
09:50 - actually make it to that level uh so
09:53 - what was that process like of being
09:56 - having your product integrated into
09:58 - Marvel app and joining the Marvel app
10:00 - team yeah I mean that was that was
10:03 - really cool the whole thing was
10:05 - completely new to me
10:07 - because I guess like the best part about
10:10 - it was that it was validation you know
10:13 - it was like because right up until that
10:16 - point I had no idea what I was you know
10:18 - I had no idea if I was on the right
10:20 - track or if I wasn't and you know I
10:22 - guess I was just like everyone else just
10:23 - like just working away slugging away um
10:26 - trying to learn new skills and not
10:29 - really seeing anything come of it you
10:32 - know unless of course if you're working
10:33 - for a job but um then like when when my
10:38 - startup got acquired it was like wow
10:40 - maybe I am doing something right you
10:42 - know and so yeah that was cool me the
10:45 - guy the guys at Marvel acquired the
10:47 - startup and then brought me and Elliot
10:49 - on board the guy that I I was working
10:50 - with in New York so the two was uh join
10:53 - the team at Marvel and you know spent
10:55 - about a year and a half there
10:57 - integrating Plexi into their
11:00 - platform um which is now called canvas
11:02 - Marvel canvas um I I mean it's been re
11:06 - since then it's been rebuilt from the
11:07 - ground up in uh in
11:12 - canvas um in like H 5 canvas
11:18 - um uh with the guys on board like like
11:20 - and rebuild and react uh so yeah I mean
11:23 - that was cool awesome so they took your
11:26 - prototype uh or I guess your fully
11:28 - functioning app use it as kind of a
11:30 - prototype for the full refactor to react
11:33 - app and H exactly yeah exactly I mean
11:36 - initially it was released as a beta um
11:40 - and it's I mean it was kind of like as a
11:42 - test initially I guess the first launch
11:44 - to see to see what people be interested
11:46 - in this it was because Marvel the way
11:48 - Marvel app works is that um you upload
11:52 - images like you design your your screens
11:53 - in sketch or photoshop and then upload
11:55 - images and then you can piece them
11:57 - together using Marvel apps platform
11:59 - um so Marvel canvas was like the first
12:02 - step toward having an in-house like a
12:04 - buil-in way that you can draw your own
12:06 - images now um so I mean the guys are
12:09 - still developing that and I believe that
12:11 - they're pretty pretty close to their
12:13 - first release awesome we can we can
12:16 - definitely uh look for that in the
12:18 - future so you went from just to recap
12:22 - you went from a high school student uh
12:24 - who was primarily focused on learning
12:27 - music music theory composition
12:29 - uh you did that for a number of years
12:31 - then uh you did graphic design I guess
12:34 - working with print and and learning that
12:37 - aspect of design and then you transition
12:40 - into web design you learn to code U and
12:44 - then you built a product you built many
12:46 - products but one of them was acquired
12:48 - and you worked on that for two years and
12:50 - now uh you're working as a
12:52 - freelancer and you wrote an amazing
12:55 - extremely popular medium article
12:57 - recently about the notion of Design
13:00 - Systems and I've linked to it below for
13:02 - anybody who hasn't read this article you
13:04 - should absolutely check out column's
13:05 - article but can you describe what a
13:08 - design system is real quick and perhaps
13:12 - contrast it to a design framework for
13:15 - example a CSS
13:16 - framework yeah um yeah I mean I've been
13:20 - going back and forth on like various
13:22 - definitions I'm not really sure myself
13:24 - what exact the best way to describe it
13:26 - but in in my article I said a design
13:29 - system is an evolving set of rules
13:32 - governing the composition of a product
13:34 - so it's like it's basically everything
13:37 - from your your pallets you like your
13:40 - color palets you you know Shadows all of
13:43 - the the values that you apply to the
13:45 - properties that make up you know the
13:47 - styles that make your company look like
13:49 - your company and not like other
13:51 - companies um you know coupled with the
13:54 - components that you have like buttons
13:55 - and
13:56 - inputs which would be your UI toolkit I
13:59 - guess um coupled with like um you know
14:02 - larger components um and then compos
14:05 - like screen
14:06 - compositions um plus like code
14:10 - guidelines um you know naming
14:12 - conventions for files and and and for
14:15 - like code I
14:17 - guess and plus like rules like uh for
14:21 - for like when to use this button when to
14:23 - use that input when to use this heading
14:26 - and when not to use this font size um
14:29 - you know rules that like that govern how
14:32 - your developers and designers should
14:34 - compose screens you know using using
14:36 - your code base and using your
14:38 - design um and and that applies like
14:42 - across platform you know not just on web
14:45 - not just on mobile but like you know on
14:47 - your entire Suite of
14:49 - products so yeah I mean that's that's
14:51 - what I mean at least when I say design
14:53 - system so really the design system is
14:56 - like the central document that governs
14:59 - all the other design documents it's like
15:00 - the master design document yeah I guess
15:03 - I guess you pull it out here yeah and do
15:06 - you know of any organizations that have
15:08 - this kind of like master plan for design
15:11 - that that they've actually taken it to
15:13 - that level where they're they're kind of
15:15 - doing full systems design
15:18 - thinking
15:20 - um I mean honestly it's like it's very
15:23 - very rare uh I mean I mentioned in my
15:27 - article that design systems are becoming
15:29 - much more popular um which is great to
15:32 - see I mean everyone there are tons and
15:34 - tons of articles about Design Systems
15:36 - there are like tons of people linking to
15:38 - books and resources about Design Systems
15:40 - lots of job post lots of companies are
15:42 - posting job
15:44 - listings like and setting up teams
15:47 - specifically for uh for Design Systems
15:49 - design system roles um but in terms of
15:54 - like like seeing products that are you
15:58 - know rolled out with like complete
16:00 - completely integrated design systems
16:02 - that are up to date it's very rare you
16:04 - can see them and I guess like best
16:06 - examples would be Google Google's
16:08 - material design which is like a super
16:11 - super comprehensive design uh
16:14 - system H
16:16 - guidelines and another great example
16:18 - would be
16:19 - Airbnb yeah who they do tons and tons of
16:22 - work on Design Systems and design system
16:25 - tooling uh I believe they've got an
16:27 - in-house team and specifically for
16:29 - Design Systems so I mean yeah that's
16:32 - another company another company would be
16:34 - intercom who are as far as I'm aware
16:37 - they're just setting up a Design Systems
16:39 - team but they really I I chatted with
16:42 - with some of the guys at inter intercom
16:44 - and I mean they really seem to to
16:46 - understand the importance of Design
16:47 - Systems and like how
16:50 - um they really like how you know how
16:53 - important it is to to approach design in
16:55 - a systemic way you know rather than just
16:58 - like sporadically but like things like
17:00 - even things like tool kits like uh
17:03 - Foundation or or bootstrap you know even
17:06 - though they have like bootstrap has like
17:08 - comprehensive documents on how to how to
17:12 - work with the bootstrap
17:14 - toolkit but you know it's not it's not
17:17 - coded or designed in a really systematic
17:19 - way like for example take the button
17:22 - component um like it it displays the
17:25 - button component it shows you what it
17:26 - should look like and it shows you how to
17:28 - use code but it doesn't go as far as to
17:31 - say like how should this button look on
17:33 - a dark background or you know on a blue
17:37 - background it doesn't it doesn't take
17:39 - into account the actual pragmatic uses
17:42 - of a design system you know when you
17:44 - actually go to build a website you know
17:45 - almost 100% of
17:47 - websites will have some alternate
17:49 - background color and each of your
17:51 - components should be able to function on
17:53 - that background color you know if they
17:55 - are supposed to you know some components
17:56 - should never be used on a certain
17:58 - background color um and if you look at
18:00 - various websites like
18:02 - um not I don't want to be knocking any
18:05 - anyone's work but like if you want like
18:08 - I'm always open to constru just
18:12 - thinking Mar auto works at GitHub and he
18:15 - built bootstrap but
18:17 - um there they recently rolled out a new
18:20 - header a new nav like a dark nav and I
18:24 - was looking at I was looking at CSS and
18:25 - it's like they've styled the input
18:28 - specific to the dark header so it's like
18:31 - elsewhere in the code base they've said
18:33 - here's what our input looks like but in
18:35 - this specific location we're going to
18:36 - hack it to make it look some like some
18:38 - like differently because it's on a
18:40 - different color background and we didn't
18:41 - think about that earlier on when we were
18:43 - designing our design system so I think
18:46 - like that's for me that's like the
18:48 - essence of Design Systems thinking like
18:51 - everything you
18:52 - do stop for a second before you do it
18:55 - and think where exactly will this
18:57 - component be used and how will it be
18:59 - used and like and what it it's not going
19:01 - to be used in just one way you know we
19:02 - need to consider all the different ways
19:04 - that this component is going to be
19:06 - used yeah so in many ways it's it's just
19:09 - a an extension of design thinking and
19:12 - and systems engineering kind of Concepts
19:15 - the notion that you should slow down and
19:18 - think in a whole systems way whenever
19:19 - you're making a change so that you don't
19:21 - end up with a whole lot of bolted on
19:23 - functionality and a lot of exactly yeah
19:26 - oneoff stuff yeah yeah yeah and like I
19:29 - mean the the thinking is when you're
19:31 - doing a one-off change the thinking is
19:33 - oh it's just a oneoff but like if you
19:34 - look at 90% the Cod bases they're like
19:37 - they're just made up of tons of oneoff
19:40 - changes yeah there's always that that
19:42 - joke about um like this is temporary or
19:45 - something like that like and then you
19:47 - look at Mid history and it's from like
19:48 - years ago yeah always treat any code
19:51 - changes as though they're going to live
19:53 - on
19:54 - forever I mean look if you look at like
19:57 - Microsoft so I'll talk in ter terms of
19:58 - code because that's what I know but if
20:00 - you look at like Microsoft Windows for
20:02 - example the reason the code base gets
20:04 - huge you know bigger and bigger and
20:06 - every release is like an extra gigabyte
20:08 - or two um is because they're worried
20:12 - about breaking stuff and changing stuff
20:14 - so instead it just it just creeps and uh
20:18 - for example a function that would
20:19 - normally take like two parameters has
20:22 - these other 20 parameters nobody's brave
20:25 - enough to remove them
20:29 - exactly yeah I mean you see that all the
20:30 - time yeah yeah and CSS I guess so you
20:35 - let's step back and talk a little bit
20:36 - about how you research these things
20:38 - because it sounds like you spend a lot
20:39 - of time just going and looking at
20:40 - websites and inspect element and digging
20:43 - into the
20:44 - CSS it sounds sad but that's most of my
20:48 - life so do you think that that's an
20:50 - extension of your kind of self-taught
20:52 - ethos um you know you you learn music on
20:54 - your own you learn design on your own
20:57 - without formal training uh certainly not
20:59 - formal academic training do you think
21:01 - that's just kind of a reflection of how
21:03 - you
21:04 - learn I I definitely think so I think so
21:09 - because I'm not sure I'm not sure if I
21:12 - gravitated towards those
21:14 - um those Industries or those types of
21:17 - jobs because of some innate personality
21:19 - tra I have or because I gain this innate
21:22 - personality trade from working in like
21:25 - so many of these types of jobs I'm not
21:27 - sure which which way it went but uh but
21:30 - certainly there are tons of Parallels
21:32 - for example between like the work I did
21:34 - in music and the work I do now in design
21:37 - for
21:39 - example um like distilling distilling
21:43 - down a song like into tiny little
21:45 - Snippets of Music um and then like
21:48 - storing them so I can you know I can
21:50 - refactor them until they're perfect you
21:52 - know nothing's ever perfect but until
21:54 - until I'm happy with them and then like
21:56 - reusing them throughout the song and
21:58 - um and it's exact same with code you
22:01 - know like like distilling down a UI into
22:04 - tiny little reusable components and even
22:06 - for down into tiny little reusable
22:08 - Styles and uh you know refactoring those
22:10 - until they're perfect and then reusing
22:12 - them throughout the whole UI
22:14 - um but yeah um sorry what was the
22:17 - question just we were just kind of
22:20 - riffing on uh oh the nature of is it a
22:22 - reflection of the way you learn um just
22:25 - kind of this ad hoc like let's yeah gu
22:28 - in the real world and and I mean that is
22:31 - how I learned initially I just um like
22:34 - even in print that's how I learned I
22:35 - would just take a poster and I would
22:36 - just try and copy the poster um but like
22:39 - when I was learning web design I
22:41 - remember like going to Facebook and
22:43 - trying to copy their their blue header
22:45 - nav and you know and I would just I
22:47 - would just inspect element for ages like
22:49 - and try and copy the color and then try
22:51 - and rebuild it myself without having
22:53 - Facebook
22:54 - open so yeah I mean that's that's like a
22:56 - huge part of How I Learned just just
22:59 - like drilling away at something until it
23:01 - was perfect
23:03 - and I mean I guess that's why that's
23:06 - that's that's why I I went so deep into
23:08 - Design Systems because constantly when I
23:10 - was when I was building websites um I
23:13 - would just constantly run into this
23:15 - problem where I you know designed my
23:18 - input component for example and like
23:21 - thought it was perfect and then when I
23:23 - actually went to build a number of
23:25 - different screens with that UI component
23:27 - I would always have to tweak it and
23:28 - change it and like hack it into place
23:30 - like to make you know some margin fit or
23:33 - resize it for a sidebar or you know
23:36 - change the background color to put it
23:38 - into a header knv or and I always I just
23:41 - got to wondering like am I doing
23:42 - something wrong here or like is this
23:44 - what like all websites do and it turns
23:47 - out that that is how most websites
23:49 - handle it they just hack it into place
23:51 - but I just always thought like there was
23:53 - something I was missing and and I
23:56 - finally realized yeah like I mean I was
23:59 - just doing half the work all the time I
24:01 - was just doing half the work and then
24:02 - like neglecting the whole like
24:05 - neglecting the other half of the work
24:07 - and all my components were like only
24:09 - Built 50% they were just built for a
24:11 - white background and that was it and I
24:13 - had no actual I wasn't I wasn't baking
24:15 - in any understanding of how these
24:18 - components will be used in the real
24:20 - world I was just coding them for like uh
24:23 - so they looked good on dribble or
24:24 - something you
24:25 - know so I mean yeah I mean
24:28 - definitely well I understand uh that
24:30 - you're working on a new project right
24:33 - now uh I think you mentioned that you
24:36 - were working on some sort of CSS
24:38 - framework or tool
24:40 - yeah it's called call BM you know For
24:43 - Better or Worse what's it called bantom
24:47 - bantom okay what does bantom mean is
24:51 - that like a a
24:53 - noun I hate naming things so badly but
24:57 - uh it's you know Bantam weight you know
24:59 - like the you know the fight weight
25:01 - divisions Ah that's where I've heard
25:03 - that before better weight or Bantam
25:04 - weight or heavyweight you know so it's
25:06 - like I I named it Bantam because like
25:08 - Bantam is a really lightweight Division
25:10 - and at the time years ago when I started
25:12 - it I was I was just trying to like um
25:16 - build the smallest set of reusable style
25:20 - classes that I could build that I could
25:23 - just use to build almost any
25:25 - website and it weighed like you know
25:28 - three or four kilobytes after
25:30 - compression um so I call it bantom wow
25:34 - since then since then it has evolved
25:35 - into a full-blown to tool
25:38 - kit so it's not so bantom anymore but
25:41 - it's I mean I'm not changing the name
25:43 - because I hate naming things that's a
25:45 - good name it's it's very I mean I didn't
25:47 - know what Phantom weight was but now
25:49 - that you explain it like an excellent
25:51 - synonym for
25:54 - lightweight which it sounds like that
25:56 - was certainly one of the goals is just
25:57 - performance and not being a heavy Tool
26:00 - uh like bootstrap keeps getting bigger
26:01 - and bigger for example u a lot of the
26:04 - other popular Frameworks are getting
26:06 - bigger and bigger uh how do you how do
26:08 - you prevent so one of the things we've
26:10 - been talking about is the fact that
26:12 - you're doing like when you just build
26:14 - the component without thinking of the
26:15 - context is going to be used in you're
26:17 - really only doing half of the work
26:18 - you're always going to be encountering
26:20 - Corner cases that you need to update
26:22 - your entire design system to reflect and
26:25 - and Encompass um
26:29 - how do you keep a tool lightweight when
26:31 - you know that there's going to be that
26:33 - uh kind of evolutionary trial and error
26:36 - process yes so I mean right now I'm I'm
26:39 - I'm in the midst of of building out
26:42 - Bantam I'm trying to get ready for V1 um
26:46 - and what I'm doing is just taking each
26:48 - component one at a time and I'm I have
26:51 - like a test a couple of test um screens
26:55 - so I'm building like a really complex X
26:58 - email screen you know something like U
27:02 - mailbox was you
27:04 - know um and I've got a marketing uh
27:08 - screen that I'm building out and I've
27:10 - got another like statistics based web
27:13 - app screen that I'm building out so I'm
27:15 - every time I I make some do some
27:18 - progress on on one of the components I
27:20 - test it out in these screens in each of
27:21 - these screens and I make sure that it h
27:24 - it fits and it works in all in each of
27:26 - the different contexts that it's to be
27:27 - using
27:28 - eventually um I mean obviously these uh
27:32 - these three screens won't Encompass
27:34 - every single use case for all of these
27:36 - components but I mean I'm never going to
27:39 - you know be able to solve everyone's
27:41 - problems so um I mean I mean I'm happy
27:44 - I'm happy with uh just testing it in
27:47 - those three screens and so it's like you
27:49 - know those those three different screens
27:50 - have different color backgrounds they
27:52 - have like some sometimes the component
27:54 - is in a sidebar sometimes it's in a nav
27:57 - sometimes is in your main content and
28:00 - sometimes like an input is coupled with
28:02 - a button sometimes an input has an icon
28:04 - inside it there's just so many different
28:07 - variations on each component and um as
28:09 - I'm building out the pages I'm going
28:11 - back to the components then to like you
28:14 - know make sure that they that all these
28:17 - um contacts are baked into the
28:22 - components how soon do you think you'll
28:25 - have like a a alpha lease uh the people
28:28 - can play
28:30 - with uh I mean well people could start
28:32 - playing right now it's on it's on GitHub
28:34 - Bon um I have it on mpm uh and I have it
28:39 - hosted on S3 so you could start playing
28:41 - playing around with it right now but
28:43 - it's uh it's I mean obviously it's
28:45 - heavily in flux but I'm hoping to have
28:47 - like V1 ready in maybe three weeks four
28:50 - weeks something awesome and so once you
28:54 - have that V1 out is is are you going to
28:56 - try to keep the name spacing consistent
28:59 - so that it doesn't like so you don't
29:01 - break backward compatibility for future
29:03 - versions or is that a is that a concern
29:05 - or are you just gonna people are gonna
29:08 - be I mean I haven't this is like this
29:10 - would be my first h i mean this is my
29:12 - first open source project that anyone's
29:14 - taken any interest in I mean it only has
29:16 - 100 stars on GitHub but it's like
29:17 - infinitely more than anything else I've
29:19 - ever worth on um so I don't have too
29:22 - much experience working on open open
29:24 - source projects um haven't even
29:27 - contributed to many open source projects
29:29 - so I'm not I'm not entirely sure exactly
29:31 - how it works or what's what the best
29:32 - practices are but uh from what I gather
29:36 - just from reading some articles on it um
29:39 - I don't think I want to be too concerned
29:41 - with versioning
29:43 - um because it just becomes this
29:46 - nightmare of like you know dealing with
29:48 - support requests and things like that
29:50 - right um I
29:52 - think I think
29:55 - like I think after I release the V1 the
29:58 - next uh step would be to Port it to
30:02 - react um and like maybe using CSS
30:06 - modules or style components or something
30:08 - like that but uh after that I guess like
30:12 - the main
30:13 - changes for in each version would just
30:15 - be visual you know like updating the
30:17 - components so that they they you know
30:20 - they look modern you know so so the
30:23 - whole framewor doesn't end up looking
30:24 - really
30:25 - dated you know aside from that I can't
30:28 - imagine changing too much or at least
30:29 - I'm hoping not to have to change too
30:31 - much I guess we I guess we'll find
30:34 - out yeah I mean that's a good problem to
30:36 - have if a whole lot of people are using
30:38 - your product and and giving you feedback
30:40 - for sure well I'm I'm going to recommend
30:43 - everybody who's watching this uh read
30:45 - that article again that you wrote about
30:47 - Design Systems uh you should all follow
30:50 - colum on Twitter and check out his
30:52 - personal website which I discovered is
30:55 - hosted on netlify which is a pretty cool
30:58 - new static page uh hosting
31:02 - service and uh I'm GNA also put a link
31:05 - if you have a link to your GitHub repo
31:07 - I'll put a link uh into the the notes
31:10 - below as soon as we end the stream and
31:13 - everybody go check it out if you think
31:14 - it's cool give it a
31:18 - star cool well thank you so much uh
31:22 - colum for taking time out of your uh St
31:25 - Patrick's Day Friday
31:29 - evening no problem thank you thanks for
31:31 - having me it was fun yeah it was a
31:33 - pleasure and uh I'm looking forward to
31:36 - hearing updates on how banto goes and
31:39 - and I'm very excited to if you get a
31:42 - chance to write about it I'd love to
31:44 - read it and I think our community would
31:47 - love to read about the evolution of this
31:49 - framework as well yeah yeah I've got
31:51 - some articles planned um yeah some plan
31:53 - to write some some new stuff on it after
31:55 - it's released
31:57 - all right well thank you again have a
