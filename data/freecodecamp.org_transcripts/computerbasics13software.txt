00:01 - hi in this video we're going to talk
00:03 - about the basics of software we've
00:05 - already covered hardware which are parts
00:07 - of the computer that you can actually
00:08 - see and feel with your hands
00:11 - software are the programs that run on
00:13 - the hardware you can't pick up a piece
00:15 - of software you can pick up a piece of
00:17 - hardware with the software downloaded
00:19 - onto it but software is the code that is
00:21 - written and imprinted onto hardware
00:25 - the two main types of software that
00:26 - we're going to talk about are the
00:28 - operating system like windows mac or
00:30 - linux those are the main three you're
00:32 - not really going to get any more than
00:34 - that or applications now everything that
00:38 - you think of as software probably falls
00:40 - into these two
00:42 - spaces especially the applications
00:44 - applications cover everything from your
00:47 - web browser to games to things like
00:49 - photoshop or your mail how you edit
00:52 - documents
00:53 - every type of system application that is
00:56 - not an operating system
00:58 - is
00:59 - just a regular software application
01:02 - the big takeaway from this video is that
01:05 - hardware is what you can actually hold
01:07 - on to from a computer but software
01:09 - consists of all the programs that you
01:11 - can run on that hardware
