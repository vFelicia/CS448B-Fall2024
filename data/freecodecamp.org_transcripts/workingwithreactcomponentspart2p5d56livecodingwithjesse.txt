00:04 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:06 - with jesse i'm jesse
00:08 - and today i'm streaming from home
00:12 - i had some issues with the quality but
00:14 - then i turned off
00:16 - spotify the uh the desktop player and
00:20 - that seemed to fix the issues
00:23 - but uh if you have any issues
00:25 - let me know i'll do what i can
00:29 - um
00:30 - see
00:35 - sorry i just
00:37 - i just saw the uh the quality drop so i
00:39 - was just making sure like all right what
00:41 - else can i shut down here
00:44 - let me shed some more tabs
00:47 - in uh in chrome
00:52 - i thought i shot all of them down but
00:54 - then i noticed that on one of my other
00:56 - screens i still had some of them up that
00:58 - i i really didn't need
01:00 - let's see
01:03 - all right it's pretty good now
01:13 - okay cool
01:17 - so if you weren't here yesterday i'm
01:19 - gonna just go over briefly what we did
01:22 - because we're just gonna continue on
01:23 - with
01:24 - uh what we started yesterday
01:28 - so
01:29 - this would probably be best if you can
01:31 - see the code
01:33 - or an example
01:35 - so i'm going to switch over
01:37 - so you can see
01:39 - the code
01:41 - and let's start with an example
01:43 - i think that'll be best for now
01:52 - so here in the side menu we have
01:56 - sections
01:58 - and you can drop down
02:01 - these sections
02:02 - and see
02:04 - you know these links underneath here
02:06 - what i'd like to do though is make it so
02:09 - that
02:10 - these
02:12 - links inside of a section could also be
02:15 - drop-downs
02:16 - and have their own sub-menu items
02:20 - so
02:20 - yesterday we did a few things but
02:24 - what we ended with was that
02:26 - we divided up
02:29 - these links into having the link on the
02:31 - left side
02:32 - and then we have the section over here
02:34 - on the right side when you click it
02:36 - right now nothing happens
02:38 - right so we we wanted to leave it so
02:41 - that this side
02:42 - could still be a link
02:45 - oops
02:49 - and then the other side i don't know why
02:51 - that's just close
02:54 - i guess i accidentally clicked on
02:55 - something
02:58 - so then the other side would be an icon
03:00 - to indicate that you can
03:02 - uh drop down
03:05 - and have some more
03:07 - um some more options
03:10 - so
03:12 - i've changed some of the
03:17 - get this out data here
03:22 - so i've added in
03:23 - let me make that bigger there's no way
03:25 - y'all can see that
03:28 - uh
03:33 - there we are
03:36 - you don't need that for right now
03:41 - okay
03:43 - so
03:45 - in our data and uh for those of you who
03:47 - are new you can check out all this code
03:50 - online the link to the github repo
03:54 - is in the description below this video
03:57 - so right now
03:58 - we're in drawer menu.js
04:02 - and
04:04 - we've added i've added these sub menu
04:06 - items if you remember yesterday we were
04:07 - just saying sub menu true if we wanted a
04:09 - sub menu
04:11 - now
04:13 - we have
04:14 - uh an array of objects
04:18 - that will have the text the link url and
04:20 - then the as url uh if this looks weird
04:24 - to you
04:25 - uh it is weird you don't normally have
04:27 - to include this but to keep the
04:30 - client side routing
04:32 - working
04:32 - like we want it to
04:34 - we have to add this in
04:38 - so
04:41 - now we actually have some data we can go
04:43 - back into our component
04:45 - and we can map over this data and try to
04:48 - put in some some links
04:52 - so let's do that now
04:54 - so we won't really need to come back to
04:56 - this data
05:02 - we're going to be in
05:05 - let's see where component is
05:14 - so we're going to be in the components
05:15 - folder and we're going to select drawer
05:17 - item dot js
05:21 - so if you would like to check out the
05:23 - code that's where it's going to be
05:28 - and
05:34 - so here's where where we're at
05:40 - if you remember from from yesterday
05:43 - actually let me start my pomodoro clock
05:45 - so we can get started on on some of this
05:47 - coding
05:48 - um
05:50 - yesterday
05:51 - we added in an option
05:54 - uh where we had our sub menu item so
05:56 - before we were just
06:00 - saying
06:01 - let's see
06:04 - if there are
06:05 - submenu items
06:09 - then we want to render
06:11 - this collapsible
06:13 - section
06:16 - and then within there we were mapping
06:18 - over all the sub menu items and that
06:20 - data came from
06:22 - you know this this page that we have
06:24 - open over here
06:26 - this file
06:30 - and then we
06:32 - were displaying
06:35 - all of those links
06:37 - but now we added in
06:40 - an alternative so if that particular
06:43 - item
06:44 - has
06:45 - submenu items
06:46 - so even more
06:49 - some another sub menu inside of the item
06:52 - that is the sub menu so
06:54 - uh i guess that's a bit confusing
06:57 - but essentially we're having like two
06:59 - levels of of links possible here
07:03 - then we
07:04 - we're going to add in
07:09 - if and yesterday all the further we got
07:10 - was we added in another section
07:15 - where an icon could live
07:17 - that would be clickable what we need to
07:19 - do today is actually make add in the
07:22 - icon make it clickable
07:24 - and then when it's clicked
07:26 - we want to be able to display a whole
07:28 - another collapsible section
07:33 - so it's
07:34 - it's gonna get a little bit tricky
07:36 - uh but i think
07:38 - i think we can get through it
07:40 - today in today's stream uh given you
07:43 - know maybe like two uh two pomodoro
07:46 - sessions
07:47 - um
07:53 - let's see
07:56 - sorry i just got uh messages from my
07:58 - work slack so i was just double checking
08:00 - to make sure
08:02 - it wasn't an emergency
08:06 - okay
08:10 - let's see
08:15 - so i guess first thing we should do then
08:17 - is just just go for the icon so first
08:19 - step is let's actually display an icon
08:22 - second step is set up a click handler
08:26 - for that
08:29 - and then after that we'll worry about
08:31 - displaying the sub menu items
08:34 - so here we're just we're saying submenu
08:38 - that's not what we want right we want
08:40 - this
08:42 - click so let's see how we're doing this
08:47 - here
08:51 - um
09:02 - okay so we already have these expand
09:04 - more expand last
09:07 - icons
09:10 - so let's grab this
09:12 - for now
09:16 - and we'll put it down here
09:23 - and
09:26 - let's see
09:28 - we want to say
09:30 - is
09:34 - sub
09:45 - all right this is looks weird but it's
09:47 - gonna say is sub sub menu open
09:51 - i mean i'm not sure how to say that but
09:53 - it is
09:54 - a sub menu inside a sub menu
09:58 - uh so let's make sure we add that
10:01 - to our
10:03 - uh you know what we're gonna have to go
10:05 - up
10:06 - are we gonna have to go up let me think
10:09 - let me think uh no we won't
10:15 - so i think we're
10:19 - we're handling
10:23 - we're handling a lot of these
10:25 - in
10:26 - [Music]
10:27 - in the parent component
10:30 - but i don't think we would need to
10:40 - i don't think we need to do that
10:45 - all right let me know if anybody uh
10:47 - thinks otherwise but i don't think
10:49 - there's any reason why we need to move
10:51 - this up to the parent component
10:56 - let's see do we need it
10:59 - no we don't uh i remember now why we end
11:02 - up moving that because on the click of a
11:05 - um
11:07 - of these links
11:08 - we wanted to be able to open up a
11:10 - section
11:11 - so we needed to handle that in a parent
11:15 - component so that
11:17 - uh
11:18 - basically we could change the state by
11:20 - clicking on something in this app bar
11:22 - component
11:23 - and then that state could be passed down
11:26 - so that's why we did it so we don't need
11:28 - to worry about that so let's add in
11:30 - uh some state actually we could probably
11:33 - copy a lot of what we did
11:36 - for the component uh for the other
11:38 - component in here so let's do that
11:41 - that was it for
11:42 - like i think we did this in layout
11:45 - uh so
11:46 - let's copy let's just copy all the state
11:49 - from layout for now and then we'll
11:50 - remove what we need to remove
11:53 - and
11:59 - emissions
12:11 - okay
12:12 - [Music]
12:22 - okay
12:23 - yeah this should work uh so first let's
12:26 - copy that
12:27 - actually
12:30 - oh i thought i could copy it all in one
12:32 - go but this is for the drawer so
12:34 - um
12:36 - let's go back
12:41 - okay so we don't need this drawer
12:50 - i don't know that we need this either
12:54 - let's see
12:58 - it says expand item
13:04 - we will need this so let's copy this
13:08 - and
13:10 - move to drawer item
13:12 - and right now i'm just copying as we go
13:14 - through i'll explain more of what these
13:15 - do
13:16 - uh because you know we we did this
13:19 - a long time ago so
13:21 - uh many of you have joined the stream
13:24 - you know even with the within the last
13:25 - month or so
13:26 - uh probably won't remember
13:30 - uh how we did this
13:31 - so
13:39 - essentially we are
13:46 - getting the previous state
13:50 - uh and
13:52 - we're changing it to
13:55 - uh basically like the opposite of the
13:58 - previous state for the draw item so
14:02 - if it
14:03 - that's all i mean it it may look like a
14:05 - little more than you'd need for that but
14:07 - that's essentially what we're doing is
14:08 - we're changing
14:10 - the uh
14:11 - um
14:14 - the draw item basically from like open
14:17 - to close right i mean really you know
14:20 - pretty simple
14:22 - so let's go see
14:27 - how do we pass this in yeah it's going
14:30 - to be a little it is going to be a bit
14:32 - simpler
14:34 - because you see here
14:36 - we
14:38 - passed in to draw
14:40 - this expand item
14:42 - and then in drawer
14:52 - let's see
15:06 - so i'm trying to find i'm just trying to
15:08 - take you through the flow of this and
15:09 - see where it it's at input
15:13 - all right so we're below this
15:16 - okay so here's where we have our drawer
15:17 - item
15:20 - okay and this is where we're passing
15:22 - down that expand item
15:25 - okay we're also passing down
15:27 - the state
15:29 - to say whether or not
15:31 - this is open so it's this props drawer
15:34 - item drawer items about
15:37 - okay and if you remember we actually we
15:39 - had in the state for
15:41 - uh the app bar or i'm sorry for the
15:44 - layout
15:45 - in state there was an option in state
15:48 - called drawer items and then about
15:51 - was inside that uh so
15:55 - we had that for you know for each one of
15:57 - these we actually hard-coded these in
15:59 - since there's so few of them
16:01 - okay if we get
16:03 - many more than this we'll probably just
16:05 - map over the data stored somewhere else
16:09 - to save some space i mean that that's
16:12 - just those ones alone are probably
16:13 - taking up a fourth of this component
16:15 - right now
16:16 - so we may end up doing that to save some
16:18 - space but
16:20 - not not for this stream right now
16:22 - okay and then finally
16:24 - when we get to draw item we can see that
16:29 - that expand item and is open is also
16:32 - getting passed down
16:35 - so
16:36 - we see
16:40 - is open determines
16:42 - which
16:43 - [Music]
16:44 - um
16:46 - sorry it determines uh which icon that's
16:49 - the word i was looking for is going to
16:51 - be displayed
16:52 - so
16:54 - in this case do we want
16:56 - submit some something okay
16:58 - i just broke it because i
17:01 - i was in the middle of changing this so
17:03 - we won't be able to see it yet
17:08 - so basically is like is the the little
17:10 - arrow pointing up or down right that's
17:12 - that's what this was will do
17:14 - and
17:17 - if
17:19 - let's see
17:20 - there are some menu items
17:24 - then we are going to
17:26 - actually add all this
17:28 - you know collapse stuff uh for the the
17:31 - list
17:34 - let's see
17:35 - and actually for this well there's so
17:37 - many items
17:40 - yeah for this one there are sub-menu
17:43 - items for everything which is why
17:48 - we didn't really bother to add an
17:50 - alternative because that top level
17:52 - always has it
18:00 - so that's
18:02 - but inside of here we need another
18:04 - option so inside of here we've
18:05 - essentially done the same thing we're
18:08 - checking for submenu items or i'm sorry
18:10 - we're checking for a submenu on the sub
18:13 - menu items
18:15 - but we're we're having two options okay
18:18 - so
18:20 - we've already moved this um
18:24 - expand more expand less
18:26 - down here
18:31 - and that's why we've created the is sub
18:33 - sub menu open
18:38 - that was a longer explanation that i
18:40 - anticipated but essentially like that's
18:43 - that's what we want so
18:45 - let's go with the state and say
18:50 - um
18:57 - okay yeah we're not gonna have
19:05 - we're actually not gonna need these
19:07 - right
19:17 - yeah we're i don't think we will need
19:19 - any drawer items
19:34 - essentially
19:35 - i don't want to hard code these there's
19:37 - going to be way too many
19:39 - so
19:40 - that's what i'm saying like we don't
19:42 - really need drawer items
19:44 - i will put in
19:46 - like hey we you know we do have this
19:51 - but right now
19:53 - there's nothing in it so then what will
19:55 - happen is
19:57 - uh this will get
19:59 - added in
20:07 - so we'll probably need to rework this a
20:08 - bit
20:27 - all right actually
20:31 - we'll see if this automatically adds it
20:32 - in because this is within says state
20:37 - that's the behavior that i want is to
20:39 - automatically add add that in
20:42 - uh i'm going to check my time
20:45 - okay 10 minutes
20:46 - all right so we should have time to get
20:49 - basically to see something uh also what
20:52 - did i want
20:54 - i i totally forgot to add
20:57 - is sub sub menu open
21:04 - so we're gonna need
21:18 - let me think
21:23 - actually we're gonna need to pass this
21:25 - down
21:28 - will need this
21:30 - whoops and i didn't get everything
21:36 - so we'll need that
21:38 - and
21:42 - let's put it here on the grid item
21:45 - itself
21:46 - to give a bigger uh click area
21:51 - so
21:52 - it's unclicked expand item
21:55 - item id
21:58 - let's make sure yeah there we go expand
22:00 - item item id
22:02 - and then
22:04 - what we'll want here is
22:12 - think we're we're not going to do is sub
22:14 - sub menu open
22:16 - what we'll do is um
22:22 - we'll say drawer
22:27 - and i can't remember what it was
22:29 - draw items
22:33 - um
22:35 - dots
22:37 - or will draw items and then we'll say
22:41 - item id
22:45 - draw items item id
22:52 - and then we're going to check to see
22:55 - no that's it we should be able to check
22:57 - to see drawer items item id
22:59 - uh so let's
23:01 - go up here
23:04 - where we have this props
23:06 - and let's also make
23:08 - const
23:14 - let's say
23:22 - draw items
23:28 - this state
23:30 - okay
23:32 - and what else do you want no that's it
23:33 - for now
23:34 - um also item id is not going to work for
23:38 - us
23:42 - because item id is being passed down so
23:44 - the item id in this case would um
23:50 - would be talking about
23:52 - this
23:57 - this kind of upper level
24:05 - yeah so let's see so drawer is passing
24:07 - down
24:10 - item id and then we're manually passing
24:12 - down the id of about
24:15 - so we're we're not going to do that what
24:16 - we need to do instead
24:18 - of item id is say
24:23 - and this is only in that that interior
24:26 - that sub sub menu
24:27 - instead of item id we need
24:31 - um
24:32 - let's see what we want to do let's check
24:34 - our data for a second to see i mean we
24:37 - could use
24:41 - i suppose we could we'll just use the
24:43 - text then
24:49 - the item id will be will be the text so
24:52 - we'll say
24:56 - item.txt
25:10 - okay
25:16 - all right
25:17 - whoops
25:20 - uh
25:21 - wow that was not what i wanted there we
25:23 - go
25:24 - okay so
25:27 - this will probably be enough
25:36 - yeah this should be enough to just see
25:38 - the menu items now
25:40 - and it should fix any errors that we
25:43 - have so
25:45 - i think
25:47 - and while that's loading i check my time
25:49 - okay about five minutes
25:53 - make sure it loads okay good
25:56 - it's a good sign
25:59 - everything's just so slow when i stream
26:01 - from home it's just the
26:03 - you know my macbook is much less
26:05 - powerful than my imac
26:10 - okay so let's go
26:13 - here
26:14 - see what we have yay
26:16 - check it out
26:17 - okay so we have
26:20 - let's see
26:23 - so this
26:26 - just want to make sure so it doesn't
26:28 - affect
26:29 - this at all so our state separate which
26:31 - is expected that's what we wanted to
26:33 - happen now we have this
26:37 - whoops
26:39 - you know what we're gonna have to do we
26:40 - we
26:41 - i believe we have it set to auto close
26:45 - when this is clicked on
26:48 - so we're gonna have to change that
26:53 - but other than that i mean this is work
26:55 - and
26:57 - the alignment's a little bit off
27:02 - but other than that this is working
27:05 - so far all right so that was
27:07 - you know basically phase one was get the
27:10 - icon there
27:12 - and have it only show up if there were
27:14 - sub menu items so now step two is
27:18 - basically make something happen when
27:20 - that's clicked on so we're gonna add a
27:23 - uh a click handler
27:26 - and right now
27:28 - actually let's
27:30 - we should check the state
27:34 - so we should have
27:36 - because we did put the click handler on
27:38 - there so we should have something
27:40 - happening with the state
27:47 - you know we're gonna have to take so we
27:49 - have a on click toggle drawer
27:51 - for for these list items
27:54 - and um
27:56 - we
27:58 - really don't want that
28:02 - so for every list everything in the list
28:07 - we're toggling the drawer so what we
28:11 - we don't want that um what we want
28:15 - instead we want to remove these toggles
28:18 - from list
28:19 - and we want to add these toggles
28:22 - down to
28:24 - um our our actual
28:27 - um
28:29 - our actual
28:30 - a tag so
28:33 - actually we do we have the toggle
28:35 - drawing on this a tag
28:46 - interesting
28:51 - i think i'm gonna add them
28:55 - i'm gonna i want to add them here to our
28:57 - link and we should be able to
29:01 - remove them from the a-tag
29:09 - so we shouldn't really need it anymore
29:11 - uh and but then when we have
29:22 - yeah so this should work so this is now
29:25 - on the link
29:27 - but not on
29:30 - our
29:32 - our toggle here
29:34 - but then on this link
29:36 - let's add it
29:38 - here but not
29:44 - on the a
29:46 - the a tag
29:49 - okay
29:51 - let's see how that how that goes
29:55 - so let's wait for the refresh
30:06 - maybe
30:08 - let's manually refresh
30:14 - this will probably be the last thing we
30:15 - do uh for this pomodoro session then
30:18 - we'll take a break and i'll answer some
30:19 - questions in the live chat
30:28 - okay
30:30 - academics
30:33 - okay and when i click this it should not
30:35 - close
30:38 - wonderful but when i click this it
30:41 - should close
30:47 - automatically
30:49 - automatically clicks
31:01 - okay
31:03 - so i guess i broke it
31:12 - all right
31:39 - let's see we have this going here let's
31:41 - check this one
31:43 - huh yeah i have broken that
31:45 - functionality so we're gonna fix that
31:47 - when i come back when we come back we'll
31:49 - do a break now
31:51 - uh for questions
31:56 - and let me scroll up um
32:00 - phoenix says uh sorry for not being here
32:02 - yesterday but as promised i'm here today
32:05 - uh awesome awesome it's good to have you
32:07 - here

32:19 - good to have you back
32:38 - freddy says buenos dias
32:42 - buenos dias
32:44 - bienvenidos
33:06 - all right
33:07 - freddy's just speaking spanish and
33:12 - i'm trying to translate but my spanish
33:14 - is not great
33:16 - inn is here hey anna how's it going
33:18 - brooks here hey
33:27 - i might have to use google translate
33:29 - here
33:31 - let me
33:32 - maybe even google translate on my other
33:34 - screen
33:35 - and
33:37 - then that way i'll know i'll know for
33:39 - sure what you're saying
34:02 - okay cool so this is um
34:06 - something is learned every day
34:11 - uh let's see
34:14 - i need you to translate the rest
34:26 - okay so looks like freddy's saying i'll
34:29 - see you later
34:32 - it's 1 30 in the afternoon
34:36 - yeah freddy i think we're in the tam
34:37 - same uh time zone here because that's
34:39 - what time it is over here
34:50 - let's see
34:53 - phoenix says by the way i built will be
34:55 - starting reaction just curious is you
34:57 - kind of a subset of react
34:59 - uh so no actually so vue is
35:02 - a totally different
35:05 - library than react
35:08 - so
35:10 - they
35:11 - the end result is usually the same you
35:14 - know you're going to build a web app
35:18 - but yeah if you would reactor are
35:20 - totally different projects
35:24 - sorry about the yawn
35:27 - um
35:28 - yeah so if um
35:31 - you know some concepts i'm sure will be
35:33 - the same between view and react i
35:34 - personally have not used you so i can't
35:37 - tell you for sure
35:39 - you know what the biggest differences
35:40 - are and similarities
35:45 - um
35:46 - but yeah you
35:48 - i mean if you know react you're not
35:49 - gonna automatically know view so they're
35:51 - not they're not that you know close
35:53 - together
36:00 - uh and it says any plans for tomorrow
36:04 - um
36:06 - what's tomorrow thursday i'll be in the
36:08 - office tomorrow
36:10 - because i have a meeting
36:14 - and
36:16 - i think that's it
36:18 - i don't have any anything else planned
36:21 - i'm just gonna meeting i'm
36:23 - hopefully gonna do a stream and uh just
36:27 - just work on this um
36:29 - work on this website some more
36:33 - and then of course hang out with my
36:34 - family afterwards
36:38 - but uh all right so that was good timing
36:40 - i got to the bottom of the chat
36:46 - and there we go john asks one more
36:48 - question i have a strange chrome problem
36:50 - only on my own create rex create react
36:53 - apps i can no longer
36:55 - edit any styles in the dev tools all of
36:58 - them are grayed out style editing works
37:00 - in firefox and edge anyone
37:03 - wow
37:04 - i have never heard of that happening
37:10 - so i mean if anyone just come across
37:12 - that issue please let us know in the
37:14 - chat or in the comments of this video
37:17 - but yeah
37:18 - i've never had that
37:20 - i had it
37:22 - i don't know why i would be doing that
37:29 - well actually i don't know what's going
37:31 - on today but we have a lot less viewers
37:33 - than normal
37:34 - which is actually cool it's kind of like
37:36 - more chill
37:38 - uh
37:39 - when when we do it like this i feel like
37:41 - i have kind of freedom to spend more
37:43 - time
37:43 - on each question and then talking to you
37:45 - all individually
37:49 - but yeah i wonder what hap what happened
37:51 - is anything else going on like live
37:53 - right now
37:54 - or
37:57 - i don't know usually when this happens
37:59 - it's because like notifications didn't
38:01 - go out to people
38:05 - so that's a possibility
38:09 - i think i did do a stream during like
38:11 - some big conference that was live
38:13 - streaming before and i didn't get a lot
38:15 - of people then
38:16 - oh
38:19 - ricardo says zuckerberg at congress
38:23 - yeah
38:23 - all right i didn't realize that was
38:25 - still going on uh right now so
38:27 - if that's the case that that probably
38:30 - explains it
38:31 - i'm gonna go with that and not like
38:33 - nobody wants to watch my show
38:35 - so
38:36 - if they pick mark zuckerberg over me
38:38 - then i'll i'll understand that that's
38:40 - acceptable
38:43 - all right so
38:45 - started the next pomodoro timer will do
38:47 - one more
38:50 - and um
38:55 - i have just broken something that was
38:58 - working on this component so we did have
39:00 - it automatically shut the drawer when
39:03 - you clicked on one of these links now
39:05 - it's not working so let's figure out why
39:07 - it broke
39:10 - and
39:11 - try to get that that working and then we
39:13 - can move on
39:14 - you know to the to the next part
39:19 - okay so what i
39:21 - did was i removed
39:30 - actually this is interesting
39:32 - maybe
39:39 - let's see
39:42 - so obviously this does not work on the
39:45 - link tag itself
39:47 - maybe it it should be on the a tag which
39:50 - we removed it from the a tag
39:52 - oops
39:54 - yeah there we go okay so maybe it should
39:56 - be on the a tag and so we're going to
39:58 - put it back on the a tag
40:02 - and for this one and
40:05 - we're going to do the same thing here
40:07 - for this a tag
40:09 - and we're going to go ahead and remove
40:10 - it from these links since obviously it's
40:12 - not working on those links
40:14 - those link tags
40:17 - now we also removed it from the list
40:21 - i hope that it's not necessary to have
40:24 - it there
40:27 - we'll see
40:34 - i'm going to refresh so it will auto
40:36 - refresh eventually it's supposed to but
40:39 - everything's running so slowly i'm just
40:41 - going to refresh myself
40:44 - the thing that i don't really i i really
40:46 - like my my macbook pro but one of the
40:49 - things i don't like is uh the inability
40:52 - to upgrade it
40:54 - um you know very very much beyond what
40:56 - you get so
40:58 - um
40:59 - it would be nice if i could just keep
41:01 - this same macbook and then add more to
41:04 - it you know but uh
41:08 - at least the last time i checked i
41:10 - didn't think that was it was possible to
41:12 - do
41:17 - okay
41:21 - uh it's still not working
41:28 - hmm
41:36 - all right that's too bad
41:40 - all right so let's let's look a little
41:41 - deeper and see if we can figure out why
41:43 - it's not working
41:45 - all right so on click you want to toggle
41:48 - drawer
41:52 - why would it be
41:58 - working
42:01 - only sometimes
42:23 - oh well maybe we need to move it further
42:25 - up then
42:27 - uh let's take it from here and let's
42:29 - move it up to our grid item
42:35 - and see if that works
42:37 - uh i guess we could do the same here
42:41 - oops
42:46 - no i guess we can't do the same here
42:49 - because we have
42:50 - [Music]
42:53 - we don't have a grid do we
42:58 - have the link
43:00 - oh that's right yeah we didn't make
43:01 - these a grid item
43:03 - all right well let's just test it out
43:05 - i'm i'm not really hopeful that this
43:06 - will work
43:39 - hey
43:40 - all right so that worked
43:44 - for this one
43:46 - so when we click undergraduate
43:50 - great that worked but when we click
43:54 - graduate
43:58 - that didn't work so let's you know what
43:59 - let's move this back
44:02 - here let's move this back onto the link
44:05 - and double check to make sure that was
44:08 - not working
44:10 - and if we need to
44:13 - we can just wrap this in a div
44:16 - and then that may work
44:21 - all right so we'll wrap it in a div and
44:22 - then put the on click and on key down
44:24 - into the div
44:26 - we'll see
45:11 - ricardus is also champions league corner
45:14 - finals live
45:15 - oh well i mean i'm
45:16 - i'm up against mark zuckerberg congress
45:19 - and champions league so
45:22 - i mean i'd say i'm doing pretty
45:24 - pretty good with the 17 viewers that are
45:27 - here right now so
45:29 - for those of you that are watching thank
45:31 - you very much for choosing me over all
45:33 - that other stuff
45:36 - all right let's see
45:39 - can i shut
45:43 - nope all right let's make
45:49 - a div
45:50 - let's get rid of this
45:54 - let's make it
46:02 - add this in the dive
46:14 - save that
46:23 - refresh
46:33 - yes
46:56 - okay
47:02 - here we are
47:04 - that works let me click on another link
47:07 - there to make sure
47:08 - that um
47:12 - we're actually getting
47:15 - like the link part of it's actually
47:17 - working still
47:20 - okay and it is
47:21 - so the on click on that div to do the
47:25 - drawer works and then the um
47:28 - the actual link works
47:30 - wonderful
47:36 - all right great so now
47:39 - uh
47:41 - so we have
47:44 - the two separate areas
47:48 - a click on the link part
47:51 - closes the drawer and the link works
47:55 - but a click on the icon part
47:58 - does not close the drawer and it does
48:00 - not cause
48:02 - a
48:05 - a change in the page
48:07 - great so that's what we want so now
48:12 - what we do need here is
48:16 - click
48:18 - this expand item item text okay let's um
48:24 - we were gonna check to see what's going
48:26 - on with state
48:29 - so let's go into react
48:35 - it will open this up
48:37 - and
48:40 - this either one of these will work
48:44 - um
48:45 - actually
48:54 - this is just like
48:57 - nothing's working it's so slow
49:13 - uh let me refresh if i get it working
49:15 - again
49:42 - all right you know what
49:44 - let's just do it this way
49:52 - oh you know what
49:59 - i bet i'm calling this
50:04 - all right so let's say uh expand
50:07 - sub item
50:10 - and let's change this to expand
50:13 - sub item
50:27 - and
50:32 - i'm not saying
50:33 - my goodness
50:36 - this thought uh i made so many mistakes
50:39 - in here what is
50:43 - how did
50:46 - how did i not see all that was wrong
50:47 - with that when i first copied it over
50:49 - all right anyway
50:52 - let's see what what this gives us
50:54 - and
50:55 - it doesn't matter about dev tools over
50:58 - here let's just close that
51:14 - hmm
51:22 - okay not doing anything for there let's
51:24 - see
51:25 - um
51:26 - drawer items
51:41 - okay we're calling this
52:05 - we're just gonna console.log some stuff
52:09 - uh so since
52:11 - uh our
52:12 - react dev tools are not doing anything
52:19 - let's just use
52:21 - old-fashioned console logs
52:28 - let's make that a bit bigger
52:34 - actually waiting for this to load it's
52:36 - still spinning
52:40 - i think it hasn't loaded yet
52:45 - yeah this definitely hasn't loaded yet
53:04 - oh lots of stuff happening here he's
53:06 - shot right here
53:12 - okay
53:17 - okay
53:18 - i will fix this
53:20 - in a second
53:21 - let's see what we're getting in the
53:22 - console here let's just get rid of all
53:25 - this stuff okay
53:40 - okay so this is changing it's adding
53:42 - academically excellent true or false
53:44 - there we are okay so we are getting a
53:47 - change now
53:51 - uh i believe it's just the extreme lag
53:55 - for me trying to stream and you know run
53:58 - obs so there we are
54:00 - that is working just like we wanted to
54:02 - let's make sure it works
54:04 - uh with this other one as well
54:06 - independently
54:08 - yep it does work
54:22 - oh on a second
54:26 - no that's not the behavior that i really
54:28 - want
54:35 - all right let's go back and check
54:39 - see what what should be happening here
54:42 - is it it shouldn't be overwriting
54:44 - completely the previous
54:47 - the state here so it should keep
54:49 - whatever we set for uh the drawer items
55:00 - so what should happen is that everything
55:02 - that was there should be combined
55:07 - with this new
55:10 - this new state just for that particular
55:13 - item
55:19 - um
55:33 - i don't know what i'm doing wrong
55:38 - i mean obviously it's working
55:40 - um but let's see the problem
55:50 - all right so set that to open
56:14 - i guess it still works
56:35 - all right um yeah i'm not gonna worry
56:37 - about that i'm gonna leave the console
56:39 - log in to remind myself
56:42 - uh
56:43 - that it's not working exactly as i want
56:45 - so from a user perspective it is working
56:47 - but i would rather have that stay
56:50 - saved
56:55 - so
56:56 - but for now uh we have it working enough
56:58 - that we can add in
57:00 - this
57:01 - collapse
57:04 - so let's do this let's add in
57:10 - this
57:10 - collapse and
57:12 - the list
57:15 - into here
57:19 - so what we'll have
57:23 - let's see where we have that list
57:35 - all right so our list item is within
57:38 - there we don't want that
57:52 - all right so we're putting this after
57:53 - the list time okay
57:56 - so essentially we can put this after
57:59 - our link
58:00 - and it should still work
58:03 - no do we want it after the crib
58:14 - hmm
58:28 - i guess i'll just try it i'm not sure
58:31 - where this is gonna work
58:33 - the best
58:38 - i guess after this
58:44 - and then
58:45 - we need
58:50 - we need to close out this
58:59 - collapse
59:03 - okay and then within there we're gonna
59:06 - put
59:08 - these
59:11 - uh so we'll have links
59:16 - actually
59:19 - let's copy
59:20 - the links as we have them here
59:38 - okay since that's that's really how we
59:40 - we need them
59:42 - okay
59:44 - so within that
59:48 - oh shoot
59:51 - let's stop that for a second
59:53 - uh so
59:59 - let's see there we are so we need to map
60:02 - over these things first right
60:04 - so let's do
60:05 - um item dot sub
60:10 - menu
60:14 - uh dot
60:16 - map
60:19 - yeah that's how we're gonna do it okay
60:22 - uh so then we'll do sub
60:25 - item
60:31 - and then we can return
60:37 - this
60:40 - right
60:42 - yes
60:51 - but we need to change everywhere that
60:53 - says item
60:55 - we need to change to sub item
61:04 - there we go
61:16 - see why it's still giving me
61:18 - missing key prop okay
61:21 - missing key props let's see
61:24 - um
61:29 - oh because i move the key i just i need
61:31 - to move the key onto the div
61:40 - there we are
61:42 - and then i need to do that down here as
61:45 - well
61:47 - whoops
61:48 - let's move the key onto the div
61:52 - so when you
61:54 - are putting when you're mapping over
61:56 - something and you're inserting multiple
61:58 - elements uh with react they each need to
62:02 - have a unique key
62:04 - so that's that's why we're getting that
62:07 - error and we're also getting that same
62:08 - error in the console a few minutes ago
62:12 - and uh let's fix it up here as well
62:16 - so we have our key here on the link but
62:19 - really
62:20 - we should now put it here on our grid
62:25 - item
62:26 - since that's the um
62:28 - outermost
62:30 - uh item
62:31 - no actually it's not
62:34 - our outermost item is
62:39 - the entire grid the grid container so
62:43 - that's where we're gonna put it for that
62:45 - uh and my timer just went off so
62:48 - hopefully this works
62:54 - let's give it a refresh see if it works
62:57 - if it does work then
62:59 - that's great then we accomplished what
63:00 - we needed to
63:04 - there's still the issue of
63:07 - the alignment
63:10 - of those icons
63:12 - but other than that if this works uh we
63:14 - should be
63:16 - should be good
63:18 - should be mission accomplished for today
63:25 - nope submenu map is not a function i
63:28 - item that's something you know not all
63:30 - right let's see what we have going on
63:33 - here
63:35 - i believe that we did have
63:38 - sub menu items
63:40 - okay
63:43 - no no okay item dot sub menu yes so if
63:46 - item. oh i know
63:49 - i know what the problem is
63:51 - we still have that
63:53 - [Music]
63:56 - sub menu set to true at the top here
64:00 - so the the data type that it's expecting
64:03 - is
64:04 - an array but we were giving it a boolean
64:08 - so um
64:09 - that's why we had the error so let's try
64:11 - that again
64:40 - okay
64:42 - so i'm looking while this is loading i'm
64:44 - checking the live chat uh we were
64:46 - talking about how it's a lower than
64:48 - normal turnout for today's stream uh and
64:51 - um
64:52 - so number one there's there's several
64:54 - live events happening right now that
64:55 - could be that could be it uh phoenix
64:58 - also said
64:59 - you know a lot of people were here for
65:01 - this
65:01 - um
65:03 - for the css
65:05 - um
65:06 - continuously for act as in css
65:12 - okay so i think it's because not a lot
65:13 - of them have been here continuously for
65:15 - react as in css it was standalone so
65:17 - yeah maybe
65:18 - the few times that we did just css stuff
65:21 - that was pretty easy to understand stand
65:23 - alone so that that does make sense
65:25 - i did get
65:28 - very like above average turnout for that
65:33 - okay let's try it
65:41 - oh i know
65:43 - i know what i messed up
65:47 - uh
65:47 - [Music]
65:48 - okay when you're copying and pasting
65:51 - things it's
65:52 - it seems like it's easier to forget
65:54 - uh what you need to change
65:56 - so this collapse
65:59 - i'm trying to say like uh in is open and
66:02 - that's there is no is open now for this
66:06 - right
66:06 - um
66:07 - so let's see
66:16 - uh component
66:20 - li
66:26 - so instead of is open
66:29 - we instead
66:30 - want
66:32 - we want to use
66:38 - drawer
66:42 - items
66:46 - and then
66:48 - um what were we calling that
66:58 - oops no no no
67:01 - i'm editing the wrong one
67:04 - okay
67:05 - uh
67:07 - let's get down here to the right one
67:08 - [Music]
67:13 - there we are so we need
67:26 - drawer items and then
67:29 - item dot
67:30 - text
67:32 - okay so this will
67:34 - look in state
67:36 - for the drawer items and then it will
67:38 - find the value of the drawer item that
67:41 - has a key
67:42 - of
67:44 - this particular
67:46 - item
67:47 - in that list
67:59 - okay
68:02 - one more refresh if this doesn't work
68:05 - uh i am i'm just gonna go back to the
68:08 - questions because i think i'm out of
68:10 - ideas and so i'll have to look up some
68:13 - stuff
68:26 - carlos said didn't remember about the
68:28 - champions league see you later jesse
68:31 - of course uh you're just kidding so
68:38 - all right
68:39 - let's give it a try now
68:50 - yay all right cool it works
68:53 - awesome um
68:55 - i don't think any of these links
68:57 - actually work yet
68:58 - i could try it but i think it's going to
69:00 - take us to a page that doesn't work
69:02 - okay but it was cool it actually did uh
69:05 - shut the drawer
69:06 - which is what we wanted
69:09 - so
69:10 - even though the page does not work yet
69:13 - that's still still very cool
69:22 - awesome
69:27 - all right cool so that works so
69:29 - uh basically
69:31 - the only thing that needs to be done
69:34 - for this to be completely finished
69:37 - uh would be
69:40 - just some some alignment thing so
69:43 - uh right now i would want this and you
69:46 - could probably see it better like this
69:47 - so
69:48 - right now it's this is aligned to the
69:51 - top
69:52 - of the container i'd want it to the
69:54 - middle so it lines up with this text
69:57 - and then once we open up these submenu
70:00 - items
70:01 - you can see the indentation is all wrong
70:04 - it's actually at the same level as the
70:08 - the top level
70:10 - list items we would want it to be
70:13 - and then at another level and
70:15 - potentially even have
70:17 - a lower font weight
70:20 - so
70:22 - that'll need to be fixed uh while we're
70:25 - doing that probably what i'll end up
70:26 - doing is bumping these back
70:29 - even further
70:31 - to make space
70:32 - for this other level so essentially the
70:34 - third level which are these ones will
70:36 - end up being at this point
70:38 - and then
70:39 - this will bump back this will bump back
70:41 - and then that way you'll have you'll
70:44 - have this so it should make space for
70:47 - everything
70:48 - uh like that and
70:52 - so that's
70:54 - uh
70:56 - excuse me
70:58 - so i'll work on that
71:00 - and then in terms of the data i will
71:02 - need to go through now
71:04 - and add in sections to the data
71:07 - uh so that we have all those submenus uh
71:10 - where we need them
71:17 - all right so there's only a few more
71:18 - comments in the uh in the chat so if you
71:21 - have a question go ahead and put it in
71:22 - there now
71:23 - but i'm just going to go through these
71:24 - last few comments and um and then we're
71:27 - going to finish up the stream
71:30 - and john says console log is a game
71:31 - saver for me even in react yeah for sure
71:34 - i mean i
71:35 - occasionally i'll see like a tweet or an
71:38 - article saying that you you should never
71:40 - use console log
71:41 - and
71:42 - i don't know i mean to me sometimes a
71:45 - really simple debugging issue just it
71:48 - makes sense to use something really
71:50 - simple
71:51 - uh maybe if i knew more about the other
71:54 - ways to debug
71:56 - maybe it would be easier for me
71:58 - but you know throwing in a console log
72:01 - is just
72:03 - it's so easy and i'm so used to it
72:06 - you know it definitely
72:08 - you know
72:09 - i would need a good reason to use
72:11 - something else
72:15 - and it works
72:19 - uh
72:21 - nikki says uh find myself also console
72:24 - logging all the time
72:26 - the chrome debugger and vs code is so
72:28 - powerful though i haven't learned to use
72:30 - it yet
72:31 - yeah same with me i just
72:34 - there's there's so much in um
72:38 - visual studio code that i i don't know
72:40 - how to use i'm learning new stuff about
72:41 - it all the time
72:42 - mainly from you all
72:45 - uh phoenix says hey jesse what exactly
72:47 - does yarn do also do you know any
72:50 - package that gives me terminal
72:52 - functionality within sublime text just
72:54 - like we can see in visual studio code
72:56 - here
72:56 - um i don't know of any packages for
72:59 - sublime because i've never used sublime
73:01 - text
73:02 - so i have no idea if anybody uses
73:04 - sublime and knows of a package that
73:07 - will allow you to use an integrated
73:08 - terminal
73:09 - uh please uh let us know in the chat or
73:12 - in the comments
73:14 - uh and then in terms of yarn yarn does
73:17 - exactly the same thing that npm does
73:20 - uh
73:21 - when it first came out
73:23 - it was claimed that it could do
73:26 - at least two things better than npm one
73:28 - it was faster and two
73:30 - it came with this lock file
73:32 - um that
73:34 - kept all the
73:37 - essentially it it's um
73:40 - gave you greater control over like
73:42 - exactly what um
73:44 - what was going on with all your your
73:47 - packages
73:48 - right so they would
73:50 - um
73:51 - you would save your log file to your
73:53 - github repo and then everybody else
73:54 - would use that same log file so
73:57 - now npm also has its own lock file and
74:00 - it is faster as well so i don't know if
74:03 - yarn has any advantages now or not
74:06 - over npm
74:07 - i just got used to using it after
74:10 - shortly after it came out
74:13 - and so that's why i still use it
74:18 - albert says can you make a react redux
74:22 - and firebase website portfolio when
74:24 - you're finished with this series uh this
74:26 - one is a bit too much for me
74:30 - uh usually so albert usually what i do
74:33 - is whatever i have to do for my job
74:36 - so
74:38 - uh we'll see we'll see what comes up
74:41 - next i imagine whatever i do next is
74:43 - probably going to be less
74:45 - uh difficult than what i'm doing now
74:49 - because they're just smaller sites
74:52 - so we'll see
74:58 - sorry
74:59 - um
75:01 - yeah i'm not 100 sure what my next
75:03 - project is going to be but i think it
75:05 - will be
75:07 - less involved
75:11 - nikki says uh should also make the
75:14 - drawer bigger on desktop
75:17 - yeah i can definitely do that i hadn't
75:19 - thought about that before but that's
75:21 - that's a
75:22 - possibility
75:24 - um
75:25 - john says it's true nikki at larger
75:28 - media with a percentage can work better
75:31 - than a set pixel width
75:34 - okay cool yeah i would
75:36 - i think i'd like to use a percentage
75:38 - with a max width
75:40 - so i would never want if somebody's
75:42 - using an extra wide screen i would never
75:44 - want the sidebar to be like really
75:45 - really big
75:47 - so maybe i can combine
75:50 - uh some media queries with a percentage
75:52 - with and a max width so like i never
75:54 - want it to be
75:56 - larger than like let's say 400 pixels
75:58 - wide
75:59 - um
76:02 - and then
76:03 - percentage-wise as well i would never
76:06 - wanted to take up more than let's say i
76:09 - don't know eighty percent of the screen
76:15 - yeah
76:16 - something like that
76:17 - which i mean it's pretty crazy that it
76:19 - would take up 80 but still like
76:22 - i think
76:29 - so maybe
76:34 - uh actually i could see a case for a min
76:36 - a max and min with
76:41 - off to think about it but that is a good
76:42 - point so i mean essentially like i'd
76:44 - never want it to be below 300 pixels
76:47 - and probably not above 400 pixels
76:53 - and then on a desktop i mean it could
76:55 - reasonably take up 20 percent of the
76:57 - screen
76:58 - at least and be okay
77:03 - mobile's tricky
77:07 - i liked
77:09 - actually i could probably use a
77:10 - percentage on mobile and that would be
77:12 - okay so like i'd never wanted to take up
77:14 - more than 80 percent of the screen
77:16 - um
77:18 - with the minimum
77:22 - being at
77:23 - 300
77:25 - yeah
77:27 - it's the smallest phone screen with is
77:30 - 320 pixels i think
77:36 - yeah anyway i'll um
77:38 - i'll have to test it out and think more
77:40 - about that uh in pixels so
77:43 - i mean for now that'll probably be
77:44 - something that it's like
77:46 - if i can get to it i will but it's not
77:48 - necessary before launch because
77:51 - it works as it is
77:57 - all right cool phoenix says it's just
77:58 - like buttons we don't want them to get
78:00 - squeezed nor blowed up yeah exactly yeah
78:03 - that's exactly the case it'll look
78:06 - it there has to be this medium thing
78:07 - it'll look terrible if it's squeezed
78:09 - together and it'll look terrible if it's
78:10 - too big so uh we just gotta find the
78:13 - right
78:15 - the right range that's acceptable
78:19 - okay all right well i think i'm gonna
78:20 - finish up with the stream now
78:23 - uh so i've got through the live chat
78:25 - thank you all so much for watching and
78:27 - for choosing me over mark zuckerberg and
78:29 - uh champions league
78:31 - really appreciate that
78:34 - um
78:35 - i should be back tomorrow i'll be in the
78:37 - office tomorrow i do have a meeting in
78:40 - the morning
78:42 - i don't think i have any other meetings
78:44 - so i sh it should be good tomorrow for a
78:46 - stream
78:47 - and um
78:50 - i'm not exactly sure what we'll work on
78:52 - tomorrow so it'll be a surprise
78:56 - um
78:57 - yeah so
78:59 - have a wonderful day
79:00 - uh thank you all again for watching
