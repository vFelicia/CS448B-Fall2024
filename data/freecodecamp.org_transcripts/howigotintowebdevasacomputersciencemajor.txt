00:00 - now you can get started
00:01 - all right so
00:02 - hello everyone my name is chris uh
00:04 - i'm kind of new to this meetup so most
00:07 - of you probably haven't seen me before
00:08 - or i've seen me around and haven't
00:10 - really talked to me um
00:12 - and so i'm currently studying computer
00:14 - science at ou and i kind of you know
00:17 - noticed a general theme that
00:19 - for free code camp
00:21 - and you know just around here in general
00:23 - a lot of people didn't seem to
00:26 - finish or either didn't finish computer
00:28 - science in school or
00:30 - are coming from a different field so i
00:32 - just wanted to give
00:34 - kind of
00:35 - how i got started in web dev
00:37 - studying computer science in college
00:40 - so
00:42 - just so you know where i'm coming from
00:43 - i'll just go a little bit over
00:46 - uh kind of my
00:47 - my college history here
00:49 - kind of what i did before i started
00:50 - coming to the meetups
00:53 - so
00:54 - i was born and raised in canada the land
00:57 - of
00:58 - canadian geese
01:00 - and mice
01:01 - maple syrup stuff like that
01:03 - and after i finished high school in 2012
01:06 - i moved here to oklahoma to live with my
01:08 - mom and i thought it'd be nice to
01:10 - attend college in the states
01:12 - so since we lived really close to edmund
01:14 - i decided to attend
01:16 - uco and i started studying uh was
01:20 - electrical engineering there
01:23 - and i did that for my first two
01:24 - semesters and that was when i had my
01:26 - first programming and
01:28 - computer science experience
01:30 - at their engineering computing class
01:32 - which was a required class for all the
01:35 - engineering
01:36 - disciplines
01:37 - and they
01:39 - taught that class in c
01:41 - and so after my two first two semesters
01:43 - i decided i wanted to do um
01:46 - something more related to computers so i
01:47 - switched to or transferred to uco or ou
01:51 - which is where i am now and studying
01:53 - computer engineering
01:55 - and here the computer engineering
01:57 - curriculum is basically the same as
01:59 - computer science for the first
02:01 - two years or so
02:03 - so i went through all their
02:05 - other java courses
02:07 - and
02:08 - i studied abroad for a year uh in 2015
02:12 - and i came back last year uh september
02:14 - of last year and that's when i decided i
02:17 - didn't want to really want to work with
02:18 - hardware i wanted to focus more on
02:20 - computer science and so now i'm fully
02:22 - computer science major
02:23 - so i'll probably stick with this one
02:25 - don't know yet fingers crossed
02:28 - so uh let's go into how i got started in
02:32 - web dev
02:33 - so
02:34 - i didn't learn any you know html css
02:36 - javascript in school
02:38 - so my first experience was actually an
02:40 - internship
02:41 - um i got the internship through a
02:44 - personal connection through my mom
02:46 - and
02:48 - it was an internship at a company which
02:50 - is somewhat uh notorious around here
02:52 - apparently that no one likes
02:56 - ala mode
02:57 - and if you don't know what um ala mode
02:59 - or what they do they sell software for
03:01 - real estate agents appraisers mortgage
03:04 - brokers
03:05 - and they
03:07 - one of their products is basically
03:09 - custom websites for these agents and
03:10 - brokers hosted on their custom cms
03:13 - system
03:15 - and so
03:16 - my job as a intern was
03:19 - their system was running on a legacy
03:21 - flash system you know you had all these
03:23 - fancy animations
03:25 - you could add sound effects things like
03:28 - that and so they were trying to redis uh
03:30 - you know revamp that and use bootstrap
03:33 - so what they had in the past was
03:36 - basically this kind of it might be a
03:38 - little bit hard to see but it's like
03:39 - basically a rich text editor right you
03:40 - could put in text lists
03:43 - tables images things like that and it
03:45 - would you know compile it into html
03:49 - and
03:49 - you know that works great for you know
03:51 - simple text like that and just gets
03:54 - injected into this page that looks like
03:55 - that you know your top bar
03:57 - is all sidebars all loaded in with flash
04:01 - you could put in you know sound effects
04:03 - when you hover over each button makes
04:05 - like a laser gun sound like
04:07 - it's really bad
04:09 - but anyway so
04:11 - with simple content like that lists and
04:12 - paragraphs that is pretty easy for it to
04:14 - generate but once you um
04:17 - start adding in
04:18 - you know old
04:20 - uh sorry let's just start adding in
04:22 - styling to the text like no bolding
04:24 - coloring different layouts right you
04:26 - start getting uh you know
04:28 - stuff like that you know weird font tags
04:31 - everywhere empty strung tags and spans
04:35 - so if you've ever had the misfortune of
04:36 - working with this kind of html i'm sorry
04:40 - but
04:41 - basically they had a lot of their
04:42 - default content pages were you know
04:45 - either laid out with tables or it was
04:47 - laid out um or had lots of you know font
04:50 - tags laid out everywhere and so it's
04:52 - basically my job to turn code that looks
04:54 - like that into you know just like that
04:57 - right the bootstrap
04:59 - framework it already styles all of your
05:01 - default components right so you don't
05:03 - need anything there and so if you have
05:05 - this it looks consistent in all the
05:07 - sites and it'll be updated by any you
05:09 - know site-wide themes that the customer
05:12 - may choose
05:14 - so i was thinking about demoing some of
05:16 - the things i built so i worked on this
05:17 - for about two two weeks
05:19 - i transferred all their content pages
05:21 - into clean html before i started
05:23 - building some actual template pages that
05:25 - customers could buy
05:27 - i was going to demo them but maybe we'll
05:29 - save that for the end if we have time
05:33 - so how did learning computer science in
05:35 - school
05:37 - you know actually helped me in this
05:39 - internship
05:41 - i
05:42 - well
05:43 - i okay well
05:44 - it didn't really help directly it
05:48 - um so let me explain right so at ou um
05:51 - if you if you've taken class at ou
05:53 - you'll
05:55 - you'll find out really quickly that ou
05:56 - is mostly a java school right most of
05:58 - their for um yeah most of their classes
06:01 - you know for the better part of your
06:02 - degree you'll be working with java for
06:04 - all of your classes now you have maybe a
06:06 - few classes here there that uses
06:08 - something else but for the most part
06:10 - it's java
06:11 - and i think you know that
06:13 - that while java is a great language you
06:15 - know it's got a robust api it's got you
06:17 - know good type safety stuff like that
06:20 - the students can get locked into
06:22 - thinking rather than thinking how can i
06:25 - write this in code it becomes how can i
06:27 - write this in java and so you get kind
06:29 - of locked into that mentality of how
06:33 - to write software and code
06:35 - and so
06:37 - um some of the things that i wish that i
06:40 - knew
06:40 - when i was at the internship
06:43 - and just you know in general that they
06:45 - didn't teach
06:46 - this is by no means an exhaustive list
06:49 - but
06:50 - essentially they i would have wished
06:52 - that they taught me how to code better
06:54 - right so just
06:55 - general um
06:57 - learning different languages right i was
07:00 - you know using java basically the whole
07:02 - time i was there
07:03 - except for one class
07:05 - and
07:06 - good programming practices so things
07:09 - like
07:10 - how to write clean code how to put in
07:12 - proper comments
07:14 - there was if you follow the medium the
07:16 - free code camp medium blog there was a
07:18 - post about
07:19 - a week and a half ago
07:21 - called putting comments into code uh the
07:23 - good the bad and the ugly by a certain
07:26 - bill sorry i'm sorry if i said that name
07:28 - wrong and basically details how
07:31 - it's important to put comments into code
07:33 - but you should do it in a way
07:35 - that is helpful and there are things you
07:37 - should and shouldn't do and so they
07:39 - never really taught us that they just
07:40 - said put comments in your code or else
07:42 - we'll take marks off something like that
07:45 - so
07:46 - building projects right
07:48 - in a way when you do your assignments
07:50 - it's kind of like building a project
07:52 - but
07:53 - they don't
07:54 - in the end it's still a class assignment
07:57 - right you just want to get it over with
07:59 - and once
08:00 - once you've done it you just
08:03 - kind of toss it off from the side you
08:05 - know you don't really want to look at it
08:06 - anymore and so you're not really
08:08 - encouraged to go back and improve on
08:10 - your projects any further um not and
08:13 - taking the next step
08:15 - and finally is application of theory so
08:19 - if you go into the data structures class
08:22 - at ou and you'll ask them
08:23 - have you built um a binary tree data
08:27 - structure
08:28 - before they'll say they'll probably say
08:30 - yes because that was their last
08:31 - assignment in the class and you know
08:34 - they have built it but if you ask them
08:36 - you know when would you use a binary
08:38 - tree to store data instead of you know
08:41 - an array a stack linked list
08:44 - they
08:45 - they may not really be able to tell you
08:48 - maybe they'll tell you some of the
08:49 - advantages but
08:50 - not really how or in what situation you
08:52 - would use them
08:54 - so that was learning
08:56 - how to code and another big thing was
08:59 - version control
09:01 - so git and github is
09:04 - you know pretty essential for
09:06 - working in groups and collaborating with
09:08 - others
09:09 - and
09:10 - and just for keeping track of your
09:11 - homework and make sure you don't lose
09:12 - your progress so
09:14 - uh
09:16 - they don't really teach this in any any
09:17 - of the classes they
09:19 - um i asked a friend before who took the
09:22 - classes
09:23 - a few semesters before he said that no
09:25 - they didn't teach it but in my human
09:28 - computer interaction class
09:30 - the professor attempted to explain to us
09:33 - how to use git
09:34 - now i say attempted because i don't
09:35 - think he succeeded
09:37 - if you walked into that class not
09:39 - knowing how to use git you came out
09:41 - still not knowing how to use git and you
09:43 - were probably even more confused about
09:44 - what it was from before
09:47 - so
09:48 - yeah i think that that would have been
09:50 - um a nice thing to learn you know maybe
09:52 - freshman or sophomore year as you're
09:54 - getting into working on your projects
09:56 - and keeping track of your progress
09:59 - and
10:00 - lastly you know relating to version
10:02 - control and github you know
10:03 - collaboration a lot of your assignments
10:05 - you know they tell you to do it on your
10:06 - own right and so that kind of
10:08 - discourages you from
10:10 - copying from others cheating
10:12 - and all the you know academic
10:14 - integrity stuff like that
10:17 - but when you do that you're kind of
10:20 - you don't really get to
10:22 - experience working on a software project
10:25 - as a team
10:27 - um you know when you just think of work
10:29 - on group projects in school in general
10:30 - to say okay you do this i do that and
10:33 - we'll just put all together when we're
10:34 - done and that doesn't really work
10:37 - all the time with software especially
10:38 - when
10:39 - you go into a job and you have to work
10:41 - on the team
10:43 - and the team
10:44 - you may not always get to meet the team
10:46 - right they may be working remotely
10:47 - things like that
10:49 - so learning collaboration
10:51 - um would have been a good thing to know
10:54 - i believe they teach um i believe you
10:56 - have a bit more group work
10:58 - later on the degree in the last year of
11:00 - study but
11:02 - not so much in the first three
11:05 - now with that being said there were
11:06 - things that um that did help and i did
11:10 - find useful
11:12 - and the first thing was i got used to
11:15 - coding right so when you do all your
11:16 - assignments you know you
11:18 - you code you do your assignments and so
11:20 - when you get to the job
11:22 - it doesn't really feel
11:24 - all that all that foreign and you know
11:28 - it
11:30 - you get used to having you know other
11:31 - students and your professors look at
11:33 - your code and so compared to maybe
11:35 - someone who is always learning on their
11:36 - own didn't really get a chance to show
11:38 - other people their code
11:40 - i kind of feel like that helped me there
11:44 - um next thing was
11:47 - i now find learning a new programming
11:49 - language not
11:50 - you know not that bad
11:52 - um i said you know most of my classes
11:54 - were taught in java the data structures
11:57 - class was taught in c plus and so the
12:00 - professor never really went over much
12:02 - more than you know how to assign
12:03 - variables how to you know write a
12:05 - function just basic syntax and
12:08 - all of the
12:09 - all of the quirks of the language we
12:10 - were left to you know figure out for
12:13 - ourselves you know things like pointers
12:14 - stuff like that
12:16 - and so
12:17 - the important part was that you
12:19 - understood the fundamentals
12:21 - of programming right like in most
12:23 - languages you'll have a for loop or a
12:25 - while loop on if statements and once you
12:27 - understand that all you really need to
12:29 - do is go look up the syntax rather than
12:31 - having to figure out
12:33 - how do
12:34 - for loops work in this language because
12:36 - they all work you know more or less the
12:38 - same way
12:41 - and finally how to search for help
12:43 - right working on
12:46 - assignments
12:47 - really forces you well i mean doesn't
12:50 - force you but i had to google for help a
12:52 - lot right how to go on stack overflow a
12:54 - lot
12:55 - and look up you know a variety of things
12:58 - and
12:59 - when i was at my internship i don't
13:01 - think i mentioned this earlier but i
13:02 - didn't study any html before i went to
13:04 - the internship so web dev wasn't even a
13:07 - thing that i had considered before that
13:10 - so i had to look up stuff you know every
13:12 - day
13:13 - for the first week or two when i was
13:14 - just learning html
13:16 - on the fly
13:18 - so i think these are the three things
13:19 - that
13:20 - really helped me while i was there
13:24 - so i think i've gone on long enough so
13:26 - just to wrap up
13:27 - um
13:29 - learning computer science didn't really
13:31 - directly help me
13:33 - there were things that kind of you know
13:34 - made it easier but
13:37 - nothing directly helped because you know
13:39 - i was working with html and css maybe a
13:41 - little bit of javascript and they didn't
13:43 - teach that at school i mean why would
13:45 - they
13:47 - so
13:48 - my main message here is don't worry if
13:50 - you're not a computer science major or
13:51 - if you you know stop studying cs
13:54 - it's not a big deal especially when
13:56 - you're working in something like front
13:58 - end web development where it's more
14:00 - about the design and
14:02 - you know building pages rather than
14:04 - worrying about how to sort of
14:07 - sort an array efficiently or how to
14:09 - balance a binary tree you know
14:12 - and
14:14 - what's important remember is just you
14:15 - know the fundamentals how to write clean
14:17 - clean code how to
14:18 - use version control how to collaborate
14:20 - with others working on you know big
14:22 - projects
14:25 - and
14:26 - yep that's it for me
14:28 - and yeah feel free to contact me if you
14:29 - have any questions
