00:00 - hello my name is beau carnes and i run
00:02 - the freecodecamp.org
00:04 - youtube channel we're currently the
00:06 - biggest active software channel on
00:09 - youtube our channel focuses on posting
00:12 - long in-depth courses and we post these
00:15 - courses from a variety of contributors
00:18 - in this tutorial i'm going to share
00:20 - insights into youtube's algorithm
00:22 - i'll share tips for creating your own
00:25 - software youtube channel and we're going
00:27 - to hear advice from a variety of
00:29 - successful youtube creators even if
00:31 - you're new to software you can benefit a
00:33 - lot from starting a youtube channel in
00:36 - fact most of the tips and advice i share
00:38 - in this video will be applicable to any
00:40 - type of youtube channel not just
00:42 - software channels
00:44 - i think starting a youtube channel can
00:46 - benefit developers at any stage of their
00:48 - career you don't have to be an expert
00:51 - you don't even have to know anything
00:52 - about a topic to teach someone about the
00:54 - topic all you have to have is an
00:56 - interest and a desire to learn actually
00:59 - that's just what i did when i started my
01:01 - first javascript training channel
01:04 - so i created my own youtube channel this
01:06 - is before free code camp and i had
01:09 - javascript tutorials i didn't really
01:11 - even know that much about javascript
01:13 - before i started the channel
01:15 - i would learn about the topic so i could
01:17 - make a video about the topic and the
01:20 - process of making the videos turned me
01:23 - into an expert and then when i went to
01:25 - get a job i was able to point to my
01:27 - videos to show that i knew what i was
01:29 - doing and it helped me get a job
01:33 - before you start a channel you need to
01:35 - decide the goal of your channel
01:37 - your goal can have an impact on a lot of
01:39 - things about your channel
01:41 - so here are some common goals which are
01:43 - not mutually exclusive
01:45 - some people want to help others learn
01:47 - you may want to build a body of work
01:49 - that will lead to other career
01:50 - opportunities
01:51 - you may want to give yourself a reason
01:54 - to learn
01:55 - or maybe promote a paid resource
01:58 - maybe you just want to make money
02:00 - through youtube ad revenue sponsorships
02:02 - and affiliate links also you may want to
02:04 - promote your brand or company when
02:07 - thinking about the videos you want to
02:08 - make on your channel and you may think
02:10 - about how there's already a lot of
02:12 - videos on the exact same topic but don't
02:14 - worry about that because there are tons
02:16 - of different learners in the world so
02:18 - there's got to be a learner out there
02:19 - that can learn best from your teaching
02:21 - style
02:22 - also when i can't stress this enough
02:24 - you don't have to already know about a
02:26 - topic to create a video about a topic
02:29 - creating a video is a great opportunity
02:30 - to learn
02:33 - you're going to want to try to figure
02:34 - out what type of software channel you
02:35 - want to start
02:36 - i categorize software youtube channels
02:38 - into four types
02:40 - we have tutorial
02:43 - informational
02:44 - live coding
02:46 - and software entertainment
02:49 - i'm going to give some examples of all
02:51 - of these interspersed with tips from
02:53 - some of the creators different types of
02:56 - channels different types of videos
02:57 - appeal to different demographics for
02:59 - instance a software entertainment
03:01 - channel is going to appeal to a wider
03:03 - demographic than a software tutorial
03:05 - channel
03:06 - so you need to keep your goals in mind
03:09 - so you don't get discouraged if you see
03:11 - other videos getting way more views in
03:13 - your videos just depends on what you're
03:15 - trying to accomplish for your channel so
03:18 - a tutorial channel primarily features
03:20 - software tutorials
03:22 - this is the best type of channel if you
03:24 - want your channel to help you get a job
03:26 - or if you want to sell paid courses
03:28 - this style is sometimes less focused on
03:31 - your personality than other channels
03:33 - so you can see here some
03:35 - top tutorial channels and some good
03:37 - examples of what tutorial channels are
03:39 - like
03:40 - so as far as tips
03:43 - i
03:43 - people ask me this all the time and i
03:45 - really i don't want to say i don't like
03:46 - the question but
03:48 - i don't feel like i have a great answer
03:51 - because there's no special formula i
03:54 - didn't do promotion so i don't i don't
03:56 - have much advice on promotion what i did
03:59 - was just
04:00 - make videos i just was i was consistent
04:03 - i think that's the best advice i can
04:05 - give is to be consistent
04:07 - and it's going to be discouraging at
04:09 - first you're going to get no views you
04:11 - know and you're going to make no money
04:13 - and you you're spending your time but
04:16 - the more consistent you are if you if
04:18 - you're making good content and you're
04:19 - uploading you know every week
04:21 - people are gonna start to come so
04:24 - that's that's the the best advice i can
04:26 - give
04:27 - and
04:28 - don't stop because if you stop making
04:30 - content your channel is just going to go
04:32 - to and even at my level at whatever
04:35 - 800 000 subscribers if i if i don't make
04:37 - a video for a month or two months
04:40 - my analytics are just gonna it's just
04:42 - gonna be a straight down slope um and
04:45 - it's very stressful you know doing
04:47 - youtube
04:48 - especially full time is very stressful
04:50 - because if you
04:52 - if you don't have any ideas that week
04:54 - you know and you can't make a video your
04:56 - your analytics go down and that's your
04:58 - livelihood you know so it can be
05:00 - stressful but you do you know you want
05:03 - to be consistent
05:04 - uh another thing is
05:06 - be yourself don't don't try to copy
05:08 - people it's it's okay to watch other
05:10 - people and get ideas from them but don't
05:12 - like straight up copy someone because
05:14 - it's already out there you want to be
05:16 - unique you also don't want to be fake i
05:18 - know that there are a lot of fake people
05:20 - on youtube and a lot of them are
05:21 - successful like the family vloggers and
05:23 - stuff that are all giddy and happy and
05:25 - stuff and then they're miserable off
05:27 - camera uh you want to be yourself you
05:29 - know
05:30 - for me
05:32 - i i like to talk to you guys like i talk
05:34 - to my friends you know i don't jump on
05:37 - camera like hey guys we're gonna we're
05:39 - gonna build an application today and and
05:41 - lottie died and that's just not my
05:43 - personality you guys would think i was
05:45 - freaking high or something you know is
05:46 - it getting back on drugs if i if i acted
05:49 - like that so i just think that being
05:52 - yourself is
05:54 - is genuine and people pick up on that
05:56 - and i think that ultimately that's one
05:58 - of the things that that's helped me out
06:00 - the most and then the last one i have is
06:03 - to find your niche and basically what i
06:05 - mean is
06:07 - keep your content
06:09 - you know all in the same area don't do
06:11 - a development video or a tutorial one
06:14 - day and then the next day do your
06:16 - favorite movies and then the next day do
06:18 - a family vlog because
06:20 - people tend to subscribe to channels for
06:22 - a specific thing for me it's usually
06:25 - tutorials
06:27 - i also do videos on you know like videos
06:30 - like this self-help to help you in your
06:32 - professional life help you be more
06:34 - successful
06:36 - come up with ideas stuff like that
06:39 - you know so you want to just kind of
06:41 - stick to to a certain realm don't go all
06:44 - over the place because people won't know
06:45 - what to think of you or why they're
06:47 - watching you unless you just have a
06:49 - fantastic personality and it doesn't
06:51 - matter what you do there are some
06:53 - channels like that but i've seen a lot
06:55 - of channels fail because they just
06:57 - they're just all over the place so you
06:59 - know you just want to find find what
07:01 - you're good at and stick to it
07:04 - an informational channel has
07:06 - informational videos about software
07:08 - development
07:09 - they usually focus on soft skills and
07:12 - other information that developers should
07:14 - know
07:14 - and just you know sometimes you see
07:17 - multiple styles in one channel you'll
07:18 - see tutorial videos and informational
07:21 - videos on the same channel
07:23 - but here are some examples of some good
07:26 - informational channels to kind of give
07:27 - you an idea of what type of videos
07:29 - you'll see on those channels hey guys
07:31 - this is your boy joe back at it again
07:33 - codingphase.com your boys back and adam
07:36 - did it again one more time listen people
07:38 - love it people hate it it is what it is
07:40 - what do i do here on youtube
07:42 - very simple okay i just come here be
07:44 - myself i talk to you guys just like i'm
07:47 - talking to my friends okay i'm just
07:49 - having fun with it okay that's the
07:51 - number one thing that i do on youtube
07:53 - have fun okay second thing is i actually
07:56 - help people get jobs
07:58 - by giving them advice and and telling
08:00 - them the things that help me okay and
08:02 - even things that i've seen in the
08:04 - industry that i feel like nobody told me
08:06 - so i should tell others about it so like
08:09 - that they can be more prepared for job
08:11 - interviews uh you know what type of
08:13 - programming languages that you focus on
08:15 - how to get into certain jobs right how
08:18 - to make your life easier as a junior
08:20 - developer and that's what i do here
08:22 - right it's a informational
08:24 - slash you know tutorial slash you know
08:28 - lifestyle type of channel okay if you
08:30 - like the type of content then definitely
08:32 - check out coding face right because
08:34 - that's what we do here we we try to help
08:36 - people out and at the same time
08:38 - you know we just let people know like
08:40 - what we do okay and how we have seen
08:42 - growth you know we went from parking lot

08:47 - warehouse doing all this other stuff all
08:48 - the jobs that you could think of right i
08:50 - see people all the time come up and be
08:52 - like man i'm an uber driver hey i'm
08:54 - doing uh deliveries i'm doing this and
08:56 - that and i'm like bro
08:58 - at the end of the tunnel there's a light
09:00 - trust me i saw it right i learned how to
09:02 - code i did everything that i needed to

09:06 - get there too okay now by the way for
09:09 - anybody that wants to get into this
09:11 - whole system this whole world this
09:13 - ecosystem of youtube my advice is be
09:16 - yourself don't copy from anybody okay

09:21 - think that should be the number one
09:22 - thing for everybody because i'll be
09:24 - honest with you youtube is not easy
09:26 - right it's a lot of hours a lot of work
09:28 - that you have to put in right don't kill
09:30 - yourself over it but you know have fun
09:33 - with it okay don't take things too
09:35 - serious sometimes we overthink things
09:37 - you know when i first got into youtube
09:40 - i've been doing this for like four years
09:42 - before i was even starting to get into
09:44 - youtube right but because i was so
09:47 - worried about what are the people going
09:49 - to think about me or do i sound smart
09:51 - enough or is this a topic that i can be
09:54 - talking about now i don't care now i
09:56 - just come in and have fun okay and
09:58 - that's my advice to you guys just come
10:00 - in have fun enjoy yourself don't copy
10:03 - from what other people are doing right
10:05 - if you do that you're going to be
10:06 - successful it might take you a little
10:08 - bit longer right but it's not about
10:10 - getting the numbers up it's not about
10:12 - getting a million subscribers not about
10:14 - having you know a whole bunch of money
10:16 - it's not about that it's about having
10:18 - fun like one thing that i can tell you
10:20 - guys on my community is we have fun we
10:23 - do live streams and we have fun we enjoy
10:26 - ourselves you have a long day of coding
10:28 - right you want to come home you want to
10:29 - relax that's what we do at
10:30 - codingface.com we give you advice we
10:32 - help you out but at the same time we
10:34 - make sure that the subscribers have fun
10:36 - and if you want to get into youtube
10:38 - right that's what you should do whoever
10:40 - it is if it's five people 10 people
10:42 - that's watching you have fun with those
10:44 - 10 people okay that's just how it is at
10:46 - the end of the day you will become
10:48 - successful in just how anything else in
10:50 - life is right you put in the time and at
10:53 - the end the reward is there all right so
10:55 - anyways guys shout out to everybody that
10:57 - you know supported me here on
10:59 - freecodecamp and love you guys man stay
11:01 - tuned if you want to check out my
11:02 - channel check it out codingface
11:05 - another type is live coding this type of
11:07 - channel mainly focuses on people live
11:10 - coding viewers can see the actual
11:13 - thought process that goes into creating
11:14 - a program
11:16 - it can also be helpful to see how live
11:17 - coders solve problems in real time
11:21 - although some people are so good at it
11:22 - it can almost seem as polished as a
11:24 - tutorial channel
11:26 - like for instance the coding train
11:28 - live coding is great for building a
11:30 - community because you often get to
11:32 - communicate with viewers directly during
11:35 - a stream
11:36 - and this is also a style that you
11:39 - commonly see live coding with other
11:41 - types of styles on the same channel
11:44 - so if you're interested in live coding
11:46 - i've learned a few things
11:49 - been live coding for a few years
11:51 - and here here's some of the advice that
11:54 - i think it'd be most helpful on the
11:57 - technical side don't worry about getting
11:59 - a fancy microphone or webcam
12:01 - you can use the built-in webcam
12:04 - to get started and the built-in mic
12:06 - that's how i got started and i stuck
12:08 - with that for a long time before i i got
12:10 - anything else and no one ever complained
12:12 - about the audio or video quality
12:15 - when you actually do start
12:17 - start live coding
12:20 - i recommend just live coding whatever
12:22 - you're you're normally doing whatever
12:24 - you're comfortable with if you're doing
12:25 - a tutorial you can live code that uh if
12:29 - if you're working on open source
12:31 - projects live code that
12:33 - it it doesn't have to and it doesn't
12:35 - have to be something you're really good
12:36 - at
12:37 - say if you just want to do a side
12:39 - project with some new technology
12:41 - you can you can do that
12:44 - when you are
12:46 - actually doing the live coding
12:48 - do your best to explain what you're
12:49 - doing
12:51 - i recommend
12:52 - setting aside a specific time for
12:54 - questions
12:55 - uh for checking out the live chat and a
12:58 - time for coding i split it up with a
13:00 - pomodoro session so uh
13:03 - 25 minutes of coding and then five
13:04 - minutes of uh of chat
13:07 - if you try to look at the chat while
13:08 - you're coding you end up not doing
13:10 - either one very well uh and there's just
13:13 - too many interruptions
13:15 - and you can't you can't code very well
13:17 - like that
13:19 - um
13:21 - i recommend if you can
13:23 - try to show your face uh because your
13:26 - facial expressions will convey a lot of
13:27 - your meaning
13:29 - especially for your viewers who aren't
13:31 - native uh speakers to whatever language
13:34 - you're you're live coding in
13:36 - i do recommend though that that's not an
13:38 - option for most people
13:41 - so um you know that's i live coded for a
13:44 - long time without showing my face and
13:45 - that was totally fine and nobody said i
13:47 - want to see you
13:48 - okay i just decided to do it be because
13:51 - of you know being able to convey my
13:53 - meaning more try to keep in mind that
13:56 - people watching might be completely new
13:58 - and have no clue what's going on so if
13:59 - they ask a question that
14:02 - might seem like
14:05 - uh
14:08 - maybe like almost like a joke that it's
14:10 - so basic try you know don't laugh at it
14:12 - they might be new and it might be a
14:14 - legitimate question
14:15 - and if you laugh then
14:17 - you're gonna just ruin that person's
14:19 - experience of coding for that day
14:25 - and
14:26 - you set the tone for your stream so if
14:29 - you stay positive
14:31 - then
14:32 - the stream will be generally positive if
14:35 - somebody
14:36 - goes negative in the chat
14:39 - you don't even have to address it you
14:40 - can just block them or you can address
14:42 - it in a way that doesn't escalate the
14:44 - situation if you respond with negativity
14:47 - it'll cause more negativity
14:49 - if you respond to
14:51 - a criticism that's pretty harsh with you
14:54 - know thank you
14:56 - and try to figure out what the
14:59 - what you can gain from that
15:01 - then that's much more beneficial than
15:03 - you know responding with something like
15:05 - defensive right
15:07 - so
15:09 - uh
15:10 - hopefully you you do some live streaming
15:13 - and uh good luck
15:15 - the final type is software entertainment
15:19 - this type of channel has the potential
15:21 - for the most views
15:23 - creators use programming to create
15:25 - projects that are interesting to a very
15:27 - wide demographic
15:29 - the videos focus more on the outcome of
15:31 - the program and not on the actual code
15:34 - used so this type of channel like i said
15:37 - there's a it reaches a very wide
15:39 - demographic you don't actually have to
15:40 - be interested in coding to really enjoy
15:43 - watching the videos on these channels
15:46 - so once you decide your goals and the
15:48 - type of videos you want to create you're
15:50 - going to have to do some setup and
15:51 - planning here's some things you're gonna
15:53 - have to do
15:54 - so this is a screenshot from my personal
15:58 - robot family youtube channel first of
16:01 - all i want to point off off to the side
16:03 - there's a bunch of accounts under one
16:05 - username one my email address
16:07 - beaucons.gmail.com and we have a bunch
16:09 - of different accounts these are brand
16:11 - accounts so when you create your youtube
16:14 - channel it's good to create it as a
16:16 - brand account this allows you to keep
16:19 - some separation between your personal
16:20 - google account and your software youtube
16:23 - channel
16:24 - it's going to still use the same login
16:27 - as your google account so you don't have
16:28 - to keep track of another username and
16:30 - password and then you can also add
16:32 - additional people as managers of the
16:34 - account you're also going to have to
16:36 - determine your channel name so in this
16:39 - case it's robot family
16:41 - i personally recommend using your name
16:44 - as your channel name so like i would use
16:46 - the name beau carnes
16:48 - although you will see you'll see an
16:50 - example i already showed you that a lot
16:52 - of people have had success using other
16:54 - names
16:55 - but if you use your name as a channel
16:57 - name it can help better associate you
17:00 - with your content
17:02 - so you're also going to have to develop
17:03 - some things like your channel icon and
17:06 - your channel art
17:08 - and then maybe a video watermark to
17:10 - appear at the bottom of each video that
17:12 - you're playing
17:14 - so
17:15 - those things you can either design them
17:16 - yourself or you could consider maybe
17:18 - hiring someone off fiverr.com or
17:21 - something like that but you're just
17:23 - going to have to make sure you have all
17:24 - those things
17:25 - you should also determine what kind of
17:27 - intro you want
17:29 - not everyone is going to have an intro
17:30 - but you may want to intro that you have
17:32 - on all of your videos
17:34 - i wanted a piece of advice keep it under
17:36 - five seconds this should be really short
17:39 - because
17:40 - if you if your intro is too long people
17:42 - just get bored and just kind of click
17:44 - off your video before they even get into
17:46 - your video
17:47 - you also may want to consider other
17:49 - consistent things you want to add to
17:50 - your videos to set them apart like you
17:53 - may have a sign-off line or a prop
17:56 - or maybe you wrap in all of your videos
17:59 - something like that
18:00 - to make your videos stand apart
18:05 - so once you've done the high level
18:07 - planning for your channel it's time to
18:09 - start thinking about the specific videos
18:11 - you want to make
18:13 - the first step is brainstorming so just
18:15 - write down every idea you can possibly
18:18 - think of
18:20 - after that you just have to start
18:21 - narrowing down that those ideas to the
18:24 - best ideas and eventually you'll come up
18:27 - with a good list of videos that would be
18:29 - good to create so once you figure out
18:31 - what specific video you want to create
18:33 - you're going to have to do some
18:33 - researching because remember you don't
18:36 - already have to know about the topic
18:37 - beforehand but sometimes it can be good
18:39 - if you already know about the topic
18:41 - beforehand you won't have to do as much
18:42 - researching but if you don't know about
18:44 - the topic beforehand you're going to
18:45 - have to do quite a bit of researching so
18:48 - you can make the video as good as
18:50 - possible for the audience
18:52 - and you're most likely going to have to
18:54 - write a script for the video
18:56 - and if you're making a coding tutorial
18:59 - you're gonna have to write the code for
19:01 - the video beforehand
19:04 - recording and editing
19:07 - here are two of the most important
19:09 - things when it comes to recording
19:12 - first of all
19:13 - use a good microphone
19:16 - and second of all
19:17 - if you're going to show code on screen
19:20 - make it as large as possible
19:23 - if you have bad audio or tiny code
19:26 - it's gonna cause people to stop watching
19:29 - immediately before they even see the
19:31 - real content of your video
19:33 - it may be hard to believe but almost one
19:36 - third of people watching coding
19:38 - tutorials on the freecodecamp channel
19:41 - watch on a mobile phone
19:43 - you know people are watching from all
19:44 - over the world and so you want to make
19:47 - sure your content is is accessible as
19:49 - possible
19:50 - and so make sure the code is as large as
19:53 - possible
19:55 - so for audio
19:56 - almost any usb microphone will be better
19:58 - than the built-in mic on your computer
20:00 - if you can afford it consider one of
20:03 - these microphones we have the blue
20:04 - snowball the audio technica at 2005 usb
20:09 - that's what i'm recording this on right
20:10 - now
20:11 - also the blue yeti um so these are all
20:14 - good options kind of from the more entry
20:16 - level to more advanced level but if you
20:19 - can't afford a mic
20:21 - do some tests with recording audio on a
20:23 - cell phone so depending on what phone
20:24 - you have and what computer you have
20:27 - there's a chance that audio recorded on
20:29 - your cell phone could be better than
20:32 - audio on your computer so you would have
20:34 - to record the audio separately and then
20:36 - just add it in in editing later
20:39 - if you're gonna show yourself on video
20:41 - like i'm doing now the cheapest way is
20:43 - just to use a webcam or your your cell
20:47 - phone's camera a lot of cell phones
20:49 - actually have pretty good cameras but if
20:51 - you want to take things to the next
20:52 - level consider one of these cameras but
20:54 - note these cameras are probably not
20:56 - necessary if your channel mainly
20:59 - consists of coding tutorials
21:01 - but we have a few canons this panasonic
21:04 - and these are all good options
21:06 - a good camera is especially important if
21:09 - you are creating informational or
21:12 - software entertainment videos
21:14 - you also may want to include screen
21:16 - recording in your video
21:18 - if you're using a mac i recommend using
21:20 - quicktime for both screen recording and
21:22 - video recording and it should be
21:25 - pre-installed on your computer already
21:27 - if you're using windows there's a
21:29 - shortcut key to begin recording your
21:30 - screen just anytime
21:32 - you just press windows key alt
21:35 - r
21:36 - if you want to show video of your screen
21:37 - at the same time as video of you talking
21:40 - you can use obs software obs is a great
21:44 - open source software that a lot of live
21:46 - streamers use although i actually use
21:49 - final cut pro to make my face here
21:52 - appear on top of this video when you're
21:54 - recording your screen always make sure
21:56 - the main content takes up as much room
21:59 - on the screen as possible
22:01 - remember a lot of people are actually
22:03 - watching coding tutorials on mobile
22:04 - phones so all text should be as big as
22:07 - possible
22:09 - you need a very good reason to show a
22:10 - window that is not full screen
22:13 - when recording a tutorial it can be
22:15 - helpful to use two screens you can
22:18 - record one of the screens for the video
22:20 - and use the other screen for your script
22:22 - and completed code so here's something
22:24 - that some people do to make their coding
22:26 - tutorials even more polished
22:29 - first record the whole tutorial with the
22:32 - screen capture where you're talking over
22:33 - the screen capture and then transcribe
22:37 - the audio then go in and make some edits
22:39 - like uh maybe make some things more
22:41 - clear add some jokes or something and
22:44 - then re-record the audio and then put
22:46 - that audio the re-recorded audio over
22:49 - the initial video and then it's gonna
22:52 - look a lot more polished than i did
22:54 - before you should probably be editing
22:56 - your videos to make them flow smoother
22:58 - and to edit out any mistakes you can use
23:01 - editing to edit out any ums or pauses or
23:04 - loud noises and it could just make
23:06 - things seem just a lot more professional
23:09 - this is especially important if you're
23:11 - creating some software entertainment
23:14 - videos or even informational videos but
23:17 - pretty much everyone should be doing
23:19 - some editing for very simple editing you
23:21 - can use imovie on mac or movie maker on
23:25 - windows but these programs are very
23:28 - limited i personally use final cut pro
23:31 - but that is a little pricey here's a few
23:33 - other free video editors that offer more
23:36 - features than imovie or movie maker we
23:39 - have open shot video pad and light works
23:42 - after you decide what software to use
23:45 - for editing watch a few tutorials to
23:47 - learn about the basic functionality of
23:49 - the software
23:51 - another option is to hire someone to
23:52 - edit your videos
23:54 - even if you already know how to edit
23:55 - videos hiring an editor can save you a
23:57 - lot of time if you can afford it
24:00 - so you have to create thumbnails and
24:01 - titles you can have the world's best
24:04 - video but nobody will find out about it
24:06 - if they don't click on the thumbnail to
24:08 - grow your channel it is important to
24:10 - create quality content but it's almost
24:12 - equally important to use thumbnails and
24:15 - titles that will cause people to click
24:17 - on your video thumbnails are important
24:18 - for all videos but in my experience
24:20 - thumbnails are more important for
24:22 - software entertainment channels and the
24:25 - titles are actually more important for
24:27 - software tutorial channels so here's
24:30 - some tips for designing thumbnails
24:32 - some of these come from the youtube
24:34 - creator academy which has some pretty
24:36 - good tips
24:37 - so first you should brand your
24:40 - thumbnails by using consistent colors
24:42 - fonts and graphics and stuff like that
24:45 - also you should use the rule of thirds
24:48 - this will help you compose interesting
24:50 - and dynamic images so the rule of thirds
24:53 - is where you divide the image up into
24:55 - thirds and you put all the key things in
24:58 - the image on the line that would be a
25:00 - third the way into the image
25:03 - the next thing is to design for mobile
25:06 - and desktop
25:07 - thumbnails are going to show up in
25:08 - different sizes across youtube and
25:11 - sometimes people will embed your video
25:14 - so check to make sure your thumbnail
25:16 - looks good in multiple sizes that it
25:18 - could show up on
25:19 - and then finally
25:21 - get ideas from similar channels you can
25:23 - look for channels that are similar to
25:25 - what you're trying to do and see kind of
25:27 - what the general idea and styles that
25:29 - they use and that could give you some
25:31 - ideas although you do want to make sure
25:33 - that your thumbnails are distinct to
25:36 - your channel
25:38 - so next image editing software you're
25:41 - gonna need you're gonna need software to
25:43 - create your thumbnail so the top image
25:45 - editing software is photoshop
25:48 - to use it you must sign up for a monthly
25:50 - subscription service
25:51 - and so there are some cheaper
25:53 - alternatives so the most popular free
25:56 - image editing software is
25:59 - i did use for years and eventually
26:01 - i decided i needed something more user
26:04 - friendly so i purchased affinity photo
26:07 - that's this third icon here the features
26:11 - and the user experience were much better
26:13 - than so i was pretty happy to be
26:15 - able to do that it also has a one-time
26:17 - cost
26:18 - unlike photoshop that has the
26:20 - subscription model
26:21 - another good option is is pixelmator
26:23 - which is kind of similar to affinity
26:25 - photo they're both one-time costs that
26:28 - give you quite a bit of features
26:31 - choosing a title
26:33 - it's best to pick a title that people
26:35 - are searching for
26:37 - there are two main ways to find out what
26:39 - people are searching for we have youtube
26:42 - search autocomplete
26:44 - and
26:45 - google
26:45 - trends
26:47 - so let me show you how to use google
26:49 - search autocomplete to figure out what
26:51 - you should title your video
26:54 - let's say you're creating a video about
26:56 - javascript frameworks
26:58 - just go over to youtube i have the dark
27:01 - mode on so and go to the search box and
27:04 - i'm just going to type in javascript
27:07 - frameworks
27:09 - now what you can do
27:11 - is see what things are being suggested
27:14 - so right after javascript frameworks it
27:16 - says javascript frameworks
27:19 - javascript frameworks explained
27:22 - javascript frameworks tutorial
27:24 - now these are all words that people are
27:27 - commonly searching for so now because of
27:30 - this autocomplete we know what people
27:33 - are searching for what words people are
27:35 - adding with javascript frameworks when
27:37 - they search for javascript frameworks
27:40 - so in this case maybe i'll call my video
27:43 - javascript frameworks explained dash
27:46 - 2019
27:47 - okay one other tip
27:49 - i am signed in right now but generally
27:51 - you want to do this on
27:53 - incognito mode if you do it in incognito
27:56 - mode then the search recommendations
27:59 - won't be based on your search history at
28:02 - all
28:03 - another way to figure out what people
28:04 - are searching for is on google trends
28:07 - let me show you how you would use this
28:10 - say you make this four hour python
28:13 - course
28:14 - and you're thinking about what what
28:15 - should you title this should you title
28:17 - it python course is that what people are
28:20 - searching for well let's find out so i'm
28:22 - going to go to trends.google.com
28:25 - that's what i'm on now and i'm going to
28:27 - search for
28:28 - python course
28:31 - and now i can add another search term i
28:34 - can compare to other search terms so i'm
28:36 - going to compare python course to
28:39 - python tutorial
28:43 - and then where it says web search here
28:46 - i'm going to switch it to youtube search
28:49 - so now i'm seeing the relative
28:51 - popularity of different search terms on
28:54 - youtube so we can see here that
28:58 - python tutorial is way more popular than
29:02 - python course
29:04 - so maybe i was thinking about calling my
29:06 - video python course but now after i see
29:09 - this google trends i'm going to use the
29:12 - word tutorial instead of course because
29:15 - obviously the word tutorial is way more
29:17 - popular than course when people are
29:19 - searching
29:20 - and i can add as many comparisons as
29:23 - possible maybe i'm going to type in
29:25 - learn
29:26 - python are people searching for the word
29:28 - learn python well not really because
29:31 - python tutorial is still way more
29:32 - popular so this is a great way to figure
29:35 - out what people are searching for so you
29:37 - can title your videos appropriately
29:43 - so i want to briefly talk about traffic
29:45 - sources or where views come from a
29:48 - traffic source is how a viewer found
29:50 - your video to watch
29:52 - the traffic source breakdown for most
29:53 - channels on youtube looks more similar
29:56 - to this this is my robot family channel
29:58 - and this is the freecodecamp.org channel
30:00 - you can see most of the views on the
30:02 - robot family channel are coming from
30:04 - suggested videos
30:06 - and that's where when people so when
30:08 - someone's watching a video and on the
30:10 - side there'll be recommended videos on
30:12 - the side and then when people click
30:14 - those videos they're recommended on the
30:16 - side that's a suggested video now you
30:19 - can see the number two spot is browse
30:21 - features
30:22 - this includes many things but the main
30:24 - thing browse features includes is the
30:26 - home screen so when someone goes to
30:28 - youtube.com and they're signed into
30:30 - their account youtube will recommend
30:33 - specific things right on the home page
30:35 - of youtube and that's browse features so
30:38 - most channels on youtube get most of
30:41 - their views from these things suggested
30:44 - videos and browse features
30:46 - however you can see over on the free
30:48 - codecamp side we get most of our reviews
30:51 - from youtube search
30:53 - and i think this is pretty common for
30:56 - tutorial channels because if someone's
30:59 - going to watch a tutorial usually they
31:01 - know they want to watch a tutorial like
31:03 - for instance if someone's just watching
31:04 - like a funny cat video and then suddenly
31:07 - on the side it says
31:08 - watch this five hour javascript video
31:11 - people generally aren't going to want to
31:13 - go directly from the funny cat video to
31:15 - the five-hour javascript training video
31:18 - so that's why youtube search is i think
31:20 - more important for
31:22 - for tutorial channels but for a lot of
31:24 - the other channels the suggested videos
31:27 - are going to be more important
31:28 - and this is also why i think
31:31 - titles are more important for tutorial
31:34 - channels because of the search and the
31:37 - thumbnails are more important for like
31:39 - software entertainment channels and
31:42 - software informational channels
31:48 - the youtube algorithm is what decides if
31:50 - your video is going to be promoted uh in
31:52 - different places like if it's gonna be
31:53 - promoted on search or if it's gonna be
31:55 - recommended and the youtube algorithm is
31:57 - a mysterious thing
31:59 - it's my belief that even youtube
32:01 - engineers don't completely understand
32:03 - how it works uh basically it's it's all
32:06 - based on machine learning and artificial
32:08 - intelligence the
32:10 - the people that program the algorithm
32:12 - they just tell it the outcomes they want
32:15 - and then the algorithm determines how to
32:17 - best achieve those outcomes
32:20 - so
32:21 - i'm about to show you i'm about to tell
32:24 - you the things i've figured out about
32:25 - how to how to get your video popular
32:28 - but
32:30 - there could be exceptions to everything
32:31 - i'm about to tell you
32:32 - this is just based on a lot of
32:34 - experience and a lot of research and
32:36 - things i've heard that other popular
32:38 - youtubers have said okay let's start
32:39 - with talking about what the algorithm
32:42 - doesn't care about
32:44 - asterisk
32:46 - that just means that all these things
32:48 - the algorithm does care about a little
32:50 - tiny bit but just not that much compared
32:54 - to what the algorithm does care about
32:57 - which i'll be talking about next so the
33:00 - first thing is upload frequency
33:02 - i've heard people say that creators must
33:05 - upload a video every few days with no
33:07 - breaks to really grow a channel
33:09 - this seems like a myth to me
33:11 - i've seen many channels with infrequent
33:13 - uploads that get a ton of views on each
33:15 - video
33:16 - and i believe the youtube algorithm does
33:18 - not care that much about upload
33:20 - frequency
33:22 - sometimes youtube engineers will
33:23 - actually run studies to better
33:25 - understand how the algorithm works
33:27 - and on an official youtube channel aimed
33:29 - at creators they discussed a study that
33:32 - showed that taking a break from creating
33:35 - videos
33:36 - does not impact the view count when a
33:39 - creator comes back from a break
33:41 - so while upload frequency is not always
33:44 - correlated with how many views you get
33:47 - it could impact whether a viewer will
33:49 - subscribe to your channel
33:51 - if you haven't uploaded for a while a
33:53 - user will be less likely to subscribe
33:56 - next is video tags
33:59 - youtube representatives have officially
34:01 - said that youtube tags count as almost
34:04 - nothing when it comes to recommendations
34:08 - everything has some amount of impact but
34:10 - this is one of the lowest impact items
34:13 - so you don't have to
34:14 - spend too much time on the video tags
34:17 - although
34:19 - you might as well
34:20 - still put them in there because it has a
34:22 - very tiny
34:23 - impact
34:24 - the algorithm looks for patterns so once
34:27 - it determines that videos from your
34:28 - channel are often watched by a certain
34:31 - type of user it will just keep
34:33 - recommending your videos to that type of
34:35 - viewer
34:36 - no matter what the tags in the descript
34:38 - and the description say so it's possible
34:41 - that before the algorithm identifies a
34:44 - pattern for your channel it will use
34:46 - tags as an identifier
34:49 - next how well a previous video performed
34:53 - in my experience the performance of the
34:55 - previous video has very little impact on
34:58 - a subsequent videos performance
35:01 - this is true both on my channel and then
35:04 - other channels i've observed
35:06 - however i think it could impact how
35:08 - quickly a video gets popular so if a
35:12 - user just watched a video from your
35:14 - channel the algorithm may be more likely
35:17 - to recommend a new video from your
35:19 - channel right after was posted
35:21 - but if not many users are going to click
35:24 - to watch it and they don't watch their
35:26 - very long the algorithm will quickly
35:28 - stop recommending that new video
35:31 - on the other hand if not many people
35:33 - watch your previous video your video may
35:35 - not get recommended a lot at first but
35:38 - if lots of people are clicking on it and
35:40 - they are watching it for a very long
35:42 - time youtube will start recommending it
35:44 - a lot
35:46 - i've seen countless examples of
35:47 - extremely popular videos coming right
35:50 - after an unpopular video
35:52 - descriptions these do matter to the
35:55 - algorithm a little bit
35:57 - just very little compared to
35:58 - click-through rate and average view
36:01 - duration which is what i'm going to talk
36:02 - about later of what the algorithm
36:04 - algorithm does care about
36:06 - according to youtube the first few lines
36:09 - of a description can be important
36:11 - especially for searches
36:13 - so you should fill the first sentence
36:15 - with as many relevant search terms as
36:18 - possible
36:19 - when search terms are lower down in the
36:21 - description they count less to the
36:23 - algorithm
36:24 - a rookie mistake is to put links or ads
36:27 - as the first line in the description
36:30 - while some big name youtube channels do
36:31 - this that's because the algorithm has
36:34 - already figured out patterns for where
36:36 - to recommend their videos
36:38 - for smaller channels you should always
36:40 - put a keyword rich descriptive sentence
36:43 - as the first line but remember even the
36:46 - best description can't make up for low
36:48 - click-through rates and low average view
36:50 - durations
36:52 - next thing is subscriber count
36:55 - the algorithm is more likely to
36:56 - recommend your video to subscribers so
36:59 - this does have some impact
37:01 - but i often see very popular videos on
37:05 - channels with low subscribers accounts
37:07 - and very unpopular videos on channels
37:09 - with high subscribers
37:11 - if people don't watch your videos for a
37:12 - long time it doesn't matter how many
37:14 - subscribers you have because the
37:15 - algorithm is just going to quickly stop
37:17 - recommending your video to subscribers
37:19 - also subscribers have to click the bell
37:22 - icon in order to be notified of every
37:24 - video if they don't click the bell icon
37:27 - then they may not really be notified of
37:29 - any video on your channel however there
37:31 - are benefits to having more subscribers
37:33 - when users search your videos will
37:35 - appear higher in the search results if
37:37 - they're subscribed to your channel
37:39 - also the algorithm is heavily impacted
37:41 - by patterns
37:42 - if user clicks on every video from your
37:44 - channel that appears in the feed
37:47 - then the algorithm will keep putting
37:48 - more videos from you in their feed
37:51 - average percentage of video viewed
37:55 - this one can have an impact for shorter
37:57 - videos if your video is just one minute
37:59 - long it makes a difference what
38:01 - percentage of the video is viewed but if
38:04 - you're posting hour-long tutorials the
38:06 - percentage viewed is much less important
38:09 - on the freecodecamp.org channel we have
38:11 - a four and a half hour long python video
38:13 - with over seven million views
38:15 - its average view percentage is 4.3
38:18 - percent but its average view duration is
38:21 - 11 minutes 20 seconds
38:23 - average view duration matters way more
38:26 - than average percentage viewed
38:29 - okay this is the important stuff what
38:31 - the algorithm does care about it cares
38:34 - about click-through rate and average
38:37 - view duration
38:38 - basically just those two things if your
38:41 - videos have a high click-through rate
38:43 - and high average view duration nothing
38:46 - else matters your video will be popular
38:49 - click through rate measures how often
38:51 - viewers watch the video after seeing the
38:54 - thumbnail on youtube you need to have a
38:56 - thumbnail title that people will want to
38:58 - click on
38:59 - average view duration is how long people
39:01 - are watching your video on average
39:04 - your video needs to hold viewers
39:06 - interest for as long as possible
39:08 - i heard a popular youtuber say that your
39:10 - video is almost always going to be
39:12 - popular if you have at least seven
39:14 - minutes you have an average watch time
39:16 - of at least seven minutes now that's
39:18 - pretty hard to achieve so it's like a
39:21 - lot of people aren't going to get to
39:22 - that seven minute mark but the closer
39:23 - you can get the better hey there my name
39:25 - is rtc or candy or real tough candy and
39:28 - i am the founder of the real tough candy
39:30 - youtube channel this channel is a
39:33 - software focused educational channel the
39:36 - little bit of entertainment thrown in
39:38 - with a very big emphasis on web
39:41 - development because everything's going
39:43 - to the web
39:44 - there's just so much going on in that
39:46 - sphere that
39:47 - you could talk about it for a very long
39:50 - time my goal with the channel is to
39:52 - simply make people better developers
39:54 - whether they're aspiring developers
39:56 - they've been in the business for a few
39:57 - years or their
39:59 - tried and true battle hardened senior
40:01 - devs who have seen it all my goal is to
40:03 - be part of their journey and make them
40:05 - better devs i have videos spanning from
40:08 - awesome github repos to my experiences
40:11 - with freelancing to getting started with
40:13 - freelancing i'm also the author of a few
40:15 - books and video courses i've been
40:16 - producing videos as real tough candy for
40:18 - about two and a half years if you're
40:21 - thinking about starting a software
40:23 - channel on youtube
40:25 - number one i would say go for it but i
40:27 - think my most important advice and the
40:29 - thing i'd
40:30 - emphasize the most
40:32 - is to do videos that you care about do
40:34 - topics that you care about
40:36 - otherwise it just becomes another
40:39 - drudgery filled task
40:41 - just oh time to do another video oh this
40:44 - person's uploading five days a week i
40:46 - bes i guess i better catch up you're
40:48 - gonna burn out and i've done that i've
40:49 - made that mistake of trying to keep up
40:51 - with the algorithm or trying to keep up
40:53 - with other people in this niche you just
40:55 - have to do it your way
40:57 - and i've been going on camera more and
40:59 - more i really don't like being on camera
41:02 - but people like that they want to see
41:04 - you even if you are imperfect
41:07 - which most of us are
41:09 - um and i know it can be very daunting
41:11 - i'm always going to have a little bit of
41:13 - an aversion to being on camera
41:16 - but it's what people like to see and
41:18 - they like to see that you're human i
41:20 - don't think you need to have a passion
41:21 - for it but you should have an interest
41:23 - in it that's really going to show in the
41:25 - videos that you make i would love to see
41:28 - more creators on this platform doing
41:30 - software web development stuff whether
41:32 - it's tutorials insights just personal
41:35 - journeys those are really powerful to
41:37 - our personal journeys especially for
41:39 - self-taught so important and i think
41:42 - important
41:43 - for the record i hope to see your
41:45 - channel soon and i'll see in the next
41:46 - video
41:50 - well you don't have to be uploading all
41:51 - the time it is good to have a consistent
41:54 - schedule i this helps people know that
41:57 - there you're probably going to upload
41:59 - again pretty soon so it's worth
42:00 - subscribing to the channel
42:03 - now if you aren't going to
42:05 - publish very frequently i would say it's
42:08 - probably better to have more substantial
42:10 - content like if you're going to create a
42:12 - three to four hour like python tutorial
42:15 - it's probably okay to
42:18 - upload maybe every month or two
42:20 - but if you're gonna
42:22 - upload shorter content like shorter
42:23 - informational content you may want to
42:26 - upload more frequently like once a week
42:28 - or twice a week or maybe like two times
42:30 - a month or something like that so
42:32 - consistency also kind of uh helps you to
42:36 - to
42:37 - to
42:38 - kind of motivate get motivated i know if
42:40 - you have a consistent schedule you try
42:41 - to stick to it all the time it will help
42:43 - you mo be motivated to continue with
42:45 - that schedule to help with consistency
42:47 - you should create goals for yourself
42:50 - an effective goal
42:52 - is measurable
42:53 - timed and controllable
42:56 - measurable means that the goal should
42:58 - have a quantified component that lets
42:59 - you know whether you've reached or not
43:01 - timed just the goal should have a
43:03 - specific and realistic deadline
43:05 - controllable means that you should it
43:07 - should be an action you can perform
43:09 - rather than an outcome you want for
43:12 - example your goal may be to put out one
43:14 - video measurable per week timed
43:18 - note that put out a video is an action
43:20 - you can perform but reach 1000
43:23 - subscribers is not an action but an
43:25 - outcome
43:27 - you should create goals that are
43:28 - ambitious but still doable this will
43:31 - depend quite a bit on your stage of life
43:33 - if you're a single person with no job
43:35 - you'll be able to create much more
43:36 - content than a married person with three
43:39 - kids and a full-time job
43:44 - when thinking about making money you
43:46 - must know what your goals are now some
43:48 - people just want to provide free free
43:50 - learning resources and they're not
43:51 - really concerned about making money but
43:53 - most people aren't able to invest time
43:55 - into creating resources unless they're
43:58 - compensated a bit here are a few common
44:00 - ways that your software channel can make
44:03 - you money
44:04 - we'll go over all of these one at a time
44:08 - for most people the primary way a
44:10 - software youtube channel will help you
44:11 - make money is through helping you get a
44:14 - new job or a raise i already mentioned
44:16 - that starting a youtube channel was
44:18 - really helpful for me when i went to get
44:20 - my first software developer job
44:22 - and i've heard similar stories from a
44:24 - lot of different creators
44:26 - so let's hear firsthand from jesse
44:28 - weigle about how live streaming helped
44:31 - him in his career
44:33 - live coding was so helpful whenever i
44:36 - was looking for a job and going on
44:38 - interviews
44:40 - which was was unexpected to me
44:44 - but
44:45 - seeing that i did the live coding
44:48 - like on my resume and being able to
44:50 - watch my my shows
44:52 - uh i think
44:55 - got me more interviews than anything
44:57 - else that that i did
44:59 - so and employers
45:01 - already knew what they were getting
45:04 - when
45:05 - when they called me in for the interview
45:07 - normally it's like uh
45:11 - you know it's kind of a mystery what the
45:13 - person's really going to be like you
45:14 - can't tell that much you know from a
45:17 - resume or a portfolio
45:20 - but
45:22 - being able to see my thought process
45:24 - while i'm coding
45:26 - made me a more attractive candidate
45:29 - because it it took some of that that
45:31 - question out of it
45:32 - i was like what are we getting into uh
45:35 - such a big commitment when you hire
45:36 - somebody so
45:38 - being able to show
45:40 - you know my skills and my personality my
45:44 - thought process
45:46 - you know online
45:48 - through live coding
45:49 - uh was just
45:51 - it was a big bonus
45:52 - and to potential employers
45:55 - also when i went on the interviews
45:58 - that i got asked about my live coding
46:01 - experience more than anything else
46:04 - everybody wanted to know about it
46:07 - i guess
46:08 - it's something that
46:10 - it seems like a lot of other developers
46:12 - are curious about or they wonder like
46:15 - how how could you do that
46:17 - just the idea of
46:20 - being able to make mistakes in front of
46:22 - all those people or being able to talk
46:24 - you know so much while you're coding
46:27 - and that's another aspect that that was
46:29 - very helpful
46:30 - when i actually did get an interview and
46:33 - i had to do a coding exercise
46:36 - one of the big things that
46:38 - people are looking for
46:40 - is that
46:41 - you know they they don't
46:43 - they don't want to know if you can just
46:44 - do the coding exercise
46:47 - they want to know your thought process
46:49 - your problem solving skills so
46:51 - i already had so much practice at
46:53 - explaining what i was doing while i was
46:55 - doing it
46:58 - through live coding so that was that was
46:59 - perfect
47:01 - so when i went in there it was just
47:03 - it was totally normal
47:05 - for me to just say what i was thinking
47:08 - you know as i was doing it
47:10 - so
47:12 - in a very unexpected way live coding
47:15 - definitely helped help me get interviews
47:18 - and help me prepare for interviews
47:21 - the next way you can make money is
47:23 - through youtube ad revenue
47:25 - but you probably won't make that much
47:28 - money this way
47:29 - most channels earn between one dollar
47:32 - and two dollars fifty cents us dollars
47:35 - per 1000 views
47:37 - but it is possible to earn less or more
47:39 - than that
47:40 - so if you want to make thirty thousand
47:42 - dollars in a year you may have to get
47:44 - thirty million views
47:47 - the freecodecamp.org channel is ad free
47:50 - however my personal robot family channel
47:53 - shows ads and i generally get about one
47:56 - dollar to one dollar fifty cents per
47:58 - 1000 views for videos under 10 minutes
48:02 - and two dollars to 2.50 per 1000 views
48:05 - for videos over 10 minutes
48:08 - at 10 minutes you are allowed to add
48:10 - mid-roll ads
48:12 - and i was very surprised with how much
48:14 - extra money that made me
48:17 - you only make money on video ads if
48:19 - people click on them or watch at least
48:22 - 30 seconds of the ad
48:24 - if they click on skip ad you make no
48:27 - money also the amount of money you make
48:30 - per ad is dependent on the country that
48:33 - the viewer is in
48:35 - some viewers will make you more money
48:37 - than other viewers
48:39 - this is one of the reasons there is such
48:41 - a big difference in how much money you
48:42 - can make one of the more effective ways
48:44 - to make money on youtube is to use your
48:47 - youtube channel to help promote your
48:49 - paid courses
48:51 - mosh from the programmingwithmosh
48:53 - youtube channel seems to do pretty well
48:56 - with this model for this to work best
48:58 - you need to create multiple high quality
49:01 - complete courses
49:03 - release some full courses for free on
49:06 - youtube and use those courses to
49:08 - advertise your paid courses
49:11 - some people go about this in the wrong
49:13 - way they'll create this full paid course
49:15 - and just release just like a portion of
49:18 - it on youtube and hopefully that portion
49:20 - will encourage people to buy the paid
49:22 - course that's the wrong way to do it
49:25 - what you want to do is create two
49:27 - full-length courses release one
49:30 - full-length course on youtube for free
49:33 - and use that to help promote your other
49:35 - full-length course if you just release a
49:38 - small portion of your course on youtube
49:40 - it's not going to generate as many views
49:43 - so not as many people are going to watch
49:45 - it they're not going to want to watch us
49:46 - a personal course so then you won't get
49:48 - very much promotion for your your paid
49:50 - course but if you release a full course
49:53 - on youtube then you're really going to
49:55 - get a lot of people watching that and a
49:57 - lot of views for your full paid course
50:00 - many people who create software
50:01 - tutorials have had success with patreon
50:04 - let's hear some tips from kevin markham
50:06 - who has had a lot of success with
50:08 - patreon
50:09 - hi there my name is kevin markham and i
50:11 - teach data science in python through my
50:13 - youtube channel which is called data
50:15 - school i've been using patreon to
50:18 - support my page for about a year and so
50:20 - i'd like to share two things with you
50:22 - number one who should start a patreon
50:25 - page and number two
50:27 - seven quick tips for being successful on
50:30 - patreon
50:31 - so who should start a patreon page well
50:36 - i would recommend that if you are
50:37 - interested in building a community and
50:40 - then delivering value to that community
50:42 - then you are a good fit for using
50:45 - patreon if your only motivation is to
50:48 - make money then i don't recommend
50:49 - patreon
50:51 - quite frankly unless you are
50:53 - legitimately famous
50:55 - putting a link to patreon from your
50:58 - youtube channel page is not going to
51:00 - suddenly bring in a lot of money
51:02 - instead doing well on patreon requires a
51:05 - lot of work
51:06 - and so unless you're really interested
51:08 - in doing that work and enjoy that work
51:12 - it's not a good use of your time and
51:14 - you're going to burn out and that's not
51:15 - good for you or for your fans
51:19 - okay let's move on to my seven quick
51:21 - tips for being successful on patreon
51:24 - tip number one deliver a lot of value to
51:27 - your audience for free before starting a
51:31 - patreon page
51:32 - the reason is this very few people are
51:35 - going to support you financially unless
51:37 - you've already demonstrated to them that
51:40 - you can create great videos that they
51:42 - love
51:43 - tip number two try to build a following
51:46 - outside of youtube so that you have more
51:48 - ways to communicate with your audience
51:51 - social media is one option for this but
51:54 - even better is starting an email list
51:56 - and getting them to subscribe
51:59 - tip number three study successful
52:01 - patreon pages and check out their
52:03 - rewards and how they describe the value
52:06 - they're offering that will help you to
52:09 - refine your rewards and how you
52:11 - communicate your value proposition
52:14 - tip number four before you launch
52:17 - draft your patreon page and share it
52:19 - with some of your top fans to get their
52:21 - feedback that'll help you to determine
52:24 - whether you're offering the right
52:25 - rewards and at the right prices
52:29 - tip number five when you launch talk
52:32 - with your fans authentically about
52:34 - patreon and why they should join
52:36 - give them some time to join and you can
52:38 - remind them every now and again but
52:41 - don't try to make them feel guilty for
52:43 - not becoming a
52:44 - patron tip number six once people join
52:48 - build that community that we've been
52:50 - talking about um create meaningful ways
52:53 - for you to interact with your patrons
52:55 - and ideally give them ways to interact
52:58 - with each other tip number seven deliver
53:01 - value to your patrons
53:04 - offer them bonus content and cool
53:05 - rewards do special things for them when
53:08 - you can
53:10 - thank them frequently and above all else
53:13 - prioritize them over the rest of your
53:15 - fans because they're supporting you
53:17 - financially
53:19 - and keep doing this every single month
53:21 - because patreon is a marathon not a
53:24 - sprint
53:25 - okay i hope these tips have been helpful
53:27 - to you
53:28 - good luck with your channel and with
53:30 - your patreon page
53:32 - many creators make money through video
53:34 - sponsorships caleb curry has some great
53:36 - tips for making money through
53:37 - sponsorships hey everyone it's caleb
53:40 - thank you beau for having me i'm gonna
53:42 - be sharing with you guys how you can get
53:43 - sponsors for your content i'm actually
53:45 - really excited that you reached out to
53:47 - me for this because i've tried various
53:48 - ways of monetizing my content i've tried
53:51 - courses i've tried monthly subscriptions
53:53 - and for me nothing has really clicked
53:55 - other creators have done a great job and
53:57 - that's awesome they should keep doing
53:58 - that but i found that my true skill is
54:01 - with the sponsorships it's how i've made
54:03 - the majority of my income and it's how
54:05 - i'm able to do youtube as a full-time
54:07 - project now how do you actually get that
54:10 - first sponsor
54:11 - the number one way i have found that i
54:14 - was able to get sponsors and i'm still
54:15 - getting sponsors today is with a contact
54:18 - form on my website consider it a landing
54:21 - page a lead page whatever you want to
54:23 - call it essentially a way a company can
54:25 - fill out the form say what they're
54:28 - interested in put their email and click
54:30 - submit
54:31 - when you have something like this on
54:33 - your website you are able to control
54:35 - the the flow of customers so they're not
54:38 - being distracted by other things to
54:41 - click on yeah they might go to other
54:42 - parts of your site but if you put your
54:44 - stuff up on social media or other
54:47 - websites you are competing against
54:49 - thousands of other people but on your
54:52 - own site you are the the sole owner of
54:54 - that website and you can control the
54:56 - experience on that website which means
54:59 - you're gonna get much higher quality
55:00 - leads and the conversion is gonna be
55:03 - much higher if you get someone to check
55:05 - out that sponsorship page
55:07 - they're very highly likely to fill out
55:10 - that form at the bottom the second thing
55:12 - is that you can share this form with
55:13 - your audience or link to it on the home
55:16 - page of your website you don't want it
55:18 - to be the only thing people see like
55:21 - my goodness this guy will not stop
55:22 - advertising his sponsorship
55:24 - opportunities but you also don't want it
55:26 - to be hidden where a company would have
55:28 - to search for it you want companies to
55:30 - be able to easily reach out to you in a
55:32 - professional way and three go through
55:35 - the added effort to refine your niche
55:38 - and make your value proposition
55:40 - extremely clear you should have a
55:42 - general niche maybe it's programming or
55:44 - maybe it's web development or app
55:46 - development whatever it is you start
55:48 - with that in stage three of my little
55:50 - plan i have here you refine that and get
55:53 - very clear about what a sponsor is going
55:56 - to get from sponsoring your series step
55:59 - four is to try to quantify the value
56:02 - that you're offering them
56:04 - you don't want to scare them off with
56:05 - numbers like if you're just trying to
56:06 - get a sponsor you don't need to give
56:08 - them the roi and the conversion rate of
56:12 - clicks and all just don't overwhelm them
56:13 - with information unless they
56:15 - specifically ask but for your sake and
56:17 - also for the sake of getting new
56:19 - sponsors you should probably have some
56:21 - way to measure the performance of of
56:23 - your advertisements the performance of
56:25 - your videos and what you can do is you
56:26 - can build tracking links in your
56:28 - description and you can see what the
56:30 - click-through rate is you know maybe a
56:31 - video gets 10 000 views 100 people click
56:34 - it and two people sign up you've
56:37 - essentially taken a view count and
56:39 - figured out how many sign-ups that
56:41 - translates to now it is vague and
56:43 - different companies have different goals
56:45 - some are going to want sign ups and some
56:46 - are just going to want brand awareness
56:48 - so you got to be open and flexible but
56:50 - you should ultimately have some
56:52 - perspective on how well your channel
56:55 - does and how well a sponsor is going to
56:57 - perform on your channel so for all of my
57:00 - sponsors they go through a trackable
57:02 - link that i can see how many clicks
57:04 - they've gotten step five is start to
57:06 - grow your sponsorship base
57:08 - obviously anytime you can get a
57:09 - repeating sponsor that is great but
57:11 - being open to different sponsors without
57:13 - just taking anything is going to be good
57:16 - for your brand as well because that
57:17 - gives a larger variety to your content
57:20 - and allows you to be creative in the
57:22 - types of advertisements which by the way
57:24 - try to make your ads creative i do skits
57:27 - i'm excited in my ad spots you don't
57:29 - want to be one person in your videos and
57:31 - a totally different person in your ad
57:32 - spots they should be the same thing so
57:35 - step five is to grow that sponsorship
57:38 - base and just get more experience doing
57:40 - it and start increasing your prices to
57:42 - where you can actually make a
57:43 - substantial amount of money and now
57:45 - we'll move on to step six and for me i'm
57:48 - somewhere between five and six so
57:50 - this is exactly where i'm at right now
57:53 - step six is to try to productize or
57:56 - standardize your sponsorships so far
57:58 - i've just kind of been working with
58:00 - whatever the company's going for you
58:02 - know i'm trying to meet their needs in
58:03 - an exact way but now i'm to the point
58:05 - where i'm getting lots of sponsorship
58:07 - requests and i can start saying no on
58:09 - the regular i can also increase prices a
58:11 - lot because of the demand so as an
58:14 - example you could say hey you can get 20
58:17 - to 30 second ads embedded in my videos
58:20 - you can get eight of them for
58:22 - this many dollars once you productize
58:24 - your stuff it makes it easier to
58:26 - automate the process and make your life
58:28 - a whole lot easier so i'm refining my
58:31 - contact me form to have those options
58:33 - the company can say exactly what they
58:35 - want and it takes the mental stress off
58:37 - of me to have to come up with a brand
58:39 - new idea every time a company reaches
58:41 - out to me so those are just the basics
58:43 - if you want more details i'm releasing
58:45 - more entrepreneurship content on my
58:47 - channel as well as app development and
58:48 - where those two come together i'd love
58:51 - to have you guys i'm not going to
58:52 - advertise but go check out my channel
58:55 - i'm just playing thank you and let me
58:57 - know what you guys think what tips would
58:58 - you have for sponsorships
59:02 - promoting can be challenging if you're
59:03 - just starting out you must think about
59:05 - where your target audience could come
59:07 - across your videos
59:09 - here are some ideas you can post to
59:11 - relevant subreddits
59:13 - or you may want to submit to a coding
59:15 - newsletter like the code newbie
59:17 - newsletter
59:18 - or maybe you want you can share on
59:20 - programming forums
59:22 - such as thefreecodecamp.org forum now
59:25 - note about forums it's more appropriate
59:27 - to share on forums that you're already
59:29 - active on
59:31 - for instance if you're already active on
59:32 - the freecodecamp.org forum that'll be a
59:34 - great place to share your videos but
59:36 - there if there are other forums that
59:38 - you're already active on that could be a
59:40 - better place to share your videos
59:42 - another option is to get your video
59:45 - published on a more popular channel for
59:47 - instance the free code cam channel we
59:49 - publish tutorials from a lot of
59:51 - different contributors and if your goal
59:53 - is just to get your video in front of as
59:54 - many people as possible the free code
59:57 - camp channel could be a good option so
59:59 - if you want to submit a video to me
60:02 - here's my email address beau free
60:04 - codecamp.org we may be able to publish
60:06 - your video on our channel
60:08 - also maybe you'll find a different
60:10 - channel that you can submit your videos
60:11 - to if you want to kind of take advantage
60:13 - of an
60:14 - audience that already exists
60:16 - okay let's just end with some
60:18 - miscellaneous tips
60:19 - first of all consider adding in screens
60:22 - to your videos
60:23 - they can lead to many more views
60:25 - especially if you create shorter videos
60:28 - on my personal robot family channel i
60:31 - get six percent of views from end
60:32 - screens
60:34 - if a video is part of a playlist always
60:36 - link to the playlist in the description
60:39 - there's nothing worse than coming across
60:41 - a really great video that's part of a
60:42 - series but then you can't figure out how
60:44 - to get to the other videos in that
60:46 - series so playlist in the description
60:49 - if you have already created a full
60:51 - course with lots of individual videos
60:54 - consider combining them into one long
60:56 - video
60:57 - if you really want to post the videos
60:59 - individually
61:00 - never upload them all at once make sure
61:03 - to space out each video by at least a
61:05 - few hours
61:06 - one per day would be best because if you
61:08 - upload them all at once they may appear
61:10 - in the wrong order on your channel and
61:13 - it's better for them to appear in the
61:15 - correct order it makes it easier for
61:17 - people to find the right video in the
61:19 - series
61:20 - next always expect that each video will
61:22 - be the first video from your channel
61:24 - that many people will see
61:26 - if you want to grow your channel try to
61:28 - maximize the number of new people who
61:30 - are stumbling upon it
61:32 - some creators make the mistake of just
61:34 - making videos for their subscribers
61:36 - this results in videos that may be
61:38 - confusing for someone new to the channel
61:40 - you should always include a quick update
61:42 - about where people can get prior
61:44 - knowledge expected especially if viewers
61:46 - need prior knowledge from other videos
61:48 - on your channel next never include
61:51 - background music in a coding tutorial
61:54 - it's often distracting if people want to
61:56 - listen to music while watching a
61:57 - tutorial they can turn on their own
61:59 - music obviously this doesn't apply for a
62:01 - software entertainment video
62:03 - and other types of videos but a coding
62:05 - tutorial never use background music you
62:07 - may want to use it in an intro or an
62:09 - outro but not during the main part of
62:11 - the video
62:13 - next if you are including a series name
62:15 - in the title it should be at the end of
62:18 - the title
62:19 - for instance if you have a video that's
62:21 - called
62:22 - javascript tutorial dash lists
62:27 - like maybe you're creating this
62:28 - javascript series and you're on a video
62:31 - that's just about lists put the word
62:34 - lists at the beginning of the title and
62:36 - the word javascript tutorial at the end
62:39 - of the title
62:41 - okay
62:42 - now you pretty much know everything you
62:44 - need to know to get started with your
62:46 - own software youtube channel
62:48 - and if you have any other tips or
62:50 - questions just leave them in the
