15:21 - to select and
15:23 - i am
15:24 - very confident that i made the right
15:25 - decisions looking around the room like
15:27 - pretty this is pretty much a who's who
15:29 - of people who have made the pre-code
15:31 - camp community what it is today
15:34 - and what is the free code camp community
15:39 - all right thank you tony uh so
15:42 - free code camp
15:43 - is a global community of developers who
15:46 - are helping people in their communities
15:47 - learn to code
15:48 - we have a ton of free open source
15:52 - learning materials a ton of creative
15:54 - commons learning material we have a ton
15:57 - of videos on youtube we have a ton of
15:58 - articles on medium we have a ton of
16:00 - podcast episodes
16:03 - and we have an incredible
16:06 - curriculum
16:07 - that the entire community has come
16:09 - together
16:10 - and sculpted over the past three and a
16:12 - half years
16:14 - and everything is completely free and
16:16 - open source free code camp itself is now
16:19 - a 501c3 nonprofit which means that we're
16:22 - tax exempt and any donations to free
16:25 - code camp are tax deductible if you
16:27 - happen to have like an employee matching
16:29 - thing in your office or something keep
16:31 - that in mind uh or if you just happen to
16:34 - have like a killer a year and you don't
16:35 - want your tax liabilities to be too big
16:38 - so
16:40 - but um
16:42 - we're doing a lot of exciting things
16:44 - with the donations from our community
16:46 - we're powering servers that right now if
16:49 - i were to look uh there'd probably be
16:51 - four or five hundred people using the
16:52 - core learning platform even saturday
16:54 - night uh we have millions of people
16:58 - using free code camp every month
17:00 - all around the world we have a ton of
17:02 - people in india we have a ton of people
17:04 - in nigeria bangladesh china has more
17:07 - than 100 000 active campers
17:10 - and then here in the u.s of course
17:13 - europe latin america central america
17:17 - all over the world
17:18 - africa
17:20 - even australia where i was last month
17:22 - and australians are the most
17:25 - chill people
17:27 - i have to say
17:29 - so we have a lot of people from all
17:31 - around the world here tonight and i'm
17:34 - going to try to talk to every single one
17:36 - of you
17:37 - uh live on stream if you're cool with it
17:40 - and just talk a little bit about how you
17:42 - got involved in free code camp what
17:44 - you're interested in doing
17:46 - in the coming year
17:48 - what your own personal goals are for
17:49 - your career
17:51 - and of course
17:54 - why you became part of this community
17:56 - what what encouraged you to take your
17:59 - scarce
18:00 - free time
18:01 - and turn around and invest it into an
18:04 - open source project
18:06 - aimed at helping increase technology
18:08 - literacy
18:09 - so
18:10 - i'm very excited to talk with all of you
18:13 - just to give you a quick recap on how
18:15 - free code camp is doing
18:17 - we have
18:19 - recently launched the new curriculum
18:20 - about two months ago and it's been very
18:23 - popular so far
18:26 - there are a lot of ways we can continue
18:28 - to improve it it's never going to be
18:29 - finished it's always going to be a work
18:31 - in progress
18:32 - we have
18:34 - tons of study groups around the world
18:36 - many of whom the leadership of which is
18:39 - here today and we're going to talk about
18:42 - the future of those study groups and
18:43 - ways that we can further expand them and
18:45 - make it easier for people to start study
18:47 - groups and participate in study groups
18:49 - and make it easier for people to find
18:51 - study groups and we're we're thinking
18:53 - about ways we can take the hundreds of
18:55 - people that are using free cocoa in any
18:57 - given moment and raise awareness if
18:59 - there's a study group in their city
19:00 - right there on freecodecamp.org
19:03 - just in time like hey a study group is
19:05 - starting in six hours would you like to
19:07 - rsvp
19:09 - and also take the study groups and make
19:11 - them more granular so you don't have to
19:13 - go
19:14 - uh you don't have to commute 30 minutes
19:16 - to get to a study group after work
19:18 - there's a neighborhood study group and
19:19 - then there's like a city level study
19:21 - group that meets once a week or once a
19:23 - month
19:24 - so we'll have a much more granular
19:26 - spread out distributed community where
19:29 - people are learning to code in smaller
19:31 - groups and coming together for bigger
19:33 - events we're working on hackathon tools
19:37 - to make it easier for us to have big
19:38 - online hackathons where everybody can
19:41 - join in and participate wherever they
19:43 - are in the world
19:45 - our values
19:47 - are
19:48 - of course being completely free being
19:50 - convenient for busy people who have kids
19:53 - who have full-time jobs who are going to
19:54 - school full-time
19:55 - who have elderly parents they're taking
19:57 - care of
19:58 - all kinds of people who are all kinds of
20:00 - busy
20:01 - and we want to be a resource that
20:04 - acknowledges
20:05 - it's 2018
20:06 - people are busier than ever there's no
20:08 - sign of people being less busy in the
20:10 - near future we want to make it so it's
20:12 - convenient
20:14 - for all of you
20:15 - to
20:16 - sit down
20:17 - and get in 30 minutes of coding today an
20:20 - hour of coding a day maybe just do a
20:22 - long weekend where you build up an app
20:24 - over the course of several hours
20:27 - we want to be
20:28 - here for you all so you can continue to
20:31 - expand your skills throughout your your
20:32 - career as you progress
20:35 - and as you transition
20:37 - from field to field and as you get more
20:39 - and more technical over time
20:41 - so
20:42 - thank you again everyone for joining me
20:46 - i think at this point if it's cool
20:48 - i'd like to pass the microphone around
20:50 - and have everyone briefly introduce
20:52 - themselves to everybody else
20:54 - and i think the way we can do this is
20:57 - your name
20:59 - where you're from
21:02 - what your near-term goals are
21:06 - if you have
21:07 - a goal like you want to
21:09 - take your study group and have it be
21:12 - from instead of once a month have it be
21:14 - once a week
21:15 - if your goal is to
21:17 - open more pull requests against the free
21:19 - code camp guide or if you want to
21:21 - contribute to firefox or some other
21:23 - major open source projects if you want
21:24 - to get more freelance clients whatever
21:27 - your goal is i think this would be a
21:28 - great opportunity for you to
21:31 - share it with the world
21:32 - and kind of commit
21:34 - if you will
21:35 - no pressure
21:37 - and if you don't have a goal if your
21:38 - goal is just to continue doing more of
21:39 - this what you're doing fantastic you can
21:42 - just say so uh and if you don't want to
21:44 - be on stream just let me know just kind
21:46 - of like
21:47 - and walk over toward a corner where you
21:49 - won't be on stream
21:52 - all right so i think we can just start
21:54 - over here
21:55 - with billy lee
21:59 - um
22:00 - i'm billy i'm from sacramento california
22:02 - and my near-term goal is just to improve
22:05 - on my skill set um just doing some more

22:10 - so that's about it
22:13 - hey everybody i'm nicole r chambeau i'm
22:16 - from boston i am the
22:18 - organizer of the metro west
22:20 - massachusetts free code camp meetup and
22:22 - um
22:23 - that's a tough one quincy i think my
22:26 - short and near-term goals are not only
22:28 - grow up my my meet up group but also to
22:31 - help all of free code camp students in
22:34 - some really unique ways
22:38 - hello i'm selig i'm from lima peru and
22:40 - my
22:42 - well i actually organized meetups in
22:44 - over there in south america and my
22:47 - short and medium term goals are
22:50 - organizing more meetups making them
22:52 - weekly on a weekly basis
22:54 - and making different
22:57 - not not different kind of me different
22:59 - kind of meetups like one meetup is just
23:01 - going doing the free code com curriculum
23:03 - the next meetup maybe a hackathon based
23:05 - on the stack that where
24:16 - okay good we're good okay yeah so i'm
24:19 - stuart i'm a developer for free code
24:21 - camp and my short term goal is to help
24:24 - free cal camp expand its reach around
24:26 - the world
24:29 - uh hi i'm mark
24:31 - i run a local group in austin
24:56 - since we're starting the stream
25:06 - okay so once again i'm mark from oslo
25:09 - norway and i run local uh local group uh
25:12 - there we have wonderful people there and
25:14 - we are preparing now for our second

25:20 - about it yeah thanks
25:24 - so uh i'm bill sure from ottawa canada
25:27 - and
25:28 - yeah canada
25:31 - and uh the short-term goal is uh just
25:33 - continue uh mentoring and helping as
25:35 - many devs as i can through articles on
25:37 - the free code camp blog and through my
25:39 - newsletter etc and probably soon-ish
25:43 - build uh build an online course to help
25:45 - people even more so that's the plan
25:49 - hello i'm george from tokyo japan
25:52 - i am an organizer of the tgif free code
25:56 - camp you can find us
25:58 - meetup site
26:00 - and we have every friday
26:03 - we have been meeting in tokyo
26:05 - thank you
26:09 - hi i'm tim from colombo sri lanka
26:13 - currently i'm working with a
26:15 - skills skill registration platform using
26:18 - blockchain so my short term goal i'm
26:20 - wondering whether we could register
26:22 - skills and certificates making free code
26:24 - camp in this particular platform so
26:26 - that's what i'm working on right now
26:28 - thank you
26:32 - hi i'm michael semko i'm from new york
26:34 - and i run a frico camp meetup group here
26:38 - on two days a week
26:40 - and as far as short-term goals go uh
26:44 - it's really it's really hard to say
26:45 - because there's many conflicting ones
26:47 - and they keep overlapping with each
26:48 - other but one of the ones that popped
26:50 - into my head right now is i would like
26:52 - to do more targeted talks on different
26:54 - specific things like filling gaps in
26:56 - knowledge
26:57 - um fill in gaps in knowledge that people
26:59 - might have for example how do you how do
27:01 - you start using git because you need to
27:03 - start using git if you haven't been
27:04 - doing it already how do you tie react
27:07 - and redux together how do you transition
27:08 - from just being a front end to front end
27:10 - and back end you know things like this
27:12 - that i feel like i'm missing in some
27:14 - people um
27:15 - also i would like to get involved with
27:16 - the development of the curriculum one
27:18 - but you know whenever
27:21 - yeah medium term goal yep
27:24 - so i'm victoria carriolic and i'm here
27:27 - in new york city as well i help mike
27:29 - occasionally with the
27:31 - tuesdays and thursday meet up groups
27:32 - that we have every week we've been
27:34 - running that for three years thanks to
27:35 - mike
27:37 - uh short-term goal in addition to what
27:39 - mike said possibly we'd like to get a
27:42 - hackathon going similar to what oslo has
27:44 - done they have a great medium article
27:46 - and i'm planning on going through that
27:47 - and coming up with something
27:50 - might as well get rid of
27:52 - yeah
27:53 - another new york person
27:55 - i'm megan i work with the new york city
27:57 - group i'm an admin for the facebook
27:59 - group and last year i was running
28:01 - saturday meetups
28:02 - but those weren't doing so hot
28:04 - so now it's just sort of like pop-up
28:06 - meetups
28:07 - uh and as far as my goals for free code
28:09 - camp it'd be same thing as mike and
28:11 - victoria i think we need more sort of
28:13 - specialized meetups rather than just
28:14 - generalized study groups so that we can
28:16 - talk about specific topics or get
28:17 - together and all just commit to hacking
28:20 - for a few hours at a time rather than
28:21 - just two hours on a week night
28:24 - so yeah same thing they said
28:28 - hello campers my name is jennifer bland
28:30 - i'm from atlanta georgia
28:33 - one thing that i want to contribute on
28:35 - is i was recently selected into the
28:37 - node.js mentorship program
28:40 - they're doing this now they're trying to
28:42 - get more people to contribute to open
28:44 - source code
28:45 - especially with node.js and they started
28:48 - it in a beta phase where they only
28:50 - selected four people out of 800 and i
28:52 - was one of the four i'm writing articles
28:55 - about it you will be seeing on the um
28:57 - publication i'm also creating videos
28:59 - about my experience and that so that i
29:02 - can share that with other campers so
29:03 - that they can learn as they're learning
29:05 - how to code how they can go back and
29:07 - contribute to open source and show them
29:09 - how easy it is to be able to do that so
29:12 - thank you
29:13 - thank you
29:14 - thanks jennifer
29:16 - hi everybody my name is abby and i'm

31:41 - hi hello i'm johnny bissell from leeds
31:44 - in england
31:47 - what can i say
31:49 - i'm really glad to be here to meet

31:58 - you actually meet and talk to people in

32:56 - professional and i free code camp led me
32:59 - from completing a free uh front-end
33:01 - certification and going right into being
33:03 - a sql and t-sql developer professionally
33:06 - and um
33:07 - so now i'm trying to wrap my head around
33:09 - this whole world of data
33:11 - and so now i'm trying to learn python
33:13 - and more of sql and more microsoft stack
33:16 - so that's more professional what i'm
33:18 - trying to do in the last year
33:21 - by way of the meetup i started to meet
33:23 - up i think right when
33:25 - norfolk free code camp meet up right
33:27 - when quincy put out a call for local
33:30 - groups to start up so it's been about
33:31 - four years now i think i think that's
33:33 - when i started
33:35 - free code camp itself so
33:37 - um what we've been doing the last year
33:39 - has been
33:40 - we've been kind of sporadic as far as
33:42 - having a meet up every month and it
33:43 - would be on different topics like one
33:45 - would be like on ios development another
33:47 - one would be
33:48 - um
33:50 - react or something like that so we'd be
33:51 - getting new groups every time but it
33:53 - doesn't seem like anybody was getting
33:54 - any traction so i've been trying to do
33:57 - one every two weeks
33:58 - virtually just on google hangouts and
34:00 - just doing working through algorithms
34:02 - working through projects doing show and
34:04 - tells and i think that's been a big help
34:06 - because everybody can work through the
34:07 - curriculum together so that's what we're
34:09 - going to keep trying to do
34:13 - hi i'm going faraday indianapolis
34:16 - indiana
34:17 - and my goal right now is to finish
34:20 - working on the react native curriculum
34:23 - and perhaps do some
34:24 - of the blockchain or help with the
34:26 - blockchain curriculum in the future
34:31 - hi my name is manish
34:34 - i'm a i'm a grad student in university
34:37 - of cincinnati ohio
34:39 - my short term goal is to graduate in
34:40 - december and hopefully look for a job as
34:42 - a java developer and also i want to
34:44 - contribute more actively to the free
34:46 - code come back end i've uh contributed
34:49 - quite a lot to the front end and it's
34:52 - it's been interesting to move towards
34:53 - the back end and also i would like to be
34:55 - more active in the help rooms i've kind
34:57 - of been active there and
35:00 - try to help more people so yeah
35:03 - yeah steve james shout out to you
35:06 - hey everybody it's jesse from live
35:08 - coding with jesse
35:10 - and
35:13 - i think
35:14 - it'd be cool to maybe do one live stream
35:16 - where i don't mess anything up that
35:18 - would be a good goal
35:19 - and
35:20 - tell me how that goes
35:22 - yeah
35:23 - and for this for the live streams i'd
35:25 - really love to get to a thousand hours
35:27 - of streaming i think that would be
35:28 - awesome we're definitely i think we're
35:30 - pushing 300 now i haven't counted in a
35:32 - while
35:33 - and uh locally i really want to get a
35:36 - free code camp meetup started i forgot
35:38 - to tell you where i'm from originally
35:40 - from west virginia
35:41 - now i live in ohio
35:43 - but it's really close to pittsburgh so
35:45 - they all they all connect right there
35:48 - so
35:49 - anyway i think i'm the last one
35:52 - so
35:53 - i hope you all enjoy this stream
35:56 - [Music]
36:03 - all right everyone well
36:06 - yeah oh yeah we should
36:10 - all right how do you hold this thing

36:39 - live stream for the music
36:41 - and that's
36:42 - basically just sitting down there 24
36:44 - hours a day with me doing nothing it's
36:46 - sitting in a closet somewhere on a
36:48 - computer and
36:49 - pumping up those hours
36:51 - you've got a long way to go if you're
36:53 - only at 300 hours
36:56 - uh and yeah if there's any problems with
36:58 - the stream tonight i'm the one to blame
37:01 - hey thank you so much everybody uh
37:03 - huge round of applause for everybody who

37:09 - [Applause]
37:11 - and
37:12 - also
37:12 - i just want to thank you all for
37:14 - everything you're doing it's
37:17 - it's amazing we were looking at the
37:18 - analytics for free code camp recently
37:21 - and we are free co camp is
37:24 - according to similar web which
37:26 - aggregates all all the different
37:28 - uh places we're getting something like
37:30 - 15 million visits a month
37:34 - and a lot of that is to medium a lot of
37:36 - that is to the core curriculum to the
37:38 - free code camp guide we've got quite a
37:39 - few people who've contributed the guide
37:41 - here
37:42 - and
37:44 - a vast majority of
37:46 - the things to do in the free cocaine
37:48 - community are powered
37:50 - by wonderful volunteers
37:53 - like you all wonderful contributors so i
37:56 - just want to have another big round of
37:57 - applause for everybody here
38:00 - [Applause]
38:06 - and i also want to have a round of
38:07 - applause
38:08 - for all the free code cam contributors
38:11 - who couldn't fly out to new york city
38:13 - uh i totally understand it's expensive
38:16 - to fly out and get a hotel in new york
38:17 - city
38:18 - and all the contributors who
38:21 - all the 2018 top contributors who are
38:24 - going to be
38:25 - at the dublin event next month
38:29 - and the hong kong event in november
38:31 - so we're very excited we just confirmed
38:33 - the date of the dublin event it's going

38:39 - in downtown dublin at a very nice
38:42 - co-working space

38:45 - space the rough draft and
38:48 - it's going to be a ton of fun and
38:50 - everybody who's watching who
38:52 - has contributed to free code camp or
38:54 - who's considering contributing to free
38:55 - code camp
38:56 - i just want to encourage you to do so so
38:59 - you can be in the same room with these
39:00 - amazing people
39:02 - it's such an electrifying feeling being
39:04 - here
39:05 - so
39:06 - i think at this point it's worth
39:08 - pointing out that we have
39:10 - a ton of really good catered food over
39:12 - here
39:15 - we also have
39:16 - tons of soda and wine and beer if you're
39:19 - 21 or older
39:22 - and
39:23 - uh
39:23 - we're gonna be hanging out here until
39:26 - about
39:27 - 10
39:28 - 10 and then if anybody still feels
39:30 - energy we might go to a nearby
39:32 - dessert place or cafe or bar or
39:35 - someplace that we can still talk it's
39:36 - not terribly loud
39:38 - but
39:39 - if anybody's up for that i mean if you
39:40 - flew all the way out from
39:42 - uh from peru
39:44 - or
39:45 - you know from oslo or all these
39:48 - far-flung parts of the world
39:50 - very far from new york city you should
39:52 - absolutely
39:55 - you should absolutely uh get the most of
39:57 - this and tomorrow
39:59 - as promised there will be a fun run
40:02 - we're going to run both across the

40:06 - and the manhattan bridge
40:09 - so it's a it's about 10k
40:11 - you can total we can totally have like a
40:13 - walking or walk run division as well

40:34 - pretty new i hadn't seen it before but
40:36 - we went there yesterday and it was just
40:38 - the most
40:40 - solemn kind of
40:42 - humbling experience
40:44 - this this memorial so it's definitely
40:46 - worth checking out while you're here in

40:50 - and uh so at this point feel free to
40:53 - just shake your neighbor's hand we have
40:55 - a little badge game

41:00 - five
41:02 - and yes there are more than one color it
41:05 - was a random draw and a lot of people
41:06 - got blue
41:09 - all right
41:15 - oh so
41:16 - we'll talk with
41:18 - if you're wondering about python uh

41:22 - published an amazing four and a half
41:24 - hour video
41:26 - which you can check out it's like a
41:27 - total python tutorial with code samples
41:30 - and everything that's on our channel
41:32 - you can watch that after you watch the
41:33 - stream or you can watch it right now if
41:35 - you want just watch it concurrently
41:37 - um and we will have an announcement
41:40 - about a forthcoming python curriculum in
41:42 - a little bit
41:44 - uh coming from ethan arrowood who's been
41:46 - working on it for the past few months
41:48 - so yeah
41:50 - exciting stuff in the pipes we've got so

56:10 - mark welcome
56:13 - i'm gonna pull you up on here so
56:14 - everybody can see your information
56:17 - because
56:18 - i mean matthew built this amazing app
56:20 - why not make heavy use of it right
56:22 - um
56:23 - one second
56:32 - okay
56:33 - pretty cool huh yeah so i just scroll
56:35 - through here i find
56:36 - mark
56:39 - i hear a lot of people on here
56:41 - we went ahead and put all the top
56:42 - contributors just in case people showed
56:43 - up
56:44 - here we are
56:47 - so i'm here with
56:48 - mark uh how do you pronounce your last
56:50 - name drostinski
56:54 - i'm here with mark troshinsky
56:56 - and mark is uh the community organizer
57:00 - for free co-camp oslo
57:02 - which tell me a little bit about free
57:04 - code camp oslo and its history
57:07 - okay so we have a amazing group okay
57:10 - amazing group of people and also other
57:12 - admins
57:13 - uh very active in oslo uh we figured
57:16 - that
57:17 - mondays are the last competitive
57:20 - date along the week with other events
57:23 - which are happening more on the end of
57:25 - the week and during weekends so we
57:27 - figured that you know most of people
57:29 - don't have plans uh at the beginning of
57:31 - the week so we figured that monday is
57:33 - our perfect cause and we are just
57:35 - keeping it uh regular and
57:37 - you know you know the persistence is the
57:39 - the key for
57:40 - our our group so so you know like yeah
57:43 - yeah around a year ago there was like
57:45 - you know
57:46 - meetups with only me or just two people
57:48 - or three people and now we have like uh
57:51 - 15 16 people attending every every week
57:54 - so so that's that's really a progress
57:56 - for us
57:57 - that's amazing so 15 or 16 people coming
58:00 - to your average event how frequently do
58:03 - you all get together
58:04 - every week
58:05 - every week every monday
58:07 - every monday okay so you've got a
58:08 - regular schedule you've chosen to try to
58:11 - get a set rhythm so everybody knows hey
58:13 - it's monday time to go to pre-co camp
58:15 - oslo whatever happens we have a meet-up
58:16 - and you know even when i'm here we have
58:19 - also richard
58:24 - yeah so we have also besides me uh we
58:26 - have also very active me admins uh like
58:29 - richard milton catherine and ikanova uh
58:32 - howie anderson who are organizing so if
58:36 - any one of us cannot attend the meet up
58:39 - we also have other guys who are
58:41 - who are there for people who are wanting
58:43 - who want to see how does it look like
58:45 - and how to how to get into it
58:49 - awesome and have very many people within
58:52 - uh the community over time have have any
58:55 - of them gotten jobs as developers
58:58 - yeah so we have like quite you know
59:00 - small successes in our in our group so
59:02 - you know besides you know learning uh
59:06 - learning purposes of community as as
59:08 - ours there are also uh network effect
59:11 - right so
59:12 - some some people in our community
59:14 - already work in in some companies
59:17 - and we know about you know
59:20 - some job offers
59:22 - within these companies or some
59:24 - internships that are up here so so we
59:27 - can we can connect people between
59:29 - companies and between themselves to to
59:32 - try to collaborate and you know when you
59:34 - are meeting people a lot of people are
59:36 - quite shy and
59:38 - delaying their uh job application right
59:40 - so when we see them on our meetups every
59:43 - week we are pushing them to to actually
59:45 - start applying and pushing them to those
59:47 - people who are actually in industry and
59:50 - and you know make that connection as
59:52 - soon as possible
59:55 - what are some initiatives you've done
59:57 - outside of just having the weekly
59:59 - events have you all had any hackathons
60:01 - or anything like that
60:03 - yeah we just finished our first
60:04 - hackathon but it wasn't like a
60:07 - traditional
60:09 - hackathon when you have separate groups
60:11 - working on separate projects and
60:12 - competing with each other to win some
60:14 - prize since we have like mostly uh
60:17 - beginners in our group we wanted to show
60:19 - them how actually the software is being
60:21 - developed now
60:22 - so like
60:23 - in teams because when you are learning
60:25 - you primarily learn on some your your
60:27 - small projects in a local in your local
60:29 - environment and you don't uh
60:32 - you don't cooperate with other people so
60:34 - we wanted to show them how to cooperate
60:36 - on using github you know how to split
60:38 - into teams and one team is responsible
60:41 - for back-end one team is responsible
60:42 - from front-end one team is responsible
60:44 - for server side of the project and we
60:47 - collaborate together to assemble some
60:49 - working piece of software uh so because
60:51 - you know when we are meeting uh
60:54 - every every week we spend together like
60:55 - two three four hours and it's not enough
60:57 - time to actually build something
60:59 - constructive from scratch so we wanted
61:01 - to dedicate the whole day or whole
61:03 - weekend or so we just made a poll on on
61:06 - facebook group and we decided that we
61:08 - just spent the whole saturday uh coding
61:10 - on and collaborating on one project and
61:13 - it was very pleasant surprise that
61:16 - actually we built some actually moving
61:18 - living
61:20 - fully functioning piece of software it's
61:22 - not perfect it's it's still have a lot
61:24 - of work to do within it but it's
61:26 - completely
61:26 - complete piece of software what kind of
61:28 - software did you build
61:29 - uh it was a simple
61:33 - pre-code comp localizer
61:35 - so
61:36 - it just allows you to
61:38 - you have a map and you you are allowed
61:40 - to add your pin and add a label to it
61:43 - and you can just the purpose of it is
61:45 - that you can select your location when
61:47 - you are
61:48 - spending time and learning to cover
61:50 - because a lot of people are learning in
61:51 - cafes and stuff like that so you can
61:54 - just
61:54 - add your pin that you are in starbucks
61:57 - at this and this location and you are
61:59 - open for collaboration so other people
62:01 - who are visiting that website see other
62:03 - people pins
62:04 - with labels that sounds really cool the
62:07 - way that people can potentially opt into
62:09 - hey i'm here i'm going to be coding for
62:11 - the next few hours
62:12 - come in hang out with me and i i use the
62:14 - app and i was really impressed with how
62:16 - robust it was
62:18 - for the product of a weekend hackathon
62:20 - it sounds like you had a lot of time and
62:23 - a lot of energy
62:38 - also help other people who are less
62:41 - experienced to
62:43 - help them to get their feet wet right so
62:45 - some
62:46 - programming was uh was involved because
62:49 - you know
62:50 - it wasn't like all the participants were
62:53 - working separately
62:55 - we were doing
62:57 - pieces of the project in pairs or in
62:59 - in the groups of three people so you
63:02 - know we had like
63:04 - this
63:05 - kind of more experienced people
63:06 - responsible for a particular area and we
63:09 - were trying to assemble it with help of
63:11 - with other people who are involved were
63:14 - involved so
63:15 - it was it was a nice idea to try and we
63:17 - all of participants enjoyed it so i
63:20 - think we will try to do it again
63:23 - awesome well uh aside from doing
63:26 - hackathons
63:27 - do you all have any other goals for the
63:29 - near future for what pre-co camp also is
63:32 - going to try to tackle in
63:35 - the last half of 2018
63:39 - we started collaborating with
63:41 - other companies that are in based in
63:44 - oslo so they're
63:45 - the star-type community in uh oslo
63:48 - itself is quite rapidly growing because
63:49 - you know the norwegian norwegian
63:51 - industry is based primarily in oil in
63:54 - recent years but they are noticed they
63:56 - noticed the uh you know
63:58 - the future that is ahead of us and they
64:01 - are trying to switch from
64:03 - oil-based industry to into i.t so they
64:06 - are investing a lot of money and a lot
64:08 - of
64:09 - resources to
64:10 - uh to to uh try to support local
64:14 - initiatives like that so we are working
64:16 - with uh we are collaborating with
64:18 - explorer hq which is a like like
64:20 - community and hub of
64:22 - companies collaborating on uh various
64:24 - projects and also other hubs and and
64:27 - startup
64:28 - incubators to you know just to be in the
64:31 - environment and know what is happening
64:34 - in our city
64:36 - awesome well how about you personally
64:38 - tell me a little bit about your career
64:40 - trajectory and your near-term goals okay
64:43 - so i i work in i.t like for 10 years but
64:47 - on management side so right now i'm a
64:50 - software project manager in one of the
64:53 - companies in oslo
64:55 - but i you know i felt constantly that
64:57 - imposter syndrome that i don't have
64:59 - enough full understanding of the things
65:01 - that i'm responsible for that's why i
65:03 - started to learning to code to expand my
65:06 - technical skills and to understand it
65:07 - better
65:08 - so you know and i also have some ideas
65:11 - for for my own projects and i can either
65:14 - pay someone to build it for me or i can
65:16 - learn that skills and build it by myself
65:18 - right
65:19 - absolutely that's the right way to think
65:21 - of it so
65:22 - uh
65:23 - how long have you been coding
65:26 - for i think like regular for
65:29 - around the year because when you know i
65:30 - i work full-time so i can dedicate
65:34 - some limited time for it so just like
65:36 - evenings and some part of the weekends
65:38 - so it's not going uh very
65:41 - fast but i'm trying to make some gradual
65:44 - progress in my learning
65:46 - yeah absolutely learning the code is a
65:48 - marathon it's not a sprint and it sounds
65:49 - like you're approaching that with that
65:51 - mindset
65:52 - so
65:52 - uh have you yet had a chance to apply
65:55 - any of your coding skills to your
65:57 - i.t management job
65:59 - yeah like i started i got interested
66:01 - with
66:02 - that more technical skills when i tried
66:05 - to
66:06 - approach uh
66:07 - our developers in my previous projects
66:09 - and ask them for some data and i felt
66:12 - that like the things that i'm asking
66:14 - them is are very simple and i can
66:16 - actually grab that data if i if i learn
66:19 - some basics of sql so i just started
66:22 - learning sql to be able to
66:24 - dig into in our data and find the
66:26 - answers that i want to that i want to
66:28 - get
66:29 - so even as a technical project manager
66:32 - you've managed to turn around and
66:33 - immediately
66:34 - uh
66:35 - as an i.t manager you've you've managed
66:37 - to immediately apply
66:39 - some of your technical skills
66:41 - on the job
66:42 - yeah yeah that's the plan to you know
66:44 - just make it make that transition quite
66:47 - credible
66:48 - that's great and the fact that you've
66:49 - been able to do all this without taking
66:51 - any additional risk
66:53 - you haven't left your job you haven't
66:55 - taken any sort of pay cuts you're just
66:56 - doing the same thing you were doing
66:58 - before but now you're moving in a more
66:59 - technical direction that's just that's
67:01 - that's the idea
67:03 - well i think that uh i'm going to
67:05 - encourage everybody to
67:07 - jump on twitter and follow mark i think
67:11 - that he is a
67:12 - very inspiring person within the free
67:15 - co-camp community i've really enjoyed
67:17 - using your hackathon project
67:19 - i am
67:20 - very interested in scandinavia in
67:22 - general i think a lot of america is
67:24 - looking at scandinavia as potentially
67:26 - being a model of going forward
67:29 - feel invited and drop by whenever you're
67:31 - in
67:32 - yeah and i i absolutely hope to to visit
67:34 - scandinavia in the next year or two um
67:37 - it we have a lot of free co game study
67:39 - groups up there and
67:40 - yeah uh
67:42 - keep doing what you're doing it's
67:43 - amazing yeah we'll do
67:45 - uh and hopefully you will join us soon
67:47 - and we'll be in in europe and uh yeah
67:50 - because we have like
67:51 - the oslo group is just one of them we
67:53 - have a couple of other groups in in
67:55 - other cities in norway but there are as
67:57 - i
67:58 - try to look for other groups there are
68:00 - also multiple groups in whole europe so
68:02 - so there are definitely communities
68:04 - similar to ours
68:05 - great well we need to have some sort of
68:07 - pre-co camp wide europe summit but we're
68:09 - going to have an event in dublin is
68:11 - there any chance that you'll be able to
68:12 - make it to the free cooking of dublin
68:13 - event i'll try i think maybe richard
68:16 - richard nelton would try to reach it one
68:18 - of our mid uh admins in oslo uh but you
68:22 - know i i just i i'm not sure if i will
68:24 - be able to make it financially but you
68:26 - know if i would and only have an
68:28 - opportunity i would definitely join that
68:30 - great well and and just for some context
68:32 - richard milton
68:33 - he is a
68:35 - another top contributor who will be at
68:37 - the dublin event and he runs free
68:39 - cocaine's instagram
68:40 - page which if you haven't checked it out
68:42 - yet uh check it out instagram.com
68:45 - freecodecamp and a lot of the photos on
68:47 - there from free cocaine baslow right
68:48 - yeah yeah there's a lot of
68:50 - content from our journey and from uh
68:53 - middle uh richard uh richard experiences
68:56 - so so and he
68:57 - as i see he runs it with uh huge success
69:01 - because you know the the amount of uh
69:04 - uh activity there is quite quite amazing
69:06 - compared to other
69:08 - similarly uh
69:10 - similar topics there well thank you so
69:12 - much mark for flying all the way out to
69:14 - new york city and joining us thank you
69:16 - for leading the pre-co cam oscilla study
69:19 - group and thanks for
69:21 - thinking about all these new ways that
69:22 - people can collaborate in real time and
69:25 - learn together thank you thank you
69:26 - quincy
69:27 - [Music]
69:29 - thank you all right cheers
69:37 - welcome megan uh i'm gonna pull up your
69:40 - information here if anybody's interested
69:41 - in uh
69:43 - and learning a little bit more about
69:44 - megan
69:47 - so
69:48 - [Music]
69:50 - your your last name is pronounced malloy
69:52 - all right perfect
69:54 - well megan you've been involved in free
69:56 - code camp here in new york city for
69:57 - quite a while
69:59 - could you describe your involvement so
70:01 - far yeah
70:02 - so when i first joined free code camp it
70:05 - was in part because i wanted to learn
70:06 - how to code i had been doing a little
70:08 - bit of coding in visual basics already
70:10 - and wanted to do something that was a
70:12 - little bit more relevant for you know
70:14 - the 2000s um
70:17 - and i also wanted to get to know some
70:19 - new people because i just moved to new
70:20 - york city so it seemed like a good way
70:22 - to get some learning as well as get to
70:24 - meet some people so i started going to
70:26 - the free code camp meetups and working
70:27 - through the curriculum it really helps
70:29 - like keep me honest keep me going
70:31 - through because every time i go to the
70:32 - meetups everybody wants to check on you
70:34 - and see like how far have you gotten and
70:36 - if you're still doing the same project
70:37 - you were doing two weeks ago
70:39 - it feels a little bad to say that's
70:41 - other people
70:42 - so it's a good way to make sure that i
70:44 - was making progress and as well as get
70:46 - help from other people and then as i got
70:48 - more and more confident also helped to
70:50 - go and to talk to other people who are
70:52 - working through the same challenges and
70:53 - then have to explain the process to them
70:55 - as well and really solidify that
70:57 - knowledge so that's how i got sort of
70:59 - first involved in the meetups i was just
71:02 - going as a student
71:04 - and then
71:05 - after a few months
71:07 - victoria and mike were looking for
71:08 - somebody to run another meetup on
71:10 - weekends
71:11 - so i volunteered for that and started
71:14 - running a saturday meet up for the last
71:17 - two years
71:18 - but attendance is sort of mixed because
71:20 - people have things to do on saturdays
71:23 - so
71:23 - now i'm just kind of doing like pop-up
71:25 - meetups so whenever i have some time
71:28 - i'll say i'm going to be at this place
71:29 - in two hours if anybody else wants to
71:31 - meet up there
71:32 - and then
71:33 - we can just code together on whatever
71:36 - we're working on that day
71:39 - awesome and uh these these pop-up
71:41 - meetups how long have you been doing
71:43 - that and and how has it been so far what
71:45 - have you in your experiences with them
71:47 - so so far it's been i've only met with a
71:49 - couple of people for the pop-up ones i
71:51 - started doing it in march
71:54 - because until march i was doing just
71:56 - regular saturday meetups
71:58 - um so i think just for my schedule
72:00 - personally it's much more convenient for
72:02 - me to say like here's a time when i
72:04 - would like to dedicate to coding and
72:06 - really focus on that more
72:08 - rather than having a set time and i
72:10 - think it works a little better for other
72:11 - people as well because it's not the same
72:13 - time every day so you can get different
72:15 - people to come to it because they're all
72:17 - available at different times as well and
72:18 - we can change up the location and so a
72:21 - lot more variety for other people to
72:23 - potentially attend and much more
72:25 - convenient for my personal schedule
72:28 - yeah that sounds great and how about
72:29 - your own learning uh have you you've
72:32 - been learning a little bit on your own
72:33 - as time permits
72:35 - yeah so i did the whole front-end
72:37 - certificate through free code camp and
72:38 - then after that
72:40 - i got a little sidetracked i wasn't sure
72:42 - what i wanted to do i did part of a
72:43 - course on ruby on rails through udemy i
72:46 - started working through a little bit of
72:47 - the back end stuff on pre-code camp and
72:49 - started learning d3 at the same time
72:52 - this year i was able to finish the
72:54 - course i was doing in d3 through udemy
72:58 - so that was
72:59 - uh that felt good to get that out of the
73:01 - way
73:02 - and now at this point i'm sort of trying
73:04 - to decide on exactly what i want to
73:06 - learn because i've been sort of learning
73:08 - a little bit of different things still
73:09 - working with a little bit of d3 i picked
73:12 - up a book on data science so i really
73:14 - need to get focused still
73:16 - but definitely a lot more learning to be
73:18 - had
73:20 - yeah and so
73:22 - learning data visualization you're
73:24 - learning a little bit about data science
73:26 - do you think that's the direction you
73:27 - might be interested in going
73:29 - yeah so right now i'm a data analyst so
73:31 - it's sort of related to my current
73:33 - career and i think ultimately i'd like
73:35 - to do something more like data
73:37 - journalism like the stuff that 538 does
73:39 - where you can have interactive
73:40 - visualizations as well as some research
73:42 - backing it up and telling a story using
73:44 - data
73:46 - okay and
73:49 - for people who are watching and they're
73:50 - interested in finding like a really good
73:52 - data visualization that's really
73:54 - impressive and kind of highlights the
73:57 - power of data journalism which is still
73:59 - pretty nascent uh
74:01 - i've been looking at some amazing stuff
74:03 - coming out of new york times
74:05 - which is where d3 was created by mike
74:07 - bostock
74:08 - what would be a good
74:10 - data journalism piece that they could
74:12 - google that they might be able to get a
74:14 - better feel for the field from
74:16 - so a lot of the stuff that 538 does is
74:19 - really great and their election stuff
74:20 - they have some interactive articles
74:23 - the i think the new york times runs the
74:25 - upshot which is more data journalism
74:27 - focused
74:29 - so some of their stuff is really great
74:30 - and i think they have some interesting
74:31 - ways to really engage readers like when
74:33 - you're scrolling through a page it'll
74:34 - load like a new piece to a chart so
74:36 - it'll tell you about the factors that
74:38 - contribute to global warming and you'll
74:40 - see like here's carbon emissions from
74:43 - cars and then you scroll down the page
74:45 - and you're reading about carbon
74:46 - emissions from cars and then this other
74:48 - layer of the chart pops in and it's like
74:50 - airplanes and they tell you about
74:52 - airplanes
74:53 - so really sort of engaging the reader
74:56 - with some animation and in the chart as
74:59 - you go through the page
75:01 - awesome well
75:02 - our data visualization section on free
75:04 - codecamp is still pretty rough
75:07 - we have a lot of information on using d3
75:09 - and svg and stuff like that but
75:12 - i think in terms of applied data
75:14 - visualization
75:16 - uh as a as a skill and some basic
75:19 - principles that that people should apply
75:22 - when they're trying to build
75:23 - visualizations
75:24 - that is definitely ripe for expansion so
75:28 - if you're interested in finding an area
75:30 - of pre-co camp that you could
75:31 - potentially contribute to in the future
75:33 - certainly the curriculum would benefit
75:34 - from your passion in that field
75:37 - you're currently working as a data
75:38 - analyst you said and
75:40 - a lot of people are
75:42 - kind of confused about the difference
75:44 - between doing data analysis and
75:47 - doing actual data science
75:49 - how would you describe the difference
75:50 - between the two fields as far as you
75:52 - understand them
75:54 - so
75:54 - in my experience i think data science is
75:56 - a little bit more on the back end doing
75:59 - a lot of calculations math and writing
76:01 - up algorithms to try to segment an
76:03 - audience or something along those lines
76:05 - and data analysis is here's all this
76:07 - data you have in front of us now tell us
76:10 - what this means to a human person and
76:12 - then in my personal experience it's been
76:13 - more like a business analysis
76:16 - so if you're looking at stats for
76:18 - different marketing campaigns how do you
76:19 - relatively compare how well each one did
76:21 - and whether you should continue
76:23 - that campaign
76:27 - if you were to hypothetically let's say
76:30 - you suddenly had you were really good
76:32 - at
76:33 - data visualization you were really good
76:35 - with this you had a strong tool set you
76:37 - had learned plenty of additional math
76:39 - beyond what you currently know and you
76:41 - could just go out and tackle any topic
76:43 - with data journalism what what area
76:46 - would you be interested in exploring
76:49 - i've been really interested in
76:50 - investigating crime statistics
76:52 - specifically since i moved to new york
76:54 - from chicago i really wanted to compare
76:56 - crime stats between the two cities for
76:58 - specific neighborhoods in each city
77:00 - because the area i lived in chicago it
77:02 - wasn't the best area but rent was cheap
77:04 - and i was willing to accept that level
77:06 - of risk and so i wanted to find an area
77:09 - in new york where it would be sort of
77:11 - similarly safe
77:13 - so that i could sort of minimize my rent
77:15 - price while still being comfortable in
77:17 - the neighborhood and it's really really
77:19 - hard to compare crime stats between
77:21 - cities because they have all these
77:22 - different categorizations for how they
77:24 - label crimes
77:26 - so i really like to dig more into that
77:28 - and try to find a way to standardize
77:29 - that a little better and make something
77:31 - that would be useful for people who are
77:33 - moving between major cities
77:36 - are there any
77:38 - data visualizations or any
77:41 - interactive
77:43 - ways to access data that you've built so
77:45 - far
77:47 - that you'd be interested in sharing
77:50 - like anything that's online that people
77:51 - could check out yet
77:53 - so i do have a website that's
77:56 - meghansolo.com and i have a couple small
77:59 - blog posts on there
78:01 - one of them is about visual basics code
78:03 - and one of them was looking at
78:05 - statistics on whether treaties trade off
78:08 - with bills in congress when like there's
78:10 - this massive bipartisanship that we've
78:12 - seen
78:13 - so like maybe congress would be passing
78:15 - more treaties because they can't get
78:16 - bills approved so may as well try to do
78:18 - something symbolic turns out there
78:20 - doesn't seem to be any sort of trade-off
78:22 - but i wrote that up anyway because i
78:24 - think
78:25 - a lot of things that are published
78:26 - nowadays you only want to publish
78:28 - something if there's flashy findings but
78:29 - we really need to make a move more to
78:31 - publishing things that say oh actually
78:33 - nothing happened here anyway
78:36 - so that's that's on my site as well
78:39 - that's great night just just to
78:42 - completely agree with what you said i
78:43 - think it'd be great if i opened the news
78:45 - and things that were obvious
78:48 - but true
78:49 - that people had just confirmed
78:51 - you know complied with people's general
78:54 - worldview and sense of common sense
78:56 - if we just had more headlines like
78:58 - guess what you know sozo really is
79:01 - the case you know uh i i agree with you
79:04 - see do you think that
79:06 - uh certainly within science the the
79:08 - drive to find novel
79:09 - and counter-intuitive findings has
79:14 - buried a lot of
79:15 - other important findings that just com
79:18 - that conform to people's expectations
79:20 - yeah i think there's definitely a lot of
79:22 - studies that just aren't as sometimes
79:25 - aren't even published because somebody
79:26 - thought that their findings weren't
79:27 - worthwhile and from what i've read this
79:30 - is actually a huge issue because that
79:31 - means that if you haven't published that
79:32 - somebody else might go repeat your work
79:34 - and then that's so much wasted time
79:36 - within the whole community
79:38 - that they could have spent looking at
79:40 - something else instead of repeating
79:41 - something that you already found out
79:44 - awesome well what are your so
79:47 - you're learning
79:48 - some additional data science stuff
79:50 - you have picked up a lot of additional
79:52 - libraries and things like that
79:54 - what would you say your near-term goals
79:55 - are for the next 18 months
79:59 - so i'm trying to get a little more
80:01 - organized and figure out what the best
80:03 - process for learning is right now my
80:05 - thought is if i could combine into some
80:07 - sort of recurring format if i could
80:09 - learn a data science concept
80:12 - find a data set that i want to work with
80:14 - and then apply that data concept that
80:16 - data science concept to that data set
80:18 - visualize it in d3 and then post a blog
80:20 - post that would be the ideal workflow
80:23 - for me um
80:24 - i just need to sort of figure out a
80:25 - cadence that would actually be
80:27 - achievable
80:28 - and whether or not that's too much stuff
80:30 - because maybe i shouldn't bother with
80:32 - the data science concepts just yet and i
80:34 - should just focus on taking a data set
80:36 - and doing something in d3 so i need to
80:38 - find what the right balance is to
80:40 - actually make it achievable while also
80:42 - still learning something
80:43 - [Music]
80:45 - awesome
80:46 - uh as far as free code camp new york
80:49 - city your efforts there first of all
80:51 - thank you so much for
80:53 - your years of
80:54 - taking the time to help people in the
80:56 - community learn to code and bring them
80:58 - together what are your ambitions on that
81:01 - front do you have any ideas for
81:03 - how we could make the precocity
81:06 - more cohesive or get people coming out
81:09 - more regularly
81:11 - so i think one of the things we've been
81:12 - talking about for a while is having more
81:14 - sort of specialized meetups so we would
81:16 - have a certain topic that we're
81:18 - addressing like mike mentioned using git
81:21 - or if we could have a hackathon like
81:23 - victoria mentioned something like that
81:24 - where there's a specific task at hand
81:27 - i think that would probably
81:29 - garner a little bit more response
81:31 - i think we also need to work on reaching
81:33 - out through different channels because
81:34 - right now we're pretty much only posting
81:36 - things on facebook and i know there's a
81:38 - lot of people in the free code camp
81:39 - community who aren't on facebook
81:41 - so we need to sort of figure out where
81:43 - are those people how can we communicate
81:44 - with them
81:47 - okay great and even though we use
81:50 - facebook as kind of critical
81:51 - infrastructure for our study groups
81:53 - facebook's group functionality is pretty
81:55 - mature and it's well built and
81:56 - maintained
81:58 - we are hoping to have
82:00 - kind of like some better functionality
82:02 - right on freecodecamp
82:03 - especially for people that don't want to
82:05 - use facebook which i totally understand
82:06 - these days um
82:08 - are there any features that you think
82:11 - just off the top of your head that would
82:12 - that we could potentially build that
82:14 - would
82:15 - make that more likely to be a success
82:19 - i think you mentioned some sort of like
82:20 - pop-up alerting that would
82:22 - like a pop-up that would tell you when
82:24 - something was about to happen within x
82:25 - hours in your area i think that would be
82:27 - really useful
82:29 - um i think even for me there's so many
82:31 - different sections of pre-code camp that
82:33 - it's hard to keep track of all of them
82:34 - so like i didn't even know that the
82:35 - guide existed until yesterday when you
82:37 - talked about it
82:39 - so sort of that discoverability aspect
82:41 - definitely needs to be a focus when
82:44 - we're thinking about alerting for events
82:46 - um because if there's just a whole new
82:48 - section where there's just this is the
82:50 - event section then that might be hard
82:52 - for people to find and get to know
82:54 - um but i know push notifications can
82:56 - also get really annoying so yeah have to
82:58 - find the the right balance there
83:02 - yeah we're gonna we're we're gonna try
83:04 - to find like a good kind of equilibrium
83:06 - where we're not bugging people too much
83:09 - but we are
83:10 - giving them some insight into like the
83:12 - different sections and
83:13 - different contributions going on and
83:15 - right now what we're doing on the
83:16 - youtube channel i'm i'm hoping that a
83:17 - lot of the people who watch this both
83:19 - live and after the fact will
83:21 - realize oh wow there's a vibrant new
83:22 - york city group oh oh there's a data
83:25 - visualization section you know data
83:27 - journalism is the thing a lot of people
83:29 - aren't even familiar with that concept
83:30 - and it's so new
83:32 - so
83:33 - taking the time to talk with people like
83:35 - you megan uh makes a huge difference i'm
83:38 - gonna pull up your information and put
83:40 - it on the screen again
83:41 - uh everybody
83:43 - i strongly recommend you uh
83:47 - you track down megan malloy if you just
83:49 - google megan malloy nyc what would be a
83:52 - good way for people to find you out
83:53 - there
83:54 - i think i'm one of two people with this
83:56 - name
83:57 - so hopefully i think my website pops up
84:00 - within the first page of google so
84:03 - find out
84:04 - all right everybody check out meghan
84:05 - malloy i pumped her name up and thank
84:08 - you again megan for everything you're
84:10 - doing
84:27 - yeah welcome have a seat man uh is the
84:30 - sound coming through it's pretty loud
84:32 - okay perfect
84:33 - [Music]
84:37 - hey how's the audio everybody just
84:39 - messaging the chat if the audio is good
84:43 - okay cool
84:57 - [Music]
85:01 - oh
85:04 - [Music]
85:14 - uh it looks like it may not be advancing
85:15 - i don't know yeah it is
85:35 - awesome thank you for confirming that
85:37 - everybody watching
85:38 - uh around the world
85:40 - so
85:41 - i'm here with a very special contributor
85:44 - i'm gonna pull your name up uh just so
85:46 - everybody can see your twitter handle
85:47 - and everything
85:49 - i'm doing this manually with this
85:51 - amazing tool that matthew the av
85:54 - extraordinaire created
85:56 - um
85:57 - ethan arrowood
86:00 - welcome
86:01 - to uh the live stream
86:03 - and
86:05 - you hail from boston you are a
86:09 - student there an undergraduate student
86:11 - yes
86:12 - yes uh undergrad student at wentworth
86:14 - institute of technology
86:16 - tell us a little bit about your
86:18 - currently you're an intern yes and yeah
86:21 - tell us a little bit about it yes so i'm
86:24 - an intern um at microsoft in cambridge i
86:27 - am on the
86:28 - commercial software engineering team and
86:31 - it's a incredible opportunity um and a
86:33 - very unique internship so rather than
86:36 - working on a specific product or
86:39 - a specific service that microsoft offers
86:41 - such as azure or office um i work in
86:44 - this like almost a hackathon kind of way
86:47 - where we work with some of the top azure
86:49 - clients and if they have any sort of
86:52 - data sets they want analyzed or worked
86:54 - on or they have problems they want
86:56 - solutions to or new applications
86:59 - microsoft will assemble a crew
87:01 - developers from the csc team and we go
87:04 - out and we build something really cool
87:06 - with them for a week or two weeks and
87:08 - then when we're all done
87:10 - we hand it off to them we show them how
87:11 - to use it we provide documentation and a
87:14 - lot of what we do write gets open source
87:16 - or at least we talk about it we write
87:18 - blog posts about it
87:20 - i'm based in cambridge like i said but i
87:23 - actually was here in new york this past
87:25 - week
87:26 - at the new york office working on a very
87:29 - incredible project doing some docker and
87:31 - kubernetes as well as some react code um
87:34 - and it's been the best internship i've
87:36 - ever i could have ever asked for
87:39 - awesome well how did you get the
87:40 - internship yeah
87:42 - so um twitter actually i was i loved
87:46 - tweeting about tech free code camp
87:48 - especially and contributing to open
87:50 - source was what really caught the eye of
87:52 - my now manager he was also an alumni
87:56 - from my university wentworth and when he
87:59 - found me on twitter he reached out we
88:01 - connected um and through that connection
88:04 - i got into the interview process and
88:05 - then during the interview process for
88:07 - this team specifically they were really
88:08 - impressed with what i did in regards to
88:11 - open source as a college student and so
88:15 - from that they i made it through
88:17 - thankfully and now i'm having a very
88:19 - great experience
88:22 - that's great so
88:24 - just by doing what you love contributing
88:27 - to open source sharing information
88:30 - you caught the eye of microsoft did you
88:32 - apply for the internship or did they
88:34 - reach out to you and ask you to apply
88:36 - how did that go down yeah so i put my
88:38 - application in online like anyone else
88:41 - would and then once my application was
88:43 - in their system and my name was in their
88:44 - system um i don't know the exact
88:47 - specifics but i did get to go visit the
88:49 - office um and my manager uh his name is
88:52 - ben um and ben did bring me in and he
88:55 - showed me around and
88:57 - um i don't know exactly what connections
88:59 - he made but i don't know if it's exactly
89:01 - a coincidence that i wound up on his
89:04 - team
89:04 - literally working for him so um there
89:07 - was definitely something there that
89:09 - helped up but the first step if you do
89:11 - want to work at microsoft or get an
89:12 - internship there just apply online it's
89:15 - the first step for everybody
89:17 - and they have a great program for
89:19 - interns especially university students
89:21 - and even not they're always looking for
89:23 - new people so definitely apply and put
89:25 - your name out there
89:27 - awesome you have quite a varied
89:29 - uh background i have i've had the
89:32 - pleasure of knowing you for many years
89:33 - now
89:34 - through your involvement with the free
89:35 - cocaine community
89:37 - and among the many things you do
89:41 - we all we often joke about free code
89:42 - camp having a bunch of camp counselors
89:45 - that help steward the the non-profit and
89:47 - the open source repo but you are
89:49 - a literal
89:50 - camp counselor
89:52 - yes i am a literal camp counselor i have
89:55 - been for three summers now um
89:59 - and i recommend that everyone takes an
90:01 - opportunity to go enjoy nature and the
90:04 - outdoors
90:06 - more specifically vermont is a beautiful
90:08 - state here in the united states if you
90:10 - ever
90:10 - do get a chance to visit i recommend
90:12 - coming through the state
90:14 - also new hampshire it's got the white
90:15 - mountains or the presidential range
90:17 - beautiful places to hike and canoe
90:20 - and definitely don't take for granted
90:23 - the outdoors getting a set of you know
90:25 - even as much as a programmer i am and
90:27 - the amount of coding i do i always take
90:29 - an opportunity to get outside whether
90:31 - it's a walk or a run in boston or a day
90:33 - hike in the mountains nearby it's
90:36 - definitely a thing and
90:38 - also
90:38 - summer camp
90:40 - send your kids to summer camp go to
90:42 - summer camp
90:43 - maybe a high to become a camp counselor
90:45 - it's one of the best things you can
90:47 - possibly do and you'll learn a lot of
90:49 - things and a lot of things that you can
90:50 - apply to your career your learning
90:53 - experiences your learning process
90:56 - it all comes from camp so yeah
90:59 - awesome well that is quite an
91:00 - endorsement of spending time outdoors
91:03 - and and helping kids kind of get their
91:05 - bearings in nature
91:07 - so thanks for all that you do for the
91:08 - next generation as a camp counselor and
91:11 - also
91:12 - uh
91:13 - thanks again for
91:14 - you know
91:15 - we're going to take some of the some of
91:17 - the terminology from camping we're going
91:19 - to create a bunch of badges for free
91:20 - cocaine we've been meaning to do this
91:21 - from the very beginning
91:23 - you know tinder foot the badge or
91:25 - something like that so i think that
91:27 - there are so many ideas
91:29 - from camping because camping is a fun
91:34 - communal experience like contributing to
91:36 - open source it's not super competitive
91:38 - generally it's just
91:40 - hanging out reflecting
91:42 - and spending time in nature and
91:44 - and i see a lot of similarities between
91:47 - the pace
91:48 - and the general vibe of camping and
91:51 - learning to code very true
91:54 - so
91:55 - on the subject of learning the code
91:59 - you have created a number of videos for
92:02 - the free codecamp youtube channel which
92:04 - have done very well and lots of people
92:05 - have benefited from them and
92:07 - said positive things about them
92:09 - you've also written some articles the
92:11 - medium publication
92:13 - and now you're embarking on the biggest
92:16 - adventure yet
92:17 - in your free code camp contributorship
92:19 - why don't you tell us a little bit about
92:21 - that i can't wait all right so my
92:23 - biggest adventure yet is the python
92:26 - curriculum it has been a
92:28 - little it's been an idea since the
92:30 - beginning but it became more into a
92:32 - fruition about a year ago
92:34 - um we tried it kind of fizzled out but
92:37 - we made some great you know fundamental
92:39 - foundational progress and then this year
92:42 - um due to i i forget who it was but
92:45 - there was some incredible python
92:47 - curriculum that was uploaded on the
92:48 - youtube channel and because of the
92:50 - attention from that we realized the free
92:52 - code community really wants it wants
92:54 - python and wants a in-browser experience
92:58 - just like they currently have for
92:59 - javascript and all the other web deck
93:02 - web tech things
93:03 - so
93:04 - right now i am working on the learn
93:06 - platform of a fork of learn and making
93:09 - it so it can support python in the
93:11 - browser just like you would how how you
93:14 - currently run you know write the code
93:16 - run the test get feedback and all that
93:18 - and earn um
93:20 - earn a certification through a you know
93:22 - step-by-step curriculum
93:23 - so with all that said um i am working
93:26 - hard on getting that foundation set and
93:29 - then once that foundation is set we're
93:30 - going to take a lot of the aspects of
93:32 - what's currently there for the
93:33 - javascript side of things and we're
93:35 - going to try to convert that to python
93:38 - and then once we convert those
93:40 - javascript fundamentals and challenges
93:42 - over to python
93:44 - we will have the first iteration of a
93:46 - python curriculum and then from that
93:48 - there's some very future looking ideas
93:51 - like doing things like more intensive
93:53 - data science um machine learning ai
93:57 - and a lot of the things that you know a
93:59 - lot of people are really interested in
94:00 - but don't even know where to start
94:04 - and
94:06 - what what library are you currently
94:08 - using
94:09 - that looks most promising for running
94:11 - python client-side in the browser
94:14 - so we're currently using python it's a
94:17 - essentially it is an in-browser python
94:20 - editor or at least interpreter um we're
94:22 - going to use the monaco editor to still
94:24 - get the python content for the code from
94:28 - the users and then we're going to pass
94:29 - that through the python which will run
94:31 - the python code that you write along
94:34 - with whatever tests we load in the back
94:36 - end and then uh it'll work very similar
94:39 - to how the current learning platform
94:40 - works with javascript and the way we
94:42 - kind of retrieve the js and run it the
94:44 - same way
94:46 - yeah and python is easy to remember
94:48 - because this browser python brython
94:51 - and you also mentioned monaco
94:54 - monaco for those of you who haven't
94:56 - heard of it yet
94:57 - it is an in-browser editor that is
95:01 - a basically vs code visual studio code
95:04 - but it's running in a browser it's not
95:06 - like the full
95:08 - uh ide but it's it's close it's got a
95:11 - lot of the key functionality like tab
95:13 - completion and things like that
95:15 - at microsoft uh what have you touched
95:18 - any of the tech have you have you made
95:20 - any contributions to any of these big
95:21 - open source projects they have there
95:23 - yeah so i wish i could say yes
95:25 - but i haven't really made direct open
95:28 - source contributions yet but some of the
95:30 - things i have gotten to do include doing
95:33 - a full stack web application we use
95:36 - postgres
95:37 - database we use
95:39 - flask python api for the back end we
95:42 - used react and d3 on the front end
95:45 - i got to learn a lot about svgs and how
95:47 - those work
95:48 - we learned about
95:50 - authentication
95:52 - and then more recently i've been
95:54 - focusing on docker kubernetes and that
95:56 - whole
95:57 - that whole ecosystem and it's it really
96:00 - blows my mind right now what what that
96:02 - all is and um if you're looking to step
96:05 - up your game from i guess more of the
96:07 - basics or that intermediate level and
96:09 - you're like what can i do next i really
96:11 - encourage you to look into docker and
96:12 - kubernetes there's a lot of resources
96:14 - out there and
96:16 - it's really wild what you can do with it
96:18 - and it might seem silly at first and it
96:20 - might seem almost like why would i do
96:22 - all this extra work for something i can
96:24 - already do
96:25 - like natively but once you keep getting
96:28 - into it and learning some of the more
96:30 - verbose things you can do with it it's
96:32 - extremely powerful and it will be the
96:34 - next generation of web tech or just tech
96:38 - in general maybe not necessarily web so
96:41 - and free code camp uses docker for
96:44 - several of our services and we're
96:45 - looking into using kubernetes for some
96:47 - things as well
96:49 - so
96:50 - what are some of your ambitions i mean
96:52 - your hands are pretty full with the
96:53 - python curriculum ana an internship at
96:56 - microsoft and finishing up school how
96:58 - much school do you have left by the way
97:00 - uh one year
97:01 - okay so
97:03 - i guess it's probably hard to think even
97:05 - a year out with so many balls in the air
97:07 - but what are your near-term goals ethan
97:09 - of course
97:10 - so i absolutely love my team at
97:13 - microsoft and i hope some of them get to
97:15 - see this video because i do want them to
97:17 - know just how incredible the team is and
97:20 - i do see a future there
97:22 - i would love i would love a future there
97:24 - but i also have some entrepreneurial
97:26 - ambitions i am i am involved in an
97:29 - entrepreneurial center um at wentworth
97:31 - it's called accelerate
97:33 - we are currently working throughout
97:35 - boston and we're working on some really
97:36 - cool things i hope to share on my
97:38 - twitter if you follow me on twitter
97:40 - you'll see all the updates from that
97:43 - and then
97:45 - on top of that so either by running the
97:48 - program or also coming up with my own
97:50 - entrepreneurial idea
97:52 - i definitely see that in my future
97:55 - but more stable at the moment i think
97:57 - i'm gonna keep doing the open source i
97:59 - really again i really enjoy microsoft
98:01 - and i would love to find a career there
98:04 - um and so yeah i think i think keeping
98:07 - it keeping it simple for my my ambitions
98:09 - at the moment you know i love boston new
98:12 - york city's great too but i do love
98:14 - boston so i'll stick around there for a
98:15 - little more a little while longer
98:17 - so just
98:19 - boston is one of those cities that you
98:20 - just have to visit if you're in the
98:22 - united states there's so much history
98:24 - there
98:25 - if
98:26 - somebody were hypothetical let's say
98:27 - they just had like a 10 hour layover in
98:29 - boston during the day when everything
98:31 - was open
98:32 - what is the one thing you would say they
98:34 - absolutely have to go and do in boston
98:36 - all right this is coming from the coding
98:38 - side of me but there's a coffee chain
98:40 - called pavement coffee you need to go
98:43 - there um they usually have seasonal
98:45 - drinks in fall their seasonal options
98:48 - are the best things ever they have this
98:50 - like fig latte so go into the city find
98:53 - a pavement i believe there's seven or
98:54 - eight of them
98:56 - besides pavement um definitely go to the
98:58 - charles river it is beautiful you can
99:00 - walk on either side of it the cambridge
99:02 - or the boston side um and you get a
99:04 - beautiful skyline either whichever way
99:06 - you look at it and um yeah i think those
99:09 - would be up there are my two favorite
99:10 - things to do or two must do things if
99:13 - you're in boston for 10 hours
99:16 - ethan it's been such a pleasure talking
99:18 - to you man we're very pumped
99:20 - about
99:21 - the python curriculum that you've been
99:22 - working on these past few months we're
99:25 - extremely excited about
99:27 - your awesome videos where you explain
99:29 - concepts like react which are on the
99:31 - youtube channel check them out
99:33 - and
99:34 - i encourage everybody to follow ethan on
99:37 - twitter i'm just gonna pull up his uh
99:40 - twitter here one more time it's
99:42 - arrowwood tech
99:43 - um
99:45 - this guy's going places and uh i want
99:47 - you all to be there to to see his
99:50 - trajectory
99:52 - if anyone does connect with me i love
99:54 - talking and i'll be happy to talk with
99:56 - anybody about anything whether it be
99:58 - tech whether it be about traveling
100:00 - adventuring
100:01 - camping

100:31 - all right
100:33 - and next we have a very special guest
100:36 - coming from carlsbad california
100:41 - she is a
100:43 - long time editor of free cocaine's
100:46 - medium publication
100:47 - tony
100:48 - tony you have probably
100:50 - how many articles do you
100:52 - guess that you may have edited over time
100:54 - maybe 15 000.
100:56 - it seems that way
100:58 - yeah it's a lot it's it's hundreds and
101:00 - hundreds and hundreds of articles that
101:03 - tony has edited i'm going to go ahead
101:04 - and pop her information here up on the
101:07 - screen
101:08 - for everybody to check check her out um
101:12 - tony
101:13 - tell me a little bit about medium and
101:15 - what drew you to the platform
101:18 - well
101:19 - when i first began at free code camp i
101:20 - was
101:21 - advised to
101:23 - get the media in publication
101:25 - and i found that all the articles taught
101:27 - me something
101:28 - and those that didn't it was okay i
101:30 - still learned
101:31 - so when i was given the opportunity to
101:33 - edit for some of my favorite authors i
101:36 - just had to go for it
101:38 - and i'm glad i did because
101:39 - i'm always learning
101:41 - yeah and that that passion for learning
101:45 - that's followed you through life give us
101:46 - a little bit about
101:48 - your background and
101:50 - what made you such a lifelong learner
101:52 - and so curious about all these different
101:54 - topics
101:55 - well i've been wanting some code since i
101:58 - first learned that it existed um i have
102:01 - been
102:02 - self-taught over the years
102:03 - but i didn't have a real curriculum to
102:05 - go with which is why i love free code
102:08 - so i have some good teachers who have
102:10 - helped me more but there were still
102:12 - things i wanted to continue to do
102:15 - i have found that as myself as a
102:17 - teenager i did not believe in myself
102:20 - and so when i was teaching the sat
102:22 - classes
102:24 - i was able to encourage the students to
102:26 - learn
102:27 - and to
102:29 - go to the college of the choice
102:31 - and that reminded me that i should be
102:33 - doing the same thing
102:34 - and so
102:36 - anything that i can do to make the world
102:38 - better the teens better and myself i
102:41 - think it's just great
102:43 - and the fact that pre-code camp and the
102:46 - article i read was helping non-profit
102:48 - organizations was just an added bonus
102:51 - so
102:53 - here i am
102:55 - you're somebody who has
102:57 - lived a lot of places in fact i think
102:58 - you live in two different places you
103:01 - live in both honolulu and carlsbad which
103:03 - if you're not familiar with california
103:05 - geography
103:06 - just north of san diego is that correct
103:10 - yeah so what's it like
103:12 - traveling a lot and bouncing back and
103:14 - forth between those locations you just
103:16 - flew across the us to come to new york
103:17 - city
103:19 - well i don't think i'll do that one
103:20 - again
103:21 - it was a long journey
103:23 - i love honolulu and someday i'm going
103:25 - home
103:26 - carlsbad is good to us
103:28 - and
103:29 - as long as my husband's happy there
103:31 - we'll stay there
103:32 - but
103:33 - we both have our reasons for where we
103:35 - like to live
103:36 - and as far as the travel itself it's not
103:38 - as much fun as it used to be
103:40 - but i still enjoy seeing new places and
103:42 - meeting new people
103:45 - and tell me a little bit about your
103:47 - husband uh is he watching right now i
103:49 - hope so he said he would
103:53 - he's great his um
103:55 - he's an lms administrator
103:57 - corporate trainer
104:00 - and
104:00 - designer for lms systems
104:03 - he also believes in higher education
104:07 - he um
104:08 - we went to honolulu because he wanted to
104:09 - go back to school
104:11 - and i chose ua i chose university of
104:13 - hawaii
104:15 - so he said okay then when he graduated
104:17 - from there he went to
104:19 - honolulu
104:20 - hpu hawaii pacific university got his
104:23 - master's from there and now he's
104:25 - pursuing his um edd
104:27 - so higher education is important to both
104:29 - of us
104:30 - me because i never really went to
104:32 - college and him because he has me loves
104:35 - it
104:36 - so that's
104:38 - my hobby
104:39 - so
104:40 - it sounds like he's he's quite a learned
104:43 - man
104:45 - and
104:46 - it sounds like he also knows quite a bit
104:47 - about technology in general and has that
104:50 - been a big driver for you and continuing
104:52 - your learning about technology actually
104:55 - no i'm the one who's driving him
104:59 - he just learned html
105:01 - he had a spell between about between
105:04 - contracts so he learned css and html
105:07 - meanwhile he'd been watching me by with
105:09 - simon says tic-tac-toe
105:11 - and so he thought this is ridiculous
105:15 - but he was very proud of me every time i
105:16 - did something right
105:18 - so um
105:19 - he needed for the position he wanted to
105:22 - know my sequel so he learned it
105:26 - and then
105:27 - and then i knew and opened up now he's
105:29 - learning javascript
105:31 - so he told me today and he signed up for
105:32 - free code camp as a camper
105:36 - i think i inspired him this time
105:38 - that's great well i'm thrilled that he
105:40 - he's learning and
105:42 - uh you know you're able to kind of guide
105:44 - him
105:45 - to a large extent and help him with his
105:47 - learning as well
105:48 - so have you all uh considered maybe
105:51 - building a project together
105:53 - yes we do have a project we'd like to
105:55 - build and until
105:57 - it all comes together i can't talk about
105:58 - it
105:59 - okay well can you give us even hints
106:01 - about what that project might be about
106:04 - it's about
106:06 - helping others learn
106:08 - and
106:10 - and it's going to be really great and
106:11 - it's
106:13 - it'll hopefully be with aloha
106:16 - so you've
106:18 - you've edited so many of the articles
106:20 - that a lot of the people watching this
106:22 - have have read on the freako camp medium
106:24 - publication
106:25 - we have about 125 000 people who read
106:27 - the medium publication every day now
106:30 - um
106:32 - what is one article that you edited that
106:35 - just you're very proud that you
106:37 - got to be a part of
106:40 - that's difficult because there are a lot
106:41 - of them
106:43 - um
106:44 - i've had people ask me when i when i
106:46 - when i twitter
106:47 - that is that if i've done those and the
106:49 - truth is i have
106:50 - i think that my favorite one
106:53 - my favorite one was by one of my
106:55 - favorite programmers actually and his
106:57 - was how to buy a laptop
106:59 - for beginners because
107:01 - about the time that came out i had just
107:03 - started editing for you and i had
107:06 - already seen his articles before so i
107:08 - jumped on it yes this is my favorite i
107:10 - like this guy
107:11 - and
107:12 - he speaks
107:14 - so clearly
107:16 - to
107:18 - the person who doesn't understand
107:19 - technology
107:21 - and helps them to see this is what you
107:23 - need this is why you need it and it just
107:25 - felt like that was that was something i
107:26 - was a part of and it was in the very
107:28 - beginning which is probably why it stays
107:30 - with me so long
107:31 - [Music]
107:33 - great i think i know what article you're
107:34 - talking about and i'm going to reach out
107:36 - to him and make sure that he knows that
107:38 - you have such warm feelings for his
107:40 - article his guide to buying a laptop
107:43 - i thought that was a profoundly useful
107:45 - guide myself
107:48 - so what would you say your your workflow
107:51 - is like
107:53 - pre-code camp is completely remote we're
107:55 - asynchronous generally
107:56 - we have a trello board where you can go
107:59 - and and the editor team which is pretty
108:01 - small so it's a pretty intimate bunch
108:04 - tony and abby and a few other key people
108:07 - edit
108:08 - virtually every article
108:10 - every article that gets published in
108:12 - preco camp is
108:13 - edited by somebody like tony who
108:18 - cares about
108:19 - quality and style
108:21 - and wants to make sure that the
108:23 - article is in the best possible light
108:26 - what's your workflow like when you sit
108:28 - down to edit like what's your what's
108:31 - your environment like where do you edit
108:33 - just tell us a little bit about like
108:34 - okay i'm gonna go edit now what happens
108:37 - when you make that decision
108:39 - first i have to find an article i like
108:41 - i need to be interested in it
108:43 - that's not really true sometimes abby
108:45 - will say hey someone i need someone to
108:47 - do this immediately and if it looks like
108:49 - i can handle it
108:51 - i like the challenge of english as a
108:53 - second language because my my skill sets
108:56 - and grammar
108:57 - and um so that makes me feel good about
109:00 - it
109:01 - but i really like the ones that just
109:02 - reach out and say hey isn't this
109:04 - something you're interested in you know
109:06 - um you're doing a react thing that you
109:08 - want to read about reaction
109:10 - so i'll decide on the article for
109:12 - whatever reason
109:14 - and of course we have to put our avatar
109:16 - on it to let everybody else know
109:18 - and so once i grab it
109:21 - um
109:22 - i try to finish within 24 hours
109:24 - because i think it's important the
109:25 - author is waiting for this
109:27 - you know but also because if i'm
109:29 - interested enough to call on it i need
109:31 - to
109:32 - to go through it
109:33 - so the main thing i look for is
109:36 - the grammar itself
109:39 - the tenses whether it happened yesterday
109:41 - or will happen in the future
109:43 - basic typos
109:45 - and links links are really important to
109:47 - me
109:48 - so i'll check every link in the article
109:49 - to make sure it goes to where the author
109:51 - says it's going to
109:54 - and i'll also make sure that javascript
109:55 - is spelled with a capital j and a
109:57 - capital s
109:58 - that is one that like javascript would
110:01 - like oh and also github right
110:03 - everybody's followed the git uppercase
110:05 - git huv or no uppercase at all right
110:08 - right that's right it has to be spelled
110:10 - correctly
110:12 - node.js i'm still kind of confused about
110:13 - so
110:15 - yeah i generally do just uppercase nodes
110:18 - dot js
110:20 - and but some people will do node
110:22 - uppercase j upper kss i think angularjs
110:25 - is actually the proper way to do it is
110:27 - angularjs
110:29 - whereas um most of the libraries like
110:31 - react.js you just do a lowercase js at
110:33 - the end
110:35 - that's sort of the rule i follow too
110:38 - so after that i pretty much i hand it
110:40 - over to abby who's our final editor
110:43 - and hopefully she'll say yeah this is
110:44 - great we publish it without fixing too
110:47 - many things
110:48 - yeah do you do you find it helpful to
110:50 - have someone like abby like give you
110:53 - pointers and stuff on your editing
110:55 - um
110:56 - she doesn't actually do that very often
110:58 - anymore
110:59 - i i think that your editor guide that
111:01 - you put out for us
111:03 - i follow that still even i know we're
111:04 - not supposed to it takes too much time
111:07 - but it doesn't take too much time if
111:08 - you're doing it right it's incorporated
111:09 - properly
111:10 - so i follow your editorial guide
111:13 - and abby fortunately thinks the same way
111:15 - i do
111:16 - yeah well if abby's not like pointing
111:19 - out different things that probably means
111:20 - there's nothing to point out
111:22 - so
111:23 - i i would say that that's a testament to
111:24 - you
111:26 - and expanding your skills as an editor
111:28 - and also getting better at taking our
111:30 - style guide and interpreting it and
111:32 - applying it thank you thank you
111:35 - well tony you are so prolific and i just
111:38 - want to drive home to everybody who's
111:40 - watching
111:41 - this is
111:42 - one of the very most prolific editors on
111:45 - the freco camp medium publication
111:47 - the articles that she's edited have
111:50 - probably reached
111:51 - tens of millions of people at this point
111:53 - it's a lot of people who are reading
111:56 - these articles and using them to learn
111:58 - to code so
112:00 - everybody who's watching i strongly
112:02 - encourage you to uh
112:04 - to follow tony on twitter
112:07 - and also just to look out for her she
112:09 - writes some articles of her own tell us
112:11 - a little bit about the most recent
112:13 - article you wrote
112:14 - i'm an outreachy intern
112:16 - and outreachy.org
112:18 - um
112:19 - works with women and
112:21 - underrepresented
112:22 - tech people
112:24 - and places us in internships with a
112:26 - stipend
112:27 - so they pay my way here thank you very
112:28 - much
112:29 - um but as a
112:31 - part of the program i have to blog i
112:33 - have to write an article every two weeks
112:36 - so i've been on my outreachy journey
112:37 - since april
112:39 - and it's about to end unfortunately but
112:41 - but they say that you know come i'll
112:43 - still be able to go forward
112:45 - but what i've been writing lately is all
112:47 - about outreachy and all i'm doing in my
112:49 - internship and
112:50 - how i'm learning and how sometimes i'm
112:53 - not
112:55 - but it's it's i'm very proud of it and
112:59 - i have two um
113:00 - two of my editors actually edit them
113:03 - z and charlie
113:05 - um they'll go back and forth on who's
113:07 - doing it
113:08 - but they give me good feedback
113:11 - and of course abby always says give me
113:12 - more information please
113:14 - so she's teaching me how to write
113:17 - that's great and outreachy is just a
113:20 - wonderful program
113:22 - specifically to get a lot more women
113:23 - into technology and provide them with
113:25 - internships is it through mozilla is
113:27 - that right
113:28 - um i'm not really sure about that i do
113:31 - know they have me at libra health doing
113:33 - the ehr documentation
113:35 - and the reason that i received that
113:37 - internship
113:39 - was because i was an editor on medium
113:41 - and i used everything i knew
113:43 - because this is an editorial
113:45 - right so yeah another instance of people
113:48 - who are contributing to pre-code camp
113:49 - who benefit in all kinds of ways
113:52 - while helping the developer community so
113:56 - you know that's
113:57 - a great byproduct of your contribution
113:59 - that you were able to obtain these
114:01 - fairly competitive uh and
114:04 - very generous
114:05 - uh
114:06 - internship programs
114:09 - i just want to say one thing
114:11 - free code camp is awesome but the
114:13 - authors of the medium digest
114:15 - are the ones who make it work
114:17 - so whether you're talking on a as a
114:19 - beginner level or an advanced level as
114:22 - soon as your articles
114:25 - we'd love to edit them
114:27 - yeah thank you so much tony you
114:30 - helped so many of our writers really
114:31 - shine especially our non-native english
114:33 - speaker writers i frequently hear from
114:35 - people that are so grateful that to have
114:38 - somebody who understands you know
114:40 - grammar really well and is you know has
114:42 - a background in english language and
114:45 - editing and things like that and
114:47 - so it makes a huge difference it helps
114:49 - them put their feet forward people get
114:51 - jobs all the time they get freelance
114:54 - gigs they get internships
114:57 - they get they start companies around
114:59 - things that they've initially written
115:00 - about on the precoc medium publication
115:03 - and a big part of that is because you
115:06 - take the time to really make sure that
115:07 - they are in the best possible life
115:10 - well thank you well they work hard to
115:11 - get there so the least we can do is make
115:13 - them look good

116:18 - from atlanta we are so graced by your
116:21 - presence
116:24 - have learned so much from you
116:26 - over the past year year and a half that
116:28 - you've been contributing at least a year
116:30 - uh i don't remember exactly when we you
116:32 - and i first talked but uh your videos
116:35 - your articles
116:37 - people constantly cite them as being
116:40 - instrumental in their efforts to get
116:42 - jobs and to learn more about programming
116:45 - and just to stay motivated
116:47 - thank you very much i'm excited to be
116:49 - here
116:50 - excited to be part of this amazing group
116:52 - of people
116:54 - you know i'll give you a little bit of
116:56 - background about myself
116:58 - i used to be a lotus notes programmer
117:01 - so when i tell people that i always ask
117:03 - people raise your hand if you've ever
117:05 - used lotus notes ever a lot of people
117:08 - raise their hands and i'm like raise
117:09 - your hand if your company still uses
117:11 - lotus notes nobody does
117:14 - and that explains why i actually got out
117:16 - of programming many many years ago and i
117:19 - started working on an internet marketing
117:21 - business on the side and it grew and i
117:24 - retired at the age of 51
117:26 - and i was retired for about a year and a
117:28 - half
117:29 - and one day i walked into barnes and
117:31 - noble picked up a book on javascript
117:33 - programming on the clearance rack
117:36 - spent a month working through it
117:38 - learning it and then it was like stay
117:40 - unemployed
117:42 - passion for programming and that passion
117:44 - for programming ran won out and i
117:47 - decided to become unemployed i mean
117:50 - unretired and go back into work and i
117:53 - did a coding boot camp that is so
117:54 - prevalent today
117:56 - and after my coding boot camp i
117:58 - graduated
117:59 - got a job working at cnn in atlanta
118:03 - and
118:04 - that's when i started working with free
118:05 - code camp because
118:07 - you know you can only learn so much in
118:10 - three months in a coding bootcamp and i
118:12 - wanted to greatly improve my cutting
118:14 - skills and so i literally in six months
118:18 - when you had the original curriculum
118:20 - went through and did every one of the
118:22 - certificates
118:23 - got to work on one of the
118:26 - non-profit
118:27 - organizations
118:29 - for you know for crimes against women
118:31 - and that was a great experience for
118:33 - doing that and now
118:36 - what i'd like to do is be able to give
118:37 - back and contribute to others
118:41 - well what are some ways that you've been
118:43 - giving back to
118:45 - developers in progress people who are
118:47 - transitioning into the field
118:50 - the number one way that i give back is i
118:53 - write a lot of articles like you had
118:55 - mentioned earlier
118:57 - because i like to write articles from a
118:59 - perspective of
119:00 - i used to be a rookie programmer and i
119:04 - wanted to be able to read something and
119:06 - understand it and be able to apply what
119:09 - i learned from that material there are a
119:11 - lot of articles that are super technical
119:14 - and they were like be above somebody's
119:15 - head or they would explain it but they
119:18 - wouldn't cover everything and so it had
119:20 - those gaps in there and people were like
119:22 - i don't understand this so i like to
119:24 - write from a perspective of
119:26 - how i would have liked to have learned
119:28 - when i was learning and i think that's
119:30 - been very beneficial to people
119:32 - for them to be able to see it and to
119:34 - understand it
119:35 - then the other thing that i've done to
119:37 - give back is
119:40 - so many people are learning how to
119:43 - great for everybody doing that i
119:45 - encourage everybody to do that but then
119:49 - once they learn it and they go out and
119:50 - they start interviewing to get their
119:52 - first job in tech
119:54 - and they're not quite ready for that
119:58 - experience because it's so different
119:59 - from any job you will ever interview for
120:02 - in
120:04 - any career
120:05 - and
120:06 - they feel like you know a deer in
120:08 - headlights when they experience it for
120:10 - the first time so i created a whole
120:13 - series of videos that basically showed
120:16 - people
120:17 - this is what your interview process is
120:19 - going to be like here are actual
120:22 - interview questions that people have
120:23 - asked me
120:25 - others have been asked and then i just
120:27 - sat there on the whiteboard and answered
120:29 - them exactly like what you would see in
120:31 - an interview so that it would benefit
120:34 - them and help out and now
120:36 - after i've done that i go through and
120:39 - helped out being an editor on on the
120:42 - medium publication right now so try to
120:44 - do somewhere between 10 and 14 articles
120:47 - a week that i edit and contribute from
120:49 - that standpoint
120:52 - thank you so much for editing all these
120:53 - articles in addition to writing them i
120:55 - mean when you write the article you're
120:56 - in the spotlight when you're editing an
120:58 - article you're behind the scenes just
121:00 - helping people uh in the background
121:03 - put their best foot forward on with
121:04 - their own work
121:07 - you've spent a lot of time and energy
121:09 - specifically helping people
121:11 - with the somewhat jarring and
121:14 - unpredictable
121:15 - job application process
121:17 - and uh i think one of the things that
121:19 - surprises people the most when they go
121:21 - ahead and apply for jobs it's just that
121:23 - they have to apply for a lot of jobs and
121:26 - it's a pretty it's in the skills you
121:28 - employ in a job interview are very
121:30 - different from what you would employ
121:31 - you're actually doing the job due to the
121:34 - way that the job processes
121:36 - application processes have evolved
121:38 - can you talk a little bit about
121:40 - the things that you think are if you had
121:42 - just a few high-level tips for people
121:44 - when they're applying for jobs
121:47 - absolutely the first
121:50 - tip that i would give people even if you
121:53 - have some of the skill sets they list in
121:56 - a job description but not all of them
121:58 - apply
121:59 - you don't need to have all of them apply
122:02 - every job that i've had since i came out
122:04 - of a cutting boot camp i didn't have a
122:06 - hundred percent of the skill sets but i
122:08 - still got the job
122:10 - number two would be
122:13 - even if you don't think that you have a
122:15 - skill set still apply
122:17 - and then get in get your foot in the
122:19 - door and talk to somebody and if you get
122:22 - a rejection from an interview
122:25 - write them back and do say something
122:28 - like i understand why you rejected me
122:30 - but i think you might want to reconsider
122:33 - because i can do this and if you show
122:36 - that that initiative that drive that
122:39 - motivation
122:40 - a lot of companies will will take a
122:42 - second chance and look at you from that
122:44 - perspective
122:46 - but the other thing is i would encourage
122:49 - people to also go out and start
122:51 - distinguishing themselves from others
122:53 - you know because like my coding boot
122:55 - camp we had you know
122:57 - 20 people in my class 21 people in my
122:59 - class
123:00 - 21 people out interviewing for jobs we
123:03 - all have the exact same skills we went
123:05 - through the same three-month trading
123:06 - camp
123:08 - the people that were writing articles
123:11 - or doing things above and beyond that
123:13 - and they could put that on their resume
123:16 - were the first people to get hired out
123:18 - of that coding boot camp so it's your
123:21 - future it's your career you can take
123:23 - control of it
123:25 - and be able to do something on the side
123:27 - like that where you know
123:29 - the like the live streaming you know i
123:31 - learning how to program i make mistakes
123:34 - do live streaming and people will reach
123:36 - out to you write an article about
123:38 - something people will reach out to you
123:40 - i've i've had people that have come up
123:42 - to me in meetings and i mean at
123:44 - conferences and just say i just want to
123:46 - shake your hand i follow you on on
123:48 - twitter i read your stuff and i'm like i
123:51 - don't know who these people are but they
123:52 - know who i am because of what i've done
123:55 - so that those are the the
123:56 - recommendations that i would give to
123:58 - people
124:00 - that's some great advice
124:03 - jennifer
124:04 - about 15 percent of the people in the
124:07 - freco camp community they use free code
124:09 - camp's learning platform and are are
124:11 - transitioning into developer jobs
124:14 - are
124:15 - 45 and older you're someone who in her
124:18 - 50s
124:20 - learned an entirely new additional skill
124:22 - set
124:23 - granted you already knew lotus notes
124:25 - programming and things like that but i
124:26 - imagine you had to learn a lot of new
124:28 - stuff too
124:30 - what would be some advice for people who
124:33 - are in their 40s 50s 60s who are
124:36 - planning to transition
124:38 - who may feel discouraged by the
124:40 - you know the
124:42 - perception in many cases that it's
124:44 - harder for people to get into tech if if
124:47 - they're doing it as a second or third
124:49 - career
124:50 - um that's that's a very good question
124:53 - because i did attend the coding boot
124:54 - camp when i was 51 i actually turned 52
124:59 - in the middle of that three month
125:01 - coding boot camp
125:02 - i would encourage everybody to do it
125:04 - you're never too old to start to learn
125:08 - to get into tech
125:10 - and a lot of people that are older or
125:12 - discouraged because they're like
125:14 - i'm too old you know i don't know this
125:16 - and i'm but here's my take on that
125:20 - for somebody that's older
125:22 - you've got decades of life experiences
125:26 - business experiences that people in
125:28 - their 20s or 30s aren't going to have
125:31 - for
125:32 - 20 or 30 years from now and even if you
125:34 - are learning to program you're going to
125:36 - have business experience that you can
125:39 - apply to any project that you're working
125:41 - on in a company and that
125:44 - is invaluable to any company to have
125:47 - because if you're thinking about coming
125:49 - out with the new product or a new app or
125:52 - something like that
125:53 - you're going to be able to provide input
125:56 - and direction because of that experience
125:58 - that nobody else has and that because of
126:01 - that you're going to end up producing a
126:03 - better product a better quality app you
126:06 - know something like that
126:08 - and it's just become better because of
126:10 - that experience that you're going to be
126:12 - able to offer up to potential employers
126:17 - what are some first steps you would say
126:20 - if somebody's on the fence about whether
126:22 - they should
126:23 - take the jump and pursue coding let's
126:26 - say hypothetically they are somebody
126:28 - who's worked in a completely unrelated
126:30 - field like doing accounting
126:32 - or business management or they've been
126:35 - somewhat technical like doing some i.t
126:37 - related stuff but they want to get more
126:39 - technical what would be the first few
126:41 - things that you would recommend they
126:43 - look into doing
126:45 - the first thing i would recommend them
126:47 - doing is to learn the basics of html and
126:50 - css
126:52 - go out and take
126:54 - a website that you like out there and
126:57 - see if you can reproduce it
126:59 - in in html and css yourself
127:03 - that will tell you
127:05 - pretty much upfront whether or not you
127:07 - like
127:08 - programming
127:10 - and it's because some people decide they
127:12 - want to go into tech and then once they
127:14 - get into it they're like i hate it and
127:16 - that's fine that's not it's not for
127:18 - everybody but that's always a good way
127:21 - to start to learn
127:23 - um on there um and but then also realize
127:26 - that that programming isn't the only job
127:28 - that somebody can have to get into tech
127:31 - you can be a project manager you can be
127:33 - a project owner you can be a quality
127:36 - analyst you could be a front-end
127:39 - developer you could be a back-end
127:40 - developer you could do machine language
127:43 - ai
127:44 - you could be a scrum master
127:46 - there are a wide range of skills that
127:49 - are out there but i would recommend that
127:51 - everybody start off with something basic
127:53 - like html and css which is just
127:56 - solidified that you enjoy this
127:58 - experience before you go jump into it
128:01 - you know
128:02 - from the deep end
128:04 - because then if you don't like it you've
128:06 - saved yourself from that and if you do
128:07 - like it then you're motivated to
128:09 - basically keep learning from that point
128:14 - thank you jennifer and
128:17 - i'm curious
128:18 - you've made this transition over the
128:21 - past few years you've created an
128:22 - incredible corpus of
128:24 - uh
128:25 - job applications like interviewing prep
128:28 - material video articles
128:31 - what are some of your ambitions for the
128:33 - next year or so
128:37 - a friend and i are going to be starting
128:39 - a podcast
128:40 - we're going to be talking about getting
128:42 - more women into tech which i think is a
128:45 - very valuable thing that we need to do
128:48 - and we're also going to be creating a
128:49 - whole series of videos that we talk
128:51 - about
128:52 - the different roles in tech how to get
128:54 - into tech how to finance your
128:57 - career going into tech and stuff like
128:59 - that
129:00 - but
129:01 - that's the one thing that i'm going to
129:02 - be working on but the other thing that
129:05 - was i mentioned earlier in my
129:07 - introduction is
129:09 - go out and tell people about how to get
129:10 - into open source software how to
129:12 - contribute to open source software
129:14 - people think oh it's going to be too
129:16 - technical it's going to be too much and
129:18 - with what i'm doing right now with you
129:20 - know the node.js with their mentorship
129:22 - program
129:23 - i can be able to create videos and show
129:26 - what i've done
129:27 - and be able to look people can look at
129:29 - that and say oh i could possibly do that
129:33 - too
129:34 - and i can show them how they can get
129:36 - involved with that
129:37 - because if you have something like that
129:39 - you've contributed to open source on
129:41 - your
129:42 - resume
129:43 - when you're getting your first job it's
129:46 - one of those things that makes you stand
129:48 - out from the crowd and will make you
129:51 - get
129:52 - to get a job a lot quicker
129:54 - but i want to keep contributing and
129:56 - giving back to the community
129:59 - and i'm excited you know for what's
130:02 - coming up
130:04 - jennifer i can tell you that you're
130:06 - going to have at least one listener for
130:07 - your podcast day one
130:09 - i am very excited to to hear it and i
130:13 - i frequently encourage everybody to
130:15 - start a podcast because it's one of
130:17 - those things where people have so much
130:19 - time they're driving they're going for a
130:21 - walk that they can fill with these
130:22 - wonderful podcasts and we need more
130:25 - podcasts on women in tech especially
130:27 - there are a few really good ones that i
130:28 - listen to but it's it's just a an
130:31 - underexplored
130:33 - uh under publicized
130:36 - issue an area where we can make a big
130:38 - difference so i'm very excited about
130:40 - your upcoming podcast especially thank
130:43 - you very much i appreciate it all right
130:45 - thank you so much jennifer i'm going to
130:47 - bring up your information again

131:20 - definitely should meet
131:22 - okay i'll see you in a little bit
131:30 - all right
131:31 - in the egg chair
131:32 - we have none other than the legendary
131:36 - absolutely legendary
131:40 - stuart
131:41 - taylor i'm sorry i'm having a technical
131:43 - difficulty here
131:52 - could you plug in that url again
131:54 - i'm using i'm using firefox uh
131:58 - what is it called it's like a firefox
132:00 - browser that's like completely privacy
132:02 - focused so it doesn't have any history
132:04 - or anything like that and it doesn't
132:06 - allow any ads or any trackers or
132:08 - anything it's really cool but i
132:10 - accidentally hit back and because
132:11 - there's no history i couldn't get back
132:13 - to the web app that matt built oh
132:16 - perfect
132:17 - no this is great
132:18 - you look great man
132:21 - thank you
132:22 - thank you so much for flying out from
132:25 - bali castle which is a town
132:28 - in ireland right by
132:30 - belfast
132:32 - reasonably close to belfast right
132:35 - so
132:36 - um oh it refreshed so i can find you
132:38 - alphabetically
132:43 - uh
132:44 - i got it i got it
132:46 - so stuart and i go way back
132:49 - uh he has been a prolific
132:52 - contributor
132:53 - to free code camp
132:55 - [Music]
133:00 - uh my change didn't stick
133:03 - so i guess we discovered a bug in this
133:05 - app whenever you manually enter a name
133:07 - if you refresh the app the uh the name
133:10 - system seems to disappear
133:12 - did you not see it it should be at the
133:13 - bottom
133:14 - it's not at
133:17 - i inputted it initially yeah just
133:19 - reinput everything real quick and then
133:21 - we'll pop it up on the we're doing some
133:23 - live uh debugging here
133:26 - it's a really cool
133:27 - web app it's really intuitive um
133:30 - i think that like having a search field
133:32 - where i can just type a name and it
133:33 - autocompletes would be helpful so i'm
133:35 - not having to scroll through 250 names
133:37 - of top contributors
133:39 - but
133:40 - yeah overall my hat's off to you matt
133:44 - for uh for making this amazing app
133:47 - and thanks also for
133:49 - grabbing people and bringing them over
133:50 - here so i could talk to him
133:53 - yeah he's doing he's doing the piece
133:55 - and the thumbs up terminator 2 style
134:00 - right now okay
134:03 - mr stuart taylor
134:06 - coming to us from bally castle
134:09 - uh
134:10 - stuart doesn't need an introduction but
134:13 - i'm going to give him one just in case
134:15 - you haven't heard of this miraculous
134:16 - human being
134:18 - stuart
134:20 - was
134:21 - you know
134:24 - man i okay
134:26 - i'm gonna lean in and put my arm around
134:28 - him
134:29 - yeah come on you got this
134:32 - so
134:32 - stewart
134:34 - has been a prolific contributor to free
134:37 - coke camp if you use the preco camp
134:39 - curriculum in the past two months it's
134:42 - running
134:42 - on the learn
134:44 - application that stewart led the
134:47 - creation of
134:48 - stuart has re-architected free code
134:51 - camp's
134:52 - learning platform completely to be a
134:54 - static application
134:56 - uh and to interact with an api
134:59 - and it's extremely fast it's all react
135:02 - it's a single page app it'll lazy load
135:04 - challenges if they haven't already been
135:06 - loaded when you're using it but as a
135:08 - result it's faster than ever it's
135:10 - smoother than ever
135:11 - stuart also created the free code camp
135:14 - guide
135:15 - which is
135:16 - an incredibly important part of free
135:19 - code camp
135:20 - it's a layperson accessible version of
135:23 - like the mozilla developer network would
135:25 - be a good way to describe it and we have
135:27 - 4 000 plus articles there
135:29 - on all range of topics you know c plus
135:33 - plus
135:34 - sql of course javascript and and little
135:38 - articles on pretty much every single
135:40 - challenge on the pre-cocaine curriculum
135:42 - many of which are stubs and we welcome
135:44 - your help flushing those stubs out so
135:46 - that people can have like
135:48 - kind of a corresponding hint with
135:50 - spoilers and things like that in case
135:52 - they get stuck on a challenge
135:53 - but
135:55 - stuart has been building
135:57 - all these things he's been doing so much
135:59 - exciting stuff to to help us like
136:02 - simplify the devops flow
136:04 - improve site reliability
136:07 - you name it
136:08 - that's
136:09 - stewart and his recent contributions to
136:12 - free code camp stuart now works
136:13 - full-time for free co camp he is
136:16 - the senior most developer on our team
136:19 - at this point
136:21 - he touches pretty much every aspect of
136:23 - free code camp he even has production
136:26 - access to the database in case he wants
136:28 - to pull a git lab and wipe out a day's
136:30 - worth of data i'm just i'm just kidding
136:33 - if you have an or forget laughter we
136:35 - love your postmortem on that get lab
136:36 - friends
136:37 - so
136:39 - um i've been talking a lot about stuart
136:41 - i'm gonna let stewart tell you a little
136:42 - bit about his background and how he came
136:45 - to be a developer
136:47 - all right hi how you doing
136:49 - so uh
136:50 - i'd say my working life started out i
136:52 - was uh i was in the military
136:55 - isn't it for
136:56 - eight years
136:58 - uh once that finished i uh
137:01 - i started work for a telecoms company
137:04 - building fiber optic network so i i
137:06 - built the internet around where i live
137:08 - it's only a small country of 1.8 million
137:11 - people
137:13 - got everyone past the internet and uh
137:15 - i wound up being a stay-at-home dad
137:19 - and in that time i thought
137:21 - well my wife she had a business and she
137:23 - needed a website
137:25 - so we went to squarespace
137:28 - and uh just used their website builder
137:31 - built our website fantastic worked great
137:34 - until we
137:35 - decided to change
137:37 - the header image on the the front page
137:39 - now originally there was a picture of a
137:41 - woman
137:42 - my wife doesn't it's an aesthetics
137:44 - business
137:46 - so
137:46 - the original image was a woman on the
137:48 - left-hand side and we had the the
137:50 - business name and a call to action but
137:52 - on the right-hand side but we got some
137:53 - new images and the image we wanted on
137:56 - the header was
137:58 - the one was on the right hand side
138:00 - we didn't want the title and the call to
138:02 - action button over her face we wanted to
138:04 - move across the other side
138:06 - so i rang squarespace said hey look how
138:08 - can i get the site title and this little
138:11 - button over to the other side of the
138:12 - page
138:13 - and the
138:15 - person on the phone said look
138:17 - you can't do it
138:19 - it's not possible
138:22 - so i thought um that doesn't sound quite
138:25 - right
138:26 - so i went on the internet i googled
138:28 - around and i thought well
138:29 - how can i
138:30 - move a button to the other side of a
138:32 - page on a website
138:33 - and found a little stack overload thing
138:35 - and typed in some css didn't know what
138:38 - that was
138:39 - typed it in and it worked all right well
138:41 - that was pretty cool
138:42 - i wonder what else i can do can i get
138:44 - this so if you scroll down the page
138:46 - there's another image that comes in as
138:47 - well can i get that to slide in you know
138:50 - like all the other cool websites out
138:51 - there
138:53 - no clue how to do it
138:54 - how do i make an image slide in from the
138:57 - side of the page in a website
138:58 - stack overflow something about jquery
139:01 - copy and paste this code all right it
139:03 - worked brilliant
139:04 - wonder what else i can do so i i went uh
139:07 - searching around and found some courses
139:09 - on uh
139:10 - like coke academy and all that and
139:13 - worked through a few of them didn't
139:14 - quite like too much of it
139:16 - somehow found free co-camp
139:19 - i started working through their
139:20 - curriculum i thought yeah this works for
139:22 - me and
139:22 - this is really easy it was html stuff
139:24 - i've seen this before i'll bash that out
139:26 - brilliant right javascript does that
139:28 - like jquery i don't know but carry on
139:31 - going and
139:32 - so it got to the point where i was
139:34 - comfortable with what i was doing and i
139:36 - thought well this is this
139:37 - this
139:38 - free code camp they give back to the
139:40 - community as a whole i was wondering how
139:42 - can i make how can i
139:44 - how can i help them
139:46 - that's where i found github and
139:49 - when looking through all the issues and
139:52 - i found an issue where
139:55 - there was a diagram of it was describing
139:57 - some sort of class name on a bootstrap
139:59 - button and there was a typo on the image
140:03 - and the issue was to change the image
140:05 - so though it wouldn't be better if it
140:06 - was just code if you just have a button
140:09 - on the screen and have
140:11 - the snippet of what that code is for the
140:13 - button
140:14 - and i managed to get that implemented
140:15 - and after a bit of tune from we got a
140:17 - pull request opened and i got it merged
140:20 - and it was the greatest feeling in the
140:21 - world
140:22 - like somebody sort of
140:25 - verified my ability to code something
140:28 - you know so like somebody had said like
140:31 - yeah this is good enough for free code
140:33 - camp and it was accepted it was pushed
140:36 - live and it was just amazing it was all
140:38 - right well what else can i do
140:40 - and that sort of pattern went on from
140:43 - what else can i do how do i do that
140:45 - right that's how i've managed to do it
140:47 - all right somebody said it's good enough
140:49 - so what else can i do that sort of
140:52 - snowballed effectively to where i was
140:54 - implementing features in react
140:57 - i mean six months before that was
140:59 - happening i didn't know what react was
141:01 - i was getting features implemented and i
141:04 - was fixing bugs and it turns out then
141:06 - that
141:07 - somebody wanted to hire me to do
141:09 - something i was doing for a hobby and of
141:11 - course i said yeah all right
141:13 - and then
141:14 - here i am today
141:16 - knocking code out all over the place
141:20 - extending the reach for free co-camp
141:22 - making it easier for people to get there
141:23 - and
141:24 - start learning the way i did
141:29 - so stuart
141:31 - you have learned so much just in the
141:34 - past two two and a half years since you
141:36 - really dug in since that squarespace
141:38 - incident that was that was uh day one
141:41 - for you really with this new career and
141:44 - now
141:45 - you know uh we talked to developers all
141:47 - the time we were talking to some some
141:49 - people working as full-time devs
141:51 - last night at a major company and uh
141:55 - you were basically schooling them on the
141:58 - the trade-offs of implementing graphql
142:02 - and and why graphql was in many cases
142:05 - superior to just a like hacking together
142:09 - a rest api that has similar
142:11 - functionality so
142:13 - what has that journey been like on an
142:15 - emotional level going from
142:17 - being a fiber optic engineer from being
142:20 - a veteran
142:21 - in the uh the british air force with
142:24 - with tours in both afghanistan and iraq
142:26 - i'll add
142:28 - to that that transition
142:30 - into
142:31 - being on the edge of the newest web
142:34 - development technology and implementing
142:36 - it and implementing it at scale
142:38 - where millions of people are using it
142:39 - each month what has that process felt
142:41 - like for you
142:45 - it's been
142:46 - emotional and tiring
142:48 - but overall it's been rewarding
142:51 - even just noticing how
142:54 - i've progressed in tackling issues and
142:58 - thinking through
142:59 - what needs to be done what the
143:02 - the aim of what it is i'm doing
143:04 - and how
143:05 - my road map to get to that goal
143:09 - before it was just
143:12 - well sorry a lot of it was just
143:14 - googling how to do how to do make the
143:18 - thing do the thing
143:20 - i still do that now
143:22 - but
143:23 - i don't know it's
143:24 - [Music]
143:27 - the
143:29 - sort of humbling is the reach you can
143:30 - have
143:31 - just for
143:32 - [Music]
143:33 - fixing the smallest little thing i mean
143:35 - it could be the simplest like little
143:38 - a tweak with some styles maybe or a
143:41 - little tweak with some html
143:44 - it's
143:44 - maybe tiny for you and
143:47 - it's trivial to implement
143:50 - but
143:51 - the effect it has like you say on
143:53 - millions of people like so
143:55 - there may be some maybe it's an
143:56 - accessibility issue
143:58 - i mean myself has been an able-bodied
144:02 - person or an able-minded abled vision
144:05 - i wouldn't see the issue there but
144:07 - somebody's flagged it up and said look
144:09 - if you did this it would make it easier
144:10 - for us to understand the concept or to
144:13 - interact with the platform
144:15 - doing something as trivial as just
144:17 - tweaking some html css and having
144:20 - an impact on potentially millions of
144:22 - people
144:23 - it's humbling
144:25 - and
144:28 - you get
144:28 - it's
144:29 - almost wholesome
144:31 - knowing that everything that every
144:33 - feature you implement or
144:35 - bug you fix
144:36 - it's helping other people
144:39 - learn to do what you are doing
144:41 - which is the end of this that's the goal
144:43 - of free co-cambers to get people
144:46 - programming
144:47 - so yeah it's
144:50 - it's i do it again
144:53 - right on third well thanks for sharing
144:55 - your thoughts on that the emotional
144:57 - journey where you are today
145:00 - we are extremely grateful to have you on
145:02 - our team
145:03 - uh i'm learning so much from you we're
145:05 - getting so much done things are moving
145:07 - so quickly free code game now a big
145:10 - big part of it is having you
145:12 - uh
145:13 - leading a lot of these new services and
145:15 - and rolling things out and helping us
145:18 - rapidly re-architect things so stewart
145:20 - um i'm gonna go ahead and pop up
145:22 - stewart's twitter information
145:26 - i strongly recommend following him i
145:28 - think he's a
145:29 - very interesting
145:30 - guy who tweets some interesting stuff
145:32 - and
145:33 - just keep an eye out for new projects in
145:36 - the pipeline coming from stuart because
145:38 - they are
145:40 - very exciting
145:42 - anything else any last words for uh the
145:46 - audience
145:47 - just keep on hacking
145:49 - well well put thanks stuart
146:17 - so
146:18 - we're going to do some pretty quick ones
146:19 - i'd like to talk to you guys
146:23 - okay
146:27 - okay cool see you today
146:29 - hey have a seat bill you get to sit in
146:31 - the egg chair
146:32 - the men in black chair i don't know
146:34 - anything about this thing
146:37 - i just didn't want to do the whole butt
146:38 - in front of the camera thing yeah good
146:41 - good call
146:44 - so
146:46 - bill doesn't need much of an
146:47 - introduction if you've read the precoc
146:49 - medium publication you've almost
146:50 - certainly seen him
146:52 - on there he is prolific
146:54 - he's done quite a few podcast episodes
146:58 - uh as well
146:59 - and he's just an extremely experienced
147:02 - knowledgeable developer been
147:04 - coding for more than 20 years
147:06 - done
147:07 - high profile projects for lots of
147:09 - different corporations and government
147:11 - agencies around canada
147:13 - bill welcome
147:15 - thank you so much and no pressure that's
147:17 - a heck of an introduction
147:18 - thanks quincy
147:20 - phil you're somebody whom i look up to
147:22 - as a mentor i've learned so many
147:24 - software engineering best practices from
147:26 - you
147:27 - what are some areas of software
147:29 - engineering that you would say are the
147:31 - most interesting for you that you really
147:33 - want to drill down and continue to
147:35 - specialize in as your career progresses
147:38 - so one of the things that i come across
147:41 - a lot
147:42 - is
147:43 - the notion so just to for background for
147:45 - the sake of background and sorry i'm
147:47 - going to talk for a little second now
147:49 - i never have a problem talking so um
147:51 - what i do is i'm a freelance consultant
147:54 - and so oftentimes i
147:56 - airdrop into an organization when most
147:59 - of their apps are like seven to ten to
148:01 - more years old and they've got um
148:04 - so much technical debt that the the
148:07 - engineering team the dev team is
148:09 - spending most of their time you know
148:11 - dealing with that technical debt like 80
148:13 - 90 percent of the resources are being
148:15 - spent on that and the business side of
148:16 - the house or the clients in in there are
148:19 - really frustrated because they can't get
148:21 - much value out of this dev team so
148:22 - they're paying all this money for all
148:24 - these engineers and they're not really
148:25 - getting much out of it because the
148:26 - engineers are really busy you know
148:28 - living with
148:30 - the hell that they've created for
148:31 - themselves right
148:33 - and there are some really common things
148:36 - that i see from client to client to
148:37 - client that contribute to that around
148:40 - how
148:41 - how those apps were were built in the
148:43 - first place and and how they were you
148:46 - know basically it's a problem of
148:47 - architecture and so that's an area that
148:50 - i'm you know as i get more and more
148:53 - experienced i i think that's a really
148:54 - key vital thing and i don't think that
148:56 - you know
148:57 - i don't know that that that's the first
148:58 - thing you're going to learn as a pro if
149:00 - you're coming to free code camp and you
149:01 - know you haven't written a lick of
149:02 - javascript that's probably not the first
149:03 - thing you should focus on but um
149:06 - as as people come into organizations and
149:09 - and they're you know uh getting their
149:11 - first first job or they're in their
149:13 - their first year
149:14 - these are the kinds of things that um
149:16 - i want to figure out how to help people
149:20 - learn and understand and so
149:23 - it really comes down to like how
149:25 - how you architect your application and
149:28 - and the common one of the most common
149:31 - things is the the tight coupling of
149:35 - business logic integration logic and
149:38 - third-party dependencies
149:40 - so you've got
149:41 - some framework that's like you know some
149:43 - framework or library that's like the the
149:45 - hot thing of the of the moment and then
149:48 - you've got some uh
149:51 - integration of your dependencies and
149:52 - you've got all your business logic and
149:54 - it's one kind of ball of mud that's all
149:56 - really
149:57 - tightly coupled together so i see that
150:00 - over and over and over and over and over
150:02 - again and then what happens is
150:04 - you know fast forward several years that
150:07 - whatever framework or library it was is
150:09 - like no longer the hotness and in fact
150:11 - it's virtually abandoned and full of
150:14 - security holes the business logic that
150:16 - you have in there is not well documented
150:18 - no one understands it no one knows what
150:20 - to do with it and nobody wants to touch
150:21 - the thing because they're like well if
150:23 - we touch this we break like the universe
150:25 - and so we don't know what to do and so
150:27 - so trying to teach people how to tackle
150:29 - and solve those problems is what i'm
150:31 - becoming more and more interested in and
150:33 - i have i think a few ways into it but i
150:35 - still haven't like
150:37 - fully wrapped my mind around it sorry
150:38 - that's like a super long detailed answer
150:40 - to like that question yeah and you have
150:42 - a newsletter dev mastery that often
150:45 - delves into a lot of these
150:48 - more advanced i would say considerations
150:51 - in
150:52 - architecture decisions and and how to
150:55 - prevent the kind of toxic technical debt
150:58 - as opposed to the more manageable
150:59 - technical debt right yeah i mean you're
151:01 - never going to be like
151:02 - debt free or technical debt free but if
151:04 - you
151:05 - you know if you think about an
151:06 - organization like if you kind of zoom
151:08 - out and think about like okay they're
151:10 - pouring money they're investing money
151:12 - into like their dev team and less and
151:15 - less of that money is going to like
151:17 - generating new value because it's all
151:19 - being spent on like dealing with the
151:20 - craft of the past that that's a bad
151:23 - scenario right um so yeah so this
151:25 - newsletter um that you can get from
151:27 - devmastery.com that i send out um as
151:30 - often as i can when i have time and
151:32 - these are some of the types of things
151:34 - that i like to tackle so that and then
151:36 - you know just articles that i find
151:38 - interesting topics that i find
151:39 - interesting that i think would be would
151:41 - be helpful to others at um pretty much
151:43 - at all levels i think um
151:46 - but you really people in the first
151:48 - the feedback that i get is people in the
151:50 - first sort of five years of their career
151:52 - from like zero to five years
151:54 - tends to be sort of the sweet spot for
151:56 - the stuff that i put out um
151:59 - you know again if it's like if you
152:00 - written your first line of code
152:02 - yesterday
152:03 - it might not be for you yet but soon
152:06 - it'll be for you soon and then uh you
152:08 - know if you just got your first job for
152:09 - sure
152:10 - i'm gonna hit you with stuff that you
152:12 - you need to start thinking about um and
152:14 - so yeah so that's been pretty cool
152:17 - awesome uh so
152:19 - you've done so much for the free cocaine
152:21 - community and for the developer
152:22 - community at large by
152:25 - singing your best practices and
152:27 - we're very excited about
152:29 - you continuing to
152:31 - create more tools and resources for
152:34 - people to
152:35 - learn to code and especially learn
152:36 - advanced computer science and advanced
152:38 - uh
152:39 - you know application
152:41 - design
152:42 - what are what are some of the things
152:44 - that you're interested in covering in
152:46 - the near future
152:47 - so test driven development is is an area
152:50 - that i'd really like to get into and
152:51 - specifically test driven development
152:53 - with javascript because i think there's
152:55 - lots of content for tdd for a lot of
152:58 - other languages but i haven't seen
153:00 - anything yet that really
153:02 - nails it for javascript and that's
153:05 - complete enough so i i'd like to i'd
153:08 - like to write more about that
153:10 - and definitely like through the through
153:12 - free code
153:13 - through free code camp as a as a medium
153:15 - for that or as a channel for that um i
153:17 - think it would be a great avenue and so
153:20 - that's uh that's probably what's next on
153:22 - the horizon
153:23 - uh if we i'm kind of asking you on the
153:25 - spot but uh would you be open to me

156:32 - for coming out tonight uh so raphael has
156:35 - been a major contributor to the freco
156:38 - camp wiki which was the precursor to the
156:40 - free co camp guide if you go to
156:41 - guide.freecodecamp.org
156:43 - there's a good chance that some of the
156:44 - articles you'll read there were authored
156:46 - by none other than rafael originally
156:49 - raphael tell us a little bit about
156:50 - yourself
156:52 - well
156:54 - i'm really from the dominican republic i
156:57 - came here 2005
157:00 - looking for
157:01 - software engineer career but my
157:04 - translations were in that use so i went
157:05 - for computer science which was the
157:07 - closest
157:09 - and from there
157:11 - i finished school i started applying for
157:13 - jobs
157:15 - you know
157:17 - a lot of emails interviews and nothing
157:20 - happening so
157:21 - i decide
157:24 - i will go and
157:26 - study something else
157:28 - and i started doing let me
157:31 - checked python or some programming
157:33 - language
157:34 - there were a lot of jobs
157:36 - looking for those skills
157:38 - and checking different languages i ended
157:40 - up with javascript
157:42 - and i said this is my language
157:45 - i can use on the front end a case on the
157:47 - back end
157:48 - seems like if i learn this
157:50 - i'll be good anywhere i go
157:54 - so i started studying that i discovered
157:56 - free codecamp i say
157:59 - bootcamp seems to be what everybody's
158:00 - doing to
158:02 - learn fast get a job and this is what i
158:05 - named my new at the time
158:07 - uh my son was
158:10 - very young like
158:12 - three
158:14 - so
158:15 - i still live in my family
158:17 - i have a kid i finish school i'm trying
158:20 - to
158:20 - get a job soon and
158:22 - freako cam
158:24 - what's the place i said i'm gonna do
158:26 - this this looks promising i'm gonna do
158:28 - it
158:29 - and i start working on the challenges
158:33 - and because i have bad memory i don't
158:36 - trust my own memory i decided let me
158:38 - take notes but let me take good notes
158:40 - not like i did back in high school
158:43 - right so you essentially took your notes
158:46 - on all the challenges and that formed
158:48 - the basis of the wiki
158:50 - and i remember approaching you
158:53 - two years ago two and a half years ago
158:55 - and you had these elaborate notes with
158:57 - your solutions and everything on all
159:00 - these free code camp channel challenges
159:02 - and we used that as the basis for the
159:03 - wiki
159:04 - so what have you been up to
159:06 - i guess last time we hung out was april
159:09 - 2017 we hung out um
159:12 - what have you been up to since then
159:15 - i'm mostly working i started my
159:18 - a job um may 1st
159:21 - so congratulations
159:23 - thank you actually watch me last year so
159:25 - now i've been there for over a year and
159:28 - i've been focusing on that
159:31 - it is not web development per se
159:34 - but i decided to take a chance and not
159:36 - just focus this is what i study i only
159:38 - want to work on this
159:40 - so i went more into
159:43 - business size and working with ai
159:46 - but i feel like
159:48 - javascript full stack and i'm planning
159:50 - on
159:51 - consuming the new curriculum i actually
159:53 - saw region 3 and say oh
159:55 - this is great i should do this
159:57 - well if you do it we would very much
159:59 - welcome your detailed notes a lot of
160:01 - those challenges don't yet have we we
160:03 - added more than a thousand new
160:04 - challenges to the curriculum and a lot
160:06 - of them don't have detailed notes yet
160:09 - yeah so in there are a lot of things i
160:12 - check i have
160:13 - the
160:14 - legacy front-end certificate
160:17 - i never finished the back end because i
160:19 - wanted to master rihanna at least get to
160:22 - a good level before i finish the full on
160:24 - the full stack
160:25 - so i'm definitely looking forward to the
160:27 - react articles now
160:29 - have you had a chance to get your son
160:31 - he's like five or six now how old is he
160:33 - uh right now he's eight
160:35 - oh he's eight okay so
160:36 - uh has he done any coding yet are you
160:39 - thinking about getting him in front of a
160:40 - computer a little bit
160:42 - actually he has he asked me to teach him
160:45 - how to code
160:46 - he's a little familiar with ricochet
160:48 - because he will always see me in freako
160:50 - camp
160:51 - and i tried teaching him
160:54 - and it turns out he was more interested
160:56 - about the hour code and
160:58 - basically the video games that they had
160:59 - to get them interested
161:01 - yeah those games are great for kids and
161:03 - so is he doing scratch
161:06 - yeah he was doing scratch
161:09 - and i tried to have him stick to it and
161:12 - he wanted to go more towards just a full
161:14 - game where he would use play so you know
161:17 - it takes a little bit at least the
161:19 - interest is there right well free code
161:20 - camp is designed for adults primarily
161:23 - and not kids so that's not terribly
161:24 - surprising but i'm impressed that he's
161:26 - coding already at age eight i think
161:27 - that's great
161:30 - yeah i mean right now he's more into art
161:33 - but the interest is there so i'm
161:35 - planning on nurturing it whether he's
161:37 - planning going for actual development or
161:39 - just getting some code skills so he can
161:42 - eventually have his own website for his
161:44 - comics which he likes to do
161:47 - well rafael thank you so much for your
161:48 - many contributions to the pre-co camp
161:50 - community
161:51 - i see you're wearing a freako camp shirt
161:54 - this is the halloween shirt from last
161:56 - year with the css ghost shirt
161:59 - here
162:02 - yeah
162:04 - you're the ghost hey man it's been real
162:07 - uh stick around i'm excited to catch up
162:09 - and hear how things are going thank you
162:11 - very much
162:13 - thanks again raphael
162:18 - he was very gracious
162:22 - joe come on over here man
162:34 - it takes a little getting used to
162:35 - doesn't it you're getting to see why you
162:36 - chose this chair it establishes like
162:38 - dominance well
162:40 - i i couldn't find a chair that was a
162:42 - little lower i mean this is a this is a
162:44 - cool visual chair
162:48 - all right i'm pulling you up on here
162:52 - joe uh
162:55 - vintage joe hill
162:57 - on twitter check out joe so uh joe
163:01 - hails from norfolk virginia where he
163:04 - has been leading the prequel camp study
163:06 - group
163:08 - tell us a little bit about that
163:10 - well um i think it was 2015 when you
163:13 - originally made the call
163:14 - when i first found free code camp it was
163:16 - probably in
163:18 - i think you put out the call in like
163:19 - october or november of 2015. i
163:22 - was
163:24 - when i found free concern it was like
163:25 - july of 2015 and i was i was broke i was
163:28 - a
163:29 - i had been a salesman for a startup and
163:31 - i lost my job doing that and i wasn't
163:33 - making very good money of that anyway so
163:34 - i was a janitor at night and so
163:37 - i had had it being broke i was making
163:40 - about 800 a month at that point
163:42 - and
163:43 - i just had said i really want to learn
163:45 - how to code i'm tired of i'm tired of
163:48 - just kind of all my programming friends
163:49 - were traveling and they're having good
163:51 - lives and their social media feeds made
163:53 - them look very happy and i was not
163:55 - so one
163:56 - so one night you know everybody told me
163:58 - i needed to learn javascript so
164:01 - i typed in cheap javascript resource or
164:04 - cheap javascript coding camp or
164:05 - something like that because all the boot
164:07 - camps at the time are costing 10 15
164:09 - grand
164:10 - and i didn't have that
164:12 - and i found free code camp and so it was
164:14 - about two in the morning
164:16 - as is my want because i don't sleep very
164:17 - much and i said oh and so i learned html
164:20 - in a night and i said there's something
164:22 - to this and i became really passionate
164:23 - about it because i was learning
164:25 - something for free
164:26 - i
164:27 - i realized i was on a path that was
164:28 - going to do well
164:30 - and all i had to do was put in the time
164:31 - i didn't have the brain power
164:33 - but kind of like lifting weights or
164:35 - doing anything else you just got to put
164:36 - in the time you got to put in the work
164:38 - and um so when the call came out for
164:41 - them you for us to start up like a local
164:43 - meetup i was like yes we need to do this
164:46 - and there was one already in virginia
164:47 - beach which is a city right next to
164:48 - norfolk but nobody was going to it i
164:50 - said well i have a lot of coding friends
164:52 - i can ask them to be speakers i'm sure
164:54 - they would want to contribute
164:56 - open source was kind of a new idea to me
164:59 - didn't quite know what it was it's like
165:01 - so how do you make money on this how do
165:02 - you how do you make a living at doing
165:04 - this and what i didn't realize is that
165:06 - as you build a community as you build a
165:07 - reputation
165:10 - and as you help others that that follows
165:13 - that follows suit so this was my way of
165:15 - a newbie coder not knowing how to teach
165:18 - still contributing and giving people who
165:20 - are just like me
165:21 - content that was going to be good and
165:23 - useful for them if they wanted to
165:25 - continue down that path so
165:27 - that's pretty and i've been doing it
165:28 - ever since um
165:30 - i i think i've become a lot more
165:32 - passionate about
165:33 - uh the code as well i couldn't have done
165:35 - any i i wouldn't be sitting here if it
165:37 - wasn't for like john small
165:39 - who was a guy who
165:41 - i through one of my contacts helped get
165:43 - him an internship as he came out of a
165:44 - boot camp
165:46 - and um
165:48 - he jokes he's like i don't know if the
165:49 - word blood oath
165:51 - is applicable here but he goes that's
165:52 - what i feel like and he's a very good
165:54 - programmer and he's paired programmed
165:56 - with me he's taught me a lot and then he
165:58 - just kept coming to the meetups as well
165:59 - and he's become kind of like a de facto
166:01 - admin there um
166:03 - arranging like meetups at
166:05 - nights that i can't make it
166:07 - helping with algorithm teaching
166:09 - things that i'm still not great at but
166:12 - he is um he's excellent and
166:15 - i'm really thankful that there's a part
166:17 - of the community that's just as
166:18 - passionate about teaching as i am so
166:20 - so yeah we've been doing that for almost
166:22 - four years now
166:23 - whether it be in virtual or in
166:25 - in the real trying to teach different
166:27 - topics um but at the same time still
166:29 - trying to help people as they continue
166:31 - on their coding journey and focusing on
166:33 - the free code camp curriculum has been
166:36 - kind of our focus for 2018 and that's
166:38 - really been helping so yeah yeah what do
166:40 - you all think of the new curriculum
166:43 - i i feel like i'm behind
166:46 - i got my i got my front-end
166:47 - certification in 2016
166:50 - and um
166:51 - i got my first gig coding in 2017. so
166:54 - i've been learning a lot of stuff in
166:55 - between it like i was learning ios
166:56 - development for a long time and every
166:59 - time i went back i felt like i was
167:00 - falling behind and
167:02 - i think seeing the d3 curriculum come
167:05 - out now the node curriculum being more
167:08 - robust
167:09 - seeing react every time i'm clicking on
167:11 - an arrow and i'm seeing classes scroll
167:13 - down i think that's that makes me really
167:15 - happy because
167:18 - from where it was when when we started
167:20 - out to where it is now it's just so much
167:22 - of a difference um
167:24 - you can easily get lost in like articles
167:26 - and
167:27 - and videos and those are all really
167:29 - helpful
167:30 - um
167:31 - i think it's
167:32 - the navigating of it is is the tough bit
167:34 - and i think that's where the community
167:36 - really helps and say don't focus on this
167:38 - don't focus on that focus on this and
167:39 - you can build up to that and i think
167:40 - that's that's been the fun part and and
167:43 - on the topic of just focusing on
167:44 - learning fundamentals and and
167:46 - you are doing a job that's very
167:49 - different from what you originally
167:51 - prepared for so talk a little bit about
167:53 - your transition from web development to
167:55 - mobile development to sql focus
167:57 - development yeah absolutely so um
168:00 - i
168:01 - so my uh my my
168:03 - current job is as a sql and t-sql
168:06 - transact sql developer and that's
168:07 - dealing with data
168:09 - uh within a uh financial framework um i
168:12 - had no idea what i was doing with
168:14 - databases how to import information and
168:16 - put it into a database i didn't know how
168:18 - to do any of that i had a front-end
168:20 - certification and from there i was like
168:22 - i like ios development i'm going to
168:23 - focus on that and i focus on that for
168:25 - about a year learning swift and i really
168:28 - wanted to do it and
168:30 - i was very passionate about it i was
168:32 - buying a lot of books i invested a lot
168:33 - of money and time into it and then i get
168:35 - a call from a recruiter saying hey we
168:37 - want you to be a programmer with us we
168:39 - work with databases mainly and with data
168:41 - so that would that's going to be your
168:42 - job and writing scripts for it
168:45 - and i was like okay and when i first got
168:47 - it i said well i don't know if i really
168:48 - want to do this i want to keep focusing
168:50 - on mobile but the more i started messing
168:52 - with the data and so are you writing
168:53 - python scripts and powershell scripts to
170:06 - okay i would
170:14 - there he is
170:15 - go on
170:18 - yes
170:20 - sorry about the camera thing but yeah i
170:22 - i think what i've been learning was um
170:25 - as you learned as if you're just
170:27 - starting out or if you're halfway
170:28 - through and you're not sure
170:30 - how that job is going to
170:32 - how that how all this is going to work
170:33 - out into a job
170:35 - it's going to work out in a job
170:38 - thank you thank you quincy's uh sit in
170:40 - that's very nice of you but like i said
170:42 - if you don't know how that's going to
170:43 - work out within a job or if you don't
170:44 - know
170:45 - if you end up in a situation where
170:47 - you're getting paid to be a programmer
170:49 - just go with it don't don't stress that
170:51 - it's not what you've been learning don't
170:52 - don't feel like it's been a waste of
170:54 - time because it really hasn't and
170:56 - and i've said this to you before but
170:58 - my life has been a lily pad of jobs to
171:01 - jobs to jobs and jobs and that's through
171:04 - background or education or whatever just
171:06 - circumstances and a lot of them haven't
171:07 - been the greatest but uh the universe
171:10 - god
171:11 - whatever i think the universe but will
171:14 - just throw these circumstances at you
171:15 - and you just gotta
171:17 - you just gotta kind of go with it and uh
171:19 - and in your coding journey um no matter
171:22 - what
171:23 - just try to look for the positive things
171:24 - look for the things that you like to do
171:27 - try to work on those buy a udemy course
171:29 - for 10 bucks to explore it more if
171:31 - there's no free resources do something
171:32 - like that and
171:34 - you're not going to waste a ton of money
171:35 - and you won't be disappointed i don't
171:37 - think so

174:29 - she is actually the woman who created
174:32 - the free code camp nyc facebook group
174:34 - back in the day there was a day when
174:36 - there was not a new york city group like
174:39 - one of the most popular cities in the
174:40 - world right uh so victoria thank you so
174:43 - much for joining us here
174:45 - tell us a little bit about
174:47 - your history with free code camp well
174:50 - when i initially went into free code
174:51 - camp um i was looking for javascript
174:54 - help
174:55 - i had just left a job i was doing
174:57 - freelancing and while everybody was okay
175:00 - with html css they wanted to have
175:02 - javascript and while i was familiar with
175:05 - copy paste use
175:07 - i wanted to know how it worked i found
175:09 - free code camp and started doing the
175:11 - challenges one of the challenges that
175:12 - popped up was hey if there's not a fb
175:15 - group and free code and for free code
175:18 - game why did you make it i'm like okay
175:20 - let's check
175:22 - then we had a group
175:24 - uh because i created that uh as for
175:27 - as people started joining they were
175:29 - saying let's all meet up let's all meet
175:31 - up i'm like okay it's good we had a
175:33 - couple people who have recently moved or
175:35 - had recently moved at that time uh
175:38 - wanted to meet up but uh nobody actually
175:41 - wanted to make the meet
175:42 - up so what ended up happening was i
175:46 - eventually got a couple of volunteers to
175:47 - come together to be leaders and we put
175:50 - together an idea for a coffee and code
175:53 - which we had run across on
175:54 - the free code camp
175:56 - group that quincy was running at the
175:59 - time it's still running i'm not even
176:00 - sure i'm so sorry
176:01 - [Laughter]
176:03 - um
176:04 - but we have a great thing coughing code
176:06 - meet a great make it a short thing meet
176:09 - everybody we put that together and at
176:11 - each of those meetings it kind of grew
176:13 - and grew and grew and we ended up
176:15 - meeting some people like megan like mike
176:18 - who you'll probably see later
176:20 - who ended up becoming our
176:23 - new leaders and have been holding the
176:25 - fort together for the last three years
176:27 - uh basically every so often we can get
176:29 - together and try to do something else
176:31 - like i tried to have a leader summit
176:33 - but then
176:35 - and that kind of fell through
176:38 - so i'd like to actually get more leaders
176:40 - at some point so if you're out there
176:42 - and you want to do something in new york
176:44 - city talk to me
176:46 - you got my information come talk to me
176:48 - because i want you to be a leader so
176:50 - that we can have
176:52 - one group a day studying
176:54 - every day of the week
176:56 - as long as we can okay come on in
177:00 - new york city is such a huge city there
177:02 - are so many uh people here so many
177:04 - neighborhoods so many bros
177:08 - how many different groups do you say are
177:10 - active right now to your knowledge
177:12 - within the new york city metropolitan
177:14 - area
177:16 - i've every time i find one i put it into
177:19 - our introduction
177:20 - our kind of description on new york city
177:22 - i think there was about 10 at last count
177:26 - in the metropolitan area including bronx
177:28 - and brooklyn and new jersey city and
177:32 - even something out in old bridge new
177:33 - jersey so if you're watching from old
177:35 - bridge hi
177:36 - that's pretty far out for and i have
177:39 - that listed on there
177:41 - yeah and uh i understand that you
177:44 - and mike whom we're going to hear from a
177:46 - moment
177:47 - have been considering potentially like
177:50 - we need better tooling around these
177:52 - study groups than just relying on
177:53 - facebook groups
177:55 - and and what have been some of your
177:56 - thoughts for uh
177:58 - what could make it easier for people to
178:00 - discover free code camp groups and to
178:03 - hear about them and to come to them
178:06 - so what my idea has been is to create
178:09 - something very similar to a meetup group
178:12 - but just for coders and have it at a
178:15 - website that is very prominently free
178:18 - code camp new york city and invite
178:20 - people who code to come in whether they
178:22 - know what free code camp is or not at
178:24 - the time so that they can then discover
178:27 - our wonderful group and continue their
178:29 - growth
178:30 - the idea was to have something that will
178:32 - allow us to not only have uh short once
178:35 - once one meeting events but also
178:38 - multiple events over time and maybe
178:40 - repeating events and then also huge
178:42 - events where people can discuss things
178:44 - very similar to how meetup group works
178:47 - but different in that it's a a little
178:50 - bit more facebooky that's the idea uh
178:53 - eventually we're going to get that going
178:55 - yeah well we're interested in building
178:57 - something like that we love meetup it's
178:59 - a great tool but it's like 15 20 bucks a
179:01 - month for a study group and when you
179:03 - have thousands of groups it doesn't
179:05 - really scale for a small non-profit like
179:06 - rio grande
179:08 - so uh we're i'm very interested in
179:10 - getting kind of a feature set and ideas
179:13 - and doing some user testing with you as
179:15 - a study group leader who's put a lot of
179:17 - thought into this
179:18 - um and i understand that uh as far as
179:20 - like advancing the the web presence of
179:23 - frequent new york city you've actually
179:25 - bought a few domains too yes i bought
179:28 - the couple domains of
179:31 - freecodecampnyc.com because i want
179:32 - people to not be on facebook all the
179:35 - time and still be able to access the
179:37 - same stuff that we have on facebook for
179:40 - you as well
179:42 - because i know some people don't like
179:43 - facebook and sometimes facebook hides
179:46 - posts so we don't see what they are so i
179:48 - want you to be able to find all the same
179:50 - resources specifically for new york city
179:53 - folk i mean we have a ton of resources
179:55 - on free code camp as it is but not very
179:58 - much
179:59 - like within the same city as small
180:01 - community
180:04 - great well we we cheer on your
180:07 - we turn on your efforts to uh to create
180:09 - like a a unique web presence just for
180:12 - free co camp new york city and uh i'm
180:15 - hopeful that we can be linking to that
180:17 - and if you want to have like a slack
180:18 - chat or if you want to have a discord
180:20 - server or anything like that if you want
180:22 - to have your own
180:23 - discourse server like your own forum
180:26 - we're going to try to make it to where
180:28 - you you know each study group can link
180:29 - to all these different places where the
180:31 - community congregates
180:32 - and have like they can just have that
180:34 - wherever they want and have their own
180:36 - web presence because we're huge
180:37 - believers in the open web
180:39 - everybody should have some territory of
180:41 - their own on the on the open web not
180:42 - just on these massive platforms
180:44 - uh so victoria i uh i put your twitter
180:48 - information back up on there everybody
180:49 - who's who's here in preque in new york
180:52 - city check her out she's
180:54 - kind of the the kingpin of free cocaine
180:57 - new york if you will
180:59 - thank you thank you so much victoria
181:02 - here i'll help you up it's hard to get
181:04 - out of this
181:04 - chair all right and one more free coke
181:07 - camp new york person whom i think
181:09 - everybody should get to know
181:11 - mike
181:12 - mike simcoe
181:15 - i'm gonna pull you up here as well
181:23 - i feel very embarrassed because like i
181:25 - didn't think about how much higher this
181:26 - was i'm actually not that tall of a
181:28 - person i'm like 511
181:31 - but many of the people i'm talking to
181:33 - are taller than me but they look shorter
181:35 - because of my choice of chairs sorry
181:39 - mike tell us a little bit about your
181:41 - experience uh
181:43 - venturing into software development so
181:45 - far
181:46 - oh wow
181:47 - software development well the the thing
181:49 - is that i uh it sort of was a passion
181:52 - since uh childhood uh part of it anyway
181:54 - not web development but software
181:56 - development and programming is uh so i
181:59 - i've kind of cheated i didn't start from
182:00 - ground zero i started at probably when i
182:03 - was like 12
182:04 - writing c plus code and tinkering around
182:06 - with that
182:07 - i had no idea that was going to bring me
182:09 - anywhere in life that was literally just
182:11 - a hobby people play with trains i play
182:13 - with programs
182:15 - then
182:16 - way after many years later
182:19 - i was sitting in new york
182:22 - after traveling a while and i didn't
182:24 - have a job i didn't have anything to do
182:26 - and i was just
182:28 - i randomly stumbled upon a meetup group
182:31 - which was run by victoria uh for free
182:33 - co-camp and i found the curriculum and i
182:36 - really liked how it was structured just
182:39 - like one two three from web developer
182:41 - whatever because i couldn't find before
182:43 - this website i really could not find any
182:45 - concise resources i mean there was stuff
182:47 - you know codecademy whatever there was
182:49 - things that are available but they were
182:51 - kind of disjointed or they were in the
182:52 - form of just like here's a tutorial and
182:54 - then you're done here it was like
182:56 - one two three
182:58 - non-profit projects all of that and it
183:01 - felt like
183:02 - it felt like exactly what i was looking
183:03 - for that i couldn't find before so i
183:05 - started going the program i realized i
183:07 - had a passion for teaching at that point
183:10 - which i didn't know before uh because uh
183:12 - just helping out um explaining complex
183:15 - subjects i guess i have a i got a knack
183:18 - for it just explaining things like even
183:20 - little things like for loops and while
183:22 - loops and enclosures and you know
183:24 - whatever and higher order functions
183:28 - and somehow i'm able to explain it to
183:30 - people in the way they don't they'll
183:32 - understand and another thing which is
183:35 - kind of weird
183:36 - the
183:36 - the best kept secret is
183:39 - if you want to learn something better
183:40 - teach it to somebody else
183:42 - you learn a lot by teaching people you
183:44 - do and i never knew that until i joined
183:46 - the group and i met awesome people at
183:48 - this group i met victoria i met some of
183:52 - my best friends here um and now now this
183:55 - is basically
183:57 - i'm i'm stuck with it
183:58 - i wanna see you know um i i even
184:02 - transition into web development uh
184:04 - full-time freelance web development
184:06 - that's what i do i don't actually have a
184:07 - job i was going through a program and i
184:09 - found that i
184:10 - it just organically happened i learned
184:12 - enough through the program where i was
184:14 - able to start taking on clients of my
184:15 - own
184:16 - and uh
184:18 - just one day i woke up and realized hey
184:20 - i can do this so that's how that happens
184:23 - so describe that moment when you realize
184:25 - hey i can succeed as a freelancer like
184:27 - was there some specific i mean you woke
184:29 - up but was there some specific sequence
184:31 - of events where your confidence kind of
184:33 - kicked in
184:34 - um
184:37 - well
184:41 - yes uh but that moment probably did not
184:44 - happen when i was until i was like face
184:46 - to face with a client
184:49 - because my kind of teaching mode kicked
184:51 - in because i'm a teacher first i was a
184:53 - teacher first and a developer second and
184:56 - when i put my first ad online i was
184:58 - super nervous it was a completely lame
185:00 - ad honestly it was not i'm a developer i
185:03 - can build a website for you it literally
185:06 - was a one line thing that said um
185:09 - that said
185:11 - web programmer fixing website fixing
185:13 - broken websites
185:15 - that's what it said a fixing website
185:17 - problems and i got a call from uh from a
185:19 - lady uh who uh had a private business
185:23 - and she
185:24 - um she had a complaint that her website
185:26 - looked crappy on mobile it didn't work
185:28 - very good didn't look well on mobile at
185:30 - all and
185:32 - i was about halfway through you know i
185:35 - was about in the middle of the freako
185:37 - champs thing and the idea wasn't even
185:38 - finished i was like oh yeah there's this
185:40 - thing called bootstrap i could totally
185:42 - help you out
185:45 - and that's where the confidence happened
185:46 - because i realized she was looking at me
185:49 - for solutions
185:50 - she wasn't judging me she wasn't testing
185:52 - me she wasn't like oh you know let me
185:54 - see what your credentials are or
185:56 - whatever she was looking to me for
185:58 - solutions and i had and i had the
186:00 - solution she was looking for i was like
186:02 - i've done this i can do this i you know
186:04 - whatever and then after that it just
186:07 - started up i realized that clients are
186:09 - they're basically like students because
186:10 - part of what you do is you educate
186:12 - you educate you meet with them
186:15 - because they tell you what they think
186:16 - they want
186:18 - sorry sorry about that uh you have to uh
186:21 - they they tell you what they think they
186:23 - want and it's your job to actually
186:26 - give them what they need including the
186:28 - knowledge and the things so
186:31 - it that's when it happened for me it
186:33 - happened for me
186:35 - after a face-to-face meeting not when i
186:37 - woke up when i woke up i was like i
186:39 - gotta try and i i didn't have confidence
186:42 - i had i had lots of stage fright i was
186:44 - like i don't know how i'm going to meet
186:46 - this person even when they contacted me
186:48 - and said i want to meet you at this cafe
186:50 - at this time i was nervous i was
186:52 - overdressed i was doing all that crazy
186:54 - crap that you do when you go on an
186:55 - interview
186:57 - and then i showed up and i was like
186:59 - tell me your story right and she's
187:01 - talking and i'm listening and i'm
187:03 - realizing i'm just
187:05 - i'm just being a friend here at this
187:06 - point i'm being a friend and i'm being
187:08 - an advisor like what can i do to this
187:10 - person what can i do for this person and
187:12 - um
187:14 - that's that's kind of when it hit me
187:16 - it sounds like you've picked up so many
187:18 - uh
187:19 - insights about freelancing over over the
187:21 - years
187:22 - and
187:23 - um i would encourage you to write about
187:25 - it or create a video series
187:27 - this is one of the most common questions
187:30 - i get is how should i get involved in
187:31 - freelancing and i tell people check out
187:33 - the freelancer show
187:34 - uh it's a podcast it's pretty good buy a
187:36 - bunch of long-term freelancers but what
187:40 - would be the single like if you had a
187:42 - single thing that you give
187:44 - as advice for people who want to get
187:45 - into freelancing who've been working
187:47 - through the free cocaine curriculum or
187:49 - have been just building projects on
187:51 - their own for a while and really want to
187:52 - start making some money as a freelancer
187:54 - what would be your single
187:56 - best advice for them
188:03 - the single best advice for them well
188:06 - how about this
188:11 - okay
188:14 - you
188:16 - are the expert
188:19 - chances are your client knows a lot less
188:22 - than you do about what he's asking you
188:23 - to do this is why he's hiring you
188:26 - so you are the expert and in that role
188:32 - this is this is a people position almost
188:35 - it's your job to convince the client
188:37 - that you can do what's best for them
188:39 - and
188:44 - i guess i want to say uh
188:49 - like they say in a joke they're more
188:50 - afraid of you than you are of them
188:52 - so that's
188:54 - you you don't need to be ashamed you
188:55 - don't need to be afraid whatever you
188:57 - think you don't know and we all struggle
188:59 - with this all the time we all struggle
189:01 - with the uh the so-called imposter
189:04 - syndrome
189:05 - they know a lot less and they're coming
189:07 - to you for advice and your job is to
189:09 - give them that advice
189:12 - if you're trying to get into freelancing
189:14 - just do it just start now start small
189:16 - don't uh
189:18 - don't worry about even if you put an ad
189:21 - out there and the first person you get
189:23 - is just
189:25 - not the kind of client you would want i
189:27 - mean there are different circumstances
189:30 - keep trying and just grab that first one
189:32 - after that first one that first
189:34 - assignment whether it's just do this one
189:36 - page for
189:38 - i'm not gonna you don't want to name
189:39 - actual money figures but here's
189:41 - just do this one page for not very much
189:44 - money just do it this is when you get
189:46 - your first kind of grasp of the skills
189:48 - that you possess you realize what you
189:50 - can do what you can do well
189:53 - so

190:25 - thank you so much mike for leading the
190:27 - group for sharing your insights on
190:28 - freelancing and
190:30 - i i speak i think for most of the
190:32 - community when i say we'd love to have
190:33 - some more articles that lay out some of
190:35 - your insights because it sounds like
190:37 - you've been through a lot and you've
190:38 - learned a lot from the process
190:44 - all right thanks mike
190:49 - yeah let's change it up yeah can we uh
190:52 - can we
190:53 - so i'd like to interview both of them
190:55 - yeah
190:57 - yeah jump over here
190:59 - i'm gonna sit in this egg chair for a
191:01 - change
191:02 - wow just sitting in here the sound is so
191:04 - different
191:07 - it's like putting your head under water
191:10 - yeah so i'm here with two amazing people
191:14 - johnny bissell
191:15 - and
191:16 - uh
191:17 - and manish geary
191:19 - thank you so much gentlemen for flying
191:21 - out from your respective cities uh first
191:25 - tell us a little bit about yourself
191:26 - johnny
191:27 - hi everyone
191:29 - i'm johnny bizzle i was a
191:32 - c-sharp
191:34 - vb.net developer
191:36 - for
191:38 - seven years with the
191:40 - knowledge of sql
191:42 - what i found was
191:44 - i was working on web forms and quite old
191:47 - technology and i really wanted to learn
191:49 - new things like node and mongodb
191:53 - and um
191:55 - one of the guys that was working with
191:57 - recommended pre-code camp
191:59 - so i thought yeah i'll give it a try and
192:03 - that was about two and a bit years ago
192:05 - and i'm still plodding along through the
192:07 - massive course but don't let that put
192:09 - you off it's very good there's lots in
192:11 - there
192:14 - um
192:15 - so the the goal is to
192:18 - upskill basically
192:20 - with new technologies
192:22 - and
192:25 - get get more relevant
192:27 - up-to-date work
192:29 - and along the ride i've spent a lot of
192:32 - time on the forum and the chat rooms
192:33 - helping out
192:35 - new beginners
192:37 - which has also aided my
192:40 - learning process
192:44 - so it's been it's been great and the the
192:46 - course has improved over the years
192:48 - and i've made lots of friends
192:52 - i encourage people to
192:54 - network and prepare program and meet
192:58 - other developers because it's difficult
193:00 - to motivate yourself doing stuff just
193:02 - purely on you
193:03 - on yourself
193:05 - um
193:07 - so yeah any more questions yeah yeah i
193:09 - got a ton of questions first let's hear
193:11 - from manish
193:12 - thank you so much for joining us
193:15 - thank you uh thank you for having me
193:16 - here
193:17 - my name is manish i am a
193:19 - grad student in uc cincinnati university
193:21 - of cincinnati in ohio
193:23 - i did my engineering from india in
193:25 - computer science
193:27 - and
193:27 - [Music]
193:28 - after that i decided to get a higher
193:31 - higher degree in computer science so i
193:33 - joined uc
193:35 - since then it's been a good journey i've
193:37 - started getting to getting into more
193:39 - more into software development starting
193:40 - with java and then recently i came
193:43 - across
193:44 - i decided to get into javascript because
193:48 - what's more important for me is to build
193:50 - something and just see it happening
193:52 - right in front of me that's that's where
193:54 - javascript is more powerful than java
193:56 - because you don't need a lot of things
193:57 - to set it up you can do it immediately
193:59 - with javascript just open your browser
194:01 - write your code and you're done so
194:03 - that's how i got into javascript and
194:04 - that's how i got into free code cam
194:06 - actually because uh when i was learning
194:08 - javascript they were just tutorials
194:10 - everywhere you read read read and
194:12 - there's no coding exercises or
194:14 - challenges that's where free codecam was
194:16 - helpful because i saw there were a
194:18 - series of code challenges you learn you
194:20 - write you see your code if it doesn't
194:22 - pass you ask for help and that's how you
194:24 - learn and uh
194:25 - i've been with free code camp for about
194:27 - two years now two three years now it's
194:29 - it's been a pretty good journey so far
194:31 - you're pretty good at helping other
194:33 - people
194:34 - uh yeah i used to i used to hang around
194:37 - in the health chat rooms me and there
194:39 - was one more camper called stephen james
194:41 - i mean he's a legend in the chat rooms
194:44 - so it was fun hanging around there
194:46 - and yeah i hope to continue more in this
194:48 - journey
194:50 - yeah thank you manish and and so those
194:53 - of you watching both of these gentlemen
194:54 - are
194:55 - tremendous contributors to the free
194:56 - cocaine community johnny bizzle is one
194:59 - of the most prominent uh people helping
195:01 - people on the forum i looked the other
195:04 - day uh i i looked earlier i was like i
195:06 - wonder how long johnny spent on the
195:08 - forum and discourse uh the the forum
195:10 - software we use uh which is great it's
195:12 - open source check it out um
195:16 - it said that johnny bizzle has spent the
195:18 - equivalent of five waking days
195:20 - on the forum helping people
195:23 - five days of his life that's not
195:25 - including sleeping and everything that's
195:26 - like five days at his computer
195:29 - making people's lives easier by
195:30 - answering their many questions and that
195:32 - that is so profound so
195:34 - johnny tell us a little bit about what
195:36 - drives you to help so many people would
195:38 - you say is there any
195:39 - is there some moment where somebody
195:41 - helped you
195:42 - or do you just enjoy helping people what
195:44 - what causes you to be such a
195:46 - super helpful person
195:49 - i would say that that probably comes
195:51 - from
195:52 - um
195:54 - my i realize i've got the experience of
195:57 - coding so i enjoy going up
196:00 - i think as well you used to give brownie
196:02 - points for
196:03 - people helping i thought hey i can get
196:05 - some brownie fires here
196:07 - those are coming back and then
196:10 - and then uh
196:12 - i was trying to keep the street going i
196:14 - got a streak going for about 194 days or
196:16 - something
196:18 - a lot easier than doing projects for 194
196:21 - days
196:22 - so some of that was a bit of
196:23 - procrastination
196:25 - plus as well
196:28 - there's other people that i met through
196:30 - doing that
196:31 - uh who i now speak to on a more
196:34 - one-to-one basis
196:35 - and um again that that motivates you to
196:38 - see people
196:39 - progressing through the course
196:42 - so
196:44 - yeah i guess because i've got a certain
196:46 - level of knowledge i want to share that
196:48 - and um
196:50 - and i think it's better to give than to
196:52 - receive
196:53 - as
196:54 - quincy comes from a teaching background
196:56 - as well and not my parents come from
196:58 - that background as well so
197:00 - um i guess so that's where i get the
197:02 - inspiration from
197:04 - uh but yeah and it is something to do so
197:08 - maybe
197:10 - maybe when i'm working on a project
197:13 - i just want to break from that i'll dip
197:15 - into the forum or dip in the chat room
197:17 - to see what's going on
197:19 - and it's just a case of breaking off
197:22 - from
197:23 - focusing on the same thing all the time
197:25 - as well that's another reason for doing
197:27 - it
197:28 - so yeah
197:32 - and manish how about you you've been
197:34 - such a prolific contributor to the code
197:35 - base
197:37 - what what has spurred you to to jump in
197:40 - and help out so much
197:42 - when i started learning uh when i had
197:44 - questions or when i had doubts the only
197:47 - place i used to go to was stack overflow
197:49 - and unfortunately people in
197:50 - stackoverflow are not very helpful most
197:52 - of the time
197:53 - no not friendly at all so you would feel
197:56 - hesitant to ask questions which you
197:58 - normally could ask free in a chat room
198:00 - or in a forum
198:01 - so when i joined free code camp i saw
198:03 - that there are chat rooms where people
198:05 - are willing to help
198:06 - it's not just it's not they're not
198:08 - condescending or they're not uh they
198:10 - don't expect you to know everything
198:11 - before you ask a question so it's okay
198:13 - to not not know everything and ask
198:16 - no one will scold you for it no one will
198:18 - think bad for it
198:19 - so that's how i got into free code cam
198:21 - and then i saw the code base on github
198:24 - and i realized there were a few aspects
198:26 - where i already knew things
198:28 - stuff like
198:29 - regular expressions or
198:31 - front-end framework like react or
198:34 - angularjs where it was previously at
198:36 - so i identified things where i could
198:38 - contribute and
198:39 - obviously the more you write code in uh
198:43 - that works in a real-life production
198:44 - scenario the more you learn
198:46 - so i thought that was a good way of
198:49 - uh upping my skills even more so that's
198:51 - how i started contributing to it and the
198:53 - more you do it the more you get
198:55 - attracted to it so it's it's always a
198:57 - good challenge to learn more and
198:59 - contribute more so that's how i got into
199:01 - it
199:02 - i'd like to add the um there's lots of
199:04 - people on the forums and the chat rooms
199:07 - who will suggest tools to you that
199:09 - are just fantastic like python tutor
199:12 - fantastic online tool for debugging code
199:15 - um
199:16 - so
199:17 - there's that benefit as well okay just
199:19 - people recommending tools and things all
199:22 - the time
199:24 - another great reason to get involved
199:29 - speaking of getting involved both of you
199:31 - have been so involved over the past few
199:33 - years and uh i like to think a free
199:36 - cocaine is still being very early days
199:38 - if you look at if you look at free code
199:39 - camp and then if you look at like
199:41 - wikipedia.org
199:42 - wikipedia has been going for about 18
199:44 - years now and pre-co camp is tracking
199:46 - very closely to wikipedia's
199:49 - uh
199:50 - trajectory you know like in terms of
199:52 - total use
199:53 - usage of the
199:55 - the web application and the total number
199:57 - of
199:57 - articles and contributors and things
199:59 - like that for example
200:00 - wikipedia has about a hundred thousand
200:02 - total contributors and free code camp
200:04 - has thousands so we're on the same uh
200:07 - order of magnitude basically we're on
200:08 - the trajectory to to we'd like to be
200:11 - wikipedia for learning about technology
200:14 - uh and
200:16 - you gentlemen seem to be very long-term
200:18 - thinking and you've got bright careers
200:20 - ahead of you
200:21 - what are
200:22 - some ways that you think you might be
200:24 - able to contribute to the developer
200:26 - community
200:27 - through free coding and other resources
200:29 - going forward
200:32 - do you want to take that one firstly
200:36 - well i would just hope to continue to
200:39 - [Music]
200:40 - help people on the forums maybe
200:43 - also
200:47 - run the leads meet up
200:50 - so
200:52 - helping those guys getting through the
200:54 - the early stages
200:56 - the
200:57 - the very difficult thing about
201:00 - an online course and courses in general
201:03 - is keeping it up to date
201:05 - and
201:06 - there's always something new coming on
201:09 - on board so it's really important that
201:12 - everything stays relevant and up-to-date
201:15 - because there's nothing worse than say
201:16 - when you buy a book and it's already
201:18 - talking about the old version of that
201:21 - code and you think well should i be
201:22 - learning python 2.7 when version 3.4 is
201:26 - out
201:28 - i could i'm sure you'd appreciate the
201:30 - frustration of that you might write a
201:32 - load of
201:34 - challenges and things already out of
201:36 - date how frustrating that be so
201:39 - hopefully i can help
201:41 - keep things up today and keep things
201:43 - relevant
201:45 - um
201:46 - i think that's that's
201:48 - one of the challenges
201:50 - for
201:53 - yeah of course i agree uh one more thing
201:55 - i can think of is free code camp has the
201:57 - guides recently in in github it is a
202:00 - wonderful resource just like wikipedia
202:02 - it's not just limited to react or or
202:04 - front-end there there are topics on a
202:06 - whole lot of sections like python java
202:09 - os operating system so what i what i
202:11 - think is if if we push
202:14 - to uh make guides a more accessible and
202:16 - more
202:17 - in a way that uh beginners who are new
202:20 - to free code camp they contribute more
202:21 - to guides
202:22 - that would help and what i've noticed is
202:24 - that even in the main free code camp
202:26 - repo there are sometimes issues with
202:28 - newcomers trying to set up their
202:30 - repositories and it's not working out in
202:32 - their local environments
202:33 - so that maybe we could uh contribute to
202:36 - that so that that in turn helps out
202:38 - newcomers to get set up far far faster
202:42 - than
202:43 - so
202:44 - that's what i think
202:47 - well uh
202:48 - thank you so much for joining us you all
202:50 - have the distinction of being our last
202:52 - interview for the evening
202:56 - yeah yeah go grab a beer
202:58 - i'm gonna i'm gonna grab some soda i
203:00 - don't drink beer but uh i'm i'm a uh i
203:03 - don't drink the big run tomorrow
203:05 - yeah yeah yeah take care of yourself
203:07 - gotta maybe load up on some carbs over
203:09 - here we've got all these sandwiches left
203:11 - but uh thank you so much for coming out
203:14 - we're gonna have top contributor parties

203:41 - uh contribute to the community and we'll
203:44 - make the list of
203:46 - very elite capable
203:48 - people who are helping drive this
203:51 - community forward and helping
203:54 - set the course for so many people who
203:56 - want to become developers and who want
203:57 - to become more technical and break into
204:00 - break into tech
204:01 - so thank you both gentlemen and thank
204:04 - you everybody for watching these
204:05 - interviews i think we're going to do

205:23 - chance to uh talk to so many people that
205:26 - i want to but um
205:28 - stick around i think we're gonna we're
205:30 - gonna clean up real quick we've got lots
205:31 - of food if you want to take some home
205:32 - with you
205:33 - uh i'm gonna take a lot of food and
205:36 - stuff into my pockets and maybe do this
205:38 - the santa salmon thing from that movie
205:42 - if anybody
205:43 - remembers that movie uh
205:46 - dan aykroyd dressed up as a santa
205:48 - putting a
205:49 - salmon in yeah trading places thank you
205:51 - such a good movie do you want to go back
205:53 - and watch like a politically incorrect
205:55 - 1980s movie that's a great place to
205:56 - start
205:58 - so um
206:01 - i am so thrilled that everybody came and
206:06 - free code camp is early days
206:08 - we are
206:10 - rapidly growing in terms of people in
206:13 - the community the amount of things out
206:15 - there that we're uh creating for other
206:17 - people to learn from the amount of
206:21 - rock star
206:22 - developers and teachers that are that
206:25 - are coming through free code camp
206:27 - so
206:28 - we want to absolutely continue to
206:30 - facilitate as many people as possible
206:32 - who want to learn to code because
206:34 - my firm belief is that
206:37 - just like you had to learn to read
206:40 - when powerpoint type slides and things
206:42 - like that in the 90s if you wanted to
206:43 - continue to work as a knowledge worker
206:46 - now you need to learn to code and
206:48 - regardless of
206:50 - how your job may seem like oh i don't
206:53 - necessarily see where coding would be
206:55 - directly applicable to this i think it
206:57 - will be sooner or later because what
206:59 - we're seeing is jobs are the
207:01 - expectations are just getting higher and
207:03 - higher for your understanding of
207:05 - technology to be able to take these
207:09 - mainframes that we carry around in our
207:11 - pockets
207:12 - and put them to work for us because most
207:15 - of the work in society today is done not
207:18 - by humans but by robots
207:20 - and there's a very small
207:23 - category of people who are telling those
207:25 - robots what to do but we want everybody
207:27 - to be able to tell those robots what to
207:29 - do we want to have everybody
207:32 - empowered with the rapidly
207:36 - exploding
207:38 - computational power
207:40 - that is falling in price every year that
207:43 - we can all put to work
207:45 - so that everybody is you know a tony
207:47 - stark like superhuman who can just
207:50 - command the world around them and we'll
207:52 - get there very soon
207:54 - and uh so i'm optimistic that by helping
207:56 - more people
207:58 - become comfortable with technology
208:00 - and learn how to code and learn how to
208:02 - uh work with databases and use all these
208:04 - tools at our disposal
208:07 - we'll be able to
208:08 - you know expedite the the arrival of the
208:10 - singularity like a post-scarcity society
208:14 - where everybody's just
208:15 - super enriched and everybody is able to
208:20 - live lives of leisure and lives of mind
208:24 - so what we're going to absolutely get
208:25 - there and everybody in this room is
208:26 - helping us get there faster so thank you
208:30 - [Applause]
208:38 - and and for everybody who's watching
208:39 - this again i hope some of these amazing
208:41 - people have inspired you to get involved
208:44 - in the developer community and to
208:46 - contribute to open source and to turn
208:48 - around and teach all the things that
208:50 - you're learning and to to be
208:53 - utterly voracious and relentless in your
208:55 - personal development
208:58 - so we're gonna pack everything up we're
209:00 - gonna go if anybody wants to go uh grab
209:02 - a drink or grab a dessert i'm not sure
209:04 - where we're gonna go but i do think we
209:05 - need to leave this place far too late
209:08 - thank you again everybody for um for
209:11 - being here
209:14 - [Applause]
214:15 - you
