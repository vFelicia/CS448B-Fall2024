00:00 - webflow is a web design tool that lets
00:02 - users build websites visually without
00:04 - needing to write code using a drag and
00:06 - drop interface in this course ashak
00:09 - Kumar will teach you the basics of using
00:11 - webflow to develop a website without a
00:13 - single line of code he's an experienced
00:16 - developer and teacher hey do you want to
00:19 - learn how to build a website without
00:21 - writing a single line of code if yes
00:24 - then you are at the right place in this
00:26 - video I'm going to show you how you can
00:29 - use wlow a no code website builder tool
00:33 - to create interactive and advanced
00:37 - websites without writing a single line
00:40 - of code my name is ashoke and you are
00:43 - watching the wfl crash course
00:46 - 2024 so let's dive in hey so first thing
00:51 - we are going to learn the layouts how
00:53 - you can create layouts in webflow using
00:56 - flexbox CSS grid columns or images
01:01 - buttons headings and paragraphs to
01:03 - create a nice looking website so as you
01:06 - can see on my screen here I have a wlow
01:09 - project open but before that let's
01:12 - discuss this pixel website uh I want to
01:15 - discuss about the layout here so as you
01:17 - can see it's a
01:19 - layout of uh one column right one column
01:24 - layout or just a one row layout right
01:27 - inside that you have heading you have a
01:29 - paragraph and and you have a button here
01:31 - right after that you have image or let's
01:34 - say you can create a video or anything
01:37 - that you want right you have it's a one
01:40 - column layout right but here you see
01:44 - it's a two column
01:46 - layout so layout is the most important
01:49 - thing when you are building a website if
01:52 - your designer is providing something to
01:54 - you uh in in a figma file on this pixel
01:57 - file we are using this pixel a lot these
02:00 - days to create designs you can uh give
02:03 - it a try it's not a sponsored video but
02:06 - you can give it a try it's an amazing
02:08 - tool right here all these Ticky
02:11 - interactions right uh to create uh
02:14 - interactive layout see the way they are
02:16 - creating these layouts uh here again one
02:20 - column but here you have let's say a
02:22 - gried layout of four five items in that
02:25 - grid here again you have a two column
02:29 - layout
02:30 - uh two column layout but you are using
02:33 - uh let's say 2x one uh grids here right
02:37 - two rows and one column and here you
02:40 - only have one column so uh websites are
02:45 - always built using these layouts these
02:48 - grids and columns and rows uh that you
02:51 - can use to create uh any kind of website
02:54 - whether uh it's an
02:56 - animation uh website or whether it's a
02:59 - just a simple website a simple landing
03:01 - page you must have knowledge about the
03:04 - layouts if you see any design let's say
03:07 - if if I if I just see this design right
03:10 - I I I must have this idea in my mind
03:12 - that okay I will use something like Grid
03:15 - or let's say flax box to create a layout
03:18 - like this that is must right if you want
03:21 - to learn the basics of flax boox or the
03:23 - CSS grid I already have videos on my
03:26 - channel you can go through them and you
03:28 - can learn the basics of them so that uh
03:30 - you can create these Advanced
03:32 - layouts okay so that's it for now on
03:35 - this page let's go to
03:38 - wlow uh a website is always using images
03:44 - headings buttons paragraphs and colors
03:48 - right to create uh a nice looking
03:53 - website so on webflow here I have panel
03:56 - like a top bar where you can see you
03:59 - have
04:00 - desktop breakpoint tablet breakpoint you
04:03 - have a landscape mobile breakpoint and
04:06 - you also have a vertical mobile or let's
04:08 - a portrait uh breakpoint if you want to
04:12 - add extra let's say 1280 pixel 1440 or
04:16 - 1920 you can do it from here by by just
04:19 - clicking this 1920 it will add a 1920 uh
04:23 - with of breakpoint for your
04:26 - website uh here you have designing
04:30 - where you can edit the website you can
04:32 - design the website right now you are
04:33 - designing the website if so let's say
04:36 - any owner of the website just give you
04:38 - the editor access right then you'll be
04:40 - able to edit to the website only nothing
04:42 - else you can do that here you can see
04:45 - the status uh if the site is auto saved
04:47 - or not uh here you can export the code
04:51 - you click that on this uh this code like
04:54 - icon you can export the code right now
04:57 - we don't have anything right that's why
04:58 - nothing is there
05:00 - uh JS file and all these HTML files I
05:05 - don't want anything right now here you
05:07 - can leave comments you can leave let's
05:10 - say you you have a website ready and now
05:12 - you send it to your client or to your
05:15 - team member so they can leave comment a
05:17 - designer who can leave comment just go
05:19 - there and just write their comment just
05:21 - like in figma or in pixo we do right you
05:23 - can leave comments uh you can by
05:26 - clicking this play icon you can uh
05:28 - preview your website here
05:30 - by clicking again you can just come out
05:32 - of it and if you want to share you can
05:35 - share a readon link readon link means if
05:37 - I just share this read only link with
05:39 - anyone they can uh view my designer mode
05:43 - this is a designer mode they can view my
05:44 - designer mode and and they just see okay
05:48 - this is how they build the site if you
05:50 - want to send it to any employers right
05:52 - any agencies then you are looking for a
05:54 - job then if you're I highly recommend
05:56 - you share the read only link so that
05:57 - they know the structure of creating a
05:59 - web website how you are creating a
06:01 - website so I think it will add some
06:04 - chances of getting hired
06:06 - you and Publishing here you have a
06:10 - staging domain and here you have a
06:12 - custom domain about this one we'll talk

09:57 - and and you can use it for many times
09:59 - you want using a predefined CMS
10:03 - fields and then you have the elements
10:06 - see this is the structure you have a
10:08 - section and a container inside that one
10:10 - and we have a na bar right if I just
10:12 - select the section and I do contrl c and
10:14 - control V I can just copy paste like
10:18 - that and uh you have these components
10:22 - components is something let's say uh
10:25 - this header right you're going to use
10:27 - this header on all the pages of your
10:29 - website right then you need this
10:32 - component so I just select this section
10:35 - here uh on the right hand side panel on
10:37 - the style panel you see create component
10:40 - if I click that I just name it let's say
10:43 - header and I just create it so now it's
10:47 - green now it become green and you can
10:50 - use it anywhere you want I just uh click
10:53 - anywhere outside of this green one and I

11:09 - change here let's see if I make any
11:10 - change here from the settings I want to
11:13 - make it let's say homes see this is how
11:16 - component works if you make change at
11:18 - one place it will reflect to every other
11:21 - places where you use this component on
11:23 - your website right uh that's uh and you
11:27 - can see all your components here you can
11:29 - manage them and the next thing is
11:33 - variables so variables is something that
11:36 - you can use to store pre uh prein things

13:05 - variables and this is style selectors
13:09 - all the styles that you have I have this
13:11 - one right that's why I can see that you

14:55 - this one if you want to integrate with
14:58 - third party apps
15:01 - uh that was your uh by
15:04 - editing to create a website right this
15:07 - panel is used to add let's say CMS Pages

15:19 - new
15:20 - folder or let me delete these things I
15:22 - don't want them here right
15:24 - now so here on the right hand side I see
15:28 - the style pan where you can add a class
15:31 - right now we have this heading class you
15:33 - can add any class let's say H1 this is
15:37 - your heading class right you can create
15:40 - multiple classes like
15:41 - this let's say I just add again that
15:47 - one I mostly use this uh control e to
15:52 - just search for the item that I
15:55 - want and I'll add here H1 edit class if
15:59 - I want to use this H1 anywhere I want
16:02 - let's say I add a new uh paragraph let's
16:05 - say paragraph I want to make my
16:06 - paragraph to look like H1 so what I'll
16:09 - do I'll just type H1 and I can just
16:12 - click and select that one so that will
16:14 - uh use that
16:17 - item right and
16:21 - uh after that you have a layout and by
16:27 - default it is a block you can use flax
16:30 - box you can use grid I'll show you right
16:34 - now uh you can use in blind block you
16:37 - can have in
16:38 - line you can hide the element also if
16:41 - you want to let's say I want to create a
16:44 - two column layout right so I'll just hit
16:47 - contr e and I'll just write
16:50 - cre and I'll just hit enter so I have
16:53 - just added a grid here and uh I want to
16:56 - create this grid let's say I just want
17:00 - two columns and one row right to edit a
17:03 - grid you click on here hit a grid and it
17:06 - will open so here you have two columns
17:09 - it says two columns two rows right I
17:11 - want only one row so I'll just delete
17:14 - that Row from there so now I have
17:16 - something like this and uh on the left
17:20 - hand side I want to use an image so
17:22 - before that I will add a du
17:25 - block here as you can see inside grid I
17:28 - have a d block and I'll just copy paste
17:31 - that d block again so that on one column
17:34 - I have D second column I also have a
17:36 - D in the first d block I want to add an
17:39 - image so I'll just do contr e
17:42 - image here I can choose image from
17:49 - here and
17:51 - here I can add
17:55 - heading I can add paragraph okay so I
17:58 - have a par paragraph here okay by
18:00 - default on body I will just remove this
18:03 - H1 so that uh that large heading is gone
18:07 - now and I want to have a button so I'll
18:10 - just hit so whatever you want let's say
18:12 - button list heading paragraph so you can
18:16 - just drag and drop here so I have this
18:19 - layout now and if you want to put some
18:22 - spacing here just click on this grid and
18:26 - for columns I want let's say 40 pixel
18:29 - or let's say 80 pixel right to make it
18:32 - look better so now I have 80 pixel of
18:36 - that and I want this in the center I
18:40 - don't want this Blank Space there so
18:43 - I'll select that particular D I want to
18:45 - make it in the center the content
18:46 - whatever the content is there in that du
18:48 - block I want them to be in the
18:51 - center so I'll just here on this right
18:54 - hand side you have align justify order
18:57 - in the Align I'll just make like that so
19:00 - now that thing is in the
19:03 - center the same thing you can achieve
19:06 - using flax
19:08 - boox right so let me just uh
19:11 - here quick stack and I just use this
19:15 - quick stack here see I'll
19:19 - just copy
19:21 - this uh in that set let's just copy this
19:25 - image let's copy that image and in that
19:27 - set let's copy this do in this
19:31 - cell see again you have the same layout
19:34 - now you want to add something let's say
19:36 - here we had 80 80 so right now by
19:40 - default it leaves some
19:43 - speeding so let's remove
19:50 - them like this want to make it in the
19:54 - center can do that from here
19:56 - also the center see the same layout you
19:59 - can achieve using grid and flex box okay
20:04 - so that is what the use of layout you
20:07 - can use flx box and CSS grid you have
20:11 - pings
20:12 - margins you have size you have this
20:16 - ratio overflow fet all these things that
20:19 - you need a typography to change let's
20:22 - say I want to change its color to Red
20:25 - that's it right uh next you have
20:30 - backgrounds if you want to add a
20:31 - background image or background color
20:33 - let's say I want to change its
20:34 - background color to I just click here I
20:38 - just want to make it background color to
20:39 - this that matches with my red color and
20:42 - I want to leave some pedding because I
20:44 - don't like this uh uh this it it is
20:49 - attached with the boundaries right I I I
20:51 - want to leave some pedding from the
20:52 - boundary let me do that here I have 26
20:57 - and I'll add 26 from bottom I already I
21:00 - have from top because of this adding as
21:02 - you can see
21:03 - 20 right so this is how you can add
21:08 - background colors text colors from
21:11 - typography you can have borders all
21:14 - borders or just individual borders you
21:16 - can have H sorry this was for radius and
21:19 - this is for Border top border bottom
21:22 - right and left you can have a dash let's
21:24 - say I want all borders I want a border
21:28 - but Dash B and I want to make it a red
21:31 - one and make it let's say two two pixel
21:35 - so it's it looks like a
21:37 - card right and uh I can have a radius
21:42 - let's say all sides I want a radius
21:44 - Corner radius 16 pixel just look at this
21:48 - we just made few changes and it's
21:50 - looking a little good not that good you
21:55 - have these blending options all these
21:57 - are for images and converting something
22:00 - 2D and 3D transforms for uh let's say
22:04 - scale rotates Q whatever you want to do
22:07 - you can do that from here you can reset
22:08 - your changes from just clicking on that
22:10 - blue one and you just hit reset and it
22:12 - will be

24:13 - build a simple landing page where we
24:15 - will use
24:17 - CMS we will use uh all the concept that
24:20 - we have learned CSS grid and flax boox
24:23 - and also we are going to use some
24:26 - animations to make uh page interactive
24:30 - right so I hope you enjoy this video and
24:32 - stay tuned for the next one bye hey guys
24:36 - welcome back to our series of WL crash
24:39 - course in this one I'm going to show you
24:42 - how you can create a landing page using
24:44 - wlow without writing code and we are
24:47 - only going to use wlow core features
24:49 - that I showed you in the last video as
24:52 - you can see here on my design let me
24:54 - just uh shrink this camera uh as you can
24:57 - see I have a design here uh done in
25:01 - pixel I'm using this pixel you can use
25:03 - this pixel also uh I think because it's
25:06 - a it's quite uh alternative to figma and
25:09 - it's also free you can use this you can
25:11 - give it a try and if you want this
25:13 - design file you can check out the link
25:15 - given in the description and you can
25:17 - also play with uh the file and you can
25:19 - also convert the landing page you can
25:22 - follow the process so that you can learn
25:25 - by doing right so as you can see I have
25:28 - a design I have a naar the one that we
25:30 - have discussed in the last video right
25:33 - and I have a single column layout here
25:36 - uh with like let's say here we we could
25:39 - use a flx boox here I have a hero image
25:42 - here I have this client logos here I
25:45 - have this feature sections right uh left
25:48 - and right of one uh here we have these
25:52 - latest news here I'm going to show you
25:54 - how you can use wlow CMS I have promised
25:57 - you this one in the last video here we
26:01 - have a CTS section and our photo section
26:04 - so only few sections are there I think
26:07 - the these section are enough to learn
26:09 - wlow Basics to create any page because
26:12 - here we are going to create uh cover
26:14 - flexbox CSS grid uh we are going to use
26:19 - web flow
26:20 - responsive uh panel to create responsive
26:23 - for mobile one for this page right and
26:26 - uh let's start with that before start uh
26:29 - I want to let you know that I'm using a
26:32 - font called inter here so you have to
26:36 - add your font here in wlow to add a font
26:39 - in wlow uh either you click here or
26:43 - let's say if I click here it says add
26:45 - fonts right I click there it will take
26:48 - me to this website of section of W
26:51 - flow's uh settings page here fonts uh we
26:55 - don't have enter there so let's uh
26:56 - select here just type enter and here
27:01 - let's just uh select some regular fonts
27:03 - 5 6 7 8 I'm just just selecting them it
27:06 - depends on your choices whatever the
27:08 - fonts you are using the font weight you
27:11 - can do that and from there I'll just go
27:14 - to designer again so that I I have a
27:17 - font right so this is my process when
27:19 - I'm building any website so this is how
27:21 - I build I add font first and then export
27:25 - all the images let's say here we have a
27:27 - l logo as a image here we have logos of
27:31 - our clients here we have this image this
27:34 - image blog images I export all of the
27:37 - images and add them first here so that I
27:42 - have everything in place uh just to
27:46 - start building my website right once you
27:50 - have added your phones now here in the
27:54 - style panel click on this body and in
27:57 - the style selector click here so that uh
28:00 - it will show you all these uh classes
28:03 - you have and the pink one is the default
28:05 - class that we FL is providing you right
28:07 - for all the bodies in your website so
28:09 - for all the bodies in my website I want
28:11 - to use a font called enter let's find
28:15 - iner enter is here and
28:18 - uh this is the font size and 24 is the
28:22 - line height I'm using and here I want to
28:24 - use this color uh let let's grab the
28:26 - color from here uh
28:29 - 4950 and this one here you have the
28:33 - color there right so mean this color
28:35 - will apply to all of my uh phones on the
28:39 - website or my body colors um
28:43 - here we have images we have fonts now
28:48 - let's set up these buttons we have two
28:50 - types of buttons small and large small
28:54 - small and I think again large button so
28:57 - let's create button first uh let's
28:59 - create a small button I'll just zoom in
29:01 - here and here I will just uh add
29:08 - button okay simply add a button here
29:11 - before that let me show you uh how to
29:14 - add a container here you you contr e to
29:18 - pull up this find bar and add a section
29:21 - and when section is selected hit CR e
29:25 - again and add a container
29:28 - container this is your container
29:30 - container mean it's a it's a fixed value
29:32 - of your uh viewport right so that is the
29:36 - maximum value your content would be in
29:38 - within right it won't go outside of it
29:41 - until unless you create or you use
29:43 - positions absolutes and fixed and all it
29:46 - depends on that so my container here is
29:51 - has the width of let's me select this
29:54 - 1140 and inside that you have 12
29:58 - 12 paddings given from both sides you
30:02 - can see those blue
30:04 - lines so let's say uh here my
30:08 - container let's say I'll just write uh
30:11 - before I write container let me delete
30:14 - these uh CSS from our previous uh demo
30:19 - let me just clean them up I don't want
30:20 - to use them okay gone okay now here at
30:24 - this container I want to make it
30:26 - container
30:28 - maximum right now maximum with is 940
30:31 - let's make it 1140 so now it's
30:33 - 1140 and
30:36 - uh inside that I'm going to add a button
30:39 - here's my button and let's get the
30:42 - button color from
30:44 - here what is the button color button
30:46 - color is this let's go there and just
30:49 - change the button color here my button
30:51 - color what is the radius of that button
30:55 - radius means the corners of that button
30:57 - is six pixel so I'm just going down here
31:01 - in this radius Border in this border
31:04 - section in on inside radius I'll just
31:06 - write six so from all the sides it will
31:08 - be six and what is the font size of that
31:12 - button is 16 pixel and uh semi bold
31:16 - inter semi bold so I'll just do that uh
31:18 - 16 pixel let's go here 16 pixel 24 semi
31:22 - bold semi bold enter right uh text is
31:26 - like a sign up
31:29 - this is sign up see it looks like
31:32 - that right and uh what else do we have
31:35 - here uh I think we don't have anything
31:38 - else there let's uh set up its line
31:40 - height to 18 or so and what is the Ping
31:46 - 10 10 and 16 16 from both sides let's
31:49 - say from top and bottom 10 ping and 16
31:53 - from the both side
31:58 - right so here our button let's make a
32:00 - large button how to make a large button
32:02 - so let's say you have one button created
32:04 - a class
32:06 - now uh again add another class here say
32:12 - large right large so it's a large button
32:16 - large large button we just have to
32:18 - change uh its pedding and all a pedding
32:21 - is 166 from top bottom and from left and
32:24 - right we have 24
32:26 - 24 so let's say 16 16
32:30 - 16
32:33 - 16 24 and 24 you can use your let's say
32:38 - alt and uh just drag this it will work
32:43 - right but I I mostly prefer to you use
32:46 - keyboard not that drag one because
32:49 - sometimes it doesn't give you perfect
32:50 - one okay so now you have small and large
32:53 - button so large button we have text says
32:56 - try scale for free
32:58 - let me use that okay so this is our
33:00 - small and large buttons here okay so we
33:04 - have our buttons ready these are the
33:06 - classes you can use this class anywhere
33:08 - let's say I am adding a button on a
33:10 - different page and I want to make this
33:13 - button like the smaller one right here
33:15 - the default one is the smaller one so
33:17 - I'll just go here and I'll just add this
33:20 - class button see simple this is uh the
33:23 - use of CSS in wlow the classes that you
33:27 - can easily call and uh give up the style
33:30 - that you have already predefined right
33:32 - so our buttons are ready so let's uh
33:34 - delete them it won't go anywhere just
33:36 - Ting it from the
33:38 - viewport uh here let's use headings here
33:42 - we have to use headings also from for
33:45 - headings I will use uh
33:48 - heading heading one 2 3 4 5 uh let's
33:54 - let's use the six one
33:56 - also so here uh
34:00 - H1 H2 in the setting panel I'm changing
34:03 - all these as you can see you can follow
34:05 - along you can speed it down if you want
34:08 - uh this is H5 I guess yeah H5 and H6 it
34:12 - is also telling you what is the heading
34:14 - uh of these item right the heading
34:16 - you're using H1 H2 H3
34:19 - H4 so by default we are using for
34:21 - heading we are using 48 and the color is
34:24 - black right 48 for the uh sorry medium
34:29 - medium font weight we are using so let's
34:30 - set all the fonts of we
34:33 - have uh here let's go
34:36 - medium uh and uh let's make it black
34:40 - let's not use that
34:42 - black uh for H2 also uh medium and uh
34:49 - black for
34:51 - [Music]
34:55 - H3 black I'll make it medium
35:00 - for here also
35:02 - H4 black I'll make it
35:06 - medium for this one also
35:09 - H5 medium and black
35:14 - H6 H6 medium and uh black now let's go
35:21 - there and what is the font this is our
35:25 - H1 let's say this is our H1 it's 48 and
35:27 - 60 pixel of line height uh 48 let's set
35:32 - this as
35:35 - 48 and 60 for line
35:38 - height uh let's say this is our H2 40
35:42 - and oo let's say 48 we can use 40 let's
35:45 - make it uh
35:48 - 40 40 and
35:51 - 48 uh here we can go and let's say this
35:55 - is our h
35:57 - I think this is our H2
35:59 - again this is our H3 but let's say this
36:02 - is our H3 and uh okay this is also H2 uh
36:06 - this is our
36:09 - H3 H3 let's use this as H3
36:13 - 28 for H3 let's go and use
36:18 - 28 and
36:20 - 36 uh 4 H4 this is our H4 the block
36:25 - Title 20
36:28 - H4 all over H4 will be 20 and uh 28 I'm
36:35 - just using eight here
36:37 - there here it by default gives you these
36:41 - ones you can uh remove them if you want
36:43 - I just want to keep these for
36:46 - now right so now you have your headings
36:49 - your buttons are all set to go right you
36:52 - have your
36:53 - color uh here in the style guide you can
36:57 - see you have everything that you want
36:59 - right 72 that I think we have added this
37:01 - in the last one let me add a color so
37:04 - that I can use it if I need it any
37:08 - anytime just go here and the color is
37:14 - this uh
37:16 - brand color
37:19 - all and uh color of this text is this uh
37:27 - text
37:29 - text text color I'm just giving a name
37:31 - you can give a proper name meaningful
37:34 - name make sure you always name them
37:36 - properly so here we have a section inser
37:39 - container we have headings let me delete
37:42 - all the headings now and
37:48 - uh and let's start uh developing this
37:51 - page uh so I'll try to use the
37:54 - predefined sections given by wlow so I
37:58 - need a heading right I need a header as
38:00 - you can see in the design we have header
38:03 - so for adding a header what I'll do I'll
38:06 - just click here on this Plus in the
38:09 - layouts uh in this one I'll just uh find
38:13 - the header I want I think this matches
38:16 - with my requirements very well this
38:20 - one so I'll just go here and I'll just
38:23 - drag and drop I don't have to do
38:26 - anything else I'll just
38:29 - track here and inside that they might
38:33 - have used the container or something
38:35 - container they already have container
38:36 - let's not use their container let's use
38:39 - our own
38:41 - container so here we have our own
38:43 - container and uh let's not use the these
38:48 - things I think I don't want to use
38:51 - them Let's uh use our own container
38:54 - let's make it auto from margin AO
38:57 - setting Auto means uh it will leave
38:59 - space from let's say if you set auto
39:01 - from both the side mean it will be in
39:03 - the center whatever the content size you
39:05 - have it will be in the
39:07 - center okay so for this one background I
39:10 - want my background to be white I don't
39:13 - want to use any predefined color here
39:15 - let's uh take it as an example here the
39:17 - image I'll just choose my logo
39:20 - here I have my logo what are the links I
39:24 - have home features blog and sign up
39:26 - right
39:32 - home
39:35 - features and block so here we're going
39:39 - to change a few things let me read that
39:43 - this take that and for this one I'm not
39:46 - going to use the primary given I will
39:48 - just use my own button the smaller one I
39:52 - think we had righted get started let's
39:53 - use sign up sign up
39:57 - sign up so this is my button from Top
40:01 - what is the Ping from Top it is 16 let's
40:05 - add a 16 from
40:07 - top 16 from Top ping uh I think that's
40:12 - it see our let's go and see the size of
40:17 - this one 14 pixel regular and this is
40:20 - the color for the that one here enter
40:25 - normal we already have that for all the
40:27 - nail links that will be our color let's
40:28 - say if you want to make it nail link the
40:30 - medium let's make it medium right so
40:33 - this is how you can make it and what is
40:35 - the spacing spacing is like 24 let's add
40:38 - 12 12 from sides right now it is that
40:42 - much I don't want this uh margin there I
40:46 - just want 12 12
40:49 - 12 and 12 means by default it's like 12
40:53 - 12 here I want 24 again but how can do
40:57 - that uh I'll just add uh a class here
41:03 - called M M for margin L for left and
41:08 - hyon let's say 12 because I already have
41:11 - 12 right so I'll just add these and I'll
41:13 - just add margin to LC this is how our
41:17 - would look
41:18 - like uh as part our design that is
41:22 - our header see it's it's easy right it's
41:25 - super fast you can use vlow fore library
41:28 - to create layouts so not every time you
41:31 - have to create these things from scratch
41:33 - because it takes time so you can use
41:35 - these you can clone some items if you if
41:37 - you want to if you want some inspiration
41:40 - you can go to our website and find more
41:42 - inspiration on how how we use components
41:45 - to create uh these layouts
41:48 - faster right so now we have our this
41:52 - ready now we have see this is mobile
41:54 - responsive right we will change this
41:56 - later don't worry about that that uh
41:58 - that that we had now we have a section
42:00 - inside the section uh we have container
42:03 - the one we did earlier so here I want uh
42:07 - in this section I want uh image I want
42:11 - this content with this button and uh
42:14 - let's let's see the the padding we have
42:18 - from Top from this menu we have 80 from
42:20 - top and from these uh logos we have 67
42:25 - right I I I think that's fine because
42:28 - logo uh that image has that opacity down
42:33 - there so let's say here I I'll just
42:35 - choose that section from Top I want to
42:40 - leave 0 and from bottom Also let's say
42:44 - 64 not 67 but 64 now your container will
42:48 - be in the
42:49 - center so here I want to add a du block
42:53 - or you can say let's say here you go uh
42:57 - the
42:57 - elements V Flex right means vertical
43:00 - flex and S Flex means horizontal Flex
43:03 - whatever you will put inside this V Flex
43:06 - it will give you structure like uh this
43:09 - right so let's add a v Flex here inside
43:13 - this container I'm adding a flex block
43:16 - block vertical by default it is vertical
43:18 - so what we had there we had a heading we
43:22 - had a paragraph and uh we had a button
43:27 - right so now it's not looking properly
43:29 - the way we want it right so here in the
43:31 - flax box you see all these properties
43:35 - aligned aligned right now it is aligned
43:37 - to the start wherever you have a box
43:41 - from the start it will align your
43:42 - content what if you align your content
43:44 - to Center if you do Center if you hit
43:48 - center button here your content will be
43:51 - in the
43:52 - center if you hit end then it will start
43:57 - start from the right hand
43:59 - side let's do Center because that is
44:02 - what our requirement is and uh still the
44:06 - content is not in the center properly
44:08 - because this paragraph is going outside
44:10 - right it is starting from the left line
44:13 - so what I'll do I'll just scroll down a
44:15 - bit in the style panel and I'll in in
44:17 - inside this typography I have this align
44:19 - again for the content text I want to
44:23 - make it Center see now it's the now it's
44:25 - in the center so let's go and grab our
44:30 - copy here let's make that uh here I'll
44:34 - show you a Max width how to use a Max
44:36 - width for this content in a while try
44:40 - scale for free here I have a button I
44:42 - have this button should be large right
44:45 - so let's use button and let's use
44:49 - large simple right once you have
44:52 - everything predefined pre-built a style
44:55 - guide then it becomes very easy easier
44:57 - for you to build any layout any pages in
45:01 - wlow whether in framer or V Studio you
45:04 - have to create this style guide make
45:06 - sure you always have a style guide with
45:08 - you so that it's easier for see 2424 we
45:11 - have so here I choose this flax box and
45:14 - the row Gap I have is
45:19 - 24 between all of them right so from
45:22 - these one I just want to remove these uh
45:25 - margins given by default I don't want
45:28 - them because I'm adding manual manually
45:31 - row values the gaps we have for this
45:34 - paragraph also given by default is I
45:37 - don't like this okay so now as you can
45:40 - see here here if you click here on this
45:44 - uh paragraph it says that here in this
45:47 - width one it says
45:49 - 451 right so let's go here to make how
45:52 - you can make it just like we did
45:54 - container how we Auto align them right
45:57 - in the center we can do the same thing
45:58 - here let's say choose your paragraph Max
46:02 - width inside Max withth
46:04 - 451 and uh okay I think we don't have to
46:07 - do that because we are already using
46:09 - flax boox so that it is already setting
46:10 - up your content in the middle okay that
46:13 - was your max width so now if you just uh
46:17 - review this here one

46:34 - ping here also so let me see 99 right
46:38 - okay
46:40 - 99 inside that you
46:45 - have
46:46 - nine and inside that you have nine okay

47:15 - add that image but before that I will
47:17 - let me add that
47:20 - uh V Flex again V Flex again
47:25 - here here again I'll hit contr e and
47:31 - image I'll choose that image from my
47:35 - assets uh let me find that image let me
47:38 - find that image let me find I think this
47:39 - is the image okay this is the image I
47:42 - look was looking for and I will again
47:44 - make it in the center and I I would like
47:49 - to put some ping between the button
47:52 - content and the image 56 as you can see
47:55 - so let me put some ping from top or
47:57 - let's say margin
48:00 - 56 okay so now you have uh nice
48:06 - looking header area hero area whatever
48:09 - you can Sol the fold area right that is
48:14 - built uh with f
48:17 - flow without writing any
48:19 - code right
48:21 - simple uh what else we want to do we
48:25 - want to add this uh logos we want to
48:28 - build these layout
48:31 - also okay now let's start with the logo
48:33 - section so what I'll do now I'll just uh
48:37 - copy paste uh let's not copy paste uh in
48:41 - this one let's let me create another
48:43 - section this section inside that I have
48:46 - a
48:47 - container and container I will always
48:51 - give that container uh style that we
48:54 - have already created so that it stays in
48:56 - the center
48:58 - uh this one has 67 from top and uh one
49:02 - Zer from one bottom but I don't want to
49:05 - add that now because we already have
49:08 - that here I guess 67 64 right so let's
49:12 - create that section as it is by default
49:16 - let me add some pading here so that I
49:19 - have something to create okay I'm just
49:22 - adding I will remove it at the end so
49:24 - don't worry about that
49:27 - okay I have a title so for the title I
49:30 - will use a text block a
49:34 - simple text block and what does that
49:37 - title says join
49:41 - the join 14 position scale and that one
49:45 - is like 16 pixel medium and 24 pixel
49:49 - line height and it is a a case
49:53 - 1624 what was the color color was
49:57 - this one okay let's change its color to
50:00 - this and uh here to make it uh uper case
50:05 - here you have to click on this more type
50:07 - options and select this one for
50:09 - uppercase for this one for your
50:12 - capitalize and for this one for your
50:14 - lower case right this one and I want
50:17 - these in the center and I want to make
50:20 - it like a medium so that I looks like
50:23 - that 1624 see
50:27 - we are building it super fast and now
50:30 - let me use uh again a flax box but a
50:35 - horizontal one I will go down here I
50:38 - will again put it inside that one and I
50:41 - will use all of my Logos the logos I
50:45 - have click
50:48 - that uh image let's say this logo I have
50:52 - here 2 3 4 five I think I have five
50:56 - logos yes second one is Harvest ede cut
51:00 - let's select this
51:02 - Harvest
51:05 - Harvest AG card don't worry about the
51:08 - layout now let's just add the content we
51:10 - have AG card and then we have pastel and
51:15 - Infinity uh pastel and uh
51:20 - infinity let's look for Infinity okay so
51:23 - I have this flax box what I'll do
51:25 - already created horizontal because we
51:27 - have logos in the horizontal way I want
51:30 - them to be in the
51:32 - center okay I don't want them vertically
51:35 - but I want them uh horizontally Center
51:38 - that's why I'm using justify
51:40 - here okay uh I also want them vertically
51:43 - because if you look at some logos there
51:45 - from Top This is large so some logos
51:47 - might be large in terms of height so
51:49 - that's why you have to use these in the
51:52 - center align in the center so that all
51:54 - your logos will be there and here
51:57 - let's add a gap called 48 as you can see
52:01 - we had a column Gap this time we are
52:04 - going to use column because we are
52:05 - working horizontally 48 for Logos 48 of
52:11 - cap there as you can see we have our
52:14 - logo section there and we have a ping
52:16 - from Top it says uh I don't know
52:21 - 32 let's use from top 32
52:27 - okay so now we have our logo here so far
52:31 - we have mostly used flax box right see
52:36 - the power of flax box you just drag and
52:38 - drop things and adjust them as you want
52:42 - and you'll have
52:43 - something uh that is given in your
52:46 - designs by your
52:48 - designer uh here we could have used uh
52:51 - grid also but I don't want to use grid
52:53 - for this simple thing grid can be used
52:55 - for this one and for this one right for
52:58 - large
52:59 - things okay so now we are going to
53:02 - create this section this feature
53:04 - sections and we will link all these
53:06 - sections home features blog later right
53:11 - but uh for now let's build this section
53:13 - we will build it for once and we will
53:16 - use it duplicate this for these two
53:18 - times I'll show you how you can also
53:21 - this uh swap
53:23 - them uh here I have the sections I'll
53:28 - I'll just use this SE I'll just create a
53:30 - new section again section inside that I
53:33 - will add a container always make sure
53:35 - that you have you follow this
53:37 - process uh this
53:41 - section let's give it a name page
53:43 - section the hero one is the different
53:46 - one that's why I'm not taking that one
53:48 - uh here I have the Ping for section is
53:51 - 104 from top and bottom let's use that
53:54 - top and bottom
53:57 - 104 104 inside that I have a container
54:02 - inside that container let's give it a
54:04 - name I have to give it a name
54:07 - container stays there and uh here as you
54:11 - can see we can use a grid a two column
54:14 - grid uh one for the image and one for
54:17 - the content let's add a grid here I'll
54:20 - hit control e type grid so I have grid I
54:24 - just hit enter so I have a grid now
54:27 - inside this I just want only one row and
54:30 - two columns columns I have two columns
54:32 - Row one here there are two rows I don't
54:34 - want them only one row two columns and
54:38 - what is the gap between them what is the
54:40 - gap between them let's use the gap
54:43 - between them 11 19 let's use 120 120
54:48 - of of the gap of that uh four four four
54:52 - rows let's use let's say 40 I think that
54:56 - is good for the mobile
54:57 - one here I
55:02 - have uh I think I think let's not use
55:05 - 120 let's not use let's not use any gap
55:08 - for
55:10 - now let's let's use them later so I will
55:13 - add a du block inside that grid I will
55:16 - copy paste that du block again means I
55:18 - have two du blocks for two columns one
55:21 - for the first one second for the second
55:23 - column so here uh I have the image so I
55:27 - will just uh pull my image and just drag
55:31 - and drop your image you can do that too
55:34 - so this is my image so here I have this
55:36 - image and I can put that image inside my
55:38 - d block I have my image in the second d
55:41 - block for the second column I have
55:45 - heading that is H2 see H2 and uh you
55:50 - have paragraph and uh what else do we
55:53 - have we have a button a small button so
55:55 - that is fine
55:56 - a button here we can use a button class
55:59 - we already have here for the small
56:01 - button heading what is the heading title
56:06 - heading title is
56:08 - that uh what is the
56:11 - paragraph paragraph is
56:14 - that okay okay now we have this H2 let's
56:19 - again uh remove that
56:22 - zero zero I don't want them because I
56:25 - most mostly use flax boox okay so
56:31 - now uh this content is like 15 and
56:38 - 24 so here from this bottom let's add 15
56:42 - or let's say 16 and below this uh
56:46 - paragraph let's say
56:48 - 24 I always change these names I don't
56:52 - keep it like this it's not a good
56:53 - practice always make sure you keep up
56:56 - proper name here this grid right let's
56:59 - say uh it should be like
57:02 - feature features GD means if anyone is
57:06 - working on this project your partner or
57:09 - your team uh teammate right they know
57:12 - what is this grid used for like this
57:14 - heading H2 give a proper name right now
57:17 - I'm just just to show you how this works
57:20 - and all that's why I'm taking all these
57:22 - uh examples learn more text is
57:28 - more so here the content is in the
57:32 - center of the image so how can you do
57:34 - that in CS grid select your D Block on
57:38 - the right hand side panel you see this
57:40 - align to
57:43 - Center so it's in the center now as you
57:47 - can see here so it will be in the
57:50 - center and the Gap we have is like 120
57:55 - that I think we did
57:56 - Also
57:58 - earlier
58:00 - 120 and that's it you have cap of
58:06 - 120 so here what's happening is uh you
58:09 - have this 50% inside this 50% we are
58:12 - just leaving padding from here so I
58:14 - think it is uh creating our section not
58:18 - sure right now uh what can we do
58:22 - here I think it's fine let it be like
58:25 - this for now right in the next one we
58:27 - can do something else uh let let me copy
58:31 - paste this feature grid two times so
58:33 - that we have a layout that we want here
58:36 - in the second one what I'll do is I'll
58:40 - just add a class combo class this is
58:43 - called combo class
58:45 - reverse right reverse and I want to send
58:49 - this in the last one see this is this is
58:53 - how easy it
58:54 - is right so now uh you have your content
59:01 - here so this is how your content will be
59:04 - when whenever you are creating this uh
59:06 - using this grid system in flap
59:09 - flow uh you have your content I know
59:12 - this should be here like this but let
59:15 - let it be like this for now I don't want
59:17 - to add a spacing there
59:21 - um let's see the the gap between two
59:25 - grades 80 pixel let's add for this grid
59:30 - from the bottom
59:32 - add 80 so means all the grids that is
59:37 - using these class features grid will
59:40 - have a margin of 80 pixel but the the
59:43 - last one I don't want so margin bottom
59:47 - zero see I use these uh class names like
59:52 - this so that I know okay I here I'm
59:54 - putting margin bottom or here I'm adding
59:57 - uh margin top for Mt for margin top ml
60:01 - for margin left all those kind of uh
60:03 - namings right for for my understanding
60:06 - how how what what they will do and all
60:09 - so here we have a section ready of
60:11 - feature
60:12 - section and after the features we have
60:15 - this grid section where we have a
60:18 - section title so let's do that uh let's
60:22 - go up here here I will show you another
60:24 - thing the naming thing that I was
60:26 - discussing
60:27 - about here this one let's go here let's
60:31 - delete this great I don't want that here
60:33 - I don't want uh I I don't want to even
60:37 - use this so let it be uh let's dat that
60:42 - so here we already have 104 pixel of
60:46 - pedding here I don't want them from top
60:49 - of my this section so what I'll do from
60:51 - here ping top zero and and I will just
60:56 - make
61:00 - it zero like that so
61:04 - now uh that will be like a in sync right
61:09 - the bottom still has 104 because I have
61:12 - uh this section I'm adding 104 here
61:14 - that's why so here what I have I have a
61:17 - section so I I'll just use
61:21 - again uh V Flex V Flex I'll just type V
61:26 - and I have a flex and uh here let's
61:31 - use a
61:33 - heading here let's add a paragraph for
61:37 - Section title let's use the heading

70:25 - center Center you know this now that I
70:27 - use this align to make it in the center
70:31 - and here you have this content it
70:36 - says encourage
70:39 - fast I'll I'll change the heading style
70:41 - so don't worry
70:43 - now sh
70:48 - call and below this I have a simple text
70:52 - block I can add that
70:55 - I can add that sorry for that can add
70:59 - that uh not required okay okay I'll just
71:04 - do this that okay so this is my I think
71:09 - we are using H2 here so let's use H2
71:12 - here let's make it white okay this
71:15 - one is my white color and this one is
71:19 - also white but little bit off white so
71:22 - I'll just uh use a random color from
71:25 - here and for this one I'm using
71:30 - button button large but I'm using a
71:35 - white button with a black color so
71:38 - button large just add another
71:41 - white here select white for its color go
71:45 - to color select black so now you have
71:47 - your button also like the design and no
71:51 - credit card required is also using this
71:53 - color so let me use this
71:55 - here let's use that here again okay so
72:01 - we have
72:04 - our heading paragraph and all let's use
72:07 - some ping thing
72:10 - 24 24 let's use 24 24 let's use I'm not
72:15 - using a flx box here right the moment
72:18 - let's using
72:19 - 24 right I think this can be 16 for
72:24 - better visibility and for this button
72:26 - for this
72:28 - one okay for this
72:33 - one I don't know why this is clicking
72:36 - two times okay from margin Bottom I want
72:41 - zero zero and from Top let's say 16 or 8
72:48 - okay eight I'm using eight from
72:51 - Top okay so I have my CTF block ready
72:55 - here and
73:00 - uh and what else I have I have this
73:03 - footer so for footer let's look at vlow
73:06 - and see if they already have any footer
73:08 - sections for
73:09 - us uh let's see layouts in the layouts I
73:15 - have this hero F fo footer features
73:20 - testimonials and the Footers we already
73:22 - have but let me see if we can and foter
73:27 - foter dark foter light fo light okay
73:31 - let's use fo light okay I think we have
73:33 - something down here and let's not use
73:36 - the let's use our container let's use
73:38 - our container to match with our brand
73:41 - here we have uh we don't want to use
73:44 - this because we don't have that
73:47 - uh thing there uh here but we can use
73:51 - okay let me use something down here
73:54 - let's use logo let's not use any TX
73:56 - there let's use logo like web flows
74:00 - right and you have links get in touch
74:03 - and app
74:05 - download this links you can change this
74:08 - I I'll just show
74:10 - you get in touch
74:17 - and
74:20 - download so few things we don't have we
74:22 - will remove them links for links uh what
74:24 - what is the font size 16 pixel and the
74:28 - medium with black
74:32 - color
74:33 - medium 16 24 let's make it 24
74:45 - and uh 1624 and
74:50 - regular okay let it be like this let's
74:53 - not use that and let's use our color
74:56 - what was our color 6
75:00 - C that color we had and here's that here
75:05 - okay so I think we have something down
75:10 - here uh
75:12 - [Music]
75:13 - now not going to add these links now let
75:17 - it be like whatever is webflow is
75:18 - providing and let's add this app
75:21 - download I we don't have that right we
75:23 - we will customize whatever are providing
75:25 - we will customize them so here as you
75:29 - can see uh here we have this form block
75:32 - we don't want that form
75:34 - block the last
75:37 - one we don't want that form block what
75:39 - do we want we want uh app
75:43 - download So as you can see it's not
75:45 - properly like what we have on our
75:48 - design so I I'll just change that in a
75:51 - while so here we have link two from Top
75:55 - it is 20 so let me use a link block and
76:00 - inside that let me
76:02 - add this one let's say we have
76:06 - Google we have App
76:10 - Store link okay I'm not pasting them
76:16 - inside okay from 20 we have
76:20 - 20 from Top we have let's say 20
76:28 - uh two link block two if you just write
76:31 - and use the existing names you have here
76:34 - I will
76:36 - use I will use App Store icon okay I
76:40 - think uh we have something that is
76:44 - already there let's we don't have this
76:46 - let let's keep it like this I think it's
76:48 - looking good we don't have anything here
76:50 - but let's keep it like this they have
76:52 - this and footer from bottom they have
76:54 - have this one I don't want that port
76:57 - line top is
76:59 - fine right let's change this to
77:06 - power okay so not looking like this
77:10 - right uh these are on the side and this
77:13 - is on the left hand side let's make it
77:15 - like that so here they are
77:19 - using a flax box and I mostly don't use
77:23 - flax box when it come when it
77:27 - comes uh
77:31 - to let me first
77:34 - use put this here I don't use flex
77:37 - blocks when it comes
77:39 - to footer because Footers I always
77:43 - prefer to use grid CSS grid I want to
77:46 - have let's
77:47 - say
77:50 - uh let's say 1 2 3 4 four column GD
77:53 - right two four and only one row there
77:59 - and here what I'll do now in the grid
78:03 - I'll just uh drag this first one the F
78:07 - I'll just drag this on this side so that
78:10 - let's say 5050 something like that three
78:14 - so now if you look at this and our
78:17 - design it looks little
78:19 - similar so here we have this create all
78:24 - let let me use a heading that we have
78:26 - here also let's not use the logo I don't
78:30 - want the logo because I want it to be
78:32 - like our design here I think we can use
78:36 - H2 or H3 and uh
78:46 - get H3 and uh here we have app after app
78:50 - we have new line so I'll just hit enter
78:55 - shift enter for that in inside that
79:00 - line okay here let's use this zero so
79:03 - that everything is align
79:06 - top I think uh this is how you
79:10 - create in
79:13 - wlow see the design we have I'm keeping
79:17 - this I don't want to remove that one
79:19 - okay let's let's remove that this one we
79:22 - had from there
79:25 - okay so I think this is it uh here our
79:29 - landing page is ready so now let's say
79:31 - let's call it this section let's link
79:33 - them up with this uh inline or on page
79:37 - linking right section linking let's call
79:39 - this section first section and call it
79:42 - hero and the section was this one is
79:46 - like
79:49 - features this one is like uh news
79:55 - this one is like
79:59 - CTA and this is our Foo I think we don't
80:02 - want the footer now so home home click
80:05 - on the home link on this uh right hand
80:07 - side in the section this one is the page
80:10 - section the third one it says pay
80:12 - section I want this to go to the hero I
80:16 - want this to link to my features I want
80:22 - this blog one to link to my news and I
80:27 - want this sign
80:29 - up uh to link to my uh CTA so as you as
80:34 - you just click here let's say home your
80:37 - home your block click block block if you
80:42 - click on sign up it will take you to
80:44 - sign up section so this is how you can
80:46 - link this uh in line one so this one
80:49 - also again I think we can use it for our
80:53 - hero for the home home hero that's it I
80:57 - think uh this is how you create a
81:00 - landing page in wlow I hope you have
81:04 - learned something from this video uh
81:07 - it's we have mostly used flax boox and
81:09 - CSS grid and the style guide that I have
81:12 - created initially uh to create a layout
81:16 - whatever kind of layout that you have in
81:18 - front of you you can easily convert them
81:22 - uh with the system that I just showed
81:24 - you I use this system in all of my
81:27 - clients projects and my own projects hey
81:30 - guys welcome back to this video in the
81:32 - last video we have created a desktop
81:34 - version of our website landing page that
81:38 - uh we are converting from pigo a design
81:41 - tool to wlow website page in this video
81:44 - we are going to make the website page
81:47 - responsive a mobile and tablet
81:49 - responsive and we will also add some
81:51 - animations so that it looks a little
81:54 - inter active right so let me shrink my
81:57 - video
81:58 - here okay so as you can see
82:02 - here uh the page is in desktop to make
82:06 - it responsive uh changes uh click on
82:09 - this tablet version right uh on tablet
82:12 - to me it looks little good uh this is
82:15 - not naar requir some Let's see we add
82:20 - some uh pedding here for NOA let's say
82:23 - 16 from that that and 16 from here on
82:27 - this side so it looks nice and for
82:31 - section for the zero section let's add
82:33 - some ping from 16 from there and 16 from
82:38 - here let's uh let's add padding to our
82:42 - container means uh because we are using
82:44 - the same container everywhere right so
82:46 - let's add padding to our container
82:49 - 16 and 16 from this na bar let's delete
82:53 - it
82:55 - so this is
82:56 - the benefit of using classes right I'm
82:59 - using this container class on every
83:03 - section right and if you are using that
83:07 - one and if you make one change it will
83:09 - affect on everywhere where you have that
83:12 - class and this looks nice to me okay
83:15 - here I think we are we are using but uh
83:17 - this is
83:19 - 100% but let's uh since this is a flax
83:22 - box let's make it uh like like add a
83:26 - wrap wrap means uh if your content is uh
83:29 - overflowing from that flax box right if
83:32 - you add a wrap this wrap then whatever
83:34 - the Overflow content is there it will go
83:37 - to the next row uh here we have these 48
83:42 - let's make it 40 and let's make these 40
83:46 - as well let's not make it 40 and that's
83:48 - uh too big let's
83:50 - 24 and uh I think that that's fine let's
83:53 - let's do to and fit all of them in same
83:57 - Row for these one if if they're allowing
84:01 - h no it's not looking good so let's make
84:03 - it 40 and uh 24
84:06 - row and what else do we have uh this
84:09 - section looks good let's just uh remove
84:12 - padding uh between these uh two columns
84:16 - right now it is 120 let's make it
84:20 - 24 24 is fine see everywhere it will be
84:23 - 24
84:25 - uh what else I think this is fine for
84:28 - now this section is fine for tablet
84:31 - version uh this kind of designs are fine
84:34 - mostly at here I think we have a gap
84:37 - that we had
84:39 - added sure let's check okay 56 let's
84:43 - make it
84:45 - 40 and uh here we have some Gap let's
84:49 - remove that Gap 12 to 24 so that it
84:53 - looks nice
84:55 - nice and uh I think
84:59 - uh here the Gap we can reduce is this
85:04 - one let's make it let's say two to FR so
85:09 - that it fits very well see as you can
85:11 - see it it fits very well here uh this
85:15 - ping I think uh on the on the tablet
85:18 - version it looks nice let's go to the
85:21 - mobile landscape uh here it looks nice
85:23 - again this part uh this part let's try
85:27 - to reduce this piece and fit them well
85:30 - okay now I think's fine 16 16 is too
85:35 - much 8 8 is fine I think this is looking
85:38 - fine to me okay now so for this one I
85:43 - think we need one column here because uh
85:45 - it's not looking good here so I'll just
85:47 - click here on this grid I'll come to
85:49 - these columns I'll just delete a column
85:52 - from here if I delete anything here
85:54 - it won't affect here or here on this
85:58 - desktop or tablet if I make any change
86:00 - on the mobile side it won't effect on
86:03 - your uh bigger versions bigger devices
86:06 - right it will only affect to the smaller
86:08 - versions if I make any change on the
86:10 - landscape the only changes will be
86:12 - affect to landscape and the mobile
86:14 - version if you look at here only that
86:16 - one not the bigger one uh keep that in
86:19 - mind here we have page section 80 I I I
86:23 - want 64 or something let's say 64 for
86:27 - top and
86:28 - bottom uh okay I think we did uh
86:31 - something like we had changed this one
86:34 - right I think image we did so image here
86:38 - earlier it
86:40 - was set to let's set it first so let's
86:44 - say we have image then content image and
86:46 - content for features section and after
86:50 - the fature grid we have 80 pixel off
86:53 - let's make it 40 or let's make it 60 a
86:56 - little bit less and uh and okay this one
87:01 - click on the grid we have click on the
87:03 - grid I want only one
87:06 - column grade here with the cap of 32
87:11 - because that that is perfect now I think
87:15 - right and here I want uh single column
87:19 - grid
87:21 - again and
87:25 - and yep and for this one I think it's
87:29 - it's fine 8080 let's make it uh 60
87:34 - 60 I think this is fine and for this one
87:39 - let's not go like this let's make it one
87:41 - column also one one one and this is like
87:47 - one
87:48 - column and all the footer will be like
87:52 - this all of your fooo will be like this
87:54 - now I think this is fine to
87:58 - me uh Gap what what is the gap we have
88:02 - here what do we G 80 let's not make it
88:05 - 80 let's make it 60 so uh we don't have
88:09 - lots of wide space there let's make it
88:12 - 48 and I think to me it looks good and
88:15 - do we have any space from Top yes let's
88:18 - delete that 16 I think this is fine
88:20 - perfect see in just 5 minutes I think
88:24 - right uh we are almost done with our
88:28 - responsive page uh this text is Big
88:31 - let's make it smaller let's make it 40
88:34 - or something let's make it uh 40 and 48
88:39 - I think this is fine but I I don't like
88:41 - these uh one so let's make it 36 36 is
88:45 - good 36 and 44 it's fine what what is
88:50 - the gap we have on both this one or gold
88:53 - button after the okay we had uh this one
88:57 - so let's say we make it 16 so I think it
89:00 - looks perfect now the image you have all
89:04 - these uh logos you can change the logos
89:07 - if you want you can use grid here to
89:10 - show them only one or two columns here I
89:14 - think these are fine for now I think we
89:16 - don't want to change
89:18 - them I want to change them
89:21 - here uh these heading I think it's not
89:24 - looking good it's it's too big let's
89:26 - make it uh 32 or something okay 32 and
89:30 - 40 of line
89:32 - height and I think to me it looks good
89:35 - uh what
89:38 - is8 let's make it 8 and this is fine 24
89:42 - let's make it 16 so wherever we have
89:45 - these classes it will take that one and
89:48 - uh I think uh yes uh this is looking
89:52 - good so here our
89:54 - uh landing
89:56 - page Gap and uh what Gap do we have here
90:01 - let's we have 40 let's make it zero so
90:04 - that we have
90:05 - enough Gap and uh let's select the grid
90:10 - again and let's make it 32 so that uh
90:12 - they have enough space between those
90:15 - sections and we had this fin link and
90:19 - let's make it like a 16 or
90:22 - so uh uh from 80 let's make it 60 and
90:27 - from bottom is fine to me for now okay
90:30 - so this is
90:32 - your responsive landing
90:35 - page Mobile tablet and it fits very well
90:39 - on your that one mobile
90:42 - size okay now let's add some animations
90:46 - quickly so whenever uh my page loads
90:49 - right when these sections comes into
90:52 - view I want to add animations like for
90:55 - this flax box click on these
90:58 - interactions here click on this element
91:00 - trigger I want to do scroll into view
91:04 - here here you can use page load
91:06 - animations and all those are Advanced
91:08 - things you can check out my YouTube
91:10 - channel for more videos on that one I
91:12 - want to use slide I want content to come
91:15 - from the left hand side uh with let's
91:18 - say a delay of 100 or so and for the
91:23 - image I want my image to come
91:27 - from when go to view come from slide
91:30 - come from the right hand side and 100
91:34 - 100 again just just have a look see a
91:37 - smooth animations right uh it's not uh
91:41 - Advanced animations it's just the B
91:43 - basic animations that you see on most of
91:45 - the websites and I think these are these
91:47 - animations are good for page loads right
91:50 - uh it won't uh take too much of your
91:53 - time to load your pages when you are
91:56 - applying for Google uh speed uh
92:00 - score that one this one I want this to
92:04 - come from
92:05 - the uh let's say that one was um let's
92:09 - say let's grow this when when it visits
92:12 - 15 uh offset is 15 means uh 15% when 15%
92:17 - is passed then it will work like this
92:21 - see animations like that and for this
92:25 - one let's use again that the same
92:28 - animation slide in from left I mostly
92:32 - use
92:33 - 10
92:35 - 100 here again the same animation but I
92:39 - will change the the flow from right side
92:45 - 10 and
92:48 - 100 and here the same thing we used for
92:54 - for the first
92:56 - one when this Scrolls into view I want
92:59 - it to come from the left hand side
93:02 - 10 and 100 let's preview the animations
93:07 - now just check out these animations see
93:10 - how easy it is to create animations in
93:13 - wflow again this one uh let's uh if you
93:17 - want to add you can add that scroll into
93:20 - view slide bottom let's not use bottom
93:24 - let's
93:25 - use let's let's use something else let's
93:28 - use feding right
93:31 - 10
93:33 - 100 feding animation and uh for all
93:37 - these one let's use for this
93:40 - collection to make a scroll into
93:43 - view slide from
93:47 - bottom that and
93:50 - uh this is how I use animations in flow
93:54 - so for this one Let's uh make it more
93:56 - interactive for the select a d block the
93:59 - column inside the column we have a d
94:00 - block select that one and scroll into
94:03 - view slide I want it to come
94:07 - from the right side and for this
94:13 - one I want it to come from the left hand
94:18 - side okay now just have a look
94:23 - see uh both will like it will come from
94:26 - the opposite
94:29 - sides so I think it's good and uh again
94:33 - for this
94:34 - [Music]
94:37 - one let's not let's add this animation
94:41 - for the whole footer uh whole footer
94:44 - animation scroll into view I want it to
94:47 - come from the
94:50 - bottom 10 and 100
94:56 - just check out the animations we just
94:58 - added in 5 minutes in 5 minutes we have
95:01 - added cool animations or scroll
95:04 - animations when something comes into
95:06 - view and that that part interacts right
95:10 - as that smoothly comes into your
95:14 - page so what else uh I think I think
95:17 - that's it and uh the second thing I want
95:20 - to talk about is the how animations for
95:23 - this buttons right now nothing happens
95:26 - right when you hover on these one so
95:27 - let's do that let's select this our main
95:30 - button uh here we have large uh for
95:33 - temporary I will
95:35 - just let's look for the small button we
95:39 - have here we have a
95:41 - button click here in the style panel on
95:45 - this drop down and select hover when
95:48 - someone hovers on my website what do I
95:50 - want to do I want to change my buttons
