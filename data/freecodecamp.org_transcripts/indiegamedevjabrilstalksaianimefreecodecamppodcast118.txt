00:40 - welcome back to the free Coke Camp
00:42 - podcast I'm Quincy Larson teacher and
00:44 - founder of free Coke camp.org each week
00:47 - we're bringing you Insight from
00:48 - developers Founders and ambitious people
00:51 - getting into Tech this week we're joined
00:54 - by jabril jabril is building a
00:57 - turn-based fighting game called Ultra
01:00 - bouts and he's developed a ton of games
01:03 - over the years which he's featured on
01:05 - his very popular YouTube channel all
01:08 - about game development got lots of links
01:10 - to cool stuff that he's built over the
01:12 - years that you can check out but first
01:14 - jabil how's it going man Quincy thanks
01:17 - for having me man thanks for the intro
01:19 - that was such a great intro thanks yeah
01:21 - I just I rehearsed when I told you
01:23 - earlier I just rehearse when I'm like
01:25 - walking back from dropping my kids off
01:26 - at school like just kind of yeah any
01:29 - anyway yeah I'm thrilled to have you
01:31 - here man cuz like I've just enjoyed so
01:33 - much like uh watching your video lat I
01:37 - always watch it late at night because
01:38 - it's so entertaining and you I find you
01:40 - like laugh twice as hard at things when
01:42 - it's like a little bit after bedtime so
01:45 - uh yeah man like I was just watching
01:47 - like for example the fake Shark Tank
01:49 - Episode generator tool that you created
01:52 - that that creates the the scripts from
01:54 - like uh Shark Tank and like they're very
01:57 - absurd product ideas but like you know
01:59 - it feels just like an actual Shark Tank
02:01 - Episode in terms of the absurdity of the
02:04 - show which is if anybody spent a lot of
02:06 - time in business you know that the show
02:07 - is pretty divorced from reality in terms
02:10 - of how business deals actually go down
02:12 - but that's that's part of the fun of it
02:13 - right it's reality television which is
02:15 - really hyperreal television yeah yeah so
02:19 - anyway I'm sorry to like ramble right
02:20 - off the bat man but it's great to have
02:22 - you here yeah it's great to be here man
02:24 - I'm excited to talk about all things
02:25 - code and development and Game Dev and
02:28 - let's get into it awesome and I just
02:31 - want to point out also jabril uh
02:33 - contributor to the freeo camp Community
02:35 - you can check out his
02:37 - 5our introduction to programming course
02:40 - it's very flavorful and it's very
02:42 - different from like kind of like the
02:43 - more straight lace course that I would
02:44 - develop if I were creating of course
02:46 - it's you just have all these different
02:48 - kind of like visual gags and other
02:50 - things you do to like really engage and
02:52 - help people retain everything so like
02:55 - yeah I'm going to link to that as well
02:57 - in the show notes be sure to check that
02:58 - out after you finish listening to this

03:42 - devs who are in the field building
03:45 - projects getting players play testing
03:47 - refining and continuing to extend their
03:50 - library of awesome interactive
03:52 - experiences for people interactive art
03:54 - really um so yeah jail I just want to go
03:58 - way back I always like to start with
04:00 - childhood like tell us about little jbr
04:04 - tell us about like your early formative
04:05 - years and how you got into Game
04:08 - Dev yeah let's go back uh before I do
04:12 - that I want to give a shout outs to you
04:13 - guys over at free code Camp love what
04:15 - you guys are doing keep it up um so
04:18 - let's let's go back I think it's it's
04:19 - probably best that I start with um I was
04:23 - I think 9 years old I was living in
04:25 - Virginia at the time my father's in the
04:26 - military so I've been around the coast
04:28 - of the United States
04:30 - and I played a lot of video games when I
04:33 - was growing up actually I should take it
04:34 - back back back when I was I think four I
04:36 - think it was my mom used to play a lot
04:38 - of video games on the Super Nintendo and
04:40 - she used to play uh Donkey Kong Country
04:43 - and I would watch her play this game and
04:45 - I was just so amazed because she had a
04:48 - control in her hand right and she's
04:49 - controlling Donkey Kong but there's
04:51 - other agents on screen and as a young
04:54 - kid I'm like who who's controlling the
04:56 - agents who's controlling the other ones
04:58 - right and so I've always had a FAS but
05:00 - it wasn't until I was about 9 years old
05:01 - when I was introduced to the first Smash
05:03 - Bros on Nintendo 64 and I don't know
05:06 - what it is about that project that game
05:08 - it just like got my game development bug
05:12 - like just running and I will never
05:14 - forget we moved from Virginia to
05:17 - California and I had a notepad and the
05:19 - entire time I'm just like designing
05:21 - levels that I would do if I was the
05:23 - developer for Smash Bros um and then
05:26 - fast forward to I think it was like I
05:28 - was 14 and I got an advertisement for
05:31 - this thing called Game Maker it's like
05:33 - you can code you can code you can make
05:36 - games without coding what the ad and I
05:37 - was like no way Mom can you buy this for
05:39 - me and she was like well if you do your
05:42 - chores for a week straight I'll buy it
05:43 - for you you dang right I did my chores
05:46 - for we week straight she bought it for
05:48 - me and that was the last time I got a
05:49 - full night's sleep wow yeah so you
05:53 - pretty early on you were like I love
05:55 - games I I'll tell you a little anecdote
05:57 - about Smash Brothers when it came out
05:59 - like of course I was like a big N64 like
06:02 - like I had N64 actually had four
06:04 - controllers cuz I loved couch co-op
06:06 - games as as they're called now you call
06:08 - it couch Co-op because you're actually
06:09 - playing in the room with other people
06:11 - unlike most you know online games today
06:14 - uh and I remember like that was such a
06:16 - game changer it was so imaginative I
06:18 - just I couldn't believe the absurdity
06:19 - like wow I can actually go up as Donkey
06:23 - Kong and punch Mario in the face like
06:26 - and knock him off the level and even
06:28 - like the the actual intro stuff kind of
06:30 - like like the final boss is like hands
06:32 - and it it really evokes kind of like a
06:33 - childlike play like you're actually like
06:36 - you pick up your action figures as a kid
06:38 - and you'd have He-Man and Skeletor fist
06:40 - fight and stuff like twisting him around
06:42 - and stuff and and that kind of it had
06:44 - that that Vibe of like I'm just a kid
06:47 - who's hanging out on a summer day and
06:48 - playing with my action figures yeah such
06:51 - a cool game yeah it's an amazing game
06:54 - huge competitive uh scene around that
06:57 - game too which I never would have
06:58 - imagined like people getting so good at
07:00 - it they dedicate like years to getting
07:02 - really good at playing Princess Peach in
07:03 - Smash Brothers Melee like a specific
07:05 - character in a specific game but it's a
07:07 - Legendary game you know it's Legendary
07:10 - game yeah so okay so you get game maker
07:14 - your your mom gets it for you after
07:15 - being a really good kid for a week I
07:18 - don't know about all that but uh I did
07:20 - my choice what what what were the first
07:22 - few days like uh when you had game maker
07:26 - like what were the first things you
07:28 - experimented with okay man so it was
07:31 - Game Maker 5 and they had a bunch of
07:34 - examples I'll never forget it it was
07:35 - like a I forget what the actual game is
07:38 - but it was like a plane game 2D plane
07:40 - game and it was like an example project
07:43 - and then they showed you how to like
07:44 - shoot bullets how to control the plane
07:46 - move left and right how to spawn enemies
07:49 - and I just spent so many hours trying to
07:52 - understand like what every little
07:53 - component was doing and all the examples
07:55 - that they had I think they had just
07:58 - converted over to mark in game maker as
08:00 - a something you can make games without
08:02 - coding so like a drag and drop system
08:04 - like really early days and I did the
08:08 - best I could to understood like the
08:09 - logic that was going on and then I made
08:11 - my first project was was like a a pong
08:13 - remix if you will uh I can send you an
08:16 - image of that I still have images of it
08:18 - yeah and it it was terrible it was an
08:21 - absolutely terrible game uh I did not
08:24 - understand physics but I did the best I
08:26 - could uh but I shipped it so that's
08:30 - that's pretty important and then I just
08:32 - kept on I and then I learned about the
08:34 - forums I learned about the game maker
08:36 - forums which was like so important to my
08:40 - learning on how to use Game Maker
08:42 - because all of a sudden I had this
08:43 - resource to all these people that
08:45 - haven't doing it for years and I ask
08:46 - them questions they will answer it and
08:48 - yeah yeah so getting hooked up with
08:52 - other game developers like did you find
08:54 - that that like was a huge motivational
08:56 - shot in the arm in terms of like I'm
08:58 - actually showing off to people that I'm
08:59 - interacting with did you feel like you
09:01 - found your So-Cal you know your tribe so
09:04 - to speak yeah yeah 100% And I think one
09:07 - thing that's easy to miss from back in
09:10 - the days is that distribution of games
09:13 - was not it was not a thing like you were
09:15 - making games for yourself and maybe 10
09:18 - other people in a forum thread that's
09:20 - about it so back then like you had to do
09:22 - it for the love of it and I think that
09:24 - having discovered the Forum it really
09:27 - helped keep that love alive you know
09:31 - yeah I mean did you build any games that
09:33 - you just like kept to yourself like this
09:34 - is my game like I just want to like I'm
09:37 - the only person who's ever played this
09:39 - this game kind of like a lot of
09:41 - musicians they like hoard like their
09:42 - best work just for themselves to enjoy
09:46 - there were a few projects where that was
09:47 - the case but I I wouldn't say I put like
09:49 - all my time energy into it um the ones
09:53 - where I put a lot of time energy I
09:54 - wanted as many people to play as
09:55 - possible but again back in those days
09:57 - like you're talking 20 down it's like oh
10:00 - my God yes I can't believe this yeah but
10:03 - there there was one project in
10:04 - particular I'll never forget that I made
10:06 - with my brother and sister and it was
10:09 - you you had to like race to the
10:11 - helicopter it was like a three-player
10:13 - game we had to split the keyboard into
10:15 - three different controls through like it
10:17 - was was arrows and something else and we
10:19 - just shared a keyboard but it was so fun
10:21 - to you know be able to put our
10:23 - imagination you know into an app it was
10:26 - a good time do you play with you said Lo
10:29 - WD just for anybody who hasn't gamed
10:32 - recently like that's those are the keys
10:34 - that I guess
10:35 - customarily uh people playing like
10:37 - Counter Strike and stuff will use but I
10:39 - actually use esdf because it gives my
10:42 - pinky like access to more buttons for
10:44 - like switching weapons and stuff so and
10:46 - I I know uh I learned about this from
10:48 - Gabe Newell founder of steam uh or of uh
10:52 - valve uh now the steam company instead
10:54 - of making games they just have a game
10:56 - platform they do occasionally put out
10:58 - games but uh but yeah he he's like a
11:01 - esdf player instead of a wd player how
11:05 - do you what do you have any particular
11:07 - since we're on the topic like do you
11:08 - have any particular like control scheme
11:10 - quirks that you think are unique to
11:13 - you uh I don't think so honestly these
11:17 - days I if it's not a Gamepad I don't
11:19 - know if I can play
11:21 - it okay yeah so so even like for PC
11:24 - games and stuff you like plug a
11:25 - PlayStation controller in or something
11:27 - like that I'm a I'm a huge Gamepad buff
11:30 - I have so many game pads like weird ones
11:33 - and all types of unique ones so yeah I
11:35 - have a bunch of ones that will fit the
11:36 - best need for whatever the game is if
11:38 - they support it of course awesome yeah
11:40 - do you ever get like like the steering
11:42 - wheel type game like or like the flight
11:44 - stick do you do any games like that I
11:47 - wish that I had time to invest in stuff
11:49 - like that I my dad had one when I was
11:51 - younger and it was pretty fun but now
11:53 - days I I don't have like an hour block
11:54 - to just dedicate to that unfortunately
11:56 - so it's not worth the investment well
11:58 - you're you're focused on getting getting
11:59 - things done and making games not just
12:00 - playing games right so um so before we
12:03 - get into like full-blown game
12:05 - development I do want to learn a little
12:06 - bit more like so you went from the
12:08 - forums was there like a particular like
12:10 - Apo in game development where you're
12:13 - just focusing on that very small
12:15 - audience of people on the same thread on
12:17 - a forum like hey I've been working on
12:18 - this game here's the latest build you
12:20 - know stuff like that was there was there
12:22 - a transition period where you started
12:25 - making games for like a broader audience
12:27 - and do you remember what that Reflection
12:29 - Point
12:31 - was um H that's a great question
12:35 - honestly I don't think that really
12:36 - happened until I started the YouTube
12:38 - channel yeah now there was like a a
12:41 - rudimentary form of that so on the
12:44 - forums I I don't know how many active
12:45 - people there were I'd say probably a
12:47 - hundred people were active you know a
12:49 - given month any given month and if when
12:51 - you got good enough in the community you
12:55 - could have a a thread post that you
12:58 - would update like your game is doing and
13:00 - people would chime in they would play it
13:01 - and give you feedback but it required a
13:03 - certain level of skill and I remember I
13:05 - hit that I hit that threshold for like
13:07 - one or two of my projects but by that
13:09 - time I was you know transitioning out of
13:12 - game maker and getting into like you
13:14 - know High School sports and going to
13:16 - college prep and all that stuff you know
13:17 - so so a lot of people's passions are
13:21 - derailed by high school and like the
13:23 - kind of high school metag game so to
13:25 - speak like oh I've got to be were you
13:28 - were you like a popular kid at school or
13:29 - like how would you describe your high
13:31 - school
13:32 - experience I wouldn't say I was popular
13:35 - in the sense that like a lot of people
13:37 - correlate like the popular kid too I got
13:39 - along with everyone so I I guess I was
13:41 - popular in that sense but no I wasn't I
13:43 - definitely wasn't the popular kid and
13:45 - and it's interesting the school that I
13:46 - went to I I was definitely in the closet
13:50 - about making games I didn't tell anyone
13:53 - just due to the school that I went to
13:54 - like no one cared about it and it was
13:57 - kind of nerdy if you will back then so I
13:59 - wasn't trying to get stuffed in the
14:02 - locker you know yeah have you like so
14:05 - this is just like an observation like I
14:07 - I saw this interesting video essay you
14:09 - know I watch lot lot of video essays on
14:11 - YouTube uh and it was about like how
14:14 - like nerdy and geeky and like these
14:16 - terms have kind of like almost fallen
14:17 - out of use because like everybody's a
14:20 - Star Wars fan now or you know uh you
14:23 - know a Lord of the Rings fan or
14:24 - something like there there's not really
14:25 - a stigma associated with using computers
14:29 - like there used to be I mean have you
14:30 - observed that
14:32 - like I mean do you ever feel like what
14:34 - you're doing is quotequote nerdy anymore
14:36 - when you're like you know making these
14:39 - very you know artial games that are very
14:42 - esoteric and like probably a very small
14:44 - subset of Gamers let alone people at
14:47 - large would be interested in playing
14:49 - these
14:50 - games yeah the so nerves are definitely
14:53 - in Vogue now and I think about this
14:55 - quite often it's hard to unpair my
14:57 - experiences as a nerve as a kid right
15:00 - from you know the the man that I am
15:02 - today but uh it's so I think it's so
15:06 - beautiful that there are so many people
15:08 - that I can reach out to and have
15:10 - conversations about code about game
15:12 - development about apps because I
15:14 - remember when I was starting out it was
15:15 - nearly impossible to find anyone to talk
15:18 - about this stuff with like I was lucky
15:20 - that my mom had a friend that knew
15:22 - someone that had a software development
15:24 - job and when I asked him for advice he
15:26 - just gave me Visual Studio 20 for
15:29 - something like that he just gave it to
15:30 - me and it was like good luck like that
15:32 - was all I had and I remember trying I
15:35 - tried to install it and I was like I
15:36 - have no idea what this is and I just
15:37 - never touch it again um but yeah I think
15:40 - it's so beautiful that you know nowadays
15:43 - you can talk to literally anyone about
15:44 - code and they'll have some idea and I
15:46 - think it's just due to the prevalence of
15:47 - how important you you know code is and
15:50 - how prevalent it is in our society
15:51 - nowadays you
15:53 - know yeah 100% like I've definitely
15:55 - found that like when I'm at a dinner
15:57 - party or something uh it used to be like
15:59 - even 10 years ago I'd be like oh yeah
16:01 - I'm a software developer and people
16:02 - would be like oh okay cool and the
16:04 - conversation would just move in move on
16:05 - but now people are like oh cool like um
16:08 - I'm working on this app you know or like
16:11 - I've been doing some python on the
16:13 - weekend and stuff like that and like
16:14 - suddenly like it just seems like the
16:16 - number of people who are interested in
16:18 - learning programming has skyrocketed and
16:21 - that any like uh there there's kind of
16:23 - like there used to be that like oh it's
16:25 - for smart people type talk but I don't
16:26 - really hear that anymore when I talk to
16:28 - people
16:29 - it could be that just like the crowd I'm
16:31 - rolling with is a little older now um
16:33 - because I'm older so like when I go talk
16:36 - to people they're often in their 30s and
16:38 - 40s like I am you know uh as opposed to
16:40 - like younger kids when I was a kid like
16:43 - people were like not very sure of
16:45 - themselves and they would often like
16:47 - limit themselves but you know as you
16:49 - grow older you start to realize oh like
16:51 - these limits are artificial you know
16:52 - like there's nothing stopping an
16:54 - accountant from getting really good at
16:56 - coding right um I did you I think it's
17:00 - more than that though well I I I think
17:03 - it's a bit more than that I think that
17:05 - you know just relating to my experiences
17:07 - when I was a kid the accessibility to
17:10 - these things were so hard to get to
17:12 - right but we have things like free code
17:14 - camp for example right where if I want
17:16 - to learn something I just go to free
17:17 - code camp and you guys have all these
17:19 - resources for me to learn how to do
17:20 - these things right and this is something
17:22 - that we have to thank the modern era for
17:25 - you know uh you you know you take game
17:28 - maker for example I'm so happy that they
17:30 - decided to do a drag and drop system
17:32 - because without that I don't know if I
17:34 - would have I don't know how long it
17:35 - would have took me to discover code you
17:37 - know but that was a good entry point for
17:39 - me to say like hey this looks like
17:41 - something I can do you know you're
17:43 - you're telling me I don't need to code
17:45 - but little did I know it was a stepping
17:47 - stone to the actual code because there's
17:48 - limits to what you can do with the
17:50 - dragon drop but the point I'm trying to
17:52 - make is that I think just things have
17:53 - got a lot more accessible in the Modern
17:55 - Age and it has really enabled so many
17:57 - people to be able to learn to code or
18:00 - just simply know more about what it
18:02 - takes to code or be a coder you know
18:04 - yeah absolutely well uh I'm really
18:06 - interested in like understanding kind of
18:09 - the tools that your tool progression
18:11 - because you said that uh you had like
18:13 - some some friend who gave you visual
18:15 - Studios which is a gigantic very
18:17 - complicated piece of software right like
18:19 - that's like an industri at 15 yeah so
18:23 - you that's like giving somebody the
18:24 - master sword right when they walk into
18:25 - the cave instead of like you know stair
18:28 - stepping them up through like some sort
18:29 - of like leveling progression right uh so
18:33 - what what did you do you're like you put
18:35 - that down did you just go back to game
18:36 - maker like what what tools did you get
18:38 - into do you remember the sequence of
18:40 - tools you progressed through well funny
18:43 - enough the the I got Visual Studio
18:45 - before I even knew game maker existed so
18:49 - I knew that I wanted to make games but I
18:51 - didn't know how it it like I cannot
18:55 - explain how my understanding of making
18:58 - games
19:00 - was like how how difficult it was for me
19:02 - to to grasp the concept of making a game
19:06 - how do you use a computer to render
19:08 - Graphics to render logic Etc I I can't
19:11 - explain to you like how difficult trying
19:13 - to imagine that was um and so yeah the
19:17 - first I asked my mom and she had the
19:19 - friend he gave me Visual Studio I was
19:20 - like here you go this is how you code
19:22 - good luck that was all he gave me I
19:25 - tried to install it I tried to install
19:27 - it didn't work thankfully like a year or
19:29 - two later I discovered game maker uh and
19:31 - they did game maker for like four years
19:33 - I think it was something like that and
19:35 - then I found Unity soon after that and
19:38 - tell us about Unity just like for people
19:41 - that are uninitiated like why is Unity
19:43 - different from you know like n SDK for
19:45 - developing on like PlayStation or
19:47 - something like that right yeah Unity it
19:51 - just provides so many things for you it
19:53 - makes like developing games so easy uh
19:56 - they do graphics for you they do physics
19:58 - for you they do um different like pathf
20:01 - finding logic they do so many things for
20:03 - you right out the box that you don't
20:05 - have to think about the hard stuff you
20:06 - can just get started making some type of
20:08 - game and then in the process of making
20:11 - your game using their their out of
20:13 - thebox tools you learn how to like use
20:16 - those tools more proe over time and that
20:18 - was really instrumental for me I I'll
20:20 - never forget when I first started Unity
20:22 - that using Unity was the first time I
20:24 - ever made a 3D game it was always my
20:26 - goal to make 3D games but having done 2D
20:29 - for so long I thought it was like such
20:31 - an impossible task but in the first I
20:35 - think week of using
20:37 - Unity so much of what I learned with
20:41 - game maker not to mention game maker has
20:43 - their own coding language as well so
20:45 - that was another thing that was like oh
20:46 - I'm not a real coder I'm using gameer
20:48 - language yeah exactly it's like I'm not
20:50 - really coding I'm using scratch or I'm
20:52 - using some simplified for but it really
20:54 - is still coding I think people kind of
20:56 - like talk themselves out of like like
20:59 - you know acknowledging what their their
21:01 - accomplishments they they kind of like
21:03 - denigrate their accomplishments oh I'm
21:05 - just using the training wheels
21:06 - equivalent but it's still coding right
21:08 - yeah yeah 100% And so I'm using Game
21:11 - Maker language and I'm like I'm not a
21:12 - real coder because I'm using their
21:14 - little subset language right but then I
21:16 - start to uh develop games in unity I was
21:19 - like why not right and I was like wait a
21:21 - second this is C this is this is a this
21:24 - is a big boy language I know what a for
21:26 - Loop is I know what an if statement is I
21:28 - I know what a wild Loop is like hold on
21:30 - I know all these Concepts and like it
21:32 - was so easy to transfer from game maker
21:34 - language to C and then from there C to
21:37 - Python and then yeah it as long as you
21:40 - learn the basics I don't no matter what
21:42 - the language is like coding is so easy
21:44 - to transfer the skills over yeah
21:46 - absolutely like at the at the end of the
21:48 - day it's like the same basic like data
21:51 - structure and algorithm Concepts that
21:53 - have been around since Allan Turing
21:55 - right maybe maybe like a few were
21:57 - refined by subsequent generations of
22:00 - computer scientists and then you're just
22:02 - applying math that has been known all
22:04 - the way back to like aisi back and like
22:07 - yeah you the ancient uh you know Indian
22:09 - civilizations and Babylonian
22:10 - civilizations and stuff right like
22:12 - there's nothing new Under the Sun except
22:15 - layers of extraction that make it easier
22:17 - and will continue to make it gradually
22:19 - easier and easier and and we'll
22:21 - definitely talk about that in a little
22:22 - bit but I what were you doing now you
22:24 - can make a 3D game right it's not some
22:27 - pipe dream it's it's something you
22:29 - actually did within the first week of
22:31 - using these tools yeah like what was
22:34 - that like a honeymoon phas for you were
22:35 - you like walking on air knowing like wow
22:37 - I'm actually doing it yeah I was
22:40 - incredibly proud I I believe the first s
22:43 - game I made was a game Jam uh it's still
22:45 - up somewhere it's called
22:48 - super hay stack finder or something that
22:51 - super stack finder finding a needle in a
22:53 - Hast stack or something like that that's
22:54 - yeah that's the concept so you're
22:56 - jumping platform to platform you're
22:57 - looking for a little a cookie for some
22:59 - reason um so that was the first project
23:02 - I did and I was like there's no way like
23:04 - this was so easy you just add one extra
23:06 - Dimension and it's not that difficult
23:08 - and then from there I made my first app
23:10 - that I launched on the Google Play Store
23:12 - it's called Pizza jump still up to this
23:14 - day and I was so proud of that game I
23:16 - was so proud uh and then from there like
23:19 - the sky was the limit I was unlocked I
23:21 - was Unleashed like I I I will I never
23:24 - will forget that after that project that
23:27 - was when I really realized that like
23:29 - there are no limits I can do anything I
23:31 - can do anything and then from there I
23:35 - got into python which I want to say
23:37 - really
23:38 - quick there's one piece of advice that I
23:40 - have for anyone who especially like
23:43 - starting to develop no matter what
23:45 - language it
23:47 - is be very careful listening to some
23:49 - people who try to give you advice on
23:51 - like what language is good or bad or not
23:53 - because there were so many people that
23:54 - telling me that python is not a useful
23:57 - language and it's it's for beginners and
24:00 - it's not a good language but python is
24:03 - so powerful like when I started to code
24:06 - in Python and how simple it was to do
24:08 - certain Concepts comparative to to C I
24:11 - was like what are you guys talking about
24:13 - this thing is amazing and then obviously
24:14 - you got all this support and you can do
24:16 - Ai and artificial intelligence learning
24:18 - it but yeah there just so many lessons
24:21 - that are coming to me at at such a short
24:23 - period of time that I'll never forget so
24:26 - it's almost like uh like a lot of the
24:28 - kind of Mythos around game development
24:30 - is melting away and you're seeing like
24:32 - the actual day-to-day of game
24:35 - development the Practical considerations
24:36 - how do I get distribution for my game
24:38 - how do I um come up with interesting
24:40 - ideas that are going to be fun how can I
24:42 - recombine these different game
24:44 - development Concepts and tropes that
24:46 - have been pioneered through like the 70s
24:49 - 80s 90s like how can I recombine those
24:51 - into interesting games right I I don't
24:53 - mean to be putting too many words in
24:55 - your mouth but that's I imagine you're
24:57 - probably going through something like
24:58 - that as a kid who's just built their
25:00 - first game using
25:04 - Unity yeah and and so where did you go
25:07 - from there like so you're in high school
25:09 - you're building games like do you show
25:11 - your friends you said that you didn't uh
25:13 - that you kind of kept your game
25:14 - development to yourself because nobody
25:15 - was interested in that stuff they're
25:17 - probably interested in you know typical
25:18 - high school stuff like football and
25:19 - getting a car and other stuff like you
25:21 - grew up in California right like you
25:23 - said you moved for what uh area of
25:26 - California were you in I live in San
25:28 - Diego and went to a very very Urban
25:30 - school so yeah a lot of the kids there
25:33 - they're used to playing like the Call of
25:35 - Duties and Need for Speed and all the
25:37 - you know the the triaa games I'll never
25:39 - forget I showed my friend I I had this
25:42 - really uh rudimentary but cool drifting
25:45 - game like like car drifting game yeah
25:48 - drift racing game that I showed my
25:50 - friend and it was like gray box and
25:52 - whatnot but and he just laughed at me
25:55 - he's like what is this like why would I
25:57 - ever play this you know and I mean
26:00 - listen I understand where he's coming
26:02 - from you know why would he waste his
26:03 - time playing that when there's like Need
26:04 - for Speed etc etc but I'll never forget
26:06 - that experience I like yeah I'll just
26:08 - keep this in my little Forum friends
26:10 - that sucks man that's that's so
26:12 - discouraging but like like let's talk
26:15 - about kind of opening up and blossoming
26:17 - of the BR as you kind of like so you're
26:20 - going to have lots of encounters like
26:21 - that just like like I had similar
26:23 - encounters with my writing like I'd
26:25 - write like a short story I'd show it to
26:26 - somebody they'd be like oh man this is
26:28 - why would I read this when I can go read
26:30 - you know you know bestselling book by
26:32 - somebody right that you get it like the
26:34 - supermarket or whatever you know like
26:37 - how did you kind of did you ever stop
26:40 - doing game development at any point I
26:42 - did I did I had a I think it was like a
26:46 - four-year gap of I didn't really touch
26:48 - code at all wow
26:50 - um yeah it was so The Story Goes at 15 I
26:56 - introduced to game maker five and then
26:59 - I'm making games really passionate about
27:01 - it but then I think I I turned like a
27:04 - junior in high school and all of a
27:06 - sudden like you know I'm interested in
27:08 - girls and being cool and going to
27:11 - parties and stuff right and so that's
27:13 - where I start to invest a lot of my time
27:14 - and I just like stopped touching code um
27:17 - but I pick it back up at I think like 23
27:21 - or something like that so from 19 to
27:23 - like 23 four years something like that
27:25 - 23 24 um is when I pick it back up again
27:28 - cuz you know if you have a passion for
27:30 - something like no matter what it's
27:32 - always going to poke you so hey was it
27:34 - like calling to you from the bookshelf
27:36 - like you just walk by your old uh Unity
27:38 - books back in the day we'd like buy
27:40 - actual gay like books like these big
27:43 - thick books some of them would come with
27:44 - CD ROMs and stuff I don't know if that
27:45 - may have been before your time CU you're
27:47 - a little bit younger than me but like
27:48 - did you ever like look at your old
27:50 - things like oh like kind of like heave
27:53 - like your chest little huh like like Toy
27:56 - Story when he kind of like gets tired of
27:58 - the toys and uh maybe Toy Story 10 Toy
28:01 - Story 11 he actually becomes like Tom
28:03 - Hanks character from big where he's like
28:05 - working at an exe you know as like a toy
28:07 - tester at some big toy company or
28:09 - something like that you know like like
28:11 - pining back for the for the toys did you
28:13 - ever feel that kind of like that you
28:16 - were trying to deny a part of yourself
28:20 - that Society was like causing you to
28:21 - like deler V deler from that childhood
28:25 - ambition yeah I think in hindsight I
28:27 - definitely agree with that obviously in
28:29 - the moment I I didn't have any awareness
28:30 - of this but yeah I think it hit a point
28:33 - where I realized that all these things
28:35 - that I was chasing externally didn't
28:37 - really matter you know like when the
28:39 - friends dried up and the party stopped
28:41 - you know calling me to come over all
28:44 - you're left with is these memories that
28:45 - you have as a kid you know spending 16
28:48 - hours a day developing this game that 10
28:50 - people are going to look at you know
28:52 - yeah and yeah it was calling me back I
28:55 - was like hey look I you know really
28:57 - enjoyed those times s and I want to have
29:00 - memories like that again so I picked up
29:02 - game maker again started making some
29:03 - games again and then it hit a point
29:05 - where I wanted to 3D and so Unity was
29:07 - that option yeah so like once you hit
29:11 - the ground running with unity like like
29:13 - maybe you can just take us give us a
29:16 - quick tour of the next few years of your
29:17 - life like what what were you doing did
29:19 - you have the equivalent of like you know
29:23 - Kanye staying at home an entire summer
29:25 - making beats you know like where it was
29:27 - like a Renaissance of creativity or like
29:30 - what happened yeah yeah yeah yeah I I
29:33 - yes 100% that that was me from 15 to
29:36 - like 18 like every single Summer from
29:39 - that point on I was like nope don't want
29:40 - to go to parties no don't want to do
29:41 - anything I'm just going to sit here in
29:42 - code games um but in terms of so I I I
29:48 - got to
29:49 - Unity I think around like 23
29:52 - 24 and then I'm making games in unity
29:55 - and I'm watching all these different
29:56 - tutorials and whatnot and I'm also
29:59 - making YouTube videos not I'm not making
30:01 - the YouTube videos I'm making today I'm
30:02 - making like documentary style YouTube
30:05 - videos but then I realized that like
30:07 - there's a lot of people that have
30:09 - tutorials on how to like make these
30:11 - games and whatnot right but there
30:13 - weren't a lot of channels of people
30:15 - making stuff from what they learn from
30:17 - the tutorials yeah and I was like I'm
30:20 - going to do that that sounds like fun
30:23 - you know you kind of found a new Lane uh
30:25 - and and like I have lots of friends who
30:26 - do this genre of YouTube video where
30:29 - they're like I built this game like like
30:31 - or they speed up the development and
30:33 - it's like just lightning fast like here
30:35 - now we got the character jumping and not
30:36 - like slumping over and stuff like that
30:38 - right so like I to some extent I think
30:40 - you inspired or helped inspire a lot of
30:42 - people who now do that kind of uh game
30:45 - development and like actually apply the
30:47 - skills that they learned from tutorials
30:48 - on like free code camp and places like
30:49 - that right can you talk about like an
30:52 - early video that you created and at what
30:54 - point did you start uploading videos to
30:55 - YouTube it was like maybe like eight or
30:57 - eight or nine years
30:58 - ago yeah that's a whole other that's a
31:01 - whole other Branch but yeah
31:04 - yeah been a long time before we get to
31:07 - that you've been building games like I'm
31:10 - just trying to bridge the past with the
31:12 - present like yeah what point did you
31:14 - start like like did you why did you even
31:17 - approach YouTube did you were you like
31:18 - this can help me raise awareness of my
31:20 - games or I just I have time I'm just
31:22 - going to create some videos for myself
31:23 - and my friends what was your philosophy
31:26 - I I've done a lot of things all right
31:28 - I've done a lot of things I'm going to
31:29 - make it really brief because that's a
31:31 - whole other branch of the story but to
31:33 - make it short and correlated to the
31:35 - coding stuff when I was in high school
31:37 - me and some buddies got together and
31:39 - decided to make a a YouTube channel okay
31:41 - we didn't have any skills we didn't
31:42 - really know anything so we made a prank
31:44 - Channel okay it was just a thing to do
31:46 - back then and that taught me a lot about
31:50 - uh how to build audiences how lucrative
31:54 - it can be to create internet content and
31:57 - so that bug that that bug was like the
32:00 - the foundation for me to later create
32:02 - the Channel that I have
32:04 - today but so long story short it hit a
32:07 - point where the pranks where YouTube
32:09 - demonetized all pranks across the
32:11 - platform I was okay this this Jig Is up
32:13 - right yeah however I knew that there was
32:15 - still a lot of value in speaking to an
32:17 - audience and you know giving them
32:18 - entertainment and value and so I made a
32:21 - documentary Channel where I would just
32:23 - document various things that was
32:24 - happening all the while in the
32:26 - background I come home and I'm coding
32:28 - like hours and hours and hours at night
32:30 - but it didn't dawn on me to share what I
32:32 - was doing it was this is past game maker
32:35 - Forum so I didn't really have anyone to
32:37 - share it with it was just kind of like a
32:38 - me thing I did for myself you know as a
32:40 - as a meditation if you
32:43 - will but yeah one day it hit me that I
32:47 - spend I was spending so many hours
32:49 - developing games and apps so many hours
32:53 - watching tutorials and what I wanted was
32:56 - more content on YouTube
32:58 - of people demonstrating their learnings
33:01 - from these this content and at the time
33:04 - there was maybe one person that was
33:06 - doing
33:07 - it and so I decided to completely
33:11 - Rebrand my channel to
33:13 - jabrils we're doing coding now and I
33:16 - think like the fourth video blew up I
33:19 - did a AI machine learning project in
33:22 - unity and uh good times good
33:26 - times yeah so um first of all why is
33:30 - there an S at the end of your name
33:31 - jabrils is like Jail's Channel
33:35 - or is that why I I love this question um
33:40 - you're going to be a little disappointed
33:42 - the answer is just because I find it
33:46 - funny I can't tell you how many times
33:48 - like i' I've been in rooms with execs
33:50 - and they call me jbr's plural and it's
33:53 - just so it's just funny I don't know if
33:56 - I call it's test of whether people
33:58 - actually know who you are
34:01 - like no we like um so I have a friend uh
34:06 - and what she does is like she puts like
34:07 - an emoji like a Ramen Emoji or something
34:09 - at the front of her LinkedIn name that
34:11 - way when like recruiters or some
34:13 - automated message sends it it always she
34:15 - can always see the ramen Emoji at the
34:16 - beginning of her name and she knows oh
34:18 - this isn't a real person who knows me
34:20 - this is just like some bulk like mail or
34:23 - something like that so smart
34:26 - unfortunately no I just find it funny
34:28 - when people refer to me as a plural it's
34:30 - just funny it's like if I call you
34:32 - Quincy as you multiple people it's just
34:34 - funny that's it yeah that'd be like the
34:36 - Quincy from Bleach everybody's tell I
34:38 - haven't seen bleach but everybody's like
34:39 - oh yeah the quincies like people
34:41 - occasionally every once in a while you
34:42 - get this email I want let you take my
34:44 - bonai what's bonai you know but
34:47 - apparently there's like this race of
34:49 - like Angels or something like that in in
34:51 - this show Bleach and they're the most
34:53 - powerful cuz they can take away like the
34:55 - Bleach characters like weapon the Bon
34:58 - anyway sorry but but like yeah so you
35:03 - have this YouTube channel the fourth
35:05 - video blows up of course like this
35:07 - happens to a lot of people like free C
35:09 - Camp we published uh you know some
35:11 - videos that really blew up like after
35:13 - like I think like three or four years
35:14 - and we're like oh should we chase this
35:15 - success like maybe we should lean into
35:17 - this like Lane that we found and it's
35:20 - it's hard to reproduce that lightning in
35:22 - the bottle yeah what was your like after
35:24 - that fourth video what happened I did
35:27 - not learn learn my lesson unfortunately
35:29 - it took me a while to learn my lesson
35:31 - what I mean by that is so this video
35:34 - blows up and it reaches a large audience
35:36 - an audience I've never seen before
35:39 - and in hindsight I realized like what I
35:42 - should have done was really capitalize
35:44 - on the audience give them more of what
35:45 - they wanted but instead I continued to
35:48 - make content that you know was just
35:50 - really for me and the views didn't
35:53 - really match that but I I think it was a
35:56 - really important part to to my journey
35:58 - but it did give me a greater audience
36:00 - than what I had previously
36:02 - but yeah so so maybe you could talk
36:04 - about that balance of like balancing
36:06 - your own interest rather than just
36:07 - becoming like YouTuber person who's the
36:10 - generically approachable interesting
36:12 - person that like you know probably does
36:15 - well on YouTube but but I think to some
36:18 - extent the algorithm probably forces you
36:20 - in certain directions in terms of uh
36:23 - being not yourself but being who people
36:25 - want you to be right like I imagine if
36:28 - you're like a late night TV show host
36:29 - you have to shave off a lot of the edges
36:32 - and and you know like probably similar
36:34 - with YouTube I I mean I don't know this
36:37 - because I've steadfastly refused to
36:40 - adopt like various conventions around
36:42 - you know video podcasting like I didn't
36:43 - even do video podcasting for a long time
36:45 - and now that we're doing them I'm doing
36:46 - them in like a kind of a weird way like
36:48 - no editing uh any of that stuff that
36:50 - it's like unconventional but it's I want
36:53 - to do it I want it to be real right like
36:57 - how did you balance like you probably
36:59 - saw the numbers like oh people don't
37:01 - like the real jabril as much as they
37:02 - like the jabril from video number four
37:05 - do I have to like put myself in a you
37:07 - know freeze myself in time and just be
37:09 - that exact person for every video if I
37:10 - want to get traction like did you go
37:12 - through that kind of like soul
37:14 - searching it it took me a while to to
37:16 - understand that dichotomy of content uh
37:19 - I'm I'm saying like probably a couple
37:21 - years ago when I really understood this
37:23 - this dichotomy of content um but at the
37:26 - time you you know I was just happy to
37:28 - have any audience watch this watch stuff
37:30 - that I was doing uh but yeah I I it I
37:34 - think that it's not necessarily like
37:36 - what the algorithm is encouraging I
37:39 - think it's more rooted in just human
37:41 - nature right like you turn on any show
37:43 - and you you have some expectation as to
37:46 - what you're going to see right if you
37:48 - turn on America's Funniest Home Videos
37:51 - and all of a sudden they start showing
37:52 - like an a hockey match you be like yeah
37:56 - what what is this I'm never going to
37:57 - watch this again right and you know it's
38:00 - a lesson I had to learn and it is really
38:02 - unfortunate but on top of that I think
38:04 - it's what has inspired me to do things
38:06 - like create a manga or create a game
38:11 - because that element of pleasing an
38:14 - audience really only affects you when
38:16 - you rely on it to pay your bills right I
38:19 - don't rely on the manga or the game that
38:21 - I'm making Ultra bers to to pay my bills
38:24 - therefore I can be as free as I want in
38:26 - my expression with those projects
38:28 - and you know the the the goal with the
38:31 - YouTube channel is to hopefully get to
38:32 - someday where I figure out a way to have
38:35 - that free expression while also paying
38:37 - my bills but it's easier said than done
38:39 - and I'm I'm currently in that Journey so
38:41 - yeah so if you don't mind me asking like
38:43 - like how how do you pay the bills like
38:46 - uh and and maybe you can talk about how
38:48 - you paid the bills like graduating from
38:49 - high school and just you if you
38:51 - graduated and and progressing in general
38:54 - I say if you graduated cuz I I didn't
38:56 - graduate I dropped out as a sopore
38:57 - but like a lot of people uh like they
39:00 - they kind of have this listless period
39:03 - uh did you go to
39:05 - university I went to Junior College for
39:08 - a couple years and then dropped out okay
39:10 - so lot going for the wrong degre yeah
39:13 - what were you wrong degree I was
39:15 - studying film and communication no one
39:17 - told me all right no one told me um but
39:20 - we're s we're literally sitting in class
39:22 - watching movies and like writing essays
39:24 - on movies and I'm just like what what am
39:26 - I doing
39:28 - and so I I was I dropped out with the
39:30 - plan to return to do biology cuz I love
39:32 - biology so much but I learned that my
39:35 - financial aid right now and I was not
39:37 - down to to a loan so yeah well so you
39:40 - dodged the loan bullet uh that's good
39:43 - like you did you figured it out before
39:45 - you had taken on a whole lot of you know
39:47 - potentially restrictive debt that you'd
39:49 - have to pay off um which the credit card
39:51 - they the credit card companies hate me
39:53 - for they tell me I need different types
39:55 - of loans yeah exactly
39:58 - uh well congratulations on that so you
40:01 - you dropped out of Junior College what
40:04 - happens what do you do this is like at
40:06 - some point you did create the YouTube
40:07 - channel but like or maybe you've been
40:09 - doing the YouTube channel for a while
40:11 - but like how did you get from that
40:14 - jabril that didn't really know what what
40:17 - to do to a person who you know has a
40:22 - pretty large like half a million
40:24 - subscriber YouTube channel who's like a
40:26 - household name among game developers who
40:30 - uh built a lot of games and has a lot of
40:32 - games in the App Store and just comes up
40:34 - with really cool projects that we're
40:36 - going to talk a little bit about later
40:38 - like seemingly like every few months you
40:40 - you pop up you're like hey here's this
40:41 - crazy new thing that nobody's ever done
40:43 - before like how did you what what was
40:45 - the transition period yeah between those
40:48 - two
40:49 - people yeah so I I've always had
40:52 - multiple things going on like since as
40:55 - early as I can remember and at the time
40:58 - that I'm doing College I'm also filming
41:00 - for the prank Channel that I was talking
41:02 - about not too long ago and so me and my
41:05 - buddies will get together on the weekend
41:06 - we film the prank stuff and that it
41:08 - didn't pay any bills like it was you
41:10 - know it paid gas for us to get around
41:12 - town every once in a while we get like a
41:13 - sponsor deal and we would split it but I
41:17 - did that at that time I was I was living
41:20 - off financial aid but after that ended I
41:23 - got I started doing a bunch of odd jobs
41:25 - so I worked at a comedy club uh what
41:29 - were you doing
41:31 - then I was I didn't have an official
41:33 - title so it was a new comedy club that
41:35 - opened up in San Diego called American
41:37 - Comedy Co and I just remember code uh
41:40 - emailing the owner because there's a
41:42 - bunch of articles on it and I was like
41:44 - hey I will do anything please just let
41:46 - me help you out I was like yeah sure
41:48 - come by and then I came by and I never
41:50 - had official title but I helped out with
41:52 - marketing I helped out with um you know
41:55 - a little design and whatnot
41:58 - uh that was a lot of fun but that ended
42:00 - for me and then I got into doing uh
42:03 - working at a radio
42:04 - station uh all the while all the while
42:07 - I'm still making YouTube videos trying
42:08 - to figure that part
42:10 - out and then I worked at the radio
42:12 - station for about four years to pay the
42:15 - bills and then oh man I don't know how
42:19 - deep you want to go into this I've done
42:20 - a lot let's do it Comedy Club to a radio
42:24 - station you've had an interesting life
42:25 - so far yeah
42:28 - okay and
42:29 - so so the radio station was the last job
42:31 - that I ever
42:32 - worked and when I left the radio station
42:36 - life got incredibly interesting and
42:38 - difficult at the same
42:40 - time man okay I'm G break it down
42:44 - so at the at the end of me working at
42:47 - the radio station I had a friend that I
42:48 - knew that made prank videos that I met
42:50 - through making prank videos right his
42:52 - name is Garrett his Channel's called
42:55 - over when you say prank video just give
42:56 - us an idea of what a prank video would
42:58 - this be like like MTV punked or
43:00 - something like that or like what what is
43:01 - it what is a prank
43:03 - video
43:05 - so I'm trying to think my favorite prank
43:08 - video that we did so like one video that
43:10 - I did is um I did like a magic trick so
43:13 - I had like a shirt that had a graphic on
43:16 - it but it was like a it was like a magic
43:18 - trick shirt right so like I go and ask
43:20 - people for directions say hey do you
43:22 - know where this thing is and they point
43:23 - me to directions but then like I turn
43:24 - around and do a magic trick the the
43:26 - graphic would change and I turn around
43:27 - it's a new uh graphic and then like wait
43:31 - did your shirt change I'm like what were
43:33 - you talking so it's stuff like that you
43:34 - okay so basically kind of like uh yeah
43:36 - yeah it's just like gaslighting people
43:40 - essentially just that's one way to put
43:42 - it Quincy
43:44 - yeah Okay cool so so I'm sorry like I
43:47 - just wanted to get an idea that sounds
43:49 - like a pretty cool I didn't know there
43:50 - were like design changing shirt I won't
43:53 - ask the mechanics of that cuz I don't
43:54 - want to ruin it if you know how what
43:56 - happens with the quarter when it's
43:57 - supposedly behind your ear it makes it a
43:58 - lot less interesting right but um maybe
44:01 - you can talk about that go back to that
44:02 - friend who was doing these videos with
44:04 - you yeah so so he had his own channel
44:07 - and he had a lot of success from uh
44:10 - doing YouTube
44:11 - pranks way more than I had right and we
44:15 - had reconnected when I was working at
44:16 - the radio station and you said hey I
44:17 - need help filming are you willing to
44:19 - like you lived in Orange County I lived
44:21 - in San Diego it's about 100 miles
44:23 - something like that apart yeah both very
44:25 - nice places to live by the way
44:27 - very very nice places
44:29 - indeed and so I agreed I I would go up
44:32 - to his house I think on the weekends and
44:34 - then stay for a few days help him film
44:37 - then I go back home uh but it hit a
44:40 - point where I was filming with him so
44:42 - much I had forgot that I had a shift at
44:44 - the radio
44:45 - station and they called me and they're
44:47 - like hey you have a shift I'm like I am
44:50 - not in town I cannot make it and so like
44:53 - they call me in they like give me the
44:54 - talk and whatnot they didn't fire me
44:56 - thankfully but I go back to my buddy and
44:58 - I'm telling him about this this this
45:00 - dilemma how fun it is to film with him
45:02 - and how annoying it is to go work at
45:04 - this radio station he's like you should
45:06 - just quit you should quit come work with
45:08 - me I'll pay you some money and it'll all
45:10 - be good and like I'm terrified you know
45:12 - content creation is very risky and So
45:15 - eventually I say okay I'll do it I quit
45:18 - I go work with him a month later we're
45:21 - no longer working together what happened
45:24 - I
45:25 - had there's a lot of drama there's a lot
45:27 - of drama he was going through some stuff
45:29 - in his life um but it's all public if
45:32 - you don't look it up okay my homie
45:34 - overboard humor shouts to Garrett shouts
45:36 - to Garrett um but long story so so after
45:41 - a month of working with him I'm no
45:42 - longer working with him I had maybe
45:45 - $2,000 in savings and I'm like what did
45:47 - I just do and so the content creation is
45:52 - not really doing anything for me uh I
45:54 - take up a lot of odd jobs which is
45:56 - really difficult to do in San Diego at
45:58 - least with the skill set that I had of
45:59 - like film making and
46:01 - whatnot and I I'll never forget I gave
46:04 - up I was like I'm done I'm done throwing
46:05 - in the towel I'm just going to go work
46:07 - some job and figure out how to live a
46:09 - regular casual life and so I take an
46:11 - interview at a store called Joan's
46:13 - fabric
46:15 - stores so like literally like generic
46:19 - retail essentially just just just give
46:22 - me some money I'm going to be like one
46:23 - of the characters from clerks basically
46:25 - just give me some money yeah that that
46:27 - was my only priority and I'll never
46:29 - forget I walked in there and the manager
46:31 - takes me to his room really small
46:33 - cramped room with boxes
46:35 - everywhere and he's like okay so tell me
46:37 - a bit about yourself I tell him he's
46:39 - like interesting what what are your what
46:41 - are your dreams what do you want to do
46:43 - and I was taken back by that question
46:44 - and I told him I was like you know I
46:46 - really wish that I could you know build
46:47 - a YouTube channel and travel the world
46:49 - etc etc and he closes this little book
46:52 - and he says I'll never forget this you
46:55 - don't belong here
46:57 - I'm not going to hire you and I was like
46:59 - what he like yeah all I'm going to do is
47:01 - use you to stock shelves uh stock books
47:04 - uh boxes on shelves I just need someone
47:05 - tall that's it I'll be wasting your
47:08 - talent I I kid you not I kid you not and
47:11 - so I walk out of there just like what
47:13 - just happened but that gave me the
47:14 - energy that I needed to really push as
47:16 - hard as possible on content creation wow
47:20 - shout out to Joan's fabric store like
47:22 - the the manager there for setting you on
47:24 - that course that's great yeah I I wish I
47:27 - would have went and got his name and
47:28 - shook his hand but uh I'll never foret
47:31 - that if he can see you
47:34 - now yeah so that that gave me all the
47:36 - energy I needed I was so fired up after
47:39 - that and I did a bunch of content
47:40 - creation I I spent maybe eight hours a
47:43 - day doing odd job or or looking for odd
47:46 - jobs to enough where it would pay my
47:47 - bills and then one day I came across
47:49 - this odd job from someone who's looking
47:51 - for help to film physics content which
47:54 - happened to be Diana Cowern from physics
47:57 - girl and so huge YouTube channel huge
48:00 - science learning Science Education
48:02 - Channel yeah and I responded to that did
48:07 - some editing for her she liked it and
48:09 - I've been with her editor for like three
48:11 - four years and very incredibly
48:13 - grateful shout outs to Diana I uh can't
48:18 - wait for her to get better yeah
48:21 - absolutely yeah yeah so um so you're
48:25 - doing editing and and is that like how
48:29 - did you transition into like building
48:32 - some of these games were you doing games
48:33 - at the same time maybe just give us a
48:36 - little bit more context into the
48:37 - timeline so that's cool so you've made
48:40 - the transition from Radio which is
48:42 - probably a job a lot of people who study
48:44 - Communications and journalism uh and
48:46 - things like that would be interested in
48:48 - going into but um you know you stopped
48:51 - working in radio and but now you're
48:53 - working in editing for YouTube creators
48:57 - and you're still creating your own stuff
48:58 - on the side but you're paying the bills
49:00 - by working with you know a much more
49:02 - successful like name brand YouTube
49:04 - Creator right correct yes yeah so
49:07 - so yeah I would pay the bills doing a
49:10 - bunch of jobs but all the entire time
49:12 - I'm creating content like it's not
49:15 - getting views it's not making any money
49:17 - but I'm creating content the entire time
49:18 - because it was it was a fun thing to do
49:20 - that I really enjoyed and I always
49:23 - believed in his
49:24 - potential just to get the timeline
49:27 - synced yeah okay awesome and did you
49:30 - have other videos that started to get
49:32 - traction like that like your fourth
49:34 - video did you did you kind of
49:36 - like strike gold so to speak or or like
49:39 - uh kind of find that filament that like
49:42 - lights the bulb correctly to use like a
49:44 - weird uh Thomas Edison analogy like were
49:47 - you able to like iterate toward a
49:49 - formula that worked that would that also
49:51 - resonated with your passion as a
49:54 - Creator a little bit a little bit again
49:57 - in hindsight I think that I I probably
49:59 - should have been learning more lessons
50:01 - rapid more rapidly than I did at the
50:03 - time but I had did the first video of uh
50:06 - Mak a machine learning game it was like
50:09 - writing my first machine learning game
50:10 - something like that it went crazy viral
50:12 - and then I just continue to upload
50:14 - videos like as I seen it and then I
50:16 - struck gold again I made another video
50:18 - called making a game in 48 hours like
50:20 - this is before this was a trend and that
50:23 - video also went really viral but at the
50:26 - time like I was honestly just getting
50:27 - lucky you know I I was learning like
50:29 - little lessons here and there but it
50:32 - wasn't until I connected with a bunch of
50:34 - other content creators and they were
50:35 - able a like share lessons between each
50:37 - other where I really started to adapt
50:40 - you know optimal strategies if you will
50:42 - yeah yeah and like just looking at your
50:44 - most popular videos many of which I've
50:46 - watched uh you know the infinite
50:48 - staircase is real nearly 8 million years
50:51 - my first learning machine learning like
50:53 - about 2 million for that and also the 48
50:56 - hour game Jam thing uh Minecraft but on
51:01 - a quantum computer you know stuff like
51:03 - that very cool so uh a lot of your
51:05 - videos have connected with the audience
51:08 - and like I guess Way Beyond your
51:09 - audience have had like mainstream appeal
51:11 - over the years can you talk about like
51:13 - what that's like in terms of uh does
51:17 - when you have a video that goes viral
51:19 - like your infinite staircase video did
51:21 - uh I mean 8 million views for like a
51:25 - sciency topic this is not like some you
51:28 - know you're you're not like a hot woman
51:30 - or something like that right like you're
51:32 - you're just a guy who's developing
51:34 - interesting stuff he's like building
51:36 - stuff and showcasing what he's building
51:38 - um can you talk about like the the
51:41 - audience and the experience of having
51:42 - that video blow up I think I've had like
51:45 - a a tweet go viral with the BTS Army and
51:49 - that's like my 15 minutes of fame is
51:51 - like I I I tweeted something about like
51:53 - BTS just not even realizing what I was
51:55 - tweeting and like all these people
51:56 - jumped on me and that I guess that got
51:59 - like 15 million retweets or something
52:00 - like that that's like the closest I've
52:01 - ever gotten to famous so to speak but
52:04 - did you feel famous did things did it
52:07 - feel different to have a video getting
52:09 - all these views and people commenting
52:10 - and talking about it and sharing it uh I
52:12 - think
52:14 - unfortunately the sad part about
52:15 - consecration is you normalize it after a
52:18 - while
52:20 - and the any everything on the jbros
52:23 - channel comes after like some pre Fame
52:26 - that experienced so I did a prank with
52:29 - some buddies a long time ago where
52:34 - we we
52:36 - would I don't know if this is bad or not
52:38 - but it was what it was okay we went up
52:41 - to people and we asked them if they
52:42 - wanted a little pot okay right like pot
52:46 - marijuana we asked them if they wanted a
52:48 - little pot right a little pot they like
52:50 - they like no get away from me freak what
52:52 - the hell and then we would pull out a
52:54 - literal little pot like a literal little
52:57 - pot a cooking pot and that video went
53:01 - crazy viral back in the days and I had
53:03 - so many people reach out to me I was on
53:05 - TV uh someone offered to buy me a meal
53:08 - like it was it was crazy that was the
53:10 - first time it actually felt crazy um but
53:12 - everything after that I think I kind of
53:13 - normalized the experience a bit so
53:15 - you're just kind of like you're the
53:16 - equivalent of that kid like at the
53:18 - computer in the meme like yeah thumbs up
53:20 - it worked you know but then you kind of
53:21 - move on with the the content grind right
53:25 - yeah um and and you view is a a grinder
53:27 - like how how do you approach creating
53:30 - these videos about you know programming
53:32 - computer science and and demonstrating
53:34 - different projects You're
53:37 - Building yeah I don't ever do it for any
53:41 - of the fame or any things like that like
53:43 - I I do it genuinely because I love the
53:46 - ideas and I I love being able to explore
53:48 - new Concepts that probably someone
53:50 - hasn't really explored at least in the
53:52 - manner that that I want to explore it
53:55 - and so my Approach is always
53:57 - is how can I present something to you
54:01 - that you probably don't think about that
54:03 - often or probably haven't seen before in
54:05 - an entertaining
54:07 - manner uh that often when those two meet
54:10 - is often when my videos do the best yeah
54:14 - yeah well let's talk a little bit about
54:15 - Game Dev in general because Game Dev has
54:18 - changed a lot since you got into it
54:20 - obviously like game maker like there was
54:21 - a game called like Hotline Miami that
54:23 - did they use Game Maker for that they
54:24 - use like some really rudimentary like
54:26 - early tool to develop I believe they did
54:28 - yeah and I believe they that was a cool
54:29 - game because it felt like you wouldn't
54:33 - know that they'd use such simple tools
54:35 - to create such an elaborate game with
54:37 - like its own kind of physics engine and
54:38 - everything like that but
54:41 - like there was that whole Flash game era
54:45 - that you develop flash games CU
54:47 - newgrounds.com was huge when I was a kid
54:49 - or when I was a teenager like people
54:51 - would like develop these games you could
54:52 - play right in your browser and it just
54:54 - took accessibility to a new level cuz
54:56 - you just click on it it loads and you
54:58 - play it you don't have to download stuff
54:59 - you don't have to like buy a physical
55:01 - media that you put into a console or
55:03 - anything like
55:04 - that yeah I definitely played more flash
55:07 - games than I
55:08 - made uh I might be mistaken on the
55:11 - timeline but I think by the time I was
55:13 - able to you know grasp logic and coding
55:17 - it was kind of past its prime I may have
55:20 - the timeline incorrect here but I
55:21 - definitely remember when I was younger
55:24 - playing flash games this was like before
55:26 - for Smash Bros and all that mhm
55:29 - um and but I do remember trying I made
55:32 - like one Flash game and I just remember
55:33 - being really annoying the UI interface
55:36 - in in
55:38 - Adobe what was
55:39 - that adobe adob I don't know yeah Adobe
55:42 - Flash yeah Adobe Flash yeah they renamed
55:45 - it so my brain was was yeah Adobe Flash
55:48 - the the UI was really annoying in my
55:49 - personal opinion and I had already had
55:51 - game maker experience so I just
55:52 - preferred game maker but yeah well um um
55:56 - maybe you can talk about like the game
55:58 - development meta so to speak like
56:00 - like who is working on games like are
56:05 - are is it mostly hobbyist are there like
56:07 - hardcore game devs out there that like
56:10 - like like how would you describe the
56:12 - typical game developer in terms of like
56:15 - how they're approaching getting games
56:17 - done I saw the the documentary Indie G
56:20 - Indie Dev uh indie game yeah that was
56:23 - pretty good but I've heard like mixed
56:25 - things from actual game developers about
56:26 - like how representative it is of the
56:28 - typical Game Dev experience and things
56:30 - like that and obviously all three of
56:31 - those games were pretty popular
56:33 - successful in G so it's already kind of
56:35 - like uh showing like a little bit of
56:38 - selection bias survivorship bias I guess
56:41 - uh I I imagine like most projects most
56:43 - don't go anywhere right they probably
56:45 - don't even get completed it's rare that
56:47 - people even finish projects that they
56:48 - start right but like maybe you could
56:50 - talk about like what your how would you
56:53 - describe like a typical game developers
56:55 - lifestyle and and where they hang out
56:57 - like whether that's Discord whether
56:59 - that's um like local kind of game
57:02 - developer hacker space type places maybe
57:06 - you could just give me an idea of you
57:08 - know the the devs that you've come
57:10 - across and you've worked alongside and
57:12 - maybe give us a little more context in
57:14 - your
57:15 - process um do you mind refining the
57:18 - question a bit more yeah absolutely that
57:19 - was like 15 questions in
57:21 - one what do game devs do Daya what's the
57:26 - typical day in the life of a Game
57:28 - Dev yeah so I think like most things
57:31 - there's a lot of variation right and as
57:34 - game development has got more and more
57:36 - accessible I think the variation has
57:38 - only increased so like I know people
57:41 - that are they like game development is
57:43 - their full-time job right they've
57:45 - released some games to some audiences
57:46 - that love to play their games they
57:48 - charge them for it and they can pay the
57:50 - bills that way right I know game
57:52 - developers that you know they're
57:54 - habitually making a game count in it
57:56 - making a game canceling it making a game
57:58 - cancel it right I know game developers
57:59 - that are always looking for funding
58:02 - right they are going up to investors
58:04 - saying like hey I have this idea will
58:06 - you please give me money to make it
58:07 - right and I know game developers that
58:09 - just do the YouTube thing right there's
58:11 - a lot of
58:12 - variation um but I will say thank you I
58:16 - will say that I think the the
58:18 - commonality between them all is that a
58:20 - lot of them have like a a lot of passion
58:22 - for making games and and telling stories
58:24 - and uh
58:26 - you know trying to present something
58:28 - cool and creative to an audience yeah
58:31 - what what are some I think the most
58:33 - important thing if you are trying to be
58:35 - a game developer that can actually ship
58:36 - games is scope you have to learn scope
58:42 - uh I think that's top of the funnel next
58:43 - up is Passion focus on games that you
58:47 - you yourself want to
58:49 - play and then after that I would say is
58:52 - audience try toate games for existing
58:55 - audiences
58:57 - um I think if you pair all those three
58:58 - things together you will have a lot of
59:01 - games under your belt which which and
59:03 - and I want to emphasize how important it
59:05 - is to actually ship games I think it's
59:08 - fun to like habitually explore new
59:10 - Concepts and whatnot but shipping games
59:13 - is what you get critiqued on you don't
59:14 - get get critiqued on you know how well
59:18 - you can Implement a pathf finding
59:20 - algorithm you know what I mean yeah that
59:23 - makes total sense so just uh to recap
59:26 - scope passion for what you're building
59:28 - and having an existing audience not
59:30 - having to like Forge out in the wild for
59:32 - people that are interested in your
59:33 - completely novel game um but can you
59:36 - describe scope like and maybe how you
59:39 - Scope things and and where scope creeps
59:41 - maybe just start by defining
59:45 - scope
59:47 - yeah uh so so scope is the hardest one
59:50 - because it does require
59:51 - some like prior knowledge
59:54 - on what whatever you're building right
59:56 - like so if I'm building a game that
59:58 - requires pathf finding I have to have
60:00 - some knowledge on like the domain of
60:02 - pathf finding to be able to scope it um
60:05 - and pathfinding is like like having an
60:08 - AI kind of like go around in certain
60:11 - paths is it that literally it like just
60:13 - programming NPCs and stuff yeah
60:15 - non-player yeah yeah yeah um so so yeah
60:20 - scope is the hardest because again you
60:22 - need you need to some you need to have
60:24 - some understanding of the domain
60:26 - of whatever you're implementing but it's
60:28 - not impossible to get that information
60:30 - right there's so many resources
60:31 - everywhere you know especially in
60:35 - 2024 but yeah so can you give me an
60:38 - example of a time that you like maybe
60:42 - made scope too broad and scope is like
60:44 - like just basically focusing on a few
60:46 - key game elements or focusing on like
60:49 - what the goals of the project are you
60:51 - know it's easy to think like oh I'm
60:52 - going to create an open world game and
60:53 - it's going to of XYZ and like you know
60:55 - you look at like Cy Punk uh
60:58 - 2077 I can't remember the exact year but
61:00 - like that is a game that had so much
61:03 - scope creep that it ruined the game if
61:04 - they just not made it open world or if
61:06 - they' not tried to add all these
61:08 - different attributes and stuff like they
61:10 - they they got too big for their britches
61:12 - right they they leaned out farther than
61:14 - they they should have in in terms of you
61:16 - know the scope and right yeah and scope
61:19 - can prevent a project from ever getting
61:21 - done because the the scope can keep
61:23 - expanding as an excuse to not actually
61:25 - ship like as a procrastination you know
61:28 - excuse right yeah yeah 100% yeah so so
61:33 - has there been an instance that you can
61:34 - recall where you're like you you're like
61:37 - you know I think I've I've gone outside
61:39 - of my original scope or I I've I've made
61:42 - some sort of error when it comes to
61:43 - scope and I need to correct
61:45 - it it's a problem that I used to have a
61:47 - lot but developing for a YouTube channel
61:51 - it teaches you Scope really quickly
61:54 - because you have a regular schedule of
61:56 - releases like I've only got two months
61:58 - to build this game or like what's your
61:59 - release schedule do you have a fixed
62:02 - schedule yeah every I have to upload one
62:05 - video within 30 days of the last video
62:07 - that's what I operate off of okay it can
62:10 - be seven days it can be 12 days but I
62:12 - can't go more than 30 days okay that's a
62:14 - great rule to live by so that guides
62:17 - like for example I have to publish a
62:19 - podcast every Friday I have to send out
62:21 - an email newsletter every Friday right
62:23 - like so like those things force me to be
62:26 - to myself and the rules I put in place
62:28 - so I love how you have that very simple
62:30 - rule you know I can create videos as
62:33 - frequently as I want but it doesn't
62:34 - matter how many I've published I still
62:36 - need to have one within 30 days of the
62:37 - last one yeah yeah that's really cool
62:40 - it's like like uh yeah so so come full
62:44 - circle so like that that process it
62:46 - really has taught me a lot about scope
62:49 - right because it's it's one thing to be
62:51 - like I want to make this game where I
62:54 - have all my my subscribers connect to a
62:57 - server and they can walk around the
62:58 - world and drive cars like that's one
63:00 - thing right but then just having done
63:03 - this for so long I can have a good idea
63:05 - on like okay how long is it going to
63:06 - take me how many hours I investing if I
63:09 - start this video project in January am I
63:12 - going to finish it in in March or is it
63:14 - going to take me February of next year
63:16 - you know and it's something it's a skill
63:18 - that you have to hone I'm not going to
63:20 - sit here and say that it's easy but it's
63:22 - definitely something that I encourage
63:24 - everyone to pay attention to and try and
63:26 - home you know yeah so one of the things
63:29 - I want to ask is for people that are
63:32 - listening and they're interested in
63:34 - going into game development maybe they
63:35 - have some basic programming chops maybe
63:37 - they've completed cs50 they've gone
63:39 - they've earned a few free codam
63:41 - certifications they have a basic
63:43 - understanding of you know maybe python
63:45 - JavaScript uh maybe they haven't worked
63:47 - with unity yet but you know it sounds
63:49 - like that's a tool you would encourage
63:51 - people to pick up um so let's say
63:54 - hypothetically um they want to be a Game
63:57 - Dev two years from now they want to have
63:59 - a game life or do they even need two
64:01 - years like like what would you do if you
64:03 - starting over with everything you know
64:04 - today but you didn't have the skills you
64:06 - have today you didn't have the network
64:09 - that you have today in terms of like
64:10 - distribution being able to just publish
64:11 - a video on YouTube and have thousands of
64:12 - people see it like what would you do I
64:16 - love this question yes 100%
64:20 - listen
64:21 - nowadays is one of the most like
64:25 - accessible times we've ever lived in for
64:28 - anything and everything if I had to
64:31 - start over given the prompt you just
64:34 - gave I would first of all make a mobile
64:39 - game I would
64:41 - do active
64:42 - development so make an MVP that's
64:46 - minimal viable product yeah mhm launch
64:50 - the
64:51 - MVP start collecting feedback
64:54 - immediately whoever you can get the
64:56 - hands on your mom your brother your
64:59 - coworker whoever it
65:00 - is we have platforms like Tik Tok that
65:05 - you can easily reach an audience if you
65:07 - just learn how the like the different
65:09 - ways to game the system Instagram reals
65:12 - YouTube shorts like these are all
65:14 - platforms that have millions and
65:17 - millions of people watching a ton of
65:19 - content in a short period of
65:21 - time so that's what I would do and and
65:26 - and in fact that's what I'm doing for
65:27 - Ultra bouts all those things I just
65:29 - described I think that is the modernday
65:34 - developer and there's a lot of money to
65:36 - be made you know if you do this as well
65:38 - you know it's add model and if your game
65:41 - is good enough it connects with the
65:42 - audience good enough you can do inapp
65:44 - purchases yeah awesome so that would be
65:46 - your your advice if I can re summarize
65:49 - it is just build an MVP as quickly as
65:52 - possible get it out there start
65:53 - iterating and publicize it through short
65:56 - videos the short video format that is
65:59 - taking over YouTube For Better or Worse
66:01 - um and like of course you know like uh
66:03 - you know potentially programming our
66:05 - kids to be like extremely uh you know um
66:08 - sensitive to their physical appearance
66:10 - right um things like that right so sure
66:12 - sure we don't talk about that can yeah
66:15 - can I add one more caveat yeah last
66:17 - thing I want to add to that is really
66:19 - important is no one to quit no when to
66:21 - quit okay tell me about no one to quit
66:23 - no when to quit I'm taking
66:26 - notes so if you do all these things and
66:30 - you see that like no one's really
66:31 - responding no one really cares about
66:33 - your MVP or update 3 whatever it is you
66:37 - have to realize that maybe you just did
66:39 - not create a product that has a good
66:42 - Market
66:43 - fit and move on to the next one it's sad
66:47 - sometimes it sucks but it all depends on
66:49 - what you're looking for if you're
66:50 - looking to actually be a game developer
66:52 - that you can get Awards and all these
66:54 - accolades and pay your bills
66:56 - knowing when to quit is very important
66:58 - and it it's hard when we talk about like
67:01 - art but the truth of the matter is
67:04 - nowadays we have a completely different
67:07 - system you can't it's much harder
67:10 - for you to be the
67:13 - artist wait hold on let me let me
67:16 - rephrase that yeah nowadays it's more
67:19 - expected that you not only just the
67:21 - artist or the sound designer or the
67:24 - programmer you're all you weren't all
67:25 - hats now right once upon a time you can
67:29 - go work for a company and just play that
67:31 - role and have someone else figure out
67:32 - when to quit right but now you wear all
67:36 - the hats and you have to you know put on
67:37 - your business hat
67:38 - and you know pay attention to things so
67:41 - the brutal suit that's within you the uh
67:43 - the the pointy haired boss right the uh
67:46 - the the person who has to you know make
67:48 - the cold calculated business decision
67:52 - that person is the same as the creative
67:55 - genius who's like scrolling all over the
67:57 - Whiteboard with all these game ideas you
67:59 - have to be both if you want to succeed
68:02 - if if you want to succeed if you want to
68:04 - do it as a hobby you can do whatever you
68:05 - want but yeah I find that to be like the
68:07 - biggest thing that a lot of my game of
68:09 - offer friends fail to realize is that as
68:12 - much as this is an art medium and like
68:14 - we want to use it for artistic means
68:17 - what is art if no one ever engages with
68:19 - it you
68:21 - know yeah and I mean there are probably
68:23 - lots of people who think oh maybe some
68:25 - like historian is going to appreciate
68:28 - you know my game the way that van Go's
68:30 - art was only appreciated after he shot
68:32 - himself in the chest with a revolver and
68:34 - like years had passed and people just oh
68:36 - who's this V go guy right like but that
68:39 - is extremely unlikely for every van go
68:42 - there's
68:43 - probably thousands tens of thousands
68:46 - hundreds of thousands of artists who
68:48 - just died in obscurity and are still
68:50 - obscure right so it's a dice roll yeah
68:52 - so so I mean uh sounds like you've taken
68:55 - a very pragmatic approach toward game
68:58 - development
68:59 - um one thing that I want to talk about
69:01 - is distribution so we talked about like
69:03 - um the role of you know Tik Tok YouTube
69:06 - shorts Instagram
69:08 - reals there's this saying that like
69:10 - firsttime Founders focus on technology
69:13 - second time Founders focus on
69:15 - distribution how how do you distribute
69:19 - your game how do you get it in front of
69:20 - people obviously you talked about short
69:22 - firm video but but like what are the
69:24 - other ways that you distribute your game
69:27 - and like like are you using App Stores
69:29 - are you um do you have a mailing list
69:32 - are you like how do you get it your game
69:34 - out there and get people playing it I
69:36 - think I've came to a realization not too
69:37 - long ago that all of my games moving
69:40 - forward are going to be on the App
69:42 - Store and this is Apple and and Google
69:45 - App Store correct correct and the reason
69:49 - why is
69:50 - [Music]
69:52 - because it just matches so much with
69:56 - kind of my business model as it already
69:58 - is like a lot of people come to my
70:00 - YouTube channel and they watch my videos
70:01 - for free and then you know a small
70:04 - percentage they'll donate or they'll buy
70:05 - merch right but the majority in whole
70:08 - they expect free
70:10 - content
70:12 - and this is what the app stores are
70:17 - predominantly operated on it's like free
70:19 - apps and so I found that it's just a
70:22 - good fit where if I make free videos and
70:25 - I I I'm really lucky that I have an
70:27 - audience that I can make content for
70:29 - right like I have my own audience that I
70:31 - can show ads to I don't have to pay
70:33 - anyone right right which I'll get into
70:36 - that a little bit but in a little bit
70:40 - but just to wrap this Sor I have so
70:42 - many put all together I'm excited I'm
70:44 - taking
70:45 - notes um so so so again so the business
70:49 - model I've been operating on for a long
70:50 - time is free videos is what people
70:51 - expect so it only makes sense that like
70:53 - hey here's a free video also here's a
70:55 - free app that you can play in the
70:56 - meantime while you wait for the next
70:58 - video right and the reason why I think
71:02 - that the App Store themselves are good
71:04 - is because they promote apps based on
71:07 - their
71:08 - performance of people playing it of
71:11 - people downloading it Etc versus you
71:13 - look at some other stores like Steam for
71:14 - example they promote apps based on how
71:17 - they
71:18 - sell you see so there's a bit of a
71:20 - disconnect on my current business model
71:24 - and how Steam Works
71:26 - not saying it's impossible to make a
71:27 - successful game um from your YouTube
71:30 - audience but it just makes more sense
71:31 - that I have a free app that I can send
71:35 - my audience to and funneling traffic to
71:41 - my
71:42 - app is measured uh is is a key
71:45 - performance indicator for these app
71:47 - stores to then push it even further so
71:49 - it's just like extra boost if you will
71:50 - okay interesting so so essentially
71:52 - external traffic to an app uh will give
71:55 - like like Google's app store or Apple's
71:58 - App Store and their like top app
72:00 - leaderboard of the week and all that
72:01 - stuff like you can get a lot of
72:03 - additional juice out of like maybe the
72:05 - same number of people just because of
72:07 - the type of traffic that's coming to the
72:10 - app and if it's external that's
72:12 - interesting to note okay yeah I didn't
72:14 - know that and and the thing is like I
72:15 - don't even need someone to play the game
72:17 - more than an hour you know all I need is
72:19 - the download and then the app stores
72:20 - pick that up and they say okay there's
72:22 - some interest here we're going to
72:23 - promote this to people who don't even
72:24 - know who J Bros is
72:25 - you know yeah you say more than an hour
72:28 - because steam you you can get a refund
72:31 - if you play it less than a certain
72:32 - amount of time right so a lot of people
72:33 - refund it yeah yeah sorry I didn't mean
72:35 - to interrupt your flow they can well
72:37 - well I mean look that's actually another
72:38 - good point as well right like I think
72:40 - it's eight hours if you play before 8
72:43 - hours you get a refund which means that
72:45 - you have to create a game that has more
72:47 - than eight hours of content which is not
72:50 - easy you know and if you're you're if
72:54 - you're a full-time content
72:56 - Creator and you're trying to launch a
72:59 - game on Steam you need to make a game
73:01 - that has more than eight hours of
73:03 - confident so that people don't game the
73:05 - system and get their money back right
73:06 - you
73:08 - know again I'm not saying that it's bad
73:10 - I'm not saying launching games on steams
73:11 - is bad I just think that launching games
73:13 - on in app store is just far more optimal
73:16 - for the business model of a content
73:17 - creator uh like a YouTube content
73:19 - creator yeah interesting so uh not to
73:23 - mention the accessibility as well yeah
73:25 - accessibility one thing I learned one
73:27 - thing I learned transitioning to doing
73:29 - mobile apps is how simple it is for
73:31 - people to play the app I used to do
73:34 - Steam games and there would be so many
73:36 - different things oh I need a coordinate
73:37 - a time oh is it is it this system or
73:40 - that system oh my PC specs aren't good
73:42 - enough right when I've been doing mobile
73:44 - apps I've doing play testing I say hey
73:46 - here's the app link in three minutes
73:48 - they have it downloaded ready to play I
73:50 - mean you've even done some live streams
73:51 - where you're like here download this app
73:52 - and like let's play it and like those
73:54 - streams are great like your who's the AI
73:56 - game I can't remember the exact name
73:58 - yeah yeah where you got like video
73:59 - coming soon yeah so different um
74:04 - different ideas like that you can
74:06 - iterate on them so quickly and your
74:08 - audience can get into the game and once
74:09 - they've played one game that like breaks
74:11 - a barrier where they're like okay next
74:13 - time he's doing a live stream I'm going
74:14 - to download the game and interact right
74:15 - there these multiplayer games so cool so
74:19 - uh let's say hypothetically you didn't
74:20 - have the uh YouTube following that you
74:24 - have how would you dist your game would
74:25 - you still stick mostly to the App
74:28 - Stores yeah I think app stores is the
74:32 - best way to go in terms of
74:34 - someone I don't know I I'm still
74:36 - thinking about like app stores versus
74:39 - steam yeah like this is a relatively new
74:41 - discovery for me I'm still thinking
74:42 - about it but at this moment I feel that
74:45 - app stores are they are the future there
74:48 - are limitations you can't really create
74:50 - every experience with an app but I think
74:52 - you can create most experiences with an
74:54 - app and and the reason why I would
74:57 - suggest someone who doesn't have an
74:58 - audience to use an app store is because
75:00 - you have a greater probability of
75:02 - getting promoted with on the App Stores
75:06 - literally the the key performance
75:08 - indicator for steam is sales yeah so if
75:11 - you don't have an audience already you
75:13 - make a game you put up on Steam and you
75:15 - don't get any sales you're just not
75:16 - going to get seen yeah but if you can if
75:20 - you publish an app on Google Play or the
75:22 - app store or the Apple App Store and you
75:24 - create a Tik Tok or something and the
75:26 - Tik Tok gets some traction and you get
75:28 - people to go download your game that is
75:29 - a key performance indicator that will be
75:31 - looked at and you will get extra
75:32 - promotion so it it just makes sense you
75:35 - know yeah okay I think yeah that's
75:36 - really that explains why a lot of the
75:37 - most Innovative games I've seen are on
75:39 - mobile formats even though a lot of
75:42 - Hardcore Gamers cringe and bristle at
75:44 - the notion of playing a game on their
75:45 - phone when they've got like you know a
75:47 - $2,000 PC with like a fancy graphics
75:49 - card and they got like all their
75:50 - ergonomic stuff set up at their desk so
75:54 - moving on from distribution I want to
75:56 - talk about like game design as a field
76:00 - and one of the things that's so
76:01 - interesting to me is like the games
76:03 - you're developing are very different
76:05 - from other games uh like almost like
76:09 - genre Less in a way or like if there is
76:11 - a genre it's very you know specific like
76:14 - I we we saw the rise of lots of
76:16 - different genres of games such as like
76:18 - Tower Defense games for example or um
76:22 - you know like obviously realtime
76:23 - strategy games have been around for long
76:24 - a long time but before video games
76:27 - reached a certain level of
76:28 - sophistication the notion of a real-time
76:30 - strategy game where you controlled a
76:31 - whole lot of different units and a whole
76:33 - lot you were like making so many
76:34 - decisions like that had to come from
76:37 - somewhere right first-person shooters uh
76:39 - like like Doom had to come from
76:41 - somewhere and they came from the idea of
76:44 - from the mind of a few developers
76:46 - probably sketching things out on
76:47 - whiteboards probably building really
76:49 - coarse prototypes right even sides
76:51 - scrollers like the original rcade games
76:54 - had the strength that they couldn't
76:55 - scroll because it was too graphically
76:57 - intensive now you can I mean I want to
77:00 - say you can do basically anything with
77:02 - the computational power of like an
77:03 - iPhone or an Android like do you think
77:06 - we'll ever exhaust the design space for
77:09 - games and interactive
77:12 - experiences no I don't think
77:16 - so I so there's a game that came out not
77:19 - too long ago
77:21 - it's um I don't remember the name of it
77:25 - but it it meshes two genres together two
77:27 - relatively new genres together
77:30 - and even that I'm like we're never going
77:34 - to run out of ideas like there there's
77:36 - so many genres that you can take to this
77:38 - day and and just do one plus one and get
77:40 - two like to this day there's so much
77:42 - unexplored and we we are still creating
77:45 - new genres as the years go on so I don't
77:48 - think that we will you know you yeah I I
77:51 - can go on but I'll stop there okay and
77:53 - like so how do you how did you come up
77:55 - with the idea of having a turn-based
77:58 - fighting game cuz of course there's like
78:01 - Pokemon there are lots of like
78:02 - collectible card games and stuff like
78:03 - that there are lots of games that are
78:05 - turn-based uh like board games basically
78:07 - anything in the tabletop world is
78:09 - necessarily almost turn-based just
78:10 - because otherwise you'd have people like
78:12 - throwing their hands all over the table
78:14 - and stuff yeah how did you come up with
78:17 - this particular idea because people
78:18 - think about you know Tekken they think
78:19 - about Street Fighter they think about
78:21 - games that uh require like frame perfect
78:24 - inputs and stuff like that like what
78:26 - inspired you to go on this this route
78:29 - thank you for asking this
78:31 - question I have immense passion for uh
78:35 - this game this turn based fighting game
78:37 - then I'm making Ultra BS uh because it
78:40 - it mixes everything that I've kind of
78:43 - learned over the last like 15 years in
78:46 - the sense of design and the sense of
78:48 - code and sense of so many different
78:50 - things Graphics Etc but the to answer a
78:52 - question directly I've always been a
78:54 - huge fan of
78:55 - anime and I've played many anime games
78:58 - over the years but I've never been
79:00 - really satisfied with the anime games
79:02 - that I play because you watch like Goku
79:05 - versus Vegeta right in Dragon Ball Z and
79:08 - you see them doing some incredible
79:11 - things that you just wish you could do
79:13 - but then you go play a game and they
79:15 - have to limit you because you're playing
79:17 - a game in real time with the controller
79:19 - with a limited amount of inputs
79:22 - right and so having the desire to want
79:26 - to like really feel like
79:29 - Goku but also uh coming off of a chess
79:32 - addiction that I had
79:35 - yeah I realized that and I I I'm still
79:38 - exploring this Beyond Ultra bers I
79:40 - realized
79:42 - that I think that some of the the
79:45 - greatest experiences we have yet to
79:48 - experience are ditching real time
79:52 - simulation and inste in in favor of like
79:55 - a like a turn base or a frame by frame
79:57 - simulation yeah and frame by frame maybe
79:59 - you can describe verbally like so you're
80:01 - doing like a show ruken or something and
80:03 - it's like frame by frame it's like okay
80:06 - what would you like to do at this step
80:07 - like and so you can alter like you know
80:10 - all different aspects of like the combat
80:13 - experience and you can kind of adapt to
80:15 - strategies it presents like this
80:17 - multifaceted whereas like okay I threw a
80:20 - punch and they threw a punch and my
80:21 - punch has higher priority or my punch
80:23 - comes out in eight frames they're comes
80:24 - out in 10 frames so I win and then they
80:27 - there's nothing they can do once that
80:29 - button's been pressed and so many
80:31 - decisions in these you know real- time
80:33 - fighting games like fighting games
80:35 - because they're all real time basically
80:37 - like they happen at like a the level
80:39 - like the human threshold for reaction
80:41 - time I think is like a quarter of a
80:43 - second right like if you have like you
80:44 - go to the Science Museum and they've got
80:46 - the the magnet thing and it holds the
80:47 - ruler and it drops it and you have to
80:49 - grab it and it like I tried it so many
80:51 - times I could never really get below the
80:53 - quarter of a second threshold M the
80:56 - games happen faster so you have to kind
80:58 - of like input and you have to come up
80:59 - with humanistics like oh I'm going to
81:01 - throw this and this and you kind of
81:03 - develop an intuition but you can't
81:04 - actually react to what's happening it's
81:06 - right it's kind of physiologically
81:08 - impossible to really react you know you
81:11 - you might be able to memorize exactly
81:12 - how to Parry you know like Chun ley's
81:15 - special or something like that to where
81:16 - you can Parry every single hit of it or
81:18 - something like that right but you're not
81:20 - going to be able to uh adapt your
81:23 - gameplay in real time and it sounds like
81:25 - what you're building gives you the
81:26 - opportunity to consider all those things
81:28 - and and it lets you step back and
81:30 - deliberate like a real time chess
81:32 - experience would be extremely boring
81:34 - watching two grand Masters sit at the
81:37 - table and think really hard for 15
81:39 - minutes and make a move right like the
81:40 - chess clocks are like nine hours in some
81:42 - games right yeah but at the same time
81:45 - it's incredibly engaging if you're the
81:47 - person who's at the chest table looking
81:49 - at the game trying to decide what to
81:51 - do yeah also replays I I was really
81:54 - addicted to watching chess replays
81:56 - there's uh I think Gotham chess he does
81:58 - like his YouTube channel does a bunch of
82:00 - uh replay commentary on like really
82:03 - famous matches and it was so enthralling
82:04 - to me but I I realized that it's not
82:07 - going to be enthralling to everyone like
82:09 - you have to have an understanding of
82:10 - Chess to some degree and you know it's
82:12 - really plain Graphics um yeah there's so
82:15 - many things that came together for the
82:17 - ultra BS project I remember I was going
82:18 - to do a video a few years ago about um a
82:22 - concept in The Matrix right so you think
82:24 - about the Matrix
82:25 - you think what what would it take if we
82:27 - had the ability to dodge bullets right
82:30 - and the truth of the matter is you just
82:32 - would have to have a much
82:35 - uh a
82:37 - much larger iteration of time uh
82:41 - perception right in terms of like one
82:44 - yeah like one second you need to be able
82:46 - to perceive much faster right and I was
82:49 - going to make this video where you could
82:52 - put on a VR and and you would get shot
82:56 - by an
82:57 - agent and then I would calculate the
82:59 - trajectory that it's going and then just
83:02 - skip the time so that it puts it right
83:05 - in front of you so you get to react to
83:06 - it but then the the person who shot the
83:08 - gun sees you dodging it so yeah so they
83:12 - they can quickly adapt to where you are
83:13 - and like triangulate where they think
83:15 - you're going to go and shoot in that
83:16 - direction we're talking about the 1990 n
83:19 - classic The Matrix if anybody listening
83:21 - to this has not seen that movie I I mean
83:23 - it is literally my favorite movie I'm
83:26 - not exaggerating I've watched lots of
83:27 - movies I I think it's the most creative
83:31 - interesting like it holds up really well
83:34 - uh even today in 2024 but but sorry for
83:37 - the the segue like and the plot is
83:39 - surprisingly deep if you watch the
83:41 - entire Trilogy are the machines actually
83:43 - bad think about it you know U but uh but
83:47 - to get to your point like the the
83:49 - ability to adapt and then have your
83:51 - opponent adapt and like there there's
83:54 - there also kind of like the metag gaming
83:55 - like conventionally people will do this
83:57 - so like they can recognize the strategy
83:59 - and they can develop heuristics to be
84:00 - able to make decisions again the sort of
84:03 - stuff that like maybe an extremely high
84:05 - level fighting game player already does
84:08 - but they do it almost intuitively after
84:10 - thousands of hours of practice what if
84:11 - you just picking up this game could
84:14 - start to have that that kind of push and
84:15 - pull that interplay that's the exact
84:18 - point of ultra bers is you no longer
84:21 - need that thousand hours like here we're
84:23 - going to give it to you step by step so
84:25 - you can you can take all the time you
84:27 - need to evaluate the game State yeah you
84:29 - know yeah it sounds so cool man and uh
84:32 - you mentioned anime I'm just going to
84:34 - jump to that man like what inspired you
84:36 - a game developer to create anime to
84:40 - Japanese animation style uh you know
84:43 - cartoons
84:45 - essentially
84:47 - uh that's great question I I personally
84:49 - think that a lot of the best stories
84:52 - come from anime um
84:56 - I can't like I think a lot of the
84:58 - stories that have resonated with me to
85:00 - this day are like all anime stories from
85:02 - Cowboy bbop to to Big O to Dragon Ball
85:06 - like they're all anime stories and
85:10 - I came to a point where I wanted to tell
85:12 - my own story and I thought what better
85:15 - medium than to create a create an anime
85:17 - it's still in in progress It's in manga
85:20 - form at the moment but we we'll get to
85:21 - it eventually awesome corre you hiring
85:23 - to develop the you're actually artist
85:25 - and I took this the tofu car that is
85:28 - like the star of the uh of the show and
85:31 - I just was like Hey can you can you do
85:32 - something similar about me holding my
85:34 - bass playing like kind of like leaning
85:36 - against the car so that's the cover of
85:38 - the uh the uh learn to code RPG
85:40 - soundtrack thing but um nice nice but
85:43 - I've worked with artists and they're not
85:45 - that expensive at least the ones like
85:47 - it's amazing like uh you you can find
85:50 - artists who really take pride in their
85:52 - craft you can support them in their
85:54 - craft and you can get them to uh
85:57 - essentially develop art based on your
86:00 - prompt if you will like you've been
86:02 - doing that right you've been working
86:03 - with artists correct correct and it's
86:07 - been quite the journey I um you know
86:11 - before I did any of this I was like yeah
86:12 - usually I just go and tell someone who I
86:15 - think is talented to make some art and
86:17 - they do it but yeah you know they're
86:19 - individuals they're also entrepreneurs
86:21 - you know they have their own schedules
86:23 - and timelines and projects and dreams
86:25 - and aspirations and you know some are
86:27 - better than others unfortunately but I
86:30 - am lucky to have found a good group of
86:32 - artists that I am able to work really
86:35 - well with and they do really talented
86:37 - work
86:38 - and learned a lot yeah so you so you
86:40 - write and you come up with the
86:41 - characters and kind of like figure out
86:43 - what's correct what you want to relay to
86:47 - to the reader or eventually the viewer
86:49 - and then they help you execute on that
86:51 - through their skills correct correct I
86:54 - do all the writing character design all
86:56 - that stuff and uh there's a bit of a
86:58 - compromise you know when you when you
87:00 - bring anyone on any project right like
87:02 - they have their own fair share of say
87:05 - into the content just by the nature of
87:07 - their art style and the way they
87:09 - interpret things but you know it's part
87:12 - of the collaborative process so I I
87:13 - don't mind it so how would you how would
87:15 - you compare working with human artists
87:17 - to working with you know Frameworks that
87:20 - you're developing games on and stuff
87:21 - because as a as an indie Dev you're kind
87:23 - of like
87:24 - doing everything Soup To Nuts Lock Stock
87:26 - and Barrel right like you're you you're
87:29 - kind of doing I don't know if you
87:30 - actually develop your own assets but
87:32 - like maybe you could talk about like
87:35 - just how many different hats you wear
87:38 - when you're building a game versus you
87:40 - know collaborating with humans for
87:43 - art it's it's a lesson that I'm learning
87:47 - uh how to do
87:48 - less wear less of the hats
87:51 - yeah um once upon a time I I had this
87:54 - belief that you not a real creative if
87:57 - you didn't do the whole thing
87:59 - yourself once upon a time I believe that
88:01 - but I have I think actually thanks to
88:04 - the manga project and working with
88:06 - artists because I had no other option to
88:08 - because I can't draw it is taught me a
88:10 - lot of it has showed me like the value
88:14 - of working with people and so Ultra bout
88:16 - is actually it has I have a 3D modeler
88:18 - shout outs to my boy colossal cake he's
88:20 - doing the 3D models on that they look
88:22 - beautiful far better than anything I
88:23 - could ever do
88:26 - and I sorry I forgot the question you
88:28 - said oh yeah like what hats would you
88:30 - wear as a Game Dev versus now you're
88:32 - just writing and kind of directing I
88:34 - guess yeah yeah back then it's
88:37 - everything design it's code it's art
88:39 - it's sound it's music it's it's writing
88:42 - it's it's everything you know character
88:43 - design it's it's everything and I and
88:47 - you know what's interesting is that I
88:49 - think that's part of the reason why
88:51 - scope is so difficult is because like
88:54 - you have to do everything and and now
88:56 - that I've relinquished the art to an
88:58 - artist colossal cake for Ultra bers
89:00 - that's just one less thing that I have
89:01 - to worry about right so now I can I have
89:04 - this I have this uh like this this group
89:08 - of things that is like a
89:10 - little less heavy with the art remove
89:13 - that I can put more time into and help
89:17 - me scope things correctly awesome well I
89:19 - want to talk a little bit about AI
89:22 - That's like the thing that everybody
89:23 - talks about now uh there have been some
89:25 - really impressive advancements in AI
89:28 - recently we saw like Sora which is this
89:31 - uh um video creation tool put up by open
89:35 - AI um and of course we've got like image
89:38 - creation tools uh and we've got text
89:41 - creation tools you've used AI in a lot
89:44 - of your recent projects um let's talk a
89:47 - little bit about your relationship with
89:48 - AI and how you got how you like looked
89:51 - at it like this is ready for me to
89:53 - actually use it right because it's been
89:56 - around forever you know lots of people
89:58 - have developed things with AI over the
89:59 - past few years I mean you could argue
90:01 - that like game AI is as old as games
90:03 - themselves because otherwise there
90:05 - wouldn't be much of a game if the
90:07 - Pac-Man ghost just sat there right like
90:09 - yeah but what inspired you to pick up Ai
90:13 - and what are some of the things you've
90:15 - been building with
90:16 - it what inspired me to pick up AI once
90:19 - again this is a call back to the
90:20 - beginning of the podcast um I used to
90:22 - watch my mom play D Kong Country on
90:24 - Super Nintendo when I was young and
90:26 - again she had a controller and she was
90:28 - controlling Donkey Kong but there were
90:30 - agents that I I just was like who's
90:32 - controlling the agents who who who is
90:34 - controlling the the enemies the baddies
90:36 - and that like I think started my
90:38 - fascination with AI and wanting to learn
90:40 - more um so I get the game maker and I'm
90:43 - making a bunch of games and I'm learning
90:44 - how to do AI for the first time and once
90:48 - I learned how to do it well man I made
90:50 - so many games that like couldn't even
90:52 - play like I just said and watched it I
90:55 - had this one game quick side note that I
90:57 - made that was like anime shown in style
91:00 - bunch of Fighters they're in like an
91:01 - arena and I would just put it on and
91:03 - watch it as I fall
91:05 - asleep anyways that's cool I I
91:09 - eventually come across um Carl Sims um
91:12 - Evolution simulator uh demo thing and
91:15 - that really changed like my whole
91:17 - concept of what AI could be with their
91:19 - generative algorithm they was
91:20 - demonstrating obviously I had no idea
91:22 - how to do at the time but but that stuck
91:24 - in my brain for many many many many many
91:26 - years until finally I found unity and
91:30 - there's all these announcements about
91:32 - tensor flow you know which is a machine
91:34 - learning library yeah yeah and um uh now
91:39 - all of a sudden all these resources are
91:41 - available where I can learn back
91:42 - propagation and the various calculus
91:44 - things that I need and I spent eight
91:46 - months to learn all that stuff and then
91:48 - I make I basically try and make what
91:51 - Carl Sims made in his 1990 one demo I
91:54 - think it is um on YouTube and it worked
91:57 - it blew up
91:59 - and I've always had a Fascination for AI
92:02 - awesome I'll track down that Carl Sims
92:04 - demo and put it in the show notes for
92:06 - anybody who wants to watch it let's talk
92:08 - about some of the things you've built
92:09 - with it like I can't not talk about the
92:11 - amazing shark tank Shark Tank Episode
92:15 - generator uh this I was laughing like
92:19 - like practically rolling on the floor
92:21 - watching the video where you demoed some
92:22 - of it and and it's just the the show
92:25 - shark tank is so absurd for anybody who
92:27 - knows anything about business like even
92:29 - ad me administering a charity like the
92:31 - show is so absurd and ridiculous and
92:33 - it's not how real people invest the
92:35 - business advice
92:37 - like there might be some useful advice
92:39 - in there but it's it's hyper real
92:42 - reality TV right yeah so now imagine
92:45 - people are coming in with straight faces
92:47 - pitching things like underwear
92:49 - underwater shops for fish to shop at um
92:53 - I'm trying to remember some of the other
92:55 - ones but baby's first hand gun you know
92:58 - to absurd but they're coming in their
93:01 - they're do they're silent fire alarm
93:03 - yeah silent fire alarm like isn't it
93:05 - annoying when a fire alarm goes off
93:06 - silent fire alarm you know like pitching
93:08 - it as a product and having like the you
93:10 - know the cast of uh the Sharks I guess
93:12 - is what they're called like reacting to
93:14 - it like oh I'm out you know the
93:17 - cigarette that has 10x the nicotine or
93:20 - something like that yeah yeah like you
93:22 - you don't have to smoke as much cuz you
93:23 - get next ni easier on the ls right I
93:26 - mean and then uh I mean it sounds like
93:28 - something that would have been pitched
93:29 - at like the height of the ' 80s or
93:30 - something like that like but these are
93:33 - really amazing scripts and you've even
93:36 - kind of figured out like some rigging so
93:37 - that you can have like it a visual
93:39 - element to it like the the shark sitting
93:41 - back in their chair like their lips are
93:42 - moving as they talk and and the voices
93:44 - like GPT has probably read the
93:46 - transcripts of every single Shark Tank
93:47 - Episode ever so it can kind of almost
93:49 - nail the manner in which the Sharks
93:51 - would react to a given proposal if they
93:54 - were entertaining is is a serious
93:55 - proposal which none of these are yeah
93:57 - maybe you can talk about developing that
93:59 - and like what inspired you to develop
94:02 - that yeah I um I love shark tank it's a
94:06 - very entertaining show incredibly
94:07 - entertaining but you know kind of like
94:10 - what I touched on the video the best
94:11 - episodes of Shark Tank are the bad ideas
94:14 - those are always the most entertaining
94:16 - and it just came to me one day I was
94:18 - like well I want more Shark Tank
94:21 - episodes of bad ideas and I think we can
94:24 - make this happen with AI I think someone
94:26 - had asked me when I was talking to them
94:28 - about it like what if someone
94:30 - pitched it was some crazy idea and I was
94:33 - like that would be so funny and I think
94:35 - the initial idea was to just do it
94:36 - myself and I was like no no no we can
94:38 - make an AI algorithm to do this for us
94:40 - and so I started to develop
94:42 - it and funny enough I was actually going
94:44 - to stop at the 3D
94:46 - rendering but I remember showing it to
94:48 - someone they're like oh yeah this is
94:50 - cool I was like no what do you mean this
94:52 - is cool this is this is amazing
94:54 - and what I what I had figured out is
94:57 - that the idea itself was cool but the
94:59 - presentation was terrible in the video
95:01 - there's like a 3D model of the Sharks
95:04 - and it's like whatever presentation and
95:06 - so that's when I learned that like I
95:08 - need to take it further and so I got a
95:11 - bunch of different libraries to make
95:12 - them like the face driving and whatnot
95:14 - and then I showed that to the same
95:15 - person like oh I love this is amazing I
95:17 - want to see more right so rapidly
95:19 - iterating essentially uh as you got
95:22 - feedback and just thinking like hey I
95:24 - could use AI for this I'm sure a lot of
95:26 - developers are kind of like working on
95:28 - things and they're like wait a second I
95:29 - need to generate a whole lot of scripts
95:31 - and I don't want if I write them myself
95:32 - they probably won't be as funny as what
95:33 - GPT creates anyway yeah um because again
95:36 - it's read everything it's read every
95:38 - Reddit post it's read every book in the
95:41 - Library of Congress like it has the
95:42 - context to be able to come up with stuff
95:44 - and it's very useful in that regard so
95:47 - maybe we could talk a little bit about
95:50 - um Ai and what what you think is likely
95:54 - to disrupt you did a recent kind of tier
95:57 - list of jobs you think are likely to be
95:58 - disrupted by Ai and very controversial
96:02 - yeah yeah I'm sure it's controversial
96:03 - because I think a lot of people greatly
96:05 - overestimate the capability of AI and
96:08 - they see like this big step change and
96:09 - they think that like oh the next big
96:11 - step change is just around the corner
96:12 - and then next thing you know we're in
96:14 - like you know lawnmower man or something
96:16 - I don't know but maybe you could talk
96:18 - about like um your tier list and like
96:22 - EXC where you put different jobs and
96:24 - then what proved to be the most
96:28 - controversial all of it all of it's
96:30 - controversial apparently
96:33 - um yeah I I don't remember specifically
96:37 - a lot of them to be honest but I I do
96:39 - know that I got a comment like an hour
96:41 - ago of someone talking about how
96:42 - delusional I am thinking that factory
96:45 - workers won't be
96:46 - replaced and so I I replied to them and
96:49 - say okay just to make sure I understand
96:51 - what you're saying you're saying that
96:53 - the
96:54 - 200,000 Factory workers who work on the
96:56 - iPhone are going to be replaced within 5
96:57 - 10 years and then his reply was like
97:00 - well I think about 180,000 of them are
97:02 - going to be replaced in 51 years I'm
97:03 - just like how do we get here yeah how do
97:06 - we get here that is an absurd claim 51
97:09 - years 180,000 Factory workers will be
97:12 - replaced to make an iPhone like that
97:16 - that is so absurd yeah that is so absurd
97:18 - like when we get into like the actual
97:20 - economics of it it's like how much does
97:21 - that cost I was lucky enough I did a
97:23 - tour uh of one of Amazon's robot
97:26 - facilities and Amazon I think they have
97:29 - like a $ 1.6 trillion do market cap or
97:31 - something like that and they were
97:32 - showing us Rob robots that were in
97:35 - beta you know and this person is talking
97:37 - about we replace 180 it's just it's just
97:40 - crazy to me I don't know I don't I I I
97:42 - have an idea how we got here sci-fi is
97:44 - really appealing and you know oftentimes
97:47 - we don't even think too deeply about
97:48 - like the economics and actual effects of
97:50 - these things but you know yeah it is
97:52 - what it is I guess
97:55 - so do you think people greatly
97:57 - overestimate like like the the most
97:59 - common thing I hear the most common
98:00 - question I get an email about it people
98:02 - who've listened to more than one episode
98:03 - of the freeo camp podcast will no doubt
98:05 - be like oh quiz's going to talk about it
98:07 - again but I am because it's important
98:09 - people write me every single day hey
98:10 - should I still learn the code or is my
98:12 - job going to be completely automated and
98:15 - uh yeah what what would you say to to
98:17 - some whipper snapper who's like jail
98:20 - should I still learn Game Dev or is Game
98:21 - Dev just going to be automated in 5
98:23 - years
98:26 - um so I I do think that there is a
98:30 - probability that it will be automated at
98:32 - some point I think 51 years is too short
98:35 - of a time
98:36 - scale um I can get into why but before I
98:39 - do that before I do that I I again I
98:44 - always like to like ground these things
98:47 - and economics right if I am going to go
98:51 - make the next Facebook or what they call
98:54 - it meta or whatever they call
98:56 - it and I want to hire an AI to do my to
98:59 - be my full-time programmer right the
99:02 - real question is how much does that cost
99:04 - in API Keys like how much does it cost
99:08 - right now if I want a full team of AI
99:11 - programmers how much does that cost like
99:13 - these are real questions that we need to
99:14 - ask right and then furthermore right we
99:17 - can keep going if an AI um programmer
99:21 - makes a mistake like a fund Al
99:23 - foundational mistake within the code and
99:26 - doesn't report it who do we blame you
99:29 - know like there's so many questions that
99:31 - we need to explore that I think that
99:33 - we're so far away especially someone
99:35 - that's been working with these tools uh
99:37 - on a daily basis building actual
99:39 - products with it there's so many
99:40 - foundational errors not saying it can't
99:42 - get better but I I I think that there's
99:46 - an element
99:48 - of language that we as humans don't even
99:52 - understand
99:54 - and to
99:58 - see the
100:00 - um to see that understanding uh being
100:03 - implemented in these AI language models
100:06 - within the next 5 10 years when we don't
100:08 - even understand it I think it's a little
100:10 - absurd but yeah and what I think are the
100:14 - things that you've been most impressed
100:15 - by with tools like gbd4 that that you're
100:19 - like oh this is genuinely useful and
100:21 - this saved me a whole lot of time
100:24 - yeah don't get me wrong I think GPT Chad
100:27 - GPT is like one of the most foundational
100:29 - like amazing products of the last 30
100:32 - years I think it's amazing however I
100:35 - just always like to push back on like
100:37 - you guys think the show like it's it's
100:38 - it's not going to do all that the things
100:40 - that you think it's going to do at least
100:42 - not right now um but in terms of like
100:45 - what I use it for I use it for virtually
100:47 - everything man if I'm making a video I
100:48 - go asking for some advice uh if I am
100:52 - working on a game feature I'll ask it
100:54 - for advice or even code um if I'm having
100:57 - problems my relationship I'll ask for
100:59 - advice if there's some news article I'll
101:01 - say hey can you summarize this formula I
101:02 - use it for almost everything to be
101:04 - honest with you yeah and it improves
101:05 - your productivity your personal
101:06 - productivity and I think that's one of
101:08 - the things you struck at in the the
101:10 - video is it's going to improve the
101:12 - productivity of lawyers but it's not
101:14 - going to replace lawyers heaven forbid
101:17 - we have you I mean I can only imagine
101:20 - like all the you know lawsuits and all
101:22 - all the economic waste that would come
101:24 - from delegating that when you could just
101:26 - hire a lawyer who yes they're expensive
101:28 - but these are important decisions right
101:30 - um yeah yeah so very important to yeah
101:33 - and and I would say like you know a
101:35 - doctor a lawyer like I don't think that
101:37 - those jobs are like and I think software
101:39 - engineer is also in that category
101:40 - because software engineer makes a
101:41 - mistake and a plane falls out of the sky
101:44 - you know like yeah you're going to want
101:46 - actual people working on some of those
101:47 - things I guess the the main question I
101:49 - have for you is are the fields not
101:52 - complete replacement which was what your
101:53 - video was about but do you think that an
101:56 - individual developer could become so
101:59 - productive by leveraging all these tools
102:01 - that you just need fewer
102:04 - developers yeah I think that's
102:05 - definitely possible and I I would be
102:07 - surprised if it's not already happening
102:08 - to be honest um but I mean but I the
102:12 - question I always have is like what is
102:13 - that what is that saying and what are
102:16 - you trying to say not you personally
102:17 - coinci but like someone who make puts
102:19 - forward this argument are you saying
102:20 - that we should stop AI technology
102:22 - because it makes people more productive
102:24 - like that's not in the human Spirit you
102:26 - know we for a millennia have been
102:29 - creating tools to further our production
102:32 - right um I personally find arguments
102:35 - like that when we talk about
102:37 - displacement right instead of
102:39 - replacement I find that to be very
102:42 - telling on like the individual you know
102:45 - learn these tools man they're not that
102:47 - difficult you know yeah I mean in in my
102:49 - opinion tools are getting easier to
102:51 - learn every day like it's getting easier
102:52 - and easier to learn how to code for
102:54 - example to learn how to be a database
102:56 - administrator to learn how to do devops
102:59 - um yeah the tools are improving so I
103:01 - just want to wrap up with a few quick
103:03 - questions uh that I'm excited to ask you
103:07 - are you like inspired by like Hong Kong
103:09 - Kung Fu dubbing or something like why is
103:11 - it so many of your videos you're like
103:14 - hey how's it going you know like I love
103:17 - that it's so funny and I I I haven't
103:19 - seen any other creators do that is that
103:20 - common am I just missing out on like a
103:22 - genre of you know videos or is that
103:25 - distinctly
103:27 - you um I don't think I've came across
103:30 - any other creators that do that so just
103:31 - to describe it like verbally for for
103:34 - people that aren't watching the video
103:37 - like when you watch a ja video he'll be
103:40 - like eating pizza and like his voice
103:42 - sounds totally clear it doesn't sound
103:44 - like he's eating pizza but he's
103:45 - obviously eating pizza and like doing
103:47 - these very exaggerated movements and
103:49 - stuff it's so Charming uh and it's so
103:53 - there's like this weird kind of
103:54 - Disconnect but like I'm watching jabril
103:56 - but I'm not you know I'm listening to a
103:58 - different jbril like in a different time
104:00 - why doesn't he sync it up it it also
104:02 - seems like a huge time save because you
104:03 - can just just gesticulate and do
104:05 - whatever and then you can have that
104:06 - almost as like b-roll from when you're
104:08 - actually recording your fil your videos
104:10 - right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's yeah
104:14 - so the the inspiration for it before I
104:17 - used to make my videos uh like reading
104:20 - scripts like I would dead pan just read
104:22 - a script but it took so much time it
104:24 - took a lot of time retaking and I don't
104:27 - say a word properly and one day I was
104:30 - watching a video it was like some kid he
104:32 - was doing like a commentary with
104:34 - gameplay footage on screen I was like
104:37 - this is so brain dead simple why can't I
104:40 - do this I like wait I can do this you
104:43 - know except for I'm Just a Little More
104:45 - egotistical I need my face on screen so
104:47 - I just use my face in lie of the
104:50 - gameplay footage um but I don't do that
104:53 - anymore unfortunately it it it got to a
104:57 - point
104:58 - where it was like a highlight for a lot
105:01 - of people to the point where like I'm
105:03 - overthinking so many takes and it ended
105:06 - up taking a lot more time than it used
105:07 - to so I kind of I found a new way that's
105:10 - faster to make videos yeah I get
105:12 - comments every single day what's your
105:13 - new faster way just out of
105:15 - curiosity yeah so my my latest way is I
105:18 - will go on uh green screen and just
105:20 - basically just Rift
105:23 - yeah just just start going basically
105:26 - yeah just just Rift I'll have like
105:27 - bullet points on what I want to touch on
105:29 - but I'll just Rift in front of a green
105:30 - screen yeah uh and then I'll I'll film
105:33 - clips here and there throughout the
105:34 - process uh just doing like commentary
105:36 - that I can play if need be yeah that's
105:38 - cool so um at the end of your free
105:42 - cocaine course the course that you
105:44 - published uh on math or on uh computer
105:47 - science like basically programming 101
105:50 - you say remember to always always feed
105:53 - your curiosity you say that's the final
105:56 - most important rule can you true explain
106:00 - what you mean by feed your curiosity and
106:02 - why it's so
106:04 - important yeah that used to be my Mantra
106:07 - I used to always say it at theend of the
106:10 - videos I have it at the end of my
106:12 - description still but yeah so the the
106:13 - whole concept behind that is I I think
106:15 - it was really important it was a lesson
106:17 - that I learned pretty young
106:20 - that there there's so many like things
106:23 - that we can do in a in a
106:26 - lifetime
106:28 - but if you don't if you don't follow the
106:32 - things that make you curious if you
106:33 - don't feed that Curiosity you you will
106:36 - you'll never end up where you need or
106:38 - you deserve to
106:40 - be and it was just something that I like
106:44 - to say just to remind people that like
106:46 - yeah you might get curious about code
106:47 - you might get curious about whatever it
106:49 - is Graphics or sports or whatever it is
106:53 - take that action feed that Curiosity
106:55 - find out if you actually like it or
106:57 - not because you never know where it
106:59 - might lead you you know I would not be
107:01 - here today if it was for me feeding my
107:04 - insatiable curiosity yeah you might be
107:06 - working at Joanne's Fabric Store hey I
107:09 - could be working at Joann's Fabric Store
107:11 - it's a good call back yeah so what are
107:14 - you focused on now obviously uh you've
107:17 - got uh hackware can you talk about that
107:20 - real quick and also like your hacks like
107:22 - kind of like logo that's on your beanie
107:25 - here yeah very distinctive uh kind of
107:28 - like handdrawn almost like street art
107:31 - style oh
107:33 - yeah yeah yeah yeah so Hax is the it's
107:38 - very boring but it's just like the
107:39 - company that I use for legal stuff um
107:43 - but tax wear is the IP that I've been
107:47 - building out um I have a really really
107:50 - good story that I cannot wait to tell I
107:53 - wish I can do it faster if I could I
107:54 - would um but hack SAR is the IP and then
107:57 - hack is just like the business that I do
107:59 - merch
108:00 - and anytime I show up I don't know I I
108:03 - haven't really thought too much about
108:04 - hack but it's it's the business and the
108:06 - merchant the hackware it's a it's like a
108:08 - large like intellectual property you say
108:10 - IP like almost like a franchise or like
108:12 - a universe of characters and stories
108:16 - like you would think of like the Star
108:17 - Wars universe or something like that
108:19 - this is a big project it's like a
108:20 - multi-year Endeavor it's huge it's it's
108:23 - humongous it's humongous I've been
108:24 - writing it since 2019 wow it's humongous
108:27 - I wish I can get content out faster but
108:29 - is there like things anything you could
108:31 - say to describe it Beyond just like the
108:33 - name and like those posters behind you
108:35 - like what is it about sure sure so it's
108:38 - a it's a
108:40 - Galaxy um in which uh it's based on
108:45 - Shonen um battles so sh being like the
108:49 - like shou and in uh like the the young
108:52 - kid basically or like young years small
108:55 - years I think is literally how it
108:56 - translates and it's a style of manga
108:58 - like if you ever heard of like Shen jump
109:00 - or some of those uh manga that you can
109:02 - get from Japan that often are translated
109:04 - into English uh it's basically like a
109:06 - style of anime that's all about like
109:09 - mostly young men like kind of overcoming
109:12 - Their Fear and like leveling themselves
109:15 - up is the best way I could describe it
109:18 - is that a good description though yeah I
109:20 - think it's a fair enough description I
109:22 - think the description I like to use
109:23 - nowadays is it's uh story progression
109:27 - through fighting that's that's like the
109:29 - best way I like f like challenges like
109:32 - if you watch like uh for example uh
109:35 - Demon Slayer like it's like he goes from
109:38 - fighting like having to like slice the
109:40 - boulder in half to like finding
109:41 - progressively higher level demons um and
109:45 - and that that kind of uh yeah but go
109:48 - ahead yeah so so that that that's what
109:51 - has inspired me I love Shonen so much
109:54 - and that is the that that's at the
109:56 - center of of what the IP is but there
109:59 - are so many really good stories that
110:01 - like I've experienced that I've taken
110:02 - from other people um I I plan to bring
110:05 - out some other writers to tell some of
110:07 - their stories as well and just it's a
110:09 - Galaxy in which like all of this uh is
110:12 - contained in and the first story that
110:14 - I'm starting with it's haware
110:16 - Paragon it's that's the manga and it's
110:19 - about a young man Jinzo or two young men
110:21 - Jinzo and Swift
110:23 - who are from a little desolate planet
110:25 - and they have this dream to become a
110:27 - great fighter very cliche I understand
110:30 - but it's about the journey that they
110:32 - take that is the real interesting part
110:35 - um and so they're up against the the
110:38 - place that they live doesn't have a lot
110:39 - of resources so they don't have access
110:40 - to like you know work a job and and
110:43 - whatnot so they resort to Crime to make
110:46 - their money they're up against law
110:48 - enforcement they're up against um uh the
110:51 - generational um Authority that came
110:53 - before them uh they're up against
110:56 - themselves and they have to figure out
110:59 - how do they overcome the situation and
111:02 - that is the Lynch pin for the hack for
111:03 - IP but I I have so many stories that
111:05 - I've written and I honestly can't wait
111:07 - to tell and just I got to figure out the
111:09 - best way to get those story out yeah and
111:12 - so you're thinking it's going to be a
111:13 - manga and then ultimately like an anime
111:16 - or are you going to make it an
111:17 - interactive
111:19 - experience I'm still trying to figure it
111:21 - out I I started with the first thing I
111:23 - made was a um audio book because it was
111:27 - simple and easy to get it up and running
111:28 - but like people don't really care about
111:29 - audio books is what I learned and so I
111:31 - did a manga but now the manga's taking a
111:33 - while so I'm thinking about doing like
111:34 - an app type thing yeah like maybe a
111:37 - visual novel or something that's the
111:38 - medium we chose I mean it's not as
111:41 - exciting I think but maybe like a voiced
111:43 - visual novel could be like a good
111:45 - compromise where you could just get
111:46 - still images instead of having like
111:48 - animation you're doing so many frames it
111:50 - like exponentially balloons and cost
111:52 - right yeah yeah well we haven't done any
111:55 - animation yet we still have the manga
111:58 - but yeah yeah so there's a lot of lot of
112:00 - really good stories that I'm really
112:01 - excited to tell um we also have a video
112:03 - game that is being released in this IP
112:05 - as well hackware enforcer games haware
112:07 - enforcer very cool yeah and uh so would
112:10 - you say that's like your like long run
112:13 - like your long-term Vision like how like
112:15 - the next 5 10 years is that a huge part
112:17 - of your professional life uh I hope so I
112:20 - hope so I think if I'm looking long term
112:22 - I just really want to tell this story
112:24 - and just have the story out here I I one
112:27 - of my favorite stories I'm sorry one of
112:29 - my favorite IPS of all time is
112:32 - X-Men and it didn't become my favorite
112:35 - IP until I learned about its
112:37 - inspiration it was Stanley's commentary
112:39 - on civil rights and when I learned
112:43 - that it overnight the value of X-Men
112:47 - changed for me and that is just the
112:49 - power of Storytelling I believe and so
112:51 - like that that that's what I want to do
112:52 - is want to tell a really good story that
112:54 - is fun entertaining but also like really
112:56 - says something you
112:58 - know yeah absolutely man I'm a huge
113:01 - X-Men fan uh I'm actually watching the
113:03 - animated series with my kids uh the the
113:06 - old one didn't they reboot it Xmen is
113:09 - not a reboot it's a continuation they
113:10 - just pick up where they left off really
113:13 - yeah it's called X-Men 97 and it
113:15 - literally takes like the last episode
113:16 - and just goes right into yeah like it
113:19 - never ended oh I never knew that so I
113:22 - don't I just learned about this from
