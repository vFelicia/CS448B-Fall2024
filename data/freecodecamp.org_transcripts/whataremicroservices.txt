00:04 - Microservices architecture is a pattern for organizing computer systems into services that can scale with demand
00:12 - Back in the 1990's an internet company would run a big monolithic program on a server that the company maintained
00:20 - on-premise
00:21 - To serve an increase in traffic a popular company would simply add more instances of the monolith
00:28 - Monolithic architectures do have some positive features
00:32 - A monolith centralizes the codebase so it is in one place
00:37 - Engineers can step through any part of the code when they are debugging
00:42 - Also user requests that are completely served by a monolith do not have to make many calls across a network
00:48 - Which reduces the chance of Network failures
00:52 - Most software companies have their code in a monolith today
00:56 - When those monoliths get big problems can start to occur
01:01 - Centralized code leads to tight couplings that are hard to break up
01:05 - If a program is too big it will be impossible to run on a typical machine
01:11 - Internet giants in the early 2000s began breaking up their applications into services
01:16 - Instead of scaling the monolithic application
01:20 - a service-oriented architecture could scale the parts of an application that were under load
01:25 - Operating system virtualization made service-oriented architecture more economical
01:32 - One server could host multiple virtualized operating system instances and each of those instances could run a service
01:40 - But this also meant that engineers had to manage more and more layers of infrastructure the virtual machine hosts
01:47 - the hypervisor layer and
01:49 - the hardware itself
01:52 - Failures became more complex
01:54 - Debugging got harder
01:57 - In 2006 Amazon Web Services launched the Elastic Compute cloud
02:02 - Ec2 allows programmers to rent virtual machines in Amazon's data centers. With Amazon taking care of failures at the hardware level
02:11 - and the hypervisor level
02:13 - Programmers could focus on the virtual machine hosts themselves where their application code was running
02:20 - But using an entire virtual machine to run a small piece of application code is wasteful
02:27 - Containers allow a virtual machine to be sliced up into isolated filesystem regions
02:34 - A container can be as large as the entire VM or as small as your smallest service. Hence the term micro services
02:42 - Micro services run in containers which run on a virtual machine which runs on a hypervisor which runs on a server
02:50 - Which sits in Iraq which sits in a data center, which is part of a network of data centers called the cloud
02:58 - Containerized architecture it led to a new problem
03:01 - Companies that ran thousands of micro services in containers on the cloud did not have a simple way of managing them
03:08 - Kubernetes is an open source project from Google that gives engineers a centralized system for managing containers
03:16 - Kubernetes also makes those services portable
03:19 - Creating a competitive tension between Amazon Web Services and Google cloud platform
03:25 - both of which can host kubernetes clusters
03:28 - The days of micro services are just getting started
03:31 - Software development has never been easier and the two biggest companies in the cloud are competing for users
03:38 - It's going to keep getting easier and cheaper
