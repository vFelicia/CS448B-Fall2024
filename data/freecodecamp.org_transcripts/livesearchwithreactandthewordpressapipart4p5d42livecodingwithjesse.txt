00:10 - hey everyone welcome to live coding with
00:12 - jesse
00:14 - i'm jesse
00:15 - and
00:16 - today we're gonna keep coding
00:19 - our search page
00:22 - and
00:23 - we already have
00:24 - the search working with the wordpress
00:26 - api so we type in the search box
00:29 - and whatever we type get saved into
00:32 - state because we're using react
00:34 - and then state
00:36 - updates the input
00:38 - and every time the input changes it
00:40 - fires off a function
00:42 - that searches sends off a search query
00:45 - to the wordpress api
00:47 - that data comes back and then populates
00:49 - our page
00:51 - now what we want to do
00:53 - is take some of those check boxes that
00:55 - we added in yesterday
00:57 - and we're going to connect those to the
00:59 - state
01:00 - and we're going to use the value in
01:02 - state
01:03 - to change our parameters in our our
01:07 - query that we're sending to the
01:08 - wordpress api
01:10 - so that a user wouldn't just search for
01:13 - one word throughout all our data they
01:15 - would search for a word and be able to
01:17 - say i want to search for just this word
01:20 - in just this
01:22 - type of content
01:24 - so they'll be able to narrow down their
01:26 - search
01:27 - a lot more
01:28 - and it'll have the added benefit as well
01:32 - uh to be a little bit easier
01:35 - on the wordpress api and not having to
01:38 - search through so many different types
01:41 - of of data because everything's split
01:43 - out into custom post types
01:45 - so on our end of things we send one
01:47 - query but really on the wordpress n
01:51 - it needs to make separate
01:54 - searches as far as i understand from the
01:56 - way
01:57 - it works in the php is that separate
02:00 - searches happen
02:02 - for each of those post types so
02:06 - all around i think it'll be a better
02:07 - user experience and it'll cut down on
02:11 - what needs to happen uh in wordpress to
02:14 - get that data out to us
02:16 - so that's the plan for today all right
02:19 - cool looks like from
02:21 - the uh stream analytics we have a decent
02:23 - number of viewers so i'm going to put
02:25 - the
02:26 - link
02:27 - to what we're working on in the live
02:29 - chat now
02:31 - and
02:32 - i may put it in again later if we get
02:34 - some more users i don't want anyone to
02:36 - miss out
02:40 - so
02:43 - the link that i just put into the live
02:44 - chat
02:45 - will connect you up with what i'm
02:47 - running locally
02:50 - so we're using a service called ngrok
02:53 - and the creator of ngrok
02:55 - has generously
02:57 - allowed free code camp in this stream to
03:00 - use an unlimited version of ngrok for
03:03 - free
03:05 - which is awesome i'm not even sure that
03:07 - you can buy an unlimited version i think
03:09 - the plans all have limits so
03:12 - really awesome of him to uh
03:15 - to donate that for us and it allows this
03:18 - stream to be a lot more interactive so
03:20 - you can check the site open it up in dev
03:22 - tools every time i make a change locally
03:25 - you will be able to see the change
03:26 - immediately in your browser you're not
03:29 - limited to seeing just the page that i
03:31 - have on the screen you can you look
03:33 - around in the site
03:35 - and
03:37 - you do whatever you like
03:40 - so let me oh before we start i want to
03:43 - tell you just a little story so please
03:45 - be patient with me and humor me for a
03:47 - second while i tell you the story
03:49 - i forgot to say yesterday
03:52 - but
03:53 - yesterday i was in a coffee shop so i
03:55 - spent the morning working in a new
03:57 - coffee shop that just opened yesterday
03:59 - morning and it's
04:01 - very close to where i work so it's
04:04 - it's a little bit far to walk
04:06 - uh it's down a hill and then across the
04:09 - street and stuff but driving distance
04:11 - it's
04:12 - you know less than a minute so anyway i
04:14 - go in there
04:16 - and i'm working on my laptop so i'm a
04:18 - laptop with all the dev stickers and
04:20 - everything on it and uh i'm working and
04:23 - then i notice somebody's looking at me
04:25 - and so i look over there and they come
04:28 - come over and say are you jesse and i
04:30 - say yeah and they said i watch your
04:33 - stream i watch your coding stuff
04:35 - and uh it was just like the weirdest
04:38 - like coolest thing
04:40 - um
04:41 - i i've never had anybody recognize me
04:44 - from the stream before
04:46 - and
04:47 - i don't know it was really awesome so uh
04:49 - so i talked to him for a while and it
04:52 - turns out he's a computer science
04:56 - major here at the university that i work
04:58 - for and i i've never met him before
05:00 - uh so he actually knows some of the same
05:02 - students in the computer science program
05:05 - uh and you know he's been watching my
05:07 - show and i had no idea so i i
05:10 - got a picture with him and we exchanged
05:13 - emails and i i invited him to come over
05:16 - and be on the show if he wants to or you
05:19 - know come to my office and
05:21 - show me what he's working on or ask me
05:22 - questions or anything so
05:26 - anyway i that was just a really
05:28 - amazing experience for me
05:31 - so i just wanted to share that with you
05:33 - all if any of you ever do happen to see
05:35 - me
05:36 - don't hesitate to come up and talk to me
05:38 - i'm really friendly
05:40 - and um
05:42 - so
05:43 - i won't
05:44 - you won't bother me like i won't be
05:46 - freaked out just
05:48 - you know say hi i'll be super happy if
05:51 - you say hi so
05:53 - uh i know if any of you are in the
05:54 - pittsburgh area like
05:56 - it's possible you might see me because
05:59 - i i am also in the pittsburgh area uh
06:02 - and i just said somebody asked me about
06:04 - my dev stickers so i'm going to show my
06:05 - laptop quickly
06:08 - because i have it here so
06:10 - here are my stickers
06:14 - so i have some this is a windows 95
06:18 - sticker
06:19 - and i found this one
06:21 - on a window when they were doing
06:23 - construction on my building
06:25 - and somebody had just left it there
06:27 - so it was
06:29 - essentially probably going to be
06:31 - taken out with the window and thrown
06:33 - away so i made sure i grabbed that and
06:35 - it's held on with scotch tape
06:38 - i have some from november conference
06:42 - syntax con
06:44 - hacktoberfest
06:46 - so
06:47 - all of them are tech related except for
06:50 - this one or
06:52 - this one is just darth vader one my
06:54 - brother-in-law's got me that for
06:55 - christmas
06:56 - um
06:58 - and then this is a window sticker and i
07:00 - took off the microsoft because it was
07:01 - huge and just kept these so anyway
07:06 - those are my laptop stickers for right
07:08 - now i have a little bit of space left to
07:10 - put some some more on there
07:12 - and um
07:14 - oh cool so peter says the darth vader
07:16 - one's cool yeah i actually have
07:20 - i have some other ones i just didn't
07:22 - really have a spot to put them so they
07:24 - might end up going on
07:26 - uh another laptop or i don't know what
07:29 - i'm gonna do with them for sure but i
07:31 - have
07:32 - uh
07:33 - boba fett
07:34 - and
07:36 - this uh skull
07:38 - i have a stormtrooper and
07:42 - kylo ren
07:44 - so that's some cool ones and i have some
07:46 - other ones
07:49 - like uh netlify
07:51 - and
07:53 - like
07:54 - get i get kraken
07:56 - uh so i just have some other ones
07:58 - uh usually i um
08:01 - i only like to put stickers on my laptop
08:03 - for things that i actually use so some
08:05 - of the ones that aren't on there yet are
08:07 - products that i don't really use
08:09 - some of them i do want to try to use at
08:11 - some point so they might get on there
08:14 - um
08:17 - so oh michael says sign them and send
08:19 - them to people oh that's a cool idea
08:23 - i never thought anybody would want
08:26 - anything signed by me but
08:28 - that's actually not a bad idea
08:31 - i'm still not sure people would want
08:32 - them signed they might just want the
08:33 - stickers but
08:36 - yeah off to think about that i'll
08:38 - yeah maybe i'll think about me what the
08:39 - best way to do that would be and um and
08:42 - i'll get this i also have some free code
08:44 - camp stickers at my house
08:51 - all right
08:52 - so i better get started
08:58 - i want one more comment i'm going to
09:00 - read off before we get started
09:02 - um from tracy
09:05 - uh says hi jesse thanks for the live
09:07 - coding stream uh you're welcome thanks
09:09 - for watching i'm just looking for my
09:11 - post php heavy development environment
09:14 - just wondering and learning thanks to
09:15 - free code camp and generous coders like

10:35 - a meeting at 3 p.m
10:38 - my time it is now 1 42 p.m
10:42 - so we can't be
10:43 - super long on this stream i still want
10:45 - to try to get two pomodoro sessions in
10:47 - if i can
10:49 - alright steven's a senior web developer
10:51 - slash designer

11:02 - um
11:04 - yeah so cool
11:06 - really happy for you
11:09 - all right so let me
11:11 - all right we have a bunch of people now
11:13 - in the chat so i'm not going to keep you
11:15 - all waiting uh any longer let me
11:18 - switch the screens
11:20 - you have something better to look at
11:21 - than my face
11:23 - and uh
11:24 - start the pomodoro timer
11:27 - and
11:28 - get back to here i was working on the
11:30 - server
11:32 - uh i don't have that committed yet to
11:35 - github but it's just very minor work and
11:37 - just some comments
11:39 - so we're going to be working on the
11:41 - search
11:42 - the search page
11:44 - and i did do a few changes to the search
11:46 - page and pretty much all i did was
11:48 - change the text
11:50 - on the page
11:51 - so
11:53 - it's not completely up to date on github
11:55 - yet but there's nothing major that's
11:57 - changed just just the text
12:01 - um
12:02 - okay see uh you want me to share the
12:04 - link to the pomodoro timer i will share
12:06 - that i think this is the one
12:09 - that harshit built so one of our our
12:12 - viewers
12:13 - uh built this pomodoro timer and so
12:16 - we're so we're using that
12:18 - so i know several of you have built
12:20 - pomodoro timers if anybody builds
12:21 - pomodoro timer and wants me to use it on
12:24 - the show let me know
12:25 - uh send me a link to it or something and
12:28 - i can rotate and
12:32 - just kind of use a different one every
12:33 - time
12:36 - okay so let me go down
12:41 - here let's make some space
12:43 - let's get rid of that and let's move
12:45 - this over here
12:46 - we don't really need this terminal right
12:48 - now
12:49 - there we are
12:50 - okay
12:52 - so we have a separate page that's a
12:55 - component a react component for our our
12:58 - search page
12:59 - if you want to see it just type in uh
13:02 - slash search at the end of that ngrok
13:05 - link
13:06 - and i ought to put that in the live chat
13:09 - one more time since we do have a lot of
13:11 - new people that weren't here when i put
13:13 - it in before so this ngrok link
13:17 - after the dot io put slash search
13:21 - and you can see what page will be
13:22 - working on so you can see i just changed
13:24 - the labels so i didn't even change the
13:27 - the values or
13:29 - you know anything like that yet so i
13:30 - need to go in and change that first
13:34 - and
13:36 - then we can
13:38 - actually start testing this out
13:41 - the search i don't think works right now
13:43 - so i think when i added these check
13:44 - boxes in i broke something
13:47 - so it may not work
13:51 - klaus asked about are we using wordpress
13:53 - with node.js i thought it was only php
13:56 - uh we're getting data from wordpress and
13:58 - we're pulling it in to react that we're
14:01 - running with node so we're using both
14:04 - but the wordpress is now it's hosted
14:09 - i think i have a test wordpress site on
14:12 - godaddy
14:13 - i think yeah
14:15 - i don't think i made a droplet for it
14:17 - eventually it'll be on its own
14:18 - digitalocean droplet
14:20 - we might go with aws i haven't decided
14:23 - for sure yet
14:25 - uh so let's make this majors
14:29 - and i did have some i sat down with my
14:31 - boss today and decided some things about
14:35 - uh design
14:36 - on some of the pages so we may have some
14:38 - new stuff going on with
14:42 - design departments and
14:46 - what's this
14:48 - faculty
14:53 - so some of the interior pages are going
14:56 - to have a little bit more involved a
14:58 - fancier design
14:59 - you know bit more elements on the page
15:02 - so we'll probably be working on that
15:03 - sometime soon
15:05 - and i had another presentation of this
15:07 - website today
15:09 - which which went
15:10 - well uh so
15:14 - had some good questions too to kind of
15:16 - like think about up you know
15:18 - opportunities and possibilities for the
15:19 - site
15:22 - okay
15:23 - news
15:24 - oh i i had put news in here but we're
15:27 - going to change this up to match what we
15:28 - just had so we had faculty
15:32 - majors what was the other one
15:34 - departments
15:37 - departments
15:41 - major and i need to make that
15:46 - singular i believe
15:49 - so let's keep them the same here
15:51 - oops
15:53 - department
15:54 - i like i like to keep it all
15:58 - singular
16:12 - i don't know why i made that plural it
16:14 - doesn't really even make sense as a
16:16 - plural label
16:22 - okay
16:26 - so let me save that and then i'm going
16:28 - to show you uh what it looks like now on
16:31 - the search page
16:33 - i can find it
16:39 - there we are
16:40 - so i was on the theology page
16:44 - which actually the uh the logo didn't
16:46 - load oh there we are
16:49 - i don't know what happened there but
16:50 - let's move this to the search
16:54 - search page i also have an idea for how
16:57 - to change the router i think it'll make
16:59 - the router a little bit faster and it'll
17:01 - give us more freedom to do things with
17:02 - the routes so i'm not going to change
17:06 - that much on it but
17:08 - i think the change will be good so i
17:10 - might do that on a different stream or
17:12 - maybe after i do the change i'll just
17:14 - show what happened on the next stream
17:16 - after that
17:20 - and
17:21 - let's see
17:25 - all right if you are asking questions in
17:26 - the live chat i'm not ignoring you i'm
17:29 - just going to get to the questions once
17:30 - this pomodoro timer gets down to zero
17:33 - and then i'll take a few minutes and and
17:34 - catch up with the live chat
17:37 - okay so here's what we have
17:39 - now we have our search input
17:42 - what i'd like the user to be able to do
17:44 - once they search is also to click
17:47 - one or more of these check boxes
17:49 - and then it'll say you know
17:52 - they let's say they only want to search
17:54 - for faculty members
17:57 - then they just check faculty and they
17:59 - type in their search and they'll only
18:00 - get results
18:02 - that are faculty members
18:05 - you know so or any combination of these
18:09 - so we'll definitely have more check
18:11 - boxes than just this
18:13 - and we'll also at some point have a
18:15 - sorting feature as well
18:17 - that might be the next thing that we add
18:19 - in so that you know maybe they can sort
18:22 - the pages by
18:24 - newest
18:25 - or
18:26 - alphabetically or you know however else
18:29 - we can think of to sort them we want to
18:31 - give we want to give the users the most
18:33 - freedom and control of their search as
18:35 - as we can reasonably give them
18:40 - so let's actually let me see if this is
18:42 - working
18:45 - whoa
18:46 - yeah not working
18:51 - all right so i'm sure as we go through
18:53 - oops
18:54 - as we go through and connect these check
18:57 - boxes up to our our search function
19:00 - we'll find the mistake
19:02 - hopefully
19:05 - okay so we already have our our on
19:08 - change functions connected and it's
19:11 - going to pass
19:12 - this value
19:14 - okay which is great and this value will
19:16 - match up
19:17 - with the key
19:19 - that we have in state
19:21 - so with state
19:23 - oops
19:24 - we have these uh check boxes
19:29 - and
19:31 - they're split up
19:33 - let's see how we split up
19:36 - right now we have an array of objects
19:40 - i'm gonna leave it like that just for
19:42 - now but i don't think we need to have an
19:44 - array of objects i think we can clean
19:46 - that up a little bit but
19:48 - um
19:50 - i'd really like to just get this working
19:52 - uh so when i you know maybe try to go as
19:55 - fast as i can through this
19:57 - uh let's see tomorrow major faculty so
20:01 - in our search term
20:04 - for our fetch search term function
20:09 - we have this state search type
20:12 - okay that needs to go on to this this
20:14 - url so the search term is going to tell
20:17 - wordpress
20:19 - what to search for
20:20 - but then these search types are going to
20:22 - tell it which post types to actually do
20:25 - the search in
20:27 - so
20:28 - we need to create this as a string
20:33 - so what we can do
20:37 - is
20:39 - make this
20:41 - uh let's see
20:44 - let's
20:49 - how are we gonna do this
20:52 - search
20:58 - oh okay sorry so we're making uh in
21:02 - state we have search type
21:06 - so
21:10 - sorry about that i was in the wrong
21:12 - function i i had
21:14 - forgotten that we made this in a state
21:16 - so let's we want to go to the function
21:18 - where we're actually clicking
21:20 - uh on the check box
21:23 - and that is handle change i believe
21:26 - yep
21:28 - okay
21:29 - so when we handle the change
21:33 - we're saying this set states
21:38 - and then whatever the name is and then
21:40 - we're we're making it the value checked
21:46 - so this is how we pulled this in from
21:49 - the component demo in the material ui
21:52 - documentation
21:54 - we may need to change this
22:01 - let me think
22:08 - so
22:09 - we certainly
22:12 - don't want
22:14 - the values
22:16 - to be
22:17 - let's see how we're
22:18 - doing this is state name check
22:22 - yeah we're going to have to switch it up
22:27 - so just to show you what's what's
22:29 - happening now let's check this out and
22:30 - let's go into the react dev tools
22:41 - uh so
22:44 - let me it was our search
22:48 - don't we ever search component
22:50 - i guess not
23:06 - all right so here's our state
23:12 - so we have our check boxes array but
23:15 - when you actually click a check box
23:17 - you see
23:19 - it adds faculty right so
23:23 - it's still doing what it was doing in
23:24 - the material ui
23:26 - uh documentation so it's not even at all
23:29 - you're taking into account what we've
23:31 - created in state
23:35 - uh so let's switch this up a bit
23:39 - i think
23:40 - [Music]
23:42 - so we need to keep this sort of thing
23:45 - here but
23:48 - i would rather have
23:51 - yeah
23:54 - i would rather have this in
23:58 - the check boxes array
24:03 - and as long as we keep the the names of
24:05 - the check boxes the same as
24:08 - what we actually have to search for
24:11 - uh or the name we actually have to put
24:13 - in the query i think this will work
24:15 - because we can just grab
24:18 - we can grab the keys
24:20 - and use those
24:22 - so let's try that out
24:31 - so if we were to do this it needs to be
24:37 - this set states and
24:46 - hmm
24:50 - what did we call that oh check boxes
25:00 - all right how are we gonna do this
25:03 - check boxes
25:07 - i'm not sure if this will work
25:09 - i'm gonna try like this first
25:11 - not sure if it'll work but let's let's
25:13 - give it a shot
25:14 - i'm also going to
25:17 - remove
25:21 - i'm going to remove all of this
25:28 - and
25:29 - just do that instead
25:33 - all right so let's see if it works
25:40 - all
25:40 - right cool
25:45 - uh no not cool so it's not
25:48 - yes we don't want that we want
25:51 - let's see
25:59 - um
26:10 - oops
26:11 - the state
26:20 - all right let's try that uh so what
26:22 - we'll do here is um
26:25 - we're combining these
26:28 - so these three dots i believe that's the
26:30 - spread operator correct me with them
26:32 - wrong sometimes i uh
26:34 - i forget the terminology uh but this is
26:37 - going to allow us just to combine these
26:39 - two things so that before it was
26:41 - overwriting this
26:42 - now it's going to combine it let's let's
26:44 - test it out make sure that's right
26:50 - okay
26:56 - um
26:57 - not working
27:00 - let me refresh completely here
27:04 - and see what's happening
27:15 - there we are search
27:19 - okay so let's check out check boxes
27:21 - there's nothing right now if we click
27:23 - faculty there we are in department
27:26 - no no no okay it's not working now
27:43 - what did i do
27:49 - all right let me see what i've done
27:51 - let me check the live chat chat first to
27:54 - see if you all have caught my mistake
27:57 - since you all usually catch my mistakes
27:58 - before i do
28:00 - um
28:01 - let's see
28:01 - [Music]
28:03 - uh nikki says initialize every checkbox
28:06 - value in state
28:10 - okay so i should initialize all the
28:11 - values first then in state
28:21 - let's see
28:35 - steven says it's not resetting that
28:37 - state when unselected
29:05 - all right well let's
29:09 - let's put in the values
29:13 - and see if that does anything
29:16 - so we're going to initialize these
29:18 - values here in state
29:22 - oops not what i wanted to do
29:28 - so what did we have department
29:35 - let's do
29:40 - um
29:42 - major
29:48 - faculty
29:58 - okay
29:59 - so now
30:00 - we have them initialized in state
30:28 - okay
30:31 - uh let's see nikki saying use the
30:35 - pre-state version of getting state
30:42 - i probably should just check the get up
30:44 - repo for
30:45 - the catechetical institute site that we
30:47 - did the same thing in
30:49 - and see how we did it there
30:53 - that would probably save us a lot of
30:54 - time so let's let's check that out
31:00 - and
31:01 - see i react
31:03 - let's see
31:09 - pages
31:11 - resources
31:14 - okay so where are we handling
31:18 - results
31:20 - check
31:42 - that's weird
31:44 - hmm
31:49 - all right i have a better repo
31:53 - let's look at that resource center repo
31:57 - because we we were using material ui
31:59 - here so
32:02 - i don't think
32:03 - i don't think we were doing it the best
32:05 - way for the catechetical institute site
32:08 - since we were mixing in
32:10 - uh
32:11 - materialized css
32:15 - components
32:24 - where is our form
32:35 - rose
32:37 - no
32:38 - oh views all right
32:44 - all right so in our service request form
32:52 - this kind of check boxes
33:14 - handle input change
33:36 - name
33:38 - okay
33:38 - um
33:40 - i'm checking live chat again to see some
33:43 - more things uh
33:46 - he says you're already using it a bunch
33:48 - uh set state uh
33:50 - okay
33:56 - sure
33:57 - objects
33:59 - okay uh nikki yeah let me try it i'll
34:02 - try that out
34:03 - before we implement some of this
34:06 - uh before i try to implement some of
34:08 - that
34:37 - okay
34:39 - um
34:44 - here we are
34:57 - okay
35:06 - oh what am i getting here
35:48 - nikki saying another closing parenthesis
35:53 - you ever an existing one didn't add a
35:55 - new one oh okay you're
35:59 - thanks
36:01 - cool totally didn't see that
36:03 - uh my my timer is going off for this
36:05 - pomodoro session so i'm gonna take a
36:07 - break answer some questions in the live
36:08 - chat and then come back to this
36:12 - and see if we can sort out
36:15 - what we need to do here
36:17 - so we have done this two different ways
36:20 - in previous projects
36:22 - this project is
36:24 - slightly different uh but
36:27 - i'm sure we can figure this out
36:29 - by uh adapting what we've done
36:32 - previously if we have to
36:36 - all right so let's set five minute timer
36:39 - i'm going to scroll up to the top so i i
36:41 - don't miss any questions and i'm just
36:44 - going to go down through whatever was
36:45 - asked first that's what i'll get to
36:47 - first
36:48 - hopefully i can get to everything
36:50 - before i have to end the stream
36:56 - hey everyone see a lot of a lot of
36:58 - people saying hello so i'm just gonna
37:00 - say hi to everyone uh let's say hi there
37:02 - at the beginning of the chat
37:36 - so i'm scrolling down there are no
37:38 - questions so far or i've already
37:40 - addressed them
37:46 - oh michael says jesse your kids grow up
37:49 - so fast
37:52 - they do grow up so fast
37:55 - but i'm not sure why
37:56 - where did that come from in
37:58 - the middle of the
37:59 - the coding
38:01 - but that is definitely true
38:08 - uh
38:09 - srikanth says you're doing great you
38:11 - deserve some appreciation jesse thank
38:13 - you
38:14 - thank
38:16 - you trying to do a good job
38:19 - and uh
38:21 - to be honest with you most people are
38:22 - are appreciative of of the work i do so
38:25 - occasionally there are some people that
38:27 - aren't so appreciative but
38:29 - they're in the minority of of people i
38:32 - um
38:33 - i usually hear positive comments so
38:36 - uh it's it's
38:38 - been really nice
38:40 - uh
38:41 - cesar asks is this really advanced
38:44 - um
38:46 - i'm i'm not sure
38:49 - it doesn't seem that advanced for me but
38:52 - i like we've gradually been building up
38:54 - to this so
38:56 - it probably seems like a lot right now
38:58 - like just coming into the project
39:01 - uh but
39:02 - i guess kind of keep in mind that like
39:04 - we've built up to this little by little
39:07 - uh so
39:11 - i mean you definitely
39:12 - you know it's not it's not a project i
39:14 - would give to a beginner for sure
39:17 - uh but the building blocks to get here
39:19 - you know are sometimes you know just
39:22 - very simple things it's just we combine
39:23 - them
39:24 - and uh and you know build on them and
39:27 - then we end up with uh
39:29 - i don't know what i think is is turned
39:31 - out to be a pretty nice site
39:36 - i'm gonna have to google translate this
39:38 - next question
39:40 - and let's detect language
39:43 - so
39:45 - we have a question that says your
39:46 - movements are correct the applications
39:48 - you're doing are not right
39:51 - so
39:54 - um that was i think that that statement
39:56 - came around the time when i was trying
39:58 - to do the uh checkbox stuff so
40:01 - um
40:04 - yeah so i guess that's uh
40:08 - that was true yeah i am messing
40:09 - something up here
40:12 - in is here and it says hey hey how's it
40:15 - going thanks for watching
40:21 - uh chris says using a virtual dom with
40:24 - react in es6 looks pretty awesome it is
40:27 - pretty awesome it's really fun i i think
40:30 - react is is super fun
40:46 - uh
40:48 - ew
40:49 - ilia i think that's how you pronounce it
40:51 - let me know if it's not but ilia says
40:52 - could you describe your computer setup
40:54 - okay so my setup right now is i have an
40:57 - imac
40:59 - and
41:00 - it has
41:02 - i'm running like 32 gigs of ram it has
41:06 - the 27 inch um 4k screen on the main
41:10 - screen or i'm sorry 5k screen on the
41:12 - main screen i'm running a the secondary
41:16 - uh 2k 27 inch monitor i think i think
41:19 - it's 27
41:20 - and um then as another screen i have a a
41:24 - vertical display that's just an old
41:27 - lenovo widescreen monitor uh but it's
41:30 - it's just vertical uh and that's kind of
41:33 - good for longer
41:35 - um
41:37 - articles and things like that sometimes
41:38 - i put dev tools over there
41:42 - and so that's my setup right now i have
41:44 - an external microphone set up so it's
41:47 - better audio for the streams um which i
41:50 - think i use
41:51 - the keyboard that comes with with a mac
41:54 - and like the trackpad thing that comes
41:57 - with the mac so that's that's my setup i
42:00 - don't remember
42:01 - i guess i could tell you
42:02 - real quick if i go to
42:04 - about
42:07 - uh this computer i could tell you what
42:08 - the specs are
42:12 - i mean i'm using visual studio code for
42:14 - my editor and
42:17 - my terminal is item 2
42:20 - about this mac let's see
42:26 - yeah okay so they are 27 inch displays
42:28 - the retina 5k it's the late 2014 model
42:31 - imac
42:32 - uh four gigahertz intel core i7
42:37 - and
42:38 - uh amd radeon r9 uh two gigabyte
42:42 - graphics card
42:44 - yep
42:46 - and
42:50 - not that it matters that much but i'm
42:52 - i'm running the uh
42:54 - one terabyte hard drive
42:56 - uh i i believe it's the ssd
43:01 - but i can't be sure
43:05 - i don't remember for sure
43:17 - wow that lenovo display is it's 21.5
43:21 - inch and it is in
43:24 - 1080p crazy i did not realize that
43:29 - it just doesn't look that good compared
43:31 - to the right next to the 5k screen so
43:35 - alright so let me
43:39 - go back do another pomodoro session and
43:42 - then anything that i've missed in the
43:44 - live chat
43:45 - i'm going to answer after this next
43:48 - pomodoro session
43:50 - i need to write down where i left off in
43:52 - the chat let's see
44:05 - okay
44:09 - i need to keep an eye on the time
44:11 - so i'm not late for my next meeting
44:15 - all right it looks like uh there were a
44:18 - few other things in the
44:20 - in the chat about our uh the issue that
44:23 - i'm having right now so let me check
44:25 - those out
44:30 - uh christoph i see that
44:33 - uh your suggestion
44:43 - okay nikki says we don't need an updater
44:45 - function if we're using the material ui
44:49 - box
45:00 - all right great kristoff um i think uh
45:03 - you what you put in there is gonna work
45:08 - yeah
45:10 - yeah that looks good
45:12 - uh let me change this up to do that as
45:15 - well
45:20 - so we want
45:21 - check we're going to take name
45:26 - and put it here
45:29 - and
45:31 - then we'll do
45:32 - [Music]
45:35 - checked
45:40 - yeah
45:41 - so we're not going to need
45:43 - whoops
45:44 - yeah i'm gonna be able to take a lot of
45:46 - this out
45:48 - take that out
45:50 - oops and i need a
45:55 - this set stage check boxes
46:05 - all right let me see
46:07 - event check
46:09 - interchange
46:19 - okay
46:22 - what are we doing
46:38 - okay
46:43 - there we are right
46:50 - no
46:53 - all
46:54 - right
46:56 - and
46:57 - i don't need that
47:01 - okay
47:02 - now let's check boxes to still give me
47:03 - trouble
47:18 - uh
47:18 - let's try that x equal checklist
47:22 - checks should
47:32 - i mean i'm looking at this
47:34 - it looks like it
47:36 - should work
47:50 - actually let me
47:52 - let me go back to what we originally had
47:54 - that i know worked
48:01 - no i don't want to
48:02 - let's see i don't want to go that far
48:04 - back
48:05 - so i'm gonna miss out on that let's just
48:06 - let me just grab from material ui what
48:09 - we did have
48:13 - if i can find it
48:15 - i have a lot of stuff up on my screens
48:17 - right now
48:27 - there we go
48:29 - all right so let me grab that
48:32 - handle change
48:43 - okay so this is what we did have for
48:45 - handle change so let's just put
48:52 - check boxes name handle change all right
48:55 - so we are still getting the same stuff
48:58 - going on here
49:10 - i want to verify that
49:12 - yeah so we are still getting there
49:16 - okay let me check back in the live chat
49:28 - okay nikki saying what we did have
49:30 - before almost worked we just needed to
49:32 - spread
49:33 - uh
49:35 - inside the check boxes section on the
49:38 - state then add the update
49:53 - okay
50:00 - actually
50:02 - oh let me let me look back one more time
50:04 - too at how we did it here
50:14 - were we really putting
50:20 - so we
50:21 - okay so we were doing this uh
50:24 - in this state within form
50:27 - we were putting all our checkbox stuff
50:30 - inside form
50:36 - so when we went to handle the input
50:38 - change
50:39 - let's just ignore all the stuff that's
50:41 - not about check boxes
50:44 - so if it was a check box we're just
50:47 - saying checked
50:53 - so the value is checked
50:55 - we're doing form name
50:59 - value checked so this state form
51:02 - oh
51:03 - okay
51:04 - all right this makes a lot more sense
51:06 - so what we're doing here is getting
51:09 - that whole object that is formed which
51:12 - in our case will be check boxes we're
51:14 - getting that object
51:15 - we are
51:17 - changing the object and then we're
51:20 - setting
51:21 - the state of that object
51:25 - that makes sense
51:28 - let's do that
51:32 - so let's go
51:35 - um
51:45 - checkboxes
51:49 - whoops
51:51 - let checkboxes
51:53 - equal
51:55 - this states
51:58 - check
51:59 - boxes
52:04 - oops
52:06 - check boxes
52:09 - and then we're going to do
52:13 - um
52:15 - this
52:17 - boxes
52:24 - name
52:27 - equals
52:29 - checked
52:34 - and then
52:38 - we're going to do
52:41 - this set state equals
52:51 - let's say check boxes close
52:55 - check boxes
52:57 - all right let me see if this works and
52:59 - then if it does i'll explain what i've
53:01 - done but no sense in telling you the
53:03 - wrong thing if this doesn't work
53:10 - okay so do we have no we're not i want
53:12 - to be able to see the state make sure
53:14 - we're doing the right thing
53:23 - no is that not it
53:26 - okay here we are so we're in check boxes
53:33 - no it's still creating one outside of
53:35 - here
53:38 - why do we have double
53:42 - okay so it is doing what we want but
53:44 - it's also doing something else
54:01 - all right where is this where's this
54:03 - part happening
54:09 - all right so what i'm trying to do in
54:11 - here and let me know in the live chat if
54:13 - if i'm
54:15 - uh messing this up somehow but basically
54:17 - is we're getting what the current value
54:20 - of check boxes is right checks boxes is
54:24 - now an object that contains key value
54:26 - pairs
54:27 - representing each checkbox the name is
54:30 - the key the value is true or false
54:33 - depending on whether it's checked or not
54:35 - so we're taking that we're modifying it
54:40 - and then
54:41 - we're combining it
54:44 - with this but do we need to combine it
54:46 - with that because we're not
54:50 - yeah we're not getting rid of this so i
54:52 - don't
54:54 - maybe we don't need to maybe we can just
54:56 - do this
54:57 - maybe that's that's rose
54:59 - i don't know if that's where i was
55:00 - messing up but i it was unnecessary
55:03 - let's double check and make sure it was
55:05 - unnecessary
55:19 - yeah
55:20 - let me give it a refresh here
55:30 - oops
55:35 - i need to remember what this is called
55:38 - or can i go like
55:39 - here
55:48 - there we go
55:55 - okay
55:56 - all right let's check it out now
55:58 - faculty
56:00 - there we go
56:02 - okay
56:04 - and i see i'm sure some of you in the
56:05 - live chat uh recognize my error first so
56:09 - thank you for that
56:11 - um
56:12 - okay so this works now
56:15 - so let me explain what's going on right
56:17 - now especially for those of you who
56:19 - might not be familiar with react i want
56:20 - to try to explain as much as i can
56:24 - so
56:26 - basically the same thing as i explained
56:27 - was happening before
56:29 - but now instead of trying to combine
56:32 - what was there which was an unnecessary
56:34 - step we're just setting state
56:37 - to this new value for the check boxes
56:40 - array
56:41 - i'm sorry the check box is object so
56:43 - this check boxes object here starts out
56:46 - with all the values being false
56:50 - we go down to here
56:52 - let's assume we just check
56:55 - a check box let's just say we check the
56:57 - box for faculty
56:59 - so
57:00 - it would pass the name faculty
57:03 - it would pass the events
57:06 - and then it would pass the value of
57:08 - checked
57:09 - which in this case the value of check
57:11 - then becomes true
57:15 - so in the check boxes object we're
57:18 - passing the name so we're going to get
57:20 - the checkbox
57:22 - item
57:24 - with the key value of faculty
57:28 - and we're going to set its value
57:30 - to true right because that's what the
57:32 - value of checked is now
57:34 - then we're going to do that set state
57:37 - and we're going to set our in our state
57:40 - the check boxes object
57:43 - that we've now updated
57:46 - we're sending that whole object there
57:48 - again
57:50 - and that's what's gonna update state
57:55 - uh so
57:57 - let's see so nikki says that way works
57:59 - but can cause asynchronous issues
58:03 - um
58:04 - i
58:05 - so in in what way can it cause issues
58:08 - i'm not denying that it causes issues i
58:10 - just i'm not aware of them
58:13 - so i guess what what issues does it
58:15 - cause and are these issues that we need
58:17 - to be
58:18 - careful of in this use case
58:23 - because if the issues aren't going to
58:25 - affect us in this use case i'm okay with
58:27 - leaving it like this even if it may not
58:28 - be the best way just for the sake of
58:30 - getting it done and moving on
58:33 - um
58:37 - nikki says set state is asynchronous
58:45 - okay
58:46 - so
58:50 - uh so nikki are you trying to say then
58:52 - that
58:53 - okay so set state here
58:56 - so potentially our search could run
58:58 - before set state
59:00 - and then it wouldn't
59:02 - have the right criteria
59:11 - i'm not i'm not sure if that's what
59:12 - you're saying so let me know
59:14 - if that's the case
59:22 - let's see
59:24 - i'm going to continue on just to see if
59:26 - we can make this work i do need to check
59:28 - my time we have nine
59:30 - okay almost 10 minutes
59:34 - so at this point
59:38 - let's get
59:53 - let's see nikki says
59:56 - the value in state can run one behind
59:58 - checkbox
60:02 - so you check it and it actually sets the
60:04 - state to false you uncheck it and it
60:07 - goes to true
60:11 - oh okay
60:13 - all right let's
60:26 - so how would i test that just click
60:28 - these a bunch of times really fast or
60:31 - is there a better way to test this
60:45 - okay nikki says it seems to be working
60:48 - all right we'll we'll just we'll have to
60:50 - keep that in mind and then maybe once we
60:52 - get it all working with more check boxes
60:54 - and things just check it again just to
60:57 - be sure
61:00 - all right so for now we need a way to
61:02 - get this search type
61:04 - to make it a string that we can put in
61:06 - here so
61:08 - let's let's search him
61:15 - let me think where should we
61:17 - make this
61:24 - um
61:40 - thank you
61:52 - i'm gonna make it a separate function
61:54 - right now i'm not sure that it needs to
61:56 - be but
61:57 - uh at least it'll
62:00 - it'll be more obvious what's happening
62:02 - if we make a separate function so we're
62:04 - gonna say
62:07 - create
62:10 - types
62:20 - okay not the best name in the world but
62:22 - it'll work
62:23 - create search types for now let's just
62:26 - put that in there
62:29 - and
62:31 - put that in there so
62:38 - basically let's
62:44 - search string
62:47 - equal
63:09 - all right i want to do this um
63:20 - tag is this
63:26 - string equals
63:28 - search string
63:36 - type this
63:48 - this is going to be
63:56 - value
64:12 - all right so
64:15 - what's the best way to loop through
64:17 - an object
64:20 - this always gets me what's the best for
64:23 - arrays and what's the best for objects
64:26 - i always forget so we don't want to use
64:28 - map on objects right
64:32 - but we can do
64:40 - we can do this right
64:45 - i don't know did we do this it comes
64:46 - from exhaustion
64:48 - this they form
64:58 - that's it object values yes i knew it
65:00 - thank you nikki
65:02 - i knew that there was a way to uh still
65:05 - use map with that that's what i was
65:07 - looking at the other project for
65:09 - i don't think we did it in the other
65:10 - project though okay so we're gonna you
65:13 - do
65:21 - object values
65:23 - um
65:30 - state check boxes dot
65:32 - map
65:34 - and we're gonna do
65:36 - um
65:46 - okay key
65:47 - value
66:09 - oops
66:14 - oops
66:45 - we're gonna do if
66:47 - um
66:51 - give value
66:54 - then
66:57 - search string
67:01 - equals
67:02 - [Music]
67:05 - key
67:10 - uh can i not do
67:11 - an if statement no i can't just return
67:13 - in this statement so i need to change
67:15 - this up
67:18 - now can i
67:21 - there we go
67:23 - okay
67:24 - let me
67:26 - and i can take
67:31 - yeah this shouldn't be there right
67:33 - yeah this one shouldn't be there
67:38 - but this one
67:42 - should be there
67:50 - right
67:54 - okay uh
67:56 - let me
67:57 - change your id value oh okay uh nikki i
68:00 - just saw that that message so let me
68:04 - switch this up here
68:10 - okay key value
68:15 - object entries okay object entries
68:22 - all right
68:23 - thank you and was that actually what
68:24 - we're using no we still weren't using it
68:26 - there where did we use that at i know we
68:28 - used it as at a project
68:32 - at some point
68:35 - object entries yeah so we definitely
68:37 - need both okay so let me go through
68:44 - let me go through this just to explain
68:46 - what we're doing
68:49 - um
68:53 - so we're we're taking this object
68:56 - and
68:58 - we're
69:00 - basically
69:01 - all right so this
69:04 - we're treating this object as if it were
69:07 - an array
69:08 - okay so that lets us map over it we're
69:10 - getting the key value pairs
69:13 - and then we're checking to see if the
69:15 - value is true
69:17 - which means the box is checked
69:19 - we're adding to the search string
69:24 - the and type
69:26 - and then we're putting that name of key
69:29 - so it'll search through everything here
69:32 - and create a string that's going to have
69:35 - all the values that we need
69:37 - to pass in
69:39 - here
69:41 - for our search types
69:43 - so that's the idea
69:46 - and then what we what we need to do
69:48 - though is um
69:52 - [Music]
69:54 - set
69:55 - state so
69:58 - this set states
70:06 - oops
70:10 - search string
70:15 - and this needs to be
70:19 - is that what we called it actually if we
70:21 - called it search string they were okay
70:23 - no we called it search tight didn't we
70:25 - okay
70:27 - um
70:28 - search
70:30 - type
70:31 - search string
70:33 - oops
70:40 - and let's do this
70:46 - let's do this here i don't think this is
70:48 - the best place to put it but let's do
70:49 - this here so we can see it building it
70:51 - uh every time that we we check this
70:54 - so
71:08 - all right so my timer is up and i do
71:10 - have a meeting very soon so i just want
71:12 - to test this out briefly
71:14 - where we can
71:16 - look at state
71:30 - there we are
71:32 - okay so the search term or search type
71:35 - is what should be changing when we do
71:37 - this
71:39 - there we go and we should get
71:42 - awesome okay check this out
71:45 - uh let me make it a little bigger whoa
71:48 - that's
71:49 - really big see we can see it okay but
71:51 - hopefully you can see it
71:53 - so what happened here so we checked both
71:55 - these boxes faculty and department so
71:57 - now we have research type of string
71:59 - that's and type department and type
72:02 - faculty
72:04 - and that's exactly what we need to pass
72:06 - in
72:09 - and so that that should work
72:12 - so unfortunately i don't have enough
72:14 - time to
72:16 - actually test this with a real search so
72:18 - i have to stop here
72:21 - but
72:22 - is creating the string as we want it so
72:27 - we did test the search with a string
72:30 - that was very similar to this
72:32 - and it worked
72:34 - so assuming
72:38 - i mean really it should work
72:40 - so should work isn't the same as does
72:42 - work but uh it's looking good so far
72:46 - let me
72:48 - scroll up to where he left off at
72:51 - and try to get through all these
72:53 - questions
72:54 - this is going to be a close one i'm
72:55 - going to do my best to get through the
72:57 - questions but if i don't get through
72:59 - them all i'm apologizing now and uh you
73:02 - can
73:03 - re-ask the question
73:04 - in the comments or you know send me a
73:06 - message on some social media platform or
73:09 - wait till the next stream
73:14 - uh stephen asks about what what is next
73:17 - js
73:19 - next js is very similar to create react
73:22 - app if you're familiar with that it just
73:24 - builds out a lot of the like boilerplate
73:27 - react stuff that you need
73:28 - it uh automatically has a webpack config
73:32 - the thing that i like about next.js is
73:34 - it comes with a basic router
73:37 - that lets you just create routes by
73:39 - putting components in a folder called
73:41 - pages
73:42 - and then it also comes built in with
73:44 - server side rendering
73:46 - so that's why we chose
73:48 - next for this project instead of create
73:50 - react app basically for the server side
73:53 - rendering
73:58 - chad says hello hey chad thanks for
74:00 - watching
74:03 - uh chris says which type of projects
74:05 - would warrant using react over other
74:07 - frameworks
74:08 - is it when you are handling state
74:11 - um
74:16 - yeah if if you need to handle state
74:20 - i think react is is a good choice so if
74:22 - you're building just like a one-page
74:24 - website
74:26 - you don't really need react you could
74:28 - definitely use react if you wanted to
74:31 - i built really basic things with react
74:33 - you know mainly for practice
74:36 - but
74:37 - if you were building more of a web app
74:40 - where you would have
74:42 - you know things changing uh if you want
74:46 - kind of like an easy way to handle
74:48 - client-side routing
74:50 - in your web app
74:52 - uh using like react with something like
74:54 - react router
74:56 - just makes it so much easier than trying
74:58 - to create your own routing system
75:01 - whether in vanilla js or jquery or
75:04 - something like that
75:06 - so
75:07 - that's when i would use it react isn't
75:09 - the only option though
75:11 - there are a lot of people using vue for
75:13 - that same sort of thing
75:15 - some people prefer
75:17 - something like angular
75:21 - so
75:22 - that's what i would use it for if
75:24 - there's definitely like a blurry line as
75:26 - to like well when do i need a framework
75:29 - and when do i not need a framework and
75:30 - so you're gonna find different answers
75:32 - to that question depending on what
75:33 - article you read or what video you watch
75:36 - um so i generally say if you want to
75:39 - learn a framework
75:40 - do a really basic project even if it
75:42 - seems like overkill because you'll get
75:44 - practice
75:45 - uh you know don't try to tackle some
75:47 - huge thing first if you're just trying
75:49 - to learn
75:50 - uh later on you know then you you get a
75:53 - hang of what it could do
75:56 - and then you'll know
75:58 - when that particular framework is going
76:00 - to be useful or when it'll just be
76:02 - more than you need
76:12 - so
76:22 - so
76:37 - okay uh saksham said the words are a
76:40 - little small please zoom a bit
76:42 - okay hopefully i i did make things
76:44 - bigger in dev tool so i'm hoping that
76:47 - that it did help you out uh sorry about
76:49 - that
76:51 - uh nino asks is there a method in react
76:54 - that gets called when you set the state
76:56 - and use the class component
77:00 - that it's called uh component did mount
77:04 - yes there is a component did mount uh so
77:06 - anything inside component did mount will
77:08 - run
77:09 - when the component has mounted
77:12 - right just like it says and there are
77:14 - other those are called life cycle
77:15 - methods so if you type in react
77:18 - lifecycle methods you should get
77:20 - as one of the search results a list of
77:23 - all the different life cycle methods
77:24 - that are available so there's like
77:26 - component will mount component did mount
77:29 - those are the two that i've mainly used
77:31 - there are others
77:33 - i can't remember them off the top of my
77:35 - head right now
77:37 - um
77:39 - but yes they're
77:41 - they are very helpful
77:52 - oh nikki says on that routing very
77:54 - interested to hear also please feedback
77:56 - on pr from a week ago pull requests oh
77:59 - i'm sorry nikki i just i totally forgot
78:02 - about that
78:03 - uh i will take a look at that pr
78:06 - before i make changes to the routing
78:09 - um
78:10 - i wish i had time right now to explain
78:12 - more to you i'll have to explain on
78:14 - tomorrow's stream or something like that
78:16 - uh but the changes i want to make
78:20 - i think they should fit in
78:22 - pretty easily with what's already there
78:24 - with just like very very minimal
78:27 - um changes so
78:29 - hopefully
78:31 - we can integrate your changes from that
78:33 - pr and you know maybe my changes if
78:36 - they're even needed
78:38 - um and we can make it do what we want
78:41 - basically there's just a lot more
78:42 - complexity to the url structure as i
78:44 - keep digging into it that i'm finding
78:47 - so
78:49 - uh i i was just
78:51 - had thought up a way to
78:54 - deal with that complexity um
78:57 - in in kind of a different way and let us
79:00 - handle it and still keep things
79:03 - the look of it kind of
79:05 - simple and easy to figure out what's
79:06 - going on as much as we can
79:09 - all right thank you so much everyone uh
79:12 - for watching and for all the help uh you
79:15 - all helped me so much in the stream
79:16 - today
79:18 - uh
79:18 - i i definitely appreciate it
79:21 - uh oh one more question is that sublime
79:23 - text no this is visual studio code
79:26 - uh
79:27 - okay
79:28 - all right so i really do i have to go
79:30 - and uh and get to another meeting i
79:33 - should be back tomorrow
79:35 - for another stream we'll probably be
79:37 - working on this again
79:39 - uh or maybe the router we'll see
79:43 - ah let's see
79:47 - oh nikki
79:49 - nikki i see that comment that's exactly
79:51 - what i was thinking of doing so i'm
79:54 - definitely going to look at your code
79:57 - i can't believe
79:59 - all right
80:02 - i can't believe you both thought of this
80:03 - we both thought of the same solution i
80:05 - mean you thought of it a week before i
80:06 - did
80:07 - but
80:08 - i should have just looked at that pull
80:10 - request all right i would definitely
80:11 - check it out
80:13 - and uh i may not even need to do what i
80:15 - was thinking of doing
80:16 - uh i could
80:18 - probably just do what you did
80:24 - sorry about that
80:25 - all right i'll be back tomorrow thank
80:27 - you for watching thank you for all your
80:28 - help
80:29 - you all are awesome
80:31 - and
80:33 - until tomorrow
80:35 - have a wonderful day
