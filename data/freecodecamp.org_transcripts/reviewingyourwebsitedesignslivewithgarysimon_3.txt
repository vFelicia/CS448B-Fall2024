00:59 - better behave yourself
01:01 - all right now they're just coming in too
01:03 - quick but yeah we're going to get
01:05 - started very soon very excited for this
01:08 - we already have 110 people watching
01:11 - all right
01:16 - all right logical programmer the first
01:18 - high was enough
01:24 - all righty i'm excited
01:29 - from brazil
01:33 - hello hello
01:35 - if you want to see my discord server you
01:37 - can go to my youtube channel which i'll
01:38 - show you in a second
01:45 - all right
01:46 - wow 363 already watching
01:51 - all right
01:52 - awesome so you know what
01:55 - i think we're going to go ahead
01:57 - and get started
01:59 - all right so first of all for those of
02:00 - you who don't know me and many of you do
02:03 - because i have my own youtube channel
02:04 - i've been doing this forever for the
02:06 - last 10 years i'm gary simon i've been a
02:08 - ui ux developer and
02:11 - a front-end developer as well did i say
02:14 - ui ux developer i should say designer
02:16 - and you and a front-end developer as
02:17 - well for the last 20 years and i've
02:21 - been an instructor for the last 10 years
02:24 - and i've produced many courses um over
02:27 - 800 videos on my own youtube channel and
02:30 - my goal is just to help people become
02:32 - better designers and
02:34 - front-end developers but for this stream
02:36 - we're not going to be focused on
02:38 - front-end development at all which is
02:39 - strange because we're coming from free
02:41 - code camp right um that's why i thought
02:44 - it would be really interesting to do a
02:46 - live stream here where i introduced some
02:48 - design concepts and the understanding of
02:51 - ui design fundamentals to for those of
02:53 - you who are front-end developers or just
02:55 - programmers who have an interest in
02:57 - design all right so
02:59 - right here i'm showing you at this site
03:01 - designcourse.com it's going to be
03:03 - relaunching very soon in several months
03:05 - time if you want to learn and you want
03:08 - to be able to be notified when this
03:09 - officially launches we're working on a
03:11 - hard now enter your email go to
03:13 - designcourse.com and you will be
03:14 - notified when it launches so here is my
03:17 - youtube channel you can also i check
03:19 - this out it's just design course the
03:21 - link is here in the description of this
03:23 - video and go ahead subscribe up watch my
03:26 - channel i'm uh usually uploading twice a
03:28 - week along with am i i do a live ui ux
03:32 - review usually
03:34 - once uh a week maybe sometimes once
03:37 - every two weeks so it i'm gonna be doing
03:39 - the same sh i do the same show all the
03:40 - time on my own channel so if you like
03:42 - this go ahead and check that out
03:44 - and now we're going to talk about you
03:46 - know i
03:48 - something that plagues a lot of uh
03:50 - beginning designers or perhaps if you're
03:52 - a front end developer or a programmer
03:54 - already and you want to be able to
03:55 - design so i'm going to first talk about
03:57 - something that's going to sound really
03:59 - unrelated
04:01 - tennis
04:02 - all right so i'm sure many of you if you
04:04 - ever tried to play tennis or golf or
04:07 - bowling or any new sport
04:09 - you're terrible at it at first i mean
04:11 - your first time you show up you're not
04:13 - sure how to hold the racket hopefully
04:14 - you know at least to hold the handle or
04:16 - the grip i but you're just terrible at
04:19 - it right
04:20 - and it's interesting because when it
04:22 - comes to ui design
04:25 - you're able to
04:26 - watch and you're able to look at another
04:29 - great design you're able to observe and
04:31 - say hey that's a great design you're
04:32 - able to look at a tennis player like
04:34 - roger federer and say hey this guy is a
04:37 - great player so we're great at observing
04:41 - design
04:42 - in sports in greatness
04:44 - i but we're terrible at creating it so
04:48 - why is that well
04:50 - simply because you lack the muscle
04:52 - memory and you also lack the
04:53 - fundamentals the understanding of the
04:55 - fundamentals so
04:57 - when it comes to ui design
05:00 - the reason that you can observe and say
05:01 - hey that's a great design but you can't
05:03 - create it yourself is because you lack
05:04 - the
05:05 - fundamentals you lack the understanding
05:07 - of ui fundamentals and you also probably
05:11 - lack the muscle memory you haven't done
05:13 - it enough all right so
05:15 - my goal in this stream is going to be to
05:18 - help you
05:20 - pinpoint the areas where you're failing
05:22 - in your designs all right and so this i
05:24 - can do this very quickly i could take a
05:26 - look at most of these lines i i haven't
05:28 - seen yet and i'm going to be able to say
05:30 - okay this is wrong this is wrong that's
05:31 - wrong and so
05:33 - this is going to help you understand
05:35 - even if i'm not look
05:37 - if even if i'm not critiquing your own
05:38 - designs you're going to be able to
05:41 - basically
05:42 - you're going to benefit from it even
05:44 - though i'm going to be looking at other
05:46 - people's designs so don't get dis
05:47 - discouraged if your design wasn't chosen
05:50 - so first of all how do you submit your
05:52 - design well you just go to twitter and
05:55 - the hashtag live ui ux review it's also
05:58 - mentioned here
06:00 - right
06:01 - there that's the hashtag that you want
06:03 - to use live ui ux review and just submit
06:06 - uh your design it could be a live
06:08 - website
06:09 - i it could be maybe a figma prototype or
06:12 - it could be an adobe xd prototype or
06:15 - whatever it could just be a flat jpeg
06:17 - mockup screenshot it's it's really i'm
06:19 - not too picky about that all right so we
06:22 - already have a few that we're gonna get
06:23 - started with so the very first actually
06:25 - the very first entry came from roxanna
06:29 - and this is uh what she produced
06:33 - right so we're going to close these
06:35 - tennis players out
06:38 - all right so this is her design as you
06:39 - can see we're going down here oh by the
06:41 - way i will also ask you guys to rate it
06:44 - so in the chat here in youtube i'm going
06:46 - to ask you to rate these designs from a
06:48 - scale of one to ten and i'm not gonna
06:50 - look at your answers i'm not purposely
06:52 - going to not look at your the uh the
06:54 - youtube chat and then i'm gonna see if
06:56 - my answer aligns with yours all right so
06:59 - we'll get to that here in a second so i
07:02 - this is i'm not really sure exactly
07:04 - about what's happening uh it's obviously
07:06 - like a nutrition uh maybe a diet sort of
07:09 - site a service of some sort
07:11 - but i can notice a couple things right
07:14 - away that are immediately wrong
07:17 - first off is the navigation the
07:19 - navigation you can see the links are
07:21 - home about us
07:23 - in meals however there's not enough
07:26 - white space so when i was talking about
07:28 - ui design fundamentals and how it's so
07:30 - important to understand those things
07:32 - white space or sometimes referred to as
07:34 - negative space is one of those ui design
07:36 - fundamentals so
07:38 - there's not enough white space between
07:41 - these elements so if i kind of uh
07:44 - try to scale this up a little bit more
07:46 - you see there's hardly any white space
07:47 - up here they're really cramped together
07:49 - so that that that makes it difficult to
07:51 - use which results in a ux issue a user
07:54 - experience issue so you want to spread
07:56 - those out further away from each other
07:58 - first and foremost
07:59 - second off i would say it's a little bit
08:00 - strange to have this large area right
08:03 - here
08:04 - i
08:06 - get out of here what are you doing
08:08 - i'm trying to get that off there we go
08:10 - all right this large circle right here
08:12 - so i would definitely
08:14 - scale that down because it's just it's
08:16 - taking a lot of attention away from the
08:18 - eye to an area that's not that important
08:21 - the search bar is not that important
08:23 - next up we see we have this really cool
08:25 - i like the design here and the the
08:26 - creativity it's kind of like a graphic
08:28 - design this is a strong part of this
08:31 - page here so far um but i think what
08:34 - needs
08:34 - to help to
08:36 - be addressed here a little bit more so
08:38 - is having a call to action you should
08:40 - always have an area where it's
08:42 - immediately identifiable
08:44 - where the user should go whether that's
08:47 - to click a link fill out a form or
08:49 - scroll down now we do see right here it
08:51 - says scroll down with a tiny little
08:55 - arrow but that's not obvious enough so
08:57 - you'd want to maybe perhaps take that
08:59 - scroll down area right here put it
09:02 - maybe underneath this lorem ipsum text
09:04 - this descriptor and
09:07 - with when you get into html and css
09:09 - maybe make it anime up and down to catch
09:11 - the tension of the eye
09:12 - all right so coming down further you
09:14 - would probably want to avoid big walls
09:17 - of text like this um and also if you do
09:20 - have two paragraphs which you do you
09:21 - want to create that white space that's
09:23 - separation between them
09:25 - coming down further
09:27 - this part is pretty good like i said
09:29 - though a lot of people when they're on a
09:31 - landing page and for a service or an app
09:33 - or a website of some sort they don't
09:35 - want to read a ton when they're on the
09:37 - landing page they're just kind of
09:38 - scrolling down so i would probably
09:39 - reduce the number of uh
09:42 - words that you have here in the verbiage
09:45 - um yeah and this is a pretty pretty good
09:48 - though there's a lot of good things
09:49 - happening i like the colors though uh
09:52 - the color and contrast all is working
09:54 - well i like the use of photographs so
09:56 - there's a lot of good things happening
09:57 - here so what do you think this person
10:00 - should get for a rating let me know in
10:02 - the chat one being the worst and then 10
10:04 - being the best and then i will let you
10:06 - know here in about 10 to 15 seconds
10:08 - about what i think this one should be
10:09 - rated
10:13 - i should have the the uh jeopardy or
10:16 - wait is that yeah the jeopardy
10:20 - okay i won't sing again sorry about that
10:23 - for me
10:24 - i'm gonna go ahead
10:26 - and
10:27 - rate this one
10:30 - which i see nobody is bothering to rate
10:33 - it
10:35 - there we go we got run one rating i'm
10:37 - going to give this one
10:43 - there is a lot of white space in between
10:45 - here probably too much between this as
10:47 - well
10:52 - okay i'm going to give this one a
10:58 - 6.6 yes i'm doing decimals somebody said
11:01 - 6.5 they got very close
11:04 - but yeah pretty solid overall so thank
11:07 - you for that submission roxanna
11:09 - all right so next up
11:11 - we have from a user of sama
11:16 - let's click this
11:18 - all right
11:22 - i'm going to refresh these just so if
11:25 - there's any animation we'll see it
11:29 - all right
11:30 - so this is from assam and this is a by
11:33 - and it feels like i need to right here
11:35 - we're at 100 zoom the default zoom
11:38 - i'm going to go ahead and
11:40 - increase this it feels like
11:42 - at this viewport width which is you know
11:45 - i'm on a 4k resolution monitor i
11:48 - there's too much white space
11:50 - around here so you want to fill this out
11:52 - more and make sure you're adhering to
11:54 - because this is an html css javascript
11:56 - already you want to make sure you're
11:58 - you're really
11:59 - targeting all of the potential uh
12:03 - viewport or the resolutions
12:06 - and i feel like you can probably fill
12:08 - out the space more by making these a
12:10 - little bit larger first and foremost so
12:12 - you remember
12:13 - uh in the previous entry when i talked
12:15 - about having a call to action
12:18 - we are lacking a call to action here
12:20 - entirely so first of all there's nowhere
12:22 - i can't scroll down on this so it's just
12:24 - that this one page right here or the
12:26 - above the fold so to speak um so i can't
12:29 - scroll down and all we have here is a an
12:32 - area
12:33 - um where it says you know if you have
12:35 - any questions uh or any queries feel
12:37 - free to get in touch on twitter or via
12:39 - email i'm going to make this a little
12:41 - bit larger so we can all see it and then
12:43 - the email or the call to action right
12:45 - here is just a plain text it's not even
12:48 - an ahref mail to form so it's not even a
12:50 - clickable link i
12:52 - this is the email
12:54 - so this is a really bad call to action
12:57 - uh because you want to make it as easy
12:58 - as possible for people to contact you
13:00 - especially on the context of your
13:02 - portfolio where you're trying to get
13:04 - work you don't want people so this isn't
13:07 - a ux issue this has nothing to do with
13:08 - ui design um you don't want people have
13:11 - to work extra in order to hire you or
13:13 - contact you
13:14 - for a quote or just to hire you so
13:18 - at the very least make this a clickable
13:20 - link
13:21 - but even more so than that the ideal
13:23 - approach for here for this situation
13:26 - is i would completely get rid of the
13:28 - email
13:29 - and i would put in a section an actual
13:33 - clickable button that looks like an
13:34 - identifiable button that really stands
13:36 - out like a call to action button should
13:38 - uh where
13:40 - people click on it to view your work
13:43 - why would somebody contact you
13:45 - if they don't know if they haven't seen
13:47 - your portfolio so that's a big thing
13:50 - here so in terms of
13:53 - i in ux there's something called
13:54 - information architecture also in terms
13:57 - of ad copy i i wouldn't be directing
13:59 - them to just contact you right away you
14:02 - do have a link up here to your portfolio
14:04 - but that's not good enough you you want
14:07 - to make this main hero section as it's
14:09 - called this whole section up here you
14:11 - want to make it directed uh and really
14:13 - focused on the area that makes most
14:16 - sense for what the user wants all right
14:19 - and sometimes you know we have to make
14:20 - assumptions but when it comes to you
14:23 - user experience design you'd also want
14:26 - to get feedback from real users and say
14:29 - hey
14:30 - what are you most interested in seeing
14:32 - uh is it is it my email address or is it
14:34 - maybe my portfolio so i've done enough
14:37 - of these to know that it's the portfolio
14:38 - that's the work that they want to see
14:40 - the most so put a link to your portfolio
14:42 - or a button that's real identifiable as
14:45 - an actual button
14:46 - and then also i would put maybe a
14:49 - secondary
14:51 - call to action because you can have two
14:52 - of them to your actual
14:55 - i would say
14:56 - email address or a way to contact you
14:58 - also another side note when it comes to
15:01 - your portfolios
15:02 - always have a way for them to contact
15:04 - you with a form on your website all
15:06 - right don't just put in an email address
15:09 - or make them click this to to load up
15:11 - their email
15:12 - why they could be on their phones and
15:14 - maybe their email client or they don't
15:15 - have an email map app that's set up on
15:17 - their phone so that's a missed
15:19 - opportunity they might forget when they
15:20 - get home always have a form on your
15:23 - portfolio so people can contact you all
15:25 - right so
15:27 - that's really maybe mainly this is a ux
15:30 - issue for the most part looking at the
15:32 - ui design and and how it's actually
15:34 - designed it's it's not too bad i don't
15:36 - see anything that's really coming out
15:38 - and just you know being hundred percent
15:40 - wrong but these are major ux issues here
15:43 - so given what we've seen here what do
15:46 - you think this person should get for our
15:47 - rating one being the worst and 10 being
15:49 - the very best we'll see if most of you
15:51 - agree
16:05 - all right
16:06 - let's see i think you know i'm going to
16:08 - be factoring in the issues of the ux so
16:12 - this isn't just about what it looks like
16:14 - it's about you know those ux issues as
16:16 - well so on a scale of one to ten
16:19 - i'm probably going to rate this one
16:24 - a
16:25 - i can see you guys are i'm not trying
16:27 - i'm not looking at your your answers yet
16:29 - i don't i don't want to be influenced by
16:31 - other people i'm i'm just going to say
16:34 - a flat out
16:40 - four
16:41 - all right now if i were only looking at
16:44 - the ui design you know it would be a
16:46 - little bit higher than that not much
16:49 - higher but
16:50 - the ux issues were hurting it for me and
16:52 - it looks like a lot of you i pretty much
16:54 - agree i see a seven up here i see uh
16:58 - threes a bunch of threes actually so it
17:01 - looks like we were pretty much agreeing
17:02 - for the most part all right so let's
17:05 - close that one off and
17:07 - i'm going to pick out the next one and
17:10 - again if you want to submit your design
17:11 - i'm probably not going to get to it
17:12 - because we have so many entries already
17:15 - we you can go ahead to twitter though
17:17 - and do a live ui ux review hashtag with
17:20 - your entry
17:22 - so
17:23 - let's click on the next one
17:26 - [Music]
17:27 - all right i made this website for a
17:30 - school please check it out this is from
17:32 - ahmed
17:36 - all right
17:38 - so what i think when i see this design
17:40 - which by the way i haven't seen it yet
17:42 - this is the first time
17:43 - i'm looking
17:45 - i i i think to myself
17:49 - kind of a little bit boring and bland um
17:51 - with the gallery just kind of like a
17:53 - gallery starting right away
17:55 - i i think it doesn't have much semblance
17:57 - of a structure structured ui design
18:00 - where
18:01 - you know you're utilizing like a hero
18:03 - section to do something interesting and
18:05 - say something interesting a lot of
18:07 - people
18:08 - if they didn't know exactly
18:11 - what type of site this was which i do
18:14 - because it's for school you told me
18:15 - already they wouldn't know right away
18:17 - what this site is about
18:19 - we i really wouldn't know i i don't know
18:22 - what's happening by the the logo
18:24 - so you're making people guess and again
18:27 - this comes down to a ux issue i you want
18:30 - people to know within the first couple
18:33 - seconds
18:34 - what this site is about
18:36 - i all i see is somebody who's giving a
18:38 - speech it may not have anything to do
18:40 - with school so that's one of the things
18:42 - you want to address with a strong
18:44 - headline
18:45 - your ad copy is very very important uh
18:48 - the copy that you use on your site a
18:50 - strong headline sometimes you can use a
18:52 - sub headline as well to
18:54 - to elaborate a little bit more um but
18:56 - just having a photograph here i just i
18:58 - wouldn't do that i try to try to
19:01 - actually formulate it into a situation
19:03 - where you have a nice hero section um
19:06 - you can still use a photograph maybe
19:08 - as
19:09 - as a watermark photograph or something
19:11 - like that there's a lot of ways you
19:12 - could approach it but you want to
19:13 - address what this site is about
19:16 - so i we have pre-grade primary secondary
19:19 - checking this out clubs and societies
19:23 - all right so one thing here
19:25 - on this resolution
19:26 - i we're
19:28 - looking at just the kind of the desktop
19:31 - portion
19:32 - all these uh little blips where you have
19:35 - a title and then the description
19:37 - uh you could put those side by side in
19:39 - at least two columns that way you can
19:41 - save up vertical space
19:43 - instead of having it all listed out you
19:46 - would do this
19:47 - for instance on
19:49 - the mobile version because you just
19:51 - don't have enough space to put them side
19:53 - by side but you want to
19:55 - make sure or you're really wisely using
19:58 - all the space that you have available
20:00 - and then of course if you went all the
20:01 - way out here
20:03 - then you could possibly if you weren't
20:04 - using a fixed container here you could
20:07 - possibly use three columns all right
20:15 - all right so i think that's a good
20:16 - review and outline of what's happening
20:18 - here
20:19 - the type here for the most part is
20:21 - pretty good
20:22 - it's a very simple design so it doesn't
20:24 - necessarily mean that it's bad it's a
20:26 - bad ui design or a bad ux design
20:28 - actually simple is great for you user
20:31 - experience purposes
20:33 - but i think the the one issue here is
20:35 - what i mentioned first and that is an
20:37 - issue of
20:39 - ux i you want to address what people are
20:42 - doing so what do you guys think this
20:43 - person should get factoring in the ui
20:45 - and the uxi issues or the non-issues for
20:49 - this design one being the worst and 10
20:51 - being the very best
21:03 - i'll give you guys a few seconds to get
21:05 - your answers in
21:18 - and for me
21:20 - yeah by the way try not to spam too much
21:22 - there
21:23 - you there's no reason to spam your
21:25 - answers don't worry i'm not picking out
21:27 - any of you individually
21:29 - to say uh you know i i'm there's no
21:32 - reason to spam please don't do that
21:35 - just sit your answer once that's it
21:38 - all right so for me i'm gonna give this
21:40 - one
21:41 - yeah again we're probably gonna have to
21:42 - rate it on a little bit of lower side
21:44 - just because you know the ux issues and
21:46 - the ui design could be improved so i'm
21:49 - gonna give this one here
21:51 - just a flat out
21:56 - 4.8 or so maybe around five it looks
22:00 - like i'm i'm actually being a little bit
22:02 - nicer than you guys
22:04 - or girl sorry
22:05 - um
22:06 - so yeah thank you for that submission
22:08 - the next one up is going to be from
22:13 - i let's see ammer
22:16 - and
22:17 - this one actually looks pretty
22:19 - impressive so let's check it out
22:22 - all right
22:27 - all right so i'm going to refresh just
22:28 - to see if there's any initial
22:31 - animation there is a loading screen
22:32 - right here
22:34 - all right so i program websites i create
22:36 - websites
22:38 - i develop websites
22:41 - a little bit
22:42 - i would probably change
22:44 - i would change that up a little bit
22:45 - because some of those are a little bit
22:47 - redundant create and develop uh maybe
22:49 - design if you do design
22:52 - um what i thought was uh pretty
22:53 - impressive about this is right here i am
22:57 - a 15 years old front end web developer
23:00 - so this is a 15 year old who made this
23:03 - and it looks pretty nice so definitely
23:06 - i like what i see here especially from a
23:09 - 15 year old one thing i thought was a
23:11 - little bit too small just a tad bit on
23:13 - the small end is it's the type here on
23:15 - this resolution you should probably be
23:17 - up right around here so it's a little
23:20 - bit enlarged so i had to use my my
23:22 - browser zoom i'm at 150 so that's one
23:24 - thing to think about
23:26 - um
23:27 - the call to action they definitely have
23:29 - a good call to action that stands out
23:31 - pretty well i personally would probably
23:33 - make it filled in by default and not
23:34 - outlined just so it sticks out just a
23:36 - tad bit more but that's that's me
23:37 - splitting hairs um
23:40 - i program so i like the headline it's a
23:42 - pretty pretty unique headline
23:44 - and then he expands a little bit further
23:46 - on about you know what exactly exactly
23:48 - his expertises are which is a front-end
23:50 - web developer specialist at vue.js and a
23:53 - freelancer so this is pretty solid
23:56 - um i just think it needs to be a little
23:57 - bit larger
23:59 - so
24:00 - about me for me personally i think that
24:03 - should be work we want to say portfolio
24:05 - more than we want to know so much about
24:07 - you um so you could put two you could
24:09 - put two uh buttons in here and one could
24:12 - be outlined and then one could be filled
24:13 - in because you do want to have a primary
24:15 - call to action and that's emphasized
24:17 - through your ui design
24:19 - so
24:21 - let's see what else i
24:23 - latest projects
24:25 - all right
24:28 - simple enough
24:30 - sometimes it's nice to have these kind
24:32 - of in card formats um
24:35 - so that they're not not just flat out
24:37 - screenshots that are placed on here um
24:40 - there's a lot of different ways but i i
24:42 - would suggest go into google and type in
24:44 - ui design
24:47 - cards and you might get uh some other
24:49 - ideas to to more interesting ideas to to
24:52 - showcase the thumbnails and the
24:54 - information along with them but this is
24:56 - pretty this is this is not that bad i
24:58 - mean i hover over it i can see this
25:00 - sometimes people instead of requiring a
25:02 - person to hover they'll put that at the
25:04 - bottom of the card that way all the
25:06 - information is right there and you're
25:07 - not requiring extra action on behalf of
25:09 - the visitor
25:10 - um coming down here
25:13 - this is pretty good i
25:18 - so another ui design fundamental that's
25:20 - extremely important for everybody to
25:22 - understand is what's called visual
25:26 - hierarchy all right i talk about this
25:28 - all the time and if you're a coder and
25:30 - you're new to ui design you probably
25:32 - never heard of it but visual hierarchy
25:34 - isn't just specific to ui design it
25:36 - applies to all sorts of design like
25:37 - graphic design and print design all that
25:39 - stuff
25:40 - and when it comes to visual hierarchy
25:43 - what we're talking about is we're using
25:46 - our ui design principles our
25:48 - fundamentals in order to place
25:51 - uh
25:52 - emphasis on the most important elements
25:54 - and also to separate elements visually
25:57 - from each other so visual hierarchy i
26:01 - is very important to get right in terms
26:02 - of your typography so what i mean is we
26:06 - have web design here it's a larger font
26:08 - size so the scale that's another ui
26:10 - design fundamental
26:12 - and it's bold
26:14 - i
26:15 - it's larger than these elements right
26:17 - here so you could see there's a clear
26:19 - separation between
26:21 - the title and then also
26:24 - the little informational blips
26:26 - underneath them sometimes you can you
26:29 - can even further
26:31 - uh create a further separation between
26:33 - two different elements in order to
26:35 - create that visual hierarchy through
26:38 - color and contrast even so i can take
26:40 - out my browser tools
26:42 - and i can come down here
26:44 - and
26:45 - we could change this color maybe to
26:47 - slightly less white a little bit less
26:50 - contrast and that will create a further
26:51 - separation between those elements
26:53 - visually which reinforces the visual
26:56 - hierarchy so let me show you so we come
26:59 - down a little bit now if we go down all
27:01 - like this
27:02 - way too much we can see there's a
27:03 - massive separation now between the title
27:06 - and these blips underneath them but
27:08 - that's
27:09 - really bad for people who don't have
27:12 - great eyesight you know they have visual
27:14 - impairments so you want to make sure you
27:16 - adhere to a minimum
27:19 - contrast rating uh the wcag 2.0 go ahead
27:23 - and research that it's the minimum
27:25 - contrast ratios that you should have i
27:28 - so but we can come out maybe right
27:30 - around here if we go up here you can see
27:32 - they kind of blend together the title
27:34 - and the description or these these the
27:36 - subtitles if you will but if we come
27:38 - down here
27:40 - it creates a nice little separation
27:42 - between the two even further so
27:44 - so that's just something to keep in mind
27:47 - i might also
27:48 - take these these are paragraphs and
27:51 - they're separated by
27:53 - break elements i would probably change
27:55 - that because these are lists this is the
27:57 - front-end development topic now
27:59 - i would change these into unordered
28:00 - lists because this is what they are but
28:02 - the reason i'm mentioning that is
28:04 - because you could probably separate
28:05 - those out a little bit further a little
28:07 - bit more white space
28:09 - vertically between each other
28:12 - the contact me all right so this is
28:14 - extremely important
28:16 - i'm really interested in what's going to
28:18 - happen when i click on
28:21 - one of these text fields
28:23 - let's see
28:25 - enter your name
28:28 - don't want to do that you want to have
28:30 - at least a floating label if you're
28:32 - going to have like this placeholder item
28:34 - right here you want to have it floating
28:36 - meaning that when you click on it
28:38 - it will automatically transition above
28:41 - the text field because it's a ux issue
28:45 - again it's an accessibility issue
28:48 - because when you're you should never
28:49 - rely just on placeholder values for your
28:52 - your text fields and your form elements
28:56 - i the reason being if i start typing out
28:59 - my name
29:02 - well i don't my name isn't
29:04 - my name is gary i
29:06 - maybe for some reason i come back or i
29:08 - forget maybe i have memory issues
29:11 - all of a sudden now i have no clue what
29:14 - this text input is about
29:16 - because there's no label there
29:18 - so the best way to to fix this problem
29:21 - either use floating labels or just use a
29:23 - dedicated label that's always visible
29:26 - and your form will be your forms will
29:28 - perform much better
29:30 - all right so good call to action for the
29:32 - send button here
29:35 - and yeah i think that's enough time on
29:36 - this one what do you guys think this
29:38 - person should get a rating for uh one
29:40 - being the worst and 10 being the best
29:52 - you could put your answers in on the
29:54 - chat and
29:56 - you'll see how we'll see how close we
29:58 - align together
30:02 - yeah there's no super chats here that's
30:04 - for sure
30:12 - okay i like what i like the dark theme i
30:15 - really do um
30:16 - the contrast is all working well
30:19 - a lot of things are going right but
30:21 - nobody gets better if i just talk about
30:23 - what's right all the time i really like
30:25 - this section
30:27 - this is this is done well
30:29 - for me i'm going to go ahead and give
30:31 - this one a rating of
30:34 - let's see how it behaves responsively
30:37 - that's good
30:38 - i like what i saw there
30:42 - i'm just going to give this one a
30:47 - it will be our highest rating so far
30:49 - i'm going to give it like a 6.8 6.9
30:54 - very good
30:55 - thank you for that submission
30:59 - all right
31:03 - so next up
31:05 - we have from a user i build a bitcoin
31:09 - wallet where users can send and receive
31:11 - bitcoins with django check it out and if
31:14 - you like it you can check out the
31:15 - tutorial i made on how to build a
31:17 - similar site on my channel okay
31:19 - they're using some promotion here all
31:21 - right so it's called ging wallet
31:24 - ging wallet alrighty
31:27 - let's refresh this to see if anything
31:29 - interesting is happening
31:31 - all right so
31:34 - these carousels um
31:37 - on hero sections
31:39 - i would
31:40 - opt to completely i would get rid of
31:43 - that
31:45 - one thing that's a big issue as well is
31:47 - the
31:48 - the photographs they're just redundant
31:50 - um they just they're just bitcoins they
31:52 - all look the same i would get rid of
31:55 - that completely
31:56 - instead i would just use keep your keep
31:59 - your headline one of these headlines
32:01 - here have a sub headline
32:03 - and
32:04 - if you want people to create an account
32:05 - now
32:07 - well
32:08 - have that be a part of your hero section
32:11 - right here
32:12 - definitely do that so
32:14 - notice create an account now but it's
32:16 - not linked anywhere
32:18 - what is that about
32:20 - so you're going to require people
32:22 - unfortunately to go up here and click
32:24 - register
32:25 - uh
32:26 - in order to get their account set up so
32:31 - by the way why is that
32:32 - why is that what i can't even see
32:34 - register the type so there's there's a
32:36 - huge contrast that should be white
32:39 - so why not i can guarantee you if if
32:42 - you're sending traffic to this website
32:44 - right now which you're probably not um
32:47 - but if you were and this is what you
32:48 - were launching with i would be able to
32:50 - take your sign ups
32:52 - probably increase them by like 500
32:55 - percent if we restructured this whole
32:58 - section right here and you got a person
33:01 - to put in maybe one of those form fields
33:03 - like the register perhaps with an email
33:07 - um and then like a get started i that
33:10 - way you're utilizing it's so so much
33:13 - better um so that's my that's my review
33:16 - for here what do you guys think this
33:17 - person should get
33:19 - for a rating one being the worst and 10
33:21 - being the best
33:28 - now me i'm i'm reading some of the
33:29 - comments i'm not trying to i'm not
33:31 - trying to ascertain if this is legit or
33:33 - not i'm just looking at the ui ux solely
33:38 - don't go here and actually use this site
33:40 - i want it it's not even secure
33:46 - for me i'm going to go ahead and give
33:47 - this based on what i see
33:50 - probably a
33:54 - maybe like a 2.9
33:57 - or a three or so
34:01 - all right
34:02 - now uh let's check out another one
34:07 - we have another personal portfolio
34:10 - so let's check this out
34:12 - casper
34:13 - the ghost
34:14 - dot me
34:16 - all right
34:17 - so there was some animation let's
34:19 - refresh it
34:21 - all right so one thing right off the bat
34:23 - that's a little bit too fast
34:25 - refresh casper irvinson web developer
34:29 - make it stick around maybe a one to two
34:31 - seconds a little bit more if you're
34:33 - going to have something like that anyhow
34:35 - in the first place
34:36 - all right so
34:38 - visual hierarchy that's one of the
34:39 - things i was talking about
34:41 - this is a good visual hierarchy between
34:43 - these two elements
34:44 - the the person's name
34:46 - which is kind of like a label
34:48 - and then front-end focused web
34:50 - developers so those are done pretty well
34:52 - however
34:53 - we have all the space vertically um
34:56 - what we want to do
34:58 - to fix
34:59 - this issue is fix the um
35:02 - the issue by the way is the fact that
35:05 - there's not enough white space
35:07 - separating the projects and contact
35:09 - section the little buttons the call to
35:11 - actions from the other two elements up
35:14 - here so what we want to do is we want to
35:17 - take these the button container
35:19 - will want to do a margin top he only has
35:21 - 20 pixels so we want to go
35:24 - maybe
35:28 - i'm just going to use m units by the way
35:30 - oops
35:31 - like five maybe seven m units
35:35 - yeah we'll just do six
35:37 - and now
35:38 - things can breathe a lot easier they're
35:40 - not so cluttered
35:42 - additionally
35:43 - i i would use something like flexbox or
35:47 - the grid the css grid to try to get this
35:50 - pushed down
35:52 - uh and center it vertically within this
35:54 - container because it's just up high and
35:56 - then there's hardly anything happening
35:57 - down here
35:58 - so again you know i wouldn't use margin
36:01 - for this we'd use uh place content
36:04 - center or something like that but
36:05 - nonetheless margin top you know we want
36:07 - to push this thing down
36:10 - i
36:12 - not 20 m units
36:14 - more like uh am units or so
36:17 - and now
36:18 - just take a look at this and i'm going
36:20 - to refresh it so you can see the
36:22 - original and just
36:24 - pay attention to how this
36:26 - just feel looks and feels so much better
36:28 - so if i refresh
36:31 - look how it's all just kind of
36:32 - you know it's kind of cluttered up there
36:34 - it's
36:35 - put at the up at the top so these are
36:37 - the things
36:39 - when it comes to ui design fundamentals
36:41 - and understanding them and understanding
36:43 - how to apply them that really make or
36:46 - break a design i'm not saying that this
36:48 - thing is completely broken there's a lot
36:49 - of good things happening here but it can
36:51 - really complete a design so looking at
36:54 - this here
36:55 - i
36:56 - it was an issue of
37:00 - alignment so this whole blip right here
37:02 - was it's just it's aligned up to the top
37:04 - too much too high because it's leaving
37:06 - an uneven amount of uh white space down
37:09 - here and also white space between these
37:12 - elements right here um coming down
37:16 - all right my backpack i like being
37:17 - unique uh
37:19 - in your copy so that's good
37:21 - um
37:23 - all right
37:24 - one thing i also don't like uh which
37:26 - he's this person's not doing here at all
37:29 - i is a lot of portfolios that i've seen
37:32 - do this thing where they show progress
37:34 - bars
37:35 - for their skills
37:38 - don't do that because you you don't
37:40 - really want
37:41 - you you might be ha you might
37:43 - maybe you're trying to become hired at
37:44 - some you know maybe google or whatever
37:47 - and they really need somebody who's
37:49 - proficient in javascript but you're
37:51 - putting that you're 10 percent
37:53 - proficient in javascript i wouldn't lay
37:55 - out my cards like that
37:57 - because you're letting people know what
37:58 - your absolute weak weaknesses are if
38:00 - you're if you're a front-end developer
38:03 - and i
38:05 - you know
38:06 - maybe you're
38:08 - not that great at react maybe just don't
38:11 - put react anyhow all right so there's
38:13 - different ways to do this i like okay if
38:15 - you're gonna do this that's fine
38:18 - i think
38:19 - the layout gets broken a little bit when
38:21 - you shift it to a second line right here
38:24 - so the ui design kind of suffers from
38:26 - that if you're going to have this many
38:28 - you can probably use a carousel if you
38:30 - want or just utilize uh
38:34 - or structure this in a different manner
38:36 - to where it's not uneven
38:37 - where you just have two on their own
38:39 - down here
38:40 - all right so now we have some cards
38:42 - right here by the way okay and here's
38:43 - something that we haven't faced yet
38:45 - borders
38:46 - most of the time you don't want to use
38:48 - borders borders were something
38:50 - that were really popular you know back
38:53 - when i got started in the late 90s and
38:55 - the 2000s into the 2010s just about
38:58 - before web 2.0 came along but the
39:00 - borders
39:02 - you don't you completely do not need
39:04 - this border right here underneath
39:05 - projects
39:07 - i would take that sucker
39:10 - out
39:11 - it's a border bottom so i'm going to
39:13 - hide that there you go we've already now
39:15 - we created
39:17 - a pretty solid change here just by
39:19 - getting rid of an unnecessary border
39:21 - because it's completely unnecessary in
39:23 - this context you don't need a border
39:24 - here
39:25 - i you have cards we have the label we
39:28 - know
39:28 - the cards are in relation to this label
39:31 - so you definitely want to get rid of
39:33 - your borders
39:34 - another thing i would change here
39:36 - whenever you have two buttons
39:38 - i'm not usually a big fan especially in
39:40 - this context like on a card of having
39:43 - them styled exactly the same because
39:45 - then it just becomes overwhelming you
39:47 - have all these buttons one should be
39:49 - secondary and not emphasized as much so
39:53 - maybe one is just the same color as this
39:55 - background right here with the view on
39:57 - npm being maybe white or something and
40:00 - you can make it maybe have a border as
40:02 - well i along this button and that way
40:05 - one is a little bit more emphasized over
40:07 - the other
40:08 - coming down here
40:11 - this about me section is quit pretty
40:13 - weak because all it is is just a
40:16 - a paragraph underneath it and it spans
40:19 - the entire width practically of the
40:21 - design and reading that
40:23 - becomes a little bit of a headache so
40:26 - you could put a picture of yourself like
40:27 - in a two-column layout and then situate
40:30 - this stuff to the right but there's a
40:32 - lot of ways you could approach it but i
40:33 - wouldn't just do this um in and of
40:35 - itself
40:37 - one thing that's also throwing me off
40:39 - the about me is a little bit like gray
40:41 - but the main content is white i would
40:44 - reverse that
40:47 - all right so i like this section the
40:49 - most i'm not sure if you've used some
40:51 - sort of like um
40:53 - what do you call a library or some type
40:55 - of you know component that was
40:57 - pre-designed but i do like this the most
41:01 - all right so right here last thing the
41:03 - form probably i i would take the
41:06 - especially on this resolution
41:08 - right here it makes sense to keep it
41:10 - like that but when you have it all the
41:12 - way out here these are really long form
41:14 - fields take it and create at least two
41:16 - columns take the enter your name your
41:19 - email can go right next to there and
41:20 - that way you're saving space vertically
41:22 - as well
41:23 - but at least you are using the labels
41:25 - which is great
41:27 - all right so what do you think this
41:27 - person should get for a rating one being
41:29 - the worst and 10 being the very best
41:32 - well the timeline is self-made well
41:34 - that's very uh that's impressive i like
41:36 - this timeline a lot that's this right
41:38 - here is the strongest part of this ui
41:39 - design
41:48 - all right get your answers in
41:50 - i will give mine
41:52 - very shortly
42:00 - i'm just looking at it and just trying
42:02 - to think you know what do i think this
42:04 - person should get
42:05 - there's a lot of things happening right
42:07 - here and the contrast is is solved solid
42:10 - it's pretty simple which isn't bad
42:13 - that's not a bad
42:14 - thing i'm just going to give this one a
42:21 - 6.5 i believe yeah right around there
42:26 - now some people have asked me have i
42:27 - ever given a 10
42:29 - no i have not there's always some tiny
42:32 - little issue that i can uh i can
42:34 - pinpoint because trust me i've done like
42:36 - 50 60 70 80 of these shows i'm not even
42:39 - sure how many
42:40 - all right so let's check out who is next
42:43 - i
42:45 - all right
42:52 - all right here's another portfolio this
42:54 - is from megan
43:01 - all right
43:02 - so if i refresh this we'll see if
43:04 - there's any animation no there's not
43:06 - which i that that doesn't mean like
43:08 - there should be i just
43:09 - like to show if there is
43:11 - all right so
43:14 - there is a
43:16 - that one issue that i addressed before
43:17 - which is you're not addressing what what
43:19 - this site is exactly about i know it's
43:21 - about you but what is it that you do we
43:23 - need to be a little bit more specific
43:25 - about that i like that you're being you
43:27 - know a little bit unique especially with
43:29 - the topography i like that part
43:31 - um but i do think the navigation over
43:33 - here can have it needs a little bit of
43:36 - work just having these buttons kind of
43:38 - like really separated out and each one
43:40 - of them being their own button
43:42 - encased in this design like that it
43:44 - feels just a little bit i guess you
43:45 - could say it's designed in a manner
43:47 - that's kind of uh amateur i guess you
43:48 - could say or
43:50 - yeah just amateur i would say
43:52 - what i would do in this context if i
43:54 - were you and trust me this is one this
43:56 - is a tip i haven't talked about this
43:57 - here yet
43:59 - gaining inspiration from other designers
44:02 - so i'm going to show you a couple sites
44:06 - dribble.com
44:07 - so most of you may know of dribble.com
44:10 - but it features some of the best uh dui
44:13 - designers so if we go to the popular
44:15 - section here you'll gain a lot of ideas
44:18 - about different ui elements uh if you
44:21 - don't see one maybe you're trying to
44:22 - work on a vertical nav bar or sidebar
44:25 - like megan has right here
44:27 - well i vertical
44:30 - navigation like if i type in vertical
44:32 - navigation
44:33 - i'm probably going to see a lot of
44:35 - different ideas for the designs of
44:38 - vertical navigations and if something
44:40 - really sticks out well to you i'm not
44:42 - saying copy it pixel for pixel but gain
44:46 - inspiration from it
44:48 - when you're a brand new designer
44:50 - and you try to come up with designs from
44:53 - scratch
44:55 - that's a very that's a that's a tough
44:58 - ask i mean you're putting a lot on
44:59 - yourself if you're you're not an
45:01 - experienced designer i'm not saying
45:04 - don't don't screw my words up here i'm
45:06 - not saying go out there and copy things
45:08 - pixel for pixel but i'm saying you need
45:10 - to expose yourself
45:12 - to
45:13 - other designs and other great designs in
45:16 - that way you can start
45:18 - to develop an eye even if it's just
45:21 - through observation
45:23 - so that you can start to apply some of
45:25 - these to your own designs and in fact i
45:27 - would say like here here's here's a real
45:30 - nice
45:31 - sidebars right here
45:32 - these are really nice uh the way that
45:34 - they're done
45:35 - and really pay attention to why they're
45:38 - doing the certain things they're doing
45:39 - notice hers has these little icons right
45:42 - here i'm gonna i'm gonna
45:43 - zoom up so we can see this
45:46 - these have nice icons as well but each
45:49 - one of these being separated out and
45:51 - being in their own buttons and being
45:53 - real far apart from each other kind of
45:55 - just throws off the flow of this this ui
45:57 - design i noticed how like a lot of these
46:00 - examples you know what you want to do is
46:02 - look at similarities between these
46:04 - examples why do they look good why are
46:07 - they so effective well i could tell you
46:09 - one reason
46:10 - is they're they're pretty close together
46:13 - and they're not all in there in they're
46:15 - not all encased in their own individual
46:17 - buttons i and and so that makes it
46:20 - simpler to use um and they also provide
46:23 - a state maybe you hover over them
46:25 - they're going to have their own little
46:26 - design where the background changes in a
46:28 - very subtle manner
46:30 - and maybe another manner where it's
46:31 - actually selected maybe that one sticks
46:34 - out a little bit more but for this these
46:36 - are all
46:37 - i
46:38 - really just encased in their own little
46:41 - world because they're they're separated
46:43 - out far apart and they're also their own
46:45 - uh project uh or the button rather uh so
46:48 - that that's my review here you would
46:49 - definitely want to change this up um and
46:52 - also
46:53 - the other thing that i mentioned let us
46:55 - know more specifically about what you're
46:57 - doing what this website is for rather
46:59 - than just being about you
47:01 - all right so what do you guys think this
47:03 - person should get for a rating one being
47:04 - the worst and 10 being the best
47:07 - where am i from i am from the united
47:09 - states i live in ohio
47:19 - one being the worst 10 being the best
47:21 - i'll let you guys know what
47:23 - i have that problem i say guys all the
47:25 - time i'll let you people know
47:28 - i i'll let you people know what i think
47:30 - here in a few seconds
47:46 - i'm going to give this one
47:48 - for what it is and again i didn't i
47:51 - don't have enough time to go through
47:52 - everybody's like every page so i
47:54 - apologize for that for what i see here
47:56 - i'm going to give this one a
48:06 - a
48:07 - 3.3 or so i think
48:11 - all right
48:13 - all right so
48:14 - next up
48:16 - who is next all right i have one picked
48:19 - out here this is from user
48:23 - colb
48:24 - colby i think
48:28 - all right so this is a behance.net
48:31 - gallery submission so it's it's nothing
48:33 - that's realized yet it looks like it's a
48:35 - it's a messenger redesigned for the
48:37 - iphone so you know as a matter of trying
48:40 - to practice and get better you can do
48:41 - redesigns and and see that if you you
48:44 - can challenge yourself to try to come up
48:45 - with something better in terms of the ui
48:47 - or the ux experience of popular apps
48:51 - so looking at this
48:52 - real quickly
48:54 - i wish you could have like a little bit
48:55 - higher resolution photos to look at this
48:58 - looks really solid though in my opinion
49:01 - good visual hierarchy
49:03 - the type looks good and well separated
49:05 - between each other
49:08 - yeah this looks pretty solid in my
49:09 - opinion oops did i just click off of
49:11 - that oh there we go
49:13 - um this one
49:16 - is a little strange to me because the
49:18 - chat screen we're using two different
49:20 - color schemes so this one's blue
49:22 - but this one changed to uh pink
49:26 - so that's a little bit confusing to me
49:28 - um i'm not sure if that's maybe
49:31 - demonstrating like user color
49:33 - preferences or not but if not you don't
49:35 - want to do that you want to you want to
49:37 - be consistent in your application of
49:39 - your ui design principles and those
49:41 - things being you want to be you want to
49:43 - consistently apply
49:44 - uh your your usage of colors
49:47 - so you want to have a color theme that
49:48 - you use across the whole site and you
49:50 - also want to
49:51 - i apply the same topography the same
49:54 - type of uh margins and padding white
49:57 - space on and all that stuff the scale
49:59 - all that all that good stuff
50:01 - but outside of that
50:03 - this looks pretty pretty solid for what
50:05 - it is
50:06 - i think because there's not enough
50:07 - screens and because it's not highlighted
50:09 - enough resolution we won't bother doing
50:11 - a rating here but it is good i it's
50:14 - probably one of the highest
50:16 - rated so far just by looking at this
50:18 - right here
50:20 - all right um
50:22 - let's go ahead and check out
50:24 - another one
50:29 - we'll do
50:31 - another portfolio i think after this
50:33 - we'll try not to stick to
50:35 - portfolio so much
50:36 - uh let's refresh it to see if there's
50:38 - any animations
50:41 - wait what was that
50:44 - so if you notice if i refresh this
50:46 - there's like text over these little
50:48 - cards and it just it goes away really
50:51 - fast
50:53 - why are you doing that
50:54 - that's strange to me
50:56 - yeah so i want to do that because that
50:57 - serves no purpose there's no way a
50:58 - person's going to be able to read all
51:00 - them and then it just hides so it leaves
51:02 - me angered
51:04 - when you do that
51:05 - now this is cool i do like that that is
51:08 - a cool way
51:09 - we can hover over it and we have a nice
51:11 - uh
51:12 - sequence based animation
51:14 - so that that this works pretty well i
51:17 - would probably increase the padding
51:19 - which will help the white space inside
51:21 - of the container
51:22 - because these are out a little bit too
51:24 - close to the edges
51:26 - so i would increase the padding there
51:31 - that's pretty solid i welcome my
51:33 - portfolio i specialize in ui ux design
51:35 - in front of development
51:36 - so what this person's doing is this
51:38 - they're they're taking the they're
51:40 - taking the visitor
51:41 - straight into probably what they want to
51:43 - see the most the work
51:45 - but i would still probably also have
51:47 - something down here in this big empty
51:50 - open space i that
51:52 - says do you like what you see maybe you
51:54 - can hire me with a button a strong call
51:57 - to action outside of just having their
51:59 - work here so if i click about
52:03 - all right
52:04 - so i like that you did something unique
52:06 - up here instead of just having a
52:08 - paragraph about you uh so that that
52:10 - works pretty well right here
52:12 - um it's a little bit
52:15 - the type is a little bit strange to me
52:16 - because
52:17 - we have a label up here let me tell you
52:19 - a bit about me
52:21 - um i
52:23 - honestly i think what i would do
52:26 - that looks nice see right here when it's
52:28 - on three lines it's nice and centered
52:30 - but when it's not it's kind of it's it's
52:33 - pushed up a little bit so the alignment
52:35 - is off so
52:37 - it probably sounds like i'm really
52:38 - nitpicky but these things matter uh they
52:40 - matter at every re at every viewport
52:44 - trying to get your site up look at this
52:46 - so these are things like if we don't
52:48 - test them well enough
52:49 - and we don't take this browser and drag
52:51 - them in and also try to test them on
52:53 - real devices that we can see big issues
52:55 - somebody might be on on an ipad
52:58 - and they're looking at this and you're
52:59 - like what
53:00 - i can't read the bottom of this or why
53:02 - is this cut off if this person makes a
53:04 - website for me
53:06 - are they going to do this to my site
53:09 - and then this could literally something
53:10 - like this could literally be the
53:12 - difference between getting a two
53:14 - thousand dollar project and then just
53:16 - not getting chosen at all so i would i
53:19 - definitely make sure you address these
53:21 - issues uh as much as possible to make
53:24 - sure nothing bad like that is happening
53:28 - all right so do you think this person
53:29 - should get for a rating one being the
53:31 - worst and 10 being the best
53:52 - let me know i'm going to wait for your
53:54 - answers to come in i'm not seeing them
53:55 - just yet i think there's a delay
53:57 - happening
54:15 - i'm going to give this one
54:18 - a
54:19 - flat out oh and by the way another thing
54:21 - you know this whole blip here should be
54:23 - vertically centered
54:24 - so that way there's not a big amount of
54:26 - white space just sitting there for this
54:28 - one i'm going to give this a rating
54:31 - of
54:34 - yeah i'm going to give this a
54:38 - flat out
54:39 - just a six
54:41 - and it seems like a lot of you are
54:42 - agreeing with me
54:44 - on that
54:45 - based on upon a quick glance at least
54:48 - all right so we have another one here
54:50 - this one is for a sas project not the
54:53 - css sas but software as a service
54:57 - so
54:58 - this is from
54:59 - user
55:01 - uh
55:02 - daniel
55:03 - all right so let's close this out
55:06 - by the way we've been running for
55:11 - 54 minutes so we'll probably be over
55:14 - here in about 20 minutes or so
55:16 - i will keep on doing this um maybe even
55:18 - longer i'm not sure we'll see how this
55:20 - goes
55:21 - all right so this is a figma prototype
55:24 - so it's not realized in the browser yet
55:26 - with your html and css so understand
55:28 - that
55:29 - and this let's see here so i'm not
55:32 - really sure what this is about
55:33 - the user didn't tell me or i didn't at
55:35 - least read it
55:37 - so unique web
55:39 - home about us pricing contact dashboard
55:42 - save time with unique web the all-in-one
55:44 - management solution for your minecraft
55:46 - server okay
55:48 - so
55:50 - based on that verbiage now that we know
55:52 - it's a management solution for minecraft
55:58 - why
55:59 - is there no visual indicator
56:03 - that this is about minecraft
56:05 - so we're using these
56:07 - these generic sort of uh illustrations
56:10 - probably got
56:11 - from some site somewhere
56:13 - but they don't say anything about
56:15 - minecraft this is where
56:18 - creating or
56:20 - either yourself but if you're not an
56:22 - illustrator and most people aren't
56:23 - illustrators maybe hiring somebody to
56:26 - come up with a really good illustration
56:28 - for this hero section
56:30 - that
56:32 - indic that indicates that this is about
56:34 - minecraft management so it's about
56:37 - thinking uniquely
56:39 - in order to create a nice relevant
56:40 - graphic here because i had to read the
56:43 - sub headline
56:44 - in order to understand what this is
56:46 - about whereas if i had a visual
56:48 - indicator through either a
56:51 - screenshot or an illustration like this
56:54 - i would have known a little bit quicker
56:56 - that they this is something about
56:57 - minecraft right
57:01 - the login button is too big so scale is
57:03 - one of those things to understand about
57:05 - ui design fundamentals that will help
57:07 - your designs the login button is too big
57:09 - in relation to the size of all the other
57:11 - elements so i would i would i would
57:13 - scale that back
57:15 - also does it make sense
57:18 - from an information architecture
57:19 - standpoint to have a login button be
57:21 - your primary call to action
57:24 - wouldn't it perhaps be
57:26 - maybe something maybe you have a free
57:28 - trial and you have a get started button
57:30 - that would probably perform a lot better
57:32 - people who are already members they're
57:35 - not going to be going back to your
57:36 - website and like clicking this they
57:38 - don't need to click this they'll usually
57:39 - look up and click on a dashboard or a
57:42 - login link
57:44 - outside of that
57:46 - the i would change the card background
57:49 - because it looks like it's in a slightly
57:50 - different hue than this background color
57:53 - so it's a little strange what i like to
57:55 - do
57:56 - um is i like to take
57:59 - this the background color that is
58:00 - sitting on you know what let me do this
58:02 - real quick
58:03 - i'll open up adobe xd
58:06 - and i'll show you what i mean because
58:07 - it's kind of hard to describe what i'm
58:09 - talking about
58:11 - um so this is going to help us just a
58:12 - little bit more so let's say we get this
58:15 - a similar background color so i'll just
58:17 - go here
58:19 - and this looks like it's it's somewhere
58:21 - in the blue desaturated right around
58:23 - there okay
58:24 - so
58:25 - if you're gonna have cards like that
58:28 - sorry i hid the chat let me move this
58:30 - over if you're gonna have cards like
58:32 - that
58:34 - a great way to give them separation
58:38 - is to do this so here's our card
58:42 - maybe we have slightly rounded corners
58:46 - what i'll do is take the background
58:48 - color so now it becomes the same
58:50 - background and becomes visible and then
58:52 - just take this color picker
58:54 - and make it maybe slightly darker
58:57 - i would not change this hue because look
59:00 - how ugly
59:01 - that looks
59:03 - we start pushing up here that's kind of
59:05 - what this person was doing it just
59:07 - doesn't look good
59:08 - so what you would do instead is get that
59:11 - same background color and then just
59:13 - either make it lighter
59:15 - i'm just pushing it up very just very
59:17 - barely like a couple pixels or you can
59:20 - make it darker
59:22 - like right there
59:25 - and so that looks a lot better
59:28 - than what you had before right here so
59:32 - notice how they're in different hues it
59:33 - just doesn't make sense it doesn't look
59:35 - as good
59:37 - outside of that
59:41 - i would probably increase the line
59:43 - height
59:44 - from your headlines right here
59:48 - and then when it comes to price
59:50 - comparison tables this is another great
59:52 - tip you can go to dribble type in price
59:54 - comparison or prices to try to get ideas
59:57 - but you usually want to emphasize one or
59:59 - the other and again you do that through
60:02 - ui design um
60:04 - and
60:04 - also
60:05 - change your verbage sign up sign up sign
60:07 - up so that these are all styled the same
60:09 - you really want to emphasize one or the
60:11 - other all right so what do you guys
60:12 - think this person should get for a
60:14 - rating one being the worst and 10 being
60:16 - the absolute best
60:37 - i'll wait for your answers to come in
60:42 - for me
60:44 - i think i know what i'm going to get but
60:45 - this one
60:48 - probably
60:58 - yeah again i i hate to give like all
61:00 - almost all the same ratings but this
61:02 - again is probably somewhere around
61:07 - like a 6.2 or so
61:10 - there are some things that are happening
61:12 - well here so i mean there's a lot of
61:14 - good things but
61:16 - those things are really taking away
61:18 - from the overall score
61:21 - all right i
61:23 - we're gonna check out just a few more
61:29 - somebody said attend
61:31 - you must have really loved that all
61:32 - right
61:35 - or it was the actual user
61:38 - all right well it's great to be
61:39 - confident yourself right
61:42 - all right so
61:44 - let's go ahead and check this one out so
61:46 - we're going to write we're going to
61:47 - refresh this all right so there's no
61:49 - animation
61:51 - first thing
61:52 - too much white space
61:54 - up here in this uh the nav bar i'm not
61:57 - sure if that was intentional or maybe
61:59 - it's it's an issue with the html css but
62:01 - you want to get that
62:02 - right underneath where you know these
62:04 - end
62:05 - second
62:06 - tours and travel
62:08 - amazing place on earth
62:10 - might want to rethink that verbiage
62:12 - there a little bit
62:13 - um but the biggest issue
62:16 - is this button
62:17 - this i can see there's a little bit of a
62:19 - gradient in it
62:21 - going from dark purple to lighter purple
62:24 - in the middle
62:25 - with
62:26 - explore being something that you can
62:28 - barely even read
62:30 - what i would do
62:32 - if i can change this easily sometimes
62:34 - depending on what people are doing it's
62:36 - hard for me to change stuff but this
62:37 - shouldn't be that difficult
62:38 - the background we need to change to
62:41 - white
62:43 - we'll make the font weight
62:45 - bold
62:47 - uh font size
62:51 - maybe not that large
62:53 - like that
62:54 - at this resolution this
62:56 - this right here
62:58 - should be
63:00 - like four rem units there we go that's
63:03 - looking better
63:04 - and then this font size should be like
63:06 - 0.7 rem
63:09 - oh wait that was the margin i changed
63:10 - well you get the point uh one point or
63:13 - maybe like two ram units there we go
63:16 - this looks a lot better
63:18 - because you're utilizing the space more
63:20 - effectively because we're on this larger
63:22 - viewport
63:23 - and it's not so small and we've also
63:26 - made this
63:27 - call to action stick out a lot more so
63:29 - contrast is another one of those ui
63:31 - design fundamentals that really helps a
63:33 - design come together
63:35 - if i refresh you'll see the original
63:39 - and you can see just
63:40 - when those few things are off it doesn't
63:43 - look as good so you want to have good
63:45 - contrast especially when you're using a
63:47 - photograph watermark based background
63:49 - for your hero section
63:51 - all right so that's a little bit uh
63:53 - interesting one problem though
63:56 - i can see the pixelation here i on this
63:59 - so it looks a little bit cheap because i
64:01 - can see along these bezier curves
64:04 - there's pixelation occurring so you
64:06 - don't want that you can actually achieve
64:08 - this
64:09 - uh if you set if you structured your
64:10 - html a little bit differently and use
64:12 - css
64:14 - to create
64:15 - like an svg overlap and that way there
64:18 - will never be any pixelation
64:21 - looking at these cards
64:23 - this is one thing i haven't seen yet um
64:25 - with these reviews
64:27 - is
64:28 - using the drop shadow drop shadows and
64:31 - i've done videos on drop shadows you can
64:33 - do a search on my youtube channel
64:35 - they're not always bad
64:37 - but i see especially
64:39 - you know relatively new ui designers
64:41 - they get it wrong because they they
64:43 - really emphasize the drop shadows too
64:45 - much so that's the case here you want if
64:48 - you're going to use a drop shadow like
64:49 - this a big soft one on your cards
64:52 - make it very almost unrecognizable you
64:55 - don't want them to stick out too much
64:58 - because it always makes it look cheap or
65:00 - amateur or outdated in terms of designs
65:02 - because this is something us designers
65:05 - back you know in the early 2000s we used
65:07 - to do a lot of we thought drop shadows
65:09 - were really cool all the time
65:10 - but that's not so much the case anymore
65:13 - and that's for there's a good reason for
65:15 - that and that's because people don't
65:16 - really care about your shadows they care
65:18 - about the content so you want them to be
65:20 - afterthought as much as possible
65:23 - also i could see
65:25 - these these card backgrounds are
65:27 - actually transparent so that's why we
65:29 - can see this element in the background
65:31 - which by the way is not svg this element
65:33 - right here should completely be an svg
65:35 - graphic not a png or anything that's
65:38 - raster based because i can see
65:40 - all the pixelation occurring
65:44 - again issue with a
65:46 - contrast right here when we have a dark
65:48 - purple and then we're using black text
65:50 - no no no no these should be white so
65:54 - people can actually read them also an
65:56 - issue with alignment we see we have a
65:58 - column structured right here which is
66:01 - defined by the first element being this
66:02 - label but then you're pushing it over
66:04 - just a little bit and it throws off the
66:06 - flow of the design
66:09 - same thing right here
66:11 - this is unnecessary to have this indent
66:13 - indentation or this white space so
66:16 - white space isn't always a good thing
66:17 - you have to know how to apply it
66:19 - correctly
66:20 - a border here unnecessary don't want
66:22 - that creates too much clutter
66:27 - uneven alignment right here and this
66:30 - button button should be white the tag
66:32 - the the actual text
66:34 - so yeah there's a lot of small issues
66:36 - here
66:38 - and it's interesting i could probably
66:40 - take this design
66:42 - and make it go from a rating of about
66:44 - five
66:45 - probably to like eight in the matter of
66:48 - 30 minutes if i if i had enough time to
66:50 - work with it and everything and that's
66:52 - what you can do once you develop that
66:54 - eye and understand the ui design
66:56 - fundamentals
66:57 - so what do you guys think this person
66:59 - should get for writing one being the
67:00 - worst and 10 being the best
67:06 - we are going to do one more
67:08 - because my voice is becoming extremely
67:11 - scratchy
67:12 - we will do one more um and then we will
67:14 - conclude
67:16 - the show
67:20 - one being the worst ten being the best
67:31 - for me i'm going to go ahead and give
67:33 - this a rating
67:37 - let's think here um
67:44 - 5.6
67:46 - yeah something like that i think that's
67:49 - pretty fair
67:52 - all right
67:54 - i'm gonna check out one more
67:56 - i like to screen the submissions on my
67:58 - other monitor just in case somebody
68:00 - decides to troll me
68:03 - uh
68:04 - fortunately not many people have ever
68:06 - done that
68:07 - all right
68:09 - all right here's the last one
68:12 - cream digital all right
68:17 - all right so
68:19 - how about we do something different for
68:20 - this very last one
68:23 - what do you think is wrong
68:25 - about this section the most let me know
68:27 - in the chat
68:31 - like what does this suffer from the most
68:36 - and i'm talking about ui design
68:37 - fundamentals what like what
68:40 - what is the one thing that could be
68:41 - corrected to really make this design
68:43 - better
68:45 - i'm not asking for a rating
68:48 - seriously
68:49 - people just spamming
68:51 - a rating and i'm not even asking them
68:59 - sharma said light theme
69:01 - alignment
69:03 - bland not enough space
69:05 - alignment
69:06 - font size and
69:08 - white space
69:10 - too much white space
69:12 - it's a boring
69:17 - hierarchy
69:21 - all right so
69:22 - i would agree with the people who said
69:25 - white space of course there's a i mean
69:27 - not white space i'm sorry alignment
69:29 - the one thing that is immediately thrown
69:32 - off is
69:33 - the we have a column that started right
69:35 - here
69:36 - uh
69:37 - based on the first element we see which
69:39 - is the logo um
69:41 - but offset to the left
69:44 - over here is
69:46 - their you know their their headline and
69:48 - sub headline and call to action
69:50 - this should be
69:51 - either moved in to match up with this
69:54 - logo or this
69:56 - up here should be moved out and this
69:59 - suitably being moved out as well another
70:02 - issue somebody said font size i agree
70:04 - it's a little bit too small in this sub
70:07 - headline right here this is pretty good
70:09 - but this should be probably beefed up a
70:11 - little bit more in terms of font size
70:13 - same thing with the get started caption
70:15 - for the call to action also
70:17 - i would make
70:18 - instead of being it being outlined i
70:21 - would make this filled in
70:23 - uh to be something that's
70:26 - well this is interesting why is the okay
70:29 - where's the background background color
70:30 - there we go the background should be you
70:32 - know
70:34 - something more like that and then the
70:35 - color should be white
70:37 - and then
70:38 - font way could be bold
70:42 - um
70:43 - is there a stroke on that it kind of
70:44 - looks like there's a stroke either way
70:46 - that way it stands out so much it stands
70:49 - out a lot more also i probably move it
70:51 - down
70:52 - uh because this is all a little bit
70:53 - cluttered in its own section and there's
70:55 - a lot of white space another thing
70:56 - people said
70:57 - is the white space too much white space
70:59 - so i would fix those issues
71:02 - the learn more button
71:03 - unusually too big
71:05 - i would scale that down
71:09 - i like the the
71:10 - illustration
71:11 - the illustration here is pretty solid i
71:13 - like this one a lot
71:14 - this one's a little bit on the generic
71:17 - side
71:21 - cards here with a ton of white space too
71:23 - much white space at the bottom as
71:25 - opposed to the top so when we're adding
71:27 - white space we want to try to make it
71:28 - especially in the card format you want
71:30 - to make it uniform top bottom right left
71:32 - same white space
71:34 - so probably a little bit too much white
71:36 - space here
71:37 - um
71:38 - coming down
71:41 - all right uh
71:43 - this section is not too bad here
71:49 - we have a
71:51 - small call to action looks really small
71:54 - again when people scroll down you want
71:56 - to give them
71:57 - access to
71:59 - you know wherever it is you're trying to
72:00 - direct them to every page should have a
72:02 - purpose
72:03 - the get cream button down here seems
72:04 - like an afterthought
72:06 - style it like this but make it white so
72:08 - it really has a good contrast down here
72:10 - and it'll stand out much more so let's
72:12 - do a final rating one being the worst 10
72:14 - being the best let me know what you
72:16 - think and we'll see if we agree and then
72:18 - we will conclude
72:35 - what am i going to give this one let me
72:37 - think here
72:40 - things going right about it the
72:41 - illustrations are pretty nice for the
72:42 - most part good usage of color i like the
72:45 - color scheme for the most part i think a
72:47 - little bit heavy on some of the the
72:49 - linear gradients
72:51 - i like the logo a lot
72:55 - topography is pretty good
73:01 - yeah so i'm going to give this one a
73:03 - flat out
73:06 - let me see here
73:09 - i'm going to give it like a 7 or like a
73:12 - 6.9 or so
73:14 - um
73:15 - and i'll probably be one of our kind of
73:17 - a better ones
73:18 - but i still didn't see anything that
73:20 - really knocked it out of the park in my
73:21 - opinion today but nonetheless thank you
73:23 - all for you know those of you who
73:25 - submitted now i know hundreds of you
73:27 - submitted designs and i was only able to
73:29 - get through like 10 or 15. uh but
73:32 - there's good news first of all i'm going
73:34 - to be doing this again
73:35 - i on free code camp's channel here
73:39 - next wednesday at the same time and also
73:41 - the wednesday after that so this is a
73:43 - three stream session this is the first
73:45 - of three so you guys you can all come

73:49 - a new hashtag i'm not sure about that
73:52 - for you to submit but i'll talk with uh
73:55 - the people at free code camp about that
73:57 - and you'll have all the details they
73:59 - usually announce the uh the live stream
74:02 - and they they they set it there that
74:04 - their youtube channel so you'll see the
74:05 - details um and also
74:08 - i also i do this show on my own youtube

74:39 - it's going to be the most comprehensive
74:41 - course i that you can imagine there's
74:44 - going to be video courses there's going
74:45 - to be interactive ui design challenges
74:48 - there's going to be live ui ux workshops
74:50 - i'm really excited for it uh and so it's
74:52 - going to be releasing in several months
74:54 - time i'm not exactly sure when we're
