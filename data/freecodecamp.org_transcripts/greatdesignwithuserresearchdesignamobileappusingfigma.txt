00:00 - In this course you will improve your user 
interface and user experience design skills  
00:05 - by building a mobile app. Instructor, Joseph 
Brendan is a great designer and great teacher.  
00:11 - Hey, guys, my name is Joseph, Brandon. And in 
this course, I am going to show you how to design  
00:17 - a mobile app from scratch. Now, this mobile 
app will be a stock investing mobile app  
00:25 - that users can use to invest in the stocks of 
companies that they would like to invest in.  
00:33 - So here is a demonstration of the app that we 
are going to design. Now over here, we have  
00:40 - the splash screen of the app, which is what's 
going to show up when you launch the app. Now,  
00:47 - let's go to the next page here. Now, this is 
the page where the user will have to select  
00:53 - their next action, which is either to log in as 
an existing user or to get started as a new user.  
01:00 - So I'll go ahead and click on get started, just 
like a new user would do. And here on this page,  
01:08 - the new user will be required to sign up to this 
application with an email address, a phone number  
01:15 - and a password. Now, when the new user doors that 
the new user will be taken to this page, where  
01:22 - the new user will have to enter a verification 
code that's been sent to the phone number of that  
01:30 - new user. Now, when the phone number of the new 
user is verified, it means that the new user is  
01:38 - now a registered user on this application, and the 
next thing the user is going to do is to click on  
01:44 - the Proceed button here. And when the user does 
that, the user will be taken to the homepage of  
01:51 - the application, which is this page here. And here 
on the homepage of this application. Over here,  
01:58 - the account balance of the user will be displayed 
here. Also, the user will have a button here  
02:05 - that can be used to fund the account on 
this application. And right over here,  
02:12 - the user will have a list of recent transactions 
that they have carried out on this application.  
02:20 - Now coming down here, the user will see a banner 
here that they can click on to get a referral link  
02:28 - that can be used to invite friends to have an 
account on this app. Now, at the bottom here,  
02:35 - we have the navigation section of this app. 
Currently, we are on the homepage of the app.  
02:42 - Now let's navigate to the InVEST page, which is 
the page where the user will have the features  
02:48 - that they can use to invest in stocks. So I'd come 
here, and I'll click on invest. When I do that,  
02:57 - I'll be taken to the InVEST page, which 
is this. And over here on the InVEST page,  
03:03 - you can see that we have a display 
of cash and assets owned by the user.  
03:10 - And right after that, over here, we have a 
list of top stocks that the user can invest in.  
03:18 - And also, we have the investment portfolio of 
that user over here, which is a list of all the  
03:25 - investments that the user had made on this app. 
Now let's say the user is trying to invest in one  
03:33 - of the stocks listed here, let's say this one, 
yeah. Now, if the user clicks on it, the user  
03:39 - will be taken to the details page of that stock 
that they clicked on. And on this details page,  
03:47 - we are going to have information about the 
stock and the company that owns the stock.  
03:54 - Now if the user likes what they see here, the user 
will go ahead to click on the InVEST button here.  
04:02 - And when the user clicks on that button, the user 
will be required to enter the amount that they  
04:09 - wish to invest in that stocks with. Now when the 
user enters the amount and the user clicks on the  
04:17 - Proceed button here, the user will see a summary 
of the investment that they are about to make. And  
04:24 - when the user is okay with what they see here in 
the summary. The user will be required to enter  
04:31 - their secrets pin here, and then click on the 
InVEST button here. And when the user does that,  
04:38 - it means that the investment has been successful. 
So this app that I just demonstrated here is  
04:46 - what we are going to design in this course from 
scratch. Now before we start designing this app,  
04:53 - I would love to break down the stages of our 
workflow for this project, so that you can  
04:59 - understand In the execution process of designing 
products that are actual business solutions.  
05:06 - So here are the stages of our workflow. First 
things first, the stakeholders of this project,  
05:13 - which is the owner of the project, 
or the company we are working for,  
05:18 - will present us with a problem that they would 
want us to design for. Now, when they present  
05:25 - these problems on us, they are also going to tell 
us about the users, which are the people facing  
05:32 - the problem that they want us to design for. 
Now, after that, the stakeholders will state  
05:40 - their expected goals for the project. Now after 
the stakeholders presents a problem and states,  
05:47 - their expected goals to us, the next 
stage of our workflow will be for us,  
05:53 - the UX designers to empathize with the users. Now 
after we empathize with the users patient problem,  
06:01 - we are going to create what we call a problem 
statement. And after creating this problem  
06:08 - statements, the next stage of our workflow will 
be the stage where we will have to come up with  
06:14 - ideas that can be best business solutions to the 
problems highlighted in the problem statement.  
06:22 - Now, when we are able to get an idea for 
the problems in the problem statement,  
06:27 - the next action will be for us to design that 
idea into a testable prototype. And after  
06:34 - designing that idea into a testable prototype, we 
will go ahead to test the design to be sure that  
06:42 - it is able to solve the problems in the problem 
statement. So let's get to work. Now outcome here  
06:50 - in figma. And I'll use a fig jam file to walk 
on all the analytical parts of our workflow.  
06:59 - So let's create a fig jam file. And to do that, 
come here and click on the new fig jam File button  
07:06 - there. When you do that, you have created a junk 
file as easy as that. And I'd like to mention that  
07:13 - if you are new to using fie jam, you have nothing 
to worry about. It's a really simple tool to use.  
07:20 - Just follow along, and you'd see that at the 
end of this course, you would be good with using  
07:25 - feature. So I'll close this. And the next thing 
I'll do after creating a fifth gem file is to give  
07:33 - the fifth gem file a name. So I'll call this 
stocks, big jam, you can call it whatever you  
07:40 - want to call it. Now after giving this junk pile 
in him. The next thing to do is to outline the  
07:47 - stages of our workflow here in peach jam. So let's 
do that. So first things first out, zoom into 200%  
07:56 - outcome here to zoom in and out Select Zoom 
to 200% here. And when I zoom in to 200% out,  
08:03 - use a square shape here to write down 
a headline for our workflow. So I would  
08:09 - keep this there, I would select the text to now 
so that I can write my text. And I would say,  
08:17 - workflow stages, then outcome here, and I'll align 
the text to the left. And I'll change the color of  
08:25 - the rectangle to this. And that. Okay, so the 
next thing I'll do is to have sticky notes,  
08:32 - were out outline the workflow stages in. So 
to create a sticky notes in peach jam, I would  
08:39 - come here and now select the sticky note tool 
here. When I select it out, come here and out,  
08:45 - click on the big jam Canvas to have this. Now 
let's select this. And let's expand the width  
08:51 - to align with our sticky notes. So first things 
first, I will change the color of my sticky notes  
08:57 - to this, then I'll click on this Add text 
placeholder here. So that I can write down  
09:04 - all of those workflow stages that I talked about. 
So I would like to make this a list. And I'd like  
09:12 - it to be a bulleted list. So I would come here 
and I would select the bulleted list property  
09:17 - here. Then I would write down the first workflow 
stage, which is this, it says stakeholders present  
09:25 - the problem and the users facing the problem. Now 
I'll create another list item, which is going to  
09:33 - be the next stage of our workflow. And that's 
going to be where the stakeholders will define  
09:39 - the goals for this project. So I would say define 
goals. Let's come here. Let's create some space  
09:45 - here. Now let's outline the next stage of 
our workflow. After the goals are defined,  
09:52 - we view X designers will empathize with the users. 
So let's come here. Let's create the space also.  
09:59 - Now After we the UX designers empathize with the 
users, the next stage of our workflow will be  
10:06 - where we are going to create a problem statement. 
So I would say, creates problem statements.  
10:13 - So let's come here, let's create the space. Now 
after we create a problem statements, the next  
10:20 - stage of our workflow will be the stage, where we 
are going to come up with an idea that can solve  
10:27 - the problems listed in the problem statement. Now, 
after we come up with a best idea that can solve  
10:35 - the problems in the problem statement, the next 
stage of our workflow will be the stage where  
10:41 - we are going to design that idea into a testable 
prototype. So I would say design prototype here.  
10:48 - And after we design that idea into a testable 
prototype, we are going to move over to the  
10:55 - next stage of our workflow, which is going 
to be the stage where we are going to test  
11:01 - that idea that we have designed into a 
prototype. So I would just call that test and  
11:08 - have that spaced. Now we have outlined our 
workflow stages here. So just to make this better,  
11:15 - I would select all of these and I would make 
all of the text bold. To have that outcome here,  
11:22 - I would select this text, and I'll make it bold 
also. Now zoom back to 100%. To see what we have,  
11:31 - and this is okay, so I'll use the hand tool, 
which is this, you can come here to click on it to  
11:37 - select it or just press the H key on your keyboard 
to have it selected. And now grab and shift a  
11:44 - canvas to this point. So now we have outlined our 
workflow stages here right. Now the next thing to  
11:51 - do is for AWS to outline all of the actions that 
will be taken on that each of this workflow stage.  
12:00 - So this means that we are now going to break down 
each of these stage one after another, so that we  
12:07 - know what actions to take at each of these stage 
and how to optimize for our results. So I would  
12:14 - select the Move tool here by clicking on it or by 
pressing the V key on my keyboard to select it.  
12:21 - And I would come here, I would select the 
square tool there so that I can create  
12:26 - this shape like this. And over here, I would write 
a text inside this shape. And that text will be  
12:34 - this first stage out select all of this text here, 
then I'll use CTRL. C, if you are using a Mac,  
12:41 - its command C, I would use that to copy that text. 
And I'll paste it inside this question like this.  
12:48 - Now expand this to this point. Now this is the 
first stage of our workflow right outcome here  
12:56 - now. And I'd have a sticky note here, right under 
that. Now in this sticky note out write out what's  
13:03 - going to happen at this stage, which is the first 
stage of our workflow. Now this stage is the stage  
13:09 - where the stakeholders will present the problem 
to us. And also let us know about the users that  
13:16 - they want us to design for. So in this course, I 
would like us to assume that we have a stakeholder  
13:25 - somewhere or we have a company somewhere that 
wants us to design an app that you can use to  
13:31 - invest in stocks for them, right. So I'll 
paste this in here in this sticky note,  
13:36 - which says users find it really hard to invest 
in stocks using existing investment apps due to  
13:45 - information overload and complex presentation of 
information on the apps. Now, who are the users,  
13:52 - the users are stock investors in Nigeria. So this 
so having this here means that the stakeholders  
14:01 - have presented us with a problem and the 
users facing the problem. So this is sorted.  
14:08 - So let's change the color of the sticky notes. 
Something like this to differentiate it from  
14:13 - this one here. And let's come here. Let's change 
this, to that to differentiate it also. So this  
14:20 - is the first stage of our workflow. And we have 
seen what's going to happen here at this stage.  
14:27 - So let's look at the next stage here, which is the 
stage where the stakeholders will define the goals  
14:34 - of the project. So I would come here, I would 
select this and now duplicate it to duplicate  
14:40 - is Ctrl D. If you are using a Mac, its command 
D. So I'll duplicate this and our habits to here.  
14:47 - I will take out this text inside this 
shape. And out writes define goals there.  
14:55 - I can have in brackets saved by stakeholders. So 
I'll keep this here. Now outcome here also out  
15:02 - duplicates these and out habits, they're right 
on the dish shape, which is a square shape,  
15:07 - right. So inside the sticky notes, I'll take 
all of these out and out. also assume that  
15:13 - we have stakeholders somewhere who sent us 
the goals. That's the ones for this project.  
15:20 - So let's assume that the stakeholders sent us 
this as their goal. And it says, research and help  
15:29 - us us simplify every task needed to make a stock 
investment. So what we have here so far is this,  
15:37 - the stakeholders have presented us with a problem 
and B users facing the problem. And they have  
15:44 - gone ahead to define their expected goal for this 
project. And the expected goal is that they want  
15:53 - us to research and help users simplify every task 
needed to make a stock investment. So let's move  
16:02 - over to the next stage of our workflow, which is 
the stage where we the UX designers will have to  
16:09 - empathize with the users facing the problem. 
So I would come here, I'll duplicate this,  
16:16 - I would have this here. And I would say empathize. 
Now I have this here also. And I'll take out all  
16:23 - we have here. And at this empathize stage, this 
is actually the stage where we the UX designers  
16:30 - will now get to work. So what do we 
do at this stage? What are the actions  
16:36 - that we need to carry out at this stage, so that 
we can say that we have properly empathized with  
16:44 - the users facing the problem. So what we 
are going to do is to interview the users  
16:50 - face to face or send out surveys digitally to 
the users. The purpose for that is so that we  
16:58 - can understand the problems from the perspective 
of the people facing the problem. Now after that,  
17:06 - we are going to create what we call user personas, 
all under this empathize stage. So out, make this  
17:15 - a list, just like this, to have that organized 
properly. And when we are done with the empathize  
17:21 - stage, by carrying out these two actions here, the 
next thing we are going to do is to move over to  
17:27 - the next stage of our workflow, which is the stage 
where we will have to create a problem statements.  
17:35 - So I would come here, I would have this here. And 
I'll change that to create problems statements,  
17:41 - and have this stay here. So at this stage, 
where you the UX designer will be needed  
17:47 - to create a problem statements, what you do 
to create a problem statements, it's easy,  
17:53 - just state the problem of the users with all 
you have gathered from the previous stage,  
17:59 - which is the empathize stage. So after you have 
interviewed the users to understand the problems  
18:06 - from their perspective, and you have created 
user personas for each of the user, what you  
18:12 - do is you'd use all of that data to properly 
state the problem that the users are facing.  
18:19 - Now when you create the problem statement, 
which is you stating the problem properly,  
18:24 - the next thing you do is to move to the next stage 
of our workflow, which is the idea stage. Now,  
18:31 - when you get to the idea stage, let's have 
this here. When we get to the idea stage,  
18:37 - the actions that you take at the idea stage are 
simple actions. All you'd have to do with this,  
18:45 - launch a brainstorming session, then 
during the brainstorming session,  
18:50 - vote for the best idea, when you vote for the 
best idea, select the idea with the highest votes.  
18:58 - And there you have gotten an idea that you can 
then take to the next stage of our workflow,  
19:04 - which is the stage where we are going 
to design that best idea into a testable  
19:10 - prototype. So before we go there, let's select 
this and let's make it a list like this.  
19:16 - Now, let's come here and let's look at the next 
stage here, which is the design prototype stage.  
19:24 - And when you get to this stage, what are the 
actions that you need to take for you to properly  
19:31 - design a workable prototype, we are going to look 
at the actions now. So out have this the here I'll  
19:39 - take all of these out. And the actions that we are 
going to take to properly design a prototype are  
19:47 - all of this. First things first, we are going 
to create an information architecture for the  
19:53 - best idea that we got from the idea stage. When 
we create that in commission architecture, we  
20:01 - are going to use that information architecture to 
create what we call a low fidelity prototype. Now,  
20:08 - after we create that low fidelity prototype, we 
are going to test the low fidelity prototype.  
20:15 - And when the test is successful, we are going 
to go ahead to create a high fidelity prototype  
20:23 - for that best idea that we got from the idea 
stage. Now, after we create the high fidelity  
20:30 - prototype, we are going to move over to the next 
stage of our workflow, which is the stage where  
20:36 - we are going to need to test that high fidelity 
prototype. So I would come here, I'd have this  
20:43 - here, I would say test prototype. And I'll bring 
this here, I can just say usability testing here.  
20:52 - And that's all. Let's come here, let's make all 
of these illest. And that's okay. So what we have  
20:58 - here is a proper breakdown of our workflow. So I 
like to connect all of this so that we understand  
21:04 - that these stages are to be followed one after 
another. So I would select the connector tool  
21:11 - here, you can see where my mouse cursor is on, 
click on it to select it, I would come here out,  
21:16 - select this point, click hold and drag. And 
I would connect with this other point here,  
21:22 - I would select this also connected here. I'll 
do that for all of these other items. Also,  
21:30 - I would have all of them connected. So we are 
going to design our products by following the  
21:36 - breakdown of this workflow. So now that we have 
outlined our workflow stages, and we have broken  
21:42 - down all of our workflow stages like this, the 
next thing we need to do is to start executing  
21:49 - each of the actions that we have outlined here, 
one after another. So let's get to work. So the  
21:56 - first stage of our workflow here is the stage 
where the stakeholders will present us with the  
22:03 - problem and the user space in the problem, right. 
And as you can see, that stage is sorted, because  
22:10 - I assumed that a stakeholder presented us with 
this problem and the users facing the problem.  
22:18 - So this stage is sorted. Now over to the next 
stage, which is the stage where the stakeholders  
22:25 - will state their expected goals for the project. 
And that is sorted also, as you can see here,  
22:33 - I also assumed that the stakeholders has stated 
the expected goals to us, which is to research  
22:41 - and help us simplify every task needed to make 
a stock investment. Now over to the next stage,  
22:50 - which is the stage where we the UX designers 
will get to work. And that is the empathize  
22:56 - stage. And under the empathize stage here, these 
are the actions that we need to take. The first  
23:02 - action is to interview the users face to face, 
or send out surveys digitally to the users. Now  
23:10 - in this course, since this is a lesson, I can't 
show you how to set up a face to face interview.  
23:17 - But I'll show you how to create a digital 
survey using Google Forms. So let's do that.  
23:24 - So I would come here in my browser, and I would 
open a new tab, then come here, I would click on  
23:30 - this menu icon here so that I can access my Google 
Apps out scroll down and out, click on forms here.  
23:37 - And when I do that, I would come here and I would 
click on Blank there, then a blank form will be  
23:44 - created for me. Now I'll give this form a title. 
I can call it stock app UX survey. And that's its  
23:55 - outcome here also, and I'll give the form a name. 
So I can call the form stock up UX survey also,  
24:01 - or you can give it any name at all that you 
want to give it. Now the next thing I would  
24:05 - need to do is to have a form description just 
to describe what the survey form is all about.  
24:12 - So outcome here, and I'll have this and 
it says this survey is carried out by best  
24:19 - technologists. And it is aimed at improving the 
experience of users who want to invest in stocks  
24:26 - from an app without having complex steps. Now you 
can come up with a better description when you  
24:31 - are doing this in real life. Now after that out, 
start passing in the fields that I want the users  
24:38 - to give me a response to, and the first field 
out have here will be an email field. I'd like  
24:44 - to collect the email address of everyone that will 
take part in the survey. So that's going to be my  
24:51 - first field here. So to collect email addresses 
outcome here. I'll click on settings here.  
24:57 - Then I'll expand responses here. You can see 
the responses section here, I'll expand it.  
25:03 - Then in front of this collect email addresses 
option here, I'll turn on this toggle button,  
25:10 - just like that. And that's sorted. Now when I 
come back here, you will see that we have an  
25:15 - email field here, which is going to require 
the user to enter their email address here.  
25:21 - And as you can see, there is a red Asterix 
there, showing that this is a mandatory field,  
25:27 - which means that anyone taking this survey 
must have to enter their email address.  
25:33 - Now let's move over to the next question that 
we are going to ask anyone taking the survey?  
25:40 - And that's going to be us asking them to enter 
their full name. Yeah. So I would come here,  
25:45 - when I type that in, I would change this from 
multiple choice to shut answer just like that,  
25:52 - then I would come here and I would turn on this 
toggle button to make this field a required field,  
25:59 - meaning that anyone taking this survey must 
have to enter their full name. And that's  
26:04 - sorted. So I would come here and I would click 
on the plus sign here to add another question.  
26:09 - Just like that, then this question will be country 
of residence. Now, this is important, because  
26:16 - coming from what the stakeholders presented us 
as a problem and the user space in the problem,  
26:23 - we could see that the stakeholders are actually 
trying to solve a problem for people living in  
26:29 - Nigeria. So it is important to ask anyone taking 
the survey from where they reside. So if someone  
26:37 - from Germany takes the survey, by mistake 
or happenstance, then it means that when we  
26:43 - are collecting the data from the survey, we are 
actually going to ignore that person's imputes.  
26:50 - Because the person is not based in Nigeria. So 
that's why it's going to be important to ask  
26:56 - this question. So I would come here and I would 
make this required also. Now make sure this is  
27:02 - set to short answer also, then I would come here 
and I would click on this button to add another  
27:07 - question. Now this question is going to be 
us asking anyone to can be surveyed enter  
27:12 - their age. And this is also important, because 
usage of apps, and the experience behind the usage  
27:19 - of apps differs by age range. So I would ask this 
question, and I would set this to short answer,  
27:27 - then I would make this a required question. So 
I would go ahead and add another question option  
27:32 - here. So that I can ask my next question, which is 
going to be us asking whoever is taking the survey  
27:40 - to enter their profession? I would keep this short 
answer. And I'll make this required. Then I'll add  
27:47 - another question here. And this question is going 
to be us asking, have you invested in stocks from  
27:55 - a mobile app? Now this is going to be a yes or 
no answer. And Google Forms automatically suggest  
28:03 - this because I have a question mark at the end of 
the question. Now outcome here, and I'll click on  
28:08 - yes as my first option. And I'll click on No as my 
second option, and that's going to be fine. Then  
28:16 - I'll come here and now make this is a required 
question. Then I'll add another question here,  
28:22 - which is going to be select the goals you always 
love to achieve when investing in stocks from a  
28:30 - mobile app. Now, I'll have that in brackets. 
Same select more than one. Now outcome here,  
28:36 - and I'll make sure this is a checkbox option. Now 
mimicking this checkbox option is because I want  
28:42 - the person taking the survey to select 
more than one answer. So I would come here,  
28:48 - I'll type in my first option, which is going 
to be invest quickly. My second option will  
28:55 - be found my wallet with more than one option. 
The third option will be withdraw my dividends  
29:04 - quickly, the fourth option will be easily access 
transaction history. And the final option here  
29:12 - will be to save time. So this is me asking anyone 
taking this survey to tell us what they would  
29:19 - love to achieve more when using a mobile app to 
invest in stocks. So these are all the options  
29:26 - that they can choose from and from the answers 
they select. We the UX designers will understand  
29:33 - what to focus on when designing and what not to 
focus on when designing. So I would come here  
29:40 - and I would make this a required question 
also. And that's fine. And I'll add another  
29:46 - question here. Which is going to be me asking 
anyone taking this survey this question it says  
29:52 - select the frustrations you face when investing 
with the app you are currently using to invest  
29:58 - so out also good Give them the option to select 
more than one answer here. And I'd have checkboxes  
30:05 - selected here. So the first option here will 
be complex and unnecessary graphs, the second  
30:12 - one will be long time to invest. And the third 
option will be excessive ambiguity of information.  
30:21 - The fourth option will be on friendly user 
interface. And the final option will be difficulty  
30:30 - in funding wallets or accounts. Now, this is us 
asking whoever is taking the survey to tell us  
30:37 - the problems that they have with any investment 
app that they're currently using. Now from what  
30:44 - they would select here, we the UX designers will 
understand the problems to tackle and what to  
30:51 - completely avoid when designing our own investment 
up. So outcome here and I would make this a  
30:58 - required question also. And the final question, 
or the final request out have in this survey is  
31:06 - to have the person taking the survey to upload 
their picture. Now, this is not going to be a  
31:12 - mandatory field, we are going to make it optional 
if they like the upload if they like they don't.  
31:18 - So I would come here out, click on the plus sign 
that add question. And I'd come here and select  
31:25 - File Upload. Now outcome here, and I'll click on 
Continue. And I would come here and I'd say upload  
31:33 - your image. And I would make sure this is not 
set to required. That's because I want it to  
31:40 - be optional. And that's fine. So at this stage, 
I'd like for us to preview this survey to see  
31:47 - how it will look like when it is sent out to the 
people facing the problem. So I would come here,  
31:53 - and I would click on this button here, you can see 
where my mouse cursor is on, when I click on it,  
31:58 - I would have a preview of the survey. And this is 
it here. It looks okay. So let's come back here.  
32:05 - And let's click on send. When you click on Send, 
you'd have this pop up show up here. Now you'd  
32:11 - come here and you'd edit this message, 
just in case you want to send this as an  
32:16 - email to whichever person you want to send it 
to. So you would come here and you'd say, vest,  
32:23 - technologies there, you put in your own company's 
name, best technologies, has invited you to  
32:31 - fill in a survey for UX research, or whatever 
you want to say there. And that's fine.  
32:38 - Now this option is only when you want to send 
this survey form an email directly to people,  
32:44 - you would come here and you type in their 
email address. Let's say you type this in,  
32:49 - you would use comma then type in the next email 
and the next email and the next email. Now,  
32:55 - if you don't want to send this as an email, you 
have the option of sending this also adds a link.  
33:02 - Now this option will make it possible for you to 
put this link up on your social media or send it  
33:08 - through WhatsApp or send it through any other app 
to the public so that anyone that stays in Nigeria  
33:14 - can stumble upon the link and take the survey. 
Now to do that, come here and click here. When  
33:21 - you click there, you'll see the link here. Now 
come here and click on this checkbox that says  
33:26 - shorten URL. When you do that, you'd have a 
shorter link. Now you'd come here and just copy  
33:33 - this link. When you copy it, then you can post it 
on LinkedIn, you can post it on Twitter, you can  
33:38 - post it anywhere you want to post it, you can send 
it to anyone. And when they click on the link,  
33:44 - they will be taken to the survey form for them to 
take the survey. Now when they take the survey,  
33:49 - you will be having the option to see the responses 
here. All you do is come back to the form,  
33:56 - click on responses and you'd see all of the 
responses over here. Currently, I have zero  
34:02 - responses. So what's going to happen is out take 
this survey myself, I would take it twice, so that  
34:09 - I would have two responses. And I'll use those two 
responses to continue our research process. Now  
34:17 - take note in real life, you'd have more than two 
responses. So I'll pause this video here. I would  
34:24 - go ahead and out. Take the survey myself twice. So 
I have taken the survey by myself twice. And these  
34:32 - are my responses. As you can see here we have this 
field that says who has responded and these are  
34:38 - the emails of the people that have responded and 
these are their full names and all of that now,  
34:44 - this summary tab here in the responses section 
will just give you a full summary of all the  
34:51 - responses. Now for you to attend to one response 
at a time, come here and click on the individual  
34:59 - tab appear. When you do that, then you can come 
here and select the individual responses based on  
35:07 - their email addresses. Currently, this email is 
and@xyz.com. And, and all of these responses here,  
35:14 - all of these answers are the answers of this 
particular user. If you want to see the answer  
35:21 - from any other user, come here and select 
that with the email of that user. If I select  
35:28 - chicks@xyz.com, you will see that I would have all 
of this show up here. Now, as you can see here,  
35:34 - this is the email of chooks. And this is the full 
name of trucks, trucks, EK, and the country and  
35:41 - city of residence is Nigeria, Enugu, the age is 
24. The profession is importer. Have you invested  
35:48 - in stocks? Yes. Have you invested in stocks from 
a mobile app? Yes. Select the goals you always  
35:54 - love to achieve when investing in stocks from a 
mobile app. And Chuck said to invest quickly to  
36:00 - one my wallet with more than one option to easily 
access transaction history and to save time.  
36:07 - Now, the next question here is select the 
frustrations you face when investing with  
36:13 - the app you are currently using to invest. 
And chucks says, long time to invest complex  
36:19 - and unnecessary graphs, excessive ambiguity of 
information and non friendly user interface.  
36:26 - Now, for the other user, which is n, you can see 
the email of the user here and the name of the  
36:34 - user is M for lucky. And the country and city of 
residence is Nigeria Lagos. I know in my initial  
36:42 - survey form, I did not include city of residence, 
actually. But I just had to include that so that I  
36:47 - can target the particular location where the user 
is staying. And the age is 24. The professional is  
36:55 - mural artist. Have you invested in stocks? Yes. 
Have you invested in stocks from a mobile app?  
37:01 - Yes, select the goals you always love to achieve 
when investing in stocks from a mobile app and MCs  
37:08 - to invest quickly to find my wallet with more than 
one option is the access transaction history save  
37:14 - time and for this question here and select long 
time to invest complex and unnecessary graphs,  
37:21 - excessive ambiguity of information and non 
friendly user interface. Now at the bottom here,  
37:26 - you would also see that the date of submission 
and the time of submission is recorded. So I'll  
37:34 - come back here. And I'd also like to let you 
know that you can, you can export this response  
37:40 - to a spreadsheet. Now, I would advise you that if 
you want to do that, come here, click on summary,  
37:47 - then click on create spreadsheets. When you 
do that, you'd have this option to select,  
37:52 - create a new spreadsheet or select existing 
spreadsheets. Now, if this is your first time,  
37:58 - just create a new spreadsheet. Now I'll keep that 
now out, keep that selected, come here and out,  
38:04 - click on Create. When I do that, I'll have a 
new tab launched. And as you can see, all of my  
38:11 - responses has been exported into the spreadsheets. 
Now you can also choose to come here and make your  
38:17 - analysis from the spreadsheets. And that's okay. 
So after you create your surveys and send them out  
38:25 - and the users or the people that you sent them 
out to send in their responses, you would go ahead  
38:33 - to create what we call user personas for each 
and every user that sent in a response. So at  
38:41 - this stage, I'd like us to see how to create user 
personas and take notes. Creating user personas is  
38:49 - an action you take while you're at the empathize 
stage. Now just understand that this empathize  
38:57 - stage is the stage where you get to know the users 
better and understand their frustrations better.  
39:05 - And that's because it's only when you understand a 
problem better that you can come up with a better  
39:10 - solution for that problem. So let's go ahead and 
let's see how to create user personas for each  
39:17 - of the user that sent in a response to our survey. 
So I would come here now. And I would select the  
39:24 - text tool here. And I'd have this here, I would 
say user personas, I would keep that selected.  
39:31 - I'll change this text from a normal text to a sub 
heading text. And I'd make this bold, then I would  
39:39 - come here and I'll change the color of this text 
to that. So this is going to be our user persona  
39:46 - section. Let's duplicate this. Let's come up here. 
Let's call this section, workflow break down.  
39:54 - However you want to call it, it's fine. That's 
okay. So I'll just scroll down to the user persona  
39:59 - section. And the first thing I'd have here is 
the image of the user that I want to create a  
40:05 - persona for. So I would come here, I would select 
the square tool here to have a square shape here,  
40:11 - which I am going to use to place the image of 
that user in. Now this is necessary, whether the  
40:18 - user sends in an image or not, you can just have 
these here, if the user does not send in an image,  
40:24 - then you leave this blank, go ahead and do 
the rest. But if the user sends in an image,  
40:28 - then you place the image in here. 
Now there's one way to place an image  
40:33 - into a shape here in feature, all you have to do 
is keep the shape selected, right click on it,  
40:40 - then go to plugins and use the Unsplash 
plugins for that. So I would come here,  
40:46 - I would launch that plugin. And I would come in 
here and I'll type in African woman. So I can have  
40:53 - an image of an African woman show up there. So I'd 
come here and out select this. And that's okay.  
40:59 - So the next thing to do is to have all of these 
details about this person who has this image.  
41:06 - Now the name here is an felucca, the country 
and city is Nigeria, Lagos the age is 24  
41:12 - Professional mural artists. Now, over 
here, I would say an is a mural artist  
41:18 - resident in Lagos, Nigeria, and is also a stock 
investor who invests in stocks with existing stock  
41:27 - investing apps in Nigeria. And this is like his 
summary about her personality. Now, I'll go ahead  
41:34 - and out highlight her frustrations with the 
existing investment apps that she used in Nigeria  
41:40 - and out also highlights the goals that she aims to 
achieve with an investment app. So outcome here,  
41:49 - now have this here, outpaced this. And over here, 
these are the things that she wishes that she had  
41:55 - as an experience with an investment app. And these 
are her current frustrations. Now all of these  
42:03 - details about an was gotten from the response 
that she gave us when she took this survey that  
42:11 - we created. So you can see how this connects. So 
let's go ahead and let's create a user persona for  
42:18 - the other user that took the survey. So that 
is going to be chooks. So I would come here,  
42:25 - I would have this shape here. And I would run the 
Unsplash plugin on that shape. And I would type in  
42:33 - African man. And I would go with this here. And 
that's okay. So I would have this hair for chooks.  
42:40 - This is his name, and his country and city, age, 
profession, and all of that out also highlight  
42:48 - his goals and frustrations. And that's fine 
still. So what we have done so far is this,  
42:55 - we have concluded the empathize stage, we 
have gotten to know about the problem from  
43:01 - the perspective of the users. And we have created 
user personas for each user that took our survey.  
43:09 - So we are going to move ahead to the next stage 
of our workflow here, which is the stage where we  
43:15 - are going to create a problem statement based on 
all we have gathered during the empathize stage.  
43:22 - Now this really makes sense because you can 
create a better problem statement when you  
43:28 - understand the problem better. And the way to 
understand the problem better is to empathize  
43:35 - with the people facing the problem. And that's 
what we have done. So let's go ahead and let's  
43:41 - create a problem statement based on what we have 
learned. So I'll duplicate this outcome here,  
43:48 - I'd say problem statements. And for me going by 
all we have learned from the empathize stage,  
43:55 - this is my problem statement. My problem 
statement states that users are frustrated with  
44:01 - existing investment apps, as a result of excessive 
ambiguity of information and complex steps. These  
44:10 - consents negatively affect the experience of these 
users. Now, this is my problem statements and  
44:18 - this is the problem that our try solve. So, if we 
come up here, you will see that we have empathized  
44:26 - with the users and we have created a problem 
statement. So the next stage of our workflow is  
44:32 - the idea stage, which is the stage where we 
have to come up with an idea that can solve the  
44:40 - problems that we have in the problem statement 
and what actions are we to take at this stage.  
44:47 - So at the idea stage, the first thing we are 
going to do is to set up a brainstorming session  
44:54 - where we are going to invite other designers, 
product managers, business managers Lawyers,  
45:00 - software engineers, and so on and so forth. 
Now, when we invite all of these people, we  
45:06 - are going to present them with enough information 
about the problems in the problem statement, and  
45:12 - ask them to come up with ideas that can possibly 
solve the problems in the problem statement. Now,  
45:19 - when each and every one of these people 
that we have invited, come up with an idea,  
45:24 - the next thing to do is to read out all of these 
ideas to everyone and call a vote for the best  
45:32 - idea. Now, the idea with the highest votes should 
be selected. And when that is done, it means that  
45:39 - you are ready to move to the next stage of our 
workflow, which is the stage where you'd have  
45:46 - to design that idea into a testable prototype. So 
before we move over to this stage here, I'd like  
45:53 - to come here out also highlights that this stage 
is the idea stage. This is the idea stage. And  
46:01 - since this is going to be a brainstorming 
session stage, and obviously I can't have  
46:06 - a brainstorming session here in this lesson, 
it's going to be something that you'd set up  
46:11 - with the people you want to set it up with, beat 
on Zoom discord, beat real life, anyhow, you want  
46:17 - to set it up, that's fine. So I'll just highlight 
this stage here. And what I'm going to do is,  
46:24 - I would assume that I conducted a brainstorming 
session offline, just so that we can learn better.  
46:31 - And I'd also assume that during that brainstorming 
session, we arrived at an idea. So I'd have this  
46:39 - here selected idea. And I would paste this as our 
selected idea. Now this is the selected idea for  
46:47 - this course, it says Create an investment app 
where graphs are represented with text, where  
46:55 - users will have the option to fund the account 
and wallet via bank transfer or their debit cards,  
47:03 - where recent transaction history will be easily 
accessible. And were plain and easy to understand  
47:12 - English will be mostly used. Now if you 
look at this idea, you'd see that this idea  
47:19 - solves the problems that we have in this problem 
statements. And this problem statement was gotten  
47:26 - from all we learned during the empathize stage. 
And we were able to learn all we learned during  
47:33 - this stage because we created a survey form and 
sent out the survey to use us so you can see how  
47:42 - everything connects. So now that we have an idea 
that we can use to solve the problem, the next  
47:48 - stage here is the design prototype stage. And at 
this stage, the actions that we need to take all  
47:55 - of these First things first, we need to create an 
information architecture for this best idea that  
48:03 - was selected during the idea stage. So I would 
come here, I would scroll down to this point.  
48:09 - And I would have this here, I'd say information 
architecture. Now before we create the information  
48:18 - architecture, let's understand what an information 
architecture is and why it is important  
48:25 - to create one. So the information architecture of 
a mobile app is the way you organize and arrange  
48:32 - information on the mobile app that will help the 
users have that mobile app to accomplish their  
48:39 - task on that mobile app without a bad experience. 
So it is in the information architecture,  
48:47 - that you will decide what features and what 
information we exist on each page of the app,  
48:53 - and each step of the app. So let's go ahead. 
And let's create an information architecture  
48:59 - for this idea. Now, the way to start creating 
your information architecture is to first of all,  
49:07 - define the goals of the users who will use 
the app, then define the task that the users  
49:15 - have to complete to achieve their goals on the 
app. So outcome here, and I'd have this here.  
49:23 - So this here is the goal of the user to invest 
with a good experience. Now the user task here  
49:30 - are the actions that the user will have to take 
to achieve this goal. Now, what are the task,  
49:36 - the user will have to sign up to the application 
as a new user or log in as an existing user  
49:42 - then fund their account or their wallet, then use 
the fund that they have in their account or wallet  
49:49 - to invest in any stock of their choice. So 
if they can accomplish this task, this task  
49:56 - and this task, it means that they have achieved 
that goal on that app. So after defining the  
50:04 - goals of the user and stating the task that 
the user has to complete to achieve that goal,  
50:10 - we are going to go ahead to create our information 
architecture flow, and for the sake of time out,  
50:16 - speed up this process, and I'll explain it so that 
you can understand. So what we have here is our  
50:22 - information architecture flow. And our zoom in so 
that I can break down this flow one after another  
50:29 - and also show you how to come up with a flow like 
this. This is the start point of the flow. This is  
50:36 - where the user launches the app. So when the user 
launches the app, the user will have two options,  
50:42 - one to sign up and want to log in. So let's go 
with the signup flow here. Now, if the user is  
50:48 - trying to sign up, the user will be required to 
sign up with their email address, phone number  
50:53 - and password. And after this step, the user will 
have to verify their phone number. Now, after the  
51:00 - phone number is verified, the user will be taken 
to the homepage of the application. When the user  
51:07 - gets to the homepage of the application, the user 
will have all of these options here. And the first  
51:13 - route or the first option here will be the menu 
icon, which will be on the homepage. The user will  
51:19 - also have the account balance displayed on the 
homepage, the user will have a fund account option  
51:26 - that they can use to fund the account still on the 
homepage. And still on the homepage. The recent  
51:33 - transactions by the user will be displayed there 
on the homepage. Now, still, on the homepage,  
51:39 - we are going to have a referral banner. Still on 
the homepage, we are going to have an invest route  
51:46 - that the users can take if they wish to invest in 
stocks. Now still, on the homepage, we are going  
51:53 - to have a transact option, just in case the user 
wishes to deposit or withdraw. So all of this is  
52:00 - on the homepage. Now let's look at the flow of the 
first item here, which is the Menu icon. Now if  
52:07 - the user clicks on the menu icon, which is on the 
homepage, the user will see all of these options,  
52:13 - recent transactions, card management, investment 
portfolio request statements and settings. Now,  
52:20 - just for the sake of those who don't know what a 
menu icon is, if you go to an app or a website,  
52:27 - using your mobile phone, you would always have 
this icon here at the top that when you click on  
52:33 - it, you'd have a drop down or you'd have a menu 
bar sliding from the left or from the right now,  
52:39 - that's what we call the Menu icon. And most mobile 
apps have that. So this is going to be all that we  
52:47 - show up when the user accesses the menu icon route 
now for the account balance, or that's going to  
52:53 - show a base available balance. And that's all. Now 
for the fund accounts option. This is the flow,  
52:59 - the user will have to choose a method. And 
this is important for the experience. Because  
53:04 - from our user research, it was clear to us 
that the users actually want an experience  
53:10 - where they would have the option to fund their 
account with more than one option. So when they  
53:16 - choose a method, then they would go ahead to 
find the account with that method that they have  
53:21 - chosen. So that's what the fund accounts route 
right now for the recent transactions route.  
53:28 - All the user will have when they access a recent 
transaction will be the transaction details.  
53:35 - And that's okay. Now we have the referral banner 
option here. And when the user access the routes,  
53:41 - they would have a referral promo code that they 
can copy you know and send to a friend to join  
53:46 - the app for all of that and all of that. And 
that's fine. Now we have the InVEST route here.  
53:52 - When a user accesses this route, the user will 
see a list of stocks that they can invest in  
53:59 - and will also see their stock portfolio that they 
had invested in. So if the user access one of the  
54:06 - stocks that's been listed, the user will see the 
detail for that stock. And if they like what they  
54:13 - see in the detail, they will go ahead to invest. 
And that's a good flow. So if you come here,  
54:20 - we have this route here, which is the transact 
route. When the user accesses this route,  
54:25 - the user will have the option to make a deposit, 
which is also like funding the account you get.  
54:32 - And the user will also have the option to make 
a withdrawal from the account. So this is just  
54:39 - the basic information architecture flow for this 
app. And it is always important for you to create  
54:45 - this information architecture, so that you will 
understand and organize the steps that the user  
54:51 - will take on the app. It is also important so that 
you can also streamline the core features that  
54:59 - each page Your app will have. Now if you remember, 
that was the signup proud, the login routes is  
55:07 - still the same, because all you have to do here 
to login is just enter your email address and your  
55:12 - password, then you'll be taken to the homepage. 
Still, when you get to the homepage, every other  
55:17 - theme is the same. So that's that if you have any 
questions on the information architecture here,  
55:24 - draw my attention to it. And I'm there to help. 
So if you come here now, in our flow breakdown,  
55:31 - you'd see that under the design prototype stage, 
we have created our information architecture.  
55:38 - The next action at this stage is to create a low 
fidelity prototype of the best idea using the  
55:46 - information architecture. Now before we do that, 
I'd love to explain what a low fidelity prototype  
55:53 - is. So a low fidelity prototype is a dummy 
version of your final design for an app. Now,  
56:00 - the question you may ask is this, why do we 
need to design a dummy version? Now this is it.  
56:06 - Designing a dummy version is important because 
at this stage of trying to figure everything out,  
56:13 - your design, and your design process can be 
subject to lots of changes, and imputes from the  
56:20 - stakeholders. Now, it's just like building a dummy 
house first, before you build the main house. Now,  
56:26 - if you use paper to build a dummy house first, 
before building the main house, it's going to be  
56:33 - a lot easier when the owner of the house comes 
to make a correction or comes to make a change.  
56:39 - Since it's a paper, you don't have much to lose, 
all you have to do is just tear it and put it  
56:45 - back in seconds. But if you go ahead to build the 
main house first, and the owner of the house comes  
56:51 - and says, Okay, I don't want this design here, I 
don't want that there, it means that you'd have to  
56:58 - break down that part of the house and rebuild that 
part of the house with all of the resources that  
57:04 - you have put into building that part of the house. 
And that's going to be a lot more hectic compared  
57:10 - to you using a paper to just build a prototype 
or a model of the house. So that's basically  
57:17 - what a low fidelity prototype is. And that's why 
it is important for you to have a low fidelity  
57:22 - prototype, then take that to the stakeholders 
for correction and changes and imputes and all  
57:29 - of that. Now, when the low fidelity prototype has 
been accepted and agreed on, then you can go ahead  
57:36 - to design the real app itself, which is the high 
fidelity prototype. So let's go ahead and let's  
57:43 - see how to create a low fidelity prototype of 
our best idea. So we are going to do that using  
57:50 - a figma design file. So I would come here, I would 
go to figma. And I'll create a new design file.  
57:57 - And I'll call this stock investment app. And out 
come here and out, rename the page one to low  
58:06 - fidelity. And this page is going to contain all 
our low fidelity screens. So let's go ahead and  
58:14 - let's start. So to design low fidelity screens 
is easy. And it is easy because you don't need  
58:22 - a design system for that. Like you don't need 
a style library. To do that. You don't need a  
58:29 - component library. To do that. You don't need 
all of that, all you have to do is focus on the  
58:36 - user task. So if you come here, you'd see that 
our user task on this app is to sign up a login  
58:44 - on your account or wallet and invest. And if 
a user accomplish all of these tasks, it means  
58:50 - that the user will achieve their goal on this app, 
which is to invest in stocks. So we are going to  
58:58 - design a low fidelity screams around these user 
task. So let's come back here and I've picked  
59:05 - my design file. And let's see what it is to create 
low fidelity screams, all you have to do is select  
59:12 - the frame tool, then go with any template of 
your choice, I would go with iPhone 13 Promax,  
59:18 - and not have that. So the next thing I'll do 
is to just come here. And since this is going  
59:24 - to be the splash screen, I'll just have this 
logo stay here out align it to the center,  
59:30 - horizontally and to the center vertically, then 
I would go ahead to create the login screen,  
59:36 - the signup screen and all of that. And actually, 
the way I like doing it is this, I like to segment  
59:43 - the screams into categories using the user 
task. This section or this segment should  
59:50 - be four authentication screens. So I'll go ahead, 
speed up this process and have other screens here.  
59:57 - Then I'll explain how I came about all of that. 
Now before I do that, I may have missed something  
60:03 - here. I know some people who are new to fit 
jam may not understand how these connectors are  
60:09 - created. Now all you have to do is use the 
connector to select it, click on the point, then  
60:16 - you connect it anyhow, you want to connect 
it, you can take your connector anywhere,  
60:21 - connect any shape that you are trying 
to connect, and that's fine. And when  
60:25 - your connector is created, you can actually play 
around with it, you can click on it to select it,  
60:30 - grab the points, take it up, take it down, anyhow, 
you want to play around with it, it's fine.  
60:35 - Now you can also select the connector and change 
the color of the connector, just like this. So all  
60:42 - of these connection lines were created using the 
connector tool here. So let's go back to our figma  
60:49 - design file. And out pause this video here and 
come back with all of our low fidelity screams,  
60:54 - then I'll explain further. So what we have here 
are low fidelity screens for the authentication  
61:01 - task. So let's zoom in. As you can see, here, 
we have the splash screen, which is this. Now  
61:07 - after the splash screen, we have this screen where 
the user will have to choose that authentication  
61:13 - action, which is either to login or to sign up. 
Now to create this button here, you don't need to  
61:18 - use an auto layout or any of that, all you just 
have to do is select the rectangle to like this  
61:25 - created anyhow, you want to create it, then come 
here, select the text to and you can just say  
61:31 - login or sign up or whatever you want to have. 
They're just like this. That's how I created  
61:37 - this. And I did not have to come up with a color. 
And it's advisable for you not to use colors when  
61:42 - creating your low fidelity screams. And that's 
because if you have colors chosen, it may distract  
61:48 - the stakeholders when you are presenting the 
low fidelity screams to them at this stage,  
61:55 - all you should focus on is the user experience. 
So having colors or making the low fidelity  
62:01 - screams look good, may distract the stakeholders 
away from the user experience. So that's how I  
62:07 - came up with the buttons there. And here also, 
this impute fields, I just use the rectangle,  
62:14 - the rectangle to create a rectangle shape there, 
I added a stroke. And I took out the field color  
62:20 - and I had that then I had a text inside there 
saying email just like that. And this button,  
62:27 - we know how to do that. I duplicated all of 
this. And I had one more field here for the phone  
62:32 - number. And my button is still here. Then here we 
have this field for a verification code. And over  
62:38 - here I have the Verify button that Okay, so all 
of the screens here are for the authentication  
62:45 - task. Now let's scroll down to the next task, 
which is going to be the fund wallets task. And  
62:52 - that task actually will happen from the 
homepage. So that's why I created a low fidelity  
62:59 - version of our homepage. So you can 
see that we don't have too much of  
63:03 - information here. So if I scroll down, you'll see 
that I have the fund accounts pop up action here.  
63:10 - Now this element is going to show up when a user 
clicks on fund accounts here. When they do that,  
63:17 - this pop up will show up for them to choose the 
method that they want to fund the account with.  
63:24 - And that's okay, so this is easy to create, 
just have a rectangle like this and have your  
63:30 - text inside of it. Then the background of 
this navigation section is also a rectangle  
63:36 - that I had across the screen like this, and 
I changed the color to something like this,  
63:43 - just like that. That's easy. So over here, this is 
a rectangle also with a text on it. And I have a  
63:50 - rectangle here with a corner radius of 16 px. And 
that's okay here, we know how to create a button.  
63:56 - And this is just text. Now for this icon here, I 
got that from an icon plugin, I used the feather  
64:04 - icons plugin to have that sorted. So this task is 
complete, we have the font accounts button here,  
64:13 - which if a user clicks on it, you will have this 
pop up show up like this. Now let's move over to  
64:19 - the next task on our app. And the next task here 
is to invest. So if I come here, and I scroll  
64:28 - down, you'll see that I have this screens for the 
InVEST task. Now this is the section for that we  
64:35 - have this page here we have this icon we have this 
text here. Now I have this section which is like  
64:42 - the list of stocks to invest in. I have this 
search bar here. I have this search field here  
64:48 - which is also easy to create. All you have to do 
is create a rectangle give it a corner reduce of  
64:53 - let's say 16 Or let's say 816 is a lot. Then come 
here take out the the fill color and give it a  
65:01 - stroke Hello, and you have that, then you have a 
text inside there, that's really easy to create,  
65:07 - then I have the list of stocks here. So I just 
have a rectangle here also with this text on top  
65:12 - of it. So it's also easy to create, all you 
have to do is just have something like this,  
65:17 - then give it a canary use of 16, then take the 
color down the beats to this point, then have  
65:24 - your text written on top of its plot away, then 
keep this here, then have this plus 234 percent.  
65:32 - They're all any number that you're okay with. So 
that's how I created this. And if you scroll down,  
65:38 - you'll see that we have the your stock portfolio 
section, which has this also, we know how to  
65:43 - create this. And over here we have the navigation 
section. And that's okay. So the next page here,  
65:51 - let's zoom out a bit. The next page here is the 
stock Details page. Now, this is all assuming that  
65:58 - a user is interested in this stock here, you can 
see where my mouse cursor is on. So if a user is  
66:04 - interested in this stock, and the user goes ahead 
to click on it, this details page will show up  
66:11 - for the stock showing the details of that stock 
and the company that owns the stock, you'd have  
66:18 - the company logo here. And you'd have the stock 
percentage and all of that there, you'd have the  
66:23 - interest for that stock, minimum cap volume, about 
the company, the valuation rank and all of that,  
66:30 - then you'd have an invest button here. And I think 
by now we know how to create all of the elements  
66:35 - here. Now, if a user clicks on the InVEST button, 
they would go to this page where they would have  
66:41 - to enter the amounts that they wish to invest in 
that stocks with. And I believe on this page here,  
66:48 - we know how to create all of the elements 
that we have here. Now, if a user clicks on  
66:54 - the next button here, after entering, the amount 
they wish to invest in that stocks with the user  
67:00 - will be taken to the next page here, which is 
going to display the summary of the investments  
67:06 - they're about to make. Over here, they would have 
the amount that they typed in here, display here,  
67:12 - the minimum cap, the interest value, and so many 
other details, and so many other details that are  
67:17 - not listed here. Now, if the user is okay with 
that, the user clicks on the Proceed button, and  
67:24 - the next page that user will be taken to is the 
success page indicating that that investment  
67:31 - is successful. Now the user will have the option 
to click on the back to home button here. And  
67:38 - that's that it means that that task, which is 
the Invest task has been successful. So for us  
67:46 - to properly present low fidelity screens like this 
for testing and for impute and for opinions. And  
67:53 - for all of that. For us to properly do that, it 
means that we need to make a prototype of this  
68:00 - low fidelity screens, so that we can present 
them properly for testing and for imputes from  
68:06 - the stakeholders. So let's go ahead and let's do 
that. I'll click on the prototype option here.  
68:13 - So let's start with the splash screen. So 
out select out, click on the splash screen  
68:20 - to select it. When the splash screen is selected, 
you'd have this point here, all you have to do is  
68:28 - click on it, hold it and drag it to the screen 
of destination. So I would want the users to go  
68:34 - from the splash screen to this screen here. Now 
when I connect this splash screen to this other  
68:41 - screen here, you'll see that figma will bring up 
this interaction details card for us. So that we  
68:48 - can set the mode of our interaction. So over 
here I have the On Click event. And the action  
68:56 - for that onclick event is a navigate to action. So 
what this means is that when the splash screen is  
69:02 - clicked, we are going to navigate to this screen 
here, which is iPhone that in Promax two, this  
69:10 - is the name here actually, you can actually it is 
advisable for you to rename all of your screens,  
69:15 - that's the best way to do it. So this practically 
means when the splash screen is clicked on,  
69:22 - navigate to this other screen, which is this one 
here. Now we have an animation section here that  
69:30 - we can set the animation of that transition 
or the animation of that navigation. So  
69:37 - currently to set instance, I can come 
here and set this to smart animate,  
69:42 - then set this to ease in and out and out. Set 
the animation delay time to 800 milliseconds,  
69:50 - just type in 800 there and press the Enter key on 
your keyboard and figma will add the milliseconds  
69:57 - for you. Now this animation settings is optional. 
The most important thing here is that we have set  
70:04 - the event and the action that will be triggered by 
that event, then we have sets to destination frame  
70:12 - for that action. And that's okay. So that's 
sorted. Now outcome here, out, click on this  
70:18 - button. And I will say, okay, when a user clicks 
on this login button, they should go to the login  
70:24 - screen, which is this. Now for the Interaction 
Details, ugly with set like this. This is the  
70:29 - setting we had before now. So I'll leave it set 
like that. Now, for the sign up button. When a  
70:34 - user clicks on the sign up button, it means the 
user is a new user. So I would like that user  
70:40 - to be taken to the signup page, which is this one 
here. Now, when the user goes to the login page,  
70:46 - and the user enters their email and their 
password, it means that they would have to  
70:51 - click on the login button. And when they click on 
the login button, I'd like them to go straight to  
70:58 - the home page, which is this. Now remember, 
for a user to log in, it means the user is an  
71:04 - existing user. Now, when a user selects the Sign 
Up option here, it means the user is a new user,  
71:11 - and the user will have to enter their email 
address, phone number and password right.  
71:17 - Now when they do that, it means they would have 
to have their phone number verified first. So  
71:23 - when the user clicks on sign up, the user 
will be taken to the verification code page.  
71:29 - And when the user's phone number is verified, 
the user will then be taken to the homepage. And  
71:36 - that's fine. So you have seen that we have created 
the authentication flow. So let's come over here  
71:43 - on the homepage, let's work on the next task. 
Now the next task is to fund the accounts, right.  
71:51 - And to fund the accounts, the user will have 
to click on the fund accounts button. Now when  
71:58 - they do that, we are going to want a pop up to 
show up on the screen. And that pop up should  
72:05 - show this card here that will that will require 
the user to choose the method that they want to  
72:12 - fund their accounts with. Let's come here in 
our Interaction Details. Over here, it's an  
72:17 - On Click event. That's okay. Now, over here, we 
have the Navigate to option. And that's not what  
72:24 - we want, we want a popup to show up on that same 
screen, we don't want the user to leave that page  
72:30 - that the user is on, we want the user to still 
stay on that page, but have a pop up show up. So  
72:38 - how do we make that happen, we are going to 
change this from navigates to to open overlay.  
72:44 - When we change it to open overlay, we are going to 
come here and select the center option, because I  
72:51 - would want this pop up to stay at the center of 
the screen here. So over here, I would keep this  
72:58 - selected, which is closed when clicking outside 
and out. Also keep this add background behind  
73:04 - overlay options selected, then for the opacity of 
the background overlay out, keep it set to 25%.  
73:11 - Now for the animation, you can still keep it set 
instance or come here and select any other option  
73:17 - of your choice. So that's okay. And we are okay 
with that. Now, if a user selects bank transfer  
73:24 - or debit card, they will be taken to another page 
where they would have to process that transaction  
73:29 - method. So you can also come here, if you don't 
mind, let's click on Design, you can come here and  
73:36 - duplicate this page and and create a low fidelity 
screen for that you can call these bank transfer.  
73:45 - And you can have whichever element you want 
to have here. And you can go ahead to have  
73:50 - the debit card page also that the user will go 
to when they select the debit card option here.  
73:57 - But that's not the point here. So I'll take 
this out. Now we are done with the fund wallet  
74:03 - task. So the next task is the Invest task. 
And this task will happen from the homepage.  
74:12 - It is when the users go to the homepage, that 
they would click on this invest option here for  
74:18 - them to go to the InVEST page so that they can 
invest in stocks. So from this homepage here,  
74:24 - outcome held click on prototype. From this 
homepage here, I would select this invest button  
74:31 - here. And I'll create a connection to this page. 
And that's okay. So when a user clicks on that  
74:38 - invest button at the navigation section there on 
the homepage, that user will be taken to this page  
74:44 - here, which is the Invest page where the user will 
see the list of stocks that they can invest in and  
74:51 - their stock portfolio. So if a user comes to this 
invest page, the task we want them to complete  
74:58 - is to invest So let's say the user is cool with 
this stock here and the user wishes to invest  
75:06 - in this stock, I would select it, 
then I would create a connection  
75:10 - like this. This means that when the user clicks on 
this stock, the user will go to the stock details  
75:16 - page for that stock. And when the user is okay 
with that stock details that the user sees here,  
75:22 - the user will click on the InVEST button here. 
And the user will go here to this other page,  
75:28 - where the user will have to enter the amount 
that they wish to invest in that stocks with.  
75:34 - And when the user enters the amount they 
wish to invest with, the user will click on  
75:41 - the Next button, which will take the user to 
this page here where the user will see a summary  
75:47 - of the investment the user is about to make. And 
when the user is okay with all the user sees here,  
75:53 - the user will click on proceed and 
the investment, which is the task  
75:59 - will be completed. So what we have here is we 
are done creating a low fidelity screens. And  
76:05 - we can present a low fidelity screens for testing 
now. So how do we do that, I would come here,  
76:11 - I would select the splash screen, because that's 
where the whole journey starts from right? When I  
76:17 - select it, I would come here, and I would click on 
this presents button here to have that presented,  
76:23 - a new tab will be launched for that. So I would 
come here, and I would click on the Enter full  
76:30 - screen option here you can see where my mouse 
cursor is on. Now, this is the presentation,  
76:36 - I would present to the stakeholders, which are 
my employers or the owners of the app. So I will  
76:42 - take this presentation to them to demonstrate the 
user experience that I have come up with that will  
76:49 - enable the users to accomplish their task on this 
app. So I would go from here, I would click on  
76:56 - this screen. And I'll explain to the stakeholders 
at this point that existing users can click on  
77:02 - login. And new users can click on sign up. So I 
would demonstrate these as a new user, I would say  
77:10 - okay, when they click on sign up, they would come 
here enter their email, phone number and password.  
77:15 - When they click on the Sign up button, they would 
have to enter a verification code. And when they  
77:20 - are verified, they would go to the homepage. Now, 
if they want to invest, it means they have to fund  
77:27 - the account. So I would click on the fund account 
button to demonstrate to them that in this case,  
77:34 - now we have a bank transfer method and debit card 
method, I would say okay, if the users go ahead  
77:41 - to fund to fund the accounts, then it means the 
users are ready to invest. So for them to invest,  
77:49 - they would come down here and click on the InVEST 
button there. When we use that those that the user  
77:55 - will see list of stocks that they can invest in. 
And if the user chooses to invest in any of the  
78:02 - stock, let's use this, for example, they would 
click on it, when they click on it, the user  
78:07 - will be taken to the stock details page for that 
stock. And when the user is satisfied with the  
78:14 - details of the stock, the user will click on the 
InVEST button here, then the user will be required  
78:21 - to enter the amount they wish to invest in that 
stocks with when the user does that, the user will  
78:28 - click on the Next button here. And when the user 
clicks on that next button, the user will see a  
78:34 - summary of the investment they are about to make. 
And if the user is satisfied, the user clicks on  
78:41 - the Proceed button here and the investment 
will be successful. And when the user is done,  
78:48 - the user clicks on back to home, and the user will 
be taken back to the homepage. So a presentation  
78:55 - like this will really reveal the experience that 
the user will have using this product. So if  
79:03 - your low fidelity prototype has been accepted 
by the stakeholders, it means that it is now  
79:10 - time for you to go ahead and start the process of 
designing your high fidelity prototype, which is  
79:18 - going to be like the real design version of your 
app, or the final design version of your app.  
79:24 - And it is at that stage that you'd focus on themes 
like colors, typography, effects, components,  
79:32 - library style library, and all of that. So in 
this course, let's assume that our stakeholders  
79:39 - gave us a pass for these low fidelity screams 
and they are okay with it. Let's assume that our  
79:46 - stakeholders now want us to go ahead to design the 
real version of the app. So what do we do? Let's  
79:53 - click on Design. Come here. Create a new page 
and call this Hi Fi deleting. So at this stage,  
80:02 - I'd like to welcome everyone to the most 
interesting part, which is the part where we  
80:07 - start building our designs from scratch. So 
first things first, I'll go ahead to create  
80:14 - my style library. And I will start by creating 
my typography styles. So I will do that using  
80:22 - the Material Design version to guide. So I 
would come over here, I would go to material.io.  
80:29 - And when I come here out, click on Design. When I 
click on Design out, come here on the left side,  
80:36 - and I'll click on typography, then I would select 
the type system. And when I do that, I would come  
80:43 - here. So the first thing that I would have set 
is the typeface or font family that I want to use  
80:51 - for this project. For this project, I would love 
to use the rubric font family. So I would come  
80:59 - here, and I would select it here for headlines 
and subtitles, then I would go ahead to select  
81:05 - it here for body and captions, just like that. 
Now I'll use the data here in this type scale  
81:12 - to create my typography styles. Now let's start 
with creating headline textiles for this project.  
81:18 - Now since this is a mobile app project, I 
won't see the need to have a headline one text,  
81:24 - same for the headline to text. So I would go 
with the headline for textile as my own headline  
81:30 - one textile just because this is a mobile app 
design and this size of text is going to look  
81:36 - too big for a mobile app. So I would come here 
out click on headline for and I would use these  
81:42 - details here. So I would come here I'll create a 
frame here where my textiles are going to stay in  
81:49 - so I would say headline one a duplicate this 
out say headline one bold. So outloud say  
81:56 - headline two now this is me getting everything 
set before I start applying the details that  
82:02 - out get here from the type scale generator. So 
outcome here out, duplicate this and out see  
82:09 - headline to bold and out come here out have this 
out see a headline three. And this is going to  
82:18 - be headline three bold, and that's going to be 
that for my headline textiles for this project.  
82:24 - Now I'll go ahead to have my body textiles. So I 
would come here out, prepare this for body large.  
82:31 - And I'd have this be a body large 
bold textile, then I would go with  
82:42 - body small here. And I'd have this as Bodhi small 
bald. Now this is my own style. And this is my own  
82:46 - pattern. I am not saying this is the standard out 
there. I'm just doing this because this is what I  
82:52 - feel will give me the best design. Now come here. 
This will be for my button text and I'll have a  
83:00 - caption text. So after having all of this set out, 
come here out select the headline one text here.  
83:07 - And I will use the headline for textile here in 
material design. Just like I said I would use this  
83:14 - for my headline one textile. So the font family 
sets Rubik, the width is set to Normal, which is  
83:21 - regular, the size is set to 35. And the letter 
spacing is set to 0.25 px. So I would go ahead and  
83:28 - I would have all of these sets. So I would come 
here keep this selected, how to set this to Rubik  
83:34 - and how to set this to regular and for the letter 
spacing out come here and out set this to 0.25 px,  
83:42 - and for the size out set it to 35 px. Now I'll use 
these same settings for this headline one text for  
83:50 - the headline, one bold text, the only difference 
will be that this is going to be a bold text and  
83:56 - this is going to be a regular text. So I 
would select this. Now to set this to 35.  
84:02 - I would set this to beak and I'll keep it set 
to bold like I said, and I'll make this 0.25 px  
84:09 - and that's okay, so I'll go ahead and now do 
same for headline to headline three body large  
84:16 - body large bowed down to the caption text. Now 
for the headline to text here, I would come here  
84:22 - in material design and I would use the headline 
five textile for my own headline to textile. So  
84:29 - the font families Rubik, the weight is normal, 
the size is 24. So I would set the size to 24.  
84:36 - And for the weights out, keep it set regular 
and for the font family. I'll keep it set to  
84:42 - Rubik. Now the letters business zero px, so I 
can just keep it set at 0% or just come in here  
84:49 - and type in zero px, and that's fine. I would 
use the same setting for the headline to bold,  
84:55 - but the difference will be that this is going to 
be a bold text So I would come here, I would set  
85:01 - this to 24. Send this to Rubik. Keep this set 
to zero, keep the letter spacing set to zero,  
85:09 - and then keep this sets bold. So I can have that. 
Now for my headline three text. If I come here,  
85:16 - I'll use the headline six textile here for my own 
headline pre text. So I would keep this set Rubik,  
85:26 - this set to medium size set to 20. So I'll keep 
the size set to 20. And for this, I'll keep it  
85:32 - set to medium and outside this to Rubik. Then for 
the letter spacing, it sets 0.15 px. So I would  
85:41 - come here, I would say 0.15 px. And that's going 
to be cool. Then for the headline three bold,  
85:48 - I would have the same sentence there. But 
the only difference as usual will be that  
85:53 - this is going to be a bold text. So I would come 
in here, outside this to rubik cube assets board.  
86:00 - And for the size, I think it's 20 px, and for the 
letter spacing is 0.15 px. So I'll type that in.  
86:09 - And I'll keep this set to 20 Just like this. 
And that's okay. So for the body large text,  
86:15 - come here and use the body one textile 
here, you can see that the size is 16 px,  
86:22 - the width is normal, and the letter spacing is 0.5 
px. So I'd come here, keep this here, I would set  
86:29 - the letter spacing to 0.5 px outsets, the 
weights to regular and outset these to 16. And  
86:39 - out set this to Rubik and that's okay, for the 
body large board, you know what to do already,  
86:45 - how to set this to 16, set these to 0.5 px, 
set this to bold, then set this to Rubik.  
86:54 - And that's it. So I'll go ahead and out, have 
my body small text here. And if I come here and  
87:01 - material design out, use the body to textile here 
material design for that. So I'll keep it set to  
87:07 - normal set the size to 14 and the letter spacing 
to 0.25 px. So I would have this set to 0.25 px,  
87:17 - I'd set this to 14, out set this to Rubik, and 
I'd set this to regular. So I'd have this here.  
87:25 - And this is going to be 14 0.25. And this 
is going to be Rubik. And that's sorted.  
87:33 - Now for the button text. I'll keep this here. If 
you come here, you'd see that the button text here  
87:40 - has a size of 14 px and a letter spacing value of 
1.25 px with a weight that is set to medium. Now,  
87:50 - over here, material design to the button 
text is all in uppercase. But in my case,  
87:55 - I won't have my text stay in uppercase. And 
I think in material design version three,  
88:00 - the button text is not represented in uppercase. 
So I would go ahead and I'd have this set of 14.  
88:08 - And the letter spacing is pretty big. 
So I would have that set to 1.25 px. And  
88:15 - this will be set to medium with the font family 
sets to Rubik. And that's what we have here.  
88:22 - Now for the caption text, it's going to be 
set to 12 px with a letter spacing value  
88:28 - of zero points for PX and a normal weight. 
So I would come here, I'll keep this here.  
88:35 - And now I have this sets regular, this will be 
0.4 px. And this will be set to 12 Just like this.  
88:44 - And the font family will be set Rubik. So this 
is going to be a caption text. So at this stage,  
88:51 - what I'll do is I'll go ahead to save 
all of these styles that I have created  
88:57 - to my style library. And I think we all 
know how to do that by now. So I would  
89:02 - speed this process up, I would select this column 
here, and I would call this headline one out go  
89:10 - ahead fast forward this part of the course and 
come back. So this is it, I have created and saved  
89:17 - the textile that I would need for this project. 
So I would come here and I would rename this frame  
89:24 - typography styles, just for better documentation, 
you know, now when I click on my empty canvas,  
89:30 - you would see that I have all of my saved textiles 
over here. Now let's go ahead and let's create a  
89:36 - color styles out. We'll name this frame to color 
styles. I'd save that now out create my color  
89:44 - styles based on my meat. I want to make use of the 
Material Design Guide to create my color styles.  
89:51 - And that's because you can actually do that. You 
can create your color styles your textiles you  
89:56 - can create any of your styles without using the 
Material Design Guide And you can actually mix it,  
90:02 - you can create your textiles with the Material 
Design Guide and have your color styles created  
90:07 - from your own inspiration. So outcome here, 
I'd like to have a background color here.  
90:13 - So I'll use this my background color, or have a 
text stay at the top here to indicate that this is  
90:20 - for my background color, I would select this text 
and I would make use of one of my saved textiles.  
90:26 - So I'll go with the body large text there. So 
for my background color style, I'd like to use  
90:32 - this color. And that's good. Let's zoom into 
this point. So we can see clearly, and after  
90:38 - having a background color, I'll duplicate this use 
this here, I would love to have a surface color.  
90:44 - And for my surface color, I'd like it to be this 
color here, you can use any color of your choice,  
90:51 - this is my own choice. So I'll duplicate 
this, and have this day here. And this time,  
90:57 - I'd like to have a surface text column, you 
can call this an on surface color, actually.  
91:03 - So I'd like to have a surface text color, which 
is going to be the color that I'll use to write  
91:09 - text on the surface color. So I'd like this to be 
white. Actually, I know this may not be visible.  
91:15 - But I'd like that to be whites just like that. So 
I would duplicate this. Now for us to make this  
91:22 - visible out, select it and add a shadow effect. 
The next color that out heavier, we called the off  
91:28 - text column. And that's my own choice, I'd like 
to have another color for my text. So I would use  
91:34 - this shade for my off text color. And duplicate 
this. And I'd have another color here, which is  
91:42 - going to be my error column. And obviously, 
this is going to be a red color. So I'll use  
91:47 - this shade of red for that, then I'd have this 
here. And I'd like to have a second surface color.  
91:54 - And I'd like that color to be just like this. 
And that's fine. So I have selected all of the  
92:00 - color styles that I would want for this project. 
So I would go ahead and I would save all of these  
92:05 - styles to my style library. And I think we all 
know how to do that. So I would select this column  
92:11 - here. And I'd call that background color, I would 
speed up this process and I would come back to it.  
92:18 - So as you can see, I am done creating and saving 
my color styles. And these are my color styles  
92:24 - here. So that's sorted. The next thing I'd like 
us to do is to go ahead and create the grid style  
92:30 - that we are going to use for this project. So to 
do that, I would use a mobile layout, I would use  
92:36 - the iPhone pattern Promax layout, so I would have 
the iPhone 10 Promax layout here, I would rename  
92:43 - it to mobile grid style out zooming to this point, 
I'll keep it selected, then I'll add a layout grid  
92:51 - property to it, just like that, then I'd have this 
big column grid. Now I have the count before I  
92:59 - would have the margin be 16 out have the gotta be 
16. And for the color out go with something like  
93:08 - this. Now, we are sorted for the column grid. So I 
would go ahead and add a row grid property to it.  
93:16 - I'll keep it selected still come here. Now 
to add another grid property that outset,  
93:23 - as a row grid property, just like this out, 
set the count to 800. And out set the stretch  
93:31 - to center out set the gutter property to zero 
out come here, I will set the height property  
93:38 - to eight. And that's because I want the space 
between the row lines to be eight px, then outcome  
93:45 - here now change the color something like this. 
And that's going to be okay for me. So I would  
93:51 - keep this selected. Come here. And I'll save this 
grid style as my grid style for this project. So  
93:58 - I'll click on style there. And I'll call this 
mobile grid style. You can call it whatever you  
94:04 - want to call it. Now we have three styles saved to 
our style library, we have our textiles, we have  
94:10 - our color styles, and we have agreed styles. So 
I would like for us to go ahead and create shadow  
94:18 - styles for this project. To do that, I would 
come here out have a frame here. Then I would  
94:26 - rename this to shadow styles, when I renamed 
that to shadow Stiles out have some rectangles  
94:33 - right inside that frame. And the rectangle is just 
to display the shadow effects and how it's going  
94:40 - to look like. So I'll keep that selected. I'll 
make the corner radius to have a value of eight.  
94:47 - I'll give it this column. And I'll duplicate 
this and have this here. I'll just have three  
94:54 - shadow effect styles. So I'll keep that there 
and outcome here in material design. Now,  
95:01 - go to the homepage out, click on the Search icon 
there and I'll type in shadow. When I press the  
95:07 - enter key out, have these results show up. So I 
would come here, I would click on this link here,  
95:13 - that's going to take me to material design version 
one, bear out make use of the recommendations that  
95:20 - they have there for creating shadow styles. 
So I would click on that link. Now come here,  
95:26 - and I would use this shadow recommendations that's 
under the sketch section. So I want to go with the  
95:32 - one DP elevation table here, I'll scroll down, 
and I'll make use of the 16 DP elevation table.  
95:39 - So I'll use these values here to create my shadow 
styles. So I'll create a key shadow and an ambient  
95:46 - shadow. Now on that key shadow, you can see that 
we have two types of key shadow styles. We have  
95:51 - the Umbra key shadow style and the penumbra key 
shadow style. So I'll create an ombre key shadow  
95:58 - style first, and for that the Opacity value is 
set to 14. So I would come out keep this selected,  
96:04 - I would add an effect property, and I would set 
the Opacity value here to 14, and the X property  
96:12 - is set to zero with the Y property set to 16. 
So outcome here for the Y property out set this  
96:18 - to 16, the X property has already set to zero. Now 
the block properties 24, and the spread properties  
96:25 - too. So for the block property out, set it to 
24. And for the spread property out set it to.  
96:32 - And here we have our umbrella key shadow effect. 
So I would go ahead and create for the panel,  
96:38 - Brad key shadow effect and the MPs shadow effects. 
So I would speed up this process also, and I'll  
96:44 - come back when I'm done. So these are the shadow 
styles that I have created. So I'll go ahead and  
96:51 - out, save them to my style library, the way to do 
that is pretty easy. Select this rectangle there,  
96:56 - then come here in the Effects section, click 
on that style icon there. And you can call this  
97:02 - whatever you want to call it out call this 
light shadow out cold this other one here,  
97:08 - mid shadow, and out cold this peak shadow and 
that's okay. So far, I have my textiles created,  
97:16 - I have my color styles created, I have my effects 
styles created and I have my grid styles created.  
97:23 - Now at this stage, we are ready to start designing 
the components for our app. So I would like us  
97:30 - to go ahead and start that. So the method I would 
like to use in the designing of our components  
97:38 - will go like this, I'd like for us to design 
our components based on the user task of this  
97:46 - app. Now the first task I'd like us to look at 
is the authentication task. So for this task,  
97:53 - I'd like us to design all of the components 
that will be needed to complete this task.  
97:59 - So let's come up here, let's have a text here, 
I would zoom in to 200. And I would have a  
98:06 - text here, this is going to be the section where I 
would have all of my authentication components. So  
98:13 - I would come here, I would select this textile to 
have that there. So for the authentication task,  
98:19 - we have the login form and the signup form. So for 
the login form, which components do we have there,  
98:25 - we have the input field, and we have the button. 
So I would go ahead to design the input field.  
98:31 - So I would come here, I'll just say, inputs. Now 
this is going to be my placeholder. So I would  
98:37 - come here and I'll use the body small text for 
that. And I would keep it selected, then create  
98:44 - an auto layout on it. Now when I create an auto 
layout, and it out, add the fill color, like this,  
98:50 - then I'll just stretch it to this point. Now 
I'll still keep this auto layout selected,  
98:56 - come here and make sure that the content of the 
auto layout is aligned to the left. And that's  
99:02 - fine. Now for the corner radius property, I would 
give it a corner radius value of eight to have  
99:07 - that now outcome here and I would rename this to 
impute field. Now while this is here, I'll select  
99:16 - the background color for the input field itself, 
then the text here, I'll give it this off text  
99:23 - color here. And I'd like this input field to have 
a stroke color, which is going to be the color of  
99:29 - the off text also. So I can have this. Now this 
is sorted, we are done with creating a imputes  
99:36 - field. This impute field is what we are going to 
reuse for the collection of emails, passwords,  
99:42 - phone numbers, so I'll go ahead keep it selected 
and out, come here and click on Create components.  
99:48 - Now the next thing to create will be our button 
components. So I would come here and I would have  
99:54 - this text here and for that text outcome here now 
to select the button text for that Now I'll keep  
100:01 - the text selected and I'll create an auto layout 
on the text. Now outcome here, for the Button Auto  
100:07 - Layout out, make sure the padding around items 
value is set to 16. Now, same happened for this,  
100:14 - the padding around items value for this input 
field is also 16. So take note of that. Now for  
100:19 - this button components outcome here now give it 
this color, which is the surface color. Now for  
100:26 - the text, their outcome here, and I'll give it the 
surface text color, which is white. Now outcome  
100:32 - here, I would select the button auto layout, come 
here, now align the content of that auto layout  
100:38 - to stay at the center. Still keep it selected, 
come here and give it a corner radius of eight.  
100:43 - And there we have our button components created. 
So I would come here out, rename this to button,  
100:50 - then come here and click on Create components. And 
there we have created our button components. Now  
100:56 - the next component I'd like for us to create here 
under the authentication task will be the input  
101:03 - field, but the users will have to impute their 
verification code in now that input field will  
101:10 - not look like this, it's going to look different. 
So I'd like for us to go ahead and do that. So  
101:16 - I would come here, out of habit text here, let's 
just say zero. And I'll keep the number selected,  
101:22 - then go ahead and create an auto layout on that 
number. Now I'll keep the auto layout I just  
101:28 - created selected, come here and align the content 
of the auto layout to stay at the center of the  
101:34 - auto layout, then I'd come here and add the fill 
color to that auto layout. Now I'd come here, I  
101:39 - would select the pencil. And I'll just draw a line 
horizontally, then I'd click on Done. And this  
101:47 - line I just created here will be grabbed and taken 
into that auto layout that has that number zero.  
101:54 - And you can see that the line is placed here. Now 
what I'll do is this outcome here, inside this  
102:00 - auto layout, now I would select this straight line 
that I created, which is called vector one here,  
102:06 - when I select it, I would come here and now change 
its horizontal resizing value from fixed width to  
102:12 - fill container. So that I can have that now I have 
a problem here, the padding around value for this  
102:17 - auto layout is really big. So I would select the 
auto layout outcome here and I would set it eight.  
102:23 - When I set it to eight, it's going to look 
like this. Now I'd like it to be like this,  
102:28 - because if I am placing these components on my 
screen, I would most likely increase the width.  
102:34 - And as you can see, when I increase the width, 
the number zero just stays the way it is. But  
102:39 - the line itself stretches across the container, 
which is actually what I want. So this is okay,  
102:45 - now, now seems the verification code will be a 
four digit verification code, I like to have this  
102:51 - component go into four places. I'll go ahead and 
do that. So I'll keep this component selected.  
102:58 - And I'll create another auto layout on top of 
it like this. Now this auto layout that I just  
103:03 - created is called prim to out, keep it selected, 
come here and now it sets its direction property  
103:09 - to horizontal direction. When I set that 
to horizontal direction, I would come here  
103:15 - and I would set the padding around items value to 
zero, just like that. Now outcome here now expand  
103:22 - the frame to auto layout. Now just so that I can 
access the frame one Auto Layout inside of it. Now  
103:28 - when I select that frame one Auto Layout inside of 
it, I'll duplicate it. And you can see that I have  
103:33 - duplicated this into four places. Now I'll come 
back here how to select the frame to auto layout,  
103:40 - and how to set the spacing between items value 
to zero, just to have this now let's check to  
103:46 - see if this auto layout itself is a responsive 
auto layout. So I'll keep it selected still an  
103:52 - outcome here and I'll try to expand it. And as 
you can see if I expanded horizontally, the layout  
103:58 - itself is not responding to that expansion. So 
I would Ctrl Z to go back to how we were before.  
104:04 - And at this stage, what I'm going to do is this 
out, select the individual sub Auto Layout inside  
104:11 - this main Auto Layout out select this one, 
which is frame one outcome here now to set its  
104:16 - horizontal resizing value to pill container. And 
I'll do that for all of them just like that. Now  
104:23 - when I select the frame to auto layout now and I 
increase the size horizontally, you will see that  
104:30 - it's all responsive. And that's what I want. So 
I would keep this here, I would rename these two,  
104:37 - verification imputes keep it selected, come here 
and click on Create component and that's sorted.  
104:44 - So at this stage, I'd like for us to go ahead 
and create our authentication screams. So let's  
104:50 - create a section for that. Not a page actually. 
I'd say authentication screams authentication Hi  
104:57 - Fi screens just like this. So I would come here, 
I'd have an iPhone that in Promax screen here,  
105:04 - and I would rename this, make sure you rename 
your layout at this stage. So I would rename  
105:10 - this to splash. And we all know what the splash 
screen is. Yeah, that's the screen you see,  
105:15 - when you launch an app for outcome here, I'll 
change the color of the splash screen to this.  
105:20 - And on the splash screen, I'd like for us to have 
the logo of the brand. And the logo of this brand  
105:25 - is really easy. It's just VXS t, just like that. 
So I would keep the text selected outcome here,  
105:33 - now go with the headline to bold, and I'd work 
with this. So I'll keep that text selected,  
105:40 - come here and align it horizontally and align it 
vertically. And that's okay. So this is our splash  
105:46 - screen. So after the splash screen, the next 
screen to create will be the screen where the user  
105:51 - will have to select the authentication action. 
So I will duplicate the splash screen, I'll  
105:58 - take this out. And I'll change the color of this 
screen now to this, then come here and rename it  
106:05 - of selection. You can call it whatever you want to 
call it. Now over here, out, bring in the button  
106:12 - components out, go to my Assets panel out, 
bring this in and out, align it to the center  
106:17 - horizontally, now expand it to this point. Now 
for me to expand it properly, I would need to  
106:24 - apply my grid style on this layout. So I would 
come here and now apply my mobile grid style here.  
106:31 - So that I can use this as my guide to properly 
expand these buttons. So I'd like the button  
106:37 - to take up two column grids. And that's what 
I have here. So I would come here, I'll change  
106:43 - the text to login. And I would bring in another 
button components here. And I'll change these to  
106:50 - get started. Now outcome here, select this 
button components and change its color to this  
106:57 - just to make a difference. So I would 
keep this here. And I'll keep this here.  
107:01 - And that's fine. So I would select this, 
and now align it to the center vertically.  
107:06 - And I'd bring this in place this Get Started 
button right under this login button. But I'll  
107:12 - use the row grid to ascertain the space value 
out give to that. So I have 1234 rows here,  
107:20 - and it's into four places is 32. So I have a 32 
px bottom margin space between this login button  
107:29 - and the get started button. Now I think the row 
grid is not really visible. So I would come here,  
107:35 - I'd go to my row grid saved style, I'd click 
on Edit style out, select rows and out,  
107:42 - increase the opacity of that color to 20. So this 
is sorted, this cream is sorted. Now if the user  
107:49 - goes ahead to click on the login button here, it 
means the user will go to the login page, right.  
107:55 - So I'll create that now. So let's zoom in. 
Let's take this out. And let's click on layers  
108:02 - and change the name of this frame to log in 
page. And what I'll do is this when I zoom in,  
108:09 - I'll bring this here. So what I'll do is I'll just 
have logo stay here, out, come here now to select  
108:15 - headline to bold, that's too big out GUI headline 
three board, that's okay. So out align it to stay  
108:23 - at the center horizontally, and I'll bring it down 
to this point, then I'll change the color to this.  
108:30 - Now what I'll do next is to have my login form 
created. And I'll do that with my input field  
108:36 - here, which is this. Now I'd like this input field 
to stretch from here to here, just like that.  
108:43 - Now, this input field would have a label here. 
So I'll just give it a label here that says enter  
108:50 - email address. I'll keep label here. Now the space 
between this liberal and this input field is 16 px  
108:57 - have two row spaces between this label text and 
this input field. Now for the input field, I'll  
109:04 - change the placeholder text from inputs to enter 
email address. That's okay. So I would come here,  
109:11 - I'd have another input field here, which is going 
to be used for the password. So I'll change the  
109:18 - placeholder here to enter password. And I'll give 
this input field its own label or duplicate this.  
109:25 - And first of all, I would say okay, the space 
between this input field and this liberal text  
109:32 - should be 1234568 times six is 48. So I'd like a 
48 px margin space between this input field and  
109:44 - this liberal text. So that's sorted. Now I'd like 
a 16 px space between this liberal text and this  
109:52 - impeach field. So I would come here and I'll edit 
this from enter email address and password. That's  
109:59 - okay. let's align this properly. So the next thing 
I'd have here is the login button. So I'll bring  
110:06 - a button component here. And for this button 
components, I'd like to have your margin space  
110:10 - here of that two px. So it's going to be 1234. 
So I'll bring this here, place this there. And  
110:18 - let's zoom out, let's stretch this to this point 
and stretch this to this point, then I'll change  
110:25 - the text of the button to login. Let's see how 
it looks. Okay, this doesn't look really good,  
110:31 - the spacing is not really consistent. So I'll zoom 
out. And I'd have the space between this label  
110:39 - text and this input field to be 32 px, actually, 
so it's going to be 1234. So I'd have that stay  
110:46 - there. And I'd have this stay here. Then I'd have 
123456, which is 48 px. So let's see. Hi, looks.  
110:56 - So this looks okay. Now, I like us to have a text 
here, which is going to be the forgot password.  
111:02 - txt, forgot password. So let's keep this here. And 
let's have that stay 16 px away from this input  
111:10 - field and 16 px away from this button component. 
So I would select the text, and I would make sure  
111:16 - it is a body small text. And that's okay. So I'll 
just zoom out, you can see that we have that. So I  
111:22 - would go ahead and create the signup page for our 
authentication task. So I would come here, I'll  
111:28 - click on layers, and I would rename this to sign 
up page. And if you come here, the only difference  
111:35 - we are going to have here is the fact that we are 
going to have an additional input field to collect  
111:41 - the user's phone number. So this means that I'll 
take this out for now, take this out for now.  
111:47 - And I'd have another placeholder here, which 
is going to have a margin top space of 32 px,  
111:53 - which is 1234. I'll bring this here and out, bring 
in an input field, which is going to stay here,  
112:01 - then out, stretch the input field to this point. 
Now I'll use this second input field to collect  
112:09 - the user's phone number. And I'll change the 
placeholder here to phone number, then I'll use  
112:16 - this thought imputes field to collect the user's 
password, just like that. Now I'll go ahead and  
112:22 - I'll bring in a button here. And this button 
is going to have a 48 px margin top space,  
112:29 - it's going to be 123456. I'll bring this here. And 
I'll change the text here to sign up. So I'll zoom  
112:38 - out, I'll keep this selected out, stretch this to 
this point and out, stretch these to this point.  
112:44 - And that sorted, so we have created a login screen 
and our signup screen. Now when the users click  
112:51 - on the Sign Up button here, the users will be 
taken to that page where they would have to enter  
112:56 - the verification code that was sent to their phone 
number. So we are going to go ahead to create that  
113:03 - page. So I would come here and out rename this 
verification page. And I'll take all of this  
113:09 - out over here. After the logo, I would have a 
rectangle that's going to be that's going to  
113:15 - be this big. I like the rectangle to be 48 px 
tall rectangle, just like this out, zoom out,  
113:23 - or have this here and out, stretch the 
rectangle to this point. And I'd have the  
113:28 - rectangle have this background color. Now on 
this rectangle, I would have a text that says  
113:34 - a verification code has been sent to just like 
that. So I'll keep this text here. And I'll use  
113:42 - a body small text for that, then out align the 
text to the center horizontally, then I'll keep  
113:49 - this text aligned to the horizontal center of the 
page, just as the like this. And that's okay. And  
113:56 - that's okay. So I'll go ahead and bring in 
that input components for the verification  
114:01 - code. But before I do that, let's change the 
color of this text. So I would come here,  
114:07 - and I'll give you this color. Then I'll 
click on the Assets panel now and I'll bring  
114:11 - in this component. Now for this component, I'll 
keep it selected First things first, I'll change  
114:17 - the color of that components out, select the 
individual items inside the components. And now  
114:23 - change these to the background color that we have. 
Just like this. And that's okay. Now for the lines  
114:30 - that we have, I'll change the color of all those 
lines to this. And for the numbers. I'll change  
114:38 - the color of the numbers to this. And that's 
okay. So I would keep this selected. Now increase  
114:44 - the width to this point. So let's zoom in. So now 
we can organize this properly. So I will keep this  
114:50 - here and how to snap the heights. This points just 
like this. So I'd have a placeholder text there.  
114:58 - That's going to say enter very occasion code, 
just like this. And now change the color of  
115:04 - that text to this. So let's go ahead, and let's 
change the color of this label text that we have  
115:10 - here to this, change this to this, come here, 
change this to this and change this to this. Now  
115:20 - for the Enter password text here, I'll change 
this also. And for the Forgot Password text,  
115:26 - I'll change this. And that's okay. Now, let's 
go back to our verification code page. And let's  
115:33 - have this button come up to this point. So it's 
going to be 123456. Out keep this here, and I just  
115:41 - have a verified text, just like that. So at this 
stage, we have created a verification page for our  
115:49 - authentication task. Now when the users click on 
the Verify button, we are going to need a pop up  
115:56 - that would show up on the screen to let the users 
know that their verification has been successful.  
116:02 - Now, how do we create that pop it simple outcome 
here, I would select the frame to now creates a  
116:10 - pop up just like this. Now the reason I'm creating 
this here is so that I can use the width of this  
116:16 - layout to set the width of this pop up. Now the 
definite way to do this is this, if you come here,  
116:22 - and you select this page, you will see that the 
width is 428. Now the margin space on this layout  
116:31 - is 16. Here, and 16 here, which is 32, right, so 
to get the container space here, and use the width  
116:39 - of the container space for this, my pop would be 
me subtracting 32 from 428. So I would just select  
116:48 - this outcome here, I would say four to eight minus 
32. And that's going to be the width for my pop.  
116:56 - And this is it as easy as that. So I would come 
here and I'll give it a corner radius of eight,  
117:02 - then I would go ahead and I'll give it this 
background color, when I give it this background  
117:07 - color, then I'll have a text right inside that 
layout that's going to say, pull number verified,  
117:14 - or whatever you want to say. So I would come here 
and I would select a better textile. For that,  
117:20 - I would go with the body large textile just like 
this out, align it to the center horizontally,  
117:26 - now out bring in the button components here and 
out have a Proceed button here that the user will  
117:32 - click on to go to the homepage. And we are done 
creating this. So I would select this, go to the  
117:39 - Layers tab and out, call this verify popup just 
like that. So that pop up is going to show up when  
117:47 - the user enters their verification code here and 
click on the Verify button. So I'll grab this now.  
117:54 - And I'll place it here. And that's fine. So at 
this stage, I'd like to say that we are done with  
117:59 - creating all of the screens that we need for our 
authentication task. So this is going to take us  
118:05 - to the next task of our app. And that task is 
actually the fund task where users will have  
118:13 - to fund their wallets or their accounts so that 
they can invest. So I would come here, and I'd  
118:20 - have this here. I'll change this to fund accounts. 
So all of the components that are heavier will be  
118:26 - the components that will aid the user to fund 
their accounts on this app. So let's go ahead  
118:34 - and let's do that. Now what you need to take 
note of is this, for a user to fund the account,  
118:40 - the user will have to go to the homepage of the 
app first, right? Because it is from the homepage,  
118:46 - that dude see the fund account button. So what 
does this mean? This means that we need to create  
118:52 - components for the homepage and have our homepage 
sorted first, before we handle different account  
118:59 - routes. So let's go ahead and let's do that. On 
the homepage, the first component that we are  
119:05 - going to have will be a card components that will 
display the balance that we have in our account.  
119:12 - And it is still on that card components that we 
are going to have the one account button. So let's  
119:18 - go ahead and let's create that. So I would have 
a text here is going to say primary accounts,  
119:24 - I would keep that text selected. And I would set 
the typography style to body small boat. Now let's  
119:31 - zoom in to 200. So this is it. Now outcome here 
and I'll create another text, which is going to  
119:37 - be like the account number or the account ID I 
would say this and I'll keep that selected also.  
119:44 - Now I would set this to body small. So now I 
would select both of these, and I'll create  
119:50 - an auto layout on the both of them. Now when 
that auto layout is created out make sure that  
119:55 - the padding around items value is set to zero for 
now. Now outcome here How to select this text and  
120:01 - how to set its horizontal resizing value to fill 
container out, select this here, and how to set  
120:08 - its horizontal resizing value to fill container. 
And for the height outcome here and out sets  
120:15 - the height property here to auto height to 
make it balanced. Now we have this created  
120:21 - to outcome here, I'll add a fill color to this. 
Now, I'll duplicate this, I'll bring this here.  
120:27 - And I'll change this text to account balance, 
or let's just say available balance. Actually,  
120:32 - that's not the account balance, I would say 
available balance, and here I'll write down the  
120:37 - available balance, that's fine. So I'll keep this 
here also. Now, what I'll do is I would select  
120:43 - these two auto layouts, and now add an auto layout 
on the both of them for this new auto layout that  
120:50 - I have created, I would come here and I would set 
the spacing between items value to 24. And out  
120:56 - select this auto layout that inside this new auto 
layout, and how to set its horizontal resizing  
121:02 - value to fill container. And I'll do that for this 
also. Now I would select this new auto layout and  
121:08 - add a fill color of white to it to have this now 
you can see that this is actually responsive.  
121:15 - And that's okay. Now, I'd like to bring in 
a button component and place it inside this  
121:22 - auto layout so that that button will be used for 
the font accounts action. So I would come here  
121:28 - and bring in a button component here, then 
how to select that button component in the  
121:34 - in the design tree here, hold it and grab 
it into this frame seven auto layout,  
121:39 - which is our auto layout. And you can see that 
the button component is placed inside this auto  
121:45 - layout. Now I'd like this button component to 
look different. So I would keep it selected.  
121:50 - Come here and I would set its top padding 
value to eight and its bottom padding value  
121:56 - to eight. So I can have this now change this text 
to font accounts, just like this. And that's okay.  
122:04 - Now I'll go to the feather icons plugin. And I 
look for an icon that out place on the right side  
122:12 - to make the components just look better. 
Let's come in here, let's just type in home.  
122:16 - I'll bring this in actually bring this here 
and replace it here. Now I would select all of  
122:22 - these and I'll create an auto layout on all of 
them. Now a new auto layout called frame eight  
122:28 - has been created. Now inside this frame eight 
auto layout, we have this auto layout here  
122:33 - and this icon. So I would select this auto layout 
now that's inside the frame. It's auto layout. And  
122:40 - now to set the value for its horizontal resizing 
property to fill container. And I'll leave this  
122:47 - set to fixed we know how to select the frame. It's 
Auto Layout now, which is a main Auto Layout now,  
122:54 - and I would come here and I would set the spacing 
between items value to 24. When I do that, I would  
123:00 - come here and add a fill color to this. Now add 
the fill color to the auto layout to have this.  
123:06 - And the final thing I'll do here is to come 
here and set the padding around items value  
123:12 - to 16. When that's done, I'll give it a corner 
radius of eight. To have this now I can expand  
123:18 - this to this point like this. And you can see that 
this component is responsive. And that's that.  
123:24 - So let's go ahead and let's play around with 
the colors of the elements on this component.  
123:30 - So I would select this text here, and I'll give 
it this color, I would select this now give it  
123:37 - this color do same for this and do same for 
this then for this out select the icon itself,  
123:46 - and that's fine. So I would rename this to balance 
card, or whatever you want to call it. I will keep  
123:54 - it selected and now click on Create components. 
And here we have our components created.  
123:59 - So on the home page Still, I'd like to display a 
list of recent transactions that's been carried  
124:06 - out on the app. So let's go ahead and let's 
create a component that's going to serve that  
124:11 - purpose. So I'd come here out create a text out 
call that deposit come here now to select the  
124:20 - body large bold text then I'd come here now create 
another text and I'd have this which is going to  
124:27 - be a dates that deposit happened. So how to select 
these two text and how to create an auto layout on  
124:34 - the both of them. Now how to select this text 
inside the auto layout and how to set its  
124:39 - horizontal resizing value to fuel container. 
Now do that for this also. Now out select  
124:45 - the auto layout and how to set it spacing between 
items value to four. And that's okay. Now for this  
124:53 - deposit text. I'll change the color to this. And 
for the date here. I'll change its color To this,  
125:01 - and that's okay. So I'll keep this here. And 
the next thing I'll do is to have a frame here,  
125:07 - that's going to be 48 by 48. I'll keep it 
selected and out, give it a corner radius of 100.  
125:15 - To make it round, then I'll go to the feather 
icons plug in and out have an icon there,  
125:21 - that signifies incoming, which is 
this, I would select this icon now,  
125:26 - and I'll place it on top of this 48 by 48 px 
frame that I created. When I placed it there,  
125:33 - I would come here now to set its constraints 
value two center for the horizontal axis and  
125:40 - center for the vertical axis. And that's okay. 
Now select this frame, which is now a circle  
125:47 - and out set its color, let's set it to green like 
this. And for the icon, outset, it's colored this  
125:54 - and that's okay. Now for this frame, now that 
I have created, I'll bring you to our PC here,  
126:00 - and how to select all of this and out create an 
auto layout on the both of them. Now for this  
126:06 - new auto layout, I would come here and I would set 
it spacing between items value to 16. And I would  
126:11 - come here now to set its alignments value to the 
center just like this. Now out keep it selected to  
126:19 - come here and add a fill color to it just like 
this. Now I would come here now and I would create  
126:26 - this text. And this text is going to be a 
body large bold text, I would come here and  
126:33 - create another text, which is going to just like 
display the balance out keep that selected and  
126:40 - out make it a caption text, just like this. Now to 
select both of them, create an auto layout on the  
126:46 - both of them and sets the spacing between items 
value to for now to select the text inside the  
126:53 - auto layout now and how to set its horizontal 
resizing value to feel container to have that  
127:00 - and that's sorted. So I'll select this now 
and I'll give it a fill color of white.  
127:05 - Now for the color of the text out set this to 
something lights like this. And this will be  
127:12 - something like that. Now what I'll do is I'll 
select all of these and I'll create an auto layout  
127:18 - on all of them. First things first out align the 
content of the auto layout to stay at the center,  
127:24 - then I'll add a fill color to the auto layout to 
have this now for the spacing between items value  
127:30 - of this new auto layout. Now, I like to set it to 
76. And that's okay. Now for the padding around  
127:37 - items value, I'd like to set this to eight. And 
that's okay. Now let's check to see if this auto  
127:44 - layout is responsive. As you can see, it's not. So 
let's sort that out. And to sort it out is really  
127:51 - easy. I would select this frame here, this auto 
layout here, I would select this auto layout here.  
127:58 - And I'll set its horizontal resizing value to fill 
container. Now when I set this to fill container  
128:05 - out, select the auto layout that's inside it, 
which is frame eight and out set its horizontal  
128:11 - resizing value to fill container also, now I'll 
make sure all of these sets of field container so  
128:17 - I'll select the items to be sure that they are 
also set to feel container. Now when I select  
128:24 - the frame 12 Now, which is our major frame, 
you would see that this is now responsive.  
128:32 - And that's okay, so I'll keep it selected, come 
here and now set the corner radius value to eight.  
128:39 - And I have this I'd like to duplicate this to have 
a withdrawal component where the circle is going  
128:45 - to be red and the icon is going to be different. 
So I would set the position of this icon to let's  
128:52 - set it to 180. That's the angle position. That's 
what I'm setting here. Or you can call it the  
128:59 - rotation property of that icon. So I'm setting it 
to 180 degrees. And I'll change this with roll.  
129:08 - Then you can change all of these details. If you 
want to change them out, select the circle itself,  
129:13 - which is this frame, and I'll change the color 
to this and that's okay. So outcome here out,  
129:20 - select this out, rename this to withdraw our 
card, keep it selected, make it a component,  
129:27 - okay, that's supposed to be deposit card. 
So out select this column here and out,  
129:32 - rename this to deposits card. Keep it selected. 
Come here and click on Create components.  
129:39 - Then select this. Rename this to weave Travel 
Card, keep it selected and make it a component  
129:47 - and that's sorted. Still on the homepage. We 
are going to have a banner that will be used  
129:53 - to copy referral links. So I would go ahead and 
out creates that. So I'd have this text here.  
130:00 - that's going to see invites your friends out, 
keep that selected. And I would go with this  
130:07 - textile here, which is the body large bold 
textile. And I'd have another text here,  
130:13 - that's going to be invite your friends with this 
pack code. And I'll go with the caption textile  
130:20 - here. And that's cool. So I would select this, 
when I select it, I would create an auto layout,  
130:26 - and outcome out sets the spacing between items 
value to eight, then out, select the text items  
130:33 - inside this auto layout and how to set these 
to fill container. And I'll do that for this  
130:39 - also. Now the next thing I'd like to do is to 
have a frame layout here, that's going to be  
130:45 - 48 by 48. And I'll keep it selected still out, 
give it a corner, reduce value of 100, then come  
130:53 - here and give it that color. Now I would go over 
to the feather icons plugin and Outlook one and I  
131:00 - would look for an icon I can use on that. So I 
like to use this icon here, I would select it,  
131:06 - or bring it here and place it on this frame 
layout. Now when I placed there, I would make sure  
131:12 - it's at the center, then I'd come here now to set 
its horizontal constraints value to center and its  
131:19 - vertical constraints value to center. And that's 
okay, now select that icon, then I'll set its  
131:27 - color to this. And that's okay now to select all 
of this creates an auto layout on it. So I would  
131:33 - come here and I would align the contents of that 
auto layout to always stay at the center. Now I'll  
131:39 - keep this auto layout selected, and I'll give it 
a fill color which is going to be the background  
131:44 - color like this. Now, I would select this auto 
layout that is inside this main auto layout. Now  
131:50 - as you can see, it's the brim 12 auto layout that 
has this text, when I select it out, come here,  
131:57 - and I'll set this to fill container. And when I 
select the main auto layout, now you'd see that  
132:03 - this is a responsive auto layout, which means 
we are good to go. Now for the spacing between  
132:09 - items value of this auto layout, I like to set 
it to 24. And for the padding around items value,  
132:16 - I'd like to set it to 16. To have that, then come 
here and set the corner reduce value to eight.  
132:22 - And here we have a component. So I would keep this 
selected. Now rename this to refer our banner,  
132:30 - then come here and click on Create component 
to make it a component. And that's okay. Now on  
132:36 - our homepage, we have one final component, which 
is going to be a very interesting components to  
132:42 - create. And that's going to be the navigation 
components on our homepage, which is going to  
132:46 - be at the bottom. So let's see how we can create 
that components before we put our homepage screen  
132:53 - together. So I would come here and I would get 
the home icon from the feather icons plugin.  
133:00 - I'll type in home there, I'll bring this in. Now 
I'd like to zoom in at this point so that you  
133:05 - can see clearly, when I placed this icon here, 
I would come here and I would create a text.  
133:10 - And I'll call that home. Now for this home text, I 
would create an auto layout on it. And I would set  
133:16 - the padding around items value for that auto 
layout zero, then set its alignment position  
133:22 - to the center. Now select the Home text that 
is inside this auto layout. And now to set its  
133:29 - horizontal resizing value to fill container. 
Now out keep this text auto layout here,  
133:35 - then I would select the Home icon and that text 
auto layout. And I will create an auto layout on  
133:41 - the both of them. Now this auto layout is frame 
15. What I'll do now is I would come here and  
133:47 - I would set the spacing between items value 
for this auto layout to for when I do that,  
133:53 - I would come here now to set the alignments of 
the contents in that auto layout to always be at  
133:59 - the center. Now outcome here and how to select the 
Home auto layout and how to set its horizontally  
134:06 - resizing value to fill container. And that's okay, 
just stretch this and it's going to be sorted.  
134:12 - Now at this stage. What I'll do is this out 
have a frame layout here. That's going to be 48  
134:19 - by 48. And I'll grab this pre empting 
Auto Layout now and I'll place it on  
134:26 - this 48 by 48 px frame layout, make sure it's 
at the center. When I place it at the center,  
134:33 - I would select the frame 16 frame layouts, which 
is our 48 by 40. It's layouts now and I would make  
134:39 - it an auto layout. Now when I make it an auto 
layout, I'll bring it here and I'll rename this  
134:46 - to Home link. Now after I rename it to 
HomeLink outcome here and now set its alignment  
134:53 - to the center so that the content of that auto 
layout will always be at the center. Now the  
134:59 - padding top value is set to three out, set it 
to four, just so that we are going to have even  
135:05 - numbers all around, I would set this to four also, 
and this outset four, and this outsets. Four,  
135:11 - just to have this. So at this stage, what I'd 
like to do now is to have other navigation links.  
135:18 - So I'll keep this home link Auto Layout selected, 
and I'll create another auto layout on top of it.  
135:24 - Now this auto layout that I just created has 
a padding around items value of 16. Yeah,  
135:29 - I'll leave it set to 16. Because actually, that's 
what it's supposed to be now outcome here out,  
135:35 - expand this new auto layout, and how to select 
the Home link or to layout and I'll duplicate it  
135:41 - like this into three places. And that's 
because I want to have just three items  
135:46 - there. Now outcome here, I'll change this from 
home to invest. And I'll change this from home  
135:54 - to transact. Let's select our frame 16. And let's 
add the fill color to it to have this. So if I  
135:59 - expand the frame 16, you'd see that the icon and 
the text is just that it's not responsive. So I'd  
136:06 - like to change that. So to change that out, select 
this home link sets these to fill container,  
136:12 - select this, do that also select this and do that 
also. Now when I select frame 16, and I increase  
136:20 - the width horizontally, you would see that this 
text wrap into the next line is actually fixed.  
136:26 - So for this icons, let's go ahead and let's change 
this icon to a better icon and these two are  
136:32 - better icon. So I would come here, I would go to 
the feather icons plugin. And I would like to have  
136:38 - this icon. So I'll bring this here. And I would 
come in here and I will trace the auto layout that  
136:44 - has that you can see it's still called Home link, 
I'll change that to invest link, when I change it  
136:50 - to invest link, you'd see that to have the home 
icon inside here. So I would come here now,  
136:56 - I would select this bar chart icon now. And I'll 
take it inside the InVEST link auto layout. Now  
137:03 - place it right inside here. And you can see that 
it is here at the bottom. So I would select the  
137:08 - Home icon and out, delete it with the delete key 
on my keyboard, then come here, grab this invest  
137:14 - icon, hold it and take it upwards like this. So 
I'll go ahead and I'll do same for the transact  
137:20 - link here. So I'll keep this selected. Come 
here out, rename this to bottom navigation,  
137:29 - keep it selected and click on Create components 
and that components has been created. So at this  
137:35 - stage, we can go ahead to make use of all of these 
components in designing our homepage. So to design  
137:43 - our homepage, out, come here out, select the frame 
to and I'll bring in an iPhone fatin Promax frame  
137:50 - here. Now zooming to this point, now I would 
select this iPhone 13 Pro Max frame, rename this  
137:58 - to home. When I do that, I would come here and how 
to apply the grid style on it. And when I do that,  
138:05 - let's zoom in to 200. out go ahead and I would 
bring in the menu icon using the feather icons  
138:13 - plugin. So I'll use that one there. Now whenever 
you bring in an icon and you want to place it  
138:19 - into a layout, make sure the icon is inside that 
layout here in the design tree. As you can see,  
138:26 - currently, this icon which is aligned justified 
is not placed inside this layout, which is our  
138:34 - homepage. So what I'll do is I would come here 
in the design tree, click on it to select it,  
138:39 - hold it and drag it into the home layout. And as 
you can see it is now inside the home layout. So  
138:46 - I would come here, and I'll place this here. So I 
would count it row spaces from the top 1234567 and  
138:56 - eight. And that's okay. So I'll have a text here. 
So I can come here and I can say hi and for laka.  
139:04 - Now I'd like to call your attention to something 
important. And that is the fact that as you can  
139:10 - see here, I have the name of the user written 
here, which is N for lucky. Now the question you  
139:17 - should ask is this, how did I arrive at displaying 
the name of the user here when in the signup form,  
139:25 - I did not collect the name of the user. If you 
remember, in my signup form, I only collected the  
139:32 - email address the phone number and the password 
of the user, which means that the app itself does  
139:38 - not have a record of the name of the user. So the 
question you'd ask, which is no malice. How did I  
139:45 - arrive at displaying the name of the user 
here? Now this is going to be your first  
139:50 - assignment in this course, because I'd like you 
to come here in the authentication section here  
139:56 - and refactor the authentication flow here. To 
collect the name of any user that's signing up  
140:04 - to this app. Now I'll leave this open without 
giving you a guide on how to do that. I'd like to  
140:09 - see your thoughts process on how to refactor this 
authentication process with the best experience.  
140:16 - And also with the fact that you would collect the 
name of any user signing up to this application.  
140:24 - If you think coming here and adding another field 
for the name collection is fine, go ahead and do  
140:30 - that. If you have another idea that can make the 
experience better, go ahead and implement that.  
140:37 - Now when you implement the name collection in 
the authentication task here, go ahead tagged me  
140:43 - on social media for my comments. That's your first 
assignment in this course, then I can have another  
140:50 - text here. I'll bring this here. Now the next 
thing I'd like to have here is the balance card.  
140:56 - So I would come here in the Assets panel, and 
I'll bring this component in like this. Now,  
141:01 - I'd like to have four row spaces between this text 
and the balance card. But before I do that, I like  
141:08 - to keep this balance card selected, then come here 
and apply my shadow style that I saved. So it so  
141:15 - I would go with image shadow like this. Now let's 
zoom into this point. And let's make sure we have  
141:20 - four row spaces. And that's okay, let's zoom out. 
Now what we are going to do is to stretch this  
141:27 - to this point. And that's going to be successful 
because our components is a responsive component.  
141:34 - So nothing is going to break. And this is okay. 
So I would come here at the bottom here, out,  
141:39 - snap this to this roll line. And that's sorted. 
So the next thing I'm going to have here is a text  
141:45 - that's going to say recent transactions out, keep 
that selected and out go with a body large bold  
141:51 - text. So I'll make sure I have 1234 Group spaces 
there. And that's sorted. So I'd have that there.  
142:00 - And I would select a different color for that. 
I'll go with this. Now for this also out have  
142:05 - this color set this now just in case I forget to 
set the color of the text as I proceed, you go  
142:11 - ahead and do that. So I would select this icon 
also now change the color to this, that's okay.  
142:17 - Now right on that this will be sent transactions 
text out have those transaction cards there.  
142:24 - So I'll bring this in, which is the opposite cut 
out, give me the shadow style outcome here. I'll  
142:30 - give it a meet shadow style there. Let's zoom out 
to this point. And I'll just stretch this to this  
142:36 - end here. And I'll make sure this snaps properly 
too. And that's not going to be a problem because  
142:41 - a component is responsive. So let's look at the 
space in between this card and this text out  
142:47 - zooming, you can see we have 123 I'll make this 
four. Let's zoom out. Okay, that's actually too  
142:54 - far away. So I'll bring this here, I'll have two 
row spaces. Okay. So I would have this one here.  
143:02 - So I'd have two spaces from this text 
to this card. And if I select the text,  
143:07 - you'd see that I have one row space and two space 
before this card. And that's okay. So what I'll do  
143:14 - now is I would go ahead, I'll duplicate this. And 
when I duplicated, I'd make sure I have just one  
143:20 - row space, which is SPX, I'll bring in this other 
one, which is four, which is for a withdrawal  
143:27 - event. Outcome. Yeah, I'll give it a meet shadow 
out, zoom out and out, snap this to this points.  
143:33 - And I'll make sure it's just eight px space. 
So I'll bring this here and that's okay.  
143:39 - Now I'll have just three recent transactions here. 
So I'll go ahead and bring in this referral banner  
143:46 - and upload it here. So I'll make this snap to 
the end also, just the other point, now zooming,  
143:53 - and I'll make sure I have a consistent space in 
here. So I'll have a 48 px margin space over here,  
143:59 - which is going to be six row spaces, right. So 
I'd have 123456. So I'll bring this in place here.  
144:07 - So I'll zoom out, and at this point, what I'll 
bring in will be a bottom navigation components.  
144:14 - I bring it up let's see here. Let's zoom in 
and let's make sure this is properly placed.  
144:19 - As you can see I have properly placed this so I 
would keep it selected. Come here and I'll change  
144:25 - the fill color to this out select this, change 
the fill color to do this, select this select  
144:32 - this I'll change the fill color to this now select 
the icon itself now change the fill color to this  
144:41 - or do that for this also. And I'll do that for 
this also. Now for the text out select the text  
144:49 - and I'll change the fill color to this and that's 
okay. Now for the text color of this navigation  
144:56 - link. I like the text color actually to be pure 
white so that it can be really present there.  
145:03 - And I think this is better. And that's it. So 
we have just designed our homepage now using the  
145:09 - components that we created. So I would also advise 
that while designing, it's also good most times to  
145:17 - test what you're designing, so I would select 
this column here, and I would click on present  
145:23 - to see how this is going to look like 
actually. So this doesn't look good like this,  
145:27 - I like to present this inside an iPhone 
device. So outcome here, click on prototype,  
145:34 - click on prototype Settings and select a 
device here, which is iPhone 13 products.  
145:39 - When I do that outcome, help select this layout 
once more, and I'll click on present again,  
145:46 - that's going to sort it. And this is what we have, 
this looks good, you can come here and present  
145:52 - this in full screen just like this, to see it 
better. So let's go ahead and let's keep designing  
145:58 - our application. So I'll press the Escape key on 
my keyboard to go out of that full screen display  
146:06 - and not come back here. So the next action I'd 
like to design for will be the action of the  
146:12 - user clicking on different accounts button. So 
when the user clicks on the fund accounts button,  
146:19 - I'd like to display a pop up that will allow the 
user choose the method in which they would like  
146:25 - to fund the account with and that's easy, 
because we have actually created a pop up  
146:31 - before. So I would come here, I'll duplicate 
this pop pop, and I'd have the Pop Pop stay here.  
146:37 - And right inside this pop up here, I would 
have one button here, which is going to say  
146:44 - bank transfer. And I'd have another button here 
that's going to present the option to fund the  
146:51 - account with a debit card. So I'd have this 
the here and now expand this to this point.  
146:58 - Now expand this to this point. I'd also keep this 
here and expand this to this point. Now to expand  
147:04 - this to this point, I'll keep it selected and 
how to center it horizontally. So outcome here,  
147:10 - I'll bring this downwards. And I'd have it 
textured that's going to say select method.  
147:17 - So I'll change the color of that text to this. And 
that's going to be cool. So I would select this  
147:23 - pop now, and I would rename it from verify pop 
to bond method pop up, keep it selected, and I  
147:32 - would make it a component. And that's going to be 
it. So when the users click on bond account here,  
147:38 - they would have this pop pop show up asking them 
to choose the method in which they would like to  
147:43 - fund their account with now let's say the select 
the bank transfer method, they will be taken to  
147:50 - the page where they would have that happen. So for 
that out creates that page now. So I would come  
147:56 - here, I'll duplicate this, and I would rename it 
bank transfer, when I rename it to bank transfer,  
148:04 - I would come here and I would take all 
of these outs. And I would also take  
148:08 - the bottom navigation out also. So what I'd have 
here is an icon that will direct the users back  
148:16 - to the previous page. So I would go to further 
icons. When I come here, I would scroll down,  
148:22 - and I would select this icon for that. So I'll 
take this out. And I'll bring this here. And  
148:27 - as you can see, this icon is not inside this 
layout. That's why this smart guy is not active.  
148:33 - So I would come here, I would select this 
icon and I'll take it into these layouts,  
148:38 - just like this. Now when I select it, and I move 
it around, you'd see that the smart guide is  
148:43 - active. So I'll make sure that I have it spaces 
from the top 12345678. And that's correct. So  
148:52 - I will keep that icon select and I'll change the 
color of the icon vector to this. And that's okay.  
148:58 - The next thing I'd have here is a title for this 
page. That's going to say bank transfer, you can  
149:05 - call it whatever you want to call it. So I'll use 
the headline three bold text for that. I'll keep  
149:11 - that there how to center this horizontally 
actually, to be sure it's at the center  
149:15 - horizontally. And that's fine. Now I'd come here, 
and I'd have bits here. So I would have these  
149:21 - details here. So what I'll do is I'd make sure I 
have 1234. Okay, I'd have it's row spaces there,  
149:30 - I'd have 12345678. So what we are going to have 
here is the destination account details where the  
149:39 - user should make the bank transfer to so here's 
the account number. Here's the account name and  
149:45 - here is the bank name. And that's it. So I would 
come here and I'd have a button component here,  
149:51 - out align it to the center and I would stretch it 
to this point and stretch it to this point also,  
149:57 - I would have 123 456. So I have seven, and eight. 
So I'd have a two row spaces there. Now what I'd  
150:08 - have on this button will be copy account number. 
So the user can just click on this button to copy  
150:15 - the account number here. So I have sorted the 
routes for funding the account on this app with  
150:22 - bank transfer. So let's go ahead and let's create 
the page where the user will use to fund the  
150:28 - account with their debit card. So outcome here, 
so I will change this debit debit card, or align  
150:36 - this to the center, that's okay, I'll take this 
out, then I'd come here, I'll take this out also,  
150:43 - then I'd have all of this here. So I would have 
it row spaces from this icon also. So let's zoom  
150:50 - in so that we can count better. So I would have 
12345678. I'll keep this here. And I'd have one  
151:00 - two, I'll have that there. out, zoom out. So 
this is going to be the page that will enable  
151:06 - the user fund their accounts on this app 
with a debit card. So what we have here is,  
151:12 - the user will enter the amount and have 
the option to select that they want to use  
151:17 - the existing card that they have on this app, or 
they would like to add another card. So let's fix  
151:23 - some alignment issues here. Let's keep this there, 
come here and keep this here also, then come here,  
151:30 - balance that's there. And keep that there. Also, 
I would also come here and make sure that this  
151:36 - is sorted also here. So for the action of adding 
another card, we are going to see how to do that  
151:42 - as we proceed for now let's go ahead and let's 
have a button component here, align that to the  
151:47 - center horizontally, keep that there, keep that 
there, then for the text out, say font accounts.  
151:54 - And that's that. So if the users click on the 
font accounts button, they would have this pop  
152:00 - up show up for them to choose the method they want 
to use, when they select the bank transfer method,  
152:06 - they would have this page show up, 
if they select the debit card method,  
152:10 - they would have this page show up also, they 
would have this page show up. Now, if the user  
152:15 - clicks on this fund accounts button, when they 
want to fund the account with a debit card,  
152:22 - the user will be taken to another page, which 
is going to indicate that the account has been  
152:28 - successfully funded. So I'll duplicate this to 
have that there. Now, before we work on that page,  
152:33 - I'd like to change the name of this page from bank 
transfer to debit card transfer. Now for this page  
152:42 - here, out, rename it to transfer successful. 
Come here, I'll take all of these outs.  
152:50 - I'll take this out also. And I'd have a frame 
here, which is going to be 100 by 100 frame,  
152:57 - that's how it's going to look like that's 
quite small. So I'll make this 240 by 240. And  
153:06 - I'll just work with this. So I'll give it this 
color. And I'll give it a corner radius of 200  
153:12 - to make it a circle. And I'll go over to the 
feather icons plugin. And over here in the  
153:17 - feather icons plug in out bring in this icon, and 
that icon will be placed on top of this frame.  
153:24 - Now go ahead and use the Scale tool to scale that 
icon to this point, just like this. Now, when you  
153:31 - scale the icon, make sure that the constraints 
of that icon is set to the center horizontally  
153:37 - and the center vertically. So I would come here 
now I would select this icon and I'll change  
153:43 - the color of that icon to this when our habit text 
here that would say count funded successfully,  
153:52 - or you can have whichever text you want to have 
they that's fine. So I would come here and I'll  
153:56 - change the color of this to that. So after 
that, I would have a button component here,  
154:02 - that will redirect the user to the InVEST page. So 
I would say invest. Now when they get this page,  
154:10 - they would have the option to click on the InVEST 
button here to go straight to the InVEST page  
154:17 - where they can invest. So that's the next page 
we are going to look at we are going to look at  
154:23 - creating the InVEST page where users can invest 
in stocks. So to create that page, it means that  
154:31 - we need to create the components that the page 
will need. So let's go ahead and let's see how  
154:37 - to create the components for that page. So for 
the InVEST page, the first component I would have  
154:44 - there will be a little card component that will 
be used to display the cash amount that the user  
154:51 - has. So I would come here and I would create that. 
This is the fund accounts component section here.  
154:58 - So I would have the invest component section here. 
And to create that card, I would have this here,  
155:06 - I would say cash. And I'll use the body small 
textile for that. And I'd have an amount here,  
155:13 - just any amounts. Okay, so I would use body large 
bold here, then I'll just select the both of them,  
155:20 - I would create an auto layout on the both of 
them, make sure the padding around items value  
155:26 - is set to zero, then I'll come here and I'll add 
the fill color to it. To have that now select  
155:31 - the cache text and set the horizontal resizing 
value to fill container and do that for this or  
155:39 - that text on the here, which is the amount of 
cash that the user has. Now when that's sorted,  
155:45 - select the auto layout, and then come here and 
set the space in between items value to for now,  
155:52 - I'll go over to the feather icons plug in, and 
I'd look for an icon that I can use to represent  
155:58 - cash there. So I would scroll down and I'll look 
for one of the icons here. So I am going to make  
156:04 - use of this icon here, I would select it, I'll 
bring it here, then I would select both of these  
156:10 - and out create an auto layout on the both of 
them the outcome here. And I would make sure  
156:16 - that the alignment value for this auto layout 
is set to be top left corner of the auto layout.  
156:23 - So I would keep this auto layout selected, I 
would add a fill color to it. And I would set  
156:27 - the spacing between items value to eight, then 
set the padding around items value to eight,  
156:35 - then come here and I'd have the corner radius 
value set it also. So over here, I would select  
156:42 - this auto layout inside the main Auto Layout now. 
And I would set its horizontal resizing value  
156:49 - to feel container. And when I do that, you will 
see that this component will be irresponsive  
156:55 - components just the way I want it to be. Now 
let's go ahead and let's set the colors for this.  
157:00 - So I will set the color of this to that now set 
this to this now for this icon out set the color  
157:08 - of this icon to this. So I'll keep this here, I'll 
duplicate it, when I duplicate it out, go ahead,  
157:15 - change these two assets, then I'll leave the value 
here just like this, or you can change it if you  
157:20 - want to change it. Now the next thing I'd like 
to do is to take out that icon and have another  
157:26 - icon there. So I would go to further icons. 
And I would have this selected for that. So  
157:31 - I'll bring this here, let's go to the Layers tab 
here. And I would select the briefcase icon here,  
157:37 - which is this, I would select it here. And 
I'll take it into the frame 19 Auto Layout,  
157:43 - just like this. And you can see that it is 
staying here on the right side of the auto layout,  
157:47 - I would grab it and I'll take it to the left 
side. Now I'll select this one, and I'll delete  
157:52 - it. And I have that. So I would select this icon 
now and I'll change the color of this icon. And  
157:59 - this is sorted. So I would rename this to cash 
card, whatever you want to call it is okay.  
158:05 - And I would rename this to assets card. And that's 
okay. So I would select this, make it a component,  
158:13 - select this, make it a component. So let's go 
ahead and let's create the other components  
158:18 - that we are going to need on the InVEST page. So 
the next component, our need on the InVEST page  
158:26 - will be an input field component that the user 
can use to search for top stocks that they would  
158:32 - like to invest in. So we have an input field here 
already created, it's already a component. So what  
158:38 - I'm going to do is out duplicate it, I'll bring it 
down here. And I'll keep this here. Now when you  
158:43 - duplicate the components like this, the duplicates 
will be a child components. Now, I wouldn't love  
158:49 - to work with this as a child components. So what 
I'm going to do is out out keep the components  
158:53 - selected, right click on it and out select detach 
instance. Now when I select detach instance,  
159:00 - you would see that this is back to a regular auto 
layout. So I would come here, and I would change  
159:06 - the name to such impute field, then what I'm going 
to do is I would go to further icons now bring in  
159:13 - a search icon, which is this out, grab it and drop 
it inside this auto layout, which is the search  
159:20 - input field auto layout. Now the issue is this. 
I want this search icon to be smaller than this,  
159:26 - because it's quite too big. And as you can see it 
has increased the height of the impute field. So  
159:31 - I'll keep the icon selected. Come here, and I'll 
set this to 12. And I'll set this to 12. And that  
159:38 - I have that now I think 12 is too small outside 
this to 16. And out set this to 16. And that's  
159:44 - sorted. So the next thing is this, I'd like 
this icon to stay on the right side of this  
159:50 - impute field. So how do we do that? Just select 
the search input field auto layout. Come here.  
159:56 - Click on the alignment and padding property. then 
change this property from packed to space between,  
160:04 - and that's going to be sorted. Now let's change 
the color of that icon. I'll change it from black  
160:09 - to this. Now I can select it now and make it a 
component. And as you can see, it can be used  
160:16 - just the way you'd like it to be used. So let's 
go ahead and let's create the next component that  
160:22 - we are going to have on our invest page. So the 
next components will be the components that will  
160:29 - display the list of stocks that are available 
to invest in, in this app. So let's come here,  
160:35 - let's have some space here, I'll use the brand 
fetch plugin. To pull up the logo of a brand,  
160:41 - I'd have this Come here, I'll type in dangoty, or 
press the Enter key on my keyboard. And I'd have  
160:48 - this here. So I would select this out, click on it 
to select it, and I'd have it there in my canvas.  
160:54 - So I'll bring this here, and I'll make it a 24 by 
24 frame logo just like this. Now when I make it  
161:02 - 24 by 24. The next thing I'd love to have is the 
price of this stock, I would have that out select  
161:09 - the caption text for that, then I would have 
this, then I would have this, make sure I use  
161:15 - the caption text for that also, then I'll create 
an auto layout on this and I'll set the padding  
161:20 - around items value to zero. Now out select 
the text inside this auto layout and set its  
161:27 - horizontal resizing value to fuel container. Now, 
I'd like to have an icon here that will indicate  
161:34 - decline or increase. So I would go to the feather 
icons plugin. And I would bring this icon in,  
161:41 - and I place it here. Now I'll make this icon a 
16 by 16 icon just like this, when I plus here,  
161:49 - how to select both of them. Now create an auto 
layout on the both of them. Now for the spacing  
161:55 - between the auto layout, it's going to be set to 
four. Now to select this auto layout that's inside  
162:01 - this framlington Auto Layout, I am talking 
about the auto layout that has this number here,  
162:06 - I would select it, when I select it, outset its 
horizontal resizing value to fill container,  
162:13 - then out select the frame 19 Auto Layout now, and 
now add a fill color to it. Now let's go ahead  
162:19 - and let's select this icon. And let's make the 
color to be green just indicates progress. Yeah,  
162:26 - so I would come here now, I would select both 
of these and create an auto layout on the both  
162:31 - of them. Now for this auto layout here, I would 
set the spacing between items value to eight,  
162:37 - it's already set it for me. So I'll just leave 
it set to eight. Then I'll come here and I'll add  
162:42 - if fill color. To have this outcome here. Out 
select this text now, which is inside this new  
162:49 - auto layout and outset it's horizontal resizing 
value to fill container. And for this outset,  
162:56 - it's horizontal resizing values fill container. 
Now when I select this frame 20 Auto Layout,  
163:02 - as you can see here, it's a frame 20 Auto Layout, 
when I select it, and I resize it, you would see  
163:07 - that it's a responsive auto layout, just like 
this. And that's what I want, actually. So I'll  
163:13 - bring this here. Now I'll go ahead to create a 
text that will signify the title of that stock,  
163:20 - I'll just call it dang. Now I'd come out set this 
to body large bold, and I'd have this day here  
163:26 - with this text. Now what I'll do is I would select 
this and this text, and I'll create an auto layout  
163:33 - on both of them. Now outcome here now add 
the fill color to this auto layout first,  
163:38 - then come here and align the contents of that auto 
layout to the center. After that, I would set the  
163:44 - spacing between items value of that auto layout 
to eight to have this now bring this here and I'd  
163:50 - have this here. The next thing to do is to have 
all of these selected, then out add an auto layout  
163:57 - on all of them. Now for this new auto layout. Now, 
I would set the spacing between items value to  
164:03 - eight, then come here, select this auto layout 
and set its horizontal resizing value to fill  
164:10 - container, then how to select the auto layout now 
and now add a fill color to it to have this now  
164:16 - for the padding around items value, I would set it 
to eight and set the corner radius value to eight,  
164:23 - just like this. Now if I expand this, you'd 
see that I have this component looking just  
164:28 - like this. And this is okay. So I want to select 
it out, name this stock list and out make it a  
164:36 - component. That's fine. Now the next component I'd 
like to have there on the InVEST page will be a  
164:43 - component that will be used to display the list of 
stocks that the user have invested literally the  
164:51 - stock portfolio of the user. So I would come here 
let's zoom in one small out have a 48 by 48 px  
165:00 - frim going out, give it a corner radius of 100 to 
make it around, then I'll give it this color. Now  
165:06 - out, go to the brand fetch plugins, and out, look 
for the paystack logo, which is this. Now outcome  
165:15 - here, I would right click on this paystack logo, I 
like to pick out the background color. So I'll use  
165:21 - the Remove BG plugin. for that. I'll keep the logo 
selected, and I'll make it a 24 by 24 px logo,  
165:29 - just like this, and I'll place it right at 
the center of this circular frame that we have  
165:34 - created. Now when you place that on top of that 
circular frame, make sure to set the constraints  
165:40 - value for the horizontal axis to the center 
and for the vertical axis to the center. So the  
165:46 - next thing to do is to go ahead and I'd say pay 
stack, I'll keep it selected, come here. And I'll  
165:53 - use the body large bold text for that. And right 
under this, paste that text out have plus 345,  
166:00 - just to represent the appreciation value of that 
stock. So I'll keep it selected and outcome here.  
166:07 - And I'll go with the body small text. Now I'd 
make this to have a green color, just like this  
166:12 - and for the paste that text and make it to have 
this color. So I would select both of these,  
166:18 - first of all, create an auto layout, make this 
space in between items value to be set to four,  
166:24 - then out select this text, set it to fill 
container. And for this outset to fill container  
166:30 - also now out expand this, and that's fine. Now 
the next thing to do is to select all of this,  
166:36 - create an auto layout on all of them. When I 
create an auto layout on this outcome, how to set  
166:42 - the spacing between items value to eight, and 
out add the fill color to that to have this  
166:49 - now when I set this to eight outcome here 
and out set the pattern around items value  
166:55 - to eight. Now I'd like for us to check to see 
if this is a responsive auto layout. And as  
167:00 - you can see, it's not and that's because 
I have not set the horizontal resizing  
167:06 - value for this auto layout inside of it to feel 
container. So when I set this to fill container,  
167:12 - and I come here now you'll see that we have 
a responsive layout. So I'll keep it selected  
167:18 - outcome here. Now it sets the corner radius value 
to eight. And then we have our portfolio listing  
167:25 - component. So I would say portfolio portfolio 
list. And I'll click on Create components.  
167:32 - So I think we have created all of the components 
that we are going to need on our invest page. So  
167:38 - at this stage, I'd like for us to go ahead and 
create our invest page. So I would come here now  
167:45 - out, select this out, duplicate it out, 
rename this to invest. And I'd come here  
167:54 - and take all of this out. And now leave the 
bottom navigation components, this time around  
167:59 - outcome here, what I'd have first will be that 
cash card. So I'd have 1234 space before that.  
168:06 - But to see cash card, I'll bring the cash card in 
here. And for this cash card, I'll change the fill  
168:12 - color of this cash card to this out, select this 
and I'll change this also to this, I'll change the  
168:20 - text color here to this. And for this, I'll change 
this to that. So I'll go ahead now. And I'll bring  
168:27 - in the Assets card. And I'll do the same to that 
also come here, I'll change the color of that to  
168:34 - this. And this will be changed to this, change 
this to this and this to this. And that's okay.  
168:44 - So what I'll do now is out arrange all of this 
to stay organized. So I'd like this to take up  
168:50 - two columns. And I'd like this to come here and 
take up two columns. So let's zoom in to be sure  
168:55 - that this is properly organized. So this is not 
properly organized. And that's because I want  
169:01 - four row spaces before this. So I will bring 
this down here. When I select this, I'd have 1234  
169:08 - And this is okay. So I'll bring this here. And 
I'll bring this down here. So this is sorted, we  
169:13 - have this section sorted. So the next section of 
this page will be the section where I would write  
169:19 - a text that's going to say top stocks to invest 
in. So I would have eight row spaces before this.  
169:27 - So I would say 12345678. I don't have this to 
hear. Now for the text here. I'd like this text  
169:36 - to be a body large text, not a body large bold 
text. Now after this text, I'd like to have  
169:43 - that search field. So I would snap this to 
this point. And I would go ahead to bring  
169:49 - in that search impute field which is this and 
I'll just have only an eight px space between  
169:55 - this text here and the input field. So out 
come here stretch these to this point. And  
170:02 - I'll change the placeholder fetch. So let's 
change this from stock to stocks. And that's  
170:09 - fine. So the next component I'd like to have is 
the stock list components. So I'll keep this here,  
170:16 - and actually give it a shadow effect so that we 
can see that clearly. So let's zoom in. So I would  
170:22 - give it two spaces, one, two, and that's fine. So 
out, snap this perfectly. And I would like this  
170:29 - stop here. And I would like this also, to stop 
here. Let's zoom out. So I would duplicate this  
170:35 - and have this house. And let's duplicate this 
here. Let's duplicate this hair also. So let's  
170:42 - zoom in to confirm that all our components are 
aligned perfectly. So you can see this is okay,  
170:47 - this is okay. This is okay. And this is 
okay. So that looks okay, now on have a  
170:54 - stock portfolio section. Now, to differentiate the 
two sections out, bring in the button components,  
171:01 - and I would use it for something different this 
time around. So I would have 1-234-567-8910 1112  
171:12 - spaces. So I'd have 12 Row spaces here, I would 
zoom out, out stretch this to the end like this,  
171:19 - I would come here and align the content of this 
button now to the left, then I would set its top  
171:26 - padding value to eight and the bottom padding 
value to eight. Now what I have here will be  
171:32 - stock portfolio. Now to make this look different, 
I'll keep this selected, come here now to set  
171:37 - the corner reduce value to zero, just like 
this. Now what are we going to have here,  
171:43 - we are going to have the paste back component 
here. So let's zoom in. And let's make sure  
171:48 - this is properly organized. So I'd have 
1234 space before this. And that's okay,  
171:54 - outcome here. Now give it a shadow effect, just 
like this now out, keep this selected, come here,  
171:59 - now change the color. So I would come here, I'll 
change the color to this. So the green color  
172:06 - here needs to actually be thicker than it is now, 
just like this. So I would make this to have two  
172:12 - columns, then I'll duplicate it and have this they 
have also taken up two columns also. Now you can  
172:19 - go ahead and have other stocks listed here. That 
if you want to have that, and here we are, we are  
172:26 - done with our invest page. Now since we won't be 
able to display all of the stock portfolio here,  
172:32 - I would like to have a see all text here. 
So this see all text will be brought in text  
172:38 - out copy here. And I'll duplicate this see all 
text. And I keep you here also, and I'll change  
172:44 - the color of this, see all text or change this 
and that's fine. Now the next flow will be this.  
172:52 - Now let's assume a user likes this talk here and 
the user wants to invest in this talk means the  
173:00 - user will click on the stock and the user will 
be taken to the stock Details page. Right. So  
173:05 - let's make that happen. I'd come here, select this 
page, and I'll duplicate it, come here and change  
173:11 - this to stock details. And that's fine. So for 
the stock Details page, I'll take all of this out  
173:18 - and out zoom in, then go to the feather 
icons plugin to get that icon that signifies  
173:26 - going back to the previous page. And this is it. 
I'll get it. I'll bring it here. And I'll make  
173:32 - sure that this icon is actually inside the stock 
Details page. And I'll take this to this point.  
173:38 - And that's sorted out, select the icon 
vector and I'll change its color to this.  
173:44 - So what do we have here, I like for us to have 
a title here that's going to say stock details.  
173:51 - And this text should have a headline three bold 
textile for it. So I would align it to the center  
173:58 - horizontally. And that's okay, now let's change 
the color this and that's fine. So what I'd have  
174:04 - here will be a component that I would create, I 
would just come here, I would have this frame to  
174:10 - select it and out create a frame 
with it like this out set this eight,  
174:14 - then out sets the colored this van out sets the 
color to this than out go to brand fetch to get  
174:22 - that logo and out place the logo right on that 
frame layouts that I just created. I'll grab it  
174:29 - and upload it here. Now I'd keep it selected and 
outset the horizontal constraints to center and  
174:36 - the vertical constraints to send that and that's 
okay, so what I'll do now is out keep this frame  
174:42 - selected, rename this to stock detail. And then 
I'll come here and I'd make it a component.  
174:50 - So I'll go to that page now. And over here I'd 
have that stock detailed banner components placed.  
174:56 - This is it here. I'd have it stay 
here out stretch it to this point.  
175:00 - and are stretched this this point, 
that's okay. So I would come here now,  
175:05 - let's snap that in. And let's also make sure that 
this is snapped in perfectly, just like this.  
175:11 - So over here I have 123. Let's make it four. 
So over there have four row spaces between this  
175:18 - stock details, text, and this stock detail banner 
components. And that's fine. So let's zoom out.  
175:25 - The next thing I'd have here will be the stock 
price. And the appreciation value, I'll make sure  
175:32 - I have 1234 spaces. That's okay. Now I'll go ahead 
to create a component that outplays here and and  
175:41 - that component will go into more details about 
the stock. So let's go ahead and let's create that  
175:49 - component. So to create that component outcome 
here, and now to select the frame to now create a  
175:58 - frame that's 42 px tall, just like this. Let's 
zoom in to this point. When I create this frame  
176:05 - here, I'll come over here and I'll create a text 
on this frame, I'd say my position, I'll keep this  
176:11 - text here, just like that. And that's fine. Now 
for this text, I'll use the body small textile  
176:18 - that I have here, which is this. And that's okay. 
Now I'll go ahead, I'll create another text here,  
176:26 - I'll actually make this text box to be this 
Why'd not come here, now just type in 35. Now,  
176:33 - I'll keep this text box selected now and align 
the content of that text box to stay at the right  
176:40 - select this frame layout now, and then make it an 
auto layout. Now I would come here and I'll click  
176:46 - on the alignment and padding value, and out sets 
the left padding to 16 and sets the right padding  
176:55 - to 16. Then out set the top padding to 12 and the 
bottom padding to 12. Now I'd like this text to  
177:04 - always stay here and this text to always stay 
here. So I would come here and now change this  
177:10 - from pact to space between. And that's okay. So if 
I come here now, you'd see that if I take this in,  
177:19 - this is always staying here. And this is always 
staying here. Same thing happens if I resize  
177:25 - the left side here, just like this. And that's 
what I want actually. So I'll keep that selected,  
177:33 - then come here. Now I'm select this text 
here to make sure this is set to hog content,  
177:39 - then come here and select this text to make sure 
this is set to fixed width. And that's okay.  
177:47 - So out select this, and out creates an auto layout 
on this auto layout now, just like this, now  
177:55 - this new auto layout is called brim 25. Yeah. So 
inside this new auto layout that I just created,  
178:03 - we have this auto layout here, which is frame 24. 
Out select it and not duplicate it vertically just  
178:10 - like this. Now select the frame 25 Auto Layout, 
then I'll set the space between the items inside  
178:18 - the auto layout for when I do that, I would come 
here and now change the padding around items value  
178:25 - to zero just to have that now I would come here 
and I would set the color for this frame 25 auto  
178:32 - layout to this. Now what I'll do is I would set 
the corner radius value for this auto layout  
178:39 - to eight. Now the corner radius won't be visible. 
And that's because this auto layout here is  
178:45 - staying on top of that auto layout. So I would 
select this auto layout here which is at the top,  
178:51 - and I'll come here, I would click on independent 
corners here. And I'll set the top left corner  
178:57 - reduced value to eight. And now set the 
top right corner reduce value to eight,  
179:03 - just like this outcome here out select this, 
click on Independence corners and outset the  
179:09 - bottom right corner reduce value to eight and 
I'll set the bottom left corner reduce value  
179:15 - to eight. And that's sorted. Now for each of these 
rows here out select this, then come here and I'll  
179:22 - change it horizontal resizing value to fill 
container. I'll do that for this also. Do that  
179:30 - for this also. And do that for this. And that's 
okay. Now let's see if this responding how we  
179:40 - actually wanted to respond. And it is actually 
now let's edit these values that we have here.  
179:46 - So I would come here and how to set this open and 
how to set this to previous close and out set this  
179:55 - to market cap. Now for this I'll 
change the value to So out, come here,  
180:02 - previous close out, say that plus this 
and open, just any value there, actually,  
180:08 - just any value, there will be fine, actually. 
So with this, I have successfully created  
180:13 - these components that allow us to show more 
details about that stock. So I would come here  
180:21 - and not call this detail table. Actually, I would 
call it stock detail table. And I'll save that,  
180:29 - then come here and make it a component. And here 
we have that. So I would zoom out, and I'll go  
180:36 - over to this page, and out, bring that component. 
So let's come here, click on the Assets tab,  
180:43 - come here, grab this and place it here. So out, 
keep it selected, and I'll add a shadow effect,  
180:50 - just like this, then zoom in so that 
I can calculate the row spaces better.  
180:57 - So from this item here, I would like to 
have 123 and four row spaces people this,  
181:05 - let's zoom out, and let's stretch this to this 
point. And that's fine. So I can go ahead, select  
181:12 - this text, so that I'll be able to change the 
colors out, select all of this, come here and  
181:20 - change this. To that good, this was not selected. 
So I would change that. For this also out,  
181:28 - change it. Now the next component I'd like to have 
here will serve as links just in case the user  
181:36 - wishes to read more about the stock and the 
company that owns the stock. So I'll go ahead,  
181:44 - and I'll have that it's going to be similar to 
what we have here. Now this is me creating this  
181:50 - just the same way I created this stock portfolio 
components here. The only difference here is that  
181:57 - I just changed the color from what I have 
here to this. So let's zoom in to be sure  
182:04 - that we are placing our items properly. So 
outcome here, I would have 1234 Row spaces  
182:13 - before this. And that's okay. So at the bottom 
here, I'd have a button component just for a user  
182:21 - who is satisfied with what they see here on 
this stock Details page. And this button is  
182:28 - going to be an invest button. So out zooming to 
calculate the space better. So I have 123456 Row  
182:40 - spaces here. And I would like to stop at the sixth 
rule space. And that's it. So if a user likes what  
182:49 - they see here, on the stock Details page, the 
user can go ahead and click on the InVEST button.  
182:57 - If the user is not satisfied, the user 
can come here and click on this button  
183:02 - to go back to the previous page where the 
user will still have to see all the stocks  
183:08 - listed here. So that's it. So the next page 
here will be the page that the user will go to,  
183:16 - when the user clicks on this invest button 
here, I'd like us to go ahead and create  
183:22 - that page. So I would duplicate this. So outcome 
here, I would rename this to enter stock, amount,  
183:33 - whatever you want to call it is okay. 
So outcome here, I'll change this to  
183:37 - enter amount. And that's cool. So I'll go ahead 
and I'll have this here. Now this is me using  
183:45 - an input field and a button as simple as that. 
So I will zoom in to this point and out calculate  
183:51 - the space better, I would select this item 
and out calculates the space from that item,  
183:57 - I would say 123456. So I'd like six rule spaces 
there. So I would select this. And I'll make sure  
184:06 - that snaps perfectly. And that's it. Now the space 
between this input field and this button is 1234.  
184:15 - And that's fine. How to come here. Now check out 
this invest button. And this page is sorted. Now  
184:22 - when the user enters the amount that the user 
wishes to invest in the stock with, the user  
184:29 - will go ahead and click on this Proceed button. 
Now when the user clicks on this Proceed button,  
184:36 - the user will be taken to another page. Now that 
page will be where the user will be presented  
184:43 - with a summary of the investment that 
the user is about make. Now outcome here.  
184:50 - I would select this and out duplicate it 
and out. Rename this to investments summary.  
184:58 - Now I'll zoom in outcome here. And now take 
all of these out. And I'd have this here.  
185:05 - Now this is going to be a summary of the 
investment that the user is about to make. And  
185:12 - if the user is okay with the summary that the user 
sees here, then the user would go ahead and enter  
185:19 - their secrets been here, before they click on 
the InVEST button to finally make the investment.  
185:27 - So outcome here out, select all of these, and out 
calculate the row space is better. So I would come  
185:34 - here, I would keep this here, I would make sure 
that I have lead zoomin, I'd make sure that I have  
185:40 - 123456 Row spaces there. And that's cool. So out, 
zoom out to this point, and this page is sorted.  
185:51 - So this is the flow so far. Now when the user 
is on the homepage here, and the user wants to  
185:58 - invest, the user will click on this invest link 
at the bottom navigation here. This is it here at  
186:06 - the bottom navigation here. When the user clicks 
on this link, the user will be taken to the InVEST  
186:12 - page, which is this. And if the user goes through 
the list of stocks that we have here, and the user  
186:20 - is interested in investing in one of these stocks, 
let's say this one here, the user will go ahead to  
186:26 - click on it. And when the user clicks on it, the 
user will be taken to the stock Details page here,  
186:33 - which is this. Now when the user is taken to this 
page, the user will read about the stock. If the  
186:40 - user likes what the user sees here, the user will 
go ahead and click on the InVEST button here. When  
186:47 - the user does that, the user will be taken to this 
page, where the user will have to enter the amount  
186:54 - that the user wishes to invest in that stock with. 
Now, when the user enters the amount here, the  
187:01 - user will click on the Proceed button here. When 
the user does that, then the user will be taken  
187:08 - to this page where the user will see a summary of 
the investments that the user is about to make.  
187:15 - Then if the user is okay with this, the user 
will go ahead to enter their secrets pin here.  
187:21 - When the user does that, the user will click on 
the InVEST button here for the investments to be  
187:28 - made successfully. So before we proceed further, 
I'd like to come here and change this to summary.  
187:35 - So I would keep that selected and align it to the 
center horizontally, I'd also come here, select  
187:42 - these and make sure it's aligned to the center 
horizontally. Now, I'll come to this page, which  
187:49 - is the Invest page. And I'd like to have a title 
here, I'll change this to invest an hour, align it  
187:58 - to the center horizontally, just like that. Now, 
when the user clicks on this invest button here,  
188:06 - the user will see a page that says investment 
successfully made or investment made or whatever,  
188:13 - whatever just a success message. So I would come 
here, I would select this, and I'll duplicate it,  
188:19 - and I would rename this successful investments. 
And I'd save that. So what I'm going to have here  
188:27 - will be similar to what I have here. So what I'll 
do is out, take out all that I have here on this  
188:33 - page, I'll take this out. Also, I was supposed 
to take this out also this debit card title here,  
188:42 - I'll take that out. Also, I'll just select all of 
this out, duplicate it. And I bring this in here,  
188:48 - just like this. And I'll zoom in. And I'll just 
change this to success. I'll keep it selected  
188:55 - and out, align it to the center horizontally. 
Now I'd come here, I'd say go back home. And  
189:03 - that's it. That's sorted. So so far. So so 
far, we have achieved the authentication  
189:11 - task, we have achieved the funding task, and 
we have achieved the investment task. Now we  
189:19 - are going to go ahead to create more screens that 
will actually make the user experience on this app  
189:26 - to be better. So one of those screens will be the 
Transaction Details page. And that's the page that  
189:35 - the user will go to when the user clicks on any 
of this card here under the recent transactions  
189:42 - section. So if the user clicks on this card, 
for example, the user will be taken to a page  
189:48 - where the user will see the full details of this 
transaction. So let's go ahead and let's create  
189:56 - that page. So outcome here out select this one 
here, and I'll duplicate it. And I have that.  
190:03 - So let's keep it selected, come here. And let's 
call this transaction details. And for the  
190:10 - Transaction Details page, I'll take this out. And 
I'll take this out. Now this is what I would have  
190:17 - on this transaction details page. This is it's 
as simple as this. So first things, first,  
190:23 - let's calculate our row space to be 
sure that it's perfectly set. So I'll  
190:29 - have this here and out Count 123456. So 
I like this to start here 123456 Out,  
190:39 - snap this correctly, and out snap this correctly. 
And that's okay. So this here is to display  
190:47 - the transaction date that that transaction 
happened. So this is not complete, actually,  
190:54 - I can give some space here and say 1603, just like 
that, so that we will depict the date and time of  
191:04 - the transaction. And that's cool. Now, what 
we have here is the transaction amount. And  
191:10 - here we have the amount in words, here we have 
the transaction type, which is a withdrawal,  
191:16 - here we have the transaction remark, which is for 
Netflix, and the status of that transaction is  
191:24 - successful. So I would select all of this zoom 
in. And I would make sure I have 1234 photo  
191:32 - spaces there. Now for the button components 
here, how to select this, and I'll make sure I  
191:38 - have 123456, I'll make sure I have six row spaces 
there. And that's fine. So if a user comes here,  
191:48 - and the user clicks on one of these transactions, 
the user will go to a transaction details page,  
191:55 - where the user will see more details about that 
transaction. So I'll go ahead and out create  
192:02 - other pages, that's going to make the experience 
on this app to be better. Now, before we do that,  
192:09 - I'd like to give this transaction details page, a 
page title. So out, duplicate this, and I'll bring  
192:16 - you here a lot call that transaction details 
out, align it to the center horizontally,  
192:22 - just like this. And that's fine. So the next 
flow that I'd like to design will be the flow  
192:29 - that the user will go to when the user clicks on 
this menu icon here. Now when the user clicks on  
192:37 - this menu icon, I'd like for a menu bar to slide 
in with other options that the user can use to  
192:45 - improve their experience on this app. So how do we 
make that happen? It simply, so outcome here, I'd  
192:53 - have an iPhone 13 Promax, here, out, rename this 
to manage slide bar, and out, keep it selected,  
193:01 - come here, and I would divide the width by two, 
just like this. And I'd have this. So I might  
193:08 - decide to go ahead and increase this further. And 
what I'll do is this outcome here, I'll just have  
193:14 - the logo here. And I would go ahead to have list 
items of menu links. So the first menu link, I  
193:22 - would have here will be recent transactions. I'll 
keep that selected here. And I'll change this to  
193:30 - a body small text just like this. Now let's zoom 
in. Let's keep this here. I'll keep it selected,  
193:36 - and I would create an auto layout on that text. 
Now this auto layout, I would like the auto layout  
193:43 - to have a padding around items value of 16. And 
I'd also like the alignment value to be set to the  
193:51 - left. So I would come here now I would keep this 
then creates another auto layout on top of it.  
193:57 - Now this new auto layout that I have created 
will have a padding around items value of zero,  
194:03 - just like this. Now outcome here out expand 
this new auto layout here in the design tree.  
194:10 - When I do that out, select the recent transactions 
auto layout, and I'll duplicate it just like this.  
194:18 - Now go ahead to edit all of these two other links. 
Before I do that, let's select the main Auto  
194:25 - Layout now, which is frame 34. Here, and let's set 
the spacing between items value two, four, just  
194:32 - to have that. So the next link here will be card 
management, I'd have this be investment portfolio.  
194:42 - I would have this be request statement. And I'd 
have this be settings and that's fine. But I would  
194:50 - come here I would select all of these text. 
And I'll change the color to this. And that's  
194:57 - what we have. So whenever the user clicks on On 
this menu icon, this is going to slide out from  
195:04 - the left. And that's okay. So let's go ahead to 
create the routes that the users will go to when  
195:11 - the users click on this transact link here at the 
bottom navigation section. So to do that, I would  
195:18 - come here, I would select this here, and I will 
duplicate it. I would rename that to transact,  
195:27 - without zooming out, come here. And I would say, 
transact. Keep that selected and out, align that  
195:34 - to the center horizontally, then 
I'll take all of these outs. Now,  
195:39 - I'd like to have two card components here, one for 
withdrawal action, and one for a deposit action,  
195:46 - as simple as that. So let's go ahead and let's 
create those card components. So outcome here out,  
195:53 - create a text here, I'll just say deposits. And 
I'll keep this text selected. Come here, and I'll  
196:00 - go with the headline three bold text, just like 
this. Now, I'd come here and I'd have a 48 by 48  
196:09 - px frame layout, with a corner reduce of 100, 
then I'd come here and I'll give it a color,  
196:16 - that's green, then go to be further icon 
slogan. And I'll get an incoming icon there,  
196:24 - which is this, this is our incoming arrow icon 
out, place this here, then come here and set  
196:31 - the constraints value to center and center. 
Now out, select the icon vector, and now change  
196:38 - the color to this. So I would bring this here, 
select this, and then create an auto layout on it.  
196:45 - Now for this auto layout, I would come here 
and I'd set the alignment property to center.  
196:52 - When I do that, I'd come here and outset the space 
in between items value to 16, then go ahead to add  
197:00 - a fill color. When I add the fill color out, come 
here and I'll set the padding around items value  
197:07 - to eight. To have that then I would go ahead to 
set the corner reduce value to eight. Now outcome  
197:14 - here now select the deposit text and change the 
horizontal resizing value from hog content to fill  
197:23 - container. So this is the deposit action card 
that I would have on that page. outcome here,  
197:30 - I would rename this to deposit action, save that, 
and then come here and click on Create components.  
197:38 - Now select this text and I'll change the color to 
this. Now I would come here now I would go to this  
197:45 - page. And I would bring in VAT components. This 
is it. I'll keep it selected. And I'll give it a  
197:52 - shadow effect out zoom into this point. I'll bring 
this here. And I'd make sure I have 123456 Row  
198:00 - spaces. And that's okay. So out stretch this to 
this point like this. And I'll create a component  
198:08 - or withdrawal. I'll duplicate this component, 
which is the master component, take notes. And I  
198:15 - would detach instance, when I detach instance out, 
select the circular frame there out, make this red  
198:23 - out, select the arrow frame there, and I 
would set the rotation value to 180 degrees.  
198:31 - And that's sorted, as easy as that. So I would 
come here select it's come here and go to the  
198:37 - design three and rename this to withdraw action. 
When I do that, I'll keep it selected. And I'll  
198:44 - click on Create components here. And that's 
okay. So outcome here now, I'll bring this in  
198:51 - give it a shadow effect, like this, I would 
have this day here. And I would spread this  
198:57 - to this point. And that's okay. So finally, on 
this page, I would love to have a button here  
199:04 - that can be used to perform the adding of card 
action. So I would keep this here I'd have 16 px  
199:12 - margin space here, which is to row spaces. 
One and two are keep the bottom selected.  
199:19 - out, set the top padding value to eight and the 
bottom padding value to eight. Then I'll change  
199:26 - the text contents there to add card just like 
that. And that's sorted. So this is the page  
199:33 - that the users will go to when the users click on 
this transact link here at the bottom Navigation  
199:41 - component. So this is where I would stop for 
this project in regards to creating screens  
199:48 - and outs stop here because we have achieved the 
actual user task for this app. Now I'd like you  
199:55 - to take this as your own assignments and and when 
you are done. You can Tagami tweets on Twitter,  
200:01 - my Twitter handle is you can go ahead and 
tag me to your assignment on Twitter. Now,  
200:08 - the assignment is this, I'd like you to have a 
notifications icon here. And the notification icon  
200:18 - should take users to a page of notifications 
when they click on it. And the notifications  
200:25 - can be anything. It can be newsletters, it can 
be transaction notifications, it can be anything  
200:30 - at all. Now place the notification icon here and 
create a Notifications page that users will go to  
200:38 - when the user clicks on the notification icon. 
Now, after that, come here and create a route  
200:46 - or create a page that the user will go to when 
the user select add another card, create a page  
200:53 - that the user can use to add their debit card 
details to this app. The third assignment  
201:01 - will be this, come here and create a page that 
the user can use to request for their statement.  
201:09 - After that, create a settings page now on this 
settings page, lets the user be able to set  
201:16 - their secrets been there. Now over here, which is 
the card management link, the user should be able  
201:23 - to delete a card that they have added to this 
app, or add another card that they want to add  
201:30 - to this app. So that should be possible when the 
user clicks on card management here. This should  
201:36 - take the user to a page where they will be able 
to see all the cards that they have on this app.  
201:42 - And and also, they should have the ability on 
that page to add and delete cards. Now take notes,  
201:49 - this Add Card button here should take the 
user to the same page that you would create  
201:55 - for this add another card here, just like 
that. And also, this recent transactions  
202:01 - link here should take the users to a dedicated 
page for the list of all recent transactions.  
202:09 - This investment portfolio link here should 
take the user to a dedicated page of all  
202:16 - the investments that the user has made on this 
app. So go ahead to build all of those pages,  
202:24 - so that you can have a full and complete user 
experience. Now, finally, for the assignment,  
202:31 - just before I forget, come here and create 
a Forgot Password page, create a page here  
202:38 - that the user can use to reset their password 
just in case the user forgets their password.  
202:45 - And that's going to be it. So at this stage, what 
we are going to do is to create a prototype of all  
202:50 - of these designs that we have created, we are 
going to link this perfectly and see how it's  
202:56 - going to work. So to do that, let's zoom in out 
come here, I will start from the splash screen. So  
203:04 - I would select it. Come here click on prototype. 
When I click on prototype, I would come here and I  
203:10 - would connect the splash screen to this page. Now 
the action will be an on tap action. And that's  
203:17 - because this is a mobile app actually. So we are 
actually supposed to tap this screen with our  
203:22 - fingers. Now when the user taps on the screen, 
the user should move to or should navigate to,  
203:29 - you can see the action here should navigate 
to the author selection page, which is this.  
203:36 - Now the transition animation or the navigation 
animation should be a smart animation. So it's  
203:43 - going to be an ease in animation. And I would like 
this ease in animation to be for 800 milliseconds.  
203:52 - Actually, I'd like this to be an ease in and out 
animation, just like this. Yeah, that's better for  
203:58 - me. So outcome here now. And I will say okay, when 
the user clicks on the login button here, the user  
204:05 - should go to the login page. And I'll keep all of 
the sets the way it is. Now when the user clicks  
204:10 - on the get started button here, the user should 
go to the signup page. So I would come here,  
204:16 - click on this login button here. And I would say 
when the user clicks on that login button after  
204:22 - after passing in their email address and password, 
the user should go to the homepage, which is this  
204:30 - over here. When the user clicks on the 
signup button, the user should go to the  
204:35 - verification page where the user will have 
to enter the verification code sent to their  
204:42 - phone numbers. Now when the user types in the 
verification code here, the user should click on  
204:49 - the Verify button. And when the user clicks on 
the Verify button, this should show like a pop up  
204:56 - so I would connect it to this. So out connect this 
And I'd keep it as on top, then for the action  
205:03 - out habit set to open overlay, then come here 
and I'll keep it sets a centered actually,  
205:10 - after setting these two Centered Outcome here, and 
I won't select this option. And that's because I  
205:17 - don't want the user to close the pop up. If 
they mistakenly click outside the pop, I'd  
205:23 - like the user to click on proceed here. So this 
other option here out selected, this is the add  
205:30 - background behind overlay property or 
the add background behind overlay option.  
205:36 - When I select it, it means that when the popup 
shows up, the background will be faded. So I  
205:42 - would set the Opacity value to 35%. And I would 
like the animation to be an instant animation.  
205:51 - And that's going to be okay. Now, when the 
user clicks on this Proceed button, the user  
205:57 - should be taken to the homepage. Now, when you are 
creating a prototype like this, you can just take  
206:03 - the connection here to any page at all, then come 
here and set it to the page you want to set it to.  
206:09 - So I would come here and I would select Home. And 
you can see that the connection has gone to the  
206:14 - homepage, just like this. So the authentication 
is set. Now when the users come to the homepage,  
206:21 - and the users click on this menu icon, the user 
should be taken to the menu, slide bar them here,  
206:28 - this is what should show up when the user 
clicks on that menu icon. Now, I would want that  
206:35 - menu slide bar or that slide bar menu to 
actually slide in from the left. So I'll click on  
206:42 - this connection here to have the Interaction 
Details page show up. Now for the action here,  
206:48 - I would set these to open overlay outcome here and 
I'll set it to manual. When I set it to manual,  
206:54 - it means I'll be the one to set how the 
interaction is going to happen. So I'll grab this,  
207:00 - and I'll place this here, just like this. This is 
how it's going to look like when you click on that  
207:06 - menu icon. Now outcome here. And I would say close 
this slide by menu, when the user clicks outside  
207:15 - of it, I would select that and over here out have 
a background behind overlay properties selected,  
207:21 - also an out have the Opacity value set to 35%. 
Now for the animation, I'll change this from  
207:29 - instance, to move in just like this. And for 
the moving action out habits moving from the  
207:36 - left and out have the speed of that animation 
set to 800 milliseconds. Now outcome here,  
207:44 - I'll click on this font Account button here. And 
I'd say okay, when a user clicks on this button,  
207:50 - this should show us a pop up. So we all know how 
to set a pop up, right. So I'll change this to  
207:57 - open overlay. Keep it set centered, and out add 
a background behind overlay action. And also, if  
208:05 - the user chooses not to fund the account anymore, 
the user can just click outside the pop up and go  
208:12 - back to the homepage. So I would select that. I'll 
keep this set to 35%. And for the animation here,  
208:20 - I'll keep it set instance. So I'll close this. 
Now if the user selects the bank transfer option,  
208:28 - the user should come here, as easy as that. 
And if the user clicks on copy account number,  
208:35 - this account number will be copied to the user's 
clipboard. And when that happens, the user will  
208:40 - come here and click on this arrow here to go 
back to the homepage out sets this from instant  
208:48 - to smart animates. And that's okay. So if the 
user clicks on the debit card option here,  
208:55 - the user would be taken to this page. If the user 
is taken to this page, and the user types in the  
209:02 - amounts that they are trying to actually fund 
the account with, then the user will go ahead to  
209:08 - tap or to click on the fund account button here. 
And when the user does that, the user would come  
209:15 - to this page where the user will have a message 
that says account funded successfully. Now,  
209:22 - at this stage, we are going to want the user to go 
directly to the InVEST page. So I'll select this  
209:29 - button now. And I'll take this flow to the InVEST 
page, which is this. So when the user gets here,  
209:36 - I'll take this menu icon out here actually, 
when the user gets here, and the user wants  
209:42 - to invest in one of these listed stocks, let's 
say this one, the user will click on it and the  
209:48 - user will be taken to the stock Details page. 
When the user gets to the stock Details page and  
209:55 - the user is okay with all of these details here. 
The user will click On the InVEST button here.  
210:02 - And when the user does that, the user will come 
here and be required to enter the amounts that  
210:10 - they wish to invest in that stocks with. When the 
user enters the amount and the user clicks on the  
210:17 - Proceed button, the user will be taken to this 
page, which is where the user will see a summary  
210:23 - of the investment that the user is about to make. 
Now, if the user is satisfied with this summary,  
210:30 - the user will go ahead to type in their secrets 
pin here, and then click on this invest button.  
210:37 - And when the user does that, the user will be 
taken to this page, which is a success page,  
210:44 - that's going to let the user know that, hey, you 
have successfully invested in that stock. So the  
210:51 - user will come here and click on the Go back home 
button, and out, take this back to the homepage,  
210:58 - how to select home here. So let's come here, let's 
see the other links that we have not created. So  
211:05 - let's say the US is trying to see the transaction 
detail of any of this recent transaction. Yeah,  
211:12 - let's see the withdrawal transaction here, I 
would click on it to select it. And I would  
211:18 - link this to the Transaction Details page, which 
is this. So if the user clicks on that transaction  
211:26 - card, there, the user will be taken to this page. 
And if the user goes through the whole detail,  
211:32 - and the user is satisfied, when the user clicks 
on done, the user will go back to the homepage,  
211:39 - outcome here and select home here. Same will 
happen if the user comes here, clicks on that  
211:45 - arrow, the user will go back to the home page. 
So you can see that we are creating lots of  
211:51 - connections and flows here. Lots of connections 
and flows here. So let's go back to the homepage,  
211:57 - and let's see the flow that we have not created. 
So this is the home page here. So this home link  
212:03 - here is safe to be there. Now let's say the user 
clicks on this invest link here, which is in the  
212:10 - bottom navigation components, the user should 
be taken to the InVEST page. If the user clicks  
212:16 - on this transact link here, the user should be 
taken to the transact page. So if I come here,  
212:23 - now out still connect this, this should go to the 
homepage. And since this is the Invest page here,  
212:31 - it means we are here. So this should go to 
the transact page. I'll do that for this also.  
212:38 - So let's come here. Let's see, let's see what 
we have not connected yet. So if the user comes  
212:44 - to the transact page, and the user clicks on the 
deposits card here, the user should have that pop  
212:53 - up, show up, that would require them to select if 
they want to deposit with bank transfer or their  
213:01 - debit card, it should be the same flow. Now over 
here, I should actually change this to withdraw.  
213:08 - If the user clicks on this withdraw card 
here, the user should be taken to a page  
213:13 - where they would have to enter the amount and the 
destination bank that they are trying to withdraw  
213:19 - their funds to. So this is also going 
to be a part of your assignment.  
213:24 - Go ahead and create that flow. When you create 
it. Go ahead and tag me on Twitter for my comment.  
213:31 - So let's go ahead and let's present this flow. 
And let's see how it's going to look like.  
213:36 - So I would come here, I would select the splash 
screen. And I'd come here and click on present.  
213:45 - So when I click on present, I would have the 
splash screen show up here. When I click on it,  
213:51 - I would have the option to either login or get 
started. So I'll click on get started. And here we  
213:58 - are on the signup form page. So if the user enters 
their email address, phone number and password  
214:04 - when the user clicks on the signup button, the 
user will be required to enter the verification  
214:11 - code. When the user enters that the user will 
click on the Verify button here. And a pop up will  
214:18 - show up here saying phone number verified. Now 
you'll see that when I click outside the pop up,  
214:24 - the pop up won't go away until I come here and 
I click on the Proceed button. When I do that,  
214:31 - I'll be taken to the homepage. Now here we are in 
the homepage. Now if I come here and I click on  
214:37 - this menu icon here, you will see that this menu 
slide bar or this slide bar menu and how you call  
214:43 - it is fine. This slide by menu slides in from the 
left. When I click outside of it, it goes back in.  
214:51 - Now let's check the font accounts flow. When I 
click on it, I would have this pop up show up here  
214:58 - that says Select method. Now let's say I choose 
to select the bank transfer method, I would have  
215:04 - this show up here, I'd be able to copy the account 
number. And when I'm done, I would come here and I  
215:11 - would click on this arrow icon here. To go back to 
the homepage. Now let's click on the bond Account  
215:18 - button once more, and let's select the debit 
card method, you can see that I'll be taken to  
215:24 - this page where I would have to enter the amount 
that I'm trying to fund this account with. Now,  
215:29 - let's say I type in the amount, I would come 
here and I'll click on the fund account button,  
215:36 - just like this. And I'd have this message that 
says accounts funded successfully. Now if I go  
215:43 - ahead and click on this invest button, I'll 
be taken to the InVEST page, which is this.  
215:50 - And over here, I would see a list of stocks. Now 
I'd like to present this in full screen actually,  
215:56 - so that we can see better. So over here, I 
would see a list of stocks that I can invest in.  
216:02 - Now let's say I'd like to invest in this one here, 
I would click on it. And I would see full details  
216:08 - about this stock here. Now, I don't have some of 
my components showing here. So I would go back to  
216:16 - my design outcome here. So this is the stock 
Details page. So this three buttons actually  
216:24 - not inside that layout. So I would select 
the three of them. And I'll take them inside  
216:30 - that layout. And that sorted. Now when I come back 
here, you will see that I have that here. So let's  
216:36 - go back to our full screen presentation. So if the 
user likes what they see here in the stock Details  
216:43 - page, the user will go ahead to click on the 
InVEST button here. And when the user does that,  
216:50 - the user will enter the amount that they would 
like to invest in that stocks with. When the user  
216:57 - does that, the user will go ahead to click on the 
Proceed button here. Now that flow is not created.  
217:06 - So I would come back to our design here, 
I would click on this Proceed button here,  
217:10 - click on prototype. And now let's see what the 
problem is. So I came here and I clicked on this  
217:16 - connection link here. And I changed this from 
on drag to on top. Now when I come back here,  
217:24 - and I click on the Proceed button here, you 
will see that we are taken to the Summary page.  
217:30 - Now this page will be the page where the user 
will see a summary of the investments that  
217:36 - the user is about to make. And if the user is OK 
with this, the user will go ahead to enter their  
217:42 - secrets pin here and then click on the InVEST 
button. Now the InVEST button is not active also  
217:50 - outcome here and out see the problem for that. So 
I would click on invest here. And I would select  
217:56 - the connection flow here. And as you can see here, 
there is an undo drag event here, outcome here.  
218:03 - And I'll delete that on drag event here. And I'll 
just leave this set to tap now. But the tap event,  
218:11 - there is no navigation destination. So I would 
set this. First of all out to take note of the  
218:17 - screen here. This is the successful investment 
page. So I would come here and I would go to the  
218:23 - successful investment page. And that's sorted. 
Now when I come here, and I click on invest,  
218:30 - I'd be taken to the success page. 
Now when I click on Go back home,  
218:35 - I'll be taken back to the homepage. Now that is 
after I have successfully invested in a stock.  
218:43 - Now, what happens if I come here, and I click 
on one of the recent transactions here, let's  
218:49 - say the withdrawal transaction here, you would see 
that I'll be taken to the transaction details page  
218:56 - for that transaction. When I'm done going 
through it out, click on Done. And I'll be  
219:01 - taken back to the homepage. Now what's going to 
happen if I come here and I click on this invest  
219:06 - link at the bottom navigation components. I'll be 
taken to the InVEST page still. And I'd be able  
219:13 - to still invest in a stock just like this. 
Now what happens if I come here and I click on  
219:20 - the transact link here or be taken to this page 
where I'd have the option to deposit funds or  
219:26 - withdraw funds. And I'd also have the option to 
Add Card. Now if I am okay with this outcome here,  
219:33 - and I'll click on this arrow to go back to 
the homepage and that arrow is not active.  
219:40 - So I would have that sorted out come here 
and connect that arrow to be homepage  
219:48 - and it's going to be an on tap event. So when I 
come back here, when I click on that arrow now,  
219:54 - you will see that I'm taken back to the homepage.
