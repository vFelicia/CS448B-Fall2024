00:00 - in this video we're going to talk about
00:02 - the concept of a loop don't be
00:04 - intimidated if you don't understand
00:05 - everything that I've written down that's
00:07 - okay the concept of a loop is that it's
00:09 - a way to Traverse a set of data what
00:12 - that means is say you have an array like
00:14 - this one ver array which is true a
00:16 - Boolean wiie a string 42 and zero if we
00:20 - want to go through all of these I wrote
00:22 - a loop here this is a four loop again
00:24 - you don't have to know what this means
00:26 - exactly what I've written here basically
00:29 - means that it go through every single
00:31 - one of these and every time there's an
00:33 - entry it will add one to my counter it
00:36 - could get a lot more complicated than
00:38 - this and it does and that's okay what
00:40 - you need to know about loops is if you
00:41 - have a set of data that you want to
00:43 - access every single one of the things
00:45 - inside of it but you don't want to write
00:46 - the code that many times that's when you
00:49 - use a loop
