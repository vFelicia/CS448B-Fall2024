00:05 - hey everybody it's
00:07 - Jesse sorry uh it started a little bit
00:10 - late I had um I guess I'm only 3 minutes
00:13 - late it's not as bad as I thought uh I
00:16 - had a um a problem with something I had
00:21 - made months ago and now uh
00:25 - basically um we we were using this
00:28 - plugin with Salesforce to let people
00:30 - register for events to come visit campus
00:34 - and the default styles were just really
00:36 - really
00:37 - outdated um even like to look at the
00:40 - code they were using versions of like
00:43 - JavaScript plugins that were like 10
00:45 - years old it it was really bad so I went
00:48 - in and did the best I could in
00:49 - customizing it and bringing it up to
00:52 - like our brand
00:54 - standards so um it turns out that on May
00:59 - 15
01:00 - 15 all of everything I had done wasn't
01:03 - working anymore and it it reverted back
01:05 - to the default the only reason I know
01:07 - that is because part of what I did was
01:09 - add Google analytics
01:10 - code uh so that's the point when the
01:13 - analytics stopped coming in for those
01:15 - pages uh and I I had never gone on
01:19 - because they had been working well for
01:21 - at that point weeks at least weeks and
01:24 - um tested it everything was
01:26 - fine so didn't realize until today that
01:30 - it wasn't working
01:31 - so I was trying to figure that out at
01:35 - The Point when I realized that I I don't
01:38 - know what's going on uh then I I needed
01:41 - to send an email and get it forwarded on
01:43 - to the company we have an odd setup
01:45 - right now so we we're using a Salesforce
01:50 - product to take
01:52 - applications uh for people who want to
01:55 - go to our University and for for other
01:58 - things but we're using a product that's
02:00 - being resold by another company and
02:03 - they're all all they are doing is just
02:06 - taking this Salesforce plugin so that
02:09 - basically there's like two other
02:11 - companies between us and Salesforce so I
02:13 - can't go directly to Salesforce for
02:16 - support and I can't go to the company
02:19 - that made the
02:20 - plugin we have to first go to this
02:23 - company that's reselling the plug-in so
02:26 - it's really complicated and I have no
02:28 - direct contact with any uh uh any people
02:31 - that can that can help me out so I have
02:33 - to go to my it Department first then
02:36 - they go to one of the companies and that
02:39 - company will Pro maybe have to go to the
02:42 - company that made the plugin it's just a
02:44 - big mess so
02:45 - anyway uh that's that's why I was
02:49 - delayed so again I
02:51 - apologize uh
02:55 - so uh let me I want to check and see if
02:58 - we how many people we have in here now
03:01 - uh see if we can get started Okay cool
03:03 - so we we have a decent number around 50
03:05 - people uh so so let's get started I
03:11 - um uh let me start out I haven't given
03:14 - my normal uh starting thing so I know
03:16 - there have been a lot of new people from
03:18 - the live chat so just to let everyone
03:20 - know this this stream is just me doing
03:23 - my everyday work uh I I am employed
03:26 - full-time as a front-end developer uh so
03:29 - this is me doing my work so it's not
03:31 - exactly a tutorial although hopefully
03:33 - you learn how to do some things when you
03:35 - watch this uh and it is very much
03:37 - interactive so I take advice from you
03:39 - all in the live chat and also pool
03:41 - requests for the projects uh of which
03:43 - I've had a lot recently which is awesome
03:45 - thank you um I do make a lot of mistakes
03:50 - and that's intended because uh I really
03:52 - want you all to see what it's really
03:54 - like for me to do this so I don't
03:55 - rehearse any of it beforehand and uh I
03:58 - just want to give you a glimpse into
03:59 - what it's like for me to do front-end
04:02 - development uh I I don't know if I'm
04:06 - like the average developer or not I'm
04:07 - not really sure how well my day uh
04:09 - relates to other developers but at least
04:11 - it might give you an idea of what one
04:13 - developer does all right so having
04:17 - having said all
04:19 - that um let me uh fill you in on what's
04:23 - been done since yesterday and what we're
04:25 - going to do today so basically
04:30 - let me
04:32 - get this was
04:35 - for a little es6 exercise I was doing so
04:39 - I can get rid of that these are some
04:41 - resources I was reading over uh that
04:43 - Kevin sent yesterday in the live stream
04:45 - in the live
04:46 - chat
04:49 - um let me show
04:52 - you okay so we've added we've added some
04:56 - things for testing uh in order to test
04:58 - the upload things
05:00 - so no one will ever see this unless
05:03 - you're submitting pool requests or
05:04 - anything but uh it's just going to allow
05:07 - us to do testing on the uh file upload
05:11 - uh input that we
05:13 - have and what else is happened a lot of
05:17 - refactoring has gone
05:19 - on and all this stuff was from pool
05:21 - requests so I had some pool requests
05:23 - from uh Patrick and some from Kevin and
05:28 - uh basically just refact
05:30 - factoring the service request
05:35 - page uh so you can see there's a big
05:39 - difference so I'm not going to go over
05:40 - it all uh for two reasons one uh it'll
05:44 - take up a lot of time because so much
05:45 - has changed and also the second reason
05:48 - is I know that it works because I tested
05:50 - it but I'm still trying to figure it out
05:52 - myself so I don't want to try to stumble
05:54 - through
05:56 - um explaining what's going on here when
05:59 - and uh I I wouldn't be able to do a good
06:02 - job of explaining everything maybe if I
06:04 - broke it down into small pieces but but
06:07 - for right now basically what it does is
06:10 - uh you could see the labels for the
06:13 - input elements are now here okay so
06:16 - everything's
06:17 - in uh in state now really uh so the
06:22 - labels are here for all our multi-line
06:24 - Fields so really I mean you this is
06:27 - somewhat self-explanatory so our single
06:30 - line text Fields labels here multi-line
06:32 - labels here labels for our checkboxes
06:34 - here and we have two columns of
06:37 - checkboxes so they're split up into two
06:39 - columns right
06:40 - now uh and
06:43 - then we had um basically we were trying
06:47 - to make these controlled components so I
06:50 - had done it on maybe one of the
06:52 - components one or maybe a few of them
06:55 - yesterday uh just to start out with and
06:58 - uh Patrick went in and actually made it
07:00 - so that it applies to all of the
07:02 - components but it happens
07:05 - like without having to manually go to
07:07 - each component and do it right so that's
07:09 - what what this whole thing is doing is
07:11 - just making sure that the value of each
07:14 - component is determined by the
07:17 - state uh the the the state in uh for
07:22 - that particular
07:24 - element uh let me show you it's going to
07:27 - be a lot easier if I just show you this
07:29 - in uh Dev tool so you can see what the
07:31 - state is so let me do
07:34 - this uh some things are just hard to
07:37 - explain without a
07:40 - visual okay so let me bring this
07:44 - over so you can see the result of what
07:47 - all that
07:48 - does
07:50 - so this is the state now for that
07:53 - service request component so you can see
07:56 - each
07:58 - field has its
08:01 - own uh key in state and the value in
08:04 - state is going to be the value that
08:06 - shows up in the field so uh for instance
08:10 - I could go in here and change the state
08:12 - for
08:14 - name to just some nonsense here and it's
08:18 - actually changed it here in the field uh
08:22 - I could add something in for the phone
08:24 - number and you could see it changed the
08:26 - state here so what happens is
08:30 - on
08:31 - change and if you watch yesterday you
08:33 - know like I went over this yesterday but
08:36 - uh just to to reiterate for anybody
08:38 - who's new on change it changes first the
08:43 - state and then once a state change
08:46 - occurs that triggers the rerender and
08:49 - then the
08:50 - value comes from the state so that's the
08:53 - flow of of how this works so why would
08:56 - we want to do this um it makes it really
08:59 - easy for us to get all the values uh to
09:03 - keep track of everything
09:06 - so this will make more sense once we
09:08 - start sending this data
09:10 - somewhere I'm sure that this is not the
09:12 - only way to do it uh
09:18 - but I like this way to do it this seems
09:20 - to be common among people when I I've
09:23 - seen them do this uh this kind of thing
09:25 - like in tutorials for react so uh so
09:29 - anyway I'm just saying I'm not it's not
09:30 - like we're inventing anything new here
09:32 - uh but could be a little bit more
09:35 - complex than you're used to if you
09:36 - haven't done forms in react
09:39 - before all right so that's that's
09:41 - basically what's happened like I said a
09:43 - lot of the other stuff was uh for the
09:47 - testing um so you'll see that like when
09:49 - we go to commit some code you'll see the
09:51 - test
09:58 - run okay okay uh
10:01 - also I have the uh live stream going on
10:06 - Instagram as well simultaneously so if
10:08 - anybody's interested in seeing that it's
10:11 - uh it's just a shot of me in my office
10:14 - uh working
10:16 - so uh it won't really add that much uh
10:19 - to the actual coding part of it but it's
10:21 - there if you want
10:24 - it uh okay so let me check the live chat
10:27 - and just say say hi and see what's going
10:38 - on okay cool it looks like thank thank
10:41 - you everyone in the live chat it looks
10:42 - like there are some some new people who
10:44 - had some questions and you all took care
10:46 - of that uh for me and gave some great
10:48 - answers so I appreciate that I
10:50 - definitely want to make sure that
10:51 - newcomers to uh this stream always feel
10:54 - very welcome and you all in the live
10:56 - chat do a great job of that so thank you
10:58 - for that and uh and keep up the good
11:15 - work okay great I'm looking through it
11:17 - looks like you all took care of every
11:19 - question uh wow you you you uh you all
11:22 - are
11:26 - awesome yes John so John Hansen said
11:28 - save the Save State I guess is much
11:31 - better than the old Ajax stringify yes
11:33 - exactly yeah that's what that's what I
11:35 - was thinking of when I was saying like
11:37 - if you haven't done this in react the
11:39 - other way I was thinking of is well you
11:42 - probably used something with Ajax and
11:44 - and submitted like
11:50 - that okay Sebastian see you later uh
11:53 - Sebastian is frequently in the the live
11:55 - chat and helps out with a lot of pool
11:56 - requests and things and uh he's working
11:59 - security and Music Festival this week so
12:01 - he can't be here so he uh good luck with
12:05 - with that and uh hopefully there's
12:08 - nothing serious you have to deal with
12:10 - and you can just enjoy the
12:20 - music okay uh let's see
12:24 - Pablo Pablo's here you commented on a
12:28 - video I saw the comment but that was
12:31 - like kind of right in the middle when
12:32 - all the craziness was happening that I
12:34 - explained earlier and why I started late
12:37 - let me think oh you were asking about
12:39 - the Udacity course okay so I want to
12:42 - give you an answer to that the Udacity
12:44 - course is paid the the react Nano degree
12:47 - from Udacity is the course that I was
12:49 - referring to it is a paid course it is a
12:52 - little bit expensive they had a sale on
12:54 - it but I think the sale's over but um if
12:57 - you're looking for free resources right
12:59 - now I don't think Udacity has any free
13:01 - react resources they have a lot of other
13:03 - free things that are useful but not
13:05 - react uh so if you want free react stuff
13:09 - um code academy has a has a class for
13:13 - free that's browser based and um let me
13:17 - think learn code academy has some
13:19 - YouTube videos on
13:21 - it uh the beta curriculum for free code
13:25 - Camp I think uses react more I'm going
13:27 - to be honest I haven't checked out the
13:29 - beta curriculum in a really really long
13:31 - time so uh not sure what's in there but
13:34 - I'm I think there's react stuff in there
13:37 - so those would be my go-to places right
13:39 - now if you're trying to learn react and
13:42 - uh don't really want to invest that much
13:43 - money which I totally understand uh if
13:46 - you weren't sure that you're actually
13:47 - going to use it that much then it's
13:49 - definitely not worth uh the
13:53 - investment okay let's um oh cool it
13:58 - looks like um there are some other
14:00 - suggestions coming up in the live chat
14:02 - as well so thank you all for
14:04 - contributing uh we're going to have to
14:07 - make I I definitely need to make like
14:10 - some sort of video and just bring
14:12 - together all of your suggestions that
14:14 - because there's been a lot of good
14:15 - suggestions for react resources so uh I
14:18 - need we need one place where I can just
14:20 - direct people to because I think I
14:22 - frequently forget good resources when I
14:25 - try to answer that question uh during
14:27 - the the Stream so I'll have to record a
14:31 - good answer to that so everybody gets
14:34 - quality answer uh and it's not depending
14:37 - upon my
14:44 - memory all right so today
14:47 - um all right I'm going to leave it up to
14:50 - you all what you want me to do today
14:52 - because I have basically two
14:54 - things what I was hoping to try to do uh
14:59 - yesterday what we kind of started is
15:01 - handle all this form data and actually
15:03 - send it somewhere now I want to maybe
15:05 - set up that somewhere and that would end
15:08 - up being uh probably I would use express
15:11 - and node.js
15:13 - to take that data and do some stuff with
15:16 - it that's going to be kind of difficult
15:18 - okay that's not an easy task um at least
15:22 - not for me because I don't often do it
15:25 - uh so I have done it before but only
15:29 - once before so uh we can try that or we
15:34 - can try to do something that's a little
15:35 - bit more beginner friendly and just
15:37 - build some of the layout for the rest of
15:38 - the pages uh and I will say for me today
15:43 - I've just been feeling really like not
15:45 - not motivated and kind kind of down I
15:48 - don't know what's wrong with me today so
15:51 - if you all want to put in the chat what
15:52 - you feel like doing I'll do whatever you
15:54 - want but me like my mind right now is
15:57 - saying do the easy stuff today uh but I
16:02 - don't want to trust my mind when I'm in
16:04 - this like depressed state uh
16:07 - because I'm I'm sure that we can
16:09 - accomplish a lot of stuff even if we do
16:11 - the hard stuff uh so I'll give everyone
16:14 - a minute just to uh weigh in with their
16:16 - opinions on what you'd like to see today
16:19 - uh which like I said either way is fine
16:21 - with me um it might actually be useful
16:25 - if there's a lot of beginners to maybe
16:26 - do some of the easier stuff and it'll
16:28 - give me I don't know more time to
16:31 - research uh what I want to do for the
16:34 - um uh the handling of file uploads and
16:39 - data uh actually let
16:43 - me I've never done this before on air
16:45 - but I I feel like I just I really need
16:47 - to to give you a quality stream today so
16:50 - um I know you all can't see this right
16:52 - now you might hear some of it so
16:54 - normally I get some caffeine in before
16:56 - the stream but because I had crazy going
16:59 - on right before the stream I couldn't so
17:02 - I'm going to mix up my energy drink
17:05 - right now it'll just take me uh just a
17:08 - minute and then I'll have it uh normally
17:13 - I I do this in advance
17:18 - so just just do a little bit I don't I
17:21 - don't need a lot I got a decent amount
17:23 - of sleep um but I ended up so yesterday
17:27 - I told you I think I was going to go to
17:28 - to see a doctor about my wrist so I
17:31 - ended up spending most of yesterday
17:34 - evening uh with the doctor well not
17:38 - really with the doctor in the waiting
17:39 - room waiting for the doctor and uh the
17:42 - good news is my wrist is not broken
17:44 - which is what they uh suspected uh that
17:47 - it might be broken um but it's not it's
17:51 - not broken but it is uh very inflamed
17:55 - so I uh I have a brace so so I I'm going
17:59 - to show it on the uh Stream So I have
18:01 - this brace and uh if you if you're
18:03 - joining in in uh Instagram you can see
18:06 - it and right now the brace is off
18:08 - because I tried to use the brace earlier
18:11 - and work with the brace and it actually
18:13 - hurt worse so it was really hard to try
18:17 - to move my hand around uh I used like
18:20 - the uh the magic uh trackpad thing for
18:24 - the iMac and it was it was crazy and to
18:27 - try to type with it was really weird I
18:29 - kept making mistakes uh so I took it off
18:33 - so that's probably not the best thing
18:35 - for it but I don't I don't have time
18:38 - like I got to do I got to code this
18:40 - stuff so I I can't I can't mess around
18:43 - with uh trying to use that brace so I'll
18:46 - put on the brace maybe like later on it
18:50 - does help a lot when I'm home uh because
18:53 - I keep forgetting uh it's my right hand
18:55 - and I'm right-handed I just keep
18:56 - forgetting and doing stuff and then
18:59 - hurting it
19:00 - worse so
19:03 - anyway just an update in case you
19:07 - uh you wondered about it which I think
19:10 - most people probably care about the code
19:12 - and not necessarily about what I'm doing
19:14 - but sometimes if I don't give you a
19:16 - update somebody always asks me uh about
19:20 - the update
19:27 - so so cool so I think that's Phillip is
19:32 - that Phillip in the uh in Instagram so
19:35 - Phillip thinks that that is a cool nerdy
19:37 - brace
19:39 - so
19:42 - yeah so hopefully uh they gave me these
19:45 - these pills that are supposed to bring
19:47 - the inflammation down uh but it it's
19:49 - probably going to take a couple of days
19:51 - so hopefully they work
20:00 - okay so sorry for the delay but at this
20:05 - point I think I should have enough
20:08 - responses uh to determine what we should
20:10 - do
20:19 - today all right so let me scroll up okay
20:22 - I think this is the point where I asked
20:24 - in the live chat
20:29 - [Music]
20:34 - and let's see okay so we got to vote for
20:37 - easy
20:38 - stuff okay uh bobic asks why are you
20:41 - depressed I don't know why I'm depressed
20:43 - and that's why I don't think I should
20:44 - trust it
20:46 - so I have like I have depression so I
20:50 - see a counselor for it I take medicine
20:52 - for it right so what I've found and I've
20:55 - had it
20:57 - for I don't know
21:00 - over 10 maybe like 15 years or something
21:03 - so at this point I realized that if I
21:06 - feel like I'm depressed and I think
21:08 - about reasons why I maybe should or
21:10 - shouldn't be depressed and I can't think
21:12 - of any good reason why I should be
21:14 - depressed then I should not trust those
21:16 - feelings and I should try to get over it
21:19 - uh however I can so
21:21 - today I don't really think there's a
21:24 - really good reason for me to be
21:25 - depressed there is some stuff going on
21:28 - like some family stuff uh that is is
21:32 - kind of I think well basic I think my
21:34 - wife's uh grandmother is probably going
21:35 - to die really soon so that's like a
21:38 - little bit sad
21:41 - uh I don't want to I don't want to
21:43 - downplay that but I'm just saying
21:46 - like that's something that is definitely
21:49 - legitimate to be sad about but to be sad
21:52 - to the point where like I don't want to
21:53 - do my work I just don't think that that
21:56 - connects like if anything I should be
21:58 - doing more work to just take my mind off
22:00 - it um and cuz really like I
22:03 - don't uh I'd rather be able to be there
22:05 - for my wife and not have to have her
22:07 - worry about me being depressed or
22:09 - anything so anyway that's bottom line uh
22:13 - answer to the question is there's not
22:14 - really a great reason why I should be
22:16 - this depressed today so that's why I'm
22:18 - trying to get over it so I've got my my
22:21 - gfuel energy drink and I've got my live
22:23 - stream and I've got you all which always
22:25 - pumps me
22:27 - up so I think we'll be
22:30 - okay so don't worry about me it's not
22:32 - like severe depression or
22:53 - anything okay so I think the only vote I
22:56 - got one way or another for doing
22:58 - something was do was easy
23:04 - stuff maybe I'm I missed it but that's
23:08 - fine with me we can do easy stuff yeah
23:10 - so Brian voted for easy stuff okay Dixie
23:14 - easy stuff Conrad beginner stuff okay
23:17 - awesome let's do that then uh that's
23:20 - cool I kind of wanted to research a
23:21 - little bit more um and I had some
23:25 - resources up on my other screen that I
23:27 - still hadn't read all the way through
23:28 - yet so uh it'll probably it'll end up
23:31 - being a better stream when we do that uh
23:33 - then I'll I'll make less mistakes and
23:37 - um we we actually we'll probably get it
23:39 - working uh in instead of just making
23:42 - something that keeps
23:45 - breaking uh
23:48 - okay cool thank you all for uh for your
23:51 - input on that I appreciate that and
23:52 - thanks for for giving me a break today
23:55 - uh and uh voting for the easy stuff
24:03 - uh bobic asked do you exercise regularly
24:07 - um not not like I should so I actually
24:09 - got back into exercising so two of the
24:13 - last three days I uh I exercised in the
24:16 - morning uh before coming to work for
24:19 - about like a half hour 45 minutes I just
24:21 - did some
24:22 - cardio uh today though this morning I
24:24 - didn't I woke up a little bit late and
24:27 - um I I didn't exercise so I'm guessing
24:31 - like that probably has something to do
24:32 - with it I I normally feel better when I
24:35 - exercise and that's what actually my
24:37 - counselor says I'm supposed to exercise
24:39 - like pretty much every day for 45
24:41 - minutes
24:43 - so that explains why I'm probably
24:45 - feeling depressed cuz I haven't I've
24:47 - just been so busy it's that's something
24:49 - that's easy to cut out you know there's
24:51 - other things that I like I have to take
24:53 - care of the kids I have to come to work
24:55 - uh and the one thing that I can just cut
24:58 - out and nobody's going to get upset
25:00 - about is
25:04 - exercise all right cool so uh bobic I
25:08 - really appreciate that um bobic says uh
25:12 - notices that that it definitely helps
25:14 - with state of mind uh for exercise so I
25:17 - appreciate you um taking an interest in
25:20 - me and and giving me advice on
25:23 - that um okay let's get
25:26 - started so uh I really I do appreciate
25:30 - you all caring about my my mental health
25:33 - uh but I'm sure there's some people in
25:34 - here that came for some code so let's
25:36 - get let's get to the
25:38 - code and let's see what page we're going
25:41 - to do so we've done
25:43 - home uh logos we didn't do anything yet
25:46 - for Logos this is just um the demo card
25:50 - uh that road had made the card component
25:55 - um so I don't think we're going to do
25:57 - logos today we'll see if that's the last
25:59 - thing left over we have posters okay
26:02 - posters is fine
26:05 - letterhead is f Share story service
26:08 - request from
26:09 - tutorial
26:12 - H actually the tutorial is going to be
26:15 - really easy let's just start with that
26:17 - let's get a quick win right off the bat
26:19 - and uh set up the tutorial view so uh
26:23 - I'll start as as we've been doing and
26:25 - I'll show you what we currently have on
26:27 - the site basically what we're going to
26:29 - try to imitate uh and uh possibly
26:32 - improve upon if we
26:34 - can so the goal um we we spoke about
26:39 - this a few streams ago but the goal
26:41 - basically is to to make this as close as
26:45 - possible to what it is now just so that
26:47 - people don't get freaked out by it and
26:48 - they still know what to do but improve
26:50 - where we can improve uh so the changes
26:54 - to the UI are going to be minor but
26:56 - hopefully meaningful and in a good good
26:58 - way for our
27:02 - users all right so here's the tutorial
27:05 - look look how simple this is uh all I
27:07 - had was a card uh with a bit of text at
27:10 - the
27:11 - top and yeah that is really my work
27:13 - phone number so I don't care if you all
27:15 - see that you can get it online
27:19 - anyway
27:22 - um so it's just a YouTube video of me
27:25 - clicking around and explaining to people
27:27 - how to use this
27:29 - so that's all we really need to do uh
27:31 - we're just going to put it in here uh
27:34 - now the the one UI change that we have
27:36 - been thinking about and testing on some
27:38 - pages is to not use cards quite so much
27:42 - and I think in this case we can
27:44 - definitely get rid of this card because
27:45 - we have kind of this double card Effect
27:47 - going on here because we have shadows
27:50 - right now uh on the video and on the
27:53 - card so it just pops it up another level
27:57 - there uh which I don't really think is
28:00 - necessary I think it'll end up looking
28:03 - like a card anyway uh if we get rid of
28:06 - this one because we have a shadow in the
28:08 - video uh and then we can just put this
28:11 - text above it and see how it
28:14 - looks so let's try that and I'll have
28:20 - to I need to figure out what the URL is
28:23 - so I'll inspect this page uh on my other
28:27 - screen
28:28 - just to grab the URL so um I don't
28:32 - really think there's that much value in
28:35 - showing showing you all on on my the
28:37 - screen that you can see uh me just going
28:41 - through these elements actually maybe I
28:44 - will and then you can see you can see
28:46 - for yourselves whether or not this was
28:48 - built properly you can see the
28:53 - structure uh so this was my first
28:56 - project for when I started working here
28:58 - here we go okay so this is
29:00 - our our video and I think I'm going to
29:04 - grab I'm GNA grab all of
29:07 - this
29:09 - so
29:11 - copy
29:14 - element now will this
29:17 - copy I'm hoping this copies everything
29:20 - inside the element I'm not really sure
29:21 - if it will let's let's test it
29:24 - out awesome it did okay there's several
29:28 - options to copy when you go to copy from
29:30 - Dev tools and uh I'm always like not
29:33 - sure what each one
29:34 - does uh and i' I've never taken the time
29:37 - to try them
29:38 - out okay so we have that I'm going to
29:41 - leave that there uh so it's it's easy
29:43 - for me to get to and let's go
29:48 - to tutorial here we go so we'll go to
29:52 - the tutorial page and I want to bring
29:54 - this over here I have way too many pages
29:57 - open at this point
29:58 - uh so I'm going to get rid of some of
30:09 - them oh actually this reminds me uh
30:11 - before I get rid of this one I had
30:14 - someone uh message me on Twitter and say
30:18 - that they were getting an error when
30:20 - they were trying to run the program and
30:22 - the image they sent me an image of the
30:25 - error and it was uh snav .js on line
30:30 - 34 so if anybody else is getting this
30:33 - error let me know but basically uh the
30:36 - error was saying
30:39 - um handle close is not
30:43 - defined so that was the error that it
30:45 - was giving for this page and that's why
30:49 - it wouldn't run when they tried to do uh
30:51 - npm start so if anybody else has this
30:54 - error please let me know I'll I'll try
30:56 - to figure it out I mean it's it's a
30:58 - little hard to figure out since I can't
30:59 - recreate the error on my machine uh so I
31:04 - think
31:05 - it I don't think they said what
31:09 - operating system okay I can see from the
31:10 - screenshot they're they're on a Mac as
31:12 - well so yeah it's just it's really odd
31:16 - that that's not working so if you have
31:18 - any ideas uh please let me know and um
31:23 - because I mean I want I want you all to
31:24 - be able to you know pull this code down
31:26 - and and uh try it out out uh I actually
31:29 - had from the last project I had quite a
31:31 - few people who um pulled down the code
31:34 - for that last project we did with nextjs
31:37 - and um actually did projects based on
31:40 - that so they took you know what I had
31:43 - modified it to suit their needs and came
31:45 - up with some really cool projects
31:47 - so that was I I was like pleasantly
31:51 - surprised that uh that you all were
31:54 - doing that with I don't know that I can
31:55 - really call it with my code because we
31:57 - were collab atively on it so much but
31:59 - with art basically they took what we did
32:02 - and just ran with it and and did you
32:04 - know did their own thing and so that
32:07 - that was really
32:09 - cool uh so I'm going to get rid of the
32:11 - side na
32:12 - now uh I'm going to say don't
32:18 - save okay so here's our
32:22 - tutorial page and let's go to another
32:25 - page and just copy
32:31 - now that I look at it I don't really
32:33 - think there's much we need to copy from
32:34 - here this page is going to be pretty
32:39 - simple okay yeah I'm not going to worry
32:41 - about copying
32:46 - anything and this page can actually be a
32:49 - stateless functional component so let's
32:52 - let's make it a stateless uh functional
32:54 - component and then that way if if
32:56 - anyone's not familiar with that that or
32:58 - why you would want to do it or how to do
33:00 - it uh then this will be kind of a good
33:02 - uh a good demonstration of
33:05 - it uh so oops let me I forgot to start
33:10 - my Pomodoro clock so let me do that now
33:12 - as
33:19 - well oops there we
33:22 - go also I still someone sent me a
33:26 - Pomodoro clock that they had written I
33:27 - think in Java I still have not had a
33:30 - chance to test that out yet I've not
33:31 - forgotten about it though and I will
33:32 - test that out uh so if you're watching
33:36 - uh just be patient with me
33:42 - please okay so let's take let me bring
33:55 - up I just want to see if this is in in
33:57 - the react
34:01 - docks especi if there's someone that's
34:04 - new uh definitely check out the react
34:08 - docs uh but we'll go through this
34:10 - yesterday we had a situation where we
34:12 - did something and they had a really good
34:14 - explanation of it in the react doc so I
34:16 - think it might be a good idea that
34:17 - whenever we're doing something in react
34:18 - to have those ready and then that way
34:21 - like when you all have questions it'll
34:24 - be right there you can see it I can
34:25 - refer to that I'll be able to give you
34:27 - better answers uh than I normally would
34:30 - be able to so I'm going to try to
34:32 - remember to do
34:35 - this okay
34:41 - so our new component okay so here's so
34:45 - you can have a component as a function
34:47 - or you can have a component as a class
34:48 - right now we have it as a class um but
34:53 - we don't need it as a class why would
34:54 - you want to component as a class well if
34:56 - it needs to have State uh if you need to
34:59 - do some some things with it
35:03 - um like if you're going to have the um
35:07 - like use the component life cycle
35:10 - methods then you probably want it to be
35:12 - a class correct me if I'm wrong too in
35:13 - the live chat but this was my
35:15 - understanding of it but if you don't
35:16 - need to do any of that stuff uh then
35:19 - stateless functional component probably
35:21 - the way to go so let's
35:25 - take let me make sure I'm
35:28 - not missing something important before I
35:32 - go on Okay cool so don't think I'm
35:35 - missing anything
35:37 - important and let's see I don't think we
35:40 - did any stateless functional components
35:41 - yet in this project did
35:48 - we no I don't think we have we
35:50 - definitely did in our other projects
35:52 - though
36:01 - let's
36:09 - see I thought we did now now that I'm
36:12 - actually looking for it I can't find
36:22 - any there we go finally I found one all
36:25 - right so you can see like how much more
36:28 - simple this is so side by side uh
36:31 - instead of making a
36:33 - class and then having a render function
36:35 - and return we've replaced all that with
36:38 - just this right so we're making use of
36:41 - some an arrow function uh which that's
36:43 - some es6 uh stuff so if you if you're
36:47 - not familiar with that uh check out more
36:49 - on es6 uh but it's basically a Shand for
36:53 - a function and it has some other very
36:56 - nice benefits uh in terms
36:59 - of what the value of this ends up
37:02 - being uh
37:05 - but that's basically it that's all we
37:08 - need so you can see we have that and
37:10 - then we just export at the bottom you
37:12 - know as normal
37:14 - so let's do
37:19 - that and I'm going to
37:25 - check I'm going to check the live chat
37:27 - right right after I do this uh just
37:29 - because I want to make sure I didn't say
37:30 - something wrong when I was explaining
37:32 - that and I know you all will have
37:33 - corrected
37:37 - me okay so here we go and that's it
37:41 - that's all we need instead of what we
37:43 - had before so I mean it may not seem
37:45 - like a a big deal uh
37:48 - but it definitely make things things
37:51 - look a little bit cleaner and if you
37:53 - were making a lot of components you know
37:55 - that little bit of of time would add up
37:58 - not only in creating it but then also
38:00 - going back and having to read through
38:01 - components you know that's two less
38:04 - lines that you have to scan through you
38:06 - know with your eyes so uh I'm sure that
38:09 - that all adds up at some
38:12 - point okay so we
38:14 - want a
38:16 - container and actually it might it might
38:19 - be useful to grab our container classes
38:22 - from somewhere else so just so we don't
38:24 - type it over again so this is way more
38:27 - than we actually
38:29 - need but we'll get rid of a bunch of
38:32 - it and um now I lost Where I Was Here We
38:36 - Go
38:40 - tutorial so we need our container class
38:43 - and a row and a
38:46 - column so let's get rid of most of this
38:51 - and we'll just keep that first part
39:01 - there we go and we're going to keep our
39:04 - row we'll get rid of this
39:12 - column and we'll get rid of
39:17 - this
39:19 - okay now we can bring this over
39:28 - and we need to change our class to class
39:30 - name so in the last project we had oops
39:35 - guess that's it in our last project we
39:37 - had actually had something that let us
39:39 - use class um and it just automatically
39:43 - um work that out for us but I don't
39:46 - think I brought that over to this
39:48 - project so uh I may end up bringing it
39:50 - over but at this point I do need to
39:52 - change the class name that's probably
39:54 - better so that uh you all don't get
39:56 - confused like if if someone's joining in
39:58 - and didn't realize that I had that uh
40:01 - going and you know running then they
40:03 - might not understand why I can use class
40:07 - and they couldn't use
40:08 - class uh let's
40:12 - see I'm not sure if these props will
40:17 - work we'll see we'll try it out I mean
40:19 - it'll be obvious if they don't work so
40:22 - save that let's check out what's
40:25 - happening all right cool so
40:29 - what is
40:34 - this so it definitely doesn't look uh
40:37 - like we want it to look but at least we
40:39 - have it on the page so we we have the
40:41 - video and we have some some sort of
40:45 - Shadows going on uh so let's see
40:49 - actually this would be a good time to
40:51 - check
40:52 - materialize and see if they have
40:54 - something
40:56 - for um uh for
40:59 - video or I'm sorry material UI I think I
41:02 - said materialize I meant material
41:09 - UI actually you know what that's that
41:12 - might be the reason uh I don't have I
41:15 - brought over the classes for video
41:17 - container but I didn't bring over any of
41:19 - the actual code
41:21 - so that makes sense uh so I'm going to
41:25 - bring that over I I totally forgot I did
41:27 - say I was going to check the
41:30 - um the live
41:32 - chat so let me check oh okay sorry I
41:37 - forgot to start the enro
41:41 - server let me do
41:49 - that where am I
41:53 - at
41:55 - okay sorry about about
42:00 - that so if you would like to check out
42:03 - the project uh you know as we're
42:05 - developing it uh in real time you can go
42:09 - here I'll paste this into the live
42:12 - chat uh if you can't see the link in the
42:15 - live chat if you can't get to it for
42:16 - some reason um I'll leave it up on the
42:18 - screen for just a minute uh but as you
42:21 - can see you know here's all our
42:23 - connections um
42:27 - now you can you can follow along you can
42:29 - inspect things um you're not limited to
42:32 - seeing what's on my
42:50 - screen my boss just sent me a slack
42:52 - message in
42:54 - Latin I'm not familiar with one of the
42:56 - words so I need to Google translate this
43:34 - so I'm pretty sure he just I'm going to
43:36 - leave out the name of the company's
43:38 - product but he I'm pretty sure he just
43:40 - told me in Latin that this company's
43:43 - product is
43:44 - destroyed so maybe something that we use
43:48 - here at the university is has crashed
44:00 - okay he was responding to um a note a
44:04 - message I'd sent him earlier about uh
44:07 - the analytics code not not working so
44:14 - anyway I used to teach Latin so if
44:16 - you're confused as to why he's sending
44:18 - me a message in Latin that's that's why
44:20 - and then he he also knows quite a bit of
44:23 - Latin as well
44:25 - so don't normally just speak Latin
45:08 - okay so I don't normally get distracted
45:11 - by other people uh in my my office
45:13 - whenever I'm working but occasionally it
45:17 - happens and I like when it happens
45:18 - because that's like accurate uh of a
45:22 - normal workday is sometimes you you get
45:24 - interrupted with things
45:32 - okay it seems as if there's some good
45:35 - discussion going on in the live chat so
45:37 - I'm I'm just like looking in the middle
45:39 - of it
45:40 - here uh
45:43 - so I'm going to I'll check back in on
45:45 - this a little bit later and see if I can
45:47 - figure out what's going on but right now
45:49 - I'm not I'm not exactly sure
46:16 - okay all right it doesn't look like I'm
46:18 - missing anything uh that I need to
46:22 - address in the live chat right now uh if
46:24 - you did ask a question I am going to
46:26 - come back later on try to find uh all
46:28 - the questions and answer them so um uh
46:32 - just stick around if you can all right
46:35 - so that was definitely the enro was
46:37 - definitely on the screen long enough uh
46:39 - for everyone to uh navigate there if
46:41 - they wanted to
46:43 - so as I was saying there's
46:47 - um right now uh there's no Styles
46:50 - associated with the classes that we had
46:52 - on uh on this video so let's pull over
46:55 - the styles
47:03 - and let me
47:11 - see I think I
47:14 - had yeah these are just from materialize
47:17 - okay so let's go we have materialize
47:20 - here so let's pull it from here because
47:22 - I'm sure these are all from a much older
47:26 - version of material realize I'd rather
47:27 - get the newer versions I know that they
47:29 - did change a bit about their um box
47:32 - Shadows uh to make them a little bit
47:35 - more you know accurate to the material
47:37 - design spec uh so there's definitely
47:39 - been some some updates since I built
47:41 - this so I want to get the
47:46 - updates all right so video container we
47:50 - want this for
47:55 - sure and
47:58 - where are we going to put
48:04 - this okay we want to add this in our
48:10 - Styles I'm not sure how how small is too
48:13 - small for a CSS file let me show you
48:17 - what's going to go in
48:23 - it this is pretty much going to be it uh
48:26 - I do maybe I need to bring this depth
48:28 - over but if I'm going to bring the depth
48:32 - over I might want to bring more of them
48:35 - I guess if I'm just bringing the the
48:37 - depth this one depth thing over it
48:40 - should be
48:55 - fine okay
49:02 - I definitely don't I don't want all this
49:04 - stuff C depth one half no I don't want
49:07 - the
49:08 - half uh so I don't want it apply to all
49:11 - of this stuff because I don't want to
49:13 - mess with any of the material UI
49:16 - things so I'm going to get rid of all of
49:21 - this okay
49:24 - but yeah you can see so they've
49:26 - definitely
49:27 - this is definitely a different box
49:29 - Shadow than the one I'm seeing in uh the
49:31 - original version so they definitely have
49:33 - updated their box Shadow since
49:53 - then normally I I don't do the files
49:56 - like this but thought I'd tried the
49:58 - command line is definitely
50:20 - faster my editors okay good I thought my
50:24 - editor was going to crash you know right
50:26 - there in the middle of right here in the
50:29 - middle of the stream that would be
50:33 - bad okay uh
50:45 - let's let's link to
50:51 - materialize there we go and then now
50:53 - we're going to want to import these
50:54 - styles
50:57 - so this is actually really cool um in in
51:01 - react if you do split your Styles up
51:03 - like this into separate files you don't
51:05 - have to load them everywhere uh so
51:10 - normally if you were making a website
51:13 - you may have all your Styles in one file
51:15 - and they act they just load on every
51:17 - page whether or not they're
51:19 - needed uh so I mean you don't have to do
51:22 - it like that but that's kind of what
51:24 - people normally do or at least what they
51:26 - have done in the past so with this uh
51:30 - we're going to import this into this
51:32 - component and then whenever we use this
51:35 - component which in this case this
51:37 - component is actually going to be the
51:38 - entire tutorial view so the Styles will
51:43 - get pulled in when we need it and they
51:46 - won't need to be uh
51:49 - used right if we don't need it so that
51:51 - it just helps keep things uh smaller
51:58 - so
52:03 - let's I just want to pull over here we
52:12 - go no actually that's that's not what I
52:14 - want because I
52:15 - [Music]
52:18 - want I don't have anything else here we
52:22 - go dang it I wanted to copy to save time
52:26 - time and just copy this this import but
52:28 - I guess I guess it won't save me time
52:31 - since I looked everywhere
52:36 - already I'm assuming that we
52:44 - had here we
52:48 - go this is what I was trying to
52:50 - do actually I don't want it there I want
52:53 - it down below
53:02 - okay so when we import this in we have
53:04 - to we have to think about where we're at
53:07 - in the the folder structure uh so right
53:10 - now we're in the views folder so we need
53:12 - to go up one folder and then down into
53:15 - the Styles folder so that's why we have
53:17 - dot dot slash so that takes us up then
53:21 - down into Styles then into video. CSS
53:26 - okay so that's like the main reason why
53:28 - I just wanted to copy it so I wouldn't
53:29 - have to think about
53:31 - that and uh ended up not really saving
53:35 - any
53:38 - time and I copied it into the wrong file
53:45 - anyway
53:48 - not there we go I'm just I'm just
53:51 - laughing at myself now um okay
53:56 - now that's in the right file let's see
53:58 - if that had any impact on how this
54:02 - looks none none at all
54:11 - really what is going
54:21 - on it looks
54:24 - like why is video container not being
54:27 - applied
54:31 - um thought video container position
54:42 - relative okay so it seems like what's
54:46 - happening let me show
54:48 - you what I'm
54:51 - seeing which is a little bit weird uh so
54:55 - this video contain
54:57 - class um it's not the Styles aren't
55:00 - being applied what is
55:08 - this this
55:10 - is really
55:24 - odd Okay so evidently that these have
55:27 - all been brought in somewhere else and
55:29 - so that was being
55:39 - applied so this was probably brought in
55:41 - with the uh pool request
55:44 - for uh the upload uh input yeah so
55:49 - that's cool so if that was needed
55:52 - there let's see what's going on with our
55:56 - uh that's what's
56:02 - happening I didn't change it
56:05 - okay all right well that's slightly
56:08 - better right so we have um it's not
56:12 - going outside the bounds here but that's
56:14 - definitely still not what we
56:18 - want okay so in about two minutes I'm
56:20 - going to check back in with the uh with
56:22 - the live chat
56:26 - so let's see what's going on
56:30 - here let bring this
56:33 - over
56:36 - um I'm going try
56:39 - to make it so that we can see both
56:41 - things at
56:45 - once okay so we
56:48 - have this
56:54 - border it's quite
57:01 - it's quite
57:11 - thick there we go so I'm not sure what
57:15 - was going on with the Border but this is
57:20 - better right I mean that's that's much
57:23 - better we don't want the Border there
57:25 - okay so
57:27 - for I'm not sure where that border was
57:30 - coming
57:31 - from let's
57:43 - see okay I guess that was just the
57:46 - default and for some reason there was
57:49 - nothing um you know what there there's
57:52 - probably some stuff at the very
57:53 - beginning of the materialized file that
57:55 - gets rid of lot of the default Styles so
57:58 - I'm guessing there's just default the
58:01 - iframe you know default border they get
58:04 - rid of it at the top so we didn't
58:05 - include that stuff so that's why it was
58:07 - in there uh so I'm just going to put
58:11 - it uh since the video video container if
58:14 - frame was it on the ey frame yeah yeah
58:17 - so that border was on the ey frame so
58:20 - since we already have this here and it's
58:23 - already targeting uh the iframe let's
58:25 - just just
58:28 - put border none here and then see we'll
58:33 - double check make sure that
58:38 - works okay cool that's
58:43 - working all right so I'm not sure if I
58:47 - went too fast through that uh sorry
58:49 - about that but
58:51 - basically um if if you didn't know what
58:54 - I was talking about there are some
58:56 - default Styles so when you see stuff
58:58 - like user agent
58:59 - stylesheet uh elements get default
59:02 - Styles and usually if you use a
59:05 - framework a CSS framework one of the
59:07 - first things that they do in their main
59:09 - CSS file is just get rid of all the
59:12 - default Styles so they'll just sometimes
59:15 - they just set it all like to nine or to
59:17 - zero or anything or something so that it
59:19 - doesn't interfere with what they're
59:20 - trying to do later
59:22 - on uh so that's what I was talking about
59:25 - and so we don't have that cuz we didn't
59:28 - import all of materialized we just
59:30 - imported the pieces we
59:31 - need so we could if we really wanted to
59:34 - I guess import that part of materialize
59:37 - if I run into more things like this it
59:39 - might make sense but since it was just
59:41 - this this the only time I've seen this
59:44 - something like this happen so far it was
59:46 - made more sense just to put border none
59:49 - you know right on that that iframe since
59:51 - we're already targeting that in our CSS
59:54 - file uh so
59:56 - that's why I did it like that so
59:59 - obviously we want to do a bit more with
60:01 - this uh definitely want to make sure
60:02 - it's centered and uh that's going to be
60:06 - an easy fix we just need to fix our
60:08 - column classes and uh then everything
60:11 - should be looking pretty good uh we're
60:13 - definitely going to want some sort of
60:15 - padding here maybe even vertically align
60:17 - this uh so if we haven't already done so
60:20 - we might want to bring over the uh some
60:23 - of the vertical line stuff from
60:24 - materialize
60:26 - not exactly sure it'll
60:28 - work I'll have to see it might work uh
60:32 - without using like the whole page
60:33 - structure I think as long as we have our
60:36 - container row column structure uh it
60:38 - should work so that's what I'll do
60:42 - after the break is over and uh the break
60:46 - will be to catch up on the live chat uh
60:49 - also the Instagram feed is now
60:53 - finished so uh thanks for watching if
60:56 - you check that
60:58 - out and that will be available for 24
61:01 - hours uh if you want to view it later
61:04 - the link for my Instagram's in the
61:09 - description oh man I
61:13 - just I just grabbed my phone and like
61:15 - clicked it with my my right hand which
61:18 - is the the bad hand because I just keep
61:20 - forgetting and it it
61:22 - hurts let me uh let me scroll up a bit I
61:26 - know I missed a lot in the live chat uh
61:28 - CU you all have been uh been talking a
61:31 - lot which is awesome I love when the the
61:34 - live chat's
61:36 - active so I'm going to scroll all the
61:38 - way up to the top because I'm I'm afraid
61:40 - I'm going to lose some of the messages
61:42 - uh because there's so many of
61:44 - them
61:46 - um it looks like right now I'm not not
61:49 - losing anything
61:52 - so I I shouldn't lose anyone's things
61:55 - and also I'm going to skip over some of
61:57 - the questions got really good answers uh
61:59 - already in the live chat from you all so
62:02 - I'm going to skip those so if if you
62:04 - answered if you asked a question early
62:06 - on and I don't get to it uh then that's
62:09 - probably why if you really want me
62:12 - personally to answer it uh let me know
62:15 - uh either put the question again in the
62:17 - live chat or send it to me on Twitter
62:37 - uh Zakaria asks said uh I'm new to
62:40 - programming is react a better version of
62:42 - jQuery
62:45 - um I I don't they're not comparable in
62:48 - the same way uh so I would say no but if
62:51 - you're going to use react you can
62:53 - probably do anything you'd want to do in
62:55 - jQuery you could do it in react without
62:58 - having to use jQuery so in a sense I
63:02 - guess you can pretty much
63:06 - replace I don't want it's not like you
63:08 - can just bring react into a project that
63:10 - you're using jQuery and and replace it
63:12 - so yeah so I I wouldn't compare them
63:15 - directly I guess uh but if you are using
63:19 - react then you probably don't need
63:21 - jQuery you could do everything with with
63:25 - just react
63:26 - um the only thing I'm thinking of that
63:29 - just like Ajax stuff but you'd probably
63:32 - want to use fetch for that anyway
63:35 - so uh cuz react doesn't have you know
63:38 - their own way of handling things like
63:48 - that uh Ron to Runner asked hey Jesse
63:51 - what do you think about semantic UI uh I
63:54 - don't I don't know really anything at
63:56 - all about semantic UI I've seen it
63:58 - mentioned uh before uh in the live chat
64:00 - but I haven't had a chance to check it
64:01 - out so sorry but I don't I don't really
64:05 - have any opinion about it uh at all uh
64:08 - ronto runner also ask what's the best UI
64:10 - for react uh I don't I don't really know
64:13 - how to answer that question either uh
64:15 - because this is the first project that
64:17 - I'm actually using a UI framework
64:20 - specifically for react I've attempted
64:23 - before to use materialize
64:26 - with react and to try to make it work uh
64:29 - the only downside is so things aren't
64:32 - organized already into
64:34 - components and it uses a lot of jQuery
64:38 - so that's why I've switched for this
64:40 - project to using material
64:42 - UI but I haven't really tried any other
64:45 - ones out so I I don't think my opinion
64:47 - is uh worth much at this point
64:56 - Zakaria ask should I learn jQuery to
64:58 - learn react or angular or can I start
65:00 - with them right
65:04 - away uh you don't need to learn jQuery
65:06 - to learn react or angular and in fact if
65:09 - you really want to learn react I say you
65:10 - can just skip jQuery and go straight
65:13 - into react
65:16 - um I don't know if it's still like this
65:18 - with angular but at one point angular
65:20 - had like a jQuery light that came with
65:23 - it I guess where you could do some stuff
65:24 - with jQuery and you didn't have to bring
65:27 - in all of jQuery so I don't know if they
65:30 - still do that with the newer versions of
65:31 - angular
65:33 - so um let's see okay ducon says uh and
65:38 - sorry if I'm mispronouncing that uh but
65:40 - ducon says react and angular are not
65:42 - using jQuery okay so evidently the newer
65:45 - versions of react have gotten rid of
65:47 - jQuery
65:48 - completely uh so yeah so then I would
65:51 - say I I don't know enough about angular
65:54 - to say for sure but I would say
65:56 - definitely if you really want to learn
65:58 - react you can skip
66:09 - jQuery okay so my five minutes is up I'm
66:11 - just going to scroll a little bit uh
66:13 - just because I as I said earlier I don't
66:15 - want to lose some of the earlier
66:17 - messages
66:40 - okay
66:42 - um Duan asked how long are you
66:45 - programming I'm not sure if you mean how
66:47 - long have I been programming or how long
66:49 - this particular stream will go uh this
66:52 - stream will probably go for like about
66:53 - another hour and and
66:57 - um if you were asking how long I've been
67:01 - programming
67:02 - um I don't I need to write this down I
67:05 - always have to think um let me
67:08 - think like five years I guess but maybe
67:13 - not like maybe like really seriously
67:16 - trying to be a good JavaScript developer
67:18 - for like I don't know like three or four
67:21 - out of the five years
67:26 - okay so let me
67:29 - um let me get back to some of the code I
67:32 - want to check so I'm stopping at the
67:34 - live chat at at the point where it was
67:36 - 2:22 p.m. for my time so I'm going to
67:39 - write that down so I remember and don't
67:41 - have to try to find where we were
67:50 - at all right that's another thing that
67:52 - I'm trying to write with my right hand
67:54 - and that's not not so easy right
68:05 - now okay so let's change these column
68:08 - classes and get this uh oriented
68:12 - properly so right now the reason it's
68:15 - over here is because we have it set to
68:19 - take up on medium siiz screens and
68:21 - bigger we have it set to take up only
68:24 - half of the screen only six of the 12
68:26 - columns we are we have imported the
68:28 - column classes from materialize so we
68:31 - are using material UI but we've also
68:34 - imported some stuff from
68:36 - materialize uh so I I suppose like
68:40 - that's probably confusing so that's
68:42 - definitely worth repeating uh probably
68:46 - for every stream uh I think I have I
68:50 - think I put it in the description but I
68:51 - didn't really explain it in the
68:53 - description so basically what we want to
68:55 - do is just get rid of this and now let's
68:58 - see how it
69:01 - looks all right cool much better uh much
69:04 - bigger and at this point I do want to
69:08 - try to have this aligned vertically now
69:11 - we're going to use flex box for
69:13 - this so that means it may not work in
69:17 - older browsers which is fine with me uh
69:21 - especially this is a site that's Geared
69:24 - for an internal a audience and I'm of
69:27 - the opinion that I'd rather try to push
69:30 - everyone here at the University to use
69:32 - modern browsers because that's a safer
69:34 - thing for them to be doing uh so I don't
69:37 - feel bad about not supporting older
69:39 - browsers if it was an external site I
69:42 - might think more about it uh depending
69:44 - on the audience uh but internally like
69:47 - there's there's really no excuse uh you
69:50 - know no one even needs to update
69:53 - themselves in fact they can't update
69:54 - anything themselves their computers are
69:56 - all on lock down uh all they' need to do
69:58 - would be call or email the IT department
70:01 - and they would update the browser so
70:03 - given that given that all it takes is a
70:06 - short phone call or email I'm definitely
70:08 - fine with only supporting the latest
70:10 - browsers for internal sites which ends
70:12 - up being cool because we could do you
70:15 - know cool things and not worry about
70:16 - supporting older stuff so let's grab uh
70:20 - I'm not going to do the flexbox vertical
70:22 - line from scratch because materialize
70:25 - are already has some of that built in so
70:28 - let's find it and materialize and pull
70:30 - that
70:33 - in uh let me
70:39 - see I had to think for a second of what
70:42 - it was called uh so we have this Vine
70:46 - wrapper
70:49 - and why is it
70:51 - not all right well let's pull this in
70:53 - and then we'll also need a a Vine class
70:58 - which I'm I'm not sure why that is in a
71:01 - different
71:04 - spot so let's bring it I'm going to put
71:07 - it in here for now just to make sure it
71:08 - works but I think this would probably be
71:10 - better uh if I put this
71:14 - in our main uh CSS file because we're
71:17 - probably going to use this on every
71:20 - page uh so it'll be better there
71:25 - oops here we
71:37 - go actually that's weird I really
71:40 - thought there was supposed to be a Vine
71:45 - class and not just a
71:48 - rapper what is going on
72:16 - maybe um things got updated in a newer
72:19 - version of materialize and so I'm just
72:22 - I'm
72:23 - not familiar with that
72:26 - let me check the documentation
72:32 - then see what I'm
72:41 - missing yep wow okay so in the newest
72:44 - version of materialize they got rid of
72:46 - the need to so before the way it worked
72:49 - is you had to have a Vine wrapper on the
72:53 - container div and then inside I would
72:55 - have to actually put the class V align
72:58 - uh on this if I wanted it to be
73:00 - vertically aligned so I guess they've
73:02 - changed that
73:05 - and that that must have been pretty
73:07 - recently either that or I've just been
73:09 - adding that class for no reason for a
73:11 - long time and didn't realize that I
73:13 - didn't need it okay cool so that means
73:16 - we have everything we need right here
73:19 - and you can see uh basically you know
73:22 - here's what's here's what we're doing
73:25 - okay now there are some vendor prefixes
73:28 - so uh they're already there we don't
73:30 - have to worry about doing that which is
73:31 - good which is one of the benefits of
73:33 - just copying this over instead of trying
73:34 - to do it
73:36 - ourselves especially because we're not
73:38 - using any type of
73:39 - pre-processor uh ideally I I would have
73:43 - it set up so that I could use SAS and
73:45 - then also set up so that it would put
73:48 - all the um vendor pre prefixes on
73:52 - afterwards uh but I don't have that set
73:54 - up for this
73:55 - project um when I'm not using Create
73:59 - react app or webpack I do know how to
74:02 - set this up with gulp I have no idea how
74:04 - to set it up without using that uh so
74:08 - maybe one day I'll figure it out but not
74:11 - today so let's
74:14 - throw now I just need to figure out
74:17 - what where what I want to put this
74:23 - on so I needed to
74:30 - be all right see our container actually
74:32 - is not going to be a good thing to put
74:34 - it on because you can see the container
74:37 - is already completely filled up so what
74:38 - we what I want to put it on
74:41 - is
74:45 - H I may need to
74:48 - change change this a bit
75:06 - okay all right so I've added a Min
75:08 - height of 100 uh V8 so uh this is
75:12 - viewport height so that means it'll
75:15 - always be as tall as the the viewport um
75:21 - we'll see how this looks if I wanted to
75:22 - really get like a better vertical line I
75:25 - would also maybe do like a calc and then
75:28 - do 100 uh VH minus
75:32 - uh the uh top of this uh so cuz like
75:37 - right now you can see like it actually
75:39 - goes down even below so for now this
75:43 - will just give us a better idea if our V
75:45 - Line will work um but it won't be
75:48 - exactly vertically aligned in the middle
75:51 - uh the reason I did Min height instead
75:53 - of just height uh is that if I set
75:55 - height to 100 uh then what could
75:59 - potentially happen is that you know if
76:01 - our screen was like this let's say we
76:03 - were on a phone in landscape uh mode uh
76:06 - then it might cut things off so we
76:09 - didn't we don't want that so we want it
76:10 - to
76:12 - be at least uh 100 of the viewport
76:17 - height you know or
76:20 - more okay so let's add this on
76:26 - for a container we'll give it the
76:29 - Vine Vine wrapper and then we'll also
76:32 - give it a
76:35 - style
76:38 - of men
76:45 - Heights
76:49 - okay see what
76:51 - [Music]
76:53 - happens that's that's not
76:57 - good all right let's see what's going on
77:01 - okay we have our container it's the
77:02 - right
77:05 - height um okay we have display
77:09 - Flex
77:12 - good now let's see what's happening okay
77:16 - so our
77:17 - row is row column definitely not working
77:22 - all right let's try something different
77:23 - then
77:25 - so let's take the wrapper off of this
77:29 - one
77:32 - and let's save
77:41 - it all right so here's what we're going
77:45 - to
77:49 - do we're going to put
77:52 - it container
77:57 - let's put our height our Min height on
78:00 - our column and add the
78:07 - wrapper also to our column let's see if
78:10 - that
78:12 - works no again not
78:18 - working okay let's see what's going
78:23 - on okay display
78:27 - Flex that I mean that's that's what's
78:29 - messing things up is the display Flex so
78:33 - let's see what's going on here
78:55 - all right I'm going to look at the uh
78:57 - live chat in just a second to see if you
78:58 - all can know what's going on
79:05 - here well it's not bad I mean I we
79:07 - probably could have expected some issues
79:10 - if we're trying to mix and match uh CSS
79:13 - from two different
79:20 - Frameworks okay so it looks like right
79:22 - now it's our height
79:27 - yeah we're having issues with our
79:36 - height actually on the ey
79:39 - frame on
79:49 - this no that's not going to work
79:58 - actually
80:04 - minut okay let me
80:15 - check all right yeah it looks like I had
80:18 - a lot a lot of uh advice here so let me
80:21 - read through
80:23 - it for
81:18 - okay uh John Hansen said I figured out
81:21 - how to set up in web Pack 3 with SAS CSS
81:26 - loader okay said it figured so but it's
81:29 - giving errors can't resolve past the
81:32 - separate module s folded okay
81:35 - so uh John you'll have to let me know if
81:37 - you do get that working I'm very
81:38 - interested in
81:41 - that okay Patrick said the auto prefixer
81:44 - is on by default and create react app
81:49 - apps so I can delete the vendor
81:53 - prefixes uh I don't have to worry about
81:55 - it
81:58 - cool let's do that now so I don't
82:02 - forget I like that it it
82:05 - does it it makes everything
82:08 - look a lot more messy uh to have all
82:12 - these vendor prefixes in
82:28 - okay uh let
82:31 - me let me
82:37 - look where's our I think I have it on my
82:40 - other screen
82:42 - um I want to look at our original uh
82:45 - page since we have it working there and
82:48 - see what the difference is
82:54 - uh in the
82:57 - CSS oh actually no we don't we didn't
82:59 - vertical line that so I can't look to
83:02 - that let's look
83:05 - at
83:06 - [Music]
83:12 - materialize let's see what's going on
83:36 - h
83:57 - all right trying to see what's
84:02 - difference so here's our
84:17 - container okay both display
84:20 - block oh
84:24 - it's not a height
84:42 - problem is that all is that all we
84:45 - needed
85:05 - H I got rid of too much in my display
85:08 - dang
85:11 - it
85:20 - okay all right there we go okay so the
85:23 - problem was just I I had wrongly assumed
85:26 - that it was a height issue uh but it was
85:29 - actually a width issue so uh I looked
85:32 - and saw Zero for what I just assumed was
85:36 - the uh the width cuz I don't know about
85:39 - you but almost every time something like
85:41 - that happens it's usually the height
85:44 - that gets set to zero uh I don't know
85:47 - that I've ever had a a width set to zero
85:50 - when I actually had a height so anyway
85:54 - this works now we just have to make sure
85:56 - we set the
85:58 - width to of the video container to
86:03 - 100% it was 100% oh no that's the if
86:07 - frame so the actual container needs to
86:08 - be with
86:14 - 100%
86:17 - oops okay so this is with
86:21 - 100%
86:23 - And that was it I think that's all that
86:25 - was that that we needed to
86:29 - change okay now as you can see that
86:32 - doesn't look like it's vertically align
86:34 - Okay the reason being right we have we
86:37 - have this container div that is
86:41 - 100%
86:43 - height but it's getting pushed down by
86:46 - the height of of this so let's figure
86:51 - out how tall this is this is kind of
86:54 - where I wish I had uh SAS because I
86:57 - could put some variables and make
86:59 - it a little bit more automatic so that
87:03 - if this height changed I could have it
87:05 - automatically change here but we'll just
87:06 - have to remember to change this if we
87:08 - need
87:11 - to uh let's see
87:15 - height oh that's terrible how is my
87:17 - height
87:22 - that um let me
87:25 - see that's what I
87:36 - want I really want it to
87:40 - be I wanted it to be like a round nice
87:44 - round number but uh it's close enough to
87:46 - 64 that I think if we
87:49 - do uh let's
87:51 - see Min height is 100 VH how do we
87:56 - do
88:00 - um does Cal work if I set it inside of
88:03 - here I never tried it let's try
88:07 - it
88:10 - Cal minus 64
88:14 - pixels okay so if you're not familiar
88:16 - with Cal in CSS uh it's let you do
88:20 - calculations so I want Min height to be
88:24 - the 100% of the viewport height minus 64
88:29 - pixels which is the about the height of
88:33 - our our nav our top nav so let's see if
88:36 - that
88:38 - works
88:40 - cool okay so
88:44 - this is actually closer to being really
88:48 - vertically
88:50 - aligned does that look right to you is
88:53 - that vertically
89:18 - I wonder why I have that little bit down
89:22 - here oh
89:25 - let's check it
89:28 - out yeah that looks about right for
89:32 - being vertically
89:34 - aligned
89:37 - um
89:39 - cool okay what do you all think does it
89:42 - look good to have this vertically
89:44 - aligned would it have been better to
89:45 - have it a little bit closer to the
89:47 - top
89:52 - um I'm okay with
89:56 - this let's
90:08 - see actually we never put in the uh the
90:13 - text so let's bring this text over as
90:15 - well
91:07 - whoa oh because I'm using Flex all right
91:11 - that makes sense
91:58 - all right don't like that that messes up
92:00 - our vertical
92:01 - [Music]
92:11 - alignment so let's think what we could
92:13 - do about
92:16 - it uh we could put
92:38 - would this text make more sense being
92:40 - below the
92:43 - video this almost seems
92:46 - like what I would rather have happened
92:48 - is for someone to watch the video and
92:50 - then if they still can't understand what
92:51 - to do then they can contact me
92:55 - I actually I can't even remember the
92:57 - last time somebody contacted me about
92:58 - this so no one seems to have problems uh
93:02 - at least they don't call me about them
93:05 - um so maybe it would be better to put
93:09 - this below
93:18 - anyway let's see what do you all think
93:21 - and my uh pomodora timer stopped right
93:24 - now so now's a good time to uh get your
93:26 - opinion on this and
93:28 - check the live chat
93:31 - again okay cool it seems like uh we're
93:34 - in agreement then um it would make more
93:37 - sense
93:43 - below Okay cool so sometimes it just it
93:48 - just takes
93:51 - like uh I mean I hate to have like
93:53 - really long periods of silence in a
93:55 - video but I just had to sit back and
93:57 - look at it for a
93:58 - minute
94:01 - um just kind of think about it so um
94:06 - sometimes that's at least for me
94:08 - sometimes it's really helpful to just
94:09 - stop and just stare at it for a while uh
94:13 - or even things sometimes I just close my
94:15 - eyes and just think about what it what
94:17 - it would look like if I move things
94:19 - around and um that that actually really
94:23 - helps me at time times I
94:24 - can work out a lot of issues in terms of
94:27 - layout and design you know just
94:30 - visualizing it and not have to spend a
94:32 - lot of time trying to change the code to
94:34 - make it look like that and uh I'm not
94:37 - really any good with um like sketch or
94:40 - photoshop or you know any of the stuff
94:43 - people use so that that's why if you
94:46 - haven't noticed already like I pretty
94:48 - much do my design in CSS like right
94:51 - there because I'm I'm faster with CSS
94:54 - than I am with Sketch or a similar
95:03 - program okay so I've scrolled up a bit
95:05 - back to where I left off
95:11 - at oh man John Hansen said I hope your
95:13 - wrist heals fast it can take up to a
95:15 - year depending on how badly you wrench
95:17 - the tissue wow um uh thank you uh for
95:20 - for that I'm really glad it or I'm
95:23 - really I really hope that it doesn't
95:25 - take a year
95:27 - uh because it's
95:30 - like like I use my wrist for work
95:33 - constantly right it's not like I'm
95:36 - having any weight on it but I'm just
95:37 - moving it a lot and then lately uh at
95:41 - home so my my youngest is 9 months old
95:46 - and she wants me to hold her constantly
95:48 - so if if I'm home she gets so mad if I'm
95:52 - not holding her so so it makes it hard
95:54 - I'm either holding her with my right
95:56 - hand which hurts or I have her in my
95:59 - left my left arm and then I have to do
96:02 - stuff with my right hand so
96:06 - uh I really hope it heals fast
96:38 - okay I'm just I'm going through trying
96:39 - to find the questions right now uh
96:41 - through the live
96:45 - chat uh Doon says you should do
96:48 - something uh like talk with Jesse
96:50 - sometimes
96:55 - so cool would that would that be more
96:57 - basically like an entire show that's
96:59 - like a question and answer session
97:02 - then I've thought about doing that
97:05 - before I'll have to ask um on my own
97:09 - channel I can do whatever I want so um I
97:12 - may I may do
97:14 - that uh and then I'll have to see I'll
97:18 - have to ask Quincy if um he'd be all
97:21 - right with doing that on free code Camp
97:23 - because I don't want to do anything uh
97:25 - on my own for free code camp like change
97:27 - up the format without asking him
97:30 - because um he you know he invited me to
97:34 - do this uh I don't really want to take
97:36 - advantage of
97:42 - that but maybe it would be cool the only
97:45 - thing about doing things on my own
97:47 - channel is um I always get less people
97:50 - uh because they're just way less people
97:54 - subscribe to my channel so the alert
97:56 - goes out to a lot less people like my
97:59 - own channel has a few hundred I might be
98:03 - up to like 500 now I'm not really sure
98:06 - uh and free code Camp is up over like
98:08 - 180,000 subscribers
98:13 - so uh but that is cool maybe I'll do
98:16 - that uh at some point
98:30 - uh mobin I just saw
98:31 - your my Franciscan
98:45 - thing uh John Hansen says I was curious
98:49 - why the absolute top positioning on the
98:52 - top four in input fields are different
98:55 - than the
98:57 - rest let me go to that
99:04 - quickly
99:06 - um
99:07 - basically these are um single line text
99:10 - inputs and these are
99:12 - multi-line uh so this is just set a bit
99:15 - higher to indicate that it's multi-line
99:32 - okay I'm going to scroll down uh my
99:34 - timer's up I'm going to scroll down a
99:35 - little bit more actually let me check
99:36 - the
99:37 - time wow it's okay I'm just going to go
99:41 - uh right to stick with the live chat and
99:44 - get to the questions because there's
99:45 - still a lot that I haven't gone through
99:47 - yet and um uh we're coming
99:51 - up we've already been going for about
99:53 - about an hour and 40 minutes so I'd like
99:57 - to keep it 2 hours or under if possible
100:00 - so basically we've gotten this page I
100:05 - kind of thought we'd get further than
100:06 - this page but we had
100:09 - some uh some issues that like obviously
100:12 - like this wasn't showing up and I didn't
100:14 - get right away why so basically what
100:16 - I'll probably end up doing is moving
100:18 - this underneath and then sorting out the
100:21 - vertical alignment so that it looks okay
100:23 - okay uh I think I'll like how it looks
100:25 - better if I can find a way to include
100:27 - the height of this and this into the
100:30 - vertical alignment uh so that this will
100:32 - end up being pushed a bit higher which I
100:35 - think I would like anyway uh but it'll
100:38 - look fine because we'll have this at the
100:40 - bottom so like the hole will be
100:42 - vertically aligned even though this will
100:45 - appear to be slightly to the
100:48 - top uh I think that'll look nice also I
100:51 - want to make these are lengths so I want
100:53 - to add a link color so you could see
100:56 - right
100:57 - now right now they have this link color
101:00 - I'm not really sure if I want to keep
101:01 - this color because it can be hard to
101:03 - read so uh I
101:05 - might maybe make this color just a bit
101:08 - darker or go with a completely different
101:11 - color uh I do have some other colors I
101:14 - could work with that are in the color
101:17 - palette so um I'll see uh but other than
101:22 - that this page is
101:24 - pretty pretty much finished so this this
101:26 - may be our first completely finished
101:28 - page with all the proper content and
101:31 - everything uh so the other Pages we
101:34 - have we have the elements on the page we
101:36 - just never put in the right
101:39 - content okay so that's it for that let
101:42 - me let me commit this right now though
101:46 - uh that way if you're not familiar with
101:49 - Git You see how to commit also you'll
101:50 - see what's going on now when we do our
101:53 - our
101:54 - um our testing on Commit
101:58 - so let's check it out so we've added an
102:00 - entirely new uh CSS file here and then
102:03 - we've edited our tutorial. JS so I'm
102:06 - going to do get add and then just do dot
102:09 - because that'll add everything um you
102:12 - could name the specific file but it's
102:15 - faster if you know you want to add the
102:17 - file even if it's just one it's faster
102:18 - to put the dot uh now if we do a status
102:21 - we can see these are both ready to go
102:24 - ready to be committed so let's do get
102:27 - commit uh let's
102:41 - go all right so you can see oh we got an
102:45 - error component is defined but never
102:48 - used oops okay we didn't need component
102:52 - right so if you if you look here we made
102:54 - this a stateless functional component uh
102:57 - so we unlike our other Pages uh so like
103:00 - let's look at home JS right we were
103:02 - saying class home extends component so
103:04 - we needed to bring in component we don't
103:06 - need to do that anymore so we can
103:08 - actually get rid of
103:10 - this uh we do I need to keep react I
103:15 - believe uh so now we can just do this
103:19 - and that was you know we got the error
103:21 - which is great that we get the error
103:23 - erors now rather than you know getting
103:26 - the errors later on uh after afterwards
103:30 - we try to commit and uh so that's much
103:33 - much better
103:34 - so um let's check our
103:38 - status uh we see we've uh We've modified
103:42 - so I do want to do a get
103:45 - add
103:47 - and
103:48 - oops and also I didn't need to put the a
103:52 - in there so sorry about that we've
103:54 - already added so I can just do the M for
103:56 - the message if I would have left the a
103:58 - in that means we're adding and
103:59 - committing at the same time uh which
104:01 - would have been good since we we needed
104:03 - to add this
104:04 - anyway uh but I I don't want to confuse
104:07 - you all you don't really need the a uh
104:10 - if you're just adding a
104:15 - message okay so this first part is auto
104:18 - formatting and looks like that that
104:20 - worked now it's running the test
104:26 - there we go cool so uh you can see we
104:29 - have test set up right now for
104:31 - four uh of the
104:34 - components and it passed all of them it
104:36 - tells us how long it took
104:39 - uh you know all the all the tests that
104:42 - pass so really
104:46 - cool now I'm going to push that up to
104:49 - GitHub and now everything that we've
104:51 - done is avail aailable for you to check
104:54 - out uh in the repo uh on GitHub in the
104:57 - master Branch okay now to the live chat
105:01 - so if you're just sticking around for
105:02 - the coding uh that part of the stream is
105:05 - finished uh thanks so much for watching
105:08 - totally understand if if you need to
105:09 - move on and do something else uh if
105:12 - you'd like to stick around for the
105:13 - question and answer uh that's awesome
105:15 - too if you have a question please put it
105:17 - in the live chat now uh if you can't
105:20 - stick around or if you'd rather ask some
105:23 - something privately you can direct
105:24 - message me on Twitter or really on any
105:26 - other social media I've have people
105:28 - message me on Facebook um
105:32 - LinkedIn I'm trying to think uh where
105:35 - else I've had messages on Instagram so
105:38 - pretty much wherever social media you
105:40 - can find me on uh you can message me on
105:42 - there I've even had people email me I'm
105:44 - pretty flexible with
105:46 - that uh so I'm just going to go right
105:50 - through the live chat I'm about halfway
105:51 - through uh all the chat messages right
105:54 - now I'm going to keep going down through
105:56 - I'm going to try to get most of the
105:59 - questions um let me go for just a second
106:03 - I saw the head of my department just
106:05 - peaked in my door so I just want to make
106:07 - sure it's not any emergency thing be
106:10 - right back

108:02 - okay I'll be right
108:03 - back it's
108:06 - okay I want to make sure it was an
108:08 - emergency it's not
108:50 - I
109:19 - okay I am back I'm really sorry for that
109:22 - that that was probably the longest uh
109:25 - Gap that I've ever had in my Stream So
109:29 - apologies for that especially if you're
109:30 - if you're watching this later on I guess
109:32 - you can fast forward through it uh or
109:36 - skip ahead uh so sorry it was I guess it
109:40 - wasn't exactly an emergency but um it
109:43 - was about the project that I'm on right
109:46 - now uh sort of so uh the live version of
109:49 - this is obviously live and people are
109:52 - submitting things uh through it uh
109:54 - frequently we get submissions every day
109:57 - uh but
109:59 - our um our project manager so we have
110:03 - someone who looks at all the submissions
110:05 - and then assigns them to people uh and
110:09 - she is in Iceland right now uh on
110:12 - vacation uh which is awesome but I now
110:15 - have to sort through all these
110:17 - submissions and assign them uh if
110:20 - they're um if they need need to be
110:23 - worked on immediately otherwise I can
110:24 - wait they can wait until uh um the
110:28 - person who normally does them gets back
110:30 - so anyway it was about a recent
110:32 - submission so I need to make sure that I
110:35 - double check that so I'm going to write
110:37 - a note for myself right
110:42 - now so that I remember to check that so
110:47 - let me get back to the live chat now I
110:48 - hope I didn't lose too many people it
110:50 - looks like we're a little bit below
110:52 - normal Al um but I'll still get uh I'm
110:57 - going to go a little bit past the time I
110:59 - wanted to so the stream's going to be a
111:00 - bit longer than two hours so I can get
111:01 - to the questions uh since I uh left you
111:05 - all hanging for for so
111:09 - long today has been like uh definitely
111:12 - an above average amount of
111:17 - um interruptions
111:31 - okay scrolling
111:38 - through okay it looks like there was a
111:41 - nice discussion here in the live chat
111:42 - about what to use for a back end uh
111:46 - so seems like everything was covered so
111:48 - I'm seeing node PHP python C Rubik
111:54 - uh so really cool great great discussion
111:58 - in
112:05 - there okay uh don Xavier asks how did
112:08 - you manage to get the zindex working
112:11 - with material UI cards I've tried CSS
112:13 - but material UI keeps on resetting the
112:15 - Styles tried to make it uh with Styles
112:19 - uh and same luck okay let's let's see
112:23 - let me check what's going on uh with
112:26 - our with our cards so we do
112:30 - have we have cards here on the
112:34 - homepage
112:39 - um I guess the I mean the zindex just
112:43 - worked I don't I didn't do anything with
112:45 - it
113:03 - Auto so I don't really know I'm not sure
113:07 - I'm not exactly sure since I I don't
113:10 - know what the uh what the issue is so uh
113:13 - don Xavier if you have a link like to a
113:15 - repo or even like a live demo I can
113:17 - check that out and try to give you a
113:19 - better answer uh but I have not had any
113:22 - ZN
113:23 - issues uh with uh the material UI
113:40 - cards okay now net is isn't part of the
113:43 - discussion
114:16 - uh bobic asks anyone know why he's using
114:19 - enr instead of node um I am I'm still
114:22 - using node uh in the background uh enro
114:26 - is just so that you all
114:28 - can uh can view the site so like my node
114:31 - thing is running on Local Host and then
114:33 - you all can check out the enro uh
114:38 - link okay it looks like that was that
114:41 - was already
114:43 - explained uh thanks
114:46 - uh who is that Kevin thanks Kevin for
114:49 - explaining that in the live
114:51 - chat for
115:24 - okay it looks like uh I could see you
115:26 - all caught the fact that I um had
115:29 - included component uh up here and I
115:32 - didn't really need it so thanks for
115:34 - catching I didn't see it in the live
115:36 - chat at the time but thanks for catching
115:37 - that and explaining uh that that
115:40 - shouldn't really have been in there it
115:42 - was just left over from copy and pasting
115:59 - Kevin said I guess in the pre-commit
116:01 - lint step it will be caught if he
116:02 - doesn't notice that is exactly what
116:05 - happened Kevin you're a smart
116:16 - man uh don Xavier there uh there's a
116:19 - discussion in the live chat about um
116:22 - small like size of CSS files and things
116:24 - like that uh don Xavier says simulate 3G
116:28 - and you'll see that smaller CSS is
116:30 - better uh yeah so actually I I recommend
116:34 - that sometimes I um I do all my
116:37 - development uh with 3G so
116:41 - um I wouldn't say oh like when I get to
116:43 - the point where I'm trying to speed
116:46 - things up on a site like I'm doing speed
116:49 - optimizations I try to just have it set
116:52 - on a 3G network all the time to really
116:54 - get a feeling for uh what's uh what
116:58 - users on a 3G network will um uh will
117:02 - experience also I just saw a video about
117:06 - this uh the latest version of Chrome I
117:09 - think Chrome
117:10 - 60 um will let you simulate not only a
117:15 - 3G network but also phones uh that don't
117:19 - really have a lot of processing power so
117:22 - I'm not really
117:25 - sure maybe it's just on Canary right
117:28 - now uh I didn't check to to use it yet
117:32 - so uh if Canary is like the latest uh
117:36 - version of
117:37 - Chrome I I don't have Canary open right
117:40 - now uh but that's also that also would
117:43 - be useful um you know because not only
117:46 - does
117:48 - the network connection matter but the
117:51 - processing power as
117:59 - well uh Kevin says in loading time
118:02 - optimization you need to take into
118:04 - account caching yeah that's
118:15 - true yeah so uh Kevin explains more if
118:18 - it's a big CSS file but it doesn't need
118:20 - to be downloaded again because it's
118:22 - cached uh and then you navigate around
118:24 - the site uh you actually might increase
118:28 - the performance instead of having a lot
118:30 - of small CSS files uh that need to be
118:34 - downloaded uh in aren't cash so yeah
118:36 - actually
118:38 - that's that is a really good point uh it
118:41 - might be interesting
118:43 - to I don't know if we'll have time with
118:45 - this project or not but it would be
118:46 - really cool when we get it to a more
118:48 - finished state to compare the load time
118:52 - s doing it either way so like we could
118:56 - have a branch where we've combined
118:59 - everything into one file and a branch
119:01 - where we have it all split up and then
119:04 - compare that might be really cool to do
119:06 - I hope I don't forget that idea uh
119:08 - because later on like before we before
119:11 - we launch it that would be the best time
119:13 - I think to test it out and then we would
119:16 - decide you know which one we should
119:18 - launch
119:25 - uh Jan
119:26 - thanks uh Jan noticed that I was trying
119:29 - to import the wrong CSS file a little
119:32 - while back so thanks you all always
119:35 - catch my mistakes before I do I should
119:37 - just as soon as something doesn't work I
119:39 - should just look at the live chat
119:40 - immediately I would save a lot of time
119:42 - like that
119:53 - let's see uh John Hansen says does
119:57 - everyone use Auto prefixer from post CSS
120:00 - or is that not needed
120:01 - nowadays um I I have used it on projects
120:06 - recently
120:10 - um I guess it depends on what you're
120:12 - working on so I think next and then
120:17 - create react app will Auto prefix for
120:21 - you
120:22 - um but if you're not using one of those
120:25 - then you would want to to use an auto
120:27 - prefixer
120:29 - so uh also it depends on what browsers
120:33 - uh you're you're targeting as
120:37 - well but really I think I mean if you're
120:41 - once you add it it doesn't really take
120:43 - any extra work and you might get you
120:47 - know compatibility with some extra
120:48 - browsers for it so I think it's
120:50 - definitely worth it sh
121:22 - oh okay Joseph thank you uh Joseph says
121:25 - don't forget to fix your props for the
121:27 - iframe frame border and allow full
121:29 - screen so let me let me do that right
121:31 - now that's definitely something that I
121:33 - would probably forget unless I do it
121:36 - right now
121:38 - so uh let me there should be I should be
121:40 - getting an error message for
121:42 - it so let me show you the error
121:49 - first okay um
121:53 - so we're getting these erors for a frame
121:56 - board and allow full screen so I think I
121:57 - mentioned this when I first pasted this
121:59 - over and I basically just said well I'm
122:02 - not sure if these will work we'll find
122:03 - out uh so I usually forget whether or
122:06 - not these work uh so basically to make
122:09 - these
122:10 - work we just have to camel case them
122:19 - whoops now that should get rid of the
122:21 - air
122:24 - yay all right
122:25 - cool iframe elements must have a unique
122:30 - title
122:33 - property that's interesting okay so our
122:36 - iframe needs to have a unique
122:39 - title I've never heard that so
122:56 - cool all
122:57 - right
123:01 - um all right these error messages always
123:03 - just show up locally um
123:06 - so cool all right uh Joseph again thanks
123:11 - for uh for letting me know about that
123:36 - oh okay uh a little while ago uh I was
123:39 - mentioning um using SAS with webpack uh
123:44 - and in regard to that John Hansen
123:48 - mentions setting up the the SAS loader
123:51 - with web pack is straightforward and
123:52 - works it's the post CSS Auto prefixer
123:56 - that's messing up uh webpack so
124:00 - um okay good to
124:12 - know oh Umberto says Chrome has issues
124:15 - with
124:16 - flex so
124:23 - I'll have to
124:24 - see says I just remember I was trying to
124:26 - use flex to position things on an admin
124:29 - dashboard in uh my home project and read
124:32 - about some issues with chrome and
124:35 - flex uh it looked good in IE and Edge
124:38 - but not on Chrome I think there was
124:39 - something about using inline Flex
124:42 - instead okay I'll have to keep that in
124:44 - mind uh at least for right now on Chrome
124:47 - you know this is doing it was doing what
124:49 - we wanted it to do
124:52 - so maybe there's some other stuff uh
124:55 - with uh Flex box that just doesn't work
124:58 - properly
125:29 - uh Brian says why is he only wishing he
125:31 - was using SAS and not actually using it
125:34 - yeah that's a great
125:36 - question uh I just never I didn't set it
125:39 - up uh so we just just kind of started
125:42 - working on this project and and didn't
125:46 - set it up so that's the only reason uh
125:49 - if I cuz I'm not really sure how to set
125:52 - it up
125:54 - so if if I have time and I guess I could
125:59 - set it up I just didn't think it would
126:00 - be that big of a deal
126:03 - um but at some point I guess it would be
126:05 - good for me to figure out how to get it
126:08 - working uh with create react app uh in
126:12 - this
126:13 - case and use it
126:23 - oh okay uh Patrick says uh like so we
126:27 - have a scroll bar bar showing right and
126:28 - we don't really need a scrollbar showing
126:30 - on this page so definitely want to
126:32 - figure out so we had like a little bit
126:33 - of extra space down here that was below
126:36 - the container so I'll have to get rid of
126:38 - that figure out why it's there get rid
126:40 - of that because for right now the scroll
126:42 - bar doesn't look bad but he rightly
126:45 - reminds me that on Linux and windows the
126:47 - scroll bar will
126:48 - show uh and not look that great
126:53 - so that's yeah that's definitely
126:55 - important to get that sorted out
126:58 - so thanks uh thanks for bringing that up
127:03 - Patrick oh okay Patrick says I'll set up
127:06 - SAS and make a pool request tonight if
127:08 - you want just let me know actually
127:09 - Patrick if if you would like to do that
127:11 - and you have time to do that that would
127:13 - be really awesome and helpful so
127:15 - definitely don't expect you to do it uh
127:18 - so don't feel don't feel at all
127:20 - obligated but I would be I would
127:23 - appreciate it a lot uh if if you did do
127:27 - that otherwise if you don't have time
127:29 - but you know you could send me a
127:31 - resource and then I could try to to
127:33 - research it a bit and do it as well um
127:37 - that would be cool
127:46 - too uh Brian says is it complex to set
127:49 - up with react meaning SAS I'm not a
127:51 - developer but I thought he was using
127:53 - gulp which is obviously pretty easy to
127:55 - set up with SAS with yeah so I'm not
127:58 - using gulp for this project but for
128:00 - previous projects I had SAS set up uh
128:02 - with gulp uh for this project it's web
128:06 - pack but since it's create react app all
128:08 - the webpack stuff is kind of Hidden Away
128:12 - um yes so I'm not really sure how it
128:14 - would work uh in this case
128:24 - oh cool Patrick says uh there are
128:26 - actually instructions in the readme for
128:28 - create react app to set up SAS
128:32 - so I feel like a noob now uh yeah I was
128:36 - actually looking through some of the
128:37 - create react app stuff today I wasn't
128:39 - looking it up for SAS I was looking up
128:42 - uh for how to do set up like a server.js
128:45 - file uh and handle some things with our
128:48 - our uh form inputs uh so so there is so
128:52 - much stuff in the documentation for
128:54 - create react app so from now on I'm
128:57 - going to go there first when I'm trying
128:59 - to do something because there are a lot
129:02 - of different use cases that are
129:03 - addressed there uh it's a really really
129:06 - good
129:17 - resource uh web says hi Jesse I I
129:21 - started your Series yesterday and I'm on
129:24 - day four now loving it awesome uh thanks
129:27 - for saying that I'm glad glad you're uh
129:30 - you're loving the uh Series so
129:33 - far uh and that's cool that uh you're
129:36 - able to join in live today
129:54 - oh cool John Hansen says I can put the
129:57 - text inside the same div container as
129:59 - the flex child uh that's yeah that's
130:01 - kind of what I was thinking is I'd have
130:03 - to put it um to avoid having them appear
130:06 - side by side I'd have to put them all in
130:08 - one
130:09 - container uh so let me let me do that
130:14 - right now
130:40 - let's do that now and see how it how it
130:43 - looks
130:51 - oops did I do that right yeah I did it
130:54 - right okay cool I need to I need to
130:58 - delete
131:13 - this okay cool much better
131:26 - is it just me or does it look like
131:27 - there's way too much space on this side
131:31 - now I can figure it out
131:39 - later oh yeah
131:57 - there we
131:58 - go that new div I made needed to have a
132:01 - width of
132:03 - 100% cool all right prob
132:08 - so uh thanks John uh that was definitely
132:12 - the way to
132:19 - go okay PA says are you creating a new
132:22 - branch and then merging it back in the
132:24 - master one nice it'd be nice to see how
132:25 - it's done actually I didn't for this one
132:28 - um I'll try tomorrow for tomorrow's
132:31 - stream I'll try to remember to do that
132:33 - and if I don't remember and you're if if
132:35 - you're able to join live uh Pablo remind
132:38 - me uh and then I'll definitely
132:41 - definitely do it I have done it in
132:43 - previous videos I don't think for this
132:45 - project though uh but I I don't want you
132:48 - have to go back and search through it's
132:50 - it's like a lot of hours of video
132:52 - content so I'll definitely uh do my best
132:56 - to remember to do it
133:03 - tomorrow uh mija says hi hey how's it
133:06 - going glad you can join
133:09 - us John B says take some notes you don't
133:12 - so you don't forget yeah that's true I
133:14 - should just write it down
133:24 - all right so I'm writing it down right
133:30 - now okay actually now that I think about
133:32 - it if you do look back at some previous
133:35 - videos I think it's actually in the
133:37 - video title that I'm like merging or
133:40 - something so if you want to see me merge
133:43 - something I'll still try to do it
133:45 - tomorrow uh I think I did put it in the
133:48 - title of the video so you could just
133:49 - scroll through the playlist the live
133:51 - coding with Jesse playlist and see uh
133:55 - See the title or Pro even search for it
133:59 - um I can't remember exact I'm pretty
134:02 - sure it had the word merge in
134:11 - it oh okay John B I just just clarified
134:15 - uh about the taking notes that this was
134:17 - in reference to caching a large CSS file
134:22 - over a bunch of small okay so let me it
134:23 - would be good to put that in in here
134:42 - so
134:44 - uh I I'll say four pomodora Cycles just
134:47 - to combine all the files uh cuz the
134:51 - actual testing should be pretty obvious
134:53 - right off the bat okay so now it's in
134:55 - there so I won't
135:02 - forget okay so John Hansen says webpack
135:06 - has a common chunk plug-in that will
135:08 - build a common bundle file that will
135:10 - make two requests per page view the
135:14 - common files hold shared code it's
135:17 - cached and then dedicated files with
135:20 - specific code
135:21 - okay that's
135:23 - interesting so that may be like kind of
135:25 - Best of Both World scenario uh perhaps
135:29 - we may end up with three uh branches
135:32 - that we'll
135:36 - test uh Mike says hey hey just started
135:39 - this series last night I'm excited to
135:41 - catch up on the videos on your next five
135:44 - minute break could you just do a quick
135:46 - 10-second click through on a couple of
135:47 - pages of this project yeah sure I'll do
135:50 - it uh also
135:53 - um so let me do I will do two things for
135:56 - you here uh one is I'm going to paste
136:00 - that
136:02 - link to enro so if you can open this
136:09 - link you can click through the site uh
136:12 - live right now if you want to and then
136:15 - just in case you can't go to that link
136:18 - uh I'll just click through a few pages
136:20 - uh so
136:22 - homepage just some cards uh logos this
136:26 - just is a demo card right now but it'll
136:29 - be very different later
136:31 - on just some cards these are cards uh
136:35 - these actually would normally have
136:39 - um uh it never works on local host for
136:42 - me but uh these would be images and then
136:45 - the card title
136:46 - [Music]
136:48 - below uh we got a Share story form
136:53 - our service request
136:55 - form and then the tutorial which we we
136:58 - worked on today which did I not save
137:01 - that yeah I didn't I just did it in Dev
137:03 - tools I'll have to save the uh with 100%
137:06 - on that container div that we added
137:27 - uh Patrick said so you are just going to
137:30 - email the request form I thought this
137:31 - was connecting to third party backend
137:33 - yeah it is so um what I currently have
137:37 - it doing is an email goes out with the
137:40 - data uh the data gets saved in a Google
137:43 - sheet and then it also gets sent to our
137:47 - um project management system uh we're
137:49 - using Reich uh and they have an API so I
137:51 - can send the data and files uh it's a
137:55 - little bit odd so I I can't send
137:57 - everything all at once what I have to do
137:59 - is create a new
138:01 - project and I can send data with that
138:04 - like all the text input data and the
138:05 - checkbox data then I get in return it
138:10 - gives me the ID of that project and then
138:13 - I can take the ID and then send the
138:16 - files but I need that ID first so I
138:19 - actually have to make two
138:21 - trips uh to get everything over there um
138:26 - but anyway yeah that's what's going to
138:27 - happen so I will it hopefully I'll be
138:31 - able to continue doing all those things
138:33 - although I'm open to setting up some
138:35 - sort of lightweight database and just
138:37 - not using the Google
138:39 - sheet uh so replacing the Google sheet
138:42 - with some sort of
138:45 - database uh but that would be a big
138:48 - learning experience for me because I've
138:50 - never set that up
138:58 - before oh cool Mike said uh that that
139:01 - link the enro link did work awesome okay
139:05 - yeah I'll leave the enro uh server
139:07 - running until I leave today so it'll be
139:09 - running for a little while after the
139:11 - video uh and then that way if anybody
139:13 - wants to keep messing around with it uh
139:15 - then uh it'll be
139:19 - there cool Patrick said I'm looking
139:21 - forward to seeing you hook all that up
139:23 - yeah I'm looking forward to doing it as
139:25 - well hopefully I can make it all work um
139:27 - I mean I made it all work with using
139:30 - jQuery and uh before
139:33 - so hopefully I can make it work again uh
139:38 - of course that was all client side now I
139:39 - want to do it server
139:42 - side all right I've gotten to the end of
139:46 - the uh the live chat
139:49 - so today was really long stream uh but
139:53 - that was at least partly due to me being

140:03 - lot of questions answered so uh pretty
140:06 - good
