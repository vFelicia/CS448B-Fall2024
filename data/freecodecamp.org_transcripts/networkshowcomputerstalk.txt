00:00 - Hi, in this video we will see how
computers talk. Before we do that, I would
00:04 - like to give you an analogy of how
people talk. In this room we have John,
00:10 - Bob, and Mary, and when John wants to
talk to Mary he says, "Hi, Mary! This is John.
00:15 - How are you doing?" Now, when they're in the same room
00:18 - they're sharing the same medium, which is the air and all of them, Bob and Mary
00:23 - hear (listen) to this message but only Mary
responds because it's addressed to
00:29 - Mary. In the same way, when computers
want to talk they share a medium. In this
00:34 - example all these three computers are
sharing a cable. This is how networks
00:40 - were built in the past so you have NIC
cards for each of these computers and
00:45 - they have their own MAC addresses. Now,
let's say if A wants to talk to B, what
00:51 - A does is it sends a message to B
which looks similar to this:
00:56 - "Hey B, you know you use the MAC address to address B, this is A talking and here
01:05 - is my message:
01:06 - "How are you doing?" Now, when this message
is put on this medium everybody on this
01:11 - medium can listen to it. So in this case
B and C can listen to this message.
01:17 - Now what happens is, when C looks at
this message it sees that it's
01:21 - addressed to B so just silently ignores
it and B, when it gets this message,
01:25 - it sees that 'Oh! This message is
addressed to me, so let me reply" and when
01:30 - it decides to reply what B does is: "I
want to know who is talking" so, it looks
01:37 - like the original message and sees it's
A who is talking, so it says "Hey,
01:42 - A, this is B" and the actual message "I'm
doing good"
01:47 - that's how computer talk.
