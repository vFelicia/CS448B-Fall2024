00:07 - hey everybody it's
00:09 - Jesse and
00:11 - um I am streaming from home today and uh
00:16 - if you if you saw the uh two other times
00:19 - where I tried to stream from home you
00:20 - know that the quality is not good so um
00:25 - I I adjusted my settings a
00:27 - lot I don't expect the quality to be
00:30 - good but hopefully the the buffering is
00:33 - a little bit
00:34 - better uh so I'm also today I'm going to
00:37 - try to keep this uh a little bit short
00:41 - and I'm going to do some things that are
00:43 - less code intensive and there'll be more
00:45 - visual feedback you know on the actual
00:47 - website and that should be a little bit
00:49 - easier to see with the decreased quality
00:52 - uh so
00:53 - normally you know I would do this uh
00:57 - from my office
00:58 - unfortunately
01:00 - uh
01:05 - my actually looks like I'm seeing from
01:07 - the live chat the volume is really low
01:09 - as well so let
01:11 - me let me see if I can do anything about
01:15 - that
01:17 - um
01:21 - so my employer has blocked all access to
01:26 - GitHub which which I I mean I really
01:30 - can't I can't work very well without
01:33 - that
01:35 - so I'm going to try to do a stream here
01:38 - I'm
01:39 - hoping that by next week we get access
01:43 - again uh otherwise I just I
01:48 - will I'll be working from home a lot so
01:51 - I can access GitHub I won't have a lot
01:56 - of
01:58 - um
02:00 - I don't know I won't have a lot of time
02:01 - in the office to be able to stream so
02:03 - I'll have to figure something out um
02:05 - maybe I can definitely do pre-recorded
02:10 - videos um I see yeah I'm working on the
02:13 - I'm working on the volume
02:14 - now I'm not sure what the problem
02:18 - is okay I found it now is that better at
02:23 - all uh the
02:28 - volume oh
02:30 - wait a second for a response
02:32 - here um yeah I'll expl so um I got some
02:36 - questions why would they block GitHub
02:39 - so so you guys have heard the uh like
02:42 - the Peta ransomware thing that's going
02:46 - on uh it's not really ransomware I guess
02:48 - they're saying now it just is a a wiper
02:51 - um
02:54 - so okay is it better now yeah actually
02:57 - in in my sound settings so in in OBS
03:00 - that's my streaming software the sound
03:02 - settings were fine but in the actual
03:03 - settings for my Mac somehow the input
03:07 - volume for the microphone got turned
03:09 - almost completely down and I'm not sure
03:11 - how that happened I don't remember doing
03:13 - that
03:14 - but
03:16 - um but that happened that actually makes
03:19 - sense because yesterday I was doing a
03:20 - Skype meeting with this this laptop and
03:24 - um they were having trouble
03:27 - hearing uh people talking so that's
03:31 - probably the reason but anyway um
03:34 - so someone in the IT department is on a
03:38 - list serve and someone on that list
03:40 - serve emailed out to everybody that they
03:43 - had actually seen this virus this this
03:46 - Peta or not Peta whatever they're
03:48 - calling it now they'd seen it when it
03:50 - first got you know started to uh do its
03:54 - work and they noticed that they
03:56 - downloaded something from
03:58 - GitHub and that was the the only message
04:01 - right so based on that they shut down
04:04 - GitHub uh luckily one of my co-workers
04:07 - alerted me to that on Wednesday so I
04:10 - didn't even bother coming in that's why
04:12 - I didn't do a stream on
04:14 - Wednesday
04:16 - yesterday it they had
04:19 - reactivated they they unblocked it so I
04:21 - could get access to it so yesterday I
04:23 - was actually able to go in the office
04:24 - but then I had during my normal stream
04:26 - time I had a really long meeting uh um
04:30 - and then even earlier on I I had some
04:32 - meetings early in the day so my whole
04:34 - day was taken up so I couldn't do a
04:36 - stream like I wanted to stream yesterday
04:37 - but I just didn't hadn't have the time
04:40 - so then I went into work
04:42 - today and the first thing I always do is
04:44 - try to do a get pool and it wouldn't
04:47 - work and so then I tried to do tried to
04:50 - go on GitHub and it wouldn't work so I
04:53 - called over uh to the IT department and
04:56 - they had in fact blocked GitHub again
04:59 - and uh when when I asked how long it
05:00 - would be they said oh not that long and
05:02 - I I said well were we talking like days
05:04 - and they said yeah hopefully just days
05:08 - so evidently they're waiting for their
05:11 - antivirus software to come out with an
05:15 - update that protects them against this
05:17 - ransomware and when that update comes
05:19 - out then they will unblock
05:22 - GitHub so that's the story so I'm I
05:27 - really this really stink
05:30 - because I have a lot of work to do and I
05:33 - also want to
05:36 - stream uh I haven't streamed that much
05:38 - lately this week and I I miss it I miss
05:41 - all you guys uh and girls
05:44 - and uh so hopefully this all gets
05:47 - resolved and I can get back to my normal
05:49 - streaming and you don't have to suffer
05:50 - through this terrible quality uh video
05:54 - stream um unless unless I could find
05:57 - somewhere else that has better internet
05:58 - that I could go to to work then maybe
06:01 - but I there's not really any like
06:03 - workplaces I'm I live in a small City so
06:07 - there's just not really a good place
06:09 - that has great Wi-Fi that I can go to
06:11 - work but if I can find one I will
06:13 - hopefully it won't come to that and I
06:15 - can just go into the office and do it so
06:21 - anyway
06:25 - um okay I see everybody in the live chat
06:27 - now hey hey everyone
06:34 - um
06:36 - so I have a a lot of of news so the uh
06:39 - we are going to go over some CSS changes
06:42 - uh today I thought that would just be
06:44 - simple given the uh bad quality of the
06:46 - stream it'll be way easier to see what's
06:49 - going on uh but I just want to give you
06:52 - an overview uh the site's going to be
06:54 - undergoing some major changes in some
06:56 - parts of it so I want to give you a
06:57 - quick overview of what's going to happen
06:59 - I'm going to try to stream as much of it
07:01 - as I can and also I'd like your input on
07:04 - some things uh I will
07:07 - say um I probably only have maybe I
07:12 - think until
07:13 - July around July 19th I need to be
07:17 - pulled off of this project and go to
07:19 - another project so everything that's
07:20 - going to happen needs to happen by July
07:23 - 15th so in addition to what we were
07:25 - already working on before the the
07:27 - biggest thing that I was working on that
07:29 - needs to happen is I need to get all the
07:31 - content of the entire site to be
07:33 - editable from WordPress so I need to be
07:37 - able to pull in all that content either
07:39 - in one API call or figure out how to
07:41 - make multiple API calls with nextjs and
07:45 - how they do their server side rendering
07:47 - so but that's maybe I'll do a video
07:49 - about that um so I have some ideas
07:53 - hopefully I'll get to that so here's
07:54 - what's going to
07:55 - change I'm just going to go through
07:57 - really quickly the change changes the
07:59 - most major changes uh the the really
08:02 - long meeting that I had yesterday was
08:03 - all about changes that need to happen to
08:06 - this site so what we're going to do is
08:08 - we're going to make this whole section
08:10 - smaller so this was pretty like our hero
08:13 - section but it's it's going to become
08:15 - more of just a really big nav basically
08:19 - so this is going to shrink up a bit this
08:22 - will get smaller this text here will get
08:26 - smaller this text and this low logo will
08:29 - get larger now I'm not sure about the
08:31 - size of this logo if I can even make it
08:34 - larger without it getting pixelated so I
08:36 - have to check I think I might be like at
08:38 - the upper end of the range here so uh
08:41 - we'll see maybe maybe I can get a better
08:44 - quality um image that I could make
08:48 - bigger uh so and this is all based uh I
08:52 - got a ton of feedback from several
08:55 - different people that are in this
08:57 - department this kakal institute
08:58 - Department so um I can't really these
09:03 - are pretty much Set uh since I it wasn't
09:06 - really my call for a lot of this stuff
09:07 - although I I did have my input um a lot
09:11 - of this is kind of set so we can't can't
09:13 - really change it the other thing that
09:14 - needs to change is this bar here needs
09:17 - to get a little taller and this text
09:20 - needs to be a larger font size and maybe
09:23 - even a heavier font weight we'll see how
09:25 - that
09:26 - looks um now this is Big this looks
09:30 - terrible now um be just the um where the
09:36 - video was stopped at I was playing the
09:38 - video I guess it a low quality but
09:39 - basically let me do a refresh just so
09:42 - you could see what the thumbnail is for
09:45 - this video there's going to be a full
09:46 - screen video section so this will be a
09:49 - lot smaller so you'll be able to see
09:50 - like half of this and you're going to
09:52 - scroll down and this is a full screen
09:54 - video um I don't know if we'll stick
09:56 - with the YouTube INB bed or if I'll
09:58 - actually pull in the video um but it's
10:01 - going to be click to play I'm not going
10:03 - to autoplay it but this is a video
10:05 - introduction from the head of the kakal
10:08 - Institute that's who the site's for um
10:12 - does like a voice over uh so the we have
10:15 - a videographer in my department who's
10:17 - pretty really good and and he put this
10:19 - together so we're going to put this here
10:23 - uh this section which I had added is is
10:26 - not going to be
10:28 - included um after we we had to talk more
10:31 - about what the goals of the website are
10:34 - which we should have known this from the
10:37 - outset but I think it just took a while
10:38 - for everyone to get really figure out
10:41 - what they wanted this website to do so
10:45 - we moved the mission statement down here
10:47 - instead of it having its own section the
10:49 - quote that was here is actually
10:51 - mentioned in the video so it'll still
10:53 - get in there this section here this
10:55 - formation section is going to be moved
10:57 - up above so so it'll be video the
11:01 - formation section with the four cards
11:04 - and then the mission below it and then
11:07 - below that we'll have announcements like
11:09 - we still we have here and then we're
11:11 - going to add a contact form and then
11:14 - just our normal footer so the homepage
11:16 - is undergoing very significant changes
11:19 - uh there
11:21 - are the about page is going to have uh
11:24 - some links to some informational Pages
11:28 - uh so there I'm just going to have to
11:30 - change it a little bit to include a
11:31 - section there that can display links so
11:33 - I'm not no no use in actually checking
11:35 - that page out at this point
11:38 - the let me let me check the chat real
11:41 - quick in case someone had um some
11:43 - comments on
11:45 - this
11:49 - um
11:53 - okay okay I can see I did have some
11:55 - comments about the whole like GitHub
11:57 - being being blocked thing uh Grayson
12:00 - says uh I can see from a security
12:04 - perspective it makes sense it does get
12:06 - in the way it workflow but I don't want
12:07 - data L yeah um I don't know that it
12:10 - realizes how much I use GitHub and um
12:13 - the the one other person that does um
12:16 - this kind of work in my department uses
12:18 - GitHub uh because it doesn't use GitHub
12:21 - they use some really um old form of
12:25 - Version
12:26 - Control uh it's like a propri AR system
12:29 - I forget what it's called
12:32 - like they were using visual Source
12:35 - visual Source safe or something and now
12:37 - they're using like some Vault thing I
12:39 - don't really know but for them it wasn't
12:41 - a big deal to block it because they
12:42 - never use it uh
12:45 - so yeah I still think the best thing for
12:48 - them to do would be to make sure that
12:50 - all their stuff has the uh the upgrade
12:52 - for the SMB V1 which is from what I
12:55 - understand what that virus is is using
12:58 - uh to do
12:59 - to to get in and actually uh infect
13:03 - everything it seems to me from what I've
13:05 - read if if you have that installed then
13:07 - you should be fine
13:10 - but
13:16 - um let
13:25 - see okay um Emanuel asks why not just
13:30 - make it a WordPress theme and I I know
13:33 - we've gone over this before but I like
13:35 - keep getting that question and uh the
13:37 - reason the reason basically is uh this
13:39 - is using react right now um it's late
13:44 - it's too late in the game to change it
13:45 - to Wordpress theme anyway um but uh
13:49 - there are some advantages to doing it
13:52 - this way as opposed to a traditional
13:53 - WordPress theme and um I'm actually I I
13:58 - don't think I'm not going to go through
13:59 - it all because I know I've done it in
14:00 - past videos but I'll let some people in
14:02 - the live chat fill fill you in on the uh
14:05 - the advantages but basically at this
14:09 - point it just there's no way I could
14:11 - convert this into a WordPress theme fast
14:14 - enough uh for when I need to have this
14:16 - all
14:17 - done um let's
14:23 - see okay John Hansen says uh could
14:27 - convert the uh
14:29 - the logo that's a
14:31 - PNG uh into an
14:34 - SVG and says it works great fairly quick
14:37 - to do all right awesome I hadn't even
14:38 - thought of that but that is a great idea
14:40 - so uh I'll give that if I need to I'll
14:43 - give that a try I do prefer to use svgs
14:45 - whenever I can
14:49 - anyway
14:51 - um Sebastian says well Chrome and kerski
14:55 - decided that YouTube was not
14:57 - secure uh yeah I
15:02 - don't yeah Scott's giving
15:05 - some
15:07 - um some other options for what source
15:10 - control they use TFS IBM uh subversion
15:13 - it's not
15:16 - subversion it might be TFS I don't know
15:20 - I guess it it doesn't matter really but
15:22 - uh I it's definitely not it's not the
15:25 - IBM moment and it's not subversion uh
15:27 - they did use like the old Microsoft
15:30 - one and um that's like not supported
15:35 - anymore uh but they've I'm pretty sure
15:37 - they've switched off of that one onto
15:39 - this new one uh so anyway I'll continue
15:42 - on the the only other section that is
15:46 - getting major changes is the resource
15:48 - section also the event section the uh
15:50 - the geolocation stuff is now live and I
15:53 - do want to thank um
15:56 - Patrick because he submitted two pool
15:59 - requests uh that were kind of in
16:01 - relation to that section let me
16:04 - see
16:09 - um I wonder if he's on uh I just want to
16:12 - bring up the uh contributor section here
16:14 - just to give credit to
16:17 - everyone uh who's been contributing so
16:21 - here we go so uh thanks I zoom in on
16:24 - that a bit I know the quality is bad so
16:27 - hopefully you can see that but uh here's
16:29 - everyone who's contributed this uh so
16:31 - far and I really really appreciate uh
16:35 - all your contributions they've made this
16:36 - so much better than it would have been
16:38 - and I've learned so much from going
16:41 - through uh your code that you've
16:43 - submitted and uh I've already uh I was I
16:47 - was working on just some some little
16:49 - side projects some fun projects uh when
16:51 - I was on vacation and uh I was going
16:54 - back to your pool requests that you all
16:56 - submitted and uh figuring out how
16:59 - everything was done so that I could do
17:01 - it that way on my newer projects uh so
17:04 - really awesome I really appreciate
17:06 - that uh let me go is my resources
17:11 - working there we go uh so the right now
17:15 - the resources section uh is not it's not
17:19 - working exactly as expected the the idea
17:21 - was that it would be it would look kind
17:24 - of like Pinterest right but Pinterest
17:27 - has IM for everything and as you can see
17:30 - there's only one image right now the
17:33 - problem is a lot of the images for these
17:35 - were just way too small and look
17:36 - terrible when they were actually in here
17:40 - uh
17:41 - so the layout for this is going to
17:43 - completely change uh so just
17:47 - briefly uh these will probably stay here
17:50 - and the search will stay here somewhere
17:52 - in the middle and the search might get
17:54 - smaller maybe somewhere in the middle
17:55 - there's just going to be a toggle
17:56 - between free and paid resource ources so
17:59 - it's just going to toggle back and forth
18:00 - I may or may not even keep an icon that
18:03 - denotes whether something's free or paid
18:06 - uh because we'll just have the toggle I
18:08 - I'll see I basically there's probably
18:12 - not going to be a view that includes
18:14 - both free and paid resources together so
18:18 - it may not even be necessary to have
18:19 - this icon we're going to have a drop
18:22 - down here that has a ton of categories
18:25 - the the example given that I'm so
18:29 - basically the people who are in charge
18:31 - of the this institute that I'm doing the
18:33 - website for they want it to be like
18:36 - Amazon okay so
18:38 - basically in the next like two weeks
18:41 - maybe three weeks uh I'm going to try to
18:43 - turn
18:44 - this into Amazon as closely as I
18:48 - can and
18:50 - uh now I I'm definitely not going to try
18:52 - to recreate everything that Amazon does
18:54 - but I'm basically going to make it so
18:56 - that a user could come in here they
18:58 - could pick a category then so they could
19:02 - choose whether they want free or paid
19:03 - then choose a category and then choose
19:05 - whether they want audio or text and then
19:07 - search within that so you can filter
19:09 - down like to very small uh set of of
19:13 - things that you want um so that's that's
19:16 - how the filtering is going to work and
19:18 - then for the UI these cards are going to
19:21 - go away and it's going to look more like
19:22 - a list so I know there's like material
19:26 - design lists let me see
19:32 - let me see if I can show you an example
19:34 - of what it's going to look
19:36 - like or at least in my head what I think
19:39 - it's going to look like so I just did
19:41 - some sketches on paper during the
19:43 - meeting just so that I remembered uh but
19:47 - yeah it's basically going to look kind
19:49 - of have this list uh kind of look where
19:53 - I'm trying to find if there's a a better
19:57 - example down far there okay so this is I
20:00 - guess a decent example where it's going
20:03 - to be more like a list a one column list
20:06 - there'll be images on this side title uh
20:09 - the description will actually be hidden
20:11 - by default but you can click to read
20:13 - more so it'll enable them that to make
20:15 - really long descriptions if they want
20:18 - them uh and it won't mess up the flow of
20:21 - the page and cause a lot of scrolling uh
20:23 - so there'll be a little little arrow to
20:26 - drop down the description or hide the
20:27 - description
20:29 - um and then there'll be just some other
20:31 - basic information about each
20:33 - resource so that'll require a little bit
20:35 - on the WordPress end of things to add
20:37 - the custom fields for
20:39 - that um but then on the UI side of
20:42 - things it'll be you know we'll be
20:43 - changing that significantly uh probably
20:46 - making a new new react component for
20:49 - that uh so that's it those are the major
20:51 - changes that are going to happen uh
20:54 - there there are some other things that
20:55 - are going to happen but they're not it's
20:57 - not really worth talking about it's a
20:59 - lot of a lot more you know kind of minor
21:02 - things so today what I wanted to work on
21:05 - was doing all the changes that I talked
21:07 - about for this
21:10 - section
21:17 - so let me uh I'm just going to check the
21:19 - live chat
21:27 - quickly
21:28 - all right yeah uh philli was responding
21:30 - is uh someone had asked about why not
21:32 - just do it as a WordPress theme and
21:33 - Philip responded and said speed easier
21:35 - load balancing I think not using PHP
21:37 - yeah there's some there there are so
21:39 - many reasons there maybe isn't like one
21:42 - reason that's like for sure you should
21:44 - go this way but there were so many small
21:46 - reasons when you add them all up it made
21:48 - sense for me to do it like this uh and
21:51 - yeah not having to do a lot of PHP
21:53 - template things was a big plus for me
21:55 - because I'm not nothing there's nothing
21:57 - wrong with PHP that's just not where I
21:59 - want to go with my career and my
22:01 - learning path so I want to I want to go
22:04 - more with JavaScript and react and I
22:06 - think it'll be easier in the future
22:09 - given the growth of of react someone to
22:11 - maintain this site if I could just say
22:14 - hey this is just an HTML CSS JavaScript
22:17 - site basically with react someone could
22:20 - step right in if they had knowledge of
22:22 - JavaScript and probably pick up enough
22:23 - of react that they could do it I don't I
22:26 - don't need to say in a job description
22:29 - let's say for somebody who might replace
22:31 - me one day and say you have to know PHP
22:34 - all right I don't need that so anyway
22:36 - but there there's a lot of um a lot of
22:39 - reasons um not to say there's nothing
22:42 - wrong with WordPress um temp my own
22:44 - personal site is just a regular
22:46 - WordPress site with WordPress
22:49 - templates um Octavian says it's too
22:52 - boring to stay longer cheers to
22:55 - everybody see see you Octavian uh I'm
22:58 - sure Octavian is not here anymore but uh
23:01 - if if parts of the video are super
23:03 - boring to any of you let me know what
23:05 - parts are boring and then I will try to
23:07 - just cut those out uh I don't mind if if
23:10 - a part's really useful and boring that's
23:12 - okay but if it's boring and it's not
23:14 - useful to anybody then yeah I just want
23:17 - to cut it out so um yeah if anybody else
23:20 - thinks it's boring before you leave
23:21 - please let me know uh what exactly is
23:24 - the boring part um XDS which project is
23:28 - that it is it's the um uh the CI react
23:33 - oh yeah you so github.com
23:35 - Fus hyphen marcom slci react the link is
23:40 - in the description for the video this
23:42 - branch is called let me let me give you
23:46 - the branch name so you could it's called
23:49 - home hyphen alt so I'm working on that
23:52 - Branch right now if you want to check
23:54 - out any of the
23:56 - code
24:04 - all
24:05 - right okay Amed says the user interface
24:08 - design looks totally stunning to me uh
24:10 - awesome
24:12 - so uh thank you I'm I'm glad you think
24:15 - that uh yeah so I mean you all that have
24:19 - been watching for a while like we we
24:20 - worked really hard on this I really
24:21 - really appreciate you saying that
24:25 - um XD says would be cool would take it
24:28 - out of
24:30 - Wordpress yeah
24:32 - um I've thought about like totally not
24:34 - having WordPress involved at all but it
24:37 - just wasn't like going with a completely
24:40 - different content management system I
24:42 - the time frame that I had for this I
24:44 - just knew I wouldn't be able to do that
24:47 - uh in this time frame but if there is a
24:49 - A system that would be more lightweight
24:51 - and still as userfriendly as WordPress
24:54 - in terms of someone with no coding
24:56 - experience being able to come come in
24:57 - and input data then I'd definitely be
25:01 - open to that specifically I would love
25:03 - it if there was
25:05 - something that was well tested and
25:08 - reliable that could run uh off of node
25:12 - and then that way I could totally cut
25:14 - out the need for any PHP knowledge uh
25:17 - and it would just be uh JavaScript you
25:19 - know across the
25:23 - board uh ibuka asks uh just to confirm
25:28 - the site is built with nextjs yes it is
25:30 - it is built with
25:33 - nextjs
25:36 - um HED says nothing is boring Jesse
25:39 - you're doing great yeah honestly if
25:41 - someone's really Advanced at this my
25:43 - videos probably would be somewhat boring
25:45 - because I mean they'd already know all
25:47 - this so unless they're here to help me
25:49 - out it's you know it's going to be it's
25:52 - going to be pretty boring so anyway uh
25:55 - as long as people are still watching
25:57 - this and they still appreciate what I'm
25:59 - doing I'm still going to do it it do I
26:01 - mean if it's boring to some people
26:02 - that's fine there are like millions of
26:04 - videos out there that they could watch
26:06 - that may be less boring to them
26:11 - um okay uh XD says put some
26:15 - configuration instructions in the read
26:16 - me yeah I definitely should uh I've
26:19 - thought that before but it's just always
26:21 - been really low on the list um initially
26:24 - because I didn't think anybody would be
26:25 - working on it but now that you all are
26:27 - helping with it that that's going to
26:29 - move higher up on my list of things to
26:34 - do John John says LOL boring this is
26:39 - supposed to be your regular day as an
26:40 - expiring developer I want to know when
26:42 - it's boring valuable info besides I
26:45 - watch this while I codes so no problems
26:47 - okay
26:48 - cool yeah that is true I mean it is
26:50 - supposed to be my regular day and
26:52 - sometimes things are boring so uh I
26:56 - guess that's the point of the video then
26:57 - if my day is boring then the video ends
26:59 - up being boring I try to pick the uh
27:03 - most interesting thing of the day that I
27:05 - will be working on to record but there
27:09 - it's not always fun stuff all right so
27:11 - I'm going to go
27:14 - um philli says thumbs down for Drupal
27:17 - and jumla yeah I agree I've used them
27:20 - both before as well I I don't of Drupal
27:23 - jumla and
27:24 - WordPress WordPress to me by far is the
27:27 - easiest one to use um they actually the
27:31 - partner site to this so this is the site
27:34 - that's more like the marketing site and
27:36 - just informational and then there's
27:37 - going to be a learning management system
27:40 - that is actually built on Drupal that's
27:42 - not ready yet but it should be ready by
27:45 - the 15th of July and when it is then I'm
27:48 - going to link to it from there that site
27:50 - is built with Drupal uh the good thing
27:52 - is I guess because we're just basically
27:55 - pulling in everything through an API if
27:57 - I I needed to pull in data from the
27:58 - learning management system uh they could
28:01 - just expose all that data through an API
28:04 - and Drupal I guess and I could pull that
28:06 - data Ino and then I wouldn't actually
28:08 - have to develop anything for Drupal so
28:11 - uh but it's nobody uh they actually
28:13 - hired an outside company uh to do that
28:16 - so I'm not directly involved in any of
28:18 - that
28:21 - [Music]
28:25 - work all right so I'm I'm going to go
28:28 - I'm going to come back to the live chat
28:30 - but I want to work on um some of this uh
28:33 - this section first I don't think it's
28:35 - going to take a long time so I'll do
28:36 - some work for I don't know like 10 or 15
28:39 - minutes on this and I'll check back in
28:40 - with the live chat hopefully we can get
28:42 - this to a point where it's it looks it's
28:44 - decently you know kind of what we want
28:47 - and uh then I'll answer all your
28:48 - questions and everything in the live
28:50 - chat uh if you can't stick around till
28:52 - the end of the video to get your
28:53 - question answered please put it in the
28:55 - comments or direct message me on Twitter
28:57 - and then I will I will answer your
28:59 - question um whenever I get a chance
29:01 - within the next few days or so all right
29:03 - so first thing let's just work on so
29:08 - these are three different components
29:09 - actually so
29:12 - this I think it's three I think this is
29:14 - a nav component this is the hero section
29:17 - and then this is the sticky nav so we'll
29:19 - be working on all three of those
29:21 - components it is possible that I made
29:23 - this one component I can't even remember
29:26 - um when I did that but we'll find out
29:28 - here uh so this is the hero
29:33 - component and let me know if I need to
29:35 - blow this up even bigger I did preview
29:37 - the video and uh the quality was not
29:41 - great so I'm going to try to be as
29:43 - descriptive as I can you know as I'm
29:45 - talking about
29:47 - this so that you can if you can't see
29:49 - the code you can at
29:51 - least uh get an idea of what's going on
29:54 - there so yeah this hero section
30:00 - yeah so I think that is two
30:03 - separate
30:08 - components so we're
30:11 - doing we're going to drop the uh Tex
30:15 - size the font size of this
30:17 - so right now it's 100 pixels and let's
30:22 - drop this
30:25 - down this is drop it down to 75 for now
30:29 - and then I actually I want to increase
30:32 - the padding at the top a bit so I'll
30:34 - make this 175 instead of
30:37 - 150
30:40 - and what because what I want to do okay
30:43 - great that will allow me to move this
30:46 - make this bigger and this bigger that
30:48 - should move down a bit and then this
30:50 - will look that that's a decent a decent
30:54 - size we'll move this up a bit yeah I
30:57 - like that that that should work for now
31:00 - sometimes it just works out well you
31:01 - just guess and it it looks all
31:03 - right
31:05 - um let's
31:07 - [Music]
31:08 - see
31:11 - margin I could do this in Dev tools too
31:13 - but these these adjustments are pretty
31:15 - straightforward
31:18 - so uh what I want to make the margin
31:25 - 83 let's move it up let's try to make
31:31 - it
31:36 - 100 there we go yeah moved it up a bit I
31:40 - actually I think I want it up even
31:44 - more I want to see how much I can get
31:47 - this up
31:48 - here without it okay that's that's much
31:52 - better there uh it's it's a little bit
31:55 - too much right now but we're going to
31:56 - shrink this a bit too so I think this
31:58 - will work uh by moving this up so we've
32:03 - actually shrunk this section Now by over
32:05 - a 100 pixels and it still
32:08 - looks you know pretty close to what it
32:11 - was before uh so looking at it now
32:14 - though we probably need to bump this
32:17 - down a bit more if we're going to make
32:20 - this bigger so let's just let's do that
32:23 - we're going to bump this down a bit more
32:24 - and we're going to shrink this and then
32:26 - then I'm to move on to some of these
32:28 - other components I think that's uh
32:31 - that's a good
32:33 - start
32:37 - so yeah let me move this make the
32:40 - padding for this
32:43 - one 200
32:47 - and if I'm going to go over this real
32:50 - quickly in case someone's not familiar
32:51 - with react and what's going on here um
32:55 - so this is a react component
32:57 - and then within this component we have
32:59 - what looks like basic
33:02 - HTML um and this is just a JavaScript
33:06 - class okay so react is is mostly just
33:08 - regular JavaScript with a little bit of
33:12 - um this this jsx is what lets us make
33:16 - the uh have the HTML kind of mixed in
33:18 - with the JavaScript and it works and
33:20 - that I mean that's just like syntactic
33:21 - sugar but really what's going on here is
33:24 - all just it's all just functions and
33:26 - classes and things it's basic JavaScript
33:28 - stuff
33:31 - so when we want to add a style to
33:34 - something we we actually put in a
33:37 - JavaScript object and that's how we can
33:39 - put inline
33:40 - CSS uh into our our jsx which is what
33:44 - this is called this this kind of mix of
33:46 - HTML and JavaScript okay so this works
33:49 - like normal um normally you do have to
33:51 - put class name uh there's an mpm module
33:54 - now installed where I don't have to use
33:56 - class name I can use class but if you're
33:57 - just working on react like for the first
33:59 - time and it's just straight up react you
34:02 - have to put class name instead of class
34:05 - okay so anything that's a reserved uh
34:07 - word in JavaScript you can't use so
34:10 - class name is one uh instead of using
34:13 - four you have to use HTML 4 those two I
34:15 - know there's probably other ones but uh
34:18 - for sure those two you have to change
34:21 - but otherwise you just make an object so
34:24 - the first
34:25 - bracket tells
34:28 - um basically the compiler that's going
34:30 - to change the jsx
34:31 - into something that browsers can handle
34:34 - it just tells it like Hey we're going to
34:36 - do some JavaScript now and then the
34:38 - second bracket is our object and then we
34:40 - put in the
34:42 - CSS uh and then we make it camel case
34:45 - instead of hyphenated like normal CSS uh
34:48 - and then you know we just add in uh
34:51 - whatever we want uh our values to be
34:54 - here and these are in uh uh you know in
34:58 - quotation marks and then we just close
35:00 - out our object and we close out our
35:02 - JavaScript and now we're right back into
35:04 - the HTML
35:06 - style uh if you want to do more than one
35:08 - since it's a JavaScript object you just
35:10 - put a comma and then you keep on going
35:12 - and you make more okay you could put a
35:13 - bunch of CSS okay now that's one way to
35:16 - do it there's another way and this is
35:18 - styled uh jsx I don't think this comes
35:23 - with react I think this comes builtin
35:25 - with next so
35:27 - if you're using nextjs this will work if
35:30 - you're using just plain react I'm I
35:32 - can't guarantee that this will work but
35:35 - you use a style tag but then you just
35:37 - add jsx in here you drop into JavaScript
35:42 - right with our bracket and then we put a
35:43 - template
35:44 - literal uh we we start a template
35:47 - literal this is a es6 thing um a
35:50 - template literal syntax uh it lets you
35:53 - basically make a string in JavaScript
35:55 - and then you can um
35:57 - put in JavaScript within that string and
35:59 - you can also have your string take up
36:02 - multiple lines and it still works uh so
36:05 - very very handy but within that then you
36:07 - just do regular CSS I mean all this CSS
36:10 - is exactly how you would do it in a
36:12 - normal CSS file then you just close out
36:15 - the template literal with your little
36:17 - back tick and I there's no way you all
36:19 - can probably see that back tick on the
36:21 - screen so sorry about that I'll try to
36:23 - make it a bit bigger um and then you
36:26 - close out
36:28 - your uh JavaScript with another bracket
36:31 - okay and that's how you do CSS in a
36:34 - react component these aren't the only
36:35 - ways there are a lot of other uh like
36:39 - modules like npm modules and things out
36:41 - there that you can download to help you
36:43 - do CSS in in your react component these
36:47 - are the ways that I've used and that I'm
36:49 - working with now I've seen like talks on
36:51 - a lot of other different ways so there
36:53 - may be better ways out
36:55 - there um
36:57 - I'm going to
36:58 - look that was a big explanation so I'm
37:01 - just going to check really quick in the
37:02 - chat to see if I lost anybody if had any
37:05 - anyone had any questions I don't want to
37:07 - lose especially the people that are
37:08 - really new to react uh I want to make
37:10 - sure that I can help you um kind of know
37:13 - what's going on as much as I
37:18 - can okay I'm not
37:21 - seeing looks
37:24 - like it looks like there's not any
37:27 - questions specifically about this in the
37:30 - live chat right now so I'm going to move
37:32 - on okay so next thing is we want to make
37:35 - this a bit smaller so I do have
37:42 - um let's see for the hero
37:45 - section I have a minimum height
37:51 - set of
37:52 - 80 uh I yeah I think I can drop that
37:55 - down I don't think I wanted to take up
37:57 - that much now uh we'll drop that down to
37:59 - 60 but then we're also going to drop our
38:02 - background size down to 60 to match
38:06 - that uh we may have to change the
38:08 - positioning here we'll see uh also the
38:11 - margin we'll just we'll see how that how
38:13 - that works
38:16 - out whoa okay I don't think I want
38:20 - it I don't know that I want it that
38:22 - small I'm not sure what do you what do
38:24 - you all think uh in this case I do have
38:28 - some some discretion here we didn't
38:30 - decide on exactly how small this section
38:32 - would get
38:35 - so I wasn't planning on it being this
38:37 - small but now that I see
38:40 - it I think it could be I mean obviously
38:43 - we'll have to position this differently
38:46 - and Shrink this up a bit too
38:51 - but I think it could be this one and
38:54 - work let me know what you think
38:59 - uh I'm I'm for now I think I'm going to
39:01 - move this over a little bit and I'm
39:03 - going to shrink this text up a bit and
39:05 - just see how it looks sorry if you hear
39:07 - anything in the background those are
39:09 - probably my kids and my wife shushing
39:11 - them so sorry about that but in case you
39:15 - missed the beginning I am working from
39:16 - home
39:17 - today also let me know uh how the the
39:21 - video quality is I expect it to not be
39:23 - that good and I'm sorry about that uh
39:25 - but let me know if it's like totally ter
39:28 - completely terrible like not worth
39:30 - continuing the video or anything like
39:32 - that I don't really think I can do
39:34 - anything about it I've set the settings
39:37 - you know pretty low if I do go any lower
39:40 - the video is going to be
39:43 - like really low quality it I just don't
39:46 - it the screen won't be the text won't be
39:48 - readable at that point at
39:50 - all um so let's I'm actually going to go
39:54 - into Dev tools for this because this is
39:56 - going to
39:57 - be I'm going to want to mess with these
40:00 - positions a
40:02 - bit so let me bring
40:09 - over move this over I don't know if it's
40:11 - worth it for me to bring over Dev tools
40:14 - uh
40:15 - because I don't know that I can zoom in
40:17 - enough for it even to be
40:25 - readable and I actually I do have I have
40:28 - media queries and stuff going on here
40:30 - too so let's let's make this bigger
40:34 - first uh because I I want to we're going
40:37 - to have to shrink it down and then just
40:39 - hit several media
40:41 - queries several break
40:44 - points so right now all I'm changing is
40:47 - that background position X so I'm just
40:51 - hitting the down arrow key on my
40:53 - keyboard to change that background
40:55 - position and
40:57 - and I'm wondering like do I shrink this
41:02 - so that the whole thing fits or do I
41:05 - just leave it so that it's really big
41:07 - like this and and partially
41:10 - blocked I don't really I don't know the
41:12 - answer to that right now I'm I'm
41:17 - wondering maybe I can we'll shrink it a
41:20 - [Music]
41:22 - bit I think like the largess of it has a
41:25 - good impact even cuz even if it's off
41:28 - the screen you can't see it it still
41:31 - appears like it's large you know that
41:32 - part of it's obscured but you can still
41:34 - get like this this size um so I kind of
41:39 - like
41:44 - that I don't know that that looks okay
41:47 - for now oh um I'm going to copy over
41:50 - what I did now and then that way you
41:52 - you'll be able to see it so in depth in
41:56 - Chrome Dev
41:58 - tools I made some of these
42:01 - adjustments and so basically we just
42:03 - dropped down the the X position the Y
42:05 - position and then I change the
42:08 - background size from 60 to
42:14 - 49 and this is 49 viewport width so the
42:19 - the size of the background is actually
42:23 - dependent on the width of the screen so
42:25 - it's it's kind of gives it uh
42:28 - responsiveness uh so it scales nicely so
42:32 - you can see like it's obviously smaller
42:34 - at this point now we're also hitting
42:35 - some media queries so that's that's
42:38 - potentially changing the size but I
42:40 - don't think right there yeah that break
42:42 - Point's not changing the size it's just
42:46 - changing the
42:50 - positioning all right see so we do have
42:52 - some really weird stuff happening at
42:54 - some points now
42:57 - that we'll need to work out now I don't
42:59 - know that it will work all that out on
43:01 - this
43:07 - video but just basically and uh at this
43:10 - point we've hit another breakpoint so I
43:13 - want to change it because that's
43:14 - obviously not working I don't want it to
43:17 - be up that
43:25 - high
43:30 - so goodness that's yeah that starts to
43:34 - look terrible when you get down lower we
43:36 - have to figure something out uh but
43:38 - that's okay so I'm going to
43:40 - change this break point so this 1200
43:44 - pixel
43:46 - breako instead of
43:48 - 26% for the uh background position y I'm
43:53 - going to change that to negative
43:57 - 32%
44:07 - oops and an easy fix that we might do so
44:13 - this component actually doesn't display
44:14 - at all once we get small enough
44:18 - screen
44:25 - so we could instead of trying to mess
44:28 - with all of this we could
44:31 - just make it go away I mean this is
44:34 - depending
44:35 - on on how it
44:39 - looks I think it does make sense that
44:42 - probably at the point where the logo
44:45 - gets
44:47 - centered at that point this hero section
44:50 - should go
44:54 - away and so that's
44:56 - 900 900 or
45:01 - so looks like
45:05 - 992 so we'll set
45:09 - this
45:12 - 992 and this this media uh query
45:15 - controls when that is displayed right so
45:18 - I didn't
45:19 - want for users with small screens
45:22 - they're most likely on a mobile
45:24 - device
45:27 - so when this I didn't want them to one
45:30 - have to load a large image here and have
45:32 - a huge section to have to scroll down uh
45:36 - down that section so let's
45:40 - see all right that works we also have to
45:44 - adjust our media query now for the nav
45:46 - component to make it display at that
45:49 - that
45:51 - range all right I'm going to check the
45:54 - live chat again just really quickly
46:01 - okay Ahmed says uh aled probably already
46:04 - left so I don't know if he'll hear this
46:06 - or not but he said he's got to go
46:08 - because the time in India is 12:43 a.m.
46:11 - so got to get some sleep totally
46:13 - understand that uh so I'll see you um
46:16 - hopefully next week I can get some
46:17 - streams in uh at a decent quality from
46:20 - my office uh thanks for watching
46:24 - ahed
46:27 - let's
46:32 - see all right looks like there's some
46:34 - good conversation going on in the live
46:35 - chat but it doesn't look like a lot is
46:37 - directed at me in terms of questions
46:40 - so oh okay it looks like uh XD said the
46:43 - resolution is is cool it's
46:47 - so
46:48 - cool Umberto says uh Umberto likes how
46:52 - it looks partially blocked so so this
46:55 - monit so maybe maybe we will uh increase
46:57 - the size and just let it be a little bit
46:58 - blocked I'm I'm with you there I think
47:01 - it you still get the sense that it's
47:04 - large even though you can't see all of
47:05 - it and since it's I mean it's basically
47:07 - a symmetrical thing so you can you can
47:09 - get even if you've never seen this is
47:11 - called a monstr even if you've never
47:13 - seen one
47:14 - before you can basically guess that it's
47:16 - going to continue to be a
47:18 - circle um I mean I don't I have seen one
47:21 - before and I've seen this whole image
47:23 - but it seems to me like the shape of it
47:27 - you know suggests basically that it
47:29 - keeps going around anyway
47:33 - so I'll work on that a
47:39 - bit uh Sean ask as what I was creating
47:43 - because just came on uh basically I'm
47:46 - I'm editing this this section used to be
47:48 - really big like a big hero section and
47:50 - we're shrinking it down uh to make it
47:52 - much shorter and so we need to make a
47:55 - lot of a adjustments here with the size
47:56 - of the image and the font size and you
47:59 - know how they're they're um displayed um
48:03 - their
48:10 - positioning uh Alberto says uh are you
48:13 - not using the hide on materialized
48:15 - classes yeah
48:18 - so uh if you've if you've been watching
48:20 - or you might have noticed in the code
48:22 - I'm using materialize as my framework
48:25 - for my
48:27 - Styles and there are already classes to
48:30 - hide and show things and
48:31 - materialize I didn't use those classes
48:34 - before
48:37 - because
48:39 - um I I had like custom break points that
48:42 - I wanted to use they didn't match up
48:44 - with the break points that were already
48:45 - built in although at this point I
48:49 - probably could switch to those because I
48:52 - think our break points are actually
48:54 - starting to align
48:56 - so originally the break points weren't
48:59 - lined up but now I think like this break
49:01 - point here does match up with the
49:05 - materialized break points
49:09 - so that's probably a good idea what
49:11 - would that be hide on I think that would
49:13 - be hide on medium and down let's do that
49:17 - that's certainly like a much cleaner way
49:19 - to do it so I'm going to try this so
49:22 - instead of having our showing and hiding
49:26 - this in some CSS that we've written
49:29 - we're going to try to use the
49:30 - class hide on medium and down so I think
49:36 - that's how it
49:38 - goes if it doesn't work at all then I'll
49:40 - look it up but I'm pretty sure that's
49:43 - the uh the way you write it and then
49:47 - let's take out so we won't need this
49:51 - actually we we'll probably I'll leave
49:53 - this Max height thing in
49:58 - because they don't have a a
50:02 - height uh class built in all right so
50:06 - let me save that and this should still
50:14 - hide
50:16 - whoops oh did I start the video
50:19 - accidentally started the video I keep
50:20 - doing that all the time I might just
50:22 - take the video out while I'm working so
50:23 - I quit accidentally starting it all
50:27 - right so it should disappear nice it did
50:29 - Umberto awesome suggestion so now we're
50:32 - not going to worry about doing our break
50:35 - points manually uh we're going to use
50:38 - the uh now that our break points are
50:41 - actually lining up with the built-in
50:43 - once we materialized we can just use
50:45 - those
50:46 - classes uh so that's cool let
50:50 - me let's
50:54 - see
50:55 - I'm going to check the live chat really
50:57 - quick some
51:00 - questions um Isaiah asked how are you
51:04 - structuring your code I think in CSS
51:06 - it's easy to have unorganized code yeah
51:07 - for sure it is in my CSS right now is so
51:10 - if you look if you check out the repo
51:13 - and look at my style.css file it's a
51:15 - mess it's really like the reason that
51:19 - it's a mess there's two reasons why it's
51:21 - why it's a mess so all this was
51:23 - originally built in with SAS and then
51:25 - just converted over to CSS so this isn't
51:29 - really how I wrote it you know this is
51:31 - the converted version so it's a little
51:33 - bit messed up because of that the other
51:35 - reason is uh I had intended most of this
51:39 - to actually live in the components so I
51:41 - didn't bother trying to organize it that
51:43 - much because I always figured well I'm
51:45 - just going to move this over into all
51:46 - the components at some point anyway I
51:48 - have slowly been moving things over but
51:52 - I haven't obviously I have not moved
51:54 - everything over
51:56 - so uh at some point I'd like to move it
51:59 - into the components but it's just not
52:01 - happening yet actually if anybody um if
52:05 - you really want to get
52:09 - some
52:10 - um I don't know like some pool requests
52:14 - accepted on GitHub just to like build up
52:15 - your portfolio maybe you're like uh want
52:19 - to want it to look a little bit more
52:20 - impressive for a job or something feel
52:22 - free to take that on to even if it's you
52:25 - just want to move a little bit over and
52:27 - that's cool as long as everything still
52:28 - works I'll definitely accept that pull
52:30 - request uh otherwise I might have saved
52:32 - some of this I have a student worker
52:34 - right now and I'm hopefully going to
52:36 - have some more student workers from the
52:38 - computer science department this might
52:40 - be a really good thing to just start
52:42 - them out with so that they get used to
52:46 - you know submitting pool requests and
52:48 - just some basic stuff uh cuz they're
52:50 - really knowledgeable about a lot of
52:53 - computer science things but not really
52:55 - about web development
52:58 - so kind of they need to be brought in
53:01 - with like little Little
53:03 - Steps so anyway I fully acknowledge that
53:07 - my CSS is a mess right now and I
53:09 - acknowledge that that is not
53:15 - ideal um XTS do you have media queries
53:18 - for all sizes
53:20 - um not really I
53:23 - don't I don't know I'd have to look I
53:25 - didn't I don't think I'm using that many
53:26 - media queries but maybe I
53:29 - am uh as I was doing this I was trying
53:31 - to go really fast uh like before launch
53:34 - so I think I did get sloppy with my
53:36 - media queries at some point so I
53:39 - probably do have a lot of them more than
53:41 - I
53:42 - need
53:44 - um XD ask about CSS pre-processors yes
53:48 - so I did use SAS but I'm not right
53:51 - now uh Patrick says the um the white bar
53:56 - at the top he's asking about the white
53:58 - bar so basically what happened is with
54:00 - that white bar is so like you can see
54:03 - here you can kind of see the nav here I
54:05 - have to adjust some stuff so this
54:06 - actually shows up but the nav's there
54:09 - and then it disappears because I have a
54:11 - media query to hide it at this point I
54:15 - just need to adjust it so when I
54:18 - adjusted the media query for this
54:23 - section it made it disappear here so
54:25 - there's this like basically from this
54:28 - wide to this wide there's this space now
54:30 - where there's nothing here so I just
54:32 - need to make the the thinner version of
54:35 - the nav appear there so when I go over
54:39 - it to edit we're about I'm about to edit
54:41 - that component now so I'll uh change
54:44 - that in a second and then that'll work
54:47 - um XD says you can you can split it man
54:49 - are you talking about my
54:50 - CSS yeah uh and use one style sheet for
54:54 - component yeah yeah that was my that was
54:57 - my plan that was my plan to do it so
55:00 - originally this site was actually just a
55:02 - static HTML site it was not react and
55:05 - that's where the majority of the styles
55:07 - were made in SAS for that site so that's
55:10 - why it was just one
55:12 - stylesheet like I said the idea was to
55:15 - split it up when it became a react site
55:18 - it just
55:19 - had it just hasn't happened as fast as I
55:22 - uh as I wanted
55:23 - to um
55:27 - let's
55:35 - see okay so XD sent said uh a PR send a
55:40 - PR trying to change it uh all that stuff
55:43 - thank you I appreciate that I'll check
55:44 - that out after the
55:46 - video yeah okay so Joshua says you need
55:49 - to add the SAS loader to your webpack
55:51 - config yes so
55:55 - when I first started working with nextjs
55:58 - that wasn't you couldn't do custom
56:01 - configs for webpack so this was like I
56:05 - don't know we're like almost on version
56:07 - three for next something like that this
56:09 - was like way back like pre version two
56:11 - you couldn't do that so when I started
56:14 - this project I would just assume that I
56:17 - couldn't do it and then after IID
56:19 - started it I realized that you could now
56:21 - do custom webpack configs but at that
56:24 - point point I had
56:26 - already like I was already in the middle
56:28 - of it and I thought you know what I
56:29 - don't I don't even care at this point
56:30 - I'm just going to keep going with it but
56:32 - yeah you you can add the assass loader
56:36 - in um and next let you do that now and
56:40 - uh so it's definitely possible and it
56:42 - would be
56:46 - better let's see yeah so xd's laughing
56:51 - at me in the live chat here because I
56:52 - have one file for all the Styles yeah
56:55 - um I mean there are actually a lot of
56:57 - styles within the components now too
57:00 - so technically I have many files but I
57:03 - only have one CSS
57:06 - file uh all right so the only thing I
57:10 - think I really need to do now before I
57:12 - move on to the nav component is make
57:15 - sure that this text doesn't overlap the
57:17 - logo
57:19 - and I just need to make this text a lot
57:22 - smaller so I'm going to have
57:25 - go into Dev tools
57:26 - [Music]
57:28 - on my other screen here and then at
57:31 - least you can
57:34 - see
57:38 - H yeah I don't it needs to be I think
57:42 - like at least that
57:44 - big it just looks way too small
57:47 - otherwise
57:51 - so all right let's go with that and
57:57 - move it down a
58:01 - bit I tell you the truth I'm I don't
58:03 - really like how that looks right
58:06 - now I think that looks
58:11 - bad yeah I mean look that's that looks
58:18 - terrible I don't know what do you think
58:20 - I think that looks really
58:23 - bad
58:27 - uh Joshua asked about nextjs said it you
58:30 - made it sound similar to create react
58:32 - react create app uh yeah it is it's
58:34 - basically does the same thing as that it
58:36 - just adds some other things like
58:39 - um uh mainly the biggest reason I use
58:42 - next instead of uh the create react app
58:48 - is server side
58:50 - rendering because that comes built in
58:52 - with
58:53 - next also the routing is helpful I I've
58:57 - learned how to do routing with react
58:58 - router since then but at first I didn't
59:01 - I wasn't that great with routing and
59:03 - react so the fact that next had built-in
59:06 - routing was also a big plus all right
59:09 - so I we need to do something with this
59:12 - I'm going to bring up I'm going to bring
59:15 - up the live site as a
59:21 - reference yeah something needs to happen
59:23 - because this looks really balance
59:26 - now
59:35 - so I think we
59:38 - need maybe this needs to come over a bit
59:42 - maybe be bigger there's just so much
59:45 - space and I'm wondering
59:48 - why why is this on three lines maybe I
59:53 - um
60:00 - okay so if you can see on the screen I
60:02 - have it in this
60:11 - container so that's part of the problem
60:14 - is that the container that it's in is
60:16 - making it that
60:17 - small we might be able to get away we'll
60:21 - see let me know what you think about
60:22 - this but we could probably get away with
60:24 - making this even
60:26 - shorter and then having this line just
60:30 - be like a line across the bottom
60:36 - here I'm not sure I kind of I kind of
60:39 - want to see how it would
60:41 - look I'm not 100% convinced that that
60:44 - would be the right way to do
60:48 - it but I think it's worth a
60:53 - shot
60:56 - so to make that happen I'm probably
60:58 - going to have to change a little bit of
61:00 - the
61:01 - HTML I mean I can I can just mess with
61:04 - it here
61:05 - but if I really wanted it to work I'll
61:08 - have to change the structure a
61:23 - bit
61:26 - yeah so let me I was trying to just
61:28 - change it in Dev tools but there's too
61:30 - much too much that needs change so you
61:32 - can see how I have this now is I
61:34 - actually have it uh inside like a column
61:37 - class so um so we have it in a row and
61:42 - then in a column and we need to separate
61:44 - that out so you can see like this is the
61:47 - column which I've I've messed around
61:49 - with in Dev tools and then the row but
61:52 - the row is really restricting it
61:55 - down to this side so I can't go over so
61:58 - we need to completely just take it out
61:59 - of the row uh so we can position it
62:03 - however we
62:06 - want
62:09 - so I do want to
62:12 - keep basically I just need to keep this
62:15 - H1 so let's take that out and then
62:19 - everything within this
62:21 - row we get rid of
62:27 - and we'll just pop this in here oh man
62:31 - wow
62:33 - that that's
62:35 - terrible I mean we are whenever we save
62:39 - a commit it'll reformat this anyway but
62:41 - so I guess it's not a big deal also we
62:45 - had
62:47 - the I'll see if this works we might have
62:49 - to the text might revert to being
62:53 - black yeah yeah it looks like it did so
62:56 - let me add the
63:05 - class white
63:11 - text there we go okay so now we have it
63:15 - to the point where we can at least
63:19 - see the only problem with doing it this
63:22 - way is like at some point
63:26 - we're going to have to make even further
63:28 - adjustments right
63:30 - because it's just too big I mean maybe
63:33 - we could decrease the font size a bit so
63:35 - that we wouldn't have to worry so that
63:37 - would like it would never hit I mean
63:39 - we're close right now I just never want
63:42 - there to be an overlap uh over top of
63:46 - this image
63:47 - so need some
63:53 - adjustment
64:00 - at this point I'm thinking like I
64:02 - probably could have just completely
64:03 - redone this this whole section and not
64:05 - just tried to adjust
64:07 - it uh
64:09 - but let's at least you know do a do a
64:13 - little bit of adjustment here just to
64:14 - get a good visual of what what it could
64:18 - be
64:20 - and let's
64:23 - make
64:25 - make this
64:41 - shorter all right that's good for
64:44 - now
64:46 - and let's move this
64:53 - down
65:11 - okay and I definitely want to move this
65:20 - over okay um all right so that give us
65:24 - like a rough idea of where this
65:26 - potentially could
65:29 - be
65:31 - so I'm GNA just look at this for a
65:35 - second you all can check it out as
65:38 - well let me know what you think I mean
65:41 - basically we're going from from
65:45 - this let's break them out so we can see
65:47 - the side by
65:50 - side and we've kind of made it really I
65:54 - guess
65:57 - extreme change
66:00 - here you know
66:06 - originally so originally I wasn't
66:08 - thinking it would be that
66:17 - extreme all right so uh the delay on the
66:20 - video should be up so hopefully I'll be
66:22 - getting some feed
66:26 - feedback okay feedback is is it is kind
66:30 - of weird
66:36 - um okay so I'm going back now on the
66:40 - live chat and checking out some of the
66:51 - feedback okay so Matt says can make the
66:55 - the logo in the upper left larger and uh
66:58 - vertically Center it okay
67:03 - um Philip asks is that an image or text
67:05 - in the center um if you're talking about
67:08 - this this is actually text so You' asked
67:11 - that a while ago so
67:15 - maybe maybe you figured that
67:19 - out there we go okay so Justin had said
67:22 - you could make it make it one
67:27 - line okay Matt agrees on line would be
67:33 - better Matt also says I have to admit I
67:35 - don't like the react inline Styles I'm
67:37 - so excited to move from inline styling
67:40 - to CSS I can't believe we're moving back
67:42 - to inline and popularity yeah I know it
67:45 - is really weird it was really weird when
67:46 - I saw it at first too because that's how
67:49 - I don't know I mean I had everything
67:51 - always said like don't use inline CS
67:54 - but um the I I've I'm on board with it
67:59 - now because of the con just being having
68:02 - everything being modular and reusable
68:04 - like
68:05 - be if I can make my components so
68:08 - self-contained to the point where I
68:10 - could just pull one component off of one
68:12 - project and pop it into another project
68:14 - and it would look the same and behave
68:16 - the same that is super valuable uh so I
68:21 - really like that that aspect of it
68:24 - especially if I could just with a few
68:26 - things adjust the styles to match like a
68:30 - new color scheme but basically
68:31 - everything else would be able to stay
68:33 - the same I think that's valuable and for
68:37 - me at least that helped me to get over
68:40 - the weirdness of it of putting the
68:42 - Styles you know in
68:48 - line okay Matt says the the logo in the
68:51 - upper left needs to have size increased
68:53 - to match the other two elements in the
68:54 - scope it barely registers on the screen
68:56 - with the other elements that's exactly
68:58 - what everyone was saying in the meeting
69:00 - yesterday so that was the the whole
69:02 - point of decreasing this stuff was so
69:04 - that this didn't get lost so yeah you're
69:08 - you're right on target that's what that
69:11 - was the General consensus
69:13 - yesterday John says if you use flex
69:16 - Direction column div inside your header
69:18 - within a flex div row you would have
69:20 - much more responsive control without
69:22 - playing with the margins Etc also the
69:26 - remm font size can tie well to
69:28 - responsive width okay I
69:32 - will now when when I am using the flex
69:35 - stuff
69:37 - though uh how back this support go for
69:41 - that I am using Flex in some other areas
69:42 - of site so I'm not super concerned about
69:45 - the support for it uh but I do I have
69:48 - noticed that like
69:50 - i1 just when I use flex with i1 it
69:54 - doesn't it doesn't look right
69:58 - so I don't know is anyone has experience
70:01 - with that I mean I'm not super worried
70:03 - about it there's not that many people
70:05 - that that even view the site with ie11
70:09 - but if I if it's not too difficult to
70:13 - support it I would like to support
70:15 - it so let's
70:19 - work let me let me just see if I can
70:21 - make this bigger since we've had a few
70:23 - suggestions about making this bigger uh
70:25 - I just want to
70:28 - see what it would look
70:34 - like so let's make this a bit bigger oh
70:38 - actually yeah that doesn't look bad at
70:39 - all I don't know
70:41 - what what size that
70:44 - is uh originally but it looks
70:48 - good oh yeah it's definitely big enough
70:51 - we can make that bigger
70:54 - um
70:58 - [Music]
71:04 - awesome oh okay so uh i11 does have 98%
71:09 - support that's
71:12 - cool and that was uh John John just
71:15 - informed me about that XD saying you can
71:17 - use webkit
71:19 - prefixes okay cool yeah the the main
71:22 - thing that I've noticed breaks in i1 is
71:25 - uh when I try to vertically align things
71:28 - with
71:32 - flexbox maybe that's like the one thing
71:34 - that's not
71:36 - supported but yeah actually that that
71:41 - logo looks a lot better uh when it's
71:44 - bigger like that so I'm I'm going to
71:46 - bring that over and currently this the
71:49 - styles for that logo currently live in
71:52 - the style.css so this is going to be an
71:54 - instance where we
71:56 - can move that into the component so this
71:59 - is going to be in the nav
72:02 - component
72:05 - and let's find it's the brand
72:09 - logo
72:11 - so we can put
72:20 - it oops no I don't want to class I want
72:22 - to
72:24 - I want an inline
72:38 - style
72:40 - um and then I definitely want to remove
72:43 - this in the CSS so assuming that this
72:45 - does look all
72:48 - right and let me
72:50 - move I'm GNA get rid of this we don't
72:52 - need that right now
72:56 - dang
72:58 - it I keep clicking this accidentally
73:03 - um yeah that looks good let me
73:09 - do okay
73:11 - I I think that that looks all right so
73:14 - let's go to um we'll take a little chunk
73:17 - out of this giant unorganized CSS file
73:21 - here so
73:24 - it feels really good every time I get to
73:25 - delete something out of this
73:38 - file so line
73:40 - 208 oh man we
73:47 - got I forgot I had some media queries
73:50 - associated with it as
73:52 - well
73:56 - all right so I will have to include
73:58 - these so let's grab
74:05 - this wow I got a lot of
74:13 - stuff I while we're
74:15 - here why don't I just grab all the nav
74:22 - stuff and then I can just get rid of it
74:25 - from this
74:29 - file I didn't even realize I had this
74:34 - much all right
74:43 - so now the the formatting is insane
74:49 - like like I said this not usually how I
74:52 - format CSS this was just the auto uh
74:55 - formatting oops going to move it to our
74:58 - component so you have the nav component
75:01 - here uh I'll leave that here just for
75:03 - now but I am going to take that out and
75:05 - down
75:08 - below it looks like I had already
75:10 - transferred some stuff over here so we
75:12 - may have to clean it
75:20 - up uh I want in case I've done something
75:23 - here that I was overriding I'm going to
75:26 - put all the new styles on top so that
75:29 - when it Cascades
75:31 - um it should still all work and then I
75:34 - can always clean that up if there's any
75:37 - duplicates
75:40 - so the only thing that I need to change
75:43 - right now is this
75:50 - height nope not that height
75:54 - the uh logo
76:03 - height so brand logo image height needs
76:07 - to be
76:11 - 130 and now I can remove this the reason
76:14 - I didn't want to keep this here is
76:16 - because this would overwrite everything
76:17 - in the media queries and I need that
76:21 - so I'm going to save
76:23 - that I guess I could check quickly to
76:26 - make
76:27 - sure all right well that's nothing
76:30 - nothing change
76:32 - significantly
76:34 - so that's
76:36 - cool that
76:37 - works uh
76:40 - now let's remove all this stuff from the
76:44 - style styles.
76:52 - CSS
76:56 - oh yes that felt so good to get rid of
76:59 - that so so see I'm cutting down on it
77:03 - here all right I'm going to check back
77:06 - in the live chat
77:12 - quickly okay uh John said that uh his
77:16 - most recent site is all flex and with
77:19 - ie1 it's good so maybe um
77:29 - maybe the maybe I need to just go back
77:31 - and make sure that I do have the correct
77:34 - uh vendor prefixes and
77:37 - things says it looks looks so
77:39 - complicated yeah it I know it
77:45 - does um I feel like every time I go back
77:48 - to this file someone else uh comments
77:51 - about how how messy it is but it is it's
77:54 - true it is really messy it was never
77:56 - supposed to be like that
77:59 - um sometimes you just have to do things
78:01 - to get a site
78:03 - launched and then you clean it up
78:05 - later um that was the case in case you
78:09 - haven't seen like the whole thing and
78:11 - the story of this site quick recap is
78:14 - this was a totally unexpected project
78:17 - that I got assigned to like one day I
78:20 - was working on something and all of a
78:23 - sudden it was like drop everything do
78:25 - this project and the completion date was
78:28 - like it was just a really really tight
78:30 - deadline and um
78:33 - so a lot a lot of the
78:36 - stuff some of the stuff that's not
78:39 - really a great practice in the code is
78:41 - entire it's entirely possible that it's
78:43 - just because of my lack of of knowledge
78:46 - of the right way to do it but some of
78:48 - the stuff CSS included was simply
78:51 - because I just it just needed to get
78:54 - done
78:56 - so it was like you know what I I need
78:59 - this done like I'm just going to type it
79:01 - out and I'll have time later so there
79:04 - were a lot of points where it was like
79:05 - I'll have time later to clean this up
79:08 - and now is really that later so um so
79:12 - that's why I'm doing it
79:14 - now although I do appreciate everybody
79:17 - saying that I should clean it up so I'm
79:19 - not I'm not mad about it but I'm I'm
79:21 - just saying I I agree you don't have to
79:24 - convince me that it should be cleaned up
79:27 - um all right so what else did we want to
79:32 - change in
79:33 - here not
79:35 - hero um we wanted to make
79:39 - that The
79:42 - Branding
79:44 - text bigger where where is
79:49 - that I think it's here okay yeah it's
79:52 - here here uh
79:55 - so if you're not sure this outlink this
79:58 - is uh from a few um a few streams ago uh
80:03 - we made a component uh
80:07 - that basically fixed a bug in react GA
80:12 - that let us do click tracking with
80:14 - outbound links and open them up in a new
80:16 - tab so that's why this is the outlink
80:18 - component uh so you can check out that
80:21 - that video and um and the code for that
80:24 - if if you're interested but that's why
80:26 - it's not just your know a regular link
80:29 - tag uh so for
80:32 - this I think
80:35 - I we'll just do this in Dev tools first
80:38 - just to get an idea of what it's going
80:39 - to look
80:43 - like do I not
80:45 - have I actually don't think I even have
80:47 - a font size set for this this is just
80:49 - the default font
80:51 - size
81:02 - interesting all right so let's
81:07 - see this is up
81:09 - from it's just a a bit
81:13 - bigger
81:15 - 18 it's 18
81:17 - pixels let's try to go
81:20 - 20 20 doesn't look too bad I do think it
81:23 - needs a bit more room at the
81:33 - top I mean it's not bad I don't want it
81:35 - I don't want this to be
81:37 - overwhelming so I think if we just move
81:39 - it down a bit bump it up to 20
81:44 - pixels I think that'll work especially
81:46 - since this this is smaller now we'll
81:49 - probably go a bit smaller with that
81:51 - font I think that's
81:59 - decent so let me find that i' I've given
82:02 - this a class of uh Fus
82:05 - branding um so we'll just move this I I
82:09 - did change this
82:11 - to 16 and we'll
82:17 - add
82:20 - W the indentation stuff is crazy I
82:25 - need I had a package for Adam that was
82:27 - Auto indenting everything for me and it
82:29 - was awesome but it was messing up the um
82:33 - so we're using prettier and then so it
82:36 - was messing up stuff with prettier so
82:39 - that basically like it was changing the
82:42 - positioning in all my files and it would
82:46 - look like I had something to commit to
82:48 - get when all that had happened is my
82:51 - atom plugin had changed the formatting
82:54 - from what prettier had made it and it
82:56 - just kept flipping back and forth so I
82:57 - disabled it but now my my auto indenting
83:00 - is gone so I have to sort that
83:08 - out all
83:12 - right if you heard that that was my the
83:15 - I have an eight Monon old and that was
83:17 - her in the background yelling yelling
83:20 - for me so
83:24 - um
83:32 - okay so let's make this a bit
83:38 - smaller this is starting I mean this is
83:41 - getting to the point where I think it's
83:44 - close also there's just like there's a
83:47 - little weirdness of I've gotten used to
83:50 - the so used to the other one anything I
83:51 - do now is going to look weird at first
83:53 - to me so once I get over
83:57 - that uh I think I'll be able to look at
84:00 - this a bit more objectively and see
84:02 - whether or not it's it
84:04 - works uh but I think
84:07 - that maybe just a bit smaller on that
84:10 - size and
84:12 - then maybe move it down a
84:18 - little yeah and I think that'll
84:21 - work
84:39 - [Music]
84:46 - okay
84:51 - um
84:54 - yeah that's not too bad let me know what
84:56 - you think in the live chat if you
84:57 - haven't
85:01 - already oh awesome Patrick just said in
85:04 - the live chat uh they have a prettier
85:06 - atom
85:07 - plugin that's great I'll um I'll have to
85:11 - check that out oh aim high joined us hey
85:14 - how's it
85:17 - going uh aimh High say I just followed
85:19 - you on Twitter awesome so
85:22 - yeah I'll definitely um I'll check that
85:25 - out uh in I think the last stream or one
85:29 - of our recent streams uh a high said uh
85:34 - like told us about a job a new job so
85:37 - did you start yet uh or were you
85:40 - starting I can't remember if you said
85:42 - when you were going to start or not if
85:43 - you did start how is
85:50 - it all right umber to say it almost
85:52 - seems like there needs to be something
85:54 - in the space to the right of the brand
85:56 - to balance out the slogan but it might
85:59 - be
86:04 - weird yeah I'm with you like it it
86:09 - just it does look a little weird maybe
86:11 - if I move this in and make it bigger
86:14 - it'll
86:16 - balance a
86:20 - bit yeah I'll let me try that uh let me
86:24 - make sure I bring
86:25 - over the changes that I
86:31 - made
86:36 - and let
86:51 - see
87:21 - for
87:24 - [Music]
87:26 - oh okay amh high is going to start on
87:27 - Monday the 3 all right well good
87:32 - luck I hope everything is uh is awesome
87:36 - at your new job super excited about
87:40 - that oh Isaiah asks why is it better to
87:44 - convert the website to
87:45 - reactjs
87:47 - so um while I'm adjusting the size here
87:50 - I'll talk a little bit about that
87:52 - um
87:54 - reacts so react has a lot of advantages
87:58 - um in this case for me converting it
88:03 - from a static site to
88:06 - react uh meant that it was going to be a
88:09 - lot easier for me to import the data uh
88:14 - so on a
88:17 - static if so I wanted to import the data
88:21 - from
88:23 - uh from WordPress that was the plan all
88:24 - along the static site was like a backup
88:26 - plan to say okay well there's the
88:29 - deadlines really tight it's way faster
88:31 - for me to just code all this out than to
88:33 - either try to make a WordPress theme or
88:36 - make the react site that I eventually
88:37 - wanted to so that was just kind of the
88:40 - backup plan that I know I could get this
88:42 - out but the problem with that is if you
88:44 - wanted to update that static site I had
88:46 - to go in and update it in the
88:49 - code there are people there are like
88:51 - student work workers who work for the
88:53 - kakal Institute that need to be able to
88:55 - update it and they don't have any
88:57 - experience with code so I need the the
88:59 - content needed to come from a Content
89:00 - management system
89:02 - so with react I can easily build a
89:06 - component uh and those components can
89:11 - then
89:14 - uh I can render all the data into those
89:16 - components specifically when I'm using
89:18 - nextjs I can pull in the data and render
89:21 - it service side so then it's great for
89:23 - search engine
89:24 - optimization uh if I were to just like
89:27 - try to turn my static site and like do
89:30 - some custom you know JavaScript
89:32 - templates for that uh and pull that in
89:36 - client side I would have no search
89:38 - engine optimization all right uh and
89:41 - just so for me specifically those were a
89:44 - big deal but this in general react is
89:47 - really a nice way to do things um
89:50 - especially if you need
89:54 - like if you need things to happen on
89:55 - your site where there's going to be
89:56 - changes to the Dom instead of doing it
89:58 - all with jQuery which is what people I
90:01 - guess would normally do um react has a
90:04 - different way of doing things and it
90:05 - keeps like this alternate version of the
90:08 - Dom and it compares the two to only
90:12 - change things that need change instead
90:14 - of rendering everything so you end up
90:16 - getting better
90:18 - performance uh when things change on
90:21 - your site
90:22 - um the other things too like it does
90:25 - client side routing you know nicely so
90:27 - you notice like you click around on this
90:29 - site uh there's not page refreshes so
90:33 - there's just so many uh cool things that
90:37 - react does really well and it's not that
90:39 - you couldn't do it like I it's not that
90:42 - I couldn't have done all that stuff with
90:43 - a static site but it would have been
90:46 - really complicated for me to do it on my
90:48 - own and then trying for somebody else to
90:51 - try to keep up with that would have been
90:52 - insane like you know if I made my own
90:56 - custom routing solution and all that it
90:59 - uh and and I probably would have done it
91:02 - given the time frame I would have used
91:05 - uh jQuery so it would have been very
91:07 - hard to
91:09 - maintain I'm sure there's other benefits
91:11 - to react to that I'm just I'm forgetting
91:13 - or that I don't know
91:14 - about
91:16 - but I can't find in Dev tools this uh
91:19 - background there we go finally
91:23 - uh
91:26 - so let's move this
91:31 - in a
91:34 - bit and make it
91:43 - bigger and
91:45 - then let's move it back over a bit
91:50 - now just thinking if we do it like this
91:53 - I'll probably bring that
92:08 - down I was hoping that that would make
92:11 - it seem like there I mean there's
92:13 - definitely not as much space there but
92:14 - it still doesn't exactly look
92:20 - right to be honest with you if I could
92:22 - just lose the
92:25 - tagline I think it would look fine but I
92:28 - can't like there there's no way they'll
92:29 - let me take the tagline
92:31 - out I would actually love to get rid of
92:34 - the tagline because then I wouldn't have
92:36 - to import this font which I only import
92:38 - for this
92:45 - tagline if anyone can think of a better
92:47 - place to put this
92:50 - tagline that's still appears near the
92:53 - top let me know
92:56 - because that that I think is really
92:59 - what's causing the issue for us right
93:00 - now is that this is just kind of like
93:20 - odd
93:24 - all right so I am going to save the few
93:26 - things that I did
93:32 - here
93:35 - and definitely need to think about that
93:38 - tagline some
93:39 - more so I'm probably going to wrap up
93:42 - the video soon um definitely significant
93:46 - change here but I'm to a point now where
93:49 - I think I really just need to think
93:51 - about
93:52 - I don't know about you but when I get
93:54 - like I like to mess around like this but
93:56 - at some point like I just need to close
93:58 - my eyes and like picture what this is
94:00 - going to look like and sometimes I
94:03 - actually just like JW it use a pen and
94:05 - paper and JW it down and sometimes
94:07 - that's better than just continuing to
94:10 - make
94:11 - adjustments uh and I think I'm getting
94:13 - to that point where I need to just kind
94:15 - of visualize what this could
94:19 - be I don't think it it's not
94:22 - terrible
94:23 - but I I don't you know this is the
94:26 - homepage this the first thing people are
94:28 - going to see I wanted to look really
94:30 - really good uh and this just to me does
94:33 - not look really good
94:36 - so so I'm going to finish up with the
94:39 - actual like CSS changes here I'm going
94:41 - to go back to the live chat I'm going to
94:43 - go through and try to answer all the
94:44 - questions I can so if you have a
94:46 - question throw it in there now and then
94:47 - I'm going to just I'm going to wrap it
94:49 - up I know I said the beginning I didn't
94:50 - want this to be a super long video and
94:52 - it has ended up being a pretty long
94:55 - video um I really I just kind of didn't
94:57 - want to have this giant video that was
95:00 - of low low quality but I guess too late
95:05 - for that so I'm going to I'm going to
95:07 - scroll back up to the top of the live
95:09 - chat now and uh I'll tell you the uh the
95:13 - chat has gone on long enough that I have
95:15 - missed out on some of the stuff that was
95:17 - at the very top
95:20 - so I don't think I missed out on too
95:22 - much but just in case if I do miss your
95:24 - question uh throw it in the comments or
95:27 - message me on Twitter uh you say all

96:11 - lot of these already uh but I'm just
96:14 - looking
96:15 - for uh for something that I I missed or
96:18 - maybe just didn't
96:19 - answer as as I could
96:22 - have also you if if you don't if you

97:02 - some weird some meeting that time and if
97:04 - so then I'll just change the normal time
97:06 - and I'll send out a message on
97:11 - Twitter wow I'm I'm I'm scrolling and
97:14 - I'm still not seeing anything that I
97:16 - didn't address yet so I guess I did a
97:17 - decent job of watching the live chat
97:20 - this time
97:23 - uh let's
97:26 - see I thought I saw something
97:29 - but it wasn't directed to
97:33 - [Music]
97:46 - me okay here's a question I missed uh so
97:51 - sha Shashank Shashank Mishra says Hey
97:55 - Jesse I just started with JavaScript
97:57 - which backend language should I learn it
97:58 - with
98:02 - um I
98:05 - uh this this was asked a while ago so
98:08 - hopefully you're still tuning in um but
98:11 - just for anybody else that might have a
98:12 - similar question um as well if you're
98:16 - learning JavaScript you don't NE you
98:19 - don't actually need to learn backend
98:21 - language with JavaScript because you
98:23 - could use JavaScript on the server side
98:26 - as well so you could use node it depends
98:28 - on what you want to do though so like
98:31 - for instance it let's say you wanted to
98:34 - work with WordPress then learn PHP do
98:37 - you want to work with Microsoft stuff
98:39 - like NET Framework then learn learn
98:42 - c um do you want to
98:46 - develop I mean I do you want to end up
98:48 - developing for uh for mobile you know
98:52 - for Android uh Java or actually what's
98:55 - the new thing now I think it's called
98:56 - cotlin so you might want one of those
98:58 - but then again you could always just use
99:00 - react native and then just learn
99:03 - JavaScript so depending on what you want
99:06 - to do the answer is going to be
99:08 - different but if you don't have anything
99:10 - in particular in mind I personally would
99:13 - just stick with JavaScript learn that
99:14 - really well and learn server side so
99:16 - learn node uh and then you'll be good
99:19 - you can build entire application
99:22 - uh just with
99:24 - JavaScript um but otherwise I mean if
99:28 - you have the time and you want to learn
99:30 - something then then just you know figure
99:32 - out what you want to do and then pick
99:35 - the backend language based on
99:37 - that uh Dimitri says great videos helps
99:40 - a lot thanks Jesse awesome thank you for
99:43 - saying that I appreciate you watching
99:46 - too um Joshua says what do you like to
99:49 - use for accepting credit card payments
99:51 - with react actually I've never done an
99:53 - e-commerce site with react uh I have
99:56 - done a couple that were just like
99:57 - straight up WordPress sites uh I've used
100:02 - um I think I've used stripe obviously
100:06 - PayPal everybody's use PayPal before and
100:08 - I use um authorized.net
100:12 - so those are I think the three that I've
100:14 - worked with of the three the hardest to
100:16 - work was probably authorize.net stripe
100:19 - is super simple to work with PayPal is
100:21 - pretty simple as well so uh it might
100:24 - just come down
100:26 - to uh the rates really uh or if you're
100:29 - doing it because and this of course like
100:32 - I said I haven't done it with react so I
100:34 - don't know if any of those would
100:37 - be harder to work with in react but at
100:40 - least for what I had to do with them in
100:41 - WordPress which to be honest was mostly
100:43 - plug-in based so it's not like I was
100:45 - hardcoding like PHP or anything so uh
100:49 - but I found stripe and PayPal to be the
100:51 - easiest and this was this was a few
100:54 - years ago the last time I had to do an
100:55 - e-commerce site so uh you just keep that
100:59 - in mind when you consider my
101:02 - answer and Ahmed
101:05 - said oh okay Ahmed was having a like a
101:08 - side discussion with someone else so
101:10 - I'll skip that
101:16 - um let
101:19 - see
101:22 - oh James wait back an hour ago James
101:26 - said uh ask what's happening actually I
101:29 - think I did see that I think I I
101:31 - addressed that question so for a second
101:33 - I felt really bad uh because James James
101:36 - says hey I'm a Noob here what's
101:37 - happening so I really really especially
101:40 - like to answer people who are new answer
101:42 - their questions um so that you know they
101:46 - feel welcome right off the bat um
101:51 - XD said we have a nerds meeting here I
101:54 - didn't see that the first time
102:03 - but quiet okay looks like there's a
102:06 - decent conversation going on about react
102:08 - native so uh the video is already really
102:10 - long I'm not going to read everything
102:11 - out but that was awesome uh if if you if
102:15 - you're watching the recording and you
102:16 - haven't got a chance to join in live I
102:18 - definitely like recommend it if if you
102:20 - ever get a chance because there's so
102:22 - many very knowledgeable people in the
102:24 - live chat that provide so much help if
102:27 - you ask a question um they're just
102:29 - really great it's kind of a nice little
102:32 - Community uh that's developed in the
102:34 - live chat and they're they're super
102:36 - helpful and and super nice so uh join in
102:40 - if if you
102:49 - can
102:51 - uh Joshua ask have you had any success
102:53 - with stripe in react okay this is so as
102:56 - as I said earlier I have not done any
102:59 - e-commerce with reacts not
103:19 - yet
103:21 - okay Patrick asks uh what npm module
103:23 - lets you use class instead of class name
103:27 - uh let me let me check really quick
103:31 - because where was that I had brought up
103:34 - contributors I know it was in a was it
103:38 - Dan I think it was Danny that
103:40 - contributed
103:42 - that
103:49 - um let me see
103:51 - I was hoping it would link right to that
103:54 - here can I see it
103:56 - here uh I guess
104:02 - not I guess I'll just check my package
104:06 - Json
104:08 - um I don't remember offand but I'm sure
104:10 - if I see it I'll I'll remember right
104:13 - away so let's check in here oh here we
104:16 - go Babble plug-in react HTML
104:21 - attribute to ATS so I don't if you could
104:23 - see that one that's the one and then I
104:26 - think there was some configuration maybe
104:29 - in this Babel RC yeah so I had to add
104:34 - this in and conf as well I didn't add
104:36 - this in uh Patrick added I'm pretty sure
104:39 - not Patrick uh Danny added this in uh
104:42 - I'm pretty sure that was the the pull
104:44 - request from from Danny so
104:48 - um anyway but it's really help ful so
104:51 - thanks for that that pool
104:54 - request um and that's the uh that's the
104:58 - module and I'm pretty sure it does work
105:01 - um it's not just for class it's for the
105:03 - other the other attributes as well so um
105:08 - I'm going to get spoiled by it and then
105:09 - work on a project where I don't have it
105:11 - and then mess it up but it's really cool
105:14 - for
105:19 - now
105:31 - [Music]
105:37 - okay cool it looks like um pretty much
105:39 - everybody was saying that the resolution
105:41 - was fine so that's good to know uh maybe
105:45 - I finally got the right settings here
105:47 - and I can actually stream from home so
105:50 - uh I'll do I'm going to check out the
105:51 - video later on and and play it back and
105:53 - just kind of see what the quality was uh
105:56 - but if if it's decent then maybe I am I
105:59 - will be able to stream from home so I
106:01 - that's really good because then it
106:04 - doesn't really matter the only thing
106:06 - that was bothering me about not being
106:07 - able to go in to work uh to do my work
106:10 - was just not being able to
106:12 - stream so if I can do it from
106:15 - home then then it can take their time
106:18 - and block GitHub for as long as they
106:20 - want and I I'll enjoy working from
106:26 - [Music]
106:49 - home
106:55 - someone who's uh I I can't read this
106:57 - name because it's it's not in like nor
106:59 - my normal
107:02 - alphabet it says says what the hell in
107:05 - here so I was not sure you know what I
107:09 - bet that this person joined in right
107:11 - when I had my style.css file open so
107:14 - that was the appropriate response
107:19 - so
107:34 - okay looks like I'm seeing like a a few
107:37 - different um comments of just kind of
107:41 - adjusting things uh so I'm going to save
107:43 - I'm going to look over that later uh
107:45 - when I finish up these adjustments but
107:48 - uh I'm going to skip over it for now so
107:50 - I can make sure I get to everybody's
107:57 - [Music]
108:08 - questions man I'm I I was just getting
108:11 - hammered today with all the the comments
108:13 - I'm I'm never showing my style.css file
108:16 - on a stream again this is like Patrick
108:19 - says I've never seen a mini map with a
108:21 - scroll bar before uh
108:25 - so I'm just messing around you guys are
108:27 - you're fine I I can take it and I agree
108:31 - with
108:34 - [Music]
108:38 - you XD says I prefer to be refactoring
108:41 - while coding so yeah uh this was in
108:44 - response I think when I was talking
108:46 - about saying I just kept putting off
108:48 - actually you know organizing everything
108:50 - the way it should be I I really do too
108:53 - like I like to refactor like immediately
108:55 - after I get it working and everything
108:57 - and then refactor
108:59 - but these are these are all all things
109:01 - that are best practices that you get you
109:04 - all are mentioning and uh
109:07 - so uh I did not follow those for this
109:15 - project okay some some people were
109:18 - asking about the um
109:21 - oh let me go back to here this image so
109:23 - it's actually uh this is called a monstr
109:27 - so uh m o n s r a n c a monstr so I I
109:32 - guess it sounded like I was saying
109:33 - monster so yeah so it's actually a
109:36 - monstr so I had a few questions about
109:38 - that in the live chat so uh this is in
109:42 - the middle here is what's called uh the
109:45 - Eucharist so I mean this is like in
109:47 - terms of Catholicism this is like the
109:50 - most important thing
109:53 - um uh about like the entire worship like
109:57 - if you ever been to to a Catholic like
110:00 - worship ceremony it's called a mass and
110:02 - this is like the Highlight so anyway I
110:04 - mean I don't I don't want to go into a
110:06 - big uh discussion here because this is a
110:08 - coding thing but basically just know
110:10 - that these monstrances are supposed to
110:13 - be like very beautiful because it holds
110:16 - something very important so uh that's
110:19 - what this is a pict picture of so in
110:21 - terms of The catechetical Institute
110:23 - Their audience for this are going to be
110:26 - um people who work within the Catholic
110:28 - church so they're going to like
110:30 - immediately when they see this it's
110:31 - going to be a very powerful image for
110:33 - them uh so that's why we wanted to
110:36 - include it right here and it was
110:37 - important but yes but it's not it's not
110:39 - monster it is a
110:41 - monstrance um and to be honest with you
110:44 - the word is probably came from Latin and
110:46 - I know quite a bit of Latin but I right
110:48 - now I I can't tell you what that word
110:51 - originally came from uh
110:54 - but anyway uh let's
111:06 - see okay so we have some comments about
111:08 - the the tagline and things so
111:18 - um
111:20 - okay so we're asking about like
111:22 - potentially could we make this um
111:24 - smaller and then put this tagline under
111:26 - it I'd actually I was kind of thinking
111:28 - about that but
111:33 - um
111:34 - do I I think that we want to keep it
111:38 - bigger but it may if I can't think of
111:40 - anything else that may be something we
111:42 - go to is to just have this as a very
111:45 - small kind of image in the top and have
111:48 - this under well off to try it out but
111:50 - I'm pretty sure
111:53 - that this looks better when it's
111:56 - bigger but we'll see there's definitely
111:58 - room for uh kind of you know messing
112:02 - around with it I guess
112:07 - um Al Allan says bless you so I don't
112:11 - know I don't I guess that was directed
112:13 - to me so thank you um Isaiah says how do
112:17 - you come up with designs for your
112:18 - website
112:21 - [Music]
112:23 - um basically so I start off everything
112:27 - the basis for all the designs are is uh
112:29 - material design so Google's uh design
112:32 - framework is called material design if
112:34 - you haven't checked it out just type in
112:36 - into a Google search the first thing
112:38 - that comes up most likely will be
112:39 - Google's documentation on material
112:42 - design um really nice I I really like it
112:45 - the more I the more I learn about it and
112:47 - get into it the more I appreciate it so
112:49 - um That's the basis for my design I'd
112:51 - like I like it because it's a pretty
112:54 - standard thing it's used for a lot of
112:55 - sites so from a user's perspective the
112:58 - design patterns will be familiar the way
113:00 - the UI Works will be familiar so I like
113:03 - that if a user comes to one of my sites
113:05 - they'll see things that they've most
113:06 - likely seen on other sites or apps uh so
113:10 - it just I don't know I think it just
113:12 - makes things a little bit more
113:13 - comfortable for the user for me it gives
113:15 - me the benefit of not having to make
113:17 - every single decision about the design
113:19 - so I start from
113:21 - there and then I adapt based on what the
113:25 - needs are so you know whatever whatever
113:28 - the client or whoever from that I'm
113:30 - working with uh whatever they need
113:33 - sometimes I do have to adapt things uh
113:36 - to accommodate that or sometimes they
113:38 - have very distinct like preferences for
113:41 - style that I try to blend as best I can
113:44 - with material design principles so not
113:47 - every single thing on the site will
113:49 - follow material design spec exactly
113:52 - because occasionally I I I need to kind
113:55 - of be a little bit flexible to be able
113:57 - to try to blend the style that the
113:59 - client wants with that uh but for the
114:02 - most part I do try to follow material
114:04 - design Styles and then when I'm actually
114:06 - thinking about design stuff sometimes
114:08 - like I just throw it on there and just
114:10 - move it around see how it works I like
114:13 - to draw things out on paper I'm a
114:14 - terrible terrible artist when it comes
114:16 - to drawing but I can at least get like a
114:19 - visual of where things are laid out so I
114:21 - wouldn't consider myself a designer but
114:23 - I do have to do design work uh so that's
114:26 - kind of like my my process for uh for
114:29 - design and it's uh it's I've never
114:32 - undergone any like formal training for
114:33 - design or anything so I'm I'm sure that
114:36 - there are more efficient ways of doing
114:37 - that uh but this is just what I've kind
114:40 - of developed out of necessity of having
114:42 - to do
114:44 - this
114:48 - um oh
114:50 - uh sudu I'm not sure how to pronounce
114:54 - that sorry if I mispronounced your name
114:56 - ask can you please suggest some tutorial
114:57 - for Python and D Jango I don't know
115:00 - about D Jango but uh for python Udacity
115:04 - um intro to CSS course is done all in
115:08 - Python and uh I like that course so that
115:11 - might be something that uh you might
115:14 - want to check into and then supplement
115:16 - that with something that's more Django
115:19 - specific
115:20 - as
115:22 - well Alexandre says hello hey how's it
115:29 - going Matt says the Django website
115:31 - actually has a really good intro
115:33 - tutorial
115:40 - Cool J j503 Cool says it kind of looks
115:45 - like an old school WordPress
115:47 - design honestly I'm not going to lie the
115:50 - header to me especially when I've shrunk
115:52 - it like this does look more old school
115:55 - than so like the the header as it
115:58 - currently is
116:03 - um this does not look like an old school
116:06 - design but this is starting to look more
116:09 - like an old school
116:11 - design I didn't realize it until you
116:13 - said it but as soon as I saw that
116:15 - comment I totally agree and now I feel
116:18 - terrible about it
116:21 - I guess
116:22 - there's yeah now I I like it so much
116:26 - less now that you said
116:28 - that we'll see maybe I'll have to think
116:30 - about it even more but I mean at the end
116:32 - of the day like I
116:35 - um I just need to
116:38 - include these El basically every element
116:41 - that's in here right now has to be in
116:42 - there somewhere so I have to include
116:45 - them all I can do some rearranging of
116:47 - things but as long as they're all in in
116:49 - there it should be okay so I guess we
116:53 - have some room if if anyone has any
116:55 - other suggestions as long as
116:57 - everything's included it might actually
116:59 - work so uh let me
117:02 - know
117:04 - um but yeah I'll have to think about
117:06 - that this ended up being more difficult
117:09 - than I'd
117:10 - anticipated hopefully the end result is
117:12 - worth it though uh I might do an
117:14 - alternate version where the change is
117:16 - less drastic where maybe I I just shrink
117:19 - it everything
117:20 - slightly if I can't get this one to work
117:24 - and then maybe it'll work it'll work
117:26 - better like
117:27 - that but um anyway I uh I think that's
117:31 - it for today and uh yeah we've
117:33 - definitely dropped below our normal
117:35 - amount of viewers at this point so um
117:39 - thank you for
117:40 - watching and I will I won't be back for
117:44 - a while so next Wednesday will probably
117:46 - be the next time I do a stream so um
117:49 - have a great weekend everyone and uh if
117:51 - you're in in the United States uh have a
