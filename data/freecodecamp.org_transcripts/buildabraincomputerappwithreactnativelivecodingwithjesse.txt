00:02 - hey everybody it's jesse i know it's
00:05 - it's been a while it's been uh since new
00:08 - year's since i did a stream on free code
00:10 - camp uh so i'm happy to be back
00:14 - and uh i have a new mic so let me know
00:17 - how it sounds if anybody can hear me i
00:19 - actually got the uh
00:21 - i got a nice upgrade here so this is one
00:23 - of the
00:24 - uh yeti
00:26 - um microphones
00:29 - uh so i saw a lot of a lot of streamers
00:31 - using those had good reviews so i
00:33 - figured
00:34 - you know i've been doing this for a
00:35 - while maybe i better upgrade
00:37 - and i was doing some podcasts lately and
00:40 - the audio quality is obviously very
00:42 - important
00:43 - but today
00:44 - i want to
00:46 - program something that's going to work
00:47 - with
00:49 - with this little headset
00:50 - uh this is the let me see if i can get
00:53 - the logo and plug it to
00:56 - neurocity uh notion headset and
01:00 - so once we get it hooked up maybe i'll
01:02 - try putting it on and see what we can do
01:03 - with it but
01:06 - the uh
01:08 - i did a video on my channel kind of
01:09 - introducing what this thing could do and
01:12 - doing a little demo of it so if you're
01:13 - interested in learning more about that
01:15 - particular headset uh check out my
01:18 - my youtube channel links in the
01:19 - description
01:20 - and uh you can see it was one of like
01:23 - the last few videos i did you'll see
01:25 - that one in there
01:27 - but
01:28 - today i want to actually code
01:30 - a an app a react native app that will
01:34 - run on on mobile
01:36 - that will sync up with this headset and
01:38 - allow you to do some stuff so phase one
01:41 - of this app
01:42 - is gonna be
01:44 - uh
01:45 - just just sync the device up
01:47 - and
01:49 - track
01:50 - your focus and if you start to lose
01:52 - focus we're gonna do something on the
01:54 - phone so
01:56 - i haven't decided for sure yet maybe
01:58 - vibrate the phone or
02:00 - make a little noise
02:02 - something like that
02:03 - that's gonna be like the mvp phase one
02:06 - that i'd like to actually get out
02:08 - on the app store
02:10 - after that
02:12 - i think it'd be cool to maybe add more
02:14 - features uh see if you could
02:18 - make more things happen uh in terms of
02:20 - focus i'd love to be able to have it run
02:23 - on uh like android auto so you could
02:26 - track your focus while you're driving
02:27 - and get an alert if you start to lose
02:29 - focus
02:30 - so
02:32 - uh there's some
02:33 - some cool things you could do
02:35 - beyond just focus you can also train
02:38 - gestures so if like i said check out the
02:40 - video if you want to learn more about it
02:41 - but basically it's possible with this
02:44 - device to
02:47 - think about doing something like moving
02:49 - your arm
02:51 - something whatever whatever you want to
02:52 - think about
02:53 - and then trigger an action
02:56 - so any action you can think of uh for
03:00 - either something on the internet or an
03:02 - internet of things connected device
03:06 - so
03:06 - i'm hoping to do a lot of cool stuff
03:08 - with this
03:10 - but first step is we just need to get it
03:12 - hooked up and working with an app
03:15 - and
03:16 - so that's what we're going to start with
03:18 - so basically all i've done
03:20 - uh if you haven't seen my my live stream
03:22 - before the idea is i it's
03:25 - there's no prep work beforehand
03:28 - i don't rehearse
03:30 - or even do that much research beforehand
03:32 - because i wanted to be
03:34 - uh as authentic as possible in terms of
03:37 - uh what a developer would go through
03:39 - when they're approaching new problems uh
03:42 - and trying to solve things on the fly so
03:45 - uh i'm gonna set a little timer
03:48 - we're gonna code
03:50 - during the timer when the timer goes off
03:52 - i'm gonna check the live chat so there's
03:54 - a lot of activity in the live chat
03:57 - and i just wanna say hey to everybody in
03:59 - the chat now
04:01 - and let you know i'm not ignoring your
04:03 - questions i'm going to get to all your
04:04 - questions and comments but i'm just
04:06 - going to code a little bit first
04:08 - okay so
04:09 - i actually
04:10 - didn't get my timer up beforehand so let
04:13 - me let me do that now
04:16 - i'm going to do that on another screen
04:19 - hey let me show you my screen while i'm
04:21 - doing this
04:23 - there we go now you don't have to look
04:25 - at me as much
04:33 - my timer
04:36 - i've lost my timer app
04:44 - oh well
04:45 - um
04:47 - i just need a pomodoro timer
04:57 - i was using a pomodoro timer that
04:59 - somebody who used to watch the live
05:01 - streams made
05:02 - and i had it up on my screen but i close
05:04 - it
05:07 - and let's do
05:09 - let me just get give you the basics of
05:11 - what i've done here in the code first
05:14 - all i did was scaffold a project using
05:16 - expo
05:17 - uh so
05:19 - expo is a um a way to use react native
05:25 - uh
05:26 - that if you're not familiar with react
05:27 - native react native is using javascript
05:29 - to build android and ios and web apps
05:32 - right expo helps you to do that it makes
05:35 - react native easier to work with so i
05:37 - just
05:38 - used exo expo i'm on this is pretty much
05:41 - the latest version there might be some
05:42 - minor versions after this but uh we're
05:46 - pretty up to date if you hear noise in
05:48 - the background that's my kids i have
05:49 - four kids and they're all running around
05:51 - so uh you may
05:53 - hear that
05:58 - [Music]
06:02 - hey i'm i'm doing a live stream right
06:04 - now
06:07 - [Music]
06:18 - ambrose i'm sorry if nobody wants to go
06:20 - outside with you buddy can i eat your
06:22 - cookie
06:25 - go ahead upstairs you already had ice
06:27 - cream but i want to have your cookie
06:29 - dough
06:29 - no eat your ice cream and be good
06:34 - want cookie dough bites
06:35 - gemma
06:36 - you already had cooked up boys please
06:38 - take your sister upstairs
06:46 - here you want to stay with me yeah all
06:48 - right look why don't you sit over there
06:49 - and you can watch the live stream okay
06:51 - you want to do that all right buddy
06:55 - all right sorry about that my
06:59 - my five-year-old's very upset
07:02 - gemma please go upstairs
07:04 - my father was very upset because no none
07:06 - of his siblings wanted to go outside
07:08 - with him so
07:10 - um
07:15 - so uh
07:17 - it's ambrose
07:18 - all right so
07:21 - the um
07:23 - where was i totally on track oh react
07:25 - native so we're using react native
07:27 - uh with expo
07:29 - and
07:30 - we were just going through the package
07:32 - json
07:33 - basically my my point of going through
07:35 - this was i'm pretty sure we're like
07:37 - pretty up to date on most of the
07:38 - packages so
07:40 - um we should be
07:42 - pretty good with that we are using
07:43 - typescript as well so typescript um
07:46 - is
07:48 - something you can use with javascript to
07:50 - help have uh be like a more strongly
07:53 - typed uh version of javascript
07:56 - uh
07:58 - there's a ton of info about typescript
07:59 - out there so i'm not going to take a ton
08:01 - of time to explain it but basically like
08:04 - the javascript you see might have a few
08:07 - things that are different than normal in
08:08 - there that's probably typescript
08:09 - otherwise it works just like normal
08:11 - javascript
08:12 - all right so let me slide this over
08:16 - and just show you what i have so far i
08:18 - just took the boilerplate that expo
08:20 - gives you that lets you run an app and i
08:22 - added in
08:23 - some of this authentication stuff now
08:27 - let me copy and paste in the starter
08:30 - um
08:32 - github repo into the chat
08:34 - so you all can check out the github repo
08:37 - that i'm going to be pulling some code
08:39 - from and i haven't put
08:42 - my code on github yet but i will and
08:45 - i'll include that link in the in the
08:47 - description
08:49 - so
08:50 - the
08:51 - the creators of the nerosity notion
08:55 - brain computer
08:57 - have already made a react
09:00 - kind of getting started repo so it's for
09:02 - react not for react native but i think
09:05 - we can use it and make it work
09:07 - to authenticate and be able to sync up
09:10 - our device with um
09:13 - with an app
09:16 - so that's where i pulled some of this
09:17 - code from
09:20 - the the only thing that i think won't
09:23 - work is so they're using this uh local
09:25 - storage stuff we don't have local
09:27 - storage on
09:29 - um an app right there's different
09:32 - storage so we're gonna probably not be
09:34 - able to use that uh otherwise i think we
09:37 - should be able to reuse a lot of this
09:38 - code
09:39 - okay so
09:42 - i got basically to the point where i
09:44 - needed to put in some text inputs
09:47 - and that's where i i kind of stop so
09:50 - we need the user to
09:52 - input a little bit of data
09:55 - from their device so everybody's going
09:57 - to have a different device id and that
09:59 - they're going to need to use
10:02 - everybody who uses the app so we need to
10:04 - provide them with some some inputs right
10:07 - and let's let's actually run
10:09 - a version of this app
10:11 - uh let's see if we can do
10:16 - so expo lets you run it i wonder if it's
10:19 - going to let me run as a web app
10:28 - i don't want to run it on my phone
10:29 - because i want you all to be able to see
10:31 - it so let's see if i can
10:33 - uh
10:35 - run this
10:39 - if i could do like w yep there we go
10:42 - so it didn't list it as an option but if
10:44 - you hit w you can open it as a a web app
10:48 - so let's see if it'll if it'll run i may
10:50 - have messed it up when i copied and
10:52 - pasted this stuff yeah and i did so
10:54 - let me pull this over and just show you
10:56 - so we're getting an error because of
10:58 - that local storage stuff
11:01 - so let's take that out
11:07 - uh we can keep this in so these are our
11:10 - react hooks
11:12 - right so um we can keep this in and just
11:15 - say use state
11:18 - and instead of device id let's go
11:25 - let's just give it an empty string for
11:27 - now
11:29 - and we have this what is this navigate
11:31 - thing here um
11:37 - let's
11:38 - comment this out for now
11:42 - and the innovation device id
11:45 - we don't have a device id so okay this
11:48 - is covered
11:51 - and we need to
11:56 - rid of this
11:58 - subscription
12:00 - set user we're set user
12:04 - okay
12:11 - all right let's see if we can at least
12:12 - get it to run
12:23 - all right cool so we got it to run so
12:25 - you can see let me make this bigger
12:28 - so that's the the text that we have
12:31 - so we actually have this app running now
12:33 - we're running it
12:34 - in kind of web mode
12:36 - so it's not exactly
12:39 - the same as running it on a mobile
12:40 - device but it's going to give us a good
12:42 - idea without having to go through
12:44 - everything about like running a mobile
12:45 - simulator it's going to give us a pretty
12:47 - good idea what our our app is doing
12:49 - at least to be able to say like does it
12:51 - even
12:52 - even work am i getting like crazy errors
12:54 - so that's a good start
12:58 - um but we need the user to be able to
13:00 - put in some data right so
13:03 - we need
13:05 - the
13:07 - device id
13:09 - that's probably the most important thing
13:14 - and set users to delay cities
13:17 - yeah so we definitely need a text input
13:19 - for device i id so you can see i've
13:22 - already pulled in text input from react
13:23 - native
13:25 - react native comes with um a bunch of
13:27 - components like by default
13:30 - so we're going to put in
13:34 - a text input down here so instead of
13:38 - this text that we just saw
13:40 - let's throw in a text input
13:42 - and we could change this text to say um
13:51 - make your notion the headset is called
13:53 - the notion headset and let's put in text
13:57 - input
14:00 - and
14:04 - i don't think we need like that
14:06 - let's look up
14:09 - what all the props are that go into a
14:11 - text input right so let's go back to
14:14 - our our chrome here
14:17 - and let's look look uh
14:19 - react native
14:21 - text
14:22 - input
14:25 - and uh in about about 15 minutes i'm
14:27 - gonna go back to the chat and read a
14:29 - bunch of stuff so if you're if you're in
14:31 - the chat commenting
14:33 - i will definitely get to those comments
14:36 - and
14:37 - i i don't intend to ignore the comments
14:41 - there we go this is the react native
14:43 - documentation and this will give us just
14:45 - a little example
14:47 - um
14:49 - yeah actually let's just copy and paste
14:51 - this example and that'll give us a good
14:53 - place to start
15:04 - hey ambrose can you uh don't dribble
15:08 - basketball while i'm doing this because
15:09 - i make a lot of noise okay buddy
15:11 - thank you
15:13 - all right so
15:17 - i'm not gonna mess with the style yet
15:18 - i'm not that worried about the style uh
15:20 - this at first we're just gonna try to
15:22 - get this
15:23 - working and then we can make it look
15:25 - nicer to be honest i'm going for kind of
15:27 - a really minimal interface anyway
15:31 - uh but we have unchanged text
15:35 - but in this case
15:37 - what i want to do here is uh add the
15:39 - device id so if we look at our hooks up
15:42 - here
15:44 - we have set device id as our hook so
15:47 - we're going to
15:49 - change this to
15:51 - set
15:52 - device id
15:55 - okay
15:55 - and now every time a user types in here
15:59 - it's going to give us
16:01 - it's going to change the state for this
16:03 - component the device id state
16:06 - and for the value we're going to put in
16:11 - device id
16:13 - okay so what this will do for us is this
16:15 - makes this input now what we call a
16:17 - controlled input or controlled component
16:20 - because the value is now controlled by
16:23 - our component state
16:25 - so
16:27 - the value
16:28 - is the state and when you change the
16:31 - value of the input it updates state
16:35 - let's save it and see if it see if it
16:36 - worked
16:41 - let's go back here yep and look we have
16:44 - we have that and if we check so let's
16:47 - let's inspect this
16:49 - and see if we can uh see the state
16:52 - updating
16:56 - i'll make this a lot bigger
16:59 - we should be able to see the state
17:00 - updating
17:06 - for our
17:08 - see if we could find our root component
17:16 - let's get rid of that
17:25 - maybe it's app yeah all right so here we
17:27 - go here's our state
17:29 - and we can see
17:31 - as
17:32 - the type
17:34 - the state changes
17:36 - so
17:40 - it's working at least that's that's
17:42 - working right
17:44 - now
17:46 - our uh
17:47 - let's go back to our code
17:52 - let's see what we need to send so
17:55 - we need a user
18:01 - all right so if we make a to create a
18:04 - new notion all we need is the device id
18:07 - so we may be able to test that out
18:10 - right away
18:12 - let's talk about our user set user
18:15 - so we're getting the user from subscribe
18:18 - here so we don't need to to input the
18:20 - user
18:24 - so we may be able to try it out
18:27 - to see if we can sync this device
18:32 - yeah let's give that a shot
18:35 - all right cool
18:36 - so
18:38 - we're gonna need to change the code just
18:40 - a bit though
18:47 - so if there's a user we set user
18:51 - i want some type of indication though
18:53 - that this is actually working so let's
18:55 - add in a little bit of text here and say
18:59 - if
19:00 - user
19:02 - then
19:04 - let's render
19:07 - a little text
19:10 - it says
19:17 - logged in
19:19 - okay that way we'll know it worked
19:22 - so what this is doing is it's checking
19:24 - that state
19:26 - for user which should be empty let's
19:28 - double check that
19:29 - so user is now is set to null at first
19:33 - but
19:34 - if we successfully
19:37 - log login
19:38 - with our device
19:41 - then we should be able to subscribe
19:46 - and get a user and then that will set
19:48 - the user
19:50 - then down here will detect that there is
19:53 - a user and we'll say okay now let's
19:56 - display the text logged in
19:58 - okay
19:59 - so if you're not familiar with react or
20:01 - react native this might be a little bit
20:03 - confusing to you feel free to ask some
20:05 - questions i'll try to
20:09 - explain as much as i can in about 10
20:11 - minutes i'm gonna take a break and and
20:12 - look at the questions here
20:16 - but let's give this a shot now
20:19 - if i miss something i'm sure it'll throw
20:21 - an error and we can uh we can fix that
20:24 - uh but for now
20:25 - i think we have let me give it a save
20:27 - here
20:28 - just verify that
20:31 - that's working okay great oh i know what
20:33 - we need we need a button
20:35 - we need some sort of button to submit
20:37 - this right
20:38 - okay so let's add in a
20:40 - button
20:41 - and uh react native actually has a
20:44 - button
20:48 - well
20:49 - let me uh import it here so let's import
20:53 - button
20:55 - oops dude
21:00 - and
21:04 - so you have this button and uh i guess
21:07 - we could check let's check the
21:08 - documentation for this
21:10 - so we'll search for
21:12 - we're already in here buttons right
21:14 - there
21:15 - let's copy and paste the example for
21:17 - button
21:29 - there we go
21:31 - so it's going to say press me and then
21:33 - it's going to run this alert but we
21:34 - don't want the alert what we want is on
21:38 - press we want it to run this
21:42 - uh
21:43 - this
21:44 - use effect so
21:46 - um what we'll do is
21:50 - let's just grab this code
21:55 - yeah
21:57 - so i'm going to grab this code i'm going
21:59 - to comment this out because we're going
22:00 - to want it to behave like this at some
22:02 - point but for now we just want it to say
22:08 - let's see
22:11 - we'll just call it login oops we'll say
22:18 - login and
22:20 - we'll make this
22:21 - an arrow function
22:26 - and let's
22:31 - paste in this code
22:34 - oops
22:36 - it's not working
22:49 - let's get rid of that we'll get rid of
22:50 - that part
22:55 - okay
23:05 - notion oh
23:17 - let's do this let's do closed
23:23 - notion equals null
23:26 - and then
23:28 - that way we can set notion here how
23:30 - about that
23:32 - whoops
23:33 - let
23:34 - notion
23:36 - maybe
23:41 - are we declaring it
23:43 - oh okay
23:51 - oh what happened there okay so we
23:53 - already have notion as a state
23:55 - let's back up a little bit
24:01 - why is it giving me this
24:06 - because i got too many brackets that's
24:08 - what
24:09 - there we go
24:15 - okay so now we have a login function
24:17 - that should get us what we need here
24:22 - and we just need to call it on press
24:29 - there we go
24:30 - there we go all right
24:33 - so we're gonna
24:35 - we saved it let's try it out
24:38 - oh
24:39 - loading
24:43 - i messed something
24:44 - up
24:46 - all right where are we at
24:49 - why is it saying loading if loading
24:53 - that's why it's saying though all right
24:55 - let's
25:05 - let's just set loading to false
25:07 - for
25:12 - now there we go
25:15 - okay
25:18 - i need to get my device id
25:21 - so on another screen
25:23 - i'm going to grab my device id
25:28 - see if i can
25:33 - find it i thought i had it up already
25:35 - but
25:36 - there we go
25:44 - and actually let me move this over real
25:46 - quick i'm not really sure if i'm
25:48 - supposed to show my device id or not
26:00 - but i know how to fix that let's do this
26:12 - i'm gonna set the width
26:17 - to five
26:18 - so check this out look
26:20 - so the width of my text input is five so
26:22 - when i paste my device id in oh
26:24 - everybody saw it anyway oh well
26:28 - i'm not that worried about it
26:31 - i just want to see what error we're
26:32 - getting
26:34 - because we sh if this is not working we
26:35 - should get an error
26:38 - i'm getting nothing
26:41 - am i getting
26:42 - anything in the network
26:44 - what's going on
26:50 - nothing all right
26:53 - let's throw in some
26:56 - console logs
27:01 - so
27:03 - first thing i want to see is
27:05 - is our login function
27:07 - even being called at all
27:09 - so let's say
27:14 - console.log
27:16 - i'm just going to put in
27:19 - a little string there just to see
27:21 - what's happening
27:24 - all right hey there we go we got
27:26 - something this time
27:30 - oh nice
27:34 - so it did run and we got an error so we
27:37 - got illegal app name from firebase
27:42 - check our network here
27:47 - interesting
27:50 - yeah so it looks like
27:56 - it's trying to do something
28:03 - so that's a good that's good progress
28:05 - right
28:06 - all right
28:07 - good progress
28:10 - i'm also going to check my timer because
28:12 - it's got to be
28:13 - just about time for
28:17 - taking questions here yep about a minute
28:20 - i'll stop and answer some questions
28:25 - and
28:26 - at this point
28:28 - it looks like new notion device id set
28:31 - notion
28:47 - oh i know let's check our state let's
28:49 - see if we got anything back uh because i
28:52 - wonder if
28:53 - if we're getting an error on this part
28:55 - or if we're getting an error on this
28:57 - part
28:58 - so let's see if the state updated at all
29:01 - go to our components here and
29:04 - one of these
29:06 - hooks is the state that we're looking
29:08 - for
29:09 - so let's
29:10 - paste that in
29:14 - cool look at that all right awesome
29:16 - so we got our um
29:20 - we got our stuff here
29:26 - we got a response or at least we got
29:30 - something right
29:32 - uh so
29:37 - i believe then our error
29:40 - would be in the uh
29:42 - in that second part that we saw right so
29:46 - this is happening
29:48 - we're setting
29:50 - all the data we get back after we do
29:51 - this are being set here
29:54 - then
29:55 - this is running
29:58 - and we're trying to subscribe and get a
29:59 - user
30:00 - right but something's happening there
30:03 - so
30:05 - let's take a little break i'm answering
30:06 - some questions and then we're gonna come
30:08 - back and see if we can figure out what
30:10 - else we need to do here
30:11 - at this point it might not be a bad idea
30:13 - to go look at the
30:15 - uh the demo react code provided by
30:18 - neurocity
30:20 - the the people who make the headset
30:22 - and see what they did
30:25 - because i know i didn't copy and paste
30:26 - everything over
30:28 - uh and i bet that there's some other
30:30 - stuff happening that
30:32 - we need to do to make that work
30:36 - all right so
30:38 - i need to
30:40 - let me make the text on the chat a
30:41 - little bigger so i can see
30:46 - there we go
30:50 - okay all right for everybody who just
30:52 - joined uh as well uh i'm gonna use this
30:55 - brain computer interface i did a demo
30:57 - video kind of an intro to this brain
30:59 - computer interface device on my channel
31:01 - so
31:02 - check the link in the description to go
31:03 - to my channel uh and then you will be
31:06 - able to find that that video on the
31:07 - brain computer interface and get kind of
31:10 - an overview of what this thing is and
31:12 - what it can do
31:14 - and let's see
31:20 - i'm kind of just scrolling through the
31:21 - uh
31:22 - chat right now looking for questions
31:25 - a couple questions about what language
31:26 - you're using this is react native and
31:28 - the language is javascript uh with
31:31 - typescript
31:34 - um
31:35 - i have a question about for cyber
31:36 - security what is best um
31:40 - b
31:41 - tech in cs uh
31:44 - or it tell you the truth i don't i don't
31:47 - really know
31:48 - if anybody out there is in uh cyber
31:50 - security uh and can answer that question
31:53 - uh we're kind of wondering what type of
31:55 - degree is best
31:57 - for cyber
31:58 - security let's see hi i'm from the
32:01 - philippines it's a great feeling to see
32:02 - you code here thanks for sharing oh
32:04 - you're welcome thanks for saying that
32:06 - that's awesome
32:10 - uh michael wahl says ceh for ethical
32:14 - hacking is an option okay
32:17 - that's cool what is that certified
32:19 - ethical hacker i believe
32:21 - is the ceh
32:24 - lonnie said it was too close up so i had
32:26 - a video on my face at the beginning it's
32:28 - too close up i will remember that maybe
32:30 - i will back up a bit uh next time
32:34 - uh code dragon says learning a lot from
32:35 - your channel that's awesome that's
32:37 - awesome there's a lot of good content
32:39 - here on the free code camp channel
32:42 - a lot of a lot of really smart people
32:44 - contributing
32:46 - so i mean my live streams
32:48 - it is what it is right uh but there's
32:50 - some really even if you don't care for
32:52 - what i'm doing right now check out the
32:54 - other videos they're uh they're really
32:56 - good
32:59 - uh rod says it would be great to see
33:00 - more live coding videos on the free code
33:02 - camp channel i'm really going to try to
33:04 - do some more live coding i used to do it
33:06 - a lot more and i gotten away from it and
33:08 - uh had a lot of
33:11 - stuff happening
33:13 - uh with my job so i'm i'm not able to
33:15 - work from home as much as i used to be
33:17 - able to i had some health issues going
33:20 - on
33:20 - uh but i think
33:22 - i got that all worked out now and uh
33:25 - hopefully and so i'm gonna try to get on
33:27 - a better schedule so i can um
33:30 - uh live stream more
33:32 - jeff says thanks for coding live so we
33:34 - can all watch this is awesome you're
33:35 - welcome thanks for watching uh collins
33:38 - asks what do we use react for exactly
33:41 - okay so react is a library that helps
33:43 - you build web apps uh i think it's some
33:45 - of its strengths at least from my point
33:47 - of view are uh making state management
33:50 - uh easy it's once you kind of learn it
33:54 - it's it's it's pretty simple to kind of
33:58 - think through the flow of state
34:01 - so i like it for that
34:03 - and
34:04 - there's a lot more to react but
34:06 - basically it just helps you build web
34:08 - apps react native uses kind of the same
34:10 - concept the same logic but then let you
34:14 - apply that to mobile apps
34:22 - let's see
34:24 - uh not found says what will uh the back
34:26 - end be built in uh so
34:29 - neurosci the company that makes the uh
34:31 - the brain computer interface has their
34:34 - own kind of back end for handling like
34:36 - the the data that's coming from the
34:38 - headset so we're going to take advantage
34:40 - of what they're providing
34:41 - and then
34:44 - we won't at least in the stage one we
34:46 - won't need our own back end
34:49 - as we add later functionality that's
34:51 - something we might need to talk about
34:52 - and think about
34:54 - but i'm not 100 decided on
34:57 - what what exactly we would need and what
34:59 - we would use for that
35:05 - i see i'm getting to the point in the
35:06 - chat where all my kids came in and uh so
35:08 - thanks everybody you're saying the kids
35:10 - are cute
35:11 - yeah that's the real uh for a while i
35:13 - gotta tell you uh i wanted to stream
35:14 - more but i was a little bit embarrassed
35:16 - by my setup
35:17 - and i know it's silly because if you've
35:19 - watched me before you know i've done a
35:20 - ton of streams so my setups always been
35:22 - not that great
35:24 - but like i'm just i'm in a basement
35:26 - and
35:27 - the uh the quality in terms of like
35:29 - audio is probably not great because my
35:31 - kids and everything going on um
35:34 - but then it fi it hit me and it took me
35:37 - way too long to realize this
35:40 - but you know that's
35:42 - if i want my stream to be authentic in
35:44 - how it really is for me to code then i
35:46 - should just leave all that stuff in
35:48 - so i decided just to go for it and
35:51 - you know and stream
35:53 - uh with all the distractions and
35:55 - everything built in
35:56 - uh so
35:58 - hopefully uh everybody kind of
36:00 - understands that and
36:02 - you know this is not like a professional
36:04 - thing
36:05 - that i'm doing it's just a little side
36:06 - thing so
36:08 - um
36:09 - there will be distractions and noise
36:14 - uh carlos says this is the most
36:16 - authentic live stream i've ever seen
36:17 - subscribing now that's awesome
36:28 - all right
36:32 - uh
36:33 - our
36:34 - rv uh says where can we get that brain
36:37 - device uh so if you look up neurosci let
36:41 - me let me give you the link actually let
36:43 - me give you the link to their website
36:45 - and you are
36:47 - double checking i have the right link
36:48 - and then i'll paste it in
36:49 - let me paste that link in for you all
36:51 - this is the website for the neurocity
36:54 - headset i believe you can join
36:57 - i think there's like a wait list right
36:58 - now
37:01 - but you can join that and see about
37:02 - getting it
37:04 - getting the headset
37:12 - okay
37:16 - all right so i'm going to
37:19 - go back to
37:21 - the code now and do a little bit more
37:22 - code
37:24 - and uh
37:28 - let's see looks like someone in the chat
37:31 - using some uh
37:33 - some language
37:39 - so
37:42 - i'm gonna
37:43 - hide that users messages so uh
37:50 - see
37:54 - so anyway hopefully you all didn't see
37:55 - that i think i i think most of the
37:57 - messages were hidden by the filter but
37:59 - somebody was
38:00 - not being nice
38:02 - so uh
38:06 - i um
38:08 - let's see
38:11 - cool let's see
38:16 - i'm a double checking that i got
38:17 - everything
38:26 - all right cool
38:28 - um
38:30 - anyway sorry it took me a couple minutes
38:32 - to catch that i try to keep everything
38:34 - real uh
38:38 - uh positive
38:43 - let's see it might be somebody else
38:50 - all right i think i got all the the
38:52 - people causing trouble so anyway on my
38:56 - channel and on the free code camp
38:57 - channel i try to keep everything
38:59 - positive so
39:00 - uh if if you got
39:03 - if you want to be negative there's so
39:04 - many places on the internet you can just
39:05 - go and talk trash if you want to
39:08 - uh this is not the place for that so try
39:10 - to keep everything encouraging i'm i
39:12 - don't mind if you want to criticize what
39:15 - i'm doing
39:16 - uh in terms of my coding abilities or my
39:19 - ability to live stream that's fine i
39:21 - don't mind that but i don't want you
39:22 - calling anybody else names
39:24 - in the chat
39:25 - uh so
39:27 - if you do i'm
39:29 - i'm not gonna make a big deal uh
39:31 - i'm just gonna hide all your messages
39:34 - so um
39:36 - anyway
39:37 - uh
39:42 - hopefully that's that's through
39:44 - and we can get back to some code so yeah
39:46 - let me get back to some code here
39:48 - i probably
39:50 - let's see
39:52 - probably maybe go for like another half
39:53 - an hour or so and then i'm gonna i'll
39:55 - stop streaming so you know i don't want
39:57 - to
39:58 - it is the weekend i want to spend time
40:00 - with my family so i figured i'd just
40:01 - take about an hour to do some some code
40:03 - and then um
40:04 - you know we you know we won't finish
40:06 - today on this app but you know i'll uh
40:08 - i'll give it another shot
40:10 - uh later in the week and see if we can
40:13 - get it get it finished so
40:15 - what i'm gonna do now is we're gonna go
40:17 - to this uh
40:19 - this repo
40:21 - let me make it bigger
40:23 - so this is just on github uh so i
40:25 - already put a link to this in the in the
40:27 - chat if you weren't here i'm gonna link
40:29 - it again
40:32 - and
40:33 - there we go
40:43 - uh so if you want to check it yourself
40:45 - that links now in the uh in the live
40:47 - chat
40:48 - but i want to go in here and see this is
40:50 - like the react they call their react
40:53 - starter right so
40:55 - uh we do need to change some things
40:57 - though because this is react native so
40:59 - i'm gonna go in here to the source
41:01 - and let's check out there app.js and see
41:03 - if we're missing something important
41:06 - i assume that we're missing something
41:08 - important and that's why it's not
41:10 - working
41:11 - so i'm gonna make this a little bigger i
41:13 - just wanna make sure everybody can see
41:16 - a little bit bigger
41:18 - that's might be a bit too big but better
41:20 - to be too big than too small uh in terms
41:22 - of visibility
41:24 - uh so somebody may be watching this on
41:26 - their phone so
41:28 - uh
41:30 - now i know like so
41:32 - we have these right so we have this
41:34 - we're good uh we did comment this out uh
41:38 - i see so they're doing some navigation
41:40 - so
41:41 - they're navigating to
41:45 - uh
41:47 - some other components so that might be
41:49 - part of the piece that we're missing but
41:51 - let's see let's keep reading
41:55 - let's describe the user
41:58 - so we're trying to try to set the user
42:02 - okay
42:12 - okay so they're using react
42:15 - and they have this login which is
42:18 - basically what
42:19 - what we're doing is the login screen for
42:21 - the most part
42:23 - and they're passing the login screen
42:27 - this info
42:33 - okay
42:34 - so let's check out and see uh what kind
42:37 - of logic they have going on in their
42:38 - login screen
42:40 - to see if we're missing something
42:45 - so let's go back to our source
42:47 - we'll go into
42:49 - i guess pages
42:51 - login
42:58 - oh i see so they're they're saying
43:00 - they're getting the email password
43:17 - so it looks like we need a little bit
43:18 - more
43:20 - is uh we need to email the password so
43:22 - they need they're they're prompting
43:24 - people for the email and password
43:27 - so we're definitely gonna need to do
43:28 - that
43:31 - so here here's what i think is probably
43:34 - happening with their app and should
43:35 - happen
43:38 - is that
43:40 - the uh
43:43 - after they do the part that we did
43:45 - then the user is prompted for more info
43:49 - uh so
43:51 - that's the next part that we have to
43:53 - that we have to do
43:59 - so i guess
44:10 - let me make this a little smaller so i
44:11 - can get kind of a big picture
44:14 - of what's happening
44:16 - might be able to just copy and paste
44:17 - some of this stuff
44:33 - trying to find what we actually need
44:34 - here
44:49 - so we need
44:51 - so this is notion dot login
44:55 - okay
45:17 - all right i think we need to add an
45:19 - email and uh password field
45:22 - and we need to add in state for email
45:24 - and password as well
45:26 - so i'm just gonna grab
45:29 - this
45:31 - first
45:33 - and
45:34 - i'm gonna try to do it all in one
45:36 - in one page for now in one file
45:43 - just for like simplicity
45:45 - down the road we may end up like
45:48 - breaking it out into different files
45:52 - different components
45:54 - and let's grab
45:57 - this
45:59 - use effect
46:14 - and we'll put it down here
46:20 - and we're gonna have to get rid of some
46:21 - of it but
46:24 - that should work for now
46:25 - um let me see if i need something else
46:33 - all right i think we're good
46:35 - at least for now get us to the next step
46:38 - at least
46:39 - so
46:41 - we don't need that
46:46 - i don't need that
46:47 - and i don't need that
46:51 - and
46:53 - i'm not going to do this
46:55 - because i'm just gonna console log the
46:56 - air
47:01 - okay
47:10 - all right so this use effect will only
47:12 - run if some of this data changes
47:17 - right so
47:20 - here's your notion
47:31 - we may not we may actually not want it
47:33 - like this uh async function
47:38 - we may want to change
47:40 - let's change the name of our function
47:51 - let's just change it to init for like
47:53 - initialize
47:55 - so this button is now going to be
47:59 - initialize
48:01 - okay
48:02 - and
48:05 - we'll do it like this let's do
48:14 - let's let's um
48:16 - make
48:17 - more text boxes here
48:19 - that
48:22 - i don't know how we should do this
48:26 - yeah you know let's just make some more
48:28 - text inputs to get all the data we need
48:35 - so we're going to add two more text
48:37 - inputs
48:40 - and
48:42 - instead of device id it's going to be
48:46 - set
48:49 - email
48:55 - email
48:57 - and then we're gonna say
49:00 - set password
49:03 - and the value will be password
49:06 - so this is going to give us three text
49:08 - inputs
49:09 - now and they're going to be
49:11 - linked up
49:13 - with
49:14 - our new state so the first text input is
49:17 - going to be device id
49:18 - next one will be email and the next one
49:20 - will be password
49:21 - all right so we're going to have these
49:23 - in there now
49:24 - and let's save it just make sure
49:27 - we haven't broken anything yet nope we
49:29 - got all three of these and i got them
49:31 - real skinny like this just so that it's
49:33 - not too obvious
49:35 - what my
49:36 - password and stuff is
49:38 - uh
49:41 - this over
49:43 - okay now on press me we're not
49:47 - actually doing anything but let's let's
49:49 - change that
49:50 - we're going to change the logic a little
49:52 - bit here
49:53 - so currently
49:55 - on init
49:57 - we're getting this
49:58 - new notion right
50:00 - and we're setting notion
50:02 - and then this use effect
50:04 - works and we're trying to set the user
50:07 - so we're subscribing
50:09 - and we're trying to set the user here
50:12 - [Music]
50:14 - when we get the user
50:21 - actually what we could do there is email
50:23 - password
50:25 - wage
50:39 - oh do they have their their own
50:42 - their own version of it user
51:00 - i'm actually gonna
51:01 - i'm gonna comment this out for now
51:06 - because
51:13 - i think the login let's go back and look
51:16 - at our
51:22 - app.js again and see what we had
51:25 - uh so
51:34 - if user else navigate
51:38 - i see
51:39 - so we took some of this stuff out i
51:42 - believe this is what i believe is
51:43 - happening
51:44 - um
51:47 - so
51:47 - if you can't get a user
51:51 - it navigates you to the login page and
51:53 - then you have to log in so login needs
51:55 - to happen first
51:58 - [Music]
52:01 - so in so the set user is being passed
52:04 - down as a prop so we're we're good we're
52:06 - actually good in the way we're doing
52:08 - this in that
52:10 - we um
52:12 - the next step
52:14 - is this step here
52:18 - and so
52:20 - i just want to make sure this runs only
52:22 - when we we want it to run
52:26 - so uh
52:28 - these effects
52:33 - i guess
52:38 - i guess it works as long as we enter
52:40 - everything in properly i think this
52:42 - should work
52:47 - okay i think it should work at least to
52:50 - get us to the next step
52:53 - now what i want to do is figure out
52:57 - what my password is that i'm supposed to
52:59 - put in here
53:02 - so let me go back to i'm doing this off
53:05 - screen just to
53:06 - hide i guess what it what this is so
53:12 - oh i know i know now
53:15 - so the way this works is
53:19 - i put in my device id and my email
53:23 - and i should get an email with my
53:26 - password in it
53:32 - i think that's how it'll work
53:40 - let's double check
53:51 - you know we could do
53:53 - we could just clone this
53:58 - have i already forked this maybe i did
54:05 - let's fork this clone it run it
54:08 - then we'll know what the flow is
54:10 - supposed to be from a user perspective
54:14 - i'm going to clone it
54:16 - and we'll just go right in here and
54:18 - clone it from here
54:27 - i'm doing a git clone
54:32 - now i should have this available
54:34 - so let's look at my projects folder and
54:37 - see
54:41 - what is it
54:42 - notion react starter
54:45 - so let's cd into notion react starter
54:49 - i'm going to open up a new vs code
54:52 - window
54:54 - and then i'm gonna
54:57 - go back to the right folder here so i
54:59 - don't
54:59 - accidentally mess things up confuse them
55:02 - stay focused
55:07 - all right now let's go to our other vs
55:09 - code window and just run this really
55:11 - quick
55:13 - we'll do a new terminal
55:15 - let's run
55:17 - uh
55:18 - npe npmi
55:22 - so that'll install everything
55:39 - oh that's not i wonder why that package
55:41 - json was so long i accidentally clicked
55:43 - the package left json
55:46 - good so this is
55:49 - once this installs we'll just run it
55:51 - there we go
55:53 - uh
55:53 - npm
55:55 - run start
56:10 - cool
56:11 - oh i see
56:13 - all right so they have
56:15 - see we were we weren't really that far
56:16 - off this is kind of what our screen has
56:18 - on it it doesn't look like it but it it
56:20 - has this so device id email and password
56:23 - all in one go
56:26 - interesting
56:29 - but how am i supposed to get the
56:30 - password
56:35 - let's go back here and
56:43 - let's see our docs
56:50 - make it a little bigger
56:53 - all right
56:57 - web uh yeah let's see the web app
57:07 - all right device id
57:14 - email and password
57:38 - hmm
57:40 - maybe it wants the password that i use
57:47 - yeah i'll give it a shot
57:48 - i'm i'm thinking it wants the password
57:51 - that i use for um
57:55 - like to actually log in to
57:58 - the notion
58:01 - so
58:03 - let's try that
58:05 - see what we get
58:12 - so i'm going to grab the device id
58:20 - and i'm going to turn my device on
58:27 - and i'm gonna put in my email
58:37 - and then
58:38 - i'm gonna copy and paste my password
58:42 - or at least what i think the password
58:43 - would be
58:46 - uh
58:52 - um
59:04 - and let's see what happened
59:11 - wrong password hey cool
59:13 - like we got
59:15 - to get farther in the process
59:17 - all right let me try a new password then
59:33 - wait did that work
59:37 - did that really work
59:39 - i think it did
59:49 - all right that's cool let's check out
59:59 - yeah
60:00 - okay so this
60:12 - nice
60:14 - that worked
60:19 - sweet sweet sweet tweet all right cool
60:28 - all right so that worked
60:31 - um
60:35 - i didn't really expect that to work so
60:36 - quickly so what's the next step
60:39 - okay let's
60:40 - go back to the code here the next step
60:43 - is
60:46 - all right so
60:47 - now
60:51 - i guess we can say
60:54 - we need
60:55 - subscribe
60:57 - with the user
61:10 - or do we already have a user i think we
61:12 - do i think we've set
61:15 - yeah we've authenticated
61:17 - we've set the user yet because what's
61:19 - the second hook the second hook is user
61:21 - so we we saw that data we have that data
61:25 - now
61:27 - so this second hook here we have
61:31 - cool
61:32 - so
61:34 - since we have that
61:37 - we can look now at kind of like the next
61:39 - step
61:40 - uh
61:43 - so we have our code here
61:45 - let's see what we do next
61:52 - that's our calm stage so
61:56 - doing a subscription
61:58 - now the subscription that they're doing
62:00 - here is
62:03 - this
62:04 - notion.com subscribe to com we want to
62:07 - subscribe to
62:10 - focus
62:11 - so i think we can just
62:19 - let's grab
62:20 - some of this here
62:26 - yeah let's grab this
62:28 - and bring it in
62:35 - let's see
62:39 - all right so i'm gonna pull this in here
62:43 - so we should get then is
62:47 - everywhere we say calm i'm gonna change
62:49 - it to focus
63:09 - focus
63:10 - all right so we're gonna subscribe to
63:13 - the focus
63:16 - and for this
63:18 - i'm actually gonna
63:21 - let's see
63:23 - let me put this on
63:30 - okay
63:32 - so you can actually get some real
63:34 - brainwaves see if i can fit my
63:36 - headphones on top of it
63:37 - i actually can that's cool
63:40 - it's not very comfortable with these big
63:42 - headphones though
63:43 - uh all right cool
63:46 - so what i want to do i guess is
63:49 - um i don't want this to be
63:52 - actually yeah this could be a use effect
63:54 - so we'll just do it like that
63:56 - so this use effect will say
64:00 - yeah if there's no user or no notion
64:03 - then it's just going to return right but
64:05 - if we have both of these
64:07 - then
64:08 - we're actually going to run this we're
64:10 - going to get this this focus it's going
64:12 - to be a number and we want to display
64:14 - that
64:15 - so instead of this logged in
64:18 - i want to display
64:20 - focus
64:25 - all right uh in react if i put brackets
64:28 - in there then i can run javascript
64:30 - inside so this is gonna give me not the
64:32 - word focus but the value of
64:36 - focus in state so let's save that
64:39 - i'm gonna have to put in all my so like
64:41 - currently we're not saving any of the
64:43 - data
64:44 - uh so i'm gonna have to log in again
64:46 - but
64:49 - bear with me for a second while i get
64:51 - all this login stuff in again
64:57 - and
65:04 - uh what else
65:08 - password
65:30 - all right did that work
65:34 - uh did it did that not save
65:49 - oh
65:52 - didn't work this time what did i mess up
66:00 - first argument was invalid calm set
66:02 - sitcom
66:09 - what the heck
66:14 - i thought we'd get rid of all the calm
66:16 - stuff
66:19 - didn't we
66:24 - we did
66:25 - why is it still trying to set calm
67:04 - oh look at that all right so my column
67:06 - score right now
67:07 - is 0.51
67:11 - cool
67:12 - let's see if i can
67:21 - yeah there we go so it's updating so i
67:23 - lost focus there do you see me i looked
67:25 - over there
67:26 - and
67:27 - lost focus so this is giving me a
67:30 - real-time
67:32 - focus score
67:33 - basically like how focused i am
67:36 - um
67:39 - right
67:40 - now that
67:43 - that is pretty cool so this is
67:46 - um
67:50 - let me do
67:51 - focus
67:56 - yeah cool
67:58 - so i want to show you let me show you
68:00 - the screen
68:02 - so like this is the developer kind of
68:04 - console thing so you can see this is
68:06 - focus right it's like tracking
68:09 - uh my focus
68:11 - levels
68:12 - so like a higher number means i'm more
68:15 - focused this is between zero and one
68:22 - so what we've done here
68:26 - let me see if i could split screen it
68:29 - there we go
68:30 - so like these focus numbers it's it's
68:33 - right now it's reading the same feed
68:37 - so
68:38 - i guess like we've we've succeeded now
68:41 - at successfully connecting this to a
68:43 - react native app
68:45 - so
68:46 - i'm getting data from this brain
68:48 - computer interface headset it's going
68:50 - out to the neurocity servers
68:54 - right
68:55 - and then they're providing this api that
68:58 - i could subscribe to in my app that's
69:00 - giving me this this data
69:03 - so now we're getting real-time data
69:05 - about my level of focus
69:08 - in my brain
69:10 - in this react native app
69:12 - so that's pretty sweet the next step
69:14 - then would be hey
69:16 - alex who who built
69:18 - he's the co-founder of uh neurocity is
69:21 - watching the stream so awesome glad to
69:24 - have you here
69:25 - so um
69:28 - so like right now essentially like it
69:30 - works right we can connect this into
69:32 - react native the next step would be
69:34 - it's kind of a pain to have to log in
69:36 - every time right
69:37 - so it'd be nice if we could save this
69:39 - data somewhere locally on a user's
69:41 - machine
69:43 - so that
69:44 - it'll auto log you in
69:47 - so i'd say that's probably the next step
69:49 - that i'd like to do
69:51 - because that would really help save time
69:53 - because
69:54 - it
69:55 - you know it just takes a while to keep
69:57 - copy and paste in that every time we
69:59 - do something new and make a change
70:01 - so that's probably the next step that
70:02 - i'll do in in the next stream because i
70:04 - think yeah so i'm over the hour mark and
70:07 - i only wanted to take an an hour
70:09 - uh
70:10 - i don't want to take too much time away
70:12 - from my family here on on a sunday
70:14 - so um
70:17 - on the next stream we'll work on
70:20 - saving this in whatever version of local
70:23 - storage we need so on the web it would
70:25 - be the browser's local storage
70:27 - but on an
70:28 - ios or android device that would be
70:30 - different so we need to make sure we
70:32 - code it so that it'll work on whatever
70:34 - platform we're running on so it'll save
70:36 - that information
70:38 - so we don't have to log in every time
70:42 - then
70:43 - we can try to figure out
70:45 - some thresholds and say like all right
70:47 - let's say if i drop below a point two
70:51 - then it's going to do something
70:52 - right vibrate make a noise flash the
70:56 - screen it's gonna do something to warn
70:58 - us that our
70:59 - attention is dropping below the
71:02 - threshold that we set
71:03 - so uh i see that's that's probably a
71:06 - good
71:07 - a good next step also i think i would
71:09 - kind of want to um
71:12 - uh use maybe
71:16 - uh
71:18 - like a simulator right to make sure we
71:21 - can simulate what's happening on a uh on
71:23 - a mobile device
71:25 - uh so
71:26 - i can run it on my mobile phone but it'd
71:29 - be harder for you to see it i guess i
71:30 - could hold it up to the camera
71:32 - but i'm gonna see if i can maybe get
71:33 - like an android simulator running for
71:35 - the next time so we could do this also
71:38 - so alex in the chat says you could use
71:39 - react native async storage library which
71:42 - uh that's a great a um that's a great
71:44 - suggestion i actually contributed to the
71:47 - late the new version of react native
71:49 - async storage so
71:51 - uh i don't think it's out yet so if you
71:53 - use the react native community async
71:55 - storage uh package
71:58 - the uh the latest like development
72:01 - version
72:02 - has um a bunch of contributions that i
72:05 - did to get it to work with local storage
72:07 - in the browser
72:08 - so i'm actually i'm kind of proud of
72:10 - that because that was a lot of work and
72:12 - um
72:13 - i did do some live streams about that
72:15 - too so i think i put that on my channel
72:17 - if anybody's interested in how that
72:19 - works but
72:20 - uh all right cool so
72:23 - i'm just gonna leave this up on the
72:24 - screen for now
72:26 - just to kind of see like
72:27 - all the all the data going here
72:30 - um
72:31 - i'll leave i'll leave this as well
72:34 - um and then
72:37 - let me go back to the chat
72:39 - i'm going to get through the chat kind
72:40 - of quickly because i want to i don't
72:42 - want to stream too much longer i want to
72:44 - get back to my kids here
72:45 - um
72:47 - but i do want to answer some of your
72:48 - questions so i'm going to try to stream
72:51 - to answer your questions if i don't get
72:52 - to something put it in the comments and
72:55 - i'll try to get to it you can definitely
72:57 - like shoot me a dm on twitter or or
72:59 - something if you want to
73:00 - uh if i don't get your question but i'm
73:02 - going to try to get to as many as i can
73:07 - the genius marketer says do you
73:09 - recommend w3schools or what to get some
73:11 - code um
73:13 - if you're if you're trying to learn how
73:14 - to code uh check out free code camp uh
73:17 - so it's freecodecamp.org they've got an
73:19 - awesome curriculum
73:20 - um
73:21 - people have gone through the free code
73:23 - camp curriculum and have gotten jobs and
73:25 - stuff so
73:28 - i would definitely
73:29 - definitely check that out
73:31 - i wonder why my
73:33 - my focus stops
73:35 - maybe i move too much i don't know what
73:37 - i did
73:38 - uh but
73:43 - this one's still working though
73:45 - but yeah definitely check out free code
73:47 - camp that's that's a great place uh
73:49 - to go
73:58 - uh tom
73:59 - williams says his react native normal
74:01 - javascript or typescript you can use
74:03 - react native with normal javascript or
74:05 - typescript i chose to do it with
74:07 - typescript
74:08 - but you definitely could do regular
74:09 - javascript
74:11 - i just kind of recently got into
74:13 - typescript i've been using it at work so
74:16 - i'm
74:16 - trying to trying to use it more
74:19 - just to kind of really learn it well
74:23 - but you definitely don't have to use it
74:38 - let's see
74:44 - i see some of you were trying to um
74:47 - uh
74:48 - share your email addresses and it got
74:50 - blocked by the filter so i just i showed
74:52 - that so if you scroll back up in the
74:54 - chat those are visible now so you should
74:56 - be able to get them get them now
75:05 - all right there's a lot of cool
75:06 - discussion about programming languages
75:08 - in the chat so i'm not going to read it
75:10 - all out but
75:11 - i love it whenever there's great
75:12 - discussion from from you on the chat
75:20 - no beer says i'm hearing footsteps on
75:22 - the floor yeah those are my kids playing
75:24 - upstairs
75:25 - i actually had a contractor come in and
75:27 - look
75:28 - and talk to me about maybe getting a
75:30 - like a soundproof office to do these
75:32 - videos in and they're supposed to get
75:34 - back with me with an estimate
75:37 - i kind of expected it sooner i don't
75:40 - know it's taking so long but hopefully i
75:42 - can get like a legitimate kind of
75:44 - recording studio
75:45 - at some point and then
75:48 - uh
75:49 - should be a little bit better audio
75:50 - quality for these videos
76:03 - hey christa mars is here how's it going
76:05 - chris
76:07 - uh chris demars has a cool podcast that
76:10 - i did an episode on recently it's called
76:12 - tales from the script so uh check that
76:14 - out on i think it's it's on spotify i
76:17 - listen to it through uh google podcasts
76:20 - um
76:21 - so yeah check that out i'm sure it's
76:22 - available in all the different podcast
76:24 - services
76:25 - but um
76:27 - yeah he does a he does a great job
76:32 - yeah chris i'm doing good i was just
76:33 - doing a little bit of coding i'm kind of
76:35 - um
76:36 - wrapping it up oh yeah that's true and
76:38 - uh alex
76:39 - um who was
76:41 - he he was on the chat he's the
76:43 - co-founder of neurocity uh was also on
76:46 - the podcast as well so you can learn
76:47 - more about nerosity and the brain
76:49 - computer interface what they're trying
76:51 - to do
76:52 - and learn a little bit more about me if
76:53 - you want if you check out the podcast
76:56 - um so yeah chris chris just put in the
76:58 - chat he's on spotify google podcast
77:00 - apple podcast stitcher so
77:03 - all the podcast things
77:04 - um
77:06 - yeah check check him out
77:08 - let's see
77:10 - all right we got a question from big
77:11 - dodd it says i i got an exam in six
77:14 - months
77:15 - high school level and c plus plus for
77:17 - entering a college do you think i stand
77:18 - a chance i started learning c plus like
77:20 - two months ago but is there enough time
77:23 - uh you definitely have a chance you know
77:25 - it's hard to say like how long it'll
77:27 - take anyone but you know kind of depends
77:29 - on how much time you have to study but i
77:32 - you know don't don't quit on it i think
77:34 - you have a chance you know if you study
77:36 - hard at it
77:38 - you know especially if it's high school
77:40 - level i don't i don't really know what
77:41 - they would expect a high school student
77:43 - to know
77:45 - but if you have six months left and
77:47 - you've already been studying for two
77:48 - months i think you you got a good chance
77:50 - of doing well on the test
77:52 - i don't know i'd like to hear other
77:54 - people's opinions on this
77:56 - i i haven't done any c plus plus code
77:58 - except i took one c plus plus course
78:01 - a long time ago
78:03 - maybe like early 2000s
78:06 - um but i don't remember that much from
78:08 - it
78:09 - uh so
78:11 - probably not the best
78:13 - to ask about c plus plus but i i
78:15 - definitely think you could do it
78:17 - uh omor says sir you are awesome uh
78:21 - thanks i appreciate that he says thank
78:23 - you for your wisdom and time i have no
78:25 - idea how to code but i respect people
78:26 - who share their knowledge thank you yeah
78:28 - you're welcome welcome i'm
78:30 - uh happy to share it and
78:32 - um
78:33 - yeah hopefully you all get something out
78:35 - of this
78:37 - uh no beer says what's up jesse it's
78:39 - been a while for streaming how are you
78:40 - uh i'm doing all right i um
78:43 - uh i know it's been it's been a while i
78:46 - um
78:47 - to tell you the truth like
78:49 - i've had uh i had some weird health
78:51 - issues recently that we're kind of just
78:53 - like keeping me from doing a lot i
78:56 - i had like some scans done on my lung
78:58 - and they found some like black uh
79:01 - like shading like in the scans and turns
79:04 - out i had like nodules on my lung and i
79:07 - kept doing all these tests i couldn't
79:08 - figure out what it was
79:10 - so i wasn't that worried about it but it
79:12 - got me thinking like hey if this is
79:14 - something serious i want to spend as
79:16 - much time with my kids as i can so i
79:18 - kind of stopped doing any side projects
79:20 - or streaming or stuff and uh but it
79:23 - turns out i just saw a lung specialist
79:25 - this last week i don't think it's
79:26 - anything threatening he thinks that i
79:28 - have like uh allergies and asthma
79:31 - and um i found out i have sleep apnea so
79:34 - like
79:35 - i got a lot of stuff figured out but the
79:37 - good news is
79:39 - none of it is life-threatening right
79:40 - it's all it's all fine so
79:44 - um
79:45 - now i'm hoping like
79:47 - i'm hoping to be able to get back into
79:49 - streaming more because i really love
79:50 - doing this and uh i miss you know we we
79:53 - kind of had like a crew of people that
79:55 - would watch all the time and
79:57 - you know i missed that so
79:59 - anyway thanks for asking and uh
80:02 - you know i'm gonna try to
80:04 - i'm gonna try to do my i know i say this
80:06 - all the time but i'm gonna try to do my
80:07 - best to stream more
80:09 - either
80:10 - either through free code camp or maybe
80:12 - do some videos on my channel i think i'm
80:14 - gonna alternate a little bit uh but i
80:16 - definitely want to do this more
80:18 - and i'm having a lot of fun with this
80:20 - brain computer interface thing too this
80:22 - is kind of really cool
80:23 - and uh different than what like my
80:25 - day-to-day uh work
80:30 - let's see
80:33 - uh dylan says i don't get what you're
80:35 - trying to do
80:36 - uh
80:40 - basically i'm linking up for right now
80:42 - for what we did in this in this show i'm
80:45 - linking up this brain computer interface
80:47 - that i'm wearing with a react native app
80:49 - so that we can get data from this device
80:52 - into the app
80:54 - we're going to do some cool stuff with
80:55 - it but for right now we've just
80:57 - succeeded at getting the data so this
80:58 - little number we see here
81:00 - is actual like score
81:03 - on a a scale of
81:05 - zero to one of how focused i am right
81:07 - now
81:14 - oh cool krista morris says if they did a
81:15 - blood test and everything came back good
81:17 - then you were good yeah
81:19 - i'm not like i said i'm not worried um
81:22 - pretty much get everything figured out
81:24 - i'm i got to do some more tests
81:26 - and um this week
81:28 - because there was some stuff with my my
81:30 - liver that the doctor was worried about
81:32 - but to be honest with you i've been
81:34 - trying to work out a lot lately and i'm
81:35 - taking all these supplements and i think
81:37 - that was throwing off my blood tests
81:40 - a little bit so this whole week i've
81:42 - been taking off and just basically not
81:44 - working out not taking any supplements
81:46 - and
81:47 - uh i'm gonna redo the tests and see if
81:49 - that helps
81:50 - i'm expecting it will and then at that
81:52 - point i think basically
81:55 - everything that
81:57 - that uh was wrong with me will be at
81:59 - least explained
82:01 - um
82:02 - but uh
82:03 - yeah i think
82:05 - uh should be good i feel good
82:07 - and um
82:11 - so i figure i i feel good i feel in good
82:13 - shape the only thing that was weird for
82:14 - me was i kept getting out of breath
82:16 - really easily but
82:17 - it makes sense if i have asthma that
82:19 - totally explains it so
82:22 - um
82:24 - i mean it all like that it all makes
82:26 - sense and and i feel good so i have like
82:28 - uh an inhaler now that i could take if i
82:30 - feel out of breath so i'm gonna test it
82:32 - out probably
82:33 - you know maybe next time in the in the
82:35 - gym i'm gonna take my inhaler with me
82:37 - and then see if i like get do my normal
82:39 - workout
82:41 - and then see if i feel a big difference
82:42 - i'm expecting i'll probably be able to
82:44 - breathe a lot better but uh anyway
82:47 - uh i know some of you probably care
82:49 - about that and some of you are just here
82:50 - for the code so i'm not going to talk
82:52 - about it anymore like you all can ask me
82:54 - on social media if you want
82:57 - but anyway yeah i'm going to wrap things
82:58 - up now and go hang out with the kids a
83:00 - little bit before before bedtime
83:03 - and uh
83:04 - yeah it was really good uh i'd love to
83:07 - keep going with this project in some
83:08 - future streams uh let me know what you
83:10 - all think in the comments if you have
83:12 - questions
83:13 - um
83:14 - you know shoot them in the comments to
