00:56 - hi everyone welcome to another
01:00 - live stream
01:01 - um if you don't know me my name is gwen
01:04 - and i run another youtube channel called
01:07 - faraday academy where i do programming
01:11 - tutorials and live streams mostly mostly
01:14 - python and vue.js javascript topics
01:18 - so today is a continuation of building
01:22 - the free code camp projects live in
01:26 - vue.js so
01:29 - last week i did the markdown previewer
01:31 - and this week i'm going to go to the
01:33 - drum machine let me just zoom in here
01:36 - so these should be linked in the
01:37 - description below
01:40 - and you can go to my github which is at
01:42 - gwen f and this is called free code camp
01:45 - projects view and then i have each
01:47 - project in its own folder
01:50 - with a readme yeah so for today i'm
01:53 - going to be
01:55 - starting a view app with the vcli
01:57 - using incline which is a view ui
02:00 - framework
02:02 - for styling and design components that
02:05 - kind of thing
02:06 - and this is basically
02:08 - the
02:10 - um
02:11 - mock-up for the drum machine
02:13 - now i did find sounds for this already
02:15 - just because i didn't want to be
02:17 - scrounging for sounds here
02:19 - so i came up with these sounds that i
02:22 - edited
02:23 - myself but they're in the wrong format
02:26 - and won't play in the browser for some
02:27 - reason
02:28 - so i ended up
02:30 - getting some random sounds
02:33 - in this
02:34 - clip.js file here
02:36 - so they won't sound exactly like a drum
02:39 - so it's going to be more like a sound
02:40 - machine
02:42 - than a drum machine
02:45 - yeah
02:47 - that's a horse
02:48 - so if anyone has better sounds uh let me
02:51 - know but these were the easiest they're
02:53 - just mp3 files from sound bible
02:56 - which
02:57 - sound bible has all these um
03:00 - free sounds
03:02 - sometimes you have to give
03:03 - attribution and sometimes their
03:06 - public domain so it depends which sound
03:09 - just
03:10 - one second
03:13 - i'm gonna pull up the chat real quick
03:19 - and
03:29 - and
03:31 - okay
03:33 - good
03:34 - let me see
03:36 - who's here
03:38 - if you're here go ahead and say hi and
03:40 - feel free to
03:42 - give me comments or recommendations as
03:45 - i'm going along with the live stream
03:49 - this will be interesting because i
03:51 - generally don't work with
03:54 - sound
03:55 - in the browser when building
03:57 - applications but there's also a couple
03:59 - other applications i want to build with
04:00 - sound in the future like a music app so
04:04 - uh hopefully
04:07 - uh
04:08 - hey tech stats hi
04:10 - sassy
04:12 - uh yeah thanks for joining me feel free
04:14 - to
04:15 - um chime in as i'm programming today
04:19 - all right
04:20 - so
04:21 - yeah there's a couple other sound apps i
04:22 - want to build in the future so this
04:24 - should be
04:25 - a good project to
04:27 - i guess lean on later
04:29 - so first thing
04:31 - let me start here so first thing i need
04:33 - to create a view app so i already have
04:36 - the view cli installed
04:38 - so i'm going to do view
04:41 - create
04:45 - and let's call this
04:49 - drum machine i guess it's in a folder
04:51 - called drum machine so maybe i'll just
04:53 - call this
04:54 - drum app
05:00 - all right and it should give me my
05:01 - options yeah
05:03 - so
05:05 - let's see do i want anything let me just
05:07 - go into manual
05:10 - um
05:11 - do i want progressive web app support
05:14 - that's easy to add later
05:16 - i don't need routing it's just going to
05:18 - be one page this time
05:20 - view x
05:21 - don't think so
05:23 - do i want sass um i think i'll be okay
05:26 - without sass
05:29 - let me put it in just in case
05:31 - and i'm not gonna do testing
05:34 - so i'll use regular dart sass
05:39 - eslint i'm going to do just the basic
05:41 - island seems to go better in live
05:43 - streams when it's not
05:45 - giving me errors all the time
05:48 - lint on save
05:51 - yeah that's good
05:52 - and then i want dedicated config files
05:56 - save the preset no
05:59 - all right so that's installing
06:05 - what's the difference between sass and
06:07 - dart sass they're both implementations
06:09 - of sass
06:10 - i think dart sass is the most popular
06:12 - and i want to say it's the fastest
06:15 - but
06:16 - i'm not sure anymore
06:18 - um
06:19 - i think it's just what most people use
06:22 - like there was
06:24 - i guess ruby sass and
06:28 - a couple other projects sas built in
06:30 - different ways but it's the same
06:33 - implementation
06:34 - the only i guess the only two different
06:37 - types of sas are indented syntax and
06:40 - the
06:42 - scss style
06:45 - and those
06:46 - and you can use either of those styles
06:48 - with any of the
06:49 - implementations
06:55 - um
06:59 - all right
07:02 - should be done in a minute
07:20 - okay
07:25 - it's installing
07:35 - booking generators from the plug-ins
07:37 - that i installed
07:40 - which is just sas oh i guess i did
07:42 - babble too
07:46 - which is just one of the default ones
07:50 - i just launched to if you're interested
07:52 - in view cli plugins i just created a
07:54 - video on my channel faraday academy
07:57 - where i show how to create
07:59 - plugins and kind of how they work under
08:01 - the hood
08:03 - um it was pretty interesting for me to
08:05 - learn about so maybe you'd enjoy it too
08:08 - all right so now
08:10 - let's see
08:11 - now i have
08:14 - oh wow so
08:15 - drum machine
08:17 - i thought i was inside of drum machine
08:19 - already so drum app i'm going to move
08:21 - drum app inside of the drum machine
08:22 - folder now
08:24 - so
08:25 - let's see because all the other apps are
08:27 - inside of their their folders
08:30 - for that app
08:32 - so move drum machine to
08:35 - no move drum app to drum machine
08:40 - okay
08:42 - so now
08:43 - yeah i only have the three folders one
08:45 - for each project
08:46 - and now if i
08:48 - uh cd into drum machine
08:52 - cool i see drum app so let me open this
08:55 - in the code editor then
09:00 - go in here
09:02 - and then i'll also go ahead and cd into
09:06 - um drum app
09:10 - and then i'm going to start my view
09:12 - server
09:13 - so
09:14 - npm run server
09:23 - all right and that always takes a minute
09:24 - to build
09:29 - and let me put my browser in the middle
09:31 - all right
09:32 - so now that's building and actually
09:34 - first i'm going to install the
09:37 - incline library
09:39 - and probably the best way to do that is
09:41 - through
09:42 - the cli install
09:44 - so
09:45 - i'll just add this
09:48 - real quick so
09:51 - then i'm gonna have to rerun
09:54 - uh uncommitted changes yeah that's fine
10:02 - okay
10:03 - so that should only take a second to
10:05 - install
10:06 - and set it up for me
10:08 - what's nice about using the vue cli
10:11 - plugins is that they set up all the
10:12 - configuration
10:14 - so i can just start
10:16 - using the components without setting
10:18 - anything else up
10:22 - okay so
10:24 - first thing i'm going to do is set up
10:26 - the grid
10:28 - so
10:31 - let me go to the drum machine mock-up
10:34 - so it's a pretty simple mock-up i just
10:36 - want
10:37 - basically this box to be centered and
10:39 - then i want a panel on top
10:42 - that i guess has some controls like you
10:44 - can turn it off and on
10:46 - there's some volume
10:48 - in the name of the sound that's being
10:50 - played which i just gave them names and
10:52 - objects so that have a name
10:56 - and then
10:58 - each one of these
11:00 - panels or buttons or whatever they're
11:02 - going to be
11:03 - um
11:04 - when you click on it it'll make that
11:05 - sound
11:08 - um okay
11:10 - successfully invoked okay so now incline
11:14 - is installed i don't think i need to
11:16 - install anything else right now so i'm
11:17 - just going to do
11:19 - npm run serve to start the development
11:21 - server
11:22 - and then i'll be able to see my app
11:25 - localhost
11:27 - 8080.
11:33 - okay
11:34 - and in my source directory i want these
11:37 - clips this clips.js file so i'm just
11:39 - going to drag that in here
11:42 - let's see yeah i'll just put it in the
11:44 - root for now
11:47 - um
11:51 - all right
11:52 - let me see
11:55 - and my server's not running
11:58 - let's see
11:59 - module build failed
12:01 - compound selectors
12:03 - may no longer be extended
12:08 - hmm okay so this is
12:14 - an
12:15 - incline problem
12:17 - i already have an error
12:18 - but where is this coming from
12:22 - um it's coming from the actual incline
12:25 - components
12:28 - so in the node modules i don't know if
12:30 - there's anything i can do about it
12:33 - except maybe
12:34 - downgrade my version of incline
12:38 - balsamic
12:40 - so let me see
12:41 - balsamic
12:43 - balsamic mock-ups is i think it's a
12:46 - super easy
12:47 - tool for
12:48 - developers people who aren't
12:50 - professional designers to just quickly
12:52 - make mock-ups they have an online
12:54 - version now
12:55 - um
12:57 - but
12:58 - i have the desktop app because i like it
13:00 - a little bit better
13:02 - but they both work i think the online
13:03 - one's a subscription model
13:06 - okay so
13:09 - root style sheet
13:12 - consider extend to
13:17 - yeah so this is a problem inside of the
13:20 - incline library let me go to their
13:23 - github page
13:26 - and look at their issues and see what
13:27 - people are doing i'm sure someone else
13:29 - has had that issue
13:31 - because that's literally the first thing
13:32 - i did when i set up the app
13:40 - i wonder
13:44 - let's see
13:46 - yeah let me copy this
13:48 - component selectors may no longer be
13:50 - extended
13:57 - okay
13:59 - so this is a recent issue
14:04 - yeah it seems like it's the same thing
14:06 - that i'm having
14:09 - this shouldn't be happening on a clean
14:11 - installation
14:14 - which version of node sas
14:18 - okay
14:19 - so
14:22 - what i might do actually
14:26 - is
14:30 - all right
14:32 - so let me see
14:37 - read me
14:40 - saurus public okay
14:43 - um
14:44 - let me see
14:47 - so it's setting up incline importing
14:49 - incline components registering them
14:53 - so what i might do is
14:56 - i could just uninstall incline
15:00 - and then get rid of the plug-in
15:03 - and then manually add it because what
15:06 - might be causing the error
15:08 - is
15:10 - let's see
15:13 - let me go back to getting started
15:17 - is that i
15:18 - gave it this customizable flag
15:23 - oh let's see and its dependencies have
15:25 - been added to your package.json
15:28 - node sas and sas loader let me just
15:30 - check the versions of those real quick
15:35 - let's see
15:39 - um sass loader and node sas
15:44 - okay
15:47 - and then
15:49 - yeah i have incline
15:52 - and of course the plug-in that installed
15:54 - incline
16:03 - so it's a sas problem okay
16:06 - so i wonder
16:08 - if i restart all of this
16:14 - and i'm going to try this out again
16:15 - later to see if i should open a bug or a
16:18 - new issue with this
16:21 - uh because i literally didn't do
16:23 - anything after
16:24 - i set this app up so it shouldn't be
16:26 - giving me an error already
16:31 - okay so
16:34 - if
16:40 - shaking
16:42 - let me look at the getting started
16:50 - i wonder if i just do this instead
16:55 - if i'm not
16:57 - importing certain components or passing
16:59 - in any options
17:01 - what that's going to do
17:05 - it's rebuilding
17:09 - nope it's still doing it
17:11 - so yeah it's a sass problem
17:16 - so i wonder if i should be using ink
17:18 - line
17:19 - i just used this in the last project and
17:21 - it worked totally fine
17:23 - so
17:25 - all right so i guess i'm going to be
17:26 - using a different framework
17:29 - um let me try
17:32 - um
17:34 - view bootstrap that should work
17:40 - and we can start all over again
17:42 - read this solution in a github issue
17:47 - you mean on incline
17:52 - i think i went i didn't see any of the
17:54 - issues
17:58 - that had to do with mine it was just
18:00 - that one closed issue where there was no
18:02 - solution
18:05 - oh if you tried to post a link i don't
18:07 - think free code camp is letting you post
18:09 - a link so i can't see it
18:11 - um can you just tell give me the issue
18:13 - number
18:15 - and
18:17 - okay
18:18 - and point
18:20 - node sas from the webpack
18:23 - like this conses equals require node sas
18:29 - let me see
18:30 - let me look at the issue
18:37 - customizing not working
18:41 - um okay let me see
18:45 - is issue 170
18:54 - oh this is a next though
18:59 - getting a compile error
19:01 - module
19:02 - whoops module build failed
19:09 - bug report okay
19:12 - yeah this is what i have okay
19:14 - yeah this is the same issue though
19:18 - so i don't know which one it's which
19:20 - issue unless you give me an issue number
19:22 - i had to remove sas default dart sas
19:26 - to point at node sas
19:28 - um
19:30 - let's see
19:32 - transpiling dependencies
19:37 - i could
19:38 - point it i don't know do i want to do
19:40 - this i kind of want to start just
19:42 - building the drum app i think for this
19:45 - um i can change it later but
19:48 - i think right now i'm just going to use
19:50 - bootstrap view
19:51 - until i figure out
19:53 - what's wrong with incline
19:57 - [Music]
20:02 - and i don't believe
20:06 - i believe this is just an npm install
20:11 - let's see
20:14 - yeah so it's
20:16 - it's not recommending me to
20:22 - you are using okay so i have to install
20:24 - bootstrap view and bootstrap okay
20:29 - icons plugin
20:32 - all right
20:33 - so let me just install this real quick
20:37 - and this will just i just need a basic
20:39 - grid system and some styling that's
20:46 - it okay
20:49 - um
20:50 - that's installing
20:52 - so there's no plugin i just have to
20:55 - set it up in my
20:57 - view file
20:59 - in my main
21:00 - view file where i render from
21:03 - so main.js
21:05 - and i'll put it in here
21:10 - okay
21:12 - and then
21:13 - i guess i'll just get rid of these and i
21:17 - could uninstall
21:19 - incline from here
21:24 - and install incline and the plug-in
21:32 - okay cool that installed just fine so
21:34 - i'm gonna do an npm uninstall
21:37 - the plugin
21:39 - and
21:42 - uh
21:44 - let's see
21:46 - ink line
21:53 - view is imported twice now
21:56 - i might have done that yeah
21:58 - okay
22:00 - thank you
22:02 - and actually
22:04 - i'm gonna change the order of those
22:05 - imports
22:08 - all right
22:11 - and now
22:12 - okay so import bootstrap view and then
22:17 - just view dot use
22:20 - okay let me do bootstrap view
22:24 - and then if i want icons later i'll do
22:25 - that
22:30 - okay
22:31 - and now i'll do npm
22:34 - run serve
22:37 - and i think
22:39 - so incline's a pretty lightweight
22:42 - um
22:44 - library so i don't think it gave me
22:46 - extra setup like some of the
22:50 - larger ui libraries did yeah i don't see
22:54 - its own folder or anything here
22:56 - so i think i got rid of it
23:01 - yeah it doesn't even change the setup in
23:03 - the app.view file okay
23:07 - icon's plugin is defined but never used
23:09 - yeah
23:11 - all right so
23:14 - um
23:16 - i'll just add it
23:20 - okay so that built
23:23 - okay cool
23:24 - it's working now
23:26 - and i guess i'll just be using the
23:29 - view bootstrap system
23:33 - um
23:35 - okay so
23:37 - components
23:38 - actually i think
23:41 - grid yeah layout and grid system
23:45 - so
23:46 - it's basically all prefixed from b
23:48 - container b row
23:50 - and
23:51 - just by
23:54 - i think this gives me all the components
23:56 - like i don't have to individually
23:58 - import and register components because i
24:00 - just registered the whole library
24:02 - so let me try out i'll just start
24:04 - programming in
24:06 - my main file
24:08 - my main app.view file and then i'm going
24:10 - to break up
24:11 - components as i need them
24:14 - break things up into components
24:17 - let me get rid of all this styling too
24:22 - okay
24:23 - so
24:26 - first thing i'm going to do is a v
24:28 - container
24:29 - to start off my grid system and then
24:33 - uh oh wait it's b
24:35 - i'm getting all these
24:37 - uh libraries confused
24:39 - so for bootstrap it's b
24:43 - and
24:44 - b okay and then
24:47 - it will be
24:48 - b
24:49 - row inside
24:52 - and then
24:55 - b
24:57 - column
24:59 - i think it's just call
25:02 - yeah be call
25:04 - okay
25:08 - and then here is where i can put it in
25:11 - the middle of the page so let me put
25:12 - something in here first
25:14 - just some text
25:17 - okay drum
25:19 - and now from here
25:21 - i can give it the
25:22 - regular classes
25:25 - so
25:26 - or maybe there are props here
25:28 - let me
25:29 - look in
25:30 - columns
25:34 - yeah so i'll pass it in as a prop
25:37 - instead of as a class
25:39 - so
25:41 - i'll do column for so this will just be
25:44 - for all screen sizes so six six columns
25:47 - wide
25:48 - and then
25:49 - how do i do offset
25:52 - okay offset equals
25:54 - so
25:55 - i think i can just do offset equals
25:57 - three
26:03 - all right so that didn't work
26:06 - um
26:08 - so first let me see if there's an error
26:10 - here
26:14 - uh type checked for prop
26:17 - call
26:18 - expected boolean got string
26:21 - with value of
26:22 - six um oh i think it's calls isn't it
26:28 - i think it is calls let me see
26:32 - yeah calls
26:34 - so
26:36 - here
26:37 - calls
26:44 - okay so that didn't give me an error but
26:47 - it's still
26:51 - let me just see
26:53 - if i inspect this
26:55 - let me inspect the text
27:01 - okay
27:02 - so row container
27:06 - [Music]
27:07 - class
27:15 - of column six
27:17 - and
27:19 - i wonder why
27:21 - they have examples they don't really
27:23 - have
27:24 - oh they do okay
27:27 - um
27:30 - let's see
27:32 - yeah this one says calls eight
27:37 - so i should be able to do that let's see
27:39 - i have
27:40 - b column
27:42 - so
27:43 - b call b call
27:45 - and then calls of six and then oh my
27:48 - offset is wrong
27:49 - ah
27:52 - yeah thank you
27:56 - that's so strong okay
28:06 - it's still not working
28:08 - um
28:09 - so let's see offset
28:12 - why wouldn't offset be working
28:16 - did i have an example with offset
28:25 - they do have
28:27 - [Music]
28:29 - auto so i think that centers it
28:35 - and
28:38 - alignment
28:40 - i guess that's flexbox
28:44 - so you can use flexbox
28:50 - let's see
28:52 - all right so offset let me just try to
28:55 - do
28:57 - um instead of just general calls let me
28:59 - try to do a small
29:01 - and then i can do
29:04 - offset hyphen
29:06 - small
29:10 - see if that works
29:17 - that's weird
29:22 - recall
29:24 - medium offset medium
29:27 - i'm closing the column
29:30 - uh
29:31 - all right so let me put content in here
29:33 - and see if i just
29:35 - if something else is going to
29:39 - change it i guess
29:41 - because that's weird
29:45 - yeah i'm doing it exactly like the
29:47 - examples say let me even copy paste
29:51 - the example
29:54 - and
29:57 - let me do another row so
30:03 - all right
30:04 - oh wait i wanted to put a row in here so
30:06 - b row
30:10 - and then
30:13 - let's see
30:19 - maybe the css is not being loaded
30:22 - correctly
30:24 - yeah that's true because it's not
30:26 - working at all
30:28 - does it say because i didn't think it
30:30 - said i thought
30:32 - um
30:34 - let's see
30:48 - oh it does say to add imports
30:51 - so
30:52 - add import
30:54 - bootstrap view
30:57 - okay
31:04 - so let me put this in the main.js file
31:09 - and that should fix it
31:13 - ah
31:14 - okay
31:16 - all right that was
31:18 - a lot of time spent on that
31:20 - thanks for the help okay let me get rid
31:22 - of that extra row then
31:25 - okay
31:27 - and
31:29 - yeah
31:30 - oh man i guess i've
31:34 - like i'm so used to setting it up
31:36 - um
31:37 - setting up component libraries
31:40 - just by using
31:41 - a plugin so i do view add and then it
31:44 - sets it up for me so i forgot i can't
31:47 - believe i forgot to check for the css
31:50 - um all right so now
31:52 - finally i have the drum machine so this
31:54 - is actually going to be
31:56 - two cards
31:58 - so
31:59 - the top card and the bottom card with
32:01 - the
32:02 - um
32:03 - sound buttons oops
32:06 - with the sound buttons or whatever these
32:08 - are inside
32:09 - so
32:10 - let me look for cards here
32:18 - okay cards
32:20 - so just a basic card
32:23 - and then i guess i can nest inside the
32:25 - cards with text or just
32:28 - put components directly inside
32:33 - all right so
32:34 - let me just start off with the basic
32:35 - card
32:37 - so
32:39 - b card
32:41 - and then close it
32:44 - and then oh yeah second one
32:48 - so now i have two
32:50 - and
32:52 - let's see let me start to put
32:55 - the controls inside
32:58 - so
32:58 - actually
32:59 - i put volume in the mock-up here but i
33:01 - have no idea how to do sound volume in
33:04 - the browser
33:05 - so
33:07 - yeah i'll have to figure that out um
33:10 - power should be easy just make it work
33:12 - or not work
33:14 - and then the sound name should be easy
33:16 - so let me
33:18 - uh let's see
33:21 - so let me do
33:22 - what do you call those things switches
33:26 - switch style
33:28 - uh check box
33:33 - um
33:37 - yeah that looks okay i don't know why
33:39 - it's so small
33:46 - oh that goes into other so here are just
33:48 - the switches
33:51 - this
33:54 - okay so i can put a prop large i'm
33:56 - definitely going to put a prop large on
33:57 - that
33:59 - so it's just a prop that denotes it as a
34:02 - switch
34:03 - so it's a regular checkbox and then you
34:06 - pass it a switch prop and it makes it a
34:08 - switch
34:10 - okay so
34:12 - oh cool and then it'll just give me the
34:14 - label so i guess i'll put the label to
34:15 - the right that's fine
34:18 - um
34:20 - i'm not really picky about that
34:23 - so
34:24 - a lot a large switch and i'll call it
34:26 - the power switch
34:30 - so let's see
34:32 - cool so that switches on and off
34:38 - all right
34:40 - um
34:43 - now what was the next one oh a slider
34:46 - for volume so let me try to find a
34:48 - slider
34:52 - do i call it a slider
34:55 - um
34:56 - it's not a carousel
34:58 - i mean it would be in forms
35:00 - somewhere maybe if i scroll does anyone
35:04 - know what that's called
35:11 - which is
35:18 - all right maybe
35:19 - i mean view bootstrap might just not
35:21 - have that
35:24 - so
35:28 - how else would you control volume just
35:30 - up and down
35:33 - i guess we could skip the volume for now
35:35 - and then if we needed it we could add in
35:37 - another library that has a slider
35:40 - on it
35:41 - that wouldn't be a big deal yeah it
35:43 - seems like it doesn't have it unless
35:44 - it's in one of these other
35:47 - um
35:49 - ones rating is stars right
35:52 - yeah
35:53 - it's kind of cool
35:55 - um
35:56 - time picker input group
35:58 - check box
36:04 - bar spinner
36:08 - yeah i don't see one here oh well
36:10 - oh is it called range
36:17 - oh range type input
36:21 - okay
36:23 - oh they do have one cool
36:30 - all right
36:31 - is this the only example they have
36:34 - oh with different step values
36:37 - okay
36:38 - yeah the basic one is is good
36:41 - so basically
36:43 - it's a b form input
36:45 - and then give it a type of range
36:47 - all right
36:55 - okay i'll just put it after
36:58 - the power and see how that looks
37:00 - so
37:03 - id range
37:07 - um i don't even think i'll need an id
37:08 - here
37:14 - um
37:15 - v model i'm gonna have to set up the v
37:17 - models
37:18 - min max
37:21 - that's fine okay
37:23 - so let me see
37:26 - all right
37:28 - that looks okay
37:30 - um
37:31 - i wonder now should i put
37:35 - the volume i guess i could put
37:38 - the volume
37:40 - yeah
37:41 - make it a lot smaller and put it next to
37:43 - sound because you really don't need the
37:45 - whole width
37:46 - for volume unless i put volume at the
37:48 - bottom
37:49 - and put power
37:51 - and the sound title here
37:53 - and then
37:54 - put volume below it
37:56 - um
37:58 - let's see
38:00 - also
38:01 - if i pass in
38:05 - if i pass something into the form input
38:08 - component
38:10 - um
38:11 - that probably won't be a label
38:13 - yeah because it's not like a checkbox
38:15 - so
38:17 - let me try to
38:22 - i'll make that self-closing
38:24 - and maybe i can pass in a label
38:27 - which is
38:29 - volume
38:31 - okay
38:36 - nope doesn't take label
38:38 - so
38:41 - it doesn't have a list of props here
38:47 - no range inputs
38:49 - return their value as a string you may
38:51 - need to convert the value yeah
38:55 - does not include styling for range
38:56 - inputs inside input groups however
38:59 - bootstrap u includes custom styling to
39:02 - handle these situations until styling is
39:04 - included in bootstrap
39:06 - okay so bootstrap 5 just came out so i'm
39:09 - guessing bootstrap 5 has styling for
39:10 - this
39:11 - i think maybe it's still in alpha i'm
39:13 - not sure
39:14 - anyway
39:15 - uh
39:17 - let me add the
39:18 - box here to show the name first and then
39:20 - i'll figure out what i'm gonna do
39:22 - with
39:24 - the volume where i'm gonna put it i
39:26 - guess
39:28 - i saw a library on github
39:31 - vue bootstrap slider
39:33 - yeah i thought some people called it
39:35 - slider i feel like i've used it as a
39:37 - slider before
39:41 - or maybe it's like the whole
39:43 - dialogue modal thing everyone's starting
39:45 - to call it a dialogue and we seem to be
39:48 - losing the name modal to standardize it
39:52 - um
39:53 - okay
39:55 - b
39:55 - form input
39:58 - uh
39:59 - and then i guess
40:01 - so i guess i'll be putting rows and
40:02 - columns inside of this card
40:05 - so
40:06 - if i do a b row
40:10 - here
40:12 - and close the b row
40:15 - and then
40:16 - let me put a check box
40:18 - or not a check box let me put the
40:22 - name box
40:24 - inside this row and then
40:27 - um
40:30 - let's see also this is this is quite
40:32 - zoomed in if i zoom out a little bit
40:34 - it's more accurate
40:36 - so let me put uh
40:39 - i don't know a div do they have
40:43 - paper i'm not sure if they have
40:46 - um
40:49 - paper so what do i do if i want this
40:53 - with
40:54 - like a just a regular box
40:58 - like an outline box without
41:01 - using another card element
41:05 - so in beautify they have something
41:07 - called paper
41:11 - and i'm not sure
41:13 - i guess i can just style it myself
41:17 - that might be the easiest thing to do
41:24 - okay i'm just gonna
41:26 - style it just make a box a regular div
41:31 - and i'm gonna call
41:32 - it class equals
41:35 - name box
41:38 - search for border
41:40 - so borders are the classes they have
41:42 - right for borders
41:46 - um
41:49 - sidebar styling borders
41:53 - border border
41:58 - yeah these are utility classes for
41:59 - borders
42:02 - so
42:05 - border right border danger
42:08 - those ones
42:10 - okay so i can still make my own div here
42:14 - and
42:16 - might not have to do a custom class
42:18 - because then i can just use their
42:20 - utility classes for spacing too
42:23 - um
42:25 - so what is this
42:26 - let me let me just put a placeholder
42:29 - here sound name
42:31 - and here
42:35 - let's see
42:37 - let me get out of components
42:43 - so where are their utility classes
42:46 - let me search
42:48 - bootstrap for utility classes
42:57 - okay so this
42:59 - shows these are utility classes from for
43:02 - spacing
43:04 - um
43:06 - inside the layout grid system okay
43:09 - so where would the
43:13 - maybe these utility classes
43:15 - yeah border utilities
43:18 - okay it takes me to the actual bootstrap
43:21 - so okay so i guess i just
43:24 - use the these classes from bootstrap
43:28 - um
43:30 - so i can do border
43:32 - and then i don't think i want border
43:34 - danger or anything
43:39 - okay cool it gave me a border
43:41 - and now i can add some margin or padding
43:44 - classes
43:46 - so let me do padding
43:49 - all
43:51 - now let me do padding
43:53 - let's see on the x axis
43:56 - of
43:58 - four
43:59 - boost strap
44:01 - has a funky way of calculating
44:04 - padding and margin
44:07 - that isn't just multiplying
44:09 - so i think four is something like 16
44:12 - pixels or close to it maybe
44:15 - and then this should be something around
44:17 - six or eight pixels
44:19 - okay i think that looks pretty good for
44:21 - a box
44:22 - but
44:24 - it's not at all aligned here
44:27 - so
44:29 - what i could do is add
44:32 - some
44:34 - i guess css or
44:37 - um
44:39 - what do i call that flexbox classes
44:44 - inside the row
44:47 - um
44:50 - so let me see let me add a class
44:53 - of
44:54 - and actually this row i don't know if
44:57 - the rows default to display flex already
45:01 - let me see
45:07 - let me look inside row
45:09 - yeah it's already defaulting
45:11 - to display flex
45:15 - yeah thanks
45:16 - so i don't need to put
45:18 - display flex in here so i can i think i
45:21 - can just use
45:22 - flex
45:23 - um
45:24 - elements now
45:26 - so i could do
45:28 - um
45:30 - what is it justify
45:34 - um
45:35 - justify content oh it's giving me all of
45:38 - them cool
45:39 - uh justify content space between is the
45:41 - one i want
45:42 - so let me start typing justify content
45:46 - space
45:47 - between
45:50 - and oh it gave me an underscore did he
45:52 - start with underscores
45:56 - why did i do that i don't know if i did
45:59 - that
46:02 - okay so it said the row already has
46:05 - display flex but maybe it doesn't let me
46:07 - try
46:08 - if that makes a difference
46:13 - no so
46:14 - uh let me get rid of that
46:19 - okay
46:21 - um so does anyone know
46:23 - why this isn't pushing let me look in
46:25 - the dev tools
46:28 - and see
46:31 - okay so
46:35 - in the div
46:38 - okay so here
46:41 - display flex flex wrap
46:46 - and
46:52 - it's not
46:53 - justified content so the class isn't
46:56 - correct
46:57 - then
47:00 - so let me go into the bootstrap
47:05 - flex classes
47:10 - oh i guess this would be in the
47:12 - utility classes as well
47:15 - so let me look in regular bootstrap for
47:18 - flex
47:19 - utilities
47:23 - um
47:25 - so where is it justify content
47:29 - there
47:31 - and justify content okay so it's just
47:34 - justify content between
47:40 - so
47:41 - oh i put space between
47:44 - okay
47:47 - sweet okay that works
47:50 - um
47:52 - all right that's pretty good
47:54 - now
47:57 - i do want to add some margin to the row
48:00 - just in general and also to the card
48:03 - because it's pushed up against
48:04 - everything else
48:05 - so i'm going to add some
48:07 - um
48:09 - oh wait i think i have to put it inside
48:11 - a class so margin all
48:15 - or margin top of
48:18 - four
48:19 - let's see
48:21 - okay that's good that pushes the top
48:22 - card down
48:24 - and
48:26 - um
48:28 - let's see i'd also want a margin i guess
48:31 - for each card i'll just add a margin top
48:33 - margin top
48:36 - class equals margin top of four
48:42 - okay that looks pretty good
48:44 - and i don't want
48:46 - these to be so close to the edges
48:49 - so let me add
48:51 - a margin
48:53 - let's see
48:55 - i guess to the row here
48:57 - so
48:58 - i can add a
49:00 - margin more uh
49:03 - margin on the
49:05 - x-axis
49:07 - of
49:10 - two
49:13 - okay that looks much better
49:17 - all right so i have the sound name i
49:19 - have the power bar and then i like
49:20 - volume being below that was too many
49:22 - things squished into one row but i need
49:25 - some kind of a title for it
49:28 - um let me put it in its own row first
49:32 - so it matches the rest of the content so
49:34 - b
49:35 - row
49:38 - b row
49:42 - okay
49:44 - and now
49:47 - i have the input
49:48 - so i guess i will want an id actually if
49:51 - i'm going to give it a label
49:53 - so the id will just be
49:56 - volume i guess
49:58 - oops
49:59 - volume
50:00 - and then
50:03 - label
50:04 - for
50:07 - volume
50:09 - okay
50:11 - and then
50:16 - um yeah just volume inside the label
50:23 - all right and then i wanted to give this
50:24 - the same kind of margin spacing that i
50:27 - gave to the top row
50:29 - so
50:30 - i'll add
50:32 - class
50:34 - equals
50:36 - m
50:36 - [Music]
50:38 - x of 2 and then i want some margin top
50:42 - between the top row as well
50:44 - so let me see how that looks
50:48 - actually i want more margin
50:51 - between the top row
50:54 - okay cool i think that looks pretty good
50:56 - what do you think
50:59 - and
51:00 - yeah
51:01 - and now i need the buttons
51:03 - in
51:04 - the bottom card
51:07 - so let me see
51:10 - b row b card
51:14 - okay so in this card i want to do
51:17 - did i get rid of my class here i thought
51:19 - i had a class of margin i guess i got
51:22 - rid of it at some point
51:23 - margin top of four
51:26 - and now i want to have
51:30 - basically square boxes
51:33 - that
51:34 - are displayed
51:36 - i'm going to be looping through them too
51:38 - so i'm going to want some kind of flex
51:40 - wrap so that i can loop through them all
51:44 - so let's see
51:48 - yeah
51:49 - thanks
51:50 - um
51:52 - so it's basically like the first hour
51:54 - trying to get
51:55 - the styling set up in the second hour
51:58 - actually doing the vjs work
52:01 - um okay so let me just i guess just
52:05 - create squares
52:07 - right there's no like
52:08 - actual square class
52:11 - somewhere
52:12 - um
52:13 - eventually it would be cool to have one
52:15 - icon
52:16 - in each button
52:19 - but
52:21 - uh
52:23 - should they be buttons
52:25 - i guess they should be buttons even
52:27 - though they're square not rectangle i
52:29 - think it would make sense so i'm
52:30 - guessing it's b
52:34 - btn maybe
52:37 - let's see
52:39 - where are the buttons
52:44 - it's been a while since i used bootstrap
52:48 - i think it has i don't remember the last
52:50 - time i did
52:51 - oh by the way one thing i found the
52:53 - other day
52:54 - someone sent me i think
52:56 - is
52:59 - boot swatch
53:02 - it was
53:03 - they have all these free themes for
53:06 - bootstrap
53:07 - and there are also components and other
53:09 - things
53:10 - which i thought was pretty cool
53:13 - that you can just use any of these
53:14 - things to make bootstrap look a lot
53:16 - nicer
53:19 - uh yeah maybe if i
53:20 - make this drum app look nice i might use
53:22 - one
53:23 - alright
53:24 - so here's a button okay so it's spelled
53:26 - out
53:27 - b
53:28 - button
53:30 - and then i can give it a variant
53:33 - if i want i'll probably have outlined
53:35 - buttons maybe
53:37 - um
53:38 - so it's
53:40 - b button and then
53:44 - um let me just close it for now and then
53:46 - i'll put
53:50 - sound or
53:51 - x or
53:53 - i don't know
53:55 - let's see
53:57 - let's see how that looks okay
54:01 - okay that's actually square
54:03 - so we're kind of square anyway
54:05 - now
54:06 - let me make that
54:08 - bigger maybe if i just add enough
54:11 - padding
54:12 - that will come out to be a big square
54:14 - button
54:16 - so class equals
54:21 - although if i had a div i would just set
54:23 - the size of it
54:25 - instead of
54:27 - the padding
54:29 - so padding all
54:31 - four
54:36 - um does it like that
54:40 - did i
54:41 - yeah i gave it the correct padding you
54:43 - know what i don't think button is the is
54:45 - the right thing for this
54:47 - i think i'm going to use a div
54:50 - div
54:52 - and then
54:54 - i'll just put an x inside
54:57 - because that way it's not dependent on
54:59 - what's inside of it for spacing
55:02 - versus just padding a button
55:05 - so let me do
55:07 - class equals
55:09 - padding oh i guess i'm padding this too
55:12 - i'm going to just set the side is the
55:14 - size of these
55:15 - so let's do class
55:18 - um sound
55:24 - sound button
55:26 - i don't know
55:28 - okay so sound button and now in my style
55:32 - tag
55:33 - i can style
55:36 - sound
55:37 - button
55:40 - and
55:43 - padding all
55:44 - okay bootstrap does p4
55:47 - all right thanks
55:49 - um
55:51 - so i'm gonna do width
55:54 - of
55:55 - 50 pixels
55:57 - height is 50 pixels
56:00 - because i want to set absolute heights
56:02 - and widths on these
56:05 - okay so i can tell it got bigger
56:10 - just by
56:13 - why isn't it
56:15 - yeah
56:16 - that's 50 by 50. so this is actually
56:18 - going to have to be like 200 by 200.
56:21 - um
56:25 - 50 is not very big
56:27 - 200 pixels
56:28 - oh did i get rid of pixels
56:30 - okay
56:31 - so 200 by 200
56:35 - and then i'm gonna need to
56:38 - make the parent here
56:42 - so
56:44 - um this should already be
56:47 - oh no this is inside a card so what i'm
56:50 - going to do now is do a b row because i
56:52 - want to wrap
56:54 - all the buttons so i can loop through
56:55 - them
56:56 - and then i think b row has
57:00 - not just flex display flex set but i
57:02 - think it has
57:04 - um
57:05 - flex that row wrap so it'll just wrap
57:08 - the containers around
57:12 - all right
57:14 - so
57:18 - inside of the row
57:22 - and now i'll do
57:26 - i'm still gonna want
57:28 - i guess justify
57:30 - content center
57:37 - okay
57:38 - and then
57:42 - let me start looping through something
57:44 - here to display these buttons
57:47 - so let me import clips
57:49 - into this file
57:51 - so let me import because i'm exporting
57:55 - this array of objects from clips
57:58 - so
57:59 - it's not json or anything so i can just
58:01 - import
58:04 - that array so clips from
58:08 - clips
58:12 - and then
58:14 - let's see
58:18 - clips let me put it on data here so
58:25 - let's
58:25 - make a data function
58:28 - turn
58:29 - the object
58:31 - and
58:33 - do the clips array
58:35 - so now there should be nine clips in
58:37 - that file if i counted correctly
58:40 - so now i can
58:42 - inside this sound button
58:45 - i can let me put it on a few rows
58:52 - i can do v4
58:54 - equals
58:58 - clip
58:59 - in clips
59:02 - and then
59:03 - the key i'm just going to use
59:06 - clip dot name
59:10 - which all of them are unique so because
59:12 - i already know that
59:16 - cool so it's a little bit off but
59:21 - it's displaying nine of them let me make
59:23 - these
59:25 - uh a little bit smaller
59:28 - so
59:29 - let me try
59:33 - 160
59:37 - 160.
59:41 - okay i think that's okay if i center
59:44 - them and spread them out a little bit
59:47 - and now let me add a border so i can
59:49 - actually see where they are
59:51 - so
59:52 - class i'm going to add a border here
59:58 - cool i think that's actually pretty good
60:00 - uh i don't like that i can't scroll down
60:02 - past this let me just
60:06 - uh instead of margin
60:08 - uh just top i'm gonna replace that
60:12 - with the y-axis so now i can scroll down
60:15 - a little bit past
60:16 - the bottom
60:20 - okay
60:22 - so
60:23 - um
60:25 - let's see what do i want to do these
60:27 - should be a little bit spaced and the x
60:29 - needs to be centered vertically and
60:31 - horizontally
60:32 - which i can do with flexbox
60:36 - and let me space these out just a little
60:38 - bit
60:39 - so
60:39 - on the cards
60:41 - i can do
60:44 - margin
60:45 - of
60:47 - 1.
60:48 - okay
60:50 - all right that looks good
60:52 - and now
60:55 - for the border actually let me do border
60:59 - of
61:01 - oh can i do any color
61:04 - fuchsia
61:06 - does that work no i think it has to be
61:09 - one of those
61:10 - standard colors like
61:12 - warning or something
61:16 - yeah now the border changed
61:19 - okay i'm gonna leave it like that
61:22 - um
61:24 - i think it looks
61:26 - pretty good
61:28 - um oh yeah one more thing is that the
61:30 - border
61:32 - uh that these cards have a border radius
61:35 - but
61:36 - the
61:37 - things that i built do not
61:40 - so let me see
61:41 - what the border radius on these are
61:45 - border
61:49 - um hmm
61:53 - am i on the right one
61:59 - let's see
62:03 - computed
62:07 - yeah it should be here
62:12 - border left border
62:16 - yeah here it is four pixels okay so
62:19 - border top left radius 4 pixels so they
62:22 - just set them individually
62:24 - okay
62:25 - so i want these cards to have
62:28 - 4 pixel radius because it seems like
62:29 - everything else does
62:32 - and i'll put it here too so i think they
62:34 - have a utility class for
62:37 - um
62:38 - border radiuses
62:42 - let's see
62:44 - here we go
62:48 - um
62:52 - rounded okay
62:57 - add border classes
63:00 - so i guess rounded
63:05 - would be
63:11 - i don't i feel like these sizes should
63:12 - be standard and they don't say what the
63:14 - sizes are anywhere
63:16 - let me see what this actually means
63:21 - so
63:24 - if i look
63:27 - at
63:29 - oh that's an svg will that show me
63:32 - oh that's 3.2 pixels
63:34 - and what's this one
63:40 - okay so
63:42 - oh well i mean it's close enough i'll
63:44 - get a little bit of a round so let me do
63:46 - rounded large
63:50 - um
63:51 - okay that's fine
63:53 - rounded large
63:55 - it's close enough to four for me anyway
63:59 - and let me put that class here too oh
64:01 - let me put it next to the other border
64:04 - class
64:08 - all right
64:09 - okay i think that looks good
64:13 - it seems to match up enough anyway
64:16 - um
64:17 - okay so now i have all the buttons let
64:19 - me just do one more styling thing which
64:21 - is move this x
64:23 - to center it here
64:26 - and
64:27 - how do i do that
64:29 - let's see
64:30 - um
64:32 - i already have so many classes here
64:34 - it's just
64:35 - so many classes
64:38 - so i'm just gonna put them inside of
64:41 - here then
64:43 - uh let me put
64:44 - um
64:46 - so
64:47 - display flex oh wait i can't do that
64:49 - down here
64:50 - display
64:52 - flex
64:54 - uh
64:56 - align
64:58 - let me do justify first so justify
65:01 - con
65:02 - content
65:04 - center
65:06 - align
65:08 - can i do a line item center
65:11 - let's see
65:13 - okay cool
65:14 - awesome and now i have
65:16 - everything centered so even if i type
65:18 - text in there
65:20 - like instead of the x i could do
65:23 - um
65:25 - let's say clip oh wait let me put this
65:27 - in the double curly braces so clip dot
65:30 - name
65:31 - i could put the name of the clip in
65:32 - there
65:35 - oh cool i think that's actually better
65:37 - for right now because there's no icon
65:39 - associated with the clip so to have the
65:41 - name of it
65:43 - um
65:44 - you can tell these aren't
65:45 - drums or anything
65:48 - um
65:49 - although i do have a drum set at my
65:50 - house i was thinking about recording
65:52 - myself
65:53 - do it but i'd have to move my whole
65:54 - audio setup into another room to record
65:57 - each sound and i just said okay well i'm
66:00 - just going to use these free mp3 files
66:03 - oh one more thing one more thing i do
66:05 - want to style
66:08 - um
66:09 - so
66:10 - on hover
66:12 - oops hover
66:13 - i do want to style
66:16 - let's see
66:19 - um
66:20 - was it oh the mouse pointer so
66:24 - uh cursor is it pointer cursor cursor
66:27 - pointer i think it's cursor
66:29 - pointer
66:33 - yeah and now i have
66:35 - it looks like it's clickable
66:39 - cool
66:42 - so
66:44 - it's not perfect styling but it's okay i
66:46 - think
66:48 - okay thanks
66:50 - yeah i can't i can't remember i've
66:53 - uh
66:55 - css is is just
66:57 - a memorization language kind of so it's
67:00 - like
67:00 - if you're not in it every day
67:02 - it's like you forget
67:04 - the exact terms you have to use i guess
67:08 - so
67:09 - what do i want to do next so i have
67:14 - i have all the clips
67:16 - um
67:17 - let's try to play sounds
67:19 - right so let's
67:21 - let's make a function
67:23 - a method here
67:25 - so
67:26 - methods
67:28 - oh no i hope you can hear the sounds
67:32 - uh
67:35 - oh wait i think i have system audio
67:37 - muted
67:38 - but maybe i can
67:43 - uh make it so you can hear well let me
67:45 - get the sounds playing first and see if
67:47 - you can hear them
67:48 - so let's see
67:50 - a play clip
67:53 - so this function
67:55 - it's gonna have to take in the name of
67:57 - the sound
67:58 - that url so
68:01 - i'm gonna have to pass in the exact clip
68:06 - and then this is where
68:08 - i'm planning on using the what is it
68:11 - javascript
68:12 - the audio constructor so
68:16 - audio
68:17 - not the html5 audio tag but the
68:20 - uh well this this should come up
68:23 - somewhere
68:30 - new audio yeah
68:32 - this is it
68:36 - um
68:37 - not a lot of details here
68:39 - all right
68:40 - yeah so basically
68:42 - i can create new audio element and play
68:44 - sounds in the browser
68:46 - um
68:51 - that's yeah that's as much as i can say
68:53 - about that
68:54 - i thought it would show like
68:56 - oh yeah here so once you create that
68:59 - audio element you can do dot play
69:02 - and
69:03 - yeah there are other things called like
69:06 - pause
69:07 - dot pause
69:09 - i should really contribute to that
69:11 - documentation
69:13 - um with some examples all right
69:16 - so that's
69:17 - that's what i'm gonna be using and i
69:20 - think
69:21 - that i can pass these in dynamically
69:24 - which i hope is going to work
69:26 - so let's do
69:28 - let's
69:32 - let s equal
69:35 - new
69:36 - audio
69:37 - so use the javascript constructor
69:40 - and then i'll pass in the clip
69:42 - which actually let me call it clip url
69:45 - so there's no confusion about what i'm
69:47 - passing in
69:48 - not the whole object just passing in the
69:50 - url
69:52 - and then
69:53 - s is now this audio object
69:56 - so now i should be able to do s dot play
70:01 - all right
70:02 - so no pause feature or anything yet
70:05 - um but that's okay
70:09 - so
70:10 - i guess to do pause i'd have to put it
70:12 - on data and do some other things i don't
70:14 - know
70:15 - to capture which clip is playing so i
70:17 - could pause it
70:20 - so
70:22 - okay so now when i click on this button
70:25 - i need to have some kind of
70:28 - i guess i'll just put in
70:30 - an act click to capture the click event
70:32 - directly on that div
70:34 - for my square buttons
70:36 - so
70:38 - um
70:38 - at click
70:41 - [Music]
70:42 - is oh yeah the method i just made play
70:46 - clip
70:47 - and then pass in the clip url
70:50 - so
70:52 - let's see pass in
70:55 - the clip dot what did i call that
70:58 - an eclipse
71:00 - oh i called it clip so it's clip.clip
71:03 - i'm gonna change this real quick sorry
71:04 - one second so clip
71:07 - replace it with
71:08 - url
71:10 - okay that is much better
71:14 - now it's just url
71:17 - okay so now i can do clip dot
71:19 - url
71:21 - pass that into play clip
71:23 - and i'm gonna make sure
71:26 - my volume is on yeah
71:29 - yes can you hear that
71:34 - it says that system audio is playing
71:36 - through my stream so
71:50 - i do like the puppy sounds though
71:55 - okay
71:56 - thanks thanks for confirming that
71:59 - um
72:01 - all right so this plays the clip
72:03 - that feels good oh yeah the sound name i
72:05 - need to be capturing which sound is
72:07 - playing
72:08 - so i can update the sound name
72:11 - cool
72:12 - hi bruce how are you
72:16 - um
72:17 - let's see
72:19 - i guess yeah i'll just have
72:22 - like current
72:24 - sound
72:25 - current clip
72:27 - since i'm using the clip terminology
72:29 - uh
72:31 - so let's say
72:34 - empty string at first
72:38 - um and then
72:44 - our latest clip because it's not current
72:47 - clip if it doesn't change after the clip
72:49 - ends
72:51 - so
72:54 - our last played
72:57 - last played i don't know
73:00 - that's fine
73:01 - [Music]
73:02 - um so let me
73:05 - do
73:06 - so i'll do this dot last
73:10 - played
73:12 - equals
73:15 - okay and then in this case i can't just
73:17 - pass in the clip url i'm going to have
73:19 - to pass in
73:21 - the whole clip
73:24 - so i'll have to pass in the name and the
73:26 - url
73:28 - and then here i'll update this to url
73:32 - and then last played will
73:35 - be set to the name
73:39 - okay
73:40 - so now i have to update that here
73:43 - so
73:44 - oops um
73:47 - oh wait wait
73:49 - uh
73:50 - here i'll just pass in the whole clip
73:52 - and then i'm pulling url and name off of
73:54 - that
73:56 - and
73:57 - what's the other thing oh yeah the sound
73:59 - name so
74:01 - i'm gonna have to put
74:03 - last played here
74:08 - oh
74:10 - that kind of stinks because when it's
74:13 - empty it turns into the shriveled thing
74:16 - i'm gonna have to put a default sound
74:20 - [Music]
74:24 - okay yeah i'm gonna have to put some
74:27 - a default there
74:32 - no sound or something
74:34 - so it doesn't
74:37 - just fold
74:38 - um with no text inside
74:44 - okay cool
74:45 - all right so let me hook up the power
74:47 - switch then
74:49 - and see
74:50 - so what should i do for the power switch
74:53 - um
74:54 - i guess i the easiest thing to do would
74:56 - be to put something on data
74:59 - like a boolean on or off and then
75:02 - have an if statement inside play clip
75:05 - um but what i should actually do
75:08 - is make these disabled so you can't
75:10 - click on them
75:12 - or
75:13 - show that they're disabled like gray
75:15 - them out somehow
75:17 - so i could do
75:19 - a class
75:21 - okay let me
75:22 - first let me v model
75:24 - the check box
75:26 - here
75:27 - so
75:28 - put this on two lines
75:30 - so the pat that power switch let me
75:33 - remodel that so i can capture the value
75:37 - equals
75:39 - um
75:40 - power
75:42 - should i do is
75:45 - power no
75:47 - because power can mean different things
75:48 - so
75:50 - is on
75:52 - oh no in javascript i should do
75:56 - a camel case so is on
76:00 - so
76:03 - in data now i'll do is on
76:08 - oh let me start off with true and then
76:09 - you can turn it off if you want
76:13 - okay cool
76:15 - so it's definitely mapping now
76:18 - because it starts off as true
76:21 - and then it goes off all right
76:24 - so now i have to disable these buttons
76:28 - which i'm going to do through an if
76:30 - statement
76:32 - unless someone else has a better idea so
76:35 - and then i can add a class to the
76:37 - buttons to kind of show the user that
76:38 - they're disabled since they're not
76:40 - actual buttons they're divs so
76:42 - i'll just
76:44 - change the class or something
76:48 - oh yeah instead of sound button
76:50 - maybe i'll have disabled button or
76:52 - something i don't know
76:54 - okay so if
76:56 - um
76:58 - this dot is on
77:02 - then
77:04 - i can do all that stuff
77:12 - all right
77:16 - but now it's off it doesn't do anything
77:18 - sweet
77:19 - um but now i don't want these
77:23 - classes
77:24 - so i want to gray them out somehow
77:27 - so i don't know should what should i do
77:29 - an overlay
77:32 - um
77:34 - or something
77:37 - let me make a new class here so let's
77:39 - call this
77:42 - um button disabled
77:49 - and say
77:52 - uh
77:55 - now let's change the border color i
77:57 - guess border now will be gray
78:03 - so
78:06 - okay so now if it's off
78:09 - oh i'm not actually applying the clasp
78:11 - oh man okay so button disabled now i
78:14 - have to
78:15 - conditionally toggle the class
78:18 - so
78:20 - let's see
78:24 - um how do i want to do this
78:30 - so because there's a bunch of classes
78:31 - here so let me see
78:33 - so i can do object syntax or array
78:35 - syntax
78:38 - and if i want to
78:45 - toggle
78:48 - um
78:54 - so i think let me look this up so vue.js
78:58 - dynamic
78:59 - classes
79:08 - and
79:15 - yeah i think if i do object syntax i can
79:18 - put the rest of the classes after the
79:20 - object right and then i don't have to
79:24 - um
79:26 - put them all inside the object so i
79:28 - could just have
79:31 - no i don't think i can do that so i
79:33 - think maybe i need an array here then
79:37 - so maybe i need an object inside of an
79:39 - array
79:41 - uh
79:42 - let's see
79:43 - and then this would be
79:46 - inside of a string
79:49 - and then inside the object it would be
79:52 - um
79:54 - so i'd be checking is
79:57 - is on
79:59 - and then if it is on then i want my
80:02 - class button disabled
80:06 - so
80:06 - i'm going to have to put that in quotes
80:08 - so
80:09 - button
80:10 - disabled
80:15 - so it doesn't like this so i think i
80:17 - need a comma here maybe
80:19 - oh yeah it seems to do okay with that
80:23 - that's good
80:25 - so
80:26 - if is on oh if not is ons meaning if
80:29 - it's not on
80:32 - then the button is disabled okay
80:34 - let me try that
80:38 - doesn't like it
80:41 - okay let me
80:44 - see what's going on with the buttons so
80:47 - okay
80:49 - now
80:52 - okay so it is adding the clasp properly
80:54 - because it's
80:55 - it's changing and now it's adding button
80:57 - disabled to all the buttons
80:59 - but my problem is now in my
81:06 - um
81:08 - css
81:09 - so do i do border color
81:12 - but border
81:17 - let's see
81:19 - now i think because it's putting that
81:21 - class first
81:23 - um
81:24 - that's why
81:28 - so i would have to put this class at the
81:30 - end basically
81:34 - let me
81:35 - do this on two lines
81:37 - um
81:38 - so i would have to put this class at the
81:40 - end so actually i'm gonna
81:43 - get this out
81:46 - and
81:46 - [Music]
81:47 - paste it after
81:50 - oh yeah and then
81:52 - put that back
81:54 - okay
81:55 - so
81:56 - now
81:57 - it should work
82:01 - no it doesn't work
82:03 - it doesn't like that
82:06 - um
82:07 - let's see why isn't changing the border
82:09 - color though
82:12 - so i have button disabled here
82:16 - and
82:18 - it's called button disabled here that's
82:20 - good
82:21 - it might still be putting the class at
82:23 - the beginning
82:27 - okay
82:28 - so
82:30 - border bottom color border left color
82:33 - i mean for this
82:35 - small app i could just do an important
82:37 - statement because it's not overwriting
82:39 - it
82:40 - so i'm wondering if that's what
82:42 - bootstrap has let me look at the rules
82:47 - yeah that's what they're doing they're
82:49 - doing border color importance so to
82:51 - overwrite they're important i'm going to
82:52 - have to use another important statement
82:54 - because
82:55 - that's how important to work
82:57 - everything is more important
82:59 - all right so that's fine whatever
83:04 - it's not
83:07 - okay
83:08 - that's good and now if it's on
83:12 - it goes orange and if it's off it goes
83:18 - yeah that's what i have right now
83:21 - um i don't know maybe you said that a
83:23 - long time ago though about the sound
83:26 - button i don't know how how long the leg
83:28 - is right now
83:29 - hopefully it's not too long but
83:31 - sometimes on youtube it can get a bit
83:33 - long
83:37 - yeah this is the same thing i had maybe
83:39 - it wasn't when you said that comment
83:40 - though
83:43 - oh i guess it's not because it's not is
83:45 - on but yeah the important did it because
83:48 - bootstrap is using important statements
83:51 - but i want to look at i want to make it
83:53 - look like more disabled than it is
83:56 - you know because this looks like it
83:57 - still could be a button oh also the
84:00 - pointer
84:02 - the pointer needs to go away
84:04 - i should do an either or class really
84:07 - um except i want some of these things
84:10 - like
84:12 - actually i want all of these things
84:14 - except the hover
84:16 - so
84:19 - um oh you know what i could do though
84:24 - is
84:26 - border warning
84:28 - what if i put this inside here too
84:31 - so
84:33 - that way i don't need the border gray
84:35 - right
84:38 - let me see let me take out the border
84:40 - gray
84:42 - and see
84:44 - because that way
84:45 - if it's not on
84:49 - oh now it's opposite
84:52 - oh
84:53 - right
84:54 - um
84:55 - okay
84:56 - well never mind because
84:59 - i forgot i'm doing it if it's not on
85:02 - display these classes
85:05 - okay so that was a bad idea
85:07 - let me go back
85:10 - i could do another
85:13 - um
85:16 - so i could
85:19 - i guess i could do a ternary here
85:22 - like is on
85:24 - and i don't know would that be
85:26 - inside a nested
85:29 - like look let me see if i can do a
85:31 - ternary here
85:34 - um
85:36 - and do
85:40 - so here i would have to do
85:43 - i would have to do is on
85:48 - yeah i could do two objects
85:51 - um that would definitely work
85:54 - i'm going to try to do
85:57 - [Music]
85:59 - this so let me get rid of that
86:02 - and then
86:04 - i can do
86:07 - so if it's on
86:09 - oh no no i don't want the button to be
86:11 - disabled
86:12 - let's see i want
86:15 - border
86:17 - warning
86:19 - oh wait and then if it's not on i want
86:22 - the other one i think this is going to
86:23 - work
86:25 - and that way i don't have to do two
86:26 - objects inside i can just check is on
86:28 - once
86:31 - it's not giving me an error so
86:34 - um i think it will work
86:40 - yeah that works
86:41 - cool
86:43 - awesome
86:45 - so
86:49 - let me now change
86:55 - um i don't know should i add an overlay
86:59 - i could add a background
87:01 - just to make it look more disabled like
87:03 - background color
87:05 - of
87:06 - light gray
87:12 - and let me turn it off
87:16 - uh
87:17 - i don't know
87:18 - and then get rid of the
87:22 - um
87:24 - mouse actually you know there's one
87:26 - pointer there's one mouse pointer that
87:28 - has like
87:30 - an x let me look that up because
87:33 - cursor
87:36 - mouse
87:38 - pointers css
87:48 - help wait cross hair cursor cross hair
87:51 - or cursor not allowed
87:54 - um let me see
87:56 - let me see which one
88:00 - which one would look better so now let
88:01 - me go to hover
88:03 - so
88:04 - and
88:06 - hover
88:09 - and then cursor
88:12 - um
88:14 - which which one should i try across here
88:16 - across here
88:21 - oh no that's not what i want i thought
88:24 - this was something different that's not
88:26 - at all
88:27 - that looks like i can
88:29 - drag and select
88:31 - what about not allowed yeah not allowed
88:33 - this one i don't know if you can see it
88:35 - it has the
88:38 - little circle with the line through it
88:40 - in it
88:41 - okay so i'm gonna do not allowed
88:46 - not
88:48 - allowed
88:50 - okay
88:52 - cool now it really looks disabled like
88:55 - you can't do anything
88:56 - and now if i put the power back on
88:58 - you can click on
89:02 - okay uh that all works now
89:05 - so what should i do i guess i should do
89:07 - volume
89:08 - i actually have no idea how to do this i
89:10 - don't think i've ever
89:12 - done volume in the browser
89:15 - let's see
89:18 - um
89:19 - so javascript
89:21 - audio
89:25 - what the audio constructor
89:29 - volume
89:36 - hmm
89:40 - audio context
89:44 - i wonder if it's audio context
89:52 - okay this probably doesn't say anything
89:54 - yeah
89:56 - so that doesn't say anything
90:00 - let me look in audio context real quick
90:04 - interface represents an audio processing
90:06 - graph built from audio
90:09 - uh no i don't think that's what i want
90:14 - create gain create
90:18 - is that what i want
90:21 - uh i really have no idea
90:25 - i could just look straight up like
90:27 - how to
90:30 - set volume in javascript
90:34 - let's see if this is what they're doing
90:38 - okay this person
90:40 - is trying to play and mix multiple
90:42 - sounds play the same sounds interrupt
90:44 - playback
90:48 - let me see if they have volume
90:53 - okay
90:55 - so
90:56 - this was in 2012. the web audio api is
91:00 - now supported
91:04 - although there are a lot of issues no
91:05 - common volume controls let me see the
91:08 - link
91:09 - that it provides
91:11 - oh it goes to the github page
91:15 - okay
91:18 - web audio api editors draft so this is
91:21 - the absolute latest from 2020.
91:24 - um
91:34 - an audio param interface for controlling
91:36 - an individual aspect of an audio node's
91:38 - functioning such as volume
91:41 - i said document dot my
91:45 - audio
91:47 - oh i can change it audio.volume
91:50 - so
91:52 - i could do it here then right so
91:55 - let's see
91:58 - i could do s dot
92:00 - volume
92:02 - equals
92:07 - um
92:08 - 2
92:09 - or 0.2
92:12 - 0.2
92:18 - and close this then
92:19 - all right
92:24 - yeah that does work
92:28 - cool thanks
92:30 - um
92:31 - yeah so i guess
92:34 - yeah let me do it
92:36 - uh to equal this dot range
92:39 - and then i'm gonna have to give it a
92:40 - default here
92:42 - so
92:45 - um
92:46 - let's say
92:47 - actually
92:49 - min max
92:50 - so range has a min max where is range
92:53 - here it is
92:55 - so min 0 max 5
92:58 - and
92:59 - v model of value let me change the value
93:02 - to range
93:04 - or no no let me change it to volume
93:07 - okay
93:08 - so
93:09 - volume
93:12 - and then
93:14 - i'll put it here so this will be
93:18 - volume
93:19 - and let me start it off at two so in the
93:22 - middle
93:25 - and
93:26 - then here it will be
93:28 - volume
93:29 - cool thank you thanks for that
93:38 - nope
93:39 - oh wait i think
93:42 - this
93:43 - does this have to be a zero to one
93:45 - number
93:47 - i think it might have to be let me look
93:49 - at whatever you w3 schools
93:53 - yeah that's what i thought thanks
93:56 - zero to one
93:58 - okay so the leg can't be too bad because
94:01 - that seemed to your comment seemed to
94:02 - come up pretty quick
94:05 - dom audio volume property
94:09 - yeah so this is the same thing dot
94:11 - volume all right
94:14 - let's see
94:16 - so i guess i'll divide it by
94:21 - if it's zero to five man
94:23 - um
94:26 - i can't even think right now so let me
94:28 - divide it by
94:34 - five
94:36 - oh wait
94:37 - right
94:40 - list of volume divided by five and it
94:42 - should be zero to one
94:45 - so
94:49 - by 10
94:58 - oh cool
95:01 - that works that works really well thanks
95:04 - i divided it by five because my max here
95:09 - is five
95:11 - so it's one to five zero is off anyway
95:14 - because you're going to have
95:16 - 0 divided by 5 so it's 0
95:19 - so it won't play any sound
95:23 - okay
95:27 - cool i didn't even know how to do volume
95:28 - before today
95:30 - so that's off this on
95:35 - yeah it's not a huge difference but
95:37 - there's a difference
95:38 - thank you
95:40 - thanks for all your help
95:41 - so is there anything else i should do
95:43 - let's see
95:44 - it's been an hour and 37 minutes
95:47 - so it's like 20 more minutes left
95:50 - um
95:52 - what else could you do with a
95:55 - drum machine i guess get actual drum
95:57 - sounds
95:58 - but
95:59 - this was one thing
96:01 - that i didn't
96:03 - realize because i guess
96:06 - i thought i'd have to use the audio tag
96:08 - but it's cool that i can just pass in
96:11 - a url dynamically to the audio
96:14 - constructor and it just plays
96:16 - that's pretty cool i think this is a
96:18 - nice api
96:20 - um
96:21 - oh what if what if we try to set up the
96:23 - pause i think that's going to be a lot
96:25 - harder
96:26 - so
96:29 - pause i think this should actually be
96:30 - stop
96:33 - stop
96:34 - right not pause because i'm not really
96:36 - pausing i'm stopping
96:39 - so
96:42 - um
96:47 - let's see
96:50 - so i'd need
96:52 - i would need this
96:54 - um instance of audio
96:57 - i think i need this stored on data so
96:59 - that i can run stop on it basically
97:01 - because then i could do this dot
97:06 - current
97:08 - clip
97:10 - no no no
97:12 - um
97:14 - like this dot
97:18 - audio
97:20 - current audi current audio maybe
97:24 - because that's the audio object
97:28 - and then i could do dot stop
97:32 - run dot stop or is it dot pause
97:36 - is it there should be a dot stop right
97:38 - but the only one i know for sure is dot
97:40 - pause
97:42 - so let's let me see if this works so i
97:45 - would do
97:46 - current audio
97:52 - which at first would just be an empty
97:54 - object
97:57 - and
98:00 - um
98:02 - what else
98:04 - so
98:05 - oh yeah so i need to actually
98:07 - do that here so then this would be
98:12 - uh this dot
98:13 - current audio
98:16 - and then i would do
98:21 - yeah basically here
98:24 - oh no i would set this after so
98:27 - let me
98:29 - do
98:31 - uh i don't like using s then
98:33 - i guess i could change it to a
98:36 - and then
98:37 - this dot current
98:40 - audio equals
98:42 - a
98:44 - and then i could stop it here
98:47 - basically
98:48 - oh but if i'm just pausing it's going to
98:50 - pause in the middle of the clip then i
98:52 - need to reset it
98:55 - right
98:56 - reset it back to the beginning of the
98:58 - clip
98:59 - let me just see let me see how this
99:01 - works
99:02 - a is not defined
99:04 - um oh oh right so
99:09 - actually i'm not redefining it here so
99:11 - let me do const
99:14 - okay
99:17 - oh yeah i need a stop button how do i
99:19 - stop
99:20 - um
99:22 - should i just do a pause button in the
99:23 - middle here
99:27 - uh
99:28 - i could change it into a pause button
99:31 - until it's done playing and then change
99:33 - it back into the name
99:35 - i think that would be pretty cool
99:37 - let me add a pause button here just so i
99:39 - can test this out real quick
99:40 - up at the top
99:42 - so in between power and last play let me
99:45 - add
99:48 - b
99:50 - button
99:53 - and
99:58 - i guess the variant
100:01 - is it called variant could be
100:06 - i don't know info
100:08 - so it's
100:10 - a different color
100:11 - and then
100:14 - uh what do i want to say oh yeah pause
100:18 - or stop
100:20 - stop
100:23 - okay stop cool and now i can add an ad
100:26 - click to this so
100:28 - at click
100:30 - click equals
100:34 - um
100:36 - oh yeah stop it's just stop
100:38 - that's my method name
100:41 - so let me try this
100:44 - oh it's not fast enough because all
100:46 - these clips are like
100:48 - one second long
100:50 - it's i think it
100:52 - i think it did stop
100:55 - yeah it did okay
100:57 - so stop works
101:00 - and i it didn't sound like i had to
101:02 - reset it do i have to reset it back to
101:04 - zero
101:08 - let me try to stop the van door
101:11 - yeah it does stop
101:14 - and then it does start over again so i
101:16 - guess pause just started the clip over
101:19 - i don't know if that's the intended
101:21 - behavior but that's what it seems to be
101:23 - doing
101:25 - okay
101:26 - so that seems to work
101:30 - um
101:33 - now my cat's meowing for attention
101:36 - um
101:38 - let me actually because everything else
101:40 - is outlined let me outline that button
101:42 - it looks like a eyesore
101:44 - in the middle of everything
101:46 - or
101:48 - i wonder if i should just put
101:52 - stop no because then i would have to
101:54 - know
101:55 - i would have to time when the clip
101:57 - stopped and then change it back to the
101:59 - name i don't have time for all that
102:01 - because i don't think i have time to
102:03 - figure out how to do that but that would
102:04 - be an interesting thing if i could do
102:06 - that let me just fix the button for
102:08 - right now
102:09 - let me
102:12 - fix oh i can just do outline dash
102:15 - so let me do outline dash then
102:17 - info
102:19 - so
102:20 - outline dash info
102:25 - okay
102:26 - that looks a bit better yeah and this
102:28 - looks clickable this looks like it's not
102:30 - clickable so that's good
102:34 - there should be a resume if you want to
102:36 - resume
102:40 - but i'm not sure if it's saving
102:43 - the current
102:45 - like is it saving the current state so
102:47 - when i stop
102:49 - is it saving that
102:54 - because i guess play starts over at zero
103:00 - thanks
103:01 - way funnier i could actually make music
103:04 - like this
103:05 - [Applause]
103:06 - [Music]
103:07 - [Applause]
103:10 - there should be a repeat like i should
103:12 - be able to toggle these on repeat
103:14 - so you can actually make a song
103:17 - um
103:19 - i wonder how to do that
103:23 - so
103:26 - let's see
103:28 - also right now stop
103:31 - if i'm doing multiple things it just
103:33 - stops the last one not like every single
103:36 - sound
103:38 - what do you mean no
103:42 - no you don't like the random sounds or
103:44 - no it's not
103:45 - music or i don't know what no means
103:49 - or you don't want repeat
103:55 - i guess that's not really a
103:57 - drum machine or yeah drum machine you
104:00 - would have repeat
104:01 - oh don't mix these sounds
104:03 - oh don't
104:04 - don't mix them because if i have repeat
104:07 - then
104:09 - i'll have the horse sound over and over
104:11 - again with poker chips and everything
104:13 - yeah they're not the best sounds to put
104:15 - together
104:17 - um
104:18 - okay
104:25 - well
104:28 - so some ideas were that i could
104:31 - do
104:32 - resume on the sound
104:34 - um
104:35 - but the sound starts over so
104:38 - i i guess also i'm when i play it again
104:41 - i'm setting this to a new
104:43 - current audio
104:46 - so
104:48 - yeah i wonder if if there's a way to
104:51 - know like when a clip finished how would
104:54 - i know when a clip finishes because then
104:56 - i could check to see if a clip finishes
104:58 - and i could actually have a current
105:00 - audio array and
105:03 - i could be watching the array
105:06 - check when a clip finishes
105:08 - and then
105:11 - take it out of the array i think that
105:13 - would be the more advanced way to do
105:15 - this
105:21 - let me actually see
105:22 - i know i'm stuck on the repeat but let
105:24 - me see if there's
105:27 - javascript
105:30 - sound
105:31 - no audio
105:33 - audio
105:35 - repeat
105:40 - oh you can do loop
105:43 - i have to try this
105:44 - i have stop so i'll be able to stop it
105:47 - uh
105:50 - let me do
105:52 - loop here
105:53 - so
105:55 - do i do it instead of play is that what
105:58 - i do
105:59 - let me try
106:02 - a dot
106:03 - loop
106:08 - let me do something
106:11 - not too bad
106:15 - no it doesn't play so i think i need to
106:17 - do
106:18 - before play okay
106:21 - so i think i need to
106:25 - uh
106:27 - okay let's try
106:30 - this here
106:34 - didn't work
106:38 - a dot loop is not a function
106:41 - so
106:45 - oh element.lube is true okay
106:48 - all right so it's a property
106:50 - so let's do dot
106:52 - true and
106:55 - try this
106:57 - okay let me
107:00 - refresh
107:02 - shoot
107:03 - turn it all the way up shoot error
107:08 - cool
107:12 - um so i guess i could have a toggle that
107:14 - says loop or not loop
107:19 - but the problem
107:20 - is okay so what i'm gonna do now is
107:24 - actually stop
107:26 - the currently playing sound if there's a
107:28 - current sound
107:30 - i'm gonna call stop first before i set a
107:33 - new audio and do all this stuff
107:35 - because otherwise i'm not going to be
107:37 - able to stop old sounds right now
107:41 - so
107:41 - i'm going to do that real quick so i'm
107:43 - going to run this dot
107:45 - stop
107:48 - first oh wait that's a method
107:52 - so i'll run this dot stop
107:54 - to make sure all other audio stopped
107:56 - because otherwise multiple things might
107:58 - be looping
108:00 - and then
108:01 - i can have a loop toggle
108:04 - so
108:08 - let me do
108:10 - loop
108:12 - and
108:13 - i'll set that to false
108:16 - and i can do
108:20 - a dot loop here as this dot loop
108:26 - and then i'll have a toggle up at the
108:27 - top
108:29 - and i think this will be the last thing
108:31 - that i can do in the stream
108:34 - so
108:36 - the power
108:37 - so okay
108:38 - um
108:40 - let me put this loop maybe i'll just put
108:43 - it
108:45 - around the
108:47 - in the second row with the volume
108:50 - and let me say loop
108:52 - loop oh
108:55 - loop
108:59 - and
109:02 - let me say loop
109:06 - okay
109:09 - so oh that's kind of messy
109:14 - um
109:16 - something's wrong here
109:18 - this dot current audio dot pause is not
109:20 - a function
109:22 - oh because if
109:25 - if the current audio is stopped already
109:28 - i guess it
109:30 - removes itself or it's no longer a
109:33 - callable method
109:35 - so
109:37 - i'm going to have to say
109:42 - uh
109:44 - hmm what should i do so
109:46 - if
109:47 - this dot
109:49 - no wait if this dot
109:54 - um where is it current
109:57 - current audio
110:02 - wait
110:03 - let me just do a try catch here
110:05 - that's probably the quickest thing to
110:08 - do try and then
110:12 - catch
110:17 - so
110:18 - i'll just log out the error
110:21 - not as an error
110:24 - but just says that oh yeah i need to
110:25 - close the catch all right
110:30 - so
110:37 - yeah i'm logged out here okay that's
110:39 - looping properly so let me stop
110:42 - didn't throw an error because it was
110:44 - still playing that time
110:45 - so
110:47 - let me turn loop off
110:52 - so looping does work this is messy let
110:54 - me fix the mess
110:56 - in the top real quick
110:57 - um
110:59 - i wonder if that should be
111:02 - below
111:03 - like i could do another b row maybe
111:06 - if there are more options
111:09 - and then i can
111:11 - add oops
111:12 - i can add looping there
111:15 - of course in these other b rows there
111:18 - are
111:23 - more styling options so maybe i want to
111:26 - add those too
111:28 - hey i didn't get the space in there
111:31 - okay
111:33 - okay that's better
111:36 - it's not
111:37 - really good looking but at least it's
111:39 - not on top of each other
111:49 - okay cool
111:53 - um yeah so i guess that's it for the
111:56 - drum machine let me push my code what i
111:58 - have from today
112:00 - so
112:01 - let me
112:02 - i'm inside the drum app right now let me
112:05 - just see the up one directory
112:07 - in case i've changes from there
112:10 - and let's see get status
112:13 - oh yeah because i moved clips.js so good
112:16 - i'll catch all those changes too so let
112:18 - me do
112:20 - git
112:21 - add
112:22 - um wait let me
112:25 - make sure i did my get ignore properly
112:27 - first
112:31 - so i have a git ignore yeah i just
112:33 - wanted to make sure i had added my git
112:35 - ignore first okay so that should handle
112:37 - all that so i can do get status
112:41 - that will add the view app and the drum
112:43 - machine so do git
112:45 - add just add everything
112:47 - git commit
112:49 - dash m
112:51 - uh code oh drum machine code
112:56 - from
112:58 - live stream
113:01 - on july 3rd
113:05 - cool
113:06 - which is a holiday weekend here in the
113:09 - us
113:13 - thank you sashi it was nice having you
113:15 - thanks for all the help
113:17 - so let me refresh
113:19 - this here
113:21 - cool
113:22 - i think it was more fun after i got the
113:25 - styling worked out at the first 20 30
113:28 - minutes
113:29 - but yeah i'm gonna try to figure out why
113:31 - incline wouldn't work
113:33 - after the stream
113:35 - all right so here's all of the app um
113:40 - the drum machine so markdown previewer
113:42 - and quote machine
113:44 - let's see
113:47 - and then next week so next friday i'll
113:49 - be doing the next app which i actually
113:52 - don't know what it is yet
113:54 - so let's see
113:57 - here's the drum machine oh if i go into
113:59 - learn
114:00 - i can see all the front end projects
114:03 - front and libraries
114:05 - yeah
114:06 - so
114:07 - drum machine oh okay calculator oh i
114:10 - actually built a calculator too uh
114:13 - five years ago
114:15 - i built the calculator actually for this
114:17 - project so i'm going to have to find my
114:18 - old code i definitely did it in react
114:22 - and i think i've done one in jquery too
114:25 - so
114:25 - yeah we'll see i'll probably be
114:28 - shocked at what my code looked like back
114:30 - then
114:32 - all right yeah uh
114:34 - javascript calculator and then a
114:36 - pomodoro clock i remember my pomodoro
114:39 - clock that was like
114:40 - it looks kind of like a time machine
114:42 - really weird ufo style
114:45 - so those two are coming in the future
114:47 - and then after that i want to build kind
114:49 - of a bigger project
114:51 - more of the style that i do on my
114:53 - regular channel
114:55 - yeah thanks tech stats thanks for
