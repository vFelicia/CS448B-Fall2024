00:06 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:07 - with jesse
00:09 - and today we're going to work with git
00:12 - and github
00:13 - and we will merge some pull requests in
00:16 - particular we have two pull requests
00:19 - that i'd like to merge in our bulletin
00:23 - project that we're doing with react
00:26 - and if we get through that and we have a
00:28 - little bit more time
00:31 - then i have a pull request for a bug
00:33 - that i had found
00:35 - in the
00:38 - in the resource center project
00:42 - so let's get started
00:47 - all right
00:48 - let's see
00:49 - so let me get my
00:53 - my screens in order
00:58 - okay
00:59 - and i want to apologize um i had
01:01 - mentioned on monday that i would be
01:03 - streaming wednesday
01:06 - obviously i did not stream on wednesday
01:08 - so i had completely forgotten
01:11 - that i had the day off wednesday so
01:13 - everybody at
01:15 - the university that i worked at had the
01:18 - day off uh so it was um all saints day
01:22 - which is a catholic uh holiday and this
01:25 - is a catholic university so we have the
01:27 - day off
01:29 - um so
01:30 - uh for anyone who celebrates all saints
01:32 - day
01:33 - or today which is all souls day
01:39 - then
01:40 - i hope you were able to make it to mass
01:43 - yesterday and uh
01:47 - today i am listening to some traditional
01:50 - music for all souls day so
01:53 - if anybody happens to like classical
01:55 - music based on
01:58 - early medieval uh poetry then let me
02:02 - know i can send you some nice spotify
02:04 - playlists
02:06 - um
02:08 - okay
02:10 - so hey everybody i see some of you are
02:13 - saying hi there in the live chat okay
02:15 - great
02:16 - i uh i just got the
02:19 - the analytics was showing zero viewers
02:21 - for a while there and now it finally
02:23 - kicked in so
02:25 - um
02:26 - i think we're good to start so we're
02:29 - going to go through both these pull
02:31 - requests and first thing we'll do is
02:32 - we'll we'll pull them in on a separate
02:34 - branch test them
02:36 - make sure everything's okay we'll and
02:39 - then we'll merge them in if we happen to
02:40 - have any merge conflicts we'll work out
02:42 - those merge conflicts um
02:45 - you know live
02:46 - and hopefully if you're not that
02:48 - familiar with git then
02:51 - this will this will help you out
02:53 - for me at least when i started working
02:55 - with git just the basic commits
02:58 - were not that hard
03:00 - but
03:01 - it made me a little bit nervous when i i
03:03 - first started getting into
03:06 - merging pull requests
03:07 - dealing with merge conflicts
03:10 - that was
03:11 - that was kind of like
03:12 - another level for me so
03:15 - hopefully this will let you you know get
03:17 - an idea of what it's what it's like for
03:20 - a real project you know to bring in code
03:22 - from other people and and how to handle
03:25 - that uh without you actually having to
03:27 - go through this on your own projects you
03:30 - know and
03:31 - uh
03:32 - try to learn it and and make mistakes on
03:34 - your own
03:35 - uh hopefully i make the mistakes and you
03:38 - can you can see it and then you don't
03:39 - have to
03:41 - uh i don't think we'll make any mistakes
03:43 - though uh these seem pretty
03:44 - straightforward in terms of a
03:47 - pool uh pull requests go
03:50 - so let me start my pomodoro timer if you
03:52 - haven't watched the stream before first
03:55 - of all welcome thanks for watching and
03:57 - then secondly uh i like to break things
04:00 - up between
04:01 - 25 minute periods of coding or in this
04:04 - case
04:04 - reviewing code and then five minutes of
04:07 - question answer and then we just go back
04:09 - and forth between the 25 minute five
04:11 - minute periods
04:12 - and then at the end if there are any
04:14 - other questions left in the live chat i
04:16 - will answer them all so
04:18 - if you have a question go ahead and put
04:20 - it in the live chat now and then please
04:22 - be patient and i will get to it
04:24 - uh
04:25 - at one during one of those break times
04:27 - or at the end of the stream
04:29 - uh probably gonna only do two
04:32 - sessions of coding
04:34 - today
04:35 - i got the stream started a little bit
04:37 - later than normal just had my my whole
04:39 - day almost was filled up with meetings
04:41 - so
04:43 - it just took me a while to get
04:44 - everything
04:45 - get everything ready and get the stream
04:47 - scheduled
04:49 - uh let's see
04:53 - we're gonna check out if you'd like to
04:55 - check out the repository so that you can
04:57 - see the code too in github it's the
04:59 - bulletin react repository the link is in
05:02 - the description for the video
05:05 - if it's not in the description let me
05:07 - know it should be
05:10 - and i think we'll start with
05:13 - the pull request
05:15 - let's go should we do 57.58 let's start
05:18 - with pull request 57
05:21 - and this is from
05:22 - sebastian
05:25 - so
05:27 - we're going to do a get fetch
05:30 - origin
05:32 - pool and we're going to pull request 57
05:34 - since we'll put our 57
05:37 - get the head and we'll call this since
05:39 - sebastian submitting the pull request
05:41 - i'm just gonna put an s there and then
05:47 - let's see
05:48 - uh
05:54 - uh there's there's several different
05:56 - things here i like to name my um my
05:59 - branches for testing based on what's
06:01 - happening in the pull request but this
06:03 - there's several things here
06:11 - all right let's just say styling
06:14 - just in general because a few of the
06:16 - commits are about styling
06:19 - there we go so now we can do a get
06:22 - checkout
06:24 - and onto that branch that we just made
06:28 - okay when i switch it when i pull in a
06:30 - branch to test and i switch to it i
06:32 - always do a yarn or we could do an npm
06:35 - install for not doing yarn
06:37 - in this case we had nothing to update
06:39 - but just in case the pull request
06:42 - added another npm package we want to
06:45 - make sure we get that right away or else
06:47 - we may end up getting some errors
06:50 - and uh we might waste time trying to
06:52 - troubleshoot that when all we needed to
06:53 - do was just
06:55 - update
06:56 - all right so i'm gonna go to our
06:57 - bulletin
07:00 - and
07:01 - we'll check it out specifically let's
07:04 - check out our print view because this
07:05 - pull request happens to uh deal a bit
07:08 - with print view
07:10 - okay not that so one of the things that
07:12 - i had wanted
07:14 - um was a close button
07:18 - so
07:20 - i like that probably um what i'll do or
07:23 - if any of you would like to do it
07:25 - is uh maybe move that close button over
07:28 - to this side
07:30 - upper right side it's entirely possible
07:33 - that when i open an issue about this i
07:36 - said left side accidentally
07:39 - instead of right side
07:41 - so if i did i apologize but i
07:44 - think
07:45 - i would like it better on this side and
07:47 - then that way we could move uh
07:49 - our content up a little bit higher
07:52 - otherwise uh this is good
07:57 - and let's
07:59 - fix the attachment code print view
08:02 - button bug
08:04 - let's see
08:11 - great
08:13 - white space and print document
08:16 - okay
08:17 - uh wonderful i think
08:20 - i think that's all we'll really need to
08:22 - test out if you notice i do have the
08:25 - console open
08:26 - so that i see any errors
08:29 - the only error we're getting is
08:32 - uh from an an image
08:35 - that we're trying to pull in so i'm not
08:37 - worried about that that may just be
08:40 - uh
08:41 - something
08:42 - having to do with either us being a
08:44 - local host or maybe some problem uh in
08:48 - our wordpress installation where that
08:50 - image
08:51 - perhaps it doesn't exist so in any case
08:54 - this is okay i'm not worried about this
08:57 - error it doesn't look like we're getting
08:58 - any more errors
09:00 - i could click around just to be sure
09:05 - um
09:06 - great all right so now
09:08 - the next step is let's merge this so the
09:12 - first merge i'm going to make
09:15 - i'm going to merge the master branch
09:17 - into this test branch
09:20 - i know i've mentioned this before but
09:22 - for any of you who maybe haven't heard
09:24 - it before i like to merge the master
09:26 - into the test branch first that way if
09:28 - it really messes things up we haven't
09:30 - messed up our master branch we've just
09:32 - messed up the test branch but if
09:34 - everything's all right there we can do a
09:36 - checkout to our master branch that means
09:38 - we're just moving uh to the master
09:40 - branch
09:43 - and if you're not familiar at all with
09:45 - git when i say we move to the master
09:47 - branch that means
09:49 - the version of the code that we have
09:51 - saved as our master branch now all our
09:54 - code will switch
09:55 - to be that version
09:58 - so if we if we had our code let's say
10:01 - open in the background here we could
10:03 - potentially actually see the change
10:05 - happen
10:07 - uh whoops i meant to say get check out
10:10 - master
10:12 - now we can do a git merge
10:14 - and we'll merge that test branch in
10:19 - into master and now we get a little
10:22 - summary of what's happened we've changed
10:24 - the these following files
10:26 - and it gives us
10:28 - the the pluses are additions to those
10:30 - files the red minuses are
10:34 - deletions from those files
10:36 - so
10:37 - there we go so now we've officially
10:39 - updated it the final step
10:41 - is to push that code back up
10:44 - to
10:45 - github which is where we're storing our
10:47 - repository you don't have to use github
10:50 - if you're using get
10:52 - it's it's helpful but it's not um it's
10:55 - not necessary
10:58 - so we're gonna do a get push
11:01 - origin master
11:06 - there we go so now
11:08 - the code that we've just merged in
11:11 - is available in our master branch on
11:14 - github
11:15 - and if you're following along with the
11:17 - repo pull request 57 should now say
11:20 - merged
11:22 - it may auto update for you or you may
11:24 - have to refresh
11:30 - but when you do it like this on the
11:32 - command line you push it up you don't
11:33 - have to hit the merge button on github
11:37 - in your browser it will automatically
11:39 - say that it's merged
11:45 - all right
11:47 - so
11:48 - the next pull request that i'd like to
11:50 - work on
11:52 - is
11:54 - pull request 58
11:57 - okay so harshit has uh submitted this
12:00 - pull request and it's it's titled uh
12:02 - miscellaneous changes but it also closes
12:06 - issue
12:07 - 59. so issue 59 was opened up by
12:12 - let me double check this but
12:14 - um since i've read it
12:17 - i think i read it yesterday
12:19 - um it was upgrade material ui
12:22 - um and this was submitted by i believe
12:26 - christian
12:27 - yes so christian submitted this and uh
12:30 - letting us know that material ui has
12:32 - come out with a new version
12:34 - uh and so we should upgrade to that so
12:36 - harsha's has upgraded to that and also
12:39 - removed the read more buttons
12:42 - because now on our posts if
12:45 - there is more to read we have a continue
12:48 - reading this will be nice because on
12:50 - posts like this which are really small
12:52 - there's not really anything else to see
12:55 - so it would be
12:56 - there there wouldn't necessarily be any
12:58 - advantage
12:59 - to clicking read more uh if you really
13:02 - wanted to see the single page with just
13:05 - this post you could always click on the
13:06 - title instead
13:08 - okay
13:10 - but
13:14 - this will save some space overall
13:18 - let's see
13:22 - wonderful i just wanted to test that out
13:24 - and make sure that we uh because i
13:25 - hadn't tested this out for the print
13:27 - view so we can in fact do print view
13:30 - with um
13:32 - a single post great
13:34 - uh all right so we're going to go
13:37 - through the same process as we did
13:38 - before
13:40 - it doesn't look like we'll have merge
13:42 - conflicts
13:43 - but let me check yeah so
13:46 - get let me pull this over just so you
13:48 - can see what git does so
13:50 - i'm on
13:52 - i'm viewing that pull request and here
13:57 - it'll let us know it'll scan the
13:59 - branches and let us know if there will
14:01 - be merge conflicts so
14:04 - we should be okay i'm still going to go
14:06 - through the same process as i did it's
14:08 - just a good practice
14:11 - to test things out
14:14 - first uh so just because there's not
14:17 - going to be any conflicts merge
14:18 - conflicts doesn't mean that we should
14:20 - automatically pull it in right because
14:22 - it may have no conflicts but
14:25 - um
14:27 - we
14:28 - we may not like what what has happened
14:31 - uh so
14:32 - there could be no conflicts in the code
14:34 - but there might be errors when you try
14:35 - to run it
14:38 - um
14:40 - let's see
14:50 - okay i happen to look over to live chat
14:52 - and arvin says get push origin is always
14:55 - the same as get push origin master
14:57 - that's good to know i can save save some
15:00 - time now and and typing that so let's if
15:02 - i remember hopefully i'll remember in
15:04 - about a few minutes when we go to push
15:06 - this up we'll try to type it in uh the
15:09 - shortened way
15:13 - okay and looks like sebastian found
15:16 - maybe a little bug
15:18 - when switching back to normal view it
15:20 - will always be on grid view
15:26 - um
15:30 - let's see so if we go to print and then
15:33 - click here oh yeah it always goes to
15:35 - grid okay
15:37 - um sebastian if you'd like to open an
15:40 - issue about that then please feel free
15:43 - otherwise maybe i'll open an issue a
15:45 - little bit later on if you didn't catch
15:46 - that here's what happens
15:48 - we can choose list view
15:51 - and then we choose print view and when
15:52 - we go back out what we what should
15:54 - happen is that we should still be in
15:56 - list view but what really happens is
15:57 - that we've gone back to grid view
16:00 - so
16:02 - we'll want to
16:05 - we'll want to change that
16:08 - and
16:13 - so that was that was a good catch on
16:14 - that sebastian i had not noticed that
16:18 - let's see
16:22 - here we go
16:23 - all right so let's go with uh get fetch
16:28 - origin pool this is pull request
16:32 - 58
16:34 - head and
16:36 - this is from harshit and
16:40 - let's say
16:44 - material ui
16:46 - uh since this this pull request among
16:49 - other things did upgrade to the new
16:51 - version of material ui
16:54 - great now we're going to check out oops
16:56 - git checkout
16:59 - this
17:03 - and we're going to run yarn
17:05 - and this time
17:07 - we do actually have an update for our
17:09 - package
17:13 - so we should have updated um
17:18 - material ui
17:20 - and material ui icons to the latest
17:23 - versions
17:24 - okay
17:26 - um
17:29 - let's see
17:35 - now let's merge
17:38 - merge the master
17:41 - oh
17:43 - and
17:44 - do we have a conflict now
17:47 - no it's just prompting us for a merge
17:49 - message
17:51 - okay
17:53 - um
17:55 - all right so let's just
17:58 - merge it
18:03 - there we go
18:08 - and that's just brought in basically
18:09 - it's just brought in all those changes
18:13 - that we had just merged into master it's
18:15 - brought those in
18:17 - to uh to update this branch so there
18:19 - were no conflicts but
18:22 - we needed to update this so if this
18:24 - looks familiar it's because we just saw
18:26 - the same thing up here
18:31 - right here
18:34 - okay now
18:35 - let's give it a little test so
18:38 - we we really shouldn't see anything let
18:40 - me refresh this and let's see if we're
18:41 - getting the same error we are so let's
18:43 - check out this it's not
18:46 - it's saying it's a warning so obviously
18:48 - things are still working here um line
18:51 - items prop on a dom element if you
18:53 - intentionally want it to appear in the
18:54 - dom with a custom attribute spelled
18:56 - lowercase line items instead
19:00 - okay so it looks like
19:02 - uh we have some some props so
19:05 - since we weren't getting this before and
19:07 - we are getting it now
19:09 - potentially
19:11 - maybe something changed in
19:14 - material ui since we updated it and and
19:18 - this is no longer a valid prop
19:21 - so
19:23 - since this is only a warning
19:26 - i'm okay with merging this in now at
19:29 - some point we'll want to fix that
19:31 - but it looks like uh
19:34 - they've created by grid component so it
19:36 - looks like this is having to deal with a
19:37 - grid
19:38 - and the grid seems to be working
19:41 - so we can double check that
19:44 - and
19:46 - potentially if we even are we we may
19:49 - have stopped using the grid for this i
19:50 - think we did switch to
19:53 - using masonry
19:55 - so
19:58 - we should be okay everything looks fine
20:00 - and then we should also
20:03 - there we go so you can see we no longer
20:05 - have that read more
20:08 - okay
20:09 - uh so now that we don't have the read
20:10 - more i may end up
20:13 - cutting out some of the padding here it
20:15 - just seems like more padding that we
20:17 - need
20:18 - but otherwise
20:20 - not bad
20:23 - and then eventually what we will do is
20:26 - uh once we're actually pulling in data
20:28 - about with attachments
20:30 - uh
20:31 - these posts that don't have attachments
20:33 - this entire bottom portion will be gone
20:37 - so
20:38 - it'll save even more space and then only
20:41 - some of the posts will actually have
20:43 - attachments
20:46 - okay
20:47 - looks good though looks good
20:50 - let me just click around just a bit more
20:53 - make sure we're not getting any other
20:54 - errors
20:56 - and
21:00 - let's try this search
21:05 - great
21:06 - okay
21:08 - awesome
21:09 - okay everything seems to be working
21:12 - although that's
21:13 - that's odd
21:15 - to have a space there
21:17 - interesting oh there we go
21:20 - that's really odd huh that was
21:23 - interesting
21:24 - um we'll have to keep an eye out for
21:25 - that
21:26 - uh
21:28 - some empty spaces not a huge issue but
21:32 - just a little kind of visual glitch i
21:34 - guess
21:35 - okay
21:36 - that looks good whoops
21:40 - so let's check how much time okay great
21:42 - seven minutes uh let's go ahead and
21:45 - switch back to the master branch and
21:47 - then merge this in
21:54 - um
21:55 - i just checked in the live chat proxy
21:57 - says how much longer will this go on i
21:59 - just tuned in
22:00 - um
22:01 - i'm thinking another half hour at least
22:04 - um
22:06 - we seem to be going through things
22:07 - pretty quickly so
22:09 - uh more quickly than i anticipated um
22:13 - but i think we have at least another
22:14 - half an hour depending on how many
22:16 - questions uh are in the live chat
22:19 - okay
22:20 - so let's do get checkout
22:23 - master
22:24 - and now
22:25 - let's merge that branch into master
22:27 - which should work
22:29 - with no problems
22:33 - git merge h
22:36 - great
22:41 - all right and now we can do a get
22:44 - push
22:45 - origin
22:49 - okay which i've just learned is a
22:52 - shortened form of saying get push origin
22:54 - master
22:56 - if we wanted to push a different branch
23:00 - we could specify that
23:03 - but if we just want to push master i
23:06 - guess that's the default
23:09 - um
23:12 - great
23:14 - and actually let me ask so arvind is the
23:16 - one that that
23:18 - let us know about get push origin
23:21 - is it relative to the branch you're on
23:23 - so for instance if i was on let's say
23:26 - the dev branch and i did get push origin
23:29 - would it automatically just push
23:31 - um
23:34 - whatever that branch is so would it push
23:36 - to dev or is it automatically master
23:40 - um
23:42 - i'm not sure i guess i can try it out at
23:44 - some point uh if you don't know
23:48 - um okay but
23:52 - at this point
23:55 - all the code now is on github it's all
23:58 - up to date on the master branch and now
24:01 - github says that branch 58 is in fact
24:04 - merged
24:11 - and
24:14 - great so we have
24:15 - all the outstanding pull requests should
24:18 - be merged in for this bulletin react
24:21 - repository not only that but we have our
24:25 - our issues here that have been closed so
24:29 - um let's check this out
24:36 - uh let's check out
24:40 - add a close icon to print view
24:43 - and i do want to see if i
24:46 - in the upper right corner of the preview
24:48 - okay i okay so i didn't mess that up i
24:50 - did i thought i may have messed it up
24:52 - and said left corner
24:54 - okay
24:55 - um
24:56 - let's see this
25:03 - maybe
25:05 - maybe i'll leave this open uh and then
25:09 - i'll close it whenever i put that in the
25:11 - right corner or if any of you want to
25:13 - put that icon in the right corner
25:15 - but it looks like
25:17 - 51.52 let's check out pull requests
25:20 - or i'm sorry issue 52.
25:28 - there we go so this vertically align
25:31 - that attachment icon so
25:33 - before this icon and the text were kind
25:36 - of off in the alignment
25:40 - so let's close that
25:44 - close that issue
25:45 - awesome
25:48 - and
25:50 - let's also see this upgrade
25:52 - uh this was closed
25:55 - so
25:56 - christian
25:57 - uh actually it was already closed
26:00 - this was closed i suppose automatically
26:03 - then
26:04 - um
26:04 - so we've gotten rid of those issues and
26:06 - let's double check
26:10 - okay
26:11 - we can go into our projects now so we're
26:13 - using this uh kind of kanban style
26:17 - uh to track some things and now we can
26:21 - move this over to completed okay
26:25 - and it looks like i'll need to add some
26:26 - more in here we're getting kind of low
26:28 - on to do so
26:31 - i'll have to go through and check that
26:33 - out see what else needs done
26:35 - okay great
26:38 - so about two minutes let me
26:42 - i want to take a look at the live chat
26:43 - now before we start on um on the next
26:47 - pull request we do have a pull request
26:48 - for a previous project and we're gonna
26:51 - we're gonna bring that in
26:52 - um
26:53 - and that one's a little bit more uh
26:56 - technical i guess and because it deals
26:59 - with um
27:01 - with forms and bugs with older browsers
27:03 - and things so
27:05 - uh i don't want to try to explain that
27:07 - with two minutes left so let me go ahead
27:08 - and take the break now
27:10 - and i'll go to the live chat
27:12 - and after this five minutes is up uh
27:15 - we'll do some more
27:16 - um
27:17 - some more merging of pull requests
27:23 - uh let's see
27:25 - jessem says how long have you been with
27:27 - git
27:28 - um
27:30 - i guess so i guess that was how long
27:33 - have i been using it
27:38 - for
27:41 - three or four years
27:44 - yeah somewhere around there
27:48 - uh
28:08 - music says how to get started with
28:09 - github
28:11 - um
28:12 - well check out
28:14 - there there are a couple of courses that
28:16 - are free online that can help you learn
28:19 - about using git and github
28:21 - i recommend
28:23 - if you want more of a structured course
28:25 - i definitely recommend udacity's intro
28:27 - to git and github
28:29 - really
28:30 - i i think the course is very well done
28:34 - so
28:35 - check that out it's a mix of
28:38 - text video
28:40 - hands-on
28:41 - assignments
28:43 - i i really benefited a lot when i took
28:45 - that course early on when i was just
28:47 - learning
28:49 - also if you like videos uh this channel
28:52 - free code cams youtube channel has a
28:54 - series of videos on on git and
28:59 - i believe that
29:02 - code academy has something on git now
29:05 - i'm not positive and then there are also
29:07 - youtube channels that have
29:10 - some get tutorials i think learn code
29:14 - academy
29:15 - does have some get videos
29:17 - uh so you can check that out as well so
29:19 - that would be
29:20 - this would be my suggestions github
29:22 - itself has um tutorials documentation
29:25 - and things like that you could read
29:27 - through if you prefer you know just read
29:29 - through and try things out on your own
29:40 - see uh see
29:42 - s what time is it over there
29:44 - in my time zone um it is
29:48 - 3 30 p.m
29:53 - proxy asks have you ever done merging
29:56 - resolving merge conflicts using github
29:58 - desktop instead of a command line
30:01 - i've actually never used github desktop
30:04 - so
30:07 - i really can't i i can't say anything
30:10 - about it so the answer is no i've never
30:11 - done it um
30:13 - for me the uh the command line seems to
30:16 - be
30:18 - pretty quick
30:19 - uh i can get things done quickly i never
30:21 - have to leave the command line
30:24 - although when dealing with complex merge
30:26 - conflicts
30:27 - i could see how maybe it might be
30:29 - helpful to use something like github
30:30 - desktop i i've never tried it though
30:34 - has anybody used github desktop
30:36 - um at all or and particularly when it
30:39 - comes to merge conflicts
30:42 - uh if you have let me know i'd love to
30:44 - um
30:45 - i'd love to hear about it
30:49 - sebastian says uh missed the right
30:50 - corner part yeah no worries sebastian
30:53 - it's cool
30:54 - um
30:56 - yeah that's not really a big deal that's
30:58 - easy
30:59 - easy fix
31:03 - oh man arvin said i left my job by the
31:05 - way
31:06 - oh arvin what's um
31:10 - uh
31:12 - so how did that go are you are you um
31:15 - i don't know if i should be sorry to
31:16 - hear that you left your job or excited i
31:18 - guess it depends on
31:20 - whether or not you like that job and and
31:22 - what you're uh what you're doing now so
31:25 - um
31:27 - was are you happy about uh about leaving
31:29 - was it a bad situation uh and do you
31:32 - have anything lined up now um in terms
31:35 - of uh in terms of a job
31:39 - anyway let me know and actually for
31:41 - anybody who's looking for work
31:44 - uh occasionally i do have or i hear
31:47 - about some projects that are open for
31:49 - freelancers
31:50 - so let me know if you're interested and
31:53 - then if i find something that fits your
31:55 - skill set i could always you know let
31:57 - you know about it
31:58 - i can't guarantee anything i just i'm
32:01 - not actively looking for work but
32:02 - occasionally people get in touch with me
32:05 - about you know some job so
32:07 - let me know
32:09 - uh also if you tweet and um you tagged
32:14 - me in the tweet saying that hey here's
32:17 - here's what i do you know let's say i
32:19 - i'm a rack developer or i do php or
32:22 - whatever
32:24 - and i'm looking for work
32:25 - i can retweet that for you i don't have
32:28 - a ton of followers i think i have maybe
32:30 - like
32:31 - 600 or something 700 i don't know
32:34 - somewhere around there
32:35 - um but potentially i could retweet you
32:37 - and you know some other people retweet
32:39 - you could reach a large audience so
32:41 - pretty much everybody that follows me is
32:44 - a developer of some sort
32:46 - so
32:47 - i'd be happy to help you out in that way
32:50 - because i know some of you are are
32:52 - looking for work so
32:54 - just let me know all right my five
32:56 - minute timer is up but i'm nearly to the
32:58 - bottom of the live chat so i think i'll
32:59 - do one more question
33:01 - oh arvin says the net ninja has a great
33:04 - tutorial for git and github so i haven't
33:06 - i haven't used that tutorial yet but
33:08 - arvin says it's good so check that out
33:10 - as well that's the net ninja
33:13 - um
33:16 - oh igor did ask about my github black
33:18 - theme yeah it's actually uh it's a
33:20 - script so i use this tamper monkey
33:23 - plug-in
33:24 - um and that's that's a chrome plug-in uh
33:27 - so you load tamper monkey and then
33:29 - search for github dark which uh rook has
33:33 - has pasted in a link to that it is
33:35 - github dark so that that is the correct
33:36 - link rook thank you for that
33:38 - um
33:39 - and then just follow the instructions on
33:41 - that repository and you'll be able to
33:43 - get the um the github dark theme and it
33:46 - also comes with some cool options so
33:49 - um
33:52 - see we have settings here you can change
33:54 - it up
33:55 - uh i actually recently changed up my
33:57 - github theme to this
33:59 - monica space gray 80 so
34:02 - uh
34:03 - you know you could do oh you can change
34:06 - tab size
34:07 - nice
34:08 - i'm definitely setting it to two because
34:10 - that's that's what i like
34:12 - um anyway
34:15 - uh great
34:18 - that's cool all right so
34:22 - um
34:24 - cfas if i stream after work
34:27 - i usually don't stream after work
34:29 - because then i'm i'm home and my uh my
34:32 - network is not good enough at home uh my
34:35 - internet is not good enough to stream in
34:38 - 1080p
34:39 - i don't like to stream at a lower
34:41 - quality because
34:42 - it makes it hard to read the code
34:45 - so
34:47 - usually i i can't even get 720 uh most
34:50 - of the time too so until
34:52 - better internet becomes available where
34:54 - i live
34:55 - i probably won't be streaming from home
34:58 - i'd love to be able to but
35:00 - just doesn't it's not working out right
35:03 - now
35:07 - let's see okay now i'm gonna go back uh
35:10 - and we're gonna merge in another pull
35:11 - request after that i'll go back to the
35:13 - live chat and uh and answer some more
35:16 - questions
35:19 - let's see oops and i just realized that
35:22 - i have my phone plugged in and when i
35:24 - have my phone plugged in uh there's some
35:26 - feedback often on the mic so so
35:30 - sorry if anybody heard some weird
35:32 - feedback going on there
35:35 - but it should be fine now
35:38 - all right so let's go
35:42 - first of all let's bring up
35:44 - this other project
35:47 - which i think i'm running on localhost
35:49 - 3001
35:52 - let's see it's one of these there we go
35:55 - so i already have it up here and here's
35:57 - the problem
36:00 - so the problem that we had which i think
36:02 - i mentioned last week is
36:05 - when you went to submit a form so let's
36:07 - just bring up one of these forms this is
36:09 - we have two forms one is a little bit
36:10 - more complicated this one is the the
36:13 - simpler of the two
36:14 - so you go to fill out the form and you
36:17 - hit submit and nothing happens
36:19 - this bug was found on safari 9.1
36:23 - on a mac
36:25 - so
36:26 - unfortunately
36:28 - the bug was found by the head of my
36:30 - department which is no good right i
36:32 - don't want she was very um
36:36 - very nice about it she wasn't mad at all
36:38 - in fact she had thought that she was
36:39 - doing something wrong so but it's
36:41 - entirely not her fault uh it just it
36:44 - doesn't work so i had mentioned that i
36:47 - thought
36:48 - that it had something to do with our use
36:50 - of async await
36:53 - and it seems like that's the case that
36:55 - that was the problem so
36:57 - um
36:59 - let's uh
37:03 - let's pull in
37:05 - the fix so let's go to
37:09 - let's see let's get our notifications
37:12 - and
37:13 - yeah this was the issue
37:15 - and let's find the pull request
37:21 - all right so
37:22 - what's this holder let me let me give
37:24 - credit here so let me open up
37:26 - um
37:27 - so uh helder
37:30 - has submitted this pull request so thank
37:32 - you very much for this and
37:35 - you'll see in the files that have
37:36 - changed i know it's really small so let
37:38 - me zoom in a bit
37:39 - some of these basically most of these
37:41 - changes are because of formatting which
37:44 - is weird
37:45 - uh because we should have auto
37:47 - formatting happening but anyway so let
37:49 - me scroll to
37:51 - the actual um file that that did change
37:55 - so
37:56 - if you see here we went from using async
38:00 - right so we're using async
38:05 - to using
38:06 - just a normal um promise with our
38:11 - with our fetch
38:13 - okay so that's what i suspected needed
38:15 - to happen
38:17 - and let's download this
38:19 - test it out
38:20 - and uh hopefully it'll work we're going
38:22 - to use browser stack to do some testing
38:24 - because we need that
38:26 - safari 9.1
38:29 - i see igor just asked uh what's the
38:32 - lowest safari version you're supporting
38:34 - with this project
38:35 - to be honest with you i wasn't worried
38:37 - about supporting older browsers because
38:39 - this is an internal project and everyone
38:41 - working at the university should be
38:43 - getting updates on their browsers so i
38:46 - generally don't worry about supporting
38:48 - older browsers because i think it's bad
38:49 - practice in general
38:51 - uh for internal websites because it just
38:53 - enables
38:54 - users to not update their browsers
38:57 - uh which potentially could have you know
38:59 - security issues
39:01 - but in this case since it's the head of
39:03 - my department that was having issues i
39:05 - need to fix this
39:08 - and i haven't had any uh complaints from
39:11 - anyone else so i don't know if other
39:13 - users happen to be using that same
39:15 - version of safari but it's entirely
39:16 - possible that they are
39:18 - so i'm just going to fix this
39:23 - okay
39:25 - and by me i mean helder is going to fix
39:28 - this so i did do some uh some testing
39:31 - and research on the issue uh before i
39:34 - made before i made the issue on the
39:36 - repository but
39:38 - as you can see helder actually did the
39:40 - the work coding so let's see what what
39:43 - is this 65
39:45 - okay so let me let me bring over
39:50 - the
39:51 - terminal window for this
39:54 - so we do have
39:57 - you know what i have some changes that i
39:59 - had already made
40:01 - where am i at
40:02 - um
40:04 - here right
40:09 - resource in it let's go to our bulletin
40:11 - and
40:13 - no no no resource center that's where
40:15 - we're at so the project is resource
40:16 - center let me undo all my tests
40:21 - because i messed this
40:22 - up pretty thoroughly
40:26 - uh
40:28 - all right
40:29 - and
40:32 - let's do
40:34 - let's do status view story.js
40:36 - no i have not updated this
40:39 - um
40:41 - if you're not sure what i'm doing i'm
40:44 - trying to get rid of my my tests my
40:46 - changes
40:48 - because i don't want those to be
40:52 - to be committed
40:53 - are included at all
40:55 - let's see what it says i've changed
40:59 - project description
41:02 - name email that's interesting
41:07 - so what does it think it was
41:11 - i'm gonna do a git diff to see what
41:13 - changed
41:15 - okay that's interesting it says that
41:18 - i've actually added this line in
41:23 - interesting
41:29 - hmm
41:40 - and i don't really want that added in
41:42 - right
41:43 - i do not so let's see
41:46 - what i want is that to say
41:49 - story
41:50 - and not project description so let me go
41:57 - let me change that
41:59 - actually could it be
42:04 - it's already up to date
42:06 - that's odd that's really odd i thought i
42:08 - had fixed that at some point
42:11 - anyway
42:12 - uh let's just go ahead and change that
42:13 - back then
42:19 - there we go now what we should have when
42:22 - we do a git status is that nothing is
42:24 - here so
42:25 - uh we don't see that little asterisk
42:28 - anymore so that means nothing's there
42:30 - okay great
42:32 - let's do it get
42:35 - fetch
42:37 - origin pool
42:39 - and this was 65 i believe
42:42 - we can always double check
42:44 - 65 yep
42:47 - and and we'll do uh let's see
42:51 - this is from helder
42:54 - um
42:58 - so
42:59 - there
43:00 - and
43:01 - let's go
43:04 - safari bug
43:12 - so now we're moving to that branch
43:15 - and
43:16 - we're going to type in yarn just to be
43:18 - sure although uh it shouldn't do
43:20 - anything okay great
43:22 - now let's merge
43:27 - master
43:28 - which is up to date so awesome so
43:30 - everything's up to date now here's what
43:32 - we're going to do
43:33 - i'm going to run
43:36 - ngrok
43:38 - which where's my ngrok server at
43:42 - maybe i have it on here instead
43:45 - uh so i have n grog running somewhere
43:48 - or i had it running i stopped it
43:51 - from the last time there we go okay so
43:53 - what ngrok is going to do
43:55 - is this is going to allow me
43:57 - to test this
43:59 - from anywhere
44:00 - so
44:02 - um i'll paste i'll go ahead and paste
44:04 - this in the description in case you want
44:05 - to test it or i'm sorry in the live chat
44:08 - so ngrok is now giving me a link
44:13 - to this even though it's running locally
44:16 - now you all uh can
44:19 - can test it out
44:21 - i'm going to run browser stack so if
44:23 - you're not familiar with browser stack
44:30 - it lets you run
44:33 - your your sites test out sites on
44:37 - different operating systems different
44:39 - browsers
44:40 - so oops
44:42 - oops i forgot i was on chrome canary
44:46 - let's try
44:47 - browser stack this would be a lot easier
44:49 - to log in like this okay so i'm already
44:52 - logged in so here's browser stack let me
44:55 - zoom in a bit so you can see so i have a
44:57 - choice to run this on
45:00 - you could see a lot of different mobile
45:01 - devices
45:03 - but i'm going to go down here to mac and
45:05 - let's try
45:07 - el capitan so
45:10 - we're going to go 9.1 on el capitan
45:15 - and it's actually going to start up
45:20 - that browser device combo
45:24 - once that starts up
45:26 - we're going to visit that ngrok link
45:29 - that i just pasted in
45:31 - and we're gonna try to submit
45:36 - that form
45:38 - so
45:39 - for me it i had a previous ngrok link in
45:42 - that obviously is not working now
45:44 - because i shut down that
45:46 - that link great so now we're in
45:49 - as you can see we're in here
45:51 - i can
45:52 - from in here i can inspect
45:56 - so you can see i can bring up
45:59 - the dev tools the safari dev tools
46:02 - and inspect things and
46:05 - the console will be most helpful to us i
46:07 - suppose
46:08 - so i'm going to go into that suggest a
46:10 - story form since it's a lot easier to
46:12 - fill out than the other form and
46:17 - there we go there's a slight lag but i'm
46:21 - when i'm doing this but it's not
46:23 - unreasonable
46:28 - and
46:33 - do the test
46:34 - and
46:36 - submit
46:39 - oh
46:42 - interesting
46:44 - type there object entries is not
46:47 - function
46:49 - okay so we are getting an error here
46:54 - i can uh i have my email open on another
46:57 - screen so i can tell whether or not an
47:00 - email was sent or whether the error
47:02 - completely stopped it it looks like it's
47:03 - completely stopped
47:07 - all right so
47:08 - i know this is really small
47:12 - i can't the the zoom is not working for
47:15 - me so
47:16 - um
47:18 - let me bring this
47:20 - whoops
47:27 - again let me just read off this error
47:29 - then so we have a type error object dot
47:32 - entries is not a function
47:36 - so it says
47:37 - in object dot entries uh this state form
47:41 - object dot entries is undefined
47:44 - so
47:46 - let's check that out in the code
47:49 - so we have our
47:51 - dot story.js and
47:53 - down here where we're doing our
47:57 - handle form data
48:00 - this is where we have object dot entries
48:02 - this state form
48:06 - so
48:11 - interesting
48:16 - i'm just going to choose this undefined
48:24 - i wonder uh
48:36 - hmm
48:59 - nothing huh
49:02 - that's interesting
49:12 - is
49:13 - all right so here's what i'm thinking
49:15 - maybe
49:16 - object
49:18 - dot entries
49:21 - is not supported
49:38 - well let's just
49:45 - all right let's check it out in uh mdn
49:49 - and it should tell us here at the bottom
49:51 - where we could use it
49:53 - oh okay
49:54 - so the compatibility uh here says it's
49:57 - available in safari 10.1 we are testing
50:00 - it at 9.1 so that would make sense
50:03 - um
50:05 - okay
50:07 - so it seems like
50:14 - seems like we need a polyfill right
50:39 - let me deploy polyfill listed below
50:54 - let's see if we can just copy this
50:56 - polyfill
50:57 - and uh and get it to work
51:00 - um
51:03 - just i mean this will just kind of
51:05 - really tell us
51:07 - where the problem is i suppose
51:10 - let's get rid of that
51:14 - let's see
51:22 - okay
51:24 - so we should be able to go
51:26 - back to our
51:29 - uh browser stack this should have auto
51:32 - refreshed okay blake has a question here
51:34 - i just noticed
51:37 - asking what does a polyfill do okay so
51:39 - let's let's go over this nice this is a
51:41 - really great question so a polyfill is a
51:44 - way for you to use some newer syntax
51:48 - with older browsers so let's just check
51:50 - out what this particular polyfill is
51:52 - doing so it's checking to see
51:54 - um if object entries doesn't exist so
51:57 - you know we see that um
52:00 - exclamation point there which is
52:01 - basically just the opposite so if object
52:05 - dot entries doesn't exist meaning it's
52:07 - not supported by that browser then we're
52:10 - going to create object dot entries so
52:13 - essentially it's just making it anyway
52:15 - and then it's making a function that
52:17 - takes in an object
52:19 - okay so it's going to do object keys on
52:22 - that object all right and it's basically
52:24 - going to do pretty much the same thing
52:27 - as object dot entries would do but it's
52:30 - using syntax
52:33 - that is acceptable
52:36 - for older browsers or it's using
52:40 - you know other other methods so the
52:42 - objects.keys that's acceptable for older
52:44 - browsers so when we add this in what
52:46 - should happen and we're going to test in
52:48 - a second
52:49 - is that
52:51 - on newer browsers this will completely
52:53 - get skipped over and everything will
52:55 - work as normal but on browsers that
52:57 - don't support
52:58 - object.entries instead
53:01 - this function will run and it should
53:03 - return something that will allow our our
53:06 - forms to work properly
53:08 - uh even if it's in an older browser so i
53:10 - believe
53:12 - from what this was saying that this will
53:14 - not work in older versions of internet
53:16 - explorer i have no intention of
53:17 - supporting older versions of internet
53:19 - explorer so i'm not worried about that
53:21 - but it looks like there are some
53:22 - alternatives if you do need to support
53:25 - older versions of ie
53:29 - so
53:30 - hopefully that made sense uh if anybody
53:32 - else has some more insight on what
53:34 - polyfills are what they do
53:36 - please put it in the live chat now
53:39 - always appreciate expertise from from
53:42 - you all
53:43 - so let's let's try this out again
53:56 - it's a test all right submit
54:01 - error no the page integral is not
54:04 - allowed to display insecure content
54:08 - from n rock
54:22 - all right let me try this
54:25 - so let me try another link and then test
54:28 - it again so it looks like there was some
54:29 - issue because i was using https
54:34 - uh so let's go with
54:37 - the non
54:39 - https or just the regular http link
54:42 - and give it another shot
54:45 - see if that makes a difference but we
54:47 - weren't getting the uh object.entries
54:50 - error so i'm assuming that that was
54:52 - corrected
54:53 - but we'll try to verify and get an
54:55 - actual submission to go through
55:07 - okay
55:08 - now let's submit
55:17 - so
55:18 - nothing happened
55:22 - and we get no
55:23 - errors in the console
55:27 - all right i don't like this
55:30 - this is no good
55:35 - uh let's check our network see what's
55:37 - happening
55:38 - share a story
55:44 - and we should be sending
55:48 - where's our fetch
55:58 - upload where's our upload url
56:01 - and we defined it up here
56:04 - story form so are we actually submitting
56:07 - sorry for this being so small
56:10 - um
56:12 - error occurred okay now we finally got
56:15 - an error let's see what it was
56:22 - okay so it looks like it's a um access
56:25 - control origin thing
56:28 - where are we sending these
56:42 - i saw
56:45 - all right let's double check
56:49 - our
56:50 - server
57:11 - you know what this is the one where
57:13 - we're sending with sendgrid correct
57:15 - uh probably what's happening is
57:20 - i have um a white list of domains when
57:23 - my sendgrid api and i don't have this
57:27 - domain included so
57:29 - here's what i'm going to do
57:31 - i'm going to
57:32 - copy this
57:34 - let me copy this
57:38 - add it to the api and then we should um
57:42 - we should be okay so
57:44 - uh i'm going to do this on my other
57:46 - screen for sendgrid uh just so that i
57:48 - don't accidentally show something on
57:50 - youtube that i should not in terms of
57:52 - user data
57:56 - but basically
57:57 - what i'm doing here is just
58:00 - adding a url to the whitelist
58:03 - for
58:05 - for this particular
58:07 - api key that i'm using
58:11 - so if you if you want to know how i'm
58:13 - doing this in sendgrid you just log into
58:15 - your sendgrid account and then on your
58:17 - side menu you go to settings and then
58:19 - api keys and then you just select the
58:21 - api key
58:23 - that you would like to edit
58:26 - edit your key
58:28 - [Music]
58:30 - interesting
58:38 - maybe i don't
58:44 - domains
58:50 - that's interesting
58:52 - it looks like i don't have
58:58 - the api key
59:01 - set up with any type of white list
59:10 - interesting
59:13 - okay
59:15 - then
59:19 - that's crazy
59:21 - alright so what is the problem
59:35 - hmm
59:36 - uh it might be
59:39 - it might be the way we're running this
59:40 - server actually
59:50 - you know what let's it i it probably is
59:54 - that let's shut this down
59:56 - and let's go
60:00 - thousand
60:13 - okay so
60:14 - uh it's been a while since i worked on
60:16 - this project so i had forgotten that the
60:18 - way we're running this is um there's a
60:22 - server running on
60:23 - there's a version of the site running on
60:25 - localhost 3000 and in this case 2001
60:28 - and that one works except the forms
60:31 - don't work but then we had another one
60:32 - running on port 9000 and that one worked
60:35 - with the form so that is probably our
60:38 - error so my 25 minute timer is just
60:42 - ended but i want to do one more test
60:44 - since we're so close
60:54 - let's see let's submit this
60:58 - and see
61:00 - what happens
61:05 - okay so so far nothing
61:10 - um
61:13 - there's a network
61:22 - let's get xhr
61:35 - all right well
61:40 - we're not getting anything
61:56 - hmm
62:00 - we're not getting any errors in the
62:01 - console
62:14 - that's odd
62:23 - oops
62:26 - let's try one more thing
62:30 - one more thing before we stop
62:48 - so let me see this
62:56 - let's let me check out our
62:59 - package json file and see
63:09 - okay so we should be starting those
63:10 - servers right
63:23 - foreign
63:39 - hmm
63:50 - let's build
64:04 - okay so i'm gonna run this i'm gonna try
64:07 - one more time
64:09 - no matter what happens this next time
64:10 - i'm gonna go to finish up with some
64:12 - question and answer stuff
64:14 - uh i'm not i'm not gonna go through the
64:16 - process it let's say this works i'm not
64:18 - gonna go through the process of actually
64:19 - merging this in we've already done it
64:21 - twice
64:22 - i don't really think
64:23 - there's there's much value in doing it
64:25 - again
64:27 - um
64:29 - the only difference would be
64:32 - after i did all this i would then
64:35 - actually go onto the server and update
64:37 - the the live server
64:42 - okay
64:43 - so let's
64:47 - let's go with
64:49 - start
64:51 - start that server
64:53 - and
64:55 - for sure
65:00 - okay
65:03 - let's double check
65:09 - okay great that is working
65:12 - and
65:14 - where's our
65:19 - where's our browser stack there it is
65:23 - okay
65:25 - i'm going to go ahead and do a refresh
65:27 - just to make sure it should auto refresh
65:29 - on us but
65:32 - i just want to make sure everything is
65:34 - is working properly
65:53 - let's submit
65:56 - all right okay it says your story
65:58 - suggestion was sent successfully okay
66:02 - and i will verify by checking my email
66:06 - that i am i should be getting an email
66:08 - update
66:10 - uh somewhere
66:21 - let's see
66:30 - so i've gotten nothing so far
66:34 - but
66:39 - oh you know what
66:40 - uh since we're in testing mode it's
66:42 - probably turned off
66:45 - uh so
66:47 - that's why i'm not actually getting the
66:48 - email but
66:50 - uh we did get
66:52 - we did get a success
66:55 - message so
66:58 - i'm happy with that
67:01 - awesome so uh with just you know we had
67:04 - to add that polyfill in there uh which
67:06 - is okay
67:08 - uh what i'll have to do then uh it's not
67:10 - exactly ready to merge in yet because
67:12 - i'll have to add the same polyfill into
67:14 - for the other form
67:16 - uh there's probably a better way to do
67:18 - that so i don't have to repeat the same
67:20 - code so
67:23 - maybe i'll
67:27 - i don't know i don't mind repeating
67:29 - something twice if i had to repeat it
67:30 - more than twice it might be worth it to
67:32 - maybe make it a separate component put
67:34 - it in the utils folder
67:37 - uh
67:38 - we'll see
67:40 - um but i'd have to do that
67:42 - then merge it uh put it on github i'll
67:45 - pull it into the server so if anybody's
67:47 - interested in that whole process um
67:50 - maybe i could i could show that on a
67:53 - stream in the future
67:54 - um
67:55 - just let me know
67:57 - but otherwise i think the the problem
67:59 - seems to be solved so
68:02 - thank you again uh helder for that pull
68:05 - request
68:06 - and um
68:08 - so if anybody feels like browsing this
68:11 - site on
68:12 - internet or on safari 9.1
68:15 - it'll work now so
68:18 - all right
68:22 - so let me scroll up a bit to where i
68:24 - left off in the live chat
68:26 - and uh answer uh
68:28 - as many questions as i can
68:34 - let's see
68:47 - okay cool so um i if you remember
68:49 - earlier in the stream i was asking
68:51 - arvind about his work situation since he
68:54 - uh
68:55 - said he just left
68:56 - uh left his job uh arvin says i've
68:59 - decided to learn from you and do some
69:01 - freelancing it'll give me more time to
69:03 - learn all right that's awesome that's
69:05 - awesome i mean hopefully hopefully i can
69:07 - help out with that and and you'll learn
69:09 - some things uh feel free to
69:11 - you know ask me what you know whatever
69:13 - you want to uh you can message me on
69:14 - twitter or you know or whatever
69:17 - we're just asking the live chat happy to
69:19 - help
69:20 - and uh freelancing is it's nice um
69:24 - if you get some steady clients it can be
69:26 - it can be really nice
69:29 - let's see
69:34 - right c says i'm doing the same as you
69:36 - and my life hasn't been better pure
69:38 - happiness for now awesome
69:40 - that's awesome i'm glad to hear that
70:01 - okay oh uh musa says i must leave now
70:04 - thanks for the stream man good afternoon
70:06 - so i'm sure moose already left but uh in
70:08 - case uh that you watch this recording uh
70:11 - i'll see you later and uh thanks for
70:13 - watching the stream and and joining in
70:15 - the live chat i appreciate it
70:21 - world says browser support like internet
70:24 - explorer or safari makes me want to
70:26 - leave web dev
70:28 - i feel like i'm fixing fixing vhs for a
70:31 - living
70:33 - yeah i'm not really uh
70:35 - i don't really like supporting older
70:37 - browsers either
70:40 - but um
70:41 - luckily i don't really have to that much
70:46 - so i think i have it better than than
70:48 - other people
70:50 - in that regard so
70:52 - it could be a lot worse
70:56 - but yeah
70:57 - i really
70:58 - i don't really honestly internet
71:00 - explorer does
71:02 - upset me sometimes with just the weird
71:04 - errors but to be honest with you safari
71:07 - is pretty bad too especially on mobile
71:11 - mobile safari is like
71:14 - i think
71:15 - right there in the running for worst
71:17 - browser uh to have to deal with as a
71:19 - developer
71:20 - so
71:22 - if anybody on the safari team
71:25 - is watching i apologize i don't mean
71:28 - that in any way um to belittle your work
71:31 - or anything
71:32 - um but
71:34 - i just happen to have had
71:36 - a lot of bugs on mobile safari with some
71:39 - of the stuff that i built
71:51 - this is interesting arvin says i learned
71:54 - vue.js as i found it easier than
71:56 - angularjs and guess what i don't find i
72:00 - can't find any jobs for view developers
72:02 - in india
72:04 - that's actually i mean that's
72:06 - interesting
72:07 - i've always wondered about vue i know a
72:09 - lot of people like view but i don't
72:12 - frequently see view mentioned
72:14 - in job descriptions now i'm
72:17 - i'm not really looking at that many job
72:19 - descriptions but
72:21 - i i don't recall it being mentioned
72:23 - often
72:25 - so i kind of wondered what
72:28 - you know what the job outlook was like
72:30 - for view developers
72:35 - excuse me
72:36 - try to have the yawn
72:39 - uh
72:41 - i'm i'm highly caffeinated at this point
72:43 - so i was i'm surprised by the yawn
72:48 - okay i guess that's good to keep in mind
72:50 - i mean of course this is anecdotal it's
72:52 - it's in no way
72:54 - uh a study of you jobs but
72:57 - i i have kind of wondered about that
73:10 - all right rook says uh the can i use
73:12 - site is pretty nice for browser support
73:14 - information
73:15 - uh let's end this session um
73:19 - yeah if you didn't if you've never used
73:21 - can i use before it's it's simply can i
73:24 - use dot com
73:25 - you type in what you want to do
73:29 - and uh
73:30 - normally i almost always find what i'm
73:33 - looking for for some reason i couldn't
73:35 - find object dot entries
73:38 - but it works for javascript stuff like
73:40 - this or even css like
73:44 - let's go like flexbox right so
73:48 - you don't have to specify you just type
73:49 - something in you'll get the javascript
73:51 - and css and you know it it'll show you
73:54 - what it's supported with so if you want
73:56 - to use flex
73:58 - and css
73:59 - it'll say you know okay internet
74:01 - explorer 11 has partial support even
74:03 - explains what that means
74:05 - um and looks like all the other browsers
74:08 - have full support
74:10 - so
74:11 - really useful
74:14 - super fast to search through i use this
74:16 - often
74:24 - okay igor says it should be a lot of
74:25 - freelance tasks or outsource projects on
74:28 - vue.js
74:29 - okay
74:30 - um
74:31 - yeah that's that's a good suggestion you
74:33 - know maybe there's not full-time view
74:35 - developers uh
74:37 - it's possible there's not a lot of those
74:38 - jobs but you know freelancing
74:41 - uh you know temporary projects i guess
74:43 - are a way to go
74:52 - oh okay sebastian noticed on that
74:55 - bulletin project that
74:58 - when you click on continue reading that
75:01 - is also only in
75:05 - grid view let's see
75:11 - actually now i'm clicking this sebastian
75:13 - and it looks like oh i'm sorry
75:16 - um
75:18 - i clicked the wrong thing let me
75:20 - let's go continue reading where are we
75:23 - at
75:25 - need to find something that says
75:26 - continue reading
75:28 - oh you know what
75:30 - continue reading is only a great video
75:33 - oh i see what you're saying now actually
75:35 - that's how i want it so
75:37 - i'm currently on the site i have it so
75:39 - that
75:40 - in this list view
75:42 - there is no continue reading the entire
75:45 - text
75:47 - appears so that's actually how i want it
75:50 - because i had complaints initially i had
75:53 - complaints from users
75:55 - because they wanted to be able to just
75:56 - scroll through and see everything and
75:58 - not have to click to read more
76:01 - so what i did as kind of a compromise
76:03 - was in the grid
76:04 - view because these cards were more
76:08 - narrow and you could potentially have a
76:09 - very long scroll
76:11 - if there were a lot of there's a lot of
76:12 - content i left that
76:16 - with the continue reading but in the
76:18 - list view
76:20 - we
76:21 - show everything
76:24 - the full content
76:29 - so
76:30 - it that actually is how it how it's
76:32 - supposed to work
76:35 - but sebastian you have uh
76:38 - great like attention for detail
76:41 - um
76:44 - yeah that was that was pretty good about
76:46 - noticing that
76:55 - arvin says what freelancing website
76:57 - would you suggest apart from freelancer
77:02 - um
77:03 - igor says have you tried upwork
77:06 - uh
77:10 - let's see
77:12 - i
77:13 - i
77:14 - i have not tried upwork i know you're
77:16 - asking um
77:18 - uh you're having a conversation with
77:20 - igor on there but uh in case
77:23 - you know anybody else wants to to join
77:25 - in here
77:26 - um
77:28 - i'm just kind of reading it out a bit
77:33 - i've not tried upwork so i can't vouch
77:36 - for that
77:37 - i have tried freelancer
77:40 - i didn't have a great experience with it
77:41 - it seemed to me like
77:44 - the uh the pay was just way too low for
77:47 - a lot of the projects um
77:49 - there's a lot of competition a lot of
77:51 - people trying to you know undercut
77:54 - and bid lower than other people
77:57 - i i didn't find it to be really worth my
77:59 - time unless
78:00 - i really didn't have anything else going
78:02 - on
78:04 - uh so
78:06 - i didn't like it i i um
78:11 - i think it's more promising some of the
78:13 - sites like uh top towel
78:16 - basically any site where um they
78:20 - you you have to test to be accepted as a
78:23 - developer so
78:25 - they only take quality developers who
78:27 - can pass the tests and then they match
78:29 - you up with companies
78:31 - who are actually willing to pay
78:34 - you know a fair amount of money
78:37 - to get a good developer
78:40 - so if you can find something like that
78:44 - either top towel or something that that
78:47 - operates like that
78:49 - i think that's that's the best bet if i
78:51 - ever go back to freelancing i will
78:53 - probably do that
78:55 - um
78:58 - yeah that's so that's kind of my advice
79:01 - about freelancing if you
79:03 - the thing about freelancing i i talked a
79:06 - lot about freelancing last week so i'm
79:08 - not going to talk a lot about it now
79:10 - but i'll just say
79:12 - freelancing is
79:15 - about selling yourself
79:18 - to a certain extent
79:20 - so you're not going to be able to spend
79:21 - all your time coding and learning if you
79:23 - want to actually make money you have to
79:24 - sell yourself if you're not comfortable
79:26 - with that
79:29 - you almost have to be a marketer uh in a
79:31 - sense but if you're not comfortable with
79:33 - that freelancing may not be for you
79:34 - unless you can find someone a company
79:37 - like top towel or maybe a small business
79:39 - or something that will be the middle man
79:42 - you know kind of the go between between
79:44 - clients
79:45 - and and you
79:47 - they can handle contracts they can
79:49 - handle payment
79:50 - uh things like that that will allow you
79:53 - to spend your time doing what you want
79:55 - which i assume is coding
79:58 - and not worrying about the you know
80:00 - these other things
80:02 - so
80:03 - for me
80:05 - that's more of the ideal freelancer
80:07 - situation uh because
80:09 - you know while i do have experience with
80:11 - marketing and things
80:13 - i
80:14 - i'd rather not i enjoy the coding more
80:17 - so
80:18 - anyway just something to keep in mind
80:34 - world said i like how you say
80:37 - interesting instead of cursing like i do
80:40 - [Music]
80:41 - yeah so i i assume that you'd said that
80:44 - whenever i got the error in the console
80:46 - there yeah so um
80:50 - i um i purposely
80:52 - never curse on this stream i know i have
80:57 - some younger viewers
81:00 - so i i wouldn't want to
81:03 - expose them to any words that their
81:05 - parents may not want them to hear and
81:07 - potentially i may have older viewers
81:08 - that just would prefer not to hear that
81:10 - language so i like to keep it pg rated
81:13 - or g or whatever
81:15 - so
81:17 - anyway yeah so you will not hear me
81:20 - curse
81:21 - on this stream
81:22 - and um
81:25 - i have four little kids so i get a lot
81:28 - of practice at
81:29 - controlling my language even when i get
81:32 - upset about something
81:35 - um
81:37 - let's see
81:38 - so when i'm not streaming though
81:42 - uh
81:44 - i i
81:45 - i have
81:47 - i have said some uh some curse words at
81:50 - the computer
81:52 - uh luckily i have an office with my door
81:55 - shut and everything so
81:57 - there's no danger of being overheard
82:10 - uh my uh my spotify playlist has ended
82:14 - so
82:16 - uh
82:17 - gotta put another playlist on it's
82:19 - really weird to try to do the stream
82:21 - with nothing in the background
82:24 - let's see
82:33 - michael crow says take your break now if
82:35 - you don't you'll be banging your head
82:36 - against the wall for the next hour
82:38 - trying one more thing
82:42 - you're right if that if that last thing
82:44 - hadn't worked i
82:46 - i was definitely in danger of doing just
82:48 - that
82:49 - uh you're a smart man
82:53 - igor says that thing always happens one
82:55 - more thing
82:57 - one another thing and oops you have been
82:59 - working for a couple hours without a
83:00 - break yeah that's true i don't know how
83:02 - many times my wife has called and said
83:04 - when are you gonna come home from work
83:06 - it's getting late and i'll say okay i'm
83:08 - working on this i'm just gonna try one
83:09 - more thing and
83:11 - yeah and then i end up
83:13 - being here for
83:15 - much longer
83:20 - okay world says you demand safari nine
83:22 - users should be grateful cool i hope so
83:25 - i'm gonna have to uh next time i see the
83:28 - the my department head i'll tell her
83:30 - that it now works she'll be should be
83:33 - happy
83:39 - okay blake says by the way i messed
83:40 - around with figma the wireframing tool
83:43 - it's not bad okay cool
83:45 - so at some point maybe last week
83:47 - sometime we were talking about uh free
83:49 - wireframing tools i believe we were uh
83:53 - specifically wanted ones that worked for
83:55 - windows and figma came up so
83:58 - for for any of you that were in on that
84:00 - conversation or interested in
84:01 - wireframing tools uh for windows
84:05 - that are free check out figma
84:08 - figma
84:13 - rook says what's your opinion on
84:14 - stricter linting rules like the airbnb
84:18 - preset for eslint
84:20 - um
84:22 - i i don't know i
84:24 - to me
84:26 - the linting rules
84:30 - i like the idea of linting rules right
84:32 - so you know like on our on a lot of our
84:34 - projects we've set up um
84:36 - some linting uh rules we even have the
84:39 - auto formatting uh that enforces things
84:41 - like that and i like that it brings a
84:44 - lot of consistency
84:47 - in particular the airbnb rules i don't
84:50 - really have a comment on that because
84:51 - it's been a very long time since i've
84:53 - even looked at them i don't really
84:54 - remember too much of what it is so
84:57 - but in general
84:59 - uh you know stricter linting rules i
85:01 - don't have a problem with as long as
85:04 - they don't slow down development
85:06 - significantly so
85:08 - um
85:11 - i don't mind like when we're doing the
85:13 - auto uh
85:16 - you know the auto formatting with
85:18 - standard js and prettier
85:22 - uh i'm okay with that
85:24 - people you know can
85:26 - do whatever they want in terms of how
85:28 - they code and then it just gets
85:31 - when they go to commit it just gets
85:33 - converted to how i want it
85:35 - that's okay
85:36 - um
85:40 - yeah i i would say it would almost
85:42 - depend like on a case by case it depends
85:44 - on like what are those rules in
85:46 - particular and really it's it'd be more
85:48 - of a personal thing if the rules were a
85:51 - lot of things that bother me
85:53 - then i wouldn't like it uh but if the
85:55 - rules are really specific and happen to
85:57 - be like just how i like things i'd
85:59 - probably be okay with it so
86:02 - um
86:03 - i haven't actually given that much
86:05 - thought to it so this is kind of just
86:06 - off the top of my head but i'm not
86:09 - i'm not opposed to strict linting rules
86:12 - but it just really would depend
86:14 - on
86:16 - you know what what are those rules uh in
86:19 - general i
86:22 - uh
86:23 - i like spaces and not tabs so two spaces
86:27 - uh i don't like to use semicolons
86:30 - um
86:32 - i like having properties like if we're
86:35 - talking about react uh you know
86:37 - properties on diff separate lines
86:40 - i think that makes it a lot easier uh to
86:43 - read
86:44 - it does make the code longer
86:47 - but is you should be keeping your
86:48 - components as short as possible
86:51 - so assuming you're doing that it helps
86:53 - with readability and the length isn't
86:55 - too bad so
86:58 - that's my preference
87:02 - uh
87:03 - what do you all think
87:04 - um
87:07 - i mean i like and what do you all think
87:08 - about what we have set up now i mean i
87:10 - i've really been liking the uh kind of
87:12 - the auto formatting rules that we have
87:15 - set up
87:16 - um
87:17 - but you know what do you uh what is your
87:19 - opinion on it i definitely like to know
87:25 - oh igor says we just switched to that
87:28 - those rules they are awful all right so
87:30 - we got one vote for awful in terms of
87:32 - the airbnb
87:34 - rules
87:41 - oh okay so sebastian says i'm looking on
87:44 - when you click on a category or other
87:46 - button in the drawer it shows a red or
87:48 - blue color
87:50 - oh okay
87:52 - yeah it does
87:53 - uh so we'll definitely want to change
87:55 - that you know what i i have noticed that
87:57 - before
87:59 - okay
88:00 - yeah so we definitely want to change
88:02 - that
88:03 - um
88:04 - i'm actually okay with this gray color
88:06 - that you can see right now it's showing
88:08 - uh as opposed to the red
88:10 - uh the gray is fine with me or one of
88:13 - the colors that we're already using in
88:15 - the color palette
88:17 - would also be
88:19 - be okay with me
88:24 - uh
88:26 - let's see so thanks sebastian um
88:32 - okay so sebastian notice it's just for
88:34 - the ones that are a link component okay
88:37 - um
88:38 - yeah i'll have to check that out
88:41 - person says hi i'm new hey how's it
88:44 - going thanks for joining us uh in the in
88:46 - the live chat and uh welcome
88:51 - uh robert says i created a getter if
88:54 - anyone wants to join if we have
88:56 - questions or can help each other outside
88:58 - of the live chat uh jesse let me know if
89:00 - i can share the link yeah go ahead and
89:02 - share the link that's awesome yeah we we
89:05 - actually have a um we have a slack
89:07 - channel too
89:09 - and i um
89:11 - i have not gone through the process to
89:12 - be able to efficiently accept people
89:15 - into that slack channel i know there's a
89:16 - way you can set it up so that'll just
89:18 - automatically
89:20 - let you
89:22 - get an invite and i just haven't really
89:25 - taken the time to do that uh yet
89:29 - uh so if you'd like to be a part of that
89:31 - your best bet maybe is to just send me a
89:34 - um
89:34 - a message
89:37 - let me know what email you want to use
89:38 - to sign up
89:42 - until i can get that and uh but getter
89:44 - sounds cool though to use because then
89:46 - we wouldn't have the issues um in terms
89:49 - of invites that we have with slack
90:14 - blake says my mom would appreciate that
90:17 - i'm not sure what that was in response
90:19 - to uh was that is it something in the
90:22 - chat or something i said so i don't
90:25 - let me know
90:29 - uh sebastian says submitted pull request
90:31 - to fix what you said about the close
90:33 - icon and fixed up the bug of the grid
90:36 - all right awesome sebastian thank you so
90:38 - much that was so quick
90:39 - i really appreciate that
90:41 - oh okay blake says the language all
90:44 - right
90:44 - okay cool so that was i mentioned
90:47 - earlier that i i
90:49 - don't uh use any bad language or cursing
90:52 - on the stream
90:54 - uh one reason being
90:56 - for our younger
91:00 - younger viewers i don't know that their
91:02 - parents would appreciate that uh so
91:05 - yeah
91:06 - um
91:08 - yeah i personally don't have an issue
91:10 - with uh with cursing but i would have an
91:14 - issue with someone cursing around my
91:15 - children
91:16 - so i'm definitely sensitive to that
91:20 - so
91:24 - i'm always um
91:27 - i don't know about you all but i'm
91:29 - always amazed at uh what i hear um some
91:32 - people saying around their children like
91:35 - in public
91:36 - um i don't know i mean i guess it's just
91:38 - what you were used to growing up but
91:41 - um
91:43 - i don't know my mom never said a curse
91:45 - word i only heard my mom say curse word
91:47 - one time her entire life is we we almost
91:49 - got into a wreck
91:50 - and um so she said it uh my dad was
91:55 - he he cares a little bit more but never
91:57 - um
91:59 - almost never anything like really vulgar
92:02 - you know
92:03 - um
92:04 - but anyway
92:09 - yeah i just i think it's a good um
92:12 - it's a good skill to be able to have to
92:14 - control your language based on who your
92:17 - audience is or what situation you're in
92:20 - um i it just kind of shows like um
92:24 - an element of self-control and and being
92:27 - able to control
92:28 - uh your thoughts
92:30 - so i like that i like to see that in a
92:32 - person like that that ability
92:46 - let's see
92:49 - all right uh seems like
92:53 - i've i've gone through everything in the
92:56 - live chat
92:57 - so yep
92:58 - uh if i happen to miss your comment or
93:00 - question i'm sorry about that i do try
93:02 - to get to everything
93:04 - um
93:06 - but uh occasionally i missed something
93:09 - so if i did feel free to reach out to me
93:11 - on on twitter or any other social media
93:14 - that uh you can find me on um
93:16 - or just you know come back for another
93:18 - stream and ask me
93:20 - uh okay blake did ask can you do a live
93:22 - stream on deploying a react website yeah
93:25 - i definitely can oh actually i'm so glad
93:27 - that you um
93:29 - that you said that uh so i have more
93:32 - information for you all uh in regard to
93:34 - this bulletin website we've been working
93:36 - on so for the last um
93:40 - for the last
93:42 - maybe two weeks or more i've been
93:44 - talking about
93:45 - the the login system so currently we
93:47 - have set up a heart should set it up a
93:50 - passwordless login system that uses a
93:52 - link that you get via email
93:56 - what i'd like to do is to tie it in with
93:58 - the university single sign-on system
94:02 - that they're using for other things
94:05 - um i i talked with
94:08 - one of the meetings that i had today was
94:09 - kind of an unexpected meeting but i ran
94:12 - into some of the people in the i.t
94:14 - department who are in charge of the
94:15 - single sign-on and i asked them what
94:17 - they thought and uh what's gonna happen
94:19 - is over the christmas break for the
94:21 - university uh so the end of december
94:25 - they're going to
94:26 - switch everyone over to using office 365
94:29 - for the email and calendars and
94:31 - everything like that at that point
94:32 - everybody at the university is going to
94:34 - have their own microsoft account their
94:36 - on office 365 account
94:39 - and they're going to have to change some
94:40 - of the way they do single sign-on so
94:42 - what makes the most sense for this
94:44 - project is to wait until that happens
94:47 - uh and then
94:50 - what we probably would end up doing is
94:52 - having something come up that says like
94:54 - sign in with your office 365 account
94:59 - and then we'll have a check server side
95:02 - to say
95:03 - are they using a franciscan.edu address
95:07 - if so
95:09 - then go ahead go ahead with the office
95:11 - 365
95:12 - sign in if not then you'll give them a
95:16 - message saying hey you need a franciscan
95:18 - address
95:19 - uh i think that that
95:22 - that may end up being the best way to go
95:24 - about it and possibly the simplest way
95:27 - because i'm sure there is already
95:30 - some code out there
95:31 - for using sign in with with office 365
95:35 - or with your microsoft account
95:37 - and react
95:40 - it seems to me like that would be
95:41 - something
95:43 - that people are doing somewhere so
95:46 - so that's what's gonna happen it doesn't
95:47 - need to happen until you know december
95:50 - probably january probably sometime in
95:52 - january it'll happen so
95:54 - we got a lot of time to think about it
95:56 - and to look for a solution and get that
95:57 - ready
96:00 - but what that does mean is
96:02 - we potentially could wait and not
96:04 - release this newer version that we've
96:06 - been working on
96:08 - until then
96:09 - or we can release it now with our our
96:12 - email link so we're gonna have to make a
96:14 - decision with that either way
96:17 - we have a lot of time now to really work
96:20 - on this and get it to a point where
96:23 - where it's how we like so
96:25 - we may slow down on this switch up to
96:27 - some other projects uh there's
96:29 - definitely time if we want to think
96:30 - about extra features that might be cool
96:33 - um
96:34 - we we have a lot of time so we
96:36 - essentially have
96:38 - like two two months potentially two and
96:41 - a half months now
96:43 - uh to work on this
96:45 - so
96:46 - um
96:49 - i mean in potential this is really
96:52 - it's functional now i mean i i i don't
96:56 - i wouldn't release it right now there's
96:58 - still some things like the filter by
97:00 - date doesn't work um
97:03 - and uh there's there's some things that
97:07 - i would change like design wise just
97:09 - really minor adjustments
97:12 - but potentially like you know this is
97:14 - you know 95
97:16 - operational at this point
97:19 - anyway basically what i'm trying to say
97:21 - is we got a lot of time to work on this
97:23 - now so if anyone has any ideas for
97:26 - features that could make it better i'm
97:28 - i'm open to considering them
97:31 - i can't guarantee they'll make it in
97:34 - although if you have a feature you think
97:35 - would be really cool and then you also
97:37 - submit a pull request for it then i'm
97:39 - much more likely to bring it in because
97:42 - it's it's already done
97:45 - anyway so i think it'll be cool i'm not
97:47 - excited about this because i think we
97:49 - can really uh make this
97:52 - you know better than the the current
97:55 - version that's live
97:56 - um
97:57 - and uh it'll be exciting so not only
98:00 - will we be able to give users a easier
98:03 - way to sign in that's tied in with all
98:05 - their other university accounts but also
98:08 - we may be able to give them some new
98:09 - features
98:10 - updated design
98:14 - it'll be nice and yeah i think it'll be
98:16 - really nice
98:19 - okay
98:20 - um
98:21 - okay robert also has uh has pasted in
98:24 - this getter channel
98:26 - um
98:27 - live coding with jesse
98:29 - free code camp lobby i'm gonna take this
98:32 - and
98:33 - paste it
98:35 - let's go over here
98:38 - okay cool this is some stuff i had from
98:40 - a previous stream so let me let me go
98:42 - down a bit
98:44 - and uh
98:45 - here
98:47 - this uh this link
98:50 - is for the getter let me uh copy this
98:52 - link over just to make sure that it
98:54 - works before i give it out to everyone
99:04 - it's not working for me what did i do
99:05 - wrong
99:16 - all right is that link working for
99:18 - anyone else uh getter dot i am slash
99:22 - live coding with jesse free code camp
99:24 - slash lobby
99:29 - because i'm getting a 404
99:31 - whenever i try to use that
99:34 - let me see
99:53 - okay
100:05 - okay i'm gonna wait a minute just to see
100:07 - if that getter link is working for
100:08 - anyone else because i want um
100:11 - not only people in the live chat but the
100:13 - people that are watching this later on i
100:15 - want to be able to give them the right
100:16 - link
100:17 - so
100:18 - also so robert says
100:21 - can you limit the single sign-on to ip
100:23 - address or can they also use a link on
100:27 - home computer i need to create the exact
100:29 - same thing but limit it
100:32 - to a word computer
100:34 - hmm
100:43 - you know what i'm not i've never really
100:45 - thought about that
100:47 - um
100:51 - yeah i don't know so
100:58 - i don't know does anyone have any
100:59 - thoughts on that how could we limit it
101:01 - to an ip
101:05 - i mean i suppose it's possible
101:08 - uh
101:11 - yeah
101:12 - yeah i would i would suppose it's
101:13 - possible
101:15 - right i mean we're limiting it to email
101:17 - address
101:19 - so if you could grab the ip
101:21 - and just limit it to the ip
101:26 - i suppose that would work
101:28 - but
101:30 - what's the potential for um faking an ip
101:33 - address how hard is that to do i don't
101:35 - know like how uh secure you need it to
101:38 - be
101:39 - here let me um put in the link that's
101:41 - actually working for me right now so
101:44 - this link is working so
101:47 - getter dot im
101:49 - slash live coding with jesse free code
