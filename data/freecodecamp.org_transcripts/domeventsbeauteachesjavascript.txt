00:00 - when an event occurs in the HTML Dom
00:03 - JavaScript code can be executed an
00:06 - example of an event is when a user
00:08 - clicks on an HTML element to execute
00:11 - code when a user clicks on an element
00:14 - just add JavaScript code to the onclick
00:16 - HTML attribute if you look at the HTML
00:19 - section we have the onclick attribute
00:22 - and there's a JavaScript Command right
00:24 - in here this doin HTML equals serial so
00:28 - I don't have anything in the JavaScript
00:30 - section over here but still when I click
00:33 - on what is my favorite food it becomes
00:35 - cereal you'll notice I also have some
00:37 - CSS here this is kind of just for fun I
00:39 - just thought it was kind of cool that
00:40 - you can use the word papaya Whip and
00:43 - your browser knows that's a color that's
00:45 - just a built-in color papaya whip now
00:48 - besides running a command right here we
00:50 - can also call a function from our other
00:53 - JavaScript code so if we have the
00:56 - onclick event we can call change color
01:00 - and then pass in this that means we're
01:03 - passing in this H1 tab we're passing in
01:05 - this whole thing here to the change
01:08 - color function so over in the JavaScript
01:11 - section we're going to put this change
01:13 - color function it's going to take an
01:16 - object and then we're going to do
01:18 - object. style. color equals Peru because
01:22 - Peru is not just a country it's a color
01:24 - also at least according to your browser
01:26 - so I've reset this if I click here it's
01:29 - now change to the color Peru now on
01:32 - these two we set the onclick event right
01:34 - in the HTML however you can also set the
01:37 - onclick event in the JavaScript so
01:40 - here's a button here and there's nothing
01:42 - in this button that shows what happens
01:44 - when you click the button but over in
01:46 - the JavaScript I'm going to put in some
01:48 - code here first we're going to get the
01:50 - element document. get element by ID my
01:53 - button that's this button over here and
01:56 - then we're going to set an onclick event
01:58 - right in the JavaScript and the event is
02:00 - set to change background color to medium
02:02 - Orchid now this is just a function call
02:05 - that we now have to create okay here's
02:07 - the function function change background
02:09 - color to medium Orchid and we're going
02:11 - to do document. query selector body so
02:15 - that's going to apply to the whole body
02:18 - of the HTML and we're going to set the
02:21 - style. background to medium Orchid
02:25 - medium Orchid is another color in your
02:27 - browser so if I click the button here
02:29 - it's medium Orchid for the background so
02:32 - that's how you can change the background
02:33 - of your whole page besides on click you
02:35 - can also use on load or on unload so
02:40 - that would be something like this you
02:41 - would normally put it on your body tag
02:43 - which would be at the beginning and cod
02:45 - pen you don't use a body tag but if you
02:48 - put an onload event on your body and you
02:51 - run a function here uh these events are
02:54 - often triggered when the user enters or
02:57 - leaves the page and they often are used
02:59 - to deal with with cookies when you're
03:01 - just using the onload and on unload but
03:03 - we're not going to use this right now so
03:05 - another thing I wanted to show you is on
03:08 - input let's bring this down a little bit
03:11 - on input means whenever you input any
03:13 - characters or anything it's going to
03:15 - call a function here so here we have the
03:18 - text box down here and now every time I
03:21 - put in any letter it's calling a
03:22 - function I haven't created the function
03:24 - yet so now it's not doing anything so
03:26 - let's create that function so the
03:28 - function is remove letter from H1 so
03:31 - we're going to set H1 variable to
03:33 - document. query selector H1 that's just
03:35 - going to select the first H1 tag on the
03:38 - HTML page which is this one up here now
03:41 - we're going to find the h1t content
03:44 - that's the text inside the H1 right here
03:47 - what is my favorite food and we're going
03:50 - to set that equal to H1 text content so
03:54 - we're setting equal to itself but then
03:57 - we're slicing it passing in 0ga 1 that
04:00 - means we're just taking off the last
04:01 - letter of that field now this whole
04:04 - function is kind of just for fun just to
04:06 - see what you can do so let's see how it
04:09 - works as you can see every time I type a
04:12 - letter another letter from the H1 tag
04:15 - gets removed also interestingly anytime
04:18 - I delete a letter something is removed
04:20 - too because I'm putting an input of
04:22 - delete and it's still removing
04:24 - letters oh the whole text is gone and
04:27 - let me show you some other events you
04:28 - can do so here I have a div and there's
04:31 - an on Mouse over event that calls this
04:34 - function here and it passes in the div
04:37 - and we have an on Mouse out event that
04:40 - calls the M out function and passes in
04:42 - the div again and we have a class of box
04:45 - so let me put some CSS in here to make
04:47 - it look how we want it to look so dobox
04:50 - just means we're setting the class box
04:52 - to have these things for background
04:54 - we're using the color Rebecca purple so
04:57 - for some reason Rebecca gets her own
04:58 - purple and then the color of the text is
05:02 - light Golden Rod yellow one of the
05:04 - longest text names and we're just going
05:06 - to set the height and the width the font
05:07 - size and some other things so let's see
05:10 - what that looks like and there's the box
05:12 - and right now if we Mouse over and mouse
05:14 - out nothing happens so let's create
05:17 - these JavaScript functions the M over
05:19 - and M out okay here's M over and we're
05:22 - receiving this object that's gets passed
05:24 - into it and we're setting the OBS doin
05:27 - HTML to get off me and then for M out
05:31 - which means Mouse out we're setting the
05:33 - inter HML to thank you smiley face
05:36 - because you can put Emoji in JavaScript
05:38 - code so let's see what happens I'm going
05:40 - to bring my mouse over over oh get off
05:42 - me thank you get off me thank you there
05:46 - are a lot of other events that you can
05:48 - use to trigger JavaScript code check the
05:51 - link in the description to see a list of
05:53 - more events also in the description is a
05:55 - link to the code from this video on code
