01:32 - it apart so yeah awesome well I love
01:35 - playing the bass and uh I was telling
01:37 - you earlier you're like where's the base
01:38 - and I was like oh I don't want to like
01:40 - have to record 10 times right in front
01:42 - of you like when I screw up like my
01:43 - baselines so I just kind of record them
01:46 - separately but yeah let's go all the way
01:49 - back like I always like to start like
01:51 - the the origin story who is John smga
01:54 - how did he come about so you were living
01:56 - in uh ltia and the
02:00 - 1980s of course uh people who aren't as
02:03 - familiar with with uh geography that's
02:06 - like over in kind of like the the
02:07 - eastern part of Europe like there I
02:10 - think there's Lithuania then lvia then
02:12 - Estonia and they're all Baltic states
02:14 - yeah yeah and they're all pressed up
02:16 - against Russia of course yes um yeah
02:19 - they're tiny uh just to give like kind
02:22 - of context especially for people in the
02:24 - United States so essentially you got
02:26 - West Virginia so we're the size of West
02:28 - Virginia and then as far population we
02:30 - are like
02:32 - Nebraska so yeah just just to give
02:35 - context I'm not sure which other country
02:38 - in the world we can compare to but yeah
02:39 - it's it's pretty tiny we are like small
02:42 - it's it's but yeah it's it's it's it's
02:44 - awesome it's an awesome Place yeah maybe
02:47 - you could talk about what it was like
02:48 - being a kid over there cuz like this was
02:51 - uh before you know the Berlin Wall fell
02:54 - you you were born in I think you
02:55 - mentioned 1982 so like just a couple
02:57 - years after I was Bor I was born in 1980
03:00 - uh what was your early childhood like so
03:03 - it was pretty typical for that time like
03:05 - my both my parents were like working
03:08 - they were like called like middle class
03:11 - at that point my father was an engineer
03:13 - my my mom uh also worked in that field
03:16 - and essentially we we were big family we
03:19 - were like five kids so it was the case
03:22 - where essentially Grandma for the most
03:24 - part like raised this like she's like
03:26 - she just did every like everything
03:28 - starting with the cooking cleaning you
03:29 - know taking to the school back and all
03:31 - that but as far as like the the the
03:33 - early memories I don't I don't remember
03:36 - like let's per se like the a lot of
03:38 - things as much I do remember essentially
03:41 - when we gained the freedom that day I do
03:43 - remember watching it on TV and stuff but
03:45 - like I think most vividly as far as just
03:48 - the difference between like for example
03:50 - as I was growing up and my kids I do see
03:52 - that like for example for us when we
03:55 - were growing up I wouldn't say that we
03:56 - were poor it's just there were no things
03:59 - in a store like essentially there's
04:01 - nothing in the store so I do remember
04:03 - vividly how I first time like for
04:04 - example I got the ham like Mom literally
04:07 - brought back the ham right and now I'm
04:08 - seeing at my kids like who essentially
04:10 - can eat in breakfast you know oh I'm
04:12 - just going to pick from one of these
04:13 - five like cereals and whatever yeah and
04:16 - and I'm not saying this as as if like oh
04:18 - you should have like I'm just like
04:20 - giving you like like the perspective it
04:22 - is always like this thing when my mind
04:24 - I'm like wow like how how far like we
04:26 - have come and everything but yeah yeah
04:29 - it was it was it was a lot of fun I mean
04:31 - I do remember just like playing a lot
04:33 - outside and stuff and and and those
04:35 - those those type of things but yeah
04:37 - there was there was definitely scarcity
04:39 - of things just because again not because
04:41 - of like any kind of uh it's just there
04:44 - was no like like no things in the store
04:47 - and stuff like that so like your choices
04:50 - were super limited you had like one pair
04:52 - of boots that you can have and stuff
04:53 - like that yeah I think like back in the
04:57 - day like uh I'm not a historian so I to
05:00 - speak on matters of history please let
05:02 - me know but I remember like one of the
05:04 - things that like the US like used as
05:06 - kind of like a propaganda Point like uh
05:09 - I think they they would like show on
05:12 - like uh Soviet TV like what's the
05:14 - grocery store like in the United States
05:16 - and it was just like tons of different
05:18 - varieties and stuff like that and you
05:20 - know because uh in the Soviet Union they
05:23 - had a lot of price controls in place and
05:25 - they had kind of centralized planning
05:27 - and just not as much stuff got made and
05:29 - distributed even if you had the money to
05:31 - buy things there weren't things to
05:32 - necessarily buy um and and I remember
05:35 - that uh being like really interesting
05:38 - kind of and I'm I'm really grateful
05:41 - obviously the situation changed and you
05:43 - know Lafia is now a much nicer place I
05:45 - would imagine but maybe you could talk
05:47 - about the situation like uh and and just
05:50 - I want to preface this before we get
05:52 - into anything this is not a politics
05:54 - podcast this is not a current events uh
05:56 - podcast we are merely like talking about
05:59 - like history and kind of reflecting on
06:00 - it from our own personal perspective and
06:02 - and stuff like that you don't you don't
06:03 - have to you're not going to hear any
06:05 - fiery di dbes from me about like you
06:08 - know communism is bad or anything like
06:10 - that uh rather I'm just trying to like
06:13 - kind of put some some color on uh the
06:16 - time that you spent over there before
06:19 - you came to the US no it's it's not like
06:22 - the stuff and everything but there is
06:23 - something about the fact that you can
06:25 - make your own decisions instead of all
06:27 - the time being told you know what you
06:29 - need to think what you need to like what
06:30 - is good what is bad and and that sort of
06:32 - thing and I mean as far as ltia it's
06:35 - definitely as I especially I was as I
06:37 - was growing up it was a pain painful
06:39 - process of moving from one system to
06:41 - another one it's not like yes you get
06:43 - your freedom in one day but you need to
06:45 - understand that like there is a
06:46 - difference when I come to the United
06:48 - States I see people who have been free
06:51 - their entire life they know like what is
06:52 - actually freedom of speech that they can
06:54 - say stuff it doesn't happen overnight
06:56 - yes you do like you have like
06:58 - essentially the the structure in place
07:00 - but it takes a long time for the system
07:03 - to change right it can be the the most
07:05 - basic thing like the way I always look
07:07 - at like whether the how the country has
07:10 - developed like what uh like what is the
07:12 - service industry right every year like
07:15 - as I'm going back to laia I see that you
07:17 - know every time it changes it started
07:19 - with basically when you come in and you
07:20 - need to apologize the fact that you
07:22 - entered the store to the point of like
07:24 - now like it's growing and it's
07:26 - developing and it just takes a long time
07:29 - but
07:30 - it's Yeah the more I live I do see the
07:33 - kind of this point of like that the free
07:35 - markets at the end of the day like
07:36 - they're not ideal situation like again
07:38 - we can get into tons of stuff especially
07:41 - like you know the healthc carees and all
07:43 - that but I I just don't see you know
07:46 - just few people in the government
07:48 - running everything and that being
07:49 - successful I I haven't like seen that so
07:52 - yeah well what was school like uh you
07:57 - you went to high school did you go to
07:59 - university
08:00 - in so like in school like it was one of
08:03 - those things this is just a side note
08:05 - but I went to the musically inclined
08:07 - school because my sister was going my
08:08 - older one and my mom thought that it's a
08:10 - good decision to send me there as well
08:13 - so but unlike my sister I couldn't stand
08:15 - it so I had to sing in a choir like you
08:17 - had like I believe like every day we had
08:20 - like music class you had to play an
08:21 - instrument and I just didn't like it I
08:23 - just didn't like it and and I have to
08:25 - say like in high school I was horrible
08:27 - in the sense that I was just late I
08:29 - wasn't doing homework I was not
08:31 - technically inclined I just I just I'm
08:34 - not like if someone asked me what I was
08:36 - doing I don't even remember but I know
08:38 - that I was like pretty bad at school so
08:40 - I wasn't really interested and at some
08:42 - point like towards the last year I just
08:45 - kind of decided Hey listen you know um
08:48 - I'm going to go somewhere else and in a
08:50 - sense like I could have stayed in laia
08:52 - there was no issues and whatsoever you
08:54 - know it's like it wasn't like I had to
08:56 - leave but I just had this idea in my
08:58 - head so I was like you know what I'm
09:00 - just going to go somewhere in Europe or
09:02 - United States just you know I just want
09:04 - to see see the world essentially right
09:07 - because it was one of those things where
09:09 - half of my class were going for law
09:10 - degree and half of my class were going
09:12 - for economics so at that point it was
09:14 - those like two popular choices I I I I
09:17 - believe I just read that right now it's
09:19 - the the the the the social
09:21 - Communications is the thing like so
09:23 - essentially once the class graduates
09:24 - everybody goes into social
09:26 - Communications and things like that so
09:28 - and I was like listen and I don't want
09:30 - to do either of them and and so it was
09:32 - the case where I think I stayed for one
09:34 - or two years and I believe back then we
09:36 - still had uh we need to go to Army so it
09:39 - was like so I still I had to be in
09:41 - school so I remember I believe I went to
09:44 - like some very like strange degree for
09:47 - like one day essentially I showed up the
09:49 - first day then I got the full year off
09:51 - and and everything and then I did the
09:53 - same the the next year what were you
09:56 - doing during this period like did you
09:58 - did you serve in the L in army or no no
10:01 - no no no so so it was one of those
10:02 - things where I was like super bad in
10:05 - school again I cannot explain why but
10:07 - like one of the benefits for me was that
10:10 - my father is like and my mom of course
10:13 - as well but my my dad is like very like
10:16 - he's big on working so essentially my
10:19 - entire life I I had this example of like
10:22 - how you're supposed to treat work so
10:24 - essentially if you're doing something
10:25 - you're doing it if you're not okay just
10:28 - pick something else but if you commit to
10:30 - something it's like like for him like 40
10:33 - hours when he hears 40 hours he usually
10:35 - laughs like for him it's kind of like
10:37 - again we can get into different topic
10:39 - where essentially I think that family is
10:41 - super important so I'm and that kind of
10:43 - helped me because when I when I went to
10:45 - England right after that for two years I
10:48 - worked in a hotel and I was a bartender
10:51 - there so that was kind of it really
10:53 - helped me what I did in laia to kind of
10:55 - transfer that to interesting so you kind
10:56 - of got like into managerial and like uh
11:00 - Hospitality management kind of yeah
11:02 - because like I mean we had to experience
11:04 - this whole thing so I I would say that I
11:07 - entered the workforce pretty quickly and
11:09 - the reason why I attended those few
11:11 - classes here and there is simply to back
11:13 - then like this is one of the decisions
11:15 - that I do regret but then I was
11:17 - basically avoiding military because I
11:19 - just now I'm looking at it differently
11:21 - but back then I just well back thenu me
11:24 - yeah so you said you you spent a year in
11:27 - England that's pretty cool
11:30 - how how were you able to get over to
11:31 - England like was uh they they they just
11:35 - opened
11:36 - essentially 2004 laia entered uh the
11:42 - European Union so there were specific
11:44 - countries which were you could go so
11:46 - this was before brexit obviously so you
11:49 - could just freely like go work in other
11:51 - European countries you you can go and
11:53 - work and and you were I mean again it's
11:55 - one of those things where I A lot of
11:57 - times where I have a little bit of push
11:59 - back where people say like that you know
12:01 - essentially what I always say is to
12:04 - people like there was never a work in
12:05 - England or anywhere else that I would
12:08 - have had if if let's say someone who was
12:10 - born there was willing to do it so
12:12 - essentially it's one of those things
12:13 - where yeah I understand that some people
12:16 - sometimes are not happy about the
12:17 - immigration and I clearly understand
12:19 - that there not needs to be controlled
12:21 - like how it happens but at the same time
12:23 - you know again all all the jobs that I
12:25 - was doing essentially if some somebody
12:27 - like who's speaking English and what
12:29 - ever he would have taken that job
12:30 - effectively immediately I would have you
12:33 - know been fired and all that so uh it
12:35 - was an awesome experience yeah you
12:37 - started off it was it was a little bit
12:39 - rough in in England in that hotel simply
12:42 - because like it was like the Ling
12:43 - quarters as well in the same place so
12:47 - imagine like you know three four people
12:49 - like living in that kind of a dorm room
12:51 - right but it's for like adults and
12:53 - everything else so it was interesting in
12:55 - the beginning but it helped me really to
12:57 - learn English this is where I noticed
12:58 - that
12:59 - you can practice the language all you
13:01 - want I believe in laia I was I was
13:03 - already since I knew that I'm going to
13:04 - be leaving to West I was taking like
13:07 - private I was I hired private teacher
13:09 - and I was like spending my own money to
13:10 - learn language and all that but then
13:12 - once you go to England I realize that I
13:14 - actually don't know that much and the
13:16 - only way how to learn that is just to
13:18 - engage and I've kind of taken this
13:20 - approach with pretty much everything
13:22 - after that right whether that's music
13:24 - Jiu-Jitsu I don't know shooting
13:26 - basketball learning code I mean you can
13:28 - learn the you can read about it watch
13:31 - the videos all day long there's nothing
13:34 - like the moment you touch the keyboard
13:36 - that's the like the the real learning it
13:38 - it's like it's it's just far superior to
13:41 - whatever you you you you can read before
13:44 - that or or once you step on a Jiu-Jitsu
13:47 - mat like then you can watch very real
13:50 - very quickly I would imagine very
13:51 - quickly you understand like like what
13:53 - does that mean and that's why I always
13:56 - like try to kind of combined like
14:00 - learning something but then you always
14:01 - need to have a practice for example like
14:03 - speaking with my kids I'm like I A lot
14:05 - of times I'm like I understand that
14:07 - there's a need to learn like some third
14:08 - language but at the same time if you're
14:10 - not going to use it everyone I've talked
14:12 - to who have like been studying language
14:15 - let's say you know in school or whatever
14:17 - but they haven't used it by that time
14:19 - they it's it's no real use so yeah
14:23 - that's yeah well like I'm excited to get
14:26 - into you know kids and how you're how
14:28 - you're teaching a lot of these things
14:30 - that you learned firsthand from your
14:33 - time for example in England uh but but
14:35 - just keeping with the chronology of
14:37 - events So you you're you've learned
14:40 - English reasonably well uh probably not
14:43 - nearly as well as you speak now you
14:44 - basically sound like a native speaker
14:46 - you just have a little bit of an accent
14:48 - um but like what happened from there
14:51 - like you said it was kind of rough
14:53 - working this job that you know so many
14:55 - jobs that are worked by immigrants uh in
14:58 - the United States for example exle are
14:59 - the kind of thankless jobs that most
15:01 - native born Americans would not be
15:03 - willing to do uh strawberry farming is
15:06 - back breaking work and we have a huge
15:08 - influx of immigrants from other
15:10 - countries some legal some illegal who do
15:13 - the Strawberry Picking and basically
15:15 - make the strawberry you know that you
15:17 - get at the grocery store economically
15:19 - viable and make it not cost like 10
15:21 - bucks instead of cost like three bucks
15:23 - or something I I Haven must Rob in a
15:24 - while so I apologize for like way off
15:27 - but um yeah like that is they had this
15:29 - campaign like take our jobs and they
15:31 - basically said like any American who
15:32 - wants a job picking strawberries can
15:34 - come out here and we'll give you you
15:35 - know the same wages that we give the uh
15:38 - the immigrants from Latin America uh and
15:42 - very few people took them up on that and
15:44 - almost everybody who took them up on it
15:45 - like ultimately like ditched the
15:48 - job because it's backbreaking work and
15:52 - if you look at like the US population
15:53 - sorry I said I wasn't going to talk
15:55 - about politics or current events but but
15:56 - immigration is near and dear to my heart
15:58 - I care a great about uh America and I
16:00 - care about its future and it's future is
16:03 - with immigrants our population would be
16:05 - declining like Japan like Korea like
16:08 - like most European countries if it
16:10 - weren't thanks to new immigrants coming
16:12 - and starting families here like you and
16:15 - your wife have uh you know my wife is a
16:18 - naturalized US citizen which I I I know
16:21 - I mentioned like practically every
16:22 - episode but like we met in grad school
16:25 - uh she moved to the US she worked in
16:27 - tech for many years uh as as an
16:29 - accountant doing other things and you
16:32 - know she has been a productive member of
16:35 - the United States of America and pay
16:37 - taxes and everything like that and this
16:39 - is like the way forward like people who
16:43 - think that we can continue to grow
16:44 - without immigration are dreaming because
16:46 - as countries become prosperous they
16:48 - generally slow down and have fewer kids
16:50 - I've got two kids you've got two kids I
16:52 - don't know you're probably not planning
16:53 - on having five kids like your parents
16:55 - right no I had naive I had this na dream
16:59 - when I was like I don't know 20 or
17:01 - something I thought oh yeah we we were
17:03 - five so that reality hit me quickly I do
17:07 - know people who do that but they don't
17:09 - get a lot of sleep yeah Power to you if
17:11 - you want to have five kids I had two and
17:14 - then I had the uh the surgery so that I
17:16 - can't accidentally have more and I do
17:18 - not regret having the surgery any day I
17:21 - did that surgery I believe it was
17:23 - scheduled right away after my my my
17:25 - second born and then I did I think month
17:27 - after that or something
17:29 - yeah so anyway I just wanted to like get
17:32 - that out there like uh I'm not going to
17:34 - come out in favor of like different
17:36 - policies or anything like that but I
17:38 - will say that I fundamentally believe
17:40 - that having skilled immigrants coming to
17:43 - our country is a profoundly positive
17:45 - thing for everybody for the immigrants
17:47 - for the native born Americans uh for
17:50 - everybody so um yeah so so you're kind
17:54 - of preaching to the choir when you when
17:56 - you when you say that sorry back
17:59 - yeah yeah no no it was because like when
18:01 - I was there I again I wouldn't say there
18:04 - was like I wouldn't say that any anyone
18:06 - was mean to you or anything like that
18:07 - but again the reality of like working
18:09 - somewhere that it's not just you know
18:11 - sunshines and rainbows you that's
18:13 - essentially that's the work you do you
18:15 - go over there and and and and again if
18:18 - if if anyone would show up and take that
18:20 - job then that wouldn't be the case even
18:22 - you know there there's a reason why that
18:23 - company is doing it there's a reason why
18:25 - you're doing it and there's a reason why
18:27 - people who consume that what ever uh
18:29 - product are essentially buying it
18:31 - because it's cheaper essentially at the
18:33 - end of the day right if we really like
18:35 - you know kind of narrow it down to kind
18:37 - of uh the the basics and all that yeah
18:39 - and so I spent two years there I was
18:41 - essentially it was one of those
18:43 - interesting things where I was it's kind
18:45 - of an island in between the England and
18:47 - the the France it's called gery uh it's
18:51 - super interesting it's actually one of
18:52 - the I think one of the only places which
18:54 - were captured by the German and
18:57 - essentially England uh well smartly
19:01 - refus yeah they they they refused to
19:05 - essentially go back and and and kind of
19:07 - fight for it because they effectively
19:08 - they realized that they're just going to
19:10 - be slaughtered over there because it's
19:11 - an island in the middle of the sea in
19:13 - between and and they were like okay you
19:15 - know what we we still need to defend uh
19:17 - the England and the locals they they
19:20 - don't even call themselves that they're
19:21 - like English they say that I'm from gery
19:23 - and uh they say that essentially that
19:26 - they they have never forgotten that that
19:27 - the fact that that that that happened
19:29 - but I think it's one of those things
19:31 - where I think and uh you know like
19:34 - everything closes at like 700 in the
19:35 - evening and stuff like that and it's
19:37 - just like a I'm like 20 something years
19:39 - old I do want to like go and see
19:41 - something yeah not like the greatest
19:44 - place to like spend your 20s I would
19:46 - imagine no no no no no yeah total
19:49 - population 60,000 people um which is you
19:52 - know not yeah it's pretty decent but the
19:55 - funny thing is that uh they they have
19:57 - bunch of like again the same thing like
19:59 - you just mentioned Farms where they grow
20:01 - I believe roses and vegetables and all
20:03 - that and that was that job was even out
20:06 - say even like essentially you need to
20:08 - work longer hours and that sort of thing
20:10 - than the let's say the hotel where I was
20:13 - working and um yeah there was a lot of
20:16 - Lans employed so from the 60,000 there
20:19 - was like 5,000 Lans at the time when I
20:22 - was there so it was interesting where
20:23 - you go it is interesting so like did is
20:26 - the laan overseas gasp or like have they
20:29 - specialized in kind of like that that
20:32 - Services sector type thing like uh
20:35 - because I have lots of friend from India
20:38 - that live in like UAE or live in uh
20:41 - bahin or places like that and it's like
20:44 - a whole lot of Indian engineers and
20:46 - people like that work in these countries
20:48 - or the Philippines for example uh a huge
20:51 - percentage of the world's sailers are
20:53 - from the Philippines and it's kind of
20:54 - like they specialized and nurses yeah my
20:57 - my wife was like when she was working as
20:59 - a nurse there was like tons of you
21:02 - nurses from the Philippines because they
21:03 - have very good programs and essentially
21:05 - that's one of the things how
21:07 - they I mean I don't want to sound like
21:10 - like mean but kind of their export is
21:12 - the PE the fact that people go and work
21:14 - abroad and they send the money back
21:16 - remittances huge portion of their GDP is
21:20 - from uh workers abroad sending money
21:22 - back same thing with like India uh it
21:25 - was definitely like that with China for
21:26 - a long time uh maybe you could talk a
21:29 - little bit about though like you said
21:31 - there were 5,000 LA on this island at
21:35 - that time yeah so so you was it
21:38 - challenging to actually speak English
21:40 - all the time when you had so many other
21:41 - people that were probably like wanting
21:43 - to talk to their countrymen did you have
21:44 - like lvan you know restaurants and stuff
21:47 - like that as far as the the restaurants
21:49 - at that time no but there was like as
21:51 - far as communication yeah between
21:53 - yourself you were always talking latian
21:55 - so it was one of those things where
21:57 - essentially you needed to immerse
21:58 - yourself you need to find the ways how
22:01 - you can just talk to English people for
22:04 - me it was pretty easy because I was
22:05 - working in a bar so all the everyone who
22:07 - was coming there was speaking English so
22:09 - essentially I was just like uh being
22:12 - annoying and trying to come up with any
22:14 - kind of topic talking about sports all
22:15 - day and stuff like that just to get like
22:18 - basically the practice practice in and
22:21 - as far as your question about uh what
22:24 - type of work it was one of those things
22:26 - where back then and it's still the case
22:28 - right now in ltia where essentially like
22:31 - the capital is doing really well that's
22:33 - where I'm from Ria but then everything
22:35 - else is like I mean
22:37 - again better or worse but a lot of
22:41 - people like move from the outskirts from
22:45 - from smaller like places and for them
22:47 - yeah it's mostly initially at least
22:50 - they're they're going for for
22:52 - hospitality jobs and stuff like
22:54 - essentially what you can do without any
22:56 - kind of like specialized education now
22:59 - with the years since they have spent a
23:00 - lot of time especially like for example
23:02 - in Ireland I think we even have a bigger
23:05 - diaspora than the than the England they
23:08 - you know open up their own companies
23:09 - they they do different they you know go
23:11 - to school study something that that's
23:14 - pretty common actually but initially
23:17 - yeah that's one of those things where I
23:18 - don't know many instances where someone
23:21 - let's say like migrated and they right
23:25 - away start working for some giant
23:26 - company it's definitely the case of
23:28 - course but I personally don't know them
23:30 - you always start from some kind of job
23:31 - that you can actually uh perform and
23:35 - where there's a need and and and such a
23:38 - skilled jobs are way more protected so
23:40 - you need to show showcase way more
23:43 - qualifications and and essentially
23:45 - networking and all that yeah so you came
23:47 - to the US did you when did you move to
23:50 - the US was that directly from gury or
23:53 - yeah yeah pretty much I I I kind of
23:55 - decided that listen it's kind of like I
23:57 - saved up some money I was I was working
23:59 - there at two jobs uh eventually and I
24:02 - was able to save up some money which was
24:04 - for 20 year old was like I thought it
24:07 - it's a big success and uh yeah
24:09 - effectively I I just basically got the I
24:13 - thought you know what I'm just going to
24:14 - go and travel us you know and just just
24:17 - see what it's like end up in Chicago uh
24:20 - end up meeting my wife uh pretty early
24:23 - on and effectively just getting together
24:26 - and then that's one of those things
24:28 - where that wasn't my intention at all
24:31 - and then next thing you know I'm I'm I'm
24:33 - in there and W so things just solidified
24:36 - very quickly your wife uh you could talk
24:39 - a little bit about your your wife uh a
24:41 - nurse from Ukraine um maybe you can talk
24:45 - just a little bit about her background
24:47 - and what her life had been like up to
24:49 - the point that you two met in Chicago so
24:52 - she came also like she was like very
24:54 - like very early on she like she's
24:57 - actually the opposite that she in
24:58 - Ukraine she did really well in studies
25:01 - she was actually going for uh she was
25:04 - going for um engineering but then at
25:08 - some point uh she decided that listen I
25:11 - want to spend like a little bit of time
25:13 - in us so I'm just going to go and
25:15 - there's a program called opair where
25:17 - essentially you come here and you are
25:19 - nanny for whatever time and then while
25:21 - she was here she kind of was was
25:23 - researching stuff and she she saw that
25:25 - there's basically there were programs as
25:27 - far as nurses so if you stay here then
25:29 - you get a green card and all that and
25:32 - that effectively she decided to do and
25:34 - uh she started studying to nurse and I
25:36 - already met her when she was uh in there
25:40 - that was kind of our thing and then yeah
25:42 - we're pretty quickly like it was one of
25:44 - those things where I don't want to tell
25:45 - that to my daughters but we pretty
25:47 - quickly we started like we we kind of
25:48 - knew that like this is the right person
25:51 - and everything and I kind of went from
25:53 - there there wasn't much time and and
25:56 - things like so love it first sight or
25:58 - love within you know the first few times
26:01 - of hang that we met and um yeah we
26:04 - realized that we're both sarcastic and
26:07 - yeah like all the time joke and and
26:09 - stuff like that so it was it was it was
26:12 - very quickly oh that so again but it
26:15 - wasn't like the intention my intention
26:17 - essentially like I think I was even
26:18 - talking I was thinking about New Zealand
26:20 - at some point because my idea was like
26:22 - okay I'm going to go travel us and
26:24 - everything but there were more um kind
26:27 - of I had more info on how you
26:30 - effectively can go to New Zealand and
26:32 - work and live there and stuff like and
26:34 - and for some reason I don't ask me why
26:36 - but I thought that New Zealand is the
26:38 - place to be it's a nice place it's a
26:41 - nice place but again if someone is going
26:43 - to ask me why you were thinking like
26:45 - what was the the appeal of New Zealand
26:47 - I'm like I don't know but I just when I
26:48 - was in England I was like I need to go
26:50 - to New Zealand but I'm just going to go
26:51 - to us and like essentially just just
26:54 - just visit the US and see what it's like
26:57 - and yeah yeah well I mean we're we're
26:58 - thrilled that you decided to stay here
27:00 - so yeah it wasn't it it wasn't really
27:02 - like planned and everything and and um
27:06 - yeah and then we met uh we uh she was
27:10 - already in school but I was essentially
27:12 - working um like I mean again I don't
27:15 - want to call them dead end jobs you can
27:17 - essentially make the career out of it
27:19 - but for me it was definitely the case
27:20 - where like as I was working because like
27:23 - in here one of the things when you come
27:25 - and you have no education whatsoever you
27:27 - like most likely you'll work in
27:29 - construction and that's for whether it's
27:31 - an immigrant whether that's like person
27:33 - who's born here it's one of especially
27:35 - for male that's Especial like one of the
27:38 - most popular places to end up is
27:39 - construction because there's always some
27:41 - building going on and you know you can
27:44 - learn the the the the job from from the
27:46 - scratch you just walk in there and
27:48 - you're like say okay listen you know you
27:50 - start from the very bottom and then you
27:52 - you know uh keep going and did you ever
27:55 - work construction yeah yeah I worked for
27:57 - like I want to say after that like for
28:00 - five years because years that's crazy
28:03 - like I just want to stop and say I work
28:05 - construction for one
28:08 - week and then I went back to like Taco
28:11 - Bell or whatever like I just couldn't
28:13 - handle it like it was brutal demolishing
28:16 - buildings and stuff like that like just
28:18 - picking up heavy Jagged things like all
28:21 - day long and your hands just get all
28:23 - calloused up and maybe you could talk
28:26 - about that experience because I I'm not
28:28 - sure how many people listening to this
28:29 - have work construction or appreciate the
28:31 - sheer like it is real work like me
28:35 - sitting at my computer my headphones on
28:38 - cup of tea by my side like it's a very
28:40 - different vibe from like walking around
28:42 - a construction site with a hard hat on
28:43 - it's not going to be just we started we
28:45 - didn't have much like really like we had
28:47 - like small apartment where we were you
28:49 - know just just trying to survive for
28:51 - more or less and we realize that listen
28:54 - you know I need to work otherwise if we
28:56 - both are going to be students then we're
28:57 - going to take in 10,000 in student loans
28:59 - and that's not like it's not going to be
29:01 - sustainable so effectively yeah while
29:03 - she was studying I was all the time
29:05 - working and then effectively we flipped
29:07 - so she started working and then I went
29:09 - to the school uh but
29:12 - construction um it it definitely taught
29:14 - me a lot it's one of those things where
29:17 - it's like you just said uh essentially
29:19 - every time I catch myself that you know
29:22 - if something is hard as a developer I'm
29:25 - like do you remember what it was like
29:28 - you know because uh I used to actually
29:30 - towards the end of it I worked I was
29:32 - working on window as a window installer
29:34 - and that's even more in my opinion like
29:37 - it's a good job in a sense that you can
29:39 - work all year round and everything but
29:41 - it's uh pretty grueling simply because
29:44 - you need to be done with that job in
29:45 - that day because you already have
29:47 - scheduled for next day so for example if
29:49 - I have to install these like six windows
29:51 - I need to finish today it's not the case
29:53 - where I'm like okay I didn't feel like
29:55 - it today or whatever I'm going to show
29:57 - up tomorrow no that's not the case so I
29:59 - remember essentially we were like
30:01 - gathering in the office already 6:00 in
30:03 - the morning so we need to get up at 5:00
30:05 - and if the job takes longer it takes
30:07 - longer so if you're home at 8 you're
30:09 - home at 8 and there's like you're not
30:11 - going to go in and say start complaining
30:13 - the next day that's just the reality of
30:15 - the job so again many benefits as far as
30:17 - you constantly are employed and all that
30:20 - but again there's some drawbacks and
30:22 - that definitely has helped me as far as
30:24 - you know when when when I need to study
30:27 - something or what ever it's much easier
30:29 - to kind of like convince myself that you
30:31 - know listen this is just peanuts
30:33 - compared to what I was doing so you can
30:36 - turn it on and you can push through like
30:38 - procrastination or other psychological
30:40 - blocks that you may encounter because
30:42 - you had to do that all the time as a
30:43 - window installer there was no
30:46 - alternative yeah it's it's one of those
30:48 - things where essentially like I realized
30:50 - that like it's not the case where I can
30:52 - just simply just because I don't like
30:53 - something to quit my job because I do
30:55 - have like my wife is studying so it's
30:57 - not the case where and just be like well
30:59 - today I don't feel like it so I'm just
31:00 - going to quit the the idea was that
31:02 - listen we need to get through this
31:03 - moment we we will do it together and
31:07 - that kind of it has definitely helped me
31:09 - now I'm not saying that I'm some kind of
31:10 - like you know superhero who can listen I
31:13 - still have those days when I'm like I I
31:15 - don't feel like it but I have like
31:16 - worked on on the fact that you trick
31:18 - yourself and worst case scenario you
31:20 - just remind yourself about like like
31:22 - what are potentially what were the
31:25 - options like and the Alternatives yeah
31:28 - and why this is much better so you
31:30 - better like you know get your stuff
31:32 - together amazing yeah well I just
31:35 - keeping with the chronology because
31:36 - there's so many like I'm taking detailed
31:38 - notes as you talk and I've already got
31:40 - like 46 paragraphs of notes which sounds
31:43 - crazy it's actually like 26 because I
31:44 - double space but like I'm going to keep
31:47 - these insights flowing but I also want
31:50 - to get like caught up to like present
31:52 - day so how long were you and your wife
31:56 - together before you decided to to
31:58 - married to to have kids like like what
32:00 - was that span of time like in
32:04 - Chicago before marry that's a good
32:08 - question I would say like I would say
32:12 - like one year something like that so
32:14 - like pretty fast that's about how
32:16 - quickly I married my wife like we were
32:18 - married we were living together
32:19 - literally like you know like a month or
32:22 - two we were we were already like living
32:25 - so yeah and the kid kids were longer
32:28 - because again we had those plans where
32:29 - essentially one is going to finish the
32:31 - school the second is going to finish the
32:33 - school um and then then then we were
32:36 - planning the the family and that
32:37 - effectively that's how it happened
32:39 - actually so mhm yeah so you you planned
32:41 - everything out and everything kind of
32:43 - went according to plan at what point
32:45 - yeah it was oh I'm sorry go ahead no no
32:47 - no no it's actually one of those things
32:49 - that I always laugh about but yeah my my
32:51 - wife is very good at those things and
32:53 - and everything that she planned out
32:54 - actually worked out exactly the same way
32:57 - yeah so yeah sorry a recurring theme on
33:00 - the free Coke Camp podcast people who
33:01 - come on the free C Camp podcast who uh
33:04 - have accomplished enough to like uh I
33:06 - guess weren't coming on here like you
33:09 - they generally have a plan of sorts that
33:12 - and they have the uh the grit I guess
33:14 - the determination to stick to it uh you
33:17 - you talked about how your dad was like a
33:19 - really hard worker and he really prided
33:21 - himself in his work and then you know 5
33:24 - years working construction and just
33:26 - having to get up and dust yourself off
33:29 - and go do it every day right um yeah so
33:32 - it sounds like hard work and planning
33:34 - are like a big part of your success so
33:36 - far um so where do you go from Chicago
33:41 - like your wife eventually finishes
33:43 - nursing school she she worked as a nurse
33:47 - for quite a while yeah yeah she so
33:49 - effectively the way it worked we um uh
33:52 - so we met uh she was already doing that
33:55 - and and I was just like starting looking
33:57 - at the studies for a few reasons because
34:00 - pretty early on I again I was that was
34:02 - already after that one year and a half
34:04 - in in in England and everything and I
34:06 - realized that listen you know there's
34:08 - going to have to be some changes
34:09 - essentially I need to go back to school
34:11 - it's just it it maybe sounds like a
34:14 - great idea to you know not to go to
34:16 - school and again we can get into the
34:18 - whole college and that and all that but
34:22 - I mean depending on where you live in
34:24 - the world I do still think that it's a
34:26 - good idea to go to school
34:28 - and I realized that and I was like yeah
34:30 - but at the moment I cannot do that
34:31 - simply because my wife is already
34:33 - studying so what I was doing uh
34:36 - essentially I started slowly in
34:38 - Community College I was just taking
34:39 - classes you know so I was usually uh I
34:42 - was taking train to work so train was in
34:44 - the morning and then the evening and
34:45 - while I was in the evening I was usually
34:47 - studying uh whether that was getting
34:50 - some notes from the book or just
34:52 - watching some YouTube videos and stuff
34:54 - about like some specific topic not just
34:57 - not just the Beast videos or anything
34:59 - like that yeah well you're probably
35:01 - watching precursors to like John
35:04 - smga yeah yeah yeah and and and so I
35:07 - decided you know what I'm just going to
35:09 - basically follow the footsteps of my dad
35:11 - and I'm just going to go and study to be
35:13 - an engineer and um so I finished the
35:17 - community college and that was the plan
35:20 - but then once I went to school there was
35:22 - like a big overlap between the
35:24 - electrical engineering and computer
35:26 - science and and I was very hesitant
35:29 - because I in my head I had this idea
35:31 - that you only do computer science if
35:33 - you're totally into game games and and
35:35 - if you're into that Tech and you need to
35:37 - be young you know there's no way you can
35:39 - be like whatever you know 30 years or
35:41 - whatever age and then you can study no
35:43 - there's no way yeah whenever you see a
35:45 - Hollywood movie the the engineer is
35:48 - always like some guy in his like 50s and
35:50 - 60s he's got like gray hair and like a
35:52 - big beard and he's like we got to do
35:54 - this and this and this or else this
35:55 - entire ship is going to blow know and
35:58 - then the the computer guy is always some
36:00 - like you know 19-year-old kid who uh has
36:04 - like four social skills that like
36:05 - doesn't have any lived experience but
36:07 - he's really good with computers right
36:08 - those are the stereotypes he was he has
36:09 - been doing that since he was five
36:11 - because no one played with him and yeah
36:13 - all that and this is where free Cod Camp
36:16 - enters because effectively what happened
36:18 - was I had this already inclination
36:20 - because we had some classes and
36:21 - everything and I can see that Cod I
36:23 - really like coding but it was just this
36:25 - mental block in my head where I'm like
36:27 - no you need to do something realistic
36:30 - basically I was telling myself you need
36:31 - to stick with the electrical because you
36:33 - know computer science is not for you you
36:35 - basically you you uh the the ship has
36:37 - sailed and here comes Quincy Larson back
36:40 - then I was watching there's there's
36:43 - still probably YouTube channel called
36:44 - engineering truth and uh and I and I saw
36:47 - you and and you talked as always
36:50 - excitingly about coding about and
36:52 - everything and I'm like I'm watching
36:53 - watching that video and I'm like no I'm
36:56 - I'm I'm doing that
36:58 - and and that was kind of a big flip for
36:59 - me that that I was like ever since I saw
37:02 - you like you have one of those like
37:03 - qualities like the essentially like as
37:06 - Ambassador for you know tech industry is
37:09 - just amazing that you know like instead
37:12 - of this kind of uh what is it called
37:15 - gatekeeping right instead of it's like
37:17 - hey you know come on over and and I I
37:20 - really liked your article which you
37:21 - wrote one time or or you mentioned there
37:24 - that essentially you think of coding as
37:26 - as as as a as for people like when they
37:29 - were learning how to read you know you
37:31 - basically compared and that kind of like
37:34 - like really like made s so much sense to
37:37 - me when I when when when I heard that or
37:39 - or read your quote I'm like yeah that
37:41 - definitely makes sense even if I do end
37:44 - up going let's say to electrical
37:45 - engineering then coding is essentially
37:48 - like reading back in a day you know
37:50 - where you need to understand at least
37:52 - you know the general concepts and all
37:54 - that so yeah yeah definitely the case
37:56 - I'll try to par phrase myself uh
37:58 - essentially I said like you know during
38:02 - the AG Agricultural Revolution it was
38:04 - beneficial to learn how to read because
38:06 - then you could like you know read how to
38:07 - use fertilizer you could read the
38:09 - instructions for like new tractors and
38:10 - other tools and stuff like that and and
38:12 - during the Industrial Revolution as well
38:14 - when cars came out it was beneficial to
38:16 - learn how to drive like that was a huge
38:19 - source of economic value for so many
38:22 - people who were able to work as like
38:24 - truck drivers or taxi drivers or or
38:27 - people that just could live somewhere
38:29 - less expensive and commute using a car
38:31 - right that that became a big thing and
38:33 - when Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel
38:35 - like you know obviously there were like
38:37 - there was vizal and there were word
38:38 - presses before those but when those
38:40 - really got popularized in the 1990s
38:43 - everybody just learned how to use them
38:44 - and they were way more productive for it
38:46 - and I think learning how to use
38:48 - JavaScript is pretty similar learning
38:50 - how to use high level scripting
38:51 - languages right and and now learning how
38:53 - to use llms uh large language models in
38:56 - conjunction with other coding Tools in
38:59 - conjunction with databases things like
39:01 - that like I see them as just new skills
39:04 - that everybody should kind of put in the
39:05 - time to learn and I genuinely do believe
39:07 - that pretty much everybody should learn
39:08 - at least how computers work and if they
39:12 - can write some coding great uh if they
39:14 - can write some code great like I there
39:17 - is no knowledge that is not power right
39:19 - there are no skills that are just
39:21 - useless like you know I'm sure even
39:24 - though you you don't think highly of
39:26 - your musical education Al comes up where
39:28 - you happen to know something that's
39:29 - useful right that's one of those things
39:32 - that no no I even kind of like hold the
39:34 - tone so I I always stay
39:36 - off that's one of I always laugh about
39:39 - that then yeah yeah so so that's like
39:43 - first of all I feel very honored that uh
39:45 - that that interview that I did with I
39:47 - think it's name Mike Mike Tran like uh
39:49 - inuring truth back in the day um yeah
39:52 - you your I think your oldest one was
39:55 - like literally she came into the camera
39:57 - she was like just toddler not a toddler
40:00 - that was like seven years ago probably
40:02 - that was like a long time ago yeah yeah
40:05 - so wow okay so you're like going to
40:09 - Community College you're studying
40:10 - engineering electrical engineering like
40:12 - of course electrical engineering is
40:13 - similar to computer science and in fact
40:16 - it like Berkeley and a lot of other
40:17 - prominent schools that they were like
40:19 - kind of the same joint degree you was
40:21 - studying both can you talk about like
40:23 - what that transition was like like okay
40:25 - I like coding you how did you start
40:27 - coding cing so going a little bit back
40:30 - what I do want to mention like I know
40:32 - that there's I mean let me so
40:34 - essentially sometimes people complain
40:35 - about degrees effectively but one thing
40:37 - I do I can say maybe I'm not using the
40:40 - physics or chemistry or you know
40:43 - calculus or whatever but studying to
40:48 - understand that like reading through
40:49 - those textbooks has definitely help me
40:52 - when I have to go through the docks
40:54 - because it just prepares you where like
40:56 - listen there's a problem you need to
40:57 - solve it and you need to spend hours on
41:01 - just going through stuff and those
41:03 - textbooks can sometimes be even more dry
41:05 - than the docks these days because now
41:07 - everyone does an amazing job on like
41:09 - providing very useful docks and so
41:11 - definitely from my perspective even just
41:13 - for that learning how to learn is just
41:16 - super useful like going to school again
41:19 - we can get into the whole de thing and
41:21 - all that but as far as Community College
41:22 - I don't regret for even one second that
41:25 - you know I was spending those weekends
41:27 - and like evenings or whatever studying
41:30 - and that's that's also one something
41:31 - that it's always funny once you get kids
41:33 - you realize how much actually time you
41:35 - had so if we're talking about like
41:37 - coding as a skill that everyone at least
41:40 - in some kind of shape or form should
41:42 - know it's definitely one of those things
41:43 - where before kids you real you like you
41:45 - don't realize how much time you have on
41:47 - your hands and how much you're just
41:48 - wasting It Away on YouTube videos and
41:50 - whatever and then the moment you get the
41:53 - kids you realize oh okay I actually had
41:55 - all this time where I could have done
41:56 - something right yeah even though it
41:58 - sounds kind of like well yeah everyone
41:59 - should know the code but it's you don't
42:01 - need like to spend that much time in or
42:04 - at least understand the general concepts
42:05 - of how internet works and and and things
42:08 - like that nature yeah and yeah the the
42:11 - the transition was pretty like I it was
42:14 - again happened was kind of out of my
42:17 - control effectively like I made that
42:19 - decision that yeah I'm going to be you
42:20 - know essentially transferring from one
42:22 - degree to another one but at that time
42:24 - already my wife uh got the job offer in
42:27 - California and it was like a no-brainer
42:30 - uh because we we went for a road trip
42:32 - before that for for like month or so we
42:35 - drove all the way from Chicago to San
42:37 - Diego and back through through the
42:39 - through the United States and we were
42:42 - like okay we're moving to California but
42:44 - in order for me to transfer my credits
42:46 - it was essentially I looked at it that I
42:48 - need to start from the scratch in
42:49 - California and I was like well there has
42:51 - to be a better way and here again free C
42:54 - Camp comes into to comes into the
42:56 - picture because I read Bo's article
42:59 - about the WGU how he essentially
43:01 - finished yeah everybody like you
43:04 - probably seen him but you may not know
43:06 - his name is pronounced Bo it's not
43:08 - pronounced bu or it's like a French name
43:11 - it's just pronounced like Bo like a b
43:12 - staff and uh he he's the gentleman that
43:16 - you see doing the intros on all the free
43:17 - C Camp courses including I think most of
43:19 - your courses he does a quick intro so
43:22 - yes please continue I just wanted to
43:24 - provide some context yeah and so I see
43:27 - the Bose's article where he says how he
43:29 - finished the
43:30 - WGU and I'm like okay this is what I'm
43:32 - going to do since we're now in
43:34 - California I don't want to start from
43:35 - the scratch uh I'm just going to finish
43:37 - WGU I I wasn't as fast as B Because at
43:41 - that point um while I was still in
43:44 - Chicago effectively the moment I
43:46 - realized that I will have to do some
43:48 - coding I already started recording some
43:51 - videos because I noticed that and is and
43:54 - that was one of those things where I'm
43:55 - like you know what I'm going to start
43:56 - releasing those
43:57 - videos in the beginning they were like
43:59 - totally horrible I believe I was like I
44:01 - even started without any sound I just
44:05 - because I have a voice condition so I
44:07 - didn't like how my voice sound you talk
44:09 - about your voice condition like for me
44:10 - it's incredibly distinct uh because you
44:14 - you hear people like uh the lady on NPR
44:16 - I'm trying to remember her name uh but
44:19 - she has like a a voice condition but the
44:21 - result is the moment you tune to NPR and
44:23 - you hear her voice you're like I know
44:25 - exactly who that is and I know this is
44:26 - going to be a a dynamite interview it's
44:28 - going to be so good because she's so
44:30 - skilled uh at interviewing so you have
44:33 - some form of like paralysis one of your
44:35 - vocal codes yeah one of my vocal codes
44:37 - is essentially paralyzed I only like
44:40 - started working on that actually like
44:42 - only a few years ago and because I went
44:44 - to the doctors and they're like well
44:46 - technically there's nothing like it's
44:48 - sort of permanent no one knows why it
44:50 - happened and how I always blame the
44:52 - music as I not the the music's cool of
44:54 - course it's not but I'm just joking
44:56 - about that but um that was one of the
44:59 - things where um I do need to get like
45:03 - certain injections because otherwise
45:04 - they're not closing properly and it's
45:07 - it's a lot of times like for example
45:09 - when I'm recording it's kind of like it
45:11 - literally can be sometimes hard for me
45:12 - to speak so it really depends if I get
45:14 - the injection so now I got my last
45:16 - injection like 3 months ago so that's
45:18 - when you sent the invite I'm like okay
45:20 - now it's a perfect time if that would be
45:22 - in like let's say January I literally
45:23 - there was a time when I couldn't like
45:25 - even talk and
45:27 - uh yeah it's one of those things where
45:30 - that's why my voice uh like there is a
45:33 - like sometimes people complain like Hey
45:35 - listen what happened to your previous
45:36 - voice and all that and they either think
45:38 - that it's that I'm sick or something but
45:40 - it's not really the case it's it's
45:41 - literally it can change depending on the
45:43 - injection depending on the surgery it's
45:45 - one of those things where I constantly
45:47 - need to do something otherwise uh
45:49 - especially since I'm recording and using
45:51 - my voice so much it's it's it kind of I
45:54 - mean goes bad pretty quickly yeah kind
45:57 - kind of that way so yeah so what happens
45:59 - when it goes bad like I Diane ree is the
46:02 - name of the lady I was talking about
46:04 - from NPR who recently retired uh epic
46:08 - legendary interviewer host of what was
46:11 - it all things considered I can't
46:12 - remember the name of the uh the show but
46:15 - I think she eventually had like the Dian
46:17 - ream show or something like that but um
46:19 - but she had like a neurological thing uh
46:22 - so it wasn't actually mechanically
46:24 - something with the vocal cord so you you
46:25 - have an actual condition with it's
46:27 - mechanical yeah and essentially for me
46:28 - it comes down to that I can speak for
46:30 - like 2 minutes and then I have to cough
46:33 - it it's kind of like one of those things
46:34 - where so imagine like recording a
46:36 - 10minute video right where not only you
46:38 - mess up when essentially you do some
46:40 - coding mistakes but you also you talk
46:42 - and then it just cracks up the voice and
46:43 - you need to clear the throat and and
46:45 - that kind of is my you know it goes from
46:48 - The Voice is good and then slowly slowly
46:50 - it deteriorates again because again you
46:52 - cannot really fully like make them close
46:55 - because one of them is paralyzed so you
46:56 - can only do it like temporarily like
46:59 - just fix it and then again it goes bad
47:02 - okay so yeah yeah well well that
47:05 - combined with your lvan accent I think
47:07 - explains why you sound so distinctive
47:10 - and why your voice is instantly
47:12 - recognizable to anybody who's like
47:13 - learning the code they've probably heard
47:15 - your voice and I wouldn't be surprised
47:16 - if they were like oh wait I know who
47:17 - that is even though I didn't remember
47:19 - his name I think I've heard his voice
47:20 - before right yeah yeah it's definitely
47:22 - one of those cases
47:24 - yeah and I'm sorry just just to
47:27 - encourage anyone who's like like non
47:30 - English speaking uh effectively if
47:32 - you're thinking about doing videos you
47:33 - should because it's one of those things
47:35 - that I didn't realize where essentially
47:37 - I was always like yeah I'm I'm not a fan
47:39 - that I cannot get rid of the accent it's
47:41 - always going to be there with the at the
47:44 - same time there is a benefit there's
47:46 - many people who are non-english speakers
47:48 - maybe my vocabulary is not as you know
47:50 - wide as someone else's yeah and you can
47:53 - use some simple terms and in in some
47:55 - sort of accent and stuff so if you are a
47:57 - non-english speaker you definitely
47:59 - should do it you know just because you
48:01 - don't know how many people actually will
48:04 - resonate with your voice with your
48:06 - accent and all that so yeah yeah I'll
48:09 - I'll do give a very quick anecdote
48:12 - personally uh when I lived in China like
48:15 - right after I started graduate school
48:17 - graduate school I moved to China and I
48:19 - lived there like for like five or six
48:21 - years uh basically waiting for my wife
48:24 - to be able to get like uh a green to be
48:27 - able to come to the US um and when I was
48:30 - doing my intensive Mandarin program uh I
48:33 - wasn't talking with a lot of native
48:35 - Chinese speakers there were like the you
48:37 - know the teachers all the classes were
48:38 - in Chinese and everything like that I
48:39 - was the only guo on campus or the only
48:42 - guor in well was like the rude kind of
48:45 - Cantonese way I'm saying it because it
48:47 - sounds like ghost but uh I was the only
48:49 - uh wior in or wo poo the the foreign
48:52 - friend I'm sorry I have to say I always
48:54 - find these the when when someone like
48:57 - like when they have those terms for for
48:59 - white people somewhere else I just find
49:00 - them super funny I don't know why every
49:02 - time like let's say gringo and all it's
49:04 - just I just crack up every like Sor well
49:07 - I mean like I mean frankly white people
49:09 - are not really disadvantaged anywhere
49:11 - like in China people would give me like
49:13 - they they didn't look at me and say oh
49:14 - this guy's going to speak native like
49:16 - native level Chinese I like some of them
49:18 - would talk very slowly to me which is
49:20 - very kind but the way I learned most of
49:22 - my Chinese was not from Chinese speakers
49:24 - it was from Koreans who stayed in the
49:26 - dormatory with me so my roommate was
49:29 - Korean everybody was Korean and they had
49:30 - all come to China to like learn you know
49:32 - international trade and they as part of
49:34 - that they needed to learn Chinese
49:36 - because China Korea huge trading
49:38 - partners just like the US in China but
49:40 - even more so um so uh yeah so having
49:44 - that experience of just constantly
49:45 - talking to Korean people in Chinese
49:47 - because they couldn't speak English and
49:48 - I couldn't speak Korean like Chinese was
49:51 - our lingual franka and we had that
49:52 - restricted vocabulary and we were just
49:54 - better at like I he he's not using the
49:57 - tone correctly but I I kind of
49:58 - understand what he means like it just
50:00 - builds there's this affordance that is
50:02 - built in when you're talking with a
50:03 - non-native English speaker or in my case
50:06 - a nonnative Chinese speaker and it is
50:08 - dramatically easier so I can I can
50:10 - definitely see the benefit in having
50:12 - people creating tutorials for
50:14 - programming in English that like you
50:17 - yourself are going to probably use a
50:18 - more restricted vocabulary because like
50:21 - I grew up speaking English like I'm
50:22 - going to use all these weird you know
50:23 - Yankee
50:24 - Expressions that that people learn
50:26 - familiar with I'm going to do all these
50:28 - weird American pop culture references
50:30 - and stuff that people that grew up
50:32 - outside the US may not have any idea
50:33 - what that means you know like without
50:35 - thinking right so it it immediately
50:37 - increases the difficulty of
50:39 - comprehending what I'm saying if you're
50:41 - if you've only been studying English for
50:42 - a few years for example so yeah it it is
50:45 - absolutely valuable and I'll just kind
50:47 - of second what you just said John that
50:49 - even if you're not like the best English
50:52 - speaker you should still record
50:54 - tutorials even if you have a voice
50:55 - condition uh record tutorials like it is
50:59 - helpful and and at the very worst you're
51:01 - going to record tutorials that not very
51:03 - many people watch but just the act of
51:04 - teaching something is the best way to
51:05 - solidify your own knowledge and uh
51:08 - teachers often know stuff much better
51:11 - than practitioners it maybe the best
51:13 - combination is of course a teacher
51:15 - practition or somebody who's worked in
51:16 - the field and now teaches it or
51:18 - continues to work in the field and
51:19 - teaches but I digress so John uh so
51:23 - you're in California of course the
51:25 - Golden State did you take Route 66 to
51:27 - get out there uh some parts of it yeah
51:30 - yeah cuz I think it runs from Chicago to
51:32 - Los Angeles yeah I think we deviated in
51:35 - in some places I believe we yeah there
51:38 - we went there twice so one time was for
51:40 - the road trip and second time when we
51:42 - were actually moving we were deviating
51:44 - because we went to um we were in
51:47 - Sacramento at the time so our route was
51:50 - a little bit different and we first time
51:52 - we went through Wyoming we we were not
51:54 - fans of Wyoming simply because was
51:56 - literally one of those things where you
51:58 - drive into Wyoming you have a hail storm
52:00 - and then you drove into Utah and you
52:02 - have Sunny sky and clear and it's it was
52:04 - like just this one of those like like
52:07 - movie moments right so you're literally
52:09 - driving through the hell storm like we
52:10 - got the crack in the windshield and
52:12 - everything and then the moment we drove
52:13 - into Utah the sky is clear and the Sun
52:16 - is like blasting we're like nope no more
52:19 - Wyoming my apology like I hope well I
52:22 - mean he not always like that and you
52:23 - just I hope you didn't get too bad of an
52:25 - impression but Utah has has some amazing
52:27 - natural beauty for sure MH and I I have
52:30 - made the drive to California and back um
52:34 - from Oklahoma City not from uh Chicago
52:37 - so slightly shorter I think but uh yeah
52:40 - like that that's a big Endeavor so you
52:41 - get out to California your wife is now
52:43 - working as a nurse and you
52:46 - are you decided to go to WGU Western
52:49 - Governor's University which is an online
52:52 - degree program it's a it's a good school
52:55 - it's accredited and and they only have a
52:57 - few programs one of them is software
53:00 - development software development yeah
53:01 - yeah and that's what you studied same
53:03 - thing that Bo KS uh from free C Camp
53:06 - that runs the Freo Camp YouTube channel
53:08 - and is you know helping uh me you know
53:11 - with uh this video get this video up on
53:13 - YouTube thanks bo uh same we can make
53:17 - podcast about Bo sorry to interject but
53:20 - the things that like the creative things
53:22 - he has done as far as how he has flipped
53:26 - uh the YouTube space it's just amazing
53:28 - yeah sorry something he's just huge fan
53:30 - of his work yeah he's a huge inspiration
53:32 - for me and it's a joy to work alongside
53:34 - him he's just a chill down to earth
53:36 - family man like you and I right like I I
53:38 - feel like I have so much in common not
53:40 - that I have a lot of his uh
53:42 - characteristics as a teacher like he's
53:43 - just an incredible teacher uh so how was
53:46 - the uh WGU experience because I always
53:48 - tell people like you know I'm a big fan
53:50 - of University and yes I can totally see
53:53 - people saying like oh University's
53:54 - overpriced blah blah blah and I age
53:56 - degree and that's why free Camp of
53:57 - course we're working on eventually
53:59 - having a free uh accredited University
54:01 - degree program that will take another 10
54:03 - or 15 years to finish preparing sorry
54:05 - it's taking so long but it's a big big
54:07 - project but in the meantime pgu is is a
54:10 - good alternative to that and it's very
54:12 - inexpensive compared to not necessarily
54:14 - compared to Community College especially
54:16 - California Community College programs
54:17 - are very inexpensive and if you happen
54:19 - to live in California absolutely attend
54:21 - Community College it's one of like yeah
54:23 - the best educational experiences you can
54:25 - have in the United States
54:26 - but what was that like that's exactly
54:28 - the the point what I was going to make
54:30 - like listen uh I do agree that that
54:32 - universities are super expensive but you
54:35 - can definitely always start with
54:36 - Community College you will get service
54:38 - if not even better because essentially
54:40 - with in there they have time to work
54:42 - with you right so you just need to spend
54:44 - time on essentially looking for like
54:46 - maybe I I was doing quite a bit of
54:49 - research where essentially I was looking
54:50 - for you know not not the easiest for
54:53 - example chemistry teacher but the one
54:55 - that actually teaches the one that
54:56 - spends time with you instead of just
54:58 - like giving you the textbook and all
54:59 - that so I was definitely doing that and
55:02 - like Community College is an awesome way
55:03 - to actually see whether you that's for
55:06 - you to begin with and second it it just
55:08 - prepares you for the school and I was
55:11 - just really lucky that uh WG accepted
55:14 - all the credits uh but what was
55:16 - happening so that time I was already
55:18 - recording videos and essentially that
55:21 - the second second half year was like I
55:24 - wasn't I was kind of doing it half I
55:26 - would say half half time not like like
55:30 - part-time sorry part- time yeah um and I
55:33 - want to talk about the mechanics of your
55:34 - success as a tutorial Creator course
55:37 - creator um you have nearly 200,000
55:41 - subscribers on coding addict which is
55:43 - the name of your uh YouTube channel
55:45 - which has
55:46 - 786 videos uploaded uh you know they say
55:50 - Quantity has a quality all its own there
55:53 - there's quite a bit quite a bit of
55:55 - quality in that quantity I imagine
55:56 - and then of course many of your courses
55:58 - we've anthologized them and published
56:00 - them on free camps YouTube channel you
56:02 - also of course have udem me uh where
56:04 - you've got a lot of courses listed maybe
56:07 - maybe uh before we get I want to talk
56:08 - about the entrepreneurial aspect of this
56:11 - because you've essentially built a
56:13 - business around helping teach people how
56:15 - to code right so it was one of those
56:18 - things where effectively the moment I
56:19 - started recording videos like I
56:21 - mentioned there was those two benefits
56:22 - right so I can research the topic and
56:24 - then I can always get
56:26 - uh some info back but then also slowly
56:30 - but surely the there was like this bug
56:33 - just in your head where effectively the
56:35 - moment I learn something I just want to
56:37 - make a video and it's not again it's not
56:39 - about whether it's going to get 10,000
56:40 - views or whatever it's just one of those
56:42 - things like listen I like I just learned
56:44 - it I just figure out like some kind of
56:47 - way some kind of like small app or some
56:49 - kind of small instance where that could
56:51 - be super useful let me make a video
56:53 - about it right so just so and then
56:55 - mentally in my head I'm like okay that's
56:57 - done I can kind of move on to a second
56:59 - thing and it was one of those things
57:02 - where it just like you produce one video
57:05 - second you do more research you do like
57:08 - you start working on your own projects
57:09 - you record more and it just kind of took
57:12 - off took off took off but it's one of
57:14 - those like unfortunate things where
57:17 - essentially it's like it's impossible to
57:19 - survive of the YouTube there's no like
57:22 - if you want to keep doing that then then
57:24 - then there needs to be some kind of
57:25 - Revenue like I mean in a perfect world I
57:28 - would just take everything and upload on
57:30 - YouTube and just call it a day but
57:33 - unfortunately that's not the case so I
57:35 - enjoy really teaching and recording
57:36 - videos but at the same time you do need
57:39 - to have some kind of stream of income so
57:42 - over the years I have kind of come up
57:44 - with the like at least in my my opinion
57:46 - like the best case scenario at least for
57:48 - me at this point where essentially I
57:50 - have like a large like I make a large
57:53 - course and make a large chunk of that
57:55 - for free and then effectively people
57:57 - enjoy the style if they enjoy the
57:59 - content if they you know are willing to
58:01 - support then they can you know pay some
58:05 - extra money uh and then effectively they
58:07 - can buy the entire course right but they
58:10 - they already have the good idea that
58:11 - whether they like it or not so it's not
58:13 - the case where you need to entally spend
58:16 - the money and be like okay I don't
58:17 - really like him I don't like his accent
58:19 - I don't like his style whatever so yeah
58:22 - that kind of has been um the my Approach
58:25 - but to tell honestly I'm not I'm not
58:28 - like Elon Musk you know type of like oh
58:31 - I'm just going to build this amazing
58:33 - business for me it's literally comes
58:34 - down to like I just enjoy uh kind of
58:37 - terminology or there's some type of like
58:39 - function that does something for me I
58:41 - think the biggest bug is to kind of how
58:43 - I can like like make an example out of
58:46 - this that makes sense not just okay
58:48 - everyone can read the docs and say like
58:50 - okay this function is doing such and
58:51 - such but okay what would be the perfect
58:53 - use case right what would be the perfect
58:55 - use case and the one that wouldn't
58:57 - require you like three hours of prepare
58:59 - or something like that so that to me has
59:01 - always been that's what drives me back
59:05 - right so when people say that whether
59:07 - there every job has some downsides and
59:09 - whatever right so for me sometimes it's
59:11 - it's recording right because it's just
59:14 - sometimes it's it's the actual recording
59:15 - process is I'm I'm not you know there's
59:18 - some challenges but as far as preparing
59:20 - the content is just like that's what
59:22 - makes me kind of like get up in the
59:24 - morning like super excited because I
59:25 - know that oh like nextjs came out with
59:28 - this new thing let's see like what we
59:29 - can do what we can build with that like
59:31 - what kind of like in which instances
59:33 - this is going to be super like helpful
59:35 - like let's say better than than the
59:37 - previous one so yeah that was kind of
59:40 - that that that's the idea and again I
59:43 - need to bring in free Cod camp and I was
59:45 - uh essentially this is what I did I
59:47 - produced the HTML and CSS course I put
59:50 - stuff for free on YouTube and I got an
59:54 - email from Bo who's running the free
59:56 - code camp and he's like are you okay
59:59 - with essentially like reposting this and
60:02 - and I was like yeah we we had a meeting
60:04 - and everything I'm like oh yeah sure
60:05 - sure sure everything go everything is
60:08 - awesome and we can do that and all that
60:10 - and yeah next thing we know he posted
60:11 - and that kind of took off the whole like
60:14 - you know making the content and then
60:16 - producing courses um yeah it it just
60:20 - that that one email and then the
60:22 - partnership kind of just just helped
60:25 - really well I just want to observe that
60:27 - like your business model is very
60:29 - transparent uh like hey if you like this
60:32 - multi hour segment of this course you
60:35 - want to buy the entire course how much
60:37 - are most of your courses I try I'm
60:40 - mostly at least 20 hours 20 hours and
60:43 - how much how much do they cost if you
60:45 - want to buy like a full course I I I so
60:48 - UD Deming has the specific policy of
60:50 - prices so it's one of those things where
60:52 - they uh they they run on this kind of
60:55 - sales thing right so everything's always
60:58 - it's it's one of those things where in
60:59 - some cases it's actually let's say it's
61:01 - interesting so let's say one day they
61:02 - can have it for like whatever I don't
61:04 - know $80 right but on the other day when
61:07 - they have the promotion as much as like
61:10 - bad rep you Demi gets at the same time
61:12 - for example they sell those courses for
61:16 - whatever $11 bought in a local currency
61:18 - yeah right so that's even like
61:20 - essentially uh what the students are
61:22 - telling that's even cheaper so it's not
61:24 - just like $10 let's say in in some in
61:26 - some other plac is going to be actually
61:28 - way more because if you transfer but
61:30 - they kind of see what $10 would mean in
61:33 - us and what that like means in some
61:35 - other country and then they make it
61:37 - actually the price very reasonable in my
61:39 - opinion purchasing price power oh God
61:43 - pricing power purchasing parody or
61:45 - something like that I can't remember
61:46 - what stands for but yeah it's one of
61:49 - those terms that like I I read it I
61:52 - understand it but I'm like I don't have
61:54 - enough courage to to pronounce but my my
61:58 - point is these are not like thousand to
62:00 - learn the code Type like you'll see
62:01 - these things you'll see people like my
62:03 - complete coding course it's only $1,000
62:06 - and I I find people all these time uh on
62:08 - like uh Twitter like hey like uh what
62:11 - what do I do like I paid like I used my
62:13 - entire educational Budget on this one
62:15 - course from this guy who promised that I
62:16 - was going to learn everything I needed
62:17 - to know about coding right and like so a
62:19 - lot of people come to free C Camp we
62:21 - call them like refugees from other
62:23 - course platforms and things like that
62:25 - but I will say if you like I'm am not an
62:28 - absolutist like educa I I say education
62:31 - wants to be free but like I at the same
62:33 - time there are many many thoughtful
62:35 - teachers and creators who have kids to
62:37 - feed who want to you know be able to pay
62:40 - their mortgage and stuff like that you
62:42 - know paying 15 2050 $100 for a course is
62:45 - not a big deal if you have the money uh
62:48 - I I spent that much money on like you
62:51 - know learning how to play bass and stuff
62:52 - like buy a bass course or something like
62:54 - that uh I don't uh I think it's totally
62:57 - fine uh to to spend money on courses um
63:01 - you don't have to of course but if you
63:04 - want to John smga has amazing courses
63:07 - and I will say that he does not underd
63:10 - deliver a lot of people out there
63:11 - overpromise and under deliver and I can
63:15 - say with confidence that you've never
63:16 - done that because like you've already
63:19 - got this huge chunk of the course it's
63:20 - completely free made freely available
63:23 - both through your YouTube channel or
63:24 - through freeco camp.org
63:26 - and it's just like there there's this
63:29 - concept in economics called consumer
63:32 - surplus and what it is is like you
63:34 - create x amount of value and you capture
63:38 - you know y amount of value those are I'm
63:40 - not sure if I'm doing it justice like
63:42 - explaining it correctly but like
63:44 - Wikipedia would be an example of a site
63:46 - that creates a tremendous amount of
63:47 - value and captures a very small amount
63:49 - of it uh you know a software as a
63:52 - service you know
63:53 - sales uh you know database type program
63:58 - might capture something closer to like
63:59 - 50% of the value they ultimately create
64:02 - you're helping the customer increase
64:03 - their sales by 50% but you or by 100%
64:07 - but you're charging them you know 50% of
64:08 - that to use your platform or something
64:10 - like that right uh so like those are the
64:14 - extremes right like Wikipedia down here
64:16 - Craigslist maybe here and then like you
64:18 - know obviously free C Camp would be like
64:19 - way down there with Wikipedia in terms
64:21 - of people are just donating and things
64:22 - like that and most small independent
64:25 - course creator creers like you like
64:27 - coder coder Jessica Chan uh like West
64:30 - boss uh you know all these people like
64:34 - what they are charging for their courses
64:36 - is almost nothing compared to the value
64:38 - that you're going to get out of taking
64:40 - these courses and then going and selling
64:42 - your uh your labor on the open market
64:45 - for software Engineers right uh or or so
64:48 - much from John so uh I I just want to
64:51 - very quickly clarify that like there are
64:54 - a lot of things that keep me up late at
64:55 - night about education and the direction
64:57 - things are heading and things like that
64:58 - but like course creators on YouTube and
65:01 - on udem me and uh you know creating
65:03 - their own platforms and stuff you you
65:05 - got your own website uh which I think is
65:07 - so cool that your your name John smga
65:10 - JS and you happen to teach JS you teach
65:13 - JavaScript uh but it's it's just John
65:16 - smga.com coding addict because you're
65:18 - you're uh you're like Fab icon on
65:20 - john.com is like JS and it kind of you
65:22 - should like make it
65:24 - yellow yeah yellow black like the JS I
65:26 - never thought of that should have done
65:28 - that yeah so like maybe you could talk
65:32 - about what your life has been like since
65:33 - you started creating courses and
65:35 - teaching I mean at this point it's got
65:36 - to be millions of people that have gone
65:38 - through at least part of one your
65:40 - courses on free C Camp I'm sure it's
65:42 - millions of people uh and you probably
65:44 - have like analytics on like how many
65:46 - people according to UD to me I think you
65:47 - have like let's see on udem me it's it
65:51 - was like okay let's take a
65:54 - look students you've got 27,000 reviews
65:58 - those are people that bought the course
66:00 - took the course and took the time to
66:02 - leave a review about it that probably a
66:04 - positive review right that's a that's a
66:05 - pretty big impact that you've had over
66:07 - the past you know seven or eight years
66:09 - how long youve been creating
66:11 - courses I think I want to say well we
66:15 - moved I would like courses I believe
66:18 - 2017 18 something like that so about
66:21 - about like seven years probably and yeah
66:24 - I mean the ground you have covered we
66:25 - were talking about YouTube just a second
66:26 - ago more than 700 videos maybe you can
66:28 - talk about what your life has been like
66:30 - before and after you became a Creator
66:32 - because my understanding is your wife is
66:36 - able to focus on taking care of your
66:38 - kids full-time and she does she work as
66:40 - a nurse at all anymore is she like
66:42 - part-time or no no no no no no so so
66:45 - luckily at the moment uh we can have a
66:49 - setup where she's a stay-at-home mom uh
66:52 - we have 5-year-old and a 2-year-old and
66:55 - uh we decided at least for now again
66:58 - everything is fluid so everything might
67:00 - change but since my oldest one
67:03 - technically she was born in August so
67:05 - it's uh she can actually she doesn't
67:07 - need to start the elementary school
67:10 - right now she can still technically wait
67:12 - a year um but we decided that regardless
67:15 - we're most likely going to go with
67:17 - homeschool that for now seems to be a
67:19 - good option my wife is super good at lot
67:22 - of teaching yeah she's like super into
67:25 - it I mean I mean she just sits and
67:26 - researches the math the reading and what
67:29 - are the options where where are the best
67:31 - books and what we can do and I don't
67:33 - know it just seems like uh it's also
67:35 - better for the girls because she was
67:38 - going for but that was the like um
67:41 - private kindergarten mhm and actually
67:44 - the little sister didn't like that if
67:46 - the older was gone and the bigger one
67:48 - also when she came back she was like she
67:51 - like basically she likes it better at
67:53 - home and then my wife can actually study
67:55 - with both of them so the little one sits
67:57 - there and also is like you know adding
67:59 - two plus two and stuff like that so we
68:02 - were able to do that just to add a
68:04 - little bit on those courses yeah the my
68:06 - kind of I always just naturally not
68:09 - because I like made some big commitment
68:11 - but I always like looked up to to free
68:14 - Cod camp and stuff and I made this
68:15 - decision where I'm not going to be like
68:18 - trying to sell something which is not
68:20 - true like I would never say in my course
68:22 - Hey listen finish this course and you'll
68:24 - get a job because I person
68:25 - know that there's no course in a world
68:28 - that can teach you that like instead you
68:30 - should be going and networking and doing
68:32 - all those things instead of like I would
68:34 - even say at this point kind of I I I
68:36 - don't want to maybe use this term but
68:38 - like coding it's not the hardest part
68:40 - right it's not easy it still takes time
68:42 - but it's actually in order to get a job
68:44 - and to get an industry there's tons of
68:46 - other things you need to do coding at
68:47 - this point there's so many courses that
68:49 - you if you stuck to it if you are not
68:51 - just buying 10,000 courses just for the
68:53 - sake of buying even though it feels
68:55 - great trust me I it feels great to buy a
68:57 - course I have lots of Jiu-Jitsu courses
68:59 - and trust me it hasn't made me better
69:01 - but it's just that feeling when you buy
69:03 - it and and everything is great and
69:05 - actually you wait you learn way more in
69:07 - in the actual class but anyway that's a
69:09 - sign point but there is tons of these
69:12 - resources courses uh free code camp and
69:16 - and YouTube and everything if you like
69:18 - really like dedicate your time you can
69:20 - learn all of that for very small
69:21 - fraction of price but unfortunately
69:24 - since like communication is a kind of a
69:27 - like a strange Topic in a sense because
69:29 - some people are super good at it and for
69:31 - example I'm not right and it's one of
69:33 - those things where you tell somebody
69:34 - like they're asking like Hey listen
69:36 - which course I should take in order to
69:37 - get in industry and it's one of those
69:38 - things where like I say listen there's
69:40 - no course in the world that can do that
69:42 - for you because the first thing you need
69:44 - to do is get into your local community
69:46 - and start talking to the people who
69:47 - actually work there because they will
69:48 - tell you what you need to learn what are
69:50 - the what what is required actually in
69:52 - that part of the world where where you
69:54 - live and us when you say that you just
69:56 - see the people like come on like I was
69:59 - expecting something you know to to get
70:01 - some better answer but that honestly is
70:03 - the truth and that's why I never want to
70:06 - like kind of make something like give
70:08 - some false promises in the sense that uh
70:11 - you know get this and then everything is
70:13 - going to be fine the way I view the
70:15 - content Creation in general is something
70:16 - like listen if somebody spends some time
70:20 - to like like I mentioned before make
70:23 - this into into something use let's say
70:25 - there's there's some kind of feature and
70:27 - they spend their time on on on working
70:29 - on the example on feature or whatever
70:32 - that's something where I'm like yeah you
70:33 - know what I want to spend I want to
70:36 - support that person whether that's
70:37 - watching through the YouTube video or
70:39 - paying some money in order to to help
70:42 - them but at the same time I'll get some
70:44 - valuable info also right so that has
70:47 - always been my case and I kind of made
70:49 - decision that listen if it's not going
70:50 - to be sustainable well then I'll have to
70:53 - you know effectively just just you know
70:55 - do something else in a sense like you
70:56 - know just go just go back to work but I
70:59 - don't want to turn into this like hey
71:01 - you know NeverEnding sales pictures and
71:03 - stuff I it's just not for me I
71:05 - definitely know that and I'm not even
71:07 - going to try that there are so many
71:08 - people coming into the software
71:10 - development space and I always say like
71:12 - currently there are about maybe 30
71:14 - million soft working professional
71:16 - software developers on Earth and that
71:18 - number is only going to go up like don't
71:21 - believe the hype that like AI is just
71:23 - going to like take care of everything
71:24 - you know
71:25 - uh I I get these questions all the time
71:27 - like software Engineers are still going
71:29 - to be involved you know in making
71:32 - important decisions about software and
71:35 - architecture and you know features
71:37 - design all these different things right
71:39 - like uh it it will be a very long time I
71:41 - don't think it will happen in our
71:42 - lifetime where like we just it's like
71:44 - the Jetson you just press button and
71:46 - then finished production level grade
71:48 - software just rolls out of the assembly
71:50 - line no I don't think that's going to
71:51 - happen I I think what's likely to happen
71:53 - is over the next 20 30 years more and
71:55 - more will be pushed to the software
71:57 - layer individual developers will become
71:59 - more productive maybe wages won't stay
72:02 - at their stratospheric levels that you
72:04 - have like I have developer friends who
72:06 - make $800,000 a year working as software
72:09 - developers they're not even managers
72:11 - right like I don't think that that's
72:13 - necessarily going to be what the future
72:15 - holds in terms of like it being this
72:17 - incredibly highly paid job but I do
72:20 - think it'll be a really good job it's
72:21 - going to be a job where you have like
72:22 - high quality life you're getting to do
72:24 - creative work you're to use you know
72:26 - Cutting Edge tools as they come out um
72:30 - and as a result if we're doubling the
72:32 - number of developers if there are 60
72:34 - million developers on Earth by the time
72:36 - I die hopefully you know 100 years from
72:38 - now or something um then I think that
72:42 - that's so many people coming into the
72:44 - field that it can support a lot of
72:46 - teachers right and what's the worst
72:48 - thing that happens I mean you said
72:49 - yourself like oh I just got to go get a
72:51 - cushy software engineering job somewhere
72:53 - right with my incredible you know uh
72:56 - collection of skills that I built up
72:58 - teaching for over the past seven years
73:00 - right yeah it was just kind of in my
73:02 - case it was always like listen even the
73:04 - in the worst case scenario the fallback
73:05 - is not like it's it's not something that
73:07 - I would ever complain about my idea is
73:09 - that it's just as I was looking to you
73:11 - and reading like for example your story
73:13 - of how the commitment you made to free
73:15 - Cod Camp I just like knowing how I am in
73:19 - a sense where I'm not I'm like super bad
73:21 - in this like sales pctures and whatever
73:24 - I just made the commitment said listen
73:26 - if you know if everything is going well
73:28 - awesome if not then I'll just have to
73:30 - make you know you know certain choices
73:32 - which again is something that I was
73:34 - working towards anyway it's just you
73:36 - know I I didn't expect that teaching was
73:38 - something that I really enjoy that much
73:40 - uh but it's you know again we this is
73:43 - totally fluid situation and as far as
73:47 - like I wouldn't even say teaching and
73:50 - before teaching like biggest difference
73:51 - for us was the kids like you know it's
73:53 - it's it just changes everything and this
73:55 - is and this is the fact where it
73:57 - definitely the fact that I can still
73:59 - manage my schedule is just super helpful
74:03 - with the fact that I can like you know
74:05 - it's I've been able to be involved in in
74:08 - in my kids life and that just been it's
74:11 - one of those things where people say
74:12 - that and yeah and it sounds cheesy and
74:14 - whatever but it is the case where I have
74:16 - been you know able to teach my daughter
74:19 - how to ride a bike we're like you know I
74:22 - we go swimming together and stuff like
74:24 - that and those things are the ones that
74:25 - actually matter in in the long term
74:28 - right because I again we like it's one
74:32 - of those things i' I've been kind of a
74:33 - little bit obsessed lately that I'm
74:34 - thinking that we like of course we all
74:37 - do important things and but at the end
74:39 - of the day I don't know based on my
74:42 - experience what I'm seeing it's like
74:45 - work is super important but at the end
74:47 - of the day 20 years or 30 years from now
74:50 - like maybe we give it too much of a like
74:52 - kind of importance where essentially
74:55 - it's it's important at the moment in
74:57 - work I'm not saying not to work but
74:59 - there are things that actually like are
75:01 - far more important and that's that's
75:03 - been super awesome that I've been able
75:05 - to do kind re combine everything that's
75:08 - one of the reasons I'm so hyped about
75:09 - helping more people gain these skills is
75:11 - because I do firmly believe like I feel
75:14 - incredibly blessed to be able to
75:15 - basically hang out with my kids all day
75:17 - every day like they're a little older
75:19 - now they're six and eight and uh we we
75:21 - moved to Texas to a district that has
75:24 - like a really good School District
75:26 - that's public uh where I can walk my
75:28 - kids to school and we can live in the
75:29 - BBS and you know it's it's kind of like
75:31 - the the American dream of like the 50s
75:33 - or 60s right like we're here like pretty
75:36 - much everybody in our neighborhood is an
75:37 - immigrant from China or the Middle East
75:40 - or Africa like they all moved here
75:42 - because this is like this there's a good
75:44 - school here there's a high quality of
75:45 - life the level of affordability is great
75:49 - compared to California where I was
75:50 - living previously where you used to live
75:52 - now you're you're over in Florida right
75:54 - yeah we're in s sort yeah yeah so so
75:57 - that's really cool that you were able to
75:58 - move out there your wife doesn't need to
76:00 - work anymore my wife doesn't need to
76:01 - work anymore as an accountant uh again I
76:03 - feel very privileged to be in that
76:07 - circumstance where I can hang out with
76:08 - my kids and I genuinely believe more
76:10 - people can do this especially now that
76:11 - employers are kind of waking up to the
76:13 - fact that like oh you know people can
76:14 - work remotely they still get things done
76:16 - even if you're not standing over them
76:17 - with your arms crossed like making them
76:19 - punch in and you know or installing
76:21 - weird maybe maybe some companies install
76:23 - software to track like whether actually
76:25 - doing keystrokes and stuff but like
76:27 - obviously we don't use any of that stuff
76:29 - at fre Camp is like very uh lazy AFF ER
76:32 - so to speak um but I think this is how
76:34 - humans are supposed to be able to live
76:36 - not like dropping their kids off a
76:38 - daycare and coming home at like 6 p.m.
76:41 - and everybody's stressed out nobody's
76:43 - had enough sleep like I I don't feel
76:45 - like that that window of time was
76:47 - representative of what human experience
76:49 - is supposed to be like I mean if you
76:51 - look at The Agrarian period that
76:54 - basically eded industrialization people
76:56 - spend a ton of time with their kids
76:58 - right yeah it was one of those things
77:00 - that I do still remember from uh I
77:02 - believe even uh when I went into
77:05 - Community College for a history lesson
77:07 - one of the first things that we were we
77:09 - were discussing the ancient like like I
77:12 - think very very beginnings of the human
77:14 - human humans and essentially he asked
77:17 - like how like uh the collectors and
77:20 - gatherers or the hunters and gather
77:22 - hunters and gatherers like how much like
77:24 - how many hours do you think they worked
77:26 - like and everyone is like oh 8 n
77:29 - something they're like no like actual
77:31 - the idea is that they like worked few
77:33 - hours and they pretty much rested the
77:34 - entire day and and again it's not I
77:37 - fully understand that this is a luxury
77:39 - and everything and I and I definitely
77:41 - appreciate that but I'm just saying that
77:43 - for me it was never the case where uh
77:47 - like like putting all the time work at
77:50 - the very top I don't think it's it's
77:52 - it's particularly useful especially like
77:54 - you know 20 30 years from now I I really
77:57 - don't so it's it's always like it's just
78:00 - finding that good balance where I I
78:02 - enjoy my work don't get me wrong like I
78:04 - enjoy getting up and and working on
78:06 - stuff but there has to be a cut off
78:07 - where uh it's not you know it's not the
78:10 - primary thing and and just by improving
78:12 - your skills and improving your
78:13 - productivity through designing processes
78:16 - you know automating things you can get
78:19 - the same amount of work done in less
78:21 - time and that like like I still work you
78:23 - know 40 hours a week
78:25 - but I do so from the convenience of my
78:27 - own home and my office here at my
78:29 - standing desk where I'm recording this
78:31 - podcast interview like uh and I just
78:34 - automate a lot of stuff or I I rethink
78:35 - the process why is this taking so much
78:37 - time each week is there a better way you
78:39 - know and just gradually refining it and
78:41 - then I can move on and do more
78:42 - interesting work that's not solved so to
78:44 - speak solve work by the time it's
78:46 - automated it's essentially solved and
78:48 - other than basic maintenance should need
78:49 - to come back to it you can go do other
78:50 - things right like I didn't have time to
78:52 - do podcast interviews before cuz I was
78:54 - so busy
78:55 - uh working on other aspects of free Cod
78:57 - camp but as I've gradually had more time
78:59 - free up I can do things like this and
79:01 - I'm I'm super grateful for that I'm
79:02 - super grateful for the technology that
79:04 - enables this uh and that I'm super
79:07 - grateful to my past self who put in the
79:09 - time and energy to learn how to use
79:11 - these Technologies so that I could
79:12 - essentially free and I imagined that
79:14 - like I maybe I'll never need to retire
79:16 - maybe I'll just be able to keep finding
79:18 - new problems to work on and the work
79:19 - will remain fresh and
79:21 - interesting yeah I'm I'm very optimistic
79:24 - about that how do you feel feel about
79:25 - the future like you're you're still
79:26 - pretty young you're like slightly
79:27 - younger than me um you've got two young
79:30 - kids uh what is the next 20 years hold
79:33 - for you well that's actually a super
79:35 - good question because we are in the
79:36 - process I mean it's not going to happen
79:38 - tomorrow or whatever but uh we clearly
79:41 - made our mind that in like I would say
79:44 - two years Max simply because we just
79:47 - need to basically complete some things
79:49 - in here but in general we are moving
79:51 - back to to see parents more often
79:54 - because our parents are both getting old
79:56 - and we just decided that it's one of
79:58 - those things where we do want our kids
79:59 - to spend time more time with with with
80:02 - them and that's definitely going to be
80:05 - like very interesting because like we
80:08 - like we just enjoy Europe for some
80:10 - reason I don't know every time visit
80:12 - it's like my wife is just ecstatic about
80:14 - it so it's definitely going to be the
80:15 - case where essentially we're going to be
80:17 - moving yeah after that I don't know so
80:20 - it's it's one of those things where I'm
80:21 - just like looking at that and and and
80:23 - and it's def going to be the case where
80:25 - I I I do want to stick with
80:28 - homeschooling um my kids I just think
80:30 - that it's it's it's it's an awesome way
80:33 - to actually spend more time with my kid
80:36 - I realized that teaching teaching them
80:38 - math and and reading and and it's
80:39 - actually like super fun yeah right so it
80:42 - doesn't have to be this like hey you do
80:44 - this as I say instead you're just
80:45 - engaging with it you're trying to
80:47 - understand like what's the reason why
80:49 - you're not getting it what's the reason
80:50 - why you're looking everywhere else but
80:52 - the book and stuff like that so that
80:54 - that has been super exciting and um yeah
80:58 - just on homeschooling like you know your
81:00 - kids have two well educated parents who
81:02 - are multilingual Multicultural have all
81:04 - this lived experience to impart to them
81:08 - uh and so yeah like I think that's
81:09 - amazing you're able to spend so much
81:11 - time teaching them I taught my kids to
81:13 - read individually like we would just
81:15 - read every night uh before we got in the
81:17 - bath and stuff and uh yeah over the
81:20 - course of like a couple years they got
81:21 - pretty good at reading and it it's just
81:24 - you a little bit of incremental but it
81:26 - was so amazing it's such a an amazing
81:29 - process like if you have young kids I
81:31 - strongly encourage teaching them how to
81:32 - read yourself like you of course they're
81:34 - probably going to if they go to school
81:35 - they'll probably get some exposure to it
81:37 - too but like they can learn to read much
81:39 - faster than like the public school
81:41 - system is going to repair them to read
81:42 - right and it's just such an amazing like
81:46 - miraculous process of watching them
81:48 - sound things out and say all these weird
81:50 - things and like make common you know
81:52 - grammatical mistakes like irregular
81:53 - verbs and stuff like that and just
81:55 - watching it gradually get ironed out
81:57 - over time like I'll never forget the the
82:00 - process of my son being able to finally
82:02 - recognize that th e spelled the because
82:05 - it's such a weird you know word like uh
82:08 - or the or what it depends on where it is
82:10 - in the sentence right um and and just
82:13 - little things like that or or learning
82:14 - how to read the word bright like b r i g
82:18 - HT like how do you you know and watching
82:21 - him struggle with it and then explaining
82:22 - a regular you know you know or silent uh
82:26 - consonants and things like that and like
82:28 - yeah I love teaching and teaching my
82:31 - kids was just like it was an absolute
82:34 - highlight of my life so far um so I I
82:36 - just want to say like I think your kids
82:37 - are really lucky to have you teaching
82:40 - them and your your wife teaching them as
82:42 - well you said that you were planning to
82:44 - go back to Europe of course uh laia is a
82:47 - great place like I have a friend Islam
82:49 - maos who runs codzilla um and his his
82:53 - wife is Lan I believe and and so he's
82:55 - been living there for a long time he
82:56 - moved there actually the what's
82:58 - interesting tching is is booming laia
83:01 - for I'm not I'm not that familiar with
83:04 - the webd but as far as I know because uh
83:08 - my brother works as a well he's a
83:10 - software like he's a [ __ ] manager he's
83:12 - not coding himself but he works for a
83:14 - pretty big Bank in the region and
83:17 - essentially what he all the time keeps
83:18 - saying that there's like super big need
83:21 - for Java developers like like literally
83:23 - they they have like very very
83:26 - Progressive programs of how to get
83:27 - people actually into the tech so you
83:30 - like in United States I haven't seen
83:32 - that that often where essentially they
83:34 - literally can take someone from the
83:37 - street as long as they show interest
83:39 - they will teach them they will try to
83:42 - give them the ership yes it's going to
83:45 - be for very very low money in the
83:46 - beginning but they can get their foot in
83:48 - door and then they slowly move up
83:50 - because there's quite a big quite a few
83:52 - big companies that are actually
83:53 - internationally recognized and also
83:55 - there's quite a quite a few gaming
83:58 - companies so that's one of those
84:00 - interesting things where as far as
84:01 - texing in laa it's again things are
84:04 - fluid but at the moment they're they're
84:06 - actually it's kind of booming and
84:07 - everything so yeah yeah I just don't
84:09 - know about the web that much yeah well
84:11 - that sounds really cool um one country
84:14 - that obviously is not having quite a
84:17 - nice time that your wife is from Ukraine
84:20 - which has been you know illegally and uh
84:24 - you're not going to get any sympathy
84:26 - like I I very much am on a side and that
84:29 - side is Ukraine here in this conflict
84:32 - and of course your wife being from
84:33 - Ukraine uh on your your Twitter profile
84:35 - you you have the Ukrainian flag you say
84:37 - we stand with Ukraine what's the how how
84:40 - is your wife's family doing back there
84:43 - are they okay it's I mean it's one of
84:45 - those things where essentially you I
84:48 - mean how long the war has been going on
84:50 - already right so two two years right and
84:54 - uh
84:54 - it's it's it's like you're more or less
84:56 - like normalizing this but in general
84:59 - it's yeah it's it's it's one of those
85:02 - things where it's even hard to explain
85:03 - her her brother was in the war he was he
85:06 - went to serve he got
85:09 - essentially he was wounded so he he was
85:13 - able to come back home but it's the the
85:16 - things that you see the things that he
85:18 - like you know is told us and everything
85:21 - it's just it's one of those things where
85:22 - you think that we're living in 21st
85:25 - century and this is you know how this is
85:27 - even possible it's it's it's
85:29 - mindboggling and uh it's super super
85:34 - rough in a sense like I mean there's so
85:36 - many aspects of that are s like are just
85:39 - tragic about it when you just walk like
85:41 - I don't know five miles with with all
85:43 - all your belongings and two small kids
85:45 - across the field just to get out and
85:47 - things like that and I'm not even
85:48 - talking about like you know the the
85:49 - horrors of the war and everything or the
85:52 - Rockets flying and all that it's just
85:54 - it's been one of those things where like
85:56 - I really like tick off uh like basically
86:00 - every time like even think about it and
86:02 - all that and it's just it's just sad
86:04 - that there's not enough like kind of
86:06 - help to to just to just kind of get rid
86:09 - of this and um for me I always like I I
86:13 - find it interesting where I do see that
86:16 - people in like a lot of people in
86:18 - Western countries they don't know what
86:20 - it's like to live right next to Russia
86:22 - and that whole like you know mentality
86:25 - there's always these excuses well only
86:27 - if the NATO wouldn't be expanding and
86:29 - all that stuff where essentially the
86:31 - only NATO is the only thing that keeps
86:33 - us safe for now technically in ltia
86:35 - because otherwise every time you're
86:37 - seeing this like those things happen
86:39 - that are not NATO countries so uh this
86:42 - kind of mentality like I was like even
86:44 - mentioned before a little bit where like
86:46 - when we grew up and and we still do in
86:48 - lvia that that let's say the the fact
86:50 - that there any moment the war can break
86:53 - out is real it's not some like that you
86:56 - know you know family history like for
86:59 - example my granddad had to immigrate to
87:01 - United States so during the world war
87:04 - war I essentially the country was split
87:06 - up and he just called in he basically
87:09 - the the German soldiers came to his
87:11 - house and said listen either we kill you
87:12 - right now or you go and he was basically
87:15 - digging the trenches or whatever right
87:17 - as the front was moving back after the
87:19 - war he he was you know obviously he went
87:22 - through the process of like you know
87:23 - check whether he was he was not in the
87:25 - Army and all that stuff he passed all
87:27 - that and but he could never go back to
87:30 - for example ltia so it was one of those
87:32 - things where you know those stories are
87:34 - real it's not just made up so you know
87:37 - everything like how how the world works
87:39 - and yeah for us it it was like in lvia
87:42 - everybody you talked to it they were all
87:44 - like everyone around that like those
87:47 - Soviet countries and whatever we know
87:49 - what it's like we know what it what it
87:50 - means like freed by Russians right that
87:54 - it just means simply genocide that's it
87:57 - you know so it was it's been one of
87:59 - those cases where yeah we're we're like
88:02 - trying to help as much as possible like
88:04 - people back in Ukraine and and the the
88:07 - the families who have migrated over here
88:09 - and and just just looking for options
88:11 - like what we can do and all that but
88:12 - yeah it's it's one of those things where
88:14 - I can just it's hard to kind of explain
88:17 - the in in nutshell like everything that
88:20 - that we're going through what we're
88:22 - thinking and and and like you know how
88:25 - how we feel about it so yeah I my friend
88:29 - Sergey uh who runs crow in which is a
88:32 - localization tool we have a crowding
88:35 - course on Freo camp that we recently
88:36 - published Top by espania uh excellent
88:40 - tool if you want to localize your
88:41 - website into different languages and you
88:43 - want to use human translation instead of
88:45 - just using Google translat or
88:46 - something uh of course they're a
88:49 - Ukrainian company and uh so he's running
88:53 - this entire Tech startup basically out
88:55 - of a war zone uh and I sent I you know
88:59 - when when the war broke out like a
89:00 - couple years ago I sent him a message I
89:02 - was like man are you okay like is
89:04 - everything going right and he just sent
89:06 - me back this Meme and it was like this
89:08 - meme of like the the the headache and it
89:11 - was like like migraine it's like uh
89:14 - tension headache and then like the whole
89:15 - head is red and it said living next to
89:18 - Russia yeah I mean like listen there's
89:20 - there's many Russians who are very like
89:23 - like you know Forward Thinking and
89:25 - whatever but there's many who are stuck
89:26 - in this idea that like essentially like
89:29 - like like it or not they don't think
89:31 - like of us like the smaller countries as
89:34 - basically that we even are allowed to
89:37 - exist either we are like part of their
89:39 - like Stratosphere or we don't exist and
89:41 - that is kind of like like okay but where
89:43 - do we go from here like what what is the
89:46 - solution and and that's why I've been
89:48 - like yeah super like kind of big on that
89:51 - the fact that listen the only way how
89:53 - you can get peace is essentially just
89:56 - expelling them from there because no
89:58 - other like all the time saying that we
90:01 - just need to appease them in some kind
90:02 - of way I don't see how that is happening
90:04 - because when we're when we're looking
90:06 - from that perspective that we just need
90:08 - to give them something you're looking
90:09 - from the perspective of the west where
90:12 - essentially no one would even start that
90:13 - war to begin with where yes there's like
90:16 - logical sense okay let let's let's agree
90:19 - on something right but that's not how
90:21 - you like in that part of the world
90:23 - that's not not how you think that's not
90:25 - how you use things you're you know
90:27 - there's people who are live who are
90:28 - willing to live of nothing as long as
90:31 - they are country is on that Big Shiny
90:33 - hill whatever that Hill is you know and
90:35 - you're not going to change them by just
90:37 - oh like okay let's give them this
90:38 - territory or that territory and it
90:40 - doesn't like work that way unfortunately
90:42 - yeah their world view is just that like
90:44 - you know it's tied up in some weird like
90:47 - uh I've seen kind of the maps that Putin
90:49 - points to when he tries to justify that
90:51 - like these parts were part of historical
90:53 - Russia or whatever ever and it's like
90:55 - the map is constantly it's just like
90:56 - China with their territory disputes like
90:58 - oh at one point this was part of China
91:00 - too and like you know I'm I'm sure like
91:03 - every country to an extent is probably
91:04 - guilty of like trying to grab a little
91:06 - extra property you know from their
91:08 - neighbors and stuff many wars have been
91:10 - fought over just tiny territorial
91:12 - disputes and stuff but but yeah like to
91:15 - the credit of a lot of Russians that
91:16 - write me every week like how can I get
91:17 - out of Russia I don't want to live here
91:19 - anymore like I I talk to people we we've
91:21 - got a refugee from Russia and plenty of
91:23 - refugees from Ukraine living in my
91:25 - neighborhood going to school with my
91:26 - kids right and and it's just like it
91:29 - sounds like it's just a really big
91:32 - catastrophe to be born in that part of
91:33 - the world in this Century like there
91:36 - there just so much additional headache
91:38 - so much additional stress like why is
91:40 - this happening in 2024 between two
91:43 - countries that are you know relatively
91:45 - prosperous certainly compared to Any
91:47 - Nation in like the 19th century or the
91:49 - 18th century or any anything before that
91:52 - right like Ukraine
91:54 - uh it's basically the Bread Basket of
91:56 - Europe and Russia has more like minerals
92:00 - than like and they have like all this
92:01 - land I don't know it's like wild to me
92:04 - why is there this conflict why can't
92:05 - they work it out but then you look at
92:08 - somebody like Putin and you see that
92:09 - he's just craving and he'll never stop
92:11 - well that that why that's why it was so
92:13 - super funny for me where like Tucker
92:15 - Carlson goes over there and he's like
92:17 - he's trying to make this point
92:19 - essentially what he has been singing
92:20 - right so it was all because of a NATO
92:22 - and blah blah blah blah blah and yet in
92:24 - that interview for half an hour or
92:26 - whatever long he was he goes back to
92:28 - whatever 12th century and you're like
92:30 - real so you want to justify this at the
92:32 - end of the day like so you are even
92:34 - giving him the platform to speak pre
92:36 - Colonial period and he keeps going back
92:39 - to to whatever it that right and that's
92:42 - one of those things where it's it's
92:43 - super interesting to me that like for
92:45 - example in United States I never saw
92:48 - that for for like let me give you just
92:50 - an example right so there was an Iraq
92:52 - war first of all many people were
92:54 - against it and now look at the situation
92:56 - here it's actually a topic which is
92:58 - discussed where people say Hey listen we
93:00 - don't want to get involved let's say
93:02 - with our soldiers we don't want to go
93:03 - and spread democracy or whatever so so
93:05 - my point being here there is a like the
93:09 - like people are talking about it they're
93:10 - discussing it and they're saying listen
93:12 - this was wrong we we shouldn't have done
93:14 - that or whatever but we will move on but
93:16 - what people don't like because for some
93:18 - weird reasons a lot of times like
93:20 - Americans compare themselves to like
93:22 - that like they say yeah but look at us
93:24 - we also yeah there there are some clear
93:26 - issues but the difference is in
93:27 - democracy those those things are
93:29 - discussed it's not like right now let's
93:31 - say England is saying Hey listen um
93:33 - United States you like you used to be
93:36 - our Colony right yeah why don't we make
93:39 - that again right there's actually both
93:42 - countries are working together they
93:43 - moved on that's it
93:45 - absolutely like everybody's just kind
93:48 - Germany and France yeah I mean like
93:50 - years later and like or it's not even
93:51 - that long right like people are people
93:53 - are like and
93:54 - uh they've kind of like acknowledged the
93:56 - sins of the father so to speak and and
93:58 - they've they've moved on and uh
94:01 - yeah obviously that needs to
94:04 - happen with the Baltic states right like
94:06 - that that needs to happen over in
94:08 - Eastern Europe too again I apologize I
94:10 - I'm not an expert in any of these things
94:12 - but just intuitively as like I guess a
94:14 - person who has a right to talk and
94:16 - represent America on this very limited
94:19 - podcast I I I think it's ridiculous that
94:23 - any American would support Russia in
94:25 - this very obvious very illegal very
94:28 - flagrant uh you know land grab frankly
94:32 - no well it's just it's just like an easy
94:34 - kind of excuse like listen this is
94:36 - basically to blame NATO for it but like
94:38 - I think a lot of this what's missed out
94:39 - on the conversation that all of those
94:42 - countries for the same reason because
94:44 - they know what it's like to live right
94:45 - next to it they were like we in lvia we
94:48 - like waited for that day we cheered for
94:50 - that it wasn't like we were like arms
94:53 - around our back and we were like okay
94:54 - okay America says that we need to join
94:56 - NATO it it was never the case we made so
94:58 - many changes and like increased our
95:00 - military budget and all that for a
95:02 - simple and even now we're like living
95:04 - there and there's a like clear fear that
95:07 - this might happen that you will need to
95:09 - make that decision as you were growing
95:11 - up you were told that listen at some
95:13 - point maybe one day you will have to
95:15 - make this decision and that when the war
95:16 - started that was definitely the case
95:18 - where you're like okay this is happening
95:20 - in my lifetime which I never thought
95:21 - that that would be the case I mean war
95:23 - is
95:24 - just like one of those things that I
95:27 - hope we're not having Wars in space
95:29 - hundred of years from now uh I've Got
95:33 - Friends in Korea who have to like
95:34 - basically put their entire life on hold
95:36 - for two years and serve in the military
95:38 - just because North Korea just a brutal
95:40 - dictator who doesn't care about anybody
95:42 - but himself just like Putin basically
95:45 - who he has like
95:46 - 50,000 people that are like dedicated to
95:49 - basically keeping him alive keeping him
95:51 - from getting assassinated keeping him
95:52 - from losing power because he's just like
95:55 - this crazy megal manical you know again
95:58 - I'm not a psychologist but he seems like
96:01 - an incredibly greedy selfish person who
96:05 - uh just wants more even if it means
96:07 - taking from people who need it much
96:09 - worse than he does you know um and and
96:11 - same thing with like North Korea and
96:12 - what's the result like the US has to
96:14 - spend this huge amount of money on
96:16 - military to keep people like Putin from
96:19 - you know pulling stunts right uh and
96:23 - those are not the only countries that
96:24 - are like this but those are two very
96:26 - obvious examples of like just the fact
96:28 - that those people exist in the world and
96:30 - that they're so belligerent forces
96:32 - everybody else all the other kind people
96:34 - have to like keep their guard up and
96:36 - they have to you know adapt to life like
96:38 - if you're in South Korea you just have
96:40 - to accept that if you're in Soul there's
96:42 - a small likelihood that today's going to
96:44 - be the day that they fire all the
96:45 - missiles and completely level the city
96:47 - and kill everybody in it because yeah
96:49 - they do have those missiles and they are
96:51 - pointed at Soul yeah that's it's PR
96:53 - scary when when I was listening that
96:55 - essentially that whatever calculations
96:57 - they did as far as like even in the best
96:59 - case scenario there's millions of just
97:02 - like people dying simply when the war
97:04 - broke even without the nuclear and as
97:06 - far as the North Korea and South Korea
97:08 - and that just to me is like mindboggling
97:11 - that the fact that you know that's the
97:12 - case so um yeah yeah
97:16 - we this is one of those topics where it
97:19 - was just definitely like you know it's
97:21 - like there were a few days when it was
97:22 - like super hard even to to to sit down
97:25 - and do anything you know you're just
97:27 - like you were totally like shocked and
97:30 - everything about the whole situation
97:33 - yeah I mean like if you don't want me
97:35 - asking like we could talk about this for
97:37 - a long time and obviously affecting you
97:39 - and your your wife and her her family
97:41 - you you've always kind of it's always
97:43 - just been there and like Americans we
97:45 - take for granted we got this giant
97:46 - Pacific Ocean on one side we got this
97:48 - giant Atlantic Ocean on this side the
97:50 - worst thing that ever happened to us was
97:51 - Pearl Harbor or 911 which are just like
97:54 - dropping the bucket like no disrespect
97:56 - or like I'm not trying to dismiss the
97:59 - all the Vets out there or all the people
98:01 - who suffered but like that that is like
98:03 - such a a small uh loss of life compared
98:06 - to you know what happened in France
98:08 - during World War II or obviously what
98:10 - happened to the entire Jewish diaspora
98:12 - during World War II or what happened to
98:15 - you know like you know Russia uh sent
98:20 - soldiers often without like you know
98:22 - proper gear like they just
98:24 - basically that's how you know that war
98:26 - was won was Russia just
98:29 - sacrific of their citizens their their
98:31 - young men went and died and over kind of
98:34 - brute forced the war right and if you
98:36 - grew up in Russia during that period so
98:38 - so again I don't want you to think I'm
98:39 - like anti-russia or anything I'm very
98:42 - much anti-putin but I realize that the
98:43 - people who are suffering also include
98:46 - many Russians over there uh and people
98:48 - who live in the former Soviet block uh
98:51 - who are basically been you know under
98:53 - the Spectre so again I I hope nobody in
98:56 - the audience takes issue with me talking
98:57 - about these things uh I'm just like
99:00 - profoundly anti-war but at the same time
99:02 - I realized that you have to have NATO
99:04 - you have to have a defense mechanism
99:06 - everybody has to have nukes because
99:08 - Russia has nukes and China has nukes
99:10 - right the US can't just decommission all
99:11 - their nukes because then we don't like
99:13 - this is just how things work
99:15 - unfortunately and it's
99:17 - sad that's that's well what is the like
99:20 - plan with uh your wife's family cuz you
99:23 - said you want to move back to Europe and
99:24 - be be close to your family what would
99:26 - that look like with the current
99:27 - situation in Ukraine well so we
99:30 - definitely we would be going back to
99:31 - Lava simply because uh we just have
99:34 - everything is more set up there like
99:36 - quite a few friends that we had in
99:38 - Chicago are actually living there so
99:41 - there was uh Chicago is actually one of
99:43 - the biggest laan diasporas in in United
99:45 - States again it's tiny number but
99:48 - compared to like for us it's like a big
99:50 - deal yeah for example like the Polish
99:52 - diaspora and in Chicago is just massive
99:54 - essentially you can go there as a Polish
99:56 - never learn language and you'll do very
99:59 - good actually you know there there's
100:01 - situations where you don't like you can
100:03 - do everything whether that's buying a
100:05 - car apartment finding job or whatever as
100:07 - long as you speak Polish you're good to
100:10 - go Lan's not so much so it's a smaller
100:13 - diaspora but still it's it's pretty huge
100:15 - for United States and essentially quite
100:18 - a few of our friends who we spend time
100:21 - together in Chicago they live in laia
100:22 - right now they live in this awesome city
100:25 - called siga and so so that's one of the
100:27 - things that we have been thinking about
100:29 - like essentially just just moving back
100:31 - there and see where it goes and then her
100:34 - family can can can just basically visit
100:37 - us as much as as they can because coming
100:40 - to United States is is as far as the
100:42 - trip it's it's not something you want to
100:44 - do on like let's say yearly basis in my
100:47 - opinion it's a big trip and also like
100:49 - immigration uh is not trivial I'm not
100:52 - sure it like we would your wife's family
100:54 - be able to come to the US readily or how
100:56 - hard is it for them to visit no I think
100:59 - as far as far as we checked it's super
101:01 - it would be pretty long process yeah so
101:04 - I I think it's easy like if let's say to
101:07 - come here temporarily for like three
101:09 - months or whatever but other than that
101:11 - no it's it's you need to jump through
101:13 - like big amount of Hoops in order to
101:16 - accomplish that and uh um yeah so we're
101:20 - the plan is essentially ltia and uh
101:24 - um to kind of go from there yeah and so
101:28 - one of the great things is that you can
101:30 - work remotely and that you could
101:31 - probably continue to create courses from
101:33 - lva uh so is is that the game plan then
101:36 - over the next 20 years like are you
101:38 - planning to keep a presence in the US
101:39 - like get a house in Florida and then
101:42 - just travel back and forth or what are
101:43 - you planning to do most likely no uh I
101:47 - don't think we're going to be keeping
101:48 - the house over here again things might
101:50 - change this is just you know this is
101:52 - initially where we we we kind of we
101:55 - stand right now but effectively we're I
101:58 - think I mentioned you before that like
102:00 - it's one of those things where me and my
102:02 - wife we have so accustomed to moving
102:04 - from place to place I think in Chicago
102:06 - we moved for like nine places while we
102:09 - were there and then you know coming
102:11 - going to California we moved uh from
102:14 - Sacramento then we were in LA and now we
102:16 - moved to here to Florida and it's one of
102:19 - those things where at this point we're
102:20 - so accustomed to moving that when I said
102:23 - say that yeah we're going to move it
102:24 - doesn't mean that we're going to stay
102:26 - there forever it's going to be most
102:27 - likely one of those things where we're
102:28 - going to go there we'll live there for a
102:30 - little bit and then we're like okay now
102:32 - it's time to go somewhere else it's it's
102:34 - just some one of those things that's
102:35 - like a bug where the moment we get
102:37 - comfortable with the place we're like
102:39 - okay it's time to it's time for a new
102:41 - challenge and and we'll go from there as
102:44 - far as teaching yeah definitely that's
102:46 - something that I'm super stoked about
102:49 - and and really enjoy doing and
102:50 - everything and um yeah just just
102:53 - especially the part of like preparing
102:56 - that code like coming up with those
102:57 - examples and all that so that's that's
102:59 - been I'm super excited about that well
103:02 - John uh I am super grateful that you
103:07 - didn't just stay in construction and uh
103:10 - that you branched out learned new skills
103:11 - went back to school uh that you decided
103:14 - to start recording videos about the
103:16 - things you were learning that you had
103:17 - that teaching bug that bit you so to
103:19 - speak and that you've shared so much
103:21 - wisdom so much insight over the past
103:24 - seven years uh may this just be the very
103:27 - beginning of a long career of teaching
103:29 - for you and I just want to thank you
103:31 - again for sharing so much of your wisdom
103:34 - your developer insights on the fre C
103:36 - Camp Community YouTube channel I want to
103:38 - thank you again for just being a chill
103:40 - human being who makes his courses like
103:43 - very reasonably priced and makes a huge
103:46 - chunk of those courses freely available
103:48 - to the developer community and uh I mean
103:51 - it sounds like your kids are very lucky
103:52 - to have you as a dad and uh like I knew
103:57 - kind of like going into this I'm like
103:59 - this guy is going to be like the
104:01 - chillest like coolest dad type dude that
104:04 - just gets things done and you you're
104:07 - incredibly modest and Incredibly down to
104:09 - earth and it's just been absolute Joy
104:11 - like time just flew I I completely lost
104:13 - track of how long we've been talking we
104:15 - talked for nearly two hours yeah yeah
104:18 - like we discussed all the topics yeah
104:21 - that was that was really nice well I'm
104:23 - super excited to hopefully meet you in
104:24 - person at a conference or if I ever make
104:26 - it out to Europe or something uh if
104:28 - you're ever in Texas hit me up we'll go
104:30 - grab some barbecue um sounds great yeah
104:33 - well everybody uh I've add lot lots of
104:35 - links to uh John and his uh YouTube
104:39 - channel and his work uh I hope you all
104:42 - enjoy learning from him over the coming
104:45 - years and uh learning a whole a lot
104:47 - about typescript nextjs like all the new
104:50 - JavaScript stuff as it comes out you can
