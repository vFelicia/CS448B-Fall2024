00:03 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:06 - with Jessie and today we're going to
00:12 - implement implement some search feature
00:16 - and we've done this way back in project
00:23 - 1 so well almost a year ago now maybe 10
00:31 - months ago we started with project ones
00:35 - it's been a long time so we're going to
00:37 - take a look back at what we did in that
00:39 - project and use that to help us get
00:43 - started on this project so just to give
00:46 - you a quick overview we're going to use
00:49 - the WordPress REST API so we're not
00:53 - going to use graph QL for this and the
00:55 - reason is with the WP graph QL plug-in
01:01 - you can't currently search across
01:04 - different post types and we need to have
01:08 - that so we have a lot of different post
01:11 - types right now in our WordPress
01:14 - installation and I don't really want the
01:18 - user to have to pick a post type to
01:21 - search with that's what we would have to
01:22 - do or potentially we would have to like
01:27 - when a search happened fire off a ton of
01:30 - requests to every single post type with
01:35 - graph QL and then get all the data back
01:38 - from all those requests put it all
01:39 - together and then show it's the user so
01:42 - I think it's gonna be a lot easier to
01:46 - just use the REST API to make the call
01:50 - so there's a plugin that you can use for
01:53 - the rest api that allows you to search
01:56 - multiple post types so that's what we're
02:00 - going to use so we'll check that out if
02:05 - it doesn't make sense right now when we
02:07 - get into it hopefully to make a little
02:08 - bit more sense when you see it
02:12 - and actually we're gonna do this may end
02:16 - up being a two-part show so my work on
02:20 - it today and tomorrow depending on how
02:22 - long it takes so we are gonna have to
02:25 - build a little bit of UI to display the
02:29 - search results so I'll be happy today if
02:32 - we can get just something basic showing
02:35 - up we can always work on the UI later
02:37 - but I just want to make sure that we can
02:39 - make calls to the WordPress API and get
02:43 - data back and just display something
02:48 - even if it's just some titles of the
02:51 - data and we'll have to work out we're
02:57 - gonna have to work out where that data
03:00 - goes like we'll direct them to a page
03:03 - it's yeah it's gonna be a little bit
03:06 - weird and I don't have all I don't have
03:09 - it all figured out yet so hopefully we
03:11 - can come to some type of you know
03:16 - solution as we work through this so
03:20 - before we get started just want to say a
03:23 - few things for those of you who are new
03:25 - maybe just watching for the first time
03:29 - in this stream I'm doing my regular
03:33 - day-to-day work as a front-end developer
03:34 - at a small University so there will be
03:38 - mistakes mistakes are actually probably
03:41 - the unique part about this stream so we
03:45 - do make mistakes but then we work
03:46 - through the mistakes together if you're
03:48 - watching and you have access to the live
03:50 - chat feel free to put any questions that
03:54 - you have in the chat or any suggestions
03:56 - for me I'd take a lot of feedback from
04:00 - you all and a lot of what you tell me
04:04 - ends up in the project if you want to
04:08 - check out the code for the project
04:10 - there's a link in the description and
04:12 - you can check it out everything's on
04:14 - github everything's open-source feel
04:16 - free to take any code from this project
04:18 - and use it in your own projects if
04:20 - you're looking to build up your
04:22 - portfolio and would like some
04:23 - open-source concert
04:24 - Lucian's feel free to to submit a pull
04:30 - request to this project there are issues
04:31 - on this project and on a lot of other
04:35 - projects that we've worked on in the
04:36 - past you can take an issue and submit
04:40 - pull requests on there don't worry if
04:43 - you're not exactly sure what to do just
04:44 - ask me and I'll help you out
04:46 - and that's it that's all that I normally
04:53 - say for this oh one more thing
04:57 - we split up our coding into twenty five
04:59 - minutes sessions so I'll set a timer if
05:01 - you ask a question during that 25
05:03 - minutes I probably won't see it but
05:06 - after that 25 minutes is up I'll take a
05:08 - little break and then I'll answer the
05:10 - questions so please be patient when
05:13 - answering when asking questions I will
05:15 - get to all the questions before I on the
05:17 - stream unless some emergency thing comes
05:20 - up and I have to end it but if you can
05:23 - stick around to the end or you can ask a
05:25 - question and then if you have to go
05:27 - that's cool and you can always watch the
05:28 - recording they are available the
05:31 - recordings are available just a few
05:32 - minutes after the stream ends here on
05:34 - the pre-code camp youtube channel ok so
05:39 - let me switch my screen and I said we're
05:46 - gonna start out in the repository for
05:49 - one of the projects we did a while ago
05:51 - and it's CI reacts and we're going to
05:56 - check out how we implemented a similar
05:59 - search function here and then see if we
06:02 - can use a lot of that code in our
06:05 - project that we'll work on today see
06:11 - pages
06:18 - resources in dependencies okay we
06:32 - actually have this on earth you if you
06:34 - see this this is kind of cool that this
06:36 - pops up but it says there's a
06:37 - vulnerability in one of our dependencies
06:40 - so we are we've already fixed this in a
06:43 - branch
06:44 - we just haven't merged that into master
06:48 - yet so just once you know I'm not
06:51 - ignoring this so this this was actually
06:54 - fixed in another branch before this
06:57 - warning ever even came up but that will
07:03 - be merged into master hopefully soon all
07:08 - right so let me see where you chills
07:14 - okay so what we might want to grab this
07:18 - utility as well let's see how we're
07:23 - doing this and Maki
07:29 - is there we are festive search-term
07:33 - debounce soars nice okay so we have a
07:40 - lot here and this is all I was a little
07:43 - bit afraid that there would have been
07:45 - jQuery in this because we did have a bit
07:47 - of jQuery in this project so it looks
07:49 - like there is no jQuery very happy about
07:52 - that so okay we have a lot of filters
08:00 - and things that are going on I may bring
08:04 - over all of this because eventually I
08:08 - would like to implement some filters in
08:10 - the search but you probably won't get to
08:14 - that today but I'll bring it over anyway
08:16 - and then we can just you'll hook those
08:19 - up into UI elements when we're ready for
08:23 - it make sure whoops I forgot to start
08:27 - the timer okay so I'm starting the timer
08:29 - now and while I'm copying and pasting
08:33 - this I I want to ask you Oh has anyone
08:41 - done anything with blockchain coding so
08:47 - I'm talking about like what crypto
08:49 - currencies are based on so I recently
08:51 - started doing just some really basic
08:54 - tutorial coding with etherium and it
08:59 - seems pretty cool and there's a
09:02 - JavaScript library that lets you work
09:07 - with that in any a JavaScript app so I'm
09:11 - interested if anybody else is into that
09:13 - or done any work with let me know in the
09:16 - in the live chat or if you're watching
09:17 - this later on let me know in the
09:18 - comments if you if you are working with
09:23 - it I'd like to hear what kind of things
09:24 - you're doing with that especially if
09:26 - you're using using it with JavaScript as
09:29 - well alright so I don't need
09:38 - new categories
09:46 - okay I think this is all I need just go
09:52 - over here I was working on the routing
09:55 - so I I said yesterday I would be working
09:58 - on the routing a lot and that's exactly
10:03 - what I'm doing
10:03 - so what we'll do is let's make another I
10:09 - haven't decided exactly how we're gonna
10:12 - display search results so for now I'm
10:14 - gonna make another page component and
10:18 - we'll do everything there I have some
10:21 - ideas where we may not have a separate
10:24 - page but we'll see so let's do a new
10:29 - file and let's call this search a s and
10:35 - let me let's go to here to our untitled
10:43 - page where we just throw things when we
10:45 - need to and we'll grab let's see this
10:53 - just to give us some boilerplate
11:01 - and let's get rid of that side and we'll
11:05 - copy this move this over give us some
11:10 - space okay so we won't need the query
11:17 - we'll get rid of that and we can keep
11:23 - our head header here and you know it
11:30 - actually let's should we keep this it
11:34 - alright let's keep the CSS for now let's
11:37 - get rid of really our Evaro all of our
11:42 - Apollo stuff we don't need the query we
11:47 - don't need with data okay let's get rid
11:58 - of this and oops I put those in the
12:05 - wrong spot
12:17 - and
12:25 - we actually won't need that at least not
12:31 - right now and let's we're gonna probably
12:39 - need to bring in some stuff as well so
12:41 - we'd be copying pasting a bit more let's
12:44 - save that and let's see yeah so we have
12:52 - this get get json utility so let's bring
12:57 - that over and we even be bounced as well
13:02 - so we'll need to bring in low - d bounce
13:14 - okay and maybe we'll use yeah you know
13:26 - what i'm not i think we're using
13:29 - something different yeah we use material
13:33 - you are materialized CSS so i can't use
13:36 - these UI components over again at least
13:39 - not easily all right so let's find this
13:42 - log or this gay json so you chose and
13:55 - fetch okay
14:12 - do we have a utility photo right now I
14:15 - don't think we do okay well let's make
14:21 - that folder then folder and within this
14:33 - folder then we're gonna make a new file
14:35 - and we're gonna call this fetch and we
14:44 - are going to save that now this was made
14:47 - with some earlier versions of a lot of
14:52 - things so hopefully this all still works
14:54 - right
14:57 - and we shouldn't need to do anything
15:02 - else with that for now
15:04 - yes learning the law let's get rid of
15:06 - that okay oh and we need lodash debounce
15:13 - so I just want to verify in our package
15:16 - JSON what we brought over and I am I'm
15:22 - just kind of moving around really fast
15:23 - so please ask questions if you have any
15:25 - questions I'm happy to slow down and
15:29 - kind of review things it kind of in a
15:33 - little bit more depth and explaining
15:34 - what I'm doing and after saying that I'm
15:39 - gonna glanced quickly at the live chat
15:41 - to see if anyone's asking questions
15:43 - about what we're doing right now
15:52 - okay I don't think I see anything about
15:54 - this right now so I do see some
15:56 - responses to what I asked earlier about
15:58 - blockchain stuff and when we take our
16:01 - first break we'll get to that okay so
16:04 - what did we okay so low - debounce cool
16:14 - so low - has a lot of helpers and things
16:18 - you can use but a cool thing is that you
16:21 - don't need to bring in all of low - so
16:23 - in this case we just want debounce so
16:27 - we're just going to bring in D bonds I
16:29 - think that's really awesome that we
16:32 - don't have to pull in you know
16:34 - everything if we're only going to use
16:36 - one thing so we're gonna do yarn add and
16:45 - what else we gonna do sorry I just I was
16:50 - thinking about something I did earlier
16:52 - and I realized I forgot to commit what I
16:55 - was doing before I started the stream it
16:58 - should be okay I just added a few routes
17:00 - in the router so it's not it's not a big
17:04 - deal all right okay so now we should
17:15 - have everything that we need here for
17:16 - these things to work but right now we
17:21 - we're not we really don't have anything
17:24 - going on here was this new JSON
17:28 - [Music]
17:34 - oh okay cool I didn't mean to bring this
17:38 - over but this is actually what we're
17:40 - gonna use here so I'm I'm glad that I
17:42 - brought this over because this needs to
17:48 - go up here so search term is gonna go
17:57 - but let me put this in up here so we can
18:00 - split it apart so for now this is where
18:08 - Vivi - there we go so we're gonna put
18:14 - this in here and then let's do search
18:31 - okay and I had tested this out with a
18:34 - search term Catholic since this is a
18:36 - Catholic school I figured that would
18:37 - give me some results and let me fill in
18:42 - the rest here okay so what what's
18:51 - happening here is that we're using this
18:53 - multiple post type search so I am going
18:59 - to take a second here to explain what's
19:00 - going on so we're using fetch which if
19:08 - you've never used fetch but you have
19:10 - done some work with JavaScript this this
19:13 - is like it's xhr so if you're familiar
19:16 - that or if you've used jQuery what's a
19:20 - clone jQuery AJAX then there's also
19:24 - libraries like Axios that'll help you do
19:27 - these types of requests but basically
19:30 - you can request data without a page
19:32 - refresh it's really nice for you know
19:35 - form submissions or in this case
19:37 - searching so we're gonna make one of
19:42 - those calls and right now we're giving
19:44 - it the URL so this is the the base URL
19:51 - to access the WordPress sorry uh-huh
20:00 - this is the base URL to access the
20:02 - WordPress API and the WordPress ap got
20:06 - API comes standard with WordPress now so
20:09 - it's not a separate plug-in like it used
20:11 - to be if you have WordPress installed
20:13 - you have the API as long as you have one
20:17 - of the newer versions of WordPress so
20:21 - we've installed in WordPress the
20:25 - multiple post type plug-in which allows
20:28 - us to search multiple post types so
20:31 - right now we're doing we're searching of
20:35 - any posts that has a type of page any
20:38 - one that has the type of
20:41 - pages anyone that has the type of chapel
20:45 - pages this is just a test
20:47 - We certainly have way more post types
20:50 - and we're gonna end up with a really
20:52 - long URL here but for now this is enough
20:57 - for us to to at least test things up and
21:03 - see okay so now we're just gonna call
21:08 - get JSON all right what takes us back to
21:10 - that utility that we had which is simply
21:12 - just kind of a wrapper around fetch and
21:15 - it's going to give us back the results
21:17 - in JSON format which is nice we can work
21:21 - well with with JSON so you just pass in
21:25 - that entire URL and then we're saving it
21:29 - to state so now within state we'll have
21:35 - data and we can access data the reason I
21:39 - would pass this I would set this as
21:42 - state is that we'll get a refresh so as
21:45 - soon as state updates will automatically
21:47 - rerender that component so as soon as we
21:51 - get the data back it'll trigger the
21:53 - rerender so this allows us you know to
21:55 - immediately show the results it's kind
22:01 - of nice I I don't know if you've ever
22:04 - done anything like this and tried to
22:06 - work it out with jQuery but there's
22:10 - always issues with like when does the
22:13 - data come and you know if you want to do
22:15 - different things with elements on the
22:17 - page like making sure the timing is
22:20 - right and everything happens so that you
22:21 - don't end up trying to select an element
22:23 - that doesn't even exist yet so with this
22:26 - you know with react we don't worry about
22:28 - the data comes in and then now we do a
22:32 - rerender with this data so some of the
22:37 - other things that we're doing with this
22:39 - is we're doing a debounce search so we
22:41 - don't have a I didn't put in a search
22:44 - input yet but what will happen with
22:47 - search input is it'll run these searches
22:50 - while you're typing so we don't want it
22:53 - to run like
22:54 - constantly that would make way too many
22:56 - calls so what we're doing is just kind
23:01 - of slowing down like how many searches
23:05 - happen and you can check out the lodash
23:10 - debounce page so if you type in lo - D
23:13 - balance you can get all the more
23:15 - information about exactly how that works
23:17 - all cool no way I didn't realize that
23:22 - this would tell me so anyway Visual
23:25 - Studio code is telling me a lot of stuff
23:27 - about debounce and it's telling me the
23:30 - parameters this is insane how did I not
23:33 - notice this stuff before this is so
23:37 - useful Wow Wow it even gives me saying
23:46 - check out this article for more
23:48 - information wow so crazy Wow did anybody
24:01 - else realize that okay so we're getting
24:11 - results results this this might make
24:15 - more sense once we actually put the
24:17 - input in but okay so on submit the first
24:26 - thing we're doing is preventing the
24:28 - default behavior all right which makes
24:29 - sense because we don't normally a submit
24:32 - of a form causes a page refresh but we
24:34 - don't want that to happen right so we
24:37 - got to prevent that and then we're gonna
24:42 - actually start the search so you can see
24:44 - down here we have this fetch search term
24:47 - and if we take the value of that search
24:53 - input which we will make and then we run
24:59 - this right I'm gonna skip over a lot of
25:04 - these filters because we're not gonna
25:05 - use them yet
25:07 - yeah so shows okay so this happens on
25:12 - submit' but then we also call this on
25:19 - while on the on change event so while
25:23 - we're typing this debounce search gets
25:27 - cold and it'll also run this fetch
25:31 - search term and I think I probably would
25:37 - have named this differently if I was
25:39 - doing it again but anyway there's we're
25:41 - not fetching the search term we have the
25:43 - search term we're actually running the
25:45 - search but anyway I'm uh gonna rename it
25:48 - right now all right so I'm gonna check
25:51 - how much time we have in this session so
25:55 - okay cool we have enough time so let's
25:58 - build out a little bit of the the UI so
26:00 - that we can enter in some data and do a
26:03 - search and then get some of that data
26:05 - back okay B I should yeah let me see if
26:15 - I can copy and paste a lot of what we
26:18 - have in in this repository now as I
26:25 - mentioned earlier we're using a totally
26:27 - different UI framework but for testing
26:29 - purposes I can probably just copy and
26:32 - paste some stuff over the styles won't
26:33 - work but it should at least let us do a
26:37 - search and then we can work out how to
26:40 - make it look pretty after we know that
26:42 - it works so pages resources let's check
26:50 - this
26:58 - whereas a search okay here's our form
27:04 - nice okay
27:17 - I think that's all we need
27:22 - cool alright let's paste this in here
27:30 - and let's see how this looks
27:46 - and let me see if I can just go to the
27:50 - search page if it'll let that happen
27:55 - nope okay so our
28:09 - yeah so we're gonna have to change the
28:11 - router a bit to let direct this page
28:15 - where it needs to go hmm I haven't
28:20 - thought about this
28:21 - and we're doing the router before so
28:27 - server da Jas file so let's see see how
28:37 - we need to do this
28:47 - I don't think this will work just like
28:51 - that let's sort the shot whoa what did I
28:58 - do
28:58 - oops you know what I forgot to share the
29:00 - anger uplink today so I'm gonna share
29:04 - that as well
29:08 - and your export you use compose maybe
29:11 - that's just not important maybe
29:21 - okay yeah it's trying to get search
29:24 - pages export kiss Jason was not found
29:30 - and he's so switch
29:53 - hmm
30:05 - all right so
30:33 - compose is not defined just 101 okay
30:51 - oops compose shoot do I need to bring in
30:59 - compose
31:07 - with Apollo I don't think I need to
31:20 - area okay I've forgotten that cool all
31:27 - right so search I wonder if I need this
31:34 - is the most terrible looking search
31:36 - thing I've ever seen
31:37 - all right but we do have the search okay
31:41 - so let's let's console.log our data so
31:55 - let's console.log this state data whoops
32:11 - what am i doing this state data
32:21 - so let's make sure our console is open
32:34 - okay so fetch failed loading
32:43 - okay but it did try to search for the
33:43 - okay
33:47 - so why is this not working
34:09 - interesting well you're not getting
34:12 - anything but this works all right so our
34:20 - our strain to search isn't working so
34:23 - that's what we'll do
34:25 - right after a five minute timer here and
34:29 - let me scroll up and answer as many
34:32 - questions as I can and let's see we have
34:36 - like double the viewers that we had the
34:39 - last time I checked so welcome everyone
34:41 - if you're joining me before I or after I
34:45 - did the the intro so we're gonna do five
34:47 - minutes of question answer then we'll go
34:49 - back into another 25-minute session of
34:51 - coding and if you happen to missed
34:55 - anything don't worry you can always
34:58 - watch the recording and and figure out
35:00 - what you know what we did at the
35:01 - beginning
35:03 - Fidel's says will you use the latest
35:06 - features of reacts such as fragment and
35:08 - report or anything for the latest you
35:10 - know what I try to use the latest
35:11 - features like number one if if I hear
35:14 - about them and I read about them when
35:16 - they first come out which I don't always
35:17 - have time to do but I try and then if
35:21 - there's an opportunity to use them in
35:23 - the project I try to so today probably
35:26 - won't be using any of those but you know
35:29 - we have done that in in previous streams
35:33 - sometimes we've we usually update to
35:36 - newer new versions of things immediately
35:38 - and try out you know whatever new stuff
35:42 - makes sense to try out in our projects
35:49 - we have Renato says good afternoon from
35:53 - Brazil and noble savage commented before
36:00 - the stream even started beard with lots
36:02 - of exclamation points and the the bot
36:04 - the bot banned them for five seconds for
36:07 - it but yes my beard is getting a little
36:13 - bit bushier
36:18 - and I knew yesterday who was it Michael
36:21 - mention that in the last video that I
36:23 - did on my channel you can see all the
36:26 - gray hair in my beard a lot so is that
36:29 - you did anybody watch that video is it
36:31 - really bad with the gray hair let me
36:35 - know I mean I I'm okay I'm not worried
36:38 - about my gray hair I worry more about
36:40 - the lack of hair up here than the gray
36:42 - hair down here my kids told me yesterday
36:44 - that I have a lot of hair except on my
36:48 - head so I immediately told my Amazon
36:52 - echo I said Alexa buy Rogaine and let
36:55 - that's like a medicine that's supposed
36:57 - to help you grow hey I didn't really buy
37:00 - it but I was tempted to let's see Nicki
37:06 - says this bracket syntax for react
37:08 - fragments work and create react app yet
37:11 - or do you have to write react off
37:12 - fragment YouTube chat won't let me post
37:14 - the actual syntax I don't know I don't
37:19 - know that we did we try it and create
37:22 - react app yet I don't think we tried it
37:26 - and create react app Nicki says asks
37:37 - about so I was talking about a theory
37:38 - I'm coding and so it's like blockchain
37:41 - and the saying are you using a special
37:44 - language just even gritter has a course
37:49 - on udemy for blockchain aetherium coding
37:51 - so yeah the language
37:53 - let me scroll over and see what language
37:55 - it was I don't even remember no shoot
38:00 - all right so the the tutorial that I was
38:06 - doing is called crypto zombies
38:08 - so it's crypto zombies io which it just
38:12 - seemed kind of fun like it's kind of
38:14 - like a game and you learn as you build
38:16 - out these characters in the game so
38:19 - that's what I'm using so if anybody's
38:21 - interested in doing that with me check
38:24 - out crypto zombies dot IO and so so far
38:30 - I'm only done with like the first
38:32 - like course so I've created one zombie
38:36 - but it was kind of cool it's pretty easy
38:38 - to learn it's definitely a little bit
38:41 - more rigid than JavaScript like you have
38:43 - to define a lot more like beforehand but
38:49 - it's not too hard if you already know
38:52 - about JavaScript you'd be able to fly
38:54 - through you know the first lesson I did
38:56 - the first lesson this like this morning
38:58 - and I don't like less than a half an
39:00 - hour
39:08 - ABI shakes his basic blockchain here as
39:10 - well
39:11 - using javascript not something that I
39:14 - really worked on we'd love to contribute
39:15 - though cool David asked what tutorial
39:18 - was going through so I guess I just
39:20 - answered that solidity that's it
39:24 - Nicki's Nikki has it the name of the
39:26 - language is solidity so that's what I've
39:29 - been been learning all right so the
39:36 - timer's let me write down where I got to
39:39 - in the chat which may be about halfway
39:43 - through the chat so didn't do that low
39:46 - and getting through but we'll get to the
39:49 - rest of it after the next Pomodoro
39:53 - session
40:05 - okay so what are we doing okay this
40:09 - doesn't work let's figure out why this
40:11 - doesn't work so I am going to go over to
40:15 - the plugins that I have in WordPress and
40:19 - make sure that that plug-in is there and
40:21 - it's activated it is don't you eat you
40:25 - folks if you alright so let's take this
40:28 - down multiple post type
40:44 - all right I am going to copy and paste
40:47 - the example
41:18 - and let me verify that that is the right
41:21 - IPA just 104 two three six four one five
41:25 - nine okay that is the right IP slug
41:31 - about me let's take this just say about
41:37 - let's try the example was the exemplar
41:41 - Catholic and we're not gonna do page
41:47 - let's do type
41:58 - yeah we should be able to do tape
42:06 - the shy major let me bring up do I have
42:14 - the post type so I don't think I have
42:16 - them up I have that custom plug-in and
42:24 - that tells me what all my types are so
42:28 - on my other screen I'm going to bring up
42:30 - that custom plugin so I can just view
42:34 - what types we have make sure I get the
42:36 - the correct names so we
42:45 - so you shall arrest directories so we do
42:51 - the directories for rest and what's the
42:58 - next thing news okay so those are types
43:10 - that we do have
43:33 - alright this is not good this did work
43:41 - alright I actually have let me pull this
43:44 - over just to show you so I tested this
43:48 - out earlier and it did work so oh that's
43:56 - what's different it's saying slug here
44:00 - but we did search so let me change this
44:08 - there we go ok so if we do search it
44:14 - works alright let's go back to our code
44:17 - and see where I messed this up
44:18 - so search alright so in here it actually
44:25 - it does work let's verify let me refresh
44:30 - that ok so this should work and this was
44:33 - the same let me make sure I didn't mess
44:35 - anything up actually I could check the
44:39 - this this will show us what we actually
44:41 - used HTTP colon slash slash
44:53 - question mark search and type equals
45:03 - pose
45:16 - okay all right so it looks like we have
45:19 - the right the right thing being searched
45:21 - for maybe actually I think I have an
45:33 - idea
46:06 - I mean I'm gonna check the live chat see
46:10 - what y'all think
46:35 - well yeah a whole conversation is going
46:38 - on in other languages all right Michael
46:48 - Creole says check search is 32 so it's
46:54 - line 32
46:55 - [Music]
47:07 - so it's this D bounced search cancel
47:34 - hmm
47:38 - okay all right so Michael said checking
47:41 - the error log
47:51 - let me get rid of this
48:28 - then we try this before copying it in
48:32 - there we didn't get anything okay so
48:33 - maybe there is something wrong with this
48:37 - all right let me check them right next
48:43 - to each other multiple posts that
48:45 - question works it was
49:03 - that's crazy they're the same
49:17 - all right let me do this I'm gonna copy
49:21 - and paste this right here
49:35 - so it is going to search this let me
49:42 - save it just to see what we can get here
49:46 - so when we hit search
50:02 - okay
50:58 - all right what am I
51:34 - oh there is something different right
51:41 - yeah there's something different between
51:43 - the two of these what is it
51:51 - alright I'm checking the live chat now
51:56 - you have an extra s Chappell page it may
52:06 - mayor that you're right I do have the
52:12 - extra s but it looks like it looks like
52:21 - it works either way of those so I I mean
52:23 - at least in the browser it could work
52:26 - with or without the S yeah it works with
52:32 - or without the S okay so
52:44 - all right here's what I should be able
52:47 - to do I should be able to figure out at
52:49 - what point it stops being the same with
52:53 - like this there we go there it is
53:02 - admissions page instead of admissions
53:06 - pages let's see which one is admissions
53:11 - page all right so let's see
53:37 - come on
54:01 - ok so now we at least know that our our
54:06 - string here for the URL it does work in
54:11 - the browser so it's just not working
54:18 - here all right okay so yeah just to
54:29 - verify oops let's remove this yep and
54:39 - they are the same now okay so let's take
54:44 - this up and take this out well actually
54:48 - let me let me just go back there we are
54:53 - and admissions pages and chapel I'm an
54:59 - admissions page and Chapel page okay
55:13 - let's see
55:20 - all right cool hey Harsha what's up
55:29 - we're just get chase on defined let's
55:34 - see
55:35 - so get JSON we're bringing it in up here
55:38 - in utils folder so let's bring it up
55:54 - area get JSON
56:20 - you import isomorphic fetch is the Ito's
56:26 - fetch import correct yeah I don't all
56:32 - right let's let me look at this Aragon
56:35 - okay so we are attempting to make a get
56:39 - request right
57:19 - the import fetch from isomorphic fetch
58:22 - Narsingh expand get function are
58:27 - let me let me give you the the end rot
58:31 - link to in case you wanna check that out
60:58 - hey we got it to work
61:07 - okay cool
61:16 - alright let's put some of this data in
61:17 - here
61:50 - title rendered alright let's try to get
61:54 - a title rendered for each of these nikki
62:00 - says so what was the Tet the fix I alts
62:03 - have for a second I don't even know I
62:05 - don't know what I I think the problem
62:09 - was I kept searching for just some
62:11 - nonsense and so I was getting back an
62:14 - empty array and then when I search for a
62:19 - term that I knew would give a result
62:22 - then I got a result so I could let me
62:25 - yeah that was fetch failed fetch failed
62:34 - yeah actually it keeps telling me it
62:40 - failed no matter what but if you look at
62:46 - the network I get status 200 okay
62:51 - success true I don't I don't know what's
62:57 - happening here
63:13 - III don't understand all right well
63:18 - let's just display a little bit of this
63:20 - quickly so I don't have much time in
63:24 - this session so let me just go to go
63:30 - here and say oops um I don't need that
63:41 - I'm in the layout so let's see
64:31 - all right so I'm not talking cuz I'm
64:34 - just trying to get this done before the
64:36 - timer comes up so key items how to
64:40 - render okay
65:05 - okay cool there we go all right it works
65:11 - all right so I can't believe I got that
65:14 - in before the time ran out all right so
65:16 - here's here's what I did I just said if
65:21 - this state data exists then I want you
65:24 - to map over all the items so remember
65:27 - this state data is an array of objects
65:31 - so I want you to map over everything and
65:38 - then we just use an arrow function so
65:42 - it's going to be inside this map so for
65:44 - each item that's gonna represent a
65:47 - different object so I just did a div I
65:51 - put a key on there or else react
65:53 - complains that there's no key so I just
65:56 - use the ID and then since I'm used to
65:58 - using the WordPress API I knew exactly
66:00 - where this was which which helped so
66:02 - item title rendered gave us the data we
66:06 - needed so now when we search we get the
66:10 - titles so let's try it out with a
66:11 - different search term Chappell awesome
66:16 - so Chappell and students great so we're
66:25 - getting different search items based on
66:33 - that why are we only always getting ten
66:38 - all right I'll have to work on that but
66:42 - basically it worked we have a search
66:44 - function now we can't do that much with
66:47 - it but we have it and it works so
66:50 - awesome so now let me go back to where I
66:55 - was in the live chat where I left off
66:57 - that last time and I'm gonna go through
67:06 - I'm gonna go through all the rest of the
67:08 - questions mr. Tommy yeah I'm gonna go
67:11 - through all the rest if you have a
67:12 - question or comment please put in the
67:15 - live chat now and I will I'll get to
67:18 - everything in the live chat so the
67:20 - coding portion of this is pretty much
67:22 - over
67:22 - we depending on what questions are we
67:24 - may go back to the code and do a thing
67:26 - or two but for the most we're not gonna
67:28 - do a whole other point or a session of
67:30 - coding maybe tomorrow we'll go back to
67:34 - this and build out the UI and build out
67:37 - some of those filtering options because
67:39 - I want you to be able to be fill to
67:40 - filter this stuff like you're at
67:42 - amazon.com right
67:45 - I want users to be able to just narrowly
67:47 - filter everything to get exactly what
67:50 - they want so actually not I think about
67:55 - it that might be more than one more
67:57 - stream to make all that happen but about
68:00 - will probably work on it frog for the
68:03 - rest of the week and that's something
68:04 - else more important comes up Alexi says
68:11 - hello Jesse are you leveling up as a
68:13 - programmer I think I am I think I'm
68:17 - learning more every day so that's all we
68:21 - can do right just try to keep learning
68:23 - and and keep going what we can so yeah I
68:29 - guess I'm leveling up slowly but surely
68:31 - I don't know but you all let me know
68:35 - does it seem like I'm a better
68:36 - programmer now then a few months ago or
68:40 - or have I gone downhill in my past my
68:43 - prime yet Alexi says you look like a
68:48 - wizard with that beard cool I will I
68:51 - take that as a compliment I like the
68:54 - there's something relaxing about just
68:57 - being able to just stroke your beard
68:59 - like this my wife thinks it's weird she
69:03 - just laughs at me but it's fine and it
69:08 - does protect your face a little bit from
69:10 - the cold and from babies who try to grab
69:12 - your face and give you like battle scars
69:15 - like this one they go to grab your face
69:18 - instead they get a handful of beard so
69:20 - it's definitely functional as well as
69:23 - fashionable every shake says where you
69:34 - copying code from sorry I haven't been
69:36 - that involved with this whole process in
69:37 - the beginning oh okay
69:39 - Oh Annie he answered it already it's a
69:42 - good answer so Nicky says he's taking
69:43 - the code from a previous project he's
69:45 - done it's C I react on github yeah that
69:49 - is so on if you wanted to check out the
69:51 - project we are copying things from at
69:53 - the beginning it's CI - react on the
69:57 - github repository that we work from so
70:00 - it's it's a what's it called
70:03 - organization repository so fu fu s -
70:07 - marcom M AR CLM is the repository so my
70:11 - personal github is separate from that
70:15 - although I'm the the owner of the
70:17 - repository I guess yeah but you check
70:21 - out there and it's also project one in
70:24 - our series of videos so if you want to
70:26 - watch any of the videos when we first
70:28 - implemented that search function you
70:31 - could go back and check that out trying
70:34 - to think not all of my videos are titled
70:38 - well but I think I did put descriptive
70:42 - titles for that first project
70:50 - Aniki asks how does isomorphic fetch
70:53 - differ from regular fetch so isomorphic
70:57 - fetch so regular fetch works in the
70:59 - browser I mean assuming you have a newer
71:02 - browser where you can polyfill it
71:04 - isomorphic fetch works in on the server
71:08 - with with node so that's why we're using
71:13 - isomorphic fetch as well in kind of
71:17 - thing hmm so we probably didn't need to
71:25 - use it here because this is all
71:27 - happening client-side not server-side
71:29 - but the project where I copied it from
71:31 - we were actually making client and
71:34 - server-side calls not for the search but
71:36 - for loading some other data so that's
71:39 - why it was using isomorphic fetch so we
71:41 - didn't really need to do that but I mean
71:46 - it's nice to have that utility if we do
71:48 - need to use it you know we can use it
71:51 - server-side as well since we're using
71:52 - next we can use it in inside that that
71:57 - props would it lose that function called
72:00 - I can't remember is it props something
72:07 - what is it called
72:14 - and we're not using it here or we using
72:16 - this get initial props function that
72:20 - comes with neck so things in here will
72:22 - run server side and client side
72:36 - Raphael says good afternoon from
72:38 - Venezuela welcome thanks for watching
72:51 - Victoria says where is the past video
72:58 - tutorial help ok so we have a lot of
73:03 - other videos so there's a playlist on
73:07 - the free code camp YouTube channel
73:09 - called live coding with Jesse that has
73:11 - all the videos it's a lot of videos
73:14 - right now so I'm not really sure how
73:18 - you'd want to go about watching them I
73:23 - would say maybe just check out the
73:26 - titles and watch one of the videos that
73:27 - seems interesting to you based on the
73:30 - title also people have told me that it
73:35 - helps to watch the video at like 2 times
73:38 - speed and then just to slow it down if
73:41 - there's something you're really
73:42 - interested in and I'll recommend that I
73:44 - tried it as well I think the videos when
73:47 - you're watching the recording are much
73:48 - better at a faster speed it makes me
73:52 - look better because I type really fast
73:54 - and I talk really fast
73:56 - if you've set it on a faster speed
74:03 - let's see John says fetch and react is
74:09 - so much easier than jQuery AJAX call
74:11 - yeah I agree I think fetch is the
74:14 - easiest way to make Network requests
74:22 - Abhishek says fetch is polyfill for
74:25 - browsers which don't have fetch function
74:28 - it adds fetch function to your browser
74:30 - dice amorphic to your browser period
74:34 - isomorphic is implementation of fetch
74:36 - for both no GS and browser on top of the
74:38 - technical alright yeah exactly
74:40 - so Abhishek was answering the question
74:43 - about the difference between regular
74:45 - fetch and isomorphic fetch so that's
74:46 - exactly right the crap Pathan says I
74:54 - just got here what's so amazing Visual
74:59 - Studio code is amazing when what it
75:03 - where was it
75:05 - with debounce so if I hover over
75:09 - debounce
75:10 - it gives me all this information about
75:13 - the bounce it lets me know what it does
75:18 - and then it also says it recommends an
75:21 - article for me to get more information
75:24 - it gives me all the parameters that I
75:28 - could possibly use and it describes what
75:30 - they do it's really cool right it's
75:34 - right there I mean normally I just look
75:37 - it up on my other screen but being right
75:41 - there is really awesome
75:50 - michael says isn't that up to the author
75:53 - of the extension to write I'm guessing
75:55 - that that is the case I mean I I don't I
75:59 - really don't think Visual Studio code is
76:02 - going out and like searching for this so
76:03 - I'd imagine that's the case but either
76:08 - way it's really cool that this pops up
76:10 - and if it is the the author of this
76:14 - extension then good job on that thank
76:18 - you
76:18 - that's awesome feature John says with
76:24 - that revelation of amazing code feedback
76:26 - in BS code it looks like I may change my
76:28 - editor yeah I mean that that's a really
76:32 - nice feature alright was so there's a
76:42 - lot of conversation back and forth in a
76:45 - different alphabet than I use so I'm not
76:48 - gonna try to translate all of that if
76:50 - anybody wants to if any of those
76:55 - questions were directed to me then let
76:59 - me know but it's just a lot to go
77:02 - through and translate right now so I'm
77:03 - not I'm not gonna do that on the stream
77:05 - I might go after the stream and
77:06 - translate everything
77:26 - Michael earlier I mentioned that Michael
77:28 - had said that you could see my gray hair
77:30 - and my the latest video so I I didn't
77:33 - think I've talked about I didn't mention
77:35 - with the video was so I just went on an
77:36 - interview I interviewed for a position
77:39 - as a full-stack engineer and I did a
77:42 - video on my own YouTube channel which is
77:44 - linked in the description just
77:46 - explaining what the interview was like
77:49 - and then giving some of my thoughts and
77:52 - advice on coding interviews so if you're
77:56 - interested please check that video out
77:58 - and Michael says it wasn't as bad as or
78:03 - no wasn't it Michael says it was only a
78:05 - hair or two Nicky says not as bad as I
78:09 - thought was quite disappointed about
78:10 - that yeah so I don't have that much gray
78:12 - hair you can't really tell in these
78:15 - videos the resolutions not as high but
78:17 - the other video I did was a better
78:20 - camera and so you
78:22 - I guess you could tell they said the
78:28 - grey hair doesn't bother me then less
78:31 - hair on my head bothers me a lot more
78:40 - okay John says that the new bracket
78:43 - syntax for fragments does not yet work
78:45 - and create react okay good to know so I
78:49 - do have some projects that I haven't
78:52 - create react apps some of them we have
78:54 - using next so that's just something
78:57 - we're going to have to keep in mind if
79:00 - we use that to make sure we we think
79:02 - about okay what what are we using with
79:04 - this project will it work okay
79:09 - curious truth asks how much time should
79:12 - I put into CSS early on I actually
79:15 - really dislike it so I'm really having
79:17 - to force myself to work with it and
79:19 - inevitably end up procrastinating I
79:22 - would say and I'm gonna read out some of
79:27 - the answers as well but that others have
79:30 - given but I would say this depending on
79:33 - what you want to do CSS might not be
79:37 - that important for you if you really
79:39 - want to be a front-end developer you are
79:41 - gonna didn't need to know some CSS but
79:44 - you can get away with using some
79:46 - frameworks and focus more on JavaScript
79:50 - and you'll be okay with that and
79:53 - depending on where you work you may be
79:55 - able to get away with that even more if
79:59 - you want to do more of like back-end or
80:02 - even be like full stack with a back-end
80:04 - focus then you're probably safe to skip
80:09 - over a lot of CSS stuff and just do
80:11 - focus more on JavaScript so it just kind
80:15 - of depends on how much friend do you
80:18 - want to do and then what would job so I
80:25 - guess right now if CSS is holding you
80:27 - back from learning more you're fine to
80:31 - just focus more on JavaScript but if you
80:34 - start to have to have a job that you
80:37 - really wants and you need to use it of
80:39 - course you're gonna have to learn that
80:40 - but not every developer job are you even
80:43 - going to need to use CSS that much if
80:45 - they already have a style guide or
80:48 - certain framework that they use you may
80:50 - not even have a
80:51 - freedom to do very much with CSS so it
80:54 - may not be a big deal depending on who
80:56 - else you have on your team
80:58 - so if you if you're gonna do like
80:59 - freelance stuff and you're going to be
81:01 - expected to do everything on a project
81:03 - then you're gonna need to know CSS so in
81:06 - anyway hopefully that's a decent answer
81:09 - let's see what what everyone else said
81:13 - John says it depends on your goals what
81:16 - kind of developer you want to be CSS as
81:18 - part of the whole design and function
81:20 - process pretty important to have a
81:21 - fairly good understanding okay so also
81:24 - good answer
81:36 - okay so old sauce is explained a little
81:39 - bit about what what they are talking
81:41 - about and I wonder
81:46 - I'm not exactly sure what language that
81:48 - is like I don't want to know now but
81:57 - basically it was just someone asking
82:00 - about like what I was talking about so
82:02 - far okay it's Russian so it looked like
82:09 - Russian
82:28 - hm
82:41 - see
82:46 - Michael Michael put like a little like
82:50 - laughing crying emoji saying we'll be
82:52 - will rebuild Amazon search tomorrow yeah
82:55 - I didn't I didn't realize that when I
82:58 - said it but you're right that does sound
82:59 - ridiculous that I'm gonna do it just
83:01 - like Amazon say I'm not it wasn't my
83:07 - intention
83:08 - Amazon search is way too advanced for
83:11 - what we're gonna do it but we're we're
83:13 - gonna try to make our search more like
83:16 - Amazon search let's see
83:33 - hard should ask if I can test messaging
83:36 - in JavaScript AF which is one of our
83:40 - side projects yeah I could test the
83:43 - messaging and if Michael says the day
83:52 - after that we'll refine Google's
83:53 - algorithm alright jr. says hello from
84:03 - Africa from Senegal I love your live
84:06 - coding Oh awesome thanks for saying that
84:09 - thanks for watching that means a lot
84:12 - when when you all say things like that I
84:15 - appreciate it
84:31 - oh it's so harsh it is saying that most
84:35 - mature packages right those like this
84:38 - kind of thing now if it'll so that's
84:42 - really cool I'm gonna have to kind of
84:46 - try to do this more and hover over
84:48 - things and just see like what would
84:51 - extra info I think this is really useful
84:54 - it may be able to get like extra
84:56 - functionality out of things whereas
84:57 - normally I would just use what I I know
84:59 - and wouldn't take the extra time to look
85:03 - it up you know but this is so convenient
85:05 - you know I may be able to find a
85:08 - parameter that may give me a something
85:10 - better that's cool I like that world
85:16 - says you're only like 30 why do you have
85:18 - gray hairs already I don't know I'm 32 I
85:22 - don't know why like I'm losing my hair
85:24 - on the top and I have gray hair and my
85:27 - beard like what is I don't know what
85:30 - what's wrong with that it's like anyway
85:41 - yeah maybe it's the kids I do have four
85:44 - kids and so maybe maybe they cause my
85:49 - grade you know what it was I used to
85:51 - teach high school that's what did I'm
85:54 - convinced that's what did it I taught
85:56 - high school for like almost four years
86:00 - that must be it does that is teaching
86:06 - high school students is super stressful
86:11 - it's so stressful so I'm gonna blame it
86:18 - on that I mean maybe I could blame it on
86:24 - semicolons but now that I use you know
86:28 - standard style I don't have semicolons
86:31 - so I'm a lot more relaxed
86:36 - all right well I have made it to the end
86:40 - of the live chat horseshit I see I was
86:43 - just reminding me to test the messaging
86:45 - I will I will do my best to test the
86:49 - messenger okay so I'll be back tomorrow
86:56 - I don't think we have not we I don't
87:01 - think I have any meetings going on
87:03 - tomorrow so should be able to stream at
87:05 - the normal time and we'll be working on
87:07 - this search again and refining it a bit
87:10 - in the meantime I'm just going to be
87:12 - adding new things to our routing
87:14 - functions so you get more of the site
87:16 - accessible from the proper URLs and I'll
87:22 - be working on making sure all the data
87:24 - is formatted correctly in WordPress or
87:27 - as correctly as we can get it at this
87:29 - point so in the meantime if you have any
87:33 - questions you can always reach out to me
