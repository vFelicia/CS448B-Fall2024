00:03 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:05 - with jesse i'm jesse and today we're
00:08 - going to get to work on this main
00:11 - website that we've been working on with
00:13 - react
00:14 - and we're pulling data from the
00:16 - wordpress api
00:19 - we're using graphql the wp graphql
00:21 - plugin we're going to pull it in
00:24 - to
00:25 - our react site using
00:28 - apollo and we're going to make some
00:31 - components
00:32 - and we need to set up some custom routes
00:34 - we are using next.js so they have some
00:36 - routing built in but we need a little
00:38 - bit more functionality
00:40 - which is cool because they've built next
00:42 - in such a way that it's really easy to
00:44 - add additional routing
00:46 - features
00:47 - if you need to
00:49 - and we always end up needing to i don't
00:51 - know i don't remember a project where we
00:53 - didn't need to do that
00:57 - all um
00:58 - hey everyone i see some of you in the
01:00 - live chat now
01:04 - uh let's see
01:05 - oh one question before we start
01:09 - i've been thinking
01:10 - about um it's 9am or just it is
01:15 - no it's not 9am where i'm at it's uh 12
01:18 - noon
01:19 - so 12pm where i am so i'm in uh united
01:22 - states uh like east coast time so
01:25 - eastern time
01:26 - so anyway i have a question i think i
01:28 - brought this up a while ago in the
01:30 - stream but i've been thinking about
01:31 - doing again
01:33 - uh maybe like i'm gonna put some info
01:35 - somewhere i don't know if it'll be on my
01:36 - website or wherever i'll put it but it's
01:38 - basically just going to have some
01:40 - referral codes for products that i use
01:42 - or ways to donate
01:44 - i just wanted to throw it out there to
01:46 - see
01:47 - do you all think this is an okay thing
01:48 - to do or is this like in bad taste
01:52 - does it seem
01:55 - like i i just don't want to
01:57 - i'm doing this stuff
01:58 - you know for free like i want to help
02:00 - you all out and you all already helped
02:02 - me out a lot
02:04 - so i don't want to seem like
02:06 - i'm begging for donations or anything
02:08 - like that
02:10 - um
02:11 - and it's like with the referral codes a
02:13 - lot of them
02:14 - you know whoever uses it will get some
02:17 - something as well as me so i mean let me
02:20 - just show you i guess what i have
02:23 - and you let me know if it seems
02:27 - in bad taste or if it'd be okay
02:29 - i'll make it a bit bigger
02:31 - so like this is what i'm thinking so
02:35 - like coinbase is where i do my uh like
02:38 - crypto trading and stuff so
02:41 - you get 10 bucks on
02:42 - on coinbase
02:44 - these are my wallets for the different
02:46 - coins that i have um i get closed
02:48 - through trunk club so i was gonna put
02:50 - the link there uh you get
02:53 - i don't remember what you get on trunk
02:54 - club i haven't used it in a while like
02:56 - digitalocean you'll get a 10 credit if
02:58 - you use that and
03:00 - i think i get 10 or i can't remember
03:03 - what i get siteground i host some sites
03:05 - there as well
03:06 - um trello
03:09 - uh i think you get like three months of
03:12 - trellos like
03:13 - paid plan
03:15 - so anyway these are all the ones i could
03:18 - just think of
03:19 - um
03:20 - they're probably
03:23 - probably might might be able to do more
03:25 - but anyway let me know in the live chat
03:27 - which you think if you're watching this
03:29 - later let me know in the uh in the
03:32 - comments
03:34 - because i don't i don't want to do
03:35 - anything that would get like hurt the
03:36 - stream
03:37 - so
03:39 - i'm not planning on getting rich off of
03:41 - this i was just
03:43 - you know throwing it out there
03:49 - let's see
03:52 - all right it looks like
03:56 - alright looks like uh at least a few of
03:59 - you think that that's cool to do so uh
04:01 - maybe i'll it's not a high priority
04:03 - right now but i'll get that up somewhere
04:06 - um someone asked
04:08 - larry asked what my website is
04:11 - it's jesseweigle.com but i haven't
04:13 - updated it in like five years
04:15 - so
04:17 - uh now i take that back i did do a
04:19 - slight content update
04:22 - like three years ago or two and a half
04:24 - years ago but the site was actually
04:26 - built at least five years ago
04:29 - so it needs updated i just haven't
04:31 - decided what direction i want to go with
04:33 - it should it be a straight portfolio
04:35 - should it be a blog
04:37 - um
04:38 - i don't know
04:39 - but that probably would be a good place
04:41 - to put stuff like this uh i could maybe
04:44 - put it somewhere in my youtube channel
04:46 - as well i'm definitely not gonna put it
04:48 - anywhere in the free code camp channel
04:50 - because i i want
04:52 - you know donations or anything to go to
04:54 - free code camp and not to me
04:57 - on on that channel so anyway thank you
04:59 - all for um
05:01 - for giving me feedback on that i
05:03 - appreciate it
05:04 - uh
05:09 - okay sergio does have an important
05:11 - question i'm gonna adjust now before we
05:12 - get started uh sergio says i'm following
05:15 - uh project five which is this project um
05:18 - day three
05:20 - so so far this project is with material
05:23 - react material ui next or gatsby so
05:27 - we ended up going with next i know early
05:29 - on in the project i had said i thought
05:31 - it would be cool to develop both
05:33 - uh with gatsby and material ui and then
05:36 - compare
05:38 - uh i just
05:40 - i still think it would be cool to do
05:41 - that but we need to get the site
05:43 - launched
05:44 - in time
05:45 - and
05:46 - i think i'm i'm gonna need all the time
05:48 - i can get so we decided not to do that i
05:51 - still left the branch open for gatsby in
05:54 - case anybody loves gatsby and really
05:56 - wanted to try to build some stuff out in
05:57 - gatsby
05:58 - that's that's still an option and i'll
06:00 - still show it on the stream if somebody
06:03 - really wanted to but we ended up going
06:06 - with with next
06:09 - okay
06:14 - okay um nikki has a good point
06:18 - it says
06:19 - that that stuff meaning the referral
06:21 - codes and things are fine as long as you
06:23 - don't start off every video with a buy
06:24 - my stuff plug oh yeah i definitely won't
06:27 - i'll probably like if i do it
06:30 - i'll just mention it one time
06:33 - say like hey i did this
06:35 - here it is and i won't talk about it
06:37 - again
06:37 - [Music]
06:39 - uh on free code camp i won't talk about
06:41 - it maybe i'll talk about it
06:43 - on my channel too so
06:45 - uh we'll see but yeah i definitely don't
06:47 - want to start off with that i think that
06:49 - i don't know it just
06:52 - like i don't i don't have a problem when
06:54 - other people do it i guess you know you
06:55 - gotta
06:57 - you know people are giving their time to
06:59 - make videos so why why not you know be
07:01 - compensated for it but i just kind of
07:03 - don't want it to be
07:05 - i don't know like that for me
07:09 - see
07:17 - oh christian um
07:19 - is asking what is this been a subscriber
07:21 - for a while but i don't know what this
07:22 - live thing is all right so
07:25 - i'm at work
07:26 - and i am a front-end developer and i'm
07:28 - working on a real project that i have to
07:30 - do for work so
07:33 - whatever i need to do in a particular
07:35 - day i just share you know an hour or two
07:37 - of my work and then i answer any
07:39 - questions along the way uh that you
07:41 - might have
07:42 - so
07:44 - and then we collaborate so you all have
07:47 - a chance to add code if you'd like
07:49 - and
07:52 - yeah so that's pretty much what the
07:53 - stream is i was just kind of hoping that
07:55 - people would see what my day-to-day like
07:57 - life is like as a developer
08:00 - and
08:00 - see me make mistakes and try to recover
08:03 - from that
08:04 - so
08:05 - anyway so stick around for a little bit
08:07 - we're about to start some coding now
08:08 - just to kind of see you know how we do
08:10 - this i usually hold off and do the
08:12 - questions answer questions towards the
08:14 - end
08:15 - but
08:17 - if you don't if you can't stick around
08:19 - right now then you know maybe
08:21 - you can always watch the recording later
08:24 - but if you do watch it live it's cool
08:25 - because you can actually ask questions
08:27 - and comment and kind of interact with
08:29 - everyone in the live chat and with me
08:33 - all right
08:38 - uh louise again says uh
08:40 - think about creating a udemy course
08:44 - yeah you know what i
08:46 - i'm still thinking about doing that i
08:48 - just
08:49 - i don't have a lot of time right now
08:50 - maybe after we get this site launched
08:52 - then i can have a little bit of time for
08:55 - that
08:56 - uh
08:58 - coding and caffeine is here hey i got
09:00 - that covered i got my g fuel and
09:04 - i have
09:05 - a half of a mug of lukewarm coffee that
09:07 - is a day old
09:08 - so
09:11 - i got all the caffeine i need
09:13 - all right let's get started
09:17 - let me show you
09:19 - let's get the site up here i have ngrok
09:22 - running
09:24 - i never turned it off from yesterday
09:26 - so let me paste that in the live chat
09:28 - here for you all if you click on this
09:31 - link that i just put in the live chat
09:33 - that'll take you to the website that's
09:36 - running locally on my machine
09:38 - and you can inspect it in dev tools and
09:41 - you know navigate to different pages
09:42 - whatever you want
09:45 - and
09:47 - oops i was migrating a lot of stuff over
09:49 - so
09:50 - just to give you a heads up i've added a
09:52 - few more custom post types
09:54 - so we have custom post types now in the
09:56 - wordpress installation for
09:59 - directories so or i'm sorry departments
10:03 - so faculty departments we have ones for
10:05 - majors which we've had the majors in
10:07 - there for a while
10:08 - uh but i can't remember if we had it on
10:12 - if i did it on the stream and we have a
10:14 - custom post type for human resources
10:16 - content and also for campus security
10:19 - content
10:21 - so i brought over i migrated all the
10:24 - content for departments all the content
10:27 - for majors
10:28 - and
10:29 - some content for human resources i don't
10:31 - think i found it all in the database
10:36 - and
10:37 - i just saw we have a request to share
10:38 - this pomodoro timer i'm going to start
10:40 - this up now
10:43 - so i break up everything in a 25 minute
10:45 - chunks and then
10:49 - we take a break for five minutes do some
10:51 - question and answer and then go back and
10:53 - do another 25 minutes
10:55 - and
10:57 - let's see
11:04 - all right so
11:07 - this is the site
11:10 - if you remember i've
11:12 - decided
11:14 - that i think we ought to focus on the
11:16 - mobile view first so we're going to be
11:18 - in this mobile view most of the time
11:21 - and then we'll expand and double check
11:23 - and make sure things look alright
11:26 - when we have a a wider screen
11:33 - and let's go to the code now
11:37 - so
11:38 - what we need to do is get pull in some
11:41 - of that new data that i migrated from
11:44 - our sql server database over to the
11:46 - mysql database
11:48 - and we're going to pull that out with
11:49 - graphql
11:51 - and we need to bring it over so the
11:53 - first thing we need then
11:54 - is
11:56 - what we need a component to bring the
11:58 - data into but we also need
12:01 - a query
12:03 - a graphql query
12:06 - so let's do that now i
12:08 - we have
12:10 - so we just did this one
12:12 - the last time we were messing around
12:13 - with graphql we made this component and
12:15 - we made a query for it so this is going
12:17 - to be an ideal component for us to copy
12:20 - we didn't do a lot of custom things with
12:22 - it so this will be kind of our our
12:25 - template we're going to copy this
12:28 - and then
12:31 - we'll paste
12:33 - we'll make another
12:35 - page so this is the the pages folder
12:39 - in in next normally anything in this
12:42 - folder automatically becomes a route so
12:45 - if i went to like slash faculty.js
12:49 - it would take me to a page
12:52 - it take me to this this faculty page
12:54 - right it would treat the
12:56 - the component as like the root page
12:59 - there
13:02 - but you'll see in a minute we're going
13:03 - to do some custom routing and we'll have
13:05 - to work on that too to get everything to
13:06 - work right
13:08 - so we do have
13:10 - a little bit different
13:11 - stuff going on here
13:15 - so first things first let's make this
13:16 - component
13:19 - i'm using visual studio code here in
13:21 - case
13:22 - anyone is wondering
13:25 - and
13:26 - let's see
13:28 - i have the seti theme running
13:31 - why can't i find this
13:34 - because it's not there
13:37 - i'm just trying to make a new file
13:40 - there we are
13:43 - uh
13:46 - department.js
13:50 - there we are and now let's change the
13:53 - name here
13:56 - yes we'll
13:57 - let's actually grab this right up here
14:02 - and
14:10 - all right and i don't want this
14:11 - capitalization here so i'm going to get
14:13 - rid of that right now and i'm going to
14:15 - get rid of it here
14:19 - all right so we have this
14:21 - ready and what it'll give us
14:24 - is the content
14:27 - so let me explain i guess i'll explain
14:29 - this briefly since we have it up here
14:31 - we
14:32 - there's a lot of other stuff that kind
14:34 - of went into this so
14:36 - i'm not going to go over every piece of
14:38 - it
14:39 - if you want to know more about that you
14:41 - can look at the code it's available on
14:43 - our github repo
14:45 - the links in the description
14:48 - you can watch previous
14:50 - uh episodes previous streams
14:53 - if you want to figure out kind of more
14:54 - of how we set this up we didn't set up
14:57 - everything on the stream but i do
14:58 - believe we went over everything on the
15:00 - stream
15:02 - so basically
15:03 - when a user goes to a certain route
15:06 - which we will set up so it'll be like
15:08 - departments slash
15:10 - english right for let's say we go to the
15:12 - english department page so you type in
15:14 - franciscan.edu departments slash english
15:20 - and
15:23 - what will happen first
15:25 - is the router
15:26 - will pass
15:28 - the id which in this case would be the
15:30 - slug
15:31 - english
15:33 - will pass it to our component
15:35 - right so
15:36 - we have id passed in
15:39 - the id is then going to get passed to
15:41 - our query which we're going to write in
15:43 - a minute that query based on the id is
15:46 - going to ask for that specific
15:47 - information we need to render this page
15:50 - from
15:51 - our wp graphql plugin that we have
15:54 - running with wordpress and our mysql
15:56 - database we're going to get the data
15:57 - back it's going to get rendered
16:00 - potentially server side could possibly
16:03 - also render client side that's what
16:05 - kind of this get initial props function
16:07 - allows that to happen
16:09 - then
16:10 - our data is going to be available
16:13 - uh to us through props
16:16 - right so we've already we have this prop
16:19 - set here for data so we don't need to
16:20 - use it down here but basically we go
16:23 - this props data departments
16:25 - edges and edges as it erase we need to
16:27 - get the first
16:29 - element in the array node and then
16:31 - content
16:32 - that gives us our content
16:34 - that lives in the mysql database right
16:37 - so we pulled all that in and then it
16:39 - will render that specific content for
16:41 - the english department because that's
16:43 - the route we went to
16:45 - so that's how it's all going to happen
16:48 - we have one part of this done we need
16:51 - two other parts for this to really work
16:54 - so let's set up our query and then let's
16:57 - set up our route
16:59 - and it should work
17:04 - so we can take go to our queries where i
17:07 - have these at
17:11 - let me
17:13 - shrink some of these folders here so we
17:15 - can see what we're dealing with
17:17 - components
17:20 - lib queries good all right so we're
17:23 - going to make
17:25 - a new file and we're going to call this
17:32 - we'll also call this department.js
17:36 - and let's take what we had in major and
17:38 - let's copy it
17:40 - and go back to department and paste it
17:43 - alright so this is what a graphql query
17:45 - looks like
17:47 - you can do a lot of other things with
17:48 - graphql queries but this is what we need
17:50 - to do for this one
17:52 - so let's change the name here
18:01 - so we need department
18:03 - so we have this department query we're
18:05 - exporting this as a constant right and
18:07 - then we import into our component as we
18:09 - saw earlier and that's why we can use it
18:11 - in a component
18:12 - but it's going to grab
18:14 - that that string so we're passing in
18:18 - what we have here is as name
18:20 - we're passing in that id that that slug
18:23 - if you want to use the
18:25 - the term that wordpress uses for their
18:27 - posts
18:30 - we're passing that in so it's going to
18:32 - look in departments
18:34 - where the name
18:36 - is equal to in our example case we're
18:38 - going to say english so where the name
18:40 - is english so
18:43 - what we'll have
18:45 - in our database is there's only going to
18:48 - be one depart piece of data that has
18:51 - department or has the slug of english
18:53 - okay so
18:55 - we're going to make sure it's always
18:56 - just one
18:57 - and then within that
18:59 - we got to go down some some levels
19:01 - that's just the way the data is set up
19:04 - but then we want to get the id
19:07 - of that post we want to get the title
19:09 - the slug and the content
19:12 - there are other things we could get as
19:13 - well but we don't we don't need it we
19:15 - don't need to display that on on this
19:17 - page
19:18 - so if you want to go to the repo you can
19:20 - check out our other queries sometimes
19:22 - we're getting other things if you just
19:24 - want to see some some different examples
19:26 - they're there but for now this is all we
19:28 - need and you see we actually aren't even
19:31 - using these yet
19:33 - but i was pulling them in because i
19:35 - anticipated potentially needing them at
19:37 - some point if we get closer to the site
19:40 - launch or even after we launch and we
19:42 - find that we don't need this we can
19:44 - always get rid of these
19:45 - and
19:48 - then we'll just
19:49 - save a little bit of data coming in
19:52 - so let me save that
19:54 - so we have two of our three parts done
19:57 - now we have our component we have our
20:00 - query now let's go to our server
20:03 - and let's put this route in so we have
20:06 - our server.js file
20:09 - and
20:12 - you can see how we did this with major
20:15 - right so we're doing server.get
20:20 - major and then we have this id here
20:23 - right and that's kind of the variable
20:25 - part
20:27 - and then
20:29 - we're making sure that the component
20:31 - that gets rendered
20:35 - is major right so
20:37 - it matches up in this case sometimes we
20:39 - have difference
20:42 - i think so in this case our url is going
20:45 - to be contact but we're actually sending
20:47 - it to the directory component
20:50 - so
20:51 - you can name your components in your
20:53 - route something entirely different and
20:54 - still direct it to the right place
20:59 - generally though i'm trying to keep
21:00 - things
21:01 - the same
21:03 - so i had some other things here i think
21:05 - that were
21:06 - tests
21:13 - okay
21:13 - yeah so we're gonna need to let's grab
21:16 - this one
21:19 - and i need
21:21 - i need to split this up a bit
21:24 - make some comments
21:28 - majors
21:34 - unfortunately our router is going to get
21:36 - huge
21:38 - we need to try to keep the urls intact
21:40 - from the old the current site
21:43 - and the new site that we're building
21:46 - uh so that's that's kind of proving a
21:48 - little bit
21:49 - difficult
21:51 - that's why our router is gonna be a bit
21:52 - of a mess
21:54 - unless we can figure out some other
21:56 - solution to this
21:58 - but right now
21:59 - some of the content is just we're just
22:02 - gonna manually have to make these routes
22:05 - all right so let me go with department
22:12 - so we have department and then id
22:15 - is going to go to
22:20 - department
22:26 - i what i actually want too is
22:28 - i want another route so i'm just going
22:31 - to put it in here right now although
22:32 - we're not going to do anything with it
22:34 - yet
22:35 - i want if we have department
22:37 - with nothing at the end
22:39 - i want that to go to
22:41 - let's call it department
22:51 - department list
22:54 - so we're gonna have to make that
22:56 - component basically i want department to
22:58 - have a list of all the departments and
23:00 - then you can click on that so that's how
23:02 - we're gonna do that i'm i'm pretty sure
23:04 - that'll work i have done it before
23:06 - but i haven't looked at the code for it
23:08 - for a few months
23:12 - all right
23:13 - so now
23:15 - when a user goes to
23:18 - in our case localhost 3000 3002 or
23:22 - something maybe we're under 3 000.
23:24 - localhost 3000
23:26 - uh and then department
23:28 - and in our case we were going to say
23:30 - english
23:31 - it'll route that send that id to
23:33 - department grab the data that it needs
23:35 - and then render it
23:40 - all right
23:45 - make sure that saved
23:47 - whoops
23:51 - there we are
23:53 - all right so that's saved we have a
23:55 - query we have our component
23:57 - let's try it out there's actually one
23:59 - more thing i need to do
24:01 - i imported the data but unfortunately we
24:04 - need to manually go in and change the
24:06 - slugs to make this work
24:08 - there's really no way around that
24:12 - so i think i'm going to have one of my
24:14 - colleagues go in and do this or a
24:17 - a student worker
24:18 - do it
24:20 - because it's certainly something i could
24:23 - do
24:24 - but there's other things that only i can
24:25 - do so it's better if i use my time for
24:27 - that and this is something that really
24:29 - anyone could do if if you just tell them
24:32 - how to do it so right now on my other
24:35 - screen i guess i could bring this over
24:37 - i'll bring it over so y'all can see it
24:39 - won't be as boring
24:40 - so here's that the wordpress site where
24:43 - we have all our different post types
24:46 - we're only using wordpress for the
24:47 - content management alright so this is a
24:49 - normal wordpress site where we'd go in
24:51 - and have a theme and all that
24:53 - we just want the content management it's
24:55 - basically just a ui for users to be able
24:58 - to very easily put data into a mysql
25:00 - database
25:02 - that's all we're using it for
25:05 - um
25:07 - majors let's find english
25:10 - oh no we're doing departments aren't we
25:12 - yeah departments
25:18 - so we're going to search see uh the
25:20 - admin section here with wordpress is
25:22 - actually pretty nice so
25:24 - you know why why reinvent
25:26 - an admin uh thing if we could just use
25:29 - wordpress it's not exactly the way that
25:31 - it's intended to use wordpress but it
25:33 - works
25:35 - english department text yeah this is it
25:40 - this is what we want
25:42 - okay
25:43 - so we need to go into slug so by default
25:46 - you don't see slug on wordpress i need
25:48 - to enable that
25:50 - so now that i've enabled it i can see
25:52 - the slug
25:56 - so i'm going to change that to just
25:57 - english
26:01 - so now
26:03 - that the slug is just english it should
26:05 - work
26:07 - so let's go back
26:10 - to our site
26:12 - and i'm going to do departments
26:15 - i'm sorry department
26:18 - singular
26:20 - english
26:22 - no
26:22 - oh you know what i might need to restart
26:25 - the server
26:26 - let me try that first i think
26:29 - yeah i think that was uh an issue
26:33 - last time i was working on this
26:43 - all right let's see
26:44 - hey look now
26:46 - hey we got a different error that's
26:48 - progress
26:50 - uh let's see to lowercase element type
26:53 - to lowercase it's not a function
27:00 - hmm
27:06 - all right
27:07 - let's check out our code to see what's
27:09 - going on
27:12 - all right our server
27:15 - department department list
27:19 - i'm going to take this out i don't think
27:20 - this is the problem but just in case
27:22 - let's take it out because this was kind
27:24 - of the only new thing we had in the
27:25 - server that i wasn't sure about
27:28 - so let's take that out first
27:30 - and restart
27:32 - just to be sure if this works it'll be
27:34 - an easy fix so it's worth trying out
27:36 - first
27:40 - so let's let that restart should only
27:42 - take a second
27:45 - all right we're still getting the same
27:47 - error
27:53 - yep okay and that's fine
27:57 - let me see i should look at the live
27:59 - chat to see if anybody noticed
28:07 - all right
28:09 - let's see if anybody noticed the mistake
28:11 - that i had made so what do we need
28:13 - department pages let's make sure
28:17 - that i got
28:20 - i'm guessing that maybe i didn't copy
28:23 - i didn't change every instance of major
28:26 - to department department query
28:28 - department
28:30 - um
28:43 - i wonder
28:44 - maybe
28:48 - apartments
28:56 - and
28:56 - all right harsh is saying test the query
29:13 - i wonder if i need to refresh
29:17 - where's my wordpress install
29:20 - here it is
29:34 - cities
29:53 - all right
30:00 - okay i didn't know
30:02 - there was some issue with uh wordpress
30:04 - that i i needed to
30:08 - i don't even remember what it was called
30:10 - i needed to mess like uh flush the
30:12 - permalinks i think or something like
30:14 - that so i just wanted to double check
30:16 - that
30:17 - uh the error showing two error in the
30:19 - component okay harshit says
30:22 - visual studio code is showing aaron
30:25 - errors in the component
30:31 - okay
30:34 - and then
30:36 - render
30:38 - missing space before function
30:39 - parentheses
30:42 - all right
30:44 - uh all right
30:47 - the error
30:49 - is it not saved is that the problem
30:54 - oh i just uh
30:56 - nikki is saying i didn't save it all
30:58 - right let's let's see if that was the
30:59 - problem
31:04 - all right
31:05 - i feel a little silly but i'm really
31:06 - glad that was no that wasn't the problem
31:09 - well it kind of was it kind of was we
31:11 - have a different error now so it's
31:12 - saying edges is undefined
31:15 - okay
31:16 - so that probably means we're not getting
31:18 - the data back that we should be getting
31:21 - uh so go down here saying edges is
31:24 - undefined
31:25 - so
31:26 - i wonder
31:28 - i'm gonna change from uh
31:31 - plural to singular see if that makes a
31:33 - difference
31:37 - all right
31:40 - so i don't think that was the case
31:43 - in my query
31:47 - let me change from plural to singular
31:50 - here
31:51 - see if it makes a difference
31:57 - hmm no
31:59 - i know that that fixed something the
32:01 - last time
32:03 - um
32:07 - all right so we have
32:10 - department pages save server
32:19 - server
32:32 - okay
32:41 - i don't think i want this route
32:45 - i don't know if this is what's messing
32:47 - us up but i definitely don't want this
32:48 - in here so i'm going to comment it out
32:50 - for now just in case i i realized later
32:52 - that i wanted it in there
32:57 - um let's see
33:07 - so while that refreshes i'm just going
33:08 - to show you this was taking
33:11 - basically anything
33:13 - that that was put in here after a slash
33:17 - and treating it like an id and then
33:19 - sending it to
33:21 - the component major
33:25 - and
33:26 - i did not want that to happen
33:29 - and that potentially could have been
33:31 - messing things up
33:36 - all right let's just
33:40 - no still still a problem okay
33:43 - department
33:44 - english
33:53 - so i am saying department
33:56 - right
33:59 - yeah departments and departments
34:02 - all right so i'm sending that to the
34:04 - right place
34:16 - all right
34:17 - okay let's let's then test uh so a
34:21 - little earlier harshit had the good idea
34:23 - to test the query
34:25 - so let's do that
34:37 - so where
34:38 - i can never remember how to get back to
34:42 - there it is
34:45 - i had my cursor right on there
34:48 - i just could never remember what the
34:50 - icon was okay
34:54 - all right so we are yeah we're at the
34:56 - right end point
34:58 - and
35:00 - let's run that
35:02 - oh okay
35:04 - not working
35:09 - no schema
35:18 - that's that's odd we don't have
35:20 - anything
35:25 - i wonder if any of our routes are
35:26 - working
35:30 - go to something that
35:33 - um
35:35 - yeah let's go to a faculty members page
35:40 - oh okay so something's wrong with
35:42 - everything so it's not just that
35:46 - that query so what is going on
36:00 - let's check our plugins
36:03 - wp graphql
36:18 - and check the version 0.0.22
36:50 - it looks like there's no breaking
36:52 - changes so
36:54 - at least nothing labeled as a breaking
36:56 - change so you might want to just update
36:59 - see if that makes a difference
37:00 - my
37:10 - all right harshit is put in
37:13 - scc that's wp make sure to see the night
37:20 - i should just put in a different url
37:22 - here
37:24 - yeah that url should work hard but
37:27 - this one
37:28 - this one's been working for me as well
37:30 - i'll try out the other one though let's
37:32 - do that quickly before we go uh do some
37:36 - questions
37:40 - actually where are we
37:52 - actually that's what we have been using
37:55 - let's try to switch that out for
37:59 - for this and see if it makes a
38:00 - difference
38:19 - no no difference
38:24 - it's just
38:33 - let's see
38:35 - all right well let me
38:36 - go to
38:40 - rook says faculty.js is also unsaved oh
38:44 - it shouldn't i haven't done any work on
38:46 - faculty.js for a long time so
38:49 - it should be fun and we we had it um
38:54 - we had it working
39:09 - oh yeah let me answer let me take a
39:11 - break answer some questions
39:13 - maybe
39:14 - this will
39:17 - help clear my mind a bit
39:20 - as well
39:21 - all right so
39:24 - we're going to take five minutes
39:27 - and
39:31 - i'm going to scroll all the way up to
39:33 - the top of the live chat
39:38 - let's see
39:53 - milo says i've been following your
39:55 - previous live stream great videos thank
39:57 - you i really appreciate you saying that
39:59 - thanks for watching
40:08 - lucas says hi jesse i'm from brazil and
40:11 - i'm a software developer i like so much
40:13 - your live streams awesome
40:16 - thank you for saying that
40:25 - uh uh adrian that's what the timer was
40:27 - for
40:29 - i think i did explain at the beginning
40:32 - um
40:33 - i'll just explain it quickly again i it
40:35 - likes it breaks up my work so i use it
40:37 - throughout the day to break up my work
40:38 - into small chunks it just makes things
40:41 - more manageable you make sure you you
40:43 - get a break and
40:44 - the breaks are nice because
40:46 - you stop and think you know sometimes
40:48 - you get into doing something and it's
40:51 - you keep working at it working at it if
40:53 - you take time to stop and think you
40:54 - might find like oh well i'm even doing
40:57 - this i could have done it this way and
40:59 - it would be so much better or you know
41:01 - maybe we just go with something
41:03 - completely different so
41:05 - um it lets you stop and just think about
41:08 - what the best use of your time can be
41:13 - but anyway on the show i i on the stream
41:16 - we break it up so i do 25 minutes of
41:18 - coding in five minutes in the live chat
41:21 - 25 minutes of coding like back and forth
41:23 - and that way i don't ignore the live
41:25 - chat for too long but then also i don't
41:27 - get caught up in just talking the whole
41:28 - time and not
41:30 - uh getting anything done with the code
41:41 - globber as what's the graphql client you
41:43 - use
41:44 - so we're using apollo with our react app
41:47 - and then
41:49 - on the uh wordpress installation we're
41:51 - using a plug-in called wp graphql that
41:54 - just gets
41:55 - all that data out of wordpress for us
41:57 - without you know we don't really have to
41:59 - set up very much of anything
42:03 - christian says this is open source cool
42:05 - yep everything i do here is is open
42:08 - source
42:09 - almost everything there was like one
42:11 - project we did a little bit of work on
42:12 - that was a private repo
42:21 - nabig says hi everyone hey how's it
42:23 - going
42:27 - uh michael asked if in the link that i
42:29 - posted are those m's or r's followed by
42:32 - ends not sure i want to click on that
42:35 - i don't even know what what would it be
42:39 - oh
42:41 - i see what you mean now michael yeah
42:43 - don't want to click on that if it was
42:46 - if it was the latter case
42:48 - inna hello how's it going i haven't seen
42:51 - you in the stream for a while i'm glad
42:53 - uh glad you could join us today
43:03 - hopefully i'm pronouncing that right
43:05 - says jesse could you say how much of a
43:07 - challenge it would be to make an api in
43:10 - node that a front-end react application
43:12 - could use
43:14 - to read and write a database
43:22 - i mean i guess it
43:24 - it somewhat depends on the details right
43:27 - uh but making an api like that is not
43:30 - it's not really that big of a deal
43:32 - so i mean it depends like if you've done
43:34 - it before if you're good with nodes
43:35 - there's a lot of different factors that
43:37 - could make it take longer but uh like a
43:40 - very simple node api is is not really
43:44 - uh that difficult
43:46 - hardship uh would be a better one to
43:48 - know exactly because he handles
43:50 - a lot of back end stuff he's
43:52 - uh i'll harsh it would you say you're
43:55 - mostly a back end developer i mean
43:57 - you're pretty you're pretty full stacked
43:59 - though so
44:00 - um but anyway har should set up a lot
44:02 - more stuff like that than i have so
44:06 - um maybe he could you know give a better
44:09 - answer
44:13 - uh bastawa says i'm using wordpress also
44:16 - as a content management data source
44:18 - awesome
44:19 - awesome yeah it's it's way more common
44:22 - now i remember like a couple years ago
44:23 - people were talking about it but it was
44:26 - like who's who's really using this in
44:29 - production
44:30 - and i was very curious about it because
44:32 - i had been doing wordpress sites before
44:35 - like the normal way
44:37 - and
44:39 - so i kind of messed around with it a
44:40 - little bit and i did end up doing
44:43 - sites for clients with it
44:46 - when it was still like kind of new
44:48 - but now i i think it's more like people
44:51 - are aware of it you know larger sites
44:53 - are using it in production so it's kind
44:55 - of like mainstream now i guess
44:58 - uh but it's still a weird concept for
45:00 - some people like i'm pretty sure some of
45:02 - my bosses like think
45:05 - that i'm making a just a regular
45:07 - wordpress site
45:08 - um
45:10 - it's just hard
45:12 - i guess it's hard to explain
45:14 - um this
45:15 - unless you're doing it like you're in
45:17 - the
45:18 - the
45:19 - process of creating it you know maybe a
45:22 - little bit difficult to understand why
45:24 - it's like
45:25 - we're using wordpress but it's not a
45:27 - wordpress site
45:28 - right
45:31 - all right
45:32 - my five minute timer is up so i'm gonna
45:35 - write down where i left off here in the
45:36 - live chat
45:42 - and let's figure out what the problem is
45:45 - here i think we're really close to
45:47 - getting this to work
45:55 - all right so we're not getting any data
45:59 - from wordpress
46:00 - so let's try this
46:02 - so we've already tested out both these
46:04 - urls
46:06 - but i do want to
46:11 - grab this url again
46:16 - and let's go over here
46:18 - where we're testing this out let me make
46:20 - this a lot bigger for you all
46:23 - and we can actually expand that there we
46:26 - are
46:27 - all right so i'm gonna put in this
46:31 - and see what happens when we set that
46:33 - end point all right yeah we have server
46:35 - errors
46:36 - for both
46:44 - and double check set endpoint servers
46:52 - all right
47:02 - um
47:03 - so let's let's upgrade then
47:06 - let's upgrade our
47:10 - plug-in
47:11 - and see if it if it helps i'd like to
47:13 - upgrade the plug-in anyway so
47:16 - now's a good time to do it if it fixes
47:18 - our problem great if it doesn't then
47:20 - at least we've updated our plug-in
47:28 - okay
47:43 - oh harsh it says try reverting the
47:45 - changes in the plug-in
47:52 - which which plug-in are we talking about
47:54 - the the custom
47:56 - post types one
48:49 - i'm just scanning this plug in quickly
48:51 - just to see if something stands out as a
48:53 - mistake
49:01 - all right everything looks okay
49:04 - just from a quick scan it looks okay
49:06 - in terms of the stuff that i've changed
49:10 - uh that's weird was it
49:14 - okay
49:19 - now i guess we can check
49:24 - where did i bring that up over here huh
49:35 - all right let's see
50:05 - all right i'm going to go to wordpress
50:07 - and let's upload this plugin
50:15 - let's go to the plugins
50:17 - let's
50:19 - let's get rid of this version
50:26 - let's install the new one
50:33 - all right so now we have to do is just
50:34 - upload this zip file
50:38 - um
50:45 - and we'll activate the plugin
50:48 - wonderful
50:49 - i am going to go back in here to the
50:51 - permalinks and
50:57 - this uh at least it did say in the
50:59 - documentation for this plug-in maybe
51:01 - it's different now but at one time it
51:02 - said you had to flush the permalinks for
51:04 - everything to work i don't know of any
51:06 - other way to flush the permalinks other
51:08 - than to do this i'm sure there's
51:09 - probably some some other way but this
51:12 - works for me and it only takes a few
51:13 - seconds
51:16 - all right
51:19 - let's see what we have now i guess i
51:22 - could just check right here
51:24 - or right here
51:43 - um
51:50 - hmm
51:58 - all right let me check out
52:01 - some of this
52:03 - i usually pass
52:05 - input terms as part of object
52:07 - velocitation
52:40 - okay
52:42 - check the console
52:46 - i should say check the console
52:51 - um
52:53 - oh you mean the uh
52:58 - devtools console
53:05 - all right let's get rid of this and
53:07 - refresh
53:12 - okay that's a lot of stuff
53:19 - 500 internal server error
53:34 - so
54:02 - harsh it's saying check the console in
54:07 - graphic ul
54:09 - har i was just
54:10 - i was just saying if the schema would
54:12 - come up
54:14 - i mean i could put a query in i guess
54:49 - yeah it's still the same
55:13 - hmm
55:20 - i mean i'm
55:22 - well i'd say we've narrowed it down the
55:24 - problem is something with wordpress
55:35 - i'm going to check the issues
56:20 - all right this doesn't look like the
56:21 - error that we're getting
56:26 - let's see
56:41 - all right nikki's hanging a type error
56:50 - all right let's check out wordpress
57:08 - let me
57:18 - i'm going to comment out

57:24 - did today
57:27 - just in case i've messed something up
57:29 - here
57:38 - actually do i really want to do this
57:41 - am i going to lose my data

58:55 - oh
59:17 - okay
59:34 - all right
59:38 - harsh it says revert plug-in
59:41 - uh harshit which plug-in the custom one

62:26 - still working
62:31 - oh actually
62:35 - okay
62:37 - now let's
62:40 - undo

65:09 - plug-in does not like
65:15 - the
65:17 - the hyphens
65:38 - yes all right cool
65:40 - that's the problem we can't put hyphens
65:45 - i ca i slightly remember uh do you
65:47 - remember when um the guy who built the
65:50 - wp graphql plug-in was in here
65:53 - i remember
65:54 - talking about some issue with these
65:56 - hyphens
65:58 - man why can't i remember his name now
66:03 - i gotta
66:04 - i i gotta give him credit for this
66:06 - plug-in so
66:08 - you gotta figure out his name
66:10 - he was just here on this issue
66:14 - anybody remember
66:18 - jason that's it jason was in here in the
66:21 - live chat a while back jason ball yeah

66:25 - um all right cool so
66:29 - all i have to do now is uncomment this
66:37 - and
66:38 - hope that i did not
66:41 - like really lose my data here
66:44 - i don't think i did but
66:47 - if i did that's a lot of
66:49 - migration
66:52 - that i have to do ever again
66:56 - all right cool
67:02 - it's there
67:05 - yeah all right everything's still there

67:56 - awesome all right this definitely needs
67:58 - a title let's let's add that title in
68:02 - in our react component
68:05 - let's think we save some time yeah
68:07 - almost three minutes let's do this
68:18 - let's go in here with uh
68:21 - h2
68:25 - and
68:29 - let's get this
68:46 - and i don't need double
68:49 - curlies
68:57 - all right let's see if i did that right
69:03 - i typed content in
69:05 - let's go
69:09 - title
69:13 - ah no i don't want english department
69:16 - text
69:17 - no
69:19 - you gotta be kidding me
69:35 - oh cool
69:38 - my co-worker got me a burrito for lunch
69:40 - and i was streaming instead of eating it
69:43 - so thank you
69:44 - i appreciate it
69:48 - all right let's see
69:52 - what am i looking for
69:54 - oh the wordpress thing i want to see
69:59 - depart where i'm at departments
70:04 - english department
70:06 - texts
70:21 - i want
70:23 - to bring in
70:24 - all right this is where it's actually
70:26 - going to be really useful that i brought
70:27 - in the slug
70:30 - oops
70:31 - because now i'm gonna do
70:34 - slug
70:49 - this should give us
70:52 - a all right english and then
70:55 - all we need to do is uh change the
70:58 - padding on that and make it
71:00 - uh uppercase and we can add department
71:03 - in at the end right so
71:07 - we can go like
71:09 - english can i do this
71:13 - i'm not sure if i can do that let's see
71:15 - oh cool i can
71:18 - um
71:19 - yeah so we'll just clean that up a bit
71:21 - and then basically
71:24 - that's it that's all we need now this
71:25 - isn't really a lot of content there's
71:27 - some other stuff pieces of data that i
71:29 - could pull in
71:30 - so
71:31 - i don't know if you noticed
71:33 - um
71:35 - here like we have a program list uh the
71:38 - header is really specific to the
71:40 - the um old content management system so
71:43 - we'll probably get rid of that
71:44 - uh i'm gonna have somebody else i think
71:46 - come in here and clean all this up and
71:48 - just leave what we need
71:49 - uh we have some this slider we're not
71:51 - gonna need because it won't work
71:55 - uh with the new system
71:59 - i'm not sure if the links will work so
72:01 - potentially we could add in
72:04 - a few other things on that page but
72:09 - for right now at least we have a url
72:11 - that matches up with
72:13 - the url on the current site
72:15 - and
72:18 - we have some content some relevant
72:20 - content there
72:22 - that's all we need for launch we can
72:24 - always add things later on
72:27 - uh i'd rather have things be super fast
72:29 - and really clean clean looking
72:33 - maybe risking being like bare or too
72:36 - plain
72:37 - then try to add in a bunch of stuff not
72:39 - make our launch date and
72:41 - have things loading slow
72:47 - all right so my timer went off again
72:51 - let me go back to the live chat i'm
72:53 - going to pick up right where i left off
72:55 - i'm going to go through i'm going to
72:56 - answer all your questions i'll read out
72:58 - some comments too if you have any
72:59 - questions now please put them in the
73:01 - live chat
73:02 - if you're watching this recording later
73:04 - and you have a question please put it in
73:05 - the comments or you can
73:07 - uh talk to me on twitter or
73:10 - instagram or whatever uh facebook
73:14 - however you want to find me
73:16 - i'm pretty easy to find on the internet
73:22 - all right let's see
73:24 - 12 39
73:27 - now i'm getting hungry now that i know
73:29 - there's a burrito waiting for me
73:36 - all right cool also i talked yesterday a
73:39 - little bit about mental health
73:41 - and i just wanted to give you another
73:44 - little update so
73:46 - i don't know some of you might be bored
73:47 - when i talk about stuff like this but i
73:49 - know some of you told me that you you
73:51 - struggle with mental health issues like
73:52 - depression anxiety as well so i thought
73:54 - i'd just bring this up
73:56 - um
73:57 - so this morning i was up super early
73:59 - like 4 00 am and i got up i worked out
74:04 - um
74:05 - i i work out on like an exercise bike so
74:08 - i played some zelda on the nintendo
74:10 - switch
74:11 - and um
74:14 - checked my my twitter
74:16 - you know my instagram and all that
74:18 - uh i even did some weights i have a
74:20 - little weight bench in the basement so i
74:22 - haven't done like free weights and
74:26 - probably since summer like early summer
74:29 - because i hurt my wrist i was kind of
74:31 - afraid to mess it up but if i keep it
74:34 - really straight you know put the weight
74:36 - in the right spot it doesn't hurt my my
74:39 - wrist so
74:40 - that's good to know
74:42 - anyway i did all that i felt really good
74:45 - um when i went to sleep last night it
74:48 - was like i could stay up
74:50 - and
74:51 - you know do what watch netflix or
74:52 - something uh or i could go to bed early
74:56 - and i was excited to wake up in the
74:58 - morning
74:59 - early
75:00 - like that never happens for me usually
75:02 - i'm feeling down i get to the end of the
75:04 - night it's like i can't sleep i want to
75:06 - stay up because for some reason i feel
75:08 - like worthless like i didn't get
75:10 - anything done that day
75:11 - and so it's somehow like extending the
75:13 - day will make it better but it never
75:15 - does it just makes me like
75:17 - look at the clock and say like oh
75:18 - tomorrow's going to be terrible because
75:19 - i'm gonna have to wake up and i won't
75:21 - get enough sleep it's like this cycle
75:23 - right but now
75:25 - with the help of some melatonin i can go
75:27 - to sleep early and then my body
75:29 - naturally wakes me up my alarm was set
75:31 - for six i woke up at four
75:34 - uh and i felt great i got like
75:36 - seven
75:38 - hours like seven and a half hours of
75:40 - sleep i was in bed early so
75:43 - i had my feet up on something and they
75:45 - just fell off so that was why i just
75:46 - jerked so
75:48 - um
75:50 - so anyway i just kind of wanted to share
75:51 - that i'm sure that's not a solution for
75:53 - everybody we're all different but
75:57 - it's working for me so far this has been
75:59 - almost two weeks that i've been doing
76:01 - this and
76:02 - like my body finally got in a routine
76:04 - where it's starting to happen like
76:05 - naturally
76:07 - and i feel good
76:09 - um
76:10 - i started to feel tired a lot earlier in
76:12 - the day but you know that's okay when i
76:14 - need to be awake for work and then you
76:16 - know i come home play with my kids for a
76:18 - little bit
76:19 - i have enough energy
76:21 - so
76:23 - anyway just wanted to share that all
76:24 - right i'm going to go back to the live
76:25 - chat now
76:30 - um and as always let me know your
76:32 - opinion on stuff if you want me to share
76:34 - more or less or the same amount of this
76:36 - kind of stuff
76:38 - please let me know i'll try to wait till
76:39 - the end to share it then that way if you
76:41 - just are here for the code you can take
76:42 - off
76:44 - but
76:46 - anyway i i always want to make the
76:47 - streams better uh so i do appreciate
76:50 - feedback
76:52 - uh christian says why don't you use
76:54 - keystone js we actually thought about
76:56 - using keystone we read up on that uh
76:59 - it's just
77:00 - keystone i believe keystone was the one
77:02 - that looked really promising but it
77:04 - hadn't been updated for a long time it
77:06 - just seemed like it wasn't really that
77:08 - actively maintained
77:10 - so i was nervous about using something
77:14 - that might not be maintained
77:17 - um
77:18 - that's why we ended up not going with
77:19 - keystone and we looked at some other
77:21 - things like keystone
77:23 - uh but everything was like in betas
77:25 - though i just i didn't want to use it
77:28 - for this site
77:42 - jake asks if this is a project for a
77:44 - client well it's for my employers so i
77:46 - do have some clients on the side that i
77:48 - do work for
77:50 - um but
77:51 - this particular site is for my employer
77:53 - which is franciscan university
77:56 - so i'm employed here in the marketing
77:58 - department as a front-end developer
78:01 - and this is their going to be their main
78:02 - website
78:04 - so it's a big deal it's the biggest
78:06 - project that i've worked on for them a
78:08 - lot of people are
78:10 - i wouldn't say a lot of people but the
78:11 - people that know what i'm doing
78:13 - are
78:15 - like kind of excited which is kind of
78:17 - which is cool they they've seen my other
78:18 - work and so they're
78:20 - i think they have high expectations for
78:22 - this so i don't want to let anybody down
78:24 - mainly their expectations are it's going
78:26 - to be clean
78:27 - and it's going to be really fast
78:30 - and it's going to be easy to navigate
78:32 - from from the people i've talked to
78:34 - that's like the things that they're
78:35 - expecting from this
78:38 - so that's what i want to deliver
78:47 - jake also asks uh
78:50 - did they request reacts
78:52 - seems a bit overkill for a university
78:54 - website
78:55 - unless i'm missing something which i
78:57 - probably am
78:58 - that's a really good question i think we
79:00 - addressed some of this earlier
79:02 - uh maybe not with this project but with
79:04 - some previous projects that i thought
79:06 - i tended to agree
79:08 - possibly did not need react
79:11 - but
79:12 - here's my feeling on that
79:15 - number one
79:16 - all the projects that i do here tend to
79:18 - grow
79:19 - there's like so much scope creep and
79:21 - since this isn't my client that i can
79:23 - just walk away from
79:24 - when our contract is over
79:26 - uh
79:27 - i'm still here i'm always here i'm gonna
79:29 - have to maintain what i build
79:31 - so
79:32 - projects like this i've done before here
79:35 - in like just plain javascript jquery and
79:38 - stuff and then as the additions pile up
79:41 - it gets to be a mess we saw
79:43 - two days ago i showed everyone the
79:45 - example of my
79:47 - my spaghetti code jquery single page app
79:50 - that is just
79:52 - it's hard to maintain
79:55 - so
79:55 - going with something
79:57 - like react
79:58 - which has these components
80:02 - in a structure makes it
80:05 - a lot easier to maintain in my opinion
80:08 - also by doing react we're kind of going
80:10 - react all across the board unless we're
80:12 - doing something really simple we're
80:14 - using react
80:15 - um my my colleague that works next to me
80:18 - is using uh wordpress with with themes
80:22 - uh as well so he has like a custom theme
80:24 - that works with our branding so if we
80:26 - need a like a single page site or
80:28 - something up really quickly
80:30 - he can just use that theme and he has it
80:32 - all on like a sub domain so he could
80:34 - just pop up another page
80:36 - in that wordpress installation so we do
80:39 - use that
80:41 - uh for some small things but ultimately
80:43 - by using react with everything we can
80:46 - have this wealth of components and code
80:49 - that can be easily copied and pasted in
80:51 - a project so
80:53 - you can kind of see the progression that
80:55 - we just kind of roll over the same code
80:57 - into the next project
80:58 - reuse a lot so it's like immediately we
81:02 - go into a project and we have so much
81:04 - done already
81:06 - so it's kind of nice to do it like that
81:08 - also
81:10 - i would like to get better with react i
81:12 - would like our students here in the
81:14 - computer science department to get
81:15 - better with react because it's it's in
81:17 - such high demand
81:19 - so i do have some interns well i have at
81:21 - least one intern work that's going to
81:23 - work with me this semester and then i
81:26 - have some other students that are going
81:28 - to do maybe some projects for a class so
81:30 - not officially an internship
81:33 - so anyway i thought
81:35 - hey i
81:36 - i can choose whatever i want to use for
81:38 - this
81:39 - why not choose something that's going to
81:41 - help out
81:43 - in a lot of different ways
81:45 - i also figure if we end up hiring like
81:48 - let's say my department grew
81:50 - most likely i would turn into maybe
81:52 - somewhat like of a project manager and i
81:54 - would have or maybe a lead developer or
81:56 - something and out of people working
81:58 - under me
81:59 - it's
82:00 - i think much more attractive
82:02 - if i go to job
82:04 - put out a job description to say hey
82:06 - like come work with react graphql just
82:09 - the latest like we want to stay on top
82:11 - of things
82:12 - versus
82:13 - hey let's work with this old extron cms
82:16 - and some jquery
82:19 - like that's
82:21 - that's great and then i'm gonna have to
82:22 - put like i need somebody that knows
82:24 - uh asp.net and sql server and my sql and
82:28 - php and c-sharp and
82:31 - right
82:32 - so i'm basically gonna say like i want a
82:35 - full stack developer that knows multiple
82:37 - languages but i'm going to pay you as
82:38 - much as
82:41 - um
82:42 - i don't know like
82:45 - i don't even know what the salary like
82:49 - and i don't even want to say an intern
82:50 - because
82:52 - anyway we're small universities so
82:54 - we can't compete on salary with with uh
82:57 - most companies that are hiring
82:59 - developers so
83:00 - i'm trying to look ahead to the future
83:02 - and say
83:04 - at one place we can compete is if we can
83:07 - guarantee developers that we are open to
83:10 - using the latest technology
83:12 - so that at least
83:13 - if you're not making the money you want
83:15 - now you come here build up your skills
83:18 - work on some projects then
83:20 - you'll be in a position to get hired and
83:22 - make more money if you want
83:24 - those are my thoughts
83:26 - hopefully it makes a little bit more
83:28 - sense as to why i went with react i do
83:30 - agree that for this site
83:32 - based on what we're doing now with the
83:33 - site
83:35 - not 100 necessary to use
83:38 - react we could have just used straight
83:40 - wordpress and it would have worked
83:43 - it would definitely not have been as
83:44 - fast as what we're doing
83:46 - uh or i think as
83:48 - as versatile wordpress can be really
83:50 - versatile but
83:51 - i i love being able to
83:53 - have complete control over things full
83:56 - stack javascript
83:58 - i mean albeit there's some php going on
84:01 - in the background
84:02 - you know with wordpress but basically
84:04 - our routing and everything we're doing
84:05 - javascript so
84:08 - um also
84:10 - the odds of this site staying like it is
84:13 - and not having additional things built
84:15 - into it
84:16 - that it would be nice to have react for
84:19 - are really small like this is
84:21 - nothing ever just stays as is somebody
84:24 - always has an idea it's like can we do
84:26 - this
84:27 - so it's nice that i can say like sure we
84:30 - can do that and i know
84:33 - i'll know exactly how to do it
84:35 - um
84:36 - with react would be easier than
84:38 - let's say with with wordpress
84:42 - i have experience with wordpress but i
84:44 - just hate to keep like add new plugins
84:46 - all the time my php is not good enough
84:49 - to custom code it and i don't really
84:51 - want to learn that much more php
84:53 - anyway that went off in a big tangent on
84:55 - that but i haven't really spoke about
84:57 - that for a long time like i'm thinking
84:59 - months so i figured it was a good
85:01 - good time to explain my reasoning behind
85:03 - that
85:11 - all right i see there were a lot of
85:12 - suggestions that you all gave on trying
85:14 - to find that error i really appreciate
85:16 - that
85:22 - world says maybe you broke the internet
85:47 - hey we got that wp graphql plugin
85:49 - upgraded too that was a nice little
85:51 - bonus i didn't i didn't plan on doing
85:53 - that today but
85:55 - it seemed like nothing broke it all
85:57 - worked
85:59 - alexi says hey everybody hey lexi thanks
86:01 - for joining us
86:15 - stephen said maybe you need some coffee
86:35 - i see uh nikki and michael or
86:38 - making some i.t jokes and stuff
86:40 - throughout here so it makes more sense
86:42 - now i glanced over and just saw these
86:44 - like random comments like what are they
86:45 - talking about
87:08 - our noticed how happy i was when i
87:10 - got the errors
87:12 - um
87:13 - yeah
87:15 - i was so hap because then we found it
87:18 - right like we were trying to find what
87:19 - piece of code made the error so
87:22 - anyway
87:25 - sometimes
87:27 - like getting a different error is also
87:29 - really exciting because you know you did
87:31 - something right like you made some
87:33 - progress it's like a different era
87:57 - har should ask if sitemaps help in seo
88:01 - uh yeah i would definitely do a site map
88:05 - seo is
88:06 - it's difficult to say exactly how much
88:08 - something helps in seo mainly because
88:12 - search engines usually don't tell you
88:13 - their formula if you knew their formula
88:16 - it would be really easy to
88:18 - like play the system right like people
88:21 - used to stuff
88:22 - their meta tags with stuff you know like
88:24 - their site would be about
88:26 - i don't know like skateboards right they
88:28 - sell skateboards but they would stuff
88:30 - their meta tags with like everything
88:32 - that was really interesting that that
88:35 - was the top search terms
88:37 - um so
88:40 - now like meta tags are basically
88:42 - worthless
88:44 - um so with the meta keywords tag is like
88:46 - worthless now
88:48 - uh so
88:49 - anyway
88:50 - that being said i think it's still good
88:53 - practice to have a site map
88:56 - i haven't really been into seo for a
88:58 - while i used to be
89:01 - really knowledgeable about seo like that
89:03 - was
89:04 - one of the things that i promised well i
89:06 - you can never promise right but one of
89:08 - the things that i would tell clients is
89:09 - that you know i'm going to try to get
89:11 - you on the front page of google search
89:13 - results and i was i was successful i
89:16 - could
89:17 - with their main search terms i could get
89:19 - every company that i ever tried with uh
89:22 - on the first page of google they were
89:24 - all local businesses though which is
89:26 - in my opinion it's not that hard to get
89:28 - a small local business up higher in
89:31 - their area like in a limited geographic
89:33 - area
89:34 - nationally or globally ranking somebody
89:37 - is that's the real trick
89:39 - but anyway site maps help
89:43 - as far as i know
89:50 - uh let's see oh christian says what was
89:53 - the bug okay christian the specific bug
89:56 - was uh i was using
90:01 - so in graphql
90:04 - i had this hyphenated so i had campus
90:07 - hyphen security
90:08 - and you can't use hyphens when i give a
90:11 - graphql name for these things
90:15 - you have to use
90:17 - uh camel case or all lowercase you know
90:20 - something like that
90:21 - that was the issue so that that was the
90:23 - bug
90:26 - among other things like the first bug we
90:28 - had was i forgot to save the file the
90:30 - next bug we had was
90:33 - i don't even remember i think we had
90:34 - some like intermediary bug between then
90:36 - but then finally the the ultimate
90:38 - problem was that
90:40 - uh that i wasn't supposed to have a
90:43 - hyphen there and now that i may have to
90:45 - go in and
90:46 - change some queries
90:49 - oh you know what i didn't even make
90:51 - queries for these yet so i don't have to
90:52 - change anything i just have to remember
90:54 - when i do these queries to camel cases
91:00 - world says burritos are good for mental
91:01 - health too
91:03 - i would agree with that
91:05 - i'm not a doctor so don't don't take
91:07 - that as medical advice
91:11 - wow martin said i slept 12 i slept 19
91:15 - hours two days ago it was bad
91:18 - 19 hours
91:20 - that's a lot of sleep
91:24 - i can't i couldn't get 19 hours i have
91:26 - too many kids for that
91:28 - somebody would wake me up for sure
91:31 - i'm lucky if i can get like just a
91:33 - regular night's sleep like seven hours
91:35 - without some kid waking up and needing
91:38 - something
91:44 - enjoy sleep while you can if you don't
91:46 - have kids
91:51 - i love them though i wouldn't trade it
91:53 - for sleep
92:01 - all right so nikki says the updates like
92:03 - the mental health updates are great uh
92:05 - interesting too topic that is often
92:07 - avoided
92:09 - all right cool
92:10 - i won't talk about it every day but
92:12 - i'll bring it up you know occasionally
92:16 - uh world says is franciscan university
92:18 - named after the current pope francis uh
92:20 - no it's named after um
92:23 - saint francis from
92:28 - 12th or 13th i think 13th century
92:32 - um so
92:34 - yeah so i think it was saint francis was
92:37 - you know he was around italy in that
92:39 - that general area in the 13th century so
92:43 - he did a lot of really cool stuff
92:45 - um
92:46 - if you check out check out his story
92:50 - it's pretty good
92:51 - really wealthy gave up everything
92:54 - he once went visited a a
92:57 - muslim sultan
92:59 - and talked to him about
93:02 - catholicism
93:03 - like
93:06 - really just kind of exciting cool stuff
93:08 - happened
93:09 - um yeah and so anyway he started a
93:12 - religious order that eventually became
93:14 - known as the franciscans it's really the
93:17 - fr order of friars minor is the official
93:20 - name he didn't name it after himself um
93:23 - but now we just call him the franciscans
93:25 - for short so that's why so the
93:26 - university is run by members of the
93:28 - order of friars minor who are like
93:32 - spiritual descendants of saint francis
93:35 - so
93:36 - this university has been around since
93:39 - the 40s or 50s i think 50s
93:42 - so
93:43 - definitely predates um the current pope
93:46 - but anyway good question thanks
93:52 - uh michael says definitely share more
93:53 - about your depression slash anxiety i'm
93:55 - going uh to a psych uh for one uh
93:59 - psychologist or psychiatrist and taking
94:01 - medicine for the other having tried
94:03 - melatonin because of the depression
94:04 - sleep isn't a problem for me
94:07 - um yeah yeah it's kind of weird right
94:10 - like so
94:11 - for me at least when i'm feeling
94:12 - depressed like i just want to sleep
94:15 - but then if i stay up to a certain point
94:18 - like i i won't sleep right it's like in
94:21 - the morning i don't want to get out of
94:22 - bed but at night i feel so depressed and
94:25 - feeling like i wasted a day i just don't
94:28 - want to sleep
94:30 - um it's weird it's it's kind of like a a
94:34 - weird point for me there so that's why
94:36 - the melatonin is easy like it doesn't
94:39 - i've taken the sleeping pills before
94:41 - that are like you know medical stuff
94:43 - that you can get addicted to and those
94:45 - work
94:47 - i feel groggy though like the sleep i
94:50 - get with those i don't really like as
94:51 - much
94:52 - there was one thing i had though that
94:53 - was prescription and that was amazing
94:56 - um but
94:58 - melatonin is nice it just helps you get
95:00 - to sleep i feel okay the next morning
95:02 - and uh it's non-habit forming so like i
95:05 - said again i'm not a doctor so don't
95:08 - don't listen to anything i'm saying you
95:10 - know as good medical advice
95:13 - but melatonin is pretty safe
95:16 - at least from what i've my experience
95:23 - uh let's see
95:25 - uh michael
95:26 - says scope creep um
95:29 - yeah scope creep like
95:32 - so like you have your initial like
95:35 - uh requirements for your project and
95:37 - then as your project goes on the client
95:39 - will add on extra things like oh can we
95:41 - make it do that can we make it do that
95:43 - and then you have scope creep so the
95:45 - project scope the requirements the
95:47 - project all of a sudden get bigger
95:50 - when i'm working here it's okay like i
95:52 - still get paid no matter what
95:54 - but for a client it can be problematic
95:56 - because you have your contract set out
95:58 - and if it's a flat rate
96:01 - for let's say like i'm gonna make your
96:02 - website i'm gonna charge you ten
96:03 - thousand dollars and it's gonna do this
96:06 - and then the clients are saying well i
96:07 - wanted to do this this and this at that
96:10 - point
96:11 - you need to say
96:12 - that's outside the scope of our initial
96:14 - agreement if you want to do that we're
96:16 - either going to have to amend our first
96:18 - contract or we're going to have to bring
96:20 - you know make a new contract
96:22 - and sometimes like i've had to say that
96:24 - before to clients and sometimes the
96:26 - client says okay well that's outside of
96:27 - our budget sometimes they say all right
96:30 - let's
96:30 - let's amend it other times i've had
96:32 - clients like compromising okay well
96:35 - this is how much more we can spend what
96:37 - can we get for that and so we don't add
96:39 - all the features we just kind of
96:41 - prioritize like
96:43 - all right we'll do this
96:45 - and then maybe later on if you have the
96:47 - money like come back we'll add the other
96:49 - features so that's that's why i mean my
96:51 - scope creep
96:52 - so like i said for me it's not a problem
96:54 - but since i'm gonna have to maintain it
96:56 - i just have to kind of say like okay
96:59 - how can i build this project knowing
97:02 - that it will probably have new features
97:04 - added later on
97:06 - so i just try to build it from the
97:08 - outset in a way that will be easy to add
97:10 - things onto
97:14 - martin s are react angular and view
97:16 - roughly equally easy to scale and
97:18 - maintain to be honest i can't really
97:21 - answer that because i i don't have much
97:23 - experience with angular or vue
97:27 - from what i know though from what other
97:30 - devs say and from what i've heard
97:33 - they're all
97:37 - they're all pretty easy like
97:39 - they're all nice frameworks they all
97:41 - scale they're all you know somewhat easy
97:43 - to maintain
97:45 - but it does depend on how you build it
97:47 - right you can use react angular review
97:49 - and make a site that's terrible
97:52 - and a mess or you can
97:54 - you know you can use vanilla javascript
97:56 - to make something amazing
97:58 - so it does depend on you know how you
98:00 - build them
98:03 - but i can't really give you like
98:06 - you know something from my experience
98:08 - for angular review though
98:13 - let's see
98:15 - oh okay i didn't i didn't notice that
98:17 - nikki already gave you an answer to the
98:19 - scope creep thing michael so
98:21 - uh sorry for the the double answer there
98:32 - oh world says that makes sense i think
98:34 - the current pope is named after saint
98:36 - francis too yep
98:38 - yep that is that's where he took his
98:40 - name from which was unique he's the
98:42 - first pope to take the name francis
98:46 - let's see
98:48 - michael says please minimize that dev
98:51 - tools window it's kind of hard to
98:53 - concentrate on you
98:57 - oh was i
99:02 - this is the devtools huge
99:04 - sorry
99:06 - um
99:09 - ghana says react with a heart
99:12 - yeah for sure we love react on this this
99:14 - stream
99:18 - i don't say that uh as in
99:21 - to put down any other frameworks i think
99:24 - you know everything has its place and
99:26 - can be useful in different situations
99:28 - but
99:29 - lately we found react to be a very good
99:32 - tool
99:33 - for for what we're doing
99:40 - uh
99:44 - umberto says i think i've slept 19 hours
99:47 - since monday
99:50 - um
99:52 - let's see
99:56 - devex says is c or java better for uh
99:59 - career making
100:01 - uh language
100:02 - in the field
100:04 - um
100:06 - mandela says c sharp and java are good
100:08 - in the usa
100:10 - uh vivec says i think i have to switch
100:13 - to java
100:15 - umberto says which which field for web i
100:18 - would say c-sharp
100:20 - graphics and gaming it's a toss-up
100:22 - between c and c sharp with unity
100:26 - vivek says i'm in university but i want
100:28 - to make a career in a.i
100:30 - so artificial intelligence
100:32 - umberto says for ai python
100:35 - and c
100:36 - c plus plus for robotics
100:39 - vivec says yes i'm learning python but
100:41 - java is currently in my course
100:43 - umberto says java is good foundation for
100:46 - learning object oriented programming
100:48 - really good for establishing principles
100:50 - and patterns and coding
100:52 - in my opinion
100:56 - let's see
101:01 - that's why once
101:03 - let's just see
101:05 - that uh i pretty much agree with
101:06 - umberto's assessment there as well in
101:09 - terms of what
101:11 - uh what languages
101:13 - uh to use like
101:16 - i mean basically you can do
101:20 - you can do a lot in pretty much any
101:22 - language but there are certain languages
101:24 - that seem to be used more
101:26 - uh with with other things like if you're
101:28 - gonna do anything on the web you
101:29 - probably need to learn some javascript
101:32 - um it seems like yeah python is really
101:34 - big in like machine learning ai stuff
101:36 - now so
101:38 - um
101:40 - yeah i guess it just really all depends
101:42 - on what you want to do and
101:44 - what whether you like it's you don't
101:46 - have to do python if you want to get
101:47 - into machine learning or ai like
101:50 - you can do in other languages it
101:54 - i mean the odds of like maybe finding
101:56 - like a company that's into that that's
101:58 - using the language you like might be
102:00 - smaller but
102:02 - if you learn one language well it's not
102:04 - too as difficult to switch to another
102:07 - language
102:09 - so i wouldn't worry too much about what
102:11 - language you're learning
102:14 - because you can't always switch
102:17 - you know i wouldn't say it's like
102:18 - entirely easy to switch but it's a lot
102:20 - easier if you have the basic principles
102:22 - down
102:24 - uh rook says what is the lore mipsum
102:26 - text actually about all latin i got in
102:28 - high school is long gone here
102:31 - um
102:35 - well this lorem ipsum text
102:38 - is bacon ipsum so it's sprinkled in with
102:41 - names of different meats so
102:44 - this probably
102:47 - means nothing
102:49 - i can't remember what the normal laura
102:51 - mipsum is it's a passage from i i
102:54 - believe like uh classic work of
102:57 - literature but i can't remember which
102:59 - so
103:02 - yeah i can't remember which
103:05 - so i did teach latin but that was
103:08 - years ago and i taught ecclesiastical
103:11 - latin
103:12 - so like i can tell you a lot of like um
103:18 - let's say like latin poems and prayers
103:20 - written in the middle ages
103:23 - or
103:25 - certain like passages from
103:28 - um
103:30 - let's say from like the the latin
103:31 - vulgate which is like the latin
103:34 - translation
103:35 - of
103:37 - the bible made in like
103:39 - uh
103:40 - like
103:41 - fifth century fourth century somewhere
103:43 - around there
103:46 - um so
103:47 - when it comes to reading classical latin
103:50 - literature like we're talking like roman
103:52 - empire stuff
103:53 - uh i i'm not
103:56 - i don't really feel at all qualified to
103:57 - to do that kind of thing
104:05 - chris asks why do those fields prefer
104:07 - those particular languages
104:09 - to be honest with you chris i'm not
104:10 - really sure i don't know if there's
104:12 - anything intrinsic to those languages
104:13 - that make them better suited to that or
104:15 - not or it just so happened that kind of
104:18 - the pioneers in those fields use those
104:20 - languages so there's kind of more of an
104:22 - ecosystem build up around them
104:24 - i i don't really know
104:29 - alberto says
104:31 - i believe it's because they were either
104:32 - created specifically for certain
104:34 - platforms or because they work better to
104:36 - tackle problems in in those fields
104:41 - vivek says i want a career in ai and
104:44 - machine learning but c in java in my
104:46 - course and currently i'm learning
104:47 - algorithms so i'm confused
104:50 - uh that i continue with java c
104:55 - uh yet yes
104:56 - sorry if i'm mispronouncing that let me
104:58 - know how i should pronounce it
105:00 - um since i'm planning to make a
105:01 - recommendation system using machine
105:03 - learning and i think python is the only
105:05 - way what do you think about it have you
105:07 - ever done something similar
105:09 - i haven't done anything with machine
105:10 - learning yet i think it's awesome and
105:12 - i'd love to get into it but
105:15 - i'd have to think of some way probably
105:17 - to work it into my current job and then
105:20 - maybe i could really learn it
105:22 - um
105:25 - yeah so i i can't say much about it
105:29 - i think
105:30 - python is fine
105:32 - uh it's a good language i
105:35 - i liked it when i the very little that
105:37 - i've ever done with python i liked it
105:40 - um
105:41 - and
105:42 - i've heard from a lot of a lot of
105:44 - different sources that python is the way
105:46 - to go
105:47 - uh although you can do machine learning
105:49 - in other languages so you're not
105:52 - you're not tied down to python if you
105:54 - really don't want to use it
106:00 - okay alberto says like c c plus plus
106:02 - allows more granular control over memory
106:05 - management okay cool
106:07 - that's that's a good example i really
106:09 - couldn't think of an example but that's
106:11 - an example of how one language might
106:13 - have
106:14 - be good at something and that would
106:16 - matter
106:18 - for a particular application
106:22 - bastawa says good points on react i've
106:24 - heard many times it's overkill haven't
106:26 - used it myself so far do you think
106:29 - is really so
106:31 - uh requested
106:34 - um i see a lot of
106:36 - jobs for react now maybe i'm seeing
106:38 - those jobs because
106:40 - on stack overflow they know that i'm
106:42 - into react and so they show me react
106:44 - jobs it could be that
106:46 - uh but
106:48 - i've i've seen in other places that they
106:51 - say like react jobs are in really high
106:53 - demand right now so
106:57 - um i think you know why not do that and
106:59 - the fact that react so versatile i think
107:02 - is um is a plus as well so some of the
107:04 - sites that we've done before that didn't
107:06 - really need react it was good that we
107:08 - did it with react because now we're
107:09 - converting them to desktop apps and to
107:13 - mobile apps which means we can use react
107:15 - native
107:16 - and it makes it a lot easier to just
107:18 - like port something over
107:21 - uh to to mobile
107:23 - um and then there's also other things
107:25 - you can do with react like you know
107:27 - there are people doing vr stuff and
107:29 - react
107:31 - um trying to think what else was that
107:33 - what else people are doing i don't know
107:34 - i saw a list before of all the things
107:36 - that weird things that people were doing
107:38 - with react
107:39 - and it was it was long there's a lot of
107:41 - stuff
107:42 - so
107:42 - it does have advantages like beyond just
107:46 - what it can do on on the web
107:51 - let's see
107:57 - uh borna says what framework will be
107:59 - best in five years time if we don't look
108:02 - at the ones that will come
108:05 - i don't know i haven't i mean i have no
108:07 - idea
108:10 - how to
108:11 - how to answer that i mean in five years
108:13 - probably all the same languages will
108:14 - still be around
108:16 - maybe we'll have we'll have a new one i
108:19 - i don't really know
108:20 - um
108:23 - yeah who
108:25 - who could know i don't really know
108:31 - divek um about and what's my opinion
108:34 - about java or c
108:36 - i
108:38 - i don't know i've used both
108:40 - very minimally like i'm talking like
108:42 - hello world type stuff
108:44 - um
108:47 - so i don't think i know enough to really
108:49 - have a qualified opinion about either
108:51 - one
109:04 - i'll tell you what it in regard to the
109:06 - question about what will be the best uh
109:08 - what framework will be the best in five
109:10 - years i'm sorry i misread that question
109:12 - i think i misread it at first about what
109:14 - language
109:15 - what framework
109:17 - um
109:18 - yeah i'm in five years i think we'll
109:20 - probably have a new framework
109:23 - but
109:26 - there's gonna be react stuff around just
109:28 - because of and angular because they're
109:30 - companies that invested a lot of money
109:31 - in switching over to that and they're
109:33 - not going to be really happy to
109:34 - completely switch again
109:37 - anytime soon
109:39 - i hope that react is still around and
109:41 - one of the best because
109:43 - if i i'm trying to learn react well and
109:45 - then it'll be good for me
109:47 - but if it's another one you know i just
109:49 - learned the other one that's that's kind
109:50 - of that's how this business works
109:55 - um let's see
109:57 - yet yeah dave says
109:59 - thanks i have a non-coding question what
110:01 - pc do you have
110:03 - uh and
110:04 - were there any projects where you
110:06 - actually needed a really powerful pc i'm
110:08 - actually on an imac right now
110:10 - uh so my imac has
110:12 - 32
110:15 - gigs of ram
110:16 - i think i upgraded to 32
110:19 - i don't really know what the other specs
110:20 - on it are
110:21 - but i've never had a problem the only
110:23 - issue i've ever had with this is
110:25 - sometimes
110:26 - uh i've dropped some frames if i've had
110:29 - some
110:30 - really uh like kind of heavy things
110:32 - running
110:33 - but in my actual work like i'm talking
110:35 - about the live stream i dropped some
110:37 - frames so with my actual work i've never
110:38 - had an issue
110:40 - trying to live stream and work at the
110:42 - same time i have had an issue
110:44 - um i do have a pc at home but
110:47 - i haven't used it in so long i can't
110:50 - even remember what the specs are on it
110:53 - i have um a macbook pro that i mostly
110:56 - use at home and with that i
110:59 - i tell you i don't really know the specs
111:01 - are either sorry i really
111:03 - i should know more but
111:06 - um
111:08 - i used to be in the like building and
111:10 - like modifying computers and stuff but
111:13 - lately
111:15 - it's harder it's a lot harder to do with
111:16 - macs anyway and i just haven't had a lot
111:18 - of free time to mess around with it at
111:20 - home so nor have i really had the need
111:22 - to
111:23 - the need was mostly like how do i make
111:25 - my computer run games better but i don't
111:27 - really have a lot of time for uh like pc
111:30 - games lately
111:36 - vvx says what type of coding do you do
111:39 - live
111:40 - it's javascript mostly javascript
111:43 - usually with the react
111:46 - library
111:48 - um vivec says what what is react or
111:50 - angular um they're they're a way that
111:53 - you can structure your javascript um to
111:57 - make
111:58 - applications
112:00 - so um
112:03 - yeah i guess that's kind of like the
112:05 - most generic way to
112:07 - uh to answer that that question
112:11 - usually they're made for like single
112:13 - page applications progressive web apps
112:15 - like things like that
112:18 - your encoder says cloud9 is amazing yeah
112:21 - cloud9 is really cool i do like cloud9
112:24 - uh cloud9 is like a like a cloud
112:27 - development environment where you
112:28 - basically have like
112:30 - you're like connected to your own linux
112:32 - machine uh like but in the cloud so you
112:34 - could use it from anywhere
112:36 - um it's really good like if you run a
112:38 - chromebook
112:39 - then cloud9 is the way to go if you want
112:41 - to develop things on a chromebook
112:50 - borna says what do you think about
112:51 - blockchain technology
112:53 - uh greens is tired of hearing about
112:54 - blockchain yeah honestly i think
112:57 - blockchain is going to change a lot of
112:58 - things i think all the hype around
113:00 - blockchain right now um
113:02 - misses the point like the stuff in
113:03 - mainstream media
113:05 - um
113:06 - that blockchain
113:08 - like obviously i have money in some
113:10 - cryptocurrency right like what why not
113:13 - you know
113:14 - um
113:15 - not a lot just a little bit
113:17 - and
113:19 - that's cool all the speculation and the
113:21 - price fluctuations like that stuff's fun
113:23 - but that's not really what blockchain is
113:24 - all about i think the the the idea of
113:27 - having
113:28 - different systems that right now are
113:30 - either controlled by governments or
113:31 - corporations now be trustworthy without
113:34 - having anyone in control
113:36 - that's like a game changer uh when we
113:39 - see like
113:40 - a let's say a country's currency
113:42 - gets destabilized and then all of a
113:44 - sudden like their main method of buying
113:47 - and selling things becomes some form of
113:50 - cryptocurrency
113:52 - like that's a game changer right um
113:55 - now all of a sudden like that government
113:58 - has no control over monetary policy
114:01 - um you know they're out of the currency
114:03 - business like how is that gonna work it
114:05 - change things
114:06 - um how would that then affect like the
114:09 - imports and exports for that country
114:11 - tourism for that country uh it is just
114:14 - so many things that are different
114:17 - uh that are gonna change the same way
114:18 - with like uh social media you could have
114:21 - social media networks that are
114:22 - distributed on blockchain and now one
114:24 - company doesn't
114:26 - decide how things work on there same way
114:29 - for messaging right
114:31 - a government can't go to a company now
114:33 - and demand that they have all the
114:35 - records of whatever somebody said
114:38 - because there is no one to go to
114:41 - so you see there's a lot of stuff and
114:42 - that's you know there's a lot of other
114:44 - implications for that that i think will
114:45 - be
114:46 - like as time goes on
114:48 - it could potentially change
114:51 - um communications and economics like
114:54 - financial systems quite a bit
114:58 - i'm not an expert on blockchain i've
115:00 - just done a little reading on it
115:02 - um borna says absolutely i agree
115:13 - uh green coder says how many hours do
115:15 - you code usually
115:16 - um
115:17 - on my streamer in a day on my stream i
115:19 - usually code for like an hour
115:21 - uh and then do question and answers uh
115:23 - session
115:24 - during a day it does kind of depend on
115:26 - like how many meetings i have and what
115:28 - i'm working on but
115:30 - um
115:32 - i would say
115:34 - average
115:35 - if you count my coding on the stream too
115:37 - maybe like
115:41 - like four out of the seven hours that
115:43 - i'm here
115:44 - i definitely code some days i do more
115:47 - other days especially if i have meetings
115:49 - i do less
115:51 - so i work like a seven hour day so it's
115:53 - like eight hours but with an hour for
115:55 - lunch
115:56 - so
115:57 - within that time period um i'd say i'm
116:00 - like for sure coding um
116:03 - other time is filled up with like
116:06 - talking to my boss um talk like
116:09 - catching up on emails and different
116:11 - things like that
116:13 - maybe like reading about frameworks like
116:15 - documentation and things so
116:18 - um
116:19 - during work now if i have a project on
116:21 - the side at home
116:23 - i could be coding for a lot longer than
116:25 - that
116:30 - vivek says is there any relation between
116:32 - java and javascript
116:33 - uh java and javascript have the same
116:36 - relation as ham and hamster do
116:39 - they just share
116:40 - a similar sounding name and that's it
116:42 - that's it i mean they're both
116:45 - they're both coding
116:46 - um languages but that's it they're both
116:49 - programming languages
116:55 - uh vivec says you have your own company
116:57 - or you're doing a job uh i i'd like kind
117:00 - of have my own side company that i don't
117:02 - do much with at all so jesse weigel
117:05 - digital marketing is is my
117:07 - like kind of like media company um
117:11 - but i don't advertise at all i left the
117:13 - website up but
117:16 - i don't do much i have some clients
117:18 - uh but really minimal work right now
117:22 - um and then i work for a university
117:26 - uh so i'm a front-end developer
117:29 - full-time at university
117:33 - uh
117:34 - at peruva says how to make sure about
117:37 - security for remote work let me know
117:39 - software app for remote work and safety
117:42 - measures
117:43 - um it just kind of depends um for remote
117:47 - stuff like what type of stuff you're
117:49 - doing you're working on
117:50 - um
117:52 - yeah i would say i mean it does it it
117:54 - just really depends
117:55 - honestly i found that the clients are
117:58 - usually way too trusting
118:00 - like i have access to way too much stuff
118:02 - from clients and i just i worry because
118:04 - i'm thinking like if
118:06 - if they do business with somebody who
118:08 - doesn't really have that much of a
118:09 - conscience
118:10 - um they're gonna be in trouble
118:13 - uh generally
118:15 - it i would think like larger companies
118:17 - might
118:18 - i would hope have things better security
118:21 - measures in place but like small
118:22 - business clients
118:24 - they have no idea like you they give you
118:26 - access to everything that they have
118:29 - um
118:31 - because they just don't know they don't
118:32 - know what anything does you just say all
118:34 - right i need passwords and they give you
118:36 - everything
118:37 - plain text over email just here it is
118:40 - um
118:42 - so
118:44 - usually i ask permission and uh
118:46 - sometimes get it to change all the
118:48 - passwords at least to something a bit
118:50 - more secure than
118:52 - normally it's like the name of the
118:53 - business is the password
118:56 - uh so
119:00 - yeah but i i don't know that i don't
119:02 - know how great of an answer that is but
119:03 - that's been my experience with uh like
119:05 - remote
119:06 - freelance work
119:14 - uh bastawa says i have the same uh can't
119:16 - wake up feeling in the morning um and
119:19 - then a night can't get to sleep
119:21 - yeah it's crazy
119:23 - it was crazy how that works
119:26 - uh
119:27 - winkle says what's the best way to learn
119:30 - about react
119:31 - um
119:33 - there are some free resources on
119:35 - codecademy and a lot of free
119:39 - like youtube video resources the react
119:41 - documentation is pretty good as well if
119:44 - you want to pay for a course react has
119:46 - or udacity has a react nanodegree that i
119:49 - did that i liked
119:51 - so
119:53 - that would be my suggestions
119:55 - vivek says how do you earn money well i
119:57 - mean i get a salary from my main job and
119:59 - then
120:00 - you know from my freelancing work i get
120:04 - some money on the side they're really
120:06 - minimal
120:07 - um
120:08 - world says do you use agile at your work
120:10 - is it useful i do something called agile
120:13 - for one so it's not exactly agile but it
120:15 - uses some of the techniques from agile
120:18 - um i find it to be very useful but it's
120:21 - not
120:22 - you can't really do like agile with one
120:25 - person like exactly the same way
120:29 - all right let's see
120:32 - um
120:34 - albert says any senior developers here
120:36 - interested in building a website for 50
120:38 - equity of the company
120:40 - um i am not i don't have the time to do
120:44 - anything right now
120:47 - maybe after i finish this project i have
120:50 - some time freed up
120:52 - nikki says gotta go thanks for the
120:54 - stream uh bye everyone hey see you later
120:57 - thanks for watching
121:01 - all right you have some more questions
121:03 - i'm gonna just take a few more questions
121:04 - i'm after wrap thing things up um vvx
121:08 - says
121:09 - uh okay now a non-technical question how
121:11 - many desktops you have for coding and
121:14 - also you play pc games uh i i code with
121:18 - three screens three monitors
121:21 - my main monitor is uh like a 27 inch i
121:25 - think 27 inch
121:26 - 5k screen my secondary is the same size
121:29 - but it's a 2k and then my third screen
121:32 - is just like a like re lower res screen
121:35 - but i have it tilted on its side
121:38 - um
121:39 - so it's like
121:41 - you know going up and down
121:43 - i used to use four screens when i had my
121:46 - did most of my work at home
121:48 - i i really like that i wish i still had
121:51 - four
121:53 - um
121:54 - bonuses how much is paid course or boot
121:56 - camp worth the udacity uh paid course
121:59 - was
122:00 - four i think four hundred dollars
122:06 - let's see
122:18 - uh rick adams has created a repo with um
122:22 - a road map of resources to learn
122:26 - java php react sql
122:29 - um
122:30 - cool uh that's really cool thanks for uh
122:33 - for letting us know rick
122:35 - um
122:38 - let's see
122:39 - world says that burrito is probably
122:41 - frozen now yeah i'm gonna have to warm
122:42 - it up
122:43 - um
122:51 - says i know mean stack uh how useful is
122:54 - react how much time we'll learn to take
122:56 - i don't know it um
123:03 - i don't really know it really depends on
123:04 - everybody learns at a different rate so
123:06 - i mean if you're pretty
123:08 - pretty good with javascript you know you
123:10 - could probably pick up react you know
123:12 - pretty really quickly if you can spend
123:13 - the time on it so
123:15 - i don't really want to put a time frame
123:17 - on it because it's just so many factors
123:18 - to take into account
123:20 - um
