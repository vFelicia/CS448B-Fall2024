00:00 - let's talk about list comprehensions in
00:02 - Python this is a very easy and concise
00:04 - way for you to create lists in Python so
00:07 - right here we have two different ways of
00:08 - creating the same list and as you can
00:11 - see this is the traditional way the
00:12 - first thing we do is to create an empty
00:15 - list then we create a for Loop to Loop
00:17 - through from 0 to 10 so we calculate the
00:19 - exponential of two to every single value
00:22 - of x then we append that to this list
00:24 - now I can print
00:27 - this print squares
00:31 - if I run this we can see that we have
00:33 - all the values I'm going to quit
00:37 - this get rid of this bring this back and
00:41 - the other way we can do this is by using
00:42 - list comprehensions so we use this
00:44 - syntax so are saying X exponential of 2
00:48 - for X in range 10 now if I print squares
00:51 - again and I comment all of this once I
00:54 - run this you can see it gives me the
00:55 - same value but it allows us to do it in
00:58 - a concise way
