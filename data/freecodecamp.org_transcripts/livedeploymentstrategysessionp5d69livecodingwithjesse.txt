00:05 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:07 - with jesse i'm jesse and today we're
00:10 - going to do something a little bit
00:12 - different i don't think we've ever
00:14 - dedicated an entire show
00:17 - to planning
00:19 - but it's going to be collaborative
00:21 - planning
00:22 - so i i expect and i hope that there will
00:24 - be a lot of input from you
00:28 - and i'll start out by giving you
00:30 - a rough sketch of what i think we should
00:32 - do to deploy the various parts of this
00:35 - project that we've been working on for
00:38 - for months now
00:40 - um
00:41 - and then
00:43 - i want to get your input
00:44 - to see you know is that plan even
00:46 - reasonable is there something i'm
00:48 - missing like maybe something that could
00:50 - go wrong or some better way to do it and
00:53 - then i'd like to take each piece and
00:55 - come up with a backup plan
00:57 - because you never know what could happen
01:01 - so i want to have a fallback and this
01:03 - will all be in preparation for the
01:05 - upcoming launch in june
01:08 - and i figure once we break things down
01:10 - and have a plan then in future streams
01:14 - we can dedicate a stream to each piece
01:17 - of the plan deploy it all together
01:19 - i'd also like to maybe do some tutorial
01:22 - videos that aren't live that are a
01:24 - little bit more well thought out and
01:26 - don't include all my normal mistakes so
01:29 - after we do a stream
01:31 - uh then and i get it to work then maybe
01:34 - i'll repeat the process with a test
01:36 - you know version and then
01:39 - have that video on my youtube channel
01:41 - that way it'll be a little bit easier
01:43 - for you all to go back and and reference
01:45 - if you want to do it yourself
01:48 - okay so
01:51 - great looks like we're up to a good
01:54 - amount of viewers here
01:56 - so i do want to say
01:57 - last week i didn't stream very much i
01:59 - think only once that's because i was at
02:02 - the revolution conference in virginia
02:04 - beach which was an awesome conference
02:07 - and
02:09 - if anybody gets a chance to go to that
02:10 - conference next year i definitely
02:12 - recommend it one of my favorite
02:14 - conferences uh the people there were
02:16 - very nice and i i attended
02:20 - a whole day of workshops on the second
02:22 - day of the conference and learned some
02:24 - really awesome things like i built an
02:26 - alexa skill
02:27 - uh which actually got accepted and it's
02:29 - live now
02:32 - so it's just a basic skill called weird
02:34 - and weird in fact it's w-e-i-r-t-o-n
02:38 - we're 10 facts and weirdtoon is my
02:40 - hometown so it just gives you some you
02:43 - know random facts about my hometown so
02:45 - that was kind of my first
02:47 - first alexa skill kept it really simple
02:50 - and then in my other workshop that's
02:52 - where i got a lot of the ideas that i'm
02:53 - going to share with you
02:55 - today
02:57 - so
02:59 - shout out to
03:02 - francisca i don't remember her last name
03:05 - no
03:06 - um
03:08 - you know what i i gave her a shout out
03:10 - in the tweet my latest tweet so check it
03:12 - out if you want to see her name but she
03:13 - works for google and she gave an awesome
03:15 - workshop on a lot of google cloud stuff
03:18 - and
03:19 - we built a little
03:21 - a little node app
03:23 - on google cloud so
03:27 - you can
03:28 - check out that tweet if you want to know
03:30 - more about her
03:32 - and
03:34 - i think we're going to get started so
03:36 - the way i'm going to do this i'm going
03:37 - to set a pomodoro timer during that time
03:40 - we're just going to talk about and
03:41 - discuss things related to deployment if
03:43 - you have any other questions like
03:45 - general coding questions or really
03:46 - anything in general you want to know my
03:48 - favorite color go ahead and ask it but
03:50 - i'm going to save those questions for
03:52 - our five-minute breaks and then i'll
03:54 - save it for the very end of the stream
03:55 - once we get through all the deployment
03:57 - stuff
03:58 - and then that way that'll help us stay
04:00 - focused a little bit but
04:02 - you shouldn't have to wait too long to
04:03 - get your question
04:04 - answered
04:07 - oh awesome
04:09 - um
04:11 - francisca is is here i hope i'm
04:14 - pronouncing your first name right let me
04:15 - know if i'm not i i really would like to
04:18 - pronounce it right
04:19 - and uh great so if i mess anything up in
04:22 - terms of google cloud stuff i hopefully
04:25 - uh you know you'll be able to correct me
04:28 - there so let me start this pomodoro
04:30 - session
04:31 - if you're not familiar with pomodoro
04:32 - session it's
04:33 - it can vary a bit but it's usually 25
04:35 - minutes with a five minute break
04:40 - all right so i'm just gonna do this in
04:41 - markdown i thought about opening up uh
04:44 - google doc or something to kind of mark
04:46 - down my my plans or write up the plans
04:49 - but i thought hey like we do coding why
04:50 - not do it in vs code and markdown
04:53 - uh
04:54 - so um it'll look prettier on the right
04:58 - hand side so if you follow along you can
05:00 - check that out
05:02 - and
05:04 - here's i'm gonna go down through and
05:07 - just give you my
05:10 - my vision for how this is going to
05:11 - deploy so let's take that react part
05:14 - first so we have our react project
05:16 - which is
05:18 - you know node we have express running uh
05:21 - we we built that out with next js
05:24 - um we're using apollo for graphql so if
05:27 - you all seen any of the streams you know
05:29 - you know how that is we've already
05:30 - successfully deployed it
05:32 - using now
05:34 - which is from the same company that
05:36 - makes js it's zeit
05:39 - so
05:39 - that's a really easy deployment it
05:42 - scales it's fast
05:44 - i want to use that because then that
05:45 - takes away the burden of server
05:47 - maintenance
05:49 - i love the fact that it
05:50 - scales so it should be able to handle
05:53 - whatever traffic and updating things is
05:56 - super easy there's no downtime
05:58 - so that's the the strategy now so
06:02 - let's go and do
06:05 - a small heading
06:07 - for all these subplants so let's just
06:08 - call this the
06:11 - the react app we'll do a small heading
06:14 - and then we're just going to do a list
06:15 - we're going to say now
06:19 - is is going to be our deployment so that
06:20 - one's pretty simple
06:22 - uh i think that one is is not really
06:24 - going to be where the debate's at
06:25 - although
06:29 - uh nikki says is your mic pointed at
06:31 - your pc
06:33 - okay you know what my mic did fall down
06:35 - a bit it came loose so i didn't notice
06:38 - it until you just said that
06:39 - let me
06:40 - there we go i hope that's better
06:44 - i'm gonna move it a bit closer to me as
06:46 - well and away from my my computer all
06:49 - right cool so that should be better
06:50 - sorry about that
06:52 - um
06:53 - i'm going to do my best to keep my eye
06:55 - on the live chat to see if there's
06:57 - anything related to our deployment
07:02 - all right so now the next part we're
07:04 - gonna do
07:05 - uh so let's do react the next part is
07:07 - gonna be our
07:10 - our database so
07:14 - my
07:17 - so we have a mysql database and i'll go
07:19 - in and fill out the rest here
07:31 - files
07:42 - okay so this is a good layout for kind
07:44 - of the structure of what we'll need so
07:47 - for our mysql database right now
07:51 - it's linked up on a digital ocean
07:53 - droplet so we have one droplet it's just
07:55 - a cheap five dollar droplet and it has
07:58 - our wordpress installation
08:00 - any files associated with that
08:03 - and then it also has the mysql database
08:06 - all right there
08:08 - so
08:10 - i don't want to keep it like that the
08:12 - reason being uh well obviously a five
08:14 - dollar droplet is not going to do it
08:16 - we'd have to increase the size of the
08:18 - droplets significantly but then that
08:20 - also provides us with a single point of
08:23 - failure
08:24 - we could stay in digital ocean and one
08:27 - option that i have thought of and this
08:28 - could probably be our backup
08:30 - is
08:32 - to use
08:33 - multiple droplets
08:35 - so we would have multiple instances
08:39 - of my sequel
08:41 - and wordpress
08:43 - and load balance between them and then
08:45 - somehow make sure they're all in sync at
08:48 - all times
08:50 - to me that's a lot of work for some and
08:53 - it's something that i've never attempted
08:54 - before so that's why i say
08:57 - probably better for a backup
08:59 - um
09:01 - oh no
09:03 - i'm not showing my screen
09:07 - i'm sorry anyway
09:10 - here's what i've been typing
09:13 - so sorry i'm just i'm really excited
09:15 - about this so i i'm forgetting little
09:18 - things
09:19 - okay so here's where we're at so for our
09:21 - react app we're gonna use now as our
09:24 - primary and uh we'll we'll also come up
09:27 - with some a backup for that as well
09:29 - so
09:31 - there we are thank you for saying
09:33 - something who said steven said i can't
09:35 - see the layout uh who can't see okay so
09:38 - it looks like a lot of you said you
09:40 - can't see the layout oh so sorry
09:43 - um it's been a while since i've done
09:45 - that one
09:46 - uh
09:47 - forgotten to show the screen but it
09:49 - happens you think after a year doing
09:51 - live streams over a year now i would
09:53 - remember that but
09:55 - still don't
09:56 - okay so
09:58 - to solve the complexity issues of having
10:01 - multiple databases and trying to keep
10:03 - them in sync i thought why not go with
10:06 - one of these cloud hosted database
10:09 - services so there are several
10:11 - options out there
10:14 - because i did a workshop with google
10:17 - cloud
10:18 - i think it would be easier for me and
10:20 - i'd be a little bit more comfortable if
10:22 - i went with google's uh cloud sql
10:25 - uh stuff so let me show you what i'm
10:27 - talking about and i'll paste the link in
10:29 - for you
10:31 - because i have this up
10:34 - at least i did have it up
10:38 - where is it at
10:40 - i hope i didn't close it out oh no here
10:42 - it is
10:44 - uh let me go back i'm actually in the
10:47 - console to start setting it up so i want
10:49 - to back up and go to just kind of like
10:51 - the sales page and info page for it
10:54 - so
10:56 - here's what what i'm talking about when
10:59 - i'm talking about the cloud sql okay so
11:01 - it's a part of google cloud
11:04 - and
11:05 - i'm going to paste this into the chat
11:07 - the live chat so you all can check it
11:09 - out if you want
11:15 - and
11:16 - if if you click on that and it doesn't
11:18 - take you the right place please try
11:19 - copying and pasting it
11:21 - there's often some issues with the links
11:23 - if you paste them into the live chat
11:26 - so
11:27 - this would definitely work we're
11:28 - obviously going to go with the my sequel
11:31 - option
11:33 - but here's what i a few of the parts
11:35 - that really stood out to me as to why i
11:36 - want to do with with this
11:39 - um
11:40 - fully managed right
11:43 - so
11:43 - automatic backups
11:45 - right that's that's awesome
11:47 - automatic updates
11:49 - right those are two big things that we
11:52 - need to have that i won't have to worry
11:54 - about anymore and uh you all that have
11:57 - been watching for a while you know that
11:58 - it
11:59 - i get pulled off projects and onto other
12:01 - projects and have deadlines so
12:04 - it's very easy for me to forget
12:06 - stuff like that
12:08 - that really nobody else is gonna nobody
12:10 - hire up and is gonna say like make sure
12:12 - you do those updates they're not even
12:14 - gonna realize we need updates or we need
12:17 - backups or anything the only time
12:18 - anybody is gonna be worried about that
12:20 - is if something wrong happens and then
12:22 - they'll say well didn't we have any
12:23 - backups
12:25 - so having that taken care of is going to
12:27 - just
12:28 - free up so much time and worry from me
12:31 - so that alone i think makes it worth it
12:34 - but also
12:35 - the performance like i doubt i'm going
12:37 - to be able to match that performance
12:39 - if i just stick with setting up my own
12:42 - droplets
12:44 - same way with reliability i love this so
12:47 - digitalocean
12:50 - as far as i know i haven't researched
12:52 - myself but a colleague of mine here has
12:55 - researched the security certificates on
12:57 - digitalocean and they
13:00 - are okay but they definitely don't
13:02 - rise to this level of security so i mean
13:06 - look we we're not going to do anything
13:07 - hipaa related but if we wanted to we'd
13:09 - even be good for hipaa if you're not
13:11 - familiar with that here in the united
13:12 - states at least uh if you're doing
13:15 - anything with people's medical data you
13:17 - need to be hipaa compliant so it's it's
13:19 - kind of a pretty high level of
13:22 - security that's required so basically we
13:24 - have all these certificates and more if
13:27 - you dig into the documentation there's
13:28 - even more certificates that i can
13:30 - present to auditors when they come in
13:32 - or let's say like the head of the it
13:34 - department here and say
13:37 - you know if there's ever any question
13:38 - about well how we set this up i can say
13:41 - listen
13:42 - all of the data we have for this site
13:45 - is in a secure place you know it's
13:48 - these certificates are provided so
13:50 - that's it's not always a big deal
13:52 - depending on who your client is or what
13:54 - you're working on but here in this
13:55 - setting we do go through uh
13:58 - data security audits and things so it's
14:00 - it's definitely important for me to have
14:02 - that
14:03 - okay so
14:06 - that's just a little overview
14:08 - i'm going to check the live chat see if
14:10 - there's any questions
14:18 - all right i don't see anything yet which
14:20 - i mean which is okay i guess it's good
14:22 - so i guess that means what i've been
14:23 - saying so far makes sense
14:25 - so
14:26 - we're gonna we're gonna go over here and
14:28 - i'm going to say
14:30 - google cloud
14:32 - sql will be our option one
14:36 - whoops click in the wrong place
14:46 - okay so that's going to be our option
14:48 - and i want you all to think of some
14:49 - backups because i told you a backup that
14:51 - i thought of doing but realistically i
14:55 - i don't want to have to do that with
14:57 - with the short amount of time we have
14:58 - until launch i'm not confident
15:01 - that i can get that working
15:03 - reliably
15:05 - in that amount of time
15:07 - um okay
15:09 - now we also have wordpress right so for
15:12 - wordpress it's currently on that same
15:14 - digital ocean droplet that we talked
15:15 - about a few minutes ago
15:19 - um
15:21 - okay we did just so phoenix just said
15:23 - you tweeted that you want to discuss
15:25 - something from revconf here yeah so
15:27 - the ideas that i'm getting for the cloud
15:30 - sql database and then also down here for
15:32 - the files and images which we haven't
15:34 - gone over yet i got those ideas from
15:37 - um
15:38 - francisca's
15:40 - workshop
15:41 - at revconf so that's what i want to talk
15:43 - to you mainly about if anybody has any
15:45 - other questions about refcoff let me
15:47 - know we can get to those later i'm
15:48 - thinking about maybe doing a recap video
15:50 - from revconf and putting it on my
15:52 - youtube channel links in the description
15:55 - so
15:56 - i'd love to do that as soon as i can
15:59 - realistically though uh i will be very
16:01 - busy until the site launches so i can't
16:03 - promise you that that will come out soon
16:06 - but i'd like to i'd like to at least
16:08 - make the video while it's still fresh in
16:10 - my mind
16:11 - uh
16:12 - okay so for the wordpress here's what
16:14 - i'm thinking alright i've never done
16:16 - this before
16:18 - but
16:19 - as far as i know it is possible
16:23 - to host
16:25 - wordpress
16:26 - with now
16:28 - so if you're not familiar with now
16:33 - essentially
16:39 - all right from from my perspective from
16:40 - a user's perspective with now
16:44 - a user being like the developer right
16:46 - who's using now as a service
16:48 - you type in a command on the command
16:50 - line and your site is launched
16:52 - that's it
16:54 - it's that easy if you want your site to
16:56 - use a custom url which we will it's just
16:58 - another command
17:00 - super easy deployments right so that's
17:03 - the benefit of now and then
17:05 - you don't have to worry about the server
17:08 - uh managing a server or anything like
17:09 - that it takes care of scaling all that
17:12 - so
17:14 - we're already using this successfully
17:16 - for a react app
17:19 - but for wordpress what we need though is
17:21 - to decouple from wordpress
17:24 - not only the database
17:26 - but also the files
17:28 - okay so to be honest with you i'm not a
17:31 - hundred percent certain that we have to
17:32 - decouple the files but i assume that you
17:35 - would have to
17:36 - uh and i want to i've wanted to anyway
17:40 - um
17:42 - so
17:44 - our my first idea here to go with this
17:47 - is plan a is going to be used now
17:52 - and i'm just going to say uh
17:54 - backup
17:55 - our backup plan is going to be
18:00 - digitalocean
18:03 - and if you all come up with any better
18:05 - backup plans please let me know but
18:07 - we can still
18:10 - take out the files the database and
18:12 - everything and go with digitalocean
18:15 - and uh just do load balancing on
18:18 - digitalocean they set up so you can do
18:20 - automatic load balancing
18:22 - we did that for way back for project one
18:24 - last year and that that worked we didn't
18:27 - use it with wordpress we used it with
18:28 - react but it did work so at least we
18:30 - know how to set up the load balancing
18:32 - there
18:33 - so i think this is a decent backup
18:36 - but not ideal due to some of the things
18:38 - that
18:40 - um that i mentioned earlier okay so that
18:44 - leaves our our final
18:46 - our final thing here are the files so
18:48 - there's two big reasons why i think we
18:51 - should host the files somewhere other
18:53 - than you know on a droplet uh tightly
18:56 - coupled there to our wordpress install
18:59 - number one
19:00 - we need to migrate a ton of files from
19:04 - the old system
19:06 - which is based on ektron
19:08 - and is currently hosted on campus here
19:11 - just a few buildings away
19:14 - so i need to be able to store those
19:17 - somewhere else
19:19 - and keep the file structure
19:23 - it's i could do that on digital ocean i
19:26 - would have to get extra storage for the
19:28 - droplet though
19:29 - um and then
19:31 - again there's the the whole management
19:34 - of it right i still have to manage that
19:36 - number two
19:38 - is when i want a user when a user is
19:40 - going to upload a file to wordpress
19:43 - right so whether that be me
19:45 - or somebody else
19:47 - in my department or even users from
19:49 - other departments that we're going to
19:51 - train over the course of this next year
19:53 - after this launches we're going to train
19:54 - go department by department do training
19:57 - give them their own wordpress accounts
19:59 - limited access so they can update their
20:01 - own content
20:02 - they're going to want to upload
20:04 - documents
20:05 - and images
20:08 - i don't want those to just go on the
20:09 - droplet
20:10 - you know let's say
20:12 - it gets out of hand people start
20:14 - uploading a ton of really big things
20:16 - it could take up the space on a droplet
20:18 - quickly i don't want to go overkill and
20:20 - pay for a ton of space but i also don't
20:22 - want to
20:23 - get taken off guard
20:25 - and
20:26 - fill up all the space in my droplet so
20:29 - something like
20:31 - google's cloud storage buckets
20:34 - i think would work better
20:36 - it would give us more flexibility in
20:38 - terms of storage and it would have
20:41 - availability so let me show you what i'm
20:43 - thinking
20:44 - with google's
20:46 - cloud storage so
20:49 - again i
20:50 - have the documentation open and not like
20:52 - the sales page so let me go back to
20:56 - the sales page here
20:58 - the sales page has like the main points
21:00 - that you want and the nice looking
21:02 - graphics so that's why i'm going with
21:04 - that
21:04 - um
21:05 - products let's see
21:08 - storage
21:10 - cloud storage
21:16 - i think i'm still partially in the
21:18 - documentation part of it
21:26 - these cases features good features
21:33 - no
21:34 - [Music]
21:36 - all right i was kind of hoping for
21:38 - [Music]
21:39 - a different page
21:41 - let me see
21:45 - oh well i'll just go back to the page i
21:47 - was on i i think it's fresh enough in my
21:49 - mind that i can explain this a little
21:51 - bit more
21:52 - without it
21:54 - and i did actually have a storage bucket
21:57 - that i created from the
21:59 - uh
22:00 - from the conference from the workshop
22:02 - that we could go to if i need to get
22:03 - into it a little more i don't really
22:05 - want to get into technical stuff but
22:07 - just say like
22:08 - um
22:10 - essentially you could see
22:12 - the prices
22:14 - think of like
22:15 - think of dropbox or google drive or
22:19 - microsoft onedrive right think of that
22:23 - but being able
22:24 - to drop all your files in there and have
22:27 - them available for consumption
22:29 - at a url for websites
22:34 - that's that's kind of like what we have
22:36 - here and
22:37 - we're paying
22:39 - a price per gigabyte per month
22:42 - okay which i love that so that means
22:45 - we pay for what we have in there
22:48 - if we put more in there we pay more but
22:50 - we're not we don't have like this fixed
22:52 - limit which is what i was afraid of i
22:55 - don't want to overpay and i also don't
22:57 - want to get stuck so this will allow us
22:59 - to scale nicely
23:01 - uh i can come in on a regular basis and
23:04 - clean things up if i need to and say
23:06 - like yeah we don't need five of these
23:08 - images or so and so uploaded like this
23:12 - gigantic 5k video or something crazy
23:15 - uh and we definitely don't need that
23:19 - uh so
23:21 - i i love that
23:24 - and i love the fact that i don't have to
23:27 - worry about
23:29 - like backups
23:31 - i don't have to worry about
23:33 - um
23:34 - like providing for that on my on my own
23:37 - like maintenance
23:38 - to that server
23:40 - it's it's taken care of
23:42 - so this is
23:44 - since i work with this already at
23:47 - revconf i feel more confident working
23:49 - with google's product
23:51 - i know amazon offers similar uh product
23:55 - i assume microsoft does i'm not 100 sure
23:58 - though
23:59 - but i think given the timeline i could
24:01 - probably set this up more quickly
24:04 - than i could
24:06 - otherwise my department already has a
24:08 - google account set up
24:10 - with billing attached so i just need to
24:12 - make sure and talk to some people who
24:13 - understand how the billing process works
24:16 - here i try to keep myself out of that
24:18 - because it's just a lot of extra
24:19 - paperwork so i got to talk to my
24:21 - colleague and make sure that
24:24 - uh
24:25 - we don't get in trouble first for
24:27 - setting up this account but i'd like to
24:29 - set that up soon and i'd like to do that
24:31 - on the live stream coming up soon
24:34 - uh so i'm just going to go with
24:37 - on here i'm going to say google cloud
24:39 - storage
24:44 - okay so
24:46 - these are mostly just
24:48 - like the plans plan a right we still
24:51 - need our plan b's our backup plans
24:54 - so that's kind of what i want to discuss
24:56 - whether or not number one whether or not
24:58 - these plan plan a's are any good
25:02 - or if there's something i'm missing and
25:04 - then number two
25:06 - what should plan b b
25:08 - especially if any of you have used any
25:09 - of this stuff for something similar on a
25:11 - real project i definitely want your uh
25:14 - your input
25:16 - i'm gonna check my timer too so we got
25:18 - about five minutes and then i'll get to
25:19 - some of the questions that are unrelated
25:22 - uh let me scroll up a bit make sure i
25:24 - haven't
25:25 - missed anything
25:30 - let's see
25:40 - six
25:47 - all right so so far i haven't had any
25:50 - comments on this um
25:53 - outline okay so
25:55 - uh arunesh says aws s3 should be good s3
25:59 - is the storage stuff right
26:02 - you know how aws is and you don't you
26:04 - don't know what anything means
26:06 - if somebody already hasn't made a
26:08 - browser plug-in that translate aws's
26:11 - names into something more reasonable
26:14 - then you should somebody should make it
26:16 - maybe i'll try to make it but
26:19 - i did work with some aws stuff as well
26:22 - when i did that alexa skill workshop
26:25 - um
26:27 - realistically though i think if if i'm
26:29 - gonna use google cloud sql and google
26:32 - cloud storage that's fine if i'm gonna
26:34 - switch and do something with amazon with
26:36 - aws i'd rather do aws for both
26:40 - because that's just one less account
26:41 - that i have to worry about managing
26:46 - so i'm open to it i just want to know
26:50 - what are the differences between going
26:51 - with aws and that that's amazon web
26:54 - services if you're not familiar with the
26:56 - uh with the name
26:58 - so
26:59 - going with amazon versus going with
27:01 - google
27:03 - what are the
27:04 - differences uh is there any
27:08 - good reason to go with one or the other
27:13 - let's see okay nikki says
27:15 - uh
27:16 - nikki doesn't have experience
27:19 - but heard uh westboss uh and scott
27:23 - tolinski talk about cloudanry for image
27:26 - storage on the syntax podcast
27:29 - uh nikki also says that's a great
27:31 - podcast you know what i haven't listened
27:32 - to that one yet i'll have to add that
27:34 - to my podcast actually i do want to give
27:37 - a shout out to um
27:39 - the
27:40 - tales from the script podcast uh so the
27:43 - guy who does that podcast i got to meet
27:46 - him and hang out with him at revconf and
27:49 - super nice guy
27:50 - so check that out also there's a podcast
27:52 - called
27:54 - dark net diaries if you're interested in
27:56 - like hackers and things like that
27:59 - in security check out darknet diaries
28:01 - podcast i binge listened to that on the
28:04 - way back from revconf and i listened to
28:06 - every episode
28:07 - it was that good
28:09 - so definitely check that out
28:13 - okay arnesh says
28:15 - aws s3 which is their storage
28:18 - has a good backup strategy okay all
28:20 - right that's cool definitely need to
28:22 - look into that
28:24 - steven says westboss likes cloudnary a
28:28 - lot i wonder
28:31 - now i'm just saying i i have no proof of
28:33 - this but
28:34 - if they mention cloudnary a lot on their
28:37 - podcast are they getting referral credit
28:39 - or something for cloudnery
28:42 - um
28:43 - that doesn't mean culinary's not good it
28:46 - just makes me wonder
28:56 - okay back we got another suggestion
28:58 - called backblaze
29:00 - arnesh says aws s3 is the cheapest
29:06 - oh nikki says yes they are they are
29:08 - sponsored and are upfront about it okay
29:18 - okay let me uh mark down some of these
29:21 - suggestions for our storage here so
29:24 - we're going to add
29:27 - as potential options
29:34 - aws s3 we're also going to add
29:37 - cloudinary
29:40 - and then the last one that was mentioned
29:42 - i've never heard of before uh back
29:45 - blaze
29:48 - back blaze okay so
29:51 - these are gonna be our options that we
29:54 - need to look into
29:56 - i don't have a ton of time to spend on
29:58 - researching this so i'm just going to
30:00 - look into them a little bit more so if
30:02 - you all have some reasons why you would
30:04 - recommend one over all the others let me
30:07 - know that would be very helpful
30:11 - let's see
30:17 - oh let me
30:18 - i'm going to do the five minute break
30:19 - right now so
30:21 - during this five minute break i'm going
30:22 - to answer any questions that are
30:24 - unrelated to our current topic after
30:26 - that we're going to reset the timer
30:28 - we're going to get back to the
30:29 - discussion make sure we have
30:31 - backup plans for each one of the things
30:33 - the pieces that need to deploy
30:38 - all right so we have a lot of people
30:39 - saying hi i'm not gonna go through
30:40 - everybody but if you did say hi i'm
30:42 - saying hi back to you right now i do see
30:44 - all the hellos
30:48 - let's see
30:52 - oh nikki uh said uh just published uh
30:55 - part two of uh fresh dev environment
30:59 - blog post so cool everybody check that
31:01 - out if you
31:02 - can michael says you remember when your
31:05 - boss used to go away to team building
31:08 - conference i've got a feeling this is
31:10 - going to be like that
31:22 - who some asked if i would make an
31:23 - algorithm course uh i could i tell you
31:26 - truth i might not be the best person to
31:28 - make an algorithm course
31:31 - i mean i've i've done them
31:33 - successfully but
31:35 - uh i that wouldn't be top on my list of
31:37 - things i would feel confident that i
31:40 - could contribute something but i'm open
31:42 - to it i'll uh definitely add that to the
31:44 - list of potential
31:46 - video tutorials and things that i could
31:48 - make
32:01 - let's see
32:17 - uh okay michael's uh
32:20 - michael who's with us frequently on the
32:21 - live stream is having trouble with his
32:23 - internet which that's that really stinks
32:26 - sorry about if you're still with us
32:28 - sorry about that michael if you if you
32:30 - can't watch it now but you can watch it
32:32 - later on uh you know definitely just put
32:35 - your input into the comments or dm me or
32:37 - something and uh i i would still
32:40 - appreciate you your opinion on these
32:42 - things
32:54 - okay uh rick adams says which book and
32:57 - or video titles
32:59 - uh
33:01 - are
33:02 - recommended for a thorough base of
33:05 - software development regarding object
33:07 - oriented programming
33:09 - sql or sql depending how you like to say
33:12 - it
33:13 - um
33:14 - rbdb
33:15 - design and scripting in java
33:18 - oh i don't i don't really know
33:21 - uh
33:22 - you know because i don't deal with
33:25 - like java
33:26 - at all
33:29 - and i minimally deal with sql
33:32 - and realistically like
33:34 - you know uh with react
33:36 - we're not really doing object-oriented
33:38 - programming
33:40 - so
33:44 - i don't really know does anyone else
33:45 - have any
33:47 - suggestions for books or videos
33:49 - on those topics if you do please let us
33:51 - know in the live chat or if you're
33:53 - watching later on please throw it in the
33:55 - comments to the video
34:08 - phoenix said i once listened to that
34:10 - meaning the dark net diaries podcast and
34:13 - never again since i started having
34:15 - thoughts about the dark about darknet
34:17 - bad thoughts
34:20 - yeah well if you've ever been tempted to
34:22 - be uh you know a bad hacker then um
34:25 - maybe that's not the show for you it'd
34:27 - be too tempting
34:35 - uh lawson arts3 asks what's the question
34:39 - uh basically our question now is
34:43 - what are the best ways to handle these
34:45 - different pieces of the deployment that
34:47 - we need to do
34:48 - for our current project that's project
34:50 - five in this video series
34:53 - um so
34:56 - in particular if you have any opinion
34:58 - about any of these products for file
35:00 - storage you know please let let me know
35:08 - francisco says as far as i know on
35:10 - standard products like stores the large
35:12 - providers are all equally good and
35:13 - similarly priced it's probably simpler
35:16 - if you have one provider for all your
35:18 - services
35:19 - okay cool yeah i definitely agree on
35:20 - having one provider
35:22 - for all the services so
35:25 - uh and thank you for that
35:29 - let's see
35:32 - okay so
35:33 - cloud storage uh azure is expensive
35:38 - okay so azure is
35:40 - maybe we didn't even have that as an
35:42 - option so i'm not going to add it in
35:43 - right now nobody really suggested it
35:46 - but that would be microsoft's version of
35:49 - this
35:51 - joshua asked why i'm using wordpress for
35:53 - the front end we're not using wordpress
35:55 - for the front end react is the front end
35:57 - wordpress is just handling our content
35:58 - management i needed something that
36:01 - uh
36:02 - was very user friendly for the people
36:04 - that are gonna have to edit this because
36:05 - we're going to have a lot of people that
36:07 - have no coding experience
36:09 - editing this
36:10 - uh so wordpress
36:13 - does provide that i think a pretty
36:16 - pretty simple user experience and it
36:18 - also has a huge
36:19 - uh community of developers
36:22 - you know that i can reach out to if i
36:25 - need help to customize some things
36:27 - i do have somewhat of a background in
36:29 - wordpress as well when i freelanced i
36:31 - used to do a lot of wordpress sites
36:32 - because it seems like every small
36:34 - business has a wordpress site
36:37 - all right
36:39 - let's go back and we'll do one more
36:41 - pomodoro session we may not even take
36:43 - the whole session and then i'll go back
36:45 - and make sure i've answered all the
36:46 - questions here
36:49 - uh but i want to to go back and fill
36:52 - this list out a little bit more
36:55 - so keep it coming with all the ideas
36:57 - definitely appreciate it i've already
36:59 - had a few ideas that i never thought of
37:01 - because i've never heard of these
37:02 - services
37:13 - let's see
37:24 - let's see
37:36 - all right uh lawson says all i know
37:38 - about them is aws seems
37:41 - aws is the most solid choice not
37:43 - considering price or firebase is from
37:46 - what i've seen
37:48 - okay yeah so firebase being a google
37:51 - product i don't think we'll need
37:54 - firebase though uh
37:57 - i mean we're because we definitely
37:58 - already have the data in a sql database
38:01 - so i would don't
38:03 - i don't want to convert you know i don't
38:05 - want to switch it over but
38:07 - um so that's why i'd rather go with a
38:09 - you know cloud sql
38:12 - amazon does have something similar as
38:14 - well so we could go with that
38:26 - okay harsh it's here hey how's it going
38:27 - harsh it
38:29 - uh as you can see on the screen these
38:31 - are
38:32 - uh some of the options that we're going
38:34 - with for deployment for each part
38:37 - of our
38:38 - of our project so if you have any
38:40 - opinion on any of these please
38:42 - let me know
38:47 - okay so
38:49 - keep the suggestions coming i think i've
38:51 - gotten through all of them
38:53 - i want to talk a little bit about backup
38:55 - plans for some of these
38:57 - so
38:59 - for our react app
39:02 - we may be able to go with
39:06 - if we can't go with now
39:08 - for whatever reason
39:10 - i'm i'm not going to speculate on why
39:12 - let's let's just say it we can't go with
39:14 - now
39:15 - our backup of course could be
39:21 - load balanced
39:29 - digital ocean droplets okay why digital
39:31 - ocean well we already have an account
39:33 - with digitalocean so that would be
39:36 - faster but realistically
39:38 - could we do something with a different
39:39 - provider yeah we definitely could um
39:43 - you know
39:44 - amazon google microsoft
39:47 - or any other number of providers we
39:49 - could probably do the same thing for i
39:51 - like that digitalocean has a really easy
39:54 - load balancing built in i don't have
39:56 - enough experience with other options to
39:58 - know if their load balancing is
40:00 - as easy
40:02 - okay but
40:03 - this takes a little bit more work
40:05 - we would have to keep up with the
40:07 - updates and maintenance on all these
40:08 - servers so that's why that's definitely
40:10 - a backup plan
40:14 - if anybody has any other options for
40:16 - backup plans that may be better than
40:18 - that please let me know
40:20 - it says
40:21 - let's see
40:36 - okay bo bo's here i didn't see uh so bo
40:39 - karns who does uh a ton of stuff for the
40:42 - free code camp youtube channel is here
40:44 - uh so good to have you here
40:52 - and we have some more
40:54 - uh
40:55 - opinions on what we should do here so
40:58 - um
41:00 - quinny's says digitalocean has spaces
41:03 - with backups as data storage as well
41:05 - doesn't it
41:06 - you know what i believe they do so i i
41:08 - do believe digitalocean has
41:10 - the data storage uh backups and things
41:13 - too
41:14 - so maybe you know what maybe we should
41:16 - add digitalocean here as well as an
41:19 - option makes sense we already have an
41:21 - account with them
41:24 - and i believe
41:26 - someone else in my department has used
41:28 - the storage in digitalocean so i'll be
41:30 - able to talk to them and see
41:33 - what they thought of it
41:43 - uh
41:44 - bovin says are you looking uh also
41:48 - looking for network latency problem many
41:50 - times we experience in some regions of
41:52 - the world
41:53 - websites load very slow due to network
41:56 - latency
41:57 - uh well yeah
41:59 - i'm
42:00 - i definitely want to avoid latency as
42:02 - much as possible uh i'm not sure
42:06 - other than trying to make my site as
42:08 - small and fast as possible i'm not sure
42:11 - what else i could do
42:13 - in in terms of helping with network
42:15 - latency
42:20 - matt duchess says perfect timing for
42:22 - this topic working on mine thanks
42:24 - you're welcome i'm i'm glad hopefully
42:26 - this will be helpful to you
42:28 - oh okay stephen has a in a very reliable
42:32 - kind of old school
42:34 - uh
42:36 - method here
42:37 - steven says how about a couple of thumb
42:39 - drives and dvd-r
42:42 - archives yeah we could add that in the
42:45 - mix right
42:46 - you know
42:48 - it'll def it'll be totally offline we
42:50 - don't have to worry about hackers
42:51 - getting in stealing or corrupting our
42:53 - data right
42:59 - that would be actually hilarious just to
43:01 - have like a little piece of artwork
43:02 - hanging in my office that are like
43:05 - the entire website and thumb drives or
43:07 - something like that
43:10 - maybe i'll have it in glass that says
43:12 - break in case of emergency
43:15 - just
43:22 - harshit says by the way you will be
43:23 - working using docker for wordpress now
43:26 - yes
43:27 - so that's
43:28 - let me
43:31 - let me just show you a little bit of the
43:33 - details about how this would would need
43:35 - to work
43:37 - so
43:37 - i've already forked the example
43:41 - um for how to use wordpress with now
43:45 - so if you check out this fus marcom here
43:48 - i'll give you a link to it uh so our
43:50 - organization that we've been building
43:51 - our all our stuff and now has a fork of
43:54 - this so that we can modify it if we need
43:56 - to
43:57 - but basically yes we
44:00 - we have a docker file and that's where
44:04 - uh things things run so if you see
44:08 - like this is where we get
44:10 - all the wordpress stuff right and they
44:12 - actually have send grid built in if we
44:14 - need to do
44:15 - emails
44:17 - we aren't we aren't going to need the
44:18 - send grid part of this
44:20 - or at least we aren't going to use it
44:22 - i'm not sure yet if we need it
44:25 - uh so that wordpress will still work
44:29 - there are some parts of wordpress that
44:31 - auto send emails you know to
44:34 - like people when they sign in as users
44:36 - or uh to whoever the admin is which
44:38 - would probably be me
44:41 - whenever new users users sign in so we
44:44 - may need the email just for that sort of
44:46 - thing
44:48 - so might keep it but essentially you
44:51 - know for those of you who know docker
44:52 - this will make more sense to you
44:54 - uh but
44:56 - these are all the instructions to get
44:57 - wordpress up and running within that
44:59 - docker container
45:01 - um
45:03 - so i need to spend more time kind of
45:05 - studying this to figure out because
45:07 - there are a few things in use here that
45:09 - i've never used before so harshit
45:11 - mentions uh hhvm i've never even heard
45:14 - of that before much less used it so
45:16 - that's one of the things i want to
45:18 - research more about
45:23 - harshad says it will be two times faster
45:25 - than php5
45:27 - hey well i like that
45:29 - [Music]
45:30 - anything to make it faster is good so
45:35 - so if anybody knows a little bit more
45:37 - about docker and can kind of see what's
45:38 - going on or you want to use the link to
45:41 - um
45:42 - you know to check it out inspect it a
45:44 - little bit more depth you know if you
45:46 - have some some input for me that would
45:48 - be great
45:52 - but this is the official example if you
45:54 - go to the now documentation and you look
45:57 - up
45:58 - wordpress this is where they point you
46:01 - uh so
46:03 - it's um
46:05 - it's at least trusted by the now team to
46:08 - use with wordpress
46:11 - uh so i'm kind of basing my confidence
46:13 - on on that
46:22 - uh michael creel has a good point
46:25 - says not sure how wordpress works when
46:27 - you finally hand it off you're going to
46:28 - need
46:29 - a lot of validation rules
46:32 - uh if they're going to be less
46:33 - experienced people working on it i
46:35 - paraphrased a bit but um
46:38 - yeah
46:39 - yes you're right uh we're def that's why
46:42 - we're holding off
46:44 - on
46:44 - giving other people access right now and
46:46 - we're gonna slowly roll it out and train
46:49 - people over the next year
46:51 - one of the
46:52 - one of the big reasons other than just
46:54 - the time it takes for training is
46:56 - making sure
46:58 - that we set it up in a way that users
47:00 - have as much freedom as possible
47:03 - without really the ability to mess
47:05 - things up
47:07 - too much
47:08 - so
47:09 - we're definitely going to be
47:10 - working on that
47:22 - okay
47:24 - let me go back here
47:27 - and say so basically
47:29 - we have
47:32 - our plans and then backups for
47:34 - everything except this um google cloud
47:37 - sql
47:38 - um and i'm gonna put here as a slash
47:42 - slash aws because you know as we
47:44 - mentioned earlier
47:47 - you know if we decide to go with google
47:49 - here we're gonna go with google you know
47:51 - down here as well
47:53 - if we decide to go with aws it's going
47:56 - to be aws you know pretty much across
47:58 - the board
48:02 - but as a backup let me know what you
48:04 - think about
48:05 - you know essentially
48:07 - doing
48:12 - something like this right
48:17 - load balance situation droplets
48:20 - and
48:22 - actually i let me change this to say
48:24 - load balance situation droplets here
48:27 - okay now
48:28 - if you're not familiar with with how
48:29 - we've done this in the past
48:32 - essentially what you do is have droplets
48:34 - that are exactly the same
48:36 - so let's we run a few droplets that are
48:38 - exactly the same and then we would use
48:40 - digital oceans load balancing service
48:42 - which is an extra 20 a month
48:45 - and then
48:46 - they would handle a lot of the technical
48:48 - details of it we would just have control
48:51 - over a few settings
48:53 - and then they would you know they the
48:54 - load balancing would be handled so for
48:56 - each time we do this for the react app
48:59 - that adds an extra 20
49:01 - for the database extra 20 for wordpress
49:03 - and extra 20.
49:05 - uh so that's an extra 60 a month
49:08 - that
49:09 - potentially we wouldn't really need
49:12 - uh just for the load balancing and then
49:13 - on top of that we need the droplets
49:16 - so we'd have to pay for each one of the
49:18 - droplets so
49:20 - i believe that using now
49:23 - and some sort of cloud service here
49:25 - would end up being
49:28 - easier to manage and also less expensive
49:33 - uh also easier to scale
49:39 - let's see
49:42 - we have a few more opinions on this as
49:44 - well so let's see
49:46 - uh harshit says aws rds is also
49:52 - good easy to set up
49:54 - uh use docker for my sequel with volume
49:57 - but i guess that would be overkill
50:00 - francisca says i have to run thanks for
50:02 - the stream watch we'll catch the rest
50:03 - offline thank you so much for watching
50:05 - and lending your opinion i really
50:06 - appreciate it and again thank you for
50:09 - the the workshop i love the workshop and
50:12 - i learned so much it's going to help me
50:14 - with with my job
50:16 - so
50:17 - again thank you that's uh that's awesome
50:24 - okay all right so at this point
50:27 - i still want to hear your opinions
50:29 - either now on the live chat or
50:33 - um
50:34 - later on in the comments
50:36 - uh if you don't want to say anything
50:37 - publicly you can always dm me on twitter
50:39 - if you want
50:40 - but
50:42 - i'm going to go now and start reading
50:44 - some of the other questions that aren't
50:45 - directly related to
50:47 - deployment
50:49 - i did have a comment from harshit
50:50 - harshit says add aws rds to that list so
50:54 - we're talking about the sql list then
51:02 - anyway i'm sure there's a little delay
51:04 - but our should let me know
51:06 - i couldn't remember what the aws
51:08 - equivalent of cloud sql was
51:17 - uh so let me scroll up a bit
51:20 - so i don't miss any of these questions
51:21 - so scan through them
51:44 - let's see
51:57 - okay chris uh asks if i've done anything
52:00 - with css grid yet
52:02 - i've just done a little bit with css
52:04 - grid so uh it's something that is
52:07 - definitely on my list of things to
52:10 - research more
52:12 - i i would love to know more i've i've
52:14 - actually found some tutorials that i
52:16 - i've like put in my
52:18 - the links to in my google keep like hey
52:21 - i want to do this and then i just
52:22 - haven't really had time to get
52:25 - um
52:28 - to kind of do it
52:30 - so definitely want to learn more about
52:33 - grid because from what i've heard from
52:35 - other developers like that's that's
52:36 - where it's at
52:45 - oh okay so harshit says the aws rds
52:48 - stands for relational database system
52:52 - cool
52:53 - that act that's an aws name that
52:55 - actually makes sense right relational
52:57 - database system definitely makes sense
53:04 - harshit says i will catch up the stream
53:06 - not sure why you need digital droplets
53:09 - on top of those services oh these aren't
53:12 - the digitization droplets this is the
53:14 - these are the backup plans
53:16 - in case for some reason i can't do the
53:19 - primary so on each one of these the
53:21 - first option is what i want to do
53:24 - but if that doesn't work out for some
53:26 - reason the other options are potential
53:29 - backups so i'm not intending on doing
53:32 - all of these things just one in each
53:35 - category
53:36 - i keep
53:37 - i keep moving my mouse on the wrong side
53:39 - this is the side that you're probably
53:41 - looking at
53:54 - joshua says what would you recommend for
53:57 - a geolocation api that could tell if
53:59 - you're standing next to someone i was
54:01 - thinking google places but was looking
54:03 - for some feedback
54:05 - um
54:19 - i'm trying to think uh i've used like
54:21 - google
54:22 - google's geolocation stuff before but
54:24 - it's been a really long time
54:27 - trying to tell whether you're standing
54:29 - next to a person might
54:31 - it might be a little bit difficult to
54:32 - get that accurate like
54:35 - trying to tell if you're within a
54:36 - certain range of a person is definitely
54:38 - doable i i suppose assuming that person
54:42 - also has the location services enabled
54:44 - and you have access to theirs
54:47 - but like
54:48 - let's say if there's like five people
54:50 - that all have that enabled i mean
54:54 - i don't know i guess it could
54:57 - yeah now i think about it i i think
54:59 - that's definitely possible
55:02 - uh with with google's
55:05 - geo location services
55:13 - harshit says
55:15 - you could easily spin up rds cluster
55:17 - that will give user and password added
55:19 - wp config and database done
55:22 - yeah
55:23 - yeah definitely it's uh harsha
55:26 - that's what i'm hoping for
55:28 - uh the only is like i um
55:31 - i'm pretty sure you do the same thing
55:32 - with the cloud sql so i'm kind of like
55:36 - just wondering
55:39 - which one should
55:41 - we go with i also want to talk to
55:45 - the other developer that works in my
55:46 - department to see what he thinks
55:49 - and he handles the accounts like the
55:52 - billing for the accounts so i want to
55:53 - see like
55:54 - in his opinion what would be easier to
55:56 - set up
55:58 - billing wise right now
56:01 - so that may
56:03 - that may be a big factor as well because
56:06 - i don't want to i don't want any trouble
56:08 - in this process of getting all the
56:09 - accounts set up i wanted to go as
56:11 - quickly and smoothly as possible
56:13 - so
56:15 - i like i i think either one of these aws
56:18 - or google will work
56:20 - just kind of not exactly sure which one
56:22 - to go with at this point
56:26 - okay
56:28 - well i've gotten to the end it seems
56:30 - like i've answered all the questions if
56:31 - you have any more questions throw them
56:33 - in here if you get them in in the next
56:34 - minute or so i'll see them and i'll be
56:36 - able to answer
56:37 - um otherwise i think i'll finish up with
56:40 - this stream
56:41 - and uh probably do a little bit more
56:43 - research on this
56:45 - and our our streams coming up over the
56:48 - next week we'll assuming i can get the
56:50 - billing and accounts set up soon
56:52 - our next streams will be
56:55 - basically deploying all this stuff
57:07 - joshua says thanks a bunch yeah no
57:08 - problem
57:14 - uh mad duchess
57:16 - responding to someone else says
57:18 - csstricks.com has awesome tips for all
57:20 - css but also on grid there are a lot of
57:22 - articles about css on that site yeah
57:24 - definitely i've i've
57:27 - definitely used some of the articles on
57:28 - csstricks.com before that's a great
57:30 - resource
57:38 - robocop says nice stream thanks
57:42 - thanks i appreciate that
57:44 - all right well i think i'm gonna finish
57:45 - up now
57:47 - and um
57:48 - yeah if if any of you watching later on
57:51 - or watching right now think of something
57:53 - or some options um or warnings for me
57:56 - for this setup later on please let me
57:58 - know dm me comment whatever you want
58:02 - um but
58:03 - you know definitely would like all the
58:05 - input uh that i can especially for those
58:08 - of you who have actually used these
58:09 - projects before
58:11 - uh can give me some
58:13 - you know kind of good uh input that i
58:15 - may not be able to read anywhere else
58:19 - okay i think that's it
58:21 - uh i'm gonna do my best to try to stream
58:23 - as many days as i can this week
58:26 - and so hopefully i'll be seeing you a
58:29 - lot this week to make up for all the
58:31 - times i didn't stream last week
58:33 - and so in until
58:36 - probably tomorrow's stream
58:38 - uh
58:39 - have a great day
