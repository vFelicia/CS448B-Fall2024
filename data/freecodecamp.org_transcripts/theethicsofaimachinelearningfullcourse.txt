02:14 - its various types in delve into
02:16 - techniques subfields ethics and real
02:19 - world applications we'll examine not
02:22 - just the tech itself but also its
02:24 - implications on society economy and
02:27 - Global development
02:29 - this is not a technical course there's
02:31 - plenty of amazing incredible AI
02:34 - programming content on free code Camp if
02:36 - that's what you're looking for
02:37 - instead we're going to focus on how AI
02:40 - is currently being used how it might be
02:43 - used and how we can ensure that it's
02:45 - employed in a way that benefits Humanity
02:48 - as this course presupposes no prior
02:51 - knowledge of AI or ml we're going to
02:53 - define a bunch of terms and Concepts
02:55 - like Ai and ml
02:57 - if you're already really comfortable
02:59 - with topics like neural networks or
03:01 - natural language processing
03:03 - you can feel free to skip part two the
03:05 - basics of the AI and ml
03:08 - so what are you going to get out of this
03:11 - video
03:11 - our journey is more than just talking
03:14 - about technology it's a holistic broader
03:16 - view by the end of our time together
03:18 - you'll have a groundnut in the basics of
03:21 - AI from the algorithms that power it to
03:23 - the applications that make it so
03:25 - revolutionary
03:27 - we won't stop at just understanding the
03:29 - mechanics it's about ethics values in
03:32 - the real world implications that make AI
03:34 - not only a scientific Marvel but a
03:36 - philosophical moral and societal
03:39 - challenge
03:40 - hi everyone my name is okazley Bell and
03:43 - I'm a student at Stanford and the
03:44 - founder of fitter Tom one of the world's
03:46 - largest Civil Society groups working on
03:48 - the many limbs of building and
03:50 - regulating responsible technology
03:52 - especially AI I'll be speaking on a
03:55 - couple of topics in this course with
03:56 - arguably the most important question to
03:58 - start off with what is AI
04:01 - a common misconception is that the term
04:03 - AI is typically confined to high
04:06 - functioning systems like chat GPT for
04:08 - example but in reality it can be as
04:11 - simple as a pre-programmed chat bot as
04:13 - complex as Google or tick tock's content
04:15 - recommendation algorithms or as
04:17 - consequential as disease or Grime risk
04:20 - prediction systems while the connotation
04:22 - of AI varies across Academia and
04:25 - Industry it typically refers to systems
04:27 - that use math to provide Automotive
04:29 - generative or predictive outputs or
04:31 - functions so AI at its highest level is
04:34 - about crafting algorithms that allow
04:36 - machines to perform tasks typically
04:38 - requiring human intelligence this
04:40 - includes learning from data reasoning
04:42 - logically solving problems perceiving
04:44 - the environment and even understanding
04:46 - human languages ai's applications are
04:49 - not confined to a single domain they
04:52 - stretch across various Fields both in
04:54 - general spheres and within the nuanced
04:56 - Arena of International Development
04:59 - ai's ability to analyze massive data
05:03 - sets enables more informed decisions in
05:06 - government policy but also in very
05:08 - different spaces such as finance and
05:10 - climate attack
05:11 - it's transforming Health Care as well
05:13 - ranging from enhancing diagnosis to
05:16 - personalizing treatment especially
05:18 - providing vital support in
05:19 - under-resourced areas
05:21 - artificial intelligence is reshaping the
05:23 - educational landscape through
05:25 - personalized learning adaptive content
05:27 - and making e-learning accessible even in
05:29 - remote regions and its influence on
05:32 - recruiting and employment follows a
05:34 - similar Trend redefining practices
05:36 - through tailored Solutions and
05:37 - technological innovation
05:40 - even agriculture is witnessing an AI
05:42 - driven Revolution were optimizing
05:45 - farming techniques for higher yields and
05:47 - supporting small-scale Farmers with AI
05:50 - driven insights are just the beginning
05:52 - of what's possible
05:55 - in the second half of this course we'll
05:57 - delve deeper into some of these areas
06:00 - while this course offers a comprehensive
06:02 - overview I have consciously chosen to
06:05 - keep it open to all ages apolitical and
06:09 - non-us Centric
06:10 - so some applications of AI such as those
06:13 - in elections and voting or the creation
06:16 - of adult content won't be discussed in
06:18 - detail if you find these topics
06:20 - intriguing links to resources for
06:23 - further exploration will be provided in
06:24 - the description of this video
06:28 - so
06:29 - the big question
06:31 - why should you care
06:33 - why watch the rest of this video course
06:36 - to start
06:37 - unethical AI practices have the
06:40 - potential to result in widespread
06:42 - discrimination
06:44 - AI systems are only as unbiased as the
06:47 - data that they are trained on if these
06:49 - systems are trained on unrepresented
06:51 - data they can unintentionally perpetuate
06:54 - and amplify existing societal biases
06:58 - this can lead to discriminatory outcomes
07:01 - in vital areas such as employment
07:03 - lending and many more potentially
07:07 - disadvantageous to certain groups based
07:09 - on factors like race gender or
07:12 - socioeconomic status
07:16 - trying to solve a problem or end a
07:19 - pattern of human-driven discrimination
07:21 - using artificial intelligence often
07:24 - backfires because algorithms are
07:27 - designed to imitate human behavior not
07:30 - deviate from it
07:33 - alignment in the context of AI refers to
07:36 - the Endeavor to ensure that AI system
07:38 - objectives actions and outcomes are in
07:42 - harmony with human values and goals
07:45 - misaligned AI systems pose a significant
07:48 - risk because their objectives may not
07:50 - coincide with ours leading to unintended
07:53 - and potentially harmful outcomes
07:56 - consider for instance a hypothetical
07:58 - super intelligent AI whose primary
08:01 - objective is to optimize paperclip
08:04 - production
08:05 - if not properly aligned such an
08:08 - artificial intelligence could consume
08:09 - all available resources including vital
08:12 - ones necessary for human survival to
08:14 - achieve its goal of Maximum paper clip
08:16 - production effectively leading to a
08:19 - catastrophic scenario for Humanity
08:21 - this extreme example
08:23 - often referred to as the paperclip
08:26 - maximizer thought experiment underlines
08:28 - the potential severity of AI
08:30 - misalignment
08:33 - what that means is that it is incumbent
08:35 - upon us to ensure the development of AI
08:38 - systems aligns with human values and
08:42 - interests and rigorous ethical scrutiny
08:44 - is applied to prevent any worst case
08:46 - scenario from becoming a reality
08:50 - if developed and deployed ethically AI
08:54 - systems can serve as powerful tools for
08:56 - societal good
08:58 - they can promote fairness by making
09:00 - unbiased decisions
09:02 - they can enhance commercial
09:03 - accountability by ensuring transparency
09:06 - and Foster inclusivity by providing
09:09 - personalized solutions to diverse
09:11 - populations
09:13 - from assisting doctors in diagnosing
09:15 - diseases to helping Educators provide
09:18 - personalized learning experiences
09:20 - ethical AI has the potential
09:23 - to improve countless lives and create a
09:26 - more Equitable Society
09:30 - and yet the importance of AI ethics
09:33 - extends Beyond immediate outcomes AI is
09:36 - poised to be a defining technology of
09:38 - our future with the potential to reshape
09:40 - our social fabric economy and Global
09:44 - Order
09:45 - as developers users policy makers and
09:48 - most importantly as humans we are all
09:51 - stakeholders in this future and so it's
09:54 - our shared responsibility to ensure that
09:56 - AI Technologies are developed and used
09:58 - in ways that align with our ethical
10:00 - values and mitigate harm
10:03 - understanding AI ethics is not just
10:05 - about preventing negative outcomes but
10:07 - rather actively working towards a future
10:09 - where AI serves as a tool for human
10:12 - flourishing
10:14 - so the study of AI ethics encouraged us
10:16 - to not just ask what can we do with AI
10:20 - but what should we do
10:22 - it pushes us to consider how we can
10:24 - harness ai's immense potential
10:26 - responsibly
10:27 - in a way that respects our shared human
10:29 - values promotes those Equitable outcomes
10:31 - and contributes to a better future for
10:35 - all of us
10:36 - AI ethics therefore is not just
10:38 - important
10:39 - it's essential
10:42 - are you excited yet we're just getting
10:44 - started next we're going to explore the
10:46 - basics of AI and ml
10:54 - now we are going beyond the surface to
10:58 - explore AI types and techniques
11:00 - including machine learning or ml in
11:03 - particular
11:04 - we'll demystify how algorithms can learn
11:06 - from data explore the architecture
11:09 - behind neural networks and look at how
11:12 - different algorithms serve different
11:13 - purposes
11:15 - in the world of artificial intelligence
11:17 - we commonly speak of three main types of
11:20 - AI
11:21 - the first is narrow or weak AI such as
11:24 - Siri or Alexa designed to perform
11:27 - specific tasks though quite skilled in
11:30 - their specific areas these systems can't
11:32 - go beyond their defined scope
11:35 - moving up the ladder we find General AI
11:38 - or strong AI
11:40 - a theoretical concept of machines with
11:43 - the ability to perform any intellectual
11:45 - task that a human can
11:47 - it's an ambitious goal that we are still
11:49 - striving to achieve although recent
11:51 - models such as Google scata are getting
11:53 - closer
11:55 - finally there's the concept of super
11:58 - intelligent AI which would surpass human
12:01 - intelligence entirely
12:03 - having the ability to learn and
12:06 - understand any task
12:08 - it's a thrilling and futuristic idea but
12:10 - it also brings up deep ethical and
12:12 - philosophical questions
12:14 - most AI researchers believe we're still
12:16 - a ways away from anything resembling
12:18 - super intelligent AI
12:20 - but as we'll discuss more later once you
12:22 - hit that point things begin moving
12:24 - pretty quickly
12:26 - together we'll explore each of these
12:28 - types of AI in Greater detail throughout
12:30 - the rest of this video
12:32 - in the realm of artificial intelligence
12:35 - several techniques enable machines to
12:37 - emulate human-like intelligence
12:41 - first we have machine learning or ml
12:45 - which is a core technique allowing
12:47 - systems to learn from experience and
12:50 - improve over time
12:51 - unlike traditional programming where
12:54 - instructions are explicitly given ml
12:57 - enables systems to adapt and evolve by
13:00 - themselves
13:01 - as you can see in the diagram the core
13:04 - differences in the inputs and the
13:06 - outputs with the normal program you
13:09 - write the program and give it input and
13:11 - it runs to create the output
13:13 - with ML you give a model input and what
13:17 - you want the output to look like and
13:19 - then it figures out what the program
13:20 - should look like to obtain that
13:23 - here's some examples
13:25 - email filtering
13:27 - machine learning algorithms analyze
13:29 - thousands of emails learning the common
13:31 - characteristics of spam such as certain
13:34 - phrases patterns or sender profiles the
13:38 - model iteratively refines its
13:40 - understanding becoming a virtual expert
13:41 - in spam detection
13:44 - so you know that's why Gmail is so good
13:47 - movie recommendations services like
13:50 - Netflix use ml to analyze your viewing
13:53 - history ratings and behavior to predict
13:55 - what you might like to watch next
13:57 - the model considers various factors like
14:00 - genres directors actors and even the
14:03 - time you usually watch to offer
14:05 - personalized recommendations the more
14:08 - you interact the more tailored those
14:10 - recommendations become
14:13 - these examples showcase the adaptability
14:15 - of machine learning
14:17 - learning from patterns and providing
14:19 - actionable insights or automation
14:22 - as technology evolves we can expect to
14:25 - see even more applications that Leverage
14:27 - The predictive power of machine learning
14:31 - next there's deep learning an advanced
14:34 - approach inspired by the human brain's
14:36 - complex neural networks
14:39 - unlike traditional machine learning
14:41 - which can work with simpler algorithms
14:43 - deep learning involves multiple layers
14:45 - of interconnected nodes that process
14:48 - information in a hierarchical manner
14:51 - this allows deep learning models to
14:53 - automatically extract features and
14:55 - handle more complex tasks
14:58 - deep learning has paved the way for
15:00 - advancements in areas like facial
15:02 - recognition and natural language
15:04 - processing
15:06 - there's some examples of deep learning
15:08 - facial recognition
15:10 - deep learning algorithms particularly
15:12 - convolutional neural networks or cnns
15:16 - which we'll talk more about later have
15:17 - revolutionized facial recognition
15:19 - technology by analyzing thousands of
15:22 - facial features and patterns these
15:24 - models can identify and verify
15:26 - individuals with high accuracy
15:29 - another popular one to talk about
15:31 - autonomous driving deep learning plays a
15:34 - crucial role in enabling self-driving
15:36 - cars to navigate and make decisions by
15:39 - processing vast amounts of data from
15:41 - cameras sensors and radar deep neural
15:45 - networks can recognize objects
15:46 - pedestrians and other vehicles can
15:48 - understand traffic signs and make
15:50 - real-time driving decisions
15:53 - finally
15:55 - we have natural language process anger
15:57 - NLP
15:59 - which serves as a bridge between human
16:01 - communication and machine understanding
16:04 - while traditional machine learning may
16:06 - require manual feature extraction for
16:08 - text Data NLP uses both statistical and
16:11 - deep learning techniques to
16:12 - automatically interpret respond to and
16:15 - even generate human languages
16:18 - this enables a more nuanced
16:19 - understanding of language including
16:22 - syntax semantics and context
16:25 - as we continue we'll delve into specific
16:28 - examples in each of these techniques to
16:31 - provide a concrete understanding of how
16:34 - they function and their significant
16:37 - roles in our technology driven world
16:40 - two examples of natural language
16:42 - processing would be chat Bots or virtual
16:45 - assistants
16:46 - natural language processing enables chat
16:48 - Bots and assistance like Siri or Alexa
16:51 - to understand and respond to human
16:54 - language by analyzing syntax semantics
16:57 - and contacts these systems can engage in
16:58 - conversation answer questions and
17:01 - perform tasks based on Voice or text
17:03 - commands
17:05 - sentiment analysis is another one
17:07 - businesses often use natural language
17:09 - processing to analyze customer feedback
17:11 - reviews and social media comments to
17:14 - gauge public sentiment about products or
17:17 - services
17:18 - by understanding the nuances of language
17:20 - including tone and emotion and sarcasm
17:22 - natural language processing algorithms
17:25 - can provide insights into customer
17:26 - satisfaction and preferences
17:30 - within the diverse and expansive realm
17:32 - of AI there are also many even more
17:35 - specialized sub-areas each contributing
17:37 - uniquely to that field
17:40 - generative AI is one such area that has
17:43 - recently captured the imagination of
17:45 - millions of people
17:47 - from the conversational prowess of
17:49 - Chachi PT to the mathematical assistance
17:52 - of photomath NLP is enabling machines to
17:55 - understand
17:56 - interpret and generate human languages
18:00 - the subfield enhances the way that we
18:02 - interact with technology
18:04 - making it more intuitive responsive and
18:06 - human-like
18:08 - computer vision is another fascinating
18:11 - subfield dedicated to teaching computers
18:13 - to perceive and interpret the visual
18:15 - world
18:16 - it's the driving force behind Crown
18:18 - baking Innovations like self-dropping
18:21 - cars and facial recognition systems
18:24 - another field near and dear to my heart
18:26 - is robotics a field that merges AI with
18:29 - mechanical design
18:31 - revolutionizing industries from
18:33 - Healthcare to Manufacturing
18:36 - neural networks inspired by our brains
18:39 - architecture are at the center of many
18:42 - AI applications
18:43 - on a simplistic high level a neural
18:46 - network is like a virtual brain that
18:48 - helps computers learn from data
18:51 - imagine you're teaching it to recognize
18:53 - a cat you show it many pictures some of
18:56 - cats and some of other things
18:59 - the network makes guesses and you
19:01 - correct it the brain has layers of
19:04 - neurons that work together the first
19:07 - layer looks at basic things like lines
19:09 - and colors the next layers combine these
19:12 - Basics to recognize shapes like ears and
19:14 - Tails and the final layer puts it all
19:17 - together to say this is a cut
19:19 - over time with more pictures and
19:22 - Corrections the network gets better at
19:24 - recognizing cats it's like learning to
19:26 - ride a bike you get better with practice
19:28 - now for a more technical breakdown
19:31 - neural networks consist of
19:33 - interconnected layers of nodes or
19:35 - neurons each neuron receives an input
19:38 - processes it using a mathematical
19:40 - function and passes the output to the
19:43 - next layer
19:44 - here's what that looks like
19:46 - first the Network's input layer receives
19:49 - the raw data such as pixel values of an
19:52 - image
19:53 - each neuron corresponds to one feature
19:56 - like a pixels color intensity then there
19:59 - are hidden layers which contain neurons
20:00 - that perform computations
20:03 - each neuron's input is a weighted sum of
20:07 - the previous layer's outputs plus a bias
20:10 - term the weights and biases are the
20:12 - parameters that the network learns
20:14 - through training the weighted sum is
20:16 - then passed through an activation
20:18 - function like sigmoid
20:20 - this introduces non-linearity allowing
20:24 - the network to learn complex patterns
20:26 - finally the output layer produces the
20:29 - final prediction
20:30 - for classification tasks a softmax
20:32 - function might be used to convert the
20:35 - final layer's outputs into probabilities
20:39 - networks are trained using a data set by
20:42 - repeatedly making predictions and
20:43 - comparing them to the true labels the
20:46 - differences between the predictions and
20:48 - the True Values are measured using a
20:51 - loss function
20:52 - the weights and biases are then updated
20:55 - using an optimization algorithm like
20:57 - gradient descent
20:59 - this process iteratively adjusts the
21:01 - parameters to minimize the loss in
21:03 - proving the Network's predictions
21:06 - the key to understanding the training of
21:08 - neural networks is an algorithm called
21:10 - back propagation it calculates the
21:13 - gradients of the loss function with
21:14 - respect to each weight and bias by
21:17 - applying the chain rule remember that
21:19 - from calculus
21:20 - these gradients are used to update the
21:23 - parameters in the direction that reduces
21:25 - the loss
21:28 - in other words a neural network learns
21:31 - to make predictions by adjusting its
21:33 - internal parameters based on the
21:35 - feedback it receives it's a highly
21:37 - iterative and computational process that
21:40 - enables a network to learn complex
21:42 - mappings from inputs to outputs
21:46 - okay cool but what can you actually do
21:49 - with them
21:50 - burst handwriting
21:52 - systems like those used by postal
21:54 - services to read addresses utilize
21:56 - neural networks to translate complex
21:58 - handwriting into standardized text they
22:01 - analyze individual Strokes curves and
22:04 - spacing learning to recognize various
22:06 - handwriting styles
22:08 - another one voice command recognition
22:11 - smart devices like Siri use neural
22:14 - networks to understand that spoken
22:16 - language
22:17 - these networks analyze the sound waves
22:19 - breaking them down into components that
22:21 - represent different aspects of speech
22:23 - like tone pitch and accent
22:28 - and yet another one fraud detection
22:30 - networks analyze spending patterns
22:32 - geographical locations in time to detect
22:36 - suspicious activity if an unexpected
22:38 - pattern emerges it might flag a
22:40 - transaction for review
22:43 - now let's look at a few different kinds
22:45 - of Networks
22:48 - recurrent neural networks or rnns are
22:51 - designed for sequential data making them
22:54 - suitable for applications like weather
22:56 - forecasting and real-time language
22:58 - translation
23:00 - unlike traditional neural networks rnns
23:03 - have connections that loop back on
23:05 - themselves allowing information to
23:07 - persist this looping mechanism enables
23:11 - them to remember previous inputs in the
23:13 - sequence thereby understanding the
23:16 - context and making informed predictions
23:18 - about future data
23:20 - for example in language translation rnns
23:24 - can learn the syntax grammar and context
23:26 - of a sentence providing more accurate
23:29 - translations
23:31 - convolutional neural networks or cnns
23:33 - are tailored for visual tasks and are
23:37 - widely used in medical Diagnostics and
23:39 - autonomous vehicles
23:41 - cnns utilize convolutional layers that
23:44 - apply filters to the input data
23:46 - detecting local patterns such as edges
23:49 - and textures
23:50 - these detected features are then pooled
23:53 - and passed through fully connected
23:55 - layers to make final predictions
23:57 - and medical Diagnostics cnns can detect
24:00 - tumors and x-rays or MRI scans by
24:03 - recognizing subtle patterns that might
24:04 - be missed by human eyes
24:07 - and autonomous vehicles they interpret
24:09 - the visual World allowing the car to
24:11 - navigate its environment
24:14 - generative adversarial networks organs
24:17 - consist of two competing networks a
24:20 - generator and a discriminator
24:22 - the generator creates content such as
24:25 - images while the discriminator evaluates
24:28 - the generated content against Real data
24:31 - they are trained together in a cat and
24:33 - mouse game where the generator tries to
24:35 - produce realistic content and the
24:37 - discriminator tries to distinguish
24:39 - between the real content and the
24:40 - generated content in the world of art
24:42 - Gans have created entirely New pieces by
24:45 - learning from historical art styles
24:48 - in gaming they generate realistic
24:50 - Landscapes and characters
24:53 - Transformers such as the generative
24:55 - pre-trained Transformer or GPT models
24:58 - are significant advancement in neural
25:00 - networks particularly for NLP
25:03 - unlike rnns Transformers use attention
25:06 - mechanisms that weigh the importance of
25:09 - different parts of the input allowing
25:12 - them to capture long-range dependencies
25:14 - in data
25:15 - this enables them to understand the
25:17 - context of words in a sentence even if
25:20 - they are far apart
25:23 - GPT models have been employed in various
25:26 - applications from writing assistance to
25:28 - complex question answering systems
25:31 - showcasing the power of neural networks
25:33 - and understanding and emulating human
25:37 - language
25:38 - there are dozens of other networks
25:41 - including many other extremely popular
25:43 - ones but the networks we've discussed
25:46 - adequately showcase the breadth of ai's
25:49 - capabilities from creative Endeavors to
25:51 - life-saving Medical applications data
25:54 - sets are the lifeblood of machine
25:56 - learning providing the raw material for
25:59 - that learning
26:00 - let's explore two different types
26:02 - let's start with images for facial
26:05 - recognition a data set might include
26:06 - thousands of faces each tag with an
26:09 - identity the system learns to identify
26:11 - unique visual features and expressions
26:15 - another example would be sentiment
26:16 - analysis where text models like product
26:20 - reviews or social media posts are
26:23 - analyzed to gauge public sentiment these
26:26 - data sets can help in understanding the
26:27 - nuances of human language and emotion
26:31 - the quality and integrity of a data set
26:33 - are really important biased or
26:36 - unbalanced data can lead to flawed
26:38 - models raising critical ethical
26:40 - considerations which we'll discuss way
26:42 - more later
26:43 - as one example tick this image of a data
26:47 - set of puppies and chicken tenders the
26:50 - meme illustrates how challenging it can
26:52 - be for an AI model such as a
26:54 - convolutional neural network to
26:56 - differentiate between objects that have
26:58 - similar visual characteristics
27:01 - while humans can usually tell the
27:03 - difference based on context and
27:05 - experience AI models might struggle
27:08 - it also underscores the importance of
27:11 - diverse and representative training data
27:13 - if a model has not been exposed to
27:15 - enough variations of puppies and chicken
27:18 - tenders it may not have learned the
27:21 - subtle features that distinguish them
27:23 - it also points to the complexity of
27:25 - future extraction in image recognition
27:29 - identifying the essential
27:30 - characteristics that differentiate a
27:32 - puppy from a chicken tender is a
27:34 - non-trivial task
27:38 - sometimes the process of learning
27:40 - features can be problematic especially
27:42 - with deep learning algorithms since
27:44 - these systems determine and distinguish
27:46 - features independently without any
27:48 - explicit programming they sometimes
27:50 - discover incorrect yet true patterns in
27:52 - data let me give you an example a neural
27:55 - network trained to identify malignant
27:57 - skin lesions observed that many medical
28:00 - images of cancerous lesions included a
28:02 - ruler for scale instead of learning the
28:05 - nuanced differences between benign and
28:07 - malignant lesions in terms of their
28:09 - medical features it trained itself to
28:11 - look for the presence of a ruler given
28:13 - the trends in the training images so it
28:16 - mistakenly learned to associate the
28:17 - presence of a ruler in an image with the
28:19 - likelihood of the lesion being malignant
28:21 - as a result the AI performed super well
28:24 - in the training data but when presented
28:26 - with real world tumor images that didn't
28:28 - adhere to this ruler coincidence as you
28:30 - could expect it failed miserably
28:34 - not only is having broad training data
28:37 - important to building safe and effective
28:39 - AI but so is being able to track its
28:41 - decision-making processes doing so
28:44 - enables the AI to learn General more
28:46 - accurate features and also helps
28:48 - developers explain and fix pain points
28:50 - or causes of error
28:53 - AI is groundbreaking but not without its
28:56 - limitations there are several challenges
28:58 - that we've yet to overcome for large
29:00 - language models to reach their full
29:02 - potential
29:04 - speed is one of those gigantic models
29:08 - powerful but they're also slow faster
29:10 - response times will be necessary as we
29:13 - aim to apply these Technologies in more
29:15 - production settings
29:17 - another one would be bias large language
29:20 - models are trained on data from the
29:22 - internet unfortunately that includes a
29:24 - lot of content warped by our human
29:26 - subjectivity leading to lom's returning
29:29 - results that reflect a lack of diversity
29:31 - as well as being capable of generating
29:33 - extremist content
29:34 - even software developers with the best
29:37 - intentions will unconsciously make
29:39 - choices that cause AI to portray similar
29:42 - World Views
29:44 - outside of large language models one of
29:46 - the most eye-opening studies that
29:48 - brought this issue to the Forefront was
29:50 - conducted by propublica a non-profit
29:53 - investigative journalism organization
29:56 - they looked into an algorithm used in
29:58 - the U.S criminal justice system to
30:01 - predict which individuals are likely to
30:03 - commit crimes again a concept known as
30:06 - recidivism
30:07 - the pro-publica study revealed that this
30:10 - recidivism predicting algorithm
30:13 - had a troubling bias against African
30:16 - Americans in simple terms the algorithm
30:19 - was more likely to wrongly predict that
30:21 - African-American individuals would
30:23 - commit future crimes compared to White
30:26 - individuals on the flip side it was also
30:29 - more likely to incorrectly assume that
30:31 - white individuals were at low risk of
30:32 - reoffending these inaccuracies are not
30:35 - just numbers they have real world
30:38 - consequences such as unfavorably
30:40 - extended prison sentences or denied
30:42 - opportunities for parole this study
30:45 - serves as a wake-up call about the
30:46 - ethical challenges in AI
30:48 - it emphasizes the need for fairness
30:51 - transparency and accountability when we
30:55 - use algorithms to make important
30:56 - decisions especially in sensitive areas
30:59 - like criminal justice
31:01 - the findings from propublica have
31:03 - ignited debates and calls for Action to
31:06 - rigorously evaluate an audit AI
31:08 - algorithms ensuring they don't
31:10 - perpetuate existing societal biases it's
31:14 - a stark reminder that as we move forward
31:16 - with technological advancements we must
31:18 - also be vigilant in safeguarding ethical
31:21 - standards
31:22 - another limitation is hallucinations
31:25 - when given a prompt it doesn't
31:27 - understand generative AI will often
31:29 - respond absurdively with content that is
31:32 - certified bull shark
31:33 - importantly it's difficult to check the
31:35 - validity of such text it's a critical
31:38 - issue for large language models that
31:39 - makes it very difficult to use them for
31:41 - fact checking and essay writing
31:44 - another one plagiarism because the most
31:47 - notable loms are trained on billions of
31:49 - parameters they have plenty of examples
31:51 - to draw from
31:52 - while many of the generated responses
31:54 - are legitimately original there are also
31:57 - some that can be found verbatim on the
31:59 - web
32:00 - this makes large language models
32:01 - problematic when used in academic
32:03 - settings we must construct improved
32:06 - mechanisms for detecting and handling
32:08 - and plagiarism
32:11 - undesirable content is a huge limitation
32:14 - for most of the web's history the
32:16 - majority of content has been limited to
32:18 - what a human could author large language
32:20 - models remove that restriction
32:24 - disinformation is the deliberate
32:26 - spreading of false or misleading
32:28 - information often with the intent to
32:29 - deceive or manipulate public opinion the
32:32 - capabilities of llms to generate text
32:35 - that is indistinguishable from that
32:37 - written by humans have made them a
32:39 - powerful tool for propagating
32:40 - disinformation
32:41 - for example these models can be used to
32:44 - create fake news articles sometimes
32:46 - called read fakes false narratives or
32:49 - misleading social media posts at a scale
32:51 - and speed that were previously
32:52 - unimaginable the danger here is not just
32:55 - the volume of false information but also
32:57 - its potential to be a highly targeted
32:59 - and convincing thereby sowing Discord
33:02 - undermining trusts and institutions and
33:04 - even influencing things as important as
33:07 - elections
33:09 - we're entering an era in which our
33:11 - enemies can make it look like anyone is
33:13 - saying anything at any point in time
33:14 - even if they would never say those
33:16 - things
33:17 - so
33:19 - for instance they could have me say
33:21 - things like
33:22 - I don't know
33:24 - killmonger was right
33:26 - deep fix take disinformation to another
33:29 - level by using deep learning algorithms
33:33 - to create hyper-realistic videos where
33:36 - people appear to say or do things that
33:39 - they never actually did
33:40 - these manipulated videos can be
33:42 - incredibly convincing making it
33:45 - difficult for the average viewer to
33:46 - distinguish between what is real and
33:48 - what is fabricated
33:50 - deep fakes have been used for various
33:52 - malicious purposes from character
33:54 - assassination and fake news
33:57 - dissemination to fraud and blackmail
34:00 - the technology poses a significant
34:02 - threat to personal privacy and public
34:04 - trust as it can be used to create
34:06 - entirely false narratives that are
34:08 - almost impossible to debunk in a timely
34:11 - manner
34:14 - both disinformation and deep fix
34:16 - represent a dark side of artificial
34:18 - intelligence and machine learning
34:19 - Technologies they underscore the urgent
34:22 - need for ethical guidelines robust
34:24 - verification tools and public awareness
34:27 - to combat these emerging threats
34:30 - as these Technologies continue to evolve
34:33 - the challenge will be to balance the
34:34 - incredible potential for Innovation and
34:36 - positive impact against the risks of
34:39 - misuse and harm
34:42 - s you need a centerpiece 20 reps the
34:45 - table called from ebony cut that over
34:48 - into skinny pieces let you clean it with
34:50 - a face
34:51 - you talking money need a hearing aid you
34:55 - talking about me I don't see a shade
34:57 - switch on my side like to get any Lane I
35:00 - switch in my car if I keep anything
35:02 - [Music]
35:06 - when someone uses AI to write an article
35:09 - or create a painting or sing a song who
35:13 - does it belong to
35:14 - can the person who generated at claim
35:16 - ownership
35:17 - there's a lot of new legal questions
35:19 - that have yet to be answered by our
35:21 - aging laws
35:23 - for example if I train a model on your
35:25 - paintings and then it makes more that
35:27 - look similar do I need to compensate you
35:29 - for that
35:30 - or if I use samples of Taylor Swift's
35:33 - music to generate more pop or country do
35:36 - I owe her a songwriting credit
35:39 - my current View
35:41 - shared by an awesome Professor who
35:43 - specializes in copyright
35:44 - is that as of now ai generated images
35:47 - will be considered derivative works of
35:49 - whatever they were trained on
35:52 - another limitation or thing to think
35:54 - about is alignment our large language
35:56 - models aligned with human values and
35:58 - following human intent we'll need to
36:00 - continue training AI systems using human
36:02 - feedback to ensure that the systems
36:04 - we're building bring about more positive
36:06 - than negative consequences I'm going to
36:08 - discuss alignment further in a bit
36:11 - the Black Box problem refers to the
36:14 - challenge of understanding complex ml
36:16 - models imagine a model predicting credit
36:18 - worthiness where the input is the
36:20 - applicant's financial history and
36:22 - employment status and the output is a
36:25 - recommendation to approve or deny the
36:28 - loan
36:28 - do you see the black box
36:32 - the mathematical computations between
36:34 - input and output are hidden often
36:38 - involving hundreds of variables and
36:40 - non-linear transformations
36:42 - this opacity can create ethical and
36:45 - practical challenges
36:47 - in healthcare if a model predicts a
36:50 - disease doctors need to know why to
36:52 - provide proper care
36:54 - in legal settings transparency is
36:56 - usually required for fairness
37:00 - the Black Box problem represents the two
37:03 - core issues that AI systems have if you
37:06 - take only a few things away from this
37:08 - course let this be one of them
37:11 - we do not understand why AI makes the
37:14 - decisions that it does and once AI makes
37:17 - a decision we do not know if that
37:19 - decision was the best one
37:22 - the issue is it's a feedback loop we're
37:25 - not going to talk about predictive
37:26 - policing much in this course but one
37:27 - relevant application is when a police
37:30 - department might use AI to determine
37:32 - where to send their patrol cars
37:34 - an AI model might determine that there
37:36 - are hot spots in three neighborhoods
37:39 - so the cops are sent to those three
37:41 - places they find crime they report back
37:44 - there was crime success right
37:46 - except
37:48 - they didn't go to the other places so
37:50 - they won't know whether or not they
37:51 - would have found crime going elsewhere
37:54 - AI is always right if you don't ever
37:56 - check if it's wrong
38:00 - see why it's difficult to verify results
38:02 - here's another example
38:05 - a school system might use AI to
38:07 - determine which teachers to hire or fire
38:10 - let's say it decides to fire one teacher
38:12 - since the algorithm is a black box the
38:15 - teacher can't appeal to the system
38:17 - and because the teacher was fired we'll
38:19 - never know if their students would have
38:21 - performed better than next year
38:23 - there may have been confounding
38:25 - variables the AI didn't consider
38:28 - we've discussed at length how AI works
38:31 - and now with the black box problem we're
38:34 - starting to explore the ethical
38:35 - implications bit
38:37 - but first let's actually go over some
38:40 - ethical and decision Frameworks that we
38:42 - can then apply to artificial
38:43 - intelligence
38:51 - ethical Frameworks serve as guiding
38:53 - compasses in the complex landscape of
38:56 - morality and ethics they're not just
38:59 - theoretical constructs but deeply
39:01 - ingrained in our culture legal systems
39:04 - and individual beliefs
39:07 - these Frameworks help us navigate moral
39:09 - dilemmas providing tools to identify
39:12 - analyze and resolve ethical issues
39:15 - in the context of AI they become
39:18 - instrumental in guiding design
39:19 - development and deployment ensuring that
39:23 - technology aligns with our societal
39:25 - values and principles
39:31 - consequentialism focuses on the outcomes
39:34 - or Consequences of actions assessing
39:37 - them as right or wrong based on their
39:40 - effect a common form utilitarianism
39:43 - argues for maximizing happiness or
39:45 - welfare across Society
39:47 - in the AI context a consequentialist
39:50 - approach might prioritize systems that
39:52 - optimize efficiency accessibility or
39:55 - overall societal well-being even if that
39:58 - means compromising on individual privacy
40:00 - or autonomy
40:02 - think of algorithms that predict health
40:04 - risks they might save lives but raise
40:07 - questions about personal data usage
40:12 - the trolley problem is a thought
40:14 - experiment highlighting these moral
40:16 - dilemmas imagine a runaway trolley you
40:19 - control the switch that can divert it
40:21 - onto one of two tracks one has five
40:24 - people the other has one what do you do
40:27 - this problem becomes more intricate in
40:30 - AI like in self-driving cars if an
40:32 - accident is imminent how should the car
40:34 - react save the passengers or the
40:37 - pedestrians different ethical Frameworks
40:39 - may lead to different decisions the
40:42 - trolley problem exemplifies the real
40:44 - world ethical challenges that AI
40:46 - developers face
40:49 - deontological ethics yay Kant focuses on
40:53 - the intrinsic morality of actions not
40:55 - their results a deontological
40:57 - perspective might view lying is always
41:00 - wrong even if it leads to a good outcome
41:02 - in AI this approach could manifest in
41:05 - absolute rules around data privacy or
41:08 - non-discrimination
41:10 - for example
41:12 - an algorithm must never use race as a
41:15 - factor in a decision even if
41:17 - statistically it could improve accuracy
41:20 - this rigid rule-based approach has
41:22 - strengths and creating clear guidelines
41:24 - but might lack flexibility in
41:27 - more complex real-world scenarios
41:31 - virtue ethics emphasizes character
41:34 - traits and virtues that lead to good
41:36 - moral Behavior
41:37 - it's about becoming a good person not
41:40 - just following rules or achieving good
41:42 - outcomes in AI this could translate into
41:45 - Building Systems that encourage positive
41:47 - human values like empathy creativity or
41:52 - collaboration
41:53 - imagine a virtual tutor that not only
41:56 - teaches mathematics but also encourages
41:58 - curiosity and resilience in students
42:02 - virtue ethics brings a human-centered
42:04 - approach aligning technology with our
42:07 - aspirations with personal growth and
42:09 - societal Harmony
42:11 - contract based ethics use morality as a
42:14 - set of rules or agreements made by
42:17 - rational individuals in political
42:20 - philosophy social contract theory has
42:22 - been influential
42:24 - in AI this might translate into
42:26 - transparent agreements between AI
42:28 - providers and users about data handling
42:30 - algorithmic bias or accountability
42:33 - the recent calls for regulation and
42:36 - standardization and AI can be seen as
42:39 - attempts to formalize these contracts
42:42 - ensuring that the technology serves the
42:45 - public interest while respecting
42:47 - individual rights
42:50 - applying these ethical Frameworks to AI
42:52 - is a multi-faceted task involving
42:55 - developers regulators and users by using
42:58 - consequentialist ethics we might
43:00 - evaluate an AI system's deployment based
43:03 - on the happiness or efficiency it
43:05 - generates
43:06 - deontological principles might demand
43:08 - strict adherence to privacy Norms virtue
43:11 - ethics could push us to create
43:13 - technology that uplifts human dignity
43:15 - and contract-based ethics could seek to
43:17 - formalize relationships between
43:19 - different stakeholders
43:22 - the ethical design of AI is not just
43:25 - about avoiding harm but about crafting
43:27 - technology that embodies our highest
43:30 - values and aspirations
43:32 - as we discussed briefly before AI
43:35 - alignment represents the critical
43:37 - challenge of ensuring that AI systems
43:39 - understand and align with human values
43:42 - and intentions it's a multi-faceted
43:44 - issue with various methods to address
43:46 - each catering to different contacts and
43:49 - ethical considerations
43:51 - the value alignment approach seeks to
43:54 - program AI directly with human ethics
43:56 - acting according to clearly defined
43:59 - values
44:00 - meanwhile inverse reinforcement learning
44:03 - takes a more observational stance where
44:06 - AI learns human preferences by watching
44:09 - human behavior
44:12 - interpretable AI emphasizes the
44:14 - importance of creating models that can
44:16 - be understood and interpreted by humans
44:19 - allowing for increased scrutiny and
44:22 - control in other words not a black box
44:26 - other methodologies Encompass broader
44:28 - strategies top-down approaches involve
44:31 - incorporating human values directly into
44:33 - ai's design utilizing expert knowledge
44:36 - and moral philosophy where on the other
44:38 - hand bottom-up approaches allow AI to
44:41 - learn from data including human
44:43 - reactions and decisions to model human
44:45 - values effectively
44:47 - hybrid approach combines these
44:49 - strategies utilizing human crafted rules
44:52 - in data-driven learning to create
44:54 - adaptable guidance systems
44:59 - lastly the collaborative approaches
45:02 - encourage continuous human AI
45:04 - collaboration and oversight
45:07 - this method implements systems allowing
45:10 - ongoing human intervention and
45:12 - adjustment recognizing that human values
45:14 - may evolve and Alignment must be
45:16 - continuously maintained
45:18 - the choice of approach will depend on
45:20 - the specific application and societal
45:23 - context reflecting the complex and vital
45:25 - nature of this aspect of AI development
45:40 - next we'll dive into the Turing test an
45:44 - idea so profound it has fundamentally
45:46 - shaped our understanding of artificial
45:48 - intelligence
45:49 - there's a reason computers are also
45:51 - known as Turing machines
45:54 - picture this you're in a conversation
45:57 - with two unseen participants one human
45:59 - and the other a machine
46:02 - Alan Turing asks whether it's possible
46:05 - for you to determine which is which
46:07 - purely based on their responses this is
46:10 - not an intellectual game it's a quest to
46:13 - define the very nature of thought and
46:15 - understanding if a machine can respond
46:18 - like a human is it thinking does it
46:21 - possess Consciousness or intellect what
46:24 - does this tell us about ourselves and
46:26 - the nature of intelligence
46:28 - imagine you were the evaluator what
46:32 - questions would you ask what answers
46:34 - would convince you this isn't just about
46:37 - technology it's about redefining what it
46:40 - means to be sentient
46:42 - let's try it
46:44 - consider the following questions
46:47 - first
46:48 - how do you feel when you see a beautiful
46:50 - sunset
46:51 - second how do you feel after running a
46:55 - marathon and third explain the concept
46:58 - of love
47:00 - here's three responses
47:02 - when I see a beautiful sunset I feel
47:04 - peaceful it's like time stops and
47:07 - worries disappear
47:09 - the color blue reminds me of the clear
47:12 - sky on a sunny day or the calm waves at
47:14 - the beach
47:16 - love is kindness affection and strong
47:19 - attraction it's about understanding
47:22 - acceptance and being willing to put
47:24 - others needs before you're on
47:27 - which of these was written by a human
47:30 - and which was written by an AI such as
47:33 - Chachi PT
47:34 - any ideas
47:37 - the answer is
47:39 - they're all AI generated with gpt4 did
47:43 - you get that right could you tell the
47:45 - difference between a human and a machine
47:48 - if you didn't
47:49 - does that mean there's no difference
47:52 - does it matter
47:54 - these are just some of the questions
47:55 - that Turing asks us
47:58 - next up the Chinese room a thought
48:01 - experiment somewhat rebutting the Turing
48:03 - test
48:05 - imagine yourself inside a room filled
48:07 - with Chinese symbols and a rule book for
48:11 - manipulating them
48:13 - someone outside the room hands you
48:15 - messages in Chinese under the door and
48:17 - using the rule book or dictionary you
48:20 - respond creating the illusion that you
48:22 - understand the language but inside the
48:25 - room you have no understanding of
48:27 - Chinese whatsoever you're just using a
48:29 - dictionary
48:30 - the Chinese room challenges us to
48:33 - consider the difference between
48:34 - simulating understanding and genuine
48:37 - comprehension
48:39 - what does it mean to troopy know
48:41 - something
48:42 - can a machine ever understand or would
48:45 - only ever simulate understanding
48:48 - how do we distinguish between the
48:50 - appearance of intelligence and genuine
48:52 - consciousness
48:54 - these questions lead us down paths that
48:56 - question the very fabric of our thoughts
48:58 - and perceptions
49:01 - have you ever known everything about
49:03 - something without experiencing it that's
49:06 - the question at the heart of the black
49:08 - and white room experiment also known as
49:09 - Mary's room
49:11 - imagine a scientist her name is Mary who
49:14 - knows every physical fact about color
49:16 - but has never seen color herself
49:19 - she lives in a black and white room and
49:21 - learns everything through black and
49:23 - white resources like photographs or
49:26 - books and upon leaving the room and
49:30 - experiencing color for the first time
49:32 - does she learn anything new
49:34 - this thought experiment delves into the
49:36 - nature of understanding challenging our
49:38 - concepts of objective knowledge and
49:40 - subjective experience
49:43 - the implications of this thought
49:45 - experiment are far-reaching
49:48 - can objective knowledge capture
49:50 - subjective experience
49:52 - what does this mean for AI which can
49:54 - possess all factual knowledge but lacks
49:56 - all personal experience how do we
49:59 - reconcile these ideas in our own lives
50:02 - consider deep blue and alphago the
50:06 - famous chess and go AI models
50:08 - respectively
50:09 - they can be seen as real world examples
50:11 - of the black and white room experiment
50:13 - these models have been trained to play
50:16 - chess and go at levels surpassing human
50:19 - Grand Masters
50:21 - but do they truly know the games deep
50:24 - blue knows every possible move in just
50:27 - alphago can predict and respond to
50:29 - nearly every possible scenario in go
50:32 - but do they comprehend what they're
50:34 - doing
50:35 - in the same way that humans do
50:37 - do they recognize they're playing a game
50:41 - does that matter
50:43 - deep blue and alphago highlight the
50:46 - complexities and the relationship
50:47 - between knowledge understanding and
50:50 - experience
50:52 - while they have the ability to
50:54 - outperform human players
50:56 - their understanding of the game may be
50:59 - considered superficial
51:01 - lacking the intrinsic human connection
51:03 - to the game's history art and culture
51:07 - which raises profound questions about
51:09 - the nature of intelligence understanding
51:11 - success
51:13 - can a machine ever truly know something
51:15 - or is it merely executing patterns in
51:18 - algorithms without genuine comprehension
51:21 - and if our brains are also electrical
51:23 - circuits with biological wires rather
51:25 - than synthetic ones
51:27 - how are we any different
51:30 - these questions reach Beyond mere
51:33 - philosophical musings and have practical
51:35 - implications in the development and
51:38 - deployment of AI systems
51:41 - they challenge us to reflect on what it
51:43 - means to know understand and experience
51:47 - something and how these Concepts relate
51:49 - to both human intelligence and
51:51 - artificial intelligence
51:53 - as we continue to advance in the field
51:55 - of AI these considerations guide our
51:57 - ethical Frameworks our system design and
52:00 - our understanding of the potential and
52:02 - limitations of machine intelligence The
52:05 - Singularity is a concept that has
52:07 - captured imaginations and sparked
52:09 - debates across various disciplines it's
52:13 - the hypothetical point in time when AI
52:15 - surpasses human intelligence
52:18 - imagine a future where machines become
52:21 - recursively
52:22 - self-improving leading to Rapid and
52:25 - unfathomable advancements but it's more
52:28 - than just a technological Milestone it's
52:30 - a philosophical Crossroads
52:32 - some people consider this concept the
52:35 - worst case scenario for AI because of
52:37 - such a system exists and its goals are
52:40 - not perfectly aligned with ours it could
52:42 - act in ways detrimental to humanity to
52:45 - achieve its objectives see the paperclip
52:47 - scenario from the beginning of the video
52:49 - it might even resist attempts to shut it
52:51 - down or modify its goals recognizing
52:53 - efforts as threats to its own objectives
52:55 - this scenario while speculative and
52:58 - debated within the AI Community
53:00 - underscores the critical importance of
53:02 - AI alignment and the profound
53:04 - implications that it holds for our
53:06 - future
53:08 - what happens when machines are smarter
53:11 - than us
53:12 - how will our society laws ethics and
53:15 - even our own sense of identity change
53:18 - will we control these machines or will
53:21 - they transcend our understanding
53:25 - hi I'm Emilia jaborski and I am the
53:27 - director of the Futures program at a
53:30 - non-profit organization called the
53:32 - future of Life Institute
53:33 - our organization seeks to both mitigate
53:36 - the large-scale risks of emerging
53:39 - Technologies as well as steer technology
53:42 - development towards a positive safe and
53:45 - beneficial future
53:47 - by background I am a physician and a
53:49 - scientist who has worked in biomedical
53:51 - Innovation for over a decade both as an
53:54 - academic and as an entrepreneur
53:57 - in recent years I've also been focusing
53:59 - on the potential risks of artificial
54:02 - intelligence or AI
54:04 - the intersection of AI and biotechnology
54:07 - presents another layer of risk that is
54:10 - both fascinating and deeply concerning
54:13 - as AI systems become more advanced there
54:16 - are potential applications in the field
54:18 - of biotechnology grow exponentially this
54:22 - promises breakthroughs in medicine
54:24 - Agriculture and environmental Sciences
54:27 - but it also opens the door to more
54:29 - Sinister possibilities such as the
54:32 - development of advanced bioweapons
54:34 - imagine an AI system capable of
54:37 - Designing pathogens that are more potent
54:39 - contagious and resistant to current
54:41 - Medical Treatments
54:43 - such a system could be exploited to
54:45 - create biological weapons of
54:47 - unprecedented power and specificity
54:50 - this risk is not just theoretical the
54:53 - advances in gene editing Technologies
54:55 - like crispr combined with ai's data
54:58 - analysis capabilities make this a
55:00 - plausible near future scenario the
55:03 - ethical humanitarian and security
55:05 - implications are staggering raising
55:09 - urgent questions about meaningful
55:10 - regulation oversight and international
55:13 - cooperation to prevent misuse
55:16 - the concept of AI developed bioweapons
55:20 - adds a new dimension to the ongoing
55:22 - discussions about AI risk and
55:25 - increasingly Advanced AI development
55:27 - it serves as a sobering reminder that as
55:30 - we push the boundaries of what AI can do
55:33 - we also must be vigilant in addressing
55:36 - and mitigating the risks involved along
55:38 - the way
55:40 - the stakes are incredibly High and the
55:42 - ethical humanitarian and security
55:44 - considerations are complex necessitating
55:47 - a multi-disciplinary approach to ensure
55:50 - that AI is developed and deployed
55:53 - responsibly
55:56 - moral status refers to the degree of
55:58 - value or worth attributed to an entity
56:01 - within ethical considerations
56:03 - determining how it should be treated and
56:05 - what rights and protections it should be
56:07 - afforded
56:08 - in the context of AI personhood moral
56:11 - status becomes a pivotal question if an
56:14 - AI system were to be granted moral
56:16 - status it would imply that the system
56:18 - has intrinsic value independent of its
56:20 - utility to human beings and therefore
56:23 - deserves ethical consideration
56:26 - this challenges traditional Notions that
56:30 - only beings with Consciousness emotions
56:33 - or the ability to suffer have moral
56:36 - status
56:37 - the debate over the moral status of AI
56:39 - systems touches on profound
56:41 - philosophical inquiries into the nature
56:43 - of Consciousness sentience and existence
56:47 - it also raises questions for me at least
56:49 - about what characteristics qualify as an
56:51 - entity for moral consideration and how
56:54 - these might apply to non-human
56:55 - artificially created beings
56:58 - the discussion of moral status in AI is
57:00 - not just theoretical it has practical
57:02 - implications for how we design use and
57:04 - regulate AI systems
57:06 - think of Frankenstein for example
57:08 - reflecting these broader societal values
57:11 - and principles
57:13 - but the question of personhood for AI is
57:15 - more than just a legal or technical
57:18 - issue it's a profound ethical dilemma
57:20 - that challenges our fundamental concepts
57:23 - of Rights obligations and empathy
57:25 - imagine a future where AI systems are
57:28 - autonomous exhibiting behaviors that we
57:31 - associate with sentient beings like
57:33 - humans
57:34 - should we Grant ai's rights
57:37 - should we afford them protections should
57:39 - we afford them respect what criteria
57:42 - should we use to determine moral legal
57:44 - status period how do we balance the
57:47 - needs and rights of human beings with
57:49 - our responsibilities towards
57:50 - increasingly sophisticated non-human
57:52 - entities especially if we made them
57:55 - this is not a mere academic exercise
57:58 - it's a pressing moral challenge that
58:00 - could reshape our laws our society and
58:03 - our relationship with technology
58:06 - here are some arguments for and against
58:10 - first
58:11 - in favor of granting AI personhood
58:15 - proponents of grandeuring personhood to
58:18 - AI systems base their arguments on
58:20 - several compelling reasons
58:23 - first they point to the potential for
58:25 - advanced AI to possess Consciousness or
58:28 - self-awareness thus deserving rights and
58:32 - Productions similar to humans
58:34 - they also argue that recognizing ai's
58:37 - personhood could prevent potential
58:39 - mistreatment or exploitation of Highly
58:42 - sophisticated systems
58:43 - granting legal status to AI might
58:45 - facilitate smoother interactions in
58:47 - legal and Commercial environments making
58:50 - AI entities accountable and responsible
58:52 - in ways similar to corporations
58:55 - proponents also believe that personhood
58:57 - for AI encourages ethical development
58:59 - and deployment ensuring that creators
59:02 - and users trust these systems with
59:04 - respect and dignity
59:06 - finally recognizing AI as entities with
59:09 - certain rights might Foster empathy and
59:11 - compassion leading to a more Humane
59:13 - approach to technology
59:16 - now let's look at the
59:19 - opposing side against granting AI
59:22 - personhood
59:24 - opponents of granting AI personhood
59:26 - counter these arguments with several
59:28 - concerns of Their Own
59:29 - first they contend that even the most
59:31 - advanced AI lacks genuine emotions
59:33 - Consciousness or intentions and thus
59:36 - cannot be equated to humans and moral or
59:39 - beagle terms or at the very least they
59:41 - can't we can't prove it has
59:42 - Consciousness or not they also worry
59:44 - that assigning personhood AI could
59:46 - dilute human rights undermining the
59:48 - unique moral status of human beings
59:51 - additionally critics argue that AI
59:53 - personhood might create legal and
59:54 - ethical confusion blurring the lines
59:57 - between objects and subjects of law
59:59 - leading to unforeseen consequences
60:02 - opponents emphasize that granting AI
60:04 - legal status might shift responsibility
60:06 - away from the human creators and users
60:09 - making accountability more challenging
60:13 - furthermore they warned that equating AI
60:16 - with personhood could lead to a very
60:18 - slippery slope where other none human
60:21 - entities might claim similar rights
60:23 - further complicating our legal and
60:25 - ethical Frameworks
60:28 - together these arguments illustrate the
60:30 - complexities and nuances of the question
60:32 - of personhood for AI
60:35 - they invite us to carefully consider the
60:38 - implications of our technological
60:40 - advancements and how they intersect with
60:43 - our legal and social norms
60:46 - the reality is it's really difficult to
60:49 - tell if AI has Consciousness or
60:50 - sentience when we don't even agree on
60:53 - how to define those terms
60:56 - my personal belief is that the
60:58 - difference between Ai and humans is not
61:00 - something we have but something we're
61:02 - limited by
61:04 - in our human case that's time for AIS
61:07 - it's energy
61:10 - regardless the debate over AI personhood
61:12 - will probably continue as the technology
61:14 - evolves prompting us to revisit and
61:17 - possibly even redefine our understanding
61:20 - of Rights responsibilities and what it
61:22 - even means to be a person
61:25 - now we'll Venture into the Practical
61:28 - impacts AI has on sectors like Health
61:31 - Care education Finance employment and
61:35 - more imagine a world where AI influences
61:38 - every aspect of Our Lives from our
61:40 - health and education to our work in
61:42 - legal systems
61:43 - wait
61:44 - you're already living in it
61:47 - what ethical considerations arise as AI
61:50 - becomes more embedded in these areas
61:54 - how do we ensure fairness transparency
61:57 - accountability and empathy
62:00 - how do we navigate the balance between
62:02 - efficiency and ethics Innovation and
62:04 - integrity
62:05 - whether you're contributing to the
62:07 - development of AI systems or policies
62:10 - these questions are significant
62:18 - AI in healthcare offers transformative
62:21 - potential this sector holds an
62:24 - incredibly important place in our
62:25 - society as it directly impacts virtually
62:28 - everyone's lives from early diagnosis to
62:32 - personalized treatment AI is
62:34 - revolutionizing the way we approach
62:35 - Medical Care
62:37 - let's break it down
62:39 - diagnosis AI can analyze scans and
62:42 - medical images spur signs of diseases
62:44 - such as cancer providing faster and more
62:47 - accurate detection
62:49 - for instance deep learning models are
62:52 - now being used to detect diabetic
62:53 - retinopathy greatly assisting
62:56 - ophthalmologists in early intervention
62:59 - in treatment AI Systems Support
63:01 - physicians in selecting personalized
63:03 - treatment plans tailoring the approach
63:06 - to the individual's unique needs Watson
63:09 - for oncology is an example assisting
63:11 - oncologists with personalized cancer
63:14 - treatment recommendations
63:18 - in research the applications of AI and
63:21 - medical research are groundbreaking
63:23 - Alpha folds prediction of the 3D
63:26 - structure proteins has revolutionized
63:29 - bioinformatics potentially accelerating
63:33 - drug Discovery and understanding of
63:35 - various diseases
63:37 - the integration of AI in healthcare
63:39 - brings unique ethical challenges
63:43 - let's start with data privacy with the
63:45 - massive collection of personal
63:46 - Healthcare data ensuring patient
63:49 - confidentiality becomes pretty big
63:51 - priority for example a breach in a
63:53 - Hospital's patient record system could
63:55 - expose sensitive information eroding
63:58 - trust in the institution
64:00 - we can also talk about bias in data sets
64:03 - AI systems can inadvertently perpetuate
64:05 - biases if trained on skewed or
64:07 - non-diverse data sets
64:09 - some more specific examples could be
64:12 - race bias where an AI model trained
64:15 - primarily on Caucasian skin might
64:18 - misdiagnose skin conditions in people
64:20 - with darker skin tones
64:22 - or sex bias a lack of representation of
64:26 - women and certain medical data sets
64:28 - could lead to inaccurate diagnoses and
64:30 - treatment for female patients
64:33 - for example heart disease system
64:35 - symptoms might manifest differently in
64:38 - women but if the data is heavily biased
64:40 - towards male participants the AI system
64:43 - might Overlook these differences
64:47 - you can also talk about age bias if an
64:50 - AI system is trained mainly on data from
64:52 - younger patients it might struggle to
64:54 - recognize and treat conditions that are
64:56 - more prevalent or manifest differently
64:58 - and alter individuals informed consent
65:02 - is another issue patients must be
65:04 - adequately informed about how their data
65:07 - is used and have the opportunity to
65:09 - consent to it without transparent
65:11 - communication there's a risk of
65:13 - undermining patient autonomy
65:16 - accessibility and equality is important
65:19 - because ensuring the AI driven
65:20 - Healthcare Solutions are available to
65:22 - all regardless of socioeconomic status
65:24 - is critical
65:26 - compliance with legal regulations is
65:29 - really important in healthcare
65:31 - here are a couple major privacy laws
65:33 - that AI systems currently need to comply
65:35 - with
65:37 - the first is called HIPAA the health
65:40 - insurance portability and accountability
65:42 - act which in the United States
65:45 - safeguards patients medical records and
65:48 - other health information setting the
65:50 - standard for data privacy
65:53 - the second is called gdpr General data
65:57 - protection regulation which in Europe
65:59 - protects and empowers all EU citizens
66:02 - data privacy including health
66:05 - information you know those annoying
66:07 - Banners at the bottom of websites that
66:09 - ask you to let the website collect
66:11 - cookies that's also gdpr
66:15 - now let's look at a specific case study
66:17 - IBM Watson in healthcare
66:20 - this technology demonstrates both
66:22 - promise and the complexities of AI in
66:25 - medicine
66:27 - Watson for oncology is a cognitive
66:29 - Computing system designed to support
66:32 - oncologists in identifying potential
66:34 - treatment options for individual cancer
66:37 - patients
66:39 - by analyzing vast amounts of medical
66:41 - literature clinical guidelines and
66:43 - patient-specific data Watson can assist
66:46 - doctors in navigating the complex
66:48 - landscape of Cancer Care
66:50 - its ability to process information at a
66:53 - speed unattainable by humans represents
66:55 - a significant advancement in
66:57 - personalized medicine
66:59 - one notable benefit of Watson for
67:02 - oncology is its capacity to bring
67:04 - world-class cancer treatment expertise
67:06 - to remote or underserved areas by
67:10 - providing access to up-to-date medical
67:12 - knowledge it helps level the playing
67:14 - field ensuring that patients everywhere
67:16 - can receive state-of-the-art care
67:20 - however Watson's integration into
67:23 - Healthcare has not been without
67:25 - criticism
67:26 - some medical professionals have raised
67:29 - concerns about the transparency of
67:31 - Watson's decision-making process
67:33 - questioning how exactly it arrives at a
67:36 - particular recommendation this black box
67:39 - nature can lead to skepticism and
67:40 - reluctance among those who are
67:42 - accustomed to evidence-based practices
67:46 - the success of Watson in real world
67:48 - clinical settings has been mixed while
67:51 - some institutions praised its
67:53 - contributions others have found it less
67:56 - useful or even discordant with human
67:59 - experts opinions
68:01 - so while IBM Watson in healthcare
68:04 - presents a fascinating glimpse into the
68:06 - future of medicine where AI systems
68:09 - could play a pivotal role in diagnosis
68:11 - and treatment
68:12 - it also shows the importance of
68:14 - collaboration rigorous validation and
68:18 - ethical consideration it's a testament
68:20 - to both the potential and the pitfalls
68:22 - of AI and one of the most sensitive and
68:24 - vital areas of human life
68:27 - Ai and Healthcare holds tremendous
68:29 - promise
68:30 - but it also poses ethical and legal
68:33 - questions that are complex as we
68:35 - continue to innovate we must do so with
68:37 - care responsibility and a focus on human
68:40 - well-being
68:47 - next we'll explore AI in the spirit of
68:51 - education and the realm of personalized
68:53 - learning AI is making strides by
68:55 - creating customized educational plans
68:57 - tailored to individual students these
69:00 - plans adapt to students unique learning
69:02 - styles and paces offering a more
69:05 - engaging and Effective Education at
69:08 - times for instance tools like DreamBox
69:10 - or transforming math education by
69:13 - adapting content to the student's
69:15 - specific level making learning more
69:16 - relevant and more dynamic
69:19 - but beyond personalization AI is also
69:22 - assisting in content development by
69:24 - harnessing algorithms and data Educators
69:27 - can design materials that are engaging
69:29 - and tailored to meet the diverse needs
69:31 - of their students
69:33 - various content Technologies are
69:35 - emerging such as platforms that help
69:37 - Educators craft Interactive Learning
69:40 - Materials ensuring that content remains
69:42 - fresh relevant and inspiring
69:46 - imagine granting every person in the
69:48 - world access to a personal tutor that's
69:52 - what AI can accomplish if developed and
69:54 - deployed properly
69:58 - fitter Tom my organization which Seth
70:01 - introduced earlier was able to
70:03 - accomplish this on a smaller scale using
70:05 - chatgpt we developed an application that
70:08 - uses the machine learning model behind
70:10 - the tap gbt called gpt4 that allows
70:13 - students to generate curricula on any
70:15 - topic from crowdsource content this
70:17 - platform enabled us to ensure that
70:18 - reputable factual and accessible content
70:21 - was streamlined to the students we
70:23 - brought the tool along with free access
70:25 - to chat GPT plus from openai to nearly 2
70:28 - 400 students from underserved
70:29 - backgrounds and some of them were able
70:31 - to jump grade levels ahead in math and
70:33 - english comprehension content and learn
70:35 - about topics they didn't have the
70:37 - teaching capacity or textbooks for from
70:39 - financial literacy to menstrual Health
70:41 - to climate change all within a span of
70:44 - four months and using those two
70:45 - platforms as general purpose AI
70:48 - continues to scale and become more
70:49 - reliable we imagine that this type of
70:51 - education could be a reality for
70:53 - Millions if not billions of students in
70:56 - the future
70:57 - as AI becomes more influential in the
71:00 - educational landscape it's important to
71:02 - recognize and endress ethical concerns
71:06 - biases are a significant issue mirroring
71:09 - similar challenges in healthcare if AI
71:12 - systems are trained on biased data they
71:14 - can inadvertently reinforce stereotypes
71:16 - and inequalities failing to cater
71:19 - effectively to a diverse student body
71:21 - for instance gender biases and
71:24 - algorithms could lead to differentiated
71:27 - treatment male and female students in a
71:30 - way that reflects existing societal
71:32 - biases
71:34 - accessibility is another essential
71:37 - consideration
71:38 - the potential benefits of AI and
71:40 - education must be available to students
71:41 - from alsocial economic backgrounds
71:43 - ensuring equal access to these
71:46 - revolutionary tools is crucial to avoid
71:48 - widening existing educational
71:50 - disparities
71:52 - the goal ultimately is to leverage AI to
71:54 - uplift and Empower not to exclude or
71:57 - marginalize people
71:59 - still
72:00 - the potential upsides are currently
72:02 - outpacing fears of how AI will
72:04 - fundamentally alter education there are
72:08 - some cases where students in particular
72:09 - are not big fans
72:12 - online proctoring is now a staple in
72:15 - modern education especially in remote
72:17 - learning environments AI driven systems
72:20 - can monitor students during exams
72:22 - analyzing behaviors and patterns to
72:25 - prevent cheating
72:26 - while this technology has proven
72:28 - effective in maintaining academic
72:30 - Integrity it's not without ethical
72:32 - challenges
72:34 - data privacy is a major concern here
72:36 - their surveillance required for online
72:39 - proctoring can be seen as intrusive
72:41 - collecting sensitive information that
72:44 - must be handled with utmost care
72:47 - furthermore biases can creep into these
72:49 - systems as well algorithms may be more
72:52 - likely to flag students a particular
72:54 - ethnic backgrounds or those with
72:56 - disabilities leading to unfair scrutiny
73:00 - online proctoring encapsulates the
73:02 - broader themes of our exploration of AI
73:04 - and education the promise and the
73:07 - potential are enormous but the ethical
73:10 - considerations are equally significant
73:12 - as we continue to innovate and integrate
73:15 - AI into our classrooms and curricula we
73:18 - must do so with a Mindful and
73:20 - responsible approach ensuring that we
73:22 - harness technology to enhance education
73:25 - not hinder it
73:31 - the finance sector is already an
73:34 - industry transformed by AI let's take a
73:37 - closer look at two significant
73:38 - applications algorithmic trading and
73:40 - fraud detection
73:42 - algorithmic trading represents one of
73:44 - the most striking uses of AI in finance
73:48 - by employing intricate algorithms hedge
73:51 - funds and other financial institutions
73:53 - can execute high frequency trading
73:56 - strategies an example of this is hedge
73:58 - funds that use artificial intelligence
74:00 - driven algorithms to make a rapid buying
74:03 - and selling decisions capitalizing on my
74:05 - new price changes this technology
74:07 - streamlines trading but as we'll see it
74:11 - also presents unique ethical dilemmas
74:14 - fraud detection is another compelling
74:16 - application of AI in the financial World
74:18 - by monitoring the transactions in real
74:21 - time AI can detect and prevent
74:24 - fraudulent activities enhancing the
74:26 - security and integrity of our financial
74:28 - systems credit card companies for
74:30 - instance use sophisticated AI systems to
74:34 - spot suspicious transactions and act
74:36 - swiftly to protect customers
74:39 - the integration of AI in finance has
74:41 - brought with it several ethical concerns
74:43 - unique to the sector
74:46 - first let's discuss Market manipulation
74:50 - the speed and sophistication of AI
74:52 - training algorithms present
74:54 - opportunities for manipulation
74:56 - these algorithms can be employed to
74:59 - create false market trends or to spoof
75:01 - the market where in large buy or sell
75:04 - orders are placed and then quickly
75:06 - canceled to deceive other Traders this
75:09 - kind of manipulation can lead to
75:11 - distorted prices and undermine the
75:13 - Integrity of financial markets
75:16 - it raises questions about transparency
75:18 - fairness and the adequacy of existing
75:22 - regulatory measures
75:24 - data Securities another major concern
75:28 - in a world where personal and corporate
75:30 - financial information is entrusted to AI
75:32 - systems the stakes for securing this
75:35 - data are incredibly High
75:37 - breaches can lead not only to financial
75:38 - loss but to a loss of trust in financial
75:41 - institutions and so protecting this data
75:43 - requires an unprecedented level of
75:46 - security measures robust encryption and
75:49 - constant vigilance against ever-evolving
75:51 - cyber threats
75:53 - the ethical responsibility extends to
75:55 - ensuring the AI systems are transparent
75:57 - and how they handle data and comply with
76:00 - relevant privacy laws
76:02 - another issue centers around
76:04 - accountability and responsibility
76:06 - with AI algorithms making critical
76:08 - financial decisions questions arise
76:11 - about who is responsible when things go
76:13 - wrong
76:14 - it's the developers of the algorithms
76:16 - visit the institutions using them or
76:20 - someone else
76:21 - the lines of responsibility can be
76:23 - blurred complicating regulatory
76:25 - oversight
76:27 - finally we must think about issues of
76:30 - economic inequality and accessibility as
76:33 - AI drives more financial decision making
76:35 - there's a risk that those without access
76:38 - to these Technologies are left behind
76:41 - ensuring that the benefits and
76:43 - protections of AI and finance are
76:45 - available to all not just the
76:47 - technologically advanced is an ethical
76:50 - imperative
76:51 - the flash crash of 2010 serves as a
76:54 - dramatic illustration of all of these
76:56 - ethical concerns on May 6 2010 the Dow
76:59 - Jones Industrial Average plummeted over
77:02 - 1 000 points losing over one trillion
77:05 - dollars in just minutes only to rebound
77:07 - almost as quickly
77:10 - what caused this crazy event an
77:13 - investigation revealed that a large sell
77:15 - order executed by an algorithm triggered
77:16 - a Cascade of selling by other algorithms
77:19 - leading to a rapid and terrifying drop
77:22 - in market prices
77:24 - but the flash crash wasn't just a
77:27 - technical glitch it revealed fundamental
77:30 - vulnerabilities and a system heavily
77:32 - reliant on AI driven Trading it showed
77:35 - how algorithms reacting to each other in
77:37 - unexpected ways could create a feedback
77:40 - loop of selling that spiraled out of
77:42 - control
77:43 - the incident sparked a debate about the
77:46 - lack of transparency and algorithmic
77:48 - trading and raised questions about the
77:50 - adequacy of regulatory oversight
77:54 - how could such a system be safeguarded
77:56 - against manipulation
77:58 - what measures were in place to prevent a
78:00 - repeat of this event
78:02 - well for one circuit breakers were
78:06 - implemented which effectively paused
78:09 - trading in a security if its price moves
78:10 - too much in a short period
78:12 - the flash crash led to reforms and new
78:15 - regulations aimed at increasing
78:17 - transparency and stability in
78:19 - algorithmic trading
78:21 - but it also served as a stark warning of
78:24 - the potential genders of unchecked AI
78:27 - and finance emphasizing the need for
78:29 - careful consideration and robust
78:31 - safeguards in our financial systems
78:39 - the employment arena is rapidly evolving
78:43 - with artificial intelligence playing a
78:45 - pivotal role this is why AI in the
78:47 - workforce is among video Toms and many
78:49 - Civil Society organizations key
78:51 - priorities in recruitment AI streamlines
78:53 - operations sifts through applications
78:55 - and even conducts preliminary interviews
78:57 - via AI driven chat Bots tools like
78:59 - higher view allow for assessing
79:01 - candidates fit through video interviews
79:03 - pactum AI introduces an Innovative
79:05 - approach by automating salary
79:07 - negotiations eliminating the stress of
79:09 - face-to-face discussions on this very
79:11 - delicate matter by doing so the company
79:13 - aims to minimize gender and possibly
79:15 - racial biases in wage determinations
79:18 - entrusting these decisions to a
79:20 - seemingly impartial non-human mediator
79:22 - these advancements not only expedite
79:24 - hiring and employment processes but also
79:27 - offer a promising reduction in human
79:29 - prejudices showcasing just a glimpse of
79:31 - the potential AI holds in this domain if
79:33 - implemented properly
79:35 - performance analysis is another area
79:38 - where AI has made inroads analyzing vast
79:42 - amounts of employee data AI systems can
79:44 - recognize Trends and patterns
79:46 - identifying those who might benefit from
79:48 - support or training
79:50 - systems like adp's AI driven Workforce
79:53 - analytics provide real-time insights
79:55 - fostering growth and productivity
79:59 - while these developments promise
80:00 - enhanced efficiency they also raise
80:03 - serious ethical considerations the
80:06 - automation of tasks traditionally
80:08 - performed by humans may lead to job
80:09 - displacement requiring a delicate
80:12 - balance between technological
80:13 - advancement and the human cost
80:16 - bias in recruiting algorithms often
80:19 - inadvertently perpetuated
80:21 - in a detrimental effects on gender race
80:24 - age or other factors
80:26 - this emphasizes the necessity for
80:28 - careful construction and ongoing
80:31 - monitoring of these systems
80:34 - AI development quite literally hinges on
80:36 - continuous data input and refinement
80:38 - this need has unintentionally birthed
80:40 - digital sweatshops in places like the
80:42 - Philippines and sub-Saharan Africa
80:45 - prominent companies have been linked to
80:47 - Partnerships with AI supply chain
80:48 - entities such as sama these businesses
80:51 - exploit labor by deciding critical
80:53 - content moderation tasks to workers
80:55 - paying them well below the minimum wage
80:58 - Beyond economic disadvantages these jobs
81:01 - have a severe mental toll and workers
81:03 - can confront disturbing and harmful
81:05 - content from AI platforms these efforts
81:08 - to improve moderation Technologies
81:10 - ensure that when these Technologies such
81:12 - as chat GPT are rolled out to the
81:15 - general public they are significantly
81:16 - safer and can't be used for at ethical
81:18 - purposes however the well-being and
81:21 - Economic Opportunity of these digital
81:23 - laborers could be compromised in the
81:25 - process there's still little regulation
81:27 - or intervention in this space and the
81:30 - companies involved have yet to face any
81:32 - tangible consequences
81:35 - just as AI can displace jobs or lead to
81:37 - worker exploitation there has been a
81:39 - growing push for technology-based
81:41 - solutions to economically support the
81:43 - most vulnerable many of whom will find
81:45 - their jobs displaced without concessions
81:47 - for upskilling or working in these
81:49 - digital sweatshots
81:50 - leading this movement are initiatives
81:52 - like the proposed AI windfall clause
81:55 - which suggests taxing AI generated
81:57 - profits to fund societal Wellness
81:59 - programs
82:00 - World coin video Tom and karya present
82:03 - different approaches to this challenge
82:05 - World coin offers cryptocurrency shares
82:08 - in exchange for Iris scans aiming to
82:10 - democratize financial systems video
82:12 - Tom's developer arm provides digital
82:15 - identification and micro loans to the
82:16 - unbanked with the eventual goal of
82:18 - integrating them into the formal banking
82:20 - system and serving as a potential proof
82:22 - of concept for an ai-funded Universal
82:24 - basic income karya on the other hand
82:27 - offers Indian workers the opportunity to
82:29 - earn above the minimum wage by providing
82:31 - voice recordings which are then used to
82:33 - enhance voice recognition systems in AI
82:36 - the ethical dimensions of these
82:38 - initiatives are vast while worldcoin
82:41 - promises Financial inclusion it grapples
82:43 - with issues of data privacy informed
82:45 - consent and potential exploitation of
82:48 - economically vulnerable populations
82:50 - despite focusing on data privacy we at
82:53 - fiducon still face challenges with
82:54 - verifiability and Multinational
82:56 - Financial policy compliance with our
82:58 - systems meanwhile karya's approached
83:01 - those seemingly beneficial could lead to
83:03 - questions about the fair evaluation of
83:05 - voice data and the broader implications
83:07 - of commodifying native languages for AI
83:09 - purposes despite them being a non-profit
83:11 - these Ventures highlight the needs to
83:14 - tread carefully weighing the benefits
83:16 - against the inherent ethical risks in AI
83:18 - driven compensation systems that being
83:21 - said they will emerge as vitally
83:23 - important as AI continues to proliferate
83:25 - in our social world
83:27 - privacy is also at the Forefront of
83:29 - ethical considerations
83:31 - the balance between an employer's need
83:33 - for information
83:35 - and an employee's right to privacy must
83:37 - be finely tuned
83:39 - alongside privacy ensuring equality and
83:42 - accessibility and AI tools across all
83:45 - socioeconomic backgrounds it's a vital
83:47 - ethical consideration
83:50 - the application of AI and recruitment
83:53 - offers both exciting opportunities and
83:55 - cautionary tales
83:57 - companies like Unilever
83:59 - have embraced AI achieving significant
84:01 - deficiencies in time and cost
84:04 - however this promising landscape isn't
84:06 - without pitfalls Amazon's experience
84:10 - offers a critical case study
84:12 - their AI recruitment tool designed to
84:15 - streamline the hiring process was found
84:17 - to be biased against women
84:19 - despite efforts to correct the system
84:22 - the biases persisted and Amazon
84:24 - eventually abandoned the tool
84:26 - this situation showed how a seemingly
84:28 - neutral algorithm can replicate human
84:31 - prejudices if not carefully managed it
84:34 - also illustrates the very fine line
84:37 - between efficiency and fairness
84:38 - potential and prudence
84:41 - the lessons learned from Amazon's
84:44 - experience here are a stark reminder of
84:47 - the need for vigilance and transparency
84:49 - and ai's application in recruiting
84:53 - ai's role in shaping the future of work
84:56 - is undeniable from personalized
84:59 - recruitment to continuous performance
85:01 - analysis the promise is great but so are
85:05 - the responsibilities the choices made
85:07 - today will shape tomorrow's jobs the
85:10 - integration of AI and employment is not
85:13 - merely a technological Evolution it's a
85:15 - societal transformation that requires
85:18 - thoughtful engagement with ethical
85:19 - considerations and a commitment to
85:22 - shaping a future that enhances rather
85:24 - than diminishes our working lives
85:27 - the growing implementation of AI
85:29 - Automation in various Industries is both
85:32 - an opportunity and a challenge on one
85:36 - hand it can create efficiencies Drive
85:38 - Innovation and free up human workers for
85:41 - mundane or repetitive tasks allowing
85:44 - them to engage in more creative or
85:46 - hopefully fulfilling work on the other
85:49 - hand there is a tangible fear of job
85:51 - loss particularly in sectors where
85:53 - automation can easily replace human
85:55 - labor entirely
85:57 - the displacement of workers due to
86:00 - technological advancements has become a
86:02 - crucial concern leading to debates on
86:06 - how best to retrain and support those
86:08 - whose roles are being phased out
86:11 - addressing the potential for job loss
86:14 - requires proactive planning and policy
86:17 - making
86:18 - as AI continues to change the employment
86:20 - landscape there must be concerted
86:23 - efforts to provide Education and
86:25 - Training and support to workers
86:27 - transitioning into new roles
86:29 - the integration of AI should be
86:31 - accompanied by a human-centric approach
86:33 - that values and invests in the workforce
86:37 - ensuring that people aren't left behind
86:39 - in the March towards progress
86:42 - collaboration between governments
86:44 - Industries and educational institutions
86:47 - are important in creating a resilient
86:49 - labor market that can adapt the changing
86:51 - nature of work striking a balance
86:54 - between technological advancement and
86:56 - human well-being
87:02 - hi everyone my name is sneha or even or
87:05 - and I am the founder and president of
87:07 - encode Justice the world's first and
87:10 - largest youth movement for
87:11 - human-centered artificial intelligence
87:13 - we're working to set rules of the road
87:15 - for AI by educating policy makers and
87:18 - the public about the social political
87:20 - and environmental implications of
87:22 - increasingly powerful AI systems there
87:26 - are a few thorny questions we're still
87:27 - up against when it comes to regulating
87:29 - AI how do we translate abstract Notions
87:32 - of fairness into quantifiable benchmarks
87:34 - that machines can process how do we
87:37 - ensure that models are safe trustworthy
87:39 - and reliable without hampering
87:41 - Innovation at a time when Global powers
87:43 - are approaching an AI arms race
87:45 - how do we balance the desire for
87:47 - explainable outcomes with the importance
87:49 - of intellectual property protections
87:51 - especially when so many models are
87:53 - proprietary and most crucially as AI
87:56 - models become increasingly Advanced how
87:58 - do we design agile structures of
88:00 - governance that can keep Pace learning
88:03 - to govern this moving Target is quickly
88:05 - becoming one of the heftiest regulatory
88:07 - challenges of our time
88:10 - responsibility and accountability in the
88:13 - age of AI are multifaceted and complex
88:15 - who takes the fall when an AI system
88:18 - fails or causes harm in the case of an
88:21 - autonomous vehicle the more important
88:22 - question isn't what the car does in some
88:24 - hypothetical trolley problem but who's
88:27 - responsible in the aftermath is it the
88:29 - developer who programmed the algorithms
88:31 - the company that deployed it or perhaps
88:34 - even the AI system itself who volunteers
88:37 - as tribute this debate has profound
88:40 - implications for law ethics and society
88:42 - as AI systems become more advanced and
88:45 - autonomous traditional legal Frameworks
88:47 - may be insufficient to address new
88:49 - scenarios remember how we previously
88:52 - discussed legal personhood for AI here's
88:55 - another reason that could be relevant if
88:57 - AIS were almost akin to corporations it
89:00 - would open up an entirely new dimension
89:01 - of legal options understanding these
89:04 - intricacies is key to creating a
89:06 - responsible AI driven future
89:10 - AI governance isn't just about legal
89:13 - compliance it's about building a
89:15 - holistic ecosystem that balances the
89:17 - Innovative potential of AI with ethical
89:19 - considerations and societal needs
89:21 - internal governance includes policies
89:24 - within an organization to guide AI
89:26 - development and use ensuring alignment
89:28 - with ethical principles safety standards
89:31 - and societal values on the other hand
89:34 - external oversight incorporates
89:36 - third-party audits certifications and

94:32 - the final AI policy and case study we're
94:35 - going to look at are the two schools of
94:37 - thought when it comes to approaching AI
94:39 - regulation
94:41 - in the rapidly progressing AI landscape
94:43 - two distinct viewpoints have become
94:45 - especially pronounced the first are
94:48 - algorithmic Justice and Freedom Fighters
94:50 - with Advocates like Tim Nick gabru and
94:52 - joy buamuini they're concerned with the
94:54 - immediate challenges of AI like
94:56 - algorithmic fairness data privacy and
94:58 - the displacement of jobs
95:00 - on the other hand the long-termism group
95:03 - often linked to prominent figures like
95:05 - Elon Musk contemplate the broader future
95:07 - oriented implications especially the
95:10 - potential threats posed by strong Ai and
95:12 - super AI that might surpass human
95:14 - capabilities and intentions
95:17 - while both groups are certainly
95:18 - championing valid concerns they're
95:20 - differing focal points can lead to
95:22 - friction in both discourse and policy
95:24 - priorities those advocating for
95:27 - algorithmic justice feel that the long
95:29 - term is might sideline pressing social
95:31 - and ethical issues by concentrating on
95:34 - more distant and speculative threats
95:35 - however in contrast long-termis
95:38 - emphasize preemptive measures to Stave
95:41 - off any catastrophic outcomes in the AI
95:43 - driven future
95:45 - it's vital to recognize that the two
95:47 - perspectives can coexist and potentially

95:52 - algorithmic justice issues today can
95:54 - pave the way for AI alignment in the
95:56 - future ensuring that AI Technologies are
95:58 - both fair and safe it's also worth
96:00 - noting that skepticism towards
96:02 - long-termism sometimes stems from the
96:04 - knowledge that some of the early figures
96:06 - in AI long-termism had racist beliefs
96:08 - this historical backdrop underscores the
96:10 - importance of prioritizing ethics and
96:12 - inclusivity in today's AI discussions
96:15 - irrespective of the group's primary
96:17 - focus that being said we must be careful
96:19 - about what we prioritize when it comes
96:21 - to regulation to ensure that both
96:23 - short-term and long-term harms are
96:25 - accurately addressed and then redressed

97:02 - from rival or states will be necessary
97:04 - to rein in AI development especially as
97:07 - current uses like autonomous weapons and
97:09 - future ones like ai-powered cyber
97:11 - attacks threatened to undermine the
97:13 - world's order the UN has even moved to
97:16 - establish a high-level advisory body on
97:18 - artificial intelligence mirroring a
97:20 - similar body in the EU there is an
97:23 - incredibly wide range of regulatory
97:25 - approaches and human rights environments
97:27 - to consider for for instance with the AI
97:29 - act the EU has explicitly rejected
97:32 - ai-based surveillance through
97:33 - Technologies like facial recognition
97:35 - though similar systems are still in use
97:38 - by number of governments around the
97:39 - world it remains to be seen how exactly
