00:03 - hey everybody its Jesse and I hope
00:07 - everyone had a nice weekend and I had I
00:13 - actually did a lot of coding this
00:15 - weekend but not for this project for
00:19 - just a side project for that Udacity
00:22 - course that I'm taking so I wanted to
00:27 - start out by just acknowledging Andrew
00:30 - for his commits so these are all the
00:36 - people who have submitted pull requests
00:39 - to this project appreciate everyone
00:44 - contributing and in this way and I
00:47 - appreciate everyone contributing in the
00:48 - live chat as well in the comments and
00:51 - you all made this project so much better
00:54 - than it would have been if it were just
00:56 - me working on it
00:57 - so anyway Andrew thank you for that and
01:00 - Andrew also had some great ideas to
01:03 - improve the the search function for the
01:07 - resources so I took his ideas and made
01:11 - an issue now I I fully intend to you
01:17 - know do this issue myself at some point
01:19 - but if anybody is interested in this and
01:24 - would like to contribute to a project
01:26 - then this one's up for grabs right now
01:29 - and if you want to learn about you know
01:34 - debouncing then this might be a good one
01:37 - too to start out with alright and I
01:42 - actually had something cool happen right
01:46 - before the stream started and I had like
01:50 - I don't know like ten people waiting and
01:53 - I already had three thumbs up and I
01:55 - hadn't even started yet that was really
01:57 - awesome I don't know if anyone was
01:59 - watching there was one time where I had
02:01 - I had a thumbs down I don't know like
02:04 - ten minutes before I even started and I
02:06 - thought that was hilarious
02:07 - so now that made up for it cuz I had
02:09 - three thumbs up before I even started
02:12 - I appreciate that all right so today I'm
02:19 - gonna be working on this page so I don't
02:25 - know if you've seen this before you
02:26 - might have seen this before cuz I did
02:28 - this a while ago like weeks ago but I
02:32 - never really finished it so right now
02:34 - you can get to it so you can actually go
02:37 - to the live website and if you just type
02:39 - in slash news you can get to it if you
02:43 - click the news button it actually just
02:44 - takes you to the front page and then
02:46 - Scrolls you down there's a news anchor
02:48 - tag to the bottom but this is is
02:52 - actually live it's just not obvious on
02:55 - how to get to it but this is going to
02:58 - end up functioning exactly like a normal
03:01 - blog would function but they're just
03:03 - calling it news so it's basically just
03:08 - gonna display posts and we're gonna have
03:11 - categories and tags and archive so all
03:14 - of this was just hard coded in but
03:17 - what's gonna need to happen is it's
03:18 - gonna need to pull categories tags and
03:21 - tags from WordPress and populate these
03:26 - fields and then we're gonna have to hook
03:29 - this up so that you know when you click
03:30 - one of these it actually changes what
03:33 - appears here the archives will probably
03:38 - have to do I'm not exactly sure left
03:43 - you'll have to figure out something
03:44 - because I can't just I don't think I can
03:46 - just get an API you'll call back to have
03:52 - you know archives I suppose I could make
03:54 - one with a date range that's probably
03:58 - what's gonna happen I think you can make
03:59 - a call to WordPress to get posts within
04:01 - a certain date range that's probably
04:05 - what's gonna happen I mean right now I
04:07 - could grab all the posts immediately and
04:09 - just have filters but eventually if
04:12 - there's a lot of posts then it wouldn't
04:14 - make sense to get every post so it's
04:17 - probably better just to make these be
04:20 - separate API calls and at some point it
04:24 - would be good to set
04:25 - up cashing of API calls because you know
04:35 - people just clicked around back and
04:37 - forth it could end up being a lot so I'd
04:40 - like to have some client-side caching
04:42 - setup as well but probably not gonna get
04:46 - that done today today I think we'll just
04:49 - focus on you know maybe the UI for how
04:55 - these appear and you know possibly
04:57 - getting some categories maybe tags
04:59 - linked up I need to put an image or
05:03 - something up here as well but I'm not
05:06 - worried about that we can just throw in
05:08 - any image for now just to get the idea
05:09 - of what its gonna look like so that's
05:14 - pretty much it I have done made some
05:16 - updates to the new resource section
05:20 - since the last time not a lot but I've
05:23 - just kind of moved code out so I'll take
05:26 - I'll take a second just to show you that
05:31 - I'd have to check out I just checked out
05:33 - the master branch so I don't have it
05:34 - right now so I'll just explain it to you
05:38 - quickly all I did was just take this new
05:42 - it's gonna be hard to explain sorry I
05:45 - might as well just show you so the
05:51 - branch that I'm working on for the new
05:52 - UI is just a new resource UI if you
05:55 - remember I made that last week
06:02 - all right just to show you so anyway I
06:08 - did just a bit okay so basically I I
06:18 - removed a section that was the featured
06:22 - resources it was a big red section so I
06:25 - did this I'm not like under percent sure
06:27 - about this yet but to have this here I
06:32 - still need to initialize the drop down
06:35 - here so there will be a drop down there
06:37 - just move some things around here these
06:40 - are now their own components in a
06:42 - separate file so I added in some data
06:47 - for authors just to give us an idea and
06:49 - then if there is no author data the
06:51 - author doesn't show up so I took a lot
06:53 - of the suggestions that you all had last
06:56 - week and I've incorporated some of them
06:59 - already and there are others that I'm
07:01 - I'm still going to incorporate I didn't
07:04 - have time before the stream today so
07:08 - that's it not really major changes and
07:12 - I'm gonna go back to the master branch
07:15 - now so that we can get started and let
07:23 - me check oops
07:29 - guess I'll have to fix it all right so
07:34 - let me check the live chat really
07:37 - quickly just say hi to everyone while
07:43 - they did a few people here really early
07:45 - kind of seen if anybody's here everyone
07:51 - someone here from India awesome welcome
07:55 - someone from Chile really happy to have
07:59 - you all watching okay
08:08 - Helio says there's some info regarding
08:14 - debounce for the search that's offered
08:19 - in in lodash so off to check that out
08:22 - thank you for that I'll check that out
08:24 - after the after the stream okay
08:32 - Sebastian asked about the date for the
08:34 - post yeah that'll be something that'll
08:36 - need to be added will definitely need
08:39 - with all the normal things that you
08:41 - would expect from you know from a blog
08:44 - will want to put in there with the
08:47 - exception of probably we won't need
08:49 - author because they're you know these
08:52 - are just going to be quick like news
08:53 - announcements and things so they're not
08:56 - gonna be exactly like a normal blog post
08:58 - at least for right now so I think we can
09:01 - leave out the author but other than that
09:03 - will want to have the date Nima des what
09:10 - you - see of course you're doing I'm
09:11 - doing the react course the one that just
09:13 - came out so if anybody else is doing the
09:16 - react course from Udacity then let me
09:19 - know and so far I'm I'm almost done with
09:23 - the first project it's it's the book
09:24 - like a book app if anyone is interested
09:27 - it's on my my github page it it should
09:31 - be you know kind of right at the top I
09:35 - can't remember what I called it but if
09:38 - you want to check out what I'm doing for
09:40 - that cool
09:40 - it is there it's almost finished I
09:43 - haven't done anything with the UI though
09:45 - but in terms of functionality pretty
09:48 - much done I just need to link up react
09:51 - router so that everything has like the
09:56 - forward and back functionality works
10:10 - Oh someone from Norway Hey
10:23 - all right cool so hey everyone I'm gonna
10:28 - get started now I'll try to keep an eye
10:30 - on the chat while I'm going but if you
10:33 - watch before you know how it is
10:34 - sometimes you get into the code maybe a
10:36 - few minutes before I get to check again
10:38 - but at the end I will do I'll answer
10:42 - some questions I need to make sure I end
10:45 - just a heads up I need to end this
10:49 - before 4:00 because my son has my oldest
10:56 - son has karate lessons at 5:00 so I'll
11:01 - probably have to leave around 4 o'clock
11:03 - so maybe 3:30 I'll start wrapping things
11:06 - up eastern time this is all Eastern time
11:09 - so probably do like an hour and a half
11:12 - of coding and then maybe a half hour of
11:14 - question-and-answer so I mean that's
11:17 - that's a decently long stream we'll try
11:19 - to get as much done as we can so I'm
11:23 - starting to feel the pressure a bit we
11:25 - only have till the 20th of this month to
11:28 - get pretty much everything done that's
11:31 - in the Trello board for this project
11:32 - that I have linked up in the description
11:35 - so like everything in these first three
11:39 - columns needs to be done and then
11:43 - potentially anything from this column
11:45 - that I need also needs to be done so
11:47 - it's a lot of stuff so I may be I was
11:52 - hoping I wouldn't have to work extra
11:54 - this week but I might have to
12:01 - it's possible there might be some extra
12:03 - long streams coming they do this week
12:10 - okay if you have if you have someone
12:12 - from Germany someone from South Korea
12:15 - awesome Zanna says ouch that's a lot
12:22 - chance when do you have the time I'm
12:26 - just gonna have to work a lot that's
12:31 - right so I mean my normal work day is
12:33 - like seven hours of work and I'll just
12:36 - have to work a lot more than that and
12:38 - and get it done
12:40 - it's possible some of the things on that
12:42 - list could just wait and you know maybe
12:46 - they're not absolutely necessary so off
12:49 - I'll go through the list later in the
12:51 - week and really make sure that
12:52 - everything on there is absolutely
12:54 - necessary but otherwise to just I have
12:59 - to get it I have to get it done and they
13:03 - I'm gonna move on to another project
13:04 - after that so in like two weeks we'll be
13:07 - we'll be working on something different
13:09 - in you know for the streams so let me
13:13 - get out of these are the resources oh no
13:17 - this isn't it so I did switch over I
13:20 - prepared a little bit today for the
13:22 - stream I got got this up so as you can
13:26 - see like like I said this is all
13:28 - hard-coded so we're gonna have to pull
13:32 - this in and populate these lists from
13:36 - from the API this mate instead of being
13:40 - a list this may end up being a drop-down
13:42 - because if there's a lot of categories I
13:44 - don't want a giant list of categories
13:47 - the tags I might end up making this like
13:51 - you know like you know you see like the
13:53 - tag cloud where the tags that are used
13:59 - most often or bigger I think that would
14:03 - be kind of cool
14:04 - so maybe y'all when you get the data
14:08 - from the API it tells you how many times
14:11 - the tag has been used so if we link that
14:14 - piece of data up to the font size then
14:18 - we should be able to make it so each tag
14:22 - the tag font size for each tag is based
14:26 - on the number of times that tag is used
14:28 - will obviously have you know lower limit
14:30 - at an upper limit so the font stays
14:32 - readable at the lower end and it's not
14:35 - too big on the higher end but I think
14:36 - that would be a cool feature not
14:39 - necessary though that might be one of
14:41 - the things that only happens if we have
14:42 - time and probably won't get to this
14:47 - today in terms of you know the dates
14:50 - also that you know the dates are not
14:53 - going to be necessary at first anyway
14:56 - there's just not gonna be enough enough
14:59 - posts to really warrant really any of
15:02 - these these things are necessary at
15:04 - first because there's only gonna be a
15:06 - few posts but what will work if we can
15:10 - so first things first let's get some of
15:13 - those normal blog things in the display
15:17 - and we'll probably want to take this out
15:20 - and make it its own component we're
15:24 - gonna add stuff it's gonna start to get
15:26 - bigger better just to move it out of
15:27 - here
15:28 - so why don't we do that first so I'm
15:32 - gonna go in case you're not that
15:35 - familiar with the command line I'm gonna
15:37 - switch over to the command line and
15:46 - I'm gonna go type in touch and then
15:52 - components all right so if you're on the
15:55 - command line and you want to create a
15:56 - new file you use the command touch this
16:01 - is on a Mac and I haven't used a command
16:04 - line on a PC and so long I can't
16:06 - remember which commands are the same or
16:08 - not so possible that the commands I'm
16:10 - using here won't work but but just in
16:13 - case that you're kind of new with the
16:15 - command line this is how you create a
16:16 - file and I'm gonna make it in the
16:18 - components folder so right now I'm in
16:20 - the the just the base folder for this
16:22 - project I need to go into the components
16:24 - folder and inside that folder I want to
16:26 - make a new component called blog j/s so
16:33 - now if I go back over to the project you
16:37 - see see if I can zoom I never figured
16:45 - out there we go
16:49 - all right I'll zoom in here so you can
16:52 - see stuff in in my editor at least stuff
16:56 - in green is are things that have been
16:58 - added that are new so now we've just
16:59 - added this blog j/s file all right so it
17:04 - might seem like why would I want to type
17:06 - that out when I could have just gone
17:08 - here and said you know give me a new new
17:11 - file and I could have just done it there
17:13 - after a while and you start using the
17:16 - command line it actually ends up being
17:19 - faster to just do more through the
17:21 - command line so if you're new to it
17:24 - probably nothing is faster than the
17:26 - command line right now but if you get
17:28 - used to it it's way faster than any
17:30 - graphical interface for a lot of things
17:32 - I even do image editing through the
17:34 - command line now and I prefer that to
17:36 - any type of graphical editing so anyway
17:40 - enough enough of that but I like to go
17:42 - into some of those little details
17:43 - occasionally because if people of all
17:45 - skill levels watching so don't want to
17:49 - leave people behind with something that
17:51 - it's simple to me now because I've been
17:54 - using it for so long but I remember when
17:55 - I first started like anything on the
17:57 - command
17:58 - it's just like a mystery to me and
18:01 - everybody on YouTube that was just
18:03 - flying through commands like it just
18:05 - seems so awesome so we're gonna make
18:09 - this a component and I'd like to make
18:11 - this a stateless functional component so
18:13 - I haven't done this yet on any of the
18:16 - any of the streams but basically it's
18:23 - it's a kind of a slightly shorter way to
18:26 - make a component then what we have been
18:29 - using and you can't use it all the time
18:32 - but if you have a component like this
18:35 - where it's basically not doing much at
18:38 - all i mean it it's just gonna take some
18:40 - props and display it and that's about it
18:43 - nothing else is really gonna be
18:44 - happening oops I thought I had the news
18:48 - thing up oh well so but first thing
18:50 - we're gonna do is import react from let
18:56 - me double check it from react okay
19:00 - that's what I thought it was these stuff
19:03 - in the top I never type out I'm always
19:05 - just copy and pasting it so I have to
19:08 - double check what I'm using it so now
19:10 - we're gonna say Const and we're gonna
19:13 - call this blog equals and let me I'm
19:24 - actually gonna double check I'm gonna
19:26 - bring up on my other screen my project
19:29 - do I have it here there we go this is
19:39 - from my project for the Udacity course
19:41 - I'm gonna put on the other screen so
19:42 - this is where I learned this stuff from
19:44 - the course so it's I'm trying to use
19:46 - what I'm learning immediately so don't
19:48 - forget it so I'm gonna bring it up on
19:49 - the screen so I get all the syntax right
19:51 - because I don't want to waste your time
19:52 - with me messing up the syntax trying to
19:57 - seem like I know this stuff by heart
20:00 - when I really don't alright so basically
20:06 - this is it we just have to export
20:16 - and that's it that's all we need so let
20:20 - me compare this to another kind of
20:24 - similar component so let's check out
20:26 - like this resource card so basically
20:29 - doing the same thing there they're just
20:30 - taking in some props and displaying it
20:33 - now of course the resource cards has a
20:36 - bit more here but look at what we have
20:39 - so the import is slightly different
20:42 - because we're important component but up
20:43 - here you know we believe make a class
20:45 - right and then we have this render
20:48 - function and then we have to say with
20:50 - the return within there okay and then we
20:53 - export so basically we're getting rid of
20:55 - the render and the return this is
20:59 - slightly shorter this line is get rid of
21:02 - a few brackets and then we end up having
21:05 - something that's a lot a lot cleaner
21:09 - looking so not really like a really huge
21:13 - difference but it looks a bit nicer also
21:18 - you all show you in a second the way we
21:21 - call on these props is slightly
21:23 - different than what we do so we'll say
21:26 - like this props you don't need this
21:29 - anymore within here you can just say
21:31 - props so that's the only that's really
21:34 - the only big difference in terms of what
21:37 - you're going to do within within here
21:40 - all right so let's bring this I lost my
21:45 - news page here it is so let's bring the
21:49 - news here we go
21:57 - that's actually weird this is I
21:58 - highlighted this div and it's giving me
22:01 - it's I think I messed that up and never
22:07 - knew about it so I did i made this weeks
22:10 - ago but it seems like I need to have
22:13 - another another div inside of here right
22:21 - oh I know what happened
22:24 - okay this still works actually I
22:27 - remember thinking the same thing now
22:29 - weeks ago so I'm just closing this div
22:32 - since it's I'm just gonna make a div
22:36 - here and then that way it won't keep
22:38 - tricking my editor and in a week I won't
22:42 - forget again and have it confuse me okay
22:46 - so let's just copy this and I can get
22:51 - rid of get rid of it because we're gonna
22:57 - pull it in as a component and we need to
23:08 - slug title when you make sure we pull in
23:12 - the same props that it needs so we need
23:14 - to get the slug we need to pull in a
23:16 - title we need the content also we're
23:19 - gonna need to pull in the date and
23:24 - obviously I don't remember what the date
23:26 - format is and so we'll probably have to
23:29 - do something with the format of the date
23:31 - to make it more presentable but for now
23:36 - it was a day we need the slug title and
23:40 - content alright so here we're going to
23:45 - bring in his component blog and then
23:49 - we're gonna pass in the props that we
23:52 - had before to let me since we're gonna
23:55 - be working on both of these
23:57 - let's move this blog component over here
24:00 - so we can see them side by side let me
24:03 - know if this font is too small
24:05 - I'll make sure I'll check back in like
24:08 - 30 seconds in the live chat
24:10 - if it's too small for you I can
24:13 - definitely I can make it bigger it's
24:14 - it's comfortable right now for me but if
24:18 - it's too small for you I can definitely
24:20 - make it bigger so let's bring in slug
24:34 - slug and we need a title title rendered
24:44 - oops I got the equal sign and if you're
24:51 - not familiar with react and a lot of
24:52 - this is over your head I apologize in
24:54 - previous videos I have taken a little
24:57 - bit more time to explain this so if you
25:01 - if you want to watch me explain it you
25:03 - can kind of check out some of the titles
25:04 - of the videos and titles that would talk
25:06 - about specifically about react
25:08 - components will probably have the best
25:10 - explanation but I don't really think
25:12 - that my videos are the best to get kind
25:14 - of a tutorial so you might want to you
25:17 - know check out the docs and for react or
25:20 - check out some other videos or courses
25:23 - on react to get a better idea of what's
25:28 - kind of going on here I'll do my best to
25:29 - explain it so right now we are passing
25:33 - in what are called props so that this
25:37 - component here can use all the data that
25:40 - we're pulling in in this component this
25:43 - we're going to pass on that data through
25:46 - props it's the last one we need is
25:53 - content right yeah
26:11 - we always want to make sure we close it
26:13 - so all the HTML like tags in react when
26:19 - you're using JSX
26:20 - have to be closed you'll get an error
26:25 - otherwise so make sure you you're
26:27 - closing everything and that looks good
26:31 - we we do need to make sure that we're
26:33 - importing this because right now this
26:35 - component will have no idea what we're
26:37 - talking about because we haven't
26:39 - imported it so let's go up here and
26:41 - we're gonna import actually I'm just
26:46 - gonna copy this paste it and change this
26:51 - to the log oops so now it's importing
26:58 - the component blog from the folder
27:01 - components blog you don't have to put
27:05 - the dot je s at the end it knows that
27:08 - all these are going to be JavaScript
27:09 - files so now what should happen is when
27:15 - I save this I'll actually want em so we
27:19 - didn't change anything over here but
27:21 - when I change this to reflect these
27:24 - names of these props it should
27:26 - everything should look exactly the same
27:28 - as it did before so I just need to to
27:31 - change this and instead of post it's
27:39 - gonna be props so props slug and
27:52 - and then also we don't need rendered
27:57 - right since we're bringing in
28:01 - we're already bringing in the rendered
28:04 - version of this content and this this is
28:08 - not like some special command this is
28:10 - just the way the JSON file is formatted
28:12 - that comes from WordPress okay so now
28:17 - I'll save this file and I'll save this
28:19 - file and let's check out and see what
28:22 - the site looks like yay it still looks
28:25 - the same
28:26 - so I'll refresh just to be sure usually
28:30 - we get a you know an instant refresh
28:35 - actually good thing I refreshed it looks
28:38 - like my dev server is up here just click
28:44 - my dev server has quit working once
28:47 - again
29:04 - hmm I is not defined uh-oh looks like I
29:08 - forgot something
29:09 - oh the key okay so I was bringing in a
29:15 - key and it was just an iterator so I
29:23 - need to pass that in I forgot about that
29:27 - so let's pass in the key and this will
29:30 - be I and then here it should work we'll
29:38 - just need to put it in drops dot I so in
29:44 - react if you're going to be you know
29:47 - iterating over components and rendering
29:50 - the same component over and over again
29:51 - each one has to have a unique key it
29:55 - doesn't have to be unique to your whole
29:56 - react application but has to be unique
29:58 - among those sibling components so in
30:02 - this case you know it's just the the
30:06 - iterator so it's just gonna be like 0 1
30:07 - 2 3 4 all right but we could each each
30:11 - of these posts will have their own ID
30:13 - that's been given to it from WordPress
30:16 - so we could use that if we needed to but
30:18 - we don't really need to need that so
30:22 - since we wouldn't I would normally pull
30:24 - in the wordpress ID of something if i
30:26 - was only gonna use it for the key but if
30:29 - i needed it for something else then i
30:31 - probably just use it for the key - all
30:36 - right so now it works so now we can see
30:38 - we have this and just to kind of show
30:43 - you in dev tools react so if you are
30:50 - doing anything with react I highly
30:52 - recommend getting the react extension
30:56 - for dev tools I have no idea how I
30:59 - initially got this it's been too long so
31:01 - I can't remember but I'm sure I know it
31:05 - wasn't difficult to load up on here so
31:09 - let's see news first here we go so we
31:15 - have blog just to show you the name
31:18 - of the component now as it is using the
31:21 - blog component and you can see we have
31:24 - these props are being passed so this is
31:26 - the content being passed we have this
31:28 - love the title so it's working exactly
31:34 - how we wanted to I'm gonna check the
31:41 - live chat since it's been quite a while
31:44 - since I checked it Wow everyone in the
31:50 - live chat has been busy this is this
31:53 - huge since there's so much activity the
31:56 - live chat I'll say it right now if you
31:58 - ask a question early on and I don't get
32:00 - to it there's a chance that I might not
32:03 - ever see it because when the chat gets
32:06 - really big the stuff that the comments
32:09 - that came earliest I can't read them
32:11 - anymore they're just gone
32:13 - so if I do miss your question and you
32:16 - stick around for the Q&A at the end you
32:18 - can just ask it again or you can put it
32:21 - in the comments to this video or you can
32:24 - message me on Twitter and I'll answer it
32:27 - I'll answer it then okay so I scrolled
32:32 - back up to the last place I looked
32:34 - oh yes people from Austria Romania
32:45 - Albania awesome
32:52 - Venezuela that's awesome I love hearing
32:56 - where where you all are from I think
32:58 - it's a really fun that it's really fun
33:01 - that so many people from all over the
33:03 - world in different time zones are all
33:04 - coming together and you know there's
33:09 - just so much nice interaction the live
33:11 - chat you all helped me out a lot it's
33:13 - just really cool
33:22 - oh there is some talk in the live chat
33:24 - about the the link to my Udacity project
33:29 - yeah and I didn't even think about it
33:31 - but yeah so this project this react CI
33:34 - is underneath FUS marcom so it's
33:40 - Franciscan University of student ville
33:42 - marketing department my page let me go
33:47 - to my profile what's mine mine is Jessie
33:54 - our Weigel so what I'm talking about is
34:01 - this one this my read starter project so
34:11 - sorry about that I totally forgot that I
34:13 - had had the other project under a
34:16 - different no what do they call one I
34:19 - can't remember organization is how they
34:22 - call it an organization account anyway
34:25 - yes I haven't even changed the readme or
34:28 - anything yet I just I just was like
34:31 - trying to focus and work through and get
34:33 - all the functionality down before I mess
34:35 - with anything else because it's so easy
34:37 - to get caught up in the the UI and you
34:41 - know trying to make the reaming
34:42 - everything that I thought this is gonna
34:44 - take me forever I just want to make sure
34:46 - I get it done alright okay cool and
34:53 - Sebastian had already put in the live
34:55 - chat the the link that I just showed you
34:58 - so I should have just scrolled down a
35:00 - bit as Anna said could you sometimes
35:06 - just film your editor while you code
35:08 - without being distracted by talking to
35:10 - us I would look at that I mean if you
35:13 - don't have the time for talking okay
35:17 - I never thought about doing that I
35:19 - always figured that would be boring but
35:22 - yeah I love to think about that so yeah
35:26 - let me know what you all think the
35:27 - suggestion was I made I don't have time
35:33 - and it's true like I don't have I
35:35 - couldn't
35:35 - do this all day because it does take
35:39 - extra time to do the talking and things
35:41 - I think it's it's really valuable for me
35:44 - because I get so many great ideas but it
35:47 - does it slows things down a bit so
35:49 - there's a lot of things that need done
35:52 - that I know how to do it it just it
35:53 - needs to get done and they're not really
35:55 - you know fun to watch I would I would
35:58 - say so I don't record them but maybe if
36:02 - you all would be interested in seeing
36:04 - some recordings which are basically me
36:06 - just working not talking I might be
36:11 - interested in that I don't know that I
36:14 - would take up the free code camp channel
36:16 - with all that all day in case you know
36:19 - occasionally there are some I know
36:20 - Quincy does some live interview
36:22 - sometimes so I wouldn't want to be a you
36:24 - know on all the time so I'd either do it
36:26 - either like on my channel my youtube
36:29 - channel or maybe I'd get like a twitch
36:31 - channel or something to do that sort of
36:34 - thing but I'm I'm open for that if you
36:38 - alright I get I would kind of feel bad
36:40 - not talking to anybody but I guess if
36:43 - you're interested I would I'd be fine
36:45 - with that
36:50 - vim Rossi asks is there any difference
36:53 - in commands for Ubuntu or Mac I don't
36:59 - really I've never come across any
37:01 - difference not not to say that there
37:03 - aren't any differences maybe there are I
37:05 - but I have personally never seen any
37:07 - difference between Mac and Linux
37:10 - commands
37:17 - okay wrote Rohan is getting deep on me
37:20 - here and say saying you are using a PC
37:23 - you aren't using Windows says even
37:26 - modern Mac's our pcs technically
37:29 - technically all Macs are IBM
37:32 - pc-compatible so yes so good distinction
37:36 - roll on so on Windows the commands are
37:40 - different yeah let's not vim Brasi says
37:50 - don't start Mac versus windows here yeah
37:52 - I didn't mean to start I mean I don't
37:53 - care if in the live chat you have
37:55 - discussions about you know whatever as
37:57 - long as it's you know not not being mean
38:00 - to anybody I guess but yeah I don't mean
38:03 - to argue I own several PCs and a Mac and
38:10 - I have a Chromebook and I run I don't
38:14 - have a Linux you know computer that I
38:16 - use but I use Linux on my servers so so
38:21 - I can see the benefits and all of them
38:23 - they all have good things about them
38:28 - although anymore the only thing that I
38:30 - use Windows for really is for gaming and
38:34 - I don't really have that much time for
38:36 - gaming now at all I'd probably been
38:38 - months since I've played a computer game
38:40 - you know on a Windows computer
38:55 - okay Andrew R asks about the Udacity
39:00 - course link yeah I guess I can post it
39:07 - do you mean specify first do you mean
39:12 - the link to like sign up and register
39:15 - for the course or are you talking about
39:17 - the link to my project for the course if
39:22 - it's the link to my project it already
39:24 - has been put in the chat by Sebastian a
39:27 - little bit higher up in the chat if it's
39:29 - the link to the Udacity course I could
39:31 - give you a link but I think they're
39:33 - really pushing the course a lot right
39:35 - now so I think the homepage for Udacity
39:37 - would you just be Udacity calm I'm
39:38 - pretty sure that they have it on the
39:40 - homepage at least they did at one point
39:51 - I know there's discussion there's always
39:53 - a discussion about the editor always us
39:57 - I wonder how long you can keep it going
40:01 - that like there's gonna be discussing
40:04 - about the editor and every single every
40:07 - single time I stream which is cool I'm
40:10 - not gonna get into the discussion I just
40:12 - noted somebody did ask about whether it
40:15 - was still slow i I think the Adam editor
40:19 - to me at least to seem like it has
40:21 - gotten faster than it was it's still not
40:24 - as fast like Visual Studio code seems
40:26 - faster to me it's possible that's just
40:29 - because I have a lot more plugin it's
40:31 - going for Adam but in general vs code
40:34 - seems faster but Adam seems way faster
40:37 - than it did when I first got it which
40:40 - was a few years ago I think I started
40:43 - using Adam like when it when it first
40:45 - came out really close to it so it was
40:51 - quite slow at one time
41:01 - adhi I'm not sure how to pronounce it's
41:04 - a Adi says am I the only new beer you're
41:06 - not the only new beer I - I'm a new
41:12 - Santa says we're all react noobs that's
41:16 - why we're here some are more advanced
41:17 - yeah ok I'll I'll make sure I'd try to
41:25 - do a better job of explaining things for
41:28 - those who are not familiar with react
41:30 - and it looks like there's some good
41:32 - explanation going on in a live chat as
41:34 - well so thank you all for for taking the
41:37 - time to explain that to the people who
41:39 - aren't familiar with it oh cool Zanna it
41:45 - said she finished the code academy code
41:48 - academy react course react 1 awesome I
41:52 - went through those when they first came
41:54 - out I don't know if they have more I
41:56 - want to check again to see if they've
41:58 - added on to the course or anything if
42:00 - there's more to do but I remember it
42:01 - being pretty helpful unfortunately after
42:04 - I took that course I didn't have a
42:06 - project that I was doing in react so I
42:08 - forgot most of what I had learned in
42:10 - that course but I think it all kind of
42:13 - sticks around in long-term memory so
42:15 - it's the next time I tried to learn it I
42:17 - get caught on quicker ok
42:26 - almost almost through with the with the
42:29 - live chat I got to try to look back more
42:32 - frequently so I don't have these giant
42:33 - periods where I'm taking a break from
42:36 - coding I think it just might be better
42:39 - for those of you watching it's possible
42:44 - there are some people that don't really
42:45 - care about the latch and just want to
42:46 - see the code
43:07 - Mohammed Khan ass is it worth doing the
43:10 - Codecademy course for me I think it was
43:14 - worth it it's somewhat depends on how
43:17 - advanced you are with react and how you
43:20 - like to learn best I found it to be I
43:24 - find most of the codecademy things to be
43:26 - like a lot of like really I can holding
43:28 - step by step and I often don't know
43:30 - enough at the end to really do a project
43:32 - on my own but it helps me to get that
43:34 - little bit of confidence and knowledge
43:36 - of things without having to commit to
43:38 - like setting up my own development
43:40 - environment for it and everything so I
43:42 - think it's worthwhile it might slightly
43:47 - be a waste of time if you're you know
43:49 - more than just the beginner at react you
43:52 - may pick up a few things but it might
43:55 - not really be worth it if you already
43:58 - know a bit so but I I thought when I did
44:02 - it that it was worthwhile but I was
44:04 - really really new at react to the point
44:06 - where like I I knew you know almost
44:09 - nothing I had just seen some people use
44:11 - it at a conference and knew enough to
44:14 - knew that I wanted to know more but that
44:16 - was it
44:31 - okay all right looks like Jax's doesn't
44:35 - mind listening to the the to the chat me
44:38 - revisiting the chat so okay cool
44:46 - alright she also have some people
44:48 - talking about the best training courses
44:51 - for react so someone mentioned free
44:55 - cocaine yeah free code camp is good to
44:57 - learn your basic JavaScript I haven't
45:00 - checked out the new free code camp so
45:02 - there's a beta version of free code camp
45:04 - that I think does go and more it does a
45:09 - lot more with react I haven't looked at
45:12 - the beta version for a really long time
45:16 - like months and months so I don't know I
45:19 - can't speak personally about what it's
45:20 - what it's like but I'm pretty sure it
45:23 - has some stuff for reacting you can
45:24 - check out the beta stuff now so if you
45:28 - like free code camp you can check out
45:30 - the react stuff from free code camp
45:39 - alright so let me go back now I've
45:42 - gotten through a lot of the live chat I
45:43 - skipped over some stuff I'll come back
45:45 - later on and really look through it but
45:48 - I think I got the important questions
45:50 - when I go back to the live chat really
45:52 - what I want to do is make sure anybody
45:54 - especially who's new that I make sure I
45:57 - address the questions because I know you
46:00 - know those of you who watch for a long
46:01 - time I'm sure you're okay if I miss
46:04 - something at some point and but I don't
46:07 - want new people to feel ignored
46:08 - especially if they're know not only new
46:11 - to this channel but you know they're
46:13 - also new to coding so I want to make
46:16 - sure that everybody's everybody is
46:19 - addressed you know at least at some
46:21 - point especially if I see something like
46:23 - a new person that I haven't haven't seen
46:26 - before in the live chat so hey or
46:29 - somebody joining in IT engineer join in
46:32 - so hey thanks for watching
46:40 - breakpoint recommends the official react
46:42 - tutorial so yeah check that out I can't
46:46 - believe I forgot to mention that yeah
46:47 - the react like the react.js website has
46:51 - a tutorial to go through so that would
46:55 - also be cool dealing for that is you you
46:59 - do set up your development environment
47:01 - on your own computer from there so if
47:03 - you're not comfortable with that part of
47:05 - it then maybe you'd want to do something
47:07 - that's more in browser like Codecademy
47:10 - free code camp stuff browser-based first
47:12 - to get you comfortable but if you're
47:15 - already comfortable setting up a dev
47:16 - environment then yeah the react course
47:19 - the react to toriel is is great ok one
47:30 - more from the live set before we get
47:31 - started so vim Rossi says I'm 30 years
47:33 - old
47:34 - Nubian web development D recruiters have
47:37 - age bias when hiring I don't know that I
47:42 - actually I'm not sure that I can answer
47:44 - that
47:45 - you know accurately from what I have
47:49 - heard there's a lot of people in the
47:51 - free code camp forum and also on medium
47:54 - the do blog posts and talk about their
47:55 - experience getting hired and almost
47:58 - everybody that I read about getting
48:01 - hired is older than 30
48:04 - it's just especially lately it seems
48:07 - like everyone that's writing about being
48:09 - able to get a job is older than 30 so it
48:12 - seems like maybe there's maybe there's
48:15 - not they're getting a job but that's
48:16 - entirely you know anecdotal I don't have
48:18 - any data to back up anything like that
48:21 - but it looks like I'm 31 right now I got
48:25 - hired something I was like 28 or 29 when
48:29 - I got hired so not you know right around
48:33 - 30 so at least for me I was able to get
48:37 - hired and I hope that there's not a lot
48:42 - of age bias because if I want to if I
48:45 - ever want to switch and get a job
48:47 - somewhere else I'm definitely gonna be
48:48 - older then
48:50 - am now so I'll probably you know be
48:52 - older than 30 for sure so anyway I don't
48:56 - really know maybe if someone else has
48:58 - some some better insight into the world
49:03 - of recruiters you could you know kind of
49:06 - contribute there in the live chat all
49:15 - right so let's let's go back actually
49:20 - just reminded me my my dad told me
49:23 - yesterday that he's gonna retire in
49:25 - September the end of September
49:27 - I think he's 57 now and I told him I was
49:33 - asking him what he's gonna do any
49:34 - retires and I said you wanna learn how
49:35 - to be a developer I said I could teach
49:38 - you how to do stuff and so he said his
49:41 - you know he's 57 and he's gonna I don't
49:44 - think he's gonna really learn how to be
49:46 - a developer but I'll try I'll try to see
49:48 - if you know even if he doesn't want to
49:52 - get a job as a developer he'd be cool to
49:53 - be able to talk about the stuff with my
49:55 - dad but I really think he could I told
49:59 - him he'd get a lot of publicity if he
50:01 - published his journey to becoming a
50:02 - developer after a retiring I think that
50:06 - would be a cool story I told him I tell
50:09 - everybody on Twitter about it if he did
50:10 - do it but all right
50:15 - okay I had a reminder for a meeting so
50:17 - normally on Mondays I have this meeting
50:18 - at 3:00 p.m. but today my department
50:23 - head came in and asked for the data that
50:25 - I was supposed to give in the meeting
50:27 - and I had already put it into a
50:30 - spreadsheet and it was already raised
50:32 - she said okay you don't have to come to
50:34 - the meeting which is awesome because I
50:36 - need all the time I can get for this
50:37 - project and that means I get to do a
50:39 - longer stream which which is really
50:42 - great I was actually kind of in a kind
50:46 - of a down mood all day until I started
50:48 - the stream so thank you everyone for
50:52 - helping improve my my mood just had some
50:58 - some bad stuff happen in my in my family
51:01 - this weekend so I was just kind of
51:03 - about that but let's get back to this
51:07 - let's go let's put in a date so let's
51:10 - see what format we're gonna get when we
51:12 - try to pull this date in and we'll try
51:15 - to reformat it in a way that's a little
51:18 - bit easier to read if we need to if I
51:27 - want to switch this order right now cuz
51:30 - it'll keep bothering me so I'd like to
51:32 - keep the code in the middle so I can
51:34 - just quickly kind of move move the
51:36 - screens
51:46 - okay so we're gonna be working first we
51:49 - need to pull in the dates
51:52 - okay so right now we are just getting
51:55 - posts and I'm pulling in all everything
51:57 - so we should be able to bring in the
51:58 - date I'm gonna check the kind of the raw
52:03 - API data and so we can check out what we
52:10 - have to work with and I'll bring it over
52:13 - here on this screen so y'all can see it
52:16 - as well all right so this is all the
52:18 - data that we have to work with right now
52:19 - when we get we pull in posts so it looks
52:24 - like we have so we have a date and this
52:27 - is the date format so we definitely need
52:30 - to change this format
52:39 - quickly I'm just gonna kind of look
52:41 - through and see if there's any other
52:42 - data that we probably should be putting
52:44 - in there
52:51 - Oh actually I'm wondering if I should
52:57 - pull in any any images into this view I
53:03 - don't think I'm going to right now just
53:06 - because I have such a short amount of
53:09 - time to get this all done I I think I
53:13 - kind of like well I mean the way it
53:16 - looks right now listen great but I can
53:17 - see what it will end up looking like
53:20 - kind of in my mind and I think I like it
53:22 - without the images we'll see if I need
53:27 - to put in the images later on I will
53:30 - when for certainly when people click to
53:34 - go and you know when a user clicks and
53:36 - goes into the main you know single post
53:38 - page and images can be there but on this
53:41 - page I think it might be nice to not
53:44 - have them oh we are gonna need the
53:50 - categories yeah we need to bring in
53:55 - categories because we want to set up
54:01 - some filters before when people click on
54:05 - these different categories so normally
54:11 - in a blog setup like if this were just a
54:14 - wordpress blog you'd click on a category
54:17 - and there'd actually be an entire page
54:19 - for those categories I don't think
54:23 - that's necessary for this that does give
54:26 - the advantage of having an actual link
54:29 - someone could go to but it's it's really
54:33 - rare that you could share a link to a
54:36 - category page on a blog so I think I
54:40 - mean you can let me know I just I never
54:43 - bookmark or share links to category
54:46 - pages on blogs so maybe maybe people do
54:49 - and I'm just not aware of it I just
54:54 - glanced back at the latest comment from
55:01 - Elaine I'm sorry I really didn't feel
55:04 - bad if I mess up your name
55:06 - it's al AI n says I have no idea that
55:10 - you can react in WordPress so yes I mean
55:15 - technically it's not a wordpress site
55:17 - I'm just pulling in data from a
55:19 - wordpress site that's on a different
55:21 - server but you could actually use react
55:27 - like within a wordpress theme I've never
55:31 - done it I've seen I've seen some stuff
55:35 - on github of people doing it and I'm
55:39 - pretty sure they've done it successfully
55:42 - but I've never tried to do it I always
55:44 - just thought you know if I'm gonna use
55:48 - react I'm gonna do you know an entirely
55:51 - separate react site but maybe there are
55:54 - some advantages to doing it you know
55:56 - more like the traditional WordPress
55:58 - theme route I'm just not really aware of
56:01 - them okay we need to make sure we we
56:09 - pull an announcement I don't think we're
56:13 - going to need to mess with us right now
56:14 - so basically the there are two types
56:19 - they're going to be news and there's
56:20 - gonna be announcements I'm not entirely
56:22 - sure what the difference is between news
56:24 - and announcements it doesn't really
56:25 - matter for what I'm doing though because
56:27 - I'm not gonna be entering in content but
56:30 - it's possible that we could do we would
56:32 - want to put tabs for news and
56:34 - announcement but I don't think so I
56:36 - think it'd be fine to just put things
56:39 - you know right just right in order on
56:43 - the home page they will be separated
56:45 - from news and announcements so I'm not
56:49 - I'm not too worried about it and I'm not
56:50 - sure that a user coming to the site
56:53 - would know all right well what's the
56:56 - news with falls under news what falls
56:58 - under announcements I don't know that it
56:59 - would actually be useful to anyone to be
57:03 - able to filter by news and announcements
57:04 - these categories are gonna be better and
57:07 - then we will probably put in a search
57:09 - function somewhere and that will be more
57:14 - okay sorry I'm just doing a lot of
57:17 - thinking out loud here and not a lot of
57:19 - coding but I guess it's better to do
57:23 - this first than to have to code
57:26 - everything over and over again because
57:30 - of changing my mind halfway through okay
57:33 - so I think we're we're good let's pull
57:36 - in the date we'll just stick is one step
57:40 - at a time I feel like I just planned out
57:41 - everything for this page all at once and
57:46 - we haven't gotten much done so let's
57:49 - pull in the date first and then let's
57:51 - convert this date this was actually be
57:53 - cool to do because dates always drive me
57:56 - crazy
57:57 - I've successfully worked with them and
58:00 - displayed them before but I always
58:02 - forget how I did it so I'll have to look
58:04 - up some previous projects because I'm
58:07 - pretty sure on a previous site I took a
58:08 - date in that exact same format from
58:10 - WordPress and then displayed it in a
58:14 - more user friendly way I think I did off
58:18 - the double check all right so let's pull
58:24 - in first we're gonna pass in the date
58:27 - like if you remember we're getting the
58:29 - data from WordPress the WordPress API
58:31 - here and the news component and this
58:34 - news component is our entire news page
58:37 - and then we're grabbing the data here
58:39 - and then we're passing that data to our
58:42 - blog component and we're passing it as a
58:50 - prop or as you know multiple props so
58:54 - let's go date and we're gonna say post
58:59 - date so now we're gonna pass that in
59:04 - will now have access to date here within
59:07 - our blog component so we're gonna put
59:14 - the date let me look quickly maybe the
59:16 - date could go right underneath the title
59:20 - we'll see how that looks really I mean
59:23 - it's gonna go either above the time
59:26 - below the title probably the best places
59:28 - to put it
59:29 - so we'll try below first here's our
59:34 - title it's an h2 and it is it's wrapped
59:38 - in a link tag let's make this we just
59:43 - put into this a span and we're
59:49 - definitely gonna style it so that it's
59:52 - it shows up but for now we'll just put
59:54 - it in here as from date
60:07 - okay so this is just the test to make
60:10 - sure we've imported it properly it's
60:12 - obviously gonna look there you go like
60:14 - this alright so first things first let's
60:17 - get this reformat it we are also going
60:19 - to want to move it up a bit I don't mind
60:22 - the size it's kind of small but I'm fine
60:24 - with that because I don't really want
60:25 - the date to be the focus so I'd like it
60:29 - to be smaller than the title and the
60:32 - excerpt but I would like to move it up
60:35 - so that it sits right under here so
60:37 - we'll probably a lot of this this
60:41 - padding is more this is probably because
60:43 - of the H text we'll probably need to set
60:45 - some styles on this H tag to bring this
60:48 - up but first let's get this date going
60:51 - so first thing I'm going to do is check
60:55 - out a project where I use this
60:58 - previously actually I can go here it's
61:02 - already open I did a project this is a
61:06 - private repository right now so
61:08 - unfortunately you won't be able to check
61:09 - it out it's got to be private because
61:16 - the entire website is private well I
61:24 - thought it was I thought I had worked on
61:27 - it
61:27 - there is so actually this is an
61:32 - interesting phrase I could show this
61:34 - project more maybe with I redo it one
61:38 - day I'll convert it to react but this is
61:41 - the same concept I'm pulling data from
61:43 - the WordPress API but instead of doing
61:46 - it with react
61:47 - I made the entire UI and all the
61:49 - interactions and everything with jQuery
61:52 - so I really wish I could show you just
61:56 - like how insane the code is even the
61:59 - routing so like the URLs all work each
62:04 - post has its own URL every time you do a
62:08 - search it has its own URL every category
62:12 - everything so it's insane and the readme
62:17 - is somewhat unrelated because once I set
62:20 - it to private
62:20 - I just didn't care about the readme
62:22 - anymore but anyway let's let me go
62:37 - yeah I think let me move this over
62:44 - quickly
62:50 - I don't think I have anything in this
62:51 - code that I shouldn't show but just in
62:54 - case okay I do have some stuff about the
62:59 - date here no no but I don't think I
63:04 - actually displayed to the user so I
63:07 - thought I did I thought this is going to
63:08 - be easy and I could just copy and paste
63:10 - some code from a previous site but I
63:15 - don't think it's gonna be that easy
63:16 - it was worth a shot though oh wait a
63:21 - second no I did display it awesome I
63:26 - just have to find where I display it
63:51 - alright let me bring this back over just
63:53 - to show you a bit of the the craziness
63:56 - of this code I don't recommend doing
63:59 - this ever because as you'll see now like
64:03 - trying to go back through this code and
64:05 - figure out what is going on even though
64:06 - I made it all it's just crazy
64:10 - so you see this is just like a really
64:17 - really long file of JavaScript so like
64:23 - if you ever hear people like warn you
64:25 - which I always heard the warnings like
64:27 - you know you don't want to do this and
64:29 - all jQuery you end up with spaghetti
64:31 - code it'll be unmaintainable like I
64:33 - always heard the warnings but I never
64:35 - really saw it like but it does really
64:38 - happen all right so let me I need to
64:49 - find my temp so at some point I have
64:51 - like templates in here so I didn't use a
64:53 - templating library I just use template
64:56 - literals like the es6 template literals
65:00 - to make templates do you see this this
65:07 - whole thing is using I'm pretty sure I
65:12 - use like too here we go here's one part
65:16 - of the template so I was using source
65:17 - set to serve like different size images
65:21 - but I had to first check to make sure
65:24 - that that post actually had an image of
65:26 - that size before I did anything so I end
65:29 - up with lots of stuff like this here we
65:35 - go I know somewhere in here I have the
65:40 - dates
65:54 - you should be alright so I have the
65:57 - category tags and
66:11 - now I can't find it
66:17 - maybe it's down here so I let me know if
66:21 - this is really boring you going through
66:22 - this this really kind of badly written
66:26 - code
66:27 - I'll check the live chat in a second and
66:29 - if if you all don't want to see it I'll
66:31 - quit but um I think I'm really close to
66:37 - finding the point at which I have the
66:40 - date this day any day for this to be
66:43 - done okay I got some date stuff going on
66:49 - yes here it is
66:51 - alright so we're showing a title and
66:55 - then this dates okay
67:10 - all right cool this is gonna be very
67:12 - useful all right so here's what I did so
67:15 - I took the date and I made it I set it
67:19 - to a variable and I've no idea why you
67:21 - let there that definitely could have
67:23 - been cost see you can kind of see like
67:27 - my progression of this was all build
67:31 - this was built less than a year ago so
67:34 - right around this time last year is when
67:36 - I started to build this so this has been
67:38 - less than a year since I've come from
67:41 - jQuery spaghetti code and kind of using
67:45 - es6 but somewhat improperly
67:47 - to now where I'm at now which I think I
67:50 - still have a lot to learn and I still
67:53 - consider myself kind of a newbie in a
67:56 - lot of areas but you definitely see the
67:58 - progress that's always cool if you ever
68:01 - get down on your coding progress just
68:03 - look at something you did you know like
68:05 - a year before or you know even like six
68:07 - months before and then you'll you'll see
68:11 - how far you've come and you'll feel you
68:14 - feel a lot better about your your
68:16 - progress okay so basically what we need
68:19 - to do is take that date we're going to
68:20 - set it all right to a JavaScript date
68:23 - object I think that's how you would you
68:27 - would call it then we're gonna take that
68:31 - and we're just gonna break it out so
68:34 - that I'm gonna take this oh I named it
68:37 - this date right so that that new date
68:40 - that will save as a variable will pull
68:44 - the month out and then the months are
68:47 - actually zero indexed in javascript
68:50 - dates so we do have to add one to the
68:52 - month to get it to display properly then
68:58 - we'll get the the date which would be
69:02 - like the day of the month that's not
69:04 - zero indexed so we can display it
69:08 - normally this is crazy I think
69:10 - JavaScript dates are like the weirdest
69:12 - thing for me that you have some stuff
69:15 - seer index some stuffs not so there's a
69:17 - lot of areas that could trip you up and
69:20 - you wouldn't really know unless you
69:22 - and to read something about it or like
69:25 - like me like I've tried to do it and
69:27 - couldn't figure out why the date was
69:28 - always one month different than it
69:30 - should have been it's just it took me a
69:33 - lot to figure that out and then finally
69:36 - we get the full year so the format is
69:38 - just month / day / year that's a decent
69:45 - format I think I can keep it like that I
69:48 - think I will keep it like that and then
69:50 - that'll be the simplest for me yeah
69:56 - so let me I'm gonna put throw this over
69:58 - on my other screen so I can refer to it
70:00 - let's try to do the same thing but in a
70:04 - nicer way with no jQuery I don't think I
70:09 - actually used any jQuery in that example
70:11 - I just showed you so we can probably use
70:14 - most of it pretty much exactly as is so
70:22 - let's
70:28 - trying to think of whether I want to
70:30 - turn that
70:37 - I think I want to pass it pass the date
70:39 - object in and I think we can do this I
70:43 - think this will be okay so here instead
70:46 - of on post date I want to put it pass in
70:49 - new date and then the post date right
70:58 - this will save us from having to create
70:59 - a separate variable that'll be the date
71:02 - like like I did in the the other example
71:04 - and we'll just pass that and we won't
71:07 - have to create another variable and then
71:09 - on the other side we can just do
71:11 - whatever we want what we need to with it
71:13 - as a date object so hopefully it'll work
71:20 - and so then over here where we have date
71:26 - props date we it's still called the same
71:30 - thing it's still going to be prop state
71:32 - but instead we're gonna do first we're
71:35 - gonna say this actually I think I can
71:46 - copy this whole thing the strattice if I
71:51 - copy this entire thing and I actually
71:56 - put it in a template literal and I move
72:02 - all that this date stuff and turn it
72:04 - into props date
72:12 - then that should work let's check it out
72:21 - did I move it away I think I must yell
72:24 - yeah I've moved it on my other screen
72:25 - obviously but it worked so check it out
72:31 - we have the date the word correctly
72:34 - alright alright I'm gonna check back in
72:37 - with the live chat now that I've
72:39 - succeeded at something hey check the
72:43 - time - okay so probably about like 20
72:46 - more minutes of doing code and then I'll
72:48 - do some question and answer I'm gonna
72:53 - try to find out where I left off in the
72:58 - live chat okay I think I found it
73:10 - all right awesome so
73:20 - adhi says please tell me how to use a
73:23 - java console as the developer tool yes
73:26 - so the JavaScript console
73:27 - oh also from Nepal awesome that's
73:30 - awesome thanks for watching what's the
73:34 - what's the time in Nepal it should be
73:36 - around what like 1:00 a.m. over there
73:40 - something like that
73:42 - if so awesome thanks for watching that
73:48 - late if someone from Guatemala Poland
73:53 - alright yeah my um I have on my wife's
73:58 - side of the family relatives they came
73:59 - from Poland and then on my my one of my
74:03 - grandmother's her parents were were from
74:08 - Poland so really cool I'd like to visit
74:11 - there one day I mean that would be fun
74:14 - coming from Oregon from Sarajevo awesome
74:20 - okay let me get to here let me answer
74:22 - your question I was distracted by all
74:24 - the the places everywhere how much I
74:27 - love learning more about all these
74:29 - places around the world but I actually
74:32 - have never been outside my own country
74:34 - so I mean I'm from the United States
74:37 - says it's quite a large country so I
74:42 - have been to a lot of places within this
74:44 - country but I've never been outside so
74:46 - that way I would really love to one day
74:50 - I'd love to visit everywhere but maybe
74:54 - maybe it'll happen one day I think he'd
74:56 - be really cool to go to a like a
74:58 - JavaScript conference in another country
75:01 - that would be fun maybe like to speak at
75:04 - a conference or something so that gets I
75:05 - get to see the other country and meet
75:07 - all kind of people there and then also
75:09 - like code I would that would be cool so
75:14 - let's let me show you how to use dev
75:17 - tools
75:20 - so hopefully hopefully you're still
75:23 - watching because I think the question
75:25 - was asked quite a while ago like 45
75:27 - minutes ago super easy to use dev tools
75:30 - if you're using Chrome the Chrome
75:31 - browser you just right-click go down to
75:37 - inspect and you click inspect that
75:39 - brings it up once you're in here the
75:41 - first screen you'll see is this which is
75:44 - basically your Dom so it's all your
75:46 - elements on the page if you click on one
75:49 - of the elements you'll have this
75:52 - depending on your screen width it might
75:54 - be configured differently but if you
75:55 - click on one of the elements it'll show
75:57 - you all the Styles associated with it
75:59 - it'll tell you what style sheet that
76:01 - it's from and even what line on that
76:04 - style sheet that these you know see bits
76:10 - of CSS are located in so it's really
76:14 - cool if you don't want to go through it
76:16 - this way you can go this is often
76:18 - helpful for me they just kind of stack
76:20 - them all up here so it's easier to read
76:22 - and then if you click on one then you
76:24 - can see exactly where it came from you
76:26 - also have you know this thing down here
76:29 - is kind of handy you can switch around
76:31 - and see this is your console so you can
76:35 - see warnings and things down here you
76:39 - can even you see a bigger version here
76:42 - if you click this tab and then you can
76:44 - even put things down here so I could do
76:48 - like some JavaScript cause test equals
76:53 - five right and now I can go test and
76:58 - it's five right so I've just done
77:00 - JavaScript and she could write
77:01 - JavaScript in this console and just to
77:05 - test things out so it's really cool
77:07 - there's so many things it would I mean I
77:09 - could do like a month worth of live
77:12 - streams just going over dev tools
77:14 - there's so much stuff in here check out
77:17 - your network requests there's so much
77:20 - stuff but anyway that's like the basic I
77:22 - would say 90% of what I use is all just
77:25 - in this screen right here so anyway hope
77:29 - that was helpful I know it was I mean
77:30 - it's just a few minutes but maybe
77:32 - that'll be good to get you started
77:56 - okay regarding the the question from a
78:01 - long time ago about Zanna had about
78:03 - maybe I could just do some videos where
78:06 - I don't talk and I just code I think she
78:08 - just doesn't like to hear me I'm just
78:10 - joking I don't see no she's asking
78:14 - because basically you like I know
78:16 - obviously can't talk in code all day
78:18 - like it was it's it's a little bit
78:20 - slower to talk when I code and then I
78:22 - would probably lose my voice to be
78:24 - honest with you if I if I try to talk
78:26 - all day in code but so maybe you all
78:29 - would be able to see more of what I do
78:30 - and I just wouldn't worry about talking
78:33 - I would just show my screen so I asked
78:35 - for some feedback from you all about
78:37 - that
78:38 - Rohan said maybe I could just post a
78:43 - recording instead of a live stream
78:44 - that's definitely a possibility as well
78:47 - I said maybe I could do it on Twitch I
78:51 - just I don't want to take up the free
78:53 - code camp YouTube channel for like all
78:55 - day for a really long time in case
78:58 - someone else like Quincy wants to do a
79:02 - live stream of an interview or something
79:05 - Monica says twitch would be cool
79:08 - addy says no please do it on YouTube I
79:10 - don't use to it yeah that's I would have
79:12 - to learn how everything works with
79:14 - twitch so maybe it would be better I
79:15 - have my own channel on YouTube and I
79:19 - hadn't planned on doing live streams on
79:21 - that channel but I could yeah so maybe
79:27 - maybe I'll just do it on that channel
79:45 - okay sign up so then was talking about a
79:50 - sign-up link I think he needs to sign up
79:54 - link for the Udacity course so I will
79:57 - I'll put that in the stream let me look
79:59 - that up on my other screen here let's
80:08 - see oh yeah yeah okay so Sebastian did
80:13 - mention the courses it's five hundred US
80:15 - dollars and I don't know so I'm not sure
80:22 - if the price is different depending on
80:24 - the currency or how they are doing that
80:26 - but it's definitely it's not free I
80:32 - forgot to mention that it's actually
80:37 - yeah it is so I'm gonna put it in the
80:40 - debt right now but it actually is right
80:45 - on the home page it's the very first
80:47 - thing on the home page is a big button
80:51 - that says enroll now to become a react
80:53 - developer so yeah this is actually the
80:58 - first course I've paid for to learn
81:00 - anything
81:02 - coding related in a really really long
81:04 - time I did like a 30 dollar course I
81:07 - think from udemy a few years ago but
81:12 - that's the extent of what I've paid
81:20 - Prince Prince Ali Khan ass how's the
81:23 - Udacity course so far I really like it
81:26 - I'm learning a lot I'm incorporating
81:27 - what I've learned so far into my
81:30 - projects already so that's really cool
81:33 - it's been cool for me it consists the
81:37 - course the the Nanosuit see reacts
81:41 - nanodegree so the nanodegree program
81:44 - consists of three courses so one course
81:48 - you learn like the basics of react I
81:52 - forget what the second course focuses on
81:55 - I think it's like Redux and and things
81:58 - like that and then the third course is
82:00 - react native which lets you build like
82:03 - apps like mobile apps with react so so
82:07 - far I've gone through all the course
82:10 - material for a course one and I'm almost
82:13 - finished with the final project for
82:14 - course one as well so maybe if you're
82:19 - interested I can give you all updates of
82:21 - how the course is going and then if it
82:24 - ends up being good then maybe you want
82:25 - to pay for it but then otherwise you
82:27 - don't you don't have to spend your own
82:28 - money to before you know whether it's
82:30 - good or not I'll let you know but I've
82:32 - been I've been happy with it so far
82:55 - Mohammed Khan says free code can't
82:57 - taught me all the JSI know the outer
83:00 - section was the best well that's really
83:02 - that's kind of cool
83:03 - thanks for saying that okay actually I
83:11 - think I scrolled up a bit too far I must
83:13 - have just passed over some stuff and
83:15 - that's why I thought that I didn't get
83:18 - to that section before but this is no
83:23 - problem I'm glad I saw some of the
83:25 - comments that I had missed oh cool
83:33 - Zanna says she read about a guy on
83:35 - medium that was like 57 or 59 and was
83:39 - becoming a dev so that's really cool
84:00 - you been rusty says hats off to your
84:02 - comment Jesse but I can't remember what
84:04 - I said that would that would deserve a
84:06 - hats off so I wish I would've read that
84:11 - closer to when I said it
84:13 - Janice says sorry Jesse I'm not sure
84:18 - what you were apologizing for I don't
84:21 - think you did anything that you'd have
84:22 - to apologize for
84:35 - yeah there we go okay it says Santa said
84:39 - I should have Adam embedded on my screen
84:41 - or a bot that talks about that would
84:45 - actually be cool I don't know how to do
84:46 - BOTS in the YouTube live chat but that
84:49 - would be cool
84:50 - basically I always get asked like
84:53 - usually multiple times in the live chat
84:55 - what what editor I'm using so it's kind
84:59 - of like a running joke that there will
85:02 - always be a discussion of my code editor
85:05 - I don't mind it I think it's really fun
85:10 - to see how many times I get asked head
85:17 - ok I didn't see Zanna said she have to
85:22 - get had to go and I missed it so she
85:23 - probably can't hear this but thanks
85:26 - thanks for watching hopefully you can
85:30 - join us again tomorrow maybe she'll
85:33 - watch the recording and and hear that
85:51 - okay Manish is saying the the browsers
85:55 - dark github is dark yeah so uh yet I'm
86:01 - using a Chrome extension called
86:07 - tampermonkey and then I load it into
86:11 - tampermonkey some code that's called I
86:14 - think it's called github dark anyway
86:21 - it's so it lets you change the the
86:24 - colors of github so you can go in and I
86:30 - think I have I thought it ended up
86:37 - giving me like an extra there we go it
86:41 - gives you an extra setting panel in here
86:44 - so you can change I haven't even looked
86:48 - at any of these other themes maybe I
86:52 - should check out these other themes at
86:54 - some point I won't mess with it now cuz
86:58 - I'll end up taking a lot of time just
86:59 - looking through that but yeah so
87:02 - tampermonkey is so to get the github
87:04 - dark script so you'd have to install
87:07 - tampermonkey first and then find the
87:09 - github dark script and then use that
87:12 - with tampermonkey but it's really cool I
87:15 - kind of like it
87:23 - okay let's do yeah let's just do a bit
87:29 - more with the code and then I've done a
87:33 - pretty good job of keeping up with a
87:35 - live chat so it might not take that long
87:36 - to go through all the questions but if
87:39 - you if you have any questions for me
87:43 - then
87:44 - go ahead and put them in a live chat now
87:46 - and I'll get to them in a few minutes
87:49 - and we'll just do some some Q&A at the
87:51 - end here but for now let's see what we
87:55 - want to want to do so we have this let's
88:01 - let's do some some basic CSS stuff and
88:03 - that'll be cool because that way if
88:07 - anybody in here is not great with react
88:09 - yet then maybe you're you're better with
88:12 - your CSS skills so it'll be easier to
88:14 - understand so we're just gonna make this
88:17 - date you know kind of sit just right up
88:20 - here a bit and then let's change the
88:23 - color here for our posts for post titles
88:29 - I might drop this down to an h3 I think
88:35 - it's in h2 right now so let's just try
88:38 - to do those three things at least and
88:40 - then they will do some some QA so first
88:45 - thing is let's let's inspect this and
88:51 - see whether it's a margin or padding
88:52 - that we're dealing with so let me shrink
88:56 - this up so I can see so it looks like
88:59 - it's a margin so we have a margin of 30
89:04 - yet and let me see I don't need this
89:09 - down here something to get rid of this
89:11 - okay I think if we set the margin oh the
89:17 - bottom margin is only 24 I think if we
89:19 - set this bottom margin to zero that
89:22 - would work and we'll switch this to an
89:25 - h3 so let's do that
89:34 - and you see here now within react if you
89:38 - want to add a style so in react inline
89:42 - styles are totally fine normally when
89:44 - you're doing HTML usually it's
89:48 - recommended that you don't use n line
89:50 - styles but reacts it's a different story
89:53 - so within that I know I explained this
89:58 - almost every episode but there's there's
90:01 - always new people so I'm probably just
90:04 - going to explain it again because it
90:05 - only takes a minute
90:06 - so within react within this HTML like
90:11 - stuff called JSX we can go into we can
90:14 - use JavaScript so if we want to use
90:15 - JavaScript we just put these curly
90:17 - brackets and now anything inside this
90:19 - first set of curly brackets is
90:20 - JavaScript
90:21 - so inside there we've put in these other
90:23 - these other brackets which of course
90:25 - makes an object in JavaScript so within
90:28 - that object we put our styles and so in
90:31 - this case we're gonna use a margin
90:34 - bottom okay now since we're in
90:38 - JavaScript we're in a camel case right
90:40 - if we left that that hyphenated CSS
90:44 - there like you see here it would think
90:46 - that that's a minus sign and so we don't
90:48 - want that so we're gonna use camel case
90:50 - and just like normal you know normal
90:54 - JavaScript object we put our colon and
90:57 - then in single quotes I'm gonna put 0 is
91:05 - that's what we want our bottom margin to
91:07 - be the maze will change the color while
91:10 - we in here so if you want to do another
91:11 - one we put a comma right because
91:13 - remember this is an object and this
91:16 - click color and we need to grab the red
91:23 - color that we're using for resources so
91:28 - let's go over here grab this color
91:35 - oops forgot to put it there we go
91:40 - alright so that should take care of at
91:45 - least two of the things we wanted to do
91:47 - let's check it out
91:48 - yep there we go so now we have a
91:50 - different color actually that was all
91:54 - three right we wanted to change it yeah
91:56 - we changed it to an h3 yeah that looks a
92:03 - lot better I like that also I kind of
92:09 - wonder if we even need this much space I
92:16 - mean I can work on that maybe I'm
92:18 - getting a little bit too nitpicky here
92:20 - but I think we could probably do without
92:22 - a little space in here maybe like a
92:26 - horizontal rule here that kind of fades
92:30 - so no bill last week gave me sent me
92:34 - some code for doing a really nice
92:37 - horizontal rule that kind of fades so
92:40 - maybe I'll grab that and try to use it
92:42 - here I think that would look really nice
92:44 - just to differentiate between between
92:48 - posts also I need to get I need to work
92:53 - on this part here because obviously
92:56 - that's not how we want it to look but
92:59 - okay so it's about 3:30 Eastern Time and
93:02 - that's when I said that I was going to
93:04 - stop with the code and do the QA so if
93:06 - you were just watching for the coding
93:08 - portion
93:09 - I guess you you know you don't have to
93:12 - stick around anymore thank you so much
93:14 - for watching and I always I'll answer
93:17 - questions on Twitter in the comments of
93:19 - stuff so you know feel free to ask me
93:23 - elsewhere but thanks for watching
93:27 - otherwise if you have time to stick
93:28 - around for the question and answer put
93:30 - your questions in the live chat now and
93:33 - you know feel if you're in the live chat
93:34 - - feel free to answer some of the
93:36 - questions because I certainly benefit
93:39 - greatly from from your advice and your
93:43 - experience as well
93:45 - so let's let's take a look now I'm gonna
93:49 - scroll up I know I answered a lot of
93:51 - stuff already but I know it's I've
93:54 - probably missed a lot as well because
93:58 - I've been scrolling through the chat
94:00 - quite quickly so I'm gonna go through
94:05 - this chat now it's really cool I started
94:13 - saw a lot of new people in in the chat
94:16 - today so that's really cool so if you're
94:19 - new welcome and I really appreciate you
94:25 - checking things out today
94:27 - maybe we usually we have like yeah we
94:32 - have like double the amount of viewers
94:34 - that usually stick around to this point
94:36 - so I don't know what happened maybe I
94:39 - got tweeted or retweeted a lot or
94:42 - something but maybe it's just a good
94:45 - topic people were interested in I hope
94:48 - the topic wasn't too misleading because
94:50 - I kind of didn't really build an entire
94:52 - blog I had some of it like made already
94:55 - but I think I covered a lot of I didn't
94:58 - cover like how you set up WordPress to
95:00 - do this but in terms of how to pull in
95:02 - the data and stuff I covered a decent
95:04 - amount so sometimes it's I don't want to
95:10 - make a title too long so it's hard to
95:11 - explain like exactly what I'm doing
95:14 - but I don't want to be misleading either
95:28 - well I'm scrolling through this now I
95:30 - can see there is quite a bit of of chat
95:34 - going on about code editors
96:02 - okay looks like we did have some people
96:05 - early on asking about reacting what
96:07 - react is and I don't think I really took
96:10 - time to explain that so there was
96:12 - explanation in the live chat so as I'm
96:14 - scrolling through now I'll explain a
96:16 - little bit so the question was asked a
96:20 - long time ago so I'm not sure if the
96:24 - people who are wondering about it or
96:25 - even here but react is like it's a
96:28 - JavaScript framework and it really is a
96:32 - way to build like single page
96:33 - applications but not just that you can
96:35 - build apps with it like mobile apps as
96:37 - well but it allows you to you mix in
96:42 - like HTML and CSS and JavaScript and in
96:46 - a way that you can make these reusable
96:49 - components that if you do it right or
96:51 - really almost completely self-contained
96:53 - and you could use them in different
96:56 - projects like behind the scenes it's
96:58 - also really fast at updating the Dom
97:00 - because it keeps a copy of the DOM and I
97:04 - think they call it a shadow DOM and then
97:07 - when a page when things change on a page
97:11 - JavaScript can do its thing way faster
97:15 - than you can normally refresh the Dom
97:17 - and re-render everything so all that
97:19 - happens in the shadow DOM and then it's
97:22 - compared to the the real Dom on the
97:24 - screen Dom being the document object
97:27 - model that's like all the stuff that
97:28 - goes into your the web page that you see
97:31 - on your screen and it only rear Enders
97:36 - those parts of the dome that have
97:39 - changed so it's able to do things a lot
97:42 - faster because things that would
97:45 - normally require more time to do a
97:47 - complete dawn-marie render now don't
97:49 - take as much time so for sites that have
97:53 - like data changing and updating
97:55 - automatically it's really nice and I
97:58 - would assume you could probably see a
98:00 - performance increase from switching to
98:04 - react or maybe you know technology that
98:07 - might be a bit older so there's a lot of
98:10 - other cool things about react but that's
98:13 - kind of
98:14 - some basic stuff at least in my mind
98:17 - that's what I think of is the main
98:18 - things that stick out to me for for
98:21 - reacts and I should say I'm no expert in
98:24 - react I'm very much learning as I go
98:28 - along so if you'd like a more complete
98:31 - answer maybe somebody else in the chat
98:33 - has given one or you can find maybe you
98:37 - know the react documentation or some
98:39 - other YouTube videos that might be
98:40 - better I know they do a react conference
98:43 - every year and I'm sure some of those
98:45 - talks would be able to explain you know
98:48 - in a lot more depth and in a better way
98:51 - what react is you're from people who
98:54 - actually have worked on building react
99:08 - and Joe says angular seems more
99:11 - complicated to me than react I started
99:13 - learning react just two weeks ago and I
99:14 - already love it more than angular yeah
99:18 - my um my impression of angular is I
99:23 - haven't used angular in a couple years I
99:25 - think I've said this before so I don't
99:29 - have like an up-to-date opinion on
99:31 - angular but when I tried it it was hard
99:33 - for me to learn it was really cool but I
99:38 - couldn't get anything to work but I
99:40 - think that was due to my inexperience
99:42 - with with JavaScript and was setting up
99:45 - a build environment and it didn't have
99:48 - anything to do with angular so I'm not
99:51 - really sure about now angular's come so
99:53 - far since then so I don't I don't really
99:57 - have an opinion on the angular versus
99:58 - react debate
100:26 - okay Sebastian says Jessie check the
100:28 - package language babble and Adam it's
100:31 - for better display for react JSS
100:34 - actually I think I have that on my
100:36 - laptop I'll have to double check because
100:39 - on my laptop I have a different package
100:41 - for displaying everything and it like
100:45 - auto format some things for me in
100:48 - indents so I'll I should have the same
100:52 - packages on both of my computers for
100:56 - consistency so thanks for that it
100:58 - definitely I really do like it on my
101:02 - laptop
101:19 - okay I see now that Adi was thought was
101:22 - talking about the Java console I thought
101:25 - that so Adi had asked about using dev
101:30 - tools with Java and I just assumed that
101:34 - he meant JavaScript but it was really
101:40 - Java so sorry about that well maybe my
101:43 - answer to that question it was helpful
101:44 - for someone but sorry I didn't
101:46 - understand the question
102:10 - okay I'm just scrolling through so I for
102:14 - the the silent silent I'm just I'm just
102:18 - trying to read through this chat make
102:20 - sure I don't miss any of your questions
102:24 - Mohammed asked if this would be up later
102:27 - yes it will so the video may be just a
102:33 - minute or two after I've stopped
102:35 - streaming the video will be available to
102:37 - watch the recording on free code camps
102:39 - channel
102:55 - and I see there's some talk here about
102:57 - people being being newbies at code and
103:01 - stuff so I said before someone asked if
103:06 - if there's anyone else who noob here and
103:08 - I said yeah I'm a noob and I think I'm
103:11 - gonna I'm gonna get like a little bit
103:12 - deep here for a second I honestly think
103:16 - that when I really stop referring to
103:20 - myself as a noob I mean if I went in for
103:23 - a job interview I would you know I would
103:26 - be very confident and say I knew what I
103:27 - was doing but like among other
103:29 - developers and among you all if I ever
103:32 - stop referring to myself as a noob
103:34 - that's the point at which I think I
103:36 - would start stagnating right I would
103:40 - stop learning
103:41 - I think it's cool to have that mentality
103:44 - of a new person because when you're new
103:46 - starting out there's so much to learn
103:49 - and you know there's so much to learn
103:50 - and you're hungry to learn you know
103:52 - you're willing to work hard and learn
103:54 - and I always want to keep that I never
103:58 - want to want to lose that that desire to
104:01 - learn because I think that's that's
104:03 - important if you want to continue to be
104:05 - good and improve yourself so I'm always
104:08 - gonna answer the question like are you a
104:10 - noob I'm going to say yes yes I am
104:13 - because there's always something that I
104:17 - don't know about there's always some
104:19 - some piece of web development that I am
104:22 - a noob at like you can't be good at
104:24 - everything so it's entirely truthful to
104:26 - say I am a noob maybe there are certain
104:28 - things that I've gotten really good at
104:30 - and I couldn't honestly say that I'm a
104:32 - noob at but web development is so huge
104:34 - there's so many different things to
104:36 - learn I think we're all noobs and one
104:39 - way or another so when when I say noob I
104:43 - mean
104:43 - nothing bad about it at all I mean you
104:46 - know it's just a noob is just someone
104:48 - who recognizes that they have a lot to
104:50 - learn and are gonna learn it
104:55 - I'd much rather if I was gonna hire a
104:57 - developer I'd much rather hire someone
104:59 - who's a noob but really really wants to
105:02 - learn and work hard versus someone who's
105:04 - an expert but has just quit learning
105:08 - I don't know if any of you I'm reading
105:17 - through the live chat more but I don't
105:19 - know if anybody has ever seen any of the
105:21 - Rocky movies so like Sylvester Stallone
105:25 - did you know the Rocky Balboa movies or
105:27 - anything but when I think about keeping
105:32 - that idea of like constantly wanting to
105:35 - get better the the song from Rocky 3 the
105:41 - eye of the tiger song always plays in my
105:42 - head like and that spoiler alert really
105:46 - quick so you know don't listen to me for
105:49 - the next couple seconds if you haven't
105:51 - seen Rocky 3 but rocky ends up losing
105:55 - because he's lost that desire to keep
105:57 - getting better and then he ends up
105:59 - winning because he gets it back right so
106:01 - so I I always think about that movie
106:04 - because it's a great like illustration
106:06 - and film of the concept of always
106:09 - needing to keep improving yourself and
106:11 - then the movie the song it's about
106:13 - staying hungry right you want to stay
106:16 - hungry for for learning for getting
106:18 - better
106:32 - okay cabine us i think that's how you
106:37 - pronounce it it said create react app is
106:39 - good for setting up the development
106:41 - environment pretty quickly so not a
106:43 - question but that's a it's a really good
106:45 - really good advice so I want to make
106:46 - sure I read that out so I use next jazz
106:49 - for a lot of my projects but you might
106:51 - not need to use next for your project
106:53 - like if you don't need server-side
106:55 - rendering if you want to do your own
106:56 - setup your own routing you just don't
106:58 - need it then create react app is great
107:01 - I'm actually using it on my project for
107:03 - Udacity so I I'll be I have some
107:08 - experience with both and it's it's
107:10 - definitely a really easy way to get
107:13 - started without having to learn how to
107:15 - use webpack or anything like that it's
107:23 - actually cool some people were putting
107:24 - their their ages in the in the live chat
107:27 - so I want to read some of them out just
107:29 - to give give you an idea of the other
107:32 - people in the chat especially like if
107:34 - you're watching later and you can't see
107:35 - the live chat so we have you know
107:38 - someone's 30 someone's 52 someone's 39
107:42 - 44 someone said that they're 14 I'm 31
107:49 - so someone's 21 to people of all age
107:54 - ranges so if you feel like alienated
108:00 - because of your age there's probably
108:02 - someone else in this chat that is a
108:04 - similar age to use so don't don't feel
108:07 - like you know you have to go it alone
108:09 - and all honestly like we're all
108:12 - different ages and different skill
108:14 - levels and we're all in here in the live
108:15 - chat talking to each other so it doesn't
108:18 - really matter what your age or skill
108:20 - level is you still can you know
108:22 - contribute and you know join in in this
108:26 - kind of little community that we have
108:28 - here
108:58 - okay let's see
109:03 - Rohan is saying I think in in response
109:07 - to talking about doing a lot for the
109:09 - live chat wrote on Ramona's saying that
109:14 - there's like a YouTube API for getting a
109:16 - post in comments that's cool they offed
109:20 - it I won't have time to check it out
109:21 - probably for at least another two weeks
109:23 - but I'm intrigued by the idea of having
109:28 - something like that okay I could see
109:35 - when I was doing the dates you all had
109:37 - some good advice for me for dates so
109:39 - sorry about that I didn't really check
109:41 - the live chat because I knew I had done
109:42 - it before I just needed to find it
109:46 - Manish asks is that the seti thing it is
109:49 - the SETI theme for Adam so SETI SETI
109:52 - thing you someone Vendela said I should
110:02 - search the code for date I actually did
110:05 - but I'd use dates so many times it
110:07 - wasn't really helping me
110:21 - oh cool Andrew said that he's using
110:23 - github dark too from when he saw me use
110:26 - it so that's cool awesome I'm spreading
110:30 - the github dark theme I can't remember
110:33 - where I saw that I mean I it's not like
110:35 - I found it on my own I think I saw
110:37 - another youtuber using it as well and I
110:39 - found out what it was from the comments
110:41 - so I wish I could remember what I saw
110:43 - because I would give credit but I guess
110:47 - that's how it works though you know
110:48 - every everybody gets ideas off of
110:50 - everyone else and then we're all better
110:52 - off for it
110:58 - Patrick said you need some sauce for
111:01 - that code he was referring to all that
111:03 - crazy jQuery code that I had going on at
111:06 - the spaghetti code
111:07 - hey okay we've had some people are
111:15 - mentioning moment js2 use with dates so
111:18 - that's good to know I have to keep that
111:20 - in mind anybody has to work with dates
111:22 - check out moment J s I've heard it heard
111:24 - about it before but I haven't used it so
111:26 - in this case it was some pretty simple
111:28 - date things that I was doing but if I
111:31 - had some more complex things I think it
111:33 - would definitely be worth it to go with
111:34 - with something like mum and Jas
111:52 - I had some other suggestions so
111:56 - date-date FNS a date - FNS is another
112:01 - possibility so I might check it out I
112:04 - mean for right now it's doing what I
112:06 - wanted to do but I might maybe I'll
112:09 - check it out and see if I need to do
112:11 - some more things with dates
112:28 - cool I had asked Adi Adi said so Addie's
112:38 - sorry I was reading some Saudis from
112:41 - Nepal and I had guessed that maybe it's
112:43 - around 1 a.m. and so I was I was pretty
112:46 - close oh there's someone from Phoenix
112:51 - said it's hot in Phoenix
112:53 - I met it is hot I know I haven't been
112:55 - the Phoenix myself but I I know a few
112:57 - people from Phoenix and they've told me
112:59 - stories about how hot it gets so try to
113:02 - stay cool over there now okay Alberto
113:12 - had a great idea I said I didn't really
113:14 - want the date to stand out too much so
113:16 - the idea was making some sort of gray
113:19 - gray color so that's cool maybe I'll
113:21 - just it's black right now so maybe I'll
113:23 - just drop down the opacity a little bit
113:25 - lower I've usually it ends up being a
113:33 - bit more readable if instead of using
113:35 - like a hex color for grey you take black
113:38 - and then drop the opacity to make the
113:42 - grey I don't know why but visually it
113:45 - just looks slightly more readable
113:56 - oh cool all right here's a great tip
113:59 - this this might be the top tip for the
114:01 - day I could see this being really
114:04 - helpful so andrew says when using the
114:07 - react dev tools if you click on a
114:10 - component in the react panel you get a
114:12 - global variable that's dollar sign are
114:15 - referring to that component and you can
114:18 - change the state that's really cool to
114:21 - be able to test things out so thank you
114:23 - for that for that tip Andrew okay
114:31 - there's some questions about the the
114:34 - theme to turn things black so yeah if if
114:43 - you're referring to the chrome inspector
114:45 - like for dev tools it's built into dev
114:48 - tools actually so let me try to find
114:51 - yeah so if you go into dev tools and
114:53 - click on you notice little Settings icon
114:56 - and go down to two settings it has a
115:02 - theme here so you can choose between the
115:04 - light and the dark theme so it's already
115:06 - built in
115:29 - someone asks about the Udacity course to
115:32 - see if it covered Redux I just lost it I
115:38 - want it my my live chat scroll just
115:42 - jumped ups and I can't I don't know
115:46 - where I came right stuff that okay
115:53 - Vendela asks it doesn't cover Redux I'm
115:56 - pretty sure the react Udacity course
115:59 - does cover Redux I haven't gotten to
116:02 - that part yet so I can't say for sure
116:04 - and I can't can't remember but I think
116:07 - it does
116:13 - ok Manish you're still asking about the
116:16 - the github dark theme oh no so it seems
116:28 - as if the link to the github dark is
116:31 - broken
116:32 - that's thanks I wonder let me bring this
116:39 - up for a second
116:43 - yep github
116:52 - remind me later
116:59 - okay so I'm gonna I'm gonna copy and
117:02 - paste this into the into the chat this
117:13 - is the link that I said I have let me
117:19 - see if there's a better one this one
117:23 - should link like directly to some of the
117:28 - code you can see if that if that link
117:33 - will work better
117:41 - they're all and said the chat is
117:42 - unusually active today you're right it
117:44 - is it's like it's crazy how much what's
117:47 - going on I am almost to the bottom
117:50 - though so probably just a few more
117:52 - minutes and then I'll have to wrap it up
117:54 - so I have to get home
118:06 - ayoh says anyone know why the free code
118:10 - can't game of life on code pen doesn't
118:12 - rerender while scrolling I have no idea
118:15 - I don't know if I've ever looked at that
118:16 - so maybe someone else can can answer
118:19 - either the live chat or if you're
118:20 - watching us later maybe in the comments
118:22 - or something
118:35 - okay someone had suggested react
118:37 - fundamentals so yes like react
118:41 - fundamentals calm
118:42 - I lost where the link was but then then
118:45 - it says they don't use es6 so maybe to
118:52 - manage to check out modern react Redux
118:55 - by Stephen gritter so maybe the react
118:59 - fundamentals was a book and I'm just
119:01 - mistaken I haven't checked out either
119:05 - one of those so I can't say for sure but
119:06 - maybe if you want something that does
119:08 - use es6 check out the modern react Redux
119:14 - them says the line between front end and
119:17 - full stack seems blurry after all
119:19 - front-end devs do work on server-side
119:21 - stuff where do you draw a line or it's a
119:25 - gradual progression towards being a full
119:27 - stack engineer yeah that's a really good
119:34 - question I've thought of this before
119:36 - because you're you're right like I I
119:38 - know I mean I've even done on some of
119:41 - the streams some things that are
119:42 - definitely back-end for me so I was I
119:49 - was up for like the possibility of
119:51 - having my title changed and I said for
119:54 - sure I'm you know my my work is
119:57 - front-end development work my reasoning
120:00 - behind it was that I could say maybe
120:03 - like 10% of what I did was back-end work
120:07 - and the other 90% was probably front-end
120:10 - work mixed with design so for me I would
120:14 - I couldn't justify to myself calling
120:16 - myself full stack for me if I got to the
120:21 - point where it was more balanced and I
120:25 - was more knowledgeable about back-end
120:27 - things then I would be more comfortable
120:28 - saying full stack but I think you're
120:32 - right the line is definitely blurry I
120:34 - mean and where do you draw a line if you
120:36 - did 25% back-end and 70% front-end you
120:40 - know is that enough does it have to be
120:42 - closer to 5050 like and I mean everybody
120:44 - does different things maybe one week I
120:46 - think there there are weeks were all go
120:49 - entire week where I'm basically all
120:51 - going back end stuff the almost the
120:53 - whole week and then there are other
120:55 - times where I'll go like a month doing
120:57 - almost nothing with the back end so it
121:01 - is a weird line I would say honestly
121:03 - like whatever whatever job you can get
121:09 - that's what you end up being but
121:10 - whatever title they give you because it
121:12 - really is such a kind of a blurry a
121:15 - blurry line nowadays all right andrew
121:24 - has two questions all wrote grow up
121:28 - before I move on Roland said everyone is
121:30 - full-stack doesn't matter if you like it
121:32 - or not yeah there's definitely some
121:35 - truth in that comment like sometimes you
121:37 - just have to do everything to get a
121:40 - project done so Andrea two questions
121:42 - first question how how you holding XJS
121:45 - for async calls okay so I'm not I think
121:51 - this is what you're talking about are
121:54 - you talking about like when I make the
121:57 - API calls up here if so this get initial
122:02 - props is like if you put stuff in here
122:08 - this will render server side as well I'm
122:11 - not sure if this is what you're asking
122:12 - about or not but I think so and that's
122:19 - that is like a built-in thing into next
122:22 - and there's some documentation on it and
122:25 - their github repo as to how it works out
122:28 - I don't know exactly how it works
122:32 - the next question is did you encounter
122:34 - problems using jQuery and react and
122:36 - Sebastian already answered yes to that
122:39 - one so yeah it's true I did have
122:40 - problems actually I did a stream where I
122:44 - went through some of the problems with
122:47 - with react and jQuery so you can check
122:52 - out that stream if you want a longer
122:53 - explanation but basically yeah the
122:55 - problems found a lot of the problems
122:58 - come from two things one when you change
123:02 - the dawn
123:02 - with jQuery reacts doesn't know about it
123:05 - so you know normally you want to change
123:08 - things in state you know with set state
123:12 - and then react knows and can rerender if
123:14 - you start changing things in the Dom
123:17 - with jQuery it messes up reacts picture
123:22 - of what the Dom is you know that shadow
123:24 - Dom so you don't want to do that the
123:26 - other thing that gets messed up is a lot
123:28 - of the things that you do with jQuery
123:30 - you put inside your document already
123:32 - function well when you're using
123:34 - client-side routing inside react and
123:39 - when you're rerender in components with
123:41 - react some of those triggers that you
123:44 - would normally have trigger inside the
123:47 - document already function don't work so
123:50 - I had to find other ways to call those
123:54 - those things to initialize some of those
123:56 - those features that I was using that the
123:59 - use jQuery so a lot of times I could
124:02 - just do it in inside the component did
124:05 - mount function so it's like that that's
124:10 - a short answer I did a whole stream on
124:13 - how I got around it but it was actually
124:16 - I was able to get pretty much everything
124:19 - working I think that I I wanted to get
124:21 - working but if I had the time I'd like
124:24 - to go in and change everything over so
124:26 - that I'm not using jQuery at all but for
124:29 - now I'm still using some jQuery
124:47 - andrew says it might work their deaths
124:49 - with ten or more years of experiences
124:51 - still don't know all the tricks of death
124:52 - yeah definitely it's like you know you
124:55 - can't ever get to the end of it it's
124:57 - just changing so fast there's new stuff
125:00 - all the time
125:04 - packy says I'm a newbie and I gave three
125:08 - interviews made it to the final round
125:09 - but every time I find new things to
125:11 - learn from an interview says though
125:16 - not not made it through the HR round so
125:19 - cool that's I'm glad that's really good
125:23 - that you're able to learn things from
125:24 - your interview sometimes people get
125:26 - really down about interviews where they
125:28 - didn't get the job like it's a waste but
125:30 - it's definitely not a waste the
125:31 - experience you get is is really good
125:34 - them says you Adrian that's that's from
125:37 - the movie from the Rocky movie I was
125:38 - talking about earlier so so vim knows
125:41 - M's watched it says how to address
125:47 - interview frustration I'm really
125:49 - frustrated I Pike says I'm 25 I started
125:54 - last year I don't know with the
126:01 - interview I mean there's been times when
126:05 - I've been looking for jobs and trying to
126:07 - get you know do interviews and sending
126:09 - out you know a lot of resumes and things
126:11 - and it is really hard to get down you
126:14 - know to get through you get down on
126:15 - yourself a lot so I mean for me this is
126:20 - going to be really kind of general
126:21 - advice but the toughest thing for me was
126:25 - just like you get you get depressed
126:27 - because you can't find a job and then
126:30 - when you're depressed you don't want to
126:32 - do anything so you you stop looking
126:34 - since I get downward spiral where you
126:37 - know you're you don't want to do
126:38 - anything anymore you don't want to send
126:40 - out resumes or go on interviews you're
126:42 - still so down and then it makes it your
126:44 - chances of getting a job even worse so
126:46 - for the most important thing to me is
126:48 - breaking that downward spiral making
126:51 - sure you don't get into it and for that
126:53 - I think things unrelated to even coding
126:57 - or good so like exercise
127:00 - you know doing things that you like
127:02 - hobbies and things just to get your mind
127:06 - out of that negative cycle is good and
127:08 - then in terms of coding stuff like work
127:12 - on side projects that you like to keep
127:14 - up that sense of accomplishment you know
127:17 - contribute to open source projects like
127:19 - every time your pull request gets
127:20 - accepted you'll feel good and like
127:22 - that'll just give you that little lift I
127:24 - think that'll keep you out of you know
127:27 - getting so down on yourself and being
127:29 - depressed and it'll give you a sense of
127:31 - accomplishment so it'll help you going
127:33 - into the interviews because you can go
127:35 - in with confidence with real confidence
127:37 - you know because you have these little
127:39 - successes so that would be my advice I'm
127:42 - sure you know others in the chat and
127:44 - others watching this later on we'll
127:46 - probably have some you know even better
127:47 - advice as well but for me that's always
127:50 - just a struggle for me is you know
127:53 - keeping enough confidence just to keep
127:56 - going and not get into that just
127:58 - sluggishness of you know not wanting to
128:01 - do anything because you get too down on
128:02 - yourself
128:07 - Rowan says when is it not hot in Phoenix
128:10 - so earlier I think it was I think Monica
128:12 - mentioned that it was really really hot
128:14 - in Phoenix so Rowan that's probably I
128:16 - think it is always hot in Phoenix I'm
128:18 - like there may be times where it's
128:21 - slightly cooler but it's still probably
128:23 - hotter in Phoenix all the time than it
128:25 - is you know where I'm from in Ohio
128:43 - yeah Rowan said yeah it is after four
128:46 - well I got carried away okay so I'm
128:48 - gonna wrap it up now because I have to
128:52 - go and take my son to karate so there's
128:57 - a few more questions in there sorry I
129:02 - didn't get to it so if you're still
129:04 - listening and you're like one of the
129:05 - people that have a couple question at
129:07 - the bottom so like umberto is writing
129:10 - something and oh okay Kevin did say I
129:14 - will read this out react Saddam is
129:16 - called virtual Dom shadow Dom as part of
129:19 - web components thank you so much I can I
129:21 - can't ever keep it straight I always mix
129:23 - them up so I apologize before I was
129:25 - calling reacts virtual Dom a shadow DOM
129:28 - and it's not that's something different
