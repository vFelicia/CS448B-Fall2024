00:02 - hello everybody
00:04 - today we're going to try to do some
00:06 - coding challenges um i'm going to do a
00:08 - quick introduction first
00:10 - my name is tom
00:13 - and i work for free code camp and i
00:15 - created the relational database courses
00:18 - that are now available on
00:19 - freecodecamp.org
00:21 - and i will share a link in the
00:23 - description
00:25 - to those if you want to try them out
00:27 - with me here is sean you want to
00:29 - introduce yourself sean
00:31 - yeah sure hello code breakers
00:33 - my name is sean i
00:35 - also work for free code camp and i
00:37 - created the rustic raptor course as well
00:39 - as the euler rust project
00:43 - whoops
00:44 - yeah
00:46 - it's there there he is
00:50 - okay so what are we what are we gonna do
00:52 - today sean
00:54 - so today
00:56 - we have been invited by brooke by tech
00:59 - domains to
01:01 - do their break the code
01:03 - this is the second time break the code
01:05 - has come out the first time was in 2020
01:07 - and it was hugely popular so
01:10 - today tom and i are going to be going
01:13 - through
01:14 - and doing a let's play of break the code
01:16 - 2.
01:19 - yeah i haven't uh i haven't checked it
01:22 - out at all other than this first screen
01:25 - um
01:27 - yes i don't really know what it's all
01:29 - about but uh looks like there's some
01:32 - signing to get playing rules and prizes
01:36 - let's uh
01:38 - check out some rules basically there's
01:39 - like a timeline it says there's eight
01:42 - days left which would make it finish on
01:45 - april 15th i think
01:49 - um
01:50 - so if you're able to get it done by
01:53 - april 15th
01:55 - you can win some of these prizes instead
01:57 - is that how it works
01:59 - yes that sounds about right so
02:01 - they started
02:03 - on april 1st and they opened these
02:05 - drives sequentially
02:08 - and each drive contains missions that
02:10 - you do
02:11 - and
02:11 - we're going to find out what those
02:12 - missions are for
02:14 - drives one and two but currently drive
02:17 - three is open which you can complete and
02:18 - when the price is associated with that
02:20 - drive
02:24 - so it's like there's some pretty
02:26 - nice prizes here
02:29 - good old ps1
02:31 - and a ps5 so yeah we're gonna try and
02:34 - finish these first two drives today i
02:36 - think and then um
02:39 - yeah if you finish drive one you can
02:41 - potentially win a ps5
02:43 - or some other things
02:45 - drive two the grand prize is a macbook
02:48 - pro
02:49 - and drive three
02:51 - um
02:52 - five thousand dollars worth of ethereum
02:54 - what's that right
02:56 - well that's what it looks like yeah
02:59 - it's quite impressive
03:01 - and these are surprises yeah i don't
03:04 - know what this is code breakers layer
03:08 - custom gaming rig and monitor okay and
03:10 - share oh that's what this is right here
03:17 - all right well
03:18 - um
03:19 - i suppose if you are watching this
03:22 - post
03:23 - when the prize and the competition has
03:26 - ended um you can
03:28 - still welcome to watch and get the
03:29 - entertainment value from tom trying to
03:30 - go through this oh
03:33 - i'm gonna find a way to drag you into
03:34 - this don't worry about it
03:40 - i think we're going to try and treat
03:41 - this as a pure dev session
03:45 - supposedly the missions are quite a bit
03:46 - like um
03:49 - i suppose coding challenges so
03:52 - let's find out
03:55 - all right well i started this up and it
03:58 - says uh i have a new email from
04:00 - carehq
04:04 - and it's dated december 99.
04:07 - it looks like it's some
04:09 - recruiter is looking to hire me
04:12 - um suppose out lock express
04:19 - so yeah this is kind of cool we got like
04:20 - a windows 95 or 98 theme going on
04:25 - yeah i believe it's 98.
04:29 - no this is awesome
04:31 - click on click on clippy there
04:33 - let's see
04:35 - i got the job at here okay
04:37 - yes i uh
04:41 - read the first sentence of that email
04:44 - anyway
04:45 - i'm clicking on
04:46 - clippy and not much is happening oh
04:48 - something happened
04:51 - a bunch of stuff showed up don't click
04:53 - me okay
04:56 - that's tempting isn't it
04:58 - it sure is
04:59 - um
05:00 - i guess
05:02 - we'll just
05:03 - close the email
05:05 - and
05:07 - play around a little bit we got log off
05:09 - shut down classic
05:12 - i'll see what programs they say
05:19 - not pad
05:22 - code editor isn't wasn't notepad the
05:25 - code editor
05:26 - back on 98.
05:29 - ipad was just everything
05:32 - everything text
05:36 - now we have easter eggs left behind
05:39 - well i can't type
05:43 - all right so i'm assuming this is maybe
05:46 - something we're going to be using
05:50 - um i imagine we'll try and use a lot of
05:53 - it
05:54 - mine labor
05:59 - this is this is like riding a bike here
06:04 - bringing back good memories
06:06 - yeah
06:08 - did you ever play minesweeper
06:10 - oh yeah quite a lot
06:12 - i didn't spend much time on
06:14 - uh windows 98 but
06:17 - i had windows xp for about
06:19 - 10 years until windows 10 came out and
06:22 - then upgraded from xp to windows 10.
06:25 - so it was quite the jump
06:35 - yeah
06:36 - um
06:38 - well we know we're supposed to go
06:39 - through the drives so
06:42 - i think we should just start as drive
06:43 - one
06:45 - oh i'm hearing
06:46 - noises i don't know if if that's coming
06:50 - through or not um
06:52 - i can't hear any
06:54 - revamp it's a sealed uh yeah napster
06:58 - when amp and napster
07:01 - um
07:03 - this is classic
07:06 - what we got here
07:07 - drive one i guess we'll click on this
07:10 - okay code breaker tom
07:13 - even though you're still considered
07:14 - recently recruited code breaker carol b
07:17 - assigning you a mission of top level
07:18 - importance
07:20 - three of our essential satellites have
07:21 - been systematically disconnected during
07:24 - recent sync attempts okay so we've got
07:26 - some
07:28 - satellites that are disconnected sounds
07:31 - like a problem
07:32 - our technicians have had a hard time
07:35 - identifying pattern but they have
07:36 - uncovered traces of a virus
07:38 - linked to the anarchist organization
07:41 - dot gang
07:43 - okay our intel has uncovered four areas
07:47 - of investigation
07:48 - that we believe could have clues
07:51 - to regain control
07:53 - we need you to assess the situation and
07:55 - attempt to access the damaged systems
07:58 - at the same time keep an eye out for dot
08:00 - gang's methods that we can exploit down
08:02 - the line okay oh boy maybe that's
08:05 - take some notes or something
08:08 - and drive on you'll find all the leads
08:10 - that we have collected in our
08:12 - investigations analyze each one and try
08:13 - to find the relevant connections
08:16 - report everything you find in hq
08:19 - as with all covert assignments unless
08:22 - specifically authorized by hq take no
08:24 - action all right
08:27 - sean
08:28 - so
08:29 - what are you thinking
08:30 - i'm thinking
08:32 - we're investigating
08:34 - we're investigating their satellites
08:35 - going down and we need to just report
08:37 - everything we find
08:39 - including
08:40 - potentially if we find something useful
08:42 - that this
08:43 - anarchist organization has done
08:46 - then we need to
08:47 - keep it in our
08:49 - repertoire of tricks to potentially use
08:51 - against them
08:56 - okay
08:56 - [Music]
08:59 - so maybe i should use that notepad well
09:02 - let's just uh explore i guess and if we
09:05 - come across
09:06 - information maybe we'll take a note um
09:11 - drive one
09:12 - okay
09:13 - g drive
09:16 - c drive look at that
09:19 - a giant bunny was spotted leaving
09:23 - go dot tech oh slash okay maybe open the
09:26 - web explorer
09:29 - g chords
09:30 - yeah it's also useful
09:33 - yeah now go where they
09:35 - where clippy told you to go
09:38 - oh geez i just said it
09:40 - yeah
09:43 - it was something that tech slash
09:49 - oh is and i hit the back button browser
09:51 - took
09:52 - browser hotkeys took over
09:57 - drive one box of chocolates now
10:01 - and i go to one ladder
10:07 - and go to that website
10:10 - can't copy
10:14 - there we go
10:20 - awesome
10:22 - because obviously nada are involved with
10:25 - getting the
10:26 - satellites up in there so
10:30 - they must be
10:35 - how did you put that one together that
10:38 - just went right over my head
10:43 - no no no okay okay
10:46 - moonwalking or moon driving
10:48 - got an article here
10:51 - security update that sounds potentially
10:54 - useful um
10:57 - and he had an unscheduled stop on a
10:59 - malfunctioning seat belt
11:04 - i don't know how much of this
11:05 - information is
11:06 - useful nada clearly needs a librarian
11:10 - that's another hint we need to hear
11:15 - [Music]
11:26 - okay there's a lot of information here
11:28 - um
11:31 - that's frequently asked questions
11:35 - uh no this is clickable
11:37 - no okay
11:40 - none of this is clickable
11:47 - 1919 the internet's friendly reminder
11:52 - that life is slipping away click the
11:55 - lifespan
11:57 - none of these are clickable but
12:00 - that sounds
12:01 - scary
12:04 - i wonder if it's a white y2k thing
12:06 - probably
12:07 - that's probably what the ads look like
12:09 - on
12:10 - on the internet 99
12:14 - the death the giant internet death is
12:17 - coming y2k
12:23 - so they they recently needed to change
12:25 - their passwords
12:27 - and
12:28 - currently there are three letter
12:29 - passwords so that's something we can
12:30 - guess
12:34 - [Music]
12:37 - i called jackson moon walked on the moon
12:39 - would we call it a
12:41 - moonwalk
12:44 - would we talk
12:46 - what are you reading
12:48 - you didn't see the note from cliffy
12:51 - no what did it say
12:52 - michael jackson moonwalk on the moon
12:54 - would we call it a moon moonwalk
12:58 - yes
12:59 - yes you would
13:03 - [Music]
13:05 - so really probably should just read all
13:08 - this huh
13:09 - no i wouldn't i think
13:12 - not that much if we get it just of it we
13:14 - can just move on and if we need to come
13:16 - back to it we will
13:20 - i think there's probably weird hints in
13:21 - there like when it talks about
13:24 - malfunctioning seat belts and
13:28 - you know morium of charles pete and the
13:30 - fact that all passwords are currently
13:32 - three letters
13:37 - yes please do not use the same three
13:39 - letters three times
13:43 - that sounds like a hint
13:45 - that's what clippy said
13:47 - no right there on the
13:50 - uh
13:51 - yeah
13:55 - okay
13:59 - new so the new format is nine
14:02 - and the current
14:03 - three letters will be phased out
14:08 - yeah this is
14:11 - [Music]
14:19 - any idea where we're going with it
14:22 - so the other thing
14:24 - um
14:25 - there's these three buttons resolve is
14:28 - where we
14:29 - go when we think we have the answer
14:31 - right i've already forgot
14:34 - yeah
14:36 - though but i don't have any answers
14:41 - has used national's old account right
14:43 - okay so they use the three letter
14:45 - password
14:46 - to erase all the logs
14:50 - and the first part of their password is
14:52 - cbc
14:54 - first the first part of their new
14:56 - password so is that the new
14:59 - they use an astronaut's old account so
15:01 - the astronaut's new account starts with
15:03 - cpc
15:07 - uh you know what
15:09 - the password is definitely cpc cpc cpc
15:13 - why
15:14 - because it says ps do not use the same
15:17 - three letters three times
15:23 - wouldn't that mean it couldn't be that
15:26 - please do not use the same three letters
15:29 - three times do not or
15:31 - well i don't know if i'm told that with
15:32 - my password i'm definitely going to do
15:34 - it
15:37 - so you're saying because they said not
15:38 - to do it that that's what you would do
15:41 - yeah
15:42 - that sounds about right in my mind well
15:43 - let's just try it huh
15:45 - are we allowed to get the answer wrong
15:48 - i don't know
15:50 - but it looks like that's the format
15:53 - wrong answer okay maybe we should just
15:56 - build a brute force
15:57 - script to try and
16:00 - well what if we know
16:03 - what if we do permutations of that cpc
16:06 - so we do cpc ccp pcc
16:12 - i think the whole answer
16:16 - because
16:19 - because that's just guessing
16:20 - yes
16:24 - what's your idea
16:27 - um keep exploring until we find
16:30 - well you got that wrong anyway what
16:32 - we're supposed to find um there's a lot
16:35 - of
16:37 - permutations there i think um
16:41 - okay see would help hint hint hint no we
16:43 - don't want his
16:45 - hints
16:45 - we probably need them but yeah
16:50 - we can set ourselves a time limit and if
16:51 - we don't get there we'll just oh there
16:53 - we go look in the world of charles pete
16:56 - conrad that's why it's cpc
16:58 - charles p conrad oh that sounds
17:01 - interesting
17:04 - nice eyes on that one
17:07 - a former navy test pilot
17:11 - right there cpc died
17:14 - at the hospital in
17:16 - fuji
17:22 - my thought here was that in this little
17:25 - snippet on the left
17:27 - we have
17:28 - three words that are capitalized and
17:31 - then it says that
17:33 - i wanted to just kind of see if i could
17:35 - see anything else here's something jbi
17:39 - yeah i think that's probably also
17:40 - important james benson irwin so we got
17:43 - two names and two
17:46 - capitalized
17:48 - abbreviations is there there's seatbelt
17:50 - rock no
17:53 - seatbelt rock
17:55 - there's something about these astronauts
17:58 - but it's six feet under okay there's
17:59 - gotta be another astronaut name well
18:01 - that's because of the charles p conrad
18:04 - who died
18:08 - okay so they're making jokes about
18:11 - somebody's
18:13 - is that what's happening i think the
18:14 - theme here the theme here is death
18:16 - because we have the death clock right we
18:18 - have white okay
18:19 - and we have these astronauts so that's
18:21 - definitely something
18:24 - so
18:27 - well i think one one dead astronaut are
18:30 - these ones dead
18:32 - no
18:34 - okay
18:35 - what what were you gonna say
18:38 - well
18:39 - i think
18:47 - do you think there's anything in that
18:48 - that hint that clippy gave of
18:54 - no who knew astronauts needed to be so
18:57 - first look at look at those ads
19:00 - yes
19:02 - maybe i'm thinking was abs capitalized
19:06 - i can't remember
19:09 - well i think you can always try this
19:11 - there's no harm in doing that so
19:13 - so we got c p c dash j b i
19:19 - i slash abs
19:36 - what if it's abs
19:38 - jbi
19:42 - well we didn't find them in that order
19:44 - so it can't be that hard
19:49 - all right
19:54 - oh wait
19:56 - oh snap he got it
19:59 - awesome man we're good at this
20:02 - excellent extraction
20:04 - code breaker now that we have the full
20:06 - password we can take back control of the
20:08 - hacked account
20:10 - so doc gang won't be able to use it on
20:12 - our satellites
20:14 - i'm going to record that password so the
20:16 - cpc
20:17 - abs
20:18 - and
20:23 - no i don't have
20:25 - no i'm pretty sure twitter didn't exist
20:28 - back then
20:32 - yeah that's a good point
20:34 - um
20:36 - i'm not alone
20:38 - on this um
20:40 - oh i get it now i see there's there's
20:43 - four things for drive one that we all
20:44 - have to finish
20:47 - things to share with friends what was it
20:49 - i saw pizza but
20:52 - pizza and drinks i think
20:56 - so where did our
20:58 - our
21:00 - three hints there two of them were in
21:02 - that article and one came from clippy
21:04 - right
21:06 - i think they all came from libby because
21:07 - tippy talked about the dead astronaut
21:09 - who was cbc
21:11 - that we talked about the
21:13 - astronaut with the six-pack
21:19 - [Music]
21:28 - there's no way to get the abs one
21:30 - without
21:32 - clippy and the other two were in that
21:34 - article
21:37 - i don't think there's anything saying
21:39 - that we have to find all of the hints on
21:40 - the one page
21:42 - yeah
21:43 - but things to share with your friends
21:45 - clearly songs is something you're
21:47 - sharing 141 songs
21:49 - so
21:51 - maybe this is another thing of three and
21:53 - 141 is the first
21:56 - this looks very
21:59 - copyright
22:00 - problematic
22:04 - what are they
22:05 - piracy that's what they called it right
22:06 - yeah you're not supposed to do this you
22:08 - haven't even looked at the brief of this
22:10 - yet
22:11 - okay okay brief mission
22:13 - part
22:14 - 1b
22:16 - napster
22:17 - we intercepted communication
22:19 - that revealed
22:21 - dot gang's plan to inject a virus into
22:23 - napster downloads neither be a virus
22:25 - here
22:26 - so i heard of this song
22:30 - have you heard of this software it's
22:31 - absurd it plays to share compressed
22:33 - music files through the internet
22:36 - there's no way the public would be
22:38 - interested in something like this but we
22:40 - need to get ahead of it so begin your
22:41 - next mission do whatever you can to
22:43 - identify the virus
22:46 - okay so potentially one or more of these
22:48 - files are viruses and let's see mission
22:52 - name napster drive one mission two
22:54 - answer okay
22:56 - so we have two hints so far
22:59 - the one is things to share with friends
23:01 - we saw pizza i'm thinking songs is the
23:03 - other
23:04 - and then
23:05 - something about looking at the songs so
23:07 - many typos
23:09 - if you know you're going to love or hate
23:11 - the song from the very first word
23:15 - well
23:16 - i see a typo here
23:19 - okay
23:22 - a lot of viruses do have typos in them
23:27 - here's a typo so i see two tables
23:31 - are we looking for the letters that are
23:33 - missing
23:34 - like h and a
23:36 - it's a type of oh maybe b
23:39 - you're nobody's supposed to be here so
23:41 - that'd be an h
23:43 - and
23:44 - have you ever a
23:46 - a so aj
23:48 - hard knock life ghetto anthem livin la
23:52 - vida loca
23:54 - i think that's probably the virus right
23:56 - there

24:26 - difficult to say yeah
24:28 - nikki
24:29 - it's not right but it's okay
24:32 - there's a comma missing
24:34 - give it to you oh there's one why
24:38 - i guess i've always felt the word happy
24:40 - i don't think that's a coincidence
24:47 - so
24:48 - shall we try it
24:50 - happy yeah
24:52 - h-a-p-p-y
24:55 - happy
24:56 - gilmore

25:06 - so this was
25:08 - music kid is that me
25:10 - is that us
25:12 - and gang oh
25:14 - oh there they are
25:16 - that's the that's the
25:19 - the hackers or whatever

25:24 - but goodies robbie
25:26 - robertson
25:27 - up on creek
25:30 - moses
25:31 - ellison mosey allison parchman farm
25:35 - willie nelson georgia on my mind
25:38 - that's race to play i don't see any
25:40 - typos
25:48 - now
25:49 - this one here looks like there might be
25:52 - a typo because
25:54 - has a capital d
25:56 - in a lower case s
26:00 - interesting
26:03 - the one above also has a capital t
26:04 - though so maybe the lowercase s is more
26:07 - important
26:09 - yeah like this one has on capitalize
26:12 - so everything is capitalized it looks
26:14 - like except for
26:18 - test here happy
26:26 - [Music]
26:33 - this one's cut off
26:34 - can i see the rest
26:39 - i don't know if i could
26:43 - okay well that's the only thing that i
26:45 - see
26:48 - um
26:49 - frequencies times length
27:04 - someone
27:06 - yeah i was looking at the length to try
27:08 - and see if something seemed strange
27:13 - 555
27:16 - that seems fake
27:19 - um
27:20 - you could go online and look up the
27:23 - length of the songs that they actually
27:25 - are to see if they match
27:27 - we do have the web explorer
27:30 - we do
27:32 - i don't think we really have access to
27:33 - the internet though
27:36 - i think my camera is a little off here
27:39 - you know are you going to level hate a
27:41 - song from the very first word
27:44 - how do you tell if you're going to love
27:45 - or hate a song from the very
27:58 - maybe try happy together
28:03 - are we looking for one song or multiple
28:05 - songs
28:07 - well i think like this first area
28:10 - we put together the word happy from the
28:12 - missing typos so i
28:14 - don't know i think we just need like one
28:17 - word or one
28:19 - group of words so yeah
28:21 - and all the length of those songs is
28:22 - zero
28:24 - happy together
28:27 - napster for movies
28:31 - so
28:32 - high school musical cast we got some
28:33 - artists and then we're all in this
28:35 - together get together
28:37 - we all stand together together
28:40 - better together get yourself together
28:41 - happy together
28:43 - um
28:45 - well this one has
28:47 - a longer dash
28:49 - than the rest of them
28:55 - happy dash together
28:59 - so yes you're right the length is all
29:01 - zero
29:02 - that could be a potential
29:06 - clue
29:07 - file size is zero so these are all
29:11 - clueless man all these but goodies music
29:13 - kid
29:15 - can i click on anything else
29:20 - upgrade your billboard magazine
29:22 - subscription
29:24 - no i don't want any help
29:29 - well
29:32 - suppose something else
29:35 - i don't know can you go to the web
29:36 - explorer and
29:38 - go to go go.text reddit or something
29:51 - slash reddit
29:55 - we go and get help from the community i
29:57 - suppose
29:59 - was it this course or discord
30:02 - i don't know
30:04 - it's a word
30:11 - uh now clip he's just giving us bad hits
30:16 - uh clippy's getting frustrated with us
30:18 - we are too slow um
30:23 - okay
30:24 - i think all the clues are in here though
30:26 - somewhere
30:31 - well so far we're certain of happy entry
30:34 - pretty sure yeah
30:37 - there's something about happy
30:40 - there's something special about together
30:42 - there
30:43 - yeah
30:45 - and the length
30:46 - of the songs
30:48 - and so far clippy has said
30:50 - that something about missing a beat i
30:53 - didn't catch that one
30:56 - um
30:58 - we looked at the songs for the typos
31:02 - and things to share okay 4 million songs
31:04 - 150 000 users
31:07 - i twitter get go
31:11 - so you have 141 songs is that special
31:19 - i thought it said 140 when we first
31:22 - started
31:24 - yeah
31:25 - okay
31:28 - um
31:29 - so
31:31 - i i don't know
31:32 - were you going somewhere with that
31:35 - well i'm trying to think i'll be coming
31:37 - up with maybe
31:39 - another three
31:41 - um
31:44 - three set of three password
31:48 - so i listed these
31:51 - i'm thinking it's just
31:54 - maybe three words you know one word
31:56 - happy i think is the word for this page
31:58 - and then we've got these other two pages
32:00 - i don't know if we need to find a word
32:02 - in each one or
32:04 - a word
32:05 - combined
32:06 - go back to the brief let's see if
32:08 - there's a hint there
32:11 - we intercepted communication
32:13 - that revealed.gang's plan to inject the
32:16 - virus into napster downloads have you
32:18 - heard of this software it's absurd a
32:19 - place to share compressed music files
32:21 - through the internet
32:22 - there's no way the public would be
32:23 - interested in something like this
32:25 - clearly
32:26 - but we need to get ahead of it so begin
32:28 - your next mission and do whatever you
32:29 - can to identify the virus happy so one
32:33 - one of the files is going to be the
32:35 - virus
32:37 - i'm not sure if it's just one file but
32:40 - yeah you might be right but you would
32:42 - think
32:44 - like happy together would be it what if
32:46 - you type in that whole thing the turtles
32:49 - happytogether.mp3
32:51 - there you go
32:52 - now you're thinking
32:55 - turtles happy
32:58 - together
33:00 - mp3
33:02 - no
33:03 - did i misspell something
33:05 - try without the mp3
33:10 - i just feel like we're missing something
33:15 - because there's still
33:18 - typos here like there's this dash and
33:20 - something on this page let's pretend
33:23 - that's a hint you know what would be
33:24 - great napster for movies
33:32 - any of these movies
33:35 - quite
33:36 - possibly
33:38 - high school musical that's a movie kind
33:40 - of
33:42 - yeah all in this together get you the
33:45 - real statues what is the turtles
33:47 - you know this this one this one is not
33:50 - capitalized either this i
33:53 - everything else is capitalized almost
33:56 - and the and
33:59 - yeah but those aren't supposed to be
34:00 - capitalized if this was written
34:02 - correctly but there are all capitalized
34:04 - everywhere else here in the
34:08 - i mean it's supposed to be capitalized
34:10 - when it's a song pick songs and bring
34:12 - them together into a brand new playlist
34:14 - that's what we're doing
34:16 - we can't do anything with these
34:18 - no no but we're clearly trying to
34:21 - take
34:22 - a collection of all of these songs and
34:24 - make a brand new playlist
34:28 - so
34:30 - i think we just need
34:32 - a small a few few word answer is what we
34:34 - need i don't know what you mean by make
34:36 - a playlist
34:39 - well
34:41 - there's something in all three of those
34:43 - that would make
34:46 - a playlist
34:50 - write down these these uncapitalized
34:52 - letters s
34:57 - i
34:58 - i
35:09 - um
35:10 - and then there's this weird dash okay
35:13 - will we say now we need to make a
35:14 - playlist somehow i don't know
35:17 - well try that try happy sia
35:21 - sure
35:25 - could be
35:26 - capitalized
35:29 - i wouldn't put a space yeah yeah see ya
35:32 - is that a song
35:34 - see ya as an artist
35:39 - well then you should say sia happy yeah
35:45 - um
35:47 - come on fingers crossed
35:49 - kept less
35:52 - i wonder how specific it's gonna be
35:57 - um
36:00 - see ya
36:01 - mp3
36:11 - do you know any of her songs by chance
36:14 - no
36:16 - nothing's coming to mind
36:24 - um
36:28 - [Music]
36:30 - that sounds like that's on the right
36:32 - track to be honest i don't know see ya
36:36 - happy together
36:40 - this whole page has the word together in
36:42 - it
36:43 - yeah
36:44 - kind of strange
36:47 - okay well let's keep that in our mind so
36:49 - we have happy and together and go to
36:51 - please but goodies
36:57 - what's special about this one because we
36:59 - haven't really seen anything other than
37:00 - the
37:01 - missing capital wise
37:05 - from the very first word i assume that's
37:07 - happy
37:08 - maybe it's not
37:10 - love or hate
37:17 - so
37:24 - that whole page is capitalized weird too
37:27 - hey here's another typo there's a colon
37:29 - right there
37:32 - interesting
37:34 - what did that last thing say
37:37 - upgrade
37:38 - to the new millennium
37:40 - to yeah
37:43 - fix the virus so if i change my time
37:51 - break the code to prizes catalog
37:54 - yes
37:58 - i think go to start and look for
38:01 - the way to change the data
38:12 - display
38:14 - [Music]
38:16 - so there's a show clock
38:18 - thing right
38:20 - in settings
38:22 - yeah but just show clock it wasn't
38:27 - well click show hidden files and folders
38:29 - that might be useful for later
38:31 - there we go
38:39 - that looks interesting
38:42 - that's potentially helpful later on or
38:45 - something
38:47 - select screen saver
38:50 - okay
38:52 - we'll go to this one anyway because
38:57 - um
39:01 - okay
39:06 - so
39:07 - i don't see a way to change that i
39:09 - clicked on this i can't change anything
39:12 - um
39:15 - don't click me
39:17 - mine leaper terminal my computer
39:21 - what's in the readme
39:30 - it's december 31st 1999 the cusp of the
39:32 - new millennium
39:34 - the electricity in the air makes this
39:36 - day feel like a once-in-a-lifetime event
39:38 - upcoming parties will be the stuff of
39:40 - legend but while people plan their new
39:43 - year celebrations in the real world an
39:44 - unseen struggle is raging far from view
39:47 - hidden away behind internet protocols
39:49 - and dial-up modems
39:51 - computers are facing their greatest
39:52 - threat since
39:53 - since the apple newton a new destructive
39:56 - virus disrupting digital services
39:59 - and quickly spreading the infection to
40:01 - the far reaches of the virtual world but
40:03 - who's behind it
40:04 - that's what you code breaker need to
40:05 - figure out
40:07 - along the way you'll meet other code
40:08 - breakers not unlike yourself
40:11 - okay i don't think we need to keep
40:12 - reading this
40:18 - file edit help
40:20 - help about the game surprises if you're
40:23 - stuck
40:24 - this game isn't for the faint-hearted
40:26 - all right we can't give up on this sean
40:31 - so if you're here don't fret you're not
40:32 - alone of course you need a little nudge
40:34 - in the right direction here a few things
40:35 - you can try to recruit a friend to
40:38 - unlock hints
40:39 - more code breakers you recruit the more
40:41 - hints you unlock
40:44 - some call it sneaky we call it a sure
40:46 - shot way to share the awesomeness
40:51 - so i guess if i were to like maybe share
40:53 - this with you
40:55 - i would get a better hint
41:02 - refresh current lists
41:07 - well no let's keep back with the hints
41:09 - we've just read
41:12 - okay
41:14 - so
41:15 - we got this misspelled one we know it's
41:18 - happy the oldies but goodies we know
41:21 - it's upgrade version
41:23 - and the clueless man
41:26 - it's together so maybe you do need to
41:28 - share it
41:29 - for something
41:32 - you have to do something together
41:38 - um
41:46 - so what does that mean go on twitter
41:49 - and discord or something and share it
41:51 - with you
41:54 - i'm not sure i don't know why it keeps
41:57 - saying the four million the songs 150
41:59 - 000 users
42:00 - your recruitment link
42:04 - look at that
42:09 - can i paste it
42:12 - why don't you try visiting this
42:16 - yeah i can try
42:17 - let me send it to you
42:26 - that is what we're supposed to find i
42:28 - think it said something about this six
42:30 - degrees thing i forgot what it was
42:33 - share your recruitment link get the most
42:35 - recruits and get awarded hint points and
42:37 - an ipad air
42:39 - i'll be
42:40 - that sounds worth it
42:42 - remember recruiting existing code
42:44 - breakers does not count
42:46 - points are only awarded after the
42:48 - referred person completes the signup
42:49 - processor
42:51 - recruitment points are reset for every
42:53 - drive
42:54 - the table below updates every four hours
42:59 - i think this is it we have to
43:02 - i have to have a recruit to do this
43:04 - maybe
43:05 - but there was still that the hint about
43:07 - the time
43:10 - said upgrade to the new millennium it's
43:11 - 10 p.m right now maybe we just need to
43:13 - wait two hours
43:16 - that has been ticking up slowly so
43:19 - there is the chance
43:37 - we could add your screen to the video
43:40 - maybe that just over complicates it what
43:43 - do you see do you see exactly what i see
43:46 - yeah no nothing looks different
43:50 - um
43:52 - wall street journal the mission is
