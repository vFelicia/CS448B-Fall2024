00:00 - let's talk a little bit more about how
00:02 - the internet works we've already
00:04 - established that every device and every
00:06 - other thing along the way in the
00:08 - internet has its own IP address now
00:11 - these IP addresses are assigned based on
00:14 - location using these IP addresses your
00:18 - device can talk to your modem which you
00:20 - probably have in your home then to a
00:22 - router which is set up by your web
00:24 - service the router would go to the
00:26 - domain name server this is still just
00:28 - sending a request now that domain name
00:30 - server would send back the information
00:32 - that was asked for and it would go right
00:34 - back to your device now you might think
00:37 - this is pretty fallible if one of these
00:39 - steps goes out the whole process is done
00:41 - but really there's so many more
00:44 - connections with so many routers and so
00:46 - many servers that if one huge chunk of
00:49 - the internet goes out that still won't
00:51 - really affect the functionality of
00:53 - anything else there are just infinite
00:55 - connections it's amazing now what I want
00:59 - you to take away from this video is that
01:01 - your device since it has its own IP
01:03 - address can send out a request for
01:06 - information that information is sent
01:08 - back to your device the way it gets to
01:10 - your device is because of the IP address
01:13 - and the way it gets there is through all
01:14 - the lines of the modems and routers and
01:16 - servers that make up the
01:18 - internet now that explanation of the
01:21 - internet is really really basic if
