00:05 - everybody welcome to live coding with
00:07 - Jessie today I am wearing my high school
00:10 - football jerseys
00:12 - we had a special day at work where you
00:17 - could wear a jeans and your favorite
00:19 - team's Jersey if you donated some money
00:23 - to a charity so I decided why not wear
00:28 - my Jersey because pretty much never ever
00:32 - have an appropriate occasion to wear it
00:35 - and when I say football I mean American
00:37 - football so for those of you from other
00:41 - countries
00:43 - I know football means would I call suck
00:48 - let's see oh I need to get my spot if I
00:52 - go in yesterday's throwback Thursday
00:58 - playlist was all 90s music which was
01:01 - really fun because I grew up in the 90s
01:08 - so maybe I'll just play that there we go
01:14 - let's listen to 90's music today in the
01:16 - background
01:29 - all right so today we're gonna work on
01:31 - some of the same stuff we were working
01:32 - on yesterday and we may switch it up and
01:36 - do some stuff on the homepage or you
01:38 - know maybe like in the app bar at the
01:40 - top we'll see how it goes
01:42 - I did get some some more data
01:49 - transferred over so I don't plan on
01:53 - making any more routes but if we could
01:57 - use that Universal component to check on
01:59 - some of that data then that'll be cool
02:01 - when then we can look at the styles for
02:02 - that and to say hi to everyone Nikki's
02:07 - here how's it going
02:08 - also Victor San bassist I like your
02:12 - Jersey thank you somebody says hey you
02:16 - play football in high school when we
02:18 - play cricket cool I've actually never
02:20 - played cricket before I've only seen it
02:22 - like in movies really it looks fun
02:26 - though
02:30 - John Hanson says it's a that's cool it's
02:33 - a good way to donate to charity yeah
02:37 - yeah it's cool we do that occasionally I
02:39 - think we have a day like that in
02:40 - Christmas where you bring in presence
02:43 - and then they they give it to local
02:45 - children who these families don't have
02:48 - enough money to buy presents for
02:50 - Christmas so we get like you can wear a
02:53 - Christmas sweater day let's see somebody
02:59 - says what charity I don't remember what
03:04 - it's called I gotta check the email I
03:08 - still haven't written my check yet for
03:11 - it so I need to look up the name anyway
03:14 - let's see oh it's gonna go to the
03:17 - scholarship fund so students who do not
03:21 - have enough money today to attend school
03:24 - here will get financial help so that's
03:27 - cool all right so let's let's get
03:35 - started I want to make sure I start my
03:37 - my timer oh and we can't go
03:41 - more than an hour and a half I have a
03:43 - meeting with my boss he wants a timeline
03:45 - for when everything's going to be done
03:47 - not only for this site but for some
03:49 - future projects and future additions to
03:51 - this site which I'll have to remember to
03:53 - tell you about today I said I was going
03:54 - to tell you yesterday and then I forgot
03:56 - so we can talk about that maybe later
04:01 - hopefully I won't forget again let's say
04:06 - I feel like I'm forgetting something but
04:10 - maybe maybe I'm not maybe I just didn't
04:12 - have a lot of stuff to say oh I know
04:14 - what it is I want to say thank you to
04:16 - Nikki for the pull request so as you all
04:22 - probably noticed if you've been watching
04:24 - for the last few days I keep having to
04:27 - restart the server manually every time
04:29 - we make a change in the server j/s file
04:32 - so now we're as Harshit suggested
04:39 - yesterday we're using node Mon to watch
04:44 - for changes on a server j/s file and
04:47 - automatically restart the server so
04:49 - it'll save a little bit of time it'll
04:51 - definitely save me some annoyance and
04:54 - anyways it's really cool so if you have
04:56 - the repo and you do a pool make sure you
04:59 - run yarn because we have some new NPM
05:02 - packages in there so it won't work
05:05 - otherwise but now it is kind of cool we
05:08 - don't need to manually restart all right
05:13 - Harsha thank you for reminding me to
05:15 - switch my screen there we are
05:18 - and so I may ask one question you like
05:23 - your boss I I do really like my boss yep
05:27 - I actually I knew my boss before I got
05:29 - the job here we're actually both
05:31 - officers in this non-pro I co-founded a
05:36 - non-profit here
05:38 - where I'm from and so he's our treasurer
05:41 - for that nonprofit organization so we
05:44 - kind of knew each other beforehand and
05:47 - now yeah I really like my boss so he's a
05:52 - good boss
05:53 - I like everybody my department is great
05:56 - it's really nice nice place all right
06:04 - Wow a lot going on there don't really
06:07 - need to see that there right now let's
06:10 - start your timer and get to work
06:19 - also let's go to the homepage No
06:22 - okay it is a link for a second I didn't
06:25 - think it was a link nothing was
06:26 - happening but so I just wanted to go
06:31 - here and show you all this is my boss
06:38 - Tom crow is my boss and that's his
06:41 - picture that's a pretty old picture but
06:43 - he still pretty much looks exactly the
06:45 - same
07:00 - all right
07:05 - so we're we had I honestly do not
07:10 - remember at all where we left off I
07:14 - think remind me if I'm wrong here
07:18 - correct me if I'm wrong here
07:20 - the last thing that we worked on were
07:23 - that was the size for H tags I think
07:29 - that's what we had done we had changed
07:31 - font sizes we changed some font weights
07:34 - and we were I we did art I I'm almost
07:38 - positive this was what we did yesterday
07:39 - and we kind of ended by testing that out
07:42 - and looking at the various fonts Jeff
07:47 - Miller thank you for reminding me about
07:50 - the end rot link let's get that started
08:05 - there we are and grok link is now in the
08:08 - live chat all right well since I'm on
08:15 - the home page right now let's just check
08:17 - the home page and see what's going on if
08:19 - there's anything that we really need to
08:21 - change you know style wise let's see and
08:28 - in case you you didn't watch the stream
08:31 - and we talked about this I want to do
08:32 - everything from a mobile point of view
08:36 - first and the we're gonna obviously pay
08:44 - attention to desktop view but I think
08:49 - this is the better way to go given our
08:51 - audience of you know mostly American
08:56 - teenagers as we can check let's check
09:03 - this out all right so here's something
09:04 - that I've been meaning to change for a
09:07 - while let's change the let's change the
09:15 - width first I'm going to make this side
09:18 - navigation drawer a little bit more
09:21 - narrow and I want to see how that looks
09:24 - and then potentially make change the
09:27 - width of this you see right now we have
09:30 - more space on this side than we do on
09:32 - this side so I don't want to change it
09:36 - yet I'm gonna wait and see what happens
09:38 - when we make this a little more narrow
09:44 - all right so we can just test it out in
09:48 - in dev tools here at first let's see let
09:54 - me get that container
10:04 - so with
10:11 - let's figure out where the width is I
10:15 - must be in a larger component maybe
10:28 - who a smaller one that's interesting
10:41 - hmm I'm gonna check this component
10:43 - because I'm not sure where that's coming
10:45 - in from let me make this font a bit
10:48 - bigger for everyone we can shrink this
10:51 - and let's check out our drawer component
11:02 - so I'm guessing it's some prop or
11:06 - something with is the list with 300
11:12 - interesting maybe it's just getting the
11:14 - width from the list or the list classes
11:23 - the list so this div is what's 300 okay
11:38 - just
11:45 - it's this diff okay now we can shrink it
11:52 - here oh okay I like that
11:57 - I like I like I don't like that it's a
12:00 - weird number but all right let's let's
12:03 - check it out
12:03 - I want to make sure it looks like
12:08 - everything will fit and it does look
12:10 - like everything will fit I like how all
12:15 - this looks the spacing is good I was
12:17 - hoping if that would happen that when we
12:19 - shrunk the drawer a bit that this would
12:21 - work itself out to save us a bit of time
12:25 - actually I really like that and I plan
12:28 - on decreasing the the indent decreasing
12:34 - the white space here so we'll actually
12:37 - have even more space for our menu items
12:40 - when we do that that that'll actually
12:42 - probably the next thing we work on so I
12:44 - want to keep the width here so let's go
12:46 - back to our component and up here this
12:51 - is gonna look a little bit different
12:52 - than your normal CSS right this is we're
12:56 - in a react component and then react
12:58 - components generally you'll you'll find
13:01 - a lot of different ways to do styles but
13:03 - one of the ways is to actually put it
13:05 - right in the component like this and so
13:07 - it's a it's a constant and it is a
13:10 - JavaScript object but we still use all
13:13 - the same names and properties as we do
13:16 - in CSS we just camelcase them or you
13:20 - know we put them it we make them strings
13:24 - so a little bit different but once you
13:28 - get used to you know putting thing
13:30 - making things strings camel casing and
13:32 - obviously using the you know correct
13:35 - formatting for an object it's basically
13:38 - the same as a normal CSS and we want to
13:41 - apply it down here well at least for the
13:43 - way we have this set up we just use
13:48 - class name equals and then we put
13:51 - brackets to denote we're using some
13:53 - JavaScript and then we just do that
13:55 - classes dot list
13:57 - remember it's an object so we're putting
14:00 - in near the classes object and then the
14:04 - list property right because if you see
14:08 - these this is like key values right we
14:11 - have lists but then in the value is
14:13 - another object what that contains a key
14:17 - value pair of with 300 right so we can
14:19 - use dot notation to grab that that value
14:23 - anyway so a little refresher or
14:26 - introduction depending on where you're
14:29 - at with your you know react training so
14:33 - anyway let's change this value so I
14:36 - believe we added at 265 and I'm not you
14:42 - know I'm not set on 265 but I'd like to
14:46 - try it out for a little bit and see how
14:48 - I like it
14:50 - and I do want to do a refresh just to
14:52 - make sure that that worked yep and that
14:58 - works
14:58 - okay now let's check out our items here
15:04 - what's that's interesting these are
15:06 - actually H threes
15:09 - very interesting and these are I don't
15:12 - believe that we made these age threes we
15:14 - can double check when we go back to the
15:16 - component but I think this was what they
15:19 - become in material UI it's really
15:23 - interesting all right so why is it
15:32 - that's this one right padding left 56
15:36 - whoa all right so I don't want to go all
15:41 - the way to 56 but I also don't want to
15:43 - be completely you know the other way so
15:45 - let's try a more reasonable padding of
15:50 - 16 pixels I think 16 is is way more
15:55 - reasonable all right wonderful
15:58 - I like 16 I think that looks looks
16:01 - really good
16:02 - and some of the items now are actually
16:05 - displaying on one line instead of two
16:08 - some of them are just too big we're not
16:10 - going to
16:10 - be able to fit them all on one line and
16:14 - that's okay all right I like that I like
16:20 - that all right so let's just figure out
16:22 - where this value is coming in at so it
16:24 - was that 50 something so let's check out
16:32 - this drawer new chair this drawer
16:36 - component we may need to go to the
16:39 - drawer item the leg drawer item themes
16:45 - facing padding left maybe it's here
16:48 - maybe this is where we're getting that
16:49 - value theme spacing unit times for all
16:58 - right where are we using this nested
17:12 - all right so it looks like we're only
17:14 - using nested on these ones so that
17:17 - shouldn't be the problem see these are
17:22 - the submenu items so this is the solicit
17:27 - item text this is really what we're
17:31 - dealing with here
17:34 - well what we wanted to change and expand
17:38 - this
17:51 - let's see maybe that's a default
17:58 - somewhere in material UI
18:13 - all right so we may just need to add in
18:18 - something here to override that default
18:21 - do I want to double check and see where
18:26 - that's that was at the second section
18:29 - said for sure
18:40 - all right so we're here h3
18:51 - I just got to figure out where exactly
18:54 - to put this Oh Lin Wang says use react
19:03 - for Chrome good idea let's check this
19:05 - out we got reacts yeah
19:22 - why am I not seeing anything there we
19:29 - are it's just nested very deeply
19:54 - this one might be a little bit more
19:57 - difficult to give get access to so
20:04 - anyway I you can see there's definitely
20:07 - a difference between what we see in our
20:09 - code so we have this a div that's
20:13 - containing this and then we have a list
20:15 - item and then this our list item text
20:19 - which this is probably where we can try
20:21 - to put it put our new padding value but
20:26 - then over here there there's a lot of
20:28 - other things happening here that get
20:30 - created by material UI so let's first
20:35 - try let's just try to put it here and we
20:39 - can do class name equals put in some
20:49 - brackets and we'll go classes dot list
20:56 - item will name it list item and then
21:00 - that way if we need to add any more
21:01 - classes we'll put it on there you know
21:03 - what we don't want this to be all this
21:05 - item let's call it
21:17 - are they gonna save parents parent list
21:22 - item okay that works yeah cuz we it's
21:29 - just a little bit more clear what we're
21:32 - we're putting these alright so we want
21:42 - to do padding-left of 16 pixels let's
21:52 - save that and check back over here let's
21:58 - go back to our elements here and see now
22:02 - we have that padding left well let's do
22:04 - a refresh to make sure we're not just
22:06 - getting the same same thing we put into
22:09 - dev tools nope and it did not work so
22:13 - let's find out if those Styles even got
22:15 - applied anywhere and if so where so we
22:19 - needed them to be applied here it looks
22:23 - like they did that we had a padding left
22:25 - of 16 here
22:34 - all right so if it's still being
22:37 - overridden so here's what we can do this
22:41 - is like we are definitely going to be
22:48 - able to override everything if we do
22:50 - this style to get rid of this add this
23:02 - in oops
23:22 - there we are
23:24 - alright so what's happened here and
23:26 - let's let's remove this before we forget
23:28 - and keep things clean so what we're
23:31 - doing here is adding in in inline style
23:42 - which if we know about CSS we know the
23:45 - inline styles and in that Cascade of
23:49 - what gets applied they're almost always
23:52 - applied over everything else the
23:54 - exception being if we want to use
23:55 - important with our Styles which we
23:58 - should use very very sparingly because
24:01 - it totally breaks the whole cascading
24:03 - nature of CSS oh I see we have Jeff Jeff
24:11 - put important in there too yeah it for
24:13 - sure and important importance like the
24:15 - next step if this doesn't work then we
24:17 - go too important but they're like levels
24:21 - of of how I how I override things so I
24:26 - don't want to jump there immediately
24:28 - unless I really need to yeah this one
24:32 - worked oh but we have issues still
24:50 - okay
25:07 - so before when we did 16 here it worked
25:14 - so I guess we're gonna have to put 16
25:20 - for these as well
25:22 - so I wonder now about this the nested
25:30 - stuff where's that nested class on the
25:34 - list item all right so it's not actually
25:39 - on the text part so this nested value
25:45 - basically what I'm seeing here is that
25:47 - we can put a padding value here that
25:49 - won't mess with this padding value so if
25:53 - we set this to 16 as well it should fix
25:56 - all of our issues so we can just copy
26:00 - and paste at this point all right I'm
26:02 - not gonna try to put it up in our normal
26:03 - styles because we know those will get
26:05 - overridden so let's put this here oops
26:13 - it Save
26:18 - great alright so that's the look that
26:22 - that we're really going for wonderful
26:32 - cool that looks good while we're at this
26:37 - point let's let's commit this because I
26:42 - think we're going to move on to
26:44 - something something different you know
26:48 - there's one more thing we can do for
26:50 - this list before we commit I saw I keep
26:54 - going the wrong way normally I always
26:55 - have my code to the right of the actual
26:59 - site in in chrome but for some reason I
27:03 - left this to the left and now it's
27:05 - messing me up so we had in our props for
27:13 - as a drawer now maybe it's at bar I
27:20 - search open searched
27:32 - did we bring it all the way up to layout
27:34 - I think we did right okay I do want to
27:39 - set all these by default to false so we
27:44 - had one is true for testing so I want to
27:48 - set those to false now so you don't have
27:50 - one of those menu items automatically
27:52 - open all right so now that we have that
28:00 - let's commit this this will do a git
28:04 - status just to verify that we've what
28:07 - we've changed George where item and
28:09 - layout that's good what did we changing
28:12 - drawer okay
28:17 - the width was what was in drawer all
28:19 - right it's always good to check just in
28:22 - case maybe you accidentally hit the
28:24 - keyboard didn't realize it and change
28:26 - the component you don't want to change
28:27 - you don't want to commit that and then
28:29 - have to undo it and mess up you know you
28:33 - end up having a couple commits for
28:35 - something that shouldn't have had a
28:37 - commit at all all right so we're gonna
28:40 - do a git add and I'm just gonna put a
28:43 - little dot there little period and that
28:44 - means we'll add everything and now this
28:48 - is something different we're gonna do
28:50 - yarn CM and that's been set up
28:54 - who did that did Nicky do that or was
28:57 - that on though let me know I can't
29:00 - remember who did that I know I think it
29:02 - was Nicky's idea anyway we're new to
29:09 - yarn see them and when I hit enter
29:12 - you'll see in a second this is gonna
29:15 - walk a user through or developer through
29:18 - the steps to make a well formatted
29:22 - commit message so this is going to make
29:27 - the commit log be more meaningful and
29:31 - it'll be a lot easier for someone just
29:33 - to just quickly you know kind of look
29:36 - through the commit log and find what
29:39 - they want so this will say this is a new
29:45 - feature
29:46 - most of the things that we do are our
29:48 - new features and you can enter the scope
29:52 - this is not mandatory I'm gonna skip it
29:55 - for now but you could answer you know
29:57 - what is this effect what we're component
30:02 - then this is this is not optional we
30:05 - need to write a short description so in
30:08 - this case we're going to do narrow the
30:17 - drawer and
30:32 - so I'll miss em saying there the drawer
30:34 - and decrease left padding for drawer
30:36 - menu alright so something like that it's
30:39 - just straightforward let somebody know
30:42 - what happened we don't need a huge
30:44 - description here if you want to provide
30:47 - a more in-depth description you can do
30:51 - that here on the next line but you can
30:54 - also skip this I usually skip it if I
30:56 - did something that was really
30:58 - complicated then maybe I might think
31:02 - about putting it in here especially I
31:07 - mean if you're going to do a pull
31:09 - request you're probably going to
31:11 - describe it anyway but just you know for
31:13 - future people that might be maintaining
31:15 - it if it's potentially confusing then
31:19 - try to explain it in this case these
31:22 - changes are pretty minor and
31:24 - straightforward so probably not needed
31:26 - are there any breaking changes no not
31:30 - that I know of does this affect any open
31:33 - issues I think it does maybe it doesn't
31:38 - I can't remember if I made an issue let
31:40 - me look at the issues for this repo so
31:44 - our current is we have five issues
31:47 - looking and commit missus formation is
31:50 - an occupation no it actually isn't so I
31:54 - guess I never made this an issue it was
31:56 - just an issue in my mind so it doesn't
32:00 - affect any open issues now it's gonna
32:05 - run our Auto formatting linting all our
32:09 - tests and now it's going to open up
32:14 - Chrome and make sure things are running
32:17 - in the page correctly so we don't have
32:19 - full test coverage right now if we did
32:23 - the test would take a lot longer but
32:25 - right now everything's passing which is
32:26 - great and the final step then is to do
32:29 - is git commit I'm sorry get push we're
32:36 - going to say origin and that's
32:37 - automatically gonna push to our master
32:39 - branch and there we are now all this is
32:42 - available at the repo description
32:44 - the link is in the description if you
32:47 - want to check that out
32:50 - alright I'm gonna check the time before
32:53 - we go on hmm I have no time did I
32:57 - remember to start that what time is it
32:59 - yeah that makes sense with the time okay
33:03 - somehow I just didn't notice the beeping
33:06 - that was happening okay let me go back
33:10 - to the live chat I'm gonna take a five
33:12 - minute break and go through and read
33:14 - what's in the live chat and answer any
33:15 - questions that might be there some bias
33:26 - if there's any live for Android studio I
33:29 - I don't know if there's I'm assuming
33:36 - you're asking if there's a live stream
33:37 - for Android studio I don't know of any
33:39 - live streams for Android studio if if
33:42 - any of you know about that please
33:44 - let us know in the live chat below she
33:49 - asks to make proper playlists please I
33:52 - know I know it's it's on my list of
33:54 - things to do I'm just been I've been
33:57 - really busy and I've been doing my
33:59 - trying to do my best to not do a lot of
34:01 - work at home and to be with my four kids
34:04 - I'm just really trying to enjoy them
34:07 - while they're still young and be there
34:09 - for them I've been working a little bit
34:15 - extra lately for to get this project
34:17 - done
34:18 - I still have clients and then now I have
34:20 - this JavaScript AF side project going
34:24 - which I'm not really doing that much
34:28 - coding it's more like I don't know like
34:31 - Direction management stuff for that
34:34 - which between all of it it's just a lot
34:39 - right now so I really really understand
34:42 - why you want proper playlists and I
34:45 - think it's important and I will try to
34:47 - get that done at at some point
34:54 - Evan yuan says hello and it says as a
34:59 - front-end developer in Shanghai China
35:01 - now it's 1 a.m. Wow well thanks for
35:04 - staying up and watching so late I really
35:06 - appreciate that
35:09 - Brooke says add a max width percentage
35:11 - to the drawer so it's bigger on larger
35:13 - screens but only takes a certain portion
35:16 - of the screen maximum yeah I would yeah
35:24 - actually that's a good idea
35:33 - now that I've done it like this I don't
35:35 - I'm gonna leave it like this for now
35:37 - when we do check it out and see how it
35:39 - looks on a large screen if it looks
35:40 - weird because it's so narrow then we'll
35:42 - go with the max width percentage but
35:44 - that probably would have been a better
35:46 - solution than what I did so sorry I
35:48 - didn't look over Nikki and and see that
35:51 - suggestion earlier John Hanson says I
35:56 - would still like to see an X even if it
35:58 - sits in the backdrop better you actually
36:00 - I oh yeah yeah for sure
36:02 - so John Hanson is is talking about in
36:08 - the side nav having an X here we can do
36:13 - an X what we could do like an arrow
36:16 - pointing this way either one I'll have
36:20 - to see what is more common maybe I'll
36:23 - check some other material design style
36:26 - sites and then that way when you use
36:27 - your clicks at it also makes this go
36:30 - here you know that maybe I'll make an
36:33 - issue for that I don't think I really
36:35 - want to get into that right now
36:37 - on the stream because it's it's not a
36:41 - style thing it's more of a function
36:43 - thing at this point this stream is going
36:45 - to be more just style based so maybe
36:48 - I'll make an issue for that or John if
36:49 - you want to you can make an issue and
36:51 - we'll just add that in if someone else
36:55 - makes an issue for at first a really
36:57 - helpful thing to do would be to maybe
36:58 - screenshot a website that has something
37:00 - like that just to give a visual example
37:04 - you know especially this
37:06 - people from all over the world that are
37:07 - reading you know that are watching and
37:11 - reading what's in the repo so if English
37:15 - isn't their first language might not be
37:17 - that good with it an image I think is
37:19 - way more helpful to be able to get okay
37:24 - that's what what is meant here so anyway
37:27 - I think being able to add an image into
37:30 - an issue you know whenever possible I
37:33 - think is a good idea
37:34 - I don't want to make sure you just
37:39 - smiling or something though I'm sure
37:41 - you're all beautiful but I mean like an
37:43 - image of a website let's see Lin Wang
37:51 - says what are you doing help somebody to
37:53 - change UI yeah we're chant we're
37:56 - developing a website and today I was
37:58 - just gonna work on the UI part of the
38:01 - site
38:07 - Shu mam says create angular apps and
38:10 - then also added something descriptive
38:14 - how it's I'm not gonna say well yeah we
38:20 - just we don't do angular apps right now
38:22 - we're even no one reacts nothing against
38:24 - angular I know you know people that are
38:27 - great developers are using angular but
38:30 - you know we just on this dream we're
38:33 - focusing mainly on react so I'd rather
38:35 - focus on react right now and get really
38:37 - good at it maybe we use angular someday
38:40 - I'm not sure but I don't think if we
38:45 - have other videos we may have angular
38:48 - videos on the channel I can't remember
38:51 - offhand though if we have
38:57 - I can see y'all thought I was gonna use
39:02 - important huh I didn't have to this time
39:05 - I controlled myself and I didn't dump
39:07 - jump straight to using important Lin
39:10 - Wayne says where can I see your code the
39:13 - link is in the description to this video
39:15 - a little take you right to the repo and
39:17 - you can see to all the code well Jeff
39:24 - Miller just gave the same answer thank
39:25 - you Jeff I appreciate it I didn't see
39:27 - that first oh okay look that's awesome
39:39 - so Nikki's is Nikki is is rook so if I
39:42 - you hear me use those words it's the
39:44 - same person so Nikki says just press
39:48 - enter on the guests are no questions to
39:50 - pick the default the default is with the
39:52 - capital letter so not sure why didn't
39:56 - pick up on that it seems really obvious
39:58 - right now after you said that so whoops
40:02 - wrong way but Lee when we were up here I
40:06 - actually typed in the N and I probably
40:13 - did not have to assuming the end was the
40:16 - capitalized one thanks for letting me
40:19 - know I'll actually really really
40:22 - appreciate just being able to hit enter
40:24 - now all right
40:31 - one last question before we go back and
40:34 - do some more coding Nikki says what is
40:36 - good github issue etiquette asking
40:39 - because the issue I created on this site
40:41 - has the worst title effort and I also
40:43 - don't know if I should close the commits
40:46 - discussion okay I'm no expert in
40:51 - etiquette so I'm just going to say what
40:53 - I prefer
40:54 - as someone who maintains you know
40:57 - repositories try to be descriptive but
41:01 - very brief in your in the title for your
41:09 - commits so
41:10 - I mean you may even want to start out
41:12 - and put like bug : and then say what it
41:16 - is or if something like that just try to
41:21 - be as descriptive as you can check out -
41:25 - if a repository has information on what
41:30 - they want then definitely follow that
41:31 - not every post where he does some do but
41:35 - just in general keep that short and
41:38 - descriptive and then in your actual
41:39 - description you can go into more depth
41:42 - include as much info as you can
41:44 - screenshots help as well if that applies
41:46 - and when it comes to closing it
41:50 - if someone submits a pull request that
41:54 - fixes it then it should be closed if for
41:57 - some reason it doesn't get closed when
41:59 - that happens then if you create an issue
42:01 - you're probably safe to go and close it
42:03 - if it's just a discussion if let's say
42:09 - the discussion comes to a conclusion
42:10 - where decision is made I'd say you're
42:13 - probably safe to close that as well yeah
42:21 - if let's say you ask a question and it's
42:24 - no longer relevant like you found the
42:26 - answer you realize your question was
42:28 - unnecessary if it was answered elsewhere
42:31 - you can close it that you know that's
42:34 - going to be kind of a judgement call
42:36 - type of thing you whether or not you
42:38 - want to close it I think and if if worse
42:41 - comes to worse you could always you know
42:44 - just say hey any objections if I close
42:47 - this right I'm pretty easygoing when it
42:51 - comes to my repos at some repos the
42:55 - maintainer --zz it's hard to tell tone
42:57 - from just from text but the maintainer
42:59 - seemed a little bit irritated so
43:05 - sometimes that happens you know just
43:08 - kind of realize they probably are
43:09 - dealing with a ton of issues all the
43:11 - time so I'm sure it gets frustrating but
43:17 - anyway that's what that's my advice for
43:20 - for github issues
43:23 - I'm sure there's probably a guide out
43:24 - there that doesn't much better job than
43:26 - then I just stated explaining all all
43:28 - that okay let's go back what were you
43:45 - doing alright so we just finished up
43:50 - with some things in this side nav now
44:05 - let's look oh I know what I want to do I
44:08 - mentioned yesterday that I definitely
44:12 - want to increase the white space here at
44:18 - the top of this logo so let's do that
44:21 - now
44:36 - yeah I definitely just want to grab do
44:38 - it for this image or the span that's
44:42 - containing it I don't want it to extend
44:43 - any further like to this container
44:46 - because I I really like how this is
44:49 - vertically centered here you know what
44:55 - actually now that I think of it this is
44:58 - going to increase the height of
44:59 - everything so maybe it should be on the
45:01 - the container alright we'll mess around
45:09 - with it and see which would will be the
45:11 - best to do if I can do a bit here just
45:18 - to see so we'll do a padding top I
45:24 - padding more margin would work here it's
45:27 - not gonna make a difference and let's
45:29 - try eight pixels first see this what I
45:33 - was afraid of is that it would throw off
45:35 - this so eight I wouldn't go any more
45:43 - than eight here I don't know what you
45:44 - all think but eight pixels almost seems
45:46 - like too much space to me I'm thinking
45:51 - six I
45:54 - I like six a lot more let's go with six
46:00 - usually eights my minimum for that kind
46:02 - of thing but it just looks way too big
46:09 - now let's take it off of here and try
46:12 - putting it on our container padding top
46:21 - six pixels there we are that looks a lot
46:26 - nicer in terms of our icon so let's try
46:34 - to take that six pixels of padding on
46:38 - the top you know let's let's extend this
46:43 - as well just to make sure it's not
46:47 - messing anything else
46:54 - yeah we have some weirdness going on on
46:57 - the desktop so we'll get to that next
47:00 - first let's get this sorted out all
47:07 - right so this is most likely in the app
47:09 - bar component so let's check that out
47:16 - icon all right so the icon and the image
47:24 - are inside of this div we already have a
47:27 - class on it this is given the class of
47:31 - column one I don't think that's what we
47:38 - want though we want the whole thing
47:40 - right that's what we that's what we did
47:43 - so is it toolbar there's a toolbar and
47:52 - let me just do this
47:58 - all right so toolbar pretty much does
48:01 - there's everything so let's add the
48:04 - class name Oh actually app bar already
48:07 - has a class as well we could just add to
48:10 - that yeah let's just add to app bar
48:15 - since the class already exists it'll
48:17 - save us a bit of time just go
48:22 - padding-top oops
48:24 - need to camelcase that and six pixels
48:31 - we'll save it and give it a refresh all
48:38 - right great
48:38 - so that works we have our padding
48:47 - awesome I keep an eye on the time
48:51 - all right looks like we're good we'll be
48:53 - able to finish out this I'll keep an eye
48:55 - on the live chat too if there's not a
48:57 - lot of questions then we can definitely
49:00 - finish out this Pomodoro cycle if there
49:04 - are a lot of questions I might end a
49:06 - little early so I can get the questions
49:07 - in before my meeting all right great
49:13 - so we've got it working now I'm sorry
49:18 - we've got it looking better now on a
49:20 - small screen now I would like to switch
49:25 - it to a larger screen and see what we
49:30 - can do about this is it's not at all
49:33 - what I would like to see whoops all
49:39 - right so there's just way too much space
49:43 - here unnecessary and then it's causing a
49:48 - lot of unnecessary space here I think
49:50 - that size of that logo is fine I don't
49:53 - want to make this huge to somehow like
49:55 - make up for this I think that would just
50:00 - cause another problem of having a logo
50:02 - of too big so let's try to decrease that
50:05 - space in here so let's figure out where
50:07 - that space is coming from first oh think
50:11 - this is it let's check that line height
50:14 - I mean it could just be regular height I
50:19 - suppose 72 where is it getting there
50:29 - all right so let's dig down a bit
50:39 - okay definitely not from within here to
50:45 - go up that's odd that's really odd
51:00 - I mean we can obviously get rid of some
51:02 - padding that would be fine but the
51:08 - height is just still just too tall yeah
51:17 - and our line ID here is just is not
51:26 - yeah the line nights not really even
51:28 - affecting that space alright we might
51:36 - just have to set a height then on this
51:38 - div so let's try that out
51:43 - let's go heights and let's just set 30
51:51 - pixels there we are interesting let's
52:04 - see what it looks like now
52:12 - all right let me see I'm gonna go back
52:15 - to the live chat and see if anyone has
52:19 - mentioned a better solution okay Nicki
52:26 - good thought the Nicki says that maybe
52:31 - it's the search bar that's causing the
52:33 - height issue I like that idea I did not
52:37 - even think about that but I I'm pretty
52:40 - sure that you're right about that so
52:42 - let's check out the search bar
53:01 - see
53:27 - maybe not Nikki I really thought that
53:30 - that would have been it but I'm not I'm
53:32 - not seeing extra height therefore the
53:35 - search
55:03 - okay if we
55:21 - all right so if we take away
55:23 - display:block from these then it
55:29 - actually but it bumps this up a little
55:32 - bit and definitely makes that smaller
55:36 - overall I just want to see if there's if
55:41 - there are any side effects that are
55:43 - happening if we do that that we don't
55:46 - want one thing I notice is that these
55:48 - are now spaced out a lot farther which
55:54 - it looks like that could be changed if
55:59 - we get rid of our or margin okay so
56:08 - that's that's better I still want to
56:10 - have a margin over here I guess but it
56:13 - may be better to actually put that on
56:15 - the search and it it would be easier
56:21 - okay hmm
56:35 - we may be able to Center these
56:48 - it's gonna work
56:51 - now let's put it on the do we not have a
56:57 - ul we just have allies all right
57:12 - okay guess it's not gonna work
57:19 - is okay
57:29 - all right well that's that's I guess a
57:32 - first step let me go to the live chat
57:35 - and see what you all think
57:39 - well John says do you think the
57:42 - hamburger so this icon here could be
57:47 - visually bigger the click size is 48 by
57:50 - 48 which is very good the problem is the
57:53 - UI seems to control that hamburger it's
57:56 - visual size
58:05 - yes you're right yeah the the click area
58:08 - is actually bigger than the size here
58:12 - yeah I'm open to maybe changing the size
58:16 - of this I'd go look before I change it
58:20 - I'd like to check the material design
58:23 - documentation and see if there's a
58:25 - standard size that we should use okay
58:35 - well let's let's go down this hole here
58:37 - let's go down this path and see what
58:40 - happens if we try to remove this block
58:46 - this display block from all these a tags
58:51 - and and it will go from there so it
58:57 - looks like the only real issue is the
59:01 - the spacing and I think we can deal with
59:04 - that my music ended I'm so used to
59:10 - having music on when I'm coding that it
59:12 - just becomes really weird without it so
59:18 - I'm gonna get something else on here
59:19 - quickly
59:35 - all right I have so many messages on my
59:40 - phone I don't understand
59:53 - okay so let's get this over to a
59:56 - component
60:04 - display:block
60:12 - all right so in line is now the display
60:15 - I suppose it's worth it to try to go
60:20 - through a few of these values first
60:42 - inline-block actually looks pretty good
60:47 - so does inline flex and I grid alright
60:57 - any reason that I should do something
60:59 - else
61:00 - so basically ever these inline-block
61:04 - flex and grid are all looking pretty
61:06 - good let me know if there's some reason
61:11 - why I should go with one or the other
61:12 - I'm just gonna default to inline block
61:14 - for now alright so let's find these a
61:21 - tags see if we can put change their
61:25 - display to inline block so we're
61:32 - probably here at a power menu item I
61:38 - believe this is the component that we
61:40 - want
61:47 - I'm sorry I meant to say style this this
61:52 - you link ul link class and this tell
62:02 - live for the margin you want to take
62:06 - that away so for now let me just make it
62:10 - zero because I don't want to completely
62:12 - remove it in case we need to put it back
62:14 - in give it a refresh all right not bad
62:32 - not bad definitely it it messes it does
62:38 - mess up a little with the positioning of
62:43 - this search icon so now the search icon
62:45 - appears to be a little tall we may be
62:48 - able to solve that simply by making this
62:51 - icon a little bigger which I think would
62:54 - be fine so but that'll be the next step
63:01 - first let's shrink it make sure it fits
63:11 - okay all right cool looks like
63:14 - everything fits and let's see we still
63:20 - have a space here more space than I
63:22 - really want
63:33 - oh did it not get applied is that why we
63:38 - have that space cursor for any kind of
63:42 - automatic station on that's weird
63:59 - it should have been there we are I think
64:03 - I got applied this son yep it was
64:06 - applied this time display:inline-block
64:10 - alright so now we've kind of filled that
64:14 - gap here which is good this could maybe
64:19 - be a bit tighter here but I think that's
64:23 - acceptable and let's work on this
64:29 - this search icon let's make the search
64:32 - icon a bit bigger and give it some left
64:35 - margin or padding and maybe and maybe we
64:42 - can move on and do something with these
64:44 - search icons and this button here I
64:47 - think I'd like to change a little bit
64:49 - about how this looks
64:51 - let's see all right we're not gonna be
64:55 - able to do all that I just yeah I won't
64:58 - have time to do all that but let me know
65:00 - what you think I don't I don't know that
65:04 - I really like this button being here I
65:06 - think it might be better to have just
65:09 - text but maybe accented in a different
65:12 - color so we know it's clickable I I
65:14 - don't know I think it's too much it's
65:16 - just too much right here I don't think
65:19 - we need to highlight this that much it
65:21 - just takes users to access
65:23 - FUS so it's essentially like a login
65:26 - button but it's not even for our primary
65:33 - audience this is for internal audience
65:39 - it comes my usual time of day to start
65:42 - yawning all right okay well we're not
65:49 - gonna have time to work on that anyway
65:50 - but we just kind of think about what
65:52 - might work let's shake this up it's our
65:57 - SVG
66:01 - all right yeah let's take our SVG man
66:05 - let's do a oops padding-left
66:15 - and let's try eight pixels I like it a
66:21 - pixels looks pretty good let's also see
66:25 - if we can add if we can increase the
66:28 - size here so let's go height and I don't
66:36 - know 25 pixels width 25 pixels and this
66:47 - is not 35
67:02 - is it not actually increasing there we
67:05 - are I said it said too low
67:24 - alright that gives us a click area of 40
67:28 - by 40 which is still a little small but
67:32 - remember this is not going to be visible
67:36 - on mobile so in terms of just the click
67:39 - with the mouse this is fine if we wanted
67:41 - to have something be clickable on a
67:44 - mobile device on a touchscreen device
67:46 - you you want it to be like definitely
67:49 - above 40 I'm sure I think what the
67:51 - standard is is it 48 by 48 essentially
67:56 - you want it to be clickable with
67:57 - somebody's thumb especially if somebody
67:59 - has a larger thumb so that's why you
68:01 - want to make sure you have a large click
68:03 - area you don't want two people to
68:05 - accidentally click the wrong thing or
68:07 - something like that but I think this is
68:09 - okay let's just see I would like it to
68:14 - be slightly higher so I wonder how we
68:17 - can accomplish that the best
68:26 - nice will padding-bottom but you know
68:31 - what that definitely adds it adds more
68:33 - than I want to the bottom here yeah
68:45 - I don't yeah only I want that it adds
68:48 - too much let's see what else we can do
68:59 - Hey
69:02 - there we go we change the heights it
69:05 - looks like now that's not see that's
69:12 - just not enough of a change I think
69:20 - yeah it's we retire like a one pixel
69:23 - change I need like a 4 pixel change here
69:26 - I think I'm I'm at a time for this one
69:31 - so let's let's grab what worked so we
69:35 - definitely want that padding and we want
69:37 - it to be a bit bigger so let's just grab
69:39 - this for now and they can work on the
69:41 - rest at another time
69:44 - so in
69:50 - I guess forget the Atbara menu item no
69:56 - that's it it would it would be an app
69:57 - bar right yeah SVG style so I'm gonna
70:06 - paste that even though I know it's not
70:07 - you know how it's supposed to work
70:11 - we'll just convert it a little bit here
70:32 - save that and oh we already had a thing
70:39 - with huh interesting
70:45 - all right let's take this out for now
70:48 - and just have our padding that was the
70:54 - most important thing okay one refresh
70:59 - just to make sure that that worked no
71:04 - and it did not didn't work
71:18 - hmm yeah actually it looks like none of
71:23 - that is being applied hmm all right this
71:29 - is something you know what this is I
71:34 - wish I didn't have a meeting all right
71:36 - I'll have to work on this later on yeah
71:41 - so normally I would go a little bit
71:43 - longer and fix this but I have a meeting
71:45 - so let me check the live chat see if
71:47 - I've got all the questions and then yeah
71:51 - we're getting it kind of close to
71:53 - meeting time so it's a try using flexbox
71:58 - a line item Center all right okay yeah
72:02 - that's a good idea for that vertical
72:04 - line
72:06 - Thanks up and some condition flexbox can
72:10 - ignore inline block okay
72:13 - Oh Saad says what if you outline the
72:16 - button with the green color yeah that's
72:20 - a great idea I'll have to try that well
72:23 - then I'm gonna try very hard to remember
72:25 - that and try it on that button I I think
72:29 - that might end up looking really nice
72:31 - yeah that's that's a really good idea
72:38 - Oliver says what about tablets Oliver
72:41 - you're right you know what a tablet
72:43 - might be big enough to that this would
72:45 - show up on that's a good point
72:47 - all right so I should definitely keep
72:48 - that in mind that we want this to be
72:50 - clickable even like like touchable even
72:53 - with someone's thumb good thinking I
72:57 - love these strings because you all have
73:00 - these ideas and you know what I just I
73:02 - don't think about those you know maybe
73:04 - eventually I might think of one or two
73:06 - of those things but there's no way I'm
73:07 - going to think of all the stuff that you
73:09 - all think of too anyway I really
73:13 - appreciate all the help
73:17 - Blake ass has any one worked with react
73:20 - on Rails if so is it easier or harder
73:22 - than playing reacts all right so yeah
73:24 - Blake um you probably know I've never
73:27 - worked with rails before so I definitely
73:28 - can't answer that maybe someone else has
73:30 - has worked
73:31 - that and and can let Blake know in the
73:33 - live chat all right so Brooke saying
73:41 - that pretty sure that space was not
73:45 - there before the search bar was added so
73:47 - maybe it did have something to do with a
73:49 - search bar in any case I think we're
73:54 - getting we're getting close to a pretty
73:56 - decent solution here so I think we'll be
73:58 - alright and we won't even have to really
73:59 - mess with a search bar too much just
74:01 - want to kind of get this stuff moved up
74:03 - a bit and get this the proper size and
74:07 - click area all right well Matt the end
74:10 - of the live chat now and it was somewhat
74:13 - of a shortish a mime a word in an hour
74:15 - and 14 minutes so I guess it wasn't that
74:17 - short just went by quickly for me but we
74:20 - did get some things done we got that
74:24 - side drawers looking nice I mean that's
74:26 - as far as I'm concerned that's ready to
74:29 - launch that looks good and then this app
74:32 - bar at the top it's getting there it's
74:35 - getting there it's not this is not
74:37 - launch ready in my mind but it's close
74:40 - so anyway it's Friday have a wonderful
74:47 - weekend I'll see you all back on Monday
74:50 - Monday the stream is probably gonna be a
74:52 - little later than normal it's going to
74:55 - be tough I don't know what time I can
74:57 - stream because I have an appointment I
75:00 - have like appointments during my normal
75:04 - stream time and then after we'll see
75:07 - I'll try my best to stream on Monday but
75:10 - Monday and Tuesday I it'll definitely be
75:12 - different times than normal because of
75:15 - meetings and things so just a heads up
75:18 - on that I'll let everyone know on
75:21 - Twitter and I'll try to schedule as
75:23 - early as possible so y'all get a heads
75:24 - up okay Nicki says friendly push
75:28 - reminder okay cool yeah I will push this
75:31 - I kind of wanted to get it fixed before
75:33 - I pushed it but I think I'll just push
75:35 - it so you have it all I'll do that
75:36 - though as soon as I end the stream and
75:41 - yeah so anyway again have a great
75:44 - weekend I'll be back on Monday hopefully

75:50 - weekend again but that would be silly
