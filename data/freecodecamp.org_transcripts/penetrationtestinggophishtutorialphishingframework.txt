00:00 - everyone just not going to waste a lot
00:02 - of time in theory but want to explain
00:04 - what you should expect from this course
00:06 - now basically we will be covering how do
00:10 - you do phishing attacks or how do you
00:12 - manage phishing campaigns for a
00:14 - corporate penetration test in real life
00:18 - okay and how do you do that with one of
00:20 - the most advanced phishing frameworks in
00:22 - the world which is known as Go Fish
00:24 - now you need to understand one thing by
00:27 - doovy to penetration testing assessments
00:30 - that contains a social engineering when
00:33 - you go and see one of the NIST special
00:35 - publications that is 800 - one one five
00:38 - one of my favorite publications this has
00:41 - been outdated a little bit but you can
00:43 - see it has almost 80 pages and it gives
00:47 - you a lot of glance on how you should
00:50 - perform a penetration test earlier life
00:52 - in addition tests so here you will see
00:55 - they have social engineering it should
00:59 - be in this 15.3 social engineering so
01:03 - when you go ahead and open these social
01:06 - engineering aspects which is right here
01:08 - you will understand that social
01:12 - engineering simply attempts to trick
01:15 - someone to reveal the information that's
01:17 - what it is okay that's what it is
01:18 - generally we are trying to get some of
01:21 - the information which comes in the act
01:24 - of reconnaissance phase through social
01:25 - engineering otherwise we are trying to
01:28 - gain access which comes in beginning
01:30 - access phase right sometimes can get
01:33 - extended to the maintaining access space
01:35 - where we are trying to expand our reach
01:37 - through social engineering we are
01:39 - already in the system and we want to
01:41 - attack other systems so we may apply
01:42 - social engineering the most common ways
01:45 - social engineering is utilized you can
01:47 - see where here is one form of digital
01:49 - social engineering is known as efficient
01:51 - so that's what we generally do phishing
01:53 - is your first line of attack right you
01:56 - always start social engineering by the
01:59 - way of fishing because even a focus on a
02:02 - mass audience right and that's why you
02:04 - need a dashboard you need a software
02:06 - application to manage your phishing
02:09 - attack your fishing camping now social
02:12 - engineering may also be
02:13 - used to target high-value individuals
02:16 - generally you know different names given
02:18 - as veiling spearfishing extrados castas
02:21 - but the basic idea is when you are doing
02:23 - a corporate level fishing you cannot
02:26 - just use those little tools like social
02:29 - engineering toolkit exact right sector
02:31 - you can only use those tools and perform
02:33 - a corporate level social engineering
02:35 - attack right you cannot use those in
02:36 - professional penetration testing you
02:38 - need something bigger and that is why I
02:40 - am going to show you how go fish can
02:44 - help you with that
02:44 - listen open-source fishing framework and
02:47 - it's one of the best frameworks I have
02:50 - ever used in all of my penetration tests
02:52 - that are related to physical security or
02:54 - social engineering assessments and the
02:56 - main thing is we are not going to do it
02:58 - on a local host which most of the other
03:01 - people are teaching that's very
03:03 - impractical we set up a live server that
03:06 - runs a website that has this framework
03:09 - this dashboard as well as that has SSL
03:13 - so you never get caught with the HTTP
03:16 - connections you will be spoofing your
03:18 - email to send the phishing campaigns and
03:21 - it's very very practical what you see in
03:23 - the real life right so I hope you're
03:25 - very interested with this let's go ahead
03:27 - and cover the scores on Go Fish and
03:29 - let's get started
03:30 - we will grab the go fish framework which
03:33 - will allow us to do phishing attacks
03:35 - really simply and it will give us a lot
03:38 - of power as compared to other possible
03:40 - ways so coffee is a really great
03:43 - framework written in the go language so
03:45 - you can just go to like you can directly
03:49 - go to get go fish comm or you can either
03:52 - search for that so the search for go
03:57 - fish here you will get the get go fish
04:00 - dot-com which is for the download and
04:02 - here's the github repository if you want
04:04 - to check that out but let's just go
04:06 - ahead and grab the garbage framework now
04:09 - here you can just click on download
04:13 - and depending upon the system which you
04:15 - are using you can download the right one
04:18 - here we have the 64-bit or a dog okay
04:24 - there is the Linux 64-bit in my case you
04:27 - may download depending upon what you are
04:28 - using here so let me download it
04:34 - let's save this I'll
04:38 - now on to the stonewalling let's go back
04:40 - and you can just see here I launched it
04:43 - camping in three steps so you can see
04:45 - how clear interface this is right here
04:48 - in this image how clear and a good Anna
04:51 - like structure it'll give you so it's a
04:54 - really good panel I have used it a lot
04:55 - and let's just go ahead and see if
04:58 - download has completed so it's about ten
05:01 - seconds
05:04 - is this thing
05:07 - Oh
05:09 - so it has been downloaded yeah just in
05:14 - yeah and let's open this up
05:17 - and you will find the raw fish so let's
05:22 - drag this thing on the desktop depending
05:24 - upon where you want you can just have it
05:26 - anywhere it has been extracted to
05:28 - complete and now we don't need the
05:30 - browser anymore here I would like to
05:33 - rename it to go fish I don't like long
05:36 - names
05:38 - oh here it is
05:41 - now here I've got the coffee framework
05:43 - and let's see what are the files in this
05:46 - so here is the readme file if you want
05:49 - here is the configuration file in the
05:51 - interrogation file if you just open it
05:53 - up you can setup the ports so let me
05:56 - show you guys that thing here are the
05:59 - go-fish listening port here it will
06:01 - listen and here are the go fish channel
06:06 - server panel main server port so if you
06:09 - want you can change this board 80 and 3
06:10 - 3 3 3 if you want it just all about on
06:15 - you that this our go fish is and to run
06:18 - go fish you just need to run this file
06:20 - here with the terminal and that's all so
06:22 - I'll see in the next lecture we will we
06:25 - will just go ahead and explore go fish
06:27 - we will learn this server and we'll see
06:29 - what you can do with the coefficient how
06:31 - it looks so thank you so much for
06:32 - watching
06:33 - welcome back everyone in this lecture we
06:35 - will go ahead and start the Go Fish
06:37 - server so in last lecture we just
06:40 - downloaded this all folder and it sounds
06:43 - simple to launch corphish you just open
06:45 - it in a terminal and it's just the
06:47 - running the go fish script here so it's
06:50 - the full stop and then a power slash go
06:54 - fish and this press enter it will start
06:56 - the coffee server you can see starting
06:58 - go fits over add this and go fish the
07:01 - admin server add port this let's go
07:04 - ahead and check that out
07:05 - I'll open Firefox here
07:11 - and let's go ahead and check that
07:14 - 127.0.0.1 port number three three three
07:18 - three let's press ENTER now if you get
07:21 - this kind of error nothing here and here
07:24 - the error is like the GDP Heelys
07:28 - handshake error so the first record does
07:31 - not match looks like a TLS handshake now
07:34 - what do you want to do is that make sure
07:36 - you are not running is it on HTTP you
07:38 - need to run it on HTTPS so HTTPS sorry
07:43 - then colon forward slash forward slash
07:46 - and this press enter and here it should
07:48 - Lord if it gives you a security warning
07:50 - no matters it's your local port just add
07:53 - a security exception right out there
07:57 - here is the place Island so it's really
08:00 - simple the username is admin and the
08:02 - password is go fish
08:03 - so geo pH I s H this press enter and
08:08 - here you are in the go fish
08:11 - admin dashboard so I will start covering
08:14 - up his go fish admin dashboard in the
08:17 - next lecture but before that let's go
08:20 - ahead
08:23 - where is it and change the password so
08:25 - you just need to click on the username
08:27 - and here you can change the admin
08:29 - username and all and the passwords and
08:32 - here is the API key you can just go
08:35 - ahead and reset it if you want so here
08:38 - we have the
08:41 - oh fish was the oil password and the new
08:43 - password right here so
08:49 - let's click on save
08:53 - and you can see it updated successfully
08:56 - and let's just go ahead and log out so
08:58 - that is how you log in and log out and
09:00 - text textures let's start exploring the
09:03 - Gaul fish film work dashboard now I'll
09:05 - just cancel and terminate this process
09:08 - by ctrl C here so that is how you just
09:11 - kill the server and that's all for this
09:14 - lecture I'll see in the next one think
09:16 - you're watching welcome back everyone in
09:18 - this lecture I will like you all to move
09:21 - your coffee framework on a VPS so that
09:25 - you can connect a domain name with it
09:27 - now you can do this thing on your Kali
09:30 - Linux machine or basically any operating
09:33 - system or anything whichever you are
09:35 - using you can do this on that thing but
09:37 - it will not be really convenient until
09:40 - you have a static IP address because
09:43 - your domain name the domain name which
09:45 - you will be using actually you will need
09:48 - to have a domain name as well but we can
09:50 - take that for free from a lot of
09:52 - services like freedom so that domain
09:55 - name will not point to your your machine
09:58 - and you will need a dynamic DNS and
10:02 - there are a lot of troubles with that so
10:04 - I would recommend to setup a VPS for
10:06 - this kind of work now I am here in my
10:09 - digital ocean dashboard and if you don't
10:13 - know about the solution you can just
10:14 - google it and get yourself a account
10:17 - this lotion provides you $10 for free by
10:21 - using the coupon code to10 currently it
10:25 - is the coupon code maybe they will
10:27 - change it so you might want to check
10:28 - that and you can even use if you have
10:32 - already an account you can use your
10:33 - account if you don't have you can even
10:35 - use my referral link that will
10:37 - additionally give you $10 so that you
10:39 - can process and you can proceed with
10:42 - this lecture now I will create a droplet
10:44 - here droplet is a VPS
10:48 - I don't know what happened wrong so I'll
10:50 - just go ahead and click create a droplet
10:51 - here and it is still loading dissolution
10:55 - is not working fine okay so here you
10:58 - need to choose a opening system now you
11:01 - can basically choose any operating
11:02 - system I'll go with the Ubuntu oh it
11:06 - doesn't really matters here you can
11:08 - choose your size now this is just a
11:09 - fishing server doesn't need a lot of RAM
11:12 - so maybe $5 will be perfect oh I'll take
11:16 - the Bangalore which is most near to me
11:18 - and yeah that's all you can add SSH key
11:22 - if you want but I won't add any here
11:25 - let's create
11:31 - and it'll just it created soon so till
11:34 - then let me open my email
11:38 - get the password because we are not
11:40 - using a ssh key here
11:49 - you
11:55 - I'm going to take more than dominant our
11:58 - whole setup to come
12:05 - again the password has come maybe this
12:07 - will also work in some seconds
12:13 - what the mail on my phone it's not
12:14 - working here as well
12:19 - my intern connection is working right
12:22 - is working and why not these both of
12:26 - these services are working a catalyst
12:27 - delusion
12:28 - yeah so did Lauren given me the IP and
12:31 - is now here but my mail service is
12:34 - working again and the password will be
12:36 - very long so I at
12:39 - and open
12:43 - a new tab
12:45 - maybe that will work
12:50 - so here is the password
12:56 - I want to copy this password basically
13:00 - and actually the IP Ezreal I'll just
13:03 - copy everything I really don't need this
13:06 - digitalocean panel anywhere we just
13:08 - created the door plate that's all and
13:10 - there is no role of this panel let me
13:12 - minimize everything
13:15 - it was this whole email
13:18 - it means our
13:21 - a text file here
13:29 - you
13:33 - we did I created that fire
13:37 - waited on desktop
13:40 - raided on desktop
13:45 - here we have got it ex well it's edited
13:48 - East the information
13:53 - IP address username and a password so
13:55 - let's go ahead and login in this server
13:58 - I'll be using the terminal for this let
14:01 - me open a new tab ok is this my go-fish
14:04 - server running here I don't hit it
14:10 - one thing if this is running or not
14:16 - yeah so the recording is being done okay
14:20 - so let's clear this screen now let's
14:22 - move today
14:26 - let's stop our root directory and let's
14:28 - go ahead and login so we will just use
14:30 - SSH and then we have root at the rate
14:34 - this IP address
14:38 - name is road
14:40 - did the IP address controls you have two
14:42 - V for paste who asked me for the
14:44 - password it'll possibly ask me do you
14:48 - want to connect with this
14:50 - so yes okay sorry y-yes yes here it is
14:55 - asking me for the password now I will
14:58 - grab the password
15:02 - ester that and press Enter
15:07 - yeah so it is asking me to change the
15:10 - password so first of all I am adding the
15:12 - current password
15:16 - okay I don't know what I type here let
15:19 - me go back
15:23 - so just in your password here
15:29 - okay password change play the screen now
15:32 - we need the coffee framework so I really
15:34 - don't need it and let's open the Firefox
15:37 - and get the go fish framework URL so we
15:40 - have the get go fish
15:49 - and
15:51 - Eve
15:53 - I am using a
15:59 - it is uninstall to summon for is not
16:02 - well I believe I'm using it for a bit
16:04 - this is go ahead with dad only
16:11 - it
16:15 - odd
16:18 - you
16:23 - here is the 64-bit the next distribution
16:27 - I'll copy this link and quickly the skin
16:31 - I'll use the W gate to get this URL so W
16:36 - get in the space this URL and press
16:37 - Enter
16:38 - and now it will download this go fish
16:43 - framework for you guys now it may take
16:45 - some time depending upon the server
16:47 - speed and because the server is in India
16:52 - this is going to take a lot of time
16:57 - it is taking a lot of time here
17:00 - I should have chosen anything else I
17:02 - don't know why I chose Bangalore
17:08 - so the speed is actually increasing and
17:11 - increasing so it'll get downloaded where
17:14 - its own basically yeah so it is keep on
17:16 - increasing now
17:19 - Hey all right is just one in yeah so we
17:24 - just caught that thing downloaded the
17:26 - screen and unzip the file so unzip and
17:29 - just
17:32 - press G and press tab to autocomplete
17:35 - let's unzip this file again zip is not
17:39 - currently stalled lesses install unzip
17:41 - first of all unzipped
17:45 - it would be installed in this
17:50 - yeah it is now installed let's try this
17:57 - so we just install unzip and now we are
18:00 - extracting everything out from that
18:02 - directory and here we just extracted
18:05 - everything so if I just list then we
18:08 - have a folder and we have the file so we
18:12 - are basically concerned with default or
18:13 - only now I will go ahead and leave the
18:16 - go fish framework server running so what
18:19 - I can do is I will first of all move to
18:22 - the go fish directory here
18:25 - okay
18:28 - and
18:30 - here as we that configuration file
18:34 - contains D listening port in the callee
18:37 - machine now we would like to edit it
18:38 - because in Kali machine we were on the
18:40 - machine and we were able to use the
18:42 - local port but in this case we are using
18:46 - it on EVPs and we will not be able to
18:48 - accesses before like if we don't edit it
18:52 - so you can use any text editor I will go
18:56 - with the Nano
18:58 - now here you will see that the port is
19:01 - 1/7 2.0 0.1 and we need to edit it to
19:05 - 0.0 0.0
19:09 - here we are 0.0.0.0 and that's all and I
19:13 - would actually change the port
19:17 - it'll be one seven to four
19:23 - sorry
19:25 - I just changed the port for
19:27 - convenience basically and that is
19:29 - everything done so I will just press
19:32 - control X
19:34 - and the why in press enter
19:38 - and clear the screen and that's all now
19:40 - you just need to start your go fish
19:42 - server sorry
19:48 - Go Fish server or basically I believe
19:51 - that on a VPS we need to add the
19:56 - executable permission so I will add th
19:59 - mod + X
20:01 - permission executable permission to go
20:03 - fish here
20:06 - said that and now I believe we can just
20:09 - start sorry we can just start this over
20:11 - so here we have dot slash Go Fish press
20:17 - enter and here it has started
20:20 - successfully so we really don't need it
20:23 - now
20:25 - and now you can access your server okay
20:27 - I forgot what was the IP address this is
20:30 - the IP address
20:32 - now this is not the IP address we need
20:35 - the IP address of the server basically
20:36 - and later on we will even not need the
20:39 - IP address because we will add a domain
20:40 - name to this server so at the moment we
20:45 - need the IP address but in next lecture
20:47 - we will add a domain name to this but
20:48 - that it'll be able to point to that so
20:51 - now we have this IP address again you
20:55 - can just see eh not found the okay sorry
20:57 - we are not using the port here
21:01 - now here you can see the same error
21:02 - which means that we are not using the
21:04 - HTTPS version
21:07 - okay it'll show me a security exception
21:11 - but I know this is my side so it is
21:12 - really secure an exception and I'll just
21:16 - go with the confirm security
21:20 - oh here is the Go Fish framework of a
21:22 - login and change the password as soon as
21:24 - possible so it is the goal which is the
21:29 - default
21:32 - Here I am in the dashboard and let's go
21:35 - ahead and change the password soon so
21:37 - here we have
21:41 - it is gobhi usage and the new password
21:52 - I just changed the password here
21:56 - yeah it got successfully changed
21:58 - basically
22:01 - and I even looked out let's go ahead and
22:03 - check that again we have Edmund
22:13 - you
22:16 - yeah so now we are able to login so
22:17 - password has changed successfully
22:19 - yeah that is how we set up go fish on a
22:21 - VPS and from now in next lecture we will
22:24 - basically set up a we'll set up yes a
22:28 - domain name to this server so that we
22:31 - can proceed with a domain name and then
22:33 - we have a lot of works to do after that
22:35 - so we will just need a domain name
22:37 - basically and then we can start fishing
22:39 - and making the profiles landing pages
22:41 - email templates user groups campaigns
22:43 - and we can start fishing with the go
22:45 - fish so that was all for this lecture I
22:47 - see you the next one thank you for
22:48 - watching
22:50 - welcome back everyone in the last
22:52 - lecture we set up the VPS with the Go
22:54 - Fish framework and in this lecture we
22:56 - want to have a domain name pointing to
22:58 - that VPS so that we can use it now I
23:01 - would take a domain name from free Nam
23:03 - Kham that gives the domain names were
23:06 - free for one year and if you want you
23:09 - can basically get registered with a
23:12 - domain name that is most near to your
23:15 - target real domain name that will be a
23:17 - good thing to do here but here let's go
23:21 - ahead and sign in first
23:24 - I really don't know how many domains I
23:26 - will have in that account
23:28 - I'm really not sure about it
23:34 - taking a little slow because of the VPN
23:37 - because maybe I am using
23:46 - you
23:49 - I don't know why it's not loading up
23:54 - that is working fine and you see that
24:03 - oh here again it just got loaded up as
24:08 - soon as I press ENTER yeah so I will
24:11 - sign up at Google here
24:16 - they test account
24:20 - this will not have any domain name
24:23 - now I'll go to services the main names
24:27 - which it is in names
24:33 - but just our domain here it is
24:40 - here we will get a domain name so let's
24:43 - get it I mean named linear to us which
24:47 - will be like let's say pH MC securities
24:55 - our website is PSM securities dot org
24:57 - but let's get the pH MC securities
24:59 - thought maybe CFG L whatever is
25:02 - available here you can see we have a lot
25:04 - and I believe that the ml one looks a
25:10 - little lizard so I'll click on get it
25:13 - now
25:15 - and I will just check out with this
25:17 - domain name
25:19 - we can check out
25:23 - and I'll need to fill some details here
25:25 - basically oh I'll get it
25:27 - for one year maybe
25:30 - okay
25:32 - now we have used the endless for this
25:35 - domain name so we will configure this
25:37 - thing later let's go ahead and continue
25:40 - and proceed with this
25:44 - right and here we want to fill in all
25:47 - the details
25:56 - you
26:00 - I'll add my details basically here so he
26:03 - would start
26:06 - was
26:13 - you
26:16 - obviously on that this one investment
26:18 - will work anywhere but still I'll just
26:21 - complete the order
26:23 - okay there is a problem
26:27 - I
26:29 - at this here
26:35 - hey let me finish it really fast now
26:44 - right what's left now this
26:48 - here I forgot to take this thing and
26:50 - that is why I didn't complete it now in
26:52 - this case it should get me a domain name
26:56 - now I have got the domain name let's go
26:58 - ahead to the client area we have the
27:00 - services my domains here in my domains
27:03 - we'll go ahead and click on manage
27:05 - domain
27:09 - and they will go ahead to the name
27:11 - service basically so it should be here
27:13 - management tools and name service now we
27:15 - will use the name servers of the digital
27:17 - ocean because we are using the digital
27:20 - ocean here because right
27:25 - these lotions nameserver RNs one dot
27:27 - just washing calm
27:31 - ns-two door - lotion calm and NST lure
27:35 - digitalocean calm
27:44 - and you can just leave the fourth one
27:48 - deleted and fine as well so let's go
27:51 - ahead and change the name servers it may
27:54 - take up to 24 hours to propagate this
27:56 - domain name basically so we are not sure
27:59 - if this domain name is gonna work at
28:01 - this time but still we will go ahead and
28:04 - configure our digitalocean account
28:08 - all right this is thing else
28:16 - it's Logan
28:21 - you
28:34 - but we should have the droplet here here
28:36 - it is and in right here we have a de
28:40 - domain in more so maybe this interface
28:43 - will change as the solution has sent me
28:45 - the email today that there will be
28:48 - changing the interface I'm actually not
28:50 - sure here in the domain name you can
28:52 - just add a domain name which ever you
28:53 - have caught for me I have got the PMC
28:57 - security stud ml
29:01 - here we are and the server and this
29:04 - click on a domain
29:10 - Oh
29:12 - yes yeah here we have got some default
29:16 - name DNS records maintained here but
29:20 - yeah we really don't need to care about
29:22 - them we yeah we really don't need to get
29:24 - about them is this go to droplet here
29:29 - and let's just if our domain name is
29:32 - working so our port is 1 7 2 4
29:38 - and I'm quite sure that this domain name
29:40 - will not work because of the
29:43 - okay so the main name is actually
29:45 - working I didn't expect it a little just
29:46 - get propagated this soon so we want to
29:49 - use HTTP sorry what I just typed here
29:52 - STD B is
29:56 - we'll add the security exception for
29:58 - this domain i domain because
30:03 - here is the domain name running the golf
30:06 - a server and here I can vary the easily
30:10 - man password is I actually changed that
30:12 - I believe
30:19 - so here is the domain name running
30:22 - coffee server this is a VPS and now we
30:25 - can do a lot of things now what I would
30:28 - recommend is to go head in digitalocean
30:30 - and all right here and open a support
30:33 - ticket basically so where is the support
30:36 - ticket I forgot yeah here is the support
30:38 - an open a support ticket and say that
30:40 - please unblock my SMTP server please
30:44 - allow me to send emails and write in
30:47 - that about this course that you are
30:50 - practicing this course and give them a
30:53 - link of this course and tell them that
30:55 - your practice in this course and you
30:58 - will not do anything illegally you are
31:00 - going to test it on your own email ids
31:03 - and this is a phishing server but you
31:05 - hereby guarantee that you will not do
31:08 - anything illegal here now you can tell
31:10 - them and they should basically unlock
31:13 - your SMTP server you should try to make
31:17 - convince them so if you are not able to
31:19 - convince them please let us know in the
31:21 - questions and we will try from our end
31:23 - now this was the thing which you need to
31:25 - do and if you are not able to get
31:27 - testing working with your domain name
31:28 - you should go ahead and check within to
31:32 - int or DNS comm slash your domain name
31:36 - so here is my domain name into DNS comm
31:41 - slash your domain name and just check
31:44 - which DNS servers and which IP is it
31:46 - using here you should find that DNS
31:48 - servers are changed and they are on
31:52 - these IPS basically and if these is if
31:55 - this is working right here it should
31:57 - mean that your domain has propagated
31:59 - successfully if it is not it should mean
32:02 - that like you should wait for at least
32:04 - 24 hours to 48 hours now this was all
32:07 - about setting up go fish now we are
32:09 - ready to start fishing and I'll see you

34:57 - okay and you do you want it actually be
35:01 - sorry the WWE Arjun - so just click on
35:03 - yes

35:07 - be right here you can then download that
35:08 - file for future reference maybe you will
35:11 - need that in future anyhow but yeah like
35:14 - let's say we will even download that
35:16 - thing and after it generates the CSR
35:19 - here you will again click on next it
35:21 - will generate what this it will generate
35:24 - a let's encrypt key for you guys and
35:27 - then you can also download that thing so
35:29 - we just want these files in this lecture
35:32 - in the next lecture we will go ahead and
35:34 - use those files we'll go ahead and get
35:37 - those files in the server so I'm just
35:40 - waiting for it now it may take up to
35:42 - five minutes also so just wait and give
35:45 - it some time
35:48 - it has generated me the seas as are so I
35:51 - will just download this thing
35:54 - have it
35:57 - now again click on next and this time it
35:59 - will create the account key
36:08 - you
36:37 - it's taking a little long but accept
36:40 - this get me the account key within one
36:42 - to two minutes I'm just reading for it
36:47 - and as soon as you download this will
36:49 - click on next and then it will ask us to
36:52 - verify the domain name so that like
36:54 - it'll ask us that is if this domain
36:56 - belongs to us only it will make sure
36:58 - that and I am still waiting I don't know
37:02 - why it's taking a lot of time ok it has
37:04 - downloaded it
37:05 - sorry degenerate did it and now
37:06 - downloading it up that is how I just
37:08 - downloaded that and let's just click on
37:10 - next and this time it'll ask me for the
37:12 - verification basically
37:16 - I have clicked on next here
37:18 - make sure you are on the DNS
37:19 - verification
37:23 - it is it is asking me for the domain
37:26 - verification and it'll ask me to create
37:29 - these records so for this I will go to
37:31 - my distortion panel here here I will go
37:34 - to networking and maybe this interface
37:37 - will change in some time they are saying
37:39 - this thing but here I will go to domains
37:44 - okay here is the domain name then I will
37:47 - just go to I believe I will go to more
37:50 - and manage domain
37:53 - and it should be similar in other
37:55 - previous providers as well almost
37:58 - similar and here I will just create the
38:00 - txt record so txt record okay now it is
38:04 - giving me the Dixie record should with
38:06 - this one
38:08 - with the value of this one so let's find
38:10 - here should be the value and this is the
38:13 - host name so host name will be the first
38:15 - thing which it is giving you and then we
38:17 - have the value here so just copy this up
38:21 - and paste it in the value value and just
38:26 - click on create record
38:32 - okay created successfully let's create
38:34 - second record as well so here we have
38:38 - that
38:40 - we have hostname and we have D value
38:46 - hey one second yeah pop it that and here
38:50 - paste it and create record now as soon
38:53 - as you create these two records so we
38:55 - want these two txt records here are they
38:57 - we have now been created we can proceed
39:00 - for the verification now the problem is
39:02 - that this might take some time you can
39:04 - just see here 15 to 20 minutes before
39:07 - clicking next so I will actually you
39:12 - know I'm not actually sure but
39:16 - we've gone next year
39:24 - you
39:36 - okay it says it has failed
39:46 - so it has not been graded still and I
39:50 - actually need to wait for that basically
39:55 - let us change the records so these
39:59 - records got change here
40:06 - so I need to modify the hem and I'll
40:09 - just go ahead and edit these
40:16 - this is the main issue so you know you
40:18 - need to wait for around like whatever
40:21 - they are saying the time so you need to
40:23 - wait for that okay i pasted the wrong
40:27 - value here and they rode a how am i
40:29 - doing this one is to be added at this
40:31 - www record
40:36 - yeah
40:42 - yeah and this is www well you
40:53 - you
41:08 - I obviously created these records but
41:10 - they are not visible so I actually need
41:13 - to wait for 15 to 20 minutes and I don't
41:16 - want to waste a lot of time for you guys
41:18 - so I'll see you guys in the next lecture
41:20 - where I'll be up with these records so
41:23 - these records will be up and running so
41:25 - you know we'll just try this thing and
41:27 - I'll see you guys in the next lecture so
41:30 - thank you so much for watching I'll see
41:32 - you then hey welcome back everyone in
41:34 - the last video we just created our txt
41:36 - records but actually I just noticed that
41:39 - we did a little mistake out there so you
41:41 - can just see here let's say we want to
41:44 - create this record let's say this one so
41:47 - first one you know if you just copy and
41:49 - paste this thing here I have actually
41:52 - solved this now you can see here this
41:56 - dot Pete and the cigar disorder ml is
41:59 - repeating two times which should not be
42:01 - the case
42:01 - so you basically need to remove this dot
42:04 - p h MC dot M L and you just need this
42:08 - part of the D record so a cm each
42:12 - underscore a CMA - challenge so this
42:15 - should be the record and then here
42:16 - should be the value now the thing is
42:18 - that with the www which is the second
42:21 - record you will not be able to create it
42:23 - because you have not created the www
42:26 - record so you basically need to create
42:29 - twww record first and that should be a
42:32 - Syrian record so go to cname just say
42:35 - add www here and just add at the red
42:40 - sign here just click on create record
42:42 - and that's all that is how you create
42:45 - the www record and as soon as you create
42:49 - that you can now go ahead and create D
42:53 - the taken record here so just add this
42:56 - thing underscore is eme - challenge or
42:59 - www and add the value here so the value
43:02 - given to us is this
43:08 - the value here is click on add record
43:10 - now there is a way to check your records
43:13 - through the you know like what it is to
43:16 - the terminal you can also go ahead ahead
43:20 - and do ms to MX toolbox txt record test
43:28 - the MX toolbox is the one which I would
43:31 - recommend so here DNS lookup text or a
43:34 - call here and you just want to copy and
43:37 - paste these records in the test it will
43:39 - just show you if they exist or not here
43:42 - you just want to paste this thing and
43:44 - test for the record and a case um okay
43:49 - this yeah here you can see DNS record
43:52 - has been published let's check the
43:53 - second one which we just published so it
43:57 - will like it should be there here we
44:00 - have text lookup
44:06 - okay so it again says that it has been
44:08 - published and that was just a quick fix
44:11 - of our last mistake so let's go ahead
44:14 - and yeah go to zero and so let's click
44:17 - on next
44:19 - okay I just clicked on that and it is
44:21 - not checking and it should basically get
44:23 - the records because they have already
44:25 - been created and we have verified that
44:26 - thing too
44:27 - okay there is some unexpected error here
44:34 - you know this error was something else I
44:36 - really don't know I will just go ahead
44:38 - and try once again with the records
44:48 - I'm okay I just clicked next and the
44:52 - certificate is basically yeah it is
44:55 - basically ready so what I have to renew
44:58 - and repeat the process using the same a
45:01 - leaky and CSR so if you have downloaded
45:04 - those two files you can just go ahead
45:07 - and open them and paste them and just
45:08 - click on next to renew your certificate
45:11 - and now we have this under difficut has
45:14 - been downloaded right in made so here we
45:18 - have that thing
45:19 - we will now download the certificate
45:24 - okay
45:27 - I will click on this
45:30 - I believe I have already downloaded this
45:32 - one
45:33 - okay don't mean yeah I have not
45:35 - downloaded that
45:38 - difficut has been done now we have the
45:40 - domain key
45:46 - okay we also got the domain key here on
45:50 - domain certificate here now we can go
45:52 - ahead and set up the certificate in that
45:54 - what it is in the server so let's go
45:59 - ahead and do that I really don't need it
46:01 - something else I was I mean there's
46:05 - something else I was working
46:08 - earlier let's go ahead to the terminal
46:11 - this is also something else yeah here is
46:15 - the terminal let's close this server and
46:19 - let's go to config dot yes and basically
46:25 - I'll go to nano
46:28 - config dot Jason
46:32 - now here you will see actually this is a
46:34 - true but I change it to false let me
46:38 - just again do it on true because I
46:42 - remember it was true I was just doing
46:43 - some testing basically now here we have
46:48 - this example of CRT and Kiro CRT so we
46:52 - will just go ahead and change it to we
46:55 - will just change this domain basically
46:57 - example to the domain name let's go
47:00 - ahead and change that
47:03 - okay now we will change it to be its MC
47:09 - mmm
47:11 - right we also have this key to change
47:21 - you
47:25 - right so this works you can basically
47:28 - give it any name but I just give it this
47:31 - name to remember this thing so I'll just
47:32 - press control X Y and I'll just press
47:36 - ENTER before that you can just see these
47:38 - headings it should be almost the same so
47:41 - now I just press control C now we need
47:45 - to create this certificate file and the
47:47 - key file so for that I will do is I will
47:52 - just copied this file this file I'll
47:55 - just copy this hit the name and I'll
47:57 - just edit this file and so I will just
48:00 - type in CP Corphish - Edmond not CRT so
48:08 - I will copy this thing to the same
48:10 - directory with the name of it was pH MCS
48:15 - Hiyori T's okay sorry
48:18 - ehm c and c CU rit IES dot ml dot c RT
48:25 - I just press that thing would check so
48:28 - here we have this under difficut and i
48:31 - will also do the same for the key here
48:35 - at this time I'll
48:37 - kids little lagging this connection is

51:51 - actually fine
51:54 - yep now basically we have got everything
51:57 - here let's just make sure the name is
52:00 - correct pH MCC care at least what I'm a
52:02 - latke so let's go ahead and edit the
52:06 - like check the configuration file once
52:11 - again
52:13 - if we have p.m. physically stored em a
52:15 - lot CRT and owe them a lot e SEC URI TI
52:20 - es su RIT is yes so this looks pretty
52:26 - fine here right
52:31 - I believe I have some problem here it
52:33 - should be port 80 here it is not already
52:38 - also it should actually when you are
52:40 - using the you know when you are using
52:42 - this thing EVPs it should be basically
52:46 - four four three here
52:50 - and I will even go ahead and add this
52:54 - thing to Crewe
52:58 - they'll see the configurations these are
52:59 - the exact contributions now I will close
53:02 - this thing give
53:04 - and
53:08 - and I will start this server here let me
53:12 - do it manually
53:16 - of door - Hegeman autocomplete
53:20 - I mean I will I have to do
53:27 - so I just started this server
53:31 - now it has actually started this server
53:33 - so what I can do is I you know I am
53:35 - using this screen which we discussed in
53:37 - a later video so I'll just press control
53:40 - a and D
53:42 - so now I had you'd ask that screen here
53:44 - now let's go ahead and try to visit the
53:46 - website each I'm city Gary's dot ml
53:52 - and it says unable to connect
53:56 - wait a minute because we are not using
53:59 - in as HTTP maybe
54:05 - what I edit here
54:13 - yeah so HTTP is working fine you can see
54:16 - there is a green lock and this is from
54:20 - let's encrypt so that is how we get the
54:23 - SSN certificate and let's go ahead 1 7 2
54:26 - 4 let's go ahead and basically get the
54:32 - he's ever working
54:34 - you know you can also add the SSL
54:37 - certificate of login page you know this
54:40 - is just an exception which we added here
54:42 - right we can even go ahead and add this
54:45 - to a certificate which we created so the
54:48 - same certificate can be shared by both
54:50 - of these port and I will basically
54:52 - change this thing
54:56 - so
55:00 - Green - are
55:02 - okay here is this control-c to break the
55:06 - server here and I will add it the Nano
55:11 - configuration though Jason and I will
55:13 - change this thing to the real
55:16 - certificate which we have just got so pH
55:18 - MCS ECU RIT ie s dot ml and this one as
55:23 - well
55:25 - eh MC secu rit IES dot ml e right so
55:32 - everything is fine here I'll just go
55:34 - ahead and press ctrl X and then Y and
55:37 - I'll just press ENTER and again start
55:40 - the server
55:43 - control a and D and I will now forget
55:46 - this thing I really never need to login
55:49 - in this again
55:50 - now make sure you don't forget to renew
55:52 - your essays a certificate after I
55:54 - believe it it should be after three
55:56 - months here you will find some
55:59 - some information on the renew so I would
56:03 - recommend you renew it on every yeah it
56:06 - is 90 days so you need to renew it after
56:08 - 90 days and it will be the same
56:09 - procedure so that's
56:14 - all done that's all for this lecture and
56:16 - let me assure you guys the log in page
56:18 - this time
56:22 - we'll take the certificate from let's
56:24 - encrypt so okay it's still showing me a
56:28 - security exception but let me
56:33 - had this remove the security exception
56:35 - yeah you can just see it is now actually
56:38 - let's encrypt certificate you can see
56:40 - that right so that was all in this
56:44 - lecture and from next lecture we will
56:46 - actually start working and start our
56:48 - fishing but thank you so much for
56:50 - watching
56:51 - hey welcome ak1 in this lecture we will
56:53 - actually go ahead and explore the
56:55 - coffee's dashboard so I have actually
56:57 - done some kind of you know I've done
57:00 - some kind of basic testing here so just
57:07 - don't remember the password now
57:09 - yeah this is the password so I am able
57:11 - to basically login so I really don't you
57:15 - know that let me to show you that here I
57:17 - have got some things here let me clear
57:22 - the dashboard that you can basically see
57:26 - how it's going to be done in the real
57:28 - life so I'm just going to clear
57:30 - everything you get a fresh installation
57:32 - almost fresh installation here I will
57:34 - delete everything
57:37 - just testing this stuff up so this is
57:40 - about that
57:46 - you always want to start from left to
57:49 - right which is from sending profile to
57:51 - the dashboard basically so
57:55 - you know and in Camping's I believe
57:57 - there should be nothing
57:59 - there is one
58:05 - okay the dashboard should be now clean
58:07 - basically yeah so let's go ahead and
58:10 - start with the sending profile now
58:12 - sending profile is really simple you
58:15 - will need to enter the SMTP web server
58:18 - here basically so what I'm going to do
58:21 - is
58:22 - [Music]
58:25 - Oh
58:27 - he'll add my gmail ending profile here
58:31 - so I'll add my gmail basically you want
58:34 - to get a SMTP which allow you to spoof
58:38 - your email like SMTP to go is a really
58:40 - good example and we will basically cover
58:43 - SMTP to go in the last lecture but for
58:47 - that like before that we will setup it
58:50 - with the Gmail okay so first of all you
58:53 - want to test for Gmail SMTP settings
58:59 - and you should obviously have a gmail
59:00 - account for this or you can basically
59:02 - choose any any email provider and search
59:05 - for their email settings
59:08 - now we have here is an SMTP dot okay
59:11 - where this yeah so SMTP server is this
59:14 - one
59:19 - then we have the world is five eight
59:22 - seven
59:23 - so in SMTP host we want to add the
59:28 - server then colon and port so it was it
59:33 - eight seven five it is five eight seven
59:36 - right
59:39 - I will just add that five eight seven
59:43 - now username will be your email ID
59:48 - well let's use another one
59:55 - our password will be your gmail account
59:57 - password
60:02 - then you have a profile name so it will
60:06 - be
60:11 - except as email and then you have like
60:13 - name can be anything then you have the
60:15 - from-- so I would like to send it from
60:18 - the name of text server and then
60:22 - brackets and then my email ID
60:28 - now basically this is the field where
60:30 - you have everything with spoofing if I
60:34 - wanted to send this email from Bill
60:36 - Gates I will add Bill Gates here and in
60:39 - the brackets I will have bill at delayed
60:41 - microsoft.com so this is where the
60:43 - sender the receiver will see who the
60:46 - message whom the person has sent this
60:48 - message this is the main thing but with
60:50 - Gmail I'm quite sure they will not allow
60:52 - you to send this from another email
60:56 - before that we will basically use some
60:59 - others SMTP relays in the last chapters
61:02 - but till then we will like we want to
61:05 - target everything else with the
61:08 - Camping's user groups email templates
61:10 - and landing page so till then just go
61:12 - ahead and get this thing and here you
61:15 - have the test email basically so you can
61:17 - send this test email to anyone
61:24 - okay
61:27 - the send a test email
61:36 - you
61:38 - okay now it says that please log in via
61:43 - a browser now gmail is not allowing me
61:47 - to send the email so this might be
61:50 - because less secure apps are not
61:52 - available on that
61:55 - email account
61:59 - now you can basically go ahead and
62:00 - change your settings okay that email
62:02 - account is even not listed here you know
62:05 - guys at this time I'm a little blank
62:07 - because that email account I'll have to
62:10 - add that him in here
62:15 - now you want to search for how to enable
62:17 - less secure apps for signing you can
62:21 - just see it basically blog designing so
62:24 - if you want to enable the less secure
62:27 - apps my account
62:29 - now this will be different for all
62:31 - providers
62:33 - and actually I'm not sure where this
62:35 - will be your sign-in and security maybe
62:40 - right let's go in that
62:44 - here we should have something light like
62:46 - let's secure a less secure apps
62:53 - I am not able to
62:57 - find that yeah here it is allow less
63:00 - secure apps I will just own it and now I
63:03 - will be able to send it SD me
63:09 - it is still blocking me here
63:13 - so I believe I will not be able to use
63:16 - Gmail guys so let's see if
63:22 - I can do something with this otherwise I
63:25 - will make another account and I'll just
63:27 - get back with that
63:35 - you
63:41 - if I just cancel this I'll try again
63:46 - if so I'm not able to do that
63:49 - I will not be able to do that because
63:51 - gmail is not allowing me to use your
63:54 - account now I will get a account fast
63:57 - outlook will allow me
64:02 - and I'm quite sure I already have made
64:04 - an outlook for this kind of testing here
64:07 - it should be an account I will just
64:09 - check that with logging in so outlook
64:12 - SMTP
64:14 - headings hurry the the settings is wrong
64:18 - there einen let's try
64:28 - you
64:31 - oh no my connection is gone here slow at
64:34 - this
64:37 - something's really wrong
64:42 - right let's check I believe I have an
64:45 - account
64:52 - it's insecurities
64:58 - you
65:00 - I did
65:02 - outlook.com
65:05 - yeah I I remember I have this account
65:09 - let me check the password if able to
65:12 - login okay this is wrong
65:17 - maybe this password
65:25 - yeah I got the password so I can
65:27 - basically use the SMTP here this is the
65:30 - SMTP
65:33 - we need the SMD B
65:39 - we'll get the SMTP settings he'll then
65:42 - let me add these your name and password
65:44 - here
65:46 - we have it as eh emcee securities
65:58 - I have the password as
66:05 - yes
66:09 - and ever
66:12 - at the empty air as well
66:15 - well pH MC
66:20 - Unity's here and E
66:24 - and
66:28 - SMTP server so the port is again five
66:31 - eight seven and the server is this one
66:41 - you have 587 this same 587 so I will
66:47 - just say in the SMTP here
66:51 - okay that's all with these settings
66:53 - let's do a test again oh it should work
66:55 - fine
66:58 - I just hope it will send the email
67:07 - you
67:09 - akiza's or for it yeah emails and so now
67:12 - the test was successful
67:13 - let's week now we can just go ahead and
67:15 - just save this profile I even got the
67:19 - email on my phone actually we just saved
67:22 - this profile and okay I will rename it
67:25 - to acknowledge email account so I will
67:27 - rename it here
67:30 - you just make sure I am
67:34 - incorrectly pH MC Outlook account right
67:37 - let's disable
67:39 - you know in later video we will try to
67:42 - get an SMTP server which will allow us
67:44 - to send spoofed email but now this will
67:46 - not allow us so in next lecture we will
67:49 - cover up the landing page and the email
67:51 - template till then take the leaves or
67:54 - thank you so much for watching

76:05 - next lecture thank you so much for
76:07 - watching
76:08 - hey welcome back guys in this lecture
76:10 - let's go ahead and open a private tab
76:13 - and let's visit the email so basically
76:16 - let's visit our gmail account and see
76:19 - what happens when we go ahead and surf
76:21 - the the things are right here
76:28 - every our sign
76:34 - you
76:37 - let's enter the email here
76:44 - I believe this is the password
76:50 - I am able to lock them and now you will
76:54 - just see
76:56 - yet here is the email which we sent
77:00 - let's open it
77:01 - this is email is coming from Outlook
77:05 - calm but you can even spoof it with a
77:08 - custom SMTP now here it seems like a
77:11 - really littered email but as soon as we
77:13 - click on a right answer here it will
77:16 - take us to our page you can just see
77:19 - that it is taking us to our fake page
77:21 - this is the fake Facebook page here you
77:24 - can just see that here I don't know why
77:27 - it's not loading these images perfectly
77:30 - but that can be like you know that can
77:34 - be some issue with the cloning this side
77:36 - so you can just go ahead and to
77:38 - facebook.com right click view page
77:41 - source and you can add the source
77:42 - manually but no problems let's add some
77:46 - test things here starter oneself
77:52 - Adelaide Thunderdome okay in password
77:58 - this is
78:01 - test
78:03 - let's press ENTER and you can see that
78:08 - it will redirect me to facebook.com the
78:10 - real Facebook
78:12 - right now there were some problems in
78:15 - the landing page here you can see there
78:17 - is some problem basically
78:20 - as try to visit the website also
78:25 - we need the HTTPS
78:34 - okay I directly I cannot directly visit
78:37 - this site I want to check this site
78:39 - again
78:44 - you can see even Gmail is not giving me
78:47 - any issues about the fake phishing
78:49 - website and all now guys there is some
78:51 - problem with the de cloning of site here
78:53 - you can just say this is not working at
78:55 - all this is some problem with cloning so
78:58 - you might just go ahead and enter the
79:00 - correct source of the page this is some
79:03 - problem in cloning when we create some
79:05 - landing page but let's go ahead and
79:07 - check the dashboard let's refresh the
79:09 - dashboard here you see emails and email
79:12 - open click link and submitted data now
79:15 - it is saying submitted data like it is
79:18 - not showing me any submitted data but
79:21 - you know we actually submitted that data
79:23 - so there is a little problem with the
79:26 - framework here
79:29 - let's go ahead and try something else
79:31 - let's go ahead and create another
79:34 - landing page
79:39 - and at this time maybe the you know like
79:42 - my website
79:44 - so
79:48 - let's go ahead and do that
79:56 - import now I'm not white yeah sorry
80:04 - I'm not quite sure we'll like it we'll
80:06 - be able to import my site correctly or
80:09 - not
80:16 - it was able to do at a great
80:21 - let's not redirect the user anywhere
80:30 - so we have got the bail let's
80:35 - you know let's go ahead and read one
80:37 - more camping here
80:39 - and let's do this thing on a test email

85:08 - you guys in the next lecture thank you
85:09 - so much for watching
85:12 - he will come again now you know like I
85:14 - was I was like finding this thing so I
85:17 - don't know I just missed this arrow here
85:19 - so here you can just see there is a
85:21 - small arrow he can click on this and it
85:23 - will show you the exact timeline for the
85:25 - person with the exact date and time as
85:28 - well and here you have the deeply
85:30 - credentials and the view details you can
85:33 - click here and it will even show you the
85:35 - credentials whose team in purpose and
85:38 - like I was just trying to get where this
85:41 - is not getting this thing now you can
85:44 - just see where do you want the
85:46 - credentials to be submitted to so you
85:48 - know the me like you can just click here
85:51 - replay credentials it will just try to
85:54 - log you with these credentials if it is
85:57 - able to its go ahead and try that
86:02 - it will just redirect to my site with
86:04 - the given credentials and it will not be
86:07 - able to allowed me in because the
86:09 - credentials are you know they are fake
86:11 - here you can see cookies are blocked and
86:14 - not supported by the web browser you
86:16 - must enable cookies who use WordPress
86:18 - not actually the cookies are blocked so
86:21 - I'm not able to do that and I believe my
86:24 - site will not allow me to do this kind
86:25 - of work but you can just click on replay
86:28 - credentials and it will try to log you
86:30 - in the real account with D credentials
86:32 - permitted by the user so that's one way
86:35 - you can actually go ahead and land in
86:39 - the users account so this was all about
86:41 - corphish only thing left is the SMTP
86:45 - profile which enables you to send
86:47 - message through any email you can see
86:50 - the email came from PMC securely stored
86:53 - at the it outlook.com let's go ahead and
86:56 - change it to pH NCE securities no let's
86:59 - go ahead and change it to dance email
87:01 - which is you know the PM's email which
87:03 - is the Dan at the rate pH MCE securities
87:06 - dot org so let's change it to that and
87:10 - basically in next lecture we will try to
87:12 - do this kind of stuff and I'm really
87:14 - curious about that to move the email
87:16 - address
87:17 - see you guys till then thank you so much
87:19 - for watching so welcome back guys this
87:22 - is the final lecture about the you know
87:25 - about the fishing with go fish so in
87:28 - this lecture I will talk about the email
87:29 - spoofing now for email spoofing it's
87:32 - really simple you need any SMTP server
87:34 - that allow you to send email without the
87:38 - verification of the domain name SMTP to
87:41 - go is one of them there are a lot there
87:44 - are plenty of them now I don't say that
87:49 - you guys should do this and I am NOT
87:51 - pointing anything to SMTP to go here you
87:55 - know like this if you use this kind of
87:59 - work on daily basis if you really want
88:02 - to do this you can set up your own SMTP
88:04 - server but I'm just going to use it in a
88:07 - really controlled manner okay I will
88:09 - just do it in a really controlled manner
88:11 - to me only if you want to do it or with
88:13 - others you might want to get
88:16 - a paid smtp server or might want to set
88:19 - your own smtp server on a VPS but I'll
88:22 - do it on a controlled manner because you
88:24 - know this also harmed the reputation of
88:27 - the company so SMTP to go IP address
88:30 - might get harm from this so I'll do it
88:33 - in a really controlled manner okay
88:34 - so let's go to sending profile now for
88:37 - this you can just go to SMTP to go and
88:40 - get yourself a account this will be this
88:43 - is a free account which I am using here
88:45 - so I'll just add a profile here so we
88:49 - have SMTP
88:52 - to go
88:54 - five
88:56 - from I will send this email from you
88:59 - know from
89:02 - core our team
89:04 - the sender will be will be the
89:10 - no reply
89:12 - I did
89:16 - Tom
89:18 - a host is this one port it's two five
89:21 - two five
89:24 - user name is my
89:30 - SMTP Togo username which is exactly the
89:33 - same
89:40 - you
89:50 - as what is your SMTP to go password
89:56 - and that's all now you don't want to
89:59 - click on send test email because this
90:01 - will left SMTP to go know that you are
90:04 - sending a spoof email and they will ban
90:06 - your account okay you just want to
90:08 - directly send it now I believe I said
90:11 - that we will be using dance email which
90:13 - is done I did it pH I'm physically org
90:15 - with DP HMC email but let's use the kora
90:19 - email this seems you know this seems
90:21 - more genuine and how to do I just save
90:25 - that setting
90:28 - I'm not her
90:30 - if they will allow me to do this kind of
90:32 - work okay if I just get banned you want
90:35 - to try another less empty okay it's go
90:39 - to a dashboard or let's just go to
90:41 - camping here
90:45 - you camping
90:47 - everything will be basically the same
90:51 - okay so add anything
90:56 - mattress
91:03 - you
91:09 - right wing profile as in Thibodaux the
91:14 - name is Stu testy let's launch this
91:17 - camping and maybe they will just ban me
91:20 - or doing this kind of work
91:22 - but this you can basically you know you
91:24 - can just go ahead and get yourself some
91:27 - kind of SMTP that allow you to do its
91:29 - kind of work or you can actually go
91:32 - ahead and it's a sending but I believe
91:35 - it will just fail
91:43 - you
91:47 - you know I really
91:51 - as email sent one eye all this is the
91:54 - old email I want
91:56 - in progress okay great
92:03 - okay it is giving me the error as
92:05 - expected so the error should be that
92:08 - they banned me right now see
92:12 - okay incorrect authentication data
92:14 - really I believe I have the correct
92:18 - authentication sending profiles
92:23 - you know if I just
92:27 - to do five to five right
92:33 - yeah we'll fight to five
92:36 - if I just go to my dashboard I don't
92:39 - want to see a band a message here
92:49 - this is an old email basically which
92:51 - says 300% bounce rate believe I believe
92:56 - I added something wrong in the
92:59 - in the port here NTP to go calm it's a
93:03 - sick killer
93:04 - okay this was the thing our ID IES
93:11 - let's save it
93:15 - let's we should do that camping
93:21 - if we have that II have a lists papi
93:25 - this campaign
93:27 - everything will be already done the
93:29 - selected group analysis look
93:38 - you
93:41 - okay camping the old I want to I
93:44 - really want this
93:47 - there's email sent really consent was it
93:51 - this fast Wow let's go ahead and check
93:54 - that email refreshing is temporary email
94:02 - okay we got that right here Cora team no
94:06 - reply at the red quorum you can se that
94:08 - it delivered my email right maybe this
94:14 - email can basically land in a hand
94:18 - folder of a lot of providers you can the
94:21 - see email has been spoofed successfully
94:22 - and I fear they would have just pan me
94:25 - for this thing
94:29 - that
94:32 - okay actually doesn't land in spam so
94:34 - that is why they didn't ban me and if I
94:37 - send this thing to Gmail maybe it'll
94:39 - land in spam and they will ban me up oh
94:41 - I can just see it is taking me to the
94:44 - phishing page it is even HTTPS no
94:48 - chances for anyone to survive this kind
94:51 - of attack in the sea no chances for
94:53 - anyone to survive this kind of like only
94:57 - thing is if it land in spam it's all up
94:59 - to you maybe you might want to do a fake
95:03 - call with a spoof caller a message which
95:06 - convinced the user to open that spam
95:09 - email and like it opens which convinced
95:13 - them to submit the data it's all up to
95:15 - you how you make them realize that was
95:18 - all about phishing and I'll see you guys
95:21 - in the next lectures thank you so much
95:24 - for watching
