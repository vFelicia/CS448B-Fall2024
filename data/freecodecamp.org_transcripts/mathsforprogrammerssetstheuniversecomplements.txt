00:00 - in this video i'll be introducing the
00:02 - concept of the universal set and
00:04 - complements
00:05 - so i want to begin by talking about the
00:07 - universal set which is commonly referred
00:09 - to as the universe now the reason i use
00:13 - this fancy looking u here is that
00:16 - i was
00:17 - defining the universe which is to say
00:20 - the maximum boundaries of my set my
00:24 - biggest set
00:25 - everything outside of this
00:27 - blue circle here
00:29 - doesn't exist i mean
00:31 - it in terms of the sets nothing exists i
00:34 - don't even exist computer doesn't exist
00:37 - you don't exist
00:38 - but everything within it
00:40 - does
00:41 - so that's a very important key now if i
00:44 - don't define this if i don't define my
00:48 - universal set
00:49 - then we just assume it to be the real
00:52 - numbers so if i just erase this
00:55 - then um
00:58 - you know this will just be the real
01:00 - numbers which is we've talked about in
01:03 - previous videos
01:04 - so
01:05 - the other thing i want to talk about is
01:07 - complements so if i say
01:09 - if i'm looking for the complement of b
01:12 - and i'll i'll put a more formal
01:14 - definition of if i'm looking for the
01:15 - complement of b
01:17 - then
01:19 - it is everything that is not within b so
01:22 - all the elements not within b
01:24 - are going to be part of the con
01:25 - complement so in this case
01:28 - it would look
01:29 - like this if i just highlighted
01:31 - everything
01:32 - it would be
01:34 - everything within the universe still
01:38 - and then
01:42 - so that is the complement of b it's all
01:44 - the elements that are not in b
01:50 - so that's that's quite a bit of
01:52 - quite a bit i mean you've got one two
01:54 - three four five six seven so since this
01:56 - is the real numbers these little dots
01:58 - here would represent
02:00 - all the numbers all every single value
02:04 - rational irrational that are not within
02:06 - b
02:07 - so if this is
02:09 - one and two or better how about this
02:12 - this is the uh rational numbers and
02:14 - these are the integers
02:16 - so
02:17 - these would be everything outside of
02:19 - this would be the irrational numbers
02:22 - and
02:24 - the
02:25 - non-integer values
