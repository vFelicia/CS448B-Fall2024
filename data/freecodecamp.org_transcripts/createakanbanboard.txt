00:00 - what does a developer do day-to-day well
00:02 - one thing i think you need to learn
00:03 - about is a compound board i discussed
00:05 - them in my previous two videos but we're
00:07 - finally gonna get into the details stay
00:09 - tuned for more
00:11 - [Music]
00:21 - up
00:22 - [Music]
00:30 - okay so i do start my day by checking my
00:32 - emails in slack but if those two things
00:35 - do not reveal any pertinent pressing
00:37 - issues then i go straight to the kanban
00:39 - board a kanban board is a workflow
00:42 - visualization tool
00:44 - it helps you see the flow
00:46 - of where the application is at the
00:48 - current moment so i did not get
00:50 - permission to show you my works con my
00:53 - board but i do have two tools that i
00:55 - want to share with you to help you
00:56 - create your own kanban board with user
00:58 - stories for your personal projects or to
01:01 - help you get started and learn about
01:03 - kanban boards before your first job
01:05 - so we're going to create a kanban board
01:08 - for sniffs and wolves an application for
01:10 - dogs to meet other dogs in their city
01:12 - now for the first tool i want to show
01:14 - you is trello trello can be used for
01:17 - your everyday life to help you organize
01:19 - different to-do lists and tasks that you
01:20 - have or it can be used for a kanban
01:23 - board to help you organize your own
01:25 - application
01:26 - now the syntax for combat board is
01:29 - simple and at its basics is just a to-do
01:32 - list you do to do
01:35 - doing
01:36 - and done and those are your columns that
01:38 - are going to house your user stories
01:40 - okay so a common board is like a big
01:42 - to-do list it helps you visualize that
01:45 - workflow and takes a user story from
01:47 - beginning to completed so we're going to
01:50 - create a kanban board of our own we're
01:52 - going to create it for sniffs and wolves
01:54 - oops
01:59 - i want it to be public so that somebody
02:01 - else can join and we're just going to do
02:04 - the basis of bases that you need for any
02:06 - kanban board and that is to do
02:10 - doing
02:11 - and done
02:13 - that's it simple right
02:15 - so
02:16 - then we're going to add user stories but
02:18 - for the sake of this example i'm just
02:20 - going to do something like epics so
02:23 - maybe you want to
02:25 - have somebody design
02:27 - the homepage
02:29 - you want to create that homepage
02:35 - maybe you want to have
02:38 - sign up or sign
02:41 - in page
02:43 - and then from our last video we talked
02:45 - about having a profile page
02:53 - all right so those are your user stories
02:56 - now in trello i know that you can share
02:58 - with other users the share tab is here
03:00 - and that helps you collaborate with
03:01 - other people so say i had other users
03:04 - and maybe
03:05 - amanda was my designer and she decided
03:09 - to design the homepage she would move
03:10 - that car to the doing lane because she
03:13 - is officially working on that user story
03:15 - and maybe i'm the developer and i'm
03:17 - going to go ahead and create that home
03:19 - page you do not need to have the designs
03:21 - to create the initial homepage you just
03:23 - want to have like the initial text and
03:26 - maybe the links that actually go to
03:27 - different places so we're working on
03:29 - those
03:30 - say two weeks or so goes by and um i've
03:35 - finished creating the home page and
03:37 - she's still working on the design so
03:39 - maybe i'm done with that part
03:41 - but i may need to create another user
03:43 - story to apply those designs to the home
03:45 - page
03:47 - so that's part of agile you want these
03:49 - user doors to be flexible so that you
03:51 - can
03:52 - go back and make sense of what you have
03:54 - and make sure that you have everything
03:56 - in order
03:57 - okay so that is the basics of the basics
03:59 - of a combine board you can create it
04:01 - easily and trello for any of your
04:03 - projects and will help you visualize
04:05 - that workflow for you and any teammates
04:07 - that you might have on your project now
04:09 - i do want to point out that trailer does
04:11 - have some cool features you can do
04:13 - what's called power ups aka add-ons so
04:16 - say you wanted to add on slack
04:19 - also there are developer tools so you
04:21 - can add github features and i see that
04:23 - you can also add some readme or markdown
04:26 - features which is a part of a
04:28 - developer's world so it you can add a
04:30 - lot of different things to help you
04:32 - through organizing your own projects and
04:34 - this is a great way to get started
04:36 - before you get your first job or just
04:38 - for any project that you may have
04:40 - so this is making sense for you so far
04:42 - go ahead and put coding like a boss in
04:44 - the comments below if not hopefully i
04:46 - will help you hash out those issues with
04:48 - the next tool that i want to talk about
04:50 - and that tool is github
04:52 - okay so trello had a lot of great
04:54 - features it was simple easy and it can
04:56 - be used for any project that you might
04:58 - have as well as any life goals that you
05:01 - need to organize but specifically for
05:04 - developers i think github is a great
05:06 - place to
05:07 - house everything from your code to also
05:10 - using their kanban board feature so
05:12 - we're going to go through that now
05:14 - so i'm going to go ahead and create
05:16 - a project called
05:18 - sniffs
05:22 - and
05:23 - hmm
05:25 - and wolves
05:29 - so
05:31 - it's an app
05:33 - that lets
05:34 - your pets
05:36 - meet other pets
05:40 - in the neighborhood
05:45 - i can't smell guys neighborhood
05:48 - it is public i want to initialize it
05:50 - with remy and we are going to create
05:52 - that repository
05:54 - so if you're not familiar with github
05:56 - github allows you to
05:58 - save
05:59 - snapshots of all your code and allows
06:01 - you to go back in time if you make any
06:03 - errors you can go back to a previous
06:05 - version and use that version instead of
06:07 - the one that's messed up
06:09 - that's the simple explanation of github
06:11 - so github also has a way for you to make
06:13 - a kanban board you'll go up here to
06:15 - projects
06:17 - and then you will plan your project
06:20 - no we're going to short task
06:25 - and we're going to create a project
06:26 - sniffs
06:28 - and wolves
06:30 - i'm not going to have a description
06:31 - because i feel like i've already
06:32 - described it
06:33 - we're going to add a column so this
06:35 - column is going to be to do just like
06:38 - before
06:39 - and then we're going to have doing
06:43 - and finally done
06:47 - so this is just like trello simple and
06:50 - easy
06:51 - and then you're going to go ahead and
06:52 - create the same user stories so we're
06:55 - going to create a
06:58 - design
07:04 - we're going to create
07:07 - the
07:08 - home page
07:14 - um we're also going to create
07:17 - sign in page
07:21 - and finally we're going to create the
07:23 - profile page
07:26 - i want to point out that
07:28 - your kanban board can get very big for
07:32 - example at my job every application has
07:34 - to be 508 compliant that means that
07:37 - every application has to be accessible
07:38 - to people with disabilities and it needs
07:41 - to be able to be read by screen readers
07:43 - or any other tools that somebody with a
07:45 - disability might be using in order to
07:48 - view that application
07:49 - so i'm going to add that here it's going
07:52 - to go between
07:54 - doing and done so
07:56 - we're going to say
07:57 - ready for
07:59 - 508
08:02 - you can easily move
08:04 - any columns
08:06 - wherever you need them to be and then
08:07 - we're going to add a
08:09 - doing
08:11 - 508
08:13 - we're going to add
08:15 - a pass
08:18 - and
08:19 - one last one oops
08:21 - sorry i'm going to add fail
08:26 - now
08:26 - this is what i would see on my board
08:30 - uh
08:31 - we have different kinds of views because
08:32 - we have columns that can be within
08:34 - columns so the main header would be 508
08:36 - and then within that big column you
08:38 - would see ready doing pass or fail
08:42 - so
08:43 - this is part of the workflow because i
08:45 - will work on the user story and then i
08:48 - will pass it on to the 508 team and
08:50 - those 508 team will have to go through
08:52 - the same process of doing to do doing
08:56 - pass or fail and then once it goes from
08:58 - there it will go to a whole nother team
08:59 - it will go to the user acceptance
09:01 - testing and those people will make sure
09:04 - that
09:04 - that user test passes the criteria that
09:07 - you gave it so remember when i said
09:09 - that that last part of the user story is
09:13 - to help you test that um
09:15 - that task
09:17 - that is for
09:19 - not only the developer not only the 508
09:21 - people but for the users to test that
09:24 - user store to make sure that it follows
09:26 - the requirements that they need
09:28 - okay so i just wanted to point out a few
09:30 - other features that might help you out
09:31 - on your journey so we're just gonna go
09:34 - through it in just a little bit say that
09:37 - someone came in and they're still
09:38 - working on creating designs
09:40 - say i came in and mine went through 508
09:42 - or it's ready for 508 and let's just say
09:45 - another user passed 508 and they decided
09:49 - to move their card over to the dumb lane
09:52 - also this done lane can be interpreted
09:54 - to
09:55 - ready for production so you're ready to
09:57 - push up that code to your production
09:58 - environment also i just want to point
10:01 - out that you can have
10:03 - some interesting features so like
10:05 - creating a
10:06 - checklist
10:08 - so maybe this is redundant because it's
10:09 - already a big old to-do list but maybe
10:11 - you want to make sure that
10:14 - you talk to the product owner
10:28 - and that's going to create a check box
10:30 - so that you can check it just as if it
10:32 - were a to-do list in a to-do list
10:34 - also i created an issue just for this
10:37 - and you can add those issues directly to
10:40 - your board so you would go to add a card
10:43 - and you'll see this issue right here and
10:45 - you can
10:48 - sorry about that add a card and add this
10:52 - to your board there we go
10:54 - so
10:55 - now you know how to use the basics of
10:58 - github for kanban board purposes and you
11:00 - can house all that workflow into one
11:03 - place
11:04 - okay so i really encourage you to get to
11:06 - know trello or github combine boards in
11:08 - more detail and start using it for your
11:11 - projects this will help you prepare for
11:13 - your first job or just have a better
11:15 - workflow for the project that you're
11:17 - working on be it real life any goals
11:20 - that you may have or specifically a
11:23 - project or an application that you're
11:24 - building on your own time
