00:00 - hey what's up my name is matt woods and
00:02 - i'm going to talk a little bit today
00:04 - about how i landed my dream software job
00:06 - in about 12 months you see
00:10 - i'm relatively new to development and
00:12 - all this kind of stuff and but i've
00:14 - always loved computers i've always kind
00:16 - of nerded out over technology and was
00:18 - big into video games and always was kind
00:20 - of the go-to tech person with computers
00:23 - and everything but it wasn't until
00:25 - uh like a couple years ago that i really
00:27 - bear down and got serious about software
00:29 - got involved in like a coding boot camp
00:31 - and like really started to run with it
00:33 - and learn javascript and learn some php
00:34 - and different things um and it
00:36 - eventually uh getting involved in the
00:38 - community all these crazy things and so
00:39 - i'm gonna i'm gonna talk a little bit
00:40 - about um basically my journey um from
00:44 - about a year ago when i went to my first
00:46 - software development conference with
00:48 - thunderplanes and how the people i met
00:50 - there and the habits i built along the
00:52 - way helped me actually get a full-time
00:54 - job there we're actually the ship code
00:56 - to production where i work on an awesome
00:58 - marketing team and get to use the best
01:00 - parts of marketing that i love and in
01:02 - development and get to bring those two
01:04 - skills together and uh some skills that
01:07 - like whether you're you're more on the
01:08 - technical side or whether you want to
01:10 - work in a software business just some
01:11 - stuff that anyone can pick up and use
01:13 - but it's mainly going to focus on kind
01:14 - of the development side of that
01:16 - um
01:17 - and so
01:18 - i remember uh
01:20 - man when i started this journey
01:23 - you know
01:24 - like 12 18 months ago
01:26 - i had never really touched javascript
01:28 - before i was always someone who had like
01:30 - poked around with html and css it kind
01:32 - of stayed in my lane uh and kind of done
01:34 - some fun and stuff i'd like messed
01:35 - around with like bootstraps and some
01:37 - styling things uh like made some quick
01:39 - tweaks on websites maybe messed around
01:41 - with some wordpress themes but i never
01:43 - really like dug and built something from
01:45 - the ground up or built something that i
01:46 - can say like uh that was original that
01:48 - i'd made it i had an idea in my head and
01:51 - i wrote some code and i made it work um
01:53 - and then i i think back and compare that
01:55 - to the past
01:56 - a few weeks and things i've been working
01:58 - on where i've actually gotten to to pair
02:00 - on real like code that's going to go
02:02 - production with like uh the co-founder
02:04 - of the startup that i'm working at that
02:05 - has you know 28 people in oklahoma city
02:08 - and new york and we have you know
02:11 - thousands and thousands of people that
02:13 - use our app
02:14 - we're tackling real code and i'm getting
02:16 - to actually see work that i do go out
02:18 - into the real world and be seen by more
02:20 - people than i ever thought possible
02:21 - which totally just blows my mind and i
02:23 - couldn't know that the things that i was
02:25 - i'd hope that the things i was learning
02:26 - would be that applicable but it's a
02:28 - whole different thing to actually see it
02:30 - in action
02:31 - um
02:31 - some other crazy things that have
02:33 - happened recently is just being able to
02:34 - build my network and meet other people
02:36 - in software and be able to like really
02:38 - advance my career by leaps and bounds to
02:40 - the point where like uh i wanted to
02:43 - get to know other people in this area
02:45 - that i'm looking to grow in this growth
02:46 - professional area where you're kind of
02:48 - combining engineering and marketing and
02:50 - the best parts of both and so i decided
02:52 - to go on kind of this connection spree
02:54 - and reach out to a bunch of people who
02:55 - knew this better than i did so i reached
02:57 - out to people from facebook and spotify
02:59 - and airbnb and pinterest and google and
03:02 - all like the companies that i could the
03:03 - best companies i could think of that
03:04 - actually have these growth teams that
03:06 - combined engineering and marketing and i
03:08 - was able to connect with 25 really
03:10 - qualified people in less than 24 hours
03:13 - because of the connections i've been
03:14 - able to make um
03:16 - habitually with some of the stuff i'm
03:17 - going to talk about in a little bit uh
03:20 - and that's been a huge game changer for
03:21 - my career and just
03:23 - even going beyond oklahoma city with
03:24 - some of the connections i've been able
03:26 - to make
03:26 - as well as just like getting involved
03:28 - with events and different uh being able
03:30 - to share my work out in public and it's
03:32 - open doors to meet founders ceos and
03:34 - excellent engineers and marketers from
03:37 - all kinds of awesome companies uh in
03:39 - oklahoma city but also uh in boston and
03:42 - san francisco and other places and i've
03:43 - actually gotten to meet some of them
03:45 - face to face and that's been a total uh
03:46 - game-changing experience um
03:49 - and i've made lots of valuable
03:51 - connections that i treasure this day and
03:53 - i'm hoping it's just the beginning um so
03:56 - i'm going to talk about how that
03:57 - happened too
03:58 - but really if i had to like narrow down
04:01 - uh the three things that i want to talk
04:03 - about these three key habits that kind
04:04 - of opened the door to me being able to
04:06 - step into my dream job and software uh
04:09 - i'd say that there were these three
04:11 - things i'm going to go more in depth on
04:12 - each of these the first habit
04:14 - is becoming an automatic learning
04:16 - machine and i'm going to talk about what
04:18 - that means and kind of how you can build
04:20 - that up yourself
04:22 - the second thing is building a three
04:24 - circle network and i'll explain what
04:26 - those three circles are and why each of
04:28 - them matter and you have to do them in
04:29 - sequence and then the last step is
04:32 - sharing your byproducts
04:34 - basically as you're learning the stuff
04:35 - how you can put it on the world to not
04:37 - only help other people but to help
04:39 - yourself
04:40 - get the job and the and the do the work
04:43 - that you want to do and live the life
04:44 - you want to live uh because that's why
04:46 - we're doing this stuff
04:48 - so uh anyways i'll have to say hi my
04:50 - name is matt uh i'm a marketer and
04:52 - developer at tailwind right now
04:55 - you can check me out on twitter at
04:57 - matafur tweet me with any questions or
04:58 - follow-up stuff you have after this
05:00 - uh or you can check out my website at
05:02 - mattwoods.io
05:04 - and we are always hiring at tailwind so
05:05 - if you're interested
05:07 - in kickstarting your development
05:09 - career or making a change always let me
05:12 - know
05:13 - happy to chat about that too but i want
05:15 - to dive into this first
05:16 - habit this becoming an automatic
05:19 - learning machine i think more than
05:21 - anything this is the thing that enabled
05:23 - me to make the jump from what i was
05:25 - doing before which is like working at a
05:27 - marketing agency and hop into
05:29 - a a software startup at tailwind where
05:33 - i'm actually shipping code and doing
05:34 - these things and so i was at the
05:36 - marketing agency when i was like
05:39 - starting to kind of
05:40 - jump into this coding journey but i
05:42 - wasn't really sure where to start and i
05:43 - think like a lot of people i i kind of
05:45 - had this feeling i was talking to
05:47 - a buddy
05:48 - uh earlier this week who's just getting
05:51 - started in coding and one of his number
05:53 - one questions was basically why am i
05:55 - feeling so apprehensive towards getting
05:57 - involved in new projects and getting
06:00 - started in coding um and it's a really
06:03 - good question and i think it's one that
06:05 - pretty much everyone feels when they're
06:06 - getting started uh and my answer is like
06:09 - you know to fight that apprehension that
06:11 - everyone feels that you need to give
06:12 - yourself
06:13 - more
06:14 - wins you need things that you're going
06:15 - to feel good about that you can like
06:17 - plant a flag in the ground and say hey i
06:19 - built this i did this i feel good about
06:21 - this coding is exciting it's not easy
06:24 - but i did it and i want to do more of it
06:26 - so how do you get those wins well it
06:28 - doesn't just happen it doesn't just fall
06:30 - on your lap this stuff is hard but the
06:32 - way that you get better to get those
06:34 - wins is you have to ship
06:37 - more and when i say ship you know it's
06:39 - not like you know carnival cruise lines
06:41 - type of thing we're talking about um
06:43 - taking a piece of code a project
06:46 - something and putting it out in the
06:48 - world to where it's you know it may not
06:50 - be quote unquote finished and perfect
06:52 - but it is done and you are getting it
06:53 - out in front of real people real users
06:56 - real uh getting real feedback in the
06:58 - real world
06:59 - um
07:00 - i saw this tweet the other day by one of
07:02 - my buddies ezra
07:03 - who also started kind of learning to
07:05 - code around the same time that i did and
07:07 - i thought it was really insightful what
07:09 - he said was the biggest challenge i feel
07:12 - as a new or fresh developer is always
07:14 - comparing myself to other developers and
07:16 - i always get stuck wondering how they
07:17 - got there versus just learning how to
07:19 - work on stuff myself and just talk about
07:20 - this discipline of like putting your
07:22 - head down and building
07:24 - code is just something we all have to
07:26 - learn we all have to get better at
07:28 - because it's the only way that you get
07:31 - better
07:32 - i think one of the mistakes when when
07:34 - you get started with this habit of
07:35 - learning to code too is that you wanna
07:38 - you wanna start really big you wanna
07:39 - make the full app with like the the
07:41 - billing and the cool feature and this
07:42 - crazy marketing side it looks slick and
07:44 - it like gives slack a run for their
07:46 - money but i think actually the best way
07:49 - to go around this is
07:51 - to start small and consistent i read
07:54 - this book about how
07:56 - to basically create a habit of learning
07:58 - that really transformed the way i think
08:01 - about this and i i still reference it to
08:03 - this day it's called the one thing by
08:04 - gary keller and he the way he talks
08:06 - about it is like if you want the best
08:08 - chance to succeed at anything you want
08:10 - your approach should always be the same
08:12 - you have to go small because if you go
08:13 - too big uh you're not going to build up
08:16 - this feedback loop of getting a you know
08:18 - doing something hard but rewarding
08:20 - getting the win
08:22 - learning from it doing something a
08:23 - little bigger getting the win right if
08:25 - you if you start too big you're never
08:26 - going to get that feedback you're never
08:28 - going to get that win and you're not
08:29 - going to stay with it and so many people
08:31 - drop off and i came close at times like
08:33 - it can be really discouraging when
08:34 - you're getting started but sticking it
08:36 - out can make such a big difference
08:38 - um i think really
08:41 - building this coding habit
08:42 - to comes down to
08:44 - these two things healthy inputs
08:46 - and healthy output just like you know
08:49 - any any good system is going to
08:50 - understand its inputs and outputs you
08:52 - are a system when you're learning to
08:53 - code and you have to understand what
08:55 - you're putting into your learning
08:56 - environment to succeed and what's what
08:59 - what you're out putting into the world
09:01 - to make it an ultimate success and so in
09:04 - terms of input what are you putting in
09:06 - uh so this can look different for
09:08 - different people uh but some examples
09:10 - are like tutorials of like following
09:12 - different classes these are more
09:13 - accessible than they've ever been online
09:15 - uh you can join classes which is one of
09:17 - the things i did
09:19 - you can listen to podcast things like
09:21 - syntax and full stack radio and
09:22 - different uh great podcast by developers
09:25 - that can supplement things in uh in your
09:27 - learning journey you can go to events
09:30 - these can be virtual events these can be
09:31 - real events i recommend both uh even
09:34 - checking out blog posts basically
09:35 - there's anywhere you can get information
09:36 - that will put new ideas that will show
09:38 - you how to do things that will reinforce
09:40 - things you already know you need to be
09:42 - putting the right things in
09:44 - to fuel your learning engine
09:46 - but then
09:47 - one of the most common traps that i've
09:49 - definitely felt myself starting to slip
09:50 - towards at times is you can get in kind
09:52 - of this like um
09:54 - it's kind of like groundhog day but with
09:56 - tutorials where you're just watching
09:58 - someone else build something and then
09:59 - you're parroting them and just like
10:01 - typing out the same stuff and then
10:03 - you're not doing anything yourself
10:04 - you're not actually internalizing any of
10:06 - it you're just copying a bunch of
10:07 - tutorials you're reading a bunch of blog
10:09 - posts but you're not actually you're not
10:10 - actually producing anything if someone
10:12 - asked you to sit down and code even a
10:15 - simple to-do app you would freeze or you
10:17 - get stuck or you'd have to go find
10:19 - someone else's finished work which isn't
10:20 - what you want you want to be able to
10:22 - understand and internalize the
10:23 - fundamentals enough to do great work
10:25 - yourself and so
10:26 - you need outputs right you need to
10:28 - create a forcing function
10:31 - uh for yourself to ship and when i say
10:33 - forcing function
10:35 - this is something
10:36 - that is like an external pressure or
10:38 - something that that
10:40 - helps motivate you to actually get
10:42 - something done it can be
10:44 - like a mentor who holds you accountable
10:45 - it can be a small group it can be
10:48 - like a deadline that you give yourself
10:50 - to make sure that you actually follow
10:52 - through otherwise when things get hard
10:54 - you'll just stop you'll put it aside
10:56 - you'll think maybe i'll get to this
10:58 - later i'll learn this the right way to
11:00 - do something later uh but the reality is
11:02 - you don't always get there and then
11:04 - you're stuck so we don't want uh that
11:07 - situation either
11:08 - so this can look different for for every
11:10 - person it will look different for every
11:11 - person but for me um some of the inputs
11:14 - that really helped me uh first one was
11:17 - uh okay coders if and this is a
11:19 - phenomenal program if you're in the
11:21 - oklahoma city area okay coders is is
11:23 - like a
11:25 - a boot camp kind of so it starts out at
11:26 - like html and css and goes into
11:28 - javascript and you have some projects
11:30 - that you work towards at the end and you
11:31 - work with the team
11:33 - and you're taught by real developers in
11:34 - the community and so it was great just
11:36 - for me as kind of like it was actually a
11:38 - little bit of both i got to
11:40 - learn some of the fundamentals i got to
11:43 - practice them and i was motivated and
11:45 - excited enough from that input of being
11:47 - in that class a couple times a week to
11:49 - go on home and practice every single
11:51 - night and reinforce that learning habit
11:53 - which makes a huge difference i can't
11:55 - tell you how many of my teammates were
11:57 - so excited um
11:59 - but they just didn't do the practice at
12:01 - home and so some of it just didn't stick
12:03 - which is so frustrating uh because i
12:06 - know like before
12:07 - the last couple years i started and
12:09 - stopped a few times because it just
12:11 - hadn't stuck
12:12 - so it's super easy to slip into but if
12:14 - you can get excited enough and then have
12:16 - that forcing function of hey we got this
12:17 - big project hey i get out gotta show
12:20 - this this new thing i'm working on at
12:22 - next week's class it'll force you to
12:24 - ship it'll force you to get stuff done
12:26 - and that can be invaluable
12:28 - tutorials can be great i learn really
12:30 - well by like watching videos and then
12:33 - putting it aside and like doing it on my
12:34 - own and that's my learning style but
12:36 - it's going to be different for every
12:38 - person so figure out what works well for
12:39 - you if it works to like go through and
12:41 - just read the documentation and just
12:43 - freestyle it great awesome um if videos
12:46 - work well for you too cool do that but
12:48 - just
12:49 - experiment with a few and figure out
12:51 - what works for you uh as an input
12:54 - podcast can be great i just enjoy
12:56 - podcast anyways and so i'm going to
12:57 - listen to them and
12:59 - they might as well be helping me learn
13:01 - different things get exposed to new
13:02 - ideas um
13:04 - and so it it's just one of those things
13:06 - that doesn't really hurt it's not going
13:08 - to like teach me how to write uh a good
13:10 - function or uh or like organize my code
13:13 - well but it'll expose me to new ideas
13:15 - and keep me excited and motivated which
13:17 - in itself is really valuable
13:19 - and then events i'm going to talk more
13:20 - about events in a little bit but super
13:21 - valuable and there's a lot of stuff that
13:23 - goes along with events that you really
13:25 - can't get anywhere else in my opinion
13:27 - and so i highly highly recommend local
13:30 - and and online events
13:33 - in communities if you're able to get
13:34 - involved with that
13:36 - as far as output the two things that
13:37 - really made a big difference for me is
13:39 - number one uh like mentors
13:41 - i'll talk a little bit about this in a
13:43 - little bit but having mentors who are
13:46 - at the next step ahead of you who have
13:47 - actually done this stuff and can give
13:49 - you feedback and give you some tough
13:50 - love can help you ship stuff is super
13:53 - valuable when you're learning to
13:54 - actually ship this stuff and get it out
13:56 - the door
13:57 - as well as like actual work projects
13:59 - when i was able to take some of the
14:01 - advanced like css stuff i was learning
14:04 - implement little bits of javascript like
14:06 - even at my last job before i joined
14:08 - tailwind getting able to put that to
14:11 - work on projects that the the company
14:12 - was getting paid for was super valuable
14:15 - and so um
14:17 - that the sooner you can get to that and
14:19 - actually work it into your day-to-day
14:20 - work uh the better the sooner you can
14:23 - actually create projects that people use
14:25 - or use yourself that is a huge win so
14:28 - whenever possible i highly recommend
14:31 - aiming for that
14:33 - all right
14:34 - other things uh that help with shipping
14:36 - i'm focusing a lot on shipping um
14:40 - because this is like really the
14:41 - transformational thing that will
14:43 - separate you from like a hey i want to
14:45 - do code
14:46 - i want to be a programmer
14:48 - but just kind of that want to be wishful
14:50 - thinking stage to actually doing it
14:52 - actually achieving it actually being
14:54 - ready for the job or the opportunity
14:55 - when it comes along because reality is
14:57 - like the opportunity can come along but
14:59 - the right opportunity
15:01 - if you're not ready for it will like
15:02 - totally crush you or totally disappoint
15:04 - you because you're not ready for it you
15:05 - haven't put in the hard work of actually
15:07 - i'm actually doing this stuff
15:09 - but if you have it's gonna feel so good
15:12 - um and it's actually easier if you keep
15:14 - doing smaller projects all along the way
15:16 - rather than just trying to cram it in or
15:18 - like just force feed yourself
15:20 - documentation or something like that so
15:22 - some of the stuff that i actually
15:23 - shipped that got me ready for the stuff
15:25 - i do today
15:26 - uh all kinds of stuff but um some of the
15:28 - more original stuff is like i built like
15:30 - a habit tracking app in okay coders
15:32 - which was fun we did like we used like
15:34 - phonegap and cordova
15:36 - um like basically built this like
15:38 - website that would load on your phone
15:39 - and like you could load it in ios and
15:41 - android and that was like super fun and
15:44 - we built this app called like 21 that
15:45 - would help you build a habit over 21
15:47 - days it's super exciting
15:48 - another one that we did actually for
15:51 - tailwind before i joined as kind of like
15:53 - an okay coders project was like this
15:54 - search tool where we took in a bunch of
15:56 - data and we were able to to organize it
15:59 - by categories and make these different
16:00 - pages um for like these certain types
16:02 - like pinterest pins then we could search
16:04 - through it and only return certain pins
16:07 - based on the search query to the user
16:09 - and we used react for that and so is a
16:11 - great way to like
16:12 - cut our teeth on javascript and actually
16:14 - build something that was like really
16:15 - useful um and as an example of the kind
16:17 - of thing that we like might actually
16:19 - build someday tailwind and so that was
16:21 - really exciting there were also some
16:22 - things i did that just kind of scratched
16:24 - my own itch i decided that i wanted to
16:26 - learn to build an api so i just did it
16:28 - um i met with my mentor he gave me some
16:31 - some tips
16:32 - on how to actually do this stuff and i
16:34 - would build some of it show him the code
16:36 - he would show me how to make it better
16:38 - show me the next thing to do okay great
16:39 - you wrote the you wrote it let's write
16:41 - some tests for it let's actually add on
16:43 - to it let's uh create something to seed
16:45 - some data into it and work with the file
16:47 - system doing all these things so i
16:48 - learned a lot on that project i was also
16:51 - just doing these like quick uh projects
16:54 - of like creating a blog or redoing my
16:56 - personal website or making like a random
16:58 - quote generator um and so just these
17:00 - quick and easy like front uh kind of
17:03 - front end stuff
17:04 - that were fun that were interactive that
17:06 - keep you motivated and uh
17:09 - are not that bad to create once you get
17:11 - in the habit of it
17:14 - some other ways to get ideas for things
17:15 - that you can be shipping so you can just
17:17 - ship more because really the more you
17:19 - ship the more you'll come up with ideas
17:21 - the more you'll understand what to learn
17:23 - like this really is like the linchpin
17:25 - habit that helps you that helps make
17:27 - everything after it easier to the 20 you
17:29 - can focus on that'll make the other 80
17:31 - that people normally worry about when
17:33 - they're learning to code
17:34 - so much easier trust me i wish i'd done
17:36 - this more when i was getting started but
17:38 - a few ideas that that i highly recommend
17:41 - uh to my friends when they're learning
17:43 - to code uh one is like pair with someone
17:45 - who actually shipped so if you know a
17:47 - developer if you know someone who
17:49 - actually works on this kind of stuff who
17:50 - is shipping code regularly uh and it's
17:53 - being used by people or or who always
17:55 - comes up with great side project ideas
17:57 - just like get with them and say hey can
17:59 - i just watch you code or hey can we work
18:01 - on this small part of this idea i have
18:02 - together or hey can we grab copy and
18:05 - like walk through this thing i mean
18:06 - actually the faster you can get into
18:08 - real code the better i think i've
18:09 - learned more from actually pairing over
18:11 - real code uh with like the developers i
18:14 - work with than than any other than any
18:17 - other thing that i've done it is
18:18 - insanely productive um if you can it can
18:22 - be kind of scary because you know you're
18:23 - you're like oh i'm gonna have to look
18:24 - stuff up in real time or
18:26 - what if i make a mistake with this
18:28 - person is no way more than me i'll feel
18:30 - really dumb but it's really just
18:32 - something you have to get over because
18:33 - the learning is worth it um
18:35 - it's so worth it
18:37 - another thing that you can do that i i
18:39 - like to try is sort of copying on easy
18:41 - mode so what i mean by this is uh there
18:44 - are tons of apps out there that you
18:46 - probably use every day you know
18:48 - like slack like your to-do list like
18:51 - like yet another email tool um that you
18:54 - know people use these you know people
18:56 - need these
18:57 - um and so
18:58 - it's not really a question of like if
19:00 - this is a good idea or not it's just a
19:01 - question of um
19:03 - can you build this or not like the the
19:06 - mailchimp or slack or like these these
19:08 - super popular apps everyone knows that
19:09 - they want them or even like uber uh what
19:12 - if you could take that app and just make
19:13 - a super simple easy version of that
19:16 - super simplified down or maybe you focus
19:18 - on the design you just break up a small
19:20 - piece what if you just made like a
19:22 - really simplistic version of mailchimp
19:24 - what if you just made a like a clone of
19:27 - uber's like home page what if you just
19:30 - you know you can pull some of these
19:32 - ideas and it can make it sort of easy
19:34 - for you to get started because you're
19:35 - just copying someone else's idea and and
19:38 - putting your own spin on it
19:40 - they're actually holding
19:41 - whole tutorial sites that just focus on
19:43 - sort of this thing of making an easy
19:45 - clone so it's a really fun way uh to do
19:47 - this and it can feel good too because
19:49 - you feel like oh i understand why this
19:52 - company did it this way it's really
19:53 - motivating
19:54 - another thing that i really like is this
19:56 - airbnb 10 to 1 exercise so
19:59 - this is an exercise that airbnb is one
20:02 - of their founders kind of goes through
20:04 - when he's thinking of like a new
20:05 - experience or product to create so he
20:08 - will think of like okay if i'm
20:10 - trying to create like a vacation for
20:12 - someone what is the absolute
20:14 - best vacation they could create like on
20:16 - a 10 out of 10 scale like what is the or
20:18 - like i think he actually goes from one
20:20 - to ten so he'll be like what's the worst
20:21 - experience okay you go to like your
20:22 - airbnb and and nobody's there right and
20:25 - you just leave and you're super
20:26 - frustrated you want your money back okay
20:28 - what's like a good experience like a
20:29 - five out of ten okay they go in there
20:31 - they show your room it's fine it's clean
20:33 - it's a reasonable price good location
20:35 - cool awesome what about like uh like a
20:37 - nine or ten out of ten though there's
20:39 - like a parade when you get in they know
20:41 - your favorite candy
20:43 - like everyone welcomes you in it's like
20:44 - the beatles like rolling into town
20:47 - uh like you get exclusive reservations
20:50 - the finest restaurant kind of the
20:51 - ultimate experience
20:53 - you can do this and then like he will
20:54 - take the like the ultimate one with this
20:56 - crazy
20:57 - like over-the-top uh like experience and
21:00 - he'll pair it down step by step until he
21:02 - gets to something that's between like
21:04 - terrible or very achievable and like
21:06 - exceptional and that's like what he
21:07 - builds um you can do the same thing with
21:09 - your app so if you think like okay i'm
21:10 - gonna make
21:11 - uh you know a
21:14 - um
21:14 - you know a recipe app what is the
21:16 - ultimate recipe app okay it like reads
21:18 - my mind and it like understands like all
21:20 - my dietary habits and what grocery
21:22 - stores are closest to me when it's
21:24 - building my list and it just it
21:25 - integrates with here you can think of
21:27 - all these crazy features you could have
21:29 - and you can strip those away one by one
21:31 - by one and bring it down a level bring
21:33 - it down a level and that can somewhere
21:35 - in there you may find a really unique
21:36 - approach you wouldn't normally think of
21:38 - um
21:40 - that you can still actually build or
21:42 - build a copy of that or build a mock of
21:44 - that or build something and that can be
21:45 - a creative way to get a cool idea that
21:48 - you might not normally think of
21:50 - some other places that you can find
21:52 - great quoting exercises to ship more
21:54 - stuff are our free code camp they have
21:57 - awesome exercises along the way and they
21:58 - also have lots of lessons as i'm sure
22:00 - you guys know if you're checking out
22:01 - this video but if you don't like free
22:02 - code camp projects are awesome that's
22:04 - where i got some ideas like the random
22:06 - quote generator um and there's also if
22:08 - you once you get done you can compare it
22:10 - to other people have done the same
22:11 - project which is also super helpful for
22:13 - javascript 30 by west boss this is one
22:16 - of my absolute favorite courses that i
22:18 - always recommend to people and it's
22:20 - totally free you can go in and he gives
22:22 - you like 30
22:23 - bite-sized sort of project that you can
22:26 - actually ship and make things on over
22:28 - about 30 days and this is insanely cool
22:31 - because it's you don't have to mess
22:33 - around with your development environment
22:34 - or a framework or something crazy it's
22:36 - all vanilla javascript there's some
22:38 - really cool like styling already baked
22:40 - in so you feel good about it and it
22:42 - feels like you're getting some quick
22:43 - wins so highly recommend that course
22:46 - um as like a quick one to get off the
22:48 - ground after you've uh brushed up on
22:49 - some of the basics of javascript
22:53 - the next thing uh
22:55 - it's just like if you were excited about
22:56 - learning something cool if you're
22:57 - excited about learning react or react
22:59 - native if you just really want to
23:01 - understand how databases work and how to
23:04 - work with them
23:05 - come up with an idea that just helps you
23:07 - learn that thing
23:08 - right come up with an idea that works
23:10 - really cool that works really well with
23:12 - react and you're excited about maybe
23:14 - it's totally
23:15 - useless or silly or whatever who cares
23:17 - like just make it
23:18 - and just focus on learning that
23:20 - technology and that's a great way to
23:21 - build your skill set
23:23 - and then the last one one of my favorite
23:25 - ones in the world is like just get paid
23:26 - to actually make things just get paid um
23:29 - i've gotten paid uh
23:31 - to do like freelance projects just web
23:33 - design and baking a little bit of
23:35 - javascript or try out some new css
23:36 - things or whenever i get to to put these
23:39 - things to practice uh at work um
23:42 - it's even better because i you know i'm
23:44 - spending
23:45 - maybe a few days of like you know my
23:48 - nine to five or
23:49 - squeezing a little time on a weekend and
23:51 - like i get recognition for it at work or
23:52 - i can get work resources or i get a
23:55 - chunk of my day that i get to focus on
23:57 - that so and this is especially good if
23:59 - you uh are like really busy or it's hard
24:02 - for you to carve out time on nights and
24:04 - weekends at home
24:06 - sometimes that happens sometimes you
24:07 - have kids sometimes you have a crazy
24:08 - schedule
24:09 - but if you can
24:11 - find a way like work with your boss work
24:13 - with the people um at your company to to
24:17 - get paid to actually learn this stuff
24:19 - and and make something that's valuable
24:21 - for the company to use uh or the client
24:23 - to use do that every time the sooner you
24:25 - can get to that even if it's just you
24:27 - know html and css even if it's just a
24:29 - little bit of simple javascript um
24:32 - that's a huge win
24:34 - because you're getting paid you're
24:35 - growing your skills and then you can
24:37 - level up and start doing more stuff
24:39 - making your own stuff getting paid more
24:41 - to do cool stuff for the same company
24:43 - you never know what opportunities that
24:45 - could unlock but it's been super
24:46 - powerful for me
24:48 - and then uh what to actually learn so
24:50 - yeah i've been focusing more on like on
24:52 - all this obviously on how you learn and
24:55 - the habits you build to learn
24:57 - because i really do believe that's more
24:59 - important than like a specific tech
25:00 - stack
25:01 - once you understand the fundamentals
25:03 - once you learn understand how to do this
25:05 - stuff once it's habitual and automatic
25:07 - and you don't even think about it
25:08 - switching from ruby to php or from
25:11 - javascript to
25:12 - you know whatever the next great thing
25:14 - is isn't going to be such a big deal
25:16 - but that being said it does kind of help
25:18 - to understand the lay of the land and so
25:21 - uh there's this great uh sort of like
25:23 - web developer
25:24 - road map flowchart that's super helpful
25:27 - at least when i was getting started to
25:28 - understand
25:30 - what's out there kind of where am i out
25:32 - of my journey on the front end of the
25:33 - back end and what things can i keep an
25:35 - eye out for or learn about um so that's
25:38 - super helpful highly recommend that you
25:40 - check it out i'm not going gonna walk
25:41 - you through it now
25:42 - but definitely an excellent excellent
25:44 - resource if you haven't checked it out
25:46 - before
25:48 - all right
25:49 - the second habit that i think is super
25:51 - crucial um when you're
25:54 - if you're gonna get your dream job in
25:55 - software uh is i recommend building a
25:58 - three-circle
25:59 - network so what i mean by that is
26:01 - normally when people think about
26:02 - networking they jump straight to like
26:04 - terrible networking events with like
26:06 - platters of food and people are like
26:08 - throwing their business cards at you and
26:09 - just like it's kind of like a i don't
26:11 - know this whole like sleazy used car
26:13 - salesman schtick and
26:16 - you just feel like people are talking at
26:17 - each other but not really connecting
26:19 - yeah nobody wants that um but what i
26:22 - think
26:23 - good networking is
26:25 - is just helping people and being part of
26:27 - the community and giving back and this
26:30 - starts with what i call like your inner
26:32 - circle so i think of it in like these
26:33 - three terms
26:34 - your inner circle uh your professional
26:36 - network
26:37 - and what i call the crowd
26:40 - and so we're going to start with the
26:41 - inner circle what is the inner circle
26:43 - your inner circle when you're starting
26:44 - out networking is like your mentors your
26:47 - peers and the people that you are
26:49 - helping immediately it's like a small
26:51 - core group of people these are people
26:53 - that you can like learn from and lean on
26:55 - for like these 10x big growth decisions
26:58 - uh or trajectory that you're on and like
27:00 - these tough decisions that you're making
27:01 - these are people that can help keep you
27:03 - accountable for your side projects that
27:04 - can help you get introductions for your
27:06 - first job that can
27:08 - um basically you can turn to for honest
27:11 - and helpful and real feedback
27:13 - um
27:14 - got this idea kind of from like a like a
27:16 - five-star general i think i heard about
27:18 - uh and his
27:20 - habit at all times was to have three
27:23 - people in his life one who was a step
27:25 - ahead of him in his career for someone
27:27 - who had done the things that he wants to
27:29 - do
27:30 - who has experience who was wiser older
27:33 - and had value to pass down to him that
27:36 - he didn't know to ask for or and he can
27:39 - turn to that person when when he needs
27:40 - advice when he needs help
27:42 - also someone you respect that is like at
27:45 - your level but it's like best in class
27:47 - it is doing good work that can can keep
27:50 - like kind of light a fire onto you and
27:52 - keep you moving forward and show you
27:54 - what's possible at your level and you
27:56 - can get honest and real feedback that
27:58 - maybe isn't
27:59 - it doesn't make sense to get from a
28:00 - mentor and then of course like you've if
28:04 - you once you get your the next step that
28:07 - you want to take once you get that job
28:08 - that opportunity you get to ship that
28:10 - project it's i really think you have an
28:12 - obligation or an opportunity to turn
28:15 - around and help other people who were
28:17 - who were in your shoes a few months ago
28:18 - or a few years ago and so always being
28:21 - willing to help lend a hand to people
28:23 - and and pass that on pay that forward is
28:26 - i think so critically important and and
28:29 - i think everyone should take the chance
28:30 - to do that
28:32 - uh then there's also your professional
28:34 - network i think this is what most people
28:35 - think of when they think of networking
28:37 - um i tend to think of this just in terms
28:40 - of like who can i ask a favor from with
28:42 - a quick message
28:44 - this is i like people
28:46 - uh from like professional groups people
28:48 - from teclahoma
28:49 - probably or like free code camp would
28:51 - often fall into this i think uh
28:54 - another really critical thing to
28:57 - define in this stage is like a super
28:59 - connector so if you know there's like i
29:01 - have this friend when i was in college
29:03 - named maggie i and whenever we were
29:05 - working on a group project where we had
29:06 - to go like
29:07 - uh we're working on a project we had to
29:09 - go like interview
29:10 - professors or go find other students who
29:12 - knew
29:13 - uh who had specialties with different
29:14 - things i just asked her hey who do you
29:15 - know and she just send me over like a
29:17 - list of like all these people to get in
29:18 - touch with like immediately oh i know
29:20 - brad over here oh i know this professor
29:22 - over here oh i can call them a favor
29:23 - over here they just know all these
29:25 - people you want to know people like that
29:28 - in your industry and be building those
29:30 - connections so that when
29:32 - uh you know if something horrible
29:34 - happens and you lose your job like great
29:35 - you can reach out to that person they
29:36 - can connect you to the right people it's
29:39 - like hey i really need help with the
29:40 - side project i need help with this
29:41 - volunteer thing i'm doing who
29:44 - i don't know who to ask for who do you
29:45 - know you want those people who are super
29:48 - deeply connected especially if that's
29:51 - not your thing you want to know those
29:52 - people it's so helpful classmates family
29:54 - friends relatives former co-workers you
29:57 - know the point here is like you know
29:58 - more people than you think you do
30:00 - a lot of times you tend to discount oh i
30:03 - don't know any people in software oh i
30:05 - don't know any people with the kinds of
30:06 - jobs i want to have but you have friends
30:09 - you have family you have relatives and
30:11 - they might know people like that so feel
30:13 - free to like reach out and and connect
30:15 - with those people and look for the
30:16 - second and third degree connections who
30:18 - can get you in the door who can connect
30:20 - you with a super connector who can show
30:22 - you a professional group that you didn't
30:23 - know about
30:24 - um
30:25 - this is super key to positioning
30:27 - yourself to be able to get that job in 6
30:30 - 9 12 24 months whatever that is
30:34 - and then the crowd this is like who can
30:36 - i meaningfully help today i'm going to
30:38 - talk in a little bit about like sharing
30:40 - your byproducts and sharing what you're
30:41 - learning but the point is this is like
30:43 - social media email subscribers people
30:45 - who visit your website or blog or watch
30:47 - your videos or
30:48 - uh listen to your podcast whatever that
30:50 - thing is but um i i believe that once
30:52 - you like have your mentors and your
30:55 - peers and that close
30:57 - knit inner circle in place
30:59 - and once you have a professional network
31:01 - of of people that you can connect with
31:04 - and and be a part of that you should
31:06 - be like putting stuff out in the world
31:08 - like in your space so if you're like
31:10 - really into react like awesome uh how
31:13 - can you go help the react community how
31:16 - can you build a following how can you
31:18 - you know whether that's on twitter
31:19 - that's on youtube videos or whether
31:20 - that's teaching other people how to do
31:22 - something in your framework like
31:24 - find ways that you can help other people
31:27 - because that is going to come back
31:29 - around when you need it most especially
31:31 - when it comes to to landing a job
31:34 - and a lot of times it's it's hard to see
31:36 - what that'll look like but
31:38 - i've it's pretty
31:40 - people who build that habit of helping
31:42 - people and building a crowd and building
31:43 - an audience
31:45 - it usually comes back around in a good
31:47 - way to help them out
31:49 - and it's a huge advantage
31:52 - uh and this has just like totally
31:55 - been a key factor in like my journey
31:57 - like there's no way i'd be diving as
31:59 - deeply into marketing or software
32:01 - development if it weren't for like this
32:02 - huge crowd of passionate talented people
32:04 - who have like introduced me to new tech
32:07 - uh got me
32:08 - like involved in communities and got me
32:10 - excited about it uh like introduce new
32:13 - strategies uh for projects and code and
32:16 - doing exciting things uh giving me
32:18 - feedback and like blog posts and
32:20 - podcasts and courses and
32:22 - side project ideas and everything uh and
32:24 - like we talked about like actually
32:26 - keeping me accountable the ship work
32:28 - whether it's you know just like
32:30 - a blog post or a video or like putting
32:32 - together an api or whatever it is like
32:34 - having people around you at each of
32:36 - those levels the inner circle your
32:38 - professional network the crowd is going
32:40 - to be
32:40 - a huge help
32:43 - to actually getting stuff done
32:46 - um
32:47 - and there are like lots of other things
32:49 - that i learned
32:51 - in this sort of like networking journey
32:53 - but
32:54 - i think one of the main ones that that's
32:56 - helpful for everyone is just that don't
32:58 - get discouraged when people don't get
33:00 - back to you right away with your
33:02 - follow-up
33:03 - endless follow-up needs to be your new
33:06 - default i think so many times when i was
33:09 - reaching out um about jobs and when i'd
33:12 - meet a great connection for someone i
33:14 - wanted to to learn from uh sometimes
33:17 - they they wouldn't give back to me right
33:18 - away and
33:19 - it was so easy for me at first to
33:21 - attribute that to like oh they don't
33:23 - like me they don't think i'm any good or
33:25 - maybe they're they're just like hostile
33:27 - towards me but usually it's just
33:29 - busyness people are so crazy busy and i
33:32 - know i'm busy so many times uh and and
33:34 - so sometimes i won't get back to people
33:36 - as quickly as i should but it's
33:38 - you know
33:39 - that person might think i'm i'm mad at
33:41 - them but i'm not i'm not i'm just like
33:42 - super busy and if they keep following up
33:44 - i want to help them i want to connect
33:46 - with them i want to get to know them i'm
33:48 - so just
33:48 - making endless follow-up your new
33:50 - default is so critical
33:52 - um to making that happen
33:55 - i got encouraged by this story one time
33:57 - by this the ceo who once followed up
33:59 - with an investor
34:01 - 48 times in a row without a response and
34:03 - then on you know 47 times he you know
34:06 - he'd reach out every few days every few
34:07 - weeks whatever and and he would leave an
34:10 - email leave a message and just didn't
34:11 - get back to him on the 48th time that
34:14 - investor got back to him and said oh
34:16 - sorry i've just had a lot of fires
34:17 - burning i've been super busy uh can you
34:19 - meet tomorrow morning
34:20 - and they met and he invested in his
34:21 - company
34:22 - a lot of times
34:24 - you know people who you want to work
34:26 - with or who are doing great stuff
34:29 - are just super busy and so the more you
34:31 - can
34:33 - do follow up well have that endless
34:35 - follow-up that continual follow-up go
34:37 - the distance with that um to help them
34:39 - out um a lot of times as long as you're
34:41 - not doing that in an obnoxious way as
34:43 - long as you're doing that from a good
34:44 - place
34:45 - um
34:46 - and you're doing it and like doing the
34:48 - hard work
34:50 - of having something to show having
34:51 - something to bring to that meeting um
34:54 - making that worthwhile for both of you
34:56 - um that can actually be a great great
34:57 - experience for everyone involved
35:00 - um and so like this is like a general
35:02 - fault that i scheduled that i've used
35:04 - before um for jobs or getting coffee or
35:06 - just like finding mentors or things like
35:08 - that i'm just like reaching out and then
35:11 - making sure that i follow up like after
35:13 - two days after four days after a week
35:14 - after a few weeks and on and on and on
35:17 - to make sure that i don't let that slip
35:18 - through the cracks and that if uh
35:20 - something doesn't work out it's not
35:22 - because i was too lazy or forgetful um
35:26 - to do them the courtesy of like actually
35:28 - following through
35:31 - all right
35:32 - last habit number three sharing your
35:35 - byproducts this is a super key idea i
35:38 - believe and the reason
35:40 - why why does it matter of like sharing
35:41 - your byproducts and also what does this
35:43 - mean
35:44 - um
35:46 - let me share what this means first so
35:49 - if you're following all the stuff i've
35:50 - talked about you're connecting with
35:52 - people you're you're learning building
35:54 - first you're becoming a learning machine
35:56 - by creating these quick wins by
35:58 - creating the right inputs and the right
36:00 - forcing functions to force you to put
36:01 - stuff out in the world you're going to
36:03 - be learning cool stuff you'll be like
36:05 - you know messing around in javascript
36:06 - you'll be building websites you'll be
36:08 - creating apps you have these great side
36:09 - project ideas you'll you'll learn new
36:11 - things
36:12 - so you'll be creating stuff
36:14 - um and it's tempting to just just let
36:17 - that out and just let that sit you know
36:19 - i shift that thing great awesome move on
36:20 - to the next thing
36:21 - but what i believe you should do and i
36:23 - learned this from like uh this this
36:25 - article from the basecamp folks who are
36:27 - who makes this awesome app um and they
36:29 - put a lot of great blog posts out into
36:31 - the world but about like selling your
36:32 - byproducts
36:34 - um and about like if you are learning
36:36 - these things in real time if you are you
36:38 - the byproduct of that is like hey you
36:39 - have like a cool learning that went
36:40 - along with it
36:42 - uh as you were learning this as you were
36:45 - navigating it as you were encountering
36:47 - new problems and finding new ways to
36:48 - solve it other people would benefit from
36:50 - that if they just knew
36:52 - what you knew if you just documented the
36:54 - things that you learned the things you
36:55 - worked on and put it out in the world in
36:56 - a blog post and a video and a social
36:58 - media post anyway
37:00 - um even a lightning talk and a real
37:02 - person event speaking um that would help
37:04 - someone else
37:05 - and so often people feel like they need
37:08 - to to be a guru right to have it all
37:10 - together to have it figured out so they
37:12 - like put on their creator cap and they
37:14 - feel like they have to be some social
37:16 - media influencer or have to have done
37:17 - this for 30 years and know everything
37:19 - inside and out and write the book on it
37:21 - but that's actually not true you can
37:23 - help people by just documenting your
37:24 - honest experience of what you've been
37:27 - learning and just share that in a quick
37:29 - lightning talk share that in a quick
37:30 - social media post and a tweet another
37:32 - quick screencast and that can help
37:34 - people that is the byproduct of the hard
37:37 - work and the learning that you've
37:38 - already been doing so why not
37:41 - so the reason why
37:43 - sharing your byproduct is so impactful
37:46 - is because it helps others first off
37:48 - um
37:49 - which is so fulfilling and you've been
37:52 - helped by other people's you get to help
37:53 - them too that feels really good it is
37:55 - worthwhile to deal just for that but
37:57 - beyond that when you help other people
37:59 - you end up helping yourself too
38:01 - when you when you help people out in
38:03 - your community they're going to want to
38:04 - help you out too
38:05 - if you help them learn anything they
38:06 - want to hook you up with a new job
38:08 - they'll want to help you on your side
38:09 - project they'll want to help you fix
38:11 - that bug
38:12 - send people your way when you're hiring
38:14 - whatever that is you want to always be
38:16 - helping um
38:17 - and giving back to the community and
38:19 - then it just creates opportunities by
38:22 - showing your work putting it out on
38:24 - github
38:25 - sharing the process of why you built
38:27 - something a certain way that shows
38:28 - people how you think and people will be
38:30 - attracted to that people notice that
38:32 - stuff and then
38:33 - people who some people who might have
38:35 - overlooked you before realize wow okay
38:36 - this person actually knows what they're
38:38 - doing i really want to work with them i
38:40 - really want to hear them speak i really
38:42 - want to to hop on a side project with
38:45 - them or invite them in you never know
38:46 - what's going to happen
38:48 - but people can't discover the cool stuff
38:50 - you're doing if you don't tell them
38:51 - about it it's simple but it's so easy to
38:54 - overlook
38:56 - some practical
38:57 - um
38:58 - ways that this has looked for me
39:00 - uh it's just like whenever i get a
39:02 - chance to
39:03 - public speak i always say yes
39:06 - i it's so
39:07 - it was really like intimidating to jump
39:09 - into it first before i started public
39:11 - speaking it was my number one fear
39:13 - but once i hopped in once i muscled
39:15 - through it like it has been so rewarding
39:17 - and even though it's been scary
39:19 - um i've never regretted saying yes to a
39:22 - public speaking opportunity
39:24 - last year at teclahoma
39:26 - thunderplanes
39:28 - at this conference um
39:30 - i had never done a lightning talk before
39:31 - which is a line attack is like a five
39:33 - minute
39:34 - presentation in front of people kind of
39:36 - impromptu
39:38 - on just one simple idea that you want to
39:39 - share
39:40 - so i gave one on like how to market your
39:42 - side project and how to find great ideas
39:45 - and i gave that talk and one of the
39:47 - people in the audience was a developer
39:49 - at tailwind and so afterwards like he
39:50 - came up to me and said like hey man
39:51 - great talk
39:53 - um and we got to talking about his
39:55 - lightning talk about react and he
39:57 - introduced me to his co-worker
39:59 - and we all chatted uh and then they just
40:02 - introduced me to the ceo of tailwind
40:04 - that went really well
40:06 - and they got me connected with the
40:07 - director of marketing and that got the
40:10 - whole interview process started and i
40:11 - eventually ended up hopping on board
40:13 - their team
40:14 - so it's
40:16 - if you actually connect the dots like me
40:18 - stepping out and giving a lightning talk
40:20 - actually opened the door to me
40:22 - getting like my dream job at a tech
40:24 - startup in oklahoma city um it's kind of
40:27 - crazy to think about like if i would
40:28 - have like sat down and had been too
40:30 - timid to do that
40:32 - that might not have happened or it might
40:33 - not have happened as fast which is is
40:35 - crazy um so
40:37 - again when when it came up my second
40:39 - year thunder planes of course i did a
40:40 - lightning talk and i didn't you never
40:42 - feel as ready as you want to you don't
40:44 - you never feel like those butterflies
40:45 - are like that it gets totally easy or
40:47 - not scary but it's always worth it and i
40:49 - always recommend
40:51 - doing that
40:52 - the other thing when it comes to
40:53 - documenting this stuff is just like keep
40:55 - it simple pick one primary channel and
40:58 - just stick to it if you love being on
40:59 - video just do videos um if you're on
41:01 - instagram all the time give it a shot
41:03 - just do a quick instagram post when
41:04 - you're coding and share what you're
41:06 - working on if you like writing stuff out
41:08 - in blog posts cool awesome that's great
41:10 - uh write a blog post after you finish
41:13 - like learning something or shipping some
41:14 - code
41:15 - do you have some friends and you just
41:17 - like talking about the latest and
41:19 - greatest like
41:20 - uh things in
41:21 - you know python that you're working on
41:23 - cool awesome sort of python podcast and
41:25 - and just document this stuff every week
41:27 - and just have a fun time doing it
41:30 - if you pick that one thing and you stick
41:32 - to it it gets way easier to build a
41:34 - crowd because you're talking about what
41:35 - you already know you have this forcing
41:37 - function of hey i'm going to make a blog
41:39 - post every week i'm going to put a
41:40 - podcast out every week it can be so so
41:43 - helpful
41:46 - another thing that i found is really
41:47 - helpful when you're figuring out well
41:48 - like what can i really talk about i feel
41:50 - like i'm rehashing the same stuff that
41:52 - everyone is talking about we don't need
41:54 - another you know
41:57 - uh to-do list tutorial in javascript
41:59 - okay fine like i get that too like you
42:01 - want stuff that's going to stand out and
42:03 - it's something that only you can create
42:06 - um
42:06 - so
42:08 - at first i say just go back to row one
42:10 - you know always be shipping but beyond
42:11 - that once you get in the habit to or if
42:13 - you need something a little bit
42:14 - different i find this trick of like
42:16 - you're finding your superpower really
42:18 - helpful
42:19 - so this is an idea from like scott adams
42:21 - the creator of bilbert and his his idea
42:24 - is basically that you can could take two
42:26 - skills so for me like i
42:29 - started growing my marketing skills like
42:31 - early on and so i feel really confident
42:34 - that
42:34 - uh like
42:36 - that skills and then i also started like
42:38 - learning the code and software
42:39 - development and building apps and great
42:41 - okay cool so if i take the overlap
42:43 - between those two contrasting
42:45 - specialties that i have those two skills
42:47 - uh i have like marketing and development
42:49 - and so i can combine those and be like a
42:50 - marketing developer and find things okay
42:52 - cool marketing apis and okay cool how
42:55 - can we build a bot that
42:57 - helps people on your homepage and does
42:58 - these cool marketing things cool how can
43:00 - i automate my emails in this cool way
43:02 - that's like a cool marketing thing and
43:04 - you can find things that most developers
43:06 - aren't talking about and most marketers
43:07 - don't know how to do and that can be
43:09 - super valuable
43:10 - so yours will look different than this
43:12 - but you can find uh other things
43:15 - that are in addition to software
43:16 - development and layer them on top and
43:18 - that overlap is what you can talk about
43:20 - that's unique to you and really valuable
43:22 - and showcases uh what you're passionate
43:24 - about and what you're good at which can
43:25 - be make it a lot easier to get started
43:27 - just documenting this stuff
43:29 - another great thing about sharing your
43:31 - byproducts is it makes it so much easier
43:33 - to come up with ideas for things to
43:34 - actually make which goes back to one of
43:36 - the other problems and barriers that you
43:39 - you run into when you're trying to get
43:40 - started creating
43:42 - um
43:43 - and so i found it really helpful if
43:45 - you're putting stuff out in the world it
43:46 - becomes and you have people that are
43:47 - paying attention on twitter on your
43:49 - email list or at meetups it gets easier
43:51 - to like tap your community for these
43:54 - insights as you're ongoing so you can
43:56 - discover pain points right if you're
43:58 - like really involved in the javascript
43:59 - community and you have javascript
44:00 - friends and you're talking about this
44:02 - you can maybe discover a need for like a
44:04 - new package that you could write or a
44:05 - new open source thing you could start
44:07 - if you have an idea
44:09 - if you're starting a following uh for
44:12 - uh like marketers and you're coding
44:14 - things for them uh you can put out a
44:16 - quick tweet and be like hey would it be
44:17 - helpful if i coded this kind of things
44:18 - and you can validate ideas quickly and
44:20 - get feedback from the stuff you're
44:21 - working on uh which can be really really
44:24 - helpful it can help you validate ideas
44:26 - really quickly
44:27 - this is something that i've actually
44:28 - done as well um it's just like i had an
44:31 - idea for a site app that i wanted to
44:33 - work on
44:34 - to
44:34 - uh just like brush up on some coding
44:36 - skills like and so i was like okay what
44:38 - if i can make an app that'll help people
44:40 - meet up for coffee and like sink their
44:41 - calendars and find a free time for both
44:43 - of them
44:44 - so i just put up a quick thing on
44:46 - linkedin because i'm pretty active on
44:47 - linkedin and i get like 41 likes and 18
44:49 - comments i got like a list of i followed
44:52 - up with each and every one of those
44:53 - people one-on-one you can see even some
44:55 - of these people i don't know these
44:56 - people they're second-degree connections
44:59 - and so i was still able to connect with
45:01 - them
45:02 - grab their emails and follow up with
45:04 - them and i didn't actually end up
45:06 - getting as far with that app as i wanted
45:07 - yet
45:08 - um
45:09 - but when i have something to show on my
45:10 - next side project i'm going to plan on
45:12 - like repeating this process and like
45:14 - reaching out making a list and reaching
45:16 - out to people and that way i can i can
45:18 - develop it faster come up with more
45:19 - ideas avoid that block and get more of
45:21 - those quick ones and always be shipping
45:23 - um so and this just came from like
45:25 - documenting the the stuff i was going to
45:27 - work on i didn't i wasn't even planning
45:29 - to post about this side project that i
45:31 - was working on i was like oh it's small
45:32 - it's silly who really cares but more
45:34 - people cared than i thought and so
45:37 - giving this a chance just documenting it
45:40 - and putting it out there in the world uh
45:42 - was a huge advantage and i'm super glad
45:44 - that i did
45:45 - so
45:46 - those are really like the three ideas um
45:49 - in a nutshell that took me from like not
45:52 - really knowing
45:53 - how to code or feeling like i want to be
45:55 - a lot of ways who started to stop so
45:57 - many times to actually getting my foot
45:59 - in the door
46:00 - meeting the right people having the
46:02 - skills built up
46:04 - and and sharing what i was doing to
46:05 - where like i was able to to join this
46:07 - awesome job at tillwind
46:09 - and i love going to work every day i
46:11 - work with some of the best people on the
46:12 - planet and and i'm so happy
46:15 - that i get to do it it's exciting it's
46:17 - fresh it's fun and like i i'm even more
46:19 - excited for like my side projects
46:21 - because the things i'm learning at work
46:23 - like feed into the things i'm doing
46:24 - outside of work in coding and marketing
46:26 - in in the people that i'm meeting and so
46:29 - and and the things the people i'm
46:30 - meeting outside like feed right back
46:31 - into work and make me more excited and
46:33 - it's such a cool place to be and so i'm
46:35 - so glad i started those habits you know
46:37 - like 12 to 18 months ago of just like
46:40 - putting my learning on autopilot
46:42 - building those those networks and
46:44 - hopping in the oklahoma city community
46:46 - uh starting to document my work these
46:48 - things make such a big difference over
46:49 - the long run and so that's my experience
46:52 - um again uh hit me up on linkedin
46:55 - twitter
46:56 - email me whatever i'm happy to talk more
46:59 - about um these ideas and what they're
47:01 - like
47:02 - yeah cool thanks guys so much for
47:04 - listening appreciate it take care
