00:01 - hey everybody it's jesse
00:03 - and i'm making this video today
00:05 - from a bunk bed
00:07 - this is my friend ambrose
00:10 - and this is taggy
00:12 - oh and my robot hand i really love
00:14 - robots
00:16 - all right uh this is my son and uh today
00:21 - i want to talk a little bit about what i
00:23 - did to prepare for my interviews so the
00:26 - last two videos on my channel were about
00:29 - my google interview specifically and
00:31 - then another video just more in general
00:34 - oh my whole experience of interviewing
00:37 - so
00:39 - i had several questions about what i did
00:42 - to prepare
00:43 - so i'm going to go over some of the
00:45 - websites i used and books and resources
00:48 - and i'm going to let you know which ones
00:51 - i think were the most helpful
00:54 - so
00:55 - just to start out i
00:57 - interviewed
00:58 - for
01:00 - front-end developer positions front-end
01:02 - engineer
01:03 - software engineer positions
01:09 - and
01:11 - uh so my
01:13 - it was more front end based for me all
01:15 - of my interviews interview questions and
01:17 - my preparation so depending on whether
01:19 - your front end back end or full stack
01:21 - and what languages you use this may be a
01:23 - little bit different
01:25 - but
01:27 - one service that i think was really
01:29 - valuable was called pramp it's a
01:31 - p-r-a-m-p i'll make sure i put links to
01:34 - everything i talk about in the
01:35 - description
01:38 - so
01:41 - pramp is a service where you sign up
01:45 - and
01:46 - you get paired up with someone else for
01:48 - a time slot so i think it was like an
01:50 - hour time slot in the first half hour
01:54 - one of you
01:55 - takes the role of the interviewer and
01:57 - the other one is the interviewee
02:00 - and then for the second half of the time
02:02 - slot you switch places
02:04 - so
02:05 - it gives you not only do you have a
02:07 - practice question
02:09 - but you also have
02:11 - a time limit
02:12 - and you have someone else that's asking
02:15 - the question that you have to explain
02:17 - yourself to
02:19 - that was really helpful um
02:23 - they have it broken down by different
02:24 - categories so you can just do front-end
02:26 - related stuff
02:29 - data structures and algorithms
02:33 - yeah
02:34 - whoa
02:40 - because of that it stood out as being
02:42 - really unique and and offering something
02:44 - that
02:45 - uh some of the other resources
02:48 - [Music]
02:54 - if you don't have any um experience or
02:57 - like a lot of experiences
03:01 - okay let's be quiet okay if you don't
03:04 - have experience with interviews then i
03:05 - definitely recommend pram um
03:08 - i
03:08 - they may have like a free tier
03:12 - i'm not sure
03:14 - i think it is a paid service but there
03:16 - may be some way to get uh some free
03:19 - things i'll find out and put more info
03:21 - in the description
03:23 - so
03:25 - the next thing that i used that was
03:28 - very very helpful was a book called
03:30 - cracking the coding interview and i know
03:33 - i mentioned this in some other videos
03:35 - and i mentioned it to some of you that
03:37 - asked me questions directly
03:41 - it's a huge book it has a lot of
03:43 - information in it it was written by a
03:45 - woman who actually interviewed a lot of
03:48 - people at google
03:50 - um
03:53 - it goes through
03:55 - and explains
03:57 - what interviewers are thinking what
03:59 - they're looking for when they actually
04:02 - uh interview you and just being able to
04:04 - get into that that mindset of
04:07 - what interviewers are are actually
04:09 - thinking help me so much
04:12 - it helps
04:15 - you know there's
04:16 - there's so many things you could talk
04:17 - about or focus on when you're in an
04:19 - interview uh so just knowing
04:23 - what what these people want to hear
04:25 - is great okay darth vader
04:28 - actually i'm i watched him as fargo
04:33 - and my last name's rigel that's right
04:36 - so
04:38 - and i know
04:39 - his last name
04:44 - oh okay
04:45 - there's also a ton of practice problems
04:49 - and explanations of data structures and
04:51 - algorithms so if you were going for a
04:53 - more general software engineer position
04:55 - or back end position then
04:58 - those practice problems would help you a
05:00 - lot for me it wasn't that helpful
05:02 - because most of my questions were
05:05 - specifically front end javascript
05:08 - related
05:09 - so it was it was still cool to go over
05:11 - some of that info uh don't i don't have
05:13 - a computer science background so
05:16 - a lot of it was new to me
05:17 - so i'm sure it'll be helpful to me at
05:19 - some point
05:20 - but just wasn't so much for uh for the
05:22 - interview so if you're going for front
05:24 - end stuff
05:25 - then i think it's safe to skip over a
05:28 - lot of those sections of that book
05:32 - the next resource that i used and and
05:34 - this is probably a little bit more
05:36 - front-end specific is free code cam so
05:39 - free code camp has some practice
05:42 - interview
05:43 - questions and they also have some
05:46 - kind of less difficult javascript
05:49 - algorithm challenges
05:51 - so i think that's a great way to
05:55 - refresh your javascript knowledge so if
05:58 - you already have a job
06:00 - where you're
06:01 - not
06:02 - coding that much all the time uh you
06:05 - want to get in the habit of of coding um
06:08 - as much as you can before you interview
06:10 - scale up on my cheek right here
06:13 - you can go wash it off if you want
06:16 - fine
06:23 - yeah so
06:25 - i highly recommend free code camp um
06:29 - for a variety of things but in this case
06:31 - for sure for your uh for your interview
06:34 - prep
06:36 - and
06:38 - another resource
06:41 - another resource that i used was
06:44 - javascript data structures and
06:46 - algorithms book
06:48 - i'll put the the official title and link
06:50 - to that below i ended up getting the uh
06:53 - um
06:54 - the ebook
06:55 - so i had that on my phone so i i got the
06:58 - hard copy of the
07:00 - cracking the coding interview
07:02 - but when i was in a situation where i
07:05 - didn't have my hard copy
07:07 - you know but i always have my phone on
07:09 - me then i i could always look at at that
07:12 - so that helped me because it was
07:14 - javascript specific which is the
07:16 - language that i was being tested in
07:19 - so that was
07:20 - it was easier for me to understand the
07:22 - example problems than what i was seeing
07:24 - in cracking the coding interview
07:27 - it was just another explanation of some
07:29 - of those data structures and algorithms
07:30 - which like i said ended up
07:32 - not helping me that much because i
07:34 - didn't really get
07:35 - questions about it but if you are going
07:38 - for something that's that's more full
07:39 - stack
07:41 - position or back end position you may
07:43 - get asked questions about that so
07:45 - i highly recommend
07:47 - that as well
07:53 - [Music]
07:54 - and
07:55 - i i recommend that
07:57 - for whatever books you're using i think
07:59 - it would be a good idea to
08:01 - what about you
08:02 - have an electronic copy of the book
08:06 - so even if you're
08:08 - if you like hard copies that's great if
08:11 - you can only find it in hard copy that's
08:13 - fine and sometimes especially when
08:15 - you're looking at code
08:16 - it's a lot easier to just have a hard
08:18 - copy sometimes
08:20 - but
08:21 - having that
08:23 - on my phone was so useful you know if i
08:25 - was waiting in line waiting at the
08:27 - doctor's office you know i didn't feel
08:29 - like i was wasting time i could always
08:32 - look at that
08:33 - and practice so it just kind of always
08:35 - kept it in my mind
08:37 - and i think that's that's really helpful
08:41 - when you're you just need to be able to
08:43 - always be thinking about code
08:47 - it just it makes it so much easier when
08:48 - you're actually on the spot in the
08:50 - interview you only have a short amount
08:51 - of time
08:53 - you know you're probably a little bit
08:54 - nervous
08:55 - uh so i think it's kind of like master
08:58 - sword yeah it's the master sword from
09:01 - zelda yeah i mean not the master sword
09:04 - but you know a good replica
09:07 - so
09:08 - it's hard
09:11 - i think like
09:13 - like you would approach uh let's say a
09:15 - foreign language you know a spoken
09:17 - language uh with more use you're gonna
09:20 - be more comfortable when you actually
09:21 - get into a conversation with somebody
09:23 - it's the same way with coding
09:25 - um
09:27 - even if you
09:29 - didn't have great resources but you
09:31 - still coded as as often as you could
09:34 - okay little squeaky mouse no we're
09:35 - squeaking
09:37 - if you coded as often as you possibly
09:39 - could
09:41 - that's going to be more useful than if
09:43 - you had great resources the perfect
09:45 - books the perfect questions uh and you
09:48 - only looked over them you know
09:49 - occasionally
09:52 - no more squeaking
09:54 - [Music]
09:56 - so
09:57 - just remember that
09:58 - above everything
10:00 - just practice
10:02 - practice coding
10:04 - [Music]
10:08 - just be be honest okay you don't have to
10:12 - you don't have to be down on yourself
10:13 - you don't have to tell the interview all
10:15 - the things you don't know but on the
10:16 - other hand don't
10:19 - claim that you know things that you
10:20 - don't
10:21 - uh because they'll be able to figure it
10:23 - out
10:24 - really easily right if they say hey do
10:27 - you know how to i can do a front make a
10:30 - network request in javascript you say oh
10:33 - yeah i do it all the time i say okay can
10:35 - you can you do it for me you know write
10:37 - it on the whiteboard
10:39 - well then you're stuck right if you
10:41 - don't really know how to do it so just
10:43 - be honest you could say
10:45 - you know what hey i've done it before
10:47 - but i'm a little rusty on the syntax
10:49 - you know what i've never actually had to
10:51 - do that i kind of know how to how it's
10:53 - done can i just explain it to you i mean
10:56 - um so something like that is is way more
10:59 - acceptable and if you have to just say
11:02 - listen i've never heard of that before
11:05 - you say it
11:06 - um and you can even add
11:10 - which is mina's
11:12 - house
11:15 - [Music]
11:18 - thank you
11:20 - so
11:22 - if you don't know admit that you don't
11:24 - know but then it would be helpful to say
11:26 - listen like if i had to do that for my
11:28 - job here's where i would go to find the
11:31 - answer you know so say i would i would
11:34 - look this up on mdn
11:36 - or something like that
11:39 - and then at least you would you could
11:41 - give some answer even if you have no
11:42 - idea you've at least given some answer
11:45 - uh and said like here's how i would
11:47 - approach this this problem
11:51 - so
11:53 - i think i'm gonna wrap this video up uh
11:55 - that that was my uh my advice let me
11:58 - know what you think if it's too
12:00 - distracting
12:02 - my little friend here for the video or
12:04 - if you can't like the distractions
12:08 - yeah say something
12:11 - um i really love like toys and i really
12:15 - like ambrose and
12:18 - i really am spitting it
12:21 - and i
12:22 - eat humans
12:25 - and i really
12:27 - like
12:28 - pancakes and
12:30 - butter and bread and everything in the
12:34 - world
12:35 - let's say goodbye to everybody on
12:36 - youtube would you like to say goodbye
12:38 - bye
12:39 - bye
12:41 - bye
12:41 - that was tighty bye that was me all
12:45 - right
12:46 - see you later everybody hopefully this
12:48 - helped and um
12:50 - give me your ideas for what videos i
12:52 - should do next uh until next time uh
12:55 - have a great day
