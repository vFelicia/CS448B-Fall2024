00:03 - hello my name is kevin and just in case
00:05 - you don't know me normally you can find
00:06 - me over on my own youtube channel where
00:08 - i talk mostly about css with weekly tips
00:10 - tricks and tutorials i am so extremely
00:12 - excited to be here on free code cams
00:15 - channel to bring you this tutorial where
00:18 - we're going to be looking at how to
00:19 - build out this page now this page has a
00:21 - lot of fun things to build out and
00:24 - we're going to have a lot of fun with it
00:25 - because for me i'm a css evangelist i
00:28 - love css and one of my big goals with
00:31 - this not only is to build out this cool
00:32 - page with you but i also
00:34 - hoping to not only show you some of the
00:36 - cool things you can do with css we're
00:38 - gonna have a cool page we're gonna see
00:39 - some cool css stuff but i'm also css
00:42 - gets a bad rap and a big goal of mine is
00:45 - to help you see the light a little bit
00:47 - um i'm a big fan of it i'm hoping my
00:49 - enthusiasm comes through and wears off
00:52 - on you a little bit and helps you fall
00:54 - in love with the css and see that maybe
00:56 - it's not as bad as you might have
00:57 - thought it was if you're one of those
00:58 - you know if you get a little frustrated
00:59 - by it every now and then we're going to
01:01 - be building this out with just some
01:02 - plain old html and css and a little bit
01:05 - of javascript near the end it's a really
01:07 - simple build i'm structuring it this way
01:08 - it's all going to be static files but i
01:10 - want to allow you to do what you want
01:12 - with it so if you're so if you're coming
01:14 - from like reactor view and you're
01:15 - looking for a portfolio you can take
01:16 - everything you're learning in this and
01:18 - apply it to making something like that
01:19 - or maybe you want to just up the game a
01:21 - little bit with a static site generator
01:23 - you want to build this with jekyll or
01:25 - upgrade it with a lemony or something
01:26 - like that and just make something really
01:28 - cool i want to leave the door open for
01:30 - as many people as possible so whether
01:32 - you're just trying to get something
01:33 - together you're just comfortable with
01:35 - html and css we'll be good to go but if
01:37 - you do have these you know if you do
01:39 - want to take this and do something
01:41 - bigger with it or bring in the languages
01:43 - that you know you should have no problem
01:45 - at all doing that now one thing that's
01:47 - really important before we get into it
01:48 - though is i am assuming you already know
01:50 - a little bit of html and css um this is
01:54 - not an introduction to html and css it's
01:57 - for people who've already started using
01:59 - it and you're building your portfolio
02:00 - now so hopefully you've done a little
02:01 - bit of stuff along the way to put into
02:03 - that portfolio so we are going to be
02:05 - looking at using flexbox and grid and
02:07 - custom properties and doing lots of fun
02:10 - things and while we're doing it i'm
02:12 - going to do my best to explain why i'm
02:14 - choosing these options and how they're
02:16 - working and all of that but they're not
02:17 - in-depth tutorials into any of those
02:19 - topics because then this would just drag
02:20 - out forever we do want to keep it as
02:22 - concise as we can i'm not going to skim
02:24 - through it too much but i'm assuming you
02:27 - already have some knowledge on these
02:28 - topics now if you've never used one of
02:30 - those things like custom properties or
02:32 - grid before don't let that scare you
02:34 - away they're not that scary they're not
02:35 - that complicated and hopefully they're a
02:38 - nice introduction in this project for
02:39 - you to get started with them and you can
02:41 - take what you learn here and start
02:42 - applying it outside of this project as
02:44 - well now if you want to be able to
02:46 - access this project you can use the link
02:48 - that you're seeing right here on the
02:49 - screen right now that link will bring
02:51 - you to an adobe xd file and i want to
02:54 - show you a few things with that file so
02:55 - let's go and take a look at it right now
02:57 - so when you click that link you're going
02:58 - to be brought to this page right here
03:00 - where you're going to see the mobile and
03:02 - desktop options to look at so you can
03:03 - choose the one you want to look at let's
03:04 - go check the mobile one out first now
03:07 - one thing i don't like about this is it
03:09 - brings you to this comment view so if
03:10 - you want to leave me a comment you're
03:11 - more than welcome to but you can see
03:13 - here it's even flashing at us it's
03:14 - telling us that we want to come and look
03:16 - at this specs one here now if i go in
03:18 - the specs you can see i can see the
03:19 - colors that i've used so i get the hex
03:20 - codes of stuff you want you can see the
03:22 - fonts that i've used the font weights
03:24 - that i've used and all of that
03:25 - information and you can come through and
03:27 - look through everything there is in here
03:30 - you can click on things to get
03:31 - information you can copy the text that
03:33 - i've used you can get the text
03:35 - properties the font sizes of individual
03:37 - things everything you need for all of it
03:40 - is here now there's obviously like the
03:41 - top and the left property hopefully
03:43 - you're not going to be using those
03:44 - or even the width and the height and all
03:46 - of that but you can get the individual
03:48 - properties actually we should have been
03:49 - looking up here you can see the font the
03:51 - weight the size all of that stuff and if
03:53 - ever you need to go back you click on
03:55 - portfolio website and then we can go and
03:56 - look over here at the full screen
03:59 - version of it and you can get all the
04:01 - different things that you need to get
04:03 - from that so nice and easy to do and
04:07 - you'll also right now it's not set up
04:08 - you'll also be able to download the
04:10 - assets from all of this as well so if
04:11 - you want the images that i've used is
04:13 - but ideally you'd be using your own
04:15 - images anyway and not necessarily these
04:16 - since this would be your portfolio site
04:19 - but if you want the sizes or stuff like
04:20 - that the link should unlock all of that
04:22 - for you and you should be able to
04:23 - download the assets if you want them so
04:25 - now we know everything we need to know
04:27 - to get started what are we waiting for
04:29 - let's go
04:33 - all right so here we are about to start
04:35 - the project i'm so excited because i
04:36 - love starting new projects so what we're
04:38 - going to be doing in this is just
04:40 - setting the very basics of it up and one
04:42 - part of that just really quickly is i
04:44 - have supplied all of the images here in
04:46 - the images folder so those are the ones
04:48 - i will be using if you don't want to be
04:50 - following along within scrimba you want
04:52 - to be doing this on your own in your own
04:54 - code editor or having your own files
04:56 - what you can do is um in your scribble
04:58 - editor you can click on the little gear
05:00 - icon that you see there when you click
05:02 - on that you'll get some options one of
05:03 - them is to download the zip and when you
05:05 - download that it will give you all of
05:06 - the images along with any code that i
05:08 - have on the screen when you hit that
05:10 - download zip so if you do want to
05:12 - download it later on when i have some
05:13 - work done to compare to what you've done
05:14 - you can also do that if you run into any
05:17 - issues or something like that if you are
05:18 - coding it on your own or if you work
05:20 - completely in the scrumba editor and
05:22 - then you want to download all the files
05:24 - at the end you can do that this could be
05:25 - something you're doing with your own
05:26 - images you don't have to be using mine
05:28 - and you know if this is for your
05:29 - portfolio please use your own images and
05:32 - set everything up the way you want to be
05:33 - setting it up um so we do have a few
05:35 - things we're going to have to do to
05:36 - start this up so the basic document
05:39 - structure here we're going to need our
05:42 - doctype html
05:44 - and we need an html open and html closed
05:48 - just like that now if you want you can
05:50 - also come on your html and set the
05:52 - language to be english or if you're
05:54 - setting up your site for another
05:55 - language of course you can go ahead and
05:57 - do that to whatever language your
05:58 - website is in it's not 100 essential to
06:01 - do that but it does help things know
06:02 - what language your website is in
06:05 - of course we're going to need a head so
06:07 - we can do our open and closed head and
06:09 - we're going to need a body and we can
06:11 - close our body like that so for the rest
06:14 - of this video we're going to be working
06:15 - in the head and then in the next one
06:16 - we'll
06:17 - graduate off into the body of our
06:20 - document um so if we come and look here
06:22 - the first thing i'm gonna do is a meta
06:24 - tag for the car set
06:26 - of utf-8
06:29 - that's just pretty much standard and
06:31 - there is one more meta tag we're going
06:33 - to need here which is our viewport so
06:35 - name is equal to viewport
06:39 - and we're going to do some content in
06:41 - here and our content is going to be
06:43 - equal to width
06:45 - equals
06:46 - device
06:47 - width
06:48 - comma
06:50 - initial
06:51 - scale is equal to 1.0 this is to make
06:54 - sure that your
06:55 - website actually functions properly on
06:57 - small devices as well as big ones if you
07:00 - do not include this and you open your
07:01 - website on a phone or a tablet or any
07:03 - other mobile device it will be like the
07:04 - desktop site zoomed out on your phone
07:07 - which will just look terrible uh so this
07:09 - just ensures that everything will work
07:11 - responsibly and everything will be great
07:13 - and here we can do our title uh i can
07:16 - call you my dev jane
07:18 - portfolio
07:20 - website the last couple of things that
07:22 - i'm going to do here is i'm going to add
07:24 - a couple of links
07:26 - one of them is going to be to normalize
07:28 - which this is actually already brought
07:30 - in by scrimbus if you're downloading
07:32 - through that little gear icon that i
07:34 - showed you it will come it generally
07:37 - comes with a normalize in there already
07:39 - because scrimba by default uses
07:40 - normalize if you don't know what
07:42 - normalize is it's a css file that pretty
07:44 - much helps even out all the differences
07:46 - between the different browsers because
07:47 - there's not huge ones but there are some
07:49 - differences between them still it irons
07:51 - out some bugs tries to make them all
07:52 - behave in the same way it just makes it
07:54 - a little bit easier to have the website
07:56 - looking the same in all of our browsers
07:58 - and the other thing that i'm going to
08:00 - bring in right now is the link to font
08:02 - awesome so you can actually copy this
08:04 - directly from the scrimba editor here
08:06 - but both of these i have got from
08:08 - cdnjs.com
08:10 - so if you want to get other links to
08:11 - things you can always do that now i have
08:13 - linked to the all thing here of font
08:16 - awesome i'm not going to be doing a deep
08:18 - dive into what font awesome is but we
08:19 - are using it for the social icons down
08:21 - at the bottom you only really need to
08:23 - access the brands one but i'm putting
08:25 - the all here just in case on your site
08:27 - you do want to have access to more of
08:28 - them but if you only need the brands you
08:30 - could always change that over either go
08:32 - to font awesome they can they'll give
08:34 - you a unique link to use that's for if
08:36 - you only want the brands or of course
08:38 - from cdnjs you can also get that brand's
08:41 - link we're also going to need to get
08:42 - into the google fonts as well as our own
08:45 - css file has added links here as well
08:48 - i'm not going to be doing that i'm going
08:50 - to wait until we're writing our own css
08:51 - before we go ahead and do that so
08:54 - because we will be waiting until then to
08:55 - put both of those in for now we are
08:58 - completely done we're going to be moving
08:59 - into the body setting up the header in
09:01 - the next video i look forward to seeing
09:02 - you there
09:06 - all right so here's the entire project
09:08 - that we will be building and just as a
09:09 - reminder you can access everything you
09:11 - need for this by clicking the link that
09:13 - is on the screen right now that will
09:14 - bring you to the adobe xd
09:16 - sort of link file thing that i have so
09:18 - it gives you access to all the text the
09:20 - colors the font information and font
09:22 - sizes the font families all of that if
09:24 - you want to follow along with how i've
09:26 - set it up but of course you can just
09:27 - follow along with what i'm doing as well
09:29 - but it can also make it so you can see
09:31 - it on your screen while we're coding
09:32 - because that can be convenient if not i
09:35 - have also broken the different sections
09:37 - down into different slides that i'll be
09:39 - referencing back to as i'm coding things
09:41 - up but for this first one where we're
09:42 - doing the header only the header has the
09:44 - logo and the navigation in it which is
09:46 - hidden away right now so i'm not going
09:47 - to be opening this up too often in this
09:49 - video but both of those are there and
09:51 - again if you do need to get that link
09:53 - i'm going to link to it in the
09:54 - description of every video so if ever
09:56 - you didn't click on it or you close the
09:58 - tab you'll easily be able to access it
10:00 - again so let's come in here into my body
10:04 - and the first thing we will do is put in
10:06 - a header and i'll close that header off
10:08 - and inside of my header we're going to
10:10 - have a couple of things i'm going to do
10:11 - a div class of logo
10:14 - and close
10:15 - div
10:16 - and inside of there i am going to put an
10:18 - image src
10:20 - is going to go to my image folder dev
10:22 - jane
10:24 - dot png
10:26 - um i am going to put an alt tag on this
10:28 - so that's for my alt text i'm going to
10:29 - leave it blank though and a lot of
10:31 - people think that if you have alt you
10:32 - have to put something on it you need to
10:34 - have the alt there it's important that
10:36 - you have your alternative text but if
10:38 - it's something decorative and a logo
10:40 - it's generally decorative you can have
10:42 - that just as a blank alt like that is
10:44 - perfectly fine you don't need to put
10:46 - logo because if the person hears logo it
10:48 - doesn't help them if they cannot see it
10:50 - in the first place so we can just leave
10:52 - it like that there is no problem
10:54 - whatsoever
10:56 - and then let's come down to here and
10:58 - i've put this in a div because maybe you
10:59 - want to set this up as an svg or do
11:01 - other things with it so um you know we
11:03 - could do a lot of different things and
11:05 - by you know we're always styling the div
11:07 - that it's inside maybe this is text
11:09 - there's different options that you can
11:11 - do i am trying to make this as templatey
11:13 - as possible
11:14 - the next thing we need in here is a
11:16 - button
11:17 - i'm going to give this a class of nav
11:18 - toggle because
11:20 - the name sort of speaks for itself
11:21 - that's going to be the toggle button
11:22 - that we can click on to open and close
11:24 - our navigation and i will give it an
11:26 - area label of
11:28 - toggle navigation
11:32 - because
11:33 - there's no label for it there's no text
11:35 - that tells us what this button is being
11:36 - used for so it is important to put
11:39 - an area label on there to help out a
11:41 - little bit for accessibility reasons and
11:44 - inside of that i am going to do a span
11:46 - class
11:47 - of
11:48 - hamburger
11:50 - close span there's nothing actually in
11:52 - there it's a blank it's just going to be
11:54 - something we're going to style up and
11:55 - make it look like our hamburger because
11:57 - we're going to animate that and do some
11:58 - fun things with it as well last but not
12:00 - least in our header we're going to have
12:02 - our nav itself and i give this a class
12:05 - of nav and you might say that's a little
12:06 - redundant and it kind of is but it's the
12:08 - way i like to work so we're going to
12:10 - stick with it if you don't want to have
12:11 - it you don't need it but when i'm
12:12 - writing my css for the most part i like
12:15 - to be selecting classes
12:17 - and just single classes i'm going to
12:19 - make a couple of exceptions in here for
12:20 - say the logo maybe and a few other
12:23 - things yeah you're going to see that i
12:25 - do like putting my classes on everything
12:27 - and i'm going to be using a system
12:28 - called bem as well and so it would be
12:30 - nav double underscore list and i
12:33 - realized that that might drive some
12:34 - people a little bit crazy having the
12:36 - double underscore there the reason i'm
12:37 - doing a double underscore is with the
12:39 - bem system this is saying that my this
12:41 - list is a com a sub component of my
12:45 - navigation here i will also never have
12:47 - items and have links everything is gonna
12:49 - have a class and it's gonna it just
12:50 - makes it a little bit easier when you're
12:52 - reading the css later to know if
12:53 - something belongs as part of something
12:55 - bigger or is it a modification of
12:57 - something you're going to see we're
12:58 - going to have a few examples of that
13:00 - throughout this project and
13:02 - it's maybe a little bit longer to do a
13:04 - double underscore we're going to have
13:05 - times where there's a double hyphen but
13:06 - it is a choice that i'm making very
13:08 - specifically because a i do think them
13:10 - is i like bem but i also think it's
13:13 - going to make it easy if you want to go
13:14 - into the css later to modify it to
13:16 - quickly be able to identify what you
13:18 - want to change and to be able to change
13:20 - it very fast
13:21 - so in here we're going to have our li so
13:23 - li class will be nav
13:26 - item
13:27 - and then in there we can have our links
13:29 - a href we're going to set these all up
13:31 - after so i'm just going to leave it as a
13:33 - hashtag for the moment and that first
13:35 - one can be our home section and i'm just
13:38 - going to copy this
13:40 - paste paste
13:41 - paste
13:42 - just like that and obviously if you
13:44 - wanted to add or remove sections from
13:46 - this it would be very very easy to do
13:48 - and for our header that is everything
13:52 - that we need so
13:54 - in the next video we will explore the
13:56 - introduction section or that main
13:57 - section that has the picture with the
13:59 - name in it look forward to seeing you
14:00 - there
14:04 - all right so i've decided we're going to
14:05 - be doing the intro section as well as
14:07 - this because both of them are relatively
14:09 - simple so we're going to do both of
14:10 - those in one shot before moving on to
14:12 - the next one um looking at it here it
14:14 - might look a little bit complicated but
14:16 - you know with the green bar you might be
14:17 - going how are we going to do that don't
14:18 - worry about that looking at it we just
14:20 - need to know what are the different
14:22 - pieces of content we have here so let's
14:24 - come here i'm going to put a comment at
14:25 - the top this is going to be introduction
14:29 - um just to try and make it a little bit
14:30 - easier and it could be a bigger comment
14:32 - if you wanted to and we're going to do a
14:34 - section on this so section class is
14:36 - equal to intro
14:38 - and i'm also going to give this an id of
14:40 - home
14:41 - you don't
14:42 - the the id could be different but it's
14:44 - what we're eventually going to set these
14:45 - up and actually we're here so we might
14:46 - as well do it we can set my um link of
14:49 - home right away to work on that so it's
14:51 - the only reason i'm putting an id on it
14:53 - i personally don't use ids for styling
14:56 - things i only use ids for anchors like
14:58 - this or sometimes for javascript
15:00 - functionality and some other stuff but i
15:02 - use my classes for styling i use ids for
15:05 - anchoring because that's sort of what
15:06 - they're good for
15:08 - and close section
15:10 - in this section we have a couple of
15:11 - things we're going to have our h1
15:13 - uh i will give this a class
15:15 - and remember i told you everything is
15:16 - going to have a class on it
15:18 - so it is going to have a class of
15:19 - section
15:20 - title because it is a title of my
15:23 - section but i'm also going to be
15:25 - modifying that a little bit so we're
15:26 - also going to call it my
15:28 - section
15:30 - title
15:31 - intro and i realize again that that's a
15:34 - little bit long people might not like
15:35 - writing all of this and them is a choice
15:38 - that i am making but in this case i do
15:40 - think is a worthwhile case because it
15:42 - makes it really obvious what's going on
15:44 - so the double hyphen here is saying that
15:45 - it's a modifier class so it's going to
15:47 - modify this section title
15:50 - to be a little bit different from the
15:52 - default section title because there are
15:53 - some changes that we do need to make to
15:55 - that
15:56 - so in my section title intro we do have
15:59 - a bit of text in here so most of it i'm
16:01 - going to copy and paste but for now i'm
16:02 - just going to write hi
16:04 - i am because here we do need our strong
16:06 - tag and it's a short bit of text
16:08 - jane smith
16:10 - and close strong and we can
16:14 - whoops there's my close of my h1 there
16:17 - and then we can come in with a paragraph
16:20 - class is equal to section
16:22 - subtitle
16:24 - and i'm going to do a section
16:27 - subtitle
16:28 - intro because it's going to need some
16:30 - modifications on there and we can say
16:32 - front and dev close paragraph
16:36 - and last but not least we do need the
16:38 - picture so we have an image
16:40 - the image is in our image folder and the
16:42 - name of it is dev jane01 so
16:46 - dev
16:47 - jane01.jpg
16:50 - again you can feel free to replace these
16:52 - with your own pictures
16:53 - a different dimensions on these pictures
16:55 - should work okay but if you do want to
16:56 - use it just download everything you can
16:58 - check the dimensions on the picture
17:00 - itself and you should be good to go and
17:02 - that is it for that section
17:04 - so let's come down and do the next one
17:06 - here which will be my services
17:09 - um i like having just a comments at the
17:10 - top of things or sometimes if we have
17:12 - lots of closed divs i might put some
17:14 - comments to say what those are actually
17:16 - closing not that it's hard to navigate
17:18 - but it just gives you a little visual
17:20 - clue when you're scrolling through a
17:21 - whole bunch of stuff where a new section
17:23 - of content is starting
17:25 - so here we can do my section class
17:27 - equals my services could just be
17:30 - services i guess and we'll do that for
17:32 - the id services
17:34 - and come back up into my uh links or my
17:37 - yeah my links here for my navigation and
17:39 - add services there so
17:41 - this is going to link with the id down
17:43 - here
17:44 - and we can close that section off
17:47 - and inside that section uh let's just go
17:49 - quick take a quick look at what we want
17:52 - so we have a title with a little
17:53 - underscore on it so that's going to be
17:55 - another little modifier class because
17:56 - we're just going to do that as a pseudo
17:57 - element on the title and then we need
18:00 - three columns and a button down at the
18:01 - bottom
18:02 - we can have an h2
18:04 - class
18:05 - is equal to section
18:07 - title
18:09 - and that will be a section
18:12 - title services uh what i do close h2
18:17 - and so that's going to be the title the
18:20 - we can control the color the underline
18:21 - with the pseudo element all on there and
18:23 - then we need to have three columns so
18:25 - for the three columns here i'm going to
18:27 - do a div class
18:28 - of services so that's going to help us
18:31 - create the three divs or the three
18:33 - columns that we need and inside each one
18:36 - of those i will have a div class
18:38 - called service so it's my individual
18:40 - service
18:44 - we can close that div and inside each
18:46 - one of those we'll have an h3
18:48 - close h3 and each one will also have a
18:51 - paragraph i'm going to put a comment
18:53 - here close
18:55 - close
18:56 - service
18:58 - because we will have a whole bunch of
19:00 - divs and the indenting on that is a
19:02 - little off
19:05 - so copy
19:07 - paste paste
19:09 - and i'll come through and do the text on
19:11 - that off screen afterward we do i forgot
19:14 - to close my services so we can say that
19:17 - that's my
19:18 - close services and then here i need to
19:21 - have an a href is equal to i don't know
19:24 - what we'll call it yet that'd be my work
19:26 - we can probably just call it work
19:28 - and then the
19:31 - class will be equal to btn
19:34 - and
19:35 - close a
19:36 - and in their my work
19:38 - uh so that is the structure that we're
19:41 - are going to need for that section when
19:44 - we're off screen i will come through and
19:46 - put all the text in so when you start
19:48 - the next video everything will be
19:49 - exactly the same but the text will be
19:51 - there and we can continue on with the
19:53 - next section we have in the site
19:58 - all of the text is in place i also
19:59 - forgot the closing paragraph so those
20:01 - are also there now and we can move on to
20:04 - the next section of our site so that one
20:06 - will be
20:07 - let's just call it about me
20:09 - and let's go take a look at what we're
20:11 - going to need for this one so uh just
20:13 - like the title up above it is pretty
20:15 - simple uh there might be a few things in
20:17 - here you may not be sure about but the
20:19 - overall organization and structure of
20:21 - this one's pretty simple the next one
20:23 - will be too so we're just going to
20:24 - finish off all the html in this one
20:26 - because there isn't too much to do and
20:28 - then we can get into the fun part which
20:29 - is our css
20:31 - so here we need a new section class will
20:33 - be about me
20:35 - and we can give it the id is equal to
20:37 - about
20:38 - i am canadian so boot
20:40 - boot me uh let's might as well come up
20:42 - right now and link that
20:44 - about and i think this one will just
20:46 - call it work so we'll put that in right
20:48 - away
20:49 - that's what we've already had that set
20:51 - up for our link there so that is good
20:53 - close section
20:55 - and inside this section what do we have
20:58 - we have another title so h2 we're going
21:00 - to see this a lot class is equal to
21:02 - section
21:04 - title and then section
21:06 - title
21:07 - about
21:09 - this one is who i am
21:11 - close h2
21:13 - we will throw our paragraph on here for
21:15 - a subtitle so class is equal to
21:18 - section
21:19 - subtitle
21:20 - and section
21:22 - subtitle
21:24 - about
21:25 - close
21:26 - a
21:27 - closed paragraph
21:29 - some people like using headings as
21:30 - subtitles but in general it's kind of
21:33 - frowned upon heading sort of the next
21:35 - level of content so you have your h2
21:37 - then if you had like a subsection to
21:39 - your h2 and you had a several h3s that
21:41 - would make sense a little bit like here
21:43 - we have our what i do is the section and
21:46 - then we have subsections we have design
21:48 - and development we have e-commerce we
21:49 - have wordpress so by having those
21:52 - different sections in here that's more
21:54 - what a heading is used for
21:55 - it's less a title and then a subtitle so
21:58 - just using a class on a paragraph is
22:00 - generally um a little bit of a better
22:03 - way to do it you could also if you
22:04 - wanted to actually put in a new header
22:07 - and
22:07 - close header
22:09 - for each one of these sections
22:11 - for every single section like that as
22:13 - well so you're saying this is the header
22:15 - for that section i'm not going to bother
22:16 - with that but if you wanted to it's you
22:19 - know it it's very valid to work that way
22:22 - as well um so in there we have that and
22:24 - then i'm gonna have one more thing i'm
22:26 - gonna have a div class
22:28 - equals uh we'll call it about
22:31 - me
22:31 - body so it's like a subsection once
22:33 - again that's why we have the double
22:34 - underscore here we have about me and
22:36 - then this is a subsection to that so um
22:39 - or it's a component of
22:41 - my about me so i'm putting a div that's
22:44 - why we have the double underscore there
22:46 - and then in that div we're going to put
22:47 - in the paragraph or we have two
22:49 - paragraphs of text close paragraph
22:52 - um this is important that and you know
22:55 - you could technically get up to five
22:56 - paragraphs in here or have only one
22:58 - paragraph if you wanted to and it
23:00 - wouldn't cause any issues whatsoever um
23:02 - but it's important that we group it all
23:04 - together just to be able to handle
23:05 - exactly where it's going to go inside of
23:07 - this section
23:09 - and then after that we have one more
23:10 - thing we're going to need which is our
23:11 - image
23:12 - i don't know if it's really a bus but
23:14 - we'll stick with that and that's image
23:16 - dev jane.02.jpg
23:21 - there we go so that is good closed
23:24 - section
23:26 - and as i mentioned we're going to finish
23:27 - off all of the html for this one
23:31 - so this is going to be my work
23:34 - my work
23:35 - uh this one's gonna be pretty simple so
23:37 - ser section
23:39 - class will equal my work
23:42 - id we said would be work
23:45 - um so in here we'll once again we're
23:47 - gonna need our h2 class equals section
23:51 - title i don't know if we're going to
23:52 - need to have a
23:55 - modifier class on that so i'm going to
23:57 - leave it like that right now we might
23:58 - need one to change the color of it
24:00 - because the color of this one is going
24:02 - to be white and that's a little bit
24:04 - different
24:05 - [Music]
24:07 - we're going to see but
24:09 - and actually i'm looking at it now
24:11 - because these have a background on them
24:13 - and this one doesn't we might be coming
24:15 - back in here to make some small changes
24:17 - later on
24:19 - but for now let's leave it like this and
24:21 - also i haven't put any text i'll do that
24:23 - off screen so you don't have to see me
24:24 - copying and pasting
24:26 - class is equal to section
24:28 - subtitle and the
24:30 - part that's going to be the most
24:32 - important here is we're going to put in
24:33 - a div class we're going to give this a
24:35 - class of portfolio
24:38 - inside the portfolio we're going to have
24:40 - each one of them is going to be an a
24:42 - we're going to replace the href on this
24:44 - eventually but for now we'll just put a
24:46 - hashtag
24:47 - with a class of portfolio
24:50 - portfolio portfolio
24:54 - double underscore item because it's the
24:56 - individual item close a
24:59 - and then inside each one of those links
25:00 - we will have an image
25:02 - src i'll put the first one portfol
25:05 - can't spell portfolio today
25:06 - portfolio01.jpg
25:09 - alt i'm going to leave blank for now but
25:10 - that could be something you fill in on
25:12 - your own if you want to put a little
25:13 - description of what the project is
25:16 - and uh the class on each one of these
25:18 - will be portfolio double underscore img
25:21 - because it's the portfolio image
25:23 - portfolio portfolio
25:26 - item zero one i'm going to speed this up
25:28 - as i do it because i think a little
25:30 - comment on each one of these will make
25:31 - it easier when you're setting everything
25:33 - up
25:34 - all right so that is done let's hit save
25:36 - because i haven't saved yet and let's
25:37 - see
25:38 - hopefully everything is actually showing
25:40 - up on here so it looks like everything
25:42 - is there we didn't get any errors my
25:44 - images are all loading in so we're off
25:46 - to a good start on all of that i'm going
25:48 - to close that off because we don't
25:49 - really need it right now and last but
25:52 - not least
25:53 - footer awesome we're right at the end
25:55 - the footer is pretty straightforward so
25:58 - we can do footer close footer
26:01 - and in here we're going to have a couple
26:02 - of things we need an href of mail 2. i'm
26:06 - going to hello at
26:09 - dev
26:11 - with a we'll put a comment down here a
26:12 - head class is also gonna be footer link
26:16 - and
26:17 - that can just say hello at jane.dev
26:21 - close a
26:22 - uh replace replace with your own email
26:27 - address
26:29 - right uh so there you can just make sure
26:31 - that this and this here are your own
26:33 - email address if you are planning on
26:35 - using this for your own site ul we can
26:38 - have a class of social
26:40 - [Music]
26:42 - social list
26:44 - close ul
26:45 - i'm not doing this as like a footer
26:46 - thing and bill this is my footer link
26:48 - and actually that should be a double
26:50 - underscore on there
26:51 - i'm not doing this because technically
26:53 - it could be something that could be used
26:54 - in other places it doesn't necessarily
26:56 - have to be in the footer
26:58 - so i'm not calling it like footer social
27:00 - list or something like that but it could
27:02 - be if you wanted it to
27:04 - we're gonna have an li with an a in it
27:06 - close
27:08 - bay
27:09 - close l i
27:11 - the list item itself will have a class
27:14 - you guessed it of social
27:16 - social
27:18 - list item it's gonna be a lot like our
27:20 - navigation class is equal to
27:23 - social
27:25 - list
27:26 - link
27:27 - um this is a place where you could have
27:30 - another class on this also of like
27:32 - unstyled list that you could use for
27:34 - both of them and just remove you know
27:36 - because both of them there's a lot of
27:38 - similarities between the two lists and
27:39 - then on top of that they'll have some
27:41 - modifications to it so if you wanted to
27:43 - take that approach to it instead of the
27:45 - way i'm doing it here that would be
27:46 - perfectly acceptable and result in a
27:48 - little bit drier code in the long run
27:50 - so i'd be all for that
27:52 - um for now let's put some hrefs on these
27:55 - they're just going to go to the generic
27:57 - site so i'm going to speed this up while
27:58 - i put them all on
28:00 - all right and there we go and you'll see
28:01 - before now i've just put an abc
28:04 - we should have a d on that last one what
28:05 - did i do wrong i put the d in the wrong
28:07 - spot um so a b c d as the links because
28:10 - when i put in the font awesome i bring
28:12 - i'll explain a little bit of how that's
28:14 - working uh just in case you want to
28:16 - change it out for your own icons so when
28:18 - we do the footer i'll go into more
28:20 - detail on that for now that is
28:22 - everything we'll probably be jumping
28:23 - back into the html a little bit as we
28:25 - write our css just in case there's a
28:27 - thing or two along the way that we need
28:28 - to add but for the most part that is
28:30 - done that is the structure of everything
28:32 - we need so from there we can go ahead
28:35 - and start styling this up the fun parts
28:36 - are starting in the next video
28:41 - alright so we're going to be jumping
28:43 - into actually styling things up which is
28:44 - always the most fun if you want to get
28:46 - the different font information the
28:47 - weights the colors the sizes all of that
28:49 - and just the colors in general that i
28:51 - used in this you can click here once
28:53 - again to get to that adobe xd link
28:56 - now to get started on this in this video
28:58 - we're just going to be setting up some
28:59 - of the general things i'm going to be
29:00 - doing a lot of css custom properties in
29:03 - here if you're not super familiar with
29:04 - them they're going to make sense pretty
29:06 - quickly so we're going to be starting
29:08 - with that we're going to be setting up
29:09 - our basic fonts and getting all of that
29:12 - set up in this one
29:14 - so um the first thing we need to do is
29:16 - actually create a css file so if you're
29:18 - in your own code editor you can do that
29:20 - how you're used to doing if you're
29:21 - following along here in scrimba you can
29:24 - right click in scrimba where it says
29:26 - files and you can make a new file there
29:28 - and actually before i do that i'm going
29:30 - to make a new folder called css and then
29:32 - inside my new css folder i'm going to
29:34 - make a new file called style.css
29:37 - and we can get started in here but
29:40 - before we write anything nothing will
29:41 - show up because we're not linked so i'm
29:42 - going to come down here
29:44 - and link to my own css file
29:47 - css and just so we can make sure that
29:49 - it's all working why don't we come into
29:50 - there and say
29:52 - body background is red and see if that
29:56 - worked so i'll save that file i'll save
29:58 - the changes i made there and now we can
30:00 - see that my body is definitely coming in
30:02 - as red so that is fantastic now really
30:05 - quickly before we move on you might have
30:07 - noticed there was a white background on
30:08 - that if you did download these images
30:10 - and you want to follow along with
30:11 - exactly these ones you might have to
30:13 - download again just there was a weird
30:15 - white box on that that had a bit of a um
30:17 - extra spacing on it because of the
30:19 - shadow that i put on i have removed it
30:21 - it is updated i'm really sorry about
30:23 - that you can grab the new images now if
30:25 - you are following along but again i'm
30:26 - assuming that you're doing this using
30:28 - your own images to replace these ones
30:30 - but that has been fixed so if you want
30:32 - to download the images again you can do
30:34 - that sorry once again and we can now get
30:37 - rid of our body background red on that
30:39 - hit save and we can see that that has
30:42 - disappeared now before we actually start
30:44 - writing any css i am going to do one
30:46 - more thing where i'm going to come in
30:47 - here and put a link to the google fonts
30:49 - that i used in my document or in my
30:51 - design
30:52 - so
30:53 - update these with your own fonts if you
30:57 - do now if you like the fonts i've used
30:59 - these are the ones i'm going to be using
31:00 - the first one is the source saws the
31:02 - code version which is the
31:04 - monospace font that was here i only use
31:07 - the regular but i want to make it really
31:08 - easy for you to update so if you did
31:10 - want to switch this out for like the 300
31:12 - or the 500 or whatever it is you can
31:13 - just update the numbers here or add new
31:15 - numbers to it and the same thing i'm
31:17 - using the light and the black but if
31:18 - ever you need it more you could just
31:20 - change those numbers or you can go over
31:21 - to google fonts just switch this out
31:23 - completely with the ones you want to be
31:24 - using we're also using a whole bunch of
31:27 - custom properties so it's going to make
31:28 - it really easy for you to update this
31:29 - all the fonts throughout the whole site
31:31 - but you might have to just switch out
31:33 - that link right there
31:34 - with the fonts you want to be using to
31:36 - do it um so coming into here the very
31:38 - first thing i am going to do is a star
31:41 - comma star
31:43 - before comma star
31:46 - after
31:47 - to set up my box sizing border box
31:50 - because i do that on every single
31:52 - project it just makes our life so much
31:54 - easier
31:55 - if you're not too sure about box sizing
31:56 - border box it's just changing how
31:58 - padding is calculated to make it within
32:00 - a width instead of adding on to the
32:01 - total width of something it just makes
32:03 - our lives so much easier when we're
32:04 - setting things up uh the other thing i'm
32:06 - gonna do is come on here on my route to
32:08 - set up some custom properties so the
32:11 - first thing i'm do is have a font family
32:13 - of um if this was my own project i'd
32:15 - probably call it font family sauce and
32:16 - then font family code or font family
32:18 - mono or something like that because i do
32:20 - want this to be something that could be
32:22 - used for other purposes i am going to
32:24 - call this font family primary
32:26 - and a font family secondary uh just in
32:29 - case you end up using different fonts
32:31 - from what i'm using in here i do think
32:33 - that makes the most sense to do um so my
32:36 - primary one is my sources pro so we can
32:40 - bring that in right there and my
32:43 - code is
32:45 - that one right there i'm just copying
32:46 - and pasting these directly from google
32:48 - fonts the next thing i'm going to do is
32:50 - set up my font weight so i'm going to
32:51 - have a font weight of regular uh which
32:53 - is going to be my 300 and a font whoops
32:55 - that should have a double hyphen
32:57 - and here font weight of bold which will
33:00 - be my 900 now if you're not used to
33:02 - custom properties you haven't used them
33:03 - this is not like them where i'm doing
33:05 - this out of you know just for fun this
33:07 - is how custom properties do you have to
33:09 - work with the double hyphen on here
33:11 - we're gonna have a color of a background
33:13 - which is just gonna be my fff
33:15 - we'll have a color
33:17 - text
33:18 - which is my 30 30 30.
33:22 - um actually a lot of time i'll do that
33:23 - but i'm going to call this color light
33:27 - color dark because again we might want
33:29 - to be doing this uh you might want to
33:30 - change these colors around for your own
33:32 - design and a color accent
33:34 - which is my
33:36 - 16e 0
33:38 - bd which is the main greenish color that
33:41 - i use throughout this whole site and
33:43 - we're going to set up some font sizes so
33:44 - i'm going to say a font size of h1
33:48 - of 3 rem i always set my font sizes in
33:50 - rems font size h2 2.25 rem
33:54 - font size
33:56 - h3 will be 1.1
33:58 - uh sorry 1 2 5 rem these are all things
34:01 - i calculated already based on my mockup
34:04 - and just playing around a little bit
34:05 - with it we'll stick with one ram on my
34:07 - body
34:08 - and
34:09 - the nice thing with font sizes are the
34:12 - nice thing with um
34:14 - if you've ever used something like sass
34:15 - where you've set up using variables
34:18 - variables are awesome they're amazing
34:19 - but these css native ones are great
34:22 - because you can actually change them
34:23 - within a media query which is not
34:24 - something you could do
34:26 - inside of sas or less or any of those
34:29 - other ones you might have been using
34:31 - i'm going to be setting up a pretty
34:32 - generic media query here of 800 pixels
34:35 - but i do think it works well for this
34:37 - design
34:38 - but it could be something that you could
34:39 - look at changing in your own if you find
34:41 - that it's not working but i think it's
34:42 - going to work well for what we're doing
34:43 - here
34:44 - and what i'm going to do is redefine my
34:46 - font sizes here to make them bigger at
34:48 - larger screen sizes
34:50 - so we have our font size h2
34:52 - 3.75 ram
34:55 - font size h3 will be 1.5 ram
34:58 - and my font size body will be 1.125 rem
35:03 - and that way at once we hit this
35:06 - we don't have to redefine it within our
35:08 - actual css these are being redefined
35:10 - here so everything should just magically
35:12 - change for us as long as it's been
35:14 - properly set up using those so that we
35:16 - can come all the way to here and i can
35:18 - just put custom properties
35:21 - update these for your own design
35:26 - and whoops that's i'm so used to
35:28 - we need comments that look like this
35:31 - there we go uh custom properties there
35:34 - we go and then we can do
35:36 - uh general styles so in my general
35:39 - styles what are we gonna do let's just
35:40 - make some room here and then come back
35:42 - up
35:43 - so the first thing we're going to select
35:45 - our body
35:46 - and i'm going to set the background on
35:48 - here of var
35:50 - color
35:51 - light
35:52 - so let's hit save and the nice thing
35:54 - with this with the custom property is
35:55 - now if you decide to change the color of
35:57 - it so you can see right now we have the
35:58 - white background on there but if i
36:00 - change this to let's say accent
36:02 - it's going to change the background
36:04 - color to everything to accent like that
36:06 - where the accent color is coming in or
36:08 - if we change it to dark we can quickly
36:10 - change the color scheme of our whole
36:12 - site so let's bring that back up to
36:14 - light for now and then so we have light
36:16 - on there our color will be our var color
36:18 - dark so if you needed to change anything
36:20 - you can just invert that and all of a
36:21 - sudden you'd have a dark color scheme
36:23 - which
36:24 - we're going to sort of be using when we
36:25 - get down to that at least to change the
36:26 - font colors or when we get to my work
36:29 - area we can easily set that dark
36:30 - background on it just like that
36:33 - uh other things on here we're going to
36:34 - want to set we do have
36:37 - a margin of zero
36:39 - we'll put our font family on here uh
36:42 - we're going to put our var
36:44 - font family primary on there we're going
36:46 - to have our font size var font size body
36:50 - and now you can sort of see where that
36:52 - fs or fw and all of that that i used
36:54 - along the way why i did it i'm going to
36:56 - line height i use a 1.6 as sort of a
36:58 - default line height that i like to use
37:00 - on everything
37:02 - um so hit save and we come back we
37:04 - should see a lot of those things coming
37:05 - in the fonts are working and a few other
37:07 - things we're getting there we're almost
37:09 - done with the general setup another
37:12 - general thing that i like to do is just
37:14 - setting my images to have a display
37:17 - a block which gets rid of some issues
37:19 - that sometimes
37:20 - come up with images and also setting a
37:22 - max width
37:24 - of 100 on them just so they don't grow
37:26 - bigger and overflow at the side of their
37:28 - parents
37:29 - next up we're going to come and just set
37:31 - up our basic type
37:32 - typography
37:36 - which is a word i have
37:37 - way too much trouble pronouncing
37:39 - sometimes we're not pronouncing but
37:40 - spelling um for something i read a lot
37:42 - so whenever h1 h2 and h3 are all going
37:45 - to have a line height
37:47 - uh line height of we're going to try 1.1
37:49 - and adjust from there but because
37:51 - they're going to be a bigger font sizes
37:52 - in general if they break on two lines
37:54 - they definitely need the smaller line
37:55 - height on them and i'm going to put a
37:57 - margin of zero for now that might have
37:59 - to get revisited but in general the
38:01 - headings um you want to get rid of the
38:03 - margins and maybe keep a bit of a margin
38:04 - top maybe a small margin bottom but
38:06 - we're just going to do a bit of a reset
38:08 - on there
38:09 - and then on h1 i'm going to set a font
38:12 - size of var and we're going to do our
38:14 - font size
38:16 - h1
38:17 - and you can probably guess what we're
38:18 - going to do for the other ones i'm just
38:20 - going to copy this actually and we can
38:22 - set that up with an h2
38:24 - and that as an h3 and over here we can
38:26 - have our h2 and my h3 so if we save that
38:29 - we can take a look we should have some
38:30 - nice big font sizes
38:32 - everywhere except hmm that's really
38:34 - small let's just go take a look i forgot
38:36 - to put rem here
38:38 - 4.5 nothing will not work
38:40 - so we'll have a nice big font size at
38:42 - large screen sizes but when we get to
38:43 - the smaller ones you can see it's
38:44 - automatically adjusting when i change my
38:46 - screen size and if we come lower down on
38:48 - the site
38:49 - again we should see those titles get
38:51 - bigger and smaller automatically with
38:53 - our media queries so that is really
38:55 - really cool one of the things i love
38:56 - about custom properties they do take a
38:58 - little bit more time to actually set up
39:00 - but then once you're using things and
39:01 - creating things man it can just go so so
39:04 - much faster so i think we're going to
39:06 - end this one here we're going to skip
39:07 - over the header and the navigation for
39:10 - now we're going to come back to that in
39:11 - a little bit because for now i just want
39:12 - to start doing the general typography
39:14 - but for our section titles and subtitles
39:16 - and then we'll sort of go through the
39:18 - site a little bit from there
39:23 - all right so um as i mentioned we're
39:25 - going to do a little bit more typography
39:26 - we're going to have our section title
39:28 - we'll give this a little bit of styling
39:31 - which at the moment i'm not sure if we
39:32 - need to do much on it and we're going to
39:34 - have our section subtitle
39:37 - i'm going to start with the subtitle
39:38 - because there's a bit more of an i'm
39:39 - going to play with that first and then
39:41 - go back into the other one to modify it
39:43 - a little bit so our subtitle here is
39:45 - going to have a margin of 0 just because
39:47 - i think it makes our life a lot easier
39:49 - because remember we didn't do it as an
39:50 - h3
39:52 - this is actually a paragraph and because
39:54 - it's a paragraph the font size on it we
39:56 - do have to modify so the font size will
39:58 - be my
39:59 - var font size h3
40:02 - and you can again start seeing where
40:03 - these variables can be handy you don't
40:05 - have to remember the pixel value you
40:06 - don't have to worry about the media
40:08 - queries or anything like that it just is
40:10 - going to work and then we had our
40:12 - section
40:14 - subtitle
40:15 - intro
40:16 - we also had the section
40:18 - subtitle
40:20 - about that had similar styling on them
40:22 - or they both had a background color on
40:24 - them of the var
40:25 - color accent
40:28 - and the font family for both of those
40:30 - will be my var
40:32 - font family
40:33 - secondary they're probably going to need
40:35 - a little bit of padding on them but
40:37 - we'll come back to the padding in a
40:38 - little bit um we're gonna have to play
40:40 - and modify a lot on these uh as time
40:43 - goes just to get them to line up
40:44 - properly in the spaces let's just go
40:46 - take a look and see
40:48 - i think that's working out pretty nicely
40:50 - actually with how it is right now i'm
40:52 - actually really happy with it i'm just
40:53 - going to play with the spacing on it a
40:56 - little bit just to see because i think
40:57 - it's a little bit tight compared to what
40:59 - the original design was but it's not too
41:00 - bad you can see here the comma is
41:02 - actually touching um that so i think
41:04 - what we'll do is on my section title
41:06 - we'll give it a little bit of a margin
41:08 - bottom of like
41:10 - 0.25 m that'll probably be enough to
41:12 - push it off
41:14 - especially because it's a large font
41:15 - size i always do margins and padding on
41:18 - my text using m's i think it's the best
41:20 - thing it's relative to the font size
41:22 - that way and you can sort of
41:23 - work with it so i think that's really
41:25 - really cool and handy um here since
41:27 - we're dealing with our section titles
41:29 - and everything on my i like to keep all
41:31 - my typography together
41:32 - which is why i'm working this way
41:35 - i'm going to say a font the font family
41:38 - should be my
41:39 - font and not my font family sorry my my
41:41 - font weight on this one should be the
41:44 - regular
41:48 - uh which is awesome except this
41:50 - obviously shouldn't be because that
41:51 - should have a strong on it let me just
41:53 - double check did i put that i do have
41:55 - that on there so let's go and fix that
41:57 - since this should be saying strong
42:00 - typography
42:03 - i'm gonna do it up here i know it's sort
42:04 - of a typography but strong it's a bit of
42:06 - a generic thing
42:07 - font weight
42:09 - is var
42:10 - font weight bold there we go so we have
42:13 - that working um
42:15 - now the question is
42:18 - i'm going to cheat a little bit this
42:19 - isn't something i normally do or very
42:21 - often do but i'm going to actually take
42:23 - my
42:25 - this
42:26 - and say that the strong tag that's
42:28 - nested in there is display
42:32 - block just so the jane smith always ends
42:35 - up on its own line instead of sometimes
42:38 - being
42:39 - on a different line like that so
42:42 - i'm not a big fan of using compound
42:44 - selectors but every now and then once
42:46 - you know the rules you're allowed to
42:47 - break them sometimes so this is one of
42:49 - those times where i think it is
42:50 - perfectly fine to go in there and break
42:52 - it the font size on this does look a
42:54 - little bit smaller than what the
42:55 - original design called for so i might
42:57 - play with that but we'll play around
42:58 - with the overall look and if we still
43:00 - find that it's too small
43:02 - maybe we could even change both of them
43:04 - to be the h2 size instead anyway we'll
43:08 - see we'll come back to that once the
43:09 - design is starting to come together a
43:11 - little bit um but looking at the small
43:13 - screen sizes honestly we're getting
43:15 - close already uh to what we need there's
43:17 - not a ton of work that needs to be done
43:19 - at the small screens to get everything
43:21 - here to work obviously these need some
43:23 - fixing up
43:24 - and overall there is some work to be
43:25 - done but we are getting close um so what
43:28 - we're going to do is we're going to end
43:29 - this video here and then in the next
43:31 - video we are going to go in and set up
43:33 - the grid for this and make this work
43:35 - apple small and large screens
43:40 - now i know you might be wondering why
43:42 - we're not doing the navigation first but
43:43 - i'm gonna come back to the navigation at
43:45 - the end and set that whole thing up
43:46 - because we're gonna have to get into a
43:48 - little bit of javascript and stuff to
43:49 - get that working so i'd rather just
43:50 - stick to css for now finish everything
43:53 - else come back style that and then add
43:54 - the javascript right at the very end
43:57 - um so here what we can do is let's set
43:59 - up a bit of a comment so we'll say intro
44:01 - section and we can start styling it up
44:05 - um so the first thing i'm do is i'm
44:07 - going to give it a
44:08 - position of
44:11 - relative i'm not sure but i think we're
44:13 - going to have some absolute positioning
44:14 - coming onto here
44:15 - so i'm doing that is a bit of a
44:17 - precursor for that let's see now we have
44:20 - i'm actually going to say we're going to
44:22 - turn this off but let's just say um
44:25 - for now i'm going to say nav has a
44:27 - display of none just so it doesn't
44:28 - really get in the way too much we'll
44:29 - keep our logo at the top even though
44:31 - that does have to be smaller
44:32 - but at least it'll give us a bit of a
44:34 - better idea of how everything is going
44:36 - to be looking
44:38 - once everything comes together at these
44:39 - smaller screen sizes and i think
44:42 - actually i'm going to come up before we
44:43 - do anything else
44:45 - typography i'm going to come here to
44:46 - like my general stylings and i'm
44:48 - actually going to give my sections
44:50 - a generic padding so padding will be
44:54 - let's start with
44:55 - say 5m top and bottom 2m left and right
44:58 - the two i might be a little bit big at
45:00 - small screen sizes but we're going to
45:01 - start with that and see what it does
45:03 - the main idea here is it's just going to
45:05 - keep things from touching the side of
45:07 - the screen when we don't want them to
45:09 - um so i'm actually not minding that
45:11 - except the line height here i'm actually
45:14 - going to shrink that down to one because
45:15 - i find the spacing on the lines was way
45:17 - too much i think that is looking not bad
45:20 - but obviously we need to add a little
45:22 - bit of spacing
45:23 - on the bottom of that because it is
45:25 - stuck onto there so that is my
45:28 - section title
45:29 - my subtitle
45:30 - they're both going to need the spacing
45:32 - so i think we can add our margin bottom
45:34 - here of 1m
45:36 - just to give us that nice little space
45:39 - and at small screen sizes
45:40 - i don't mind that too much this does
45:42 - need a box shadow we're going to come
45:43 - and do that afterward though
45:45 - and where we do need this to change is
45:47 - once we get into our media queries here
45:49 - and when we start changing this
45:51 - for the larger screen sizes
45:53 - i know i set the fonts to change at 800.
45:55 - i'm going to set this to change its 600
45:57 - though
45:59 - my stance on when media queries should
46:01 - come in
46:02 - 600
46:03 - as again this is a bit of a generic
46:05 - thing your text might change your images
46:07 - might change you're going to play around
46:08 - with it a little bit um so i'm doing 600
46:10 - is a bit of a generic one i like
46:12 - designing from you know 300 and up 600
46:15 - and up and 900 and up tend to be some
46:17 - nice generic uh ones instead of focusing
46:20 - on specific devices but your mileage may
46:24 - vary with all of that um so the first
46:26 - thing i'm going to do is actually we're
46:28 - going to define a display
46:30 - of grid on here and we're going to set
46:32 - up a grid
46:34 - i do like using
46:36 - let's say grid
46:38 - template
46:41 - areas um i do like i love my grid
46:44 - template areas so in my grid template
46:46 - areas here i am going to go on another
46:47 - line just because i find it makes it a
46:49 - little bit easier and we're going to say
46:50 - title
46:52 - and then on the next one we're going to
46:53 - do an image and subtitle like that
46:58 - and then we can say my grid
47:01 - template
47:03 - columns
47:04 - will be
47:06 - i'm going to do a min content so it's
47:08 - going to try and shrink that down as
47:10 - small as it can we're going to set our
47:12 - image up so hopefully that doesn't
47:13 - actually disappear
47:15 - because that is for my image and then my
47:17 - text will be set to max content to try
47:19 - and make that as big as possible
47:21 - now obviously we need to get things
47:23 - actually lining up where we want them to
47:25 - be because that's going to cause a
47:26 - little bit of an issue
47:28 - so let's start off with my
47:30 - intro
47:31 - image
47:35 - which i didn't actually put a class on
47:37 - so here we can do class is equal to
47:39 - intro image
47:41 - that will help
47:43 - [Music]
47:44 - sorry about that so
47:46 - uh our intro image will be our grid area
47:49 - of img
47:50 - and as i was a little worried about that
47:52 - means my image is actually going to
47:53 - disappear so let's fix that um we're
47:56 - gonna actually say this has a min width
47:59 - of 250 pixels just so it never
48:01 - disappears and that's much better but
48:03 - now my text is stuck to the side there
48:05 - which is no good so here we can do a
48:07 - grid column
48:09 - gap of 1m just to create that spacing
48:12 - that we want
48:13 - and
48:14 - the subtitle we might not actually be
48:15 - able to use but we're going to leave it
48:17 - there anyway
48:19 - so that is
48:20 - nice uh the only problem is we we don't
48:22 - want to be stuck there we want it to
48:24 - stick in the middle so i am also going
48:25 - to do
48:26 - a width
48:28 - of min content which should shrink it
48:30 - down and then give it a margin of zero
48:33 - auto and so it should match the width of
48:36 - the
48:37 - whole div well or the section will match
48:39 - the content that's inside of it and the
48:40 - zero auto will keep it nice and centered
48:42 - when we're at these bigger screen sizes
48:44 - so we can see that it is working nicely
48:46 - but the front end dev we have a bit of a
48:48 - problem where it is stretching there
48:51 - so that was my section
48:55 - subtitle
48:56 - intro now this is where things get a
48:58 - little dicey because should this be here
49:00 - or should it be up in the typography
49:01 - section i'm going to argue that it
49:03 - should be here because we're pertaining
49:04 - to layout right now or not pertaining to
49:06 - the type if you think it makes more
49:08 - sense to leave it all in one spot
49:09 - together i completely agree with you and
49:11 - you can go ahead and do that because
49:13 - we're only worrying about layout right
49:15 - now i'm keeping this part of this stuff
49:17 - down here where the rest of my intro
49:19 - layout content is
49:22 - so for this i'm going to start by doing
49:24 - an align self as start which will stop
49:27 - it from stretching down and it sort of
49:29 - fits into that area a little bit nicer
49:31 - and i'm also now going to say that my
49:34 - grid
49:35 - column
49:37 - is negative 1 over 1 which will have it
49:40 - stretch the whole length and going all
49:42 - the way across which is great except now
49:45 - it's going underneath this because by
49:46 - default they don't want to overlap
49:48 - so to get around that overlapping issue
49:51 - we can are not the lack of wanting to
49:53 - overlap i should say
49:55 - we can do a grid row of two
49:58 - because we have our grid row of one uh
50:01 - our grid row one line and then our two
50:03 - so it's there now our text is there we
50:05 - want it on this side so we can also do a
50:08 - simple text align to the right i notice
50:10 - that we're pertaining to layout more but
50:12 - at least there we go it is starting to
50:14 - work um and starting to come together
50:17 - now my original plan to get this to go
50:21 - underneath like that was actually to use
50:24 - um absolute positioning because absolute
50:26 - positioning the grid work fantastically
50:27 - together but i think we can actually
50:29 - pull this off with relative positioning
50:32 - um and of having to avoid absolute
50:34 - positioning sometimes is a good idea so
50:37 - what i'm thinking is on here we can do a
50:39 - position of relative but my left is
50:43 - going to be negative 2m
50:44 - and if we go take a look see let's pull
50:46 - this over so that's giving us that space
50:49 - here maybe that's a little bit too much
50:50 - so maybe we can do like a negative
50:52 - 1.5 um
50:55 - and i think that'd be probably a little
50:57 - bit closer perfect
50:58 - uh the only problem now is the width
51:00 - won't match and this is where if you did
51:01 - use absolute positioning you can say
51:03 - left
51:04 - negative 1.5 and you can say right and 0
51:06 - and it's going to line up perfectly
51:08 - we can't actually do that when we're
51:10 - using um
51:12 - relative positioning
51:14 - but we can do a little cheat and i love
51:15 - doing things let's not cheat it's uh
51:17 - what these types of things are made for
51:19 - so my width is going to be a calc of 100
51:23 - plus
51:25 - 1.5 m
51:26 - um and that should make the width be 100
51:31 - plus 1.5 m and then it lines everything
51:33 - up nice and perfectly so i think that's
51:35 - really cool and fun
51:37 - i love doing stuff like that
51:40 - um so that's working i think it's pretty
51:42 - straightforward too by having these
51:43 - together and usually i have width near
51:45 - the top but i do think it means like
51:46 - keeping these together means the makes
51:48 - them work better and i am going to
51:50 - increase the padding a little bit but i
51:51 - think we're going to want to do this on
51:53 - both of them so let's just come all the
51:55 - way up here we set a background on that
51:57 - so i think i'm going to set my padding
51:58 - here
51:59 - um padding of say 0.25
52:02 - [Music]
52:03 - one m let's just see what that ends up
52:05 - looking like
52:07 - yeah perfect so i like that now um it's
52:10 - not lining up like my design where i
52:12 - matched that but obviously if the title
52:14 - changed i did front end dev but say you
52:15 - wanted a different title that could
52:17 - actually break it a little bit where
52:18 - it's actually going to go underneath the
52:19 - image
52:20 - a tad so i think instead of changing
52:23 - that if you wanted to play with the font
52:25 - size you could very easily play with it
52:27 - but i'm going to keep it as this smaller
52:28 - font size because it's going to give
52:30 - people more room if they had a longer
52:31 - title without breaking it
52:33 - i think that where the media queries
52:35 - here are would prevent someone unless
52:37 - you get a really long title from this
52:39 - becoming an issue so the last thing for
52:41 - now is we're going to stick it
52:42 - underneath and add that box shadow onto
52:44 - there so let's go and take a look at how
52:46 - we can do that uh putting it underneath
52:48 - is going to be easy enough
52:50 - i'm actually just going to come on the
52:51 - image and give this a position of
52:53 - relative and
52:54 - uh that should be enough but we can also
52:57 - just to be safe give it a z index of two
52:59 - just so we know that it's coming up on
53:01 - top
53:02 - and now for the box shadow i like doing
53:04 - complicated box shadows because they can
53:06 - be a little bit nicer looking
53:08 - so what i'm actually going to do because
53:10 - we do want to use it in more than one
53:11 - place
53:12 - i'm going to come up to
53:14 - my custom properties here and create my
53:16 - box shadow here so i'm just going to
53:18 - call it bs which could be a number of
53:19 - things but it will be box shadow um and
53:22 - we're going to do one it's going to be a
53:23 - small offset so 0.25 m 0.25 m so that's
53:27 - to the right and down just a little bit
53:30 - the blur will be a 0.75 m
53:33 - and we'll give it an rgba of 000.25
53:38 - except that should be our gb and that
53:42 - should be good so now we can come down
53:43 - and put it on our image but we don't
53:46 - want to put it on this one we want to
53:48 - put it on our image at all sizes so i'm
53:50 - going to do my
53:52 - intro image out here
53:54 - and give it a box shadow of var
53:58 - bs
54:00 - and that should start by giving us a
54:02 - nice subtle shadow i think just like
54:03 - that it looks good um but i like always
54:06 - coming in and adding a little bit to my
54:08 - shadows so i'm going to do a comma and
54:11 - then i'm going to break this onto a
54:12 - second line but if you don't want to you
54:14 - don't have to
54:15 - i can continue right after
54:18 - the shadows layer on it so if you're
54:19 - doing more than one shadow you can
54:21 - always start with the bigger
54:23 - one first and then like smaller ones
54:25 - after because it's coming sort of closer
54:26 - to us if that makes sense uh the blur
54:29 - will be smaller as well and rgba
54:32 - of 000.15
54:36 - and don't forget your m here uh so the
54:38 - difference between the two of them will
54:39 - be very subtle but it just gives you a
54:41 - bit of a darker shadow that's a little
54:43 - bit closer it's layering things and then
54:45 - the next one's a little bit lighter so
54:46 - it can be a little bit more realistic if
54:48 - you look at things like material design
54:49 - they often have two three shadows deep
54:52 - just to help increase the realism of
54:54 - their shadows so there we go i think
54:56 - that's looking really really cool
54:58 - it never gets too big too wide but
55:00 - that's all right and then
55:02 - you know as we go so it's a nice little
55:04 - focus point it shrinks down and then it
55:06 - shrinks once again and this bar going
55:08 - all the way across like that to me works
55:10 - well at the small screen sizes
55:12 - but if that's bugging you and you really
55:14 - don't want it to do that we could come
55:16 - in
55:17 - at our small screen sizes if this was
55:19 - just a display
55:21 - inline block
55:23 - because then what that's going to do is
55:24 - it's going to set the width to be the
55:26 - size of itself so then here we can see
55:28 - it's fitting exactly itself and then at
55:30 - the big screen sizes it will jump back
55:32 - to what we had so you know what i think
55:34 - for the small screen sizes i'm going to
55:35 - leave it like that but if you rather
55:37 - adjust that to something a little bit
55:38 - different by all means you know if you
55:40 - rather that bigger bar that matches the
55:41 - image size that is perfectly fine too
55:44 - that is it for this one in the next
55:46 - video we will jump down into this next
55:48 - what i do section and style that one up
55:50 - it should not be too much work and then
55:51 - we can keep on going we'll style our
55:53 - button at the same time
55:55 - since we haven't done that yet
55:59 - all right here we go with the services
56:01 - or what i do section
56:03 - which isn't too complicated to do if we
56:05 - go and look at it right now um it's not
56:07 - going to be all in place yet but we can
56:09 - see that our text is sort of coming
56:11 - there and when we get to the bigger
56:12 - screen sizes we just need to break
56:13 - across on all three so let's start by
56:16 - setting the colors up first so my
56:18 - services
56:20 - i'm going to give this a background
56:22 - color
56:23 - of we'll do our var color dark
56:27 - and a color of our color light
56:32 - to start things off i know we have a
56:34 - background image on this as well
56:36 - i always set a background color and then
56:38 - a background image afterwards because if
56:40 - the background image ever fails for one
56:42 - reason or another
56:43 - it's always good to be able to get them
56:46 - so we want to go back a step go to our
56:48 - images and then it was called services
56:50 - bg.jpg
56:53 - and we can see there we go it is coming
56:55 - in
56:56 - with that going to do a background size
56:59 - of cover to make sure that it never
57:01 - repeats itself and i think that should
57:03 - be pretty good actually um we can see
57:05 - that it is coming in nicely just like
57:07 - that it is a little bit uh bright and so
57:10 - if you ever you know you want to we
57:12 - could always do a background blend mode
57:14 - on here too of multiply
57:16 - uh
57:17 - just to help darken the whole thing up
57:19 - we're sort of losing the image maybe
57:21 - more than we want so we could play with
57:22 - the background color or the image i'm
57:24 - actually going to leave it like this
57:25 - because to me it's more important that
57:27 - the text is super readable even if it
57:29 - means the background's a bit darker than
57:30 - what you intended it to be um whereas
57:33 - here you can see it was like in that
57:34 - example that i had so it's up to you
57:36 - whether you want this multiply on or off
57:39 - uh you know you can play with the color
57:40 - this is where you could say instead of
57:42 - color dark we do color accent
57:44 - um and then you'd actually get like that
57:46 - green color that's coming through so it
57:48 - really depends on the layout that you're
57:49 - doing it could be a fun um a fun thing
57:52 - to play around with but i'm gonna i
57:54 - think leave it like this for now and
57:56 - again the reason we put both the color
57:58 - and the image is just in case the image
58:01 - doesn't load for some reason at least
58:02 - people will still be able to read the
58:03 - text
58:04 - um i also always do my background color
58:06 - and image and size if i need it as long
58:09 - hand instead of the shorthand property
58:10 - because the background shorthand drives
58:12 - me crazy i like short hands that save me
58:15 - time and i can put them in any order and
58:17 - the background one i tend to find breaks
58:19 - things
58:20 - more than anything else
58:21 - i'm also going to throw a text align
58:23 - center on this whole thing because
58:25 - everything on this on small and large
58:27 - screens is centered so that is great
58:31 - the section title services was a little
58:33 - bit unique um so i'm going to stay here
58:36 - for now section title
58:38 - services
58:40 - uh because the color of it is my var
58:43 - color
58:44 - accent
58:45 - we're going to need a bit more of a
58:47 - margin on it i think uh but before we do
58:50 - the margin i'm just going to give it a
58:51 - position of relative
58:55 - because i have the pseudo-element that i
58:57 - want to put on it so it's my let's just
58:59 - copy this because it's a little bit
59:01 - faster and my after
59:04 - so that's i'm going to use my suit
59:06 - element just to create this light line
59:08 - that's coming in right there
59:10 - so it's nice and easy to do we just have
59:12 - to do
59:13 - a content so if you don't know too much
59:15 - about custom about custom properties i
59:17 - was going to say about pseudoelements is
59:20 - you need to give them a content or they
59:21 - will not appear and either display block
59:24 - or position i'm going to say display
59:25 - block this time
59:27 - width of about 25
59:30 - a height of one pixel
59:32 - um margin of
59:35 - 0.5 m so it's going to give us some
59:38 - space on the top auto left and right and
59:40 - 1m on the bottom and this is why i
59:42 - didn't put any margins on my title
59:44 - itself because i think most of the
59:45 - spacing that i need i can have my suit
59:47 - element creating
59:49 - for me and of course we need a
59:50 - background on here um we could do two
59:53 - different things
59:54 - we'll do in my var
59:56 - color
59:57 - light though
59:58 - the other option you could have if you
60:00 - always wanted to match the title of the
60:02 - services is we could put that to current
60:05 - color
60:06 - so if it's current color it's going to
60:07 - match this color that we have on the
60:09 - text there
60:11 - i don't know if i like that 25
60:13 - we might set a set width on that instead
60:15 - of like 3m
60:18 - just to have a nice little set width so
60:19 - now it's green and green i prefer that
60:22 - actually if it's white so i'm going to
60:23 - switch that back
60:24 - but if you do current color whatever
60:26 - color you decide to put for this this
60:28 - will automatically match
60:29 - no matter what var
60:31 - color
60:33 - light i think is going to look a little
60:35 - bit nicer
60:36 - and we're going to lower the opacity on
60:38 - it to opacity of 0.5 just so it doesn't
60:41 - stand out as much it should be a little
60:42 - design element maybe even a 0.25 will be
60:45 - enough
60:46 - um it should be more of a design element
60:48 - than something that's really interface
60:49 - that we can really see
60:51 - so there we go i think that is good
60:53 - maybe it could be a little smaller but i
60:54 - think it looks nice
60:56 - how it is so i'm going to leave it just
60:58 - like that let's move it to two
61:00 - as i said that now went to the smaller
61:01 - screens it was a little bit too big so
61:04 - there we go so at the small screens it
61:05 - is done we still have to style our
61:07 - button but the layout for this part is
61:08 - completely done and if we go up to the
61:10 - bigger screens well that's where we need
61:12 - it to break into
61:14 - multiple columns so what i'm going to do
61:16 - is we're going to start with
61:18 - a media query we might have to come back
61:20 - up min width i'm going to do my 800
61:22 - pixels again
61:24 - and let's do my services
61:28 - gets a display
61:31 - oops this
61:32 - play
61:33 - flex on it so that should make three
61:35 - columns right away
61:37 - i'm also gonna give it a max width
61:38 - though max width of say a thousand
61:40 - pixels and a margin of zero auto the
61:43 - thousand pixel max width that i'm
61:45 - putting on that is a bit of a guess um
61:47 - at this stage but i think it's going to
61:48 - work nicely
61:50 - um where i can't even get to there based
61:52 - on my screen size right now but it's
61:53 - just going to stop things from oh it is
61:54 - we're getting there right around there
61:56 - which is pretty much perfect
61:58 - uh the only thing is we do need a little
62:00 - bit of space between our individual
62:03 - services
62:04 - so this is where we could say that if i
62:05 - have a service
62:07 - plus a service
62:10 - we can have a margin
62:12 - left i'm trying to think service plus a
62:14 - service margin
62:16 - yeah left was right of say 2m
62:20 - i'm also going to i'm wondering if they
62:22 - should have a width on them or not let's
62:23 - just set that like that and let's just
62:25 - go take a look there we go we have a bit
62:27 - of space between them now they're no
62:28 - longer touching uh if you don't know
62:30 - about this
62:31 - the plus combinator that i did it's
62:33 - saying it
62:35 - the sibling so it's going to look at
62:36 - this one and it's going to look at this
62:37 - one so it's ignoring this but it goes
62:39 - sort of the sibling so is there a
62:41 - sibling yes it's adding a margin on the
62:42 - left and then this one is the sibling so
62:44 - it's adding the margin to the left of
62:46 - that and then there's no more so it's
62:48 - not adding it to any other ones and this
62:49 - one is not getting a margin left so it
62:51 - doesn't create this giant space on the
62:54 - left side of that that we don't want to
62:55 - have
62:56 - so that is perfection and then it's sort
62:58 - of like adding a gap um when i you know
63:00 - with the grid we have gap flexbox gap is
63:02 - coming it's in firefox but it's not in
63:04 - the other ones yet so we're sort of
63:06 - stuck doing it like that
63:08 - so that's working well
63:09 - um i think on small screens this is
63:11 - working but then we get to these bigger
63:12 - screens like here
63:14 - the length of the text is a little bit
63:16 - too long so what i am going to do is
63:22 - here before we get to our media query
63:24 - i'm going to say the individual service
63:26 - also as a max
63:28 - width of we'll try 500
63:30 - and with that we'll need a margin
63:33 - of zero auto to keep it centered as well
63:36 - and if we go take a look now
63:39 - uh i think that's a little bit better
63:40 - it's just stopping it from getting too
63:42 - big and it shouldn't affect it at this
63:44 - size because they're never actually
63:45 - getting bigger than 500 pixels
63:47 - so there we go i think that's working
63:49 - nicely and then click it's working
63:51 - nicely there so i'm just going to worry
63:53 - about my button now
63:55 - and this is you do have the choice a
63:57 - little bit here i'm not i'm going to
63:58 - leave this here um
64:01 - because again it's mostly dealing with
64:02 - layout but i guess this one you could
64:04 - argue should be up with my typography
64:07 - i'm a little weird how i guess i work in
64:09 - that i'm wondering if i should group it
64:11 - all together but i am going to go all
64:13 - the way up to here
64:15 - for my
64:16 - dot btn um so usually for my buttons i
64:20 - usually have designs that have more than
64:22 - one button so i'm just very buttons
64:24 - but in this case i only had the one
64:26 - button
64:27 - to style up so all my styles are going
64:29 - on here an inline
64:31 - block
64:32 - padding can be 0.5 m 1.5 m which sort of
64:36 - gives it its size the background will be
64:39 - my var
64:40 - color accent
64:42 - the color itself so the text color can
64:44 - be color
64:46 - uh dark
64:47 - uh text decoration since it can be set
64:50 - on a link will be none
64:51 - i'm also going to do cursor pointer this
64:54 - is in case you ever do put it on a
64:56 - button instead of putting it on a link
64:58 - that's important to have
65:00 - font size i'm going to shrink it down a
65:02 - little bit because i think it was a bit
65:03 - too big i don't have a custom property
65:05 - for that we're just going to shrink it
65:06 - here we can do a text transform
65:09 - upper case so it's always capitalized
65:12 - and if you ever do all cap text it can
65:15 - help
65:16 - letter
65:18 - spacing to do letter spacing on
65:20 - something to help spread them out a
65:22 - little bit uh we're
65:23 - speaking of typography font weight i
65:25 - think i use my var font weight bold on
65:28 - this
65:29 - and then we can also look at my
65:31 - transition i'm going to do a transition
65:34 - on my transforms
65:37 - 200 milliseconds ease
65:39 - in out and the reason oops in
65:43 - ease in out uh the reason that i'm
65:45 - putting that on there is because on my
65:48 - etn hover i want to put a transform of
65:52 - scale
65:53 - 1.1
65:55 - so when we do hover on my button it will
65:57 - get bigger and smaller
66:00 - the only thing is my
66:02 - transition
66:06 - transform not transform
66:09 - and there we go now
66:12 - uh there we go now we can have a nice
66:13 - little transition when we hover on top
66:15 - of it
66:16 - but there is another thing i want to do
66:18 - um and i'm actually going to do this on
66:19 - all my links and on everything really so
66:23 - where should we put it uh we'll do it
66:25 - right here before my buttons i'm going
66:26 - to say everything when it has a focus
66:28 - state is going to get an outline on it
66:32 - outline
66:34 - will become
66:35 - let's say three pixels
66:37 - solid var
66:39 - color accent
66:41 - so this is going to apply to my button
66:42 - but it's also going to apply to other
66:44 - things now the only problem with it is
66:46 - it doesn't really jump out at you when
66:47 - you tab onto that right so you can see
66:49 - if i'm here and i tab it gets a little
66:51 - bit bigger
66:52 - so to really make sure people can notice
66:54 - it i'm also going to do an outline
66:56 - offset
66:57 - of say 3 pixels
67:00 - so if i'm here and i tab it highlights
67:02 - that i am tabbed on it
67:04 - so it's not a hover state it's really
67:06 - just for my focus state which is a
67:08 - little bit different
67:09 - um grabs the attention a little bit more
67:11 - than my hover might do
67:13 - so
67:14 - that is what i'm going to do for all my
67:16 - focus this will be on my links will be
67:17 - on other things we're going to leave it
67:18 - just like that because i'll talk more
67:20 - about it once we start getting to our
67:21 - links and a few other things i'm going
67:23 - to come down one last detail though what
67:26 - i don't like now is how close everything
67:28 - is like how close my button is to
67:30 - everything else there i could add a
67:32 - margin top to my button but i do want to
67:34 - think that maybe this would be something
67:35 - that would be working in like the real
67:37 - world or on other things and actually
67:39 - here i think i wrote see my work we're
67:41 - gonna change my button a little bit
67:44 - um i did 1.5 let's make this like 2.5
67:48 - because my button was quite a bit
67:50 - wider
67:52 - so i think that'll work better for my
67:53 - padding
67:54 - and i'm going to come to my section
67:58 - how's it looking at the small screen
67:59 - it's probably the same problem
68:01 - it's a little bit where it's a little
68:02 - bit it's way too tight
68:04 - so on my
68:05 - dot services
68:07 - plural margin bottom of 2m
68:12 - actually i'm going to bring that up to
68:13 - like 4m
68:15 - because i had quite a bit of space it
68:17 - balances out between this space in this
68:19 - space i think that looks a lot better
68:21 - and so it's looking a lot better the
68:23 - only problem is my margin is
68:24 - disappearing here because over here i
68:27 - did a margin zero auto so i'm gonna have
68:29 - to change that to be a margin
68:30 - left of auto and a margin right of auto
68:34 - just so it doesn't overwrite that margin
68:36 - bottom
68:37 - along the way
68:39 - and so it's always sitting at that same
68:41 - spacing super duper that section is all
68:44 - done i'm super happy with it and so now
68:46 - we can move on to this next section
68:52 - okay so we're going to be doing the who
68:54 - i am or the about me section in this
68:56 - video and we're going to be using grid
68:57 - once again for it a little bit like we
68:59 - did up above to be a super similar grid
69:01 - but we're flipping it around a little
69:02 - bit because if you remember uh when we
69:04 - did that the image is on the left side
69:06 - and is smaller and then um this area
69:08 - will be quite a bit wider
69:10 - than the other one and obviously the
69:12 - image is on the other side but that
69:13 - doesn't change things up too much um so
69:16 - let's start off just with me about me i
69:20 - think what we're going to do for now is
69:21 - just give it a max width of 1000 pixels
69:24 - like we did on this section above we'll
69:26 - give it a margin of zero auto to keep it
69:28 - that centered and let's go take a look
69:30 - to see if that's had any impact on
69:32 - things so the small screen sizes we
69:35 - should be okay and then when we get to
69:37 - the larger one at one point it does max
69:39 - out on the size so the line length is
69:41 - quite long now but since we're going to
69:42 - be making that into two columns i think
69:44 - it will look perfection
69:46 - um so let's take a look it's right
69:48 - around here now it depends on the size
69:50 - of the image we use obviously on how
69:52 - that's going to work out um but we want
69:54 - to build in our media query i think
69:56 - we'll do the same that we did previously
69:58 - so add media
70:00 - or i just realized i did um 800 pixels
70:02 - for the services i'm gonna go with a 600
70:04 - again for here so 600 pixels i'd said in
70:07 - another video um that i usually do like
70:09 - a six nine um in this case the 800 just
70:12 - seemed to work better uh as a break
70:15 - point for when this would switch over
70:17 - than 900
70:18 - if you prefer things all switching at
70:20 - similar levels you could definitely
70:21 - bring that up to a nine i just find it
70:24 - um we're sort of wasting screen space um
70:26 - you know we can go to three columns
70:28 - around the 800 pixel point
70:30 - some people like having really set media
70:33 - queries i don't use a lot of media
70:34 - queries i sort of do one per section
70:36 - maybe two per second so you can also
70:38 - deal with really big screens sometimes
70:39 - you need to make some changes
70:42 - but i like having media queries
70:45 - that deal with my layout more than i
70:47 - have media queries that just fill in
70:49 - with the set sizes i think it makes a
70:51 - lot more sense and i think this one's um
70:53 - you know once we get to about the 600
70:55 - pixels we can break that off into the
70:56 - two columns and it will work really
70:58 - really well all right so in this media
71:00 - query i'm going to set um my
71:03 - about me
71:05 - and we're going to set up a display grid
71:07 - on here
71:08 - and my grid
71:09 - template
71:11 - columns and micro template columns we're
71:13 - going to do a 1 fr for the main area and
71:15 - then for my image itself i think for the
71:17 - moment i'm going to lock it in at like
71:18 - 200 pixels maybe we'll play around with
71:20 - that number a little bit but 200 um i
71:22 - think will match pretty well with the
71:24 - design that we have um it's gonna let
71:26 - the image be bigger than that at
71:27 - different screen sizes it could be a
71:29 - number that you change for your own
71:30 - layout depending on the image that you
71:31 - want to use and i am using pixels here
71:33 - and i am actually using pixels in my
71:35 - media queries as well as you might have
71:36 - noticed you might be wondering about
71:37 - that some people try to avoid pixels
71:40 - i do avoid them in my font sizes as
71:42 - you've seen i use my rams
71:44 - i use rams for font sizes because it is
71:46 - if a user has set a custom font size for
71:49 - their browser because they want things
71:50 - to be bigger it does allow that to work
71:52 - things zoom in and out nicely
71:55 - but there's nothing wrong with using say
71:56 - a pixel value on a max width it's not
71:58 - going to cause any issues we're going to
72:00 - need a gap on that but let's set things
72:02 - up a little bit now on the last one i
72:04 - did use my grid template areas but let's
72:06 - go
72:07 - let's take a look quickly here and how
72:09 - we set it up so we have
72:12 - about me
72:14 - um i didn't once again i didn't give my
72:16 - image a class which was what i was
72:18 - thinking i'm going to do about me
72:21 - image
72:22 - because we do want to start by placing
72:24 - that one where we want about me
72:26 - image
72:28 - and that one i'm going to give a grid
72:31 - row last time i did it with
72:33 - grid template areas this time i'm going
72:34 - to say i'm going to say 1 over negative
72:36 - 1 which means it's starting at the top
72:38 - and ending at the last row automatically
72:40 - and my grid column
72:42 - will start at grid at column line 2.
72:46 - so that should fix
72:48 - that up we also want my
72:51 - uh we want the section
72:53 - title
72:55 - about
72:56 - uh is going to be a grid
72:58 - column
72:59 - of one
73:02 - and actually we can do that for my uh oh
73:04 - that was my subtitle we can do the same
73:07 - thing for our
73:08 - section
73:10 - title
73:11 - so we have both of those let's hit save
73:13 - i just have a little typo down here
73:15 - let's change that to be um semicolon and
73:18 - go and check it out title is okay
73:20 - let's see this is where grid areas
73:22 - sometimes make things easier and why i
73:23 - like to use them in general
73:25 - once again even though we're not going
73:27 - to be able to use a grid area for this
73:29 - one since it's overlapping
73:31 - it could overall be a little bit easier
73:32 - than using line numbers um it also makes
73:34 - it easier as a template for people to
73:36 - change things around so why don't we set
73:38 - that up
73:39 - with some grid
73:41 - temp
73:42 - grid template
73:43 - areas
73:44 - so we can have our title and the image
73:47 - next to it
73:48 - and i like putting these all in the next
73:49 - line and indenting it just because it
73:51 - makes it easier to overlap each one
73:53 - uh the next would be my subtitle and my
73:55 - image
73:57 - and the last one would be my text and my
73:59 - image i'm going to go back on this
74:01 - actually and we can say that this is my
74:03 - grid
74:04 - area title
74:07 - the image will be
74:08 - grid area
74:11 - image and it really does make it a lot
74:13 - easier to manipulate this if you wanted
74:15 - to change your grid just by changing how
74:16 - the grid template areas are set up and
74:19 - we can already see that it's much
74:21 - falling pretty much in line with what we
74:23 - want it to be doing
74:24 - which is awesome and at the small screen
74:26 - sizes it's working out nicely and then
74:28 - we boop we get to the larger screen it
74:30 - breaks into the two columns
74:32 - a little bit more work to be done still
74:34 - on this but i'm going to also add in
74:35 - here a grid gap a grid column gap i
74:38 - don't want to create any gaps on
74:41 - my
74:42 - rows so my grid column gap
74:44 - i'll go with like a 2m maybe this time
74:46 - 1m could work nicely but i like keeping
74:48 - a bit of space on there so that looks
74:50 - good on my image i'm also going to add
74:53 - we can come actually up to here about
74:57 - me
74:58 - image
74:59 - you can add our box shadow box shadow
75:02 - bar this is where it becomes nice the
75:05 - first time you set up a custom property
75:06 - it can seem like a waste of time but as
75:08 - soon as you reuse it it is super handy
75:11 - so there we go
75:12 - um my
75:15 - section
75:17 - subtitle about we're going to want to
75:19 - give that a graded column of 1 over
75:22 - negative 1 so it goes from one side all
75:24 - the way over to the other side
75:26 - and
75:28 - grid
75:29 - row of two to keep it in the right place
75:33 - so there we go now it is going
75:34 - underneath my image right there so this
75:36 - one's going to take a little bit more
75:38 - playing around with in how we're going
75:39 - to set it up to make sure that text
75:41 - doesn't go underneath the image like it
75:42 - is doing now
75:44 - uh it's not terribly complicated and if
75:46 - you do have an issue up top with how
75:48 - that's working you could always use the
75:49 - same method up there to fix it
75:53 - so what we're going to do
75:54 - first let's give it a position
75:57 - of relative and we can do this very
76:00 - similar to what we did last time i'm
76:01 - going to give it a left of negative 2 m
76:06 - and i'm going to give it a width of calc
76:09 - 100
76:12 - in this case i'm actually into a plus 4
76:14 - m
76:16 - and
76:17 - that's the reason i'm doing it like this
76:19 - is because i do want it to stick out
76:20 - both sides a little bit and maybe that's
76:22 - going to be a bit too much
76:24 - it works here but it's going to cause
76:25 - some issues there
76:26 - but we do want it to stick out both
76:28 - sides
76:30 - um so by doing it this way it's going to
76:32 - stick out both sides which is cool but
76:34 - we will have to build in the padding to
76:35 - fix that so padding
76:36 - can be i'm just trying to think 2m for
76:39 - both sides so padding left of 2m
76:43 - but then the padding right actually
76:44 - padding left will be 2m the padding
76:46 - right
76:47 - i'm going to do
76:49 - calc
76:50 - of 200 pixels
76:52 - plus
76:54 - 2m
76:56 - and what that's going to
76:58 - do is make it so my text we have this is
77:01 - all padding on this side now so the text
77:04 - will never touch the image you can see
77:06 - it's getting really close but it's not
77:08 - clicking now we have the 2m there i'm
77:10 - actually going to boost this up to 4m
77:13 - and what that's doing so now when we
77:16 - look at it um what it's doing is it's
77:18 - setting it up so the text can never go
77:20 - into the image so on this side we have
77:21 - our 2m then we have the 200 pixels and
77:24 - then i had a grid gap of 2m so i'm
77:26 - pretty much in the 4 is the inclusion of
77:29 - both of those
77:30 - so the text will never once we set it up
77:32 - we'll never go underneath that image so
77:34 - that can come in handy if you go to a
77:37 - smaller screen size and we get this
77:38 - where it's breaking over on two lines or
77:40 - if you have a long title you had a short
77:42 - title it's not going to change anything
77:44 - in the long run
77:45 - my only issue is that this isn't really
77:47 - working right now with
77:49 - how we've set things up so what i'm
77:51 - actually going to do for now is my
77:52 - padding left
77:54 - my left will be negative one
77:57 - this is going to be plus 2
77:59 - and
78:01 - this is going to go back down to 1. i
78:03 - think we can leave that one
78:05 - if we really wanted to we could
78:09 - change that number to a 3 but i think
78:11 - i'll leave it as a for it because i
78:12 - don't think it's going to get in the way
78:13 - and that's just going to make sure it is
78:14 - sticking out but the reason i put the
78:15 - padding on that side is just so all the
78:16 - text is actually lining up if you don't
78:18 - like that and you don't like the fact
78:19 - that it's sticking off obviously you can
78:21 - play around with that number a little
78:22 - bit
78:23 - but at least now it's working better at
78:25 - the other sizes with the 1m
78:28 - instead of the 2m
78:29 - because we have 2m of padding it gives
78:31 - it room that it can still live inside
78:33 - without
78:34 - causing any overflow and then obviously
78:36 - at the small screens we don't have
78:37 - anything to worry about
78:39 - so that is looking pretty good but what
78:41 - i want to do is one last thing um
78:44 - we do want to reposition it on top of my
78:46 - image i'm just going to come here onto
78:48 - my image and give this a position
78:51 - relative which should fix the issue but
78:53 - once again i'll give it a z index of two
78:55 - just to make sure that it's always on
78:57 - top and there we go so it should be
79:00 - working out great um the thing that's
79:01 - nice about this is because of the way
79:03 - the image is going to be calculated like
79:05 - if we had longer text here it's just
79:06 - going to keep flowing down it's not
79:07 - going to actually break anything it's
79:08 - not going to cause any issues but if you
79:10 - had really short text it's also going to
79:12 - work and shouldn't have any issues and
79:13 - that's one of the reasons why i included
79:15 - this inside one div
79:17 - if you remember when we set it up we did
79:19 - that as
79:20 - an about me body
79:22 - and it's important that it's in this
79:23 - body because it's only going to create
79:25 - one row where so if any additional
79:27 - content needs to go inside this body if
79:29 - you include extra paragraphs that are
79:31 - outside of that it's going to keep
79:32 - creating new rows in the grid and it
79:34 - could actually impact the way that the
79:35 - image is working i don't know if it
79:37 - would actually break anything
79:38 - but pretty much all the content itself
79:40 - will have to go inside of that body area
79:43 - just to ensure that it's one row so
79:45 - nothing breaks along the way and that is
79:47 - that area all wrapped up so in the next
79:49 - video we will move on to the next one
79:54 - so we're going to be doing the portfolio
79:56 - section we're going to be using grid for
79:57 - this one as well and one nice thing with
79:59 - it is in this example image i only have
80:02 - six pieces in the code i have i have 10
80:04 - and it's one that should be flexible and
80:06 - be able to grow or shrink
80:08 - depending on the screen size and we
80:10 - shouldn't need any media queries for
80:12 - this one this is one of my favorite
80:13 - functions of grid
80:15 - so if we just look really fast on our
80:16 - markup before we start doing anything
80:19 - and we look at how we did this i have
80:21 - the we have the basic my work area and
80:24 - then we have the portfolio itself and in
80:26 - each portfolio we have a portfolio item
80:27 - and a portfolio image
80:29 - so if i come back to here and let's
80:31 - create a new section
80:33 - uh so that was my
80:35 - work
80:36 - we do want to give this the background
80:40 - color
80:41 - of
80:42 - var
80:43 - color dark
80:46 - i will just say color is var
80:50 - color light
80:52 - even though the title will have to
80:54 - change colors
80:56 - i did forget to put this so a selection
80:59 - of my range of work sorry about that so
81:02 - there we go it is there
81:04 - we can also just throw to make our life
81:06 - as easy as possible we can throw a
81:09 - text align center on here as well
81:11 - because that's the only text that we
81:13 - will have now obviously the colors
81:15 - aren't quite matching and this one
81:16 - should be bold uh on the bottom so i
81:18 - think what i didn't do
81:20 - was give these their own classes
81:23 - and just by doing that i can say that my
81:25 - i don't really need the the first one
81:26 - but my section
81:28 - subtitle
81:30 - work
81:31 - color can be my var
81:33 - color accent
81:35 - and my font weight can be var
81:39 - font weight
81:40 - bold now these are really just
81:43 - typography there's nothing but layout
81:44 - really on these i will add a margin
81:46 - bottom to it margin bottom of 1m
81:48 - um just to help with the spacing a
81:50 - little bit maybe we can bring that up to
81:51 - 2 actually
81:53 - this one if you wanted to argue because
81:55 - it's all typography and it has nothing
81:57 - to do with layout purposes it could come
81:59 - up and live with all of this stuff here
82:02 - and so just like i did with these ones i
82:05 - think i'll leave that one right there um
82:07 - for my
82:09 - portfolio now portfolio we're going to
82:11 - do a display of grid on here
82:14 - we're going to do a grid
82:16 - template
82:18 - columns
82:19 - and this is where the fun starts on my
82:21 - grid template columns what we're going
82:22 - to do is a
82:24 - repeat so if you don't know repeats say
82:26 - we do 3 comma 1 fr it's automatically
82:29 - going to make three columns so if we go
82:31 - and look we have three columns there and
82:33 - it's working out really nicely and if i
82:35 - bring that up to a 4 it's automatically
82:38 - going to make four columns and right
82:40 - away that makes for something that's
82:41 - really easily interchangeable which is
82:43 - really really cool but what's even
82:45 - better here is auto fit in a case like
82:47 - this
82:48 - but the thing with autofit is you can't
82:50 - just use something like 1fr you have to
82:52 - use a min max
82:54 - which sets a minimum and maximum value
82:57 - the minimum is really up to you i'm
82:58 - going to say it's about 300 pixels
83:02 - and a maximum of 1fr so it'll grow to
83:05 - the size that it needs to so it means
83:07 - each grid has a minimum size of 300
83:10 - pixels but if we if it has room to get
83:12 - bigger it will
83:14 - so let's go take a look and see what
83:15 - this does so it means at larger screens
83:17 - it works but when we get to smaller
83:19 - sizes oh it's automatically gone down to
83:21 - two
83:22 - and then at even smaller sizes it will
83:24 - automatically drop down to one and if
83:27 - you had very big screen sizes it would
83:29 - just keep growing and growing and
83:30 - growing so there is a chance you might
83:32 - also want to set a max width on this
83:36 - but it really depends on you i'm going
83:37 - to leave this off
83:39 - but if you wanted to have a maximum
83:40 - width just to prevent it from being this
83:42 - one long string that goes all the way
83:43 - across it is a choice if you set a max
83:45 - width also just give it a margin of zero
83:47 - auto to keep it centered on the screen
83:50 - but i think it's going to work perfectly
83:52 - like this it does mean because i have 10
83:54 - items that the one downside is sometimes
83:56 - you will end up with like one item
83:57 - that's left over at the end
83:59 - whereas you know now it's working really
84:01 - well with nine items but if i made it
84:02 - nine and then it goes down to the two
84:04 - column layout well then you're you know
84:06 - you'd have one empty one here so it
84:08 - really depends on the setup and how you
84:10 - wanna do all of that but overall um very
84:13 - simple nice and easy to do and it very
84:16 - very flexible
84:18 - depending you know you could have 100
84:19 - pieces in there you could have five
84:20 - pieces in there it's always going to
84:22 - work so that should work out nicely
84:24 - all right so now what we want to do is
84:26 - add a little bit of a hover effect so
84:28 - the first thing i'm actually going to do
84:30 - is take my portfolio
84:32 - item
84:34 - and on my portfolio item we're going to
84:35 - give it a background of our
84:38 - accent you might be going what's the
84:39 - point of that we're not going to see it
84:40 - you're right you will not see them my
84:42 - portfolio items obviously have an image
84:44 - on top so we will not see that color but
84:47 - we're going to play around with that a
84:48 - little bit now
84:49 - so what we're going to say is that my
84:52 - portfolio
84:54 - image we're going to set a transition on
84:56 - this so transition
84:58 - uh we're gonna transition two things a
85:00 - transform
85:01 - uh we're gonna do this one kind of
85:03 - slowly so we'll do 750 milliseconds
85:05 - which is pretty slow for me and we'll do
85:07 - a cubic
85:08 - bezier because we're going to be fancy
85:10 - here and a really nice one to start with
85:13 - is a 0.5
85:14 - but not 0.5 8.5 comma 0 comma
85:19 - 0.5 comma 1. it's a really nice curve
85:22 - very similar to an ease in out
85:25 - but a little bit
85:26 - more subtle so that will be for my
85:28 - transforms and then i'm going to do a
85:31 - actually we can put each one of these on
85:32 - a line because we're going to have two
85:34 - different ones uh so after this one
85:36 - we're going to put a comma and we're
85:37 - also going to transform the opacity of
85:39 - it this one will be a little bit faster
85:42 - so the opacity will transform over 250
85:45 - milliseconds and this one will just be a
85:47 - linear transition
85:49 - and so with that done i'm just going to
85:52 - copy my portfolio image
85:54 - and we can come down
85:56 - into here
85:58 - and my portfolio image hover
86:01 - we want to give this a transform
86:03 - on the scale uh we'll go up to like 1.2
86:06 - we're going to come back and forth a
86:07 - little bit uh once you've set this up
86:08 - we'll change the opacity to like a point
86:10 - seven five
86:12 - and i'm also
86:15 - and so let's go and take a look at what
86:17 - that's going to do so now we can see
86:19 - that when i hover on top the green color
86:21 - is going to show through and it's going
86:23 - to grow and shrink but obviously that
86:25 - looks kind of weird right that it's
86:26 - expanding like that we don't really want
86:28 - it to do that because that looks super
86:29 - awkward so on my portfolio item i'm also
86:32 - going to do an overflow of
86:34 - hidden
86:36 - so now if we go take a look when it
86:38 - grows it's just growing within that box
86:40 - and it won't overflow out so i think
86:42 - that makes a lot more sense and works
86:44 - much much better and we get that little
86:45 - color coming through on each one you
86:47 - could play with the opacity a little bit
86:49 - if you wanted it to more of the green to
86:51 - come through
86:52 - we could definitely have more of the
86:53 - green come through
86:55 - and because these are links we will be
86:57 - able to tab onto them but you can see it
86:58 - is doing that outline that i wanted it
87:01 - to have so if we want the tabbing to
87:04 - have a similar type of effect we can't
87:06 - actually focus on the image itself we
87:08 - can only focus on the link and then have
87:10 - the image inside of it and be modified
87:13 - so what we can do is we can keep the
87:14 - same effect on here
87:16 - but for this one it's going to be for my
87:18 - portfolio
87:20 - item
87:21 - so if my portfolio item comes into focus
87:24 - we want the embedded uh or the embedded
87:27 - the the child the portfolio portfolio
87:31 - image so the the child there to change
87:34 - so now if we come and take a look when i
87:35 - tab on you can see that the tab is also
87:38 - affecting it now the problem is where
87:39 - the outline is does look kind of awkward
87:42 - um now if we want to fix that issue with
87:44 - the focus we will actually have to
87:47 - change one other thing here and that
87:49 - would be my portfolio
87:51 - item focus
87:52 - just on the when that focuses the
87:54 - position will become relative and the z
87:57 - index for that will become a two we
87:58 - can't do that on the image itself
88:00 - because it's the image is inside of
88:03 - the portfolio item so by doing this it
88:06 - should
88:07 - there we go pops out in front and the
88:09 - focus the like green bar
88:12 - if you don't want the green bar you
88:13 - could obviously turn it off as well but
88:15 - i'm going to be keeping that it's going
88:16 - to be very consistent through my whole
88:17 - site
88:18 - in having that so i don't mind that it's
88:20 - there but if you don't really like it um
88:22 - for this one because it's obviously
88:23 - jumping so much when we have her on top
88:26 - i think it would be okay to get rid of
88:27 - it um but for all the other ones i would
88:28 - keep some sort of focus state uh so
88:31 - that's it for the portfolio
88:33 - area here we will design a page for our
88:35 - portfolio items as well but we're not
88:37 - there yet let's finish this page off
88:39 - first
88:42 - all right for this part of the site
88:43 - we're going to be doing the footer which
88:45 - is really straightforward but we're
88:46 - going to be using font awesome for it if
88:48 - you've used font awesome before you can
88:49 - skip this video in the next one we're
88:51 - going to be really setting it up and
88:53 - styling things but if you've never used
88:54 - font awesome before it's really easy to
88:57 - use you can go to their website which is
88:58 - fontawesome.com there's a link to it in
89:01 - the description of this scrimba as well
89:04 - and what you want to do is you want to
89:05 - click on the icons this is because i've
89:07 - already set it up to be using their
89:09 - icons if you're using it on your own
89:11 - site and you haven't got that link yet
89:13 - you can click on the start for free
89:14 - instead give them your email address
89:16 - they're going to send you the link to be
89:18 - using but then in this case we're just
89:20 - going to be clicking on icons and it's
89:22 - going to bring you to their list of
89:23 - icons now for font awesome there is a
89:26 - free set of icons available and a paid
89:28 - set the free ones there's still
89:29 - thousands to choose from but if you are
89:31 - willing to pay for more you get access
89:33 - to up to 7 000 of them which is a lot of
89:35 - icons that you can use
89:37 - in this case we're only going to be
89:38 - using the brands icons so there you can
89:41 - see on the left side you can sort by the
89:42 - different styles of them and the solid
89:45 - are the only ones that are available for
89:46 - free in general
89:48 - but if you do want to get the brands
89:50 - you'll click on that it's only going to
89:51 - bring up the brands or often what's
89:53 - actually easier to do is just to search
89:54 - for the brand you want so if you wanted
89:56 - twitter or github or whatever else uh
89:59 - dribble facebook anything you want just
90:00 - run a search for it and you should be
90:02 - able to find it
90:03 - once you found the icon you want you can
90:05 - click on it so you just literally click
90:07 - on the icon it will bring you to a page
90:09 - that looks like this and
90:11 - all you need to do is click on that
90:14 - where it shows you how you're going to
90:15 - grab it and the cool thing with that is
90:17 - it should automatically copy it from
90:19 - your you copy it from there and then you
90:21 - can paste it directly into your site so
90:24 - i'm going to do that really fast just to
90:25 - show you how it works
90:27 - and now obviously you can't see me over
90:29 - on
90:30 - their site but what i'm going to do is
90:32 - we'll come down all the way to the
90:33 - footer here
90:34 - i have my list items let's clean this up
90:36 - a little bit to make it a little bit
90:37 - easier to read
90:40 - there we go so that's a little bit
90:41 - easier to read we get rid of our a our b
90:43 - our c and our d
90:46 - and here inside my link so i'm in
90:48 - between the opening and closing a i'm
90:50 - going to paste this in and just to make
90:52 - it easier to read we'll put that on its
90:53 - own line as well
90:55 - uh just like that so there we have my
90:58 - fab so it's font awesome brand
91:01 - fab and then font awesome and it's the
91:04 - code pen so if we go and take a look
91:07 - all the way down at the bottom it has
91:08 - changed it over to the code pen icon so
91:11 - i'm quickly going to bring in the other
91:12 - ones
91:14 - and now you can see that they are all
91:16 - there and that they're all working so
91:18 - that is really cool it's a really nice
91:19 - easy way to bring uh social icons into
91:22 - your site if ever you need them and
91:24 - you're going to see in the next video
91:25 - when we style this up it works just like
91:27 - a font so all we need to do is set a
91:29 - font size a font family all of that
91:31 - stuff and our icons should be coming in
91:33 - no pro and everything will be looking
91:35 - really really awesome so we'll see in
91:37 - that video where we style this up
91:42 - all right so we can start styling up our
91:44 - footer now so let's create a little
91:45 - comment to say we're in our footer um
91:47 - one thing i'm going to do right away is
91:49 - actually come and give this a class i
91:51 - know you might say it's redundant of
91:53 - footer just like i did on my nav um so
91:56 - just because i generally like styling
91:58 - everything as much as possible with a
91:59 - class on it uh so i'll put a background
92:02 - on this now i'm gonna do a one one one
92:03 - here i'm not gonna use a custom variable
92:06 - it's just almost black not pure black
92:07 - but almost black so the footer will
92:09 - always be dark if you want to change it
92:10 - obviously we can change that
92:12 - individually
92:13 - but for the color here i will use my
92:16 - accent color for the text
92:18 - my text align will be centered and we'll
92:22 - put a little bit of padding on this not
92:23 - as big as on our other sections but
92:25 - something like that should work out
92:27 - nicely
92:28 - uh the other thing i want to do on my
92:29 - footer is i obviously want the color of
92:31 - my links to come through
92:34 - um so i could choose my footer link and
92:36 - my social list links individually
92:38 - this is one of those times where i might
92:40 - just do something like this and say the
92:41 - color is inherent for everything any
92:44 - link that might end up in my footer so i
92:46 - don't have to worry about it um at all
92:48 - if we go take a look we can see now that
92:51 - everything is styled up it has the
92:53 - colors we want on it the layout
92:54 - obviously needs some fixing up but we're
92:56 - getting there just realized uh jane dev
92:58 - that's okay um
93:01 - so footer a that is good
93:05 - uh the next thing to do is say my footer
93:07 - link
93:08 - link
93:09 - hover
93:10 - and my
93:12 - social
93:13 - social
93:14 - i'm going to give them both an opacity
93:16 - of like 0.7
93:19 - so if we go and take a look at it now
93:21 - we can see that when we're hovering on
93:23 - top it just gives us a nice little
93:25 - subtle hover hover effect
93:27 - and the reason we want to do that if we
93:29 - tab on it you can see it's actually
93:30 - really highlighting it and you might be
93:31 - saying well that doesn't look as nice or
93:33 - i i want to keep that nice little subtle
93:35 - effect for tab navigation the reason i
93:37 - like having a focus state that's
93:39 - different and this is something i've
93:40 - more recently changed but it's when we
93:42 - tab through we can see that it is
93:44 - working um it's really highlighting but
93:46 - we don't you know it we don't know where
93:47 - it's going to bring us next and if it's
93:49 - a really subtle effect where it's just
93:51 - this that's happening you might not even
93:52 - realize when the page jumped down to
93:56 - select something when we tab onto it we
93:58 - don't always realize what's being
94:00 - selected if it's a little subtle effect
94:02 - like an opacity change whereas if
94:03 - there's a big box that's surrounding
94:05 - something i do think it makes it a
94:06 - little bit more obvious what's happening
94:08 - so that's one of the reasons i'm going
94:09 - to keep that focus state just like that
94:12 - i think we're actually going to do two
94:13 - different things here on my footer links
94:15 - we're going to do our color of inherit
94:17 - we're also going to say a text
94:18 - decoration
94:19 - of none just to turn them off
94:21 - as a default
94:24 - but then what we can also have is on my
94:26 - footer
94:28 - link hover not list footer link hover if
94:32 - we want to we can do a text declaration
94:34 - of underline just to bring it back on so
94:37 - when we're off here we don't see it but
94:39 - you know it's a double little whammy
94:41 - just to make it a little bit more
94:42 - obvious that it is some that we are
94:44 - interacting with it i'm going to come up
94:46 - to here just because i like keeping my
94:47 - hover states um sort of separate or
94:49 - underneath so my footer link
94:52 - we're also going to want to change the
94:54 - font size on this one
94:55 - so the font size of this can become my
94:58 - variable font size
95:01 - h3 so it'll be big but not too big and
95:04 - the font weight
95:06 - will also become
95:08 - my variable font weight bold so now we
95:11 - can see that it is i think looking a
95:13 - little bit better we can see that it's
95:14 - nice bold it's a little bit bigger so
95:16 - that is looking awesome let's come on to
95:19 - my social list now
95:21 - um for this one we want a list style of
95:24 - none because we don't want the bullets
95:26 - we want a display of flex which is going
95:28 - to put them next to each other and a
95:30 - just
95:31 - defy content of center to put them right
95:34 - in the middle
95:36 - and i'm also going to add a margin on
95:37 - this
95:38 - just to space it out a little bit and
95:40 - padding of zero because the default
95:42 - padding will make it off-center so let's
95:44 - go take a look and there we go it is
95:46 - looking alright but obviously they're
95:48 - all jammed in and a little bit too close
95:50 - to one another so we can come up and say
95:53 - that my social
95:55 - list
95:56 - items
95:58 - i'm going to give them a bit of margin
95:59 - margin of
96:01 - zero top and bottom but we can add like
96:03 - a 0.5 m left and right
96:06 - and on my social
96:08 - list
96:09 - links
96:10 - i'm also going to give them a bit of
96:11 - padding of say 0.5 m just so it makes it
96:15 - easier to press on them if you're using
96:17 - your finger or something like that there
96:19 - is a bit of space around them that we
96:20 - can click on so that makes that a little
96:22 - bit easier
96:23 - and i think we can probably make them a
96:25 - little bit bigger as well they're kind
96:26 - of tiny right now uh so you know what
96:28 - maybe what we could do is actually move
96:30 - this
96:31 - uh we can move that all the way up here
96:32 - just to my footer itself and say
96:34 - everything inside the footer should have
96:36 - that bigger font size on it
96:40 - um so there we go it will boost the the
96:42 - font size of those icons with it and one
96:45 - of the nice things with font awesome and
96:47 - i think that is looking really really
96:48 - good and dandy i'm super happy with that
96:50 - uh except i just realized one thing i
96:53 - have a margin top and bottom coming on
96:54 - those which means it's sort of setting
96:57 - things off so my social list margin top
97:00 - zero zero we want a margin bottom of
97:02 - zero on the social list just so it
97:04 - doesn't add empty space
97:06 - underneath for nothing so now it should
97:07 - look a little bit more balanced overall
97:09 - and there we have it so we've got all
97:11 - the way to the bottom of the site now in
97:13 - the next video we're going to come all
97:14 - the way back up to the top where we're
97:15 - going to be doing our navigation and
97:17 - getting that to work and getting this
97:19 - page all wrapped up we will be breaking
97:21 - the navigation over a couple of videos
97:23 - because we will have to do a little bit
97:24 - of javascript for that as well
97:28 - so if you remember way back when i
97:30 - turned nav display none on just to get
97:33 - it out of our way and obviously we don't
97:34 - want that so i'm going to delete that so
97:36 - we can actually get started on this
97:37 - navigation and getting it working
97:40 - now one of the reasons i left the
97:41 - navigation to the end is the navigation
97:43 - is a simple enough element is obvi is
97:45 - often one of the ones that actually
97:46 - takes the most styling to set up
97:49 - and can sometimes be
97:51 - a little bit long to do really so the
97:53 - very first thing i'm going to do is just
97:54 - say my logo
97:56 - has a max width
97:58 - of i'm going to say 150 pixels but
98:00 - obviously you can modify that to your
98:02 - own i might even say 100 pixels
98:04 - and you can modify that to control the
98:06 - size of your logo it also doesn't have
98:08 - to be a png you can bring in an svg and
98:10 - that should work fantastically as well
98:13 - and might even be a little bit better
98:15 - so that is setting that up nicely so on
98:19 - my header itself
98:21 - we're going to set this up as a display
98:23 - of flex because we want that to be on
98:25 - the left and we want my button to shoot
98:27 - shoot on over
98:28 - to the right um so on that display flex
98:31 - we're also going to do a justify content
98:33 - space between
98:35 - uh which will spread them out properly
98:37 - and we're going to do a bit of padding
98:40 - on this of say 1m on all the sides just
98:43 - so nothing is touching now that does
98:45 - mean a big screen sizes uh the logo be
98:47 - stuck to the left and eventually our
98:49 - hamburger little button this guy here is
98:51 - going to go over to there now for the
98:53 - navigation itself we're going to be
98:55 - jumping around a little bit on this one
98:56 - uh just so you know so my nav i'm going
98:59 - to give this a position of fixed
99:02 - which is going to pull it out of the
99:03 - flow and is going to make things a
99:05 - little bit better but now you can see
99:06 - the button that we're going to be using
99:08 - has jumped to where we want that button
99:10 - to be and this is sort of in a fixed
99:12 - spot so now as i scroll it's coming with
99:14 - us it's not going to stay like that
99:16 - it's not going to be a fixed navigation
99:18 - in that sense but you're going to see
99:19 - shortly how this is actually going to
99:20 - work
99:22 - um so the button's in the right place
99:24 - we're going to devote an own video to
99:26 - the button itself and because we want to
99:27 - get a hamburger in there we're going to
99:28 - have a little animation on it i just
99:30 - want to get the navigation itself set up
99:33 - so on my nav the position fixed is good
99:35 - but we're also going to give this a
99:36 - background
99:38 - a var
99:39 - color
99:40 - dark and the
99:43 - color itself will give it a var of color
99:46 - light
99:48 - which won't do much yet but we're gonna
99:50 - we're gonna fix that because right now
99:51 - everything is a link in there and we're
99:53 - going to say a top of zero bottom of
99:55 - zero
99:57 - left
99:58 - of zero
99:59 - and a rate of zero so that means it's
100:02 - going to fill up the entire screen
100:04 - and we're going to give it a z index of
100:05 - 100 to pull it in front of everything
100:08 - else so this is when the navigation is
100:10 - open it's going to cover a whole screen
100:12 - even if you scroll or do anything you're
100:14 - always going to see your navigation and
100:15 - then when we close it it will disappear
100:18 - i'm going to be
100:19 - doing we're going to have two different
100:20 - states so what i'm going to do is a
100:21 - transform
100:24 - of translate
100:25 - x we're just going to move it off to the
100:27 - left and my translate x is going to be
100:29 - 100
100:29 - so if that's on you can see that whoop
100:32 - it's gone where'd it go
100:34 - so actually for now let's just put that
100:36 - to 50 just not 550. so you can see what
100:39 - that's doing is it's moving it over 50
100:40 - percent of itself um so it's always
100:43 - based on its own width but its width is
100:44 - 100 so it's 100 of the viewport so if i
100:47 - do 100 it moves the entire thing off of
100:50 - the screen so i'm doing 100 to move it
100:53 - off completely now for now i'm going to
100:54 - leave that at zero
100:56 - but eventually just we can actually
100:58 - style it up and we can see what we're
100:59 - doing but eventually that will be
101:00 - changed and we're going to add a
101:02 - transition on here of the transform
101:04 - 250 50 milliseconds and to be consistent
101:07 - we'll use our cubic bezier and on this
101:10 - once again we'll do a 0.5
101:12 - comma
101:14 - 0 comma 0.5 comma 1 because again it's a
101:17 - nice very similar to ease and out if
101:19 - you'd rather use the ease i know you
101:20 - definitely could we have our nav list
101:24 - so the nav list we're gonna want this to
101:27 - have a let me think uh
101:31 - display of flex and not for or actually
101:34 - before we do that let's just say list
101:36 - style is none um i'm gonna do a display
101:39 - of flex but it's gonna they're still
101:40 - gonna stay on top of each other it's
101:41 - just because we have a few extra things
101:43 - we can add to this
101:45 - so we'll give it a height of 100 so it
101:47 - actually has the height that we want it
101:49 - to
101:49 - and this is where right now because of
101:51 - the display flex they're going next to
101:53 - each other we can't really see them very
101:54 - well so just really fast
101:57 - um just so we can see what's going on
101:59 - nav link
102:01 - so we can see our items are going next
102:02 - to each other because it's display flex
102:05 - but now what i'm going to do is my flex
102:07 - direction
102:08 - will become column
102:10 - which sort of puts it back to how it was
102:12 - you might be going what's the point of
102:13 - that
102:14 - but the nice cool thing with this is
102:16 - then we can use our justify content
102:18 - space evenly
102:20 - and it's going to space them evenly in
102:22 - that vertical space like that
102:24 - and then all we need to do
102:27 - is set and align
102:30 - items center
102:32 - go to spell it right
102:34 - and then everything ends up bang in the
102:36 - middle just like that now there is some
102:38 - extra spacing on that so i'm also going
102:40 - to say that
102:42 - margin of zero padding
102:47 - of zero which should fix any weird
102:49 - issues with the alignment that we were
102:50 - just having
102:51 - on the nav links since we're here
102:54 - we're gonna give them the font
102:55 - weight of var
102:57 - font
102:58 - weight bold we'll also give them the
103:00 - font size let's make them bigger var
103:03 - font size h2 if you had a whole bunch of
103:06 - links on here
103:07 - you may not you may
103:09 - whoops i had a double var on there sorry
103:10 - about that um you might want to avoid
103:13 - the h2 it is quite big
103:16 - maybe it is too big actually
103:17 - but i think it works it's very in your
103:19 - face though um but if you want to step
103:21 - that down to an h3 and you could do that
103:24 - or if you wanted to set your custom size
103:26 - on it as well we could do that but i'm
103:27 - going to leave it with that big bold in
103:29 - your face style of the h2
103:31 - and you can decide if you'd rather
103:33 - something else
103:35 - we're also going to say the text
103:37 - decoration is going to be set to none
103:39 - for those ones
103:40 - we can add in our nav link
103:43 - hover
103:44 - for the hover i think all we'll do is
103:46 - color var color accent and just leave it
103:49 - like that so if we hover on top we can
103:51 - see it's working or if we tab through
103:53 - you can see that that outline is coming
103:55 - through on the focus state that we set
103:57 - for everything so fantastic i think
103:59 - that's looking really nice and good for
104:02 - that
104:04 - but this is the stage where i am going
104:06 - to do
104:07 - all i'm going to do for now actually is
104:08 - come back and set this back to 100
104:11 - to hide it away so it's hidden off the
104:13 - screen and in the next video what we'll
104:15 - do is we'll style up our button and then
104:17 - we'll actually get our button working so
104:19 - when we click it the menu will slide in
104:21 - and out
104:25 - all right so for the hamburger i'm going
104:27 - to bring all of that down right after
104:29 - the nav right here
104:30 - and we can start working on the
104:32 - hamburger itself now there are other
104:33 - ways of doing a hamburger i'm going to
104:36 - do it the more complicated way the only
104:37 - reason i'm doing this is because it
104:39 - opens up some extra possibilities
104:42 - in terms of what we can do with it and
104:44 - to add little animations and have fun
104:46 - with it because all the different pieces
104:48 - will be animatable and individual
104:50 - instead of it just being a single icon
104:52 - but it's up to you if you'd rather just
104:54 - bring in a single icon put it there and
104:55 - leave it like that that's completely
104:57 - fine but you know i think this would be
104:59 - a lot more fun
105:00 - so if you remember we had a class of
105:02 - hamburger so what i'm going to start
105:03 - with is doing our background i'm going
105:05 - to give it the background of our
105:07 - color
105:08 - dark
105:09 - um again if maybe you change your color
105:11 - scheme and you want it to go along with
105:13 - your color scheme it will be useful
105:15 - i'm going to give it a width of 2m and
105:17 - it may have a height of just 3 pixels
105:20 - we'll give it a border radius 2 border
105:22 - radius
105:24 - i'll do 1m which is just like a massive
105:26 - number but
105:27 - because
105:28 - it's going to work and i'm going to give
105:30 - it a display of block not black block
105:33 - because by default it was a span which
105:34 - is inline and i just want to make sure
105:36 - that we don't run into any issues with
105:38 - it and i'm going to give it a position
105:40 - of relative because we're going to be
105:42 - using pseudoelements with absolute
105:43 - positioning and this will make our life
105:45 - much easier
105:46 - so if we come and take a look we can see
105:48 - inside my button now i have that black
105:50 - line that is showing up so that is part
105:52 - one of our hamburger for the next two
105:54 - parts we will be using pseudo-elements
105:56 - so hamburger before
105:58 - and dot hamburger
106:01 - after
106:02 - and just like the pseudo-element that we
106:04 - used last time the first thing we want
106:05 - to do is give it some content but the
106:08 - content will be blank again
106:09 - pseudo-elements will not work unless you
106:11 - do give them some content
106:13 - the position in this case will be
106:14 - absolute so i don't have to declare a
106:16 - position
106:17 - a display a block like i did last time
106:19 - because i have position absolute it's
106:21 - either giving it a position or giving it
106:23 - a display property is required
106:27 - we're going to say a left of zero and a
106:28 - right of zero and that's going to mean
106:30 - it matches the width of our other one
106:33 - again that's because i have positioned
106:34 - relative here if not it would have been
106:36 - relative to the whole screen and we'd
106:38 - have a huge bar going all the way across
106:40 - the background we do need to set so var
106:43 - color dark we have a lot of similarities
106:45 - actually here so i'm going to break some
106:47 - of this off we're going to refractor on
106:49 - the fly here let's copy all this
106:52 - and paste it right there
106:58 - and what i'm going to actually do is add
107:00 - dot hamburger here
107:02 - because they're all going to have
107:05 - this this this and this
107:08 - and even the display block so we can uh
107:10 - we don't need display block on the other
107:11 - ones so i'm going to grab all of that
107:14 - and put it here
107:16 - so we don't have to repeat ourselves
107:17 - twice
107:18 - um they're always going to have the same
107:20 - color same width same height that is and
107:22 - the same border radius so that means i
107:24 - don't need my background color here
107:26 - um and there we go
107:28 - so that is perfect and we will
107:31 - eventually be giving these all a
107:32 - transition as well because we need
107:33 - things to be moving around a little bit
107:35 - so i'm actually going to put that here
107:37 - as well uh transition
107:39 - transform
107:41 - we'll start with 250 and just an ease in
107:43 - out they're going to be pretty simple
107:45 - animations so i don't know if we need
107:47 - that fancy cubic bezier or not oh i
107:49 - forgot my comma right here so that's
107:51 - going to break everything
107:52 - there we go so it looks the same as it
107:54 - did before
107:55 - and the reason is these are pretty much
107:57 - just going to be hiding out underneath
107:58 - what we already have so what i'm going
108:01 - to do is say my dot hamburger
108:04 - before
108:05 - is going to have a top of 6 pixels
108:09 - and my
108:11 - hamburger
108:13 - after is going to have a bottom of 6
108:17 - pixels and the reason i'm doing six is
108:18 - because we have a height of three so
108:21 - it's gonna have a height of three an
108:22 - empty space of three and then we'll have
108:23 - the rest of the hamburger and just like
108:25 - that you can see we're starting to get a
108:27 - little hamburger icon thing coming in
108:28 - there isn't that cool
108:30 - um so it does take a little bit of setup
108:32 - to do it but again i do personally think
108:34 - that it is worth doing the next thing
108:36 - i'm going to do in here is
108:38 - uh let's get come all the way up to here
108:40 - my hamburger so i might nav toggle as
108:43 - well which is the button itself uh this
108:46 - i'm going to add a little bit of padding
108:47 - to it 0.25 m
108:49 - and i'm going to give it a background
108:51 - of of transparent to make it disappear
108:54 - and i'm going to give it a border of
108:56 - zero so my border is turned off
108:59 - and there we go we're left with our
109:00 - little hamburger icon right there uh one
109:03 - thing is it does not have a hover state
109:05 - on it i know you can't see the little
109:06 - hand icons yourselves
109:08 - when i do this but when you're testing
109:10 - it you should be able to so on the nav
109:12 - toggle i'm also going to add a cursor
109:15 - of pointer or else there is no little
109:17 - hand icon for the people when they hover
109:19 - on top of it which can be a little bit
109:20 - strange and i i did 0.25 m we can
109:23 - probably do 0.5 m on that padding and
109:25 - not have it affect anything on terms of
109:28 - its positioning just to give us a bit
109:29 - more room that we can actually click on
109:31 - in that overall area so i think we'll do
109:33 - that for my nav toggle
109:35 - now another thing i'm going to do for my
109:37 - nav toggle is i'm going to give it a
109:39 - position of absolute which is going to
109:41 - sort of ruin things but then i'm going
109:42 - to say that the right
109:44 - is 0 and it should pull it back to
109:46 - exactly where it was
109:48 - uh
109:49 - almost it's not including the padding on
109:51 - there actually so we can say the right
109:53 - so i'll do a 1m on there which is the
109:55 - same as the padding that i put so to
109:57 - keep the distance where we want it to be
110:00 - and if you want to be really safe you
110:02 - could also say a top of 1m
110:04 - the reason i'm doing this is because i'm
110:06 - also going to give it a z index that's
110:07 - really really big
110:09 - so you might remember we had our
110:10 - navigation
110:12 - uh
110:13 - coming in front of everything
110:15 - so when i do that when i had my nav open
110:17 - remember this is going down to a zero
110:20 - i want to make sure that my button
110:22 - actually stays in front of that now it's
110:24 - hard to
110:25 - now you can't see it
110:27 - that it's there but i because the color
110:28 - is the same as my background color but i
110:30 - promise you it is um and that's really
110:32 - important so that's the reason i'm doing
110:34 - that is because we want to always have
110:35 - that button available to us
110:37 - so let's bring that back up to uh or
110:40 - even you know while we're here
110:42 - uh just to prove it to you
110:44 - um let's change this to color accent
110:46 - just for a second
110:48 - and then we can bring
110:49 - that back up to
110:51 - a zero
110:52 - so you can see that that is there so by
110:54 - being position absolute and having a
110:55 - higher z index we know that it's coming
110:57 - all the way in front now there's this
110:58 - problem that we're going to come around
111:00 - and fix soon but for now
111:03 - all of this is starting to come together
111:05 - but let's bring this back up to 100
111:08 - pretty much we need to add in the
111:10 - functionality with the javascript now to
111:11 - actually get that to open and close so
111:13 - we're going to go ahead and do that in
111:14 - the next video
111:18 - all right so what i've done is i've
111:20 - added an index.js file already here in a
111:22 - javascript folder
111:24 - so what we're going to need to do is
111:26 - come into our document and add a script
111:28 - src
111:30 - js
111:32 - index.javascript
111:34 - close script
111:36 - and now we can actually start doing
111:37 - something with it so if we come into
111:39 - here now um we do need to do a few
111:42 - things in here so the first thing i'm do
111:44 - is create a const nav toggle
111:46 - which is going to look for my
111:47 - document.queryselector
111:51 - and we called it nav
111:55 - go and i also want to get uh
111:58 - let's just leave it like that for now
112:00 - i'm going to say our nav
112:02 - toggle
112:03 - add event listener
112:06 - click
112:09 - when we click we want to do a function
112:10 - so i'm going to use an arrow function
112:12 - here
112:12 - and we want the document document.body
112:16 - class list
112:18 - toggle
112:19 - and we're going to toggle a class that
112:21 - we haven't created yet called nav open
112:23 - by doing that it's going to mean every
112:25 - time we click on the
112:28 - our button it should add that class and
112:29 - to test to see if this is actually
112:31 - working or not um what we're going to do
112:34 - is we're going to come over to my
112:36 - css file here
112:38 - and let's create nav i'm going to come
112:40 - all the way after all this nav stuff
112:43 - yeah i'm going to come all the way after
112:44 - all my navigation stuff here
112:46 - but we're going to stick right here msa
112:48 - nav
112:49 - open
112:51 - background is red so again this is on
112:53 - the navigation this is adding this class
112:56 - to the body itself so if we come and
112:58 - take a look and if i click on that the
113:00 - body itself is getting a red background
113:02 - on it and if i click again it should
113:03 - toggle that off and all of that
113:05 - disappears so it is turning on and off
113:07 - just like that
113:10 - so that is awesome and fantastic that it
113:13 - is working so i know my javascript is
113:14 - working so i don't uh so instead of
113:17 - changing the background to red though we
113:19 - have some other things that we want to
113:20 - do so my nav open itself we're not going
113:22 - to be doing anything with but we're
113:23 - going to be doing a lot of things that
113:24 - are inside of here
113:26 - so the first one that we're going to do
113:27 - is
113:28 - my
113:30 - nav itself so if the nav is opened the
113:32 - nav itself is going to get
113:35 - the
113:36 - transform
113:38 - translate x
113:40 - of
113:41 - 0.
113:43 - so what that means is when we click that
113:45 - it slides out when i click again it
113:47 - slides back in so we've added that
113:49 - functionality in
113:50 - and we can see it's working out
113:52 - fantastically it's going in and out and
113:54 - then i can click on my links so that's
113:56 - really cool now there is one problem if
113:58 - i click on a link it's actually going to
113:59 - bring me to that part of the page
114:00 - because you can see it scroll down if i
114:02 - go to my work it's scrolling down
114:03 - further but i can't close it because my
114:05 - icon has disappeared and ideally when we
114:07 - click on it it would just disappear
114:10 - anyway it would close itself when we
114:11 - click on that but we're going to add
114:12 - that functionality in a second
114:14 - for now though what i'm going to do
114:16 - is with my nav open
114:18 - my nav
114:20 - toggle is going to switch from a
114:22 - position absolute to a position of fixed
114:25 - um the reason i'm having it switch is
114:27 - because i don't want it to always be
114:28 - position fixed because i don't want it
114:29 - to scroll with the sight um so now if i
114:31 - click that if i scroll we we still keep
114:34 - this in view but then if we go back to
114:36 - here it scrolls out of view with the
114:37 - rest of my header so that is perfect and
114:39 - that means if i click on about me and
114:41 - then i close it you can see it actually
114:42 - brought me to the right point in my site
114:44 - which is cool
114:46 - so we're off to a good start now where
114:48 - the really fun things also can come in
114:50 - is we can do our nav open dot hamburger
114:54 - and i'm going to do a transform on this
114:57 - of rotate
114:59 - and we're going to rotate it
115:01 - 0.625
115:02 - turns uh so turn like that you can also
115:05 - do this in degrees but i learned about
115:07 - the turn unit and i like showing people
115:09 - that it exists so this is a nice fun one
115:12 - so i can turn it so now what's going to
115:13 - happen when let's scroll back up
115:16 - when i click you can see it's rotating
115:18 - around now that might seem really really
115:20 - strange why would i be doing that
115:22 - well what i also want to do is my nav
115:25 - open dot hamburger
115:28 - uh we'll do my hamburger after we'll
115:30 - just get a opacity of zero so it's just
115:33 - going to disappear
115:35 - but more importantly will be my nav open
115:39 - hamburger
115:41 - before
115:42 - because what we're going to do with this
115:43 - is we're actually going to rotate it
115:45 - rotate
115:46 - oops not rotate transform
115:49 - rotate
115:50 - 90 degrees
115:52 - now we do have to do a second transform
115:54 - on this but you're going to see that
115:55 - what that's doing is it's pretty much
115:56 - turning it into an x
115:58 - so
115:59 - you can see when i click
116:01 - and whoop so that's kind of fun right
116:03 - but the x isn't really working right now
116:05 - because of the way it's positioned so
116:07 - here i'm just going to put a space and
116:08 - do a translate
116:10 - x and the amount is the i'm gonna do
116:13 - negative six pixels because we're you
116:15 - know we're offset by six so moving it
116:17 - back by six pixels and it gives us a
116:19 - nice x
116:20 - so now when we do that way it looks like
116:22 - that and then when i click it's gonna
116:23 - fly around and making this x like that
116:26 - you know what originally i had this as
116:27 - black but i think i'm actually going to
116:28 - keep it with this color
116:30 - so it's always going to be working like
116:32 - that so there we go my hamburger is
116:34 - working everything is good the only
116:37 - problem with it is now if i click on my
116:39 - work it doesn't actually do what we
116:41 - wanted to it brings us there but we want
116:43 - this to also close so we're in the right
116:45 - place right away
116:48 - so to do that we're going to come back
116:49 - to our javascript
116:50 - so to do that we are going to need to
116:52 - get each individual link up here so
116:54 - we're going to create that uh this will
116:56 - be a nav we'll call it nav links and it
116:59 - will be
117:00 - our document dot query
117:04 - selector so this creates a node list
117:06 - create query selector all
117:08 - where it's gonna find all the
117:11 - uh
117:12 - nav.nav link
117:14 - um so it should find all of them so if
117:17 - we go and take a look now
117:18 - or now what we can do is we can say our
117:20 - nav links
117:22 - dot for each so for all of them we have
117:25 - uh for each link inside of there we are
117:28 - gonna do a function um so just like
117:30 - before we're gonna need to create a
117:32 - event listener so on each link we're
117:34 - gonna add an event listener for a click
117:38 - and if somebody clicks once again we
117:40 - will do a function we'll use an arrow
117:41 - function again
117:43 - and uh so here we can say that our
117:46 - document dot body dot class list but at
117:49 - this time instead of toggling it we're
117:50 - just going to remove our nav open from
117:53 - the class list
117:54 - and the reason i want to simply remove
117:56 - it instead of
117:58 - doing anything else with it is because i
118:00 - think it's really important
118:02 - just in case we somehow get it clicked
118:04 - or activated when it's off screen we
118:06 - don't want it to somehow open i don't
118:08 - think that's really a possibility but
118:09 - why take the chance here we're just
118:11 - always removing the class of nav open
118:12 - instead of toggling it because the only
118:14 - way we should be able to click it is if
118:16 - it's already open in the first place yes
118:19 - so let's hit save on that and we should
118:20 - be able to see if we come up we can open
118:23 - it if i click out here nothing's
118:24 - happening but if i click on my services
118:26 - it brings us to my services and it's
118:28 - closed so again we can bring up
118:30 - go to my work and we're in the my work
118:33 - section already and it's closing just
118:35 - like that so it's added a little bit of
118:36 - functionality that we can do when we
118:39 - want to move around in there so
118:41 - just like that that is all done uh you
118:44 - know i think it's looking pretty good
118:45 - now there's one last thing i want to do
118:47 - while we're here
118:48 - when we go to the different sections or
118:50 - let's say i climb and i click on this
118:51 - button it's just jumping to that section
118:54 - which isn't the best user experience so
118:56 - i'm going to come over to my style sheet
118:58 - here i'm going to come all the way up to
118:59 - the top
119:01 - uh we can do that right here under my
119:03 - general styles
119:04 - on my html element
119:06 - i'm going to add in
119:08 - scroll
119:09 - behavior
119:11 - smooth
119:12 - and it's a nice easy way without
119:13 - javascript to add smooth scrolling to a
119:15 - site so let's come back up and now that
119:18 - i'm here if i click on my work it
119:19 - scrolls down there automatically so
119:21 - that's really really cool and if i come
119:22 - up and i go onto one of these links and
119:24 - i do about me you can see it's scrolling
119:25 - down as that closes so if you had other
119:28 - links somewhere else it would
119:29 - automatically just add some smooth
119:30 - scrolling just with native css which is
119:33 - really really awesome now i did have
119:35 - some trouble with this in my own um in
119:38 - here with the scrimba editor when i'm
119:40 - recording it doesn't seem to be an issue
119:42 - and i'm not recording and i've never
119:43 - seen an issue with this outside of the
119:44 - scrimba editor so for now uh or in
119:46 - future videos you may see that it's
119:48 - commented out just make sure you comment
119:50 - it back on in case you run in
119:52 - if you want to have that enabled on your
119:54 - own site if you download from the final
119:56 - version of this uh in it just in case
119:59 - you're worrying about browser support
120:01 - hey we're already using grid and custom
120:03 - properties but if ever you run into a
120:05 - browser that doesn't support it for some
120:07 - reason it's just going to jump down and
120:08 - have the same behavior that it did
120:09 - before so it's not going to cause any
120:11 - issues whatsoever
120:12 - and yeah i think everything is coming
120:14 - together this page is all wrapped up now
120:16 - everything is working fantastically so
120:18 - all we have left to do is create the
120:19 - other page so in the next video we're
120:21 - going to look at doing that it's not
120:22 - going to be anything that is too
120:24 - complicated and then we're gonna be able
120:25 - to wrap this up move on over to
120:27 - digitalocean and get this baby online
120:32 - okay so for this page what i've already
120:34 - done is i've copied my index.html and
120:37 - made a new file here portfolio item.html
120:39 - and i've deleted everything in there
120:41 - this would act as the template file that
120:43 - you could use to build out all your
120:44 - different portfolio items uh to put a
120:46 - bit of information on them i've deleted
120:49 - everything the only thing i've kept is
120:50 - my header and my footer but what we're
120:52 - actually going to do is come back into
120:54 - here and copy
120:55 - this intro section as well and we're
120:58 - going to leave the intro section here
120:59 - but i wanted to copy and paste it just
121:01 - to take a look at how i'm going to do
121:02 - this so here i'd put
121:04 - the title
121:06 - let me keep this strong thing going
121:09 - of my project
121:12 - and then this could just be
121:14 - and the image here i'm going to change
121:16 - to the image that we were originally
121:18 - using so we'll just do port folio 01.jpg
121:22 - it's going to work out perfectly there
121:23 - obviously the alt is going to be a
121:25 - little bit different so we'll get rid of
121:27 - that
121:28 - um so if we come and take a look at what
121:29 - that looks like we can see it right here
121:31 - um it's just putting the picture instead
121:33 - of the picture of yourself that you
121:34 - might have had and everything else
121:36 - should be working fine we've already
121:37 - done all the css for that so it should
121:39 - be working no matter what screen size or
121:41 - anything like that we're on
121:42 - now where things are a little bit
121:44 - different is we do need a new section
121:46 - over here
121:47 - i'm actually going to take this idea of
121:48 - home off we are going to have to update
121:50 - these links as well in a second
121:53 - over here what we're going to do is
121:54 - we're going to add a couple of things so
121:56 - i'm going to add a div class
121:58 - of we'll call it portfolio item
122:02 - individual it's a long name but i want
122:04 - it to be super clear what it's being
122:06 - used for it's not going to have too much
122:08 - styling on it
122:10 - um in here we're going to have a couple
122:11 - of things so we're just going to have
122:12 - let's put in a paragraph
122:15 - we're going to put in an image and i've
122:16 - brought in a new image
122:19 - to use for this one so if we come and
122:20 - look in our images folder
122:22 - you will find a portfolio details.jpg
122:25 - that i brought in just for this page so
122:27 - that is our image folder and then
122:28 - portfolio
122:30 - details dot j jpg
122:33 - i'll put a blank alt because i don't
122:34 - know what the pictures you will be using
122:36 - are um and we don't need a class on that
122:39 - i don't think if we need to put one we
122:40 - can always add one on and i'm going to
122:41 - put a couple more paragraphs
122:44 - down here below it and i'm just going to
122:46 - copy some filler text to use
122:49 - um so if i hit save on that and we come
122:50 - take a look you can see it is coming
122:52 - together we have a nice big image going
122:54 - a long way across which i think is
122:55 - looking cool now we're going to modify
122:57 - this a little bit because the text
122:58 - obviously isn't going to work if it's
123:00 - like that
123:02 - and we're getting
123:04 - but you know overall i think it is
123:06 - actually working out pretty well so
123:08 - we're going to do a couple of
123:09 - interesting things here on this
123:10 - portfolio item individual so let's go
123:12 - into my css
123:13 - and i'm going to include this all the
123:14 - way down at the bottom i can come and
123:16 - put a new comment
123:18 - portfolio item individual and we can
123:21 - style that up a little bit so what i'm
123:23 - going to do is like on the other ones
123:24 - we'll give it a bit of padding so we can
123:26 - do padding of uh we'll leave the top in
123:29 - the bottom uh with
123:30 - i'm gonna leave the top with nothing so
123:32 - we're gonna do a zero for the top we'll
123:34 - do 2m for the left and right uh and
123:35 - maybe we'll do a 2m also on the bottom
123:37 - just to give it a bit of space away from
123:39 - the footer and what i'm also going to do
123:41 - i'm going to give this a max width of
123:43 - 1000 pixels because it is a standard
123:45 - that we've used in a couple of other
123:46 - places in the site and with a max width
123:48 - there we also want to do a margin of
123:50 - zero auto
123:52 - and just like that we've sort of
123:54 - finished what we need to do here i don't
123:56 - want to do anything too fancy we can
123:57 - keep the nice title area and then here
124:00 - we fall into these nice big images with
124:02 - some description of what your project
124:04 - actually is you can throw as many images
124:05 - in there as you want
124:07 - if you do find the text is getting too
124:08 - long you could change the max width on
124:10 - that or we could come in and say
124:13 - the same class but our paragraphs inside
124:16 - of there and give them a max width of
124:18 - like 800 pixels maybe
124:20 - and you can play with that number
124:22 - what it's going to do is just give you
124:23 - something like this where the images
124:24 - will be wider
124:26 - in general i like doing things like that
124:28 - because it makes it a little bit easier
124:30 - to read
124:31 - text when it's not too long and i might
124:33 - even shrink that down to like 600
124:36 - and if we do that we can also give this
124:38 - a margin in left
124:40 - of auto and a margin right
124:43 - of auto i'm not doing a margin 0 auto or
124:46 - something like that because i want to
124:47 - keep the top and bottom margins the
124:49 - default margins that were already on my
124:51 - paragraphs because it means we're
124:52 - getting the spacing where it would take
124:55 - those off
124:56 - so it sort of focuses our text we can
124:58 - have bigger images that break out of
124:59 - that a little bit and then we still have
125:01 - our regular paragraphs that describe the
125:03 - project a little bit
125:04 - the more text you have the more you can
125:06 - describe a project don't just talk about
125:08 - what you you know what the project was
125:10 - but talk about what you did on the
125:12 - project and why that was a good thing
125:13 - the more details you can put and the
125:15 - more information you can give on the
125:16 - insights of your project instead of on
125:18 - the actual project itself
125:20 - the better that could be but this will
125:22 - set the template for you to have a nice
125:24 - simple page that you can use for your
125:26 - portfolio items
125:28 - the one thing we do want to make sure is
125:29 - if we click here we can actually go back
125:31 - to the pages that we want to go back
125:32 - onto so what i'm going to do is the home
125:35 - i'm just going to set to be index.html
125:39 - and i'm going to copy this
125:42 - and paste it there but leaving the
125:44 - hashtag at the end and the reason i'm
125:46 - doing that is because now
125:49 - we're on my individual project if i
125:51 - click here and i go to home it'll bring
125:52 - me back to here but what i've done is
125:55 - i've put the links to all of these just
125:56 - to go to that page
125:58 - um if i click here and i go to about me
126:00 - it's going to bring me to the about part
126:02 - of that page so it's always going to go
126:04 - back to the right place if somebody
126:06 - looks at a portfolio item and then they
126:08 - decide they want to go look at something
126:09 - else they can get to that section really
126:11 - really easily
126:13 - without any fuss so
126:15 - right now as i mentioned i've put the
126:17 - links to all of them going to this one
126:18 - template page but that would be
126:20 - up to you now to populate as many
126:22 - portfolio pages as you need and to set
126:24 - all of that up for your different
126:26 - portfolio items and that is it we are
126:28 - done with this template everything is
126:30 - good and dandy and working fantastically
126:34 - and that is it for now the website is
126:36 - all put together it's ready to go so in
126:37 - the next video we're going to be talking
126:38 - about the next steps and how you can
126:39 - start getting this online
126:44 - all right so we're going to look at how
126:45 - we can customize the fonts the colors
126:47 - and different things with this site so
126:49 - we'll start off with the fonts then
126:50 - we'll move into the colors it's all
126:51 - super easy to customize so let's say you
126:54 - found some new fonts on google font so
126:56 - that's what i have done and i have a new
126:58 - link i'm going to update this link with
127:00 - my new one
127:01 - just remember you have to do it on all
127:02 - your pages don't just do it on v1 so i
127:05 - update that link there and then i'm
127:06 - going to go over to my css
127:08 - and over here in my css i can update my
127:11 - font families so i'm going to put roboto
127:13 - as my secondary here and then i have
127:16 - laura that i'm going to bring in as my
127:18 - primary so if i just do that my font
127:21 - weights are going to switch over to 400
127:23 - and 700 because those are the weights
127:24 - that i brought in and just like that we
127:26 - can see that it has updated the fonts
127:28 - throughout the whole site super nice and
127:31 - easily really quickly everything will be
127:33 - updated because they were all set up to
127:34 - be using those font families and using
127:37 - those custom properties and just like
127:39 - that we can also update our colors super
127:42 - super easily so let's say you don't like
127:43 - that green that's not your brand color i
127:45 - can come on to my color accent and
127:47 - update that one to a red color and just
127:49 - like that anywhere that was using it in
127:51 - the site has now switched on over to use
127:53 - that red color and of course if you
127:55 - wanted to switch the entire theme
127:58 - i did use a light and a dark but
128:00 - technically you could come in here and
128:02 - do something like this and it would
128:04 - invert your color scheme throughout the
128:06 - whole site so now it has become a dark
128:08 - site i can't see my logo anymore
128:10 - but everything else should be working
128:11 - there'd be a few little updates that
128:13 - we'd have to make
128:14 - in a couple places for the dark theme to
128:16 - work or this not really even a dark
128:17 - theme it's an inverted theme from what i
128:19 - had but overall you can see that it's
128:21 - really really quick and easy to make
128:23 - these changes to the site and everything
128:25 - will be running super well and super
128:27 - easily so if ever you want to customize
128:29 - stuff play with the box shadows play
128:30 - with the font sizing all of it all you
128:32 - have to do is play with these custom
128:33 - properties and you are good to go your
128:36 - design is your own design after that so
128:38 - have some fun with it make it your own
128:40 - and then we're going to be looking at
128:41 - how we can get this up on digital ocean
128:46 - in this video we're going to be
128:48 - exploring digital ocean droplets we're
128:50 - going to be seeing what a droplet
128:51 - actually is and how you can get one up
128:52 - and running
128:54 - so what is a droplet
128:57 - this is directly from their website they
128:59 - say the digital ocean droplets are
129:00 - linux-based virtual machines that run on
129:02 - top of virtualized hardware each droplet
129:04 - you create is a new server you can use
129:06 - either standalone or as part of a larger
129:08 - cloud-based infrastructure now that
129:10 - might sound a little bit confusing but
129:12 - really they're pretty simple in how they
129:14 - work they're essentially virtual servers
129:16 - that can host your website when web apps
129:19 - they're extremely easy to use they're
129:21 - fast and easy to set up and destroy
129:23 - which means that if you set one up you
129:24 - just want to test something out you do a
129:26 - little bit of work on it and you want to
129:27 - get rid of it right away after you can
129:28 - do it right away it would take seconds
129:30 - to destroy one if you don't want to have
129:32 - it anymore they come with an automatic
129:33 - firewall security is really easy with
129:36 - digital ocean and they do really
129:38 - emphasize a lot when it comes to making
129:40 - sure that things are as safe as possible
129:43 - they're both extremely customizable and
129:45 - super flexible so when you're setting it
129:46 - up you can really customize all the
129:48 - different settings you need for it but
129:50 - they're flexible in the sense that you
129:51 - can make changes to it once it's set up
129:53 - you don't have to destroy it and create
129:54 - a new one just because you need to make
129:56 - a few changes to what you already had
129:58 - you can just modify your existing one
130:00 - and one of the best things about them is
130:02 - you only pay for exactly what you're
130:04 - using so it can you know if you use if
130:06 - you spin one up you only run it for like
130:08 - 15 minutes you're not paying a monthly
130:10 - fee like you might with another web
130:12 - hosting company where you've just locked
130:14 - yourself into a year when you you're
130:16 - only paying for your droplets that
130:17 - you're currently using if you're not
130:19 - running any droplets you're not paying
130:20 - you fire one up you get rid of it you
130:22 - only paid for that three seconds it was
130:24 - up there that's all you're actually
130:25 - paying for now how do we set up a
130:27 - droplet it is relatively easy to do um
130:30 - what you want to do is create your
130:32 - account first and use the link that is
130:34 - in the description to get your free 50
130:36 - credit so you can use that towards
130:38 - testing everything out before you start
130:39 - jumping in now when you first create
130:42 - your account it's also going to ask you
130:43 - to make your first project once you've
130:45 - made your first project you can just
130:47 - click here on droplets if you're not
130:49 - sure about setting up your project don't
130:50 - worry about it too much it's going to
130:51 - ask you some really basic questions and
130:53 - you'll be all set up and ready to go and
130:54 - you can always create new projects as
130:56 - many as you need to inside of
130:58 - digitalocean so once you're logged in
131:00 - you're ready to go you can click on
131:01 - droplets on the side here and there's a
131:03 - nice big button that should say create
131:05 - droplet because you won't have any
131:06 - droplets yet when you get there you're
131:08 - going to run into this and this can seem
131:10 - a little bit intimidating if you've
131:12 - never had to look at this before because
131:14 - they are running on linux so you have to
131:16 - choose your distribution of linux that
131:18 - you want and choose your plan your
131:20 - pricing and all of that and you might be
131:21 - looking at this going i don't know what
131:23 - distribution of linux that i want
131:25 - because i've never really had to worry
131:26 - about that before that's completely fine
131:28 - they do make our life a little bit
131:30 - easier uh what i'm going to suggest you
131:32 - do is instead of worrying about the
131:33 - distributions right now is click on
131:35 - where it says marketplace the
131:36 - marketplace is a whole bunch of setups
131:39 - that are sort of pre-created everything
131:41 - is lined up it has all the different
131:42 - things you're going to need so you can
131:44 - choose from here you'll see here are the
131:46 - recommended for you they do have a
131:47 - wordpress one there so if you want to
131:48 - spin up a wordpress a wordpress really
131:51 - fast and quickly you just click on that
131:53 - and there'll be a few more steps at this
131:55 - stage though what i'm going to do is
131:56 - suggest that we go and click on where it
131:58 - says see all marketplace apps that's
132:00 - going to show us all the available ones
132:02 - if you scroll down you can see there's
132:04 - 110 results there's a whole bunch of
132:05 - stuff in there so if you know exactly
132:07 - what you want you might find something
132:08 - that is perfect for your needs maybe you
132:11 - just want a node.js server because for
132:13 - this case we're going to go with a lemp
132:14 - stack so limp and you might have heard
132:16 - of lamp which is a linux
132:18 - apache mysql and php
132:21 - and we're going to go with lemp so
132:22 - instead of apache it's running nginx
132:24 - because i'm doing it with static files
132:26 - it is going to run a little bit faster
132:28 - so we're really not sure which one to
132:29 - pick we can go with follow along with
132:30 - this one for now but if you have a
132:32 - certain build that you want go and look
132:34 - through their marketplace they might
132:35 - have something exactly that's going to
132:36 - meet your needs once you do that it's
132:38 - going to bring you to this page where
132:39 - it's just going to give you more
132:40 - information on what this marketplace
132:43 - lump stack is so it's showing you all
132:44 - the different software that it's going
132:46 - to be installing we're not even worried
132:47 - that it's bringing us you know we don't
132:49 - even really need the mysql or php right
132:51 - now but we're it's coming with
132:53 - everything it's pre-setup it's ready to
132:54 - go right out of the box so now we can
132:56 - just click on create limp droplet and
132:58 - when we click that it's going to bring
132:59 - us back to this screen where it used to
133:01 - have the linux distributions along the
133:03 - top but now it's brought us back it's
133:05 - replaced that with saying that we're
133:07 - using our limp stack here
133:09 - and then it's going to ask us to choose
133:10 - a plan now if you're doing something
133:12 - that's a really big site or you need
133:13 - something really specific you might want
133:15 - to go into one of these performance
133:16 - plans and if you're not sure which one
133:18 - you want you can go with help me choose
133:20 - for now we're going to go with the
133:21 - starter standard one here this is
133:23 - perfect for something like ours which is
133:24 - a static site right now or even things
133:26 - like blogs and web apps all of that this
133:28 - is a great place to start if ever you
133:30 - need to make a change as i said it is
133:31 - very flexible
133:33 - once you've chosen the starter planner
133:35 - that's already going to be selected by
133:36 - default we want to go into the pricing
133:38 - and by default the pricing is set to the
133:39 - 40 a month early on i would suggest
133:42 - scroll all the way over and go with the
133:43 - five dollar per month one um it's
133:45 - probably all you're going to need at the
133:47 - beginning unless you know you're going
133:48 - with something that where you're going
133:49 - to need a little bit more than that so
133:50 - you can see it's giving us one cpu uh
133:53 - it's giving us an ssd with 25 gigabytes
133:55 - of space and it's giving us a thousand
133:57 - gigabytes of transfer i think starting
133:59 - off that is perfectly fine but you get
134:01 - what you pay for so if you need
134:03 - something more powerful or more space
134:04 - you can always work your way up now if
134:07 - all you need is more ssd space but you
134:09 - don't need more transfer or a more
134:11 - powerful cpu
134:12 - you can go to add block storage and add
134:14 - volume so you can just add ssd space so
134:16 - you can just add hard drive space that
134:18 - way it's where you're adding on to there
134:20 - but you're not getting anything else so
134:21 - you can balance out the pricing a little
134:23 - bit if that's the only extra thing that
134:24 - you need
134:26 - and once you've added your block storage
134:28 - if you need it we won't in this case you
134:30 - can then choose a data center region i
134:32 - went with toronto because i'm in
134:33 - montreal so it's close to me you can
134:35 - just choose any of the ones around the
134:36 - world that they have just choose
134:38 - something close to you and you're good
134:39 - to go
134:40 - and then it's going to also ask you to
134:42 - select additional options if you want
134:44 - private networking ipv6 user data and
134:46 - monitoring it's up to you if you want
134:48 - any of them for now we're going to skip
134:49 - those and we're going to come down to
134:50 - the authentication now here the default
134:53 - is one time password we're going to
134:55 - leave it on one time password and ssh
134:57 - key is a lot more secure so if it's
134:59 - something that's going to be a client
135:00 - site or even your personal site in the
135:02 - long run it could be worth setting up
135:04 - but for the time being we're going to go
135:05 - with a one-time password because it's
135:07 - faster and simpler to set up and you can
135:08 - always switch to an ssh key later on
135:11 - you're not stuck with this you're not
135:12 - stuck with your one-time password if you
135:14 - do want to change to the ssh key later
135:17 - and the last thing after that we're
135:19 - getting right near the end we need to
135:20 - choose how many droplets we want so by
135:22 - default it's one we're good with one and
135:24 - we want to choose a hostname so it's a
135:26 - random string of characters you can
135:27 - change it to what you want it to be
135:29 - and it's just so you can remember them
135:31 - by your droplet name can only contain
135:33 - so you just want to make it something
135:34 - you can remember it by so just give it a
135:36 - name that makes sense to you and if you
135:39 - want to add any tags you can you're
135:40 - going to select the project you only
135:42 - have one project so just attach it to
135:44 - that project and you can add backups if
135:46 - you want backups are system level
135:48 - backups taken once a week and each one
135:50 - is retained for four weeks and they
135:51 - always cost twenty percent of the
135:52 - droplet price so because ours is five
135:54 - dollars a month it would cost us an
135:56 - extra one dollar per month now if you're
135:57 - going to be working on uh git and say
135:59 - you're on github or something like that
136:01 - and every time you push to your master
136:02 - it's automatically building out your
136:04 - site that's really awesome that's cool
136:05 - and that's sort of keeping track of
136:07 - everything anyway but backups are always
136:09 - a good thing to have especially if it's
136:11 - something like a client site or your own
136:13 - personal site
136:14 - if it's your client side or your
136:15 - portfolio site and you want to make sure
136:17 - that nothing ever goes wrong i'd
136:19 - strongly encourage you to have a backup
136:21 - because in this day and age and at that
136:23 - price i think it is quite affordable
136:24 - next we're going to do is click on
136:26 - create droplet and that's going to bring
136:27 - us to this screen where you're going to
136:28 - see the little progress bar going along
136:31 - it generally takes under a minute to
136:33 - create your droplet so that blue
136:34 - progress bar will slowly make its way
136:36 - across and then you'll get this where it
136:38 - disappears and you're going to get your
136:40 - ip address this is where your site is
136:42 - your site is at that address as soon as
136:44 - you see this you could technically go
136:46 - and visit it there's not much to see
136:47 - there right now so instead of going to
136:49 - visit it what i'd encourage you to do is
136:51 - click on where it says my portfolio when
136:53 - we click on my portfolio it's going to
136:55 - bring us into this screen
136:56 - and what we're going to want to do is
136:58 - click where it says console because one
137:00 - thing we have to do before we can do
137:02 - anything else is we need to reset our
137:03 - password when we signed up for a
137:05 - one-time password it's going to email us
137:07 - that password but the password has to be
137:09 - reset the first time you put it in so
137:11 - when we click on the console here it's
137:13 - actually going to open a console in the
137:15 - browser in a new window you could be
137:16 - doing this if you're on mac through
137:18 - terminal or if you're on pc through
137:19 - powershell or commander or something
137:21 - like that but you know we have this
137:22 - built in it's the nice simple terminal
137:24 - that's just it's directly connected to
137:26 - your droplet so it's going to ask you
137:27 - for your login and it will ask you for
137:29 - your password you should have received
137:31 - an email that's going to have both of
137:33 - those things so you'll see your ip
137:34 - address your username and your password
137:37 - i don't mind showing you my password
137:38 - because as i said it has to be reset as
137:40 - soon as you put it in the username will
137:42 - always be root so you can put in root
137:44 - where your login name goes and then it's
137:46 - going to ask for your password i would
137:48 - go to here i would copy it so command
137:50 - select it command or control c and then
137:53 - you come over to here and you paste it
137:54 - in with if you're on a pc control v or
137:57 - if you're on a mac command v and that's
137:59 - going to paste it in now when you paste
138:01 - it in it's not going to look like
138:02 - anything happen because it stays blank
138:04 - that's fine just hit enter or return and
138:06 - it's going to go to the next step
138:08 - it's a password they're trying to make
138:10 - it stay confidential so they don't show
138:12 - it on the screen when you're entering
138:13 - your passwords in a terminal uh once you
138:15 - put the password in it's gonna say
138:16 - you're required to change your password
138:18 - immediately so right away it's gonna ask
138:20 - for your current password so just
138:21 - command v again and paste it in there
138:24 - and then it's going to ask for your new
138:25 - password so you type in a new password
138:27 - once again as you're typing it it's
138:28 - going to look it's just going to be
138:29 - blank it's going to look like there's
138:30 - nothing there that's completely fine
138:32 - just keep on going it's going to ask you
138:34 - to retype it again just to make sure you
138:35 - spelled everything right and as soon as
138:37 - you've done that it's going to give you
138:38 - a little message saying that everything
138:40 - is pretty much good to go and you can
138:42 - close this window down once you've done
138:44 - that if you visit your ip address after
138:46 - that you're going to see something that
138:48 - looks like this so it's not very
138:49 - exciting it's saying please log into
138:51 - your droplet to configure the lamp
138:52 - installation and now we want to get our
138:54 - site up on here instead of seeing a
138:57 - screen like this so we're going to look
138:58 - at how we can do that in the next video
139:04 - all right so let's see how we can put
139:05 - our files onto our droplet uh we're
139:08 - going to be doing it with an ftp client
139:09 - so some ftp software that you might want
139:11 - to use there's filezilla cyberduck or
139:13 - fetch you can click on any of these here
139:15 - it's going to bring you right to their
139:16 - website
139:17 - fetch is probably the easiest one to use
139:18 - but it is mac only but the interface is
139:21 - the cleanest and simplest one so if
139:23 - you're on mac maybe you'd want to go
139:24 - with fetch for this though i am going to
139:26 - be using filezilla i am on pc i want to
139:28 - do something that both pc and mac users
139:30 - could follow along with so i am using
139:32 - filezilla but it's always the same thing
139:34 - and there's other ftp clients out there
139:36 - as well it's not just these three use
139:38 - whichever one you want the interface
139:39 - might be a little bit different but the
139:41 - information is the same no matter which
139:43 - one you are using so here i have
139:45 - filezilla opened and what i'm going to
139:47 - want to do is click on this weird little
139:49 - icon that's in the left here and what
139:50 - that's going to do is it's going to open
139:52 - my site manager inside my site manager i
139:54 - clicked on new site just to create a
139:56 - site i called it a do for digital ocean
139:59 - portfolio and then i came over to my
140:00 - protocol and i changed it to sftp which
140:03 - is the ssh file transfer protocol and
140:06 - then here i need to put in my host and
140:08 - my port number the host is just going to
140:10 - be your ip address and the port we're
140:11 - going to use is 22 which is for the sftp
140:14 - if you wanted to go in through a regular
140:16 - ftp you could use port 80 um it's going
140:18 - to ask for your uh on my login type i'm
140:20 - saying ask for password that was where
140:22 - it was i'm going to leave it like that
140:23 - in my user i'm going to put in root
140:25 - right there once i put in my username
140:27 - there i can just click on connect all
140:29 - the way down here and it's going to pop
140:31 - up with something that looks like this
140:32 - it's saying unknown host key the
140:34 - server's host key is unknown you have
140:36 - you have no guarantee that the server is
140:38 - the computer you think it is and it's
140:40 - showing the fingerprint for there and
140:41 - this is just saying are you sure you're
140:42 - connecting to the right place we can't
140:44 - be 100 sure because the key is an
140:46 - unknown key this is because we haven't
140:49 - set it up with ssh
140:51 - we can for now just click on always
140:52 - trust this host because we know so we're
140:55 - adding that to our cache click that and
140:57 - click ok
140:59 - then it's going to ask you for your
141:00 - password so you put in your password
141:02 - that you just created in the terminal in
141:03 - the last video and it's going to log you
141:06 - into your droplet now the way filezilla
141:08 - works is everything on the left here is
141:10 - my computer and everything on the right
141:11 - here is my droplet this is all the
141:13 - different things that are in my droplet
141:15 - a lot of this got created because i went
141:17 - with the lemp stack so it created a
141:19 - whole bunch of stuff that's already in
141:20 - here now by
141:22 - when you start with you might be inside
141:23 - your root folder so you might have to
141:24 - take a step back and then once you've
141:26 - taken that step back you're going to
141:27 - want to find the var folder so it's var
141:30 - var folder once you're inside the var
141:32 - folder you're going to want to look for
141:34 - a www folder and then once you find the
141:37 - www there should only be one thing in
141:39 - there which is the html folder click on
141:42 - that html folder and you should see that
141:43 - there's an index file in there and that
141:45 - is it and what we want to do is we want
141:47 - to replace that index.html file with our
141:49 - own files so i've downloaded mine from
141:52 - scrimba if you want to follow along with
141:54 - exactly that at the moment and download
141:56 - from scrubber itself i'm going to do
141:57 - that at the very end of this video we'll
141:59 - look at how we can do that so what i did
142:01 - is i downloaded everything from scrimba
142:03 - i opened up the folder i unzipped it and
142:04 - then i grabbed all the files i needed it
142:06 - was everything except for the normalize
142:08 - and the readme if you put those up there
142:10 - it's not going to cause any problem but
142:11 - we don't need those files we might so
142:13 - there's no reason to put them online so
142:15 - i grabbed those i literally just dragged
142:17 - over to here you can see that it's there
142:19 - i let go and it's going to tell me that
142:21 - there's already index.html do i want to
142:23 - replace it yes i do and with in probably
142:26 - under a second everything was uploaded
142:28 - once it was all uploaded i went back to
142:30 - here i hit refresh so this is just on
142:32 - the ip address i was on i hit refresh
142:34 - and bang just like that my site is up
142:37 - here it's live and it is available for
142:40 - anybody to see it's as easy as that to
142:42 - get a site up on a digital ocean droplet
142:46 - now if you do want to download from
142:47 - scrimba you just go to the very last
142:49 - video but just make sure you scroll all
142:50 - the way to the end because wherever you
142:52 - are in the video it's going to download
142:54 - that state so make sure you're at the
142:55 - end of the last video where we're
142:57 - creating the website and if you go to
142:59 - the little gear icon you can scroll you
143:01 - can go down to where it says download
143:02 - zip click on that and it's going to
143:04 - download all the files for you so if you
143:06 - want to test it out and put everything
143:07 - else and put it all up there or then
143:10 - make maybe make your own changes to it
143:11 - and then put it up there you can go
143:13 - ahead and do that
