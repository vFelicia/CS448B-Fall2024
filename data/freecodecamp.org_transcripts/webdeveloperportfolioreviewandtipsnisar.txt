00:00 - hey guys benjamin's back here thanks for
00:02 - tuning in uh so i'm just doing a quick
00:05 - portfolio review for uh nasir i believe
00:08 - is how you pronounce it i'm gonna do
00:10 - just the desktop and the mobile version
00:12 - of it uh just give my first impressions
00:14 - on the overall responsiveness some of
00:17 - the animations the font the layout etc
00:20 - etc
00:21 - um
00:22 - i think i'm also going to go ahead and
00:24 - reviews his social media presence as
00:27 - well
00:28 - just as a little added bonus um you know
00:30 - hopefully he appreciates that
00:32 - uh but yeah he had reached out to me on
00:34 - twitter i introduced him to the
00:37 - uh codecareer.org discord community
00:40 - which you can just get to by going to
00:41 - codecareer.org discord and uh in there
00:45 - he got some decent feedback from one of
00:47 - our admins alex and he'll also be
00:50 - getting a little bit of feedback from me
00:51 - so anyway without further ado let's go
00:53 - to dive in
00:55 - so at first right off the bat he has a
00:58 - nice introduction says hi i'm the seer
01:00 - uh let's see
01:03 - okay dig that
01:05 - um
01:07 - i love performance as much as expert and
01:10 - i try to be my best to create ux rich
01:14 - performance websites and web apps
01:17 - okay um
01:22 - i suppose the only thing i see here is
01:25 - if um
01:27 - if you're gonna if nasir is going to do
01:30 - um you know capital case where like each
01:33 - letter
01:34 - um of each word is capitalized then i
01:37 - would ideally apply that rule to
01:40 - anything that's four letters or more
01:42 - so it would capitalize much and
01:45 - capitalize create
01:49 - personally though
01:50 - i think i would prefer
01:52 - in on my own website just to have
01:55 - everything
01:56 - uh you know a standard case so you just
01:58 - have like the eyes capitalized and then
02:00 - all of the other
02:02 - letters under here are lowercase
02:04 - i feel like that adds a better
02:07 - contrast between the header here and
02:09 - then the the subheader or description
02:13 - because this is quite a bit of text i
02:14 - would kind of regard it as a description
02:16 - um
02:17 - so i just kind of like to see that
02:19 - contrast personally
02:20 - but um overall good
02:23 - cool and it looks like you have a nice
02:24 - nifty animation here when you go ahead
02:26 - and hover over that dig that
02:28 - and it looks like it comes as a pop-up
02:31 - all right i like the pop-up the
02:34 - font is nice the overall layout here is
02:37 - great i like the separation of colors
02:40 - dig that animation that's good
02:42 - uh let's see grab my cv find out more
02:44 - about me
02:46 - all right just take a quick look at this
02:49 - okay cool
02:52 - uh okay going back
02:55 - um
02:57 - one thing i might
02:59 - recommend is
03:01 - keep
03:03 - well
03:06 - that's
03:07 - excuse me on second thought i do
03:08 - actually like the color difference of
03:10 - the footer here
03:11 - and the the button because it does cause
03:14 - the button to stay up or stand out i was
03:17 - initially going to recommend keeping
03:18 - these the same color but i like what you
03:20 - did there
03:22 - um i think the one thing
03:25 - i would recommend is maybe changing this
03:27 - font playing with it just a little bit
03:29 - maybe making it a little bit brighter
03:32 - you know a little bit more of like a
03:34 - whitish color
03:36 - just to make your key details stand out
03:39 - but at the same time i also understand
03:41 - that you want your core focus to be
03:44 - the user clicking on the download button
03:46 - so
03:48 - i don't know i think there's there's a
03:49 - balance there and you did strike the
03:51 - balance pretty well
03:52 - um
03:56 - yeah i suppose whichever way you're
03:58 - leaning like if you if you
04:00 - want to
04:01 - make that information more apparent then
04:03 - i would make it a brighter color if you
04:07 - want to make it a little bit less
04:08 - distracting and really focus in on the
04:10 - download button then it would make the
04:12 - font there uh down here a little bit
04:15 - smaller
04:17 - maybe keep it the same color you know
04:19 - just then that way it's not as
04:22 - predominant it's not pulling as much
04:24 - attention away from the download button
04:27 - excuse me if that's the key focus that
04:29 - you want to have
04:30 - but overall dig it alright so let's
04:33 - close that out
04:38 - now this is a nice large out excuse me a
04:42 - nice large chunk of text
04:45 - can't speak tonight um
04:47 - personally i kind of like to break
04:49 - things up a little bit so if you have
04:51 - like say three maybe four sentences
04:53 - um
04:54 - i would break that up into separate
04:56 - paragraphs or
04:57 - personally i'm a fan of one to two
04:59 - sentences per paragraph uh just because
05:02 - for readability people love to
05:05 - kind of skim things and it just it makes
05:07 - it easier on the eye uh you know there's
05:09 - much less reader fatigue but overall
05:11 - looks good
05:13 - um
05:15 - i think again on this it would follow
05:18 - the you know a very similar uh
05:20 - capitalized case as your
05:23 - description or subheader here
05:26 - you know try to keep
05:27 - this capital case so each letter of a
05:32 - larger
05:33 - word is capitalized and then keep this
05:35 - lowercase
05:36 - with the exception of the start of every
05:38 - sentence
05:39 - um
05:41 - yeah because it's just it looks really
05:43 - weird to the eye
05:44 - um to the eye to see
05:48 - uh you know like you looking web
05:50 - developer capitalized but then there's
05:53 - uh like this is lowercase
05:55 - that's lowercase that's lowercase
05:57 - um but then it comes back to these being
06:00 - uppercase
06:01 - um
06:02 - just looks a little strange at first
06:03 - glance so that's one thing i think i
06:05 - would address
06:06 - um again love the animation though let
06:08 - me go ahead and click that
06:10 - cool and that brings you right to
06:12 - twitter
06:18 - alright and your skill set
06:20 - again probably the same feedback in
06:22 - terms of
06:24 - uh you know breaking this out making it
06:26 - look a little bit more readable
06:28 - um
06:29 - one to two sentences per paragraph again
06:32 - same thing with the text um you know
06:35 - staying consistent with the the capital
06:37 - case
06:38 - uh setup that you have or lowercase
06:40 - setup
06:41 - um
06:44 - another thing you could do i do actually
06:46 - like
06:47 - the
06:48 - overall readability of this like just
06:50 - peppering in or or putting in your
06:54 - skill sets in in text i like that i like
06:57 - the
06:58 - the dotting that you use for the
06:59 - underlining
07:01 - maybe though i would
07:03 - write like a paragraph or so about your
07:05 - skills like right here
07:08 - and then kind of like list some of your
07:10 - skills so like one to you know like um
07:13 - under that so i have like a skill here
07:16 - and a skill here
07:17 - and just kind of break it up so that
07:19 - they're like separate you know words um
07:22 - and you know maybe even add a
07:25 - an icon to
07:27 - some of these skills like css sas
07:30 - babel
07:31 - redux reacts those all have their own
07:34 - uh
07:35 - logos and icons for those
07:38 - but um yeah overall looks good let's
07:40 - take a look at your work
07:42 - okay so that just scrolls down to
07:45 - there at the bottom
07:48 - okay i'm just gonna scroll back up to
07:50 - the about me
07:52 - um yeah same thing i recommended with
07:54 - previous text
07:59 - see now this this looks okay to the eye
08:01 - because
08:02 - uh you know this is a couple of
08:04 - sentences i think that looks decent
08:06 - and
08:08 - it looks like you were consistent about
08:11 - the um
08:12 - [Music]
08:13 - the capitalization on this as well so
08:16 - this you have as capital case unless you
08:18 - have this lower case that looks good
08:21 - um front end to back ends cool like the
08:23 - graphics
08:25 - uh
08:27 - would probably try to
08:30 - rewrite this a little bit just to make
08:31 - it a little bit shorter try to bring it
08:33 - down to
08:34 - maybe this much text
08:36 - same thing with this keep them
08:38 - relatively the same consistent length
08:41 - and
08:46 - i like that you write their skewb center
08:48 - rely on a lot of your text but i
08:50 - personally feel like you would best
08:52 - benefit from just having this as the
08:54 - center aligns to make it kind of
08:56 - stylistic and draw the eye down to the
08:58 - hire me button
09:00 - but then
09:01 - when it comes to
09:02 - to this text
09:04 - i would probably make it left aligned
09:06 - just so that it's easier to read
09:08 - same thing with skill set about me
09:12 - um
09:13 - and probably these blocks of code here
09:16 - maybe i would leave this uh center
09:18 - aligns just again because it's kind of a
09:20 - stylistic um you know like starting
09:23 - point
09:24 - but yeah that's just kind of personal
09:25 - preference
09:26 - uh let's see then you also have my work
09:32 - cool
09:33 - click on both of those
09:34 - um okay and the sections will work in
09:37 - progress so i'm not gonna um
09:40 - you know really dig too deeply into that
09:42 - i imagine you're probably going to have
09:43 - like a couple of
09:44 - uh twitter like cards or you know like a
09:47 - couple of blocks here for
09:49 - your different projects so that's cool
09:52 - um
09:54 - okay and these are a couple of projects
09:56 - that you just created that i'm checking
09:58 - out
09:59 - um okay so yeah i imagine you'd probably
10:02 - use something like that down here
10:05 - i love this really nice drop shadow on
10:07 - these items
10:11 - and same thing with this
10:13 - okay so you develop some some decent uis
10:16 - and overall your user experience is
10:19 - really good
10:21 - biggest thing honestly that i can see is
10:23 - just the the text throughout other than
10:25 - that it's a great portfolio good use of
10:28 - color good use
10:29 - fonts and
10:31 - good use of color contrast and overall
10:34 - layout
10:35 - all right so let's bring this up okay
10:37 - and i think this is just a
10:39 - a one pager so it's just going to bring
10:40 - you to each section i love that
10:42 - animation by the way
10:45 - okay that just brings that up
10:47 - and of course we have contact cool
10:50 - i'm gonna just go ahead and hit f12 on
10:52 - my keyboard ensure that this is set to
10:55 - uh iphone and just scroll back up to the
10:58 - top
10:59 - cool and it looks like it is a mobile
11:01 - first design
11:02 - um
11:05 - yep everything looks consistent here
11:08 - uh you probably did mobile first so i
11:09 - can see why you would want to center
11:11 - align that
11:12 - um
11:14 - but i would probably still go with left
11:16 - aligned on that
11:17 - uh
11:20 - now skill set this is definitely where
11:21 - it would come i think in handy to have
11:23 - like i said one of the two sentences and
11:25 - then kind of separate out some of your
11:27 - skills into icons or something of that
11:30 - nature just so it's not like a huge wall
11:32 - of text i know
11:34 - on desktop not only desktop but on
11:36 - mobile when i'm scrolling through things
11:38 - i don't want to have to read a giant
11:40 - wall of text uh same thing with that
11:44 - but again overall great job
11:46 - um
11:47 - [Music]
11:48 - cool well hey nice job man i
11:51 - uh really appreciate you sharing this
11:53 - portfolio with me i'm just going to go
11:55 - ahead and hit f12 again
11:57 - and to add a little bit more value to
11:59 - you because this is only running at
12:00 - about 12 minutes it's going to bring up
12:03 - a couple of your social profiles
12:05 - probably won't
12:07 - uh take a look at facebook just because
12:08 - i don't have a facebook account
12:11 - uh
12:11 - [Music]
12:14 - come on twitter
12:18 - cool looks like you're doing uh you know
12:20 - decent social social engagement you're
12:23 - posting things that
12:25 - are you know good saying so that's a
12:26 - great way to market yourself
12:29 - um
12:32 - i think for these one thing that i would
12:34 - do though is look for relevant hashtags
12:37 - that you can start using because that's
12:40 - really going to help you get additional
12:42 - exposure exposure excuse me for each one
12:44 - of these so
12:46 - see for example you you paste or excuse
12:48 - me post something like this on a monday
12:51 - i believe the 31st was on monday let me
12:53 - see
12:54 - yep
12:56 - excuse me so you could do
12:58 - something like motivation monday on that
13:00 - or um
13:02 - let's see today was wednesday so you
13:04 - could do like a wednesday wisdom
13:07 - on
13:08 - some of these other posts
13:10 - in addition to you know a bunch of other
13:12 - things like maybe quotes hashtag quote
13:14 - or what have you
13:16 - and um that'll help get you a little bit
13:18 - more exposure on twitter
13:21 - you typically want to strike a balance
13:23 - between the amount of hashtags and
13:26 - the the overall
13:27 - the size the content that you have but
13:29 - since these are images you can pretty
13:32 - much get away with using i would say
13:34 - close to 10 hashtags and it wouldn't
13:36 - really look too spammy
13:38 - just because the content is large again
13:40 - if you were just doing pretty much plain
13:42 - text without an image or
13:44 - you know doing like a video that only
13:46 - has like a little
13:47 - display link on it and then you would
13:49 - want to kind of shorten the amount of
13:50 - hashtags you use to
13:52 - uh something more conservative i would
13:54 - say like four maybe five just as a rule
13:57 - of thumb
13:58 - but uh yeah overall looks like you're
14:01 - retweeting people engaging and this is
14:03 - just kind of a surface level analysis
14:05 - but um
14:07 - yeah so far it looks pretty good
14:09 - so let me go ahead and pop over to
14:13 - your linkedin okay um
14:17 - would definitely recommend connecting
14:18 - with more people
14:20 - um
14:22 - i would definitely recommend using a
14:24 - personalized photo
14:26 - um
14:27 - and not listing
14:28 - unemployed um
14:30 - maybe a list uh freelancer or
14:33 - apprentice or something of that nature
14:35 - just showing that you're making progress
14:37 - um on whatever you're interested in in
14:40 - pursuing
14:41 - um now in terms of you know like
14:43 - self-taught
14:44 - um
14:45 - again i would probably elaborate on that
14:47 - you know if you've done things like free
14:49 - code camp or codecademy go ahead and
14:51 - list those they actually do have those
14:53 - as educational institutions on linkedin
14:56 - um
14:57 - and now
14:59 - perhaps i'm not being i'm not able to
15:01 - see your whole profile
15:03 - uh just because of some of the settings
15:05 - that you have because we're not
15:06 - connected on linkedin so that is a
15:08 - possibility as well
15:10 - um
15:11 - but yeah i would definitely recommend if
15:13 - you haven't done it to
15:15 - again set those institutions um
15:20 - maybe put in some volunteer work uh put
15:22 - in some other projects that you've
15:23 - worked on
15:24 - uh perhaps start writing some blog posts
15:27 - or articles that you can include in here
15:29 - and also include uh you know what you've
15:32 - been working on uh because you would
15:34 - mention that you're doing full stack
15:35 - rails and react um which is fantastic i
15:39 - mean if you've been doing that then
15:40 - definitely include some projects and
15:42 - uh some of those additional tools that i
15:44 - saw on your portfolio site in here um
15:47 - while linkedin isn't the best to land a
15:49 - job directly with someone it is
15:51 - fantastic to connect you with recruiters
15:54 - you know that's typically how i would
15:55 - say i probably get
15:57 - uh maybe a fifth of my job requests it's
16:00 - just through linkedin
16:01 - you know technical recruiters through
16:03 - linkedin so just a consideration but not
16:05 - something you have to focus on but um
16:08 - yeah i just want to say it was a
16:09 - pleasure thanks again for sharing your
16:12 - portfolio with me i'm excited to have
16:15 - the opportunity and um if you're
16:17 - watching and you like this video and
16:19 - you'd like a portfolio or resume review
16:21 - please feel free to check out the link
16:23 - in the description would be happy to
16:24 - provide that to you for free with the
16:26 - little uh
16:27 - caveat of uh you know i'm able to post
16:30 - it on my youtube channel i'm able to
16:32 - repost it on
16:33 - free code camp and other
16:36 - code instructional youtube channels as
16:39 - well just so i can provide more value to
16:40 - people
16:42 - but i also do have a private option if
16:44 - you want to go ahead and do that i can
16:46 - do it privately for you however i do
16:48 - charge for that
16:49 - well once again this is benjamin's back
