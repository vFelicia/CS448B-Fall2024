02:11 - [Music]
02:13 - hi everyone
02:15 - welcome back to another vjs stream on
02:18 - free code camp
02:19 - hi sassy it's good to see you again hi
02:22 - tom
02:23 - so today is a continuation of
02:27 - the last app basically last week's app
02:31 - which was this view nwjs hours tracking
02:34 - app
02:36 - and
02:37 - i'm going to post this in the chat i
02:38 - think it's in the description below too
02:42 - let me
02:43 - oops there we go
02:46 - all right
02:47 - so
02:48 - i was basically building this
02:51 - application to track hours in
02:54 - vue.js so
02:56 - you can still watch the last stream and
02:58 - you can also read the readme here
02:59 - there's some more details about it
03:02 - so basically i made a couple screens
03:05 - last week
03:06 - um
03:07 - got the
03:08 - front a lot of the front end
03:10 - started anyway
03:12 - and so today i would like to
03:15 - be able to set up
03:17 - some kind of a database solution
03:19 - and then finish setting up some more of
03:22 - the screens in the application
03:25 - and just real quick i looked through
03:27 - quite a few
03:29 - solutions that people use for databases
03:32 - for desktop apps over the last few days
03:35 - and it's quite different because i'm so
03:38 - used to
03:39 - you know
03:40 - attaching the database to a backend and
03:43 - from the front end calling an api
03:46 - or even doing a full stack
03:48 - application together like a django app
03:51 - but there's a distinct front end and
03:53 - back end but in desktop apps it seems
03:56 - like it's recommended
03:58 - to just call called
03:59 - because it's all compiled into an
04:01 - application anyway so
04:03 - um i don't have to differentiate between
04:05 - the front and back end as much it's okay
04:07 - to
04:08 - i guess call the database from the front
04:10 - end
04:11 - and so out of all the options pouchdb
04:14 - looked really good so this is the one
04:17 - i'm gonna work with today for the
04:19 - application
04:21 - i also set up this is uh comes from
04:24 - couchdb
04:26 - so i
04:28 - set up couchdb earlier just to check it
04:31 - out because i hadn't used couchdb before
04:33 - but i used dynamo and and a couple
04:35 - other i would say similar
04:37 - databases
04:39 - yeah so um
04:42 - that was the starter for this app
04:45 - so i have the code open
04:48 - and
04:49 - i'm going to go ahead and run the code
04:52 - with the npm
04:55 - start command
04:58 - and this should open my browser window
05:02 - for the nwjs application
05:14 - all right cool
05:17 - so this is what i did last time
05:22 - this is all in bootstrap by the way
05:26 - and
05:27 - i have this page is the hours log and
05:29 - then i have a projects page
05:32 - uh there's no canada project that was
05:34 - just the default
05:36 - from this drop down component that i
05:37 - added
05:38 - oh add new project isn't set up yet but
05:40 - i do have this ad entry for the hours
05:43 - log
05:44 - where you can add a new hours entry
05:48 - um so i think i'm going to start off
05:51 - trying to
05:55 - for this hours log i'm going to start
05:57 - off trying to save this in a database
05:59 - and figuring that part out
06:02 - so
06:03 - i'm going to come to
06:05 - pouch db
06:08 - skip bower
06:10 - um
06:11 - okay so npm
06:14 - i'm not going to use the node because i
06:15 - can just use it directly for my view app
06:17 - here
06:19 - so i'm gonna go ahead and install
06:21 - pouchdb
06:26 - um oh right i have to stop it anyway
06:29 - oh well
06:30 - so let me get this installed on first
06:37 - okay
06:39 - and then just in my html
06:42 - i can
06:44 - require
06:47 - db and i shouldn't have to do anything
06:49 - else
06:55 - okay and then i'll have to set up the
06:57 - database so i guess i'm going to do this
06:59 - in my main.js file in the view
07:02 - application
07:05 - that's still installing
07:08 - can everyone hear me okay
07:14 - um oh let's see
07:18 - source so in my main js file
07:22 - um
07:24 - oh here's the public so here's my
07:26 - index.html file
07:29 - which is
07:33 - let's see build files will be
07:35 - auto-injected so i can add this
07:38 - in the header okay cool
07:41 - hi oliver i think this is the first time
07:43 - i've seen you here welcome to the stream
07:46 - so let me just add the
07:49 - db here
07:51 - in the head tag
07:54 - above anything that's going to be
07:55 - injected
07:57 - and above the view app
08:00 - um okay
08:03 - so
08:06 - now it says working with local databases
08:09 - to create local database you can simply
08:11 - call new patchdb and give it a name
08:14 - so
08:15 - this is what i'm going to do
08:18 - rdb equals new
08:21 - pouchdb
08:23 - and i think i'll put that in my main js
08:26 - file for right now
08:28 - and then i can separate it
08:30 - later
08:32 - so
08:34 - i'll say pouch db config
08:37 - let me zoom in one
08:42 - where's the drag
08:45 - there it is
08:46 - okay
08:47 - pouch
08:48 - db
08:50 - config
08:56 - okay
08:57 - so this is my new db i won't call it
09:00 - kittens though
09:01 - i'll call it
09:03 - hours
09:05 - for
09:07 - hours
09:09 - tracking
09:12 - let me do this
09:14 - camel case
09:16 - okay so i have a new db instance
09:19 - and then
09:21 - [Music]
09:22 - okay it says live code example pro tip
09:25 - whenever you see this live example in
09:27 - the guide you can download it just to
09:29 - follow along at home for example
09:31 - to run this app
09:33 - okay
09:34 - i don't want to do that
09:37 - how to
09:39 - oh remote databases
09:42 - and give it a path to a database in
09:44 - couchdb
09:46 - i don't think i want to do that although
09:47 - i do have couchdb running right now just
09:49 - in case
09:53 - get basic info
09:55 - about the database
10:00 - working with databases
10:03 - okay and then oh interesting so i can
10:08 - um
10:10 - all right let me run my app i think
10:13 - with the dev tools
10:15 - oh npm start i think i'll be able to
10:19 - navigate through this database using the
10:23 - in browser dev tools
10:30 - the same ones i use in chrome or firefox
10:34 - okay
10:35 - so that's loading let me
10:37 - try to open
10:40 - the
10:45 - dev tools
10:47 - let's see
10:49 - inspect
10:53 - so
10:56 - okay not in source
10:58 - let's see
11:00 - is it in i can't remember which one
11:04 - application
11:06 - sources
11:08 - why am i i'm having a brain fart right
11:10 - now i can't remember
11:11 - yeah here it is
11:12 - application all right
11:14 - so
11:16 - indexeddb
11:19 - um i'm not using index db
11:22 - cache storage application cache local
11:25 - storage
11:28 - um
11:29 - okay i thought maybe it would be in here
11:31 - but i guess i need to read a little bit
11:32 - more
11:35 - let's see
11:36 - indexeddb web sql inspectors you can use
11:39 - the normal developer tools to see what
11:41 - your database looks like under the hood
11:44 - in chrome just choose the
11:46 - overflow icon
11:50 - tools developer tools then click on
11:52 - resources tab then
11:54 - indexeddb okay
11:59 - tools developer tools
12:02 - all right so
12:07 - oh these are the developer tools
12:10 - resources tab
12:13 - do i have a resources tab
12:19 - um
12:20 - more tools
12:25 - yeah i don't see it okay
12:27 - i mean index db is here anyway so this
12:30 - is probably what they're talking about
12:34 - but
12:37 - yeah i don't see it there so maybe it
12:39 - just hasn't added the database yet
12:44 - so
12:45 - okay
12:48 - um
12:49 - so i have
12:50 - this which is a new db
12:53 - hours tracking
12:56 - and
12:58 - seems to be doing okay
13:01 - yeah there's nothing to add right now so
13:03 - how do i add a table
13:06 - or a collection to the database
13:10 - um
13:12 - you can also enable
13:14 - debug logging
13:16 - oh wait what am i doing i'm not
13:17 - importing pouchdb from oh yeah i am it's
13:20 - in my index.html file okay nevermind so
13:23 - i have my pouchdb database
13:27 - and so i should be able to
13:30 - let me enable
13:32 - the debug mode
13:34 - put that here
13:38 - okay
13:40 - delete your local database
13:45 - in chrome you can use clear cache all
13:47 - right
13:49 - um
13:51 - debug mode i wonder if it's in working
13:53 - with
13:55 - documents
13:57 - so patchdb is a nosql database yeah
14:04 - okay
14:06 - so to store a document you simply
14:09 - use put
14:12 - um
14:14 - okay
14:15 - so
14:18 - db.get
14:20 - mittens okay so there i think there is
14:22 - no concept of tables
14:25 - in this database
14:26 - it's just
14:28 - put the documents
14:32 - and then retrieve them by the id okay
14:35 - well
14:37 - um
14:40 - this is interesting
14:45 - okay
14:46 - i think what i'm going to do first then
14:50 - is finish up some of these pages
14:53 - just so i can get going with this
14:57 - and then work on putting things in the
14:59 - database
15:00 - so i think i'm going to pick back up on
15:03 - the
15:04 - projects page
15:05 - where i was here
15:07 - and make it so you can add a project
15:09 - because i'm going to need a foreign key
15:11 - relation between
15:13 - these projects and which hours or which
15:17 - project certain hours go to
15:20 - so i think i'm going to finish setting
15:22 - up that so select projects
15:25 - i need
15:26 - an add new project page
15:29 - which will match
15:31 - this schema here so i'll need a name
15:33 - description
15:34 - color
15:35 - and then
15:37 - create it at updated should be automatic
15:40 - so i need a name description and a color
15:42 - for the project
15:45 - so
15:46 - the first thing i need to do is create a
15:48 - view for that
15:50 - get out of here
15:52 - in my source
15:55 - so i have app
15:59 - which is oh wait this is the
16:03 - wait one second
16:07 - i think that was a different
16:09 - let me open this in the code editor make
16:10 - sure that's the right app
16:14 - there we go
16:17 - all right
16:18 - so yeah i was wondering where my views
16:20 - folder was okay so here's the projects
16:24 - page
16:25 - that i have
16:27 - and
16:28 - i have the time entry page which is the
16:30 - form
16:31 - for
16:33 - entering new hours so i'm going to copy
16:35 - that
16:36 - and i'll go to views
16:39 - and
16:40 - now i'm going to
16:41 - put i guess project entry page
16:45 - since i'm calling the other one time
16:46 - entry
16:48 - and i'm going to paste this
16:50 - let's see what i need to change
16:53 - not time entry but
16:56 - project entry
17:00 - and
17:02 - okay i don't need date pickers for this
17:08 - and okay i have submit and reset buttons
17:10 - so i need to grab form elements for this
17:13 - oh and let me change the page name
17:16 - to project
17:17 - entry
17:19 - uh
17:20 - start date end date
17:24 - okay so i have
17:26 - a basic boilerplate for it
17:28 - um oh yeah let me add it to the router
17:30 - real quick so i can wrap to that page
17:33 - add time entry so let me copy
17:36 - this
17:39 - go to the end
17:42 - and this one will be add
17:45 - project
17:56 - project entry okay
17:58 - now i need to import this
18:00 - at the top
18:02 - um
18:08 - project
18:12 - entry project entry okay
18:17 - so now i have it routable so let me
18:21 - go to
18:23 - my
18:24 - hours log
18:26 - or not my hours log
18:28 - um
18:30 - okay in my app
18:34 - no actually it's from the projects page
18:36 - it's not from the main bar so this here
18:39 - this add new project
18:41 - so
18:43 - let me just create a link from here
18:48 - and
18:49 - say
18:51 - at click
18:53 - and then i'm going to use the view
18:54 - router so
18:56 - dollar sign router
18:58 - dot push
19:00 - and then
19:01 - whatever
19:02 - route
19:04 - so
19:05 - actually i could do based off the name
19:07 - so i could do name
19:09 - is
19:10 - project entry
19:13 - let's see if that works
19:17 - oh i need to run it again so
19:20 - npm
19:22 - start and that'll take a minute
19:28 - okay
19:31 - so now project entry is routable
19:35 - and then yeah the database is really the
19:37 - next thing because i need to be able to
19:39 - add
19:40 - these hours and projects in here
19:43 - so from the hours log
19:46 - if i add an entry
19:49 - from here okay cool
19:52 - i can add a project entry let me just
19:55 - add those fields real quick and then
19:56 - i'll get back to the database so name
19:58 - description and color
20:00 - and
20:03 - from
20:03 - [Music]
20:05 - okay from here
20:07 - i have these label start date so this is
20:09 - going to be
20:11 - name
20:13 - and then
20:17 - add description
20:21 - and then
20:24 - i'll add
20:26 - color
20:28 - and
20:29 - i'm using vidif not beautify this is
20:31 - bootstrap
20:35 - okay let me look up bootstrap view then
20:37 - for the forum elements
20:39 - bootstrap
20:41 - view
20:44 - here we go
20:49 - okay uh get oh docs here we go
20:53 - so let me look for form
20:58 - and i think just all the form components
21:01 - are on one page here
21:03 - so
21:05 - where is the code here it is
21:07 - so this b form
21:09 - b form group b form input
21:11 - so this is what i want
21:14 - b form input
21:17 - and then
21:18 - so the first two name and description
21:20 - are these inputs
21:26 - let's see
21:30 - this one will be
21:31 - type of text
21:33 - which is default so i don't think i need
21:35 - it there required placeholder
21:39 - is name
21:42 - and
21:43 - v model
21:45 - is form data and then i'll put name
21:48 - which i don't have there yet so name
21:52 - id
21:53 - is okay
21:54 - and now let me just copy this
21:57 - actually i'll probably want a text area
22:01 - so
22:02 - let me search for that
22:04 - form text area
22:08 - yeah let me copy this one
22:11 - it's a form text area
22:17 - okay
22:18 - b form input
22:20 - now i have text area
22:23 - i think this is actually zoomed in too
22:24 - much
22:25 - maybe yeah that's better
22:28 - it was sideways scrolling a lot
22:32 - okay
22:36 - so the model
22:39 - is
22:40 - is it form data dot description
22:45 - and then i'll say enter
22:47 - a description
22:49 - for the placeholder
22:52 - three to six rows that's fine
22:56 - um
22:57 - and then
23:03 - oh yeah i'm not closing it that's why
23:05 - it was giving me an
23:06 - error
23:08 - okay cool that looks good i wonder if
23:10 - you can resize things
23:13 - oh not really in this that's fine so i
23:15 - have a name description and then i need
23:18 - a color picker
23:19 - so let me look for
23:23 - color picker i wonder if they have one
23:27 - they have bar color schemes
23:31 - color picker
23:37 - those date pickers
23:40 - oh here's color picker it's a third
23:41 - party library i guess
23:43 - view color picker v color
23:45 - vert
23:50 - view color picker
23:56 - do i want to add a whole color picker
24:02 - um
24:06 - yeah it looks pretty easy to use let me
24:08 - look at the other ones
24:12 - oh you can zoom panes independently
24:15 - in vs code i didn't know about that
24:19 - um
24:21 - pretty sure
24:23 - there's an html
24:25 - native color picker
24:28 - um is there html
24:32 - an html color picker oh wait
24:36 - color
24:37 - picker
24:42 - type color oh
24:46 - it only works in modern browsers well
24:49 - good thing this is latest version of
24:52 - chromium
24:55 - um
24:58 - okay
24:59 - color picker
25:04 - let's see
25:08 - actually i don't need the name
25:10 - because
25:11 - i'm gonna remodel this so
25:14 - i guess i can do
25:17 - v model
25:18 - is
25:21 - form
25:22 - data dot color
25:25 - type
25:26 - color
25:28 - oh cool thank you
25:30 - i didn't even know
25:31 - i didn't even know html had one and that
25:34 - looks just as good as
25:35 - any other one except i can change the
25:38 - style a little bit of how it's displayed
25:42 - thank you
25:43 - okay let me just put these in my data
25:45 - real quick
25:47 - so i need
25:49 - name
25:52 - description
25:55 - and then color
25:58 - which
26:01 - i guess it's a string
26:04 - i'm not sure
26:05 - um
26:09 - let's see
26:12 - let me actually see what it is let me
26:14 - open up the dev tools
26:16 - inspect
26:19 - and
26:21 - i think i have view yeah i have the view
26:22 - dev tools here
26:25 - so
26:26 - let me look at
26:29 - um
26:31 - let's see project entry
26:34 - yeah cool i have the color there
26:37 - thank you that was easy
26:39 - all right so now i have project entry
26:42 - page
26:43 - and the hours log and
26:45 - add new time entry page so now i really
26:48 - need to hook this up to the database
26:50 - and
26:51 - i think my mind just being so used to
26:54 - let me get rid of these um
26:57 - you know having it connected to a back
26:59 - end
27:00 - it's
27:01 - it's kind of strange to
27:03 - i guess
27:04 - imagine this database or imagine how to
27:07 - use it
27:11 - okay so
27:12 - related api documentation there's get
27:16 - and there's put and i'm guessing get
27:18 - because i'm gonna need to get back
27:24 - or query for a whole bunch of objects of
27:27 - the same yeah you did thank you
27:32 - i'm going to need to query for a whole
27:34 - bunch of objects
27:35 - of the same type
27:38 - so i guess i can pass in options
27:42 - let me look at their examples
27:44 - so they have db.get
27:50 - my doctor okay let's stop then
27:52 - um but that's just searching by id how
27:54 - can i pull things back without using the
27:56 - id
28:00 - okay create update a batch of documents
28:03 - that's good
28:05 - okay db.bulk docs
28:09 - so i i'd have to create a different
28:11 - database for
28:13 - i think i need one database for projects
28:15 - and one database for
28:18 - [Music]
28:20 - users with this
28:22 - with pouchdb
28:28 - okay
28:29 - bulk update delete
28:31 - what about bulk get oh fetch a batch of
28:34 - documents
28:36 - db all docs
28:38 - fetch multiple documents indexed and
28:40 - sorted
28:42 - by the id
28:45 - uh deleted documents are only included
28:47 - if option.keys is specified okay
28:50 - so
28:51 - i basically
28:54 - need to set up two databases
28:58 - oh
28:59 - i was wondering why the database didn't
29:01 - show up it's because i put it in the
29:02 - wrong application that was that was dumb
29:06 - um
29:07 - okay so here i'm actually going to have
29:09 - to
29:12 - um
29:15 - go back i think it's working with
29:17 - databases yeah
29:19 - i need this
29:20 - and then i need to set up the debug too
29:24 - so i have
29:26 - all of these imports
29:29 - all of those okay i'm going to set up
29:34 - database config
29:38 - here and
29:41 - two databases and then i need to set up
29:47 - the
29:47 - debug options
29:50 - you can also enable debug logging by
29:53 - doing
29:55 - this
29:55 - i want logging because i want to make
29:57 - sure that it's working
30:04 - okay so
30:06 - kittens
30:07 - what other
30:08 - so these are i think it the concept of
30:10 - db here is like a table
30:13 - so
30:14 - i'm gonna do
30:16 - time
30:17 - entry
30:19 - and then
30:23 - was the other one projects
30:27 - or this would be time entries
30:31 - and
30:35 - let's see
30:36 - deleting your local database differences
30:38 - between local and remote okay
30:42 - and now
30:45 - oh i'm not actually importing this in
30:47 - this app
30:48 - into the index.js
30:51 - so let me go into public
30:54 - go to
30:55 - index.html i mean
30:58 - and then i need to paste the link there
31:02 - which is setting up pouchdb
31:08 - i already installed it so i just need to
31:09 - add this link to the head tag
31:15 - oh hi jared good to see you
31:19 - too bad you're here not here to help me
31:21 - with nwjs
31:24 - okay
31:25 - so
31:27 - let's see script tag pouch cb
31:31 - and
31:32 - i think that's it let me rerun the
31:34 - server because i'm guessing i'll need to
31:36 - rerun it
31:37 - so it can see that import in the
31:40 - index.html
31:53 - all right
31:55 - now it's going to reopen the window
32:02 - uh maybe there's an error i don't know
32:06 - let's see
32:08 - pouchdb is not defined
32:11 - okay
32:14 - um
32:17 - so i have it here
32:20 - um because i thought that it would
32:22 - expose oh not enough in that file
32:25 - from here
32:27 - i thought that it would expose
32:31 - that pouch db variable for me to use
32:36 - but i guess it's not doing that
32:41 - so i could
32:43 - i guess i could do it just directly npm
32:45 - install it
32:48 - wait someone sent me a message
32:53 - uh nw dot window dot
32:59 - okay
33:01 - just to automate the devtools opening
33:04 - sure let me add that
33:06 - thanks for the tip
33:08 - um
33:09 - let me add this to
33:12 - i guess just anywhere
33:14 - for right now
33:16 - um i'll have to take that out before i
33:19 - build this as an app
33:23 - okay
33:25 - so i guess next time i next time i run
33:27 - my server it should automatically open
33:29 - the devtools
33:33 - the first line
33:35 - of js and then comment it out okay
33:37 - pouchdb is not defined
33:41 - so
33:44 - let me actually take this out i'm gonna
33:46 - try
33:48 - oh it did restart
33:49 - patch tv is still not fun i know let me
33:52 - actually install it just like i would
33:54 - any other view module here
33:58 - and
34:01 - uh
34:02 - let's see mpm and
34:04 - oops i copied npm install okay npm
34:08 - install pouchdb
34:23 - and it's taking a minute
34:30 - yeah that'll just be easier if i can
34:32 - import it
34:37 - in view
34:40 - okay
34:41 - yeah i don't know why i didn't do that
34:43 - before
34:44 - now let me do npm start
34:47 - and while that's going
34:50 - i'll come to my main js and
34:53 - i'm gonna
34:56 - put that with my library imports
34:59 - 08
35:01 - require i wonder if i can import this
35:03 - then
35:05 - um
35:08 - db
35:09 - uh import
35:11 - pouch db
35:13 - i'll see if this works
35:17 - from
35:19 - pouch db
35:24 - cannot read enable
35:26 - of undefined
35:31 - in
35:33 - my
35:35 - source main js
35:40 - oh
35:43 - dot pouchdb.debug.in
35:49 - okay
35:52 - so i wonder if it's even registering
35:55 - pouch db
35:57 - because i don't seem to have the debug
35:59 - enable available so let me look in
36:01 - application
36:05 - oh cool i do have it
36:07 - awesome so i do have
36:10 - if you can see on the side there i have
36:12 - pouchdb
36:15 - projects and patchdb time entries
36:21 - and then i can open those up
36:24 - and
36:26 - um
36:29 - i can look at
36:31 - all the different
36:34 - i don't know i'm not too familiar with
36:35 - um
36:37 - the index to db in the browser
36:40 - so yeah i'll have to try that out
36:43 - okay but anyway i do have my two
36:49 - databases here that i added that's good
36:52 - so i should be able to start
36:54 - adding
36:57 - things to them
36:59 - so how do i do
37:04 - let's see
37:05 - i can do
37:08 - create update doc create database delete
37:11 - yeah let me go to create or update so
37:13 - it's just db.put
37:16 - and then
37:18 - um
37:18 - [Music]
37:21 - i need the
37:24 - doc okay
37:26 - um so here
37:28 - i have
37:30 - the two dbs here
37:32 - i have time entries and projects
37:36 - the thing is though i'm wondering if i
37:40 - should put it here now i'm thinking that
37:42 - maybe i want this
37:44 - in my view x or in an extra config that
37:47 - i import into my view x
37:50 - because
37:53 - this is really where i'm going to be
37:54 - working
37:56 - with
37:56 - that
37:58 - db stuff
38:00 - so
38:02 - let's see
38:05 - let me make not in my router
38:07 - in my store let me make a new file
38:10 - and
38:11 - i'm going to call it db
38:13 - config
38:15 - dot js
38:19 - and then i'm going to take
38:22 - pouch db
38:25 - uh take it here
38:28 - is this a good idea does anyone else
38:30 - have a better idea
38:31 - set it up in my view x
38:34 - and then
38:37 - i'm going to take
38:39 - these
38:41 - because otherwise
38:43 - i mean could i inject it into
38:45 - my global state but then i want to use
38:47 - it from view x
38:48 - so i need access to those databases from
38:52 - here anyway
38:53 - oh wait
38:54 - i made this new file let me use that new
38:56 - file
38:58 - um
39:00 - okay
39:03 - so let me use that file and then let me
39:07 - import
39:09 - import db
39:13 - config
39:14 - from
39:17 - db config
39:21 - okay
39:22 - and now i need to
39:26 - um export oh wait this is these are both
39:29 - the bees why am i doing two dbs so let
39:31 - me export these as two different things
39:34 - i'm gonna do
39:36 - um
39:39 - t e
39:41 - db
39:43 - no i need to spell this out so time
39:45 - entry
39:46 - db
39:48 - and
39:49 - i'll call this
39:52 - projects
39:53 - db and actually that should be time
39:56 - entries
40:00 - okay and then from here i need to export
40:02 - something
40:03 - so i need to export
40:08 - export um
40:12 - yeah i was thinking i could export these
40:14 - individually
40:16 - but i want to export an object because
40:18 - then i can
40:19 - add options or do whatever i want
40:22 - so let me export
40:25 - default in object
40:28 - and i'll do time
40:30 - entries
40:31 - eb
40:33 - and then i'll do
40:35 - projects db
40:43 - okay
40:44 - um
40:48 - oh it has the option to refresh that's
40:50 - cool
40:52 - okay so now i have these two database
40:55 - instances and i can pull these out
40:59 - so
41:00 - when i import them into view x
41:02 - i can just go ahead and get time entries
41:05 - and projects
41:07 - db
41:09 - and then i can do whatever i want with
41:10 - them in my view x store
41:13 - and then i can interact with the
41:15 - database from any component through the
41:16 - store
41:20 - okay
41:22 - um so i think i think that will work
41:24 - and now let me do db.put
41:28 - doc options callback
41:32 - um
41:33 - so let me grab this
41:35 - and let me just do a test here
41:37 - so
41:39 - let me do
41:44 - um
41:46 - okay so doc i need
41:50 - name
41:51 - gwen
41:53 - and then
41:55 - options
41:58 - uh
41:59 - options i'll just leave an empty object
42:01 - for that
42:03 - and then callback
42:05 - function
42:10 - um this will be just console.log
42:15 - worked
42:16 - even though there's no
42:18 - error handling
42:24 - all right
42:26 - so how do i see documents that i've
42:28 - added which one did i add to
42:30 - oh i don't even have db there
42:33 - let me add this to time entries oh no
42:36 - projects
42:38 - projects db
42:46 - um export projects db was not found in
42:49 - db config okay
42:54 - exports
42:55 - projects
42:57 - db
42:58 - okay
43:00 - so
43:04 - let's see
43:07 - projects db did i misspell something
43:10 - i think i misspelled something
43:14 - did i
43:22 - oh it seems to be right projects db
43:27 - let me restart the server and see
43:35 - okay these are both new pouchdb
43:39 - projects dp
43:46 - okay export project stevie was not found
43:50 - in db
43:52 - config learning from source store
43:55 - index.js
43:58 - hmm
44:01 - that's weird okay
44:04 - let me look at index.js
44:08 - see if i'm importing the right file so i
44:10 - do have
44:12 - db config
44:14 - which is that file name
44:16 - and then i'm importing
44:18 - let me try time entries
44:24 - yeah why why aren't the exports being
44:26 - found in here
44:29 - i'm exporting default oh because i'm
44:31 - requiring this maybe
44:34 - um
44:37 - maybe i need to import
44:40 - let's see
44:43 - import
44:45 - from i think this i feel like that's
44:47 - what i was doing anyway in
44:50 - the main.js file
44:59 - no i thought i had it here where i
45:00 - changed it to import maybe i didn't i
45:02 - can't remember
45:05 - okay
45:06 - it was not found
45:08 - in
45:13 - let's see
45:15 - it wasn't found in
45:18 - the dbconfig file so let me actually see
45:22 - because this is creating the new
45:28 - pouchdb
45:30 - instances and i am exporting
45:35 - the correct
45:36 - um
45:37 - values from there
45:40 - so that's a little bit strange let me
45:43 - see
45:46 - um time entries projects db
45:49 - exports
45:51 - um let me see what these are equal to
45:56 - from here
45:57 - so
46:01 - let me try to get it to pause
46:04 - on the debugger
46:07 - okay so
46:09 - um
46:11 - entries db
46:13 - these are both correct and pouch db
46:16 - those are both correct
46:19 - and then what i'm exporting is also
46:21 - correct
46:25 - which is strange
46:27 - okay
46:30 - but then when i'm importing it so the
46:32 - problem is when i'm importing it here
46:35 - and i can do
46:36 - a
46:39 - debugger here
46:44 - that should restart on its own
46:46 - does anyone have an idea about why this
46:48 - isn't working
46:52 - let's see
46:55 - it's restarting
46:57 - cannot read property line number of
46:59 - undefined
47:09 - okay let me play it
47:12 - and
47:15 - maybe i'll restart the server again
47:24 - and this should open the
47:27 - dev tools
47:29 - so it should open the new debugger i
47:31 - think
47:33 - because the devtools will open before
47:35 - the app
47:37 - finishes
47:41 - okay so i have my two index db's
47:47 - i'll refresh both of them
47:55 - console.log inside of export okay so
47:57 - here's the problem cannot read put of
47:59 - undefined
48:01 - um
48:02 - but these are defined
48:05 - console.log so
48:07 - inside of export um
48:10 - i looked at these in the debugger
48:14 - and
48:15 - when i had a debugger in here
48:18 - where is it get out of there
48:20 - in here
48:35 - let's see
48:36 - and
48:38 - it says that they're defined here
48:41 - or at least it shows time entries but it
48:43 - was saying
48:44 - in the other file that time entries and
48:46 - projects aren't defined
48:49 - which is weird i can make sure that this
48:52 - one
48:57 - yeah these are all spelled the same
49:01 - let me step over
49:03 - oh yeah
49:11 - try pudding okay let's
49:17 - try putting inside of
49:21 - try put inside of db config yeah i guess
49:25 - it will work from there maybe i'll just
49:26 - move it to this main file
49:31 - because it doesn't seem to like the
49:32 - importing exporting and that might
49:34 - because because it's only set up
49:38 - it's not set up to use
49:41 - es6 but i don't see how that would make
49:43 - sense
49:45 - because this import works
49:47 - yeah i don't know
49:48 - let me see
49:50 - oh wait
49:51 - did i
49:52 - let me
49:55 - get this back
49:59 - and now in here
50:03 - okay so time entries db.put
50:07 - and then let me see
50:08 - i got rid of all the debuggers so let me
50:10 - just play
50:15 - cannot read property put of undefined
50:18 - let me
50:21 - refresh this
50:24 - okay
50:26 - okay so that worked actually
50:28 - if i just have it in the same file yeah
50:30 - i don't know why the import export isn't
50:32 - working
50:36 - why do you need the curly brackets in
50:38 - import
50:40 - oh i was just pulling these two things
50:42 - out
50:44 - from the import
50:47 - so i didn't have to but then i would
50:49 - have to
50:51 - do like db dot this database or that
50:54 - database
50:55 - so i was just using a shorthand
50:59 - um
51:01 - okay
51:05 - maybe you should import yeah that's what
51:07 - i'm thinking that i'll just move this
51:09 - whole thing to import for right now
51:11 - because this seems to work i do wonder
51:14 - how i can see
51:16 - so that's time entries
51:18 - um
51:18 - [Music]
51:20 - attach store local store
51:25 - meta store
51:27 - this is metadata
51:30 - doc id
51:32 - sequence
51:34 - there's a lot of stuff in here
51:40 - so where is
51:44 - um
51:50 - i wonder do i have to
51:52 - refresh this database
51:56 - refresh
52:00 - because i can't see the dock i just
52:02 - added
52:05 - it's not listed here
52:08 - key blob
52:13 - detect blob support
52:15 - yeah i don't
52:16 - know where the document is
52:22 - i guess i don't know enough about this
52:24 - index.js
52:26 - to
52:27 - see it but it says it saved so let me
52:29 - just move this
52:31 - to the index file
52:36 - yeah
52:38 - and
52:40 - so
52:41 - um let's see
52:44 - get rid of that
52:46 - export default get rid of these
52:56 - okay
52:58 - and i wonder if i do have to set an id
53:00 - here
53:01 - so
53:03 - let's look at a document
53:05 - yeah they're putting the id so i do need
53:07 - to set my own id
53:10 - on these documents so i guess i'm going
53:11 - to use uuid
53:16 - let's see npm uuid
53:20 - to generate a unique id for each
53:22 - document since the database isn't doing
53:24 - it for me
53:27 - okay npm install
53:29 - uuid
53:34 - and then
53:36 - i'll import it into the view x
53:39 - okay one more time stopping the server
53:42 - oh clear
53:44 - um
53:45 - npm install uuid
53:50 - that should be pretty quick
53:52 - and then i can import
53:58 - um
53:58 - uid okay then i just call the uuid
54:01 - function
54:02 - so let me import this in my view x
54:06 - so
54:08 - after pouchdb
54:10 - i'll import
54:12 - um
54:14 - version 4 as uuid version 4.
54:17 - so i think this is how i need to
54:21 - store documents in here i need to add
54:23 - the database
54:25 - so i can call this uuid function that i
54:27 - just imported
54:30 - and save
54:31 - the id and name
54:33 - [Music]
54:35 - and i'm actually logging worked here
54:38 - so i think that's
54:40 - oops um
54:43 - oh wait that's also a mistake
54:47 - so
54:50 - let's see
54:55 - because this could come back
54:58 - with an error so
55:01 - um what would i get response and then
55:04 - error or error and then response
55:06 - let me look at this api
55:10 - uh
55:11 - okay so
55:13 - oh there's dot then dot catch after put
55:16 - so i could use async await for this
55:20 - and then try catch let me just copy this
55:22 - though
55:23 - for this test right here
55:25 - so
55:27 - i'm going to do this
55:29 - so i'm going to call that put
55:31 - and now i can
55:32 - use dot then
55:35 - indent all this
55:37 - all right
55:40 - hi pk get now how are you
55:44 - um okay so now i have error
55:47 - and i'll just console.log
55:51 - the response as well
55:59 - okay
55:59 - and let me see how it handles this
56:03 - when i run the app again
56:07 - npm start
56:11 - hi pk did you join to give me some
56:13 - advice
56:18 - um
56:22 - hopefully but if you want to chat that's
56:23 - good too
56:25 - um
56:26 - okay
56:29 - i like the dev tools opening
56:30 - automatically
56:40 - all right
56:46 - yay sweet look at this
56:48 - doc id
56:51 - rev
56:52 - whatever that means
56:55 - and i have
56:57 - the
56:58 - object
57:00 - with named gwen i have the
57:03 - unique id
57:04 - that i set
57:06 - primary key one cool
57:09 - okay so now i can see it in here that's
57:12 - good news
57:14 - and now
57:16 - i just need to put this in my
57:20 - um
57:21 - or add
57:22 - view x
57:24 - actions here
57:27 - oh sorry my watch is telling me to go
57:30 - walk around
57:31 - it says it reminds me when i've been
57:33 - sitting too long
57:35 - but i can't walk around right now
57:38 - um okay so actions what kind of actions
57:41 - do i need i need to i need crud
57:43 - operations
57:44 - for
57:45 - projects
57:47 - and for time entries
57:50 - so
57:50 - i'm gonna name these kind of like crud
57:53 - operations
57:54 - so let's say create time
57:58 - entry
58:00 - um
58:01 - these will all be async
58:03 - too
58:04 - so
58:07 - and then we do async
58:10 - create
58:11 - project
58:15 - and then
58:19 - in create time entry
58:21 - i'm gonna
58:23 - copy this
58:28 - uh
58:31 - wait oh yeah
58:34 - oh i missed the
58:36 - other part of the
58:38 - there we go
58:47 - so what i'm going to do inside of this
58:50 - async function
58:52 - is change this from promises to async
58:56 - await
58:58 - so
58:59 - i'm going to do const
59:02 - const response equals
59:05 - a weight
59:07 - whatever object i'm going to put in
59:09 - and actually here
59:11 - so
59:13 - the first
59:14 - parameter is
59:17 - um from vue.js so i'll be able to
59:21 - get
59:22 - the function to commit mutations and
59:24 - then the second one is what i'm passing
59:25 - in as the payload
59:27 - which will be
59:30 - in object here
59:32 - which will be this object
59:34 - that i'm gonna save
59:38 - um
59:40 - so let me get rid of this then
59:43 - and i'm gonna add
59:45 - the payload on here
59:47 - and i'm going to generate an id
59:50 - from view x for that payload i'm passing
59:52 - in that i want to save as a time entry
59:56 - um
59:57 - okay
59:59 - and then get rid of bees
60:04 - it keeps bringing me over there every
60:05 - time i save but it's such a habit to
60:08 - save
60:08 - every second
60:10 - um
60:12 - okay i feel much better about this now
60:15 - let's see
60:16 - um create time entry
60:19 - so this
60:21 - i need to wrap this in a try catch so i
60:23 - can know if
60:25 - this creates an error
60:30 - let me close that and then do catch
60:34 - let's see
60:36 - error
60:38 - and then i'll just do console.
60:41 - error
60:43 - and error
60:44 - and now
60:46 - okay in my try
60:48 - i need to so what do i want to do with
60:51 - the response
60:52 - um
60:57 - the response
61:01 - i don't know i guess for now i could
61:03 - just log it out i actually don't think i
61:05 - want
61:06 - um
61:09 - because this is all local
61:12 - so
61:13 - because in a nor so in a normal vjs
61:15 - application on the web
61:16 - i would take the document i just created
61:20 - and push it into my state so that i
61:23 - didn't have to make another api call
61:25 - but
61:27 - and actually that will make it update so
61:29 - let me just
61:30 - not do that for right now and see how
61:32 - this plays out so let me do console.log
61:34 - response
61:36 - um
61:38 - and that means it was a success so let
61:40 - me do
61:42 - i guess success
61:46 - okay and then i basically want the same
61:49 - thing for
61:53 - create project so i'm just going to go
61:55 - ahead and put that and then i'll make a
61:56 - getter because
61:58 - i need to be able to get all of this
62:01 - stuff out of the database
62:04 - so for project
62:06 - i want the same things
62:09 - i want i probably don't need to commit
62:11 - so i'll just leave that empty
62:13 - um i don't know if i can leave it empty
62:17 - um
62:18 - maybe i don't know uh payload is that
62:21 - gonna error
62:23 - and
62:28 - i wonder so okay so this is project
62:32 - projects db
62:38 - which is basically the same thing
62:41 - um
62:43 - generating uid
62:45 - passing the payload so i save all of the
62:48 - key value pairs on the payload
62:51 - and then so now i need to get all of the
62:54 - items that i save
62:58 - so let me make that real quick before i
63:00 - test out the saving because i need to be
63:02 - able to see if i
63:04 - created anything
63:06 - hi jared so i basically
63:09 - several things broke but i think they're
63:11 - fixed now
63:12 - i basically set up pouchdb from here
63:15 - because i couldn't get it working from
63:17 - importing
63:18 - in the
63:20 - index.html file
63:23 - and then
63:25 - i have to create my own ids so i
63:26 - imported uuid
63:29 - um yeah and then i have these two
63:31 - databases
63:33 - so patchdb seems to differentiate
63:36 - by databases instead of tables so i
63:39 - created two different databases for
63:40 - these two tables that i want
63:43 - and right now i'm working on these
63:44 - actions so that i can get
63:51 - uh
63:52 - get
63:53 - all the time entries
63:55 - and projects that are in the database
64:03 - line 18
64:05 - yeah i'm still typing that's why there's
64:08 - an error
64:11 - okay
64:14 - yeah
64:16 - let's see uh read time entries
64:20 - okay
64:21 - um i don't actually need to commit from
64:23 - there either really
64:26 - so let me do
64:28 - i don't need to pass in a payload i
64:30 - don't need anything
64:33 - um i just need to basically get
64:36 - which is
64:37 - oh bringing me back over there so i
64:40 - think that is
64:42 - bulk get or batch
64:44 - is it batch fetch
64:48 - oh indexes and everything okay
64:51 - um
64:53 - let's see batch fetch db.all docs
64:57 - okay
64:58 - so
65:01 - from here then i'll have to be able to
65:03 - filter at some point too
65:06 - which i guess options might let me
65:08 - filter
65:13 - i forgot to have water here
65:15 - i might need some in a second
65:17 - um
65:19 - okay so
65:20 - what was i getting oh yeah db.all docs
65:24 - so let me do that here so await
65:27 - db
65:28 - which will be
65:30 - time
65:32 - entries db dot
65:35 - all docs
65:37 - and then
65:38 - pass in options if i want options
65:42 - but
65:44 - i think i don't don't need options right
65:46 - now so let me
65:48 - do const
65:50 - docs
65:53 - equals that and let me just i guess i'll
65:55 - log out the docs because i don't know
65:56 - what format that's coming back in
66:01 - okay and now i need this action to
66:05 - be able to be called from my component
66:08 - which will be my
66:10 - hours log so i can see all the hours in
66:12 - here
66:14 - so let me go down here
66:16 - and i'm going to map it into the
66:18 - component so i'm going to import
66:22 - was it map actions
66:26 - from
66:26 - view x
66:29 - can you explain commit
66:32 - yeah so real quick commit
66:35 - here is
66:37 - um
66:38 - so
66:40 - view x has my global state or it will
66:42 - have global state
66:44 - whenever i need state that doesn't
66:45 - necessarily need to be in the database
66:48 - but i want it to be accessed by many
66:50 - components so what commit does is call a
66:53 - mutation
66:55 - that can update that global state
66:57 - but right now i don't have any mutations
67:01 - um or anything on the global state so i
67:03 - really don't need commit yet
67:05 - but it's generally from ux actions most
67:08 - viewers bux actions will call commit
67:11 - to update state but i'll get rid of that
67:15 - for right now so it's not
67:18 - yeah so it's not there when i don't need
67:19 - it
67:20 - um
67:24 - oh yeah
67:28 - uh okay so i am pulling in
67:32 - map actions
67:34 - and now i need so i need to put that in
67:36 - methods
67:38 - which will be below data so i need a
67:39 - methods
67:40 - object for view
67:43 - and then
67:47 - i can do map actions call that
67:51 - and then which actions do i want to map
67:53 - to this component
67:56 - i want
67:58 - read time entries
68:01 - i can't get rid of that um
68:04 - yeah read time entries
68:06 - create no i don't need that one here so
68:08 - just read time entries basically
68:10 - and now i need
68:13 - or i need to call read time entries so
68:16 - this will be called on a created
68:19 - so let me add my life cycle hook here
68:22 - created
68:23 - so when this
68:25 - component
68:27 - actually no i'll do mounted so
68:30 - when this component mounts to the screen
68:34 - it should
68:35 - [Music]
68:37 - call my action
68:40 - uh which is
68:42 - this dot
68:44 - read
68:45 - time entries now
68:48 - and then i don't need to pass anything
68:49 - in
68:50 - so i can do this.readtime entries
68:54 - which we'll call this and then it should
68:56 - lock up log out my docs
68:58 - so let me see
69:00 - if that works
69:02 - sweet
69:04 - why does it say two rows
69:06 - oh i must have uh
69:11 - saved it twice
69:14 - saved something twice where's my name in
69:16 - this
69:22 - okay that's weird it seems like it's
69:24 - just an id
69:25 - and nothing else
69:27 - that i saved all right
69:31 - that's fine
69:33 - so anyway that's coming back with docs
69:35 - and
69:38 - that is
69:39 - yeah so i'll need to do rows
69:42 - so docs is this whole object and then i
69:45 - need to do dot rows so that's kind of
69:47 - like response.data
69:50 - so
69:51 - let me then do
69:53 - um so here's actually where i need a
69:55 - mutation because i need to update the
69:59 - docs here
70:00 - so let me
70:03 - commit a mutation from here
70:06 - and
70:07 - i'll need to
70:09 - do
70:11 - what is it set i guess set time entries
70:16 - and then pass in
70:18 - docs dot rows
70:22 - and then
70:24 - in
70:28 - state so state i need to have all
70:32 - time entries
70:35 - okay and then i i guess i'll also oh
70:38 - that will be an array actually
70:40 - so that's an array and then i need
70:41 - projects here
70:43 - which i'll need in a minute and that's
70:44 - also an array
70:46 - and then i need to create that mutation
70:48 - that i'm calling so set time entries
70:51 - needs to be a mutation which is not
70:53 - async
70:55 - inside a mutation i have access to state
70:59 - and i have access to whatever i'm
71:02 - passing in
71:03 - which is the
71:05 - i like to use the word payload
71:08 - i don't know how many people use that
71:10 - but it's just like a general word for
71:12 - anything that i'm passing in
71:15 - so
71:17 - now i can do this
71:20 - no i don't need this because i already
71:21 - have state available to me in the
71:23 - function
71:24 - so now i can overwrite state
71:28 - on time entries
71:32 - which is equal to the payload that i'm
71:34 - passing in
71:40 - oh commit is not defined i forgot to
71:42 - import
71:44 - or get commit in the function so
71:47 - here i need commit
71:52 - that should work now let me look at my
71:54 - view
71:56 - um
71:59 - where is it here it is oh cool it called
72:01 - the mutation set time entries
72:04 - and now
72:07 - i have the payload with two objects
72:11 - which
72:12 - is weird i'm gonna have to figure that
72:14 - out
72:15 - but anyway
72:16 - it did work
72:17 - and
72:19 - so that is my store now i have an array
72:21 - of time entries
72:25 - cool
72:28 - so now i need to be able to create one
72:31 - create time entry from
72:34 - the
72:36 - time entry dot view page
72:42 - i like payload
72:43 - it sounds very serious
72:46 - does it
72:47 - what is payload in the military
72:50 - oh this like dropping a bomb or
72:52 - something
72:53 - that's that's kind of gruesome
72:55 - that makes me not want to use the bird
72:57 - anymore
72:59 - um okay so i have dates here
73:05 - okay
73:06 - okay i get it i get it
73:08 - um
73:09 - so when i click submit
73:11 - i'm going to
73:14 - call this action that i need to be
73:17 - getting from view x so here also
73:20 - i'm going to have to import
73:23 - [Music]
73:25 - map
73:26 - actions
73:28 - from
73:29 - view
73:30 - x and
73:34 - i'm trying not to save after every time
73:36 - because it switches me back to the other
73:37 - screen
73:40 - um okay
73:42 - oh yeah methods now i need to
73:45 - do math actions
73:48 - and
73:49 - which action do i want
73:51 - it's create time entry oops
73:55 - and now
73:58 - i can call this dot create time entry
74:01 - and then i need to pass it a payload
74:05 - of what i want to create which is
74:07 - form data
74:09 - so actually
74:11 - i can just pass it as an object here
74:13 - because that's what my payload is
74:14 - expecting
74:16 - so i can do
74:19 - this dot
74:22 - form data
74:24 - um
74:25 - oh
74:26 - yeah but how am i doing start date and
74:29 - date i'll have to look at how i'm saving
74:31 - those
74:33 - um in what format but this is okay just
74:37 - to get this working for now
74:40 - um
74:42 - so let me go to add time entry
74:46 - choose
74:49 - uh today
74:53 - choose today and then end date
74:58 - after some hours submit
75:04 - okay
75:05 - i might have to do prevent default there
75:07 - let me see if it
75:12 - did
75:13 - add anything
75:15 - i think i have to go back to
75:17 - this page because this is where it loads
75:19 - the hours
75:24 - company one no that was just that was
75:27 - already there never mind
75:28 - um
75:32 - so
75:33 - let me look at
75:35 - this state here
75:37 - yeah it did add it though
75:39 - value
75:42 - set time entries
75:48 - why is it not showing
75:53 - the actual value here
75:57 - i guess that's
76:00 - um let me refresh this
76:03 - let me refresh this
76:04 - database refresh
76:07 - and
76:09 - so here okay i do see start date and
76:11 - date
76:14 - all right
76:15 - and
76:19 - these are
76:22 - time stamps okay
76:24 - actually i can
76:26 - bring the value over here
76:30 - okay that's actually pretty good
76:32 - i have start date and date that's
76:34 - exactly what i want
76:36 - um then why am i doing this i think what
76:39 - i need to be doing here is actually
76:41 - having a string
76:43 - not an object
76:45 - i think that's
76:47 - from something i had before
76:52 - okay so now i can create
76:54 - i can pull them from the database
76:58 - um i could loop through these actually
77:01 - in my
77:02 - hours log
77:05 - kalachi factory
77:08 - um
77:10 - oh i missed
77:12 - okay
77:13 - um
77:18 - talking about food makes me hungry what
77:20 - was i doing i can't remember oh yeah
77:22 - hours long i want to loop through these
77:24 - and display them in the table
77:27 - so be table striped hover
77:30 - and then items
77:32 - it's kind of a really simple table i
77:34 - want to denote
77:36 - like
77:37 - which
77:38 - i guess which headers i want
77:41 - um well let me map state to this
77:42 - component
77:44 - i want to get those time entries off of
77:46 - ux
77:48 - so
77:50 - map
77:51 - state
77:53 - to the component and now i need to
77:56 - create computed here
78:00 - so that i can see the updates that
78:01 - happen in my view x state
78:04 - and let me do map state here
78:09 - and what state do i want to map
78:12 - [Music]
78:13 - here it is
78:15 - so
78:17 - my state is i have this array of time
78:20 - entries
78:21 - that i want to map here
78:24 - so now i can see all the time entries in
78:26 - this component
78:28 - and then
78:30 - i could
78:33 - on this table here i could just pass in
78:35 - time entries
78:37 - and see how it looks
78:41 - that looks awful
78:43 - um
78:47 - yeah why aren't i getting the correct
78:49 - values back i guess
78:52 - from the database i'm doing this wrong
78:56 - so
78:57 - let me see
79:04 - deleted documents are only included
79:11 - oh okay i need to do include docs
79:15 - thanks
79:17 - options not include docs i need to set
79:19 - this to true because otherwise i just
79:21 - get the id and
79:24 - i i guess rev is for revision
79:27 - and that changes when i update it i'm
79:29 - guessing
79:30 - um
79:32 - okay so options.include docs
79:36 - so i need to
79:39 - set this
79:41 - in no in my
79:44 - database
79:47 - um in my get so here
79:51 - um
79:53 - so is it an array
79:55 - yeah it's an array of options
80:00 - so how does that look
80:04 - okay no it's an object i'd pass it yeah
80:06 - it would be weird as an array i guess
80:08 - they were just using brackets
80:10 - as a placeholder there okay
80:13 - so
80:15 - include docs is true
80:21 - [Music]
80:25 - is true
80:27 - any other options i want
80:29 - attachments
80:31 - are attachments
80:35 - include that as okay so those are like
80:37 - images and stuff
80:40 - uh maybe i want that
80:42 - sure
80:43 - um actually i don't need that here so
80:46 - maybe i'll do that when i actually have
80:47 - images like on the profile or something
80:52 - okay
80:54 - so now
80:58 - okay now i have the doc
81:02 - and
81:03 - i'm going to need to
81:06 - yeah i'm going to need to clean up this
81:08 - database a little bit
81:10 - but
81:12 - what was i oh yeah in the code
81:14 - so i have this
81:17 - and i'm setting docs.rows
81:21 - and let me see what
81:22 - docs.rows are
81:24 - i guess it's docs.rows.dock
81:27 - i have to do it
81:29 - let me see what it said as time entries
81:32 - now
81:34 - so
81:35 - oh dot value
81:39 - no dot value is already there
81:41 - i need this i need doc
81:47 - rose.doc
81:55 - okay
81:57 - and now i get nothing
82:01 - let me undo that
82:04 - and let me
82:06 - it might be easier if i just console.log
82:08 - out these docs dot rows
82:12 - so i can explore them
82:17 - okay so let me take document one
82:23 - and this is what i want i want
82:26 - um
82:28 - oh right right that was dumb so i want
82:30 - the documents here so i'm going to pass
82:32 - in
82:33 - actually to my mutation i'm going to
82:35 - pass in
82:36 - docs.rows and then in my mutation
82:41 - and i might move this into a helper
82:43 - function but i need to do take the
82:45 - payload
82:47 - and loop through these
82:49 - so
82:50 - payload
82:52 - dot four each
82:55 - um
82:56 - now i can do a map because
82:58 - i'm gonna want
83:00 - uh
83:01 - i can do an array instead of just
83:02 - pushing individually so let me take i
83:05 - don't know why i did it this way but
83:07 - okay
83:08 - so payload.map
83:11 - and
83:14 - i need to call a function
83:17 - which will be
83:20 - entry
83:23 - and
83:25 - basically going to take
83:28 - entry dot
83:30 - doc
83:35 - return entry dot doc
83:39 - uh
83:40 - and i think that's what i want
83:43 - let me see yeah that looks better anyway
83:48 - and then
83:50 - so
83:50 - this is so what bootstrap is doing is
83:53 - looking at these first this first
83:54 - document and saying okay
83:57 - it has
83:58 - a name
84:03 - um
84:04 - key and an id yeah i don't know why this
84:06 - database is set up like this i haven't
84:08 - read too much into it it just looked
84:10 - like the best one out of all the end of
84:12 - bjs options i saw
84:14 - um but yeah the database table here is
84:16 - taking
84:17 - the names of
84:20 - just this first item and then putting
84:22 - them in the header but this one here
84:24 - with timestamps isn't showing up so i
84:26 - need to do some database cleanup first
84:29 - and let me do that here
84:32 - let me delete these two
84:36 - entries that are just
84:38 - dummy entries delete
84:42 - okay so
84:50 - and then also i'm wondering
84:54 - yeah i'm wondering if key
84:56 - if i'm supposed to be pulling
84:59 - things out by key if i should be having
85:01 - this as unique because it still has
85:04 - a primary key here that is generating
85:06 - for me
85:07 - so yeah i'll have to read more about how
85:09 - that works
85:10 - but now i have start date and date so
85:14 - if i
85:15 - refresh
85:17 - oh let me reload app
85:21 - wait
85:22 - exit
85:26 - and
85:27 - now it's not
85:29 - it's not showing anything
85:32 - hours log
85:35 - um let me go to a different page and
85:37 - navigate back
85:40 - yeah it's not showing anything
85:42 - so
85:45 - let me look at the view x
85:48 - store real quick
85:51 - and see what i have set time entries
85:54 - i can refresh this
85:59 - and
86:03 - so why is it still
86:06 - i deleted them directly from here
86:10 - so i wonder
86:12 - if i need to reset this
86:15 - refresh index db
86:21 - now let me try to reload this
86:29 - okay it's not showing up at all now
86:31 - and in my view
86:33 - dev
86:34 - tools i have the same three time entries
86:38 - that aren't supposed to exist anymore
86:43 - oh all right
86:48 - so oh these two are empty now
86:52 - and that other one's full that's why the
86:54 - table's not showing up
86:55 - because
86:57 - these first two objects
87:01 - are empty
87:04 - um
87:06 - yeah
87:07 - and then this object isn't because it
87:10 - was the only one that wasn't deleted
87:13 - um so how do i fix this i guess i can
87:18 - call just manually call a delete
87:23 - delete document
87:25 - db.remove
87:27 - and then the document id
87:30 - so let me call this
87:33 - just up here
87:36 - so i guess i'll do
87:38 - time entries db
87:41 - and just call it manually and i'll have
87:42 - a vx action for this at some point dot
87:46 - remove and then i need to pass in
87:49 - the
87:51 - id of what the one i want to remove
88:02 - um
88:11 - that didn't seem to remove anything
88:13 - though
88:15 - maybe i need to restart the server let
88:18 - me just
88:19 - completely restart everything
88:28 - new pouch db
88:31 - mydb destroy
88:36 - okay i could call db.destroy
88:39 - let me if this doesn't work i'm going to
88:41 - destroy it
88:47 - and it looks like it's not working yeah
88:49 - it's not working
88:51 - okay
88:52 - yeah until i have all my crud operations
88:55 - set up
88:56 - i'm just going to call
89:00 - i'm just going to call destroy
89:05 - destroy
89:12 - can i do it on there
89:19 - good sweet
89:20 - now let me do projects
89:28 - okay cool so now they're both
89:31 - completely refreshed
89:34 - they didn't have the
89:37 - thanks for the help sashi they didn't
89:38 - have the edgy potato breakfast bun i
89:41 - have no idea what that is
89:44 - i've had kolaches though i think aren't
89:46 - they eastern european
89:49 - or something
89:52 - um when i was in serbia the person i
89:55 - stayed with
89:56 - fed me something like that so it might
89:58 - not have been a kolache but it was
90:01 - some kind of bread with
90:03 - a bunch of flavorful stuff inside
90:07 - um
90:09 - okay
90:10 - so now if i go to view us there is zero
90:12 - chance
90:14 - yes
90:15 - nothing there that's good
90:18 - now i can add an actually valid time
90:20 - entry
90:24 - and date
90:26 - um
90:27 - what date was that
90:30 - 722
90:36 - and
90:40 - do that
90:41 - submit
90:47 - okay and now actually to pull
90:50 - i have to
90:52 - go back here sweet
90:54 - so i have start date end date
90:56 - id and rev now the bootstrap table is
91:00 - kind of
91:01 - annoying
91:02 - um
91:04 - let me
91:05 - oh oops let me go here
91:08 - and see bootstrap
91:12 - egg oh eggy
91:16 - i read that wrong
91:17 - iggy potato bun that makes more sense
91:20 - for breakfast
91:21 - not edgy potatoes
91:25 - table table
91:29 - tables
91:32 - okay i'm using the table
91:35 - and
91:40 - pass in items
91:52 - cell variance okay
91:56 - column definition okay i can define
91:58 - columns
92:00 - so the fields prop
92:03 - is used to customize
92:05 - the
92:07 - table column headings in which order the
92:09 - columns of data are displayed okay
92:12 - that's good
92:14 - um
92:15 - first name last name age
92:19 - okay so now i need to pass in fields
92:21 - which is an array of the titles that i
92:24 - want
92:25 - camel cased
92:28 - not camel case snake case
92:30 - so
92:31 - let me go to my
92:33 - time entry
92:36 - oh no it's the hours log this is where
92:37 - the table
92:38 - is and
92:40 - here so
92:43 - um
92:46 - i'm doing okay
92:49 - let's actually
92:50 - put these on different lines it's
92:52 - starting to get long
92:58 - and now i can pass in
93:01 - um fields
93:03 - and i'm going to create a fields array
93:06 - for called fields
93:11 - and
93:12 - so items i actually don't need items
93:14 - anymore
93:16 - but i do need
93:17 - fields
93:20 - so
93:21 - this will be
93:24 - start date and date so let me do start
93:29 - date
93:32 - end
93:34 - date
93:39 - okay but it doesn't line up because i
93:42 - think because the names aren't exactly
93:44 - the same
93:47 - so
93:49 - um oh yeah because these aren't snake
93:51 - cased
93:52 - they are camel cased
93:54 - so let me line these up here then
93:58 - date
94:01 - and date
94:04 - that should yeah that worked okay and
94:07 - then i just need moment
94:09 - to format these dates a little bit
94:11 - better let me go ahead and do that let
94:13 - me install moment
94:14 - um i'm going to add the name here but
94:16 - that's only after i get the projects all
94:18 - set up
94:20 - so
94:24 - lincoln park i haven't heard them in
94:26 - forever
94:27 - um
94:28 - okay i need to install moment.js so
94:31 - moment
94:33 - is that spell right moment yeah
94:43 - all right
94:48 - so now
95:01 - this is weird because my little preview
95:03 - still shows the
95:05 - live in three minutes sign
95:08 - but the chat is working fine
95:10 - so
95:12 - okay
95:14 - uh
95:16 - that's okay
95:17 - now i have a moment so let me go ahead
95:19 - and do npm start
95:23 - and
95:26 - yeah run the app again
95:29 - and now i can format these dates
95:32 - so i'm going to create a function here
95:36 - let's see
95:38 - um
95:40 - time entry no an hour's log
95:42 - in mounted
95:44 - no in methods i'm going to create a
95:46 - method
95:47 - so
95:48 - uh
95:50 - let's see
95:52 - i'll just yeah i'll call it format date
95:55 - format date pass in a date
95:58 - and then i can return
96:01 - moment
96:02 - dot
96:03 - oh i need to pass the date into moment
96:05 - and then i can do dot format
96:08 - and then say the format that i want
96:11 - and let me import moment here before i
96:13 - forget
96:14 - so let me import
96:17 - moment from
96:19 - moment
96:22 - um
96:23 - and then format
96:26 - month
96:28 - day
96:30 - year
96:32 - um
96:33 - [Music]
96:34 - and then
96:36 - how do i put the
96:37 - minutes like oh i think it's
96:40 - uh
96:42 - minutes
96:44 - seconds something like that
96:46 - and then am or pm
96:51 - no wait this is hours i don't want
96:52 - seconds
96:54 - uh
96:55 - hours and then minutes that looks better
97:01 - um oh yeah i'm not calling the function
97:03 - yet i was like why aren't my dates
97:04 - formatted
97:06 - so let me go here
97:09 - and
97:11 - oh hmm
97:13 - i'm gonna have to
97:15 - format okay so this dot read time
97:18 - entries
97:22 - um
97:23 - how how am i going to do this because
97:27 - i'm taking this directly from view x
97:31 - from view x
97:34 - so
97:36 - how am i going to format the dates as
97:38 - they appear here
97:41 - um
97:42 - so i wonder should i use a slot
97:45 - like if there are slots on the table
97:48 - i don't know if bootstrap has anything
97:50 - fancy like that
97:58 - key
98:00 - um i could map out the data
98:06 - um
98:11 - let's see
98:12 - fields primary key
98:14 - let me search if they have a slot
98:18 - used to trigger the display of row
98:20 - details scope slot
98:29 - custom header and footer slots
98:33 - um what about column slots there's
98:35 - formatter format or callback or the name
98:38 - of the method in the component
98:40 - and this is exactly what i want
98:43 - scoped field slots the formatter will be
98:46 - called with the syntax
98:47 - formatter
98:50 - value key item
98:53 - so
98:56 - field definition reference
99:00 - um so this is this is what i want but
99:03 - then again
99:04 - i'm pulling this in from view x
99:06 - so that kind of has the same problem how
99:08 - do i
99:10 - format what's coming in from view x
99:13 - so should i use
99:17 - um
99:20 - what should i use here should i use
99:21 - computed maybe
99:23 - a computed method
99:26 - and
99:29 - watch time entries basically
99:32 - i could call the computed something like
99:34 - entries
99:36 - is this what i should be doing does
99:37 - anyone know what i'm talking about
99:40 - so i could do something like entries
99:45 - and
99:48 - from here so from computed i don't think
99:50 - i can call a method
99:52 - but
99:55 - um
99:57 - i can map the
99:59 - this dot time entries right
100:03 - uh yeah so i can do uh this dot time
100:05 - entries
100:07 - dot map
100:10 - and i'll return this so this time entry
100:12 - stop map
100:14 - and then
100:16 - entry
100:19 - and then when i'm looping through it
100:23 - i need to
100:25 - so let me return
100:29 - the whole entry
100:33 - except for
100:36 - the times which is the whole entry
100:38 - um
100:39 - yeah start date and date
100:41 - so
100:44 - i'm gonna do overwrite start date
100:47 - and
100:49 - and
100:50 - date
100:52 - and these are going to be
100:55 - format date
100:56 - ah
100:57 - okay
100:58 - um
101:00 - so
101:01 - let me just try and see if it works i
101:03 - don't even know if this is the best way
101:05 - i should be doing this
101:07 - so
101:07 - [Music]
101:10 - date here will be
101:12 - entry dot
101:14 - um
101:16 - end
101:17 - date
101:21 - and this will be
101:24 - start date
101:30 - start
101:32 - date
101:38 - okay
101:41 - um oh yeah and then i have to
101:43 - take this
101:46 - which is this entries method
101:49 - and see if i can just loop through these
101:54 - or no these will be the items in the
101:56 - table now
101:59 - okay cool that works anyway
102:02 - um
102:03 - i'm not calling another method i could
102:05 - just make this an external method then
102:08 - this format date one that's not in the
102:10 - component
102:12 - but yeah that works well this is a
102:16 - a real time entry
102:18 - and i can add another one so let me add
102:21 - one here
102:23 - let's see
102:28 - let me add one here
102:37 - and go to the hours
102:40 - log sweet and now i have all of my
102:44 - time entries
102:46 - that's pretty good
102:48 - i have like 15 minutes left
102:51 - let me see first of all when i add a new
102:53 - entry this should really be routing back
102:57 - yeah i'm happy about that i was nervous
102:59 - at the at first because i was like oh no
103:01 - i don't know how to deal with databases
103:03 - and desktop apps
103:05 - but
103:06 - it's not too bad
103:08 - uh
103:08 - after figuring it out
103:12 - and i'm sure
103:13 - i can just keep making it better and
103:15 - tweaking it but overall it's yeah pretty
103:18 - good
103:20 - let's see
103:22 - um what was i just doing oh yeah i need
103:24 - to route back after
103:26 - i
103:27 - save the entry
103:30 - so
103:32 - i call on submit
103:34 - and i save it
103:36 - and then
103:39 - yeah using set
103:42 - set time entries
103:44 - no no that's my mutation i'm doing
103:46 - create time entry
103:48 - and
103:50 - i save it here so actually here
103:55 - i should be
103:58 - let me import my router here
104:03 - import
104:06 - from
104:11 - a
104:12 - router because i have an index file in
104:14 - my router folder too
104:17 - okay so now i'm importing router
104:20 - and so i should be able to
104:22 - push
104:23 - from here
104:24 - so i can do router.push
104:28 - and
104:28 - what route do i want to go to
104:32 - um
104:35 - let's see
104:39 - which one oh yeah ours log
104:43 - oh that's the home route okay well
104:46 - i'll just push
104:48 - um if i'm pushing by name oops what did
104:50 - i just do
104:53 - um if i'm pushing by name in the other
104:56 - place then i should probably do it by
104:57 - name here too
104:59 - so uh
105:03 - ty no i can't i forgot already hours log
105:07 - hours log
105:10 - okay
105:16 - all right so one more time entry
105:19 - for
105:20 - two days ago i'll have to sort these
105:24 - um
105:26 - based off of date too
105:30 - oh come on
105:32 - it didn't push
105:34 - um
105:35 - i wonder if that's because it's
105:37 - submitting
105:40 - yeah
105:41 - it was surprising
105:43 - i was worried in the beginning because i
105:44 - kind of got stuck
105:46 - and
105:50 - yeah but i'm very happy with this
105:53 - project i'm actually excited about
105:55 - working on it more
105:57 - so let's see
105:59 - um
106:00 - why isn't it pushing
106:02 - so on submit am i actually doing a
106:04 - submit
106:06 - yeah this is actually type submit so i
106:08 - think what i need to do
106:10 - is
106:12 - um maybe
106:15 - e dot
106:16 - e dot
106:18 - prevent
106:19 - default
106:22 - good
106:24 - sashi d or sassy do you uh do any
106:27 - desktop apps
106:32 - or desktop app development
106:38 - um let's see the 27th
106:43 - we work till 10 pm
106:46 - submit
106:48 - sweet do i have my i have my 27th there
106:51 - great
106:52 - so i have my time entries now
106:56 - um i wonder in the next like
106:59 - five minutes or so
107:01 - if i could just set up projects real
107:03 - quick
107:05 - so let me go
107:06 - here projects
107:11 - and
107:13 - i've done applications using
107:15 - swing i've never heard of that
107:18 - swing in java
107:20 - so i guess that's a framework for making
107:22 - desktop apps with java
107:25 - don't forget to do commits and push yes
107:27 - i won't
107:28 - and last time i was in such a hurry i
107:31 - force pushed and overwrote my readme and
107:33 - had to hand type it out again
107:36 - which was
107:38 - really dumb
107:39 - um
107:41 - okay so project now let me let me try to
107:44 - enter a project
107:45 - real quick
107:47 - get rid of all these time entry files
107:50 - let's open
107:52 - project entry
107:55 - and so i have on submit here so let me
107:58 - do the prevent default before i forget
108:01 - prevent
108:02 - default
108:04 - okay
108:06 - and now i need to call
108:10 - let me open my store
108:13 - and i need to call
108:15 - this create project
108:20 - um
108:21 - let's see
108:22 - yeah and pass it the payload of the
108:24 - project that i want to create looks like
108:27 - it's set up already so i'll just import
108:29 - create
108:30 - project all right
108:33 - [Music]
108:35 - i'll have to call this dot create
108:37 - project and pass it a payload but first
108:40 - i need to set up
108:41 - view x so map
108:44 - actions
108:46 - and i need the
108:48 - create project action
108:51 - and then
108:53 - oh wait
108:56 - uh import
108:58 - um
108:59 - map actions
109:02 - from view x
109:09 - okay and then this dot create project i
109:11 - need to pass in form data
109:14 - so i'm just going to pass that in
109:16 - because that's already an object so this
109:18 - dot form data
109:20 - and that should work
109:24 - so
109:26 - that's another thing i'll have to add
109:28 - form validation next time too
109:31 - so let me try typing in a name of a
109:33 - project
109:35 - let's say
109:37 - view
109:38 - tracking app
109:41 - uh
109:42 - our
109:44 - tracking app
109:46 - built in view
109:48 - what color do i want
109:51 - let's say
109:53 - orange
109:56 - submit
109:59 - success
110:01 - okay cool
110:02 - and now
110:05 - i want to
110:06 - reroute
110:10 - the same way i'm doing here so let me
110:11 - just yank that
110:14 - and push to
110:17 - wait push to
110:20 - not hours log but
110:23 - projects
110:24 - so let me push to
110:26 - projects
110:30 - so let me create one more project
110:33 - and i'll call this
110:35 - um
110:37 - i don't know
110:39 - grid some app
110:42 - so
110:46 - let me say grid some blog
110:49 - choose a color
110:51 - do
110:52 - blue
110:54 - that's a good color
110:56 - submit
110:57 - cool
110:59 - so now i need to display the projects
111:02 - oh no because i was actually thinking
111:04 - about having them in the drop down here
111:08 - is that
111:09 - a good idea how many projects are people
111:11 - gonna have
111:12 - you know
111:14 - um
111:14 - oh well
111:16 - i already have the drop down so
111:18 - might as well keep it but i need a
111:20 - getter though
111:22 - so
111:24 - i have read time entries which gets all
111:26 - the time entries
111:27 - let me
111:30 - put
111:31 - uh read projects here
111:35 - read projects
111:38 - and
111:40 - this will return
111:43 - everything from
111:44 - the projects db but i also need a
111:47 - different mutation though
111:49 - so set time entries i'm going to need
111:51 - set
111:53 - projects here
111:55 - set projects
111:59 - [Music]
112:00 - and what do i need here okay so set
112:04 - projects state
112:06 - payload and this will basically be the
112:09 - same thing
112:11 - from there
112:12 - um
112:15 - exactly the same thing actually so
112:20 - except this
112:22 - and it just keeps coming back because i
112:24 - every time i save it okay state.projects
112:27 - this time i'm overwriting projects
112:29 - payload
112:30 - entry
112:31 - entry.doc that's all how the database
112:35 - data is set up so
112:37 - that's all fine
112:39 - um set projects db projects okay so read
112:44 - projects i'm going to have to
112:47 - import this into
112:49 - my projects.view file
112:52 - um
112:54 - okay i don't actually have
112:57 - any
112:58 - script tag in here
113:01 - so
113:02 - let me do
113:07 - no i need computed here
113:10 - actually i should have a name for the
113:11 - component that would be
113:13 - the best thing so
113:15 - it'll line up with view router called
113:17 - projects and now i'll do
113:20 - computed
113:22 - and here is where i'm going to map state
113:28 - which will be projects
113:31 - projects okay
113:33 - and
113:34 - i need to
113:36 - import map state so import
113:39 - map
113:40 - state
113:42 - from view x
113:45 - and
113:48 - let's see
113:52 - um map state no what am i doing it's not
113:55 - projects
113:56 - oh it is projects but i need it in the
113:58 - array so projects
114:01 - from state and now i have access to
114:04 - this.projects
114:06 - um
114:07 - but i need to get that into state in the
114:09 - first place or the new projects so i
114:12 - need a life cycle hook here so i'm going
114:14 - to use
114:15 - the mounted lifecycle hook again and
114:17 - call this dot
114:20 - read projects
114:23 - to get those into state
114:25 - i don't need to pass anything in
114:29 - um
114:30 - but
114:31 - oh i need to map
114:33 - that action so map actions
114:38 - and that's going to have to be
114:41 - inside of methods
114:45 - so a methods object oops
114:48 - um
114:51 - let's see methods object
114:53 - and
114:56 - that will be
114:57 - map
114:58 - actions
115:00 - and then
115:02 - pass in
115:07 - yeah read projects
115:09 - okay so now i can call this.reprojects
115:12 - that should update the projects there
115:14 - and then i should be able to
115:18 - use the array of projects here
115:21 - to loop through
115:24 - select so i'm actually going to have to
115:26 - use a computed here
115:28 - to map these projects in the way that i
115:31 - need them but i'll have to look at how
115:34 - oh it says payload is not defined
115:36 - okay that must be
115:38 - where is that
115:41 - um it's not giving me a file but i'm
115:43 - guessing it's
115:46 - let's see
115:49 - create project
115:52 - read projects
115:55 - docs dot rose
115:58 - oh
115:59 - because there aren't any rows i think
116:02 - and i'm calling reed projects with no
116:04 - rows
116:06 - um
116:11 - so
116:12 - oh yeah and then i'm trying to so i
116:13 - could do
116:17 - i could do this
116:19 - uh i think it's locked up oh no
116:22 - it's back now okay
116:24 - i could do this pass in an empty array
116:27 - if there aren't any rows
116:32 - payload is not defined
116:34 - where is payload not defined
116:40 - okay so it's saying here
116:46 - um in set projects payload isn't defined
116:48 - yeah and because i'm trying to map
116:50 - through that payload
116:51 - so
116:54 - let's see
116:57 - but i think that this so doc's dot rose
117:01 - or empty array
117:03 - i think that that will fix the problem
117:07 - um
117:11 - oh it's still it's still doing that so
117:14 - um
117:16 - yeah i don't know why the ore doesn't
117:18 - work there
117:19 - um but
117:21 - i have two minutes
117:23 - yeah
117:25 - i do okay so
117:27 - this line right here we have to fix this
117:30 - line the error on this line and be able
117:32 - to display projects on this page so if
117:35 - someone has an idea about that after the
117:36 - stream then let me know
117:39 - i am going to push my code now
117:43 - and if you want to check out
117:45 - uh more of my live streams i do a lot of
117:47 - vue.js live streams and django live

119:20 - uh just to put all the things that i
119:22 - still need to work on on this app
