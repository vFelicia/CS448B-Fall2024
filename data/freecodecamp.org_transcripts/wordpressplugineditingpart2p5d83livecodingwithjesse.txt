00:08 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:10 - with jesse i'm jesse
00:12 - today we're going to continue on with
00:14 - what we did yesterday which was editing
00:18 - wordpress plugins to try to get
00:21 - data from
00:22 - our custom fields to show up
00:28 - in the the data we get from the wp
00:30 - graphql plug-in
00:32 - so since yesterday i was able to get
00:34 - some of the data but not the data from
00:37 - the repeater fields
00:39 - so
00:40 - quick recap on what i've done since
00:42 - yesterday and then we'll get into the
00:45 - code
00:45 - i'm streaming from home and my computer
00:48 - is
00:49 - just kind of lagging
00:50 - quite a bit here
00:53 - so i've been
00:55 - rushing to close everything that i can
00:58 - that i don't need so just let me know
01:00 - how the quality is
01:02 - i'll um
01:06 - i'll close more things as i need to uh
01:09 - if it's if the quality is no good
01:16 - all right so
01:18 - since yesterday i've installed the
01:21 - wp
01:23 - graphql
01:25 - plug-in
01:28 - uh so this was a plug-in that was in
01:31 - really really early beta
01:34 - uh so it's it's not finished
01:36 - but it is able to give me data from some
01:39 - of my custom fields
01:42 - which is good it's good you know some
01:45 - data is better than none
01:47 - but the next step
01:49 - and what we were working on yesterday
01:50 - anyway was getting data from our peter
01:53 - fields
01:54 - so
01:55 - let me switch over to my code
01:59 - and to show you what i'm what i'm trying
02:01 - to do
02:06 - let's bring that down a bit
02:11 - okay so
02:13 - what i what i have here is that wp
02:16 - graphql acf plug-in i've forked this
02:20 - and
02:22 - this is the fork that i'm working with
02:24 - i've started a test branch
02:27 - and this is going to be where i play
02:29 - around and see if i can get something to
02:31 - happen
02:34 - so far the only thing i've done
02:37 - other than just trying to figure out
02:39 - what's going on by looking at all the
02:41 - files
02:43 - is i've added that code that we had
02:45 - yesterday that we tried to put in our
02:46 - other plugin i've added that here
02:51 - and
02:52 - nothing really happened
02:54 - which
02:55 - was kind of expected right why would the
02:57 - same code do anything in a different
02:59 - plug-in
03:00 - um but i thought it was worth a shot
03:07 - and i've continued to look through
03:09 - the code that some other people were
03:11 - using
03:13 - and
03:15 - so here's
03:16 - let me just tell you what i'm thinking
03:18 - of the next steps to take
03:20 - and then you all can weigh in as well
03:25 - so
03:27 - in this plugin
03:29 - they have types.ph
03:37 - all right so in types.php
03:39 - they're importing
03:42 - all of these
03:43 - that they've created in in this folder
03:46 - of
03:47 - you know all these um
03:50 - so field type
03:52 - field group type so they're all separate
03:54 - files and they're importing that
03:56 - uh so just first
04:01 - we'll just check out
04:02 - you know here's the things that they're
04:04 - bringing in
04:08 - and then they're creating these
04:09 - functions
04:12 - and it looks like all the functions are
04:14 - doing similar things
04:20 - uh this one's a bit more complex
04:31 - and then finally if we check out
04:34 - one of these
04:36 - types
04:43 - all right we can see
04:46 - what they're doing in here
05:04 - which
05:05 - looks a little bit like what we were
05:07 - trying to do
05:08 - right so we have our our name our
05:12 - description right so
05:15 - not exactly the same
05:23 - but we like
05:25 - i don't know i feel i'm getting a rough
05:27 - idea of maybe
05:30 - what we could do
05:47 - so let's maybe we could get a side by
05:49 - side and that'll be easier let's do that
05:57 - let's make some space here
05:59 - and just compare
06:07 - okay so
06:10 - here
06:13 - we have two parts to this
06:18 - and it looks like we also have that here
06:21 - in our
06:25 - in our definition
06:26 - um what do we have up here
06:35 - it looks like we have fields and type
06:38 - and we also have it here it's just
06:40 - flipped around
06:41 - right so
06:43 - i guess we'll go with fields first
06:48 - so fields
06:50 - and then
06:51 - so
06:52 - id
06:55 - so we've spelled out links here but
06:58 - this is id
07:01 - so our type
07:07 - description the global id for the field
07:28 - okay
07:29 - yeah the these are very similar so
07:32 - i'm guessing that this
07:35 - is serving you know the same function
07:39 - that this is
07:40 - the difference being that
07:43 - this one is is just targeting one
07:45 - specific
07:46 - custom field
07:48 - and i believe that this
07:51 - is being applied you know across the
07:53 - board to any
07:56 - any custom field
08:02 - let's check out
08:04 - that type
08:05 - for a second
08:42 - all right
08:43 - that's interesting
08:47 - so this this does have a lot more
08:54 - yeah quite a bit more
09:06 - alright so we may not need that much
09:25 - it may not mean that need that much but
09:28 - you know maybe this gives an idea of
09:32 - like what's the other stuff that we're
09:34 - missing that would make this work
09:39 - and
09:40 - i never forget to start my pomodoro
09:42 - timer so i'm gonna start that now
09:53 - okay
09:57 - [Music]
10:04 - all right so let me
10:07 - let me say hi to everybody in the chat
10:09 - how's it going
10:10 - um
10:15 - let's see
10:19 - okay so looks like
10:21 - the stream is starting and stopping the
10:24 - um
10:25 - the video
10:27 - so let me see
10:29 - i'm gonna shut down
10:33 - my terminal so i had some terminal
10:35 - windows open on my other screen i'm
10:37 - shutting that down i wanted to keep them
10:39 - open in case i broke
10:42 - wordpress through one of the plugins
10:44 - because the uh the only solution if you
10:46 - can't get in the admin panel is then to
10:48 - actually you know manually change the
10:50 - files
10:51 - so i would need to to uh
10:53 - ssh into the droplet and change them
10:58 - but i could start that up quickly enough
11:02 - so that's shut down
11:03 - and i guess i can
11:09 - i don't think i have anything else open
11:12 - that
11:14 - i could shut down maybe a few things up
11:17 - here
11:18 - um
11:19 - [Music]
11:20 - yeah i do have an instance of slack open
11:24 - i can shut that down
11:27 - looks like i have
11:29 - google docs open
11:39 - oh actually i had two instances of slack
11:43 - uh web version open so
11:45 - yeah i definitely don't need that
11:54 - and i had sheets open all right
11:59 - okay that's better so got rid of some
12:01 - tabs open that are
12:03 - notoriously
12:05 - heavy on resources
12:07 - so hopefully that'll help out a bit
12:11 - alright
12:24 - um
12:25 - christian just asked how do you go
12:27 - through a plug-in for wordpress uh i'm
12:29 - not sure
12:31 - oh
12:32 - sorry
12:34 - i'm not exactly sure what you're asking
12:37 - so i don't know if you could um explain
12:38 - it just a little bit more i might be
12:40 - able to answer your question
12:44 - savager red
12:48 - savage red i can't believe i can read
12:50 - that savage red
12:53 - says
12:55 - i wish i could edit live video i would
12:57 - edit that out uh it says what what stack
13:00 - tech or technology should i use for a
13:01 - modern e-commerce website uh it depends
13:04 - on your skill level uh i would say the
13:07 - easiest way to set up an e-commerce
13:08 - website
13:09 - that i know of that i've personally used
13:12 - is to do
13:13 - a wordpress site and then use the
13:14 - woocommerce plugin
13:17 - very easy to set that up
13:19 - if if you've had some experience with
13:21 - wordpress
13:23 - but i'm sure there are
13:25 - other ways out there to do that i can
13:26 - anyway can you do e-commerce with
13:30 - i know there's like magento
13:32 - is
13:33 - you can do with magento um
13:35 - i've never used it so i'm not sure how
13:38 - but i've just heard about it
13:41 - um
13:43 - so
13:45 - that's what i would say
13:47 - but it really does depend on what what
13:50 - stack you're already comfortable with
13:55 - because that i mean that's going to make
13:56 - a big difference on how fast you can get
13:58 - it up and running
14:04 - okay
14:07 - so let's go back here and
14:13 - let's mess things up a bit
14:22 - all right
14:23 - what i'll try to do
14:26 - let me bring some some things over
14:29 - so we could check them out
14:31 - i'm gonna rearrange things just a little
14:35 - and
14:40 - all right the screen's about to get
14:41 - bright because for some reason my github
14:45 - dark theme no longer works
14:47 - so i'm not sure what happened
14:53 - but it just
14:54 - doesn't work i don't know maybe
14:56 - i don't know if github changed a class
14:58 - name or something and messed it up
15:04 - all right so i'm gonna make these should
15:05 - get bigger
15:07 - there we go
15:09 - okay so
15:11 - this is
15:14 - similar
15:16 - to what we were using
15:21 - it's actually you know what it's not
15:22 - exactly the same i wonder
15:26 - if we change some of this
15:28 - if it would help
15:31 - yeah let's do that
15:34 - let's do that
15:36 - okay so
15:39 - this is what i was really wanted to look
15:40 - at is
15:42 - we have some of these extra
15:44 - things here in in this just
15:49 - that
15:50 - you know i'd like to try to maybe just
15:51 - add
15:52 - you know this
15:54 - see what happens um
16:00 - yeah i'm
16:03 - i think it's worth a shot to do a little
16:05 - bit more but
16:06 - um
16:08 - right now what we the code that we have
16:10 - over here is similar but not exactly the
16:13 - same
16:14 - uh to this so i think i want to take
16:17 - this
16:20 - and let's copy it over
16:25 - uh for now we'll just copy it here right
16:27 - in the same file
16:30 - because i
16:31 - it
16:32 - it may be
16:34 - that
16:37 - some of the stuff referenced here didn't
16:39 - work yesterday uh because it was
16:42 - expecting this plugin to be installed
16:45 - that i had did not install yet
16:49 - um the best way to do this is probably
17:01 - i want to show this in both places
17:14 - there we go
17:23 - all right so we'll have the same same
17:24 - file open on both sides
17:28 - that'll allow us to
17:32 - everything
17:33 - normally
17:34 - you'd be able to see enough text to do
17:36 - this but since i have it
17:39 - displayed larger for the stream
17:42 - i think i'm gonna have to do it like
17:43 - this
17:49 - there we go
17:54 - okay
17:58 - so i think we can change
18:01 - stats
18:05 - we could even grab it up here and start
18:06 - to change it
18:12 - let's try to change stats to links in as
18:16 - many places as we can
18:20 - see
18:26 - links
18:27 - okay
18:28 - and then now
18:32 - we can check and see if we have any
18:36 - other uppercase instances of this but i
18:38 - think that's it so
18:41 - links
18:43 - okay
18:45 - and then in here
18:48 - we will just copy and paste what we have
18:59 - right because our
19:01 - interior fields here are different
19:06 - there we go
19:10 - and then let's just compare down here
19:24 - see this is the big difference i'm
19:26 - seeing
19:27 - um
19:30 - inside
19:31 - inside of here
19:43 - yeah big difference okay
19:47 - so
19:50 - let's
19:51 - remove this i think we have this
19:55 - still um
19:57 - available somewhere so
19:59 - i'm okay removing it
20:14 - and i'm going to save that
20:19 - i'm gonna get rid of that
20:22 - on that side
20:24 - okay so now that i've saved this
20:30 - let's go with
20:34 - let's make sure i haven't changed
20:36 - anything i didn't mean to
20:38 - um
20:38 - we're going to commit this
21:01 - you
21:22 - all right so that should push
21:23 - unfortunately everything's really slow
21:26 - uh but this should push up to our test
21:27 - branch
21:29 - great that's done that now
21:32 - we can
21:35 - pull this change in
21:37 - uh right into our plugins folder
21:40 - uh if we ssh into
21:44 - that that droplet that we had so
21:47 - [Music]
21:49 - did i close it
21:51 - all right
21:52 - i have to
21:53 - log into digitalocean again
21:57 - hopefully it didn't sign me out yet
22:00 - i have to go into digital ocean and just
22:01 - grab the ip address
22:03 - and then we'll go in and and pull the
22:05 - changes in
22:16 - all right with the other plugin we
22:17 - didn't bother to do that we would just
22:18 - copy and paste it because we had one
22:22 - file
22:23 - right copying and pasting one file is
22:25 - not a big deal you just copy everything
22:27 - and paste ever you know rewrite
22:29 - everything
22:30 - but with this plugin you know we have
22:32 - multiple folders and files
22:35 - in this particular case we only change
22:37 - one piece of it
22:39 - but if we're making major changes this
22:41 - is definitely the better way to go
22:43 - uh because you don't want to have to be
22:45 - copying and pasting a bunch of stuff and
22:48 - um
22:50 - yeah there's much
22:51 - much more potential for missing
22:54 - something
22:57 - all right and good news is i was still
23:00 - signed into digitalocean
23:03 - so i should be able to just go right in
23:05 - here
23:16 - yeah and i know
23:18 - i sign in with root not the best thing
23:21 - standard underfunded terminal psp slow
23:23 - in your computer
23:25 - dom based renderers may improve
23:26 - performance
23:29 - uh sure
23:31 - improve performance would be good okay
23:34 - so
23:35 - now let's just go
23:36 - [Music]
23:38 - back
23:39 - a bit
23:40 - and then we should be able to go into
23:43 - um
23:46 - [Music]
23:47 - www.html
23:51 - um
23:58 - wp
24:00 - content
24:01 - and then
24:02 - plugins and from plugins it'll be
24:06 - wp
24:08 - graphql
24:10 - acf
24:12 - nice all right cool
24:20 - all right so it's probably covered oh no
24:23 - it's you can still see the whole path so
24:27 - i was able to remember the path uh since
24:29 - i had
24:30 - just recently gone there
24:33 - so now that we're in here we can do a
24:35 - get
24:36 - pull
24:39 - all right and now we have the changes
24:41 - that we've made
24:43 - and
24:44 - next step is just to check out
24:47 - first of all we're going to check out
24:48 - wordpress
24:50 - um
24:51 - because we'll know right off the bat if
24:53 - we mess something up badly
24:55 - it just won't even work anymore
25:05 - page isn't working all right cool
25:12 - alright so we can verify that this in
25:14 - fact was our fault if we go let's do um
25:17 - get
25:19 - check out
25:22 - master
25:25 - and now let's try again
25:40 - it's slow but all right it's working now
25:42 - all right so the change that we just
25:44 - made
25:46 - has
25:49 - um
25:53 - has broken
25:55 - wordpress
25:56 - all right
26:01 - i'm not exactly sure what in here broke
26:04 - it
26:08 - probably this from getting in a red line
26:11 - syntax error
26:14 - unexpected
26:15 - all right
26:23 - why are they expecting another
26:26 - uh you know what i probably messed it up
26:28 - when i copy and pasted it
26:30 - so
26:32 - one two three four
26:36 - that's matched
26:38 - um
26:44 - oh
26:45 - fields project label
26:48 - why is it like that
26:52 - all right let's go back and look here it
26:54 - shouldn't be like that right
27:01 - oh i copied too much
27:03 - okay
27:05 - all right so
27:07 - i
27:08 - yeah i definitely copied too much and
27:09 - try to paste it in here
27:11 - so let me
27:18 - let me double check make sure i'm doing
27:20 - this right okay so i just need to take
27:22 - out
27:24 - this
27:32 - let's make sure
27:44 - all right so this should this should
27:46 - work
27:46 - now uh let me save it
27:49 - see if it
27:51 - [ __ ] there we go all right it went away
27:54 - all right so that was the problem copy
27:56 - and paste error on my part uh apologies
27:59 - if one of you uh in the live chat caught
28:01 - that and tried to warn me
28:03 - um
28:08 - all right yeah maybe now i'm gonna check
28:10 - the live chat just to see if anybody's
28:12 - caught anything else
28:21 - okay christian um
28:24 - said
28:26 - clarified uh
28:27 - an earlier question um says well you
28:30 - want to add some functionality to the wp
28:32 - graphql plugin how do you review the
28:34 - plugin and find out how it works oh um
28:37 - basically i just i looked at the files i
28:39 - read through the files um
28:44 - i'm i'm
28:45 - not going to claim that i know how it
28:47 - all works but
28:50 - was able to
28:51 - kind of get the basic flow of
28:54 - what was happening
28:55 - i'm not
28:59 - i'm not great with php
29:01 - but i'm familiar enough with the syntax
29:04 - that i can kind of tell what's going on
29:07 - so
29:08 - that's that's what i mean by review
29:10 - plug-in
29:17 - oh john said we need to screen capture
29:19 - that long long frozen yawn oh i can't
29:22 - believe it froze on that part
29:25 - oh no christian says there are big
29:26 - issues with the stream today
29:30 - ah what else what can i close
29:37 - did it start getting worse when i um
29:41 - when i went into this uh digital ocean
29:44 - droplet
29:46 - so i don't really know what else i i
29:48 - would have done that
29:51 - would have made it worse
29:54 - all right well let me
29:58 - actually you know what what i'm doing a
29:59 - lot with get
30:01 - it does slow things down
30:04 - so that could could also be a problem
30:11 - all right so i'm going to save this
30:20 - verify that this saved
30:24 - git commit
30:43 - and then once that goes up
30:45 - i'll just pull it down and then go back
30:47 - to the test branch to see if it
