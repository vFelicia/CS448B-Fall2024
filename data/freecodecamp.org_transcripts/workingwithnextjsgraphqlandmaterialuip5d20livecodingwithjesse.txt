00:05 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:07 - with jesse i'm jesse and today we're
00:10 - going to do all kind of stuff uh so i
00:12 - gave it a very title this video a very
00:16 - vague
00:17 - name
00:18 - because we got a lot of stuff to do
00:22 - i wasn't sure what we were going to get
00:23 - done we're going to have time to do so
00:26 - let's just start out
00:28 - i want to give you some updates
00:30 - we
00:33 - we now have
00:34 - a lot of issues open
00:36 - i set up a project like a kanban board
00:40 - uh within the github repo
00:42 - let me
00:44 - let me switch over
00:46 - and so i can show you what i'm talking
00:48 - about
00:51 - so i started a project here we have
00:55 - a bunch of cards now with issues
00:58 - i can make a card quickly convert it
01:01 - into an issue
01:03 - and then once that issue
01:06 - uh
01:09 - i'm not sure i think once the issue is
01:11 - opened or something it goes to in
01:12 - progress and then once it's completed
01:16 - it goes to done automatically which is
01:18 - kind of cool
01:19 - if you haven't used this yet just click
01:20 - on the projects tab on your github
01:24 - repo and
01:27 - if you select the automated uh
01:29 - kanban board it sets up a lot of it for
01:32 - you
01:33 - it gives you some
01:35 - some different steps
01:37 - to do
01:38 - um searching that issue to pr so
01:43 - we've done some of these but anyway
01:45 - i've used this on a previous project
01:47 - before i thought i'd set it up
01:49 - so we now have a lot of issues if you
01:50 - want to
01:52 - you know contribute these are broken
01:54 - down into most of them are very simple
01:57 - tasks very small things so
01:59 - uh have at it
02:01 - we may actually fix some of these
02:03 - uh
02:05 - today uh we'll see how it goes
02:09 - so i'm gonna move this back over we
02:10 - don't need it right now
02:22 - right
02:24 - hey everybody i see some
02:26 - some highs there in the live chat
02:30 - hopefully uh let me know if you all got
02:32 - the notification on youtube
02:34 - uh because yesterday
02:37 - i got my notification
02:39 - after i had already ended the stream
02:42 - so
02:44 - all right it looks like i did get a
02:45 - notification on my phone
02:48 - two minutes ago
02:49 - so i did
02:50 - i didn't get the earlier notification
02:52 - like usually happens so
02:55 - anyway sometimes i think it depends on
02:58 - how late in the day i schedule this
03:01 - all right so on the screen right now we
03:03 - can see you know this is basically where
03:04 - we left off at
03:06 - yesterday
03:08 - and
03:10 - i want to show you some of what i've
03:11 - been working on
03:13 - oh before i forget i have a new video up
03:15 - on my youtube channel so check i think i
03:18 - have a link in the description to my
03:19 - channel check it out it's my video
03:22 - review of the
03:24 - react nanodegree
03:26 - program so i know i said that that video
03:28 - was going to be coming months ago
03:31 - and
03:32 - i finally did it so it's there it's
03:35 - short video you know less than 10
03:37 - minutes uh just some of my thoughts on
03:39 - the nanodegree program which i've
03:41 - already shared a lot of it with you all
03:42 - in the in the stream but
03:44 - now there's a short video
03:46 - uh
03:47 - where everything's kind of summed up
03:50 - so if you haven't done the program yet
03:51 - you're thinking about it you know maybe
03:53 - it'll
03:54 - help you make your decision
03:59 - so what i've been working on
04:02 - let's go to our
04:03 - microsoft
04:05 - there we go
04:06 - our sequel
04:09 - i always remember forget the name of
04:11 - this sql operations studio i think
04:13 - that's it we're going to go to sql
04:15 - operation studio here i'm going to show
04:17 - you what i've been looking at
04:19 - so i keep going through this is our
04:22 - database
04:24 - just for everybody that hasn't been
04:25 - following since the beginning of this
04:26 - project
04:27 - just to catch you all up
04:29 - we have a database right now for the
04:32 - current university website
04:34 - that's a sql server database
04:38 - and
04:41 - we're using a content management system
04:43 - called ektron which is pretty outdated
04:45 - the company doesn't even exist anymore
04:48 - so
04:50 - we want to move all the data out and we
04:52 - want to automate as much as possible we
04:54 - want to avoid having to copy and paste
04:56 - things
04:56 - so
04:57 - we're moving out we're not just dumping
04:59 - it all we're moving it out section by
05:01 - section
05:02 - we're using the wordpress api to put the
05:05 - data in
05:06 - to a
05:08 - my sql database
05:10 - and then users you know administrators
05:13 - will be able to edit things through a
05:15 - wordpress admin panel but we won't
05:18 - really mess that much with wordpress the
05:20 - site the public facing site but that
05:23 - users will see
05:24 - is going to be a react site and we're
05:26 - going to get the data from graphql so
05:29 - right now the step that i'm working on
05:31 - is
05:32 - checking out the data seeing what info
05:34 - we have and then i'm going to
05:37 - move it all over to wordpress
05:40 - it's going to be slightly different than
05:42 - the way we've done this with some other
05:43 - pieces of data
05:45 - so these are all news articles
05:50 - and they go back for for years
05:53 - i want to bring them all over so we have
05:55 - a nice archive
05:58 - but what i'd like to do
06:01 - is
06:03 - keep
06:03 - the
06:05 - publish date
06:07 - and make that the publish date for for
06:09 - in wordpress i think that'll be really
06:11 - useful
06:14 - in fact i mean that's necessary right
06:16 - there'll be no context at all for when
06:18 - these things were posted or how relevant
06:20 - they are anymore unless we bring the
06:22 - data over somehow
06:24 - so
06:25 - the last thing i was trying to do
06:27 - was
06:28 - figure out what format i need the date
06:30 - to be in
06:32 - in the wordpress api
06:35 - and i just had that info up here so let
06:37 - me move this over
06:39 - so we don't have to go through too many
06:42 - screens
06:43 - so we can add the date in here um let's
06:47 - see
06:53 - string daytime iso 8601 okay so
06:59 - what i was thinking
07:04 - might be the easiest way to figure out
07:06 - so like this iso 8601 that doesn't mean
07:10 - anything to me right now i need to see
07:11 - what the date actually looks like
07:14 - uh
07:15 - so i'm going to check out the api and
07:17 - see what the api gives us when we want
07:20 - to see a
07:21 - a publish date
07:23 - let me start my pomodoro timer
07:26 - and
07:29 - we're going to work on this for 25
07:31 - minutes and i'm going to have minimal
07:33 - interaction with the live chat i'll
07:35 - glance at it occasionally
07:37 - then i'm going to take five minutes and
07:39 - it's i'm just going to go to live chat
07:41 - check out your comments answer any
07:42 - questions we'll go back and do some more
07:44 - work
07:45 - and we'll just kind of go back and forth
07:47 - and see how things go i want to get at
07:49 - least two
07:50 - 25-minute sessions of work on the
07:53 - project at the end of that i'll answer
07:55 - any remaining questions i'll read out
07:57 - comments
07:58 - so
07:59 - you know whatever questions you might
08:01 - have for me
08:02 - go ahead and put them in the in the live
08:04 - chat and
08:06 - please be patient i will get to them
08:12 - all right so let's go with one
08:16 - exactly
08:19 - all right this works
08:22 - all right so our date
08:26 - is going to be in this format
08:27 - [Music]
08:32 - this is going to be tricky
08:35 - a little bit tricky
08:39 - all right so here's what we have
08:41 - in in terms of a date
08:46 - and i'm showing all the data here
08:48 - because i just wanted to see what was
08:49 - available
08:50 - normally we would want to instead of an
08:52 - asterisk here for the the query
08:55 - we would want to you know narrow it down
08:57 - so we didn't have all this stuff and
08:59 - when we import it we're not going to
09:00 - import everything we're just going to
09:01 - import a few things
09:03 - but we have a date created we have an
09:06 - edit date i don't think we have a
09:09 - publish date
09:18 - last quarter yeah we don't have a
09:19 - published date
09:20 - so i think
09:22 - we're gonna have to go with day created
09:26 - last edit
09:33 - 2014.
09:36 - this is kind of odd this was created in
09:38 - 2014 but it was edited
09:41 - in 2016.
09:45 - that's pretty wild
09:51 - all right i mean i i think still date
09:53 - created has got to be the
09:57 - the way to go
10:01 - so let's go with that we'll bring in
10:03 - date created
10:06 - and we'll set that as the date so let me
10:09 - see what format
10:12 - oh
10:19 - 620
10:24 - i'm not sure about that format there
10:26 - is this what we want
10:30 - 1956
10:38 - nah that that does not match up
10:42 - all right so we're gonna have to do some
10:43 - manipulating of this day created value
10:48 - the other thing that we're going to have
10:50 - to deal with
10:51 - is
10:55 - this title
10:57 - so we've been using the titles as the
11:00 - slugs
11:01 - for our our posts
11:04 - and
11:06 - we um
11:09 - let's see
11:12 - we were manipulating that a little bit
11:14 - so that it matched up with the current
11:16 - site i don't think we're going to be
11:18 - able to match things up with the current
11:20 - site
11:21 - for all of these news uh articles
11:25 - i've been looking at some of them and
11:27 - the
11:29 - the urls
11:31 - don't match with the titles
11:34 - and they're not here in the database so
11:37 - i'm not sure where they're stored or how
11:39 - to get those or match them up so i'm not
11:42 - going to try we're just going to have to
11:44 - live with that we're going to break some
11:45 - links
11:48 - i don't
11:50 - i don't really see any way around that
11:52 - other than having somebody go through
11:54 - all of these and and change things
11:57 - uh change the slug on wordpress manually
12:02 - i mean i
12:04 - if i find somebody that wants to do that
12:06 - then that's okay but i'm not gonna
12:09 - i'm not gonna try that's just not a good
12:11 - use of of our time
12:14 - you know we have other things to to work
12:16 - on for this site
12:18 - um
12:20 - i just glanced at the live chat
12:22 - uh david says remind yourself that
12:25 - overconfidence is a slow and insidious
12:28 - killer
12:30 - all right
12:31 - good advice
12:33 - good advice i'm not sure where that came
12:35 - from
12:37 - am i coming off as really confident
12:39 - today i don't know
12:44 - uh let's see
12:58 - all right let's go to
13:05 - where we have our
13:09 - is this it there we go okay so we're
13:12 - going to have to change our
13:13 - migrate.js
13:15 - and let's put this right beside
13:18 - our sql operations studio
13:21 - screen
13:23 - so here's where we've been importing
13:24 - things
13:26 - uh here's where we put our query
13:29 - all right so i do have date created and
13:31 - i'm also pulling in the content teaser
13:34 - and we're going to make this the excerpt
13:37 - for
13:38 - the post i think it'll be useful to
13:40 - bring in that same excerpt
13:43 - and then we can try to use that as well
13:47 - if we have
13:48 - you know like a small view maybe on the
13:50 - front page of the website
13:52 - before you can click to get the full
13:53 - content
13:55 - so
13:56 - this query should give us all the info
13:59 - we need
14:01 - now we need to change
14:04 - a bit here right so
14:11 - so right now we're saying name equals
14:13 - post content title
14:15 - that's because we originally made this
14:17 - when we were bringing over the data for
14:19 - faculty members
14:21 - probably be more straightforward just to
14:22 - keep this as title but for now i'm going
14:24 - to leave it
14:25 - but here's what we we do have that i
14:27 - think we ought to get rid of
14:30 - in here we are checking for
14:35 - uh titles
14:37 - in the
14:39 - in the slugs
14:41 - so
14:42 - like
14:43 - doctor you know things like that
14:46 - we didn't want them to keep the urls the
14:48 - same we had to get rid of them but we
14:50 - don't want to do that for here for one
14:52 - thing we're not worried about keeping
14:54 - the urls the same for you know for
14:56 - another thing
14:57 - we would actually want those words in
14:59 - these titles alright so we're gonna just
15:01 - comment this out for now
15:05 - and what we still want is to make
15:07 - everything lower case
15:08 - and to replace spaces
15:11 - with hyphens
15:13 - all right so
15:16 - uh that should make sense
15:18 - we'll bring everything over
15:21 - we will need to add
15:28 - let's add a
15:33 - excerpt
15:35 - you know let's check out the api
15:37 - documentation
15:38 - and make sure
15:40 - we can add in an excerpt
15:48 - there we go excerpt
15:58 - so we're going to bring in post dots
16:03 - we call
16:06 - that content teaser
16:20 - all right
16:25 - so the only thing we have left that we
16:27 - do want to bring in is that date
16:32 - so let's figure out how we can adjust
16:34 - this date properly
16:39 - let's look up
16:48 - our date format
16:51 - trying to find
16:53 - mdn
17:02 - all right so this is the format that we
17:04 - want
17:16 - i'm gonna sorry i i know this is boring
17:19 - on the stream but i'm gonna have to look
17:20 - at this just a bit
17:22 - um
17:26 - we need this date to work
17:32 - is
17:55 - all right let's do some testing
17:59 - all right so let me just grab a date in
18:01 - this format can i copy this
18:04 - copy
18:06 - and
18:07 - let's open up
18:10 - dev
18:12 - tools and
18:15 - let's do
18:17 - i don't know uh
18:19 - well let's let's make this bigger
18:22 - and go to console
18:24 - let's get rid of this stuff and let's
18:27 - say um
18:29 - let
18:30 - new
18:32 - let
18:33 - um
18:34 - test date equal
18:39 - new
18:40 - date
18:41 - and
18:43 - let's put that in
18:55 - test this
19:04 - okay
19:06 - all right so we can
19:08 - take this date in and this this date
19:10 - works
19:12 - for
19:13 - the javascript uh date
19:17 - but
19:18 - this is still not what we want so let's
19:20 - see about that iso
19:24 - format um let's see if we can
19:28 - parse
19:29 - string representation of date returns
19:54 - all right there we go
19:56 - uh let's go
19:59 - let's check this one out
20:02 - this looks like what we need
20:04 - new date right and
20:08 - events dot to
20:11 - iso string
20:12 - all right let's try it out
20:14 - um
20:16 - oh yeah
20:18 - oh no let's see if we can get that back
20:22 - there we go
20:24 - um
20:24 - and let's see
20:27 - let's iso date equal
20:30 - [Music]
20:32 - test date
20:34 - dots
20:36 - to
20:37 - iso string
20:41 - and then
20:43 - iso
20:44 - date is
20:56 - alright that looks like what we need
21:00 - let's just double check to verify
21:04 - yep
21:05 - that looks like what we need all right
21:07 - cool so
21:09 - um
21:10 - we can
21:12 - manipulate
21:14 - um manipulate the date to get what we
21:17 - want so let's take what we've done here
21:19 - and put it into
21:22 - our migrate
21:24 - dot js
21:26 - looks like there is there's some
21:27 - confusion in the live chat so let me
21:28 - just take a second to clarify what's
21:30 - going on
21:32 - all right so um
21:35 - peter welcome back i did switch to
21:37 - visual studio
21:39 - um
21:40 - everybody kept recommending it it was
21:42 - fast so i thought let's try it out
21:44 - uh stephenmigrate.js
21:47 - is
21:49 - um
21:50 - just a it's a little bit of node
21:53 - uh script so a little bit of javascript
21:55 - that's helping us take data out of
21:58 - one database
22:01 - kind of convert the data into a format
22:03 - that we we want and then sending that
22:05 - into a different database through
22:08 - wordpress so that's all we're doing here
22:11 - we can
22:14 - do we have this on github
22:16 - i'm not sure if i have this repository
22:18 - on github it was on github originally
22:23 - i haven't really been syncing things up
22:25 - because we
22:26 - frequently change this
22:29 - um so
22:32 - anyway that but that's all that we're
22:33 - doing here
22:35 - and
22:36 - claus says uh black screen so is anybody
22:40 - else having problems with the screen
22:42 - being black
22:45 - on my end let's see
22:47 - everything
22:49 - is saying it's good on my end so just uh
22:52 - let me know
22:56 - all right so let's let's do some
23:00 - some work on this date here
23:02 - so let's say
23:07 - um
23:10 - iso dates
23:13 - let's see how much we could put in line
23:15 - here whoops
23:19 - iso date equals
23:24 - post
23:28 - new
23:31 - date
23:33 - and this is going to be post dot
23:39 - date created
23:44 - and then we're going to go
23:47 - to
23:48 - iso string
23:51 - all right not sure if that'll all work
23:52 - in line like that but let's let's try it
23:55 - out and then
23:57 - let's um
24:05 - i guess let's just try it
24:09 - let's try it in the
24:11 - console first
24:13 - because i don't want to run this
24:15 - and
24:17 - have it transfer over bad data
24:22 - so let's just grab
24:24 - this and
24:26 - we can take this date this test date
24:31 - and
24:32 - put it in here
24:36 - and let's change this to iso date
24:39 - 2.
24:48 - okay so that does what we wanted to it
24:49 - should work awesome
24:56 - all right so just to um
25:00 - just kind of recap what we're doing
25:02 - we're taking the date in one format
25:04 - which is
25:05 - a different format that we need
25:07 - and we're making a variable here
25:09 - constant
25:11 - we're getting that date and we're making
25:13 - it into you know like a javascript date
25:15 - what do you call this a date object
25:18 - i don't know what the correct term would
25:19 - be for that but
25:21 - uh then we're taking that and we're
25:23 - converting that
25:25 - uh to iso string so it's iso
25:28 - i forget already what it was
25:31 - um
25:33 - iso 8601 format which is what we need
25:38 - and
25:39 - then we're going to take that
25:41 - and
25:42 - we're going to add that in as the date
25:46 - so the date will be iso
25:50 - dates
25:55 - and i'm going to verify that date is
25:57 - what we want here so let's check the
26:00 - docs
26:03 - and it is date
26:05 - we want a date and it is a string iso
26:07 - format great all right so everything
26:11 - should work
26:14 - um
26:17 - let me check my time
26:19 - all right six minutes cool uh claus in
26:22 - about six minutes i'm gonna take a break
26:24 - and i'm gonna go to live chat and
26:25 - explain things so if you can hold on for
26:27 - a few more minutes i'll explain um i'll
26:30 - explain everything uh just
26:32 - to give you something for now
26:35 - this is a project that i'm doing for my
26:37 - job as a front-end developer and we're
26:38 - just kind of working through it live
26:40 - together
26:41 - uh so
26:42 - that's the
26:44 - like big picture of of what uh what is
26:46 - going on here also uh welcome uh thanks
26:49 - for for watching
26:52 - all right so let me give it one look
26:54 - through
26:55 - just to make sure
26:57 - we're doing the right thing
26:59 - so we're getting content id
27:02 - title
27:03 - uh the actual content html date created
27:07 - content teaser
27:08 - good
27:09 - from folder id 89 and we want to this
27:12 - data length uh here we're saying we we
27:15 - don't want
27:16 - content that has no
27:18 - no data
27:25 - cost url
27:27 - directory
27:28 - oh i'm glad i checked this right we
27:30 - don't want this to be in directory we
27:33 - want it to be in news
27:36 - and i don't know if we've actually
27:37 - created that custom post type yet
27:40 - that that would have been a huge problem
27:42 - if i had just let that go through
27:46 - um
27:48 - there we go so who was that at the
27:49 - beginning to talk about overcon so david
27:52 - thank you for bringing up overconfidence
27:54 - because if i had been overconfident i
27:56 - would have just
27:57 - um
27:58 - hit enter on that thing and ran it and
28:01 - would have messed things up
28:04 - all right so it's so easy even when
28:06 - you're not live streaming it's so easy
28:09 - to make a little mistake like that
28:12 - and i've i've certainly made plenty of
28:14 - them on the live stream but you know
28:16 - also
28:17 - when i'm not streaming make little
28:19 - mistakes
28:21 - all right
28:25 - that looks good now what we need to do
28:27 - is make a post type that's news
28:34 - so let's go with whoops here's our post
28:36 - type
28:37 - so this is just a php file that is in
28:40 - the proper format to be a wordpress
28:42 - plugin so we're going to edit this a bit
28:46 - see what we have
28:48 - directory directory is factory
28:51 - all right so
28:54 - let's
28:56 - copy
29:05 - oh i want to make sure i only copy what
29:07 - i should be copying okay
29:09 - uh let's just copy this and paste it and
29:12 - then we'll change what we need to to
29:13 - make a new
29:16 - news
29:18 - custom post type
29:21 - so we don't normally use php on this
29:24 - stream but occasionally
29:26 - we
29:30 - we do need to use it
29:32 - mostly just when we're working with
29:33 - wordpress
29:34 - so first of all let's just change the
29:36 - word directory
29:40 - where we find it oops you know what i
29:42 - don't want to go down that far because
29:44 - i want to keep the uppercase stuff
29:46 - uppercase
29:47 - so directory let's say
30:01 - all right that's fine it's a little bit
30:02 - awkward to say add new news or something
30:04 - like that but
30:07 - i i'd rather keep it short than say
30:09 - something like news story or news item
30:11 - or something
30:12 - uh it's just easier to work with one
30:14 - word
30:16 - now we have
30:22 - i guess the
30:24 - singular and plural for news
30:28 - is the same right
30:39 - i mean it is right i'm not going crazy
30:41 - there is it's just news whether it's
30:43 - singular plural there's no we don't say
30:45 - news is right
30:49 - all right so let's just say
30:52 - news
30:53 - and then
30:57 - for directory
31:00 - news
31:02 - and then one more for directories we'll
31:05 - change it to news
31:08 - all right so just really quickly uh
31:10 - what's going on uh this part
31:13 - is
31:15 - uh basically saying how do we want this
31:17 - to appear in the wordpress admin panel
31:20 - so these are all the labels that a user
31:22 - would see if they were going in to edit
31:24 - the post through that admin panel down
31:27 - here is more of how is this going to
31:30 - appear and act
31:31 - you know kind of in the back end in the
31:33 - api with graphql
31:35 - you know things like that
31:37 - so
31:38 - that's why we're kind of saying like
31:40 - well what things does this support and
31:42 - thumbnail excerpt editor title
31:46 - yeah this looks good
31:48 - um
31:54 - we do want to exclude from search
31:55 - capability type post
31:58 - sluggish news we want to show
32:00 - this is going to show it in the rest api
32:02 - but then also it's going to show it in
32:04 - the graphql
32:06 - um
32:08 - that so we're using a graph wp graphql
32:10 - plugin that's good that basically lets
32:12 - us use graphql with wordpress
32:14 - that's how we're going to grab it from
32:16 - from this news here
32:18 - let's save that and let's copy it and
32:21 - my timer's up
32:25 - all right so my timer is up
32:28 - so
32:29 - we'll have some suspense now here
32:31 - when we come back from the five minute
32:33 - break
32:34 - then we will update our plug-in and try
32:37 - to pull in all this data
32:39 - all right this is gonna be a lot of data
32:41 - we're pulling in at once so if we mess
32:42 - it up
32:43 - we have to go in and try to delete it
32:45 - all and redo it so i'm a little bit
32:48 - nervous about this one
32:51 - we've doubled and triple checked
32:52 - everything so i think it'll be okay
32:55 - but
32:57 - rather not mess up that much data so let
33:00 - me take a short break here and go to the
33:01 - live chat and answer some questions
33:05 - it looks like we've got a few more
33:06 - viewers here
33:08 - in the last few minutes so hey everyone
33:10 - thanks for watching feel free to ask any
33:12 - questions
33:13 - in the live chat
33:24 - all right so um
33:26 - claus
33:30 - had asked a few minutes ago
33:32 - um for an explanation of what's going on
33:34 - because it was the first time you know
33:36 - seeing it so
33:40 - um
33:41 - this is so to start from from the
33:43 - beginning
33:44 - this is a project that i am doing for
33:46 - work i'm a front-end developer and so
33:49 - this is a real-life project we're
33:51 - working on it's a react
33:55 - basically it's it's
33:57 - react combined with a wordpress backend
34:01 - so
34:02 - data is going to be
34:04 - put into wordpress
34:07 - you know from the admin panel at some
34:09 - point right now we're kind of doing a
34:10 - programmatic way uh but later on people
34:14 - will be able to edit this site
34:17 - then we'll pull that data with graphql
34:20 - into our
34:21 - react app and it will be displayed there
34:24 - so we're doing a little bit everything
34:25 - in this project some streams we do like
34:27 - user interface work
34:29 - um
34:30 - sometimes we're building react
34:32 - components
34:33 - uh we're working on pulling in data from
34:35 - our api
34:36 - uh other times like now we're working on
34:39 - you know wordpress plugins post type
34:42 - database things
34:43 - so there's a lot that's going into it
34:45 - later on we'll get into setting up our
34:47 - servers uh there's we're still
34:50 - considering the options in terms of how
34:54 - to set up the servers and what to use
34:58 - but we're going to have to do all that
35:01 - um so that's the project that's what
35:03 - we're doing so today specifically we're
35:04 - pretty much just working with data
35:07 - if we get all the data over and we have
35:09 - time maybe we'll we'll worry about
35:11 - like building out
35:13 - a new react component and um maybe like
35:18 - doing some really basic styling of that
35:21 - and as a follow-up
35:24 - clause says so wordpress site build with
35:26 - react
35:27 - yeah so kind of so i would say um it's a
35:30 - react site
35:32 - but we're pulling in data
35:35 - from
35:36 - uh wordpress
35:38 - right so that's going to be one of the
35:40 - places we pull in data we may end up
35:41 - pulling in data from multiple sources
35:44 - for now most of the data is going into
35:47 - wordpress and that's basically it's just
35:50 - wordpress is reliable there's a big
35:52 - community and
35:54 - a lot of people know how to work with it
35:56 - it's going to be user friendly for the
35:57 - people that need to edit the data that
35:59 - don't necessarily know anything about
36:01 - coding
36:03 - all right so hopefully that was a decent
36:05 - explanation you can always go back and
36:07 - check some of the previous streams if
36:09 - you want to know more i think the first
36:11 - stream i i went in more depth into
36:12 - explaining everything
36:15 - uh let's see
36:16 - [Music]
36:18 - ghost sniper says i hate coding and
36:20 - it'll never help me in life and my
36:22 - school makes me do it
36:27 - i don't know i guess it depends right if
36:29 - if you if you never use a computer again
36:32 - i don't know maybe it won't help that
36:33 - much uh but you know it does teach some
36:36 - concepts that could be helpful
36:38 - uh so
36:41 - school makes you learn a lot of stuff
36:42 - you probably don't want to do i know it
36:44 - did for me and uh there is honestly a
36:47 - lot of stuff that i learned in school
36:48 - that i haven't ever used and i probably
36:50 - won't ever use right i learned how to
36:52 - square dance in school i've never square
36:54 - danced before i've never square danced
36:56 - after that
36:56 - ever
36:57 - so
36:59 - totally
37:00 - totally not needed
37:02 - i took acting classes in school for a
37:05 - couple years and i'm not an actor right
37:08 - so
37:09 - i don't know
37:10 - it is what it is but
37:14 - um
37:16 - i guess all you can do is control how
37:18 - you react to being able to having to
37:21 - learn how to code you can control your
37:23 - attitude and how you feel about it
37:25 - uh
37:26 - so try to make the best of it
37:28 - and to be honest you can make a ton of
37:30 - money coding at some point so it's it's
37:32 - not so bad that you're learning it
37:36 - um
37:37 - let's see
37:39 - including one more question john hanson
37:42 - says anyone having a hard time
37:43 - understanding event dot stop propagation
37:46 - uh in create react app i am is it a best
37:50 - practice to use it to stop a parent
37:52 - event listener to add this onto all
37:55 - children objects with events
38:01 - i'm
38:03 - i'm a little bit
38:05 - interested
38:08 - i'd be interested to let me see some of
38:10 - the code so
38:13 - i'm i'm just wondering about
38:16 - using like event stop propagation
38:19 - is that the best way to do it in react
38:25 - i'm i'm not sure um
38:28 - i personally haven't used it in anything
38:30 - with react
38:32 - so i don't know that i could give a good
38:33 - answer for that but
38:36 - i would be interested to see if there is
38:37 - maybe a unique react type of way to
38:40 - handle that and do something like that
38:42 - that would make things easier
38:46 - uh but sorry john i just can't i don't
38:48 - have experience with it uh
38:51 - so
38:52 - hope maybe somebody else knows uh if
38:54 - anybody that's uh listening right now or
38:56 - watching
38:57 - uh knows about um
39:00 - stopping event propagation
39:03 - with react
39:04 - uh please um
39:07 - share your knowledge uh in the live chat
39:11 - all right so i didn't get through all
39:13 - the questions on live chat but i will
39:15 - come back to the live chat
39:18 - after we uh
39:20 - do a bit more with our data
39:30 - all right
39:31 - i had to write down what question i left
39:33 - off with so i remember later on
39:37 - all right let's restart our timer
39:40 - and now
39:43 - all that's left to do
39:44 - is
39:45 - move this into our wordpress
39:46 - installation our plugin right let's
39:48 - update our plugin
39:50 - and
39:53 - we'll move that data over we'll run our
39:55 - our node program here our uh migrate.js
39:59 - and see if it works
40:01 - so where's
40:03 - i thought i was logged in
40:06 - i am i'm logged in here
40:10 - all right so we go to our plugins to our
40:13 - editor
40:15 - and we can select our
40:18 - our custom types plugin that we've
40:20 - created
40:23 - and now
40:25 - we'll paste it
40:28 - and
40:29 - update the file
40:32 - cool
40:34 - all right no weird errors when we did
40:36 - that
40:39 - and let's
40:42 - you know what let's double check
40:48 - there we are okay just wanted to make
40:51 - sure we did in fact have news let's make
40:53 - sure that we have a title
40:55 - excerpt featured image wonderful
40:59 - all right
41:01 - so don't really want to add a new one
41:03 - so once we transfer this data we should
41:05 - be able to see a ton of news items here
41:09 - news posts
41:10 - so let's do that now
41:12 - let me make sure i'm on the right
41:14 - network okay i'm on the right network
41:18 - i can only access the database from one
41:21 - uh network
41:23 - and
41:24 - write ip address and everything so
41:27 - i know i talked about making copy of the
41:29 - database to get around that i just i
41:31 - never did it so
41:32 - still probably a good idea to do
41:38 - all right
41:39 - so
41:41 - let's see
41:45 - uh it's not
41:47 - i was hoping it would save it
41:49 - um
41:54 - let's go
42:16 - let's see what did we get a range error
42:36 - hmm
42:38 - all right let's see what happened
42:40 - check this out first
42:41 - verify that nothing came through right
42:43 - nothing came through
42:45 - we have some sort of error here
42:49 - so let's check it out
42:53 - oh no promise rejection warning
42:55 - objection 21 ranger invalid time value
43:12 - hmm
43:20 - let's see
43:28 - all right uh
43:30 - the iso date
43:32 - your data is a string literal not the
43:34 - date string
43:37 - all right so my data coming through
43:42 - is not what we want to put in there is
43:44 - that correct
44:06 - let me see
44:20 - oh
44:23 - i see now rook thank you thank you i
44:26 - can't believe i did that
44:27 - all right
44:29 - thanks for catching that
44:31 - um
44:32 - we even checked how many times did we
44:34 - check and i still missed it all right
44:36 - yeah so
44:38 - i was trying to pass in a string
44:41 - that said post dot date underscore
44:44 - created instead of actually the the
44:46 - variable the value
44:48 - thankfully it didn't actually go through
44:51 - and it was rejected by wordpress or that
44:54 - that could have been a mess
44:57 - all right
44:58 - so rook is the hero of the day
45:01 - thank you again
45:03 - let's stop this program now
45:05 - and rerun it
45:16 - whoa there we go
45:18 - it's inserting a lot of posts
45:28 - i've always been interested in like how
45:30 - many posts i could insert at once
45:33 - i'm gonna find out now because i think
45:35 - this is the largest
45:37 - uh block the largest content type
45:41 - that we will
45:43 - have to bring over so if this works i
45:46 - don't have any worries about anything
45:47 - else
45:52 - all right slowing down a little bit
45:56 - whoa
45:58 - did y'all see that jump
46:00 - it was frozen for a second and then
46:03 - all of a sudden it just jumped from 400
46:06 - to 500.
46:13 - all right we'll let it let it do its
46:15 - thing
46:22 - and if i
46:27 - at one time at one point i had thought
46:30 - about putting a delay
46:33 - and i don't know if we ever did that
46:37 - um like a delay between attempts to add
46:40 - things
47:04 - maybe it finished
47:10 - it's possible that it finished
47:13 - uh 546 rows 546 it did all right cool we
47:17 - finished i'm here i am waiting and
47:20 - nothing
47:21 - because it finished all right
47:22 - cool let's check it out
47:26 - so here's the
47:28 - the big test
47:29 - let's see if it works
47:31 - oh there we are
47:33 - awesome
47:37 - very awesome
47:38 - [Music]
47:42 - so we have an excerpt
47:49 - weird format but still excerpts we have
47:53 - the html came through
47:55 - the title let's see the slug
47:59 - i'm really interested to see how the
48:00 - slug came through
48:05 - all right awesome that looks nice can't
48:07 - see scientists gather
48:09 - for the jubilee awesome oh
48:12 - whoa
48:13 - all right we have a little bit of a
48:15 - problem here
48:23 - uh
48:24 - all right i don't know if you'll see
48:26 - this
48:27 - uh it's really small let me zoom in a
48:29 - bit
48:31 - why is the slug field in wordpress this
48:33 - short anyway
48:36 - let's go over everything looks good
48:38 - until
48:46 - we get here and there are spaces in the
48:50 - middle of a word
48:52 - and
48:56 - a hyphen
48:58 - why why would we have that
49:03 - um
49:09 - let's see
49:10 - if this is stay created
49:23 - i mean what's up what do our titles look
49:25 - like
49:36 - all right let's see what we were doing
49:38 - here so
49:40 - all we're doing
49:51 - content title
49:53 - moving everything to lowercase
49:56 - and we're replacing spaces
50:04 - that's really odd
50:10 - i'm going to check just a few other
50:12 - posts
50:14 - just to see if i can find some
50:15 - similarity uh as to how this happened
50:18 - because
50:21 - i mean obviously we can see the title
50:23 - here
50:25 - oops
50:26 - you know it doesn't look like anything's
50:28 - wrong here with the title
50:30 - uh so let's just check a few more items
50:38 - and let's check
50:40 - insulation
50:45 - all right i'm just going through really
50:47 - quickly
50:52 - i might write a plug-in that makes this
50:55 - slug field larger that's just insane
50:59 - it really bugs me
51:02 - you all know i'm pretty easy going most
51:04 - of the time but that's like
51:07 - that's terrible
51:08 - like
51:10 - that's just a terrible ui
51:13 - anyway
51:14 - all right i didn't check to i didn't
51:17 - think to check the permalink to see if
51:19 - the same problem in the permalink which
51:21 - i think we would so let me go back to
51:23 - this one and see
51:26 - look at that so the with the permalink
51:28 - it doesn't have that problem
51:33 - that's really odd um
51:37 - let's see
51:40 - summer conference sessions
51:42 - so and these even have the same word in
51:45 - it so it's we still have the same word
51:46 - conference
51:47 - none of them have that problem all right
51:50 - i'm not going to worry about it right
51:51 - now
51:52 - um
51:53 - but
51:57 - what we're going to what i do want to
51:58 - double check is these publish dates to
52:01 - make sure
52:06 - six seventh ninth all right so we do
52:09 - have different dates
52:10 - wow
52:12 - 28 pages
52:13 - uh i want to go to the last page
52:18 - right awesome 2014 your details image
52:21 - news one
52:23 - all right so it did bring in just some
52:25 - some kind of nonsense uh posts
52:29 - we can clean that up later i'm not
52:30 - worried about it
52:32 - but
52:33 - this is really cool
52:35 - that's really cool we have all the stuff
52:37 - in all right so now we need to display
52:39 - it let me check my time
52:41 - all right 11 minutes let's go over to
52:43 - the react side of things
52:45 - and see if we can pull this data in so
52:47 - we'll need
52:49 - we need to make it a graphql query we'll
52:52 - have to do another one i know we did one
52:53 - yesterday we'll do one today it
52:55 - shouldn't be too hard we can probably
52:56 - copy and paste most of what we did
52:58 - yesterday if not everything uh and then
53:00 - we'll um
53:03 - we could probably reuse a lot of the
53:05 - same react component uh that we used
53:08 - yesterday as well and just change some
53:10 - of the names
53:11 - so we we may be able to do this in in 11
53:14 - minutes and i see there's
53:17 - some
53:21 - some comments in the live chat actually
53:23 - there's there's some pertinent comments
53:25 - here let me get to these
53:26 - um
53:28 - ed edward says it's not supposed to be
53:31 - like this did you delete the slug to
53:33 - create it it's gonna populate the field
53:35 - automatically
53:36 - um we let's see
53:39 - let me show you we're adding the slug in
53:42 - so
53:44 - i'm i'm adding the slug manually when we
53:47 - update these
53:48 - uh so the reason we were doing this
53:52 - you're actually right it would have made
53:53 - the slug automatically from the title
53:56 - that might have been a better way to go
54:02 - oh i'm not going to try to redo all that
54:04 - now
54:05 - but that probably would have been a
54:06 - better way to go the reason we were
54:08 - adding the slug before is because we we
54:10 - did want to manipulate the slug
54:14 - previously
54:16 - to try to make the urls match up between
54:18 - what we currently have and what we are
54:20 - going to have later in this case we
54:23 - didn't need to do that so
54:25 - i just didn't even think about it we had
54:27 - it had just been left in previously so
54:30 - that's a really good point though thanks
54:31 - for bringing that up
54:33 - i'll keep that in mind when we pull over
54:36 - more data
54:37 - that this is not necessary unless we we
54:40 - really need to change what the slug will
54:42 - be
54:43 - maybe we could avoid some errors you
54:45 - know potentially we have an error
54:47 - already in there
54:48 - um i won't once we get everything worked
54:51 - out i want to try to type in
54:55 - this in a url
54:56 - and see
54:58 - what data we can get
55:00 - i'm interested to see what what happens
55:02 - with that
55:06 - all right so let's go to our
55:11 - oh yeah server
55:13 - apollo
55:14 - is this it
55:17 - yeah this is it all right cool
55:22 - so we need to go to
55:26 - let's take this
55:28 - and
55:31 - oops
55:34 - can we just duplicate
55:37 - no
55:39 - all right let's grab this and make a new
55:42 - query
55:44 - new file we'll call it
55:48 - we're going to call this news
55:50 - dot js
55:52 - i'm going to paste in this
55:54 - we're going to change it
56:00 - to
56:00 - news news query
56:03 - we're going to change this to news
56:08 - all right so this should grab
56:11 - our id our title the slug
56:14 - the content
56:17 - and
56:18 - do we want
56:24 - let's grab the excerpt as well
56:26 - and the date
56:32 - all right yeah we're gonna we're gonna
56:34 - grab this we may not actually need the
56:37 - date uh it might already be with within
56:40 - the html
56:42 - but just to be safe we'll grab it
56:45 - it'll actually be good to have it
56:46 - because if we want to make a news page
56:48 - and order things chronologically
56:51 - then it would be we we definitely need a
56:53 - date
56:54 - uh to make that work
56:56 - and
56:58 - all right cool so we have this
57:02 - let's save it uh let's go into our
57:06 - pages
57:07 - and we're gonna take let's take our
57:10 - directory
57:12 - and just copy it and let's make
57:16 - another page
57:22 - another these are really react
57:23 - components but in terms of next js which
57:26 - we are also using
57:27 - uh
57:28 - the there there are pages
57:32 - in this case this acts more like a
57:33 - template for a page
57:36 - but you you'll see you'll see how it's
57:38 - how it's all gonna work and we'll also
57:40 - name this news.js
57:44 - here we are
57:45 - and let's change this
57:48 - change the word directory everywhere
57:53 - remember this one if you remember
57:54 - yesterday i forgot this part we had an
57:56 - error
57:58 - all right to news
58:04 - this is fine for now this will prove
58:06 - that we're actually getting the data
58:08 - and then we can see if we want to
58:10 - you know display anything else like the
58:12 - date or something like that
58:16 - all right let's save that now we need to
58:18 - go into our server as well
58:20 - let's go into server.js and let me
58:25 - let me give you the link
58:28 - to our ngrok server
58:31 - so you all can see it
58:33 - as we're working on it and and you can
58:36 - um
58:37 - see the data coming in as well
58:39 - so if you check that link sometimes
58:42 - there's weird problems with links so you
58:44 - might have to copy and paste the link to
58:45 - get it to work
58:47 - but hopefully you don't it looks like
58:49 - it's working
58:51 - so all right awesome sorry i didn't give
58:53 - you that link earlier we didn't really
58:55 - need it until now because we weren't
58:56 - doing anything directly with with the ui
58:59 - for the the react site but
59:02 - uh in any case now you'll have it
59:06 - uh we're gonna take this
59:09 - little block here
59:11 - and
59:12 - we're just gonna copy and paste that and
59:14 - instead of contact we're gonna say
59:16 - news
59:18 - and we're going to say news here
59:21 - let me explain what's going on here
59:24 - let's make this a bit bigger alright so
59:28 - here's what's happening
59:31 - we're saying that
59:33 - when
59:34 - a user
59:36 - types in url that has slash news slash
59:40 - whatever at the end so you know any
59:42 - value
59:43 - what we're going to do
59:45 - is we're going to pass that value at the
59:46 - end
59:48 - we're going to pass that into the
59:49 - component
59:52 - and
59:54 - the component that we're going to pass
59:55 - it to is going to be the news component
59:59 - right so that's what we want to do
60:01 - let's save that and then in our news
60:03 - component
60:05 - we're grabbing that so we get this query
60:07 - id we're grabbing that here in this get
60:10 - initial props function
60:12 - this is going to be able to run
60:14 - server side and client side this is a
60:17 - special function that next js has so
60:19 - that's why we're grabbing things here
60:21 - grabbing the proper data so we can get
60:23 - that nice server-side rendering
60:27 - we don't really need the console log
60:28 - here i just had that there for testing
60:30 - probably ought to take this out
60:35 - and
60:37 - let's see
60:41 - all right looks like oh okay so once we
60:43 - grab that id what we're trying to get
60:45 - from graphql
60:47 - is we're going to use that news query
60:49 - and we're going to pass it
60:51 - that id all right which is basically the
60:53 - slug from our our wordpress post
60:57 - then
60:58 - since we're calling on that news query
61:00 - let's go up here and check it out
61:03 - so the news query comes in
61:07 - and what are we passing in
61:09 - this name
61:11 - all right which is the id that's our
61:13 - slug so it's going to look for a news
61:15 - item where the name
61:18 - is equal to that slug
61:21 - so
61:22 - that's what it's going and it's going to
61:24 - return
61:25 - all of this data id title slug content
61:29 - excerpt and date it's going to return
61:31 - all of that
61:33 - um
61:36 - into
61:38 - um into this component right so it'll go
61:41 - back to the component of news.js
61:44 - and then it's going to put that data
61:47 - um in in here
61:49 - and rook
61:51 - you are on top of things because rook
61:53 - noticed that i forgot to change
61:55 - directories here
61:59 - thank you again
62:02 - so you see we're we're getting that
62:05 - object so we're there's now an object
62:07 - available to us
62:09 - we go data news edges
62:12 - where zero right so the edges is an
62:14 - array we want the first value
62:17 - node content
62:19 - and that matches up
62:22 - with our news here
62:24 - right
62:25 - edges
62:26 - node
62:28 - content
62:30 - right
62:33 - all right
62:35 - so now
62:36 - we have that here let me see
62:42 - i'm not sure if i need to restart the
62:43 - server or not
62:44 - let's do it just to be safe
62:47 - or actually no entry page news stop news
62:50 - whatever
62:51 - looks like uh some of you are trying to
62:53 - look up the news page right now
62:55 - um
63:04 - all right so that should restart and i
63:06 - need to find
63:08 - this a slug to try
63:11 - so
63:12 - let's try one that'll probably work
63:15 - because it's normal and then we'll try
63:17 - one that that first one that has some
63:19 - weird stuff going on
63:23 - all right so
63:25 - let's go back here and say
63:27 - news
63:28 - slash
63:33 - what the heck it just happened
63:38 - did that server come back up
63:46 - all right slash news
63:49 - slash
63:52 - all right
63:54 - passport server is not a valid graphql
63:56 - document node you may use graphql
63:58 - to learn another method
64:01 - into a document
64:02 - all right let's see what's happened
64:20 - all right let's go back to our code
64:24 - what did it say is pages all right
64:28 - um
64:32 - so unfortunately we don't have the
64:34 - correct line because it's using the
64:37 - um
64:38 - i guess a different version of this
64:41 - um
64:44 - let's see my timer just went off i kind
64:47 - of want to
64:48 - i wanted to see if this would work first
64:56 - all right
64:56 - let me go back and answer some questions
64:58 - and i will take five minutes and then
65:01 - um we'll go back to it and try to
65:03 - troubleshoot see what's going on
65:05 - probably it just messed something up
65:07 - when i was
65:08 - changing things over from news to
65:12 - um
65:13 - from directory to news
65:15 - but we'll see there might be something
65:17 - wrong with with our data
65:19 - we'll figure that out for now
65:22 - uh let me chat a bit with you all i'm
65:26 - gonna chat for five minutes with you
65:28 - then i'm gonna check and make sure
65:29 - nothing has come through on slack or my
65:32 - email that i need to handle for work if
65:34 - everything's good then we're gonna
65:36 - figure this out
65:48 - let's see
65:51 - all right so john hanson says with
65:53 - next.js is it then not necessary to
65:55 - install or use react router yeah you
65:58 - don't need to install or use react
66:00 - router with next so we're basically
66:02 - doing our own custom routing in
66:05 - here
66:08 - right so this is some some custom routes
66:11 - so we're just kind of doing our own
66:13 - thing
66:13 - i did see a tweet from
66:18 - can't remember his name guillermo i
66:20 - think his name is
66:21 - um
66:24 - uh anyway i tweet from he's like the the
66:27 - head of zeit which makes next
66:31 - i saw a tweet about the next version of
66:33 - next is going to actually incorporate
66:36 - react router into it
66:37 - so i'm not sure how that's going to work
66:39 - i didn't look into it but i figure at
66:42 - some point we'll probably be using the
66:44 - newer version so i have we'll have to
66:46 - learn it
66:47 - that would that would be kind of cool i
66:49 - think it would be nice to have the same
66:51 - type of routing across everything we're
66:53 - building since we're using react router
66:55 - for
66:56 - you know our
66:57 - our other stuff that we've made with
66:58 - create react app
67:02 - uh let's see uh
67:05 - dipak says hey jesse this is my first
67:07 - free code camp live stream what app are
67:09 - you using for your databases is it free
67:12 - you're doing great thanks for doing this
67:14 - most appreciated you're welcome i i
67:16 - appreciate the comment uh yeah let me
67:19 - show you
67:20 - what we're using for the database so
67:22 - this is
67:23 - um
67:24 - sql
67:26 - operations studio let's see if i can get
67:29 - yeah sql operation studio from microsoft
67:31 - it is entirely free it's free to
67:33 - download
67:35 - and it's it's an electron app it's built
67:38 - with javascript
67:40 - html so
67:44 - it's very similar
67:46 - in the way it's built and even in the ui
67:49 - to visual studio code you know you can
67:51 - see a lot of the you know kind of the
67:53 - similarities here same icon same layout
67:56 - things like that so
67:58 - that's what we're using
68:01 - i really like it i'm not a database
68:03 - person so i don't have much to compare
68:05 - it to other than like
68:07 - i don't like php
68:09 - admin or whatever it's called
68:11 - um
68:12 - or my php admin i don't remember what
68:14 - that is but i like it a lot better than
68:16 - that
68:23 - and also thanks for watching uh and
68:25 - welcome to the stream
68:29 - all right it says suraj says what do you
68:31 - do to select multiple words and update
68:34 - at once visual studio code oh cool the
68:36 - multiple cursor thing
68:38 - i love this it's so cool so let's just
68:40 - let's go to queer params here
68:43 - and
68:44 - i highlight what i want to select and if
68:46 - there's anything else below it
68:48 - that is the same
68:50 - i just hit command i'm on a mac so i hit
68:52 - command d i assume it would be control d
68:55 - on windows but i'm not sure
68:57 - and then i just
68:58 - every time i hit d it selects something
69:00 - new and then i can go in here and i can
69:02 - add whatever i want
69:04 - backspace
69:07 - and i can even move the cursor around
69:10 - with the left and right arrow keys even
69:12 - i can go down with the down arrow key or
69:15 - up
69:17 - so really cool and useful
69:19 - when you don't need the power of a find
69:22 - and replace and there's just a few
69:24 - things that you need to change it's
69:26 - faster than find and replace at least it
69:28 - is for me
69:29 - so i really like it i will say though
69:32 - that i'm using the key bindings for the
69:34 - atom editor because i switched from atom
69:36 - to here so i don't know what the default
69:38 - is for visual studio code it might be
69:40 - different so
69:42 - i would check check that out
69:44 - you know just check the documentation it
69:46 - might might be different
70:00 - coding and caffeine says hello it's me i
70:03 - was wondering if some of you wanted a
70:04 - cup of coffee i actually do want a cup
70:07 - of coffee
70:08 - um so i have i've had a lot of caffeine
70:10 - already today i guess i had a double
70:12 - espresso this morning i had some g fuel
70:15 - um
70:17 - and remember g-fuel you can sponsor me
70:20 - but
70:21 - had some g-fuel before the stream to
70:24 - help me get kind of pumped up otherwise
70:28 - i seem depressed on the stream
70:31 - so
70:33 - but i'd still like more coffee
70:38 - i'm pretty much always going to say yes
70:40 - to coffee if somebody
70:42 - offers let's see i'm just the my timer
70:46 - went up i'm just checking because i'm
70:47 - almost at the end of the live chat
70:55 - uh john said can the slug be generated
70:58 - from another better source
71:00 - uh like append a number
71:02 - um
71:03 - i don't
71:04 - i don't know i i tried to look for
71:06 - something better but i think the title
71:08 - was
71:11 - uh the title makes sense to use
71:15 - i'm just i'm gonna go with that
71:19 - um
71:20 - michael asks what is the visual studio
71:22 - code plugin that adds the file size on
71:24 - the import statements let me share a
71:28 - link with you all
71:29 - so
71:30 - hopefully this works you may have to
71:32 - copy and paste it because links are
71:34 - weird sometimes in the youtube live chat
71:37 - but
71:38 - there's a plug-in called the react food
71:41 - truck
71:42 - and it actually just pulls in a lot of
71:44 - other plug-ins that have to do with
71:45 - react so that's how i got it initially
71:47 - if you just want the one plug-in
71:50 - um let me look up the name for you
71:53 - it is
71:54 - import cost so the plugin is called
71:56 - import cost
72:00 - and i can send i can give you the direct
72:02 - link to that as well
72:04 - so here's the link to that plugin
72:09 - but uh really cool though isn't it uh so
72:12 - you automatically know
72:14 - you know what
72:15 - with the plug-in and even is different
72:17 - like
72:18 - um
72:18 - this is 1.1 megabytes and it's in red so
72:22 - i assume the red means hey this is a big
72:26 - this is a big plugin this is a big
72:28 - package that you're bringing in
72:32 - so it's kind of cool i haven't really
72:33 - acted on any of that yet but i imagine
72:35 - if i was really trying to improve things
72:37 - and go in
72:38 - that would be so helpful to just be able
72:40 - to see right away like oh maybe i don't
72:43 - need to import all of this
72:48 - all right let me
72:59 - let me know if the stream status is okay
73:01 - i'm
73:02 - it's telling me that it's bad right now
73:06 - i'm not sure why but if the stream
73:09 - starts getting weird just just let me
73:11 - know
73:13 - i don't really know if i can do anything
73:14 - about it
73:16 - but i still like to know
73:22 - let's see
73:24 - uh osuna asked did you make this website
73:26 - mobile responsive um it's kind of
73:28 - responsive right now i haven't really
73:30 - checked everything out but it should be
73:31 - because we're using material ui
73:34 - uh to handle like our layout and
73:35 - everything so that's like by default
73:38 - responsive
73:40 - but like i said i haven't actually
73:42 - checked it on a phone yet so i don't
73:44 - know for sure but we'll do all that as
73:46 - as it gets
73:48 - you know we get more things built out
73:56 - all right
73:58 - let's
74:01 - let's figure out what the problem is
74:02 - here so
74:04 - all right let's first let's look at
74:06 - server let's make sure news id
74:09 - we're sending it to news
74:11 - all right that looks that's good that's
74:13 - as it should be
74:14 - let's just start at the top and make
74:16 - sure oops there we are
74:19 - there's the problem
74:20 - um
74:22 - we want to take it from the news
74:23 - directory
74:25 - i can't believe i remembered this part
74:27 - and forget this part again
74:29 - did the same thing yesterday all right
74:31 - let's save that now and try again
74:35 - let's refresh a there we go
74:38 - oh let's see
74:41 - this is a bit of a mess
74:44 - wow
74:48 - wow
74:49 - wow
74:55 - wow
75:04 - that looks pretty bad
75:11 - um don xavier says the links aren't
75:14 - working that i posted you may have to
75:15 - just copy and paste the links
75:18 - uh because when when you
75:20 - when you put a link in the youtube live
75:22 - chat youtube actually is like redirects
75:25 - you to it and so it doesn't always work
75:28 - so i would
75:31 - um try
75:33 - try that try to copy and paste or
75:35 - something it
75:37 - the links work i just went to them
75:40 - but just not if you click it inside the
75:42 - live chat
75:46 - all right
75:48 - all right let me ask you all uh do you
75:51 - want me to start styling this right now
75:54 - or do you think we've had a long enough
75:56 - stream we should save it till tomorrow
75:58 - or some other time
75:59 - i'll give everybody just
76:02 - i'll give everybody a minute to
76:04 - respond while i check my work slack and
76:07 - email
76:08 - since i forgot to do that
76:34 - all right nothing on slack that i need
76:36 - to worry about
76:37 - let's
76:46 - see nothing in my email
76:54 - all right
76:56 - looks good looks like we're good to go
76:58 - so if you all want me to keep going i i
77:01 - can
77:02 - i might keep going regardless because
77:04 - i'm still at work and have to work on it
77:06 - it's just a matter of um
77:10 - uh
77:11 - whether or not i stream what the work
77:13 - that i'm about to do
77:27 - see
77:38 - all right so
77:40 - i haven't gotten a response at all one
77:42 - way or another about whether i should
77:44 - stream the rest of this
77:49 - let's see
77:51 - we still have
77:53 - over 30 viewers so
77:56 - looks like there's still some interest
78:00 - all right i'm just gonna keep going and
78:02 - do some basic styling then
78:10 - all right
78:14 - i had to change my song really quick and
78:17 - i didn't like the song that was on
78:20 - can't possibly do
78:22 - do coding without the right music right
78:25 - all right so
78:26 - let's inspect what we have
78:29 - see what we can do about it
78:34 - all right so it looks like
78:37 - we have some
78:38 - images
78:52 - oh you know what i did want to test out
78:54 - that other one first let me do it before
78:55 - i forget
78:56 - so
79:00 - we had that weird slug with
79:04 - which one this one
79:10 - let's test it out
79:12 - um
79:14 - that's not it
79:15 - there's some news
79:28 - wait a second
79:31 - that was the slug that had the problem
79:33 - right
79:40 - maybe it's a different one
79:49 - no that was it that was one of the
79:51 - problem
79:53 - maybe this one
79:58 - no all right i don't know what happened
80:00 - but the problem's not there anymore so
80:03 - that's good news i'm gonna leave it
80:04 - alone
80:08 - all right so
80:12 - let's check out
80:16 - this image
80:18 - [Music]
80:37 - let's try
80:38 - https
80:42 - slash
80:57 - that should work
81:12 - i'm going to put this in
81:14 - a browser on my other screen
81:17 - see if anything comes up
81:27 - uh it's not there anymore
81:39 - all right
81:45 - oh well so i'm not sure if we'll be able
81:47 - to get the um
81:49 - the images
81:51 - so
81:52 - for now
81:57 - i need to hide the image
82:00 - i'll i'm not going to worry about the
82:01 - images now
82:05 - i'll need to find these at some point
82:07 - and and figure out what to do with him
82:11 - but let's see
82:19 - we should add the title in here
82:23 - we already have the date
82:34 - what is all this stuff why do we have
82:36 - the same thing repeated
82:52 - news summary and related news summary
82:57 - all right
82:58 - we need to get rid of these
83:07 - all right so let's do some work
83:10 - on getting rid of let's get rid of
83:12 - everything we don't want first before we
83:13 - try to style or add anything
83:15 - uh it'll probably look
83:18 - a little easier if we
83:21 - uh
83:22 - bring it bring the content down first
83:23 - the amount of content
83:25 - so
83:28 - let's check this out let me look back as
83:30 - well at what we did with
83:33 - this faculty because we did do a lot of
83:35 - this type of work with the faculty
83:38 - we did some
83:40 - manipulation here of
83:45 - of the markup
83:47 - which we may want to do that as well
83:50 - let's see
83:57 - hmm
84:00 - i mean the easiest thing would be
84:05 - probably just to do some css and hide it
84:08 - with css right now
84:11 - um so let's grab
84:14 - let's actually get this css page and i
84:17 - i'm
84:18 - probably will come up with a better way
84:20 - to do css but
84:22 - at this point you know this is how i'm
84:24 - going to do it
84:27 - styles where am i putting my styles
84:49 - oh okay i'm bringing it in with this
84:53 - static styles factory all right
85:06 - all right
85:07 - oops and i forgot to set my timer again
85:12 - let me do that
85:15 - all right so
85:17 - i'm going to copy what i have here
85:20 - and paste it as a start i realize that
85:23 - this is not the way we want to do it um
85:26 - completely so
85:27 - maybe i'll make an issue about figuring
85:29 - out what we're going to do with css and
85:31 - then
85:32 - stick with it
85:34 - i didn't really want to decide until we
85:36 - started importing more things and seeing
85:38 - like what we were working with how much
85:40 - css would we want to reuse how much
85:42 - would be unique
85:44 - so we'll get a better idea now that we
85:46 - have you know several different
85:48 - content types
85:50 - imported now
85:52 - all right so i'm going to copy that
85:54 - and i'm going to make another css file
85:58 - and
85:59 - a new file we're going to call it news
86:02 - dot css
86:05 - and then obviously too i'd much rather
86:07 - be doing sas than css
86:10 - this we have for now and then
86:12 - let's go back to that faculty page
86:18 - and let's copy
86:22 - this portion here
86:24 - and use it
86:27 - in our news page
86:33 - do we have it in layout
86:35 - let's see
86:42 - we did and we also need to bring this in
86:53 - and we had brought in grid as well i'm
86:56 - not going to bring that in yet though
86:57 - because i'm not even sure if that
87:00 - worked for us before
87:05 - and where are we at so much stuff going
87:07 - on let's get rid of some of this
87:10 - oh
87:11 - don't want to save
87:13 - let's all right let's wait let's hold
87:15 - off on that
87:19 - solutions queries
87:22 - directories
87:24 - post
87:25 - tests
87:29 - there we are news we don't need that or
87:32 - that
87:34 - that
87:35 - or that
87:37 - or that all right that's a lot more
87:40 - simple
87:44 - there we are and we want to change this
87:47 - to be news
87:52 - all right great
87:54 - so
87:55 - let's let's see what we have now
87:57 - just by bringing that css in
88:01 - i imagine we'll have
88:03 - you know some
88:04 - some impact on how this looks all right
88:07 - it's not bad
88:09 - already it's better
88:11 - not
88:12 - 100 percent uh but better for sure
88:18 - nice
88:19 - nice i i like that
88:26 - sweet
88:32 - hey wait a second
88:33 - hey this actually this article links to
88:36 - the website that we built together the
88:38 - catechetics.com site so
88:40 - uh that's pretty fun
88:44 - all right
88:48 - uh let's add some things in here to get
88:51 - rid of a lot of this stuff at the top
88:53 - that we don't really need
88:54 - and
88:56 - then we'll probably add in a title after
88:59 - that
89:00 - oops moved it over here
89:03 - all right so let's check our css page
89:06 - and we need to check the names again
89:12 - let's check the names
89:18 - news summary
89:22 - i wonder if we can just get rid of this
89:24 - whole thing
89:27 - this whole first part
89:32 - why is the title
89:34 - not showing up at all
89:39 - that's weird
89:41 - but it's okay
89:46 - roots
89:47 - yeah let's just get rid of root
89:50 - that'll solve all our problems awesome
89:55 - we'll get rid of root uh at some point
89:57 - we'll have to figure out what to do
89:58 - about the image
90:02 - uh yeah i'm not sure
90:04 - but for now we'll get rid of root
90:06 - that'll save us
90:09 - a lot of time of trying to pick through
90:11 - what we want and don't want
90:13 - and then we'll add in a title on our own
90:15 - instead of getting that title to show up
90:17 - that that we saw in the markup
90:21 - so let's go
90:23 - computer
90:26 - content
90:29 - there we are
90:31 - let's go roots
90:36 - we're going to do a display none
90:41 - on that that component that was called
90:43 - root we're also going to get rid of some
90:45 - of these that i know we don't need so we
90:48 - don't need a name or phone
90:51 - uh columns that's fine i don't know if
90:55 - we have a right column
90:57 - or center column we'll have to double
90:59 - check that
91:01 - heading
91:02 - h6
91:04 - let's use your detail side
91:12 - um most of these we probably don't have
91:16 - i wonder though if any of these would
91:18 - end up having a video embed so i'm going
91:19 - to leave that in for now
91:24 - all right so most of it we're going to
91:25 - keep
91:27 - and
91:28 - all right so let's let's see make verify
91:31 - that this actually is going to remove
91:32 - what we want great it removed it now
91:35 - let's add in a title
91:39 - so
91:40 - we're going to go with
91:45 - and
91:45 - [Music]
91:47 - let's see
91:50 - typography
91:59 - and then
92:02 - are we bringing typography in
92:04 - no we're not we need to bring in
92:06 - typography
92:11 - what are we bringing in we're not
92:12 - bringing in anything from material ui
92:14 - wow
92:18 - did we bring it in here
92:21 - no
92:22 - wow
92:26 - uh we definitely brought it in for our
92:28 - index
92:30 - so let's check that
92:36 - typography
92:38 - so
92:39 - always better to try to copy and paste
92:40 - from somewhere that we know it works
92:43 - right
92:44 - and so we're bringing that in
92:48 - and i also want to check
92:51 - what the name of
92:54 - all right display 2 subheading
93:00 - display 2
93:02 - what did we use
93:06 - headline component h2
93:14 - so we used did that work
93:18 - yeah let's try it out
93:21 - typography type headline component h2
93:24 - we'll try it
93:40 - we have an h2 really it probably should
93:43 - be in h3
93:46 - um but we'll we'll see
93:50 - um actually let's let's do it like this
93:58 - let's go
94:06 - dangerously said enter html
94:11 - html i'll explain in a second why i want
94:13 - to do it this way
94:19 - edges
94:22 - zero
94:29 - node
94:30 - title
94:35 - is it title or is it name
94:40 - let's check
94:50 - this title
95:04 - and why we have a problem here
95:42 - all right what am i missing
96:00 - so
96:10 - hmm
96:13 - oh something i guess there's something
96:15 - wrong with the video
96:18 - let's see what's going on
96:22 - all right this is weird so
96:27 - obs says that everything's fine but
96:30 - youtube's admin panel says the stream
96:33 - status is bad for resolution
96:40 - all right i'm not sure what's happening
96:41 - um
96:42 - everybody let me know everybody who can
96:44 - in live chat let me know if the stream
96:46 - is okay or if it's bad
96:49 - if the quality is going bad i might just
96:52 - end the stream because
96:54 - i don't want there to be a bunch of
96:56 - you know bad quality at the end of the
96:58 - video
97:10 - all right so
97:11 - that's that's really weird
97:14 - so this shows up
97:15 - it's fine
97:17 - but
97:18 - i'm getting a weird error
97:21 - here
97:31 - uh
97:32 - that's that's pretty weird
97:42 - all right
97:43 - let's copy and paste this
97:56 - i'm still getting something
98:09 - so
98:27 - that's weird
98:31 - all right
98:32 - well it looks like the video then is is
98:35 - no good
98:36 - so
98:40 - actually i think i'm gonna stop here i
98:41 - mean if you look at it
98:43 - this doesn't look bad right
98:45 - the only so you all can't see but
98:47 - basically if you can't see what's going
98:49 - on let me explain
98:51 - everything looks fine we've removed a
98:53 - lot of what we wanted to remove we now
98:55 - have a proper title
98:56 - it needs aligned better with the rest of
98:59 - the content the only thing that i would
99:00 - add at this point is a date
99:04 - so i would add the date somewhere
99:06 - in here
99:08 - probably at the top
99:10 - and that's really about it uh maybe i
99:14 - would change the link color
99:16 - possibly make the uh font size a bit
99:19 - bigger
99:20 - but that's it so
99:25 - all right so let me
99:29 - uh let me wrap things up then
99:31 - uh i'm gonna check the live chat quickly
99:33 - to see if there are any comments that i
99:35 - should respond to
99:37 - since it doesn't really matter for if i
99:39 - have video for that
99:42 - let's see
99:54 - all right
99:59 - let's see uh john hanson says my son
100:01 - challenged me to build a react component
100:04 - uh ever play with a toy called light
100:07 - bright it uses touch and mouse events
100:09 - give it a try
100:11 - ah no way
100:13 - john did you build light bright
100:15 - in react
100:18 - i've gotta check this out
100:22 - i wish my video wasn't first and i would
100:24 - show everybody
100:26 - uh what you made
100:29 - well i'll try to show everybody anyway
100:32 - if the video comes back in i guess they
100:34 - can see it
100:39 - hopefully this url works
100:41 - you know how it is sometimes with the
100:43 - the youtube stuff
100:44 - even if you put it in like this
100:46 - sometimes it still doesn't work
100:48 - yes
100:58 - oh
100:58 - wow
101:00 - john
101:01 - this is
101:02 - amazing
101:04 - all right you all probably can't see
101:06 - this light right thing but you you have
101:08 - to check it out
101:10 - uh i'm gonna paste the
101:12 - the url in the chat as well
101:16 - wow
101:20 - wow this is so cool
101:22 - i'm showing my kids when i get home
101:30 - uh i want to bring this up on my uh my
101:32 - chromebook is touchscreen
101:35 - this would be so cool with just to be
101:37 - able to touch it wow
101:39 - john
101:40 - amazing amazing work that's the that's
101:43 - the coolest thing i've seen in a while
101:47 - wow that's awesome i love it when stuff
101:49 - like this happens on the stream you are
101:51 - like so creative and
101:54 - i love it when you share stuff like that
102:04 - uh rick adams has just read a uh
102:06 - linkedin
102:09 - pm for a front-end function for
102:13 - monday given my focus is more on back
102:16 - end which qualitative
102:18 - suggests and front-end design video
102:20 - tours are recommended
102:23 - um
102:33 - for front-end stuff
102:37 - i mean you could check out
102:39 - check check out some of the videos here
102:41 - on the free code cam channel
102:43 - uh it's on a lot of different topics so
102:46 - um just kind of sift through some of
102:48 - them
102:51 - there's a youtube channel called dev
102:53 - tips
102:54 - d-e-v-t-i-p
102:56 - and um the videos are kind of older
103:00 - but
103:01 - a lot of really good stuff about
103:03 - you know front-end work
103:05 - uh so check that out
103:07 - trying to think what else i would go
103:09 - with
103:11 - uh udacity has some front-end courses
103:14 - that are free
103:15 - and there's a lot of video content in
103:17 - those courses
103:18 - so you can check that out as well
103:35 - let's see
103:45 - all right world says does graphql let
103:48 - you query any random website
103:51 - or does that website need that graphql
103:53 - already configured uh that website needs
103:55 - to have graphql already configured think
103:58 - of it like a rest api right you you'd
104:00 - have to someone would have to build the
104:02 - rest api for you to be able to use it
104:04 - it's the same thing with graphql they
104:07 - would have to build
104:08 - the graphql api is that safe to call a
104:11 - graphql api
104:13 - it functions like that right
104:16 - um
104:17 - i mean i know it's it's graph query
104:19 - language um
104:22 - anyway
104:24 - uh
104:25 - someone would have to build that out
104:26 - just like they would a rest api
104:29 - that's a good question though
104:32 - the video came back
104:39 - oh
104:40 - cool
104:41 - john said to drag my mouse on the board
104:46 - that's so cool
104:51 - oh man
104:55 - john is it cool if i share this with a
104:57 - bunch of people
104:58 - because this is really i mean i would
105:00 - definitely give you all the credit but
105:04 - this is awesome
105:10 - i used to love lightbrite when i was a
105:12 - kid this is really cool
105:27 - all right mandela um says you need to
105:30 - restart the stream if it happens next
105:32 - time youtube can give me a thousand for
105:34 - console fee
105:37 - yeah i'll um maybe i should have just
105:39 - restarted
105:40 - um right
105:42 - away i will remember that for next time
105:53 - all right
105:55 - um let me now that the video is back let
105:57 - me switch back quickly
106:00 - to here this is what i was talking about
106:03 - right we have
106:04 - all our paragraphs here uh it's the
106:06 - right font i think it needs to be a bit
106:08 - bigger like font size um but same way
106:12 - with the title title needs to be a bit
106:14 - bigger and it needs to be aligned
106:15 - properly but like i said it's not bad
106:18 - uh looks good just needs
106:21 - the only thing i would add would be the
106:23 - date
106:25 - um but not bad at all
106:28 - at some point it might be cool to
106:30 - include categories and people could
106:32 - click and sort by categories but i'm not
106:34 - worried about that right now that would
106:35 - be additional functionality that we
106:37 - could add in once
106:39 - that data did get entered
106:44 - all right
106:46 - cool
106:48 - this will be fun i think i might share
106:50 - this
106:51 - my boss has been really busy with some
106:53 - other stuff so he still hasn't had a
106:54 - chance to review any of the work we've
106:56 - done so far
106:58 - um so i'm gonna let him handle his stuff
107:00 - and whenever things calm down a bit then
107:02 - maybe i'll i'll show this to him but
107:05 - maybe i'll share it with some other
107:06 - co-workers so i can get some early
107:08 - feedback
107:09 - um
107:10 - and you know see if everyone thinks
107:12 - we're going in the right direction
107:15 - all right
107:16 - awesome so i'm gonna wrap things up now
107:19 - it's been a longer than normal stream
107:20 - but really fun we've gotten a lot done
107:23 - we didn't mess things up
107:25 - i messed them up a little bit but they
107:27 - were really easy errors to um
107:30 - to overcome
107:32 - and we got a ton of data imported into
107:35 - wordpress like
107:37 - over 500
107:39 - uh what do you call them records right
107:42 - so we have over 500 posts under the news
107:44 - post type and when we started that post
107:46 - type didn't even exist in our wordpress
107:49 - install so
107:51 - not only did we get a new post type and
107:53 - all the data in but now we're actually
107:54 - displaying it properly with the proper
107:56 - parameterized routing
107:58 - but all the infos there needs a bit of
108:00 - work work on the styling but
108:02 - overall i'm really happy with today's
108:05 - stream
