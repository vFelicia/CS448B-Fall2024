00:00 - in my previous video on subsets and
00:01 - supersets i stated that to show equality
00:04 - you have to prove that each side of an
00:06 - equation
00:07 - are are subsets of each other
00:10 - so to prove the distributive law we're
00:12 - going to have this video we're going to
00:13 - have the next video in this video i'm
00:14 - going to be showing that a is a
00:17 - a intersection b union c is a subset of
00:21 - a intersection b union a intersection c
00:24 - so let's start the proof
00:27 - suppose that x is an element of a
00:30 - intersection b union c
00:32 - then x is an element of a and x is an
00:35 - element of b union c by definition of d
00:39 - intersection
00:41 - so we still know that x is an element of
00:43 - a
00:44 - and by definition we know that x is an
00:46 - element of b or x is an element of c
00:49 - from this we can deduce that x is x is
00:51 - an element of a and x is an element of b
00:54 - or
00:55 - x is an element of a and x is an element
00:58 - of c
00:59 - now by definition we can
01:01 - put this or rewrite this as x as an
01:04 - element of a intersection b
01:06 - or x is an element of a intersection c
01:10 - and finally we can deduce that x is an
01:13 - element of a intersection b
01:15 - union a intersection c so there you have
01:18 - it we've shown that
01:20 - since x is an element of a intersection
01:22 - b union c
01:24 - and x is an element of a intersection b
01:26 - union a intersection c uh x is in
01:30 - both of these and therefore a
01:33 - intersection b union c is in fact a
01:35 - subset of a intersection b
01:38 - union a intersection c
