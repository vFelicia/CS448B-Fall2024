00:05 - hey everybody its Jessie and today we're
00:11 - going to finish our our load balancer
00:14 - that we started yesterday and we got
00:16 - everything working out but we just
00:18 - needed to get it working with our SSL so
00:23 - we're going to do that today and we're
00:25 - going to use there's two different ways
00:26 - to do that in digitalocean
00:28 - and we're going to use the pass-through
00:31 - technique so the traffic is going to be
00:34 - encrypted even once it gets past the
00:37 - load balancer since we already had SSL
00:40 - setup that seems like it's going to be
00:43 - the easiest way to do things you can
00:46 - also do it a different way where your
00:50 - SSL is set up at the level of the load
00:53 - balancer and then that's where it gets
00:57 - unencrypted and then it goes to your
01:02 - servers that are behind the load
01:03 - balancer so but we're going to do it the
01:05 - first way I I'm getting I'm getting the
01:13 - message here on the stream that the
01:15 - streams not not great so let me know I
01:21 - know there'll be a delay so I'm probably
01:22 - back for about a minute but let me know
01:25 - how this is coming through on your end
01:27 - I am streaming from home again so if
01:31 - you're with me yesterday you know my
01:32 - network is not great I did lower the
01:36 - settings so yesterday yesterday I had
01:44 - kind of too ambitious settings hey
01:49 - Sebastian so somebody is in the live
01:51 - chat sebastian's and then he said hey so
01:52 - I'm assuming that means he can hear me
01:56 - sooner yesterday the settings were too
01:59 - ambitious so I lowered them now so I'm
02:03 - trying to get 720p normally I stream in
02:06 - 1080p but that's from work and the work
02:12 - network is good
02:12 - enough that I could probably do 2k and
02:14 - it would be fine my home network I'm not
02:17 - even sure I can get 720p yesterday the
02:21 - recording I just checked the recording
02:23 - earlier today and the highest that you
02:25 - can even play it back is it 480 which is
02:29 - not great so hopefully it's good enough
02:31 - that you can see what I was doing but
02:35 - not really great so hopefully next week
02:39 - I'll be back in in the office and can
02:44 - stream at my normal quality and
02:46 - hopefully one day I can actually get
02:49 - better internet at my house so I don't
02:53 - know when that will happen but that'll
02:54 - be awesome if it does so before we get
02:57 - started I have a few questions for for
03:01 - you all that are watching now live and
03:04 - that will give everybody a chance to to
03:07 - get in here if they're going to be a few
03:09 - minutes late getting in before we get
03:10 - started so yeah we only have about 22
03:14 - viewers right now we usually have more
03:16 - than that so okay Sebastian says that
03:19 - the video does keep stopping sometimes
03:22 - so that's the thing okay I've had a good
03:25 - stream status for maybe like a minute
03:28 - now so hopefully it'll it'll stay good
03:31 - yet normally I am I do work from the
03:35 - office I rarely work from home but okay
03:41 - so it is it is lagging Mira says it's
03:44 - lagging as well okay so I'm sorry about
03:47 - that we'll try try to keep going if it
03:49 - gets so bad that it's not you can't even
03:53 - watch it at all just let me know maybe I
03:59 - can try to and yeah I don't know what I
04:04 - can do as far as the settings go you
04:07 - know because I actually did lower them
04:08 - from yesterday so it should be I mean it
04:12 - should be a little better than it was
04:15 - yesterday but if it's just terrible and
04:20 - totally unwatchable I guess you know let
04:22 - me know in the live chat and then maybe
04:26 - I don't know maybe I can mess with the
04:31 - settings a little bit and if worse comes
04:33 - to worse I can just either postpone this
04:36 - till next week or record it and then
04:40 - upload it and then at least at least you
04:46 - can all watch it at some point today but
04:48 - it would just be recording I'd rather
04:50 - not have to do that because I do like
04:51 - being able to do the live chat so all
04:57 - I'll give it a few more minutes just to
05:01 - just to try to test it out here before
05:04 - we try to change anything you just same
05:07 - setting as yesterday keeps buffering hmm
05:12 - alright let me go in let me check my
05:15 - settings here hmm the only thing
05:35 - all right let me I'm looking at my
05:39 - settings right now Patrick says pause my
05:44 - Torrance I don't don't have anything
05:47 - going on in the background I'm gonna do
05:57 - I'm going to do a speed test really
05:59 - quick to see maybe maybe my Internet's
06:02 - just slower than normal I mean it's the
06:06 - same time of day as yesterday it ought
06:07 - to be I mean also be comparable so this
06:16 - once I get my my upload speed that
06:19 - should maybe tell me what I should set
06:23 - my my bitrate at it's not looking great
06:30 - 1.5 upload yeah I was getting twice as
06:34 - much as that yesterday for upload but
06:38 - still right now I only have my bitrate
06:40 - set at 1500 so that should I guess it
06:44 - should work
06:53 - let's uh
07:01 - I guess I can mess with my bitrate I'm
07:03 - not I'm not super knowledgeable about
07:06 - OBS I'm gonna bring this over actually
07:09 - so you can you can see what I'm saying
07:11 - hopefully assuming the video quality is
07:14 - good enough for you to even see this so
07:17 - these are my settings normally the
07:20 - settings you know that I have this set a
07:23 - lot higher but it should even with the
07:30 - upload speed that I have from the test
07:32 - that I just did the 1500 bit rate should
07:36 - be okay and that's the minimum that you
07:38 - need to stream 720p I can't change so as
07:43 - far as the YouTube settings go I
07:47 - actually can't go back and change the
07:50 - the ingestion settings as far as the
07:55 - like what I set the the bitrate at so
07:58 - like I said it for 720p minimum 1500
08:03 - kilobits per second so I can't change
08:08 - that
08:12 - hmm that said I'd have to actually end
08:16 - this stream and start another one I'm
08:18 - going to start another event so
08:25 - yeah and I'm looking here at my my
08:28 - stream status I'm not I'm not actually
08:30 - hitting that 1,500 I'm coming close but
08:34 - I'm not hitting that I'm definitely
08:35 - under it okay I just I just popped up
08:39 - over while now I hit 2,000 it's just
08:42 - really it's lagging on 360 okay so in
08:47 - the live chat I'm saying it's lagging on
08:50 - 360p yeah it's it's actually it's all
08:53 - over the place I'm watching the stream
08:55 - the status here you know on my machine
08:59 - and I'm getting anywhere from 2,000
09:03 - kilobits per second all the way down to
09:06 - like 700 and I was 600 it's just
09:10 - bouncing around like crazy
09:17 - alright well at least before before I
09:20 - change this or do something else let me
09:22 - at least ask a few things that I did
09:24 - want to ask you at the beginning here
09:27 - and one is I got a new microphone and I
09:34 - just set it up so I'd like to know if
09:36 - this sounds better or worse than what I
09:38 - had yesterday and what I normally have
09:40 - so normally I just used the built-in mic
09:42 - that's built into either the the iMac or
09:46 - MacBook Pro but I did buy another mic it
09:49 - just came in yesterday I set it up so it
09:52 - was on sale it was pretty cheap so I
09:54 - thought why not it had good reviews on
09:56 - Amazon I thought you know it at the very
10:00 - least it might be a little bit better
10:01 - than what the built-in mic does so just
10:05 - let me know it might be hard to tell
10:06 - since the video quality is so the string
10:09 - quality is so bad right now also I had I
10:15 - had someone comment on the colors that I
10:19 - was using saying is really hard on their
10:22 - eyes so I at first I thought they were
10:27 - talking about my my code editor but then
10:35 - I realized after they posted an example
10:37 - of something
10:39 - that would be easier on the eyes that
10:40 - the background color looked pretty much
10:42 - exactly the same so I think maybe they
10:44 - were talking about my terminal so I
10:47 - switched it up so this is what I
10:49 - normally have is black just completely
10:52 - black background and I think that was
10:55 - just the default dark theme that came
10:56 - with item 2 so I changed it a little bit
11:00 - and made the background more grey I
11:03 - don't know if if anyone else has been
11:06 - having that issue where that's been hard
11:07 - on them hard on their eyes to see let me
11:09 - know I don't have a problem keeping it
11:11 - with this gray this actually matches a
11:13 - little bit better with my code editor
11:16 - anyway so I may just keep it like that
11:18 - but I just wanted to know your thoughts
11:21 - on that should I change it to something
11:23 - totally different
11:25 - is anybody else having issues with
11:26 - seeing things the only other things I
11:34 - wanted to do I had Oliver on Mensa on
11:38 - Twitter requested that I just go over
11:41 - the WordPress API just a little bit
11:43 - about how I'm getting data from there so
11:45 - I thought I might take a minute to do
11:47 - that so we'll see but assuming this
11:51 - stream is watchable I will do that
11:53 - otherwise
11:54 - maybe I'll just make a video and I also
11:57 - had a comment this is last last question
11:59 - I also had a comment yesterday saying
12:01 - that I sounded a depressed so I wasn't
12:05 - depressed but it may it got me thinking
12:08 - maybe I sound depressed all the time
12:10 - when I do videos and I don't want to
12:12 - because I'd rather sound happy or at the
12:16 - very least like neutral and not
12:18 - depressed because I don't think it would
12:20 - be enjoyable to listen to somebody who
12:23 - sounded depressed the whole time so let
12:25 - me know if it does seem like I sound
12:28 - depressed alright so I'm getting some
12:32 - feedback so it looks like Patrick and
12:35 - Sebastian say the the mic sounds good so
12:38 - awesome I mean I'm not I'm just talking
12:41 - so I'm I'm not really expecting like you
12:45 - know I need excellent quality sound I
12:47 - mean maybe if I if I keep streaming and
12:50 - I get you know
12:51 - people watching at some point maybe I'll
12:53 - get like an actual like a really good
12:55 - mic but for now I think this is this is
12:58 - fine I've really haven't had complaints
13:00 - about the the audio quality and Patrick
13:05 - also says plus 1 4 WP API so I think
13:09 - I'll I will go over that then let's see
13:19 - I'm gonna check out the stream stats
13:22 - just to see what ok Sebastian says it is
13:28 - cutting the sound occasionally but
13:30 - that's probably a video problem also a
13:35 - Sebastian also wants to know about the
13:37 - WP API ok cool I didn't realize so many
13:40 - people were interested in that I would
13:41 - have would have done more with it so it
13:44 - looks like most there are some people
13:48 - that are getting a 720p stream it
13:52 - doesn't it doesn't say how good that
13:54 - stream is how much buffering but at
13:55 - least the majority of people are
13:58 - actually getting a 720p stream right now
14:02 - some are actually getting like really
14:04 - low like 240 I'm going to here's what
14:10 - I'm going to do I'm going to attempt at
14:12 - least to go over some WP API stuff and
14:14 - I'm going to blow up the the text I'm
14:16 - going to increase the font size as big
14:18 - as I can ok Sebastian says the delay
14:23 - delay for him is only about 5 to 10
14:26 - seconds I can there was a setting I
14:31 - wonder if I can get to it
14:34 - there was a setting about whether I
14:38 - would go for low latency or less
14:40 - buffering and I almost I always pick low
14:42 - latency so that there's less lag time
14:45 - between what I am saying annoying and
14:48 - and when you see it but maybe I should
14:51 - if I can still do that I'm going to try
14:53 - to switch that back to less buffering I
15:00 - don't know if some of the settings are
15:02 - locked in and you can't change the
15:05 - after you've made the made the video
15:08 - actually I can't change this so I'm
15:11 - going to switch it up for less buffering
15:12 - hopefully that makes a difference so
15:15 - I've saved that I assumed that'll
15:18 - that'll go a take effect immediately so
15:24 - there may be more of a delay than normal
15:26 - between what I say and do and and when
15:29 - you see and hear that but hopefully that
15:32 - will there'll be a little less buffering
15:40 - okay
15:42 - DAW says it's good for 720p Patrick went
15:50 - down to 480p and it's buffering less
15:53 - okay
15:54 - so oh I'm sorry about that like I said
15:58 - normally if you're just watching and you
15:59 - haven't watched my earlier streams this
16:01 - is an anomaly here I don't normally
16:04 - stream from this location usually
16:06 - there's no problem with the stream you
16:08 - can stream @ 1080p and as long as your
16:11 - connection is okay
16:12 - it'll be fine today I'm just on a bad
16:15 - connection so next week it'll be back to
16:17 - normal
16:18 - I'm just um I have a pink eye right now
16:23 - I got it from my kids or conjunctivitis
16:26 - whatever you want to call it and it's
16:28 - very contagious so I don't want to
16:29 - spread it around to my co-workers so
16:31 - that's why I'm working from home so so
16:35 - I'm fine to work I don't feel sick it's
16:37 - just my eyes are really red and swollen
16:41 - so anyway I should be fine by next week
16:45 - and and everything should be back to
16:49 - normal
16:55 - so let me go over the the WordPress API
16:58 - just very quickly probably just about
17:01 - five minutes mears's says there's hardly
17:06 - any buffering on 144 P but I feel like I
17:10 - need new glasses yeah awesome so if you
17:14 - wanted to to perform really well drop it
17:17 - down to 144 p and and that should work
17:20 - so alright but let me bring up I know I
17:24 - already have open on on one of my tabs
17:26 - one of my screens somewhere I have the
17:28 - WordPress API stuff open to see it
17:32 - alright so I'm going to bring this over
17:33 - on this screen just so you can see this
17:37 - is the output that I get from WordPress
17:40 - in JSON format and let let me make this
17:44 - as big as I can so this is the the
17:49 - parsed version I mean this is really how
17:51 - it comes just this big string here but
17:54 - it's it's JSON data and you can see I
17:58 - get this this is a custom post type that
18:02 - I set up it's the major event custom
18:04 - post type so basically I get the title I
18:07 - get the content of the post here
18:09 - including the HTML tags and then I have
18:14 - some custom things coming in just from
18:17 - some plugins that I did so one plug-in I
18:19 - actually made myself and then the other
18:22 - plugins I found that other people would
18:23 - made to work with the WordPress API so I
18:27 - get some extra data about my images that
18:29 - I have attached to this this post and
18:34 - just some extra fields I'm using the
18:37 - advanced custom fields plug-in I get
18:39 - some extra fields here that I added in
18:41 - here so this is what it looks like I'll
18:44 - show you in WordPress what I have going
18:47 - on okay yeah let me show you it's not if
18:56 - you have a newer version of WordPress so
19:01 - let me show you really it's the plugins
19:04 - that that matter so I'm not
19:08 - I don't even have everything active yet
19:11 - so I have some plugins that are for for
19:15 - caching and things that I don't even
19:16 - have activated yet but I will activate
19:18 - it at some point but it used to be met
19:23 - like a year ago if you wanted to use the
19:25 - API you actually had to download a
19:27 - plug-in to activate the API now it's
19:30 - part of WordPress core so you don't if
19:37 - you have WordPress and you've updated
19:38 - and updated it anytime probably within
19:41 - the last few months or so then you
19:45 - already have the WordPress API it's
19:47 - already working you don't have to do
19:49 - anything to get it to work all you have
19:52 - to do is go and I'll go back here just
19:55 - briefly I know it's going to be hard to
19:57 - see this so I'll read it out as much as
20:00 - I can here this is just the address of
20:02 - my wordpress site which in this case is
20:04 - WP KDK Dexcom and then you type in slash
20:08 - WP - JSON / WP / v2 and then you
20:16 - probably don't you you may not have any
20:18 - custom post types but you will just have
20:20 - regular posts or pages so if you type in
20:22 - slash posts then you'll get the list so
20:26 - if you went into your browser right now
20:28 - and you had a wordpress site running and
20:30 - you typed in what I what I just said
20:33 - then you would automatically get a list
20:36 - of your post in JSON format so it's that
20:40 - easy and in fact if if you don't have a
20:42 - wordpress site running in you act you
20:44 - typed in what I have here for this
20:46 - WordPress site you would be able to see
20:48 - it as well this is totally open it's you
20:50 - know it's public publicly accessible so
20:56 - it's it's super easy now I've customized
21:00 - mine a bit so I'm using the advanced
21:03 - custom fields plug-in to add some fields
21:06 - to my post type so I've I've added in
21:09 - some custom post types myself with and
21:13 - that's the only plug-in that I did you
21:15 - know completely custom it's the the to
21:18 - actually make the custom post types I
21:19 - did it in a plugin
21:21 - and I can show that I'm lucky I wonder
21:25 - if I have if I still have it up and I
21:27 - haven't closed it out I'll show it looks
21:30 - like I closed it out so maybe maybe I'll
21:33 - just show a little bit of it but if the
21:35 - quality is bad it's going to be hard to
21:37 - read it anyway so when I when I get down
21:39 - to that plugin maybe I'll show you a
21:40 - little bit of code how I did it so
21:44 - basically I'm using advanced custom
21:46 - fields and then I have this extra plugin
21:48 - to just expose those fields to the REST
21:50 - API which is why I can see them in my
21:52 - API I normally by default the API
21:57 - doesn't give you the URL of the image it
22:00 - just tells you hey here's an image and
22:02 - here's the you know the number of the
22:04 - image so it's not really that useful so
22:08 - I have this better featured images that
22:10 - gives me a lot of extra data about the
22:13 - images and URLs for all the different
22:16 - sizes of the image that exists so it's a
22:18 - a lot more useful here's the the custom
22:23 - plug-in that I made so let's let's go to
22:27 - the editor screen on this just to show
22:29 - you what it's like so making a plug-in
22:34 - in WordPress yourself is super easy you
22:36 - just pop this stuff at the beginning I
22:39 - mean you got to have the you're p8 it's
22:41 - it's all in PHP so you have to know a
22:43 - little bit about PHP at least and you
22:46 - just put this stuff at the beginning
22:48 - just to name your plug-in a little
22:50 - description and author name and then
22:53 - here I actually I left this in comment
22:56 - it out just as a template just to show
22:58 - so if you want to do a custom post type
23:02 - you just use the function create new
23:04 - type and then you can set up all your
23:12 - labels so these labels like this is how
23:14 - it'll appear in the in the admin panel
23:18 - okay so however you want it to display
23:21 - that's how you you put it up just on the
23:24 - back end in the admin panel for
23:25 - WordPress and then these here are more
23:29 - like what it will actually do
23:31 - like what the slugs going to be how it
23:34 - will show up on the API and and if
23:38 - you're doing some other PHP code with it
23:43 - you can tell it what it supports so what
23:46 - fields you want it to be able to use of
23:48 - the normal field so in this case I
23:50 - wanted to use the title field I wanted
23:52 - it to be able to use the the regular
23:55 - editor the excerpt field and then the
23:58 - thumbnail you can assign it taxonomy x'
24:02 - and you can also do custom taxonomies if
24:05 - you want so i actually did in this case
24:06 - I had some custom taxonomies one name
24:09 - brand one name body material options
24:12 - this was I pulled this from another site
24:14 - that I did I just copied the same
24:16 - plug-in and changed I just edited it to
24:19 - fit what I needed for this site you can
24:23 - exclude from search if you want this one
24:28 - you need it's a show and rest we do want
24:30 - it to show up in the rest api so we hit
24:32 - true ok we want it show up in the menu
24:35 - as well so that's it and that's
24:38 - basically you make a post down here
24:40 - below you need to let me scroll down so
24:46 - at the very end you need to add the
24:49 - action ok so you need to create the new
24:51 - type so you don't have to do it every
24:53 - time you see I just put all these
24:55 - together I lump them all together and
24:57 - then I just did it once
25:02 - I also did some taxonomy so I'm not
25:04 - using custom taxonomies for this site
25:06 - but I had them it was already in the
25:08 - plug-in so I just left it in commented
25:11 - out in case I in case I really you know
25:14 - wanted to use it later on it would be
25:15 - easy so this is how you do a taxonomy it
25:22 - it's pretty similar you know you're just
25:24 - setting you know here's how it's going
25:26 - to display and you know here's some of
25:31 - the values I want to show it and rest I
25:33 - want to show it in the menu all here's
25:35 - what the slug is going to be and so not
25:37 - not terrible to do if if you if you see
25:40 - it done once you can just copy and paste
25:42 - and change the values and it's
25:44 - it was super easy this is just a little
25:48 - custom thing that I needed I didn't want
25:52 - to display the normal title field in my
25:54 - post my custom post I wanted it to be
25:56 - different so this like automatically
25:58 - changes that so but that's that's pretty
26:02 - much it for that plug-in I'm going to
26:04 - check the live chat just in case I've
26:05 - totally lost somebody okay yeah no John
26:14 - says buffering has stops on 720p so
26:17 - that's awesome so maybe changing that
26:19 - setting did help a bit ghetto Street
26:24 - says not WordPress yeah this is not
26:28 - going to be about WordPress I just
26:29 - wanted to go over it quickly because I
26:31 - had I had a request to go over the
26:33 - WordPress API just really quickly some
26:36 - of the other plugins I'm using that
26:37 - makes this easier I'm using this filter
26:41 - field WP REST API filter fields this
26:45 - lets me return only the fields that I
26:48 - want so I can make the the response the
26:53 - JSON response that I get from WordPress
26:55 - when I make that call is going to be a
26:58 - lot smaller because I'm cutting out all
27:00 - the things that I don't need I'm only
27:02 - getting the data that I do need so
27:03 - that's really useful pure taxonomy x'
27:07 - this allows me to get normally you by
27:11 - default you don't get a lot of
27:13 - information about the taxonomy x' back
27:15 - you just get the number of like the ID
27:18 - number of that taxonomy which is not
27:20 - that useful if you want the actual like
27:23 - slugs for the taxonomy x' which is more
27:26 - useful you can use this plug-in to get
27:29 - to get that I'm talking about like if
27:32 - you want the actual name of the tag
27:34 - instead of just the number of that tag
27:37 - or that category you can use that here's
27:41 - the cash that I have when I activate
27:43 - this the the rest api calls will be
27:47 - cached so it doesn't actually have to go
27:50 - to the database and get the information
27:52 - to put together the
27:54 - the json data once that's already been
27:57 - done
27:58 - it'll be cached and then that will be
28:00 - ready so I'm going to do that I'm going
28:02 - to edit the plug-in a little bit because
28:04 - I wanted to
28:06 - when WordPress gets updated I want to
28:08 - automatically flush the cache so that
28:10 - the people editing these posts don't
28:13 - have to remember to flush the cache
28:15 - themselves so other than that small edit
28:18 - which on the github page for this
28:22 - plug-in it actually walks you through
28:23 - how to do that edit I'm basically just
28:26 - going to use this plug-in as is I just
28:30 - don't have it activated now because
28:31 - there's still a lot of content being
28:33 - added um
28:38 - filter tools okay this just adds in when
28:43 - I first started using the API some of
28:46 - the the way you made an API call was
28:48 - different and then they switched it and
28:52 - I just didn't feel like learning the new
28:54 - way so I downloaded this so that I could
28:56 - keep using the old way so eventually
28:58 - I'll learn the new way and I probably
28:59 - won't use this but for now just save me
29:01 - a little bit of time and this is
29:04 - multiple post types so normally you need
29:06 - to make one call one API call per post
29:09 - type well that stinks because you don't
29:12 - want to have to make another call but
29:14 - also in in next which is what we're
29:18 - using that's that's kind of what we use
29:23 - to bootstrap our react project here
29:26 - their default method of making API calls
29:29 - and having that work with server-side
29:31 - rendering only lets you make one API
29:33 - call so you you want to only make one
29:40 - I'm actually still working on trying to
29:42 - figure out how to make multiple API
29:44 - calls and make that work and I did I
29:46 - read something recently that made me
29:48 - think that it's possible but I haven't
29:50 - been able to get it to work yet so this
29:53 - this helps out because when I on pages
29:56 - where I need to make multiple calls get
29:58 - multiple post types I can get it there
30:00 - so anyway so that's how I have it set up
30:03 - you don't need any of these plugins to
30:06 - make the API
30:07 - work this just makes they all just make
30:09 - it easier to work with the API and
30:11 - easier to customize it you could you
30:14 - could do all this yourself if you were
30:17 - really good with PHP and with WordPress
30:19 - and not use other people's plugins but
30:21 - it saves me a lot of time because I'm
30:24 - not I'm just a very like very much a
30:28 - beginner with PHP so I don't I'm not
30:31 - really confident that I could do all
30:32 - that myself without it taking forever
30:37 - all right so that's it for the wordpress
30:42 - part of this hopefully whoever was
30:48 - interested in the API I I gave you
30:50 - enough here that you could you know get
30:52 - started and work with it a little bit
30:53 - let me know if you have any questions
30:55 - I've been working with it for um at
30:59 - least a year now maybe a little over a
31:01 - year yeah actually it has been more like
31:05 - a year and a half now that I've been
31:06 - working with the API so not non-expert
31:09 - but I definitely have some experience
31:11 - with it I'll shoot so aim high says too
31:17 - much buffering so it looks like the
31:18 - stream is getting bad again let me check
31:27 - the the status here
31:33 - yeah it's definitely below yeah it's
31:39 - it's getting the the problem it looks
31:43 - like I'm looking at some of the data of
31:47 - like what I'm outputting on my end and
31:50 - it seems like the problem is it's just
31:53 - fluctuating so much on average I'm it's
31:59 - like a decent stream but it it drops
32:03 - down really low and then it'll go up
32:05 - really high back and forth so I'm I'm
32:08 - really sorry about the stream what I'm
32:10 - going to do at this point I mean we
32:14 - actually don't even have that many
32:15 - viewers so I'm assuming that probably
32:18 - the stream is that bad that I'm just
32:19 - losing people because this is way below
32:21 - the normal amount of viewers that I have
32:24 - so I think
32:37 - sorry I was just reading the live chat
32:39 - again
32:40 - yeah the WordPress site is hosted on
32:43 - digitalocean that the site that I just
32:45 - showed you is on digitalocean so I'm
32:50 - going to get rid of this stuff we don't
32:55 - need that the the actual setting up of
33:00 - the the load balancer is for the SSL is
33:05 - going to be pretty simple I think we can
33:07 - get through it pretty quickly
33:09 - so all right since the streams getting
33:14 - worse okay um if it's getting worse than
33:27 - alright let me I think I'm gonna put
33:29 - this up to a vote in the live chat
33:31 - because I'm really I'm torn on this and
33:33 - I can't see what you're seeing so I I'm
33:35 - not really feeling how bad this stream
33:37 - really is if it's that bad I'm gonna put
33:40 - it up to a vote and I'm gonna give maybe
33:41 - like three minutes or so before I make a
33:44 - decision should I go through with
33:48 - setting up this load balancer completely
33:53 - with the SSO and everything even though
33:56 - the the stream quality is pretty low or
33:58 - should I shut down the stream and just
34:04 - do it right now and make a video or
34:06 - option three should I just wait and do
34:10 - it next week whenever I'm at a better
34:13 - connection okay so I have one one vote
34:20 - here aim high says can we reset
34:22 - reschedule the stream I can definitely
34:24 - reschedule it I will have to reschedule
34:26 - for next week because I won't be I won't
34:29 - be able to get anywhere with the good
34:31 - connection until until Monday so I know
34:40 - there's there's going to be a delay
34:41 - until everyone can respond to that
34:43 - question so I'm just going to wait a
34:46 - minute for for that I feel really bad
34:50 - about this
34:51 - I know I even I mentioned yesterday I
34:53 - was going to do this we're going to set
34:55 - up this load balance balancer so I'm
34:58 - really sorry that this is not working
35:00 - out the stream was not nearly this bad
35:02 - yesterday okay Patrick says keep going
35:13 - so we're splitting up
35:40 - okay I'll give it just just a little bit
35:43 - longer to see if anyone else responds
35:50 - okay now it says the stream is getting
35:52 - better see that's it's just it just
35:54 - keeps going back and forth as being
35:56 - really good and really bad I tell you
35:59 - what I think I'm gonna go for it I'm
36:02 - gonna try to get go through this and
36:04 - then after I'm done I'll check out the
36:07 - video and just see what the quality is
36:09 - if the quality is terrible even on the
36:11 - recording then maybe I'll just I'll
36:14 - rerecord it or I'll do it
36:16 - I'll go through it again like maybe when
36:18 - I stream on Monday we'll take like the
36:20 - first part of it and I'll just review
36:22 - what what we did just kind of really
36:24 - quickly and then that way you know maybe
36:29 - there are some people that are getting a
36:30 - decent stream so so let's go for it so
36:35 - if you see here I'm in the basically the
36:39 - same screen we left off at yesterday we
36:43 - had I think we left off here actually so
36:45 - here's our two our two droplets that we
36:49 - had cloned and it's being we have the
36:52 - load being balanced between these two
36:54 - they're both up the only thing that I
36:56 - did differently is I started the the
37:01 - node server with p.m. - and on this one
37:06 - it just started just straight out with
37:10 - just the the regular server so basically
37:14 - the only difference is this this is
37:18 - being this process is being run by by
37:20 - p.m. - it'll like Auto restart and
37:22 - things like that so not really a big
37:24 - deal and so no no really significant
37:26 - changes so I have linked in the
37:30 - description to this video kind of the
37:33 - the digitalocean instructions for
37:35 - setting up an SSL pass through on their
37:37 - load balancers so if you want to follow
37:40 - along with that or read some more
37:42 - details as we're going then you know go
37:44 - ahead and click that link I'm going to
37:46 - keep it on my other screen so there'll
37:49 - be more room to actually see you know
37:51 - what I'm
37:53 - but right now we were going past step
37:57 - one we've already completed a lot of
37:59 - these steps so I'm going to scroll down
38:02 - all the way to let's go is step three
38:13 - we've assigned okay so step three is
38:15 - assigning the domain name to the load
38:17 - balancer so we have assigned a sub
38:23 - domain to the load balancer so it was
38:25 - test Caddick addicts calm and yesterday
38:29 - I think some people were able to go to
38:31 - that and it worked I was not able to go
38:34 - to that it didn't work for me I think it
38:36 - was just a caching thing so if you go to
38:41 - that and it works great I'm just I'm
38:44 - going to assume that it works because
38:45 - it's not really you just point the you
38:49 - know the a record to to the domain name
38:52 - of the load balancer so I'm going to go
39:01 - back out to the the actual load balancer
39:03 - here just to say so that's the domain
39:08 - name that we pointed to so for me I'm
39:11 - just going to go to that domain name
39:12 - just to show like hey it's working still
39:14 - just to verify that but you should also
39:18 - be able to go to test dot katic addicts
39:22 - calm and it should work like I said it's
39:25 - not working for me
39:40 - all right so now we I'm going to skip
39:46 - step three just for a minute okay we
39:48 - know that we're going to have to point
39:49 - that a record of the main domain name so
39:52 - just catechetical comm we're going to
39:54 - have to point that soon but I'm going to
39:56 - skip ahead a little bit
39:57 - step four configuring nginx to use the
40:00 - SSO so we've already configured this
40:04 - before if you remember yesterday we just
40:06 - commented out all the SSL stuff so to go
40:09 - back in all we have to do is just take
40:16 - out the comment tags which in free nginx
40:21 - config it's just a hash tag so we just
40:23 - need to take out those hash tags and
40:25 - then it should work again we've already
40:27 - copied over all the SSL configs from
40:30 - that that original droplet that's live
40:32 - right now in khattak addicts comm so
40:35 - everything's set up so that's why I say
40:37 - this is going to be actually pretty easy
40:39 - because we don't even have to generate
40:41 - new certificates or anything so almost
40:43 - all the steps we don't need really the
40:46 - only two steps we're going to have to to
40:50 - worry about for this is I think step six
40:55 - which is actually adding the SSL
40:59 - pass-through rule to the load balancer
41:00 - and then we are going to have to point
41:03 - the the correct domain name so this
41:06 - needs to be done quickly I don't want
41:08 - the main site to be down for too long so
41:12 - what I'm going to do first is
41:20 - the first thing I'm going to do is
41:22 - change the records so I'm going to bring
41:29 - this over and this is our our second
41:34 - droplet right now which we have we have
41:36 - it running and I'm going to go in here
41:40 - I'm going to go to that configuration
41:41 - file that we edited and I'm going to
41:43 - enable the SSL stuff again I'm going to
41:49 - do this ahead of time now I'm doing the
41:51 - steps out of order but I want there to
41:52 - be as little downtime as possible so I'm
41:54 - going to do this first and then I'm
41:58 - going to switch the the domain name so
42:02 - I'm going to go in okay Patrick said the
42:06 - test domain worked briefly and then an
42:08 - unexpected error occurred huh that's
42:15 - interesting
42:16 - I wonder what's going on with that's
42:24 - just it's just really odd because
42:26 - obviously the load balancer itself seems
42:29 - to be working and I'm not even getting
42:34 - it saying this site can't be reached
42:37 - I'm getting an entirely different error
42:39 - Patrick whenever you get that error is
42:41 - it like basically a gray screen with
42:44 - just some text right in the middle like
42:45 - centered in the middle saying and
42:47 - unexpected errors occurred okay it works
42:49 - for Sebastian okay so does Patrick's and
42:54 - unexpected errors occur it sounds like
42:56 - it's the error that comes through when
42:58 - when there's a problem with node like
43:00 - there was some type of issue so yeah
43:04 - refreshing it blinks the site and then
43:06 - blows up Patrick can I ask a what
43:09 - browser are you using and do you know
43:14 - what version of that browser it is I'm
43:17 - just I'm thinking maybe there is some
43:19 - some issue with my site that I don't
43:21 - know about I guess I should ask too if
43:23 - you go to catechin x-com without the
43:26 - test does that work for you Sebastian
43:30 - says that error happened yesterday after
43:33 - you
43:33 - set it up alright so I'm not sure I'm
43:47 - not sure what that area is let me um I'm
43:54 - gonna go here on another browser and
44:05 - just to see I just kind of wonder like
44:09 - maybe one of the okay Patrick says never
44:18 - mind you block origin was blocking
44:21 - CloudFlare it works after white
44:22 - listening it okay cool so hopefully we
44:26 - that area is not an issue I guess we'll
44:29 - find out so anyway so let me bring my
44:34 - terminal back over and I know I said at
44:38 - the beginning I talked about changing
44:40 - the color but I guess the when I changed
44:42 - the color it only applied to this one
44:44 - tab so I'm not going to take the time to
44:46 - change it again after fresh okay Patrick
44:55 - is using Chrome it should definitely
44:56 - work with Chrome
45:05 - ok so I think it's going to be fine
45:07 - think it'll work so I'm gonna do the I'm
45:10 - actually gonna check the live chat from
45:15 - yesterday I had it somewhere did I have
45:22 - it here yeah I have it
45:26 - okay so Oh actually I just saw this
45:29 - right before I am right before I started
45:31 - the stream so I just wanted to share
45:33 - this with you all I'm not really looking
45:35 - for work right now
45:36 - but this came up when I was looking at
45:38 - Stack Overflow on something and this
45:40 - looks like an amazing job like the
45:42 - salaries awesome its remote work or if
45:45 - you want to go there it's in Florida
45:46 - which was just a nice place to be all of
45:50 - it just looks really basic like they
45:52 - want basic HTML CSS JavaScript they
45:55 - mentioned like jQuery in here really
45:58 - simple stuff they use WordPress so
46:02 - anyway check that out senior website
46:04 - developer at Central reach they said
46:07 - they're taking as long as you have like
46:08 - two years experience there they're
46:11 - taking that so anyway check that out I'm
46:17 - not affiliated with them at all I just
46:19 - saw that and thought that's a great
46:20 - opportunity I would like to share with
46:22 - you all so I'm gonna check here's the
46:27 - live stream from yesterday so I actually
46:30 - saved the live streams because I don't
46:31 - always get to read everything and I want
46:33 - to make sure that I see everything and
46:35 - can can answer questions in case I
46:38 - forgot so I'm going back here just
46:40 - because there were a lot of good
46:42 - commands that I use yesterday that I
46:45 - want to use again today and
46:53 - I think yeah it was it was something
47:05 - like / you're not gonna I think my fines
47:14 - not going to work for this command
47:16 - because it's altogether
47:32 - I was trying to get around having to
47:34 - look up how to get to the config file
47:38 - and I can't find it for some reason so I
47:43 - will just go in here and try to remember
47:47 - what it was I think I can so um sudo
47:51 - nano um
47:58 - TC and was it engine X yeah it was and
48:03 - it was sites um enabled and then default
48:12 - that's it
48:16 - all right I should have should have more
48:18 - confidence in myself that I remember
48:20 - that so okay so here's our config file
48:25 - so like I said I'm just going to go in
48:27 - here and I'm going to take out all those
48:29 - places where I I commented some things
48:35 - out and then this should make it so that
48:41 - it has the exact same setup as are our
48:45 - main server which is what we want I'm
48:48 - only going to do this for one of these
48:50 - because we're going to we're going to
48:53 - end up deleting the third droplet that
48:57 - we set up because I'm only going to run
48:59 - two so I so can say yeah we should be
49:09 - good when we do these few last few lines
49:13 - and then we should be good and I'm just
49:17 - going to format that a little better
49:19 - alright and that's it that's that's the
49:21 - only thing we changed yesterday so to
49:27 - get out of nano you hit control X and
49:29 - then yes and yeah we want to rewrite
49:32 - that all right so now we need to restart
49:35 - nginx and that
49:39 - I'll probably have to pseudo this sitio
49:45 - [Music]
49:50 - no I spelled it wrong
49:57 - there we go okay
50:06 - all right so now this should be set up
50:12 - the way we want it to be able to use the
50:17 - main address that we want with with our
50:25 - SSL so these are we going to do I'm
50:28 - going to say this out loud so I have it
50:30 - right in my head the steps that we need
50:33 - to take because I want them to all to go
50:34 - really smoothly so we have minimal
50:36 - downtime so what we're going to do then
50:39 - is we need to remove we need to point
50:43 - the main domain catechetical comm to
50:45 - this IP address we need to remove the
50:52 - load the the droplet 3 so I'm sorry I'm
51:01 - getting distracted I've gotten calls
51:02 - from my wife and now my my mother-in-law
51:07 - so I just want to make sure everything's
51:11 - all right let me my wife left a message
51:16 - so I'm just going to listen to it well
51:18 - while I'm doing this to make sure that
51:21 - you know none of my kids are got hurt or
51:24 - anything
51:31 - and it sounds like I have like two
51:34 - minutes of just random noise in the
51:40 - background so alright it sounds like my
51:45 - wife accidentally called me and then
51:47 - left left a message
51:52 - sounds like the baby's crying in the
51:54 - background okay so I guess I'm assuming
51:59 - that that's if that was a mistake and
52:07 - then the same thing it seems like my
52:10 - mother-in-law accidentally called me as
52:11 - well and left a message that's an insane
52:14 - coincidence so sorry about the
52:17 - interruption but I was just worried that
52:19 - I got two calls right then since I know
52:21 - that my wife knows I'm streaming right
52:23 - now alright so we're going to remove
52:28 - this this droplet we're going to add our
52:33 - original droplet so we'll have these two
52:36 - and we need to set up the rules the past
52:40 - three rules on our our load balancer
52:47 - okay so let's do that so let me go here
52:52 - let me log in I'm going to log in to our
53:00 - domain name registrar so that we can
53:06 - change where the main names pointing the
53:11 - only good thing is for a lot of people
53:12 - it's going to be cash so if we mess it
53:14 - up some people won't even notice that we
53:19 - messed it up because they'll still be
53:20 - going you know pointing to a different
53:22 - place so we should be okay at least for
53:25 - a little it'll buy us some time
53:27 - normally the the caching messes me up
53:31 - because I can't tell whether I've done
53:33 - something right or not but in this case
53:35 - it may be helpful
53:52 - okay so on my other screen I'm gonna do
53:54 - the login and then I'll bring it over
54:24 - know if anybody else uses UNAM for
54:27 - hosting but their site just seems really
54:29 - slow or not for hosting but for domains
54:34 - I mean okay so here's what we need to do
54:42 - all right hey Thor how's it going Thor
54:44 - just joined us um yeah actually no I'm
54:49 - not I'm not early he said that I'm
54:52 - earlier he's late to a start time was
54:56 - 2:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time so right
55:02 - now it's 3:00 p.m. Eastern almost 3:00
55:06 - so we actually haven't gotten through
55:09 - that much yet we had some more technical
55:12 - difficulties which basically just my
55:13 - network is not really great right now
55:15 - but we're at the point now where we're
55:19 - going to point the main domain to our
55:23 - load balancer and then we're going to
55:26 - set up the rules for the SSL pass
55:28 - through and hopefully it'll work so I'm
55:30 - going to go here and copy I'm going to
55:35 - copy this IP address and then I should
55:42 - be the same IP address for this test and
55:45 - that one but just on the off chance that
55:47 - I had it wrong I wanted to copy the
55:50 - original okay so I'm going to save that
55:57 - hopefully I don't get you no calls and
56:00 - messages immediately from people at work
56:03 - saying the site's down what's going on
56:06 - that actually happens really often when
56:08 - I do something like this it's like 30
56:11 - seconds after it's down somebody happens
56:13 - to look at it all right so that's there
56:16 - let's move we need to move our droplet
56:24 - over let's add our original CI droplet
56:33 - let's remove
56:37 - this droplet okay great and why I see I
56:43 - react down No
56:54 - okay so for some reason that's down
56:56 - maybe the move made it down briefly I
56:59 - can I can go into there quickly if I
57:03 - need to and see what's going on let me
57:10 - at least set up these rules for now
57:13 - because we still have one that that's up
57:16 - and running so let's go actually a thing
57:21 - I just need to go to settings alright
57:26 - and if you're following along in the
57:27 - documentation I believe we're on step 6
57:32 - yes we're on step 6 okay so we need to
57:36 - go to this forwarding rules and edit
57:39 - those and we need to add a new rule for
57:43 - HTTP and we need to pass 9 I need to not
57:49 - a new certificate I need to pass through
57:51 - there we go and we don't we want port
57:56 - there we go HTTP should be port 443 I'm
58:04 - going to save that rule ok
58:07 - that's been updated and that should be
58:13 - it that should be all we need to do so
58:15 - let me check it out
58:23 - all right so this is at least still
58:25 - working although like I said there could
58:28 - be some caching stuff so that may not be
58:31 - the best test I do want to go back out
58:34 - here to our droplets and see if we still
58:38 - have one down
58:38 - no and that actually came back up so the
58:40 - down time must have just been temporary
58:42 - due to the switch behind the load
58:44 - balancer so what I want to do now is I
58:51 - would like to purposely bring one of
58:53 - these droplets down and make changes
58:59 - also on one of the droplets that I don't
59:02 - make on the other one just to kind of
59:04 - get a test of like is the load balancing
59:07 - really working are we going to have
59:10 - downtime still so I want to see make
59:13 - sure this works like like we wanted to
59:14 - do where we have zero downtime even if
59:16 - one goes down temporarily so let's come
59:22 - over first test and let me go to this
59:27 - original so here's the original I know
59:30 - this is super small so let me make this
59:32 - bigger
59:39 - goodness alright alright so that's a bit
59:45 - bigger probably can do do a little more
59:48 - okay so I can do p.m. to stop next okay
59:57 - so that should be stopped so since that
59:59 - stopped if we go to catechetical comm
60:02 - it's just still work I'm going to click
60:05 - around normally if it stops I can get
60:09 - maybe like 2 or 3 pages that have been
60:11 - cached and with our service worker and
60:14 - then the rest don't work so right now it
60:17 - looks like it's ok I'm going to go in on
60:20 - my other screen in an incognito window
60:22 - and Chrome and try it here as well oh
60:27 - it's not working there so we did get a
60:30 - bad gateway so let's see might have an
60:35 - issue
60:40 - so it's giving us let me bring this over
60:43 - I'm getting a 502 bad gateway error when
60:48 - I try to visit this site from here let
60:58 - me do a another refresh here
61:10 - okay yeah it's it's still working here
61:14 - but I'm assuming that this is some type
61:17 - of caching thing that's making it still
61:19 - work since I'm not getting you know
61:21 - basically since I'm getting the error
61:23 - okay and I'm starting to get some weird
61:25 - stuff happening here okay so let's see
61:33 - something's not working Thor says it's
61:41 - working so are you are you saying the
61:44 - site's working for you I do want to make
61:49 - sure I don't know that these IP
61:50 - adjusters will even work anymore since
61:52 - they're behind the the load balancer all
61:56 - right so I'm not sure what's going on
61:59 - here with that IP address worked and it
62:01 - shouldn't because I did just bring down
62:03 - that that server I don't know why it's
62:06 - still saying it's healthy to should not
62:09 - be healthy what is going on
62:16 - did I not bring that down it should be
62:20 - stopped yeah yeah it's it it stops what
62:27 - is going on
62:34 - yeah this is okay so Thor mentions in
62:37 - the live chat it seems like the load
62:39 - balancing does act actually does not
62:41 - recognize the 5:02 as unhealthy so that
62:47 - was a thing yesterday we had we had
62:51 - tested it out and it seemed like it was
62:55 - recognizing the the bad gateway error as
63:00 - the droplet actually being down but now
63:05 - it seems like that's not the case so I'm
63:07 - going to bring this back up I'm going to
63:12 - bring this back up and see if I can get
63:14 - rid of that error just to make sure that
63:18 - this is possibly what we're doing now
63:20 - but yeah look at this as soon as I
63:24 - brought that up immediately it started
63:26 - working again so yeah so this tells me
63:36 - at least this hints to the fact that
63:38 - maybe it is not recognizing that so what
63:41 - I'm going to do now is I'm going to shut
63:43 - down nginx so there's this droplet will
63:46 - actually be completely offline it should
63:49 - show up as being totally down so what's
63:54 - the what's the command I'm gonna have to
63:56 - look up the command for how to stop
63:58 - nginx I assume it's just stopped yeah
64:24 - okay so now we should be getting a
64:29 - message that this is down I think it
64:38 - does update automatically I shouldn't
64:39 - have to refresh it but I was just in
64:44 - patient and where they wanted to see
64:46 - looks like something went wrong that's
64:50 - not what I want to see networking
64:57 - domains
65:07 - hmm what happened
65:21 - this is really weird because when I when
65:31 - I go to networking I should get I should
65:35 - get an option to go to load balancers so
65:37 - this is really weird
66:17 - who
66:49 - de Rohan glad you could join us
66:55 - Rohan just joined in the live chat and
66:57 - said said I'm late okay so in case you
67:04 - didn't catch what just happened here the
67:07 - way to get to the the admin panel for
67:13 - load balancing and digitalocean is to go
67:15 - to networking and then there should be
67:18 - an option to go to the load balancer so
67:22 - you'll I'll show you here this is what
67:30 - it should look like I should click
67:31 - networking and then I should have this
67:33 - here what's happened now is that I don't
67:36 - have that it's not showing that at all
67:42 - so I can't even get in to see what's
67:45 - going on I'm gonna go I'm just gonna
67:52 - switch try to figure out something here
67:57 - now as far as I can tell it's still
68:01 - running all right so it's still working
68:09 - because we did shut down we did shut
68:14 - down nginx on our main droplet but on
68:21 - our secondary droplet it's still running
68:24 - so both the node server and nginx are
68:28 - still running so I'm just going to
68:34 - verify that yeah it's still running so
68:37 - it's probably directing everything to
68:39 - there so it seems like it's still
68:41 - working let me know in the live chat if
68:44 - you tried to go there Khattak addicts
68:46 - comm and if it's not working for you but
68:50 - I am a little bit I'm going to leave
68:53 - this up just in case we need to switch
68:54 - back the the test doc addict addicts
68:59 - calm
69:01 - I don't know I mean that's still
69:04 - pointing to a load balancer so me I
69:07 - don't know what would happen if it went
69:08 - that looks like you want to be topless
69:12 - this is my own actually don't even have
69:15 - any droplets going right now okay so I
69:17 - went I've switched to my own account my
69:19 - personal account and yeah so this is
69:21 - what it's supposed to look like I don't
69:23 - know why it didn't work so I'm going to
69:25 - switch back to my work account and go to
69:36 - networking there we go okay maybe it was
69:38 - just some some glitch in the digital
69:42 - ocean UI let's see I wonder if they
69:45 - built this with this is actually react
69:46 - so I don't know if you can see this it's
69:48 - really small but this plugin shows me
69:50 - with this built with so that's pretty
69:53 - cool that this this in fact is a the
69:58 - front-end is react very cool and it
70:04 - looks like they use jQuery and react
70:05 - together just like just like I did on
70:08 - this site so I'm not the only one it
70:10 - uses it even though it's probably better
70:12 - not to all right so let's check out the
70:15 - load balancers it says there's an issue
70:17 - that's that's what I want to say here we
70:19 - go and this should be down okay so
70:25 - what's this is saying Eric connection
70:28 - refused Sebastian says he got an error
70:32 - connection refused when you try to go to
70:34 - the site it's working for Thor for Julio
70:40 - it's working uh and he's in Chile or how
70:47 - do you actually pronounce Chile if you
70:50 - live there is it is it chill a or I
70:52 - think that's how you pronounce it I
70:54 - don't want to be like mispronouncing
70:57 - your country and being disrespectful
71:00 - like that so let me know okay so
71:15 - so it is chilly not chilly okay thank
71:21 - you I thought it was I I remember when I
71:24 - took a bunch of Spanish courses and we
71:28 - would I'm pretty sure that's how it was
71:31 - pronounced in those courses so sorry I
71:34 - mispronounced that at first all right so
71:38 - all right it's decides not working for
71:42 - Rohan I wonder
71:54 - okay Carlo says it's up in Brazil here's
71:59 - what I'm wondering I don't know maybe
72:02 - this is not possible
72:03 - but if like let's say that the old IP
72:10 - address is is cached as where the a
72:13 - records should be pointing to then maybe
72:18 - maybe that's causing an error so for
72:21 - those of you who aren't able to get to
72:22 - the site try this out go to type in this
72:28 - IP address if I'm going to zoom in so
72:30 - you can see it and I'm also going to say
72:32 - it just in case you can't see this forty
72:35 - 5.50 5.1 19.1 42 because that should
72:43 - regardless of any caching issues that
72:45 - should take you directly to the load
72:47 - balancer if that works for you then then
72:52 - we should be good temporarily they'll
72:54 - probably be some people who can't reach
72:56 - the site until the until the caching has
73:00 - run its course thanks Laura Thorpe that
73:04 - the IP address on the live chat so you
73:06 - can just copy and paste that and let me
73:09 - know if that works it's actually super
73:13 - helpful having so many of you testing
73:15 - this out right here I mean otherwise it
73:19 - would it would be nearly impossible for
73:21 - me to get you know instantaneous
73:23 - feedback from people all over the world
73:25 - on whether or not this was working so so
73:29 - this is awesome thank you
73:40 - okay so Sebastian says the IP is
73:44 - redirecting to Khattak addicts calm
73:47 - which is giving an error for Rohan it
73:52 - did work now alright um so but I I doubt
73:59 - it's it's a browser error but on the off
74:02 - chance that it is web browser are you
74:03 - using Sebastian
74:18 - and I'm going to try I'm just going to
74:23 - try it out in some other browsers so my
74:26 - other screen so this should be actually
74:33 - I'll show you so I'm going to use opera
74:36 - now and I set up the VPN to be like as
74:38 - if it's coming from somewhere else so
74:40 - I'm thinking that that should hopefully
74:43 - get over any caching things as well just
74:46 - to check it out okay so that's working
74:52 - and I think I can set let's set it to
74:57 - come from somewhere really far away from
74:59 - where I am so let's try it from a
75:01 - Singapore
75:17 - okay so that's working cool it's
75:20 - actually why they're not loading there
75:25 - should be an image right there so I'm
75:28 - not sure why it's not loading that image
75:44 - because that's the wrong that's the
75:50 - wrong URL oh I see what happened
75:53 - I recently edited this image I optimized
76:00 - it and so I needed to change the name
76:02 - here and I guess I forgot that I had
76:05 - been using media queries and had it in
76:07 - those as well so I guess on certain
76:09 - screen sizes that image isn't showing up
76:12 - let me test that out by expanding it
76:16 - maybe let me go to an interior page -
76:22 - yeah okay - so it does work I just for
76:26 - that particular page I forgot to change
76:28 - it I'll have to make sure I change that
76:30 - so I'm going to add that to my list
76:31 - right now so don't forget it add it to
76:35 - the to the Trello board
76:54 - okay
76:59 - okay so Sebastian said he tested on
77:05 - Chrome an edge so I'm assuming it
77:07 - doesn't work on either one Thor says
77:10 - it's definitely a DNS cache error which
77:13 - I'm hoping it's that because then that
77:16 - means I didn't do anything wrong
77:18 - and it'll just resolve itself with time
77:23 - rohan says if he uses 4g and row on i'm
77:28 - assuming that this is a he correct me if
77:30 - if you're not a he but I'm assuming
77:36 - Rohan this is a boy's name so so on 4G
77:47 - it won't load but it works on the the
77:50 - home broadband okay so yeah so this does
77:55 - seem like I agree with Thor here it does
77:58 - seem like a DNS thing since there
77:59 - doesn't seem to be I mean it's it with
78:04 - browsers and everything okay so Rohan is
78:07 - in fact it's it's he feel awesome
78:13 - sorry about that that's just not really
78:15 - a common name where I'm from so just
78:19 - wanted to be sure
78:27 - I've only heard the name Rohan two other
78:29 - times and one is from the the country in
78:33 - Lord of the Rings and the other one is a
78:35 - character's name in a cartoon Melissa
78:41 - called Legend of Korra that I watched it
78:44 - with my kids okay Sebastian asks he said
78:53 - yesterday we set up a load balancer on
78:54 - react to and react three but now it's on
78:57 - CI react in C Iraq too and it does work
79:01 - on Sebastian's fund okay so I'm going
79:03 - with DNS error so I'll probably check it
79:07 - again but only on 4G it works so what
79:14 - we'll do is it won't really work for me
79:17 - to keep checking it since it is working
79:19 - for me I guess I could try it on my 4G
79:23 - quickly just to see since I can't get
79:25 - the error I won't be able to check but
79:28 - what we can do is on Monday when I
79:31 - stream on Monday then if any of you can
79:35 - join me on Monday as well then
79:36 - especially those of you who are having
79:38 - the errors now we can see if you still
79:40 - have the errors or if they work because
79:42 - by the time Monday comes around if it
79:45 - hasn't sorted itself out then I have to
79:49 - look for a different different cause for
79:51 - the error because it definitely should
79:52 - have sorted itself out by then so right
79:55 - now I'm checking on my phone on my 4G
79:58 - network okay so it does work on my
80:05 - network so there's really not any good
80:07 - way that I know of for me to test this
80:10 - error since I can't recreate it so it's
80:12 - it's just going to have to wait I'm just
80:15 - going to have to give it some time and
80:17 - check it out
80:24 - but anyway to answer Sebastien's going
80:26 - to question confusion so yeah what we
80:29 - did and let me go back to this just in
80:32 - case you didn't you didn't catch what we
80:37 - did you didn't see it maybe you're just
80:38 - joining in a little bit later so
80:41 - initially did we ever turn that back on
80:44 - I don't think we did let me turn that
80:47 - back on because there's no reason for
80:49 - that to be down right I felt yeah we did
80:54 - turn it back on maybe it just wasn't
80:57 - showing up oh we turned off nginx I need
81:00 - to start nginx again so
81:13 - no I spelled it wrong didn't I
81:29 - there we go okay so hopefully that will
81:31 - come back on here in a minute
81:34 - so what we did was for testing we were
81:38 - using react the CI react to and then we
81:41 - had a CI react three but we had gotten
81:44 - to the point where I mean it's pretty
81:45 - confident that the load balancer was
81:47 - working we were able to go to the IP
81:49 - address of the load balancer it worked
81:50 - when one was down so that part was
81:52 - working I couldn't really test very much
81:54 - else out and that set up it was time to
81:57 - test out the SSL so this is now set to
82:02 - run this is the main droplet that was on
82:06 - I honestly could have just used two and
82:09 - three and not brought this in and left
82:11 - out too it was just I would rather have
82:13 - it be CI react in CI react to rather
82:16 - than two and three so it's just kind of
82:18 - a naming thing for me but it definitely
82:20 - could have worked with the other ones I
82:23 - didn't have to pull that one out so I
82:29 - guess to be honest with you in hindsight
82:31 - it may have been better to just set it
82:34 - up on two and three redirect everything
82:36 - and then that way at least if the DNS
82:39 - was still going to the IP address for
82:42 - this droplet it still would have worked
82:44 - so that may have been a mistake on my
82:46 - part I probably could have avoided some
82:48 - downtime if I would have just kept it
82:51 - going with the two and three I just it
82:54 - was just slightly less work for me
82:55 - because I wouldn't have to go in and
82:57 - edit the config file for nginx for the
83:00 - CI react three so so actually thanks for
83:07 - asking that Sebastian because now after
83:09 - I kind of talked through that I realized
83:11 - that that that was a mistake I should
83:13 - have left this one as is so that it
83:18 - could handle any other requests coming
83:21 - from if this this IP address was still
83:25 - in the DNS cache so I could probably
83:30 - move this out again and it would work I
83:33 - wonder at this point if it's even worth
83:35 - it because the cache should not last for
83:37 - that much longer
83:41 - Oh Patrick says he has a nephew named
83:46 - Rohan
83:47 - in my neck of the woods which is
83:49 - Pittsburgh so yeah I'm actually really
83:51 - close to Pittsburgh my wife and kids are
83:54 - in Pittsburgh right now so really a
83:58 - short drive depending on traffic takes
84:02 - me maybe like a half an hour to get into
84:04 - Pittsburgh from where I am so Rohan says
84:08 - it's a common name here in India most
84:10 - people from Europe or stateside call me
84:12 - Ron okay cool I mean I'll probably call
84:15 - you Rohan I don't have a problem with
84:17 - that I like the name
84:20 - oh okay Sebastian says now that I turn
84:26 - enginex back on it does work so I want
84:31 - to actually am really curious to see if
84:34 - I can reach this site from the IP
84:37 - address though and I can okay so I take
84:41 - back what I just said about three
84:42 - minutes ago I had thought that I've made
84:45 - a mistake by doing this but it seems
84:46 - like you actually still can reach this
84:49 - droplet with the IP address for that so
84:55 - I guess it works so I guess it would not
84:57 - have made a difference and this was
84:59 - still probably the most efficient way to
85:01 - do it I mean really only saved me maybe
85:06 - a minute and a half of work to do it
85:09 - like this as opposed to keeping the
85:11 - third one but yeah okay so we have them
85:14 - both healthy now
85:15 - what I need to remember to do though so
85:17 - if you remember the original intent of
85:19 - me doing this load balancing was to
85:20 - avoid any downtime when I updated the
85:23 - site because I had 30 to 45 seconds of
85:25 - downtime whenever I was rebuilding the
85:29 - react app so I wanted to avoid that
85:33 - downtime so I figured if I set up load
85:35 - balancing I could update one droplet and
85:38 - then all the traffic could go to the
85:41 - other droplet and then I would switch
85:42 - droplets update like that the problem is
85:46 - that the load balancer is not
85:47 - recognizing when I take node down
85:49 - because nginx is still running even
85:52 - though it's giving an error it's
85:54 - running so what I need to do is add
85:55 - another step to my update process where
85:58 - I actually shut down nginx
86:00 - in addition to shutting down node that
86:03 - is not really going to be a big deal
86:05 - because I have all my commands chained
86:08 - and I literally just copy and paste a
86:11 - big chain of commands when it comes time
86:13 - to update and I don't need to do
86:16 - anything and then I will probably find
86:18 - out a better way to update in time right
86:22 - now I just haven't decided on anything
86:24 - but I'm going to look through some of
86:26 - the suggestions that I was given
86:27 - yesterday and the live chat as well so
86:30 - this should work out I just need to add
86:32 - a step and I thought I think we've
86:36 - accomplished what what I wanted to
86:39 - accomplish and this actually did take
86:43 - longer than expected but a lot of that
86:47 - was just due to the technical
86:48 - difficulties on my end and just kind of
86:51 - more testing and making sure everything
86:53 - was working all right so we've reached
87:01 - the end I'm quickly going to go through
87:03 - and check and see if there's any
87:04 - questions in the live chat that I missed
87:06 - I don't remember really seeing any
87:07 - questions but you never know III
87:09 - definitely could have missed it so at
87:11 - this point if you were just here for the
87:16 - setting up the load balancer and you
87:18 - don't really care to stick around for
87:19 - the questions thanks for watching and
87:21 - I'll be back on Monday at 2 p.m. Eastern
87:23 - Time
87:25 - I'll post the topic on on Twitter
87:29 - sometime on Monday to let you know what
87:32 - I'll be working on then otherwise if you
87:34 - have any questions put them in the live
87:36 - chat now and I will I will answer if you
87:43 - don't want to put your question in the
87:44 - live chat you can put it in the comments
87:46 - below the video and if you don't want
87:48 - everybody to see your question just
87:50 - direct message me on Twitter
87:52 - my the link to my Twitter account is in
87:55 - the description for this video okay so
87:59 - I'm checking the live chat most of it at
88:01 - the beginning is just you all helping me
88:04 - to figure out if my
88:07 - if my video was was any good if the
88:11 - quality was any good looking through
88:14 - this chat it's just crazy it's like a
88:16 - wave between it's working it's not
88:18 - working it's working it's not working so
88:22 - sorry again for that I know I apologized
88:24 - already but I do feel really bad the
88:29 - shot really that much I could do about
88:31 - it I can't I got a stream from home
88:33 - today
89:22 - okay so I've got through pretty much
89:26 - pretty much everything in the live chat
89:28 - now I'm just going down okay Sebastian
89:31 - said he sent me a DM okay I'll check
89:35 - that out as soon as the streams over
89:39 - unless you want me to check it out now
89:40 - and answer you on the stream let me know
89:43 - Martin asks what is SSL so SSL secure
89:50 - socket layer correct me if that's not
89:53 - the right term so basically like when
89:54 - you go to a website and it has the
89:56 - little green like HTTPS with the lock on
89:59 - it it has an SSL certificate all right
90:02 - that basically it's showing that the
90:04 - data is encrypted and I see some of you
90:08 - are already answering Martin as well so
90:10 - make sure you know check out the answers
90:13 - here because there are a lot of very
90:15 - knowledgeable people in the live chat
90:16 - right now but yeah that's what you need
90:21 - if you want your website to be encrypted
90:23 - and to have HTTPS PS show up instead of
90:26 - just regular HTTP you need an SSL
90:29 - certificate I did do a video I think two
90:35 - weeks ago where I set up an SSL
90:37 - certificate so check that out it's when
90:40 - I was setting up initially setting up
90:41 - the servers if you want to know more
90:43 - about how to set it up and I went
90:44 - through how to set up a free SSL
90:47 - certificate there are paid ones that you
90:50 - can get
90:56 - yeah Martin don't worry about it I asked
90:58 - for questions so you can certainly look
91:01 - out up if you want but I don't mind
91:06 - answering it right now
91:19 - yeah so yeah Martin so that's I mean
91:23 - that's pretty much all I know about SSL
91:25 - so I don't know any of the details about
91:26 - like how the encryption works or
91:28 - anything like that but if you have if
91:34 - you're taking any type of user data like
91:38 - in a forum or something or like
91:40 - especially credit card data definitely
91:43 - want to get an SSL I recommend having an
91:48 - SSL on any site now because of search
91:52 - engine optimization I Google search
91:56 - engine ranking algorithm is always like
91:58 - clouded in secrecy but we know that
92:02 - having an SSO is a factor we don't know
92:05 - how big of a factor it is but it could
92:07 - you know potentially help your rankings
92:09 - your search engine ranking so I
92:11 - recommend it for that
92:12 - I also recommend it for just in general
92:17 - like confidence in browsers now you know
92:21 - it's definitely very visible whether
92:23 - site has an SSL or not so even if you're
92:26 - not gathering user data your users are
92:29 - going to feel better on your site I mean
92:31 - not everybody but I certainly feel
92:32 - better on sites that that I see have the
92:36 - SSL especially because you can get an
92:38 - SSL for free now it just almost seems
92:41 - like you know if I go to the site where
92:43 - there's not an SSL I wonder like why
92:45 - didn't they take the time to do that
92:47 - because it's so easy to set up now and
92:50 - it's free you know you may as well just
92:52 - do it so even if they're not gathering
92:55 - my data it just does make me wonder like
92:57 - it's such a small thing and it's so
92:59 - common now like you know you think that
93:02 - they would take a step you know that
93:04 - just a little extra step to make you
93:06 - feel more comfortable so I definitely
93:08 - recommend it like if you're doing a
93:10 - commercial site a hundred percent
93:12 - recommend it but if if you can spare a
93:15 - few extra you know minutes and really
93:18 - depending on who you're hosting your
93:19 - site with it can be as simple as just a
93:22 - few minutes to set it up sometimes it
93:24 - could be a little bit longer but I would
93:26 - say
93:28 - you know it's probably not going to take
93:30 - any more than an hour to set it up even
93:32 - if you're doing it for the first time
93:34 - it's really it's really simple I will
93:37 - say this though depending on who you
93:39 - host your site with they may not allow
93:41 - you to do the free SSL you may have to
93:43 - pay for one I know I have some stuff
93:47 - hosted on shared hosting with GoDaddy
93:49 - and at least the last time I checked I
93:52 - was not allowed to set up a free SSL
93:55 - certificate but on other shared hosts
93:58 - like SiteGround I am able to setup a
94:01 - free SSL and they make it really easy I
94:03 - just have to click a button and they
94:05 - handle everything for me so it depends
94:08 - on your hosts certainly if your hosting
94:09 - with digitalocean you have full control
94:11 - over your server you have you can set it
94:13 - up it takes a little bit more work but
94:15 - you can set up the free SSL let's see
94:28 - I'm just checking the the chat again
94:33 - yeah so Mark Martin and Thor are having
94:36 - a little disagreement here I'm just I'm
94:38 - just going to weigh in a little bit I
94:40 - mean Thor III definitely I understand
94:44 - where you're coming from
94:45 - but at the same time I did ask for
94:47 - questions so I'm not I'm not mad at all
94:50 - at Martin for asking a question that may
94:53 - seem to some people like kind of an easy
94:58 - question because I mean I would always
95:00 - just keep in mind like you don't you
95:03 - don't know where people are at so it
95:05 - seems like an easy question one person
95:07 - may not at all seem like an easy
95:09 - question to another person so especially
95:13 - if you've never worked with SSL before
95:15 - like you know a few years ago setting up
95:20 - an SSL certificate was a really
95:21 - difficult question to me now that I've
95:23 - done it you know I don't know six maybe
95:28 - six times maybe more on digital ocean
95:31 - and done paid certificates and stuff it
95:34 - doesn't seem like a big deal to me but
95:37 - you know you just can't expect it this
95:41 - is my opinion now
95:42 - obviously I'm certainly open hearing
95:44 - other opinions but I don't necessarily
95:47 - think it's fair to expect people to know
95:51 - whether or not a question is an easy
95:54 - question or not
95:55 - so definitely because I asked for
95:58 - questions and the topic you know the
96:00 - title of this video has the word SSL in
96:02 - it so to ask a question like what is SSL
96:05 - is definitely relevant to this so so
96:10 - just so everybody knows I will take any
96:12 - question pretty much on here and I'm not
96:15 - going to get mad if you ask a question
96:16 - that I've answered before or that seems
96:19 - really simple it doesn't bother me at
96:22 - all I used to teach high school so I'm
96:26 - like almost positive I'm not going to
96:28 - get a question here on this channel that
96:30 - is that is worse than some of the
96:34 - questions that I got when I taught high
96:36 - school I mean I love my students but
96:39 - occasionally you would just like get the
96:41 - craziest stuff so that's my opinion you
96:45 - know I'm not worried about it and Thor
96:47 - I'm not trying to say that you're wrong
96:48 - about it - you're certainly entitled to
96:50 - your own opinion you might have your own
96:52 - experiences with that so but at least on
96:54 - this forum on my on my shows feel free
96:59 - to ask whatever you want and I'll do my
97:03 - best to answer it
97:07 - Rohan says I know this is a this is from
97:11 - a project but I'd love some regular back
97:13 - end and maybe networking walkthrough
97:15 - stuff there aren't many good quality
97:17 - stuff out there and most of them are
97:18 - really old all right cool that's good to
97:21 - know I do have a list of topics that I
97:24 - would like to make videos on probably
97:27 - not live streams my live streams are
97:29 - always just going to at least for now
97:31 - they're going to be related to whatever
97:33 - I'm working on that day because the idea
97:34 - behind these streams were I want people
97:40 - to see what my day-to-day work is like
97:41 - because I think it'd be useful for
97:44 - people who are interested in front-end
97:45 - development or people who just like me
97:47 - were kind of a lone to see what it's
97:51 - like for other people to do their jobs
97:53 - so
97:55 - want to keep the livestreams like that
97:56 - but I would love to do something like
97:58 - pre-recorded videos of on specific
98:02 - topics and have them be a little bit
98:04 - more focused sometimes the streams can
98:05 - be all over the place because I'm
98:07 - answering questions and stuff so it's a
98:09 - little bit scattered and I know that
98:11 - probably is annoying to some people you
98:13 - know they don't have a lot of time they
98:15 - want to come to learn something specific
98:17 - and then they hear me going on and on
98:18 - about some totally different on the live
98:20 - stream so I'd love to do some videos
98:23 - that will be more focused and hopefully
98:26 - a little bit shorter but more to the
98:28 - point on specific things so I will add
98:31 - your suggestions Rohan to that list I
98:36 - just haven't got to making the videos
98:37 - yet because I've been working so much on
98:40 - this site now that it's actually
98:42 - launched and I'm just kind of I still
98:44 - have a long list of things that need to
98:46 - be added and changes that need to be
98:47 - made but I don't have to go it's quite
98:49 - near the same pace so now I will be able
98:53 - to start making some of those videos I
98:55 - actually wanted to sort them this week
98:57 - but then I couldn't go into work and at
98:59 - home it's just way too noisy with all my
99:02 - kids and everything the only reason I've
99:05 - been able even do the streams is because
99:06 - my wife has taken the kids somewhere
99:08 - else during the stream time so I should
99:10 - be back into the office next week and
99:12 - should definitely be able to get some of
99:14 - those videos made and those will be on
99:16 - the list some some more back-end
99:18 - networking things I'll have to do my
99:20 - homework on it as well because that's
99:21 - not what I normally do but I'll try to
99:23 - do my best and I get you some good
99:25 - information yeah good point Rohan I
99:33 - didn't mention that CloudFlare Rohan
99:35 - says CloudFlare and let's encrypt are
99:37 - really easy and free for SSL so yeah so
99:41 - for this particular project I used let's
99:43 - encrypts to set it up and there are some
99:46 - there's some really good documentation
99:47 - from digitalocean on how to set that up
99:50 - so if you just literally if you look up
99:53 - and I think I link to this in some of my
99:55 - previous videos about setting up a
99:57 - server so you can check that or if you
100:00 - search digitalocean
100:01 - how to set up an SSL and then just put
100:04 - like the name so if you're using nginx a
100:06 - how to set up as a cell with nginx
100:08 - using Apache say how to do with Apache
100:10 - you'll find an article with it try to
100:12 - find one of the newest one is and then
100:15 - it'll take you through step by step it's
100:17 - super easy I've been able to get a plus
100:18 - scores for my SSL certificates just from
100:22 - following some of the instructions on
100:24 - digitalocean so yeah try that out don't
100:28 - spend money on an SSL unless you really
100:30 - have to because the free ones are are
100:33 - certainly they do the job also
100:37 - CloudFlare that would be even easier to
100:39 - set up so check out CloudFlare you can
100:41 - route your your name servers to
100:44 - CloudFlare and then point them once
100:47 - they're there CloudFlare then you can
100:49 - point your your a records to your server
100:53 - so all the traffic will go through
100:55 - CloudFlare so between the client and
100:58 - CloudFlare servers everything will be
101:00 - encrypted and then you don't even have
101:02 - to have an SSL on your own servers now
101:06 - the traffic between CloudFlare servers
101:08 - and your servers will be unencrypted if
101:10 - you do it like that but at least from a
101:12 - client's perspective it'll look like you
101:14 - have everything encrypted and if you're
101:16 - not really taking any data from the
101:17 - client then that's that's certainly an
101:20 - acceptable way to do it I wouldn't do it
101:22 - like that if I was taking credit card
101:23 - information but but that's definitely an
101:27 - easy way to do it
101:41 - okay cool it looks like Thor and Martin
101:44 - have kind of come to maybe a little
101:49 - agreement here and things have kind of
101:52 - cooled down so I thanks thanks guys for
101:55 - for working that out I like to see
101:58 - everybody getting along because I mean
102:00 - we're all just trying to learn and help
102:01 - each other here anyway so I mean not
102:04 - that arguments will arise I mean we're
102:07 - all just Rogers people right we're not
102:09 - perfect so arguments are going to happen
102:11 - but I don't I don't want to see the live
102:15 - chat for my shares turn into anything
102:17 - that's kind of like aggressive and
102:19 - people feel like they they can't be open
102:22 - and asking things so this at least
102:25 - should be a nice place for people who of
102:29 - all skill levels to come and not feel
102:31 - like they need to be ashamed of
102:35 - what they know or don't know so Rohan's
102:41 - now says I can learn the basics online
102:44 - but there aren't really any intermediate
102:46 - level stuff out there there's just basic
102:48 - and over the top expert level stuff yeah
102:51 - I definitely understand what you're
102:52 - saying there it can be hard there's a
102:54 - lot of basic stuff that's really easy
102:56 - and and you feel accomplished you know
102:58 - you do the the basic tutorials and then
103:02 - yeah you're right there's stuff out
103:03 - there that's just super hard to
103:04 - understand in at eye level though how do
103:08 - you get from one point to the other so
103:10 - yeah I mean if if this if my stuff can
103:13 - be kind of that intermediate thing
103:15 - because honestly I would consider I
103:17 - would consider myself to be entering
103:20 - into that intermediate level you know
103:22 - I've been doing this for a while you
103:23 - know I've been making a making sites the
103:26 - sites work you know I'm getting good
103:27 - feedback from them so I'm definitely
103:30 - past that beginner stage iving you know
103:32 - I'm not in the you know tutorial level
103:35 - of doing you know like code Academy
103:37 - tutorials and stuff which there's
103:39 - nothing wrong with those I did all the
103:41 - code Academy tutorials and occasionally
103:42 - I still go back to them if they do a new
103:44 - one but you know I'm past that level but
103:48 - I don't I'm not at the level of like
103:50 - getting pool requests accepted into
103:53 - major projects on github
103:54 - and things like that and really like you
103:58 - know doing some cutting edge you know
104:00 - amazing stuff so hopefully I can you
104:04 - know if there's not good resources for
104:05 - that level out there hopefully this can
104:08 - be a good resource I definitely want
104:10 - this to be useful to people with if it's
104:12 - not useful then I'll probably stop doing
104:13 - it so if there's uh okay uh rhoann add
104:23 - one more comment I think this will be
104:25 - the last comment unless somebody else
104:26 - says anything and then we'll wrap it up
104:28 - Rowan says he's a student and can't
104:31 - afford all the like the intermediate
104:33 - courses that are usually too expensive
104:35 - so I agree with you there I shine away
104:39 - from the paid courses not that I don't
104:42 - feel like they're valuable or I don't
104:44 - want to can you know I'd love to
104:46 - contribute to somebody who's putting
104:47 - their time and effort into something
104:49 - really useful you know so I'm not saying
104:51 - don't pay for courses but for me like
104:54 - you know I'm you know I got a family I
104:58 - got four kids and a wife and everything
105:00 - if I don't need to spend money on that
105:02 - that means more money that can go
105:04 - towards my family so and I'm not I'm not
105:09 - wealthy at least by American standards
105:11 - so yes I mean I'm always looking out for
105:16 - the free stuff you know as long as it's
105:20 - good so yeah my stuff I don't have any
105:25 - plans to make any of my stuff paid at
105:27 - any point
105:27 - I mean maybe like maybe at some point if
105:31 - I really want to do like some of those
105:34 - affiliate link things that you see
105:35 - people do I don't know but I don't have
105:39 - any plans to make money off of this so
105:41 - it's going to be free at least for the
105:43 - you know foreseeable future I mean maybe
105:45 - if I started doing this a lot like if
105:48 - most of my day was taken up by this kind
105:50 - of thing then it might make sense to do
105:52 - some paid stuff but at this time you
105:56 - know even if you don't have that much
105:57 - money I'll I'll at least help you out as
105:59 - much as I can
106:03 - Martin mentions out of college for a
106:05 - year and in the same place
106:07 - with meaning like in that intermediate
106:09 - level above the tutorial level can't get
106:12 - a job called college 100% way CS
106:15 - decrease don't anything yeah so I am I
106:21 - also I don't have a computer science
106:23 - degree I have a business degree so if I
106:25 - think I mumbled that last thing a little
106:27 - bit so Martin's comment was college 100
106:30 - was 100 percent waste and CS degrees
106:32 - don't do anything so I can't comment
106:35 - directly on that because I don't have a
106:37 - CS degree but I did it do you have a
106:39 - business degree I will tell you I would
106:41 - not have been able to get the job I have
106:42 - now unless I had a degree it didn't have
106:45 - to be a computer science degree but I
106:47 - had to have some degree now I do work at
106:49 - a university so they're a little bit at
106:52 - a university everybody has to have a
106:54 - degree right and I've actually had
106:56 - opportunities and been asked if I was
106:58 - interested in teaching this I can't
107:01 - teach because I don't have my masters so
107:03 - I can actually get hired to do this job
107:06 - for the university but I can't be hired
107:09 - to teach people how to do the same job
107:11 - so I mean I think it has to do with
107:14 - accreditation or something so I'm not
107:16 - upset about it anything I'm not really
107:17 - sure if I'd want to teach anyway but
107:19 - there are some places that will require
107:22 - a degree no matter what even if it if it
107:25 - doesn't make any sense so in that sense
107:28 - a degree is not necessarily a total
107:30 - waste also I would say depending on the
107:34 - program a computer science degree
107:36 - wouldn't be a total waste there are
107:37 - definitely some programs in call in
107:40 - schools that are very prestigious and
107:43 - the companies will see and they'll be
107:45 - impressed that you got a degree from
107:46 - that particular program like near me
107:49 - there's Carnegie Mellon they have a
107:52 - really good reputation I know the top
107:54 - tech companies frequently hire people
107:56 - from Carnegie Mellon both students and
107:58 - professors from Carnegie Mellon so and
108:01 - there are other schools like that you
108:03 - know probably it throughout the you know
108:04 - the United States is probably you know
108:06 - also throughout the world so depending
108:09 - on what field you're trying to get like
108:11 - you're obviously trying to get a tech
108:13 - job but you know if you want to get into
108:16 - a specific field like if you wanted to
108:18 - get into education you probably need a
108:19 - degree
108:20 - probably government as well they would
108:22 - look more to degree so I just kind of
108:24 - depends so I wouldn't I wouldn't say
108:26 - it's a hundred percent of waste I I
108:28 - would not go back and get a computer
108:30 - science degree at this point the only
108:32 - way I would I would see computer science
108:34 - degree being of value to me right now is
108:38 - if I wanted to teach I would go get my
108:41 - master's in computer science so just it
108:44 - does kind of depend what your goals are
108:46 - and where you're at already but but it
108:51 - would be more or less useful depending
108:53 - on where you're at Roland says yeah I
108:58 - mean last year degree was a total waste
109:00 - so it's either stuff I already knew or
109:03 - old stuff that nobody cares but having a
109:05 - degree is very important in Asia okay
109:11 - okay so Hardin says schools like that
109:15 - are all about prestige and grades and
109:16 - stuff I thought I would see students as
109:18 - the stuff didn't appeal to me yeah
109:21 - that's true to get into really
109:22 - prestigious schools you do have to be
109:24 - like really good with the grade so that
109:27 - is not for everybody to get into so yeah
109:34 - but I think the any degree can at least
109:41 - be helpful because there are still some
109:42 - companies some institutions out there
109:45 - that will refuse to hire somebody
109:47 - without at least a bachelor's degree so
109:50 - that being said even if you got a degree
109:53 - in anything it could still be helpful
109:56 - now the nice thing about this field is
110:00 - there's a lot of places that do hire
110:02 - without a degree so if you don't have
110:04 - the degree don't worry about it you can
110:07 - probably still get a job if you do have
110:09 - a degree then that gives you a little
110:12 - bit more opportunity than the people
110:14 - that don't so it's probably not a total
110:16 - total waste but it's actually I'm
110:22 - actually trying to address that at the
110:24 - school I'm at
110:25 - I'm working on setting up internships
110:28 - for the computer science students to
110:30 - work on these same projects that I'm
110:32 - working on so they can get some
110:33 - real-world experience and some things in
110:36 - their portfolio because if you just go
110:40 - through your computer science classes
110:41 - and you don't do anything extra you
110:44 - would have the degree but you wouldn't
110:45 - necessarily have a nice portfolio and
110:47 - that's what companies care about more I
110:50 - think a lot of companies care more about
110:51 - the what work have you actually done I
110:54 - know where we're hiring a web developer
110:58 - right now at my university and I'm
111:00 - involved in the hiring process and I've
111:02 - been sorting through resumes and for me
111:05 - personally I don't care where the degree
111:08 - is from at all I don't even look at that
111:10 - part of the resume it is a requirement
111:14 - yeah I think a degrees a requirement
111:16 - there might be an exception for like if
111:18 - you have a lot of experience you don't
111:20 - necessarily need to have the four-year
111:21 - degree but I don't even look at it what
111:24 - I want to see is do you have a link to
111:27 - your github profile if not automatically
111:30 - I'm a little bit skeptical because I
111:32 - think you know what one does this person
111:35 - not even know what github is do I really
111:37 - want to have them working here or two if
111:39 - they do have a github but they don't
111:41 - have any code on it or they're
111:42 - embarrassed by the code and don't want
111:43 - to tell me about it then what does that
111:45 - say so work on definitely work on your
111:49 - portfolio regardless of whether you're
111:51 - in a computer science program or not
111:52 - because that's going to be the the most
111:54 - important thing
112:07 - okay Martin says I'm probably going to
112:10 - wrap this up soon because it's been a
112:12 - really long stream so just a few more
112:13 - comments Martin says grades are
112:17 - nonsensical measure of absolutely
112:19 - nothing as that's harsh
112:21 - I mean that but you are right in a sense
112:25 - I don't necessarily think grades are a
112:27 - good indicator of your success on the
112:30 - job all the time I know I have I have a
112:33 - family member who I helped out a lot in
112:37 - high school and in college to help him
112:39 - get the grades enough to pass and like
112:41 - it was just barely passing and he's had
112:44 - no problem getting jobs right off the
112:46 - bat you know getting jobs good jobs and
112:51 - it's able to just move from job to job
112:53 - getting better jobs and he's great at it
112:56 - and he was never great at school I was I
113:00 - graduated at the top of my class in
113:03 - college where they call it assume summa
113:07 -  laude a so top of everything for six
113:09 - months I couldn't find a job at all the
113:11 - first job I got was a assistant manager
113:15 - at a Burger King
113:16 - it's a fast-food restaurant so and I
113:20 - actually end up quitting that job in a
113:21 - few months and taking a job as a waiter
113:23 - at a restaurant because it was actually
113:25 - better and I could make more money so I
113:28 - definitely say yes like grades are not
113:30 - necessarily a good indicator of your
113:32 - ability to get a job or to do well at a
113:34 - job so so I agree with that
113:40 - Rowan says getting a BS degree this year
113:43 - would love to get a masters degree
113:44 - really only edge about actually getting
113:46 - into it for it I would say row on it
113:48 - just it depends on what you want to do
113:50 - really for computer science related
113:53 - stuff I don't think a master's is worth
113:57 - it in terms of the time and the money it
113:59 - takes to get it unless you have a job in
114:02 - mind that you know needs that master's
114:04 - so for instance teaching would
114:06 - definitely need it or if you know
114:09 - there's a company want to work for that
114:10 - requires that so I would weigh that
114:13 - that out because it's definitely you
114:15 - know your time your your
114:17 - all the money will take to pay for the
114:19 - school but you're also losing out on the
114:21 - money you would make during that same
114:22 - amount of time assuming that you could
114:24 - get a job so it's a big I mean it's a
114:27 - big investment and a big sacrifice to go
114:29 - for that master's degree so if that's
114:33 - what you want and it's going to get you
114:35 - to the place you want to go then go for
114:37 - it but otherwise you know definitely you
114:39 - know do the math on that and weigh that
114:40 - before you make a decision on it yeah
114:51 - Martin mentions shouldn't have to do the
114:53 - extra work went to school to get a job
114:54 - and I completed the steps yeah I think
114:57 - that's like that's the big thing that
115:01 - people are realizing now like I'm um I'm
115:05 - 31 and when I came up through like high
115:09 - school
115:11 - the idea was you know you go to college
115:14 - you put in your time you get your degree
115:16 - you get the job but then as I was
115:19 - starting to get up like later in high
115:20 - school and even into college um started
115:24 - to realize that's not necessarily how it
115:26 - works and then now since I've been out
115:27 - of school what's getting even worse and
115:29 - I think it's the case now that going to
115:31 - college does not guarantee you a job
115:33 - anymore maybe it did at some point in
115:38 - the past but now that is not the case
115:40 - you need to do you know you don't you
115:44 - need to in addition to being in college
115:46 - you need to have good internships and
115:47 - you need to have good connections and
115:49 - you know that's um that's just the way
115:55 - it is I honestly think having good
115:58 - connections is more important than
116:01 - pretty much anything else if you're
116:05 - doing computer science stuff having a
116:06 - good portfolio and work is is probably
116:09 - right up there maybe tied with your
116:11 - connections but that's kind of the way
116:13 - it is so if you're in school now if
116:16 - you're thinking about going to school
116:18 - going to college you know definitely
116:20 - take that into consideration going
116:23 - through college even if you're at the
116:24 - top of your class it doesn't guarantee
116:26 - you anything in terms of jobs
116:29 - it definitely didn't help me
116:30 - in terms of getting a job and you know
116:35 - like I said I wouldn't have gotten this
116:36 - job unless I had a degree but it didn't
116:38 - really matter at all that what the
116:43 - degree was or what I was you know it was
116:45 - just like I had to have it so I'm gonna
116:52 - check back in the live chat just keeps I
116:56 - can't get to the end they're just more
116:57 - keeps keeps coming so let me cut this
117:00 - once we hit four o'clock I'm just going
117:02 - to cut it off because that would have
117:03 - been like that's a two-hour stream
117:05 - that's pretty pretty long especially if
117:06 - this ends up being low-quality I don't
117:08 - want to have to have people suffer
117:10 - through two hours of a low-quality
117:11 - stream if they're going to watch this
117:12 - replay somebody asks a sin since in your
117:21 - case oh is that as is their playlist so
117:25 - I can watch this project start to finish
117:27 - yes there is on freako camp's channel
117:29 - there is a playlist it's called live
117:30 - coding with Jesse but the project
117:33 - actually started on my own YouTube
117:34 - channel so I link to that in the
117:37 - description for this video so if you
117:38 - want to start from the very beginning go
117:40 - to my own youtube channel and start with
117:42 - a video that's titled I think it's
117:44 - titled building a website as fast as I
117:46 - can
117:46 - because when I first got this project it
117:48 - was like hey can you do this project in
117:50 - like six days I did get a little bit
117:53 - extra time so that was good but start
117:56 - with that video and I think there's two
117:59 - videos on my channel and then I switched
118:01 - over and got invited to to do live
118:04 - streams on free code camp so now I've
118:06 - been doing on free code camp since then
118:11 - Martin Martin mention he says I'll never
118:13 - get a job world is messed up martin noth
118:15 - I definitely think you can get a job
118:18 - don't get discouraged and I've been
118:21 - there like I've been in your position in
118:23 - terms of being out of school not being
118:26 - able to find a job or being able to find
118:28 - jobs that aren't good that aren't what I
118:29 - want to do I've been there it's really
118:32 - tough and not just when I was out of
118:34 - school there was a time when I had a job
118:36 - for a while and then I quit that job and
118:38 - then I didn't have a job for a long time
118:40 - and I was just taking little side jobs
118:41 - doing websites here and there but we're
118:43 - like low-paying type of stuff and it was
118:45 - tough and at that point I had kids and
118:48 - everything and then it was really tough
118:50 - because it wasn't just me it was like I
118:52 - felt like I was letting down my family
118:54 - and my wife so I definitely can be
118:57 - really tough when you can't find a job
118:59 - but just you know don't give up and keep
119:00 - trying you know you're going to get a
119:03 - lot of rejection to keep applying to
119:05 - places and keep working on things you
119:09 - never know you know what'll lead to
119:12 - something you know I had a connection
119:14 - that you know my boss my current boss
119:17 - now I had I had kind of known you know I
119:22 - known him we had talked to you here and
119:23 - there we you know we lived in the same
119:25 - town but I actually got involved and we
119:27 - were both involved in the same volunteer
119:29 - organization before I got this job so we
119:32 - had already kind of built up a
119:33 - relationship and he knew he could trust
119:35 - me you know that I was I was a
119:38 - trustworthy person before I got this job
119:40 - so that I think kind of helped things
119:42 - because that's it's really hard to tell
119:44 - from a resume whether somebody's trust
119:46 - with you or not so you never know what
119:48 - kind of connections will will help you
119:50 - so you know just try to try to keep
119:53 - going keep working on projects and you
119:56 - know if you got to take some job that
119:57 - you don't really want to do to pay the
119:59 - bills you know go ahead and do it you
120:01 - never know
120:02 - it may help you out but just try not to
120:05 - get discouraged I know it's easy for me
120:06 - to say that it's but I've been there
120:09 - before
120:10 - so keep working through it you know
120:13 - you'll get something check out the the
120:15 - free code camp forums recently there's
120:18 - been a lot of good posts about people
120:20 - who have come through the same struggle
120:22 - and have finally found something and
120:23 - they talked about how they went about
120:25 - doing that the things they did that
120:27 - worked and didn't work so if you haven't
120:29 - already checked out that forum and read
120:30 - about some of that stuff I definitely
120:32 - recommend it there's some inspiring
120:33 - stuff in there and maybe may be helpful
120:37 - to you someone asks and I'm sorry I
120:43 - can't pronounce this name at all because
120:45 - it's not in the normal alphabet that I
120:48 - I know but is is Moscow State University
120:51 - well known in the USA I can honestly say
120:54 - that that sounds familiar like I've
120:56 - maybe heard it before but I don't think
120:59 - it's well known at least not to me in
121:01 - the USA
121:07 - Rohan says freelancing is great to make
121:09 - portfolio mostly for web devs yeah
121:11 - that's true that's how I built my
121:13 - portfolio up was through freelancing I
121:15 - like I had my own company kind of it so
121:20 - I called it Jessie why go digital
121:21 - marketing but in reality I was pretty
121:23 - much a freelancer so I was able to make
121:26 - a lot of good connections and improve
121:29 - with real work that I got paid for that
121:32 - I could do what you know that could do
121:34 - this job so that really did help when I
121:37 - got the job that I currently have now
121:38 - was being able to show my portfolio and
121:41 - what I'd done and when I was
121:42 - interviewing being able to reference you
121:44 - know hey I had this client before and we
121:46 - worked on this project and this is how
121:48 - he handled it because I did get
121:49 - questions about you know how did you how
121:52 - would you handle this if this happened
121:54 - and I was able to say well this actually
121:55 - did happen to me when I was working on
121:58 - this project and I could talk about what
122:00 - I did so you know freelancing is not
122:04 - freelancing was really tough like oh my
122:07 - family especially on my wife it you know
122:09 - she worried about it because you don't
122:10 - have guaranteed income you know one
122:12 - month you're doing well the next month
122:14 - you know you can barely buy any
122:16 - groceries you know so it's tough but in
122:20 - that in that sense and it's tough
122:23 - because you have to market yourself to
122:24 - people and I never liked that part of
122:26 - the job at all but but it can definitely
122:30 - be a way to get nice a nice experience
122:35 - and get paid
122:44 - okay Kenya says I'm a mathematician I
122:49 - found out that there's more work as a
122:51 - developer than mathematician unless it's
122:53 - in big data and stuff so I started free
122:55 - code camp and it's really good
122:57 - awesome yeah I'm glad that you like free
123:00 - code camp stuff so I did free code camp
123:03 - stuff and I definitely yeah I definitely
123:13 - recommend that I'm actually I never
123:17 - finished my free code camp like all the
123:19 - certifications you can get I really want
123:21 - to go back and do that at some point
123:23 - it's just it's hard to justify taking
123:25 - time to do that what I could be doing
123:27 - work that I'm getting paid for so I
123:29 - still really want to do it someday
123:31 - because I you know I just like free code
123:34 - camp so much it'd be great to be able to
123:37 - have a post one day and say hey look
123:39 - here's my certificate I think that would
123:42 - be cool
123:52 - yeah Kenya uh it's hard I feel very
123:55 - nervous and anxious to find a job I I
123:59 - know how you feel um yeah that
124:07 - nervousness is um that's tough it's
124:11 - tough to get over it's hard to put
124:13 - yourself out there you know and take the
124:15 - chance and then get disappointed with
124:17 - things so just keep on trying you know
124:20 - it gets easier the more you try to do it
124:22 - it'll get easier and even uh you know if
124:27 - you can't try to do something uh like
124:29 - this like I am you know live stream a
124:33 - YouTube video or like a meet-up or
124:35 - something like that where you can get
124:36 - out there with other people and it will
124:38 - help you feel a little bit more
124:39 - comfortable
124:39 - I was super kind of paranoid about other
124:43 - people seeing my code I thought like
124:47 - people will see my code and they'll like
124:49 - you know think it's terrible and then
124:51 - like they'll tell my boss there are
124:53 - employers that my code is terrible and
124:55 - then like I just had kind of this
124:58 - irrational fear of that and I remember
125:00 - about a year ago I was at a conference
125:02 - and someone told me I had kind of
125:06 - mentioned my my fear of this because I
125:07 - was even afraid to put my code on github
125:09 - I had stuff on github but it was in like
125:12 - private repositories and they you know
125:15 - they said I don't you know don't worry
125:17 - about it just you know put yourself out
125:18 - there and most people are going to be
125:19 - helpful and so what if some people were
125:21 - mean about it you know just you know
125:24 - don't don't be afraid to do that and I
125:26 - didn't act on that right away but I
125:28 - stayed in my mind and and they're not
125:32 - being really helpful advice and I
125:33 - actually I don't even remember the name
125:35 - of the person that told me that I wish I
125:36 - did but I'm really glad that they they
125:39 - did tell me that and that helped and
125:42 - then now you know a year later not only
125:44 - do I have stuff on github but I'm live
125:46 - coding you know on YouTube which you
125:50 - know it's kind of I guess even more of a
125:52 - scary situation because people can
125:54 - immediately tell me hey you're doing
125:56 - terrible stuff that's never happened but
126:00 - it's been remarkably positive feedback
126:03 - for me and it's
126:04 - it's helped me to get better but yeah I
126:09 - just the only way to get over the
126:11 - nervousness is just to get yourself out
126:13 - there and and just kind of face it
126:20 - awesome
126:22 - rohan says really good talking here um
126:26 - Tony since I have si and usually don't
126:29 - talk too much in chat so I feel good
126:31 - here I'm sorry what's si I'm blanking
126:33 - here what's that an abbreviation for
126:37 - situational anxiety is that maybe I'm
126:40 - not maybe that's it I don't know we'll
126:43 - see actually I am I definitely
126:46 - understand I have a son my oldest son
126:48 - has obsessive-compulsive disorder and
126:50 - has a lot of anxiety and so I have a lot
126:56 - of sympathy if anybody struggling with
127:00 - stuff like that
127:01 - I know it can be just super super hard
127:03 - and I know - I'm usually not it probably
127:07 - sounds weird because I'm doing stuff on
127:09 - YouTube now but I like never talk on you
127:13 - know online forms or chats and things
127:15 - like this I'm always like just kind of
127:18 - staying in the background but now that
127:24 - I'm doing more like this I just I wish I
127:27 - would have started sooner
127:34 - okay Rowland says I guess we should
127:36 - start a discord server so or an IRC yeah
127:39 - whatever
127:42 - whatever you all think would be the best
127:45 - way to do this to have a chat it would
127:48 - be kind of cool to have some sort of
127:53 - group to chat where it's you know it
127:57 - doesn't have to be just during the the
127:59 - livestream so let me know what you all
128:07 - decide and so I can I can join up
128:28 - okay so Thor says freako camp already
128:31 - does have a gator thing yeah that's true
128:33 - I forgot about that they do have get her
128:40 - okay
128:42 - Kenya says thank you she's really
128:44 - helpful
128:45 - I'm glad I'm glad I could be of help and
128:47 - you know feel free to ask anything or
128:50 - you can direct message me on Twitter
128:51 - whatever I ask it in the comments I'm
128:54 - more than happy to help FCC jesse is
129:04 - here just created okay cool
129:07 - so is this so we have hash tag FCC jesse
129:13 - sounds good that was created where are
129:15 - we still talking about gator or IRC I'll
129:23 - shoot it looks like the streams getting
129:25 - terrible again so maybe this would be a
129:30 - good time to wrap it up if the streams
129:32 - the stream quality is going down
129:35 - Oh on on freenode okay so so on freenode
129:42 - there is now a channel that's FCC jesse
129:47 - so FCC Jes si which I'm really flattered
129:51 - that the channel has my name in it but
129:55 - so yeah so if anybody is is still
129:59 - listening which we actually have picked
130:01 - up in viewers now it's I'm really
130:03 - surprised that now after two hours we
130:05 - picked up more viewers but not a lot of
130:08 - years not as much as usual but um yeah
130:12 - check it out on freenode channel FCC
130:15 - Jesse and we keep the chat going and I'm
130:18 - going to try to join in and just you
130:21 - know this chat I definitely want to keep
130:24 - it as a very very friendly place where
130:27 - the criticism is gentle and
130:30 - you know everybody tries to get along
130:32 - not in like a false peace kind of
130:34 - getting along like I'm definitely fine
130:36 - with heated debates and things but I
130:39 - just I'm not fine with people being mean
130:41 - or rude so let's so let's all try to
130:45 - keep it that way and keep it really open
130:47 - and I think that'll be the best for
130:52 - people who maybe are a little bit
130:53 - nervous about speaking out and and
130:57 - asking questions or things so yeah so if
131:01 - you watch an hour if you hear this
131:03 - recording and you want a place to go
131:05 - you're a little bit nervous you know
131:06 - check out that you know that channel on
131:09 - freenode and you know you'll get you get
131:14 - some some advice I you know I don't know
131:16 - there's a lot of people in this chat now
131:18 - they don't know what they're talking
131:20 - about and I I know what I'm talking
131:22 - about at least some of the time and so
131:25 - I'll do my best to help out and I'm sure
131:27 - they will too so awesome so I think this
131:31 - was a really productive video I'm going
131:33 - to wrap it up now because well we
131:36 - accomplished what we wanted to
131:37 - accomplish which was the load balancing
131:39 - with the ssl pass-through we also went
131:42 - over the wordpress api a little bit
131:45 - which was requested so hopefully you all
131:50 - got a little bit out of that and if you
131:52 - want to see more about any of that stuff
131:54 - let me know we also got a lot of good
131:58 - advice on finding jobs and kind of
131:59 - getting through that and now we have a
132:02 - free node channel where we can chat even
132:06 - outside the live chat so this is
132:07 - probably you know with a really really
132:11 - productive live chat sorry about the
132:14 - poor quality and if you're watching this
132:16 - video later on i'm sure it's not going
132:18 - to be a great quality either probably
132:20 - only like 480p replay quality so sorry
132:26 - about that they're not all that quality
132:27 - most of the other ones or are at least
132:29 - 1080p so I will be back on Monday at 2
132:35 - p.m. I like vaguely remember that I
132:38 - might have a meeting on Monday I do
132:39 - have it on my calendar but I'll have to
132:41 - check my email so if I have a meeting
132:43 - during that 2:00 p.m. time period I will
132:45 - make sure that I reschedule for a
132:47 - different time that same day and I will
132:50 - post that on Twitter to follow me on
132:54 - Twitter if if you want to get that
132:55 - update it will also be like they'll be
132:59 - an update on the free code camp channel
133:01 - so I think it will like pop up if you
133:03 - have notifications enabled in your
133:06 - browser or like on your phone so I so
133:17 - hopefully I don't have a meeting and I
133:18 - can do it as normal time but otherwise
