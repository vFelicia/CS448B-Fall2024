00:10 - hey everybody
00:12 - sorry about that i didn't realize the
00:14 - stream has started uh and also sorry
00:17 - it's a few minutes late i was trying to
00:20 - um
00:21 - adjust some settings i don't know if you
00:23 - remember last week we had some trouble
00:25 - with the video uh kind of stopping and
00:28 - things
00:29 - and i realized that
00:33 - i used to have a wired connection
00:36 - that was obviously a lot faster than the
00:40 - uh the wi-fi
00:41 - and i had we were troubleshooting why i
00:44 - couldn't get into the database that
00:45 - we've been working with
00:48 - they had me unplug it
00:50 - and then somehow that allowed me to
00:53 - to get in
00:55 - and then i never plugged it back in so
00:58 - when i stream i'm gonna try to keep it
00:59 - plugged in and i'll try to do transfers
01:02 - from the database when i'm not streaming
01:04 - uh if if that causes me not to be able
01:06 - to get in
01:08 - so hopefully the stream goes well
01:11 - if if you are having any trouble
01:13 - watching it
01:15 - uh let me know and then i'll adjust the
01:18 - settings some more
01:19 - today's gonna be a short stream
01:21 - i have my first intern
01:24 - is starting today and they're gonna come
01:26 - in and i'm gonna try to help him out you
01:28 - know get him set up
01:30 - and just kind of walk them through
01:33 - um
01:34 - you know what
01:35 - how how we do things
01:37 - you know walking through get you know
01:40 - github how to submit pull requests and
01:41 - things like that
01:43 - uh it looks like
01:44 - you're getting audio only
01:47 - all right let me switch to my other
01:48 - screen get video issues too buffering
01:50 - only
01:52 - hmm
01:55 - so it looks like
01:58 - there may still be problems i switched
02:00 - to a
02:01 - different
02:02 - view
02:03 - i don't know why that would work but
02:05 - last time i think some of you said that
02:07 - it helped when i did that
02:12 - if that doesn't help i'll stop the
02:14 - stream and restart it because i think i
02:16 - think that helped last time
02:24 - all right uh so i guess the audio is
02:26 - fine so i'm gonna s
02:28 - still buffering huh
02:38 - that's weird the network is just not as
02:41 - good as it was
02:42 - i don't know what happened with the
02:43 - network here but
02:48 - i used to be able to run on these
02:50 - settings easily
02:58 - all right so
03:00 - since you all can hear me
03:02 - at least let me walk you through what
03:05 - we're going to do because the first part
03:07 - i was just going to explain it anyway
03:09 - so that's fine let me
03:13 - let's see live latency 75 seconds
03:17 - all right
03:23 - all right let me
03:24 - stop the stream quickly so i can set
03:27 - turn the settings down a bit
03:31 - and then
03:34 - that might help
04:01 - all right let me know
04:03 - if it's any better now or if it's still
04:06 - bad i did turn the settings down a bit
04:08 - and i shut down
04:11 - a lot of programs
04:13 - let's see
04:14 - all right right now it's saying i'm not
04:16 - dropping frames
04:19 - all right
04:20 - cool i also shut down
04:23 - i was running the slack desktop app uh
04:27 - the sql studio
04:29 - um
04:30 - app and uh the microsoft office
04:34 - or the um
04:35 - microsoft outlook
04:37 - app as well
04:39 - so i don't know maybe those could be
04:41 - draining things i i know i've always
04:43 - heard that electron apps are resource
04:45 - intensive so
04:47 - you know two of those three i i know are
04:49 - electron apps i don't think the um
04:54 - the outlook app is but and we're also
04:57 - running
04:59 - a couple of windows of visual studio
05:00 - code which i'm not going to shut down
05:02 - because we're going to use it so
05:04 - that's it oh and i have spotify running
05:06 - so
05:08 - that could be it
05:17 - uh so so the webcam is still dropping
05:20 - frames
05:22 - but it but it is better
05:25 - uh
05:27 - i'm really gonna have to mess with the
05:28 - settings at some point but
05:32 - as as long as you can see the code
05:37 - let me let me get some code up here
05:41 - so let me know
05:43 - if this is readable
05:58 - all right
06:00 - so i'm waiting for a response let me see
06:01 - there i know there was a question up
06:03 - here
06:05 - uh blake asks
06:06 - if he should go with
06:09 - uh something like shopify or woocommerce
06:12 - wordpress
06:14 - um
06:15 - i've never used shopify uh so i can't i
06:18 - can't really comment on it i just know
06:20 - that
06:21 - i hear about it a lot it seems pretty
06:24 - popular
06:25 - uh i'd say for woocommerce if you don't
06:27 - plan on having a lot of traffic to your
06:30 - site woocommerce would be fine it's
06:32 - pretty easy to use but i have seen sites
06:36 - that
06:37 - when they get a ton of traffic
06:39 - woocommerce seems to run really slow and
06:41 - take up a lot of resources
06:44 - so that's something to keep in mind but
06:47 - as i said i think that's only really a
06:49 - problem if you're gonna have a lot of
06:51 - traffic at once and um i just saw a site
06:54 - like that and they would run sales and
06:56 - things and whenever that happened their
06:58 - site was
06:59 - really really slow
07:10 - all right
07:11 - harsha's saying it's kind of unwatchable
07:15 - all right let me
07:19 - see what else i can shut down
07:22 - the code is readable
07:24 - all right
07:25 - it seems the code is readable
07:27 - i'm gonna shut down more stuff
07:33 - let's turn off
07:35 - everything
07:48 - um
07:50 - actually i'm going to turn off ang rock
07:52 - as well
07:55 - let's turn off
07:57 - some posters we're not going to use this
08:00 - today
08:04 - make sure
08:18 - we'll need that
08:25 - all right so it looks like um
08:28 - you all can see
08:29 - the words which is fine you don't really
08:31 - need to see my face
08:34 - anyway
08:36 - um
08:39 - so as long as as long as you can hear me
08:41 - and you can see what i'm doing
08:44 - then this should work
08:46 - and i will work more on getting this to
08:49 - work uh like i said
08:53 - i'm i don't know i don't know what's up
08:54 - with the internet
08:56 - um
08:57 - so anyway hey everybody that's saying hi
08:59 - on the live chat sorry for the the
09:01 - weirdness uh
09:02 - again on the quality
09:06 - um let's see
09:10 - oh hey um
09:12 - viniqua norwood is here i think i said
09:15 - your name wrong last time so i think i
09:17 - said verneek and i'm pretty sure you
09:20 - told me at the november conference it
09:22 - was for neuqua let me know which way is
09:25 - the right way to say it because i felt
09:26 - really bad i didn't remember until after
09:28 - the stream that
09:29 - um
09:31 - i'm pretty sure i did the same thing
09:32 - when i met you
09:34 - and uh
09:35 - and then i forgot again
09:48 - all right harsh it says streams at 720p
09:51 - um
09:53 - not 1080. harsha says changing coding
09:55 - settings
09:57 - um
10:01 - yeah
10:02 - i can try to mess with the settings more
10:11 - it just is so weird that the the
10:13 - settings that have been working for
10:16 - i don't know the last eight months is
10:18 - not
10:19 - all of a sudden do not work anymore
10:34 - all right let's see
10:39 - let's see
10:56 - all right is it better when i don't have
10:59 - the video there
11:26 - all right
11:29 - all right let me try to
11:31 - let me try to work
11:35 - um
11:38 - all right so here's the problem
11:41 - that we need to fix so we need to do it
11:43 - in like
11:45 - less than 40 minutes
11:49 - i mean we don't have to but i'd like to
11:50 - in the stream
11:51 - so
11:52 - i have
11:55 - is this it
11:57 - yeah
11:59 - uh so right now we have some routing set
12:02 - up so we have our default routing
12:03 - through next js which
12:14 - all right
12:15 - the stream status is good right now
12:18 - i changed the output
12:25 - so
12:26 - let me know hopefully this is good now
12:29 - i definitely don't want to drop down to
12:31 - 720p all the time but
12:34 - uh
12:35 - 10 i'd rather have 1080
12:39 - for now it's okay
12:41 - let me know
12:44 - um
12:45 - leonard says your boss needs to sort out
12:47 - his priorities it's definitely not up to
12:49 - my boss what um
12:52 - what my internet i have it's
12:56 - it's definitely uh
12:57 - another department and higher up than
12:59 - that
13:02 - all right cool so it's better
13:04 - now i don't know maybe
13:07 - maybe something was done to the internet
13:09 - that i'm not aware of and i won't be
13:11 - able to stream
13:12 - at the same quality as before
13:18 - i don't know we'll see i hope that's not
13:19 - the case
13:21 - but
13:22 - i mean 720p i guess is is doable
13:27 - all right
13:30 - so it looks like the stream status is
13:31 - staying good at least from that's what
13:33 - youtube is telling me
13:36 - okay
13:38 - all right
13:39 - let's let's do this now
13:41 - but uh really really sorry that uh we've
13:45 - taken up this much time on technical
13:47 - difficulties
13:50 - um
13:51 - okay
13:53 - so here's what i want to do in order to
13:55 - keep the urls the same
13:57 - uh what i need to do is
14:00 - instead of like a uh top level your like
14:03 - for instance
14:05 - if we were to type in
14:09 - right now the way this is set up if i
14:11 - were to type in something like
14:13 - franciscan dot university slash about
14:16 - it would route
14:18 - to a page named about here
14:21 - it would render that page
14:24 - but what i wanted to do
14:27 - if someone were to type in slash about
14:32 - i wanted to
14:34 - send all the traffic for that
14:37 - to a one component
14:41 - but
14:42 - that's not what it's the only thing
14:44 - that's going to happen i want multiple
14:46 - routes to be sent to that one component
14:50 - and i want to pass in some data just
14:52 - like we're doing here and that's going
14:54 - to determine what data gets rendered
14:57 - there so you see it's
15:02 - these are no longer going to be like
15:04 - single pages
15:08 - so we're basically kind of like
15:10 - overriding the default behavior for uh
15:13 - for next
15:15 - but
15:16 - i don't really see another way i
15:18 - discussed some of these in the latest
15:20 - issue in this repository if you want to
15:22 - read more about why and what i'm trying
15:24 - to do you can check that out
15:26 - uh the possible solution i gave there i
15:28 - don't think is the best i
15:30 - thought about it more and
15:33 - i i think the one that i've come up with
15:35 - now is better so you can see some of my
15:37 - idea here
15:39 - in my comments i'm gonna route each page
15:41 - individually to one component
15:44 - like majors and then pass in the correct
15:46 - slug manually as the id and then we're
15:49 - also gonna have a proper route so we're
15:50 - gonna have one route that matches the
15:52 - old routing system
15:54 - which i don't think is is organized
15:57 - properly
15:58 - then we're going to have the new routes
16:00 - what's that that is going to end up
16:02 - having two different pages with the same
16:03 - content which is not great for seo but
16:06 - we got to do it because we want
16:09 - a more reasonable routing structure url
16:12 - structure but then we also don't want to
16:14 - break links
16:15 - uh so
16:17 - i'll take my chances with the seo
16:20 - so here's what we're going to do
16:22 - and this is very much gonna be like a
16:24 - test
16:25 - of whether or not this even works
16:28 - so i've thought about it
16:30 - it should work but i haven't tried it
16:32 - yet
16:35 - okay so let's do this down here
16:39 - we um
16:42 - let's see we pasted
16:50 - yeah let's put that there
16:58 - let's see
17:02 - here we go
17:03 - all right so we're going to work first
17:05 - with majors
17:09 - um
17:12 - no no it's not there so let's work
17:16 - with theo i know theology is a uh
17:20 - right now
17:22 - there's a theology is like a
17:25 - um
17:27 - i'm gonna say like a top
17:29 - level
17:30 - um
17:31 - in in the hierarchy of our urls
17:35 - and let's route this to the component
17:38 - called major
17:41 - so what i want to happen is
17:44 - let's see id is
17:50 - theology
17:52 - as a string
17:54 - there we are so what i want to happen
17:56 - then is to have several of these
18:02 - and
18:03 - let's go
18:03 - [Music]
18:06 - nursing
18:09 - and this will also be
18:11 - nursing alright so
18:13 - this might be a little bit easier to
18:14 - understand
18:16 - so we're going to have to manually put
18:18 - in
18:19 - these
18:22 - and then
18:24 - pass in what we want to major
18:28 - that's more work than i wanted to do
18:32 - uh but the alternative would be
18:35 - and this is the alternative that i had
18:37 - in
18:38 - uh the issue uh that i opened
18:42 - the alternative i was thinking would be
18:45 - that
18:45 - everything
18:49 - we basically put an id right here
18:52 - and then pass in whatever that string is
18:56 - here
18:58 - and the the problem is then we won't be
19:00 - we can't use custom post types for
19:02 - everything everything in wordpress would
19:04 - have to be a page or let's say a blog
19:06 - post i'd probably do it as a page
19:08 - because it would make more sense to
19:09 - people
19:11 - um but then you'd have a bunch of
19:13 - different stuff in there together so
19:14 - like all your majors would be in there
19:16 - but then you'd have like your privacy
19:18 - policy in there and
19:20 - you know everything that's that top
19:22 - level in the hierarchy of the url would
19:24 - all have to be in there so it would be a
19:27 - mess
19:29 - to
19:31 - to keep up to date
19:33 - so i think i'd rather have a bit of a
19:35 - mess here in the code and that way i
19:37 - only have to deal with it
19:39 - and then the people who are going to
19:42 - edit things in wordpress
19:44 - will have things
19:46 - looking a lot more neat and organized
19:50 - it mean it makes sense for me to be able
19:52 - to do this is going to be a pain now but
19:54 - it's not going to be that much of a pain
19:56 - later because these aren't going to
19:57 - change like ever
20:02 - but we'll have you know students uh
20:05 - student workers editing these things and
20:09 - you know people that don't have
20:11 - necessarily that much uh experience
20:14 - so
20:16 - it'd be easier if things were more
20:17 - straightforward for them
20:19 - so that's why i've decided to do it this
20:20 - way instead the other way it's going to
20:22 - make our file here
20:25 - a lot
20:26 - bigger
20:28 - but
20:30 - i just i don't really see any way around
20:32 - that right now
20:35 - all right so let's give this a test here
20:39 - so let's see theology
20:41 - and nursing so we already have this data
20:44 - in
20:47 - yeah i think we have this data and i'll
20:49 - have to check on the slugs and make sure
20:50 - we have the proper slugs but we should
20:52 - be able to pull some of this in
20:54 - so let's go into our
20:57 - oh let's bring this back
20:59 - and let's make a component now
21:02 - called major
21:12 - file
21:16 - all right so we make this component
21:17 - called major and i did a test component
21:21 - a little while ago i think i can just
21:23 - copy this
21:25 - and paste it in a major and it should
21:26 - work for what we want to do now
21:30 - we
21:31 - we're going to need a new query yeah
21:33 - we're going to need a new query as well
21:38 - but this should work query id
21:48 - all right so this was just showing the
21:51 - id that's getting passed in so i want
21:55 - more than that i think
21:58 - what i'll need is what are we doing for
22:00 - news here
22:04 - yeah we'll want something like this
22:17 - all right
22:20 - so it's not going to be news it's going
22:22 - to be
22:24 - major and
22:27 - we're gonna have to change this query so
22:29 - this would be
22:31 - major query
22:32 - query
22:35 - major
22:38 - major query
22:41 - why
22:42 - all right
22:43 - um
22:46 - i used to find it never used
22:50 - all right well let's get rid of it
22:55 - all right so we have this query
22:58 - and let's change it here
23:05 - major
23:06 - all right so now let's go to
23:09 - where we have our queries
23:12 - let's make one called major
23:17 - so i'm trying to go more quickly than i
23:19 - usually do because this
23:20 - it has to be a short stream
23:22 - um i will get back to the live chat and
23:24 - answer some questions before the stream
23:26 - is over
23:27 - uh i just want to get something i want
23:30 - to at least do one test of this
23:32 - uh before the stream's over
23:36 - did we make ours called major i thought
23:38 - i did oh well
23:40 - uh new file
23:44 - okay um let's try
23:48 - nope not that one
23:54 - um
23:59 - i do need that one and
24:02 - news
24:03 - yeah so basically need the same thing as
24:05 - the news query
24:07 - um but we're gonna put it in
24:09 - major
24:11 - and
24:12 - we'll name this
24:22 - major query
24:27 - i'm gonna double check directory all
24:30 - right maybe maybe we need this to be
24:35 - plural
24:36 - majors where name okay
24:39 - id title slug content exit
24:44 - i don't think we're gonna have an
24:45 - excerpt for this
24:47 - i don't think we brought it in
24:50 - and i don't care about the date
24:52 - i need to just okay
24:55 - that's this is i think all we care about
24:57 - right now
24:58 - all right so we have our query ready we
25:01 - have our
25:03 - page ready
25:04 - our our component
25:08 - uh i don't care about console logging
25:10 - this
25:14 - and
25:14 - let's see
25:17 - and we're bringing the right thing in
25:19 - here
25:23 - all right
25:24 - uh let's see
25:29 - see if we can get this to work oh i know
25:31 - we need to check our um
25:34 - our slugs to see if they match up in
25:37 - wordpress
25:40 - so i have wordpress open here i need to
25:42 - log in again but we should be able to
25:45 - check
25:46 - so
25:49 - uh i guess i'll search
25:52 - oh i didn't bring theology in
25:55 - what did i bring in
26:00 - business program texts
26:12 - all right
26:13 - we'll just have to change what we're
26:16 - sending in
26:17 - business
26:20 - all right did this come in as maybe as
26:22 - business things
26:32 - so i guess this came in differently than
26:34 - i expected
26:39 - let's see if this one is
26:41 - more what i'm expecting
26:52 - i don't think so
27:18 - all right
27:19 - let's change our slugs in
27:29 - oops
27:31 - uh let's get
27:32 - this sorry miss clicking
27:35 - let's go to our screen options
27:41 - and
27:44 - slug
27:45 - so i can see
27:46 - it and i just wanted to say economics
27:53 - and we probably should double check that
28:02 - i'll let that load because it's going to
28:04 - take a while
28:05 - um
28:07 - economics and
28:09 - let's change this one to
28:17 - accounting
28:23 - let's check this
28:25 - and
28:27 - let's go to undergraduate academics i
28:30 - think that's where we want to be
28:37 - all right we're okay on time not too bad
28:40 - and our major programs
28:46 - economics and
28:49 - accounting
28:51 - we should have yep okay so economics and
28:54 - accounting yep they they have
28:57 - the url structure that i expected them
29:00 - to have
29:02 - and
29:04 - good all right so we're trying to pull i
29:06 - suppose this content
29:09 - i'm not worried about this content
29:12 - uh it's basically just this that i i
29:14 - want to pull right for right now
29:17 - and i'll have to decide with my boss how
29:20 - much of this we want to keep
29:23 - or even what format we want to keep it
29:25 - in
29:27 - all right so now we have the right slugs
29:30 - i just need to change up the slugs in
29:32 - our code
29:34 - to match
29:36 - uh so let's go back to our server
29:38 - and we'll change
29:40 - theology to
29:44 - economics and we'll change nursing to
29:47 - accounting
29:52 - for those of you who really love
29:53 - alphabetical order sorry about that
29:56 - um
29:58 - all right so
30:00 - let's see if this works
30:04 - i wonder
30:07 - i don't know if i have to restart the
30:08 - server for this to work we'll find out
30:10 - in a second
30:12 - uh i'm on
30:14 - [Music]
30:15 - here we go localhost let's give it a
30:18 - refresh
30:19 - and let's try
30:27 - economics
30:30 - okay i might i'm gonna have to refresh
30:32 - this
30:36 - um
31:02 - i
31:03 - does anybody have the location stuff
31:06 - activated on facebook where it tells you
31:08 - when nearby people are around
31:11 - so
31:12 - some of my co-workers have it activated
31:15 - and it always tells me when i'm sitting
31:16 - in my office like say hi to this person
31:19 - they're nearby
31:20 - i'm always like of course they're nearby
31:22 - they work in the same office as me
31:25 - uh i guess i should turn it off comedy
31:26 - property edge is undefined
31:41 - all right so it looks like
31:47 - we weren't getting the data
31:49 - that we wanted
32:05 - all right let's check out what we did
32:08 - um
32:10 - am i passing the right thing
32:12 - yeah i'm passing economics i'm passing
32:15 - accounting
32:16 - um
32:20 - all right and then within our component
32:23 - yeah we're trying we're grabbing the id
32:25 - it should return the id so our id should
32:28 - be in props
32:33 - and then we're passing this id
32:36 - to our query
32:44 - oops
32:46 - i forgot to change the name of this
32:48 - component
32:50 - major
32:53 - major
32:56 - oh so simple
32:58 - it's easy to forget
33:01 - let's see
33:04 - i guess it didn't matter much
33:13 - yeah it didn't even matter at all right
33:15 - because it was still going here
33:17 - um
33:20 - let's see
33:21 - i see there's some uh questions in the
33:24 - live chat i will get to the live chat
33:25 - soon
33:34 - okay veronique thank you for um
33:37 - correcting me
33:39 - i don't know why i thought it was
33:42 - it was different
33:44 - anyway
33:46 - i just i'm glad that i got it right and
33:49 - uh thanks
33:50 - thanks again
33:53 - anyway thanks for watching too uh i hope
33:55 - everything's going well with you
34:02 - all right did i date a major edges maybe
34:06 - it's majors let's try that out
34:16 - yeah that was it i just needed to put
34:18 - majors
34:19 - yay
34:20 - all right cool so we have our economics
34:22 - courses
34:23 - and then
34:24 - we'll have
34:26 - what are we gonna have here um
34:30 - accounting
34:33 - accounting
34:35 - great we have accounting now let's try
34:37 - to go to a page that we have with our
34:39 - next router uh the way i've done this
34:42 - it should work
34:45 - our next router should still work for
34:48 - anything we've set up as its own page so
34:52 - this test graphql page
34:55 - should work
34:57 - still
35:07 - okay cool
35:09 - um
35:10 - i'm assuming that's what we
35:11 - [Music]
35:12 - wanted to do here
35:16 - yeah we did we hard-coded that in great
35:18 - all right so
35:21 - so far this is working well
35:23 - not an ideal situation because i'm gonna
35:25 - have to put a lot of these in the only
35:27 - other thing that i wanted to do is
35:30 - to do something like this and we can
35:31 - test this out very easily
35:34 - is
35:39 - i want to say if we have
35:41 - major
35:42 - economics
35:44 - i wanted to do the same thing basically
35:47 - so let's save that
35:49 - and
35:53 - restart this
35:57 - and then
36:05 - economics
36:10 - awesome and that works as well
36:12 - uh let's just verify that the
36:15 - the first way works too
36:17 - cool i was actually uh i i majored
36:22 - well actually the school i went to you
36:23 - couldn't major in economics you it was
36:25 - like a triple
36:26 - thing all put together but economics is
36:29 - one of the things i studied
36:32 - all right cool so
36:34 - hopefully you can see how some of that
36:36 - worked
36:37 - now we will be able to keep the old urls
36:41 - working
36:42 - but still have our new url structure so
36:44 - the url structure that has like major
36:47 - and then economics
36:49 - that one is going to be what we use for
36:51 - all the navigation in the site
36:54 - and then
36:56 - for
36:59 - any old links
37:02 - this will still work
37:04 - uh
37:05 - i
37:06 - think i don't know it's it's a way that
37:09 - works i can just move forward and just
37:11 - grind out
37:12 - all this you know just play some music
37:15 - and just
37:16 - start copying and pasting and changing
37:18 - things and i should be able to get it
37:20 - all finished you know in an hour or less
37:23 - um
37:25 - yeah i think it can work um
37:28 - i need your id
37:36 - oh yeah har thank you uh we could
37:38 - just put in um the major
37:41 - id
37:43 - so yeah let me do that now that's yeah
37:45 - that's actually um
37:48 - a lot better
37:50 - so just like we're doing up here with
37:52 - the news id instead of passing in
37:54 - economics manually we're going to pass
37:56 - in
37:59 - um
38:00 - these params from here and let's save
38:03 - that
38:04 - and test it
38:08 - actually let's test that with accounting
38:10 - right now
38:19 - all right
38:21 - i just wanted to verify that i do in
38:23 - fact have to stop and start the server
38:26 - when i do that
38:33 - david says remind yourself jesse
38:35 - overconfidence is a slow and insidious
38:38 - killer
38:40 - i think
38:41 - david did you say the same thing in the
38:43 - last stream i do think it was the last
38:45 - stream i mean it's good advice
38:48 - um
38:49 - all right awesome
38:53 - so it does work
38:54 - excellent
38:59 - and
39:03 - economics yay
39:05 - all right great
39:10 - wow
39:11 - can't believe i got that
39:14 - uh harsh also says might remove that
39:15 - extra heading in the component yeah yeah
39:17 - we'll remove that uh too
39:20 - that was just for some testing i was the
39:21 - one earlier
39:24 - um so we won't we won't have uh this
39:27 - heading this was just to verify
39:31 - i don't even remember because i was
39:33 - obviously wasn't testing this component
39:34 - i pasted it over from a different one so
39:37 - i was testing something
39:39 - and i left it in there because it was a
39:40 - component that was never gonna
39:42 - be used i was just gonna delete the
39:44 - whole thing
39:45 - um
39:47 - all right so let me now go to the chat
39:50 - i'm gonna answer as many questions as i
39:52 - can before
39:53 - my
39:54 - new intern shows up
39:56 - and
39:58 - so it uh if the intern shows up and i'm
40:01 - not done yet then i might not get to all
40:03 - the questions but i'll do my best
40:13 - so
40:27 - uh three one says when tech experts have
40:29 - problems it makes me feel better it
40:31 - makes me feel good that
40:33 - that that implies that i'm a tech expert
40:37 - which i really don't
40:39 - consider myself a tech expert
40:43 - but
40:46 - uh it still feels good to
40:49 - have that implied
40:52 - all right
41:13 - john hanson says famous words have been
41:16 - spoken this should work
41:20 - sometimes when i say this should work it
41:22 - doesn't work but in our case it actually
41:24 - worked exactly like
41:27 - i i thought it was gonna work so
41:31 - does not happen all the time but it
41:33 - happened today
41:35 - which is great because we didn't have
41:37 - that much time for troubleshooting
41:39 - uh rook asked if there was a stream
41:41 - yesterday there was not a stream
41:42 - yesterday uh i was i did a little bit of
41:45 - work from home yesterday um i wasn't
41:48 - feeling well over the weekend i'm not
41:50 - sure if i had food poisoning or the flu
41:52 - uh just in case it was the flu i didn't
41:55 - want to
41:56 - come in here and get everybody sick so i
41:58 - thought i better
41:59 - uh just do some work from ho
42:05 - let's see
42:18 - i heard harshad said can't believe that
42:20 - data is well formatted the old style
42:22 - sheet is working fine in here too
42:24 - um
42:25 - yeah can you
42:27 - i
42:29 - it's amazing i mean this this formatting
42:32 - is
42:33 - really good
42:35 - um
42:36 - like now i mean this is compare if you
42:38 - hadn't seen some of the stuff we brought
42:39 - in earlier it might not look really good
42:41 - to you right now but
42:43 - for sure compared to the other data that
42:46 - we brought in
42:47 - this this looks great
42:50 - uh which is good these this i think is
42:52 - one of the things that we're going to be
42:53 - able to just
42:55 - bring it all in
42:56 - and just let it go as is
42:59 - at first and this will be
43:03 - adequate
43:05 - and then we can add on to it
43:08 - as
43:09 - if we get everything else finished or
43:11 - even after we launched as we had have
43:13 - time
43:15 - yeah so that's going to be the idea for
43:16 - every page except for the home page the
43:19 - home page we're going to put is
43:21 - you know a lot more effort into
43:24 - because you know way more people are
43:26 - gonna see the home page
43:28 - uh than any interior page
43:31 - uh so we want that to look nice
43:33 - and if you go into an interior page you
43:35 - want info so as long as we have the
43:37 - information there
43:39 - i'm okay with that we can always add
43:40 - something that looks nice a little bit
43:42 - nicer later on
43:45 - um
43:47 - rowler
43:49 - rauler
43:51 - says
43:53 - i just got here what are you making all
43:55 - right so uh just a quick recap
43:57 - um i was using next js with react next
44:01 - comes with a built-in router but i
44:03 - needed to do some things with the url
44:05 - structure
44:07 - uh because we're migrating from an old
44:09 - site and need to keep the old links
44:11 - working
44:12 - i needed to do some things that next
44:14 - doesn't do by default
44:16 - but we already kind of had some we had
44:18 - some custom parameterized routing setup
44:20 - anyway
44:21 - so we just kind of extended that
44:24 - and was able to
44:27 - uh we were able to keep the old urls
44:30 - route them to where we needed
44:32 - and so that's pretty much it it didn't
44:34 - it didn't even take us
44:36 - that long now i did give it some some
44:39 - thought beforehand and
44:40 - as to how i would do it
44:42 - um but
44:44 - it all worked out
44:47 - john hanson says
44:49 - is it possible to pull the ids needed
44:51 - for the page routes
44:52 - so you need to only write one function
44:58 - i i've been thinking about that
45:01 - so here's what i
45:09 - all right here's what i thought
45:12 - and i think i explained this a little
45:14 - bit before but i didn't really do a
45:15 - great job
45:16 - um so
45:20 - let's say i just did
45:23 - this
45:28 - and had
45:33 - let's say
45:34 - id
45:36 - what would happen then i mean it assume
45:39 - i have the right stuff here as well but
45:41 - what would happen then is
45:44 - this would make the uh the next routing
45:48 - it would override everything none of the
45:50 - routing and next would work
45:52 - so what i would need to do then
45:56 - is make sure that every page that needs
46:01 - every page
46:02 - that a user would go to that would have
46:04 - a url that would just be slash and then
46:07 - something and no slash after that
46:10 - would need to
46:13 - exist as the same post type in wordpress
46:17 - you can't currently search
46:21 - for a string
46:23 - in multiple post types at the same time
46:26 - with the wp graphql plugin
46:29 - there was an issue open about it it's
46:31 - something that would be nice to have but
46:33 - right now
46:35 - it's something that would take a lot of
46:36 - work
46:39 - so
46:40 - instead of
46:41 - trying to do php which i'm not great
46:43 - with and somehow
46:46 - um make that happen with the plug-in
46:48 - we're using
46:51 - this is easier
46:54 - it's gonna be
46:57 - let's say uglier when you read the code
47:00 - but it's definitely going to be an
47:01 - easier solution a faster solution
47:03 - ideally what i would like to be able to
47:06 - do is do this
47:08 - and then search but as i said before
47:10 - that is going to make things messy in
47:12 - the admin panel uh for wordpress
47:15 - so i brought in
47:20 - you know so right now we have things
47:21 - separated out in a post type so we would
47:23 - end up have having is a lot of stuff
47:27 - in here as like pages
47:30 - and
47:31 - it would query whatever the string is
47:33 - that gets passed into the as the id from
47:35 - the url
47:37 - it would query that
47:39 - and it would look in all the pages for
47:41 - that
47:42 - slug
47:43 - so we would just have a lot of different
47:46 - pages
47:47 - and i don't even know how many pages use
47:49 - this but i'm i'm pretty sure uh like the
47:52 - privacy policy so all the majors have it
47:56 - the um contact us privacy for policy
48:00 - uh directions non-discrimination i don't
48:03 - know this is consumer information see
48:06 - it's not even
48:07 - consistent
48:09 - so we have consumer information has it
48:11 - but then also we have
48:14 - um
48:16 - page within consumer information so
48:19 - basically what would happen you know
48:20 - this site's been added on to over the
48:22 - years so
48:25 - we just have a lot of variety
48:28 - so i think this way is going to still
48:30 - let us keep the custom post types as
48:32 - much as possible
48:34 - but still give us a way to
48:38 - kind of manipulate the urls a bit when
48:40 - we need to
48:42 - pretty easily so anyway all right john
48:44 - john said i get it you got to do what
48:46 - you got to do yeah this is definitely
48:48 - one of those you gotta do what you gotta
48:49 - do situations here i met with my boss
48:52 - last week and he was he said no we gotta
48:55 - keep those urls
48:57 - and i just said
48:59 - okay i'll figure it out
49:02 - so
49:03 - uh i didn't work
49:05 - i didn't really work this weekend but i
49:07 - was thinking about it all weekend
49:12 - so i guess
49:13 - i've come up with a solution
49:16 - i i just it's a trade-off i came up with
49:19 - several solutions and they all involve
49:22 - trade-offs
49:24 - this one seems like it will work out
49:29 - the best considering everybody that's
49:31 - gonna be working on the project and what
49:32 - our needs are
49:35 - all right
49:36 - so
49:37 - i think i got through all the comments
49:39 - questions
49:40 - uh so i'm right on time here
49:45 - and
49:47 - yeah so i will be back tomorrow
49:51 - uh i guess
49:52 - maybe
49:53 - i'll probably be back around 1
49:56 - i don't know if 12 is a better better
49:58 - time maybe i'll try to do 12.
50:01 - uh
50:03 - 12 is normally like my lunch break but i
50:04 - could always take a lunch break like
50:06 - earlier or later not a big deal to me
50:12 - um but i will be back and uh hopefully
50:14 - i'll have any issues sorted out with
50:17 - uh my streaming so we don't have
50:21 - you know the craziness that we had today
50:24 - uh let's see
50:27 - if anybody
50:30 - if anybody's really knowledgeable about
50:32 - obs which i'm using for streaming uh and
50:34 - you have or if you know of any articles
50:36 - or anything that could help out without
50:38 - with that let me know
50:40 - um
50:42 - i'm gonna try to look up some stuff
50:46 - test out some different things
50:49 - okay
50:50 - all right it looks like 12 is is a good
50:53 - time for some of you are saying that in
50:55 - the live chat
50:57 - okay all right maybe i'll try for 12
51:00 - then
51:02 - yeah you know there's there's actually
51:04 - way less of um
51:07 - a chance of me having a meeting at 12
51:09 - since it's normally everybody's lunch
51:11 - hour so maybe it's not
51:14 - such a bad time
51:17 - okay
51:18 - well i'm going to wrap things up here
51:19 - thank you so much for your patience with
51:21 - all the technical difficulties we had at
51:23 - the beginning of the stream and uh thank
51:25 - you for your your help as well in the
51:27 - live chat
51:29 - and uh it's just it's really cool
51:31 - everybody being here especially all of
51:33 - you that stuck through all that stuff at
51:35 - the beginning it was like almost half
51:37 - the stream i think was just taken up
51:39 - with
51:40 - you know trying to get the
51:41 - stream working properly
51:44 - um
