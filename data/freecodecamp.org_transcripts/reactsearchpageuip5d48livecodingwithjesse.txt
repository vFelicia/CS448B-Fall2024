00:05 - hey everyone welcome to live coding with
00:07 - jesse i'm jesse
00:09 - and today
00:10 - we're gonna
00:11 - do some ui work so we're gonna try to
00:15 - stay as close as we can within material
00:18 - design principles
00:21 - and
00:24 - uh we're working on this search page so
00:27 - i've been looking at
00:29 - probably what's the most well-known
00:32 - search page with lots of filters
00:35 - and that is
00:36 - amazon search
00:38 - a well-known search in general probably
00:40 - be google's search page
00:43 - but i think for our use case we're going
00:46 - to have filters that are closer to what
00:48 - amazon uses so
00:50 - we can take some
00:52 - inspiration from google search page as
00:54 - well
00:56 - but
00:57 - at least for the desktop version
01:01 - i think we're going to be better off
01:02 - going with something similar to what
01:04 - amazon uses
01:07 - uh even even the mobile as well
01:09 - i think the way amazon has done it is
01:13 - pretty nice
01:18 - so
01:19 - on my other screen i'm trying to get
01:21 - these examples up of
01:26 - what
01:27 - what both amazon and google do
01:30 - for their search uh filters and
01:35 - sorting
01:43 - uh for some reason it's not let me
01:45 - resize this window here we go
01:51 - hmm
02:01 - okay
02:03 - let me
02:10 - let me get ngrok started
02:12 - for you all so if you're not familiar
02:14 - with ngrok
02:16 - this is going to allow
02:18 - all of you
02:19 - to use this link to see the website
02:22 - that's being hosted locally you can
02:24 - inspect it
02:26 - in your own dev tools you know on your
02:29 - own machine as we're going so that's in
02:31 - the live chat i'll probably paste it
02:32 - again in a few minutes as more people
02:34 - join
02:35 - looks like we have
02:36 - yeah we have about our average uh number
02:38 - of viewers in here now so
02:41 - i'm going to switch my screen and get
02:43 - started
02:48 - uh i do want to let you all know
02:51 - especially those of you who watch my
02:52 - last stream uh that i tried to do at
02:55 - home and the quality wasn't too great
02:57 - that i did upgrade my internet service
02:59 - to the highest level i could possibly
03:01 - get at my my house and
03:05 - i'm hoping that'll help and i also
03:07 - messed around with a lot of the settings
03:09 - i looked at what a bunch of other people
03:10 - were doing
03:12 - i had some help
03:14 - um so you know like the youtube
03:16 - um
03:18 - live stream
03:19 - or the uh 24 7
03:22 - uh
03:23 - free code camp music stream that's going
03:26 - now so the guy who does that uh pretty
03:28 - matthew
03:30 - i think his name is matthew i hope i
03:32 - didn't get that wrong uh but matthew
03:34 - worked with me for like an hour we were
03:36 - trying to figure it out so
03:39 - i've done all that i think i can at this
03:41 - point to try to get it to work so
03:42 - hopefully the next time i try to do it
03:44 - from home
03:45 - which may be tomorrow or sometime next
03:47 - week it will work i'm aiming to get 720p
03:51 - resolution i think that'll be high
03:53 - enough so that everyone can see the font
03:56 - i don't really think it'd be possible
03:57 - for my current setup to get higher than
03:59 - 720p
04:02 - so
04:04 - i'm hopeful for that
04:06 - i really would would want to have a
04:08 - better quality for you all
04:12 - also
04:13 - i'm working on a project
04:15 - let's get this
04:17 - let's get our ui started
04:19 - uh should we do
04:22 - you know normally we do a mobile first
04:24 - one but i think i'd rather start off
04:27 - with a desktop
04:29 - search
04:31 - because the mobile first one is going to
04:33 - add the mobile version of our search is
04:35 - going to add a bit more complexity
04:38 - and
04:39 - i don't know that i want to deal with
04:41 - that right now i think it'd be better to
04:42 - go with the more simple one and then add
04:45 - the complexity of having drop downs and
04:47 - things
04:50 - so that's what we'll do
04:53 - so any i'm working on a new project if
04:56 - anyone is interested let me know i'll
04:58 - have a get up repo up soon
05:00 - but i i put some details on twitter
05:03 - yesterday or the day before or so
05:06 - and
05:08 - i bought
05:09 - a a brain computer interface headset so
05:12 - i don't know if you all have ever seen
05:13 - this but
05:14 - uh you put this headset on it's kind of
05:16 - like headphones uh and it it monitors
05:19 - your your brain activity your brain
05:21 - waves
05:23 - and um
05:25 - you can tell
05:27 - you know certain things about what's
05:28 - going on in the brain like
05:30 - are you more relaxed uh
05:32 - or you know are you more focused uh
05:35 - things like that
05:36 - so
05:39 - my son
05:40 - uh my oldest son who's eight years old
05:42 - he has obsessive-compulsive disorder or
05:44 - he has some issues where you know he'll
05:46 - just like get he gets himself all worked
05:48 - up about something and if it gets bad
05:50 - enough he just like he can't get out of
05:53 - this uh this mentality where he's just
05:55 - so frustrated and upset
05:57 - so my idea is that i'm going to take
05:59 - those brain waves
06:01 - and i'm going to use some of the work
06:03 - that alex castillo has been doing
06:06 - so uh you could check out alex on his
06:09 - alex castillo dot io uh check him out on
06:11 - twitter you know he's been at a bunch of
06:13 - conferences but he's done a lot of work
06:15 - with being able to interpret the signal
06:18 - from those uh headsets
06:20 - and
06:21 - and bring it in
06:23 - and manipulate use that for with
06:25 - javascript so basically pull it into a
06:27 - website or a web app
06:30 - so i'd like to do that same thing and
06:32 - alex has actually offered to help me
06:34 - with this which is awesome
06:37 - and i want to bring it into a very
06:38 - simple javascript game
06:41 - that's going to help my son
06:44 - recognize when his brain is starting to
06:46 - get into that pattern where it's he's
06:48 - gonna get all worked up
06:50 - to recognize that early enough so he can
06:52 - get himself out of that and also to help
06:54 - him train his brain to be able to get
06:56 - himself out of that to calm down so the
06:58 - idea is just very loose right now but
07:00 - the idea of the game is that certain
07:02 - mechanics in the game are going to be
07:04 - based on
07:06 - his his brain activity
07:08 - so
07:09 - in order to
07:11 - move forward in the game and progress
07:13 - he'll have to successfully calm himself
07:15 - down
07:17 - so there's going to be a lot of fine
07:18 - tuning that's going to happen i know
07:21 - there's definitely got to be a balance
07:23 - between like
07:25 - making the game um
07:28 - challenging enough so that it actually
07:30 - does give him incentive and train him to
07:33 - you know help correct his thought
07:34 - patterns
07:36 - but it also can't be too challenging
07:37 - that it actually would make him more
07:39 - frustrated
07:41 - so he does get really frustrated with
07:43 - video games if if he keeps like losing
07:45 - and losing so
07:46 - it's gonna probably take a long time but
07:48 - i think if it could work
07:50 - it could be really helpful for my son
07:52 - but potentially helpful for other people
07:54 - who are dealing with mental health
07:56 - issues
07:58 - especially with kids adults have a much
08:00 - easier time verbalizing what they're
08:03 - thinking
08:04 - but kids especially when my son was
08:06 - younger
08:07 - you just never knew what was going on in
08:08 - his head he didn't know how to explain
08:11 - what he was experiencing
08:13 - so i'm thinking that
08:15 - this may help
08:17 - so
08:18 - i'm going to start with start with my
08:20 - son
08:21 - and
08:22 - see how it goes so
08:25 - anyway
08:26 - i'll probably give you you know updates
08:28 - on this as it goes on you know i may
08:29 - even live stream some of the work on it
08:31 - record some of the results uh because i
08:34 - think
08:35 - i mean other people might be interested
08:37 - and you know other people that maybe are
08:38 - way more experienced than me might be
08:40 - interested and might be able to do more
08:41 - with the project and help more people so
08:44 - anyway
08:46 - enough with that project let's get to
08:47 - our project uh that that we're working
08:50 - on today
08:52 - and that is
08:56 - this search page so today what we're
08:59 - going to do is just take these filters
09:01 - that we have here
09:03 - and this sorting
09:04 - and we're just going to move it over
09:07 - we're gonna move it to the side so let's
09:08 - see what side
09:14 - left side or right side
09:21 - i don't really know i don't know whether
09:22 - we should do left or right
09:31 - if any as one has any opinion on that
09:33 - let me know otherwise i guess we'll just
09:34 - start on
09:38 - the right side
09:45 - yeah
09:48 - so essentially this this section here
09:50 - will be split into
09:53 - um
09:54 - let's say a fourth of it or a third of
09:56 - it will be filters and then the rest
09:58 - will be search results
10:04 - okay james saying right side
10:09 - okay we can try that
10:13 - all right so let's get this into
10:15 - position first we'll kind of
10:17 - fill out you know this basic grid that
10:19 - we'll have that'll keep these in their
10:21 - right sections
10:22 - and uh we could probably determine like
10:25 - at what point we need to switch to a
10:26 - mobile view
10:30 - and then
10:34 - then we'll go uh
10:36 - get like kind of a little bit more
10:37 - detailed with fixing padding and things
10:40 - like that
10:44 - sorry
10:45 - sorry about the on
10:49 - okay
10:52 - all right so uh some of you are
10:54 - commenting here on on this
10:56 - um
10:59 - michael says won't be able to stay till
11:00 - i see what you intend
11:02 - all right fair enough yeah it's i have
11:04 - an image in my head but of course you
11:06 - all can't see that so
11:08 - james asks a great question how many
11:10 - check boxes will there be eventually
11:13 - there may end up being quite a few
11:17 - yeah definitely more than three
11:19 - so let me let me pull over
11:23 - uh from amazon here
11:27 - let me pull this over under the screen
11:30 - so you all can see kind of what
11:32 - what they're doing and so so you can see
11:34 - what i have in my mind a bit
11:37 - so
11:38 - i just did a search for a webcam because
11:40 - i'm i'm looking for a better webcam for
11:43 - streaming
11:44 - but
11:47 - they have
11:50 - their refined by section here
11:55 - and you can click on these different
11:56 - things but they have them and we may end
11:59 - up having to do this as well to help the
12:02 - user
12:04 - they have them in these little
12:05 - subsections
12:07 - and
12:09 - depending on how many
12:11 - filtering options we end up having that
12:15 - that might be
12:16 - a better way to go so something similar
12:19 - to this
12:20 - and then amazon puts their sort by up
12:23 - here
12:26 - i mean that's a possibility
12:29 - if that's what you where a user would
12:30 - expect it to be and instead of with the
12:33 - filters then i'm open to that
12:39 - um
12:43 - and then the search bar
12:47 - i do kind of want to keep the search bar
12:49 - like maybe at the top so maybe something
12:52 - more like
12:53 - search bar where it is except with
12:55 - better padding and not completely across
12:57 - the entire screen filters next to the
13:00 - search bar
13:03 - or i'm sorry the sorting next to the
13:05 - search bar and then filters down one of
13:08 - the sides
13:17 - oh cool when nikki says the uh logitech
13:20 - 920
13:21 - is often used for stream streaming so
13:24 - yeah i think i was looking at one of
13:26 - these
13:27 - 920 models
13:30 - so there's some of them i'm just trying
13:32 - to determine like what how good do i
13:35 - need it to be
13:37 - uh for for streaming because some of
13:40 - them are
13:41 - there's one that's
13:43 - you can stream
13:44 - you can record 4k
13:46 - and things like that i definitely don't
13:49 - you all don't need to see my face in 4k
13:51 - i'm pretty sure
14:00 - let's see all right michael says
14:03 - uh those aren't searches though the
14:05 - choices
14:06 - anyway when you start inputting in
14:08 - search bar brings up choices for
14:10 - departments
14:12 - um
14:20 - logitech has a gold box today on
14:22 - logitech
14:23 - all right i'm getting a lot of input on
14:26 - the um
14:27 - webcam okay so i'm not going to read it
14:28 - right now i'm going to wait and read it
14:30 - after
14:32 - let me start this pomodoro timer so we
14:33 - can get to work after 25 minutes i'm
14:35 - going to go back to the live chat and
14:36 - answer any questions that you you all
14:38 - may have put in there
14:41 - um
14:42 - and we can talk more about webcams then
14:46 - uh but right now
14:47 - [Music]
14:51 - let's start with the search bar all
14:52 - right we'll start with the first things
14:54 - that we're gonna have on the page and
14:55 - we'll work our way down so it'll be
14:57 - search bar first
14:59 - filter second
15:00 - i'm sorry i keep mixing these up forget
15:03 - what i just said search bar first
15:07 - sorting second over here
15:11 - and then filters
15:13 - somewhere on one of these sides
15:18 - all right so
15:19 - let's go into our our file first
15:23 - you can check out
15:27 - the
15:28 - where the search.js file so you can
15:31 - check out the github repo
15:33 - if you like the
15:35 - description
15:37 - for this video should have a link to the
15:39 - repository
15:42 - and
15:44 - let's go down to where we have that
15:45 - input
15:47 - here it is here's our search input
15:52 - and we haven't used the material design
15:54 - style
15:56 - for testing we just threw in a regular
15:58 - input so the first thing we're going to
16:00 - want to do is go to the
16:02 - material ui documentation
16:07 - and we're going to grab some code from
16:09 - there to be able to use this input we
16:11 - are up unless material ui came out with
16:14 - a new beta
16:15 - update within the last two days we are
16:18 - completely up to date so i did merge
16:20 - that other branch into master
16:22 - and i found out after i restarted the
16:25 - server
16:27 - i did find some things that broke in the
16:29 - ui
16:30 - so basically
16:32 - almost everything was fixed by me
16:34 - changing type to variant
16:39 - that was
16:40 - most of the work if you want to see
16:41 - specifically what i change go check the
16:44 - last few commits
16:47 - and that should give you an idea of what
16:50 - it takes to upgrade to the latest
16:52 - version of material ui
16:54 - uh in terms of dealing with braking
16:57 - changes luckily a lot of the braking
16:59 - changes dealt with components that we
17:00 - didn't even use
17:03 - so that was good for us
17:05 - so we should have this open
17:08 - material ui
17:09 - nope those are the icons
17:12 - there we are i always have a material ui
17:14 - window open somewhere
17:16 - okay so this is material uinext.com
17:20 - so we're using the latest beta version
17:23 - and actually
17:25 - let's refresh this
17:27 - see if we get the
17:29 - newest version
17:34 - what i refreshed it now i can't use this
17:37 - sidebar
17:38 - what is going on
17:41 - there we are okay beta 38. i
17:45 - that's what we're on so we're in beta 38
17:47 - we're all up to date let's check out our
17:51 - components
17:53 - and
17:54 - what do we have inputs
17:59 - text fields there we are
18:01 - okay so we're going to want a text field
18:05 - here's a search field
18:08 - i guess we could check out the code for
18:10 - the search field
18:12 - we're definitely going to need to bring
18:14 - in a text field
18:16 - so let's pull that in right now we'll
18:18 - bring in this import let me zoom in a
18:21 - bit so you all can see
18:23 - so we're importing text field
18:30 - and then
18:32 - we're also going to bring in
18:36 - uh
18:37 - we'll figure out what styles we need
18:40 - let's see textview
18:44 - yeah let's just pull in this text field
18:46 - styles we're probably going to need
18:48 - those
18:51 - and
18:55 - put um
19:00 - let's put them here
19:03 - as of right now my
19:05 - my organization for our styles object is
19:10 - basically just in the order that these
19:12 - elements appear on the page
19:15 - might not be the best way to do it but
19:18 - uh it it's working right now
19:21 - okay now let's find that
19:26 - let's see
19:28 - we already have our our handle change so
19:32 - we're good with that
19:42 - search
19:43 - there we are
19:49 - i'm not sure right now what is different
19:51 - about the search field it looks pretty
19:53 - much the same
19:56 - i guess we'll find out
19:58 - okay so we have this input now
20:00 - and at first i'm just going to put this
20:03 - in right above our current input
20:05 - so i can
20:07 - make sure that we have
20:11 - search
20:16 - type search
20:29 - all right
20:32 - uh you know what let's see
20:35 - we want this to be a controlled
20:37 - component let's see if
20:44 - let's see if that's how they're doing
20:46 - this one
21:00 - all right let's find that
21:04 - multi-line that's controlled
21:08 - where is that
21:16 - um
21:30 - i thought the last time i looked at this
21:32 - there was a version
21:35 - where they used the controlled input
21:41 - okay so it is just value here
21:47 - okay
21:48 - all right that should work then
21:52 - so we're going to add whoa not that
21:55 - uh so we're going to add this value
21:59 - here
22:00 - and we also need this
22:03 - on change
22:05 - here
22:07 - and let's get rid of this
22:10 - and see what we have
22:12 - label search
22:14 - i don't think i need that
22:22 - okay
22:32 - oh
22:35 - what is going on
22:38 - failed to save
22:42 - important text field
22:46 - what did i just do
23:10 - all right
23:11 - uh
23:12 - check check
23:23 - i don't know what just happened
23:27 - let's see if it caught our changes all
23:29 - right there we go
23:32 - text field
23:44 - i'll change your search results
23:52 - whoa
23:54 - that's not right
24:03 - i'm gonna check the live chat see if any
24:05 - of you caught what
24:06 - what i just did
24:15 - what the heck
24:28 - okay
24:30 - let's do this
24:33 - i'm going to grab this text field
24:36 - i'm going to
24:37 - copy it and throw it over here
24:41 - in our
24:43 - file of
24:44 - scraps and then
24:47 - i'm gonna go to the github report
25:01 - i'm gonna grab the original file
25:06 - so it wasn't let me undo the changes
25:08 - wonder if i can manually undo undo
25:21 - yeah i cannot do any of that
25:23 - um
25:25 - so we're gonna grab that file
25:31 - i guess i could just
25:37 - johnson i may have an extra closing
25:40 - bracket somewhere
25:51 - yeah it looks like i accidentally
25:53 - deleted some stuff
25:56 - right
25:58 - or pasted in some things that i
25:59 - shouldn't have
26:03 - i yeah i'm not exactly sure what
26:05 - happened
26:06 - so anyway i'll fix it right now
26:09 - uh i don't need any of that stuff that
26:11 - looks good so i'm just gonna copy
26:14 - um the
26:19 - let's see
26:25 - checkbox form control form control label
26:28 - checkbox
26:31 - svg
26:33 - okay so from here
26:39 - down to this second form control i think
26:41 - is what we need
26:44 - let's double check that we do have that
26:46 - classes select value
26:48 - okay
26:49 - i think that's that's it
26:57 - all right
27:06 - text field is not defined
27:13 - okay
27:15 - let's try this
27:18 - again did anybody catch what happened
27:21 - what did i do
27:28 - okay
27:30 - now let's save it
27:31 - okay successful save that time
27:35 - all right
27:38 - now
27:39 - there we are now i have a search field
27:43 - let's actually put search out there
27:46 - which
27:49 - probably not going to have it like that
27:51 - so let's do
27:53 - let's do our search for
27:55 - biology okay wonderful
28:01 - all right cool so it is it is searching
28:05 - okay maybe
28:07 - maybe since i said it was a search field
28:09 - it automatically gives me that x which
28:11 - is actually really cool
28:13 - very cool all right so we have our
28:16 - search field
28:18 - step one completed let's check our time
28:21 - 11 minutes left on our timer
28:24 - cool
28:26 - uh let's see
28:37 - okay sort by that's what we're doing now
28:40 - let's go grab all the stuff for sort by
28:43 - and first thing we're going to do is
28:44 - just move it up here
28:46 - and then once you do that then we can
28:48 - work on
28:50 - whatever else we need to make this
28:52 - look nice and be very obvious to the
28:55 - user what it's going to do
29:00 - so
29:01 - this
29:02 - was already put in i believe nikki was
29:04 - the one that that did put that in there
29:07 - so
29:09 - uh nikki already
29:11 - filled it in with the
29:13 - uh material design style
29:16 - so we won't have to worry about changing
29:18 - anything for that
29:19 - so right now
29:21 - this whole form controls like yep there
29:23 - we are
29:25 - so we're just going to take that
29:27 - and remove it from where it is we're
29:28 - going to move it up here
29:30 - above
29:39 - uh our
29:43 - we uh we're gonna move it up here but
29:45 - what we might want to do though is
29:46 - change
29:49 - change this form
29:53 - actually
29:54 - on submit
29:56 - is get form results
30:04 - we don't actually have
30:09 - a submit button there dewey
30:13 - and what is this svg
30:15 - i'm going to take this
30:18 - i'm going to take this out and this svg
30:24 - and i'm going to replace the forms
30:29 - with with this form control
30:44 - okay
30:47 - all right let's see how that looks
30:49 - whoa
30:54 - okay so now we have everything up here
30:55 - in this line
30:58 - and
31:01 - we're gonna
31:02 - i probably need to add some grid stuff
31:04 - here
31:10 - okay
31:16 - let's check out
31:18 - in material
31:20 - ui
31:22 - let's check out our layout stuff
31:26 - and see where our grid is
31:42 - i just want to see what
31:44 - okay grid container
31:46 - all right
31:53 - grid containers and grid items
31:56 - all right
31:57 - it's been a few weeks since i worked
31:58 - with this uh i just needed a refresher
32:01 - on the
32:04 - syntax
32:05 - okay
32:07 - so let's just put some containers in
32:09 - here
32:10 - uh we're definitely gonna want a
32:12 - container here and
32:15 - within the same grid container
32:18 - i want to have
32:26 - i guess we could put everything in the
32:28 - container
32:30 - let's try to put everything in one grid
32:31 - container right now
32:33 - and see if that works
32:46 - just
32:58 - oops
33:00 - that was it right grid grid yeah
33:07 - okay so we put it all in the grid
33:15 - oh john hanson has a good point here it
33:17 - says submit function in a form without a
33:20 - submit button is the enter key
33:23 - okay
33:33 - i guess that shouldn't be a problem
33:37 - since we're searching automatically
33:40 - there wouldn't really be a reason to hit
33:41 - the enter key the user could hit the
33:43 - enter key and it would seem like it
33:45 - worked anyway but because since we're
33:47 - just automatically searching
33:49 - so i guess that should be all right if
33:52 - anyone has a different reason why we
33:54 - should keep
33:55 - what we had before and let me know
33:59 - all right let's import grid as well
34:02 - um
34:18 - and as this component starts to get
34:20 - larger it's probably going to be a good
34:22 - idea to separate it out into multiple
34:25 - components
34:26 - but while we're building it we'll keep
34:28 - it all in one place once we get it to a
34:30 - place where it looks good this is you
34:32 - know pretty much what we want then we
34:33 - can separate it out
34:35 - i find as long as it's not too large
34:38 - it's easier to have it all in one spot
34:40 - while you're making it
34:42 - at least for me
34:45 - all right and i suppose let's we can
34:48 - grab this container
34:51 - do we already have a container class i
34:53 - think we do
34:55 - content container okay
35:00 - so this should work so
35:05 - let's see what it's done
35:11 - we need to add our um
35:13 - our grid items in now
35:15 - because it's going to look silly without
35:17 - it
35:18 - okay so
35:20 - we just need to add grid item and then
35:23 - we can add in our values for
35:27 - what we want
35:30 - we like how many rows we want this to
35:32 - take up
35:45 - okay
35:48 - so let's put around
36:05 - i'm just gonna put these in
36:09 - and not really worry about the values
36:11 - for now
36:13 - i just want to get it all in there
36:55 - all right
36:57 - and i apologize if i'm gonna
37:00 - be a little off today i started to get a
37:02 - headache
37:03 - i actually started to get really bad
37:04 - heartburn in a headache right before the
37:06 - stream so i took some
37:08 - uh pain medicine to try to get rid of
37:11 - the headache
37:13 - and uh it's starting to come back again
37:15 - so i'm gonna do my best
37:18 - i want to see how these
37:20 - i better type in something
37:23 - legitimate
37:24 - i want to see how these results look
37:28 - okay
37:32 - i mean this is makes sense this is
37:34 - exactly what i just told it to do
37:36 - uh
37:38 - so now let's go back
37:40 - and
37:42 - give this some legitimate values what do
37:45 - you have all right about two minutes i'm
37:47 - gonna come back to the live chat and
37:48 - answer
37:52 - answer all the questions
37:55 - for now let's go in here and give
37:59 - let's set this to 12. am i using
38:03 - let me see what i'm using am i using a
38:05 - 12
38:06 - grid
38:11 - let's inspect this for a second
38:22 - okay it looks like it is
38:26 - great
38:28 - at least for now that's
38:31 - skids we want
38:38 - all right let's go with
38:40 - let's go up here to our search bar
38:42 - uh let's give this
38:48 - um
38:49 - so out of 12
38:50 - let's give this
38:58 - nine
39:01 - and that can stay three
39:04 - and then that's down here
39:07 - let's take
39:09 - this
39:11 - grid
39:13 - and let's move it
39:18 - down below
39:20 - here
39:22 - and we'll keep this at 3
39:25 - and we'll make this
39:28 - a nine
39:31 - and that'll be all right because things
39:33 - ought to line up there we are
39:35 - so these will line up and these will
39:37 - line up
39:42 - okay
39:44 - hopefully now you see a little bit um
39:48 - a little bit more about
39:52 - what i was going for
39:54 - so the filters will be here
39:56 - right sort here so
40:00 - it doesn't really look like much right
40:01 - now i think we still have some work to
40:03 - put in for this but
40:06 - this is about what we're going if you
40:08 - think the filters would definitely look
40:10 - better on this side let me know we can
40:12 - do that
40:15 - that won't really be a problem
40:18 - for now
40:20 - uh my timer just went off so i'm going
40:22 - to take a five minute break i am gonna
40:24 - take a drink here
40:37 - so
40:39 - as always i'm drinking my g fuel
40:42 - i put up a post on uh instagram with my
40:45 - g fuel in it
40:47 - and i tag g fuel in it
40:50 - and
40:51 - i gave him a little hint that
40:54 - they got an opportunity for me to be a
40:56 - spokesperson if they want it
41:01 - so they didn't get back to me though
41:03 - not yet they you know they might be busy
41:05 - maybe they'll get back to me later this
41:06 - week
41:09 - all right
41:10 - oops let me start this
41:14 - all right so five minutes i'm gonna try
41:16 - to get through as many questions as i
41:17 - can
41:20 - all right nikki says hey excited for f1
41:23 - to start again this weekend
41:26 - cool i'm i'm not really a racing fan i'm
41:29 - not anti-racing but i just
41:33 - don't often watch it but i'm glad you're
41:35 - excited for it
41:37 - nikki says i hope daniel ricardo
41:40 - rick ricciardo
41:43 - said does well
41:45 - uh
41:46 - cool again i'm not really
41:48 - knowledgeable about racing but
41:50 - good luck daniel
41:53 - uh
41:55 - but
41:57 - matthias says hi jesse love your stuff
41:59 - keep it up thank you i appreciate that
42:02 - and i plan on keeping it up for as long
42:04 - as i can
42:05 - as long as it's beneficial to you all i
42:07 - will keep doing this
42:09 - james ross says it's the new project a
42:11 - beard
42:13 - no i've completed that project i
42:16 - that was our last project
42:20 - the beard will probably be leaving soon
42:23 - it's it's gonna start getting warmer now
42:25 - despite all the snow that that a lot of
42:27 - us got uh yesterday
42:30 - it is gonna start getting warmer and
42:32 - then beards aren't as fun
42:35 - santiago says greetings from venezuela
42:39 - uh the game sounds like a good idea oh
42:41 - thank you thank you so that was if you
42:43 - weren't here at the beginning i gave
42:44 - kind of my plan for one of my side
42:46 - projects so you can
42:49 - if you're interested in my side project
42:51 - that has to do with brain human
42:55 - interface or brain computer interfaces
42:58 - check it out uh on the recording you
43:00 - just go back and watch the first like 10
43:02 - minutes
43:04 - uh let's see
43:08 - i'm scrolling down to find some
43:10 - questions
43:15 - all right so here was some discussion
43:17 - about
43:18 - what the best
43:20 - camera is for streaming that i should
43:22 - get so if anybody has any experience
43:24 - with webcams please let me know your
43:26 - opinion uh basically the logitech 920
43:30 - series seems like something that i
43:33 - should look into
43:34 - um
43:35 - i don't
43:36 - the only thing that i ever really do is
43:38 - like
43:40 - images of me right like doing this just
43:42 - like i'm doing now
43:44 - so
43:45 - i don't know what quality i really need
43:48 - i saw one that's uh a pretty good deal
43:51 - on amazon i think it was only like 40 or
43:54 - 50 dollars
43:55 - which was discounted from the the normal
43:58 - price
43:59 - and it could do
44:01 - you can record in 1080p but you can only
44:04 - stream in 720.
44:06 - i think that would be okay
44:08 - i mean i don't
44:10 - let me know if you think that quality
44:11 - would be all right for me
44:13 - uh i
44:15 - i mean i really i'd rather not spend a
44:17 - ton of money and i don't make any money
44:18 - from streaming so
44:21 - it's it's not like an investment for me
44:23 - it's just
44:24 - would be a little bit better quality so
44:27 - anyway if you have any experience with
44:29 - webcams uh especially if you're
44:31 - streaming with them
44:33 - uh please let me know what what you all
44:35 - think is is a good one preferably one
44:37 - under a hundred dollars
44:52 - okay daniel says uh daniel frank says i
44:55 - can personally vouch for the 920 and it
44:58 - has worked in my enterprise for three
44:59 - years straight everyday use oh excellent
45:02 - that's exactly what i wanted that's
45:04 - that's really uh good advice
45:07 - uh i mean you know you
45:09 - you can read all you want online you can
45:11 - read reviews but it's much better to
45:13 - like really talk to somebody who knows
45:14 - so uh i appreciate that daniel
45:26 - oh michael says about search bar stuff i
45:28 - like the amazon drop down incorporated
45:31 - into the search bar
45:33 - then the autofill entries into the
45:36 - search results not sure how hard that is
45:40 - in react
45:47 - okay so is that
45:49 - somewhat like what we're what we're
45:50 - doing that the filters are kind of with
45:54 - the search results and then the drop
45:56 - down is kind of with the
45:58 - i know it's not as closely with it as on
46:01 - amazon but i think that's a bit what
46:02 - we're going with that general idea
46:13 - michael says or to save space especially
46:15 - on mobile have a multi-select drop down
46:17 - that autofills with returned available
46:20 - filters
46:21 - yeah that's what i'm planning on doing
46:23 - on mobile so definitely
46:25 - basically the only thing you'll see
46:26 - right off the bat on mobile is the
46:28 - search field everything else will be in
46:31 - a drop down
46:36 - yeah it'll be in a
46:38 - multi-select drop down
46:40 - maybe i'll have the sort by in its own
46:44 - drop down
46:45 - as well i don't
46:47 - i don't want to get too crazy and have
46:49 - too much stuff uh you know because the
46:51 - mobile
46:52 - you only have limited space on mobile so
46:54 - we'll see how much space we can get but
46:56 - that's basically what i'm uh what i was
46:58 - thinking i'm going with
47:01 - okay
47:02 - i
47:03 - am almost
47:05 - to the bottom of the live chat so
47:10 - let me see i don't think there's that
47:11 - many questions left
47:13 - uh
47:15 - so i may go ahead even though my timer
47:17 - went off i might try to get just these
47:18 - last few
47:20 - just don't want to keep you all waiting
47:21 - with for the answers for too long
47:25 - let's see
47:33 - uh jason lee asks what's the timers for
47:35 - is this a freelance project the timer is
47:38 - just to break up our time here so that i
47:40 - don't spend too much time talking or too
47:42 - much time coding
47:44 - we get a nice kind of break in between i
47:46 - also use the pomodoro timer just to
47:48 - break up my day it's not a freelance
47:51 - project this is uh i'm a front-end
47:53 - developer i work full-time
47:57 - salary for a university
48:16 - ah let's see
48:22 - software dev says it is interesting that
48:24 - you've got tags like grid control and
48:26 - form control is that precompiled in
48:28 - normal html tags and the javascript is
48:31 - within the html
48:34 - all right nikki says it's not really
48:35 - html just looks like it all right so
48:37 - this is a good segue back into the code
48:39 - here so let's um
48:42 - let's go over this
48:49 - yeah let me go over this now then so let
48:51 - me start our our coding timer and the
48:53 - first thing we'll do is just kind of do
48:54 - a quick recap of what we've done
48:57 - to go over some of these these tags so
48:59 - software dev is asking about these tags
49:02 - so
49:03 - um basically
49:05 - if you're not and i'm not assuming
49:08 - software dev that you're not familiar
49:09 - with react but anybody out there that's
49:11 - not that familiar with react all of this
49:14 - here looks a lot like html but it's
49:16 - actually not it's it's jsx and what this
49:20 - is is is syntactic sugar on top of
49:23 - javascript functions to create dom
49:26 - elements
49:28 - uh so really what what these will break
49:32 - down into is a javascript function
49:35 - that's going to create
49:37 - a select field and create these items
49:39 - within these select fields but that's
49:41 - really hard to write if you're used to
49:43 - html it's kind of a pain to write all
49:45 - these functions like uh think of like
49:47 - continually writing like
49:48 - document.creator or uh get element by id
49:52 - or create it yeah you know what i'm
49:53 - saying it's it's a lot
49:55 - so this makes it easier that we can
49:57 - write basically what looks and acts
50:00 - pretty much like normal html so when we
50:02 - write things like this like this grid
50:05 - it ends up turning into something else
50:07 - so we can see what it turns into here
50:14 - uh so
50:16 - we have this div with a class of mui
50:20 - grid right the classes are
50:23 - get kind of crazy
50:25 - but and within it we have a field set
50:27 - all right we have a legend a div labels
50:31 - spans
50:32 - more spans
50:34 - svgs
50:35 - inputs right so all of that comes from
50:39 - just adding in in that case the select
50:42 - and these menu items within within this
50:45 - or i'm sorry that was the check boxes
50:46 - we're looking at from just adding in
50:48 - this grid form control form labels and
50:51 - check boxes
50:52 - okay so
50:54 - each one of these is a separate
50:56 - component that exists in a separate
50:59 - javascript file somewhere within our
51:00 - project and in particular most of these
51:04 - exist within the material
51:06 - ui uh
51:10 - package so it's it's in our node modules
51:12 - folder
51:14 - so
51:15 - yeah so it doesn't exactly behave like
51:17 - normal html
51:19 - and there's a lot more to it obviously
51:22 - but it's kind of hidden away and it lets
51:24 - us
51:25 - you know have markup that's that's
51:27 - cleaner
51:29 - and we can still have control over it by
51:31 - passing in these properties so these
51:33 - props will change things and give us
51:35 - some versatility for those components
51:39 - so hopefully that was
51:40 - a decent explanation of
51:44 - a little bit of how react works
51:47 - and hopefully it answered your question
51:48 - if it didn't let me know and then after
51:50 - this pomodoro session then i can go back
51:53 - and
51:54 - try to do a better job
52:00 - okay so if i didn't get to your question
52:01 - right now i will get it to it at the end
52:03 - i know there were a few there at the
52:04 - bottom that i didn't get to
52:08 - and
52:09 - okay so let's
52:13 - let's work on these
52:15 - uh let's move the label for sort by up
52:17 - because right now this this looks kind
52:19 - of odd side by side
52:21 - so we have the labels kind of opposite
52:23 - so
52:25 - let's just switch that around now should
52:27 - be something easy
52:28 - and
52:29 - i think it'll look a lot nicer
52:32 - let's
52:33 - deform upper text
52:36 - let's put that
52:40 - up here
52:41 - see what that does for us
52:45 - there we are
52:46 - we still have
52:49 - some padding issues here let's see what
52:51 - what's going on
52:54 - so right now we have our
52:57 - grid container our grid item form
53:00 - control
53:01 - the text field must be what has the
53:03 - extra padding because
53:05 - right we have grid form control
53:09 - here right so it's the same let's see
53:11 - what kind
53:12 - of class text field let's see what we
53:15 - have going on here on our on our text
53:17 - field
53:18 - styles
53:22 - with margin left marching right with
53:24 - okay we don't have any extra
53:26 - margins or paddings
53:28 - margin or padding happening okay
53:34 - all right
53:35 - let's
53:36 - then look look into uh devtools and see
53:39 - what's going on
53:42 - okay
53:43 - form control
53:44 - the form control here
53:49 - oh let's see
53:50 - do we have a difference here
53:54 - all right this form control
53:57 - it is giving us class name form
54:00 - interesting
54:06 - so this
54:08 - has a in a div within the normal form
54:12 - control div
54:18 - that says page text field
54:21 - so let's check out here
54:23 - what we have going on
54:27 - and we don't have that happening here
54:33 - okay
54:43 - all right let's see
54:47 - all right michael's saying isn't the
54:48 - search field text built into the search
54:51 - element
54:52 - is the select a material ui element
54:56 - i thought it was a material let me
54:58 - double check
54:59 - yeah that's definitely a mature ui
55:01 - element
55:04 - so that's not default select behavior
55:07 - um
55:10 - okay let's see
55:28 - all right so the style of that margin
55:36 - that's this 16 pixel margin here
55:41 - and 8 at the bottom
55:43 - and that's coming from
55:45 - margin normal
55:50 - so why don't we have that it's just it
55:53 - entirely
55:57 - not creating another
56:00 - it's it's creating this item type
56:04 - that's really odd
56:18 - hmm
56:22 - that's really odd
56:26 - all right john hanson is saying add a
56:28 - line items baseline on that wrapping div
56:32 - okay we'll try it out in devtools first
56:36 - and
56:36 - we should have
56:46 - there we go
57:11 - all right not making a difference
57:16 - um
57:25 - the furthest div
57:27 - she's saying this this whole container
57:44 - okay
57:46 - all right let's shout out then
57:51 - whoa baseline
57:53 - okay so all right so we have a line
57:55 - items baseline going now
57:57 - [Music]
58:00 - and then
58:21 - oh why is it doing this now
58:38 - so we have this gap right here
58:41 - why do we have this gap
58:48 - css is a fun mystery
58:50 - sometimes
58:55 - all right where's my gap coming from
59:18 - all right is there any difference here
59:38 - we have this align items on here but
59:40 - that's about it
59:49 - uh john asked if i took out that first
59:51 - baseline that i had it i was that's what
59:53 - i was thinking and i think it was here
59:55 - and i must have accidentally set it to
59:56 - left but that's it i mean it's
59:59 - that was where i added it in so it's
60:00 - gone now
60:20 - it's just weird
60:24 - anyone have any idea why
60:26 - why it's doing this
60:32 - excuse me i'm gonna get another drink
60:33 - here
60:34 - while i ponder this problem
60:55 - okay
61:00 - hmm
61:02 - let's play with
61:04 - um
61:07 - let's play with this
61:48 - all right baseline center looks pretty
61:50 - good obviously
61:52 - these don't this doesn't look good and
61:55 - this looks okay right now but if there
61:57 - were only a few items it would
62:00 - take it down
62:01 - well i guess it
62:03 - it would show up in the middle so that
62:04 - wouldn't look good but what we can do is
62:10 - we could change
62:13 - it might be easier to just do it on here
62:16 - let's let's try this for a second let's
62:18 - take out this align item center here
62:21 - and then
62:23 - how do we do it uh
62:27 - align
62:29 - align self
62:32 - center
62:34 - okay so
62:35 - uh if you're using flexbox
62:38 - which i believe the grid system is
62:42 - uh
62:42 - this grid system and material ui is
62:44 - based on flexbox so it's a little
62:46 - misleading because it's calling it grid
62:49 - but it's not using css grid it's using
62:51 - flexbox correct me if i'm wrong but i'm
62:54 - it looks like from the css that
62:56 - everything's based on flex
62:58 - so what we've done is the standard for
63:01 - everything
63:03 - is still in place
63:06 - but on this one particular element we
63:09 - want to change the behavior so we use a
63:12 - line self
63:13 - center and then it can change changes
63:16 - this
63:17 - alignment to center and it doesn't
63:20 - affect any of the other ones
63:21 - does that make sense
63:26 - so let's go with that and let's add
63:29 - i'm not going to make a class i'm going
63:31 - to add this in right on that element
63:33 - because right now it doesn't look like
63:35 - we're going to have to repeat that
63:41 - so
63:45 - let's go over here
63:47 - to our
63:49 - grid
63:52 - and
63:53 - we're going to style
63:55 - we're going to style and then in react
63:59 - when we want to put a style on something
64:02 - we're actually going to make a
64:04 - javascript object
64:06 - so the first set of curly brackets
64:10 - lets us start writing javascript within
64:12 - this jsx
64:14 - so we've switched from kind of like the
64:16 - html like mode
64:18 - and now within these brackets we're in
64:20 - javascript mode so we can write
64:23 - pretty much the same way that we would
64:24 - write normal javascript
64:27 - and
64:28 - then so now i'm creating an object
64:30 - within there and now i can put the the
64:32 - style in there
64:33 - so we're going to do
64:35 - a line self
64:37 - and we can can we need to camel case
64:39 - that right because this is javascript if
64:41 - i put a line hyphen self it's going to
64:43 - think i'm trying to i'll take a line
64:45 - minus self
64:48 - okay so align self
64:50 - and then the next one we're going to
64:51 - make a string
64:54 - so everything unless it's just a pure
64:56 - number needs to be a string
64:59 - on
65:00 - on the right hand side of the colon
65:03 - and so we're going to say center
65:06 - okay
65:08 - and now when we save
65:10 - this will show up
65:13 - like an inline style one here
65:17 - so let's make
65:20 - sure yeah
65:22 - let's uh hit refresh just to
65:25 - verify we'll do an actual page refresh
65:30 - and
65:31 - there we are
65:33 - so you can see we still have this align
65:36 - self center
65:38 - and now that i look at it
65:41 - does that still look a little off to you
65:48 - that actually still looks a little off
65:50 - let's see if we can
65:52 - squish this together to get a better
65:54 - look at
65:57 - uh you know what it's it's not really
65:59 - that off i thought it was farther off
66:02 - so you can see here
66:04 - whoa
66:06 - so you can see here our lines are just a
66:08 - bit off
66:10 - and
66:11 - when it pops up his search field it's a
66:13 - bit off but i
66:16 - i'll live with that for right now
66:20 - um
66:24 - what do you all think i mean just for
66:25 - the sake of moving on
66:29 - i think we can live with that
66:31 - uh so
66:33 - i mean one reason is
66:35 - the screen's never going to be that
66:36 - small showing these side by side like
66:38 - that we'll switch to a mobile version
66:40 - that'll be different
66:42 - so
66:44 - when it's that far apart
66:49 - i don't know i'm okay with it for now
66:52 - it'll probably bother me for a while
66:53 - though let's refresh that again what's
66:56 - going on here
67:06 - the styles are definitely messed up here
67:10 - oh you know what
67:26 - see if that does anything
67:28 - no
67:51 - there we are
67:52 - okay
67:54 - uh i think what happened was
68:00 - the changes
68:03 - oh yeah i pulled in all the changes but
68:05 - i forgot to run yarn
68:07 - uh or npm install
68:10 - so i didn't get the latest version
68:13 - of
68:15 - uh of material ui
68:18 - so that was that was why these
68:20 - the size was all off
68:23 - okay all right now we're good
68:29 - and
68:30 - for these uh filter results for now
68:34 - the only thing i really want to do
68:36 - is decrease
68:39 - the padding in between these
68:43 - i just think it's a bit much
68:45 - once we get more filters in there
68:48 - then we can take a look and and really
68:51 - see like do we need
68:52 - you know how do we need to organize
68:54 - these
68:55 - uh but for now
69:00 - let's just decrease the padding a bit
69:02 - let's see do we still we like that color
69:06 - you know what i also want to change i
69:07 - may not do it today i don't think we'll
69:08 - have time today but i like to change it
69:11 - so that
69:12 - if you click this it only does a search
69:15 - again
69:16 - if
69:17 - there's actually some text in that
69:19 - search field
69:21 - so i i don't want it to just
69:25 - give you
69:28 - like automatically search when there's
69:30 - nothing in the search field
69:37 - oh um yusuf uh asked for it ngrok link
69:40 - yeah i'll paste it in there again i
69:42 - pasted it earlier and i forgot to paste
69:44 - it again
69:45 - uh here you are
69:52 - all right michael creo saying for now
69:53 - added to do yeah actually that's not a
69:55 - bad idea let's add some to do's
69:58 - in here
70:04 - to do
70:19 - more precisely is that how you spell
70:20 - precisely
70:23 - do you all ever just avoid using a word
70:25 - you don't know how to spell because you
70:26 - don't feel like actually verifying how
70:29 - it's spelled
70:33 - um
70:35 - and then what else did i just say we
70:37 - were gonna do
70:43 - oh okay with the search here so let's
70:45 - let's put this up here in the
70:48 - filter filter filter filter
70:52 - filter by category
71:19 - okay
71:23 - all right now let's check out what's
71:25 - going on with our padding here
71:37 - and i just want to see where that all
71:39 - that padding is coming from
71:43 - and it looks like
71:44 - it's not actually padding it's its
71:46 - height
71:53 - so we have margin right margin left
71:56 - right flex vertical in the middle
71:59 - so where where are we getting that
72:01 - height from
72:09 - maybe it's in here
72:14 - height 48
72:19 - all right if we drop that height let's
72:21 - see what our computed height is
72:29 - okay so why is our computed
72:34 - height let's check back here
72:37 - uh it's saying our computer right is 48.
72:42 - i mean that that does make sense
72:46 - interesting
72:50 - okay let's
72:52 - let's check this out
72:53 - where are we getting the height
72:55 - directly
73:00 - okay so that's on the button
73:03 - icon
73:04 - button
73:05 - which we don't directly have control
73:07 - over here huh
73:09 - menu i don't know that's not it oh we
73:11 - have these
73:15 - okay so within our check box
73:22 - we're going to have to look at the
73:23 - material ui documentation to see if we
73:25 - can change that i realize why they do
73:27 - that they want the check boxes to be
73:29 - easily clickable by someone's finger or
73:31 - thumb
73:32 - uh but if we're on a desktop we don't
73:35 - really need to worry about that
73:37 - uh so yeah so john just i just see in
73:39 - the live chat john's saying the same
73:41 - thing that that is 48 pixels is pretty
73:44 - standard
73:45 - for being clickable so
73:49 - i'm willing to go below that standard
73:51 - only for large screens
73:54 - i do want to keep that standard
73:57 - for smaller screens so actually my
74:00 - pomodoro timer just ran out so i think
74:03 - we'll keep it for now
74:04 - and i'll consider whether we should have
74:07 - right now it really doesn't matter like
74:09 - i mean this is fine
74:12 - my worry is if we get a lot more items
74:15 - it's it's going to be
74:16 - this is going to be too much it'll be
74:18 - overwhelming like the length of all the
74:20 - the options here so
74:23 - i guess this is something we'll revisit
74:26 - once we get more content here
74:30 - and and then we'll see what we need to
74:32 - do so
74:34 - let's commit these changes
74:38 - uh so let's go in our terminal here
74:41 - and for those of you who are new to the
74:43 - terminal and new to git and github
74:47 - i'm going to just explain what i'm doing
74:49 - while i'm doing it so i'm in the
74:50 - terminal i'm in the folder for this
74:53 - project
74:56 - and
74:56 - i'm going to do git status
75:01 - so if you have git installed on your
75:03 - computer you can use the command git
75:06 - so the git status is telling me that two
75:08 - files have changed the search.js file
75:11 - that we've been working in which we
75:12 - expect to change and then this yarn lock
75:15 - and that's whenever i went in and and
75:17 - ran the yarn command
75:19 - it changed this lock file so that's also
75:22 - expected even though we didn't directly
75:25 - uh do anything to log file
75:27 - which generally you shouldn't directly
75:29 - do anything to your lock file anyway
75:31 - so now that we've verified that these
75:33 - are the files that
75:35 - we expected to be changed
75:38 - we can do
75:40 - in this case we're going to run this
75:41 - command called yarn cm now this is
75:44 - probably going to be unfamiliar if you
75:46 - haven't watched any streams because this
75:48 - is kind of a
75:50 - custom setup i'm not we didn't make it
75:52 - all custom but
75:54 - the command whoa
75:59 - we never added it oh okay get ad i need
76:02 - to add first i need to add these files
76:05 - to
76:06 - the staging area
76:08 - so git add and then if i add a little
76:10 - dot a little period after that it'll
76:12 - just stage everything
76:14 - everything that changed
76:16 - so
76:17 - if we do a git status you can see now
76:19 - these have changed to green and
76:21 - they're in the
76:23 - uh staging areas it says changes to be
76:26 - committed
76:27 - now we're going to commit with yarn cm
76:30 - all this is going to do
76:32 - this is just kind of a layer on top of
76:34 - the normal git command so it's just
76:36 - going to walk us through how to write a
76:38 - good commit message and then just run a
76:41 - git commit on that
76:45 - so we're going to say it's a new feature
76:49 - and let's say
76:52 - update
76:54 - search ui
76:56 - and there are no breaking changes and i
76:59 - don't think this affects any issues
77:01 - now it's going to do a bunch of
77:02 - automated testing
77:06 - which this potentially depending on
77:10 - how good of a computer you have this
77:13 - could be
77:14 - a much longer process
77:18 - we did get one warning here
77:20 - since it was a warning we still passed
77:22 - and we can still do this but i believe
77:24 - this is due to our update to the newest
77:26 - version of material ui so for right now
77:29 - it's a warning
77:31 - but at some point we should check this
77:33 - out
77:35 - and see like perhaps this just isn't
77:37 - used anymore
77:40 - uh so we still have it in there and it's
77:42 - kind of a little confusing here to react
77:44 - so we'll see
77:45 - see what that is but not not an
77:47 - emergency type of thing so now that we
77:49 - have our commit message we're going to
77:51 - push this up to github so if you're
77:53 - using github in addition to git which a
77:56 - lot of people do you'll want to make
77:57 - sure you sync up everything you've done
77:59 - locally on your machine
78:01 - with github
78:03 - so that other people can see what you've
78:04 - done and you can access that on other
78:07 - computers as well and and they can too
78:10 - so we're just going to do a git push
78:13 - origin
78:14 - since we're on the master branch it'll
78:15 - automatically push to origin master if
78:18 - we wanted to push this to a different
78:19 - branch we could have done git push
78:20 - origin and then put the name of that
78:22 - other branch that we wanted to push to
78:25 - and that's it
78:27 - all done so now everything we've done
78:28 - today all the updates are available now
78:30 - on the get uh github repo the link is in
78:33 - the description to this video you all
78:35 - can use that do whatever you want with
78:37 - the code it's entirely uh free and open
78:40 - source
78:41 - and uh have have fun with it
78:46 - okay
78:48 - let me go to the live chat now and
78:50 - answer as many questions as as you all
78:52 - have if you do have any more questions
78:54 - please put them in the live chat now
78:56 - uh if you for whatever reason don't want
78:58 - to put your question in the live chat
78:59 - but you still like to ask it just reach
79:01 - out to me on any social media platform
79:05 - uh my the link to my github channel is

79:08 - and from there you can see um on the
79:11 - home page of my channel all my links to
79:13 - all my different social media things

79:22 - asks me a question
79:23 - at some point
79:45 - uh
79:46 - as she says hi i learned c plus plus and
79:50 - java right now i am uh in free code camp
79:53 - hoping i will understand your topic
79:56 - okay great i um yeah i hope that you get
79:59 - something useful out of this feel free
80:02 - to ask as many questions as you need to

80:53 - i can't um answer that i
80:57 - i have
80:58 - almost no experience with c sharp
81:01 - uh i've just i've done a little bit when
81:03 - i've had to for this job
81:05 - so i don't really know if anybody else
81:06 - has experience with c sharp and knows of
81:08 - any good books please let us know in the
81:10 - live chat
81:12 - newshour asks what motivates you
81:15 - um
81:17 - i think there's a lot of different
81:18 - factors that that can motivate me so
81:20 - it's it's not usually one thing all the
81:22 - time you know it depends so
81:24 - uh obviously the overall you know
81:27 - motivation
81:29 - uh
81:31 - for me
81:32 - is to provide for my family right i mean
81:35 - that's like baseline you got to take
81:37 - care of your
81:38 - your basic needs before you can take
81:40 - care of anything else right so just
81:42 - making sure that my family has enough to
81:45 - eat you know i can
81:46 - put them through school have a house
81:48 - form and things like that
81:50 - right
81:51 - but i could really do that with any job
81:53 - so for specifically for coding what
81:56 - motivates me is number one i really i
81:59 - like to do this i think it's fun are
82:01 - there moments that are frustrating oh
82:04 - absolutely do i sometimes have to work
82:06 - on projects that aren't as fun yeah it
82:09 - happens but overall in general i really
82:11 - like this when
82:13 - when i'm home and on like the very rare
82:16 - occasions when i don't have any kids at
82:18 - home
82:19 - uh
82:20 - like
82:21 - coding is one of the things that i think
82:22 - oh i'm just gonna code like a side
82:24 - project to do something right so i it's
82:27 - it's like a hobby but i get paid for it
82:29 - okay so i do like it
82:31 - uh also
82:34 - um
82:34 - and i hope this doesn't sound bad but uh
82:38 - can competition motivates me right i
82:40 - like i want to be better i don't want to
82:43 - be better in the sense that i enjoy
82:45 - watching other people
82:47 - get beat right like this is you know
82:49 - one-on-one competition no i want
82:51 - everybody to get better but
82:53 - like i enjoy being better myself so in
82:55 - the healthiest version of competition
82:57 - where i want to be the best but i want
83:00 - all the competitors to be at the top of
83:02 - their game
83:03 - right so we can all get better together
83:06 - uh so hopefully that makes sense right
83:08 - like there are some people who want to
83:09 - win no matter what and
83:11 - it doesn't matter to them like if their
83:13 - opponent gets the flu and they win
83:14 - they're just as happy well that's that's
83:16 - not me
83:17 - right i'd i wouldn't be happy about that
83:19 - i want everybody to be really good and
83:21 - then
83:22 - push me to be really good too so
83:25 - um
83:27 - i don't know i think that's that's just
83:29 - an exciting thing
83:31 - uh to just try to find out like
83:35 - how much better can i be in building
83:37 - things you know
83:41 - and ultimately being better in web
83:43 - development means making things that are
83:45 - more useful to people there are more
83:47 - easily accessible that make their lives
83:49 - easier that that look beautiful
83:52 - you know that's that's what better means
83:54 - so
83:55 - i'm not gauging success in terms of
83:58 - motivation you know really by money
84:01 - in terms of providing for my family
84:03 - money is
84:05 - you know obviously what i need to gauge
84:07 - that by
84:08 - in addition to being able to spend time
84:10 - with them
84:11 - but then in terms of being motivated by
84:13 - wanting to be better
84:15 - it has almost nothing to do with money
84:17 - it's
84:18 - you know
84:18 - is what i'm making is it quality work
84:21 - you know is it really helping people so
84:23 - anyway
84:26 - i hope that wasn't too long of an answer
84:27 - for you all but those are kind of some
84:29 - of my my motivators and sometimes when
84:31 - you're just down you got to make up your
84:33 - own motivators like or you gotta have
84:36 - help so like you gotta drink an energy
84:38 - drink or give yourself like little
84:40 - things like okay if i every time i
84:42 - finish a new pomodoro session uh i'm
84:45 - gonna like eat a bite of chocolate or do
84:48 - something that
84:49 - uh that you wanna do like i've actually
84:52 - done it before where like every time i
84:53 - had a five minute break in my pomodoro
84:55 - session i would watch five minutes of a
84:58 - netflix show
85:01 - which is silly to watch five minutes at
85:03 - a time but like that was my reward to
85:05 - get me through
85:07 - that that little portion i think at the
85:10 - time i was putting in like crazy hours
85:12 - so it's just like anything that i could
85:14 - do to just
85:15 - uh keep going so anyway those are some
85:17 - of the things that motivate me and on
85:19 - any given day i might be more or less
85:22 - motivated by one of those things but you
85:25 - know together it really keeps me
85:27 - on track and passionate about what i'm
85:29 - doing
85:30 - let me know what you all think is
85:32 - motivating for you i'm really interested
85:34 - to hear what motivates other people
85:37 - so let me know in the chat
85:39 - uh or in the comments the video or even
85:42 - uh in social media somehow
85:46 - tag me in in it or whatever you can even
85:49 - dm me if you want
85:53 - let's see
85:56 - okay uh why
85:58 - why didn't you join any company
86:00 - well i mean i'm not
86:03 - i work for university
86:05 - um
86:08 - so
86:10 - i guess that counts as a company right
86:17 - john hanson says for mobile just use a
86:19 - modal for filters and sorting
86:23 - yeah i could
86:27 - i'm either going to use a drop down or
86:30 - in material ui you can actually have two
86:32 - different drawers come out so i could
86:34 - have the one drawer come out for the
86:36 - main menu and i could have a drawer come
86:38 - out of the other side the right side
86:40 - for
86:41 - the filters
86:44 - so i just have to figure out what
86:48 - what button are people going to press to
86:49 - get to those filters
86:52 - that might be kind of cool
86:54 - i'll have to remember that
86:59 - michael says a bunch of new people in
87:01 - here today that's a good thing yeah
87:03 - definitely for everyone that's new here
87:04 - welcome i really appreciate you watching
87:06 - i know towards the end here we've kind
87:08 - of dropped off so i wish i would have
87:09 - acknowledged you all earlier when there
87:11 - were you know about twice as many people
87:13 - in here uh but
87:15 - if you stuck around if you're here uh
87:18 - yeah thank you so much for watching and
87:21 - i really want to be receptive to what
87:23 - you all want so any advice you have for
87:25 - me or any questions please let me know
87:28 - i'm
87:30 - i'm usually super nice about everything
87:32 - so
87:33 - i'm cool with criticism you know try to
87:35 - be nice but if you must be mean i'm not
87:38 - going to cry
87:39 - at least on camera
87:41 - but
87:43 - but anyway i'm serious i want to make
87:45 - this better so let me know what would
87:46 - you all want you know what kind of
87:48 - things you like what kind of things you
87:49 - don't like
88:08 - all right
88:16 - not too many questions left let's see
88:18 - noble and savage says woot hi all hey
88:21 - how's it going
88:22 - thanks for joining us
88:32 - oh john hanson says use a negative
88:35 - margin left on the input titles this
88:37 - won't impact on the standard clickable
88:39 - area
88:42 - okay i think i like i like that idea
88:44 - well i'm not gonna do it right now um
88:48 - but when it comes time for us to really
88:50 - start getting detailed on this as we get
88:53 - more of uh the filters on here
88:56 - yeah i'll definitely want to mess with
88:58 - this to to see
89:01 - if it looks better you know with them
89:03 - being closer
89:05 - that's a good trick
89:09 - uh nino says do you know when
89:12 - why
89:14 - um
89:15 - just for the terminal vibe
89:18 - v-e-n-v
89:21 - what's
89:23 - i'm not sure what that is was it
89:24 - supposed to be end i don't know uh in
89:26 - python can't be active from the terminal
89:29 - uh in visual studio code
89:32 - i i have no idea i i haven't done
89:34 - anything with python for
89:37 - years
89:38 - so
89:39 - i really have no ideas i'm sorry
89:47 - michael says i've been playing around
89:49 - with graphql slash react for a day or so
89:53 - so
89:54 - when i think like i understand what's
89:56 - going on watch out you might have a
89:58 - harsher 2.0
90:00 - all right i'm looking forward to it yeah
90:02 - unfortunately i had to stream later
90:04 - today because i had other stuff going on
90:05 - so i know
90:06 - harsh it's most likely sleeping at least
90:09 - i hope he's sleeping it should be it's
90:10 - really late where he's at
90:12 - uh so i'm gonna try to stream earlier
90:15 - uh tomorrow if i can
90:18 - and
90:19 - i know he's busy right now with school
90:21 - so maybe he can join us for those of you
90:22 - who don't know harshad he's
90:25 - a veteran i guess of the channel and
90:27 - very outspoken in
90:29 - helping me
90:31 - when i'm doing something
90:32 - wrong uh but it it truly is it is
90:36 - helpful
90:42 - michael says but i'm three times his age
90:44 - so that's kind of creepy
90:46 - that's true yeah harshit is only 16. um
90:49 - and actually when he was 15 when he
90:51 - started watching the the streams and
90:53 - uh very smart
90:55 - i think he's gonna
90:57 - he's gonna be a very good programmer if
90:59 - he keeps going at this pace
91:01 - he's already good
91:08 - let's see
91:09 - carlos says jesse can you explain the
91:11 - yarn command on git
91:13 - oh yeah for sure let me explain that
91:16 - that again so
91:18 - what we did here on the terminal let me
91:20 - go up and show you
91:21 - um
91:24 - so instead of doing a regular git commit
91:27 - we did yarn cm
91:31 - and then we got these little prompts
91:33 - that basically writes a commit message
91:35 - for us
91:36 - and then
91:38 - the commit actually happens so let me
91:40 - scroll down i wonder if you would be
91:42 - able to see it yeah so here's where
91:46 - the commit happens
91:49 - so you see this is the commit message
91:51 - that we actually got
91:52 - feet right for new feature because we
91:54 - said yes we selected that option and
91:57 - then for our message we put in update
92:00 - search ui
92:01 - and we said no to everything else so
92:03 - this is our message so it creates a
92:05 - message for us
92:07 - depending on what answers we give to the
92:10 - questions
92:11 - so it's just a little additional thing
92:13 - that helps us make a nice uniform commit
92:16 - message
92:17 - all right michael says i'm out it's been
92:19 - fun hey uh see you later michael thanks
92:21 - for joining us
92:25 - so that's what we're doing if you want
92:26 - to know more about exactly what's going
92:28 - on behind the scenes i would check out
92:30 - the package json file let's see where
92:33 - that's at
92:34 - our package.json
92:36 - yeah so here's our package.json file and
92:39 - down here we have this cm
92:42 - and
92:43 - that does a get cz
92:49 - and we're using committed
92:53 - so check out committed
92:57 - and if you want to know more about how
92:59 - to do stuff like this and how to set
93:00 - this up
93:04 - and i believe there was
93:07 - a pull request for this so if you check
93:09 - through the pull request for this
93:10 - project on github you'll find one that
93:12 - has to do with this and there's probably
93:14 - some more info on on how to use it there
93:22 - oh carla says awesome thanks for
93:24 - explaining i always have a hard time
93:26 - thinking what to put in a commit
93:28 - uh
93:29 - with what i'm doing yeah me too for sure
93:31 - so this does help a bit it helps you
93:33 - kind of think through okay what am i
93:35 - what am i doing here
93:36 - so
93:38 - uh yeah it's definitely a really cool
93:39 - addition to the project
93:55 - oh cool carlos says awesome class had a
93:57 - great time learned a lot i'm glad i'm
93:58 - really glad um
94:00 - you know join us again if you can
94:02 - sometime i'd love to have you back
94:13 - java bat says would you recommend using
94:16 - react with es6 plus typescript
94:20 - i don't know that i can recommend it
94:21 - because i haven't really used it i've
94:23 - looked at other repos that use it
94:26 - i haven't in terms of typescript like
94:28 - es6 with react for sure for sure use es6
94:31 - with react it's
94:33 - it's a lot better
94:35 - if you take advantage of what's
94:36 - available in es6
94:39 - if you're not familiar with es6 it's
94:41 - kind of the newer things that are
94:42 - available to use with javascript
94:46 - sometimes called uh
94:47 - es2015 i believe es 2015 is is actually
94:51 - the the official name for it but
94:54 - most people say es6
94:56 - uh in terms of typescript though
95:00 - i don't i don't know enough
95:02 - i don't have enough uh experience
95:03 - working with it to really tell you if it
95:06 - would be better
95:07 - it would probably depend on your project
95:10 - honestly to to determine like how much
95:13 - benefit would you get out of it
95:16 - if anybody else uses typescript with
95:17 - react and can give a better answer that
95:20 - question uh please you know let us know
95:23 - in the chat
95:26 - uh bhuvana
95:28 - asks does this session go on every day
95:30 - um yeah er monday through friday i try
95:33 - to do a session every day i don't always
95:36 - get to do a session every day but that's
95:38 - my goal
95:42 - uh viral only says hi thanks for the
95:44 - session uh you're welcome thanks for
95:46 - watching
95:58 - uh john hanson says i just realized that
96:00 - by using the array function find it
96:02 - totally isn't supported at all in
96:04 - internet explorer
96:07 - good
96:08 - that's
96:11 - i'm of the opinion that we're not doing
96:13 - our users any favors by supporting
96:16 - outdated browsers especially browsers
96:18 - that are so outdated
96:20 - that it's security risk to the user
96:23 - we're enabling
96:25 - them
96:26 - to
96:27 - uh keep doing things that are bad for
96:30 - them right to keep doing these bad
96:33 - security practices they probably don't
96:35 - even know it
96:36 - but if more sites i mean this may be
96:39 - controversial but if more sites just
96:40 - wouldn't work for them at all
96:42 - maybe it would spur them to say hey
96:44 - something's wrong with my computer or my
96:46 - browser and actually learn more about it
96:48 - and update
96:51 - if we keep supporting all these old
96:52 - browsers
96:54 - then
96:56 - we're just enabling
96:58 - hackers or whoever to
97:00 - take advantage of people who know a
97:02 - little bit less about computers instead
97:03 - we should educate our users with a
97:06 - little message or something saying
97:07 - please update your browser for your
97:10 - security and for a better experience
97:13 - also i think we got to think about like
97:15 - what is the reason behind why we want to
97:17 - support these older browsers
97:19 - right
97:20 - mistakenly we may be thinking like oh we
97:22 - want to include everybody and we want
97:24 - everybody to be able to experience our
97:25 - site i mean that's a good thought but
97:28 - you know at the bottom of it at the root
97:30 - of it
97:33 - especially if we're one if we're selling
97:34 - something
97:36 - are we just supporting older browsers
97:38 - because we want the most number of
97:40 - people possibly able to buy our product
97:42 - or do something online no i'm not saying
97:44 - that's what everybody does but at some
97:46 - point somebody higher up is probably
97:47 - thinking that like more people coming to
97:50 - our site equals more money so we want as
97:52 - many people as possible without really
97:54 - thinking like
97:56 - okay but is that with what's best for
97:58 - the user
97:59 - so
98:01 - that's that's my reasoning i'm not
98:02 - trying to be mean by not supporting
98:04 - older browsers but my reasoning behind
98:06 - not supporting older browsers is
98:09 - genuinely being concerned that people
98:11 - have no idea
98:13 - what kind of danger they're putting
98:15 - their themselves and their computers in
98:17 - by using such outdated browsers when
98:19 - there are so many security safeguards in
98:22 - the newer versions
98:24 - anyway i know i've talked about that
98:26 - before in the stream so if you've heard
98:28 - me say that before sorry for repeating
98:30 - myself um but
98:33 - that's my view on it
98:35 - i will say this if you do it like that
98:37 - and you don't support browsers
98:39 - um it's it's probably good to have some
98:42 - sort of check for a browser and display
98:45 - some sort of message to let the user
98:46 - know what's going on
98:48 - if the site just breaks and doesn't work
98:50 - that's not a good user experience at
98:51 - least if you have a very polite
98:55 - message explaining the situation to the
98:57 - user then you are actually providing
98:59 - some help so
99:01 - we'll have to remember to put that in
99:02 - this project or else i'm going to sound
99:03 - like a big hypocrite so
99:06 - let's plan on doing that
99:08 - i have done it for some of my projects
99:10 - uh i admit i don't always remember to do
99:13 - that
99:14 - and sometimes i do end up supporting
99:16 - older browsers occasionally
99:20 - i i don't do it a lot sometimes i just
99:23 - do it
99:24 - kind of accidentally because build tools
99:26 - like a lot of build tools take care of
99:28 - that for you but anyway
99:33 - i'm going to move on
99:38 - noble and savage says i met someone
99:40 - today that uses ie there's a lot of
99:42 - people that use ie on campus here that i
99:45 - run into
99:47 - always amazed
99:50 - john anson says there's a lot of elderly
99:52 - people still using internet explorer
99:53 - eight yeah somebody on campus was using
99:55 - internet explorer eight and had a hard
99:57 - time trying to use some of the sites
99:59 - that i built
100:00 - and um
100:02 - finally realized that they were on
100:04 - internet explorer eight and that was the
100:05 - problem
100:15 - java bat says do you have something like
100:16 - a set of css classes which you are using
100:18 - as a basis for every project uh yes
100:21 - something like that so
100:23 - uh depending on what we're doing if
100:24 - we're doing a react project we're we're
100:27 - always using material ui
100:30 - which comes with its own set i mean it's
100:32 - it's like bootstrap or materialize but
100:34 - for react projects
100:37 - if we're doing a non-react project we
100:39 - use materialized css and then we also
100:42 - have
100:44 - some classes that we just kind of carry
100:46 - over
100:48 - to new projects we usually use sas
100:50 - and we have some sas variables for
100:52 - different colors and things
100:54 - that we carry over
100:55 - so we do have a style guide
100:59 - that really needs updated right now so i
101:01 - kind of don't even want to give you the
101:02 - address to it because it needs updated
101:04 - so badly
101:06 - but that also is the idea behind it
101:10 - is to include some css that you can
101:12 - reuse on on other projects
101:15 - and and make all the websites will have
101:17 - the same kind of like standard
101:20 - look and ui
101:21 - so that users
