00:00 - hey everybody welcome back to css3 in 30
00:03 - days today is day number 12 and we are
00:06 - going to be playing around with
00:07 - something called css variables there's
00:10 - also you can call it custom properties
00:13 - uh but that's not as exciting css
00:16 - variables especially for uh developers
00:19 - and designers out there who are familiar
00:21 - with variables in languages like php or
00:24 - jquery
00:25 - or even using css preprocessor languages
00:29 - like sas and less and scss where you use
00:33 - variables it really extends the
00:35 - functionality of css or whatever
00:39 - programming language you're using that
00:41 - are using the variables so in this case
00:43 - we're just going to be using plain
00:44 - vanilla css3 but you do have access to
00:47 - something called custom properties or
00:50 - aka css variables so jump over here in
00:54 - our browser we're just going to be
00:55 - coding a couple simple boxes nothing
00:58 - crazy but the neat thing about this
01:00 - everything we're doing here from the
01:02 - measurements to the colors are are used
01:05 - and created or styled rather via custom
01:09 - properties or css variables so why don't
01:12 - we just jump in and get started so here
01:15 - in my code editor i'm back with atom
01:18 - hopefully it behaves well
01:21 - we have day number 12 css variables go
01:23 - ahead and download that folder
01:26 - open it up in your code editor
01:28 - and then let's jump right back in
01:30 - here in the index you're just going to
01:31 - see the usual
01:33 - that we've been using these past 12 days
01:37 - and just down here you're gonna see in
01:40 - the section just two divs one with the
01:42 - class of box and one with the class of
01:44 - box
01:45 - box two
01:47 - and of course you can go down to the
01:48 - final result and check out uh how that's
01:51 - coded up in the final css there are a
01:54 - lot of comments and notes in here to
01:56 - help you understand why we are doing
01:58 - certain things explaining the custom
02:01 - properties and everything like that but
02:03 - what we're going to concern ourselves
02:05 - with is this file sandbox.css as usual
02:08 - and we're going to get
02:10 - started
02:11 - let's start off by
02:13 - selecting the sandbox class and within
02:16 - there what we're going to do
02:18 - is declare
02:20 - three different variables or custom
02:22 - properties
02:23 - and the way this works with custom
02:25 - properties in css
02:27 - is the when you define that specific
02:30 - custom property within a selector it is
02:33 - its scope is that selector so if you
02:35 - wanted the
02:37 - these variables to be accessible across
02:39 - the entire website and all styles you
02:41 - would use a selector
02:43 - like
02:44 - body
02:46 - or something like
02:49 - root is another selector the root
02:51 - element of a tree representing the
02:53 - document you can use those selectors if
02:54 - you want these specific
02:56 - variables to be accessible throughout
02:58 - the entire document something like a
03:00 - color or a font size or maybe branding
03:03 - specifically branding colors but we're
03:06 - just going to use
03:07 - in this case sandbox so all of the
03:10 - variables are
03:12 - its scope is this selector so the
03:15 - variables won't work if i am trying to
03:18 - use those variables on
03:20 - elements outside of sandbox
03:23 - so this is how you start a selector
03:26 - sorry this is how you start a variable
03:29 - you start out with two dashes and then
03:32 - you name the variable so i'm going to
03:34 - say primary dash color
03:37 - and i'm going to say orange red
03:40 - another variable here
03:42 - i'm going to say secondary
03:44 - color dash color that is
03:46 - hot pink
03:48 - and then double dash base dash
03:51 - measurement
03:52 - 20 pixels so three variables it's not
03:55 - going to do anything if i save this and
03:57 - check it out in the browser it's not
03:58 - going to actually do anything because
03:59 - those aren't actual styles they're just
04:01 - variables now let's go back down here
04:04 - and let's access the variable
04:06 - like so so i'm going to select
04:09 - the sandbox
04:11 - and then
04:12 - box so these are both of the boxes
04:15 - and let's just first of all
04:17 - text align center
04:20 - and now what we're going to do
04:21 - is let's actually add one more variable
04:23 - within sandbox box so now this variable
04:26 - is only accessible within this
04:28 - particular scope within box within
04:31 - sandbox so you can't actually use it
04:33 - outside of this selector
04:36 - or these elements rather
04:38 - so i'm going to say double dash
04:41 - text color it's going to be f3
04:44 - f3 f3
04:47 - okay
04:49 - now here's how we access
04:52 - the variable so i'm going to say
04:55 - color
04:57 - and we have to open it up with var
05:00 - and then opening and closing parentheses
05:02 - and then a semicolon of course and then
05:04 - all you do here is just call the name of
05:07 - the variable that you
05:09 - created
05:10 - double dash
05:12 - and text color text dash color now
05:16 - if i
05:18 - save that and then go over to the
05:19 - browser you're going to see that you
05:21 - cannot see the text and that's because
05:24 - it is the same color as the background
05:25 - in this case or pretty close
05:28 - and it's centered
05:30 - so we know that that variable is working
05:32 - let's continue
05:34 - and style the background and we're going
05:36 - to say var open closing variable or var
05:40 - double dash primary dash color and let's
05:44 - go ahead and say margin
05:46 - and whoops there we go
05:50 - and i'm going to say var
05:53 - this one's going to be base dash
05:55 - measurement which as we know is 20
05:57 - pixels so go ahead and save that check
05:59 - it out in the browser now it's doing
06:01 - something the background is that primary
06:03 - color which is orange red and the base
06:05 - measurement is of margin is 20 pixels it
06:08 - is working so this is nice
06:11 - so now one other cool thing that you can
06:13 - do
06:14 - with the
06:15 - measurements is you can actually do math
06:18 - by using the calc function so let me
06:20 - show you how to do that height
06:24 - we're going to say var
06:27 - and then base measurement das dash
06:30 - measurement but we don't want to just
06:33 - leave it there let's wrap this in calc
06:38 - and then semicolon and we're going to
06:40 - calculate this but then we actually have
06:42 - to perform a calculation so outside of
06:44 - this
06:45 - so this is the first argument here and
06:47 - there's one more
06:48 - times we're going to say times 10 so
06:50 - we're going to calculate the var base
06:52 - measurement or the base measurement
06:54 - times 10
06:55 - and that should equal excuse me 200
06:58 - pixels
06:59 - and then i'm going to copy that paste it
07:01 - i'm going to change this to width i want
07:02 - it to be the same because it is a box
07:05 - and then i want the line height
07:07 - to in fact be the same as well
07:10 - now if i save that i should have perfect
07:12 - boxes head over to the browser there we
07:14 - go all using the variables and the css
07:17 - here let's check it out
07:19 - what shows up so we've got box and then
07:22 - if we look at the styles
07:27 - it actually is showing up as var text
07:29 - color primary color measurement it's
07:31 - actually
07:33 - showing those variables it's not showing
07:34 - the final calculated number in there at
07:36 - least in this developer tools there and
07:38 - so i find that pretty interesting um
07:41 - now let's do let's go back to our code
07:42 - editor and we're gonna do one final
07:44 - thing here if you scroll down
07:47 - beyond that
07:50 - we're gonna say
07:52 - sandbox
07:54 - and then box two we wanna make that
07:56 - color of box 2 different background
07:58 - we've already set up a variable for it
08:01 - var double dash secondary
08:03 - dash color save that in the browser
08:06 - we've got our orange red box number one
08:08 - and our hot pink box number two the
08:10 - colors and the measurements
08:12 - are calculated and created using
08:15 - custom
08:17 - properties also known as css variables
08:20 - that is exciting i hope that shed some
08:23 - light and some insight on some cool
08:25 - things that you could do with css
08:26 - variables instead of having to go in and
08:29 - create uh you know install preprocessors
08:31 - and different uh css languages like sas
08:33 - and less for certain projects that might
08:35 - not be that necessary or too much uh
08:38 - work maybe just a simple landing page
08:40 - and you just want to get something up
08:41 - quickly you can use css variables make
08:45 - sure you check at the bottom of this
08:46 - page here you can see
08:49 - the css3 styles how compatible they are
08:52 - with major browsers if you click that
08:54 - it'll take you to
08:55 - a page called can i use and then you can
08:58 - type in something like
09:02 - css variables custom properties it
09:05 - permits the declaration and usage of
09:06 - cascading variables and style sheets
09:09 - and you can see here how compatible they
09:11 - are so with ie11 it's not supported uh
09:15 - oh well
09:17 - and edge
09:19 - it looks like it's partial support and
09:21 - full support here on 16 firefox fully
09:23 - supported chrome fully supported safari
09:25 - opera ios safari fully supported opera
09:28 - mini not so much android 56 yes uh 4.4
09:32 - no
09:33 - and chrome for android so we're pretty
09:35 - darn
09:37 - um
09:38 - covered here so that's pretty neat uh
09:41 - you can see up here the percentage here
09:42 - so the global percentage is about 77.9
09:45 - percent um
09:48 - compatible so you can rest assured that
09:50 - you're pretty safe using css variables
09:53 - also known as custom properties i hope
09:55 - this lesson was exciting for you and
09:57 - gave you some ideas
09:59 - and quick hot tip if you want to get
10:01 - access to all of these 30 lessons all at
