00:01 - hi in this video we are going to be
00:02 - talking about chips and something called
00:05 - Moors law you've probably noticed over
00:07 - the past 10 or so years that if you're
00:09 - going to go buy an MP3 player you can
00:11 - get a lot more storage for a lot less
00:14 - price and you probably have even done
00:16 - the thing where you're at the store and
00:17 - you're like well I could get one now or
00:19 - I could wait six months and the price is
00:21 - going to be in half which might sound
00:23 - ridiculous but this is actually a trend
00:25 - that's been happening for a long time
00:29 - let's talk about what makes a chip now a
00:31 - chip is just full of these little things
00:33 - called transistors which are switches
00:36 - that can either be a one or a zero it's
00:38 - a common theme you've heard a lot about
00:39 - right so all these little transistors
00:41 - fit onto a chip and that's how it holds
00:44 - information it's stored in ones and
00:46 - zeros what makes these faster is the
00:48 - amount of transistors the transistors
00:51 - mean one or zero they're little switches
00:53 - that can hold just a one or a zero in
00:55 - their information and the amount of
00:57 - transistors they can fit doubles every
00:59 - two years since
01:01 - 1965 now what's most important about
01:03 - Moore's Law is that it's making
01:05 - technology more accessible and more
01:07 - affordable to everyone
