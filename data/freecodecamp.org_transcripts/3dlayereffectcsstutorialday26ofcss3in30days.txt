00:00 - hey everybody welcome back to css3 in 30
00:02 - days today's day number 26 and we're
00:04 - going to be building something really
00:05 - exciting but first of all you might
00:07 - notice that my microphone is in a really
00:08 - weird
00:09 - position
00:10 - i realize with this road extendable boom
00:13 - arm
00:15 - that you can mount to your desk it's
00:16 - really versatile it's quite nice
00:19 - uh but this whole time i've been hanging
00:21 - it
00:22 - in front of my face which means i can't
00:23 - actually see my screen that well which
00:25 - makes it a little bit difficult to
00:26 - record coding tutorials so i maneuvered
00:30 - it in this really unusual awkward
00:32 - looking position
00:37 - and i thought hey i'll give it a try for
00:39 - this round so here we go
00:41 - over here in my browser
00:44 - still adjusting this thing
00:47 - not going to promise we're keeping it
00:48 - this way folks
00:49 - all right
00:51 - we have got the day 26 3d layers and
00:54 - what am i talking about when i say 3d
00:55 - layers well
00:56 - let me show you here to you right now
00:58 - this might look like a just like a
01:00 - normal
01:02 - the normal mock-up
01:04 - but the fact is that i created it in
01:05 - photoshop using
01:07 - svg
01:08 - format which means it's a vector format
01:10 - which means it's infinitely scalable and
01:12 - super sharp regardless of your screen
01:13 - size
01:14 - and if you make it bigger or smaller so
01:16 - i created this mock-up i included the
01:18 - photoshop document in the image folder
01:20 - as well so maybe you might want to see
01:22 - and play around with it
01:24 - but this is what happens when i hover
01:26 - over this mock-up watch this
01:31 - that's super cool so you might already
01:34 - think that's amazing i want to know how
01:36 - to make that or you might think i have
01:37 - some ideas on how i want to use that
01:39 - essentially the reason why we're doing
01:41 - this is one it's a really big challenge
01:43 - that we're doing a lot of really
01:44 - interesting maneuvering using uh
01:46 - different
01:48 - different planes the x y and z planes
01:49 - using transitions transforms and
01:51 - animations and all that sort of thing so
01:53 - it's a challenging little task it's a
01:55 - super impressive way to display almost
01:57 - anything in a showcase format on your
02:00 - website so a mock-up a blueprint a
02:03 - wireframe even images or you know
02:06 - different elements it's really exciting
02:08 - now i wouldn't use it as a functional
02:10 - piece like for navigating or something
02:12 - like that
02:13 - but to display something in an
02:14 - impressive manner to show the layers of
02:16 - your work or something like that this is
02:19 - the way to do it
02:20 - now
02:21 - let's look at it one more time
02:23 - show you what's happening so we have a
02:24 - back layer here
02:26 - and then we have a middle layer right
02:28 - here
02:30 - a top layer these three these six
02:32 - circles
02:33 - and this text down here this uh
02:37 - mock-up text wireframe text just a bunch
02:39 - of lines that mimics text
02:41 - and then we have the
02:43 - uh these two icons here on the tippy top
02:46 - i call it and so in one
02:49 - layer just looking at it straight it
02:50 - looks like a normal mock-up but when you
02:52 - hover over it it
02:54 - extends out and shifts it changes and
02:57 - it's using a 3d transformation in css3
03:00 - so why don't we jump in and get started
03:03 - over here in the code editor we have the
03:06 - day 26 3d layers i have all of the
03:09 - assets there index sandbox vinyl and the
03:11 - image folder which includes
03:13 - svg files which are not image files
03:15 - technically they're actually sdg files
03:17 - which stands for scalable vector graphic
03:20 - so it's not an image but you can add it
03:22 - to your websites and web pages using the
03:25 - image tag so it it sees it as an image
03:28 - but the file actually isn't a technical
03:30 - true image
03:32 - and then i have the layers.psd there if
03:34 - you want to open it up in photoshop and
03:35 - check it out play around with it and do
03:37 - whatever so here's the markup right here
03:39 - in a div with the class of layers i have
03:42 - four image tags in there there they are
03:45 - commented out because
03:46 - you will see once i uncomment it it
03:48 - creates a really uh there's the really
03:50 - large
03:51 - vector graphics that take up most of the
03:54 - page you have to scroll down so for
03:56 - visualization purposes showing you the
03:58 - demo i didn't want you to see that so
03:59 - now go ahead and uncomment that
04:02 - and then you will have your
04:04 - four images
04:06 - scalable vector graphics now if you
04:07 - check it on the browser it's going to
04:09 - look really bad
04:10 - massive files like this but we're going
04:13 - to be using this and manipulating these
04:15 - in css to make them work okay so now
04:18 - that we've got those svg images svg
04:21 - graphics in there what we're going to do
04:23 - is head over to our sandbox and we're
04:24 - going to get started with our coding
04:27 - adventure for this 3d layer effect let's
04:29 - start off by selecting layers
04:31 - and then we're going to tell it position
04:35 - relative
04:37 - a minimum height
04:38 - of now it's going to be a specific
04:40 - number i'm going to say 6 640
04:42 - pixels
04:43 - and that's simply because the vector
04:46 - graphic here if i were to open it
04:49 - you can see here the width and the
04:50 - height
04:51 - are this
04:52 - by default that's really large so i'm
04:54 - going to scale that down to
04:56 - about one-third of the size now it's a
04:59 - rough calculation but i basically took
05:00 - these and divided them by three and
05:02 - that's essentially the numbers we're
05:03 - using i rounded it up a little bit just
05:05 - so that they were easy numbers
05:07 - to calculate
05:09 - max width is going to be 360. so now
05:11 - we're going to have the proper ratio in
05:13 - this parent layer and now next what
05:15 - we're going to do is we're going to say
05:16 - layers and then select the image tags
05:18 - we're going to say position absolute
05:20 - because we're going to be moving them
05:21 - all around max width is going to be 100
05:24 - so it's going to it's going to fill out
05:27 - the content the parent the parent
05:29 - container and now we're going to say
05:30 - height is 100
05:32 - it's going to fill out that parent
05:33 - container
05:34 - uh
05:36 - height wise as well lengthwise
05:39 - vertical wise whatever
05:42 - transition we're gonna say all e's
05:44 - sixteen hundred milliseconds
05:47 - and that's important because we're going
05:48 - to be doing a transition to give us that
05:50 - animated effect now we're going to say
05:52 - transform
05:54 - style and we're going to say preserve 3d
05:57 - because we're going to have the
05:59 - transform we're going to do some uh
06:01 - transforming and some
06:03 - shifting and perspective you know 3d
06:07 - animations and
06:08 - maneuvering and this preserves that 3d
06:12 - plane because we want it to actually
06:13 - look three-dimensional not like it's
06:15 - skewed
06:17 - so preserve 3d
06:19 - so we're going to save that and now if
06:22 - you check it out in your browser you'll
06:23 - see that now we have a more reasonable
06:24 - size problem here is that all the layers
06:27 - are all messed up and that's because all
06:29 - these svg graphics are the same width
06:31 - and same height and svg graphics don't
06:33 - really perform the same way as a png
06:37 - bitmap graphic for example which only
06:39 - takes up the size of space so for
06:41 - example this as a png would only take up
06:44 - this much space but it actually
06:46 - is taking up this much space the entire
06:48 - container because of the height
06:51 - uh and it's just it's a thing that you
06:52 - have to work with with svg files it's
06:54 - kind of unusual maybe there's a way
06:56 - around it i'm not entirely experienced
06:58 - with playing with svgs
07:00 - but for this purposes of this tutorial
07:02 - this is how we're gonna do it
07:04 - so now we gotta maneuver all these
07:05 - things using positions quite easy but it
07:07 - takes a little bit of it took me a
07:09 - little bit of playing around and
07:11 - maneuvering it using uh pixels and
07:13 - everything like that uh but i finally
07:15 - came to some final numbers so let's type
07:18 - those in right now
07:19 - so what we're going to do
07:21 - is say layers
07:23 - image of the class of mid
07:25 - because that we have each of the layers
07:27 - the images with the class of back mid
07:30 - top and tippy top so we can do this with
07:32 - them i'm going to say the width of the
07:35 - mid layer which is the
07:36 - not the background layer but the one
07:38 - just in front of it
07:40 - is 320 pixels and that's because we have
07:44 - a max width of 360. so it's the
07:46 - background is 360. i want this next one
07:48 - to be 320 and then i'm going to shift it
07:50 - over this allows me to do some
07:52 - mock margins so to speak
07:54 - so we're going to say
07:56 - 320 which will look something like this
07:58 - you can see now it's smaller in the
08:00 - background right here now i'm going to
08:02 - shift it over 20 pixels
08:04 - so that should give us an exact 20 and
08:06 - 20 on either side because it's apparent
08:08 - just 360. so 320 plus 40 is 360.
08:13 - so basic math
08:14 - now we're going to say layers image of
08:16 - the class of top
08:18 - and we're going to give that one a width
08:19 - of 300 pixels
08:21 - so now i'm taking off
08:23 - 20 pixels
08:25 - in total
08:27 - from that
08:29 - from the top layer which is this one
08:30 - here as you can see this one with the
08:32 - logo and then the navigation so now i
08:34 - want to shift that in
08:36 - about
08:38 - 30 pixels because it's going to be 10
08:40 - pixels on either side as you can see
08:41 - here that's looking a little bit better
08:44 - but the top is off i don't like how the
08:46 - top looks so now i'm going to say top if
08:48 - i said 0
08:51 - it would look like this that's because
08:53 - the top is at zero but i want to move it
08:55 - up just about five pixels so top
08:57 - negative five pixels and that looks like
09:00 - that that looks much better now we have
09:01 - this tippy top layer which are these uh
09:03 - this film reel and the bicycle
09:06 - layers
09:07 - image and then tippy is what i called it
09:10 - with 280 pixels so i'm taking off
09:12 - another 20 pixels
09:15 - i'm gonna say left 40 pixels
09:20 - and that'll look a little bit better
09:22 - uh but now i want to say top and i want
09:24 - to bring it up negative 150 pixels that
09:27 - should bring me up to where i want it so
09:29 - now our mock-up is looking much more
09:31 - reasonable
09:32 - now what we have to do is
09:34 - play with it so this is the fun part
09:37 - so
09:38 - we're going to create a style rule that
09:42 - says layers
09:43 - upon hover
09:45 - the images so we're going to start off
09:47 - with transform
09:50 - now what i'm going to do is i'm going to
09:51 - take hover off for now because i want to
09:53 - see it while i'm deving versus
09:56 - having to hover over every single time
09:58 - to see my work so i'm just going to say
09:59 - layers image for now
10:03 - now
10:04 - this is where all the fun comes in
10:05 - there's a lot of different values and
10:08 - functions actually you can add to the
10:10 - transform property so by function i
10:12 - literally mean something like using
10:14 - rotate x this is a css function
10:18 - uh as a as a value for this
10:21 - property
10:22 - so rotate x this will rotate the image
10:25 - or all the images on the x plane so i
10:28 - want to rotate it 50 degrees feel free
10:30 - to play around with this in all the ways
10:31 - that you want but you can see here now
10:33 - that something weird has happened
10:36 - um
10:37 - it's shifted
10:39 - on an angle like if you're looking at
10:40 - something it's shifted
10:42 - like this
10:43 - and so that's what happened here now it
10:44 - doesn't look 3d because
10:47 - there is one function that we have to
10:48 - add but i want to add it at the end so
10:50 - you can see the dramatic change
10:53 - so now i want to rotate
10:54 - on the y plane
10:57 - 20 degrees let's see what happens there
11:00 - we go so now we've
11:01 - the y plane is this one so the x plane
11:03 - is this one the y plane is this one
11:08 - and now we're going to say rotate
11:10 - on the z plane
11:12 - negative 25 degrees let's see what
11:14 - happens
11:15 - okay so now we've shifted it
11:18 - on this unusual angle
11:21 - as if it's coming
11:22 - if it's going back this way and towards
11:24 - us this way so on this like um
11:28 - z plane i suppose if you play around
11:30 - with it you'll start to see how it's
11:32 - moving in digital space
11:34 - now like i said this doesn't look
11:37 - right
11:38 - it doesn't look very three-dimensional
11:40 - versus this down here you can see that
11:42 - looks very three-dimensional like it's
11:44 - coming off your screen and towards you
11:46 - well that's because we need to add
11:48 - an additional function in here called
11:50 - perspective
11:52 - now the perspective
11:53 - property or function
11:55 - in this case
11:57 - creates or enables 3d
11:59 - space
12:01 - on your screen and produces this
12:03 - illusion of a distance between the z
12:06 - plane and myself the person viewing the
12:08 - screen
12:09 - so
12:10 - now what's going to happen
12:12 - is if i say perspective and then
12:15 - let's go 1000 pixels now what's going to
12:18 - happen here i'll tell explain how this
12:20 - value the numeric value works but let's
12:21 - see what it looks like first
12:23 - so now
12:24 - it looks three-dimensional it actually
12:26 - has the proper
12:28 - the proper shape the back looks smaller
12:30 - than the front it's it looks like it's
12:31 - coming towards us a little bit
12:33 - what if i change this to like 600.
12:36 - now you can see he's way more
12:38 - um exaggerated that three-dimensional
12:41 - effect
12:42 - so the smaller this value the more
12:45 - exaggerated effect because that's that
12:47 - means that you are closer to this
12:50 - element on the z-plane so you're looking
12:51 - at something closer as if i were looking
12:53 - at my phone like this
12:55 - the back side looks smaller than the
12:57 - front side it's got this dramatic effect
12:59 - whereas if i was like this
13:01 - further away
13:03 - it's much less exaggerated versus
13:06 - that so hopefully that makes sense
13:09 - okay so i'm going to go back to i'm
13:11 - going to say 1200 so it's it's there
13:13 - it's it's 3d but it's not crazy
13:16 - exaggerated now as you can see it's way
13:18 - down here
13:19 - it's not in the right space it looks
13:20 - kind of sloppy especially if i hovered
13:22 - it it would fall down the page would
13:24 - look really weird so we're going to
13:26 - remedy that with translate so we're
13:28 - going to translate on the x
13:31 - axis 35 pixels this is simply like doing
13:34 - uh positioning but in 3d space
13:37 - so translate 35 pixels that's going to
13:39 - move it to the left
13:41 - translate
13:44 - on the y-axis
13:46 - and we're going to say zero pixels we
13:48 - don't want it that's up and down
13:50 - and then translate on the z axis
13:54 - and that will bring us back up to the
13:57 - space where i want it so now we're
14:00 - looking a lot better so if i were to say
14:01 - layers
14:02 - hover now layers hover image save that
14:05 - let's see what that looks like i hover
14:07 - it shifts
14:08 - and transitions there it looks pretty
14:11 - good and that's because we did the
14:12 - transition
14:14 - property up here if i were to take that
14:16 - out
14:17 - this would be a lot less nice
14:20 - as you can see
14:22 - it's that transition that shows us we're
14:24 - going into three-dimensional space
14:26 - so
14:28 - now what i want to do is position these
14:31 - in the proper i want them to to expand
14:34 - out i want it to like give us that well
14:36 - that effect down here
14:38 - where it all kind of layers out that's
14:40 - nice so we want to do that so we're
14:42 - going to achieve that by individually
14:44 - styling each image or each layer so i'm
14:47 - going to say layers hover
14:50 - image of the class of mid
14:52 - and i'm going to go ahead and copy this
14:54 - entire thing
14:55 - paste it
14:56 - and change a couple of the values now i
14:59 - can i probably could take out the values
15:01 - that i don't need like maybe if i just
15:02 - took out all of these
15:04 - and left translate z
15:06 - translate zed
15:08 - for us canadians
15:10 - and i'm going to change that to 240
15:12 - pixels let's see if just having one
15:14 - value there works
15:17 - it doesn't the reason why is because now
15:19 - i'm saying that transform is not present
15:22 - for all the other x y and z planes so i
15:25 - have to leave it in
15:27 - all of these values
15:29 - translate z i'm going to change back to
15:31 - 240
15:33 - check it out when i hover
15:35 - you see that layer is now lifted off of
15:37 - the
15:38 - background copy this now the rest is
15:41 - super easy paste that whole thing out
15:43 - image
15:44 - top
15:45 - we're going to change the value of the
15:47 - last one to 80. so that's going to be
15:49 - 280 pixels further on the z plane and
15:52 - i'm going to refresh and hover
15:54 - now we've got our second layer
15:57 - like that
15:58 - last but not least copy that
16:01 - paste it out and now we're going to do
16:02 - the tipi class
16:05 - and that translate z
16:06 - it's going to be as you can see in here
16:08 - it's unusual the way that this floats in
16:11 - space is because it's a different
16:13 - proportions than these other elements so
16:15 - we have to use different values to move
16:18 - it in the right uh in the right place
16:21 - so you might think 240 280 this one's
16:23 - obviously going to be 320 but that would
16:26 - really mess things up as you'll see here
16:29 - it's just really too far and so there's
16:32 - something about the size of this svg
16:34 - that just means we have to change that
16:36 - value so it's actually 260. i'm not
16:39 - entirely sure why if i really looked
16:41 - into it i'd figure it out
16:42 - and maybe you have an idea but
16:44 - this gives us the right effect
16:47 - so now they're all about the same
16:49 - distance from each other in that in
16:52 - space in 3d space
16:54 - and really that is it for our 3d layer
16:58 - effect now here's a challenge for you
17:00 - feel free to
17:02 - maneuver this in whatever way you want
17:05 - the thing is these this is a little bit
17:07 - tricky and finicky if you're looking for
17:08 - a responsive effect right now i've
17:10 - hard-coded the width so that we don't
17:12 - really have uh any issues but even in
17:15 - the background here the background is a
17:16 - 100
17:17 - you could see things are looking a
17:19 - little bit different here
17:21 - the other thing is when you hover
17:23 - over this
17:24 - layer these layers come out and then
17:26 - hover again at any point in that
17:28 - transition it it does like a weird as
17:31 - you could see like it kind of
17:33 - starts the animation from where you
17:35 - clicked on it or where you hovered so it
17:36 - really messes with it and it's really
17:38 - unusual so you'd have to do this in the
17:40 - right controlled space and uh really
17:43 - play around with it to make sure you're
17:44 - doing the right thing so you don't have
17:45 - a really wonky looking animation
17:48 - this is really for demo purposes to show
17:50 - you what you can do with 3d space
17:52 - rotates translates transforms and
17:54 - everything like that i hope today's
17:56 - lesson was valuable educational and fun
