00:03 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:07 - with Jesse and I'm Jesse and my beard
00:12 - decided not to stream with us today oh I
00:18 - have a face I forgot what it looked like
00:25 - anyway today we're gonna do something
00:27 - that is very new to me and that's unit
00:30 - testing so if you've seen a lot of the
00:34 - streams then you'll probably remember me
00:39 - admitting this several times and being
00:41 - called out for it that we do have
00:44 - testing setup
00:45 - I just don't write the testing oh no
00:48 - noble noble and Savage is gone now they
00:54 - were only here for the beard I guess
00:56 - oh whoa my co-workers thought I should
00:59 - just shave half a beard that would have
01:03 - been the best of both worlds I guess
01:05 - maybe I'll try it let's try it next time
01:07 - it shouldn't take me too long to grow a
01:09 - beard again that's probably a month and
01:12 - I can get it nice and bushy again but my
01:16 - wife's really happy about it so she'll
01:21 - be happy I just hope my kids recognize
01:23 - me sometimes the little ones like they
01:26 - freaked out a bit if I shave my beard so
01:30 - we'll see you later on when I go home
01:34 - see I was gonna say something was I
01:37 - gonna say oh I have a lot of updates so
01:42 - I've been working on the site so I
01:44 - didn't stream the last two days I work
01:46 - from home the last two days and to be
01:47 - entirely honest with you I was feeling
01:49 - pretty depressed I haven't worked out in
01:51 - a while
01:52 - and I I just was feeling depressed and
01:57 - when it like that it's really hard
01:58 - anybody has depression you know it's
02:00 - really hard to interact with people and
02:03 - do things so I would just think like
02:05 - okay what am I gonna do what am I gonna
02:07 - stream about today and I just couldn't
02:09 - think of a topic to stream about
02:12 - and the time just ticked by and I didn't
02:16 - I didn't do it so today I had to come in
02:19 - for meetings I got a haircut so like it
02:22 - was I did things today that helped me to
02:24 - feel better and so anyway I apologize
02:30 - for not streaming I I could have found
02:35 - time to stream but anyway hopefully I
02:39 - get back on my workout routine and kind
02:45 - of get back to normal with things
02:46 - tomorrow I think I'm going to do a
02:48 - stream but it's not going to be about
02:50 - this project
02:51 - tomorrow will be we're gonna work on so
02:56 - Alex Castillo and I are gonna work on a
02:59 - brain-computer interface with JavaScript
03:03 - so we're still trying to get the headset
03:08 - that I purchased working so we're
03:13 - working on like that connection with how
03:14 - to take get the data from Bluetooth and
03:19 - get it into a format that we can use you
03:25 - know Java scripts to do things with
03:27 - basically so we'll see hope hopefully
03:31 - that'll go well I haven't decided
03:32 - whether I'll strain that on my channel
03:35 - or on free code camps channel if you're
03:38 - interested in that please subscribe to
03:41 - my channel the links down below just so
03:42 - you don't miss it I haven't really
03:46 - talked to Quincy about whether or not
03:47 - it's cool if I do that on free code
03:50 - camps channel so we'll see I'm sure he'd
03:52 - be ok with it
03:54 - all right but enough talk let's get to
03:57 - the code and I haven't taken my G fuel
04:00 - yet so I accept GQ and coffee so I'm
04:03 - gonna be switching off as always G fuel
04:08 - I'm open to a sponsorship deal and I
04:12 - mean you need to get on this there's 28
04:14 - viewers you know G fuel you're missing
04:15 - out and also
04:20 - my Elle Fanning which is supposed to
04:25 - help with brain function and stuff like
04:27 - that so now that I've properly enhanced
04:34 - my brain with these things let's get
04:36 - started yeah Nikki the beard is gone
04:41 - yeah I do want to say what's up to
04:43 - everybody in the chat I see a lot of you
04:44 - are saying hello
04:47 - no boom seven says I can see why your
04:50 - wife snagged you though
04:52 - I always appreciate your comments that
04:56 - they're always very entertaining one
05:01 - question I do want to address so
05:03 - Siberian says do I have to watch the
05:05 - other projects to be able to follow
05:06 - along with this one no you do not so the
05:11 - projects are but you don't have to watch
05:16 - one project or the other so I try to do
05:18 - a good job of starting from scratch each
05:19 - time and yeah and actually the first
05:26 - projects may not be the best to watch
05:28 - anyway because they'll be some of the
05:31 - stuff's outdated you know they've come
05:33 - out with new versions of the things that
05:35 - we used so I don't want to say they're
05:39 - entirely useless because we do cover a
05:40 - lot of things that are pretty standard
05:42 - and don't change but if you had to pick
05:45 - to watch something I'd say watch the
05:47 - newer whatever the latest project we're
05:49 - working on it probably the best to be
05:51 - able to get you know the information
05:54 - that you could use immediately to help
05:55 - you in your projects
06:02 - Ryan says add row' I don't have a dural
06:06 - I've never tried at a row I've heard
06:09 - things about it but I've never so okay I
06:15 - did want to show you all that I made a
06:18 - playlist for this project and I know a
06:21 - lot of you have been requesting this for
06:23 - a long time
06:24 - and I haven't done it is just pure
06:27 - procrastination I could have made time
06:29 - to do it just wasn't a priority for me
06:32 - so I finally did it
06:33 - so now you can see all of project 5
06:37 - videos and I put it so that project the
06:40 - day one shows up first and it goes in
06:43 - order like that I think this will help
06:45 - for new people who want to watch them in
06:47 - order so for those who have already seen
06:51 - them and want to see the latest one
06:52 - it'll be a little odd because you have
06:54 - to scroll down but the latest one comes
06:56 - up like on the front page of free code
06:59 - camp anyway so it should be too hard to
07:04 - see that so anyway this is now on the
07:07 - playlist I'm still gonna keep that long
07:09 - playlist that has all the live coding
07:11 - with Jessie stuff in there just people
07:14 - are probably used to that I'm sure some
07:17 - people you know have saved that playlist
07:21 - so anyway I have it set up that it so
07:24 - that it should automatically add the
07:26 - videos to this playlist every time I do
07:28 - a new video so but we won't forget
07:33 - anything everything should be there so
07:35 - I'm gonna see after I do this video if
07:38 - this stream that we're doing now
07:39 - automatically goes there not hopefully
07:42 - it does but that's one project I think I
07:45 - have a playlist for project four and I
07:49 - want to get the other project soon so
07:53 - everything will have a separate playlist
07:54 - and we already have this is will be
07:58 - video 51 for this project this is insane
08:02 - a lot of videos
08:06 - Nikki sy no YouTube dark theme for for
08:11 - this YouTube thing I'm on the free code
08:13 - camp account and I keep it with the
08:18 - light theme I don't remember why I
08:20 - didn't there was some reason why I kept
08:24 - it with the light today maybe so I just
08:25 - tell it apart because and so this is in
08:29 - chrome and Chrome Canary I'm logged into
08:31 - my own YouTube account and that is on
08:34 - the dark
08:34 - so it does help me because I don't want
08:37 - to accidentally like reply to comments
08:39 - as free code camp and stuff like that so
08:43 - helps me keep it straight but I'm gonna
08:47 - close that since we don't need that
08:50 - anymore and see let's go
08:57 - brian says add row' helps him a lot I
09:02 - now let me know if I'm wrong on this but
09:06 - you normally can't get a duro unless
09:08 - it's prescribed for something correct I
09:11 - can't legally like I can't just get out
09:14 - at all to say like hey I want to you
09:15 - know stay up and do a lot of coding
09:17 - right I my pharmacist wouldn't be cool
09:21 - with that it's unit testing that's right
09:32 - oh you know what before we do that let
09:34 - me make sure I start up and grow up and
09:36 - give you all the link so we won't
09:42 - necessarily be doing that much with it
09:47 - in terms of like any front-end stuff
09:50 - actually changing but you could maybe
09:52 - see some of the changes that I've done
09:54 - on the site and you know mess around
09:56 - with a site on your own someone that's
10:02 - why are we talking about
10:03 - adderall uh-huh
10:07 - it just got brought up so anyway yeah so
10:15 - I don't brian says you have to have a TD
10:17 - or ADHD I don't have either one of those
10:19 - so I guess adderall is not for me
10:30 - I'm really sorry I'm having trouble with
10:33 - this name but presume is law I'm sorry
10:37 - let me know how that's pronounced
10:39 - because I'd really like to get it right
10:40 - but anyway they asked have you ever used
10:43 - docker for your projects I tried using
10:45 - docker oh maybe at least a year ago
10:49 - maybe maybe almost two years ago and I
10:55 - started to work with it and then I had
10:57 - some projects come up that were like
10:59 - tight deadlines and so I I just kind of
11:04 - set it aside because I wasn't good
11:05 - enough with it yet that I could do this
11:08 - project and I never picked it back up
11:10 - I'd really like to learn more about
11:11 - docker and use it but at this point my
11:14 - doctor skills are not good enough for me
11:17 - to you know work with on a you know real
11:20 - project ok so let me give a very quick
11:27 - summary of what I did what I've done in
11:29 - the last few days you can always go to
11:31 - the github repo links in the description
11:33 - and check out the last few commits to
11:35 - see what I've done inside the matrix as
11:40 - your vs code as an update autumn
11:44 - alright cool I'm not gonna run the
11:46 - update right now just you know for time
11:49 - reasons I mean usually they're really
11:51 - fast but I just I just kind of want to
11:52 - get started but thank you for letting me
11:56 - know I will run that update maybe later
12:02 - okay so I've added this Travis fought
12:10 - what was a gamble that's how you say
12:14 - ready for YAML files the mo file anyway
12:16 - I've added this in here if you're not
12:20 - familiar with Travis look up Travis CI
12:22 - it's for continuous integration
12:25 - basically it links in with sorry it
12:33 - leaks I got distracted reading the live
12:35 - chat it links in with github so that
12:38 - every time we push code to github it
12:40 - runs
12:42 - before that that commit actually like
12:47 - goes through so it's kind of another
12:51 - layer of checking right because you know
12:56 - potentially it wants I'm really the only
13:02 - one committing so it's maybe a little
13:03 - bit of overkill right now but I wanted
13:06 - to have that that extra layer as a
13:09 - safeguard but then also because we did
13:12 - that we were able to we have Travis
13:13 - we're able to hook up what was it green
13:17 - keeper so green keeper is a it's a green
13:21 - keeper bought something like that green
13:23 - keeper will look at our package JSON
13:25 - file and anytime there's an update to
13:28 - one of the packages we have in there it
13:30 - will either auto update by automatically
13:35 - submitting a pull request with the
13:36 - update or if if it's really out of date
13:40 - and in Mike hello just like breaking
13:41 - changes then it may just kind of alert
13:44 - but that way we don't have to keep up
13:47 - with all the updates ourselves will
13:51 - automatically get pull requests with
13:54 - those updates so I had to use Travis to
13:59 - be able to do that I mean it probably
14:01 - didn't have to be just Travis I'm sure
14:03 - other systems like Travis little works
14:04 - but we had used I'm using Travis on a
14:11 - side project so Harshit who's in the
14:13 - live chat frequently but it's too late
14:16 - in this time zone to watch right now and
14:19 - he's done a lot of work on these other
14:21 - project he set it up in the side project
14:23 - so I just kind of took what he did and
14:25 - tried to adapt it so basically I have
14:28 - the unit test running but I don't have
14:32 - the end-to-end test running so I ran
14:36 - into some issues with the end-to-end
14:37 - test mainly due to trying to run a
14:40 - headless browser with Travis and I
14:43 - decided that it's not really important
14:45 - right now and I needed to just move on
14:46 - and get some stuff done so we're gonna
14:48 - go back to it and at some point but for
14:51 - right now I thought you know what we
14:55 - don't
14:55 - they have test coverage on all of our
14:57 - components like not even close so if
14:59 - we're gonna have this setup let's write
15:01 - some unit tests also how to request from
15:03 - somebody on Twitter about doing unit
15:05 - tests so said all right let's do it
15:08 - so that's what we'll be doing today and
15:11 - what else that out I'm sure I worked on
15:15 - some other things that I'm forgetting I
15:17 - I know I did a lot of work on the the
15:21 - router adding new routes making sure
15:24 - links work so there's a lot more pages
15:26 - that work now cleaned up a ton of data
15:29 - on the WordPress side of things just
15:32 - kind of combining things that were all
15:35 - separate that didn't need to be
15:36 - separated making sure the slugs were
15:38 - were correct so doing a lot of that kind
15:43 - of work which is not really fun it's
15:48 - just really kind of time-consuming it
15:50 - needs to be done so I don't really like
15:51 - to stream that that kind of stuff okay
15:55 - so let me let's first just check out
16:01 - some of the tests that we have right now
16:03 - so I'm gonna get rid of some of this
16:04 - stuff we are going to use enzyme and
16:11 - jest
16:12 - so as far as as I know from what I've
16:15 - looked up the last few days on unit
16:18 - testing okay we have a question about
16:21 - explaining what unit testing is I'll do
16:23 - that right now let me start my timer
16:28 - there we are so 25 minutes of code then
16:33 - I'll go back to the live chat and answer
16:34 - questions so a unit test especially in
16:39 - the context of react would be like
16:41 - you're testing one component all right
16:44 - or you won if it wasn't react you could
16:47 - test like one function right so it
16:51 - you're not having this entire page and
16:54 - then you know rendering the whole page
16:56 - and seeing how it works
16:58 - you're just saying like okay like I'm
17:01 - gonna if I give this component these
17:03 - props this should happen and the test
17:06 - just checks to make sure the
17:08 - that actually happens so for each thing
17:12 - that you had each component each piece
17:14 - of a component you want to write a test
17:17 - ideally the way you're supposed to do it
17:19 - you write the test first and the test
17:23 - fails and then you make the test you
17:26 - write you change your code so that it
17:28 - passes the test so you think about what
17:30 - are all the things I want this code to
17:32 - do you put it all into the test and then
17:35 - you know your code is good once it
17:37 - passes all the tests and you make sure
17:39 - you have test coverage because you you
17:42 - test you grid birth to test first
17:44 - now we've already done a lot of code
17:48 - without testing so we're gonna have to
17:50 - go back and write the tests usually when
17:53 - you do it like that your tests aren't as
17:54 - good but that's where we're at so maybe
17:58 - moving forward we'll start doing tests
18:00 - first you know at first when we started
18:03 - this project I was on a much tighter
18:05 - timeline and then things changed and now
18:07 - I have more time so now we can work on
18:12 - testing so let's see what tests we have
18:15 - first since I have having index page
18:20 - open here so let me let me make some
18:24 - space and open this page yeah that's not
18:35 - what I wanted to index all right so
18:38 - here's the test that we have for the
18:40 - index page and now this is not a
18:42 - complete test this is just the start of
18:44 - of the test that we have so oh I didn't
18:50 - explain what just an enzyme is so just
18:52 - is a testing I don't we call a framework
18:57 - a testing tool I believe Facebook
18:59 - created just that's what if I remember
19:04 - correctly I think they did enzyme is
19:07 - created by a different different people
19:09 - created it so not Facebook but it is
19:11 - recommended by Facebook for testing
19:13 - react so
19:20 - enzyme can enzyme makes testing a bit
19:25 - easier and it can work with different
19:26 - things so you don't have to use it with
19:28 - jest you can use it for different things
19:32 - alright cool Aniki says enzyme is airbnb
19:35 - awesome Thank You Nikki that is that is
19:38 - correct I do remember saying that I was
19:41 - on their their github repo yesterday all
19:44 - right so you can use enzyme with a lot
19:49 - of different testing frameworks so we're
19:53 - gonna use it with Jess today but it's
19:54 - not just just so I I really am not
19:58 - familiar enough with it to tell you all
20:00 - the details about why you want to use
20:02 - enzyme I read and watch videos about it
20:05 - yesterday but I didn't retain everything
20:11 - so I'll just take you through this basic
20:13 - one first so we describe right so we're
20:16 - saying index so the component index
20:19 - which is this whole component right so
20:25 - index should render right it should
20:29 - render all right we have our little
20:31 - arrow functions here if you're not
20:33 - familiar with arrow functions like it's
20:35 - just pretty much like a regular function
20:36 - for for our purposes right now it's it's
20:39 - pretty much like a regular function so
20:40 - if you see this weird error thing just
20:43 - think somebody's putting function making
20:45 - a new function so it should render this
20:53 - cost repair render index expect wrapper
20:57 - I didn't write this that's I'm just
21:01 - trying to figure out going on what's
21:02 - going on so what does this mean are we
21:04 - just rendering it renders a component
21:10 - called index are they really that basic
21:16 - so I guess we're just testing whether or
21:19 - not it renders period like does this
21:22 - component render at all so I mean this
21:24 - is the most basic of test we need more
21:28 - than than this
21:29 - so we're gonna try to pick some piece of
21:35 - this and add it now we have pieces like
21:39 - this like here oh that's its own
21:40 - component like we can write a separate
21:42 - test for that component so what I'm
21:44 - talking about a piece I don't mean a
21:46 - separate component I mean you know
21:50 - something within here that's not within
21:51 - its own component which it looks like
21:55 - everything else is in its own component
21:57 - okay um do we have any special stuff
22:02 - going on no we don't do it Wow all right
22:09 - so we do need to make sure I guess that
22:16 - some things are rendering right
22:21 - Neela says how about using shallow
22:23 - instead of pure render yeah you know
22:25 - what I was wondering the same thing if
22:27 - we can just use shallow render I don't
22:30 - see why we need to use regular render
22:34 - here everything that I saw it was saying
22:38 - to use the shallow render so let's try
22:39 - that out shallow hmm okay
22:53 - so render do we have to replace this
22:59 - with shallow
23:10 - okay Nikki says then expected with to
23:13 - match snapshot yeah
23:23 - okay all right so we've got a lot of
23:27 - chat about all the differences now in
23:29 - the live chat so I mean I may wait and
23:32 - hold off and go over that after our 25
23:34 - minutes here which it may not be a bad
23:36 - idea to bring up the basic documentation
23:39 - for this as well so let me get that I'm
23:48 - gonna get that ready on my other screen
23:50 - and then if I think it'll be useful I'll
23:52 - pull it over and share it with you
23:54 - always whoa oh my I have a bunch of
24:07 - windows open with just an enzyme
24:09 - resources on my laptop I'm currently on
24:13 - my my iMac so I don't have any of the
24:15 - same stuff okay now's a great time to
24:25 - mention that this is me doing my regular
24:27 - work and it's a totally don't prepare
24:31 - things ahead of time because I want you
24:33 - all to see my mistakes too so that also
24:36 - means that I frequently don't have the
24:39 - the links ready all right so I do have
24:43 - something useful so this is cool right
24:46 - away it says shallow rendering renders
24:50 - only the component itself without its
24:53 - children so if you change something in a
24:56 - child component it won't change the
24:58 - shallow output of your component or a
25:01 - bug introduced to a child component
25:03 - won't break your components test it also
25:06 - doesn't require the Dom okay so that's
25:11 - the difference which is actually pretty
25:13 - good I think that I like that right
25:17 - because if there's an error in a child
25:19 - component but it doesn't nestled all the
25:25 - components I'd rather just have that
25:27 - child component fail the test and not
25:30 - the main component anyway so that makes
25:32 - a lot of sense
25:36 - I like this for sure let's see is the
25:42 - difference okay
25:49 - icon component okay cool so it doesn't
25:53 - actually render out the components this
25:55 - is awesome so this is what I kind of
25:58 - like the basic test that we can do or
26:01 - let's look at all the components that
26:03 - are supposed to be on the index page and
26:05 - let's make sure that they're actually
26:06 - there alright so here's some snapshot
26:13 - testing
26:23 - oh cool here's some cool stuff why Jess
26:25 - why enzyme let me just paste this link
26:27 - in because I'm not gonna read through a
26:30 - page on the stream but I will put the
26:33 - link in there so that'll answer a lot of
26:34 - the questions that I just saw on the
26:36 - live chat about why would we use just an
26:38 - enzyme Oh
26:41 - even has you know how do you set it up
26:44 - now we already have it set up in the
26:46 - project so I'm not going to go over that
26:47 - and I someone else set that up so I'm
26:50 - I'm definitely not the one to tell you
26:52 - how to set it up there we are so now
26:57 - let's just write some basic tests and so
27:03 - this for most non interactive components
27:05 - our index page realistically is is
27:07 - pretty non interactive we don't have
27:10 - anything going on that responds to user
27:12 - input at least not yet oops
27:17 - yet nikola says the links of 404 try
27:20 - copy manually copying and pasting the
27:22 - link there's there's something weird
27:25 - that happens with links in the YouTube
27:28 - chat okay
27:35 - it's night remember too much snow shot
27:41 - just
27:46 - all right I think I'm gonna move this
27:49 - over to the other screen so I can go
27:51 - back to the code and still see this so
27:58 - at least on this page on our index page
28:02 - I don't think we'll need to test events
28:04 - but at some point we're gonna want to
28:07 - test events like on click and things
28:09 - like that
28:10 - so let's see let's see if we should
28:15 - change the way we're doing this and I
28:23 - just want to make sure my syntax is
28:25 - correct
28:33 - also and make sure these aren't out of
28:36 - date where I'm getting the syntax room
28:50 - okay so we're describing index okay now
29:06 - okay you know what I didn't need to
29:08 - change renderer so the things that are
29:10 - inside these are just what should happen
29:15 - index should render and so we want to
29:20 - shell a render check for index and we've
29:25 - named it this Const wrapper and we're
29:27 - expecting wrapper okay so now let's do
29:34 - another test I believe we can do
29:39 - multiple tests
29:48 - right whoops let me make sure I don't
29:51 - lose track of it should show Nicki says
29:56 - it should shallow yeah that's good yeah
30:01 - sorry about that
30:03 - I just did my you know control I did
30:07 - like my multiple cursors here and did
30:09 - them both at once and not exactly what I
30:11 - needed to do
30:25 - okay mmm we're gonna do snapshots I
30:32 - guess I guess the first thing we should
30:42 - do is just see like have our changes so
30:44 - far mess up anything right since I'm
30:48 - learning this along with you all let's
30:51 - go incrementally and we can just run
30:53 - tests that's I forget what the command
30:56 - is for for just running the unit test I
31:03 - think it's just unit actually yeah let's
31:06 - just try that let's go yeah unit test
31:15 - hey cool
31:18 - all right so the test did pass so we
31:22 - haven't messed up anything too badly
31:26 - which is awesome
31:30 - all right cool Nikki thank you for
31:32 - putting that in there that's what I was
31:33 - just reading that on my other screen and
31:35 - wondering like should we do that so
31:37 - we're not going to just expect wrapper
31:39 - you want to expect it to match snapshot
31:53 - okay
32:03 - so you want to do that and then yeah I
32:10 - believe that we can just go down through
32:13 - here and make sure I don't have to
32:23 - confirm any of the terminal
32:31 - okay let's do that yeah that's so we
32:33 - should get a snapshot yeah we get a
32:43 - snapshot file now so you can see now we
32:47 - have the snapshot you sent your snap of
32:54 - yeah I won't help with snap follow
32:56 - snapshot tools
33:12 - anybody use this let's try it I want
33:17 - pretty colors on my snapshot do we need
33:23 - to reload all right Rilla remove w from
33:30 - wrapper or make the other one capital
33:40 - all right let's see your snapshot is
33:45 - okay now we have pretty colors Wow that
33:53 - creates quite a bit Wow alright then
33:58 - okay so
34:11 - Aniki says all you're getting all that
34:13 - extra JSON you snapshots yes yes it
34:23 - looks like we can add something else in
34:33 - that might help with that
34:45 - I mean I guess it I guess this should
34:48 - work for now so I'm not going to add
34:49 - anything if this is working for now but
34:51 - Nikki I guess
35:03 - yeah we can make this Nikki you say we
35:07 - should make this a lowercase W I'm cool
35:10 - with that
35:18 - all right so let's let's add some stuff
35:21 - in here just to see if we can do it and
35:22 - if it breaks then we know we can't do it
35:25 - so I want to add another test in here
35:28 - and we want to describe let's see
35:34 - hero hero and let's see
35:51 - chorus signing snapshot doesn't exist
35:54 - yeah
36:20 - sorry I'm trying to scroll down and see
36:22 - how they did this they don't really have
36:24 - examples and what I'm looking at now of
36:26 - doing multiple tests all at once and it
36:32 - looks like yeah isn't that terrible when
36:41 - your tutorials all are doing different
36:44 - things
36:59 - really quickly
37:12 - okay all right cool actually we also
37:18 - have some other stuff here so let me
37:21 - grab this so this another cheat or I get
37:25 - is recommending that we test if it's
37:27 - even defined that makes sense
37:30 - expect index to be defined wonderful so
37:35 - here's how we can do multiple tests on
37:37 - index we can also we can check other
37:45 - stuff with it but I think we're we're
37:48 - gonna be okay
37:49 - further right now
38:05 - all right so I want to see if this will
38:08 - work this guy feverish
38:20 - actually no I don't think that'll be it
38:22 - I think it would be up here describe
38:26 - index it should
38:35 - to render the new back to her I want to
38:41 - go back to the snapshot I want to see
38:43 - how this looks in the snapshot I know we
38:48 - had a bunch of info but there's got to
38:50 - be somewhere where actually we can see
38:52 - it maybe
38:56 - [Music]
39:02 - okay Nikki's looking the up the thing
39:05 - that that removes a bunch of the JSON
39:12 - that's cool so this is pulling in a lot
39:16 - of other stuff where's my actual
39:29 - Oh
39:32 - how about
39:42 - what about this Nikki does this look
39:45 - familiar
40:17 - okay
40:19 - all right cool let's see I don't even
40:24 - know if I have this package no this is
40:27 - gonna work
40:27 - I'm not sure what was actually all right
40:32 - cool yay we finally got a broken thing
40:41 - cool
40:46 - alright let's just get it then
41:02 - let me know what you all think about
41:05 - streams like this where I don't really
41:07 - know what I'm doing either and we work
41:08 - through it together I I mean I kind of
41:12 - think there's some value in showing the
41:14 - process of me like as a developer
41:17 - working through something new but if you
41:20 - think this is just kind of more of a
41:22 - waste of your time because we're I don't
41:25 - I mean we're just kind of working
41:27 - through it then you know let me know
41:29 - I'll try to only stream about things
41:32 - that I'm more comfortable doing and have
41:33 - more experience with or if you think
41:35 - there's some value in this you know I'll
41:37 - try to do this you know occasionally as
41:39 - well all right so let's see if this
41:45 - works
41:48 - whoa
41:50 - still not not working
42:03 - yeah so you had a bunch of stuff
42:31 - this gigantic file in here oh that's why
42:40 - it's all this stuff from the theme
42:41 - provider
43:13 - Halla John says what you gonna tab up
43:15 - with 5% battery left well just
43:20 - preemptively since your tablet's gonna
43:22 - die see you thanks for what
43:25 - alright let's what did it say
43:37 - interesting okay cool
43:39 - so let's see what we get now after we
43:42 - did that yarn unit you to update our
43:46 - stuff alright we're still getting a ton
43:48 - of stuff because that's coming in with a
43:54 - theme provider component and then at the
43:56 - bottom we have losses with styles index
44:01 - page okay alright then
44:15 - all right I am at the end of my Pomodoro
44:19 - session so let's go five minutes I'm
44:21 - going to come back to the chat and
44:23 - answer as many questions as I can
44:25 - well how there's a lot in the chat
44:26 - already a boy says I'm excited about
44:33 - this awesome
44:34 - oh well so so far I don't know how how
44:37 - good I've been doing but hopefully
44:39 - you're still excited
44:54 - I'm just scrolling through trying to
44:56 - find things I haven't already answered
45:12 - Oh world says testing always look like a
45:14 - waste of time for me I don't know I mean
45:16 - honestly it it seems like it would just
45:20 - take a lot longer I'm trying to trust
45:23 - and believe everything that I've read
45:25 - and heard about testing that in the long
45:27 - run it saves you time because there'll
45:30 - be less to fix so that's that's what I'm
45:35 - going with
45:54 - one day of s if I use Pomodoro on a
45:57 - daily basis I do I use Pomodoro
46:00 - whenever I'm coding and just to break
46:03 - things up and to help me estimate how
46:07 - long things will take like I keep track
46:09 - of how many Pomodoro sessions certain
46:12 - activities take and then I can go back
46:15 - and look through that and get a better
46:17 - estimate of how long the future projects
46:19 - will take excuse me sorry for the on ice
46:25 - to drink more coffee
46:35 - Kampai asks what's your vs code /
46:38 - linting setup like Aniki says es linen
46:42 - and prettier yeah yeah I mean that's
46:44 - that's pretty much it I I have a lot of
46:48 - other stuff with BS code I should do a
46:51 - video on that because I do get that
46:53 - question occasionally
47:16 - Nilesh says what does enzyme to json
47:19 - actually do okay and that nikki says
47:27 - check out the snapshot after you run the
47:30 - test to see the difference so it might
47:32 - have been hard to catch with all that
47:33 - extra stuff in there but hopefully you
47:36 - could see at the bottom at least that
47:39 - now we have like it looks like JSX right
47:42 - before we had I don't know what did it
47:46 - was it objects or I mean we had some
47:48 - JavaScript stuff going on in there
47:50 - before but it definitely wasn't JSX this
47:53 - is a lot easier to read I mean
47:55 - unfortunately we still have all this
47:57 - stuff but now we can hopefully on some
48:03 - other components we won't have all that
48:06 - stuff and it'll be way more obvious what
48:09 - what we see in the test Carlos says I
48:17 - love it actually it's better cuz we
48:19 - learn as you learn we see even your
48:21 - train of thought on the process okay
48:23 - cool so that was in response to my
48:25 - question about like do you all like
48:27 - whenever I come into a stream not really
48:30 - knowing what's what's going on and we
48:32 - learn as we go
48:36 - brian says I like it because it makes me
48:38 - feel better about myself when I struggle
48:40 - I never get to see someone actually
48:41 - figuring something out it's always
48:43 - smooth sailing in videos all right cool
48:45 - yeah I mean that was one of the things
48:46 - when I originally started streaming that
48:48 - I thought too is like hey there are a
48:50 - lot of other people doing really good
48:51 - videos and it is smooth sailing all the
48:54 - time like why don't I do videos where I
48:57 - do make mistakes and I do try to learn
49:00 - it would be cool for people to see that
49:07 - Raul says can I become a like you
49:11 - someday trying to convince my parents
49:13 - but all they need is to get me a
49:15 - although ones get you a degree
49:19 - Raoh I would say the best thing you can
49:22 - do right now to try to convince your
49:24 - parents is just get as good as you can
49:26 - at being a developer and if you could
49:29 - take on
49:29 - projects I don't know how old you are
49:31 - but if you can or what what the laws are
49:33 - like where you're from but you know in
49:36 - the United States you know you just
49:37 - start taking on side projects and
49:39 - working you know as a teenager so that
49:42 - might be one way to prove that this is
49:44 - realistic you know career-wise but if
49:47 - your parents want you to get a degree
49:49 - and you can get a scholarship or your
49:51 - parents will pay for it I definitely
49:54 - think you should still try for the
49:55 - degree like keep working keep working
49:59 - and getting better with coding but you
50:01 - really can't pass up the opportunity for
50:03 - a free or really discounted degree now
50:06 - if you're looking at having to pay for
50:07 - the whole degree yourself then it's not
50:11 - such a good deal then I mean it kind of
50:13 - depends on you know your country in the
50:15 - situation you're in but if I had to
50:19 - choose all over again and I had to pay
50:22 - for the school myself I was lucky in at
50:25 - scholarships I might just choose to
50:28 - become a developer and work full-time as
50:30 - a developer without the degree I
50:32 - couldn't have got this job but I
50:34 - certainly still could have got all my
50:35 - freelance clients that I had before I
50:37 - got this job so anyway but that does is
50:41 - general advice so I don't know all your
50:43 - particular circumstances so you know you
50:46 - have to take that into into account all
50:49 - right so my timer went off but I only
50:52 - have a few more things in the chat so
50:54 - let me just get these last few things
50:56 - before we start up again let's see Aniki
51:00 - says for that plug-in to work you need
51:01 - add a Jess config JSON file okay cool
51:05 - good to know
51:07 - Patrick hey that's my uncle hey uncle
51:11 - Pat how's it going I'm glad that you
51:13 - could watch Patrick says in the comments
51:16 - and the chat are great awesome
51:20 - Nikki says all hearts should probably
51:22 - set up the chest config inside your
51:23 - package JSON yes I do believe
51:26 - okay so role is saying I'm from India
51:29 - and let me know if I'm pronouncing your
51:31 - name correctly as well I don't have any
51:33 - resources but very interested in coding
51:36 - all right well I don't know exactly how
51:39 - it is in India but in the United States
51:41 - University costs
51:43 - a lot of money for for most schools some
51:46 - schools are more affordable but it does
51:47 - cost a lot of money so it's it's it's
51:54 - almost at the point right now for
51:55 - universities that if you can't get some
51:57 - type of financial help it's gonna take
51:59 - you a really really long time to pay
52:01 - back the loans that you have to take out
52:03 - so if you want to go into a tech related
52:06 - field where you don't really need a
52:08 - degree to get a job it doesn't make
52:11 - sense to spend all that money some so if
52:16 - that's really true really want to do I
52:18 - would say again try to get as good as
52:21 - you can and get actual paying jobs to
52:23 - prove to your parents that you can
52:26 - really make money doing this that might
52:29 - be the best way best way to go about it
52:35 - my wife's calling me let me tell her I'm
52:38 - doing a live stream hello hey I'm doing
52:44 - a live stream you're on YouTube is it is
52:50 - an emergency okay you want me a call you
52:57 - want to know with the stream all right
53:00 - hi okay
53:09 - cool
53:11 - oh my Uncle Pat's at the Denver Airport
53:13 - watching that's cool that the Wi-Fi at
53:16 - the airport is good enough to to watch
53:21 - all right so I'm getting a lot more
53:23 - questions now so I'm going to hold hold
53:26 - off on these questions until after this
53:28 - next Pomodoro cycle so let's get started
53:31 - again I am gonna check quickly because
53:34 - Nikki's putting some some stuff in the
53:38 - chat about how to set this up all right
53:46 - we need to also add a polyfill to the
53:48 - setup files okay well let's let's go to
53:51 - our package.json where's it that I
53:54 - thought we opened it up and now it's not
53:57 - here we mean I I need to close some of
53:59 - this out it's way too much wow I didn't
54:12 - realize I had so much open oh and there
54:18 - it is there's my package Jason I thought
54:20 - I had it open okay so let's see yeah so
54:27 - here's our just sort of shims arches
54:36 - okay we do have that polyfill already
54:39 - there so yes I guess Harshit must have
54:41 - already set all that up even has the
54:44 - adapter for reacts 16 which is awesome
54:50 - okay cool so maybe were we're all good
54:53 - to go then
55:09 - all right so let's um let's see I want
55:16 - to try I got I really want to try to
55:20 - make do a component that does something
55:23 - more than the index should we do the
55:27 - hero or sex section let's just do this
55:33 - tech section because we don't we don't
55:35 - have anything for that yet
55:36 - so this will be like fresh test and
55:42 - we'll try it out so let me just import
55:49 - now I want to use what we what we just
55:52 - did index test so let me copy and paste
55:55 - this into a new file and what we're
56:08 - naming these so this will be text
56:19 - okay yeah so it's not pages index this
56:26 - is going to be components slash text
56:37 - text section
56:50 - okay so in these ones we can at least
56:53 - have section alright whoops
57:00 - I forgot this part okay so so far we
57:09 - haven't done anything different
57:11 - we're just bringing in what we already
57:17 - had and we just changed it to be tech
57:19 - section instead of index but now we can
57:23 - test well let's let's save it and just
57:27 - verify that we haven't mess anything up
57:28 - so far and then we can start to test
57:30 - things like it does it if we pass it
57:32 - this prop does it actually display that
57:35 - right or you know any of these props so
57:38 - we can go through each prop give it some
57:40 - data some test data and then make sure
57:43 - that it actually does what we want it to
57:44 - do with that test data does that make
57:49 - sense
58:02 - so I just got distracted by a long email
58:05 - chain that my boss is CC'ing me on okay
58:17 - I'll just let them know I'll make the
58:20 - update
58:30 - okay so there's an update on a site that
58:35 - didn't get made that's kind of important
58:37 - that evidently someone else was supposed
58:40 - to make so I'm just going to do it
58:42 - before I leave because honestly it
58:45 - doesn't really matter whose was supposed
58:46 - to do it it needs to be done and I can
58:49 - probably do it faster than anybody else
58:52 - at this point
58:53 - that's not bragging it's just like I
58:54 - built the site so I can update it faster
58:59 - okay so did I run this test I didn't
59:10 - that was what I was gonna do let's run
59:13 - the test cool all right so you can see
59:18 - now we should have the text section
59:20 - let's see what we get all right so
59:23 - here's what it rendered out so text
59:27 - section and let's see object here was
59:32 - exception unit continues exercise very
59:34 - button interesting actually you know
59:40 - what we probably should check the
59:42 - component as well that would be useful
59:44 - so let's open up that text section
59:46 - component text section there we are okay
59:55 - so we can see here's what it what it has
60:01 - all right so
60:19 - interesting I had assumed that these
60:25 - were some of the things that were
60:28 - rendered like some of the components
60:31 - inside child components but the tax
60:36 - section section one interesting okay I'm
60:44 - not exactly sure what all this is maybe
60:46 - when we start adding some more tests and
60:48 - changing things we will find out I'll
60:51 - double check to see if any of you let me
60:54 - know what okay all right so let's write
61:06 - another test within that within that
61:11 - file so let's just take so we have it it
61:19 - should render I don't wanna this one
61:27 - doesn't have any events so we're not
61:29 - gonna test events for this one we may
61:32 - not get two events today we might have
61:34 - to do we might do another stream about
61:36 - testing that'll be a little bit more
61:40 - informative because well more practice
61:44 - with it but we should I'm trying to find
61:48 - the trying to find an example of how to
61:54 - add crops
62:11 - oh okay I remember now all right let's
62:27 - let's go alright so it should render
62:33 - check render text and let's say so we're
62:39 - gonna do the text section and let's say
62:43 - we're our props just go back to index so
62:49 - I can see the props so let's say text
62:58 - equals and then we could just give it
63:00 - some text right maybe
63:16 - why am I getting this once all multiple
63:18 - spaces okay
63:29 - let's see
63:35 - I'm not sure if this is all I need but
63:37 - let's see yeah let's see what happens so
63:48 - save it and then let's run some tests
63:50 - now we'll probably get that warning that
63:54 - something changed did we know we didn't
63:58 - ok cool maybe because it didn't change
64:00 - maybe just cuz we added things there we
64:05 - are
64:06 - did it test section in class should
64:09 - render text no actually that's not what
64:15 - we wanted
64:16 - I wanted it to actually render that
64:35 - okay yeah I wanted it I wanted it to
64:43 - show here like actual text inside of
64:47 - this component I guess I'm doing it
64:50 - wrong mm-hmm
64:54 - you know let me go I'm looking up all
64:56 - these tutorials but I should just look
64:58 - up the documentation so if you want to
65:06 - follow along I'm I'm going to the
65:08 - official enzyme repository on github so
65:13 - if you just type in enzyme github it
65:15 - should be the first thing that comes up
65:17 - in a Google search so I am going to
65:22 - click on there there's a bunch of
65:25 - options and one of them is using enzyme
65:30 - la just I'm gonna open that in a new tab
65:33 - for now and because the first thing in
65:36 - the docs is basic you should usage
65:38 - shallow rendering so I'm gonna look at
65:45 - what what's going on there
65:48 - just to make sure my my I guess syntax
65:52 - is correct
65:54 - so surrender texts so I notice that this
66:00 - is the style they're using when should
66:03 - render text wind past end which actually
66:05 - is correct because it shouldn't render
66:06 - and obviously it shouldn't render text
66:08 - if no text is passed okay looks like
66:15 - wrapper is just the default name that's
66:17 - used throughout so that that makes sense
66:19 - I was kind of wondering about that and
66:24 - let's see
66:38 - let's see
66:48 - so you wanted to say okay tech section
66:51 - text if we do have text it's not gonna
67:07 - render right in the middle right it's
67:08 - gonna render inside of a div class of
67:16 - section test
67:20 - she texts
67:23 - okay so what will happen is it'll render
67:29 - typography so all right let me see not
67:37 - sure if this is the right way to do it
67:39 - but let's try it out text section here
67:46 - but then within this we're gonna write
67:51 - typography
68:10 - I don't know I don't have a good feeling
68:12 - about this one pinkeye messing it up
68:25 - mm yeah let me check this
68:44 - yeah there's no way that's right let's
68:48 - see
69:07 - alright let's let me take this out for
69:10 - now and start again
69:19 - okay specs
69:41 - okay I may have to go to the full
69:44 - documentation
70:06 - okay yeah Brian I think that's a good
70:09 - idea I was just looking at that part of
70:12 - the documentation let's try that out I'm
70:16 - yeah let's just let's try it out and see
70:18 - what happens I'm a little bit worried
70:20 - about it because the text is gonna it's
70:24 - gonna be within the typography component
70:26 - so I'm not
70:27 - yeah I'm not exactly sure how this will
70:29 - render but I think that's it's worth a
70:33 - try to see you know what's gonna happen
70:36 - you know what shoot we we wanted to
70:46 - match the snapshot we don't want it to
70:49 - contain unique right that's that's what
70:52 - we want maybe I ought to go to the one
70:58 - that's specific for using jest with
71:00 - ensign yeah that'll be more helpful
71:10 - nice example tests
71:24 - all right so I'm going to show I'm gonna
71:26 - copy this into the live chat because
71:29 - it'll be easier to just go right there
71:32 - instead of me trying to describe how I
71:34 - got there but this is the example test
71:39 - with you if you're using jest with
71:41 - enzyme so let's see see what they're
71:46 - saying here
71:56 - hmm
72:06 - okay so we we can do different this is
72:09 - good to know so we can do different
72:11 - things within the same one so we don't
72:14 - just have to do shallow or just just
72:17 - render amount so that's good to know
72:27 - okay
72:32 - and I'm also going to check out the
72:37 - shallow rendering API
72:38 - [Music]
72:53 - all right I just realized the example I
72:56 - was looking at before when I was trying
72:57 - to put a lot of stuff in here was not it
73:04 - wasn't an example for passing props it
73:11 - was for passing children so it made
73:19 - sense for that but not not exactly for
73:22 - props
73:40 - hmm
74:17 - all right I am NOT I'm not finding the
74:24 - answers that I want for this
74:32 - all right so there we go so I tried I'm
74:38 - just gonna say this out loud somewhat
74:41 - for myself but also for you uh-huh
74:43 - just to know what's going on my head so
74:44 - I the goal is to make sure that if we
74:48 - pass in a prop it actually gets rendered
74:51 - properly and so we tried to just put in
74:56 - text section and pass in a prop like we
74:58 - normally would expecting that it would
75:01 - do something here but what we found is
75:06 - that we just get back text section and
75:09 - then down here it just has the prop we
75:12 - don't actually see it rendered anywhere
75:15 - this is kind of odd I guess some of the
75:21 - things are odd to me we don't get
75:23 - anything rendering inside here whereas I
75:27 - expected that we would get the child
75:32 - components you know not fully rendered
75:34 - but that the child components would be
75:39 - at least at least they would show up
75:53 - so that's where I'm at you know
75:55 - basically is what why is it not showing
75:58 - up and what do I need to do to have that
76:00 - show up and and test that
76:41 - so let me show you alright so obviously
76:43 - this is what we have right exports in
76:46 - the text section right but here's what
76:51 - I'm looking at as to you know maybe what
76:53 - it should be so you can see here they
76:57 - have exports so they have the component
76:59 - as link but then under exports it has an
77:05 - actual a tag with the href that they
77:10 - passed in and the title here so you
77:13 - could see like you know right here they
77:14 - passed in title as a prop they passed in
77:17 - monkey URL as a prop and we basically
77:19 - have the same we have all this is the
77:25 - same stuff right just not sure so I mean
77:31 - maybe maybe I should compare maybe I
77:33 - don't have all the same syntax here and
77:35 - the same stuff maybe that's the problem
77:37 - so maybe I shouldn't what if we don't it
77:46 - looks like this is different
77:47 - so describe text section
78:07 - okay let's try that out now that I think
78:11 - is the only difference that I noticed so
78:17 - let's run this again let's see okay so
78:28 - let's run that ad like we needed to
78:30 - before there we are
78:37 - okay now let's check what we have next
78:42 - section same same thing right it's still
78:45 - the same actually did we get no we
78:55 - didn't get anything right
79:01 - so we have now you know the first one
79:06 - we're not actually doing anything with a
79:11 - snapshot so this one and this one are
79:12 - giving us snapshots and let's I just
79:18 - want to be just double check that we are
79:22 - getting one
79:35 - hmm and this is what we're passing in
79:37 - correct text yeah
79:49 - interesting okay all right so my timer
79:57 - went off again so that was our second
80:00 - Pomodoro session I yeah I think I want
80:06 - to end now I mean partly because I've
80:08 - already put in over over time today so I
80:11 - don't really need to be here anymore but
80:15 - also I mean at this point I think the
80:17 - best thing for me to do would be to do
80:18 - some more research maybe a tutorial
80:20 - because I'm I'm one number one a little
80:24 - afraid that I'm mixing some little
80:26 - techniques and some new techniques
80:27 - because the tutorials that I have the
80:31 - documentation I have right now some
80:32 - glitch old and then yeah I kind of feel
80:37 - like I've gotten to a place where I
80:38 - don't have many more ideas left so I
80:42 - need to get back to the research so
80:46 - that'll be what I do between now and the
80:48 - next time you come back to this which
80:50 - will probably be after Easter
80:53 - so I I said I'm probably gonna do a
80:55 - stream from home tomorrow working with
80:56 - that brain computer interface so it'll
81:00 - be unrelated to this and then I'm off on
81:01 - Monday and then so next Tuesday will
81:05 - probably be the next time I stream so it
81:08 - should be a while it'll give me a lot of
81:10 - time to research I guess I mean
81:12 - technically I'm off tomorrow too so I
81:14 - don't really have three six so maybe
81:18 - I'll research on Tuesday morning before
81:23 - I stream okay so what I'd like to do now
81:27 - is go back through the rest of the
81:29 - comments and answer any questions that
81:31 - you have you read out some relevant
81:34 - comments okay Nicki says do a push yeah
81:39 - thank you for reminding me yeah so if
81:43 - any of you want to check out what was
81:45 - done test things out you know mess
81:47 - around feel free I'm about to push this
81:51 - to the github repo the links in the
81:52 - description everything in the repo is
81:55 - completely you know open for you all to
81:58 - use for whatever you want
82:01 - I mean excluding obviously like the
82:03 - Franciscan logo and stuff like that
82:06 - can't use that all right I'm just
82:09 - double-checking to make sure that the
82:11 - things that changed or actually what we
82:14 - expect to change and I will do a git add
82:17 - to add everything and we're gonna do
82:21 - yarn CM and that's a little tool we have
82:24 - running on top of the normal get thing
82:26 - just to help us make a nice commit
82:29 - message otherwise you just want to type
82:33 - in git commit and add the M flag and
82:36 - then put your message so we're gonna add
82:38 - we're gonna make this a test so this is
82:42 - gonna say update and it should say add
82:49 - tests for index dot J's and text section
82:59 - J s okay no breaking changes I don't
83:06 - think we have any issues for that so
83:08 - it's going to run through hopefully it
83:10 - can pass the test yep so passes the test
83:12 - the cool thing about unit testing too is
83:15 - it's very fast compared to end-to-end
83:17 - testing because end-to-end testing
83:19 - actually opens up ahead at least the way
83:21 - we're doing it opens up a headless
83:22 - browser and it has to wait for the Dom
83:24 - to load the dawn in comparison to just
83:27 - plain JavaScript is very slow so we
83:30 - should probably write way more unit
83:33 - tests than we do end-to-end tests if for
83:36 - no other reason other reasons but one of
83:39 - the reasons would be if we wrote a ton
83:41 - of end-to-end test testing would take
83:43 - forever but if we do unit tests you can
83:47 - see look all four of our tests pass in
83:50 - just over two seconds not really you
83:54 - know not really that long to wait all
83:56 - right so now I'm going to do a git push
83:59 - and all of this code is now available on
84:05 - github let me scroll up a bit try to
84:08 - find where I left off and answer
84:10 - questions if you have any questions
84:12 - please put them in the live chat
84:18 - and I just now realized that I have no
84:21 - music playing in my headphones this
84:23 - entire time I've been wearing them and
84:25 - nothing's been in them and I feel silly
84:28 - I guess I should turn music on that all
84:35 - right now there's music all right Brian
84:42 - says I'm looking into a startup that
84:44 - will teach the computer science stuff
84:46 - that actually matters plus coding it
84:49 - would be about nine months to a year
84:51 - kind of like College meets boot camp
84:53 - interesting I've actually I had an idea
84:56 - for something kind of like that here at
84:59 - the university that I work for basically
85:01 - you do it you wouldn't get a degree for
85:04 - it but that would be good because we
85:05 - could speed up the process of getting it
85:07 - here and not have to worry about
85:09 - accreditation and all the red tape that
85:11 - comes with adding new programs but it
85:14 - would basically just give you know a
85:16 - certificate so it'd be somewhat like a
85:17 - boot camp but we would have different
85:19 - tracks so if you wanted to know an about
85:21 - like web development you could do that
85:23 - if you know we could offer some of the
85:26 - newer exciting things so if you want to
85:29 - about learn about machine learning you
85:31 - could do that VRA are you could do that
85:34 - and it would be something that the
85:36 - computer science students could do like
85:38 - let's say in the summertime to get
85:41 - better skills it would be project-based
85:43 - so they could put on their resume or
85:45 - other people who aren't interested in a
85:47 - degree could still come I'm kind of
85:51 - thinking it would be online though so
85:52 - they wouldn't necessarily have to come
85:53 - here because then we have to figure out
85:55 - all about like housing and stuff like
85:56 - that so just to try to keep it like as
85:59 - bare-bones as possible when it's easy to
86:01 - start it would be online to start but
86:05 - anyway I I've only talked to a few
86:07 - people about it so far the people that I
86:09 - have talked to hear about it I've said
86:12 - it was a good idea I just need to get it
86:14 - I need to be able to talk to people high
86:16 - enough up that it can actually happen
86:19 - but anyway so Brian I really like your
86:24 - idea I I think that's a cool idea
86:28 - because I have so people who do the boot
86:31 - camps sometimes lack some knowledge that
86:34 - a computer science students would have
86:36 - gotten but it's it's not really it
86:39 - doesn't really make financial sense for
86:41 - boot camp people who have come out and
86:42 - you know potentially have gotten jobs
86:44 - already to go back and get a computer
86:46 - science degree but if they could get
86:49 - some of that in a boot camp format that
86:52 - wouldn't that would make a lot more
86:53 - sense I like that idea
86:57 - Carlos says I honestly have no idea what
86:59 - we are doing with these tests but I
87:01 - think it's great to be doing testing I
87:03 - used to do it with rails but you
87:05 - definitely didn't get that much info on
87:07 - the test whoo well hopefully Carlos I
87:13 - don't know what I'm doing with these
87:15 - tests either so we're in the same boat
87:17 - just trying to learn learn as we go
87:20 - along all right so here's some more
87:29 - advice so Raul was talking about you
87:33 - know advice - I'm sorry not Raul this is
87:38 - a different question Kemah asked do you
87:40 - have any advice for novice freelancers
87:42 - so Pat says there are a lot of free
87:46 - courses and training sessions on web
87:48 - build as many webpage as possible that
87:50 - training is valuable yeah definitely
87:54 - that's how I am doing what I'm doing I
87:57 - would say at least 90% of what I did
88:00 - training wise was all free resources
88:05 - yaqoob says how to pass variable from
88:07 - routes to handlebars anyone I need to
88:10 - display a number of documents in my new
88:11 - MongoDB I haven't used handlebars in I
88:16 - don't know like two years at least so I
88:20 - I don't remember offhand I'm sorry if
88:23 - anybody else is familiar with handle
88:25 - using handlebars with MongoDB please you
88:29 - know add add a comment in to help out
88:32 - Jakub sorry I just I never use
88:37 - handlebars that much and it
88:39 - been a long time Rollo says currently
88:48 - after my high school I'm taking a
88:50 - preparation for entrance as last time I
88:52 - was unable to qualify but this time I
88:55 - hope for everything everything's go in a
88:58 - good way
88:59 - yeah well good luck with that I hope it
89:00 - goes well for you too Bryan says does
89:04 - anyone think the complete react guide on
89:06 - udemy is any good or any books in
89:09 - particular I haven't done the complete
89:12 - react guide on udemy so I can't really
89:17 - actually I've heard it pronounced you to
89:19 - me have I been pronouncing it wrong the
89:22 - whole time is it you to me or that makes
89:26 - I guess that sounds better you tell me
89:28 - you do me I don't know let me know how
89:31 - you all pronounce it
89:32 - udemy or you to me it doesn't really
89:37 - matter you all know what I'm talking
89:38 - about either way I guess yeah so I don't
89:43 - I don't know because I don't have any
89:44 - experience with that I do know that the
89:47 - reacts nanodegree program with Udacity
89:51 - was good I did go through that it was
89:53 - good if you're already experienced
89:56 - though with react and redux and maybe
89:58 - have some experience with react native
89:59 - it you might not learn as much from it
90:02 - but if you don't have that much
90:05 - experience with Redux and react native
90:07 - then you could definitely learn a lot
90:08 - from the course
90:19 - oh okay so Carlos says that that's a
90:26 - good one doing that one too okay cool
90:31 - brian says I've read the road to learn
90:33 - react Carlos says he explains everything
90:37 - it's easy for him to understand okay so
90:38 - I guess the the complete react guide is
90:41 - is a good resource then rule says in
90:47 - India every parent with their child to
90:48 - get one of the government college and do
90:52 - just a job and they don't understand the
90:55 - in the internet at all this is as you
91:00 - replied in my comments I'm very happy
91:02 - well I'm glad you're happy about that
91:04 - hopefully my advice is is good for you
91:06 - like I said with me not understanding
91:09 - the culture and you know the economics
91:13 - and educational system in India I I feel
91:17 - like I can't give you really good advice
91:20 - really specific advice just kind of
91:22 - general stuff from from my perspective
91:24 - so just take that into consideration
91:27 - when when you're thinking about you know
91:31 - the advice that I gave you Carlos says I
91:39 - had the idea maybe it's incorrect but I
91:41 - thought that IT or anything computer was
91:43 - taught in a lot of Indian schools I says
91:49 - I've seen very good programmers from
91:51 - India Pat says there is a lot of good
91:54 - programming going on in Bangalore cool
92:00 - yeah actually I just kind of as a side
92:03 - note anecdotal most of most of my
92:07 - viewers are from the United States but
92:09 - in a close second I get a lot of viewers
92:14 - from India as well so definitely a lot
92:17 - of programmers or a lot of people
92:18 - interested in programming watching from
92:20 - India that Glen says hello from Spain
92:25 - hey how's it going thanks for watching
92:26 - hey Jones back
92:29 - get a power cord
92:39 - okay
92:53 - aditya says am I the only new beer no no
92:56 - way I'm a noob too so don't worry about
93:01 - it and feel free to ask as many
93:02 - questions as you want
93:04 - Aditya says anyway what is he doing now
93:07 - we're truck we were trying to figure out
93:10 - how to do unit testing with some tools
93:14 - called enzyme and jest so we we had we
93:20 - made some progress and then kind of got
93:24 - caught up when we were trying to test
93:26 - out passing props in so if we do another
93:30 - stream about this which we probably will
93:33 - that's where we'll pick off or pick up
93:35 - and then the next step would be testing
93:38 - actions so like simulating user actions
93:41 - and testing what happens so you know
93:43 - what happens when you click on a button
93:44 - and things like that
93:56 - let's see and
94:10 - brian says dude I'm a noob too so don't
94:13 - feel like you're the only new we are
94:14 - learning here yeah for sure we're all
94:17 - Laurie everybody that's that's Cody no
94:19 - matter how many years they've been at it
94:21 - we're everybody still needs to learn
94:24 - things are always changing there's
94:26 - always more to learn Pat says once you
94:28 - have a basic understanding of
94:29 - object-oriented coding the rest is just
94:31 - practical experience languages change
94:33 - fast and new ones come out every year
94:36 - yeah for sure that that's it I mean you
94:41 - get the fundamentals down and the basics
94:42 - then you can move from from different
94:45 - languages and especially I know like in
94:48 - react land you know we do more of like
94:51 - functional programming but realistically
94:52 - object-oriented is important to know
94:54 - I've been doing some work with solidity
94:56 - which is a language to build block chain
95:00 - contracts on the etherion blockchain and
95:04 - it's all object oriented the syntax is
95:07 - very similar to JavaScript but I was
95:12 - using a strongly typed version of
95:15 - solidity called solidity X so it's it's
95:20 - definitely like imagine like
95:22 - object-oriented JavaScript like strongly
95:25 - typed so that's kind of what it's like
95:29 - but I started learning JavaScript before
95:32 - like the whole functional programming
95:34 - thing was really you know coming up so
95:37 - when I started learning it was like
95:39 - learn object-oriented you know stuff
95:42 - with JavaScript style
95:43 - I know Java scripts not really an
95:45 - object-oriented language but people were
95:49 - kind of using it like it was so that
95:54 - experience helped me to be able to pick
95:56 - up and learner solidity really quickly
95:59 - and know what was going on so anyway so
96:03 - I think there's still value in learning
96:04 - object-oriented stuff it'll help you and
96:06 - a lot of other things even though you
96:08 - wouldn't necessarily need it for react
96:11 - it still could help so it may not be
96:15 - like I have to learn it right away you
96:17 - could probably learn it on the side but
96:19 - it's still still good
96:24 - Carlos says new here also actually I'm a
96:29 - clinical psychologist go figure so I
96:31 - guess it's newer than a Newton cool
96:36 - that's cool your clinical psychologist I
96:38 - have my mother-in-law and my
96:40 - brother-in-law are both in the field and
96:43 - I have an uncle that's also in that that
96:47 - field I guess yeah we're the counselors
96:50 - yes oh and I think I have a cousin as
96:56 - well I have a lot of people that I know
96:58 - and then that field so very important
97:01 - field let's see
97:24 - Patrick says do you ever write
97:25 - performance test I haven't yet but now
97:31 - that you say that that sounds like a
97:32 - really good idea maybe I'll have to I'll
97:39 - have to look that up
97:40 - and see how you know how to do that with
97:43 - what I'm working with now krishna says
97:49 - may i know the university name sure it's
97:52 - Franciscan University of Steubenville so
97:56 - I mean that's if you go to the github
98:02 - repo for this project its links link
98:04 - below you'll see the name of the
98:05 - University it's used throughout you know
98:09 - some of the places in the site so you
98:11 - can get more info if you want it's a
98:14 - small university in in Ohio in the
98:18 - United States also says hey Jessie how's
98:23 - it going not too bad
98:26 - kind of struggled through this stream
98:27 - but we got some stuff done learned a lot
98:37 - okay so I've gotten to the end of the
98:40 - live chat and I think I'm gonna finish
98:43 - things up here and I'll probably see you
98:48 - tomorrow hopefully things will work out
98:51 - enough that we can get a decent stream
98:52 - with with this brain-computer interface
98:55 - stuff I'm very very new to it
98:57 - Alex Castillo is going to be helping out
98:59 - with that and he's much more experienced
99:01 - he's a developer for Netflix but in his
99:06 - spare time he works on brain computer
99:08 - interfaces especially using JavaScript
99:11 - with them so hopefully that'll go well
99:18 - tomorrow and then we'll come back to
99:20 - this project after the the Easter break
99:22 - if I don't see you and you're
99:24 - celebrating Easter this weekend have a
99:26 - happy Easter and O'Brien says don't
