00:00 - hey what's up everybody welcome back to
00:01 - css3 in 30 days today's day number 21
00:04 - and we're going to be coding up some
00:06 - animated css only spinners let's check
00:10 - it out
00:11 - animated spinners right here day number
00:13 - 21 we're going to be making these right
00:15 - here spinners what would you use a
00:16 - spinner for when you're loading content
00:19 - when you're loading a page you know when
00:22 - you're loading an application an image
00:24 - that's where you'd use a spinner you see
00:26 - it quite often in websites applications
00:29 - software
00:30 - uh it's simply or watching videos even
00:33 - the spinner just indicates that
00:35 - something is happening something is
00:37 - loading and it's uh
00:39 - they're kind of fascinating to look at
00:42 - and these are only made in or these are
00:44 - made
00:45 - in css3 only so
00:48 - let's jump in and get started
00:50 - here in our code editor we're going to
00:52 - go ahead and download day number 21
00:57 - spinners
00:58 - i'm gonna give you a
01:00 - second to do that in fact you could just
01:02 - pause the video go ahead and do that
01:04 - and i'm just gonna show you a couple
01:06 - things so here's the index
01:07 - file html is very simple it's simply a
01:10 - div with the class of spinner one and a
01:12 - dip with the class of spinner two that's
01:14 - it let's jump into our sandbox and get
01:16 - coding our css first thing we're gonna
01:19 - do is we're gonna select spinner dash
01:21 - one and we're gonna give it a position
01:23 - of relative display of inline
01:27 - block
01:28 - vertical line of middle
01:31 - and now we're going to give it a width
01:33 - 64 pixels and height 64 pixels
01:38 - and a border radius of 64 pixels you
01:42 - could also say 100 that should do the
01:44 - trick but 64 pixels means it is going to
01:46 - be if the border raises border radius
01:48 - for 64 pixels and it's the same as width
01:51 - and height then it's gonna be perfect
01:52 - circle
01:53 - all right
01:54 - if we save that
01:56 - you probably shouldn't actually see
01:58 - anything at this point you just see an
01:59 - empty space that's 64 by 64. beauty
02:02 - now we're going to do is we're going to
02:03 - say spinner dash 1 and the before sudo
02:07 - position absolute
02:10 - we got to give it a content of an empty
02:11 - string of course
02:13 - and width whoops width of 64 pixels
02:17 - height of 64 pixels
02:19 - and a border radius again 64 pixels
02:22 - we're going to give it a color of 3 2 3
02:25 - and this is the text color
02:28 - 323b40 but here's the thing there's
02:30 - going to be no text but we're going to
02:32 - be using an interesting css
02:34 - value called current color it's kind of
02:37 - like a css variable so watch this if i
02:40 - were to go
02:41 - box shadow inset
02:44 - negative 5 pixels 0 0 and then 5 pixels
02:47 - and then
02:48 - current color that's going to grab the
02:49 - actual color so it's kind of like you
02:51 - set a variable so i'm going to save that
02:53 - check it out in the browser you can see
02:55 - the current color is that gray
02:58 - because it's grabbing current color if i
03:00 - were to remove this i'm not really sure
03:02 - what would happen
03:03 - it looks like it would be it's grabbing
03:05 - the text color
03:07 - uh it's inheriting the text color from
03:09 - the body but if i were to change this to
03:11 - red
03:12 - the current color should be red so
03:14 - that's how that works right there pretty
03:15 - fun little css trick there and now we're
03:18 - going to do is we're going to clip this
03:20 - shape this unusual shape we just made to
03:23 - a rectangle but we're going to actually
03:26 - define the values here 0 64 pixels
03:30 - comma 32 pixels
03:33 - comma 0. that will give us this shape
03:36 - here again
03:38 - kind of weird
03:39 - but hang with me it's kind of like a
03:41 - like a like an 8-bit hockey stick
03:43 - hanging upside down
03:46 - but watch this
03:48 - we're going to actually say border
03:50 - radius
03:51 - oh here's the problem
03:55 - oh there we go border radius i thought i
03:57 - already added that
03:58 - but i didn't do it properly border 864
04:00 - so this hockey stick shape is actually
04:02 - going to now get this shape here
04:04 - that looks a lot nicer
04:07 - so
04:08 - you can see what the border radius did
04:09 - to change that so this
04:11 - this shape there without the border
04:12 - radius
04:14 - actually kind of looks like it's very
04:16 - unusual the right side of it is thicker
04:18 - the top side of it is is a bit thinner
04:21 - and long but the border radius really
04:23 - gives it a nice feel and you can almost
04:25 - see now how that's going to turn in you
04:27 - know how that's going to look when we
04:28 - spin it
04:29 - so now we're going to do is say
04:30 - animation
04:32 - we're going to give the animation name
04:34 - of rotator
04:37 - uh one second
04:38 - infinitely
04:40 - linear in fact i want to ease it i think
04:43 - that might be
04:44 - let's see what that looks like
04:46 - and now we need to create a keyframe so
04:49 - keyframes it's called rotator
04:51 - rotator
04:53 - at zero percent we're going to say
04:56 - transform and we're going to rotate it
04:59 - 180 degrees
05:03 - and let's uh say 50
05:06 - we're gonna go rotate
05:08 - to
05:09 - transform whoops transform
05:12 - rotate back to zero degrees
05:15 - and then 100
05:18 - we're gonna do
05:19 - back to
05:20 - 180 degrees let's see what that does
05:26 - interesting
05:29 - very interesting
05:31 - okay
05:33 - this the first one actually needs to be
05:34 - negative 180 degrees
05:36 - but i'm gonna try something here
05:39 - okay
05:42 - so do you see because i have an ease
05:44 - it's actually doing this like jump jump
05:47 - jump
05:48 - jump if i make it linear
05:50 - let's see it should just be spinning
05:53 - exactly but now i'm wondering if i just
05:55 - started at zero let's just try something
05:56 - start at zero and i just say 100 we spin
06:00 - at 360. it should still do the same
06:02 - thing
06:03 - yeah and now i can do ease
06:08 - i like that
06:12 - it's kind of neat
06:14 - so let's try that okay but now what i
06:16 - want to do is i wanted to also
06:18 - animate the box shadow
06:22 - and we're going to say
06:24 - inset negative 5 pixels 0 0 5 pixels
06:27 - current color that's in fact the same
06:29 - box shadows right now but we need to set
06:32 - it
06:33 - to this because what i want to do is now
06:36 - make a very uh variant make a variation
06:39 - of it so box shadow at
06:43 - okay this is where i might need
06:45 - let's try this negative one and then one
06:49 - let's see what that looks like
06:52 - very weird
06:54 - so
06:55 - here's where i'm going to actually throw
06:56 - that 50 back in there and i'm going to
06:59 - transform the whole thing
07:01 - i'm going to say 180 degrees here starts
07:04 - at 0
07:05 - to 180 degrees and then 360.
07:09 - and i'm going to do this box shadow
07:11 - at 50 i'm going to do this and then at
07:13 - 100 i'm going to go back to this
07:17 - that should give me an interesting
07:19 - effect
07:21 - okay
07:22 - it does do something it's kind of like a
07:25 - we're doing some weird stuff here folks
07:26 - we're gonna change this back to linear
07:28 - that should probably make there we go
07:31 - so there we go so you see how
07:34 - as it goes around it gets thinner and
07:36 - then thicker thinner and thicker it's
07:38 - kind of neat
07:39 - looks like a tadpole
07:42 - in a way now i don't like how
07:46 - it's thin on the side i kind of want to
07:48 - get thin at the top so that's where i'm
07:50 - going to go back here to zero percent
07:51 - i'm going to say negative 180 degrees to
07:53 - start at
07:54 - then it's gonna go spin to zero degrees
07:57 - at the top which will make it thin at
07:58 - the top and then i'm going to bring it
08:00 - to 180 degrees here
08:02 - that is going to change where
08:04 - it gets smaller
08:06 - at the top
08:08 - yep i like that that looks good there's
08:11 - our first rotator now let's go down to
08:13 - the next
08:14 - spinner so i'm going to leave the
08:15 - keyframes at the bottom good practice to
08:17 - do that so your code is organized the
08:19 - next spinner is going to be called or is
08:22 - called spinner dash 2
08:24 - position relative
08:26 - margin 32 all around
08:29 - and
08:30 - display
08:31 - inline block
08:34 - vertical align middle same styles as
08:37 - the top
08:38 - excuse me the top one uh
08:40 - those first four lines 16 pixels width
08:43 - 16 pixels height and then we're gonna do
08:46 - border radius
08:47 - this is where i had the problem last
08:48 - time i just wrote border instead of
08:50 - border radius 16 pixels
08:52 - background color
08:54 - three two three
08:56 - b four zero
08:58 - cool and now
08:59 - uh we're gonna
09:01 - save that and see if it does anything
09:03 - okay i call
09:05 - silly brad i said spinner one you
09:07 - probably caught that spinner two
09:10 - there we go so we have a dot we have a
09:12 - nice circle
09:14 - let's continue
09:15 - now i'm gonna say spinner dash two
09:19 - before pseudo-element and spinner dash 2
09:23 - after pseudo element
09:25 - position absolute
09:28 - display inline block
09:30 - vertical align middle
09:33 - height
09:34 - 16 pixels
09:36 - width 16 pixels
09:38 - border radius 16 pixels background color
09:43 - inherit
09:45 - content of course we need the content
09:46 - i'm gonna put that at the top
09:48 - i like it having right after position
09:50 - there we go
09:53 - and
09:54 - that's going to
09:56 - you're not going to see anything it's
09:57 - just creating the the sizes of the
10:00 - elements i don't think you're actually
10:02 - going to see it in fact no we don't see
10:04 - anything yet and we don't see anything
10:06 - yet because the position is
10:08 - absolute and we haven't given it any
10:11 - left or we haven't transformed it or
10:13 - moved it along the x-axis
10:16 - at all so it's actually just hiding
10:17 - behind this circle so they are there
10:19 - just hiding so that's where we're
10:21 - actually going to start animating
10:24 - so now i'm going to say spinner dash 2
10:26 - before i'm going to animate the before
10:29 - circle and i'm going to say transform
10:31 - and we're going to go translate x
10:34 - and that's going we're going to bring it
10:35 - 120
10:39 - that way
10:40 - so negative 120
10:42 - and so let's save that and
10:45 - cool okay so now what we're going to do
10:47 - is we're going to say transform origin
10:50 - so this lets you modify the origin for
10:52 - transformation so you can transform you
10:54 - can move where the origin of the element
10:56 - is so meaning like are you transforming
10:58 - from the center the top left the top
11:00 - right or any
11:01 - anywhere around the element itself you
11:04 - can see bottom center left top right you
11:06 - can actually use numeric values as well
11:09 - so let's go 32 pixels and so that's x
11:13 - and then y which
11:15 - is gonna be important
11:17 - once we start our animation so we're
11:19 - gonna call the first
11:20 - animation orbit dash one over one second
11:23 - let's do it infinite and linear to keep
11:26 - it safe
11:27 - and now we need to create that animation
11:30 - keyframe
11:32 - do it down here at the bottom keyframes
11:34 - and let's call it uh what we said we
11:37 - would orbit one
11:39 - zero percent we're going to say
11:41 - transform translate x we're going to go
11:45 - we're going to start at negative 120
11:47 - percent
11:48 - and
11:49 - we're going to rotate it 180 degrees so
11:52 - at zero percent that's its first
11:56 - step in the timeline
11:58 - then at
12:00 - let's do 30
12:02 - of the way through
12:05 - let's change the rotate to zero degrees
12:07 - and leave the translate at there at one
12:10 - negative 120. we're gonna go 70 percent
12:13 - the translate will remain the same
12:16 - and the rotate will stay at zero in fact
12:18 - we're going to leave it there for
12:21 - for that portion as well
12:23 - and then one more here translate x
12:26 - uh we're gonna go to negative 180
12:28 - degrees let's see
12:30 - what we just created okay interesting
12:32 - not quite where we're trying to get as
12:34 - you can see here this is kind of more
12:35 - what we're
12:37 - trying to get to
12:39 - so
12:41 - we got our orbit one infinite linear and
12:44 - what did we do 30 70 oh
12:47 - that's the problem 100
12:49 - we're gonna bring it back around so now
12:51 - let's save that
12:52 - there we go so it swings around and it
12:55 - goes as you can see do you see how it
12:57 - swings wide
12:58 - out here the reason why it does that is
13:01 - because this is where you can see this
13:03 - coming into play the transform origin if
13:05 - i take this out and save it watch what's
13:07 - going to happen in fact the transform or
13:09 - it doesn't even do anything let's say 10
13:11 - pixels 10 pixels just to okay you see
13:13 - how that's working transfer it needs a
13:15 - transform origin in order to for us to
13:19 - animate that transform
13:20 - if i just left it at nothing it's
13:23 - actually it is actually rotating
13:26 - but you can't see it rotate because it's
13:27 - just a black circle
13:30 - so
13:31 - you know you can actually see that it's
13:32 - working so we actually do have to have a
13:34 - transform origin if i did 10 pixels and
13:36 - 10 pixels on the x and y it's going from
13:38 - top and left so it's going to be
13:39 - rotating around that
13:41 - that point so there's actually a
13:44 - tympanus.net
13:45 - tympanus.net i don't really know how to
13:47 - pronounce that uh great website though
13:50 - you could see the transform origin by
13:51 - default is center center you can go
13:54 - you can go top center you can go bottom
13:56 - center and you can do specific
14:00 - points like we did 10 pixels and 10
14:01 - pixels and it will rotate it based on
14:03 - that point as if you put put a pin
14:06 - in in an object and then you spun it
14:08 - around that pin
14:09 - so that's kind of what we're doing here
14:11 - so we want to go back to our
14:13 - 32 pixels and
14:17 - 50
14:18 - and that's gonna allow it to spin on a
14:20 - very unusual axis
14:23 - so that it creates that effect okay so
14:25 - that means we are now on to the next one
14:28 - so let's style the after pseudo element
14:30 - spinner dash 2
14:32 - after
14:34 - and what we're going to do here is we're
14:36 - simply
14:37 - let's copy this one
14:39 - and just change a few of the values just
14:41 - to save some typing
14:43 - transform we're going to make this one
14:45 - 120 so it's on the other side this is
14:48 - going to be a half 16 pixel negative 16
14:51 - pixels and 50 so that when it spins
14:53 - around it's going to do the opposite
14:56 - effect and we can't use orbit 1 because
14:59 - it's going to do
15:00 - it's going to do that which is really
15:01 - weird
15:03 - unusual stuff we're creating here so we
15:05 - need to create an orbit 2 and do the
15:08 - invert
15:09 - inverted version of orbit one so copy
15:12 - that
15:13 - paste it out we're going to call it
15:14 - orbit two and we're going to start at
15:16 - instead of the negative values all just
15:18 - gonna be inverted so
15:20 - if it's a negative it's a positive it's
15:21 - a positive it's a negative so negative
15:22 - 120 now becomes 120 180 now becomes
15:25 - negative 180 like so so now this would
15:28 - be positive and leave those there
15:30 - that should do
15:33 - that should do the trick
15:36 - i might have i might let's see
15:40 - okay so now i don't want them to do that
15:41 - it's actually
15:43 - they're just like
15:44 - they're like doing like a big like high
15:46 - fives or something
15:48 - let's make this one negative 180.
15:50 - they're
15:52 - odd
15:54 - okay
15:56 - those are spinning
16:00 - i like this that we're trying to figure
16:02 - this out together figure out some
16:04 - problems together
16:06 - i
16:06 - at this present moment i'm trying to
16:08 - understand
16:10 - why it did it's doing this that is very
16:13 - odd
16:15 - let's take k let's take out orbit two i
16:18 - just want to see what orbit one is doing
16:20 - orbit one is doing what we want
16:22 - yes orbit two
16:26 - is it start
16:27 - orbit two okay wait wait
16:29 - let's
16:30 - wrote okay
16:32 - i was wrong when i said switch all the
16:34 - values to negative and positive the
16:35 - translate needs to switch so that now
16:37 - orbit two is all positive values but
16:41 - up here we started like this we have the
16:44 - rotates
16:45 - we're going to rotate it the exact same
16:48 - just from the different side awesome and
16:51 - there they are spinning in the proper
16:53 - direction
16:54 - and we have example number one swirling
16:56 - around shrinking as it gets to the top
16:58 - that looks awesome so there we go we've
16:59 - got our css only spinners that are
17:03 - animating and that's just a couple
17:05 - examples you can literally create
17:06 - whatever you want as a spinner maybe how
17:10 - about this challenge for you create a
17:12 - third example a third spinner and make
17:15 - it
17:16 - literally whatever you want it could be
17:17 - a spinning square it could be three
17:19 - spinning squares it could be something
17:21 - that's bouncing across the screen you
17:23 - could you could do whatever you want for
17:25 - a spinner could be very simple very
17:26 - complex very unusual you could combine
17:29 - these animations and do something very
17:31 - very uh quirky totally up to you so try
17:34 - that out exercise some css transforms
17:38 - and key frames and animations and see
17:40 - what you can come up with thanks for
17:41 - joining me today on day number 21 see
17:43 - you tomorrow in day number 22.
