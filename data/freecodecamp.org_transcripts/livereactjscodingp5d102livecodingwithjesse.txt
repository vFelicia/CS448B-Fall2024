00:08 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:10 - with jesse
00:11 - i'm jesse
00:12 - and today is my birthday
00:16 - so
00:18 - this is my birthday stream i'm 33 years
00:20 - old now
00:22 - and my main camera stopped working so i
00:26 - that's why the angle is a little bit
00:27 - weird so i switched to the camera on my
00:29 - secondary display
00:31 - my my good webcam is at my house i
00:34 - didn't bring it into the office today so
00:37 - i'm going to do my best to try to look
00:39 - at this camera when i can
00:41 - but you're probably going to be seeing a
00:42 - lot of this side of my face
00:44 - just because of habit of normally
00:46 - looking here
00:48 - so today i think we're going to do a
00:51 - little bit of coding we're going to look
00:52 - do a little bit of question and answer
00:55 - so i'd like to be done before three
00:56 - because i have a meeting at three and
00:59 - that's eastern time so i want to finish
01:01 - this up
01:02 - maybe in 50 minutes
01:04 - that that would be good
01:06 - uh so
01:08 - we'll probably do about 25 minutes of
01:09 - coding and then the rest for question
01:11 - and answer i'm gonna assume we'll have a
01:12 - lot of questions since we normally do
01:15 - uh if we don't then i'll just keep on
01:17 - coding
01:19 - and
01:21 - oh let me give you an update on my job
01:23 - search so it's been a while apologies
01:25 - for not streaming as much as i normally
01:27 - do
01:28 - and you know what i need to
01:30 - i keep looking over to see the chat i'm
01:33 - just going to move it over right under
01:35 - this camera so that
01:37 - i can see it and look at the same time i
01:40 - see a lot of people saying happy
01:41 - birthday thank you so much wow this
01:44 - that's a lot of happy birthdays
01:46 - i really appreciate that thank you
01:49 - um so here's what's up with my job
01:52 - search i've gone on a lot of interviews
01:55 - now i've done a lot of technical
01:57 - interviews and take-home coding
01:59 - challenges
02:00 - i have received four job offers
02:04 - so of the four offers
02:07 - um
02:08 - i'm pretty i'm considering three of the
02:11 - four right now one of the four is a
02:13 - little bit low
02:14 - so um
02:16 - i've kind of declined it
02:19 - and
02:21 - so then basically there's three offers
02:22 - still in the running but the the really
02:24 - really exciting news i mean i'm excited
02:26 - about all the offers but the news that i
02:28 - didn't think i'd be able to share is
02:30 - that i made it to the next round of
02:31 - interviews with google so i um i took
02:35 - the
02:36 - uh over the phone technical interview i
02:39 - passed it
02:40 - and now i'm gonna go in for five
02:43 - in-person technical interviews at
02:45 - mountain view at their headquarters
02:48 - so i'm just i'm so excited i've been
02:50 - studying a lot now and i'm gonna keep
02:53 - studying
02:54 - uh it looks like i might be out there
02:57 - this thursday so it's not for sure yet
02:59 - but i think thursday will be the day so
03:02 - that gives me a couple more days
03:04 - to to get ready and then there's one
03:07 - other job that i'm still
03:09 - in the interview process for
03:11 - so i need to finish i actually i didn't
03:13 - think i'd have enough time
03:15 - i'd kind of give it up on that because i
03:17 - thought
03:19 - this interview process is going to take
03:20 - too long i'm going to have to get back
03:22 - to these other companies but i think
03:23 - it's going to work out that i might be
03:25 - able to get through that process so
03:26 - there's
03:27 - potentially two more
03:30 - companies so maybe two more offers but i
03:32 - have to get through the process
03:34 - so i plan on making a video of that and
03:36 - putting it on my youtube channel the
03:38 - link to my channel is in the description
03:40 - uh and i'm gonna
03:42 - summarize this whole process and explain
03:45 - what the interviews were like and how i
03:47 - make my final decision so that'll come
03:50 - out after the whole process
03:52 - which is taking
03:54 - even longer than i thought but in a
03:55 - definitely in a good way
03:58 - also uh if you want updates on my
04:00 - interview process i've been putting some
04:02 - updates on twitter so my twitter link's
04:05 - in the description as well
04:06 - but i've been doing a lot of video
04:08 - updates on my instagram stories so if
04:11 - you're on instagram and you want to get
04:13 - those those updates
04:14 - uh check out my instagram
04:17 - i believe i have info about it in the
04:19 - description of this video
04:21 - um
04:22 - so i have i have all my stories saved on
04:25 - my profile under job interviews or
04:28 - something like that
04:29 - so you can kind of catch the backlog of
04:32 - everything okay
04:33 - enough updates i want to make sure you
04:35 - actually get some coding and question
04:37 - and answer stuff so if you have
04:38 - questions about that process let me know
04:40 - but
04:41 - i i will go over it in more depth at
04:43 - some point so
04:45 - uh hopefully i'll cover everything if i
04:48 - see a lot of people are interested in
04:50 - one certain part maybe i'll spend more
04:51 - time on that part
04:53 - okay let me
04:55 - move this i'm gonna move the chat off
04:57 - the window for a second and then get the
04:59 - code up here
05:01 - and then switch over where we at okay
05:05 - here's the code
05:08 - you can find a link to this github
05:09 - repository in the description
05:12 - and you can also find the link to the
05:14 - live version of this
05:16 - uh this site in the description as well
05:18 - so we have a a basically a demo live
05:21 - version of this site
05:23 - and right now
05:26 - first thing i want to do and the first
05:27 - thing we should always do when we're
05:29 - starting up a project that we're using
05:30 - uh git to track is we want to do a get
05:33 - pool
05:35 - oh i need my my uh the power went out
05:38 - yesterday i think and so my computer
05:40 - restarted so
05:42 - bear with me one second here while i get
05:44 - my
05:48 - uh get my ssh
05:51 - uh passphrase in here
06:12 - okay cool so that worked let's see what
06:14 - happened
06:16 - um we got a bunch of new branches from
06:18 - greenkeeper which lets us know when a
06:21 - new package
06:22 - a new version of a package we're using
06:24 - has come out so
06:25 - we got a lot of updates to do at some
06:27 - point we're not going to do the updates
06:29 - right now on the stream though
06:32 - also if you don't want to have to keep
06:33 - typing in your ssh
06:36 - password or key or whatever
06:39 - you can do ssh add
06:43 - and then
06:45 - paste in your key and then now
06:47 - you won't need to do it again for as
06:48 - long as uh your computer is on
06:53 - all right so now that that's taken care
06:55 - of
06:57 - i think
06:58 - okay i'm in sync now it looked like i
06:59 - was out of sync with the video a little
07:01 - bit apologies i know that's that's kind
07:03 - of annoying
07:04 - okay so now we're in sync let's start up
07:06 - our dev server
07:10 - start
07:11 - i've got to double check
07:13 - dev
07:14 - yarn dev
07:18 - some projects it's set up to be start in
07:22 - some projects it's dev
07:26 - okay so we should be ready on localhost
07:29 - let's start a pomodoro timer
07:32 - and
07:35 - let's get localhost 3000 running
07:43 - okay i'm not going to start the ngrok
07:45 - server right now which i'd normally do
07:47 - so if you want to see the site just
07:48 - check it out on the link in the
07:50 - description
07:52 - i'm just i'm not going to start just
07:53 - because we have a tight uh schedule at
07:55 - this point
07:56 - and there we go we have our rotating
07:58 - pictures now so this one happens to be
08:00 - the university president father sean
08:03 - so we've done a bit on the home page i
08:06 - don't remember if if you all have seen
08:08 - some of these updates but we've had a
08:10 - few updates here but the page we're
08:11 - gonna work on today
08:13 - is
08:15 - admissions
08:17 - let's see what it looks like now
08:20 - okay
08:21 - not so great right now right yeah
08:24 - uh so i recently found out that
08:27 - uh the people in admissions were not
08:29 - happy about how this page looks and to
08:30 - be honest with you i can't blame them
08:32 - right this page doesn't look great
08:34 - um
08:37 - we
08:38 - essentially put all the relevant
08:41 - admissions information on the front page
08:43 - and then link directly to the programs
08:46 - okay so
08:48 - although we got all the
08:50 - we did get all the information and where
08:52 - we wanted it to be optimal for people to
08:55 - actually click on
08:57 - we
08:57 - we didn't quite finish this
08:59 - but the good news is we already have
09:02 - a test page that makes us look a lot
09:05 - better so my next step here is going to
09:08 - be to go to github
09:10 - and
09:11 - check out
09:14 - the history for that file because i
09:16 - don't think we made a separate branch
09:17 - for that which we probably should have i
09:19 - think we
09:20 - on the master branch changed it and then
09:22 - reverted it back
09:24 - because it wasn't quite finished before
09:26 - launch
09:27 - and
09:28 - it's it it was almost the same as the
09:31 - home page at the time
09:33 - so we made a decision to
09:35 - revert it back and then work on it but
09:38 - now things have changed on the home page
09:40 - so i think we can just use that same
09:42 - format
09:43 - make it the admissions page and it
09:45 - should work great
09:47 - i see some activity there in the chat uh
09:49 - i will definitely
09:51 - get to read your comments and your
09:52 - questions here as soon as the pomodoro
09:54 - timer is up which will be
09:57 - why am i so far over here
10:00 - okay
10:01 - uh wow i've still got 23 minutes all
10:04 - right so let's go to franciscan react
10:08 - and uh the link to this is in the
10:10 - description if you want to check it out
10:13 - and so i want to go to
10:16 - our pages folder we're using next js so
10:20 - our pages folder uh our actual routes we
10:23 - do have some custom routes happening
10:24 - here so
10:25 - um we're kind of overriding a lot of the
10:27 - default behavior of an xjs but
10:30 - just a little explanation for what this
10:32 - pages folder does
10:34 - and
10:36 - where we got admissions.js
10:38 - okay so
10:40 - for our admissions
10:43 - oh
10:47 - hey we still have this page
10:51 - yes okay cool we don't i don't have to
10:53 - copy and paste anything now i remember
10:55 - what we did
10:56 - okay let's check out here's our
10:57 - server.js file let's find admissions
11:03 - uh let's see
11:05 - okay so admissions
11:06 - our default we set to page right
11:10 - and so it's pulling in the data that's
11:11 - currently in wordpress uh for this page
11:15 - but what we can do is set this to
11:18 - admissions right so this is that custom
11:20 - routing that's overriding the default
11:22 - behavior that i was just talking about
11:25 - so now we're saying if you go to
11:27 - admissions and it's the default meaning
11:28 - it's just the bear
11:30 - uh admissions with no slash something
11:33 - else at the end in terms of the url
11:36 - then we're just gonna have it render
11:38 - this page admissions
11:40 - okay so let's save that
11:43 - we see we're running nodemon so it
11:45 - automatically restarts our server when
11:47 - file our files change
11:50 - so now
11:52 - it'll reload and here we go here's our
11:54 - admissions page so we start out with
11:56 - this hero section all right we have an
11:58 - image there
12:00 - uh we could make this image change like
12:03 - the homepage image does
12:05 - uh we could
12:06 - we could do some different stuff with it
12:08 - basically so we're
12:09 - uh but we have the basic structure here
12:13 - now we have it set up
12:18 - okay yeah now i see why we didn't make
12:19 - this live because it
12:21 - while it looks nicer it's definitely
12:23 - lacking
12:24 - some information
12:28 - i remember now this was a while ago i i
12:31 - remember not
12:32 - having discussions about what exactly
12:34 - should be on this page and not really
12:36 - coming to a conclusion
12:39 - okay that makes sense
12:44 - all right that makes a lot of sense
12:46 - okay so here's what we're gonna do
12:57 - all right we definitely
13:00 - let's take these out
13:02 - and move them to the bottom of the home
13:04 - page
13:06 - and
13:08 - let's move in some more admissions
13:11 - specific data into this section
13:14 - okay
13:21 - all right so we'll go back here and
13:23 - we're going to put on on one side we'll
13:25 - put the admissions page on the other
13:27 - side of the screen we'll put the home
13:29 - page since we're going to be copy and
13:31 - pasting quite a bit
13:33 - both those pages share the same basic
13:35 - layout
13:36 - so we should be able to just swap in
13:39 - pieces and components and they should
13:40 - work
13:42 - if you're interested in how we we got to
13:43 - this point the project this is video 102
13:47 - of the series so you can check out the
13:50 - entire project 5 playlist
13:53 - uh on on this channel on the free code
13:55 - camp channel
13:57 - it's quite a lot uh so i recommend you
13:59 - just skip around and watch the pieces
14:01 - that really interest you
14:03 - but
14:04 - you can if you're interested in a
14:06 - certain part you know you can definitely
14:08 - uh you'll get more info
14:12 - and i'm going to get rid of some of
14:13 - these all right here's our home page
14:15 - i'll move this over here for now
14:18 - and i'm going to get rid of some of
14:20 - these
14:23 - just to make things a bit easier
14:28 - and here's our admissions.js great
14:31 - let's
14:33 - get as much space as we can in here
14:36 - okay
14:38 - okay so our homepage is here and i said
14:41 - i'm going to scroll
14:42 - we're going to go all the way to the
14:43 - bottom
14:44 - and we have this section here that's
14:46 - just we're using material ui as our ui
14:49 - framework
14:50 - and we have this built-in grid component
14:55 - that lets us do some nice nice things
14:57 - with the layout
15:00 - so it within this this grid
15:03 - we have our
15:06 - components so actually we have a larger
15:08 - section here
15:10 - and we're using the grid inside it but
15:11 - this is our cost and financial aid
15:13 - section
15:15 - and for right now
15:17 - i think i'm going to throw in
15:20 - i'm just going to throw in some of these
15:24 - uh profiles
15:27 - let's make sure i get all of them okay
15:29 - so this whole grid here
15:32 - is what we need
15:35 - uh
15:37 - oops let's do some center a little bit
15:39 - too far
15:42 - okay here we go
15:43 - so let me copy this
15:46 - just completely get rid of it
15:53 - there we are
15:55 - and move it over here
15:58 - so this is
15:59 - a section
16:02 - yeah let's do it after this
16:04 - let's name sections with two do's
16:09 - okay
16:10 - let's see how that looks on the home
16:12 - page here oops and we need to import our
16:14 - profile cards that's where we're getting
16:16 - this little red thing here
16:18 - so up here
16:20 - let's take let's just copy and paste
16:22 - this
16:23 - make it a little faster but instead of
16:26 - text section
16:27 - and these are custom components that we
16:29 - built throughout
16:31 - the the course of this project um
16:36 - profile card okay whoops
16:39 - did it automatically add that for me i
16:41 - guess it did oh well i forgot
16:44 - that i had that package so
16:46 - evidently i have a package that
16:47 - automatically adds
16:49 - imports whenever i add these components
16:51 - so
16:53 - that's pretty cool all right let's just
16:55 - check really quickly to make sure this
16:57 - didn't totally mess up the home page and
16:59 - then we'll go back to
17:01 - this admissions page
17:04 - okay cool didn't mess it up it looks
17:07 - alright there i'm okay with that
17:10 - for now i
17:11 - you know i would definitely not want the
17:14 - same
17:15 - uh
17:16 - student repeated over and over again
17:18 - but i'll fix that a different time
17:21 - now let's go to that admissions page
17:25 - and
17:26 - actually
17:28 - oh you know what i didn't
17:29 - yeah i didn't save that that's what i
17:31 - was wondering why those are still there
17:33 - okay so i didn't save it
17:35 - now we've kind of cut this down
17:37 - okay and
17:39 - we have this text of our our mission
17:42 - stuff on the home page
17:44 - so let's actually you know um
17:48 - let's open this
17:50 - twice
17:52 - so that we can see what on the home page
17:55 - might be good to move over and
17:58 - perhaps modify uh for this other page
18:01 - so we have this mission stuff so
18:03 - probably take that out
18:05 - uh but let's see
18:08 - i think we definitely want this cost in
18:10 - financial aid section for sure
18:13 - um
18:17 - okay
18:18 - yeah let's do the cost and financial aid
18:20 - we'll move we'll take that whole section
18:22 - and just copy it so
18:24 - we'll copy that over
18:27 - the people are going to admissions page
18:28 - they're interested in how much it's
18:30 - going to cost right
18:33 - so we'll do we'll put it down at the
18:35 - bottom
18:37 - so let's go back over here and copy it
18:42 - there we go
18:44 - okay so we have
18:48 - did i go too far i did i went too far
18:52 - all right here's where new stuff ended
18:53 - so let's start with this div
18:56 - go all the way up and get this section
18:58 - here
18:59 - we may have to bring over
19:01 - some classes we'll see if we have these
19:03 - classes already
19:05 - and oh what we have here
19:10 - we had some content here that we ended
19:11 - up taking out
19:15 - looks like it off to check that out
19:17 - later
19:18 - all right so after this grid section
19:22 - in admissions
19:25 - we're gonna put this inverted button oh
19:27 - we need invertebrate typography
19:29 - let's see if it if it automatically pops
19:32 - up let's take out profile card now too
19:34 - since we didn't need it
19:39 - oh it's not going to do it automatically
19:41 - now
19:49 - oh
19:50 - okay i guess we'll have to do it
19:54 - or i can just copy it from here
19:56 - integrated button
19:58 - and
20:02 - i don't remember what the other one was
20:07 - typography that was it
20:09 - typography
20:15 - okay so inverted button is a is a
20:17 - component that we made
20:19 - which is based on the button component
20:21 - for material ui actually material ui has
20:24 - their own kind of like inverted button i
20:26 - don't know if they call it that but
20:28 - you'll see what it looks like in a
20:30 - second
20:31 - so newer versions of material have their
20:33 - own since we already had this made and
20:36 - customized exactly how we wanted i've
20:38 - continued to use it but if you're using
20:40 - the latest version you will have that
20:42 - option just on your regular button
20:44 - component typography comes built in in
20:46 - material ui
20:50 - all right let's see what this looks like
20:52 - oh yeah we definitely need to bring in
20:53 - some of the classes
20:55 - so let's do that now
20:58 - let's just check what classes we have
21:00 - going on here so it looks like section
21:02 - inner container section text hero button
21:06 - inverted button
21:08 - alright so let's see what we can pull
21:09 - over
21:10 - in terms of classes and let's compare
21:13 - here
21:15 - let's see
21:20 - section
21:23 - do we have that
21:27 - nope
21:28 - okay
21:30 - so let's go with section
21:32 - enter container section text hear about
21:34 - inverted one yeah all of these down here
21:45 - so
21:47 - we're copying a lot probably not the
21:49 - best way to deal with that all right but
21:51 - first thing is get get it working right
21:54 - then we can make it better okay
21:57 - so let's see if if those styles will fix
21:59 - it yep and that fix it so here now we
22:02 - have our cost and financial aid and this
22:03 - is what i'm talking about with that what
22:05 - i call an inverted button i don't
22:06 - remember exactly where i first heard
22:08 - that term
22:10 - but i'm pretty sure i didn't make it up
22:12 - i think i saw it listed as an inverter
22:14 - button somewhere
22:16 - uh so basically you just have an outline
22:20 - usually i have a hover effect on these
22:22 - so that when you mouse in
22:24 - uh it
22:27 - the background actually would go in this
22:28 - case it would go like green and then
22:30 - this text would go to white so i'm not
22:32 - sure why i did it like this
22:34 - for this one without the hover
22:38 - um okay
22:41 - all right so there we go we have that
22:43 - section now
22:45 - so i'm going to check my time about 10
22:47 - minutes
22:50 - okay so we have about 10 minutes and i
22:52 - think in terms of bringing stuff from
22:54 - the home page
22:55 - there's not really much else that i do
22:58 - want to bring
23:00 - what i think we ought to do now though
23:02 - is check out
23:11 - the old side
23:14 - to see what was on there
23:18 - it's
23:19 - i think it has pretty much the same
23:21 - content that we saw at the very
23:23 - beginning before we changed our router
23:27 - you can see it's
23:28 - the old site's very slow
23:31 - i'm on a really fast connection and it's
23:33 - still so so slow
23:42 - i think this is this is really happening
23:45 - oh you know what
23:46 - i bet it won't even work because for
23:48 - some reason
23:50 - on campus
23:52 - you have to put the www in
23:55 - off campus your you can do it without it
23:57 - it's weird
24:00 - still really slow though
24:04 - okay
24:07 - all right wow
24:09 - that
24:10 - that was so slow okay
24:13 - hey i know her she's really nice
24:16 - um
24:18 - let's see
24:20 - see like uh part of the reason why i
24:22 - didn't bring over a lot of the existing
24:24 - pictures on this site is that they're
24:26 - really old like she graduated
24:30 - oh it's been a while i mean i think she
24:32 - graduated before i started working here
24:34 - so i started working here over three
24:36 - years ago
24:38 - um so she's this this photo is probably
24:41 - at least five years old
24:48 - all right so here's the only difference
24:49 - as to what we have on this page
24:50 - content-wise we we basically have all
24:53 - this content right
24:55 - we had these
24:57 - we had these lists before what we got
25:00 - rid of were some of these old pictures
25:03 - this is actually my boss
25:05 - let's
25:06 - picture my boss there he's a good guy
25:08 - um he's also a good guy i know him i
25:11 - know his professor
25:12 - uh i've been to his house he's pretty
25:15 - cool okay
25:17 - um
25:21 - it really this page is just a bunch of
25:23 - links so i i don't know that we really
25:25 - want to try to copy this page because
25:30 - i mean do we re do we need a bunch of
25:32 - links
25:33 - i don't think so let me know in the um
25:37 - in the chat
25:39 - i mean should we salvage anything from
25:40 - this page
25:42 - i mean we could certainly add some of
25:44 - these videos but again these videos are
25:46 - very old so i might add something in
25:49 - just as a placeholder and then maybe see
25:52 - if we can find a newer video
25:56 - i mean i could see maybe for admissions
25:59 - this video may be
26:00 - you know discover truth franciscan users
26:02 - yeah i mean this is pretty much a
26:03 - general advertising video for the
26:05 - university
26:09 - this austria program is a little
26:10 - specific but it i from what i hear it is
26:14 - a
26:15 - a big bonus for students students really
26:17 - like it
26:19 - i'm hesitant to put up a video about the
26:21 - science programs though uh because
26:23 - that's very selective for just one group
26:25 - same way with theology stuff
26:28 - this these two videos are more general
26:31 - so i think those would be okay
26:38 - and honestly i think this set of videos
26:40 - appears on multiple pages so i'm i don't
26:42 - think this was ever meant to be specific
26:44 - to this page anyway
26:46 - okay so basically we have apply buttons
26:49 - these all take people to the same place
26:52 - anyway
26:53 - um visit campus which we already have
26:56 - that button just to show like we have
26:58 - our apply inquire and visit buttons
27:00 - which are the most important things
27:02 - really on the whole site that we want
27:04 - users to do so we have that we have a
27:07 - link to our cost calculator we have
27:10 - links to our majors our institutes
27:13 - chapel stuff
27:18 - yeah in terms of information
27:20 - like bringing over information from here
27:23 - uh that's the most important stuff
27:32 - so at this at this point i don't think
27:34 - i'm gonna bring any of these other
27:36 - things over unless
27:39 - you know there's something that
27:41 - basically what i i'm not worried that
27:43 - much about content like that's not my
27:44 - thing i'm worried about building this
27:46 - out so i'm not gonna
27:49 - i'm not gonna fuss about the content
27:51 - anymore
27:53 - we could
27:56 - grab some of this text
28:00 - what is this linking to all right this
28:02 - list is online
28:06 - we could take some of this text and use
28:08 - it
28:14 - yeah we could definitely do that
28:19 - all right let's do that let's make a
28:21 - text section here
28:23 - and then
28:32 - i think i'd love to have this quote up
28:35 - here
28:36 - but then i'd need something else for
28:38 - there so i'm going to leave it leave it
28:40 - alone for right now
28:44 - and let's add a text section up here
28:47 - we don't really have anything
28:52 - already made so instead of copying and
28:54 - pasting let's just
28:56 - all right let's do as much as we can in
28:58 - the three minutes that we have left
29:00 - so what i'm looking to do here is
29:04 - get this grid
29:06 - so this is already a grid that has three
29:08 - columns which is what i want so let's
29:10 - grab this
29:12 - let's grab this grid and then just
29:15 - kind of take out
29:17 - everything that's in it
29:19 - and add in some text
29:23 - okay so in our text we have our sections
29:29 - our grid stuff
29:33 - yeah all right let's get rid of this and
29:35 - instead put
29:38 - we're going to put this typography
29:40 - element in there
29:41 - and that's what we're going to put
29:46 - that's where we're going to put our our
29:47 - text content in there by default the
29:49 - typography will just go to a paragraph
29:52 - tag
29:53 - so that's what it'll render to
29:56 - so that should be fine for now we'll see
29:58 - how it looks but when we do it in
30:00 - typography all of our our styles the
30:03 - material design
30:04 - type styles should
30:06 - should work they should just be there
30:08 - okay so we're not going to copy the read
30:10 - more tags
30:16 - i'm just going to copy the text for now
30:19 - and what this should give us is on large
30:21 - screens
30:23 - oops
30:28 - on large screens they'll have
30:31 - three columns
30:34 - one on a small screen they'll stack so
30:36 - it's just it'll just be one column
30:40 - because
30:41 - the majority our target audience is
30:45 - teenagers
30:47 - our primary target audience is teenagers
30:50 - so they're most likely going to be using
30:52 - a mobile device to look at this so we
30:54 - always want to keep that in mind first
30:57 - all right whoa
31:02 - all right something's off about this we
31:04 - definitely don't um
31:08 - maybe we're overriding something it just
31:10 - happened
31:11 - did i forget
31:15 - hmm
31:21 - all right let's see what these classes
31:22 - are doing for this grid item
31:25 - i may have to take that class off
31:36 - okay it's taking out some padding
31:39 - you know let's let's take
31:40 - out all of the
31:43 - custom classes
31:50 - yeah this class name
31:52 - here i do not want because that that's
31:54 - probably
31:56 - the lack of padding is is probably not
31:59 - helping and then
32:03 - i don't know what content containers
32:04 - doing we'll check that first we'll see
32:06 - if this did anything
32:09 - did we get a refresh
32:15 - hmm
32:16 - that did not do anything
32:19 - so let's check on what content
32:21 - containers don't want here
32:26 - with
32:46 - let's check it out in dev tools well
32:48 - let's check oh my timer went off
32:52 - i did not hear that go off
32:54 - uh since i already have this up let's
32:56 - check out the this div is our grid
33:01 - why is this div not giving us any
33:06 - margin or padding
33:07 - oh yeah
33:20 - all right well i will figure that out
33:23 - at some other time
33:26 - we can check it out how it looks on
33:28 - mobile oh yeah it's still it doesn't
33:30 - look good because there's there's enough
33:31 - there's no space i'd want some sort of
33:33 - spacing also this this font size is too
33:36 - small
33:37 - i want that to be bigger so
33:39 - basically
33:42 - uh what i would do here so what i would
33:44 - do up here is maybe
33:46 - i could possibly use the same image i
33:48 - don't know
33:49 - we'll see for now i'll leave that image
33:51 - in there i would change these
33:54 - obviously to make some padding make the
33:56 - font size larger switch this out
33:59 - for something more admissions related
34:02 - and then
34:03 - the only other thing i might think about
34:05 - doing is adding in some videos
34:08 - i think some videos would be good
34:11 - um
34:12 - yeah
34:13 - and then this page i think would be good
34:15 - to go live it's already
34:17 - definitely a large improvement over the
34:19 - other page so in that sense it could
34:22 - potentially go live
34:24 - and still be better than the current
34:26 - page
34:27 - um but for me to be really comfortable
34:29 - with it i would make the changes that i
34:31 - i just talked about first but um let me
34:35 - check my time
34:37 - okay
34:38 - um
34:44 - let's uh
34:45 - let's commit this
34:50 - so we're going to do a git add we're at
34:52 - everything
34:54 - we can do a git status again to make
34:56 - sure so now we have all this in green
34:58 - this stuff is is ready to be committed
35:01 - so we're going to run yarn cm because we
35:03 - have it set up that like a custom
35:08 - little command line
35:10 - program to help us craft a really good
35:13 - commit message so we're going to say we
35:15 - added a new feature
35:17 - and
35:19 - uh let's write a short
35:21 - so
35:22 - a short imperative tense description of
35:24 - the chain so we're going to say add
35:28 - let's see
35:34 - oh we'll say add profiles
35:37 - to
35:37 - home page
35:40 - and content
35:42 - to
35:44 - admissions
35:46 - all right i'm not going to do a long
35:48 - description right now
35:50 - sometimes that's good if what you
35:51 - changed is a bit more complex probably
35:53 - want to enter a description of it
35:56 - we do not have breaking changes so no is
35:58 - the default so we'll just hit enter and
36:01 - this does not affect open issues as far
36:03 - as i know we do not have an issue for
36:04 - that
36:05 - so i'm just going to hit enter because
36:06 - the default is no now it's going to run
36:08 - through our tests our unit tests our end
36:10 - end-to-end tests
36:12 - to be entirely honest we don't have
36:14 - great test coverage right now so
36:18 - i don't think anything that we've done
36:19 - actually
36:20 - would affect anything that's being
36:22 - tested right now we did have tests on
36:24 - the homepage but it changed so
36:26 - frequently uh that the tests were just
36:29 - kind of getting annoying because they
36:30 - would fail every time and we'd have to
36:33 - recreate the test
36:35 - okay everything worked so now we'll just
36:37 - do a git push
36:38 - and that will push it to github so now
36:41 - everything that i've done here will be
36:42 - available for you to check out
36:44 - on the the github page that's linked in
36:47 - the description
36:48 - now
36:49 - uh i'm going to flip back over to the
36:51 - full screen
36:53 - so that i can pull over all the chat and
36:56 - just kind of check it out without the
36:58 - reason i don't like to show the chat is
37:00 - in case someone types something
37:03 - inappropriate in the chat
37:05 - i don't want to be on the stream uh
37:07 - right away i could block it and
37:10 - then
37:11 - uh hopefully like it won't be visible in
37:14 - the chat even in the the replay i think
37:16 - that's how it works
37:18 - okay i'm gonna try my best to keep an
37:20 - eye on the clock
37:23 - let me move my phone over actually i got
37:25 - the new uh pixel
37:26 - 3 pixel xl3 so it just came in
37:30 - kind of excited about that
37:34 - okay i'm starting way up at the top i'm
37:37 - gonna answer as much as i possibly can
37:42 - okay i was just double checking to make
37:44 - sure everything was still going good
37:45 - with the stream status
37:47 - uh does react.js help over normal js
37:50 - while making projects in express what
37:52 - expression yeah express is really a back
37:54 - end thing so
37:56 - uh it
37:57 - you know reacts
37:59 - i think react
38:02 - is easier for a lot of types of projects
38:05 - than normal js
38:07 - or vanilla js as some people say
38:11 - so it doesn't matter whether you're
38:12 - using express or not i think it's
38:15 - it does help okay there are certain very
38:18 - basic projects that were probably
38:21 - easier in
38:22 - vanilla js
38:26 - i guess it just
38:27 - it just kind of depends on your project
38:30 - mohit says is it wise to go from view to
38:33 - react uh is there anybody here who has
38:35 - tried to taste of both i have not used
38:37 - view so i'm probably not in a good
38:39 - position to answer that question
38:42 - all right lots of happy birthdays thank
38:45 - you thank you
38:48 - someone asked if i'm a scorpio yes i am
38:51 - a scorpio
38:53 - i don't really know what that means in
38:55 - terms of
38:57 - what i'm like i don't really go in for
38:59 - astrology that much so
39:01 - uh
39:02 - not
39:05 - i'm not really sure whether being a
39:06 - scorpio is a good or a bad thing
39:09 - um
39:12 - lauren says happy birthday you look 30
39:14 - years though
39:15 - cool well
39:16 - i that since i'm 33 looking 30 is is
39:19 - good i guess
39:23 - hey steven says what's up what's up
39:25 - steven
39:29 - uh
39:31 - sriram says what's the google processor
39:34 - front-end interviews um so i'm assuming
39:36 - the process i've gone through is pretty
39:38 - standard so what i what you'll do
39:41 - normally so i got contacted by a
39:43 - recruiter so my process was slightly
39:45 - different
39:46 - um so i didn't go through the normal you
39:48 - apply process like i talked to the
39:50 - recruiter we already lined everything up
39:52 - and and then i i went to a different
39:56 - i think i went to a different length to
39:58 - apply
39:59 - um and then i also had uh
40:02 - someone referring me uh within google so
40:05 - i had to enter their information as well
40:07 - so slightly different but the first step
40:09 - is
40:12 - well the first step for me was talking
40:14 - with the recruiter
40:16 - i if i had just applied i don't know if
40:19 - there'd be another first step where i
40:20 - just talked to somebody but anyway
40:22 - the real first test was this
40:25 - over the phone uh
40:27 - technical
40:29 - interview
40:30 - so i had to
40:33 - code in a google doc
40:36 - and talk up talk while i was coding
40:40 - kind of like i do on my show
40:42 - to the person who was interviewing me
40:45 - uh it won't really do any good for me to
40:47 - say what the question was because
40:49 - every interviewer will ask different
40:51 - questions
40:52 - so
40:53 - the best thing is just to study for a
40:56 - lot of stuff
41:00 - and then after that
41:02 - the next step is to actually go
41:05 - in person to a google location where you
41:08 - will have in my case it's going to be
41:10 - five interviews that are all 45 minutes
41:13 - long in person where each person will
41:16 - ask me a question
41:17 - so
41:18 - five different interviewers will ask a
41:20 - question
41:21 - and i will have to most likely on a
41:24 - whiteboard
41:25 - answer
41:27 - write out the answer to those questions
41:38 - uh lauren says happy birthday uh from
41:40 - london
41:42 - cool actually i'll be in london
41:45 - next week i'm gonna be at the doc fest
41:47 - conference in munich but
41:49 - uh on my way back from doc fest i'm
41:52 - gonna have really long layovers in
41:54 - iceland london and dublin so if i know
41:56 - anybody in any of those places let me
41:59 - know
42:00 - i'll be in iceland for the longest
42:02 - period of time so like 22 hours
42:05 - uh i'll i'll only be in
42:08 - have a few hours
42:10 - uh to do anything in london or dublin
42:14 - but i'd like to at least see a little
42:17 - bit of of those places uh before i fly
42:20 - back
42:26 - all right sgk asked for a quick rundown
42:29 - of the project is about what you're
42:31 - using at rehab i don't really have time
42:33 - to give a good rundown right now
42:36 - um
42:38 - i'll give the very very quickest thing
42:41 - it's a react project
42:43 - and we're using
42:45 - headless wordpress for the back end
42:47 - we're grabbing the data with graphql
42:49 - we're using apollo
42:51 - with react to help us out with that and
42:52 - we have a custom server using express
42:55 - and node js
42:59 - i mean that's what the project is
43:00 - technologically in terms of what the
43:02 - project does it is a website for a small
43:05 - university
43:09 - and yes it probably is overkill for a
43:11 - website for a small university but
43:14 - uh why not do great work uh when
43:19 - i we can when we can so
43:22 - let's see
43:26 - sriram says what's the goal of this
43:27 - session uh the the channel has a lot of
43:30 - different videos but for my videos my
43:33 - live streams the goal is just for you
43:34 - all to see me doing my normal work as a
43:37 - developer
43:39 - messing up trying to recover from those
43:41 - mistakes
43:43 - and then
43:44 - you know i i just want to try to be as
43:47 - honest as possible about what what my
43:49 - work is like
43:57 - uh mohan asks if i'm using uh es6 yeah
44:00 - we're using some es6 stuff in here
44:08 - um we had a request for translations
44:10 - into arabic
44:12 - um
44:14 - i do not know arabic so i can't
44:16 - translate but if anybody's interested in
44:17 - translating my live streams into any
44:20 - language
44:21 - that would be awesome
44:23 - um
44:24 - i'm sure that quincy you know who's in
44:27 - charge of free code camp would welcome
44:29 - some good translations
44:36 - oh cool steven says inverted buttons are
44:38 - kind of like a logo in a style guide you
44:40 - have the regular logo and the inverted
44:42 - logo
44:43 - right buttons are the kind of the same
44:44 - way you have your primary secondary
44:46 - button and then inverted button airbnb
44:48 - has it
44:50 - okay so cool so it is a thing so
44:53 - like i thought i didn't make the word up
44:56 - it is really a thing to have inverted
44:58 - buttons
45:11 - uh steven says the problem with updating
45:13 - is this colleges really need to update
45:15 - all videos images etc every four years
45:17 - unless you can link that person to some
45:19 - kind of alumni group it's out of date
45:21 - yeah for sure and that's the the main
45:24 - one of the main reasons why i decided to
45:26 - start with a clean slate and not bring
45:29 - over any of the old videos or images for
45:31 - the most part
45:33 - was because i knew
45:35 - if we brought them over people would
45:36 - still just be okay with it right but if
45:39 - i brought them over and they they look
45:40 - at a page that's all text
45:42 - then they'll immediately say where the
45:44 - image is at and people did that
45:46 - some people freaked out were like why
45:48 - aren't there any images or videos
45:50 - well that was the point the point was we
45:52 - can't just be lazy about this
45:54 - and be satisfied with five six-year-old
45:57 - videos you know possibly even older uh
46:00 - and images
46:01 - uh we need to to get new stuff in here
46:04 - and
46:05 - i knew it would speed up that process so
46:09 - uh
46:11 - i still
46:14 - i still stand by that i think that's
46:16 - absolutely necessary we're not going to
46:19 - start a brand new website with old stuff
46:28 - um jenya asked about my visual studio
46:32 - theme i think i have it in the
46:34 - description so it's the seti theme but
46:37 - check the description for uh for details
46:39 - more details on the theme uh steven says
46:42 - your lack of padding is just quite
46:44 - disturbing said in my best darth vader
46:47 - voice that's awesome
46:51 - uh nissar says join late i may be missed
46:54 - but my question is is react changes a
46:56 - lot in life cycle and get back to
46:58 - function component so my question is
47:00 - there any issue with that for this
47:02 - project
47:03 - um in terms of the changes in the life
47:05 - cycle methods
47:06 - no i don't think we have any issues with
47:08 - this project in case you're not sure
47:10 - what nassar is referring to
47:12 - with some of the newest versions of
47:13 - react they had to make changes with the
47:15 - lifestyle life cycle methods
47:18 - because there are some async issues and
47:20 - they're getting ready to have the
47:21 - suspense api come out so they need to
47:24 - fix those issues first
47:27 - so some of the life cycle methods
47:30 - they're saying you shouldn't use them
47:31 - anymore some of them are changing
47:34 - so just be aware of that if you have
47:35 - some older react projects
47:38 - you you may need to change some life
47:40 - cycle methods maybe you want to hold off
47:42 - on updating react
47:44 - until you
47:46 - figure out exactly
47:48 - how it will affect your project
47:58 - sgk asks if uh i was using graphql in
48:01 - this project i am
48:06 - carl asked about the job honey carl go
48:08 - back and watch the beginning of the
48:10 - video
48:11 - uh
48:12 - i would normally repeat it but i have i
48:14 - have to end the video really soon so
48:16 - check out the beginning of the video i i
48:19 - let everybody know about the job on and
48:21 - again uh if you want to stay more up to
48:23 - date on the job hunt i give the most
48:25 - updates on my instagram i also put some
48:27 - updates on twitter
48:29 - uh and i will put a video update a video
48:33 - summary of my this entire process on my
48:35 - youtube channel which is linked in the
48:37 - description
48:38 - after i make my final decision
48:51 - uh umberto says for someone
48:55 - who's interested in going into web
48:57 - development as a career what
48:58 - technologies would you most recommend
49:00 - learning
49:06 - so web development uh html css
49:09 - javascript for sure start with those
49:12 - all right and that that it should take
49:14 - you a while to get good with javascript
49:17 - if you want to jump into some sort of
49:19 - javascript library or framework
49:22 - reacts
49:23 - very popular right now angular is also
49:26 - popular view
49:28 - is a lot of people like vue
49:31 - uh if you would like to get into some
49:33 - back end stuff as well you can use
49:34 - node.js that would probably be the
49:36 - easiest thing to get into if you're
49:37 - already using javascript on the front
49:39 - end
49:40 - uh if you
49:42 - have some specific area you want to go
49:44 - into
49:45 - like let's say you want to be a
49:46 - wordpress developer then you should
49:48 - learn php
49:50 - um
49:51 - you know so just kind of check out what
49:52 - you like and what what you want to do
49:54 - definitely learn how to use apis graphql
49:56 - was great but there's not a lot of
49:58 - people using graphql so you'll need to
49:59 - learn about rest apis as well
50:02 - so that's just a very quick overview
50:05 - uh after clap asks what frontend
50:07 - languages are there how many uh
50:09 - javascript is the front-end language
50:12 - so
50:14 - that's the i know like with web assembly
50:16 - you can use other stuff but like
50:17 - basically in terms of what's used 99 of
50:20 - the time javascript
50:30 - um uso says do you think python is an
50:33 - okay first language to take up
50:34 - programming as a hobby oh yeah for sure
50:36 - uh i would say as a first language i
50:38 - would recommend either javascript or
50:40 - python
50:42 - if you're not really interested in the
50:44 - front end then python is wonderful if
50:46 - you do want to do front-end stuff
50:48 - javascript might be a little bit better
50:50 - because you can't really use python on
50:52 - the front end
50:53 - you know by natively in the browser
51:04 - uh
51:05 - moosa says i really want to do something
51:07 - in programming but i don't have uh any
51:10 - time at all because i've just started
51:11 - medical school this year yeah that's
51:13 - going to be tough uh my advice to you
51:15 - would be maybe try to do just a little
51:17 - bit every day if you could even do a
51:19 - half an hour every day
51:21 - at least it would keep you keep your
51:23 - mind on it you know maybe start out with
51:25 - some free code camp stuff
51:28 - just just do
51:29 - just work on free code camps curriculum
51:32 - half hour every day even if it's 15
51:34 - minutes every day it's still better than
51:35 - nothing
51:38 - jesse you're amazing hi from your
51:39 - russian fans hey how's it going i was so
51:42 - close to being able to come to russia

51:49 - interview thing and so i was i was a

51:59 - conference next year
52:01 - hugo says hey i'm new to react and i

52:05 - way of navigating through different
52:06 - layouts

52:38 - javascript uh i think i just answered
52:40 - that before i'm not i'm not gonna say
52:42 - one language is better than the other
52:43 - but uh it just depends on what you're
52:45 - trying to use them for
52:48 - uh mario says are you moving to angular
52:50 - i'm no i'm not moving angular um for
