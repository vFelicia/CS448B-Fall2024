00:04 - hey everybody uh it's
00:08 - Jesse this stream I'm having troubles
00:11 - with uh with my streaming so that's why
00:13 - it was
00:14 - delayed
00:18 - um I'm thinking this this is probably a
00:20 - pretty bad stream so let me know in the
00:23 - live
00:25 - chat um what it's
00:27 - like so I'm I'm streaming from home
00:31 - today and my connection my my upload
00:35 - connection is not nearly as fast uh as
00:38 - it is like I think my my upload speed at
00:42 - work is
00:45 - like I don't know like 25 times faster
00:49 - than what I have at home so I'm not
00:53 - seeing anything in the live chat right
00:55 - now let me see if
00:58 - anybody's actually in
01:04 - here oh okay I see a couple of people my
01:06 - analytics must be uh lagging a little
01:08 - bit because it said nobody was in here
01:11 - all right so that's that's good uh the
01:15 - um the uh control room and and YouTube
01:18 - is just giving me all kinds of red error
01:21 - messages here so I I kept thinking this
01:25 - wasn't going to work so luckily because
01:29 - I I kind of suspected that my uh my
01:32 - quality of my stream might not be as
01:34 - high as normal uh I've decided to just
01:36 - tackle the load balancing issue that
01:39 - we've been talking about you know for I
01:42 - don't know at least a week I I think
01:44 - maybe we've been I've been mentioning it
01:46 - uh so I figure that'll be easier to see
01:50 - uh than a lot of code so it'll be mostly
01:53 - done in the terminal I can make just
01:56 - kind of blow it up really big and you'll
01:57 - really only have to look at me doing one
01:59 - command at a time and actually not even
02:01 - in the terminal there's uh a lot of
02:03 - stuff will just be done right in the
02:04 - browser so that should be easier even if
02:07 - the quality is a little bit
02:12 - lower
02:14 - oh I didn't even noticed how zoomed it
02:17 - was um Sebastian just mentioned in the
02:20 - live chat that it's really zoomed and I
02:22 - I just checked to see what my screen
02:24 - looks like to you all and it does look
02:27 - really zoomed what is going on
02:33 - um
02:35 - wow all right let
02:41 - me let me fix this because it should not
02:44 - be that
02:47 - um it it shouldn't be that
02:50 - [Music]
02:58 - small
03:03 - let's
03:14 - see let me
03:22 - try let me try switch into another
03:24 - display and see how that looks for
03:28 - you
03:33 - it looks like it's not even it's not
03:35 - letting me
03:58 - switch
04:22 - all right
04:25 - so let me
04:28 - um
04:30 - I'm actually let me uh take a second
04:35 - and I'm going to restart the
04:39 - stream so it might go down for a second
04:41 - I'm going to start it right back up
04:43 - again uh I just need to
04:46 - um I know a few minutes ago it was it
04:48 - was displaying fine and then I just
04:50 - switched from one of my displays to
04:52 - another and then now it now I can't
04:54 - switch back I can't change anything so I
04:57 - just want to
04:58 - restart
05:00 - uh I'm using OBS to stream I just want
05:02 - to restart it quickly and and see if
05:05 - that makes a difference
05:08 - hopefully I've never actually stopped
05:10 - and restarted a stream before so
05:12 - hopefully this just picks up right in
05:14 - the same event and it doesn't mess
05:16 - everything up um otherwise I'd hate to
05:19 - have to start a new event but I'll I'll
05:20 - get it started sorry for the
05:28 - delay
05:50 - okay I think I'm back and I'm actually
05:54 - not getting the errors anymore on my
05:56 - stream
05:58 - so
06:00 - let me know if you can hear me if you
06:02 - can see
06:24 - anything
06:27 - okay working video so uh can anybody
06:31 - hear me now but not see the video or can
06:34 - you not hear me at all let me I'm going
06:36 - to type in the chat
06:58 - too
07:23 - okay so it looks like some of you can
07:26 - hear there's there's maybe like a minute
07:28 - delay
07:30 - uh between what I'm doing and and what
07:33 - uh you all
07:36 - see so so some people have video but no
07:41 - audio and some people said they have
07:42 - audio and no
07:46 - video all right it looks like it's it is
07:49 - working
07:51 - um all right so yeah the uh there might
07:55 - be some some buffering or some weird
07:57 - stuff going on that's just because my
07:59 - internet connection I actually have the
08:02 - best connection that I can possibly buy
08:05 - for my
08:07 - location and it's really sad uh I think
08:10 - my um my
08:12 - Max um download speed is like 25 uh
08:18 - megabits per second and maybe I have
08:21 - like
08:22 - five uh for
08:25 - upload so it's not great um at least I'm
08:29 - it's okay for doing pretty mostly what I
08:31 - need to do for my work but when it comes
08:32 - to live streaming it's not not good
08:36 - so sorry for all that that mess I really
08:40 - should have just scheduled the event to
08:42 - start later a half hour later and then
08:45 - saved you all the trouble of uh of
08:49 - watching uh me try to fix it all uh but
08:52 - at least now now I have it set up so I
08:55 - should be able to stream from my laptop
08:57 - from home now if I need to
09:03 - so all right it looks like uh Paul and
09:07 - the live chat says uh he only gets 10 um
09:10 - download and one upload right so
09:13 - that's I feel a little bit better now uh
09:16 - it's actually crazy I think I pay like
09:18 - um like 80 or $90 a month for the 25 uh
09:23 - upload and I I think it's five download
09:26 - but I really can't ever consistently get
09:28 - over like three uh for download my
09:31 - upload usually rates at like I don't
09:34 - know maybe 18 at the highest so you know
09:37 - how that works you never really get as
09:38 - much as they tell you you're going to
09:42 - get oh man Hamza hza has four download
09:47 - and one
09:49 - upload sorry about that oh well I'm
09:53 - hoping you know like Google or Facebook
09:55 - or somebody will come through with one
09:56 - of their uh their plans to beam internet
09:59 - from planes or balloons or something or
10:01 - isn't uh doesn't Elon Musk want to do it
10:04 - from satellites or something so I'm
10:07 - hoping that works out one day and we can
10:09 - all get uh good internet and there won't
10:11 - be a monopoly anymore from uh from the
10:13 - cable companies so but until that time
10:17 - we have to deal with with this internet
10:22 - so yeah uh Shri
10:27 - Shan sorry if I'm mispronouncing the
10:29 - name it looks like Shon says the 4G is
10:33 - faster than the home network that's how
10:34 - my network used to be and when I
10:37 - realized it when I did speed tests on my
10:39 - 4G and on my home network and I realized
10:41 - my 4G was faster that was like the last
10:44 - draw and then I I called and just said
10:47 - what's the fastest I can get uh and that
10:49 - was it uh so now now I have faster it
10:53 - just seemed crazy to me that I'm a web
10:55 - developer and I I would have uh internet
10:59 - that was slower than than 4G
11:02 - so all right so enough about the
11:06 - internet let's
11:09 - um let's get get to
11:12 - work wow this must be a popular topic so
11:15 - I I posted on Twitter right when I
11:17 - started that I was going to do this and
11:19 - um my phone just keeps vibrating uh
11:23 - almost non-stop with uh people on on
11:26 - Twitter liking that so that's really
11:28 - cool I mean maybe we'll get some new
11:29 - viewers um that we haven't had before
11:31 - this is kind of a different topic it's
11:33 - not exactly like web development we're
11:35 - not going to be working with code we're
11:37 - going to be doing load balancing
11:39 - so uh I do want to let you know
11:41 - yesterday um someone I forget who but
11:45 - someone had asked about um see getting
11:49 - access to the Trello board that I use uh
11:52 - for this project so I um I did do that I
11:56 - so I made it public and I put the link
11:59 - to the board in the
12:00 - description for this video and for
12:03 - yesterday's video so this is the trell
12:05 - board that I was using so now you can
12:08 - see it is public so you can check it
12:11 - out I don't know if you guys can hear
12:13 - that vibrating but it's
12:15 - like it's it's a lot I I normally don't
12:18 - get that many interactions
12:21 - uh when I when I announc I'm going to do
12:23 - something on Twitter so um anyway you
12:27 - can check out that board and just kind
12:29 - of see like get an idea for how I manage
12:32 - my projects with Trello and what I still
12:35 - have left to do and what I've done and
12:36 - you'll get a good idea for how long it's
12:39 - taken me to do it so just to bring it
12:42 - back quickly if you want if you're going
12:44 - to check out the Trello board uh these
12:46 - little things they're not really
12:48 - explained here so I'll explain them
12:49 - right now the dark blue is how many
12:52 - Pomodoro sessions I estimated that that
12:55 - would take the light blue is how many it
12:57 - actually took
12:59 - so if you're checking out these tasks
13:01 - and wondering you know what went into
13:02 - that that that's it each Pomodoro
13:05 - session is 25
13:07 - minutes
13:08 - so it can also give you an idea for how
13:12 - long things took or you know you could
13:14 - you could figure out if I'm a fast
13:16 - worker or a slow worker I don't really
13:18 - know if I'm fast or slow I don't I've
13:20 - never compared myself to anybody else
13:22 - but
13:24 - um uh but you all requested that so
13:28 - that's a ailable to you
13:31 - now so yesterday we did have some some
13:35 - discussion in the live chat about load
13:37 - balancing and what we need to do it so I
13:40 - uh since I'm on digital ocean already so
13:43 - the site is hosted on a droplet on
13:45 - digital
13:47 - ocean I uh decided like well why don't I
13:49 - just see if digital ocean has a tutorial
13:52 - already on it you know they have pretty
13:54 - good documentation for a lot of things
13:56 - so I checked and at first I found some
13:58 - really old tutorials from like 2012 and
14:02 - I I was not really comfortable using
14:04 - that because I'm sure a lot has changed
14:06 - and uh so then finally I found one from
14:09 - uh
14:11 - 2017 and that's the one that I'm going
14:16 - to use so I linked to it it's in the
14:18 - description so if you want to follow
14:21 - along uh you can check it out as well um
14:25 - if you tuned in for the video where I
14:27 - set up like the SS certificate and the
14:29 - servers initially this is probably going
14:31 - to be similar to that so if you thought
14:33 - that was super boring I'm sorry maybe
14:35 - you might want to um do something else
14:37 - or while you're watching this in the
14:39 - background uh but if you were interested
14:42 - in that then this this would be a good
14:44 - video for you so not really frontend
14:47 - something I would consider front-end
14:49 - development which is what I normally do
14:51 - um this I guess you would consider this
14:54 - more on uh the backend uh side of things
14:56 - or maybe devops I'm not sure exact
14:58 - exactly where it would fall um but this
15:02 - is the
15:03 - um this is the instructions that we're
15:06 - going to going to be going off of so
15:08 - sometime recently So within the last I
15:11 - don't know six months or so I I I
15:15 - vaguely remember getting an email or
15:17 - something from digital ocean saying that
15:18 - they were including load balancing and I
15:21 - had forgotten that until I went to look
15:23 - this up uh earlier
15:25 - today
15:27 - so I'm going to follow this I
15:30 - don't they're doing it for three I don't
15:33 - need three I'm only going to set up two
15:35 - droplets so here's the plan the first
15:37 - step is clone my droplet or what I I
15:40 - forget what it's called in digital ocean
15:42 - terminology but the first step's going
15:44 - to be I need a copy of my my droplet
15:47 - running to test it uh we might actually
15:50 - at First just do like two new droplets
15:52 - so we can test the load balancing
15:53 - between those two before I actually move
15:57 - like the real site on onto the load
15:59 - balancer and and because we'll need to
16:00 - point the IP address and everything so
16:03 - before I do that let's let's create two
16:07 - droplets and uh if I can create these if
16:10 - I can just like copy these that'll
16:12 - probably be the fastest way to do it uh
16:14 - copy them get them up and running and
16:16 - then we'll set up the load balancer
16:18 - between those two see if it works we'll
16:21 - point I I think I'm going to even go so
16:23 - far as to point a
16:25 - domain to the uh to the load balance
16:29 - we definitely need to be careful to make
16:30 - sure the SSL still works so that's
16:32 - that's going to be something uh we need
16:33 - to remember to
16:35 - test um and
16:38 - then if it all works and everything's
16:41 - good
16:42 - then we'll uh take down one of the
16:44 - droplets because I don't need three
16:46 - droplets and we'll move the live droplet
16:49 - into the load balancer and at the same
16:51 - time we will point the actual domain for
16:54 - the website to the IP address for the
16:56 - load balancer and not not for the
16:58 - droplets themselves then the load
17:01 - balancer will take care of uh the
17:03 - balancing between the droplets it'll
17:06 - just uh direct traffic to either one
17:09 - unless it detects that one is down I
17:11 - think it's by default it's going to
17:12 - check every 10 seconds to see if one is
17:15 - up and if if it detects that your drop
17:19 - one of the droplets is down it'll just
17:20 - direct everything to the other one and
17:22 - that's perfect that's exactly what we
17:23 - want because when we have one down
17:25 - because we're updating it or if if
17:28 - something crazy would happen it actually
17:29 - did you know legitimately go down for
17:33 - some problem then it would direct it to
17:35 - the other one then once we have the
17:39 - first one back online we'll switch to
17:40 - the other one and update that so it'll
17:41 - be one extra step for updating but for
17:46 - that extra step we will be gaining
17:48 - basically zero downtime for our site
17:50 - which is awesome because uh I think I
17:52 - mentioned yesterday that we have
17:54 - somewhere between 30 seconds and 45
17:56 - seconds of downtime which is mitigated
17:58 - by the fact that we're doing some
17:59 - aggressive caching um even some some
18:03 - client side things with the Ser service
18:05 - worker so most people don't actually
18:08 - feel that full 45 seconds of downtime
18:10 - but I still would rather not have
18:16 - it oh I just checked the live chat let
18:19 - me check the live chat just quickly
18:20 - before we get started just see if
18:22 - there's any questions if I need to
18:23 - clarify anything and then we'll get into
18:25 - it I expect that this will be a little
18:27 - bit of a longer video one because I
18:29 - wasted the first 20 minutes just trying
18:31 - to get this set up um and if you're just
18:34 - joining me uh sorry about the delay I'm
18:37 - streaming from a different computer and
18:39 - a different location than I normally do
18:41 - so the setup was a little weird uh and
18:44 - uh had some unexpected
18:47 - problems uh
18:50 - so I'm going to check this out it looks
18:53 - like uh so I don't know how to pronounce
18:56 - it q n o x uh um I'm I'm pretty sure
18:59 - that's not really somebody's name if it
19:02 - is let me know how to pronounce that but
19:05 - uh they mentioned that digital ocean
19:07 - retweeted My Stream call out so I did
19:09 - tag digital ocean in uh the Tweet so
19:12 - that explains why I was getting uh so
19:15 - many retweets and likes on that so
19:17 - thanks thanks for letting me know I
19:19 - didn't want to take the time to actually
19:20 - look at my Twitter and figure that out
19:22 - during the video because that would not
19:24 - be helpful for you all I'm sure
19:27 - everybody knows how to use Twitter here
19:28 - and doesn't doesn't need me to
19:30 - demonstrate
19:31 - that
19:33 - um all right so let me
19:35 - check there's not a whole lot in the
19:38 - live stream so this should just take a
19:40 - minute uh after I check the live stream
19:43 - here then I'm GNA kind of leave it alone
19:45 - for a little bit and and get to
19:49 - work um the random shots says nice
19:53 - website just checked out the site thank
19:55 - you uh I appreciate that thanks for
19:56 - checking it out and uh
19:58 - I'm glad you liked
20:00 - it uh also has a question what best La
20:03 - what's the best laptop spec for web
20:05 - developer should I get a Macbook um okay
20:08 - so there are some people already
20:11 - answered that as in terms of laptops uh
20:14 - if you want my opinion I currently am on
20:16 - a MacBook Pro I think it's like a 2015
20:19 - model MacBook Pro so it was the last one
20:21 - that still had an HDMI port uh which is
20:25 - which is why I wanted it it has like the
20:27 - base specs there not I don't think I got
20:30 - the upgraded Ram or anything like that
20:33 - so I I actually can't even remember I
20:35 - think maybe I'm running like eight eight
20:37 - Mega uh or I'm sorry eight uh gigs of
20:41 - RAM uh so I wish now that I actually got
20:45 - a bigger hard drive but at the time uh I
20:49 - I didn't want to spend a ton of money on
20:51 - a new uh laptop and I just went with a
20:54 - refurbished one so if I was going to get
20:57 - a new laptop top so I I totally I like
21:00 - my MacBook it's great the display is
21:02 - really nice it's the the retina display
21:04 - it's like 2K uh the um the touchpad is
21:07 - the nicest touchpad that I've ever um
21:10 - seen on a laptop that I've ever used so
21:13 - I really like that and I like that it
21:15 - matches you know all the touchpad uh
21:18 - shortcuts and motions that I use match
21:21 - my work computer which is an
21:24 - iMac uh and I use the magic like
21:26 - touchpad thing with that so so that's
21:29 - cool but if my next computer is going to
21:31 - be a Linux computer uh so I have uh
21:36 - desktop PCS I have a Chromebook uh
21:40 - Macbook so I have a lot of other stuff
21:42 - so I don't if I need to use those I have
21:45 - them so I think I'm going to go with
21:47 - Linux uh I actually just read a good
21:50 - article I don't say just maybe it was
21:52 - like two months ago or something but I
21:53 - read an article about the best uh
21:56 - laptops for Developers that that run
21:59 - lenux so I can't remember what that was
22:02 - sorry about that uh I can't I can't even
22:05 - remember where I read it from so maybe
22:07 - if I if I remember during the stream
22:09 - I'll I'll let you
22:11 - know but I would go with that uh simply
22:14 - because I'm get starting to get used to
22:16 - Linux stuff using it on servers uh I the
22:21 - Linux commands are like pretty much for
22:23 - the command line are like the same as
22:25 - for Mac so you have the same stuff for a
22:28 - PC it's a little bit different so I
22:30 - would kind of like to keep that the same
22:33 - I with with the ransomware stuff that's
22:36 - been going around like I've never gotten
22:37 - ransomware and I'm pretty careful uh
22:40 - about things on the internet so I'm not
22:41 - really worried about it but it's nice
22:43 - that you know Linux wasn't affected Mac
22:46 - wasn't either for that reason so uh
22:49 - anyway hopefully I answered your
22:51 - question I I know I didn't give anything
22:53 - specific but uh there's also
22:56 - just uh kind of a factor for me of Linux
23:00 - is the only operating the major
23:01 - operating system that I don't have yet
23:04 - you know I have mac I have PC I have
23:06 - Chrome OS so it would be cool to just
23:08 - have Linux so that I could have all the
23:11 - different environments that I you know
23:13 - that that 99% of people in the world are
23:16 - using for their machines so it that
23:18 - would be kind of cool to have to have
23:20 - experience with all of
23:22 - them uh all right let me scroll
23:26 - down a lot of this is
23:29 - just you all um letting me know that the
23:33 - stream's either working or not working
23:35 - all right Sky VD asks show us some CSS
23:37 - coding uh today there's probably not
23:39 - going to be any CSS so I'm sorry about
23:42 - that but normally there is CSS so uh
23:45 - almost every time I stream I think we've
23:48 - done at least some CSS so we're going to
23:50 - get back to that uh I definitely have on
23:53 - my my Trello board on my list of to-dos
23:56 - there's a ton of stuff in there that
23:57 - will will require some CSS so I'm going
23:59 - to be doing that uh just not today so uh
24:03 - check me out a different day uh uh
24:06 - usually 2 pm Eastern Time Monday through
24:09 - Friday uh if I'm going to be doing it at
24:11 - a different time I will um I'll put that
24:14 - on Twitter and you know I'll schedule
24:16 - the time uh on the free code Camp
24:19 - channel so so you'll know about
24:22 - it
24:26 - um mark says new to free code Camp how
24:30 - good the content from here is compared
24:32 - to different not free content like
24:34 - Udacity um I'm I'm sure you probably uh
24:37 - got some answers from people in the
24:38 - Stream but uh Marcus that's it my
24:41 - brother's name is is Marcus so uh I like
24:44 - that name um I've done a lot of stuff
24:48 - from Udacity and from free code Camp uh
24:50 - Udacity has some some good stuff some of
24:53 - their stuff is really
24:56 - um it's advanced and very like specific
24:59 - so you'll have a course that'll be
25:00 - specific to one you know particular
25:03 - topic or n free code Camp covers like a
25:06 - lot of what you need for front end and
25:08 - back end and it's not like a very deep
25:11 - dive into one particular topic uh so I
25:14 - would say if you're just beginning
25:17 - you'll probably be better off starting
25:18 - with free code camp and then
25:20 - supplementing with some things from
25:22 - Udacity uh but there are some things in
25:24 - Udacity that I would definitely go with
25:26 - like the Linux basic
25:28 - and the uh git and GitHub course you
25:30 - know go with that right off the bat uh
25:33 - because that'll that'll help you out and
25:35 - as far as I know that's not covered in
25:38 - free code cam at least um the last time
25:41 - I was I was in free code Cam doing some
25:43 - things that wasn't really covered so uh
25:47 - I actually use both I I haven't done any
25:50 - training recently uh which kind of
25:53 - stinks I I like to I like to do a little
25:56 - bit you know every I'd love to be able
25:59 - to do it every day but I can't always so
26:01 - uh but when I was doing it I was
26:03 - actually going back and forth between
26:05 - free code camp and mainly Udacity there
26:07 - are some other things like uh like the
26:10 - you don't know JS book that I was going
26:12 - through so uh but that's that's what I
26:15 - recommend and I think in terms of
26:17 - quality free code Camp is good quality
26:19 - I've done a lot of different free um and
26:24 - mostly free resources I haven't I
26:26 - haven't done paid I mean done Udacity
26:28 - but that can be a paid resource but I
26:30 - didn't I just did the free version of it
26:33 - so um I would say quality-wise it
26:35 - definitely Compares it just it depends
26:37 - on what you really need to learn uh and
26:40 - what you what you want to
26:42 - learn all right so let
26:45 - me I want to get to this so I'm just
26:48 - going to kind of skip a little
26:51 - bit Sebastian your name did change to
26:53 - Sebastian in the live stream so uh
26:59 - awesome okay so I'm going to cut it off
27:01 - there and as far as looking at the live
27:04 - stream so at the end when I'm done I'll
27:06 - come back and check out what I missed
27:08 - but now I want to get to work because um
27:12 - we're we're pretty far in uh into the
27:14 - stream now we haven't done very much
27:16 - load balancing all right so the first
27:18 - thing we're going to do is clone our
27:21 - droplets so let me go back to
27:25 - droplets I've never actually cled to
27:27 - drop it like in the same account like
27:30 - I've made a snapshot and then transfer
27:33 - the snapshot to somebody else uh to a
27:35 - client
27:37 - account uh so let's
27:40 - see let's see how we do
27:44 - this or I can I can uh try it the
27:48 - smarter way and just look up how to
27:51 - clone a
27:56 - drop
27:58 - or if somebody in the live um chat has
28:01 - done this
28:04 - um let me
28:13 - know and uh taking five minutes to
28:16 - figure out how to do this is going to
28:17 - save us a lot of time because otherwise
28:20 - we would actually have to set up
28:21 - droplets uh you know
28:26 - manually
28:39 - okay it looks like we can just take a
28:41 - snapshot
28:44 - and and then make droplets based on that
28:47 - snapshot so let's let's try that so I've
28:50 - done that
28:55 - before okay Bart just said the same
28:57 - thing in live chat so
28:59 - thanks uh let's um let's do that
29:09 - snapshot yeah I'm not I'm not going to
29:11 - power it down I don't want to power down
29:13 - the live site I'm just going to take my
29:14 - chances uh with this and hopefully uh it
29:19 - it will all
29:26 - work
29:38 - maybe I should have powered it
29:50 - down I don't remember how long this took
29:53 - the last time I did it uh does it seem
29:55 - normal that it's taking this long
30:02 - there's not really an option to cancel
30:04 - it so I guess we have to
30:07 - wait all
30:10 - right yeah I'm seeing uh I'm seeing some
30:12 - new names in the live chat so uh welcome
30:15 - if this is you know your first time
30:17 - watching or maybe just your first time
30:18 - chatting uh thanks for joining
30:21 - in uh if you haven't joined before uh
30:24 - I'll just let you know kind of while
30:26 - we're waiting for this to work
30:28 - um this this channel is uh this this not
30:32 - the channel itself but this particular
30:33 - show on this channel is pretty much just
30:37 - me doing my my everyday job as a
30:39 - front-end developer and it's not
30:42 - rehearsed and mistakes are are
30:44 - definitely included I'm I don't claim to
30:47 - be an expert in anything so feel free to
30:50 - uh correct me in the live chat or in the
30:53 - comments uh in the video if you if you
30:56 - notice I did something wrong or if you
30:58 - have some suggestions for me uh that
31:00 - would be awesome uh I often have people
31:04 - uh give me a suggestion and it ends up
31:06 - helping me out a lot so hopefully uh we
31:09 - all learn something from this uh I hope
31:12 - you get something out of it and I know
31:14 - I'm definitely getting uh some something
31:17 - out of this as well uh you know a lot of
31:19 - a lot of help and encouragement from you
31:23 - all so I'm getting impatient with this
31:30 - um all right finally I'm glad it did
31:33 - something I was like just about to
31:35 - refresh the page and I'm not
31:37 - sure I'm not sure if I would have messed
31:39 - anything up if I did that I mean digital
31:41 - Ocean's pretty pretty on top of things
31:44 - so I'm I'm sure that they've thought of
31:46 - what happens if some somebody
31:48 - refreshes all right so we got a snapshot
31:52 - created so we should be able to create a
31:55 - droplet from the snapshot yep
31:57 - so let's create a
32:05 - droplet yeah uh Thor said you should
32:08 - have shut down your droplet I know it
32:10 - says you should have shut it down I just
32:11 - didn't want to take the extra like three
32:14 - seconds to shut it down I probably
32:15 - should have so we'll find out really
32:17 - quickly here if if it messed anything up
32:20 - but at least for the purposes of this
32:22 - test if I can just get my my node server
32:26 - uh up and running that's all I need if
32:29 - it's messed up I can fix it later uh but
32:32 - I really just need two droplets uh with
32:36 - something up and running even if it was
32:38 - just hello world uh but since we already
32:41 - had this ready I figured you know why
32:42 - not just clone the the actual droplet so
32:46 - I want to make sure that I get on the
32:49 - same data center I did read through the
32:52 - instructions that I showed you earlier
32:55 - the um uh the digital ocean instruction
32:58 - instructions for load
33:00 - balancing
33:01 - and at some point it mentioned having
33:04 - them on the same uh the same data center
33:07 - so I want to make sure I do that I want
33:09 - to double
33:11 - [Music]
33:13 - check what data center my original
33:17 - droplet is on so this doesn't cause
33:19 - problems later
33:21 - on nyc2 okay that's what I thought uh
33:25 - but good to good to double check
33:28 - uh we definitely want $5
33:30 - [Music]
33:31 - ones
33:34 - and let's see can I make two yeah I yeah
33:39 - awesome I can make two droplets
33:42 - so I'm just going to name
33:44 - these
33:46 - oops can I all
33:50 - right two and three awesome uh two and
33:54 - three uh yeah I definitely want to add
33:57 - add my SSH keys and these are the keys
34:00 - for um one of the people that I work
34:02 - with and I'm going to add those too CU
34:04 - you know I might get hit by a car or
34:06 - something and somebody else needs to be
34:07 - able to get into
34:09 - this hopefully that doesn't happen but
34:11 - maybe I'm also going to set up
34:13 - monitoring I I forgot to do that on my
34:15 - first droplet you could always set it up
34:17 - later on but uh it's easier just to
34:19 - check that box let me think do I need
34:23 - anything
34:25 - else
34:28 - I don't think I need anything did I set
34:32 - up I did set this I just want to try to
34:34 - make this as close as possible to my
34:35 - original droplet so I think I set that
34:38 - up
34:42 - and I don't tell you truth I'm not sure
34:45 - if I need private networking or not but
34:48 - that's something that like droplet to
34:50 - droplet
34:51 - networking that seems like that has
34:54 - something to do with load balancing so
34:56 - I'm just going to check it it shouldn't
34:59 - mess anything up and better to just have
35:01 - it even if I don't need it I guess uh
35:05 - all right
35:11 - so that's everything looks good I
35:17 - should oh okay Thor says it shouldn't
35:19 - matter for load balancing all right so
35:22 - it won't mess anything up all right cool
35:24 - so uh I'm not g to
35:27 - I'm not going to uncheck it I definitely
35:29 - believe you Thor uh I'm just not going
35:31 - to uncheck it because you know why take
35:33 - another step if it doesn't really matter
35:34 - and who knows maybe I will use it
35:39 - someday all right so these are being
35:53 - created hopefully this uh doesn't take
35:56 - too long
36:08 - okay uh
36:09 - Thor um Thor in the live chat says um it
36:14 - will add an additional uh interface uh
36:17 - so since I check that uh for the
36:19 - droplets to be um to enable private
36:23 - networking awesome good to go you're
36:25 - awesome that's I like digital ocean look
36:27 - at that they just told me I'm awesome
36:30 - that's that's nice I mean I know that's
36:32 - autogenerated but at some point some
36:35 - developer uh thought it would be nice to
36:37 - tell people they're awesome so I
36:38 - appreciate
36:41 - that uh all right so now we can actually
36:44 - get into the part
36:48 - about load
36:50 - balancing I guess maybe we should
36:52 - actually start these servers first
36:55 - so yeah let's start the servers first
36:59 - and make sure that they're actually
37:01 - working so I'm going
37:03 - [Music]
37:06 - to ssh in and hopefully everything
37:09 - is is fine with my keys my SSH keys let
37:14 - me let me make this bigger because I'm
37:16 - this looks small to me so I'm sure it
37:17 - looks really tiny uh whoa that was too
37:25 - big
37:33 - I'm using iterm is my uh my terminal and
37:37 - uh it does a weird thing when I increase
37:39 - the uh font size just by pressing you
37:42 - know like command
37:44 - plus um it actually increases the entire
37:47 - window so if you can see like the whole
37:49 - window is getting bigger so usually that
37:52 - doesn't happen with every other program
37:55 - uh but sometimes it makes it go onto my
37:58 - other screen and and uh messes things up
38:01 - a bit all right so let's SSH
38:06 - into now I don't know if this would cop
38:09 - would actually copy my user or not so
38:11 - I'm G to I'm going to try to use my my
38:14 - username for my other droplet if not
38:16 - I'll just try to go into root and see if
38:18 - that works and cuz I
38:23 - actually I don't think I ever went in a
38:25 - disabled route like the I intended to do
38:27 - so if you remember when we were setting
38:29 - up the droplet originally the plan was
38:32 - get everything set up and then once we
38:33 - were confident we didn't need to mess
38:35 - with root type of stuff
38:37 - anymore uh we would just totally shut it
38:40 - down and we'd still have be able to use
38:41 - pseudo with with my username so uh I
38:45 - think I copied this let
38:53 - me yes it works so good to know if you
38:57 - copy a droplet from a snapshot it does
38:59 - retain your username uh so you see I was
39:02 - able to get right in with my SSH key
39:06 - right into my user so that's awesome so
39:08 - let's see all
39:11 - right
39:13 - um I'm just going to CD in here and just
39:15 - see like okay that looks good that looks
39:18 - like everything that was on the other
39:20 - one so we should be able to
39:25 - do start actually let me see I think is
39:29 - is it
39:31 - status it's already online awesome
39:35 - so no way it's just hello is
39:40 - online let me go to the IP address and
39:43 - see because uh our our instance was not
39:46 - named hello we did have originally a
39:49 - little hello world page so let's see
39:52 - what's going
39:55 - on
39:58 - no way all right it did run
40:01 - amazing
40:04 - whoa that's that's not at all
40:10 - what how is that all right I'm I'm a
40:13 - little bit confused here and sorry if my
40:16 - my inexperience of this might be coming
40:18 - out but
40:20 - I'm I clicked this one did I click the
40:23 - wrong IP address or are all my redirect
40:26 - and
40:30 - things all right so I had not expected
40:33 - this to happen I thought that I would
40:36 - have to do some extra setup but it seems
40:38 - like everything is copied over and
40:39 - working including uh the fact
40:44 - that it's this is just weird
40:50 - uh because I assume my IP address all
40:53 - right or my domain is pointed to an IP
40:55 - address right
40:56 - um it shouldn't
40:59 - be it's just redirecting me right that's
41:01 - what's
41:03 - happening so because
41:06 - my my engine X um reverse proxy is set
41:11 - up to redirect all traffic is that's
41:14 - what
41:17 - H maybe that's what's happening
41:21 - and I'm going to go back to the live
41:23 - chat and see if
41:25 - somebody's
41:33 - that's it yeah so Thor Thor saying yeah
41:35 - I guess the web server is redirecting so
41:37 - yeah if uh a few maybe like two or two
41:42 - weeks ago or something we set this up
41:43 - and we're using engine X as a reverse
41:46 - proxy uh
41:48 - [Music]
41:49 - so it's possible that that is
41:55 - redirecting
42:00 - the the problem that I'm seeing here is
42:02 - well if this is just redirecting me
42:05 - to to this droplet this original droplet
42:09 - then like how how am I supposed to know
42:13 - one if these droplets are really
42:24 - working oh awesome okay
42:27 - uh I sorry I was saying awesome Thor
42:29 - said he found the channel through
42:31 - digital oan retweeting me so that that's
42:33 - awesome uh I I kind of thought maybe I
42:35 - would get some new people um when
42:39 - I when I found out that they had
42:41 - retweeted me so that's cool so
42:44 - yeah and uh some somebody was asking
42:48 - about am my frontend Dev because I'm
42:52 - yeah so this is not front-end stuff but
42:54 - I do have to do some backend stuff
42:56 - occasionally but normally I
43:00 - am
43:03 - um normally I do front end stuff so I
43:07 - would say
43:08 - that's I don't know like
43:10 - 90% 85 90% of my job I think would be uh
43:14 - front end stuff and the rest would be
43:16 - backend and
43:18 - devops and I'm I'm like totally ignoring
43:20 - the fact that I have to do the uh design
43:22 - work as well so I just lump that in with
43:24 - the front end but we I guess you could
43:26 - separate that out all right so let me
43:28 - bring
43:30 - my my terminal in here and we can
43:36 - check check the your projects pointing
43:38 - the new
43:41 - IP be log engine access
43:47 - okay let's
43:55 - go
43:59 - I know this is the slow way of going
44:01 - through here
44:03 - but I like to see the folders to give
44:05 - just like so I can make a mental picture
44:07 - of where everything's at so the more I
44:09 - see it the uh more it'll stick in my
44:20 - mind
44:25 - cool
44:28 - whoa all right so we have some access
44:38 - logs all right so the uh Thor just gave
44:41 - me a nice command here tail
44:45 - um what's I'm I've never used the tail
44:47 - command before what's tail G to
44:54 - do
45:19 - oh awesome okay good to know just
45:21 - learned a new command Tail list the last
45:23 - 10 lines of the file so you can see new
45:26 - lines floating
45:27 - in
45:29 - awesome I like
45:34 - that and the F will do it live cool all
45:37 - right so I'm just copying and pasting
45:38 - that
45:40 - in no did you
45:48 - mean why is this not
45:54 - working
46:11 - okay so it's not installed by
46:20 - default okay so it's just app install
46:24 - okay d uh this is um Ubuntu
46:36 - 16.04 so if you're watching the
46:39 - recording of this later on uh it's
46:42 - probably a little bit hard for you to
46:43 - follow there's a lot of back and forth
46:44 - going on between the people in the live
46:46 - chat uh and and me so uh sorry if it's
46:51 - hard to follow um I'll try to read off
46:54 - what's going on in the live chat as much
46:55 - as I can so this video is at least
46:58 - somewhat intelligible later
47:15 - on okay so I'm going to try so uh uh
47:18 - Bart in the live chat is giving me a
47:20 - command to
47:21 - install um this this package that will
47:24 - let me read my log files and that will
47:28 - give me um an idea of what's actually
47:31 - going on uh with my my
47:44 - server so I'm going to try to install it
47:46 - right
47:52 - now
47:54 - awesome
47:56 - and I already have
47:57 - it so how do I
48:02 - not
48:14 - uh okay so I'm not exactly
48:18 - [Music]
48:20 - sure why it's not
48:24 - working
48:29 - so let me just let me try this command
48:32 - again now it's still giving me
48:42 - that all right so that's so going to
48:45 - work so let's
48:49 - um so you think should I try
48:54 - it
48:56 - let's try it with
49:05 - pseudo no not not F
49:21 - okay I did not expect this part of the
49:24 - load balancing to give me this much
49:26 - trouble
49:28 - so I mean we're literally on like the uh
49:31 - the step
49:33 - one of of the um of the
49:38 - documentation oops and where did it go
49:40 - there we
49:43 - go okay is there
49:54 - something
49:56 - is there something else that I can
49:58 - either use to read that log or can we
50:01 - think of some other way to just see
50:02 - what's going
50:04 - on would it be worthwhile
50:13 - to set up you can fig the points in an
50:15 - IP and restart
50:22 - it so um
50:30 - yeah maybe it's the config this is what
50:31 - I'm thinking
50:36 - um is there something in my engine X
50:40 - config that I should change now that
50:42 - I've changed this uh and will
50:46 - that will that make a
50:50 - difference should I just take out the
50:54 - redirect
50:58 - okay so Bart says maybe there was some
50:59 - corruption in a core file or something
51:02 - like that uh maybe because I did not
51:04 - stop my server and then make the
51:07 - snapshot
51:11 - so
51:12 - that's that's entirely
51:19 - possible all right I'm going to try I'm
51:21 - going to try this one more
51:24 - time nope it's not saying it's going
51:27 - have anything all right so I'm going to
51:34 - go let's see how I'm going to do this
51:37 - um I need to get
51:42 - to I can never remember where the engine
51:45 - X config file live so if somebody knows
51:47 - offand where that is um and can let me
51:51 - know it'll save me some time from trying
51:53 - to look it
51:54 - up
51:58 - um I don't do it often enough uh to
52:01 - remember it so I always just have to
52:03 - look it
52:04 - up
52:08 - uh here here's my plan basically I'm
52:10 - going to go into my engine X config and
52:13 - exet okay that's where it starts at the
52:14 - ETC
52:24 - folder
52:37 - I think I
52:42 - put I have my
52:45 - um default yeah
52:50 - okay all right so let me
52:54 - take
53:12 - [Laughter]
53:14 - Thor says AR Nano uh what's your uh oh
53:20 - you're right I do have to run it to
53:23 - pseudo another thing I frequently forget
53:26 - I'm going to get out of Nano now because
53:28 - I need to run it uh I can view it right
53:30 - now but I can't edit it unless I run it
53:33 - as
53:38 - pseudo okay uh Thor what what editor do
53:44 - you use if if you say them then you're
53:46 - my hero uh all right Jose Joseph said
53:50 - Vim uh I I've tried Vim it's just like
53:56 - I'm not I'm not good with it yet I need
53:58 - more practice so uh I've seen people use
54:01 - them and and it's it's amazing uh it's a
54:06 - skill that I would like to have one
54:09 - day all right we
54:12 - got we got at least three people in here
54:14 - using them so
54:18 - uh so you you all now are um have have
54:22 - my respect for sure um not not that you
54:25 - didn't have it before but
54:32 - um wow okay so uh Thor says Vim actually
54:35 - has syntax highlighting so I'm I'm sold
54:40 - on it for that reason alone uh all this
54:42 - white texting ano drives me crazy uh I
54:46 - actually sometimes just
54:49 - um uh use filezilla and get my files and
54:54 - then open them in my my code editor just
54:56 - to get the syntax
54:58 - highlighting so let me see what I need
55:00 - to do
55:01 - here uh my my idea here is simply to
55:07 - just serve this stuff on Port
55:14 - 80 right or whatever the default Port is
55:18 - yeah Port 80
55:19 - or I don't I don't really care about the
55:22 - SSL right now I guess uh so we just go
55:24 - with Port 80 and not do a redirect so
55:29 - this is our
55:32 - redirect
55:34 - right yeah if I turn
55:41 - this yeah
55:44 - so let's say
55:51 - I comment this
55:54 - out
55:57 - [Music]
55:58 - and is the server
56:02 - name is the server name something that
56:05 - is required I don't know we'll find
56:08 - out oops what did I just do uh I just
56:11 - switched Windows sorry
56:15 - um okay
56:19 - so what I need to make sure though is
56:22 - that I'm doing where's this
56:26 - stuff this okay so the Root's still here
56:29 - is this
56:31 - in it's hard to tell what
56:34 - um where these brackets start and stop
56:38 - okay so this is the
56:46 - start how about this let's just
56:52 - take I'm going to look at the live chat
56:54 - in a second if if you
56:59 - uh if you're if you're typing in live
57:02 - chat that I'm doing this wrong I'll I'll
57:05 - look in a second my idea is
57:08 - simply This Server block was ending here
57:10 - and this one was beginning but I'm just
57:13 - I'm just going to keep it going so
57:16 - basically it's not going to end it's not
57:18 - going to begin a new one I'm going to
57:20 - comment out this SSL stuff just for the
57:23 - time being
57:25 - um
57:27 - and
57:31 - oops and hopefully I don't do I need
57:35 - this I don't remember yeah I don't want
57:38 - these SSL uh config Snippets
57:44 - so let's see that
57:49 - should that should take me back to what
57:51 - I like had originally before we set up
57:53 - the SSL or at least be close to
58:04 - it okay Thor said I have to comment out
58:06 - the list and stuff
58:09 - too let me go back in
58:16 - quickly oh did you mean this list and
58:19 - stuff maybe that I forgot there was a
58:22 - delay so um it's possible that that was
58:25 - typ before I did that so I'm going to
58:27 - get back out okay
58:31 - um I should really ask questions using
58:34 - the uh by typing in the live chat and
58:37 - then we would be in sync in terms of uh
58:40 - at least you wouldn't see what I'm doing
58:42 - on the screen but at least we could talk
58:44 - back and forth um at the same time uh
58:49 - all right so I need to restart engine X
58:53 - which what is it C engine
58:56 - X I think it's just restart
59:14 - right there's it system control that's
59:18 - it that's
59:23 - it
59:31 - okay now let's try to go to this IP
59:33 - address and see if if I totally messed
59:36 - it up or if we're going to get
59:38 - something so it shouldn't redirect us
59:40 - anymore and it did dang it
59:45 - um okay so how did we still get
59:53 - redirected
60:10 - all right
60:11 - so let's get rid of
60:20 - [Music]
60:23 - these
60:30 - yeah Alberto ask did I restart the
60:35 - server oh
60:37 - shoot Thor mentions uh I used the
60:41 - 301 uh so it
60:44 - that tells it that it's it's a permanent
60:47 - redirect basically so it's possible that
60:49 - this is a cash
60:52 - issue so maybe I just need
61:03 - to let's see did I type it wrong was
61:07 - that who caught that I typed it wrong
61:10 - awesome that's that's a good problem to
61:19 - have okay I didn't all right saying I
61:21 - didn't type it wrong I'll restart it
61:23 - again just to
61:25 - um uh pseudo M CTL r s RT X yeah that
61:31 - was that looks right um all right so
61:35 - let's try a
61:38 - um let's try some things
61:43 - here no that's not I don't want to
61:46 - restart that I don't want to restart
61:49 - this one or I could just try
61:52 - it all right yeah yes
61:56 - progress I got a 502 but that's the most
62:00 - happy I've ever been to see a bad
62:02 - gateway error all right we're getting
62:12 - somewhere all right so progress has been
62:17 - made and
62:20 - let's I assume that I messed something
62:23 - up
62:25 - and that I need
62:31 - to then I need to
62:34 - edit this file uh that I just
62:53 - edited
62:55 - so let me check this
63:02 - out actually do I
63:06 - have yeah so I'm going to open this I'm
63:08 - going to make it big so um uh everybody
63:12 - watching live can see this and check it
63:15 - out and
63:20 - see okay the uh reverse proxy part is
63:25 - wrong that's what I'm uh Thor's saying
63:28 - in the live chat I'm so glad that so
63:32 - many of you who are knowledgeable about
63:34 - this decided to watch
63:53 - today
64:03 - and
64:13 - actually I
64:16 - um I'm check on my other screen I'm I'm
64:19 - checking the
64:23 - um
64:25 - let me see I install engine
64:29 - X I'm checking the setup like the
64:33 - original setup that I
64:36 - used for this uh like when I first
64:39 - tested my Hello
64:40 - World um my Hello World
64:53 - app
65:21 - actually I want to check I'm screen I'm
65:24 - going to check really quick in my
65:27 - server.js file to see to make sure
65:31 - what what port I'm actually running this
65:34 - on on Local Host just to double check
65:37 - just on the off chance I set it on
65:38 - something weird if Dev no it shouldn't
65:42 - all right so as long as my Dev server is
65:44 - Port 3000 but my production is 8080 all
65:47 - right so I was pretty sure that was it
65:50 - but did not want to waste a bunch of
65:53 - time if it was something silly like
65:56 - that so where are we going to at
65:59 - location okay so this block looks like
66:03 - it's exactly the same as what I did have
66:05 - it on at
66:15 - first
66:19 - and
66:23 - H
66:29 - so that's
66:53 - weird
66:55 - I want to run
67:02 - um I just wanted to make sure everything
67:05 - was okay with my syntax at
67:22 - least
67:35 - okay
67:36 - so all right so we I'm getting I'm
67:39 - getting several different um suggestions
67:41 - here
67:45 - so I'm going to check with pm2 again
67:48 - just to see like okay we're
67:52 - running
67:54 - H let's
67:59 - say I'm going to stop
68:05 - that
68:16 - and let's see I need
68:22 - to
68:26 - actually let me do this
68:29 - because I just want to
68:34 - see
68:39 - um I think start let me let me check how
68:42 - I have this in my package Jon here um I
68:45 - think it's just start
68:47 - yeah npm Run
68:51 - start there we go
69:04 - do I just need to be in oh yeah of
69:07 - course that didn't
69:09 - work I need to be in the right folder
69:11 - for that to
69:21 - work all
69:22 - right
69:29 - okay
69:32 - so let me refresh
69:36 - this okay and that was it for whatever
69:40 - reason uh pm2 did start up
69:43 - something uh right off the bat but it
69:46 - whatever it was started up this Hello
69:48 - app um I don't really know what that was
69:52 - or what it was doing going but it was
69:54 - not I guess it wasn't this
70:01 - so yeah
70:03 - so honestly at this point just to
70:07 - continue this I'm just going to leave
70:09 - this here because that's all we really
70:11 - needed to happen we just needed this to
70:16 - run uh so that we can test out uh the
70:19 - load balancing so I'm going to do
70:22 - exactly the same thing that we just did
70:24 - minus all the stuff that didn't work on
70:27 - this other droplet and then we can get
70:29 - on with
70:31 - it so let me grab the IP of this other
70:38 - droplet
70:41 - and let's go
70:50 - in
70:52 - okay
70:56 - Nano
71:00 - and what was that
71:05 - Etc
71:08 - um was it engine
71:16 - x no shoot what was the next one trying
71:19 - to find it I know somebody already typed
71:21 - this in so I'm not even going to going
71:22 - to ask again
71:26 - there we go I think that was
71:31 - it oops why didn't that
71:39 - work there we go and that's that's not
71:43 - we had it in um sites
71:47 - available and it was default correct
71:51 - okay all right so in Nano sorry this is
71:55 - still small on your screen uh I'm only
71:57 - leaving it small because um I'm doing
72:00 - the exact thing that we just did so uh
72:03 - it's just easier for me to see it all at
72:06 - once so we are commenting out this this
72:11 - line and this line we're commenting
72:14 - out this part where it ends that block
72:17 - and begins a new block and then we're
72:19 - commenting out the where it's listening
72:21 - for the SSL and where we included
72:24 - Snippets for the SSL and that should be
72:27 - all we
72:29 - did yep that's all we did so and I'm
72:34 - pretty sure I forgot the pseudo so this
72:36 - is not going to
72:38 - work let's
72:42 - see dang it all right so we're gonna
72:45 - have to not save the changes and I'm
72:48 - going to have to use
72:50 - pseudo this
72:52 - time
72:54 - I told you I always forget that and I I
72:57 - literally forgot it after five
73:04 - minutes all right so let's do this
73:08 - again at least I I'll probably get good
73:11 - at this since I'm having to redo it oops
73:13 - that's not
73:17 - it
73:22 - oops Yeah Nano is
73:26 - not I mean I know we just talked about
73:28 - vim and how I'm no good with themm but
73:30 - it's not really like
73:32 - Nano that much more user friendly seems
73:37 - like uh once you get used to using them
73:40 - people can just fly around and do
73:42 - whatever they need to and then so it
73:45 - seems like that's definitely the way to
73:46 - go if you can learn
73:49 - it
73:51 - okay and that looks like everything that
73:55 - needed to
73:56 - be commented out and now that will work
74:00 - since we use
74:02 - tudo and now all I need to do
74:08 - is go in here and do npm Run
74:13 - start and that should start up this
74:18 - one and we will double check quickly by
74:22 - going this IP
74:26 - address and probably need to
74:30 - refresh
74:32 - oops I'm sure you all caught this I
74:34 - didn't look at the live chat I forgot to
74:36 - restart engine
74:39 - X so let's do
74:51 - that okay
74:54 - now let's see if this will
75:01 - work okay we got the bad gateway so
75:03 - that's what we were looking
75:10 - for
75:13 - oops all right and that's running
75:16 - awesome so at this point we have two
75:20 - copies just a quick recap here's our
75:23 - main site uh it's running and this is
75:27 - fine this has the domain name pointed to
75:28 - it but we've made two exact copies
75:33 - and we've edited the uh config for
75:36 - engine X slightly so that we can reach
75:40 - these at these IP addresses because
75:42 - otherwise it was redirecting us back to
75:44 - this site so now we should be able to
75:47 - continue on with setting up load
75:49 - balancing between these two uh to test
75:52 - it out
75:54 - and hopefully get it working uh on here
75:59 - so let me scroll down here to
76:06 - see see the live
76:11 - chat uh I'm laughing because I just did
76:14 - I scroll down to the bottom of the live
76:15 - chat I scrolled up a little bit to look
76:17 - up a command and uh there are like I
76:21 - don't know maybe 10 messages is saying
76:23 - use pseudo and exclamation points pseudo
76:26 - pseudo
76:28 - so I knew you all caught it uh and and I
76:32 - didn't catch it so uh it's actually if
76:35 - you've never tried live coding before on
76:38 - YouTube or any other place where you can
76:40 - do live coding um I'm it's really nice
76:45 - to have all these people looking at the
76:47 - code when you're coding uh I usually
76:50 - work
76:51 - alone and so I never never have other
76:53 - people looking at my code and at first
76:56 - when I thought about live streaming the
76:58 - thought of other people looking at my
76:59 - code was scary but now I see that I mean
77:03 - I'm sure there are some people that look
77:05 - at my code and think wow this guy is a
77:07 - noob uh but there's a lot of other
77:09 - really nice people like you all uh in in
77:12 - the live chat here that look at my code
77:14 - and offer amazing suggestions and
77:17 - feedback for me and catch my mistakes
77:20 - before I catch
77:22 - them so I appreciate
77:28 - that yeah I will I will be checking the
77:30 - chat there is a delay there's about a
77:32 - minute delay so the stuff that I'm doing
77:35 - you all won't see for another minute so
77:38 - um so part part of the reason why
77:41 - uh uh it seems like I'm not checking the
77:44 - chat is because of that also honestly
77:47 - sometimes I just do forget to check the
77:48 - chat
77:52 - so
77:55 - [Laughter]
77:58 - all right so evidently as I went through
78:01 - and it had
78:02 - uh I I said that you know they were
78:05 - saying pseudo with exclamation points I
78:08 - assume they were just yelling pseudo at
78:09 - me but pseudo with two exclamation
78:12 - points is actually a
78:16 - command so uh I apologize for the
78:20 - frustration that I must be causing you
78:23 - by by misunderstanding what's what's
78:25 - going on here so I don't know what's
78:28 - okay so brings in the previous command
78:29 - and add suit to that line oh my
78:33 - goodness that command is going to change
78:35 - my life okay so this this is um an
78:40 - excellent excellent thing that uh was
78:43 - just brought up here so I don't know how
78:45 - to say this but the users q and
78:48 - Ox
78:50 - so if you're you doing a
78:54 - command with when you want to use pseudo
78:56 - let me let me bring up a window where I
78:58 - actually have I can write in so so let's
79:02 - say you want to do something
79:04 - pseudo uh if you just type in like
79:07 - you've typed in the command once right
79:10 - uh
79:12 - so I don't even know something I
79:15 - could
79:17 - uh trying to think of a long command I
79:19 - could do I can't think of something on
79:21 - the spot that would be long but let's
79:25 - say let's say that I typed in a really
79:28 - long command but I forgot to use pseudo
79:31 - right so I hit enter and I'm like oh man
79:33 - I I forgot to use pseudo instead of
79:35 - having to type that command in again or
79:37 - having to do like I just did where I
79:39 - actually like scrolled back with my
79:41 - arrow keys all the way to the beginning
79:42 - if I just typed in pseudo and then two
79:45 - exclamation points it will actually
79:47 - bring up the previous command and then
79:49 - add the word pseudo at the beginning so
79:51 - I don't have to do that
79:53 - and that is awesome uh that's an amazing
79:56 - tip so if you only get one thing useful
80:00 - out of this live stream
80:02 - today if if it's only that then I think
80:05 - that's worth uh all the time of doing
80:08 - this live stream and thank you so much
80:11 - for telling me that because that that is
80:14 - going to save me I don't know it's going
80:16 - to save me like a few seconds here and
80:18 - there but it's going to add up over the
80:20 - course of time to probably a lot of time
80:22 - and a lot of
80:23 - frustration uh gone because of that
80:26 - command so thank you very
80:30 - much okay
80:33 - so now we can finally get on with
80:38 - actually setting up the load balancing I
80:40 - hope that at least I know there's a lot
80:43 - of people in the live chat and a lot of
80:44 - people watching right now that are you
80:46 - know this has probably been a little bit
80:48 - painful to watch me go through this and
80:49 - you you've already got this down and you
80:51 - know what's going on
80:53 - but I I at least hope that there are
80:55 - some people who have never done this
80:57 - kind of thing before and you're getting
80:58 - some type of value out of this so um I
81:02 - mean hopefully there's some value in me
81:05 - you know kind of fumbling through this
81:07 - for the last hour uh
81:11 - so the droplets are now up and we have a
81:16 - site running on each of them so that get
81:18 - brings us
81:19 - to step two
81:23 - of our documentation if you're following
81:25 - along the link is in the description
81:27 - this is step two so we need to go to
81:29 - load balancers I'm going to move it to
81:31 - my other screen so that I can actually
81:32 - do this on this screen and you all can
81:34 - watch I'm going to make it a little bit
81:35 - bigger for
81:38 - you oops didn't want to do
81:42 - that I need to go here anyway so
81:45 - networking load
81:47 - balancers so now we're going to create a
81:49 - load
81:51 - balancer
81:53 - and create load
81:56 - balancer build hourly at 3 cents no
81:59 - additional bandwidth
82:02 - charges okay
82:07 - so I'm going to create this load
82:10 - balancer I'm assuming that this is
82:12 - within budget $20 a month is not a huge
82:14 - deal and um we're actually saving money
82:19 - um in terms of uh where we were going to
82:23 - host it at before so what was budgeted
82:25 - for uh we're still under that so I'm not
82:28 - too worried about
82:29 - this and if anybody is watching from
82:33 - where I work and you know the budget
82:34 - stuff better than me please warn me now
82:36 - before I purchase
82:50 - this okay awesome I just checked the
82:52 - Stream because I remember you all told
82:53 - me to keep checking
82:55 - so uh let's
83:01 - see okay yeah so some people are getting
83:04 - something out of it and some people
83:05 - saying they're watching because they
83:06 - like to teach and I appreciate you um
83:10 - you watching okay
83:12 - so actually Thor Thor says he never set
83:15 - up load balancing before so you've been
83:16 - helping me out so much in this stream so
83:18 - hopefully you can get something as well
83:20 - out of this and when we can set up um uh
83:23 - load balancing uh Rohan don't worry
83:26 - about it I didn't take offense to your
83:27 - comment so um uh so don't don't worry at
83:30 - all no no offense taken uh Rohan was was
83:34 - he was referencing something else like
83:37 - as a joke but it seemed somewhat rude so
83:40 - uh don't worry about it I'm not really
83:42 - uh I'm I've been pleasantly surprised at
83:45 - how few people have been rude to me
83:48 - since I've started doing this uh so I
83:52 - mean you all have been great I I was
83:54 - actually expecting more people to come
83:56 - in and and be like critical in a mean
83:59 - way so uh don't don't worry about it I'm
84:02 - I'm sure I'm due for some of it someday
84:04 - but uh for now you all have been been
84:07 - awesome all right so we need to make a
84:10 - name for a load balancer so I guess I'm
84:13 - just going to call it ccii load Balance
84:16 - kakal Institute is the uh like the
84:18 - department where I work that I'm making
84:20 - the site for so that's why everything is
84:23 - prefixed with
84:24 - CI
84:27 - uh so I know I'm I'm really unique with
84:31 - my names but
84:33 - um it says what it does so it'll work so
84:38 - we
84:39 - need both we prefixed everything with CI
84:42 - our droplets so this should be easy yep
84:44 - we got
84:44 - two
84:46 - and
84:49 - three awesome so we already have
84:53 - the right
84:56 - regions oh okay Thor says he's when he
85:00 - sees CI he thinks continuous integration
85:02 - so it's confusing honestly before I
85:05 - started this project I thought the same
85:08 - thing CI always meant continuous
85:09 - integration and in the first couple of
85:11 - meetings when people were using CI
85:12 - that's what I thought too but now that
85:15 - I've been working on this so much uh my
85:17 - brain has shifted and now I do think of
85:20 - uh CI as cakal Institute but I'm glad
85:23 - you brought up continuous integration
85:25 - because that's something I'm really
85:26 - interested in so if anybody listening
85:28 - now has any good resources or something
85:31 - that you use for continuous integration
85:33 - please put it in the comments or uh
85:36 - direct message me on Twitter uh I think
85:38 - there's a link to my Twitter in the
85:39 - description uh or you can put it in the
85:41 - live chat because I would love to know
85:42 - what you all use or what your
85:44 - suggestions are for
85:45 - that all right so we need to load
85:49 - balance set how traffic will be routed
85:50 - from the load balancer to your drop
85:52 - droplets okay so for now I think this
85:55 - will work at some point we do need https
85:59 - but but right now our um our droplets
86:01 - aren't using htps so just to test I'm
86:05 - going to leave it like this I'm assuming
86:07 - that I can change this later on if not
86:09 - I'll have to just make another load
86:10 - balancer which you I guess I'll do I I
86:14 - won't do it live I won't make you go
86:16 - through all that but
86:18 - um maybe I'll okay so this looks good
86:21 - let's look at our
86:22 - um our default values so uh round robin
86:27 - um if you're not familiar with some of
86:30 - these uh I'll go through a little bit
86:33 - and I'm not an expert I've just read up
86:35 - on it a bit before this round robin
86:38 - means like it's just going to pass off
86:40 - each session to a different server it's
86:41 - not going to check like the load on the
86:43 - servers or anything like that so uh it's
86:46 - just kind of spreading things
86:51 - out
86:53 - uh Zach asks is this an advanced topic
86:57 - um I guess so I don't know it it depends
87:00 - on where you're coming from I'm if
87:01 - somebody was a backend developer this is
87:03 - probably not that advanced for them uh
87:07 - but for me as a front-end developer this
87:09 - seems pretty Advanced for me because
87:11 - it's not what I usually do I I have to
87:13 - do it occasionally when I first set up a
87:16 - site but then I usually don't have to
87:18 - mess with it again uh
87:21 - so
87:22 - um depends on where you're at I don't
87:25 - know maybe you all have a better um idea
87:28 - of um what kind of the level that I'm
87:32 - I'm working at here uh whether it's
87:35 - Advanced or
87:39 - not okay cool thanks a few people are
87:41 - putting their preferences for continuous
87:45 - integration uh and um cool that's
87:48 - helpful I'll I'll go back after this
87:50 - video um I'll make sure I go back into
87:53 - the uh chat and um check out your
87:55 - suggestions uh I'll look them up and see
87:59 - um uh because I I haven't even heard of
88:02 - some of these ones that you're
88:03 - suggesting so I'm interested to find out
88:05 - what they're what they're
88:06 - like um for right
88:11 - now I guess this would be
88:14 - fine I kind of want to click this just
88:16 - to show you let's let's do it uh so just
88:21 - for the sake of
88:23 - learning I'll just show you these
88:25 - options so it looks like we could do
88:26 - round robin like I said it just splits
88:29 - everything up evenly
88:31 - um this actually kind of more
88:34 - intelligently routes things so whatever
88:36 - droplet has the least load it it goes to
88:38 - I actually kind of like that one
88:43 - better I wonder what the uh if there's
88:46 - some type of performance tradeoff for
88:48 - this as opposed to the other one they
88:50 - don't really explain it but
88:52 - uh I think I'm going to go with this one
88:56 - because I I could see this being of more
88:58 - value um I mean I there's got to be some
89:02 - trade-off with performance or something
89:04 - because otherwise everyone would just
89:05 - pick this one uh okay I don't need to
89:10 - track
89:11 - people so I'm not going to worry about
89:14 - this cookie thing we're not I'm not
89:15 - doing any anything with that
89:19 - currently uh let's see
89:23 - health
89:24 - checks okay so we could actually set our
89:27 - own interval right now it's in 10c
89:29 - intervals
89:30 - so um cool I think I'm not going to mess
89:33 - with that at some point we will need to
89:36 - change this to use https but not right
89:38 - now and we're not going to redirect this
89:41 - right
89:45 - now so right now like we commented out
89:48 - all our https stuff anyway so I don't
89:50 - want to do this now but at some point we
89:52 - will probably set those so let's create
89:54 - this load
89:57 - balancer great it seems like we've just
90:01 - fast forwarded through so much now after
90:03 - that struggle in the
90:06 - beginning so uh if you want to know more
90:09 - about all that stuff that I just we just
90:11 - saw um those options check out the uh
90:15 - Link in my description to the digital
90:17 - ocean documentation for load balancing
90:20 - uh it actually it explains in more depth
90:23 - uh each one of those
90:27 - options all right so now if you are
90:30 - following along as soon as this this bar
90:32 - gets all the way up here we're going to
90:34 - be on step three which is
90:50 - testing
90:55 - okay I'm going to check back in the live
90:57 - stream now since while we're waiting or
90:59 - the live chat
91:06 - sorry okay so some of the continuous
91:08 - integration stuff that uh that you that
91:11 - are being suggested here in the live
91:12 - chat just in case you're you uh can't
91:15 - view the chat right now or you're
91:16 - watching the recording later on uh is a
91:19 - circle
91:20 - CI um
91:22 - appveyor
91:26 - Jenkins I have heard of Jenkins I
91:28 - haven't heard of the other two
91:32 - yet okay so um Sean says in terms of
91:36 - backend uh he says this is fairly simple
91:39 - because digital ocean does all the heavy
91:41 - lifting for you automatically it would
91:43 - be Advanced if if you had to set up all
91:44 - manually yeah definitely when I was
91:47 - first thinking about doing this and I I
91:48 - didn't realize the digital ocean did all
91:51 - this I'm I mean you pay more right it's
91:53 - like 20 bucks a month for them to handle
91:54 - it all but um honestly like in terms of
91:57 - how many hours it would take me to
91:59 - probably set it up manually that $20 is
92:02 - not really a big deal compared to you
92:04 - know what what my company would have to
92:07 - pay
92:08 - me to to set that up and maintain it all
92:11 - myself so I'm I think they're saving
92:13 - money uh by me going this route so um
92:17 - yeah I was a little bit afraid of having
92:18 - to do it all manually I mean it was like
92:21 - fear mix with excitement you know
92:22 - sometimes it's cool to like tackle some
92:24 - big difficult thing but at the same time
92:27 - you know uh there's just so many hours
92:30 - in the day I have other projects so I
92:33 - wasn't sure I'd have the time to get to
92:39 - it uh Alex asks do you recommend uh
92:43 - JavaScript for a
92:45 - programmer he says do you recommend lean
92:47 - JavaScript for programmer I'm assuming
92:49 - you said meant learn JavaScript or is
92:53 - there something called lean JavaScript
92:54 - and I'm just misunderstanding so
92:56 - assuming you're meaning do you recommend
92:58 - learning JavaScript I'm going to say
93:01 - yeah but I mean I'm this is coming from
93:02 - somebody who primarily uses JavaScript
93:06 - so I think most people would recommend
93:09 - that you learn you know the thing that
93:12 - they that they know so the reason that I
93:15 - am going with JavaScript is
93:18 - because uh there are a lot of jobs for
93:20 - JavaScript right now and there are a lot
93:22 - of things being that can be built with
93:24 - JavaScript and JavaScript can be used on
93:27 - both the client side and the server side
93:30 - so it offers me the opportunity to focus
93:33 - my time and my training on one language
93:36 - instead of multiple languages and be
93:37 - able to build apps completely you know
93:40 - front end and backend with just one
93:43 - language so for me it's like it's a
93:45 - timesaving thing of you know I I know I
93:49 - don't have all the time in the world uh
93:51 - to spend learning things so why not just
93:54 - learn one language that I can build
93:57 - complete things with instead of having
93:59 - to learn two different languages uh I
94:01 - have done some stuff
94:04 - with I built a calculator once in C+
94:07 - plus I've done some things with c i do
94:10 - word press type stuff
94:18 - with uh
94:20 - so I've done very very basic minor stuff
94:24 - in other languages uh the majority of
94:26 - what I do is in JavaScript all right so
94:31 - this is now up we're going to check out
94:35 - this IP address now and it should route
94:38 - us to a
94:41 - site and it
94:43 - did it did and I have a big smile on my
94:46 - face right now
94:48 - so technically at this point we've we've
94:52 - done load balancing all right there's
94:54 - definitely still some some testing right
94:56 - I W to I we want to actually stop one of
95:00 - our servers and then try it again to
95:02 - make sure it's it's actually switching
95:04 - the right way uh and then we need to get
95:07 - it working with the domain name and with
95:10 - the SSL the domain name thing is
95:12 - actually going to be really easy and I
95:14 - can do that right
95:17 - now uh I already have a test domain name
95:20 - set up
95:28 - so I'm going to point
95:30 - it to
95:32 - that to that
95:35 - address let me
95:37 - see I'm going to do the login and stuff
95:40 - on my other screen and then I can show
95:42 - you what uh what I'm
95:50 - doing
96:20 - yeah
96:27 - okay all right so let me let me make
96:30 - sure I copy this IP so that I get the
96:33 - right
96:35 - one
96:46 - and I'll bring over
96:49 - um just in in case you haven't seen how
96:53 - to how to work with domains or not I'll
96:55 - bring over this uh screen it's this your
96:57 - screen's going to look a little bit
96:58 - different depending on where you're
97:00 - where you purchase your domain and where
97:01 - you're managing it
97:05 - from uh let's
97:16 - see okay so check this out if you
97:19 - watched I don't know maybe a few weeks
97:22 - ago we we worked with this before I'm
97:24 - going to bring this up just a
97:29 - bit Thor I just checked the live chat
97:32 - Thor mentioned C and C++ not really a
97:35 - great idea for beginners yeah uh I mean
97:38 - I did a good I did well in the class I
97:41 - got a really good grade uh this was in
97:43 - college I took a course on it uh is one
97:46 - of my few computer uh related courses
97:49 - that I took because my degrees in
97:50 - business but uh I did really well in it
97:53 - I got a good grade and I always got the
97:55 - assignments done you know really
97:57 - quickly but it didn't it didn't make me
98:00 - want to
98:01 - do uh any type of programming all right
98:05 - so
98:06 - basically here's our records this is
98:08 - just a list of our this is our main
98:11 - domain right so we have this is pointed
98:14 - to our main digital ocean droplet all
98:16 - right that's live right now it's just at
98:18 - and we're using the a address this is a
98:20 - w ww version so you do have to have a
98:23 - separate www version if you want people
98:25 - to be able to get to there after from
98:27 - typing in www and then these are all the
98:30 - subdomains so we have um our WP
98:34 - subdomain is where our WordPress backend
98:36 - for this site is is living and um then
98:40 - we have this test one so I'm going to
98:42 - change the test one if you remember that
98:44 - used to be pointed to to here it used to
98:46 - have this IP address uh but now we're
98:48 - going to we're going to change that I'm
98:49 - going to save it
98:53 - and if this if this takes a while to
98:58 - uh uh for it to work you know like let's
99:01 - say it's still cached on the other one
99:03 - uh then I'm not going to stick around
99:05 - for that I'm just going to skip to the
99:07 - next part of testing and then if it
99:09 - kicks in and starts working later on
99:10 - then that's great we can we can test
99:14 - it
99:16 - uh there we
99:20 - go
99:41 - maybe all right so I'm just going to go
99:44 - back like I said I I don't know if uh if
99:47 - that'll kick in but at least I have it
99:49 - pointed there so it'll it'll it'll kick
99:51 - in at some point uh if you remember last
99:54 - time we tried to point a domain it was
99:56 - like it was a while it was way longer
99:58 - than I I thought it would be I think it
100:00 - was we waited around for like a half an
100:02 - hour
100:05 - um okay so Thor said it is working fine
100:09 - uh fine there so uh awesome so yeah it's
100:12 - probably just some sort of caching on my
100:14 - end and uh so not really a big deal I
100:18 - didn't it's not like I expected that
100:19 - that would not work that's pretty uh
100:21 - pretty simple so uh so let's just stop
100:25 - one of these servers and I mean
100:27 - obviously it should work but you know
100:29 - let's test it where am I at
100:34 - um soor I'm trying to find my um there
100:37 - it
100:38 - is uh all right so let's go to one of
100:42 - these
100:44 - and I just
100:46 - stopped stop that and let's see well
100:50 - actually actually have to shut down
100:52 - engine
100:54 - X here's what I want to
100:57 - know do does it need to completely shut
101:00 - down or if it gets an error because my
101:03 - node server is shut down will that be
101:10 - enough and I I don't know if I'll know
101:12 - that for sure I'm assuming
101:17 - that it would take an error
101:19 - message yeah so
101:37 - let's let's try this
101:46 - out uh I just uh check the analytics
101:49 - quickly and uh we have 40 two viewers
101:51 - still I'm I'm uh pleasantly surprised
101:54 - and impressed because this has been a
101:56 - really long stream so far so
102:02 - um okay I get Patrick says I get the 502
102:06 - without the node server so that should
102:07 - work okay so that's
102:09 - um that's what I want so it I don't
102:12 - think I explained what I was just
102:13 - talking about properly so uh I was kind
102:16 - of thinking out loud so basically in the
102:20 - um documentation for digital ocean to
102:23 - test this they recommend just stopping
102:25 - engine X to test but that's not what
102:28 - will will happen like for me for this
102:32 - site I'm not I don't completely stop
102:35 - engine X when I update the site it stays
102:37 - running what I do stop temporarily is
102:41 - the node server so what I want to happen
102:44 - is if engine X is still running on a
102:48 - droplet but the node server is down I
102:51 - want the load balancer to go to the
102:53 - other server that has everything still
102:55 - up and running
103:01 - so
103:03 - that's I'm I'm not exactly
103:05 - [Music]
103:07 - sure the only way I know how to test
103:09 - that is to change something on one of
103:11 - these
103:12 - sites and then um then I could actually
103:15 - tell which one I'm being directed to
103:18 - anybody have a better idea I kind of
103:23 - don't I don't really want to take the
103:28 - time yeah
103:30 - um uh trollman or I assume it's trollman
103:37 - uh is says https is not working so yeah
103:40 - that's fine I didn't set up the um
103:43 - https oh the access log yes awesome so
103:47 - Thor says check the access log so uh
103:52 - um
103:54 - that all right so
103:57 - let's I don't know if I even want to
103:59 - attempt checking this access log before
104:01 - since I I failed at it last time
104:05 - um let's
104:08 - [Music]
104:10 - see I'm just I'm thinking for a second
104:12 - like is it worth it to take the time to
104:14 - really change stuff and try to test this
104:16 - now uh because otherwise I will
104:19 - eventually I will actually have to
104:21 - change something like and by eventually
104:23 - I mean like either later today or
104:25 - tomorrow morning I will really actually
104:27 - make an update to the site and then it
104:29 - will be obvious whether or not this is
104:32 - working uh
104:35 - so I guess I could so th Thor actually
104:38 - just gave me the exact command uh so I
104:42 - can copy and paste so thank you for that
104:45 - uh it's definitely going to
104:48 - be easy enough now
104:58 - H pseudo right so let's do I need
105:06 - pseudo
105:12 - nice oh wow okay and then
105:16 - shift
105:19 - okay
105:27 - all right so this is telling me all the
105:31 - um the right the traffic that I'm
105:33 - getting so what I should do now uh
105:36 - correct me if I'm wrong is go back here
105:39 - a few times
105:42 - and keep track of what's going
105:45 - on so let me let me make sure I know
105:49 - what this last one is
105:51 - okay so 1958
105:55 - 45 uh so I'm going to go to
105:59 - this this site a few
106:19 - times I have to reopen okay so this one
106:22 - this one doesn't do the live reloading
106:24 - so I have to reopen it okay good all
106:27 - right so the other one that I was trying
106:28 - to use that wouldn't work earlier uh in
106:31 - in this stream it would have live
106:33 - reloaded so I actually do have to stop
106:35 - this one
106:39 - and what's how do I get out of this one
106:41 - what's the uh the proper command
106:44 - here um Q all right Q there's only like
106:48 - four different options to get out of
106:50 - something on the command line so just I
106:52 - just try them
106:57 - all okay so let's just try this
107:02 - again
107:06 - and what was that command G was that it
107:10 - or shift shift
107:11 - G
107:18 - okay hm
107:29 - okay so some stuff was definitely
107:33 - happening uh we're definitely getting
107:36 - [Music]
107:38 - some some
107:41 - traffic now I know it's it's every 10
107:44 - seconds it's going to be sending checks
107:49 - so I'm
107:51 - assuming most of these are probably
107:53 - those 10sec checks right because these
107:55 - are all 10-second
108:19 - intervals oh okay let's see uh it says I
108:23 - can reload by
108:31 - typing how do I do
108:40 - that so I press and I just type
108:43 - e and then enter is
108:49 - that it didn't seem to do anything for
108:51 - me maybe I'm doing it wrong uh I got a
108:54 - suggestion to try to refresh
108:57 - this it doesn't look like it's working
108:59 - yeah
109:03 - um let's um
109:09 - Sho I tell you
109:12 - what I don't want to spend a ton of time
109:17 - uh because I like I don't want to waste
109:19 - your time with this I just had a
109:22 - thought let's just
109:25 - say that this doesn't work and and it in
109:28 - fact engine X itself has to be down for
109:30 - the load balancing to work properly and
109:32 - recognize the servers down that's not
109:33 - necessarily a big deal when I go to
109:36 - update um I just have like a string of
109:40 - update commands anyway like that I copy
109:42 - and paste and I can just add to that to
109:45 - uh stop engine X temporarily so that
109:47 - that stops as well everything gets
109:49 - updated and and it it restarts as the
109:51 - last thing and so if worse comes to
109:54 - worse and it doesn't work like I wanted
109:56 - to I can just stop engine next at the
109:58 - same time uh and you know it doesn't
110:02 - really matter
110:03 - so since I'm having trouble with this uh
110:09 - I'm sure that you all
110:12 - um could probably figure out probably
110:15 - you get
110:17 - theame okay actually I'm going to try
110:20 - one more thing cuz I had something in uh
110:23 - so
110:26 - it's hold on I think I was in
110:32 - there no what did I do shoot I hit WR
110:43 - file e and
110:48 - then okay awesome so that actually work
110:50 - so here's a cool trick um this does not
110:54 - live reload if you use left to access
110:56 - this but uh if you see what I just did I
110:59 - typed in
111:01 - um uh colon and then e uh and then just
111:06 - random uh characters and hit enter says
111:09 - no such file or directory but when it
111:12 - goes back in it actually updates it so I
111:14 - don't have to go back out and come back
111:15 - in it is updated and I think we're
111:17 - getting the same thing here which is
111:19 - basically
111:20 - uh five or I'm sorry 10c
111:24 - intervals uh which makes sense because
111:27 - it's set to check at 10 seconds so these
111:31 - these are not like people checking this
111:34 - obviously
111:35 - uh you know we wouldn't have such nice
111:37 - intervals
111:40 - so I'm going to
111:42 - assume and this isn't we have I don't
111:45 - think this is like a decisive test but I
111:48 - think it's at least somewhat safe to
111:50 - assume that the traffic is not coming
111:52 - from from
111:54 - outside yet uh and that this is all just
111:57 - coming from our load balancer
112:02 - so that's at this point in in the
112:06 - process uh that's okay uh for me um okay
112:13 - um let's see per is
112:17 - it per na is that it sorry can't uh I
112:21 - have the live chat up on my uh one of my
112:23 - old monitors that's the uh resolution is
112:26 - low so the text is kind of weirdly
112:29 - squished together but uh so I having
112:32 - trouble reading that name but somebody
112:33 - in the live chat just said isn't tail F
112:35 - more useful it's definitely is more
112:37 - useful but for some reason it's not
112:39 - working and I I say I've never used it
112:42 - but based on what you all have said it
112:44 - would be more useful definitely so all
112:48 - right so let me get out of here and
112:50 - let's just go on
112:53 - with uh what what we need to do here
112:59 - um I'm I'm skipping down if you're
113:01 - following
113:04 - along I'm skipping down because some of
113:07 - these are just basic engine X commands
113:09 - that we don't even need you know we
113:11 - don't need right now uh it doesn't
113:13 - necessarily have anything to do with
113:15 - load balancing so I'm on step oh step
113:18 - five doesn't matter
113:21 - um basic stuff okay so actually we've
113:24 - completed the entire
113:27 - um guide on no shoot I was on the wrong
113:31 - guide wasn't I sorry sorry sorry that
113:34 - seemed too easy okay
113:38 - um where's I
113:40 - at actually we did yeah so we completed
113:43 - both guys I had two guyses open up at
113:46 - the same time one was a guide that was
113:48 - just on engine X the other was on on
113:49 - load balancing but also using engine X
113:53 - on the servers so I was switching back
113:54 - and forth between the two that's why I
113:56 - was confused for a second but
113:59 - basically
114:01 - um we've gone through uh step three
114:06 - we've we've pretty much kind of tested
114:07 - it right I I'm not like I'm I'm maybe
114:10 - like 90% sure that it's working the way
114:13 - that I wanted to work and I'll have
114:15 - confirmation soon about that um
114:22 - put a test fail
114:30 - over oh man let's let me let me check
114:33 - this out on digital ocean here for a
114:35 - second um let's go in
114:39 - here and see if I had just read farther
114:44 - in the instructions this would have
114:45 - saved so much time our uh our number two
114:49 - droplet that we took down
114:52 - um node on but not engine X is actually
114:56 - reading is down and it's been down for a
114:58 - while
115:01 - so that is confirmation that we needed
115:06 - that in fact as long as we node is down
115:10 - even if engine X is still up it's still
115:13 - going to count it is down that's what we
115:14 - need
115:16 - so
115:17 - excellent that's what we want wanted
115:20 - [Music]
115:23 - now adding more
115:27 - droplets basically the process to add
115:30 - more
115:31 - droplets seems really simple you
115:33 - literally just go to add more droplets
115:35 - and you add a droplet and then it'll
115:37 - work
115:43 - so the
115:48 - um
115:50 - basically what we need to do now which
115:53 - I'll
115:54 - probably I'm probably not going to do it
115:56 - now because this has been such a long
115:59 - stream um if you're just joining for the
116:02 - first time I try to my goal was to keep
116:05 - my streams to half an hour but I usually
116:07 - fail with that and my streams are closer
116:09 - to an hour uh sometimes like somewhere
116:11 - between a half an hour an hour so this
116:13 - stream's definitely been way longer than
116:15 - normal I did get started late because uh
116:18 - I was streaming on a new uh on a
116:20 - different computer than I normally do
116:22 - and so I had some some
116:24 - issues uh or it wasn't the AUD or the uh
116:28 - video wasn't displaying
116:31 - properly uh so I think this is going to
116:34 - probably be a two-parter so
116:38 - tomorrow at 2 pm unless something weird
116:42 - happens I should be able to stream again
116:43 - tomorrow 2m uh I will go over how to
116:47 - configure the SSL to work so I'm not
116:52 - going to work on this anymore we'll pick
116:54 - up right where we left off the only
116:56 - thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
116:57 - read up on how to do configure the SSL
117:00 - so at the bottom of the instructions
117:03 - that we've been going through that I
117:04 - have Linked In the description it
117:06 - actually has links to configuring uh
117:09 - your
117:09 - SSL uh so that there can um you know we
117:13 - can have encryption uh like we need
117:17 - to so I don't know does that sound like
117:20 - a plan uh I had hoped to get through
117:24 - everything I thought that was kind of
117:26 - ambitious since I've never done it
117:27 - before so I really didn't have a way to
117:29 - tell how long it was going to
117:34 - be
117:38 - so all right so it seems like this
117:40 - worked I'm uh right now
117:44 - um I'm going to go through the live chat
117:47 - quickly just to see if anybody had any
117:49 - questions that I
117:50 - missed and after that then uh I'm going
117:53 - to I'm going to end the uh the chat and
117:56 - or the live stream and uh I'll be back
117:58 - uh tomorrow so if you're just here for
118:02 - the actual you know the demo of doing
118:04 - this then and you don't care to stay
118:06 - around for the questions then uh thanks
118:08 - for watching and uh you
118:11 - know what you know join me again uh
118:13 - tomorrow to see the rest of it or some
118:15 - other day uh 2 pm Eastern Time Monday
118:18 - through Friday uh otherwise if you want
118:20 - to stick around or if you have any
118:21 - questions put them in the live chat chat
118:23 - now uh I'll try to get to them if you if
118:26 - you can't stick around but you still
118:27 - want to ask a question you can put it in
118:29 - the comments to this video or you can
118:31 - direct message me on Twitter and I'll
118:34 - try to get uh get you an answer as soon
118:36 - as I
118:39 - can okay so I'm just kind of scrolling
118:43 - through here the live chat and there's a
118:45 - lot so I'm going to be scrolling through
118:47 - quickly so there's a good chance I might
118:48 - miss something something I apologize in
118:51 - advance if I missed your
119:11 - question it looks like there's a lot of
119:13 - good back and forth discussion between
119:15 - you all in the live chat which is
119:16 - awesome I I like
119:18 - that
119:48 - e okay um I'm just going to read this
119:51 - comment because it's nice positive
119:53 - comment
119:56 - um Bren brentor uh I don't know how uh
120:00 - I'm assuming that this three in the
120:02 - middle of this name is meant to be an e
120:04 - so I'm going to say brentor uh it says I
120:06 - find setting up and configuring this
120:08 - stuff super fun awesome I'm glad I'm
120:11 - glad you do uh the last time I did
120:13 - something like this uh I I think I did
120:15 - have some comments that like it was uh
120:19 - a boring or something I don't know if it
120:21 - was as harsh as that but uh some some
120:25 - people I think were expecting more of
120:26 - like uh CSS JavaScript stuff and we were
120:29 - doing a lot of just command line things
120:31 - so I'm glad you enjoyed it I think this
120:34 - stuff's kind of fun I don't know if I'd
120:35 - want to do this day in day out like
120:37 - everything but I enjoy it when I when I
120:39 - do have to do
120:48 - it
121:01 - Sean commented this is a really
121:03 - interesting video glad to be able to see
121:04 - this being done uh for forever need to
121:06 - set up myself yeah I mean I think I made
121:08 - a lot of mistakes during this and uh it
121:11 - took a lot longer than it should have
121:12 - but you know hopefully like if you just
121:15 - see where I messed up at and that helps
121:17 - you to avoid it then that's
121:19 - uh I'm I'm happy that I could at least
121:21 - help in that way so even my my mistakes
121:24 - could hopefully help uh help somebody
121:36 - out okay we have another continuous
121:38 - integration uh solution here that
121:41 - mentioned is Travis so there were I
121:42 - mentioned a few other ones earlier on uh
121:44 - I had asked um IID asked everyone in the
121:48 - live chat to uh
121:49 - you know if they're using continuous
121:51 - integration you know how are they doing
121:52 - it what are they using so I didn't
121:54 - mention Travis before uh Thor Thor
121:57 - mentioned
122:06 - Travis oh some mentions gitlab who else
122:13 - uh get C nice so that's that QX uh I'm
122:19 - I'm going to call you
122:21 - cukes because it's easier than spelling
122:24 - the name out uh so cukes mentions gitlab
122:28 - uh is nice for continuous
122:35 - integration Sebastian said I can hear
122:37 - your macbook's fans I couldn't I
122:40 - actually I always have headphones on
122:42 - playing music so that uh I have a
122:45 - tendency to speak kind of low you know
122:48 - and and maybe Mumble a little bit so I
122:50 - want to make sure you all can hear me so
122:51 - I put headphones on and play music and
122:54 - uh it helps me to talk louder because I
122:57 - can't really hear myself that well uh
123:00 - and also it helps me to not be
123:01 - distracted by other noises which I
123:04 - actually I think somebody is mowing
123:06 - their lawn my neighbor is which is like
123:09 - constant I I can't stand it there's
123:11 - always somebody mowing their lawn next
123:13 - to me so there's never any like quiet so
123:15 - I apologize if you're hearing the
123:17 - background noise uh but
123:19 - I believe it I I'm actually I'm proud of
123:21 - my laptop now I was wondering how it
123:23 - would stand you know the uh the live
123:25 - stream but so far it's been fine earlier
123:28 - today it just totally froze up I had to
123:30 - completely restart it and I wasn't even
123:32 - doing anything you I was I had some
123:34 - browser windows open the code editor and
123:37 - Spotify and I mean that was you know not
123:41 - not that
123:47 - much
123:50 - um Zach asks is dig ocean similar to
123:52 - Heroku Firebase or AWS uh
123:56 - and uh Zach also got lots of answers
123:59 - there uh so uh some answers
124:03 - AWS uh definitely Sim yeah I I would say
124:06 - um it's most similar now I'll I'll say
124:09 - this I haven't I've only played around
124:11 - with Heroku and I haven't ever used
124:14 - Firebase uh but I would say agree it's
124:17 - definitely the most similar to a ws and
124:19 - I think AWS came out with like a direct
124:22 - competitor to digital ocean that's like
124:25 - super simple to use uh I think they came
124:27 - out with that sometime within the
124:30 - last I don't I don't know for sure it
124:32 - was for sure within the last year though
124:35 - I don't remember what it's called
124:37 - Everything has a weird name on AWS I
124:39 - can't keep them
124:44 - straight
124:46 - uh Jose asks
124:49 - when deploying updates to production
124:51 - what's the best tool pushing code to
124:53 - multiple
124:58 - servers and let's see I I know he
125:00 - probably uh got some answers here so um
125:03 - Thor says some kind of continuous
125:05 - integration Patrick um Heroku is
125:08 - nice um oh shoot Thor said my voice was
125:13 - gone hopefully it wasn't it didn't go
125:15 - out for too long uh I haven't I haven't
125:17 - been paying attention to the uh stream
125:19 - health so I I apologize hopefully it
125:23 - didn't cut out
125:25 - um didn't didn't cut out at all
125:27 - hopefully or at least not too too
125:29 - much
125:31 - um yeah I think Jose uh when deploying
125:34 - updates to production for multiple
125:37 - servers I don't know what I'm going to
125:39 - use now that I do have multiple servers
125:42 - that are need to be like mirrored and
125:43 - have the same thing uh so I'm still
125:46 - thinking about what I'm going to use at
125:48 - at this point right now my process for
125:50 - updating this this server uh this
125:53 - droplet on digital ocean is to actually
125:56 - um use SSH to go into the server and
125:59 - then I do a get pull and then I rebuild
126:02 - the app and I start it
126:06 - again so I would love to be able to have
126:09 - a more automated way to do that like
126:13 - let's say every time I push code to
126:17 - GitHub on Master Branch it automatically
126:20 - does all that I think that that is
126:23 - possible I just don't know how to do it
126:25 - so if anybody knows how to do something
126:28 - like that or knows of like a totally
126:30 - different solution that would be even
126:32 - better let me know please um that I I
126:36 - would like to know so I'm I'm still kind
126:38 - of trying to figure that out
126:47 - myself
126:51 - uh Zach asked does anyone have some good
126:52 - recommendations on books about getting
126:54 - better at problem
126:56 - solving
126:58 - um
127:04 - H I'm not sure about problem solving in
127:07 - general I mean because I guess that
127:10 - doesn't even have to be related to
127:11 - coding at all I don't have I don't know
127:14 - of anything off the top of my head for
127:16 - problem solving if you want something
127:18 - that's more coding related I would say
127:20 - like uh a book that has like challenges
127:25 - for you uh maybe like algorithm
127:27 - challenges or things will force you to
127:29 - solve problems so the more you do that
127:32 - the better you'll get now I'm there's
127:35 - probably a resource out there I just
127:37 - don't I don't necessarily know about it
127:39 - but I assume there's a resource out
127:41 - there that will teach you techniques for
127:42 - problem solving like how do you actually
127:45 - approach an algorithm that you've never
127:46 - solved before like a challenge you you
127:48 - know um you know what steps do you take
127:52 - to break that down and to solve it
127:54 - faster I know that that exists I've I've
127:57 - read articles about stuff like that
127:59 - before I don't know a really good book
128:01 - about that to recommend to you but uh
128:04 - hopefully maybe somebody else in the in
128:05 - the live chat has mentioned
128:10 - something okay there's a good
128:11 - conversation here about different
128:13 - languages for beginners and things so um
128:17 - I'm kind of skipping over it though
128:21 - but uh it seems like the basic consensus
128:26 - is you know lower level languages are
128:28 - nice to start out and teach you basic
128:31 - concepts and then you can move on to
128:33 - higher level languages and they feel
128:34 - easy that's kind of my thing like when
128:36 - you look at a language like C um you
128:40 - really like start to appreciate some of
128:41 - the things that are just done for you in
128:43 - like JavaScript like oh I don't have to
128:46 - like say what kind of variable this is
128:49 - you know I can just say it's a variable
128:51 - and it just happens like I don't have to
128:53 - declare that you know it's a string or
128:55 - you know it's
128:58 - um uh all the different I mean see you
129:00 - even have to there are like several
129:02 - different types if you want to use a
129:04 - number that's bigger I think they call
129:05 - it a double I don't remember for sure
129:07 - but um I I agree with that
129:10 - definitely uh you will appreciate more
129:14 - kind of modern
129:15 - languages uh if you do learn some of the
129:17 - older ones
129:30 - uh Sean recommends python for
129:32 - beginners uh yeah I I've done some stuff
129:34 - with python it's really cool uh because
129:36 - there's not like it's a lot with uh
129:38 - indentation and not necessarily like
129:41 - semicolon so uh that's kind of it was
129:44 - kind of fun uh python syntax is like so
129:47 - easy to type I was able to do python uh
129:50 - algorithm challenges on my phone on the
129:53 - regular keyboard and it wasn't annoying
129:55 - because I didn't have to add all these
129:57 - special characters that I would normally
129:58 - have to add like let's say if I were
130:00 - doing JavaScript so I thought that was
130:01 - really
130:06 - cool okay I'm getting towards the end of
130:09 - the live
130:17 - chat
130:33 - okay there's a lot of chat about um how
130:36 - I I couldn't get the uh command to work
130:38 - for for less and uh so I'm kind of
130:41 - skipping through
130:47 - that
130:53 - okay Patrick says you can change the
130:55 - health checks to hit the node server
130:58 - Port so that's cool it looks like I
131:00 - won't have to do that but that's
131:02 - actually good to know that that feature
131:04 - is uh is
131:15 - available um uh BOS soon it's a b o s u
131:19 - n so sorry if I mispronounced that let
131:21 - me know if if I did and how to pronounce
131:24 - it correctly and I I will pronounce it
131:26 - correctly next time but uh bosen says uh
131:29 - nice to be part of this really very
131:31 - insightful discussions on here yeah I I
131:34 - I feel like in this stream it wasn't so
131:38 - much me uh giving anything helpful but
131:41 - the uh live chat was just super helpful
131:43 - so if you are watching later on and you
131:46 - don't really have access to the live
131:47 - chat um sorry about that I'm trying to
131:50 - read off as much as I can from the live
131:52 - chat so you can you know get something
131:54 - out of that uh but yeah it's just you
131:57 - you all have been amazing uh in the live
132:00 - chat I'm definitely going to you know
132:01 - save this chat and and reference it uh
132:04 - in the
132:08 - future uh
132:10 - Rohan ask uh no questions but what's

132:31 - streams you know that I frequently do
132:33 - that I I I don't read down farther and I
132:36 - answer a question that's already been
132:37 - answered so I also link to my Twitter in
132:40 - the description for the video so it's
132:42 - it's there if you don't want to have to
132:43 - typee it in you can link right right
132:45 - there to my Twitter account I have my
132:47 - own YouTube channel as well and there's
132:48 - a link to that and I have my other
132:50 - Social Media stuff linked from there so
132:52 - if you care to follow me on any other
132:55 - social media you can I I'm on like most
132:58 - of the main social media things but I'm
133:00 - primarily active on you know YouTube and
133:03 - uh Twitter and I do some Instagram stuff
133:06 - too but not really a lot of code I just
133:09 - like take pictures of the food that I
133:11 - cook and put it up there occasionally I
133:13 - do some code stuff but uh that's pretty
133:15 - much it you you're free to you know
133:17 - follow me on link into if you want uh
133:19 - for connections but I don't uh other
133:22 - than for networking I don't I'm not

133:26 - and I'm not
133:29 - on yeah I'm I'm like on most of the
133:31 - other networks but I don't really do

133:40 - them all right cool Thor it looks like
133:43 - Thor followed me so everybody who's
133:45 - following me on either my my YouTube
133:47 - channel or Twitter or anything else uh
133:50 - thank you uh thanks for following um I
133:53 - don't I don't get any money off of
133:55 - subscribers or followers or anything
133:57 - like that but I I just really appreciate
133:59 - uh that you know you you care enough to
134:02 - to want to know what's uh you know when
134:04 - I'm streaming and what's going on and
134:05 - that and you you've been helping me out
134:07 - so I really appreciate
134:16 - that
134:20 - Umberto says I'm in an HR office that is
134:24 - more like a sports club with the
134:25 - atmosphere my co-workers prefer prefer I
134:28 - miss my
134:29 - cave yeah I I understand that uh when
134:33 - I'm uh I am I'm at home today so it's a
134:36 - different atmosphere than I'm used to
134:38 - and uh actually my my wife took the kids
134:40 - to their grandparents house and she took
134:43 - um one of my daughters out to lunch with
134:45 - her and the other ones with her
134:46 - grandparents so normally my house would
134:47 - be super noisy uh cuz I have four kids
134:50 - and they're all under eight years old
134:52 - but uh right now it's actually pretty
134:53 - quiet other than the
134:55 - lawnmowers and uh but when I am at work
134:58 - I just like lock myself in my office and
135:00 - my co-workers call it the cave uh I keep
135:03 - the lights out and I stay I stay locked
135:06 - in with headphones on so I'm not
135:09 - antisocial I just uh get a lot more done
135:11 - without interruptions
135:16 - so okay so uh the uh the person that I
135:21 - said
135:24 - um say my name is Q
135:29 - qox okay so I I I don't even remember
135:32 - how I pronounced it but
135:34 - uh the name is qox so I will do my best
135:38 - to try to remember that and pronounce it
135:40 - correctly qox that definitely makes more
135:43 - sense than what I was trying to uh to
135:45 - say so thanks for letting me know how to
135:47 - pronounce that
135:48 - uh if I ever mispronounce anybody's name
135:50 - on here let me know I I don't want to um
135:54 - I don't want to be mispronouncing your
135:56 - name uh Patrick said Dinner Bell just
135:58 - rang thanks for the stream Jesse I'll be
136:00 - back tomorrow all right yeah awesome uh
136:02 - thanks for watching uh Patrick and uh
136:05 - for hanging in here for you know what
136:07 - was ended up being a really long
136:10 - stream uh Hugo says you can use get
136:14 - hooks uh so I think that's probably in
136:18 - response to me talking about uh ways to
136:22 - um push code to um uh to multiple drop
136:26 - lists multiple servers so I have I've
136:29 - read a little bit about get hooks but I
136:31 - haven't I haven't been too successful
136:33 - with them so maybe I'm GNA have to read
136:35 - some more uh some more about
136:43 - that uh Sean ask any good lists of
136:46 - programming problems to try in any
136:48 - language H actually I I can't remember
136:52 - offand what I've seen but I definitely
136:54 - have seen some websites uh that have
136:57 - programming problems like there's a site
137:00 - called hacker rank that does a lot of
137:02 - like programming competitions uh I
137:04 - subscribe to a newsletter that gives me
137:06 - a new programming algorithm like I don't
137:09 - know if it's once a week or once a day
137:11 - or something but um maybe I'll um maybe
137:15 - I'll do a video about that that sounds
137:17 - like a good topic so uh I'm going to
137:19 - make a note about that uh actually right
137:24 - now uh I keep a um I keep a list of
137:29 - topics that you all have either
137:31 - requested or uh I kind of noticed that a
137:34 - lot of people ask about uh in the live
137:37 - chat to do videos on so I I hope to be
137:40 - doing some videos and putting them on my
137:43 - YouTube channel very
137:46 - soon
137:48 - so I will add that to the list because
137:50 - that sounds like a really useful a
137:52 - useful thing to maybe highlight some
137:55 - some places with good
137:57 - um resources good challenges uh to code
138:02 - in in different languages uh not just
138:04 - specifically for you know JavaScript or
138:06 - something like
138:16 - that
138:25 - okay all right let me get through almost
138:27 - to the very end here uh of the live
138:33 - chat
138:35 - qox says you can use a script that SSH
138:39 - into all servers and pulls and restarts
138:41 - not best practice but a good start okay
138:45 - that's yeah I never thought about that
138:48 - but you're right yeah that that might be
138:51 - um a good like kind of thing to use
138:54 - before I can really figure out what I
138:57 - you know how I how I want to do like a
138:58 - more permanent you know solution so um
139:03 - okay Thor says anible can do that okay
139:05 - yeah I noticed Patrick G mention anible
139:07 - I forgot to say that so I I haven't done
139:10 - anything with anible other than I I know
139:12 - that I've heard the name before but I
139:14 - haven't uh done anything with that so
139:16 - I'll have to check that out
139:20 - um let's
139:22 - see in response to Sean's question about
139:25 - list of programming problems uh Thor
139:28 - recommends exorcism do exor yeah is that
139:35 - exorcism. yeah for some reason it looked
139:37 - weird to me like it was spelled
139:39 - differently but I think it's
139:41 - exorcism. so that's a funny name but um
139:45 - or uh Advent of
139:48 - code Thor says advant of code is for
139:51 - more advanced things but it has a nice
139:53 - story around
140:05 - it okay Thor says uh anible is actually
140:09 - uh really easy to set up uh and fast so
140:11 - maybe I will have to give that uh give
140:14 - that a
140:16 - look
140:19 - oh yeah qo says uh can do it via VIA
140:23 - stream uh and uh and you all can help me
140:26 - I I didn't think about that but that's
140:28 - that actually that would make for a good
140:29 - stream and I would appreciate the help
140:31 - so maybe I'll I'll have to I'll have to
140:33 - remember that uh when when I do try to
140:36 - set up something there to uh to update
140:38 - for some type of continuous integration
140:40 - thing I'll stream
140:44 - it Chad says hey everyone uh Chad's
140:47 - coming in at the end there uh nice to
140:50 - have you here sorry that you missed most
140:52 - of it the recording is going to be
140:53 - available just a few minutes after I end
140:55 - the stream so you can uh check that out
140:57 - it's it's pretty long you could probably
140:59 - skip through a lot of the beginning I'm
141:01 - going to have to I don't know maybe I
141:04 - can cut out the beginning or at least
141:05 - put like a Tim stamp somewhere in the
141:07 - description so people can skip that uh
141:09 - because I I was having a lot of issues
141:13 - uh with my streaming at the
141:16 - beginning
141:25 - oh cool Thor Thor just follow follows me
141:28 - everywhere so
141:29 - awesome Rohan followed as
141:32 - well um okay Rohan says hacker rank is
141:36 - good and
141:37 - project uler i e l r i don't know
141:41 - exactly how to say that um are great
141:45 - actually I did hear project uler I
141:47 - I've heard of that before I'll have to
141:50 - check it out again because I can't
141:51 - remember what exactly it was like but I
141:54 - now that I see it I remember
141:56 - that um there's also a
141:59 - subreddit but Rohan says there's also
142:02 - subreddit don't know how active it is
142:04 - okay and last comment um oh now it's not
142:08 - the last one I had one more one more
142:10 - sneak in there um but I can't we still
142:13 - have 27 viewers even after uh after this
142:16 - kind of epic length stream here uh so
142:19 - we've been going for almost two and a
142:20 - half hours uh so for all of you uh 27
142:24 - viewers thanks for sticking around for
142:26 - this long uh so Hugo says for computer
142:29 - programming challenges project uh uler
142:32 - is good um and then URI online judge
142:36 - I've never heard of that one so can
142:38 - check that oh it's pronounced Oiler I
142:43 - guess I guess it's German oh okay
142:47 - oil okay
142:53 - cool yeah I'm not my German
142:55 - pronunciation is not super great I
142:56 - didn't realize that was a German word my
142:58 - last name is German so I know how to
143:00 - pronounce that but um other than that
143:03 - I'm not uh I did attempt to learn German
143:06 - at one time but um I always try to learn
143:09 - a lang like a a speaking language like
143:12 - you know French or you know Italian or
143:14 - German or something and I never get past
143:16 - like the Basics
143:19 - so
143:22 - um oh awesome uh Thor is from from
143:26 - Germany so cool yeah my my ancestors at
143:29 - some point were from Germany um but they
143:33 - uh they moved to the United States um
143:36 - before it was the actually called the
143:38 - United States so they they've been over
143:40 - here for for a long time uh
143:44 - so uh that's cool though uh um I like
143:47 - that people from all over the world uh
143:49 - watch this I think that's that's really
143:52 - awesome um all right so that's it that's
143:55 - the end of the uh the live chat uh so
143:59 - hopefully I covered every all the
144:00 - questions
144:03 - um and uh I'll be back tomorrow I'll
144:07 - probably be streaming from home again so
144:10 - hopefully I won't have the same
144:11 - technical issues and maybe I can do some
144:13 - testing earlier on and and get that all
144:15 - worked out um
144:18 - but uh I really appreciate all the help
144:20 - you gave me this has been uh amazing um
144:23 - I it would have taken me so much longer
144:26 - to get through all this without you so
144:29 - it already took longer than I thought it
144:30 - would uh but it it really would have I I
144:34 - probably would have been lost at some
144:35 - point so uh thank you so much and uh I
144:39 - hope you all got something out of this
144:41 - as
144:43 - well uh and Thor says thanks for the
144:45 - stream you're welcome

144:53 - pm eastern time uh I'll be streaming
144:55 - again and we'll be setting up the uh the
144:57 - SSL to work and actually making this
144:59 - load balancer go live uh on on the real
145:03 - live site so
145:07 - um uh let me I can't find the window to
145:10 - stop the stream I have too many windows
145:12 - open uh
145:15 - so have a great day and uh it looks
145:19 - there are people still going on the on
