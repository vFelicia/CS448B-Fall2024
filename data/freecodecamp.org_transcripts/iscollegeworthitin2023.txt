00:00 - Aside from buying a house, going to university is probably the biggest investment decision
00:05 - you'll face in your entire life,
00:07 - At the end of the day, going to college should be an economic decision, not an emotional
00:12 - decision,
00:13 - In this free course, Free Co Camp founder Quincy Larson will help you decide how to
00:17 - plan for college,
00:19 - He'll explain how US higher education works, how the labor market works, and he'll provide
00:24 - some strategies for minimizing your costs,
00:27 - At the end of the day, he wants to help you maximize your return on investment,
00:32 - Quincy recently published a free, full-length book about developer careers, and college
00:37 - is the number one thing people ask him about,
00:40 - By the way, people also ask him a lot about chat GPT and whether they still need to learn
00:43 - to code,
00:44 - Spoiler alert, his answer is yes,
00:47 - So grab your notebook or crack open your text editor because Quincy's going to fire a lot
00:53 - of data at you from his decades of working in adult education,
00:57 - Quincy pulls no punches and has no mercy when talking about the US university system, the
01:01 - student debt epidemic, and a student visa system that leaves so many bright people unable
01:06 - to get a US degree,
01:08 - But rest assured, he has tons of practical tips that your college counselor probably
01:12 - never told you about,
01:14 - At the end of the day, Quincy wants the same thing for you that your family wants, for
01:18 - you to earn a good living and have a ton of career options,
01:22 - If you learn something from this course, be sure to send it to a friend or family member
01:25 - who's planning for college,
01:27 - Hey, I'm Quincy Larson, teacher and founder of FreeCodeCamp,org,
01:34 - And today we're going to be asking the very timely question,
01:39 - Is college still worth it?
01:41 - And I'm going to be arguing that in most cases, yes, it is still worth it,
01:44 - You're going to hear all this hype around, oh, college, who needs college anymore?
01:48 - I'm going to argue from numbers that college is still incredibly useful,
01:55 - It's still incredibly worth it,
01:57 - I'm also going to be talking about lots of situations where I don't think it's worth
02:00 - it,
02:01 - And I'm going to be talking about some strategies that you can use to reduce student debt, reduce
02:06 - the capital outlay that this giant four-year education can represent for many people who
02:15 - are learning,
02:16 - So let's dive in,
02:17 - What about return on investment?
02:21 - The first thing you should consider about education is this is an economic decision,
02:26 - You may have aspirational reasons why you want to go to college,
02:29 - Maybe you're the first person in your family lineage to ever go and get a degree,
02:34 - And that can be a very proud moment,
02:37 - Maybe you have served in the armed forces and you essentially have this freeway to go
02:44 - to university in the sense that you've got the GI Bill that's going to pay for a lot
02:47 - of your higher education,
02:49 - You still should think about things in terms of economics,
02:53 - And you should still think about it in terms of how much money is going to cost and ultimately
02:57 - how much is going to affect your earning potential,
03:01 - We're going to think about this in terms of return on investment, ROI,
03:07 - You may have heard that acronym before,
03:09 - There are other ways, of course, you can think about this,
03:11 - For example, if you're a big finance person, you might think in terms of net present value,
03:16 - which will factor in the time value of money,
03:20 - And that's a very real consideration as well because money today is worth a lot more than
03:25 - money in the future,
03:27 - Not just because of inflation, but because of opportunity to invest that money,
03:31 - So you might, instead of going to university and spending the equivalent of $40,000 on
03:37 - four years of in-state tuition, you might want to just take that $40,000 if you have
03:42 - it in cash now and just put it in some sort of investment vehicle, probably like an index
03:47 - fund and just let it accumulate over time,
03:50 - That might be a rational thing to do, depending on the ROI that you're looking at,
03:54 - Now, in order to figure out what the ROI is, we want to figure out how much money you're
04:00 - earning right now, just with your current skills,
04:04 - You can probably go out and get a job as a janitor and make about $12 an hour in the
04:10 - United States,
04:11 - So if you think about $12 an hour, you multiply that times about 2,000 hours per year,
04:18 - The year you're going to be working, that's about 40 hours a week times approximately
04:23 - 50 weeks, assuming you've got two weeks off, which may or may not be paid,
04:27 - I'm just going to call it $24,000 a year,
04:31 - So let's go ahead and let's think in terms, I'm going to show a fancy chart on the screen
04:37 - right now,
04:38 - This is approximately how much you can expect to earn with varying levels of what we'll
04:42 - call educational attainment,
04:45 - So if you went to high school, great, congratulations on graduating from high school,
04:51 - You're going to make more than somebody who didn't go to high school or didn't finish
04:54 - high school,
04:55 - Now, getting a general equivalency diploma, GED, that's basically the same as going to
05:01 - high school for most economic considerations,
05:05 - If you go to some college, that does technically increase your earning potential a little bit,
05:09 - But what really helps is not going to some college, not getting an associate's necessarily,
05:14 - but getting the full bachelor's degree,
05:16 - A bachelor's degree will roughly 2x your expected annual earnings over what you would get if
05:24 - you just had a high school diploma,
05:27 - So that is why you definitely want to consider going to college depending on how many years
05:32 - of productive life you have left,
05:34 - So let's say you're 18 to 25 would be a traditional student,
05:40 - So that's the age range that most people are,
05:44 - That's what most economists and most educators would consider to be traditional university
05:49 - student,
05:50 - That probably means that if you live to be about 80 years old, which is the life expectancy
05:58 - of most Americans, like women live slightly longer than men, there can be all kinds of
06:03 - different factors like your income bracket, family history, things like that that can
06:09 - play into it,
06:10 - But we'll just call the average life expectancy of an American 80 years old,
06:14 - So you probably have already picked up on what I'm talking about so far that I'm focusing
06:19 - mostly on the United States,
06:21 - That's because I grew up in the United States,
06:24 - I'm an American citizen,
06:25 - I have studied abroad,
06:26 - I studied in China for several years,
06:28 - So I have kind of a little bit of study abroad perspective, and I have worked extensively
06:33 - with international students who come from other countries to study in the United States,
06:37 - So we'll talk about that later too,
06:39 - But there is going to be a heavy US focus in this course,
06:43 - So if you're going to live to be 80 years old and you're going to work maybe 40 years,
06:49 - after you finish, so you could basically take that 2x multiplier and you could take the
06:54 - difference between earning $24,000 a year as a janitor and earning something like $44,000
07:02 - as a college graduate,
07:03 - And by the way, your janitor income is not going to necessarily increase steadily over
07:07 - time,
07:08 - It may keep up with inflation, but don't expect to be making like 2x as a janitor just because
07:13 - you have a whole lot of janitorial experience,
07:15 - However, if you're working as a software engineer, you might be able to make 4x, 10x, what you
07:21 - made when you first got out of college as you gradually progress through your career
07:26 - and accrue more experience, accrue more tacit knowledge of how the industry works, accrue
07:33 - more responsibility,
07:35 - So that is what I'll say is you want to be thinking in those terms how long you're going
07:40 - to be working and what the wage differential is going to be, and that will be the best
07:44 - way to figure out your ROI,
07:46 - How does student debt work?
07:50 - In the United States, the way that most people pay for their education is through some combination
07:57 - of working during university, some combination of their parents, helping them pay for school,
08:04 - scholarships, and of course student debt,
08:07 - And student debt is one of the most complicated factors in trying to determine ROI because
08:13 - you have to repay that student debt and you're not sure whether you're going to finish university,
08:18 - You're not sure whether your wage after you finish university is going to be high enough
08:22 - for you to be able to repay that debt,
08:25 - And I know lots of people who have, I'm not exaggerating, more than $100,000 US dollars
08:30 - worth of student debt that they have to repay,
08:33 - So with student debt, the best way to think of it is it's additional risk that you're
08:38 - incurring, risk,
08:42 - So I said earlier that if you finish college, you're going to basically double your income
08:49 - in aggregate,
08:50 - Now again, it does depend on what you're going to study and we'll get to that in a minute,
08:56 - But the big thing that you need to keep in mind is student debt is going to be there
09:02 - whether you finish or not,
09:04 - You're taking a risk when you take out a student loan,
09:09 - If you study a field and you can't get a job afterward, that's pretty bad,
09:13 - Maybe you have to be what's called underemployed and you're working in hospitality despite
09:17 - the fact that you studied nursing or something like that,
09:21 - Now in practice, I think if you study nursing, you'll almost certainly be able to find a
09:23 - job as a nurse,
09:26 - But let's say hypothetically, you study physics and you can't find a job as a physicist or
09:33 - in order to get a job as a physicist, you have to go back to school and get a PhD,
09:37 - So the working physicists I know have PhDs,
09:40 - We won't get into graduate school in this course because I really want to focus on the
09:45 - decision to get the initial four-year degree, but I will say that a lot of times you get
09:50 - into a field and there's what's called credential inflation,
09:59 - And what credential inflation means is basically you want to work as a librarian, oh, it's
10:04 - no longer good enough to have an undergraduate degree in library science,
10:08 - You need to get a master's degree in library science and that may sound absurd,
10:12 - Why do you need a master's degree to be a librarian?
10:15 - But unfortunately, that's where things are going in a lot of fields that are more competitive,
10:19 - So the risk, the biggest risk is not getting a job when you get out because you have this
10:26 - university degree and any sort of degree will give you an edge in the labor market,
10:31 - It will increase your likelihood of getting interviews and ultimately getting hired for
10:36 - a variety of different jobs, even those jobs that are not related to your major,
10:39 - The biggest risk is that for some reason you can't finish,
10:42 - Life gets in the way,
10:45 - Your parents have some sort of accident and you need to go be their caretaker or you get
10:50 - pregnant or you have some sort of illness like you have experienced vertigo or any number
10:57 - of different things that can cause you to have trouble being able to focus and being
11:01 - able to finish school,
11:03 - So if you do not finish school, the debt remains and you still have to figure out a way to
11:09 - pay that off and the worst situation you can find yourself in is where you've taken a lot
11:13 - of student debt out and you no longer have the ability to repay it because you're earning
11:18 - way below and you might be able to go into something called forbearance where essentially
11:24 - your debt is deferred to an extent or you are paying a very small amount as opposed
11:28 - to the full amount that you're supposed to pay but when you're doing that your debt is
11:32 - not getting paid off and in fact it may actually be getting larger and at some point you're
11:37 - going to have to figure out a way to pay off that debt,
11:40 - So here is my humble advice to you,
11:44 - To the extent you can completely avoid the risk of debt, completely avoid it,
11:51 - If you have already taken out student debt, my humble advice would be, you know, do whatever
11:55 - you can to pay it off as soon as possible because debt can be an albatross around your
11:59 - neck,
12:00 - It can really weigh you down and prevent you from taking the kinds of career risks that
12:04 - might ultimately bear a whole lot of fruit when you're a little later in your career,
12:09 - You may have to be focusing all your time and energy working a certain job that you
12:13 - don't particularly like but that pays the bills and you don't have energy left at the
12:18 - end of the day to do things like learn the code or to learn mathematics or to build your
12:22 - network or to build cool projects and put them on GitHub that you can essentially use
12:27 - as portfolio pieces to help you get a better job later on,
12:31 - So the biggest risk, debt, if you can avoid debt, avoid debt and I'm going to give you
12:37 - some strategies for how to avoid getting student debt later,
12:43 - What major should I study?
12:45 - So there are a lot of people out there who will joke about getting a liberal arts degree
12:49 - like, oh, of course you're poor, you got a liberal arts degree, of course you're poor,
12:53 - you studied drama or you studied music or something like that,
12:55 - I think that that attitude is really not productive and I know plenty of people who studied liberal
13:01 - arts that are working in positions of power in society,
13:05 - I studied liberal arts,
13:07 - My undergraduate degree is in liberal arts and I'm running an NGO and have like 35 people
13:12 - reporting to me, right?
13:13 - So you could argue that those skills are not immediately useful for getting certain types
13:18 - of jobs, but later in life they become incredibly useful,
13:20 - If you look at what liberal arts people learn, they learn foreign languages, they learn argumentation
13:26 - and debate rhetoric, they learn how to analyze things and how to write really well and how
13:33 - to present themselves at a whiteboard like this,
13:37 - So there are a variety of different skills you'll build if you study liberal arts, but
13:43 - let's face it, if you study a field like computer science, you are going to be vastly better
13:48 - off,
13:49 - And I'm going to put a chart up here that will show approximately how much more money
13:53 - you can make as somebody from a purely economic standpoint, how much more money you can make
13:57 - as a computer science major than pretty much any other major,
14:00 - Now one thing you're going to note here is, ooh, petroleum engineering, maybe I should
14:04 - study petroleum engineering just for fun here,
14:06 - Let's put this petroleum engineering job description into indeed,com, which is a job search engine
14:12 - I frequently use to show people approximately how much market demand, how many roles there
14:17 - are,
14:18 - Now this is a very coarse measure, but it's better than nothing and we can see that there
14:22 - are very few jobs for petroleum engineering,
14:27 - Those jobs may be higher paid, but there are fewer of them and I don't know why petroleum
14:32 - engineers are paid marginally more than computer science majors, but I don't really care that
14:37 - much because the amount difference is so small,
14:41 - Thinking about your life, the difference between making $80,000 and $100,000 is a lot less
14:47 - of a difference than going from making $25,000 a year to $50,000 or $45,000, a similar to
14:55 - $20,000 jump,
14:57 - The reality is, once you have a certain amount of money, every marginal dollar beyond that
15:01 - still feels good, but it's less vital to your survival,
15:05 - So I would say that, yes, you'll find reports of people who say, oh, computer science isn't
15:11 - the highest paid major,
15:13 - The reality is there are vastly more jobs for computer science majors than there are
15:18 - for virtually every other major you can do, and it's a very well-defined skill set, whereas
15:23 - studying business administration, less well-defined,
15:27 - If you look at the Fortune 50 CEOs in the United States as I'm filming, you're going
15:33 - to see that they have a wide variety of different majors,
15:38 - Many of them studied liberal arts like I did, and then the most well-represented, of course,
15:43 - being engineers,
15:45 - If you think about it, that makes sense because one of the biggest companies in the United
15:50 - States, they're mostly tech companies,
15:52 - Every company is trying to become a tech company, so it definitely helps to have somebody with
15:58 - an engineering knowledge at the helm of that company,
16:02 - I would strongly recommend studying computer science,
16:04 - I would recommend it above other STEM fields, and here's why,
16:08 - I have lots of friends who studied physics,
16:09 - I have lots of friends who studied chemistry,
16:11 - I have lots of friends who studied life science, and most of them have seen the writing on
16:18 - the wall that the actual high-paying jobs are working with software, and they've had
16:23 - to go and learn to code after school,
16:26 - Maybe they did some coding,
16:27 - If you study any STEM field, science, technology, engineering, mathematics, you are probably
16:33 - going to take some programming classes, but when you graduate and you look at the job
16:37 - market, you're going to say, wow, I really need to learn more programming,
16:42 - You're going to end up on freecodecamp,org,
16:44 - Welcome,
16:45 - We love having people who have science backgrounds further refine their programming skills, and
16:50 - we're happy to help with that,
16:53 - You may be able to take more programming, more mathematics, more things that are relevant
16:57 - to the actual developer jobs that are out there, that are generally the best jobs in
17:02 - the country, in my opinion, that are going to give you a good combination of flexibility,
17:06 - being able to work remotely, career trajectory,
17:09 - You can go all the way up to CEO as a software engineer, whereas if you study certain fields,
17:16 - there may be some sort of area where you cap out and you have to go get an MBA or something
17:20 - to continue to proceed, and of course, compensation,
17:26 - Software engineers make more money than basically anybody, including people who essentially
17:30 - go to school to learn how to make money, people who study finance, business administration,
17:34 - things like that,
17:35 - That tells you a lot about the value of computer science,
17:38 - Another quick note, there are degrees in fields like computer engineering, IT, and another
17:46 - one is software engineering,
17:47 - Now, you would actually think software engineering would be the best major in terms of being
17:51 - prepared to work in software engineering,
17:54 - I can't tell you exactly why, because I'm not sure exactly why, but most hiring managers,
18:01 - most HR people are proactively looking for people who have computer science degrees and
18:06 - having a degree in software engineering, while it might actually help you do the job better,
18:10 - it may make it slightly harder for you to find that job,
18:14 - When in doubt, just go with a computer science degree,
18:17 - What if I'm older?
18:20 - If you are older, again, it comes back into the question of ROI,
18:31 - How many years do you think you're going to be working?
18:33 - I would say that don't underestimate yourself,
18:37 - I'm 42,
18:38 - I feel high energy,
18:39 - Granted, I don't have any genetic issues,
18:42 - I'm not on insulin,
18:43 - I don't have a lot of things that may be plaguing people as they get into their 40s, but I do
18:49 - believe that I can probably work another 20 or 30 years productively,
18:54 - Retirement age in the United States, I believe, is 67,
18:57 - Just subtract your age from 67, and that's a rough rubric for how many years you're going
19:03 - to have left,
19:05 - Now, if you take that multiplier, double your income, and then you subtract out the cost
19:11 - of a college education, again, if you go to in-state tuition at a four-year institution,
19:17 - it's going to be about $10,000 a year in tuition,
19:19 - That doesn't include fees,
19:23 - When you go to a big state university, you're kind of also paying for them to maintain the
19:27 - lawn on the stadium and to maintain the random buildings that provide air conditioning and
19:33 - water to all the other, the physical plant,
19:37 - There are lots of fees, student activity fees, library fees, things like that, so factor
19:40 - those in,
19:41 - Then, of course, the big thing is cost of living, and the thing you need to factor in
19:45 - is, okay, I'm going to be spending approximately 28 hours per week,
19:50 - If I'm a full-time student, that's about how much time a full-time student spends studying
19:53 - in the United States, according to studies that I've read,
19:56 - You might think, oh, I thought students would probably be, it'd be more like 40 hours,
19:59 - Now, it turns out that school is not nearly as hard as everybody pretends it is, and 28
20:04 - hours is about how much people spend studying and going to class, taking exams, all those
20:09 - different things,
20:10 - Now, that may vary from major to major,
20:13 - Like if you're studying medicine, for example, it may be way more intense than that, but
20:18 - if you're working, let's say, 28 hours a week on your studies, that's 28 hours of time and
20:23 - energy that you don't have to devote to a job that can help you earn income,
20:29 - Let's say that you're working at a grocery store as a manager, and you're working there,
20:35 - you're making $30,000 a year, and that job takes 40 hours out of your week,
20:44 - You could basically have to bolt on an extra 28 hours per week worth of work if you're
20:49 - full-time or if you're doing part-time school, might only be like half that, 14 hours additional
20:54 - study,
20:55 - It would take you twice as many years to finish the program, but it may be much more sustainable,
21:02 - To answer the question of should you go back to school if you're older, it ultimately comes
21:05 - down to ROI, and it comes down to your own personal feelings about how much longer you
21:10 - think you're going to be able to work and whether you think you could balance going
21:13 - to school with your current obligations, both familial and work,
21:22 - What if I'm outside the US?
21:25 - So of course, I'm very blessed to have been born in the United States,
21:30 - I'm a native English speaker, I've got a US passport, and there are only about 4% of
21:36 - the world population also shares that privilege,
21:41 - If you were born in China, India, Nigeria, one of many other countries that receive many
21:47 - of the 1 million international students that are studying in the United States, these are
21:51 - people that have generally finished high school in their country and then gotten into a university
22:00 - here in the US, they cleared the very lengthy visa process, maybe their family has saved
22:05 - up for a generation to be able to afford for them to be able to go to the United States
22:09 - and study,
22:11 - If you're one of those people, it can be very tricky,
22:14 - I'm not going to give super granular advice for that, but I will say that there may be
22:19 - some alternatives that don't involve going through the visa process where you can still
22:23 - graduate from a US university without having to spend a huge amount of money,
22:29 - Now, we're talking about $40,000 US per year to attend a state school without state tuition,
22:37 - So, by virtue of being outside of the country, you are out of state, and in fact, some schools
22:41 - may charge even higher tuition for international students than they would charge for another
22:46 - US resident who is just from a different state,
22:51 - Let's say I grew up in Oklahoma, if I had studied in Texas, even though it's very close
22:55 - geographically, I would have to pay out of state tuition, which is three times as much,
22:59 - which really incentivizes you to go to school in your state,
23:03 - As an international student, you face a whole lot of additional considerations around cost,
23:07 - Later, I'm going to talk about some alternatives that can allow you to get an American education
23:13 - without spending American international student prices,
23:18 - Does it matter which type of university I go to?
23:21 - So, it does matter quite a bit which type of university you go to, and I'll tell you
23:25 - which one you should go to in a minute, but let me first lay out the three big categories,
23:30 - So, first, there's public, and that could be both community college and universities,
23:39 - That could be like a state university system,
23:41 - It could be just like the research university systems, for example, in California, you have
23:45 - California State University, and you also have University of California system,
23:49 - Then there's private, and that's nonprofit,
23:56 - Private nonprofit,
23:57 - This is usually private schools, small liberal arts colleges,
24:01 - It can also be like all the Ivy League schools or private,
24:05 - Most private universities in the United States are owned by churches, for example, so they
24:11 - may have some required theology-related credits for the undergrad,
24:16 - Then there's what's called private for-profit,
24:21 - This would be the kinds of universities you see on late-night TV, basically, running commercials,
24:30 - There have been so many of these that have been shut down recently because, frankly,
24:34 - you should just assume that these are scams until proven otherwise, in my opinion,
24:39 - I know there are probably lots of people out there who are watching this who work at a
24:42 - private for-profit, and if you're one of the good ones, fantastic,
24:47 - I really believe that these are the only considerations you should make, and it may be harder to get
24:54 - into these institutions,
24:55 - There may be more paperwork,
24:57 - There may be less guidance from a counselor-slash-salesperson to try to get you in, but it is absolutely
25:02 - best to go to one of these,
25:06 - Now, you generally want to go to a community college first,
25:11 - The reason is twofold,
25:13 - One, community colleges are a lot cheaper,
25:16 - They are a lot cheaper,
25:18 - They're designed for people who don't necessarily have a whole lot like a giant scholarship
25:26 - for playing sports or for academic reasons,
25:28 - They're also designed with people who don't want to commute really far,
25:33 - They want to continue living with their parents or living with a roommate in the area where
25:36 - they have their job or if they already have kids not having to uproot or spend a huge
25:41 - amount of time on the road, basically,
25:44 - A lot of times, the instruction you get at a community college is actually better than
25:49 - what you'll get at a four-year research institution,
25:52 - The reason is everybody at community colleges is focused on teaching,
25:56 - They're focused on actually helping the students learn, and they're less focused on trying
26:00 - to get their H number and get more citations in academia,
26:05 - The other thing that I'll say about community colleges, in addition to being cheaper and
26:10 - having potentially better pedagogy, is that you can use your completion of a community
26:17 - college to transfer into a school that otherwise might be very selective and difficult to get
26:21 - into,
26:22 - For example, I talk to people all the time who go to a community college and then are
26:25 - able to transition,
26:27 - For example, University of Texas, pretty difficult to get into University of Texas,
26:35 - They probably turn away a lot of people, but if you go to a community college in Texas,
26:39 - it's almost like you're guaranteed to be able to transition in,
26:41 - Now, this depends from community college to community college,
26:44 - I would definitely research this beforehand, but if you plan to go to a more selective
26:50 - state university, and when I say state, I mean the same as public, a state university,
26:55 - then community college can make a lot of sense,
26:59 - You finish two years at community college, you transfer into a four-year university,
27:05 - and you earn your bachelor's degree,
27:06 - You already kind of have an associate's degree, which you can get through community colleges,
27:10 - and some community colleges may even offer bachelor's degrees,
27:14 - If you want to stay at a community college the entire time and get a bachelor's degree
27:17 - there, I don't think there's any harm,
27:18 - It should be good return on investment,
27:21 - Now, the second one is private, private nonprofit,
27:27 - These are all your Ivy Leagues, MIT, Caltech, a whole lot of the best universities in America
27:34 - are private,
27:35 - And that kind of makes sense in the sense that they usually have really high tuition,
27:41 - so they're able to pay their professors a lot more, maybe they have a lot more money
27:46 - to plow into having fancier campuses, things like that,
27:51 - They probably have a lot more money for activities and things like that,
27:55 - These institutions are often much older,
27:57 - As I said, they're often owned by churches,
28:01 - If you want to know what the most prestigious universities in the United States are, just
28:06 - stack rank them by their age,
28:08 - Harvard is the oldest university in the United States, and it also happens to be generally
28:12 - regarded as the best,
28:14 - Yale, Princeton, Columbia, the other Ivy League schools, also very old schools,
28:19 - In fact, you'd have to go pretty far down the list before you got to a prestigious institution
28:23 - that was founded within the last 100 years,
28:28 - You can absolutely go to these private nonprofit universities, but they are expensive,
28:33 - They're dramatically more expensive than paying in-state tuition,
28:37 - You might be spending something like $40,000,
28:38 - You might be spending something like $60,000 a year just in tuition and fees to be able
28:42 - to attend these universities,
28:44 - So the ROI, you would think, oh, well, these private nonprofits probably have lower ROI
28:50 - than just attending a good public university,
28:52 - And that is true in a lot of cases, depending on what you major in,
28:55 - You can go to Princeton and study liberal arts and get out and maybe make a lot less
29:02 - money than somebody who studied computer science at a public university and spent a small fraction
29:07 - of what you spent on your degree,
29:09 - But one thing I will tell you about these institutions is the actual major you study
29:16 - is much more important than where you study,
29:21 - Granted that if you just have a generic degree in anything from Harvard, that's probably
29:27 - better than having an engineering degree from a small-state school that nobody's heard of
29:31 - in terms of immediate earning potential coming out of college,
29:35 - But that difference is very quickly eroded in the marketplace,
29:42 - If you continue to progress as a software engineer, you can quickly outpace and outearn
29:47 - somebody who has an undergraduate degree from Columbia in film or something like that,
29:52 - So don't worry about which school you study at,
29:56 - I would just optimize for ROI,
29:58 - Unless you're getting a large scholarship or you have some sort of like your parents
30:01 - went to the school and you can get like a favorable deal going there, I would definitely
30:06 - prioritize going to public schools and I would definitely prioritize leveraging the community
30:12 - college to public university pipeline,
30:17 - So what's the optimal path through university?
30:21 - If you want to further reduce the cost of college education, if you're in high school,
30:25 - I recommend taking AP credits,
30:29 - You may hear AP physics, AP computer science, AP history,
30:35 - These can all potentially be turned into free college credit when you go into the university,
30:42 - You can essentially come into university with like up to a year's worth of college already
30:47 - done,
30:48 - Imagine going to college and instead of having to study for four years, you come in as a
30:52 - sophomore and you only have three years of study,
30:54 - You can potentially do that with AP, advanced placement,
30:59 - That's a system we have here in the United States and you can take those courses and
31:02 - take those exams here in the United States as a high school student and even after high
31:06 - school, you might be able to take some of those,
31:08 - But there's another thing that's very powerful that a lot, not as many people know about
31:12 - and that is CLEP,
31:14 - CLEP, I don't know what it stands for,
31:16 - I'm not going to look it up,
31:17 - It doesn't matter,
31:18 - Everybody just calls the CLEP,
31:19 - And what it is, you CLEP out of courses,
31:22 - You take an exam, you can read books, you can do whatever you want,
31:25 - If you already have some knowledge of a subject just from being casually interested in it,
31:28 - you may be able to pay $120, take the CLEP exam and then you don't have to take that
31:33 - course in university,
31:34 - So a lot of what we call gen ed, general education credits like history, like philosophy, like
31:43 - physics, you may have to take these courses depending on which university you study at,
31:48 - But if you CLEP out of those courses, you may not have to take them at all,
31:51 - You can save a ton of money and you can also save a lot of time because it may turn out
31:55 - that like sitting there like with a professor who's distracted with their, you know, research
32:00 - and doesn't even really care about teaching, it may be like a really, not every college
32:05 - course is amazing,
32:07 - That's one thing I'll tell you about course, about college is you may be shocked at how
32:11 - low quality of the product is for what you're paying for,
32:14 - I had a friend who was studying at NYU and she was paying $7,000 per course,
32:21 - If you're paying $7,000, this course is better to be pretty damn good if it's really just
32:25 - like one semester's worth of sitting among a whole bunch of other people in an auditorium
32:30 - learning from the professor, right?
32:32 - And frankly, not all of them are,
32:33 - And in a lot of cases, it is good to CLEP out of courses,
32:37 - So there are what I like to call ultra low cost, ultra low cost use,
32:51 - These are universities that are so much cheaper that it's like almost unfathomably cheap,
32:57 - And there are two that I really want to talk about, which is University of the People,
33:02 - And then there's Western Governors University,
33:05 - Now I should add, we do not have any sort of affiliate relationships with these institutions,
33:11 - Nobody from them is telling me like, Oh, please, Quincy, create a video where you pitch our
33:15 - universities,
33:16 - I'm just saying in terms of sheer ROI, these are a slam dunk, especially if you're going
33:24 - to be working, if you're not going to be able to attend a campus, if you're a non-traditional
33:28 - student, meaning you're like older than 25, you're going back to get your degree, you're
33:32 - probably going to be doing what we call night school, working at essentially remotely learning,
33:40 - So in those cases, it 100% makes sense to consider University of People or Western Governors
33:46 - University,
33:47 - In fact, I have lots of friends who attend both of these universities,
33:50 - So I can personally vouch that, you know, it's a degree,
33:54 - Now let me tell you how these work,
33:56 - So they both work different ways,
33:59 - University of the People, you just pay an assessment fee for each course,
34:04 - It's technically tuition free,
34:06 - And so you'll pay, I think, $120 to take the exam at the end of each course,
34:11 - And there's 40 courses, so you multiply 40 courses times 120,
34:16 - We can do that right here, 40 times 120,
34:24 - You get $480, $4,800,
34:30 - Imagine getting a degree from an accredited four year university for less than $5,000,
34:36 - It sounds too good to be true, but it's true,
34:39 - It's real,
34:40 - I have lots of friends who've done it,
34:43 - Western Governors University uses a slightly different system where you can basically take
34:47 - as many courses as you want per semester,
34:50 - And I think it's less than $10,000 to do an entire year there,
34:53 - And if you work really aggressively, you can potentially complete an entire degree in like
34:57 - a year, 18 months,
34:59 - So you could be spending, you know, $15,000, $10,000 and get a full accredited four year
35:06 - degree,
35:08 - How does accreditation work?
35:11 - Accreditation is essentially how universities police one another to make sure that they're
35:16 - not cutting corners,
35:17 - And it is kind of a peer review system,
35:20 - You'll have professors from one university go and visit another university and bless
35:24 - that program,
35:26 - So there are several different kinds of accreditation,
35:30 - There's what's called regional,
35:34 - There's what's called national,
35:41 - And then there's what's called programmatic,
35:45 - So the way that the most prestigious is regional,
35:48 - And that may sound like, huh, well, that's weird,
35:50 - Why would regional be more, you know, heavy in value than national?
35:56 - But it's much harder to get regional,
35:58 - So there's this organization called CHE the Council of Higher Education Accreditation,
36:16 - I think assessment or something like that,
36:18 - I can't remember the exact acronym, but this is the organization that blesses universities,
36:24 - And if you can get this accreditation, it's worth its weight in gold, essentially,
36:28 - It's like everybody will take your university seriously and you don't need to worry about
36:32 - being called a quote unquote diploma mill,
36:35 - Now people throw that term diploma mill around all the time,
36:37 - And I just want to give credit to the universities like a diploma mill,
36:42 - I consider that to be basically someplace where you mail in and you get a fake PhD,
36:46 - Right,
36:47 - You don't actually do any coursework,
36:48 - There are plenty of programs like that that are super sketchy,
36:52 - Never associate yourself with any of those,
36:55 - If you are found to have like a fake degree of any kind, it's career suicide, essentially,
37:00 - Don't do that,
37:02 - But there are also organizations that don't quite rise to that level of rigor, but are
37:08 - totally legit national accreditation,
37:12 - So this is like a lot of the private for profit universities get national accreditation as
37:17 - a little bit easier,
37:18 - And for example, both of those universities that I talked to about earlier, University
37:24 - of the People, Western Governors University, they get national accreditation,
37:27 - And this includes something like it's called DEAC accreditation,
37:35 - This is like regional distance education accreditation commission, I believe,
37:40 - So you might be able to get DEAC accreditation, which is a form of national accreditation,
37:46 - And if you get that, then you're basically a remote school that can be online,
37:51 - It's very, very common,
37:53 - I think both University of the People and Western Governors University started off with
37:58 - that accreditation and then moved to national accreditation or regional accreditation over
38:02 - time,
38:03 - There's a third type of accreditation called programmatic accreditation,
38:07 - Programmatic is if you're a nursing school, you're a law school, you're a medical school,
38:11 - you're doing a specific program and you just want that specific program accredited,
38:16 - Now business schools are like certain types of accreditation that are more prestigious
38:19 - in business schools,
38:20 - You can check,
38:22 - This is a good measure to make sure you're not getting ripped off as a student,
38:25 - But one thing I want you to keep in mind is you can be like a total terrible university
38:30 - and still technically be accredited,
38:32 - It's very hard to lose your accreditation,
38:34 - It rarely happens,
38:35 - So university might be good at one point, have get accredited and then may have a succession
38:41 - of leadership that kind of like strips the university for parts or cuts lots of corners
38:46 - and it could take decades for that university to lose this accreditation despite the fact
38:51 - that they've essentially been asleep at the wheel in terms of running that university,
38:55 - So do not look to accreditation as the sole arbiter of whether a university is good,
39:01 - What I recommend is reach out to the alumni,
39:05 - Hang out at an alumni function,
39:07 - If people are like, man, I'm so glad I studied at this school, like I've had this amazing
39:10 - career and I attribute, if people are like donating tons of money to the school, that's
39:14 - like a really good indication that it is a good school,
39:18 - So even though you understand now that I've given you this mini lecture on accreditation,
39:23 - just don't take it as, you know, it has some face value, but don't make accreditation be
39:30 - your shortcut to deciding, oh, the school's cool,
39:33 - Investigate,
39:34 - Your education may very well be the second largest investment in your life, presuming
39:39 - that you are able to afford enough money to buy a home here in the United States, which
39:44 - is probably going to be bigger than your education unless you go to a really expensive school,
39:47 - So just treat this as it's the second biggest investment in your life,
39:51 - One other thing I'll say is aside from transferring between community colleges and for your institutions,
39:56 - it's very hard to transfer credit,
39:58 - You don't want to make the wrong decision, go to a bad university, have to switch,
40:02 - A lot of the money you've spent will just basically be gone,
40:05 - You might be able to transfer in like a few classes, but you're probably going to have
40:09 - to retake a lot of those,
40:11 - So you definitely want to do your research and pick the right school first, and don't
40:16 - just pick the school that's like really close down the road, even if it's like a private
40:19 - for profit or a private nonprofit that charges an arm and a leg,
40:23 - Really drill into those outcomes and make sure that you're making a good decision as
40:27 - far as ROI,
40:29 - Again, above all else, if you're trying to get your money's worth, consider the return
40:34 - on investment,
40:36 - What are some traps people fall into?
40:38 - So there are several traps that people fall into,
40:42 - One I will call the passion trap,
40:46 - Passion,
40:48 - So you really like taking photos,
40:51 - You really want to go to school for photography and become a professional photographer,
40:58 - That is totally chill,
40:59 - I encourage you to pursue that passion, but I would not encourage you to attend a private
41:03 - for profit photography school, for example, or even a private nonprofit photography school,
41:08 - In fact, I wouldn't necessarily encourage you to pursue photography as a major at all,
41:14 - I would encourage you to continue to study, looking at professional photographers, studying
41:21 - their work, studying other things, because if you get a major in photography, it doesn't
41:27 - really matter for most gigs that you're going to be working as a photographer,
41:30 - It's not like the person is going to be like, oh, where did you study?
41:33 - They're going to be like, show me your portfolio, show me your work or who recommended you,
41:37 - Those kinds of things,
41:38 - There are certain fields where a college degree doesn't really matter unless you're trying
41:42 - to become a professor in that field,
41:44 - And I will tell you that academia is very dysfunctional,
41:47 - We call it the academic pyramid scheme for every Ph,D, or for every tenure track,
41:56 - We'll just call this tenure,
42:01 - In the U,S,, there are 50 X Ph,D,s trying to get up there, trying to climb the pyramid
42:09 - to get to the top,
42:10 - It's very difficult to get this coveted tenure track position at a university,
42:16 - So academia, don't play that game,
42:19 - Unless you're really confident or you're just studying a field where you're going to want
42:22 - to get a Ph,D, anyway, like physics, I would not continue to study,
42:26 - I think so many people spend years studying their Ph,D, before they realize, man, I really
42:31 - don't like this and they churn out a Ph,D, program,
42:34 - So anyway, I know this isn't about Ph,D, programs, but I'll just take this moment to tell you
42:38 - that academia is kind of a pyramid scheme and everybody kind of knows it and they play
42:43 - the game anyway because it's like playing the lottery,
42:45 - If you get that tenure track position, if you're able to live that life of mind and
42:49 - be a professor and do cool, interesting research, you're going to meet lots of professors who
42:54 - are like, oh, of course, like it's worth it,
42:56 - I had a great time,
42:57 - It's not that big, it's not a pyramid scheme, but keep in mind that for every person who
43:02 - entered into a Ph,D, program, hopefully trying to become an academic, there are 49 other
43:08 - people who did not make it, right?
43:11 - So just keep that in mind,
43:15 - So that's trap number one,
43:17 - Trap number two would be micromanaging,
43:24 - So you're going to look at U,S, News World Report and you're going to see all of these
43:29 - data everywhere,
43:30 - Oh my goodness, there's so much data,
43:32 - Like I'm going to be the most informed, I'm going to make the most educated decision anybody's
43:37 - ever made about where to study,
43:40 - And I will tell you, none of that stuff really matters that much,
43:42 - Those data are probably spurious at best because they're not taking into account a whole lot
43:46 - of different things like the socio-economic background of the people who studied at school,
43:51 - Of course, people at Ivy League schools generally have better outcomes because their parents
43:55 - are probably rich and the best predictor of your own success is how successful your
44:00 - parents were,
44:01 - You know, don't hate the player, hate the game, as I like to say,
44:05 - Like I'm not trying to pick on specific universities, but I'm just saying, of course, if you drill
44:10 - into the information, and I think this is a neurosis, you've got in countries like
44:15 - India and China, you've got people that are studying extremely hard to try to get into
44:20 - this coveted like top tier of universities thinking that's the only path forward,
44:25 - Like I've got to get into Harvard, I've got to get into MIT, but I'm here to tell you,
44:29 - if you study at a good state school and you study hard and you go out and you get a good
44:33 - job and you continue to progress through your field, you can be in as good or better position
44:38 - than those people that worked so hard to get into these extremely selective institutions,
44:43 - So that would be what I call the micromanagement trap,
44:47 - Don't think that just because the data say, oh, you should go to Harvard, never get that
44:51 - kind of Harvard or bust mentality,
44:53 - Look at other options,
44:56 - So I think that this kind of breaks down when you're looking at good public institutions
45:00 - because they are much more reasonably priced, you're much more likely to have a higher ROI,
45:06 - So the third trap is I see people think like, I don't care about money, right?
45:15 - Like I was like this,
45:17 - I worked at Taco Bell, I worked construction, I worked at grocery stores, I worked at convenience
45:21 - stores, I just did odd jobs and I read books and I just hung out and I was totally cool
45:25 - with that,
45:27 - And I didn't care about university because I didn't care about money,
45:31 - Like so many of the best things in life were completely free,
45:34 - Hanging out with your friends, reading books, going for a walk in the park and it can be
45:39 - very easy to think like, oh, minimum wage is fine, I'll just make do, I can sleep on
45:46 - a mattress on the floor and I can have my bookshelf made out of concrete blocks and
45:49 - it's totally chill,
45:51 - I'm here to tell you that that is a totally viable strategy to get you through your 20s,
45:56 - maybe even your 30s,
45:57 - But if you have a kid, if you get diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, if you find out that
46:05 - your parents have cancer, any number of different things that can come up, the US healthcare
46:12 - system is not going to save you,
46:13 - US welfare system is practically non-existent,
46:17 - You are going to be screwed really badly if you don't plan ahead and the best way to plan
46:21 - ahead is to make money, even if you're living well below your means,
46:26 - And I can tell you, I know lots of people who make lots of money as software engineers
46:30 - who do not drive Ferraris and do not have Park Avenue apartments, they are living well
46:37 - within their means and they're just taking that money and they're putting it into an
46:40 - index fund and they're just letting compound interest, the most powerful force in the universe
46:45 - according to Albert Einstein, compound interest,
46:49 - Put some money into the stock market in a sensible way,
46:51 - Again, I just recommend index funds because there's no management cost really,
46:55 - It's negligible,
46:56 - It's like four or five basis points and just let that money sit there and let it do dollar
47:03 - cost averaging if you want where every day it takes out a certain amount of money so
47:06 - you don't have to think about it and just earn that money and then if you ever need
47:09 - it, you have a whole lot of money there,
47:11 - Why not?
47:12 - There's never a situation where having a lot of money is worse than not having money,
47:17 - It's an absolute advantage in terms of the curve balls that life can throw your way,
47:21 - So I just want to emphasize that even if you don't care about money, it is a rational thing
47:27 - to go to college and try to maximize your earning power so that if you don't care about
47:32 - money, you can push a broom as a janitor, which I did, push a mop around, clean up the
47:38 - grocery store, or you could be just doing some knowledge worker job that pays twice
47:42 - as much,
47:43 - That isn't significantly more exerting mentally or physically and just accruing money that
47:50 - you'll have in case you need it,
47:52 - So I genuinely believe that like take this, I don't care about money thing,
47:56 - I know it can sound cool to just be aloof and not care and stuff like that, but at the
48:01 - end of the day, it is a very good thing to have money,
48:03 - I'm not saying you need to become a hundred millionaire or anything like that,
48:07 - I'm just saying to become middle class and to save money and to reduce your risk later
48:14 - in life,
48:15 - And it would be very cool to retire at some point, right?
48:19 - You may not think like, oh, I love working,
48:20 - I don't think I'll ever need to retire, but you may very well change your mind when you're
48:24 - getting older or you get diagnosed with repetitive stress syndrome or you're having insomnia
48:30 - because your sleep's broken down over the years or you're experiencing vertigo or any
48:33 - number of different things that can just suddenly come out of nowhere and start making it much
48:37 - harder to work,
48:39 - So these would be, I think my three traps, just to recap studying what you're passionate
48:45 - about as opposed to studying something that has a higher ROI,
48:48 - As I've established, computer science has the highest ROI,
48:50 - I don't think that's going to change anytime soon,
48:53 - Micro managing your studies and focusing too much on data and not seeing the forest for
48:59 - the trees and not thinking that college is important and not planning for the future,
49:05 - I think as long as you avoid these three traps, you're going to find yourself in a much better
49:08 - situation and you're going to incur a lot less risk and you're probably going to incur
49:12 - a lot less debt,
49:15 - Don't a lot of entrepreneurs drop out?
49:18 - So a lot of entrepreneurs drop out of college, but not a lot of entrepreneurs succeed,
49:23 - Of course, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, you can probably think of lots of famous people
49:30 - who've dropped out of school and then gone on to become billionaires,
49:36 - And the thing to note about that is they are outliers just by virtue of their extreme success,
49:42 - They're already outliers,
49:44 - But in practice, like we looked at the, I'll show it again, the Fortune 500 CEOs,
49:49 - I think virtually every one of these CEOs has a degree,
49:53 - There are sometimes companies that are founded by people who drop out of college, but it's
49:59 - much less common,
50:00 - Now I'm going to tell you right now, there's a trope,
50:05 - You can get a job without a degree, right?
50:07 - Like Google, Apple, all these companies coming out and saying, you don't need a degree to
50:17 - work here anymore,
50:19 - But I challenge you to walk around the Googleplex or the Apple campus and ask people like,
50:24 - hey, do you have a degree?
50:25 - Do you have a degree?
50:26 - You might walk around all day without finding somebody who doesn't have a degree,
50:29 - Yes, technically you can get a job at Apple if you don't have a degree,
50:33 - You can get a job at Google if you don't have a degree, but you probably need to be some
50:38 - open source superstar or you need to have like 10 years of sysadmin experience,
50:43 - There are so many ways that you can get good enough at software development that you could
50:47 - work at a big tech company without a degree,
50:50 - But it's rare that somebody just gets hired straight out of high school into such a role
50:55 - because getting a degree, first of all, it shows that you have the fortitude to actually
50:59 - finish the degree, which is not easy,
51:02 - And two, it shows that you think long-term and that you've made that investment in yourself,
51:07 - And three, it's just like a general way of de-risking people and almost every one of
51:12 - these companies, regardless of what they say publicly, they're going to have an HR department
51:16 - and they're going to list, maybe they don't put the university degree requirement in their
51:19 - job posting, but I guarantee you that the HR people that use filtering software, that's
51:24 - going to be one of the factors that they look at when they determine which resume is to
51:28 - review and which people to interview,
51:30 - It's probably going to be weighted,
51:31 - Maybe the degree is only worth like three or four points out of like 20 points that
51:34 - they would consider, but it is a consideration,
51:38 - And I will tell you, like Free Code Camp, I think we have probably at least five or
51:43 - six people on our team of 35 people who do not have a university degree, but we also
51:48 - have several people who have PhDs, right?
51:50 - So like educational, it depends so much on the individual,
51:56 - There are so many considerations, but Free Code Camp is one of the most adventurous institutions
52:00 - in terms of hiring people who don't have university degrees for coveted remote knowledge worker
52:05 - jobs,
52:06 - In practice, most companies are going to be much more careful about that,
52:10 - So if you drop out because your company is getting millions of dollars in seed funding
52:16 - or you've gotten a whole bunch of clients and you don't feel like you need to go to
52:19 - school anymore, that is totally legitimate,
52:21 - I can totally see why if your career is taking off and college is a distraction, you can
52:26 - drop out,
52:27 - And in fact, some institutions like Stanford have like a rule that like you can basically
52:31 - come back anytime you want and just pick back up your studies,
52:34 - Other institutions, if you're gone for a certain number of years, your credits kind of expire
52:38 - and you have to start at the beginning, right?
52:40 - So you'll want to look at those considerations, but really, unless you're getting some sort
52:45 - of crazy product market fit, some sort of crazy traction with your startup, or unless
52:50 - some really rich person like offered you a job to like be their kind of personal assistant
52:56 - or to build some product for them or something like that, I would not leave college for that,
53:01 - Now again, if you study at Stanford or if you study at a university that's more permissive
53:06 - and porous as far as coming in and out, you could take a gap year,
53:10 - That's totally fine, but I would recommend at some point going back and completing your
53:14 - degree even if that's just to go and complete a degree at University of the People or Western
53:20 - Governors University,
53:22 - So as you can tell, I'm very much in the college degree is important camp,
53:27 - You're not going to see me trashing college degree or running Google ads and say like,
53:32 - Hey, you don't need a degree,
53:33 - Just go to a free code camp,
53:35 - I don't believe that at all,
53:36 - I believe very much in the benefit of a college education,
53:40 - I myself have a college education,
53:42 - I even went to a grad school,
53:44 - Most of my friends went to college,
53:47 - Whenever you hear some wealthy person say, Oh, you don't need to go to college anymore,
53:51 - Just ask yourself, does that person have a college degree?
53:53 - Like, can they really say that objectively because a lot of times people forget all the
53:59 - things that they learned in college that did help them or they don't see the invisible
54:02 - benefit of just having HR people not filter you out because you don't have a degree and
54:07 - getting so many more job interviews and things like that,
54:09 - So I believe so strongly that everybody should get a degree and I believe that most people
54:14 - who are going to school today should probably get a degree in computer science because it's
54:17 - so flexible,
54:18 - It's the Swiss army knife of tech degrees,
54:20 - What about free code camps degree program?
54:24 - I'm very hardened at the ultra low cost universities that I was talking about earlier, University
54:30 - of the people, Western governors university, and how they've dramatically reduced the cost
54:35 - of being able to get an accredited us university degree,
54:40 - I don't think that they've done enough,
54:41 - I think education wants to be free,
54:45 - It wants for everybody to be able to benefit from it,
54:48 - And if you really want to make something that everybody can benefit from, you need to make
54:53 - it free,
54:54 - Think about the 60% of people on earth who live off less than $10 a day,
55:00 - Think about all the people who are outside of the United States who are not likely to
55:04 - be able to save up enough money to come to the US who are not likely to be able to get
55:07 - a US visa, who are living in a rural village in India, who are doing subsistence farming
55:16 - in a rural China, Chinese town, or living in a favela in Brazil,
55:23 - Those people, those families, they're not going to be able to send their kids to learn
55:28 - in the United States,
55:29 - But you know what they might be able to do?
55:38 - They might be able to do free code camp,
55:41 - So we're developing a 40-course undergraduate degree,
55:46 - So it's an associate's degree in mathematics and a bachelor's degree in computer science,
55:51 - And it will take you through everything you need,
55:53 - There are no electives,
55:54 - There are no prerequisites,
55:55 - You just start at the top and you progress through these 40 university courses,
56:00 - And it's going to be a whole lot of coursework,
56:02 - It's going to take several years for most people if they're learning part-time,
56:05 - But they'll be able to do it at their own pace for free,
56:08 - They'll be able to work through all the labs,
56:09 - They'll be able to take all the final exams,
56:12 - And they'll be able to get a degree from a university that will eventually be accredited,
56:17 - It will take until the early 2030s to finish developing all these courses,
56:21 - We've already published one of them and we're going to be publishing a lot more soon,
56:26 - And then after we publish the entire degree, people have gone through the program, gotten
56:29 - the degree,
56:30 - It'll still take some time for us to have enough longitudinal data to be able to get
56:36 - accredited by one of the big national accreditation agencies,
56:39 - But that is what we've committed to and we're making steady progress toward it,
56:43 - I think it's absolutely vital that we teach the correct current skills,
56:50 - So you're going to see not only that we teach eight courses of engineering math, which I
56:54 - think mathematics is incredibly important, especially if you want to get into like machine
56:59 - learning,
57:00 - We also want to teach security,
57:02 - We want to teach ethics,
57:03 - We want to teach a whole lot of general ed credit that a university would traditionally
57:08 - have, epistemology, topics like that,
57:11 - And we want to teach it in a way that you can progress,
57:15 - Get an associate degree halfway through and then you can progress if you'd like and get
57:19 - the full bachelor's degree at the end,
57:23 - Our thinking is we want the most middle-of-the-road, conventional university degree we can,
57:28 - We've looked at the top 20 computer science degree programs in the United States, MIT,
57:32 - Caltech, Harvey Mudd, Stanford,
57:36 - We've looked at how their universities are configured in terms of the courses that people
57:43 - take as part of their degree programs,
57:46 - And we've essentially made a composite degree that hits all those highlights and it's again,
57:51 - it's the most middle-of-the-road computer science degree you can imagine if you're just
57:55 - looking at top universities that are likely to turn out graduates who are likely to work
58:01 - in industry at big tech or potentially get jobs at banks, hospitals, lots of developer
58:11 - jobs,
58:12 - Most software developer jobs are not in big tech, they're in other ancillary industries,
58:18 - And also, of course, many of those people that study those computer science programs
58:22 - go on to found startups to get venture capital funding or to be able to bootstrap to success,
58:28 - And so we're going to be focused on just giving people the skills that they'll have the optionality
58:33 - to work freelance, to work in big tech, to work at a smaller regional company or to potentially
58:39 - build a startup,
58:42 - What determines job compensation?
58:45 - Right,
58:46 - So compensation, how much money you're making for your time, and that's a way to think of
58:52 - getting compensated is essentially you're selling your time to an employer and they're
58:55 - paying you for that time,
58:58 - It's a buying and selling process, right?
59:00 - So of course, first is just labor market economics,
59:05 - You have your supply, you have your demand, and then you have your price here in the middle,
59:12 - So it depends a lot on what the market is like in terms of the overall economy and things
59:19 - like that,
59:20 - If there are a lot more people that are looking for jobs than there are jobs available, employers
59:25 - can afford to pay less and things like that,
59:27 - So just keep in mind economics, right?
59:31 - That's one,
59:32 - Two, skills,
59:35 - So one of the reasons that doctors get paid so much money in the United States is because
59:41 - it takes a lot of work to become a doctor,
59:44 - After you finish high school, you've got to go to college,
59:46 - Then you have to get into medical school,
59:48 - That's another four years,
59:49 - Then after you finish medical school, you have to do three to five years of residency
59:54 - where you work with other physicians and basically are supervised,
59:57 - And then you can become fully cool to go start your own practice or work for a big hospital
60:03 - chain or whatever you want to do as an independent physician,
60:05 - So if you think about that, that's so much additional,
60:07 - It's like 12 extra years of education that you need to get before you can do it to build
60:11 - up those skills,
60:12 - So naturally, you're going to want to be compensated more,
60:14 - And so physicians tend to be compensated more,
60:17 - Software engineering, same way,
60:18 - You have to study computer science and you have to build up your skills and prove your
60:22 - skills,
60:23 - But the difference between a developer who just got out and maybe is making like 50,
60:28 - 60, $70,000 as a software engineer and an engineer that's working on recommendation
60:34 - algorithms at Google, I mean, they could just be an engineer without any charges, people
60:40 - who are working under them,
60:41 - They could be an IC, an individual contributor, and they could be making a million dollars
60:45 - a year in compensation as a software engineer, right?
60:48 - And it comes down to skills and their ability,
60:51 - Three, working conditions,
60:57 - So let's think about working in what would traditionally be called a sweatshop,
61:01 - Like you might be in circumstances that are literally illegal, doing piecework, having
61:06 - a boss who's lording over you, having dangerous machines that you're like a loom or sewing
61:14 - machine or something like that that you can get hurt on, right?
61:17 - To some extent by getting better working conditions, being able to work in an air conditioned office
61:24 - or being able to work at home as a remote worker, like those are kind of forms of compensation,
61:29 - And often that, like your compensation will be slightly lower if you have like a posh
61:33 - situation where you can be sitting down all day, for example,
61:37 - And then four, of course, danger,
61:40 - So the most dangerous jobs in the United States are working as a lumberjack, working on cell
61:46 - phone towers, where you could potentially fall to your death if there's a mistake,
61:50 - There are so many different jobs that you get compensated because they know that you
61:55 - could physically get injured or killed doing the job,
61:59 - Being a trucker is a very dangerous job, and it's very demanding physically to be sitting
62:03 - there all day,
62:04 - I mean, it's wearing out your back,
62:07 - You may have to have a lot of sleepless nights to deliver your load on time,
62:11 - So those four things all determine compensation to an extent,
62:16 - But the one thing that you had the most control over, you can't really control this at all,
62:22 - Working conditions, you just need a certain floor for your working conditions and your
62:25 - probably good,
62:27 - Some people might be willing to work in more hostile conditions like, let's say, going
62:32 - and working in a war zone or something like that to increase your compensation,
62:35 - Again, that also kind of feeds into danger a little bit,
62:38 - But really, what can you control?
62:41 - You can control your skills,
62:42 - And that's probably the most rational thing to optimize, is trying to get as high skills
62:47 - as possible,
62:48 - And that's why I would encourage people to learn software engineering and programming
62:52 - because it's a very remunerative skill set to have,
63:00 - So first, I want to say thank you for hearing me out, for listening to my opinions on a
63:05 - lot of these different things,
63:06 - I hope they're relevant to you,
63:08 - I want to encourage you to continue developing skills,
63:14 - You don't have to go to university to learn these skills,
63:18 - You certainly don't have to go back to university and get a master's degree,
63:22 - And we didn't really even talk about master's degrees,
63:23 - I do have a master's degree,
63:24 - I have an MBA,
63:25 - I have a lot of friends who have master's degrees,
63:28 - In general, I'll pull up the chart again,
63:31 - In general, you do make more compensation for getting a master's degree,
63:34 - But if you look at the difference between having a bachelor's degree, having a master's
63:37 - degree, and having a bachelor's degree, and no degree, it's dramatic,
63:41 - Like you double your income for getting a master's degree,
63:44 - And you may be like get an extra 10%, 15% of income if you get a master's degree, depending
63:49 - on what you get the master's degree in,
63:51 - You may be able to get somebody to pay to send you back to get a master's degree later
63:56 - in life,
63:57 - Like your employer might do that as a perk and say, oh, we'll pay for you to get an MBA
64:01 - or we'll pay for you to get a master's in computer science,
64:03 - If you can do that, go for it,
64:04 - I think it's great if you're not going to pay for it,
64:06 - But I don't think the ROI is necessarily there,
64:08 - So I would encourage you to continue to learn your skills through free Code Camp,
64:12 - One question that we didn't get into is if you already have a university degree, should
64:16 - you go back and get a second undergraduate degree?
64:18 - And I would say in like 99% of cases, that's not worth it,
64:23 - Just learn to code on your own, self-teach,
64:25 - There are literally millions of people who are self-teaching,
64:29 - There are tens of thousands of people that I know of who I've directly confirmed have
64:33 - gotten their first software development job after finishing free Code Camp,
64:37 - And many of those people did not have a degree,
64:39 - Also I'll tell you that if you listen to the free Code Camp podcast, which I host each
64:43 - week, just go in your podcast player of choice and search free Code Camp and you'll find
64:47 - my podcast, I talk to a lot of people who don't have university degrees who are doing
64:51 - just fine as software engineers,
64:53 - So everything I've said here, there are always exceptions,
64:57 - I think in terms of maximizing your likelihood of being able to earn a living, to provide
65:02 - for your family, to have a clear forward and upward career trajectory, getting an undergraduate
65:09 - degree is the correct thing to do,
65:11 - I think getting it as inexpensively as you can, doing in-state tuition, doing community
65:19 - college clapping and AP crediting out of certain courses or doing an ultra low cost for your
65:26 - university,
65:27 - I think anything you can do to reduce your cost is by definition going to increase your
65:32 - ROI and any money you can save today and invest is going to compound over time,
65:37 - So really, in my opinion, I just recommend going to the cheapest state school you can
65:43 - go to that's reasonably good and I strongly recommend studying computer science over other
65:49 - majors just because, as I said, it's the Swiss Army Knife of undergraduate university degrees,
65:55 - So with that, I hope this course has been helpful for you,
65:58 - I hope you've learned a lot,
65:59 - If you're not familiar with the free Code Camp channel, we've got tons of amazing courses,
66:04 - like more than a thousand courses on very specific technologies,
66:07 - They're not usually some dude standing at a whiteboard talking a whole lot,
66:11 - Usually they're interactive coding sessions, but I think you'll find them to be very helpful,
66:17 - Just remember that you don't have to pay a penny to learn to code,
66:20 - You don't need to have a credit card,
66:21 - You don't need to get a visa to come to the US to work at these hallowed halls of these
66:26 - big tech companies or anything like that,
66:28 - You don't need to go to a 400 year old university to be educated,
66:33 - You can educate yourself,
66:35 - You can learn whatever you need going to free Code Camp and using other free learning resources,
66:40 - using other videos here on YouTube,
66:41 - There are so many amazing teachers here that will teach you everything you need to know,
66:46 - You just have to be curious and you just have to put in the time and the energy to learn,
66:51 - With that, happy coding,
