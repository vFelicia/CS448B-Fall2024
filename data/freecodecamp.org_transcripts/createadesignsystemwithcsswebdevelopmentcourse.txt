00:00 - in this course you will learn how to
00:01 - build your own design system and improve
00:03 - your front-end development skills while
00:05 - building a space travel website with css
00:08 - guru kevin powell
00:12 - i am so excited to be presenting you
00:14 - this project our space tourism project
00:16 - that we'll be doing together here's an
00:18 - example or i mean we could look at this
00:20 - and just look at some screenshots and
00:21 - these are the different pages we're
00:23 - going to be looking at or of course we
00:24 - can just come here and see the actual
00:26 - page that we're going to be building and
00:28 - to see the different things and how they
00:29 - work and if you are in scrimba right now
00:32 - and you'd like to jump on in and
00:34 - actually come in and play with this code
00:35 - this is available to you you can see the
00:37 - finished result and play around with it
00:39 - of what we'll be doing and then when
00:41 - you're done you hit play and then i'll
00:42 - get back to introducing the course to
00:44 - you so
00:46 - yeah those are the pages that we'll be
00:47 - looking at of course it will be fully
00:49 - responsive and as we just saw there are
00:51 - some interactive elements as well with
00:53 - these tab type systems that we will be
00:55 - building out
00:56 - before i get any further into what we're
00:58 - going to be doing and how we're going to
01:00 - be doing it though i want to let you
01:01 - know that this course is a collaboration
01:04 - between front-end mentor scrimba as well
01:06 - as myself kevin powell and one thing
01:08 - before we do get started this course is
01:10 - not for people at the very beginning of
01:12 - their front-end journey having a good
01:14 - base in html is really going to help as
01:16 - well as experience having already
01:18 - created responsive layouts with css i'm
01:20 - not saying that you need to be an expert
01:22 - in creating layouts we're going to be
01:23 - breaking things down as much as we can
01:25 - but i am assuming previous knowledge of
01:27 - using css and html so i'll break it down
01:30 - as much as i can and i'll be challenging
01:32 - you along the way as well
01:34 - to help reinforce what we're learning to
01:36 - make sure you have a proper
01:37 - understanding of it but if you're new to
01:40 - html and css i do think you'd become a
01:42 - little bit lost along the way so this
01:44 - could be something fun to come back to
01:45 - later once you feel comfortable making a
01:47 - more complex page also if you do have a
01:50 - base in javascript or you're comfortable
01:52 - in javascript it will definitely be
01:53 - helpful but though it is not a
01:54 - prerequisite though when we do get into
01:56 - the javascript parts at least a basic
01:58 - understanding of it will go a really
01:59 - long way but you could build out this
02:01 - entire project with very little
02:03 - javascript if you wanted to and that's
02:05 - because there are a lot of different
02:06 - ways that you can actually approach this
02:08 - project you could build it only with
02:10 - html css and a touch of javascript or if
02:13 - you're more experienced or you've been
02:14 - learning something like react or vue or
02:16 - maybe even a static site generator you
02:18 - don't have to follow along exactly like
02:20 - i'm doing this i would actually
02:21 - encourage you not to follow along
02:23 - exactly as i'm doing things so if you've
02:25 - just learned a new framework or in the
02:27 - middle of learning a framework or a
02:28 - static site generator you can definitely
02:30 - use this as a really good project to
02:32 - help reinforce those skills and of
02:34 - course there is a whole middle ground to
02:35 - this as well which is more where i'm
02:37 - going to be focusing things where we're
02:38 - going to be using vanilla html css and
02:41 - javascript but we're going to be sort of
02:43 - going a little bit deeper than a touch
02:44 - of js to build in a little bit more
02:46 - interactivity into this project some of
02:48 - the main topics that we will be doing
02:49 - and one of the very very big topics of
02:51 - this entire course is building out a css
02:53 - design system and to do this we're going
02:55 - to be creating a lot of our own utility
02:57 - classes as well as using a lot of custom
02:59 - properties creating your own css design
03:01 - system it can seem like a lot of setup
03:03 - but it's one of those things that in the
03:04 - real world would be a really useful
03:06 - thing to have because then everything
03:08 - else can come together really fast i'm
03:10 - also going to talk about the balance
03:11 - between utility classes and component
03:13 - styles and things like that
03:15 - and the usefulness of custom properties
03:17 - in both of them so we're going to be
03:19 - diving pretty deep into that world at
03:21 - the beginning of the course for the
03:22 - layout we're going to be using both
03:24 - flexbox and grid for this neither one of
03:26 - them will be too complex but at least a
03:28 - basic understanding of both of them
03:29 - could really help you out and it's one
03:31 - of those things that if you don't have
03:33 - experience with grid it could be a nice
03:34 - introduction to it because we're not
03:36 - doing anything too complex but we are
03:38 - using some grid lines in some areas and
03:40 - we will also be using grid areas as well
03:42 - another really important thing for me in
03:44 - this course is to look at the
03:46 - accessibility of the site that we're
03:47 - going to be building so throughout the
03:49 - course i will be bringing up and
03:51 - mentioning accessibility we're going to
03:52 - be slowly adding in accessibility
03:54 - through the course so sometimes i might
03:56 - even do things in a less than ideal way
03:58 - and that are sort of the common ways
04:00 - that we see things done and then as we
04:02 - go through the course i'm going to be
04:03 - adding the accessibility into it and
04:05 - making small tweaks to what we've
04:07 - already created so this is going to
04:08 - include just writing proper semantic
04:10 - html as well as getting into role
04:13 - attributes and area and other things
04:15 - like that we won't be going in so deep
04:17 - that it's going to feel overwhelming i
04:18 - want to show you that proper
04:19 - accessibility can be added to a project
04:21 - without things having to be very complex
04:23 - all that out of the way it is time to
04:24 - get into the project itself i would
04:26 - really encourage you to head on over to
04:27 - front end mentor because this challenge
04:29 - as we've mentioned already is being
04:31 - provided by them and it is part of their
04:33 - new free plus category which means that
04:36 - everything you could need for this
04:37 - challenge is included for free including
04:39 - all the assets jpeg design files for
04:41 - both mobile and desktop and the sketch
04:43 - and figma design files so you can click
04:45 - on over and you can get access to all of
04:47 - that you can download the starter files
04:49 - and you can also get the sketch and
04:51 - figma files that you can download from
04:53 - here just really quick i use figma
04:55 - personally so throughout this course i
04:56 - might be saying you can reference this
04:58 - in the figma file of course if you're in
05:00 - sketch you can also reference it from
05:02 - the sketch file as well but i do say
05:04 - figma most of the time when i'm
05:06 - referring to them and if you do want to
05:07 - jump in and you can just click on this
05:09 - link that is right here in this slide
05:10 - and it should bring you to the challenge
05:13 - page where you can get the starter code
05:14 - and the sketch files you'll notice
05:16 - there's also a submit solution button
05:17 - right here which means when you're done
05:18 - with this challenge or any other
05:20 - challenges on front end mentor you can
05:22 - submit your solution you can also see
05:24 - other people's solutions and you can
05:25 - share the link of yours with others to
05:27 - get feedback on your solution that
05:29 - you've managed to come up with and so
05:31 - you can access these files on front-end
05:33 - mentor this link will bring you right to
05:34 - that challenge as well and i've also
05:36 - created a github repo that you can
05:37 - access the files for so if you're
05:39 - following along this course with files
05:40 - on your computer instead of following
05:42 - along with the files here on scrimba you
05:44 - can download everything from the github
05:45 - repo and it's also going to have the
05:47 - start and ending stage of every one of
05:49 - the lessons in this course because as i
05:51 - said i'm going to be offering challenges
05:52 - throughout the course so that way if
05:54 - you're not following my exact code you
05:55 - are doing things in a little bit of a
05:57 - different way you'll be able to get the
05:58 - exact code we have for that challenge at
06:00 - any given time through the github repo
06:02 - but now it is time to jump into the
06:04 - actual project itself and get started
06:06 - with it i'm really looking forward to
06:07 - this i hope you are as well let's go do
06:09 - this
06:12 - all right so as i mentioned in the
06:13 - introduction the first thing we are
06:15 - going to be doing is focusing on the
06:17 - design system itself and that design
06:20 - system has been provided to us from
06:22 - front end mentor we can see it here on
06:24 - this slide and this is what we're going
06:26 - to start by building because it gives us
06:28 - an overview of the styling we need for
06:30 - our entire project or at least most of
06:32 - it anyway so rather than trying to style
06:34 - everything page by page we can design
06:36 - this design system which is going to
06:38 - allow us to work really fast when we
06:40 - want to start working on the actual
06:42 - pages
06:43 - so how i'm going to be approaching this
06:45 - first of all is i'm going to be using a
06:47 - lot of custom properties because they're
06:48 - absolutely the best and allow us to work
06:50 - really well and i'm going to show you a
06:51 - few cool things that we can do with
06:53 - custom properties to
06:55 - sort of open up extra doors and things
06:56 - like that along the way we're also going
06:58 - to be using a lot of utility classes
07:00 - because even though it takes a little
07:01 - bit of time to set them up they allow us
07:03 - to save a lot of time in the long run
07:06 - the one thing this design system that
07:07 - front end mentor has provided us with is
07:09 - it has all the things we need other than
07:11 - the layout so i'm not going to worry too
07:12 - much about the layout even though we can
07:14 - make a few quick columns and other
07:15 - things like that along the way and
07:17 - lastly when we're finished with it like
07:19 - we won't have all the layout parts that
07:20 - we need we won't have everything
07:22 - completely done but we're really going
07:23 - to be off to a running start and it's
07:25 - going to enable us to work so much
07:27 - faster so we're almost ready to dive in
07:30 - the first thing we're going to do is
07:31 - create a general reset just because css
07:33 - as you might know comes with a few
07:35 - little things along the way that can be
07:36 - kind of annoying so before we even worry
07:39 - about the document itself we're going to
07:40 - create a general reset then we're going
07:42 - to create some generic utility classes
07:44 - that i just create on every single
07:45 - project then finally we're going to dive
07:47 - into creating the design system itself
07:49 - and we're going to break down everything
07:51 - into multiple lessons it's not going to
07:52 - be one big giant thing i'm going to have
07:54 - lots of challenges for you along the way
07:56 - to be taking steps and seeing what you
07:57 - can do
07:58 - and then i'll be giving solutions to
08:00 - those as well as we go through all this
08:01 - and one really important thing to start
08:03 - with is we're really starting with blank
08:04 - files we have nothing here to start with
08:06 - i haven't brought in the assets or
08:07 - anything like that yet because we don't
08:09 - need them we'll bring all of that in
08:10 - later in the project but one thing i
08:12 - have done just in case you want to make
08:14 - your life a little bit easier i have
08:16 - included this preview.html file in the
08:19 - design system so if you go into this one
08:21 - and you just hit run or hit save it
08:23 - should load it up and you can preview
08:25 - what the design system looks like here
08:27 - if you need to get font sizes or get
08:29 - other things from it because sometimes
08:30 - when you're looking at it in the slides
08:32 - my screenshots might be a little bit
08:34 - small but of course this is just a jpeg
08:36 - you can't copy and paste things or
08:37 - anything like that so if you want to be
08:39 - able to work a little bit faster copy
08:41 - and paste text you can do all of that
08:43 - from either the sketch or figma file
08:45 - which is being provided by front end
08:46 - mentor so you know that might be a
08:48 - little bit easier of a way to work but
08:50 - if ever you need to reference something
08:51 - really quickly you can reference this
08:53 - preview.html file if you just need to
08:55 - grab a few values or something like that
08:57 - i know i'm anxious to start writing some
08:59 - code so i'm sure you are too so in the
09:00 - next lesson we're going to be doing just
09:02 - that
09:04 - all right so it's time to work on our
09:06 - reset and so for that all of the css i'm
09:09 - writing now is going to go just in my
09:10 - index.css file because this is the one
09:13 - that will be controlling our entire site
09:15 - we're using this across all of our pages
09:17 - and if you don't already know what a
09:18 - reset is for it is something that just
09:20 - helps us make sure we're starting on a
09:22 - good base before we really get into
09:24 - anything and i'm going to write a few
09:26 - things here and then i'm actually going
09:27 - to encourage you to see if you can think
09:29 - of a few things you'd want to reset
09:30 - along the way as well and so the very
09:32 - first thing i am going to do though is
09:34 - create a comment here at the top so i
09:35 - can do that you can just write out the
09:37 - comment thing or you can use ctrl
09:38 - forward slash and that will set this up
09:41 - and i'm going to put a whole bunch of uh
09:42 - dots here because this is sort of our
09:44 - dashes i should say as this is going to
09:46 - create a section for us and here i'm
09:48 - just going to write reset if you're on a
09:50 - mac it's probably um command and forward
09:53 - slash will give you that as well and
09:55 - then we can create our reset section
09:57 - here this just makes it a little bit
09:59 - easier when we're going through our css
10:01 - file which might get a little bit big to
10:03 - keep track of everything we're doing and
10:06 - the first one i'm going to do and if you
10:07 - want to take a guess at what it might be
10:09 - before i start it's one of the things i
10:10 - do on absolutely every single site i
10:13 - ever work on which is my box sizing and
10:16 - that is setting my star and then as well
10:19 - as my star before we're going to be
10:21 - using quite a few pseudo elements in
10:23 - this so resetting the box sizing on the
10:26 - pseudo-elements is important because it
10:27 - will even though we've selected
10:29 - everything with the star selector it
10:31 - does not select your pseudo elements
10:32 - when you use that so we want to come in
10:33 - here and just say box sizing border box
10:36 - if you don't already know this reset
10:39 - this is one of the most common things
10:41 - you'll see on any website these days it
10:42 - just makes calculating the widths and
10:44 - heights of things much much easier
10:46 - another one i'm going to do is reset
10:48 - margins reset margins
10:50 - and
10:51 - the one that you usually always see is
10:53 - the body but i'm also going to include
10:55 - all of my h2 my h3 which you could go
10:58 - down to h6 we won't have an h6 on this
11:01 - project i'm not even sure if we'll have
11:02 - an h5 to be honest but i'm going to
11:04 - include it just in case
11:05 - i'm also going to do my picture
11:07 - my picture my paragraphs as well as we
11:10 - will have
11:11 - picture elements which so we'll just
11:13 - throw all of these in there
11:14 - and we're just going to say that they
11:16 - all have a margin of zero and this is
11:19 - really handy we're actually going to be
11:20 - using different ways to reintroduce
11:22 - spacing and one of the most frustrating
11:24 - things with css is collapsing margins
11:26 - when everything has a margin top and
11:28 - bottom of it so we're gonna see it
11:29 - simple ways that we can sort of
11:30 - reintroduce spacing without having to
11:32 - worry about things like collapsing
11:33 - margins um and there's a few other
11:35 - things that i'm gonna bring in here in a
11:37 - second but i want you to try and think
11:39 - of a few things that you might reset or
11:41 - common resets that you do so throw them
11:43 - in here create a bit of a reset yourself
11:45 - you can see sort of the types of things
11:46 - i'm trying to bring css to something
11:49 - that is a nice place to start from so
11:50 - see if you can think of anything that
11:52 - you've seen or things that you commonly
11:53 - use in projects and then we can compare
11:55 - that to what i end up doing in mine so
11:58 - yeah you can go at it and in a few
11:59 - seconds i'll finish this up on my end
12:02 - all right so i'm going to keep on going
12:04 - here and i'm actually going to take a
12:06 - second before i do that just to come up
12:07 - here and in a comment i'm going to put
12:09 - this which um is andy bell's modern css
12:12 - reset and this is something that i use a
12:15 - variation of in all the projects so this
12:17 - is actually a variation of that um that
12:19 - i'll be using i won't use everything he
12:21 - has but this is a really nice starting
12:23 - point for resets if ever you just need
12:25 - something to copy and paste into your
12:26 - projects uh quickly you can't go wrong
12:28 - with this one there are other ones that
12:30 - you could use like just the the hard
12:32 - reset where we just strip everything
12:34 - down by eric meyer there's also things
12:36 - like normalize and sanitize as well
12:39 - those are also great places to work from
12:40 - but i sort of want to take advantage to
12:42 - explain a few of the things that i'm
12:44 - doing in here and there's not too much
12:46 - that comes into this so i think it's a
12:47 - few important things to address when
12:48 - we're starting to write our css and so
12:51 - now we can jump in and let's just say
12:52 - set up the body
12:54 - and i'm only going to do two things here
12:56 - i'm going to say that we want to do a
12:58 - line height and on most projects i do
13:01 - it's either a 1.5 or a 1.6 because the
13:04 - default for browsers is 1.4 which tends
13:06 - to be very very small so i'm going to go
13:09 - with the 1.5 and we can always adjust it
13:11 - from there and we're just going to do
13:13 - that as our quick reset for now and i'm
13:15 - also going to set a min height here of
13:17 - 100 vh and that just sets the stage to
13:20 - prevent any short pages from being an
13:22 - issue and especially in the designs that
13:24 - we're building for this project a lot of
13:26 - them there's no scrolling that's
13:27 - happening so this just sets the stage
13:29 - and makes life a little bit easier on
13:31 - that another one that we're going to
13:32 - want is make images easier to work with
13:36 - and if you don't already know images
13:38 - sometimes there's a few defaults on
13:40 - images and because we are using the
13:41 - picture element as well we'll select
13:43 - both of those and we're going to say a
13:44 - max width of 100 which just helps us
13:47 - make them nice and easy to work with as
13:49 - well as a display of block
13:51 - so this just helps us deal with the
13:53 - little
13:54 - spacing sometimes issues that you can
13:55 - get on images from time to time and the
13:58 - max width 100 here is a nice step to be
14:00 - taking and it just ensures that the
14:03 - images will shrink as the viewport gets
14:04 - narrower or the space they have to live
14:06 - in gets narrower we also want to come in
14:09 - and just you know make make forms make
14:12 - forms easier to work with
14:14 - and that's just because any or form
14:16 - element i guess um forum
14:19 - elements i should write because a lot of
14:21 - these and we're not we're going to be
14:22 - using buttons but it's just you know
14:23 - this is forward thinking if ever other
14:26 - stuff gets added so
14:28 - and select destroy font and do inherit
14:32 - and the nice thing with doing this uh
14:34 - because we will be using buttons on here
14:36 - by default buttons and all these form
14:38 - elements don't inherit the font
14:40 - properties which is a nightmare because
14:42 - font properties are inherited everywhere
14:43 - else so that just simplifies our life a
14:45 - little bit and this last one is a remove
14:49 - animations for people who've turned them
14:53 - off and this one i have copied so i'm
14:55 - going to paste it in
14:56 - and this is using the preferred reduced
14:58 - motion media query which means if
15:00 - somebody's taking the time to turn off
15:02 - animations within either their browser
15:03 - settings or at the os level that this is
15:06 - going to disable animations and
15:07 - transitions for them and this is a
15:09 - really important thing that we can do to
15:11 - deal with accessibility because there
15:13 - are a lot of people out there who motion
15:15 - causes problems and that motion could be
15:17 - parallax scrolling it could be constant
15:19 - movement on things as you're scrolling
15:22 - the scroll linked animations all these
15:23 - different things for a subset of the
15:25 - population
15:26 - it can make them nauseous it's going to
15:27 - make them leave your site it is an
15:29 - unpleasant experience for them it can
15:30 - cause nausea and it's just something
15:32 - that they don't want to have to deal
15:33 - with they've taken the time to turn it
15:35 - off in their browser or at the os level
15:38 - and we should respect that and we can do
15:40 - that really easily with this media query
15:42 - here
15:43 - there is also the option of a no
15:45 - preference here which we're not going to
15:46 - use because this means they haven't
15:47 - disabled it
15:48 - but that is a way that you can add
15:50 - animations in only if somebody is
15:52 - allowing them so there's the two
15:53 - different ways that you can work but
15:54 - just as a really quick solution here
15:56 - we're going to be throwing that in right
15:58 - there and that is it for my reset and
16:00 - everything we're going to be using as a
16:02 - hard reset there are other things that
16:03 - we often need resets for that i haven't
16:05 - included in here but we'll either be
16:08 - overwriting those ourselves with our own
16:09 - css or it's things that we don't
16:11 - actually need for this project so with
16:13 - that done in the next video we're going
16:14 - to start writing a few utility classes
16:18 - all right time to write some utility
16:20 - classes and in case you're not familiar
16:21 - with the term uh utility classes are
16:23 - something to do one thing and they do
16:25 - that one thing very well that means that
16:28 - often those only have one declaration
16:29 - and by declaration i just mean like it'd
16:31 - be color red so i'm declaring it's the
16:33 - property value pair is a declaration but
16:36 - sometimes they can have multiple when we
16:38 - need to as long as it's still just doing
16:40 - that one job and doing it really well
16:41 - we'll see an example of that in this
16:43 - video and this allows things to be much
16:45 - more modular and allow us to write a lot
16:47 - less code in the long run
16:49 - you might already be familiar with them
16:50 - if you know of something like tailwind
16:52 - we're not going all out and creating an
16:54 - entire library of utility classes for
16:56 - this finding a nice balance between
16:57 - utility classes and more component based
16:59 - classes is a really good way to work and
17:01 - we'll be exploring that more as we go
17:03 - through this but having a nice set of
17:05 - utility classes to start with can be
17:07 - very very useful so let's dive in and
17:10 - actually start setting up these and the
17:12 - first thing i'm going to do is actually
17:13 - go all the way to the top and copy the
17:14 - reset that i have here so i can bring
17:16 - this all the way down and make a new
17:18 - section of my css which is going to be
17:20 - my utility classes
17:22 - and now we can start working and so the
17:24 - first thing to do is create a flex
17:26 - utility class and we're going to do a
17:28 - display of flex on there and as you can
17:29 - guess that's that's one of those ones
17:31 - that i mentioned it's one declaration it
17:33 - does one thing it does it very well and
17:35 - we're also going to come in with a grid
17:37 - one and that one will set up a display
17:40 - of grid
17:41 - and this is one place though where we
17:43 - can actually take things a little bit of
17:45 - a step further
17:46 - and it's an interesting way where we can
17:47 - get utility classes to work with
17:49 - components and it's to take advantage of
17:51 - custom properties a little bit
17:53 - and if you're not familiar with this way
17:55 - of working with custom properties it is
17:57 - something i'm going to explain much more
17:59 - because we're going to be using this
18:00 - quite a lot through this
18:02 - and that is i'm going to come here and
18:04 - write gap and actually we can do this on
18:05 - both of them so i'm just going to hold
18:07 - down alt on my keyboard and select both
18:09 - sections right there so just by clicking
18:10 - and alt clicking in multiple places if
18:13 - you're on a mac that might be option or
18:14 - it might be alt i'm not sure because i'm
18:16 - on windows so i apologize for that and
18:18 - flex now has gap support this is a
18:21 - modern css approach which is really nice
18:24 - safari now has support for it which was
18:25 - the last major browser that we were
18:27 - waiting on for this and so i'm going to
18:30 - do a gap and you could do like a default
18:32 - of 1m but i don't want to do that what
18:34 - i'm going to do is a variable of gap we
18:36 - don't have a gap custom property and
18:38 - this is something again that is going to
18:40 - come back a little bit later and i'm
18:42 - going to explain more of how it works
18:43 - and i'm going to set a default of one
18:45 - rem for that it's going to allow us to
18:47 - use this custom property but really
18:49 - easily tweak it when we're setting up
18:51 - our different utilities like our
18:52 - navigation or a few of the other things
18:54 - as well where we need to use flex and
18:57 - grid and there's a few other things we
18:59 - could do with these um it is common to
19:01 - see things like fl align items justify
19:03 - items justify content and those types of
19:07 - other things set as utility classes and
19:10 - for this layout i don't personally see
19:11 - the need for it but if it is something
19:13 - where you see that being something that
19:15 - could be useful you could go ahead in
19:16 - your own version and add utility classes
19:18 - for some of those i'm only going to make
19:20 - two more generic utility classes in this
19:22 - lesson and then we're going to be going
19:24 - into ones that are more specific before
19:26 - now for these generic ones i only have
19:27 - two more and the first one is going to
19:29 - be a container and i'm sure you're
19:30 - familiar with either a container or a
19:32 - wrapper and if you are i want you to
19:34 - write your own and then i'm going to
19:36 - show you my own version of it and i want
19:37 - you to see if it's actually the same as
19:39 - what i would do don't just think it in
19:41 - your head take the time to write it out
19:42 - think of all the different properties
19:43 - you might need on something like this
19:45 - because this is one of those utility
19:47 - classes where you definitely need more
19:48 - than one declaration to really make it
19:50 - worthwhile as far as what width to use
19:53 - don't worry too much about the maximum
19:55 - width on it
19:56 - just as long as you have a value in
19:57 - there and then i'll show you my own
19:59 - solution in a few seconds
20:02 - all right so the very first thing i'm
20:04 - going to do is i'm going to write
20:05 - padding and very often you'll see
20:06 - something like padding 2m0 and i'll show
20:09 - another solution here that we could also
20:10 - use for this
20:11 - which means no padding on the top and
20:13 - then 2 on the left and the right which
20:14 - just prevents things from like touching
20:16 - the side of the page which can obviously
20:17 - be very useful
20:19 - another way that we can do this with
20:21 - more modern css is actually to use
20:23 - padding inline and then come in with qm
20:26 - scrimba is underlining this right now
20:28 - because this is a new css property it's
20:30 - called a logical property and what it's
20:32 - doing is looking at the inline axis of
20:34 - my container so it's gonna be the left
20:36 - and the right side and not the top and
20:38 - the bottom and even though scrimba is
20:40 - sort of complaining about this as well
20:41 - as gap here don't worry it's going to
20:43 - work even in the scrambler previewer
20:45 - that we're going to be using and it's
20:46 - also something that's supported in all
20:47 - the major browsers now so browser
20:49 - support as long as you're only worrying
20:50 - about newer browsers there's no issues
20:52 - with it at all and i'm going to come in
20:54 - and write a max width i said not to
20:56 - worry we're going to start with 80 ram
20:57 - and maybe we have to modify that and
20:59 - that could be somewhere where you
21:00 - actually use a custom property for this
21:02 - instead but we're going to stick with a
21:04 - set number
21:05 - just because i want to be consistent
21:06 - between all of my pages and the last
21:08 - thing i need is my margin auto to hold
21:10 - the content in the middle of the page i
21:12 - only need the margin on the left and the
21:14 - right side so can you guess and maybe
21:16 - write the line of code now similar to
21:17 - our padding that would work with our
21:19 - margin
21:20 - and so hopefully you thought of or wrote
21:22 - margin in line of auto which once again
21:25 - is going to be my margin left and my
21:27 - margin right and it just doesn't set any
21:29 - value to the top and the bottom even
21:31 - though you generally don't run into
21:32 - conflicts with these this could
21:33 - technically prevent conflicts and the
21:36 - last thing i'm going to include in my
21:37 - reset for now is an sr only class which
21:40 - are super super useful i'm going to
21:42 - paste it in because there's quite a bit
21:43 - in here
21:44 - this is a really common
21:46 - utility that you're going to see which
21:48 - is screen reader only and what that
21:50 - means is it's only for assistive
21:52 - technologies that are reading the page
21:54 - to somebody if they're visiting the page
21:56 - and you know they're visually impaired
21:57 - and let's say we have content on a page
22:00 - that might be say a button that doesn't
22:01 - have any text in it but visually it's
22:04 - very clear what that button does so
22:05 - somebody who is a sighted user can see
22:07 - it and know if i click this this is
22:08 - what's going to happen but if it's a
22:10 - screen reader who's reading through the
22:12 - content on a page it's just going to
22:13 - announce that there's a button there and
22:15 - the user is going to have no idea what
22:16 - that button does if there's no text in
22:18 - it so we can use this to visually hide
22:20 - content for sighted users but then keep
22:23 - that content in the page as something
22:24 - that's actually there so if a screen
22:26 - reader comes across it it can give that
22:28 - extra context to the users that are
22:30 - using those assistive technologies it's
22:32 - a very easy thing to do and we're going
22:33 - to be using it in several different
22:34 - places throughout this project
22:39 - so in the next lesson we're going to
22:40 - dive in and start creating our own
22:42 - utilities but first before that i want
22:43 - you to get a little bit of practice
22:45 - using these ones that we've created
22:46 - right here so i'm going to jump over to
22:48 - the html file and this is just sort of a
22:50 - standalone we'll delete everything
22:51 - that's in here once we're done uh but
22:53 - you can see i've created a few
22:54 - challenges for you and i want you to
22:56 - hold the content in the middle of the
22:58 - page wrap it either in a flex or grid we
23:00 - have our utility classes for that try
23:03 - changing the gap variable without
23:04 - modifying the original or gml utility
23:08 - class and to use the sr only class on a
23:11 - div to see what happens and by this one
23:13 - what i mean is find a way to modify this
23:16 - variable here
23:18 - without actually coming onto here and
23:20 - changing it see if you can find a
23:22 - different place you can change it and to
23:24 - get a different gap than the default one
23:26 - rem that's on there and you might be
23:28 - saying what content so i'm going to come
23:29 - and give you some really quickly
23:31 - so there's the content we're going to be
23:32 - working with really nothing too fancy
23:34 - but i will come down into the css and
23:36 - just give them a little bit of style and
23:38 - again we won't have any of these this
23:39 - i'll make sure all of this is cleared
23:41 - out before the next lesson but just a
23:42 - little bit of practice and this will
23:43 - help so i'm just going to give the dot
23:45 - box a background color of light blue so
23:48 - we can actually see something and i'll
23:49 - give them a padding of three rem just so
23:52 - we have something that we can work with
23:54 - and i'm going to click run over here
23:55 - just so we can see that we have some
23:57 - boxes that are coming in so why don't
23:59 - you go ahead and try following each one
24:01 - of these things here if you get stuck on
24:03 - any of them or you're not sure don't
24:04 - worry i'm going to give my own solution
24:06 - to all of this in just a second but i'd
24:08 - like you to try it out first
24:11 - all right so i hope that went well and
24:12 - some of these might have been easier
24:13 - than other international class container
24:15 - and we can just wrap all of this here
24:17 - and close
24:19 - div over here and let's just fix my
24:21 - quotation mark
24:23 - and by doing that and then we'll hit tab
24:25 - we should see now that my content is
24:27 - held in the middle of the page when
24:28 - we're at larger screen sizes and then as
24:31 - we go to these smaller sizes it's
24:32 - shrinking but we have that two rem gap
24:34 - on the side so our content is never
24:36 - touching the edge and 80 is a little bit
24:39 - big for scrimba so just to show you if
24:41 - you did run into this and you couldn't
24:42 - see it if you are using the scrimba
24:44 - editor i will drop this down to 60.
24:47 - just so we can see that we do hit a
24:48 - point where we get to that maximum size
24:51 - and then it holds it at that size right
24:53 - there so for this lesson i'll keep this
24:55 - at 60 but when i get back to the next
24:57 - one i'm gonna pump that back up to 80.
25:00 - the next thing that i wanted to do was
25:02 - to wrap the content in either a flex or
25:04 - the grid class so if you created a new
25:07 - div to put all of this in that's
25:09 - perfectly fine or because it is a
25:10 - utility class we could put it here it
25:12 - really depends on circumstances it's not
25:14 - too often that i end up doing something
25:16 - like this but it would work
25:17 - we need to have them set up in the flex
25:19 - or if i switch it over to grid we can
25:21 - see that it will be in a grid and the
25:23 - grid the default for it doesn't actually
25:25 - make columns or anything so we just have
25:27 - these guys stacking on top of each other
25:28 - but we can see that the gap property is
25:31 - working and again if we switch that back
25:33 - over to flex we can also see that the
25:35 - gap property is working there and it's
25:37 - creating these spaces in between them
25:39 - the next thing we want to do is try and
25:40 - change that gap variable without
25:42 - modifying the original utility class and
25:45 - there's two different approaches you can
25:46 - take to this one of them which is
25:48 - popular is actually using inline styles
25:50 - and within an inline style we can just
25:52 - say gap and change this to say five ram
25:54 - which would make it quite a lot bigger
25:56 - and now we get a bigger gap between them
25:58 - and this will also work if we had that
26:00 - as a grid and then you can see the
26:03 - spacing has increased vertically
26:05 - this is a popular one and the nice thing
26:07 - with this is it's easy just to create
26:08 - like a one-off modification
26:10 - of that custom property that you created
26:12 - so if you had the same type of thing
26:14 - being used in multiple places and this
26:16 - is just one off you don't really want to
26:18 - create a different class for it
26:20 - you can have that set up and then we can
26:22 - have our smaller gaps that are appearing
26:23 - over here these two are stuck together
26:25 - because it's there's no gap between this
26:28 - big div and this div over here um but
26:30 - yeah it's just a quick way to make a
26:32 - one-off style it's become actually quite
26:34 - popular and you'll see it used a lot
26:36 - some people don't like the idea of
26:38 - in-line styling things just because then
26:40 - you know maybe you can't find what's
26:41 - actually controlling it or why those
26:43 - gaps are bigger than they were uh before
26:46 - so the other way that you can do it and
26:48 - let's just pretend instead of in this
26:49 - situation we're working on this little
26:51 - very simple grid but let's just say that
26:52 - this was actually a like a different
26:55 - component so we had a container a grid
26:58 - and then say this was like my call to
26:59 - action call to action
27:02 - and in that case what you could do is in
27:04 - your css you're writing all of your
27:06 - styles for your call to action so say
27:08 - you give it a background that's ping and
27:11 - the padding on it is to rem and it has a
27:14 - border radius
27:16 - of one ram and don't forget your
27:18 - semicolons and of course call to action
27:21 - i actually wrote it out uh so there we
27:23 - go we can see it's actually coming in
27:24 - and it's working
27:26 - so in a situation like this where you
27:28 - have something like that what you could
27:30 - do is come on here and actually say gap
27:33 - and change the property here and i can
27:34 - make it five rem and then it's going to
27:37 - actually modify it within that class so
27:40 - two different ways that we can modify it
27:42 - we'll be taking advantage of the inline
27:44 - style way of doing it especially within
27:46 - our design system since that's a lot
27:48 - more one-off things and generally
27:50 - speaking i like working this way but
27:52 - both of them work perfectly well and are
27:54 - valid ways to work so just a fun cool
27:56 - way we can do that and one last thing
27:58 - before i let you go is i did want you to
28:00 - try and use the sr only class so let's
28:02 - get rid of our call to action here
28:03 - because that pink is not working and
28:05 - then i'm going to come on this a box and
28:08 - say sr only and if i hit save it is
28:11 - visually gone it's completely pulled out
28:13 - of the flow we don't see it anymore but
28:15 - if you were to look in the dom it would
28:16 - still be there and a screen reader would
28:18 - still be able to access it so it's not
28:20 - like a display none a display nun takes
28:22 - it out of the dom that is no longer part
28:24 - of your page this sr only class we've
28:26 - created leaves it in the dom it just
28:28 - fully visually hides it so there we go a
28:31 - quick little rundown on these ones we've
28:33 - created now we can jump on in to
28:35 - creating our colors and if you want to
28:36 - play around with things a little bit
28:38 - especially maybe this way of
28:39 - manipulating things just make sure that
28:41 - you're used to it if it's something new
28:42 - that you haven't seen before do that
28:44 - first play around with it get used to it
28:46 - and then i'll see you in the next lesson
28:48 - when you're ready
28:50 - all right so it's time to start working
28:52 - on the color section of our design
28:54 - system and this is what we're going to
28:56 - be setting up right here and just before
28:58 - we dive into it you'll notice that we
28:59 - have the values in hex as well as rgb
29:02 - and hsl and i'm going to recommend
29:05 - either that use rgb in hsl and i'm
29:07 - actually going to set things up in a
29:08 - very particular way when i do it and
29:10 - i'll explain why as as i go through it
29:12 - all
29:13 - but there the advantage of rgb and hsl
29:15 - values with hsl actually it's the
29:17 - easiest one to make modifications to but
29:19 - in this case we don't need to because we
29:21 - have all the colors that are being given
29:22 - to us but there is a trick in using
29:25 - custom properties with hsl or rgb that
29:27 - allows us really easy ways of tweaking
29:29 - the alpha value when needed which we're
29:31 - going to be using quite a bit in this
29:32 - project with how i'm going to be
29:34 - approaching it
29:35 - and so i'm going to leave the this slide
29:37 - up just because we're going to actually
29:39 - move away from having this jpeg here and
29:41 - what i would recommend that you do is
29:44 - actually go to the original design files
29:45 - at this point and instead of referencing
29:48 - this because instead of looking at this
29:50 - file i've created this design
29:51 - system.html which is where we're going
29:53 - to be working from so we have a nice
29:54 - blank page to start with
29:57 - and before we even get started with
29:59 - anything we do need a little bit of
30:01 - content in here which would help us out
30:02 - so i'm going to start things off by
30:04 - coming in and giving us that give class
30:05 - of container to hold everything that we
30:07 - need and i'm going to close my div
30:10 - and i'm not going to worry so much about
30:11 - the title let's just throw an h1 here at
30:13 - the top of design system
30:16 - i'm not going to worry about i know it
30:17 - has the logo and the design system on
30:20 - the right side in the actual design
30:21 - system but i'm just going to throw this
30:22 - here for now because the one i'm really
30:24 - worried about is our section which we'll
30:26 - call colors
30:28 - and i'm just going to use an id on here
30:30 - not that we really need it but you could
30:31 - include links somewhere if you want to
30:33 - easily get through between these
30:34 - different sections
30:35 - and so we can close our section there
30:37 - usually i always recommend writing the
30:39 - html for something first but in this
30:41 - case i'm actually going to recommend
30:43 - that we come in and do our css first and
30:45 - if you remember i said that i like
30:47 - having hsl or rgb
30:49 - so i would really recommend that and i
30:51 - am going to set everything up all the
30:52 - way at the top here
30:54 - we're going to create this custom
30:55 - properties section at the top here and
30:57 - if you're comfortable with custom
30:58 - properties what i want you to do is
31:00 - create the custom properties we need for
31:03 - the three colors we're going to be using
31:04 - and again choose either rgb or hsl for
31:06 - this because i do want to show you a
31:08 - trick that we'll be doing if you've
31:09 - never used custom properties before then
31:11 - you can wait for my solution in just a
31:13 - couple of seconds
31:16 - all right we only have three colors and
31:18 - when i do custom properties i do like
31:19 - prefixing if it's a color with color and
31:21 - if it's a font size with fs and other
31:23 - things and we'll see why as i work
31:24 - through this project
31:25 - um in this case we only have three
31:27 - colors and it sort of breaks from how i
31:29 - normally like to name things so i'm
31:31 - actually going to name them
31:32 - and then color white and
31:35 - it's really different from how i
31:36 - normally do things but we really only
31:38 - have three colors that we need to work
31:39 - with and then it's varying like alpha
31:41 - values on them
31:43 - and this is where it's very common to
31:44 - see something like hsl and then you come
31:46 - in with the numbers and this is again
31:48 - i'm looking at modern css so we're going
31:49 - to do it the modern way 35
31:52 - where you don't need commas anymore and
31:54 - 7
31:56 - um so we can write that without commas
31:57 - it's very it's perfectly valid with the
31:59 - new color syntax and again it is
32:01 - supported in all modern browsers and the
32:03 - advantage with writing it like this is
32:05 - you can come in and do a slash and like
32:07 - 0.5 and that would be your alpha value
32:09 - but
32:10 - the issue is if we store it like this in
32:12 - a custom property we lose the ability to
32:15 - manipulate that alpha value very easily
32:18 - and there are ways you could do it with
32:20 - another custom property and sort of play
32:22 - around with things and get clever with
32:23 - it but what i actually like doing is
32:25 - storing this value as my custom property
32:27 - instead which might look a little bit
32:29 - weird but i'll explain why in a second
32:31 - but first i'm just going to fill out
32:32 - these two really quickly
32:34 - all right so we have those there and now
32:36 - to explain how i'm going to use them
32:37 - when they're just values like that let's
32:39 - go down and create those custom property
32:41 - colors so i'm going to come here and
32:42 - we'll create a colors section
32:45 - just like that and i'm calling it a
32:47 - color section so here's our general
32:48 - classes and then underneath that we can
32:50 - have our colors which are all utility
32:52 - classes
32:53 - and you might also be wondering at this
32:55 - point like why would i make utility
32:56 - classes as well as custom properties and
32:59 - i'm going to explain as we go through
33:00 - the course why i would do that so let's
33:02 - start with a bg dark and i'm going to
33:04 - say that that means the background color
33:08 - is the value that i wanted but remember
33:10 - i'm using the hsl values so i'm actually
33:12 - going to write hsl like this and then
33:14 - inside of there i'm going to write my
33:16 - variable color dark
33:18 - and
33:19 - we can do that and what that means is
33:22 - and this will enable us to use it so
33:24 - just to show you that working i'm going
33:25 - to come over to my design system on the
33:27 - body here i'm going to give that a class
33:29 - is equal to bg dark i'm going to hit
33:31 - save and the background has changed over
33:34 - to that color
33:35 - and so what i'm going to do is challenge
33:37 - you now to create
33:39 - background class for the three different
33:40 - colors we have and another class that
33:43 - will set up the text color for the three
33:46 - different colors that we have as well
33:49 - all right so what i'm going to do is
33:51 - just copy this and paste it and paste it
33:53 - so we can work a little faster and you
33:54 - know what i'm actually going to paste it
33:56 - again here because i'm going to be doing
33:58 - my bg dark and what i'm going to do is
34:00 - actually change all three of these so
34:02 - again i'm holding alt down and i'm going
34:03 - to call these text dark what i actually
34:05 - like doing on something like this i'm
34:07 - going to select both of these and it's a
34:09 - little weird because i did do
34:10 - a color of light and here i'm going to
34:12 - call it color accent just because i'm
34:14 - funny that way and how i like to name
34:16 - things but
34:17 - um that's what i'm going to do and then
34:18 - this one we will do a color white and
34:20 - i'm just going to update these so they
34:21 - match everything that we have
34:23 - i almost left this here using background
34:25 - colors on all these and that would have
34:26 - been a little silly of me and while we
34:28 - have enough to get started in creating
34:30 - what we have on the screen right now
34:32 - before we do that i have a little bit of
34:34 - a challenge for you and we'll see that
34:35 - challenge in the next lesson
34:40 - so before we start building this out and
34:42 - give you a little bit of practice i want
34:43 - to give you a little bit of a challenge
34:44 - first that's also going to explore the
34:47 - alpha value thing that i was talking
34:48 - about with our custom properties so
34:51 - the first thing i want you to do is to
34:52 - give this first div here a light blue
34:55 - background and a dark text color this
34:57 - second one here we're going to give it a
34:58 - white background and we're going to give
35:00 - it a dark text color and this is only
35:02 - using the utility classes that we've
35:03 - created so far and this third one is
35:06 - going to be a little bit different
35:07 - in that we can't necessarily use one of
35:09 - our utility classes for it but i want
35:11 - you to give that third div a light blue
35:13 - background but with an alpha value of 20
35:16 - and with a white text in there and so i
35:19 - already gave you a little bit of a hint
35:20 - for that third one and so i'm gonna
35:22 - recommend you dive in and see what you
35:23 - can do with it and if you haven't played
35:24 - with custom properties too much this
35:26 - last one might be a little bit tricky
35:27 - but see what you can do with it anyway
35:29 - and if you get stuck i'm going to be
35:30 - giving my solution here in just a few
35:32 - seconds
35:35 - all right so i'm going to come on this
35:36 - first guy we're going to give this one a
35:38 - class and we want to give it a class
35:40 - light blue background i call that bg
35:41 - accent so we can use that and then the
35:43 - dark text color we can just do a text
35:46 - dark and let's save and go take a look
35:48 - and we can see it's working right there
35:50 - then we can jump onto this next one
35:52 - right here and i'll give this one a bg
35:55 - of white and my text dark
35:58 - and we can see that one is also working
36:00 - fantastic and we have one more to do and
36:03 - this is the tricky one
36:04 - and so if you tried this
36:06 - if we use the i'll do the white text so
36:09 - text uh
36:10 - white and we can see that that text
36:12 - color has indeed changed but for the
36:15 - background color i can't use the bg
36:17 - white on this one for this one i will
36:18 - have to create my own class for it and
36:20 - so i'm just going to write example for
36:22 - now um and this is going to come in
36:24 - we're going to be using it for actual
36:26 - components and you'll see how this can
36:27 - actually really play into things really
36:29 - really well as we go through and build
36:31 - out actual components with this so maybe
36:34 - even example component might be a better
36:35 - name component and this can work whether
36:38 - it's a text color or whether it's a
36:40 - background color and it's going to be
36:42 - something that we use quite a lot
36:43 - actually through this project so i want
36:45 - to make sure you understand how it works
36:47 - so we're going to jump over here to my
36:48 - css and i'm going to do
36:50 - example component and on that example
36:53 - component we need to do something so i'm
36:55 - going to say that we have a background
36:57 - color that makes sense i think and
36:59 - obviously we have our hsl and i want it
37:00 - to be the light color and
37:02 - that's the the light blue and if i just
37:04 - do that right now let's hit save and go
37:06 - take a look and it has the regular light
37:08 - blue background on there and i mentioned
37:10 - that we can change the opacity on it so
37:12 - if you got stuck before and now you
37:14 - might have a little memory of how to do
37:16 - it why don't you try and do it and if
37:17 - not
37:18 - or if you don't remember i'll show you
37:19 - the solution in just a second
37:22 - and so before i show you the solution
37:24 - let's just go back up and look at what's
37:25 - happening here and to really grasp what
37:28 - we're doing so this is the value that
37:30 - i'm grabbing right there and i'm going
37:31 - to come down
37:32 - and so writing this is the same thing as
37:35 - writing
37:37 - that just like that these are doing the
37:38 - exact same thing i'm just going to
37:40 - change the number here to 150 just so we
37:42 - can see that it does change
37:44 - so we go look we can see that it's now
37:45 - that green color because i changed my
37:47 - degrees here and i mentioned that one
37:50 - thing we can do with hsl values is we
37:52 - can do a forward slash and then change
37:54 - the opacity of it
37:55 - so i can go take a look and now we can
37:57 - see we have the lighter color that's
37:59 - come through it's a lower opacity
38:01 - because we can see the blue color is now
38:02 - starting to come through i can drop that
38:04 - down to 0.1 and we can see that it's
38:06 - almost gone to the same color because
38:08 - it's so faded out so remember when i do
38:10 - the var color light what that's doing is
38:13 - it's just inputting these three values
38:15 - right here so it's the exact same thing
38:18 - as taking this deleting that and putting
38:19 - that in there
38:21 - so that means we could leave this here
38:23 - and delete this right here
38:24 - and i could leave this exactly like that
38:26 - but then i could do a forward slash and
38:28 - then choose an alpha value so dot 0.2
38:32 - because we wanted a 20
38:33 - alpha value and we can see that it's
38:36 - working just like that so if you want to
38:38 - play around with this experiment with it
38:39 - a little bit just to make sure that
38:40 - you're really understanding how it works
38:42 - go ahead and do that and then when
38:44 - you're ready i'll see you in the next
38:45 - lesson
38:50 - so we know how the utility classes are
38:52 - working and we're starting to get into
38:54 - that flow of things so what i'm actually
38:56 - going to do here is i'm going to create
38:58 - a div
38:59 - and on this div and we're going to do a
39:01 - closed div right here and i'm going to
39:03 - use this div to make one of these guys
39:07 - right here and one thing that is
39:08 - important with this is
39:10 - there's a few styles in here that are to
39:13 - if we want to match what this actually
39:14 - looks like that are important for this
39:17 - one place that would not be used in our
39:19 - actual page like these little color
39:21 - samples with the border that is on them
39:23 - because those borders don't exist
39:25 - there's extra padding on here and stuff
39:26 - like that so what i'm going to do is i'm
39:29 - going to start by coming in here with a
39:30 - div and i am going to give this a style
39:33 - so it's an inline style for my style i'm
39:35 - going to give it some padding of three
39:37 - ram on the top and one ram on both sides
39:39 - and one ram on the bottom and next up
39:42 - i'm also going to give this a border of
39:44 - one pixel solid and i'll put white even
39:46 - though i know uh or i'm pretty sure it's
39:48 - not actually white and actually let's
39:50 - close that div and let's go see what
39:52 - that looks like so i'll hit save and you
39:54 - can see a big box has come in and it's
39:56 - stretching all the way across the page
39:57 - which is perfectly fine
39:59 - and then here i would have two
40:01 - paragraphs so paragraph close paragraph
40:04 - and we need another one underneath that
40:07 - and i'll just bring the content in here
40:08 - really quickly so that content is all in
40:11 - place now but obviously we can't see
40:13 - anything that's on there and we need to
40:16 - make this come to life a little bit so
40:18 - what i would challenge you to do now is
40:19 - actually see what you can get done on
40:21 - this without seeing anything more for me
40:22 - but i will show you my solution to this
40:24 - one in a few seconds but hit pause try
40:27 - and get everything just the colors
40:28 - matching we have background color we
40:30 - have text colors on these and if you
40:32 - have the time you can also go through
40:33 - and do these other ones as well just
40:35 - don't worry about the numbered title
40:36 - here because i have a specific lesson on
40:38 - that as we're going to take a little bit
40:39 - of a different approach to it but i do
40:41 - think you can get this one done pretty
40:43 - easily so i'm going to leave this one
40:44 - for you and then in a few seconds i'll
40:46 - show you my solution
40:49 - all right so for my solution if you
40:50 - didn't take this approach is perfectly
40:51 - fine but i'm actually going to go up on
40:52 - my body and put a text
40:54 - white on there just so we can actually
40:56 - see our text everywhere which makes life
40:58 - a little bit easier and whenever i can
41:00 - apply something on the body and let that
41:02 - cascade down i'm always going to take
41:04 - advantage of that
41:05 - and so the next thing i want to do is to
41:07 - go on this div right here and we can
41:10 - give this a class and we don't need to
41:12 - give it the bg dark because we have abg
41:14 - dark on the body obviously so we don't
41:16 - see that difference but i'll throw it on
41:18 - there anyway and a text white so if i
41:20 - hit save i can see it's working and the
41:22 - text has changed and if i took off my
41:24 - text dark and we hit save you can see
41:27 - it's still working and i can still see
41:29 - that there
41:30 - so that's the main reason i just want to
41:32 - show if somebody's looking at my design
41:34 - system that they'll see those two
41:35 - classes that are on there
41:37 - down here we can come on and we don't
41:39 - need the text of light but we do need to
41:41 - put a span here so on both of these we
41:43 - can add an opening span and we can come
41:46 - on both of these and do a close span
41:48 - just like that and if you weren't sure
41:51 - you got stuck there and now you know
41:52 - what to do well we just have to come in
41:54 - and add our class of text accent
41:57 - and then i can do the same thing on that
41:59 - one hit save and we can see that the
42:02 - different color has come on that and
42:04 - that is pretty much what we needed to do
42:06 - for this one but my next challenge would
42:08 - be i'll copy this for you
42:11 - and paste it so if you didn't already do
42:13 - all of them we do want to get all three
42:15 - of these guys done and there's an extra
42:17 - challenge of getting them to go next to
42:19 - one another and i'm not going to give
42:21 - you the solution to that not in this
42:23 - video and not in the next one either
42:24 - because in the next one we're going to
42:25 - get into the typography so try your best
42:28 - at solving this getting it all set up
42:30 - getting used to using the utility
42:31 - classes and if you can't get things to
42:33 - go next to each other or there's an
42:34 - issue with something else you can always
42:36 - look at my finished code which will be
42:38 - available to you in that next lesson so
42:41 - when you're ready i'll see you over
42:42 - there
42:45 - all right so time to dive into the
42:47 - typography and things are going to move
42:48 - pretty quickly here where we're going to
42:49 - build out this section here not worrying
42:52 - too much about the spacing but we can
42:53 - get all of this set up and looking
42:55 - pretty good
42:56 - and pretty quickly once we have our
42:58 - utility classes created but one thing i
43:01 - really want to make sure when we're
43:02 - doing this is remember utility classes
43:03 - do one thing and one thing really well
43:05 - so we want to make sure that we break
43:07 - things up so everything is doing just
43:09 - one job and here we can see i have a
43:12 - font family i have a font size and on
43:14 - some of the styles we also have
43:16 - character space which is your letter
43:17 - spacing
43:18 - and
43:19 - everything becomes more plug and play if
43:21 - we actually separate these into their
43:23 - own classes rather than having them act
43:25 - as one thing and especially the font
43:27 - family and the
43:29 - pixel value you're going to see like
43:30 - that repeats itself over multiple ones
43:33 - so it becomes very easy just to create
43:35 - utility classes that make all of this
43:37 - very plug and play this also allows us
43:39 - to write more semantic html and by
43:42 - semantic html i mean our headings can
43:43 - actually do the job that a heading is
43:45 - meant to do rather than the heading
43:47 - styling something if your h5 like this
43:49 - one is linked to a very specific style
43:52 - that could actually cause for on
43:53 - semantic html later on because you might
43:55 - be using an h5 somewhere you shouldn't
43:57 - be using it or maybe you're using an h1
43:59 - when you actually
44:01 - or maybe you're using an h2 on something
44:03 - that should be in h1 or you know there's
44:05 - a lot of different situations that come
44:06 - up like that so do not pay attention to
44:08 - the heading levels that are here we're
44:10 - going to break things up as much as we
44:11 - can and just like before we're going to
44:14 - start that up here
44:15 - in our custom properties and so i'm
44:17 - going to add colors here we don't really
44:18 - need it but we can add colors and then
44:20 - here i'm going to write fonts and what
44:22 - start with font sizes actually font
44:24 - sizes
44:25 - and there are a few important things one
44:27 - of them is i like doing fs as you might
44:29 - have guessed and setting things up with
44:31 - 400 being my base size and when i say
44:33 - base size what i mean is the body text
44:36 - size so this here it's not actually
44:38 - listed right here in this screenshot but
44:40 - it's actually size 18 and the font the
44:43 - font family for it's actually this
44:44 - barlow regular it's not a condensed
44:46 - version of it
44:47 - so that's sort of where i like starting
44:49 - my base and then as we go smaller i go
44:52 - like here is a 16 18 to 16 that would be
44:54 - my font size 300 my font size 200 so
44:57 - this is like font weights and the font
44:59 - weight system which goes the lighter you
45:01 - get the smaller the number and then the
45:03 - bolder you get the bigger the number so
45:05 - this would be my four my three my two
45:07 - and then my four then this is the next
45:09 - one up so five six seven eight nine and
45:12 - that works really well with the system i
45:13 - like because i really like going in with
45:15 - that type of idea and i've already
45:18 - have these ready and i don't think you
45:19 - want to watch me write them so i'm just
45:21 - going to plug them in and one thing
45:22 - you'll notice is i am using rems for
45:24 - these rather than using the pixel values
45:27 - that are given here and this is once
45:29 - again for accessibility reasons because
45:31 - if you were to use pixels it could
45:32 - potentially overwrite settings that the
45:34 - user has put into place to give
45:36 - themselves a bigger or potentially
45:37 - smaller default font size and if they've
45:40 - taken the time to do that we want to
45:41 - respect that they've played with their
45:43 - settings a little bit and if you use
45:44 - pixel values depending on how they've
45:46 - set things up zoom levels are different
45:48 - but if they've done other system
45:49 - settings or browser settings
45:51 - pixel values could potentially overwrite
45:53 - that and then their font sizes could be
45:55 - smaller than they want and then they
45:56 - leave your site so it's very easy to see
45:58 - whatever values you see on the slides
46:00 - and just divide by 16 to get the numbers
46:02 - that you have here and because we're
46:04 - using custom properties i feel no need
46:06 - to do that html
46:08 - 62.5 on the font size to reset things
46:11 - like a base 10 working from base 16 when
46:14 - you only have to worry about things once
46:15 - it doesn't make things that complicated
46:17 - because you're not remembering these
46:18 - strange values you're just remembering
46:20 - five six seven eight or nine hundred i'm
46:23 - also going to speed things up a little
46:24 - bit for you here by coming in and
46:26 - bringing in the font families as well
46:28 - just because again writing the custom
46:29 - properties here there's no you know i
46:31 - don't think you'd be learning a ton from
46:32 - it and we're going to be looking at how
46:34 - we can turn all of these into our
46:35 - utility classes and that's where the
46:37 - challenges are going to come so you can
46:39 - see here i've set up these three
46:41 - which is my
46:43 - font family serif which is my serif one
46:45 - my saw serif condensed barlow condensed
46:48 - and then my font family songs normal
46:50 - which is barlow's serif
46:53 - and all of this already i've also taken
46:55 - the time to go to google and get the
46:57 - links to everything that we need right
46:59 - here so the google fonts are linked in
47:02 - the design system they're not in their
47:03 - index but we're not there yet anyway
47:05 - and so we have everything that we need
47:07 - to get started and create some things
47:09 - and then start applying them in our page
47:12 - now you'll notice one thing i didn't do
47:14 - is turn the letter spacing ones into
47:16 - custom properties
47:17 - um this could be just if you think you
47:20 - would need them as a custom property by
47:22 - all means go ahead and set them as
47:23 - custom properties i think we can just
47:24 - set those as utility classes but just
47:26 - because i don't see those changing very
47:28 - much uh down the road i think they're
47:30 - very locked in values by the looks of it
47:32 - but if you prefer them as a custom
47:33 - property there's no issue with that
47:34 - whatsoever
47:35 - but having things like this that could
47:37 - potentially change
47:38 - as custom properties is always a good
47:40 - thing and you'll see what i mean shortly
47:41 - as we play with this site a little bit
47:44 - and instead of challenging you here to
47:45 - actually create all of these because
47:47 - once again we're going to have a whole
47:48 - bunch of them and they're just pretty
47:50 - much taking the custom properties i've
47:52 - done and switching them over i'm going
47:54 - to place them in here for you and then
47:55 - challenge you to actually use them so
47:58 - here's all of the
48:00 - utility classes for the typography that
48:02 - i think are going to be useful
48:03 - and so we have our different font
48:05 - families that we can control here we
48:07 - have our letter spacing ones that we can
48:09 - control here and so it's the biggest to
48:11 - the smallest then we have my uppercase
48:13 - which is something that's not actually
48:14 - listed but if we come and look a lot of
48:16 - these are uppercase but every now and
48:17 - then you might not want an upper case so
48:19 - i created an uppercase one just to make
48:21 - it easier to make changes because it
48:23 - sucks coming in and actually trying to
48:24 - like retype something in your html to
48:26 - get it to be uppercase so this is a very
48:28 - handy little utility class we have all
48:31 - the font sizes set here and i've also
48:32 - come in and changed the line height on
48:34 - these bigger font sizes just because uh
48:37 - the line height when the lines break
48:39 - gets really really ugly so i've taken
48:40 - the time to go and make that change
48:43 - right there and one thing we're going to
48:45 - do before actually starting to use these
48:47 - just to speed things up a little bit if
48:49 - you look through all the different pages
48:50 - that are supplied in the design there is
48:53 - one thing that we can do that's going to
48:54 - help a little bit and cut down on some
48:57 - extra stuff we're doing is when we set
48:58 - up our body here and so the first thing
49:00 - i'm going to do on here is set my font
49:02 - family and there are different ones we
49:05 - can do but the nice thing with this is i
49:06 - can do a dash dash and i know you can't
49:08 - see it on your screen so i'm going to
49:09 - get you to practice it or try this out
49:11 - in a second but as soon as i do that i
49:13 - see all of my custom properties and then
49:14 - i can put ff and it's only going to show
49:16 - me the ones i prefixed with that and in
49:18 - this case i'm going to choose the size
49:20 - normal just because that's the one that
49:23 - is on my body and that's you know my
49:25 - paragraphs and my regular body text so
49:27 - i'm going to put that on my body
49:28 - you could make a case on the site to put
49:30 - this as the condensed because you might
49:32 - actually have to use less utility
49:34 - classes along the way but i'm going to
49:35 - do it like this
49:37 - and then what i want you to do is try
49:39 - this out so we also have a font family
49:41 - another one we need is the font size and
49:43 - if you remember my font size is the 400
49:46 - is the default so what i want you to do
49:47 - is pause the video now and do the double
49:49 - hyphen and see the whole list that comes
49:51 - up here in scrimba and this will be the
49:52 - same in text editors like vs code do the
49:54 - double hyphen you get the full list do
49:56 - your prefix fs for font size and then
49:58 - you only see the font sizes and then you
50:00 - can just choose the one that you want
50:01 - from there so i'll give you a second to
50:03 - try that out and then we'll look at a
50:04 - couple of other little adjustments we
50:06 - can make before we start using all of
50:07 - this
50:09 - great so i hope you saw how nice that is
50:11 - so that we have my font size and we said
50:13 - we want the 400 on there so i can do
50:15 - that it auto populates it just by
50:17 - selecting it and we're starting to be
50:19 - off and running
50:21 - there are two other properties that i'm
50:23 - actually going to add to here and that
50:26 - is it would be kind of annoying if we
50:28 - had to always come in and add this on
50:30 - every single one of them and these
50:31 - utility classes work great but setting
50:34 - that every time on the body is a little
50:35 - bit annoying so i'm actually going to
50:36 - remove them we're going to come back
50:38 - into here and we're going to add them
50:41 - here so if you want to do that to get a
50:42 - little bit more practice with the double
50:44 - hyphen just seeing how it populates
50:46 - making sure you're comfortable with it
50:47 - you can do that right now and in one
50:49 - second i'll add my own in
50:51 - alright and you might have had a little
50:53 - gotcha there along the way and that
50:55 - would mean that you would have had to
50:57 - have remembered that we actually need to
50:58 - because of how i've set things up wrap
51:00 - things in the hsl because i did things a
51:03 - little bit differently and so here on my
51:05 - color instead of just doing the custom
51:07 - prop i'm going to do my hsl and then i'm
51:09 - going to choose my color light
51:11 - just like that and then on my background
51:14 - oh i don't want light i want color white
51:16 - actually
51:17 - and then
51:18 - on the background color
51:20 - we can come and do the same thing hsl
51:22 - and choose my color dark and there we go
51:26 - that should set things up nicely there
51:28 - we go we can already see it's come back
51:30 - and it's starting to work so that's
51:32 - fantastic all right and with that set up
51:34 - we can come over and i'm going to do one
51:35 - thing really quickly because we're going
51:36 - to see there's one more problem that
51:37 - we're actually going to run into and
51:39 - before we get into that next section i
51:41 - can start using some of those classes up
51:43 - here and on here and i just want to
51:45 - highlight what the problem is going to
51:46 - be so actually here we have our design
51:48 - system i'm going to come on and give
51:51 - this a class is equal to font family
51:53 - serif and i know we don't need to do
51:55 - that but you might notice and maybe it
51:57 - looks okay for you but the rendering of
51:59 - things looks a little bizarre on my end
52:01 - and if we look here every single heading
52:04 - level is not using a bold which is the
52:07 - default and because i didn't include the
52:09 - bold from google fonts because we didn't
52:11 - need it for the serif font it actually
52:13 - renders things really bizarrely and so
52:15 - you can play with your font size a
52:16 - little bit if you want to highlight that
52:18 - a little bit but i don't want to have to
52:20 - come in on all my headings because by
52:21 - default they're all bold and have to
52:23 - reset them because this normally
52:24 - wouldn't be bold this wouldn't be all of
52:26 - the headings through here are not
52:28 - nowhere is using the bold so one last
52:30 - extra step that we can take is coming in
52:32 - and just saying that
52:34 - and i don't think we're gonna get to the
52:35 - h6 but i'm still gonna come in and say
52:36 - the font weight here is 400 and if you
52:39 - want to be even more explicit we could
52:41 - also say that my paragraph's default
52:43 - font weight is also 400.
52:45 - because we're not going to see a lot of
52:47 - bold in here but by doing that again the
52:49 - p we might not need but we're just sort
52:50 - of explicitly setting it and even that
52:52 - could be said on the body instead of the
52:54 - paragraph but just by doing that it's
52:56 - going to set us at a little bit of a
52:57 - better starting point as we come through
52:59 - and we can see things are already
53:00 - looking a little bit better so what i'm
53:03 - going to challenge you to do is actually
53:04 - set everything up properly here from our
53:06 - font sizes and our font families you can
53:08 - use the upper case where we need the
53:10 - upper case and in the next video we're
53:12 - going to continue on and look at this
53:14 - section and make sure we can set up
53:15 - everything there to make sure that we
53:17 - have all the utility classes we need and
53:18 - to give ourselves a little bit of
53:20 - practice using them as well
53:24 - all right so i've been very nice to you
53:26 - and i'm not going to make you type out
53:27 - everything we need for all of these
53:29 - different parts because it would just
53:30 - take you a little while and i don't
53:32 - think you'd be benefiting from it too
53:33 - much but i do want you to get some
53:34 - practice using what we've learned so far
53:37 - and i've also done a few things here
53:38 - just some inline styles just to style
53:41 - things and space them out a little bit
53:43 - the one thing i'm going to say now is
53:44 - don't worry about the spaces in between
53:46 - these guys we're just going to try and
53:47 - style this up to be matching what we see
53:50 - as a whole here as closely as possible
53:53 - in terms of font sizes colors and all of
53:55 - that but don't worry about the spacing
53:57 - we're going to come to that in a future
53:59 - lesson and so i'm going to do a couple
54:01 - of these and then get you to do the rest
54:03 - of them and so here we have all of these
54:05 - are actually the same so that speeds
54:07 - things up a little bit we can come on
54:09 - all of those and say that all of these
54:11 - have a class that is equal to uh the
54:14 - text accent and remember that's my color
54:16 - that's going to come on that and so we
54:18 - go and look that's looking pretty much
54:19 - what we need it to be i think and so
54:21 - those are looking pretty good and now
54:23 - the next thing we need to do is actually
54:25 - style these other ones up so here i'm
54:27 - going to do this one class is equal to
54:29 - and on that one it would be my font size
54:31 - 900 and what else we know in there we
54:33 - need an upper case and we need to set
54:35 - the font family so i'm going to come
54:37 - here and say font family of sarah
54:40 - and let's come and actually i'm going to
54:41 - copy this one here and just place it on
54:43 - the next one
54:45 - and then what we're going to do is i
54:47 - want to look at why i like having
54:48 - utility classes and custom properties
54:50 - and all of that set up so here this is
54:53 - going to go down to an 8 and we can see
54:55 - that they're both looking
54:56 - just like they should be looking and so
54:58 - one thing that's nice about this and we
54:59 - can even come and add this on this one
55:03 - and this is where
55:05 - i could have it styling up properly and
55:07 - then i can easily come and change the
55:08 - font size you can see how the same
55:10 - styles are working but things are
55:11 - becoming very plug and play with this
55:13 - approach because i can just plug in the
55:15 - different things that i need but it's
55:17 - also very plug and play because i can
55:18 - easily come on here and say that this
55:20 - should actually be my size condensed
55:22 - instead and in another situation maybe
55:25 - that's exactly what i need right there
55:26 - so the size condensed is coming in and
55:28 - it's working so that's really good and
55:31 - it just makes my life a little bit
55:32 - easier being able to make those changes
55:34 - here plug and play whatever i need and
55:37 - then it's updating and we're getting
55:38 - what we need there but also i could then
55:40 - come over to here and i could actually
55:42 - change what my font family is here and
55:44 - maybe instead of belfair at one point
55:46 - the brand gets updated
55:48 - this ends up becoming something else and
55:50 - let's just take off serif and let's just
55:52 - put this as uh cursive just so we can
55:54 - see then i can quickly update all of the
55:58 - places that were using that in one shot
56:00 - so that is why i like having utility
56:01 - class as well as a custom property it
56:04 - just makes it easier to make big changes
56:06 - or to plug and play and make little
56:07 - changes along the way and we're also
56:09 - going to see with the font sizes that
56:11 - there's even more magic that can happen
56:13 - by having the two of them separated and
56:16 - as i said before too one of the other
56:17 - advantages are we're not worried about
56:19 - the heading level here these are
56:20 - independent classes that can get plugged
56:22 - and played and used anywhere we want so
56:24 - i'm going to leave this like this for
56:25 - you and so i'm going to challenge you to
56:27 - go through and finish the rest of it now
56:29 - because we sort of get an idea of how
56:31 - the flow is and i'm you might be going
56:32 - kevin i can figure this out it's not too
56:34 - hard i really want you practicing to do
56:35 - it so when we get to the actual site
56:37 - itself you sort of remember a lot of
56:39 - these different properties you remember
56:40 - the font sizes you have a little bit of
56:42 - muscle memory built up and in a second
56:44 - i'll run through it and finish it myself
56:45 - as well
56:48 - all right so i already had my class
56:50 - copied so i can paste that in this one's
56:51 - becoming a 600
56:53 - and in this case i think that's perfect
56:56 - then we can come down onto this one and
56:58 - in this case we want it to be a little
57:00 - bit different so we don't have the serif
57:02 - in this situation it's going to be my
57:04 - size condensed
57:06 - and the other thing is we have our
57:07 - letter spacing and this one is the
57:09 - biggest one and it is also uppercase so
57:11 - we're going to leave the uppercase and
57:13 - we can come in here with a
57:14 - letter
57:16 - spacing of one and that should give us
57:19 - exactly what we know except we have of
57:21 - course the wrong font size that should
57:22 - be a 500 and of course this one also has
57:25 - a different color on it so we can come
57:27 - here and say that this should actually
57:28 - be a text accent as well and let's hit
57:30 - save and take a look and there we go i
57:32 - think it's looking pretty good i know
57:33 - it's close to the bottom of the page
57:35 - but you can see that it is coming
57:37 - through and it is starting to work so
57:39 - let's quickly go through and style these
57:41 - ones up as well
57:43 - and there we go we finished all that up
57:45 - and if we go and take a look now
57:47 - everything is starting to come together
57:48 - and match the style that we had with our
57:50 - design system so we know that it is all
57:52 - working it's all looking pretty good now
57:54 - before we jump into the interactive
57:56 - elements which are going to be very fun
57:57 - to style up we are going to look at how
57:59 - we can to fix these titles up to be
58:01 - exactly like how we need them to be and
58:03 - then i'm also going to be looking at how
58:04 - we can add spacing to everything in a
58:06 - very simple easy way and then after that
58:09 - we'll get to the interactive elements
58:13 - all right so we're gonna go into the
58:14 - numbered titles now and those are these
58:17 - guys right here this is not from the
58:18 - design system but you know we recognize
58:20 - them from the design system i'm sure
58:23 - and these are the ones but these are the
58:25 - ones that we see on the actual pages and
58:26 - they're everywhere except for the
58:28 - homepage
58:29 - and
58:30 - i want to look at these in a way talking
58:32 - about how we can find the right balance
58:33 - when it comes to things like utility
58:35 - classes because utility classes
58:37 - definitely allow us to work very quickly
58:39 - as you would have seen when you did that
58:40 - last section we just added those classes
58:42 - in and really quickly we can style any
58:44 - piece of text to look any way we need it
58:46 - to be
58:47 - but when we have something like numbered
58:49 - titles that are always the same it can
58:51 - be a good idea to find a balance
58:54 - and so with these they always have the
58:56 - same font family they always have the
58:58 - same font size they always have the same
59:00 - letter spacing and they always have this
59:02 - number that's the same that's actually
59:03 - like faded out and looks a little
59:05 - different there's always this space here
59:07 - and this is where you'd end up you know
59:09 - having to come up with a new utility
59:11 - class potentially for these numbers and
59:13 - like every single time we do it it's
59:14 - always going to be literally exactly the
59:16 - same so i do think this is where having
59:19 - a little sort of utility class
59:22 - plus
59:23 - uh because it's not quite a component
59:25 - but maybe we could call it like a mini
59:26 - component
59:27 - where those things start to work really
59:29 - well just like we applied several styles
59:31 - to our body to allow us to work a little
59:33 - bit faster
59:34 - and it really depends on your workflow
59:36 - and how you like to work but i'm going
59:38 - to be setting up a specific class just
59:40 - for these numbered titles
59:41 - so it does a little bit more than what
59:43 - you might consider a
59:45 - normal
59:46 - utility class to do but let's just come
59:48 - and we're going to add it here and we'll
59:49 - call it numbered
59:51 - title because it describes exactly what
59:53 - it is and
59:55 - there's a few different things we're
59:56 - going to want to do and what i'm going
59:58 - to do before anything else is let's come
60:00 - up and add that class all the way on our
60:02 - first one that we had in our colors area
60:04 - which is right here
60:06 - i'm actually going to delete this
60:07 - uppercase and i'm going to call this
60:10 - numbered
60:11 - title just like that and i'm going to
60:14 - challenge you to style it up and make it
60:16 - look the way we want it to be uh you'll
60:18 - notice there is a span in here and so
60:20 - you know we want to take advantage of
60:21 - that do the best you can on it even if
60:24 - you're really not sure where to start we
60:25 - have all of our custom properties that
60:26 - you can rely on and if you get stuck at
60:28 - anything don't worry too much about it
60:31 - and do your best to style it up and i'll
60:33 - give you my solution in just a few
60:35 - seconds
60:38 - all right so for these we have a few
60:40 - different things we need to do one of
60:41 - them is going to be my font family which
60:43 - is going to be my size condensed so once
60:45 - again i'm just going to do that double
60:47 - ff and then i can find my songs
60:48 - condensed really nice and easily
60:51 - we also want to set our font size which
60:53 - always is the same one and in this case
60:55 - it's once again fs and it's right there
60:57 - i just have to choose the right one and
60:59 - it will be 500 in this case then we need
61:01 - to come in and set a text transform
61:04 - of uppercase and again you could mix and
61:07 - match a little bit with utility classes
61:08 - here as well and that there's nothing
61:10 - wrong with doing that
61:12 - so maybe you want to mix it with your
61:13 - letter spacing one but i'm just going to
61:15 - come in and do this and i just realized
61:17 - i didn't talk about why i set these in
61:19 - pixels and earlier i talked about
61:21 - setting font sizes with
61:23 - rems and if you know me i like m's and
61:25 - rams for most things when it comes to
61:27 - sizing things and
61:30 - here i left the pixels just it's just
61:31 - these like decimal points that are very
61:33 - specific and they're very
61:35 - small numbers so i thought it was fine
61:36 - to leave them as pixel values
61:38 - that's just the reason why i did that so
61:40 - there's nothing wrong with using pixels
61:42 - for very small things or very specific
61:44 - things every now and then and so if we
61:46 - go and look at what we have we can see
61:47 - it's coming together pretty good
61:49 - compared to the design of what we want
61:51 - it to look like i think it's actually
61:53 - very close the only issue is our numbers
61:55 - over here
61:57 - and this is one of those places that the
61:59 - custom properties for my colors that i
62:01 - set up are really going to shine so i'm
62:04 - going to create a number title span
62:06 - and you'll notice i'm not putting a
62:08 - different class here you might hear that
62:10 - you should use a class for absolutely
62:11 - everything but as we go through this
62:13 - we're going to see that sometimes maybe
62:15 - you don't want to and doing something
62:17 - like this and if you want to be very
62:18 - specific you could do something like
62:20 - that
62:21 - but when we have a span inside our
62:23 - number title i want to style it in a
62:25 - specific way and this sort of scopes the
62:27 - style of the span to the numbered title
62:29 - it can't escape out of there and we're
62:31 - going to see this as we work on some
62:32 - other things the first thing we do is
62:34 - add a margin to the right side and i'm
62:36 - going to try 0.5 m which is the
62:39 - if you don't know m it's going to be
62:40 - relative to this font size so that means
62:43 - if ever we had a different font size
62:44 - that would come on that spacing would
62:46 - adapt with it and there we go we got a
62:48 - nice healthy space right there
62:50 - we also need it to be bold
62:52 - a font weight
62:54 - of 700
62:55 - and the last thing we need to do is to
62:57 - change the color of it because obviously
62:59 - it's not the right color and if you try
63:01 - the accent you'll also realize it's not
63:03 - the right color if you look in the figma
63:04 - file the opacity of it is 25
63:07 - so if you haven't already done it or you
63:09 - weren't able to do that the only thing
63:11 - left is to do this color see if you can
63:12 - think of how to do it we looked at it
63:14 - briefly when i looked at how i set up my
63:16 - colors with the custom properties if you
63:18 - forget that's okay but pause think about
63:20 - it maybe even go back to that video when
63:22 - i set it all up to remind yourself so
63:24 - you can try it and do it now to see if
63:26 - you can get it to work or not and i'll
63:27 - give you the solution in just a few
63:29 - seconds
63:31 - all right so i hope you did it i hope
63:32 - you gave it a shot and hopefully you got
63:34 - it right but if not no big deal remember
63:36 - from now on and that's where i want to
63:38 - come in with an hsl value and then in
63:40 - here we can do my custom property so i
63:42 - want this custom property my color light
63:45 - or color white i should say because we
63:47 - want to keep it white but it's at 25
63:49 - percent so what i can then do is the
63:51 - forward slash and 0.25 which sets the
63:54 - alpha value and if we go and take a look
63:56 - now look at that
63:58 - perfect it's exactly what we needed so
64:01 - there we go it's the numbered titles
64:02 - that are set up so we can then run
64:04 - through just take this numbered title
64:06 - class apply it anywhere we need it and
64:08 - in these cases it just so happens to be
64:10 - on an h2 but it could be something that
64:13 - it doesn't have to be on an h2 this
64:14 - could be on an h1 or it could be on a
64:16 - paragraph or it could be on anything
64:18 - it's a class that can be plug and played
64:19 - and used in any way that we need it to
64:21 - be and so with that done we can move on
64:23 - to adding the spacing that we need with
64:25 - a very convenient way to add spacing in
64:27 - my opinion and then after that we'll get
64:29 - into those interactive components
64:33 - all right so we're going to be looking
64:34 - now at how we can add the spacing in
64:36 - ways that is very adaptable and very
64:38 - easy to update depending on the type of
64:40 - spacing we need and we can do this with
64:43 - a utility class and there are also other
64:46 - common systems where you're using
64:48 - utility classes like m1 m2 m3 p1 p2 p3
64:52 - to add margin or padding around elements
64:54 - then you have other utility classes like
64:56 - mx2 which would be only left and right
64:59 - and then m y2 which would only be top
65:01 - and bottom and so on and so forth you do
65:03 - it with borders as well and those can be
65:06 - very useful but in this case i don't
65:08 - think we need it for this design and i
65:10 - want to show you a very modern approach
65:11 - that we can take to doing it with just
65:13 - one utility class and a modern pseudo
65:16 - class that's recently been added to css
65:18 - which does have good browser support
65:20 - with the modern browsers because we
65:22 - don't need all those other utility
65:23 - classes and i think it's going to speed
65:25 - us up overall just by using the one so
65:27 - if we dive back into here i'm going to
65:29 - go to my css file and i'm actually going
65:31 - to come up back into this section here
65:33 - which is my general utility classes and
65:36 - here we're going to do is we're going to
65:37 - create one called dot flow and if you
65:39 - remember earlier when i talked about the
65:40 - reset i talked about somebody called
65:42 - andy bell and this is also where this
65:44 - idea originates from and where i picked
65:46 - it up and andy is a very smart css
65:49 - person so if you want to give them a
65:50 - follow i'd always recommend it and i'm
65:52 - going to start this off how andy does it
65:54 - and then i'm going to make a modified
65:55 - version of it of how i'm going to do it
65:57 - which i think makes it a little bit more
65:59 - readable and what i'm going to do right
66:01 - now is add a margin top of one rem we're
66:04 - going to modify this but i'm also going
66:05 - to put an outline just so we can
66:06 - actually see what this is doing one
66:08 - pixel solid red so maybe you've already
66:10 - seen this this is the lobotomized owl
66:12 - but if you haven't it can be kind of
66:14 - confusing so i want to take a quick look
66:16 - at how this is going to work
66:18 - if you've already seen it and you
66:19 - understand how it works you can skip
66:21 - ahead a little bit in the video because
66:23 - i will be modifying this and i will
66:25 - actually be modifying this right here so
66:27 - don't skip to the next lesson just skip
66:30 - ahead within this lesson to when i make
66:32 - these adjustments but i want to explain
66:34 - how this is working first it won't take
66:36 - me very long to do and we're going to
66:38 - come into this section here which is my
66:39 - typography
66:40 - and in here where i have this div class
66:43 - i'm going to add a or i have a div and
66:46 - i'm going to add a class
66:48 - at that class of flow
66:50 - and we're going to look at what it does
66:52 - and you'll notice now that we have earth
66:54 - doesn't have a box around it but these
66:56 - four do
66:57 - and if we look here the direct children
67:00 - of flow has my heading 1 and then we
67:02 - also have this div this div this div and
67:04 - they're all getting a red border around
67:06 - it
67:07 - except for this one and the way that
67:09 - this selector here which again this is
67:11 - it was hayden pickering who termed the
67:12 - coin the lobotomized owl the way that
67:15 - this is working is it's
67:17 - the plus here is an adjacent sibling
67:19 - combinator so it's looking for elements
67:21 - that have adjacent siblings that come
67:23 - before it so select everything that has
67:26 - an adjacent sibling before it or a
67:28 - sibling directly before it so if we look
67:30 - here we have this guy does he have a
67:32 - sibling before it he does
67:35 - does this one have a sibling before it
67:36 - he does does this one yes does this one
67:39 - yes and does this one no he doesn't have
67:41 - a sibling before it he doesn't have it
67:43 - he doesn't get any of those styles
67:45 - applied to him
67:46 - now the one complaint that i hear about
67:49 - this is it's
67:50 - it's hard to read if you didn't get the
67:52 - explanation that i just gave to you and
67:53 - you just stumbled across it it can be
67:55 - hard to understand you could come in
67:57 - with a comment to explain what it's
67:59 - actually doing
68:00 - or we can do it another way that a lot
68:02 - of people like which is the star and
68:04 - then not and then we can do a first
68:06 - child and this isn't the finished
68:07 - version we're going to modify this again
68:09 - from here but this is doing the exact
68:11 - same thing it's saying anything that's
68:13 - not the first child and if we come and
68:16 - take a look now we can see that it's
68:18 - exactly what we had before and if you're
68:20 - going why why are we not selecting the
68:21 - first child or you could also do this
68:24 - with last child as well some people like
68:26 - doing it with last child and doing this
68:28 - as a margin bottom instead so either way
68:30 - would work perfectly fine because you
68:31 - can see it's selecting all of them
68:33 - except for the last one
68:34 - and the reason we like doing that is
68:36 - just really fast let's come in here i'm
68:38 - going to come in on this guy right here
68:40 - where we have the flow and i'm going to
68:43 - add a background of pink
68:46 - and let's add padding of 1m just so we
68:49 - have something on there
68:51 - and notice the spacing on everything is
68:53 - nice and consistent the space on the top
68:55 - is one m padding the space on the bottom
68:57 - is one m of padding as well and i
68:59 - realize the contrast and that's really
69:01 - terrible with our text colors so we'll
69:02 - get rid of this in a second
69:04 - but if we did the same thing where we're
69:06 - just adding the padding on everything
69:08 - but we say we just did this instead
69:11 - where we're adding the margin bottom
69:12 - well now it's going to mess up my
69:14 - spacing here this space here is actually
69:16 - twice as big as the space on the top so
69:18 - what we're trying to do here is say the
69:19 - first element has no space on the top
69:21 - and the last element has no space on the
69:23 - bottom
69:25 - i'm very used to doing this
69:27 - with doing it on the margin top version
69:29 - of it with this being first child so i'm
69:32 - going to work this way you can in the
69:34 - future if ever you use this you could
69:36 - choose whichever way makes more sense to
69:37 - you but this is just what i've gotten
69:39 - used to and i use it basically in all my
69:41 - projects now so i'm gonna leave it like
69:43 - that and now we can go through and get
69:45 - rid of that pink background color all
69:48 - right and now what i'm going to do is uh
69:50 - i said i'm going to do one more
69:52 - modification to this and the reason that
69:54 - andy does it with the star plus star is
69:57 - this has no extra specificity to it the
69:59 - flow has the specificity which is
70:01 - important because on our paragraphs and
70:03 - all our headings we set a margin of zero
70:04 - so we need this to overwrite that to add
70:06 - a margin top on them but this doesn't
70:09 - actually add any specificity whereas
70:11 - when we do this this is a pseudo class
70:13 - which has the same specificity as a
70:15 - class selector and that does lead to
70:18 - potential problems where you can't
70:20 - overwrite something or you need an
70:22 - important somewhere which you probably
70:24 - don't want to have to do or worry about
70:26 - so one way that we can actually overcome
70:28 - that is with a very modern piece of css
70:31 - and it makes this a little bit more
70:32 - verbose but we can add a where and if
70:35 - you've never seen this uh where and is
70:37 - our new selectors that we have
70:40 - this
70:41 - if we didn't is it's not actually going
70:43 - to help at all it's the exact same
70:45 - situation
70:46 - and where and is are generally used as a
70:49 - different way to group things so before
70:51 - you might do a let's just say we had
70:54 - um a card and i know we don't have one
70:55 - but i would say you had a card and you
70:57 - wanted to style titles in it so you had
70:58 - card h1 card h2 card h3
71:03 - and that can be kind of annoying to have
71:05 - to write out the same thing with your
71:06 - nested selector like that so what you
71:08 - can actually do now is card where and
71:10 - then say h1 h2 h3 and that would be
71:14 - exactly the same thing or you could also
71:15 - have an is here
71:17 - the difference between is and where is
71:19 - where has where is will take the highest
71:22 - specificity selector inside here and
71:24 - apply it to that entire rule where on
71:26 - the other hand and doesn't add any
71:28 - specificity so everything in here gets
71:31 - no added specificity so it just helps
71:33 - keep it a little bit lower this is
71:34 - actually used in the sanitize css reset
71:37 - now and i've started seeing it in other
71:38 - resets as well so it's a nice so it is
71:41 - sort of a new way that we can eliminate
71:43 - specificity from selectors to make it
71:45 - easier to overwrite in situations where
71:46 - we might have to i'm actually going to
71:48 - leave the outline on here just so it's
71:50 - easier to visualize what's happening but
71:52 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to
71:53 - change my margin top here to be a
71:56 - var of flow space
71:59 - and i don't want this float space it
72:00 - doesn't exist it's doing nothing now i'm
72:02 - going to do comma 1 rem
72:04 - and this could actually be another
72:06 - custom property if you wanted to have
72:07 - like a spacer custom property at the top
72:10 - and then you know all of these could
72:11 - actually use a spacer custom property
72:12 - but i won't get into that now we'll keep
72:14 - things a little simpler
72:16 - but just like i said these gaps up here
72:17 - and i said these could become very
72:19 - useful this is an undefined custom
72:21 - property so the one rem becomes the
72:22 - default so let's go back to our design
72:24 - system where we have our flow here and
72:26 - i'm going to come down onto this one and
72:28 - i'm also going to add the class equals
72:30 - flow on this one as well and we can see
72:32 - it's working in both of those sections
72:34 - the way it's intended to work but just
72:36 - to show you where the power of this
72:38 - comes from is
72:39 - i can come now on an inline style and
72:41 - one popular way to do this is with
72:43 - inline style and of course you could
72:45 - come in with an extra class and modify
72:47 - it on a class 2 which is something we'll
72:48 - see later in the course but what i can
72:50 - do on here is i can actually redefine my
72:52 - custom property so i can say that my
72:54 - flow space
72:55 - is four rem
72:58 - and if i do that you can see this
73:00 - spacing is now at four and this one over
73:03 - here on this side has stayed at one rem
73:05 - and you might be able to already see a
73:06 - little bit of the power that can come
73:07 - from something like this
73:09 - so just for now what i'm going to do is
73:11 - i'm going to come here and i'm going to
73:13 - add it
73:14 - here just so the two sections are
73:15 - actually consistent with one another and
73:17 - the spacing comes in might be a little
73:18 - big compared to the actual figma file
73:21 - but it's not terrible i'm going to leave
73:22 - the outline on here just so it makes it
73:24 - easier to visualize if changes are
73:26 - working and how things are working and
73:28 - i'm going to recommend that you go
73:29 - through on the color section here and
73:31 - you play with it that you come down here
73:33 - and play with this a little bit
73:34 - especially if you're not used to it to
73:36 - see how it could work how you can
73:37 - manipulate things you can try doing it
73:39 - with classes within your css as well
73:41 - instead of just applying it
73:43 - to is an inline style if you want to
73:46 - experiment a little bit with that and
73:48 - once you're done playing with that once
73:49 - you feel comfortable with it then i'll
73:50 - see you in the next video where we're
73:52 - going to be diving into the interactive
73:54 - elements
73:57 - all right so i'm sure you've been
73:58 - looking forward to this for a little bit
73:59 - getting into the more interactive things
74:01 - and we have all these different
74:03 - interactive elements that we have to
74:05 - build out and there are some
74:06 - similarities between some of them that
74:07 - we'll be able to take advantage of and
74:09 - just looking quickly at them we have
74:10 - different states for all of them right
74:12 - we have hover states neutral states and
74:14 - active states and we'll dive more into
74:17 - the ones that have three states shortly
74:19 - but we're going to start with this which
74:20 - only has the regular state as well as a
74:22 - hover state on there and it'd be a nice
74:24 - jumping off point i think before we get
74:25 - into some of these other ones that are a
74:27 - little bit more complex
74:28 - and so this explore button it's very
74:30 - unique to the entire site which is
74:32 - important because often buttons and i'm
74:34 - calling it a button it is a link
74:36 - but it's sort of this big buttony thing
74:37 - that we can click on and often buttons
74:40 - have a whole bunch of different versions
74:42 - of buttons throughout a site we don't
74:43 - have to have one with primary color
74:44 - secondary colored tertiary colors and
74:46 - all of that we just have to have this
74:49 - one guy right here and another thing
74:52 - that's interesting is we do have these
74:53 - two states but could we add some
74:56 - animations to it as well that is
74:58 - something when you get static designs
75:00 - that we can't always explore some teams
75:02 - will have people who animate them to
75:04 - show the dev what it should look like in
75:06 - this case we don't have that so we're
75:07 - gonna have to figure that out on our own
75:09 - and make some decisions so let's jump on
75:12 - over to the code and you can see i've
75:13 - actually set things up a little bit here
75:15 - in this interactive elements section
75:16 - that i've created and actually you know
75:18 - what we should also have a class is
75:20 - equal to flow on there just add a little
75:21 - bit of spacing
75:23 - and you can see i've set up a section
75:24 - for our navigation and right here i've
75:26 - set up a spot for our button and in this
75:30 - case because it is a link i am going to
75:32 - style it with a link it could be
75:35 - something that could be a link or a
75:36 - button so we could add extra styling to
75:38 - it but because i know it's going to be a
75:40 - regular link on a site that's just going
75:42 - to bring us to another page it's not
75:44 - something where we're opening a modal
75:46 - we're not interacting like that i'm
75:48 - going to be just doing it on a regular
75:49 - link here and then we're going to give
75:51 - this a class and i'm going to call it
75:53 - large button instead of explore button
75:56 - just because
75:57 - trying to forward think it might change
75:59 - the text inside of it might change one
76:01 - day
76:02 - it could also end up maybe the site gets
76:04 - bigger they need more large buttons on
76:06 - other pages so i just think it makes it
76:08 - a little bit more versatile and we'll
76:09 - write explorer in there close a and
76:13 - before i do anything else let's go take
76:14 - a look at what that actually looks like
76:16 - it's all the way down at the bottom it's
76:18 - this blue thing there and you know what
76:19 - i'm going to do um i'm going to add on
76:21 - this div right here i'm going to do a
76:23 - style is equal to margin bottom of 50 vh
76:28 - just so when we're working here i can
76:29 - actually scroll down and we can see what
76:31 - we're looking at and we have some margin
76:33 - down there at the bottom so we have an
76:34 - explore button that looks like this and
76:36 - what i want you to do is before we even
76:38 - do anything
76:39 - could we
76:41 - one thing we could think of is maybe we
76:43 - could style a lot of these things up
76:44 - with utility classes instead of styling
76:47 - everything specific to the large button
76:49 - so there are some things the large
76:51 - button will have to have so we can't
76:52 - make it a circle and we can't do the
76:54 - hover effects but we can add utility
76:56 - classes here to get us along all the way
76:59 - and i'm going to tell you why i think it
77:01 - could be a good idea in this situation
77:03 - compared to when we did our
77:05 - numbered titles here so add as many
77:07 - utility classes as we have they can get
77:09 - us closer and then we'll talk about it
77:11 - more in just a few seconds
77:15 - all right so i'm going to come in we're
77:17 - going to add an upper case on there we
77:18 - can add a font family of serif and we
77:21 - can add the text dark and a bg of white
77:24 - and it's not all the way there but look
77:25 - at that it's coming together pretty
77:27 - nicely and there's one more that we
77:29 - could also add on here actually which
77:30 - would be my font size of 600 just to
77:32 - give us the right font size and it's
77:34 - coming together and i know it's not all
77:36 - the way there uh but it is a decent
77:39 - start and one of the reasons i like that
77:41 - idea is maybe in the future it gets
77:43 - updated maybe we need a second button
77:46 - right so someone you know they add
77:47 - another design somewhere else where
77:49 - there's a second button that comes in it
77:51 - looks exactly the same but maybe this
77:53 - time it actually needs to be a bit
77:54 - smaller so it's going to be the small
77:56 - version of the same thing and
77:58 - we don't need to create a new class to
78:00 - be able to accommodate it we could just
78:02 - update the
78:04 - font size here and it's going to change
78:05 - it or maybe they decide that
78:08 - there's going to be two buttons that are
78:10 - next to each other an explorer and a
78:12 - different button and one of them is
78:13 - going to be a white background and
78:15 - another one is going to be the accent
78:17 - background and then so we can get the
78:19 - two different buttons very easily very
78:21 - quickly so
78:22 - setting these up with some utility
78:24 - classes and then finishing things up
78:26 - with my large button class that will add
78:28 - the finishing touches is one approach
78:31 - you could take and one that i'm going to
78:32 - stick with in this case
78:35 - you might say that we could do the same
78:36 - thing on the number title and 100 you
78:38 - could take the same approach there but i
78:39 - do want to show you different ways of
78:41 - working at the same time and one thing
78:42 - just very quickly if you are going to
78:44 - take this approach with utility classes
78:46 - and a component type class here
78:49 - is i would always start with this one
78:50 - and then add the utilities after or vice
78:53 - versa do all the utilities first and
78:55 - then add the
78:56 - more component based one after
78:59 - just to make it so it's very consistent
79:01 - every time you do it is i prefer having
79:03 - the component first and then all my
79:05 - utility classes just because of what i'm
79:07 - used to but if you think the other way
79:09 - around makes more sense it's up to you
79:11 - and so i'm gonna hit save on that we
79:12 - have my explore button there so let's
79:14 - come down into my css file and i'm
79:16 - actually gonna go all the way to the top
79:17 - just for one second to grab this guy and
79:20 - then we're gonna go all the way back
79:21 - down because now we're outside of the
79:23 - utilities and we're coming into the
79:25 - world of components
79:28 - and components are things that are a
79:29 - little bit bigger they have more pieces
79:31 - going on there's multiple things inside
79:33 - of them now this button it's it's not
79:35 - really multiple things it's just one
79:36 - thing but it still falls into that world
79:38 - of components
79:39 - but the other things in our design
79:41 - system
79:42 - like these these are definitely
79:44 - components where we have different
79:45 - pieces that are all part of one bigger
79:47 - thing so we're going to enter into the
79:49 - world of components for these
79:51 - interactive elements and we call this a
79:53 - large button so what i'm going to
79:55 - suggest now is style this up do what you
79:56 - can with it don't worry about the hover
79:58 - state yet though because i want to show
79:59 - you my solution to this before you go
80:01 - into the hover state because i'll give
80:02 - you another challenge uh once we finish
80:04 - this to do the hover state on the button
80:06 - there so start off right here go for it
80:09 - get it as close as possible as you can
80:11 - and then i'll come in and give you my
80:12 - solution
80:15 - all right so the very first thing i'm
80:16 - going to do is give this guy a bit of
80:18 - padding and i'm going to actually do
80:20 - padding of 0 on the top and bottom and a
80:24 - 2m on the left and the right and the
80:25 - reason i'm using m here is if ever the
80:27 - font size were to change the padding
80:28 - would grow or shrink with it so that is
80:31 - a little bit handy there and again this
80:33 - is to try and make it a little bit more
80:34 - robust and we can see that that is
80:36 - coming in and giving us a bit of size on
80:38 - the left and the right and because we do
80:40 - want to give it some height one thing i
80:41 - usually want buttons is i give them very
80:43 - often a display of inline block in this
80:46 - case i'm actually going to instead of
80:48 - that give it a display of grid and i'll
80:49 - explain why afterward
80:51 - and not too long just in a few seconds
80:53 - but uh it is important we change the
80:55 - display here because we are working with
80:57 - a link which is an inline element we
80:59 - can't really give that padding top and
81:01 - bottom you can but it doesn't work or a
81:03 - height wouldn't work on it
81:05 - and it would actually overlap with the
81:07 - content that's here if we can get the
81:08 - padding working so i'm doing a display
81:10 - grid often it would be a display inline
81:12 - block and
81:14 - then i do need to give it a height right
81:16 - and a lot of people would come in with a
81:18 - height of say 100 pixels and a width of
81:21 - 100 pixels and not have the padding
81:23 - instead so we can actually get
81:25 - an actual size but we have modern css
81:27 - solutions that we can use instead and
81:29 - i'm going to give this an aspect ratio
81:32 - and this is a really nice little bit of
81:34 - modern css it is supported in all modern
81:36 - browsers now and you can see it turns
81:38 - that into a perfect square isn't that
81:40 - cool uh and you could play around with
81:42 - aspect ratio i'm doing one which is the
81:45 - same as saying one over one but you
81:47 - could come in here and say it's a two
81:48 - over one so then it's twice as wide as
81:51 - it is high or you could come in and do
81:53 - the opposite with like a one uh with a
81:56 - one over two it's gonna be twice as tall
81:58 - as it is wide so it's always the width
82:00 - over the height now i'm just gonna put
82:01 - this back to a one so we have our nice
82:03 - perfect square but if you do feel like
82:04 - you wanna play around with that a little
82:06 - bit and have some fun with it go ahead
82:07 - and then when you're ready you can
82:08 - resume the lesson
82:10 - but what i'm going to do now is come in
82:12 - on here and right now there's two things
82:14 - one there's the underline on the text
82:15 - that we want to get rid of but we also
82:17 - need to get that text in the middle and
82:18 - this is why i use grid instead of a
82:20 - block or inline block because then i can
82:22 - just do a place items or place content i
82:24 - think would work here as well uh center
82:26 - and this is a shorthand for align items
82:29 - and justify items and we only have one
82:31 - thing in there it will put it right in
82:33 - the middle and just a nice easy way you
82:35 - could do the same thing with flexbox you
82:36 - just need an extra line so with grid we
82:39 - can do it with one right there so that
82:40 - works really well and then we do want to
82:42 - get rid of that text decoration so we
82:44 - can do text decoration of none and of
82:46 - course we want to have the border radius
82:48 - which i'm going to keep over here with
82:49 - the padding and a border radius of 50
82:52 - to give us a nice perfect circle and
82:55 - there we go i think that's looking
82:56 - pretty good and we are gonna get that
82:58 - like the glowy bit that's going to be
83:00 - coming on this uh shortly so what i'm
83:02 - actually going to do
83:04 - is just in my inline styles here
83:07 - uh on this even i'm just going to do a
83:09 - style is equal to a margin top of 5 ram
83:13 - just to give us a little bit of space
83:15 - here so when we do that it doesn't clash
83:17 - with the text that we have on top of
83:19 - there but that's just for that because
83:21 - now i want to challenge you to create
83:23 - that glowing effect and if you can think
83:25 - of a way to do that and so i'm actually
83:27 - going to do that in the next video so
83:29 - i'm challenging you to do all of the
83:30 - work right now here in this scrim and
83:32 - then see my solution in the next one but
83:34 - if you do need a hint to get you started
83:36 - i will give you one at the beginning of
83:37 - the next video but i really would
83:38 - encourage you to try this out on your
83:40 - own see if you can get there and then if
83:41 - you need a few hints along the way then
83:43 - you can see my solution world i'm going
83:44 - to pause along the way a few times to
83:46 - give you a chance to give it your own
83:48 - try so good luck with it and i'll see
83:50 - you in the next video when you're ready
83:55 - all right so if you're here just for the
83:56 - hint i'm going to start with that where
83:58 - i'm going to start off with a large
83:59 - button and i'm going to use a pseudo
84:01 - element for this and there could be
84:03 - other ways to achieve this but
84:04 - pseudo-elements are something that i
84:06 - really like and for decorative elements
84:08 - like this it's just really easy to do
84:09 - and it gives us a lot of possibilities
84:11 - on the types of animations and other
84:12 - things that we can do with it so if you
84:14 - weren't sure where to start and now this
84:16 - gives you a little bit of an idea you
84:17 - can take off from here and then in just
84:19 - a few seconds i'll give you the rest of
84:21 - my solution on animating this background
84:23 - glowy thing that we're going to add in
84:24 - here
84:26 - all right so the very first thing we
84:27 - need whenever we have a pseudo element
84:29 - is the content property because without
84:30 - it we won't have a pseudo element that's
84:32 - there and i know i'm going to want a
84:33 - position of absolute on here so we can
84:35 - add that right away and just to make
84:37 - sure that things don't get out of hand
84:39 - or you know out of the way i'm going to
84:41 - come up onto my large button and give
84:42 - this a position of relative just so this
84:44 - becomes the containing block for my
84:46 - absolute positioned element over here
84:48 - now i think a good thing to do so we can
84:50 - actually see it and position it i always
84:51 - like just giving them a background of
84:53 - red so we can see what's actually
84:55 - happening and well we could give it a
84:57 - top bottom left and right all of zero
84:58 - there's other solutions one of them you
85:00 - could use inset um of zero or you could
85:03 - just come in with a width and a height
85:04 - of 100 and that should work too and we
85:07 - can see my red box is showing up right
85:10 - there and the next thing is obviously we
85:12 - do want the shape of it to match so
85:13 - there's two choices here on the border
85:15 - radius we could either do a 50 here to
85:17 - make it a circle or if you wanted to you
85:19 - could actually make that inherit and
85:20 - then it would match the border radius of
85:22 - the parent but i think the 50 here is
85:24 - fine and now we can see that it has
85:26 - become a circle so we're on the right
85:28 - track but we can see that's given us the
85:30 - nice perfect circle here so that's going
85:31 - to work and we're on the right track but
85:33 - obviously there is a big problem now in
85:34 - that it's covering the text and we
85:36 - definitely don't want it to be doing
85:38 - that we need to see the explore text and
85:40 - one way we can do that is to come on
85:42 - here and i'm gonna go where i have my
85:44 - position and add a z index of negative
85:47 - one which is going to push it all the
85:49 - way back um the problem with this is it
85:51 - pushes it so far back if we have other
85:53 - elements like a background image or
85:55 - other things it could actually get lost
85:56 - behind them so even though we could
85:58 - technically get it visible right now
86:00 - just to prevent potential problems from
86:02 - happening in the future i will come up
86:04 - on the display here and add a z index of
86:06 - one and what this is doing is creating a
86:08 - new stacking context and that means that
86:10 - this negative one it is below everything
86:13 - so it's still a negative z index but it
86:15 - can't escape outside of my large button
86:17 - so if we go and take a look at it now
86:18 - you can actually see the text even
86:20 - though it's in front of the white
86:22 - background if i take this off
86:24 - you'll actually see that it's gone below
86:26 - my white background that i had on there
86:28 - and well that might be something that
86:29 - you're thinking well that's exactly what
86:31 - we want kevin we're going to be using
86:32 - white anyway so it doesn't really matter
86:34 - and again this i don't think we'd run
86:37 - into a problem with it on this site but
86:39 - whenever i have a absolutely positioned
86:41 - element within something else it's
86:43 - usually a good idea to force a new
86:45 - stacking context just to prevent weird
86:47 - problems from happening especially
86:48 - because you might end up doing an
86:49 - animation or transition that creates a
86:51 - new stacking context anyway and then all
86:53 - of a sudden things are changing when the
86:55 - animation's happening which could be an
86:57 - absolute nightmare so this is a nice fix
87:00 - of course this background actually won't
87:01 - be red like i just mentioned on this we
87:04 - can use my hsl and use our color white
87:07 - and i think we're going to try like a
87:08 - 0.15 and we'll see how that looks uh but
87:11 - we need to add the animation in now and
87:13 - if you didn't already do this part and
87:15 - you sort of wanted to follow along a
87:16 - little bit to set the stage now you
87:18 - could also try and just do the animation
87:20 - for it at this stage and we're not going
87:22 - to do anything too complex and if you're
87:24 - not too sure where to start i will give
87:26 - a small hint in just a second so if you
87:28 - need a little push in the right
87:29 - direction just wait around or if not hit
87:31 - pause right now and jump into it
87:34 - all right so the hint here is if you
87:36 - aren't used to using or animating sugar
87:37 - elements we want this to be on hover so
87:40 - we do have to choose our large button to
87:41 - hover and then choose the after here to
87:44 - be able to do the hover animation on it
87:47 - and uh because we are doing a hover we
87:50 - should also come in and add in a focus
87:53 - here as well so if somebody tabs onto it
87:55 - we still get the same type of effect
87:57 - going so if that was the little push you
87:58 - needed just to get you started you can
88:00 - go ahead and add your animation in now
88:02 - and i'll come in with my final solution
88:04 - in just a few seconds
88:07 - all right so uh with that working i'm
88:09 - actually going to move my background
88:10 - just because of how i like to organize
88:11 - my own css i'm going to move that right
88:13 - to here
88:14 - not that it changes anything in the big
88:16 - picture of things and then we can come
88:17 - on here and i'm going to here do a
88:20 - transform and do a scale of about 1.5 i
88:23 - think that's going to work out nicely
88:24 - and let's go take a look before i add
88:26 - the animation on that and we can see
88:28 - that there we go it's getting bigger and
88:30 - smaller which is exactly what we wanted
88:32 - now one thing that's really important
88:33 - with this instead of doing an animation
88:35 - on the width and the height which are
88:36 - actually kind of expensive for the
88:38 - browser to do if we do that it would
88:40 - actually even though we've positioned
88:41 - this absolute it could potentially lead
88:44 - to repaints and actually reflows of
88:46 - content on the page when you do
88:47 - animations or transitions on the
88:49 - transforms like scale translate or
88:51 - rotate then those don't actually cause
88:53 - any reflows on the page and they're also
88:55 - gpu accelerated so you get some nice
88:58 - smoother animations that way and it's a
88:59 - bit easier for the browser and so with
89:02 - that we just need to come up on here and
89:03 - we can add a transition so we can do
89:05 - transition and i want to do my transform
89:08 - let's say 500 milliseconds and i'll just
89:10 - do an ease in out and so if we go and
89:13 - take a look at it we can see that we get
89:15 - now a nice little animation that happens
89:17 - there and i think we can improve that
89:19 - just a touch so we can keep that like
89:21 - that but another thing i'm going to do
89:23 - is i'm actually going to change the
89:24 - opacity here to zero
89:26 - and on here we can then say that the
89:28 - opacity becomes one now this isn't
89:31 - actually going to be transitioning so
89:32 - you can link together multiple ones go
89:35 - ahead and do opacity 500 milliseconds
89:37 - and linear and you just come and
89:39 - separate them and you might be wondering
89:40 - well why do both of them and not just do
89:42 - an all again i want to choose the
89:43 - different ones that i'm doing i can
89:44 - choose different timing functions for
89:46 - them by doing it this way so that can be
89:48 - a nice little touch so now we should see
89:50 - see the opacity it just gives it a nice
89:52 - little the glow comes in as it's
89:54 - expanding and then it sort of fades out
89:56 - at the same time so i think that looks a
89:57 - little better
89:58 - and i said we can have different timing
90:00 - functions but we can also have different
90:02 - times as well and you can even have
90:04 - delays on some of them if you want and
90:05 - not on other ones so by separating out
90:07 - the different properties you're doing
90:08 - you're getting that extra level of
90:10 - control and you won't accidentally
90:11 - animate things that you're not meaning
90:13 - to do as well so i always like
90:15 - specifying the exact things that i want
90:17 - to actually be animating and now if we
90:19 - go take a look
90:20 - i just think that looks really great and
90:22 - the opacity being at a little bit of a
90:23 - different speed than the transition for
90:25 - me gives it a nice little extra effect
90:28 - and i think it looks pretty good now if
90:30 - you want to step your game up and
90:31 - experiment with this a little bit more
90:32 - i'd suggest going in and trying to play
90:34 - with these timing functions here and if
90:36 - you haven't done things with cubic
90:37 - beziers before this could be a nice
90:39 - opportunity to get it more to like snap
90:40 - into place or to do a little bounce or
90:42 - to come up with some interesting effects
90:44 - but this is my final solution so i'm
90:46 - going to encourage you to play with it
90:47 - some more and when you're ready i'll see
90:49 - you in the next lesson
90:53 - all right so we move on to the next
90:55 - element which is going to be our
90:56 - underline indicators and not
90:58 - specifically the navigation
91:00 - and that reason is you can see here i
91:02 - have an underline indicator here i have
91:03 - one over here we have some two and uh so
91:07 - these indicators we have a hover state
91:08 - and an active state for them and you'll
91:10 - notice even though this is the
91:12 - navigation and this one over here is
91:14 - some tabs
91:15 - it's just an underline so we have
91:18 - the navigation with an underline and
91:19 - over here we have the the tabs over here
91:21 - with the same type of underlying action
91:23 - going on the hover states the same and
91:25 - everything there's some spacing
91:26 - differences and some minor changes to
91:28 - them but overall they're very very
91:29 - similar to one another so we can tackle
91:32 - these both at the same time a little bit
91:34 - now this part will be broken up over
91:36 - multiple lessons because there is a few
91:37 - things we need to do to sort of set the
91:39 - stage and make sure that we're on the
91:41 - right track so let's go and start things
91:42 - off here and we'll come over to my
91:44 - design system once again and now we are
91:46 - going to build in the quick navigation
91:48 - as well as our tabs over here so for the
91:51 - navigation typically you'll see
91:53 - something like this
91:54 - and you know we just have our nav with
91:56 - the ul we have our allies with our links
91:58 - inside of it and it usually is not
92:00 - anything too special we start with
92:02 - something that looks like that and there
92:03 - are a few things we can do before we
92:05 - even get into styling anything specific
92:07 - for the primary navigation we've already
92:09 - created a few utility classes we could
92:11 - use here just to sort of get things off
92:13 - in the right foot so why don't you go
92:14 - ahead and do that and use some of the
92:17 - classes we've already created to try and
92:18 - get this as far along as you can without
92:20 - writing any extra css
92:23 - all right so i hope you're starting to
92:25 - see the benefits of having these utility
92:27 - classes
92:28 - if it's something that is newer to you
92:29 - so we're going to come in here and give
92:31 - these a class and we'll do equals and
92:33 - there's a few different things that we
92:34 - can put on these first we'll do an upper
92:36 - case and we'll also follow this up with
92:39 - having a text white and let's go and
92:42 - take a look and that already looks a lot
92:43 - better let's just go and take a look
92:45 - here i'm pretty happy with already the
92:47 - progress that that gave us and there is
92:49 - one other class that we can give these
92:51 - and that is the letter spacing q these
92:55 - are not outlined or given to us in the
92:57 - design spec anywhere but if you look in
92:59 - the figma file or if you just look
93:01 - closely you might notice that we have
93:02 - those we can give that on all of those
93:04 - and it just spaces the letters out a
93:06 - little bit for us and there's one other
93:07 - one maybe you've already done this when
93:09 - we did this but we can come over here
93:10 - and add our flex class on there right
93:12 - away and we can see it also spaces
93:15 - things out a little bit
93:16 - now i'm not going to stress too much on
93:18 - the actual big spaces that we see here
93:21 - just because the finished design does
93:23 - have a smaller one but once again we
93:25 - could come on here and say that we have
93:26 - a style and do the gap and make this
93:29 - bigger say we do four rem instead and
93:32 - that's gonna add to the spaces maybe you
93:34 - want bigger you can come in with an 8
93:35 - ram or something like that and we can
93:37 - space things out more and more based on
93:40 - what we're putting here so that could be
93:42 - a way to get started with it and that's
93:44 - again one of the nice things with having
93:46 - that custom property here another option
93:48 - you could do instead of doing an inline
93:50 - style i've mentioned it but i haven't
93:51 - looked at it yet would be to over here
93:54 - we could actually create our primary
93:56 - navigation
93:57 - and on there we could come in and say
93:59 - the gap is a rem
94:01 - and that's going to have the exact same
94:03 - effect if we come back and take a look
94:05 - we can see the nice big spaces are there
94:07 - and if i knock that down to a one rem
94:09 - and we go and take a new look you can
94:11 - see that those spaces have gone down and
94:13 - it's much closer together so custom
94:16 - properties are amazing it is my big
94:18 - takeaway from that let's jump that back
94:20 - up to eight
94:22 - and of course there's a few other things
94:23 - that we need to do on this so we'll do a
94:25 - list style
94:26 - of none just so we don't have anything
94:28 - there and i will do a padding of zero at
94:32 - margin of zero just because it is a ul
94:34 - that we're placing all of this on and
94:36 - there's some default styling in there
94:37 - that i do want to get rid of so we can
94:39 - come and take a look and i think that's
94:40 - looking a little bit better
94:42 - now another thing we can do on our
94:43 - primary navigation is we can come in and
94:46 - say that we have our primary navigation
94:49 - and we can do our links that are in here
94:52 - and say that these links are a text
94:54 - declaration of none
94:56 - and this is our we're really in
94:58 - components here so i really don't see
95:00 - any issues with using descendant
95:02 - selectors like this where we're scoping
95:04 - the style of the link within a primary
95:06 - navigation and we're going to see more
95:08 - and more of this especially as we go
95:09 - into the tab system as well
95:11 - so we've done a nice job setting the
95:12 - stage there's one more thing i want to
95:14 - do before we worry about the underlines
95:16 - and that is adding those numbers in
95:17 - there
95:18 - because we did see you know we have the
95:20 - numbers here that we don't have down
95:21 - here and this is very similar to our
95:24 - numbered titles where i'm going to throw
95:26 - a span on this one and i'll do this
95:28 - really fast
95:30 - and there we go so i put a span on those
95:32 - and so with those there this is very
95:33 - similar to our numbered titles that
95:35 - we've created so i'll let you come in
95:37 - and add the styling on there that we
95:38 - need for them and then after that we'll
95:40 - look at adding those underlines
95:44 - all right so on there i'm going to come
95:45 - in with my primary navigation
95:48 - a
95:49 - and
95:50 - we could do the a and span like that
95:53 - we don't really need the direct
95:54 - descendant selector here but i'm going
95:56 - to do it anyway
95:57 - you could even come in like this but i
95:59 - just want to make sure if something
96:01 - weird were to happen maybe somehow a
96:03 - span gets put in that's not inside a
96:05 - link and i don't want this style to leak
96:07 - out necessarily so on here i'm just
96:09 - going to say the font weight
96:11 - is going to be 700 which is my bold
96:13 - weight and we're also going to add a
96:15 - little margin to the right side of like
96:17 - a 0.5
96:19 - m that let's go and take a look and see
96:21 - how that looks
96:24 - and if we come and compare that to here
96:26 - it is looking pretty good i just
96:28 - realized i put the wrong numbers but for
96:29 - this it doesn't matter too much uh but
96:31 - for now let's focus on putting those
96:33 - underlines in there before i challenge
96:35 - you the one thing i'm going to do is
96:37 - because
96:39 - these underlines are sharing between two
96:41 - different elements and this is why i've
96:42 - called this whole thing underlined
96:44 - indicators
96:45 - is
96:46 - because they have that in common we
96:48 - don't want to do double the work because
96:50 - we could style it up for our navigation
96:51 - and then we could style it up again for
96:53 - our tabs over here and i really don't
96:55 - want to be doing that so instead of
96:58 - worrying about right now our primary
96:59 - navigation what i'm going to do is come
97:02 - on the same place where we have our
97:03 - primary navigation and i'm going to call
97:05 - this underline ndk tours and you could
97:09 - do this instead of having it here as
97:11 - almost a utility class that is being
97:13 - placed on each one of the links i'm
97:15 - going to put it here to create sort of
97:17 - this grouping it's part of a bigger
97:18 - component and it's going to allow it to
97:21 - work in both places and just have to put
97:23 - the class in one place instead of
97:24 - multiple but there are different ways to
97:26 - skin a cat so i don't think there'd be
97:27 - anything wrong i would just take the s
97:29 - off so it's underline indicator and put
97:31 - it on each one of the links this just is
97:33 - a little bit less work to do it this way
97:35 - and so we can come in here we can create
97:37 - the dot underline in the k doors and if
97:41 - you think you're able to dive in and
97:43 - start doing it and getting it to look
97:45 - like this where we have a normal state
97:46 - the hover state and then active state
97:48 - here just be very careful it doesn't
97:50 - mean active with the active pseudo class
97:53 - this is active in a different way if
97:55 - you'd like a little more information
97:56 - wait in a second
97:57 - and i'll give some on there but if
97:58 - you're ready and you think you could
98:00 - style this up go for it right now don't
98:02 - worry about the background color here
98:03 - let's just worry about getting these
98:04 - underlines coming on and so let's go and
98:07 - i'll you know you can jump in there
98:08 - right away or if you'd like a hint you
98:10 - can wait a few seconds and i'll give you
98:11 - a hint and i'll be giving the solution
98:13 - to this in the next
98:14 - video all right so i do have two hints
98:17 - for it one of them is about that active
98:18 - class so that would be on my li here i'm
98:21 - actually going to put a little class of
98:23 - active just like that and that's going
98:26 - to allow me to sort of hook into here to
98:27 - add it
98:28 - it could also be placed on the link but
98:31 - in this case i much prefer it on the li
98:33 - just because it's going to make it a
98:35 - little bit easier to share this between
98:37 - here and ship and here so i'm going to
98:39 - do it in this way
98:41 - so that could help you just you know get
98:43 - in so the dot active is going to be
98:45 - styled a little bit differently and with
98:47 - that i'm going to once again give you
98:48 - the reins and let you go but if you
98:50 - start and you get stuck i do have one
98:52 - more hint to give you um which i'll be
98:54 - giving in a couple of seconds
98:58 - all right and the last hint is that we
99:00 - don't want to be styling
99:01 - on our underline indicators class itself
99:04 - because that is all of these and i'd
99:06 - much rather place it on each individual
99:08 - one of my lis so to do that we could
99:11 - come in and say li here and it would
99:13 - choose my allies but once again i want
99:15 - this to be more robust to be able to be
99:17 - used in different situations so i'm
99:19 - going to do this instead which means
99:21 - we're selecting every direct child or
99:24 - direct descendant of my underline
99:26 - indicators and just to show you if i
99:28 - throw a background of red on there it
99:30 - should come in let's just make sure that
99:32 - this is also saved and there we go we
99:34 - have the red coming in on all of those
99:36 - so hopefully with that you have enough
99:38 - information to get this going and start
99:41 - styling it up and i'll see you in the
99:43 - next lesson with my solution
99:47 - so very quickly for anyone who didn't
99:49 - watch the hints in the last one i am
99:50 - selecting all of the direct descendants
99:52 - rather than the lis here just so it's
99:55 - more reusable in different situations
99:57 - and we'll talk more about that when we
99:58 - get over to our tabs over here but let's
100:01 - get this all working for us now i don't
100:03 - actually want to style anything here
100:05 - directly but i'm going to do it now just
100:06 - so i can see it on the page and then
100:08 - we're going to transfer that over to the
100:09 - hover and our active and so i'm going to
100:12 - use a border for this and it's not often
100:13 - we use borders but i'm going to do a
100:15 - border bottom and if you did this with a
100:17 - pseudo element instead then you're a
100:18 - person of my heart
100:20 - because i love suit elements and my
100:21 - first initial thought for this was to
100:23 - use suit elements but in this case i'm
100:25 - going to come in with a border bottom of
100:27 - 0.2 ram solid and we can use our
100:31 - variable of our color light right here
100:34 - with with our hsl on the outside so it's
100:37 - actually working just so i can make sure
100:39 - that it's actually showing up so let's
100:40 - go take a look
100:43 - and there we go it's working except i
100:45 - chose the wrong color color white not
100:47 - color like and there we go we can see
100:49 - that it is underlined just like we
100:51 - needed to but obviously uh the spacing
100:54 - is a little bit off and the easiest way
100:56 - in my opinion to fix that is to just
100:58 - come in and on these right here give
101:01 - them some padding so i'll do padding and
101:03 - we'll do a one m on the top and the
101:05 - bottom and a zero on the left and the
101:07 - right i am adding the padding on the top
101:09 - and the bottom um as you'll notice here
101:12 - and we can actually play with this a
101:13 - little bit as you'll see in a second but
101:15 - let's leave it like that for now and we
101:17 - can see that's looking pretty good the
101:18 - spacing maybe is not quite big enough
101:20 - for this section but it might be even
101:22 - too big for when we do the tabs
101:24 - so because of that can you think of a
101:26 - way that we could sort of customize
101:28 - things a little bit depending on their
101:30 - situation so set a default and then to
101:32 - have something that could change that
101:34 - default depending on the situation
101:36 - something we've looked at a couple of
101:37 - times already if you can think of it go
101:39 - ahead and do that now and if you'd like
101:41 - a hint i'll give one in a second
101:43 - and that hint is custom properties are
101:45 - amazing and so if that gives you a
101:47 - little bit of a clue as to how to do it
101:49 - maybe you have to look up at some of the
101:51 - other ones we've already set some
101:52 - default custom properties to so then you
101:54 - can go and replace this number with that
101:56 - and i'll give you my solution in just a
101:58 - second
102:00 - all right great so let's come in and
102:02 - change this padding right here to be a
102:04 - custom property so we're going to do
102:06 - var and we'll just call this underline
102:08 - gap i don't want to call it gap because
102:10 - i want it to be something that is unique
102:12 - and we do this is one of those undefined
102:14 - local custom properties so i will come
102:16 - in and give a default value that we can
102:18 - overwrite really easily
102:20 - and so if we look that's looking pretty
102:21 - good but as we know our primary
102:24 - navigation actually needs a different
102:25 - one so i can keep my gap there and i can
102:27 - come and say my underline gap is let's
102:31 - do maybe two rem in this case and
102:34 - because this is on the padding it will
102:35 - affect the padding top and bottom so
102:38 - there we go we have the bigger space
102:40 - just like we see in the design here
102:41 - where it's a much bigger space and
102:43 - that's going to give us the padding on
102:44 - the top here as well which is going to
102:46 - be very handy because that's going to
102:47 - sort of set the stage for this
102:49 - background that we'll be bringing in
102:51 - once we get to the actual pages because
102:53 - there's some interesting things with
102:54 - that background that we're going to have
102:55 - to do
102:56 - so i know that everything is looking
102:58 - good and what i'm actually going to do
103:00 - is change the opacity on here to be zero
103:03 - because then just by setting it up there
103:05 - and you don't have to do it this way if
103:07 - you just change the border bottom each
103:09 - time that would work perfectly fine but
103:11 - i'm just going to set the color to zero
103:13 - and then what we can do is say that my
103:15 - underline indicators
103:18 - cover
103:20 - and we can come in with the uh we don't
103:22 - need the whole border bottom actually
103:24 - all we need to do now is our border
103:26 - color and we can change that and say
103:28 - it's our hsl with our color white once
103:31 - again but come in with a bit of opacity
103:33 - on it
103:34 - and if we have a hover before i forget
103:36 - we should also have a focus state so we
103:39 - can come in and bring this right here
103:41 - with our focus as well
103:43 - and then we can also come in and i'll
103:46 - just copy this actually
103:49 - paste right there and instead of having
103:52 - all this we can just come in and say a
103:54 - dot active and if you left the star
103:56 - there he said start on active but we
103:57 - don't really need it so we're going to
103:58 - say that a dot active that is a direct
104:02 - descendant of our underlying indicator
104:04 - will come in and get this white with the
104:06 - solid one here and let's go and take a
104:08 - look at how that's looking so my active
104:11 - is perfect let's see
104:13 - hover is also working and there we go
104:15 - that's looking pretty great to me
104:17 - i think the underline is actually
104:19 - supposed to be a bit more and checking
104:20 - the figma file it is so i'm going to
104:21 - boost that up to a 0.5 instead of a 0.25
104:24 - and there we go really really cool works
104:27 - really well the hover doesn't change on
104:29 - this one because the active here is
104:31 - overriding it and i think that is pretty
104:33 - awesome so in the next video we're going
104:35 - to look at how we can come in and get
104:38 - this tab component to come in instead
104:39 - and just get the same functionality in
104:41 - there and it should be easy breezy
104:43 - because we've already set up the
104:44 - component though there will be a few
104:46 - little tweaks and extra styling we'll
104:47 - have to do not so much on this one but
104:50 - just for the tabs themselves
104:55 - all right so we finished this one here
104:56 - with our underline indicators and we're
104:58 - going to come in and create some tab a
104:59 - similar tab system just to show you how
105:01 - easy it is to move things around and i'm
105:03 - going to be asking you to do most of the
105:05 - work here but i'm going to do set the
105:06 - stage a little bit and we're going to
105:08 - have a div class there and actually i'll
105:09 - leave that empty
105:11 - and we'll do a closed div and in here
105:13 - instead of using a list we're just going
105:15 - to be coming in with buttons because
105:17 - this will be an interactive section
105:18 - we're going to be doing
105:19 - and so we're going to have a button and
105:21 - there are several important things that
105:23 - are actually going to come up when we
105:24 - add the functionality here when it also
105:25 - comes to accessibility for this type of
105:27 - system but for now i'm only worried
105:29 - about the styling of it
105:31 - we can have our three buttons if we go
105:32 - and actually take a look at that we have
105:34 - these three buttons that are showing up
105:36 - and there there's nothing in them and in
105:38 - here right away we can add our text we
105:40 - can do our moon we can have our text
105:43 - right here of mars and we can do our
105:45 - text of europa
105:47 - and i think i've done a lot of what we
105:49 - need for you to actually be able to
105:51 - style this up and make it look the way
105:53 - we need it to so why don't you take what
105:55 - we've learned so far we'll have to add
105:57 - utility classes to a few different
105:58 - places here and maybe make a few extra
106:01 - tweaks so i'll let you do your best we
106:03 - might have to create a new class as well
106:05 - just as a little hint and i'll leave it
106:07 - to you to do your best on it and then
106:08 - i'll come in with my own solution very
106:10 - shortly
106:12 - all right so i hope you had some success
106:14 - and if you ran into any problems
106:15 - hopefully we can address what those
106:17 - might be
106:17 - so the first thing i'm actually going to
106:19 - do is on all these buttons here let's
106:21 - come in on these with a class is equal
106:23 - to and what do we need we need them to
106:25 - be
106:26 - uppercase
106:27 - we need them to be text
106:29 - and i'm actually going to do this on all
106:31 - of them and you'll see we'll sort of
106:33 - tweak things a little bit
106:34 - because i think it'll make life easier
106:36 - so on all of them i'm going to do the
106:38 - text accent and if you change that for
106:40 - the moon button because the moon one
106:41 - should be white whereas the other ones
106:42 - have the accent color perfectly fine and
106:45 - i'll just talk about in a minute why i'm
106:47 - making this difference
106:48 - or why i'm including it on all three i
106:50 - should say so we can have the text
106:51 - accent that's on all of those we also
106:53 - have some letter spacing so we can do
106:55 - our letter spacing too just like in the
106:58 - navigation it's the same letter spacing
107:00 - another thing we could do since we're
107:02 - here and we do need to set a background
107:04 - on them anyway to get rid of the default
107:05 - background so if you did a bg dark here
107:07 - that'd be fantastic we have the borders
107:09 - that are really ugly but at least the
107:10 - rest of it is working and the last thing
107:13 - we need to do is our font family so
107:15 - let's come right here on these and do
107:18 - our font family
107:19 - songs condensed and they're pretty much
107:23 - there but we need those underlying
107:25 - indicators
107:26 - ah that shouldn't be too hard we can
107:27 - come up to here and say underline
107:30 - indicator and we did a lot of work on
107:32 - that don't forget the s and it's sort of
107:35 - working though there's some weird border
107:36 - stuff going on with it so i hope that
107:38 - didn't trip you up too much
107:39 - uh and there's two other things that i
107:41 - can think of doing before we leave is
107:43 - even though they're next to one another
107:44 - we need some more spacing on them and we
107:46 - saw that we can add spacing quite easily
107:48 - by using a flex class and there we've
107:51 - got a bit of spacing and maybe we want
107:52 - to tweak that with the gap property that
107:55 - we can play with or that custom property
107:57 - that we have why don't we start there
107:58 - and one of the easy ways to do that is
108:00 - i'm going to call this my tab
108:03 - list as its own class just like up here
108:05 - we had our primary navigation and our
108:07 - underline indicators here i'm going to
108:09 - have my underlying indicators but also a
108:10 - tab list just because this does need a
108:13 - little bit of custom styling on it
108:16 - you could say could our underlying
108:17 - indicators set the stage for both of
108:20 - these and 100 we could definitely make
108:22 - that a little bit more robust by coming
108:24 - in and let's go find that
108:26 - um when we set our border bottom here we
108:28 - could come in first and say that there's
108:30 - a border of zero and that just means it
108:32 - doesn't matter if there wasn't one like
108:34 - with our links but if there was a border
108:36 - it would actually eliminate those right
108:37 - away and look at that it's already
108:39 - looking much much better um another
108:41 - thing that we could probably do on this
108:43 - is the cursor because on this it was
108:45 - links and we're getting the hand cursor
108:47 - and i realize you can't see it now while
108:48 - i'm doing this because the scrimba icon
108:50 - is the same but i'm getting a hand icon
108:52 - here and i'm getting the regular arrow
108:54 - on those so why don't we come in on here
108:56 - and also say that we have a cursor of
108:58 - pointer which just because of how i like
109:01 - to organize my css i'm going to move up
109:03 - to right here
109:04 - and again this is just making things
109:06 - more robust whether it's a link or
109:07 - whether it's a button so they will work
109:10 - no matter what and there we go that's
109:11 - working pretty good
109:13 - now i did add my tab list so we can come
109:15 - down and say that we have our tab list
109:17 - and in here i can change my gap so let's
109:19 - make it maybe three rem and if we go
109:21 - take a look there we go we have a better
109:22 - spacing on those maybe 2.5 would
109:25 - actually be or a 2 or 2.5 would actually
109:27 - be right in the ball house of what we
109:29 - need so that's looking pretty good and
109:31 - last but not least we do need to have
109:34 - the active one and i'm almost guaranteed
109:37 - use an active class when you did this
109:39 - which is perfectly fine and it works and
109:40 - it's what i've taught you to do and what
109:42 - you probably assumed would be the
109:43 - solution
109:44 - i am going to do things a little bit
109:46 - different for this one just because i
109:48 - was talking about accessibility
109:51 - um so i do want to come in on these guys
109:53 - right here and instead of using the
109:56 - active class i'm actually going to come
109:58 - on this first button and i'm going to
110:00 - write area selected
110:02 - is equal to true
110:04 - and we're going to take the same thing
110:05 - and we're going to put it on our other
110:06 - buttons
110:08 - but we're going to switch them to false
110:09 - and
110:10 - if you don't know what an area is it
110:13 - stands for accessible rich internet
110:15 - applications and basically it's
110:17 - something that we can use to give extra
110:19 - context once again to assistive
110:21 - technologies and because we're going to
110:23 - be turning this into a tab system it's a
110:26 - way to let them know that this is
110:28 - actually the selected tab that's very
110:30 - different than links because when you go
110:31 - to a different page we're going to have
110:33 - to manually move this class one to the
110:34 - next when we click on a link we're going
110:36 - to literally another html page whereas
110:39 - here we're staying on the same page and
110:41 - we're changing content around and we're
110:43 - going to have tabs that are related to
110:46 - each one of these buttons and this is
110:48 - going to let the assistive technology
110:50 - know which one of the tabs is actually
110:53 - open we're gonna have more area stuff
110:55 - that's gonna be coming into here area is
110:57 - something that can seem overwhelming if
110:59 - you first start getting into it because
111:00 - there's so many different properties but
111:02 - in general if you're using semantic html
111:05 - you don't need to worry about it too
111:07 - much but for something like a tab list
111:09 - it is going to really help us out and
111:11 - one way that we can sort of try and
111:13 - enforce people using these types of
111:15 - things is to come in and here we have
111:17 - our active another way that we could do
111:19 - the same thing is with our underlying
111:22 - indicators
111:24 - we could say that anything that has the
111:27 - attribute here you can actually put
111:28 - attribute selectors so anything with an
111:31 - area selected equals true and now if we
111:33 - go and take a look we can see it's added
111:36 - that underneath because that's the area
111:37 - selected equals true the one issue is
111:40 - obviously the text color so we can also
111:42 - come in and say that
111:44 - we can change the color of the entire
111:46 - thing as well so then the color will
111:48 - also become this one right here
111:51 - and paste that so it's the same in both
111:53 - spots and then the selected one will be
111:55 - white and then we can you know we have
111:57 - the hover effect once we add the
111:58 - functionality to this when we click on
112:00 - this it will switch which one is the
112:02 - area selected and the styling of it will
112:04 - update along with what we've done here
112:06 - so there we go that is our tabs nice and
112:09 - done
112:12 - all right so we're moving on into our
112:13 - dot indicators now which are these guys
112:16 - right here and there's really nothing
112:18 - too much complex or nothing new about
112:20 - these other than one little thing that i
112:22 - want to look at with you before i give
112:24 - you the challenge of completing them and
112:26 - that is if we come and we're going to
112:28 - jump over here and they're actually very
112:30 - very similar to our tab list right here
112:33 - so i'm actually going to copy that and
112:34 - paste it in
112:36 - but we obviously will change this over
112:38 - from a tab list to dot nbk tours and i
112:41 - think leaving the flex on here makes
112:43 - sense because it'll give us extra
112:44 - control on spacing them if we need that
112:47 - and then in here we don't really need
112:48 - these classes on here i don't think so
112:50 - let's get rid of these for you just to
112:51 - speed things up for when i give you the
112:53 - challenge
112:54 - and we get rid of that that and that and
112:56 - we want to keep these areas selected
112:58 - because it's going to work very similar
112:59 - to how our tabs are going to work and
113:01 - that when we switch between them we want
113:03 - them
113:04 - we're going to be switching between
113:05 - different tabs effectively just with a
113:07 - different type of visual indicator to
113:09 - show us what's happening but the problem
113:11 - is we're saying area selected equals
113:12 - true but then if we take the text out
113:14 - and we hit save and let's go and there
113:16 - they are and actually let's do one thing
113:18 - really really fast here uh on this div
113:21 - i'm going to come in with a class is
113:23 - equal to flow
113:24 - and then here in my style let's just say
113:26 - that my
113:28 - uh
113:29 - flow space
113:31 - is for ram or something like that just
113:33 - add the extra spacing so we can see
113:35 - those are the dot indicators right there
113:37 - and so
113:38 - this is where they're going to be but
113:39 - there's no context right so it knows the
113:41 - screenwriter will know which one is
113:43 - selected but it doesn't know what is
113:44 - actually selected if it's reading this
113:46 - out loud it's going to read button
113:48 - button button and it doesn't there's no
113:50 - context to what the buttons are or what
113:52 - the buttons are doing whereas this is
113:54 - our slide title or our tab title i'll
113:57 - put slide title but it's really a tab
113:58 - title uh but i've already started
114:00 - writing so there's no going back now
114:02 - slide title and
114:04 - now we have context for what they are
114:06 - just like here we know it's our moon our
114:08 - mars and our europa
114:10 - but we don't want that text there
114:11 - because visually this is what we need
114:13 - where we just want these visual icons
114:15 - instead
114:17 - but there is a solution to this and what
114:19 - we can do is come in on all of these and
114:21 - add a span
114:23 - class is equal to and this is something
114:24 - we created a long time ago and we
114:26 - haven't used yet our sr only which is
114:29 - short for screen reader only
114:32 - and there's other ways of adding context
114:34 - like this but i'm going to do it like
114:35 - this in this situation where now you can
114:37 - actually see it's hidden away the text
114:39 - that was in there
114:40 - and that's perfect it's exactly what we
114:42 - wanted and what this basically is if we
114:44 - go and find that in our css it's doing a
114:47 - whole bunch of things here to visually
114:49 - hide whatever is
114:51 - inside this class so those spans they're
114:54 - just hidden away they're not going to be
114:55 - visually seen but when an assistive
114:58 - technology like a screen reader gets to
114:59 - this and is reading out things it will
115:01 - read this and it gives the button
115:03 - context to what happens if the person
115:05 - happens to click and select that slide
115:08 - so we're just helping a bit with the
115:10 - accessibility and again we're going to
115:11 - be going deeper in as we make these
115:13 - functional but for now we're worried
115:15 - more about the visuals and we sort of
115:17 - have some ugly buttons
115:18 - that we want to turn into those little
115:20 - circle buttons so i'm going to come all
115:22 - the way down here and i'm just going to
115:24 - let you do it it's a little bit simpler
115:26 - i think than some of the other ones
115:27 - we've done so far i don't think you need
115:29 - a helping hand based on everything we've
115:31 - looked at so give it your best shot and
115:33 - in a few seconds i will give you my
115:34 - solution
115:37 - all right so just like before we have
115:39 - our dot indicators
115:41 - and we don't want to actually do
115:42 - anything on the dot indicators we want
115:44 - to select all of the direct children
115:46 - that are inside and there's a few things
115:49 - i'm going to do the cursor pointer once
115:51 - again so we have a nice pointer on there
115:53 - i'm going to come in with a border that
115:56 - is zero
115:57 - and we're going to throw in right away a
115:59 - border radius of 50
116:00 - to make them nice perfect circles and
116:03 - hopefully it makes some perfect circles
116:04 - but we might go and look and find out oh
116:06 - they're just really flat now
116:08 - that's not what we want how could we fix
116:10 - that this is something we've looked at
116:12 - before how can we make a nice perfect
116:14 - square or circle in this case because we
116:16 - already have our border radius on there
116:17 - without setting a width and a height
116:21 - hopefully you said that we could set an
116:23 - aspect ratio of one so it's one over one
116:26 - which we can make just into one like
116:27 - that and by doing that we go and take a
116:29 - look look at that perfect little circles
116:31 - right there uh they do need to be a
116:33 - little bit bigger than that so why don't
116:35 - we just add a touch of padding so we can
116:37 - do padding of like .25
116:39 - uh m or rem would probably be fine you
116:42 - know what that made them too small let's
116:44 - try 8.5 instead and go take a look and
116:46 - that's more in line with the actual size
116:48 - that we want on them and of course we
116:50 - need the now set the colors so we have
116:53 - very faded medium faded and not faded at
116:56 - all so we can come in and set first a
116:59 - background color background color right
117:01 - there and i'll do my hsl and choose the
117:04 - 0.25 as my starting point and then what
117:08 - i'm actually going to do just to speed
117:09 - things up let's copy that paste it and
117:11 - make this my hover
117:14 - and of course with my hover we also want
117:17 - to have a focus we're actually going to
117:18 - change the focus to something different
117:20 - a little bit later but
117:22 - we'll talk about that once we make it
117:23 - functional because that's where we'll
117:24 - see why we want to change it for this
117:26 - one the only thing we need to do is come
117:28 - in and change the color 2.5
117:31 - and then we can also take advantage of
117:34 - this type of selector right here you
117:36 - know what let's just copy all that
117:40 - and change this over to our dot
117:42 - indicator with an area selected is true
117:45 - and in that case the background color
117:48 - will be our pure white and let's go and
117:50 - take a look and i think that's looking
117:53 - pretty good and there we go we get our
117:54 - hover seat that's looking good we have
117:56 - the active state that's looking good and
117:59 - i think i'm pretty happy with that i
118:01 - hope you are too and i'll see you in the
118:03 - next lesson
118:07 - so it's time for the last interactive
118:09 - element which is our numbered indicators
118:11 - and you before you started this you
118:12 - might have noticed that this lesson is
118:14 - actually a lot shorter than pretty much
118:15 - all the other ones we've done so far
118:17 - and that's because i'm not helping you
118:20 - with this one i'm leaving this one
118:21 - completely up to you i'm not providing
118:23 - any solutions i think you've learned
118:25 - enough along the way and yeah you've
118:27 - reached a point where you you know what
118:28 - to do here you don't need my help
118:29 - anymore you can pull this off all on
118:31 - your own and this is one of those things
118:33 - that's really important i've mentioned
118:35 - it before i've been challenging you
118:36 - throughout but i want to leave certain
118:39 - things in this not actually done to give
118:42 - you a real initiative to take them on
118:44 - and to try them because up until now if
118:46 - you were stuck you'd be able to just
118:48 - watch my solution a few seconds later or
118:50 - in the next lesson and
118:52 - at one point you need to take those
118:54 - training wheels off and put into
118:56 - practice what you're learning and maybe
118:57 - you haven't been doing the challenges
118:59 - knowing that i was coming up with the
119:00 - solutions and it's very different to
119:02 - watch someone else do it and to
119:04 - understand what they're doing and i'm
119:06 - sure you've done this before you've
119:07 - watched tutorials you've understood what
119:08 - they're doing and then you go to do
119:10 - something similar yourself a week later
119:12 - and you just have no idea where to start
119:14 - so it's really important we've done a
119:16 - lot of things there's a lot of
119:17 - similarities there's a few little things
119:19 - that are going to be different here and
119:20 - i want you to take what you've learned
119:22 - throughout all of this and put it into
119:24 - practice and if you get stuck along the
119:25 - way refer back to those previous lessons
119:28 - where you might remember i know kevin
119:29 - covered this i just don't remember
119:31 - exactly how to do it and then you can
119:33 - come and fix whatever you were stuck on
119:34 - and keep going forward until you're done
119:36 - because that's what's really going to
119:38 - reinforce everything that you're
119:39 - learning here you're in probably the
119:40 - most interactive way to learn code you
119:42 - just have to you know
119:44 - come in pause the video and start typing
119:46 - stuff take advantage of that and do as
119:48 - much coding as you can so yeah i'm not
119:51 - giving you a solution i'm leaving this
119:52 - one completely up to you i'll give you a
119:54 - little helping hand just by going over
119:56 - to here putting the indicator right here
119:58 - where you need to start and take as much
120:00 - time as you need with it don't feel
120:02 - rushed because i know you're going to be
120:03 - excited to get to the next lesson where
120:06 - we're going to be starting to get into
120:07 - the actual design the actual pages and
120:10 - making things come to life but please do
120:12 - take the time to complete this first and
120:14 - then i will see you in that next lesson
120:15 - when you're ready
120:19 - so we've finished working on our design
120:20 - system and now it is time to start
120:22 - working on the actual content of the
120:23 - pages and before we dive into writing
120:26 - some code i just want to look quickly at
120:27 - what we're starting with from friend and
120:29 - mentor because they do give us some
120:31 - resources to be starting with so first
120:33 - of all we do have the design of all the
120:35 - pages that we're going to be creating
120:36 - which we've already been using our
120:38 - design system fork we have our homepage
120:40 - we have a destination page we also have
120:43 - our crew page that we're going to have
120:44 - to build as well as a technology page
120:47 - and there's different ways that we might
120:49 - approach this and this is where you need
120:51 - to make some choices in how you're going
120:53 - to do that and this is just a screenshot
120:55 - we can see all the files are here as
120:57 - well
120:58 - in this scrim and if you download the
121:00 - files from front-end mentor this is in
121:03 - the starter code section where we have a
121:06 - lot of html files and this is where
121:08 - you're going to have to make a decision
121:10 - based on where your experience level is
121:12 - at with html css javascript any
121:16 - frameworks you might be using and all of
121:17 - that because if we look here we have all
121:19 - of these crew pages right here we have
121:21 - all these destination pages right here
121:23 - and we have all these technology pages
121:25 - that are right there and you might be
121:27 - going why do i have all of those and
121:29 - that's because when we're on any given
121:32 - one of those designs let's rewind just a
121:34 - second and if i look at this on my
121:36 - technologies one we have three pages
121:37 - because there's three different slides
121:39 - here so they're providing us the content
121:41 - for each one of those as a separate page
121:44 - and if you're newer in your front-end
121:45 - journey you might decide to take this on
121:48 - as actual links when you click one of
121:50 - these it just goes to another html page
121:52 - and then this one goes to another html
121:53 - page they're links they're not buttons
121:56 - and that's completely fine that's
121:57 - perfect you could do the same thing on
121:59 - our uh crew page you could do the same
122:01 - thing on this where each tab is actually
122:03 - just a different link that brings you to
122:05 - a new page if you're more comfortable
122:07 - with javascript then you can add some
122:08 - javascript functionality with just one
122:10 - page where we're changing the content or
122:12 - if you're further along in your journey
122:13 - what you might want to use is actually
122:15 - the data.json file which is right here
122:17 - and we can take a look at that where all
122:19 - of the information for all of the pages
122:21 - is available here as a json file so you
122:24 - could actually populate all the content
122:26 - using this instead of having to copy
122:28 - paste and have a whole bunch of divs and
122:30 - everything and add a bit of
122:31 - interactivity that way where you're
122:33 - pulling the information from here for
122:36 - this because i want it to be a little
122:37 - more vanilla in terms we're just gonna
122:39 - be using regular javascript and also
122:41 - because i'm targeting more of an
122:42 - intermediate level we're gonna find the
122:44 - middle ground i'm not going to have all
122:46 - of these pages here i'm only going to be
122:48 - having one page for technology one page
122:50 - for destination and one page for crew
122:53 - and i'm gonna have all the content on
122:54 - that page and just create a tab system
122:56 - using javascript to make it a little
122:58 - interactive so it's not pulling the
123:00 - information from here it's not going to
123:02 - be static individual pages for all of
123:04 - them it's a middle ground but based on
123:06 - your skill level if you want to
123:07 - challenge yourself and pull ahead of me
123:08 - which i really encourage that you do at
123:10 - this stage you can choose whichever
123:12 - direction you want to go in for these
123:14 - now if you and if you are going that
123:16 - route we can see that if you go in the
123:17 - destination all the content is here but
123:19 - there's no markup or anything so you are
123:20 - going to be writing your own html to
123:22 - actually organize the content that we
123:24 - can see in each one of these so that is
123:26 - an important thing to know and we are
123:27 - going to be starting with our index
123:28 - right here which is our homepage and for
123:30 - this one we don't have to worry too much
123:31 - because there's no different tabs or
123:34 - systems like that it's sort of the
123:35 - simplest page but at the same time we
123:37 - will have to do a bit more work to get
123:38 - our navigation working
123:40 - so at this stage we have a design system
123:42 - in place if you feel ready to start
123:43 - taking what we've done and applying it
123:45 - you can go ahead and do that or if you'd
123:47 - rather you could work with me as we go
123:50 - through the home page here see how i do
123:52 - it a little bit i'll be starting mobile
123:53 - first we'll get the whole homepage
123:54 - working the navigation the mobile
123:56 - version as well as the large version of
123:58 - it working and then from there we're
124:00 - going to work our way into the other
124:02 - pages so you can always see how i do
124:04 - this first page and then take what
124:05 - you've learned from here to push ahead
124:06 - of me to finish off the other pages
124:09 - before i look at my solutions for them
124:14 - all right so it's time to start our work
124:15 - on the homepage and i'm really excited
124:17 - for that and here is the design that we
124:19 - are going to be focused on
124:21 - we will have to do a little bit more
124:22 - work for the navigation to finally get
124:24 - things working here but we will be
124:25 - breaking this page up over multiple
124:27 - lessons we can focus on the mobile
124:30 - version as well as the large version of
124:32 - the navigation as we run through on this
124:34 - but before we write any markup let's
124:35 - look at what we're actually starting
124:36 - with here so we have some html that's
124:38 - done for us we have our head that has
124:40 - the meta viewport which is very
124:42 - important because this means that our
124:43 - media queries will work on mobile
124:45 - devices so that's always a good one and
124:47 - we have a favicon here that's being
124:49 - brought in and a title so we're missing
124:51 - the link to our css file and we're also
124:53 - missing the link to the google fonts
124:55 - we've already got those set up in the
124:57 - design system so we might as well steal
124:59 - them from there so we can just grab this
125:01 - right here and i'll take that comment
125:03 - with it
125:03 - go back to my index and let's go right
125:06 - here and paste them in
125:08 - we have my google fonts that's awesome
125:10 - and then here we might as well put
125:11 - another comment just saying that this is
125:14 - our
125:15 - custom css
125:17 - and we have our css coming let's hit
125:19 - save cross our fingers c and yes we did
125:21 - something right we already got a win we
125:23 - can see the colors and the fonts are
125:25 - coming through so that is awesome
125:28 - all right so the next stage is to start
125:30 - writing our html for this and
125:33 - one thing that people ask me a lot is
125:35 - mobile first or desktop first when i
125:37 - style i style based on mobile first but
125:40 - when i'm writing html i focus on the
125:43 - desktop first and the reason that i do
125:45 - that is because this is where the most
125:47 - complexity in the layout is if i focused
125:49 - on this everything's stacking i don't
125:51 - really need to do anything it just it
125:53 - will stack automatically so i will focus
125:55 - on this while i'm writing my html and
125:58 - i'll be using as many of the utility
125:59 - classes as i have already along the way
126:02 - and just really quickly for the images
126:04 - and all that they are in the assets
126:05 - folder you're going to see that there's
126:07 - different versions for each one of the
126:08 - pages and some of the images like our
126:11 - background we actually have multiple
126:12 - versions of which i'll be talking more
126:14 - about once we start styling things up at
126:16 - this stage though i do think that you're
126:18 - ready to start going and remember we
126:19 - have some of these things or at least
126:20 - this already done sort of in our design
126:24 - system so don't feel shy about going to
126:26 - copy and paste it from there and if you
126:27 - haven't already gone ahead and started
126:29 - trying this out on your own just come in
126:31 - and see if you can figure out what tags
126:33 - you'd be using where what utility
126:35 - classes that we've already set up and
126:36 - then i'll go through this and give you
126:38 - my own solution to it
126:41 - all right so what i'm going to do is i'm
126:42 - going to start up here and i'm going to
126:44 - create a header and i'm going to give
126:45 - this a class and we might need more
126:46 - classes on here but i'm going to call it
126:48 - primary header for now and this isn't
126:50 - saying that there will be secondary
126:51 - headers or any other headers but the
126:53 - header is an element that you can have
126:55 - multiple on a page this could be if you
126:56 - have sections or articles within a page
126:58 - that need a header so i do like giving a
127:00 - class that i could hook into just in
127:03 - case and again sites can grow and
127:04 - different things can happen and if you
127:06 - style everything on the header element
127:07 - it could potentially run into conflicts
127:09 - down the road
127:11 - then in here i'm going to put a div that
127:13 - is going to be used close div
127:16 - this div is going to be used for my logo
127:18 - and then we can put our navigation which
127:21 - we already had so let's go and grab that
127:23 - because as i said we've already done the
127:24 - hard work on creating a navigation so
127:26 - why do the hard work twice
127:29 - nav close nav it has our classes already
127:32 - on there everything we need so i can
127:33 - just come here and i can paste it in
127:37 - there are a few little things that we
127:38 - will have to change first let's just fix
127:40 - my tabs so things are sorted out a
127:42 - little bit better and obviously the
127:44 - names here need to be updated and we
127:45 - need a new one so i'll do that really
127:47 - quickly
127:48 - and there we go i can delete this and
127:50 - let's hit save and just see there we go
127:51 - look at that we have a navigation it's
127:53 - not going to go anywhere yet but at
127:54 - least it is working and we already have
127:56 - our index we can do an index.html here
127:59 - we know this one is going to go to my
128:00 - destination.html
128:03 - and there we go i have that set up and
128:05 - ready to go now as i mentioned this div
128:07 - i'm going to be using for my logo and
128:09 - the reason i put a div here instead of
128:11 - just putting an image is we are also we
128:14 - need flex on this because both in this
128:16 - version and in this version we always
128:18 - have two columns that are popping up
128:20 - here and if an image is a flex item
128:22 - there are some bugs that can come up
128:23 - with that that are well known um
128:25 - especially within chromium and pretty
128:27 - much all of that gets fixed if they're
128:28 - inside a div because the div is the flex
128:31 - item and then the image can just be a
128:32 - normal image so here i'll come in with
128:35 - my image src is going to be equal to
128:38 - we want to go to our assets and from our
128:40 - assets it is in shared and then we have
128:44 - logo.svg
128:45 - and i will give that alt is equal to
128:48 - space tourism logo
128:50 - and i'm also going to come and give that
128:52 - a class of logo just in case and we
128:54 - probably will need to add some styles to
128:56 - that just to control it a little bit
128:57 - better so let's hit save and go and
128:59 - there we go we have a logo now so it's
129:01 - not perfect yet but let's come in and
129:03 - give a flex here on the entire header so
129:05 - we have one child here and my nav is the
129:07 - other child here so the flex will make
129:09 - each one into a column and said save
129:11 - there we go they're next to one another
129:13 - it's not perfect but at least we're on
129:15 - the right track and actually realizing
129:18 - now when i set this up one thing that i
129:19 - missed from the design system is all of
129:22 - these should also have been the
129:24 - condensed font so we can come and add
129:25 - that in now which would be font family
129:27 - songs condensed
129:29 - and there we go that's looking a little
129:31 - bit more like the actual one so i
129:33 - realize the alignment's not perfect
129:34 - positioning is not perfect but i just
129:36 - want to use what we already have so
129:38 - let's go and look now we've got that
129:41 - done we want to come down to here
129:43 - and one thing we had created was a
129:45 - container class
129:46 - and just as a little heads up we will
129:48 - actually be changing what the container
129:50 - is doing but i want to leave it like
129:52 - this for now and then we'll come back
129:53 - and modify it a little bit later and how
129:55 - it's working not just in the size we're
129:57 - going to take a little bit of a
129:58 - different approach on what the container
130:00 - does but now at least we're holding our
130:02 - content in the middle of the page and
130:04 - that's working pretty well i can't get
130:06 - big enough on my small screen right now
130:08 - but if we could get bigger it would
130:10 - leave us some space on the sides there
130:12 - so the next thing that we can do now
130:14 - that that's all in our container is we
130:16 - have all of our text and this is right
130:18 - away a really good look at why i wanted
130:20 - classes for our typography rather than
130:22 - setting things up because so you want to
130:24 - travel to space to me is the h1 and we
130:28 - have two different styles that are
130:29 - coming in on there so what i'm going to
130:31 - do is take this entire thing and we're
130:33 - going to open our h1 here
130:36 - and we're going to close our h1 down
130:38 - here
130:39 - and so you want to travel too and we can
130:41 - throw a span on this one right here and
130:43 - we can close our span because it is one
130:46 - sentence this is not a heading five
130:49 - followed by and heading one of space the
130:51 - h1 should be the title of your page so
130:54 - you want to travel to space is one
130:57 - sentence that all goes together and it's
130:58 - just a visual difference for people that
131:00 - are visiting it so what we can do now is
131:02 - so you want to travel to space on my h1
131:05 - we have some utility classes we can use
131:07 - so the color on there is my accent color
131:08 - so we can use text accent we have my
131:10 - font size and the font family size
131:13 - condensed as well as having the upper
131:15 - case
131:17 - and hit save it's looking good except
131:19 - obviously space needs to be changed a
131:21 - little bit right here so on space we can
131:24 - come here and give this a class is equal
131:26 - to and that would be my font size 900 my
131:28 - font family
131:30 - serif
131:31 - and my text white
131:33 - hit save and look at that we're getting
131:36 - there i know it's not on its own line
131:37 - and i'm not too stressed about that
131:38 - right now but look at the progress we've
131:40 - already started to make uh the last
131:42 - thing i just realized that we missed
131:44 - here would be my letter spacing so on
131:46 - here
131:47 - i'll do the letter spacing at the end
131:48 - letter spacing
131:52 - one just there we go now we're really
131:55 - rocking and rolling so now we can jump
131:57 - down into this paragraph that is down
131:59 - here and if we go and take a look to me
132:01 - that's just one big paragraph that we
132:03 - have so that's nice and simple we can
132:05 - just throw a p and close our paragraph
132:08 - right here and we shouldn't actually
132:10 - have to do anything else on that that i
132:12 - can think of so i'm going to leave that
132:13 - just like that so let's style this
132:15 - explore button and we'll look at that
132:17 - we've already done all that we don't
132:18 - have to do it again so we can go to our
132:19 - design system and right here we have my
132:22 - explore button so i can just copy that
132:24 - come back on over to here and paste that
132:27 - in and hit save and we get this giant
132:29 - explore button that's coming up and
132:31 - maybe going what's happening here why is
132:33 - my explorer it's working it's just if
132:34 - the browser is larger it's exploding and
132:37 - getting really big and it's an
132:38 - interesting reason why that happens so
132:40 - let's go to our css and look at what
132:41 - might have caused that it has to do with
132:43 - our display of grid
132:45 - large button we did a display grid so we
132:47 - could easily center the text in the
132:49 - middle of it
132:50 - the problem with this is when you do a
132:52 - display of grid it's actually making it
132:54 - into a the grid is an inner display
132:57 - value and the outer display value
132:59 - becomes block and because it's a block
133:01 - level element it's just growing to fit
133:02 - the page automatically
133:04 - i think however i'm going to end up
133:06 - setting this up in this two column
133:07 - section like this it's not really going
133:10 - to change too much along the way so what
133:12 - we can actually do to fix that is to
133:13 - come on here and actually say it's an
133:14 - inline grid and then it means it won't
133:17 - automatically expand to take up as much
133:18 - space as it can because it's more of an
133:20 - inline element on the outside and a grid
133:22 - element on the inside
133:24 - and even with how we're going to set
133:26 - this up i don't think it would be an
133:28 - issue but i will leave it like this for
133:30 - now because that does the job that we
133:32 - need it to and it could be good if ever
133:34 - we have to use it in a different place
133:39 - all right so our homepage it's not
133:40 - amazing but it's getting there and the
133:42 - next part i'm going to do is to fix the
133:44 - layout on here
133:45 - and then after we do the layout we can
133:47 - do a few little tiny touches before we
133:49 - get to the navigation itself so
133:52 - there's a few things let's first jump on
133:54 - over to my back to the index here
133:56 - because we're going to need a couple of
133:57 - things that are different
133:59 - one of them is on the body here i'm i'm
134:01 - going to give this a class it's equal to
134:03 - home
134:04 - because we do need to set background
134:05 - images on these pages and this is going
134:07 - to be one way that it opens the door for
134:09 - those
134:10 - another thing that we're going to want
134:12 - to do is play with this container a
134:14 - little bit and this is where i'm
134:17 - actually going to keep this utility
134:19 - class because it's something that's very
134:20 - useful but i'm going to change this to a
134:22 - second one which is grid container
134:24 - and the reason why i'm gonna do this is
134:26 - actually because of this page right here
134:29 - um if it wasn't for that all the other
134:31 - pages we have actually have like a very
134:32 - consistent spacing on everything but
134:34 - here we have this image that peels off
134:36 - the side and stretches off and sort of
134:38 - breaks out of the container and so by
134:41 - coming up with a grid container that's
134:43 - going to replace our regular one it's
134:44 - going to be the easiest way to achieve
134:46 - that type of effect and this is one of
134:48 - those important things that i know we
134:49 - created in our design system before you
134:51 - do want to keep an eye on what's
134:52 - happening on the other pages but just we
134:54 - didn't have to make a layout yet so i
134:56 - didn't want to dive into creating the
134:57 - grids and all of that at that time i
134:59 - really wanted to focus on all of those
135:01 - sort of more functional utility classes
135:03 - and now we're worrying a bit more about
135:04 - layout so we'll dive into here
135:07 - and how we can sort of set something up
135:08 - like this that will help when you get to
135:10 - this page here
135:12 - and so for the grid container i'm let's
135:14 - go back over to our index here and let's
135:16 - find that container class because we
135:17 - actually want to sort of replicate it
135:19 - but with grid in an interesting way
135:21 - so we have a regular one there so i'm
135:23 - going to come here and i'm going to do
135:24 - grid
135:25 - container
135:26 - and so this is going to be a display
135:28 - grid as the name sort of entails
135:30 - and i had a padding in line of 2m before
135:33 - for the spacing on the left and the
135:34 - right and i want to maintain that
135:36 - so one way we can maintain that is and
135:38 - all this will be with our grid template
135:39 - columns that i'm going to set up so we
135:41 - could do a 2m on that side something
135:44 - here and then a 2m on the other side and
135:46 - that means that we have
135:48 - like a grid column on the left that will
135:50 - be two a grid column on the right that
135:52 - will be two and then something in the
135:54 - middle that could be something looks
135:55 - something like this and that could sort
135:58 - of set the stage so if you have an idea
135:59 - of how we could do that to sort of set
136:01 - the stage with this 80 in the middle
136:04 - without it being locked in 80 because if
136:05 - i do 80 rem here and i hit save on that
136:08 - it's actually going to like break
136:09 - everything right because now we have
136:10 - this grid that's locked in at 80 pixels
136:13 - wide and you can see everything sort of
136:14 - went all wonky because of how the
136:16 - some stuff is actually going into those
136:18 - columns that are two ram on the two
136:20 - sides that we don't want to do right now
136:22 - but uh we can see that we have this sort
136:24 - of broken thing with a lot of over
136:26 - scroll going on so if you know how to
136:28 - fix that and you've used grid before and
136:30 - you can think of a solution you can come
136:31 - in and do that now and if you're not
136:32 - sure just wait a second and i'll give my
136:34 - solution
136:36 - all right so instead of doing an adram
136:38 - like that what we can do is a min max
136:41 - and with a min max value if you've never
136:43 - seen it it's let's set a minimum value
136:45 - and a maximum value and so we could say
136:48 - is zero pixels can actually literally be
136:50 - zero and then the largest it's allowed
136:52 - to get to is my adren and i'm gonna go
136:55 - with a bit smaller here just um so we
136:56 - can see it a little bit better in
136:57 - scrimba what's actually happening and
137:00 - let's hit save on that and go take a
137:01 - look and you can see that now things are
137:04 - there and you will see that it is
137:05 - actually still sort of breaking but
137:06 - that's just because the button is
137:08 - overflowing it has nothing to do with
137:09 - anything else it's really just the
137:10 - button overflowing out the side you can
137:12 - see that that middle area is actually
137:14 - shrinking and growing right now whereas
137:15 - if i switch this back to just being
137:17 - let's do 60 for the moment
137:19 - and i come back you can see that text in
137:21 - the middle it's not shrinking because
137:22 - it's locked in because this is what's in
137:24 - that middle column right now
137:26 - so by having the min max here instead it
137:29 - means the middle area is growing and
137:31 - shrinking
137:32 - the only thing is we don't have one
137:34 - column really in the middle we have two
137:36 - and we have two here and every page has
137:38 - two columns on it
137:40 - so for me the easier solution isn't only
137:42 - to have one column here it would be to
137:44 - have two columns instead if you can
137:46 - think of a way to do that go ahead right
137:47 - now and set that up
137:51 - all right so there's a couple of
137:52 - different ways we could do it we could
137:53 - actually just take this i'm going to
137:55 - drop that down to 30. i'll do 40 so we
137:57 - go back to our original 80 size that we
137:58 - had
138:00 - and we could just take this and put two
138:02 - of them and so we're saying we have one
138:04 - column is two rem one column is this one
138:06 - column is this and then that so now we
138:08 - actually have four columns you can see
138:09 - my layout has changed a little bit
138:10 - because everything is sort of just
138:12 - trying to squeeze into the spaces it has
138:13 - available and that works and that gives
138:16 - us our four columns
138:18 - if you want to make this a little bit
138:19 - shorter another way you could achieve
138:20 - the same thing is by doing a repeat here
138:24 - and then with repeat you can repeat
138:26 - things as the name sort of implies so we
138:28 - do repeat comma and then ha so repeat
138:31 - two times and this so we're getting two
138:33 - columns of our min max 040 and then a 2m
138:36 - on both sides now i am going to do one
138:38 - more step and then give you a little
138:40 - challenge to do so
138:42 - let's go and take a look at what we've
138:44 - created just really fast here where we
138:46 - have our grid container and we have all
138:48 - of this in our grid container
138:51 - so for this to really work and the
138:53 - easiest way i think just to make sure
138:54 - this is grouped on one side and that
138:56 - button is grouped over on the other side
138:58 - i'm going to wrap this and i'm literally
139:00 - i'm not even going to name this class
139:02 - i'm just going to do a div that ends
139:04 - right here close div and if you named it
139:06 - that's perfectly fine but we don't
139:08 - really need to name it
139:10 - uh for this purpose and then we open a
139:11 - div there and we're gonna close that div
139:13 - right here close div and let's just fix
139:16 - our spacing a little bit here okay so we
139:18 - have a grid container with one and two
139:20 - children in there and in every situation
139:23 - for the other pages we can do the same
139:24 - thing so here we could have one for this
139:26 - one and then one over here and the other
139:29 - pages well we can set these all up to
139:31 - have two columns effectively inside of
139:33 - them and even our button i don't know if
139:34 - it even needs to be in a div necessarily
139:36 - we could just leave that on its own but
139:38 - we'll leave this like this for now just
139:40 - because it makes it a bit more
139:41 - repeatable
139:42 - where you just throw whatever content
139:43 - you need into each one of the columns so
139:45 - what we can do for that is and again
139:48 - this wouldn't necessarily work for every
139:50 - possible site that you're doing in the
139:52 - future but
139:54 - in this one where it's very consistent
139:56 - how this grid container is going to work
139:57 - from page to page to page we could say
140:00 - the first child is a grid column
140:03 - of one over two and you could actually
140:05 - we could just say one and it's going to
140:06 - work and then we can take that same
140:08 - thing and you want to guess what i'm
140:10 - going to change this to
140:12 - that would be last child here and that
140:14 - would get a great column of two and i
140:16 - just realized this should actually be
140:18 - two and three
140:19 - now the one problem that we're running
140:21 - into if we go and take a look is well we
140:23 - have some overflow we're going to talk
140:24 - about that in a minute and there's
140:26 - actually two things i can think of that
140:27 - i think you could try and do one of them
140:29 - is something we've already looked at so
140:31 - if you're not familiar with grid i think
140:32 - you could still solve this problem and
140:34 - there's a second one where our content
140:35 - is actually stuck to the left of the
140:37 - page instead of being centered on the
140:39 - page and again we're trying to recreate
140:40 - this idea with a margin of zero auto or
140:44 - auto on the left and the right we're not
140:45 - doing that with our grid this is my auto
140:48 - feature or function right here so the
140:51 - first thing is i want some spacing in
140:52 - between them now we have overflow that's
140:54 - happening because of the the sizes on
140:56 - some of this and this text is actually
140:57 - overflowing because it's one word we're
140:59 - gonna solve that problem later
141:01 - um but i want like here you can see how
141:03 - close this text is getting to my button
141:06 - so
141:07 - think of something we've done before
141:08 - that has allowed us to add space so you
141:10 - can try doing that and if you're
141:12 - familiar with grid see if you can find a
141:13 - solution to these two m things on the
141:15 - side to actually have them act as a
141:19 - a buffer at small screens that will
141:21 - allow as much space as we need at big
141:23 - screens
141:25 - so let's start with one of them which is
141:26 - my gap and we can just come in and say a
141:28 - gap of say to ram and that's going to
141:30 - give us a space and i'm actually going
141:32 - to do this one only as a column gap not
141:34 - that we have any rows but just in case
141:36 - and so the column gap is in between
141:38 - these so you can just see now compared
141:40 - to before and if you want you can pause
141:42 - and comment the code out and play with
141:43 - it you'll just notice that this text
141:45 - here isn't getting as close to there
141:47 - delete the word space even if you want
141:49 - and it might give you a better
141:50 - illustration that we're getting now a
141:52 - gap in between my button and what we
141:54 - have on this side so you can give that a
141:56 - try if you want but we've also seen that
141:58 - we can come in and we can come in here
142:00 - and give this a ver and i'm going to
142:02 - call this one container gutter and it
142:04 - could be container or no with container
142:06 - gap just because it would be more
142:07 - consistent with the naming that we've
142:08 - had on other gaps throughout here and we
142:11 - could default that to to rem and that
142:13 - way if we need to change it for some of
142:15 - the different pages where we need less
142:16 - space or more space it becomes very easy
142:19 - to do and if we don't need to change it
142:20 - it just sticks at the to rem the other
142:22 - solution was that spacing thing on the
142:24 - sides where we don't want it to stay
142:26 - here
142:27 - so for this and this if you don't know
142:29 - grid you probably wouldn't know the
142:31 - solution to this but it would be a min
142:33 - max where the minimum is 2m
142:35 - and this could be rem 2. it wouldn't
142:37 - change anything in this situation and
142:39 - then the large is a 1fr and fr pretty
142:42 - much just means take as much space as
142:44 - you need or take the available space and
142:48 - use it
142:49 - so if both of this have a one fr and a
142:51 - one fr when we get to the larger sizes
142:53 - it will hold the content in the middle
142:54 - now the only issue is uh in my window
142:57 - right now in scrimba is a little bit
142:58 - small so i'm gonna bring this down to 30
143:01 - just so we can really visualize what's
143:02 - happening but if you're on a larger
143:03 - screen you could leave that at 40 or you
143:06 - could choose a different number that you
143:07 - want for the total there and what we can
143:09 - do is come take a look now and we should
143:11 - see let's refresh our page and when it's
143:13 - at the small sizes we have our two
143:14 - columns ignoring the overflowing text
143:16 - but you can see that this text in this
143:18 - text is breaking so we have two columns
143:20 - right there and actually let's highlight
143:21 - those let's just come here and say uh
143:23 - outline
143:24 - one pixel solid red just so we can
143:26 - really see what's happening and this one
143:29 - can be a one pixel solid yellow
143:33 - and if we go and take a look we can see
143:34 - our two columns now and just that the
143:36 - space is overflowing out and they're
143:38 - gonna get bigger bigger bigger and then
143:39 - at one point there we go they lock in at
143:41 - that size and those two other ones those
143:44 - frs come in and save the day and just
143:46 - hold everything in the middle of the
143:48 - page and that's one of my favorite
143:49 - things to do with grid so we can see
143:51 - that that i think is looking really nice
143:53 - right now it's working great so if you
143:54 - want to play around with this experiment
143:56 - with that a little to really understand
143:57 - what's happening go ahead and do that
143:59 - and then i'll see you soon in the next
144:01 - lesson
144:04 - all right so we can continue on our
144:05 - homepage and start trying to get it a
144:07 - little bit closer to what we see on the
144:09 - page right now uh one of the things that
144:11 - we are going to do though is we're going
144:13 - to take advantage and you might remember
144:15 - a long time ago when we did our reset
144:18 - on the body itself i gave it a minimum
144:20 - height of 100 vh and this is really
144:22 - going to help us
144:23 - because if we come and look at our grid
144:25 - container right now and i look at here
144:28 - and i look at the height of it now let's
144:29 - do an outline of
144:31 - five pixels solid
144:33 - and we'll do lime green so it stands out
144:36 - compared to the other outlines we have
144:37 - and it's not stretching the entire space
144:40 - that we need and ideally it would just
144:41 - take up the rest of the available space
144:43 - on the page so one way we can take
144:45 - advantage of that minimum height we did
144:47 - on our body and this is going to help us
144:49 - on all these pages that we're creating
144:50 - right now
144:51 - is along with this we're going to add a
144:53 - little bit more we're actually going to
144:55 - throw a display of grid on here which is
144:58 - going to help all the items that are on
144:59 - here stretch out
145:01 - now when we go and take a look what's
145:03 - happened is now you can actually see it
145:05 - it is stretching out and we don't quite
145:06 - see the bottom of this but effectively
145:08 - they're stretching but there's this
145:09 - weird thing going on in the height as
145:11 - you can see
145:12 - which is that then it's sort of dividing
145:14 - the space somewhat equally
145:16 - and it's the leftover space underneath
145:18 - my navigation is the same as the
145:20 - leftover space here and it's dividing it
145:22 - between the two of them
145:23 - so to fix that i'm going to set up a
145:25 - grid template rose
145:27 - and we're going to do a min content for
145:29 - the top and an auto or one of our uh for
145:32 - the bottom and what that's going to give
145:34 - us now if we go back look at that we
145:37 - have the grid itself is stretching the
145:39 - outline's actually bleeding off the side
145:41 - of the page a little bit so maybe what
145:42 - we'll do is we'll find our grid
145:44 - container here and we'll just switch
145:46 - that outline
145:47 - that we had to a border
145:50 - so now we'll actually see there we go we
145:52 - can actually see the border uh on our
145:54 - screen
145:55 - and now we can see how that's sort of
145:57 - giving us a lot more room to play with
145:59 - so our entire page is a display grid
146:01 - which is allowing this to stretch and
146:02 - fit that minimum height that we have and
146:04 - now we also have the advantage within
146:06 - this of the
146:08 - because the green box our our grid
146:10 - container is a grid that we have the
146:12 - grid inside here and we can play with
146:14 - the positioning of our elements within
146:16 - that
146:16 - now obviously we've run into a few
146:18 - little things is small screens this is
146:20 - definitely not working so let's fix that
146:22 - and we're going to use a media query to
146:24 - do it so here where i have my grid
146:26 - container it's really nice and easy to
146:28 - do we can keep everything here exactly
146:31 - the same i'm just going to grab this
146:33 - take it out and put a media query so add
146:35 - media
146:36 - and i'm gonna do a min width and we'll
146:39 - talk about what my min width is going to
146:40 - be in a second but then we can choose
146:42 - our grid container once again and throw
146:44 - that right in there
146:45 - and the other thing i do want to do is
146:47 - actually grab these right here and also
146:49 - move them up into this media query
146:51 - because
146:52 - this is a display grid um and i you know
146:54 - we could move this grid down to here but
146:56 - it could come in and be useful for gaps
146:58 - and other things so i'm going to leave
146:59 - the grid on the grid container itself
147:01 - but that could be something we move off
147:03 - into the media query but um because this
147:05 - has a grid column two and a grid column
147:07 - of three
147:08 - even though we're not defining any grid
147:10 - columns here it will actually place them
147:12 - on a grid column two and three will
147:14 - create those columns for us because
147:16 - we're telling them they have to live
147:17 - there so if we do this now what it's
147:19 - going to do is actually it will only
147:21 - apply them when we've created our
147:23 - explicit columns here and i'm going to
147:25 - go with a 45 rem which comes out to i
147:28 - think it's about 760 pixels which is
147:30 - often where like these tablet layouts
147:32 - sort of reach that maximum size you want
147:35 - and things start looking ugly on them
147:36 - and we want to sort of go more into the
147:38 - desktop style layout so i'm going to do
147:40 - it like that and let's go and take a
147:42 - look at what that's given us so when we
147:43 - look at the smaller sizes now we can see
147:45 - that there we go it's breaking we have
147:47 - some overflow that's happening because
147:48 - of the navigation so why don't uh in the
147:51 - meantime until we get to that let's just
147:52 - take our navigation and comment it out
147:54 - so we can really focus on what's
147:56 - happening here so there we go we can see
147:57 - we have my two columns that are then
147:59 - turning into one column and everything
148:00 - is stacking and then we can go back to
148:02 - our two and that is pretty awesome now
148:05 - we're missing some things that are
148:06 - specific to the home page layout but as
148:08 - far as the functionality of the
148:09 - container itself i think it's working
148:11 - really well at this point and it should
148:13 - work for us uh well at on all of the
148:15 - pages we are running into a few
148:17 - different things that we clearly have
148:19 - this space thing that is you know the
148:20 - space is overflowing out the side which
148:22 - is a little bit problematic and ideally
148:25 - you know our container would probably be
148:26 - a little bit bigger than this as i
148:27 - mentioned but i set it to a smaller size
148:29 - but it would still run into this
148:30 - potential problem of some overflow
148:32 - happening and that is something that's
148:34 - actually going to affect us across
148:36 - multiple pages with the titles and i'll
148:38 - explore why that is in the next lesson
148:44 - okay so this space right here is causing
148:46 - us some issues where it's overflowing
148:48 - and as i mentioned this is going to
148:50 - happen on other pages as well and this
148:52 - is going to happen because we focused on
148:54 - the design system that was provided and
148:56 - actually all the font sizes there were
148:57 - based on the largest sizes available and
149:00 - not on the tablet or on the smallest one
149:03 - and if you go into your figma file
149:04 - you'll be able to do the inspecting and
149:06 - find all the font sizes you need and
149:08 - you'll see that some of them are only
149:10 - smaller at smallest screen sizes some of
149:12 - them at the tablet screen size they're a
149:13 - little bit bigger and then they get even
149:15 - bigger at the large one and our big
149:17 - space title here is one of those ones
149:18 - that does adjust between the different
149:20 - screen sizes and the different layouts
149:22 - and there are many other ones that do as
149:24 - well so if you want to go through and
149:26 - dive in and get them you can i don't
149:28 - mind if you do all the hard work there
149:29 - but this is going to be made a lot
149:31 - easier for us because of these utility
149:33 - classes and especially these custom
149:35 - properties that we created
149:37 - uh if you come from a background with
149:39 - sas variables and you haven't done a lot
149:40 - with custom properties you might
149:42 - remember a system where you'd have like
149:44 - a font size small 900 font size medium
149:46 - 900 font size large 900 and then you'd
149:48 - actually have media queries where you're
149:50 - changing what this is the font size
149:52 - every time so my 900 you have to
149:54 - redefine each one of these selectors
149:57 - within a media query every time
149:59 - luckily we don't have to do that anymore
150:01 - with custom properties because we can
150:02 - redefine custom properties within a
150:04 - media query and we've already made that
150:06 - executive decision that our larger
150:08 - screen sizes will kick in here at the 45
150:11 - rem
150:11 - so i'm going to come up and use that
150:13 - over here i'm going to say that we're
150:15 - going to have our at media with a min
150:18 - width of 45 rem
150:21 - and in here we can do our route and if
150:23 - you're up to it and you want to redefine
150:24 - all the sizes these are as i mentioned
150:26 - the ones from our largest screen size so
150:29 - that would be the ones that go here
150:32 - if we want to sort of follow along with
150:34 - what the what's provided in the figma
150:36 - file we can have an app media min width
150:39 - of around 35 rem which would be our
150:41 - tablet sizes and this comes up to 560
150:44 - pixels and actually i put ram on all of
150:46 - these i normally use m for my media
150:48 - queries
150:49 - and there is a reason for that and it's
150:50 - just safari treats media queries a
150:53 - little bit differently
150:55 - than the other browsers if you zoom in
150:57 - and out on them and if you use rem or
151:00 - pixels whereas if you
151:02 - have them set in m it actually treats it
151:05 - in a similar way so we'll go with m on
151:06 - these so everything sort of behaves the
151:09 - same between all the different browsers
151:11 - um and this is where the tablet one
151:13 - would come in as i said it's around 560
151:16 - pixels so it's a little bit bigger than
151:18 - the tap the mobile design but we're
151:19 - getting into that tablet and then here
151:21 - we'd hit the larger sizes
151:23 - at this point so if you want to go
151:25 - through and dive in and try and redefine
151:28 - them all and get all of these and then
151:30 - see if it matches up with what i come up
151:31 - with by all means you can go for it and
151:34 - in just a few seconds i'll just come in
151:35 - and do it so if you just want to wait
151:36 - for that
151:37 - and then see the magic results of it all
151:39 - you can come in and we're going to do
151:40 - one more thing with our typography
151:42 - before i let you go
151:46 - all right so i'm going to start with the
151:47 - tablet layout and the tablet sizes which
151:50 - are going to be right here
151:52 - and these are at the smallest one so
151:53 - that that's going through all of the
151:55 - tablet ones just finding each one
151:57 - correlating it to the design system we
151:59 - had and these are the sizes that i found
152:02 - then what i want to do is i want to come
152:04 - in and get the ones for my uh right here
152:09 - just like that and you'll notice i'm not
152:10 - redefining all of them i'm only
152:12 - redefining the ones that are changing so
152:14 - my body font size went from this really
152:17 - small
152:18 - 15 pixels to a 16 so we can go to one
152:20 - rem and then at the larger sizes it goes
152:22 - up to the 18 so we can redefine each one
152:24 - of those along the way whereas the 300
152:27 - it stays the same throughout all of them
152:29 - and the 200 also i believe stays the
152:31 - same throughout all of them except here
152:33 - actually we also have this one that
152:34 - would come in right there
152:36 - because that's where this one gets to
152:38 - the biggest size and then
152:40 - on this one again this we don't need
152:42 - here anymore this one so the 900 is at
152:45 - the same
152:46 - 800 they're not the same so we'd leave
152:49 - 800 700 is bigger 600 is bigger
152:52 - 500 is the same as we had in our
152:55 - original one so i don't need to redefine
152:57 - it 400 we want and then these two i also
153:00 - don't need because they're the same as
153:01 - our original declaration here
153:04 - so this is where we're starting we're
153:05 - changing them and then changing them
153:07 - again here so if we go and take a look
153:09 - we should see that space we're still
153:11 - going to have an overflow issue but
153:12 - we're going to see that when we get to a
153:14 - small enough size that it is redefining
153:16 - so we know the media query is working we
153:18 - can see that everything is working we
153:19 - can see those font sizes switching
153:22 - on the body as well as we go through on
153:24 - these and the body font size gets
153:25 - smaller and then it gets smaller again
153:28 - even though some of those changes are a
153:29 - little minor and hard to see
153:31 - they are happy or the button especially
153:33 - you can see the button gets smaller and
153:34 - smaller there and maybe we'll have to
153:36 - adjust that actually so it doesn't get
153:37 - too small at small screens but i did
153:39 - mention we're going to do one thing a
153:40 - little bit differently um and that is
153:42 - with these really big font sizes we can
153:44 - actually run into some problems with
153:46 - them as we can see here with our space
153:47 - and this is where sometimes executive
153:49 - decisions have to come in but we also
153:51 - have like this thing right where we have
153:52 - the tablet where we're here and
153:54 - everything maybe would be okay then we
153:56 - have the bigger font one and then like
153:57 - where do we get things to change um and
154:00 - so we know this is our smallest size we
154:02 - know that this is our biggest size so
154:04 - what i'm actually going to do is remove
154:05 - this completely and come in with a clamp
154:08 - value here instead and if you don't know
154:09 - about clamp clamp allows us to do is set
154:11 - a minimum size so we know the smallest
154:13 - we want it to ever get is 5 ram it
154:15 - allows us to set a middle value and it
154:17 - allows us to set a maximum and the
154:19 - maximum was our 9.375
154:23 - rem and for the middle value we wanted
154:25 - something that's going to allow it to
154:26 - grow and to shrink so what we often see
154:29 - is viewport units and usually if you're
154:31 - using viewport units it's a good idea to
154:33 - also include a rem value as well just to
154:36 - uh viewport units won't react to zooming
154:38 - in and out so if somebody needs to zoom
154:40 - in and out it could lock things in so
154:42 - even though this is really big i'm still
154:44 - going to do it just for best practice
154:45 - and the you the one thing that can be
154:47 - really hard to figure out is this and it
154:49 - just takes experimentation you could try
154:51 - with 10 and then we could take a look at
154:53 - what it's looking like so we can see
154:54 - that that text is getting bigger and
154:56 - smaller as the screen is shrinking and
154:59 - we see it's not actually causing any
155:00 - issues so maybe you like 10 and you can
155:02 - see it here it's not shrinking anymore
155:04 - and we get big enough at one point if we
155:06 - had a bigger screen it would lock in and
155:07 - it wouldn't get any bigger and we're
155:08 - probably very close to where it's
155:10 - locking in
155:11 - and you could try doing this at a
155:12 - smaller growth factor so five would be
155:14 - much smaller so you can see the text is
155:16 - really small it's going to be harder for
155:18 - that to even start to grow because that
155:20 - five viewport unit's not even kicking in
155:22 - or you could come in with 50 viewport
155:23 - units and then it's basically always
155:24 - going to be the biggest size
155:26 - because 50 viewport units is so big and
155:29 - the viewport units is just based on the
155:30 - width of the screen
155:32 - so if you want to experiment play with
155:34 - this i'm going to go with around 8 but
155:35 - if you want to play with that experiment
155:37 - with this
155:38 - there's also a v-min and v-max that you
155:40 - can play around with and have some fun
155:41 - with it do a quick search on those if
155:43 - you haven't heard of them because they
155:45 - look at either the width or the height
155:47 - depending on the situation and they can
155:48 - be kind of interesting too and play with
155:51 - that if you want to try playing around
155:52 - with some of these other ones instead
155:54 - and replacing them with clamps as well
155:55 - go for it explore that and then when
155:58 - you're ready i'll see you in the next
155:59 - lesson
156:02 - all right so we've fixed some problems
156:04 - but we still have other ones that are
156:05 - left and one of those problems is our
156:07 - title going in a big string all the way
156:09 - across like this at certain screen sizes
156:12 - before it breaks back down like that and
156:14 - even here you can see like the word two
156:15 - is squeezing in next to it and it
156:17 - doesn't look very nice
156:18 - we have some layout issues as well but
156:20 - for this lesson i just want to focus on
156:22 - fixing this title so let's just quickly
156:25 - look at my markup where how we did that
156:26 - we have an h1
156:28 - right there with our span inside of it
156:30 - and if you have a rough idea of maybe
156:31 - how we can fix that from happening why
156:33 - don't you jump in and tackle that right
156:35 - now and then in a second i will show you
156:37 - my own solution
156:40 - all right so there's a few different
156:42 - ways that you could solve this and one
156:44 - of them would be in your css doing
156:46 - something and i'm going to throw it at
156:47 - the bottom because we're actually going
156:48 - to delete this in a second but this is
156:49 - maybe an approach you took you did h1
156:52 - span and then we said display of
156:55 - block or something like that and that
156:57 - would work 100
156:58 - if we go and take a look we should
156:59 - actually see that it is working so if
157:01 - you thought of that there we go we can
157:03 - see that because now the word space here
157:05 - is always
157:07 - selected there is always a display of
157:09 - block nothing can go next to it so no
157:10 - matter what happens no matter what
157:12 - layout we come in with space is always
157:14 - going to be on its own line
157:16 - and this works but it's a little bit
157:18 - dangerous because we will have h1s on
157:20 - other pages and that could potentially
157:22 - and actually would run us into some
157:24 - trouble when we get to those so this is
157:26 - where a class would be better suited
157:28 - here it could be like home page homepage
157:30 - title maybe could be something that you
157:32 - could use to do the same thing and then
157:34 - over on your homepage you could do you
157:36 - know add that or for me this is doing
157:39 - one thing and it's only doing one thing
157:41 - we don't need it to do anything else
157:43 - when you have declarations like that go
157:45 - could this be
157:47 - a
157:48 - display block utility class instead i
157:50 - don't even know if we're going to need
157:51 - one anywhere else on our site but i'm
157:54 - just going to move it up here so it's
157:55 - within our utility classes my grid we
157:58 - have a display flex a display grid and
158:00 - now a display block and again if
158:02 - something's doing one thing and one
158:03 - thing only it's usually a good idea just
158:05 - to turn that into a utility class so you
158:07 - can use it in other places if you need
158:09 - to so then i could come over here and on
158:12 - that span we could just add the d block
158:13 - to it
158:14 - and
158:15 - there we go it solved that problem it's
158:17 - never going to be on more than one line
158:23 - all right so i'm going to give you a bit
158:24 - of a mini layout challenge now and what
158:27 - that's going to be is actually to see if
158:30 - you can accomplish the same layout right
158:32 - now with what we have and you might have
158:33 - to play around with things a little bit
158:35 - but without a grid container and instead
158:37 - switching this over to using flexbox and
158:40 - hopefully for you to be able to see why
158:42 - i chose grid to do this in the first
158:44 - place so i'm going to leave this here
158:46 - for you to tackle and do what you can
158:48 - with so i'll pop so i'll stop talking
158:50 - for a few seconds to let you hit pause
158:52 - and come in and try your best with it
158:54 - and see what you can do to get as close
158:55 - to the layout that we had you might have
158:57 - to add more divs or play with different
158:59 - classes go into the css do whatever you
159:01 - need to do to get it to work and then
159:03 - when you want you can hit play again and
159:05 - you can watch me take my own try at it
159:09 - all right so let's come in here and i'm
159:11 - just going to add we have the flex
159:12 - utility class so let's start by adding
159:14 - that and well there we go they go next
159:15 - to each one one another and that's what
159:17 - we sort of wanted in the first place so
159:19 - that's not bad except obviously being a
159:21 - little bit too wide
159:22 - and we want to be able to stop it and we
159:24 - were using our grid for that but luckily
159:25 - we also have a container class that we
159:27 - had created so i'm going to bring that
159:28 - on there the only issue right now is my
159:30 - container did have a max width of 80 rim
159:34 - versus the 60 where we're using and so
159:36 - just for now i will come in with a max
159:38 - width here of 60 of course i could go in
159:40 - the css and do the same thing but just
159:42 - to get a little bit closer to what we
159:44 - had before and there we go we're getting
159:46 - there it's a little bit better but it's
159:48 - definitely not matching the design where
159:49 - we have this big space in the middle and
159:52 - we're not limiting the length of things
159:53 - and it's not quite the same and right
159:55 - away this is one of the things that i
159:57 - really like about using grid in certain
159:59 - situations is i can create a grid and i
160:01 - can just sort of lock things into it now
160:03 - with the grid we didn't have a gigantic
160:05 - gap between them and here obviously we
160:07 - do but one of the things that we're
160:09 - going to see in the future lessons this
160:10 - is going to have a 50 of the room to
160:12 - play with but within that 50
160:14 - we can easily align this in the bottom
160:16 - right side and so the cell is actually
160:19 - going to be taking up a lot of room and
160:20 - the content of it is moving over and it
160:22 - creates that space and then as things
160:25 - are shrinking down these both state 50
160:27 - width but just this empty space here
160:29 - that from that 50 percent is a little
160:30 - bit less so things just sort of flow
160:32 - really nicely and that's one of the
160:34 - reasons for bigger layout pieces even
160:36 - though this is sort of like a 2d layout
160:37 - right we're just doing two columns like
160:39 - that i'm using
160:41 - i'm using grid more and more for that
160:42 - type of thing even if i just need two
160:44 - columns
160:45 - i find it a little bit easier to set up
160:47 - and so like one way we could go i'm
160:49 - going to create an even columns class
160:50 - here even columns
160:52 - and then we can come over into my css
160:54 - and here with my flex what we'll say is
160:57 - if it's flex with even columns and this
160:59 - is just to be really clear i'm deleting
161:00 - it anyway so i'm just going to leave it
161:02 - like this
161:03 - actually i don't want to do anything on
161:04 - that i want to select both children and
161:06 - then we can give both of these a width
161:08 - of 100 and there's other ways of doing
161:10 - this as well this isn't the only way to
161:12 - do it and let's just save here so i save
161:14 - my class with it and now we actually do
161:16 - get two even columns
161:18 - and just to show you that they are
161:20 - actually even columns let's also give
161:22 - these an outline of one pixel solid lime
161:25 - green just so we can see them
161:28 - and now we have two even columns in
161:30 - there and then i can take this explorer
161:32 - and actually push it over to the right
161:33 - side a little bit more um and there's
161:35 - different ways of doing that we could
161:37 - create a class for it we could come in
161:38 - and play around
161:40 - um one thing we could do is actually on
161:41 - this div we could give like here i'm
161:43 - just gonna we'll do an inline style
161:45 - again because we're gonna delete all
161:46 - this and so here i could do another
161:48 - display flex and then do an align
161:51 - uh not a line justify dust defy
161:54 - content flex and
161:56 - um and that should line things up over
161:59 - on that side or it can just break
162:01 - everything and it's doing that that's
162:03 - also going to need an align items
162:06 - start i think we'll fix it there we go
162:09 - and the reason that happened was just
162:10 - because by default it's stretch and
162:12 - because we have an aspect ratio of one
162:14 - so it's stretching that way and then the
162:15 - aspect ratio is just making it huge and
162:17 - it's actually overflowing out of the
162:18 - area that it has to live so this flex
162:21 - start means it has to live at the top
162:23 - and then the justify content pushes it
162:25 - all the way over to the right side
162:27 - and this is where with flex you're doing
162:29 - a display flex or something and then you
162:31 - have to do something like your even
162:32 - columns where you actually have to
162:33 - select the children and
162:36 - do different things like a flex one
162:37 - would work here flex basis 100 will work
162:40 - here i'm not going to go into those
162:41 - differences now it does create all these
162:43 - sort of little moving pieces and that's
162:45 - a nice thing with flex when you want
162:46 - something to flex like we're going to
162:48 - use in our navigation you sort of want
162:50 - these pieces to do their own thing to a
162:51 - certain extent whereas grid is much more
162:54 - structured and the parent has so much
162:55 - control over everything and we're going
162:57 - to see that we can sort of accomplish
162:59 - the similar thing that we just set up
163:00 - now but with grid and see that why i
163:03 - chose grid in the first place
163:05 - and for now i'm actually going to leave
163:06 - this here just in case you want to play
163:08 - around and experiment with it a little
163:09 - bit when you get to the next lesson
163:11 - it'll all be gone we'll go back to our
163:12 - grid solution and start setting things
163:14 - up to actually work the way we need them
163:15 - to to get the layout to look exactly
163:17 - like we have here so i'll see you over
163:20 - in that lesson when you are ready
163:25 - so right now our layout is looking like
163:26 - this and obviously we need it to look a
163:28 - little bit different ignoring the
163:29 - background image
163:30 - we need the placement of these to be
163:32 - very different from what the placement
163:34 - is now and because we're doing a mobile
163:36 - first approach i am going to start at
163:37 - the smaller screens and worry about
163:39 - these first and then we'll work our way
163:40 - up through the other ones
163:42 - so if we come over to here we can see
163:44 - that at the small screens it's not
163:46 - actually terrible but it's not perfect
163:48 - either
163:49 - and there's a couple of different
163:50 - approaches we could take to fixing this
163:52 - but the first thing that i want to do is
163:53 - just get everything centered within the
163:55 - space that we have so as a quick
163:57 - refresher we have a grid container we
163:58 - could do some stuff with potentially but
164:00 - remember this also would have to be
164:02 - something that can apply to other pages
164:03 - as well
164:04 - we also have a body class of home that
164:06 - maybe could be useful
164:08 - if we feel the need for that let's just
164:10 - go look at our page here and you'll
164:11 - notice all the text and everything is
164:12 - centered and if we go and look at the
164:14 - other layouts as well
164:16 - on the other layouts on the mobile and
164:18 - this is the tablet designs were provided
164:20 - everything is centered on them uh for
164:22 - each and every one of them no matter
164:24 - what ignoring the top but like these
164:26 - parts and don't worry about these titles
164:27 - but like the main text on all of them is
164:29 - centered until we get to the large
164:31 - screen sizes so it follows the same
164:33 - pattern throughout so that is something
164:35 - we can do more generically to make sure
164:36 - everything is centered and then we could
164:38 - worry more locally about pulling these
164:41 - down to the bottom because that's
164:42 - something that's a bit more unique on
164:44 - the homepage design so if you know how
164:46 - we can get everything centered like this
164:48 - then why don't you go ahead and do that
164:50 - based on what i just talked about i'll
164:52 - drop you right here i won't give you any
164:53 - hints and i'll let you go and then
164:55 - shortly i'll give my own solution
165:00 - all right so the very first thing i'm
165:01 - going to do is actually on my grid
165:02 - container here i am going to come and
165:04 - say a text align center
165:07 - uh the reason i'm doing it on the grid
165:09 - container and not on the body is there
165:11 - you know i don't want i don't think it
165:12 - would have any effect on my navigation
165:14 - anyway because of how i'm setting things
165:16 - up but it's very specific on all the
165:18 - pages that it's sort of like the main
165:19 - things here that it's happening with
165:22 - i think if you put it on the body it
165:23 - wouldn't actually cause any issues so
165:24 - it'd be perfectly fine
165:26 - and then we already have our media query
165:28 - set up here for it which also is kind of
165:29 - convenient because then i can put my
165:31 - text align here and switch it back to
165:33 - left so when we get to the large screen
165:35 - sizes uh we can go back and forth so for
165:37 - the text alignment that fixes that and
165:39 - it's already looking a little bit better
165:40 - i think and you'll also notice that some
165:44 - stuff doesn't look terrible but this is
165:45 - kind of stuck to the top a little bit
165:48 - and we can fix that and i'm going to
165:49 - we'll fix this button
165:51 - at the same time while we're here and
165:53 - then of course at the large screen sizes
165:54 - we need everything a lot closer to the
165:56 - bottom so let's again start here and why
165:59 - don't we actually fix that explore
166:01 - button and this is one of those times
166:03 - where the explore button was using if we
166:05 - go and take a look
166:06 - i did put the font size 600 and i'm
166:08 - actually going to take that off because
166:10 - we don't want that one changing it's the
166:12 - only thing that i found on the entire
166:13 - design that doesn't actually change font
166:15 - size uh that had the font size 600
166:18 - sizing on it so we can just set that one
166:20 - manually which was to rem so if we come
166:22 - to here and we find my explore button
166:25 - which was my large button we can just do
166:27 - a search for that there and i can put a
166:29 - font size here so font size and i'm not
166:32 - even going to set it to my variable
166:34 - because again the variable is actually
166:35 - being redefined so i'm just going to put
166:37 - two ram here so it just stays at 2 ram
166:39 - all the time and this is something that
166:41 - i wouldn't actually do and i don't see
166:42 - very often but you know you have to make
166:45 - decisions and have to do these things
166:46 - every now and then and there we go i
166:48 - think that's looking a little bit more
166:50 - to how the design was actually meant to
166:52 - look when if you take a look at the the
166:55 - designs that were provided to us
166:57 - so we're making a bit of progress there
166:59 - now another thing we can do is i want to
167:01 - make sure that this text never actually
167:04 - gets this long and this is something
167:07 - that also comes up on every page if we
167:08 - go and take a look the text never gets
167:11 - too long on anything and there's a few
167:12 - different ways that we could tackle this
167:15 - i'm going to try and we could do it on a
167:16 - paragraph class and then do something to
167:18 - like center the paragraphs and stuff
167:20 - like that um which can actually become
167:23 - problematic when you get back up to
167:24 - these large screen sizes where this
167:27 - could actually become centered in a
167:28 - bigger space which could be a little bit
167:29 - annoying
167:30 - so uh what i'm actually going to do
167:33 - and this is a little bit different i
167:34 - won't lie compared to something i might
167:36 - do in other situations but on this grid
167:39 - container one solution that we could do
167:41 - is to say dot grid
167:44 - container
167:46 - and anything that's inside of it we're
167:48 - going to give it a max width
167:50 - of i'm going to go with 45 ch and we'll
167:53 - see what that does so 45 ch and if you
167:55 - don't know that's characters and it's
167:57 - equivalent the ch unit is equivalent to
167:59 - the
168:00 - zero character roughly the width of the
168:02 - zero character so there we go we can see
168:03 - it's limiting the length of our line and
168:06 - let's see what it looks like compared to
168:08 - here and i just realized the color i
168:09 - think is off on that too so
168:10 - uh we'll fix that in a second but it's
168:13 - not too bad maybe we could go a little
168:14 - bit bigger than that so i'll bump it up
168:16 - to 50.
168:18 - and we obviously run into the problem
168:20 - where it's stuck to the side and this is
168:23 - where we could try other things to try
168:25 - and solve this um but it's there's no
168:28 - problems here it's really just a problem
168:29 - here
168:30 - and it
168:32 - it's only a problem with the center
168:33 - aligned text you can see it's breaking
168:34 - everything everything is run into this a
168:36 - little bit of a mess
168:38 - right now but luckily it's not too hard
168:40 - to fix because we are using a display of
168:43 - grid on here
168:44 - and so what we can actually use on here
168:46 - is a place items of center and there's
168:49 - an align items center and a place items
168:51 - center they're a little bit different
168:53 - from each other one of them place item
168:55 - center is short for
168:57 - the justify items and align items
169:00 - whereas a place content would be short
169:02 - for align content and place content
169:05 - so we can compare the difference in a
169:06 - second but you can see that what it's
169:07 - done is it's actually pulled it's
169:09 - centering this is still and actually
169:11 - know what we'll do let's just take this
169:14 - i'm going to copy this i just it's going
169:15 - to help us visualize what's actually
169:17 - happening here
169:18 - so uh and let's delete these columns
169:20 - from here
169:22 - so you can see what it's done is it's
169:24 - actually it's centering this within like
169:26 - this top space and it's centering this
169:29 - within that bottom space that's right
169:30 - there um so as things get bigger and
169:32 - smaller it's distributing that space
169:35 - however we need and it's also centering
169:36 - them horizontally as well so it does a
169:39 - nice job of doing both of them
169:41 - if you used a place content rather than
169:44 - a place items so place content it's
169:46 - going to stick them together in the
169:48 - middle so now you can see that it's
169:50 - they're glued together there's no space
169:51 - it's putting all of the empty space on
169:53 - the top and all of the empty space on
169:55 - the bottom like that
169:57 - so that could also be useful if we want
169:59 - to go more with this approach because
170:00 - you feel that it matches with the design
170:02 - a little bit where we have a bit more
170:03 - space
170:05 - i do think the other one works better
170:06 - because of the large spacing that we
170:08 - could potentially get here on a tablet
170:09 - design right because we do have a lot of
170:11 - space we are using grid you could put
170:14 - this in as a gap value
170:16 - so we could keep it like that and then
170:18 - we could do a
170:20 - row gap and you could actually do this
170:23 - as a percentage so you could say like 10
170:25 - uh or 20 or 50
170:27 - and whatever that is we can see that
170:29 - it's putting that percentage here
170:30 - obviously it's causing overflows and
170:32 - other issues right now
170:34 - um so that is an option that you could
170:35 - do it could be viewport units as well
170:38 - but let's just say we did a
170:40 - 2 10 maybe
170:42 - um and the advantage with that is is if
170:44 - somebody's on a really small device
170:46 - where there's not a lot of vertical
170:48 - spacing
170:49 - it potentially works and then as that
170:51 - gets bigger that space increases so that
170:53 - could be something um to take into
170:55 - account or something to think about with
170:57 - this and how you want to set it up and
170:59 - create the spacing and then it does keep
171:00 - it off the top and the bottom or we go
171:03 - with the align the place items and then
171:06 - it puts more space here and it does
171:08 - leave us that cushion on the top and the
171:10 - bottom so things don't get too close so
171:12 - that's the solution i'm going to go with
171:13 - but both of them have their own merit
171:15 - and you might want to choose one over
171:17 - the other depending on what you need
171:19 - and the last thing is here at the small
171:21 - screen sizes we don't really want the
171:23 - text being able to touch the sides of
171:24 - the screen either that one's a nice easy
171:26 - one though there are multiple different
171:27 - ways we could do it but i'll let you
171:28 - give that a shot and then i'll be right
171:30 - back with my own solution
171:33 - okay so one of the solutions would
171:34 - actually be to do something very similar
171:36 - to this but to have only one
171:38 - column in the middle and keep that
171:40 - spacing on the sides if you want to do
171:42 - that by all means you could but it would
171:44 - it would involve um separate you know
171:46 - coming in and actually placing the items
171:48 - on the right
171:49 - um within the right spaces here because
171:51 - if not something could get sucked into
171:53 - those side little columns that we've
171:54 - created on the sides and i think a bit
171:57 - of a simpler solution than that is just
171:59 - to come in and add a bit of padding
172:01 - of zero on the top and bottom or we
172:03 - could do padding in line we've seen uh
172:05 - padding in line of say one ram on the
172:08 - left and the right and this could be a
172:10 - margin as well wouldn't make a
172:11 - difference but it just means that now
172:13 - when we get to there the content can
172:15 - never actually touch the side of the
172:16 - screen because we have a little bit of
172:18 - padding there and it just creates a
172:19 - little bit of a buffer and everything
172:20 - should still be fine we do technically
172:23 - have that padding here at the large
172:24 - screen sizes i don't think it would get
172:26 - in the way or cause any problems maybe
172:28 - then you want to drop these down to one
172:30 - just to make sure that it doesn't get
172:31 - too big at any of the screen sizes
172:33 - potentially and the very last thing we
172:34 - need to do now is to make sure that at
172:36 - larger screen sizes these sort of stick
172:38 - closer to the bottom than sticking to
172:40 - the top and we can sort of take
172:41 - advantage of some more grid behaviors uh
172:43 - along the way here so because again here
172:46 - i think everything is okay but here we
172:47 - need it much closer to the bottom but we
172:49 - do need some space which means we will
172:51 - have to do a few things all of this will
172:53 - have to happen in our grid container
172:55 - here i don't want to do it on all the
172:57 - grid containers though because it would
172:58 - have an effect on the other pages so
173:00 - there's two different approaches you
173:02 - could take to something like this one of
173:04 - them is we could come in on the index
173:07 - and we could actually add a different
173:08 - class here on the grid container and
173:11 - this is what i'm going to do just so
173:13 - it's more once again more of a utility
173:14 - class that we could use in other
173:16 - situations and we're going to have
173:18 - another little tweak as well so we could
173:20 - come in and add a new class here of like
173:22 - ho grid
173:23 - container home which is a modified
173:26 - version of our grid container this
173:28 - double slash is part of the bem naming
173:31 - convention which is sort of saying that
173:32 - we're modifying our grid container
173:36 - this could be something that could be
173:37 - also its own utility class of what i'm
173:39 - going to do or parts of this but because
173:42 - i'm not building out utility classes
173:43 - that can be changed within different
173:44 - media queries like you might see with
173:46 - something like tailwind i'm going to go
173:48 - with this approach if you have a
173:49 - different solution to getting the same
173:51 - thing that works
173:52 - and even we have our home class here so
173:54 - we can even choose like our good
173:56 - container from our home page only and
173:58 - select it that way as well so there's
173:59 - different ways we could select this
174:01 - and what we'll do with that is
174:04 - only within this media query because i
174:06 - want to make sure that it's only
174:07 - affecting at the largest screen sizes i
174:09 - am going to say that the grid container
174:12 - home
174:13 - is going to do two things one of them is
174:15 - it's going to have a padding bottom to
174:17 - create all that extra space on the
174:18 - bottom so i'm going to say that it's
174:19 - about six rem and why don't you try and
174:21 - figure out what it is to move within
174:23 - grid items all the way to the bottom if
174:25 - you're not familiar with grid you've
174:27 - seen a few things coming up now so maybe
174:29 - you have some ideas that you can test or
174:31 - just hit pause go into google and google
174:33 - that see research it see if you can find
174:35 - the solution before i give it to you in
174:37 - just a few seconds because that way
174:39 - you're reinforcing your learning you're
174:41 - going to remember a lot more so take the
174:42 - time to see if you can figure it out and
174:44 - as i said i will give you a solution i
174:45 - won't leave you hanging
174:48 - okay so i hope you did find that
174:49 - solution and i'm going to do an align
174:51 - items and put end on here which should
174:53 - move them all the way down to the bottom
174:56 - and with that i'm also going to save
174:57 - over here and look at that we have that
174:59 - they're lining up now on the bottom of
175:00 - the page and then as we get to the
175:02 - smaller screen size they stack back one
175:04 - on top of each other and we're okay and
175:06 - then we can go back to the bigger one
175:08 - and they're always going to be stuck on
175:10 - the bottom
175:10 - another solution that we can do that's
175:12 - kind of interesting with this bottom is
175:14 - we could actually put in a
175:17 - max function
175:18 - which would be six rem and we could put
175:21 - a percentage or viewport heights so say
175:23 - 20 viewport height and the advantage of
175:25 - this is if somebody was on a really big
175:27 - screen maybe you don't want it all the
175:29 - way stuck on the bottom and this max
175:31 - function it will take the bigger of the
175:33 - two values so it's bigger 20 viewport
175:36 - viewport height units or six rem and
175:39 - let's go and take a look i don't know if
175:41 - we can actually get it high enough to
175:42 - start influencing things right now
175:45 - i can't right now so all right i think
175:46 - it actually is changing so you can see
175:48 - that
175:49 - this is actually a little bit bigger um
175:51 - and then it's going to lock in at one
175:52 - point and it's going to get stuck to six
175:54 - rem and so i could even exaggerate this
175:56 - why don't we choose that at like 50 and
175:58 - you can see it's really big and now it's
176:00 - always going to be choosing the 51 and
176:01 - it's actually causing overflow because
176:03 - of it because it's always using the 50
176:05 - viewport height or if i made this one
176:08 - now the six ram is bigger so the six rim
176:10 - will probably always be bigger and it's
176:12 - always going to lock in just at the six
176:13 - ram
176:14 - so something i think like a 10 or a 20
176:17 - finds that nice balance where once it
176:19 - gets to a certain size that space is
176:21 - allowed to continue to grow so if you're
176:23 - on one of those ultra wide huge monitors
176:25 - that some people have these days at
176:27 - least things won't be like glued to the
176:28 - bottom of the page if for some reason
176:30 - they're actually on a full screen which
176:32 - i don't think many people do all right
176:33 - so there we go that's looking pretty
176:34 - good i think we can get rid of all of
176:36 - these borders now because we can see how
176:38 - things are fitting on the page and how
176:39 - everything is looking so when you get to
176:41 - the next lesson all of those will be
176:42 - turned off and we're going to be getting
176:43 - into the background images
176:47 - all right so with our background images
176:49 - here you can actually see the the image
176:51 - itself changes here we have it stuck to
176:53 - the bottom and then when the layout
176:54 - breaks and goes the other way we can see
176:56 - that things change and it goes on the
176:58 - side here instead of being stuck to the
177:00 - bottom and if we look in our assets we
177:02 - actually have three different images to
177:04 - use so let's go and take a look that's
177:06 - my home page and then we have a desktop
177:08 - a mobile and the tablet version
177:11 - that are all going to be coming in and
177:12 - then we can use all of them in our css
177:15 - and that is one of the reasons we have
177:16 - our home class right here that will
177:19 - enable us to select that so for that in
177:21 - my css i'm going to come all the way
177:23 - down to the bottom and we're going to
177:24 - create a new category called page
177:25 - specific
177:27 - we could take some of the container
177:30 - things that i created that were specific
177:31 - to this page and include them here if we
177:33 - wanted to
177:34 - and here i will put home for the home
177:36 - page because we will have some different
177:38 - ones that get changed for each of the
177:40 - different pages uh but overall we
177:42 - shouldn't have too much other than the
177:43 - background images uh actually and so
177:45 - here dot home let's start off with just
177:47 - putting a background image on here and
177:50 - seeing what happens so with the
177:51 - background image we need a url and we
177:54 - need in this case it's going to be from
177:56 - our root we're going into our
177:58 - assets
177:59 - and then assets it goes to home and then
178:01 - it goes to our background and i'm going
178:03 - to do home mobile mobile first dot jpeg
178:06 - because we're doing mobile first and
178:08 - there we go we can see a background
178:09 - image has come in and it's repeating
178:10 - itself like crazy but at least it's
178:12 - there and it's working and that's sort
178:14 - of as you'd expect at small screen you
178:15 - know at a big screen that that smaller
178:17 - image will repeat itself
178:18 - so let's do a few things here let's say
178:20 - that the
178:21 - background size is cover
178:24 - and we can don't need to bother with the
178:26 - background repeat no repeat because we
178:28 - do have the cover on there but the one
178:30 - thing that happens with the cover is it
178:32 - crops the image and i don't like how it
178:34 - crops it um because if we go if this for
178:37 - some reason we have a shorter page or
178:39 - whatever is happening the planet sort of
178:40 - disappears and i think there's a lot of
178:42 - visual interest with the planet so i'm
178:44 - also going to say background ground
178:46 - position of bottom center which is more
178:50 - or less where the interest lies in that
178:52 - so let's go take a look and now we're
178:54 - always keeping that planet bottom center
178:56 - of course it's getting too big here but
178:58 - that's okay because we're going to
178:59 - change it and then here too it's not
179:00 - looking good we can't read our text but
179:02 - we're going to be changing the image
179:03 - along the way so it shouldn't cause any
179:05 - problems as we go on to these bigger
179:07 - sizes now these shouldn't actually be on
179:09 - the home page so i'm going to take those
179:11 - off of here
179:12 - and i'm going to come body right here
179:14 - and place those here just to keep it a
179:16 - bit more organized
179:17 - i'm actually going to say backgrounds
179:19 - and this will just be for background
179:21 - images i think because i don't think we
179:23 - need any other page specific styling for
179:25 - anything
179:26 - and then it makes sense a little bit
179:27 - more having this body that's right there
179:30 - and what i want you to actually try and
179:31 - do now is to see if you can find a way
179:34 - to bring those other images in uh when
179:37 - we get to the different break points and
179:38 - just use the same breakpoints that i
179:39 - used above i think they should work
179:41 - perfectly fine for you
179:43 - all right so let's see how i would do
179:45 - that i would just come in here with a
179:46 - media query and on this media query
179:48 - we're going to give it a min width and
179:50 - the first one i used was my uh was a 35
179:53 - rem so we can come in with that and then
179:55 - we can come and copy this right here
179:57 - paste it in
179:58 - fix the tabs and then change this over
180:01 - to tablet and i saw something change
180:03 - already so when we're at the smallest
180:06 - screen sizes it's looking like that we
180:09 - start going and you can actually see the
180:10 - image is switching there because you can
180:11 - see it's getting blurry and then the
180:12 - crop on the image actually change is and
180:15 - it's when that crop happens that we're
180:17 - switching over and then when we get to
180:18 - the biggest screen size we need to
180:20 - change it once again so if you didn't do
180:22 - it the first time you can go ahead and
180:24 - bring in your own background image now
180:26 - at the next breakpoint
180:28 - all right so i'm going to copy that
180:30 - we're going to change this one up to a45
180:32 - and then we can come in here with the
180:33 - desktop
180:34 - and take a look at it so let's go and
180:37 - see if that worked
180:38 - and we're going to look at this in a
180:40 - little bit more detail but there we go
180:41 - perfect so we have it there for the
180:43 - smallest then we get to the next one and
180:45 - then it's going to break over and go to
180:47 - this
180:48 - and this is a situation where it's
180:51 - potentially possible that you'd want
180:53 - different media queries based on a
180:54 - landscape or portrait as well
180:57 - but because i'm really focused on screen
181:00 - width at the moment for when this is
181:02 - going from one column to two column when
181:04 - that happens and when it goes from one
181:06 - column here to two columns here i i
181:09 - really think it's important that we're
181:11 - switching from this image to this image
181:14 - because it's going to keep the text
181:15 - readable
181:17 - now we can see a little bit like
181:19 - something like this maybe this text is
181:20 - actually getting a little bit hard to
181:22 - read so maybe it's worth on this one
181:24 - actually changing the background
181:27 - position
181:28 - to the center center
181:31 - or to come in with a media query that's
181:34 - dealing with the orientation instead of
181:36 - the back uh instead of only the screen
181:38 - size but doing something like that will
181:40 - help fix the crop potentially so if
181:42 - where they're at a weird screen size
181:43 - it's not going to run in where the image
181:45 - is exploding at the top but if they're
181:47 - on a more of a tablet with a bigger
181:49 - screen everything should be perfect so i
181:51 - think that's a fine solution but if
181:52 - you'd rather play around and experiment
181:54 - with different media queries and see if
181:56 - you can get different effects i'd
181:57 - strongly encourage you to do that right
181:59 - now but i think for me and what i'm
182:01 - after this is actually working really
182:03 - well right now and i'm pretty happy with
182:05 - that and i'm pretty happy with this
182:06 - entire page and how it's looking right
182:08 - now with everything on it actually
182:10 - coming together really really nicely so
182:12 - now we need to be able to start working
182:14 - on our other pages and actually getting
182:16 - to other pages and well we can't do that
182:18 - because we don't have a navigation
182:19 - that's functioning so in the next
182:21 - lessons we're going to be diving in and
182:23 - fixing up our navigation
182:28 - alrighty time for the navigation which
182:30 - are always these little simple
182:31 - components that end up being more work
182:33 - than anything else on the entire page
182:35 - and this is we've already seen this
182:37 - version of it and so now we're going to
182:39 - be jumping into these ones instead with
182:41 - a hamburger menu that then has to open
182:43 - up and have
182:44 - this and then eventually at larger
182:46 - screen sizes turn into something that
182:47 - looks like that there's actually a
182:49 - middle ground as well that's a little
182:50 - bit different but for now we're just
182:52 - going to focus on setting up sort of the
182:54 - bare bones of everything we need in
182:56 - place then we'll focus on styling it for
182:58 - mobile and then we'll worry about what
183:00 - happens in the media queries after that
183:02 - so um if we go and look at what we
183:04 - already have and let's jump over to here
183:07 - we've already created some stuff and we
183:09 - already have some navigation stuff
183:11 - that's created in our css as well so
183:13 - we've done our primary navigation we
183:15 - have our underline indicators which are
183:17 - giving us those little underlying guides
183:18 - that we have here we have the numbers we
183:21 - have all of that set up but obviously
183:23 - and we also have this flex class on here
183:25 - just to give it a display of flex and
183:27 - then our active class that's on here we
183:29 - don't have to worry about that so much
183:31 - as we need to worry about getting them
183:34 - laid out properly here and you can see
183:35 - the active's not actually doing anything
183:37 - at mobile so there will be some changes
183:39 - that we do need to come in along the way
183:41 - on here so the very first thing i'm
183:42 - going to do before i even jump into the
183:44 - css and worry about styling things at
183:46 - all is we're going to make a few little
183:48 - changes here so in between my div and my
183:51 - nav here i am going to come in and add a
183:53 - button and this button is going to be
183:55 - what our hamburger menu is so close
183:58 - uh button
183:59 - and what we're going to put in the
184:00 - button we're going to write menu and
184:02 - this is a very standard type of thing to
184:04 - have in a button that is going to open
184:06 - and close a navigation menu is writing
184:08 - menu but we have a way to hide things
184:11 - that we've already seen we set up a
184:12 - class for that so if you can remember
184:14 - what it is to make that visually
184:15 - disappear you can go ahead and add that
184:17 - right now
184:19 - and so hopefully you remember there is a
184:21 - span class that is equal to
184:23 - sr only which we use when we set up our
184:26 - dot menus
184:27 - and then we can close
184:29 - that span right there so now we have a
184:33 - button that's there but it's visually
184:34 - hidden nobody can see the text inside
184:36 - but we can still access our button but
184:39 - for accessibility purposes that is a
184:41 - good thing we actually
184:43 - i'm doing small accessibility steps
184:45 - along the way right now we're going to
184:46 - have a future lesson that's going to go
184:47 - through the entire site later on and
184:49 - sort of fix up some of the other
184:51 - accessibility things such as the numbers
184:53 - that we have here but we'll worry about
184:54 - that a little bit later the other thing
184:56 - that we want to do with this button when
184:57 - you have something like this is you want
184:59 - to i think actually let's first give it
185:01 - a class because we need to you know be
185:02 - able to select it so we're going to call
185:04 - this my mobile nav toggle to just
185:07 - explain what it actually is
185:09 - and we're going to say that there it has
185:11 - an area controls and when you have a
185:13 - button like this that's controlling
185:14 - something else it's opening and closing
185:16 - my nav we want to say what it's doing
185:18 - for assistive technologies so this is a
185:21 - little bit more on the accessibility
185:23 - side and here i'm going to write primary
185:25 - navigation
185:27 - but if you do something like this so
185:29 - we're saying that this button is
185:30 - controlling my primary navigation it's
185:32 - not going to look at a class it's only
185:34 - going to look at an id so i am also
185:36 - going to add the id here
185:38 - on my ul right here and so when we click
185:41 - on this menu button it's going to
185:42 - control this it's going to open and
185:43 - close it and there's one more thing we
185:45 - can add on here as well which is area
185:48 - and we're gonna say area expanded equals
185:51 - false
185:52 - so right now we know that the menu is
185:54 - closed and if we push on the button then
185:56 - it will open and we're gonna have to use
185:57 - a bit of javascript to get that to
185:59 - actually work and now we've done
186:00 - everything we need to do to set the
186:02 - stage and to get things actually working
186:05 - so uh
186:06 - once again i'm gonna challenge you to go
186:08 - ahead and take as much as you you know
186:10 - go ahead and see if you can just get our
186:12 - navigation instead of it looking like
186:14 - what we see here to be horizontal to be
186:17 - positioned here and all of that take as
186:19 - much time as you want on it really work
186:21 - your way on it and then in the next
186:23 - video i'll come in and style it up so we
186:25 - can get it looking a little bit like
186:26 - this and then after that we'll look at
186:27 - adding the functionality of making it
186:29 - actually open and close
186:34 - alrighty so let's get this navigation
186:37 - actually working and we have our primary
186:38 - navigation we've already done a few
186:40 - things on it right here
186:41 - the first thing i'm going to do is
186:42 - actually delete this gap because it was
186:44 - big and it fit with our design system
186:46 - but it's way too big for what we want
186:47 - right now so i'm actually going to
186:48 - delete that from there and then we can
186:51 - come in and start doing a few things on
186:53 - it so the first thing i'm going to do is
186:54 - actually set the flex direction on here
186:56 - to be row instead of column um and
186:59 - actually it was row we want a column i
187:01 - always mix it up every single time there
187:03 - we go
187:04 - and now we can see that they're now
187:05 - stacking one on top of each other and
187:07 - look at my giant button
187:08 - but that's perfect they're stacking
187:10 - exactly what we want and actually it
187:11 - looks pretty close to what we need
187:13 - but obviously there's a few more changes
187:15 - that we want to do and another thing
187:16 - we're going to do on here as well is
187:18 - let's come in and give it a position
187:20 - a position of fixed just like that and
187:24 - when you do position fixed it's now like
187:27 - flowing outside of the flow so for the
187:29 - moment we'll give it a background that
187:30 - will change but we'll say background is
187:32 - uh let's do light
187:34 - green i think will not clash too much
187:36 - with this design and burn our eyes like
187:38 - coming in with a red or something might
187:40 - so there we go we can see that it's
187:41 - working but obviously we need it over
187:42 - here i'm going to show one of my
187:44 - favorite new new modern css properties
187:46 - which is inset which is a shorthand for
187:49 - top bottom left and right and it is a
187:51 - logical property and so i want it to be
187:53 - stuck to the top so zero offset on the
187:56 - so this is like saying top zero then i
187:58 - want to do my right of zero i want to
188:00 - say my bottom of zero and then we'll
188:01 - come in with like a twenty percent or so
188:03 - on this side now it looks gigantic but
188:05 - remember we're not going to have it
188:06 - there it's going to be mostly when we're
188:08 - at these screen sizes right here and
188:10 - it's going to then change after that so
188:12 - we can see that it's actually looking
188:14 - pretty good i think it's positioned
188:15 - where i want it to be but obviously it's
188:17 - going below the explore button there
188:18 - which does not look so good so one way
188:20 - that we can fix that is when we have a
188:22 - position we also have z indexes so we
188:25 - can use that and i'll come in with like
188:26 - just a big one that i'll probably never
188:28 - go above and usually a thousand for me
188:31 - is a very big z index so we can do that
188:33 - uh the next thing i'm going to do so we
188:35 - have position fixed we have a background
188:37 - let's add our let's change the padding
188:39 - we set padding in margin of zero uh
188:41 - three rem on the top and then
188:44 - two rem on the sides so if we go and
188:47 - take a look we can see it's given us our
188:48 - bigger space there no space on the sides
188:50 - and you know this light green is
188:51 - bothering me so let's change it to black
188:53 - just so we can actually read our text
188:55 - and see a little bit more of what's
188:56 - happening and there we go i think that's
188:57 - already pretty close to what we actually
189:00 - need this to be right here with a few
189:03 - obvious
189:04 - changes that need to happen
189:06 - so one of them is actually i think i'm
189:07 - going to increase my padding quite a bit
189:10 - on the top here and this is because i do
189:12 - want to come in with a big value but i
189:13 - don't want to risk any issues coming
189:15 - with overflows and stuff this could be a
189:17 - nice time to use another one we looked
189:18 - at how max could work but sometimes we
189:20 - want a minimum so let's say we do a
189:22 - minimum of six rem
189:24 - or if someone's on a really narrow say
189:26 - they're on a vertical display they've
189:28 - thrown it on their secondary monitor
189:30 - that's vertical and it's really tall you
189:32 - could also allow that margin or sorry
189:34 - that padding on the top to increase so
189:36 - here you could do like a 20vh and it's
189:38 - going to choose whichever of these two
189:40 - is the smaller value
189:43 - and actually i'm just now that i said
189:44 - that it's going to choose the smaller of
189:45 - the two so we can pump this one up to
189:48 - like a 20
189:49 - and then this one may be down to a 10
189:51 - and it's going to choose the smaller of
189:53 - them so if someone's on a really big big
189:55 - screen
189:56 - it's going to lock it and stop it from
189:57 - being more than 20 rem but it will allow
190:00 - it to grow and shrink with the viewport
190:02 - size so depending on it it's going to
190:04 - grow and shrink just a little bit it
190:05 - won't be a huge influence maybe we could
190:07 - pump that up to a 15 and take a bit of a
190:10 - design design decision on that so just
190:12 - depending on the screen real estate
190:14 - that's available
190:15 - there's a little bit of wiggle room if
190:17 - you want to play with that number with
190:18 - bigger numbers just you can see it
190:19 - working a little bit more go for it and
190:22 - then in a second i'll finish styling
190:24 - things up here so you could play around
190:26 - with that a little bit and then i'm
190:27 - gonna make one little tweak to the code
190:29 - i've written and then give you a
190:30 - challenge so i'll give you a second if
190:32 - you do want to play with that
190:33 - and for the challenge that i have for
190:35 - you um what i'm the one tweak that i
190:38 - mentioned i'm gonna do is i'm actually
190:40 - going to come and move most of this up
190:41 - into a media query media
190:43 - but i'm actually going to use a max
190:45 - max width instead of a min width which
190:47 - for me is very very rare
190:50 - but this is one of those types of
190:51 - situations where i actually think
190:54 - when you're doing navigations like this
190:56 - where you don't want to have to
190:57 - overwrite any of these things that
190:58 - you've done when you get to the larger
191:00 - screen size it makes a lot of sense for
191:02 - a lot of other things often you have
191:04 - less complexity that you're then adding
191:06 - complexity to when you get to bigger
191:07 - screen sizes so to me it makes a heck of
191:10 - a lot of sense in those situations to
191:12 - actually just be using a min width for
191:14 - everything but for something like this
191:16 - to me it makes a lot of sense to be
191:17 - using a max width so if we
191:20 - then we can take off this this this the
191:23 - background black uh the padding can come
191:27 - become zero again go back a little bit
191:29 - to my default and the flex
191:31 - direction can come off and of course if
191:33 - you do something like this don't leave
191:34 - your default selectors down here or they
191:37 - will overwrite your media query will
191:38 - come up keep your default styling first
191:41 - then come in with your
191:43 - media queries afterward and i'm actually
191:45 - going to boost this up to 30 from 20
191:47 - just because i think that the number on
191:49 - that's
191:50 - going to look a little bit nicer um just
191:52 - gives us a little bit more space on the
191:53 - side there
191:54 - and so yeah i'm pretty happy with that
191:56 - i'm going to ask you to do two things
191:58 - for the challenge to finish this one off
191:59 - one of them is to get rid of this
192:01 - underline on the active and the other
192:03 - one is going to be to bring you know we
192:05 - don't need this hover state we don't
192:06 - need any of that and the other thing is
192:08 - going to be to smush these together
192:10 - because they're very far apart here and
192:12 - if you look at the actual design they
192:13 - should be much closer together so uh i
192:16 - keep pushing this x to close the slide
192:19 - um so i'll let you go and try your hand
192:22 - at that i'll give you my solution to it
192:23 - and then we'll move on to finishing the
192:26 - styling of this in the next lesson after
192:27 - that
192:31 - alrighty so i hope that went well for
192:32 - you the first thing i'm going to do is
192:34 - get rid of that underline and there's
192:35 - multiple different ways we can do it and
192:38 - the one thing we do have to be aware of
192:39 - though is if we got rid of our
192:41 - underlying indicators everywhere that
192:43 - could actually cause a problem because
192:45 - we have the tabs that are going to come
192:46 - in later on that are using these
192:48 - underline indicators
192:50 - so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
192:52 - focus here where we already have this
192:54 - media query and this is again the max
192:56 - with media query where i think this
192:57 - makes the most sense to be working and
192:59 - i'm going to select my primary
193:00 - navigation
193:01 - and i'm also going to say when it has
193:04 - the underlying indicator on it and we
193:06 - don't actually need this extra
193:08 - specificity on here
193:10 - we could just choose the primary
193:11 - navigation because if we look at our
193:13 - index.html we have our primary
193:15 - navigation here which is our underline
193:18 - indicator so it is both of these
193:19 - together but we do have the underline
193:21 - indicators coming lower down in our css
193:24 - so that could always cause a problem
193:25 - with how the cascade is working but the
193:27 - other reason i really like doing it this
193:29 - way is
193:31 - first of all the extra specificity in
193:32 - this case is actually a good thing as
193:34 - far as i'm concerned we do want to avoid
193:37 - conflicts of specificity when we can but
193:40 - understanding how specificity works and
193:42 - knowing that a boost in specificity
193:44 - might give you a desired outcome it's
193:45 - not necessarily a negative to work with
193:48 - that specificity and work with how css
193:50 - is meant to be working so it's going to
193:52 - ensure that plus i think it's really
193:54 - really obvious what this is doing uh in
193:57 - this case is i'm changing how the
193:58 - underline indicators are working when
194:00 - they're applied to the primary
194:02 - navigation within this media query and
194:05 - so on that we can choose then our dot
194:06 - active and we can just say that it has a
194:09 - border of zero so if it is the active
194:12 - one then we get no border on there if we
194:14 - do this it will actually keep the hover
194:16 - effect on the other ones which to me if
194:18 - you're in a mobile device you're not
194:20 - going to see the hover effect anyway so
194:22 - it keeps the hover effect for somebody
194:24 - who is just they put their screen really
194:25 - small on the side they're not using a
194:27 - full width screen and it happened to
194:29 - kick in their media query so i don't
194:30 - think that's a problem if you like the
194:32 - idea of just not having one you could
194:34 - actually put the star here because the
194:36 - border zero is going to just disable the
194:38 - border completely and now we won't have
194:40 - any sort of hover effect at all uh but
194:43 - i'm gonna stick with having one on there
194:45 - just so we have a little bit of a a
194:46 - little something for somebody who might
194:48 - be on a smaller screen who is on a
194:50 - desktop computer that just shrunk their
194:52 - browser window into the corner somewhere
194:54 - the other thing we want to do is change
194:55 - the spacing and you'll notice here i
194:57 - actually left the underline gap here as
194:59 - well as having it within here so i could
195:01 - actually come in and maybe set a 0 or a
195:03 - 1 ram or i think in this case about a
195:05 - point five will match the design pretty
195:08 - good so we still can keep our effect uh
195:10 - like that if you removed the border
195:12 - completely and you decided to go with
195:14 - having a zero here uh and not just with
195:16 - the active the spacing might be slightly
195:18 - different so maybe you'd want to tweak
195:19 - it but again a nice thing with these
195:22 - custom properties is you don't even have
195:23 - to remember how you made this gap
195:25 - originally we just know that we can very
195:27 - easily modify that underlying gap and
195:29 - that's one of the reasons i really think
195:30 - custom properties are absolutely amazing
195:32 - these locally scoped ones are something
195:34 - that people don't take enough advantage
195:36 - of
195:37 - so there we have it there is my solution
195:39 - if you took a different way and it
195:40 - worked that is perfectly fine as well
195:43 - but just i was trying to do it in a way
195:45 - that would make sure that it's only for
195:47 - the primary navigation underline
195:48 - indicators and not for everything that
195:50 - would be the most important thing here
195:52 - with whatever solution you did come up
195:54 - with
195:58 - all right so this background effect is
195:59 - really cool and it's actually pretty
196:00 - popular these days um it sort of
196:02 - exploded for a while and i think it's
196:04 - slowed down a bit but in this situation
196:05 - i think it just looks fantastic so hats
196:07 - off to front end mentor for her uh how
196:09 - good it looks and this is using
196:11 - something um the style is called
196:14 - glass morphism and it sort of gives you
196:16 - that look of looking through frosted
196:18 - glass and luckily we can do that with
196:20 - css now
196:21 - and it's actually pretty easy to do the
196:24 - browser support for it is increasing but
196:26 - it's not perfect as of the time of
196:27 - recording
196:28 - with the only major browser that doesn't
196:30 - currently support it is firefox and it
196:32 - is behind a flag there so it shouldn't
196:34 - be too long but we're going to look at
196:35 - how we can deal with that um when
196:36 - browsers don't support it so it won't be
196:39 - something that causes any issues and i
196:41 - think even i think i saw it working in
196:42 - nightly the other day so i think it
196:44 - should be not too long until firefox
196:46 - does support it anyway
196:47 - uh but the first thing and actually we
196:49 - can leave black but i'm gonna i want to
196:50 - lower the opacity on this so uh we have
196:53 - our our nice hsl's that we've already
196:55 - created and actually it's already it's
196:56 - going to be white um so i'm going to
196:58 - drop it down to like a really faded out
197:00 - white for the moment and we can take a
197:02 - look at what that's looking like so we
197:03 - have a faded out white background
197:05 - and um actually we need this background
197:08 - it's going to have to be on everything
197:09 - because this is going to be the same
197:11 - look whether we have it on the side here
197:13 - or you can see it's the same effect over
197:15 - here
197:16 - so what i want to do is come and put
197:17 - that background right here
197:19 - and now i want to challenge you to look
197:21 - it up i told you it's called
197:22 - glossomorphism i told you we can do it
197:24 - with css so if you already know how to
197:26 - do it or maybe you've heard about it you
197:27 - saw something a while ago try it out and
197:29 - if you've never heard of it before do a
197:31 - little google search see if you can find
197:33 - the solution and implement it before i
197:34 - show you how to do it and then if you
197:37 - get stuck or you just want to compare
197:38 - notes to how i do it i'll be showing my
197:40 - solution in just a few seconds
197:44 - alrighty so to get this to work we use a
197:47 - a property i was going to say function
197:49 - but it's a property called backdrop
197:50 - filter and with that we alter filter and
197:53 - with that we use the blur function and
197:55 - then we just have to come in and say how
197:56 - much we want to blur things and we have
197:58 - to put a value in so i'm going to say
197:59 - one rem and just see what it looks like
198:00 - you already see it third let's go look
198:02 - and hey you know what one ram looks
198:03 - pretty close to what we have there um so
198:05 - not too shabby and you i you know and we
198:08 - can see it's already working up here too
198:10 - and we have to finish styling that to
198:12 - make it look where it needs to go but
198:14 - the effect is working all around you can
198:16 - tweak the number here so like if you did
198:18 - a pure white background it's not going
198:19 - to do anything it really relies on you
198:21 - having a transparent background and then
198:23 - it shows you so i mean you could come in
198:25 - with zero you don't even need to have
198:27 - any color on here whatsoever and it will
198:29 - blur it
198:30 - so if you do come in with a color it
198:32 - does need to have like an opacity to it
198:34 - you can't have a pure color so just be
198:36 - careful with that i do think the point
198:38 - one was actually a little bit strong i'm
198:39 - going to come in with a 0.2
198:41 - maybe a 0.5
198:43 - something very minor to try and match
198:45 - theirs and maybe we could even increase
198:47 - this blur a little bit because they look
198:48 - like they really blurred things
198:50 - and it might not match the figma design
198:52 - perfectly but we can get awfully close
198:54 - to what um was provided for and you know
198:57 - what i think that's looking pretty much
198:59 - bang on it's such a cool effect it looks
199:01 - really good and again it's working here
199:03 - we just need to fix that but um yeah i
199:05 - think it's looking fantastic it's a
199:07 - really fun effect and you can play
199:09 - around with it tweak it try different
199:10 - color combinations just to see what it
199:12 - looks like and then when you're ready
199:13 - we'll go on to the next lesson where
199:15 - we'll look at how we can deal with
199:16 - browser support
199:19 - all right so this is looking good if
199:21 - you're in any browser that does support
199:23 - it and if you're in firefox it would
199:25 - instead of looking like that it's
199:26 - currently looking like this because
199:28 - backdrop filter is not supported and
199:30 - that means that the navigation actually
199:31 - is unreadable we can't see anything
199:33 - that's going on there with all this
199:35 - overlapping and everything so what i'm
199:37 - actually going to do is fix what here
199:39 - let's let's set this up as a default
199:40 - which is going to look good so i'm going
199:42 - to boost this up to like in maybe we'll
199:45 - try seven five on the opacity and let's
199:47 - change this to our dark so we still get
199:49 - sort of this transparent effect and
199:51 - actually maybe even go up to an eight
199:53 - five or
199:54 - even maybe a point nine
199:56 - uh could look really good so yeah we
199:58 - still get like this transparent effect
200:00 - coming in it doesn't look as nice but at
200:02 - least we're getting a workable
200:03 - experience we can read our text and all
200:05 - of that maybe even a 9.5 would be better
200:07 - because i'm really want to make sure
200:09 - that the contrast is high enough to make
200:10 - the menu really easy to read
200:13 - and then what we can do is come down
200:14 - here and do it at supports
200:16 - and if you want to give this a try i can
200:18 - do ad supports like this and you can go
200:20 - ahead and research it and see if you can
200:22 - get this working
200:23 - where if the browser supports backdrop
200:26 - filter blur then we get the effect with
200:28 - the background that we wanted and if it
200:30 - doesn't well then it's going to use this
200:32 - default that we've assigned right here
200:34 - so go ahead research that it's not too
200:36 - difficult to do and then once you figure
200:38 - that out i'll show you my solution
200:42 - all right so for add supports what you
200:44 - want to do is bring in a property value
200:46 - pair so i'm going to copy what we've
200:47 - already have here and drop it right
200:48 - there and it is very important to both
200:50 - the property and the value as well and
200:52 - the value here could be anything like we
200:54 - could even put zero ram as long as it's
200:56 - a valid value that we're putting here it
200:58 - will work and that's because it needs
201:00 - the property and the value because some
201:02 - browsers will support a property but may
201:04 - not support certain values or of course
201:06 - sometimes it just doesn't support the
201:07 - property at all before add supports to
201:09 - work you need to have both the property
201:11 - and the value if you only put the
201:12 - property it's not going to work and then
201:14 - we can come in with my primary
201:16 - navigation and just get what we had
201:18 - before so i'll copy this right here
201:21 - paste it in add the blur back in and
201:26 - and then come change this back to the
201:28 - point zero five i think i had it as and
201:31 - then change this back to my color white
201:33 - and if you're in chrome you should see
201:35 - it working nicely and again if the
201:37 - browser doesn't support it this whole
201:38 - thing comes out and at least they get a
201:40 - workable experience
201:42 - so this is a nice way to add in cool
201:45 - features and to provide a fallback and
201:47 - it works so well and it's really easy to
201:49 - do
201:53 - can you believe how long we've been at
201:54 - this and we haven't had to write a line
201:55 - of javascript yet uh but here we are
201:57 - we're going to have to get some to
201:58 - actually get our button working but not
202:00 - yet we still need a little bit of css uh
202:02 - to get our button in the right spot so
202:04 - what i'm going to do is just a little
202:06 - bit of styling then see if i can get you
202:08 - to get the the icon in there and then
202:11 - we'll go from there to add in the
202:13 - functionality of everything so if we go
202:16 - and take a look at our index we do have
202:18 - our button that is right here and i did
202:20 - give it the class of mobile nav toggle
202:24 - so what i'm going to do is actually say
202:26 - right here that my mobile
202:28 - nav
202:30 - toggle is a display of none so it
202:34 - disappears when we're well just
202:35 - disappears right now because i don't
202:37 - want it when we're at large screen sizes
202:39 - and display if none will pull it
202:41 - completely out of the dom so it's not
202:42 - something that like an assistive
202:44 - technology or anything like that will
202:45 - run into but when we're here we really
202:47 - need that button so then what we can do
202:49 - is within this media query we can come
202:51 - in and turn that
202:53 - mobile nav toggle back on by saying
202:56 - display block you can also then position
202:58 - it position absolute because we need it
203:00 - to be wherever we want it to be uh we're
203:02 - going to come in with a z index and i
203:04 - said a thousand is really big we're
203:05 - going to go with the 2000 now because we
203:07 - need it to be on top of our primary
203:09 - navigation and now we just need it to be
203:11 - in the right spot so i'm going to say
203:12 - what right of one rem and we'll do a top
203:15 - of two ram just so we can actually start
203:18 - seeing it come in we can see that it's
203:19 - actually in the right spot
203:21 - uh what we do want though is a
203:22 - background of you can put background
203:25 - none background transparent background
203:26 - zero they all work i'll use transparent
203:28 - just so it disappears it's a button so
203:30 - we also want to say it is a border of
203:32 - zero on here and now we need to actually
203:35 - see the icon and you know our button is
203:38 - there it actually exists but we can't
203:40 - see it and so i'm gonna you know what
203:42 - how how could we get the button to be in
203:44 - there without placing it in our html
203:47 - because we have our menu text here so we
203:48 - don't actually want to come and place
203:49 - the image here so bringing it in with
203:51 - our css rather than uh placing it in the
203:54 - html makes sense so go ahead place it
203:56 - there right now and then i'll come and
203:58 - take a look at that in a second
204:01 - all right so i'm gonna do it with a nice
204:03 - background image that's it background
204:05 - image and if you didn't get it you might
204:07 - have been overthinking things and so
204:09 - we're gonna go from our route into our
204:11 - assets into our shared into our icon
204:14 - hamburger.svg
204:16 - and if you just did that you would have
204:18 - seen it come in but we can't really see
204:19 - it um so what i'm going to do and i sort
204:21 - of want this to be a nice little square
204:22 - that people can click on so let's give
204:25 - this a width of 1.5 ram and give it a i
204:29 - won't give it a height i'm going to give
204:30 - it an aspect ratio
204:33 - of one
204:34 - which should give us the right sizing
204:36 - and we can see that it's come in but it
204:38 - looks kind of funky um and that could be
204:41 - because it's a background image so i'm
204:42 - going to try one thing here with a
204:44 - background
204:45 - in it a background repeat
204:48 - no repeat just to make sure
204:50 - there we go that's what it was it was
204:52 - the image was repeating itself downward
204:54 - and we were getting an extra thick bar
204:56 - on the bottom so we have that in place
204:59 - and now obviously what we want is this
205:02 - whole guy should actually be hidden away
205:03 - when we click that it slides in yeah so
205:07 - what we're going to do here on my
205:08 - primary navigation is add in a transform
205:10 - of a translate x
205:13 - and on my translate x we can say 100 and
205:15 - it's vanished and it's moved 100 of
205:18 - itself away off to the side and it
205:21 - actually i see we're getting an overflow
205:23 - when i hover i thought we'd actually get
205:25 - an overflow when i did that
205:27 - and i was waiting for this point to do
205:29 - an overflow of hidden so this is one on
205:31 - this site so we can come all the way up
205:34 - and just so when things start moving
205:35 - around and we start animating there is a
205:37 - good chance that there is some overflow
205:39 - that does happen so i'm going to go
205:42 - uh here on my body and we can just say
205:44 - that the overflow
205:47 - x is hidden
205:48 - uh because it is possible that some
205:51 - scrolling will come in uh when we click
205:53 - and it should slide our menu open and so
205:57 - that means we need to come in and start
205:58 - writing some javascript if you're not
206:00 - familiar with javascript don't worry i
206:01 - will be giving solutions to it but if
206:03 - you are familiar with javascript i would
206:05 - recommend you seeing if you can come in
206:06 - with a way to get it to slide in and
206:08 - slide out and if you're able to also get
206:11 - it to change the background image so you
206:13 - can come right here and start doing that
206:14 - you will have to go into your css
206:15 - potentially to add some extra classes
206:17 - and do some stuff in there and just to
206:19 - get the transitions working and all of
206:21 - that and when you're done with you might
206:23 - even need to go to the html maybe add a
206:25 - few little things there and when you're
206:26 - done with that you go to the next lesson
206:28 - to see how i complete this or if you
206:30 - don't know at all where to start with
206:32 - this and you want a few hints and tips
206:33 - along the way we'll be looking at that
206:35 - in the next lesson
206:40 - all right so we can start writing some
206:41 - javascript now so i'm going to delete
206:42 - this comment from here and before we
206:44 - even get started on this i'm going to go
206:45 - over to my index and i'm going to come
206:48 - up to the top and you might hear that
206:49 - you should keep your javascript at the
206:50 - bottom and i'm going to come here and
206:52 - what i'm going to do is link to our
206:53 - javascript um so it's script src is
206:56 - equal to and index.js
206:59 - and i'm just going to come in here with
207:00 - a differ
207:01 - um just like that and then click close
207:04 - script or not click but write close
207:06 - script and everything should be
207:08 - perfectly fine here um the deferred here
207:10 - just lets us keep our script at the top
207:12 - so we can have everything here but it
207:14 - will defer the loading of the javascript
207:16 - until the page has been loaded and now
207:18 - we can go in and start writing some
207:20 - javascript and so what do we want to do
207:22 - well we want when someone
207:25 - clicks the hamburger hamburger menu
207:29 - if the menu
207:31 - is closed open it
207:34 - if the menu is open close it
207:37 - and we need to with those also change
207:39 - the icons or the symbol you know we want
207:41 - to change it to the x and back and forth
207:43 - but for a very simple thing this is
207:45 - basically what we want to do
207:46 - so when someone clicks on the hamburger
207:48 - menu we want to the hamburger button i
207:50 - should say or the hamburger menu
207:52 - if the menu is closed open it if the
207:54 - menu is open closed all right so that
207:56 - means we need two things in our
207:57 - javascript we need our hamburger button
207:59 - i shouldn't write the hamburger button
208:02 - and we need to find our navigation so if
208:04 - the nav is open or closed instead of
208:06 - menu would probably be better
208:08 - so if we need those two things so first
208:10 - let's come in and say uh we'll get the
208:12 - nav itself so const nav and this is a
208:15 - name that i'm making up if you're not
208:16 - familiar with javascript uh const is
208:19 - just a way to store things so i'm gonna
208:21 - go into my document and do a query
208:23 - selector
208:25 - and we're going to select my primary
208:27 - navigation
208:29 - and we're also going to do a const for
208:32 - my nav toggle which is my button and so
208:34 - we need to find that one as well
208:36 - and now we have both of them that we can
208:38 - access and do something with
208:40 - so the first thing is when somebody
208:42 - clicks on the hamburger menu so how can
208:44 - we do that well the hamburger menu is my
208:46 - nav toggle so we're going to start there
208:48 - and we need to add an event listener and
208:51 - an event listener we're listening for an
208:52 - event that's going to happen and what
208:54 - are we looking for well we're looking
208:56 - for a click
208:57 - and if somebody clicks on it we want to
208:59 - do something and so this is an arrow
209:02 - function so we have our nav toggle which
209:04 - is our button and if somebody clicks on
209:06 - that we want to do something so now what
209:08 - we need to do is check if the nav is
209:10 - open or closed and the thing is we don't
209:12 - really have a way to check for that
209:13 - right now
209:15 - so there are different approaches to
209:17 - this sometimes you see a class nav
209:19 - opened or nav closed and you can check
209:20 - if that class is there toggle a class or
209:22 - something like that
209:24 - but when we're you writing javascript i
209:26 - prefer using data attributes which allow
209:29 - me to hook in and sort of be you know
209:31 - that i know that my classes are for
209:33 - styling and then i know that my data
209:35 - attributes are for javascript and it
209:37 - sort of just lets me hook in that way
209:40 - so we have my primary navigation right
209:42 - here which is what we've selected right
209:44 - here and this is what we want to check
209:46 - we want to see is it opened or is it
209:47 - closed
209:48 - so on that primary navigation that we
209:50 - have right here i'm going to add the
209:52 - data visible is equal to false
209:56 - because right now it's it's not visible
209:59 - we can't see it and if you haven't used
210:01 - data attributes before these are
210:03 - attributes that you get to invent
210:04 - they're your own ones you can write
210:06 - anything you want uh just it's prefixed
210:08 - with data and you could have like
210:10 - visible you know you could even have it
210:11 - like is
210:13 - this the z bowl if you wanted to but
210:14 - then you're you know we're just getting
210:16 - a little long so i'm just going to say
210:17 - data visible is equal to false so
210:20 - visible is equal to false then we can go
210:23 - back into here and we can use that now
210:25 - so what we can do is we can check for
210:27 - that visibility first so we can say
210:30 - visibility
210:31 - is equal to
210:33 - and now before i was doing a document
210:34 - query selector because i was looking
210:36 - through the whole document to find my
210:38 - primary navigation but now we already
210:40 - have my nav so i can choose my nav so
210:42 - i'm doing nav dot and i can look for
210:45 - things like the attribute so i can get
210:46 - the attribute that's on there and what
210:48 - attribute do we want well we want our
210:50 - data visible and why don't we see what
210:52 - that's going to give us by doing a
210:53 - console log so console.log and we can
210:56 - console.log our visibility
210:59 - that we just created
211:01 - so when we click on this we see false
211:04 - because every time we click on it we'll
211:05 - get a false or we can even open our
211:07 - console here and you can see all the
211:09 - falses that are coming in and every time
211:11 - i click on it we'll get another false
211:13 - that pops up because that's what our
211:15 - visibility is currently false so we know
211:17 - that's working all right so if the nat
211:19 - so we know now that it's working uh and
211:21 - that we're getting false so if it is
211:23 - closed we want to open it so the first
211:25 - thing we can do is we want to start with
211:26 - if
211:27 - so we can say if visibility is equal to
211:31 - uh false and i'm putting this in
211:33 - quotations because um the data when
211:36 - we're getting the data attributes it's
211:37 - not going to return a boolean it will
211:39 - return it as a string so if the
211:41 - visibility is equal to false what do we
211:44 - want to do well we want to do one thing
211:46 - which is going to be nav and we can
211:48 - actually change the attribute now so nav
211:51 - set attribute of that
211:56 - and we can change that over to true and
211:59 - now we can test to see if this is
212:01 - actually working because we have that
212:03 - set up so let's go over and click on it
212:05 - and it's false so now when i click it
212:07 - should say true and it does so we can
212:10 - see that it's working we're going back
212:11 - and forth between true
212:13 - and false or actually we're not going
212:14 - back and forth we set it to true and
212:16 - that's it and so yeah we need to be able
212:18 - to set it back so right now we're saying
212:20 - if it was if it was not visible so if
212:23 - the visibility is false we're going to
212:24 - set the visibility to true
212:26 - else we want to do the the opposite
212:29 - right so then we want to take this and
212:32 - set it to false
212:33 - so let's do false here and what that
212:36 - means is it should now go back and forth
212:38 - false true false true and now we can
212:40 - actually see it's rotating between them
212:41 - every time we click so that is perfect
212:44 - so i don't think we need our comments in
212:46 - here anymore i think it's pretty and we
212:47 - already got that
212:49 - the one issue now is we actually needed
212:51 - to open and close
212:53 - so there are different ways we could do
212:55 - this but we might as well we have our
212:57 - data visible here and the data visible
212:59 - is switching between true and false so
213:01 - that means we can come into our css and
213:03 - we can actually change that
213:05 - so then on here with my primary
213:07 - navigation we can add in primary nav
213:11 - irrigation and we can add an attribute
213:14 - on here and so we can check to see if
213:16 - the data visible is equal to
213:21 - is equal to true
213:23 - then we can do a transform
213:26 - of translate x and go back to zero
213:29 - and let's go and take a look and see if
213:31 - it's working and look at that it opens
213:33 - and closes just like that
213:37 - now what i'm going to do first is i'm
213:39 - going to delete this console log
213:40 - visibility because it's going to be a
213:41 - little bit annoying and then i'm going
213:43 - to give you a challenge because there's
213:44 - a few things that we need to tweak on it
213:46 - still so it's working but it doesn't
213:47 - look very nice when it opens and closes
213:50 - so i'm going to challenge you to get it
213:51 - to look a little nicer by sliding on out
213:54 - and sliding on back in and of course we
213:56 - need to change our our icon here from
213:59 - this hamburger over to an x so why don't
214:01 - you go in here do what you can to get
214:03 - those to work make it look a little bit
214:05 - nicer and then when you're ready you can
214:06 - go on to the next lesson where i'll be
214:07 - looking at my solution for both of those
214:13 - all right so we'll start with the
214:14 - easiest one first which is adding our
214:15 - animation so here where i had my
214:17 - transform i'm going to add in a nice
214:19 - little transition and transform 500
214:22 - milliseconds ease in out and that's the
214:25 - nice easy one to do so if we come and
214:27 - take a look now we should see that it
214:29 - slides on out and slides on in and i
214:32 - think that looks pretty nice when that
214:33 - happens so i'm pretty happy with that
214:35 - and that was the easy part now is the
214:37 - little bit of a harder part because we
214:38 - want to change the icon on this one when
214:41 - it opens
214:43 - to the x and to do that we actually need
214:45 - to jump into our javascript and make an
214:47 - improvement there or maybe you came up
214:48 - and you might have added a something
214:50 - else but we need something on this that
214:52 - can inform it of when the menu is open
214:54 - and closed and if we come and look in
214:57 - our
214:58 - html here we have a button and on there
215:00 - we have our area expanded is equal to
215:02 - false and remember this area is for
215:04 - accessibility reasons so it's really
215:06 - important when that menu opens that this
215:08 - area expanded should equal to true so if
215:11 - you got stuck and you just weren't sure
215:12 - where to do it that doesn't mean the
215:14 - first thing we need to do is come into
215:16 - our javascript and make a change in here
215:18 - so we can toggle the area attribute and
215:20 - set it from true to false so if you're
215:22 - feeling confident you can jump in here
215:24 - if you're not confident but you want to
215:25 - give it a shot i'll give you a hint in
215:26 - just one second
215:29 - all right and that hint is we already
215:31 - did this with our nav and we were
215:32 - setting the attribute on it and here we
215:34 - have our nav toggle and on our nav
215:36 - toggle that is here in our html which is
215:39 - our button itself so this button has an
215:42 - attribute that we want to be changing so
215:44 - the same way we were changing an
215:45 - attribute for our nav i want you to take
215:47 - that and change the attribute for the
215:49 - nav toggle
215:52 - all right so nav toggle and we can say
215:54 - that we want to set the attribute and in
215:57 - this case it's not my data visible it's
215:59 - the area expanded
216:01 - and we want to set that to true
216:03 - and then
216:05 - i've been using semicolons so i'll keep
216:07 - using them and then here we'll come in
216:09 - and we can switch this over to be false
216:12 - and just to double check that it's
216:13 - actually working let's add a console log
216:15 - once again console.log
216:17 - of course if you're in a if you're not
216:19 - in scrimba but you're doing this in your
216:20 - own editor you can also just check in
216:23 - the dom to see if it's being changed in
216:26 - there and so here we'll do our nav
216:28 - toggle dot get attribute and we want to
216:31 - get our area
216:32 - expanded um
216:35 - yeah that's all we need so let's try
216:37 - that out and it's true because it's open
216:40 - and now it's false because it's closed
216:42 - so i know that it's working properly and
216:44 - i can delete my console log and now what
216:46 - i can do is use that and use the fact
216:49 - that that's toggling to hook into there
216:52 - in my css to get the icon to change so
216:55 - if you took a different approach before
216:56 - or if you were just completely stuck and
216:58 - unsure of the next steps to take now
216:59 - maybe you have a better idea why don't
217:01 - you try and get that icon to change and
217:03 - then i'll show you the solution in just
217:04 - one second
217:07 - alrighty so let's come in here and what
217:09 - i want to do is choose my mobile nav
217:11 - toggle and do the attribute selector
217:14 - just like before with my area
217:16 - expanded
217:18 - is equal to true
217:19 - and when that is true we want to change
217:22 - the background image right here so this
217:23 - doesn't mean there's no animation on it
217:25 - because you can't animate background
217:26 - images and this would be icon close i
217:29 - believe
217:30 - or is it closed oh it is closed there we
217:32 - go and we can see that it is working and
217:35 - that's pretty cool now there's one other
217:37 - tweak we can make in here um which is
217:39 - the outline that appears on this just
217:41 - because there's a little a thing that
217:43 - bothers me when we have buttons like
217:45 - this that we interact with and then it
217:46 - leaves the selector the sort of the
217:49 - weird blue outline
217:50 - even though the outlines have been
217:51 - changed recently
217:53 - but to do that what we'll do is let's
217:55 - just say down here we'll do mobile and
217:58 - i'm going to choose focus just to show
218:00 - you what this is going to do and then
218:01 - we're going to change the focus to
218:03 - something else and we're going to use
218:04 - this on a few other things throughout
218:05 - the site too
218:06 - and let's give this an outline and i'm
218:08 - going to say 5 pixels solid red and
218:10 - we're going to change it later
218:11 - solid red but the red will make it stand
218:14 - out for this demo and then we can see an
218:16 - outline offset
218:18 - of 5 pixels too just so it's not
218:20 - touching the button directly on it
218:22 - and so now when i click on it and we get
218:24 - that select you can see it's
218:25 - highlighting it which is that's fine
218:28 - one actually change really fast i'm
218:30 - going to make here is background
218:31 - position
218:32 - of center center or the center one time
218:35 - i had this so when i click on that it
218:36 - did the icon is actually perfectly in
218:38 - the center of the button so it looks a
218:40 - little better so you can see when i
218:41 - click on it it highlights it with the
218:43 - red and then the red is still there and
218:45 - i am in the scrimba editor so it's
218:46 - possible uh you're not seeing it so you
218:48 - can just pause the video and play with
218:50 - it a little bit to see that
218:51 - and see the red coming in on there and
218:54 - what i want instead of using focus is
218:56 - actually using focus visible
218:59 - and what the focus visible does it's
219:01 - sort of what you wanted focus to be the
219:03 - entire time so if i come in and i push
219:05 - tab it's actually going to highlight it
219:07 - and i'm going to get it and then i can
219:08 - push my button and i know that's what's
219:10 - selected so i'm pushing
219:13 - right so i'm using my keyboard to open
219:14 - and close it which is perfectly fine i
219:16 - can tab now onto these other guys and
219:18 - tab back through them and i can see that
219:20 - that's what's being selected but if i
219:22 - click on it i don't get the big red box
219:25 - uh it's so nice and makes me so happy
219:27 - and again you might not be seeing this
219:29 - as you're watching it through the
219:30 - scrimba replay that i have here so just
219:33 - hit pause and play with it yourself in
219:35 - your own editor whether it's the
219:36 - scribble editor or you're doing it in
219:38 - your own browser and you'll definitely
219:39 - see the difference between the two i
219:41 - just think it's a nice little touch that
219:42 - we can add so we still keep our focus
219:44 - state but we don't have it coming in
219:45 - when it doesn't look too fantastic and
219:47 - of course we can then change this over
219:49 - from being red to white just so it looks
219:52 - a little bit nicer than a red box that's
219:54 - just showing up on our site and yeah i
219:56 - think that is looking pretty good
220:01 - all right so it's time to finish up our
220:02 - navigation we've almost got it done here
220:04 - and then at the larger screen sizes we
220:06 - have some other styling differences that
220:07 - are going to come into it
220:09 - so you can actually see it the smallest
220:10 - one we have our numbers which then
220:12 - disappear at the next screen size up
220:14 - then we have our spacing here which that
220:16 - we have none of here but where we push
220:17 - things down a little bit at the larger
220:19 - screen size and then we also get this
220:21 - interesting line here which looks very
220:23 - simple and may prove not to be
220:26 - as a little bit of foreshadowing there
220:28 - so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
220:31 - start with my logo then i'm going to
220:33 - worry about this part here we'll get all
220:35 - of that done in this video and with a
220:37 - couple of challenges for you along the
220:38 - way and then in future videos we'll come
220:40 - and finish everything up at the largest
220:42 - screen sizes
220:43 - and the reason i want to start with my
220:45 - logo is just right now where our logo is
220:47 - stuck to the side here and we need to
220:49 - obviously move it off of there and it's
220:51 - something we haven't done yet so i'm
220:53 - going to scroll up a little bit here so
220:55 - here we have my primary navigation and
220:57 - what i'm actually going to do is create
220:58 - a comment here just to say these are all
221:00 - part of my primary primary header
221:03 - uh because we have our navigation we
221:05 - have our toggle and we have our logo
221:07 - here and so for the logo we can choose
221:09 - it if you remember we had a dot logo
221:11 - that we used so we need to move this
221:12 - down and off the left side of the page a
221:14 - little bit so if you want to give this a
221:16 - try you can go ahead and try it out
221:20 - and i'm going to say that the margin
221:22 - here is 2 rim and it's not exactly
221:25 - matching the design files that we have
221:27 - the margin at smaller screen sizes is
221:29 - actually smaller than this uh both the
221:31 - distance off the top and off to the side
221:33 - where it's actually 24 pixels instead of
221:35 - the 32 that i have it at now and then at
221:38 - the large screen size version and the
221:40 - space on the left side here actually
221:41 - gets as big as 55 and so my challenge to
221:44 - you is we've looked at a few modern css
221:45 - functions that let us do interesting
221:47 - things with sizes and so can you think
221:49 - of a way to set either a minimum a
221:51 - maximum maybe a minimum and maximum
221:53 - space
221:54 - on the sides for your margin here so i'm
221:55 - gonna actually delete that and let you
221:57 - give that a try and to play around with
221:58 - it a little bit and then i'll see you
222:00 - with my solution in just a few seconds
222:04 - all right so uh there's a few different
222:06 - things you could have used a min a max
222:09 - or a clamp for these i'm going to come
222:11 - in with a clamp for now uh just to
222:13 - explore this so it lets us set a minimum
222:15 - like i said so we know that the minimum
222:17 - we wanted was one point five the mat
222:19 - then we can have a middle value which
222:21 - i'll talk about in a second and the
222:22 - maximum that we want was 55 pixels which
222:24 - is a little bit smaller than 3.5 rem and
222:28 - so we can do something like that and
222:29 - then have the middle value here be
222:31 - something like 10 viewport width and
222:34 - then 10 might actually be a lot let's
222:36 - try 5 viewport width and then what that
222:38 - means is it can't get smaller than this
222:40 - it can it will grow by this much and
222:43 - then it maxes out at that space
222:45 - so if we take a look the space you can
222:47 - see it's actually moving down and across
222:49 - and then it's moving back in and uh
222:53 - not a huge fan of that the way it's
222:54 - working right now but at least we can
222:56 - see that it is working and what i'm
222:58 - actually going to do is split this up
223:00 - where my top and bottom values i'm just
223:02 - going to give them a solid 2 ram so they
223:04 - don't move up and down
223:06 - and i will allow it to grow left and
223:09 - right though and for me that works a lot
223:12 - better so you can see that it is growing
223:13 - left and right but the spacing
223:16 - on the top and the bottom isn't changing
223:18 - which just looks a lot nicer um so we'll
223:21 - bring that down to a 1.5 so it's the
223:23 - same as in the the mobile design just
223:25 - because now you can see it's up a little
223:26 - bit higher
223:27 - and we can fix that as we go
223:29 - um so that is with clamp if you did
223:31 - something instead with a min or a max
223:33 - that would be perfectly fine and you
223:35 - could experiment with those to get
223:36 - something that you want i'll stick with
223:38 - just this here because it works really
223:40 - well uh you'll also note i didn't do
223:41 - like a plus one rem here like i did for
223:44 - type my typography
223:45 - so with typography viewport units don't
223:47 - zoom if you're zooming in and out on
223:49 - your browser because they're linked to
223:51 - the size of the viewport and if
223:52 - somebody's zooming in it's probably
223:54 - because they want the text to be bigger
223:55 - for the layout itself and for the
223:57 - positioning of the logo i don't mind if
223:58 - it doesn't shift or move around if
224:00 - somebody's zooming in or out so here i'm
224:02 - leaving the middle value just like that
224:03 - the next thing i'm going to do is i'm
224:05 - before we even get into a media query
224:07 - now what i want to do is fix my layout
224:09 - at this point this shouldn't affect our
224:10 - layout at the smallest screen sizes that
224:12 - we'll double check to make sure but i'm
224:13 - going to choose my primary header and
224:16 - what i want to do now is i want to
224:17 - ensure that this is pushed all the way
224:20 - over to that side and then my logo is
224:22 - actually centered within this space here
224:24 - so with that selected uh one thing is we
224:26 - already have a display of flex on here
224:28 - we gave the primary header a flex class
224:31 - so we don't need to declare a display
224:32 - flex but i'll let you come in and try
224:34 - and space them out
224:38 - all right so hopefully that went well
224:40 - for you so i'm going to do a justify
224:41 - content space between on here which will
224:44 - space them out and i will do an align
224:46 - items of center and if we go to our
224:49 - small screen sizes you can see that the
224:50 - layout here hasn't been affected
224:52 - by it at all everything is working just
224:54 - fine and then we go up to our big screen
224:57 - size we can see that it's working
225:00 - the last thing that we need to do now is
225:02 - to fix the padding here and over here
225:05 - where we don't have any so for that one
225:07 - i am going to do it in a media query and
225:09 - let's come down we already have a max
225:11 - width of 35 rem here so i'm going to
225:13 - come all the way down outside of that
225:15 - and i'm actually going to move these two
225:17 - up here
225:20 - i'm just to keep the all the default
225:21 - styling for my primary navigation all
225:24 - together and then we can have our media
225:26 - queries where we're making changes to
225:28 - the different things that are in here
225:30 - and because we had a media query for a
225:32 - max width i'm going to do a min width of
225:35 - 35m
225:37 - but for this one i'm actually going to
225:38 - do and a max width
225:40 - of 35m as well and these just like a max
225:43 - width i don't actually use very often i
225:45 - don't often use these linked ones like
225:47 - this either but if we come and take a
225:49 - look there's a few important differences
225:50 - here so one of them is the numbers and
225:52 - one of them is the padding is different
225:54 - here and here so since the padding is
225:56 - different and i have to overwrite it
225:57 - anyway and because i do have to deal
225:59 - with this number thing where we have
226:00 - numbers at the smallest size then they
226:02 - disappear then they come back we're
226:04 - going to need a media query like this
226:06 - one anyway and this should be 45 not 35
226:10 - and so i'm gonna let you try this out
226:12 - get it all working and i'll give you my
226:13 - solution in the next lesson
226:18 - all right i hope that went well for you
226:20 - and you're able to solve both of those
226:21 - problems uh so the first thing i'm going
226:23 - to do is choose my primary not my header
226:25 - but my primary navigation itself because
226:27 - this is where the padding is and that
226:29 - background color that we had so if we go
226:31 - and take a look at what we want we need
226:33 - this extra spacing on the left and the
226:35 - right which we currently do not have so
226:38 - if you didn't already do it come in try
226:40 - and add it on right now
226:44 - and with that it was some padding on the
226:45 - left and the right which if we want the
226:47 - shorthand version is padding inline and
226:49 - again this is a logical property it's
226:51 - part of more part of the modern css that
226:53 - we the that i am just in love with and
226:55 - i'm just going to throw a two ram on
226:57 - there and you know we'll make that a 3
226:59 - ram
227:00 - and there we go we can see that it's
227:01 - looking pretty good our logo is
227:03 - currently bumping into there which isn't
227:06 - the prettiest thing in the world but
227:07 - we'll be able to fix that without any uh
227:09 - issues i think especially once we turn
227:11 - these numbers off and so let's go and
227:12 - turn those off now and to be able to do
227:14 - that i'm going to use the same approach
227:16 - that i took when i set all of those up
227:18 - in the first place which is my primary
227:20 - navigation a span so we can actually
227:23 - copy this selector
227:24 - if i'm modifying a selector i want to
227:27 - generally use the same thing unless it's
227:29 - like in that previous lesson where we
227:30 - actually went
227:31 - a bit more complicated where we came in
227:33 - with the like primary navigation dot
227:35 - underline indicators so as being even
227:37 - more specific but it's either just as
227:39 - specific or more specific i'm gonna go
227:41 - just as specific and nice and easy we
227:43 - can just throw a display of none on
227:45 - there and that's it so if we come and
227:46 - take a look now we have the numbers at
227:48 - our small screen sizes those numbers
227:50 - disappear at the tablet size and then
227:52 - those numbers come back in when we get
227:54 - to more of the desktop screen size so i
227:57 - don't think that was too bad at all i
227:58 - think it's looking pretty good and now
228:00 - there's one last change that i want to
228:02 - do is just to deal with the space in
228:04 - between my navigation items because they
228:06 - are very close together especially when
228:08 - we're at this size where we clearly
228:10 - could have a bit more room between them
228:12 - and so this is um i'm going to come all
228:14 - the way up and if you remember we did
228:16 - all of the the spacing on there through
228:19 - my primer on my primary navigation with
228:21 - the gap property and that's because we
228:24 - have the gap set up with the flex which
228:25 - we're using
228:27 - and so on here there's once again
228:29 - different approaches i could come in
228:30 - here and say gap and let's just make it
228:32 - really big so we can actually see that
228:34 - it's working and then we have a much
228:35 - bigger space between them i'm worried
228:37 - that we're going to run out of room just
228:38 - like we are there before we get into the
228:40 - different screen size
228:42 - so once again
228:44 - i think what we could do is come in and
228:45 - use a similar system to what we created
228:48 - when we did this so why don't you come
228:50 - and see a number that you could play
228:52 - with on that gap to set a minimum
228:54 - maximum and get it to respond nicely to
228:56 - the different screen sizes and then i'll
228:58 - come in and look at what type of thing i
229:00 - would set up here
229:04 - and you know what i'm going to start
229:05 - with this
229:06 - as my starting ground and let's go see
229:08 - what it looks like and this is where
229:09 - people always wonder what number to use
229:11 - where this 5vw is
229:13 - and
229:14 - truth be told you just sort of gotta
229:17 - play with it and see and look at that
229:18 - that actually worked out really well we
229:21 - have enough space between them that when
229:23 - we get to the this type of space then
229:25 - it's not smashing into our logo just as
229:27 - we run out of room it goes and stacks
229:30 - underneath instead so i'm actually
229:32 - really happy with that but it is a
229:34 - number
229:35 - that you do have to just sort of come
229:37 - and play with and maybe you want a
229:38 - little bit more spacing so you come and
229:40 - make that number a little bit bigger but
229:42 - you see now we're running into that
229:43 - clash so this i think at 5 works but you
229:46 - could also play with this maximum and
229:48 - this minimum number and see what works
229:50 - for you to make sure that the minimum
229:52 - maybe you make this growth factor maybe
229:55 - you play with the growth factor and you
229:56 - play with the minimum to make sure that
229:58 - they're not getting too close
230:00 - so this is where you could really play
230:01 - with this one as well as play with these
230:03 - two numbers here to see what it looks
230:05 - like at different screen sizes and play
230:07 - with it a little bit and yes you're
230:08 - making some design decisions when you're
230:10 - doing this so if this were you working
230:12 - on a team and you might have designers
230:14 - this could be a conversation that you
230:15 - have with them and that would also give
230:17 - the designers an idea of the types of
230:19 - things you can do as a developer and
230:21 - that helps in the long run when they are
230:23 - designing things they can think oh he
230:25 - has the ability to do this so i can
230:27 - design these things to take that into
230:29 - account this is where it can be really
230:31 - nice to have discussions but when you're
230:32 - doing projects like front end mentor i
230:34 - think it's a really nice way to have a
230:35 - really nice looking design that you
230:37 - already have so it's going to look good
230:38 - no matter what and then you can come and
230:40 - play with these little things to make
230:41 - these little tweaks and to make things
230:43 - work at the different screen sizes when
230:45 - you find like you're running into little
230:46 - problems along the way so if you want
230:48 - now you could take this and see if you
230:50 - can get it working at the larger screen
230:52 - size adding the space will go on top
230:53 - here and this line that is right here
230:55 - and if you get stuck or frustrated with
230:57 - any of them i'll be coming giving you a
230:58 - helping hand in the next lesson
231:04 - so we have this done and now we need to
231:05 - move on to these larger sizes right here
231:08 - so let's just go ahead and take a look
231:09 - at
231:10 - sort of where we want and we can see
231:11 - there that when our padding disappears
231:13 - that's where we need to make the changes
231:16 - and i'm going to start with the easy
231:17 - wins and then come in with the line
231:19 - afterwards because i had a lot of
231:21 - trouble with that line so if you did too
231:23 - and you got caught up along the way or
231:25 - had any struggles at all hopefully i can
231:26 - help you out and push you in the right
231:28 - direction uh for how we can solve this
231:31 - so the very first thing i'm going to do
231:32 - is come down
231:33 - to where we have my media query here
231:36 - we're going to create a new media query
231:38 - which is going to add media and we're
231:40 - going to say a min width of 45 m and we
231:43 - are actually going to see a an issue
231:45 - with our media queries here and here and
231:47 - we'll solve that as we go through
231:50 - but the first thing we do is a primary
231:51 - navigation
231:53 - and what will this do is add some margin
231:55 - to the top and the bottom and just like
231:58 - we can use padding inline for the left
232:00 - and the right we've been looking a lot
232:01 - at logical properties so we can come in
232:03 - and use one of those for the margin if
232:05 - you didn't do that you'd like to give it
232:07 - a try go for that right now
232:10 - and therefore that would be a margin
232:12 - block so my margin block i'm gonna go in
232:13 - with a two ram and let's go take a look
232:16 - there we go we can see we've added that
232:17 - so here
232:18 - it should disappear and then there it
232:20 - comes in so we have that little snap
232:22 - point there so it matches more closely
232:24 - with the design just like we can see
232:26 - here and all right so the next step
232:28 - we're going to do is add that padding
232:30 - that we need so once again we'll stick
232:32 - with right here and we can change our
232:34 - padding inline and you might be going
232:36 - well kevin do we really need to change
232:38 - the padding lines let's just say we come
232:39 - in here and save padding inline is going
232:41 - to go to a7 rem and let's go and take a
232:43 - look at what that looks like so here we
232:44 - have lots of padding and when we go to
232:46 - the smaller size
232:47 - right
232:49 - there it clicks over and makes that
232:51 - change and maybe that's actually a
232:52 - little bit big
232:53 - for what we have now because we're
232:54 - getting we're getting actually a little
232:56 - bit of overflow with that and so this is
232:58 - somewhere where maybe instead of taking
233:00 - this approach of changing the padding
233:02 - because you can clearly see the padding
233:03 - is bigger here and smaller over here
233:06 - we could actually remove this from here
233:09 - completely so i'm going to remove that
233:10 - from that media query
233:13 - and we can take this one off here as
233:15 - well and what we could do is actually
233:17 - have a media
233:19 - min width of 35 m but without a max
233:23 - width on it
233:24 - where we have our
233:25 - we throw this in there and we can
233:27 - actually change this and use either a
233:29 - min a max or what i will be doing in
233:31 - this situation is a clamp so why don't
233:33 - you come in and try that if this isn't
233:35 - the solution that you used when you did
233:36 - this on your own before to see how you
233:39 - can get it working choose the growth
233:40 - factor and all of that play around with
233:42 - a little bit and then i'll look at my
233:44 - solution after
233:47 - all right so i hope that went well for
233:48 - you so here i am going to come in with
233:50 - my clamp and we're going to give it the
233:52 - minimum which i'll do three i'm going to
233:54 - have to give it a middle value and we
233:55 - will have to come in with a
233:57 - maximum which could be around six or
233:59 - seven and then this is the growth factor
234:02 - and this just becomes a number that you
234:03 - have to play with and experiment a
234:04 - little bit with your design and see how
234:06 - things work so you can see that it's
234:08 - shrinking down here you can see you can
234:10 - see that padding getting bigger and
234:11 - smaller as i adjust here and then it
234:13 - maxes out at a maximum size and then the
234:15 - shrinking shrinking shrinking and then
234:18 - at one point we'll cross over and we go
234:20 - to the smaller size here
234:22 - so there we go i think that's actually
234:24 - looking pretty good and it's working
234:25 - well but we could always change this
234:27 - growth factor depending on how you want
234:30 - things to work so let's try 5 vw instead
234:33 - and that just means it's going to grow
234:34 - and shrink much slower so one advantage
234:37 - with that smaller number is our logo
234:38 - doesn't actually collide into there with
234:40 - the break points i used of course
234:41 - another solution would be to have
234:43 - different break points which would be a
234:44 - very valid solution as well and if ever
234:46 - you did want to change them you could
234:48 - just do a find and go through and change
234:50 - some of the breakpoints you have if
234:51 - you're wondering why we don't have
234:53 - custom properties as our breakpoints uh
234:56 - that is one thing we can't do is set
234:57 - custom properties here because that
234:58 - would make life very easy to make
235:00 - changes but that is something that they
235:02 - are looking to add to the css spec
235:05 - so with that in place i think it's
235:06 - looking pretty good i'm pretty happy
235:08 - with that it doesn't quite get as big as
235:10 - maybe i would like it at the larger
235:11 - screen sizes so again this could be a
235:13 - number that you play with and and have
235:15 - some fun with so maybe i bring it up to
235:17 - a seven and again it's a little bit of a
235:18 - fiddly number i won't lie to you
235:22 - and that actually looks pretty good and
235:23 - i'm pretty happy with where that's
235:25 - breaking and the last thing we need to
235:26 - do is add the line here and as i said
235:29 - the line is a little bit difficult and
235:30 - it took me a long time to come up with a
235:32 - solution that i was happy with and in
235:34 - the end my solution i think is a
235:36 - relatively simple one but it's not
235:38 - something i would normally try and
235:39 - implement and so if you found another
235:42 - solution please let me know either in
235:43 - the scrimba discord over on twitter just
235:46 - ping me and let me know what solution
235:48 - you might have come up with along the
235:49 - way and what i'm going to do is set the
235:50 - stage for you in how i'm going to solve
235:53 - this and then see if you can finish it
235:55 - and in the next video i'll give you my
235:57 - full solution
235:58 - and so to set the stage i will work
236:00 - within this media query and again we
236:02 - will have to probably make a small
236:03 - change with these but we'll talk about
236:05 - that in the next video as well
236:07 - and what i'm going to do is go on my
236:10 - primary header and we should probably
236:12 - move this primary header over to the top
236:15 - over here
236:17 - and on my primary header i don't need to
236:19 - necessarily select it but i do want to
236:22 - come in and select the a pseudo element
236:24 - and you could use it before or after it
236:25 - won't actually make a difference here
236:27 - i'll choose the before but again either
236:29 - one um it wouldn't change anything so
236:31 - for that we do need to give it some
236:33 - content for it to actually populate on
236:35 - the page and i'm going to give it a
236:37 - display of block
236:38 - and a position of relative because i
236:40 - normally i would come in with a position
236:42 - of absolute in which case you don't have
236:43 - to give it a display property
236:45 - and absolute which would mean that if i
236:48 - did that i would also need my primary
236:50 - header to have a position of relative
236:54 - and let's
236:56 - we'll do a quick thing here and show why
236:57 - this didn't work for me
236:59 - and so i had a height of one pixel here
237:01 - and a background of red
237:04 - width of 50 just for fun and see what
237:07 - that gives us and we should see there's
237:09 - a red line coming on
237:11 - and the issue with using an absolute
237:13 - positioned element is this number here
237:15 - and getting the right width and we're
237:17 - using left and right and all of that but
237:18 - we can come in and we can play with that
237:20 - number and actually it's probably gonna
237:21 - have to be let's try 10 and see what
237:23 - that gives us
237:24 - and now i'm going to give it a left and
237:26 - i'm going to give it a left value that
237:28 - sort of follows with my navi uh with
237:31 - where the logo is so my left of six rim
237:34 - and let's go and see what that actually
237:35 - looks like
237:36 - so there we go we can see and actually i
237:38 - guess that should have been eight and
237:39 - now that i think about it so we can give
237:41 - it the left of eight and it's getting in
237:42 - the right spot there but then how wide
237:44 - do i make it and the other issue is uh
237:46 - the size of this if we do this as a
237:48 - percentage so 10's too small so you come
237:51 - up to 20 and now 20 is sort of the right
237:53 - size but now it's too small and then
237:55 - actually now let's give it a z-index as
237:57 - well
237:58 - just so it goes on top and okay so now
238:01 - you can see how like it's ten percent
238:03 - it's way too big it's not working
238:05 - um and this i tried doing this also as a
238:08 - position
238:09 - as a pseudo element based on my
238:11 - navigation itself but again to get it to
238:13 - actually adapt to the space that we have
238:15 - available to sort of always fill in the
238:17 - space became something that was very
238:19 - hard to do and the percentages were
238:21 - always based on the wrong thing and i
238:23 - tried viewport units and i tried all
238:24 - sorts of stuff and so if you went down
238:26 - that route and you got stuck don't feel
238:28 - bad that's the same thing i did um so
238:31 - what i'm actually going to do is we can
238:32 - delete this because we won't need it and
238:34 - as i said i'm going to change this to a
238:36 - position of a relative instead
238:38 - and this does change a whole bunch of
238:40 - things we don't need our z index anymore
238:42 - and i am going to take off the width and
238:45 - because we're going to see you don't
238:46 - actually need it and i'm going to take
238:47 - off the left as well and let's go and
238:49 - just take a look and we should see
238:51 - uh or you know what let's give it a
238:53 - width of 100
238:54 - because we do need something on there
238:55 - and now you can actually see there is a
238:57 - line there it's not causing overflow
238:58 - it's growing it's shrinking
239:00 - and because it is position relative it's
239:03 - actually in my dom right now it's
239:04 - actually interacting with my logo and
239:07 - with my header which is why the logo has
239:09 - moved over because i've done this as a
239:11 - before if i do it as an after it would
239:12 - switch over and go after my navigation
239:15 - now you can see that it's over here and
239:17 - this is where things get interesting
239:18 - because our line is a either before or
239:21 - after that is positioned within we have
239:24 - a logo we have this and this is another
239:26 - flex item in my header now with how this
239:28 - is working which we can then use to get
239:31 - it to go where we need it to go and play
239:32 - around with it a little bit so i'm going
239:35 - to leave this right here and challenge
239:36 - you to see if you can get it in the
239:38 - right place and then of course get the
239:39 - right color and all of that and then in
239:41 - the next lesson i'll give you my own
239:42 - solution
239:46 - so i hope you were able to figure that
239:47 - out but if not no big deal let's go get
239:49 - that red line where we want it to be and
239:52 - to do that first i'm going to go over to
239:53 - my index and take a look because we have
239:56 - to remember we have my header
239:58 - which has this display flex on there so
240:00 - this is one flex child this nav is
240:03 - another one because our button is a
240:04 - display none and then we have it now set
240:06 - as an after it could be a before
240:08 - and because it's on the header after
240:11 - it's getting positioned right here so
240:13 - this is my
240:15 - after is here
240:17 - if you did it as a before instead the
240:20 - before would come all the way up and be
240:22 - right here and that would be my before
240:25 - is here and that's because of how
240:27 - pseudo-elements work whereas if i do a
240:28 - before on my primary header it was
240:30 - before the content that is here and if i
240:32 - do an after then it goes after it i'm
240:34 - going to leave mine as an after so we're
240:35 - just going to remember that my after is
240:36 - here and we have this div here then i
240:39 - have my nav and then i have my after
240:41 - and to get this to work now what i'm
240:43 - going to do is come over to here and on
240:45 - my after i'm going to add something
240:48 - which is going to be an order property
240:50 - so order is going to be a number one
240:54 - and if we go and take a look that
240:55 - shouldn't have actually changed anything
240:57 - it's right where we left it off but
240:58 - let's just say i came in and made this a
241:00 - negative one what would actually happen
241:02 - is it goes before everything else and
241:04 - order is a property that opens up when
241:06 - we're using css i would normally not
241:08 - recommend that you use order for many
241:10 - things but in this case because we're
241:12 - moving a decorative element around i
241:13 - think it's perfectly fine to be using
241:15 - order for something like this and again
241:17 - i'm going to put this as a number one
241:19 - just to keep track and make things a
241:20 - little bit easier for me and let's just
241:22 - go back to the html for a second because
241:23 - we want this to go before my nav we're
241:26 - going to do is select that nav and we
241:28 - can say that that has an order
241:30 - of two on it and now if we go and take a
241:33 - look like magic it's gone in between the
241:36 - two of them and because it is a flex
241:37 - item it will grow and shrink and there's
241:39 - no content that's actually in there
241:41 - there's only a width so we'll actually
241:42 - shrink down to zero if we do run out of
241:44 - room which is kind of cool the only
241:46 - issue is i do want it to go on top over
241:49 - here and right now we have these spaces
241:51 - that's a good question and if you were
241:53 - stuck before i'm getting it to be in the
241:55 - right spot and now you know how to do it
241:57 - but you want to do the final touches i'm
241:58 - going to leave this here for you to try
242:00 - out and then afterward i'll give you my
242:02 - solution on finishing this up
242:07 - all right so this is another one that i
242:08 - wouldn't normally
242:10 - use but what we're going to do is i'm
242:12 - going to come and give this a margin on
242:14 - the right side of negative let's try
242:16 - three rem and see where that positions
242:18 - it and go take a look and look at that
242:20 - it's pulling right on top there and it's
242:22 - going to grow and shrink now we do run
242:24 - into this strange little area here where
242:26 - right like where there's some weird
242:28 - stuff happening here we'll address that
242:30 - in a second but for the most part i find
242:32 - it's actually working really well i
242:33 - might drop this down to a 2.5 um instead
242:36 - just so i think it's i think it looks a
242:38 - little bit better there and i'm pretty
242:40 - happy with that let's lastly just come
242:42 - on and change this to our
242:44 - uh
242:45 - light white color like it is in the
242:47 - design instead of that bright red and
242:49 - there we go i think that's looking
242:51 - pretty good and i'm happy with that and
242:53 - that last thing that we want to address
242:55 - or that i mentioned where things get a
242:56 - little bit funky is right here you'll
242:58 - notice that we get this weird like
243:00 - middle ground that's happening where
243:02 - we're jumping all over the place for a
243:03 - little bit
243:04 - and that's just because of how the min
243:06 - widths and max widths work where there's
243:08 - this strange middle ground between our
243:11 - max width here and our min width right
243:13 - here and so what i'm actually going to
243:14 - do is change this one over to a 44.999
243:17 - and it seems silly but it does help us
243:19 - solve this issue and in the future there
243:21 - is a new syntax coming to css which is
243:24 - uses like greater than and less than
243:26 - which is going to make our life so much
243:27 - better
243:28 - and easier to prevent these types of
243:29 - things from happening but for the time
243:31 - being we do have to work with that so
243:33 - now if i look at it when we hit that
243:34 - break point right here and that that
243:36 - just prevents that weird overlap where
243:38 - the numbers were disappearing before we
243:39 - switched to the other layout and so this
243:42 - just helps prevent that from happening
243:44 - the other thing that you need to look at
243:46 - when you're doing something like this
243:47 - also just to be aware of 99 of users
243:50 - don't actually actively resize the
243:52 - browser once they're open and they're on
243:54 - a site so us as devs we like to move
243:56 - things and play with things and see how
243:58 - things respond once a user is on a page
244:00 - like they're here that's what they're
244:01 - looking at it like or if it's here
244:03 - that's what they're looking at it like
244:04 - or if it's here that's what it looks
244:05 - like on their device especially mobile
244:07 - devices where you're not really resizing
244:09 - pages unless you change the orientation
244:11 - of your device so yeah with that i think
244:13 - i'm happy with that solution if you want
244:15 - to play around with it experiment with
244:16 - it a little bit or if you want to try
244:18 - and do alternate approaches to it that
244:20 - would be really really awesome and then
244:21 - once you're ready we'll move on to the
244:23 - next page
244:27 - so i know we said we'd be getting into
244:28 - the next pages but before we get there i
244:30 - want to make a few accessibility tweaks
244:32 - to this page and so the next two lessons
244:35 - are gonna be focused on that the first
244:36 - one is tweaking what we currently have
244:38 - now and the second one is going to be
244:39 - making a small addition to what we're
244:42 - working on that is a very important one
244:44 - for accessibility reasons which i'll
244:46 - explain once we get to that one but the
244:48 - two ones we're doing in this are really
244:50 - easy and simple ones so we're going to
244:52 - start with that these are the easy wins
244:54 - that you can make when you're working on
244:55 - a page and they're very common things
244:57 - that i see
244:58 - not done and one of those is right here
245:01 - with this which is
245:03 - the you know this is this content that's
245:05 - all there so we have this section at the
245:07 - top with our header which is great we
245:09 - have a nav so we're using our nice
245:10 - semantic html there but over here we're
245:13 - not doing it so much and there's one
245:15 - important change and again this is
245:16 - something that i see lots of sites not
245:18 - bothering with and so i wanted to make
245:19 - sure we had a specific lesson that would
245:21 - take a look at it because it is such a
245:23 - easy thing that you can change and a
245:25 - really big accessibility win so if you
245:27 - know what it is already go ahead and
245:29 - make that change and if you're not too
245:31 - sure you can wait just a second and i'll
245:32 - take a look at it
245:35 - and that one change is there's two ways
245:37 - we could do this we could come here and
245:39 - just take a main and wrap all of this
245:41 - within our main because this is main
245:43 - content and it's really important to
245:44 - have a main on your page and you should
245:46 - have only one main per page uh of course
245:49 - by doing this there is a small problem
245:51 - that has happened is our
245:53 - grid container home which was helping to
245:55 - set things up a little bit for us with
245:57 - aligning uh different things is now not
245:59 - working so everything is stuck to the
246:00 - top instead of being at the bottom where
246:02 - we'd taken all that hard work to do it
246:04 - so there's absolutely nothing wrong with
246:06 - taking what we have here and switching
246:08 - this over to our main and just making
246:10 - this our close main and you can
246:12 - definitely have classes and other things
246:15 - that are applied to here we will be
246:16 - adding something to it in the next
246:18 - lesson as well and the main axe is a
246:21 - landmark for assistive technologies uh
246:23 - just like our nav does as well and these
246:26 - can be used to quickly get to different
246:29 - areas within a site and for the screen
246:30 - reader to know that here is actually the
246:32 - navigation and here is our main content
246:35 - and if you have a footer which this
246:36 - design doesn't have any use for footers
246:39 - but we have our footers and our sides
246:40 - and articles and all of those different
246:42 - things and many of them are acting as
246:44 - landmarks to help navigate through a
246:46 - site and there is another thing we can
246:48 - do to really help out people who are
246:49 - using screen readers and let's go take a
246:50 - look at our page to understand how this
246:52 - is going to work let's just hit a
246:53 - refresh there we go so we can see it's
246:55 - working and that other thing is when you
246:57 - look here and you're looking at these
246:59 - you're not reading zero zero home zero
247:01 - one destination zero two crew zero three
247:04 - technology you're coming up and reading
247:06 - home destination crew technology and
247:09 - because we have bold text here and then
247:11 - the lighter text here visually there's a
247:13 - distinction between the decorative piece
247:15 - of information and the text itself
247:17 - because visually we can see that
247:19 - distinction between those two pieces of
247:20 - information we just zone out and we
247:22 - focus on the the important piece there
247:24 - the home the destination the crew the
247:26 - technology parts
247:28 - and the other part just acts as a nice
247:29 - little decoration on top of that
247:32 - but if you're on a screen reader who's
247:33 - reading this content it doesn't know it
247:35 - just reads zero zero home zero one
247:37 - destination zero two crew zero three
247:40 - technology and as you can imagine that
247:42 - could be very very frustrating so what
247:44 - we're going to do is i'm going to come
247:46 - on all of these spans and if you know
247:47 - what i'm going to do you can pause and
247:50 - go ahead and add it on now but if you're
247:52 - not too sure then just wait one second
247:53 - and i'll give my solution
247:57 - all right so what i'm going to do is add
247:58 - another area and in this case i'm using
248:00 - area hidden is equal to true
248:03 - and a little bit like how when we set up
248:06 - our
248:07 - button we used the sr only class on this
248:10 - and that s our only class was so a
248:13 - screen reader would still see this but a
248:15 - sighted user would not see it so
248:17 - visually hiding this but screen readers
248:19 - can still access it
248:21 - area hidden is a little bit of the
248:22 - opposite it is hiding it from screen
248:25 - readers but it is allowing it to still
248:27 - visually be on the page so we can use
248:29 - this to hide decorative elements or
248:31 - sometimes there's effects where you need
248:32 - to have double content so you have the
248:34 - same text two times in a row if you're
248:36 - on a screen reader that would drive
248:37 - somebody absolutely nuts you're steering
248:39 - the same words over and over again so
248:41 - using area hidden true allows us to keep
248:43 - the content on the page but to hide it
248:45 - from screen readers because really it is
248:47 - just decorative extra information so two
248:49 - very easy wins that we can get right
248:51 - here without very much work and in the
248:53 - next lesson we'll be looking at one more
248:58 - so in the last lesson we added our area
249:00 - hidden true and we also added the main
249:01 - an image and the main can act as a
249:03 - landmark and it's a very important
249:04 - element to have on a page always have a
249:07 - main and every page should only have one
249:09 - main and it just you know it's we're
249:11 - saying this is the main content of our
249:13 - page and while so far a lot of the
249:15 - accessibility things that i've been
249:16 - talking about are dealing with screen
249:17 - readers there's other types of
249:19 - disabilities as well and there's
249:21 - different ways that people navigate
249:22 - websites and imagine if you're a sighted
249:25 - user and you come on our page and you
249:27 - want to get to the explore button but
249:28 - you don't have the ability to use a
249:30 - mouse and you're just using keyboard
249:32 - navigation so what does that mean well
249:33 - you get to the page and you tab tab tab
249:35 - tab tab and then you can hit your
249:37 - explore button and then from there once
249:39 - again you have to tab through and
249:40 - eventually get to the content and then
249:41 - you're on the crew page you get the idea
249:44 - always having to cycle through the
249:45 - navigation to get to the main content
249:47 - can be very just extra time that we're
249:49 - wasting that somebody who's using a
249:51 - mouse doesn't have to do because you can
249:52 - just drag your mouse down to here and
249:54 - click and so it's super easy to make an
249:56 - accommodation for this it's incredibly
249:58 - easy so that's we're going to be
249:59 - focusing on in this lesson
250:02 - and i'm going to start by coming on to
250:04 - the main here and we're going to make
250:06 - one little difference we're going to add
250:07 - an id is equal to main and we want to do
250:10 - that because we want to make it easy to
250:12 - link to this content then we come all
250:14 - the way to the top up here and we can
250:15 - say a
250:17 - is equal to our main
250:19 - and by doing that and i'm going to put
250:21 - skip
250:22 - to main content
250:24 - and close a or you could even just have
250:26 - skip to content and then we are able to
250:29 - skip to the content in our page and just
250:32 - to see how that would work let's go and
250:34 - take a look i'm going to do an inline
250:36 - style that we'll take off here
250:37 - so style is going to be color
250:40 - white just to make it really easy to
250:42 - read for now
250:43 - and i'm doing it the old-fashioned way
250:46 - so color is white and if we go take a
250:48 - look there is my skippy content so if
250:50 - somebody lands on my page now if
250:52 - somebody lands on the page now and i hit
250:54 - tab the first thing that actually gets
250:56 - selected is that skip to content uh
250:59 - right there and so if you then click it
251:01 - with enter on the keyboard and then hit
251:03 - tab you can see i've already selected my
251:05 - explore button so i was able to skip
251:08 - going over all of these different things
251:10 - if you are on a bigger site that had a
251:12 - larger navigation or a big heading and
251:14 - you want to be able to skip to you would
251:15 - scroll down to that section and skip all
251:17 - of that extra stuff and bring you to the
251:19 - main content
251:20 - now obviously it's a little bit
251:22 - obtrusive having it like this you might
251:24 - be feeling like you should throw an sr
251:26 - only class on there but again this is
251:28 - not only for screen readers where they
251:29 - would have the ability to skip all of
251:31 - that and hit the main content which
251:32 - would be nice because this would be the
251:34 - first thing that is read to them but
251:36 - there are cited users who are going to
251:38 - use this as well so we're actually going
251:40 - to come on here and let's give this a
251:42 - class
251:43 - is equal to and i'm going to call it uh
251:46 - skip to
251:48 - content it's very descriptive of what
251:50 - it's doing we take our style off of here
251:52 - now and we're going to do a few things
251:54 - to style it up because we don't want a
251:55 - purple link sitting at the top of our
251:57 - page
251:58 - and one approach for this if you want to
252:00 - try it out i'll give you a second to do
252:02 - it but one approach is actually to
252:04 - use the sr only class but to not have it
252:07 - working when but when something comes in
252:10 - focus for this to go off if that makes
252:13 - sense so if you want to try that what
252:15 - i'll actually do is come on here and add
252:17 - the sr only and this is approach i've
252:19 - seen and i've used
252:21 - so it's visually hidden but when we gain
252:24 - focus you want that link to then become
252:26 - visible so i'll come right here and let
252:28 - you try that out to see if you can get
252:29 - it working and then in just a second
252:31 - i'll give you my solution
252:35 - all right so the solution uh there let's
252:37 - just come in and say skip to
252:40 - uh content not to main skip the content
252:42 - and i want when it is in focus so once
252:46 - it's come in focus we can say that it
252:48 - has a position of relative
252:50 - a width of 100 i'll actually do a max
252:53 - content on this if you don't know it
252:54 - we'll explain what that is in a little
252:56 - bit
252:57 - the height of auto and i'm sort of just
252:58 - coming through and overwriting some of
253:00 - these clip of zero
253:02 - and i'll also come in here and give this
253:04 - a background that is white
253:06 - and a color that is black just so we can
253:09 - visually see what's happening
253:11 - and with that in place let's go and see
253:13 - what happens and there it is skip the
253:14 - content is now visible so i can push
253:16 - enter and the next time i hit tab i am
253:18 - selecting this over here and i've
253:20 - skipped my navigation i've gone down to
253:22 - the main content
253:24 - and let's just we can reverse and shift
253:26 - tab goes backwards so i can shift tab
253:28 - bring it back in tab again and then go
253:30 - through my navigation if that's what i
253:31 - want to do and while that works i for me
253:34 - i'm i've sort of moved away from that
253:36 - now and i sort of style this up on its
253:38 - own because then we can do a little bit
253:39 - more with it and we're not fighting
253:41 - against this sr only class so much to
253:44 - for when things come into focus
253:46 - so what we can do instead let's delete
253:49 - all that and we're also going to take
253:50 - the focus off of here and i'm going to
253:52 - make it look a little bit better and
253:53 - then i have a small challenge for you so
253:55 - i'm gonna give it a background and come
253:56 - in with my actual color and then use my
253:59 - color dark uh we'll give it a little bit
254:01 - of padding so padding of 0.5 m and 1m
254:05 - and let's give it also a margin in line
254:09 - of uh i was in right center of auto to
254:12 - place it in the center and i'm just
254:14 - going to save over here to make sure
254:16 - that everything is done and there we go
254:18 - it's perfect and so we have this nice
254:20 - skip to content so if i tab onto that
254:22 - and then push enter and then tab
254:25 - it's still working everything is good
254:27 - and it looks a little bit nicer
254:29 - what i want to do though instead of
254:31 - having it um
254:33 - we don't want it obviously always
254:34 - visually there so another step that we
254:38 - will take
254:38 - is to come and give this a position of
254:41 - absolute absolute
254:43 - and that should actually leave it
254:45 - exactly the same everything will be the
254:47 - same as what was before the big
254:49 - difference is it's pulled it out of the
254:50 - flow so the other content isn't paying
254:52 - attention to it so it doesn't increase
254:54 - the size of the space that we have there
254:55 - normally and of course then we'll also
254:58 - come on here and give this a z index and
255:01 - we'll give it our nice big z index to
255:03 - make sure that it's on top of everything
255:05 - i don't think we'll run into problems
255:06 - with it but just to make sure we didn't
255:08 - we have a one thousand and two thousand
255:10 - this is like our ultimate winner every
255:12 - single time and there we can see that
255:14 - it's visually on top
255:16 - now there's one last step and this is
255:17 - where the challenge comes in is we want
255:19 - it to be visually hidden off the screen
255:21 - somehow and when someone focuses on it
255:23 - it can come into the screen and it could
255:25 - be nice if it was done with a nice
255:26 - little animation of some sorts or
255:28 - transition so i'll leave you to your own
255:30 - devices to see if you can come up with a
255:32 - solution to that and then in a few
255:33 - seconds i'll show you how i would do it
255:37 - all right so what i'm going to do is
255:38 - come on here and say transform and we'll
255:40 - do a translate of y which is the up and
255:42 - down axis and on the translate we can
255:45 - say a hundred percent and 100 we'll move
255:48 - it 100 of its own height now 100 we'll
255:51 - move it down so if we go look we can see
255:53 - it's moved down which we don't want to
255:55 - do we want to do negative 100
255:58 - and just like that it's visually hidden
256:00 - from the screen because it's it's in no
256:02 - man's land somewhere we can't access
256:04 - because it's too high up
256:06 - so to fix that
256:08 - to content
256:09 - focus and on that one we can then change
256:11 - the transform of translate y
256:15 - and put it back down to zero so now if
256:18 - i'm on the page i hit tab it comes into
256:20 - focus and then when i keep going it goes
256:22 - away and then we can gain focus back in
256:24 - and as i said it'd be nice if there was
256:26 - a nice little animation or something for
256:27 - it to come in and visually make sure
256:29 - that it gets people's attention as it's
256:31 - coming in so if you haven't so if you
256:33 - didn't figure this out or if you tried a
256:35 - different solution and now you want to
256:36 - add the little animation in there
256:38 - yourself you can go ahead and do it and
256:40 - i'll add it in in just a second
256:43 - and for me that would just be a nice
256:44 - little transition of my transform we'll
256:47 - do 250 milliseconds ease in
256:50 - and so by doing that let's go save that
256:53 - take a look at what happens and now it
256:56 - will fade in and then slide back out so
256:58 - i think that's nice it's a using the
257:01 - animation in this way is also a nice way
257:03 - to make sure that people see um when it
257:05 - comes in because the animation of it
257:07 - will catch the eye and then if they want
257:09 - to use it they can use it and if not it
257:10 - disappears and they can keep going
257:12 - through the rest of the site and with
257:14 - that we now have all of this done and
257:16 - our accessibility is more up to scratch
257:18 - and if you've never seen the skipped
257:20 - content before i'd encourage you to go
257:22 - on to other sites and try it out and see
257:23 - if you can find it on other sites
257:25 - because it is all over the place and
257:27 - many people don't even know that it's
257:29 - there and you can get ideas on how
257:31 - people style them on the different ways
257:32 - they bring them in or hide them and go
257:34 - into your dev tools explore and see how
257:36 - they're hiding it and how they're
257:37 - showing it because there's always
257:38 - different approaches to it and so yeah
257:40 - that is it for this one maybe it would
257:42 - be a great time to take a break and then
257:43 - i will see you in the destination page
257:45 - when you are ready
257:50 - all right so we're moving on to the
257:52 - destination page and this is really
257:54 - where things are going to get a bit more
257:55 - interesting and you get to make those
257:56 - decisions that i talked about because we
257:58 - have multiple pages that all have to be
258:00 - built out and they could be done all as
258:02 - separate pages or they could all be done
258:04 - as a single page where we're bringing in
258:06 - the content in many different ways
258:08 - depending on how you would like to
258:10 - approach this as i mentioned earlier i'm
258:13 - going to be doing things where i'm doing
258:14 - it as a single page and will be using
258:17 - javascript to change the content that's
258:19 - visually seen on the screen and for me
258:22 - all of that content will actually be in
258:23 - the html here and we'll be using like a
258:26 - tab type of system but if you would like
258:28 - to take a different approach you can
258:29 - definitely do that where you keep each
258:31 - one of these as their own page and we
258:33 - just link between the different ones or
258:35 - of course there is this data.json that
258:37 - is available to you if you would rather
258:40 - go in that direction as i mentioned for
258:42 - me i'm having a single html page all of
258:44 - the content will be on that page and
258:46 - we're going to be using javascript to
258:48 - show and hide the content that we need
258:50 - to and that is the approach that i'm
258:52 - going to be taking the other thing i
258:54 - will be doing is we will be starting
258:55 - mobile first and working our way up and
258:57 - we've already started setting things up
258:59 - with grid and i will continue using grid
259:01 - because for what i see here i think it's
259:02 - going to work really really well for now
259:05 - going to be tackling this moon page and
259:08 - turning this into what we see here and
259:11 - i'll be focusing on that then i'm going
259:13 - to focus on the crew page i want to get
259:14 - all the layout things done and then
259:17 - after once everything is in place we're
259:19 - happy with everything we're going to
259:20 - circle back around and actually add the
259:22 - functionality to these two pages so if
259:24 - you want to take that same approach that
259:26 - i'll be taking you can do that or of
259:27 - course you just build everything out as
259:29 - much as you can here see if you can add
259:30 - the functionality and everything and
259:32 - eventually see how i do it when you get
259:34 - up to those next stages or if you'd
259:36 - rather just see how i get started with
259:38 - it and then take off from there and do
259:40 - some of the challenges that i'm giving
259:41 - you that's perfectly fine as well but do
259:44 - try and do as much coding on this as
259:45 - possible and not just sitting back and
259:47 - enjoying the ride because you're going
259:49 - to learn a lot more if you're actually
259:50 - implementing the different things on
259:52 - your own good luck with whatever
259:53 - approach you want and when you are ready
259:55 - i'll see you in the next lesson where
259:57 - we're going to be diving in and setting
259:58 - up our destination page
260:03 - all right so let's get started on this
260:05 - i'm excited for this and what i'm going
260:06 - to first do is grab from my header all
260:09 - the way up to my doctype so we have
260:11 - everything there just so we don't forget
260:13 - to bring and all of this our navigation
260:15 - is done our skip link is done we have
260:16 - all our google fonts and all of that so
260:18 - i'm going to bring that all over to this
260:20 - destination and moon and that was all of
260:23 - my head all the way up and i'm going to
260:25 - paste that in like that
260:27 - then the next thing we definitely need
260:28 - to do is change the body class to
260:30 - destination
260:32 - and we then can come down and after the
260:34 - header we want to come in and add our
260:37 - content here for this there is a few
260:39 - things i'm just going to go back over to
260:41 - the index just so we can get a refresher
260:42 - on what we did here where i have my main
260:45 - that has my grid container class on it
260:47 - and so i basically want that and nothing
260:50 - else that is in here and we can jump on
260:53 - over back to my destination moon paste
260:56 - that and just make sure that we close
260:58 - the main right there
261:00 - so we don't need this anymore but we can
261:02 - go and grab all of this
261:05 - cut it out and bring it up into the main
261:07 - and start working from here and one last
261:10 - thing we'll do is my main has the id of
261:12 - main which is good grid container and we
261:13 - have grid container home i'm going to do
261:15 - a grid container destination and because
261:18 - the links aren't actually going to the
261:19 - right spot right now for now i'm just
261:21 - going to click run here in scrimba so we
261:23 - can see our page and we can see that the
261:25 - content is starting to come in though
261:27 - everything is in the wrong spot right
261:29 - now but don't worry we'll be fixing that
261:31 - up pretty quickly
261:32 - for now what i will actually do i'm
261:34 - going to add an x here on my grid
261:36 - container uh we'll do
261:39 - like a bunch so we remind ourselves to
261:41 - turn it off just so we can start styling
261:43 - our content with all the utility classes
261:45 - we have see that it's all looking good
261:47 - without the grid getting in the way and
261:48 - then we can just delete this and then
261:50 - start placing things actually on our
261:52 - grid so if you didn't already build out
261:55 - the page on your own and you're waiting
261:56 - for some of my little challenges well
261:58 - now is the time to do that start adding
262:00 - all the utility classes and the
262:02 - different things that we've already
262:03 - created to style this up the way we need
262:06 - it to i have this here if you want to
262:09 - look at this example but i would really
262:11 - encourage you to either look at the
262:12 - figma or sketch files that are provided
262:14 - by front-end mentor there is a lot more
262:16 - information in those and it will be much
262:17 - easier to get everything that you need
262:19 - from them than looking here but it is
262:21 - completely up to you how you want to
262:23 - work so good luck with that and then
262:25 - when you're ready you can hit play and
262:26 - i'll see you with my own solution
262:31 - all right so we'll start right here and
262:32 - this is going to be my h1 and this is
262:34 - one of those reasons why i said i like
262:37 - having things that are agnostic of the
262:39 - heading levels and close h1 because this
262:42 - doesn't look like an h1 but it clearly
262:44 - is the heading of this page pick your
262:46 - destination and we can tab through moon
262:48 - mars europa titan and we have these sort
262:50 - of subheadings for pick your destination
262:52 - this is the title of the page and then
262:54 - we get information and sub you know
262:56 - that's the the next level down is this
262:59 - information here even though moon is
263:01 - visually the most important thing this
263:03 - really is my h1
263:04 - so h1 is like that but we need to style
263:07 - it and make it look how we want it to
263:09 - and if you remember we actually took
263:11 - some time to do that in our design
263:13 - system numbered titles over here and we
263:16 - did all the hard work to already get
263:18 - that to work so we don't have to do very
263:20 - much and while we're here i do know that
263:22 - we're also going to need my tab list in
263:24 - a second so i am going to come and copy
263:27 - that and we'll bring it in
263:28 - when we need it the first thing we can
263:30 - do is come here and say class is equal
263:32 - to numbered title just like that and
263:35 - then we also want to come here and wrap
263:37 - this in a span
263:39 - and we can close our spam here hit save
263:42 - and look at that a lot of the work is
263:44 - already done for us there is one more
263:47 - improvement we can make here something
263:48 - we did not too long ago
263:50 - to help with accessibility reasons so if
263:53 - you can think of what that is just look
263:54 - up if you're not too sure you can add
263:56 - that into your code
263:58 - and that would be adding an area hidden
264:00 - on here area hidden is equal to true
264:03 - because once again this is much more of
264:05 - a decorative element you don't need the
264:07 - zero one right out loud to you we just
264:08 - want it to say pick your destination
264:11 - so there we go we can visually see it
264:13 - but the screen reader will not read the
264:15 - zero one out loud and we can keep on
264:17 - going at this layout right here the next
264:20 - thing we do have is our image and we're
264:22 - going to have another lesson that's
264:24 - going to focus more specifically on the
264:27 - image because we will switch this over
264:28 - to a picture element but i want to
264:30 - devote an entire lesson to that so for
264:32 - now we'll just use an image
264:34 - png we do have a webp that's available
264:37 - to us there as well but again i'll talk
264:38 - more about that when we switch this over
264:40 - to a picture element in an upcoming
264:42 - lesson and for this we do want to give
264:44 - an alt of the moon and this should not
264:46 - be
264:47 - an image of the moon they know it's an
264:50 - image already so the alt here can just
264:52 - be the moon and nice and simple we have
264:55 - an image that will come in so there we
264:57 - go it's a nice and pretty
264:59 - cool image of the moon right there i
265:00 - think it looks really awesome next up i
265:02 - will come in with the tabs and if you
265:04 - remember i already copied those when we
265:06 - were on our other page so we can
265:08 - paste those in
265:10 - and we have moon mars europa and we'll
265:12 - need one more of these guys
265:15 - just like that and so that this is
265:17 - finished we can delete all of that away
265:20 - and there we go these are already
265:22 - working they're looking just like they
265:23 - need to work and we can bring this down
265:25 - i guess to a smaller size since this is
265:27 - where we're focusing so there we go we
265:29 - do need to center things and all of that
265:30 - but all of this is going to come
265:31 - together
265:33 - very quickly so don't worry too much
265:34 - about that we can see that is working
265:37 - the next thing we want to do is this
265:39 - here and for this part because this bit
265:43 - of information about the moon and what's
265:45 - written in here with some of the you
265:46 - know the information on the average
265:48 - distance and the estimated time travel
265:49 - and all of this this is sort of a
265:51 - self-isolated bit of information so what
265:54 - i'm going to actually do is take all of
265:56 - this and wrap it in an article with the
265:58 - r key called that and come down and
266:01 - close
266:02 - article and you can use articles for
266:05 - lots of things and in this case i'm
266:06 - going to be using it for here and it's
266:09 - anything that's sort of like the
266:10 - self-contained bit of information which
266:12 - is exactly what this is
266:14 - you might see sections used as well but
266:16 - i think that article is actually a bit
266:17 - more semantically correct with the type
266:19 - of information that is in here so now
266:21 - it's just a question of wrapping it all
266:22 - in the right elements and adding in the
266:24 - right utility classes so i'll add the
266:27 - elements quickly and then we'll go back
266:28 - through and add the utility classes
266:31 - all right there we go so i've started
266:32 - doing it there is a little bit more
266:33 - structure that will have to come to this
266:35 - uh but it's setting the stage at least
266:37 - in the right direction and you'll notice
266:39 - here i've used h3s so it's like moon is
266:41 - my category some information on the moon
266:43 - then we have the subcategory of average
266:45 - distance and then we say what the
266:47 - distance is and then estimated time and
266:49 - then the estimated time that goes along
266:51 - with that so
266:53 - i've put this and organized it this way
266:55 - one of the fun things with semantic html
266:57 - is it does come down to interpretation
266:59 - so i could actually see this as one
267:01 - paragraph with a span in it just to
267:03 - style them differently because you could
267:04 - say it's average distance 38 or you know
267:07 - whatever estimated travel time three
267:09 - days you could read that as a single
267:11 - sentence but i do see these a little bit
267:13 - more like headings and then the
267:14 - information below it so it makes these
267:16 - two categories within the document
267:18 - outline now if we look at how these are
267:20 - always organized they are always grouped
267:22 - together and even here they do make two
267:24 - columns and to be able to keep these as
267:26 - two columns it will be important to sort
267:28 - of wrap them or have some spacing around
267:30 - them so i will come on each one of these
267:32 - and add in a div and then come over to
267:35 - the end and just close the div so we can
267:37 - wrap the content properly so now we have
267:40 - these two that can be kept together but
267:42 - i know i'm going to need something to
267:43 - actually make this into two columns as
267:45 - well because here they stack then here
267:47 - they go next to one another which to me
267:50 - generally means flex so i might as well
267:52 - come right away and add a div class
267:55 - is equal to flex here and then we can
267:57 - close my div here
268:00 - and just space those out and hit save
268:03 - and if we go and take a look we now have
268:04 - our two columns on there even though a
268:06 - lot more styling is required
268:08 - and one thing you might notice here is i
268:10 - didn't give these classes we might need
268:12 - to add classes if we need to manipulate
268:14 - the middle but as long as i have my div
268:16 - class flex here we don't have to give
268:18 - divs classes if we don't need them
268:20 - they're doing their job of dividing our
268:21 - content into two blocks and they're just
268:24 - there to structurally organize our
268:25 - content so in cases like this don't feel
268:28 - like you need to give a div a class it
268:30 - does sometimes seem weird seeing divs
268:32 - without them but we don't always need
268:33 - them so there we go i think that's
268:36 - looking good
268:37 - if you haven't already taken the
268:39 - challenges that i've been giving you or
268:40 - you haven't styled things up go through
268:42 - all of this and now add in all the
268:44 - utility classes to set our font sizes
268:46 - and different things that you might need
268:47 - and then i'll share my own solution with
268:49 - you when you're done
268:52 - all right so let's come up on here and
268:53 - give this a class is equal to font size
268:56 - 800 because it's nice and super big but
268:58 - not the biggest one that we have we also
269:00 - will want this to be uppercase and to be
269:02 - my font family songs i'm not saying i
269:05 - should say sarah so we can see the
269:07 - larger and smaller font sizes so i think
269:08 - that's looking pretty good and that's
269:10 - coming together the paragraph i think is
269:13 - perfectly fine and we don't need to add
269:14 - any styling on that but these guys at
269:16 - the bottom we clearly do because there
269:18 - are some differences going on in there
269:20 - so let's come on this my two h3s are
269:23 - styled the same
269:25 - and so let's take a look perfection and
269:28 - then we can come on to these two
269:29 - paragraphs right here case on there so
269:32 - i'm going to add it there and we'll take
269:34 - a look and that's looking good what's it
269:36 - yeah you can see the km is uppercase
269:38 - there so there we go that's looking good
269:40 - i think it's looking pretty good here as
269:42 - well at the different sizes so it's
269:44 - looking pretty good except for this
269:46 - which is actually i'm looking at it
269:47 - going you know what
269:49 - that's supposed to be getting smaller
269:50 - and so let's go look really fast add our
269:53 - index.css go all the way up to our font
269:55 - sizes and that one is using our font
269:57 - size 500 which is our numbered title and
270:00 - what i think is that this should have
270:03 - actually changed at the different screen
270:05 - sizes so i'm going to take the font size
270:07 - 500 here and bring it into our largest
270:09 - media query and drop it right there
270:11 - which is where it should be and then we
270:14 - can come in and make these modifications
270:15 - so this would be a font size 500 which
270:18 - would go down to a
270:20 - 1.25 rem which comes out to 20 pixels
270:23 - and then here the font size 500 will
270:25 - actually go down to one ram just like
270:27 - that and if we hit save and then go take
270:30 - a look at it
270:31 - that is looking a little bit better and
270:33 - matching the design a bit more where we
270:35 - get these smaller font sizes when we're
270:38 - at that small screen size and i think
270:39 - we'll make a little bit easier to match
270:42 - the layout that we're going for so i do
270:44 - apologize for that ahead of time but i
270:47 - do think that should make things work a
270:49 - little bit better and now that we have
270:51 - that done it is time to take the layout
270:53 - and make it happen and since we already
270:55 - have a grid i'm going to be using it so
270:57 - we can come and delete that if you want
270:59 - right now and then go ahead and start
271:02 - making things happen i'm just letting
271:04 - you know that i will be using graded
271:06 - template areas quite heavily for this
271:08 - because it's just going to make life so
271:09 - easy to get everything to go where we
271:11 - want it to and those grid template areas
271:13 - will be placed on the grid container
271:14 - here if you have experience with grid
271:16 - and you want to play with this or if you
271:18 - want to take what you learned from when
271:19 - we did the home page and apply it here
271:21 - if you'd rather follow along with me and
271:22 - do more smaller challenges along the way
271:24 - i'll be starting in the next lesson with
271:26 - the mobile screen size of this and then
271:28 - over a few lessons we'll break down the
271:30 - different screen sizes and get
271:32 - everything working for this layout so
271:34 - whenever you're ready i'll see you in
271:35 - that next lesson
271:39 - all right so it's time to make the
271:40 - layout come to life which is always an
271:42 - exciting time i'm going to delete this
271:43 - that we have right here and then hit
271:45 - save to make our layout come to life and
271:47 - let's break things a little bit because
271:48 - things are trying to squeeze into
271:49 - columns they're not supposed to be
271:51 - living on and it actually causes a bit
271:53 - of overflow because of the max width
271:55 - that we've
271:57 - placed on items that are in our grid so
271:59 - our image is causing some issues right
272:01 - now but that's going to be fixed shortly
272:03 - just because we need to get it to be
272:04 - smaller anyway you can see that we have
272:06 - a lot of white space around that image
272:08 - so a lot of the problems that we're
272:10 - seeing now will be solved without too
272:12 - much work so let's go over to our css to
272:14 - fix things up and
272:16 - right now we had our grid container here
272:18 - with our good container home
272:20 - and i do think it's going to make things
272:22 - a little bit easier in the long run um
272:25 - depending on how we want to do it you
272:26 - can pull this whole grid container piece
272:28 - out and this is becoming much more of a
272:30 - component than it is a utility class so
272:33 - i think what i might do is actually take
272:34 - this entire thing here just to keep
272:36 - organization a little bit easier and
272:38 - bring it all the way down
272:40 - and create a new category down here so
272:42 - we're going to paste that back in
272:44 - and then i'll grab this here and we're
272:46 - going to put in layout
272:48 - and this is really more layout related
272:50 - things so we can write that right here
272:52 - layout and then we can come back down
272:54 - here and so we have our good container
272:56 - which is our main layout and then we do
272:57 - have these modifications that are going
272:59 - to be coming in so all of this is
273:00 - related to the different
273:02 - pieces and parts of everything and right
273:04 - here we will come in and say that this
273:06 - is my
273:07 - destination layout
273:10 - because we clearly need to make a few
273:12 - changes right now and these changes
273:14 - don't necessarily apply to all of the
273:16 - pages and so let's start with this one
273:19 - and we can come down and say this is my
273:21 - grid container sd nation and as i said i
273:24 - want to rely heavily on grid template
273:27 - areas for this we already have a display
273:29 - grid that's applied here so we can just
273:30 - come in right away and say our grid
273:32 - template areas
273:34 - and on these grid template areas i
273:36 - always like breaking them down onto a
273:38 - new line and then writing them because
273:39 - it makes life a lot easier and we don't
273:41 - actually really need to declare it at
273:43 - this point because it is um
273:46 - so straightforward but
273:48 - we i like doing it at this point and
273:50 - then redefining it just because i find
273:51 - that it's a little bit more clear what's
273:53 - actually happening
273:54 - so then we can do our tabs and then we
273:57 - can do the content itself so i'll call
273:59 - it content it could be body
274:01 - it could be different things but i'll
274:02 - say
274:03 - sort of content the main content area
274:05 - for this grid template areas and if we
274:08 - go back to our moon here that would be
274:09 - everything that is inside of this
274:11 - article right here
274:12 - and to make life easier let's come in
274:14 - and give this a class and we'll give
274:16 - this the class
274:17 - of destination
274:20 - so we just make it a little bit easier
274:22 - so we're not going to all the articles
274:24 - just in case that not that i think this
274:27 - will be the only article that is within
274:29 - our grid container destination but it
274:31 - just makes life a little bit easier to
274:33 - select it
274:34 - so uh yeah that's what we can do for the
274:37 - grid template areas and now what i'm
274:39 - going to do is let's jump in and start
274:41 - with our number title and say that this
274:42 - has a grid area of title and this could
274:46 - technically break things and you'll
274:47 - notice here it's in quotations and here
274:49 - it's not that's just how grid areas work
274:51 - with the number title i'm saying this
274:54 - assuming it's always living on the grid
274:55 - if ever you had a number title that was
274:57 - outside of the grid this would just be
274:59 - invalid and wouldn't work
275:01 - you could
275:02 - take like raise the
275:04 - raise this a little bit by saying this
275:06 - and then it's only gonna work if it's in
275:08 - the grid container but it's only gonna
275:10 - work anyway and with the scope of this
275:13 - project i feel safe with this and so
275:15 - we'll keep on going and i'm gonna go
275:18 - like this with grid destination img so
275:20 - i'm really just selecting my image that
275:21 - is inside of my grid destination and if
275:24 - you wanted to be very sure that you're
275:26 - getting the right thing just in case
275:27 - multiple images would come in we could
275:28 - do that or of course this could have a
275:30 - class but with the layout the wave here
275:33 - it's clearly just one image that's
275:34 - coming into this grid so i feel like
275:37 - once again comfortable with this and
275:38 - this scopes whatever styles i put on
275:40 - here to here so we can see that this has
275:42 - a grid area of image and along with that
275:45 - we can give this a max width of like 60
275:48 - or something like that and i think that
275:50 - will actually look pretty good so let's
275:52 - go and see what that would look like
275:54 - where there we go we get our moon
275:55 - sitting right there in the middle and
275:57 - it's looking pretty nice and already you
275:59 - can see this is pretty close to what we
276:01 - need so that's kind of exciting and you
276:03 - know i'm pretty happy with that so let's
276:05 - keep on going with that though we have
276:06 - our grid destination image and we could
276:08 - even like you could have this here and
276:11 - that would work but this is going to be
276:13 - working for all of them so i actually
276:14 - you know what this number title with the
276:16 - grid area here i guess could actually
276:18 - come up we have this this
276:20 - we could place it here just because it
276:22 - becomes something that's very generic
276:24 - and is going to be applied to all of the
276:26 - grids that we're using so i'll leave it
276:28 - there just because this is destination
276:29 - layout only
276:31 - then the next one we have is our grid
276:34 - container destination and then we want
276:37 - to select our we'll start with the tab
276:39 - list and so that gets the grid
276:42 - area of tabs
276:44 - and then i'm just going to copy this to
276:46 - speed things up a little bit
276:49 - and then the last one that we have here
276:51 - is our
276:52 - uh hummingbird our deskt nation info
276:56 - here this class is going to be unique to
276:58 - this page whereas tab list could be in
277:00 - other pages which is why i like scoping
277:02 - it here
277:04 - and same with this so using a descendant
277:06 - selector which effectively scopes it to
277:08 - here is going to help us out uh in this
277:11 - case we don't want this to be tab so we
277:12 - want this to be in our content and so
277:14 - you know we're raising the specificity
277:16 - on that so i could do this because once
277:18 - again this is unique to here but it's
277:20 - not going to hurt anything to have this
277:21 - and it just makes it a little bit more
277:23 - clear that we're making sure that we're
277:24 - relying on this grid
277:26 - so that's why i'm doing it this way it
277:28 - does mean it's higher specificity if
277:30 - ever i wanted to overwrite it but if i
277:32 - wanted to overwrite it i wouldn't be
277:34 - doing it in my grid container
277:35 - destination and then placing it within
277:37 - there so this i think if somebody were
277:39 - to come along this code later on makes
277:41 - it a little bit more clear what's
277:43 - happening and the higher specificity
277:45 - really shouldn't get in the way so to me
277:47 - this makes a lot of sense um the last
277:50 - thing that is kind of important right
277:52 - now is if we look here we have this flex
277:54 - and they are actually going next to one
277:56 - one another which we don't want to
277:57 - happen so if we go and look at my markup
278:00 - here this was just a flex and what i'm
278:02 - actually going to add to this
278:03 - i'm going to call this planet
278:06 - meta because it's sort of or it could
278:07 - even be just it will stick with
278:08 - destination destination
278:11 - meta um just so we're consistent with
278:13 - our naming throughout so destination
278:15 - meta because it's like the meta
278:16 - information for the destination that
278:18 - we're going to
278:19 - and
278:20 - you know we could choose you we could be
278:23 - going along the whole like grid
278:24 - container destination and then choosing
278:26 - the flex class
278:27 - um but i do like having this is sort of
278:29 - like this little mini component so i do
278:31 - think having its own class on here is a
278:34 - little bit more useful than doing that
278:36 - and like here it's an image that's in
278:38 - here but then we have my tab list we
278:40 - have my destination info we're being
278:41 - very specific where is that dot flex
278:44 - like um i don't know to me it's a bridge
278:46 - too far but i won't nest this i'm just
278:48 - going to say that it's just
278:50 - dusty nation meta and you might be going
278:52 - well kevin all of this is nested
278:55 - on
278:56 - with this right we're using all these
278:58 - descendant selectors and then we're not
278:59 - doing it here and because this is
279:01 - nothing to do with how it's laying out
279:03 - on the grid i don't feel like nesting it
279:06 - achieves anything it's still very clear
279:07 - what's happening where it's my
279:09 - destination meta the description of this
279:12 - class is very telling and what it does i
279:14 - should easily be able to find it and
279:16 - these are very grid related things i'm
279:18 - placing this on my grid so i'm saying
279:20 - that this on my grid is doing this
279:22 - whereas here it says something where i'm
279:24 - going to change the flex direction
279:26 - and we're going to make that
279:27 - column which should make those rows and
279:30 - then there we go they're actually
279:32 - stacking one on top of each other which
279:34 - is fantastic the next thing up on my
279:37 - flex direction column that i'm going to
279:38 - do is let's come in with a border top
279:41 - and we'll say it's a 1 pixel solid and
279:44 - we'll use our hsl once again it is a
279:46 - little bit different in the design file
279:48 - but um i'm gonna come in with this
279:50 - because i think it's gonna be a little
279:50 - bit more consistent and give us pretty
279:52 - much the color that we want it to be so
279:54 - i'm happy with that maybe we could go
279:56 - down on here to like a point one
279:58 - uh and get exactly what we're after and
280:00 - then we can come in with some padding
280:02 - top on that of 2.5 rim and then we can
280:05 - also do a margin top of 2.5 rim so it's
280:09 - just equal distance on both sides of
280:10 - that and there we go we got our nice
280:12 - line that's coming in and i've also
280:13 - realized the font size on these is wrong
280:16 - but we'll address that in a future video
280:18 - because it is the right size at the
280:19 - large screen sizes it's just um the
280:22 - media queries we have for them it's
280:23 - getting too small at small sizes so
280:26 - we'll definitely address that as time is
280:27 - coming
280:29 - and one more thing i'm going to do is we
280:31 - definitely need some spacing on here and
280:33 - there's a few different ways that we
280:35 - could introduce that spacing so i'm
280:37 - going to give that to you as a little
280:39 - challenge to finish this one off and
280:40 - once you're happy with your own solution
280:42 - i'll come in and show you what mine
280:43 - would be
280:46 - all right so we have a few different
280:47 - ways that we could do this one of them
280:48 - would be to introduce a road gap and
280:50 - that would work but we've already done
280:51 - the hard work of creating our flow
280:54 - classes
280:55 - so here on my main we can come in and we
280:58 - can introduce a flow class on there and
281:00 - that right away is going to introduce
281:02 - some spacing which is a nice start and
281:05 - the next thing we could do is we could
281:06 - either come in with an inline style to
281:08 - increase it or because we've already
281:09 - taken the time and we have our
281:12 - destination here another thing we could
281:14 - do is come in and give our flow space
281:17 - and come in with a two rim to increase
281:19 - the total amount of spacing there and i
281:21 - think right away that looks much much
281:23 - better and much closer to what the
281:25 - design was looking for and i'm pretty
281:28 - happy with that overall the last thing
281:30 - that we have an issue with is just the
281:31 - space on the bottom over here and we
281:33 - never ran into that on the home page and
281:36 - to me the easiest way to handle that is
281:38 - to go on our grid container itself so
281:40 - it's all the grid containers and come in
281:42 - with a padding bottom because this won't
281:44 - affect the bottom on the
281:47 - um you know whatever number you want to
281:49 - come in here with it's just going to
281:51 - give us that breathing room that we need
281:53 - here at the bottom which is going to
281:55 - make life a lot better because we
281:56 - definitely need some there when people
281:58 - scroll down or else it's just really
281:59 - awkward
282:01 - and even on the index page that might
282:03 - solve a bit of a problem we had where
282:05 - when we were hovering before sometimes
282:07 - we were running into issues where that
282:08 - could actually cause an overflow uh
282:12 - and be kind of awkward where the scroll
282:13 - bar would jump in and out so that sort
282:15 - of helps us prevent that problem and
282:17 - even at bigger screen sizes having a
282:19 - little bit of padding at the bottom it's
282:21 - not going to greatly affect things and
282:23 - it still lets us keep the overall layout
282:25 - in everything that we're having so it's
282:26 - a little bit of a compromise there could
282:28 - be a way where we target more specific
282:30 - pages with this but i think it's the
282:32 - easiest way to tackle it myself but if
282:35 - you would rather see something that's
282:36 - more specific for certain pages you
282:37 - could approach this in a different way
282:39 - as well
282:40 - and with that i'm actually really happy
282:41 - because i think we've tackled our mobile
282:43 - layout really well the tablet layout is
282:45 - almost exactly the same so i think we
282:47 - can do the tablet layout and this one
282:49 - all in the next lesson if you want to go
282:51 - ahead and try those out before i get
282:53 - there and then when you're done with
282:55 - that you want to see my solution i'll be
282:56 - looking at that in the next lesson
283:01 - so our mobile layout is looking pretty
283:02 - good we want to move into this area here
283:05 - where there's not very many changes one
283:07 - of them is the title goes from center
283:08 - align to left align and another thing
283:10 - that happens is the
283:13 - area down here breaks from one column to
283:15 - two columns but other than that
283:16 - everything is basically the same thing
283:18 - that we have right here so there aren't
283:20 - a lot of adjustments that we have to do
283:23 - and let's come here and we're going to
283:24 - add in that middle breakpoint of an add
283:26 - media and we'd say a min width of 35 m
283:31 - and on that i am going to select my
283:33 - number title and the reason it's in the
283:35 - middle is because of the alignment of
283:37 - what's happening right now because this
283:39 - is on a grid and if you remember when we
283:41 - set it all up for smaller screen sizes
283:43 - and our mobile screen sizes we said
283:45 - everything should just be centered that
283:46 - was working and it still is working for
283:48 - most things but it's not working for the
283:50 - number title right now and so even if
283:52 - you tried a text a line left it's not
283:54 - actually going to change anything if we
283:56 - go and take a look it's still stuck
283:58 - right in the middle so
284:00 - how would you go about moving that over
284:03 - to the left side i'm going to leave that
284:05 - up to you to see if you can come up with
284:06 - a solution
284:09 - so because we are in grid and this is a
284:11 - lot like flex we said everything is
284:13 - justified a center and so we can't say
284:15 - justify itself and justify itself is not
284:17 - something we have in flex but it is
284:18 - something we have in grid and we need to
284:20 - say start and if we do that and we go
284:22 - take a look it's lined up all the way at
284:24 - the start so here it's looking pretty
284:26 - good then we get to the break point it's
284:27 - there and then it just stays left
284:29 - aligned which is perfect there is this
284:31 - awkward point there that's going to be
284:32 - fixed really easily as well the other
284:34 - thing though that i would like to
284:36 - address is just the um spacing that's
284:38 - happening here right now and if we go
284:40 - and look at the layouts here there is a
284:41 - bit of space and then that space does
284:43 - increase and already that space is
284:45 - increasing because we're adding a margin
284:47 - top and bottom here let's just take
284:49 - advantage of that extra spacing because
284:50 - we want it both times anyway and we just
284:52 - say that we have a margin
284:55 - top or if you do want to stay we've been
284:57 - doing margin block and margin inline you
284:59 - can do a margin block start which is
285:01 - just the top so if you do want to stay
285:04 - with the logical properties you can do
285:06 - that but just to stay consistent since
285:08 - we've been using top and bottom
285:09 - everywhere we'll add a two ram of margin
285:11 - here on the top so now these medium
285:13 - screen sizes we have that space that's
285:16 - good now we just have to address this
285:18 - problem down at the bottom which is very
285:20 - easy to do and you'll even see the
285:22 - alignment is just completely off and
285:23 - let's go look here hmm
285:26 - we might have some weird alignment
285:27 - issues that are happening and i know why
285:29 - those are happening we might see this
285:30 - across other pages too so we're going to
285:32 - address that shortly but for now let's
285:34 - just fix this so it does go across two
285:36 - columns
285:37 - so that is my destination meta so in
285:40 - this same media query we can come in
285:43 - we only need to do one thing we can
285:45 - delete most of these leave one of them
285:47 - and make a change here so what is that
285:48 - that we need to change i'll let you do
285:50 - that and then i'll take a look at it as
285:51 - well
285:53 - and that one thing that we needed to
285:55 - change is just coming in here and saying
285:57 - that this should be a row instead
286:00 - of course when we do that things sort of
286:01 - break a little bit but the row is
286:03 - working where they're going one next to
286:04 - each other and that is perfect
286:07 - so if we come and take a look they
286:08 - should be spaced out a lot more is there
286:10 - a way just with flexbox that we could
286:12 - sort of keep that with our spacing so
286:14 - i'll let you give that a try and then
286:16 - we'll take a look at how we can do that
286:19 - and i'm going to come in with a
286:21 - justify content and i will come in with
286:23 - a space evenly and space evenly was the
286:26 - last one that was added and it's the one
286:27 - that you have space between space around
286:30 - and space evenly uh space around sort of
286:33 - is very similar to space evenly but
286:35 - space evenly is usually the one that you
286:36 - want so with the small sizes i think
286:38 - it's looking alright everything is okay
286:40 - we get to this larger screen size it's
286:42 - looking pretty good we still need to fix
286:44 - these font sizes we'll get there don't
286:46 - worry and then we get to this larger
286:48 - size where now this is where the next
286:51 - adjustments have to happen so there's
286:53 - quite a bit of different things that are
286:55 - happening here so i'll let you try and
286:57 - solve all of those things and see if you
286:59 - can get things working and i'll see you
287:00 - in the next lesson
287:04 - all right so let's get our big layout
287:06 - going and we're going to be doing a lot
287:07 - of as i said with grid template areas
287:10 - so one thing we're going to have to pay
287:11 - a bit of attention to here is let's
287:13 - paste this in and delete this and then
287:15 - let's take a look at how our areas are
287:17 - even set up so if you remember we have
287:19 - the left and the right are set up with
287:21 - these which are sort of like the the
287:23 - extremities where nothing should live we
287:25 - want everything living in this area here
287:28 - so what we can say is we're going to
287:30 - actually come here and say dot and then
287:32 - title and title and then a dot and the
287:35 - dot is like a empty area so we have our
287:37 - empty area then we have title across one
287:40 - title across two and then going across
287:42 - into we have nothing over here
287:45 - so in all of these we're going to start
287:47 - them all with a dot and we can actually
287:49 - delete this last one because what we
287:51 - want is our title all the way across the
287:53 - top then we want our
287:55 - planet here
287:57 - and we have our tabs and we have this
287:58 - content so our planet is actually going
288:01 - to go across two of these so let's go
288:03 - and take a look at that we have our
288:05 - image and then our image right there
288:07 - and then after the image we can have our
288:09 - tabs
288:10 - and then the dot for the empty area
288:12 - that's left over
288:13 - and then here we have our image and we
288:15 - have our content and then the empty area
288:17 - that's left over
288:19 - and just by doing that let's go take a
288:21 - look at what that's done and oh my
288:22 - goodness it's looking pretty good
288:25 - my we did we barely did anything and i'm
288:28 - super happy with how that's looking
288:30 - so that's a really uh nice surprise i
288:33 - think this is one of the reasons i
288:35 - really love grid areas and then we come
288:37 - in with our justify and if you remember
288:40 - we'd originally a long time ago changed
288:42 - the justify items so we're going to come
288:44 - with the justify items until we start on
288:45 - that instead of center so then
288:48 - just here everything is centered then we
288:50 - want it all to go more left aligned so
288:52 - if we go and take a look that's working
288:54 - for almost everything except down here
288:57 - which is using flex but let's just see
288:59 - here we're pretty happy with that then
289:01 - we pop over to here
289:02 - and why is my title not actually working
289:05 - let's take a quick look at that
289:07 - and actually what's causing that is this
289:09 - here with our grid container first child
289:11 - and last child that we were doing to
289:12 - create those two columns there so we
289:14 - will come in and fix that just by saying
289:16 - that's only for our home layout
289:19 - and home and because we're doing that
289:21 - and fixing that only for our home
289:23 - because all the other ones we'll be
289:24 - using
289:25 - uh grid template areas on anyway we can
289:27 - come and fix that like that
289:29 - and now if we go and take a look we can
289:31 - see there we go that looks a little bit
289:33 - better where it's actually stretching
289:35 - across the top
289:36 - uh another thing we have to fix is our
289:38 - image so here we can say
289:40 - we want to use the same selector because
289:42 - we're overwriting what we've already set
289:44 - right here
289:45 - so i can use that same selector right
289:48 - here and then change the max width
289:51 - now to 100 to let that image actually
289:54 - grow and it does look a little bit big
289:56 - so maybe we'll actually come in with
289:57 - like an 80
289:58 - uh or a 90
290:00 - just to make sure that it doesn't get
290:02 - too large another way we could
290:03 - accomplish the same thing is by setting
290:05 - a bigger gap here down the middle and
290:08 - yeah i think that works out really
290:09 - nicely we can drop down to the tablet
290:11 - layout and it's looking good and then we
290:12 - get to here and i think that's working
290:15 - really really nicely now the last thing
290:17 - we sort of need to fix up is this guy
290:19 - right here and so to be able to do that
290:22 - let's go and take a look and we just
290:24 - need that one to be left aligned and to
290:26 - fix those font sizes at long last so to
290:29 - get those left aligned i'm going to
290:30 - leave it for you to see if you can
290:31 - figure out how to do that and then i'll
290:34 - take a look at it in a second
290:38 - all right so that is my destination meta
290:42 - if you remember properly so what i will
290:43 - do is just take this right here once
290:46 - again we'll drop it down here
290:48 - and the flex direction can stay like
290:51 - that but my justified content we're
290:52 - going to do is put a start on there just
290:55 - so it goes to the left alignment instead
290:57 - of spacing everything out but we'll also
291:00 - come in and we'll use our gap property
291:03 - here let's increase it after like a
291:05 - three rem to add that spacing in between
291:08 - those two elements and i think we could
291:10 - actually increase it more to about a six
291:13 - and there we go i'm super happy with
291:15 - that and that's looking really good
291:18 - and the last thing to do is the font
291:20 - size that's coming on here and i
291:21 - actually made a change early on uh on
291:24 - one of the elements also on the home
291:25 - page where we're having an issue with a
291:28 - font size which was our explore button
291:31 - and if you remember when we did the
291:32 - explore button we were just we took the
291:34 - font size property off because it wasn't
291:36 - giving us the size we needed and we just
291:37 - explicitly set it so i'm going to do the
291:40 - same thing here we're going to delete
291:41 - this and delete this one right there
291:44 - and in this case i'm going to use my
291:46 - destination meta and choose my
291:48 - paragraphs
291:49 - there could be
291:50 - if you want to create a class that just
291:52 - has a fixed font size that is something
291:54 - that we can do as well but for me it's a
291:56 - very unique case through the entire site
291:59 - so we'll grab that we'll come over to my
292:01 - index and so for my destination media
292:04 - paragraphs and not the one that's here
292:06 - we don't want to be working in a media
292:08 - query because the font size should
292:09 - always be the same so then we can come
292:11 - in with our dusty destination meta
292:15 - and say that a paragraph that is nested
292:18 - inside of there will have the font size
292:21 - of 1.75
292:23 - rem and so let's go and take a look and
292:25 - there we go we have the proper font size
292:27 - that's on there and as the screen size
292:29 - gets smaller that font size is staying
292:32 - the same across the board one more
292:34 - change i do want to add here a very
292:36 - small thing we can't really see it here
292:38 - but if you're on a computer with a much
292:40 - larger screen than what i'm working with
292:42 - at the moment um if you got to these
292:44 - large sizes or the screen was much
292:46 - taller than what we have here everything
292:48 - would start sort of pulling away from
292:50 - each other a little bit so just to
292:52 - address that the easiest way is here on
292:54 - our justify items start i will come in
292:56 - here with an align content start which
292:59 - we won't see the difference as i said at
293:01 - all right now in within the editor that
293:04 - i'm using but if you're on a larger
293:06 - screen it's just going to keep all the
293:07 - content sort of together at the top
293:09 - instead of slowly stretching out
293:12 - as the page size increases so yeah i
293:15 - just think for bigger screens that will
293:16 - be an important change to make and
293:18 - lastly the thing we want to address is
293:20 - these alignment issues that can be
293:22 - cropping up where things are working
293:24 - super well there and as i mentioned
293:25 - earlier it has also found its way under
293:28 - the homepage with this right there and
293:30 - so you know that doesn't look very nice
293:32 - when that happens
293:34 - and it's just way off to the side so
293:35 - this could be a nice opportunity to dive
293:37 - in see if you can figure out what's
293:38 - actually causing that and see if you can
293:40 - fix it on your own before i show you my
293:42 - solution in the next video
293:46 - all right so i won't lie this was a
293:48 - little bit of a tricky one and the
293:51 - what's actually the culprit here is this
293:53 - grid container with our star with a max
293:56 - width of 50. and to be able to highlight
293:58 - what's happening i'm going to come on
293:59 - here and we're going to give this an
294:00 - outline and we're going to say 3 pixels
294:03 - solid lime green because that should
294:05 - really stand out on our background
294:07 - and if we go and take a look we can see
294:09 - all these boxes that have been drawn
294:10 - around everything because basically
294:11 - everything has an outline on it now and
294:14 - a few of these have very small font
294:16 - sizes on them and those small font sizes
294:18 - when we take a look at the smaller
294:20 - screen size right at oh look at that
294:22 - there's another problem there we'll
294:24 - solve that in this lesson as well but at
294:25 - these small screen sizes what's
294:27 - happening is you can actually see that
294:28 - the total distance here or the total
294:30 - width of this is less wide than the
294:32 - total width available to it because this
294:36 - has a max width on it a 50 ch and it's
294:38 - such a small font size and if we go and
294:41 - look at the home page and run that one
294:43 - again the same issue is happening here
294:46 - this font size is so small that 50 ch is
294:48 - actually smaller than this entire space
294:50 - that it has to live in
294:52 - and the reason we set this in the first
294:54 - place is because of this paragraph
294:56 - and other paragraphs to it whereas this
294:59 - is growing we're going to see we're
295:00 - getting this extra space on the sides
295:02 - here which is nice it's good that's what
295:04 - we want and if i come in here and i turn
295:07 - off this max width what happens is this
295:10 - now stretches the entire thing and it
295:12 - just it becomes a little bit harder to
295:13 - read if you're on a tablet and it was
295:15 - like this like it just doesn't look as
295:18 - fantastic as it could look so
295:21 - that's why we initially put that on
295:23 - there so now that you know what the
295:24 - issue was if you weren't able to solve
295:26 - it at the beginning see if you can find
295:27 - a way to make it work and only select
295:29 - those paragraphs
295:32 - i'm going to turn this max width back on
295:34 - so it's actually being applied and what
295:36 - i'm actually going to do is change this
295:38 - from a star selector to a p selector
295:41 - which is choosing all my paragraphs and
295:43 - in this case it's actually working on
295:45 - this page the only issue that can come
295:47 - up with that is if we go over to my
295:49 - other page it's selecting a few things
295:51 - that i might not want it to select and
295:53 - luckily that's actually pretty easy to
295:55 - do where we can add one more thing here
295:57 - which is going to be not
295:59 - and then in the knot we can put in a
296:01 - class on an attribute selector so it's
296:04 - saying any paragraph that does not have
296:06 - a class applied to it and if we go and
296:08 - take a look we can see that's only
296:10 - applying to this here so it's leaving
296:12 - our max width set perfectly on that and
296:14 - if we go back to our index the same
296:16 - thing it's only being applied on that
296:18 - one and so we can see that it's only
296:20 - being applied here and if we go back to
296:22 - our index page we can see that it's only
296:24 - being applied right there and this is
296:26 - one of those ones i don't use very often
296:28 - but it can every now and then really
296:30 - come in handy so we can turn off our
296:32 - lime green because we don't need that
296:33 - anymore but as we saw we are running
296:36 - into a bit of a problem with this text
296:37 - over here when we hit a certain screen
296:39 - size which is right around here
296:41 - and that's happening for a very
296:43 - interesting reason we're running into
296:44 - these little issues that sort of pop
296:46 - their head up as you're working on a
296:48 - site that's very normal to happen and so
296:50 - i really want you to see if you can
296:52 - troubleshoot this one right here that
296:53 - we've just run into and see if you can
296:56 - solve that one as well
296:59 - all right so that is happening purely
297:01 - from one selector all the way down to
297:03 - the bottom we had which is our
297:05 - destination meta and that is because we
297:07 - have a very big gap on here and it's
297:09 - just running out of room and so it has
297:11 - to break onto different lines
297:14 - and so one solution here is to change
297:16 - this from six we could just make it a
297:17 - smaller value of course but i'm going to
297:19 - choose a min function and in the min
297:21 - function let's come in with like 15
297:23 - viewport width and we can do a six rem
297:26 - and what this means is choose whichever
297:28 - of these is smaller
297:30 - so if six if we're getting to a very big
297:33 - screen size then 15 viewport width will
297:35 - be really big and then it will choose
297:37 - the six because six will be smaller but
297:39 - if the screen size gets very small then
297:41 - the 15 viewport width will be smaller
297:43 - and it will choose this one instead so
297:45 - if we go and take a look it looks like
297:47 - 15 is already too big and that's not
297:49 - actually helping us maybe we need to
297:51 - drop that down let's try eight and just
297:53 - see what that looks like and uh there
297:55 - that looks already much better so we can
297:57 - see that it's shrinking down and ah
298:00 - that's actually working pretty good
298:01 - now i am thinking that on these other
298:03 - planets we might run into larger
298:05 - distances so maybe we actually want to
298:08 - drop this down to like a five or a six
298:10 - just to make sure that there is enough
298:12 - distance and we don't have to readjust
298:14 - it maybe we will we'll see when we get
298:15 - there and once all of these different
298:17 - numbers are brought into there but right
298:20 - away i think we've hit a nice zone there
298:22 - we've solved a couple of problems that
298:24 - have reared their head and as i said i'm
298:26 - not going to add the functionality to
298:28 - this yet we'll cycle through the pages
298:30 - we'll put the layout for the next page
298:32 - in place and then we'll come back
298:33 - through and go and add the functionality
298:36 - where we can actually use these tabs
298:38 - that we've created right here so if you
298:39 - want to make any adjustments look at any
298:41 - of the code in here
298:42 - take a break for a little while and
298:44 - whatever it is when you're ready i'll be
298:46 - waiting for you in the next lesson
298:50 - and this one is another fun one very
298:53 - similar to the last one that we worked
298:54 - on and of course we have multiple
298:56 - different ones and unlike the tab system
298:58 - this time we have the dots to be able to
299:00 - go through the different crew members
299:02 - and then of course we have all the
299:03 - different sizes to worry about as well
299:05 - where things clearly get moved around a
299:07 - little bit more than on the last one
299:09 - because here we have an image on the top
299:10 - the image goes to the bottom and then
299:12 - the image goes to the side instead of
299:14 - always staying in the same place which
299:16 - makes things a little bit more
299:18 - interesting so i'm going to start we can
299:20 - jump over here to the crew commander
299:22 - page and i think you can do a lot of
299:24 - this all on your own you might run into
299:26 - little problems here and there along the
299:28 - way and that's where i'll be coming in
299:30 - and helping out because in a few seconds
299:32 - i'll come through and add in a lot of
299:34 - the markup and the utility classes to
299:36 - this page to get us started before we
299:38 - get into the layouts
299:42 - all right so for this one i'm actually
299:43 - going to go over to the moon page to get
299:46 - a lot of what we're going to be doing
299:47 - it's like last time i'm actually going
299:48 - to start at the main so we can go from
299:50 - the main
299:51 - all the way up
299:52 - and hit copy on that and then we can
299:54 - come over into my
299:56 - crew commander page and we can do
299:58 - everything from we'll start right here
300:01 - and hit paste
300:03 - then of course this is opening my main
300:05 - so we just want to make sure that we do
300:06 - close the main and of course this time
300:09 - it's grid container and it will be crew
300:11 - instead and we'll come up up over to the
300:13 - body and make sure that is true as well
300:16 - and let's run that page and we should
300:18 - see things are starting to show up in
300:20 - there at least now the next thing is we
300:22 - need to bring in all of the different uh
300:25 - tags and utility classes on here so if
300:27 - you waited for me for this step you can
300:29 - go ahead and do that now i'm gonna go a
300:31 - little bit quicker for this because it's
300:32 - to be very similar to the last one that
300:35 - we looked at so i'm going to bring in
300:37 - all of the tags and utility classes at
300:39 - once instead of talking my way through
300:41 - it just because it is so similar to
300:43 - everything we've been doing up until
300:46 - now right so i have most of the things
300:49 - in place the last thing i'm going to do
300:51 - is just come up and
300:52 - go on over to the design system and we
300:55 - can grab this right here because we need
300:58 - our dot indicators and drop back up over
301:00 - to here and paste that in
301:04 - and we will need a couple of extra
301:06 - buttons so let's copy that button and
301:07 - paste it in and this time we do have
301:09 - these slide titles where i'm going to
301:11 - change this one to be
301:14 - the commander
301:16 - and there we go we have the commander
301:17 - mission specialist pilot and the crew
301:20 - engineer and so again these are in an sr
301:22 - only class so they will not be visible
301:25 - but for a screen reader that comes along
301:27 - when these tabs are there it's going to
301:29 - make it so they sort of have an idea of
301:31 - what they're clicking on so they'd get
301:33 - to meet your crew and then this is going
301:35 - to be the selected one so they're going
301:36 - to know they're on the commander and
301:38 - then we have the commander information
301:40 - here and then we get to the mission
301:41 - specialist the pilot the crew engineer
301:44 - one thing quickly before we get into the
301:47 - layout something that ideally i would
301:49 - want to do is actually to have
301:52 - this content and the image inside that
301:56 - article because this image is very
301:57 - related to what's happening here
301:59 - obviously but because of the layout
302:01 - differences that are happening where the
302:03 - dots are sort of we have the image then
302:05 - the dots then the content are then over
302:07 - on this one then the image is dropping
302:09 - below and we have the dots and then the
302:11 - content and then here things are
302:12 - breaking up it's always organized in
302:14 - very different ways be very difficult to
302:17 - be able to do that so i'm doing the
302:19 - image on its own over here i don't feel
302:22 - like it's an ideal situation but in the
302:24 - end it's one of those compromises i'm
302:26 - making to be able to actually execute
302:28 - the layout that we're trying to build
302:30 - so
302:31 - yeah that's why i'm excluding the image
302:33 - here is the same on the previous page
302:35 - why the images were the way they were
302:37 - and with all of this in place i do
302:39 - believe we're ready to work on the
302:41 - layout so i'll see you in the next
302:42 - lesson where we're going to do just that
302:46 - all right so before we were doing all of
302:48 - our work on the destination layout now
302:50 - let's come down right to here and come
302:52 - in with our crew layout and if you
302:55 - haven't already done it i'm going to
302:56 - challenge you to do as much of this as
302:59 - you can on your own and then just come
303:01 - to me for advice so i will move a little
303:03 - bit faster through this one than we did
303:06 - on the last one and we will be using a
303:08 - lot of grid template areas and a lot of
303:10 - very similar things
303:12 - to what we've already used um up until
303:15 - now
303:16 - so i'm going to leave this here for you
303:17 - i'll switch this over to crew for you
303:19 - and i'll see what you can do with this
303:21 - page and come in with your own solutions
303:23 - to this again i'm going to be going a
303:25 - little bit faster a little bit less
303:27 - explanation at this point because i
303:29 - think you should have these skills to be
303:31 - able to move forward and then if you do
303:32 - get stuck or there's small little things
303:34 - you can see how i do things a little bit
303:36 - differently hopefully to find the
303:38 - solutions to the problems that you've
303:39 - run into
303:40 - and so the first thing i'm going to do
303:42 - is actually also come up to here and
303:44 - take all of these and we have to make
303:46 - some changes to them but i'm going to
303:48 - grab these just to be able to work a
303:50 - little bit faster and drop them in here
303:52 - because once again we do want to have
303:55 - this could be my crew
303:57 - this one is going to be my crew and this
304:00 - will be my dot list
304:02 - and then we can come in with crew here
304:04 - and
304:05 - uh this is my crew info is what i
304:08 - believe i called it is it
304:11 - oh i put crew details okay we'll stick
304:13 - with for details maybe info would have
304:15 - been a better name but we'll stick with
304:17 - crew details on that one
304:20 - and the order of things is obviously a
304:22 - little bit different we have our title
304:24 - our image our tabs and actually maybe it
304:26 - is the same go ahead save here and let's
304:28 - go and take a look to see how things are
304:30 - looking comparatively to over here where
304:33 - hey it's not too bad actually
304:37 - uh so yeah not too bad at all we do have
304:39 - a color differences on a few things here
304:41 - that we need to fix we need to add a bit
304:43 - of flow i think and a bit of a border
304:46 - so i'm going to go ahead and do that um
304:49 - i did say on the previous one this is
304:51 - very related to grid content but i am
304:53 - going to stick here and just do a border
304:55 - bottom
304:57 - of one pixel solid and hsl
305:00 - with this one now because we are using a
305:02 - border in multiple cases where we had
305:04 - one previously on the meta description
305:08 - it was very similar even though i did
305:09 - this at the top
305:10 - this could be a utility class that you
305:12 - create and instead of doing it on here
305:14 - we could do it as a
305:16 - border top on this area over here so
305:19 - just to say there are different ways
305:20 - that we can skin a cat and approach
305:22 - these different things now the one issue
305:24 - with that is because i have a 60 on
305:26 - there it's not quite as long as we
305:29 - needed in the actual design but it's
305:30 - going to be close enough that i'm
305:32 - actually pretty happy with that
305:34 - but now we do have that issue where we
305:36 - get to here and the layout actually
305:37 - needs to change when we get to this
305:39 - tablet screen size
305:41 - so this is something we didn't have to
305:43 - do before but we can come in and take
305:46 - this guy right here and once again we
305:48 - don't have to really redefine other
305:50 - things we only have to redefine
305:54 - our grid template areas which is always
305:56 - so nice to have to only be able to do so
305:59 - title is still going to be first then
306:01 - we're going to have our content and
306:03 - everything else is going to follow so
306:05 - the image moves all the way down to the
306:07 - bottom so let's come in with our image
306:09 - so we're going to cut and then the
306:11 - content of course is going to get moved
306:13 - up so we can make this one content and
306:15 - make this one here tabs and of course i
306:17 - need this last one right there so at the
306:20 - small screen sizes everything is the way
306:22 - it should be we get to the medium screen
306:24 - size here and then that's working we're
306:26 - re
306:26 - reorganizing our content and then when
306:29 - we get to the larger screen size but we
306:30 - still need to do that uh there is one
306:32 - more thing i'm going to do if we take a
306:34 - look this should always be stuck to the
306:36 - bottom of the page i am a little
306:38 - concerned what this might look like at
306:40 - really big screen sizes so
306:42 - while it should be stuck to the bottom
306:44 - of the page and that does mean that
306:45 - maybe on this one we've added that
306:48 - padding that we want to get rid of
306:49 - because we want to have our content
306:51 - stuck to the bottom
306:53 - i am going to leave that border bottom
306:55 - that we have here
306:57 - just as a bit of a precaution because i
306:59 - think it really large screen sizes it's
307:02 - going to be a little bit awkward no
307:03 - one's going to notice it if it's stuck
307:05 - to the bottom of the page but if we get
307:07 - to a very large page then we won't have
307:10 - any issues where it looks like this
307:12 - weird floating corpse at least this line
307:14 - does provide us that separation
307:16 - that could actually go a really long way
307:18 - into making things look better so let's
307:20 - take this one now we can come down into
307:22 - this media query
307:23 - and paste it in and redefine things so
307:26 - remember in this one we need the dots on
307:28 - the two sides so we have our title
307:30 - across the top
307:33 - then on this one we now need to have our
307:36 - um it's going to be our content and
307:38 - image and i'll come bring the dots in in
307:40 - a second
307:41 - then it's going to be our then it will
307:43 - be our tabs
307:45 - and our image and we don't need this
307:47 - last one down here and as i said we can
307:50 - come through now and bring in those dots
307:53 - you just say that these grid areas of
307:55 - the extremities are blank
307:58 - so with all that in place we should be
308:00 - able to come over
308:01 - open things up and look at that it's
308:03 - working not perfectly and i think my
308:05 - dots are in the wrong spot so let's just
308:07 - make sure
308:08 - i have the right set up on that one
308:10 - uh dot list oh there it is top in the k
308:14 - tours i did the same thing twice
308:16 - much better
308:18 - and
308:19 - we can see that things are looking
308:20 - pretty good we have one other change
308:23 - that i'm going to make which is
308:24 - interesting because it's the same as
308:26 - this one so i'm actually going to do a
308:28 - comma and say grid container
308:33 - image and just so we can save a little
308:35 - bit of lines of code there so my image
308:38 - isn't getting too small
308:40 - now one difference that you will notice
308:42 - right away from the main design is the
308:44 - name here is going all the way across
308:47 - and my name here is breaking across two
308:49 - columns again normally i would increase
308:52 - maybe my media queries just a little bit
308:55 - and these would be set to 40 ram each
308:56 - instead of 30 rem as their maximum size
308:59 - so that could actually have a nice uh
309:01 - could actually fix that as an issue
309:04 - another thing we could do is come in
309:05 - with a clamp on this to try and fix that
309:07 - from breaking on two lines but that
309:08 - might be something we'll address later
309:10 - on seeing how things work out and if
309:13 - they don't look too good
309:15 - and i do have two challenges now for you
309:17 - just to sort of put the finishing
309:18 - touches and there's a few little things
309:20 - that i think could be improved overall
309:22 - on this but the two challenges i have
309:24 - for you first of all is getting this at
309:26 - the large screen sizes and just making
309:28 - sure it's aligned all the way on the
309:29 - left side
309:30 - and the other thing is to make sure that
309:32 - the image is stuck to the bottom instead
309:35 - of being stuck right here
309:37 - and so i'll leave those two challenges
309:39 - to you in just a few seconds i'll look
309:42 - at the solution
309:46 - so sticking with my min width of 45 m
309:48 - here what we can do is choose my
309:51 - grid container crew and on there we can
309:53 - say my dot indicators and on those we
309:56 - want to say that there are justify self
309:58 - start on there and that should help pull
310:00 - them over to the end just like we did on
310:03 - our destination meta on the last one and
310:06 - now we can see that it is lining up the
310:07 - way we want it to and then here
310:10 - everything becomes centered once again
310:12 - and then to get the image on the bottom
310:14 - there's two different things one of them
310:16 - is we do have padding that's down there
310:17 - that is preventing it from being stuck
310:19 - all the way on the bottom
310:21 - so if you remember that padding is
310:22 - coming on my grid container right here
310:26 - and the grid container destination is a
310:28 - modification of that class
310:30 - so we could say i'm going to not do this
310:32 - at the smallest screen size but i am
310:35 - going to introduce it at the
310:37 - medium screen sizes and up
310:39 - on this one we could say that the
310:41 - padding
310:42 - bottom
310:43 - is zero
310:44 - and if we go take a look we've
310:45 - eliminated that space and as you can see
310:47 - you can but that border that was there
310:49 - is basically non-visible so that's
310:52 - looking pretty good and that's fixed
310:54 - that problem at this screen size but
310:56 - then when we get to this large screen
310:58 - size we still have it not actually
311:00 - touching the bottom
311:01 - and this is something that i did in the
311:04 - previous one because i didn't want to
311:05 - prevent the problem that could arise
311:07 - from this i actually think that maybe
311:09 - taking this step of keeping it like this
311:13 - could like at this screen size and the
311:14 - screen sizes we'll be looking at here
311:16 - while i'm previewing this i don't think
311:18 - we'll run into any issues with it
311:20 - but it's one of those things where at a
311:22 - very large screen size it could look a
311:24 - little bit strange so i think i would
311:26 - leave it like this personally but there
311:28 - is a way we could make sure that it's
311:30 - always stuck to the bottom so why don't
311:31 - you see if you can figure out what that
311:33 - is and then in a second i'll come and
311:35 - address that as well
311:38 - all right so for that one it would just
311:40 - be coming down and very similar to how
311:43 - we did this i can take the same thing
311:45 - change this over to just my image and
311:48 - then justify itself is left to right
311:49 - right now so we can do
311:51 - an image not an image and a line itself
311:54 - and throw an end on there and that means
311:57 - it's always going to be lined up to the
311:58 - bottom of the grid and so if we go and
312:00 - take a look you can see now it's stuck
312:02 - to the bottom uh no matter what and it
312:04 - should always be stuck to the bottom
312:05 - with how we set this up i'm just worried
312:08 - at very large screen sizes that some
312:10 - strange things might happen with how the
312:12 - layout is going to look on that one so
312:14 - i'll let you be the judge on that
312:16 - whether you want to keep it or not so
312:17 - i'm actually going to comment that out
312:19 - but if you would want to leave it then
312:21 - you could definitely leave it or if you
312:22 - want to find a way to make it not look
312:24 - too bad
312:25 - you could also take another approach on
312:27 - that one i wouldn't mind at all so
312:30 - i'll leave that one up to your own
312:31 - discretion and we have a few little
312:33 - finishing touches on the last two pages
312:35 - we've done just to make sure everything
312:37 - is looking good and then we'll be
312:38 - getting into the functionality in not
312:40 - too long
312:43 - all right so i just want to make a few
312:45 - very small little touches improvements
312:47 - before we add the functionality and one
312:49 - of those important ones i think we need
312:51 - to do that we haven't done yet is to
312:53 - come all the way up and to fix the
312:55 - backgrounds here so uh we have them all
312:58 - set up for the home page but i can copy
312:59 - this and do a paste and paste because we
313:02 - have two more pages that we need to set
313:03 - things up for and if you want to go
313:05 - ahead and switch them all you can now
313:07 - but this is pretty straightforward i
313:09 - think so i'm just going to jump right
313:10 - into it and i'm going to choose the home
313:13 - basically everywhere we have here and
313:15 - just switch that out for my destination
313:16 - page and then do the same thing for my
313:18 - group page so i'll see you in just a
313:20 - second
313:22 - and there we go we have my different
313:24 - backgrounds in place and so let's go
313:26 - start with our crew commander page and
313:27 - see
313:28 - i can already see how my background
313:30 - image has come in so that's looking
313:31 - pretty good and we should see the image
313:33 - is going to change
313:34 - it does so i'm pretty happy with that
313:37 - let's go next and look at our
313:40 - moon page that we have right here and we
313:42 - should see a nice background oh we have
313:44 - another mistake that's coming with these
313:45 - background colors which is
313:47 - i know why that happened
313:49 - i'm not sure if you remember because it
313:50 - was a long time ago that we'd set things
313:52 - up like this but why don't you see if
313:53 - you can find out why those background
313:54 - colors are there how they got there and
313:56 - if you can find a solution to fixing
313:58 - that little problem
314:01 - all right so this is one of those normal
314:03 - problems that sort of pops its head up
314:05 - as you're doing more and more work on a
314:06 - site so the reason that they did happen
314:09 - is when we made our design system we
314:10 - just had a solid background color on
314:12 - there and when you have buttons they
314:14 - have a default button color so this was
314:16 - an easy way to get rid of them but
314:18 - obviously we didn't want it so i'm going
314:20 - to remove that class from here in my
314:22 - design system even though we're finished
314:24 - with it just so i don't accidentally
314:26 - copy and paste it and run it into the
314:27 - same problem again in the future
314:30 - and then we can come over to my moon
314:32 - page here and take off all of these and
314:37 - there we go they're gone and if we take
314:38 - a look well now it's even worse
314:41 - so if you didn't find the solution
314:42 - before see if you can fix it now and
314:45 - then i'll look at the solution in just a
314:47 - second
314:48 - all right so that one was let's go up a
314:50 - little bit and we can find our underline
314:52 - indicators and basically all we have to
314:54 - say is background
314:56 - color that is transparent
314:59 - and if we do that it doesn't affect our
315:02 - navigation links at all because the
315:03 - navigation links didn't have a
315:04 - background color anyway and you can see
315:06 - it's fixed the problem that we had there
315:08 - so a nice little wind that didn't take
315:10 - very much work compared to the initial
315:12 - design i do feel like the gap that we
315:14 - put here was a little bit big i'm gonna
315:16 - see if you can remember how we made that
315:17 - gap and if you can fix it and this is
315:19 - not something i do specific to this page
315:21 - i would just do it for that component in
315:23 - general so
315:24 - i'll let leave you here and see if you
315:27 - can
315:28 - shrink that down a little bit
315:31 - so if you remember we did that using our
315:32 - padding right here and i said don't
315:34 - worry about doing it as like a general
315:36 - fix just do it on the element itself and
315:38 - that is on our navigation we actually
315:40 - increased that space by increasing our
315:43 - underlying gap in this case we don't
315:45 - actually have one if you did redefine
315:47 - your underlying gap somewhere else and
315:48 - that worked that's perfect but i'm
315:50 - actually going to come here and redefine
315:51 - it here as a 0.75 ram instead just to
315:54 - try and pull it a little bit closer and
315:56 - i think even a 0.5 ram would be exactly
315:59 - what we need there we go i think that
316:01 - looks a little bit better and as one
316:03 - last change that we're going to make
316:05 - before we move into the functionality is
316:08 - just the title here of commander if we
316:11 - go and look at the design we can see
316:13 - it's not actually using my accent color
316:14 - it's actually faded out and if you go
316:17 - into your design files in figma or
316:18 - sketch you'll see it's at about it's a
316:20 - white color but at about 50 opacity so
316:23 - see if you can find a nice way to be
316:25 - able to adjust that and in a second i'll
316:27 - look at fixing that last thing up
316:31 - so that is happening here on the crew
316:33 - details on the h2 and so we could give
316:36 - this a class but i think just choosing
316:38 - our h2 in crew details is good enough
316:41 - and so let's go and do that right now
316:43 - where we can jump on over here let's go
316:45 - down and find my
316:48 - layout and i even though this is more
316:49 - like typography related just because we
316:51 - do have these grid we have like a lot of
316:54 - things that are related we have my
316:56 - destination meta here then we get my
316:58 - crew layout i just think it makes sense
316:59 - to group it with all of this so this one
317:01 - was called my crew details and then i
317:04 - can choose my h2 that is in there and we
317:07 - can just on this one
317:09 - we could do two different things you
317:10 - could actually say the opacity
317:12 - is uh a 0.5 and that would work
317:14 - perfectly fine since it's all the text
317:16 - and it's just the text that you're
317:18 - fading out so if we did that it would
317:20 - work and you can see it's faded on out
317:22 - or of course you could change the color
317:24 - of it
317:25 - and use our hsl at 8.5 and that would
317:29 - have the exact same effect so if you did
317:31 - either one of those
317:33 - or you found another way to select it
317:35 - that would be perfectly fine but that's
317:37 - that last step that we needed to do
317:40 - just one really quick note i really
317:41 - don't mind doing these types of things
317:43 - with some descendant selectors it even
317:45 - forces people to take a certain approach
317:48 - if they needed to create a new one to
317:50 - make sure that they're following the
317:52 - a certain way of organizing your text
317:54 - that i think is important anyway so for
317:56 - me this works out really well again if
317:59 - you prefer a class on this instead of
318:01 - saying the h2 instead of crew details i
318:03 - completely understand that and there's a
318:05 - few different ways you could go about
318:07 - choosing the type of class you'd use
318:08 - there but i'm really happy with where
318:10 - we're at now i think the page is looking
318:13 - fantastic even though this is breaking
318:14 - on two lines to me that's not the end of
318:16 - the world even though in the design file
318:18 - it's not doing that we can always look
318:20 - later on once we add the functionality
318:22 - if we see that things are jumping around
318:24 - a little bit too much maybe we could
318:26 - come and tweak things a little bit more
318:28 - but for now i'm going to leave it though
318:29 - there is one last thing is everything is
318:32 - really crunched together and smooshed
318:34 - right now and if we come and take a look
318:35 - here we can see we have a lot more
318:37 - spacing coming on our elements and over
318:39 - here too the spacing is a little bit
318:40 - more on everything and this is something
318:42 - that we did earlier but i want to again
318:45 - increase the spacing a little bit more
318:47 - and so if you can think of a way that we
318:48 - can sort of space things out there
318:50 - within here within a class that we
318:51 - already have you can go ahead and add
318:53 - that in
318:55 - that one is just by coming on and adding
318:57 - our flow class here and this is actually
318:59 - going to cause a problem when we do this
319:01 - because now we get a really big space
319:03 - here and here if we look at the design
319:05 - the spacing here is a lot smaller than
319:07 - our spacing there and from a design
319:09 - standpoint that makes sense this
319:10 - information is related to each other so
319:12 - there's a little bit less spacing on it
319:14 - and that does create a little bit of an
319:15 - issue with our flow class here
319:18 - and in a way you could think this could
319:19 - cause a problem and then you could come
319:21 - in and have to add individual margins
319:23 - and everything here
319:24 - another way you could adapt around that
319:26 - is to wrap this content in something and
319:29 - one thing you could do if this was
319:31 - different types of content you could
319:32 - come in here and use a div to do that
319:34 - just so what happens now is the flow
319:36 - class will add spacing around this
319:39 - and this item here so when i hit save we
319:41 - can see that now this is grouped
319:42 - together and then we got our space so
319:44 - that is one solution for short in this
319:47 - case because we are in an article i
319:49 - mentioned this earlier and it's why on
319:51 - my header when i created it we have a
319:53 - class of primary header and i said it's
319:55 - very you know sometimes you can have
319:56 - multiple headers in different places and
319:58 - one place that you can have a header is
320:00 - within an article and you can say that
320:02 - this
320:03 - is the header and close header of my
320:06 - article
320:07 - and this is my heading so that h2 is
320:09 - like the title of my article and this
320:12 - paragraph is effectively now a subtitle
320:14 - and one thing you definitely don't want
320:15 - to do is use another heading level like
320:17 - an h3 as a subtitle a subtitle should be
320:20 - a paragraph and a nice way to sort of
320:21 - distinguish it as a subtitle is actually
320:24 - by wrapping them within a header like
320:25 - this so this is the heading of my
320:27 - article the main title is commander then
320:29 - we get the subtitle of commander is
320:31 - douglas hurley and then we get into the
320:33 - content itself
320:34 - and what we can do on here as well
320:36 - because we do need a little bit of
320:37 - spacing
320:38 - is to come in with a class is equal to
320:40 - flow on here and then you may be going
320:42 - well okay but that
320:44 - once again reintroduces too much space
320:47 - and one way we can solve that is to
320:49 - change the flow spacing that we have on
320:53 - this header right here and i do want to
320:55 - be able to bring this also onto the moon
320:57 - page potentially or you might also need
320:59 - this for the third page so to make it a
321:02 - little bit more generic we could just
321:03 - come in and say flow space small
321:07 - as a reusable utility class so we're
321:09 - saying that we're using our float space
321:11 - and then we're modifying it or you could
321:13 - also do something that's more of like a
321:14 - scope style using a descendant selector
321:16 - or you might say grid container article
321:18 - just because of how it's always being
321:19 - used or you could come in with another
321:21 - way but i want this to be something that
321:22 - can be reused in different places so i
321:25 - will take this approach but again you
321:26 - can follow with multiple different ways
321:28 - to accomplish the same thing so let's
321:30 - come on over to my index
321:32 - go find my utility classes
321:35 - and right here what we could do is we
321:36 - could add that in flow space
321:39 - small and i guess actually
321:41 - this would actually make more sense
321:42 - we're taking that and modifying it that
321:45 - just makes more sense because we're
321:46 - modifying flow so flow space small you
321:48 - can do small space if you prefer and on
321:51 - that one we can just come in and then
321:52 - say that my flow space and change it so
321:55 - we're modifying what this variable is
321:57 - and we could come in with a 0.5 rem
321:59 - instead and we'll just have to then come
322:02 - back over to here just to modify this to
322:04 - fix it there as well and let's hit save
322:06 - and now you can see that that space is a
322:08 - lot smaller than what it used to be so
322:10 - let's just bring this back up to one or
322:12 - remove it i should say maybe and we'll
322:14 - go and take a look and it's a big space
322:16 - and then we can come in and say that it
322:17 - should be a 0.5 rim and we'll hit save
322:21 - and then you have a smaller space that
322:23 - is there to match closer to our design
322:26 - and if you really wanted a more robust
322:28 - system like this you could even have
322:29 - like a split space 1 a flow space 2 a
322:31 - flow space 3 and have different spacing
322:33 - available for each one so then you'd be
322:34 - able to sort of have a whole range of
322:36 - utility classes that you could use to
322:38 - modify things but for now i'm just going
322:40 - to stick with the small and i think i'm
322:42 - actually going to bring it up to 8.75
322:44 - just because i think that matches the
322:46 - design a little bit more and if we go
322:48 - and take a look at the moon page
322:51 - and hit run on that we we do already
322:53 - have a flow class that is giving us some
322:55 - space so that would be all the way up on
322:57 - my main
322:58 - we do have this flow so if i took that
323:00 - off and we hit save everything is sort
323:02 - of you can see there's less spacing here
323:04 - so i'm going to put that flow space back
323:06 - on
323:08 - and i think that's better but i do think
323:10 - we should have a little bit more space
323:12 - in between the text of moon and this
323:14 - right here so i'm also going to come on
323:16 - the same way we did before on my article
323:18 - and just add a flow up here we won't
323:20 - need our small spacing
323:22 - and i do think that is a bit sure to the
323:24 - design itself so i'm going to leave it
323:26 - like that and in the next lesson we're
323:28 - going to see an improvement that we can
323:30 - make with our image that is right here
323:32 - and do something a little bit more with
323:33 - it because we do have web ps that are
323:35 - available to us as well
323:39 - so one of the things that was provided
323:40 - to us from front-end mentor was when we
323:43 - look at our images we have a moon.png
323:45 - and we also have a moon.webp and there's
323:48 - other image formats that are also
323:50 - becoming very popular such as avif and
323:52 - there's probably going to be more and
323:54 - more in the future and one issue with
323:56 - them is browser support and while webp
323:58 - actually has excellent browser support
323:59 - at this stage and avif is getting better
324:03 - when we do have these it is a good idea
324:05 - to provide fallbacks just in case the
324:07 - browser that is trying to load that
324:08 - image can't load the webp and webp is a
324:11 - very interesting format it can replace
324:13 - both jpeg and png because it can support
324:16 - transparency if there's transparency in
324:17 - the image and both cases for png and for
324:20 - jpeg it's just much much better at
324:23 - compression compared to those older
324:25 - formats and so you're getting very crisp
324:27 - good quality images at much smaller file
324:30 - sizes and so just to compare between the
324:32 - moon.png and the web p here
324:35 - the png version is 71 kilobytes whereas
324:38 - the web p1 is 28 and for all of the
324:40 - different images there is quite
324:42 - substantial savings anywhere from 50 and
324:44 - much much higher and to be able to
324:46 - support these we will be using the
324:48 - picture element and it's pretty easy to
324:51 - use the picture element i'm going to
324:52 - come here and write picture
324:54 - and then just come down here and we're
324:56 - going to close picture
324:58 - and there's a little bit more to it but
324:59 - this is the very beginning where you
325:00 - actually do keep your image inside of
325:03 - the picture here you can do a lot more
325:05 - with the picture element than what we're
325:06 - going to be using for it here you can
325:07 - have it bring in different images based
325:09 - on the density of the screen so if you
325:11 - want to bring in a lower res image so
325:13 - it's lighter weight a higher version
325:15 - image for larger ones you can also use
325:16 - it for art direction where you can add a
325:18 - media attribute within here as well so
325:20 - you can do art direction where you're
325:21 - coming in with different images
325:23 - depending on the space that that image
325:24 - has available to it but we're going to
325:26 - keep things really simple just as an
325:27 - introduction to the picture element here
325:29 - where i'm going to write source
325:31 - and source is a lot like the source we
325:33 - have right here so we have a picture
325:35 - then we have our source and in this
325:37 - source what we're going to do is write
325:39 - source set and then we want to get the
325:41 - exact same image so i'm going to take
325:43 - this one and put it right there but we
325:45 - can switch that out for my web p and you
325:47 - do need to give the browser a little bit
325:49 - of context about what the source is and
325:52 - so it can know if it's able to use it or
325:53 - not so i'm going to come in with a type
325:55 - is equal to we're going to say image
325:56 - slash web p and if you're familiar with
325:58 - video this might look very familiar to
326:00 - you
326:01 - uh one of the things that's a bit
326:02 - different is where you can provide it to
326:04 - these here and we don't have an avif but
326:06 - if you say we did have an avid version
326:08 - you could come in here and have the avif
326:10 - and then over here just do it like that
326:12 - and what this is doing is this is
326:14 - setting the png as our default but the
326:16 - browser is going to look through these
326:17 - and it's going to see which one it wants
326:19 - to use does it support webp oh you could
326:21 - use that does it support this nope okay
326:23 - i'm going to use this and the image it's
326:26 - really important you do have an image
326:27 - here because it's actually going to
326:28 - replace this with what we see here so we
326:30 - don't have this version so i'm going to
326:32 - delete that but just to show you how you
326:34 - could provide multiple different
326:35 - versions of the same image and just
326:37 - really fast the reason it is source set
326:39 - is because you could provide multiple
326:41 - different ones here as well and this is
326:43 - where if you had uh different ones with
326:45 - different resolutions so this could be
326:47 - your 1x and then you'd put a comma and
326:49 - do mid path here
326:51 - image dot
326:53 - web
326:54 - p and this could be your one 1.5 x
326:56 - version and then you could also have a
326:57 - 2x version and you just comma separate
327:00 - the different ones that you'd want to be
327:01 - bringing in with a source set uh and
327:04 - that's why it's a source set and not
327:06 - just an src because you can provide a
327:07 - set of different sources here but in
327:09 - this case we only have these two to pick
327:11 - from and if you've never seen the
327:13 - picture element or used it before this
327:14 - could be a nice little note to take down
327:16 - as something you could explore more
327:18 - going forward
327:19 - we will notice that things have broken a
327:21 - little bit because this image is now
327:23 - because it's floating on over here
327:25 - instead of being over here and that's a
327:27 - really simple reason that that's
327:28 - happening and will be a very very easy
327:30 - fix so we can go over to my index
327:33 - dot css and i'm just going to scroll all
327:35 - the way down and the reason that's
327:37 - happening is if you remember when we set
327:38 - things up we did them all with grid
327:40 - container destination image because
327:41 - that's what we had so we can just change
327:43 - that out now for our picture element
327:44 - instead picture and this could actually
327:47 - be a good argument for putting a class
327:48 - because then if it was on a class
327:50 - instead of an element then it could be
327:53 - agnostic of either one but we can just
327:55 - do picture here because we're going to
327:56 - be using a picture in all of them and
327:58 - that just means we do want to come down
328:00 - and change it over the picture anywhere
328:02 - we were using that and there are a few
328:04 - more spots where that was here is
328:06 - another one
328:10 - and i will even though this is commented
328:12 - out just in case in the future we'll
328:14 - switch that one out right there and that
328:16 - means everything should be working fine
328:18 - on this page but we do need to also go
328:21 - and fix that on our crew commander page
328:23 - because if we look now the crew
328:24 - commander has shifted over and
328:26 - everything has broken there because this
328:28 - one is still an image so i'd encourage
328:30 - you to go and just try switching out the
328:32 - image we have here for using the picture
328:34 - element with the webp in the source and
328:36 - then leaving this one just like that and
328:38 - just so you can get a little bit of
328:39 - practice writing it all in and building
328:41 - up some muscle memory there and in just
328:43 - a second i'll go through and do it
328:44 - myself as well
328:47 - all right so we can come in with our
328:49 - picture over here we close our picture
328:53 - and then here we just need to add in our
328:55 - source
328:56 - and we need the source set is equal to
329:00 - and now everything should be good we'll
329:02 - hit save and we've fixed all of our
329:04 - problems and everything is working
329:05 - beautifully right now and with all of
329:08 - that in place i do believe it is time to
329:10 - start adding the functionality or at
329:12 - least uh in the next lesson we won't be
329:14 - adding the functionality itself but
329:16 - we'll be setting the stage so we're able
329:18 - to add the functionality very very soon
329:20 - so if you've been at this for a little
329:22 - while i'd really encourage you to take a
329:23 - nice break right now before we get into
329:25 - this next section just to give yourself
329:27 - time to digest everything you've been
329:28 - learning and then when you're ready to
329:30 - keep on going i'll see you in the next
329:32 - lesson
329:35 - how the fun begins and we want to add
329:37 - some interactivity to our site where
329:39 - when someone clicks on mars it brings
329:41 - them to the mars tab or the europa tab
329:43 - or the titan tab and make it easy to go
329:46 - back and forth between them all so as
329:47 - i've mentioned a few times now one a
329:49 - very simple way would actually to make
329:50 - these links instead of buttons and each
329:52 - one is just its own page which would
329:54 - just involve taking what we've already
329:56 - created on say our moon page and then
329:59 - copy paste everything in place but then
330:01 - just change out the content for the next
330:03 - planet and do the same thing for each
330:04 - one of the planets and that would work
330:07 - very well but we want to make things a
330:09 - little bit more interesting in here so
330:10 - we're going to be using javascript to be
330:12 - able to do it
330:13 - again if you want to just step things up
330:15 - and level up even more than what i'm
330:16 - doing here the data.json file is there
330:19 - and everything could be populated from
330:21 - there instead in this case what i'm
330:23 - going to be doing is the middle ground
330:24 - which will require having duplicate
330:26 - content on the page and cycling through
330:28 - that content so we're gonna have all of
330:30 - that html content only on this page and
330:33 - then when somebody comes and clicks on
330:34 - mars it will just change we'll hide the
330:36 - moon content and we'll bring in that
330:38 - mars content and the same for each one
330:39 - of these other ones so to be able to do
330:42 - that we need to set the stage so we have
330:44 - that content to be able to cycle through
330:46 - so because this destination page for me
330:48 - is going to be acting as my only
330:49 - destination page and not through those
330:51 - other ones i am going to rename this
330:53 - page and we're just going to call it
330:54 - destination instead of destination moon
330:56 - but i will leave those other ones for
330:58 - now because we still need them to get
330:59 - the content that will populate all of
331:01 - our text and everything
331:02 - and one thing we're going to want to do
331:04 - now is to actually create all of this
331:06 - extra content so i'm going to come and
331:10 - take this and we're going to put in four
331:12 - images three four
331:14 - and you can maybe guess what i'm going
331:16 - to do is this first one will get changed
331:18 - to image mars this one here will get
331:21 - changed from image moon over to
331:25 - europa and if i spelled everything right
331:28 - all of the images and actually we
331:29 - shouldn't actually see all of the images
331:31 - we should only see one image if i did
331:32 - everything right here and actually we'll
331:34 - have to hit the run and not save and we
331:36 - should only have one image which should
331:37 - be titan and yeah there we have it we
331:39 - only have titan that is showing up
331:40 - because all of these images are actually
331:42 - there they're just overlapping each
331:44 - other because they're all living in the
331:45 - same place so there's the next one
331:47 - underneath it and now this isn't what we
331:49 - want to do we don't want them all
331:50 - visible at the same time and overlapping
331:52 - each other so there is something we can
331:54 - do to hide them and your first instinct
331:56 - might be to come on and use that class
331:57 - of sr only because that visually hides
331:59 - things we don't want to visually hide
332:01 - them only though because if somebody is
332:03 - using an assistive technology and the
332:04 - screen reader is reading through it it
332:06 - will read all of these and i just
332:08 - realized i didn't change these out
332:09 - either so we do want to make sure all
332:10 - descriptions are good
332:13 - so those are better and if an assistive
332:14 - technology was going through here now we
332:16 - have the proper alts in place we don't
332:18 - want the screen reader to be able to see
332:19 - them and we don't want people to
332:20 - visually be able to see them either so
332:23 - what we can do for that is to actually
332:24 - come on here and use the hidden
332:26 - attribute and the hidden attribute hides
332:28 - it from both screen readers and
332:30 - assistive technologies as well as from
332:32 - visually hiding the content on the page
332:34 - so if i hit save now we can see we only
332:36 - see the moon and if i add the hidden
332:39 - here hidden and then we take this one
332:41 - off and hit save we will only see mars
332:44 - so that is what we're going to use to
332:47 - hide and show the planets we're actually
332:49 - going to be using the same thing for all
332:51 - of our content as well
332:52 - and so if we come down
332:54 - we have our articles that are here and
332:56 - if you have a guess at how i'm going to
332:58 - do this it's very similar to what i did
332:59 - for all the images you can go ahead and
333:01 - set it all up now
333:04 - as i said very similar to what i did
333:06 - from images let's just come down
333:08 - and for this i am going to use some
333:10 - comments because there is a lot of
333:12 - content that is here that is very
333:14 - similar so this last one will be titan
333:17 - this one up here will be
333:20 - europa
333:22 - this one here whoops not the wrong spot
333:25 - this one here will be mars and then this
333:29 - one here is the moon
333:33 - and this just makes our life a lot
333:34 - easier when we're scrolling up and down
333:36 - and looking at our html to know which
333:38 - one we're on
333:39 - and so uh with that i'm gonna quickly go
333:42 - through and actually change all the
333:43 - content just copying and pasting it from
333:45 - these other pages and then we'll talk a
333:48 - little bit more about how this is going
333:49 - to work maybe a while though anyone's
333:52 - able to visit yeah titan considering it
333:54 - would be a seven year trip wow uh
333:56 - they're already worried about the
333:57 - radiation in getting to mars which is
333:59 - just a few months so imagine trying to
334:01 - get over to there anyway uh with all of
334:04 - those in place if i hit save we just
334:05 - have a mess of content because
334:07 - everything is just overlapping each
334:08 - other and it is a complete disaster
334:11 - as you can see there so we want to come
334:13 - onto each one of these in the moon i
334:14 - will leave alone but then on mars we
334:16 - want to add in hidden
334:18 - on the next one we want to come in and
334:20 - add our hidden class or attribute i
334:22 - should say it's an attribute not a class
334:24 - and then hidden here as well hit save
334:27 - and there we go we're back on it just
334:28 - being the moon so now we need to make it
334:30 - so when we click on them things move
334:32 - around and we also want to be doing this
334:33 - in as accessible as a way as possible so
334:36 - in the next lessons we'll be handling
334:38 - javascript we'll also be jumping back
334:40 - into our html to making some changes in
334:42 - here as we go as well just to make sure
334:44 - that everything is as accessible as
334:46 - possible
334:49 - all right so here we are in a nice blank
334:51 - javascript file and you'll notice one
334:53 - thing i have changed just really quickly
334:54 - is i've created this navigation.js this
334:56 - was just the index.js that we'd started
334:58 - with originally
335:00 - just for development purposes i find it
335:02 - much easier to separate the concerns
335:03 - into separate files and then you can use
335:06 - input when you go to production you can
335:08 - have something minify that all into one
335:10 - uh all into one file if needed or for
335:12 - something like this tabs it is on every
335:15 - page except the home page but if you had
335:16 - this only needed on one page it might be
335:19 - fine just to have it as something that
335:21 - you're only including in that one page
335:23 - so let's go and do that now we'll go to
335:24 - my destination and here we can just copy
335:27 - that script and add this in so this will
335:29 - be set as my tabs.js so it's linked and
335:32 - we can make sure it's working when we're
335:34 - actually going to be using it
335:36 - and now what do we want to do well the
335:39 - first thing is we need to be able to
335:40 - access my tabs list itself so let's go
335:42 - and do that so we can say tab
335:44 - we can select my tab list and i will do
335:47 - my document.queryselector
335:49 - and
335:50 - for this there's
335:52 - you could select the class because we
335:53 - have a class that is available to us but
335:55 - to ensure that somebody who is
335:56 - implementing a tab system say there was
335:58 - another page that got added that needed
336:00 - it to ensure that they're taking we
336:02 - spent all that time setting things up
336:05 - to make sure that things were accessible
336:07 - so if you create your tablets this way
336:09 - making sure that the person's actually
336:10 - used the role when creating it it
336:12 - reinforces that accessibility because
336:15 - the whatever they put in place
336:17 - if they haven't used the proper roles on
336:19 - everything it will be one way to ensure
336:21 - that it doesn't actually work
336:22 - so we sort of make sure that the right
336:24 - steps are being taken and we can hear
336:27 - we've found our tab list and our tabs
336:29 - live in there so just to make it a
336:30 - little bit easier for the browser we can
336:32 - look inside our tab list for our uh
336:35 - for the different tabs and for this i
336:36 - will use a query selector all
336:39 - because we have multiple tabs defined
336:41 - and so in there we can then once again
336:43 - reinforce the accessibility a little bit
336:45 - by coming in and saying that the role is
336:47 - equal to tab and now we are ready to
336:50 - start rocking and rolling uh there we
336:52 - will need to get the images as well but
336:53 - we'll come back to that stage a little
336:55 - bit later and for now in this lesson
336:57 - what i want to be focused on is the
336:59 - keyboard navigation to be able to go
337:01 - between the different tabs that we have
337:02 - here
337:03 - so to do that let's just start with our
337:05 - tab list and add an event listener add
337:07 - event listener
337:09 - on there and normally we'd be listening
337:12 - for
337:13 - clicks it's something very often but in
337:14 - this case i want to listen for a key
337:16 - down
337:17 - and that just means if somebody pushes a
337:19 - key we want something to happen so we
337:21 - can come in with a function
337:23 - and once again using an arrow function
337:25 - there and i am going to come and put e
337:27 - here for you know we could write event
337:29 - as well if you wanted to but i'm going
337:30 - to put e what we want to do is when and
337:32 - in this unlike our navigation it's
337:34 - really important that we track where
337:36 - what the event is happening on so when
337:38 - that key down happens we need
337:39 - information from that so let's just do a
337:41 - console log of e
337:44 - and see what that tells us what's what's
337:46 - the browser getting from that
337:47 - so browser list is not defined
337:50 - tab list oh i put tab lists sorry we'll
337:52 - do tab list here as well it should be a
337:54 - singular list and not multiple lists so
337:56 - i'm going to tab on to moon and now what
337:58 - i'm going to do is just push a key on my
338:00 - keyboard and you can see we're getting a
338:02 - keyboard event so what that e is getting
338:06 - is it saying
338:07 - it's giving us the keyboard event saying
338:09 - an event has just happened and it is a
338:11 - keyboard event which makes sense because
338:12 - we're looking for key down and then with
338:14 - the keyboard event you can actually get
338:16 - a key code
338:17 - so let's go check with that keycode is
338:20 - so we'll select moon again and i can
338:21 - start pushing buttons on my keyboard and
338:23 - you see numbers coming up
338:25 - and these numbers correspond to the key
338:28 - that i'm pushing and i can push
338:29 - basically any key on my keyboard and get
338:31 - the key that is associated with it and
338:34 - the only two that we care about right
338:35 - now are my left key which is 37 and my
338:38 - right key which is 39. so
338:40 - let's go and make sure we don't forget
338:42 - those so i'm going to create two new
338:44 - cons we're going to say const
338:46 - d
338:46 - down left down left is going to be equal
338:49 - to 37 and a const t down right is equal
338:54 - to 39 just because it's going to make
338:55 - our life a little bit easier and as we
338:58 - build everything out here
338:59 - and now we can do different things based
339:02 - on those key down numbers so at this
339:04 - stage there's a few different things
339:06 - that need to be done
339:07 - so we know we can now we're looking for
339:10 - a left key down or a right key down and
339:12 - this just leaves a few different things
339:14 - to be done so if we go back over to our
339:16 - destination and look at how things were
339:18 - done first of all we have this tab index
339:20 - of zero that's here and then a tab index
339:22 - of one negative one on this which means
339:24 - it's not selectable so if ever we push
339:26 - it it means that we need to change
339:28 - this to a negative one and make the new
339:30 - one be an actual one and the easiest way
339:33 - to do that is
339:35 - first by uh just coming in on here and
339:38 - just saying
339:39 - uh when we have the key down we want to
339:42 - change the tab index
339:44 - of the current uh tab to negative one so
339:48 - it doesn't matter which key it is that's
339:49 - something that needs to happen and then
339:51 - we want to say if the right key
339:54 - is pushed
339:55 - move move to the next tab on the right
340:00 - or
340:00 - if the left key is pushed move to the
340:05 - next tab on
340:08 - on the left
340:09 - and so if you do have javascript
340:11 - experience and you're feeling
340:12 - comfortable being able to do all of this
340:15 - there's a few little
340:16 - other things that will have have to
340:17 - happen for this to work also in here so
340:19 - i didn't break this down as much as we
340:21 - could but if you're feeling comfortable
340:23 - and you just want to run with it and see
340:24 - if you can get this working then
340:26 - definitely go for it right now if you're
340:28 - learning javascript you're a little bit
340:30 - not sure what the next steps should be
340:32 - still try it out see what you can do but
340:34 - i will be giving you some hints and push
340:35 - you in the right direction at the start
340:37 - of the next lesson or if you're
340:38 - completely new to javascript or it's
340:40 - something you've just started with and
340:41 - you're feeling a little bit lost right
340:42 - now in the next video we'll try and
340:44 - break things down as much as possible
340:48 - let's focus on this one first even
340:50 - though it's gonna give us some some
340:52 - difficulty but let's say if the e key
340:55 - code
340:56 - is equal to our key
340:58 - down
340:59 - left
341:00 - or
341:01 - our e dot key code is equal to
341:05 - our key down right we want to do
341:08 - something and that's because we want to
341:10 - make sure that we remove or we change
341:12 - the current um
341:13 - we want to be able to change the current
341:15 - button to get rid of the tab index
341:17 - that's on there so let's go and see if
341:19 - this is even going to work let's just
341:21 - say we console
341:22 - log test
341:24 - for now and i'm going to hit save on
341:26 - that and so i'm on the moon that's
341:28 - selected i can push to the right or left
341:30 - and either when i'm pushing it's saying
341:31 - test if i push on any other key nothing
341:33 - is happening so
341:36 - if the key is equal my left or right
341:38 - we're console logging our test which we
341:39 - don't want to do obviously we want to do
341:41 - something else so let's console log
341:45 - and i'm actually going to console log
341:46 - tabs for now which is all of our tabs
341:49 - and hit save on there again and now when
341:51 - i select it you can see that it's coming
341:53 - up with a node list because our
341:55 - query selector all creates a node list
341:57 - and actually if we go and look in the
341:59 - actual console and we have one two three
342:02 - four and that would be my one two three
342:04 - four buttons and if you're newer to
342:06 - javascript uh javascript does start
342:08 - counting at zero so the first button in
342:10 - our node list is number zero then number
342:12 - one then number two
342:14 - so if we want to be able to select just
342:16 - the first one which is the currently
342:17 - selected one
342:19 - we want to select zero so we can just
342:21 - put a zero like that right there and now
342:23 - if we test it and we hit tab
342:27 - and we go and select the moon and i push
342:28 - to the right we can see that we're only
342:30 - getting the first one that's coming up i
342:32 - know it's the first one because if i
342:34 - look here we can actually see that area
342:36 - controls is my moon tab so i know i'm
342:38 - getting the first button
342:40 - the only issue is we actually need to be
342:42 - able to cycle through the buttons as
342:43 - things are changing and so right now our
342:46 - tab focus is equal to zero so i can
342:48 - actually come here and switch this out
342:50 - to say tab focus
342:52 - so if i save now it's gonna be the exact
342:55 - same thing left or right it's giving me
342:57 - the same thing we had before because our
342:59 - tab focus here is our zero that's right
343:02 - here so we know that if we
343:04 - select this one we are getting our first
343:06 - button for now and what we want to do on
343:09 - there is similar to what we did on our
343:10 - navigation when we would change an
343:12 - attribute we could use set attribute to
343:14 - do that and i want to set the attribute
343:16 - of my tab index
343:19 - to be negative one because if you
343:20 - remember when we set all of this up what
343:22 - we did was we said moon is zero because
343:24 - we want people to tab onto it and these
343:26 - ones have the negative one but if i push
343:29 - to the right or the left this one
343:30 - shouldn't be focusable anymore so i'm
343:32 - going to change this to negative one in
343:34 - javascript and then we need to change
343:35 - one of these other ones back over to
343:37 - zero so we'll see how we can do that in
343:39 - a second but i'll put zero back on this
343:41 - just so it is still selectable so in
343:43 - doing that we're enabling it so we can
343:45 - remove the attribute when that key down
343:47 - does happen
343:49 - now what's important is we need to
343:52 - change our tab focus to select the next
343:55 - button and we need to make sure that
343:56 - we're selecting the correct one so to
343:58 - make sure that we're doing that let's
343:59 - say we'll start with the right
344:00 - functionality and then we'll do the same
344:02 - thing but the other way around for the
344:04 - the backwards so here we can say that if
344:06 - our e dot key code is equal to our key
344:09 - down right so if we click to move to the
344:12 - right we want something to happen and
344:15 - the first thing i'm going to say is tab
344:16 - focus plus plus and have focus is the
344:19 - same as actuating tab focus is equal to
344:21 - tab focus
344:23 - plus one so we're saying let's add one
344:26 - to here and then
344:28 - save that number back into here so if
344:31 - this is at zero it becomes one if this
344:33 - is at one we do one plus one is two and
344:36 - then tab focus becomes two and so on and
344:38 - so forth and we can just say that that
344:40 - is a plus plus right there so let's do
344:42 - that and let's console log our
344:45 - tab focus to make sure this is actually
344:48 - working so we'll hit save we'll select
344:50 - my moon and push to the right we get one
344:52 - two three four five oh no we got past
344:54 - five because there's no more tabs to
344:56 - actually go through and actually we can
344:58 - test one more thing before i do anything
344:59 - else if i come back to my page now i can
345:01 - actually not select my moon tab anymore
345:04 - because this has been set to negative
345:05 - one now let's save the page so just make
345:08 - sure everything's refreshed we've
345:09 - selected moon i push to the right and i
345:12 - can start cycling through but then if i
345:14 - push tab again and then i do a shift tab
345:16 - to go backwards it jumps up to my
345:17 - navigation because it can't select my
345:20 - moon anymore because this has a negative
345:22 - one on it so i know this is also working
345:24 - at the stage
345:26 - so we know this is working and our tab
345:27 - focus is going up every time we push to
345:29 - the right so that's a good sign there is
345:31 - one thing that we could go too far that
345:33 - we don't want to happen but for now what
345:34 - we'll do is let's just leave that like
345:36 - that uh there is more to do in here but
345:38 - just to make sure we can go up and down
345:40 - why don't you take what we've created
345:42 - here and see if you can get it to
345:43 - subtract when we go the other way so if
345:45 - i push left on the keyboard it subtracts
345:47 - and makes tab focus go down instead of
345:49 - going up
345:52 - all right so i'll grab that paste it in
345:54 - there and we just want to make sure this
345:55 - is my key down left not my key down
345:58 - right and we have a plus plus we can do
346:00 - a minus minus instead
346:02 - so now we go on my moon push to the
346:04 - right one two three push to the left to
346:08 - one so now by pushing that the keys on
346:11 - here we can cycle through those
346:12 - different numbers and that is super
346:15 - super good and we're actually getting
346:16 - pretty close to being done so let's just
346:19 - take these comments out because i think
346:20 - they you know this is saying what we're
346:22 - doing so with that in place now what we
346:24 - want to do is when we tab into and have
346:27 - moon selected if i push to the right or
346:29 - left i actually want it to switch to i
346:31 - want the focus to switch to that tab i
346:33 - don't want it to change the content
346:35 - that's here yet i want it to be if they
346:37 - they can shift the focus over to the
346:39 - next one and then if they choose that
346:41 - tab then it will change the content
346:43 - that's inside of it and to choose the
346:45 - tab once it's selected you can just push
346:46 - space on the keyboard and it will select
346:48 - that button so when someone pushes left
346:51 - or right i want the focus to move to
346:53 - that next tab and to be able to do that
346:55 - there's two important things one of them
346:57 - is we want the focus to actually move to
346:58 - that tab and we also want to change the
347:00 - tab index on that one as well to set it
347:02 - to zero so if you feel like you have a
347:04 - little idea in your head about how we
347:06 - could accomplish that go ahead and do
347:08 - that now if you'd like a little hint i'm
347:10 - going to give one in the next lesson and
347:12 - if you just want to follow along a
347:13 - little bit with me as well we'll be
347:14 - continuing off here in the next lesson
347:16 - and i'll leave this for you as we have
347:18 - it at the moment
347:21 - all right so if you tried that out i
347:23 - hope that it went well and you were able
347:24 - to get it to work and if you ran into
347:26 - any issues let's see if we can help you
347:27 - with them right now
347:28 - so what we're going to do is choose my
347:30 - tabs with my tab focus here and on here
347:33 - what we do is then say set attribute and
347:36 - it's kind of the opposite of what we did
347:38 - when we went here where we set it to
347:39 - negative one we actually want to set
347:41 - this one to
347:43 - zero which makes it so we can actually
347:45 - select it and three with zero there and
347:47 - what this means is that next tab
347:49 - actually becomes something that can be
347:51 - focused on
347:52 - what it doesn't do is focus that tab
347:54 - immediately and we want to make sure
347:56 - that the focus switches at the same time
347:58 - so to be able to do that we can come in
348:00 - and say tab tab focus
348:02 - and then we can say that we want to set
348:05 - the focus on here and do it just like
348:07 - that we could string these together but
348:09 - doing it like this is nice and clear so
348:11 - i'm going to leave it like this and to
348:13 - test and just double make sure that it's
348:15 - working i'm going to go to my css file
348:17 - and let's just come down and say
348:19 - role is equal to
348:21 - tab
348:23 - focus
348:24 - and we'll say the color is lime green
348:27 - and with that in place make sure this is
348:29 - saved and let's go and take a look if
348:30 - it's working so i should be able to tab
348:32 - onto moon and then push to the right and
348:34 - look at that we've changed and change
348:36 - and we can go back and forth between
348:37 - them now but we do run into a problem
348:40 - and that problem is if i go to the right
348:42 - and then what happens if i push right
348:44 - again now
348:45 - we get an error
348:47 - because there's nothing to set the
348:48 - attribute on it's trying to go to a
348:49 - fifth element here and there is no fifth
348:51 - element and now i've completely broken
348:53 - it and the same problem could happen i'm
348:54 - going to refresh my page get onto my
348:56 - moon we can go that way but then if i go
348:58 - back to my moon and i push to the left
349:00 - we get an error there because there's
349:02 - nothing to go to and that breaks
349:04 - everything
349:05 - so if you know how to fix this you can
349:07 - go ahead and come up with a solution to
349:09 - it now and if not i'll be showing a
349:11 - solution in just a few seconds
349:15 - so what we want to do is if somebody
349:17 - pushes the right and they get all the
349:18 - way to titan and then they push right
349:20 - again there's two options one of them is
349:21 - we just don't let it happen or we cycle
349:24 - back and bring it back to moon and
349:25 - that's what i'm going to do but if you
349:26 - chose one where it just stopped going
349:28 - and then you got to hear and it stopped
349:29 - going that way i think that'd be okay
349:31 - but i just like being able to cycle
349:32 - through things and i just think that's a
349:34 - little bit easier if somebody is using
349:36 - keyboard navigation to move between
349:38 - these
349:38 - um and if it's especially if it's a
349:40 - screen reader and you push to the right
349:41 - and it just does nothing you might be a
349:43 - little bit confused and not know why
349:45 - nothing's happening
349:47 - and again then you'd probably figure it
349:48 - out but let's lower the friction as much
349:50 - as possible here
349:52 - so on the tab focus we want to do a plus
349:54 - plus but we don't want it to go any
349:56 - higher than what it's doing so if we get
349:58 - to the end we want to go back to the
350:00 - start so if tab focus
350:04 - is um we want to say if it's greater
350:06 - than or equal to
350:08 - tabs.length let's let's find out what
350:10 - tabs.length even is
350:12 - before before i say that so we can say
350:14 - tabs
350:15 - so let's say console log tabs.length
350:19 - now anytime i push to the right we see
350:21 - four come up so it's basically just
350:22 - counting how many items we have in this
350:25 - list even though we're starting counting
350:26 - at zero it knows you know it's zero one
350:28 - two three it counts for all four items
350:31 - that are in there so
350:33 - if let's so let's bring back that if
350:34 - statement that i just had is so if tab
350:37 - focus is greater than or equal to tab's
350:40 - length so if it becomes four or bigger
350:42 - we want to do something and as i said i
350:45 - want to cycle it back to moon over here
350:47 - so either if you weren't sure how to do
350:49 - this at all or if you created something
350:51 - that worked but it stopped when it got
350:52 - to titan and you want to try and get it
350:54 - to go back there why don't you see if
350:55 - you can figure out what the solution to
350:57 - this would be to get it to go back to
350:58 - the beginning
351:01 - all right so for that one it's not too
351:03 - tricky we just have to say tab focus is
351:05 - now equal to zero if tab focus happens
351:07 - to get to a number that's too big it
351:09 - just goes back to zero and so let's try
351:11 - that out and i should be able to go to
351:13 - my moon go that way go that way and now
351:15 - fingers crossed
351:16 - it goes back to moon and i can just keep
351:18 - cycling around that way but if i go the
351:20 - other way it breaks again so we need to
351:23 - bring that same type of functionality
351:25 - down to this one so if you've been
351:26 - following up until now because you
351:28 - weren't too sure why don't you go to see
351:29 - if you can reverse this to get it to go
351:31 - the other way around right here
351:35 - all right so i hope you were able to do
351:37 - that and you might have had to think
351:38 - about it a little bit if you especially
351:40 - if you're not used to javascript so i'm
351:41 - going to say the same thing before tab
351:43 - focus but in this case we don't have to
351:45 - be equal to anything we just want to say
351:46 - that if it's less than
351:48 - zero and this is where if you're newer
351:50 - to javascript maybe you got tripped up a
351:51 - little bit
351:53 - when we're going bigger we want to stop
351:55 - when we get to the end of our list but
351:56 - when we're going the other way our first
351:58 - item is zero so if we go lower than zero
352:01 - we want to change our tab focus
352:03 - and so what you might have done or what
352:05 - sometimes
352:06 - people will do in something like this is
352:08 - they'll say tab focus is equal to four
352:10 - i don't want to do that because if i say
352:13 - uh three even it shouldn't be four
352:15 - because we're starting count at zero so
352:17 - zero one two three would be titan uh the
352:20 - issue with that and this is the same
352:22 - reason i use tabs length here instead of
352:24 - just putting in a hard-coded number is
352:26 - because what happens if they end up
352:28 - adding another destination or if we're
352:30 - reusing this on one of the other pages
352:33 - later on we obviously don't want this to
352:36 - cause any issues along the way so that's
352:38 - where we can come here and say tabs
352:40 - dot length
352:41 - this once again will cause a little bit
352:44 - of an issue because if we do that um
352:45 - let's just go look and see what happens
352:47 - where whoops i forgot this so let's go
352:50 - and fix that and go take a look and now
352:53 - if i go there and i go from here and i
352:55 - go to the left it gives me an error
352:57 - because it's trying to find something
352:59 - that doesn't exist yet because tab
353:01 - length is 4 but we have zero one two
353:04 - three right here so if ever you do
353:06 - something like this this does need to be
353:08 - a negative one right there
353:10 - so it's the full length because we have
353:11 - four items but because we start counting
353:13 - at zero we have to subtract one from the
353:15 - counting we were doing so a little bit
353:17 - tricky not so straightforward so if you
353:19 - did get stuck if you were newer to all
353:20 - of this no problem at all now let's go
353:22 - test it out now so we can go this way we
353:24 - knew that was working and now we can go
353:26 - that way as well and we can cycle
353:28 - through in both directions
353:30 - so i'm super happy with that and one
353:32 - thing that we can actually do here just
353:33 - to clean things up a little bit instead
353:35 - of having all of this here is to grab
353:37 - this and take all of it out
353:39 - just like this
353:41 - and i'm going to come over here instead
353:43 - and we're going to say that we're going
353:44 - to have a function
353:45 - called change
353:47 - tab focus
353:49 - and the advantage of doing this is it's
353:52 - just going to help us sort of clean
353:54 - things up and make it a little bit more
353:55 - clear what's actually happening so we
353:57 - can change tab focus and we're saving
353:59 - all of those things that we did and i'll
354:02 - just grab this tab focus and sort of
354:03 - keep it with that function
354:05 - just because they're related this does
354:06 - need to be kept in um this does need to
354:09 - be kept outside this function or just
354:11 - the numbering is going to go off and
354:13 - then what we can do to simplify this
354:15 - even is when we have the key down we
354:18 - want to do something and we want to
354:19 - change the focus uh the tab focus right
354:22 - there so we can actually delete most of
354:24 - this just like that and just say change
354:27 - tab focus just like this so when
354:30 - somebody so we're listening for a key
354:32 - down and when a key down happens we're
354:34 - going to change the tab focus then we
354:37 - want to know what is that we can look
354:38 - down here and find that function and see
354:40 - everything that it's doing right there
354:42 - so let's hit save and just double check
354:44 - that it's still working there we go we
354:45 - can see that we can still cycle through
354:47 - our tabs and everything there is working
354:49 - perfectly fine
354:50 - so this just makes it a little bit
354:52 - easier because we're gonna have another
354:53 - function that's going to activate this
354:56 - so we're going to be able to select the
354:57 - tab and then activate the tab so we're
354:59 - just sort of making it a little bit
355:00 - easier to read so we know what's
355:02 - happening and then if we need to make
355:04 - changes to our tab focus we can do that
355:06 - and if you're comfortable or feeling up
355:08 - for a bit of a challenge in activating
355:10 - the content itself when a tab is clicked
355:12 - on then why don't you go ahead and add
355:14 - that functionality now and if you want
355:16 - to see how i get started with it i'll be
355:18 - doing that at the start of the next
355:20 - lesson
355:23 - all right so i hope that went well for
355:24 - you if you took the challenge on and if
355:26 - you weren't too sure about where to get
355:27 - started with it we're going to do that
355:29 - now and we're going to do something very
355:30 - similar to what we did here but this one
355:32 - will have to be a little bit different
355:34 - because i need to be going onto each
355:36 - individual tab instead of looking at the
355:38 - entire tab list all at once and to do
355:41 - that i'm going to say tabs got
355:43 - four each so we can cycle through and
355:45 - loop through the different tabs that we
355:46 - have
355:47 - and then with this for each that means
355:49 - we can do something with each one of the
355:51 - individual tabs so we're pretty much
355:53 - saying for each thing that's in here we
355:55 - want to run a function
355:56 - i'm putting the word tab here you can
355:58 - call this literally anything you want it
355:59 - to be it's just we have tabs so tabs for
356:03 - each tab that is inside of there we want
356:05 - to do something so i think that you know
356:06 - that's a very common uh naming
356:08 - convention to have your plural here and
356:10 - then the singular one here
356:12 - and then for each one of these we can
356:13 - add our event listener so then we can
356:16 - say tab dot add event listener and in
356:19 - this case we don't want a key down we
356:20 - want to look listen for a click
356:23 - and then if somebody clicks we want to
356:24 - do something and
356:26 - let's just say for now we'll come in
356:28 - with a really quick function to see
356:30 - what even this is doing and i'm just
356:32 - going to say console.log
356:34 - tab itself just so we can see what we're
356:36 - getting so if i come on to moon and i
356:37 - click on it
356:38 - you can see the area controls moon or my
356:41 - mars
356:42 - or my euro bus so when i'm clicking on
356:44 - them it's working interestingly enough
356:47 - if i use my mouse to navigate through
356:49 - here and then i push spacebar it's also
356:52 - going to act as a click so it means that
356:54 - it's also very easy to keyboard and
356:56 - navigate through here which is very good
356:58 - and so there we go that's how this is
357:00 - working and how we can get an event
357:01 - listener on each tab and it knows what
357:03 - we're doing on each of them but we're
357:05 - going to take a similar approach than we
357:07 - did here so for each one of those we can
357:09 - delete all of this
357:11 - and delete that and we can say here that
357:13 - we just want to say change tab panel and
357:16 - that's what our function will be called
357:17 - so before we were changing the tab focus
357:20 - and cycling through our tabs now we're
357:21 - going to be looking at the indiv the
357:23 - entire tab panel that we have there as
357:25 - well and so that's all we're going to be
357:27 - doing and i just need to close that so
357:29 - we're closing everything off and now we
357:32 - actually have to create this tab panel
357:34 - function so let's go all the way down to
357:35 - here and then we can say function
357:38 - we can then come in and create something
357:40 - so there's a few different things we're
357:41 - going to have to do this time and if you
357:44 - weren't too sure where to get started
357:45 - and this sort of pushed you in the right
357:46 - direction you can take off from right
357:48 - here and obviously if you'd like a
357:50 - little bit of help i'm going to keep on
357:52 - going so what we're going to do is a
357:54 - const target button it's equal to e dot
357:58 - target and target and let's see what
358:01 - that even is so console log
358:03 - of my target button
358:06 - and let's go take a look
358:08 - whoops i'm missing a
358:10 - and here i'm just missing uh closing
358:12 - parentheses sorry about that and so now
358:14 - if we go and take a look uh if i click
358:17 - on one of them we are getting our target
358:19 - buttons this is the same console log i
358:21 - was doing before so we're getting the
358:24 - button that we've clicked on or the tab
358:25 - i guess this could actually be target
358:27 - tab would make more sense
358:29 - so there we go we're selecting the
358:31 - our target tab the tab that we've
358:33 - clicked on then the next thing we want
358:34 - to do is get our const target panel
358:38 - target tab and on here what i'm going to
358:40 - do is i get attribute and this is a
358:44 - and if you can think of if you want to
358:45 - go look in the destination and how we
358:47 - set everything up what attribute do we
358:50 - have that is on there that we'd be able
358:52 - to use and find out what panel we want
358:54 - to be getting so remember the target tab
358:56 - we're going to see the button and we
358:57 - have an attribute on the button that is
358:59 - linking it to a panel so i really
359:01 - encourage you if you haven't already
359:02 - built this out on your own to go and
359:03 - dive into that and see if you can find
359:05 - out which attribute that would be
359:08 - so i hope you found it maybe even got
359:10 - that in there and got a little bit more
359:12 - working so let's go look at our
359:13 - destination page and this is here when
359:16 - we have a button we have our area
359:18 - controls the moon tab and that is going
359:21 - to bring us to here and i just realized
359:23 - we actually forgot the role that we
359:25 - needed on these so i'm going to bring
359:26 - those over in a little bit but right now
359:28 - we don't need them yet
359:29 - um so we have our area controls of our
359:31 - moon tab so this is the one that we need
359:34 - at the moment so let's go back to our
359:36 - tabs.js and that means here we can get
359:39 - our area
359:41 - controls let's go and do a console log
359:44 - again console log
359:46 - target
359:48 - panel just like that let's go see if
359:49 - this works if i click on moon moon tab
359:52 - if i click on mars mars tab so we're
359:54 - getting the attribute and it's telling
359:56 - us the name
359:57 - of the panel that we wanted to activate
359:59 - so that is perfect i'll leave the
360:01 - console log there because we're going to
360:02 - keep on console logging stuff as we're
360:04 - going through so now we want to show
360:06 - that selected panel we know which one we
360:09 - want we want to be able to show it and
360:11 - this is where things are actually a
360:12 - little bit tricky because when we're
360:14 - looking at our tabs here and what we're
360:16 - cycling through in this this target
360:17 - panel is really just like a a string
360:20 - we're not actually finding the the piece
360:22 - in there that we need to show and so if
360:24 - we go back to our destination page we
360:25 - look at how this tabs are set up right
360:27 - now we're inside of this div so we're
360:30 - living here right now and we don't
360:32 - actually really want to be living here
360:34 - right now we don't even want to be in
360:36 - the parent we're sort of on this
360:38 - individual button thing here if we
360:40 - jumped up to the parent we'd be over
360:41 - here and what we need to do is move from
360:44 - here to like this bigger to this entire
360:48 - main really and we need to look at
360:49 - everything that's in here on the main
360:52 - so we can do that not too difficultly
360:54 - but it is a little bit strange and if
360:55 - you got this might be something that
360:57 - sort of caught you off guard and you're
360:58 - unsure of how we can find the right
361:00 - article and so we need to do is take a
361:02 - step back
361:03 - to here to do a few things that we're
361:05 - going to do a little bit later on and
361:07 - then we need to do that further step
361:08 - back to be able to get into like the
361:10 - entire parent to be able to do some
361:12 - different manipulations on there
361:14 - so i'm actually going to create another
361:16 - const here so this is going to be
361:18 - const tab container and we want to say
361:21 - target tab
361:23 - and then from here we can say the parent
361:25 - node and that just means select the
361:27 - parent so let's take my tab container
361:29 - and console log that to make sure it's
361:30 - working so if i click on any of these it
361:32 - should show us my entire tab list so tab
361:35 - list tab list tab list it's showing up
361:38 - for each and every one of them so we've
361:40 - select every time we click on that it is
361:42 - identifying which one the parent is but
361:45 - as i said we also need to be able to
361:46 - take a step up from there so we can do
361:49 - one more step here of saying const main
361:51 - container
361:52 - and equal tab container dot parent node
361:56 - parent
361:57 - node and you you might be saying this is
361:59 - a weird way to be like stepping
362:01 - backwards but it's safer to do it this
362:03 - way to then to be doing a specific query
362:05 - selector to try and find the parent
362:08 - because you could be saying well kevin
362:09 - it's always in the
362:10 - you know my parent in this case is my
362:13 - main but you might drop it into a
362:15 - situation where you don't want to be
362:16 - looking in the main you have a different
362:18 - setup maybe it's in an aside all of a
362:20 - sudden and then the main doesn't help or
362:22 - it's in a footer for some reason
362:24 - or it's you know nested in a completely
362:26 - different way where it's three levels
362:27 - deeper so the important thing is you
362:30 - just want to have a div here that's your
362:31 - tab list and then a list of articles all
362:33 - the articles individually placed outside
362:36 - and then
362:37 - as long as these guys are all siblings
362:39 - with each other this is always going to
362:40 - work no matter what situation you're
362:42 - being put into and wherever your plug-in
362:44 - playing thing so it just makes it a
362:45 - little bit more robust even though it
362:47 - might seem a little contrived to like
362:48 - step back a little bit
362:50 - so now if we come in when we click we
362:52 - should always get our main in this case
362:54 - but again if you plugged and played this
362:56 - you could use it in different places and
362:58 - it would still work perfectly fine so
363:00 - now that we know which one the main
363:01 - container is we can go in in my main
363:04 - container and do a query selector we
363:07 - want my my query selector to be anything
363:10 - that has the attribute the the query
363:12 - that has this attribute on it
363:14 - now to be able to do that we so we want
363:17 - an attribute selector so we can come in
363:19 - with our query selector with our
363:20 - attribute selector and what we want to
363:23 - do is actually use something called a
363:24 - template literal where we're going to
363:26 - use a set of backticks and inside the
363:28 - backpicks we can then call we're going
363:30 - to do this guy right here our pound
363:32 - symbol and then use this guy right here
363:35 - so we can go in and get our target panel
363:38 - and so we can say target panel
363:41 - and when we do that we want to do
363:43 - something on this target panel which is
363:45 - to remove
363:47 - remove the attribute
363:51 - of which attribute you want to remove
363:53 - the hidden one because that is why we
363:55 - can't see it on the screen
363:57 - so if we do that let's see i'm going to
363:59 - comment this out because we don't need
364:00 - that and let's try this out and see what
364:02 - happens so i'm going to
364:05 - get on to let's go and select europa and
364:08 - push spacebar
364:10 - and it shows up but we have a problem
364:13 - which is our old content is still there
364:15 - so if you want to try and solve that
364:17 - problem right now and i'll be looking at
364:18 - the solution to that in the next lesson
364:24 - so obviously that's a little bit of a
364:25 - disaster where we can hide and overlap
364:28 - content like that because it just
364:30 - doesn't look nice and we can just we can
364:31 - keep on going and get all of them there
364:32 - and we don't want that to happen so
364:34 - before this happens we want to be able
364:36 - to hide the current panel that we're
364:38 - already on and one thing that we're not
364:40 - looking at right now is what the current
364:42 - tab actually is so one way you could
364:44 - solve this is find what the current one
364:45 - is and then add the attribute of hidden
364:48 - on there and another way that simplifies
364:50 - things a little bit is it doesn't really
364:52 - matter which one we're on we can just
364:54 - hide everything and then activate this
364:56 - afterward where we're removing the
364:58 - hidden from the one that we need to see
365:00 - so that just means we can do a little
365:02 - bit less work
365:03 - so to do that we can just say that our
365:05 - main container and on the main container
365:07 - we can then do a query selector and i
365:10 - want to actually we need to find all of
365:12 - them and currently they're articles so i
365:13 - will just come in here and write find
365:16 - every article that is in there
365:18 - and as you've seen before and let's put
365:20 - a bit of space here
365:21 - you've seen before that when we do have
365:23 - a query selector all we can then do and
365:25 - we've just used this recently we can
365:28 - loop through all of them
365:30 - and so let's do that let's say our query
365:32 - selector all every article we can loop
365:34 - through them all so we can run a for
365:36 - each and so for each and we can say
365:39 - rtcol what do we want to do we want to
365:42 - for each article we can then say set
365:46 - at tribute and we can just set a hidden
365:50 - is equal to true
365:52 - on all of them now this is making one
365:54 - really long line so one way that this
365:56 - can actually be made a little bit
365:57 - simpler is you could um break this up
366:00 - over multiple lines so we could actually
366:01 - say
366:02 - main container query selector and then
366:04 - just put a space there and it knows what
366:07 - to do with that
366:08 - um and then even here we could break
366:11 - things up onto multiple lines here if we
366:13 - wanted to as well um i'm gonna leave it
366:15 - just like this though and we're gonna
366:16 - hit save and if we click here you can
366:19 - see now it's actually working now we
366:20 - have a little jumping content that's
366:22 - happening there which is kind of
366:23 - interesting and it's happening because
366:25 - the text here is
366:27 - shorter here and longer here and it's
366:29 - actually causing even the image to move
366:31 - which i'm surprised the image is moving
366:34 - so we'll take a look at that in um once
366:36 - we sort of clean things up because we
366:38 - might have to play with the things a
366:39 - little bit more but also just to check
366:41 - things should still be working at this
366:43 - one as well where we can see our content
366:45 - is
366:45 - um behaving properly and there we go so
366:48 - we can see things are working nicely and
366:50 - we're able to go between the different
366:52 - pieces of content
366:53 - and so again we're saying here that
366:55 - everything is becoming hidden and then
366:57 - we're turning on the one that we wanted
366:58 - instead of having to try and find which
367:00 - one we were doing
367:02 - now the problem with this is this is an
367:04 - article and just like before i was
367:06 - saying that we want this to be able to
367:07 - be used anywhere and if maybe you're
367:10 - doing a tab system that isn't using
367:12 - articles that should be fine we
367:13 - shouldn't be forced to be using articles
367:15 - necessarily because you could be tabbing
367:16 - through other pieces of information that
367:18 - maybe aren't you know and articles not
367:20 - the right co the right semantic code to
367:22 - be using here what i'm going to do is
367:24 - we're going to jump back over into my
367:25 - destination
367:26 - and on each one of the articles i am
367:28 - going to add a role so we can come over
367:30 - here and i'm going write role is equal
367:32 - to
367:32 - tab panel and this and for the rules you
367:36 - can't invent your own and i might have
367:38 - maybe should have mentioned this earlier
367:40 - but since we're here roles are very
367:42 - specific things that come from area so
367:43 - i'm not inventing these these are
367:45 - existing things that i'm using and it
367:47 - adds as i said it adds context to things
367:50 - like divs and so
367:52 - before in the old days this would be a
367:53 - lot more useful now we have our nav our
367:55 - header our main so we don't need to use
367:58 - roles as much as we used to but there
368:00 - are certain things where we do and again
368:01 - they're very they're predefined these
368:03 - aren't things that i'm creating on my
368:04 - own and for each one of these we can
368:06 - come in and add a role of tab panel
368:10 - and last but not least we have this one
368:12 - right there on titan so i've saved that
368:14 - and let's go back to my tabs here and it
368:16 - just means instead of selecting my
368:18 - article for each one we can come in and
368:21 - change this to save for each and then in
368:23 - here we can say the role is equal to and
368:26 - put my tab panel
368:28 - and just make sure that if you have
368:30 - single quotes use double quotes or vice
368:32 - versa and this should be lowercase there
368:35 - we go
368:36 - and then here i can change this to say
368:38 - panel and panel so it's a little bit
368:41 - more consistent so for each tab panel so
368:44 - we get all of my tab panels for and then
368:46 - for each uh panel we go through and set
368:50 - that panel's attribute to hidden so
368:52 - same functionality let's just go and see
368:54 - make sure that i didn't break anything
368:56 - and it looks like it is still working so
368:58 - i'm happy with that we can go through
368:59 - and also do it with our keyboard
369:01 - navigation and i'm happy with that
369:03 - except it seems to have broken something
369:05 - right there with my moon title and so
369:08 - let's go over there and see i probably
369:09 - just took off one too many um
369:12 - closing brackets
369:14 - and that's exactly what it was we just
369:16 - have to make sure that we close that
369:17 - right there and we fixed it good okay
369:20 - uh and now we can cycle through and
369:22 - select the one we want and there we go
369:24 - it's working just like it should uh of
369:26 - course no we have another problem which
369:28 - is our image isn't changing so why don't
369:30 - we look at how we can do that in the
369:32 - next lesson and as usual if you want to
369:34 - take your own stab at it first you can
369:36 - go for it and then i'll be taking a look
369:38 - at it over there in the next lesson
369:44 - and if you did get stuck at all you
369:45 - should be able to take a lot of what
369:47 - we've already done here but to make it
369:49 - work for our images
369:50 - and as i actually said in a previous
369:52 - lesson when we were setting everything
369:53 - up ideally the images would be part of
369:56 - our tab system but because of the way
369:57 - the layout was working um i couldn't
370:00 - actually fit it into like the tab panel
370:02 - and
370:02 - just with the the way the layout broke
370:04 - especially on the destination page but
370:06 - with the tabs like with the image let's
370:08 - get to this screen size with the image
370:10 - being up here then the tabs and that
370:12 - down there
370:13 - i couldn't find a good solution to
370:14 - include the image within the article
370:16 - here so that's why we are separating
370:18 - them out but we should be able to change
370:20 - them so the first thing we'll do is we
370:22 - saw that we need to hide things so as i
370:24 - said we can do things very similar to
370:27 - what we did here to hide the image so
370:28 - why don't we copy that and then just
370:30 - break things down and see how we can use
370:31 - that to also hide the image
370:34 - so my main container query selector all
370:37 - but this time we want to select all of
370:40 - my images or in this case it is the
370:41 - picture element and i was saying before
370:44 - how i didn't like using article up
370:46 - higher for that like it doesn't i like
370:48 - that it could work in an environment
370:50 - where maybe the the article isn't an
370:52 - article it's just a div or it's
370:54 - something or it could be something else
370:56 - and i think that could actually make
370:57 - sense depending on different contexts
371:00 - here if we have an image ideally it
371:01 - would always be a picture element uh if
371:04 - you wanted to make this a little bit
371:05 - more robust you could make it and look
371:07 - for either a picture or an image and
371:10 - only use whatever it comes across we
371:12 - don't run it into any problems but i
371:13 - feel pretty safe saying we're doing a
371:15 - query selector all for the pictures
371:18 - and then we could say for each image and
371:20 - remember this here and i could say like
371:22 - for each pick
371:23 - if we wanted just so it's sort of
371:25 - keeping the same um the same thing or
371:27 - even picture
371:28 - so we're doing we're looking for all the
371:30 - pictures and then for each picture
371:32 - we can then set the attribute of hidden
371:35 - to true and of course if this becomes
371:37 - picture this one will also have to
371:39 - become a picture and let's hit save and
371:40 - go and check that out and ideally that
371:42 - would just mean the image would vanish
371:44 - and it does look at that there we go
371:46 - perfect
371:47 - and then the next thing we need to do is
371:49 - get the new image to come in and now we
371:52 - actually need to do something very
371:54 - similar to how we did this to be able to
371:56 - get the image to work but there is a bit
371:59 - more work than has to be done than is
372:00 - super obvious right now so if you want
372:02 - to give it a try you might run into a
372:04 - few issues along the way that could trip
372:06 - you up a little bit but if you want to
372:07 - give it a try i'd really encourage you
372:09 - to do it but it's not as simple as
372:11 - taking this and switching this out so
372:13 - that's the first thing i'm going to say
372:15 - if you'd like another hint i'm going to
372:17 - give one in a few seconds and then after
372:19 - that hint i'll wait another few seconds
372:20 - before i give the actual solution
372:24 - all right so for this you will need to
372:26 - use as i said something very similar
372:27 - here
372:28 - but
372:29 - the target panel here we could change
372:30 - this to say target image
372:32 - first off though my target panel is
372:34 - something that we've already defined up
372:36 - here so
372:37 - that means we need to define what our
372:39 - target image actually is and to be able
372:41 - to find the image that we want to target
372:43 - we will have to make a few little
372:44 - additions and changes in our html and
372:48 - i'm just going to leave it there that's
372:49 - the one thing i'm going to say just to
372:51 - make sort of a link the same way that we
372:53 - linked our panels to our tabs to our
372:56 - panels we're going to create a different
372:58 - type of link from our tabs to our images
373:00 - i'll leave that hint there for you try
373:02 - it out and again if you get stuck don't
373:04 - feel bad i'll wait a few seconds now to
373:05 - let you take on this challenge and then
373:07 - i'll go through and show you my solution
373:12 - all right so as i said we need to come
373:13 - up here and let's say const target image
373:16 - is going to be equal to
373:18 - and how do we find out so let's let's
373:20 - just keep on going target tab dot
373:23 - get attributes
373:25 - and if you remember area controls goes
373:27 - to an id so we can't use the area
373:29 - control so we do have to use something
373:31 - else here
373:32 - and so let's before we do that let's
373:34 - come back to my destination and just
373:35 - take a look here so here we have my area
373:36 - controls moon tab and then if we look
373:38 - down here that's linking to my id and
373:40 - well an id is a good way to hook into
373:42 - something because you know there's only
373:44 - one of them so we could come up and add
373:46 - the ids to these pictures up here i'm i
373:49 - think that actually makes a lot of sense
373:50 - so i'm going to come into each one of
373:52 - these and i'll add an id to them and
373:53 - i'll see you in just one a second
373:55 - all right so there we go i have a moon
373:57 - image by mars image my europa image and
373:59 - my id of titan image on that picture and
374:02 - now how can we hook into those what can
374:03 - we do and one way that we can do that is
374:06 - on their buttons that we have here we
374:08 - get to add more attributes to here and
374:11 - i'm going to come in with data image and
374:13 - remember data attributes are ones that
374:16 - are your own attribute unlike an area or
374:18 - on like our roles
374:20 - and other things like that this is
374:22 - something you can define and you can do
374:23 - anything you want with it so my moon
374:26 - would just be my moon image and so on
374:28 - and so forth so i'm going to just
374:30 - quickly place this on all of them and
374:31 - then we'll go back into getting
374:33 - everything working
374:34 - all right so all of those data
374:36 - attributes are in place and let's go
374:38 - over to my tabs now and if you can think
374:40 - of how to finish this off if you haven't
374:42 - already done it go ahead and do that and
374:45 - then i'll take over and do it myself
374:48 - so here we can say our get attribute of
374:51 - data image and that means that if we hit
374:53 - save now that should be it
374:55 - look at that our image is also changing
374:57 - so cool and so fun so just like that
375:00 - we've created most of the functionality
375:02 - that we need but there's one more thing
375:04 - that we need to do with all of this
375:06 - which i'll be addressing in the next
375:07 - lesson plus i think we can clean this up
375:09 - a little bit as well
375:15 - and so if we go over back to my
375:16 - destination page and we look at my
375:19 - buttons
375:20 - one thing that you need to remember is
375:21 - we had our area selected here and we're
375:23 - saying this one is currently selected
375:25 - and again this is for assistive
375:26 - technologies to know which tab is
375:28 - currently the active tab and if you
375:30 - remember when we styled things up like
375:31 - we go to my page now and i click on
375:33 - these it's not actually switching which
375:35 - one is the active tab and that's because
375:37 - we used our area selected to help us
375:40 - with that and so we can take that and
375:43 - take advantage of that by actually
375:45 - moving that around so that is how we're
375:47 - going to get this to move from one to
375:49 - the next instead of needing a css class
375:51 - or something like we did on our
375:52 - navigation which we still haven't
375:54 - actually changed but we'll do that when
375:56 - we sort of clean up all the loose ends
375:58 - at the very end
375:59 - and so with this
376:01 - we need to switch it to the active tab
376:03 - so to be able to do this we need to do
376:05 - two things we want to first make sure
376:06 - that the current tab isn't area selected
376:08 - we need to switch that to false and then
376:10 - the new tab that we've selected we want
376:12 - to switch it to true and for this it's
376:14 - actually a little bit simpler because in
376:16 - these we had to do a query selector all
376:18 - to loop through all of them and apply
376:20 - the hidden class
376:21 - uh in this case we don't need to do that
376:24 - it's a little bit easier because we only
376:26 - have one that actually has
376:28 - we only have one tab that currently has
376:31 - the area selected of true on it and
376:33 - whenever we switch there should always
376:35 - only be one so for this instead of
376:37 - looping through all of them to find the
376:38 - one that has the false we don't need to
376:40 - do that you can just find the one that
376:41 - has an area selected of true on it
376:44 - switch it to false and then go through
376:46 - and choose the one that we need to be
376:48 - choosing like sort of like we did down
376:49 - here but there's an easier way to do
376:51 - that as well to add the area selected of
376:54 - true on there so if you want to try that
376:55 - out go ahead again it's a lot simpler
376:58 - than what we did here um so if you can
377:00 - sort of use this for inspiration but
377:02 - simplify things a little bit
377:06 - and so for this we're going to start
377:07 - with my tab container and we just do a
377:10 - query selector on here and i'm doing the
377:12 - tab container rather than the main
377:13 - container both would work but we're only
377:15 - looking at our tabs so i might as well
377:17 - just stick with our tab container i want
377:19 - to select and again there should only be
377:21 - one so i can do my
377:22 - area selected
377:24 - is equal to true on here if ever you do
377:27 - a query selector query selector is
377:28 - always going even if there's a 10 of
377:30 - these that were true it would stop at
377:32 - the first one whereas all will get every
377:34 - possible one so here we can't use a
377:36 - query selector on roll tab panel because
377:39 - it would stop and only get the first one
377:41 - in this case there should only be one
377:42 - and if there were multiple there's a
377:44 - problem so
377:45 - we shouldn't run into any issues but we
377:47 - can say select the one that is true and
377:49 - then set the attribute of area of the
377:52 - area selected to false
377:55 - and that means that it's no longer
377:58 - selected so let's actually try that out
377:59 - and see what happens so if i move over
378:01 - to mars and i select that one there you
378:03 - go it actually removed my selected from
378:05 - there because you can see our css
378:06 - styling got removed from it but now
378:08 - nothing is actually showing up as
378:09 - selected so what we can do and actually
378:12 - i'm just going to break this down onto
378:13 - another line just again to make it a
378:15 - little bit easier to read instead of
378:16 - having these really long
378:18 - um
378:18 - you know stretching off too long doesn't
378:20 - look too fantastic
378:22 - uh and then on this one what we can say
378:24 - is this one's a little bit easier
378:25 - because we want to get my target tab and
378:27 - we're just dealing with the tab itself
378:29 - we're not looking anywhere else so we
378:31 - can just say that my target tab
378:34 - has a we can actually just copy this
378:38 - paste it there and make this true
378:41 - and if we did this properly so when we
378:43 - whatever our target tab is we'll then
378:45 - get the area selected of true to show
378:47 - that is now activated so let's save that
378:50 - and let's click on mars and look at that
378:52 - it moved over and then we can choose
378:53 - europa and it moved over and so on and
378:55 - so forth and if i come through and use
378:58 - my arrows and then use my space bar
379:01 - same thing is still working so super
379:04 - super cool and i'm really happy with
379:06 - that one thing i'm going to do is go to
379:07 - my css and i think we can get rid of my
379:09 - lime green that i had on the focus date
379:11 - and i think the last thing we want to do
379:12 - on here is actually clean this up a
379:14 - little bit um it's getting a little bit
379:17 - long as a function just because there's
379:18 - lots of different things that are
379:19 - happening in here and there's a lot of
379:22 - repeated things that are going on that i
379:24 - think we can sort of simplify and make
379:26 - it into you know less less of what's
379:29 - going on here and simplify things a
379:31 - little bit so we'll look at that one in
379:33 - the next lesson
379:36 - so if we look in here right now when i
379:38 - say we can fix things up like right now
379:40 - this and this are almost the same and
379:43 - this here and this here are almost the
379:44 - same there's very very small differences
379:47 - between them and when you're doing
379:49 - things that are almost the same you can
379:51 - usually make a function out of them they
379:53 - can sort of make things a little bit
379:54 - easier and it's also going to make
379:57 - things a lot easier to read as well and
379:59 - so we're going to do is create a
380:00 - function down here so we're going to say
380:01 - function hide content
380:04 - and we're actually going to have a
380:05 - function of hide content and we're also
380:07 - going to have another one of function
380:10 - show content if something all right we
380:12 - want to do both of these things
380:14 - and so let's grab all of this and then
380:16 - see what we need to do with this to
380:18 - actually abstract it away
380:20 - and there's two important things here we
380:22 - have my main container and we have the
380:24 - content itself that we want to hide away
380:26 - so what i'm going to do is we want to be
380:28 - able to and like ideally this i guess
380:30 - could be plug and play and be used in
380:32 - different places what i'm going to say
380:33 - here is the parent because the because
380:35 - my main container is the parent of this
380:38 - so i'm saying the parent is i'm being
380:40 - able to select the parent so i could do
380:41 - this and use this in different ways and
380:44 - then i'm going to put the content itself
380:45 - here so first i'm selecting the parent
380:47 - and then i'm selecting the content
380:49 - within that parent that i want to be
380:50 - able to hide so that means my anywhere
380:53 - that this main container will become
380:55 - parent and anywhere that says
380:57 - the this will then become and when i'm
380:59 - saying anywhere it's just going to
381:00 - become content and because that's
381:02 - content panel doesn't make much sense so
381:04 - i will put item and item here as well so
381:06 - what that means is any i for we're going
381:09 - to loop through each item that is part
381:10 - of my content and it just abstracts
381:13 - everything that we've written here into
381:15 - what we have right here
381:17 - so then what we can do is we could take
381:19 - all of this and i'll comment it out for
381:21 - now instead of deleting it and see why
381:23 - don't you try and fill this out and see
381:24 - if you can get it to work
381:27 - all right so that would just be coming
381:28 - here and we would just have to write
381:30 - hide content the parent is my main
381:32 - container like that and then comma and
381:35 - my content is the tab panel exactly like
381:38 - i have it right here you can put it just
381:40 - like that
381:41 - and to double check if it's actually
381:43 - really working i'm also going to turn
381:44 - this one off because that's showing the
381:46 - next one i just want things to disappear
381:48 - to get a really visual and if it worked
381:50 - here we go it's hidden it away so that
381:53 - means we can delete this and we can turn
381:55 - this one back on for now so now we can
381:58 - go through and it is functioning
382:01 - so with that done we can also do the
382:04 - same thing for this one right here so
382:06 - here we can come and say hide content
382:10 - and in this case the parent is my main
382:13 - container once again main container and
382:15 - then what i'm trying to hide is my
382:17 - picture element so we can just grab a
382:18 - picture
382:20 - drop a picture in there we should be
382:21 - able to delete all that
382:23 - and once again let's turn this off and
382:25 - if this works the image should just
382:26 - disappear and there we go it is gone
382:29 - amazing
382:30 - so that means that we can turn this one
382:33 - back on so i think that's pretty cool
382:34 - and you saw how i did that to abstract
382:37 - away for hiding content so why don't you
382:39 - take your hand at making that work for
382:41 - the show content
382:46 - all right so i hope that went well for
382:48 - you and we're going to just take the
382:49 - show content which was this guy right
382:51 - here i'm going to copy him paste it and
382:53 - once again we'll just throw a parent
382:55 - here and the content here so the parent
382:58 - so the content that i want to show and
383:00 - that content's parent and then that just
383:02 - means that right here instead of having
383:04 - all this this becomes content
383:07 - and instead of main container i can
383:09 - write parent right there
383:11 - and we can get rid of my square bracket
383:13 - and i think that is good to go so then
383:15 - we can come over to here and instead of
383:17 - all of that we can say show content
383:21 - once again it's on my main container and
383:23 - in this case it will be this one right
383:25 - here paste that in we can delete that
383:28 - and if everything is going well we
383:30 - should also be able to do my show
383:33 - content here
383:34 - my main container and this time around
383:37 - it would be my target image that i want
383:39 - to put there and we can paste that right
383:41 - there and delete that and let's go and
383:44 - take a look
383:45 - everything should still be working
383:46 - fabulous so i'm super happy with that we
383:49 - can see it's all working
383:51 - and the advantage with doing something
383:52 - like this is first we're not repeating
383:54 - basically the same code two times we
383:56 - just have it once here and then we can
383:57 - reuse it as many times as we want and if
383:59 - we needed to use this in other ways and
384:02 - bring it into other functions where
384:03 - we're hiding things or showing things it
384:05 - becomes very easy to do and the main
384:07 - container here can also be switched out
384:09 - so it doesn't have to be something in
384:11 - these very specific circumstances and
384:14 - there we go i'm very happy with that and
384:15 - if ever the markup got changed and we
384:17 - changed a little bit of how the system
384:19 - is here we need to change the main
384:20 - container to something else it becomes
384:22 - fairly easy to do as well
384:24 - or if you need to use this in a
384:25 - different tab system where maybe the
384:27 - main container is different it becomes a
384:29 - little bit more robust it also becomes a
384:30 - little bit easier to read we have our
384:32 - function of change tab panel that's
384:34 - doing the area things right here and
384:36 - it's hiding in my main container my tab
384:38 - panels and then it's showing my target
384:40 - panel which is my target panel up here
384:43 - and then doing the same thing with my
384:45 - images and we can read it and then you
384:46 - want to know how that's working and you
384:47 - can come a little bit further down so
384:49 - it's a little bit less repeated code and
384:51 - a little bit more obvious that we're
384:52 - just hiding and showing and one other
384:54 - thing we could do is actually to come up
384:55 - and fix up things a little bit here just
384:57 - because these if statements we have a
384:58 - lot going on and i think we can make
385:00 - this also a little bit easier and the
385:02 - first thing is we're getting this we're
385:05 - saying if it's a key left or key right
385:07 - we want to do this and then we're saying
385:10 - if it's a key right to do this and then
385:11 - if it's the key left to do this and we
385:13 - have this going on as well and really
385:16 - all of these things we only want to be
385:18 - happening if it's a key left or key
385:20 - right and if not we can ignore all of
385:23 - this code here and it doesn't have to
385:24 - check those statements again so we can
385:26 - actually bring all of that up inside of
385:28 - here
385:29 - and let's just fix the formatting on
385:31 - this a little bit we can tab all that
385:32 - over
385:33 - tab all of this over like that
385:36 - and so now we're saying if it's a key
385:37 - left or key right we want to change the
385:39 - focus and then we can check was it out
385:42 - of these two was it actually a key right
385:45 - if not we can keep on going was it
385:46 - actually a key left if not we can keep
385:48 - on going
385:50 - and then even with this one we could do
385:51 - is bring this up and do an else if if
385:54 - it's a key
385:55 - down then we do this else if it's a cue
385:58 - left we can do this and technically you
386:00 - could even bring all of this off and
386:02 - just make it a complete like else
386:04 - statement so if it's a key right else do
386:06 - this one because we're checking is it
386:08 - cue right
386:09 - we're looking for either a key left or a
386:11 - key right and then is it a key right yes
386:14 - then do this else do that one because
386:15 - the only other option is a key left i'm
386:18 - personally going to leave it like this
386:19 - because i think it's a little bit if
386:20 - somewhere someone were to come into this
386:22 - code right away i think it's a little
386:24 - bit more clear that we're saying is it
386:26 - key right do this is it key left do this
386:29 - so even though it accomplishes the same
386:31 - thing with more code it's also more
386:33 - obvious what's happening so i don't
386:34 - think that's a bad thing and then as
386:36 - long as this was true we still want to
386:38 - run through this so it's all included in
386:40 - this one if statement instead of having
386:41 - a whole bunch of different ones so this
386:43 - entire block here won't be evaluated
386:45 - unless these are true instead of having
386:47 - to say is it a key left and then it's
386:49 - going to check again was it a key left
386:50 - so this just simplifies things a little
386:52 - bit
386:53 - and it won't have to check multiple
386:55 - things every time a key is pushed so
386:57 - let's hit save and let's just go check
386:59 - that's still working my keyboard
387:01 - navigation is still working and so with
387:03 - that we are good to go and we're ready
387:05 - to move on to the crew page
387:10 - okay so we finished that other tab
387:12 - system and now we have to come on to
387:13 - this crew page and set this one up and
387:16 - while things look a little bit different
387:17 - because we have these dots down here
387:18 - instead of it being that other system
387:20 - it's actually going to be super super
387:22 - similar to do and we don't have to
387:24 - reinvent the wheel which is obviously
387:26 - really nice and
387:27 - so what we're going to do is we're going
387:29 - to drop down to here and the first thing
387:31 - we need to do is on this i'm going to do
387:34 - it really fast let's rename this just to
387:36 - my regular crew.html because everything
387:39 - will be living in that one page and then
387:42 - you saw how i set everything up on the
387:44 - previous one so we do need to make a few
387:46 - changes to how this is set up right here
387:48 - and we also need to come through and
387:50 - sort of build this system out a little
387:52 - bit more so i'm just going to go ahead
387:54 - and let you tackle all of that and build
387:55 - everything out if you're not too sure
387:57 - about some of those roles or some of
387:59 - those other things you can refer back to
388:00 - when i set all of those up in the
388:02 - previous lessons or just the finished
388:03 - code right from the last one just to see
388:06 - if you're on the right page and i'm not
388:07 - going to give the solution in this one
388:09 - because i really do want you to tackle
388:11 - this in the next one i will do it but i
388:13 - will be moving a little bit faster but i
388:15 - really think you have everything you
388:17 - need to be able to at least get the
388:18 - stage set if not add the functionality
388:20 - as well because there's not too much we
388:22 - need to do just don't forget to link the
388:24 - javascript file because it's not
388:25 - currently linked to this one so yeah
388:27 - that's it for now i'm going to see you
388:28 - in the next one with my solution
388:34 - all right so for my solution i'm doing
388:36 - this so the first thing to do is
388:37 - actually give this an id of commander
388:39 - tab
388:40 - uh commander
388:42 - tab and with that what i can do is come
388:45 - over to my button right away and say
388:47 - that my area controls
388:49 - equals my commander tab
388:52 - so we've linked those two together like
388:54 - that and i'll copy and paste this onto
388:56 - these other buttons really fast
388:58 - and there we go we have a link between
389:00 - those and once again the other thing
389:02 - that we needed to do to link things
389:04 - together was to come on and create a
389:06 - data image
389:07 - and we'll do that really fast once again
389:10 - commander
389:11 - image and i'll change all of the other
389:13 - ones and i'll see you in just a second
389:15 - and so i'll start off this just by
389:17 - putting my id down here on my image as
389:19 - well before i forget to do that so that
389:21 - one was my commander image and we'll
389:24 - bring in the rest of the content after
389:26 - but i want to have everything in place
389:27 - so when i copy and paste i don't i can
389:28 - just make these little changes and i
389:29 - won't forget anything along the way uh
389:32 - the next thing that's really important
389:33 - on here is on this div itself and give
389:36 - this a rule of tab list as we that was
389:39 - something that was really really
389:40 - important and if you remember with that
389:42 - it's sort of useful to have a title that
389:44 - goes along with it so we can give that
389:46 - the title by giving that an area label
389:48 - and that will be my crew member
389:51 - list
389:52 - and so again the area label here means
389:55 - that when it gets to this even though
389:56 - there's no actual heading on here
389:58 - there's no you know that we don't have
389:59 - an h2 in h3 or something like that but
390:02 - the area label here will be read out
390:03 - crew member list and then we have these
390:04 - buttons and once again we have these sr
390:06 - only is where it's gonna be crew member
390:08 - list the commander the mission
390:10 - specialist the pilot the crew engineer
390:11 - even though when we go and look at this
390:13 - page none of that is actually here we
390:15 - don't see that but visually we can click
390:17 - through and do it but for a screen
390:19 - reader it just gives them a lot more
390:21 - context to be able to work
390:23 - now we added i added the role of tab
390:25 - list there so i'm going to come on to
390:26 - each one of these buttons and also add
390:29 - in the role that i need on here which is
390:31 - just the role of tab so role is equal to
390:34 - tab
390:36 - and that also means down here i will
390:38 - give this a roll of
390:39 - tab panel
390:41 - and there we go those are all in place
390:43 - now another thing that you might
390:45 - remember from our button list here that
390:47 - we were creating last time is we want
390:48 - these all to have tab indexes on them so
390:50 - this first one is selected so my tab
390:53 - index on this one will be equal to zero
390:55 - and then on all of my other buttons
390:58 - we want to come in and give each one of
391:00 - those ones a tab
391:02 - index
391:04 - is equal to negative one
391:06 - to negative one so it can't actually be
391:09 - selected and we're gonna have to use our
391:10 - keyboard navigation to go between the
391:12 - different tabs
391:14 - not only do we need to do that but we
391:15 - also need to give this a tab
391:18 - index a tab index of zero because it's
391:20 - important that we can then jump from the
391:23 - the different tab that we're on and then
391:25 - when we hit tab it's actually going to
391:26 - select the content that we have here
391:28 - um and for a screen reader it's gonna
391:31 - just help for to make it so they can
391:32 - actually access and read the content
391:34 - that's there without having to go
391:35 - through each tab so they get the tab
391:37 - they want they hit tab they select it
391:39 - then they can push tab and get the
391:40 - content related to the one that they've
391:42 - just selected again if you're making
391:44 - changes to tab indexes be very very
391:47 - careful and make sure there's a very
391:48 - good reason to be doing it the next
391:50 - thing i'm going to do is just bring in
391:51 - all of my other articles and images so
391:53 - i'll fast forward as i do that
391:55 - all right so with all that in place i
391:57 - make sure that all of these have the id
391:59 - that is linked with what i'd set up
392:00 - above same with these all the ids that
392:02 - are the right ids that we need so
392:04 - everything is properly linked with our
392:06 - buttons that are here
392:08 - the one issue is everything is
392:09 - overlapping so we do don't forget that
392:11 - we need the hidden attribute on every
392:13 - single one of these except for the very
392:15 - first one because we want to make sure
392:16 - that we have some content on the screen
392:18 - before it all starts so we know throw
392:21 - our head in there and then we can come
392:22 - down onto our pictures here as well and
392:25 - throw the hidden on there
392:26 - and what's beautiful about all that is
392:28 - even though it's so visually different
392:30 - we're here it's this tab these like dot
392:32 - systems whereas that other page was very
392:34 - different in how it looked where we had
392:35 - like a real tab system going on
392:38 - if we come up to here and we throw on
392:41 - our
392:43 - tabs.js
392:44 - and i hit save
392:46 - it all went well
392:48 - there we go look at that it's working we
392:50 - don't have to do anything else it's it's
392:51 - just functioning um there are a few
392:54 - little things where you can see the page
392:55 - is actually jumping and changing in
392:56 - height because of the different images
392:58 - that are coming in
392:59 - and because of how the the whole system
393:02 - is is really set up
393:04 - and so that could be a little thing that
393:06 - throws people off a little bit
393:07 - especially this image seems much taller
393:09 - than the other ones so it is um throwing
393:12 - a little bit of a wrench in the works on
393:14 - that but if you notice how we set all
393:16 - this up on
393:17 - this is very similar to we spent a lot
393:19 - of time on our design system and it took
393:21 - us quite a while to set up and then we
393:23 - got to the home page and we had more
393:24 - layout stuff to do but things started
393:26 - coming together pretty fast as we were
393:29 - doing this one
393:30 - and then from there we went and started
393:32 - styling up our destination page and that
393:34 - one the styling on it went quite a bit
393:36 - faster and there was a few little things
393:38 - on getting stuff where we needed to but
393:40 - it came together pretty quickly and then
393:42 - finally we made it on over to our crew
393:45 - page and that one the styling of it went
393:47 - even faster than that because so much
393:49 - was already done and in place
393:51 - and now even though visually things are
393:53 - very different
393:54 - they are coming together so quickly with
393:56 - the javascript because we've heard it
393:57 - once and we just need to set everything
393:59 - up properly and it's working exactly
394:01 - like we need it to here so in the next
394:03 - few lessons i'm going to just address on
394:04 - cleaning up some of the loose ends
394:06 - making sure our pages are linked
394:07 - together fixing up any weird things that
394:09 - might be happening and making sure
394:10 - everything is good and then i'll talk to
394:12 - you a little bit about the final page
394:19 - all right so i thought we had a little
394:20 - bit of an issue with the linking of the
394:21 - pages but it's actually working since we
394:23 - changed the names before but there is
394:24 - the issue if it's not highlighting the
394:26 - right page and this one here is not
394:27 - actually going anywhere so to me
394:29 - explorer should go to destination so
394:30 - let's start there just by making sure
394:33 - that my do do do explore we can change
394:36 - this over to my destination.html
394:39 - um the next thing we want to do is make
394:41 - sure that when we're going to all these
394:42 - different pages like i said that white
394:44 - line is actually going with us and with
394:46 - how i've set things up there's no
394:48 - dynamic way to do it um i often get
394:50 - asked about things like this it's really
394:52 - just where this class is now there's
394:53 - dynamic ways of doing it if you're using
394:55 - a javascript framework maybe you've
394:56 - already set things up so it's working by
394:58 - itself and it can handle that without
395:00 - you having to do any work or even a
395:01 - static site generator can handle that
395:03 - but i did this just with static html and
395:06 - css so that just does mean when i go to
395:08 - my destination page i do need to find my
395:11 - index take the active class off of here
395:14 - and just stick it on right there where i
395:17 - need it there so now if we go and take a
395:19 - look it's going to be on the destination
395:22 - and it follows me from page to page and
395:24 - now we want the same thing for the crew
395:26 - page so let's jump on over there i would
395:28 - give this to you as a challenge but it's
395:30 - not really much of a challenge at this
395:31 - point so i'll do it without you needing
395:34 - to take over for me
395:36 - and
395:37 - there we go
395:38 - that is working and so now if we go over
395:40 - to my crew page we can see that it is
395:42 - working over there as well so i think
395:45 - that's really cool i'm really happy with
395:46 - that um one of the things that is
395:48 - bugging me a little bit is here how uh
395:51 - the text difference here is actually
395:53 - causing the actually it depends on the
395:55 - screen size because here it's not doing
395:56 - it we go a little bit bigger though the
395:58 - mars text is shorter than this one and
396:00 - it's
396:01 - it's not actually bothering me that the
396:03 - text is different because whatever uh so
396:05 - that's going to happen and it doesn't
396:07 - really matter but what bothers me is
396:08 - that the image is actually moving a
396:10 - little bit and i believe the reason
396:12 - that's happening is because of the
396:13 - alignment on the picture that we have
396:15 - here
396:16 - so let's go in into my css.index over
396:19 - here and
396:20 - we're going to go and find that image
396:22 - and this one is really on the
396:24 - destination page
396:25 - is the only one that i'm really worried
396:27 - about where this is going to happen so
396:29 - we have our destination grid container
396:30 - with our picture so we're selecting it
396:32 - there
396:33 - and for this if you want to think of a
396:35 - line of css that might fix this go ahead
396:37 - and do it right now and then i'll look
396:38 - at a solution in just a second
396:41 - so we are on a grid and with grid items
396:44 - are becoming stretched by default and
396:46 - the way the picture works is the
396:47 - pictures and so what i think all we need
396:50 - to do actually here is an align
396:51 - uh self of start
396:54 - and i'm pretty sure if we do that and
396:56 - they're all lined up at the start now
396:58 - the image doesn't jump even if the
397:00 - content becomes shorter and it was just
397:02 - an issue of the grid getting too short
397:04 - and because the grid was short because
397:06 - the grid here has less lines like this
397:08 - was stretching before and sort of trying
397:09 - to fit into that space and now it just
397:12 - lines up across the top on all the pages
397:14 - so we don't get that jumping on we can
397:16 - shrink our page down everything's
397:17 - looking good we can still use our tab
397:19 - system and everything's working fine
397:22 - we can keep on going down and then we
397:24 - get to the mobile sizes where everything
397:25 - is still working so i think that looks
397:27 - pretty awesome one thing you might
397:29 - notice here is if we're at a smaller
397:31 - screen size and it's going to be when
397:33 - it's really on the border so maybe right
397:35 - around here
397:36 - notice how here between mars and the
397:38 - moon it does jump a little bit because
397:40 - there's with a scroll bar and without a
397:41 - scroll bar if that drives you nuts and
397:44 - you want to try and fix that there is a
397:46 - new css property that has come out which
397:48 - enables pages even when there is no
397:50 - scroll bar to have some space that is
397:52 - available on the sides to try and
397:54 - prevent that type of content jumping
397:56 - from going on and it's called scroll bar
397:58 - gutter so actually it's just right here
398:01 - really fast it would be on your html um
398:04 - so it's called
398:06 - so it's a scroll bar gutter like that
398:09 - that's the name of the property i'd
398:10 - encourage you to look it up and play
398:12 - with it and see if you can get that to
398:13 - solve this but this is one of those
398:15 - types of things with dynamic content
398:16 - that can happen where some pages are
398:18 - longer and some are shorter and the
398:20 - scroll bar gutter right now does not
398:21 - have wide browser support um it wouldn't
398:23 - break anything if you added it just
398:25 - because browsers that do support it
398:27 - which is chrome
398:28 - it would work and then browsers that
398:29 - don't support it it just wouldn't work
398:31 - so they would get the old they would
398:33 - just get this experience anyway so it's
398:35 - not like it would just all of a sudden
398:36 - cause the site to break so if you want
398:38 - to look into scroll bar gutter you could
398:40 - do that
398:41 - the only other thing though that i do
398:43 - want to fix is on this one with the
398:45 - image that gets way too long which is
398:47 - this one and it's kind of interesting
398:49 - why that's happening and it just has to
398:51 - come down to the native sizes of these
398:53 - images being a little bit different and
398:56 - ideally the grid would actually be a
398:58 - little bit different because in front
399:00 - end mentor you'll notice here he has a
399:01 - lot less space he has a lot less space
399:04 - than say these other guys so she's
399:06 - actually pushed off a little bit more
399:08 - he's taking up less space and this is
399:10 - taking up way more than 50
399:12 - of my grid like i have it set up now
399:14 - like on these other ones that doesn't
399:16 - really work
399:17 - if you wanted to you could actually come
399:19 - up with a unique grid for each one that
399:21 - where the grid spacing becomes a little
399:23 - bit different for this to work or you
399:25 - might be able to find other solutions
399:26 - including the potential of overlapping
399:28 - content with the name where the name
399:30 - would be allowed to sort of overlap but
399:32 - i think you might run into more problems
399:34 - than that could help but one thing we
399:35 - can definitely do for something like
399:37 - this is on our another destination page
399:40 - we want to find our crew
399:41 - grid
399:42 - and we could redefine what the grid was
399:45 - but actually you want to be really
399:46 - careful with that if you want to
399:48 - if we want to make that change just
399:50 - because we'd want to first go into our
399:52 - media query so let's find our original
399:55 - one here where we're setting up this
399:56 - grid
399:57 - of having these different columns i'm
399:59 - going to copy that same one and make
400:00 - sure that i'm changing it based on this
400:03 - and it's not my destination but it's
400:05 - going to be my crew and i could come in
400:07 - and change it here and instead of a
400:09 - repeat and having the same thing for
400:10 - both of them so we get rid of this in
400:13 - the middle so we can come in with a
400:15 - a min max here and we'll do a second one
400:18 - min max here and for these they'll both
400:20 - start with zero just like we had before
400:22 - but before we had them both they were
400:24 - adding up to 60 and we did a 30 30 we
400:26 - can do a 40 ram on that side and a 20
400:29 - ram on this side so we're just giving
400:31 - this side a lot less space this one more
400:34 - space and i do think that's actually
400:36 - more true to what the design was in the
400:38 - beginning anyway and so with that our
400:39 - image has less room and our text has
400:41 - more room so we have got the bonus of
400:43 - the names actually not breaking and
400:45 - going at large screen sizes at least not
400:47 - breaking and going all the way across
400:49 - now some of the images are getting a
400:50 - little bit tiny so i do have a nice
400:53 - little thing here but you'll also notice
400:54 - that the text doesn't actually have
400:56 - enough room and its alignment is a
400:58 - little bit off so the same way that we
401:00 - did a justify items and an align content
401:02 - start here on our destination we could
401:05 - use the same justify item start over on
401:08 - this one here as well so right there we
401:10 - can throw that and that would fix that
401:12 - issue
401:13 - and that means we wouldn't need this one
401:14 - anymore so i'll delete that from there
401:16 - and we can go take a look and now we see
401:18 - everything is lined up nice and square
401:20 - on that side but the image is definitely
401:21 - looking like it's a little bit too small
401:25 - because it is smaller maybe we'd be
401:27 - comfortable bringing this back on and
401:28 - maybe we wouldn't run into those issues
401:30 - at larger screen sizes so i'll throw
401:32 - that back on just in case we end up
401:34 - wanting it but the image definitely
401:36 - looks like it's getting too small so one
401:38 - thing we could do is maybe this could be
401:40 - like a 23 and this could be a 37 or you
401:43 - could find a nice balance between them
401:45 - that would give you enough space for
401:46 - your text but there is one more thing
401:48 - that'd be a little bit fun and it's
401:50 - something that you could potentially use
401:52 - when you get to your next pages because
401:54 - you can see this guy is not looking too
401:55 - bad maybe he could be a little bit
401:57 - bigger and i will do two things because
401:59 - they're a little bit smaller than i
402:00 - thought they would be i'm going to take
402:01 - this crew one off from here and we'll
402:03 - just leave this one by itself
402:06 - and then i'll actually we'll copy that
402:08 - whole thing
402:09 - and
402:10 - right here it will work so here we can
402:11 - just do the max width of 100
402:14 - and that will help uh
402:16 - increase it a little bit so we're
402:18 - working with a little bit more space and
402:20 - the destination i think the 90 worked
402:21 - really well but here i think you can
402:23 - agree that this is working better but
402:24 - they're still
402:26 - they're still not as big maybe as you'd
402:27 - want them to be so i am going to show
402:29 - you and again this is being limited by
402:31 - the width that they have available to
402:33 - them so this is something you could use
402:35 - on the final page as well and actually
402:36 - you'd have to use it on the final page
402:38 - so it's a little bit of a hint that on
402:40 - here we could say the grid column even
402:43 - though it's on the grid area image we
402:44 - can sort of cheat a little bit and say
402:46 - there's a span too
402:48 - and what that means is it's allowed to
402:49 - break into the right side and it's
402:52 - allowed to break into that final column
402:53 - that we had and by doing that the images
402:56 - are allowed to get a little bit bigger
402:58 - than they were before and things start
403:00 - coming together a little bit nicer and i
403:02 - think that looks a little bit better um
403:05 - maybe then we'd actually limit this down
403:07 - back down to an 80 or a 90. pop that
403:09 - back down to the 90 that we had but you
403:10 - could find like a nice balance to try
403:12 - and get it on and i don't think you'd
403:13 - ever really run into any issues at
403:15 - larger screen sizes
403:17 - uh that that could pop up i think that
403:19 - would actually work pretty well just
403:20 - letting it bleed off into the right side
403:22 - a little bit and so i'm actually pretty
403:24 - happy with that i think it's a nice
403:25 - little way we can cheat a little bit and
403:27 - it's definitely something we could use
403:28 - when we do our technology page which
403:30 - i'll be talking about in the next lesson
403:36 - all right so it's time for the
403:37 - technology page which is an interesting
403:39 - page there's a few little differences
403:40 - with how the layout is working we have a
403:42 - different type of component to do the
403:45 - the tab system that we had before
403:47 - obviously we have these images that
403:48 - bleed out which i sort of talked about a
403:50 - little bit in the last lesson and of
403:52 - course we have the different ways of
403:53 - laying it all out through the different
403:55 - screen sizes but very importantly
403:58 - you are on your own for this one i am
404:00 - not holding your hand i'm not walking
404:01 - you through the process anymore while
404:03 - there are a few differences with certain
404:05 - things that we just saw and there's some
404:07 - new parts that you'll have to build out
404:08 - outer style you have learned everything
404:11 - you need to get this done i've been
404:13 - trying to challenge you along the way up
404:14 - until now as much as possible a lot of
404:17 - you i'm sure we're killing it and doing
404:19 - those challenges whether it was the
404:20 - really big things or just the little
404:22 - questions i had here or there but at one
404:25 - point i do need to let go and let you
404:27 - figure things out on your own if you
404:28 - really want to reinforce everything
404:30 - you've learned and whether you've been
404:32 - doing all those little challenges take
404:34 - all of what you've learned and apply it
404:36 - now and if you haven't been doing them
404:37 - it's even doubly important because
404:39 - watching something and understanding it
404:41 - is very different from being able to
404:43 - apply it yourself so i really hope you
404:45 - enjoyed following along with me up until
404:47 - now i've really enjoyed it but now it is
404:50 - your turn to go and make those pages
404:52 - happen once you finish the page make
404:54 - sure that you post it and let us know
404:56 - about it if you're posting over on
404:57 - twitter make sure you mention me scrimba
404:59 - and front-end mentor to show us how you
405:01 - finish things up i really hope that
405:02 - you've enjoyed this course i've really
405:04 - enjoyed giving it i really enjoyed
405:05 - building out this layout it was a lot of
405:06 - fun and so i'm looking forward to seeing
405:09 - how you finish it up and the
405:10 - improvements you can make to it from
405:12 - where i've left you right here
