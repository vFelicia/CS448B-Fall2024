00:10 - hey everybody it's
00:12 - Jesse and uh I hope everyone had a good
00:16 - weekend today I am
00:19 - streaming at home from my basement so uh
00:24 - the quality might not be as good as it
00:27 - has been uh so I'm hoping to get full
00:30 - 480 uh 480p
00:32 - quality and that's about as good as I
00:35 - can get uh I've tried to get better
00:37 - quality before but it ends up just
00:39 - buffering a lot for everyone so uh this
00:42 - is it for
00:43 - now and uh not much I can do about it I
00:46 - already have the best internet I can buy
00:49 - at this location uh so unless I move I'm
00:52 - stuck with it uh the internet at my
00:55 - office was down today uh then they got
00:58 - it working but it was on and off so I
01:02 - decided not to risk it and I would just
01:04 - work from
01:06 - home
01:09 - uh
01:13 - see I see in the live chat Nathaniel
01:16 - says you can get Google fivr uh pay them
01:18 - a million
01:21 - dollars for like a half a second I was
01:24 - like wait I can get Google Fiber uh and
01:26 - then I saw the next comment so let me
01:29 - know know if you all can hear me I have
01:31 - a little bit of a different setup uh
01:33 - usually I have a um like an external mic
01:35 - and I don't uh that's a at the office uh
01:39 - so I'm just using the mic that's in my
01:41 - MacBook and my laptop is actually on my
01:44 - lap so I don't even know where the mic
01:48 - is in this thing I just hope I'm not
01:50 - covering it up accidentally but uh if
01:53 - you have trouble hearing me let me
01:55 - know uh first I want to go over what
01:58 - I've done
02:00 - uh since I did the last stream so
02:04 - basically what I've done this
02:07 - morning and I also go over a pull
02:09 - request that I
02:12 - got and then we'll get started Okay cool
02:16 - so sounds like everyone can hear me uh
02:20 - so good that was all I was worried about
02:23 - uh there's since I'm in the basement my
02:26 - air conditioner is down here so
02:30 - I hope you can't hear it in the
02:32 - background it doesn't sound too bad
02:34 - right now but let me know all right so
02:38 - enough with the sound let me uh let me
02:39 - show
02:42 - you let me show you what's been done so
02:44 - I added show the package Json
02:47 - first uh make this a bit
02:51 - bigger all right so we already
02:56 - had this first three but I've added
02:59 - react
03:02 - router
03:04 - and I'll show you how I set up the
03:07 - router uh in a minute but then I also
03:10 - added uh a uh pre-commit hook so I
03:13 - pulled this over from our last project
03:16 - and I think I think it was uh V who had
03:20 - the pull request in the last project
03:23 - that we did that set up prettier and um
03:27 - standard JS and it just enforced the
03:29 - style rules so I wanted to set this up
03:32 - early on so that if you all uh want to
03:37 - submit a pull request you know all the
03:39 - code will all be in the same same format
03:42 - all the time so that's set up
03:45 - now and um let's see what
03:49 - else all right just a little bit uh to
03:53 - configure
03:55 - uh standard
03:57 - JS these are all the packages so I added
04:00 - them as Dev
04:01 - dependencies so Babel es lint husky lint
04:05 - staged prettier and
04:09 - standard uh so if you're not familiar
04:11 - with that basically all it does is every
04:13 - time I go to commit so I do a get
04:16 - commit uh it checks all of my
04:20 - JavaScript and it formats it
04:23 - automatically so I have it set to use
04:26 - single quotes and no semicolons so
04:30 - um and then all the the normal standard
04:34 - JS rules so you can check out standard
04:36 - JS and see what those rules are if
04:38 - you're
04:39 - interested um so standard JS is the set
04:42 - of rules prettier is the thing that
04:46 - actually applies those rules to the code
04:49 - to format uh the code and tell you the
04:53 - truth I'm not exactly sure what husky is
04:55 - like I said V is the one that submitted
04:57 - this pool request the last time so I
04:59 - know it works
05:00 - but I'm not 100% sure how it works but
05:03 - I'm not worried about that because I
05:06 - mean really
05:07 - like look at these node modules I don't
05:10 - know how most of these things work but
05:13 - they
05:15 - work and that's how pretty much
05:17 - everybody's projects are nowadays okay
05:20 - so that's it for the package Json um let
05:24 - me show you how I set up the router so I
05:28 - imported browser router route and Link
05:31 - from react router
05:33 - Dom and uh for so for react router when
05:36 - you bring it in you have to bring in Dom
05:38 - because there's also react router you
05:39 - know for other things like for Native
05:42 - and different things so uh make sure to
05:44 - remember the Dom I'm not even sure if
05:46 - there is a react router
05:48 - package um I never really
05:51 - checked so you pull that in I wrap
05:54 - everything in this browser
05:57 - router and then within it
06:00 - I can make links like this so here's my
06:02 - my side drawer menu now and instead of
06:07 - normal like a tags I have these link
06:09 - tags and instead of an href I say two
06:12 - and then I just put the
06:15 - route and then I've made some routes
06:17 - down here just to to kind of make sure
06:20 - it's working and give me an idea and
06:23 - everyone in idea of these are all the
06:25 - views that we need to make so each one
06:27 - of these routes is is a different
06:30 - view so the home view right now every
06:34 - route right now just has an
06:37 - H1 uh but when you click on this route
06:40 - it'll render whatever you have inside
06:42 - the render function for the route So
06:44 - eventually it's going to render one of
06:48 - these views which so I made Pages for
06:50 - each View and it might be hard to see
06:52 - there on the
06:53 - side um but for each view I've made a
06:56 - separate component and I put it in a
06:58 - views folder so each one of these routes
07:01 - will render that view and then
07:04 - everything for each view will go into
07:06 - that component so it'll be separated out
07:08 - pretty nicely we reuse for every view
07:11 - the same title bar and the same drawer
07:14 - uh side drawer with the links here so
07:16 - this is outside of all the routes and
07:19 - that's pretty cool so that means the
07:20 - entire page pretty much never has to
07:22 - render refresh because you know this is
07:26 - this app bar is going to stay the same
07:29 - uh throughout all of
07:32 - it okay so that's it for what I've done
07:35 - let me show you
07:37 - what um what Sebastian uh did with his
07:41 - pool
07:51 - request okay I see in the live chat it
07:53 - says uh Maxim May says you can autof
07:55 - format the code on Save uh with es lent
07:58 - and vs code yeah I have I actually have
08:03 - something that's autof formatting things
08:04 - for me like as I type uh but the thing
08:08 - with this is it um it enforces it across
08:12 - for everyone so anyone who um who clones
08:16 - this repo it will enforce the same style
08:19 - rules for them uh and they don't have to
08:23 - regardless of how they have their editor
08:24 - set
08:25 - up uh
08:27 - so yeah also I'm not using visual studio
08:30 - code for this project so I'm using Adam
08:33 - uh I have another project where I'm
08:35 - using visual studio code but I'm sure
08:37 - there's a plugin for adom as well
08:41 - um but anyway in this case I don't have
08:44 - to worry about plugins or anything I
08:46 - could load this in any
08:48 - editor um and regardless of how I loaded
08:52 - it uh it's still going to format
08:54 - properly like I could open it up in Nano
08:57 - on a server and change something and as
08:59 - long as I commit it it's still going to
09:02 - format
09:03 - properly I would probably never edit any
09:05 - files on a server in Nano
09:08 - but I might have unless I was setting up
09:11 - the server
09:12 - initially um all right so let me pull
09:16 - over on my other screen I'm trying to
09:18 - find the uh the pull request
09:30 - let's
09:33 - see I don't know why this is not right
09:35 - at the top oh my there we
09:40 - go Resource
09:47 - Center
09:48 - okay uh let's go P request
09:53 - and I'll bring this over now you all can
09:58 - see you can check this
10:00 - out if you want to check it out in more
10:03 - depth I'm just going to go over it
10:04 - really briefly just want to give credit
10:07 - uh to Sebastian for doing this
10:11 - and oh this is
10:15 - weird that's kind of why is it doing
10:18 - that
10:20 - anyway I wanted it to
10:23 - uh um get bigger but it just got taller
10:28 - I wanted it to take up the full screen
10:30 - uh so anyway I want to give credit to
10:32 - Sebastian for um making this pull
10:35 - request so you can see uh you know what
10:39 - he says about it
10:41 - here
10:43 - uh so proper theme if you remember last
10:47 - time we were talking about the theme and
10:51 - um how we we had kind of gone through
10:54 - and figured out how to customize the
10:56 - theme but I never hooked up
10:59 - I made like a separate file for the
11:01 - theme but then I ended up just testing
11:04 - it out right in the uh index.js
11:08 - file uh with an object there instead of
11:11 - linking up the separate file which would
11:13 - have been the better way to do it so
11:14 - Sebastian went
11:16 - ahead and linked everything up so you
11:19 - can kind of see a lot of you know what's
11:21 - going on here so he Imports Fus theme
11:24 - that's the file you know that we had
11:26 - made uh so he Imports that and then then
11:30 - for this theme here he says get get mui
11:34 - theme and then he brings in that Fus
11:36 - theme here okay
11:41 - so really helpful uh be able to kind of
11:46 - you know do all this so that we can
11:48 - start up now and you know just get right
11:51 - to it uh not have to worry about setting
11:53 - this this up and let's
11:57 - see test
12:04 - [Music]
12:07 - and all right so this is the file this
12:10 - is the uh theme file you can see
12:16 - here and then in
12:19 - index uh he's removed you know all the
12:22 - stuff that we had in here and I think it
12:25 - was uh Patrick had the idea to make
12:28 - leave the index file as clean as
12:30 - possible and uh to to wrap inside the
12:35 - app component to wrap everything instead
12:37 - of wrapping it here like we had done so
12:39 - it's clean and I I took that same idea
12:42 - in with in terms of the router and I
12:46 - wrapped browser router around the app
12:50 - component in the app file uh not not in
12:55 - um in the
12:56 - index Okay so thanks again Sebastian I
13:00 - really appreciate
13:02 - that and now let me show you there's
13:07 - really not much that happened in terms
13:09 - of like visually what you can see uh but
13:13 - I'll show you
13:15 - anyway you can see I still have not
13:18 - filled out my Trello board I don't want
13:20 - to bring over the
13:24 - site
13:27 - and I'm just running it on Local Host so
13:29 - I can just pull it up right
13:35 - here okay so here it is but now so now
13:39 - we have our home View and you can see
13:41 - here uh have these great default link
13:44 - Styles but I can click on it and you see
13:46 - it changed and the URL changed and now
13:49 - we're at the poster view so obviously
13:52 - you notice we need to do something to
13:54 - make this app drawer automatically close
13:56 - because that's not really the expected
13:58 - Behavior
14:00 - uh when you when you click normally you
14:03 - want it to close on click so I'm I'm
14:05 - actually somewhat surprised that that's
14:06 - not the default
14:09 - um so we're going to I'm going to check
14:11 - out the documentation for material UI
14:14 - and see how to do
14:16 - that uh and then we can get
14:19 - into I guess probably start out with the
14:21 - home View and start building that out so
14:26 - let me
14:27 - check I'm just going to scroll through
14:29 - the live chat briefly just to uh say hi
14:32 - see if there's any any new people in
14:35 - here looks like there's some some people
14:37 - I haven't seen before so hi and
14:57 - welcome okay
15:06 - all right so uh Patrick says didn't you
15:10 - say you were working with your laptop on
15:14 - on your lap how do you have multiple
15:16 - screens in the configuration so uh yeah
15:20 - I just have um I have my my recliner
15:25 - scooted up as close as possible to a
15:28 - table that's set up like pretty high so
15:31 - that the recliner can actually go
15:33 - underneath
15:34 - it uh so it's scooted up pretty close
15:37 - and I have pretty decently long cables
15:40 - so I have um you know my laptop and then
15:43 - two monitors connected to it right now
15:46 - so
15:48 - uh um it's it's an odd setup I you when
15:52 - I was freelancing I used to work like
15:55 - this all the
15:56 - time um so it's a little weird for me to
15:59 - get used to it from being at like a
16:01 - normal desk and a normal desk chair uh
16:05 - but I'm kind of getting used to it it's
16:08 - not too
16:10 - bad uh so anyway that's how I have my
16:13 - setup if you want to see my setup I um I
16:15 - put it on Instagram earlier uh just to
16:18 - kind of show the the weirdness of of my
16:20 - setup so it's the last thing I posted if
16:24 - anyone anyone's interested uh usually
16:27 - when I work from home I I don't work in
16:29 - the basement but uh my kids are home and
16:33 - they had friends over and so they're in
16:36 - they're upstairs and I'm downstairs
16:39 - otherwise uh it would be way too noisy
16:42 - to do
16:43 - anything all right so first I do want to
16:47 - I want to fix we proba let's fix two
16:49 - things let's make it close on click and
16:52 - then let's style these links a bit
16:53 - because we we obviously don't want to
16:55 - keep the links like this so I'm actually
16:58 - even wondering if there's some sort of
17:01 - Link component in material UI that I
17:04 - just wasn't
17:06 - using uh so we'll
17:11 - see so I'm going to check out I have the
17:14 - material UI docs open I think
17:22 - already I think I had them open on my
17:24 - other screen yep I did all right
17:34 - oh actually we we did discuss going back
17:37 - to material UI um the Alpha
17:42 - version and I haven't done that
17:45 - yet uh and I think some of you had said
17:49 - that you
17:50 - can
17:52 - um basically pull components from the
17:55 - new version and use them with the old
17:58 - version
17:59 - so that's probably what I'll end up
18:03 - doing instead of you know entirely going
18:06 - over to the new
18:07 - version that should help keep things I
18:10 - think a bit more stable hopefully I'm
18:12 - I'm I'm hoping that we can get the best
18:14 - of both worlds and have the stability of
18:18 - you know the older version but then be
18:20 - able to grab some of the components that
18:22 - we want from the new version so
18:24 - hopefully it works out like that if it
18:27 - doesn't then
18:29 - we might just switch to the Alpha
18:31 - version We we'll see when we get
18:33 - there which will be soon uh because
18:36 - we'll need to use I do want to use those
18:38 - columns uh that are in the newer
18:40 - version all right so on my other screen
18:44 - I'm just looking at the documentation
18:46 - for material
18:50 - UI
18:53 - and I'm assuming that there's just some
18:57 - option that needs to be set to true or
19:00 - false to uh close it on on
19:20 - click h
19:31 - all right if the
19:36 - dra oh okay I think I know what's going
19:41 - on let me
19:46 - see oh no that's it I did have that set
19:49 - I thought for a second I had this set
19:51 - incorrectly but I don't
20:04 - actually I do want to
20:07 - see I had wondered if uh it might be
20:13 - better to have the sidebar open all the
20:19 - time but I'm not sure that's not really
20:22 - what people are used to right now from
20:23 - the old uh the older version of of this
20:26 - that we're making uh so have to think
20:29 - about it either way it still needs to
20:31 - close on click because on a smaller
20:33 - screen it obviously wouldn't stay open
20:35 - so you still need to figure that
20:38 - out okay so stay
20:43 - open on request
20:47 - change okay so what am I doing here on
20:49 - this on request change
21:13 - I'm guessing that maybe this
21:18 - is open State requested to be changed
21:22 - yeah maybe this is the problem
21:28 - let me check I want to check the live
21:30 - chat quickly just see if any of you have
21:34 - um given some sort of answer it's
21:36 - possible that you some of you may have
21:38 - already used material UI and have gone
21:41 - through the same thing and know the
21:50 - answer oh Rohan uh Rohan is a regular
21:55 - here in the live chat and uh he's not
21:57 - feeling well today so sorry about that I
22:00 - hope you feel
22:01 - better and uh get some sleep cuz I know
22:04 - what it's probably midnight in India
22:06 - right now so yeah get some sleep and get
22:18 - better okay we have to say hello from
22:21 - Vienna Austria hey thanks for joining
22:23 - from
22:24 - Austria actually the university that I
22:26 - work at has a remote campus in Austria
22:30 - in um in gaming so I'm not exactly sure
22:34 - how that how far gaming is from Vienna
22:37 - I've never been to the other campus
22:39 - but uh that would be cool I can't I
22:43 - can't think of any reason why they would
22:44 - need to send me to the campus since I
22:46 - can work from
22:48 - anywhere but if I can think of a reason
22:50 - I'm going to try
22:51 - to uh to get a trip to Austria for work
23:02 - all right mod said hi uh from India and
23:05 - you're a good teacher well thanks I
23:06 - appreciate that
23:30 - okay all right
23:35 - so all right Patrick says um haven't
23:39 - used a library but you can define a
23:40 - click Handler function that set state to
23:43 - to
23:44 - close uh and add that to the
23:47 - links um yeah that's what I was kind of
23:50 - thinking is just have that click I I was
23:52 - just
23:54 - wondering there has to be some built-in
23:56 - way of doing this because this this is
23:58 - not it's not like some weird thing we're
24:01 - trying to do this is normal behavior so
24:04 - um in I I kind of would
24:10 - like to check it out let's see the do
24:14 - example undocked let me see the undocked
24:18 - example uh so if you want to follow
24:20 - along it's uh materialen ui.com and I'm
24:25 - checking out the documentation on the
24:27 - drawer I'm not putting it on my other
24:29 - screen because since the uh the video
24:32 - quality is is lower today uh there's
24:35 - probably not there's not really much of
24:38 - a chance that it's going to be legible
24:40 - for most people so I'm just going to
24:42 - leave the code up on the screen uh and
24:45 - then do like kind of the research part
24:49 - on the other screen if it's something
24:50 - really important that I think you all
24:52 - would like to see I will pull it
24:55 - over all right so right now I'm looking
24:58 - looking at their example
25:00 - code just to
25:02 - see on tap touch this handle
25:11 - okay I think I found
25:18 - it no did I know
25:34 - okay I found it Patrick you were
25:37 - actually uh on the right track
25:41 - completely so basically your idea of
25:43 - adding um a click Handler to the
25:46 - links was exactly how they handle that
25:50 - uh so it's it's nothing that I put on
25:52 - the drawer but on these menu items
25:55 - that's where I need to put
25:58 - The Click Handler so I'm going to go
26:02 - through and just select all of
26:05 - these and add this ontouch tap this
26:10 - handle
26:13 - close all right so now let's
26:19 - go check this
26:24 - out is it not
26:34 - H all right well that's how it
26:37 - was let me double check that I did that
26:39 - correctly all right it is supposed to be
26:41 - on the menu item on touch tab was
26:54 - um I wonder oh okay I see
26:59 - I forgot some other stuff as
27:16 - well I need to
27:18 - actually add in handle
27:23 - clothes because what's the point in
27:26 - calling a function if you didn't Define
27:29 - the function in the first place all
27:31 - right so this is what I was
27:34 - missing so obviously if you didn't catch
27:37 - my mistake I was calling this handle
27:40 - close but there was no handle close
27:43 - function so here it is now so now it
27:47 - should
27:49 - work all right
27:52 - awesome well that one wasn't so awesome
27:55 - because it didn't oh okay
27:58 - all right I don't know if you noticed
27:59 - this so the behavior that I'm getting
28:01 - now is
28:03 - that the it only is a link if I actually
28:07 - click the
28:09 - link it it's only doing the routing if I
28:12 - click over here it still shuts it but it
28:14 - doesn't route so we need to fix that and
28:17 - probably what we need to do is wrap this
28:22 - entire menu item in a link
28:34 - so let's try to wrap that I'm just going
28:36 - to try the first one just to see if it
28:39 - works oops keep going the wrong way uhuh
28:44 - oh I
28:47 - see didn't didn't get it all the first
28:52 - time okay
28:58 - all right let's try this now so we'll go
29:01 - we'll go to posters first and then I'll
29:03 - come back and click on the side there we
29:05 - go all right that works now so we need
29:07 - to change all these which it's kind of a
29:10 - pain but
29:14 - um not
29:16 - really let's see if I can change it all
29:19 - at once
29:42 - all right that makes it a little bit
29:45 - easier let's try
29:55 - this yeah this is going to be the tough
29:57 - part
29:59 - cuz they're all different
30:00 - lengths oh
30:02 - well helped a little bit
30:10 - whoa I don't know does anybody else uh
30:12 - ever play around with a multiple cursor
30:15 - thing and sometimes you just have weird
30:17 - things happen l i
30:20 - n uh occasionally that happens to me
30:22 - where I I'm not exactly sure if it'll
30:25 - work so I just try it anyway and it ends
30:27 - up just
30:30 - pasting stuff like every it just totally
30:34 - like it like just happened right it I it
30:37 - didn't work because these were different
30:38 - lengths so I couldn't copy the way I
30:40 - wanted to and then when I tried to copy
30:42 - one of them it copied all the lengths
30:44 - so not really a big deal all in all
30:47 - multiple cursors is way more
30:49 - helpful uh
30:53 - than then it is uh you know kind of a
30:57 - waste of time
30:59 - at times when it doesn't
31:00 - work all right so let me do these few
31:04 - things I know this is a bit boring but
31:07 - it'll be over in about 10 seconds or
31:15 - so now I think I have a few uh Vim users
31:19 - that that watch as well so I'm sure
31:22 - there's probably some super like magic
31:24 - Vim stuff that could have done that a
31:25 - lot faster because although I don't use
31:29 - them when I see people use it I'm always
31:31 - amazed at what can be
31:35 - done but now these should work so we'll
31:39 - give it a test just to make sure we did
31:40 - it correctly posters Share
31:43 - story
31:46 - awesome okay so that works
31:50 - great
31:52 - um so I'll leave that up so you can see
31:54 - what I was doing in case it was too fast
31:58 - and what were we trying to trying
32:04 - to have things styled a bit
32:12 - better yeah
32:15 - so basically I was surprised when I saw
32:18 - the default link style here because I
32:20 - had
32:22 - assumed obviously that links would go
32:24 - here so that the default would have been
32:27 - to
32:28 - override you know this link style this
32:31 - normal link style but it wasn't so I'm
32:33 - thinking maybe I needed to add something
32:35 - into the markup that was already built
32:38 - in to material
32:41 - UI uh I'm not sure
32:46 - but we'll we'll try it out if worse
32:49 - comes to worse we could always just add
32:50 - our own Styles it's not really a big
32:55 - deal so I'm not really seeing anything
32:58 - that stands out in the
33:00 - documentation I don't want to spend a
33:02 - ton of time digging into it uh the
33:07 - examples for the drawers aren't showing
33:14 - anything so they just have the regular
33:16 - menu items which is you know where we
33:18 - got this these examples from
33:36 - okay what potentially what could be
33:39 - happening as well and I didn't double
33:41 - check this but it's
33:44 - possible
33:45 - um on the last project I did when I was
33:48 - using the style jsx tag I noticed that
33:53 - at times depending on you know how I
33:56 - brought things in the Styles within that
33:59 - tag never got
34:00 - applied so potentially because this is a
34:04 - link tag and not an a
34:06 - tag uh at some point along the
34:09 - line uh the Styles try to get
34:13 - applied and and can't find the a tags
34:15 - that's basically what was happening
34:17 - before uh so I don't know how the styles
34:19 - are you know for these you know like for
34:23 - instance for the menu
34:26 - item um
34:28 - so maybe actually I wonder if they
34:35 - have looking to see if they had uh the
34:38 - menu item component in
34:43 - here but I don't see it let's
34:48 - see yeah they have some menus
34:52 - but it's uh like drop- down menus
35:02 - let's see they do use menu
35:12 - item but again I'm not seeing
35:17 - anything anything in here that's
35:23 - um that has a link on it
35:34 - oh
35:35 - well at the very least uh let's just get
35:38 - rid of these underlines so we don't have
35:40 - to look at them
35:46 - anymore so
35:53 - where's actually let me see there's some
35:56 - uh some stuff here in the live chat let
35:58 - me check it
36:04 - out uh Sabo says hi from Hungry how's it
36:09 - going thanks for
36:14 - watching hey Zanna how's it going glad
36:17 - you can join us
36:31 - uh Zanna ask what's with the blur I'm
36:33 - assuming you're talking about the video
36:34 - quality yeah it's because I'm at home my
36:37 - internet's not as good as at work so
36:39 - tomorrow I'll be back at work so it'll
36:41 - be uh good quality again tomorrow
37:03 - oh
37:15 - okay all right so uh Patrick
37:19 - has some uh advice about our issue right
37:23 - now with the the menu items and styling
37:25 - so says we could do uh menu item uh
37:30 - primary text and then within primary
37:32 - text
37:33 - put put what we want the text to be so
37:36 - let me let me try that out
37:53 - then all right and then in that case
37:58 - actually if this works I like this a lot
38:00 - better because then I don't even need
38:02 - that closing
38:04 - tag and that'll just look cleaner in
38:07 - general all right so we do that for
38:09 - Logos let's see how how it
38:14 - looks
38:16 - H still giving us that styling let me do
38:20 - a refresh just to be
38:22 - sure yeah it's still giving us that
38:25 - styling
38:39 - H oh actually I just so I finally found
38:42 - where the menu item properties are in
38:45 - the
38:46 - documentation so they're on the same
38:48 - page as the regular menus so on the on
38:51 - that sidebar in material UI underneath
38:54 - the menu selection if you scroll the
38:56 - bottom there there
38:59 - so let me check that
39:16 - out all right I mean I could just put a
39:19 - style tag in there it's not
39:25 - really let's see yeah I don't think it
39:28 - has
39:46 - anything yeah a few people are asking
39:50 - about the uh stream quality and live
39:52 - chat yeah sorry sorry my internet's bad
39:55 - today
40:08 - okay Sebastian says can use nav link
40:11 - instead of link so you can add an active
40:13 - class when you were on that
40:16 - routing Sebastian does so is
40:23 - navlink can I use that with uh react
40:26 - router then
40:46 - all right so
40:53 - let's I want to see actually want to see
40:56 - how this gets
41:15 - rendered okay I'm going to pull this
41:17 - over on the other screen here so you all
41:19 - can
41:23 - see oh actually I almost for got
41:28 - this I don't want to actually I don't I
41:30 - don't really want to try it on my
41:32 - network right now I'm afraid it'll make
41:34 - it even worse but uh
41:38 - so some of you may remember at one point
41:41 - I tried to use uh enro I don't really
41:45 - know how you say it but it's NG r o k uh
41:48 - so that you all could check out the site
41:50 - while
41:51 - I'm uh while I'm developing and we used
41:55 - it and it worked for like 5 seconds and
41:58 - then uh everybody tried to access the
42:00 - site and I hit the uh the
42:02 - limits um for the free
42:05 - plan well at some point um another um
42:12 - streamer I forget exactly how it came up
42:15 - but I told another streamer about what
42:17 - happened with enro on uh Twitter
42:22 - and I guess the guy who maintains en gr
42:26 - or you know made it
42:28 - saw it on Twitter responded asked what
42:30 - the problem was so I've been emailing
42:31 - back and forth with him and now I have
42:36 - basically it'll work I'll have I'll have
42:39 - enough
42:41 - um you know requ I don't know what level
42:44 - I'm at now but basically it should work
42:46 - for the stream it should be able to
42:48 - handle all the
42:50 - requests and um so I didn't have time to
42:54 - set that up this morning so I'll try to
42:55 - get everything set up
42:57 - um tomorrow because I would I I don't
43:00 - even have uh enro uh installed on this
43:03 - computer it's I have it on my work
43:05 - computer but anyway I'll get it working
43:07 - tomorrow and that should be cool because
43:09 - then everybody can can view I think
43:11 - Fabian was the one that had that idea
43:13 - which it was a really good idea and um
43:16 - anyway so that'll
43:19 - be uh tomorrow
43:30 - all
43:32 - right okay so Sebastian saying if I use
43:39 - navlink and so let me let me see again
43:43 - if I use
43:45 - navlink then I can add an active class
43:47 - when you're on that routing okay
43:53 - cool that won't be hard to switch
44:09 - n link
44:32 - okay I'm just going to check this just
44:34 - to make sure it still
44:36 - works yep still works
44:39 - awesome and
44:41 - then
44:50 - name so I can
44:53 - do so Sebastian's uh copying some stuff
44:58 - over into the um into the live chat for
45:02 - me to try
45:23 - out
45:25 - actually uh which one did I put that on
45:28 - was it
45:29 - logos yeah okay so I should have the
45:33 - class active on there
45:38 - now let's see yep class active Okay so
45:43 - anyway this is at one point I was trying
45:45 - to show you all how this is getting
45:48 - rendered uh and I I think I got
45:50 - sidetracked
45:53 - so we have see to do
46:00 - okay so this is the div that all the
46:02 - links are in so it all shows
46:17 - up that's OD
46:29 - okay for some
46:32 - reason home has active and logos have
46:38 - active I'm not really sure why that
46:43 - happened but anyway what I wanted to see
46:46 - was these styles to see that like yes
46:49 - this is the
46:53 - default and we don't want that
47:21 - okay let's
47:24 - um all right so here's
47:29 - here's what I haven't done yet in react
47:31 - and uh maybe uh some of you have done
47:34 - this uh can give me some advice here
47:37 - because I know this is possible
47:39 - so what I'd like to do is just have some
47:45 - standard
47:47 - CSS uh for
47:50 - links
47:53 - so I'm not always going to use the link
47:57 - tag so I don't want it to be on a
47:58 - specific component but just any time
48:01 - that a link is used so normally we'd put
48:05 - this in this app CSS which should
48:08 - probably be okay in this case because we
48:11 - could have links anywhere but I know
48:13 - that you can break up CSS and have it
48:17 - apply just to different components
48:22 - so I suppose I don't have to know it
48:24 - right now but it would be cool to know
48:27 - the best way to do
48:34 - that okay uh Dead zombie uh says F first
48:39 - time here uh hi Jesse I assum says I I
48:43 - love your stream but it uh anyway thanks
48:46 - for thanks for watching and uh again
48:50 - sorry about the
48:52 - quality I probably won't do as long of a
48:55 - stream uh just so that people who are
48:59 - watching now and watch the recording
49:01 - later don't have to suffer through too
49:02 - long of the stream I like am seriously
49:07 - thinking about moving just so I can get
49:09 - better internet
49:10 - because this is terrible if I ever went
49:13 - back to freelance I might move or like
49:16 - rent an office somewhere or something
49:20 - um because this is bad
49:27 - okay so let's just put some styling for
49:29 - an a tag
49:31 - here just to make
49:34 - sure I mean it looks like there's
49:36 - there's nothing that would be overriding
49:38 - anything so we should be fine to put the
49:40 - AAG styling here uh okay me like
49:48 - yeah yeah this is all
50:08 - basic okay Patrick says remove dead CSS
50:11 - W while I'm there good
50:14 - idea all right so what am I not
50:18 - using pretty much none of this
50:22 - right yeah
50:33 - oops okay
50:45 - cool have text
50:50 - decoration and
50:59 - color was the color off I can't even
51:04 - remember yeah we want
51:11 - to uh for
51:16 - now I'll just go black for now probably
51:19 - change it at some
51:21 - point okay cool we might have to
51:25 - do all all right
51:33 - awesome do want to
51:48 - see okay cool
52:04 - all right so at least we got rid of the
52:06 - annoying
52:09 - underlines and all these work and you
52:11 - can even click on the side and it still
52:14 - works so this is now operating like you
52:17 - would normally
52:19 - expect uh this side navigation drawer to
52:25 - operate cool all
52:29 - right I think this would be a good time
52:32 - to commit these changes so let me commit
52:37 - that I
52:41 - have I'm going to pull
52:43 - over
52:45 - my my
52:48 - terminal
52:49 - because I imagine there are some people
52:52 - watching that aren't familiar with the
52:55 - terminal so it's good I kind of like to
52:58 - just show when I do this
53:00 - though let me try to make it as big as
53:04 - possible there we go okay
53:07 - so um if you aren't familiar with
53:10 - terminal yours might not look like this
53:13 - uh there's some custom things going on
53:15 - here with the colors uh but basically
53:18 - the commands are all the
53:19 - same so I'm going to use get status just
53:22 - to see what we've changed we've changed
53:25 - app uh CSS and app.js so now we're going
53:28 - to do a get commit and I'm going to just
53:32 - do
53:34 - am and that means we're going to add the
53:37 - files uh while we're committing them and
53:40 - we're going to add a message as well
53:42 - right here uh in the
53:44 - command so the message is going to
53:47 - be
53:51 - um probably just pretty much style
53:54 - drawer links
53:58 - that's pretty much what we did I mean I
53:59 - know we uh we fixed the click thing
54:02 - too
54:10 - um DW there we dang it I can't type
54:18 - today all
54:23 - right drawer links
54:29 - that was
54:30 - terrible took me like four tries to
54:32 - spell
54:36 - drawer all right cool so you noticed we
54:39 - had it was taking a little bit of time
54:42 - that was all that stuff that we added
54:44 - with
54:45 - prettier um you know see husky was was
54:48 - running there so it was checking our
54:51 - files and changing so if we go back to
54:54 - our files they're most likely a bit
54:56 - different uh than how we left them so I
55:00 - don't remember exactly how we left them
55:01 - but if we would have been really lazy
55:04 - with our formatting it wouldn't have
55:06 - mattered because as soon as we commit
55:08 - everything gets formatted correctly uh
55:11 - according to whatever we said as our
55:13 - style rules which we're just using
55:15 - pretty much standard
55:17 - JS uh I I not even sure we altered it at
55:21 - all
55:24 - okay did I push that
55:27 - that uh and let me so I'm going to do a
55:29 - get push and this is going to make sure
55:31 - the code goes to our repository on
55:34 - GitHub and it's important to remember to
55:36 - do a get push because if somebody else
55:40 - is working on the project they won't
55:41 - know about your changes unless you push
55:43 - them or if you go to work on it from a
55:46 - different computer you won't have be
55:48 - able to get those changes unless you've
55:49 - pushed them up which I frequently work
55:51 - from two different computers
55:53 - so I pretty much I normally just push
55:57 - every time I commit that's not it's not
56:00 - 100% necessary but that way I I usually
56:04 - don't
56:07 - forget and we're
56:09 - pushing uh the master Branch right to
56:12 - into the master Branch so that's why we
56:15 - have Master otherwise whatever our
56:17 - Branch name was that we wanted to push
56:18 - to we would put it here instead of
56:21 - Master and now our changes are up on on
56:25 - GitHub and if you don't believe me you
56:27 - can check the
56:29 - repo the Link's in the
56:33 - description all right so let's check
56:36 - here again and let's see whatever the
56:38 - next thing is we're going to
56:40 - do um I guess we can work on the home
56:43 - view since this is functional and
56:46 - doesn't look
56:48 - terrible uh and you remember our home
56:50 - view is just going to
56:52 - have uh six six cards
56:59 - uh excuse me I was yawning uh six
57:02 - material design
57:04 - cards uh and basically on a on a large
57:07 - screen it'll be three and three and then
57:11 - it'll scale down uh it's like 2 two two
57:14 - and then all in a row on a very small
57:16 - screen like on a
57:18 - phone
57:20 - um and that's it that's pretty much all
57:22 - we had on the home screen before that's
57:25 - probably how we're going to keep
57:27 - it so we need to have some column
57:30 - classes and this is where I wanted to
57:33 - try to pull
57:35 - in the component
57:38 - from uh the newest version of material
57:43 - UI which we're not using right
57:48 - now so let
57:53 - me oops I had uh I hadn't I hadn't
57:57 - checked the um live chat in a while now
57:59 - I see uh Sebastian was was telling me to
58:03 - add in
58:10 - exact did I not have exact
58:16 - anymore let's
58:19 - see exact to the home routing
58:41 - so you're saying I need to add so uh
58:44 - Sebastian said I need to add exact to uh
58:47 - the home
58:51 - routing so I'm ass assuming this is what
58:54 - you're talking about exact so why um I'm
58:57 - not super familiar with react router I
59:00 - actually just learned about it a few
59:01 - weeks ago from the react course I was
59:04 - taking I'm still taking it uh so I was
59:07 - using it on my first project for that
59:10 - course so that's why I decided to use it
59:12 - for this
59:13 - project the two projects are actually
59:15 - pretty similar in terms of the setup
59:17 - they're both using Create react app and
59:19 - react
59:20 - router I set them both up with prettier
59:23 - and standard Js
59:35 - okay so um I guess that was the right
59:38 - spot so Sebastian why would what what
59:40 - does exact do on when I add it there uh
59:45 - to the um to the nav
59:52 - link I'm assuming now that that will
59:55 - solve the problem problem we had of home
59:57 - getting the active class as
60:01 - well I guess not let me
60:04 - refresh double
60:14 - check oh actually it should have it
60:16 - there because we're on the home view let
60:18 - me take me change
60:23 - that okay cool so that's what it fixed
60:27 - then
60:30 - right okay so
60:33 - um basically uh I'm
60:37 - I'm saying basically what Sebastian's
60:40 - saying in the live chat so you all know
60:42 - what's going on if you're watching this
60:44 - later on uh if if you don't put exact
60:48 - here then it'll try to match and put
60:53 - this uh this active class
60:57 - um
60:58 - on whatever
61:00 - matches so since we had a
61:03 - slash in the URL technically that
61:06 - matches this so by adding exact we're
61:10 - saying well it has to be just slash and
61:12 - nothing else so it it would have matched
61:15 - anything any of these
61:18 - links so that's why we did that and
61:21 - actually I've done that down here on the
61:23 - routes I just I didn't realize that that
61:26 - you could also do it on the
61:31 - links and actually
61:36 - so I'll probably need then to
61:40 - put that active class thing
61:45 - on
61:48 - everything yeah
62:19 - okay oh
62:22 - uh uh Timmy says hey have you shared the
62:26 - Trello todos yet actually no I haven't
62:30 - shared that or put the link anywhere
62:32 - just because I haven't put in any to-dos
62:35 - so I've been slacking on that uh I had
62:37 - thought about doing it this morning but
62:39 - instead I just started working on it uh
62:43 - so I'm going to I'm going to need to put
62:44 - them on there soon otherwise uh I'll
62:47 - start forgetting things and being a lot
62:50 - less
62:51 - organized so usually at the beginning of
62:53 - a project I I frequently just start
62:56 - working on it without doing all its
62:58 - todos and then once I get into it a
63:00 - little bit it's a lot easier for me to
63:02 - see all the steps you know and think
63:04 - about all the steps but right off the
63:06 - bat it's um I don't know why but I find
63:09 - it hard to break down
63:11 - everything uh it's just hard to think
63:13 - through all the steps when you're not
63:15 - seeing anything at all on the screen uh
63:18 - in terms of your project how it looks or
63:20 - the
63:21 - code uh but probably this week I'll need
63:24 - to lay out some steps
63:28 - here okay let's
63:32 - see should we
63:34 - add I'm sorry yawning again I didn't uh
63:38 - I didn't have any caffeine today at all
63:42 - uh which
63:43 - is which is rare I've been used to
63:47 - having uh either espresso in the morning
63:51 - uh or gfuel in the afternoon or
63:54 - sometimes both depending on how much
63:55 - sleep I got
63:58 - so um uh I should have had caffeine
64:01 - before the stream oh let me check the
64:03 - time here oh okay let me um I want to go
64:08 - to the live chat I totally forgot to do
64:10 - my um my
64:12 - normal Pomodoro uh stuff so I never
64:16 - really went back to the chat to check
64:18 - for questions and it's been an hour over
64:21 - an hour and I try to check every 25
64:23 - minutes so I'm going to go back to the
64:24 - chat I uh I'm thinking that I
64:28 - may I may wrap up the uh the video
64:32 - because basically we're at a point where
64:35 - we've accomplished like a chunk of work
64:36 - and that chunk was you know basically
64:40 - get the navigation drawer to a point
64:42 - where we want the only other thing I
64:44 - could think of doing right now is maybe
64:46 - adding that active style but I'm not
64:49 - 100% sure how I even want that to look
64:51 - right
64:52 - now
64:54 - so I think maybe this will be the end of
64:57 - the coding
65:00 - portion and
65:02 - then
65:05 - um I'll do all the questions and
65:07 - everything I'd like to wrap things up by
65:09 - maybe 3:30 so I'm it doesn't look like
65:12 - there's a lot of questions so I think
65:14 - that's definitely doable but I have to
65:16 - take my son to his karate class uh in
65:19 - about an hour or
65:22 - so uh so I'd like to be able to eat
65:25 - dinner before I do
65:26 - that and um I haven't he hasn't been to
65:30 - his class in like a month
65:33 - and some of that was us being on
65:35 - vacation and doing things on during his
65:37 - time but at least once it was due to me
65:41 - getting home from work a little bit late
65:42 - so I don't want to make him miss the
65:45 - class
65:47 - again uh all right so if you were just
65:49 - here for the code portion of it thank
65:51 - you so much for watching you can safely
65:54 - uh quit watching now if you don't want
65:56 - to be around for the uh Q&A if you have
65:59 - some questions or you'd like to stick
66:01 - around to help answer questions or you
66:03 - know hear the answers then uh feel free
66:05 - to stick
66:06 - around so if you have a question right
66:09 - now that you'd like for me to answer or
66:11 - anybody else in the chat to answer uh
66:13 - put it in the live chat uh or if you
66:16 - can't stick around you can still put
66:18 - your question in the comments to this
66:20 - video or you can um message me on
66:23 - Twitter or any other social media Med
66:25 - stuff that that I'm on and I'll get back
66:28 - to you as soon as I
66:30 - can and let
66:35 - me let me see uh what's in the live chat
66:42 - I think I covered all my normal uh stuff
66:45 - that I say at the end of the
66:47 - stream so I'm going to scroll all the
66:49 - way back to the top make sure I didn't
66:50 - miss anything I'm actually really
66:53 - surprised at how many viewers we still
66:54 - have cuz I know the quality is bad I'm
66:57 - really sorry about that uh so I'm I'm
67:00 - I'm impressed that you all were able to
67:02 - stick with
67:05 - it oh Nathaniel asked way at the
67:08 - beginning about uh streaming on weekends
67:10 - so yeah I've never streamed on a weekend
67:12 - I'm not entirely opposed to streaming on
67:14 - the weekends because I do work on
67:17 - occasionally I do work on things for my
67:20 - main job on the weekend if I have to uh
67:23 - hopefully I won't have to do that again
67:25 - for for a long time cuz I've I've done
67:27 - quite a bit of it recently uh but I work
67:30 - on on other projects on the weekend so I
67:33 - have my class my Udacity react course
67:35 - that I'm doing projects for
67:38 - which it would be cool to stream that
67:41 - although I wonder if I'm allowed to
67:42 - stream it since it's a paid course if
67:44 - they want like their project on there or
67:46 - not I guess it wouldn't be a big deal
67:48 - because the paid stuff is really paying
67:51 - for somebody to grade the project and
67:52 - give me feedback so I don't think it
67:55 - would be a big deal but I'd have to
67:56 - double check uh also I have some other
67:59 - just fun side projects so maybe I will
68:01 - stream on the weekend uh my oldest son
68:03 - really wants me to make a video game and
68:05 - he's already drawn everything that he
68:08 - wants me to do and like crayon on big
68:10 - pieces of paper he's drawn out the maps
68:12 - for like levels and uh all the bad guys
68:15 - and the good guys and all the weapons so
68:17 - maybe I'll do that I think it'd be cool
68:19 - to uh try to make a game in react I
68:22 - think it would help me build up my react
68:23 - skills and be fun
68:26 - and uh then maybe my son would get
68:29 - interested more interested in what I do
68:30 - and that would be cool
68:34 - too he's only eight years old he just
68:36 - turned eight over the weekend so I don't
68:38 - really expect him to be that into
68:53 - coding okay
69:01 - okay as I'm scrolling through I am I'm
69:03 - seeing like some more new people uh that
69:06 - are joining so uh
69:08 - welcome I appreciate you watching and
69:11 - joining in in the
69:20 - chat I didn't notice this before
69:22 - Nathaniel said earlier I wish Trello let
69:24 - you resize The Columns it triggers my
69:26 - OCD I'm working on my own list app to
69:29 - get around that taking a bit of time to
69:31 - code though oh that's really cool um if
69:34 - you get your app to the point where
69:35 - you'd like to share it uh I think that
69:37 - would be cool to to see it so send me uh
69:39 - send me a link to to the code or to a
69:41 - demo or something uh if you get a
69:50 - chance okay so Droid uh Dro pcgeek says
69:54 - I'm a web dev
69:56 - uh but I mostly work with JavaScript and
69:58 - a little bit of node.js because I
70:00 - program Discord Bots for fun that's
70:03 - really cool cool thanks uh thanks for
70:06 - sharing thanks for joining
70:10 - in I'd like to get into to learn how to
70:13 - program Bots preferably in JavaScript uh
70:16 - since that's what I'm most familiar with
70:25 - uh Isaiah asks how are you integrating
70:27 - material design with react uh and then
70:31 - um Maxime answers with material UI yeah
70:34 - that's it so material UI Vel says
70:37 - nothing so much great about material UI
70:41 - [Music]
70:46 - um yeah I I have no um
70:50 - particular I have nothing really to say
70:52 - about Mysterio UI yet because I don't
70:54 - feel that I've used it long enough to
70:56 - have uh an a really informed opinion
70:59 - about it so after this project I'm sure
71:01 - I I'll know what I think about
71:06 - it uh Sabo asks do you include the CSS
71:12 - into JS file or call it with a separate
71:15 - reference let me bring up where I have
71:18 - that so the
71:22 - um the CSS currently
71:28 - is actually I I have two CS so I have an
71:31 - index CSS file that gets included in the
71:34 - index and that's just this all right
71:37 - some basic stuff here and then we have
71:38 - an app CSS file and that gets included
71:42 - up here uh in the app file so that's
71:45 - where we put the the link um really
71:49 - I I don't really know why there needs
71:53 - really to be two different files to be
71:54 - honest with with you this is just how it
71:57 - came like automatically from create
71:59 - react
72:00 - app uh because I'm
72:05 - not it's not like there's a separate
72:08 - component other than apps like
72:10 - everything's flowing through app into
72:12 - index so it probably could everything
72:14 - could probably be in this index CSS if
72:17 - we really wanted it to apply everywhere
72:19 - maybe there is some like performance
72:21 - reason why you would want to split them
72:23 - up and not have a lot in here I don't
72:25 - really know but basically that's the way
72:27 - we're we're importing
72:29 - them uh at you know at the top of our uh
72:33 - react
72:34 - components and we could split it up as
72:36 - much as we want so each component could
72:37 - have its own separate CSS file uh which
72:40 - may end up happening some components
72:42 - probably won't need their own CSS uh if
72:45 - they're not really doing a lot uh UI
72:47 - wise so uh we'll see but we may may end
72:51 - up having having it uh like that
73:04 - Nathaniel says if I stay up till 3:00 am
73:06 - then wake up at 8 am I generally feel
73:08 - sick that day and can't code properly
73:10 - yeah so I've done that
73:13 - before uh actually my uh my kids wake up
73:17 - at night frequently and the baby wakes
73:20 - up really early in the morning so if I
73:22 - stay up late the odds of me having to
73:24 - wake up at like 5 5 or 6 in the morning
73:26 - with the baby are pretty high it seems
73:28 - like it always happens like that if I go
73:30 - to sleep early the baby sleeps in too uh
73:34 - and then I get a lot of sleep which is
73:36 - great but uh if I stay up late for some
73:40 - reason I think the baby senses that and
73:42 - then wakes up at 5 o'clock in the
73:44 - morning and wants me
73:46 - so my solution to that is espresso and
73:50 - g-fuel those are the days when I have
73:52 - both uh and then I can't fall asleep
73:54 - that night even though I'm exhausted
73:58 - so does anybody else have trouble
74:00 - falling asleep even though you're tired
74:02 - at night that's been happening to me a
74:04 - lot lately I know I'm tired I know I
74:06 - should sleep but I just can't sleep I
74:09 - just
74:12 - um I don't know last night was okay I
74:15 - was so exhausted I was able to fall
74:17 - asleep but it had been after days of not
74:19 - getting enough sleep
74:38 - all right so I'm just scrolling through
74:39 - the live chat a bit more I'm about
74:41 - halfway through
74:44 - now uh Nathaniel asks what packages do
74:47 - you use on adom um I have a lot of
74:51 - packages I'll bring up my um my settings
74:54 - right now and just let you see the
74:56 - packages I'm not going to go through all
74:57 - of them I did that once on a video I
75:00 - can't remember what video it was though
75:02 - uh that's one of the video ideas that I
75:06 - have like you know to do some
75:08 - pre-recorded short videos on my own
75:10 - channel uh I have a list of ideas a lot
75:13 - of them have come from you all but one
75:14 - of them on the list is go through all my
75:17 - packages and how I set up um my my
75:21 - editor how I set up Adam and then maybe
75:23 - even how I set up Visual Studio code as
75:26 - well I don't have nearly as a much set
75:29 - up for visual studio code but I do have
75:32 - some so anyway this is I'll make this a
75:36 - bit bigger oh I
75:38 - can't I tried to uh command plus and
75:42 - make it bigger and it did not work so
75:45 - I'll just scroll through this as I'm
75:48 - talking uh and that way you can see a
75:50 - little bit of what I'm
75:52 - using some of these I I don't ever
75:55 - really
75:56 - use I know I've downloaded things before
75:59 - that I thought sounded cool and then
76:01 - didn't use them that
76:08 - much uh ysep
76:12 - says using dual screen is good for eye
76:16 - protection but they shouldn't
76:18 - be in the same Dimension at least one
76:22 - should be closer than the other that's
76:24 - interesting i' never heard that
76:28 - um that's cool I have to keep that in
76:31 - mind now that I think about it uh I
76:35 - guess I do have them at different
76:37 - dimensions most of the time just because
76:39 - the way my desk is set
76:40 - up so I wasn't doing that on purpose
76:43 - because I had no idea there was any
76:44 - advantage to doing that but I'll have to
76:46 - remember that
76:48 - now I used to have a four monitor setup
76:51 - and every monitor was at a different
76:54 - height
76:55 - and everyone was at a dist different
76:58 - distance from me and it wasn't on
77:00 - purpose it was just I didn't have proper
77:02 - mounts for the monitors they were all
77:04 - different sizes because I would just
77:06 - like grab monitors when I could get them
77:08 - like for free if somebody was getting a
77:10 - new one they just let me have their old
77:11 - one and then I just had them standing on
77:13 - whatever I could find around the house
77:15 - to put them on so it was an oddl look
77:18 - setup but it worked
77:39 - uh mobin said disable caching and chrome
77:41 - Dev tools just to be sure I usually have
77:43 - caching disabled uh every time Dev tools
77:46 - is open uh just by
77:49 - default oh fine if if you're a web
77:52 - developer which you probably I'm
77:54 - assuming most people watching this are I
77:55 - recommend doing that because I mean if
77:59 - you're spending most of your time on the
78:01 - internet developing you're going to have
78:03 - Dev tools open and you're probably not
78:05 - going to want the cash to work because
78:07 - you want to change something and see
78:08 - what happens immediately so I just leave
78:11 - it leave the cash off when Dev tools is
78:14 - open all the
78:16 - time uh because I I've never had a case
78:19 - where I wanted to cash a site that I was
78:21 - working on
78:53 - shirt actually see
78:55 - Nathaniel says just get a digital ocean
78:57 - VPS and save it to it in real time so
79:00 - this is when we're talking about using
79:03 - enrs uh it says pay them like $40 a
79:05 - month for highend VPS and you'll never
79:07 - have a problem again yeah I think I'll
79:09 - just go with enro since uh it's been
79:12 - generously given for
79:15 - free
79:18 - so not not really uh excited
79:22 - to pay $40 and
79:25 - month if I don't have
79:28 - to oh Nathaniel says I can get 32 CPUs
79:31 - for 640 a month that's more than I pay
79:34 - for my house
79:49 - payment oh mobin says you can compress
79:51 - the stream uh with pi Piper oh I've
79:55 - never heard about that I'll have to look
79:56 - that
80:08 - up okay Patrick says that he's gotten
80:11 - SAS working in the his uh latest react
80:14 - project that's awesome uh I actually I'd
80:19 - really like to know how how you got it
80:21 - working CU I would love to use SAS as
80:24 - well for my project so um if you get a
80:28 - chance you know send me a message or
80:30 - something or let me know comment
80:32 - depending on how difficult it was you
80:34 - probably just comment on the video and
80:39 - um uh that would that would be really
80:42 - awesome
80:44 - [Music]
81:23 - okay
81:27 - [Music]
81:30 - uh
81:33 - see oh Barto says that he was yawning
81:37 - right before I did hope he didn't send
81:39 - it to
81:40 - you then again with the delay yeah there
81:43 - is a delay on the stream so maybe we
81:45 - yawned at the exact same time didn't
81:47 - even realize
81:53 - it uh uh Daniel said how did he do that
81:57 - super copy and paste so I'm yeah I'm
82:00 - guessing that you meant like my
82:04 - um my multiple cursors
82:08 - so let me demonstrate that because that
82:11 - is a really cool thing to do so if
82:13 - you're using adom or pretty much every
82:16 - code editor has this I don't know if the
82:18 - hot keys are always the same to do it
82:21 - but basically I can highlight so I'm
82:23 - going to highlight nav link here and
82:25 - then I'm going to press on my my Mac
82:27 - using atom I'm going to press command
82:30 - and then D and I'm going to hold in
82:32 - command and every time I press D while
82:34 - still holding in command it highlights
82:37 - that same word that that same string
82:40 - that you have highlighted in the next
82:42 - spot that it appears in and then you can
82:44 - edit it so right now I'm just moving the
82:47 - error keys back and forth and you'll
82:49 - edit everything and if I were to paste
82:52 - whatever I last copied it would paste in
82:54 - every POS position if I were to
82:56 - highlight it
82:57 - and um cut it it would cut that
83:01 - out so it's really really handy it's
83:05 - it's kind of
83:07 - like if you don't have enough things
83:09 - that you really need to use find and
83:11 - replace like it would be a pain to try
83:13 - to do a find and replace then these
83:16 - multiple curses make a lot of sense once
83:18 - you'd have a lot of items then finding
83:22 - replace is probably the way to go and
83:23 - it's it's more power
83:25 - powerful but especially like if all the
83:27 - items you need pretty much fit like
83:30 - within the screen so you can see what's
83:32 - going
83:33 - on uh then that's that's when it's most
83:35 - useful so anyway I'm really glad you
83:38 - asked that question actually because if
83:40 - there was anyone out there anyone else
83:42 - out there that didn't know about it uh
83:44 - really helpful I actually I heard about
83:46 - it first I saw it first on uh will
83:50 - Stern's uh YouTube channel it's um learn
83:53 - code academy
83:54 - and it was one of his videos I think he
83:56 - was actually using Sublime Text when he
83:59 - did it uh but I remember seeing him do
84:02 - that and thinking like what what is this
84:05 - awesome thing and
84:07 - um yeah ever since then I I use it a lot
84:11 - one it's one of my favorite
84:18 - things uh Sebastian asks uh quick quick
84:22 - update of what you've done so far I saw
84:23 - you merge my my uh pool request yeah so
84:26 - I I did I merged your pool request that
84:28 - was awesome thank you uh thank you for
84:30 - that uh basically the only other things
84:33 - that I've done is I added in react
84:34 - router I added all these you these links
84:37 - and uh the routes down here that you see
84:40 - and I didn't do all this during the the
84:43 - the stream I did it beforehand and then
84:46 - I um I added
84:48 - prettier uh to Auto format so uh with
84:52 - you know standard Js so just like we had
84:55 - set up on the last project that's pretty
84:57 - much
85:06 - it uh Hamza asks react native when is it
85:10 - coming is it coming yeah react native is
85:12 - coming I can't say when though for sure
85:15 - uh so I'm doing a course right now and
85:17 - the last part of the course it is about
85:20 - react native so uh within a few months I
85:23 - will have built something with with
85:24 - react
85:25 - native and um at that point I would
85:29 - really like to try to build something
85:32 - for work for my main job with react
85:35 - native this project I'm working on right
85:38 - now might not be a bad candidate for
85:40 - that
85:43 - so I
85:45 - may maybe I'll come back to this project
85:48 - I just don't really think I'll be able
85:50 - to learn enough about react native to to
85:52 - do this project with it but this might
85:54 - be a good candidate to come back to uh
85:57 - and and try it because it's pretty
85:59 - simple it' probably be easy to to you
86:02 - know convert it I I just I haven't used
86:04 - react native yet so I just don't really
86:06 - know how much more difficult it would be
86:09 - sorry for the noise I think my kids are
86:11 - throwing uh things down the laundry
86:13 - shoot so the laundry shoot comes out
86:16 - right behind me
86:28 - uh sad asks about being a complete web
86:33 - developer uh as a
86:35 - beginner um yeah I would you start out
86:38 - with HTML and CSS uh than
86:41 - JavaScript and you know free code cams
86:43 - course is really
86:45 - good uh you could try
86:49 - um uh free code
86:52 - academy no that's not what it is it's
86:55 - just code academy learn code academy is
86:57 - a video series all right but I would say
86:59 - start out with
87:01 - um uh with free code
87:04 - camp and that's I mean that's a really
87:07 - good place to start
87:17 - out de zombie asked as a beginner front
87:20 - end Dev what should I learn first I
87:21 - already have a great knowledge of HTML
87:23 - and CSS I'm learning JS at the moment so
87:26 - any
87:31 - opinions
87:36 - um I don't know I mean I would say if
87:39 - you're already learning
87:41 - JavaScript it kind of depends on exactly
87:43 - what kind of stuff you want to work on
87:46 - but
87:48 - um all right that's
87:51 - my I'm sure you all can hear that my
87:53 - three-year-old is just
87:55 - like making a lot of noise right now
88:01 - so all right so I'm not sure
88:06 - why hey hey
88:11 - guys okay I'm on YouTube right now so I
88:15 - need you all to be a little bit more
88:16 - quiet okay okay all right thank
88:22 - you uh
88:26 - hey that doesn't sound quiet to
88:30 - me so um anyway sorry about that uh so
88:35 - anyway as a beginner like if you're
88:36 - already good with HTML CSS you're into
88:40 - JS um I I kind of think learning react
88:45 - is is a good way I mean I know I'm I'm
88:47 - using rect already so maybe I'm a little
88:50 - bit biased towards it but for me I've
88:54 - I've learned so much more about just
88:57 - vanilla JavaScript by learning react
89:01 - than than I ever had before also I will
89:03 - say since I started doing the live
89:05 - streams I've learned more than I ever
89:06 - had before from you know everything that
89:09 - you all share with me during this the
89:10 - chat uh
89:13 - and uh from the pool requests and stuff
89:15 - that I get so that that helps as well uh
89:18 - but that's that's I mean if you're
89:20 - looking for you know somewhere to some
89:23 - goal you know
89:24 - because there's a lot of stuff you could
89:25 - learn I would I would go that
89:33 - way uh Hamza says and Redux have you
89:36 - done a video with Redux I haven't done a
89:38 - video with Redux yet I don't really know
89:40 - a lot about Redux so maybe it's
89:44 - coming I think Redux I think I will also
89:48 - learn Redux in the course that I'm
89:50 - taking I'm not 100% sure but I think
89:52 - that was on like the course outline so
89:56 - uh once I cover that if I feel I need to
89:59 - work that into a
90:01 - project then I will and we can cover
90:03 - that as well um SJ asks about vue.js I
90:08 - have not tried vuejs yet I've just kind
90:10 - of heard a little bit about it uh
90:13 - haven't used it yet I might use it at
90:15 - some point uh but I don't really have a
90:18 - plan to use it uh right
90:22 - now uh saw ask do you uh use PHP and
90:27 - HTML in your project in this project
90:30 - yeah I mean I use HTML I mean I pretty
90:33 - much use HTML in every
90:35 - project uh in this particular project
90:37 - I'm not using PHP in the last project
90:40 - that that we did and that I streamed I
90:43 - did use
90:45 - PHP I made a a custom WordPress plugin
90:48 - for that project so
90:51 - um so occasionally I have used it on
90:54 - some of my projects but I won't be on
90:56 - this particular project I might use it
90:58 - again on a future project
91:03 - though uh Enix core says and I'm late
91:07 - again good day
91:08 - everyone well glad you could join us for
91:11 - for the end
91:12 - here you can always catch the
91:18 - recording uh Blake asks or Blake says
91:21 - I've been using Adam text editor and
91:23 - it's been really laggy I haven't messed
91:26 - with at with it at all so there's
91:28 - nothing extra any ideas to speed it up
91:32 - h i you know what I don't really
91:36 - know I guess if um if you haven't really
91:40 - added anything to it and it's still like
91:42 - that I don't know of ways to make it
91:44 - faster there may be some ways out there
91:47 - um Sebastian recommends uh Visual Studio
91:50 - code and I would probably give you the
91:52 - same thing I Visual Studio code seems to
91:54 - be way faster than Atom from my
91:56 - experience but I wasn't comparing fresh
92:00 - installs of each one so I I didn't know
92:04 - exactly because my atom has so many
92:07 - plugins and things so I'm not 100%
92:12 - sure you know just how much faster they
92:15 - are but I have noticed a definit speed
92:19 - difference and visual studio code is
92:21 - very similar to atom it's free uh it's
92:24 - developed by
92:25 - Microsoft um so I've been I've been
92:28 - pretty impressed with it so far you can
92:30 - actually set Visual Studio code to use
92:32 - the same key Bindings that atom does so
92:34 - if you're used to those you can switch
92:37 - over and just go in the settings and uh
92:39 - vs code set it to your atom key bindings
92:42 - and then you won't even have to learn
92:44 - any new um any new shortcuts uh you know
92:47 - on your keyboard so that was pretty
92:48 - convenient
92:55 - Dana says all right so in in regard to
92:58 - um I think I got to the point in the
93:00 - chat where I was talking about not
93:02 - sleeping uh Zanna says um working in the
93:08 - garden uh really helps it improved my
93:11 - sleep a
93:12 - lot yeah I'll have you know what that
93:15 - makes a lot of sense because um I used
93:18 - to have a better routine of like doing
93:21 - workouts and since I was was doing so
93:24 - much work you know so much coding
93:28 - recently I just that that kind of got
93:31 - pushed to the side so there's just you
93:33 - know obviously there's not enough time
93:34 - in the day so something had to be cut
93:36 - out for me to be able to work that much
93:38 - and that's what got cut
93:39 - out
93:41 - so probably like you know I sit around
93:44 - all day and I code and mentally I'm
93:46 - getting fatigued but my body is getting
93:48 - nothing so uh yeah maybe I need to do
93:51 - some something physical
93:55 - Daniel says get flux for your computer
93:57 - the blue light from your computer keeps
93:58 - you awake it lowers serotonin levels
94:01 - yeah actually that's a good idea I have
94:03 - flux installed on my PC but I don't have
94:05 - anything like that on my Mac
94:09 - so uh I guess I I'll have to do that I
94:13 - do have my phone set to switch uh when
94:16 - it gets
94:18 - late but you know it actually and the
94:20 - the nights when it's been hardest to
94:21 - sleep I've been up late um building my
94:25 - um my app for the the course that I'm
94:28 - taking so that makes a lot of sense
94:31 - Maxim says meditate to sleep better yeah
94:34 - actually that helps I mean I'm
94:38 - uh I'm Catholic so uh sometimes I'll
94:41 - like pray the rosary which
94:43 - is somewhat of a type of meditation and
94:46 - that usually helps me go to
94:49 - sleep uh Sarah
94:51 - says yep I use melat
94:54 - yeah actually I have tried melatonin
94:56 - before uh I'll have to use that if I
94:58 - really can't sleep I don't like to use
95:01 - it a lot
95:02 - cuz it doesn't leave me really groggy
95:05 - but it's definitely like I can tell the
95:07 - difference to when I I take melatonin
95:09 - when I differ when I don't in terms of
95:11 - like how rested I feel uh so it's not as
95:15 - bad as like you know a sleeping
95:18 - pill
95:21 - um but I don't like to use it too much
95:25 - yeah occasionally my kids give my kids
95:29 - melatonin
95:31 - uh they actually really like it they ask
95:34 - for melatonin all the time I don't
95:35 - always give it to them
95:37 - but they like that they be able to
95:39 - follow sleep quickly uh sod says uh
95:43 - Jesse understand coding and when we make
95:46 - some mistake in our code I was stuck
95:49 - sometimes all the night I was doing free
95:51 - code can't practice till it really makes
95:53 - me strong in HTML CSS and now I moved
95:56 - into
95:58 - JavaScript um cool yeah it's good once
96:02 - you get into the JavaScript part of free
96:03 - code Camp it does get a lot harder um so
96:08 - there will be sometimes where you know
96:10 - you got to spend a lot of time on some
96:12 - of the algorithms and things but you
96:15 - know keep working at it you know you'll
96:16 - get there sometimes you got to like take
96:18 - a little break and then you know when
96:21 - you come back to it the solution seems
96:24 - like it's it's just a lot more
96:40 - obvious uh John says John Hansen says
96:43 - will those JS files and Views become
96:46 - separate HTML uh final public web page
96:49 - files okay so what's going to happen
96:51 - here is
96:55 - all these files here in
96:58 - views we'll put in these routes so
97:01 - instead of the H1 tag we'll just have a
97:03 - tag you know based on that component so
97:05 - it'll just say like glossery right or in
97:07 - this case it'll be home so it'll be
97:09 - home.js here so we'll render
97:14 - home.js and there'll be a separate file
97:16 - so we'll go into the home.js file and
97:18 - here's where we'll put all our markup
97:20 - for that page and then it'll render to
97:24 - the user it will seem like a separate
97:26 - page it'll have a different URL but in
97:28 - reality it's not entirely a separate
97:30 - page because we're not rendering the
97:32 - whole screen so there's still this whole
97:34 - menu system and nav at the top that will
97:38 - stay the same and never have to
97:40 - render uh
97:42 - so it's kind of nicer like it definitely
97:45 - keeps the appearance of separate pages
97:48 - but it's not really a whole page which
97:50 - is why I call them views instead of page
97:52 - it's not like I make up the term that's
97:55 - everybody uses the term views I guess
97:57 - but uh I think it's more accurate to say
97:59 - a view than a page because it's not
98:01 - traditionally a page like normally as in
98:05 - sending a request to the server and
98:06 - getting an entire page
98:08 - back so anyway let me know John if that
98:12 - uh answered your question or
98:17 - not Zanna
98:21 - says love and Fusion if you can accept
98:24 - the taste one teaspoon of dry lavand in
98:28 - a glass of water you put it in the
98:32 - morning and leave it till evening you
98:33 - drink it before going to sleep I've
98:36 - never heard about that that's really
98:44 - interesting all right so sorry I can't
98:47 - pronounce someone is asking a question
98:48 - here and the uh the characters are not
98:51 - the normal alphabet that I'm used to so
98:53 - I can't pronounced that sorry
98:56 - um I guess it's it's Russian uh it says
98:59 - why why does people prefer create react
99:02 - app if you can't even configure webpack
99:04 - or something similar for your own needs
99:06 - you just have to follow react scripts
99:08 - workflow yeah so create react app is
99:10 - just really nice to get started if you
99:13 - just want to start working on something
99:15 - because you can get started in just a
99:16 - you know a few minutes and have
99:18 - something that works so you do sacrifice
99:21 - customization for that so it's just a
99:24 - tradeoff that sometimes makes sense and
99:26 - sometimes doesn't for this particular
99:28 - project uh we may not have to do any
99:31 - customizations so it should work uh but
99:35 - for some projects you would need to so
99:38 - it just depends on what you're doing so
99:40 - if you don't need to customize this
99:41 - saves you a lot of time you can also
99:44 - eject this and then do all the
99:46 - customizations that you want so it's
99:49 - good to start it's nice you can start a
99:51 - project like this and if the project
99:52 - ends up becoming more complicated than
99:54 - you thought it would be and you need to
99:56 - customize you can always do that later
100:13 - on uh Nathaniel says will the video
100:16 - replay be in full HD or still blurry
100:18 - actually the video replay will still be
100:20 - in uh lower quality which which really
100:23 - stinks
100:24 - that's I that's why I really don't like
100:27 - to have to do streams from
100:29 - home uh I maybe could record the video
100:33 - while I'm streaming it with OBS and then
100:35 - upload it later that would be a huge
100:38 - file size
100:40 - though I'll have to think about that and
100:44 - see because I'm pretty sure you can do
100:46 - that with
100:48 - OBS so what would happen I guess is that
100:50 - I would actually just
100:53 - maybe take down the video for the stream
100:58 - and then instead upload the
101:00 - video that might work I'll think about
101:02 - doing that next
101:04 - time assuming that I have enough space
101:06 - on my hard drive to handle the huge file
101:09 - that ends up uh being made from the
101:13 - stream I'll have to keep the stream
101:14 - short Maybe
101:30 - oh
101:32 - okay um I didn't realize so uh mobin had
101:38 - said something about using pi Piper for
101:40 - something and I didn't get the reference
101:43 - and uh Rahul says it's a it's a
101:45 - reference from a TV show not an actual
101:47 - product so thanks for letting me know I
101:50 - would have tried to look it up I I mean
101:52 - I probably would have eventually figured
101:53 - out it was from a show but thanks they
101:55 - said it's from Silicon Valley TV show so
101:58 - I've never seen that I want to see it uh
102:00 - I just haven't watched it
102:06 - yet okay cool so uh Patrick followed up
102:09 - about using
102:11 - SAS uh and it
102:15 - says it's it's in to it is about using
102:19 - it with create react app cool
102:25 - awesome I have to check that out thank
102:37 - you uh R rishab asks is there any way of
102:42 - using the CSS grid system just like
102:43 - bootstrap I don't I don't know how I can
102:46 - make a react app responsive yeah uh you
102:49 - can use any uh system you want like any
102:52 - CSS system with react you know just you
102:55 - just plug the CSS in so it would
102:59 - work
103:01 - um I'm actually G to try to have a
103:05 - responsive grid with this site by using
103:08 - the newest version of material UI so uh
103:11 - if you watch maybe some of the the
103:13 - episodes coming up this week I'll
103:15 - probably try to get it working this week
103:18 - and um so it won't be with bootstrap but
103:22 - it will be a grid
103:36 - system uh Patrick asked about the
103:38 - shortcut to skip to the next instance of
103:41 - text uh for multiple
103:45 - cursors
103:49 - um I guess what it command d
103:58 - oh to to skip the next instance I don't
104:01 - know the skip I've never used the
104:02 - command to skip but that would be really
104:05 - useful but I've never taken the time to
104:07 - learn it I've always figured there there
104:09 - was
104:17 - one all right Jordan says hi hey Jordan
104:20 - thanks for watching
104:35 - Alonso says hi on my break at my coding
104:38 - boot camp cool well thanks for uh thanks
104:41 - for watching I hope everything's going
104:43 - well at at the coding boot
104:45 - camp also Alonso how did you get your
104:48 - name to show up like that that's really
104:50 - cool so I mean you anyone watching the
104:53 - video can't see this unless you're in
104:55 - the live chat but Alfonso's name in the
104:57 - live everybody else's name is all just
104:59 - the normal gray and the normal font
105:01 - Alonso has
105:03 - like uh wow it says he's a moderator
105:07 - okay is that why you're moderator how
105:10 - did you get to be a
105:12 - moderator
105:13 - anyway I was just amazed that he has a
105:16 - different color name
105:34 - now I can I can I get I get to the part
105:37 - in the chat where um where my kids were
105:39 - making all that noise so thanks thanks
105:42 - for being such good sports about it
105:44 - everyone
106:03 - thanks uh Zanna says my kids sound too
106:07 - cute thanks they said Maxi just so cute
106:11 - yeah they're cute they're really cute
106:13 - that's I think
106:15 - um the kids like it's really good that
106:18 - kids are so cute because if like if you
106:22 - have kids or been around kids before you
106:23 - know sometimes they're just crazy and
106:25 - they just do things that don't make any
106:28 - sense but they're so cute you don't stay
106:31 - super mad at them right like otherwise
106:35 - it would be really hard to take care of
106:37 - kids but it makes it so much nicer that
106:39 - they're so cute like when I have to wake
106:42 - up really early in the morning with the
106:44 - baby like she smiles at me and laughs
106:48 - and it's like okay I feel like I'm going
106:50 - to die cuz I'm so tired but it's still
106:53 - fun because I get to you know I get to
106:55 - see her for a while before work
106:58 - so so that's cool I
107:03 - think I think it's it's definitely the
107:07 - cuteness has its its
107:14 - purpose oh cool Sebastian says yes uh
107:18 - nine-year-old twin brothers so cool
107:24 - Santa says you should invite them over
107:26 - when you were at work too yeah they've
107:28 - they've come into where I work before
107:30 - and
107:31 - um it usually is like the same thing
107:34 - it's me saying okay let's try to be
107:43 - quiet uh V says hello everyone uh Hey V
107:48 - thanks for joining us
107:58 - Blake says six brothers and
108:02 - sisters
108:04 - awesome that's really cool
108:24 - okay so marrow says why not use switch
108:26 - in router then don't use exact in
108:30 - route uh well why I I guess I could use
108:34 - that the reason why is simply being I
108:36 - had no idea that switch existed so
108:38 - thanks for bringing that up I'll have to
108:39 - check it out now like I said I said a
108:41 - little bit
108:42 - earlier um I just literally just learned
108:46 - how to use react router a couple weeks
108:48 - ago and I haven't worked with it very
108:50 - much just in my side project for my
108:52 - course which I don't get to work on very
108:55 - much so um yeah so there's a lot of
108:58 - stuff I'm sure about react router that I
109:01 - don't even know is possible so I'll have
109:03 - to check that out thank you for
109:14 - that Sebastian says wow Chrome eating
109:17 - all my Ram yeah it does that
109:19 - occasionally does
109:27 - oh okay Nathaniel says you don't need to
109:28 - use flux on Mac so flux was the thing
109:31 - that we were talking about that would
109:32 - automatically make you know dim your
109:35 - screen and you know shift the light so
109:36 - that it would um it wouldn't keep you
109:39 - awake at night as much so evidently Mac
109:42 - has night shift built in and so you can
109:46 - just uh enable night shift so oh cool
109:49 - that's good to know I'll have to do that
110:03 - okay Zanna says and this is uh back to
110:06 - what we're talking about with you know
110:07 - sleeping and you know getting good
110:09 - exercise and so that I can be able to
110:12 - sleep and uh she says uh both me and my
110:15 - boyfriend are writing code we have a big
110:17 - garden and we make sure we work out as
110:18 - well that's cool yeah I think that is
110:21 - probably important I usually never have
110:22 - trouble sleeping if I get a good you
110:26 - know workout in during the day although
110:29 - sometimes if I work out at night it
110:30 - wakes me up and I can't go to sleep so I
110:32 - have to make sure I get it in earlier in
110:35 - the day if I work out in the morning I
110:37 - actually am really
110:39 - awake right after the workout so it's
110:41 - kind of nice it's like better than than
110:51 - coffee uh okay I see Hamza uh mentioned
110:55 - night shift as well for
111:01 - Mac Blake says PC versus MAC for coding
111:05 - um I don't know I used both um lately
111:09 - I've been using a Mac a lot so I'm I'm
111:11 - kind of partial to a Mac for coding PC
111:14 - is always going to win I think when it
111:16 - comes to gaming but uh but the Mac it
111:21 - could just be that my Mac is just a
111:23 - better computer than my PC in terms of
111:25 - how much RAM it has and things but uh my
111:29 - Mac just seems so much faster than my PC
111:33 - and my PC has a desktop it has a decent
111:35 - amount of ram a nice video card like it
111:37 - should run well uh but it just doesn't
111:41 - compete with with a Mac it seems like I
111:44 - click something on my Mac and it
111:45 - immediately happens on the PC like I
111:49 - have to wait for everything so maybe if
111:52 - I had a PC with with enough RAM you know
111:56 - maybe it would be better uh
111:59 - but I don't know I like I I like using
112:02 - the Mac now I don't like that they cost
112:04 - so much money but uh I do like that they
112:09 - they function really
112:15 - well wow Sebastian said just saw an
112:18 - article claiming that Firefox uh version
112:20 - 56 can open about 1,600 tabs in 15
112:26 - seconds that's
112:29 - amazing I mean why would you want to do
112:31 - that but that is
112:34 - amazing wow Nathaniel says melatonin
112:37 - gave gave him a ton of vivid
112:40 - nightmares that's it's never happened to
112:43 - me when I've taken melatonin that's
112:45 - crazy I didn't even know you could have
112:48 - uh an a reaction like that to melison

115:13 - yeah that's true that honestly all I use
115:15 - my PC for anymore is gaming I don't game
115:19 - that much but I just bought my son uh my
115:22 - eight-year-old I I bought in Minecraft
115:24 - for his birthday so he's been using my
115:28 - PC that used to be what I developed on
115:31 - and now he's been using it for
115:33 - Minecraft which that game is really cool
115:35 - I never played it before and uh it's
115:38 - super addictive so I need to like watch
115:40 - out so I don't play Minecraft all day
115:43 - and not get anything done
115:57 - uh Nathaniel says benad is good for
115:59 - sleeping take two of them you fall

116:27 - now all right so let's say command
116:31 - k
116:36 - d
116:40 - cool ha check that out look it skipped
116:43 - that so I skipped these two sections and
116:45 - then skipped down to skip this one kept
116:48 - going that's awesome
116:58 - okay one says same uh one works works in
117:01 - Ubuntu Ubuntu but then uh uses windows
117:05 - for
117:18 - gaming Hamza said in Pakistan they make
117:22 - fun of people who have a lot of kids and
117:23 - not a lot of time uh yeah in the in the
117:27 - United States actually um it's it's
117:30 - weird like uh big families sometimes get
117:34 - uh like a lot of like negativity people
117:37 - I don't know why people get freaked out
117:39 - by big families uh I'm in a unique Place
117:42 - uh where I live uh in Stubenville Ohio
117:45 - in the United States there's actually a
117:47 - lot of big families like way more than
117:50 - in most parts of the country so it's not
117:53 - really like I have a family of four in a
117:55 - lot of places a family of four is seen
117:57 - as a above average size family but
118:00 - around here it's not seen as a big
118:03 - family at all because uh you know my my
118:07 - children's friends uh from school they
118:10 - have six seven eight there's some
118:12 - families that have 12 kids uh so like
118:17 - six kids would be more of an average
118:18 - sized family around here like eight is
118:21 - getting kind of big and then above that
118:23 - is a big family so it's kind of a weird
118:25 - a weird spot I'm sure it's different in
118:27 - different different parts of the world
118:29 - uh
118:31 - but yeah
118:35 - um I always said uh when people ask me
118:39 - how many kids I wanted to have I would
118:40 - say I'd like to have a football team but
118:43 - I'll settle for a baseball
118:46 - team and they always looked at me like I
118:49 - was crazy I thought it was funny but
118:51 - they thought it was
118:55 - nuts oh James says uh in Utah there are
118:58 - a lot of big families as well
119:03 - cool yeah like I said I I like big
119:05 - familyes I think that's that's
119:09 - cool all right I think I'm GNA wrap it
119:12 - up the stream's going on oh yeah it's
