00:00 - variables
00:02 - a variable is a container for a value
00:04 - the value can be many things such as a
00:06 - number or a string like part of a
00:08 - sentence or it can be an object or a
00:11 - complex function with variables the
00:13 - value in the container can change to use
00:16 - a variable you first have to declare it
00:21 - there that variable has now been created
00:24 - or declared you're going to create a
00:26 - variable using the var keyword the const
00:30 - keyword or the let keyword
00:33 - now before es6 you could just use var so
00:36 - that's still the most common but those
00:38 - other keywords are available
00:41 - after creating the variable you must
00:43 - initialize the variable this is where
00:45 - you just give it a value this is done
00:47 - with the equal sign
00:55 - there we just initialized my name
00:57 - variable with the name bo it's a string
01:00 - you can also declare and initialize a
01:03 - variable all at once
01:10 - so we declared the variable state and we
01:12 - initialized it as michigan
01:14 - you can use variables all over the place
01:16 - in javascript
01:20 - so here if you want to console.log
01:22 - you're just going to put something into
01:24 - the console over here so i'm going to
01:26 - put my name
01:28 - is
01:29 - use a string here and then i'm going to
01:31 - add a variable that's also a string
01:37 - and we're going to run that so we can
01:38 - see it right in the console it's going
01:40 - to do my name is bo see there's no space
01:43 - between isn't bo because you have to put
01:45 - a space here
01:47 - now once a variable has had a value
01:50 - assigned to it you can update that value
01:52 - by just simply giving it a different
01:53 - value so i'm going to put state
01:56 - equals
01:58 - california
02:00 - so before state equaled michigan and now
02:03 - state equals california so if we console
02:05 - that log it or do anything else like
02:06 - that it's going to equal california
02:09 - there are certain naming rules and
02:10 - conventions for variables
02:12 - generally you should just stick to using
02:14 - latin characters like 0 through 9 or a
02:18 - to z
02:19 - or even
02:20 - capital a to z
02:22 - and you should not use underscores at
02:25 - the start of variable names
02:27 - while this is allowed it has certain
02:29 - meanings and could get confusing so
02:31 - don't use the underscore to start
02:33 - numbers at the start of the variable
02:34 - will cause an error so you can't have a
02:36 - variable that starts with a number it
02:38 - can have a number in it just not at the
02:39 - beginning
02:40 - a safe convention to stick to is the
02:43 - lower camel case so this is just the
02:46 - naming convention see what says my name
02:47 - up here that's the lower camel keys when
02:49 - you stick multiple words together
02:52 - you should do it without a space and you
02:54 - should capitalize every word after the
02:56 - first word
02:57 - so if we're gonna have a longer variable
03:05 - so that's lower camelcase there's no
03:06 - spaces capitalize each word
03:10 - just like
03:11 - the name of free codecamp is in lower
03:13 - camel case
03:14 - you should always make variable names
03:16 - intuitive so they describe the data they
03:18 - contain
03:19 - also this is very important variables
03:21 - are case sensitive so a capital letter
03:23 - and a lowercase letter are completely
03:25 - different
03:26 - lastly you should not use javascript
03:29 - reserved words as your variable names
03:31 - this means words that make up the actual
03:33 - syntax of javascript such as var
03:36 - function if else for
03:39 - and one final thing about variables
03:42 - javascript is a loosely typed language
03:45 - which means that unlike some other
03:46 - languages you don't need to specify what
03:48 - data type a variable will contain such
03:51 - as number or string
03:53 - or object or anything like that
03:55 - javascript just figures it out for you
03:58 - well that's variables thanks for
04:00 - watching my name is beau carnes don't
04:02 - forget to subscribe and remember use
04:04 - your code for good
