00:00 - hey everybody this is quincy with free
00:02 - code camp i've had a lot of requests
00:04 - from a lot of code campers to show
00:07 - how i use gmail as you may have heard i
00:10 - use gmail maybe 5 or 10 minutes a day
00:12 - but during that period of time i read
00:14 - all kinds of emails and respond
00:16 - and the key
00:18 - is using keyboard shortcuts that save so
00:20 - much time
00:21 - so let's take a look at some of the
00:22 - shortcuts i'm going to teach you real
00:24 - quick
00:24 - so
00:26 - basically navigating around gmail
00:28 - opening replying replying to all the
00:30 - emails forwarding composing
00:32 - and archiving and even marking spam
00:35 - we're going to learn all that real quick
00:37 - so the first thing you want to do is go
00:39 - to gmail this is just a kind of spam
00:42 - email account that i use and you'll want
00:44 - to go to settings
00:47 - and you'll want to find keyboard
00:48 - shortcuts and you'll want to make sure
00:50 - the keyboard shortcuts are on
00:53 - and then you want to save
00:55 - so after you do that you can go back to
00:57 - the inbox view and this is my main view
01:00 - i don't
01:01 - actually use a lot of folders or any of
01:03 - the advanced gmail
01:04 - functionality i literally just use the
01:06 - inbox and my actual inbox is inbox zero
01:10 - i always have a completely empty and
01:13 - anything that i can't deal with
01:15 - immediately well i figure out some way
01:17 - to get it back into the court of another
01:19 - person or i set up a reminder to take
01:21 - action in the future but specifically in
01:24 - the realm of hotkeys i'm going to teach
01:26 - you immediately something very useful
01:28 - j will move this blue cursor here
01:32 - down
01:34 - and k will move it back up
01:36 - it's a fundamental concept that you
01:38 - should grasp in using these gmail
01:41 - shortcuts
01:42 - another thing you should know oh will
01:44 - open an email
01:46 - so
01:46 - as you can see i've got this original
01:49 - email it's just a
01:51 - email here i can click on it to open it
01:54 - up i can click it to close it but i can
01:56 - also
01:57 - use n
01:59 - to move to the next one and p to move to
02:02 - the previous one i can just hit enter to
02:04 - expand it if i want
02:05 - so n
02:06 - is next p is previous
02:10 - okay so let's go back to
02:13 - the
02:14 - um inbox here
02:16 - and
02:18 - i'm going to show you if i open it up i
02:20 - can hit j to shift through all the
02:23 - different emails i have in my inbox and
02:25 - i can hit k
02:26 - to move back and when i get to the very
02:28 - top and i hit k the final time it just
02:30 - takes me right back to the inbox so i
02:32 - can go really deep and come right back
02:34 - up into the inbox
02:36 - next thing i want to show you
02:38 - is how to compose emails you hit c and
02:41 - you can compose an email
02:43 - and you can
02:44 - just hit tab to skip through the fields
02:46 - let's say you wanted to send an email to
02:48 - somebody
02:53 - you can just tab down here you just hit
02:55 - tab and it'll lock in that email address
02:57 - and you can type your next email address
02:59 - tab down here test
03:01 - test hit tab again and you see that it
03:04 - highlights send
03:06 - and you just hit enter and it's sent
03:09 - so now
03:10 - let's go ahead and reply to an email so
03:14 - i've got this email i'm just going to
03:15 - hit r to reply to it i can hit escape at
03:19 - any point to exit out of this text box
03:21 - that i'm in and get access to these
03:24 - hotkeys again and let's do that so i'm
03:26 - going to hit escape and i'm going to hit
03:28 - a and i'm going to reply to all this
03:30 - particular email only has one sender so
03:32 - it's not any different from replying
03:35 - um the other thing i could do is i can
03:36 - hit escape to exit out of this and
03:38 - instead of replying i can hit f to
03:40 - forward it
03:41 - i can forward it
03:42 - to an email address and you'll notice
03:44 - how i just typed team and hit tab there
03:46 - and it auto completed the rest
03:49 - so tab is
03:50 - gmail has something called tab
03:52 - completion you can hit tab to complete
03:54 - email addresses then i can just hit tab
03:56 - and
03:57 - send a little message and then hit tab
03:59 - again and hit enter to send it
04:01 - so then after i've done all this stuff
04:03 - i can either hit j
04:06 - to go all the way back up to the top
04:09 - or k to go all the way back to the top
04:12 - or i can archive it but before we start
04:15 - archiving things because this is pretty
04:17 - critical
04:19 - you can hit x to select the currently
04:21 - selected
04:22 - email
04:24 - and it'll add this little check to this
04:26 - box here so what you can do is you can
04:28 - just hit j x j x j x and you can just
04:32 - select a ton of stuff and then you can
04:33 - hit e to archive it and that's what i do
04:36 - i don't actually
04:37 - create folders or anything i just
04:38 - archive things and that's how i get to
04:40 - zero inbox
04:43 - archive stuff
04:46 - the other thing i wanted to show you is
04:47 - you can hit
04:50 - if you hit x
04:51 - you can just hit
04:52 - exclamation point and it'll mark it as
04:55 - spam now i don't actually want to mark
04:57 - this as spam so i can just undo that
04:59 - with z
05:01 - so regardless of how deep you get
05:02 - yourself in you can always hit z to undo
05:04 - it so that's how i use gmail and gmail
05:07 - is a wonderful tool you don't need some
05:09 - powerful email app if you just know a
05:12 - few shortcuts and if you just go through
05:14 - really quickly and archive things you
05:17 - don't want and
05:18 - last thing is a goody
05:20 - little uh grab bag item if you hit slash
05:23 - it'll select the text box so you can
05:25 - just start typing
05:27 - let's just search test and we'll find
05:29 - the previous emails i sent with tests as
05:31 - the subject and the contents
05:33 - so that's how i use gmail
05:36 - thanks for watching
