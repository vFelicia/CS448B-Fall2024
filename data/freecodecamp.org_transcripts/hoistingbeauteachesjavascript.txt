00:00 - hoisting variable declarations and
00:02 - function declarations are processed
00:04 - before any code is executed so declaring
00:06 - a variable or function anywhere in the
00:07 - code is equivalent to declaring it at
00:09 - the top this also means that a variable
00:11 - and functions can appear to be used
00:13 - before they're declared this behavior is
00:15 - called hoisting as it appears that the
00:17 - Declaration is moved to the top variable
00:19 - definitions are when you assign a value
00:21 - to a variable these are not hoisted to
00:23 - the top let's look at some examples if
00:25 - you look over here we have console.log
00:28 - not declared if I take out this comment
00:32 - and I run this you're not going to see
00:33 - anything in the console because this
00:34 - console does not show errors and this is
00:36 - giving an error because the this
00:39 - variable is not used anywhere in the
00:41 - program but if I take out the comment
00:43 - for this one consult dolog defined later
00:46 - so show it shows undefined because this
00:50 - variable has has been hoisted up see
00:52 - it's not declared until right here this
00:55 - is when it's declared but it's defined
00:59 - right here here since it's declared
01:01 - right here to the program that's the
01:03 - same as it being right above it um the
01:05 - so the the Declarations are always moved
01:07 - to the top so it still knows that
01:09 - defined later exists but it's not
01:11 - defined till down here so it's undefined
01:14 - but if I take the comment off of this
01:16 - code and run it you'll see at the it's
01:18 - going to say I am defined so then we get
01:21 - to this next console.log which um was
01:24 - already not commented out and it said
01:26 - defined simultaneously so where we're
01:30 - declaring the variable and defining it
01:33 - so the Declaration the VAR defined
01:35 - simultaneously that gets hoisted to the
01:37 - top but the definition which is equals I
01:41 - am defined is not hoisted to the top so
01:45 - that's why when you run this you look at
01:46 - the bottom it's undefined because it has
01:49 - been declared but has not been defined
01:53 - so I take out
01:58 - this and now we got we have undefined
02:02 - and then I am defined so this is the
02:05 - undefined this is the I am
02:07 - defined let's clear that and if we go to
02:10 - the next one so if we call this function
02:12 - do something else but the the function
02:15 - is actually not declared until after the
02:19 - function call let's see what happens it
02:22 - says I did it that comes from this
02:24 - function I did it so functions are also
02:26 - hoisted to the top so it's just like
02:27 - this function is at the top before you
02:30 - call it now down here we have something
02:32 - that's similar but a little different so
02:35 - we have a
02:37 - variable that's declared here but then
02:40 - it's assigned to a a function so the
02:45 - variable will be the variable declared
02:47 - declaration will be at the top but the
02:48 - assignment to the function will be after
02:50 - the function call so if we do that um
02:53 - it's not going to show anything after I
02:54 - did it it's actually going to give an
02:55 - error and the errors aren't showing in
02:56 - this console view but it's going to get
02:57 - get an uncaught type error function VAR
02:59 - is not not a function because function
03:01 - VAR has been declared but it's
03:04 - undefined to make things easier to read
03:06 - you should declare all your variables at
03:08 - the top of your function scope so it is
03:09 - clear which which scope the variables
03:11 - are coming from Define your variables
03:13 - before you need to use them but Define
03:15 - your functions at the bottom of your
03:17 - scope to keep them out of the way thanks
