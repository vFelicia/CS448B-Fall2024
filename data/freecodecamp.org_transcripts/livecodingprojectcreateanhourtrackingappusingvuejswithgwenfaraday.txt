02:40 - hi everyone
02:41 - welcome to free code camp
02:43 - and another vue.js stream
02:46 - if you don't know me my name is gwen and
02:48 - i run the faraday academy youtube
02:51 - channel that you can check out from the
02:53 - description below i do mostly django and
02:56 - vjs content and a few other things
03:00 - sprinkled in there
03:02 - um
03:02 - yeah so if you are a member of this chat
03:06 - you can go ahead and
03:09 - comment or make any suggestions as we're
03:11 - going along
03:13 - this is the repo
03:15 - that we'll be working off of today
03:19 - it's basically under my github which is
03:21 - gwen f
03:22 - uh view nwjs hours tracking and this is
03:25 - also linked in the description below
03:29 - um so it has
03:31 - uh different
03:33 - yeah all the different information
03:35 - requirements uh tech stack
03:38 - so it's going to be another vue.js
03:40 - application the only difference between
03:43 - this and the other apps i've been
03:44 - building
03:45 - hi anish how are you
03:47 - it's good to see you
03:50 - is that it'll be using nwjs which is a
03:53 - desktop application framework
03:56 - that uses node.js
03:58 - and chromium
04:00 - and then i'll be using um actually not
04:03 - mongodb but i'm going to look for the
04:05 - same style of database i think
04:08 - because nwjs has some similar options
04:12 - for that
04:12 - hi sassy how are you
04:15 - it's good to see you again
04:17 - um yeah and then just bootstrap
04:20 - for
04:21 - the design library so i don't have to
04:23 - design it myself
04:25 - here are the
04:27 - or here is the schema
04:30 - that i made just a basic
04:32 - first go at it
04:34 - um
04:36 - yeah and then i do have some mock-ups
04:39 - so these are the different pages for
04:42 - both the mvp and version one
04:46 - and then i just pick some colors
04:49 - before the stream
04:52 - yeah and so this is the road map what i
04:54 - want to add first and then
04:56 - what i want to add second and then i can
04:58 - add more and more things after that
05:03 - so this is probably
05:05 - where is it so hours log will be the
05:08 - first one just a plain table and then
05:10 - i'll make it more fancy from that
05:12 - as well as being able to add
05:15 - new hours into the log
05:18 - so this should be a fun project now if
05:21 - you've used um
05:24 - electron before then there are a lot of
05:27 - similarities because it's
05:30 - it's i mean it's still building a
05:31 - desktop app in javascript you can do a
05:34 - lot of the same things there are some
05:36 - pros and cons to both of them
05:38 - but i'm going to be using like i said
05:40 - before nwjs
05:42 - for this project so you can go to
05:43 - nwjs.io
05:47 - and
05:48 - the documentation is decent for this
05:51 - project and there are some good examples
05:54 - online especially with vjs that i found
05:57 - so here's the getting started
06:00 - um you'll notice there are some
06:04 - differences let me see if i can find it
06:08 - yeah so you have this
06:10 - uh so for global objects like you have
06:13 - in um
06:15 - when you're developing in the browser
06:16 - you have the document object which is
06:19 - actually also
06:20 - polyfilled
06:21 - in nwjs
06:25 - and you have
06:26 - this nw global object so you can use
06:29 - nw.window
06:32 - yeah and some other things like that
06:35 - so
06:37 - um yeah you can do
06:38 - document.body.ad event listener so you
06:41 - can use all of your regular front-end
06:43 - stuff and then you also have access to
06:45 - the operating system too so you can
06:47 - access the operating system information
06:50 - file system all kinds of stuff like that
06:52 - hi techstack
06:54 - glad you're here again
06:57 - um yes i think that's all i wanted to
06:59 - say about nwjs
07:02 - it's an interesting project actually
07:04 - with a lot of new updates coming soon
07:08 - um
07:08 - it's also been around a long time so
07:10 - it's very robust
07:12 - and
07:13 - i found this or someone showed me this
07:15 - where which one is it it's this one
07:19 - so
07:20 - this uh
07:21 - nw view cli example
07:24 - so it's it's basically
07:26 - like
07:27 - um
07:28 - you know when you when you use the vcli
07:30 - use view create and it sets up a basic
07:32 - project for you this is the same thing
07:34 - except it sets up
07:36 - a basic nws and view project for us so
07:38 - i'm going to go ahead and use this
07:40 - boilerplate here and i'll post a link to
07:43 - this in the chat
07:45 - so
07:46 - i'll call it view
07:48 - nwjs
07:52 - uh
07:55 - wait boilerplate
07:59 - okay
08:01 - and
08:03 - yeah so there are
08:06 - some instructions it basically
08:08 - you know gives you a boilerplate desktop
08:11 - window these are all the technologies it
08:14 - uses it it's not opinionated about a
08:16 - design framework so we're just going to
08:17 - pull in bootstrap
08:19 - and it gives you instructions how to
08:22 - install packages start locally that's
08:24 - all the same and then it gives you a
08:25 - whole bunch of other commands that have
08:27 - to do with building desktop apps for
08:29 - different os's and that kind of stuff
08:32 - so i'm going to go ahead and clone this
08:33 - repository
08:37 - as a starter
08:39 - so
08:40 - oh let me
08:41 - copy it
08:45 - and go to my terminal
08:47 - in this folder so i'm going to do git
08:49 - clone
08:51 - nw
08:52 - if see vcli example
08:54 - except i'm going to call it
08:57 - nwjs
09:00 - hour tracking
09:06 - okay and now
09:09 - zoom in a little
09:11 - okay so i have that folder now i'm gonna
09:14 - go into the folder
09:16 - and
09:18 - i'm gonna install the dependencies which
09:20 - will take a minute
09:22 - so npm install
09:24 - and kind of wait for that
09:27 - so i know not everyone can chat right
09:29 - now but for those of you
09:32 - who can chat
09:34 - how's it going
09:37 - any comments about desktop apps vue.js
09:41 - life right now
09:48 - okay it's not going too slowly that's
09:50 - good
09:56 - okay and then right after i install this
09:59 - i'm going to go ahead and install
10:00 - bootstrap so i don't have to stop the
10:02 - server again later
10:05 - so bootstrap view
10:08 - let me zoom in again
10:11 - let me go to the docs
10:16 - and getting started
10:20 - actually i should have checked my node
10:22 - version before i installed everything
10:24 - there
10:25 - i'll have to check it after i think i'm
10:27 - using 12
10:30 - which is lts
10:32 - because i use mv nvm so i switch between
10:35 - versions sometimes
10:39 - okay
10:40 - so
10:46 - let's see
10:48 - all right so npm install i need to
10:51 - install bootstrap view and bootstrap it
10:54 - also has view here but i already have
10:57 - view installed with the project so
10:59 - that's it hi tom how are you
11:01 - it's good to see you again
11:03 - npm install bootstrap view and bootstrap
11:07 - so
11:08 - just waiting for this to finish
11:11 - installing
11:13 - and that should just take another second
11:19 - come on
11:23 - and then i'll install bootstrap
11:25 - and then later on i'm gonna go ahead and
11:29 - make the view components
11:31 - and the view application and then later
11:34 - on i will need to add a database for
11:36 - this so
11:37 - not sure i'll get that get to that in
11:39 - this stream so i might start off next
11:41 - stream
11:42 - hopefully adding the database then
11:50 - i'm doing well i'm happy to still be
11:52 - streaming this should be
11:54 - a fun project because it's a bit larger
11:57 - than
11:58 - the other projects which were just kind
12:00 - of one-off one-stream projects
12:05 - can you brief a little yeah sure i i
12:08 - will um brief a little bit more as soon
12:12 - as we open up the actual files which i
12:15 - guess i can do that now
12:18 - and
12:21 - let me just start installing
12:25 - what was it bootstrap
12:28 - bootstrap view
12:30 - and bootstrap
12:32 - need to install those
12:35 - hi jared
12:38 - i'm glad you are here
12:40 - so this is this is kind of cool because
12:42 - jared is
12:44 - in nwjs and also a view expert
12:47 - who
12:48 - contributed to the nwjs project
12:52 - so he knows a lot about this project
12:56 - so welcome to the chat jared welcome to
12:58 - free code camp
13:02 - all right
13:05 - um
13:06 - okay well while this is waiting
13:09 - let's take a look at this project
13:11 - so if you
13:12 - just take a brief oh let me zoom in
13:16 - zoom in twice okay so if you just
13:18 - briefly look at this this looks almost
13:19 - exactly like a regular vue.js project
13:25 - with the exception of probably this file
13:28 - so it has a server.js file
13:32 - with express so basic express server
13:36 - you should be able to do
13:38 - view add whatever
13:41 - oh for um
13:43 - vcli plugins
13:45 - yeah i don't know if i need any plugins
13:48 - right now but i'll definitely keep that
13:50 - in mind
13:52 - okay so the package.json
13:56 - of course we have all of our regular
13:59 - view and static files here but i'm going
14:01 - to go into the package.json right now
14:04 - and so
14:05 - there's a lot of stuff going on
14:10 - so
14:11 - you have
14:12 - a lot of the same objects of course it's
14:14 - a regular package.json so here are all
14:16 - the scripts
14:18 - some of them are regular like
14:23 - testing
14:24 - running testing and linting all of these
14:27 - build scripts are for building for
14:30 - different operating systems so you have
14:33 - windows
14:34 - linux
14:36 - is there a mac one
14:38 - um
14:40 - oh maybe oh the linux one
14:43 - no build nw that must be mac
14:45 - maybe i haven't actually built an into
14:47 - vgs
14:50 - um
14:51 - are we at max
14:53 - 720p so i'm streaming in
14:56 - 720p
14:59 - and
14:59 - from the preview i get i can see it in
15:02 - 720p so hopefully you can see it if you
15:05 - can't see it
15:06 - in that quality then try changing it in
15:08 - the youtube settings because i've had to
15:11 - do that sometimes
15:13 - when i'm watching someone's stream
15:15 - and it's low quality you can probably
15:18 - change it in the youtube settings
15:19 - hopefully
15:20 - um
15:22 - yeah so the only commands that or the
15:24 - only command i'm going to be running
15:26 - today is actually the start command
15:28 - and
15:30 - you can see it runs these two commands
15:32 - concurrently at the same time so it runs
15:34 - npm run serve
15:36 - which is the regular view cli service
15:39 - command that you get from abuse ucli
15:44 - and then
15:46 - this nw
15:48 - command so it runs the nwjs
15:51 - desktop server so it can open the actual
15:53 - desktop app
15:57 - okay and then some specific things so
15:59 - there's specific configuration in here
16:02 - just for
16:03 - desktop applications
16:06 - and i'm going to go ahead and open
16:08 - the window but
16:11 - you can see it has this metadata
16:14 - about nwjs
16:16 - so you can choose the height the width
16:19 - min height width icon and a whole bunch
16:21 - of other things
16:23 - for the i think this is the manifest of
16:26 - nw
16:28 - no for the desktop app that you're
16:29 - building
16:31 - so when i open this
16:34 - clear now let me run
16:35 - [Music]
16:39 - npm
16:42 - start
16:43 - to start the development server
16:46 - and this should open
16:48 - the
16:49 - desktop app as well
16:59 - okay
17:00 - there's a lot of stuff
17:02 - going on okay now it's running
17:05 - uh
17:06 - and
17:07 - the port don't need to worry about the
17:09 - port because
17:10 - it should have opened here
17:14 - hmm
17:16 - oh there it goes there it goes
17:20 - okay so this is the boiler plate and you
17:22 - can see the window size
17:24 - actually comes from the size denoted
17:27 - here
17:28 - um
17:29 - and then this is also
17:32 - resizable so
17:34 - i can do it this is built on chromium
17:37 - but you don't actually have to
17:40 - have a chrome browser installed to run
17:43 - it because it has it built into nwjs
17:46 - um
17:47 - yeah and then it just runs it and you
17:49 - can also you also have access so this is
17:52 - a shortcut link
17:53 - that
17:54 - the
17:56 - people who made this boilerplate
18:01 - built in but this is just a link to open
18:03 - the developer tools so that i can use
18:05 - developer tools while i'm building this
18:07 - desktop app
18:09 - so that's not any different than
18:10 - electron or any other
18:12 - desktop application hi bobby welcome to
18:15 - free code camp
18:17 - how are you
18:19 - um
18:21 - okay so
18:23 - okay now i have
18:25 - the basic page for nwjs
18:29 - and actually
18:31 - so let me
18:33 - let me maximize the browser
18:38 - okay cool it has view dev tools
18:41 - built into this template i'm using
18:43 - that's great i didn't even know that
18:46 - okay
18:47 - um so there is actually one thing that i
18:50 - forgot i would have to do here and if
18:52 - you look at the mock-ups oh wait it's
18:54 - this way um if you look at the mock-ups
18:56 - i have in the repo which if you just
18:59 - joined the repo is linked in the
19:01 - description below
19:02 - that i'm going to be working off of
19:04 - and
19:07 - um
19:09 - need to do that
19:12 - so you can see it has these different
19:14 - pages and it has a draw menu here
19:17 - without links to different pages so i'm
19:19 - going to need to install view router
19:21 - to route between the different pages in
19:24 - the application
19:26 - and so i will be using the cli plugin
19:29 - for that
19:30 - and
19:32 - let me just look it up real quick so i
19:34 - get the right
19:36 - name for the package
19:39 - uh view router
19:46 - so
19:48 - um
19:49 - getting let me go to getting started
19:56 - because
20:00 - okay oh installation this is the one
20:03 - let me zoom in one more
20:07 - okay so it shows
20:09 - via script tag via npm
20:12 - and view cli so i'll do view add view
20:15 - router
20:17 - just peachy awesome
20:19 - so jared says if you do view ui
20:23 - and add your project then you oh yeah so
20:27 - vue cli has a ui interface
20:30 - where i can add
20:33 - dependencies from there if you haven't
20:35 - seen it it's really awesome so i think
20:37 - i'll just do that
20:39 - so let me do view ui
20:44 - because i want to also add
20:48 - the
20:50 - uh or i want to add state management as
20:52 - well with vue x
20:55 - okay so let me see if it opened
20:57 - yeah it did
20:58 - so this is the view ui
21:01 - and
21:01 - there's
21:02 - a server running and serving this ui
21:04 - interface and now if i go to plugins
21:09 - i can
21:10 - see these plugins are the plugins that
21:12 - are already installed that came with the
21:15 - boiler plate
21:16 - and
21:20 - oh no i'm i was like how did this one
21:23 - get there uh let me zoom in
21:25 - so actually
21:26 - these aren't the ones that came with the
21:28 - boilerplate i have to
21:30 - um
21:33 - oh wait i have to zoom out i want to get
21:39 - there we go i need to open up the right
21:42 - folder so
21:46 - let's look at
21:48 - [Music]
21:49 - yeah i think view project manager
21:55 - and
21:57 - projects import
21:59 - so i have to go into projects and then i
22:02 - have
22:04 - a lot of stuff in here
22:06 - so i have nw
22:09 - nws
22:11 - so uh
22:12 - nwjs hour tracking this is the one
22:16 - okay and this is my view project so i'm
22:18 - going to import this folder
22:24 - okay now i can correctly see
22:28 - oh click the home button oh yeah that
22:31 - would have been a shortcut thanks
22:34 - um
22:34 - okay so
22:36 - now i can go to plugins
22:40 - and i can correctly see the plugins that
22:42 - are installed with this project
22:44 - and oh great so there are links here let
22:48 - me zoom in
22:51 - if you can see there are shortcut links
22:53 - to add
22:55 - these common plugins i didn't even know
22:57 - they had this
22:58 - yeah
22:59 - so
23:01 - add view router i'm going to click this
23:04 - it's suggesting it to me
23:06 - it says official library to support
23:08 - multiple virtual pages in a single page
23:10 - app
23:11 - okay continue
23:14 - so it's installing view router and then
23:16 - after this i'm going to install vuex
23:22 - this is exciting getting to build
23:25 - and if i actually build this desktop app
23:28 - it'll be my first one
23:29 - ever
23:30 - building and distributing to systems
23:34 - while this is uh installing
23:36 - actually so the idea for this app came
23:38 - from my consulting because
23:41 - if you watched so on my channel i have a
23:43 - video about consulting where i just talk
23:46 - about some of the things i've learned
23:47 - over the years
23:48 - and
23:50 - so this app it's actually what i do
23:54 - like keep an hours log
23:56 - for each different project my next tasks
23:59 - list
24:00 - all of this stuff
24:03 - that i do for myself but i do it all
24:05 - manually and so someone suggested
24:07 - that i make a desktop app for it and i
24:10 - was like oh that's a great idea
24:12 - um because that would save me so much
24:15 - time especially where is it where is it
24:17 - uh
24:19 - where's the page
24:22 - especially oh i must not have included
24:25 - it
24:26 - oh but there's a
24:28 - a page for
24:30 - exporting so i can export
24:34 - as in a csv or i can export an invoice
24:38 - and i can basically
24:40 - give an hour log to the client because i
24:42 - always give the client a breakdown of
24:45 - what i did
24:46 - on which days
24:48 - and then i also of course i have to send
24:51 - them an invoice to get paid so if i
24:52 - could generate those things in kind of a
24:55 - simple desktop interface without
24:58 - you know all the complicated software
25:00 - for it out there
25:02 - this would be kind of a cool thing to
25:03 - have
25:05 - um okay
25:07 - so
25:08 - where is it oh that's probably done now
25:10 - let me check on that install
25:15 - oh where is it yeah
25:18 - um
25:20 - successfully so at the bottom in tiny
25:23 - tiny words it says successfully invoked
25:25 - generator for plugin
25:28 - view cli plugin router okay now let me
25:32 - add view x then
25:34 - for state management
25:37 - because there's going to be quite a few
25:39 - pages and components
25:41 - yeah and there's no reason to not use
25:43 - view x for a multi-page view application
25:47 - in my opinion anyway maybe some of you
25:49 - have a different opinion
25:54 - all right so that's installing i have
25:58 - bootstrap i have
26:00 - the vcli tools once this is done
26:03 - installing i'll start setting up the
26:05 - pages one by one
26:09 - and the first thing i'll set up
26:12 - is
26:15 - i guess a top bar
26:16 - with
26:17 - um
26:19 - with a navigation draw
26:22 - so let me see what it's called in
26:25 - bootstrap
26:26 - if it's called an app bar or a toolbar
26:32 - does anyone know what it's called i know
26:33 - the chat legs like hopefully it's not
26:36 - much more than
26:38 - five to eight seconds
26:42 - um
26:43 - okay
26:45 - let me just look at components
26:47 - oh they added new components
26:49 - wonderful
26:51 - um
26:56 - let's see navbar
26:59 - that makes sense oh yeah right it's
27:01 - bootstrap's nav nav bar thing
27:06 - let's see
27:10 - navs navigation is available in
27:12 - bootstrap
27:13 - uh share general markup and styles from
27:16 - the base b nav class to the active and
27:18 - disabled states okay
27:20 - so this is a basic nav bar
27:24 - and you can change the appearance of the
27:26 - links if i want tabs i will want tabs
27:28 - for something later on but not yet
27:33 - so the only thing i really want in the
27:35 - nav bar
27:37 - or the two things is really a link
27:40 - oh no no it's a button to open
27:43 - the draw menu and then
27:45 - i want the logo or the title the name of
27:48 - the app basically and that's it
27:58 - okay so i think i can work with this
28:03 - oh pills so pills will make it look
28:06 - like
28:07 - a button
28:10 - um
28:12 - no because that will make whichever
28:13 - one's active look like a button so yeah
28:17 - i'll probably just copy the basic one
28:20 - for this
28:25 - okay
28:27 - yeah there's a lot of stuff here okay
28:30 - i'm gonna get rid of that
28:32 - and now let me check on the install
28:35 - okay that's installed let me refresh
28:37 - this page because it's not showing those
28:39 - two new yeah so once i've refreshed
28:43 - it's now showing the router plugin and
28:47 - view x
28:49 - can we try sidebar it says new
28:52 - uh yeah let me look at that
28:55 - sidebar
28:58 - what's the difference between a sidebar
28:59 - and a draw menu
29:02 - let's see toggle sidebar
29:05 - oh cool
29:06 - that looks nice actually
29:10 - i like that
29:13 - okay
29:14 - that's what i want
29:17 - um
29:18 - so using sidebar
29:20 - and using
29:22 - nav nav bar
29:27 - so let me look at navbar
29:30 - see what examples they have
29:32 - yeah i'm going to copy this basic navbar
29:34 - example then
29:36 - and first let me
29:39 - run the app again
29:41 - and i'm gonna stop this
29:44 - server for the view ui that i started
29:47 - yeah fancy
29:49 - um
29:52 - let's see
29:55 - uh
29:56 - what do i want to do
29:58 - oh yeah i keep wanting to type in
30:00 - python here because i've been running so
30:02 - many django commands
30:03 - i want to do npm
30:05 - start
30:09 - okay
30:11 - dev server spinning up again
30:13 - this will open
30:15 - the desktop app again
30:19 - and
30:20 - oh this was an accident
30:23 - so
30:26 - oh oops
30:28 - oh i'm gonna have to
30:30 - um
30:31 - fix
30:33 - this i think install or adding those
30:35 - view cli plugins messed it up because
30:38 - those are made for regular view projects
30:40 - and they might have intrusively changed
30:42 - some things that they weren't supposed
30:44 - to change in nwjs
30:47 - so maybe i should have installed them
30:48 - manually i don't know
30:50 - okay so i'll fix that in a second
30:53 - i did make a mistake here and that is i
30:56 - think
30:59 - bootstrap and at least view router and
31:01 - view x
31:02 - should have been installed
31:05 - in dev dependencies
31:07 - so
31:08 - i think i messed that up but
31:10 - i can always move that over later so i'm
31:12 - not too worried about that right now
31:16 - okay
31:16 - because once it builds i don't need
31:18 - those packages so i don't need to ship
31:21 - useless packages
31:25 - okay
31:26 - so in source let me see what
31:29 - what these things did
31:32 - yep so
31:34 - uh
31:35 - what did this do
31:37 - okay so it changed my app
31:40 - dot view file
31:42 - which i don't think this is a big deal
31:44 - here i think the main
31:45 - issue
31:46 - is that
31:48 - it
31:53 - changed this and for some reason
31:56 - the app is erroring
31:59 - here
32:02 - okay
32:03 - and then what else did it set up so it
32:05 - set up a store
32:06 - this is fine
32:08 - set up the index.router file
32:11 - um that should also be good although i
32:14 - don't need all of these routes
32:17 - so
32:17 - i'm going to change the routes
32:19 - so
32:20 - let's see why isn't this
32:23 - island disable
32:24 - oh yeah that's the iceland
32:26 - so creating a new view object render
32:31 - rendering the app so
32:34 - i don't see why
32:35 - um
32:38 - what was the error message
32:40 - oh okay i'll show you the error message
32:42 - why this would have a problem with it
32:45 - let me see
32:46 - so
32:49 - oh it's saying
32:50 - oh okay it's saying it can't resolve
32:53 - this i see
32:54 - assets
32:56 - asset.logo.png it's because there isn't
32:58 - one
32:59 - i'm pretty sure
33:01 - yeah because
33:02 - in this project
33:04 - it's expecting this to be a normal view
33:05 - project which already has an assets
33:08 - slash logo.png but this one doesn't
33:12 - so
33:12 - i'm gonna see
33:14 - uh
33:17 - where it's trying to pull that in
33:19 - okay so it's in home.view it's trying to
33:22 - display this logo.png
33:26 - yeah it does look okay
33:28 - um
33:29 - so
33:32 - what was it nw
33:34 - what was the file name
33:36 - let's see yeah nw.png so
33:40 - yeah now it works sweet and i have my
33:42 - view router set up
33:45 - so it works just like a normal view
33:46 - router
33:49 - okay cool
33:51 - um so let me open the developer tools
33:53 - for later so i have it
33:56 - oh yeah still has that error
34:02 - so it makes sense to rename them that
34:04 - should be fixed in the boiler plate to
34:06 - avoid this bug for others
34:09 - yeah
34:10 - so it's good it's good i'm testing out
34:12 - this boiler plate for everyone
34:15 - all right
34:17 - so now i have my router let me add that
34:19 - top nav in the sidebar now
34:22 - so
34:23 - in bootstrap
34:26 - i'm in nav bar so i'm going to copy this
34:28 - nav bar
34:29 - and then get rid of
34:31 - most of the stuff inside
34:35 - okay so
34:36 - nav bar
34:44 - let me also
34:46 - delete
34:47 - some of the extra stuff so let me delete
34:49 - this about page
34:52 - and then
34:53 - i have to delete it from router 2.
34:55 - so
34:56 - let me delete
35:00 - okay
35:06 - where is it uh let me also
35:08 - delete so the home page
35:11 - uh
35:13 - okay i'll leave that alone for right now
35:15 - so in this app.view this is where
35:18 - i'm gonna delete
35:19 - um
35:21 - or i'll add this above real quick so i
35:23 - have the
35:27 - um oops
35:30 - this
35:32 - i pasted the nav bar in and i need to
35:37 - indent
35:38 - this
35:40 - and now
35:43 - i need to
35:46 - let's see i need to get rid of
35:50 - all of these items i think
35:52 - what is navbar collapse
35:57 - oh yeah
35:58 - so that is
36:02 - um drop down item i don't think i need
36:05 - navbar collapse
36:08 - so let me get rid of that then
36:12 - just start from scratch with that
36:16 - okay
36:18 - so
36:19 - let's see how this looks
36:22 - okay so i just have a basic nav bar
36:23 - there oh am i
36:25 - i'm not importing the css
36:28 - that's what i'm not doing
36:30 - hi
36:31 - in namdee how are you
36:35 - that's a that's a cool name
36:37 - um
36:38 - welcome to free code camp
36:41 - so uh oh if you don't know i'm building
36:44 - a desktop app with
36:47 - uh nwjs and vue the link is in the
36:49 - description below
36:52 - so
36:53 - um now i have the navbar i'm not
36:55 - importing the bootstrap css or i must
36:57 - not be because it's not displaying
36:58 - anything so let me stop what i'm doing
37:01 - real quick go back to getting started
37:04 - and
37:09 - um where is it
37:13 - okay
37:14 - i need to scroll down
37:16 - okay using module bundlers
37:19 - in all my installs i forgot to actually
37:22 - set up bootstrap so i'm going to have to
37:24 - put this in my main.js file
37:28 - so let me go to
37:30 - that main.js file
37:34 - and
37:37 - well okay
37:38 - so absolute imports
37:41 - should go first
37:43 - and then
37:46 - i have relative imports and then
37:50 - i can put
37:53 - this here
37:57 - okay so now i'm registering this and i
38:00 - still need the css links
38:02 - oh no it didn't like that
38:06 - okay
38:08 - oh view imported twice that's why
38:11 - thanks
38:13 - okay so
38:16 - uh oh i guess i need the css here then
38:22 - because those are absolute imports
38:24 - or uh library imports what i mean
38:28 - okay
38:30 - so
38:33 - um css
38:35 - yeah so i think that's it
38:38 - oh also
38:40 - oh cool that looks nice this nav bar
38:43 - um also i would like
38:46 - um
38:50 - what was i going to say i can't remember
38:51 - what i was going to say but i'll i'll
38:53 - remember it in a minute
38:54 - so let me add that
38:57 - option to open the menu from the nav bar
39:00 - from bootstrap
39:02 - so in components where's that new
39:05 - sidebar
39:10 - okay
39:12 - it's a fixed position toggleable slide
39:15 - out box which can be used for navigation
39:16 - menus details
39:19 - okay
39:22 - so
39:24 - i'll copy the basic sidebar then
39:27 - and i'll also copy the button
39:31 - uh which toggles oh i didn't know in the
39:34 - docs now you can double click to edit
39:37 - oh that's pretty cool
39:41 - um yeah
39:43 - bootstrap docs are good
39:46 - so let me go to
39:49 - um
39:51 - where is it oh yeah in my
39:53 - app.js file
39:55 - so
39:56 - in app.js
39:59 - i'll go here
40:02 - and put the sidebar
40:06 - and now this button for toggle sidebar
40:08 - i'm going to put
40:10 - inside of
40:13 - v navbar toggles okay so i don't want
40:16 - that so let me put
40:21 - oh wait undo
40:22 - i think i have to yeah
40:26 - oh it's because i just
40:29 - undid that
40:31 - there we go
40:35 - let's see how that looks
40:38 - okay so toggle sidebar
40:40 - and i want to switch these two around i
40:43 - think
40:46 - and i'm going to rename this to
40:50 - menu
40:54 - that's pretty cool it has a prop to
40:57 - toggle the sidebar from the button
41:01 - um
41:02 - and the sidebar one okay so it's
41:04 - referencing the id here
41:07 - so
41:08 - i guess i'll call this
41:11 - sidebar not sidebar one because there's
41:14 - no other sidebar
41:16 - okay
41:18 - so that should still work
41:22 - yeah
41:24 - um
41:25 - the menu
41:26 - oh yeah and then i was gonna switch
41:28 - these around so
41:35 - oh that's that's pretty ugly
41:37 - oh because uh
41:39 - the title must be giving some margin
41:42 - right
41:43 - so i can just add some margin to
41:46 - this button then so i can add
41:49 - a class
41:50 - and use a margin shorthand from
41:52 - bootstrap
41:53 - which i think is margin
41:56 - margin right
41:58 - and i'll say 4 to push it out a little
42:01 - bit
42:01 - which is something like 16 pixels
42:04 - bootstrap doesn't do it exactly in
42:05 - increments of four pixels
42:07 - for these numbers so
42:09 - let's see
42:11 - yeah i think that looks okay
42:13 - um
42:15 - other docs using view live
42:19 - edit and see it update the demo in real
42:21 - time yeah it's using
42:24 - uh something so
42:27 - let's see i can get rid of shadow
42:31 - and now there's no elevation on the
42:33 - sidebar yeah so i guess that's v live
42:37 - i don't know but it's updating live
42:39 - for bootstrap that's pretty cool
42:43 - okay
42:44 - um so now i have the menu open now i
42:47 - need to put stuff in the sidebar that
42:48 - was really
42:49 - low effort like
42:51 - nice to use
42:53 - um
42:55 - so i'm gonna
42:57 - put that down here
42:59 - and
43:01 - get rid of the paragraph in the sidebar
43:07 - oh there's a title here so what should i
43:09 - call the title
43:10 - i guess i'll call it menu
43:12 - i could do username or with an avatar or
43:15 - something i don't know
43:17 - um
43:18 - or
43:19 - main menu
43:23 - okay and this
43:24 - so this div is just providing some
43:26 - spacing inside so padding
43:29 - on the x-axis of three
43:33 - um and then padding on the y-axis of two
43:36 - i'll leave that spacing div there and
43:40 - then i'm going to add
43:43 - these router links inside and see how
43:45 - they look
43:46 - and i might want to put these in a list
43:49 - i don't know how
43:52 - what would look best in bootstrap
43:59 - commit
44:02 - oh this is awful
44:03 - um yeah that was a bad idea
44:07 - so i'm going to put these in a list view
44:10 - in a bootstrap list
44:13 - so let me
44:14 - see first if they have an example here
44:19 - of
44:21 - shadow borders with padding disable
44:25 - scope header
44:27 - footer
44:29 - backdrop
44:32 - okay
44:35 - yeah i think it's getting
44:38 - all right so it has the full
44:40 - api details but i'm going to look for a
44:43 - list here
44:44 - so list group
44:48 - and let me see
44:51 - all right so that's a list group
44:54 - and
44:56 - oh it can show active items
44:59 - to indicate a selection
45:02 - so
45:03 - it's not exactly
45:05 - what i want or maybe i'm just used to
45:07 - the material
45:09 - uh
45:10 - design from beautify all the time
45:14 - or if you prefer
45:16 - button elements over
45:18 - links see the button prop okay so you
45:21 - can
45:22 - make these into buttons instead of
45:26 - list links i guess
45:29 - um
45:31 - colors badges
45:41 - okay
45:42 - um yeah i think unless someone knows of
45:44 - something better let me look for
45:48 - list
45:49 - actionable
45:51 - list group items
45:56 - yeah so this is what i want i mean the
45:59 - style can always be changed later it's
46:00 - not a big deal so i'm going to copy this
46:04 - list group
46:08 - and
46:09 - put it
46:10 - inside the draw
46:18 - okay
46:20 - and now
46:21 - so inside of each
46:23 - list group item
46:26 - i'm gonna have
46:31 - um
46:32 - yeah i'm gonna have the view router link
46:34 - so
46:35 - oh let me get rid of it
46:38 - add it here and then
46:44 - okay
46:46 - that works i can change the color and
46:48 - underline state i guess
46:50 - and then
46:55 - and i'll just get rid of about here so i
46:57 - can just copy this link
47:00 - um
47:02 - oh
47:02 - okay so there's actually an href from
47:05 - here and then there's a router link
47:07 - inside so
47:09 - actually
47:10 - oh wait
47:11 - um i don't need
47:13 - the
47:15 - router link inside
47:18 - which will stop the need for extra
47:20 - styling which is good so i'll just put a
47:22 - forward slash here
47:24 - and have home that looks pretty good
47:27 - the home link
47:29 - so
47:30 - let me
47:32 - what's next so i guess i can add all of
47:35 - these links that i have in the mock-ups
47:37 - down here
47:40 - let's see
47:44 - oh my other mock-up i see where it is
47:47 - i'm it's not displaying so i must have
47:49 - spelled it wrong in the readme
47:54 - okay
47:55 - um
47:58 - let's see
48:01 - add entry
48:06 - um yeah so i need a button at the top
48:08 - actually and then i need these four
48:10 - links
48:11 - and then a horizontal line
48:14 - so
48:16 - there might actually be a bootstrap
48:17 - component for this horizontal line
48:20 - so let me see
48:22 - hours log projects
48:24 - exports and settings
48:29 - so
48:32 - hours log
48:40 - okay
48:41 - then
48:44 - projects
48:46 - and then
48:49 - exports
48:50 - and
48:52 - oh wait
48:55 - uh settings
49:03 - all right
49:04 - so now i have the menu here
49:07 - and
49:10 - um what else
49:12 - i guess i don't need a horizontal line
49:14 - unless i could make these two different
49:15 - list groups actually so i could
49:18 - what i could do is
49:20 - actually here close that list group and
49:23 - then make another
49:25 - b
49:26 - oh wait
49:27 - b list
49:28 - group
49:34 - yeah and then
49:36 - just
49:38 - very quickly i can add a class of margin
49:41 - top
49:42 - of two give it a little bit of spacing
49:46 - yeah that's okay for now
49:49 - uh class drop down divider
49:52 - okay
49:55 - oh jared wants to post a link so let me
49:58 - show the link
50:01 - get bootstrap docs components dropdowns
50:04 - dividers
50:06 - cool thank you
50:08 - um oh get out of that let
50:10 - me divider
50:15 - oh i'm looking i'm looking in view
50:17 - router for dividers let me go to
50:24 - uh drop down
50:28 - these are all in drop downs
50:33 - and i can't scroll down
50:35 - so
50:37 - they don't have a divider component but
50:38 - since i'm updating bootstrap like you
50:40 - mentioned
50:41 - i can
50:43 - oh
50:44 - cool
50:45 - because i'm getting the chat directly
50:47 - through youtube this time so it's
50:48 - letting me copy paste
50:50 - or copy from the chat
50:53 - okay so let me copy this divider then
50:56 - and see how it looks
50:58 - um in between these two list groups i'll
51:01 - paste that divider
51:05 - nice so i have the two different list
51:07 - groups
51:09 - and then i have a divider
51:12 - and then i guess i can get rid of this
51:14 - margin class because it looks like
51:17 - it's the same space on either side of
51:19 - the divider either way
51:22 - okay
51:24 - good so now i have a menu
51:27 - so now i need to make this main home
51:29 - page
51:31 - and
51:33 - let's
51:34 - see oh yeah let me go to the mock-up and
51:38 - look at the main page
51:40 - so it's basically a table of all the
51:44 - hour logs
51:46 - that looks fine
51:48 - yeah i think it looks it looks fine to
51:51 - me
51:52 - i mean you're the you're a design expert
51:54 - so
51:56 - and we can always change something later
52:00 - okay so
52:02 - hours log
52:06 - um oh yeah so i need a bootstrap table
52:08 - here
52:09 - the tabs i'm going to worry about these
52:11 - tabs later so for right now i'm going to
52:14 - have a title
52:15 - a button
52:16 - and
52:17 - a table with four columns
52:20 - so let me just work on that
52:23 - and
52:26 - okay so i have app.view
52:28 - and then this router view
52:32 - is
52:33 - displayed and actually i'm going to need
52:34 - to use the view
52:39 - what is it called the grid system not
52:41 - the view grid system but the bootstrap
52:42 - grid system
52:44 - so
52:45 - let me find which component i'm going to
52:47 - use right now i only have this one
52:49 - component which is home
52:52 - and actually
52:54 - i'm going to change this
52:57 - to
52:59 - hours log
53:02 - um
53:04 - and the component will be hours log
53:10 - so
53:13 - hours long
53:19 - hours log
53:21 - okay and now i need to actually rename
53:23 - this component to
53:25 - hours
53:26 - log oh wait
53:29 - uh hours log
53:32 - and i'll delete the hello world
53:36 - i'll delete this image
53:38 - i'll give it a class of
53:40 - hours log page
53:44 - um in case i want to name space my sas
53:47 - later
53:50 - oh is it slog did i put slog
53:54 - hours
53:55 - log
53:57 - yeah it's hours long
53:59 - i don't think i misspelled it anywhere
54:03 - our slog
54:05 - okay
54:08 - so
54:09 - i'll get rid of the hello world
54:11 - component
54:12 - the name here should be
54:15 - hours log
54:18 - okay
54:20 - how is everyone else everyone else is
54:22 - kind of quiet in the chat
54:24 - how do you think it's going so far
54:30 - so i have the hours log page and
54:35 - i need
54:37 - i need a title first and actually here
54:40 - so let me go ahead and look at the
54:42 - bootstrap grid system because i'm going
54:44 - to need to implement that so let me look
54:46 - for
54:47 - grid
54:51 - uh layout and grid system
54:53 - so
54:54 - okay so it's b container b row
54:56 - and b column which is
54:59 - same thing as usual
55:03 - all right so i'm going to change this
55:05 - div into
55:07 - b
55:07 - container actually
55:11 - and then
55:13 - i'll do b
55:16 - container
55:18 - and then inside of that i'll do a b row
55:22 - and then i'll do a b column
55:25 - here so
55:26 - uh b
55:28 - column
55:30 - your legs are shaking and excitement
55:32 - great
55:38 - okay
55:39 - so
55:42 - um i don't know how exciting the mvp is
55:45 - but it's definitely exciting if i can
55:47 - get this app working
55:51 - so
55:55 - let's see
55:58 - um b-row here's here's column
56:02 - which i want so how do i
56:05 - okay so i can do offset equals or offset
56:07 - dash small
56:10 - and then okay so the props are small
56:13 - medium large extra large normal
56:16 - so into b column i want the table
56:19 - centered
56:20 - on the page so i guess for small
56:23 - oops for small i'll do
56:27 - let me try eight columns and then
56:30 - offset small
56:32 - is
56:34 - two columns
56:35 - because there's a total of 12 columns
56:38 - and then i'll put the header in here
56:42 - so i'll put
56:43 - actually
56:45 - i want
56:47 - the header and
56:51 - let's see so this column will contain
56:54 - everything on the page
56:55 - and then inside of this column i'm
56:57 - actually going to do
56:59 - this is the thing about component
57:00 - libraries there's so much nesting
57:02 - so
57:03 - i'm going to do another b column
57:06 - because i want the header
57:10 - inside of a b column
57:15 - and now i'll put an h1 in here
57:18 - and i think this is how i want it unless
57:20 - i just want to do
57:24 - some flexbox in here but
57:27 - so let me give this a title of hours log
57:30 - close that and then close the column
57:33 - and then i want another column here
57:37 - which will be for the button for this
57:41 - add entry button
57:44 - so
57:45 - i think the button
57:47 - oh let me add the column first so b
57:49 - column and then i think button in
57:51 - bootstrap will be
57:53 - be
57:55 - btn
57:57 - and then
57:59 - that will be
58:01 - add
58:02 - what is it
58:03 - i forgot what it was already add entry
58:07 - add entry
58:10 - okay and then close the button
58:12 - close the column
58:14 - close the row
58:16 - and i think that's it
58:20 - yeah and then i'll add another rule with
58:22 - the table in it
58:25 - yeah that's pretty good the only other
58:27 - thing is on this
58:29 - nested row here i want to add a margin
58:31 - top so it's not pushed up against the
58:33 - very top of the page
58:35 - so class
58:36 - equals
58:37 - margin top of
58:40 - five
58:43 - yeah that looks pretty good
58:46 - and
58:50 - what else oh yeah that button
58:52 - should also have a color
58:55 - so i think i'm gonna put
58:58 - is it color or there was another keyword
59:01 - i can't remember what it is
59:03 - for primary
59:05 - nope that doesn't work so let me look
59:08 - for button in here or i can just click
59:10 - on button
59:14 - oh variant that was it yeah thank you
59:17 - anish
59:19 - it's variant
59:21 - uh variant
59:26 - okay wow that's bright
59:28 - um
59:30 - that's fine so they can add entry
59:33 - and
59:34 - now i'm gonna put a table below this
59:37 - so it's been exactly one hour
59:40 - and we already have a desktop app i'm
59:42 - pretty happy with this
59:43 - and we have another
59:45 - almost an hour to go
59:49 - so
59:52 - um
59:53 - let's see
59:54 - oh yeah table let me get a table
59:56 - component
59:58 - i need some water
60:07 - all right
60:09 - need a bootstrap table
60:12 - oh wow do they have table light and
60:14 - table simple
60:16 - i wonder what those are
60:20 - let me look
60:22 - table okay so it's all under table
60:26 - so for displaying tabular data b table
60:28 - sports pagination filtering sorting
60:31 - custom rendering various styling options
60:33 - events and asynchronous data
60:37 - yeah the hour went back one by fast
60:41 - you know even when i've done like four
60:43 - hour streams they just seem to fly by
60:46 - like nothing
60:48 - well especially now that people chat
60:50 - when my very first couple live streams
60:53 - where it was just me talking to myself
60:56 - they felt like they took a long time
61:00 - so supports pagination filtering sorting
61:03 - custom rendering various styling options
61:04 - events extinct data a lot of stuff
61:07 - for simple display of tabular data
61:09 - without all the fancy features bootstrap
61:10 - u provides two lightweight alternative
61:14 - components
61:15 - b table light and b table simple
61:18 - um so i'm not going to use those but
61:20 - that's good to know about because i do
61:22 - want this to be
61:26 - filterable sortable
61:28 - and support infinite scroll which is
61:33 - pagination
61:36 - so i'm gonna use
61:38 - a basic b table
61:41 - and i guess i'll start off with just
61:44 - the most basic
61:46 - variety
61:49 - um
61:50 - okay so
61:52 - so it's not passing in the headers
61:54 - separately
61:56 - so i guess it's getting the header items
61:58 - or it must be getting them from the keys
62:02 - in the objects
62:07 - so let me
62:10 - um okay so let me make a new row here
62:13 - b row
62:16 - and
62:17 - inside of it put
62:19 - a b column even though it's full width i
62:22 - want it to match up with any spacing
62:25 - with the above rows and columns
62:30 - okay
62:32 - oops so b
62:35 - o b row
62:38 - and then i think that's right and now
62:41 - let me
62:42 - paste the table inside and let me copy
62:45 - the items too actually
62:47 - so let me get this
62:50 - um
62:51 - actually i don't think i have any of
62:53 - this so
62:57 - oh no i do so let me just get the
63:00 - data then okay
63:03 - so i have components
63:06 - and
63:11 - now i have the items on the table
63:13 - nice so i have a table
63:17 - of
63:18 - items
63:19 - um
63:21 - yeah
63:23 - it's not the columns that i want though
63:25 - so let me update the columns
63:28 - so i need project name i need date start
63:31 - and end
63:34 - okay
63:35 - so
63:36 - let me delete all these extra rows for
63:39 - right now and just update this one so
63:43 - project and then underscore name
63:47 - because i guess that's how you denote
63:49 - for the column like how many words you
63:52 - want you put underscores in the middle
63:53 - even though javascript generally doesn't
63:55 - use
63:56 - underscores
63:58 - so what should i call
64:00 - uh
64:02 - i'll just call this
64:04 - company one
64:06 - and then
64:12 - um and then
64:14 - date
64:15 - oh date
64:18 - and
64:19 - i'll say may
64:21 - 12
64:22 - 2020
64:24 - and then i'll do
64:27 - start
64:28 - time
64:30 - which is
64:34 - i don't know
64:35 - uh start time
64:38 - you now i'll do
64:40 - uh
64:41 - should i do 24 hour clock
64:44 - um
64:48 - let me do seven
64:49 - oh seven
64:52 - a.m yeah
64:55 - sorry
64:56 - i'm using the 12-hour clock because i'm
64:59 - from america
65:00 - and it's just easier for me
65:03 - so maybe that will be an option in
65:04 - settings later
65:06 - so um let me do
65:10 - 11 am
65:16 - not
65:17 - a fan or returns
65:21 - oh you're not a fan of returns what does
65:24 - that mean
65:25 - i don't know what that means
65:30 - um
65:33 - let's see
65:35 - oh cool awesome
65:38 - so now i have my first log entry here
65:40 - and just um
65:42 - to make this a little bit better i'm
65:44 - going to put some spacing in between the
65:46 - header and the table
65:48 - so
65:49 - let's see
65:51 - um
65:52 - since i already have a class here i'm
65:54 - gonna add it here so i'll do
65:56 - margin bottom
65:58 - and try four
66:01 - yeah that adds some good spacing between
66:03 - the table and then later on there will
66:05 - be tabs here so you can see the table
66:08 - view or a list view that will show the
66:10 - logs
66:14 - oh you're saying i'm not a fan of
66:15 - returns because i put all my code on one
66:18 - line
66:19 - no i like returns
66:21 - um actually this should
66:23 - all right i'll do this
66:25 - i'll i'll do this nicely real quick
66:28 - this should have
66:30 - returns in it
66:36 - okay
66:37 - everyone's happy now
66:41 - that's better
66:43 - okay and now i want to create a second
66:44 - page now that i have hours log
66:48 - let me hook up the projects page
66:51 - and
66:53 - so the projects page
66:55 - actually i need an ad entry page too
66:58 - but let me just hook up the projects
67:00 - page real quick so i have the second
67:02 - route
67:04 - and this will have a drop down of all
67:06 - the projects
67:08 - um and then
67:11 - oh i need a button here too actually so
67:13 - i need a button here for add a project
67:16 - because the projects are what you're
67:18 - going to associate your hours with so
67:20 - when you log new hours you need to
67:21 - associate it
67:23 - with a project
67:26 - yeah so and we're gonna have that
67:28 - association in the database
67:30 - as you can see
67:32 - um so i have a projects table or i will
67:34 - have a projects table
67:36 - or collection or whatever it's gonna be
67:38 - um and then where is the oh time entry
67:43 - and then i'll have time entries
67:45 - um
67:47 - and then yeah solve time entries and
67:50 - then i was thinking about making
67:51 - separate log entries although if it's no
67:54 - sequel then i probably won't make these
67:56 - separate tables
67:58 - but
67:59 - yeah i'm going to figure out
68:01 - if it's sql or nosql probably for the
68:04 - next stream
68:06 - so anyway um
68:10 - and if you watch my video on consulting
68:13 - then you'll know why i have
68:15 - logs of what i did every day because
68:17 - when we export
68:19 - the
68:21 - the documents for a client to see it
68:23 - will have log entries of the time you
68:26 - worked on the day and also bullet points
68:28 - of like all the different things you did
68:30 - that day
68:32 - and what you accomplished okay so
68:34 - projects so i need
68:37 - the title
68:38 - i need to add new project button and
68:40 - then i need this drop down here
68:42 - so let me create a new view because it's
68:45 - a separate page
68:47 - so i'll call this projects dot view
68:52 - i keep hitting escape because i'm so
68:53 - used to using vim
68:55 - so then it deletes the file that i'm
68:57 - trying to make
68:58 - okay projects dot view enter
69:02 - and let me start off with a
69:04 - template and let me go to hours log and
69:08 - steal some of this stuff here so
69:13 - um yeah let me steal all of this
69:15 - actually
69:16 - everything and then i'll delete the
69:18 - table basically so
69:20 - yank that
69:22 - and
69:24 - paste it here
69:27 - and then delete this table
69:30 - okay and now let me hook this into the
69:33 - actually let me change the title real
69:34 - quick
69:35 - so projects
69:37 - and
69:39 - add
69:42 - new
69:44 - project
69:47 - all right
69:48 - and now let me hook this into the router
69:51 - so i'll make a new
69:53 - um
69:56 - what's oh okay
69:58 - so let me make a new
70:00 - route the path will be
70:07 - project
70:09 - so
70:10 - projects
70:14 - the component will be projects and
70:17 - the name will be
70:20 - projects
70:21 - okay
70:22 - and i'll duplicate this
70:27 - projects
70:31 - projects
70:34 - okay and now i need to make a link
70:36 - and actually i'm gonna
70:38 - put the
70:39 - forward slash i don't know if i need it
70:41 - but
70:43 - just to match up with this one unless i
70:45 - shouldn't put it there i can't remember
70:46 - what what i did in all my other view
70:48 - routers
70:50 - okay so
70:52 - um oh yeah in my
70:54 - navigation
70:57 - let me do
70:59 - projects
71:04 - and now if i go to projects
71:08 - it doesn't do anything okay
71:13 - let me refresh this
71:16 - does it refresh doesn't refresh
71:19 - projects
71:21 - why doesn't it
71:23 - must be with the
71:24 - routing okay yes pass starts with
71:27 - forward slash okay so it's not routing
71:30 - correctly
71:31 - and
71:32 - i wonder if that's
71:34 - um
71:35 - [Music]
71:37 - because i should be using
71:40 - the view router 2 for these view router
71:43 - routes instead of an href
71:48 - i don't think
71:52 - is it the order
71:56 - oh because it's matching
71:58 - i see what you're saying because it's
71:59 - matching this route before it ever gets
72:01 - to this route i could try changing the
72:03 - order here let me try
72:10 - all right
72:11 - let me try
72:13 - going to projects
72:15 - nope it's not the order
72:16 - for some reason it is refreshing because
72:18 - the council the console is refreshing so
72:23 - i guess it's a problem i would say
72:26 - that it's a problem with
72:31 - with the href instead of using two
72:35 - so it's not using view router
72:38 - yeah
72:39 - so i think i'll have to do that because
72:42 - if i do
72:44 - let's say
72:51 - uh it shouldn't be the order all my
72:52 - routes start with forward slash yeah i
72:55 - thought so
72:56 - okay so i'm gonna change it back then
72:59 - real quick
73:02 - okay so try that idea
73:04 - now
73:05 - now let me do
73:07 - uh
73:08 - [Music]
73:10 - oh it's router link
73:12 - uh router link
73:13 - two equals
73:15 - uh slash projects
73:19 - and then
73:23 - close the router link
73:25 - and let me get rid of
73:30 - um the href here
73:34 - although now it's just gonna have the
73:35 - text as a link instead of the whole
73:37 - button
73:39 - so
73:40 - yeah i have to click on the text
73:42 - which stinks
73:46 - oh try putting oh because it's not
73:48 - history mode that's right
73:51 - so
73:52 - my router is not set up in history mode
73:55 - so maybe if i put um
73:58 - the hashtag
74:00 - not the hashtag the
74:03 - pound sign first
74:06 - okay let me try that
74:09 - yeah because i think that's probably why
74:11 - it's refreshing
74:15 - all right so
74:17 - let me go back to
74:19 - yeah it's not going anywhere in here too
74:21 - so let me do this
74:23 - as well
74:28 - um okay so let me go
74:32 - here now yeah that works cool
74:35 - so now it's looking for
74:37 - the
74:38 - hash router
74:40 - instead of the history router
74:45 - okay so now i have add a new project
74:48 - and i'll also have a filterable search
74:52 - search searchable
74:54 - drop down
74:57 - um so let me add that
75:02 - and
75:05 - it would be called
75:06 - drop down i guess
75:09 - or it would prob it would be a select
75:11 - actually
75:14 - yeah because these are just drop down
75:16 - with links that's not what i want at all
75:19 - so let me do
75:21 - uh jared says i would just use view
75:23 - route of programmatically
75:25 - routing and look for the route names
75:27 - instead of paths
75:29 - um
75:31 - yeah i could do that
75:33 - i'm okay with how it is now
75:39 - yeah that's what i'm doing but this
75:40 - isn't just a two-hour project so i'm
75:42 - going to be hopefully working on this
75:44 - the next
75:46 - couple weeks making this actual work the
75:49 - only thing i'm not going to do
75:51 - on one of these streams is actually
75:55 - building this app for different os's
75:57 - because
75:59 - i guess it doesn't say it here but
76:01 - apparently it takes forever to build one
76:03 - of these desktop apps so i'm gonna have
76:05 - to do that off stream but
76:07 - all the other setup i should be doing
76:10 - on stream
76:12 - uh where will you be working on it at
76:16 - i'll be i'll be doing all of the work
76:18 - for this project on these free code camp
76:20 - streams on fridays so friday morning
76:23 - 10 to 12
76:24 - is my slot
76:26 - that i've been given
76:29 - so yeah
76:33 - form select this is what i want
76:38 - okay so
76:40 - these are
76:41 - drop down selects that i want
76:45 - and let's see what components
76:48 - um
76:49 - bootstrap has for this because i really
76:51 - want the user to be able to start typing
76:54 - and search for an item
76:56 - and eventually i'll have to be making
76:58 - api calls based off their search so i
77:00 - don't pull in
77:02 - oh no no this is a desktop app what am i
77:04 - talking about
77:06 - uh yeah this should be fine
77:08 - but i still want them to be able to type
77:10 - in and search
77:13 - oh fc
77:14 - fcc free code cam
77:17 - i'm not going to be doing it on my
77:19 - twitch account
77:26 - um
77:28 - please select some item
77:31 - value in single mode yeah
77:36 - okay that's multiple select
77:39 - don't want that
77:42 - don't want that
77:46 - yeah so i don't think bootstrap has it
77:48 - let me see if it has
77:51 - search no
77:52 - there's no search
77:54 - um
77:55 - i could look at their api for this
77:57 - component
78:00 - properties
78:02 - properties they don't have any events oh
78:04 - they do
78:07 - so input
78:09 - change
78:10 - so i'll have i'll be listening for an on
78:12 - change event
78:14 - because i'll load the project that they
78:15 - choose based off of that
78:21 - and that's going to also route them to
78:22 - the next page
78:23 - with a breadcrumb to go back
78:28 - okay so those are properties
78:32 - um and the properties
78:36 - yeah they don't have any
78:39 - typing in
78:40 - so i could just add
78:46 - i could add that at another library for
78:49 - that
78:50 - let's see
78:52 - um
78:53 - view
78:54 - select component i can't remember what i
78:56 - added last time
78:58 - but there's got to be at least several
79:00 - of these components
79:04 - okay view select
79:06 - is a feature reach feature
79:08 - feature rich
79:10 - drop down component
79:17 - all right
79:18 - that looks nice
79:21 - and you can start typing so i could
79:23 - start typing
79:26 - nigeria
79:28 - and select it cool
79:30 - and then it has it's clearable by
79:33 - default or
79:34 - an option for it anyway
79:38 - okay
79:39 - this
79:40 - seems to be good
79:42 - the last relate date is in july
79:45 - oh let me zoom in
79:47 - let me take a look at their github real
79:48 - quick
79:53 - view select
79:58 - yeah
79:59 - looks looks fine
80:01 - to me so i'm gonna go ahead and go with
80:04 - this
80:06 - and go to installation
80:12 - installation
80:14 - my computer is running really hot right
80:16 - now
80:18 - okay so i need to install it and then
80:21 - register it as a component
80:24 - so let me go and stop my server
80:29 - clear
80:39 - alright so that's installing
80:43 - and now
80:45 - while that's installing oh it closed my
80:48 - windows for me i didn't realize it would
80:50 - do that
80:51 - um so let me import
80:55 - these
80:57 - and then the component doesn't include
80:58 - any css so i can import that separately
81:04 - or i can import the scss so that's one
81:06 - thing i really should have set up i
81:08 - guess is scss
81:11 - i guess i can set it up later
81:15 - but it would be nice to have like a sass
81:17 - folder for when i want to customize the
81:19 - styles
81:21 - okay so
81:24 - let me go to
81:25 - [Music]
81:26 - main.js and after bootstrap
81:30 - i'll import the view select
81:33 - and then
81:36 - oh no this goes here
81:39 - uh
81:40 - yeah that goes there
81:42 - and let me delete that
81:45 - and now i need to import the css
81:48 - so
81:49 - i'll import that
81:54 - and um
81:56 - yeah
81:58 - put that
82:00 - oh wait
82:01 - there
82:03 - okay so now it has the css
82:10 - yeah that's fine
82:12 - um
82:13 - installation
82:15 - uh drop down options
82:19 - okay so now that i've registered the
82:21 - component i can use it
82:24 - as a v select and then pass it
82:29 - props
82:30 - i guess
82:31 - so the props would make it
82:33 - oh it's searchable without me passing in
82:36 - any extra pops that's nice
82:40 - all right so let me close main.js
82:45 - close that
82:46 - i can close this
82:48 - and i'm just working out of projects now
82:50 - and i'm going to put that v select
82:52 - inside of here
82:54 - so oh yeah let me run the server first
82:57 - so i need to start that server again
83:00 - so npm
83:02 - start
83:24 - all right building webpack is going okay
83:27 - it's done
83:29 - now it'll open there
83:31 - and let me get
83:34 - so i
83:37 - v select options so i could just pass an
83:39 - array or i can pass
83:43 - in array of objects which is what i want
83:45 - to do for options
83:48 - because i want the value to be different
83:51 - from the label basically
83:53 - yeah
83:56 - it is but after initial build it's okay
84:00 - and
84:04 - soon we'll have
84:05 - i guess better options to webpack or
84:08 - advanced webpack that builds faster
84:11 - i don't know
84:12 - or maybe better computers that build
84:14 - webpack faster maybe it's my computer
84:16 - that's slow
84:18 - yeah vi vite is exciting
84:22 - um
84:24 - let's see view three should be out next
84:27 - month and then i guess vite
84:29 - or vite version one should be out in a
84:31 - couple months i think
84:34 - am i right
84:36 - all right so
84:37 - i'm gonna
84:40 - get rid of that make it self-closing and
84:44 - then also
84:46 - just so
84:48 - i get my returns in there so let me
84:51 - put this on multiple lines
84:56 - and see how that looks go to menu
84:58 - projects
85:01 - awesome
85:04 - and it works out of the box it doesn't
85:06 - quite match the bootstrap styling but
85:08 - it's pretty close
85:10 - and i'm not too worried about it
85:12 - um
85:13 - so basically
85:15 - i'll have a list of the projects here
85:17 - once i have projects
85:19 - and then they'll display and i'll be
85:22 - able to search for them and actually
85:24 - because i have view x i can go ahead and
85:26 - be saving things in view x even before
85:29 - i get a database
85:31 - oh you're saying because it's mac it's
85:32 - slow no this computer is like five years
85:34 - old
85:36 - and i've been running it
85:38 - like all day every day for the last five
85:41 - years
85:42 - um
85:45 - it keeps the desk nice and toasty
85:47 - i think it actually makes this room hot
85:49 - with all the lighting
85:51 - and the mac and everything this room
85:54 - gets like 10 degrees hotter while i'm
85:56 - streaming
85:59 - okay so i'm going to leave this page as
86:01 - it is for now
86:03 - and
86:06 - exports and settings pages i guess i'll
86:08 - have to work on those
86:10 - next stream or if i get time later but i
86:12 - do want to make this ad entry page
86:16 - um
86:17 - oh yeah and i wanted to have a button at
86:18 - the top here
86:20 - to as a shortcut
86:22 - but i guess if this is the default page
86:24 - anyway maybe i don't want the button i
86:26 - don't know
86:27 - it's only a few pages in the app
86:31 - um yeah but i am gonna get a new mac
86:34 - hopefully soon i picked out all my specs
86:36 - but they're just so expensive i'm just
86:39 - waiting as long as possible
86:45 - i have a linux computer that works great
86:48 - for everything but i don't stream from
86:50 - it
86:51 - and
86:52 - i don't have my client software on it
86:54 - either so i kind of work on work on the
86:56 - side with that
86:59 - okay so ad entry i need to make
87:03 - i guess a time entry page
87:07 - and let's see so in views
87:12 - i'll make new file
87:15 - should i call it time entry
87:17 - time entry dot view
87:20 - and this will have a template too
87:23 - and
87:26 - i'll do the same kind of things v
87:28 - container
87:30 - v row
87:35 - v
87:36 - column
87:38 - then
87:39 - i won't have a second column here so i
87:40 - think i'll just do h1
87:42 - and then
87:45 - new time
87:47 - entry
87:54 - uh
87:56 - wait until apple silicone comes out huh
87:59 - yeah
88:02 - that they just really want computers to
88:04 - be phones yeah i don't know i don't know
88:06 - about
88:07 - that i'm just what i'm happy about is
88:09 - that they fixed that keyboard
88:11 - and now they're no longer using the
88:13 - butterfly keyboards they have the magic
88:14 - keyboard
88:16 - which
88:17 - is supposed to be much better
88:19 - so because the butterfly keyboard my
88:21 - friends who have it most of them
88:24 - broke keys or a trouble and i just
88:26 - didn't like typing on it at all
88:28 - so i'm i'm really happy they
88:31 - fixed that
88:32 - after a couple years
88:34 - but they fixed it
88:36 - the new mac also has a physical escape
88:39 - key i don't want to be talking too much
88:40 - about mac but i think that was a better
88:44 - option to add that back instead of just
88:46 - a
88:48 - bar
88:50 - whatever the screen bar thing
88:54 - okay so now i have add new time entry
88:56 - this will be where the form is
88:59 - um
89:00 - okay now i need to make this page
89:02 - routable
89:04 - so in my routes
89:07 - i'm gonna
89:10 - say okay so i have hours log so actually
89:13 - after hours log
89:15 - i'm gonna do
89:19 - i don't know
89:20 - add
89:23 - time
89:26 - entry because i'll have an ad log entry
89:28 - too later
89:31 - so
89:37 - uh time entry component
89:46 - and
89:50 - time entry
89:52 - imported from
89:55 - uh time entry
90:01 - uh
90:02 - yeah i'm happy with i've
90:04 - gotten yes using vm without sp physical
90:07 - escape key yeah that's that was a big
90:10 - thing that i didn't like because i use
90:12 - the escape key all the time and actually
90:14 - on so
90:15 - at my desk here when i'm not streaming i
90:17 - use um
90:20 - programmable keyboard so i have my
90:22 - escape key right at my pinky finger so i
90:24 - can just hit escape all the time it's
90:26 - right next to there instead of being way
90:28 - up in the corner which isn't ideal for
90:29 - vim users
90:32 - uh
90:34 - a complaint terminal what's a complaint
90:37 - terminal
90:38 - windows has a complaint terminal
90:41 - to complain to windows about things you
90:43 - don't like about it
90:45 - yeah i used windows for years before i
90:47 - used mac
90:49 - um
90:51 - let's see
90:53 - i just think for development
90:55 - linux and mac are easier and mac is the
90:58 - one
90:58 - that has a lot of programs working for
91:01 - it but we'll see how windows turns out
91:04 - with their new adoption of linux i'm
91:06 - excited about that
91:08 - okay so time entry i need a form here
91:09 - let me go grab a bootstrap form
91:14 - form
91:16 - oh i'm not in the right place let me go
91:19 - here bootstrap form
91:24 - okay bootstrap form component and helper
91:27 - components that optionally support
91:29 - inline form styles
91:33 - okay so here's the basic form
91:35 - i'm just going to copy it because it
91:36 - looks fine to me
91:40 - form data results okay
91:45 - oh cool it has already has an on reset
91:49 - method as well
91:52 - so
91:55 - let me
91:59 - uh take the whole form
92:03 - and paste it in here
92:06 - then i'll just get rid of
92:08 - the stuff that
92:10 - i don't want
92:15 - okay b form so i need to indent that
92:18 - yeah i think that's good
92:20 - um
92:23 - yeah that looks good
92:24 - and now
92:26 - i might need
92:28 - do i need data in here
92:30 - oh i also need to make a route
92:33 - for the card
92:35 - um
92:37 - class form oh this is form data the form
92:40 - data results okay
92:43 - so
92:44 - and these are
92:46 - the v bound
92:48 - variables
92:49 - in
92:50 - the data method
92:53 - okay food so that must be some kind of a
92:55 - drop down show equals true i don't need
92:58 - show and hide so i'm going to get rid of
93:00 - that
93:02 - be if oops what did i do
93:05 - um
93:10 - let me go to
93:12 - here
93:19 - okay so
93:20 - on reset on submit i'll have to make
93:21 - those methods
93:23 - and then
93:25 - form group why do form groups only have
93:27 - one input or i guess if you're doing
93:30 - things on the same line
93:33 - uh can we have the new entry form on a
93:35 - modal box i want i want it on a separate
93:38 - page
93:40 - um
93:41 - i think
93:42 - yeah i don't always like forms and
93:44 - modals although sometimes
93:47 - it's okay
93:48 - i guess if i was doing it in a table no
93:51 - even then i don't know
93:53 - um anyone else have an opinion about
93:57 - putting the form in a modal
94:01 - uh
94:02 - can we have a new entry what's nice
94:04 - about nwjs though is that you can write
94:06 - all of your code once and it will run on
94:08 - windows linux and osx yes
94:11 - that is the nice thing
94:13 - modals are just asking for trouble
94:15 - thanks
94:19 - asking for trouble
94:22 - okay so let me get rid of some of these
94:24 - extra inputs
94:27 - and check boxes i can leave those
94:30 - okay i'm going gonna need to make
94:33 - a script tag here so i can remodel my
94:36 - elements
94:38 - so i need data
94:41 - and return an object
94:44 - and then
94:48 - so form data and then i'll need to
94:50 - remodel all of my elements inside of
94:52 - here
94:53 - and then i need two methods as well so
94:56 - let me go ahead and create those methods
94:57 - on a methods object
94:59 - i need on submit
95:02 - which is a method yep
95:04 - and
95:06 - what's the other one oh
95:09 - it's called on reset
95:12 - so on reset to reset the form
95:19 - okay
95:23 - avoid modals whenever possible
95:26 - yeah i hear that from designers all the
95:28 - time
95:29 - avoid modals or
95:31 - yeah
95:34 - basically don't use modals for forms
95:37 - just for displaying information
95:40 - um okay
95:45 - so
95:49 - let's see
95:52 - um what was i doing oh yeah let me make
95:55 - it the page routable so when i click add
95:57 - entry it should route to this time entry
95:59 - page
96:00 - um so i need to put that on the hours
96:03 - log
96:04 - this add entry
96:06 - so
96:09 - split up the lines here
96:11 - and then
96:14 - i'll add the add click at the end so
96:16 - when they click on this add entry button
96:20 - it should
96:21 - route them
96:23 - so i think i can do router.push
96:27 - because
96:29 - because i have the router object
96:30 - available to me
96:32 - in the component so if i do dot push and
96:35 - then push the route that i want
96:38 - which is
96:40 - um i think from here i can do name right
96:44 - so i can say
96:45 - just denote the name of the route that i
96:47 - want
96:48 - um
96:50 - which is time entry
96:54 - so
96:55 - i can do
96:56 - name time entry and then
97:00 - from time entry
97:03 - i'm not sure if view router will break
97:05 - but i just want to add the component
97:07 - name here so it matches up
97:10 - time entry
97:13 - okay
97:16 - that's good so
97:20 - uh
97:22 - yeah what just happened there
97:27 - okay
97:36 - uh oh yeah all of this stuff is not
97:38 - defined i need to clean up my form
97:43 - uh
97:45 - does that have something to do with
97:46 - accessibility okay
97:48 - you are all talking about accessibility
97:50 - of modals
97:51 - so i'm gonna let that happen
97:54 - and
97:57 - type reset
97:59 - um okay these are check boxes
98:02 - so let me see what items i need in this
98:05 - form in the first place and put those
98:06 - items in the form
98:08 - and
98:09 - let me go to time entry
98:14 - um
98:16 - so eventually
98:18 - i'd like these
98:21 - to be automatic like there to be a timer
98:23 - in the app
98:25 - to start and stop like a little window
98:27 - that pops up in the corner of your
98:28 - desktop where you can start and stop
98:30 - your time
98:32 - but for right now it's manual entry so
98:34 - they're going to have to
98:36 - input a start time and put a stop time
98:39 - and then
98:42 - i want like a text field of any notes
98:46 - that they have and then there's going to
98:48 - be a foreign key
98:49 - relating a project to the time entry
98:51 - later
98:52 - but not right now so i basically need
98:54 - start stop and notes
98:58 - so i can get rid of the check boxes
99:01 - let me get rid of these
99:07 - um
99:08 - i can also get rid of
99:10 - this
99:13 - uh
99:14 - these
99:16 - drop down so now i just have one input
99:20 - which
99:24 - is going to be
99:26 - actually i need a date input so let me
99:28 - look that up
99:35 - okay
99:36 - oh cool
99:37 - so it's displaying now i do need this i
99:40 - forgot to do
99:41 - oh no i have a container
99:43 - um
99:46 - this is centered for some reason that
99:48 - text okay
99:50 - so i'm going to do
99:52 - um
99:55 - let's see
99:56 - okay so this isn't all in one i need to
99:59 - add
100:01 - another
100:03 - v row and then nest all these components
100:05 - so that i can have a v
100:07 - column here
100:10 - small
100:11 - i will do 6
100:13 - 6 columns wide
100:15 - and then offset small
100:19 - will be
100:21 - 12 columns wide
100:24 - and then
100:26 - all of this stuff
100:28 - will be nested inside
100:31 - and
100:33 - all of that
100:35 - so
100:37 - container okay so i'm going to indent
100:39 - these ones
100:41 - and it's going to be
100:43 - oops
100:47 - command
100:49 - okay and then here i'm going to
100:53 - uh wait
100:55 - didn't like that close the column and
100:57 - then close that row
101:00 - okay and now it should
101:02 - be more centered is it
101:07 - is it just catching up now or did i do
101:09 - something wrong
101:12 - because i have the rows inside of this
101:13 - column now
101:15 - which should be six columns wide on
101:17 - small and
101:19 - oh it's offset is 12 columns that's
101:21 - weird
101:22 - offset is three columns
101:27 - okay
101:29 - offset small yeah so i'm not sure why
101:32 - this isn't working right now i can
101:34 - compare it to my other component
101:37 - so i have oh
101:39 - this is so dumb okay so
101:41 - i'm in beautify mode still and when you
101:44 - use the beautified design library
101:47 - it um
101:48 - has v dash for everything
101:51 - so let me see if i can do
101:54 - b dash
101:56 - and yeah shouldn't have anything else so
101:58 - let me replace this with b dash
102:02 - and change that okay
102:04 - now
102:06 - okay now it works properly that's much
102:08 - better
102:11 - i don't know if anyone said that no
102:13 - everyone's kind of talking about
102:15 - modals and accessibility
102:18 - in the app
102:20 - okay
102:23 - so that's
102:25 - just okay for right now
102:27 - i don't have a lot of time so i'm gonna
102:30 - just finish adding the form inputs
102:34 - and
102:35 - let me look for
102:37 - the date
102:39 - date times here so
102:41 - date
102:44 - form
102:46 - date picker that looks promising
102:49 - b form date picker
102:54 - okay so it picks a date
103:00 - and then what about the time though
103:03 - is there a time picker
103:08 - uh some some ui libraries have it where
103:10 - you can have them both in one so you can
103:12 - choose the date
103:14 - and then you and then it
103:16 - brings up another box where you can
103:17 - choose the time
103:20 - um
103:22 - hmm
103:25 - i wonder if you can default to the
103:27 - current date
103:30 - button only mode
103:32 - okay i don't want that um so let me look
103:35 - real quick at a time picker and then see
103:37 - how i want to
103:40 - do this
103:42 - time selection widget okay so they are
103:45 - completely separate
103:47 - uh
103:49 - this is interesting what is this
103:53 - never seen something like this before
103:56 - if you need a time picker as a custom
103:59 - form control use the
104:01 - okay this is what i want then
104:03 - the b form time picker
104:07 - oh and then it pops up here so it's the
104:09 - same
104:11 - ui which is
104:13 - okay i guess
104:14 - and then can you type in here
104:17 - can i type
104:19 - oh no i type here right
104:21 - this is weird
104:26 - uh okay
104:27 - and then i guess they probably have
104:32 - oh wow
104:34 - a lot of options
104:36 - i guess they probably have
104:38 - our 12 okay so this toggles 24 hour
104:41 - versus 12 hour so that's good
104:44 - does anyone else think this time picker
104:46 - looks a little weird
104:49 - um
104:51 - but i'll go ahead and use it for now
104:53 - that's fine so let me go to the most
104:55 - basic example
105:00 - oh that's disable no it's not disabled
105:04 - um
105:04 - yeah let me get the date picker and time
105:07 - picker
105:11 - and
105:14 - expand this
105:17 - um
105:18 - [Music]
105:20 - so
105:22 - i'm actually going to get rid of this
105:26 - and inside here
105:28 - i'll put the time picker
105:31 - and
105:33 - i'll make that self-closing
105:36 - and then put it
105:39 - on multiple rows
105:47 - okay
105:48 - so v model will be
105:50 - wait
105:52 - uh
105:53 - form data
105:55 - dot
105:56 - start time
106:01 - or i should put start i guess
106:03 - because there's start and end for times
106:06 - and then there is
106:11 - um
106:14 - just one date because it won't go over
106:17 - into the next date so
106:19 - everything is separated by which day you
106:21 - worked on
106:22 - and
106:23 - yeah so if you need to go into the next
106:25 - day i guess it's going to
106:29 - not go over or should i like if you work
106:31 - from 11 p.m until 2 a.m
106:35 - should i have two different dates for
106:36 - that
106:39 - maybe i should
106:40 - if people want to work wonky hours
106:43 - that should be up to them
106:46 - your name so okay
106:49 - um so here
106:51 - i need to
106:52 - put start date
106:56 - and
107:00 - end
107:00 - date
107:05 - okay so now i need to add that date time
107:09 - form date picker
107:20 - ujs date object
107:22 - okay so jared's recommending view to
107:25 - date picker let me take a look at that
107:28 - um view to
107:31 - date picker
107:37 - view to date picker on npm
107:42 - let me go through mpm so i can find the
107:44 - official github
107:46 - for the project
107:48 - we have about 10 minutes left
107:51 - how's everyone doing what did you think
107:53 - about the desktop app today
107:56 - date picker
107:58 - oh this is interesting
108:00 - i can do date ranges
108:02 - i like that
108:06 - internationalization
108:08 - let me take a look
108:09 - so
108:11 - home page
108:14 - which is the repository
108:16 - but let me go there it's running a
108:18 - little bit slow
108:20 - all right
108:21 - so view to date picker
108:25 - so this doesn't do times but i can get
108:27 - the date range
108:30 - which is good
108:34 - there are i guess themes for it
108:38 - the props are documented that's good
108:44 - uh okay
108:47 - this is nice
108:49 - all right
108:51 - yes it does click the demo oh what demo
108:54 - is it this
108:58 - yeah must be this
109:04 - let's see
109:06 - oh it has time too
109:10 - oh i like i like this better than
109:14 - the bootstrap one with the arrows
109:17 - select week
109:20 - week 28 okay
109:23 - select date
109:27 - select month
109:30 - this is nice
109:31 - select year i might use this for other
109:33 - things in the app too
109:35 - select
109:37 - date time
109:40 - okay date time is what i want then
109:43 - select date time because i can select
109:45 - the date
109:46 - and the time for both the start and the
109:47 - end that's perfect thanks jared that's a
109:50 - good idea
109:51 - oh this isn't zoomed in so i don't know
109:53 - if you can see it but
109:55 - um
109:57 - okay and then i also have
110:00 - oh okay so this is date time range
110:05 - so
110:07 - let me pick a date
110:09 - and then
110:12 - an end date
110:14 - oh and then it says a time
110:18 - i don't know if i want these both in the
110:19 - same one
110:24 - okay
110:26 - but it's cool it lets you do the hours
110:28 - seconds everything
110:30 - hours minutes seconds
110:34 - um do i want these all in one or do i
110:37 - want
110:38 - two different boxes one for start and
110:40 - one for end
110:45 - okay
110:47 - so let me install this library for
110:49 - starters
110:52 - uh
110:55 - let's see
110:58 - install save view to date picker
111:01 - okay
111:02 - i'm gonna have to stop the server again
111:10 - all right
111:11 - so
111:14 - npm install view to date picker
111:18 - we have a couple minutes left
111:20 - so i'll have to pick back up on this
111:23 - uh next time
111:26 - we do a form for date and a form for
111:28 - time the news have computed to combine
111:30 - them into one
111:32 - date object i think i'm going to do them
111:35 - two separate ones so i'll store the
111:39 - i want the date and the time together
111:41 - but i want i don't want the start date
111:43 - and the end date to be in the same form
111:48 - basically
111:50 - oh i think uh youtube started lagging a
111:53 - little bit more
111:55 - toward the end
111:57 - so that must be
112:00 - about 20 seconds behind
112:03 - or 15 seconds maybe i don't know
112:07 - okay
112:09 - so
112:10 - i have nwjs hour tracking
112:14 - and now uh
112:17 - oh yeah let me start the server again so
112:19 - npm start
112:21 - i have that installed
112:23 - and i can start setting it
112:28 - up so i need to import the date picker
112:33 - register it as a component and i can
112:35 - just do this
112:36 - locally
112:38 - i guess it doesn't matter i can always
112:39 - do it
112:41 - globally as well
112:45 - okay
112:49 - there's my window
112:52 - add entry
112:56 - go to the add entry page
112:58 - and yeah now that i look at this again i
113:00 - really don't like this
113:02 - interface because i can't even type in
113:05 - here
113:06 - so i have to just keep clicking 30 times
113:09 - or click and hold yeah
113:14 - it's okay but i think it needs some
113:15 - improvement
113:16 - so i'm gonna get rid of these then these
113:19 - bootstrap
113:22 - form form picker time picker whatever
113:26 - get rid of those
113:29 - oh input group
113:30 - ids i shouldn't have
113:32 - the same ids multiple times
113:36 - label 4
113:39 - um
113:40 - yeah i don't have these yet
113:43 - but i will
113:45 - and now let me
113:49 - do
113:54 - uh date picker i need the css where
113:58 - okay import date picker import date
114:00 - picker css so i'm going to do these
114:06 - globally so let me go to my main.js file
114:12 - and
114:16 - import
114:17 - the date picker
114:23 - okay and now i need to do view dot use
114:29 - so
114:30 - let's see
114:32 - um
114:34 - oh after
114:36 - so view dot
114:40 - is it
114:41 - oh it's registering component yeah view
114:43 - dot component
114:46 - and then
114:49 - i guess i can
114:52 - what is it date dash picker yeah so it's
114:54 - the same thing so date
114:57 - dash picker
114:59 - and then so it's registered as date dash
115:01 - picker
115:02 - and now i need to pass in
115:05 - a component which is date picker
115:09 - okay so now i have it registered here as
115:12 - date picker
115:14 - and
115:15 - i can go to
115:17 - my form and i should be able to use it
115:20 - here oh yeah oh no i got the css that's
115:23 - good good good so now i can use
115:28 - this
115:29 - so let me just grab one let me grab the
115:31 - date time
115:32 - one
115:34 - and paste it here
115:39 - and okay let me make this self closing
115:41 - again
115:42 - so
115:47 - i'll do that oh yeah and v model so i'll
115:50 - do form data
115:52 - dot
115:54 - start date
116:01 - okay cool
116:05 - um it's not working because it's not
116:08 - remodeling to anything but
116:10 - the drop down works that's good so let
116:12 - me quickly add this to the
116:17 - to the

117:28 - i don't think i misspelled v model
117:31 - is this on twitch
117:33 - no no it's not this particular stream
117:36 - isn't so twitch doesn't let me stream as
117:39 - a twitch affiliate i can't stream on two
117:41 - platforms at the same time
117:44 - um
117:45 - but that's complicated anyway so but i
117:47 - do all of my coding live streams on my
117:50 - faraday academy
117:52 - twitch channel
117:56 - no yeah
117:58 - so
117:59 - um let me just see what the error is
118:01 - real quick let me look at the console
118:04 - cannot read property start date of
118:06 - undefined
118:08 - oh because i
118:10 - i spelled it form date okay
118:13 - form data
118:16 - uh
118:18 - and then let me do
118:20 - start

118:25 - and end
118:26 - date
118:29 - i don't know it'll be modeled there
118:31 - okay
118:32 - cool and so now i have my start date and
118:35 - my end date awesome
118:38 - submit and reset
118:40 - of course i don't have those hooked up
118:41 - to anything

118:51 - um except for
118:53 - afcc
118:54 - guest spots yeah exactly so all my other
118:58 - coding streams are on my twitch account

119:02 - on this account so like uh danny
119:05 - thompson he came on my channel the other
119:07 - day maybe you've seen him if you're
119:09 - around coding twitter and instagram he's
119:13 - a really great
119:14 - uh speaker coder all that stuff
119:18 - you can check in your view dev tools yes
119:20 - i will

119:59 - yeah this stream felt
120:02 - um
120:03 - a lot more like a real project than the
120:05 - other streams before i was just kind of
120:07 - building the free code camp projects
120:10 - which was also kind of cool because i
120:11 - built them five years ago and then to go
120:13 - back and build them in a new framework
120:16 - today
120:17 - that was that was cool for me anyway
120:22 - yeah thanks jared thanks anish
120:24 - thanks tom uh thanks sashi thanks
