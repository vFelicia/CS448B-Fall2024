00:07 - hi my name is luke siciliano i'm a web
00:10 - developer i'm also self-employed
00:12 - i've done a video before for free code
00:14 - camp on the topic of whether or not you
00:15 - should go the freelancer self-employment
00:17 - route after you're done learning how to
00:19 - code we're going to link to that video
00:20 - in the description below
00:23 - now assuming that you've decided hey i
00:26 - think i want to be a freelancer i think
00:27 - i'm going to start my own company i
00:28 - think i want to work for myself rock on
00:30 - good for you i think you should go for
00:32 - it i think you're going to find the
00:33 - experience incredibly rewarding both
00:34 - financially and personally
00:37 - with that being said there are a lot of
00:38 - things that come along with running your
00:40 - own business that can cause a lot of
00:42 - people to feel intimidated and that's
00:44 - the due to the fact that when you're
00:46 - working for yourself you have to deal
00:47 - with a lot of things that in the past an
00:49 - employer handled for you things such as
00:53 - how do i deal with health insurance
00:54 - vendors because when you've got a job
00:55 - you just sign up for the plan the
00:57 - employer gives you well now you've got
00:58 - to figure out where to get health
00:59 - insurance from
01:01 - things such as
01:02 - how do i pick a provider for my
01:04 - retirement account because again when
01:05 - you're employed your employer just you
01:08 - know says here's who we go through
01:09 - you're going to go through vanguard
01:10 - fidelity whatever and you just sign up
01:11 - for their plan
01:14 - of the things you have to start dealing
01:15 - with when you're self-employed
01:18 - perhaps the issue that intimidates
01:19 - entrepreneurs more than anything else is
01:21 - the topic of taxes
01:24 - you know people might be concerned about
01:26 - um how much am i going to be taxed on
01:28 - how do i pay my taxes during the course
01:30 - of the year how do i get money to the
01:31 - government so on so forth
01:33 - i am here to tell you that the issue of
01:35 - taxes which we're going to break down on
01:37 - all this in a second is not something
01:39 - that you need to be intimidated over and
01:42 - you certainly don't let it
01:44 - need to let it intimidate you to the
01:45 - point that you decide not to start your
01:47 - own company okay
01:49 - you've just learned how to code you can
01:51 - learn how to deal with these kinds of
01:52 - issues so just understand
01:55 - working for yourself means continuous
01:57 - learning you're going to learn how to
01:58 - deal with issues and you're going to be
01:59 - successful all right so do not let these
02:01 - kinds of issues especially taxes
02:03 - intimidate you out of working for
02:05 - yourself
02:06 - so in this video what i'm going to do is
02:09 - talk about three things number one i'm
02:11 - going to talk about
02:13 - what it is you actually are responsible
02:15 - to pay taxes on uh what's what's your
02:18 - income when you're self-employed i'm
02:20 - going to talk about how you can
02:21 - structure your business
02:22 - to manage your tax obligations and then
02:25 - i'm going to provide some kind of basics
02:27 - that we do in our business um you know
02:30 - to help streamline some of these issues
02:32 - one thing i'm going to really stress
02:34 - before i get into this is the fact that
02:36 - i am not a licensed tax professional i
02:38 - am not holding myself out as one
02:40 - um i am not holding myself as any kind
02:43 - of a financial advisor these are things
02:45 - you really need to talk to a lawyer
02:46 - about talk to a tax accountant about so
02:48 - on and so forth to figure out what's
02:50 - best for your particular situation what
02:52 - i'm doing in this video is sharing my
02:53 - knowledge with you and explaining to you
02:54 - what what we do in our business
02:58 - so with that being said let's look at
03:01 - what it is you actually pay taxes on in
03:03 - other words what's your income when
03:05 - you're self-employed
03:07 - a lot of people make the mistake of
03:08 - thinking that everything that comes into
03:10 - the business
03:11 - is their income so in other words
03:13 - person one writes you a check to build a
03:15 - website person two
03:17 - writes you
03:18 - uh
03:19 - pays you cash i should say to build an
03:22 - app uh person uh number three
03:26 - uh you know
03:27 - get pays you on a credit card to build
03:29 - some local software that they want to
03:32 - run all those things come into your
03:34 - business that is not
03:36 - your income that's your revenue
03:38 - everything that comes into the business
03:39 - that anyone pays you is what's called
03:40 - your revenue so
03:42 - your revenue is everything that comes in
03:45 - you have expenses
03:47 - which are everything you pay out to run
03:49 - the business
03:51 - maybe you had to write a check to amazon
03:52 - web services maybe you had to rent an
03:54 - office maybe you had to pay the
03:55 - utilities at that office that's the
03:57 - money you spent to make money so
03:59 - everything that comes in is your revenue
04:02 - minus everything that goes out is your
04:05 - expenses and after that you get what's
04:07 - called your net income okay so under our
04:10 - little scenario here let's say during
04:12 - the course of a year you brought in 120
04:14 - 000 in revenue 10 000 a month
04:17 - again building websites building apps
04:19 - whatever
04:20 - during the course of the year your
04:22 - business paid out twenty thousand
04:23 - dollars you had to rent an office you
04:24 - paid amazon web services uh
04:27 - you know you had to pay utilities at the
04:29 - office you know things of that nature
04:31 - so you brought in 120 000 in revenue you
04:33 - paid out 20 000 in expenses that leaves
04:36 - you net income of 100 000
04:39 - so at the end of the year when you're
04:40 - reporting your income to the irs
04:43 - this is the number you report as income
04:46 - one hundred thousand dollars and this is
04:48 - the amount that you will be taxed on so
04:51 - depending how you structure things a
04:53 - certain percentage of this is what
04:54 - you're going to pay to the government
04:56 - you are not going to pay a percentage of
04:58 - your revenue you're going to pay a
04:58 - percentage of your net income generally
05:00 - speaking okay
05:02 - now
05:04 - how much of this 100 000
05:06 - you pay to the government
05:08 - and how you pay it to the government
05:11 - during the course of the year
05:13 - um will depend on how you structure your
05:15 - business
05:16 - so now let's take a look at three ways
05:18 - that you can structure your business
05:19 - there's a lot more than this but for the
05:20 - purposes of this video i'm gonna go over
05:23 - the three that
05:24 - if i had to guess are the most common
05:26 - for uh
05:28 - freelancers small entrepreneurs things
05:30 - of that nature
05:32 - one is a sole proprietorship i've got
05:33 - solep for that
05:35 - one is an llc which is a limited
05:37 - liability company
05:39 - and the third is to choose to tax
05:40 - yourself as an s corporation or an s
05:42 - corp i'm going to talk about each of
05:44 - these in turn
05:46 - sole proprietorship means you don't go
05:48 - out and start a separate business in
05:50 - other words you're doing this as an
05:52 - individual you don't go out and start an
05:54 - entity you don't go start a company um
05:56 - you know
05:57 - so in other words instead of starting an
05:58 - llc or an s corporation i just go out
06:01 - and get a business license and i start
06:03 - building websites and doing these things
06:05 - for people individually and then they
06:07 - write a check you know directly to me
06:09 - and then that all goes into my revenue
06:13 - so that's a sole proprietorship it's not
06:15 - a separate entity
06:16 - you know you're just handling things
06:18 - directly
06:19 - and at the end of the year you're if
06:21 - you're a sole proprietor you're going to
06:23 - attach what's called a schedule cd or
06:24 - tax return and that schedule c will
06:27 - report your income or your revenue your
06:29 - expenses and the 100 000
06:32 - in income and what this person will want
06:34 - to do since they're not getting a
06:36 - paycheck they're self-employed
06:38 - is every quarter they're going to send
06:39 - some money in to the irs
06:42 - and then that's going to be the same as
06:43 - having or in lieu of i should say having
06:46 - withholdings from a paycheck
06:48 - and then you make those estimated
06:49 - quarterly tax payments to make sure at
06:51 - the end of the year you don't get hit
06:52 - with a huge uh tax obligation because of
06:55 - the fact that you have income from that
06:56 - so sole proprietor
06:59 - again just to be a little repetitive
07:01 - not a separate entity just an individual
07:03 - essentially an individual for business
07:05 - license money comes into the business or
07:07 - i should say into them personally
07:09 - every quarter they send an estimated tax
07:11 - payment
07:12 - into the irs at the end of the year they
07:15 - report their income on their schedule c
07:17 - on their personal tax return
07:20 - uh if their estimated tax payments cover
07:22 - their obligations and they don't owe
07:24 - anything else if they overpaid their tax
07:26 - obligations they'll get a little bit of
07:27 - a refund if they underpaid they have to
07:29 - write the irs a check that's how sole
07:31 - proprietor works
07:33 - another option is an llc
07:36 - this is stands for limited liability
07:38 - company as opposed to a sole
07:39 - proprietorship this is an actual
07:41 - separate entity you have started a
07:42 - separate entity a separate business
07:44 - and what happens is the llc you start
07:47 - the llc the llc gets a business license
07:50 - all this revenue comes into the llc
07:53 - in a bank account in the llc's name all
07:56 - these expenses get paid out
07:58 - of the bank account that's in the llc's
08:00 - name
08:01 - at the end of the day the money that's
08:03 - left over gets distributed to the owners
08:05 - the owners write themselves a check they
08:07 - call it a distribution and that's how
08:08 - they get their money
08:09 - from the
08:10 - business the llc
08:13 - does not pay any taxes okay
08:16 - um at the end of the year
08:18 - the owner is going to get what's called
08:20 - a k1
08:21 - it's a tax form the owner is going to
08:23 - get a k1 from the llc saying
08:25 - llc had 120 000 in revenue llc had 20
08:28 - 000
08:29 - in expenses
08:31 - llc profits are 100 000 the individual
08:35 - owner will pay taxes on the 100 000 on
08:38 - their personal tax return
08:41 - same as with a sole proprietorship if
08:43 - you're going the llc route
08:45 - what you want to do is send in quarterly
08:47 - tax payments to the irs so at the end of
08:49 - the year you don't just have to write a
08:51 - huge check for your taxes and it also
08:53 - helps you avoid
08:54 - uh getting hit with any penalties
08:56 - so that's an llc
08:59 - the third thing you can do is choose to
09:00 - be taxed as an s corp uh this is what
09:03 - we've done
09:04 - in our business now an s corp is another
09:06 - form of a company but what we've done is
09:08 - we have started an llc
09:11 - and there's a form we can you can file
09:13 - the irs
09:15 - link to in the comment form below
09:17 - where you are telling the irs
09:20 - that we have an llc
09:22 - for tax purposes please consider us an s
09:25 - corp so in other words for all legal
09:26 - purposes we're an llc but as far as the
09:28 - irs is concerned
09:30 - we're an s corporation
09:33 - an s corporation works a little
09:34 - different do you remember with these i
09:36 - was talking about how you just
09:38 - distribute money to yourself
09:39 - as the owner
09:41 - well with an s corp
09:43 - if you're owning the business you're
09:44 - also an employee of the business so you
09:47 - set up payroll just as you would for any
09:49 - employee you're required to pay yourself
09:51 - what's called a reasonable salary and
09:53 - then you any profits on top of the
09:55 - salary you distribute to yourself so in
09:58 - other words
10:00 - let's say
10:01 - you know all after expenses company
10:04 - brings in a hundred thousand dollars
10:07 - let's say an average reasonable salary
10:10 - for a web developer in my area is sixty
10:12 - thousand
10:13 - so
10:14 - you know i run payroll just like i would
10:16 - with any other employee and i pay myself
10:18 - a salary of sixty thousand dollars
10:20 - because i'm required to pay
10:21 - a reasonable salary of myself
10:24 - taxes get withheld out of my paycheck
10:26 - just like they would for any other
10:28 - employee
10:29 - and then after that sixty thousand
10:31 - dollar salary i've got forty thousand
10:32 - dollars in profits left over because a
10:34 - hundred minus sixty is forty
10:36 - i take that forty thousand dollars as a
10:39 - distribution
10:40 - so just like here and here
10:43 - total i'm getting a hundred thousand
10:44 - dollars it's just that here you got
10:46 - distributed a hundred thousand dollars
10:48 - directly here you got distributed a
10:49 - hundred thousand dollars directly here
10:51 - you got sixty thousand dollars in salary
10:54 - and a forty thousand dollar
10:56 - distribution
10:58 - now again this is what we do in our
11:01 - business and i know
11:02 - hearing what i just said this probably
11:04 - sounds way more complicated than these
11:06 - so you're probably wondering why would
11:08 - you want to own the business and be an
11:10 - employee of the business and deal with
11:12 - payroll and give yourself more headaches
11:14 - okay and i understand why people feel
11:15 - that way
11:17 - here's why you do that
11:19 - when you get a paycheck from an employer
11:22 - you are
11:23 - used to federal income tax being held
11:25 - out
11:26 - you also see social security medicare
11:28 - medicaid uh fica those kinds of things
11:31 - being held out of there let's call those
11:33 - things employment taxes social security
11:35 - medicare medicaid those are your
11:37 - employment taxes
11:38 - well when you work for yourself
11:42 - because you're not getting a paycheck
11:44 - no one's withholding anything from your
11:46 - paycheck
11:47 - so i talked about with these
11:50 - you're going to send estimated quarterly
11:51 - payments to the irs
11:53 - but those estimated quarterly payments
11:55 - only apply to your federal income taxes
11:57 - they don't apply to social security
11:58 - medicare medicaid
12:00 - fica employment taxes which is what
12:02 - we're calling them
12:05 - so at the end of the year
12:07 - you're going to have to pay what's
12:08 - called a self-employment tax on top of
12:10 - your federal income tax and your
12:13 - self-employment tax is
12:15 - the equivalent of those employment taxes
12:18 - social security medicare medicaid so on
12:20 - so forth
12:21 - so
12:22 - sole proprietor and an llc
12:25 - if you make a hundred thousand dollars
12:28 - on top of your federal income tax
12:30 - you're going to pay
12:32 - employment tax or self-employment tax
12:35 - on the hundred thousand dollars which is
12:38 - about 6.2 percent
12:40 - so in other words
12:42 - after these people have paid their
12:43 - federal income taxes
12:45 - they're going to pay another 6.2 percent
12:47 - or in this case six thousand two hundred
12:49 - dollars to the government on top of
12:50 - their federal income taxes
12:52 - to make up for the fact that they didn't
12:54 - pay in the social security medicare
12:55 - medicaid during the year they're going
12:56 - to pay self-employment tax
12:59 - so that's 6 200 bucks
13:01 - on a hundred thousand dollars
13:03 - now let's go down to my scenario again
13:05 - that i gave down here
13:07 - excuse me
13:08 - remember i said you're an employee of
13:10 - the business and you also own the
13:11 - business
13:13 - well when you're an employee
13:14 - and you get a paycheck that means
13:16 - federal income tax gets held out
13:18 - social security medicare medicaid gets
13:20 - held out
13:21 - so
13:22 - that social security medicare medicaid
13:23 - is six point two percent the same as the
13:25 - employment tax that these people pay
13:27 - so on that sixty thousand dollar salary
13:29 - again we said you're getting a sixty
13:31 - thousand dollar salary in a forty
13:32 - thousand dollar distribution out of the
13:34 - hundred
13:35 - on that sixty thousand dollar salary
13:38 - you'll pay the six point two percent
13:40 - employment tax
13:42 - the thing about an s corp
13:44 - is that that forty thousand dollar
13:46 - distribution that we got on top of
13:50 - uh our sixty thousand dollar salary
13:53 - you pay federal income tax on the forty
13:55 - thousand dollars
13:57 - but that forty thousand dollar
13:58 - distribution in other words anything
14:00 - beyond your salary
14:02 - is not subject to the self-employment
14:04 - tax
14:06 - so in other words you do not pay the six
14:07 - point two percent self-employment tax on
14:09 - that forty percent profit
14:11 - okay or forty thousand dollar i should
14:13 - say profit
14:14 - which under our hypothetical right here
14:17 - would save you call it twenty five
14:18 - hundred bucks six point two percent of
14:20 - that forty thousand dollar profit profit
14:22 - is roughly twenty five hundred dollars
14:25 - so in other words
14:27 - the sole proprietor pays 6.2 percent
14:31 - employment tax
14:33 - on their entire hundred thousand plus
14:35 - federal income tax on a hundred thousand
14:38 - the llc pays 6.2 percent employment tax
14:41 - and federal income tax
14:43 - on a hundred thousand
14:44 - the s corp owner
14:47 - pays federal income tax
14:49 - on the full hundred thousand because
14:51 - they took sixty thousand salary and
14:53 - they've got forty thousand profit they
14:54 - pay which is a hundred thousand they pay
14:56 - federal income tax on all that but they
14:58 - only pay the employment tax on the
15:00 - salary portion and the profit does not
15:03 - get hit with that 6.2 percent tax so if
15:06 - you were to add up all the obligations
15:08 - at the end of the day
15:09 - this person is going to pay a little bit
15:11 - less in taxes
15:12 - than these people so there are some tax
15:14 - advantages to doing an s corp which is
15:16 - why you're going to go through the extra
15:18 - rigamarole that i talked about a minute
15:19 - ago of setting yourself up as an
15:21 - employee
15:22 - so on so forth
15:25 - now a couple of things about this is you
15:28 - have to pay yourself a reasonable salary
15:30 - you know you know you can't pay yourself
15:31 - five bucks or something like that you
15:33 - have to pay yourself a reasonable salary
15:34 - talk to an accountant talk to your cpa
15:36 - about what is a reasonable salary for
15:38 - you to uh be paying yourself
15:41 - that's issue number one
15:43 - issue number two
15:44 - is
15:45 - that
15:46 - there's some complications that come
15:48 - along with an s corp in the sense that
15:50 - yes you know you have to
15:53 - pay yourself a salary and manage all
15:54 - that
15:56 - don't make that complicated sign up for
15:58 - a payroll service to manage that for you
16:01 - we use uh
16:02 - intuit payroll services in our business
16:04 - there's a lot of different payroll
16:05 - services like adp and whatnot they will
16:08 - if you sign up for your full service
16:10 - options
16:11 - they will manage uh the withholdings for
16:13 - you they will like file your different
16:15 - state and local forms for you so on so
16:17 - forth so you're not buried in paperwork
16:19 - all the time
16:20 - so while setting yourself up as an
16:23 - employee may sound complicated
16:26 - using a service a payroll service to
16:28 - manage that for you actually makes it
16:30 - pretty simple i mean again we use intuit
16:31 - merchant services i would say at the end
16:33 - of the day
16:34 - it's actually pretty seamless
16:36 - having ourselves set up as employees of
16:39 - the company and we save money in taxes
16:41 - at the end of the year you know because
16:42 - of it
16:44 - so
16:45 - again what we do in our business is an
16:46 - llc with an s corp election that's what
16:49 - we do in our business but what's best
16:51 - for your particular situation is
16:52 - something that
16:53 - you need to talk to a lawyer or an
16:55 - accountant about
16:58 - one last thing i want to close on with
17:01 - this is the topic of your expenses
17:05 - one mistake i see a lot of entrepreneurs
17:08 - making
17:09 - is
17:10 - they
17:11 - run the risk of under reporting their
17:15 - expenses
17:17 - there are a lot of things that are
17:18 - expenses for your business that you
17:19 - might not realize
17:20 - uh
17:21 - if you
17:23 - leave your office to drive to a business
17:25 - meeting your mileage might be an expense
17:28 - if you go out to a business dinner with
17:31 - other developers
17:32 - and for work purposes
17:34 - it's possible that the cost of the meal
17:37 - might be a business expense there are
17:39 - lots of things if you have to buy a
17:40 - computer for the office that might be
17:43 - a business expense there are lots of
17:45 - things that business ex that are
17:46 - business expenses that people say hey
17:49 - i'm not sure if this is an expense or
17:50 - not
17:51 - well at the end of the year what those
17:53 - people do is they might have a stack of
17:56 - things that they're not sure if their
17:57 - expenses
17:58 - so they don't give them to the
17:59 - accountant
18:00 - well if the accountant doesn't know
18:02 - about those expenditures
18:04 - they're certainly never going to be
18:05 - counted as expenses on your tax return
18:07 - right
18:08 - so what i would suggest doing is save
18:11 - everything you've got to document your
18:12 - expenses is you know you can't just say
18:14 - my expenses are x you have to have
18:16 - documentation of them
18:18 - save all your receipts document
18:19 - everything
18:21 - er on the side when you're talking about
18:22 - your expenses er on the side of saying
18:25 - something is an expense
18:27 - and at the end of the year give
18:28 - everything to your accountant
18:30 - and have your accountant tell you
18:31 - whether or not something is an expense
18:33 - don't make the mistake of thinking
18:35 - i'll just assume this is not an expense
18:38 - assume it might be and ask your
18:39 - accountant okay because you want to
18:42 - capture all those expenses that you
18:44 - possibly can because again if your
18:46 - revenue is 120
18:48 - and your expenses are 20 you pay taxes
18:51 - on a hundred thousand dollars
18:53 - well let's say under this scenario
18:56 - there were ten thousand dollars in
18:57 - things of in potential expenses that you
19:00 - missed
19:01 - and you didn't give your to your
19:03 - accountant so that means you brought in
19:04 - 120
19:06 - you only expense 10
19:08 - so you pay taxes on 110 000 in other
19:11 - words your tax bill is bigger record
19:13 - everything give it to your accountant
19:15 - and let your accountant tell you
19:17 - whether or not uh something is an
19:19 - expense i'm not saying to just put
19:20 - everything on your tax return as an
19:22 - expense i'm saying ask your accountant
19:23 - about it that's
19:24 - the one last piece of advice i will give
19:27 - now we all know there was a big tax
19:30 - change
19:32 - recently and that the tax code is
19:34 - different for 2018
19:36 - prior to doing this video i have talked
19:39 - to the cpa that does our taxes
19:42 - and he has um
19:44 - you know what he told me
19:46 - and again this is not advice to you at
19:48 - all what he told me is that this is
19:50 - still the way to go he is advising us
19:53 - to continue to go this way that i've
19:55 - just talked about with our taxes even
19:57 - after the change
19:58 - in uh
20:00 - the recent changes i should say in the
20:02 - tax code
20:03 - so

20:14 - business okay they're just not get a
20:16 - good cpa
