00:07 - hey everybody is Jessie and today we're
00:13 - going to keep working on our react
00:14 - project that we've been working on for
00:17 - this is day 19 so I've just been working
00:24 - on the video page so I have the the
00:30 - proper embed codes now for all of these
00:34 - videos and I noticed something when I
00:37 - was doing this that I want to correct
00:39 - something that I said earlier so I think
00:44 - on Monday I had noticed something odd
00:47 - about what the way the float X class was
00:50 - being applied and I think I figured it
00:55 - out and whatever I said about it on
00:57 - Monday I don't think it was correct I
01:01 - can't remember exactly what I said but
01:05 - you know I just noticed it so I didn't
01:07 - have time to go back and and watch the
01:09 - video and see what I said but but check
01:12 - this out so right now I have let me show
01:17 - you so on this h2 at the top I have the
01:20 - float X class on the container div but
01:24 - then for these h3s oh yeah
01:28 - for these age 3s I have float X right on
01:30 - the h3
01:31 - I think that I said that float X was not
01:35 - being applied directly to the H tags if
01:38 - I put it on there and that's not correct
01:40 - I'm not I'm not exactly sure what I was
01:42 - looking at on Monday when I thought that
01:45 - but that's obviously not correct and
01:47 - I'll show you I'll show you why
01:51 - so let's take a look at this this h2 so
01:55 - we can see the float X classes are
01:59 - showing up and at first it looks like
02:03 - all right none of them are there but
02:08 - once you shrink that down it's obvious
02:11 - that this got smaller so let me make it
02:15 - bigger and smaller one more time
02:20 - so definitely smaller I mean we can even
02:24 - double check that I'll make this a bit
02:25 - bigger for you all be able to see those
02:28 - those more than a bit it's a lot bigger
02:31 - I let's stir this up there we go all
02:38 - right so we can check out the computed
02:41 - styles and it will tell us exactly I
02:45 - mean I I think I can tell just looking
02:47 - at so that's about 28 pixels there
02:49 - almost there
02:50 - 29 and we make it bigger now we're up to
02:57 - 40 right so it's definitely acting like
03:00 - the flow text should act so if we check
03:08 - sit still
03:14 - that's odd so for whatever reason I'm
03:23 - not sure why but for whatever reason it
03:26 - just shows up in dev tools that has
03:29 - crossed that and I I think I might have
03:31 - mentioned that that's possible that was
03:32 - the case before and then obviously
03:36 - what's happening with these is it's
03:39 - actually overriding the default H tag
03:43 - styles so if I were to put flow text
03:48 - directly on this H tag it would become
03:51 - the same size as this so this h2 would
03:54 - be the same size as the h3 so if you
03:59 - want to keep the H styles but then
04:03 - somehow still have it be responsive
04:06 - which like I said from dev tools I can't
04:10 - really see it maybe you all can see
04:11 - something and I'm just missing it since
04:14 - I'm trying to look at it now live but
04:18 - kind of a I don't know just a small
04:21 - difference but it it makes a big
04:23 - difference when you when you view it you
04:25 - know the h2 is definitely a lot bigger
04:28 - if you put that on the container div so
04:30 - for this page I'm gonna keep it as it is
04:33 - now because I like the size for these H
04:38 - threes I think the H tag is the correct
04:41 - tag to use in this case these are
04:44 - definitely headings but I like the size
04:49 - that the that it's getting now from flow
04:53 - text even when you shrink it down I like
04:55 - that size but I don't like this size for
04:58 - this age too
04:59 - so we're gonna leave it like this the
05:03 - only thing I may change at some point is
05:05 - the font weight to make it the same as
05:07 - this but just just wanted to add that
05:10 - correction to what I had said earlier
05:15 - and so that's out of the way let me say
05:18 - hi to everybody I see some of you on the
05:21 - latch
05:21 - Sana's back awesome so I hope you had a
05:26 - good time on on holiday and where was
05:31 - your in Greece right so anyway that's
05:36 - cool so for everyone watching later on
05:39 - or if you can't see the live chat
05:40 - susanna who was frequently in the live
05:43 - chat hasn't been here for the last two
05:44 - weeks because she was on vacation on
05:50 - holiday so welcome back it's good to be
05:54 - back
05:55 - I do have the secondary stream going on
05:58 - Instagram so if you're on Instagram you
06:00 - can check me out the my username is in
06:04 - the description to this video if you're
06:07 - checking this out on the Instagram live
06:10 - stream you can see the code for what I'm
06:14 - working on on a free code camp YouTube
06:17 - channel and that'll still be available
06:20 - even afterwards as a recording on
06:24 - YouTube and on Instagram the recording
06:27 - will be available for 24 hours
06:29 - afterwards alright so let's get started
06:33 - I'm thinking today just to give you a
06:36 - timeframe will code for about an hour
06:39 - and then then we'll go to Question and
06:44 - Answer we'll try to keep it under an
06:46 - hour and a half for this session let's
06:52 - see I don't think there's any other kind
06:56 - of announcements or things to get out of
06:58 - the way I did have some pool requests so
07:03 - let me show you a little bit about
07:05 - what's changed so everyone's up to speed
07:07 - we have I think visibly I don't think
07:13 - there's anything visibly that's happened
07:15 - so we're just gonna check out the code
07:17 - and the pool requests
07:25 - yeah let me let me just bring the pull
07:28 - request over to keep it straight in my
07:31 - mind so we did three yeah I pulled in
07:36 - three full requests this morning
07:37 - so yeah it was this one
07:44 - 43 44 and 46 so we have a readme file
07:53 - now that is not just the create react
07:57 - app readme which is awesome so thanks
07:59 - for that so let me show you so I want to
08:08 - give credit I'm trying to infer there
08:16 - there we go so Cathal thank you for
08:20 - contributing so this is the first
08:21 - contribution to this repository really
08:25 - appreciate it
08:26 - Thanks so I wanted to put put your
08:28 - profile up there and give you proper
08:32 - credit for that and so we also had pool
08:38 - requests from Sebastian and one from
08:43 - Patrick so Sebastian added react helmet
08:46 - and I it can do more than what we're
08:51 - using it for right now but what what
08:55 - Sebastian added was the ability for us
08:57 - to change the title tag for each page so
09:01 - before it just said resource center no
09:03 - matter what view Iran now it says
09:07 - whatever the title of the page is and
09:10 - then I think we have the - and then
09:12 - resource center so you can check that
09:15 - out of course on on github if you want
09:20 - to see more of the code and then Patrick
09:22 - refactored that generic card component
09:25 - that we've been working on so you know
09:30 - this has been this has been kind of cool
09:33 - component because it's gone through a
09:34 - lot of changes since we first had
09:38 - and it just keeps getting better so
09:39 - Patrick added debounce so brought that
09:43 - in from lodash and we've seen that
09:45 - before in our last project we use that
09:47 - with our live search feature so we're
09:56 - using that now for for our depth right
10:00 - so our mouse mouse overs to get that car
10:04 - give the car the hover effect
10:07 - we're also I mentioned this on Monday
10:11 - that it would be nice to have was to
10:13 - open external links in a new tab so
10:17 - we're checking here to see if the link
10:21 - starts with the slash which means it
10:25 - would be an internal link otherwise
10:27 - we're going to treat it as an external
10:28 - link and then in that case if it's
10:33 - external we had target blank which will
10:34 - open it in a new window if its internal
10:37 - we leave that off so it'll just stay
10:39 - within the same window so really good
10:43 - that's good thinking to check link zero
10:48 - so the first position of the link to
10:52 - check for that slash that's that's
10:53 - really cool kind of a nice like simple
10:58 - way to do that so I really like that so
11:03 - anyway thank you to everyone who
11:06 - submitted pool requests and if I'm
11:09 - missing something in your pool request I
11:11 - apologize but I just tried to kind of
11:16 - sum up what each one was about as
11:19 - quickly as I could and now let's let's
11:27 - move on so I just let me make sure that
11:30 - I committed those last changes I think I
11:33 - did yeah I did commit them but I don't
11:38 - think I pushed them yet to get up so
11:42 - just so you all can see everything that
11:47 - is up to date as possible a wolf
11:55 - alright awesome and I think the only
12:03 - significant thing that I've done is I
12:05 - updated a few packages a few NPM
12:08 - packages so I was getting let me see
12:14 - so I manually updated yarn because I had
12:17 - a version that kept trying to do like
12:18 - this auto update and it just wasn't
12:20 - working so I looked it up and evidently
12:23 - you have to manually update so the auto
12:25 - update feature just hasn't been working
12:28 - for a while so I did that and then I
12:30 - started getting errors because I said it
12:33 - couldn't find node SAS so I upgraded the
12:36 - notes that's packaged and then it worked
12:38 - not exactly sure what the problem was it
12:41 - could be that somehow that package got
12:43 - in this place delete it I don't really
12:46 - know but if you're having some error
12:48 - like that upgrade the node SAS package
12:51 - and it should work also upgraded the
12:55 - reacts let's see react scripts that's
13:04 - what it's called so I can't even find
13:09 - where it is react scripts here we go so
13:12 - upgraded react scripts so one version up
13:16 - so that version came out I think last
13:19 - week sometime in the beginning of August
13:21 - and I so decided to upgrade to that my
13:26 - main reason other than just it's good to
13:28 - be up-to-date my main reason was I'm
13:29 - still I'm considering ejecting for the
13:34 - the pull request that we had went over
13:36 - on Monday so got a much better
13:40 - explanation so check out that pull
13:43 - request I believe it was 42 for I think
13:48 - there's only one or two pull requests
13:50 - that are still open right now so it's
13:52 - one of those but it's the one that had a
13:55 - lot of changes one of which being it
13:59 - ejected create react app
14:01 - in order to do some cool stuff with our
14:04 - loading SAS so I do like that so in case
14:09 - I go with that and I do eject I'd like
14:11 - to have everything as up-to-date as
14:13 - possible before I object the jack so
14:15 - that was kind of in preparation for that
14:17 - but there's since we've done so much in
14:21 - the last few days there's a lot of merge
14:24 - conflicts now so we'll see what kind see
14:28 - how it goes all right so we need to
14:34 - finish up with this this layout stuff so
14:37 - this page is good so we're working on
14:42 - posters I put in the correct links and
14:48 - so this page is pretty much it's it's
14:51 - finished it does look kind of bare
14:56 - excuse me it's nice so this does look a
15:01 - little bit better so I may put in those
15:03 - font icons like I have in the current
15:08 - version of this which if I can find it
15:11 - I'll show you all yeah so the current
15:19 - version has these font icons kind of
15:23 - makes it a little bit less plain so we
15:28 - may go with these because I mean ice if
15:32 - I had started with this maybe it
15:34 - wouldn't look so plain but since we're
15:36 - comparing it it definitely could use
15:40 - something so we may add those in at some
15:45 - point but we've already gone over adding
15:48 - in thawing icons in react with material
15:52 - UI so not not really gonna do that right
15:56 - now so I guess the next thing that we
15:58 - can do is add let's see so we've gone
16:03 - through home logos posters literature
16:07 - okay so the only section that we've
16:09 - really not put in what we need to is a
16:13 - service request form section so it looks
16:17 - like it's it's ready but at least
16:20 - obviously we need to change these but in
16:25 - the main the live version of this when
16:30 - we click on the service request form it
16:35 - shows us the Planning guide first so
16:38 - that's what we're gonna that's what
16:40 - we're gonna do at first I guess I think
16:45 - it would be more user friendly to just
16:48 - link to the planning guide here like
16:49 - would like we're doing down here but my
16:56 - my bosses wanted to show up before you
17:01 - even get to this so I I did add this
17:04 - skip to form in there so it makes it a
17:07 - bit easier for users so I think we're
17:10 - gonna stick with the way that my bosses
17:12 - wanted it and then maybe bring up the
17:16 - neck when we need about this I'll bring
17:18 - up maybe skipping to that just so that
17:22 - we don't have to make people you know go
17:23 - through this every time so let's get
17:27 - this on the page and I'd like to combine
17:30 - some of this it's gonna be a bit more
17:35 - scrolling but I think more scrolling is
17:38 - better than more clicking let me know
17:39 - what you think about that but to me it's
17:42 - it just seems a bit easier to have
17:47 - people scroll the only downside is it
17:49 - will it will seem like there's more text
17:52 - on the page because there will be so you
17:55 - know if you have to click each each view
17:58 - only as a small amount of text if I
18:00 - combined that all into one I don't want
18:04 - it to be overwhelming so if it does look
18:06 - overwhelming then maybe we'll split it
18:13 - up again but I'd like to see what it
18:15 - would look like if it were all on the
18:17 - same
18:20 - all right so let's do that now I believe
18:22 - I've created the page
18:25 - let's see use planning guide okay so we
18:35 - have the planning guide page
18:44 - and we're basically just going to need a
18:48 - card actually we talked about this
18:51 - didn't we I think we talked about this
18:53 - before that we may try to do this
18:58 - without cards and I think we had some
19:03 - mixed opinions about that as to whether
19:06 - or not we should do it with or without
19:07 - cards you know how that looked so I
19:11 - think it looks nice like this but at
19:15 - first I do I kind of want to see what it
19:18 - looks like
19:19 - without being in a card especially since
19:24 - we're gonna put it all on the page it's
19:26 - gonna be quite a lot it's that would be
19:28 - a very long card so let's try it first
19:34 - we can always wrap it in a card later on
19:38 - that won't really be difficult if we
19:41 - decide that we want that so for now we
19:48 - have so we have our H make sure we're
19:55 - not linking to this so let me see what
19:58 - are we calling this planning guide the
20:01 - links should be just planning guides so
20:02 - let's go there so we can see what's
20:04 - going on when we change things all right
20:11 - yeah so it's just really basic
20:14 - let's build out this page a bit more so
20:20 - let's start with the container div oops
20:26 - class name
20:34 - container
20:38 - and
20:41 - we may want to
20:54 - actually I was thinking that we might
20:56 - want to pull in the vertical alignment
20:59 - but this is going to be so big we won't
21:02 - we really won't need it so I think we'll
21:05 - be fine with the container div inside
21:07 - that container we're gonna put a row
21:13 - actually this is going to be if you're
21:15 - kind of a beginner in in reactor
21:19 - front-end development in general this
21:22 - might not be a bad livestream for you
21:25 - I know occasionally beginners ask me
21:27 - will you know will I be able to follow
21:30 - this and sometimes the answer is
21:33 - probably no you know maybe if we're
21:35 - working on some stuff with Express
21:40 - sometimes that's a little bit more
21:42 - difficult to follow if you're not used
21:45 - to it but this is gonna be a lot of
21:46 - basic you know layout so we are using
21:49 - the materialized CSS grid system so
21:53 - that's why we're doing this in this
21:55 - specific way if you're familiar with
22:01 - bootstrap then materialized CSS is
22:07 - basically does the same thing as
22:09 - bootstrap but with the material design
22:11 - style
22:20 - all right so we have this now and we're
22:23 - gonna put that h1 here I think we have
22:28 - been we've been doing h2s the let me do
22:35 - an h2 for now I'm not super worried
22:41 - about the H tags if I were making a site
22:44 - that I really wanted to worry about SEO
22:47 - search engine optimization I might give
22:49 - more thought to the tags the header tags
22:53 - and what was in them but this site does
22:56 - not need to be SEO friendly it's an
22:59 - internal site I actually would prefer if
23:02 - it didn't show up in any search engines
23:04 - so which is also why we're not worrying
23:08 - about server-side rendering not now
23:12 - search engines some search engines may
23:15 - be able to render this and all right but
23:18 - if we're pulling data from an API which
23:20 - at this point we're not but it's not out
23:22 - of the question at some point to do that
23:24 - then basically your content would be
23:28 - invisible to search engines because they
23:30 - won't they won't wait around long enough
23:32 - for the API call to come back and your
23:35 - content to be rendered they'll just
23:36 - think it's a blank page
23:44 - if you do want to know about doing
23:46 - server-side rendering to accommodate
23:48 - search engines you could check out the
23:49 - first project that we did where we used
23:52 - next Jas to handle or server-side
23:55 - rendering really alright we could I
24:05 - don't want to see what the spacing is
24:07 - like here and let's see do we have
24:12 - actually we do have sub headers let me
24:16 - um let me do a separate row then
24:29 - all right so I'm I was thinking about
24:33 - making this all you know just in one row
24:36 - and one column but I think I'd actually
24:42 - I'd like to keep it separate it may make
24:46 - it easier later on to put things into
24:48 - cards if we do end up putting them into
24:50 - cars I may break the cards up by section
24:55 - so that we don't have one big card and
24:58 - if that's the case then I'll probably
25:00 - probably want each card to be in its own
25:02 - column class and on large screens we may
25:05 - even separate it out depending on how
25:08 - much content is in there and instead of
25:11 - having every card be full page width we
25:13 - may do two columns so that that's why I
25:16 - was hesitating so much right there I was
25:19 - just trying to think of what what I may
25:21 - do later on so well actually you're not
25:28 - gonna call that planning guide view
25:31 - right now I have some instructions at
25:34 - the top of that page so I'm gonna make
25:37 - that the h2 and then our first section
25:48 - is titled plan ahead so let's do that
25:55 - and we want this to be an h3 with that
26:02 - to be an h3 and now we're just gonna
26:06 - have some paragraphs
26:29 - I'm just copying pasting some content
26:32 - that I have up on my other screen from
26:34 - what I had just showed you a little
26:37 - earlier
26:44 - just one more paragraph after this one
26:49 - and that will give us a good idea of
26:52 - what this is gonna look like about how
26:56 - much space is gonna take uh whoops
27:06 - there we go all right let's check this
27:09 - out okay
27:27 - so right off the bat I know these these
27:31 - header tags are all messed up in terms
27:35 - of font size so what we need to do to
27:39 - make this the same as the other pages is
27:44 - apply our float X class and in the same
27:48 - way that we've done on the other pages
27:51 - I'm I'm considering using flow text here
27:57 - as well
27:59 - if we really want people to read this
28:01 - then it should be a reasonable font size
28:04 - and right now at least on my screen this
28:08 - is not reasonable so I'm sure for you
28:11 - all it's even worse the terms of font
28:15 - size but I just think it would be
28:18 - difficult for me to read this so I don't
28:24 - want to make my users read that as well
28:26 - and let's see okay it was 16 is that no
28:34 - sorry I was looking at the wrong thing
28:35 - where's the font size
28:42 - that's odd I thought I had a maybe I
28:50 - didn't I thought at some point I had
28:52 - made the default font size 16 pixels but
28:56 - maybe I didn't know maybe I just did it
28:58 - from one page I'm not really sure all
29:00 - right so let's try to add flow text in
29:02 - here in a few places and if we make
29:17 - we're not flow text here and I'm going
29:21 - to add flow text flow text here let's
29:27 - see if that gets applied to everything
29:30 - alright awesome it did alright so you
29:34 - can see that that definitely looks like
29:38 - it'll be easier to read I'm not sure
29:47 - about that line height though let me
29:49 - know what you all think I'm sure line it
29:57 - all right we're not it's not even
29:59 - showing us lion height
30:02 - I do want to see
30:13 - some helpers are typography T I'd like
30:18 - to see what the line height is for
30:21 - material lives for flow text yeah that
30:24 - looks like it's definitely a bigger line
30:26 - height than what we have right now so
30:29 - let's check that out line height line
30:35 - height 1.5 and that's directly on the
30:39 - HTML all right let's see about changing
30:45 - the line height because otherwise it's
30:49 - it's not gonna be nearly as readable and
30:57 - let me just pop
31:04 - let's see alright great let me meet him
31:08 - make this a bit smaller so we can toggle
31:11 - that line hi you just to see the
31:12 - difference yes that's that's a huge
31:21 - difference
31:23 - all right that's what we were missing I
31:25 - was I was messing with this a little bit
31:27 - earlier trying to look at the line
31:29 - heights and this was what I was was
31:34 - going for what I was missing earlier
31:36 - that makes a huge difference in
31:39 - readability so we're gonna throw that
31:43 - line height in there and I think I'm
31:49 - gonna put this line height on flow text
31:51 - it looked like in materialized at least
31:55 - on their website they have this they
32:00 - have some extra styles going on on their
32:02 - website that aren't in the materialized
32:06 - CSS so that line height was in those
32:11 - styles so I'm not sure I'm not sure if
32:16 - it's worthwhile to try to look through
32:17 - materialized and find where they're
32:19 - adding this line height because I right
32:23 - now I know I want to use this on float X
32:25 - but I'm not sure I want to use this
32:27 - anywhere else so for now I'm just gonna
32:29 - put it on anything that has that flow
32:32 - text class to it so let's find our sass
32:37 - file where we're using flow text which
32:41 - should be responsive text and
32:53 - yeah
32:55 - well if you if you want to see what SATs
32:58 - can do this is a really cool example of
33:01 - sass doing crazy stuff that you can't do
33:06 - normally in in CSS so check that out
33:10 - that's that's on the repo and I didn't
33:13 - do this this is from from materialize
33:19 - but really cool stuff alright so now
33:24 - that we have that in there should be
33:26 - able to refresh and it should look the
33:28 - same yep it does great actually I don't
33:37 - I don't mind how this looks without
33:44 - being inside of a card I think that's
33:48 - way too much space between here so we'll
33:51 - do something about that yeah but I don't
33:57 - I don't mind it definitely looks plain
34:02 - but we're not really we're not really
34:05 - going for flashy we just want to get
34:08 - information across the people one thing
34:12 - that might be nice if we do end up going
34:14 - making this section a lot longer is to
34:19 - have some sort of scroll spy so let me
34:23 - let me show you like materialise has I
34:26 - don't know if I want to do it exactly
34:28 - like this but you can see on the side
34:30 - like as you scroll it lets you know
34:34 - where you're at and then you can click
34:36 - that to go right to the section you want
34:40 - that might not be a bad idea to have if
34:43 - this starts to get really long
34:53 - but we'll see let me go I'm gonna go to
34:57 - the live sex I haven't checked in in a
34:59 - while I did set my Pomodoro timer but I
35:02 - said it a bit late so I may have
35:05 - actually been yeah it's already been 35
35:09 - minutes since we started so let me go I
35:12 - I know I asked you I asked you all some
35:15 - things several times and I never checked
35:17 - for an answer so I'm gonna check now
35:21 - okay cool so Kevin said definitely like
35:25 - more scrolling instead of more clicking
35:26 - so alright so I had asked I had
35:30 - mentioned that I think more scrolling is
35:32 - better than more clicking so glad glad
35:38 - that weren't agreement on that Kevin
35:51 - okay John Hanson had an idea he said and
35:54 - posted resources just put a single to
35:56 - pixel or three pixel green line under
35:58 - each heading length of the lines should
36:01 - be with n cards left or right padding or
36:04 - margins I said the icons icons look ok
36:11 - so so not like in the icon yeah
36:15 - actually thank you for that feedback do
36:20 - you all do you like the icons at all or
36:24 - did you say like forget the icons let me
36:32 - go back to that page just briefly here
36:37 - the poster resources so instead of icons
36:43 - just put a single green line under each
36:45 - heading
36:51 - okay so we're just gonna have a line
36:56 - under Hugh then okay I'm just trying to
36:59 - visualize this right now
37:07 - okay
37:12 - I think about ouch what I think about it
37:16 - maybe we try it out yet just there we go
37:28 - okay okay Sebastian said for future
37:37 - projects that you use create react app
37:39 - check out react snapshot to make it more
37:42 - SEO friendly or use something like
37:44 - Gatsby cool good to know I've been doing
37:48 - a lot with create react app lately next
37:51 - J s was what I'd used previously for all
37:55 - my projects but this project obviously
37:59 - is being using create react app and my
38:03 - projects for the Udacity react
38:06 - nanodegree courses are all done with
38:08 - create react app so lately I've been
38:13 - working with that again used to it so
38:14 - that's that's good to know that you know
38:18 - it could be done it could be SEO
38:21 - friendly even with create react tab okay
38:27 - so Kevin said I didn't know the H tags
38:30 - are meaningful for SEO could you explain
38:32 - a little about that okay so let me give
38:34 - the disclaimer that for SEO it's been
38:40 - it's been about two years since I've
38:44 - really considered myself knowledgable
38:49 - about SEO so when I started being a
38:53 - front-end developer full-time I quit
38:56 - taking on clients for SEO related work
39:00 - so I just wasn't interested in that
39:02 - anymore it wasn't gonna help me with my
39:05 - front-end skills and I didn't need the
39:09 - money to take on clients like that so
39:11 - having said that this knowledge may be
39:15 - outdated but I think it's still it's
39:19 - still true so your most important like
39:25 - HTML elements for SEO number one is
39:29 - going to be your title tag that's just
39:32 - that's been my experience that if I want
39:35 - to boost an SEO or change things the
39:39 - single biggest thing I can do on the
39:41 - page in the markup to change my ranking
39:45 - for certain keywords is to change the
39:47 - title tag at least that's that's how it
39:51 - was you know two years ago between like
39:55 - you know from five years ago to two
39:57 - years ago I had a lot of success in
39:59 - local SEO with just changing the title
40:02 - tags now beyond that your h1 tag would
40:06 - be the next most important things and
40:09 - then your lower tag so in general what I
40:13 - always recommended in what I what I used
40:15 - was so every page definitely you want to
40:20 - unique title tag and you want that title
40:22 - tag to have some significance for the
40:24 - keywords that you want to rank for but
40:27 - not just the keyword it needs to
40:28 - actually describe what's on the page as
40:30 - well I don't want to be misleading with
40:32 - that and then you wanna have one h1 on
40:35 - the page and that should also be
40:38 - descriptive it shouldn't be the same
40:40 - thing as your title tag but it should be
40:44 - accurate in terms of what the content on
40:46 - the page is and then you can have
40:48 - multiple other tags H tags beneath that
40:52 - but it should make sense you should use
40:53 - H tags for their intended purpose as
40:55 - headers you shouldn't use them for just
40:58 - to style things right if you just want
41:01 - some font to be bigger that's that's not
41:03 - the point and this is basic stuff right
41:05 - so this is not like secret SEO knowledge
41:09 - or anything this is just good practice
41:11 - for for markup for HTML but I think it
41:17 - also works with SEO and that it presents
41:20 - the search engine with a clear structure
41:22 - of your page and what it's about as long
41:26 - as you do it accurately so the like I
41:28 - said the H tag should accurately
41:30 - represent the content that there the
41:33 - header for and I think it you are more
41:38 - likely than
41:39 - to be indexed accurately based on your
41:41 - content so anyway that's why that's my
41:46 - SEO moment today so like I said haven't
41:50 - I have not researched SEO very much at
41:53 - all in the last two years so it's
41:55 - possible that it could have changed but
41:59 - those are just some some general rules
42:01 - definitely do your title tags give some
42:05 - thought to what key key words you'd like
42:07 - to rank for have one h1 and then use
42:11 - your H tags appropriately as headings
42:14 - not for style purposes does that make
42:20 - sense
42:21 - and if anyone else is more into SEO
42:25 - right now and you have anything to add
42:26 - to that or if I was wrong about
42:29 - something please let me know
42:38 - okay so Damien says I'm a day or two
42:43 - behind so not sure if you've covered
42:45 - this yet but I was trying to fix the
42:47 - scrolling such that the resource / side
42:50 - nav would scroll down as you go down the
42:53 - page I tried to use fixed CSS but
42:57 - resources the resource would hover over
43:00 - cars actually I've never tried this I
43:05 - just so
43:07 - [Music]
43:34 - so Damien said I wanted to get the
43:36 - effect that the resource menu would be
43:39 - available as user Scrolls down so I'm
43:44 - just to be clear about what we're
43:46 - talking about do you mean you want this
43:48 - to be able to scroll down with as we
43:51 - scroll at first I thought you meant this
43:54 - but I I don't know if you can but I
43:57 - can't even scroll at all while this is
43:59 - open so I guess it makes more sense that
44:06 - you'd want this so let me know if that's
44:09 - what you were talking about Damien and
44:14 - yeah that might not be a bad idea to
44:17 - implement something like that so we'll
44:19 - have to check out material UI I would
44:22 - imagine that they probably have
44:23 - something built in for this but I
44:25 - haven't I haven't tried to do it so but
44:29 - I could see at first I didn't think
44:31 - about it because all our pages
44:32 - originally didn't really require very
44:35 - much scrolling but if we're gonna have
44:36 - pages like this which will have a decent
44:39 - amount of scrolling then it does it
44:40 - would make sense to allow the user to be
44:43 - able to you know get to this side nav
44:46 - even if they've scrolled you know down
44:50 - the page alright
45:08 - okay so I'm gonna go back to the code
45:20 - and let's check out so Sebastian just
45:23 - let me know about the stepper and
45:26 - material UI so let's check that out
45:29 - because if we can put that in the page
45:31 - now that might be kind of the most
45:34 - exciting thing that we can do on this
45:36 - page so it'd be cool to get that done
45:38 - you know while we're doing this so I'm
45:41 - actually let me move this on the screen
45:42 - so you all can see since I just spent
45:45 - about I don't know eight minutes maybe
45:48 - maybe even 10 minutes going through some
45:51 - of the questions in the live chat I'm
45:52 - not gonna do the break right now I'm
45:54 - just gonna restart this you know now and
45:57 - then we're gonna do one more 25-minute
45:59 - session and when this is done that'll
46:02 - put us a little bit over that hour that
46:04 - I wanted to spend coding and since I
46:07 - spent a lot of time earlier going over
46:11 - some of the pull requests and the
46:12 - changes then it'll be okay if we go over
46:16 - that hour and then after that I'll go
46:18 - back to the live chat and answer
46:21 - questions so it's fine
46:24 - stepper whoops stepper
46:32 - okay all right yeah this
46:48 - so definitely the vertical stepper makes
46:53 - a lot of sense and yeah instead of you
46:59 - know clicking obviously we would want
47:00 - this to happen on scroll which it looks
47:03 - like yeah okay so it looks like you can
47:09 - control that
47:28 - okay so we can control based on the step
47:32 - index where you're at which one gets
47:39 - highlighted so if we would just track
47:46 - the scrolling yeah if we track the
47:51 - scrolling on the page and then change
47:55 - our state based on the scroll position
47:59 - then that should work and you know we'll
48:07 - we definitely want to change you know
48:09 - how this the default styling of this
48:12 - which is just fine
48:18 - cool thanks Sebastian I yeah I think
48:21 - this will definitely work and yeah this
48:27 - is pretty it's not exactly what we
48:31 - wanted but it has enough of what we want
48:34 - that I think it's worth trying to adapt
48:36 - this all right well let's get a few more
48:43 - sections on the page so that we actually
48:45 - can have enough enough space to scroll
48:49 - to really try this out and then let's
48:52 - try to add it in and probably what I'll
48:55 - do is we'll try to add it in you know
48:57 - kind of as is just to see if we can get
49:00 - it to work and then we'll worry about
49:01 - styling it the way we want it okay so
49:07 - let me add in I got logged out of so
49:14 - this my friends this can get Lugg love
49:17 - me out so there's you don't really have
49:19 - a lot of time in there before you get
49:21 - logged up but I have
49:27 - I do have all the code available and
49:31 - maybe I should just copy and paste that
49:36 - because that's on github so I don't have
49:39 - to worry about getting logged out so
49:42 - let's do that and that'll be nicer I
49:44 - won't need to manually make all the
49:48 - paragraph tags I'll just copy them over
49:51 - so yeah let's go with so the current
50:03 - order is after the plan ahead then we
50:05 - have a list of all the different types
50:08 - of things that we can do all our
50:12 - services but I think we want it I'm
50:16 - gonna try to change that order I don't
50:18 - see anything yeah I don't see anything
50:25 - in the text that that's in there that
50:29 - would a user would expect to see a list
50:32 - right after that of services so I think
50:34 - we can safely change the order of this
50:38 - so right now I have this
50:51 - I will need to change the age tags
51:03 - but it should work I should be able to
51:06 - just paste this in and have it work so
51:13 - we definitely don't want these to be age
51:15 - ones
51:22 - area
51:28 - I'm going to make these h threes and
51:41 - we can change this too
51:50 - this will be a link
51:55 - to
52:03 - and then we'll need to import slowed up
52:07 - in there
52:07 - I believe I grabbed an extra div that we
52:11 - do not need there we go we need to
52:14 - import link if yeah so we're not using
52:16 - that already so have it here I thought I
52:23 - had it
52:27 - how am i linking to these oh you know
52:29 - what now I remember we switched it to
52:32 - generic card so we wouldn't have to
52:33 - bring in links oh here it is
52:46 - okay now we'll see how that looks
52:53 - great make sure that works yep that
52:56 - works okay
53:06 - it gives us a bit more bit more space
53:16 - all right now we also have a larger
53:21 - section that are all the services
53:33 - I think that that may make sense as a
53:38 - separate section
53:59 - let me just I'm just gonna put it in
54:01 - down below so you all can see it we can
54:05 - figure out whether we want it to be in a
54:06 - separate section I mean it would be
54:08 - beneficial if users did see that because
54:14 - they may not really know it all the
54:16 - things that we do so it might be
54:18 - important that they see at first and
54:21 - they don't have to click to get to it
54:37 - and this would be cool because this this
54:39 - will have some markup that is somewhat
54:42 - less common I know I had never used this
54:46 - markup before until I did this project
54:49 - so we have all these these deals and DTS
54:55 - right so this is actually I wonder what
55:02 - the default styles will be okay not bad
55:04 - not bad
55:06 - so if we could if you see each so each
55:11 - DL right has DT which is like the title
55:17 - and then your d DS which is your content
55:21 - right so this is if you're gonna have
55:24 - like a dictionary style listing this is
55:28 - the proper markup to do that so you'll
55:34 - have you know your word and then your
55:37 - definition
55:46 - all right so that's yet not really sure
55:50 - what I want to do with that yet see what
55:53 - a tag were using okay so you're actually
55:55 - using a shoe it's good it doesn't really
56:00 - look that good to have the header be an
56:03 - entire sentence
56:12 - I may switch this
56:25 - yeah let's switch this
56:42 - I think this
56:45 - we'll look a bit better there we go okay
56:49 - so if services and that's a bit of an
56:51 - introduction and then we have this okay
56:56 - all right not bad now let's try to put
57:01 - that that scroll well we'll work on
57:07 - making it via Scrolls by style list so
57:13 - let's see if we can fit it let me think
57:20 - how we gonna fit this in
57:29 - I guess this will end up being a fixed
57:31 - position so it's really gonna exist
57:34 - outside the normal flow of our layout so
57:40 - it won't it won't really matter where we
57:41 - put this I'll probably put the mark up
57:44 - for it above all of this and then we'll
57:47 - give it a fixed position and it will
57:52 - stay with the user the entire time yeah
57:57 - that makes that makes the most sense for
58:00 - this so let's grab let's grab some of
58:07 - this markup lose the line this one
58:19 - I would see if we're getting anything
58:22 - from interior UI we're not
58:32 - we'll grab everything from now and
58:35 - probably won't need to keep it all
58:37 - though
58:58 - I guess this may actually be better as a
59:02 - separate component at some point right
59:05 - now let's just we'll just take all this
59:11 - and put it in our component just to see
59:16 - if it works
59:22 - actually it was this the one I'm gonna
59:25 - see if I'm getting the right one okay
59:27 - now I want a needle on with the granular
59:29 - control right yeah
59:43 - there we go
60:02 - this will bring in the styles too since
60:07 - it's it's not gonna like it if I don't
60:10 - bring in the style
60:18 - okay
60:21 - now
60:27 - style should I feel it'll do
60:33 - yeah we're definitely gonna need to
60:36 - change those to fit with our page but
60:38 - for now we'll just grab everything
60:48 - and put it all inside
60:55 - inside this div doesn't make sense to
61:00 - put it above the title but I'm gonna
61:04 - give us some space okay let's let's see
61:12 - if we've done this correctly
61:14 - oh that was I'm excited that was a lot
61:20 - of copy and pasting and I to get it all
61:24 - in the right spot click a step to get
61:27 - started next next great
61:39 - okay so everything's working we have
61:42 - more than we need and we need to style
61:45 - it differently and for some reason I
61:47 - grab the horizontal I guess instead of
61:50 - the vertical I'm not sure how I didn't
61:52 - notice that but we did need the granular
61:57 - control where's our vertical looks like
62:01 - we can just switch to orientation
62:03 - vertical and let's see if that'll work
62:09 - for us we're so stepper
62:19 - great all right so we have a vertical
62:22 - orientation now which is awesome let's
62:27 - move this over this is gonna look really
62:30 - bad at first while we test it but the
62:36 - only styling that I want to do at this
62:38 - point is just to make it fixed so that
62:40 - as I scroll I can still see what's going
62:42 - on
62:54 - there we go position:fixed great I don't
62:59 - want it on that side I relive it on this
63:02 - side so
63:10 - right
63:14 - whoa
63:32 - all right so that's why it's giving us
63:35 - there we go
63:37 - gonna get rid of that that width and we
63:40 - want to add that great and that actually
63:44 - yeah that's that's not a bad spot later
63:49 - on it might not be a bad idea to have it
63:51 - down just you know a little bit more but
63:53 - I thought it was gonna overlap this text
63:56 - but it doesn't it's too close so it
63:59 - doesn't look great but for right now
64:03 - that's good that'll just let us see
64:05 - what's going on so let's grab this style
64:11 - here and you should be able to change it
64:15 - yep go change it here we can just
64:18 - replace this with
64:25 - that and we need to also add that
64:27 - position I forgot to copy that over some
64:38 - fixed oops and we need commas because
64:46 - this is an object great whoops
64:53 - what did I do nope I did not put that in
65:02 - quotation marks
65:11 - okay great
65:14 - all right now we need some sort of
65:20 - scroll
65:25 - let's save material UI
65:32 - all right so let me let me ask this see
65:38 - if any of you know before I before I
65:40 - start searching not that I'm against
65:42 - searching but it's just boring if I'm
65:45 - searching while I'm live-streaming
65:47 - so is there something built in the
65:51 - material UI that I can use that will
65:53 - track scrolling if not is there
65:57 - something for react the track scrolling
66:00 - that I could use and if there's not
66:04 - something specific for react I just need
66:06 - some sort of plug-in that is vanilla
66:09 - JavaScript don't want jQuery that tracks
66:13 - scrolling if none of those if we if we
66:16 - don't have any of those things then
66:18 - we'll just have to do it from scratch
66:22 - which is cool but we're not gonna have
66:25 - time to finish that today so I'll check
66:30 - I'm gonna give it a minute or so and
66:32 - then I'll check the live stream or I'm
66:38 - sorry the live chat see if you all know
66:41 - anything about that
66:59 - also I I wouldn't worry too much about
67:03 - the scroll tracking working with
67:07 - touchscreens so there's going to be some
67:12 - use cases where people may have a large
67:14 - screen that is also a touch screen but
67:16 - those will be small but the use case in
67:19 - which we'll have a mobile screen where
67:22 - when you touch I'm not as worried about
67:24 - because this will just be hidden on
67:27 - those screens we will not have enough
67:28 - space to put this in so for now I'm just
67:33 - worried about normal scrolling that's
67:39 - not touch based
67:55 - okay so it looks like Sebastian says it
67:59 - doesn't look like there's any anything
68:03 - built-in materiai
68:04 - all right so my search is on the other
68:07 - screen some of the top searches have
68:11 - used jQuery but it looks like I found
68:15 - one that's vanilla JavaScript
68:25 - it's a it's a pretty old answer though
68:28 - it's from seven years ago so it might
68:33 - work but maybe I don't want to find one
68:35 - that's that's different
68:41 - okay so then says what do you mean by
68:45 - track scrolling basically I just want to
68:49 - know the users scroll position on the
68:53 - page so that once let's say when they're
68:57 - at the top section this part will be
68:59 - highlighted but then once they get here
69:02 - then that second section will be
69:04 - highlighted then the third section right
69:08 - then will have a fourth so I want to
69:11 - know when the user gets to a certain
69:14 - point in the page at that point I want
69:18 - to change the state which will then
69:22 - change which one of these is highlighted
69:24 - so these will all correspond to a
69:28 - section on the page okay does that make
69:31 - sense
70:07 - actually there's a I don't need this but
70:11 - there's a react Kurt react cursor
70:13 - position NPM package that sounds really
70:17 - cool it'll give you coordinates for
70:20 - where the cursor is so fYI that's that
70:24 - sounds really cool
70:37 - I'm finding finding stuff about how to
70:39 - do this with react native
71:04 - okay look I have found some code that it
71:11 - looks like people use this for react and
71:13 - it has worked so then in the live chat
71:24 - says a manual window dot on scroll will
71:27 - be the handiest okay that's that looks
71:33 - like
71:39 - it looks like some of the stuff that I'm
71:40 - seeing on my other screen with the the
71:43 - searches so that's probably what we'll
71:45 - go with so we're not gonna do it in this
71:49 - stream but I think this will be kind of
71:54 - cool to do on a live stream so I'm gonna
71:56 - save it I'm not gonna work on it and
72:00 - we'll work on it tomorrow
72:04 - what's tomorrow Thursday okay yeah I'm
72:06 - pretty sure that I don't have anything
72:08 - going on tomorrow afternoon so it should
72:10 - be same time we'll have time to do this
72:11 - I'm not gonna work on it if one of you
72:14 - really really wants to work on it and
72:17 - submit a pull request for it that's cool
72:20 - too I'm open to that in which case we
72:23 - would just take the beginning of
72:25 - tomorrow stream and go over how that was
72:30 - done either way I definitely want to
72:33 - show on the live stream how we do this
72:36 - because I imagine this is I'm well for
72:40 - sure I'm not the only person trying to
72:42 - do something like this in react and it
72:44 - wouldn't be useful just for this it
72:46 - would be useful for any type of
72:48 - animations that you want to happen as
72:51 - the user Scrolls and I'm sure there's
72:53 - you know 100 other things that would be
72:55 - useful for as well so I'll work on other
72:58 - things there's definitely a lot of a lot
73:03 - left to do a lot of small style things
73:07 - and so I'll work on that
73:11 - now the coding portion of this is going
73:15 - to be done so if you were just sticking
73:16 - around for the code you're not
73:18 - interested in the question and answer
73:20 - session thanks for watching and you
73:23 - could go do whatever you need to do now
73:26 - otherwise if you have any questions
73:28 - please put them in the live chat right
73:29 - now I'm going to try to get through all
73:31 - your questions and answer them as best
73:34 - as I can and not just me everyone in the
73:37 - live chat is very knowledgeable and
73:39 - helpful and provide some great answers
73:41 - too so if you think I'm a noob and you
73:45 - don't really want my opinion then it's
73:47 - still worth it to put a question alive
73:49 - because there are other people in this
73:50 - lab chat that are far from being noobs
73:52 - and are very knowledgeable if you don't
73:57 - want to put something in the live chat
73:58 - for whatever reason you can direct
74:00 - message me on Twitter or message me on
74:01 - any other social media platform that you
74:05 - like to use or you could put it in the
74:08 - comments to this video and I'll get to
74:10 - it when I can probably the most reliable
74:13 - way to get in touch with me is a direct
74:15 - message on Twitter if for whatever
74:19 - reason I just tend to get to those
74:23 - messages faster than I do to like let's
74:26 - say comments comments on the video are
74:29 - actually a little bit hard to keep track
74:31 - of for me because there's a lot of
74:33 - videos now so I trying to go through and
74:36 - find which videos have the comments a
74:38 - little bit difficult alright so let me
74:43 - scroll back up and
74:53 - on Shaddai answer any questions it
74:56 - doesn't look like there's a lot so this
74:58 - may not may not be a very long
75:00 - question-and-answer session
75:13 - okay awesome so it looks like in with
75:19 - the text the font size it looks like you
75:24 - all think that the larger font size with
75:27 - the increased line height is definitely
75:30 - better easier to read so I'm glad glad
75:35 - you all agree with me on that I've
75:39 - actually had some pushback from people
75:41 - who I'm building websites for here at
75:44 - the university that they're they don't
75:46 - really like the larger font size mainly
75:49 - because then they can't fit as much text
75:51 - on a page it looks huge my response is
75:55 - usually well maybe there just shouldn't
75:58 - be as much text who's gonna read all
76:01 - that text that then also hey it's a heck
76:04 - of a lot easier to read it when it's
76:06 - when it's a larger font size
76:22 - okay so Kevin had an idea about the
76:26 - poster resources so we had talked about
76:33 - posters so but first I talked about
76:37 - putting a big icon at the top here like
76:39 - I have on the live version but it seems
76:43 - like that's we're not gonna go with that
76:47 - at least I had some feedback from some
76:50 - of you saying that that would not look
76:52 - good which is fun I'm definitely open to
76:55 - a change we had John said well what
77:00 - about putting a line under here and now
77:03 - Kevin says what about the Green Line and
77:07 - then also an icon on the left left like
77:10 - a chrome notification card so we would
77:13 - have a much smaller icon over here which
77:15 - of course would push this over and then
77:18 - the line so yeah we could try that as
77:22 - well yeah it wouldn't be a big deal to
77:26 - try both ways and see how they look so
77:31 - maybe we'll do that if I have time maybe
77:36 - I'll try to do that before tomorrow
77:38 - streams so that we can compare and see
77:40 - which one looks better
77:47 - okay and earlier Damien had an idea in a
77:54 - question about how to make it work to
77:56 - make this stay fixed at the top so I
77:59 - asked him for clarification and in fact
78:02 - it was so basically once that would
78:07 - sometimes it's called a sticky nav or
78:10 - fixed navigation and where we would
78:12 - scroll down to can't do in this page
78:14 - we'd scroll down and it would still stay
78:17 - there so yeah so we've done that on
78:21 - previous projects well we kind of had a
78:25 - version of a sticky and at one previous
78:27 - project right we had one that kind of
78:30 - went sticky as we scroll but yeah I
78:33 - definitely think that's a good idea so
78:37 - we'll try to implement that as well so
78:39 - thank you for that Damien
78:48 - so Chaz Chad says hello I'm a new hey
78:52 - Chad don't worry about it I definitely
78:56 - consider myself somewhat of a noob too
78:58 - in many areas so you're in the right
79:01 - place
79:18 - hmm okay Damien says I've been having
79:22 - some issues when trying to push to
79:24 - github with everything up-to-date is
79:26 - there a way to resolve this I did try
79:29 - googling and just end up pulling your
79:31 - work he said any tips on resolving this
79:36 - error
79:50 - let's see yeah Damian so not sure so
79:55 - then had some advice for that to make
79:57 - sure that you add the changes and commit
79:59 - the changes first and then do your get
80:02 - push so I'm not sure
80:08 - yes adamian not sure if that advice
80:15 - would work or if you're already doing
80:16 - that or not so yeah let me know if you
80:22 - want to message me on Twitter or
80:23 - something so we can talk about it and
80:26 - get some more information and I'd be
80:29 - happy to help you
80:40 - okay XANA actually is is not a fan of
80:44 - the sticking of it says it takes up
80:47 - space maybe go with an arrow to the top
80:50 - instead
81:03 - alright let's let me think about that it
81:09 - does take up space it's not a very tall
81:15 - header though wouldn't take up that much
81:17 - space maybe we'll have to think more
81:20 - about it I
81:22 - I mean I'm also fine with having that
81:26 - that little arrow to the top would
81:29 - definitely have well especially if we're
81:33 - going to do a scroll tracker then we
81:35 - could have it so that once you get to a
81:37 - certain point of scrolling then the
81:39 - arrow appears what what if we did this
81:45 - alright how about this idea
81:47 - what if we had it so that as you scroll
81:50 - it looks like this but as soon as you
81:54 - scroll up a little bit it appears no
81:56 - matter where you're at so a lot of I
81:59 - think apps do this
82:01 - so as you're scrolling down the top bar
82:05 - just disappears but if you just scroll
82:07 - up a little bit it'll it'll come back
82:10 - again so I that may be the best of both
82:13 - worlds so that it's not blocked if you
82:17 - don't want it to block your view right
82:18 - it won't block your view but then if you
82:20 - want to see it all you have to do is
82:21 - just scroll up a bit hopefully that
82:25 - makes sense did I do this I do think I
82:30 - did this for something I guess I guess I
82:32 - could show you an example in case it's
82:34 - not clear to anyone just gotta remember
82:38 - what project that did this on
82:48 - I let me see if it's this project
82:53 - no not that one
83:08 - okay all right so I've done it here so
83:13 - I'm gonna bring this over so this is a
83:17 - project that I did sometime last year
83:20 - and you can see I mean this is a
83:24 - transparent nav so it's not really that
83:29 - permanent anyway but it goes away and
83:31 - now as we scroll down you see goes away
83:36 - when we scroll up it just appears right
83:38 - so something like that might be cool to
83:42 - have
83:48 - all right so hopefully that was a decent
83:53 - illustration of what I was what I was
83:55 - talking about
84:06 - okay cool so about the salami let me
84:16 - bring this over since I just had this
84:18 - question if I can find this
84:29 - sorry I know I'm I'm not making sense
84:35 - right now but let me show you what I'm
84:37 - talking
84:40 - all right so Matt was able to catch the
84:44 - live stream right now so he's in the lot
84:46 - the live stream in the live chat so
84:48 - about this pull request so if you want
84:51 - to check it out pull request 41 if you
84:56 - want to check it out this is what we're
84:57 - talking about so you can see this is the
85:00 - explanation which is excellent you know
85:04 - very detailed so anyway Matt's in the
85:09 - chat right now and he's saying about the
85:11 - pull request is setting state like you
85:14 - know just using state equals and then an
85:17 - object the newer way and let me see if I
85:19 - can this should be me up here so setting
85:23 - state like this as opposed to using the
85:27 - constructor like this he's asking is
85:31 - that the newer way so essentially like
85:35 - part part of this pull request was
85:38 - changing from this to this assuming that
85:44 - this is the preferred way and it's a
85:46 - better way and that this was not the
85:48 - best way to do it but it may be the case
85:52 - that this is just a newer way to do it
85:54 - and is acceptable
85:55 - so that's that's the question
86:13 - all right so
86:26 - all right so Ben says you can do it like
86:30 - that in the constructor for the initial
86:32 - state and then set state for all changes
86:35 - yeah so I think what we were
86:49 - okay so Ben I think Ben is actually
86:51 - saying do it in the constructor as well
87:22 - you stay
87:28 - yeah so basically yeah let me explain so
87:32 - I could probably bring up and show you
87:35 - the difference in context here so for
87:38 - instance in generic card component we
87:41 - are using the constructor right and
87:44 - we're doing this state and we're adding
87:45 - things in here
87:46 - but in I know we're doing it differently
87:52 - in one of these components so let me see
88:04 - we were we were doing it differently
88:15 - there we go so for instance here in
88:19 - logos Jas I'm setting state initially
88:25 - just like this right as opposed to doing
88:30 - it like this with within the constructor
88:50 - okay and Matt said that he he actually
88:54 - talked to someone who is a developer for
88:56 - a for a large startup company and said
89:01 - that he's been doing it this way like
89:05 - we're doing here for a long time so not
89:12 - sure that there's any difference okay so
89:21 - been saying I think both work this is uh
89:27 - this is a good question like
89:40 - who
89:55 - so I think
90:08 - maybe I need to do a bit more research
90:10 - on this so right now in in this project
90:16 - most of the time we're doing things like
90:19 - this in fact this this may be the only
90:23 - time when we're doing it like this I'm
90:27 - not exactly sure about that but it seems
90:29 - like this is the way we've been doing it
90:34 - and it works but this also works right
90:37 - I've been on this page it works as far
90:40 - as I know there's no errors so let's see
90:47 - those
91:01 - okay yeah so no errors even as we change
91:06 - the state there's still no errors so in
91:12 - terms of what works right we know that
91:14 - it works but I guess my
91:37 - so basically but my thing is that at
91:42 - this point is assuming that they both
91:45 - work and that these are both in use and
91:52 - you know in react projects that are out
91:55 - there so you know so evidently there's a
91:59 - developer at a large startup that's
92:00 - doing it like this so assuming that
92:04 - these are both in use and they both work
92:07 - which we know they work is there any
92:12 - difference and then would that
92:14 - difference simply be a performance
92:16 - difference or is there something bigger
92:18 - that um that we're missing on this
92:22 - actually you definitely would like to
92:24 - know about this so if you're watching
92:25 - the recording it would be nice maybe if
92:28 - in the comments let me know which way
92:33 - you you handles this I do you use one or
92:38 - the other or a combination sometimes you
92:41 - use one or the other or what's your
92:42 - reasoning behind it so definitely I mean
92:48 - this is definitely beyond my current
92:50 - knowledge of react I think I'm pretty
92:57 - sure that in the react course that I'm
92:59 - taking right now this was the way so the
93:02 - one way we're doing an engineer card
93:04 - Jass is is the way that they've shown
93:08 - how to do that but like I said just not
93:14 - sure what the difference is
93:54 - okay
94:05 - okay Pat Fewell says it's es7 new to a
94:09 - lot of people okay so it's see we have
94:17 - quite a discussion going on now in in
94:24 - the live chat about this issue so all
94:33 - right so at this point I think I'm I'm
94:36 - to the bottom of the you know I'm to the
94:38 - end of the the live chat so I'm I'm
94:48 - gonna wrap this up but if you want to
94:55 - continue this discussion in a live chat
94:57 - sort of way check out the slack channel
95:01 - [Music]
95:06 - so let me show you all the slack channel
95:10 - so FCC live stream so FCC - live -
95:19 - stream slack calm so we have this slack
95:25 - channel so you can continue the
95:27 - discussion if you want to I'm definitely
95:30 - interested in this and I'm gonna try
95:34 - five time I'm gonna try to research it a
95:36 - bit more as well maybe look at some
95:38 - other projects and see how they're doing
95:40 - it so
95:52 - okay so thank you so much for watching
95:58 - and for all your help and the live chat
96:01 - I really appreciate all your your
96:04 - opinions on you know on everything that
96:07 - we're doing and today especially it was
96:10 - more about the look of things which is
96:12 - definitely it's super helpful just to
96:16 - get a second opinion a second and
96:19 - sometimes third and fourth and fifth set
96:21 - of eyes on this you know right away that
96:24 - immediate feedback really ends up making
96:26 - it look you know so much nicer so yes I
96:36 - think that's it for day sorry the
96:38 - discussion is still going on in the live
96:40 - chat so I was just reading the last few
96:42 - a few comments there but I will be back
96:47 - tomorrow okay matt said to let him know
96:55 - about the pool request yeah I've
97:00 - definitely yes oh I've downloaded that
97:05 - that pool request as a separate branch
97:08 - and I've been trying to test it out the
97:12 - thing I had today is that so I tried to
97:14 - merge the changes that were in master
97:16 - into that pool request into that branch
97:19 - and I didn't get through them all before
97:21 - I so I just a lot of things that have
97:27 - been updated so I couldn't get through
97:28 - it all and kind of properly test it but
97:32 - I I definitely want to so I'm gonna try
97:37 - to give that give that a shot when I can
97:42 - cuz hopefully sooner rather than later
97:44 - because the more changes I make it's
97:46 - just gonna make it harder to merge
97:48 - everything okay so I'll be back tomorrow
97:54 - sorry I keep trying to say goodbye and
97:58 - not doing a good job of it but I will be
