00:06 - hey everybody it's
00:08 - Jesse if you're new to the show uh I
00:12 - live stream my work it's just my normal
00:14 - work that I do every
00:15 - day the whole point is to
00:19 - show what a front-end developer does
00:22 - even the mistakes that I
00:24 - make hopefully I don't make too many
00:27 - mistakes but i' just like people to see
00:29 - that
00:31 - you don't have to be perfect to get a
00:33 - job as a developer especially people who
00:35 - are just starting
00:37 - out today we're going to do something
00:41 - that took me a while to figure out how
00:43 - to
00:43 - do it's really cool and
00:47 - useful and if you want to be able to do
00:51 - serice side rendering and make API
00:54 - calls then this this is one way to do it
00:57 - it's not the only way but this is the
00:59 - way that I found
01:00 - that's the easiest for me before we get
01:03 - started I'm gonna somebody asked in a
01:06 - live stream how long this is going to be
01:08 - about a half an hour if there's a lot of
01:10 - people in the chat asking questions
01:12 - sometimes I go over but I don't think
01:15 - I've ever gone longer than 45 minutes
01:18 - but the the code portion of it will be
01:20 - over in about a half an hour so 2:30 PM
01:24 - eastern
01:26 - time uh before we get started
01:30 - just want to give a shout out to my wife
01:32 - it's our 10th anniversary so sometimes
01:35 - she watches the show so in case she's
01:38 - watching happy
01:40 - anniversary uh I went over this
01:42 - yesterday the the schedule for next week
01:45 - so I'm not going to go over it in depth
01:47 - I just wanted to put it up here so you
01:48 - could see it I'm going to be at syntax
01:50 - Con in South Carolina next week the the
01:54 - end of next week so my schedule's going
01:56 - to be off and I have a lot of meetings
01:58 - early in the week so we're going to live
02:00 - stream Monday Tuesday at 11:30 a.m.
02:02 - eastern time I don't know if I'm going
02:04 - to be able to do it Wednesday I'll try
02:06 - and then I'm going to get in touch with
02:07 - the people who are organizing syntax con
02:10 - and see if they're cool with me doing
02:11 - some live streaming maybe some
02:13 - interviews from syntax conon so I'll let
02:16 - you know when I hear back from them and
02:19 - see if I can do
02:22 - that all right so
02:24 - let's oh thanks uh Julian said congrats
02:31 - what time is there now it's uh it's 2
02:35 - p.m where I'm
02:37 - at all right so let me let me flip over
02:41 - here and uh show
02:44 - you let me show you the page that we're
02:47 - going to
02:48 - be putting this
02:50 - on and I'm going to show
02:57 - you the data you can see the data on the
03:00 - screen right
03:04 - now okay so I'll pull this page over so
03:08 - this is a news page there's nothing on
03:10 - it right now it's going to be a Blog
03:11 - style
03:15 - page someone in the live chat asked NYC
03:18 - I'm actually I'm I'm in the same time
03:19 - zone as New York
03:22 - City but I'm in yeah I'm actually in
03:25 - Ohio I'm I'm on the very Eastern edge of
03:28 - Ohio so I'm Prett pretty close to
03:30 - Pittsburgh it's about a half hour drive
03:32 - for me to get to Pittsburgh so you you
03:35 - may be more familiar with where
03:37 - Pittsburgh is than where Stubenville is
03:39 - which is the city that I'm in right
03:45 - now somebody says hello from laia cool
03:49 - yeah so usually I I do have people give
03:51 - you know shout out where they're from uh
03:54 - I don't know the last week people just
03:56 - started doing that and I thought it was
03:57 - cool so if you want to put in the live
03:59 - stream where you're from and then at the
04:01 - end of the show I'll go through and uh
04:04 - just say where everybody was
04:09 - from so this is the news
04:12 - page like I said it's just going to be a
04:14 - Blog Page so what we want to do is we
04:16 - want to get data from a
04:20 - WordPress installation that's on a
04:22 - totally different
04:24 - server and we want to display that data
04:27 - here using the WordPress API I'm not
04:29 - going to go over how to set up anything
04:32 - in WordPress but the API is now uh it
04:35 - comes with WordPress course you don't
04:37 - need any extra plugins or anything it it
04:39 - should just work I don't
04:42 - think hey somebody's from Charleston
04:45 - South Carolina I'm gonna be in
04:46 - Charleston next week so uh Joey on the
04:49 - live chat uh I'll be in
04:53 - Charleston I'll be there Wednesday
04:55 - Thursday and Friday of next week for the
04:58 - uh St tax conon uh conference you should
05:01 - check it out if you can if you have
05:04 - time
05:07 - so like I said the word it's actually
05:09 - super easy I don't even think you have
05:11 - to switch on the API I think it's just
05:13 - on by default somebody can correct me if
05:16 - if I'm wrong but when I started working
05:19 - with it oh it's probably been a year
05:23 - maybe maybe a little more than a year
05:24 - probably a year and a half since I
05:25 - started working with the WordPress API
05:27 - you did have to install some plugins
05:30 - but uh now it's it's easier to work
05:33 - with so we want to grab that data but we
05:35 - don't just want to pull it
05:38 - in you know on the client side because
05:42 - if we pull in that
05:44 - data you know on the client side in the
05:49 - browser it'll be fine for for a regular
05:52 - person viewing it but if a search engine
05:55 - wants to check out your page they're
05:57 - going to see a blank page if if all your
05:59 - contents coming from an
06:01 - API search engines are well some of them
06:05 - I mean
06:07 - Google's uh Google search crawler can
06:09 - handle some JavaScript pretty well but
06:12 - it doesn't stick around long enough to
06:14 - get an API call back it doesn't matter
06:16 - how fast the call is I've tested it
06:18 - before with um W with just like you know
06:23 - test
06:25 - data that that should have loaded almost
06:27 - instantaneously and and you still
06:30 - it's not it doesn't work with search
06:32 - engines so the only way that I know of
06:36 - to make this site search engine
06:40 - friendly is to actually make the API
06:42 - call on the server okay so we're we're
06:45 - going to run node on the
06:47 - server right now it's just a local uh
06:52 - development environment so it's just on
06:53 - my local machine I'll do a live stream
06:56 - maybe maybe sometime next week if I can
06:58 - about actually setting up the
07:01 - server but on the server we're going to
07:04 - make the
07:05 - call and then we're going to render the
07:08 - HTML based on that data we get from the
07:11 - API on the server and what's going to
07:14 - get sent to the client on that first
07:16 - load is all the
07:25 - markup so to make this a little bit
07:27 - easier
07:29 - we are using
07:32 - nextjs so check out next I I have links
07:36 - to everything that I'm going to talk
07:38 - about in the description so if I
07:40 - mentioned something you're not familiar
07:42 - with check out the description for this
07:43 - video and and the links I do have this
07:47 - repo up now it's it's on GitHub the link
07:50 - is there uh the last couple shows I
07:53 - didn't have the repo up yet but now you
07:54 - can you can check everything out
07:59 - so we don't really need to see this
08:01 - until we finish the code now so I'm
08:02 - going to move this off just to show you
08:05 - what the data is going to look like let
08:08 - me zoom in a little bit here okay this
08:10 - is what WordPress sends back if I if I
08:14 - hit this
08:16 - URL it sends me back you know some Json
08:20 - all we're going to get today is I want
08:23 - this
08:24 - title and I want the content I don't
08:27 - really need anything else
08:29 - we'll see in in later videos I'll I'll
08:32 - start to get really detailed in in what
08:34 - I'm getting from here and actually get
08:37 - rid of all the stuff I don't need just
08:39 - to make it you know just a little bit
08:42 - faster uh but for now this is just what
08:45 - it looks like I have nothing special the
08:47 - only thing I added special in terms of
08:49 - parameters on the end I don't know if
08:51 - you can see that I did add uh posts per
08:54 - page 100 but I think I only have four
08:57 - demo posts set up so it doesn't even
08:59 - make sense um I'm going to move this off
09:02 - to the side we won't really need to see
09:05 - that we only need to bring that back if
09:07 - something goes
09:09 - wrong all right so now let's let's check
09:12 - out the
09:14 - code and we'll go to our page news news
09:19 - JS if you're not familiar with how next
09:22 - Works uh
09:24 - next basically is a way to let you get
09:27 - started with react very quickly
09:29 - it comes built in with a lot of cool
09:31 - stuff like serers side
09:34 - rendering and all your pages in your
09:37 - site all you have to do is make a file
09:41 - in this Pages folder and then the
09:43 - routing just works it handles all the
09:44 - routing for you so this is our news
09:48 - page all we have here we're uh we're
09:51 - importing some components just some
09:54 - basic things our footer uh our title we
09:57 - have this head tag is is custom for for
10:01 - next so we imported here it's next head
10:04 - so this is uh not exactly you won't have
10:09 - something like this in every react site
10:12 - that you
10:14 - do at least not not in the same way that
10:16 - NEX does
10:18 - it the uh the only different thing we
10:21 - had from from previous shows is we've
10:24 - now added this import isomorphic
10:28 - fetch so so
10:31 - uh um I'm going to look back the live
10:34 - stream I'm going to ignore the live
10:36 - stream for a little bit just to get
10:38 - through some of this section and I'll
10:39 - check back in later so if you're asking
10:42 - a question and I don't respond right
10:43 - away I will I will towards the
10:47 - end so if you're not familiar with
10:51 - fetch fetch is kind of the newest way to
10:56 - make to make calls you know apis
11:00 - basically it's what you would have done
11:03 - with Ajax if you're using jQuery or just
11:05 - a normal
11:07 - xhr uh now you can use fetch for and
11:12 - it's super simple you'll see the code in
11:14 - a second when I when I type it
11:16 - out the only thing is it's not supported
11:19 - everywhere yet I mean obviously older
11:21 - browsers pretty much every version of
11:24 - Internet
11:25 - Explorer I mean that's that's not really
11:28 - new St
11:31 - uh later on I'm
11:33 - sure you know most browsers will have
11:36 - support but for right now you have to
11:37 - use polyfills for Fetch and in
11:40 - particular if we want to use Fetch with
11:42 - node on the server side we can't just
11:44 - use fetch you normally uh because it's
11:49 - it's normally a browser thing and node
11:50 - is not running in the
11:53 - browser so we use this uh npm module
11:56 - isomorphic fetch it actually it comes
11:59 - packaged with next uh so that's why we
12:02 - can just use it like this I didn't have
12:04 - to install it separately if if you
12:07 - looked at the package Json file it's
12:09 - it's not in the list of things so it's
12:11 - nice that it comes with this there are
12:13 - some newer npm modules uh that do this
12:17 - as
12:18 - well uh fetch works for me I might check
12:22 - out some of the uh isomorph morphic
12:24 - fetch works for me I might check out
12:25 - some of the new ones later on if I think
12:28 - uh it'll provide Advantage if you know
12:30 - of any of you know newer versions of
12:33 - this uh that you like you know let me
12:36 - know let me know what's good about
12:40 - them so let's get started I'm just going
12:43 - to start typing out what we
12:46 - need
12:49 - so next comes
12:54 - with this get initial
12:57 - props uh
12:59 - function that's anything inside get
13:02 - initial props that's going to run on the
13:05 - server
13:07 - side so that call is going to run but
13:09 - then if you switch over to client side
13:11 - routing later
13:12 - on it'll also run that you know when
13:15 - you're doing so with next you can do
13:19 - server side first then switch to client
13:22 - side once things are loaded you can just
13:23 - stick with server side so that every
13:26 - every time you click a link it's a
13:28 - complete page refresh you know you can
13:30 - kind you do it however you want to do it
13:32 - you can do custom
13:34 - routing but right now we're going to
13:36 - start
13:39 - with and this is pretty basic this is
13:42 - pretty much how it is in the next
13:43 - documentation so you can check that out
13:45 - too if you want to learn more about
13:48 - it we need to get initial
13:53 - props okay and just you I think you'll
13:56 - be really amazed at how simple this is I
13:58 - know I was uh because I like I said I I
14:01 - tried for a long time to get server side
14:03 - routing to work with react and I just
14:06 - couldn't
14:07 - find I couldn't find a good tutorial
14:09 - that was at my level at the time you
14:12 - know sometimes you find a tutorial and
14:14 - it's just it's just too advanced you
14:17 - know uh but this was you know this was
14:20 - at my level when I needed
14:22 - it all right so I'm just going to make a
14:24 - couple of variables here if you're not
14:27 - familiar with this syntax you've using
14:29 - const instead of ver uh this is es6
14:33 - syntax or ex
14:36 - 2015 so this is
14:38 - just I mean a short explanation is when
14:41 - I make something a const it's never
14:43 - going to change I I can't I can't change
14:46 - this uh this variable later
14:49 - on uh there's some other things with
14:51 - with hoisting that happens when you use
14:53 - con or let uh but let kind of beond what
14:59 - we're talking about
15:00 - today all right so we we're going to use
15:03 - a URL and I'm going to just I'm going to
15:05 - copy and paste in that URL that I showed
15:07 - you just a minute ago where we're going
15:10 - to get that data so I like to you can
15:14 - type the URL straight into your your
15:16 - fetch uh function but I like to keep it
15:20 - a little bit more clean with some
15:21 - variables
15:29 - and I usually like to have my parameters
15:32 - separate it's not going to be really
15:34 - obvious right now why we need that but
15:37 - later
15:38 - on we're going to have like some really
15:41 - long strings of parameters they're going
15:43 - to add to this so it's better to
15:45 - separate them and easier to read uh so
15:47 - for now we can just
15:50 - add we just add posts because the demo
15:53 - uh WordPress site that I'm going to pull
15:55 - this data from it only has post right
15:57 - now uh later on we set up WordPress to
16:00 - have lots of custom post types and and
16:02 - we'll pull different
16:04 - things and now we're going to get to you
16:08 - know these first two variables this was
16:10 - just kind of the way I organize things
16:12 - now we're getting to you know the part
16:15 - the important part that you really
16:19 - need so this this uh syntax this part of
16:24 - it the next three lines are going to be
16:26 - pretty much straight
16:27 - from uh
16:30 - nextjs straight from their
16:33 - documentation wait let's
16:45 - see okay so this is it for fetch I mean
16:49 - think back if you've done especially if
16:52 - you've worked with xhr or
16:55 - Ajax think about how many lines it took
16:59 - you to accomplish an API
17:02 - call this is all you need
17:05 - now and if I didn't put them in you know
17:09 - these variables here you you could just
17:11 - put this whole URL right here it's it's
17:16 - so much
17:17 - simpler so if you haven't used fetch yet
17:20 - use it I may do a a tutorial video later
17:24 - on about how to set up your site to be
17:27 - able to use fetch in the browser and
17:30 - support older browsers uh and how to set
17:32 - up that
17:40 - polyfill I just glanced over at the live
17:42 - chat somebody asked a good question uh
17:45 - why is the head in the metadata inside
17:47 - that div yeah
17:50 - so this is weird to have a div here
17:53 - but I needed to have
17:57 - everything so basically I needed to have
17:59 - the body tag have these styles on
18:03 - it but I have no way at least no way
18:06 - that I know of with this setup to
18:09 - directly put something on the body tag
18:12 - so instead of looking it up and trying
18:13 - to figure out how to do it I thought I'd
18:15 - just try putting a div here around
18:17 - everything and see if it works and it
18:19 - did work
18:21 - so I would guess that there's a better
18:23 - way to do this but since I have such a
18:26 - short timeline for getting this site
18:29 - live I'm just going to stick with this
18:31 - for now because it works and then
18:33 - hopefully later on find a better way to
18:36 - do it but this looks a little weird but
18:39 - it it does actually
18:41 - work all right so let's finish this off
18:44 - right we're going to get Json
18:50 - back all right so we're going to save
18:52 - that in a variable called Data you can
18:54 - call that whatever you want
19:01 - okay and then all we're going to do now
19:02 - is just
19:05 - return we're going to turn that data
19:08 - okay now what this is going to do is
19:09 - this data is now going to be available
19:12 - as a
19:15 - prop so we can go down
19:18 - here and you yesterday we I explained
19:21 - how to use
19:22 - props so it's basically going to be the
19:25 - same the same concept here we're going
19:28 - to add this data is a prop prop but I'm
19:30 - going to
19:31 - do I'm going to show you how how I will
19:35 - be using
19:36 - this I'm usually not going to make an
19:38 - API call to just pull one piece of
19:41 - data I'm going to make an API call to
19:44 - pull a bunch of stuff in this case a
19:45 - bunch of posts and I want to Loop
19:48 - through all those
19:50 - posts and then render them you know a
19:52 - big list of
19:54 - them so I'm just going to type
19:56 - everything here for Simplicity normally
19:57 - you'd want to make another component and
20:00 - pass it to the component and we'll see
20:01 - that later on but for
20:04 - now we don't need all that uh we just
20:07 - want to make sure that this works make
20:08 - sure we get everything on the page that
20:10 - we need so we'll go
20:13 - this
20:15 - props and if I am going too fast I'll
20:18 - answer some questions in a little
20:23 - bit uh the same person asked the
20:25 - question about the div uh around
20:28 - everything thing says as long as we all
20:30 - agree that it's a hack definitely it is
20:32 - a
20:33 - hack but uh sometimes that's the way it
20:36 - is you just you need to get it done and
20:38 - you need to get it done very quickly so
20:40 - you have to resort to a
20:44 - hack so let's go this props and then
20:47 - data right so we named that data and we
20:50 - could have named it whatever we
20:52 - wanted but data is a nice kind of
20:54 - generic
20:56 - term and we we want to use
21:04 - map so we're going to use map a map
21:07 - function and we're going to we're going
21:10 - to call it a post since we're getting
21:12 - posts it makes sense you can call this
21:14 - whatever you want so that each time they
21:17 - Loop through a different piece a
21:20 - different piece of data that's going to
21:21 - be a different Post in our case we'll
21:23 - probably name this something different
21:25 - when we start using custom post types
21:27 - for each different post type we'll name
21:29 - it that that helps keep keep things
21:31 - pretty clear I'm also going to put this
21:34 - variable here just uh to keep track of
21:37 - what number we're on you'll see why I'm
21:38 - going to use that in a
21:41 - second and all we need
21:44 - now I need now is just to put in some of
21:47 - the HTML that's going to contain this
21:49 - data so we want to return and if you're
21:52 - not familiar at all with react all we
21:53 - just did here when we put this this
21:55 - curly bracket here is
21:59 - and now anything inside these curly
22:01 - brackets is Javascript we can type plain
22:03 - JavaScript in here so we've kind of
22:07 - started with
22:08 - JavaScript inside this this return now
22:12 - we're it's basically HTML with with a
22:16 - few differences but pretty much straight
22:19 - HTML and then now we've dropped back
22:22 - into JavaScript inside of here so if we
22:25 - want to Output HTML again we need to
22:28 - return it
22:29 - so we're just going to add another
22:31 - return and we're going to just start out
22:33 - we're just going to make a div to hold
22:35 - this data uh we're going to give it a
22:37 - class name you can't just put
22:42 - class uh you you'll get an error if you
22:44 - try to just put class you need to put
22:46 - class name there are a few other
22:49 - properties that you need to do some
22:52 - different things with uh Source set is
22:54 - one of them you have to type SRC and
22:57 - then capital
22:59 - C uh if you you're making a form or
23:01 - something and you use the four
23:04 - attribute uh I think you have to do HTML
23:07 - for with a capital f so uh I think they
23:11 - have all those listed on the react
23:12 - website just you know which which
23:15 - properties are supported uh but if
23:17 - you're getting weird
23:19 - errors it's for me at least a lot of my
23:22 - erors are resulting from forgetting to
23:24 - put class name instead of class
23:28 - so let's give this we'll just make this
23:30 - a row we're using materialized
23:37 - framework so a lot of these styles are
23:40 - built into that framework and then now
23:43 - here's where that that I variable is
23:45 - going to come
23:46 - in for react likes to have a key if
23:51 - you're going to have you know a bunch of
23:53 - divs that all have kind of the same
23:55 - thing in them that you're you're
23:57 - iterating over they like to have key so
23:59 - Oops I messed that up I don't want it to
24:01 - be a string I want it to be a
24:03 - variable uh so let's drop down so you
24:07 - see notice now we're in that return
24:09 - again so if I want to do JavaScript I do
24:11 - have to put these brackets again it can
24:13 - get confusing we're switching back and
24:15 - forth between you know what looks like
24:17 - HTML and
24:20 - JavaScript so we're just going to close
24:22 - that we're going to close that div
24:25 - inside that div we're just going to make
24:27 - an H1 you know just a normal H1
24:31 - tag uh to have our our title remember we
24:34 - just want to get the title of the post
24:35 - and the content so we're going to go
24:37 - post see so now that now that we're in
24:39 - here and we've
24:40 - named we've named this post we can just
24:44 - go straight into post and inside the
24:47 - post we want to get the
24:50 - title all right title and then if you
24:52 - remember it actually dropped down One
24:54 - More Level so the way WordPress uh
24:56 - formats the Json you can't just say
24:59 - title you have to go to
25:05 - rendered and that's that's it we that
25:08 - should output the title now for our
25:11 - content I'm going to do something a
25:12 - little bit different and I'll I'll
25:14 - explain
25:17 - why I'm going to give this a class of
25:20 - flow text materialize has this flow text
25:24 - class that resizes the text BAS based on
25:28 - your screen with kind of responsive font
25:31 - thing uh and that'll make the text a
25:33 - little bit more readable for us but I'm
25:36 - not going to put the data here I'm
25:40 - actually going
25:41 - to use this and this is not as scary as
25:44 - it
25:54 - sounds all right so I'm going to use
25:56 - dangerously set iner HTM ml so we're
25:59 - dropping back down into JavaScript here
26:02 - to do
26:05 - this okay so this is built into
26:19 - react I can't spell
26:22 - today okay so let me explain why we're
26:25 - doing this
26:29 - I will pull let's pull this back this uh
26:33 - this data back in I'm gonna flip switch
26:35 - over really
26:39 - quick let me make it a little bit bigger
26:42 - so since we're we're trying to pull this
26:44 - content rendered if you notice there is
26:47 - HTML in here all right there's a P
26:51 - tag in here and there there could be
26:54 - anything right this is WordPress so you
26:57 - somebody could type type in you know all
27:00 - a lot of different tags think if you had
27:02 - like uls you know unordered lists you
27:05 - know Lis you you know you could see
27:07 - there could be a lot of HTML if we just
27:10 - put
27:11 - this here like we did for the title
27:15 - we're going to see that markup and we
27:16 - don't want to see that
27:19 - markup uh I'm just checking out the live
27:23 - stream yeah I know this this seems
27:25 - pretty harsh but
27:28 - if you have control of where you're
27:31 - getting the data
27:33 - from and you know what's going to be put
27:35 - in there because you're the one that's
27:36 - going to be putting it in there or you
27:39 - know somebody in your on your team that
27:41 - you trust then there's really nothing
27:43 - wrong with doing
27:46 - this if you're just pulling in data from
27:49 - some other source that you have no
27:50 - control
27:51 - over yeah then maybe you might want you
27:54 - might want to think about not doing this
27:57 - uh you know so
27:58 - you might end up pulling in some some
28:01 - harmful code you don't want to do it but
28:02 - in this
28:03 - case you know this this WordPress site
28:07 - is on it's on my
28:09 - servers I'm actually the only person at
28:11 - this point that even has access to the
28:13 - admin
28:14 - panel so so it's okay it's it's not as
28:19 - it's it's not as crazy as it sounds it's
28:22 - it just sounds really harsh to put that
28:23 - in there all right
28:25 - so but you can see why we need to do
28:28 - that because we're going to have HTML
28:31 - tags inside this content so we need to
28:34 - render those tags as well all right so
28:37 - I'm going to save this and then I'm
28:39 - going to show you the
28:42 - page
28:43 - and we're going to see all right now I'm
28:47 - going to bring this in and as as it I
28:49 - said at the beginning I want you to see
28:51 - all my
28:54 - mistakes so you can see
28:58 - we have a mistake it's saying cannot
29:01 - read property map of undefined so
29:03 - somehow I've messed up in the API call
29:06 - so let's check this out I do want to
29:08 - just refresh this quickly to
29:12 - see here's a
29:15 - tip I've I've had this happen to me so
29:18 - many times I'm not sure
29:19 - why when I just hit save and it does the
29:22 - hot
29:24 - reload sometimes things don't work so
29:27 - before you start to
29:30 - despair do do a
29:34 - refresh sometimes it will actually work
29:37 - after the refresh and for whatever
29:39 - reason it just didn't work I'm sure
29:41 - there's some good
29:42 - reason why the the hot reload you know
29:45 - doesn't work for some
29:47 - things
29:49 - but I'm glad that worked and and we
29:51 - tried that before I went back in so if
29:53 - you can see this part part that was
29:55 - blank before now
29:59 - has our titles I'm using the bacon
30:03 - ipsum for this uh test data that has all
30:06 - our titles and then it
30:08 - has our
30:11 - content he and that's how you pull in
30:15 - data I want to let's look
30:17 - at let's view this
30:21 - Source oh this is going to be ugly I
30:23 - don't know if we'll be able to get to it
30:25 - but basically if you view the source you
30:27 - know you'll see all the HTML there here
30:29 - we go you know you see all this HTML
30:32 - here normally if you have a page that's
30:37 - making an API call and it's on the
30:39 - client side you know you won't see all
30:41 - the markup in in a view Source you'll
30:43 - see it if you inspect it in Dev tools
30:45 - but not of VI source so this just shows
30:48 - this is what search engines will see
30:50 - they're seeing all your data
30:59 - okay before I go to the live chat I just
31:02 - want to ask you guys you notice this is
31:04 - different from what it was a couple days
31:06 - ago it used to have an overlay this kind
31:10 - of white overlay over the entire image
31:12 - and then the title was centered
31:14 - vertically and
31:17 - horizontally I liked how that looked but
31:20 - after a meeting with the people I'm
31:23 - making the site for they wanted to see
31:27 - the full color of this image they didn't
31:30 - want this overlay on it at
31:34 - all I don't really want to put the title
31:37 - down here and have you know forced the
31:41 - rest of the content even farther down
31:42 - the page I mean because let's see you
31:44 - know normal screen is going to be more
31:47 - like like this for most
31:49 - people so you can see it's already kind
31:51 - of messed up the formatting I do have it
31:54 - zoomed in
31:55 - though let me take that back down down
31:58 - to normal size okay so my question to
32:02 - you
32:03 - is I don't like how this I don't like
32:06 - how this looks
32:07 - obviously do you know some way that we
32:11 - can still make this
32:13 - readable and also keep the image you
32:17 - know for the most part without an
32:20 - overlay so I'm thinking maybe of like
32:22 - having this fade a little bit more we'll
32:25 - see I've thought about just removing
32:27 - this section entirely and just having a
32:29 - title and then trying to work these
32:31 - images in some other way so let me know
32:34 - in in the
32:35 - comments uh or you know here in the live
32:38 - chat I would I'd really appreciate your
32:41 - opinion on that I've already spent a lot
32:44 - more time than I wanted to just kind of
32:46 - trying things out and nothing has
32:49 - nothing has has looked right to
32:53 - me all right so now if uh if you don't
32:57 - want to stick around for me to go
32:58 - through the questions in the live chat
33:00 - Now's the Time to Leave it's already
33:02 - been a half an hour otherwise if you
33:04 - have a little bit more time I'm going to
33:05 - go through the live chat uh I'm going to
33:08 - read out where everybody's from and I'm
33:11 - going to answer questions if you have
33:13 - any questions that you didn't get in the
33:14 - live chat you can put them in the
33:17 - comments if you don't want to put your
33:19 - question in the comments for everybody
33:20 - to read just uh direct message me on
33:24 - Twitter uh my link to my Twitter account
33:27 - is in the descript
33:30 - description all right so I'm scrolling
33:32 - up to the top now of the live
33:35 - chat and let's see we
33:38 - have someone from
33:41 - Guatemala and people saying
33:43 - congratulations thanks for saying
33:44 - congratulations if you missed at the
33:46 - beginning it's I said it's my 10-year uh
33:48 - wedding anniversary today so uh thanks
33:52 - for the the congratulations
33:56 - guys so from
33:59 - laia Cherry Valley Illinois Columbia
34:03 - Charleston London England
34:05 - Baghdad Atlanta Tokyo Canada
34:11 - Brazil uh it's B Horizon
34:16 - Brazil Cordova Argentina
34:20 - Albania okay we have a question what's
34:23 - the difference between isomorphic Fetch
34:26 - and a normal request to an API so uh
34:30 - Marius asked asked this question so a
34:33 - normal request what normally I I don't
34:36 - know about you but I would say all the
34:39 - API requests that I had done up until
34:41 - the point when I started using react in
34:43 - this way was I just made it on the
34:45 - client side so usually I would use Ajax
34:49 - because most of the sites I worked on
34:51 - were already loading jQuery for some
34:53 - other reason so I would just use
34:55 - Ajax and I would make the request like
34:57 - that I did start to switch over and use
35:00 - fetch but all those were on the client
35:04 - side
35:06 - so everything would would load you know
35:09 - the JavaScript would load on the page
35:11 - and then the call would be made but
35:14 - search engines couldn't see the data
35:16 - from that call when we're using
35:17 - isomorphic fetch isomorphic is a term
35:19 - that's used at least in uh in web
35:23 - development to mean that uh it's like
35:27 - something that runs on the client and
35:28 - the server both uh sometimes they call
35:31 - it Universal uh so you'll hear those
35:34 - kind of used
35:36 - interchangeably but to say it's an is
35:39 - isomorphic fetch just means that it is
35:41 - it is fetch so it's it's basically a
35:45 - newer version of an Ajax call that can
35:49 - run on the server in this case it's
35:52 - running uh we're running node on the
35:54 - server so it's a version of fetch
35:58 - that can run on
36:01 - node and that's necessary as I mentioned
36:04 - earlier to be able to render all the
36:07 - content that you want the uh the search
36:10 - engines to see on the server and then
36:13 - send it all all out on that first load
36:17 - so hopefully that that answered your
36:18 - question uh if not you know uh comment
36:22 - and uh I can answer it in more depth
36:25 - later on all right we got somebody from
36:27 - South Africa said they're enjoying the
36:29 - stream thanks I'm glad you're enjoying
36:31 - it
36:35 - Kazakhstan PESA Brazil sorry if I'm
36:39 - mispronouncing the places that you're
36:40 - from I'm trying my best
36:44 - India all right somebody from India says
36:48 - uh I'll I'll try to pronounce AB abishek
36:51 - from
36:52 - India is saying that these videos keep
36:56 - me a hell of lot motivated and helps
36:59 - keep the procrastination on hold awesome
37:01 - I'm really glad to hear that uh I'm
37:03 - pretty much I'll only keep doing these
37:06 - if I think you guys are getting some
37:08 - benefit and sorry guys guys and girls I
37:12 - I don't mean any offense by using that
37:15 - uh so
37:18 - um yeah so let me know if you guys think
37:21 - if you people think that that it's uh
37:24 - useful to you you know please let me
37:26 - know and and that's motivation for me to
37:28 - keep doing it and try to do a better job
37:30 - if you have any advice for me on how to
37:32 - make these better please let me
37:34 - know okay somebody says so don't use
37:37 - react router when during stra side
37:39 - rendering yeah I haven't worked with
37:41 - react router enough to even be able to
37:43 - address
37:44 - that because next handles a lot of the
37:47 - routing we're going to do a little bit
37:48 - of custom routing and we'll get into
37:50 - that probably next
37:52 - week but I I don't know enough about it
37:55 - so I can't really comment on that
37:58 - what place is your desktop background
38:00 - image from what is my desktop background
38:02 - image right now
38:06 - um I don't know this maybe this is the
38:09 - default that comes with Mac so I'm using
38:12 - uh Mac uh OS 10 Sierra as the operating
38:15 - system so I guess that's the default I
38:19 - don't know let me know if anybody else
38:20 - is using that I think that's the default
38:23 - uh and I'm assuming it's that they're
38:25 - talking about the Sierra Nevada mountain
38:27 - range is here in the
38:29 - US I I don't really know usually the
38:32 - last couple operating systems for Mac
38:34 - have been named after mountains and then
38:36 - the default image is that
38:39 - mountain okay we had some stuff I
38:42 - answered some of
38:45 - this okay somebody said we can move the
38:47 - head into header. JS
38:50 - component that's what I thought so I
38:53 - actually tried to move the stuff in the
38:55 - header let me bring that over so we know
38:57 - know what we're talking about
38:59 - so uh so we had somebody in the live
39:02 - chat
39:03 - mention that we can move all this this
39:05 - head stuff into a
39:11 - component I tried so here's what I tried
39:13 - to do I moved all this to a component
39:15 - and then I just loaded that component
39:18 - here and it it didn't
39:20 - work basically the the page actually did
39:23 - load I didn't get you know the the pink
39:25 - error screen but all this stuff that I
39:29 - was trying to bring in the stylesheets
39:33 - and the fonts none of them loaded
39:36 - neither the the title didn't load none
39:38 - of this loaded so I don't know what the
39:41 - problem is I I would definitely like to
39:43 - just put this all on a
39:46 - component the one reason why I don't
39:50 - mind it being here is that I can
39:52 - customize this although I certainly
39:55 - could have that as a prop in the
39:56 - component and that in
39:58 - so uh one thing I could try that I
40:02 - didn't think about until now is you know
40:04 - what if I just copied all of this
40:06 - including this this head component into
40:09 - a component and then I imported this
40:13 - next head into that
40:16 - component I don't know that might work
40:18 - I'm GNA have to try that so thanks for
40:20 - uh for mentioning that because it kind
40:23 - of made me rethink what I did and
40:25 - realize maybe there is a way to make it
40:28 - work so I'll maybe I'll try that uh
40:31 - after the live stream
40:34 - today
40:39 - okay uh mobin 92 says I see that the
40:42 - site includes the stylesheets fonts and
40:45 - scripts do we have to do that for every
40:47 - page again and again isn't there some
40:49 - kind of templating mechanism oh yeah I
40:51 - mean that's
40:53 - basically uh kind of like the last
40:56 - comment
40:58 - yeah I think there should be a better
41:00 - way to do
41:01 - this I was reading through the nextjs
41:05 - documentation to see if there was
41:07 - something like that I think I remember
41:09 - reading at some point about some layout
41:12 - component and I'm assuming that it can
41:15 - do something like that I just need to
41:18 - read more into it uh from the last time
41:20 - I used nextjs on a project they've had a
41:24 - lot of updates and a lot of new features
41:26 - so I need to go back in and kind of
41:29 - relearn it you know what what are the
41:31 - best ways to use it now so at the time
41:34 - when I first used it I didn't find a
41:37 - better way to do this for right now
41:40 - since I don't have that many pages it's
41:42 - faster for me to just do this but if I
41:44 - had a larger site I would definitely try
41:46 - to figure out some way to just put this
41:49 - in a component have it you know
41:51 - templating like you said uh but for now
41:56 - you know once again because because of
41:57 - the very short time frame that the site
41:59 - needs to launch I'm probably not going
42:01 - to have time to find the answer to this
42:03 - and to really mess with it I I kind of I
42:05 - wish I had more time to really do this
42:08 - you know the best way that I
42:12 - can okay side effect and
42:17 - react okay we
42:19 - have from side effect and
42:23 - react app I use Redux Saga or Redux
42:26 - stunk I've heard about
42:28 - Redux I haven't worked with Redux yet
42:31 - but I've heard a lot of good things
42:32 - about it watched some videos on it so uh
42:36 - yeah definitely I from the little I know
42:38 - about it I can recommend it as as being
42:40 - something uh really useful to use with
42:44 - react okay almost to the bottom of the
42:47 - live
42:51 - chat um I'm seeing the comments now when
42:54 - I use that dangerously set enter HTML
42:58 - someone says they uh they hate WordPress
43:00 - but need
43:01 - WordPress I have I have a somewhat
43:04 - similar feeling about WordPress I like
43:08 - how easy it is for people who don't know
43:10 - code to edit things in
43:13 - WordPress and that's why I use it in
43:16 - this case that that is kind of why I'm
43:17 - using it because we're going to have
43:20 - some uh some graduate students who are
43:23 - going to who don't know anything about
43:24 - code are going to need to input some
43:25 - data
43:28 - but I don't really like working with the
43:29 - PHP and the uh the templating system
43:33 - within WordPress and I'm not I'm not
43:36 - really interested in leveling up my PHP
43:38 - skills at this point I'd rather work on
43:41 - my JavaScript
43:43 - skills
43:46 - so that's why I'm using Wordpress like
43:49 - this if there were some kind of less
43:52 - heavy content management system that I
43:54 - could pull data from that was as stable
43:58 - and as userfriendly as WordPress I would
44:00 - definitely try that
44:06 - out as I scroll down now it's uh seems
44:09 - like the same reason they said they use
44:11 - it for clients and that's actually that
44:13 - that's it uh it's it's really easy for
44:15 - clients to to
44:17 - manage someone ask Anthony Lopez ask why
44:19 - is coding so
44:22 - fun uh I think coding is fun
44:27 - CU you're building something you're
44:28 - building something that usually helps
44:31 - people in some way you can build things
44:34 - that are are
44:36 - beautiful when you build you get
44:38 - immediate feedback which is really
44:40 - awesome and if you mess it up it usually
44:41 - it doesn't cost you anything you
44:44 - just you know you just undo whatever you
44:46 - did you go back to the last commit so
44:50 - that's really cool other you know I I
44:52 - enjoy building
44:53 - things in in the real world too but but
44:58 - you know if you're if you mess something
44:59 - up when you're building things in the
45:00 - real world world then you usually can't
45:02 - reuse it and you have to go buy more
45:04 - materials I I think it's awesome that
45:07 - you can just try things out when you're
45:09 - building a website or an app and not
45:12 - have to worry about messing it up you
45:14 - know you just make another Branch for
45:17 - your code you know with Git try out
45:19 - whatever crazy thing you want to do if
45:21 - it works awesome if it doesn't work well
45:23 - you just go back to you know your
45:25 - original branch and you know leave it
45:27 - for later on try to figure it out later
45:29 - I think you know that's that's cool for
45:31 - me and I really like learning uh
45:33 - learning all the the latest
45:36 - stuff so I don't know maybe it's not
45:38 - like that for everybody but at least for
45:40 - me that's you know that's what I can
45:42 - think of in just in a minute or two here
45:46 - of why I like coding so
45:49 - much somebody asked if it's a pretty
45:51 - common practice so Joey ask is it pretty
45:53 - common practice to just use WordPress
45:55 - for its backend API and build your own
45:57 - front end I don't think it's common
46:00 - yet so I first heard about
46:04 - this probably maybe two years ago or
46:07 - maybe a year and a half ago
46:10 - and it wasn't really common they were
46:14 - saying that the WordPress API at that
46:16 - point wasn't stable and it could change
46:19 - so you really shouldn't use it but I
46:21 - found some sites that were actually
46:22 - using it you know in production so I
46:25 - decided to give it a shot and I built a
46:27 - few sites with it that are they're
46:29 - actually live and and they're working
46:31 - well and they have been working you know
46:33 - with with no no
46:36 - downtime for
46:38 - months I've had no problem with it so
46:42 - yeah it's not common yet but I
46:44 - definitely think it it could end up
46:46 - being common I'd actually I have a
46:48 - project in mind to make a very easy way
46:51 - for people who use WordPress to use
46:55 - react as kind of the front end without
46:58 - them having to know that much about
47:00 - react so it would be limited in that it
47:02 - would you basically be limited to your
47:04 - your default pages and posts in
47:06 - WordPress but they would really just
47:08 - need to plug in
47:10 - their their URL and then the react part
47:14 - of it would just kind of take over and
47:17 - and put out the data so it would be it
47:20 - would be easier for people they would
47:22 - have to still know a little bit about
47:24 - you a little bit of JavaScript but it
47:27 - would be much easier than trying to do
47:28 - it all yourself so maybe I'll get i'll
47:31 - get to the point where I have some time
47:32 - to to make that and uh maybe maybe you
47:36 - can help me out with that I I'll
47:37 - certainly H have that the Open Source on
47:39 - GitHub if I do
47:47 - it okay almost to the
47:52 - bottom I was almost to the bottom maybe
47:55 - I think I had some more some more people
47:57 - typing in and now the bottom is getting
48:00 - farther away of this of this live
48:03 - chat all right so okay now thanks for
48:08 - all this advice on the uh the text the
48:10 - title text maybe fade the size I'm yeah
48:13 - I'm going to try that so Anthony
48:15 - suggested maybe fade the sides maybe
48:17 - another black bar under the image with
48:19 - the white text in
48:20 - it make it
48:24 - black put a background on only the
48:27 - text yeah yeah I see what you guys are
48:30 - saying I'll try I'll definitely try
48:32 - these out change the color drop shadow
48:35 - yeah I've done that before I really hate
48:37 - to add a drop shadow since I'm not using
48:38 - it anywhere else but um I I'll have to
48:42 - try these out and see what they look
48:44 - like I think that that oval fade maybe
48:47 - maybe that would work
48:50 - too okay so somebody asks MJS versus
48:54 - nextjs
48:57 - I don't have enough experience with M to
49:00 - comment on that I like
49:03 - nextjs they seem to add new features
49:05 - really quickly and be really responsive
49:08 - uh on GitHub when you raise an
49:10 - issue so I I don't have a problem with
49:13 - it there are some things about next
49:15 - that I wish it could do that it can't
49:18 - right now or it's possible I I just
49:21 - don't know how to do it and I'll
49:23 - probably get to some of those things
49:24 - maybe next week in the videos or the
49:26 - week after after uh but I don't know I
49:29 - don't really know very much at all about
49:30 - M so guess you fill me in in the
49:32 - comments and let me know what you think
49:36 - so we have somebody from Romania from
49:38 - Poland Orlando Philippines India New
49:43 - Jersey uh Saudi Arabia India
49:49 - Russia okay we have a question here from
49:54 - Josh so Josh began coding about one week
49:57 - ago any advice for feeling overwhelmed
49:59 - at the beginning and not giving up oh
50:01 - man yeah
50:04 - uh that feeling of being overwhelmed
50:07 - will you'll have that even after you're
50:11 - not a beginner anymore but it gets
50:13 - better you don't have it as often and
50:16 - you kind of know how to push through
50:19 - it don't feel like you have to learn
50:21 - everything all at
50:23 - once if you watch a YouTube video or or
50:26 - you know read a a blog post on some
50:29 - concept and you're just totally lost
50:31 - don't worry about it watch it again
50:33 - watch it two or three times practice a
50:36 - little bit and then go come back to it
50:38 - it'll be a great feeling for you when
50:40 - you come back to a video that made no
50:41 - sense to you you know a month or two ago
50:44 - and now you totally understand it so I
50:47 - would say just keep trying don't don't
50:49 - try to do things that are Way Beyond
50:51 - your level you know take it kind of
50:54 - slower uh don't be
50:57 - I'm I'm always going back and doing
50:59 - tutorials that are like beginner
51:02 - tutorials and I usually fly through a
51:04 - lot of the stuff but I always pick up
51:06 - something useful that I didn't know so
51:09 - I'd say you know don't don't have too
51:11 - much pride to uh you know to go back to
51:15 - the beginning and kind of try to relearn
51:18 - some things you'll always pick up
51:19 - something new I mean don't spend all
51:20 - your time in the beginner tutorials but
51:23 - uh I I'm I'm with you and feeling over
51:26 - overwhelmed at times usually at some
51:30 - point in a project I I hit a point where
51:32 - I just
51:33 - think like how did I get myself to this
51:36 - point how am I ever going to get this
51:37 - done on time and have it
51:40 - work and you can't give up you know you
51:43 - still got to you you got to ship the
51:45 - site you know it has to go live you know
51:47 - you're being paid to do that so you just
51:50 - work through it just break it up into
51:52 - small
51:54 - tasks use resource online you stack
51:58 - Overflow uh ask questions you know on
52:01 - YouTube videos and if you know somebody
52:04 - else who codes have them take a look at
52:05 - your code but I mean I guess the the
52:09 - best advice I could give you is
52:11 - just don't give up and realize that the
52:14 - overwhelm feeling is is
52:16 - normal and you'll get better and that
52:18 - feeling will slowly start to go away and
52:20 - not be as bad so hopefully that
52:23 - helps all right we have somebody from
52:25 - Salvador Brazil
52:27 - also you know if anybody else has any uh
52:30 - advice for someone just starting out
52:31 - feeling overwhelmed please post that in
52:33 - the
52:34 - comments somebody from
52:39 - Seattle
52:42 - turkey okay so we have some people some
52:45 - people commenting back uh saying take
52:47 - Little
52:48 - Steps somebody else knows the
52:51 - feeling uh oh someone said is it
52:53 - inspired me watching you well thanks I I
52:56 - appre appreciate that I'm glad it it's
52:58 - providing some value to you uh please
53:01 - save this stream yeah all the streams
53:03 - somebody just said please save the
53:05 - stream all the streams pretty much like
53:08 - five minutes after the stream is over
53:10 - they go um they're available on the free
53:13 - code Camp Channel I do have some other
53:15 - videos on my own channel and that's
53:17 - Linked In the description I'm going to
53:18 - do some pre-recorded tutorials and put
53:20 - that on that channel as well but I'm
53:22 - probably not going to have time until
53:23 - after this launch the site launches
53:25 - later this month and then and uh so if
53:27 - you have any requests for tutorials
53:29 - that'll be kind of shorter more to the
53:31 - point tutorials uh let me know if if you
53:34 - want to learn about anything and and if
53:36 - I know about it I'll make a
53:39 - video well what can you do if you have
53:41 - many pages so somebody uh uh mobin 92
53:45 - asked about what can you do if you have
53:46 - many pages and I think this is referring
53:48 - back to that you know having all the uh
53:52 - the whole content of the head tag in
53:55 - every page I I don't know the answer to
53:57 - that right
53:59 - now I'm I'm assuming there is an answer
54:02 - and I just don't know it yet and I
54:04 - haven't taken the time to try to find it
54:07 - yet same style that menu okay so we have
54:12 - another recommendation for the nav menu
54:15 - uh I'll just I'll skip over those for
54:17 - now and I'll I'll read them because
54:18 - that's more of advice directly to me and
54:20 - I'll try out these different
54:24 - things all right we have another
54:26 - question
54:28 - mads Jensen is
54:30 - asking studying web development at my
54:32 - school but when I showed them the
54:34 - website free code Camp they said that
54:36 - they coded wrong so I'm so confused they
54:38 - say you use too much too much div HMO
54:43 - 5 uh yeah I don't I don't know what to
54:47 - say I'm not
54:48 - sure if you're using something like
54:52 - bootstrap or like I'm using materialized
54:55 - sometimes
54:56 - that's the way you have to do it you use
54:59 - you use a lot of divs I'm sure there's
55:01 - different philosophies on how you should
55:03 - structure your
55:05 - HTML I don't know that I'm in a position
55:07 - to comment on which one is the best or
55:09 - which one's right or
55:10 - wrong I mean to me at the end of the day
55:15 - you got to make a site that's
55:16 - userfriendly to your users if it's also
55:19 - coded beautifully so that somebody can
55:20 - look at your code and it's awesome then
55:22 - that's great too but uh especially if
55:25 - you're just starting out which people
55:26 - who are using free code Camp are usually
55:28 - just starting
55:30 - out I don't know it maybe I don't know
55:33 - if this is good advice or not but I
55:35 - would say don't worry as much about your
55:37 - style of coating don't don't fret about
55:39 - indentation and how many divs you're
55:41 - using try to learn the basics try to
55:43 - make some cool stuff and get yourself
55:45 - excited about coding you know later on
55:48 - when you get a lot better you know then
55:50 - you can worry about those tiny details
55:53 - like that but uh I just uh to me I think
55:56 - sometimes people spend way too much time
55:58 - on those tiny little details that most
56:01 - people will never even notice in your
56:03 - code because the majority of people
56:05 - looking at your site are not developers
56:08 - so you guys can weigh in in the comments
56:10 - on that let me know if you
56:13 - disagree but I would say you know don't
56:16 - don't worry about that free code Camp's
56:17 - going to give you a lot of good advice
56:19 - and things
56:20 - and uh I'm I'm not sure why they're why
56:24 - they're saying that it's it's coded
56:34 - wrong
56:42 - okay I think we're at the end
56:45 - now is there any other of another
56:48 - question is there any other CMS solution
56:50 - you use in your projects besides
56:53 - WordPress I have used in the past I've
56:56 - used jumla and I've used
56:59 - Drupal I found uh both of them to be
57:03 - less userfriendly both for developers
57:05 - and for the clients so I don't use those
57:08 - unless I really have to like if I'm if I
57:11 - need to work on an existing site and I
57:14 - can't and it doesn't make sense to
57:16 - switch it
57:18 - over uh I have tried out some other like
57:21 - kind of newer really small content
57:23 - Management Systems there are some that
57:25 - actually are built with node that I'm
57:27 - really excited about but I haven't found
57:30 - one
57:31 - that's that's at that level that
57:33 - WordPress is of of just being refined
57:36 - and user friendly and stable you know
57:38 - nothing has as big of a user base to be
57:41 - able to ask questions to people
57:44 - so I'd really love to find something
57:47 - especially it'd be great if I could find
57:49 - a Content management system that was
57:51 - built with
57:52 - node I think that would be ideal because
57:56 - if you're already going to use node
57:57 - you're using JavaScript if you're going
57:59 - to work with react then you can just use
58:02 - JavaScript to work with your content
58:04 - management system as well uh it could be
58:07 - a lot more lightweight if you don't
58:08 - intend to actually have templating
58:10 - directly with that if you're just going
58:11 - to use it for the API so I'm I'm still
58:14 - kind of waiting for something to emerge
58:16 - as the front runner in that area of I
58:18 - guess what you would call a headless
58:20 - content management system where you just
58:22 - got things through the API and is built
58:25 - with JavaScript
58:26 - that would be awesome if anybody knows
58:28 - about something like that uh put in the
58:30 - comments please and uh I'll try it out
58:32 - when I get a
58:34 - chance okay somebody's asking about es6
58:38 - training um there's a lot of
58:41 - res I don't know off the top of my head
58:44 - uh where to send you for you know a good
58:46 - resource for es6 training I know there's
58:48 - a lot of good videos maybe
58:52 - um you know what if if you're still
58:55 - watching uh
58:57 - sorv kumars asked for es6 training if
59:00 - you're still watching make comment uh in
59:04 - this video and then I'll see that later
59:05 - on and maybe I can send you some links
59:08 - to some of the training stuff that I've
59:09 - used to learn
59:12 - es6 okay someone says yes that helped
59:14 - thank you so much oh you're welcome I'm
59:16 - glad it
59:17 - helped okay somebody said making your
59:19 - code readable is still important yes
59:21 - definitely uh it is definitely important
59:23 - to make your code readable
59:26 - um I would just and this is entirely my
59:29 - opinion but uh and this is this is
59:33 - coming from someone who primarily Works
59:35 - solo on projects I don't work with other
59:38 - people a lot right now on my projects so
59:41 - I rarely need to have other people look
59:42 - at my code so I'm in a different
59:45 - position than a lot of people who are
59:46 - working on a team where it's more
59:48 - important so you know take that into
59:51 - consideration with my advice but I would
59:54 - say the fol Focus for me is always on
59:58 - what is the user going to see and making
60:01 - that the best in second place in terms
60:04 - of priorities is making my code readable
60:07 - I'm not saying I ignore that part I do
60:09 - try to make it readable but if it's
60:11 - coming down to the wire and I only have
60:13 - I don't have time to do everything I'll
60:17 - always choose to make you know the user
60:19 - experience a little bit better at the
60:21 - expense of readability of the code and
60:24 - if I have time later I'll go back in and
60:26 - try to clean that up uh but that that's
60:29 - just
60:32 - me okay instead of Wordpress you can use
60:35 - ponzu written and go okay I haven't
60:38 - heard about ponzu so maybe I'll check
60:39 - that out thank
60:42 - you somebody asked if they should learn
60:44 - jQuery as soon as possible or learn
60:47 - first learn JS well I think it depends
60:50 - on what you want to do if you want to go
60:52 - and learn react don't worry about jQuery
60:56 - learn js's well if you need to make
60:59 - money right now and let's say you're
61:01 - doing some freelance work there are a
61:02 - lot of sites that use jQuery and if you
61:05 - want to work on those sites to update
61:07 - them you know then you'll need to know
61:10 - some
61:11 - jQuery so it really depends on where
61:13 - you're at if you know if you get hired
61:15 - somewhere and their site uses jQuery
61:17 - obviously you need to learn that so I
61:19 - don't really know where you're at but um
61:22 - if if you don't need to use jQuery right
61:25 - now then learn learn the basics of
61:27 - JavaScript okay but you never know I
61:29 - mean sometimes I I've done a lot of work
61:31 - that I didn't really want to do and um
61:35 - but you got to do it you got to pay the
61:37 - bills you got to feed your family so um
61:40 - you learn what you have to learn to do
61:42 - that so I'm I'm not going to judge you
61:44 - for uh for going with jQuery if you need
61:50 - to all right this is a good comment here
61:53 - and and we are actually TW Wards the end
61:57 - uh so John heiner says you'll pretty
61:59 - much find Dev saying everything and its
62:01 - opposite one of the misconceptions I
62:02 - think newbies have is that there is one
62:05 - way to do things but there's an ongoing
62:07 - debate about most things I I love that
62:10 - comment so John if you're still
62:11 - listening thank you that's that's a
62:13 - wonderful comment it's entirely right
62:15 - when I was really new I was always
62:17 - trying to find like what is the best way
62:19 - and I'd worry like should I be learning
62:21 - this is this the best thing is this the
62:23 - best way but that's not how it is
62:25 - there's there's so many ways of getting
62:27 - the same thing done it's more about your
62:30 - style and what you like to do or what
62:33 - your client needs at the time I'm a big
62:37 - advocate of using the tools the best
62:39 - tools that you know of for that
62:41 - particular job so you're not going to
62:44 - use you know let like I'm not going to
62:47 - use WordPress and react this combo for
62:49 - every single site that I do for every
62:51 - client that's not the answer sometimes
62:53 - you don't need that uh so
62:56 - you know don't don't be so worried about
62:59 - the absolute right way to do things uh
63:03 - you know you'll you'll eventually just
63:05 - keep doing keep learning and eventually
63:07 - you will find you'll get better and
63:10 - you'll find one of the best ways uh but
63:14 - like John said there's a debate about
63:17 - what the best way is
63:21 - usually okay let's see somebody asked if
63:24 - I'm selftaught this is officially my
63:26 - longest video ever so if you're still if
63:29 - anybody's still watching at this point
63:30 - we have well 55 viewers is that looking
63:33 - at the analytics so thanks for sticking
63:36 - around for so long um I'm GNA have to
63:38 - wrap this up soon because it's my
63:41 - anniversary and I want to get out of
63:42 - work here at a decent time but uh I'll
63:46 - answer these last couple questions are
63:47 - you self-taught yes I am self-taught my
63:51 - degree is in Business Administration I
63:54 - specialize in economics ICS and finance
63:57 - uh I did take so I I'll say this in high
64:01 - school I took a course where we learn
64:02 - basic HTML and CSS and that was a long
64:06 - time that was maybe I took the course
64:09 - like 2002 2003 somewhere around there in
64:13 - college I took a C++ programming
64:17 - course I started a course in web
64:20 - development and then I dropped it
64:22 - halfway through and now it's crazy that
64:24 - this is what I do for living but that's
64:26 - it that's the only
64:28 - um formal education that I've had I
64:32 - think there's value in computer science
64:34 - degree and I know that there are big
64:36 - gaps in my understanding of computer
64:38 - science because I've learned on my own
64:41 - uh but in terms of me getting my job
64:43 - done I I I know a lot I know what I need
64:46 - to know uh to to get my job done and my
64:49 - clients are are satisfied
64:51 - I've I've you know thankfully I've never
64:54 - had a client that was not satisfied with
64:57 - their site and let's say didn't want to
64:58 - pay me or got their site redone so I've
65:01 - been you know I've been really lucky uh
65:04 - in that
65:06 - regard uh
65:08 - but I have been self-taught so I've um
65:11 - if if you're interested in knowing kind
65:13 - of my my route that I've taken to teach
65:16 - myself uh comment below comment and ask
65:19 - me below and then I can kind of give you
65:22 - some of the resources that I found most
65:24 - helpful will say this I don't think I've
65:27 - spent more than $30 in the
65:30 - last 10 years on resources for learning
65:33 - how to do web development the best
65:35 - resources I found are
65:37 - free are you some Joey asked if I'm a
65:40 - freelancer I do some freelance work now
65:43 - uh I'm employed full-time at uh
65:46 - Franciscan University as a front-end
65:48 - developer I occasionally do freelance
65:51 - work but it needs to be a project that
65:54 - I'm really interested in
65:56 - because it does take time away from my
65:57 - family I have a wife I have four kids uh
66:01 - so I it has to be either what I'm
66:04 - interested in or let's say they offer to
66:06 - pay me a lot of money and I just can't
66:07 - turn it down otherwise I'd rather spend
66:09 - that time with my kids uh I don't know
66:12 - about all of you
66:14 - but I have a tendency to get kind of
66:16 - really into what I'm doing in coding and
66:19 - if I don't watch myself I can spend all
66:20 - my time doing coding and thinking about
66:23 - coding and it's easy to or your family
66:27 - which in the grand scheme of things is
66:29 - more important especially you my kids
66:31 - are all little I don't want to miss that
66:33 - so the freelancing is kind of taking a
66:36 - back burner
66:41 - now okay someone says to be fair react
66:44 - for WordPress is already
66:46 - Overkill uh I'm not sure exactly what
66:49 - you mean by that so I'm not saying I I
66:51 - disagree with that uh in this case you
66:55 - could check out some my earlier videos
66:56 - where I explain why I'm doing it like
66:58 - this I think
66:59 - it's it's appropriate in this case at
67:02 - least I think so but I'm definitely open
67:04 - to hearing uh alternatives to
67:08 - that someone says ha happy birthday it's
67:11 - it's my wedding anniversary so thanks
67:13 - for that but it's actually my 10year
67:15 - wedding
67:16 - anniversary um someone says thanks for
67:18 - the
67:19 - patience um someone again asked what
67:21 - resources I used please put that in the
67:24 - comments I don't I I want to look up and
67:26 - give you some links so I'm not going to
67:27 - talk about it right now put in the
67:28 - comments and give you a better answer
67:31 - someone says hello
67:33 - Geeks uh okay we have a couple more
67:35 - people saying the same thing what route
67:37 - do you take to teach yourself throw
67:39 - throw it in the comments and I'll give
67:40 - you a much better answer I I'll think it
67:42 - out and type it out with some links for
67:44 - you why did you drop web development uh
67:47 - I'll tell you why I dropped web
67:48 - development I took way too many credits
67:50 - I think I was taking 23 credit hours
67:52 - that semester which um I don't know how
67:56 - credit hours work in universities around
67:58 - the world but at least in the United
67:59 - States a normal full-time schedule is
68:02 - considered it's 12 credit hours so I was
68:06 - almost double what they consider
68:07 - full-time so that was a lot for me also
68:10 - um the teacher of that course had a
68:13 - really heavy accent and I had a hard
68:15 - time understanding him I'm usually
68:17 - pretty good with accents but I just had
68:18 - a hard time and what he was teaching I
68:21 - knew enough about web development at
68:23 - that point to realize what he was
68:24 - teaching was several years out of date
68:27 - and I just I didn't like that so I
68:30 - needed to drop a class anyway because it
68:31 - was too overwhelming so that was on the
68:33 - top of the
68:38 - list someone says they have dreams with
68:40 - me coding I'm the same way I'm
68:43 - definitely same way uh that's that's
68:46 - cool sometimes I actually dream up
68:48 - solutions that really work it doesn't
68:50 - happen all the time but it it does
68:51 - happen so I think it's cool
68:55 - all right
68:57 - someone I'm going to have to cut this
68:59 - off soon because uh I'm getting to the
69:01 - bottom of the live stream and then more
69:03 - you know I get more comments so uh I'm
69:05 - going to say this is the last last set
69:08 - you know whatever's on the screen here
69:09 - at the bottom this is the last set that
69:10 - I'm going to do and I'm going to have to
69:11 - cut it off uh someone says there are
69:14 - support analyst trying to transition out
69:15 - of support into development I have a b
69:17 - completed a bachelor's degree Oracle
69:19 - certified developed an Android app and
69:21 - no Dev experience how do I transition
69:24 - successfully
69:25 - um I would say build some side projects
69:29 - uh learn as much you can build some side
69:31 - projects or get some paid freelance work
69:33 - if you can uh you can also contribute to
69:36 - open source projects on GitHub and
69:38 - that'll build up your portfolio that's
69:40 - really all you need if you have a good
69:42 - portfolio that's what employers want to
69:45 - see the most at least employers that
69:47 - know what they're doing when they hire a
69:48 - developer uh the most important thing is
69:51 - can this person do the job and have they
69:54 - proven it by their previous projects
69:57 - that's what I would work on uh if I were
69:59 - you that's what I look for when when I'm
70:02 - looking at resumés to higher developers
70:04 - the most important thing to me is you
70:06 - know the experience just show me what
70:08 - you've
70:09 - built uh my Twitter somebody asked for
70:12 - my Twitter handle it's in the
70:13 - description of this
70:23 - video okay uh hi how to handle errors in
70:26 - the fetch response uh maybe we can go
70:28 - over that in a later
70:36 - video okay
70:38 - so I'm going to cut that off now because
70:41 - this video has gone super long and it's
70:43 - going to be intimidating for people who
70:45 - are going to want to rewatch it I'll
70:47 - have to make a note that the last half
70:49 - hour or so is all kind of question and
70:51 - answer
70:52 - session but thanks for all the
70:56 - engagement uh I think this is by far
70:58 - like the most active live chat that I've
71:00 - had in the video and I really like that
71:02 - and I like that so many of you have said
71:05 - you know you're you're finding this
