00:00 - Hi, my name is Chris Gagne
00:02 - and I'm an Agile coach.
00:04 - Today, I will talk about The Agile Manifesto.
00:09 - The Agile Manifesto was written in early 2001.
00:13 - A group of 17 very opinionated experts
00:17 - specializing in extreme programming or "XP"
00:20 - scrum, DSDM, and several other frameworks
00:23 - got together for a weekend working session
00:26 - at a beautiful ski Lodge in Utah.
00:28 - While they didn't agree on much,
00:30 - they did come to agreement on this
 powerful Agile Manifesto.
00:35 - It describes the fundamental values upon which the principles and practices of Agile rest
00:42 - if you are effectively delivering software in total harmony with these values and the principles
00:49 - you are agile
00:51 - So what's the manifesto? It's almost poetic. 
Goes like this:
00:57 - We are uncovering better ways of developing software 
by doing it and helping others do it.
01:05 - Through this work, we have come to value
01:09 - individuals and interactions 
over processes and tools
01:13 - working software 
over comprehensive documentation
01:18 - customer collaboration 
over contract negotiation
01:23 - and responding to change 
over following a plan
01:27 - That is while there's value in matters on the right, 
we value the items on the left more.
01:33 - Keep these values and the agile principles in mind 
as you inspect and adapt how your team works together
01:41 - Good luck and have fun!
