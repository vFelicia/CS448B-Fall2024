00:09 - hey guys it's monday morning i just came
00:12 - back from running time from ray shower
00:14 - and awesome week
00:16 - [Music]
00:21 - this is free code cam project
00:24 - it's called sign on game
00:26 - so it's like the traditional simon game
00:28 - where where you get the pattern of the
00:31 - sounds and you have to repeat them after
00:33 - 20 sounds you
00:35 - introduced correctly of course you win
00:39 - [Music]
00:50 - going for a meeting with friends
00:52 - [Music]
01:07 - do
01:17 - [Music]
01:35 - asking for feedback is always worthy
01:44 - [Music]
02:04 - wednesday morning and i've been working
02:06 - on simon game
02:08 - since the beginning of this week
02:11 - this week i did two comments and i
02:13 - started this project
02:15 - at the at the end of the last week
02:17 - introducing the basic ui
02:20 - by the basic ui i mean it's responsive
02:23 - right now however it needs much much
02:26 - more work
02:28 - to be ready to go
02:30 - so far i've implemented
02:33 - the
02:34 - user stories let me show you that
02:37 - i'm presented with random series of
02:40 - button presses
02:42 - this is the random series random ray
02:44 - each time i hit restart there is a new
02:47 - random series each time it starts from
02:49 - step one
02:50 - and
02:52 - if i
02:53 - press the button correctly
02:56 - i
02:57 - have one no sound added
03:00 - to repeat
03:01 - from this array
03:05 - this will continue until 20 steps and
03:08 - after the 20th step
03:10 - the game is over and the user won
03:15 - so the first user story is implemented
03:18 - the next one is each time i input a
03:20 - series um of pattern presses correctly i
03:24 - see the same series of button process
03:25 - with an additional step this is also
03:27 - implemented
03:29 - i hear a sound that corresponds to each
03:31 - button whenever i hit it
03:34 - or the computer hits
03:38 - [Music]
03:41 - okay
03:43 - [Music]
03:47 - so this user story is also implemented
03:50 - the the sounds are heard
03:52 - if i press the wrong button i'm notified
03:54 - i have done so and the series of
03:57 - patterns is repeated
04:00 - let me make mistake so it's four four
04:03 - one one so i will do two two
04:06 - uh one one
04:10 - so here
04:12 - there was oops listen again and the
04:14 - pattern is repeated so
04:16 - the user store is implemented
04:19 - i can see how many steps are in the
04:20 - current series of button presses is
04:22 - exactly here at the top right now
04:29 - if i want to restart i can hit a button
04:31 - to do so and the game will
04:34 - return
04:36 - to a single step
04:39 - yep it works
04:42 - i can play in a street mode where
04:45 - if i make mistake so
04:49 - then it will be restarted so let me play
04:51 - in strict mode so i have to press 4
04:54 - because it was first step without any
04:56 - mistake for two
05:00 - four to four and let's make a mistake so
05:03 - four two
05:04 - one
05:06 - and as you see is notification uh that i
05:09 - made a mistake but i come back directly
05:11 - to the first step and i have to start
05:13 - the game
05:14 - from the top
05:16 - and the last
05:18 - user story
05:20 - i can win the game by getting a series
05:22 - of 20 steps correct i'm notified of my
05:25 - victory then then the game starts over
05:30 - three
05:32 - one
05:35 - one
05:36 - four and the last sound be careful
05:39 - look here what will
05:45 - [Music]
05:50 - happen so i'm not notified
05:54 - and the game starts over from the first
05:56 - step so it's implemented
06:00 - to sum up all of the user stories are
06:02 - implemented and
06:04 - there's the basic ui which is also
06:07 - responsive however it doesn't look well
06:10 - yet
06:13 - [Music]
06:26 - [Music]
06:43 - [Music]
06:46 - i just recorded myself for the silent
06:48 - game i'm going to listen to it right now
06:51 - i deployed the project to the server
06:53 - time for biking
06:56 - [Music]
07:19 - [Music]
07:31 - it's thursday morning and i still
07:33 - haven't done much to improve my design
07:34 - skills it's time for me
07:36 - [Music]
07:42 - i've just answered uh code newbies
07:44 - questions on twitter this week
07:47 - if you are learning to code and haven't
07:48 - heard about them
07:50 - it's really great community so
07:52 - you should check them out
08:07 - okay so it works fine but definitely
08:09 - there's a problem sometimes with the
08:11 - sound so
08:12 - i will have to polish it a bit
08:30 - works fine again problem with the sound
08:33 - and overlapping
08:38 - famous
08:39 - internet explorer
08:44 - who works
08:50 - it's thursday evening and i've been
08:52 - fighting with mobile
08:55 - and sounds and
08:59 - animations on mobile for the whole
09:02 - evening that's it for today
09:04 - that's it
09:05 - and i will come back to it tomorrow
09:07 - maybe i will find a solution
09:10 - mobile animations
09:12 - mobile sounds
09:14 - i
09:14 - hate you
09:16 - it's a friday morning and this is my app
09:19 - after the whole week
09:21 - so
09:23 - so the app
09:24 - is working right now so you can play it
09:26 - it's fully responsive
09:32 - the problem that i have right now is
09:35 - looking for some solution for audio
09:37 - because
09:39 - it's not working properly on mobile
09:40 - devices
09:42 - this is the problem that game developers
09:43 - also have as i've noticed so
09:47 - it may be tough but keep your fingers
09:49 - crossed i hope i'll find some solution
09:51 - and
09:52 - solve this problem
09:56 - [Music]
10:09 - [Music]
10:11 - it's friday evening i finally did it the
10:14 - audio sources change dynamically as a
10:16 - result i can play it on mobile devices
10:17 - which is great
10:19 - because i don't need each time the audio
10:21 - to be triggered by a user because it's
10:23 - still one and the same audio that's it
10:25 - the week is over i introduced all of the
10:28 - user stories from cybergame i tested it
10:32 - and
10:33 - improved its ux and it's live right now
10:36 - the main problem was html5 audio on
10:40 - mobile browsers
10:41 - the plans for the next week i'm going to
10:43 - revise all of my previous projects from
10:46 - freecode.com redesign some of them
10:48 - especially portfolio
10:51 - get to 500 points on brownies
10:54 - in freecodecamp community
10:56 - and
10:57 - play my first front-end certificate it's
10:59 - the end of the first week of vlogging it
11:01 - was really fun and motivating so
11:04 - i will continue doing it it's really
11:06 - great so
