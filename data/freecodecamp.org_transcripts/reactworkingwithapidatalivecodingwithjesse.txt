00:09 - hey everybody is Jessie a little bit
00:12 - later today than I normally am so sorry
00:16 - for everybody who you know won't be able
00:19 - to see this hopefully you can least
00:20 - catch the recording but maybe it might
00:22 - be better for some people because
00:25 - instead of coming in at the end of my
00:27 - normal 2 o'clock train you'll be at the
00:30 - beginning of the stream today that's at
00:32 - 4:30 Eastern Time it's really hot in my
00:37 - office so I do have a fan running let me
00:39 - know if that's making a lot of noise if
00:42 - it's annoying I'll turn it off it's not
00:44 - like unbearably hot so I can stand to
00:48 - turn it off today I'm gonna start out by
00:54 - showing some of the issues that I had
00:56 - yesterday that I was able to fix and
01:00 - I'll show you those had a few like
01:03 - little design changes for the the
01:05 - resource page basically I implemented a
01:09 - lot of what we had talked about
01:10 - yesterday
01:11 - and and then I'm going to show you what
01:15 - I'm doing with the API calls so we're
01:20 - gonna do I'm basically going to be
01:22 - trying to pull in as much of the content
01:24 - as I possibly can from the WordPress API
01:28 - so that the when I'm done with this
01:33 - project they'll be like really no need
01:35 - for anyone to contact me and the people
01:39 - in charge of the content for the site
01:41 - will be able to handle all that content
01:44 - so assuming that nothing like really
01:47 - crazy happens with the site I should be
01:49 - able to just just let it go off on its
01:51 - own which that'll be good I really like
01:56 - working on this I learned a lot of stuff
01:58 - but I am ready to move on it's nice to
02:03 - it's nice to start over with a clean
02:05 - slate and be able to try to do even
02:08 - better than last time
02:10 - all right so I'm just going to check
02:12 - okay great we got our view count is up
02:14 - to a decent amount I always hate to get
02:18 - like right into it before people have
02:19 - had a chance to to join in and I know
02:22 - that this was really late notice I think
02:24 - I I posted on Twitter about it like five
02:29 - minutes maybe four minutes before I was
02:32 - going to stream so they'll probably be
02:37 - some people joining in late because they
02:42 - didn't see it but I'm gonna check the
02:45 - live chat hey hi hey everyone a lot of
02:48 - people saying hi okay so Anthony says
02:53 - there's just a little bit of background
02:55 - noise not that bad
02:57 - okay so cool yeah let me know if it if
03:00 - it does end up being bad so like I'm
03:02 - actually the fan is sitting it's kind of
03:05 - blowing directly on the microphone so I
03:07 - am gonna move it a bit and then that
03:12 - should cut down on the noise and I know
03:14 - uh you know wind can makes really bad
03:19 - noise on a microphone so I don't want
03:20 - the same thing to happen here Anthony
03:23 - says I started front-end course two
03:25 - weeks ago and I finished algorithm today
03:27 - yeah all right way to go that glad to
03:32 - hear that you're you're getting through
03:33 - some of this stuff keep me up-to-date if
03:36 - you can in the live chat I'd love to to
03:38 - hear about more about your progress and
03:45 - that's yeah Sarah said Mike's catch
03:48 - everything yeah it definitely it does so
03:50 - just I'm like turn it off after a little
03:55 - while anyway it actually has done a
03:58 - decent job of getting thing called
04:00 - getting things cooled down a bit so the
04:04 - reason I didn't stream at my normal time
04:06 - listen because I had a meeting the
04:10 - meeting I might have been able to get in
04:13 - like a really really short stream in and
04:15 - still make it to the meeting but I
04:16 - didn't want to try to you know do a
04:19 - really short stream
04:20 - and have it not be kind of like as good
04:24 - as normal I probably would have had time
04:26 - to do any questions or anything so I
04:27 - thought I'd better just a postpone it I
04:29 - plan on working late today anyway
04:31 - so so this this should work out I kind
04:36 - of thought I'd be able to get out of the
04:38 - meeting so that's why I didn't I didn't
04:40 - post earlier about the time change but
04:45 - then like right before maybe like within
04:49 - an hour before the normal extreme time I
04:52 - learned that I I was I had to go to the
04:55 - meeting so that's why I was kind of late
04:59 - notice okay well let me show you
05:09 - Jordan says moving the fan didn't change
05:13 - the sound sounds like you're sitting in
05:15 - a server rooms let me let me turn the
05:20 - fan I can actually turn it down
05:23 - I'll try turning it down a little bit
05:26 - right now and then if I have to I can
05:29 - turn it off completely I also do have
05:32 - another computer on that I don't
05:33 - normally have one so and it's kind of
05:35 - noisy as well I don't know how it turned
05:38 - on I thought I had it off maybe I just
05:40 - had it asleep but I do never like a
05:42 - really old Windows laptop that I keep
05:47 - around just in case I need it so I I
05:50 - almost never need it because I use a
05:52 - browser stack for testing now but before
05:54 - I had that it did come in handy for
05:56 - testing things okay cool
06:02 - so it seems like that sounds better now
06:05 - that the fans turned on all right so let
06:07 - me start showing you a little bit about
06:10 - what's changed since yesterday what's
06:12 - been updated the development site let me
06:17 - put the link I forgot to put the link in
06:19 - the description for the show so let me
06:22 - find the link now and
06:27 - you know I'll post it here we go have a
06:30 - lot of stuff open
06:40 - so here's the link to we now have a
06:45 - development server so normally before I
06:49 - was just doing everything locally which
06:51 - is okay but you weren't able to actually
06:55 - interact with the site near the latest
06:59 - version of the site before it really
07:01 - went live unless you clone the git repo
07:05 - and ran it you know locally on your
07:08 - machine so I had already had another
07:12 - droplet already set up and ready from
07:16 - when we were testing the load balancing
07:17 - and I never I never shut that droplet
07:20 - down so I had always planned on using it
07:22 - as a development server at some point so
07:26 - that is up and running now so you can
07:27 - check out the IP address if if I forget
07:32 - to put it in the the video and you're
07:34 - watching this later on the IP address is
07:36 - 1 6 2 dot 3.2 for 3.8 6.67 oh it's not
07:46 - working again it keeps stopping so it's
07:53 - right now I'm not running it with from
07:56 - from p.m. to
08:02 - and so it's possible that I just need to
08:07 - set that up it's probably not gonna do
08:11 - it right now
08:19 - there you go so
08:28 - I'm gonna start it up again alright it
08:34 - should be working now so I'm gonna try
08:37 - to refresh my page in my other screen
08:39 - okay it is working out I just didn't
08:42 - take the time to set it up in a more
08:44 - reliable way because at first I was only
08:47 - using it just to just to test a few
08:52 - things out but since then I had requests
08:57 - from other people to work here to see
08:58 - the site so now I probably ought to set
09:00 - it up in a better way
09:11 - push-push Pinder asks about is it
09:16 - possible to get the live session on the
09:17 - weekend the recording will be available
09:19 - so you can definitely check out the
09:22 - recording I probably won't do another
09:25 - live session on the weekend but the
09:28 - recording is definitely available so
09:30 - it'll be right here on the free code
09:32 - camp channel there's actually a playlist
09:34 - for all the streams so if you don't see
09:37 - it on like the main page you can check
09:39 - the playlist is just called live coding
09:41 - with Jesse but if you're gonna view it
09:44 - you know sometimes the next day or two
09:45 - it'll probably one of the first videos
09:47 - up on the main page
09:56 - okay
09:59 - all right so let me show you now you can
10:03 - see the site now and actually I don't
10:04 - have it looks like I don't have the the
10:07 - very latest stuff but so I'll bring the
10:10 - latest stuff up on my screen
10:18 - okay see I was wondering where am i when
10:21 - my browser window went so went here I
10:24 - think I have it the site up somewhere
10:29 - else so let's pull it over and now I
10:37 - can't find it
10:42 - oh well not a problem just go to
10:48 - localhost okay so nothing new so yeah
10:56 - nothing new there on the about page
11:03 - figures my dev server needs to be
11:06 - started again I never bothered to figure
11:11 - out why my dev server always needs
11:13 - restarted and only on this computer I
11:17 - can run the same same stuff on my other
11:22 - computers and it works so anyway so on
11:24 - this page it doesn't look like much has
11:26 - changed but all of this data is now
11:28 - being pulled in from the wordpress api
11:32 - so all the text with the exception of I
11:37 - think this title is still hard-coded and
11:39 - the image you can see I need to work on
11:43 - the formatting a bit I think WordPress
11:46 - is automatically wrapping this in a P
11:47 - tag and so it's messing up the
11:49 - formatting so I'll have to I'll have to
11:52 - account for that it'll probably be
11:55 - easier just to account for that in the
11:57 - code then to try to change how WordPress
11:59 - does things because sometimes I do want
12:02 - them to actually use wrap things in P
12:04 - tags but sometimes I don't the only
12:08 - visible change here other than that kind
12:10 - of mistake is I'm actually pulling in
12:15 - the the test pages now the data before I
12:19 - had just made some lists just just to
12:22 - see how it would look now I'm actually
12:24 - pulling this in so when we click it the
12:27 - link works and it goes to our page it's
12:31 - still just test data but hopefully we'll
12:38 - get some real data in there and be able
12:40 - to kind of get a better idea of how it
12:41 - looks and on our resources page this is
12:46 - where we have the biggest change so I
12:48 - switched up from the black which you can
12:52 - see on the dev site right now
12:55 - so I had the black before and I've
12:58 - switched it to the red the red
13:01 - background with it has like this semi
13:04 - transparent background image kind of
13:08 - going across here and then now you know
13:12 - everything's white the check marks end
13:15 - up being like that gold color that's on
13:17 - the site so I'm not sure if I like it
13:22 - being gold what I might end up switching
13:23 - it back to white but for now I think the
13:25 - gold is okay
13:28 - so before some of this stuff was gray
13:31 - but it just doesn't look very good
13:33 - against the red so I did I got some
13:35 - feedback yesterday from you all and I
13:38 - got some feedback from some of the
13:39 - people involved in the project here
13:41 - where I work and general consensus was
13:44 - going with the red would probably be
13:46 - better so with the red and then I
13:47 - increased the padding a bit just to kind
13:49 - of it looked really weird with this
13:51 - background image when it was shorter so
13:56 - that's why I increased the padding a bit
13:59 - but basically everything still functions
14:03 - the same way so everything works I
14:06 - didn't get a chance to check this out on
14:09 - multiple browsers so we did have a an
14:14 - issue open up on github based on what we
14:17 - saw in the stream yesterday and that was
14:21 - that on some browsers especially windows
14:24 - browsers one of them in Windows this
14:27 - this doesn't look right so I'll still
14:32 - have to check that out on some browsers
14:34 - but I didn't want to do it if I was
14:36 - gonna change a lot of the colors anyway
14:38 - I wanted to wait until I changed it
14:40 - before I tried to troubleshoot that so
14:43 - that's something I'll be doing soon or
14:45 - that's something that's that's open for
14:47 - for anybody to you know try out if you'd
14:50 - like to and submit a pull request I did
14:53 - have a pull request that I pulled in
14:55 - from Bill so let me show you I'll be
15:00 - I'll show you and I'll explain to you so
15:02 - since I've only pulled it in on the dev
15:03 - branch I don't think he shows up yet
15:07 - in the official like contributors page
15:09 - but basically bills contributions were
15:13 - pretty nice and that he I didn't have a
15:18 - unique ID a unique key for each of these
15:21 - which you need and reactor it gives you
15:22 - an error message it still loads it but
15:25 - within the console you get an error
15:27 - message in dev tools and then he added
15:30 - this is actually a horizontal rule now
15:32 - before we had a black bottom border now
15:35 - this is an HR and with some shadows and
15:39 - gradients and things going on actually I
15:43 - think this is how do you do is I think
15:45 - this was a background gradient so I only
15:49 - changed what bill sent in just a bit so
15:52 - I just lightened it a bit I checked out
15:55 - the material design documentation on how
15:57 - to do lists and they're lines between
16:01 - the lists are very light so I decided to
16:04 - go with that since we're kind of trying
16:06 - to follow material design principles
16:08 - here and also he put in a little bit of
16:15 - code to make sure that the last in the
16:18 - list the last element in the list
16:21 - doesn't have an HR at the bottom so
16:28 - that's it not not a whole lot happening
16:33 - I didn't get to do quite as much work as
16:37 - I had hopes because I had meetings like
16:42 - kind of unexpected meetings this morning
16:45 - that lasted lasted a while but it was
16:48 - good I guess we'll get feedback for this
16:49 - site so it worked out alright so I'm
16:54 - gonna move this over because I don't
16:56 - really need it right now
16:56 - we'll leave this here so we can keep
16:58 - referring back to it but I want to show
17:02 - you let me uh organize this a bit better
17:09 - here we go but I want to show you the
17:12 - about page and how I pulled in the the
17:16 - data and actually let me check the live
17:22 - chat I had an idea so normally I use a
17:24 - Pomodoro timer so you use this and I
17:28 - thought I should I'm gonna start using
17:30 - this timer now and that way if it goes
17:34 - off it'll be a reminder for me to check
17:36 - the live chat so I don't forget so
17:39 - hopefully I'll check it you know before
17:43 - it goes off but just in case you know at
17:45 - least every 25 minutes I'll check it and
17:47 - then that'll give me just a little
17:49 - reminder of how long these things are
17:51 - taking because I usually forget to
17:53 - record how long things take during my
17:56 - streaming so let me check back in the in
18:05 - the chat here okay not a whole lot going
18:07 - on the chat hey Sebastian how's it going
18:10 - but my employer is now in the live chat
18:12 - Franciscan University Steubenville it's
18:15 - not it's it's actually the the guy that
18:18 - works in the office right next to me he
18:20 - must just be logged into the Franciscan
18:22 - University YouTube account so he told me
18:29 - that my mom was online too but instead
18:34 - of he's just kidding
18:42 - okay so John says thin light thin border
18:45 - lines are easiest by using one pixel
18:48 - inset and a very light gray okay cool I
18:55 - might try that I am I kind of just went
18:57 - with what what bill had for this and
19:00 - just lightened it a bit but if I get a
19:03 - chance maybe I'll try to you know change
19:05 - it even more I wouldn't mind it being a
19:08 - bit thinner I mean I think this I think
19:11 - this looks fine to me but but a little
19:16 - bit thinner probably would match more
19:18 - with what's in the material design
19:20 - documentation so so thanks for that I'm
19:23 - like I'm kind of getting down to the
19:25 - wire here so I'm only gonna work on
19:27 - things that are absolutely necessary but
19:30 - I can see like I'm I'm a little bit
19:34 - confident now that I can get done what I
19:35 - need to get done before the 20th and
19:40 - then I'll switch to another project but
19:42 - it seems like I'm gonna be able to get
19:43 - things done I say that knowing that I
19:48 - usually run into unforeseen issues that
19:53 - take longer so assuming that I don't run
19:57 - into too many of those should get
19:59 - everything done then I won't have to
20:01 - work crazy hours all right so I'm gonna
20:07 - show you what I gonna show you all the
20:09 - about page I have the music I'm playing
20:15 - in my headphones is from Spotify
20:17 - throwbackthursday playlist and this week
20:19 - it's on 90s music and so if you grew up
20:22 - in the 90s like I did it will be
20:26 - nostalgic for you
20:27 - I find myself remembering like lots of
20:29 - stuff that happened in middle school in
20:32 - grade school that I associate with these
20:37 - songs alright so
20:43 - at the top here before so as of
20:46 - yesterday I wasn't pulling any data in
20:50 - for this page it was all coded directly
20:54 - into this component now I'm gonna pull
20:58 - in more data so the big problem that
21:00 - I've been wrestling with and I've
21:02 - mentioned it a few times on the in the
21:07 - live stream is that I needed a way to
21:09 - get multiple data from multiple
21:13 - different post types in one API call so
21:17 - I needed it to be here because I wanted
21:19 - anything in here gets rendered on the
21:22 - server so the API call will actually get
21:26 - made on the server and everything will
21:28 - get rendered and then the data will get
21:31 - sent to the client as an HTML page and
21:36 - then it can also be made when you do
21:39 - client-side routing so the same call
21:42 - could be made on the client the problem
21:44 - was when I tried to write some code to
21:47 - do multiple calls inside here
21:49 - I always got errors it's possible that
21:52 - there's a way to do it and I just I just
21:54 - couldn't figure it out
21:56 - so I found another way there's a plugin
21:59 - for the WordPress for WordPress that
22:03 - exposes this endpoint this multiple post
22:06 - type endpoint and then you can say what
22:10 - types of posts you want so right now I
22:12 - want the PDF page post type and then I
22:15 - want just the page post type I didn't
22:19 - want to do this because you can't if you
22:22 - specify parameters for you know for how
22:25 - you want to narrow this data down the
22:28 - parameters apply to every post type so
22:30 - it's not that useful because certain
22:34 - post types have different they have
22:36 - different data that's coming through and
22:39 - I have different needs to the post type
22:40 - so what I'm gonna have to do to make
22:42 - this work is this is fine but I'm now
22:44 - going to end up getting more data
22:46 - I would normally need and it should work
22:50 - for most pages the only pages where it's
22:52 - going to be a little bit tough is if I
22:55 - happen to have a page that has a lot of
22:56 - different data I might not get it all
22:59 - with this hundred per page thing and
23:02 - that's that's the WordPress limit you
23:04 - can't easily get more than 100 posts per
23:06 - page and I don't have time to try to
23:07 - work around that so probably what will
23:10 - end up happening is everything that's
23:12 - essential that I really want to be
23:14 - rendered on the server will be in this
23:15 - first API call and then if there's other
23:17 - things that should be rendered later on
23:20 - they can be rendered later on I'll
23:22 - render it in another API call so usually
23:25 - it'll be based on a user interaction and
23:26 - that's fine so then upon that
23:28 - interaction it'll make the call and and
23:30 - that should be fine it should work if
23:32 - for some reason there's a page where
23:34 - there's some data that just needs to
23:36 - display and there's no user interaction
23:38 - I can make it happen on a scroll so
23:41 - perhaps if a user gets like halfway down
23:43 - the page then I'll make the call and
23:45 - load the stuff at the bottom of the page
23:47 - it should work out none of the pages
23:49 - right now are so big that it won't work
23:52 - but today I'm actually gonna do some of
23:55 - this I'm kind of showing you how I did
23:56 - it first and then I'm gonna do it on
23:59 - some pages so we'll find out if it'll
24:03 - work for all the pages but since I did
24:05 - that the API call I get back has all the
24:11 - PDF pages and all the page post types
24:15 - and so down here I started doing things
24:19 - like for the intersection I made a page
24:23 - in WordPress called about intro so I'm
24:27 - grabbing the the page that has about
24:32 - interest I'm using filter and then I'm
24:36 - I'm rendering the content of that page
24:40 - inside this this column div so I've had
24:44 - to move the float X class up here to the
24:46 - column instead of having it on the P tag
24:48 - which is fine because I don't want the
24:52 - person entering things in WordPress to
24:53 - have to worry about any code so why
24:55 - don't you just be able to use the the
24:57 - WYSIWYG in WordPress which will
24:59 - automatically add
25:00 - eat eggs but it won't automatically add
25:01 - the classes we want one thing I didn't
25:04 - know about is I use the map here just
25:06 - because I was copy and pasting some
25:07 - stuff I was doing elsewhere there's only
25:10 - one post that I really want so I'm not
25:11 - sure if I have to use map so if there's
25:14 - a better way to do this where I can just
25:16 - grab this right from filter and use it
25:18 - let me know if anybody knows it if not
25:22 - I'm I'm not really gonna take the time
25:24 - to look it up right now because this
25:25 - works and this is okay because if I ever
25:29 - have to grab more than one post type and
25:32 - render it it's already set up to be able
25:34 - to handle that but for now this is the
25:38 - sodus you see I've done that for each
25:40 - section so let me show you let's go back
25:43 - to the about page just to see so each
25:45 - section is now its own page in WordPress
25:48 - and I can show you what it looks like in
25:51 - WordPress as well so in WordPress if we
25:58 - go to pages see I have about intro
26:02 - that's the top part the about quote
26:05 - banner is down here section 2 section 3
26:13 - so that's what I'm gonna do the only
26:15 - things that aren't on there right now
26:18 - these I didn't put in they're not
26:21 - editable in these for now I don't think
26:24 - I'm going to put them in because the
26:26 - odds of these changing are really small
26:31 - so there's not really high turn over
26:35 - here at the university especially for
26:37 - the upper level positions you know once
26:39 - people get up there they stay there
26:40 - forever until they're ready to retire
26:44 - also I'm not sure that these will change
26:47 - soon enough so if I have time later on
26:50 - maybe I'll do this but for now I think
26:52 - it's okay to keep these hard-coded
26:54 - because for these I would have to
26:57 - probably have to make custom post types
26:59 - so it's a little bit more work than just
27:01 - an extra page so I want to make a custom
27:04 - post type for this you know kind of bio
27:06 - card and then iterate over that
27:09 - render it and then the same thing here
27:13 - it would be a custom post type for these
27:15 - collaborator cards so I don't want to do
27:17 - all that for those sections right now
27:19 - since they're not likely to change but I
27:24 - want to check out we'll start with the
27:26 - home page and we'll just check out my
27:31 - service topic this is driving me crazy
27:36 - if I had only just took like you know 15
27:40 - minutes a month ago to fix this when it
27:43 - first happened I wouldn't have to worry
27:45 - about this and I still I still never
27:49 - take the time all right so on the home
27:55 - page I'm gonna leave all this up here
27:59 - hard-coded this is not likely to change
28:01 - and I really don't want it to change
28:03 - because all of the spacing and
28:05 - everything on all the screen sizes is
28:08 - pretty exact if someone went in here and
28:11 - changed this and made it a lot bigger or
28:13 - something it it would mess everything up
28:15 - so don't want that to change
28:19 - the video for now I'm gonna leave it
28:23 - like this at some point it might not be
28:24 - a bad idea to have a page with a custom
28:28 - field that was just the embed code for
28:31 - this video to be able to change it but
28:35 - for now I think it's it's okay like that
28:37 - I want to make these their own custom
28:40 - post type so we'll definitely be pulling
28:44 - in we're gonna make the post type for
28:46 - this and then pull in the data the the
28:51 - image for this is gonna change but I
28:57 - don't think I'm gonna take the time to
28:59 - put it in here if I'm gonna make this
29:01 - editable from WordPress then we'll see
29:05 - maybe the person in charge of the
29:07 - content will do that the person in
29:11 - charge of the content and her name is
29:12 - Amy
29:13 - I always just keep saying the person in
29:15 - charge of the content but it's much
29:17 - shorter to just say Amy so Amy is gonna
29:19 - put
29:20 - probably put the the new image in I can
29:24 - show you the image though this is it's
29:26 - going to be this image so which will
29:30 - work well because then the the title
29:32 - will go down here and this section will
29:33 - be darkened a bit so it's perfect image
29:35 - too to put the title there it won't
29:37 - really block anything this section which
29:43 - I've already made a page for this
29:46 - section will be editable I'm glad Google
29:51 - Calendar let me know that today is
29:52 - garbage day or tomorrow is garbage day
29:55 - so I need to put the garbage out today
29:56 - so glad for that reminder and then these
30:01 - will be pulled in from the API as well
30:05 - so we're gonna have three three
30:09 - different sections so we're going to
30:13 - need three different post types this
30:14 - will be a from the page post type this
30:17 - will be from I guess we'll call this the
30:20 - formation cards yeah I'm not sure what
30:25 - else to call them right now but the
30:27 - formation card post type and this will
30:30 - come from the the news or the blog
30:33 - actually we won't need to make a new
30:35 - post type because I'm gonna pull these
30:37 - from there just the normal posts that
30:40 - are built in to WordPress so that should
30:43 - be okay as is and if I have time I may
30:50 - change how these look but I think
30:53 - they're okay right now I just don't like
30:57 - that I've like kind of made them all
30:59 - have a max height and there's all this
31:02 - space but I'm not sure I'll have time to
31:06 - really do what I need to to make them
31:08 - look how I want them to look all right
31:11 - so let's go in and work on this I'll
31:16 - connect this up first and these because
31:19 - I already have the post types made and
31:21 - then I'll decide whether or not I
31:23 - actually want to make a new post type
31:25 - during the stream or not let me know in
31:27 - the live chat if you'd like to see me
31:28 - create a post site but I've already done
31:30 - it a few times so you may not even want
31:33 - to see
31:33 - again it doesn't take very long but may
31:40 - not be very interesting all right
31:44 - oops not moose no is there some setting
31:51 - that I can edit so that the my Mac
32:00 - doesn't automatically change the order
32:02 - of my my desktops like that's for some
32:07 - reason it always does that and I don't
32:08 - like it I have them in the order that I
32:10 - want them in alright so we need to find
32:15 - our home pages are the index page and
32:22 - make it slightly bigger check this so
32:30 - I'm gonna grab the about page and move
32:35 - it over I have so much going on here
32:37 - let me get rid of some of these things
32:44 - serious like such changes no I don't
32:47 - think I changed it no okay so oh you
32:56 - know what I had I just occurred to me I
32:58 - had one other error that kept happening
33:00 - at the end and I didn't show you how I
33:02 - fixed that error so the error was that
33:06 - every time I tried to go to one of those
33:07 - single pages that the PDF pages that we
33:13 - were linking to from the about page I
33:15 - would get an error about the side nav
33:17 - init function and I figured out what the
33:20 - problem was the problem was that in the
33:27 - layouts so in in the layout components I
33:35 - didn't have these two dots here so it
33:39 - was just going to static jazz app
33:41 - touches which was fine normally it was
33:45 - working normally
33:46 - for some reason when it was coming from
33:50 - one of those pages that we were using
33:53 - the parameterised routing for it just
33:57 - wasn't working so the reason it I didn't
34:02 - catch it before was because the the one
34:04 - page that I was looking off of that did
34:06 - work was he wasn't using the layout it
34:09 - was using the old style of how we did
34:11 - this so anyway that's all I had to fix
34:13 - and it fixed everything so it took a
34:15 - while to figure it out but it was an
34:18 - easy fix once once I did all right so
34:24 - now I'm going to take the about page and
34:25 - move it over here so that we can copy
34:28 - and paste some stuff if we need to and I
34:32 - do want to copy and paste this it's not
34:37 - really fun to type out so we want to hit
34:44 - that end point that multiple post type
34:46 - end point that we get from the plug-in
34:50 - and we're gonna need we don't need PDF
34:55 - page when you post
34:59 - I think post is the post type we'll see
35:03 - in a second we either get the data we
35:05 - want and then we want page we haven't
35:07 - made that other post type yet so I'm not
35:09 - I'm going to try to get it because we'll
35:10 - get an error and I can check this right
35:15 - away to see if it worked by going into
35:17 - dev tools for the site and we can go
35:23 - into the react dev tools screen and
35:26 - we'll see our props up here oops we're
35:33 - getting an empty objects I did something
35:35 - wrong so let me maybe I need to say
35:38 - posts which I it again
35:46 - hmm
35:50 - still not get anything all right so I'm
35:58 - gonna just grab this and we'll try it
36:01 - out right in the browser
36:14 - hmm not getting anything
36:20 - okay we should have gotten something on
36:22 - that first time
36:33 - oops I grabbed the wrong site it ought
36:36 - to it auto-filled this other site which
36:39 - I also built in a similar way okay so
36:46 - this is better so this is giving us what
36:48 - we need
36:49 - I'm not sure why it didn't work the
36:50 - first time I did it let's try it again
36:56 - and I'm gonna manually refresh this it's
37:04 - possible it was just a refresh problem
37:07 - there we go and now we have everything
37:11 - safe - props and we can filter things by
37:18 - its type if we need to or filter by
37:23 - anything we want but for the news part
37:27 - we're gonna filter by post and then
37:32 - we're gonna filter secondarily by we
37:38 - have a custom field where's our custom
37:42 - field ID so why our type inside this
37:47 - advanced custom field okay I'm gonna
37:52 - check the lights out again it's been a
37:53 - while this timer actually is really
37:56 - helping me to remember how long it's
37:58 - been
38:09 - d 404 says just arrived welcome also
38:16 - after you use the fetch API to get your
38:19 - data I do I do tests or I do use the
38:24 - fetch API so I recommend using it if you
38:27 - haven't tried it yet definitely try it
38:29 - out it's way easier than any other
38:31 - method I've ever used to make API calls
38:33 - and don't worry about the browser
38:40 - support just use the polyfill so as long
38:46 - as you use the polyfill you should be
38:48 - fine on most modern browsers it even
38:52 - works on it works on Internet Explorer
38:54 - 11 so definitely it's definitely worth
39:00 - learning it'll save you time it's just
39:04 - so much more simple I really like it a
39:07 - lot better then do the other ways of
39:11 - making API calls with you know Ajax or
39:14 - you know just like a plain xhr request
39:19 - Sebastian asks what do you need tested
39:21 - on edge ok the yeah the drop down the
39:29 - the select input on the resources page
39:33 - was acting weird if you check out the
39:36 - the github repo there's an issue open
39:41 - for that
39:50 - okay so Sarah Sarah tested her on
39:53 - Firefox and it looks fine on Firefox
39:54 - that's awesome but it looks like she
39:57 - said Opera and Chrome on on windows are
40:05 - not it's like waiting out everything so
40:08 - I have to test that out
40:19 - okay yeah if you want to see it in
40:22 - action I did put a link in so maybe for
40:27 - everyone that's come in a little bit
40:30 - later on I'll put the link in the live
40:32 - chat again for the dev server hopefully
40:35 - it's working and it didn't quit working
40:38 - again okay it's still working so should
40:44 - be able to go there
40:48 - okay blad says just landed here why does
40:51 - jessie have a timer running it's a
40:54 - Pomodoro timer which I usually run this
40:56 - all the time when I'm working and I
40:58 - record how long it takes me to do
41:01 - everything I record that in my Trello
41:04 - board so you can check out my Trello
41:06 - board I just not realised I have my
41:08 - calendar up here so I've been showing
41:09 - everyone everything I'm doing all month
41:11 - so I hope there's nothing embarrassing
41:12 - up there
41:13 - and it's not as my wife's calendar on
41:15 - there too so I really don't have a good
41:18 - idea of what's on there because she
41:20 - could have put anything in there so
41:21 - maybe I'll have to move that to another
41:24 - screen for future streams or just get
41:28 - rid of it maybe that's better I'll just
41:30 - headaches it out of anyway so like these
41:36 - numbers that are on my Trello board and
41:38 - there's a link to my Trello board in the
41:39 - description if you want to check it out
41:41 - these are like the dark numbers or how
41:44 - many plummeted or cycles I estimate that
41:46 - a task will take and then the greyed out
41:48 - ones or the the slightly transparent
41:53 - ones are how long it actually has taken
41:57 - me so this is really helpful for me to
42:01 - be able to like I can go back in and see
42:03 - how long things took me before it's
42:05 - helpful for being able to accurately
42:06 - estimate future projects how much time
42:09 - it will take me and it is helpful as
42:13 - well for me to remember just to take a
42:15 - break because otherwise I would just
42:17 - keep working and working and lose track
42:19 - of time so for every time I get through
42:23 - a 25-minute session I take a five minute
42:25 - break after four sessions I take a ten
42:28 - minute break which is the long gray
42:29 - and during that time I can check my
42:32 - email I check Twitter you know get up
42:35 - and walk around so often times that'll
42:40 - be a nice break for me to just evaluate
42:42 - like is what I'm doing right now the
42:44 - most important thing I could be doing
42:46 - should I switch to something else like
42:47 - just gives my brain a break and I
42:50 - noticed when I don't do that I can they
42:53 - get stuck on one problem for hours and
42:55 - hours and not get anywhere and sometimes
43:00 - I shouldn't worried about that problem I
43:02 - should have just let it go and moved on
43:04 - but since I never really stopped to
43:06 - think about it I don't make that
43:08 - decision so this is a really nice way of
43:10 - doing things and I know I've seen
43:19 - actually a lot of people use this and
43:21 - there's even a one of the free code camp
43:23 - challenges is to make your own Pomodoro
43:26 - clock I haven't gotten to that challenge
43:28 - yet so I am still working through my
43:31 - free code camp front-end certification
43:36 - it's actually I'm gonna do here's what
43:40 - I'm gonna do I'm gonna do my short break
43:41 - and then I know if this time is up then
43:44 - I should probably get back to coding
43:45 - again our likeness this I'm gonna try to
43:49 - remember this from now on we're gonna do
43:50 - Pomodoro sessions and we're gonna try to
43:54 - stick to during the session we code and
43:56 - then during the break we talk and that
44:03 - might be a more that'll be a nicer flow
44:07 - for things and then it'll let you all
44:10 - know like what's coming yeah I like that
44:14 - idea let me know if you think about that
44:16 - I think it should it should work but has
44:23 - anybody made the Pomodoro timer and the
44:27 - free code camp thing right now I'm
44:29 - working on my well I should say I
44:33 - finished working on my weather my
44:35 - weather thing my weather app but I
44:37 - didn't I didn't move on like I didn't
44:40 - end in a link to
44:41 - anything because I was gonna style it
44:44 - but functionally it can it works it
44:46 - works fine I just haven't done any
44:47 - anything to style it yet and I built it
44:51 - in reacts all right so I'm gonna check
44:58 - out
45:06 - okay so it looks like Sebastian also is
45:09 - verifying that chrome and edge or white
45:12 - for that talking about this this
45:18 - drop-down is it's all white and you
45:22 - can't see anything on chrome and edge
45:24 - for for Windows so I have to work on
45:28 - that
45:29 - oh yes Patrick you're my hero today
45:35 - alright so a few minutes ago I had asked
45:38 - about these desktops being rearranged
45:46 - automatically and I don't want that to
45:48 - happen so Patrick just sent me
45:51 - instructions on how to do this so I'll
45:55 - do it on this screen so in case you've
45:57 - ever had a similar problem we have
45:59 - System Preferences and Mission Control
46:04 - and uncheck oh wow that's really obvious
46:09 - so I even asked that everybody I should
46:12 - have just I should have just checked so
46:18 - we'll uncheck that and then that will
46:20 - fix the problem
46:23 - awesome I'm actually I was like a
46:28 - Windows user for my entire life until I
46:30 - got this job and I've been working here
46:34 - for almost two years so I've only been a
46:37 - Mac user for about two years less than
46:40 - two years so still don't really know
46:43 - enough and and actually I come way
46:47 - behind because Windows 10 like I haven't
46:49 - really used Windows 10 that much so I
46:52 - don't know what's going on there so I
46:54 - feel like I'm not really an expert in
46:56 - any operating system like if you like
47:00 - put me in front of a Windows XP computer
47:03 - then I would be fine I can do anything
47:06 - you want me to do but right now I am NOT
47:09 - not an expert at any operating system
47:13 - oh cool
47:16 - so Patrick actually like look that up
47:19 - and figured it out because that annoyed
47:22 - him as well so awesome Thank You Patrick
47:24 - thanks for taking the time to do that
47:28 - okay Vlad says it's a really interesting
47:31 - way to keep track and make sure you're
47:32 - working smart I may steal the process
47:34 - from you yeah feel free to steal it for
47:36 - me I took it from somebody else
47:38 - so I definitely did not invent this I
47:41 - did a course on Pluralsight because I
47:44 - got a free like three months
47:46 - subscription to Flora site and there was
47:49 - a course on using agile methodologies
47:52 - for one
47:53 - so usually agile was used for teams well
47:56 - I pretty much work just myself on all my
47:59 - projects so I thought it sounded really
48:03 - cool and I took the course and part of
48:06 - the course was talking about the
48:07 - Pomodoro timer and so that's where I
48:11 - picked that up from and I thought I'd
48:13 - give it a trial and use it for a few
48:14 - weeks and see how I liked it and that
48:17 - was last year and I've liked it so much
48:19 - I've continued to use it for for all my
48:23 - my projects occasionally I'll do a
48:26 - little side project where I won't use it
48:28 - but sometimes even on side projects I I
48:32 - still use it because it's still a good
48:34 - idea to you know break up the work like
48:36 - that
48:43 - okay Sara says she's on the jQuery part
48:47 - now for free code camp so cool yeah that
48:51 - would be cool if you all are doing the
48:52 - free code camp stuff too it would be fun
48:54 - to know what what part you all are on so
48:57 - if you're in the live chat right now and
48:59 - you can type go ahead and type if you
49:02 - feel like sharing of like about where
49:05 - you're at and if you're watching this
49:08 - later on you put it in the comments
49:11 - that'd be really cool just to get an
49:13 - idea of where we're all at if if if you
49:16 - are doing the free code camp challenges
49:19 - I had a question about the Trello Adams
49:23 - so actually so my my time here for my
49:27 - short break is up so I'm just gonna
49:28 - answer this last question and then get
49:30 - back to the code the question was about
49:33 - the Trello add-ons that I'm using with
49:35 - the Pomodoro Technique
49:36 - so yeah that's a great question let me I
49:39 - believe that this is actually a Chrome
49:43 - extension so let me see let's assume my
49:49 - extensions are okay so here are my
49:56 - extensions I'm gonna make this
49:57 - bigger yeah okay so where's that
50:07 - there we go so the extension is called
50:10 - scrum for Trello so I think that's it I
50:17 - think on a previous livestream I may
50:20 - have said that it was a Trello add-on
50:24 - but I think I was mistaken so I
50:27 - apologize if anybody tried to add this
50:29 - in Trello and couldn't find the add-on
50:31 - but then later on I I realized that it
50:35 - was an extension and I had meant to
50:39 - mention it in a stream after that and
50:41 - then I forgot until now so so that's
50:44 - really cool while I'm in here my
50:46 - extensions I'll show you this is a
50:48 - really useful extension this tells me
50:52 - like how what websites are built on so
50:54 - I'm constantly using this when I see a
50:56 - website that I like or one that's really
50:59 - terrible and I just want to see like
51:00 - what what do they build this with yeah
51:04 - this is Michael tampermonkey is the one
51:06 - that you need to make the colors on
51:09 - github change so react dev tools is how
51:14 - I get the react stuff in the in from
51:18 - developer tools and something what else
51:23 - all the JSON format err definitely
51:26 - recommend that if you want to check out
51:27 - JSON data that's why when I look at the
51:30 - data from the WordPress API it looks
51:32 - nice and not all jumbled and I think
51:36 - that's it for like developer stuff
51:38 - browsers that local I've actually never
51:40 - used this I download this and I never
51:42 - used it at all so I can't really say
51:44 - whether it's good or not and then
51:47 - retired j/s is kind of cool you can see
51:49 - if there's any vulnerable JavaScript
51:51 - libraries being used on any of your
51:53 - sites it's not bad but I found like 99%
51:56 - of the time it just shows like some
51:58 - version of jQuery as being vulnerable
52:02 - which which is ok but it's not like that
52:08 - useful because if everybody is using
52:11 - this same vulnerable version like I
52:13 - don't I don't know like there's got to
52:15 - be some version of jQuery that's not
52:17 - vulnerable but it seems like everybody
52:19 - that's using jQuery
52:20 - it shows up as vulnerable so anyway
52:24 - hopefully that was a little bit helpful
52:28 - can't believe I never thought of showing
52:30 - that before because I use those really
52:32 - often so you can see this is that
52:36 - analyzer here it's telling me that
52:38 - Trello was built with jQuery they're
52:41 - using Quantcast for analytics and Google
52:43 - tag manager and Google Analytics so this
52:46 - is actually this is crazy
52:48 - I wouldn't guest:i if I were to guess
52:50 - that I thought Trello was built with
52:52 - some sort of like JavaScript framework
52:54 - but it's it's actually just all jQuery
52:57 - crazy I've been surprised to see how
53:01 - many sites are built with react now that
53:04 - I didn't realize her built with react so
53:06 - which one was I was on GoDaddy recently
53:09 - and GoDaddy site is now built with react
53:12 - that was a little surprising Wow okay so
53:17 - the song you guys remember the song
53:20 - Mmmbop from the 90s from by a Hansen
53:23 - that just came on I'm definitely gonna
53:24 - skip that it's nostalgic but not not
53:31 - really the song I want to listen to
53:40 - okay so let me get back to the code now
53:43 - I did ask a question and I'm getting
53:46 - answers in the live chat I'll read them
53:47 - off really quick it's not really polite
53:52 - to ask a question and then ignore the
53:54 - answers oh cool so Patrick has done the
54:00 - Pomodoro thing and actually put a link
54:02 - to it in the live chat so I'm gonna
54:08 - check it out and while that's loading
54:17 - yeah
54:19 - that's nachiket says join the camp only
54:23 - a day ago and have reached only till
54:25 - bootstrap also well you got a good start
54:29 - good start keep doing keep going and
54:32 - keep us updated on how it goes inside
54:36 - the matrix is on the twitch API projects
54:38 - about halfway done with it also gave
54:44 - your Pomodoro a heart Patrick all right
54:47 - cool it oh okay so here's Patrick's
54:49 - Pomodoro nice
54:58 - I like that okay
55:06 - oh so it automatically takes you into
55:08 - the break interesting that's cool we can
55:11 - double click to reset that's really cool
55:17 - I'm gonna check out the code to this
55:19 - later on that's awesome yeah thanks for
55:22 - uh thanks for sharing that link
55:32 - hey Andrew so Andrew joining us welcome
55:40 - glad you can make it inside the matrix
55:45 - says I've been listening in 90s rock
55:46 - such alternative on Pandora lately so
55:49 - many middle-school memories yeah we must
55:52 - be a brown the same age because that's I
55:54 - was in grade school in Middle School in
55:56 - the 90s as well so it's always it's
56:00 - always fun to listen to the old music
56:03 - and then just have all these memories
56:05 - come up
56:22 - Manny says it would be cool to link the
56:24 - timer to the Trello board and have it
56:27 - forcefully limit how much time you can
56:29 - spend on each feature I think it would
56:31 - increase productivity man he also says
56:35 - 90s for the best hey Manny I'm not I'm
56:40 - not sure if I've seen you post in the
56:42 - live chat before so I may be mistaken
56:45 - but if this is your first time posting
56:47 - then welcome and thanks for contributing
56:51 - here in the live chat yeah Manny that's
56:55 - like a really really good idea I'm not
56:58 - sure how I would accomplish that but I
57:00 - think that would be a really cool side
57:03 - project
57:14 - okay jonbi says hi hi again hey how's it
57:17 - going glad you could make it alright so
57:22 - let me go back I spent a lot more time
57:25 - so that the Pomodoro timer only really
57:29 - is effective if you if you pay attention
57:32 - to it and actually stop working or start
57:36 - working when you're supposed to that's a
57:39 - top tip for me you have to be
57:44 - disciplined about it alright so now
57:46 - we're back on our homepage we're getting
57:48 - the data that we need so now all we have
57:50 - to do is render that data in the right
57:54 - places so okay I was thinking that
58:00 - where's all their stuff that I forgot
58:03 - it's down the bottom because this is the
58:05 - alternate version of the homepage that
58:07 - will end up being the new version all
58:15 - right so this is where we're gonna put
58:18 - our the data from our quote so I need to
58:25 - figure out what the what the slug is for
58:28 - that so let me do that you find the slug
58:40 - pretty sure it as the word quote in it
58:54 - maybe it doesn't I have to bring up the
58:59 - the actual WordPress and bring it over
59:03 - let's see oh I didn't even call it quote
59:06 - I called it home black banner instead of
59:09 - quote banner so I guess that works
59:13 - yeah that it works because we're not
59:14 - we're not actually using a quote in
59:16 - there before it used to be a quote and
59:18 - now it's the mission statement so this
59:20 - yeah this actually does describe what it
59:22 - is
59:24 - so I'm assuming that that's the yeah
59:27 - that's the we need okay so we're
59:31 - gonna grab and we'll need to change this
59:35 - as well because we're not this is the
59:36 - the old information that was there okay
59:45 - so I know I was going to copy copy this
59:53 - to make it easier
59:59 - I should copy I have a similar section
60:02 - on the about page so I will copy the
60:04 - section that most closely matches it I
60:13 - think it's up
60:17 - up here
60:21 - here it is
60:24 - so I'm a copy and paste but then I'll go
60:27 - through what it does mmm this is
60:39 - actually a little bit different because
60:40 - we have this h3 but it is inside the
60:46 - block how are you gonna do this
61:00 - okay I think maybe we can do this so I'm
61:04 - gonna change it up a little bit so this
61:07 - is still gonna be we're still gonna have
61:10 - this blockquote like we do here but I
61:14 - want to have
61:24 - well actually is that why they're
61:26 - automatically make it a div I think I
61:28 - figured out why it wasn't formatting
61:29 - properly I didn't realize that it
61:34 - happened so that's cool I might have
61:40 - fixed this just by this and I won't have
61:43 - to worry about it again so let's check
61:45 - this out rearrange this
61:48 - [Music]
62:00 - because this will be good if this works
62:01 - now then that'll save me a bit of time
62:18 - anybody remember Lauryn Hill from the
62:21 - 90s just just had Lauryn Hill come along
62:24 - Spotify if you'd like to follow along
62:28 - with my playlist as well check out the
62:31 - throwback Thursday playlist on Spotify
62:33 - nice alright so that was the issue with
62:36 - the formatting so awesome so I
62:42 - inadvertently figured that out as always
62:47 - this is fun alright so let's I still
62:58 - need to do it alter this just a bit well
63:01 - I mean I need to make this home and
63:08 - [Music]
63:10 - inside of the block quote we're gonna
63:15 - have an h3 and the h3
63:29 - is going to have the title wait no it
63:36 - won't because we have a title already
63:47 - we already have it site or the title is
63:49 - the home black banner okay so we can't
63:51 - do it like that
63:53 - but since WordPress already has a way to
63:58 - make things like an H tag without having
64:00 - to deal with the code then I'm okay with
64:02 - leaving it like that so I think we can
64:04 - safely just bring in everything
64:06 - including that that H tag and it should
64:10 - be pretty obvious to whoever is is
64:13 - updating it that it should work so I'm
64:17 - gonna copy this paste it in here and
64:24 - make sure see that's an h3 so it's
64:27 - already you know it's easy and WordPress
64:30 - to make that in h3 and let's check out
64:35 - the code really quickly so h3 I didn't
64:41 - realize when I copied it over it grabbed
64:43 - that I don't want that to stay that
64:45 - could cause problems
64:46 - I may have to double check and make sure
64:49 - that it didn't do it with other things
64:50 - as well okay so we'll update that so we
64:56 - can get there the correct data in there
64:59 - and then now we'll get rid of this block
65:03 - load
65:10 - and oops we need to make sure we close
65:13 - that I'm not worried about the
65:16 - formatting says we'll have once we once
65:23 - we commit this it will auto format it
65:24 - for us but it looks like something is
65:34 - making there we go
65:35 - the highlighting was just weird but I
65:37 - think that all right everything should
65:40 - work now so save that let's make sure
65:45 - okay so it's not bringing in everything
65:49 - let's check it out
66:00 - what happened did we not the update this
66:08 - maybe it was just it was probably
66:10 - keeping the that's really weird
66:22 - that was the old data right maybe it's
66:28 - just caching the old data
66:39 - let's see
66:48 - yeah for some reason that data is
66:51 - getting you still cashed maybe refresh
67:02 - maybe I need to log into WordPress again
67:13 - it looks like
67:22 - no I mean it looks fun that's all I'm
67:27 - not gonna worry about it I mean the data
67:30 - will update eventually usually it
67:37 - updates pretty quickly but anyway we'll
67:43 - check back in a few minutes the next
67:48 - thing is we can pull in some stuff from
67:50 - here and we may need to maybe to see I
68:00 - don't know if I'll need to copy and
68:05 - paste these myself or maybe Amy who
68:09 - handles the content can do this I think
68:12 - they'll probably be some additional
68:14 - things and so we'll see I'm gonna worry
68:18 - about it now but I do want to do the
68:19 - code to be able to pull these in so that
68:22 - they're not hard-coded
68:31 - okay cool um I was thinking I'd have to
68:35 - make a new component but it looks like I
68:37 - already made one so glad about that
68:47 - now I just check the live chat inside
68:49 - the matrix says the Fugees yes the the
68:51 - Fugees that's what I meant so I had I
68:53 - was listening to Lauryn Hill song but it
68:56 - probably was a Fuji song it's just
68:59 - Lauryn Hill does most of the singing
69:03 - let's see
69:22 - I just saw a couple of things in the
69:24 - live chat right now so I'm gonna check
69:26 - it really quick I'm gonna read it out
69:28 - really quick I can see if a few of you
69:34 - remember the Lauren Hill and Fuji song
69:37 - so yeah definitely good songs Jordan
69:40 - asked would it would I miss today we
69:44 - haven't really got that much done today
69:45 - we just kind of went over some of the
69:47 - fixes that I did for some things that
69:49 - were going wrong yesterday and we're
69:52 - just kind of gradually going through and
69:54 - taking a lot of this content that has
69:58 - kind of been hard-coded in and we're
70:00 - instead pulling it from the WordPress
70:02 - API because I would like as much of the
70:06 - site as possible to be editable in
70:09 - WordPress yes Ellie thanks for thanks
70:21 - for asking about the code editor it is
70:24 - Adam so I love it when people ask me
70:28 - about the editor the the theme is the
70:32 - steady theme SCT I also Ellie I don't
70:37 - think that I've seen you in the chat
70:39 - before so welcome sorry if this is not
70:42 - your first time and I just don't
70:44 - remember but welcome to the live chat
70:48 - Manny says sorry I'm late to the party
70:50 - here but did you scrape some content
70:52 - into the JSON I noticed that the quote
70:55 - had tags on the JSON object and I
70:58 - haven't seen that before
71:03 - yeah
71:04 - [Music]
71:08 - let me see
71:15 - let me make sure I know exactly what
71:17 - you're referring to let's see and I'm
71:24 - pretty sure you're referring about the
71:26 - JSON that we saw here and let's find it
71:33 - so are you talking about like the HTML
71:37 - tags that are showing up here in if that
71:41 - case if that is true then yeah we are
71:44 - we're getting this content out of
71:45 - WordPress the wordpress api and for the
71:50 - content fields you actually do get all
71:54 - the HTML that's included in those fields
71:57 - as well and it comes through with the
71:59 - json that's why we had to set it with
72:01 - dangerously set enter HTML because up
72:08 - here so that the tags actually rendered
72:11 - as HTML tags instead of just being
72:14 - printed out on the screen
72:15 - because we wouldn't want to see we
72:19 - wouldn't want to see those tags
72:20 - displayed on the screen we want them to
72:22 - be actually evaluated you know by the
72:25 - browser
72:35 - well Jeremy has got an interview
72:37 - tomorrow
72:38 - so it says thanks for the advice awesome
72:41 - really really happy for you so you'll
72:44 - have to let us know how the interview
72:45 - goes hope maybe if the interview is
72:51 - early enough tomorrow would you be able
72:53 - to let us know in tomorrow afternoon's
72:56 - livestream that would be really cool
72:58 - otherwise they can wait till next week
73:00 - but I'm excited so I want to know how it
73:03 - goes haha jonbi says one of these days
73:10 - you should just switch to a different
73:11 - editor just to mess with us actually I
73:13 - love so jahnvi I have an uncle who
73:19 - everybody calls him John be even like
73:22 - his kids call him call him John B or
73:24 - Johnny B sometimes so I I think every
73:27 - time I I see that name and say it there
73:29 - I always think of him
73:41 - all right so let's get back to this and
73:46 - we have a lot done already since we
73:48 - already have these cards made so all we
73:53 - need to do is put some data in there and
73:59 - we'll need C in this case we do we are
74:06 - gonna iterate over the column as well or
74:10 - we want to keep printing the column so
74:11 - we'll go at this point and let's see for
74:21 - a second I thought about doing a similar
74:23 - thing to what we had done on the
74:25 - resources page where you know we have
74:28 - all these different tabs and we're doing
74:30 - some pretty fancy stuff that I think it
74:32 - was fabian had submitted a pull request
74:35 - and did some cool stuff with the tabs
74:37 - and how that gets rendered out but since
74:44 - it's such a small amount of data I think
74:46 - we're fine just to actually render out
74:49 - the things for the for the tabs just
74:54 - right off the bat for both tabs so I
74:56 - think that should work and I don't think
75:01 - it warrants trying to pull in the code
75:04 - from the resources page and replicate
75:07 - what's going on there so for this one
75:11 - we're just going to just do really
75:12 - simply this for our data and we want to
75:19 - filter so everything needs to be
75:21 - filtered since we're pulling in these
75:23 - this big chunk of data that has multiple
75:25 - post types
75:26 - so the first filter we need to put on it
75:28 - is going to filter for the post type so
75:33 - we're gonna do post post type and we
75:40 - want the type that equals post
75:45 - and loose equals post and then after
75:52 - that we're going to do filter it further
75:55 - and we want the post that's gonna have
76:01 - the post a CF type of what is this one
76:11 - announcement and let me check let me
76:16 - check to make sure that that's the value
76:18 - we want yep announcement okay great and
76:25 - the other one is I think news right so
76:30 - our tights for getting announcement in
76:31 - news great
76:32 - okay so announcement and then after
76:41 - we've done that then we can map and go
76:45 - through everything so we're gonna post
76:49 - and for we're gonna grab all of this
77:01 - and on here we're gonna add a key and
77:07 - the key is gonna be our post ID whoops
77:15 - to put that in brackets if you're not
77:19 - familiar with react anything that you
77:22 - put in brackets inside your JSX which is
77:24 - basically this HTML looking stuff here
77:27 - that ends up it's JavaScript it's
77:30 - evaluated as JavaScript so that's why
77:34 - we're pulling in data and putting it in
77:36 - brackets like this okay so our title is
77:40 - going to be post oops
77:53 - title and our content
78:04 - our content is going to be post content
78:13 - rendered and actually I need to put
78:17 - render it up here too
78:18 - and the the reason these all have to be
78:22 - worded like this this is this is just
78:25 - how it comes out from the WordPress API
78:28 - and then for the URL it's going to be I
78:35 - think it's just I'm gonna double check
78:42 - that though all right so let's see
78:52 - oh we call it link
78:57 - now we didn't that's not it that would
79:01 - be the link for WordPress we don't want
79:07 - that link we want I hope we made a field
79:11 - for this because we need it otherwise
79:12 - you're gonna have to make one now
79:28 - mmm well that's no good I'm gonna
79:33 - double-check
79:46 - let's check out what it looks like in in
79:54 - WordPress so we have news if I see a
79:58 - description slug and we didn't put in
80:03 - anything for URL so let's make that post
80:07 - right now we'll make that that field no
80:14 - wait a second I remember why we didn't
80:18 - do it now okay because we want these to
80:24 - link to the actual blog post page
80:29 - originally some of them were gonna link
80:31 - to external resources but I don't think
80:35 - we want to do that now we want to we
80:37 - want this to work just like a regular
80:38 - blog so it's gonna link to a blog page
80:40 - alright so forget everything that I was
80:43 - just saying I've lost my mind for a
80:44 - second okay
80:47 - so wish that we're good so the URL then
80:50 - becomes
80:58 - let's see do we want to put this
81:08 - we don't really need the URL we need the
81:10 - slug let me check out the I want to
81:16 - check out this component just to see how
81:18 - what we're doing with that inside the
81:21 - component
81:32 - okay
81:36 - all right so then what we're gonna do is
81:38 - build the URL here and pass the complete
81:43 - URL in there because inside of here
81:45 - you know we're checking for a blank URL
81:48 - we're checking if so we're actually not
81:54 - gonna lame
82:06 - this is probably gonna be unnecessarily
82:09 - Vitt in here just for now just in case
82:11 - but it'll probably unnecessary to check
82:13 - for a blank link because the way we're
82:15 - gonna do it there's never gonna be a
82:16 - blank link but it's okay well no sense
82:24 - in like refactoring in the middle of
82:25 - this if I'm not a hundred percent sure
82:27 - that I'm not gonna use that so for this
82:32 - URL I want to make it I'm gonna use a
82:39 - template literal and I'm gonna say slash
82:43 - news and then so I can go back into
82:49 - JavaScript inside my template literal we
82:52 - need to put a dollar sign and then curly
82:55 - brackets and so now we can put
82:57 - JavaScript in and then I'm gonna say
82:59 - post slug and that's gonna put together
83:07 - that that URL will work because we're
83:13 - using parameterised routing for anything
83:15 - that's on the route of news so it'll
83:21 - just pass the slug along to our template
83:24 - for news which is our single news page
83:27 - template and then it'll use that here it
83:32 - will pass it along as ID so this is
83:35 - really the slug it will use the slug
83:36 - here to make the API call to get just
83:38 - the data that it needs for that
83:41 - particular post so we're good
83:44 - alright so we should be able to save
83:47 - that and I can delete the rest of these
83:53 - and I got a Hootie and the Blowfish is
84:01 - playing right now I totally forgot about
84:04 - them I used to really like Hootie and
84:07 - the Blowfish when I was in grade school
84:11 - we can also copy this now and with only
84:15 - one change use it down here
84:20 - and all what i have to change is this
84:24 - filter and then we can get rid of this
84:32 - and let's save it and refresh restart my
84:41 - search
84:46 - it's getting worse it used to be that I
84:48 - could code for a while without having to
84:50 - restart my dev server and now it's like
84:52 - very frequently oh man my timer ran out
84:55 - I didn't even notice it all right well I
84:57 - guess I'll start the showed up again
84:59 - with the break let's go down here
85:01 - whoa I'll shoot I had thought about that
85:04 - and then I forgot so this I'm actually
85:08 - kind of glad this has happened so this
85:09 - is what happens if you don't dangerous
85:12 - yet enter HTML when you're grabbing
85:13 - stuff from WordPress content the tags
85:17 - actually show up so you can see them
85:20 - there and you can see here the tags are
85:23 - showing up the good thing is what we did
85:25 - worked and it is in fact filtering
85:28 - things into the right spot and also good
85:33 - news is we know exactly how to fix this
85:35 - so let's do that now so we need to go
85:37 - into our text card before since we were
85:41 - manually typing in a string of what we
85:45 - wanted these to be I had never bothered
85:48 - with setting the inner HTML and probably
85:52 - lazily because I always knew this was
85:54 - eventually gonna be populated with other
85:55 - data so I should have just done it
85:57 - before but now we can just grab I'll
86:03 - just grab this I don't even have to type
86:04 - it out again
86:05 - so for the title and the description we
86:10 - want to do this for both of them so I'm
86:12 - gonna put this on the title and on the
86:14 - description and we're gonna change this
86:21 - to this drops title and we're gonna
86:29 - change
86:31 - this one - this crops do we call it
86:38 - content
86:39 - I just want to double-check yes we did
86:41 - call it content here this props content
86:46 - okay now we can remove this okay we can
86:51 - remove this and let's save it just to
86:55 - make sure it works
86:56 - whoa
87:03 - all right this is I forgot that okay so
87:09 - here's what's happening here in this
87:12 - post I went to pages sorry
87:19 - in this post there's an image I had done
87:24 - this earlier when I was meeting with
87:26 - with Amy who does the content just to
87:28 - show her how to put an image in and I've
87:30 - forgotten about it but what we want to
87:32 - do is we actually don't want that image
87:34 - to show up so here's what I think I
87:38 - think we only want the excerpt to show
87:40 - up here we don't want the full text
87:42 - because it could be really big like this
87:46 - already extends out so let's let's
87:48 - change this so what we want to do we
87:51 - only have to change it here post excerpt
88:01 - and now let's check out
88:09 - wait a second let me check the check
88:15 - this
88:19 - I didn't think the excerpt kept images
88:23 - Oh actually no I don't think I want to
88:28 - keep the excerpt because it adds in this
88:30 - more this more link I don't want that
88:33 - and I know I can change this and the
88:35 - function is a PHP file but I don't want
88:38 - to go through all that so all right I'm
88:47 - gonna go since I had already used up
88:48 - most of my five minutes that I was gonna
88:50 - spend on a live chat I'm gonna go to
88:52 - lunch at now that will give us a minute
88:54 - to think about the best way to address
88:55 - this basically the problem is I don't
88:59 - have enough space here here to put
89:03 - everything so I need a way to just get
89:05 - some of the data also I need to strip
89:08 - out any images because I don't want
89:10 - images in here
89:10 - the simplest way seemed to be to get the
89:13 - excerpt from WordPress instead of the
89:16 - entire content but that's not gonna work
89:18 - because of the more tag so potentially I
89:21 - could use that and then just strip out
89:23 - the more tag either on this end with
89:27 - JavaScript or on the wordpress end with
89:29 - PHP so I'm gonna go back to the live
89:33 - chat and talk for a little bit with you
89:36 - all when we can all think about what the
89:38 - best way to do that is
89:52 - okay I did get a Sarah asked if I'd
89:55 - tried Visual Studio code yeah I have
89:58 - tried Visual Studio code I was using it
90:03 - actually used it on some of my earliest
90:05 - live streams so the ones I did on my own
90:07 - channel before I got invited to stream
90:10 - for free code camp I was using visual
90:13 - studio code on some of those so if you
90:15 - actually want to see me using Visual
90:16 - Studio code go check out some of my my
90:19 - first live streams the I will warn you
90:24 - though the first couple of streams are a
90:26 - little bit rough because the quality I
90:29 - didn't I didn't really have the hang of
90:32 - using OBS yet to do my streaming so the
90:36 - quality is not great and there were some
90:39 - streams where I had no one watching so
90:41 - it's just me talking no interaction with
90:43 - anyone but you will get to see me use
90:47 - Visual Studio code so I think the
90:49 - project I'll be working on after I
90:51 - switched from this one which will be
90:53 - like at the end of next week I think I'm
90:56 - gonna switch back to the project that
90:57 - was working on so I'll probably be
90:59 - switching back to Visual Studio code the
91:01 - reason I use Visual Studio code for that
91:03 - project is because a lot of it is
91:05 - written in c-sharp and when I tried to
91:08 - load c-sharp and Adam it didn't
91:10 - automatically highlight things for me
91:11 - but when I loaded it in Visual Studio
91:13 - code it did highlight things really
91:15 - nicely so instead of getting the right
91:18 - plug-in for Adam I just used Visual
91:20 - Studio code because that was that was
91:22 - faster and I had been looking for an
91:25 - excuse to try it out anyway and so it
91:29 - was good I I liked it I'm not ready to
91:32 - switch from Adam but I do like it
91:44 - a new path says hi hey how's it going
91:48 - Ali says hi Sabir says hi hey everyone
91:51 - thanks for joining in wow this would
91:54 - already it's already 6 o'clock Wow hey I
91:59 - just checked my phone so a man at 6
92:01 - o'clock I wonder for my wife's tried to
92:03 - call me she did not try to call me but
92:06 - she did ask me in the text do you know
92:09 - what happened to the sweet Italian
92:11 - sausages and no I don't know what
92:14 - happened to them I hope the dog didn't
92:16 - eat them we recently got a dog against
92:24 - my against my will
92:27 - we got a dog and basically I didn't want
92:34 - a dog because there are a lot of work
92:35 - and I knew that I would probably be
92:38 - doing a lot of the work and I knew that
92:40 - I would fall in love with the dog and
92:43 - there was a good chance that we wouldn't
92:45 - be able to keep the dog because the last
92:46 - time my wife wanted a dog it didn't get
92:50 - along with the kids and so we had to get
92:51 - rid of it it broke my heart so I didn't
92:53 - want my heart broken again but she
92:55 - brought on this dog and the dog loves me
92:57 - sorry for the little tangent but there
92:59 - was no questions in the live chat so I
93:01 - thought I'd just say it so the dog loves
93:04 - me and wants to be around me all the
93:06 - time and the dog hated my wife which was
93:12 - kind of funny because she's the one that
93:14 - really wanted a dog so the dog I mean
93:17 - literally that that if the dog was
93:19 - eating and my wife walked into the room
93:22 - the dog would leave the room wait for my
93:24 - wife to leave and then come back in and
93:26 - resume eating so I did feel bad for my
93:30 - wife because she really wanted that dog
93:31 - so the dog in my wife now get along but
93:34 - now my wife thinks that she's allergic
93:36 - to the dog so I think we're gonna end up
93:40 - getting rid of the dog I feel really bad
93:43 - for the dog because it just changed
93:45 - homes to us and now it's gonna change
93:47 - again and so anyway and then I'm gonna
93:50 - miss the dog so anyway the whole reason
93:56 - I even get onto that is
93:58 - the dog's been eating food off the table
94:00 - so if one of the kids has like a
94:01 - hamburger or something and leaves it on
94:03 - the table and goes in the other room
94:04 - when they come back in the room the
94:07 - hamburger is missing and the plate is
94:09 - clean it's because the dog eats eats all
94:13 - their stuff so now I'm gonna check the
94:19 - live chat really quick and then I'll get
94:20 - back to to what we were doing we'll
94:22 - figure out a solution to our little
94:24 - problem as youngbae said yeah blame it
94:29 - on the dog Jesse it's true I didn't he I
94:31 - only ate one sausage I didn't eat all of
94:34 - them
94:42 - Wow Sebastian scissors after midnight
94:46 - where you were you from Sebastian you
94:49 - probably told me before and I just don't
94:50 - remember
94:57 - alright okay I did have some other
94:59 - questions come in the live chat while I
95:00 - was telling a story about my dog
95:03 - so Jambi yes how long did it take you to
95:05 - learn react and basically anything I
95:12 - really didn't pay that much attention to
95:15 - react until last May so I went to a
95:19 - conference last May and everybody was
95:21 - talking about react and so that's what I
95:23 - really like seriously started thinking
95:25 - like that I need to learn about react
95:26 - because it looks cool I had like I had
95:30 - heard of react before then but my
95:32 - attitude was kind of like oh man another
95:34 - JavaScript framework like well we'll see
95:36 - we'll see if this one is sticks around
95:40 - you know because there's so many
95:41 - frameworks right so basically it's been
95:46 - about a year I haven't I didn't really
95:50 - try to build anything in react until
95:55 - probably like January or May so it
96:03 - wasn't until this year that I actually
96:05 - tried to build something in react I had
96:08 - done some tutorials in react before so I
96:10 - had watched some video tutorials I did
96:12 - the Khan Academy a tutorial for react
96:15 - but I hadn't really successfully built
96:18 - anything until until this this year so
96:24 - sometime in in the early months of 2017
96:29 - I started like seriously starting to
96:33 - build things and learn more about react
96:35 - so I the first react site that I ever
96:37 - launched like for a client I launched it
96:41 - on April 1st of 2017 so that was my
96:46 - first successful site and so it hasn't
96:51 - really been that long it's kind of
96:54 - surprising now that I think about it
96:56 - that I've I'm building site so when I
97:01 - say like that I really had consider
97:03 - myself to be very new and still learning
97:05 - react like really it hasn't
97:07 - that long so I'm definitely not an
97:10 - expert at it
97:12 - Oh Jeremy's got a see you later Jeremy
97:15 - Jeremy says it's got to go
97:18 - thanks for the videos I'll let you know
97:20 - how my interview goes tomorrow if I
97:21 - catch it all right awesome
97:22 - yeah definitely want to hear about the
97:24 - interview good luck with that and yeah
97:27 - and thanks thanks for watching
97:29 - let me check I'm going to take a few
97:32 - more questions
97:34 - well Sebastian said you can add an
97:36 - excerpt field in WordPress so whoever
97:38 - adds the post can add a little excerpt
97:40 - with no image and then use the real post
97:43 - for the blog post yeah I can oh I'm
97:48 - gonna think about that I got to think
97:50 - I'm not sure if I want I can see pros
97:57 - and cons to that so definitely it would
98:00 - be cool for the content editors to be
98:05 - able to say exactly what they won on the
98:07 - front but it would also be a little bit
98:11 - of extra work I guess they could just
98:15 - copy and paste like the first paragraph
98:18 - if they really wanted to
98:22 - so we'll see maybe maybe although that
98:24 - is I kind of like that I do you know and
98:26 - I think about it more that might be the
98:28 - best solution here
98:37 - sir-sir guala says it's five where I'm
98:40 - located cool does that mean like 5:00
98:42 - a.m. or 5:00 p.m. if it's 5 p.m. then
98:49 - you're probably pretty close to my
98:50 - timezone if it's 5 a.m. then you you're
98:55 - probably on the other side of the world
98:56 - I encourage says it's 3:30 5:00 a.m.
99:02 - here in India okay cool yeah I mean I
99:04 - usually remember what time it is in
99:06 - India because I've had who is it Rohan
99:10 - always tells me what time it is in India
99:12 - so Rohan must have been asleep for this
99:15 - one usually he stays up to like 2:00
99:17 - a.m. India time and I don't know how he
99:24 - does it and on couch how are you up at
99:27 - 3:35 a.m. watching this I'm glad I'm
99:31 - glad you're watching this thanks for
99:34 - watching but that's crazy all right
99:42 - Sebastian has a cat sitting on his lap
99:47 - right at the moment it's really hot in
99:49 - the house and the hairy cat is not
99:51 - helping yeah is it you know like pets
99:54 - pets and kids always want to like be
99:57 - right next to you when it's hot and like
100:00 - my son my oldest son Raphael like when I
100:04 - go to put him to sleep at night like
100:06 - he'll cuddle up next to me and we'll
100:08 - read a book or something and he'll say
100:11 - like oh I'm so hot and I'm like dude
100:13 - just like you're you're like on top of
100:15 - me you know you can't just scoot over a
100:18 - little bit it's not that I don't you
100:19 - know I don't want to cuddle with him but
100:22 - it's like doesn't help if the body heat
100:25 - is being shared okay Sebastian you're
100:29 - Spain all right awesome
100:39 - oh it's about Sebastian Asif if I saw
100:43 - what he said about what I asked yeah uh
100:45 - obviously I saw that now so I think that
100:49 - is a good idea and I'm probably gonna go
100:51 - with that dyad asks what do you think
100:55 - about the UJS I haven't used UJ s and I
100:59 - haven't learned enough about it to have
101:01 - a good opinion on it so I'm not gonna
101:03 - try to give you an answer that I would
101:05 - just make up what I will say is that
101:08 - I've seen a lot of people talk about it
101:11 - on Twitter so I mean it seems legit just
101:15 - from like the amount of buzz this
101:17 - getting and amount of hype on Twitter
101:19 - and the people that are like legitimate
101:21 - programmers who are using it and saying
101:24 - it's good so I can't say firsthand
101:26 - anything about it but it does seem like
101:28 - it's a legitimate alternative framework
101:37 - Andrew said I started at work to make an
101:40 - admin dashboard and react and react
101:42 - router and fell in love with it that's
101:45 - awesome
101:46 - I'd like to see that I don't know if
101:48 - you're able to share that share a coder
101:51 - there any anything with that or a link
101:53 - but that would be really cool to see
101:54 - Andrew John B says I gotta head out
101:57 - myself to hope you all have a good day
101:59 - have a good day Jesse and see you again
102:00 - sometime soon
102:01 - all right see you John B probably
102:04 - already left so I didn't read that fast
102:05 - enough but in case you're still here see
102:07 - you thanks for joining and contributing
102:11 - in a live chat really appreciate that on
102:15 - couche says I just came in what's the
102:17 - problem we were having okay so here's
102:19 - the problem he came in so basically you
102:20 - can see on the screen it's pulling in
102:24 - I'm pulling in some data but it's
102:29 - pulling in like an image and stuff and I
102:31 - don't want that I basically just want a
102:33 - little bit of text like the first bit of
102:34 - text so I think the solution we're gonna
102:36 - do is I'm gonna make another field for
102:39 - this post
102:40 - so I'll have another field probably up
102:43 - here down here somewhere
102:44 - that's just going to be for the the
102:47 - excerpt right so the content editor is
102:50 - going to type in just a little bit and
102:52 - that's
102:52 - here here and then the real content will
102:55 - appear after you click it will take you
102:57 - to another page and show it all Alberto
103:03 - says without giving it too much thought
103:04 - add a style for the card image to
103:07 - display none yeah actually that's a
103:10 - really good idea that would that would
103:11 - solve the image thing it still wouldn't
103:14 - solve the problem of trying to pool like
103:16 - all the the content but that's a really
103:22 - good idea for like a simple fix okay let
103:32 - me get back to this now that we've we've
103:34 - kind of decided on a solution let's do
103:38 - this I'm gonna make I know that there's
103:39 - an excerpt field that you can add that's
103:42 - like kind of by default comes in
103:44 - WordPress but I'm not going to use that
103:45 - one because I don't know I don't think
103:49 - that'll automatically strip out the tags
103:51 - and I want all the tags stripped out for
103:54 - this part because I don't want people
103:56 - putting like an unordered list or
103:58 - something crazy in here that's gonna
103:59 - throw off my formatting so I'm gonna use
104:02 - the custom fields plug-in to make a
104:05 - field I already have the posts field and
104:11 - I'm just gonna add excerpt and the other
104:18 - cool thing I can do with this is that I
104:19 - can put explanatory text so let me make
104:23 - this a text area and I can also limit
104:26 - the characters so let me think how many
104:29 - characters would probably fit there
104:31 - there's anybody good with estimating
104:33 - characters so I wanted to fill up I mean
104:36 - it can go all the way down to here but I
104:38 - don't want it any any more so I wonder
104:40 - if I have all right
104:51 - this is about 30 characters across okay
104:59 - so 300 I'm gonna set a three hundred
105:01 - character limit because it's about 30
105:03 - characters across and I'm pretty sure I
105:05 - could get at least ten lines on here so
105:07 - 30 or 300 character limit
105:11 - and for the formatting I'm gonna say no
105:17 - formatting so it's not gonna pull in any
105:19 - of the HTML tags for the instructions
105:23 - I'm gonna say
105:34 - give a little bit of instruction and
105:37 - it's just going to be required yes this
105:40 - will be required we need this otherwise
105:42 - we'll get nothing on here and that
105:44 - that'll be no good so not all the posts
105:47 - will appear here I'm just gonna grab the
105:49 - newest post so I won't actually need
105:53 - this for all of them but at some point
105:54 - probably every post will appear here
105:56 - unless unless like more than four posts
106:00 - get added all at the same time all right
106:04 - I'm gonna double check make sure I
106:06 - filled everything in and all right that
106:10 - looks good so let's update and I'm gonna
106:15 - go back to posts and I'm just gonna fill
106:18 - in some of this data so we have
106:19 - something excerpt and I'm gonna grab
106:23 - some lorem ipsum text or maybe I use
106:30 - bacon if some yesterday of the day
106:32 - before
106:34 - what's your favorite lorem ipsum
106:36 - generator I know I've seen a generator
106:40 - for samuel l.jackson it's just like
106:44 - Samuel Epson we could try to use that
106:48 - there's like a
106:54 - there's a generator that uses all like
107:00 - the bad language versions of it and then
107:02 - I think there's another one that just
107:03 - has the quotes that that don't have bad
107:10 - language in it so I think we'll use the
107:13 - stuff without the bad language
107:29 - I
107:37 - I gotta read the quotes first since I'm
107:40 - not you know this is a site for the
107:41 - University I sure don't put it anything
107:43 - crazy up here but this is a quote I
107:45 - think from the movie unbreakable I
107:50 - believe so
107:55 - this will this should work I do want to
107:58 - test out
108:00 - okay so cool so this did work so we have
108:03 - we stopped at 300 characters so that
108:08 - would definitely work out to give us an
108:10 - idea of how much the 300 characters are
108:12 - so let me update this and I need to
108:18 - update our code because we're grabbing
108:23 - the excerpts from the ACF field now and
108:28 - we might end up getting an error I'm
108:32 - just going to try but we'll probably end
108:33 - up getting an error because this field
108:35 - is not going to exist for the some of
108:37 - the posts right now we save not actually
108:45 - safe I just need to restart the dev
108:48 - server
109:06 - hmm
109:12 - well
109:16 - actually this is odd we're still if you
109:18 - notice like this is still the old data
109:21 - and nothing is nothing is updating I
109:31 - don't like that that's really weird
109:40 - wow this is so I haven't blocked this
109:43 - off so that it doesn't display anything
109:45 - this is what the site would look like
109:47 - it's not too bad but it's still showing
109:53 - okay now that is the right data that is
109:56 - still showing why is it not pulling in
110:00 - what we just did right content imposed a
110:03 - CFX oh yeah what's going on
110:31 - that's weird
110:43 - oops I was looking for content I meant
110:45 - excerpt
110:53 - here we go
110:55 - ACF excerpts all right so it's here we
111:01 - see it here
111:15 - okay so what's going on here
111:36 - yeah I'm thinking maybe it is the cash
111:39 - so Sebastian just said cash but the
111:42 - other thing is like I'm not there
111:46 - shouldn't be any cash when I'm running
111:48 - the dev server so I have it set so that
111:53 - the the cash is like one second or
111:56 - something so that shouldn't be the issue
111:57 - and then I haven't set up a cash for the
112:03 - WordPress API and obviously like we're
112:06 - getting the new data in the API as well
112:22 - actually I want to add a new post to
112:36 - okay
112:46 - so you check that out so we got this so
112:49 - it's not an API caching thing but
112:53 - potentially like I guess it could be
112:56 - trying to pull in most ACS excellent
113:04 - are we caching
113:16 - you check my server Dutch AS VAL to make
113:20 - sure i'm not cashing anyone so yeah so
113:26 - it should be yeah so the cache time it
113:34 - looks like I've set it to 100
113:36 - milliseconds
114:00 - yeah so that that looks like it's set up
114:02 - fine
114:11 - okay so let's open up getting some
114:14 - requests to open up dev tools let's see
114:19 - I think I have it automatically set to
114:22 - disable the cache if dev tools are open
114:31 - so let's see if that fixed it just from
114:36 - being open no but it did freeze my desk
114:42 - for her again
114:45 - alright so we'll start that up again
114:46 - with dev tools open
114:56 - this is one of those unexpected
114:57 - slowdowns that I was worried about let
115:05 - me make sure that I have the cash
115:10 - disabled
115:22 - I can't remember where that what that is
115:31 - anybody remember where that option is in
115:34 - dev tools
115:43 - should I read through all the ones make
115:45 - sure I'm not missing it
116:01 - maybe it's somewhere else let me check
116:03 - oh that's in the network tab okay sorry
116:07 - I wasn't looking over there yeah okay
116:12 - cool I did have disabled cash checks I
116:15 - thought I always did keep that off
116:31 - it's such a huge here's what's weird to
116:35 - me so we've definitely now I know what
116:39 - happened man if you haven't already
116:43 - figured it out oh I feel so silly now
116:49 - okay so we only changed it here right
116:54 - our this is behaving exactly as we told
116:59 - it to behave because it's still being
117:01 - told to pull the content rendered for
117:05 - the announcements oh man
117:10 - see this there we go that's what we need
117:20 - all right that's it and that's pretty
117:24 - much perfect as far as the length goes
117:31 - we could increase it a bit
117:39 - so I can maybe go like three owner we
117:44 - could probably fit another line in there
117:45 - I don't want it to look too crowded at
117:47 - the bottom so maybe I can go like two
117:50 - 320 characters who ever really wanted to
118:02 - but I don't think that's a big deal
118:04 - we'll see if that's really something
118:07 - that's necessary I can increase it a bit
118:09 - okay so so this works and actually the
118:14 - cool thing is I wasn't getting errors I
118:16 - was I was thinking I may get an error
118:18 - because that field wouldn't exist at all
118:20 - in ACF but it seems like we're not
118:24 - getting the error at least it's not
118:30 - causing it man these things are coming
118:34 - from looks like we're not giving
118:43 - something in it a key somewhere so we
118:49 - need to figure out what's not getting
118:50 - the key and they say Oh since you won 34
118:53 - in the blockquote that's weird because
118:57 - we're we're only pulling one thing maybe
119:00 - it still wants a key even though it's
119:02 - one thing so we give that a key these
119:04 - are caused by the YouTube embed so the
119:12 - YouTube embed seems to be working so I
119:14 - guess I'm not gonna worry about these is
119:16 - there any special thing that needs to
119:19 - happen with YouTube embeds and react
119:20 - that's gonna mess up the site if so you
119:24 - know about it
119:25 - please let me know otherwise I'll just
119:28 - kind of let it go and make sure that I
119:33 - test out that homepage on different
119:36 - browsers so let's put in the key and
119:42 - wish do like we've been doing and say
119:45 - post id loose post id
119:55 - and we can check to make sure I guess I
120:02 - didn't refresh
120:08 - great okay so we don't have that error
120:11 - anymore oh so let's I'm just going to go
120:16 - ahead so we've been working on this for
120:18 - a while and how long were you doing this
120:20 - I have at least done probably four
120:28 - Pomodoro sessions so far I've been
120:31 - streaming for what like two hours I want
120:35 - to say at least three or four I'm gonna
120:37 - say I've done three more sessions so I'm
120:40 - gonna bump that up to six because I have
120:43 - done some a little bit of talking so
120:45 - three sessions I'm glad that I estimated
120:49 - it at 13 because I'll probably need most
120:53 - of that time although we as we run into
120:57 - and figure out you know some of these
121:00 - issues it'll make each successive page a
121:03 - bit easier but anyway a home page just
121:07 - looking at looking decent now so this is
121:10 - everything that we wanted to do for the
121:11 - home page well with the exception of
121:13 - this what the heck is going on with this
121:19 - let's double check let's check this
121:22 - again for some reason
121:35 - oh you know what why is this a quote
121:42 - let's change this so I think I put
121:52 - I think I took out the normal editor and
121:54 - I put in this custom field here and
121:56 - that's probably what's messing things up
121:58 - because the original data probably had
122:02 - this in it and nothing else
122:09 - yeah so that's what's go into our custom
122:12 - fields and yep home barriner fields and
122:19 - we had the quote in alright so let's
122:22 - let's just get rid of that because I
122:24 - don't think we need yeah we don't need
122:30 - that this should work without it better
122:35 - to just simplify it if we don't need it
122:38 - now let's go back to the pages we'll see
122:41 - what's going on
122:42 - and if I'm correct yep there we go so
122:47 - once again it's doing exactly what we
122:51 - told it to do I was just confused about
122:53 - what I was telling it to do so let me
122:56 - grab
123:03 - what I have it I still have the
123:06 - development server open which does have
123:09 - the text that I want so I'll grab it
123:11 - from there here and then let's make sure
123:21 - yeah I want to get rid of that data JSX
123:25 - cuz that'll mess things up and update
123:31 - now we'll be able to see what it really
123:33 - looks like and if it's it's gonna look
123:40 - how we want it to look
123:51 - man this dev server is like stopping so
123:54 - often it might be faster to just not
123:56 - have hot module reloading and manually
123:58 - refresh the page alright cool so this is
124:02 - working this is how we wanted it to look
124:06 - awesome
124:12 - so that's the home page done and I
124:17 - forgot to start up my my timer again
124:21 - no let's I'm gonna commit this
124:32 - check out the status okay so we've
124:35 - edited what do we do the about I don't
124:39 - remember what we did to the about page
124:41 - it's probably just some sort of Auto
124:43 - formatting thing that that happened so
124:50 - I'm not gonna worry about it Oh
125:01 - [Music]
125:27 - enough to remember to push all these
125:29 - changes to the the dev server so you all
125:34 - can see this I'll try to remember to do
125:36 - that before I leave today okay so we've
125:44 - got the home page getting the data that
125:47 - we want from the API I'm gonna check the
125:49 - live chat and then I'm have to decide
125:53 - whether I want to keep working or go
125:56 - home since it's after 6:30 p.m. my time
126:03 - so it's definitely beyond the point at
126:06 - which I normally go home I've been here
126:08 - since 9:30 a.m. and I worked through my
126:12 - lunch break alright so I'm gonna scroll
126:20 - up a bit so you see what I missed
126:48 - okay Sara showed there's a Bible Epsom
126:52 - Oh seriously that that would actually be
126:55 - perfect for this site I'm gonna look
126:58 - that up on my other screen that would be
127:01 - way more appropriate than Samuel Jackson
127:03 - Epsom for this site like I wouldn't mind
127:05 - it for like a side project but oh really
127:11 - cool awesome
127:18 - all right cool I'm definitely gonna use
127:21 - the Bible if some now when I need lorem
127:24 - ipsum text the rest of the site I think
127:26 - the people who are in charge of
127:29 - catechetical Institute would appreciate
127:31 - that much more than the samuel l.jackson
127:33 - or even the bacon ipsum as awesome as
127:36 - that is okay it looks like some of you
127:42 - were asking about like to see things in
127:44 - dev tools and stuff but I think that was
127:49 - in reference to the problem we're having
127:50 - and sorted that all out it was basically
127:53 - just my fault and not changing what I
127:56 - needed to change so birdperson asked and
128:02 - this was maybe 20 minutes ago so sorry
128:05 - for getting back to you a little later
128:09 - but very person as Jesse can you advise
128:12 - starting point to study react what you
128:15 - read watch Thanks so my advice would be
128:21 - to watch just to get an idea of like the
128:26 - the whole philosophy behind react
128:29 - there's some videos you can watch from
128:32 - like the react conf like Facebook's
128:35 - react conference what do they call is it
128:39 - just called react conf I can't remember
128:41 - now but if you check out the react like
128:47 - the Facebook developers YouTube or
128:49 - something I can't remember what it is
128:50 - now what the YouTube channel is for sure
128:52 - but check out like some of the keynote
128:56 - addresses where they explain the
128:59 - reasoning behind it that's kind of cool
129:00 - you don't need to know that to know
129:01 - react but it's kind of cool to get in
129:03 - the mindset of like why why even make
129:07 - another framework you know what's this
129:08 - for so that's kind of cool some of the
129:12 - talks will be like way over your head
129:13 - some of the socks are still over my head
129:16 - so you know probably don't need to watch
129:19 - them all there's some stuff about react
129:22 - on will stern has a YouTube channel
129:26 - called learn code
129:29 - Academy I think that's that's what is
129:31 - called so he has some react stuff that's
129:34 - good the videos are a little bit older
129:36 - but they still work for an introduction
129:39 - to react the react documentation on like
129:43 - the official react website is pretty
129:45 - good code Academy has like an in-browser
129:49 - react tutorial that you can go through
129:51 - this kind of nice because you don't need
129:53 - to know how to set up any development
129:54 - environments so that will be helpful and
129:59 - I think what else free code camp I
130:04 - haven't checked out the react section in
130:07 - a while I'm not sure that the react
130:09 - section is actually finished for like
130:12 - the the official courses right now the
130:16 - official challenges but the beta version
130:18 - of the challenges I think has more react
130:21 - stuff in it I I haven't checked that in
130:26 - a while so I can't say for sure so that
130:29 - those resources are what I would
130:31 - probably check out I think you could
130:35 - probably get some idea of what's going
130:38 - on and react from some of my past
130:39 - streams but my streams aren't exactly
130:42 - like a tutorial so that might be useful
130:46 - like if you were working on something
130:47 - else and just wanted to play it in the
130:49 - background and just like watch when
130:51 - something was happening that was useful
130:53 - that might be it might be helpful to you
130:57 - otherwise like it wouldn't be really
131:00 - efficient to try to watch my streams to
131:02 - actually learn anything because there's
131:05 - so much other stuff going on that it's
131:08 - not focused enough so you'll you will
131:10 - probably learn stuff but it'll be all
131:13 - over the place most of the time and the
131:16 - streams are brief can be really long so
131:18 - anyway I hope at least some of those
131:21 - resources are helpful to you and all
131:27 - right also I recommend starting out with
131:29 - something like an XJS or create react
131:32 - app just to help you get started
131:34 - building something oh also too if if you
131:38 - if you have money to spend on trying
131:42 - to learn react Udacity has a good react
131:45 - course they just started and I'm I'm
131:46 - taking the course right now and I've
131:48 - been impressed with it so far but the
131:49 - course is 500 dollars like so like in US
131:52 - dollars it's 500 dollars
131:54 - so not sure you know how much you want
131:57 - to spend on react but that that course
132:00 - has been good so far from me
132:09 - let's see okay it looks like Andrew sent
132:14 - an image I'm assuming this is of the
132:18 - admin panel that you made in react we'll
132:21 - find out in a second I'm going to open
132:22 - up on my other screen here and just say
132:26 - oops I say I think I put left this space
132:36 - in there
132:36 - there we go that's weird
132:57 - so anyway Andrew I tried to check out
132:59 - that image and it's it's giving me the
133:04 - error the error page for imager so Sara
133:14 - said in response to bird person's
133:16 - question about react the try level up
133:18 - tux or level up I'm not sure how you
133:21 - pronounce it it's level up to UTS which
133:24 - is supposed to be short for tutorials
133:26 - but I always look at it and want to say
133:29 - level up tuts
133:30 - and so I'm not sure how are you supposed
133:33 - to pronounce it yeah okay thanks
133:38 - everyone for trying to try to help out
133:43 - with the air I was having I can see now
133:45 - on the chat that you were all kind of
133:46 - asking about it but sorry about the
133:49 - silly mistake on my part
134:07 - okay so Patrick had a link that looks
134:09 - like it's gonna be useful so I'm gonna
134:11 - open this on my other screen real quick
134:13 - and if maybe I'll pull it over under my
134:16 - main screen so I get why they don't let
134:24 - you put links in the live chat but it
134:26 - ends up being annoying to have to copy
134:29 - and paste them and then take out the
134:30 - spaces and stuff so anyway this is the
134:34 - resource that patrick has just put in
134:38 - the live chat for learning react so this
134:44 - is the react redux length on github so
134:52 - it looks like it has a lot of nice stuff
134:55 - for getting started tutorials so nice
135:01 - that's that's this looks really good
135:03 - Patrick so thanks for this so this
135:06 - should be helpful to anyone it looks
135:10 - like to anyone starting out or at any
135:13 - level of trying to learn react this is
135:15 - really cool I'm definitely gonna star
135:18 - this hey I already started cool does
135:25 - that ever happen anyone else you find
135:27 - this really awesome github repo and then
135:29 - you go to start and you realize that
135:31 - you've already started at some point I
135:33 - need to go back and look through this
135:35 - stuff I've starred I'm sure I'll find
135:38 - useful stuff there that I've completely
135:40 - forgotten about but this one looks good
135:42 - it looks like it's it's kept up to date
135:44 - like I mean look this two days ago it
135:48 - was updated so that's cool sometimes you
135:50 - see nice lists like this but they're a
135:52 - little outdated but this one is kept up
135:54 - so thanks Patrick
136:08 - okay Sara also says for in terms of
136:11 - react courses also if you don't mind
136:15 - paying try West boss calm so yeah I've
136:20 - never taken any courses from there I've
136:22 - seen maybe on Twitter i'm not i don't
136:26 - remember where I've seen it maybe an
136:28 - advertisement or something for that so
136:29 - but I can't really say personally
136:32 - anything about it because I haven't
136:34 - haven't taken any any courses okay
136:39 - Sebastian says if you use map you need a
136:42 - key so since I used earlier I was
136:46 - getting the air that I needed a key but
136:49 - it was even it was on this block quote
136:50 - and I'm only pulling one thing for the
136:52 - block but quote but since I was using
136:55 - map I still needed the key which that
136:58 - makes sense I don't mind putting the key
137:00 - on there that will help me get used to
137:02 - putting the key in there all the time
137:04 - which I frequently forget to do so maybe
137:06 - if I make myself do it enough times I'll
137:09 - remember it
137:20 - Sebastien says by the way you get the
137:22 - solution to the warning in the warning
137:24 - itself yeah I know usually react is
137:28 - really good about providing really
137:31 - useful warnings
137:39 - thanks you wanna check that out now and
137:41 - actually didn't read this frameborder oh
137:44 - that's why thanks for saying that
137:47 - Sebastian because now I realized that I
137:51 - should have just read this oh man okay
137:57 - so let's just fix this right now I feel
138:01 - so so silly right now that I didn't just
138:04 - take three seconds to actually read that
138:06 - warning so basically in react it wants
138:16 - me to camelcase this let me see what's
138:21 - this when it wants allowfullscreen okay
138:23 - wants me to camelcase these I gotten
138:25 - lazy with this stuff because I have a
138:29 - NPM module that actually lets me use
138:32 - like class instead of class name and
138:34 - things like that but I guess it doesn't
138:36 - convert stuff like this let's see yeah
138:47 - it looks like I think this is new stuff
138:49 - here so it looks like it went away I I
138:52 - do want to double check just want to see
138:54 - that nice clean clean screen there yeah
139:00 - all right check it out now we only have
139:02 - I should get rid of this console log and
139:08 - this console ugh
139:14 - I'm gonna do that right now cuz
139:17 - otherwise I'll forget I think that's in
139:21 - analytic that's both in the analytics
139:23 - okay so I don't need this and I don't
139:26 - need this
139:42 - that now we're those the heirs all right
139:46 - those are the areas that I get when my
139:51 - my dev server fails all right so next
139:54 - time I see those errors I'm not just
139:55 - gonna get rid of them actually gonna
139:57 - read them and try to figure out what is
139:58 - going on but at least I won't it won't
140:04 - be quite so cluttered now that I've
140:06 - gotten rid of some of the logs okay
140:14 - Patrick says +14 west boss he's awesome
140:18 - okay so maybe that that resources we got
140:23 - two people in the live chat now
140:24 - recommending that resource so maybe I'll
140:28 - have to check it out I don't have time
140:30 - to take on another course right now
140:32 - since I'm already doing one well I'm
140:34 - already doing free code camp and Udacity
140:37 - on top of my other work and taking care
140:41 - of all my kids so maybe when I finish up
140:45 - with one of the things then I can do
140:47 - check out west boss how's the pricing on
140:51 - that is it like really expensive or you
140:54 - know compared to a lot of other courses
141:00 - okay Andrews asking about the Pomodoro
141:03 - Technique and the stuff in Trello I
141:05 - explained it like in more depth early in
141:07 - the stream so if you can check out the
141:09 - recording like you'll get a better
141:11 - explanation but basically the numbers in
141:14 - Trello or the number of Pomodoro
141:15 - sessions that each task takes so a
141:20 - Pomodoro session is 25 minutes so every
141:23 - 25 minutes I take a five-minute break
141:25 - after four sessions I take a 10-minute
141:28 - break it helps break up the work and it
141:31 - helps to more accurately estimate the
141:33 - time the tasks take so the the dark
141:35 - numbers in Trello or how many Pomodoro
141:39 - sessions I think it's going to take and
141:41 - the lighter numbers are how many it
141:43 - actually took me to do I see now that
141:49 - Sara already answered Andrews it's
141:51 - thanks there sorry I didn't see that I
141:53 - was
141:55 - anyway those those two cadets and
141:59 - Patrick answered as well to man ten as
142:04 - what software are you using for your dev
142:05 - server basically it's just like it's web
142:09 - pack but it I don't have to customize it
142:11 - myself because next Jas is automatically
142:14 - running it so that's part of the reason
142:16 - why I haven't even dug into the issue
142:17 - because I I didn't need to set it up
142:20 - myself so I know like I'm gonna have to
142:22 - learn how it was set up before I can
142:25 - even try to fix it so but basically it
142:29 - is web pack though Sebastian says I
142:35 - think you have some more posts with data
142:38 - - JSX I think you're right - because I
142:41 - was copy and pasting earlier in the day
142:42 - and I didn't remove that so I'm gonna
142:44 - have to go back and double-check
142:45 - everything
143:00 - well Andrew says in my country for West
143:03 - bust courses I get a 52% discount that's
143:05 - sweet wit what country are you from
143:07 - Andrew you probably told me before so
143:10 - sorry I don't I don't remember but we'll
143:15 - see if you if that 52% is a big discount
143:17 - it might be worth moving for I'm just
143:21 - joking it probably wouldn't be but maybe
143:24 - if you're gonna take enough courses
143:30 - Manny says have you tried fetching from
143:33 - Component did mount and saving your data
143:35 - in your app state object yeah I actually
143:38 - do that on some of the pages some of the
143:41 - components but the thing is with with
143:44 - next J s you if you want it to be able
143:48 - to render server-side you have to fetch
143:52 - the data from in here from get initial
143:54 - props so what I do if I want to put it
143:56 - into state is I end up in component did
143:58 - mount transferring the data into state
144:02 - so I still grab it here and it still
144:05 - goes to props first and then it goes
144:07 - into state and then I can you know
144:10 - manipulate the data use it after at that
144:12 - point so on this page I really don't
144:15 - have any need to save it the state
144:16 - because I'm not like I don't ever need
144:19 - to change it to make things rerender or
144:21 - happen so but on on some pages like the
144:23 - resource page I do I am doing that but
144:28 - it still I still grab everything
144:30 - initially with this get initial props
144:33 - just for the sake of the server-side
144:34 - rendering
144:50 - okay Manny says you Demi's modern react
144:53 - and redux is very awesome for starting
144:56 - out a very awesome course so albury
144:58 - person says thank you Jesse for the
145:00 - advice you're welcome I hope some of it
145:02 - is helpful to you and make sure like if
145:05 - you can come back some other live chats
145:07 - and let us know like how it's going and
145:09 - what resources you found helpful I think
145:12 - that would be awesome it'd be helpful
145:13 - for me and I'm sure would probably be
145:14 - helpful for some other people that are
145:16 - that are watching Manny says learn a lot
145:21 - from you awesome I'm glad I'm but glad
145:24 - that I could be helpful a lot of times I
145:26 - feel like I'm not really being helpful
145:28 - to you all you are teaching me a lot so
145:31 - it's nice when sometimes I I'm doing the
145:35 - teaching a little bit all right so
145:41 - Andrew posted the link again yeah me
145:45 - maybe I thought I got rid of all the
145:47 - spaces let me try it again
145:54 - yeah it did work I must have just left
145:57 - the space in there and didn't realize it
145:59 - oh very cool
146:11 - that's really cool Andrew I'm checking
146:14 - out on my other screen I don't know if
146:15 - you want me to show it to everybody in
146:17 - the live stream or not so that's why I
146:19 - open it on the other stream or the other
146:21 - screen that's really cool I like that
146:33 - yeah so if if anyone is sharing any of
146:37 - their own work by default I will just
146:39 - open it on another screen in case you
146:42 - don't want everybody to be able to see
146:45 - it in the stream you know and in the
146:47 - recording but if you don't mind that
146:49 - just let me know when you give me the
146:51 - link and then I can as long as it's
146:55 - appropriate if nobody's ever tried to
146:56 - share anything inappropriate but as long
146:58 - as it's appropriate I'll put it up there
147:01 - that's also another reason why I open it
147:03 - on a separate screen just on on the off
147:05 - chance that someone would happen to post
147:12 - something inappropriate actually that
147:16 - link the Heroku link is it's not working
147:25 - for me it's saying access denied for me
147:33 - why is it saying what are Y saying
147:36 - asketh access denied when I try to put
147:40 - the link in okay I see you posted
147:46 - another link a little a little bit after
148:09 - okay ceressus 72 and 98 so I assume
148:14 - that's in response to my question about
148:15 - the pricing for for West boss and Manny
148:18 - also recommends West boss okay that's
148:20 - not too bad actually
148:22 - oh yeah that's a decent price so 72
148:26 - dollars 98 so it seems like West boss is
148:29 - the way to go I might even have to check
148:31 - that out I mean like I said I there's no
148:33 - way I could do another course right now
148:34 - but I'll keep that in mind for the
148:35 - future okay Andrew says Moldova cool so
148:39 - you're from so I have three three of my
148:44 - wife's cousins were adopted from Moldova
148:47 - so that's what I remember when they were
148:49 - adopted they were just really little and
148:51 - could barely speak English or anything
148:54 - and I remember visiting with my wife's
148:57 - and uncle and they live they live in a
149:02 - different state so went down there and
149:05 - stayed with them for like a week and
149:06 - helped out with the kids and everything
149:08 - it was cool when now the kids are like
149:10 - they're teenagers so it makes me feel
149:14 - old
149:15 - but anyway that's cool and I I get I
149:19 - know people from Moldova
149:34 - okay rich Rishabh I'm not sure I
149:40 - pronounce a so sorry
149:41 - but rich a vas hey I just came to this
149:44 - live video I want to know how we can
149:45 - link with react I want to know
149:48 - that suit actually says so in this video
149:52 - I'm actually linking WordPress with
149:54 - react through the WordPress API so I'm
149:57 - not dealing with a database directly
150:00 - there's like the WordPress API is
150:02 - sitting between the database and it's a
150:05 - different kind so I mean WordPress uses
150:07 - a sequel database which is definitely
150:09 - different than so at some point
150:13 - it's likely that I will do something
150:16 - that uses a database with react
150:19 - but I can't I can't guarantee when that
150:22 - project will happen so so I can't answer
150:25 - your question right now unfortunately
150:27 - but I hope that in the future I can do
150:30 - more streams with with and react
150:38 - okay see you later mani
150:40 - mandis gotta head out thanks thanks for
150:44 - watching I know you're contributing in
150:48 - the latch at
150:58 - Patrick says in response to the question
151:01 - about DB says I would expect you
151:04 - would want to write a back-end service
151:06 - in something like no tour Express to
151:10 - provide endpoints for interacting with
151:12 - MongoDB yeah that's actually that's a
151:15 - really good answer so I mean that would
151:17 - be you know that wanting in specifics of
151:20 - how you do that that I mean that would
151:22 - be the way to go you obviously you
151:24 - wouldn't be reacting like you wouldn't
151:25 - be going directly from reacts like
151:28 - client-side directly to a database most
151:30 - likely you would have some sort of I get
151:33 - would you call that a middleware I don't
151:35 - know but but your back-end node Express
151:38 - would be interacting with the database
151:40 - and then sending that so
151:51 - yes Sebastian says sorry about the
151:53 - language change Sebastian just started
151:55 - talking in another language in the live
151:57 - chat or typing in another language
152:00 - birdperson says thank you very much
152:02 - Jessy I was glad to spent this time with
152:04 - FCC campers jordan says shouldn't you be
152:08 - going home Jessie yeah I should I was
152:09 - just thinking the same thing so anyway
152:12 - you're welcome birdperson so yeah I'm
152:15 - glad you spent time with us as well so
152:18 - yeah anyway I think I am gonna wrap it
152:20 - up cuz it's 7:00 and I need to go home
152:24 - and put my kids to sleep so yeah so I
152:30 - kinda hope to get a little bit more done
152:32 - but unfortunately I did have some silly
152:36 - issues that came up and we're entirely
152:38 - just my fault for not paying attention
152:41 - more closely to my code so I need to
152:45 - commit those last couple changes we made
152:48 - to get rid of the errors and that's
152:51 - about it I'm going to commit that I'm
152:53 - going to push everything up to the dev
152:55 - server and I might check the dev server
152:58 - to make sure it does it quits just
153:00 - shutting down and then that way at least
153:02 - it'll be open to anyone who wants to see
153:05 - it and then I'll I'll be here tomorrow
153:08 - morning and I'll do some more work and
153:10 - I'll see you all tomorrow I'm pretty
153:13 - sure that I can do the stream at the
153:16 - normal time tomorrow I have a meeting
153:18 - with a potential client at 5:00 p.m. so
153:24 - it won't be a super long stream but I
153:26 - could probably do like an hour hour and
153:28 - a half stream and still have enough time
153:30 - to make it to the meeting so anyway it
153:36 - was it was cool I'm glad I got to do
153:38 - this and death see some different people
153:40 - probably because of the different you
153:41 - know time that I strained that so
153:44 - tomorrow it'll be at the normal time
153:46 - most likely 2 p.m. Eastern time thank
153:49 - you so much everyone for watching and
153:51 - for helping out and in the live chat is
153:54 - really awesome and really cool just
153:57 - working on this project you you all have
153:59 - been like kind of with this project for
154:01 - the whole
154:01 - time you know pretty much from the
154:03 - beginning so this is very much like I
154:05 - think our project together and it's
154:07 - really cool so I can't wait to like be
154:09 - done with it and move on but then you
154:11 - know have this entire project from start
154:14 - to finish like all live-streamed I think
