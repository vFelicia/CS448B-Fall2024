00:00 - autocad is a popular computer-aided
00:02 - design software used to design and model
00:05 - in 2d and 3d
00:07 - in this university course you will learn
00:09 - the basics of autocad
00:12 - hello hello and welcome to ada
00:17 - a course the first course that we teach
00:19 - for the first year students in lth in
00:22 - linden university
00:24 - um and this course is all about
00:26 - showing you the basics of autocad and
00:28 - getting you into cat drawing
00:30 - so it's going to be all about
00:32 - two-dimensional drawing rather than
00:34 - three-dimensional modeling at first
00:36 - but uh even with that there's a lot of
00:39 - things to learn and a lot of things to
00:40 - understand so we'll be using autocad
00:43 - exactly for that right
00:46 - once you
00:47 - actually opened up autocad you will
00:50 - be greeted with this welcome screen
00:52 - right the start screen and the start
00:54 - screen is going to have the recent
00:57 - documents uh row or whatever
01:00 - column i guess and it's going to have
01:03 - the basic buttons get started open files
01:06 - and blah blah so recent documents is
01:08 - basically if if you're all if you have
01:10 - already worked on something
01:12 - that file is going to pop up here just
01:14 - for convenience if you haven't it's
01:16 - going to be empty right
01:18 - so instead you just press the star
01:20 - drawing and that's exactly what we're
01:22 - going to do actually let me see
01:26 - okay
01:27 - uh so we're going to click on start
01:29 - drawing
01:32 - like that
01:34 - okay so this is what we have here uh
01:36 - this this kind of user interface and you
01:38 - can't really see the top top of the row
01:41 - but
01:42 - there's basically nothing there that's
01:44 - super important it's just a bunch of
01:48 - different icons
01:49 - if you click on the large
01:52 - icon in the top left corner
01:55 - the large a button
01:57 - you will see all of the same
02:00 - tools that are available for you create
02:02 - a new file open an existing one save
02:04 - files export files publish files or
02:07 - print files i guess
02:09 - right so printing is oh actually
02:12 - i'll i'll talk about it once we get
02:14 - there right
02:15 - um but the basic menu is is here right
02:18 - it's located underneath that large a
02:20 - button
02:22 - underneath it you have what's called the
02:23 - ribbon menu
02:25 - and this is the ribbon menu has a bunch
02:27 - of tabs
02:29 - so it's like categories
02:31 - with the tools that you can use but
02:33 - honestly
02:35 - the faster you learn the commands for
02:38 - the tools rather than the
02:40 - clicking on the icons of the tools the
02:42 - better it is right because
02:43 - uh it just speeds up your drawing
02:46 - process quite a bit once you actually
02:48 - remember the shortcuts or the commands
02:50 - for the tools so honestly i almost never
02:53 - use the
02:56 - the icons anymore i just type in the
02:59 - the commands and
03:01 - anyone that you ask who is using how to
03:04 - get this the same
03:07 - nevertheless uh we will be kind of
03:09 - clicking on these and and looking where
03:11 - they are
03:12 - but also we will be memorizing the
03:15 - shortcuts for them as well
03:18 - there is this
03:21 - home tab so the home type is going to be
03:23 - 99 of the time we are going to be
03:25 - spending in the home tab
03:27 - then we have the insert tab
03:29 - i will from time to time we will go in
03:32 - here and use one or two tools from here
03:34 - there's not much here then we have the
03:37 - annotate tab where
03:38 - yeah we will be spending good time here
03:41 - as well
03:42 - every other tab is
03:44 - we ignored it it's it doesn't exist to
03:47 - us we don't care
03:48 - right so it's only these three tabs
03:51 - uh by now you might be wondering well
03:55 - that that you probably have more stuff
03:58 - here right more floating windows here
04:02 - um
04:03 - that might happen because you either
04:05 - have autocad
04:07 - architecture
04:09 - rather than just regular autocad or
04:11 - maybe
04:13 - these days autocad just ships with
04:15 - multiple open panels actually can i show
04:18 - you
04:19 - let's see if i close that
04:23 - no
04:24 - start drawing
04:27 - it doesn't open up any panels here but
04:30 - if you have any panels opened up that
04:32 - are just floating on the screen close
04:33 - them click the x buttons and then just
04:35 - close them you don't need to see them
04:37 - right just click clean up the screen
04:40 - one more thing is right now what you see
04:43 - here on the screen is me logged into a
04:45 - school's computer right so on the
04:47 - school's computers for instance
04:49 - we are running autocad architecture 2019
04:53 - and it has the home tab has these three
04:55 - dimensional tools of wall door and so on
04:59 - and also it does have the two
05:01 - dimensional
05:02 - tools
05:03 - we will not be using three-dimensional
05:04 - tools in this course at all because
05:06 - first of all autocad is not that great
05:08 - for three-dimensional modeling compared
05:10 - to competitors
05:13 - second of all it's better to first learn
05:15 - how to draw and then learn how to model
05:18 - rather than kind of trying to learn
05:20 - everything all at once it's much a
05:24 - easier learning curve that way
05:27 - um so we will be only using 2d drawings
05:31 - there's one more thing that i want to
05:33 - check and i will be checking i will
05:36 - check if there's a possibility on how to
05:38 - hide this
05:40 - and that
05:41 - the way you hide this is if you use a
05:44 - different
05:46 - profile a different viewing template and
05:48 - i'll i'll just try let me close this
05:53 - let me try to open it again
05:56 - but this time around
05:58 - what if we use
06:01 - no template metric
06:07 - now it still opens up okay fair enough
06:09 - anyway so those of you who have this
06:12 - build tab here just ignore it we will
06:14 - not be using it we will be using this
06:17 - and i'll be kind of switching back and
06:19 - forth between the two versions this
06:21 - version and the version that i have
06:24 - this version right here just so that
06:26 - everyone sees you know where different
06:28 - tools are located
06:30 - one more thing
06:31 - is the course website if we go to the
06:34 - course website
06:36 - it does have
06:39 - autocad basic commands pdf right here
06:43 - which i will open
06:45 - and actually i'll be using it too and
06:46 - this is not a lot of
06:48 - tools
06:49 - but i will be using it to go through
06:53 - these tools and kind of explain you what
06:55 - what they do before we actually begin
06:58 - well most of them
07:00 - before we begin actually going deep into
07:03 - drawing a building i will be showing how
07:05 - to do that as well but first let's just
07:08 - kind of look at the tools
07:10 - um
07:12 - so have that
07:13 - opened as well just ready for you
07:17 - right so let's jump into autocad uh back
07:20 - into autocad and here there's this grid
07:24 - that you see here is your main viewport
07:26 - right
07:27 - and it's basically a two-dimensional
07:30 - view you can make it three-dimensional
07:33 - with this box here uh by clicking on the
07:36 - on the side of the box and now it's it's
07:38 - a three-dimensional space
07:39 - three-dimensional grid but you don't
07:42 - wanna do that so
07:45 - what you do is you just click on the top
07:47 - of the box like so and it's going to
07:49 - rotate back to two dimensions we are
07:52 - going to draw it in everything in two
07:55 - dimensions flat
07:56 - right
07:58 - if your top the name top
08:01 - is not
08:03 - oriented properly
08:04 - let's see if it's like so if it's
08:07 - rotated like so just use these arrows to
08:10 - kind of rotate it back to to normal so
08:12 - this is what you want to see north
08:15 - south east west top right
08:18 - okay
08:20 - the way you
08:22 - move inside of this view
08:25 - is there's no
08:27 - there's no right click and holding
08:31 - right instead
08:32 - if you click and hold the
08:36 - scroll map or scroll wheel
08:38 - of the mouse
08:39 - you can pan the view
08:42 - right
08:43 - like that
08:45 - if you scroll the wheel of course you
08:47 - zoom out zoom in zoom out zoom in
08:50 - right into the view
08:52 - and and that's it that's all you need
08:55 - honestly you know you just need to be
08:57 - able to pan the view and zoom in to to
09:00 - the cursor by the way it always zooms
09:01 - into where you have your your cursor
09:05 - that's important
09:07 - selecting objects is that is done
09:10 - through
09:11 - by by clicking and dragging the mouse
09:13 - and by now you will notice that if you
09:15 - click and drag the mouse
09:18 - um
09:19 - with the left mouse button it kind of
09:22 - does this
09:23 - so this is what's called like a smart
09:25 - selection i absolutely hate it i or
09:29 - lasso tool lasso selection tool method i
09:32 - absolutely hate it i think it's
09:34 - obnoxious
09:35 - so the first thing that we will actually
09:37 - do is we will get rid of it right so
09:40 - let's get rid of that i just want it to
09:42 - be like a rectangular marking but it
09:45 - doesn't let me
09:46 - um to get rid of it
09:49 - here in the bottom you have the command
09:52 - line this is where you write all of the
09:54 - commands right
09:56 - um
09:56 - and i can just write options
10:00 - and hit enter
10:02 - so i wrote options i hit enter and it
10:05 - opens up options for me
10:07 - options
10:09 - um and then in the options options tab
10:12 - or options menu i can go to
10:16 - actually let's take a look at this re
10:19 - real quick just so that you know what's
10:20 - going on
10:21 - files this is basically where all of the
10:23 - supporting files are located you don't
10:25 - care about this display is you can
10:28 - change the color theme between dark and
10:30 - light
10:31 - whatever crosshair size
10:35 - let me show you i'll increase the
10:37 - crosshair size to 100 hit apply hit ok
10:41 - and now my
10:42 - my crosshair looks like this this is
10:44 - quite useful when you want to
10:47 - or my mouse this is quite useful when
10:49 - you want to align
10:52 - um
10:54 - see if stuff is aligned properly and i
10:58 - honestly
10:59 - i have been using it for quite a while
11:01 - it's quite convenient but at the same
11:03 - time
11:04 - sometimes it gets in the way right i'll
11:07 - type in options again and
11:09 - make it smaller
11:11 - was it five i think it was five i don't
11:14 - remember
11:15 - are you five yeah it was five okay
11:18 - so i'll i change it back to five
11:21 - everything else here is just basically
11:23 - how are things shown
11:25 - um i wouldn't suggest you going deep
11:28 - into this and changing stuff up
11:30 - um definitely not now later once you're
11:33 - used to the program
11:35 - opening and saving it's basically going
11:37 - to ask you what what kind of format do
11:39 - you want to always save the file in and
11:41 - that's don't argue with the program it
11:44 - knows what it's doing so don't don't
11:46 - mess around here
11:48 - plot and publish as well is it's
11:50 - basically where will you
11:53 - export out the pdfs
11:55 - don't argue with the program
11:58 - system
11:59 - [Music]
12:01 - let's ignore it user preferences let's
12:03 - definitely ignore it
12:06 - or wait
12:08 - yes
12:09 - drafting and 3d modeling
12:11 - um
12:12 - [Music]
12:15 - i'm just sorry i'm just really quickly
12:17 - going through this and seeing if there's
12:19 - anything worth mentioning
12:22 - not really
12:25 - defaults are absolutely fine 3d modeling
12:27 - we're not going to do any 3d modeling so
12:30 - we don't care and then selection so this
12:32 - is the big big boy where
12:36 - the culprit behind our lasso tool
12:39 - selection right
12:40 - so it's here allow press and drag for
12:43 - lasso this line right here in this tick
12:46 - mark right here
12:48 - is is the the culprit so i'll untick it
12:52 - and i'll just hit apply
12:54 - and hit ok
12:58 - and now it's fine
12:59 - you'll notice that the color is
13:01 - different
13:02 - depending if i'm going from bottom up or
13:05 - from top to bottom but it's uh
13:09 - it's
13:10 - i i will talk about that later
13:13 - what matters is that it's a rectangle
13:15 - right and not that ugly lasso
13:18 - okay so that's the first thing let me
13:19 - double check if in the other version in
13:23 - in this uh
13:25 - our autocad architecture version if it's
13:28 - the same i'll just go to options
13:31 - selection
13:32 - yeah it's the same allow press and drag
13:35 - for lasso and now it works okay
13:38 - let's jump back here so that's that um
13:42 - below you have a model space layout
13:45 - space and so on we will be talking about
13:47 - those uh during the last tutorial uh not
13:51 - right now and then you have a bunch of
13:53 - uh a bunch of stuff here
13:56 - uh that is not enough stuff i want to
13:59 - see more oh yeah okay that's enough
14:01 - stuff that's good we will talk about
14:03 - those as well later
14:06 - for now
14:08 - let's actually start start looking into
14:10 - the tools and start drawing right that's
14:12 - the fun part
14:14 - um
14:18 - the question is
14:21 - what's what are the units the
14:23 - measurements in which we draw is it
14:25 - centimeters is it millimeters is it
14:27 - inches is it horses per second you know
14:30 - what kind of
14:32 - dimensions are we talking about
14:34 - i need to
14:35 - actually make sure that i'm drawing for
14:38 - instance in millimeters i'm used to
14:40 - drawing in millimeters
14:42 - so what i'll do is i will type
14:44 - a command called units
14:48 - units
14:50 - enter
14:51 - [Music]
14:53 - and here i will see that indeed i am
14:56 - drawing in millimeters and this is my
14:58 - precision of drawing
15:01 - 0.0000 millimeters right so it's pretty
15:04 - damn precise
15:06 - um and degrees are or sorry the angle is
15:09 - in degrees not in radians that's great
15:12 - the precision is only
15:15 - full numbers of degrees
15:17 - which
15:19 - i have a problem with
15:22 - i do want the precision to be slightly
15:24 - larger for four degrees at least you
15:26 - know one number after the comma so i'll
15:29 - just choose 0.0
15:33 - and then lighting we don't care we don't
15:35 - care about
15:36 - once i've made sure that it's
15:38 - millimeters and degrees i'll just hit ok
15:42 - and now we know that we are drawing in
15:44 - millimeters
15:45 - okay
15:46 - now it's time to draw the easiest thing
15:48 - to draw is a line right so the line tool
15:51 - is located here
15:54 - well the one that says line
15:56 - and
15:57 - if you don't see it then you might have
15:59 - this version where yeah it's here right
16:02 - or
16:03 - the shortcut for the line tool is
16:06 - l
16:08 - enter
16:10 - l is short for line
16:12 - once you
16:13 - hit l enter or you click on this icon
16:16 - here
16:19 - you will
16:20 - start reading you will need to read what
16:23 - it's asking of you
16:25 - in the command line so the way autocad
16:28 - communicates with you
16:30 - about what it wants from you to actually
16:32 - be able to draw stuff
16:34 - is through the command line
16:38 - so here it's asking line specify first
16:41 - point
16:42 - sure i need to click somewhere right so
16:44 - i'll just click
16:46 - ok
16:47 - then command line immediately switches
16:49 - to another question specify next point
16:53 - right uh sure
16:55 - i'll click again
16:59 - and then
17:00 - autocad keeps asking me to specify next
17:03 - point uh okay
17:05 - next point okay so you can see that i
17:08 - can keep doing this this for for for a
17:11 - while right just keep drawing the
17:15 - the lines
17:16 - which is not you know at some point i
17:18 - want to stop so the way you stop is you
17:21 - just hit enter
17:24 - right to finish the tool
17:26 - to finish the command
17:28 - you hit enter and you have a bunch of
17:29 - lines so now if i hover my mouse over
17:32 - them i can see that only segments like
17:34 - these straight line segments get
17:36 - highlighted and i can kind of select
17:38 - them
17:39 - right select this one
17:40 - select that one
17:42 - like that one for instance so i can
17:44 - click on them to select
17:46 - that's cool
17:47 - uh how do i unselect well i hit escape
17:52 - escape unselects them right
17:56 - what if i want to select
17:58 - many of them
18:00 - without actually
18:02 - you know kind of clicking on each
18:03 - individual line segment well i can
18:06 - drag
18:08 - this rectangle here around the ones that
18:10 - i'm going to select
18:12 - release
18:14 - and these get selected right
18:18 - um which actually and then escape to and
18:20 - select of course uh which actually um
18:27 - yeah let's do a small small bit a small
18:29 - tutorial about selection here uh because
18:32 - we already have some geometry that's
18:34 - available for us so i'm going to
18:39 - as i mentioned before there are two ways
18:41 - of how to select the
18:43 - the blue rectangle
18:46 - which happens when you drag from left to
18:48 - right
18:49 - and the green rectangle which happens
18:51 - when you drag from right to left
18:53 - right
18:54 - so the blue rectangle only selects
18:57 - things that are completely inside
19:00 - of that
19:01 - rectangle
19:03 - right so for instance let's let's look
19:05 - at this line right here
19:07 - this this line right here right if i
19:10 - drag the blue rectangle
19:12 - and it's crossing that line
19:15 - and i release
19:16 - that line doesn't get selected because
19:18 - it's not fully inside it wasn't fully
19:21 - inside of that blue rectangle
19:24 - if
19:25 - i
19:26 - drag a green rectangle
19:28 - and it's crossing the line in the same
19:30 - way
19:31 - it is going to to be selected right
19:35 - that's because the blue line only
19:37 - selects things that are completely or
19:39 - blue rectangle a
19:41 - blue selection rectangle only selects
19:42 - things that are completely inside of it
19:44 - while the green selection rectangle
19:46 - selects things that are inside of it and
19:49 - things that it's
19:50 - hitting things that it's crossing right
19:53 - so again the blue rectangle selection
19:56 - looks like that while the green
19:58 - rectangle selection looks
20:00 - like that because it's hitting this line
20:02 - hitting this line hitting this line and
20:04 - hitting this line right
20:06 - so that's that
20:08 - um
20:10 - right so so now we have something drawn
20:13 - cool
20:14 - uh let's select all of it
20:16 - and hit delete
20:18 - you know that's how you get rid of stuff
20:21 - you just hit the delete button
20:23 - mac users backspace probably i don't
20:25 - remember you can type in delete i think
20:28 - so yes erase sorry you can type in erase
20:32 - command and it's going to erase it
20:34 - um
20:36 - let me just see here l
20:40 - same same thing
20:43 - good i'm just double checking if
20:46 - yeah
20:47 - yeah okay double checking if there are
20:49 - no kind of discrepancies between the two
20:51 - versions that's good for now
20:54 - um so that's our
20:56 - line tool which is right here that's the
21:00 - first tool let me talk more about it
21:03 - um just so that you you get
21:06 - a better idea of how things are drawn
21:09 - so that line tool again l enter for line
21:14 - l enter um
21:18 - i i will specify the first point by just
21:20 - clicking but then the second point
21:23 - let's say i want it
21:25 - at this
21:26 - angle whatever angle right but i want it
21:29 - to be
21:30 - um
21:31 - [Music]
21:32 - let's see two meters long right
21:34 - 2 000 millimeters
21:37 - so what i do is before i
21:40 - click again you know to
21:43 - to finish the tool
21:45 - or to finish the line before i click
21:47 - again i can type in the desired length
21:50 - two thousand
21:53 - you know two meters enter
21:55 - and now it becomes exactly two meters
21:58 - long in that direction
22:00 - right
22:01 - which is quite useful
22:04 - what if
22:05 - i want to draw
22:07 - this line segment
22:09 - completely horizontal
22:12 - right or completely vertical doesn't
22:14 - matter
22:16 - then the tool that does that is called
22:19 - orthographic snapping
22:21 - and the shortcut for it is f8
22:26 - f8 in the top of your keyboards f8
22:30 - or
22:32 - a button that does that
22:35 - is located right here and in the bottom
22:37 - of the screen
22:38 - ortho mode and you can see in the
22:41 - brackets it says f8 as well
22:44 - if ortho mode is turned on
22:47 - if i click on it or if i hit f8 right
22:51 - so with f8 i can turn it on or off right
22:54 - if i hit a fit or turn it on and i draw
22:57 - try to draw the line and this time let
22:59 - me just use the tool uh the icon here
23:02 - and i draw the line you can see that
23:04 - it's locked to either a horizontal or
23:07 - vertical position
23:08 - right which is quite useful for instance
23:11 - i want to say
23:13 - uh 5000 millimeters
23:17 - or not
23:19 - let's do 2 000 5000 was way too long two
23:22 - thousand millimeters five hundred
23:24 - millimeters
23:25 - uh
23:26 - a thousand millimeters
23:28 - 500 more
23:31 - 300 millimeters
23:33 - uh 750
23:37 - i don't know how long this is probably
23:40 - around
23:41 - 700 millimeters yes and then close it
23:44 - off and hit enter
23:46 - right i can have pretty precise
23:48 - dimensions
23:50 - when when i have ortho on
23:53 - so that's quite useful
23:55 - i will show you later a few more
23:59 - tips and tricks in terms of the angles
24:02 - and snapping to different angles but
24:04 - also
24:05 - turning ortho on and off is one of the
24:11 - smoothest workflows let's see or or most
24:13 - useful workflows let me get rid of this
24:17 - so that's how you how you work with
24:19 - lines and then horizontal and vertical
24:21 - snapping of of lines let me turn off
24:24 - ortho for now so i either click here on
24:27 - this icon or just hit f8 and i can see
24:30 - that that icon is turned off now
24:33 - um i can
24:34 - also i need to check
24:37 - here
24:38 - if that's the same thing
24:41 - yes you do have ortho mode here
24:45 - that's good
24:46 - um okay
24:48 - coming back here
24:49 - so that's line right um
24:52 - next up is polyline i believe
24:56 - yes next step is power line so line
25:01 - line tool is the most simplistic tool
25:03 - and it all it can do is just straight
25:06 - line segments that are all so to say
25:09 - exploded they are
25:11 - separated line segments right
25:14 - polyline tool on the other hand
25:17 - is
25:20 - it it can contain much more information
25:23 - inside of it
25:24 - what i mean by that is first of all
25:26 - let's learn the shortcut for it the
25:28 - shortcut is pl
25:29 - enter or clicking the icon of course but
25:32 - pl enter
25:34 - gives you the polyline tool
25:36 - and with
25:37 - orthographic snapping turned off i will
25:40 - just draw quickly draw a polar line
25:42 - without any dimensions whatsoever
25:45 - i'll just draw it
25:47 - whatever
25:51 - i have no idea what i'm drawing but it
25:54 - is what it is yeah let's see something
25:55 - like that and oops
25:57 - and hit enter
25:59 - to finish the the tool
26:01 - um
26:03 - so now this is a polyline rather than
26:05 - the line tool
26:06 - if i click
26:08 - on this you can see that everything gets
26:09 - selected
26:11 - this is a type of geometry that consists
26:14 - of multiple lines and all of them are
26:16 - joined into a chain of lines
26:19 - it's super convenient for selection
26:22 - purposes it's super convenient to work
26:24 - with
26:25 - and it doesn't really have any any
26:27 - drawbacks
26:30 - almost all of the lines that i draw
26:34 - during the design process
26:37 - and the technical process later on
26:39 - are polar lines not lines
26:43 - keep that in mind
26:45 - um right so we have our our polyline
26:48 - can you
26:50 - make
26:51 - apollo line
26:53 - into multiple lines right can can you
26:57 - explode the polyline into multiple lines
26:59 - yes you can of course
27:01 - you can just select it
27:03 - oh by the way if i use the blue
27:06 - selection rectangle it will not select
27:09 - unless i have the whole poly line inside
27:11 - of my blue selection rectangle while
27:14 - with the green one i can just kind of
27:16 - slightly hit it and it will select the
27:18 - whole thing quite useful
27:21 - um so right we have a polyline how to
27:24 - how do we make it into multiple lines
27:27 - how do we explode it well we use the
27:29 - explode tool
27:32 - when we have it selected we just type in
27:34 - explode
27:36 - i think it's ex
27:39 - el
27:40 - explode
27:43 - enter
27:45 - and it just explodes
27:48 - right so now all of these are separate
27:50 - line segments and then you go oh no i
27:53 - didn't want to explode it uh what do i
27:55 - do now well
27:57 - if you just did it
27:58 - really recently you can just do ctrl z
28:01 - you know undo and it's going to undo
28:04 - your tool right ctrl z control
28:07 - yeah control z this is undo ctrl y i
28:10 - believe is redo
28:13 - um
28:14 - yeah
28:16 - or
28:17 - if you don't want to do ctrl z or
28:21 - rather if you already have a bunch of
28:23 - exploded lines and you want to join them
28:25 - up well you just select all of them
28:29 - and type in join
28:31 - and hit enter
28:33 - and it just joins all of them up into
28:35 - one poll line back into one poll line so
28:37 - there is explode
28:39 - and there is join right quite useful
28:43 - okay there are more things about the
28:45 - polyline that i kind of want to show you
28:48 - [Music]
28:53 - let me just think
28:56 - if it's if it's the time if it's the
28:58 - time to show you those uh those things
29:00 - well maybe uh sure let's start pretty
29:03 - pretty hardcore pl enter
29:06 - so polyline
29:08 - i'll start drawing
29:10 - and i'll just create the first line
29:12 - segment
29:13 - and what if i don't want this to be a
29:16 - straight line what if i want this to be
29:18 - a curve an arc
29:21 - right
29:22 - i can't do that do it with a polyline
29:24 - tool
29:25 - here in the bottom you can see that it
29:28 - does have much more
29:31 - settings
29:33 - to choose from
29:34 - rather than just having give me the next
29:37 - point because it says specify next point
29:39 - or
29:40 - is it an arc is it closed would you like
29:42 - to close it is it half wave and so on so
29:45 - there are a lot of hidden settings in
29:47 - these tools
29:49 - that you will kind of you will learn
29:51 - them once you need them
29:53 - let's say it like that right once you
29:55 - have a problem to solve then you will
29:58 - learn that different tools have
30:00 - different like small settings that you
30:01 - can tweak to solve that problem
30:04 - we definitely don't have time to go
30:06 - through all of the settings of all of
30:08 - the tools and autocad it's a little bit
30:10 - too big
30:11 - for that
30:12 - but the basic one that i want to show
30:14 - you is the arc right
30:16 - and you can see that a is highlighted
30:19 - right so what i'm going to do is i could
30:22 - just click here but rather i will press
30:24 - a
30:26 - type in a as i'm still drawing the
30:28 - polyline by the way i'll press a hit
30:31 - enter
30:32 - and now i'm in what's called an arc mode
30:36 - right so you can see that all of the
30:37 - tools have changed
30:39 - or not the tools the settings have
30:41 - changed and i have more more even more
30:43 - settings to work with but for now i'll
30:46 - just work with this right so i have the
30:49 - arc tool
30:51 - and i can mess around with it
30:54 - quite a bit
30:56 - say something like that
30:59 - and now if i want to change it back
31:02 - to the line tool
31:03 - i all i need to do is just type in l
31:07 - and hit enter
31:08 - and now we're continuing uh we continue
31:11 - drawing in straight line segments
31:13 - right
31:17 - once we're done we just hit enter and
31:19 - now we have this kind of polyline
31:23 - uh quite nice quite quite useful which
31:25 - can also by the way be exploded and
31:28 - you know
31:29 - these settings or these these arcs can
31:32 - be
31:33 - deleted off and and whatnot
31:36 - uh
31:38 - yo
31:39 - why is my okay my autocad just lagged a
31:42 - bit but that's fine
31:44 - so that's polyline and that's all of the
31:46 - not all of them uh just one hidden
31:49 - setting inside of polyline i will show
31:51 - you more uh
31:53 - later
31:54 - once once we actually need them
31:57 - right let's
31:58 - cross off polyline from our
32:02 - list and then we have the arc tool and
32:04 - the circle tool oh yeah i already showed
32:06 - you
32:07 - [Music]
32:09 - i already showed you the advanced pollen
32:11 - apologies for that for not keeping to
32:13 - the script
32:14 - i just wanted to show it to you
32:17 - okay let's jump to arc and circle tools
32:21 - um
32:22 - i will
32:24 - well they are located here of course
32:26 - circle arc right and also
32:30 - um
32:32 - also here you have the arc
32:35 - and you have the circle uh but you don't
32:38 - have the power line here but if you
32:40 - expand it by clicking this this small uh
32:44 - triangle here you will see the poll line
32:46 - pop up here
32:48 - again i do suggest you using the command
32:50 - line instead
32:52 - so we have the arc in the circle
32:56 - well
32:57 - let's start with the circle it's easier
32:58 - so circle is c
33:01 - enter
33:03 - you just click on where you
33:06 - want the circle center to be
33:08 - and you
33:10 - kind of type in the radius that you want
33:13 - let's see 250
33:15 - right so now we know that the diameter
33:16 - of the circle is 500 radius 250 and it's
33:19 - located right here cool
33:22 - um what else can we do with a circle
33:26 - let's see c enter
33:28 - there's like uh there are a few options
33:32 - here that we can use and i will for
33:34 - instance without clicking anywhere i
33:36 - will just select this three point
33:39 - uh 3p
33:40 - option
33:42 - like that
33:43 - and now i will click three times on the
33:46 - screen
33:47 - right
33:49 - and you can see that those three clicks
33:52 - that i made describe
33:56 - the the circle's position and radius
33:58 - right so that circle is touching those
34:01 - three points that i that i clicked i can
34:03 - do it again
34:05 - uh c enter
34:07 - three points
34:08 - click
34:10 - click
34:12 - and then if i say that well actually i
34:14 - want the third one to be right here
34:17 - it's going to be like a very weird
34:19 - circle
34:22 - click the three points again circle is
34:25 - touching them pretty cool
34:27 - then we have the arc tool which is
34:29 - basically i believe it's a yeah a short
34:33 - for arc hit enter
34:35 - and it's basically specify start point
34:37 - of arg
34:38 - okay
34:39 - specify second point of arc
34:42 - okay
34:43 - specify the end of arc
34:45 - okay
34:46 - so we have our arc
34:48 - done here if i want it to be a little
34:52 - bit
34:53 - um
34:54 - if i want to draw it differently i can
34:57 - by the way when you hit enter
34:59 - if you don't have any commands running
35:01 - and you hit enter it repeats the last
35:03 - command that you did so now i don't need
35:05 - to type in a enter i can just hit enter
35:08 - and it's going to kind of repeat the
35:10 - the previous command which was arc
35:13 - um
35:14 - instead of specifying the start point i
35:16 - will choose center here
35:18 - so i'm starting to draw from the center
35:21 - see from here and then it's going to ask
35:24 - me to give it the start
35:26 - and to give it the end
35:29 - right
35:30 - i'm basically just drawing part of the
35:33 - circle well arc is an arc is a part of a
35:36 - circle
35:38 - okay so that's that that's the circle
35:41 - and that's the arc that there's nothing
35:42 - more honestly to them
35:45 - um
35:46 - there's also like rectangle tools and
35:48 - whatnot uh perhaps i should wait
35:51 - i will be showing you rectangle tools
35:54 - later
35:56 - though there's no
35:59 - i haven't even
36:01 - written it down here so sure
36:05 - let's let's ignore them
36:06 - um
36:09 - for now
36:11 - circle arc
36:13 - line polyline
36:16 - is enough to describe okay so these four
36:20 - tools circle arc line polyline are
36:22 - enough to describe any kind of geometry
36:26 - absolutely
36:27 - like there's no type of geometry
36:31 - that you couldn't draw out
36:34 - with these tools
36:36 - right
36:37 - so the basics are super simple
36:40 - and what a rectangle is is basically a
36:42 - polyline with
36:45 - like
36:46 - parallel line segments right
36:50 - making it a rectangle
36:52 - i will just really quickly show it to
36:54 - you and then we'll jump jump into
36:56 - snapping possibilities
36:59 - so
37:00 - rectangle
37:01 - rectangle
37:03 - i just like to write erect
37:06 - but wait
37:08 - r e
37:11 - c
37:11 - r e c is is enough for for rectangle to
37:15 - start
37:16 - working as a command
37:18 - but i i don't know why i have a muscle
37:21 - memory of typing in r e c t rect
37:25 - hit enter
37:27 - uh it's gonna start drawing the
37:29 - rectangle and it's going to ask me to
37:31 - give it the first point sure i will just
37:34 - click
37:35 - and that's going to ask me to give it
37:37 - another corner point right
37:40 - or
37:41 - or
37:43 - i can give it the dimensions so i think
37:45 - dimensions is a much more useful use
37:48 - case than just giving it two points so i
37:50 - will choose dimensions
37:53 - and i'll say specify length for a
37:55 - rectangle so i will say well my length
37:58 - should be
37:59 - again two meters
38:00 - two thousand millimeters that's the
38:02 - length
38:03 - i hit enter and then i specify with
38:06 - four rectangles so i'll say
38:08 - let's do a pretty
38:10 - narrow one so i'll say
38:12 - 10 centimeters 100 millimeters right 100
38:16 - enter
38:19 - that's it right
38:21 - it kinda is asking me for oh right right
38:24 - right sorry sorry that's not it
38:27 - once we added the
38:28 - the
38:29 - dimensions
38:31 - now with a
38:33 - mouse click i need to specify
38:36 - the alignment of the rectangle
38:38 - is it going down or is it going up right
38:40 - down or up down or up i'll say up and
38:43 - i'll just
38:44 - click that's it now it's done right and
38:48 - we have a rectangle which is basically
38:50 - just a polyline if i grab the polyline
38:52 - pl i start started working with it with
38:56 - ortho on which is f8 and i typed in 2
38:59 - 000 enter and i typed in 100 enter
39:03 - 2000
39:04 - enter
39:05 - clicked here enter
39:07 - that's it that's this absolutely like
39:10 - these two geometries
39:13 - are absolutely the same
39:17 - right
39:19 - so that's that
39:21 - okay
39:22 - let's
39:23 - let's look
39:24 - into delete that let's look into
39:28 - object snapping and ways of how you can
39:31 - snap to
39:33 - different parts of objects and you know
39:35 - kind of merge everything together much
39:38 - more or rather use geometry
39:41 - as reference for creating more geometry
39:45 - you'll see what i mean
39:47 - the second
39:50 - all right so object snapping
39:53 - here in the bottom
39:54 - uh right here
39:58 - you will see
39:59 - oh snap tool object snap tool
40:03 - uh which basically that small arrow
40:06 - right next to it
40:07 - will
40:08 - expand will expand
40:11 - there we go a menu oh
40:14 - right
40:17 - there we go
40:19 - just fixing it uh we'll expand the menu
40:22 - or what types of
40:25 - sub geometries can you snap to so there
40:27 - are like end points of lines there are
40:30 - midpoints of lines and so on so i will
40:33 - i'll start showing you
40:35 - um
40:36 - different ways or or yeah different ways
40:38 - of how you can snap your geometry
40:41 - so for now
40:43 - let us
40:45 - untick
40:47 - all of the snaps
40:49 - all together
40:50 - right
40:51 - so nothing is marked
40:53 - click anywhere on the screen and let's
40:56 - draw
40:57 - a line right just a line
41:01 - line
41:02 - from here
41:03 - and i will be drawing it straight
41:06 - like vertical
41:08 - i'll just give it
41:09 - so if you can't just f8 or ortho snap
41:13 - turn it on and then you will be able to
41:16 - uh and i'll just give it 2 000
41:18 - millimeters
41:19 - hit enter
41:22 - enter again
41:25 - right
41:26 - now it's drawn
41:28 - and
41:29 - honestly i just want to move it away
41:31 - from the zero zero zero coordinate so
41:34 - this guy right here is my zero zero zero
41:37 - so i will just select it
41:39 - m enter empty move
41:42 - i'll just move it away
41:46 - so when i try to move it with
41:48 - orthographic snap
41:51 - uh maybe i need to do this slower sorry
41:54 - sorry i'm speeding i will select it
41:57 - m
41:58 - enter m short for move enter i will
42:00 - click anywhere on the screen
42:03 - doesn't matter where i click
42:05 - and then as i kind of move my mouse you
42:07 - can see that you know it's it's being
42:09 - moved
42:10 - in relation to my mouse cursor
42:13 - but since i have orthographic snapping
42:15 - turned on it can only move horizontally
42:17 - or vertically right i'll hit f8 or
42:21 - turn off or to snap here
42:23 - and now i can move it anywhere on on the
42:25 - screen so i'll just move it somewhere
42:27 - here it doesn't matter away from the
42:29 - zero zero zero
42:32 - i'll zoom into it
42:34 - right so that's my my line tool
42:38 - now since we have all of the object
42:40 - snapping turned off if i want to create
42:43 - let's say a circle
42:45 - or
42:46 - yeah let's say a circle around
42:48 - this endpoint i can't because
42:53 - well i can't snap to it
42:55 - and i can get pretty close but the
42:57 - closer i zoom in
42:59 - uh
43:01 - i keep seeing that there's an error in
43:03 - my uh it's going to be an error in my uh
43:07 - in the center point where where i place
43:09 - it right so this is not to work instead
43:12 - let me hit escape to close that tool
43:15 - instead i am going to
43:18 - tick mark
43:20 - the end point snapping here
43:23 - that's enabled now
43:25 - and now if i choose my circle
43:30 - circle tool
43:31 - i can click on it
43:34 - oh
43:35 - actually when i choose my circle tool
43:37 - and i hover my mouse next to the end
43:40 - point you can see that there's this
43:42 - green icon appearing that green icon
43:45 - basically tells me that i am going to
43:47 - snap and i'm going to start drawing from
43:49 - this point right from this end point and
43:52 - it even says end point right
43:54 - that means if i now click
43:58 - the center point of this circle is right
44:01 - at the end of that line so i can make it
44:03 - larger
44:05 - um yeah let's say 300 millimeters
44:08 - and hit enter
44:11 - so now i have my line tool or or my
44:14 - circle directly centered around the
44:17 - endpoint of the line
44:18 - i can do this again
44:20 - c enter from here
44:22 - 300 enter
44:25 - right i have my two circles
44:28 - uh that's the first thing that you can
44:30 - snap to another thing that you can snap
44:32 - to
44:33 - is the midpoint right so let me enable
44:36 - that
44:38 - enable midpoint
44:41 - again i'll get the circle
44:44 - i'll start drawing the circle or rather
44:47 - i'll hover my mouse over the where i
44:51 - imagine the midpoint of the line is
44:53 - going to be which is right here
44:55 - i'll click
44:56 - and start drawing
44:58 - right
44:59 - so you can see that it even gives me the
45:01 - mark
45:02 - let me do that again
45:04 - as as i'm hovering it even gives me the
45:06 - triangular mark here and says midpoint
45:09 - right i'll draw drag draw it out and
45:12 - i'll say 500
45:14 - for the radius right
45:16 - this circle is located directly in the
45:18 - middle of this line
45:21 - a circle
45:23 - at least to my knowledge
45:27 - yes
45:27 - the circle doesn't have neither a start
45:30 - or endpoint or it doesn't have a
45:32 - midpoint as well because it's infinite
45:34 - in
45:34 - in its length right
45:37 - so you can't snap to a circle
45:40 - in in this way
45:44 - said that there is the center
45:46 - snapping
45:48 - that we can do right
45:50 - center snapping for a circle so what i'm
45:53 - going to do is i will create one more
45:55 - circle
45:59 - somewhere close by somewhere i don't
46:01 - know maybe here
46:03 - i'll create one more circle and i'll
46:05 - just give it 500 millimeters again
46:09 - right
46:10 - and i will enable
46:12 - center snapping here
46:16 - i'll draw
46:18 - let's just draw another circle inside of
46:20 - the circle right
46:22 - so i'll choose a circle tool again
46:24 - and now as i
46:26 - as i hover my mouse on the edge of the
46:28 - circle you can see that green uh circle
46:32 - appearing or green markup appearing
46:35 - right in the middle
46:36 - right if i click
46:40 - my next circle is going to be drawn in
46:42 - the middle of the previous one
46:45 - right so i can give it 300
46:47 - millimeters for instance and i can keep
46:49 - doing that right i can keep hitting
46:52 - enter
46:53 - you repeat the last command i can keep
46:55 - drawing
46:56 - drawing it out
46:58 - like so
47:03 - okay
47:04 - that's one thing
47:08 - next up we have geometric sender so
47:10 - geometric center is different from a
47:12 - center point in the sense that
47:15 - um
47:16 - i believe if you have a rectangle let me
47:19 - just check
47:21 - i don't want to lie
47:25 - okay if you have a
47:26 - if you just use the center snapping
47:30 - right
47:31 - it doesn't have
47:32 - um
47:34 - it only works on arcs
47:37 - and it only works on circles it doesn't
47:40 - work on closed shapes
47:43 - so if you have some sort of a closed
47:45 - shape such as a
47:46 - rectangle
47:48 - then geometric snapping is going to
47:52 - be the way to go right so i'll turn on
47:55 - geometric center
47:57 - or geometric center snapping sorry it's
47:59 - going to be the way to go i'll turn on
48:00 - geometric center
48:03 - and as i am moving along this this this
48:07 - rectangle you can see that the middle
48:10 - while it gives me that
48:13 - snowflake thingy
48:15 - it doesn't give me a green
48:17 - green icon meaning that i can't snap to
48:20 - it but
48:21 - if now i hover my mouse close to that
48:25 - snowflake
48:26 - now i'm able
48:28 - now i'm able to snap
48:29 - right i'll repeat it again hovering my
48:32 - mouse
48:34 - finding that
48:36 - until i see that that snowflake appear
48:40 - clicking on it and dragging out
48:43 - like that
48:45 - okay
48:46 - so that's done um
48:48 - so that's geometric center uh there's
48:51 - more stuff that you can do for instance
48:53 - if you have a polyline uh which makes a
48:56 - weird form
49:00 - something like that
49:01 - and as long as that polyline is closed
49:03 - meaning
49:04 - it needs to end where it started
49:07 - click
49:08 - and then hit enter
49:09 - right it's it's a closed polyline right
49:11 - now
49:12 - and i grab a circle
49:16 - it will show me where the geometric
49:18 - centroid is right
49:20 - and i can't snap to it but it's of
49:23 - course going to be funky
49:25 - it is accurate mathematically it is an
49:27 - accurate geometric centroid of this
49:29 - particular shape but it might be
49:31 - counterintuitive for you visually right
49:36 - seeing it there
49:37 - the way it's calculated is basically
49:40 - it's an average of all of the corners
49:43 - the average coordinate of all of the
49:45 - corners of this polyline just for for
49:48 - the geeks out there who want to know how
49:50 - it works
49:52 - okay
49:53 - so that's that um then we have node
49:56 - snapping which
49:58 - i don't care
50:00 - never use it it's basically if you have
50:02 - points in in your
50:04 - in your drawing we will not be using
50:06 - points so
50:07 - we don't care
50:09 - i will not be even showing you this
50:11 - quadrant snapping though is quite useful
50:13 - uh if i select it
50:16 - i tick mark that
50:18 - now every circle
50:20 - that i drew
50:21 - has a quadrant right it has a quadrant
50:24 - here here here and here
50:27 - i can actually show them by choosing a
50:30 - circle or rather on this one
50:33 - and i can see that now i can snap to
50:35 - this
50:37 - spot here
50:39 - i can snap to this spot here
50:42 - this spot here
50:45 - and this spot here
50:47 - right
50:48 - so i can i can snap to four points on
50:52 - each of the circles
50:53 - quite useful in in some cases
50:56 - right
51:01 - and you can kind of go even deeper and
51:03 - then kind of keep keep snapping to those
51:05 - to those
51:06 - quadrants to create pretty
51:09 - pretty intense graphics
51:13 - um right
51:15 - so that's quadrant snapping
51:18 - next up
51:19 - we have intersection
51:21 - so a very simple
51:24 - simple explanation would be if i have a
51:26 - line tool
51:27 - you know i just draw a line here and i
51:29 - draw another one here
51:31 - right
51:32 - let me actually draw another
51:34 - one come on i'll enter
51:38 - another one right here
51:40 - if i want to snap to that particular
51:42 - point i can
51:44 - by using the intersection snap right so
51:46 - it kind of finds all of the places where
51:49 - two geometries intersect right
51:52 - so i can draw a circle around that
51:55 - intersection now
51:57 - quite useful
51:58 - in this case you might kind of be using
52:00 - it for
52:02 - for this
52:04 - for instance
52:08 - right and then even smaller
52:15 - right
52:16 - so so that's in intersections it just
52:18 - finds intersections between any kind of
52:21 - two two two geometries
52:24 - any type of two geometries
52:28 - uh right
52:29 - so that's in intersection snapping next
52:32 - next next there's extension snapping um
52:36 - later not now
52:38 - ignore insertion snapping no
52:41 - perpendicular snapping though is super
52:43 - useful
52:44 - um
52:45 - let's say i have a line or rather we
52:47 - already already have a line i want to
52:50 - draw another line from somewhere here
52:53 - let's say from the center of this circle
52:56 - that would go
52:57 - at 90 degrees angle to this line segment
53:01 - right
53:03 - so i want to start drawing a line from
53:04 - here
53:05 - from the middle
53:07 - and i want it to snap
53:09 - to 90 degrees which is going to be
53:12 - somewhere here probably
53:14 - over here
53:15 - uh i want to snap it at 90 degree angle
53:18 - to this line so the way i do it is i
53:21 - enable i'll escape out of that enable
53:25 - perpendicular snapping
53:27 - like this
53:29 - grab the line tool
53:31 - start drawing
53:33 - and then it will give me where the
53:36 - perpendicular snap is once i click there
53:39 - hit enter
53:40 - i can see that between these two lines i
53:43 - have 90 degree angle
53:45 - really really useful stuff if you want
53:48 - to
53:49 - let me delete that if if you want to for
53:52 - instance if you have more
53:55 - circles here
53:57 - and you need to
53:59 - kind of find the 90 degree snap from
54:02 - these two circles to this circle for
54:04 - instance
54:05 - you can always do that and then kind of
54:08 - continue on finding the snaps
54:10 - to
54:12 - that's a very tight fit for that i need
54:15 - to zoom in but yeah
54:17 - right
54:18 - so that's quite useful
54:21 - um let me get rid of those two lines
54:24 - though
54:26 - right so so that's
54:28 - perpendicular or in other words 90
54:30 - degree snapping
54:32 - then we have tangent snapping tangent
54:34 - snapping is basically
54:36 - um it's much easier for me to show than
54:39 - it is to
54:40 - actually
54:44 - explain
54:46 - let's say we have well we already have a
54:48 - circle here
54:50 - and let's say we want to draw
54:53 - we have one more circle here uh we want
54:56 - to draw from the middle of the circle
54:59 - from here
55:00 - a line that's going to seamlessly
55:03 - connect
55:04 - to the circle right here that is called
55:06 - the tangent line right and let me make
55:09 - sure that i have it turned on i don't
55:12 - tangent there we go now we have it
55:13 - turned on
55:15 - and now i can draw from the middle
55:18 - and find
55:20 - this icon here tangent
55:23 - click
55:24 - enter
55:25 - so now as the circle is going here
55:29 - it will seamlessly transition to this
55:31 - line
55:32 - and actually uh visually explaining it i
55:35 - think
55:36 - uh let me do one thing i will explain
55:38 - that tool in
55:40 - later stages of of this project or of
55:43 - this tutorial
55:45 - but
55:46 - let me just do do this real real quick
55:51 - this line and the way it connects to the
55:53 - arc is now seamless there there is no
55:56 - sharp corner right so that's a tangent
55:59 - let me undo that
56:02 - engines are quite uh quite useful
56:06 - in that regard
56:10 - um
56:11 - right
56:13 - i don't know what i'm what i'm drawing
56:15 - here
56:16 - something something weird
56:18 - something weird for sure
56:22 - so we have tangents right
56:26 - maybe one goes here maybe one goes here
56:31 - sure why not
56:32 - um
56:34 - next
56:35 - next next next next next
56:37 - nearest snap
56:39 - oh and that's actually going to be the
56:40 - last one because apparent intersection i
56:42 - don't like that kind of snapping i
56:44 - prefer
56:45 - a different work method so i will not be
56:47 - showing that nearest snapping is quite
56:51 - quite useful once you have it turned on
56:53 - and you want to create a circle just
56:55 - somewhere on this line it will
56:57 - constantly give you
56:59 - the nearest point to that line right or
57:02 - nearest point here
57:05 - right or nearest point here right so you
57:07 - can kind of just
57:11 - create a bunch a bunch of of of circles
57:19 - on on another well if you actually don't
57:23 - don't if you don't miss it
57:25 - see enter
57:27 - a bunch of circles
57:30 - on already existing geometry right
57:33 - so that's actually any point that is
57:36 - closest will be fetched by the nearest
57:38 - snapping um
57:41 - that's about it that's about it in in
57:42 - terms of snapping tools
57:45 - um the
57:47 - key thing is you don't want to have all
57:49 - of the snapping tools enabled because it
57:51 - gets too convoluted it tries to
57:54 - suggest too many ways of how you can
57:57 - snap to geometry and it
57:59 - it becomes a little bit tricky a little
58:01 - bit bothersome to to work around
58:04 - work around that so usually what i like
58:06 - to do is i like to turn off tangent
58:09 - snapping i like to turn on off sorry
58:12 - intersection quadrant snapping geometric
58:15 - center and center and i just leave end
58:17 - point midpoint perpendicular and nearest
58:20 - snapping those are the mostly used ones
58:22 - if i need some other snapping method i
58:24 - will enable it just for that particular
58:26 - tool
58:28 - a shortcut of how to turn on or off
58:31 - object snapping is f3
58:34 - button f3 uh but yeah usually i just
58:39 - always have it turned on
58:43 - oh beautiful graphics that we've made
58:45 - here all right so that is snapping right
58:48 - and that is snapping let's take a look
58:52 - if everything is
58:54 - all right here
58:56 - that's the same thing here uh
58:58 - in this workspace as well
59:01 - good very
59:02 - good um right
59:05 - so next up we have
59:07 - the different ways of how you can modify
59:09 - geometry right
59:11 - so you can move it you can copy it you
59:13 - can rotate scale it mirror it trim it
59:15 - extend it blah blah
59:18 - let's go through them
59:20 - let's go through them and once we are
59:26 - yeah once we are done with this
59:29 - then we will start drawing our house
59:33 - little by little
59:34 - right so first thing is move right
59:37 - that's a pretty simple one let's say i
59:39 - want to
59:41 - i have this geometry here i don't know
59:43 - which one to choose let's see all of
59:45 - this i have i want all of this to move
59:48 - away
59:49 - or to move somewhere uh maybe to snap to
59:52 - uh to this point right here right i can
59:55 - do that by selecting all of it typing in
59:58 - m
59:58 - hitting enter m short for move hitting
60:01 - enter
60:02 - giving it saying
60:03 - the base point so
60:05 - clicking where i want the base point to
60:07 - be and i actually want the base point to
60:09 - be in the middle right and i can't
60:11 - select the middle because i turned off
60:13 - the object snapping so i will actually
60:15 - go in here and turn on center snapping
60:19 - right here
60:20 - so now i can select the middle
60:23 - click
60:24 - and now i can move it
60:26 - again if you can only move it
60:28 - horizontally or vertically then you need
60:30 - to hit f8 or turn off ortho snapping
60:35 - orthographic snapping
60:37 - um
60:38 - so i can move it now
60:40 - and i will just move it let's say to
60:42 - here doesn't matter or maybe to the
60:44 - midpoint here yeah sure to the midpoint
60:46 - here i'll just move it to the midpoint
60:48 - here click again that's it
60:51 - it's now located here right
60:55 - um also
60:57 - just like move there is copy i can
61:00 - select the geometry i can type in copy
61:03 - cop
61:04 - i think yeah c o okay c o is enough but
61:08 - i use cop for some reason
61:10 - co
61:12 - enter
61:13 - again from the midpoint let's say to
61:17 - ah for now i'll just kind of make a few
61:19 - copies
61:20 - uh horizontally so i'll just hit f or
61:23 - vertically i'll just hit f8
61:26 - click
61:28 - click if you want to copy or move
61:31 - something by a fixed amount
61:33 - then instead of just clicking you first
61:35 - describe the
61:37 - direction let's see it's my horizontal
61:39 - direction towards here and then you type
61:41 - n by how much so i will just say by 500
61:45 - millimeters enter
61:47 - well that's not a lot but you get the
61:49 - idea right so
61:50 - the initial geometry was copied to the
61:52 - side by 500 millimeters
61:56 - okay
61:56 - that's move and copy then we have scale
62:00 - scale is basically just changing the
62:01 - size of the object
62:03 - you can either scale a single object
62:05 - select one
62:06 - scale
62:08 - type in scale or sc
62:11 - word for scale enter
62:14 - and then select the point around which
62:17 - you're going to scale the object from
62:18 - which you're going to enlarge or shrink
62:20 - the object so let's say it's going to be
62:23 - this corner point right here or the
62:25 - middle of the circle doesn't matter this
62:27 - corner point right here and i'll just
62:29 - say that the scale needs to be
62:33 - five
62:35 - right
62:37 - five is five hundred percent five times
62:40 - larger right so this guy becomes five
62:43 - times larger
62:44 - i'll ctrl z to undo
62:46 - i'll select it again
62:48 - and i'll scale
62:52 - again around the same point but this
62:54 - time around i'm going to say 0.5
62:58 - that is 50
63:00 - not 500 that is half of the size right
63:03 - so it gets
63:04 - shrunken down
63:06 - that scaling
63:07 - um nothing nothing fancy about it
63:10 - then we have i believe mirror right
63:14 - yes we have mirroring so mirror is quite
63:17 - cool let me get rid of this
63:20 - let's say you already have this geometry
63:22 - done
63:23 - or not done but you have some sort of
63:25 - geometry and you want to mirror it to
63:27 - the other side usually you do that with
63:29 - doors and whatnot uh but let's just say
63:31 - you want to mirror it i can select all
63:33 - of it and type in mi hit enter am i
63:36 - short for mirror hit enter
63:39 - and then it's going to give ask me to
63:42 - draw a mirror line so it's basically
63:44 - going to be like the line
63:46 - around which it's going to mirror it's
63:48 - much easier to show than to
63:52 - than to kind of talk about it so that's
63:54 - my mirror line let me hit f8 to turn it
63:56 - off and now it's i think it's even
63:59 - easier to see what's going on right
64:03 - so now i can mirror this
64:06 - quite useful
64:08 - right
64:10 - that's my mirroring
64:13 - and i can do this uh
64:15 - this way
64:17 - oh yeah and once you're finished
64:19 - mirroring it's going to ask you would
64:20 - you like to erase source objects or no
64:23 - so would you like to delete the initial
64:26 - one or would you like to keep it i will
64:28 - say don't erase just keep it so no
64:31 - so we have mirrored this right and i can
64:34 - kind of do it again
64:36 - mirror
64:37 - let's say between these two points like
64:40 - that enter
64:42 - right now i have this kind of geometry
64:44 - going on
64:46 - um
64:48 - let me just double check
64:51 - here
64:55 - whatever any kind of geometry
64:58 - i select all of it
65:00 - mirror
65:02 - here
65:04 - well
65:04 - in case of here it doesn't ask you right
65:07 - next to the cursor but it asks you
65:10 - um here in the in the command line would
65:13 - you like to erase source objects yes or
65:15 - no by default it said to know so you
65:17 - just hit enter and you know it's done
65:21 - so that works in in in both versions as
65:24 - well
65:25 - so that's mirroring
65:27 - i really want to draw a line here so i
65:29 - will
65:30 - um maybe not from there maybe from here
65:34 - to here
65:36 - i don't know
65:38 - i i i just think it's it's uh it's gonna
65:41 - look better if if we have some some
65:43 - geometry in between
65:45 - so that's that that that is basically
65:47 - mirroring
65:49 - next
65:52 - trim trim and extend okay
65:58 - so for trimming i actually need to show
66:00 - it with a much simpler example and then
66:03 - we'll go in here and kind of i'll show
66:06 - you how to trim stuff in here
66:08 - uh so a very simple example would be i
66:10 - have a circle
66:12 - i have a line
66:15 - right
66:16 - and the line crosses the circle i want
66:18 - to get rid of this line segment that is
66:21 - inside
66:22 - of the circle
66:24 - i can type in tr
66:27 - trim
66:28 - enter it's going to
66:30 - tell me to select objects
66:33 - and unfortunately it doesn't say
66:36 - what kind of objects
66:38 - or
66:39 - select all so i can just hit enter
66:42 - to say select all
66:44 - enter right and it's then just going to
66:48 - say okay what would you like to trim so
66:51 - i want to trim this right i just hover
66:53 - my mouse over it and you can see that
66:55 - it's gone if i click it's really gone
66:57 - right so i can trim it away so what it
67:00 - does what trimming does it finds
67:02 - intersections right into intersection
67:04 - moments and it deletes geometry
67:07 - inside of those intersection moments
67:10 - or not necessarily inside because you
67:12 - can do
67:14 - you can do something like this
67:16 - pr enter enter
67:19 - double enter remember
67:20 - and then click here
67:23 - click here right
67:25 - it just finds the intersections and kind
67:27 - of delete stuff that's that's sticking
67:29 - out or going in so
67:32 - you're basically erasing segments
67:34 - uh in that way
67:36 - so if if i were to look at the more
67:39 - complex uh more complex example let's
67:41 - say i want to clean this up
67:44 - i can say tr enter
67:46 - enter and then then i can just kind of
67:48 - go to town and keep keep deleting this
67:51 - and i'll purposely make a mistake or not
67:54 - a mistake but i'll i'll do a thing that
67:56 - always happens
67:58 - and i'll keep kind of going here and
68:01 - trimming away
68:03 - all of these segments
68:05 - and at a certain point i can't anymore
68:09 - well i can still trim away this one i
68:11 - think yes
68:12 - but now i can't trim well i can't trim
68:14 - this there we go
68:16 - now i can't trim anything else never
68:18 - mind now i can't trim anything else
68:21 - there we go so these two segments here
68:23 - right can't be trimmed and the reason
68:26 - for that is they they both meet at their
68:29 - end points so there's no way for me to
68:32 - kind of you know these are full segments
68:34 - that are meeting
68:36 - in their endpoints and they're not being
68:37 - crossed by any geometry right so the
68:40 - trimming will not work on them so then i
68:42 - just kind of select them and delete them
68:43 - right so that they get trimmed away
68:47 - uh as you're using trimming
68:50 - pr enter it will you you can choose to
68:54 - select objects rather than selecting all
68:57 - so i can select for instance these two
68:59 - objects hit enter and now
69:02 - everything that i trim
69:07 - right it's just going to be trimmed by
69:09 - those two objects and why can't i trim
69:12 - this
69:13 - i can it's just i need to zoom in
69:17 - fair enough
69:19 - right um and of course it can also
69:22 - you can also trim objects themselves
69:25 - so these are like active objects during
69:27 - trimming um
69:29 - what that means is that i can't when i
69:32 - do it that way i can't just jump in here
69:34 - and start trimming it won't let me
69:36 - because it's
69:37 - it it has nothing to do with with these
69:40 - this geometry right here so i do prefer
69:43 - using tr enter and then just hitting
69:45 - enter again
69:47 - and then going
69:48 - going in here and trimming away
69:50 - um anything that i
69:53 - that i want in any part of the drawing
69:56 - right
69:57 - much much more convenient for me with
70:01 - that select all method
70:04 - right
70:05 - that's that's that let me just clean it
70:07 - up because i like stuff when it's clean
70:13 - there we go
70:14 - okay
70:16 - uh wait nope
70:18 - er enter enter
70:19 - yeah almost
70:22 - almost forgot about these two there we
70:24 - go now now it's fine
70:26 - um
70:26 - so that's trimming
70:28 - that is uh that is trimming then we have
70:31 - extend
70:33 - extend is basically if you have a
70:35 - polyline and it's doing this and you
70:37 - have another one and it's doing this and
70:40 - you want this polyline to
70:43 - elongate until it hits
70:45 - this power line right or this line
70:47 - segment elongate until it hits this line
70:49 - segment that is extend
70:52 - ex
70:53 - enter
70:55 - it's going to ask us to either select
70:58 - objects or select all this time around i
71:00 - always select the objects and these are
71:02 - the objects
71:04 - towards which i'm going to extend right
71:07 - so first i then select this line segment
71:11 - right
71:12 - i hit enter
71:15 - and that's important and then i can
71:17 - click
71:18 - on my other line segment and it's going
71:21 - to be extended towards this object right
71:23 - so that's how extend works um
71:26 - there are some cases where it's of
71:28 - course not going to work for instance if
71:30 - i just say line
71:32 - and i want to and i have this line and i
71:35 - want this line segment
71:37 - to extend towards this one it won't work
71:40 - right if i extend
71:42 - enter select this line segment enter
71:45 - and then try to select this line it will
71:48 - not work it will not extend that's
71:49 - because
71:51 - the
71:52 - there's no way for this line to extend
71:54 - so that it hits this line segment
71:57 - uh which actually
71:59 - brings us to
72:00 - uh
72:02 - let's see if it brings us to yes it does
72:04 - it brings us to another tool that's
72:06 - called fillet and the shortcut for it is
72:08 - f
72:09 - f
72:10 - enter
72:11 - fill it
72:12 - right uh so fillet
72:15 - basically extends two line segments
72:17 - until they
72:19 - meet
72:20 - at a corner right
72:22 - let's see this guy and this guy if i
72:24 - fled them
72:26 - you
72:27 - and you
72:29 - they get filleted into a corner
72:32 - the reason why it's called fillet is
72:34 - because you can change the radius of the
72:37 - corner right so it doesn't need to be a
72:39 - sharp corner let me ctrl z to undo
72:42 - and let me fill it again
72:44 - fill it
72:45 - or
72:46 - i write the full thing f enter
72:51 - and here i'll just say
72:53 - radius i'll click on the radius or type
72:56 - in r enter it doesn't matter if you
72:58 - click on or type in r
73:01 - and here i can specify a radius so i'll
73:04 - give it like 500
73:06 - millimeters i have no idea how long
73:08 - those slides are but i i assume 500
73:10 - millimeters will work
73:12 - 100 hit enter
73:14 - and now i will
73:16 - click
73:17 - on the top line
73:18 - click on the bottom line
73:21 - and you get filleted
73:24 - quite nice huh
73:25 - quite nice
73:28 - and it gives us a fillet of
73:31 - radius of 500 millimeters
73:33 - so that's how fillet works
73:36 - um there's also like options for
73:39 - uh fillet where we can see that
73:43 - now there's no options for fillet where
73:44 - we can
73:48 - never mind nevermind
73:50 - ignore ignore what i said uh i thought
73:53 - that it was the same as in rhino but
73:54 - it's not so
73:56 - just radius for now we will just be
73:59 - using radius delete that so let's fill
74:01 - it
74:04 - the left doesn't work
74:06 - with
74:08 - objects
74:10 - that are
74:13 - of parallel
74:14 - because there's no way for you to extend
74:17 - to objects that are parallel to lines
74:19 - that are pale
74:23 - okay
74:29 - okay apparently it does work
74:32 - what the hell okay wait fill that
74:35 - the let radius zero whatever it is is
74:38 - zero will it not work then it still
74:41 - works that's a smart cookie so then if
74:44 - you have two objects that are parallel
74:46 - and you try to fill it them even if the
74:48 - radius you specify the radius to be zero
74:51 - it's going to create an arc that
74:53 - connects the two objects that's nice
74:55 - that's a that's a new functionality of
74:58 - autocad that wasn't there before
75:00 - definitely wasn't there before let's see
75:02 - it in the older version of autocad if
75:04 - that's also the case
75:06 - well older version 2019 is not that old
75:10 - uh one line segment another line segment
75:13 - the let
75:17 - come on fill it
75:19 - let
75:20 - from here
75:22 - here yeah it does work here as well cool
75:25 - okay
75:27 - i'm learning something new as well
75:30 - so if you have two parallel line
75:31 - segments apparently it's going to just
75:33 - create an arc between them with the
75:35 - fillette
75:36 - even if you say you don't want any
75:39 - radius for the fillet to have
75:42 - cool
75:43 - uh what's next next up we have
75:47 - zoom extent okay so that's an important
75:50 - one
75:51 - um wait oh wrong wrong wrong autocad
75:55 - let's say here
75:56 - right i i've been working on this and i
75:59 - have
76:00 - zoomed out
76:04 - zoomed out and i must mess it up and i
76:06 - have no idea where i am right i have
76:09 - absolutely no idea what i where i am
76:12 - uh so what you can do
76:15 - is you can say ctrl a
76:18 - to select all
76:19 - so ctrl a
76:21 - selects
76:23 - everything
76:24 - that you have in your drawing
76:26 - and then what you can do is you can type
76:28 - in z enter
76:30 - [Music]
76:31 - e
76:32 - enter
76:35 - and it's going to zoom in to the
76:37 - geometry that you have selected so
76:40 - if you're lost in your drawing then ctrl
76:43 - a z enter e enter really helps but also
76:47 - it's quite useful where
76:49 - when you have like multiple drawings on
76:51 - one one sheet then just
76:54 - saying well let me
76:56 - copy
76:58 - bam
77:00 - um fade bam bam let's say you have
77:04 - multiple drawings on one sheet and just
77:06 - so that you don't need to zoom in zoom
77:08 - out
77:09 - uh what you can do is you can just
77:11 - select z enter e enter oh sorry in this
77:16 - case it would be z enter
77:18 - s enter
77:19 - selected
77:26 - oh enter
77:31 - i'm a little bit rusty apparently
77:34 - yes okay so it's going to be selecting
77:37 - the object
77:39 - z enter o enter
77:41 - [Music]
77:43 - zoom to object so zoom extends
77:46 - i made a mistake during this tutorial
77:48 - zoom extents you don't need to do
77:50 - control a you don't need to select all
77:52 - of the geometry it already recognizes
77:54 - where that the geometry is as if it's
77:56 - selected so z enter e enter extends will
78:01 - zoom into all of the uh geometries on
78:04 - your scene in your in your model
78:08 - model file automatically you don't need
78:10 - to select all of them beforehand
78:12 - that's useful
78:14 - uh yeah forgot about that one i
78:16 - apologize
78:18 - the entry enter there we go we're zoomed
78:21 - in
78:22 - uh so that's that
78:24 - zoom extents quite useful
78:27 - and then we have array and hatch
78:36 - these two i will show you later
78:39 - once we have some geometry going on in
78:42 - the rhino
78:44 - this is an autocad course in the autocad
78:47 - file
78:48 - once you have some proper geometry going
78:50 - on
78:51 - then i'll show those two
78:53 - then
78:54 - um
78:55 - let's draw a building enough of this
78:58 - let's let's draw let's draw a plan
79:01 - first right
79:02 - so i will
79:05 - i'll keep this why not i'll keep this
79:08 - but here i'll start drawing my my
79:10 - building
79:11 - right so the first thing that you do
79:14 - before you or actually no i will not
79:16 - keep this i will
79:18 - close this file all together or we can
79:22 - we can just select it delete
79:25 - there we go select the deleted
79:27 - clean clean sheet you know to start with
79:31 - the first thing that you do
79:33 - before you start drawing is you check
79:35 - the units we already did that right we
79:37 - are drawing in millimeters
79:39 - second thing that you do when you before
79:41 - you start drawing is you create layers
79:44 - in which you're going to be drawing it
79:47 - so up till now we will we were drawing
79:50 - in a single layer
79:52 - right which was
79:54 - the layer zero
79:57 - autocad works in layers
79:59 - and different
80:01 - line thicknesses different line types
80:04 - and line colors are described by
80:06 - different layers right and you can turn
80:09 - on and off
80:10 - those layers it works in a similar way
80:12 - as as photoshop actually
80:15 - in this regard one more thing that i
80:17 - didn't notice that autocad is vector
80:20 - based rather than raster based so think
80:22 - of it as
80:23 - photoshop versus illustrator right
80:25 - you're used to those too by now
80:28 - photoshop uses pixels
80:31 - while illustrator does it meaning that
80:33 - you can zoom into geometry of
80:36 - illustrator infinitely and it's not
80:38 - going to change resolution or it's not
80:40 - going to
80:41 - it doesn't have a finite resolution
80:44 - while um
80:47 - while in photoshop if you zoom in too
80:49 - close then you'll start seeing the
80:50 - pixels right so any kind of 3d modeling
80:53 - or drawing software
80:55 - for for commercial use is going to be
80:57 - vector based it means that your lines
81:00 - are
81:02 - infinite in in their resolution in their
81:05 - quality
81:06 - uh that's important to
81:08 - know
81:10 - okay layers right so how do we access
81:13 - layers well they are located right here
81:15 - the layers tab of course and you can see
81:18 - here it's it's our active layer layer 0.
81:21 - and if i expand this that's the only
81:23 - layer that we have layer 0 and it says
81:25 - it says that it's white but it's
81:27 - actually black well it shows white
81:29 - because we have a black background but
81:32 - it's going to print out black
81:35 - don't ask why
81:37 - just go with it i'll explain the print
81:41 - printing settings layer
81:46 - if you want to add more layers we need
81:48 - to go to layer properties
81:50 - so i'll click on that layer properties
81:52 - will open up this layer tab for
81:54 - us which
81:57 - let me expand it
81:58 - and let me just make sure that you see
82:00 - it there we go so here we have these
82:03 - four icons create new layer freeze oh
82:07 - wait new layer frozen oh create a new
82:10 - layer that's frozen uh delete layer and
82:14 - set
82:14 - set layer to current we don't care about
82:17 - these three we only care about creating
82:19 - new layers so i'm going to be doing that
82:21 - i'll click on this create new layer tab
82:24 - i'll choose
82:25 - and i'll say
82:28 - thick
82:30 - line
82:30 - or or just thick
82:33 - right so creating new layer calling it
82:35 - thick
82:36 - create one more layer
82:38 - call it medium
82:40 - and create one more layer call it thin
82:44 - right so we have these three layers here
82:47 - thick medium thin
82:49 - great
82:51 - what can you do with them you can turn
82:53 - them on or off
82:55 - you can freeze them and you can lock
82:57 - them
82:59 - for now just
83:01 - ignore the freeze area just
83:04 - think of it this way if you lock them
83:07 - you can't select the geometry
83:10 - of that particular layer in the viewport
83:12 - which is quite useful when you have a
83:14 - lot of stuff layered on top of each
83:16 - other uh stuff that you don't want to
83:18 - select
83:19 - can be
83:20 - locked which is
83:22 - nice
83:24 - then are those layers
83:26 - printable can you print so that's the
83:29 - plot area here
83:31 - what kind of color do those layers have
83:34 - what kind of what's the display color
83:36 - and what kind of line type and line
83:38 - weight
83:39 - so we will be changing that in just uh
83:42 - i guess in the next tutorial
83:44 - but for now i'll just change the colors
83:47 - just so that we can distinguish between
83:48 - thick medium and thin right so the thick
83:51 - layer i always like to
83:54 - choose red from here
83:59 - medium i always like to use blue
84:04 - and thin i always like to use green
84:10 - but it's absolutely up to you this is
84:12 - just something that i'm used to
84:14 - and as i'm drawing this is the way i
84:17 - color code my lines
84:19 - that's about it
84:21 - right so we have our layers set up and
84:23 - i'll keep the zero layer for now that's
84:25 - that's fine that's okay
84:28 - once we have them set up i can close
84:32 - and now i can uh create or not not
84:35 - create but i now i can expand this um
84:39 - drop-down list of layers and i can
84:41 - choose which one is going to be my
84:43 - active one the one in which i draw so
84:45 - i'll choose thick layer here
84:48 - thick it's my active one and now as i
84:50 - draw a circle for instance it's going to
84:52 - be red because it lives in that layer
84:56 - if i draw another one it's also red red
84:58 - right all of them are red
85:00 - um
85:01 - if i want to change a layer of an object
85:04 - all i need to do or multiple objects all
85:07 - i need to do is just select them
85:10 - and in the drop down list i just choose
85:13 - the layer
85:14 - right
85:15 - once i hit escape
85:18 - i'm back to my
85:21 - to the active layer in which i'm drawing
85:23 - but now the layers of these two objects
85:26 - have been changed and i can see that it
85:29 - blue might not go well with the
85:31 - recording so i will go to layer
85:34 - properties and change this blue to cn
85:39 - right to cyan not c and cyan
85:42 - uh just so that they pop a little bit
85:44 - better
85:46 - there we go so that is that's that
85:48 - right uh working with layers really easy
85:52 - in autocad let's start drawing so i'm
85:55 - gonna start drawing in thick layer uh
85:58 - with thick lines because i'm going to be
85:59 - drawing a plan and i'm going to be
86:02 - i'll start drawing from the walls right
86:05 - or rather from the section of the walls
86:08 - so
86:09 - the plan
86:10 - is cut
86:12 - at 1.2 meters
86:15 - yeah it's cut at 1.2 meters so that you
86:18 - are cutting through windows above the
86:20 - tables and whatnot so it's like a locked
86:24 - locked number um you can always kind of
86:26 - adjust the the height
86:29 - you know
86:30 - for different projects if there's a need
86:32 - for that but the default
86:34 - you know the default number that you
86:36 - should have in your head is 1.2 meters
86:39 - uh so that's how high we're going going
86:42 - to be cutting our our plan
86:46 - or our building and showing the plan uh
86:48 - through the cut so
86:50 - if we go into the course website and
86:54 - kind of read through this
86:56 - i can somewhere here
86:59 - that's the course description that's the
87:01 - deliverables
87:02 - yeah there we go uh no matter which
87:04 - client is chosen the building footprint
87:06 - cannot exceed 25 square meters okay
87:09 - that's like five by five sure but five
87:11 - by five is is not that convenient for me
87:15 - i'm thinking of a six by four perhaps
87:23 - yeah sure let's do six by four uh we'll
87:26 - we'll see how we can cram it in i
87:28 - haven't planned it out in my head so it
87:30 - might be a very crappy
87:33 - very crappy building but this is just to
87:35 - showcase uh
87:38 - the way you work in autocad
87:41 - um
87:42 - right so
87:43 - i need a
87:45 - i'm going to have a building that has a
87:46 - footprint of six by four meters six
87:49 - thousand by four thousand millimeters so
87:51 - i'm going to actually create a rectangle
87:53 - r e c t rect
87:55 - i'll start drawing it from anywhere
87:57 - doesn't matter and i will say that i'm
88:00 - going to draw it in dimensions rather
88:02 - than just clicking somewhere else on the
88:04 - screen so d enter
88:06 - right the enter and then i type in the
88:09 - length which is 6000 enter
88:12 - um
88:14 - did i not yes six thousand and now it
88:17 - asks me for the width and the width is
88:19 - going to be
88:20 - four thousand
88:22 - actually i can kind of get away with 4
88:25 - 200 but for now i'll just say 24 square
88:28 - meters that's fine as well
88:29 - 4 000.
88:31 - so and then i'll just choose that yeah
88:33 - here whatever
88:35 - there's the rectangle there
88:37 - um so that's my that's my outer
88:41 - footprint right outer footprint my walls
88:44 - have thickness of course and for this i
88:46 - will say that the wall thickness is
88:48 - going to be
88:50 - um
88:51 - 400 millimeters the outer wall thickness
88:55 - around 400 millimeters
88:57 - usually they are a little bit thicker
88:59 - than that but
89:01 - uh it's a summer house it's a pretty
89:03 - small house so 400 is okay
89:06 - uh so what i want to do
89:08 - is actually i want this rectangle to go
89:11 - inwards
89:12 - to make a copy of this rectangle inwards
89:15 - by
89:16 - 400 millimeters and there's a tool that
89:19 - does that i will show it on the side
89:21 - here real quickly if i have a polyline
89:24 - or a line segment
89:26 - and i use a tool that's called offset
89:29 - offset
89:30 - oh i think it's
89:32 - yeah it's just o enter
89:35 - and i type in the distance so here i'll
89:38 - just type in 400 enter
89:41 - then i can select the line segment here
89:45 - and i can offset it to either side to
89:47 - here or here this mirror
89:49 - and click
89:50 - and then i know that between these two
89:52 - lines the gap is indeed
89:54 - 400 millimeters right so that's offset
89:58 - really useful
90:00 - uh
90:01 - also works with polylines
90:04 - offset
90:06 - uh 400
90:08 - like that right
90:10 - if i were to draw the same shape or
90:12 - similar shape
90:13 - with line segments though
90:16 - like that and then i did offset
90:21 - keyboard come on
90:24 - offset 400
90:26 - then
90:27 - since i drew this with polyline and this
90:30 - with line tool this is exploded so that
90:33 - means that my offset is going to be a
90:35 - little bit more tricky
90:38 - like that
90:39 - right i will need to offset every line
90:41 - separately and then i will need to tr
90:44 - trim enter enter and trim away the
90:47 - doodads here
90:48 - right
90:50 - clean it up
90:53 - now they're kind of the same the only
90:55 - difference is that this is exploded
90:57 - while this is joined up right
91:00 - so back here back to our plan i can just
91:03 - do offset
91:07 - 400
91:08 - and offset it inwards by 400 inwards
91:12 - because
91:13 - we are already at at 25 square meters
91:18 - or 24 square meters so i can't offset it
91:21 - outwards i need to opposite it inwards
91:23 - right
91:25 - so that's the
91:26 - the thing that we are going to be
91:28 - working with right that's our
91:33 - inner area
91:35 - not a lot of stuff
91:38 - to work on
91:40 - so let me just quickly plan this out
91:45 - let's see we have
91:50 - some sort of a block here
91:54 - toilet shower room
91:57 - entrance
92:03 - and the work
92:05 - okay
92:07 - so
92:08 - let's say i want a separate room here
92:12 - right in this area
92:14 - where i'm going to have my
92:17 - bathroom my shower and
92:19 - and whatnot in in in this particular
92:21 - room
92:22 - right
92:23 - um and it's going to be a little bit of
92:26 - an awkward room but that's going to work
92:28 - out so
92:29 - i am going to create a line segment
92:33 - right and i'll just
92:36 - kind of draw it out from this corner
92:39 - point
92:41 - to this corner point like so and hit
92:44 - enter right so now what i have here is i
92:47 - have a duplicate line right
92:51 - there is this polyline here and also
92:53 - this line segment
92:55 - the reason why i do this is because now
92:57 - i can take this line segment i can
92:59 - select it if you have problem selecting
93:01 - it you can always use the blue
93:05 - marking tool
93:06 - and just select it that way
93:08 - um and i can type in offset
93:14 - and let's say
93:19 - how wide
93:20 - how wide so the
93:23 - smallest shower
93:25 - that that is kind of nice still nice to
93:28 - have
93:29 - is around 900 millimeters so we can't
93:32 - have it thinner like than that so i will
93:35 - say 900
93:38 - millimeters
93:43 - such a
93:45 - bad
93:47 - bad space
93:48 - though
93:51 - such a bad space okay let's do instead
93:53 - of 900 i will do
93:56 - one meter at least yeah one meter it
93:59 - creates an offset right and now for this
94:02 - line so this is going to be
94:04 - like a mark where my bathroom ends
94:08 - so i want to make this into a wall so i
94:11 - will offset it again i click on it and
94:13 - i'll type in
94:17 - 140 millimeters
94:20 - 14 centimeters that's enough for the
94:22 - inner walls
94:24 - right
94:26 - 14 millimeters
94:28 - and once i'm done
94:29 - i just hit escape or enter doesn't
94:31 - matter
94:33 - and i have my
94:34 - my two line segments that describe an
94:38 - inner wall right here
94:41 - i still do have that line segment here
94:43 - that i use right but i don't need it
94:45 - anymore so i'll just select it and hit
94:48 - delete
94:49 - just get rid of it all together
94:52 - right
94:53 - so that's my two line segments
94:56 - now what i want is i want
94:59 - to get rid of this
95:01 - segment here
95:03 - and this segment here so that is trim
95:06 - right tr enter
95:08 - enter
95:09 - and then click
95:12 - click enter
95:15 - easy
95:16 - right i've
95:18 - just successfully
95:20 - uh deleted those two segments and now i
95:22 - have a room here and a room here i don't
95:25 - have any doors or windows or anything
95:27 - but i do have a room that's one meter
95:30 - here and all of the remaining area is
95:33 - located here
95:35 - this is not clean anymore because
95:38 - this pole line and this line segment are
95:41 - two separate entities i want to join
95:43 - everything up
95:44 - so that this is a rectangle this is a
95:46 - rectangle and this is a rectangle so
95:48 - that i have three rectangles here so
95:50 - i'll select all of it and type in join
95:53 - hit enter
95:55 - and yeah that that's it just join them
95:58 - up right so now this is a rectangle
96:00 - rectangle rectangle closed
96:03 - very important that they are closed
96:06 - so that is that
96:07 - uh let's create an entrance doorway
96:11 - right or
96:13 - let's create a doorway into
96:17 - into the bathroom right so i'm going to
96:19 - create a line segment
96:22 - just from here to here from the midpoint
96:24 - to the midpoint because i want the door
96:25 - to be
96:26 - centered
96:28 - and the door is 90 centimeters so so the
96:31 - the width of the door is 90 centimeters
96:34 - the height of the door is usually two
96:36 - point in between 2.1 meters and 2.2
96:39 - uh
96:40 - depends
96:41 - on on what kind of door you're using but
96:43 - usually
96:44 - uh
96:45 - what i like to do is do 2.2 meter high
96:48 - doors and add
96:51 - if i need to then i add framing inside
96:53 - so it kind of eats up a little bit a
96:55 - little bit of that height either way we
96:58 - have the line segment
96:59 - i will offset it
97:03 - um i'll specify the offset distance to b
97:07 - because i want to offset it to
97:09 - both sides it will be 45 centimeters so
97:12 - 450 millimeters hit enter
97:16 - and now i can just
97:18 - offset it up
97:20 - and offset it down like that right
97:23 - stay with me
97:24 - i hit enter
97:26 - now i don't need the middle segment
97:28 - anymore so i can just select it delete
97:30 - it
97:32 - right
97:32 - and i have these two segments now so
97:35 - i'll say trim
97:37 - enter
97:39 - i'll just trim away
97:41 - this oops
97:42 - trim
97:44 - enter enter
97:46 - always forget to do the double enter
97:49 - and i'll just trim away these two line
97:51 - segments here
97:53 - right
97:53 - so now what i've done is i created an
97:56 - opening
97:57 - in the wall right for for the door to be
98:00 - in
98:01 - i can select all of this type in join
98:06 - and now all of all of these segments are
98:08 - joined so i have one polyline here
98:11 - and one polyline here
98:13 - great
98:14 - let's do this again i will keep doing
98:16 - this just so that you can follow along
98:19 - quite quite easily so i want a door here
98:23 - right
98:24 - and i probably want so if there's a
98:27 - shower here i do want to have a window
98:33 - and there's a toilet here i do want to
98:35 - have a window here right
98:37 - um right so door window
98:40 - okay i will create a line segment from
98:43 - here to here
98:45 - and i will offset it
98:48 - by 900 millimeters to the side like so
98:54 - trim
98:56 - enter
98:57 - enter enter rather
99:00 - and then the same thing here
99:02 - um actually
99:04 - this one can be the the same size as the
99:06 - door
99:08 - so i'll just kind of
99:10 - be cheeky about it and just start
99:12 - drawing from
99:14 - from the doorway like so
99:17 - trim
99:19 - enter enter
99:21 - tr not trim god damn it i keep
99:23 - forgetting tr
99:25 - for trimming and i create an opening
99:27 - here
99:28 - so door door window and it's probably
99:32 - going to have a window somewhere here
99:33 - but we'll kind of take care of that side
99:36 - layer
99:38 - okay
99:39 - the thing is well first of all let's
99:41 - let's clean everything up by selecting
99:44 - the walls and joining them up
99:47 - just so that this is closed and this is
99:49 - closed right so everything is kind of
99:51 - neat and dandy
99:54 - the thing is that here
99:57 - while
99:58 - we are cutting through
100:00 - the doorway here we don't see the bottom
100:03 - of the doorway all we see is just kind
100:05 - of floor floor floor floor but here the
100:08 - window probably will not reach the floor
100:11 - right
100:12 - so that means that we will see the
100:14 - window sill right we will see the bottom
100:17 - of the window opening in the plan
100:20 - and i can uh not can i need to show it
100:24 - right so i'm going to go to
100:27 - the layers and i'll say that
100:30 - the layer in which i'm going to draw is
100:32 - the medium layer so let let's talk about
100:34 - this just a second
100:36 - thick
100:37 - layer is used to specify all of the
100:40 - lines which you get
100:42 - from
100:43 - cutting something right so i'm cutting
100:46 - the walls
100:47 - right and i'm looking at the cut of the
100:49 - walls
100:50 - meaning that they will be shown thick in
100:53 - the thick line
100:54 - medium line is stuff that you
100:58 - see as a projection right so you're not
101:00 - cutting through it but you can still see
101:01 - it so in this case uh if i have a
101:07 - if i have a window
101:15 - oh my god wait just bear with me
101:19 - sure that's that's fine
101:22 - so let's say i have a window um
101:25 - you know that that has some sort of
101:27 - partition
101:29 - partitioning whatever
101:31 - is just a window right in in the in the
101:34 - facade
101:35 - and i am cutting through that window
101:40 - like so
101:42 - right at this height i'm cutting through
101:44 - it and i'm looking at it
101:48 - downwards i'm looking at the cut
101:51 - you know straight downwards
101:53 - that means that i i will see the frame i
101:56 - will be cutting through the frame i will
101:58 - be cutting through the glass
102:00 - frame again and then wall right so wall
102:03 - frame glass
102:05 - frame wall but also i will be seeing
102:09 - the hole
102:11 - here right i will be seeing the the
102:13 - windowsill
102:15 - so
102:16 - that windowsill is not a cut rather it's
102:19 - just a projection it's just something
102:21 - that i see
102:22 - meaning that i
102:24 - use a medium line
102:26 - grab a line tool and i just draw it from
102:29 - here
102:30 - to here
102:32 - enter or either let's just draw a
102:34 - rectangle instead
102:36 - might as well polyline tool
102:38 - like that that
102:40 - that
102:41 - that that
102:43 - that's the windowsill right
102:45 - and i still i still have the red lines
102:49 - um
102:52 - above it i guess like the cut above it
102:55 - it's just that visually
102:56 - autocad needs to choose which kind of uh
103:00 - geometry to show
103:02 - uh
103:02 - if there's like two geometries on top of
103:04 - each other so you just choose to show
103:06 - the medium one but we don't care because
103:08 - we know that we have the thick line
103:09 - above it
103:10 - and my camera died
103:14 - just a second
103:15 - god damn it
103:20 - yeah yeah yeah
103:30 - you're good
103:31 - all right
103:32 - we're good okay
103:35 - so that's the window windowsill right
103:37 - now for the frame
103:40 - uh we'll do the frames in the next
103:41 - tutorial um
103:43 - for the doors as well right
103:45 - uh as long as we have the windows so
103:46 - it's fine one more thing is we have the
103:49 - floor slab right and then we have the
103:52 - outside you know the ground the gravel
103:55 - and so on those are
103:56 - things that are in two different heights
103:59 - and two different levels right because
104:00 - usually you have like a step or two
104:02 - steps near the entrance and blah blah
104:06 - which means that
104:08 - there's a a line where the floor slab
104:11 - ends right where where the floor just
104:14 - ends we need to mark that line so i'll
104:17 - use the line tool and just mark it here
104:20 - that's where my floor slab ends
104:24 - right
104:25 - so we have that going on now
104:27 - nice
104:28 - um
104:30 - we will be adding doors here the next
104:32 - tutorial a toilet
104:36 - shower
104:41 - it's a little bit
104:44 - it's going to be a little bit tricky to
104:46 - plan out but i we'll we'll figure it out
104:48 - we will figure it out for now um
104:52 - this is all that you need to do
104:56 - practice
104:57 - practice the lines practice the tools
104:59 - and so on and draw out the
105:03 - just the walls
105:04 - with
105:05 - the openings shown right properly
105:08 - so this is that one
105:11 - this is the level of detail that
105:14 - that you should have
105:16 - after the first day of tutorials
105:20 - next up i will not need to show you
105:23 - every tool
105:24 - uh so we will
105:27 - make a lot of more progress in terms of
105:31 - of drawing in the next tutorial
105:33 - for now
105:35 - get to work
105:36 - and have fun
105:38 - bye
105:41 - all right hello
105:42 - hello and this is going to be the second
105:45 - part of our tutorial series for router
105:48 - cat
105:49 - where i'm going to
105:51 - kind of continue on working on the plan
105:53 - and hopefully we'll move
105:55 - more forward with the section and so on
105:57 - so in the first part i've already showed
106:00 - you most of the
106:01 - most of the tools that we're going to
106:03 - use
106:05 - so here it's just designing right it's
106:07 - it's just adding geometry into our plan
106:11 - so let me
106:16 - let me keep the camera there that's fine
106:19 - should be okay
106:20 - okay
106:21 - so we finished off by creating openings
106:25 - here for the window for the doors and
106:27 - whatnot and creating a little
106:30 - room for our sink to be in
106:34 - well it's probably going to be somewhere
106:35 - here the shower
106:38 - and the toilet
106:42 - show
106:43 - let's continue
106:45 - so the
106:46 - the thing that i want to do is probably
106:48 - add the
106:50 - a little bit more detail into the window
106:52 - a little bit more detailing to the doors
106:53 - and and whatnot and then continue on
106:55 - working with this area right here
106:59 - so first of all i'm going to create a
107:01 - window so remember where i showed you
107:04 - before if you have a window
107:07 - like that
107:08 - and i'll just draw it in
107:11 - in lines without any thicknesses
107:14 - let's say you have you know a regular
107:16 - window in a facade
107:18 - and it's in the hole in the wall right
107:21 - and you're cutting through it like so
107:26 - so
107:27 - [Music]
107:30 - and you're looking down
107:32 - on it
107:36 - right you're looking downwards through
107:38 - the cut you're cutting through the wall
107:41 - right here
107:43 - and right here
107:45 - you're cutting through the wall you're
107:47 - cutting through the glass and you're
107:48 - cutting through the frames of the window
107:50 - so if you have divisions
107:52 - you would be cutting through the middle
107:54 - frame as well but i think for a window
107:56 - this size we don't need any divisions
107:58 - it's just going to be
108:03 - is lagging
108:07 - let's do
108:11 - it's just going to be this kind of
108:13 - window
108:14 - so we're going to cut through the frame
108:15 - here through the glass here through the
108:17 - frame here right let's do that a window
108:21 - frame what i prefer to use is
108:24 - five by five centimeters right it's not
108:27 - accurate but that is enough for our
108:29 - level of detail that we're going to be
108:31 - using
108:32 - so
108:33 - since we're cutting through the frame
108:36 - i'm going to be using a thick line right
108:39 - and i'm actually going to just draw the
108:43 - the cut of a frame anywhere on on the
108:46 - screen doesn't matter click apollo line
108:48 - tool
108:50 - just hit that f8 button or ortho or two
108:53 - snapping on
108:56 - so that it's horizontal or vertical and
108:58 - i'll just give it 50 enter to the side
109:01 - 50 enter
109:03 - side 50 enter
109:06 - there we go
109:07 - something like that
109:08 - so
109:09 - you could do a rectangle but i just i
109:12 - don't know i'm used to drawing it in
109:14 - polyline
109:16 - now
109:17 - we need to take this frame and place it
109:20 - in the middle
109:22 - of this opening here right
109:24 - on this side and on this side
109:27 - so i'm gonna take the frame
109:29 - i'm going to move it m
109:31 - enter
109:33 - and i'm going to move it from its let's
109:35 - say top middle point here
109:39 - all the way out to
109:41 - the middle point right here
109:44 - right here there we go
109:46 - click
109:47 - now it's here
109:49 - then i just take it i copy it
109:56 - by by using the command copy for some
109:58 - reason it's not
110:00 - making a copy i don't know why let's try
110:02 - again copy
110:05 - from here
110:07 - to here
110:09 - there we go
110:10 - now we have a cut through the frame
110:12 - right
110:13 - so
110:14 - this area right here
110:17 - is done
110:19 - and this area right here is done
110:22 - now we will be cutting through the
110:24 - window as well through the glass sorry
110:27 - as as well and for the glass since it's
110:30 - uh
110:32 - this is just graphics but i prefer to do
110:34 - it this way since we are indeed cutting
110:37 - through the glass you would think that
110:38 - we will be using a thick line
110:41 - but
110:41 - since
110:42 - glass is inherently transparent i prefer
110:46 - to use a medium line thickness for it
110:49 - just so that it's not too thick right
110:53 - um
110:54 - so let me jump to the medium layer
110:57 - and just draw a line
110:59 - from the midpoint here
111:02 - to the midpoint here so that is our
111:05 - glass in the window
111:08 - the thing is
111:09 - that if
111:10 - you think about it
111:12 - we are cutting indeed cutting through
111:14 - the glass
111:15 - but we are also seeing the bottom of the
111:17 - frame right here right this this edge
111:21 - right here will be seen
111:23 - right which means that here we need two
111:26 - more lines to show the bottom of the
111:28 - frame
111:29 - and for those two lines
111:32 - uh since i'm using a medium line to show
111:34 - the cut through the glass
111:36 - i will be showing those two lines that
111:40 - we actually see at the bottom of the
111:41 - window
111:43 - uh as
111:44 - a thin line right i will represent it
111:47 - with a thin line
111:48 - the reason why i'm doing this
111:50 - uh the reason why i'm doing this is
111:52 - because
111:53 - once we print it out
111:56 - or plot it out as a pdf
111:59 - and we have it zoomed out i don't want
112:01 - these three lines to merge into one
112:04 - thick one right
112:06 - or just just because we are so zoomed
112:08 - out and the thicknesses eat each other
112:10 - up right so i have them
112:13 - separated
112:14 - into two thin lines and one medium line
112:18 - rather than thick and two medium lines
112:21 - which would be a little bit more
112:23 - accurate but wouldn't represent the
112:25 - window that well
112:27 - that's basically it we we have a window
112:29 - now right we have the glass the bottom
112:33 - of the frame
112:34 - and the cut through the frame
112:36 - right here
112:38 - okay window is done
112:40 - now the door
112:41 - [Music]
112:43 - perhaps we should use
112:45 - where where do we on which door do we
112:47 - start working on
112:50 - let's work on this one right
112:53 - so the door is
112:54 - it's basically drawn um i can show you
112:57 - somewhere here
112:59 - the door is basically just drawn
113:02 - as
113:03 - always being opened
113:05 - unless it's a
113:07 - re
113:09 - reconstruction project and you already
113:11 - have existing doors in the previous
113:13 - project which you reconstruct then those
113:15 - doors are usually shown half opened
113:18 - at 45 degree angle but in this case
113:21 - since these are new doors we are going
113:22 - to be showing them at
113:25 - completely opened at 90 degrees
113:27 - angle from the
113:30 - from the wall
113:32 - and they will
113:33 - incorporate a door swing like so right
113:37 - well not like so actually
113:40 - i'm going to make this quite fast
113:50 - like that
113:51 - so it's going to be
113:54 - the door swing showing the travel of the
113:57 - door when you open it up
113:59 - as well as the door itself being open
114:02 - the door is shown in a neckline because
114:05 - you're cutting through the door
114:07 - and the opening
114:09 - of the door is shown in the thin line
114:11 - because it's a non-existing
114:14 - geometry right it's it's something that
114:16 - you just use as a markup to show the
114:19 - travel so you don't even need to have a
114:22 - medium line for that it needs to be a
114:24 - thin line
114:26 - so that kind of doorway needs to be here
114:28 - needs to be incorporated here so the way
114:30 - i i really like doing it
114:33 - is
114:34 - by creating a line line two
114:36 - here
114:38 - um
114:39 - do we do it that way
114:42 - maybe we want a little bit of an offset
114:44 - okay let's first do a little bit of an
114:45 - offset so i will create a line or or
114:48 - rather two lines
114:51 - from here to here
114:52 - and from here to here
114:54 - these two line segments and i will give
114:56 - them a little bit of an offset uh five
114:59 - centimeters at most we can do even less
115:02 - we can do two centimeters it's up to you
115:04 - but i prefer using five so five
115:07 - centimeters enter
115:09 - i'll just offset
115:11 - that line inwards like so by five
115:13 - centimeters and that line inwards like
115:15 - so also 50 millimeters five centimeters
115:19 - so now we have um
115:23 - these two
115:24 - floating lines here and these two
115:26 - guidelines that we first had i don't
115:28 - need them anymore so i can delete them
115:31 - so
115:32 - so this is a bracket in which our door
115:35 - is going to be held
115:37 - and treat these two lines as your helper
115:40 - helper lines
115:41 - right we will be deleting them later on
115:45 - so now what i do is i create
115:48 - a straight line segment in a thick layer
115:52 - from the midpoint here
115:54 - to the midpoint here
115:56 - like that
115:58 - right
115:59 - i select it and now i want to open up
116:01 - the door right so uh this doorway
116:04 - or this door
116:06 - board i want to rotate it right so i'm
116:09 - going to use a tool that's called rotate
116:12 - rotate enter
116:14 - it's going to ask me to for a point
116:16 - around which i'm going to be rotating so
116:19 - let's say the door
116:21 - hinge is right here
116:22 - that point
116:24 - and basically then i can
116:26 - just
116:28 - either move it like so move the mouse
116:31 - like so and click or i can type in
116:34 - 90 degrees
116:36 - and hit enter well
116:38 - not 90 sorry
116:39 - minus 90.
116:41 - so apparently
116:43 - if if you add positive values it's going
116:47 - to rotate counterclockwise if you had
116:49 - negative values it's going to rotate no
116:52 - sorry
116:53 - negative values are clockwise positive
116:56 - values are counterclockwise
116:58 - so again rotate select this object
117:02 - enter rotate around here minus 90
117:05 - degrees
117:06 - there we go so now it's it has been
117:09 - opened and now all i need to do is just
117:11 - create that arc right
117:13 - so i can either use
117:15 - a circle tool and trim away stuff
117:19 - from the circle tool or i can just use
117:21 - arc
117:23 - well let me show you it then in both
117:25 - ways so let me do it with the circle
117:28 - tool first i will create a circle
117:31 - from here
117:33 - to here from the midpoint here to the
117:35 - end of the door here
117:37 - i will create one more line
117:39 - from midpoint here
117:41 - midpoint here
117:43 - like that
117:45 - and now i will trim
117:48 - enter
117:49 - enter again
117:50 - and i'll just get rid of
117:53 - the unnecessary parts
117:55 - of the circle to just get that
117:58 - arc there and now i can delete
118:01 - all of the necessary stuff and change
118:04 - the arc of of the
118:06 - [Music]
118:07 - the doorway
118:09 - right
118:10 - of the door's wing
118:11 - so that's that um i will show another
118:14 - method of how to create that arc
118:16 - in this version here because we need a
118:18 - doorway here
118:20 - so
118:22 - let me do the same thing first
118:24 - from here to here we have a line segment
118:26 - from here to here we have a line segment
118:28 - i offset them
118:31 - 50 millimeters offset words inwards
118:35 - escape out
118:36 - delete the trash or the helper lines
118:40 - like that create a line segment
118:44 - ma'am something like this
118:47 - rotate
118:50 - that and this time around it's going to
118:52 - be counterclockwise so it's just going
118:54 - to be 90 degrees like that
118:57 - and now what i can do is i can just
119:00 - create an arc let's say arc tool or a
119:04 - enter
119:05 - and i will say that
119:08 - the center point of the arc
119:10 - or rather i will not be using start
119:13 - point
119:14 - of an arc but rather i will be using
119:17 - the center mode or the arc tool so i'll
119:20 - click on that
119:21 - in the bottom
119:23 - which will ask me to give it a center so
119:25 - the center is going to be located right
119:28 - here
119:29 - where the door starts right here
119:32 - and i'm just going to draw an arc from
119:34 - this point
119:36 - to this point
119:37 - that's it that's that's an arc that has
119:39 - been created now we clean up the trash
119:41 - again
119:44 - and change the arc layer to thin
119:47 - that's it so those are two two different
119:50 - methods of how you can
119:51 - actually
119:52 - use the
119:54 - or how you can add the arc
119:58 - sorry about this yeah that's fine
120:01 - okay
120:02 - moving on
120:03 - so we have uh two doorways we have a
120:06 - window perhaps i want a window here as
120:08 - well but first of all i need to plan out
120:11 - how my
120:12 - whole
120:14 - room is going to look like so let's say
120:16 - we enter here we will need some place to
120:18 - put down our codes and we will need some
120:21 - sort of a place for a for a bed and it's
120:25 - just going to be a small bed because we
120:27 - can't have
120:29 - a large bed here
120:31 - so let me just create uh just to see the
120:34 - proportion of the room let me just
120:36 - somewhere else on the screen uh let me
120:39 - just create a size of a bed that that i
120:42 - want and it's going to just be
120:44 - i'm drawing it with polyline 2 100
120:48 - millimeters long
120:50 - um
120:51 - i'll go for
120:53 - one mirror 10
120:55 - 100 millimeters wide
120:58 - 210
121:00 - or 200
121:01 - and close off the pole line so that's my
121:04 - bed and it's going to be in the medium
121:08 - medium layer
121:09 - i'm just going to move it
121:12 - somewhere here and start planning out
121:14 - how how everything is going to be kind
121:16 - of arranged and how everything is going
121:19 - to look like
121:22 - that's not great
121:24 - let's see let's see let's see if we can
121:27 - make it better i'll rotate this
121:30 - from here
121:32 - here
121:32 - there we go
121:35 - reposition this to here that's a little
121:38 - bit better
121:39 - we can have uh
121:42 - a table here but the door is going to be
121:45 - obnoxious
121:46 - that's fine we can we can flip the door
121:48 - around let's see
121:50 - how wide the table is going to be so i
121:53 - can check the distance here i can
121:56 - measure the distance by typing in dist
121:59 - sort for distance
122:01 - enter and clicking on two points so from
122:04 - here
122:05 - to here
122:06 - give me the distance and right next to
122:09 - my cursor or
122:11 - also above my command line well we can't
122:13 - see it anymore there
122:15 - i will see the distance so let me try
122:17 - that again
122:19 - 1960 millimeters 1.9 meters that's a lot
122:23 - that's that's uh that's quite enough
122:26 - for shelving and also the
122:30 - the table
122:31 - so i'm going to do that i'll create a
122:33 - polyline and i will say that my table is
122:39 - let's go for a pretty thin one let's go
122:41 - for 600 millimeters
122:43 - 600 enter
122:46 - until here here
122:48 - here
122:50 - there we go
122:51 - and this block is just going to be
122:53 - representing my
122:55 - my table right
122:57 - so bed table there's gonna be a chair
123:00 - here and then this door
123:02 - is
123:03 - in the way right it's just messing
123:05 - everything up so what i'm going to do is
123:08 - i will mirror this door uh so that it
123:11 - opens up here the way i do that is just
123:13 - i'll create a line
123:15 - in the opening
123:17 - just to have the midpoint of the line
123:20 - i will select the door
123:22 - i'll type in mirror
123:24 - and then i will use the midpoint of that
123:26 - line
123:27 - i'll mirror the door horizontally like
123:30 - so and when it asks me to resource
123:32 - objects i'll actually say yes
123:36 - right so that it deletes the old version
123:39 - that's it now it has been mirrored quite
123:42 - easy
123:44 - um as you can see most of the time i
123:46 - have orthographic snapping turned on for
123:49 - this project
123:50 - um yeah that that is how it is
123:53 - okay
123:54 - so we enter
123:57 - really hate the
124:03 - entrance here though
124:06 - like the flow is really bad
124:10 - i'll solve this later
124:12 - i'll solve this layer
124:15 - i think there's there's there are ways
124:17 - of how to solve this
124:19 - um but for now let's continue
124:22 - so now i need a kitchenette right so
124:26 - kitchen cabinets are always have
124:29 - kitchen cabinets always have the same
124:31 - module size and it's always 60 by 60
124:33 - centimeters so the refrigerator the
124:36 - stove the
124:38 - the sink
124:39 - cabinet all of them have 60 by 60
124:42 - centimeters that's the
124:44 - not regulation but the
124:47 - default value let's see
124:48 - so i'll switch to medium and i'll just
124:51 - create that single rectangle of 600 mil
124:55 - by 600 mil
124:57 - by 600
125:00 - like that
125:02 - that's our
125:04 - single segment for the kitchen
125:06 - and i'm thinking of having the kitchen
125:08 - right here
125:11 - right so that's let's say that's our
125:12 - refrigerator puppy
125:16 - that's going to be our
125:18 - sink our
125:22 - stove
125:24 - and
125:26 - or rather maybe maybe the stove is here
125:30 - the fridge is here the sink is here and
125:33 - the cutting area and
125:35 - food preparation area is here right so
125:38 - we have that
125:40 - that's good enough i think that's good
125:42 - enough and now i can add
125:45 - one more wall right here
125:50 - just just for
125:53 - how do i call it
125:57 - just a separation you know kitchen from
126:00 - the entrance also it will create a
126:02 - little bit of a hallway here
126:04 - just fine
126:06 - um so i will create a polyline
126:09 - i'll just draw out well let's go for
126:11 - thick line i'll draw out a wall but i
126:14 - don't really know how long the wall can
126:16 - be
126:17 - so what i'm going to do is i will create
126:21 - an offset for the bed
126:24 - offset
126:26 - for the bed and i'll give it like 900
126:29 - millimeters
126:30 - like that
126:32 - right so now i know that this gap right
126:35 - here is walkable and it's it's easy to
126:38 - to kind of walk through and
126:40 - um
126:42 - yeah
126:44 - so basically i am able to walk around it
126:46 - so now i know that the longest
126:50 - um wall that i can have is something
126:52 - like this right in the gap between here
126:55 - um i will create a polyline now
126:58 - draw it out like so
127:00 - i'll give it
127:01 - 140 millimeters
127:04 - to the side and finish up here finish it
127:06 - up here
127:08 - and now i don't need the helper line
127:09 - anymore so i can delete it so that is my
127:12 - second partition
127:14 - right here
127:17 - which i think is fine
127:20 - you enter you put down your close you
127:24 - can work you can sleep
127:27 - you can use the stove
127:29 - or you can prepare food
127:31 - and you eat where you work yeah that's
127:34 - fine that's that's reasonable i think
127:37 - um here right here
127:40 - i have a line segment that i don't need
127:43 - in the wall because you know my wall
127:45 - kind of continues on here so i'll just
127:48 - trim it away trim enter enter
127:51 - get rid of that
127:53 - and then i'll join up
127:55 - these two line uh these two separate
127:58 - segments this one and this one i'll just
127:59 - type in join to join them up and make it
128:02 - at a closed
128:04 - uh polar line to to just have it clean
128:08 - okay
128:09 - uh once you enter you want to put down
128:12 - your clothes somewhere so i will create
128:14 - um
128:16 - a little bit of a
128:20 - shelf i guess not not a shell
128:23 - let's just call it close storage right i
128:26 - will create that and it's going to be
128:28 - um let's go for 500 millimeters
128:32 - 500 mil
128:33 - like that
128:35 - i have no idea how long this is so i
128:37 - need to actually before i create that uh
128:41 - that area right there i need to
128:44 - measure distance
128:47 - from here to
128:48 - here 1.2 meters
128:53 - we have 1.2 meters for that
128:56 - uh sure 1.2 by
128:59 - 500 millimeters so 1200 by 500 sure um
129:04 - i'll switch to medium line and i'll just
129:06 - draw it out from here to here 500
129:11 - here to here
129:13 - this is where we put our clothes right
129:17 - um
129:18 - now i really want to solve this because
129:21 - this is kind of obnoxious that you need
129:23 - to close have the door closed of course
129:25 - you most of the time will have the door
129:27 - closed and it's going to work but
129:29 - visually it's not that nice so i am
129:32 - going to
129:36 - probably create a
129:37 - toilet here
129:41 - and see how far i can move this doorway
129:44 - away from the
129:48 - uh away from the desk
129:50 - so the toilet is well actually for the
129:53 - toilet you can consult neufert
129:56 - or you can just go to google
129:59 - let's just type that in real quick
130:03 - just give me a second
130:05 - just a second there we go
130:08 - google uh
130:10 - toilet
130:12 - dimensions
130:16 - dimensions
130:17 - images sure
130:18 - why not
130:20 - and just find any image here and then
130:22 - you can see 690 by
130:25 - 35 let's see so 69 centimeters by 35
130:30 - centimeters sure
130:32 - i'll just draw it out as a rectangle for
130:34 - now because all i care about is just the
130:36 - size we will make it nice later
130:38 - uh
130:40 - 690 uh in well
130:43 - 350 in width
130:46 - 619 length
130:48 - 350
130:51 - 90 there we go
130:52 - something like that
130:54 - and just place it here
130:58 - which means that we do have
131:01 - a little bit of room for this to move
131:04 - out
131:05 - and i think we will we will use that
131:07 - i think we will use that
131:10 - should we use that
131:16 - yeah maybe we should
131:18 - uh so i'm just going to move everything
131:21 - to the to the side a little bit the way
131:24 - you do that is
131:26 - well
131:26 - you can just kind of select these two
131:31 - um
131:32 - these two polylines here and notice
131:34 - where where we have these points here i
131:37 - believe we can just kind of move those
131:39 - points around can't we
131:41 - let's see
131:42 - yes we can click on those points on
131:44 - those corners and just move them up and
131:47 - i'll just move them up by just sli a
131:50 - tiny bit um
131:54 - do i want to do that
131:56 - sorry sorry about this i i need to
132:00 - to design it in my head real fast do i
132:02 - want to move now i mean i do like the
132:04 - center composition here but maybe we can
132:06 - break the center composition
132:12 - nah i'll i'll keep it i'll keep it so
132:15 - i'll escape out of this
132:17 - and it's lagging escape
132:19 - i'll actually keep it that's fine
132:23 - it is what it is right the the opening
132:27 - when when the door here is opened you
132:29 - can't go through here but that is
132:33 - that is the bane of uh small small
132:36 - houses
132:38 - uh my thoughts were that i could move
132:40 - this opening towards somewhere here
132:42 - until here
132:44 - and then
132:45 - uh
132:46 - flip the door uh around again mirror it
132:50 - back to what it was before and then you
132:52 - will have a smooth transition and into
132:54 - the
132:57 - the toilet the bathroom but it's
133:01 - it's not ideal
133:02 - it's definitely not not ideal as well so
133:05 - might as well just keep it the way this
133:07 - is
133:08 - it's fine
133:10 - let's just move on
133:11 - so we have our toilet here the shower
133:15 - i don't even think we need to create a
133:19 - like a separate separate shower cabinet
133:21 - i think we can deal with this part here
133:24 - as a as a shower uh cabin
133:28 - uh in general so that's fine
133:32 - it will have
133:33 - a mark
133:36 - which shows that you know that the
133:37 - shower ends here and let me just
133:41 - measure the distance real fast
133:44 - how wide is it it's one meter wide so
133:47 - it's a pretty damn wide shower
133:51 - we can actually
133:57 - we don't need it to be that wide do we
133:59 - well
134:01 - we kind of do because if we put a sink
134:03 - here
134:05 - then we need a gap here yeah so so okay
134:08 - we will have a pretty large shower
134:10 - um but the depth of it is a little bit
134:15 - too big i think
134:17 - let's see the distance
134:21 - 1.15 meters um that's actually
134:24 - reasonable usually the like the smallest
134:27 - shower that you can have
134:29 - is
134:30 - 800
134:32 - by 800
134:34 - by 8
134:36 - 800 by 800 millimeters so something like
134:39 - this so
134:40 - here what we have is basically just a
134:43 - larger larger shower that's fine that's
134:46 - fine
134:47 - um maybe i will indeed move this line
134:50 - back by
134:51 - a negative
134:54 - or not negative just 150 millimeters
134:57 - so it's near by a meter a little bit
135:00 - cleaner right so this is where our
135:02 - shower is i think we have it planned out
135:04 - i think that's that's good enough
135:09 - now just adding a few
135:11 - bits and pieces here to the walls
135:14 - to make it a little bit more
135:16 - [Music]
135:18 - lively here
135:20 - okay so as you're preparing food you
135:23 - will want a window
135:26 - for sure so i will be creating a window
135:28 - here
135:30 - from here
135:32 - until here
135:33 - there's gonna be a window
135:35 - and let me just immediately make it
135:38 - thick line and let's draw it in a thick
135:40 - line there's going to be like a long
135:42 - window here
135:44 - and also you want a window for
135:48 - for the desk uh depending if you're
135:51 - using a computer or not um
135:54 - sometimes you don't want the window
135:56 - directly on the desk so my thoughts are
136:00 - what if we do
136:04 - what if we do a window that is
136:07 - straight up
136:09 - a corner window
136:11 - so it starts here
136:14 - and it's going to end here right so
136:16 - instead of that line it's just going to
136:19 - be a window all the way around and it's
136:21 - going to be like a corner corner window
136:24 - i think that's going to look cool
136:26 - uh so might as well do it and also it's
136:28 - going to be a little bit more of a
136:30 - challenge for us to actually
136:32 - make it nice so
136:34 - window right now i have a lot of stuff
136:37 - here that i don't really need to see so
136:39 - i'm going to expand my layers tab and
136:43 - i'll hide the thin line and the medium
136:45 - line layers by just clicking on the
136:47 - light bulbs here so now they're hidden
136:50 - uh just so that it's it's kind of easier
136:52 - for me to
136:54 - to work with this
136:56 - i will
136:57 - trim away
137:01 - trim
137:02 - enter enter trim away
137:05 - this whole portion
137:07 - of the
137:09 - of the building because that's where my
137:11 - window is going to be
137:13 - i'll make sure to join everything up
137:16 - so that this is
137:17 - a single
137:18 - polyline and this is a single polyline
137:22 - sorry
137:23 - and i'll turn on the medium layer again
137:27 - and make it my active one and i will
137:29 - draw out
137:32 - from here to here i'll draw out the
137:35 - window sill
137:36 - it's gonna be something like that
137:39 - right
137:41 - something like that
137:42 - and now all i need to do is just fill it
137:46 - the window sill into a corner right so
137:49 - i'll make sure that the radius is set to
137:52 - zero so fillet
137:54 - r enter r short for radius enter
137:57 - zero enter so i made sure that there's
138:01 - no rounding
138:03 - and i will just fill it this with this
138:06 - come on with this line enter to repeat
138:08 - the flat command and i'll fill it this
138:12 - with this
138:14 - there we go so they they get kind of
138:15 - extended and filleted into one
138:18 - one area
138:20 - or or one polyline
138:22 - well they are not one pole line yet uh
138:24 - these are two separate polylines that
138:27 - make a corner so i'll actually create a
138:29 - polyline here
138:31 - or or a line segment right there here
138:34 - and here
138:36 - i'll select
138:37 - all four of these lines
138:40 - that and
138:42 - that and i'll join them up
138:45 - join
138:47 - that's it now it's a single
138:50 - single closed polyline great
138:52 - so we have that
138:56 - now on to creating the window frames
138:59 - well to do that
139:01 - i will be using
139:04 - reusing this window frame here window
139:06 - frame cut here so i'll just copy it
139:10 - i'll copy it from the side midpoint
139:12 - right here
139:14 - to the midpoint right here
139:18 - there we go that's that's one frame
139:22 - that's being cut i'll also make a copy
139:24 - to the other side of the window
139:27 - from the bottom midpoint here to the
139:29 - midpoint here
139:31 - like that
139:33 - right now i need to know
139:36 - where exactly is the frame going to be
139:38 - located here in the corner and the way i
139:41 - do that is i'll just draw out two helper
139:44 - lines
139:45 - like that
139:47 - and like that
139:49 - so it goes from
139:50 - around the outer perimeter of the frame
139:52 - so from this point
139:54 - as well as from this point
139:56 - and they meet up in this corner meaning
139:59 - that now if i take this
140:01 - and i copy
140:02 - copy it from its corner point here
140:05 - to the corner
140:07 - here
140:09 - this is going to be like a
140:12 - clean transition clean 90
140:14 - 90 degree bend so i don't need the
140:16 - helper lines anymore i have the
140:20 - the corner frame located right here
140:25 - uh usually the corner frames do have a
140:27 - little bit more of a of a thickness to
140:31 - them but in this case since we're
140:32 - dealing with low
140:34 - uh low detailing level for our plants we
140:37 - don't really need to
140:40 - to show that
140:41 - that's fine the way it is now on to
140:45 - adding more frames because this is a
140:46 - pretty long window so it's going to have
140:49 - partitions
140:50 - i'm thinking of adding two partitions
140:52 - here
140:53 - so i will first measure the distance
140:56 - between this
140:58 - and
140:59 - this and i get
141:02 - 3325 millimeters which is not great but
141:05 - that's gonna do the trick i will just
141:08 - run um
141:08 - [Music]
141:10 - calculator three three two five divided
141:13 - by three
141:14 - is one point one meters approximately
141:18 - uh so what i'm going to do is i'm i'm
141:20 - just going to take this frame and i'll
141:23 - copy it
141:25 - i'll copy that
141:26 - that frame cut
141:28 - downwards
141:31 - by
141:32 - one one
141:33 - zero zero one point one meters
141:36 - like that and i'll take the bottom frame
141:39 - i'll copy it
141:42 - upwards
141:43 - by 1 1 0 0 enter
141:47 - escape out of the copy
141:50 - now i have like a pretty okay transition
141:54 - here
141:55 - and also i believe we do want at least
141:58 - one um
141:59 - window frame here in the middle so i'll
142:02 - repeat the process distance
142:05 - from here to here
142:06 - uh that's two two two five two
142:09 - five so that's going to be well
142:13 - math is hard okay let me grab calculator
142:16 - two five to five divided by two one two
142:19 - six five so
142:20 - i'll actually do this 1265.5
142:25 - so i'll take this uh this frame right
142:27 - here i'll copy it
142:30 - to the side
142:32 - 2565 i believe
142:35 - uh
142:36 - no no no no no
142:40 - uh
142:41 - 162 5.5 162 5.5
142:46 - no oh god damn it
142:48 - one two six five let's do it again
142:52 - i messed that up
142:57 - let me measure distance again goddammit
143:01 - uh
143:02 - two five two five right yeah two five
143:05 - two five divided two one two six five
143:08 - point five
143:10 - copy
143:12 - come on
143:14 - copy
143:18 - copy
143:19 - here to here one two six five point five
143:23 - enter
143:24 - there we go
143:26 - in the middle
143:29 - there
143:30 - okay so we have that done and actually
143:33 - it's not going to be in the middle right
143:34 - because the the frame itself has a
143:37 - certain amount of thickness let me just
143:39 - double check with measuring two
143:41 - distances from here to here we have one
143:43 - two one five point five and from here to
143:46 - here we have
143:49 - [Music]
143:52 - one two five nine
143:54 - point five
143:55 - um
144:00 - five nine point five one two one five
144:02 - so that is going to be
144:05 - [Music]
144:07 - i need to just keep calculator open one
144:09 - two five nine point five minus one two
144:13 - one five point five
144:15 - that's going to be 44 millimeters off of
144:18 - an error so i'm just going to move this
144:21 - further by 44
144:24 - millimeters now it's in the middle
144:26 - um you don't really need to
144:29 - well sorry not 44 that's going to be 22.
144:33 - you don't need to do this
144:35 - uh now as i'm doing it you don't need to
144:37 - do this it can be
144:40 - in this stage it can be approximate it
144:42 - doesn't need to be that precise um
144:45 - but just wanted to
144:47 - to kind of do it
144:49 - just for purpose of of of being
144:53 - methodical
144:55 - okay frames are done now it's time for
144:57 - glass so that's just line segments
145:01 - from midpoint
145:03 - midpoint here
145:05 - cutting through the glass
145:10 - mid to mid
145:13 - mid
145:14 - mid
145:16 - mid to mid
145:17 - that's done
145:19 - and now
145:20 - with thin line we'll
145:22 - keep layer turned on so i had it turned
145:25 - off so once i selected the thin line
145:27 - layer it asked me to turn it on so i did
145:31 - so with thin line layer uh i will create
145:34 - two more
145:35 - lines for each of the window window
145:38 - frame
145:40 - like that
145:45 - like that
145:47 - i'm just hitting enter to repeat the
145:49 - command
145:52 - so i'm finishing the command and then
145:53 - hitting enter to repeat the last command
145:56 - to kind of keep drawing the line
145:57 - segments
146:00 - that
146:01 - that and
146:03 - finally that okay we are done we have
146:07 - our corner corner window that is
146:10 - finished
146:13 - all right so that is our initial plan
146:17 - and that seems okay there's going to be
146:20 - a sink here
146:22 - um
146:22 - [Music]
146:23 - questionable design here maybe if we do
146:26 - an arc it's going to be fine
146:28 - let's do an arc
146:30 - so i'm going to
146:32 - or rather let's let's just do a poll
146:34 - line first so i know that uh
146:37 - the distance of this window is 900
146:40 - millimeters right 900 millimeters wide
146:43 - so i'm just going to make a sink that's
146:45 - 900
146:47 - in in length
146:50 - um and the width of it i actually want
146:52 - to use like 400 millimeters because it's
146:55 - just a sink
146:56 - um
146:57 - yeah sure let's use 400
147:01 - 900
147:03 - 400
147:04 - there we go so we have our sink here and
147:07 - i'll just
147:08 - move it
147:11 - m enter select objects enter from this
147:14 - point to this point right i just kind of
147:17 - move it and i'll place it in the medium
147:19 - layer
147:20 - like that and now um
147:23 - these corners right here are kind of
147:26 - obnoxious so what i'm gonna do is i will
147:30 - round them off
147:31 - as much as i can
147:34 - so my thoughts are
147:37 - i need to use fillet right
147:39 - for this so i will use fillette
147:43 - enter
147:44 - and i know that this is 400 millimeters
147:47 - so my radius cannot be larger than 400
147:51 - because it will just break it will not
147:54 - work right so i'm probably going to use
147:56 - something like 300 millimeters i think
147:58 - that's going to be enough so fill that
148:00 - radius 300 enter
148:04 - and then this line for let's with this
148:06 - line by 300 then enter to repeat the
148:09 - fillet this line let's move this line by
148:12 - 300
148:13 - that's it
148:14 - this is now a little bit better in terms
148:17 - of
148:18 - transit transition
148:20 - um
148:21 - what i really
148:22 - would encourage you doing in in your
148:25 - future projects is
148:27 - uh where we have the
148:29 - toilet
148:30 - we have this this area which which holds
148:33 - the water
148:34 - this whole area right here can be hidden
148:37 - in the in a wall right it can be placed
148:40 - in the wall but the wall of course needs
148:42 - to become thicker and as you place it in
148:45 - the wall above it you also have um
148:48 - possibility for shelves and and whatnot
148:51 - you know for for all of the
148:53 - you know toilet paper rolls and and so
148:55 - on so i would encourage you to
148:59 - in in your future projects just to do
149:02 - something like this um
149:05 - create a separate well in the medium
149:09 - thickness is it medium yeah let's do
149:11 - medium in medium thickness just create a
149:14 - shelf
149:15 - right
149:16 - enter come on
149:18 - just create a shelf that is around
149:21 - millimeters maybe even less 200
149:23 - millimeters wide
149:26 - like that
149:29 - like that
149:30 - so the shelf
149:32 - eats up
149:34 - the bottom or the the last part of the
149:37 - toilet
149:39 - and
149:40 - the only thing that is kind of sticking
149:42 - out from the shelf
149:43 - is the the bowl of of the toilet is just
149:47 - more aesthetic it's just nicer right so
149:50 - i'll just grab the polyline tool and
149:52 - redraw just the bowl area of the toilet
149:56 - um for that i do need to have
149:59 - intersection snapping turned on
150:02 - enter so that i can
150:05 - so that i can start drawing from this
150:06 - intersection point here and kind of
150:11 - draw out this u shape here right and now
150:14 - i can delete the old version
150:16 - right
150:17 - so this is just the bowl and let's fill
150:19 - it let's let's make it nicer so i'll
150:22 - fill it uh first i'll measure the
150:25 - distance
150:27 - from here to here
150:29 - well or rather from here to here we have
150:31 - 350 millimeters so half of that is 175
150:36 - millimeters so i'll do a fillet of 150
150:38 - millimeters for both corners
150:41 - let
150:44 - our r enter
150:46 - how much did i say 150 right 150
150:50 - from here
150:52 - to here 150 enter again from here to
150:55 - here 150. so we have that
150:58 - i will also close off this
151:01 - polyline by just creating a line segment
151:03 - here
151:04 - and joining it with the rest of of the
151:07 - bowl just to have it as a closed
151:09 - polyline and i will offset
151:12 - the bowl inwards by 50 millimeters five
151:15 - centimeters just to have something like
151:17 - that and now i will flat
151:20 - uh these two corners here with a little
151:23 - bit less of a
151:25 - of a radius so radius is going to be
151:27 - like 50 millimeters not more than that
151:31 - just to make it a little bit nicer
151:34 - so we have that and then just a small
151:36 - circle
151:37 - um the size of it doesn't matter the
151:39 - positioning of it doesn't matter
151:43 - just to to show maybe a little bit
151:46 - bigger just to show drainage
151:49 - come on yeah
151:53 - around the center point uh 1.5 times
151:56 - there we go
151:58 - so we have a
152:00 - toilet right
152:02 - i what what graphically i like to do is
152:04 - this toilet right here
152:06 - i like to
152:08 - make all of the inner lines thin while
152:10 - the outer line is medium right we are
152:13 - not cutting through the toilet
152:16 - um here in the shelf in the case of the
152:19 - shelf we are cutting through it but it
152:21 - is a furniture piece meaning that we are
152:23 - not going to be showing it
152:26 - in a thick line with a thick line rather
152:28 - it is going to be a medium line but it
152:30 - is going to have this kind of markup
152:34 - with a thin line this
152:38 - this
152:39 - right
152:41 - that means that this is a shelf
152:44 - okay same thing actually for this shelf
152:46 - as well from here to here
152:49 - and from here to here
152:50 - right or cabinet i guess
152:55 - so we have that done now for the sink
152:58 - same procedure we offset
153:01 - um
153:02 - 50 sure 50 is fine inwards
153:06 - we fill that
153:09 - radius 50.
153:12 - um i wonder if that's gonna be enough
153:15 - yeah that's enough actually
153:18 - that like that i will create a drainage
153:21 - hole here
153:23 - i'll just snap to the middle area
153:27 - that
153:28 - and i'll create a
153:30 - a tap you know where water flows from so
153:34 - i'll create a tap
153:36 - um i don't know 150 ml maybe
153:40 - 50 ml or no definitely not 50 ml 20 20
153:43 - millimeters
153:45 - 150
153:48 - something like that very simple uh you
153:50 - don't need to
153:52 - get rid of that you don't need to
153:55 - have it super super precise
153:57 - and this becomes a thin line as well so
153:59 - that's our our sink for the shower room
154:04 - i
154:04 - think what we can do
154:07 - is add a little bit of shelving here
154:10 - just a tiny bit like
154:11 - 10 centimeters
154:16 - like that
154:17 - uh well
154:18 - that will need to be medium this is for
154:20 - shampoo bottles and and all of that good
154:23 - stuff
154:25 - something like this
154:27 - uh then create just a circle somewhere
154:31 - i'll just snap to the midpoint let's see
154:33 - here and i'll say that the circle is 200
154:35 - millimeters in radius
154:37 - and just move it
154:41 - probably somewhere here
154:42 - so that's the shower
154:45 - shower head right which will
154:48 - pour water okay
154:50 - the bathroom is done
154:52 - the bathroom is indeed done
154:58 - let's move on to
154:59 - the
155:01 - bedroom slash workroom slash kitchen
155:03 - slash dining room slash living room
155:07 - um
155:09 - to the rest of the space
155:12 - i'll i'll kind of work on this
155:14 - real quick so i said that i want to have
155:17 - maybe refrigeration can go here so
155:19 - refrigeration is basically just um
155:23 - it's marked out like so
155:28 - like that
155:30 - then you take all of these lines and you
155:32 - scale them scale
155:34 - to the center point by
155:37 - 0.3 let's see
155:40 - like that
155:42 - that's refrigeration
155:44 - uh then you have uh
155:46 - so you take your food out you kind of
155:49 - wanna place it
155:53 - and then
155:55 - it's a little bit cramped
155:59 - okay you take the food out do you want
156:01 - to place it immediately or do you have
156:03 - placement here and you cook here
156:06 - and then wash here
156:09 - take out wash
156:11 - cook
156:12 - place take out wash place cook yeah so
156:16 - okay so this is going to be a sink
156:19 - and for the sink i'm just going to let's
156:22 - let's just draw draw out some sort of
156:24 - polyline that's going to be
156:26 - um
156:27 - the width of the sink let's say it's 500
156:29 - millimeters the length of the sink or
156:32 - the
156:33 - sorry the length of this thing is 500
156:34 - millimeters the depth of the sink is
156:36 - going to be like 300 millimeters not
156:39 - more than that um
156:42 - 500
156:43 - finish up
156:45 - fillet
156:48 - um and then we just fill it with just a
156:51 - little bit of a radius i'll just give it
156:53 - like five centimeter radius just so that
156:55 - it's nicer
156:57 - like that that
157:00 - that
157:02 - that yeah i'll just take this thing then
157:05 - and move it from the center point here
157:08 - to the
157:09 - from the middle point there to the
157:10 - middle point there and move it inwards
157:14 - into the cabinet by
157:16 - 50 centimeters something like that or 50
157:18 - millimeters sorry something like that so
157:20 - that you have a little bit of
157:22 - area to to place your stuff in
157:25 - in here i need a tab so i'll just borrow
157:28 - the tap from here
157:32 - copy
157:35 - [Music]
157:36 - move it here of course it needs to be
157:38 - rotated so i'll rotate it
157:43 - that
157:45 - actually find the way it is but i like
157:47 - to have them off center
157:51 - like that
157:53 - trim
157:54 - [Music]
157:55 - from that away i'll create a circle here
157:59 - around this midpoint
158:02 - the size doesn't matter
158:04 - like that that's our sink right nothing
158:07 - nothing more than that
158:09 - then this is just a cutting area so we
158:12 - don't need to do anything with it and
158:14 - this is our cooking area cooking stove
158:16 - so cooking stove is basically
158:19 - um it just has four
158:22 - uh heater blocks right so what i'm going
158:25 - to do is i'll just
158:26 - be a little bit cheeky and i'll separate
158:29 - all of this into four
158:31 - four segments and then for each of these
158:33 - four segments i will just create this
158:35 - kind of a diagonal line
158:37 - and you'll understand why i'm doing this
158:39 - in just a second
158:42 - so i have these diagonal lines here um
158:45 - each of them have a center point right
158:47 - and i can use those center points to
158:50 - show
158:51 - you know to use as as
158:53 - center points for my circles which will
158:55 - show the heater blocks for the stove
158:58 - right so
158:59 - usually you have two that are in say the
159:02 - same size so i'll just use 70
159:04 - millimeters for this one
159:08 - 70 millimeters for this one then you
159:11 - have one pretty large one
159:13 - uh so this one let's say is going to be
159:16 - a hundred millimeters and you have one a
159:19 - pretty like pretty small uh let's do 15.
159:23 - 50 millimeters now i don't need anything
159:26 - else
159:27 - i just have those those four heater
159:29 - blocks uh looks bad
159:32 - why does it look bad that's because it's
159:34 - too close to the to the edge here but
159:37 - well maybe we can just do this and no
159:39 - one will know
159:41 - that's better okay
159:44 - that's it that's it with the kitchen uh
159:46 - i will want to draw a cabinet above
159:49 - above
159:50 - the or maybe i don't want a cabinet
160:04 - i need to fix one thing the refrigerator
160:07 - is high right
160:09 - and the window is going to be behind the
160:12 - refrigerator so this is a bad design
160:15 - right so i'm going to re remake this
160:18 - this whole area right here
160:20 - um that's my bed sorry about that so
160:23 - actually this this wall right here it
160:25 - needs to extend until the end of the
160:28 - refrigerator so i'm going to
160:32 - how do we do this well let's let's first
160:34 - create that that wall segment here
160:38 - or rather first let's
160:40 - yeah
160:41 - let's create the wall segment here
160:44 - like that
160:46 - perfect now let's actually select the
160:49 - blue uh
160:51 - blue windowsill line
160:53 - and
160:54 - move its points from here
160:57 - to here you can also do trimming and so
161:00 - on but just moving those points around
161:02 - this is fine
161:04 - so we do that then we
161:06 - then we trim
161:07 - [Music]
161:08 - enter enter we trim away this area right
161:11 - here
161:12 - like so
161:14 - and we join everything back up so this
161:16 - is joined
161:18 - that's clean that is also clean okay so
161:21 - now i will take the frame copy
161:24 - from here
161:26 - to here how wide is it
161:30 - from here to here we have uh one point
161:33 - almost two meters that's still too wide
161:36 - so i'm going to
161:38 - oh
161:39 - it's not that wide but no i'll still add
161:43 - a division here
161:44 - so if it's
161:46 - actually i'll show you another way of
161:48 - how to do this if you just draw a line
161:50 - segment here and you use the midpoint of
161:52 - that line as your helper
161:54 - copy
161:55 - from the midpoint here
161:58 - to the midpoint here and then delete the
162:00 - helper you don't really need to do any
162:02 - maths it's right in the middle
162:05 - that's kind of useful
162:07 - um actually i'll just draw out the lines
162:09 - in one layer and then just switch the
162:13 - switch the layers around of already
162:15 - existing lines
162:20 - oh man the sun is shining
162:23 - that's not you usually you need to do
162:27 - this that's not usual in sweden
162:31 - i assume we will get like two weeks of
162:33 - rain now because of this displeasure
162:35 - that we have
162:38 - of the two days of sun
162:41 - okay
162:42 - so we're back on track right we we have
162:44 - this we have this done
162:47 - all right all right all right all right
162:52 - what's next
162:57 - i will add a cabinet above
163:02 - like near the ceiling but i will do that
163:04 - later
163:05 - not now
163:09 - let's solve this and then we'll move on
163:11 - to
163:13 - to creating the section
163:17 - so this
163:19 - we have our table
163:21 - right that's just a table we don't
163:22 - really need to add anything to it if you
163:24 - want you can add a monitor or
163:27 - you can add some books and whatnot you
163:29 - know you can make it more lively but
163:32 - it's just a table so that's fine and we
163:34 - have a bed so for the table i need a
163:36 - chair so i'll just kind of create a
163:39 - circle that's uh let's go for
163:42 - um
163:43 - radius of a chair
163:47 - radius of a chair let's say
163:51 - um
163:53 - 20 centimeters
163:56 - so 40
163:57 - 40 centimeters in time no that's that's
163:59 - too too little
164:01 - circle let's let's do 50. so 25
164:04 - centimeters in radius
164:06 - something like that and my chair is
164:09 - going to
164:11 - let's say it has a bag brace that is an
164:14 - arc so i will just offset
164:16 - it inwards by five centimeters
164:19 - i'll just grab the
164:21 - i'll just create a two line tools here
164:24 - or two lines here to both sides
164:27 - um and then i'll just go to town
164:29 - trimming everything that i don't need so
164:32 - i trim enter enter i don't need this
164:36 - this this or that
164:38 - that's it um
164:41 - this whole thing gets joined
164:44 - so now it's it's a
164:46 - single pole line and this is another a
164:48 - line
164:49 - or rather a circle so here
164:52 - this guy right here is going to be
164:54 - medium this guy right here is going to
164:55 - be thin and the chair is going to be
164:59 - what i like to do is i like to rotate
165:03 - um
165:05 - rotate the the chair just a tiny bit
165:07 - that's not a tiny bit so let me rotate
165:10 - it back
165:12 - just a tiny bit to make it more lively
165:14 - and place it underneath
165:16 - the table slightly
165:18 - right
165:20 - trim away with the table there we go
165:23 - uh just so that it's you know
165:25 - under the table and and you can see that
165:28 - it's it's actually a chair
165:30 - um
165:31 - so that is that now for the bed
165:35 - the bed the bed the bed um
165:38 - we really need just pillows and and the
165:42 - bed sheets right to show this as a bed
165:44 - so that's not going to be tricky
165:47 - i'm going to just grab a
165:49 - rectangle tool
165:52 - and i'll just make
165:57 - two random rectangles for the pillows
166:00 - they pillows are not that accurate so i
166:02 - can kind of get away in making weird
166:05 - ones
166:06 - um
166:07 - just for
166:08 - reference i'll measure the distance
166:10 - that's 300 millimeters so i will fill
166:13 - that
166:15 - all of the pillows by
166:17 - [Music]
166:20 - 130 millimeters or 140 millimeters right
166:24 - so all of the corners get related
166:26 - wait that's
166:30 - again
166:32 - the let
166:34 - r enter 140 enter
166:39 - ah there we go now it works okay
166:42 - so just fill it let it fill it
166:48 - uh
166:50 - right now i should probably i forgot to
166:52 - mention one thing there's one more
166:54 - snapping option that that you can
166:56 - accidentally enable and that's called
166:58 - grid snapping
167:00 - which i believe is
167:03 - yeah
167:03 - it's right here snapping mode grid
167:07 - if you have this turned on
167:09 - then your cursor or when when you're
167:12 - trying to draw something
167:14 - it's going to snap
167:17 - to the grid lines
167:18 - like so
167:20 - that is obnoxious and i absolutely hate
167:23 - that so just make sure that grid
167:25 - snapping right here in the bottom is
167:27 - turned off right just
167:30 - just a tip
167:31 - okay so we have two
167:33 - weird pillows here one large one one one
167:36 - smaller one that's that's fine i can
167:38 - actually place them together and
167:42 - trim
167:43 - the let's see the large one with the
167:45 - small one like that
167:47 - go away
167:48 - like that i will make them
167:51 - pin
167:52 - like so so those are two two pillows and
167:55 - let me just position them
167:57 - a little bit more centered
168:00 - like so
168:01 - uh then we have a bed sheet that will
168:04 - go over the pillows
168:06 - so it just kind of
168:08 - goes over them like so
168:11 - right and it trims
168:14 - away of the pillows
168:18 - that is the bed sheet and the bed sheet
168:20 - uh usually the the way i i personally
168:23 - prefer doing it is it it has this kind
168:26 - of a
168:27 - hold
168:28 - here
168:32 - right
168:33 - so it's it's
168:34 - folded folded out
168:37 - that's it that's that's the bed with two
168:39 - pillows kind of tucked away be behind
168:41 - the bed sheet
168:43 - all right we have this uh this plan
168:46 - then the plan
168:49 - let's move on to creating a section
168:52 - so
168:54 - or or no sorry well maybe
168:58 - apologies just a second
169:00 - i'm gonna think
169:02 - can we move into section making
169:06 - yeah let's move into section making so
169:08 - the first thing that we want to do is we
169:10 - want to mark out where we're going to
169:12 - cut the building through right with
169:16 - what's the cutting line so i'm just
169:18 - going to create a straight line segment
169:22 - like that and i'm just going to see
169:24 - where with the move tool where i can
169:26 - position it so that it cuts and shows
169:28 - the most things so my thoughts are
169:32 - and usually you don't want to cut
169:34 - through the
169:36 - furniture
169:37 - you either show the furniture in the
169:39 - projection of the cut or you
169:42 - or you don't
169:43 - right but you don't cut through the
169:45 - furniture in this case we are going to
169:47 - be cutting through the sink but that is
169:51 - fine
169:52 - if you are cutting through furniture you
169:55 - you're not hatching it in so you're not
169:58 - filling in the cut
170:00 - that is important
170:02 - to note
170:03 - you're just showing it as if it's in the
170:05 - projection
170:06 - um let's do that i think we can do that
170:10 - because
170:11 - we will see quite quite a bit
170:13 - and my viewing direction is going to be
170:18 - that away
170:20 - right so i'm going to see
170:22 - uh
170:23 - i'm going to be cutting through the
170:25 - window through the sink through the door
170:27 - through another door
170:30 - through another window i'm going to be
170:32 - seeing the door the side of the the
170:35 - cabinet
170:37 - here the or the side of the shelf here
170:40 - the
170:40 - [Music]
170:41 - kitchen
170:42 - area kitchen front i'll see uh
170:47 - side of the window
170:49 - and um
170:50 - and the toilet what i won't see is the
170:53 - shower the bedroom uh or the the bed and
170:57 - the work table which is fine
171:00 - it's
171:01 - you know you can't
171:02 - add everything to a single section
171:04 - usually you need to do more than one
171:07 - section to show everything in the
171:08 - building
171:09 - that's fine um so the way i really like
171:12 - doing this is
171:14 - first i will go to layer properties
171:17 - here and i'll just create a new layer
171:19 - and i'll call it helper
171:22 - helper layer and it can be white that's
171:24 - fine just
171:26 - a single additional layer i'll make it
171:29 - my active layer so that's my helper and
171:32 - what i want to do is basically make a
171:34 - cut here so i need to
171:36 - to have all of the
171:38 - correct dimensions so my workflow and it
171:41 - might be
171:42 - i think it's it's a workflow of everyone
171:45 - who uses autocad is just dragging out
171:51 - just dragging out
171:53 - the the lines or maybe i should should
171:56 - draw it from here just so that it's it's
171:58 - clear more clear for you
172:01 - dragging out
172:03 - the main lines
172:10 - that that i wanna
172:12 - i wanna keep working with right that i
172:14 - will see in this section
172:17 - so that
172:19 - that can come in later well no
172:21 - let's let's do it now
172:24 - like that
172:26 - then this is gonna be a line
172:29 - this doesn't necessarily need to be a
172:32 - line but i will
172:34 - i'll add it
172:36 - um then we have the whole kitchen area
172:38 - so
172:40 - this edge right here is going to be a
172:42 - line
172:44 - and then we will have the last
172:46 - line here so we have a bunch of like
172:48 - vertical lines extended there's like uh
172:52 - that
172:53 - i forgot the name of it
172:56 - just a second
172:59 - how is it called um
173:03 - construction line
173:05 - i think it's construction line
173:09 - yeah so there is one more uh tool that
173:12 - can be used and it's called construction
173:14 - line so
173:16 - um it's it's located right here
173:19 - or the shortcut for it is x
173:22 - line and
173:24 - the thing about x lines is that they are
173:28 - infinite in length right
173:31 - so you can use construction lines but
173:33 - this is a very simple project so i'm not
173:36 - i'm not really used using them right in
173:39 - in this case
173:41 - so i'm just dragging out regular ones
173:44 - um right so we have that
173:47 - and now i i will just start drawing
173:49 - right so i'll create uh
173:52 - let's stick to the helper layer for now
173:55 - uh first thing that i do is i'll just
173:57 - draw a horizontal line this is going to
174:00 - be my ground right
174:02 - this is my ground
174:04 - line
174:04 - and basically my building
174:06 - starts here with this line and ends here
174:09 - with this line right and i'm taking that
174:12 - projection and looking at it
174:14 - all right
174:15 - so i have that going on
174:17 - and
174:18 - now now i can actually start drawing
174:22 - right so let me go and create a thick
174:26 - create a thick
174:28 - line here
174:31 - and create a polyline
174:35 - sorry change this to thick layer and
174:37 - create a polyline
174:39 - and i'll just draw out
174:42 - in between the
174:44 - the walls so this wall right here and
174:47 - this wall right here in between them
174:48 - i'll draw out the floor slab so i know
174:51 - that the floor slab will start from here
174:53 - will end here its height is going to be
174:56 - something around
174:58 - i would say 400 millimeters
175:03 - something like that or 100
175:06 - initials up here
175:08 - bam
175:09 - that's done that's my floor slab and i
175:12 - accidentally um
175:14 - drew it above
175:16 - the
175:17 - ground line
175:18 - right so this is like our ground
175:22 - uh
175:23 - ground cut that
175:25 - where we start cutting through the earth
175:27 - so this is air this is
175:29 - this is air this is earth right so i'm
175:32 - going to just take this and
175:34 - move it into the ground like that
175:38 - okay so that is done
175:40 - now
175:41 - uh my walls
175:43 - right i'll just kind of create the the
175:45 - walls so the question is how high
175:49 - is the ceiling going to be and what kind
175:52 - of roof are we going to have
175:54 - that's that's the main question and i
175:56 - haven't sketched this out so i have no
175:58 - idea
175:58 - um
176:00 - my thoughts are
176:04 - let's have an awkward pitched roof
176:07 - why why the heck not
176:09 - right let's let's have an awkward
176:11 - awkward pitched roof
176:16 - maybe
176:22 - give me a second and i'm just thinking
176:25 - um
176:26 - or
176:28 - no i will not be making a pitched roof
176:30 - instead i'll i'll make like a like a
176:33 - separate some sort of a separated roof
176:35 - here uh why not so
176:38 - i need
176:39 - the height of the ceiling right so i
176:42 - will offset
176:44 - i will offset this ground line
176:47 - uh by
176:48 - by how much
176:49 - how much by how much
176:51 - i can also just copy it up as well
176:54 - let's say the ceiling height
176:57 - in my shower is just going to be 2 600
177:01 - millimeters
177:03 - 2.6 meters
177:06 - which is probably going to be pretty
177:08 - high
177:08 - that's pretty high let's do less
177:12 - offset 2 400 millimeters
177:20 - also pretty high
177:23 - go again offset
177:26 - 2
177:28 - 300 millimeters
177:29 - i don't want to go lower than that so
177:32 - okay so that's my ceiling height in this
177:34 - area and for this area i will want a
177:38 - higher ceiling height so let's say
177:41 - offset
177:44 - three thousand
177:45 - yeah just let's just do three meters
177:47 - three thousand millimeters
177:49 - something like that so that's going to
177:51 - be the ceiling height in this area right
177:53 - here
177:55 - um
177:57 - i think that's going to work i think
177:59 - that's
178:01 - that should work right yeah that should
178:03 - work
178:06 - yeah it's gonna work okay
178:09 - so now um
178:10 - i have my floor slab
178:12 - i need to create walls right so i'll
178:15 - just grab a polyline tool and i will
178:18 - just start drawing in the walls so
178:23 - my wall here is going to look like
178:27 - that
178:29 - enter
178:30 - right and my wall here is going to be
178:34 - larger it's going to look like that
178:38 - enter
178:40 - right so i have one wall here one wall
178:42 - here
178:43 - and the ground slab here or or the floor
178:47 - slab here
178:48 - okay so we have that done
178:50 - now for the
178:52 - actual roof slabs
178:55 - i will create more offsets here bear
178:58 - with me
179:00 - offset
179:02 - and the roof is usually thicker than the
179:04 - walls
179:05 - these days the roof is around 700
179:07 - millimeters thick in
179:09 - [Music]
179:10 - you know in buildings
179:13 - but for this particular summer house i
179:15 - think we can get away with uh
179:18 - 500 400 millimeters i'll just do 400
179:23 - well 450 let's let's have the middle
179:26 - ground here so i will offset it by 450
179:30 - and i'll offset the ceiling the the high
179:32 - splint up by 450 and the smaller ceiling
179:36 - up by 450
179:37 - like that that's a lot of lines to to
179:40 - look at now right and you will get used
179:43 - to it
179:44 - eventually
179:46 - um now actually what i can just do is i
179:49 - can take a rectangle tool
179:52 - and just draw out
179:55 - the roof slab
179:58 - let's see
179:59 - how far will the lower roof slab reach
180:05 - probably until here right
180:10 - and then we will have the the large roof
180:13 - slab going on here yeah i think that's
180:16 - that's gonna be
180:17 - that's gonna be the trick so
180:20 - i have this line marked out and this is
180:22 - going to be how far the bottom row slab
180:25 - reaches so i'm just going to draw out oh
180:28 - now i forgot
180:30 - it's this line here so i'm just going to
180:32 - draw out a rectangle
180:34 - like so
180:36 - that's my bottom roof slab
180:38 - and then for the top roof slab of course
180:41 - it continues on from where the bottom
180:44 - row slap ended
180:46 - you know until here
180:48 - there we go
180:50 - so we have
180:51 - roof roof wall wall
180:55 - floor
180:56 - let me delete
181:00 - all of the horizontal lines
181:02 - we don't need them anymore we will be
181:04 - working with vertical lines
181:07 - but we don't need the horizontal ones
181:09 - anymore
181:11 - um right
181:13 - so we have that going on
181:15 - now let's
181:16 - create some foundation foundation blocks
181:19 - because this is a little bit
181:21 - a little bit obnoxious right the way
181:23 - this this connection looks like that's
181:25 - not a strong connection
181:27 - um so i'll create a polyline
181:30 - and i'll just create a block
181:32 - that how how with how deep is
181:37 - how deep is the floor
181:40 - so the floor is 400 millimeters deep so
181:43 - i'll create a foundation block that is
181:46 - plus
181:48 - let's say plus 600 millimeters
181:51 - so the foundation block is going to be
181:53 - one meter deep from the
181:56 - from the wall
181:58 - right
181:59 - uh so
182:00 - polyline going down
182:04 - 1 000 millimeters
182:06 - finishing up here
182:08 - connecting as
182:11 - as a rectangle
182:12 - same thing here well actually let's just
182:15 - copy it why not
182:16 - copy
182:18 - from here
182:19 - here so that's the foundation that's
182:21 - going into the into the ground okay
182:24 - that is them
182:26 - now
182:28 - i kind of want to clean everything up
182:30 - right so i will hide the helper layer
182:34 - for for just a tiny bit
182:36 - i will hide it and i want to join
182:39 - everything up into one
182:42 - big happy
182:44 - family and also one more thing that i
182:46 - want to do is add a wall segment right
182:50 - here because these two roofs need to
182:52 - connect right so i will create a
182:54 - polyline
182:56 - from here uh to here
182:59 - and it's going to be uh
183:02 - let's do
183:04 - honestly i would want to do 400
183:07 - millimeters but in this case let's do
183:09 - 250
183:11 - 50
183:12 - and how long is it 700 millimeters down
183:15 - and just close it off like that
183:17 - okay
183:19 - so now we have our our shape and
183:22 - honestly
183:24 - honestly the way i would do this i could
183:27 - start trimming and joining but this is
183:30 - going to be so much faster if i just
183:33 - uh change this to medium layer
183:36 - turn on thick layer or change this to
183:38 - medium layer escape out
183:41 - and draw redraw everything in thick
183:44 - layer as a single or as two polylines
183:47 - like that
183:50 - so just going around the perimeter
183:53 - yep messed it up
183:55 - there we go
183:57 - and then going around the inner
183:59 - perimeter
184:03 - like that
184:05 - then i just hide the thick layer
184:08 - i
184:09 - turn the current layer off whatever
184:12 - delete the medium layer
184:14 - and turn the thick layer again
184:17 - and i messed it up
184:20 - so there needs to be a line here and it
184:22 - needs to be joined up there we go you
184:25 - should see something like this right
184:27 - so that is
184:28 - uh the section of your or rather the
184:32 - exterior envelope of you of this
184:35 - particular building right that i want i
184:38 - also will add just so that i don't
184:40 - forget i will add
184:42 - ground
184:44 - here and here that's the ground cut line
184:48 - and i will actually take this uh this
184:51 - ground cut line and i will move it down
184:54 - by five
184:55 - uh or 50 millimeters just so that the
185:00 - uh the the floor slab is five
185:02 - centimeters higher than the ground
185:04 - uh the reason for that is when it's
185:06 - raining you don't want the rain to visit
185:09 - your house
185:10 - right so
185:12 - that's the reason that's the reason
185:15 - also it it's it's good for for kind of
185:18 - brushing uh the the
185:21 - dirt out of the building as well
185:24 - uh as as you leave the to the building
185:27 - okay
185:28 - so that's ground that's that's uh
185:31 - our little building here let's continue
185:33 - on
185:34 - so now i want to add partitioning walls
185:37 - because i can see that
185:39 - there is going to be a partitioning wall
185:41 - here
185:42 - where we will also show that we are
185:44 - cutting through the
185:47 - the doorway
185:48 - and also there is going to be like a
185:50 - retaining or partitioning wall that we
185:52 - will just see in the back
185:54 - right
185:55 - so we need that as well
185:58 - let's do that let us
186:01 - let us do that
186:03 - so i will go
186:05 - into my helper
186:08 - i will enable my helper
186:11 - layer i'll start drawing some rectangles
186:14 - wrecked
186:14 - rectangle
186:16 - so partitioning wall right here
186:20 - that
186:21 - just a rectangle
186:23 - um then there's no partitioning wall
186:25 - here but there is going to be a
186:27 - partition goal here but i accidentally
186:30 - forgot to add
186:34 - do we need to add or maybe we can use
186:36 - this
186:40 - um
186:43 - it can be kinda joined up
186:47 - with the shelf
186:49 - in a way
186:53 - yeah let's let's do it uh let's do it
186:55 - this way i'll just create a one more
186:57 - helper line from this point here
187:00 - downwards
187:02 - uh we'll create a thick line a rectangle
187:06 - just something like so
187:08 - like that and i will create a very weird
187:14 - with a medium line
187:16 - or rather this sorry sorry sorry sorry
187:19 - this needs to be a medium line because
187:21 - we are not cutting through it of course
187:23 - we are not cutting through it so it is
187:25 - indeed medium line
187:27 - thickness
187:28 - and i will create one more medium line
187:30 - that shows the
187:32 - shelf at the at the side
187:34 - so it's going to look like it is going
187:36 - to look weird but that is fine
187:39 - that is okay usually uh you don't have
187:42 - these kind of weird gaps here but
187:45 - actually we can kind of since we are
187:47 - since we are here
187:50 - and i just kind of
187:53 - fix it yeah let's fix it
187:55 - uh so i'll delete the two helper lines
187:58 - that are for help helper lines that i
188:00 - don't need anymore
188:02 - i will kind of add them later on i don't
188:04 - need these anymore as well actually i
188:06 - don't need any of these anymore
188:10 - great we can delete all of them and i
188:12 - wanna fix this area right here this is
188:14 - an awkward area
188:17 - so what i'm gonna do is i will go in
188:20 - here
188:35 - oh i know i know uh so
188:38 - let me just create a line segment here
188:41 - just so that i don't forget where it
188:43 - ends
188:44 - and all i will do is just take these
188:48 - points and move them to perpendicular
188:51 - snap
188:55 - what the hell perpendicular snapping is
188:56 - turned on why is this not working
188:59 - fine
189:00 - fine
189:01 - we will do it the other way around i
189:04 - will trim enter enter
189:07 - delete that segment here
189:10 - i will extend
189:13 - this line
189:14 - to here or
189:16 - enter
189:17 - extend
189:21 - to here
189:22 - enter this line like that
189:25 - and then i will create a thick line
189:28 - segment right here
189:32 - at
189:33 - and i will fill that
189:35 - there we go
189:37 - uh fill it with radius of zero
189:39 - so fillet radius zero
189:42 - from here to here
189:45 - that is done and now it just needs to be
189:48 - joined up properly
189:51 - join
189:53 - should be good yes it's good so
189:56 - ah
189:57 - right and now
189:58 - just a rectangle
190:01 - for the shelf
190:03 - like that
190:04 - okay so now it's done sorry
190:06 - i just wanted to clean it up a little
190:09 - bit
190:10 - um just to make it a bit a bit nicer
190:14 - okay so we have that done uh now for the
190:18 - let's add the doors and the windows into
190:21 - the walls
190:22 - right
190:23 - uh so
190:26 - let's start with a window opening here
190:28 - on the left hand side right so my
190:31 - windowsill is going to be probably
190:33 - somewhere around
190:34 - i'll just start drawing here from from
190:36 - the bottom up it's going to be offset
190:40 - and i'm going to offset it
190:43 - uh 1.1 meters 1 1 0 0
190:48 - something like that
190:51 - and the height of the window is probably
190:53 - going to be until the
190:55 - until the
190:56 - roof
190:57 - right so i'm just going to not even
191:00 - measure but just
191:01 - draw it like that
191:03 - that's it
191:04 - right
191:05 - i will change this to
191:07 - the thick layer
191:09 - select it
191:13 - get rid of that
191:15 - join everything up that's done right so
191:18 - the the
191:19 - the window opening is done and then it's
191:21 - absolutely the same procedure as what
191:23 - we've done in the plan so i will not be
191:26 - kind of talking about it i'll just
191:28 - really quickly be
191:30 - recreating it
191:31 - i'll actually even make a shortcut i'll
191:33 - just borrow the
191:35 - existing window
191:37 - here
191:41 - like that
191:46 - there we go
191:47 - so we have a window here
191:49 - um
191:50 - doorway
191:52 - doorway is very simple all we need to do
191:54 - is just
191:56 - well we need to know how high the
191:58 - doorway is and it it is a
192:00 - 2
192:02 - meter 2.1 meters
192:04 - high
192:06 - that's
192:07 - that's almost nothing
192:09 - that's almost nothing okay and i will
192:12 - just trim
192:12 - [Music]
192:14 - uh
192:15 - trim enter
192:17 - trim away everything except for
192:20 - except for the
192:22 - top
192:23 - you know this little area right here and
192:26 - actually i want to
192:27 - join it in with the with the roof
192:31 - so i will
192:32 - trim enter
192:35 - like that
192:36 - join everything up
192:38 - uh it gets joined up into the incorrect
192:40 - layer so i'll just switch the layers
192:42 - around like that
192:43 - um now let's go for the thick line
192:46 - because we are going to be cutting
192:48 - through the doors and just add a door
192:50 - segment here
192:52 - um honestly
192:54 - let's make it a little bit nicer i'll
192:56 - just borrow the
192:58 - the frame we will just use the same
193:00 - frame for the door
193:02 - copy
193:04 - from here
193:05 - to here like that
193:07 - that's that's the frame for the door and
193:09 - maybe we can make it a little bit nicer
193:11 - as well yeah let's just make it nice um
193:14 - so that frame is going to be
193:16 - all the way through and it's going to be
193:18 - five centimeters thick and
193:21 - 40 centimeters wide
193:23 - it's a wide frame right
193:26 - um and it's going to
193:28 - have a door
193:30 - going through from the middle of it like
193:32 - like that so we are cutting through the
193:34 - door and we also see the back of the
193:36 - frame as per usual right so we see
193:40 - this wall right here in our projection
193:43 - so that is going to be a medium line and
193:46 - it's going to be a rectangle
193:50 - like so i can't draw a rectangle
193:54 - properly let me just draw a pole line
193:56 - then instead 140 millimeters with
194:00 - there we go
194:01 - so that's our door doorway right
194:04 - and that's done now to show a doorway in
194:08 - the
194:10 - in the projection
194:12 - i already have the 2.1 meter height here
194:16 - so i don't really need to invent
194:18 - anything and i know that this doorway is
194:20 - 90 centimeters wide
194:23 - so i don't really need to and make any
194:25 - calculations i can just do
194:27 - this
194:28 - 900
194:32 - bam
194:33 - bam
194:35 - bam
194:36 - like that um and then
194:41 - then i kind of want to
194:44 - i don't really need the bottom line do i
194:46 - okay let me
194:48 - explode
194:50 - so i explode this fall line i will
194:52 - delete the bottom line
194:54 - i will take this
194:56 - this line segments that are left again
194:58 - it's upside down u now i will join them
195:01 - up
195:02 - perfect and i will i will offset
195:05 - all of this by 50
195:08 - millimeters
195:09 - inwards
195:10 - so that's our frame for the door and for
195:14 - the handle i will just
195:16 - where's that water
195:18 - tap i'll just use the handle here
195:27 - doesn't need to be precise just
195:29 - something like that
195:30 - so that's that's the handle
195:32 - um and that's honestly that's honestly
195:35 - it in terms of the doorway that's our
195:38 - shelf
195:40 - that's good that's our wall
195:42 - it's also good then we have the kitchen
195:45 - kitchen cabinet and we have another
195:47 - really large window here so for this
195:50 - window i know that here i'll have a
195:52 - kitchen cabinet and the kitchen cabinet
195:54 - is always 1.1 meters high uh so
195:58 - this window line that i
196:00 - i drew here kind of continues on right
196:04 - and the first thing that i'm going to do
196:06 - is i will make
196:09 - [Music]
196:13 - i'll probably make something like this
196:16 - right so the window is going to be
196:18 - located here and then i have the
196:20 - possibility to add shelving here in the
196:23 - top
196:24 - i think the storage i think that's
196:26 - that's fine
196:27 - so
196:28 - i will
196:29 - trim
196:32 - enter
196:33 - cut away that part right because that's
196:35 - where the window is going to be located
196:38 - now i can delete
196:41 - um and i will
196:44 - draw
196:47 - two line segments here
196:49 - as per usual
196:51 - join everything up ah
196:53 - change the layer
196:56 - change the layer of this one as well
196:59 - there we go
197:00 - and honestly i think i can just kind of
197:03 - cheat
197:04 - and do this
197:06 - yes i can okay
197:07 - so i'll just uh take that window and
197:10 - place it in there as well
197:12 - so we have that but also i have the
197:15 - window
197:18 - going until
197:19 - until here
197:22 - right
197:24 - because i see i see this with this this
197:26 - window area here and it's actually not
197:28 - going until the the wall it's actually
197:31 - stopping
197:34 - right here right
197:36 - uh so i will have
197:40 - let me draw this u shape here
197:44 - i will have a window here
197:47 - like that
197:49 - which means
197:51 - that now i don't see this line anymore
197:54 - because it's a corner window right so i
197:55 - don't don't have
197:58 - don't have neither this
198:00 - nor this line anymore so i can just
198:02 - delete it
198:04 - right because i
198:06 - as i'm looking through this i never see
198:08 - the you know
198:10 - here i see the the wall here i won't see
198:13 - the wall right because i'm looking
198:15 - through it i'm i'm i have a window that
198:18 - goes through the whole facade
198:20 - uh so that's done now i will
198:24 - offset
198:26 - 50 millimeters
198:28 - i will offset this by 50 millimeters
198:30 - like that
198:31 - and i will actually extend it
198:36 - just by grabbing the control points
198:40 - or you can use extend tool that's fine
198:42 - as well
198:44 - i'll extend it until this one so this is
198:45 - the frame that we see right
198:48 - uh now i can see that there are going to
198:51 - be divisions here
198:55 - uh well at least one division here so
198:58 - i'm just going to kind of draw out those
199:00 - two lines because i'm lazy
199:03 - like that
199:05 - and i'll use trim
199:06 - enter enter
199:08 - to kind of clean everything up
199:11 - so
199:13 - come on
199:15 - there we go and then get rid of the rest
199:18 - but that's that's my window
199:20 - yeah that that's that's all all i need
199:22 - to show
199:24 - um now for the kitchen cabinets uh
199:27 - and actually maybe i want no i'll i'll
199:30 - stick to this for the kitchen cabinets
199:32 - it's going to be uh just a polyline and
199:34 - just
199:36 - a rectangle
199:37 - or maybe we can do
199:39 - let's do let's do it this way
199:42 - from here to here
199:44 - 600 millimeters
199:47 - down here
199:48 - um
199:51 - so that is like one
199:54 - one block
199:57 - copy that
200:05 - that that is my kitchen and
200:08 - my refrigerator is actually going to be
200:10 - larger than that so i will
200:15 - i will say that my refrigerator is an
200:17 - arrow boy that just kind of fits in
200:19 - there
200:20 - like this
200:21 - right um now for the top shelving i
200:23 - actually kind of want to have
200:26 - shelves in the top so i'm just going to
200:28 - say
200:29 - um
200:31 - there's gonna be
200:33 - like a
200:34 - single cabinet here and then there is
200:36 - going to be like open shelving here so
200:38 - i'll just offset it inwards by 50
200:41 - millimeters
200:43 - so that is open shelving and this is
200:45 - like closed cabinet shelving to which i
200:47 - can add
200:49 - a handle
200:52 - like that
200:54 - all right um
200:57 - we can do uh a wire tap as well
201:02 - uh wait where is our water there we go
201:05 - this it's uh
201:08 - that it's it's there right so i will
201:11 - just kind of
201:13 - create
201:14 - a
201:15 - a a circle
201:16 - trim
201:19 - trim
201:20 - enter
201:21 - bam do something like that uh create a
201:25 - poll line
201:27 - that does something like
201:30 - that
201:31 - offset
201:32 - 20
201:34 - offset it so that it's like or rather
201:37 - let's first
201:38 - fill it
201:40 - uh
201:41 - let
201:43 - also 20
201:45 - millimeters
201:47 - why this fillet oh right flat enter air
201:50 - r
201:51 - enter
201:53 - let's not use 20 let's use 50
201:55 - millimeters
201:56 - in here and here
201:58 - like this and now i can offset
202:02 - uh by 20 millimeters
202:04 - outwards like that
202:07 - just kind of close off the pole line
202:09 - like so
202:10 - join everything up and now do a little
202:13 - bit of trimming so trim
202:16 - that
202:17 - and that
202:20 - then line
202:22 - um
202:23 - go lower
202:27 - trim
202:29 - come on trim
202:32 - enter
202:35 - there we go and you need to be
202:38 - also
202:40 - trimmed yeah
202:42 - uh so just you know awkward water tap
202:45 - with some big
202:47 - really big knob
202:49 - whatever
202:50 - okay so we have that that going on and
202:53 - that is fine
202:54 - that that looks okay
202:56 - and there is still sync and toilet that
202:59 - are left to do so i'll really quickly do
203:02 - it so for the sink i'm i'm thinking of
203:04 - having something like this
203:06 - um
203:08 - how wide is the sink i believe we used
203:10 - 400 right so it's going to be 400 mil
203:15 - here then it goes down by
203:18 - let's say
203:25 - 100 mil
203:26 - something like that
203:29 - and then it goes at an angle
203:31 - and that angle doesn't really matter
203:33 - right now so i'm just going to say
203:37 - something like that
203:39 - right that's it uh fill that
203:43 - uh flat corner or or just fill it
203:46 - radius
203:48 - uh
203:49 - 30
203:52 - just let those
203:53 - radii
203:55 - like that that's our sink where is my
203:58 - trusty
204:02 - app
204:03 - right there
204:05 - i'll just
204:07 - kinda rearrange the rearrange it scale
204:10 - this bad boy 0.5
204:14 - move
204:17 - to here
204:18 - and this
204:20 - trim this trims away
204:23 - tap
204:26 - good so that's our sink and then we have
204:28 - the last thing as our bowl and i will
204:30 - just take a look at the bowl how it
204:33 - looks like from the front
204:36 - uh that's ugly
204:38 - like a nicer one
204:43 - yeah that's good enough so it just goes
204:45 - kind of straight down well it does make
204:47 - a bend and it goes in a little bit um
204:50 - that's fine uh let's do it that way so
204:53 - i will create two guidelines
204:57 - here oh that's not uh how you want to do
205:00 - it
205:00 - guideline here guideline here how high
205:03 - are the bowls as well
205:06 - um 450.
205:09 - so they are 450 millimeters high that's
205:12 - that's good to know where's my autocad
205:15 - um
205:15 - [Music]
205:18 - how do we do this so
205:21 - there's going to be a line here it needs
205:23 - to go down and in okay so let's do an
205:26 - offset by how much it's going to kind of
205:28 - go in let's see by five centimeters
205:32 - like that like that
205:34 - now let's draw a line at the bottom at
205:36 - the base and let's offset it
205:39 - by 450 millimeters that's the top of the
205:42 - ball and let's offset it down by
205:46 - uh i don't know 150 millimeters
205:49 - this is uh from where it's going to kind
205:52 - of become
205:53 - thinner and now i just need to trace
205:56 - around so from here to here to here
205:59 - here
206:00 - here
206:01 - until here
206:03 - enter
206:04 - delete all of the
206:07 - guide
206:08 - lines
206:09 - like that that's our bowl
206:12 - yeah the proportion is fine i'll keep it
206:15 - that that's all we need to do and the
206:18 - flush
206:21 - the flesh button is located here uh now
206:24 - for the storage uh there is going to be
206:29 - um i i have made that that that cabinet
206:32 - in in the back of the bathroom so there
206:34 - is going to be storage involved here uh
206:37 - so i'll just draw a polyline from let's
206:39 - see the storage starts at the sink level
206:43 - so from here upwards um
206:46 - let's say for the toilet rolls
206:49 - the all of the
206:51 - you know
206:52 - [Music]
206:54 - stuff that you need at hand uh
206:57 - let's just give give it
206:59 - 300 millimeters
207:01 - something like that
207:03 - so this is going to be
207:04 - like open storage
207:06 - right this area so i'll just give it a
207:08 - frame of 50 millimeters
207:12 - just to show the frame oh that's uh 50
207:14 - is too much
207:15 - maybe let's not give it no i will give
207:18 - it a frame
207:19 - uh offset uh 18 millimeters that's the
207:22 - thickness of an mdf board
207:25 - uh like that we need to clean this up a
207:27 - bit
207:28 - trim
207:29 - [Music]
207:30 - no no
207:32 - there we go
207:33 - so that's storage and then above it we
207:35 - will have like three panels
207:37 - um i think we will have three panels
207:41 - let's do three panels so from this side
207:44 - we will offset
207:46 - um
207:48 - by how much by how much by how much
207:57 - if that's a meter then we can do
208:00 - 300 300 400 i think that's that's
208:03 - reasonable so let's do an offset
208:06 - of
208:07 - 300.
208:11 - centimeters or millimeters offset by 400
208:17 - millimeters
208:18 - something like that
208:20 - so that is kind of storage above the
208:24 - above the toilet
208:26 - done but
208:28 - that's enough that's enough i think we
208:30 - have the door we have the door we have
208:32 - the shelf here we have the retaining
208:35 - wall we have the partitioning wall
208:38 - window everything that we see here
208:40 - everything that we see here okay section
208:43 - is done
208:45 - let's learn one last thing and then we
208:48 - will call it a day
208:50 - so one last thing is hatch
208:53 - and by the way um
208:55 - for this section
208:56 - let's make the mark out a little bit
208:58 - nicer as well because it's a little bit
209:02 - you know
209:03 - um so let's make the mark out a little
209:04 - bit nicer
209:06 - usually
209:08 - there's no kind of convention for what
209:10 - kind of section markups to use
209:12 - the ones that the one that i really like
209:14 - using is
209:17 - a line segment that is i don't know uh
209:19 - in in this case it's going to be like uh
209:24 - 600 millimeters something like that
209:28 - it's kind of a line segment here
209:32 - then we have um
209:34 - then i offset it
209:37 - and i'll offset it by
209:39 - 300 millimeters
209:41 - no that is way too much i'm sorry i will
209:44 - offset it by a hundred millimeters
209:48 - yeah there we go that's much better and
209:51 - i will draw
209:53 - to the midpoint here
209:56 - this
209:58 - um this arrow and i'll just join up this
210:02 - arrow
210:03 - so now i i have a line and i have an
210:06 - arrow just like here line and arrow
210:08 - arrow is showing the viewing direction
210:10 - for this section and later i will add a
210:14 - text here or i can add text here now so
210:18 - the shortcut is text
210:20 - enter
210:21 - um you specify the start point here and
210:24 - you type in or
210:26 - you you specify the height of the text
210:29 - so what's the height what's the height
210:34 - i don't know
210:36 - [Music]
210:40 - let's do 200 for now and we will we will
210:43 - switch switch it up if it's too small so
210:45 - height is 200 enter
210:48 - and
210:49 - rotation angle of text 0 enter
210:52 - and now i can type in finally so
210:56 - next text text a
211:00 - that that's it
211:02 - escape uh
211:03 - we just drew we just wrote a
211:06 - right and i'm just going to kinda center
211:08 - it
211:12 - so
211:13 - one once i name this section it's going
211:16 - to be named section a dash a or a
211:20 - is that the dash it's probably a dash a
211:22 - a section a a
211:24 - and i will just place that section
211:26 - markup
211:27 - right here
211:29 - make a copy of it
211:34 - to the other side of the building
211:39 - very important to have section markups
211:43 - in your project please do so
211:47 - um right so that's text right add adding
211:50 - text that's nothing too fancy it's just
211:52 - basically you read what it asks you
211:55 - asks of you in the command line and
211:58 - you'll be good to go
212:01 - the text will need a separate layer so
212:03 - let me go to layer properties and let me
212:05 - create one more layer
212:07 - and i'll call it
212:08 - text
212:10 - right so that's going to be my text
212:12 - layer and my text is going to be yellow
212:15 - sure
212:16 - and then i'm going to create one more
212:18 - layer
212:19 - even more layers yes one more layer and
212:22 - call it hatch
212:24 - so hatch is basically fill right
212:27 - in in photoshop in illustrator you have
212:29 - phil in
212:31 - [Music]
212:32 - cad software you have hatch
212:35 - so hatch layer and i'll make it
212:40 - red green cn yellow
212:42 - pink
212:43 - or magenta all right so let's
212:46 - have a hatch layer with magenta color
212:49 - close that
212:51 - now i will take my markups
212:55 - and i'll place them in the text layer
212:57 - like so
212:59 - and now i will use hatch
213:02 - right
213:03 - to fill in the walls
213:05 - so i'll go to i'll make hatch layer my
213:08 - active one
213:10 - and i'll type in
213:11 - hatch
213:12 - or shortcut for it is just h
213:16 - enter so that's hatch
213:19 - and once i have typed it in it will give
213:21 - me the settings for the hatch of course
213:24 - where i can choose different
213:31 - patterns yes the word is pattern
213:33 - different patterns right
213:34 - uh and also like i can change the
213:36 - transparency the angle and so on so let
213:38 - me
213:40 - um let's let's do it this way let me
213:43 - create a rectangle
213:44 - like so
213:46 - and hatch it in
213:48 - right so
213:50 - if i just click inside of the rectangle
213:52 - and hit enter
213:54 - that's it it's hatched in right
213:56 - and this is
213:59 - it even has a pattern if i zoom in
214:01 - right and the pattern is super dense so
214:04 - it looks kind of filled in from from
214:07 - when i am zoomed out
214:09 - uh so that's a lot of bad things
214:10 - happening with the hash let me select
214:12 - the hatch and delete it
214:14 - let me also do
214:18 - a rectangle that is not closed
214:21 - right
214:22 - there's a gap here
214:24 - hatch
214:26 - click cannot be
214:29 - determined right can a hatch cannot be
214:31 - made close
214:33 - shows me even where
214:35 - so it only works with stuff that is
214:38 - closed off right
214:39 - uh can you go away please
214:44 - oh my god now now i'm gonna
214:47 - anyway let's ignore those two circles
214:49 - here um so it only works with enclosed
214:52 - uh boundaries uh that's the first thing
214:55 - the second thing it uh
214:58 - the scaling is very important and it it
215:00 - does become super heavy if you have a
215:02 - pattern for the hatch but your
215:05 - scaling is so small
215:07 - that it looks like a solid and you think
215:09 - that you have a solid hash like a solid
215:11 - fill but it's actually a very very tiny
215:13 - pattern your computer will get super
215:16 - slow because of that
215:17 - so let me do hatch again
215:21 - and here i can choose a pattern right so
215:24 - the solid patterns just basically fill
215:26 - in right it's just filling in then you
215:29 - have the angled patterns and you have a
215:31 - bunch of them actually is it possible
215:33 - for me yeah so i can click on that small
215:36 - icon there and i can see all of the
215:38 - patterns that i can choose from
215:40 - oh my god so
215:42 - so bad um
215:44 - so let's not look at the bad patterns
215:47 - let's just talk about these what you
215:49 - have here so hatch patterns usually
215:51 - determine the material that you're
215:53 - cutting through and if it's a solid
215:55 - hatch it's usually you saying that
215:59 - don't worry about the material for now
216:01 - this is just a proposal entry uh project
216:03 - and the material doesn't matter right
216:06 - but if you
216:07 - later
216:08 - layer down the line if you want to kind
216:11 - of add materiality to your drawings
216:13 - explaining that oh this is concrete
216:15 - while this is wood while this is steel
216:17 - then you use hatches different hatches
216:19 - that determine it so
216:22 - the regular angled hatch
216:25 - this one where i have my mouse
216:27 - is
216:28 - concrete usually
216:30 - right it's concrete
216:32 - then the one
216:34 - right next to it the one with the double
216:36 - line
216:37 - uh
216:38 - well okay
216:40 - the tricky thing is that it changes
216:43 - between country to country right the the
216:45 - regulations uh change between country to
216:47 - country but
216:50 - to my knowledge most of the countries
216:51 - use this as steel
216:53 - metal right so that's the hatch for
216:55 - metal
216:56 - and the third one is hatch for wood
216:59 - right
217:00 - so that is uh three main hatches that
217:02 - you
217:03 - kind of go through once you introduce
217:05 - materiality for now i'm just going to
217:08 - use solid hatch well actually i do need
217:10 - to talk about scaling solid hatch
217:12 - doesn't have any scaling because it's
217:14 - solid right it's filled in while these
217:16 - do
217:17 - so you can change the density of the
217:19 - hatch
217:20 - so let's let's talk about this let's
217:22 - let's choose concrete right the the
217:24 - regular angled hedge
217:27 - once i have this chosen
217:29 - and i hover my mouse over the rectangle
217:31 - i
217:32 - see it as solid but if i zoom in
217:36 - it is still solid no it's not
217:39 - there we go it's it's all messed up
217:40 - right it's it's super super dense so the
217:43 - first thing that i want to do is i want
217:45 - to change the density and the density is
217:47 - changed right here
217:49 - patch pattern scale right if i change
217:52 - the scale to 100
217:55 - enter
217:57 - and i hover my mouse over the rectangle
217:59 - now you can see that the hatch has a
218:01 - hundred times larger scale and that is
218:04 - actually too big
218:06 - so let's do 50.
218:09 - yeah that's fine um just to show you you
218:12 - know so that's 50.
218:14 - then you have uh
218:16 - possibility to change the angle so this
218:19 - is uh
218:21 - you know the default hatch what if i
218:23 - wanted just horizontal well i just
218:25 - changed the angle to 45
218:28 - well that's vertical but you get the
218:29 - idea right so
218:32 - minus 45 would be
218:34 - horizontal
218:36 - right
218:38 - so that is how you change the rotation
218:40 - of the hatch uh super useful uh for now
218:43 - i will keep it at zero and the default
218:45 - value for the hash is zero degrees then
218:48 - you have transparency don't mess around
218:49 - with transparency ignore the
218:50 - transparency
218:52 - uh there's one more thing and that is uh
218:56 - one more
218:57 - useful thing and that is set origin
219:01 - and it's basically if i
219:03 - let me just create this hatch and then
219:06 - click on it once once once it's created
219:10 - and i click on it it will
219:12 - give me the hash editor tab again right
219:15 - as if i was editing it
219:17 - and now i can change the origin right so
219:23 - this is a point
219:25 - from which the from which
219:27 - autocad starts hatching your geometry
219:30 - right so if i click on this set origin
219:32 - now and i choose let's say
219:35 - this point right here right
219:38 - the hatch will be aligned with that
219:42 - particular point so when you need
219:44 - something precise in terms of how it's
219:46 - hatched that set origin point is a
219:49 - lifesaver for sure
219:52 - that's about it in terms of hatching so
219:54 - now let's hatch our
219:56 - our buildings
219:58 - catch
219:59 - enter
220:01 - i will actually use the angled hatch why
220:04 - not
220:06 - and i will just be
220:07 - clicking inside
220:10 - of
220:12 - the
220:13 - walls
220:15 - because that's the stuff that we cut
220:17 - through right
220:18 - uh i could be hatching inside of the
220:22 - frames window frames but that's not no
220:25 - way too small no need to hatch those
220:28 - uh so that's that's the walls that are
220:30 - done enter
220:34 - and actually the hatch is pretty big
220:36 - pretty coarse so what i can do is i can
220:39 - just select it
220:41 - go back here
220:42 - to hatch editor and then just change the
220:46 - the density to like 20 maybe yeah 20 is
220:50 - nicer that is now hatch then and let's
220:53 - do the same thing with the ground
220:55 - because i want the ground to be hatched
220:57 - in as well uh so i'm just going to
220:59 - create a temporary polyline here
221:03 - maybe
221:04 - a little bit
221:05 - smaller
221:07 - maybe just goes
221:09 - from here to here
221:12 - something like
221:15 - that
221:19 - maybe a little bit longer there this is
221:21 - just uh
221:24 - you don't need
221:25 - you don't need to be precise with this
221:28 - um
221:30 - just hatching out the hatching in the
221:32 - ground so it's something like this and
221:34 - then i will
221:36 - start from
221:38 - my pole line start there
221:40 - just make a horizontal line and just use
221:42 - fillet
221:44 - with radius of zero
221:47 - to kind of let these two guys together
221:50 - so now i have a closed ball line and i
221:51 - will hatch
221:54 - and i will place a hatch inside and i
221:56 - will change change it to a different
221:58 - kind of a
222:00 - different kind of a pattern
222:02 - i'm just thinking what kind of pattern
222:04 - should i use maybe i'll still use the
222:06 - angled one but i will change the angle
222:08 - to 45 degrees
222:10 - something like that and i will change
222:12 - the density to
222:14 - 30
222:15 - something like that
222:17 - that should be good enough
222:19 - and now i don't need that border anymore
222:21 - so i'll just delete it just to have the
222:23 - hatch right
222:27 - okay
222:29 - i think that is that is it
222:32 - can i check
222:34 - i will just check the notes
222:39 - uh just give me a second
222:45 - [Music]
222:50 - array uh next time
222:53 - arrays whatever uh not important
222:56 - text oh i already showed you text that's
222:58 - good uh less things to show you tomorrow
223:02 - um
223:03 - that's fine
223:07 - yeah uh so so that's good uh everything
223:10 - that i wanted to show today is shown
223:13 - tomorrow we will work on the axonometry
223:16 - and we will finish up the project right
223:20 - so that's that
223:21 - go to work
223:22 - and enjoy the process
223:25 - there
223:26 - bye
223:28 - hello hello
223:29 - and welcome to the last part of the
223:31 - autocad series
223:33 - where i'm going to
223:35 - and finish up this project and show you
223:37 - all of the remaining tools that we kind
223:40 - of need to use to be able to finish up
223:43 - so right now we have a plan we have a
223:46 - section
223:48 - those still need some some work and
223:50 - those stills need some additional
223:52 - information but most of the stuff that
223:54 - we want is already there
223:57 - the thing that's missing
223:59 - is the axonometry drawing so i'm going
224:02 - to do exactly that right now and then we
224:05 - will continue on with adding additional
224:07 - information and
224:08 - basically extracting the drawings into a
224:11 - pdf
224:12 - so
224:14 - to start off um axonometry or
224:17 - isometric view is basically a view from
224:22 - the
224:22 - top
224:24 - sometimes it's from three quarters of
224:26 - the top but
224:27 - uh in this case we're just going to be
224:29 - using some
224:31 - weird angles i guess and a very fast
224:34 - example would be if i have a rectangle
224:37 - and i'll just draw it completely
224:39 - randomly
224:41 - just some sort of random sized rectangle
224:43 - and let me switch to thick line
224:46 - just so that
224:48 - we're kind of consistent
224:50 - um let's see this rectangle represents
224:53 - the top of our
224:55 - shape of our box right so if we look at
224:58 - the box from the top it's a rectangle
225:00 - right so what if i want to show an
225:04 - isonometric view of it well first thing
225:06 - that i do is i check
225:08 - uh what kind of angles i can use so i
225:11 - can use 45 to 45 degree angles for the
225:14 - walls or i can use 60 to 30 degrees
225:17 - that's that's usually the
225:19 - typically that's the angles that you use
225:21 - so i will show you both of them in
225:24 - uh
225:27 - yeah i'll just show you both of those
225:29 - variations
225:31 - so
225:32 - basically for 45 degree angles you can't
225:35 - really do
225:39 - like drawing them with uh
225:42 - without any
225:44 - assistance is kind of tricky well it's
225:46 - not tricky it's just that you first need
225:49 - to draw it horizontally right some sort
225:51 - of line and then you need to rotate it
225:54 - every time
225:58 - by minus 45
226:00 - well that's the other way around but but
226:03 - you get what i mean you know to get a 45
226:05 - degree angle you just kind of draw the
226:07 - line horizontally and you rotate it
226:09 - that's not nice instead what we can do
226:13 - is we can use this polar
226:15 - uh tracking
226:17 - widget right here
226:19 - in the bottom
226:21 - it's f10 the shortcut is f10
226:23 - so i will enable it by clicking on it
226:26 - and also we can expand it and we can see
226:30 - so you can expand it by clicking this
226:32 - small
226:33 - triangular icon right here and once you
226:36 - expand it you can see the angles that
226:39 - it's going to
226:41 - let you choose right so it's basically
226:43 - in increments so you can have like 90
226:45 - degree uh increments you can have 45
226:48 - degree increments 30 degree increments
226:51 - 25.5 degree increments and so on so
226:54 - for
226:55 - an axo that is 45 to 45 degrees i can
226:59 - use this 45 degree increment
227:01 - um
227:03 - color tracking is it called yeah polar
227:05 - tracking
227:06 - so i will enable that so now this is
227:08 - tick marked
227:10 - and now when i draw a line
227:14 - it snaps
227:16 - to a direction of 45 degrees which is
227:19 - great so now let's draw uh this this box
227:23 - uh
227:24 - in an axle to do that i need to know
227:27 - these two measurements so i'll just
227:29 - measure distance
227:30 - this
227:33 - like that and it's around uh
227:35 - i drew the box very
227:38 - randomly so
227:40 - i will just say that it's around six ten
227:42 - six thousand millimeters right so then i
227:45 - just grab a polyline or a line tool
227:47 - doesn't matter i'll just draw it at 45
227:49 - degree angles
227:51 - as 6000 enter
227:55 - so that's my line right
227:57 - then i will measure the other wall
228:00 - like so
228:03 - and i see that it's
228:05 - 3251. so let's say
228:07 - 3250 millimeters
228:10 - i'll grab a polyline tool again
228:12 - i'll just draw it out yeah like so
228:16 - 3 500
228:18 - 3250 right enter
228:22 - that's it we have the two lines and that
228:25 - these two lines are going to be enough
228:27 - for me to finish up
228:29 - drawing this this particular
228:32 - this particular box
228:34 - because now what i can do is i can copy
228:39 - this line
228:40 - from from its base point here to the
228:42 - base point here and i can you can see
228:44 - that i missed so i'll do that again
228:47 - select it copy
228:50 - from here
228:52 - to
228:53 - here
228:54 - there we go that's much better and then
228:56 - i will
228:57 - i will select the
228:59 - other line copy
229:01 - from its base point here
229:05 - to the base point here
229:08 - that's about it right now now we have
229:10 - our
229:12 - um
229:13 - 45
229:15 - degree angle axle off the
229:18 - top of the box but of course in an
229:20 - axonometry you can see it as a
229:22 - three-dimensional um three-dimensional
229:25 - object so let's see the
229:27 - height of this box is three meters three
229:29 - thousand millimeters so what i like
229:31 - doing is i like selecting the let's say
229:33 - this is the roof right i like selecting
229:35 - the roof plane
229:37 - and copying it copy
229:40 - and i'll just copy it from top to bottom
229:43 - like so and i'll just type in 3 000
229:46 - millimeters
229:47 - right and hit escape so then i have the
229:50 - bottom of the box as well now all i need
229:53 - to do is just some additional lines for
229:55 - verticals
229:57 - and clean it up right so i'll just draw
229:59 - those slides
230:01 - like so
230:04 - like so
230:06 - and like so and then trim
230:09 - enter enter
230:11 - and get rid of everything that we
230:14 - don't need don't need that
230:16 - don't need that that's it
230:19 - that's the 45 degree
230:21 - axle right
230:23 - 30 60 degree axle
230:25 - uh or iso view would look like this well
230:28 - first of all i need to
230:30 - change the polar snapping polar tracking
230:33 - to
230:34 - 30 degree increments of course
230:37 - and then i kind of do the same thing so
230:39 - i remember that this is 60
230:41 - or
230:42 - 60. this is 6 000
230:44 - millimeters and this is 3250 millimeters
230:48 - so let me do this um
230:51 - i will find
230:52 - a 30 degree angle right here and i'll
230:55 - say 6 000
230:56 - like so
230:58 - i will
230:59 - then find the 60 degree angle here and i
231:02 - i'll say 3250
231:06 - like so
231:07 - and actually i can kind of continue
231:09 - drawing it this way or yeah let's let's
231:12 - stick to it i'll i'll copy
231:15 - right so the procedure is exactly the
231:17 - same
231:18 - copy
231:20 - like that
231:24 - it the height doesn't change of course
231:26 - 3000
231:27 - like that
231:32 - accidentally moved it i guess in the
231:35 - incorrect way
231:36 - copy
231:38 - please move downwards 3000 enter
231:42 - yeah now it's good
231:44 - three lines
231:46 - bam
231:48 - bam
231:50 - bam
231:52 - those three lines are done and now
231:55 - or
231:56 - just trim enter enter
231:59 - get rid of that
232:01 - get rid of that
232:02 - and delete those two
232:04 - there we go so that's a 30 60 degree
232:07 - angle right
232:08 - very simple let's do this with our
232:11 - with our building
232:13 - um
232:14 - so i will say that i wanna
232:17 - i wanna kind of look at it
232:20 - maybe from this point on i don't know
232:26 - well if we look at it from this point on
232:28 - it's it's going to be the
232:30 - the large roof and then the small roof
232:33 - maybe that's fine
232:37 - or maybe we can yeah let's look at it
232:39 - actually from
232:40 - [Music]
232:42 - from here from this point right
232:46 - like so
232:47 - so i will
232:49 - measure
232:50 - distance
232:51 - and i'll do it 30 60. i'll measure
232:55 - distance so that's 6 000 millimeters in
232:57 - length
232:59 - and of course the width is going to be 4
233:01 - 000 millimeters
233:04 - like that or thousand
233:05 - so
233:06 - i will just grab a polyline tool and
233:09 - just draw it out like so
233:12 - and i'll see
233:13 - 6 000
233:14 - in this length
233:19 - there we
233:20 - go
233:22 - 4000
233:24 - along this line
233:26 - so
233:28 - make a copy
233:32 - bam
233:34 - and make
233:36 - and and then basically close it off
233:38 - right so let's say this is like the
233:41 - footprint of of my building right so
233:43 - this is
233:44 - uh this edge right here around my
233:47 - building then i need to know the height
233:51 - uh the height of it and here i kind of
233:53 - have um
233:57 - how do we do this
233:59 - yeah let's uh draw it from the ground
234:01 - yeah that makes sense
234:03 - so i'll i'll do distance
234:10 - sorry about this um i do want to
234:13 - actually
234:14 - select this
234:15 - join this up
234:17 - right and i want to first take the floor
234:20 - slab and move it up to the correct
234:23 - height
234:24 - right
234:25 - just like i did with the box
234:27 - in the case of the box i moved it down
234:29 - in this case i'm moving it up it's the
234:31 - same procedure basically so i'll just
234:34 - measure distance
234:36 - uh from here
234:39 - to the top here and i can see the
234:41 - distance is 3500 right so i'll just take
234:44 - this copy
234:46 - up
234:48 - 3500
234:50 - like that
234:52 - and then
234:53 - i'm going to measure distance here
234:56 - distance
234:59 - from here to here
235:01 - that is two thousand eight hundred right
235:03 - so i'm just going to make another copy
235:07 - up
235:08 - two thousand two thousand eight hundred
235:11 - there we go right so now i have all of
235:14 - the levels that i that i will need for
235:16 - my axle and i can start connecting them
235:19 - um before i begin
235:21 - that hiccup right here i need to know
235:24 - where that hiccup happens right the
235:27 - change in the height so i'll measure
235:29 - distance again
235:30 - from here to here 2560.
235:34 - okay
235:35 - sure so along this line
235:38 - if i grab a polyline tool along this
235:40 - line is going to be 2
235:43 - 560
235:45 - millimeters
235:46 - enter
235:48 - and actually let me extend it so i just
235:51 - have this polyline as a helper and i
235:53 - know that this point oh
235:55 - messed it up
235:57 - let's do this again two five six zero
235:59 - right or two six five zero oh my god uh
236:06 - distance
236:07 - two five six zero okay
236:11 - from here
236:13 - to here two five six zero
236:18 - uh come on
236:19 - come on just
236:21 - two five six zero enter
236:24 - did you snap properly this time yes you
236:26 - did okay good
236:28 - always double double check if it's if if
236:31 - it is snapping properly
236:33 - so i have that point here and now i can
236:36 - just draw that point up
236:39 - draw a line from that point up
236:41 - the height of the line doesn't matter
236:43 - because i can just always
236:45 - select things that i don't need so for
236:47 - instance i don't need this anymore and i
236:49 - can delete it and i can also trim enter
236:52 - enter and trim away the excess right
236:55 - so i have basically what i've done is i
236:58 - created this hiccup line right here and
237:01 - i know that with this hiccup line the
237:04 - top of the roof ends that the highest
237:06 - roof it ends so i'll just grab a
237:09 - polyline tool and i'll just draw it out
237:11 - like so
237:16 - or i could just take this line and copy
237:18 - it
237:19 - that that works as well
237:21 - okay so now it
237:23 - it doesn't look like much but once i
237:25 - start cleaning it up
237:26 - it will start taking shape so i'll do
237:29 - exactly that i'll trim and i'll trim
237:31 - away
237:32 - um enter
237:34 - this area right here
237:38 - is this
237:39 - this
237:40 - and also this
237:42 - right
237:43 - so that now is the top of my uh the top
237:46 - of my roof
237:48 - and that is the bottom of my roof
237:51 - and i can basically connect everything
237:54 - with vertical lines so there's going to
237:56 - be a vertical line here
237:58 - there's going to be a vertical line here
238:03 - and the vertical line here that's that's
238:05 - all i need to do and now it's just uh
238:07 - cleaning it cleaning everything up right
238:09 - so trim again enter enter and get rid of
238:13 - all of the necessary bits
238:17 - construction workers
238:19 - behind the
238:20 - glass hope you don't hear them
238:25 - let's do that
238:27 - all of the unnecessary bits and pieces
238:30 - that we don't need we just trim away and
238:32 - i can see that i can just delete that
238:34 - zigzag here so i'll just kind of delete
238:36 - it
238:38 - right
238:39 - so that's the shape that's the shape of
238:41 - of
238:44 - the beautiful building
238:45 - right
238:48 - wonderful
238:49 - um let's continue
238:52 - so what i want to add now is this
238:58 - well that's actually a very boring
239:00 - facade
239:05 - let me do this real fast
239:08 - let's grab a grab
239:10 - this copy
239:18 - rotate
239:23 - come on
239:24 - rotate
239:26 - and just
239:28 - create some sort of opening at least
239:31 - right right
239:32 - somewhere here and then of course i need
239:34 - to clean this up so i'm just going to
239:36 - make
239:37 - i'm just going to hide the medium lines
239:40 - for now or rather first i'll create two
239:42 - thick lines here
239:44 - here and here
239:48 - um
239:48 - [Music]
239:50 - turn
239:51 - off the medium layer select these two
239:54 - lines trim
239:58 - lead delete
240:00 - join everything up here and also join
240:03 - this
240:04 - join
240:05 - okay this is closed this is closed
240:07 - perfect
240:08 - okay so now we can
240:10 - we can actually
240:11 - turn on the medium layer and now we have
240:15 - additional window here which will not
240:17 - show up in the section but we we don't
240:19 - care
240:20 - um
240:21 - i deleted the hatch so i'll reinstate
240:23 - the hatch
240:24 - hatch
240:26 - um that's going to be that pattern the i
240:29 - believe i used 20 for the scale
240:33 - yeah looks like it i'll just click
240:35 - inside of the walls where i want the
240:37 - hatch to be
240:40 - there we go that is done
240:42 - enter
240:44 - okay so we do have a window here now so
240:46 - it's not going to be that boring at
240:48 - least
240:50 - i kind of want to now
240:53 - cut a hole out for this window and also
240:55 - of course for this window so the first
240:58 - thing is i
240:59 - need to
241:01 - know what's the height at which the
241:03 - windows are going to be located and
241:05 - actually both of their height is going
241:07 - to be the same it's going to be
241:11 - one one five zero millimeters above
241:14 - the ground line this this line right
241:16 - here so i'm just going to take this
241:18 - polyline
241:19 - i'll copy it
241:21 - up
241:23 - by one one five zero enter
241:30 - okay so that is the bottom of the window
241:33 - and at top of the window i can just
241:36 - measure the distance again
241:39 - so my window height is 1.2 meters
241:43 - so i'll just take this line again copy
241:47 - up
241:49 - one two zero zero enter
241:52 - right that's the top of my of my windows
241:56 - now i need to know where this edge is
241:59 - and also where this edge is right so
242:02 - i'll just measure distance
242:04 - from the
242:05 - end of the wall
242:07 - one five four zero
242:09 - and then it's going to be another
242:12 - one of nine nine hundred one five four
242:16 - zero nine hundred okay
242:19 - let's do it this way a line along this
242:22 - line
242:23 - to make sure that you're just drawing a
242:24 - polyline in in that
242:27 - particular direction
242:29 - and one five four zero
242:31 - we're doing one five four zero here and
242:34 - just
242:35 - honestly just drag it out
242:37 - you know
242:39 - so so basically we have this kind of l
242:41 - shape i i like using it this way
242:45 - um as as my helper lines actually i
242:48 - should probably
242:49 - like have these lines just to be more
242:51 - pedagogical in the helper
242:54 - layer because these are just my
242:57 - helper lines and i'll make my helper
242:59 - layer active as well
243:01 - we continue
243:02 - i just grab this uh i start drawing from
243:05 - this point along this direction
243:08 - and i will say 900 because that's the
243:11 - width of my window
243:14 - like so
243:16 - right
243:18 - like so so this rectangle right here is
243:21 - where my window is going to be located
243:24 - in the axle same thing for here but for
243:27 - here it's going to be quite simple i
243:29 - just measure the distance
243:31 - from here to here that's 400 of course
243:34 - and i can just take this
243:36 - vertical line here and just make a copy
243:38 - of it
243:40 - along this edge so i'll just snap
243:43 - somewhere to this edge and type in 400
243:47 - and that makes it into
243:50 - makes it into a copy
243:52 - okay let's uh
243:54 - clean this up again right so
243:57 - i will just grab the thick line tool and
244:00 - i'll just grab a polyline tool and here
244:02 - uh
244:03 - just make sure that intersection
244:05 - snapping is turned on
244:08 - intersection that it's turned on and i
244:11 - will
244:13 - and i will just draw out this
244:15 - twisted rectangle here or project that
244:18 - rectangle here
244:19 - that's the hole for my window and i'll
244:22 - do the same thing here only that it's a
244:24 - corner window so it's going to be a u
244:27 - shape rather than a rectangle
244:31 - like that this
244:33 - right and now i don't need the helper
244:34 - lines anymore so i just delete them
244:39 - there we go
244:41 - this line right here uh line segment
244:43 - right here is not necessary so i'll just
244:46 - trim enter enter
244:48 - and trim it away
244:51 - okay
244:52 - so now to be
244:55 - pedagogical
244:56 - i need to give thickness to this right
244:59 - of course i i need to give
245:01 - oh
245:02 - by the way if you do this
245:05 - accidentally like if you accidentally
245:07 - rotate the
245:09 - view just click on the
245:11 - top
245:12 - top right
245:14 - corner box right here and then click on
245:17 - the arrow keys like here to rotate it
245:21 - back so that stop is
245:24 - you know
245:25 - where you want it to be
245:27 - um right
245:29 - continuing on thickness so
245:32 - to give it thickness all i need to do is
245:34 - just draw out a line segment here of
245:36 - course and as you can see i always
245:40 - tend to draw out line segments that are
245:42 - too thick and then i just simply trim it
245:45 - trim them back to to the thickness that
245:48 - i want
245:49 - right
245:50 - um and the thickness of the wall is 400
245:54 - millimeters i don't even need to check
245:55 - that so i know that this line will go in
246:00 - by
246:01 - 400
246:02 - well actually what we can do
246:05 - now let's do it the old-fashioned way
246:08 - um
246:10 - copy or offset offset would work as well
246:13 - offset 400
246:17 - from here to here that's 400 and then
246:20 - draw just a line segment here
246:23 - offset that line segment
246:26 - by 400
246:28 - and words like so
246:30 - and delete the original of course
246:33 - um
246:34 - trimming again
246:38 - enter
246:39 - there we go there we go there we go
246:43 - okay so that is thickness of the wall
246:46 - uh here and there's also going to be
246:48 - thickness of the wall here but
246:50 - in in this case i'm going to be a little
246:53 - i keep
246:54 - holding down the shift key sorry about
246:56 - that
246:57 - um
246:58 - don't hold the shift key as you're
247:00 - scrolling it's going to rotate the view
247:03 - uh so in this case i'm just going to
247:04 - grab a polyline tool draw this l shape
247:07 - right here
247:10 - take that l shape and move it
247:13 - along
247:16 - along the 30 degree direction right
247:20 - by 400 millimeters
247:22 - like so
247:25 - trim enter enter
247:28 - trim away
247:29 - the excess
247:31 - grab the polyline tool
247:33 - extend it you have your opening here
247:37 - right
247:38 - okay so there's no windows
247:40 - uh let's add windows of course so the
247:43 - windows are gonna
247:45 - keep doing it
247:47 - um the windows are going to be
247:50 - located
247:51 - let's see in the middle or or actually
247:55 - do i want them in the middle
247:57 - maybe i do
247:59 - let's say the windows are going to be
248:00 - located kinda in the middle of the
248:05 - of the wall right so i'm just going to
248:07 - take
248:08 - um
248:09 - this polyline that i already have and
248:11 - i'll copy it from this corner
248:14 - to the middle corner here and that is
248:17 - going to be my initial
248:20 - window
248:22 - or window plane right
248:25 - then i will offset
248:29 - by 50 because i remember that my
248:31 - thickness of the window frame is 50
248:34 - millimeters
248:35 - offset it like
248:37 - offset it by 50
248:40 - and just
248:41 - copy it inwards
248:45 - by
248:47 - i don't know
248:53 - 25
248:54 - 25
248:57 - something like that and now it's just a
248:59 - bunch of cleaning up right so the more
249:02 - curves you have the
249:03 - more you need to think what you're
249:05 - cleaning
249:06 - uh but it's basically going to be if i
249:09 - trim
249:10 - enter of course i don't see anything
249:13 - that's going on here
249:16 - that's gone
249:17 - um i will not through the window
249:19 - technically you since it's glass you
249:21 - would see that the back side of the wall
249:24 - but in this case we don't want to show
249:27 - it so i'm not going to be showing it
249:30 - and that is basically it
249:33 - then i just delete the access
249:35 - and then we have
249:37 - wall
249:39 - window frame
249:40 - and glass
249:42 - right
249:44 - so we have our window here same thing
249:46 - for this
249:50 - uh same thing for this bad boy right
249:52 - here
249:53 - why am i doing this i think this is
249:55 - because in rhino the the shortcut is
249:58 - holding down the shift key to pan the
250:00 - view
250:01 - so i think that's why i'm doing it
250:04 - anyway
250:05 - um
250:06 - in this case it's exactly exactly the
250:09 - same procedure
250:10 - only that i'm going to
250:12 - draw a polyline
250:15 - like so
250:20 - let me make it make it white uh helper
250:24 - line
250:25 - layer so i'll just
250:27 - draw it as a white pollen so that it's
250:29 - easier for you to see
250:31 - make a polyline
250:33 - pop it in
250:35 - and i will just make a copy of it or
250:37 - rather i can just move it actually move
250:40 - it
250:42 - inside
250:44 - of the hole
250:45 - by
250:47 - uh
250:49 - so that's going to be middle of the wall
250:52 - that will need to be 400
250:56 - um
251:00 - no
251:01 - the wall thickness is 400 so that's
251:03 - going to be 200 millimeters
251:05 - something like that so now it's moved in
251:08 - and of course it makes a bend here right
251:11 - so i can't have that line
251:13 - just located here it needs to go in
251:17 - and
251:18 - the way is going to go in like the way
251:20 - i'm going to find that point uh by how
251:23 - much this edge needs to go in
251:26 - i'm talking about
251:28 - this corner and this frame right here
251:30 - see how it's it's going in it's not you
251:32 - know resting on the side of the wall uh
251:36 - same thing here it can't rest on this
251:37 - side of the wall it needs to go in so i
251:40 - am going to just grab this
251:43 - line
251:44 - right here and i will make an offset of
251:47 - it by 200
251:51 - inwards so now i can see
251:54 - the
251:54 - the new
251:56 - um
251:57 - the new line segment
251:59 - that i can draw and i'll draw it of
252:01 - course
252:02 - so helper apollo line
252:05 - from here
252:06 - upwards
252:07 - it's like that
252:09 - we need to clean it up
252:11 - because the more again the more curves
252:13 - you have the
252:15 - uh the harder it is for you to
252:16 - understand what the hell is going on
252:19 - so i'm going to delete all of the
252:20 - unnecessary bits
252:22 - um and i'm
252:24 - going to rotate the view as per usual
252:27 - i'm going to
252:28 - trim enter
252:31 - enter and i'm going to trim away the
252:33 - things that i don't need so that
252:36 - and i'm going to join
252:38 - things that i do need
252:42 - a second
252:49 - yeah
252:50 - um
252:52 - right so so now i have it offsetted
252:56 - offsetted uh by 200 inwards and that is
253:00 - great it makes a bend but we will never
253:02 - see that bend that it makes so we are
253:05 - just dealing with this plane here
253:08 - i will offset it now i'm just doing the
253:10 - same thing as i'm i was doing here
253:12 - offset 50
253:15 - hello
253:16 - oh
253:16 - offset 50
253:19 - there we go
253:21 - you go in
253:22 - then take this
253:24 - copy
253:27 - along this direction
253:29 - by 25
253:31 - and then just draw that small little
253:34 - line right there for the frame
253:38 - um
253:39 - right
253:40 - now we
253:41 - clean everything up as per usual trim
253:43 - trim
253:46 - bam bam
253:50 - um
253:51 - no need for that delete
253:53 - okay
253:55 - so that's oh uh
253:57 - forgot that part
253:59 - trim
254:01 - bam bam
254:03 - now that's fine okay um so i have this
254:06 - done there's also uh i forgot one thing
254:10 - we have two partitions
254:12 - that's oops
254:15 - that's my bad
254:16 - so the way i'm going to do partitions i
254:18 - think
254:20 - is do we measure from the side of the
254:24 - wall yeah maybe maybe we just measure
254:26 - from the side of the wall right
254:30 - or is that a stupid way to do it
254:33 - maybe it is a stupid way to do it
254:39 - i know
254:40 - let's do it this way i'll draw two
254:42 - helper lines here
254:45 - right here
254:47 - and right here and i will measure their
254:50 - distances
254:51 - from this corner from where the window
254:53 - starts distance to this line
254:56 - is going to be
254:58 - 1100
255:00 - and then another distance is going to be
255:04 - 3275
255:11 - one one zero zero two two seven five
255:14 - okay i just need to
255:16 - i am sure that i will forget that
255:19 - uh so then what i can do is i can just
255:21 - draw a polyline from here
255:24 - like so
255:26 - um
255:27 - 1 1 0 0
255:29 - like that so that's a point
255:31 - right here
255:32 - and let me actually mark it out just
255:34 - with a random line here
255:36 - and then another one is going to be
255:41 - uh
255:42 - yep forgot it two two seven five there
255:44 - we go
255:45 - two two seven five
255:50 - enter
255:51 - so it goes until here and i'll just draw
255:53 - it out like so so i have like these two
255:55 - two corner points and i know that if i
255:58 - were to make like an extension for the
256:00 - frame it would reach those two corner
256:03 - points so i can kind of backtrack right
256:05 - i can kind of do this i can grab a
256:08 - polyline
256:09 - and i can draw it
256:12 - like so
256:15 - please stop
256:17 - stop rotating
256:19 - okay follow line like so
256:22 - and another one like so
256:24 - right so so now i have anchored my my
256:27 - lines properly and now all i need to
256:29 - deal with is just vertical lines right
256:33 - so i'll just grab a polyline again and
256:35 - i'll just draw out
256:36 - i just need to make sure that i'm
256:38 - sticking to the correct position yeah
256:40 - there we go i'll just draw draw out
256:42 - vertical polylines here or vertical line
256:45 - segments and here
256:47 - right
256:48 - now i don't need those helpers anymore
256:50 - so i'll just delete them so that they're
256:52 - not in the way anymore
256:54 - like that
256:56 - and for these line segments i can
256:58 - actually
257:00 - clean them up a little bit more
257:02 - from come on
257:04 - trim enter enter
257:06 - bam bam i can clean them up a little bit
257:10 - more and i can start messing around with
257:12 - them so moving them around copy
257:17 - so you too will be copied enter and you
257:20 - will be copied along this direction
257:23 - by 50 millimeters right because that's
257:27 - that's the thickness of the polar line
257:30 - right
257:31 - um or
257:32 - polyline not the polygon of of the frame
257:34 - so i i drew this
257:36 - this line right here and then i copied
257:39 - it by 50 millimeters
257:41 - i don't need those helpers anymore
257:46 - okay so we have that done um and now i
257:48 - will just take these two line segments
257:50 - and i will copy them in by
257:53 - 25 millimeters for this thickness right
257:55 - here only that we will see it on the
257:57 - side copy
258:00 - along this direction
258:02 - 25 mil
258:03 - that's done okay time to clean it up and
258:06 - make it actually look like a proper
258:09 - proper window uh trim enter
258:12 - enter
258:14 - and now it's just a bunch of trimming
258:16 - here
258:18 - so the frame will merge
258:20 - so the frame kind of does this right it
258:23 - just merges
258:26 - um like so and of course you don't see
258:28 - anything behind the frame
258:31 - here as well you don't see anything
258:33 - behind the frame
258:35 - merges here
258:37 - um
258:40 - continues on here like that
258:44 - okay that's good and let's clean this up
258:48 - that's good
258:50 - and there are two line segments that are
258:51 - missing
258:53 - where the frame bends like here and also
258:58 - right here
259:00 - oh yeah and we don't need to see the
259:02 - inner line of the wall anymore so we can
259:05 - just delete that
259:08 - oh that that as well
259:11 - that's it that's that is our
259:13 - window in the axle right
259:17 - i will change everything to medium layer
259:21 - uh just because
259:23 - we are not cutting through anything so
259:24 - it makes sense that it is a medium layer
259:27 - except that for the glass i will change
259:31 - the glass to thin
259:33 - thin layer because there's too many
259:35 - too many lines
259:37 - that are concentrated
259:39 - uh in in one spot so i don't want them
259:42 - to merge like graphically i don't want
259:44 - them to merge into one thick line so i'm
259:47 - going to make the glass
259:49 - thin layer
259:51 - okay
259:52 - um
259:53 - now it's all about hatching it right and
259:57 - making it nicer
259:59 - um
260:01 - it's not a very difficult building
260:03 - that's for sure
260:04 - um
260:06 - let me just add the hatch and then we
260:07 - will continue i don't want to spend too
260:09 - much time here
260:11 - so i want to have
260:13 - planks let's see
260:15 - horizontal planks going around the
260:16 - building so i will
260:18 - go to my hatch layer and i'll create a
260:21 - hatch
260:22 - for it
260:23 - and i'll just
260:25 - choose let's say this wall enter so i've
260:28 - just created some random hatch i'll
260:30 - select it and now we can kind of go to
260:32 - town here so i know that this is uh
260:36 - this is 60 degrees this is 30 degrees if
260:40 - i remember correctly um
260:43 - so i believe if we do if we do zero
260:46 - degrees here oh sorry
260:49 - sorry where when the angle is 0 degrees
260:51 - it's at 45 right um so let me do or
260:56 - actually let me change the
260:58 - yeah i'll use this
261:00 - instead this hatch instead for the
261:02 - planks
261:04 - so instead of 45 we want to first start
261:07 - with horizontal so let me just say 45
261:11 - degrees that is not horizontal
261:14 - so let's add 90 more 135
261:18 - so now these are horizontal and now i
261:21 - can kind of rotate them
261:24 - so i need to rotate it back
261:28 - so
261:28 - 135 and i rotate it back by 30 degrees
261:32 - so that's going to be 0 105.
261:35 - one 105
261:36 - there we go
261:37 - and i really want the planks to start
261:40 - from this point right here so i will
261:42 - choose it as my as my origin set origin
261:47 - this point right here so the planks
261:49 - start from here
261:52 - okay and now for the scale of the planks
261:54 - i think the scale is kind of good but
261:57 - maybe i'll i'll do like 15
262:00 - something like that
262:03 - that's it uh now for the other wall same
262:06 - procedure hatch
262:08 - selected
262:11 - angle is not going to to be 105
262:14 - uh it's actually going to be
262:19 - [Music]
262:21 - that's pretty close
262:26 - my guess is that it's going to be 15
262:28 - right yeah it's going to be 15.
262:33 - you can always kind of rotate it with
262:35 - the slider here and see what kind of
262:38 - values work or you can do quick math in
262:40 - your head that that works as well so but
262:42 - but in this case the angle is 15. i used
262:46 - scale of 15 as well i believe
262:50 - and now i need see how these don't match
262:52 - i need the same origin point so i'll set
262:55 - origin right here and these don't match
262:59 - why don't they match
263:02 - oh right because the angle is different
263:04 - so of course
263:07 - sorry
263:08 - apologies of course they won't match but
263:10 - also
263:13 - that's 15 and that is also 15. they look
263:15 - very very different
263:17 - both being
263:19 - both being 15
263:20 - um
263:22 - a scale of 15. either way that's good
263:25 - enough
263:29 - doesn't matter
263:30 - okay so we have planks here right we we
263:33 - have our
263:34 - our building
263:36 - um
263:40 - kind of want to let me just do one thing
263:44 - offset
263:46 - uh 250
263:49 - go in
263:54 - when
263:57 - this is uh
263:58 - you you don't need to do this
264:02 - this is just me wanting to
264:07 - and i have
264:08 - something a little bit more
264:12 - complex in terms of the room
264:22 - until here
264:25 - bear with me
264:27 - it's not gonna take too long
264:29 - uh so that's gonna be that that that
264:31 - that's fine
264:33 - um can i
264:35 - go to medium turn off the hatch layer
264:39 - okay medium is my active turn off the
264:42 - hatch layer
264:43 - trim
264:45 - i'll clean this up a little bit
264:48 - just a little bit trim
264:51 - enter
264:53 - go away
264:56 - you are correct but you go away
265:00 - and don't need that anymore don't need
265:02 - that that
265:05 - or that
265:07 - this
265:09 - is fine
265:12 - like that
265:14 - did that
265:16 - trim again forgot one one part
265:21 - this
265:22 - um
265:25 - what
265:27 - select
265:29 - are you locked
265:30 - haven't accidentally locked it
265:37 - well that's awkward
265:39 - oh
265:43 - undo and do so that was a bug
265:48 - for that uh i will need to
265:51 - to fix it
265:54 - apparently uh that
265:56 - the screen was frozen for a little bit
265:58 - and i didn't see that there's there's a
266:02 - there was a bug
266:05 - so let's let's clean this up
266:09 - real fast so that you don't need to wait
266:12 - too long
266:20 - no need for that
266:24 - or that or that
266:27 - [Music]
266:28 - ah time when you want to do something
266:31 - nice you just need to deal with a crap
266:34 - ton of bugs okay so that's done
266:38 - this is fine
266:40 - no need for that this gets extended
266:45 - you and you get extended
266:48 - that all is fine and that just needs a
266:52 - line segment here
266:54 - okay
266:58 - a little bit more detail
267:01 - on on the roof just just to have
267:03 - something there okay let's let's uh
267:05 - let's move on uh so we have on our axle
267:08 - we have our
267:10 - plan we have our section
267:13 - if i want to
267:16 - maybe now it's the time to
267:19 - uh to create layouts
267:22 - for for plotting
267:25 - yeah i think it's it's time
267:27 - i think it's time
267:29 - so what we're going to do
267:33 - sorry
267:34 - what we're going to do is um
267:38 - i'm going to explain you what what
267:39 - layout is first of all i guess um so
267:42 - this is your model space this is a space
267:45 - in which you work it's not the space in
267:47 - which you prepare the
267:50 - the project to be printed out and where
267:52 - you work with
267:55 - additional information
267:58 - on the project
268:00 - well adding dimensions will be done here
268:02 - but everything else will be done
268:04 - separately in the
268:06 - layout so a layout is here in the bottom
268:09 - of this
268:15 - here in the bottom of the screen you can
268:16 - see layout uh layout one layout two and
268:20 - these are of just just there just doing
268:23 - their thing and we don't really need
268:25 - them we will be creating our own so i'll
268:27 - just
268:28 - delete
268:30 - okay you just right click on them and
268:32 - you just delete them
268:35 - delete
268:36 - okay
268:38 - oh this one doesn't delete you need at
268:40 - least one layout that's fine we will
268:42 - create our own and we will ignore this
268:44 - one
268:45 - so new layout you just click that plus
268:48 - sign you right click on it
268:51 - and you choose uh
268:54 - page setup manager
268:56 - well first let's rename it i guess
268:59 - first let's rename it
269:01 - and let's name it
269:04 - plan
269:06 - enter
269:08 - usually you the convention for naming
269:11 - them is
269:14 - zero zero
269:15 - dash plan
269:17 - and then zero one dash section zero two
269:19 - dash axo and so on so that all of them
269:22 - are kinda laid out properly
269:25 - but uh in this case we just have three
269:27 - drawings or whatever all right name name
269:29 - it whatever you want
269:31 - so that's our plan
269:33 - we go to page setup manager we right
269:35 - click on the layout name we go to page
269:37 - setup manager
269:39 - right here
269:40 - and we modify it
269:46 - here in the page setup manager you can
269:48 - see your layout one and the new one that
269:50 - you've created so you select it and you
269:52 - click modify
269:55 - okay so this is where
269:58 - you kind of set up everything about the
270:00 - layout uh and
270:03 - all all of the settings on how what kind
270:05 - of drawing you want to export right
270:08 - so
270:08 - let's start from the
270:10 - from the start
270:12 - uh microsoft print to pdf is fine
270:15 - i prefer using adobe pdf
270:18 - dwg to pdf is also fine
270:21 - but anything that can kind of generate
270:23 - pdf you choose you don't choose a
270:27 - printer because you will be exporting it
270:30 - as pdf right so
270:32 - printing
270:34 - is not just printing on a sheet of paper
270:37 - or plotting plotting is the same thing
270:39 - as printing by the way
270:41 - it's not printing on a sheet necessarily
270:43 - on a sheet of paper it can be printing
270:45 - to a file right so so to a pdf
270:50 - so in this case i'm going to choose
270:53 - yeah let's just go with microsoft print
270:55 - to pdf
270:56 - if if you
270:58 - want you can use adobe pdf you can use
271:00 - dwg to pdf whichever is to pdf you use
271:05 - uh so that's done let me just hit
271:07 - properties here and just double check
271:12 - yeah that's fine that's whatever i'll
271:15 - keep it with the properties
271:17 - paper size
271:19 - here we will find a3
271:22 - that's the size of the paper that we're
271:24 - going to be using
271:25 - uh what to plot layout yes
271:29 - uh plot offset uh keep it at zero zero
271:33 - that's fine
271:34 - scale one two one yes
271:37 - so here the scale is off the page not of
271:41 - your model so the scale needs to be one
271:44 - to one
271:45 - landscape
271:46 - yes
271:49 - and plot
271:50 - style i use none
271:56 - for plot style i use none
272:01 - that's important
272:02 - that's it
272:04 - no need for anything
272:06 - else
272:14 - yeah no need for anything else
272:16 - let's just hit ok
272:18 - hit close and now you can see that the
272:21 - page became bigger right and this is uh
272:26 - basically this is like a window uh
272:29 - showing us our mall and we will position
272:32 - our our geometry in this
272:35 - in this page so
272:38 - how do you do that
272:41 - well
272:42 - the thing is first of all you need to
272:44 - understand the philosophy of layout so a
272:46 - layout is a
272:48 - digital a in this case a3 sheet of paper
272:52 - which has a window in it right it has
272:55 - like a hole in it and through that hole
272:59 - you see
273:00 - you see stuff that you drew in your
273:03 - model space
273:05 - right so you see this stuff
273:08 - in your layout
273:10 - important note right
273:12 - uh
273:13 - that this
273:15 - rectangle right here
273:18 - is the frame of that particular hole or
273:21 - that particular
273:22 - window
273:24 - right
273:24 - so you need that rectangle to be
273:28 - um first of all properly sized
273:32 - you know to fill the the
273:35 - the page and second of all you kind of
273:37 - want to understand what's the
273:40 - [Music]
273:42 - um what's the scale of of
273:45 - of of these elements because right now
273:47 - they're just kind of randomly zoomed in
273:48 - there's no scale right so you want to
273:52 - have
273:52 - the scale one more thing that i'm gonna
273:55 - do
273:56 - is i am going to
273:58 - before i kind of continue with the
274:00 - layouts i'll go to the model space and i
274:02 - will create some room here and of course
274:05 - my hatches will not let me so i'll
274:07 - kind of delete the hatches for a bit
274:11 - f8
274:12 - i'll just create a little bit of space
274:15 - between these
274:16 - just so that when i grab the view of the
274:19 - plan it doesn't kind of grab a little
274:21 - bit of the section i'll create the
274:23 - sections in the sections the hatch in
274:26 - just a second for now let's just keep it
274:28 - and you can see that it by the way
274:29 - updates here okay
274:31 - so first thing
274:33 - is
274:34 - understanding that this is a page and
274:36 - this is a window into your model space
274:38 - and you had a look look at your model
274:41 - through that window
274:43 - um
274:44 - second this is this frame this frame uh
274:47 - i kind of want it to be
274:49 - let's go to layer properties i want it
274:52 - to be in a separate as a separate
274:55 - entity so i'll create a new layer
274:59 - i'll call it i'll call this layer
275:02 - no
275:03 - print
275:05 - do not print layer
275:07 - um and i'll keep it
275:09 - oh by the way here you can see it says
275:11 - white
275:12 - even though it shows black that that is
275:16 - not a bug that is how it works right so
275:18 - it will show up white in the model space
275:21 - but it will be black as it's printed out
275:25 - just something that just your autocad
275:27 - things
275:29 - okay
275:32 - so
275:33 - this frame right here i will select it
275:36 - and i will move it to the no print layer
275:41 - and the reason why i'm doing this is
275:43 - because when we are going to be printing
275:45 - out the layout i don't want this frame
275:48 - to be visible
275:50 - by the way those of you are thinking
275:52 - will the grid be visible no no the grid
275:54 - will not be visible in the final print
275:59 - um
276:00 - but i also don't want the frame to be
276:01 - visible so that's why i'm putting it in
276:03 - the separate layer and then we will just
276:05 - make sure that that layer is not being
276:07 - printed
276:09 - during the
276:11 - printing process
276:13 - then the next thing is
276:16 - well let's position this to the center
276:18 - so i can just kind of move it around
276:21 - right
276:22 - f8
276:23 - i can just move it anywhere i want
276:26 - i did this window
276:28 - and now let's make sure
276:30 - that the scale
276:32 - or or not the scale that we are focused
276:35 - on the plan view right in this
276:38 - particular
276:40 - uh
276:42 - in this particular layout so i'm going
276:44 - to double click inside of it
276:47 - double click
276:48 - and now we are not
276:50 - we can't
276:51 - move around here
276:53 - in the layout but rather we are moving
276:56 - around in the window so when you double
276:58 - click inside you are
277:01 - done working
277:02 - within the window and you can zoom in
277:04 - zoom out so you can control the
277:06 - the positioning here right so what i'm
277:09 - going to do is i will select my plan
277:12 - and i will type in z
277:14 - or zoom
277:16 - and then i will
277:17 - here in the bottom
277:20 - i'll choose object
277:23 - so i've just zoomed in to this object
277:26 - right
277:27 - once i've done that
277:29 - i just double click
277:31 - anywhere else right not inside
277:35 - and now
277:36 - my layout is focused on this particular
277:41 - or this window this layout window is
277:43 - focused on this particular drawing
277:45 - right that's important
277:48 - i will now need to make sure that the
277:52 - scale of this drawing in an a3 page is a
277:55 - correct scale it's 1 to
277:57 - 100 1 to 50 whatever scale i want it to
278:01 - be right so how do you change the scale
278:03 - well
278:04 - for that you will need to access the
278:07 - properties
278:08 - of this window frame
278:10 - so i select this window frame
278:13 - and i type in pr short for properties
278:16 - and hit enter
278:19 - it will open up this page for me
278:22 - or not page this menu box for me and
278:25 - i'll position it here
278:28 - and here in the properties
278:31 - i can see that there's
278:33 - under misc
278:35 - right here there's standard scale and
278:37 - custom scale so i'll not be using a
278:40 - custom scale rather i will just expand
278:43 - the standard skill and i'll find the
278:45 - scale that i want in this case probably
278:48 - want to
278:49 - [Music]
278:52 - honestly one to 50 is enough
278:55 - for this kind of a project
278:57 - like
278:58 - even one to a hundred would be enough
279:00 - but that's way too small uh so instead
279:02 - i'll just use one to fifty right for for
279:05 - my scale you could use 1 to 25
279:09 - that's fine as well but i'll use 1 to
279:11 - 50.
279:14 - like that
279:16 - and now my
279:17 - this particular drawing this drawing
279:20 - right here is at 1 to 50 scale
279:24 - right
279:26 - i will close my properties tab
279:30 - escape to unselect and from now on i
279:33 - will not be messing messing around with
279:36 - this particular layout i can still move
279:38 - it around and whatnot
279:41 - right but i will not be
279:45 - messing around with it
279:47 - now
279:49 - here
279:50 - if if i were to
279:52 - [Music]
279:56 - if i were to check
279:58 - ada05
280:00 - requirements
280:06 - stamp
280:07 - each page will have ada05 stamp
280:11 - including the name of the student the
280:12 - date the name of the drawing and the
280:14 - scale of the drawing on bottom right
280:16 - side of the page
280:18 - okay
280:19 - bottom right side of the page we need a
280:21 - stamp so what i'm going to do is i will
280:24 - create a
280:27 - do we create one more layer
280:30 - yeah let's create one more layer
280:33 - and i'll call it
280:35 - layout
280:36 - text
280:39 - layout text
280:41 - and i'll make it just white color by the
280:44 - way there are two white colors uh this
280:46 - one right here which is two five five
280:49 - it's gonna say two five five here and
280:51 - there's this one here that's gonna say
280:54 - white
280:55 - this one the two five five one is going
280:57 - to be printed out
280:59 - white
281:00 - this one
281:02 - the one that says white will be printed
281:05 - out black
281:07 - okay
281:09 - rewind if you need it if you need to and
281:12 - then listen to this again
281:14 - i'll just hit okay
281:16 - so we're using the white that's going to
281:17 - be printed out as black
281:20 - escape
281:21 - and i'll just choose this layout text as
281:24 - my current layer uh current current
281:27 - layer in which i draw and i'll i'll kind
281:30 - of start going to town
281:32 - on this so the first thing that i want
281:35 - is a bracket
281:36 - like a a framing of the page so i'm just
281:40 - going to first draw out an a3 page
281:44 - um
281:45 - [Music]
281:47 - well that's not zero zero zero
281:49 - coordinates that's weird why well
281:52 - whatever doesn't matter i'll just draw
281:54 - out an a3 page
281:56 - um and it's drawn at one to one scale by
281:58 - the way so it's 420 millimeters by 297
282:02 - millimeters by 420
282:05 - by 297
282:06 - right like that i'll just move it kind
282:10 - of close
282:11 - close to the bottom left corner like so
282:15 - so that it
282:17 - it fits with the
282:18 - page that we have here doesn't need to
282:20 - be perfect that's fine and now i will
282:23 - offset
282:25 - uh this this line here by
282:28 - uh
282:29 - 10 millimeters yes that's gonna be one
282:31 - centimeter that's enough
282:33 - by one centimeter so now i have the
282:36 - inner bracket and i don't need the old
282:37 - one uh of
282:40 - like th this gap is always one
282:42 - centimeter from the side of the page and
282:44 - i can use it uh for placing of my
282:47 - of my stamp
282:49 - so the stamp is basically just a bunch
282:51 - of information about the the project
282:53 - about the drawing and i'm going to be
282:56 - quite quick about this because there's
282:58 - nothing smart right so i'm still in the
283:00 - layout text and i'm going to write write
283:03 - some text actually right so i'm going to
283:05 - start writing here
283:08 - maybe that's a little bit too fast
283:10 - t enter short for text specify first
283:13 - corner specify second corner
283:15 - uh probably change the height of it from
283:18 - 200 millimeters to something a little
283:21 - bit less
283:22 - um
283:24 - so things that are uh less than three
283:26 - millimeters depending on the font are
283:29 - becoming harder and harder to read so
283:32 - i'm gonna say three millimeters
283:34 - why is this not updating
283:37 - dd
283:42 - you are user are not updating at all
283:48 - that's that is strange
283:49 - okay
283:51 - let me try again
283:53 - select this text
283:54 - and i double click you now i can't
283:57 - yes i
283:59 - uh can we change you
284:03 - three millimeters
284:08 - the effect of using the style you know
284:10 - just
284:14 - okay this is being um no
284:18 - this is being a little bit awkward
284:21 - m text
284:28 - this is a little bit too big isn't it
284:31 - but for some reason it oh it
284:37 - well there's some
284:38 - [Music]
284:39 - some issues here and there with the
284:43 - without account i guess so now it works
284:48 - let me just uh just to make sure that
284:51 - this will work as well
284:54 - let me try
284:57 - now it says 200
285:00 - i change this to three
285:02 - draws as three
285:09 - either way um either way
285:12 - let's do this again and now let's do
285:14 - this
285:16 - cleanly i guess text
285:19 - text specify start point of text let's
285:22 - see from here specify height
285:25 - so i will specify
285:27 - um
285:28 - [Music]
285:29 - five millimeters in height
285:32 - specify rotation angle zero
285:35 - okay it just works
285:38 - sure uh
285:41 - my name is
285:44 - okay
285:46 - uh next text
285:48 - t enter
285:49 - first corner
285:52 - and i will here i'll just say
285:56 - [Music]
286:02 - and here it's
286:04 - doing another thing
286:07 - whatever name
286:09 - that's that's going to be where my name
286:11 - is going to be
286:13 - now let's do
286:18 - the date the name of the drawing and the
286:20 - scale of the drawing okay so i i still
286:23 - need some things and honestly once i
286:25 - have one text object i just kind of like
286:28 - to make copies of it and just
286:31 - like double click on it and write what i
286:33 - need to write so
286:35 - ad05 we will have
286:38 - the date
286:40 - and i know this is not the
286:42 - 20210202
286:46 - i know that this is not the cleanest way
286:49 - of how to do it but
286:52 - whatever works for you there's there's
286:54 - no rule in how you need to draw it
286:58 - um
287:00 - and then there's to be
287:03 - title and yeah whatever
287:08 - title
287:11 - [Music]
287:13 - and date
287:14 - okay so now let let's uh make some
287:19 - some adjustments right uh we need to put
287:22 - all of this information into into this
287:24 - corner right here in a kind of
287:27 - nice nice way so i'm going to draw with
287:30 - a polyline i'm just going to draw out a
287:34 - table that is let's say going to be 200
287:37 - mil
287:38 - long and that's not horizontal f8
287:41 - 200 millimeters by
287:45 - um let's say
287:47 - by by
287:50 - 40
287:51 - millimeters
287:53 - by 200
287:55 - close it off if we need to we'll we'll
287:57 - trim away some some stuff from it
287:59 - um and then i'm actually i'm going to
288:02 - just select this and explode it
288:05 - so that i can work with each individual
288:08 - edge
288:09 - separately or each individual line
288:11 - separately and i will say that aada05
288:15 - is going to be located right here
288:19 - somewhere here
288:23 - and it actually is going to be scaled
288:25 - it's going to be twice the size to all
288:28 - other
288:29 - um
288:30 - all other information so i'm just
288:32 - scaling it to
288:33 - by two
288:36 - position it
288:38 - there we go make a copy of it or make a
288:42 - copy of this
288:47 - uh probably some something like so
288:52 - move this my name is gonna go here
288:57 - um
288:59 - you can just kind of position it like so
289:07 - like that
289:10 - and now i'm just going to kind of build
289:12 - a table uh build a table around it
289:21 - that
289:27 - that that looks okay
289:29 - i will center this as well
289:39 - okay
289:40 - uh now for the date and the title uh the
289:43 - title will go in here so i'm just going
289:45 - to move the title here and i'm going to
289:47 - kind of double click on it and change
289:49 - this
289:51 - it's ground floor plan so it's going to
289:53 - be ground
289:57 - floor
289:58 - plan
290:01 - m
290:03 - or scale
290:05 - 1 2
290:08 - 15.
290:10 - now we can say at 1 250.
290:14 - usually add is at what height are you
290:16 - cutting but here we don't really care so
290:20 - we'll just say 1 to 50.
290:22 - so that's ground floor plan and then we
290:24 - have the date
290:29 - 2021
290:32 - and position it properly that's it uh
290:34 - that that's all you need to do uh right
290:37 - so you have your um
290:39 - [Music]
290:41 - your stamp here right um
290:46 - the stamp is it does have much more
290:48 - information in it but this is just like
290:50 - first practice
290:53 - okay so that is done we have our plan we
290:55 - have our layout everything is correct
290:57 - let's do two more layouts right so the
291:00 - way we will do other two layouts is now
291:03 - by right clicking and choosing to
291:09 - move or copy
291:11 - so we right click our existing layout
291:13 - zero zero plan move our copy
291:16 - and we choose
291:19 - move to end
291:21 - create copy right so there's going to be
291:24 - a copy created at the end of the layout
291:27 - line i hit ok
291:29 - so we have this one
291:31 - we will right click it and choose to
291:35 - we will choose to rename it
291:38 - to
291:39 - 0 1 dash
291:41 - section
291:43 - right zero one dash section
291:45 - uh that is done and then i'm gonna while
291:49 - i'm at it i'm just going to right click
291:55 - move an or copy
291:56 - move to end create copy okay
292:01 - uh rename rename rename to
292:04 - zero two
292:07 - axle
292:09 - right so we have section xo and plan and
292:12 - now layout one is just
292:15 - randomly there so i'm just going to
292:17 - delete it
292:19 - no need for that
292:21 - there we go the only layouts that we
292:23 - need are these three
292:25 - okay so we have that uh now for the
292:27 - section i will double click inside of
292:29 - this this window uh find the section
292:32 - zoom into it
292:34 - zs enter
292:37 - or
292:38 - that's
292:39 - that is not
292:40 - uh an autocad command that is rhino
292:43 - command z enter
292:46 - o
292:47 - enter there we go that is
292:50 - autocad command double click out
292:53 - select the frame
292:55 - uh pr for properties
292:59 - annotation scale no not annotation
293:00 - custom scale uh
293:02 - that standard scale 1 250
293:06 - like that
293:08 - close it off that's done
293:12 - and i will just change this as well
293:16 - so
293:17 - this is section
293:20 - a dash a at 1 250
293:26 - that's all we need to change here and
293:28 - that is done and now axo
293:30 - double click inside find the axle
293:34 - zoom selected
293:37 - z enter oh enter not zoom selected
293:41 - and this guy right here we don't really
293:43 - have a scale for it so this is just
293:45 - going to be axon
293:50 - axon metric
293:53 - diagram
293:58 - something like that
293:59 - and actually if you want to by the way
294:01 - if you want to
294:02 - resize your
294:04 - uh your window you can you can just
294:06 - click on these uh
294:09 - do that these you you select the frame
294:12 - you click on this
294:14 - corner point here and you can just
294:16 - resize it any way you want right
294:18 - that that that works as well uh axo
294:21 - doesn't have a scale so i will not be
294:24 - messing around with it too much
294:26 - i'll just keep it as it is okay so we
294:28 - have that done we have axonometric
294:31 - diagram we have section
294:33 - we have plan
294:36 - okay i think we're good so now in the
294:39 - model space
294:41 - um
294:42 - we actually need to
294:44 - or rather not in the model space let's
294:46 - go back to layout space
294:49 - let's change the colors
294:52 - i i think that's that's important to to
294:54 - to kind of change the colors
294:56 - before we do that of course we need to
294:58 - add the hatches i forgot that i have
295:01 - deleted the hatch
295:02 - so let me re-add it real fast
295:05 - u u u u
295:09 - u and u enter select the hatch
295:13 - uh
295:14 - angled angle is going to be 0 and scale
295:18 - is 20 that's perfect that's it okay
295:20 - let's go back to the plan so that's how
295:22 - it looks like right now
295:24 - and to change the colors you change the
295:27 - layer properties right you change the
295:30 - the properties of the layers
295:32 - um
295:34 - for the colors
295:36 - so
295:38 - hatch
295:39 - let's start with the hatch right it's
295:40 - going to be the easiest one or rather
295:42 - let's let's leave the hatch for the last
295:43 - one
295:44 - um rather let's start with the thick
295:46 - line the red line right so here
295:49 - um
295:50 - well when i am in the model space and i
295:53 - look at layer properties i can only see
295:55 - one color right it's it's just
295:58 - magenta red yellow blah blah blah one
296:00 - line time one line weight
296:02 - if i go to my plan
296:06 - right here
296:07 - to my layout and i go to layer
296:09 - properties i can see two colors
296:12 - that is important
296:13 - because this is the color of the model
296:15 - space this is the color
296:17 - in which it's going to be plotted out or
296:20 - exported
296:22 - very big difference
296:24 - so i am going to in the
296:27 - um
296:29 - is it called white space no it's it's
296:32 - something else um
296:35 - in this column
296:38 - sorry sorry about that um in this column
296:41 - i'm going to change start changing the
296:43 - colors first right so the thick
296:46 - thick
296:47 - line
296:48 - uh i'll change from the red color to
296:51 - black
296:52 - right here or
296:55 - to white actually
296:58 - i know it's it's it's confusing but
297:00 - you'll get used to it so i'll change it
297:02 - to this white color not this white color
297:05 - this is this white is going to be
297:06 - printed out as white this white is going
297:08 - to be printed out as black right so it
297:10 - needs to say white here i'll change it
297:12 - to white
297:15 - and now if
297:16 - i
297:18 - doesn't
297:19 - go
297:20 - [Music]
297:26 - wait a minute
297:27 - yep that was that was my bad sorry i
297:30 - figured it out so apparently in the
297:33 - paper space right here
297:35 - um
297:36 - this is what's called the paper space
297:38 - you can't really override um the the
297:42 - color this way
297:43 - so i'll turn this back to red
297:46 - sorry about that that's a little bit of
297:48 - a hiccup
297:49 - uh instead
297:51 - instead i need to go into the
297:55 - model space so i need to double click
297:58 - to go into this view
298:00 - and here i can go to then i can go to
298:03 - layer properties just make sure that you
298:04 - don't accidentally scroll your mouse
298:06 - wheel or anything like that you don't
298:08 - mess up the scale
298:10 - i mean if you mess up the skill you can
298:11 - always kind of repeat the steps and get
298:14 - the scale back
298:15 - either way
298:17 - once i am inside of this view
298:22 - that this is super important once i'm
298:24 - inside of this view then i can override
298:26 - the color how it's going to be printed
298:28 - out so thick line is going to be
298:32 - white
298:33 - see it turns
298:35 - uh it turns to black
298:37 - text is going to be
298:39 - let's see text is going to be blue in my
298:42 - case or maybe red yeah let's go for red
298:46 - oh i'll say text is red
298:48 - sure
298:50 - no print is whatever a medium line is
298:53 - going to be also black so white
298:57 - i need
298:58 - i need naming conventions for this uh
299:02 - thin line
299:04 - white
299:05 - and hatch
299:07 - for hatch i will say
299:09 - [Music]
299:11 - dark red something like color
299:14 - color 14
299:16 - something like that
299:18 - right
299:20 - so i have this
299:22 - once i've done that i will just escape
299:24 - out double click outside of the model
299:27 - space and now i can see the the colors
299:30 - have changed and
299:32 - i will just need to do this for every
299:35 - every layout here
299:37 - um
299:38 - a trick on how to do it for all of them
299:41 - would be just to go into model space
299:43 - and change every
299:45 - like in the layer properties come on in
299:48 - the layer properties change the colors
299:50 - here and then it will update for all of
299:53 - the
299:54 - layouts but sometimes in different
299:55 - layouts you want different colors um
299:59 - so so this is
300:00 - a little bit better to do so double
300:03 - click inside layer properties and i will
300:05 - just really quickly go through this so
300:08 - that was 14
300:11 - that is gonna be white
300:15 - it's gonna be white
300:17 - i wonder if there's like a fast way of
300:19 - how to do this
300:21 - like setting everything to white
300:25 - oh the text needs to be red sorry
300:29 - like that
300:31 - double click
300:33 - and for axo
300:35 - uh for instance in the axo i don't want
300:38 - the hatch to be
300:40 - uh to to be
300:42 - dark red color i just want it to be like
300:45 - gray
300:46 - so here i can change i can change up the
300:49 - overrides
300:50 - just make sure that you have double
300:52 - clicked
300:53 - layer properties
300:55 - hatch i will just say
300:57 - darkish gray
300:59 - like that
301:01 - medium line
301:03 - i'll just go for
301:05 - black
301:07 - decline
301:09 - black
301:11 - thin line
301:13 - uh
301:14 - black text
301:17 - red
301:19 - okay something like that
301:21 - and now you can see
301:24 - here the hatch is shown in in a
301:26 - different way right from from all other
301:29 - layouts
301:30 - so that is my
301:32 - that's my initial setup and that is uh
301:35 - basically what what what i'm dealing
301:37 - with right now
301:39 - um
301:41 - right so we can go to model space and
301:43 - let's see what other things do we need
301:46 - to add here right what kind of other
301:49 - things do do we want to add
301:51 - for this particular project so
301:55 - let's see how we can import stuff right
301:57 - let's see how we can import
302:00 - objects into our scene such as a person
302:04 - a tree maybe maybe a tree for the axo
302:09 - i don't know
302:11 - maybe nothing for the plan
302:14 - um so importing
302:16 - if we go to
302:19 - pimp my
302:21 - drawing dot com
302:23 - at the link is right here
302:28 - to the linework library
302:30 - this link right here
302:31 - if we go here
302:33 - we can find the person
302:35 - which which we can use so i will just
302:37 - kind of use a random
302:40 - why are there
302:43 - and that's fine that's a good one
302:50 - everyone's kind of posing i don't want
302:52 - them to be posing
302:56 - i'll just get this guy
302:58 - so
302:59 - here we have this person and i can click
303:02 - on download dwg
303:04 - and it just kind of downloads it right
303:07 - and downloads the dwg file so i'll show
303:10 - in folder
303:11 - um
303:13 - that's uh that's the dwg file and all i
303:16 - need to do is just click and drag
303:20 - dragon into autocad
303:23 - release
303:25 - and click
303:27 - and then just hit enter enter
303:29 - enter right for for all of the questions
303:33 - basically now i have it in autocad right
303:36 - that is super simple
303:38 - super simple to do
303:40 - and it is what's called the block
303:44 - right so um you can see that all of this
303:47 - selects at the same time and i perhaps i
303:51 - don't want it because this is a little
303:53 - bit too much detail for my type of
303:55 - project so i will
303:58 - um and on sorry one more thing before we
304:00 - kind of look into what a block is it
304:03 - also imports
304:05 - with more
304:09 - layers
304:12 - or i guess it doesn't
304:16 - oh it does it just lagged
304:19 - if if the layers lag just switch between
304:22 - all and all used right and it's going to
304:25 - update
304:28 - autocad come on
304:30 - um so it does import with these two
304:32 - layers in our outer which we can just
304:35 - change like any other layer right in in
304:38 - the layout
304:39 - um so that's that's good so for this
304:42 - person right here i will
304:44 - uh
304:45 - look at the uh
304:48 - for this
304:49 - import right here i will type in
304:52 - properties
304:54 - and i can see that it's imported into
304:56 - the hash layer but that's whatever but
304:59 - it's basically well it doesn't say here
305:01 - oh yeah it does block reference right so
305:03 - this is a block i don't want it as a
305:06 - block so how do you get rid of it i want
305:08 - to use the lines separately how do you
305:10 - get rid of it
305:13 - from from being a block you just
305:14 - exploded
305:18 - so you selected you exploded and now you
305:20 - have all of the lines separated right so
305:23 - i only want the outline of this dude so
305:26 - i'll take the outline
305:28 - and i'll just move it
305:30 - from let's see the bottom of the the
305:33 - shoe
305:34 - to somewhere
305:36 - [Music]
305:38 - i don't know
305:40 - maybe near the window
305:45 - maybe somewhere here
305:47 - maybe here
305:49 - yeah somewhere here
305:50 - so i'll just please place him here right
305:53 - and then i can just use him to trim
305:57 - trim away the necessary bits
306:02 - you know which
306:03 - he's standing in front of
306:08 - that
306:10 - like that okay that's it i have my
306:13 - silhouette of a person and i don't need
306:17 - all of the other lines so i'll just
306:18 - delete them right so honestly then i can
306:22 - see that it's only the outer layer that
306:25 - i'm i'm still using the inner layer
306:28 - which had all of the lines inside of the
306:29 - person i am not using that anymore so
306:32 - i'll just delete it
306:33 - delete the layer altogether
306:35 - selected layer was not deleted
306:38 - i will not be deleting it i will keep it
306:41 - forever
306:43 - just don't worry about it
306:45 - anyway for the outer layer
306:47 - i don't care the color in which it's
306:49 - shown here but i do care the color in
306:51 - which it's shown in the layout
306:53 - especially in the section layout right
306:56 - here
306:57 - because right now it's purple
307:00 - right
307:00 - so i'll go i'll double click inside of
307:03 - that layout click layer properties and
307:06 - change the color to
307:09 - [Music]
307:11 - index color choose index color here and
307:14 - then to white
307:17 - close that's it double click out we're
307:20 - good to go
307:21 - so that's that's the
307:24 - the person
307:26 - let me do this again
307:28 - with the trees
307:29 - so i will just go to pimpmydrawing.com
307:33 - uh here in the bottom i'll choose trees
307:36 - i'll find a nice little let's see this
307:39 - guy right here
307:41 - download it as dwg that's a small maple
307:44 - tree that's perfect in autocad i'll make
307:46 - sure that i'm in my model space
307:49 - where is my maple tree five
307:51 - it's still being downloaded
307:54 - why is this so slow
307:56 - 123 kilobytes
308:02 - pause
308:04 - okay it's it's downloaded actually um so
308:08 - i'll just drag it in
308:10 - bam
308:12 - i'll just place it like so enter enter
308:14 - enter so i have my small little maple
308:17 - tree maybe i'll scale it up
308:20 - um
308:21 - from this point 1.25
308:24 - just 125 so that is a little bit larger
308:27 - than the
308:29 - then the building
308:30 - and i will move it down
308:33 - so i think that's that that that looks
308:36 - fine
308:37 - um
308:38 - perhaps i want it on the other side as
308:40 - well so i'll just make a copy of it i'll
308:44 - keep it as a blog by the way in in this
308:46 - case because i don't really
308:48 - well
308:49 - in in case where the maple tree kind of
308:52 - goes behind the building i would need to
308:55 - explode it and trim it away
308:58 - but in other cases i don't maybe i will
309:02 - just to show you
309:04 - explode
309:07 - i explode the block
309:10 - trim enter enter and i just trim away
309:13 - the oh
309:15 - that's gonna be super laggy my mouse is
309:19 - frozen
309:28 - okay um so
309:30 - trimming huh let me turn off the hatch
309:33 - maybe that's gonna help
309:35 - uh make zero my active layer turn off
309:38 - the hatch
309:39 - i tried trimming again
309:42 - why is it
309:43 - why is it lagging
309:45 - i wonder
309:47 - shouldn't lag
309:49 - maybe that's because there's too much
309:53 - too many lines
309:59 - if it lags for you as well this this
310:01 - hard just don't trim the trees
310:04 - right just don't don't have them trimmed
310:08 - um
310:09 - i'll go make some coffee while while
310:11 - this is
310:12 - crashing and then we will continue
310:17 - yep so it completely crashed
310:20 - which actually
310:22 - i will use as
310:24 - an opportunity to show you how to
310:26 - uh if you have a crash uh what can you
310:29 - do about it right so
310:32 - when you load autocad again it's going
310:35 - to say that in your previous work
310:37 - session
310:39 - the program terminated unexpectedly blah
310:41 - blah
310:43 - and you can get a backup from your
310:45 - drawing recovery manager
310:47 - cool let's see how much it saved so i'll
310:50 - just hit close
310:52 - right here and i'll here on the left
310:55 - hand side of the screen i can see my
310:57 - backup file and i can see my
311:01 - [Music]
311:04 - uh that is not good
311:07 - that is not good at all
311:10 - let's see this one
311:13 - let's see this guy right here so as as
311:15 - you're clicking through it you can see
311:17 - like these three versions and
311:20 - aad05 that the weird one
311:23 - uh kind of looks like there is a guy
311:26 - there
311:28 - so at least that
311:30 - has been saved so i'm just going to
311:32 - double click on that
311:33 - and open it up
311:36 - and that seems to be okay um at least it
311:40 - does have
311:41 - the
311:43 - the stuff
311:44 - like that most of the stuff that i have
311:46 - done so
311:47 - we're not missing too much and let me
311:50 - change the camera exposure uh we're not
311:53 - missing too much so uh i will just
311:55 - really quickly
311:56 - um
311:58 - re recreate what i have been doing and
312:00 - this time around i will not be trimming
312:02 - the trees that's for sure so
312:05 - explode that
312:09 - so that get the outline move it
312:12 - m
312:16 - from here to
312:17 - wherever it was
312:19 - over here
312:21 - fine
312:24 - enter enter
312:28 - wonder what's up with the trees and then
312:30 - then crashing it never used to crash
312:32 - before maybe the new version really
312:34 - doesn't like the amount of points that
312:37 - the three pole lines have
312:39 - uh that's probably the the culprit
312:41 - behind it
312:42 - uh so just keep an eye out for that
312:45 - either way this is fine and now we just
312:47 - go to section and we change the
312:50 - the color of the outer line here
312:54 - to
312:55 - white
312:58 - there we go
313:00 - um like that
313:02 - oops
313:04 - go back to model and just to be sure i
313:07 - will save
313:09 - keep saving
313:10 - so i'll just save it
313:12 - as aad05
313:16 - new
313:18 - hit save
313:19 - there we go okay so oh yeah and we don't
313:22 - need those
313:24 - so the trees
313:26 - three trees trees again drag dragging
313:29 - them in placing them
313:32 - uh one
313:33 - enter enter enter
313:35 - scale
313:37 - from here 1.25
313:40 - just a little bit bigger just move it
313:42 - slightly down so that it's kind of
313:45 - positioned correctly copy it to the
313:47 - other side
313:49 - my god
313:50 - why that's fine um it is what it is so
313:54 - we have our trees here and i'll actually
313:57 - copy
314:00 - um
314:01 - f8
314:02 - just have a proper copy here i'll say
314:05 - that one tree is located here while the
314:07 - other one is kind of located somewhere
314:09 - here
314:10 - maybe this one is
314:12 - actually here and it's actually
314:15 - a little bit bigger than the other one
314:18 - 1.25 again
314:26 - like that so let's look at it in this
314:28 - section so in the section i can see that
314:30 - the trees are being blocked off by the
314:33 - frame a little bit so i'm going to
314:35 - move the frame
314:37 - like that
314:40 - and like that
314:43 - just so that they are being shown
314:46 - and also i will change the inner
314:49 - uh
314:50 - inner areas of the trees to have a
314:52 - different color so i'll go to oops
314:55 - i first need to double click
314:57 - inside i'll go to layer properties and
314:59 - here i will just change the inner
315:03 - layer
315:04 - color to
315:06 - the
315:07 - medium gray
315:09 - hit okay
315:10 - close
315:11 - that's good
315:12 - same thing for axo
315:14 - oh for axle we actually need
315:19 - maybe we'll need to have a smaller axle
315:21 - that's fine i will just double click and
315:24 - scale out
315:32 - super vertical though
315:35 - click here
315:37 - and we make this bigger let me just snap
315:39 - it to the
315:41 - to the sides here like that
315:44 - uh that is almost good enough but i kind
315:47 - of want to move this tree up because i
315:50 - am dealing with the horizontal
315:52 - orientation of this so i will go or
315:55 - rather we can kind of
315:58 - select all of this
316:00 - z enter o enter
316:02 - zoom objects
316:06 - we can't
316:08 - maybe we can do it other way around if i
316:11 - just go to properties
316:14 - pr and here
316:16 - uh properties of the
316:19 - what the hell
316:22 - that's the polyline oh that's the frame
316:24 - that's the frame um
316:27 - i don't want to select the frame though
316:29 - so how do we do this we can select both
316:32 - of them
316:33 - and then from both of them i will just
316:35 - choose viewport
316:38 - and here i will just change the the
316:41 - scale
316:42 - um let's use custom and if i make this
316:46 - uh
316:47 - this number
316:49 - larger
316:50 - the scale should increase so
316:53 - looks like that
316:56 - let's do
317:03 - 0.0017 or something like that oops
317:06 - 0.017
317:09 - there we go that's that's fine we can
317:11 - now
317:12 - um
317:14 - clip around here
317:17 - like so
317:18 - well that that was the incorrect line
317:21 - that is fine
317:25 - kinda still
317:27 - still work with this
317:32 - move this in
317:33 - like so
317:36 - grab the
317:40 - line segment here snap it no we can't
317:43 - snap it
317:44 - and grab that one then and snap it now
317:47 - it's fine okay so it was just a little
317:49 - bit of cleaning up there's there's
317:51 - nothing nothing special about what i've
317:53 - what i've done uh there is a little bit
317:55 - of a tree that's uh kind of sticking
317:57 - into the
317:59 - the stamp but that's fine that's uh
318:02 - that's okay if it if it's doing that
318:05 - um layer properties let me change the
318:07 - colors not for the hatch
318:10 - wait why is oh right right right right
318:13 - right i need to double click inside and
318:15 - then change the layer properties to
318:18 - inner line being medium gray
318:21 - and the outer line being
318:26 - black or
318:28 - it says white but it's black
318:31 - okay cool we're done
318:33 - good so that's how you import stuff and
318:36 - apparently you can't trim
318:38 - but that's that's good to know oh i
318:41 - messed it up
318:42 - so i accidentally zoomed out and now
318:45 - it's all messy so i will need to
318:49 - kind of select all of this
318:51 - zoom enter oh enter again
318:54 - double click out select the frame
318:57 - pr for properties and just make sure
318:59 - that the standard scale is set to 1 to
319:02 - 50.
319:04 - there we go
319:06 - so every time when you accidentally zoom
319:08 - out you need to do this
319:10 - exo is fine section is fine plan is fine
319:13 - okay model space
319:16 - um we have imported stuff we have
319:20 - that
319:21 - let's add grid lines
319:24 - let's add dashed lines
319:26 - and let's add
319:28 - measurements
319:30 - right so the first thing that i'm going
319:31 - to do is i will add grid lines to
319:34 - both the plan and
319:37 - the section and the way you do it is
319:40 - well first i'll just work with the
319:41 - helper line
319:43 - and i'll just draw them out
319:45 - so the grid lines are usually
319:47 - anchored to the inner
319:49 - inner walls
319:51 - inner side of the walls that's going to
319:53 - be one grid line that is going to be
319:56 - another one
319:57 - that is going to be the third one
319:59 - [Music]
320:00 - right here
320:01 - uh probably
320:03 - here is going to be the fourth one
320:06 - fifth one
320:08 - this one these are used for construction
320:10 - purposes and they're quite uh quite
320:12 - quite useful for that uh honestly
320:16 - i'm thinking of adding a grid line here
320:19 - as well
320:22 - i really want to add the grid line for
320:26 - this but maybe that's not necessary
320:36 - um
320:43 - sorry i'm i'm just thinking uh re real
320:46 - quick i'm just thinking how much we
320:48 - should add um
320:50 - let's stick to to these grid lines for
320:52 - for this particular example then i'm
320:54 - going to create a rectangle
320:58 - um and my rectangle is going to be like
321:00 - so so i'm just kind of drawing around
321:03 - the
321:04 - the building
321:05 - right uh and i'm going to extend so i'll
321:09 - select the rectangle i'll extend
321:13 - these lines
321:15 - to that rectangle so that they penetrate
321:18 - through the building completely
321:22 - like that
321:23 - and also i will trim
321:27 - the lines that are extending away from
321:29 - the rectangle
321:32 - like that once i've done that i just can
321:35 - delete the rectangle all together so
321:37 - that's my that's my grid lines and they
321:40 - will have
321:43 - some sort of a markup at the at the end
321:46 - where i can then kind of say what kind
321:48 - of grid lines i'm using so i will just
321:51 - use a
321:52 - let's just do a polyline and let's just
321:54 - say the length is
321:57 - a mirror now a mirror is too much
322:00 - 500 millimeters uh by
322:04 - tens too
322:05 - too little 50.
322:08 - sure 500 by 50.
322:13 - it's kind of a stylized ending for the
322:17 - for the grid line and from the smith
322:19 - point i will just kind of move it to the
322:21 - first grid line here and i'll kind of
322:24 - copy it to all other positions
322:28 - like that
322:29 - take both of these
322:32 - copy them
322:33 - to the other side
322:36 - uh like so and same thing for the
322:40 - vertical ones i'll just borrow this
322:43 - like so i will rotate it
322:48 - or not rotate
322:51 - around this point vertical there we go
322:54 - um move to the first one from midpoint
322:59 - to end point here
323:01 - copy
323:03 - copy
323:05 - enter
323:07 - and there we go we just kind of go to
323:09 - town
323:11 - with them
323:12 - like that
323:15 - copy
323:16 - from the top midpoint to the bottom end
323:19 - point of the grid lines
323:22 - let's make sure that everything fits in
323:24 - the plan everything does fit in the plan
323:26 - that's great let's go back here um so
323:28 - that's our our gridlines they do need
323:31 - markups uh basically
323:35 - naming for for the gridlines so i will
323:37 - borrow this text
323:42 - yeah this this
323:44 - section markup text i'll just copy it
323:48 - near the first horizontal grid line
323:51 - something like so
323:56 - let's go for below it right and actually
323:59 - that text here can be smaller so i'll
324:01 - just scale it
324:03 - scale it down by 0.5
324:06 - to a pretty small text let's just double
324:09 - check how it looks like it's pretty
324:11 - small but that's fine
324:13 - and it's basically going to be
324:15 - horizontally i'm going to have grid line
324:18 - a and b and vertically i'm going to have
324:20 - 1 two three four five right so you
324:24 - always
324:25 - distinguish between directions by naming
324:28 - and the naming is alphabetical in one
324:31 - direction and in the other one it's
324:33 - numbers usually use numbers for the
324:36 - direction which has more grid lines as
324:38 - well
324:40 - so i'll just copy
324:42 - a
324:43 - a
324:46 - a
324:48 - a
324:49 - and this one i will just change to b
324:53 - uh the axle doesn't need to have a grid
324:56 - line
324:57 - uh to have any grid lines or any
325:00 - dimensions whatsoever so a grid line b
325:03 - grid line that's great
325:04 - same thing for these guys right here
325:07 - i'll just kind of
325:09 - take this
325:11 - copy this
325:14 - somewhere close by doesn't need to be
325:16 - perfectly precise i'll just rename this
325:18 - to one
325:21 - i'll just kind of make a copy of it
325:24 - so that's going to be one
325:26 - that's going to be two
325:27 - three
325:28 - four ah
325:30 - and stuff with the four
325:32 - copy
325:35 - four and
325:37 - five
325:40 - double click on the text
325:41 - rename it to two
325:44 - double click on the text rename it to
325:46 - three
325:48 - and the text
325:50 - four
325:52 - and the text
325:53 - five
325:55 - that's done
325:57 - now i just need to select these
325:59 - and copy them down
326:02 - copy
326:06 - um
326:07 - from here to
326:09 - here
326:10 - okay
326:11 - so we have our gridline markups done
326:15 - the grid lines themselves are still in
326:17 - the
326:18 - helper
326:19 - line layer so i need to fix that i will
326:22 - or axes i guess we need to call them
326:25 - axes
326:26 - sorry
326:28 - oh wait i'm not sorry it's it's both
326:30 - grid lines and axis in this case so i
326:34 - will select just the ends of them and i
326:36 - will change them to text layer so that
326:38 - the ends are going to be red and the
326:41 - axes themselves
326:43 - i'm going to create a new layer for them
326:47 - new layer and i'll call it axis
326:50 - or access
326:52 - doesn't matter axis and i'll
326:55 - here for now just change the color of
326:58 - them to be also well maybe not yellow
327:01 - maybe let's do orange
327:03 - right just to distinguish between them
327:06 - so these are going to be done in orange
327:10 - for now
327:11 - in the model space
327:12 - i just select them
327:14 - i messed that up
327:17 - there we go
327:18 - and we change this to
327:20 - axis layer there we go so that is done
327:23 - almost um
327:25 - if i look at it in the in the plan
327:28 - layout
327:29 - uh i can see the
327:31 - why is this
327:36 - that's strange it should be red right
327:39 - it's in the model space it's red
327:45 - oh sorry yeah the model space is in the
327:47 - green layer why is it here
327:51 - still shown as black
327:54 - just give me a second
327:56 - layer helper
327:58 - so it doesn't update
328:01 - what the hell
328:05 - that is a bug again
328:08 - that is super weird uh sure we can
328:11 - change them here
328:13 - uh while we are in the model space
328:16 - in the layout i can force them to be in
328:20 - the text
328:21 - layer
328:22 - i don't know why why that happens and
328:24 - now i messed it up i messed up the scale
328:27 - that's fine we just kind of zoom into it
328:30 - zoom enter z enter o enter zoom into it
328:35 - double click out
328:37 - select the
328:39 - frame properties and change the
328:43 - scale again to 1 to 50.
328:49 - it's so super strange that it doesn't
328:52 - wasn't isn't that reactive uh it didn't
328:55 - have this kind of bugs in previous
328:57 - versions uh i assume you will not have
329:00 - these bugs if you're working with an
329:01 - older version
329:03 - anyway um
329:04 - the lines themselves i want to change
329:07 - some properties of them so i'll go to or
329:10 - the axis lines i'll go to layer
329:11 - properties and here where i see axes
329:14 - first of all i'll change the color of
329:16 - them and i'll change the color to
329:18 - probably
329:20 - dark red
329:22 - color
329:24 - let's just hope that it kind of works oh
329:27 - [Music]
329:28 - need to be inside of the model space
329:32 - their properties here we change the the
329:35 - the axis layer
329:37 - color to dark red
329:41 - there we go
329:42 - uh so that is done but also
329:45 - while i'm at it i don't want this to be
329:47 - a solid line i want this to be a dashed
329:49 - line so i will mess around with the line
329:52 - type
329:54 - right
329:54 - the
329:55 - viewport
329:57 - or yeah viewport line type right so
330:00 - while i'm still here
330:02 - uh where i see vp line type i'll click
330:05 - on this continuous
330:07 - name here for the wait am i in the
330:10 - helper no for the axis continuous and
330:13 - i'll load a line type that i want and in
330:17 - this case for for these particular uh
330:20 - lines i want it to be dash
330:22 - dash dot
330:24 - long dash dot um that is
330:27 - used for the axes right so i'll just hit
330:30 - okay
330:31 - so now it got imported and we can use
330:34 - this line type right and i'll just
330:36 - choose it and
330:38 - use ok and now i can see that my line
330:41 - types
330:42 - have been updated and now they are dash
330:45 - dotted
330:47 - [Music]
330:48 - you can change the line type scale
330:52 - but i wouldn't suggest doing it if it
330:54 - works
330:56 - okay so we have this going on that's
330:59 - great let's jump into this section
331:04 - right here and we kind of need to add
331:06 - the grid lines to the section as well so
331:08 - i'll go back to the model space
331:10 - my battery ran out of the camera this is
331:14 - a long tutorial
331:15 - [Music]
331:16 - just give me a second
331:22 - new
331:23 - battery please
331:27 - there we go
331:29 - should be good
331:33 - so
331:35 - section right uh the the way you add uh
331:38 - gridlines to the section once you have
331:40 - them in the plan is super simple you
331:42 - just grab the ones that you already have
331:45 - made in the correct direction and you
331:48 - just copy them down
331:52 - uh perfectly down
331:55 - like so
331:56 - that's it that's done
331:58 - that's done because these are perfectly
332:00 - aligned right uh you will not be seeing
332:03 - gridlines a and b
332:05 - in this section
332:06 - naturally
332:08 - um then there's some change and here it
332:10 - actually updates i don't know
332:13 - so here we need to change the
332:17 - display as well of of these grid lines
332:20 - so i'll go to layer properties well
332:23 - double click layer properties and here i
332:26 - will just change from
332:27 - [Music]
332:29 - from the axis
332:33 - color
332:34 - to be
332:35 - that dark red color that i wanted
332:37 - and the line weight or line type vp line
332:41 - type
332:42 - i will change
332:44 - wait
332:45 - line type there we go vp line type i
332:47 - will change to dashed okay
332:51 - um
332:52 - that is done
332:54 - and that is it okay
332:57 - okay okay okay
333:00 - so
333:02 - we don't need to do anything with this
333:03 - this looks fine this looks fine oh yeah
333:06 - and double click out of it so that you
333:08 - don't accidentally zoom in
333:11 - to the drawing
333:14 - now one last thing
333:16 - before we plot everything out is adding
333:19 - dimensions
333:20 - and i'll start with the plan as per
333:22 - usual i'll create a new layer
333:24 - new layer
333:26 - called them
333:29 - just kind of
333:31 - name it them
333:33 - for dimensions and i will make it
333:36 - red in this case
333:38 - or
333:41 - we are using red color so let me make it
333:44 - uh
333:46 - orange we are using pink we are running
333:49 - out of colors here let's just have white
333:52 - then that's fine
333:54 - that's fine so dimensions is going to be
333:56 - done in
333:57 - white
333:58 - color
334:00 - uh let's find it dim
334:02 - there we go so dimensions one last thing
334:05 - right
334:06 - um
334:08 - if we go to the annotate tab
334:11 - here
334:13 - here we have the settings for our text
334:16 - for our dimensions and then and whatnot
334:18 - so there is um
334:22 - there are presets already so sorry the
334:25 - dimensions tab is right here right
334:27 - annotate tab dimension sub tab right
334:30 - here and there are preset dimensions
334:33 - that that we can see here
334:35 - and these are not that not that great
334:38 - we want to make our own so what i'm
334:41 - going to click on is this manage
334:44 - dimension style so again you click on
334:46 - this drop down box and you choose manage
334:48 - dimension styles right here
334:51 - which will give you this uh table
334:54 - where i can create a new
334:57 - dimension right and i'm gonna do that
334:59 - exactly that new
335:01 - i'll call it
335:02 - my
335:05 - pull
335:07 - them
335:08 - micro dimension
335:09 - uh and i'll start with uh whatever
335:12 - either standard or iso you do not start
335:14 - with annotative though that is something
335:16 - else
335:19 - do not tick mark annotative uh the way
335:22 - annotative works is uh
335:24 - as you're zooming out the dimensions
335:26 - will increase in size so they are kind
335:28 - of locked in size in terms of
335:30 - millimeters
335:31 - uh you don't really want that in this
335:34 - particular project in larger projects
335:36 - you do use annotate but
335:39 - that's going to be layer that's going to
335:41 - be much much later
335:43 - um
335:44 - use for all dimensions yes okay so
335:48 - do this hit continue
335:50 - and this is where you kind of set up all
335:54 - of your all of your dimensions so the
335:56 - first thing is color color is going to
335:58 - be
335:59 - uh by layer
336:01 - that's important
336:03 - so all of your dimensions are going to
336:05 - be colored by the layer in which they
336:06 - are in
336:07 - then line type is going to be by layer
336:10 - and line weight is going to be by layer
336:11 - so we are controlling the dimensions
336:13 - through layer
336:14 - not through block
336:17 - then you have baseline spacing if i
336:19 - change this to 500 for instance
336:22 - nothing happens
336:29 - whatever then we ignore it
336:31 - is it that bug again uh we'll see if
336:34 - it's a bug or not
336:35 - um
336:36 - you do have suppression though so
336:38 - suppression is if if you kind of change
336:41 - these things you can see what what
336:44 - changes here so if we suppress them
336:47 - lines both of them you don't see the
336:50 - the arrows anymore right so
336:52 - we don't want that to happen
336:55 - um
336:56 - extend beyond them lines uh that is this
336:59 - is by the way in millimeters so this is
337:01 - very very small
337:03 - uh if i change this to 10 you can see
337:06 - that
337:06 - these lines get extended uh much further
337:10 - so here i'm just going to say
337:12 - and this is where we're going to kind of
337:14 - start messing it up
337:16 - um
337:17 - for now let's keep it at 10. we will
337:19 - come back to this we will we will indeed
337:21 - come back to this everywhere where you
337:23 - see by block you change to by layer
337:27 - this is just the way you do it by layer
337:30 - right
337:31 - um
337:32 - we will come back to the extension
337:35 - in just a second also to the offset but
337:38 - for now i want to change the symbols so
337:41 - in architecture we don't use arrows we
337:43 - use
337:44 - dashes or ticks architectural ticks
337:47 - right so the arrowheads are
337:50 - architectural ticks the leader is
337:51 - architectural deck or the leader can be
337:54 - a dot as well that that's fine
337:56 - uh we can use a dot for the arrow size
337:59 - this is 2.5 millimeters in size that is
338:02 - way too small because you know this is
338:04 - like 400 millimeters thickness so we
338:06 - wanted the
338:07 - the tick mark to be around 100
338:10 - millimeters
338:11 - and now you can see how it messes up the
338:13 - view that's fine we will fix it
338:16 - uh center marks um
338:20 - that we we will not be working with
338:22 - center marks that's fine
338:24 - uh arc length symbol we don't care about
338:28 - anything else here
338:31 - yeah so it's just these these four
338:33 - things here uh then for the text we will
338:36 - change the text height so the text
338:38 - height right now is again oh by the way
338:40 - text color by layer
338:42 - right
338:43 - um
338:44 - text height we will change this to
338:48 - higher uh text of course
338:51 - and we will use something around
338:54 - um i want to say 75 millimeters
338:58 - i'll just do 75 and now we can see that
339:00 - we are back back in business right so so
339:02 - it's it's kind of
339:04 - um
339:05 - back to what it was uh before text
339:08 - placement um i do want to offset it from
339:12 - so it needs to be above the
339:15 - uh and centered to the dimension line uh
339:18 - but i do want it to be offsetted above
339:21 - it a little bit more so i'll just give
339:22 - it like if the text size is 75 uh let's
339:26 - just offset it by 25. so it's kind of it
339:30 - has a gap here um text alignment aligned
339:33 - with dimension line perfect that's
339:35 - that's fine nothing else nothing else
339:37 - here fit
339:38 - for the fit
339:45 - over the only thing that i change is
339:47 - text placement if it doesn't fit uh in
339:50 - the dimensions it needs to be over the
339:53 - dimension line with a leader
339:55 - um it's basically if if
339:58 - text doesn't fit here then it's going to
340:00 - kind of draw this this line here
340:03 - um
340:04 - like an angled line and it will show a
340:06 - text somewhere else
340:09 - um then here you can see that it's like
340:12 - full num it's not full numbers it's with
340:14 - a comma and we are dealing with
340:17 - millimeters so we don't uh we don't do
340:20 - this
340:22 - we need to kind of show only full
340:24 - numbers
340:25 - uh so under primary units where it says
340:28 - precision i will change the precision to
340:31 - zero
340:32 - so it only gives us full numbers
340:35 - okay so we have that done tolerances we
340:37 - don't care about alternative units we
340:39 - don't care about do we care about
340:41 - anything else here
340:44 - no no we don't okay back to lines tab
340:47 - um under extended dumb lines i had it as
340:51 - 10 so 10 now is super small i will have
340:54 - it as hundred
340:57 - so the ticks extend
340:59 - the dimensionless extent by a hundred
341:02 - all right i think that's it i think that
341:05 - is it that's all we need to do
341:08 - let me double check yeah everything
341:10 - seems fine i'll just hit ok
341:13 - uh my cool dimension is now my
341:15 - new created dimensional style i'll click
341:18 - close i'll make sure that it's my active
341:21 - dimensional style here and now i can
341:23 - start adding dimensions
341:25 - so
341:27 - in the top
341:29 - and on the side
341:32 - here
341:32 - i want to add dimensions
341:36 - and also i kind of want to anchor the
341:38 - dimensions to somewhere maybe the corner
341:41 - here or maybe that this intersection
341:43 - between one and a is going to be my
341:45 - anchoring point
341:47 - that's fine um
341:49 - so these guys will have dimensions
341:52 - anchored to the
341:55 - axes
341:56 - while on this side i can just kind of
341:58 - add some some additional dimensions here
342:01 - and there that that i want to
342:03 - uh that i want to showcase maybe i won't
342:06 - maybe just for the windows
342:08 - um
342:09 - let's do it so
342:10 - my cooldim is my active dimension and
342:13 - here i have two options for the
342:15 - dimension styles well there's actually
342:17 - more options here because if you want an
342:20 - aligned dimension you can have that as
342:21 - well
342:23 - i will show you all of them or at least
342:26 - three of them
342:27 - so linear dimension is basically if i
342:30 - click on it
342:32 - and i click on first point click on the
342:35 - second point
342:36 - drag it out
342:40 - you know that that's that is a linear
342:43 - linear dimension so the thing about
342:45 - linear dimension is that it can only go
342:49 - either horizontally or vertically
342:53 - right it can't go at an angle if i want
342:56 - it at an angle i need to use what's
342:59 - called an aligned dimension where is it
343:03 - where is it
343:05 - where is it
343:07 - ah there it is okay so uh
343:10 - we click on the small icon right next to
343:12 - linear dimension expand it and we can
343:15 - see aligned dimension here if i select
343:17 - aligned and i click click then it
343:20 - creates this
343:21 - angled dimension right so
343:24 - for this particular building we won't
343:26 - need any aligned dimensions just know
343:28 - that you can have those
343:31 - i will just be using linear
343:33 - linear
343:34 - from here to here
343:36 - and
343:37 - if you want to have
343:39 - if you don't want to kind of keep
343:41 - repeating the dimension command you can
343:43 - use uh continue
343:46 - this
343:49 - pool right here which basically just
343:52 - will continue on from the last dimension
343:54 - that you've done
343:55 - and you can just kind of then only click
343:58 - once and once you're done you just hit
344:00 - enter
344:01 - and it's going to add the dimensions
344:03 - right so then i'm usually the way i do
344:05 - it is i create a single linear dimension
344:07 - and then if i want to continue from it i
344:10 - just click on continue and then do it
344:12 - that way
344:13 - now for the
344:16 - uh
344:17 - for some additional anchoring i will do
344:22 - i will do a linear dimension between the
344:25 - corner of the building to the axis one
344:29 - that is going to be 400 millimeters then
344:31 - i'll continue it until the start of the
344:36 - um of the window
344:38 - generally here and then i'll kind of
344:40 - continue it
344:42 - all the way through
344:44 - to the end of the building like so
344:47 - so now i have registered these two
344:49 - corner points here and also the position
344:51 - of the window according to those two
344:53 - corner points and i'll do the same thing
344:55 - here a single linear dimension from here
344:58 - to here
344:59 - or sorry my bad
345:01 - first of all from here to here
345:04 - then continue it until here
345:06 - here
345:08 - and actually just until here we don't
345:11 - need to anchor it to to here or do we
345:13 - well maybe we can why not
345:17 - so that's done
345:18 - that is done if we look at it in the
345:21 - plan view
345:22 - that is how it looks like
345:24 - and again in the plan view it's not
345:27 - showing oh yeah that's fine it doesn't
345:30 - need to show up
345:32 - as
345:33 - as red for now but i will double click
345:36 - inside
345:37 - i will go to the layer properties tab
345:40 - and for dimensions i will change their
345:43 - color to red
345:45 - like that
345:48 - okay so that's done that is done
345:51 - now
345:52 - for the
345:53 - section so for this section you
345:56 - typically you do have dimensions here
345:58 - but since this is such a small project i
346:00 - will not be adding them but you what you
346:02 - do have is you have elevations right uh
346:06 - you mark out
346:07 - different
346:08 - uh altitudes for for different things so
346:12 - we won't have a lot of elevations here
346:14 - we will have one here
346:16 - um i'll i'll just kind of draw lines
346:19 - here
346:20 - um there's gonna be an elevation here
346:24 - um
346:25 - and i want an elevation here but that
346:27 - doesn't really matter
346:30 - and an elevation here
346:38 - well yeah and uh elevation showing
346:40 - what's what's zero what what do we
346:42 - consider to be
346:44 - considered to be zero right
346:47 - so
346:49 - these are the elevations that i want to
346:51 - mark out and for that i first need a
346:52 - markup of the elevations so there are
346:55 - different styles of markups uh the one
346:57 - that i like using is this so we start
347:00 - drawing from the horizontal line and
347:02 - i'll just do like 500 mil
347:05 - uh that's too too large let's do
347:08 - 250 millimeters like so so we just have
347:11 - like this horizontal line that's uh 250
347:15 - millimeters then i'm gonna draw down
347:18 - by
347:18 - uh
347:20 - let's say
347:21 - 50 millimeters
347:23 - like that this is going to be my helper
347:25 - line and this is enough for me to kind
347:27 - of
347:28 - this amount of lines is enough for me to
347:30 - draw out my markup so let me do it real
347:33 - fast online tool from this
347:37 - left hand side point to the end to the
347:39 - bottom
347:40 - then we move across up
347:44 - like that and we extend it like so
347:48 - right so this is you can treat this fall
347:51 - line basically as an arrow
347:54 - showing like looking downwards right and
347:57 - then i'm just gonna borrow a number
348:01 - here
348:04 - since i already have it
348:06 - move
348:07 - like that
348:09 - and i'm just going to kind of change the
348:12 - the layer of the number to
348:13 - dimensions double click on it and change
348:17 - change it to plus
348:20 - x point x xx
348:23 - or three x's right
348:25 - uh that is how
348:28 - altitudes are written while dimensions
348:30 - are written in millimeters altitudes are
348:33 - always written in meters with three
348:35 - digits after the comma this is how you
348:38 - distinguish between what's an altitude
348:39 - and what's an elevation
348:41 - or what's a dimension writer
348:43 - so let me copy this
348:45 - from this point i will want to show this
348:48 - point here i want to show this point
348:50 - here i will want to show this point here
348:52 - and you can see the graphical uh
348:54 - problems that we will have i will fix
348:56 - them
348:57 - i will want to show this point here
349:00 - uh point on the ground
349:03 - and this point right here right so let's
349:06 - get rid of the helper lines now
349:09 - like that that that
349:12 - no no need for that that
349:15 - that and that oh and that
349:18 - and now let's start
349:20 - kind of cleaning everything up so this
349:23 - guy right here uh intersects with the
349:25 - building so we don't want that i will
349:26 - just move it to the side and i will
349:28 - create one more line segment
349:30 - that kind of does its thing like so
349:36 - and for this one the same thing but
349:38 - in this case it doesn't need to extend
349:40 - too much a little bit more
349:43 - like that
349:45 - line
349:46 - segment drag it out like so
349:49 - everything else is okay um everything
349:52 - else is not in the way so now let's add
349:55 - the numbers right so always the floor
349:58 - plate like the top of the floor is 0.000
350:02 - so it's neither plus nor minus it's
350:04 - actually plus minus
350:05 - right so i will
350:09 - how do you
350:10 - [Music]
350:15 - i forgot how to insert a special
350:18 - character oh no
350:23 - well if if you don't uh
350:28 - if you can't use a special character you
350:30 - can always do this plus minus
350:33 - that works as well 0.000
350:37 - right that is our
350:39 - starting elevation and that is our floor
350:42 - plate then i know that this is
350:45 - let me just actually i don't let me
350:47 - measure the distance
350:49 - this is
350:51 - 1.1 meters above the floor plate right
350:54 - so this is going to be plus
350:57 - 1.100
350:59 - right
351:00 - that's that's the altitude and this one
351:02 - is going to be again measured distance
351:05 - from here to here
351:07 - 2750
351:09 - so it's going to be plus 2 pounds two
351:12 - point seven five zero
351:15 - then here we will have probably
351:18 - i'll just measure this seven hundred
351:20 - so three four five zero
351:26 - three four
351:31 - feels weird wait is it really three four
351:33 - five zero
351:37 - uh yes it is okay
351:39 - and then this height right here
351:44 - distance
351:45 - from let's see this line to
351:48 - here
351:49 - two three zero zero
351:55 - plus two point three
351:58 - zero zero
352:00 - and the last one here it's going to be
352:03 - i remember i just moved it by five
352:05 - centimeters down so it's going to be
352:06 - negative right
352:09 - minus 0.050
352:12 - that's it that's that's all of the
352:15 - all of the elevations let's look at them
352:17 - in this section that's how they look
352:18 - like in this section and i want to
352:20 - change their their colors in the section
352:22 - as well so i'll
352:23 - go to layer properties double click
352:25 - don't forget to double click go to layer
352:27 - properties dimension
352:29 - and here just change it to whatever
352:31 - color we're using we are using red
352:34 - color for these markups double click out
352:39 - we're good to go
352:41 - okay so we have our plan we have our
352:43 - section and all of them have
352:46 - dimensions
352:48 - okay last thing
352:51 - last thing to do
352:53 - is to actually plot this out right to
352:57 - create a pdf
352:59 - or actually let me
353:02 - i'm now scared that i'm rushing and i
353:05 - will forget something important so
353:07 - let me just
353:10 - double check
353:18 - match properties okay that's that's one
353:20 - that that we can that i can show you as
353:22 - well uh one last
353:24 - trick i guess if you have let's say
353:28 - a line here right
353:32 - come on align
353:34 - right and it's in dimensions layer and
353:36 - you want to change its layer you can
353:38 - match
353:39 - match properties m a
353:43 - shortcut for it is m a and then you
353:45 - choose source object so let's see this
353:47 - guy right here
353:49 - right and then you just click on the
353:53 - object to which you want to match the
353:55 - properties to
353:56 - like that and it's going to
354:00 - move it in the same layer as the source
354:03 - and change its all of the properties to
354:06 - be the same of the source usually it's
354:08 - used for hatches
354:10 - if i have
354:11 - [Music]
354:13 - if i have a hatch
354:15 - you know something like this and i want
354:17 - to make it exactly the same as this i
354:20 - can match properties
354:22 - m a enter from this hatch to this hedge
354:25 - right so it just kind of
354:27 - matches these two hatches together quite
354:29 - useful quite a useful little tool
354:32 - um
354:33 - no we are not still plotting it out i
354:35 - haven't told you about the
354:40 - i haven't done one last
354:42 - thing
354:44 - which is adding dashed lines
354:47 - here we won't have any dashed lines will
354:49 - we
354:52 - almost nothing is above
354:54 - but here here we will have a dashed line
354:58 - because there's a like a cupboard above
355:01 - and that cupboard is going to be
355:03 - a little bit thinner than the
355:07 - than the
355:08 - block here
355:10 - so i'm going to
355:12 - create a new layer and i'll
355:15 - change to
355:16 - dashed
355:17 - so this layer will have all of the
355:19 - dashed lines i'll change the dashed
355:21 - lines color to also yellow let's let's
355:24 - go for yellow that's fine and
355:27 - in the line type i will change actually
355:29 - i will change it here in the line type i
355:31 - will change it to
355:34 - load it and i'll change it to just iso
355:36 - dash okay
355:38 - choose it okay and now we have a dash
355:41 - layer that's yellow and that has a line
355:43 - type of the dash right
355:46 - the dash
355:47 - um
355:48 - so now in that layer
355:50 - next layer i'll just create a polyline
355:53 - here
355:54 - that's going to go all the way to here
355:58 - and we'll
356:00 - actually we can kind of do this
356:03 - that would look pretty cool
356:06 - now let's stick to it um
356:08 - 350 let's see
356:12 - like that
356:14 - that
356:15 - so this is basically a cupboard above
356:17 - and you can see it's it's dashed but the
356:19 - dash is very very thin uh let's see if
356:22 - it's actually so thin in the plan here
356:26 - and it's not right that's because well
356:29 - you don't really see it do it's super
356:32 - yellow so let me change the
356:34 - color of it to black
356:39 - there we go
356:41 - so it is dashed here right
356:44 - oh
356:47 - i stood up
356:49 - by the way if if you can't zoom out or
356:52 - click out of the model space as you're
356:54 - in the viewport
356:56 - you can always click here where it says
356:58 - model you can click
357:00 - click on it and then you are going to be
357:02 - in the paper space right so you don't
357:04 - necessarily need to click out so let me
357:08 - fix this again
357:10 - one
357:11 - z enter oh enter
357:14 - double click out uh select this
357:18 - properties
357:20 - keep messing it up i just keep messing
357:22 - it up one two fifty
357:27 - what's that that's done okay
357:30 - so now that's that's a dashed line right
357:33 - there
357:36 - last thing
357:38 - thicknesses
357:40 - right everything right now is the same
357:42 - thickness
357:43 - we don't want that we want the
357:45 - thicknesses to be different and i will
357:48 - use global values rather than local
357:50 - values for thicknesses so i'll do that
357:52 - in the model space rather than
357:54 - individually i or separately in every
357:57 - layout so i'll go to the layer
358:00 - properties
358:01 - tab here and
358:03 - thicknesses are controlled through line
358:05 - weights
358:07 - so
358:08 - the thinnest line that you can have
358:11 - which still
358:13 - prints out by most of the
358:16 - plotters
358:17 - is 0.09 millimeters
358:20 - anything
358:21 - thinner than that
358:22 - uh some older printers will have
358:25 - problems with it and by older i mean
358:27 - printers that are used a lot
358:30 - uh so in the school for instance
358:32 - um
358:33 - [Music]
358:35 - anything lower than 0.09 will not print
358:38 - out that well
358:41 - when i see 0.09 i mean 0.09 millimeters
358:45 - so those will not print out that well
358:47 - uh so instead
358:49 - uh we are going to lock our smallest
358:52 - distance or smallest thickness of the
358:54 - line to 0.09
358:57 - um and then everything
358:59 - the size that we will kind of keep
359:01 - increasing in in thickness
359:04 - in regards to that
359:07 - there's something else that i wanted to
359:08 - mention
359:10 - all right if you're printing with white
359:13 - lines
359:14 - above
359:15 - uh black background so white on black
359:19 - then your thickness of the lines needs
359:21 - to be a little bit thicker
359:24 - because
359:25 - there is a little bit of color bleed
359:28 - right off of the black color so
359:32 - if if your lines are too thin they will
359:34 - get eaten up so if you're printing with
359:37 - white on black i would suggest
359:40 - smallest
359:42 - line thickness to be 0.12
359:45 - millimeters rather than 0.09
359:49 - so here with the line weights let's
359:51 - let's go to town with them so axes axes
359:54 - are usually
359:56 - very thin so i'll use 0.09 on them
360:01 - dashed line is also a thin one i'll use
360:05 - 0.09
360:07 - definition points i have no idea what
360:09 - those are we ignore them
360:11 - dimension
360:13 - dimension lines are usually a little bit
360:15 - thicker
360:16 - so i'll use 0.13
360:19 - hatch
360:21 - depends on your style but i prefer using
360:24 - very thin lines 0.09
360:27 - helper we are not using helper layer
360:30 - we're not printing with the helper layer
360:32 - so we don't care
360:33 - inner
360:35 - that's inner lines for the
360:37 - trees
360:38 - those can be super thin
360:40 - [Music]
360:42 - 0.09
360:45 - then we have layout text
360:47 - that can be
360:49 - a little bit thicker 0.15
360:54 - medium line thickness needs to be
360:57 - thicker than all of these
360:59 - so i'll choose 0.2
361:03 - no print that's important remember we
361:05 - created the no print layer
361:08 - that one shouldn't be printed so we
361:09 - control it through the line weights we
361:11 - scroll down
361:13 - we don't scroll down we scroll up and we
361:16 - see 0.00
361:18 - right that's the no print
361:21 - basically lines that don't have any
361:22 - thickness
361:23 - so no print will have 0.00
361:27 - outer line
361:28 - for these things will probably be medium
361:32 - so like the same as medium so i will use
361:35 - 0.2
361:37 - uh text
361:39 - uh text can be
361:42 - somewhere in between
361:46 - something close to dimensions so
361:48 - dimensions are 0.13 so let's use that
361:51 - 0.13 for the text
361:54 - thick lines
361:55 - i will go for 0.4
361:58 - so double the thickness of the outer
362:00 - lines and thin lines are of course 10
362:03 - 0.09
362:05 - um
362:06 - yeah let's see
362:08 - let's take a let's take a look uh you
362:11 - can't really see it here
362:13 - we need to start uh plotting it out for
362:15 - you to actually
362:16 - for you to actually see it right
362:19 - um so let's plot everything out
362:21 - uh shortcut for plotting stuff out or
362:24 - exporting pdfs is p
362:27 - no
362:28 - i lie it's not p
362:31 - just write plot
362:32 - i guess
362:33 - plot enter
362:34 - [Music]
362:36 - um
362:38 - it will ask you for this we noticed that
362:41 - you have multiple drawings
362:43 - um it's available for plotting multiple
362:45 - sheets at once what do you want to do so
362:47 - you can either plot out
362:50 - all of them at once
362:53 - or you can plot them out one by one
362:55 - for this particular purpose i will be
362:58 - plotting them out one by one just so
363:00 - that i can show you how you can combine
363:02 - them with the
363:03 - online tools into one pdf right so
363:09 - i will say continue to plot a single
363:10 - sheet right but you can use
363:13 - try batch plot
363:15 - you can use that as well so i'll
363:17 - continue
363:19 - it's going to kind of give me this plot
363:22 - settings again and i can actually click
363:24 - on preview here
363:27 - to see how it's going to look like
363:32 - produced by autodesk student version
363:35 - great
363:36 - um
363:37 - so yeah that's that's education version
363:41 - right there uh so we are going to be
363:44 - plotting out this
363:45 - right
363:46 - um i i just click the close button i hit
363:50 - okay
363:55 - and i'll just plot it to my desktop let
363:57 - me just create a new folder here i'll
364:00 - just call it plot raw
364:05 - plot raw
364:08 - why are you crashing again
364:11 - [Music]
364:14 - location is not available it is it's
364:16 - right here
364:17 - oh my god
364:18 - um
364:19 - pdf document sure i'll call it uh we're
364:23 - plotting out the plan so i'll just call
364:24 - it plan
364:26 - hit save
364:29 - and it's done uh and i can kind of take
364:32 - a look at it
364:33 - right here desktop plot raw
364:37 - plan
364:39 - double click that
364:41 - for some reason to rotate it that's
364:42 - whatever that why is it rotated
364:46 - you shouldn't be rotated
364:49 - don't be weird
364:52 - let's see
364:55 - it's lansky format
365:07 - that's fine
365:14 - what if i use a different
365:16 - lighting technique adobe pdf
365:22 - and i plot it this way
365:28 - i'm just kind of checking what what
365:30 - works more stable at this point
365:33 - so i'll overwrite it and i need to close
365:36 - this to be able to override it
365:39 - let's see if adobe pdf will will do as
365:42 - good
365:45 - definitely slower definitely slower
365:49 - come on you can do it it's not a big
365:51 - project
365:55 - oh my god man oh there we go it's also
365:58 - rotated okay so that's weird but that's
366:00 - fine uh we can have it rotated that's
366:03 - okay
366:04 - um
366:05 - so we have that
366:07 - then let's do the section by the way
366:08 - shortcut even
366:10 - faster shortcut is ctrl p
366:13 - uh continue
366:15 - plot
366:16 - i'll just use the regular one hit ok
366:20 - uh that's section
366:22 - save
366:25 - and then for axo ctrl p
366:28 - plot
366:30 - a3
366:31 - okay
366:34 - exo
366:36 - save
366:38 - and of course you will have a
366:39 - you will have more you will have the
366:41 - title page as well but
366:43 - not i'm
366:46 - i'm curious to see what you'll come up
366:47 - with so
366:49 - i will not be showing you the title page
366:51 - uh let me just save this file just just
366:53 - in case it crashes again
366:56 - um so we have these three
366:58 - we have the plan
367:00 - right here we have the axo
367:03 - right here
367:04 - and we have the
367:06 - section which i mispronounced right here
367:10 - right everything seems to be in order
367:13 - even though it's it's a little bit messy
367:15 - then what you can do honestly like
367:19 - i shouldn't probably be showing you this
367:21 - but what you can do is you can open them
367:23 - up in photoshop
367:26 - let me just quickly
367:28 - really quickly
367:30 - show you how to kind of connect this to
367:32 - the previous
367:34 - previous course that we had
367:37 - so let's open up photoshop
367:39 - um
367:39 - [Music]
367:40 - i'll just take all three of these
367:43 - drag and drop them in
367:45 - as copies
367:47 - and i will
367:49 - as as i have drawn
367:51 - dropped them in it's going to ask me for
367:53 - how do i want to import this very
367:55 - important to have media box
367:58 - set
367:58 - as cropping
368:00 - rather than bounding box that's very
368:02 - important everything else is whatever
368:04 - hit okay
368:08 - then here media box okay
368:11 - and here media box okay so we have now
368:14 - them opened up in photoshop which means
368:16 - that here i can mess around with them i
368:18 - can go to image image rotation
368:22 - counterclockwise
368:25 - image image oops that's kind of a size
368:27 - that's bad image image rotation
368:30 - counterclockwise
368:32 - image
368:33 - image rotation counterclockwise so i
368:35 - have them like rotated back to to normal
368:38 - orientation and i also can add like
368:42 - create a new layer drag it below the
368:45 - existing layer uh grab the white color
368:48 - shift f5 to fill
368:51 - and and basically just create white
368:53 - background that way i'm going to do the
368:55 - the same thing for for all of them
368:58 - like that
369:03 - like that and also i can while i'm at it
369:06 - i can come in here and i can kind of
369:08 - select the autodesk
369:11 - student version then you can just
369:14 - no no no this was done with a
369:16 - professional version right don't
369:21 - no no no it's it's a normal professional
369:24 - version oops
369:26 - uh ctrl d
369:28 - or ctrl z
369:30 - ctrl z
369:31 - there we go
369:32 - uh this one will need a little bit more
369:35 - precision
369:36 - and up
369:40 - believe that
369:41 - a little bit of crap is left there but
369:44 - the teacher will not notice trust me
369:47 - delete that
369:54 - delete that
369:56 - and the last one delete that okay so
369:59 - that is cleaned up
370:00 - while i'm here i can kinda oh you can
370:03 - still see a little bit of the border no
370:06 - no no
370:08 - we delete the border
370:12 - there we go
370:15 - so i messed up a little bit there
370:16 - apparently
370:18 - that particular plotting technique still
370:20 - keeps
370:22 - like a tiny bit of the border that's
370:24 - fine uh there's also an option for you
370:26 - to
370:27 - um
370:28 - go in here
370:29 - where is it
370:31 - going here select this object and i
370:33 - believe
370:35 - there needs to be
370:45 - there needs to be like no print option
370:47 - here yeah there we go so there's also
370:50 - like this whole segment here where we
370:52 - can change
370:54 - [Music]
370:55 - the border
370:57 - the no print layer to be
371:00 - actually
371:01 - no print
371:04 - like so
371:05 - right if you click on this it's not
371:07 - going to be printed out
371:09 - that's something uh to to to know so
371:12 - it's either changing it to 0.000
371:15 - millimeters in thickness or not printing
371:16 - it out altogether apparently
371:19 - uh
371:20 - 0.000 doesn't always work which is news
371:24 - to me
371:25 - it used to work
371:27 - i feel old
371:29 - um
371:30 - oh yeah axel we need to clean up the
371:32 - axle
371:33 - delete that
371:35 - delete that
371:37 - delete that nope
371:38 - i am deleting the wrong things
371:44 - or rather the long wrong layer
371:48 - there we go there we go
371:50 - [Music]
371:51 - there we go
371:52 - and now
371:54 - precision
371:58 - decision there we go
372:00 - good enough
372:01 - good enough um
372:03 - what else can we do with this
372:06 - i don't really want to do anything more
372:07 - with this uh you could while you're in
372:10 - photoshop you could kind of add color
372:12 - texture or whatnot to it but i don't
372:15 - really want to do it what i want to do
372:17 - is
372:21 - clean this bad boy up
372:25 - so this is actually
372:26 - this shows very well the difference
372:28 - between
372:29 - vector graphics and raster graphics see
372:32 - how the
372:34 - the lines are not infinite in resolution
372:36 - anymore
372:37 - uh this is because we're dealing with
372:39 - them in photoshop
372:40 - right
372:41 - and photoshop works with pixels
372:44 - so these three are now cleaned up i'll
372:46 - just save them just ctrl s
372:49 - to save
372:51 - i choose photoshop pdf i'll go to my
372:55 - desktop
372:57 - plot raw and i'll just kind of override
372:59 - them or let's just do exo
373:02 - clean
373:03 - like that i will not be saving the layer
373:05 - so i'll untick that i'll hit save
373:08 - hit ok
373:10 - everything else here is fine
373:13 - hit save
373:16 - and same thing here
373:19 - pdf
373:23 - plan
373:26 - clean
373:27 - no layers
373:29 - save
373:34 - section
373:37 - uh
373:38 - pdf
373:42 - section clean
373:44 - now layer save okay
373:47 - we are almost there last thing
373:51 - is combining them so you can either
373:53 - combine them with
373:54 - adobe
373:56 - pdf by just kind of selecting all three
373:59 - of them
374:00 - or acrobat reader
374:02 - selecting all three of them right
374:04 - clicking on them
374:06 - and choosing combined files in acrobat
374:09 - so if you don't have that option
374:13 - right if you don't have that option then
374:15 - you
374:16 - then then then you need to use the
374:19 - website combine pdfs online which is
374:21 - also super super neat uh drop your files
374:24 - here uh exo plan
374:27 - exo plan section
374:30 - there we go drag and drop them in
374:35 - it's uploading
374:37 - uploading it's done and now i can kind
374:40 - of arrange them so first i want the plan
374:43 - then i want the section then i want the
374:45 - axo and then i just click on combine
374:48 - and now it's downloaded here
374:50 - go in folder
374:54 - my computer is just
374:56 - not up to par
374:59 - one
375:00 - you can do it it's just opening a folder
375:03 - there we go so we have that and
375:07 - i'll just add it to
375:09 - [Music]
375:11 - to the plot raw for folder sure and i'll
375:14 - say
375:15 - aada05
375:18 - geridekis
375:21 - get the minus
375:24 - right
375:24 - then i will
375:26 - i can either email it to myself and
375:30 - use the
375:32 - use they used to use the
375:33 - [Music]
375:38 - how is it called remote student desktop
375:40 - to login to one of the computers and
375:43 - open up the email from the the computer
375:46 - in the school and upload it to the
375:50 - to the server from there which is a
375:52 - viable solution and super easy to do or
375:56 - i can just simply
375:58 - if if you are a little bit more
376:00 - technology
376:02 - focused i guess uh you can just connect
376:05 - to
376:05 - the vpn blendvpn and then you will have
376:08 - access to the servers this is a little
376:11 - bit harder to do though
376:12 - but then you just
376:14 - kind of go to the thumb folder
376:18 - unprotected
376:20 - and in
376:22 - and you just simply
376:27 - drag and drop in your
376:30 - your file
376:34 - that's it you have successfully finished
376:36 - the course
376:38 - right
376:39 - let's look at the file
376:42 - let's look at the file this is how it
376:44 - looks like the thicknesses of the lines
376:46 - are okay they're not not spectacular but
376:49 - they are fine i would probably if i
376:51 - needed to
376:53 - kind of
376:54 - readjust them i would probably
376:56 - um
376:57 - increase the thickness in some cases
376:59 - let's look at it at a hundred percent i
377:01 - would increase the thicknesses and then
377:03 - in in certain cases the hash is fine the
377:06 - thin lines could be a little bit thicker
377:09 - though
377:09 - and the medium line could be a little
377:11 - bit thicker other than that this is okay
377:14 - that's the section section is okay
377:16 - section looks fine
377:18 - um and the axle looks great
377:24 - simple minimalist i like it
377:27 - [Music]
377:30 - right that is it that is it
377:33 - hope you
377:34 - will have fun finishing up the project i
377:37 - know it's a lot of information in the
377:39 - last uh
377:40 - last bit of of these tutorials but that
377:44 - is all of the information that you need
377:46 - to produce any kind of project honestly
377:50 - so
377:52 - that's great now once once you're done
377:54 - with the course you are full-fledged
377:55 - architects
377:57 - just kidding anyway
378:01 - go and have fun with the projects
378:03 - i'll see you next time
378:07 - [Music]
