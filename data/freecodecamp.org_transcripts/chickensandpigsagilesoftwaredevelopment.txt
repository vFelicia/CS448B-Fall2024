00:00 - Hi! My name is Chris Gagn√©, and I'm an Agile coach.
00:04 - Today, I will talk about chickens and pigs.
00:08 - Like chickens and pigs?
00:10 - What's it got to do with Agile?
00:12 - Well, here's the story:
00:13 - A Pig and a Chicken are 
walking down the road
00:16 - The Chicken says,
00:17 - "Hey Pig, I was thinking 
we should open a restaurant."
00:21 - Pig replies,
00:22 - "Hmm. Maybe. What would we call it?"
00:26 - And the Chicken responds,
00:27 - "How about Ham and Eggs?"
00:29 - The Pig thinks for a moment and says,
00:31 - "No thanks. I'd be committed, 
but you'd only be involved."
00:36 - So it's a story about how committed
 someone is to the cause.
00:40 - The ham requires the pig sacrifice
00:43 - while the chickens' eggs are easy to produce.
00:46 - Traditionally the development team were the pigs.
00:50 - While everyone else including: 
product owners, scrum masters, customers,
00:55 - and other stakeholders were chickens.
00:57 - The idea was that pigs got the priority
01:00 - for talking during team meetings
01:03 - Sometimes chickens were even expected 
to remain silent unless invited to speak
01:08 - because they weren't the ones 
who had their bacon on the line.
01:12 - Ken Schwaber, co-creator of Scrum,
01:15 - used to tell the story about chickens and pigs
01:18 - and it was even part of The Scrum Guide
01:20 - However, Ken and its co-creator Jeff Sutherland
01:25 - removed it from The Scrum Guide in 2011
01:28 - because it got a little too derogatory in practice.
01:32 - Developers might say something like
01:34 - The stakeholder can't talk to us during daily stand-up. They're just a chicken.
01:40 - It's true. We do want the development team to be able to focus on their meetings without getting derailed.
01:45 - But calling our leadership pea-brain birds 
isn't going to win us any favors.
01:51 - Since it hasn't been part of 
The Scrum Guide in quite a while,
01:54 - you may hear the term less and less often.
01:56 - That's perfectly okay.
01:58 - And it's still fine to use the term in your organization.
02:01 - Just don't use it as a chance to 
beat up on your stakeholders
02:05 - If you really think about it...
02:06 - We've all got our bacon on the line.
02:08 - Best of luck! Oink Oink
