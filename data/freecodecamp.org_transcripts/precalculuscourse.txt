00:18 - This video introduces functions and their
domains and ranges. A function is a correspondence
00:25 - between input numbers, usually the x values
and output numbers, usually the y values,
00:32 - that sends each input number to exactly one
output number. Sometimes a function is thought
00:38 - of as a rule or machine, in which you can
feed in x values as input and get out y values
00:48 - as output. So, non mathematical example of
a function might be the biological mother
00:54 - function, which takes as input and a person,
and it gives us output their biological mother.
01:02 - This function satisfies the condition that
each input number object person, in this case,
01:09 - get sent to exactly one output person. Because
if you take any person, they just have one
01:16 - biological mother. So that rule does give
you a function. But if I change things around,
01:23 - and just use the the mother function, which
sends to each person, their mother, that's
01:30 - no longer gonna be a function, because there
are some people who have more than one mother,
01:34 - right, they could have a biological mother
and adopted mother, or a mother and stepmother
01:39 - or any number of situations. So since there's,
there's at least some people who you would
01:44 - put it as input, and then you'd get like more
than one possible output that violates this,
01:50 - this rule of functions, that would not be
a function. Now, most of the time, we'll work
01:54 - with functions that are described with equations,
not in terms of mothers. So for example, we
01:59 - can have the function y equals x squared plus
one. This can also be written as f of x equals
02:06 - x squared plus one. Here, f of x is function
notation that stands for the output value
02:12 - of y. Notice that this notation is not representing
multiplication, we're not multiplying f by
02:20 - x, instead, we're going to be putting in a
value for access input and getting out a value
02:26 - of f of x or y. For example, if we want to
evaluate f of two, we're plugging in two as
02:34 - input for x either in this equation, or in
that equation. Since F of two means two squared
02:42 - plus one, f of two is going to equal five.
Similarly, f of five means I plug in five
02:51 - for x. So that's going to be five squared
plus one, or 26. Sometimes it's useful to
02:58 - evaluate a function on a more complicated
expression involving other variables. In this
03:03 - case, remember, the functions value on any
expression, it's just what you what you get
03:08 - when you plug in that whole expression for
x. So f of a plus three is going to be the
03:17 - quantity a plus three squared plus one, we
could rewrite that as a squared plus six a
03:25 - plus nine plus one, or a squared plus six
a plus 10. When evaluating a function on a
03:33 - complex expression, it's important to keep
the parentheses when you plug in for x. That
03:39 - way, you evaluate the function on the whole
expression. For example, it would be wrong
03:47 - to write f of a plus three equals a plus three
squared plus one without the parentheses,
03:55 - because that would imply we were just squaring
the three and not the whole expression, a
04:00 - plus three. Sometimes the function is described
with a graph instead of an equation. In this
04:09 - example, this graph is supposed to represent
the function g of x. Not all graphs actually
04:16 - represent functions. For example, the graph
of a circle doesn't represent a function.
04:22 - That's because the graph of a circle violates
the vertical line test, you can draw a vertical
04:27 - line, and I'll intersect the graph in more
than one point. But our graph it left satisfies
04:33 - the vertical line test, any vertical line
intersects the graph, and at most one point,
04:38 - that means is a function because every x value
will have at most one y value that corresponds
04:44 - to it. Let's evaluate gf two, note that two
is an x value. And we'll use the graph to
04:52 - find the corresponding y value. So I look
for two on the x axis and find the point on
04:59 - the graph. If that has that x value, that's
right here. Now I can look at the y value
05:06 - of that point looks like three, and therefore
g of two is equal to three. If I try to do
05:13 - the same thing to evaluate g of five, I run
into trouble. Five is an x value, I look for
05:19 - it on the x axis. But there's no point on
the graph that has that x value. Therefore,
05:27 - g of five is undefined, or we can say it does
not exist. The question of what x values and
05:34 - y values make sense for a function leads us
to a discussion of domain and range. The domain
05:40 - of a function is all possible x values that
make sense for that function. The range is
05:46 - the y values that makes sense for the function.
In this example, we saw that the x value of
05:51 - five didn't have a corresponding y value for
this function. So the x value of five is not
05:58 - in the domain of our function J. To find the
x values in the domain, we have to look at
06:04 - the x values that correspond to points on
the graph. One way to do that is to take the
06:09 - shadow or projection of the graph onto the
x axis and see what x values are hit. It looks
06:18 - like we're hitting all x values, starting
at negative eight, and continuing up to four.
06:25 - So our domain is the x's between negative
eight, and for including those endpoints,
06:33 - or we can write this in interval notation
as negative eight comma four with square brackets.
06:39 - To find the range of the function we look
for the y value is corresponding to points
06:44 - on this graph, we can do that by taking the
shadow or projection of the graph onto the
06:51 - y axis, we seem to be hitting our Y values
from negative five, up through three. So our
07:04 - range is wise between negative five and three
are an interval notation, negative five, three
07:13 - with square brackets. If we made a function
that's described as an equation instead of
07:18 - a graph, one way to find the domain and range
are to graph the function. But it's often
07:24 - possible to find the domain at least more
quickly, by using algebraic considerations.
07:30 - We think about what x values it makes sense
to plug into this expression, and what x values
07:34 - need to be excluded, because they make the
algebraic expression impossible to evaluate.
07:39 - Specifically, to find the domain of a function,
we need to exclude x values that make the
07:47 - denominator zero. Since we can't divide by
zero, we also need to exclude x values that
07:55 - make an expression inside a square root sign
negative. Since we can't take the square root
08:01 - of a negative number. In fact, we need to
exclude values that make an expression inside
08:05 - any even root negative because we can't take
an even root of a negative number, even though
08:11 - we can take an odd root like a cube root of
a negative number. Later, when we look at
08:17 - logarithmic functions, we'll have some additional
exclusions that we have to make. But for now,
08:22 - these two principles should handle all functions
We'll see. So let's apply them to a couple
08:27 - examples. For the function in part A, we don't
have any square root signs, but we do have
08:33 - a denominator. So we need to exclude x values
that make the denominator zero. In other words,
08:40 - we need x squared minus 4x plus three to not
be equal to zero. If we solve x squared minus
08:49 - 4x plus three equal to zero, we can do that
by factoring. And that gives us x equals three
08:56 - or x equals one, so we need to exclude these
values. All other x values should be fine.
09:03 - So if I draw the number line, I can put on
one and three and just dig out a hole at both
09:09 - of those. And my domain includes everything
else on the number line. In interval notation,
09:16 - this means my domain is everything from negative
infinity to one, together with everything
09:22 - from one to three, together with everything
from three to infinity. In the second example,
09:30 - we don't have any denominator to worry about,
but we do have a square root sign. So we need
09:35 - to exclude any x values that make three minus
2x less than zero. In other words, we can
09:43 - include all x values for which three minus
2x is greater than or equal to zero. Solving
09:50 - that inequality gives us three is greater
than or equal to 2x. In other words, x is
09:57 - less than or equal to three halves. If I can
draw this on the number line, or write it
10:04 - in interval notation, notice that three halves
is included. And that's because three minus
10:12 - 2x is allowed to be zero, I can take the square
root of zero, that's just zero. And that's
10:16 - not a problem. Finally, let's look at a more
complicated function that involves both the
10:22 - square root and his denominator. Now there
are two things I need to worry about. I need
10:28 - the denominator to not be equal to zero, and
I need the stuff inside the square root sign
10:36 - to be greater than or equal to zero. from
our earlier work, we know the first condition
10:41 - means that x is not equal to three, and x
is not equal to one. And the second condition
10:48 - means that x is less than or equal to three
halves. Let's draw both of those conditions
10:53 - on the number line. x is not equal to three
and x is not equal to one means we've got
11:00 - everything except those two dug out points.
And the other condition x is less than or
11:07 - equal to three halves means we can have three
halves, and everything to the left of it not
11:14 - to be in our domain. And to be legit for our
function, we need both of these conditions
11:18 - to be true. So I'm going to connect these
conditions with an and and that means we're
11:23 - looking for numbers on the number line that
are colored both red and blue. So I'll draw
11:28 - that above and purple. So that's everything
from three halves to one, I have to dig out
11:33 - one because one was a problem for the denominator.
And then I can continue for all the things
11:38 - that are colored both both colors red and
blue. So my final domain is going to be let's
11:45 - see negative infinity, up to but not including
one together with one, but not including it
11:53 - to three halves, and I include three half
since that was colored both red and blue.
11:58 - Also, in this video, we talked about functions,
how to evaluate them, and how to find domains
12:03 - and ranges. This video is a brief introduction
to increasing and decreasing functions based
12:10 - on their graphs. In this first example, I've
graphed two lines, the first line is an increasing
12:19 - function. Because as the x values go from
left to right, the y values are going up.
12:28 - this can be written more formally, by saying
if x two is bigger than x one, these are supposed
12:34 - to be x values. So that means that x two is
some x value, that's to the right so that
12:40 - it's bigger than x one. So whenever we have
an x value x to this bigger than x one, increasing
12:47 - means that f of x two has to be bigger than
f of x one, so that the y values are getting
12:57 - bigger when the x values are bigger. The second
line is an example of a decreasing function.
13:07 - Because here as the x values increased from
left to right, the y values are going down.
13:14 - So again, we can write this more formally
by saying that whenever we have an x value
13:20 - x two that's bigger than x one, for example,
this might be x two, and this might be x one,
13:26 - then the y value f of x two is less than f
of x one this time, because here, when we
13:36 - have a bigger x value, we want to have a smaller
y value to be decreasing. This second example
13:44 - gives the graph of a function that's increasing
in some places, but decreasing and others.
13:50 - This part of the graph, here the functions
decreasing, because as the x values increased
13:56 - from left to right, the y values go down.
Over here, we also have a part of the graph
14:03 - where the function is decreasing. Now this
part of the graph, the function is increasing,
14:09 - because as x goes from left to right, the
y values are going up. I've marked that one
14:15 - in green, for increasing. And finally, on
this part of the graph, the functions are
14:20 - neither increasing nor decreasing, it's completely
flat or constant. Now we're asked to describe
14:25 - the intervals on which the graph is increasing
or decreasing. So we describe those intervals
14:30 - in terms of the x values. It wouldn't make
sense to describe them in terms of the y values
14:36 - because the y values can be the same for different
parts of the graph, but the x values are always
14:40 - unique. Describe where this function is decreasing.
That's for x values between negative four
14:51 - and negative two, and between four and seven.
I can write this using inequalities as negative
14:58 - for less than x less than negative two, for
less than x less than seven. It's not important
15:06 - whether I use less than or less than or equal
to signs here, I'm going to use less than
15:11 - or equal to signs at the endpoints of the
functions domain where the function stops
15:18 - existing altogether. And I'll use strict less
than signs just where the function starts
15:24 - or stops decreasing in the middle of its domain.
But again, that's not important. Describe
15:30 - where the function is increasing. That's for
x values in between negative two, and one.
15:40 - So I can write that as an inequality as negative
two less than x less than one, I can also
15:48 - describe these intervals in interval notation.
So that would be close bracket, negative four,
15:54 - negative to open bracket, a cup sign for union,
and then four comma seven, for the decreasing
16:01 - part, and the increasing part is negative
two, comma one, I'm going to modify my graph
16:08 - just a little bit. Now by putting arrows on
the end, what I have arrows instead of dots
16:13 - are just hard stops, that signifies that the
function continues in the same direction forever.
16:20 - So if I write it like that, then the place
where the function is increasing is still
16:25 - the same, it's still going to be from x values
going from negative two to one. But now the
16:33 - decreasing part of the function extends further.
So this section, these x values extend all
16:40 - the way out to infinity in it, we assume that
it keeps going keeps decreasing here. So I
16:45 - would write that as for infinity, and similar
the the left part, I would write as negative
16:55 - infinity, negative two, because the function
is going on forever in this direction to set
17:00 - x values go all the way to negative infinity
on that chunk. So when talking about increasing
17:06 - and decreasing parts of functions based on
graphs, the thing to remember is that x is
17:13 - going to be heading from left to right. As
long as you do that, increasing just means
17:20 - that y goes up. Decreasing means that y goes
down. And if you're after describing the intervals,
17:28 - you have to do that in terms of x values.
This video is about identifying maximums and
17:38 - minimums for functions from their graphs.
We'll start with some definitions. A function
17:46 - f of x has an absolute maximum at the x value
of x equals C, if the y value at x equals
17:53 - C is as big as it ever gets. We can write
this more precisely by saying that f of c,
18:03 - that's the y value at x equals C is bigger
than or equal to f of x, that's the y value
18:09 - at some other x value for all x values in
the domain of f, that biggest y value f a
18:22 - c is called the absolute maximum value for
F. And the point with an x value and a y value
18:32 - given is called an absolute maximum point.
If I have a graph of a function, then the
18:40 - absolute maximum value, f of c is the highest
value that function ever achieves. And the
18:48 - absolute maximum point is the point where
it achieves that value. Now it's possible
18:55 - for a function to have more than one absolute
maximum point, if there happens to be a tie
19:00 - where that highest value is achieved. But
a function can only have at most one absolute
19:07 - maximum value. function f of x has an absolute
minimum at x equals C. If the y value at x
19:20 - equals C is as small as it ever gets. We can
write this more precisely by saying that f
19:28 - of c is less than or equal to f of x for all
x values in the domain of f. the y value f
19:40 - of c is called the absolute minimum value
of f. And the point c f of c is called an
19:52 - absolute minimum point in the graph of f of
x. f of c is now The lowest y value that the
20:03 - graph ever achieves. And the point c f of
c is the point where it achieves this very
20:08 - low y value. For example, this function has
an absolute minimum value of about negative
20:17 - eight, and it has an absolute minimum point
with coordinates, three, negative eight. If
20:26 - this function stops here, and has domain from
x values just from zero to four, then the
20:33 - function will have an absolute maximum value
of 10, achieved at the point with coordinates
20:42 - for 10. If however, the function keeps going
on forever, then it will have no absolute
20:50 - maximum value at all. absolute maximum minimum
values can also be called global maximum and
20:59 - minimum values. A function f of x has a local
maximum at x equals C. If the y value at the
21:10 - x value of c is bigger than any y values nearby,
it doesn't have to be the biggest y value
21:17 - anywhere in the domain. For example, for this
function, there's bigger y values up here,
21:22 - it just has to be the biggest y value nearby,
or more precisely, in an open interval of
21:29 - X values around C. We can write this by saying
that f of c is bigger than or equal to f of
21:37 - x for all x values, and an open interval around
C, the y value f OC is called a local maximum
21:52 - value for F. And the point with coordinates
c f OC is called a local maximum point, a
22:00 - function f of x has a local minimum at x equals
C. If f of c is less than or equal to f of
22:10 - x, for all x values in an open interval around
the y value f of c is called a local minimum
22:21 - value. And the point with coordinate c f a
c is called a local minimum point. A function
22:32 - might have many local minimum values. In this
example, assuming that the domain is from
22:44 - zero to four, we have a local minimum point
at x equals three, because this point here
22:53 - is the lowest point anywhere nearby. It also
happens to be an absolute minimum point. Turning
23:01 - our attention to local maximum points. This
function has a local maximum point at one
23:07 - to say, because this point here is the highest
point anywhere nearby, even though it's not
23:14 - the highest point anywhere in the domain since
their highest points higher points over here.
23:19 - So we have a local max point at one two, which
is not an absolute max. different sources
23:30 - use different conventions as far as whether
the point 410 up here counts as a local maximum
23:36 - point or not. Some sources do consider it
a local maximum, since it's the highest point
23:41 - anywhere nearby. But other sources say that
it doesn't count as a local maximum, for the
23:46 - technical reason that you can't get an open
interval values around four because the function
23:53 - is not defined in an open interval around
four because it's domain stops at four. So
23:58 - I'll just write this as a caution that some
sources do not consider for 10 to be a local
24:13 - max point, because f is not defined. In an
open interval around x equals four, local
24:29 - maximum and minimum values can also be called
relative maximum and minimum values. Please
24:39 - pause the video for a moment to mark all local
maximum minimum points on the graph of this
24:45 - function, as well as all absolute max and
min points. The function has a local max point
24:52 - here at the point with coordinates approximately
say 2.7 3.3 It's a local max point because
25:02 - it's the highest point anywhere nearby. There's
a local min point right here at the point
25:09 - with coordinates to to, since this is the
lowest point anywhere nearby. If this point
25:15 - actually existed, it would also be a local
main points as well as an absolute min point.
25:21 - But this drilled out circle means that point
is not actually part of the graph. So there's
25:26 - no local min point here, and no absolute min
points. The point here with coordinates 04,
25:34 - is considered by some sources to be a local
max point, but by other sources is not considered
25:39 - a local max point. Since the function is not
defined in an open interval around zero, turning
25:45 - our attention to absolute maximum and points
while there's no absolute max points as the
25:50 - function keeps going up and up and up forever.
There's also no absolute min points, because
25:59 - the function just keeps going down and down
a little by little and never actually achieves
26:04 - a lowest value. Now if we're talking about
local maximum values, that's just the y values
26:11 - of the local maxima endpoints. So there's
a local max value at this y value of 3.3.
26:17 - And there's a local min value of two this
points y value. There are no absolute max
26:24 - or min values for this function. In this video,
we defined absolute and local, max and min
26:36 - points and values. This video is about symmetry
of graphs and functions. We say that a graph
26:44 - is symmetric with respect to the x axis, if
the graph has mirror symmetry, with the x
26:54 - axis as the mirror line. This graph here is
an example. Here is the mirror line. Notice
27:04 - that the point five three is on this graph.
And so it's mirror image, five, negative three
27:13 - is also on the graph. Similarly, the point
two, two is on the graph and its mirror image,
27:20 - two, negative two is on the graph. For any
point x, y on a graph, its mirror image when
27:28 - you flip over the x axis will have coordinates
the same x coordinate and the opposite of
27:36 - the y coordinates. Therefore, we can say that
a graph is symmetric with respect to the x
27:41 - axis. If whenever a point x, y is on the graph,
the point x negative y is also on the graph.
27:50 - We say that a graph is symmetric with respect
to the y axis, if it has mirror symmetry,
27:59 - with the y axis as the mirror line. This graph
is symmetric with respect to the y axis, here
28:07 - is the mirror line. Notice that the point
with coordinates two three is on this graph.
28:16 - Its mirror image, which is also on the graph
has coordinates negative two, three, so the
28:22 - same y coordinate, but the opposite x coordinate.
And in fact, if I take any point with coordinates
28:30 - x, y, and I want its mirror image with the
y axis as a mirror line, I'm going to get
28:37 - the point with the same height the same y
coordinate, but the opposite x coordinate.
28:46 - So I can say that a graph is symmetric with
respect to the y axis. If whenever a point
28:50 - x, y is on the graph, the point negative x,
y is also on the graph. Finally, a graph is
28:58 - symmetric with respect to the origin if it
has 180 degree rotational symmetry around
29:10 - the origin. This means that if I spin it by
180 degrees, the graph should line up exactly
29:20 - with itself. Rotating a graph by 180 degrees
is the same thing as turning it upside down.
29:26 - So one way to see if a graph has symmetry
respect to the origin, is to turn it upside
29:31 - down and see if it looks exactly the same.
This one does. playing around with points,
29:38 - I noticed that the point one, negative two
is on this graph. If I rotate that point around
29:46 - the origin by 180 degrees, I get to the point
with coordinates negative one, two. If I start
29:56 - with a point on the graph with coordinates,
two, three, And I rotate by 180 degrees, I
30:02 - get the point with coordinates negative two,
negative three. And in general, if I start
30:10 - with a point x, y, and I rotate that 180 degrees
around the origin, I get the point with coordinates
30:19 - negative x, negative y. so we can say that
a graph is symmetric with respect to the origin.
30:25 - If whenever a point x, y is on the graph,
the point negative x negative y is also on
30:31 - the graph. Please pause the video for a moment
and decide which of these graphs are symmetric
30:36 - with respect to the x axis, the y axis and
the origin. Some graphs may have more than
30:42 - one type of symmetry. Graph a is symmetric
with respect to the origin. Because if you
30:49 - rotate it by 180 degrees, that is you turn
it upside down, it looks exactly the same.
30:54 - It does not have any mirror symmetry, so it's
not symmetric with respect to the x axis or
30:58 - the y axis. Graph B does have mirror symmetry,
I'll draw on the two mirror lines. So it's
31:06 - both symmetric with respect to the x axis
and symmetric with respect to the y axis.
31:13 - It also looks exactly the same upside down.
So it's also symmetric with respect to the
31:17 - origin. Graph C is symmetric with respect
to the y axis, but has no other symmetry.
31:25 - And graph D is symmetric with respect to the
x axis with no other symmetry. We use the
31:33 - words even and odd to describe functions whose
graphs have certain kinds of symmetry. A function
31:41 - is even if its graph is symmetric, with respect
to the y axis. Remember that being symmetric
31:50 - with respect to the y axis means that whenever
a point x, y is on the graph, its mirror image,
31:58 - negative x, y is also on the graph. That is,
the y values corresponding to x and negative
32:07 - x are the same. Using function notation, I
can write these points as the points with
32:15 - coordinates x, f of x and negative x, f of
negative X, since the y value for a function
32:24 - is given by f of its x value. So we can say
that a function f of x is even if F of negative
32:33 - X equals f of x, for all x values in its domain,
the function has the same height at x and
32:41 - negative x. For example, we can see the function
f of x equals x squared plus three is even.
32:49 - And one way to see this is by looking at its
graph, which looks pretty much like the graph
32:52 - I've drawn. And that is saying that this graph
is symmetric across the y axis. But we can
33:00 - also check that this function is even algebraically.
without knowing anything about this graph,
33:04 - all we have to do is check that F of negative
X is equal to f of x. So if we plug in at
33:12 - negative x for x into this formula, that's
negative x squared plus three, but negative
33:19 - x squared is the same thing as x squared.
And so this is exactly the same thing as f
33:25 - of x. And the property of being even is satisfied.
We say that a function f of x is odd, if its
33:35 - graph is symmetric with respect to the origin.
Recall that a graph is symmetric with respect
33:42 - to the origin means that whenever a point
x, y is on the graph, it's 180 80 degree rotated
33:51 - point, negative x, negative y is also on the
graph. That is the graph y value at x. And
34:00 - the graphs y value at negative x are the opposites
of each other, same magnitude but opposite
34:07 - sign. If we use function notation, for the
coordinates of these points, this one is x,
34:13 - f of x, and this one is negative x, f of negative
x, right because the y value for a function
34:23 - at the x value of negative x is just F of
negative X. So for a function to be odd, we
34:29 - see that F of negative X, that y value has
to be the opposite of f of x, the other guys
34:38 - y value. A function f of x is odd if F of
negative X is the negative of f of x for all
34:48 - x in its domain. Let's look at this example.
We could draw its graph and verify the functions
34:56 - odd by seeing that rotational symmetry around
the order On this graph, but we can also figure
35:01 - it out algebraically by checking to see if
F of negative X is equal to negative of f
35:08 - of x. So let's plug in negative x for x in
the formula for F, that gives us five times
35:14 - negative x minus one over negative x, that
simplifies to negative 5x plus one over x.
35:22 - And we can see that that is actually the negative
5x minus one over x by factoring out a negative
35:30 - sign, which is negative f of x. So the property
for being odd holds. In this video, we talked
35:41 - about symmetry with respect to the x axis
symmetry with respect to the y axis, and symmetry
35:49 - with respect to the origin. functions that
are symmetric with respect to the y axis are
35:55 - even functions and functions that are symmetric
with respect to the origin, or odd functions.
36:01 - There's no word for functions that are symmetric
with respect to the x axis. And that's because
36:05 - if your graph is symmetric with respect to
the x axis, it's not going to be a function.
36:11 - This video gives the graphs of some commonly
used functions that I call the toolkit functions.
36:17 - The first function is the function y equals
x, let's plot a few points on the graph of
36:23 - this function. If x is zero, y zero, if x
is one, y is one, and so on y is always equal
36:32 - to x doesn't have to just be an integer, it
can be any real number, and we'll connecting
36:38 - the dots we get a straight line through the
origin. Let's look at the graph of y equals
36:44 - x squared. If x is zero, y is zero. So we'll
go through the origin again. If x is one,
36:51 - y is one, and x is negative one, y is also
one, the x value of two gives a y value of
37:01 - four and the x value of negative two gives
a y value of four also connecting the dots,
37:07 - we get a parabola. That is this, this function
is an even function. That means it has mirror
37:17 - symmetry across the y axis, the left side
it looks like exactly like the mirror image
37:22 - of the right side. That happens because when
you square a positive number, like two, you
37:28 - get the exact same y value as when you square
it's a mirror image x value of negative two.
37:36 - The next function y equals x cubed. I'll call
that a cubic. Let's plot a few points when
37:42 - x is zero, y is zero. When x is one, y is
one, when x is negative one, y is negative
37:50 - one, two goes with the point eight way up
here, and an x value of negative two is going
37:56 - to give us negative eight. If I connect the
dots, I get something that looks kind of like
38:01 - this. This function is what's called an odd
function, because it has 180 degree rotational
38:11 - symmetry occur around the origin. If I rotate
this whole graph by 180 degrees, or in other
38:16 - words, turn the paper upside down, I'll get
exactly the same shape. The reason this function
38:23 - has this odd symmetry is because when I cube
a positive number, and get its y value, I
38:30 - get n cube the corresponding negative number
to get its y value, the negative number cubed
38:36 - gives us exactly the negative of the the y
value we get with cubing the positive number.
38:43 - Let's look at the next example. Y equals the
square root of x. Notice that the domain of
38:50 - this function is just x values bigger than
or equal to zero because we can't take the
38:56 - square root of a negative number. Let's plug
in a few x values. X is zero gives y is 0x
39:03 - is one square root of one is one, square root
of four is two, and connecting the dots, I
39:10 - get a function that looks like this. The absolute
value function is next. Again, if we plug
39:17 - in a few points, x is zero goes with y equals
0x plus one gives us one, the absolute value
39:25 - of negative one is one to two is on the graph
and the absolute value of negative two is
39:32 - to I'm ending up getting a V shaped graph.
It also has even or a mirror symmetry. Y equals
39:43 - two to the x is what's known as an exponential
function. That's because the variable x is
39:49 - in the exponent. If I plot a few points, two
to the zero is one Two to the one is to two
40:02 - squared is four, two to the minus one is one
half. I'll plot these on my graph. Let me
40:10 - fill in a few more points. So let's see, two
cubed is eight, that's way up here. And negative
40:17 - two gives me 1/4 1/8. Connecting the Dots,
I get something that's shaped like this. You
40:26 - might have heard the expression exponential
growth, when talking about, for example, population
40:30 - growth, this is function is represents exponential
growth, it grows very, very steeply. Every
40:37 - time we increase the x coordinate by one we
double the y coordinate. We could also look
40:46 - at a function like y equals three dx, or sometimes
y equals e to the x, where E is just a number
40:53 - about 2.7. These functions look very similar.
It's just the bigger base makes us rise a
41:01 - little more steeply. Now let's look at the
function y equals one over x. It's not defined
41:08 - when x is zero, but I can plug in x equals
one half whenever one half is two. Whenever
41:17 - one is one, and one over two is one half,
by connect the dots, I get this shape in the
41:25 - first quadrant, but I haven't looked at negative
values of x, when x is negative, whenever
41:30 - negative one is negative one, whenever negative
half is negative two, and I get a similar
41:37 - looking piece in the third quadrant. This
is an example of a hyperbola. And it's also
41:47 - an odd function, because it has that 180 degree
rotational symmetry, if I turn the page upside
41:54 - down, it'll look exactly the same. Finally,
let's look at y equals one over x squared.
42:00 - Again, it's not defined when x is zero, but
I can plug in points like one half or X, let's
42:08 - see one over one half squared is one over
1/4, which is four. And one over one squared,
42:17 - one over two squared is a fourth, it looks
pretty much like the previous function is
42:23 - just a little bit more extreme rises a little
more steeply, falls a little more dramatically.
42:28 - But for negative values of x, something a
little bit different goes on. For example,
42:33 - one over negative two squared is just one
over four, which is a fourth. So I can plot
42:39 - that point there, and one over negative one
squared, that's just one. So my curve for
42:47 - negative values of x is gonna lie in the second
quadrant, not the third quadrant. This is
42:52 - an example of an even function because it
has perfect mirror symmetry across the y axis.
43:01 - These are the toolkit functions, and I recommend
you memorize the shape of each of them. That
43:08 - way, you can draw at least a rough sketch
very quickly without having to plug in points.
43:14 - That's all for the graphs of the toolkit functions.
If we change the equation of a function, then
43:22 - the graph of the function changes or transforms
in predictable ways. This video gives some
43:29 - rules and examples for transformations of
functions. To get the most out of this video,
43:33 - it's helpful if you're already familiar with
the graph of some typical functions, I call
43:38 - them toolkit functions, like y equals square
root of x, y equals x squared, y equals the
43:44 - absolute value of x and so on. If you're not
familiar with those graphs, I encourage you
43:49 - to watch my video called toolkit functions
first, before watching this one. I want to
43:55 - start by reviewing function notation. If g
of x represents the function, the square root
44:02 - of x, then we can rewrite these expressions
in terms of square roots. For example, g of
44:08 - x minus two is the same thing as the square
root of x minus two. g of quantity x minus
44:17 - two means we plug in x minus two everywhere
we see an x, so that would be the same thing
44:25 - as the square root of quantity x minus two.
In this second example, I say that we're subtracting
44:33 - two on the inside of the function, because
we're subtracting two before we apply the
44:38 - square root function. Whereas on the first
example, I say that the minus two is on the
44:43 - outside of the function. We're doing the square
root function first and then subtracting two.
44:48 - In this third example, g of 3x. We're multiplying
by three on the inside of the function. To
44:54 - evaluate this in terms of square root, we
plug in the entire 3x for x, and this square
45:00 - root function, that gives us the square root
of 3x. In the next example, we're multiplying
45:07 - by three on the outside of the function, this
is just three times the square root of x.
45:12 - Finally, g of minus x means the square root
of minus x. This might look a little odd,
45:20 - because we're not used to taking the square
root of a negative number. But remember that
45:24 - if x itself is negative, like negative to
the negative x will be negative negative two
45:29 - or positive two. So we're really be taking
the square root of a positive number in that
45:33 - case, let me record which of these are inside
and which of these are outside of my function.
45:40 - In this next set of examples, we're using
the same function g of x squared of x. But
45:45 - this time, we're starting with an expression
with square roots in it, and trying to write
45:48 - it in terms of g of x. So the first example,
the plus 17 is on the outside of my function,
45:56 - because I'm taking the square root of x first,
and then adding 17. So I can write this as
46:02 - g of x plus 17. In the second example, I'm
taking x and adding 12 first, then I take
46:11 - the square root of the whole thing. Since
I'm adding the 12 to x first that's on the
46:15 - inside of my function. So I write that as
g of the quantity x plus 12. Remember that
46:22 - this notation means I plug in the entire x
plus 12, into the square root sign, which
46:28 - gives me exactly square root of x plus 12.
And this next example of doing the square
46:33 - root first and then multiplying by negative
36, so i minus 36 multiplications, outside
46:39 - my function, I can rewrite this as minus 36
times g of x. Finally, in this last example,
46:47 - I take x multiplied by a fourth and then apply
the square root of x. So that's the same thing
46:52 - as g of 1/4 x by 1/4. x is on the inside of
my function. In other words, it's inside the
47:00 - parentheses when I use function notation.
Let's graph the square root of x and two transformations
47:07 - of this function, y equals the square root
of x goes to the point 0011. And for two,
47:13 - since the square root of four is two, it looks
something like this. In order to graph y equals
47:21 - the square root of x minus two, notice that
the minus two is on the outside of the function,
47:27 - that means we're going to take the square
root of x first and then subtract two. So
47:32 - for example, if we start with the x value
of zero, and compute the square root of zero,
47:36 - that's zero, then we subtract two to give
us a y value of negative two, an x value of
47:42 - one, which under the square root function
had a y value of one now has a y value that's
47:49 - decreased by two, one minus two is negative
one. And finally, an x value of four, which
47:56 - under the square root function had a y value
of two now has a y value of two minus two
48:02 - or zero, its y value is also decreased by
two. If I plot these new points, zero goes
48:09 - with negative two, one goes with negative
one, and four goes with zero, I have my transformed
48:16 - graph. Because I subtracted two on the outside
of my function, my y values were decreased
48:23 - by two, which brought my graph down by two
units. Next, let's look at y equals the square
48:30 - root of quantity x minus two. Now we're subtracting
two on the inside of our function, which means
48:36 - we subtract two from x first and then take
the square root. In order to get the same
48:40 - y value of zero as we had in our blue graph,
we need our x minus two to be zero, so we
48:46 - need our original x to be two. In order to
get the y value of one that we had in our
48:52 - blue graph, we need to be taking the square
root of one, so we need x minus two to be
48:58 - one, which means that we need to start with
an x value of three. And in order to reproduce
49:04 - our y value of two from our original graph,
we need the square root of x minus two to
49:10 - be two, which means we need to start out by
taking the square root of four, which means
49:16 - our x minus two is four, so our x should be
up there at six. If I plot my x values, with
49:25 - my corresponding y values of square root of
x minus two, I get the following graph. Notice
49:31 - that the graph has moved horizontally to the
right by two units. To me, moving down by
49:39 - two units, makes sense because we're subtracting
two, so we're decreasing y's by two units,
49:45 - but the minus two on the inside that kind
of does the opposite of what I expect, I might
49:50 - expect it to to move the graph left I might
expect the x values to be going down by two
49:55 - units, but instead, it moves the graph to
the right because As the x units have to go
50:01 - up by two units, in order to get the right
square root, when I then subtract two units,
50:07 - again, the observations we made for these
transformations of functions hold in general,
50:12 - according to the following rules. First of
all numbers on the outside of the function,
50:18 - like in our example, y equals the square root
of x minus two, those numbers affect the y
50:24 - values, and result in vertical motions, like
we saw, these motions are in the direction
50:29 - you expect. So subtracting two was just down
by two. If we were adding two instead, that
50:35 - would move us up by two numbers on the inside
of the function. That's like our example,
50:42 - y equals the square root of quantity x minus
two, those affect the x values and results
50:47 - in a horizontal motion, these motions go in
the opposite direction from what you expect.
50:53 - Remember, the minus two on the inside actually
shifted our graph to the right, if it had
50:58 - had a plus two on the inside, that would actually
shift our graph to the left. Adding results
51:05 - in a shift those are called translations,
but multiplying like something like y equals
51:12 - three times a squared of x, that would result
in a stretch or shrink. In other words, if
51:19 - I start with the square root of x, and then
when I graph y equals three times the square
51:25 - root of x, that stretches my graph vertically
by a factor of three. Like this, if I want
51:33 - to graph y equals 1/3, times the square root
of x, that shrinks my graph vertically by
51:39 - a factor of 1/3. Finally, a negative sign
results in reflection. For example, if I start
51:47 - with a graph of y equals the square root of
x, and then want to graph y equals the square
51:52 - root of negative x, that's going to do a reflection
in the horizontal direction because the negative
51:58 - is on the inside of the square root sign.
A reflection in the horizontal direction means
52:04 - reflection across the y axis. If instead I
want to graph y equals negative A squared
52:10 - of x, that negative sign on the outside means
a vertical reflection, a reflection across
52:16 - the x axis. Pause the video for a moment and
see if you could describe what happens in
52:23 - these four transformations. In the first example,
we're subtracting four on the outside of the
52:30 - function. adding or subtracting means a translation
or shift. And since we're on the outside of
52:36 - the function affects the y value, so that's
moving us vertically. So this transformation
52:41 - should take the square root of graph and move
it down by four units, that would look something
52:48 - like this. In the next example, we're adding
12 on the inside, that's still a translation.
52:57 - But now we're moving horizontally. And so
since we go the opposite direction, we expect
53:02 - we are going to go to the left by 12 units,
that's going to look something like this.
53:09 - And the next example, we're multiplying by
three and introducing a negative sign both
53:13 - on the outside of our function outside our
function means we're affecting the y values.
53:19 - So and multiplication means we're stretching
by a factor of three, the negative sign means
53:24 - we reflect in the vertical direction, here's
stretching by a factor of three vertically,
53:31 - before I apply the minus sign, and now the
minus sign reflects in the vertical direction.
53:37 - Finally, in this last example, we're multiplying
by one quarter on the inside of our function,
53:44 - we know that multiplication means stretch
or shrink. And since we're on the inside,
53:49 - it's a horizontal motion, and it does the
opposite of what we expect. So instead of
53:54 - shrinking by a factor of 1/4, horizontally,
it's actually going to stretch by the reciprocal,
54:00 - a factor of four horizontally. that'll look
something like this. Notice that stretching
54:07 - horizontally by a factor of four looks kind
of like shrinking vertically by a factor of
54:12 - one half. And that's actually borne out by
the algebra, because the square root of 1/4
54:18 - x is the same thing as the square root of
1/4 times the square root of x, which is the
54:23 - same thing as one half times the square root
of x. And so now we can see algebraically
54:29 - that vertical shrink by a factor of one half
is the same as a horizontal stretch by a factor
54:35 - of four, at least for this function, the square
root function. This video gives some rules
54:42 - for transformations of functions, which I'll
repeat below. numbers on the outside correspond
54:49 - to changes in the y values or vertical motions.
numbers on the inside of the function, affect
54:58 - the x values and raise out in horizontal motions,
adding and subtracting corresponds to translations
55:07 - or shifts. multiplying and dividing by numbers
corresponds to stretches and shrinks. And
55:16 - putting in a negative sign. correspond corresponds
to a reflection, horizontal reflection if
55:25 - the negative sign is on the inside, and a
vertical reflection if the negative sign is
55:29 - on the outside. Knowing these basic rules
about transformations empowers you to be able
55:35 - to sketch graphs of much more complicated
functions, like y equals three times the square
55:41 - root of x plus two, by simply considering
the transformations, one at a time. This video
55:48 - introduces piecewise functions. A piecewise
function is a function whose defined in pieces
55:55 - by two or more different rules that apply
for different x values. The rule for calculating
56:02 - this function is you calculate negative x
squared if x is less than one, but you calculate
56:08 - negative 2x plus three if x is greater than
or equal to one. So if we want to find f of
56:14 - negative two, well, negative two is less than
one. So the first rule applies. And we compute
56:22 - f of negative two by plugging in negative
two for x in the first rule, so that's negative
56:28 - four. Next, we want to find f of one. Well,
one is right on the border in between the
56:36 - two rules. But because we have a greater than
or equal to here, when x is equal to one,
56:42 - we apply this rule. And so we could plug one
into the formula, negative 2x plus three sets
56:49 - negative two times one plus three, which gives
us one as our output. Finally, if we want
56:54 - to compute f of three, since three is bigger
than or equal to one, the second rule applies.
57:00 - And we plug three into that role. That gives
us an answer of negative three. To graph F,
57:09 - it makes sense to also draw the graph in pieces.
First, I'm going to draw the graph of minus
57:14 - x squared, just x squared would be a problem
opening up, so minus x squared is a parabola
57:21 - opening down goes through the points negative
one, negative one and one negative one. So
57:30 - it looks something like this. Now I've drawn
the whole parabola, but the rule actually
57:37 - only applies when x is less than one. So I'll
keep the part of the parabola when x is less
57:42 - than one. And I'll erase the part of the parabola
when x is greater than or equal to one. I'll
57:49 - leave an open circle here, when x equals one
since that point is not included in this definition,
57:55 - either. Next, I'm going to draw the second
piece, the line y equals minus 2x plus three.
58:02 - So that's a line with slope negative two,
and intercept y intercept three, so it goes
58:07 - through this point 03. And then it goes over
by one and down by two. So it goes through
58:14 - the point one, one, over by one down by two.
And 
58:26 - I can continue and draw this straight line.
Again, we only want part of this graph the
58:28 - part where x is greater than or equal to one.
So I'll erase the part where x is less than
58:33 - one, this part here. This time, I'm going
to leave a closed circle, where x is equal
58:39 - to one, since that point is included on that
graph. When drawing this graph, it's good
58:44 - to think about what happens when x equals
one the border point, both in the second role,
58:51 - where we actually include that point. And
in the first rule, where we don't actually
58:55 - include that point, but we kind of have to
draw it in order anyway to draw the open circle
58:59 - here. Now the last question asks us if this
function is continuous. The informal definition
59:06 - of continuity that I'm going to use is that
a function is continuous if you can draw the
59:09 - whole thing without picking up your pencil.
And this case, we can't, because we have to
59:15 - pick up our pencil to get from the jump here,
up to here. So this function is not continuous,
59:21 - it's got a discontinuity when x is one, which
is exactly the border port between the two
59:26 - rules. Often piecewise functions will have
discontinuities, where they transition from
59:32 - one role to the next. However, it's possible
to have a piecewise defined function that
59:37 - has no discontinuity if the two pieces happen
to line up perfectly. For example, if we've
59:43 - changed the functions definition slightly,
I'll call it g of x this time to still be
59:48 - the negative x squared when x is less than
one, but this time, negative 2x plus one,
59:54 - if x is bigger than equal to one, then when
we graph it, The parabola piece will look
60:01 - the same, but the linear piece will be two
units lower than before. And so it'll actually
60:08 - start right here at one, negative one and
go down, and our function will be continuous.
60:16 - That's all for this introduction to piecewise
functions. The inverse of a function undoes
60:22 - what the function does. So the inverse of
tying your shoes would be to untie them. And
60:29 - the inverse of the function that adds two
to a number would be the function that subtracts
60:36 - two from a number. This video introduces inverses
and their properties. Suppose f of x is a
60:44 - function defined by this chart. In other words,
f of two is three, f of three is five, f of
60:50 - four is six, and f of five is one, the inverse
function for F written f superscript. Negative
60:59 - 1x undoes what f does. Since f takes two to
three, F inverse takes three back to two.
61:10 - So we write this f superscript. Negative one
of three is to. Similarly, since f takes three
61:19 - to five, F inverse takes five to three. And
since f takes four to six, f inverse of six
61:28 - is four. And since f takes five to one, f
inverse of one is five. I'll use these numbers
61:37 - to fill in the chart. Notice that the chart
of values when y equals f of x and the chart
61:44 - of values, when y equals f inverse of x are
closely related. They share the same numbers,
61:50 - but the x values for f of x correspond to
the y values for f inverse of x, and the y
61:57 - values for f of x correspond to the x values
for f inverse of x. That leads us to the first
62:04 - key fact inverse functions reverse the roles
of y and x. I'm going to plot the points for
62:11 - y equals f of x in blue. Next, I'll plot the
points for y equals f inverse of x in red.
62:20 - Pause the video for a moment and see what
kind of symmetry you observe in this graph.
62:24 - How are the blue points related to the red
points, you might have noticed that the blue
62:29 - points and the red points are mirror images
over the mirror line, y equals x. So our second
62:38 - key fact is that the graph of y equals f inverse
of x can be obtained from the graph of y equals
62:44 - f of x by reflecting over the line y equals
x. This makes sense, because inverses, reverse
62:53 - the roles of y and x. In the same example,
let's compute f inverse of f of two, this
63:01 - open circle means composition. In other words,
we're computing f inverse of f of two, we
63:10 - compute this from the inside out. So that's
f inverse of three. Since F of two is three,
63:19 - and f inverse of three, we see as to similarly,
we can compute f of f inverse of three. And
63:31 - that means we take f of f inverse of three.
Since f inverse of three is two, that's the
63:38 - same thing as computing F of two, which is
three. Please pause the video for a moment
63:47 - and compute these other compositions. You
should have found that in every case, if you
63:56 - take f inverse of f of a number, you get back
to the very same number you started with.
64:02 - And similarly, if you take f of f inverse
of any number, you get back to the same number
64:07 - you started with. So in general, f inverse
of f of x is equal to x, and f of f inverse
64:15 - of x is also equal to x. This is the mathematical
way of saying that F and envir f inverse undo
64:22 - each other. Let's look at a different example.
Suppose that f of x is x cubed. Pause the
64:29 - video for a moment and guess what the inverse
of f should be. Remember, F inverse undoes
64:35 - the work that F does. You might have guessed
that f inverse of x is going to be the cube
64:43 - root function. We can check that this is true
by looking at f of f inverse of x, that's
64:51 - F of the cube root of function, which means
the cube root function cubed, which gets us
64:57 - back to x. Similarly, If we compute f inverse
of f of x, that's the cube root of x cubed.
65:06 - And we get back to excellence again. So the
cube root function really is the inverse of
65:12 - the cubing function. When we compose the two
functions, we get back to the number that
65:17 - we started with. It'd be nice to have a more
systematic way of finding inverses of functions
65:24 - besides guessing and checking. One method
uses the fact that inverses, reverse the roles
65:31 - of y and x. So if we want to find the inverse
of the function, f of x equals five minus
65:37 - x over 3x, we can write it as y equals five
minus x over 3x. Reverse the roles of y and
65:46 - x to get x equals five minus y over three
y, and then solve for y. To solve for y, let's
65:57 - multiply both sides by three y. Bring all
terms with y's in to the left side, and alternate
66:06 - without y's and then to the right side, factor
out the y and divide to isolate y. This gives
66:19 - us f inverse of x as five over 3x plus one.
Notice that our original function f and our
66:28 - inverse function, f inverse are both rational
functions, but they're not the reciprocals
66:33 - of each other. And then General, f inverse
of x is not usually equal to one over f of
66:40 - x. This can be confusing, because when we
write two to the minus one, that does mean
66:48 - one or two, but f to the minus one of x means
the inverse function and not the reciprocal.
66:56 - It's natural to ask if all functions have
inverse functions, that is for any function
67:02 - you might encounter. Is there always a function
that it's it is its inverse? In fact, the
67:09 - answer is no. See, if you can come up with
an example of a function that does not have
67:16 - an inverse function. The word function here
is key. Remember that a function is a relationship
67:24 - between x values and y values, such that for
each x value in the domain, there's only one
67:33 - corresponding y value. One example of a function
that does not have an inverse function is
67:42 - the function f of x equals x squared. To see
that, the inverse of this function is not
67:51 - a function. Note that for the x squared function,
the number two and the number negative two,
68:00 - both go to number four. So if I had an inverse,
it would have to send four to both two and
68:08 - negative two, the inverse would not be a function,
it might be easier to understand the problem,
68:16 - when you look at a graph of y equals x squared.
Recall that inverse functions reverse the
68:24 - roles of y and x and flip the graph over the
line y equals x. But when I flip the green
68:31 - graph over the line y equals x, I get this
red graph. This red graph is not the graph
68:37 - of a function, because it violates the vertical
line test. The reason that violates the vertical
68:43 - line test is because the original green function
violates the horizontal line test, and has
68:51 - 2x values with the same y value. In general,
a function f has an inverse function if and
68:59 - only if the graph of f satisfies the horizontal
line test, ie every horizontal line intersects
69:04 - the graph. And at most one point, pause the
video for a moment and see which of these
69:10 - four graphs satisfy the horizontal line test.
In other words, which of the four corresponding
69:16 - functions would have an inverse function you
may have found that graphs A and B violate
69:25 - the horizontal line test. So their functions
would not have inverse functions. But graphs
69:31 - C and D satisfy the horizontal line test.
So these graphs represent functions that do
69:38 - have inverses. functions that satisfy the
horizontal line test are sometimes called
69:44 - One to One functions. Equivalently a function
is one to one if for any two different x values,
69:54 - x one and x two. the y value is f of x one
and f of x two are done. different numbers.
70:01 - Sometimes as I said, f is one to one, if,
whenever f of x one is equal to f of x two,
70:10 - then x one has to equal x two. As our last
example, let's try to find P inverse of x,
70:17 - where p of x as the square root of x minus
two drawn here, if we graph P inverse on the
70:24 - same axis as p of x, we get the following
graph, simply by flipping over the line y
70:31 - equals x. If we try to solve the problem,
algebraically, we can write y equal to a squared
70:38 - of x minus two, reverse the roles of y and
x and solve for y by squaring both sides and
70:47 - adding two. Now if we were to graph y equals
x squared plus two, that would look like a
70:55 - parabola, it would look like the red graph
we've already drawn together with another
71:03 - arm on the left side. But we know that our
actual inverse function consists only of this
71:10 - right arm, we can specify this algebraically
by making the restriction that x has to be
71:20 - bigger than or equal to zero. This corresponds
to the fact that on the original graph, for
71:28 - the square root of x, y was only greater than
or equal to zero. Looking more closely at
71:35 - the domain and range of P and P inverse, we
know that the domain of P is all values of
71:44 - x such that x minus two is greater than or
equal to zero. Since we can't take the square
71:48 - root of a negative number. This corresponds
to x values being greater than or equal to
71:54 - two, or an interval notation, the interval
from two to infinity. The range of P, we can
72:02 - see from the graph is our y value is greater
than or equal to zero, or the interval from
72:07 - zero to infinity. Similarly, based on the
graph, we see the domain of P inverse is x
72:16 - values greater than or equal to zero, the
interval from zero to infinity. And the range
72:21 - of P inverse is Y values greater than or equal
to two, or the interval from two to infinity.
72:29 - If you look closely at these domains and ranges,
you'll notice that the domain of P corresponds
72:35 - exactly to the range of P inverse, and the
range of P corresponds to the domain of P
72:41 - inverse. This makes sense, because inverse
functions reverse the roles of y and x. The
72:50 - domain of f inverse of x is the x values for
F inverse, which corresponds to the y values,
72:56 - or the range of F. The range of f inverse
is the y values for F inverse, which correspond
73:04 - to the x values or the domain of f. In this
video, we discussed five key properties of
73:12 - inverse functions. inverse functions, reverse
the roles of y and x. The graph of y equals
73:22 - f inverse of x is the graph of y equals f
of x reflected over the line y equals x. When
73:33 - we compose F with F inverse, we get the identity
function y equals x. And similarly, when we
73:42 - compose f inverse with F, that brings x to
x. In other words, F and F inverse undo each
73:48 - other. The function f of x has an inverse
function if and only if the graph of y equals
74:01 - f of x satisfies the horizontal line test.
And finally, the domain of f is the range
74:15 - of f inverse and the range of f is the domain
of f inverse. These properties of inverse
74:24 - functions will be important when we study
exponential functions and their inverses logarithmic
74:31 - functions. There are different ways of describing
the size of an angle. This video explains
74:39 - how to convert between them. angles are commonly
measured using either degrees or radians.
74:49 - If we're talking about degrees, then a full
circle, by convention is 360 degrees. A half
74:58 - circle then would be 180 degrees. And if I
wanted to do say, a third of a circle, that
75:06 - would be a third of 360 degrees or 120 degrees.
If we're using radians instead, then going
75:14 - all the way around the circle is called two
pi radians. The two pi was chosen because
75:23 - that's the circumference of a circle with
a radius of one, a half circle is then half
75:31 - of two pi radians, which is pi radians. And
if I wanted to do say, a quarter of a circle,
75:39 - that would be a quarter of my two pi radians,
a quarter of two pi is pi over two. To convert
75:50 - between degrees and radians is handed to us
the fact that 180 degrees corresponds to pi
75:57 - radians. Both of these represent half of a
circle. Let's convert negative 135 degrees
76:06 - to radians. Now, you might be wondering, what
does a negative angle even mean? Well, by
76:12 - convention, if we go in the counterclockwise
direction, that's considered a positive angle.
76:21 - And if we go in the clockwise direction, that's
considered a negative angle. To convert negative
76:30 - 135 degrees to radians, I could multiply by
pi radians per 180 degrees. Notice that the
76:40 - degrees cancel here, and I end up with negative
135 pi over 180 radians. That simplifies to
76:53 - negative three Pi over four radians. Or if
I convert pi to a decimal, that's negative
77:01 - 2.3562 radians, up to four decimal places.
But usually, if the answer is a simple fraction
77:12 - times pi, it's better to leave it in that
form. Rather than convert it to a decimal.
77:17 - I can also go the other direction and convert
radians to degrees, five pi over four radians.
77:27 - Now again, I we need to use the fact that
pi radians is 180 degrees. But if I write
77:31 - it like this, with radians on the top and
degrees on the bottom, then the radians won't
77:37 - cancel. So that doesn't work. Instead, so
instead, I need to find by the 180 degrees
77:44 - over hi radians, so they got cancel the radians
that way left radio cancel, and I get five
77:52 - pi times 180 over four pi degrees. Now the
PI's also cancel, and this simplifies to 225
78:02 - degrees. Converting seven radians to degrees
is similar, I need to multiply by 180 degrees
78:10 - over pi radians. If I work out seven times
180 over pi on my calculator, I get 401 point
78:19 - O seven degrees up to two decimal places.
Notice that my answer a little more than 400
78:26 - is more than 360 degrees, so this is more
than a full circle. That makes sense since
78:32 - seven radians is more than two pi radians.
Since pi is itself a little more than three.
78:40 - Sometimes angles are given in terms of degrees,
minutes and seconds, as in 32 degrees, 17
78:50 - minutes, and 25 seconds. A minute is defined
as 1/60 of a degree. A second is defined as
79:01 - 1/60 of a minute, but since a minute is itself
1/60 of a degree This is 1/60 of 1/60 of a
79:11 - degree, or one over 3600 of a degree. You
can also think of this by saying that they're
79:19 - 60 minutes in one degree and they're 3600
seconds in one degree. Let's convert this
79:34 - number of degrees minutes and seconds to a
decimal number of degrees. We know that we
79:40 - have 32 degrees plus 17 minutes plus 25 seconds.
I'm going to copy down the 32 degrees, but
79:52 - I need to convert the minutes to degrees.
I know that there's 60 minutes in one degree
80:00 - If I want the unit's to cancel, I better put
the degrees on the top, so one degree corresponds
80:05 - to 60 minutes. Similarly, if I want to convert
seconds to degrees 25 seconds, I know that
80:16 - there are 3600 seconds in one degree, I want
the degrees to end up on the top, and I want
80:22 - the seconds on the bottom to cancel with a
25 seconds. So I need to write it this way.
80:29 - Okay, now I can write this as 32 degrees plus
17 over 60 degrees plus 25 over 3600 degrees.
80:38 - And because the minutes cancelled, and the
seconds cancelled, if I add this all up on
80:46 - my calculator, I get 32.2903 degrees up to
four decimal places, I can also go the other
80:55 - direction, and convert a decimal number of
degrees into degrees, minutes and seconds.
81:02 - I'm starting out with 247 degrees plus a decimal
number of degrees leftover. If I want to convert
81:12 - 0.3486 degrees, two minutes, well, I know
that I have 60 minutes in one degree, this
81:22 - time, I want the minutes on the top and the
degrees on the bottom, so that my degrees
81:28 - will cancel. So I just multiply my decimal
by 60. And I end up with 20.916 minutes. Let
81:35 - me copy this down. And now I'm going to take
the 0.916 minutes and convert those two seconds.
81:49 - So I know that they're 60 seconds in one minute.
So canceling my units again, I just multiply
81:56 - by 60, which gives me 54.96 minutes, I can
copy this down as is. Or I can round off my
82:10 - seconds and get 247 degrees, 20 minutes, and
55 seconds. converting between different ways
82:20 - of measuring angles is all about unit conversion.
To convert between radians and degrees, we
82:26 - use the fact that pi radians corresponds to
180 degrees. To convert between minutes and
82:35 - seconds and degrees, we use the fact that
60 minutes corresponds to one degree, and
82:42 - 60 seconds corresponds to one minute. If you
have a circle, a piece of the circumference
82:51 - is called an arc. And a wedge of pi for that
circle is called a sector. This video explains
83:02 - how to calculate the length of the arc and
the area of the sector in terms of the angle
83:09 - and the radius of the circle. the circumference
of a circle is given by the formula, the circumference
83:18 - equals two pi times the radius. Let's use
that to solve the following problem. A circular
83:25 - pool has a radius of eight meters, find the
arc length spanned by a central angle of 2.5
83:34 - radians. So this angle from the center of
the circle is supposed to be 2.5 radians.
83:40 - I've drawn the angle is a little bit less
than half the circle because half the circle
83:45 - would be pi radians, which is 3.141 radians.
So I want to find the length of this arc.
83:54 - I know that the total circumference is going
to be two pi times eight meters. But I just
84:01 - want a fraction of the circumference. The
arc length I want is going to be given by
84:07 - the fraction of the circle that the angle
makes times the circumference of the circle.
84:17 - The fraction of the circle that I want is
given by the ratio of 2.5 radians over the
84:24 - total number of radians in the circle, which
is two pi radians. Multiply that by there's
84:30 - a conference, which we said was two pi times
eight meters. Notice that the two PI's cancel,
84:39 - and I'm left with just 2.5 times eight meters,
which is 10 meters. In general, the arc length
84:50 - is related to the angle it spans by considering
the arc length to be the fraction of the circle
84:57 - you get by taking the angle over The total
angle the circle of two pi times the circumference,
85:04 - which is two pi r. Since the two PI's cancel
as they did in our example, that means that
85:10 - arc length is given by theta times r. here,
R is the radius of the circle, and theta is
85:20 - the angle, it's important to note that theta
needs to be measured in radians, not degrees
85:27 - for this to work. That's because when I took
this ratio, I was using two pi radians for
85:34 - the total measure of the circle. So it's important
that theta also be in radians. The area of
85:40 - a circle is given by the formula, pi r squared,
where r is the radius, let's use that fact
85:48 - to find the area of the sector of a circle
of radius 10 meters. that spans an angle of
85:56 - pi over six radians, we know that the total
area of the circle is given by pi times 10
86:06 - meters squared, or 100 pi meter squared. But
we just want a fraction of that area to give
86:14 - us the area of our sector. So we want to take
the fraction of the circle that the sector
86:23 - makes times the area of the circle. Well,
the fraction of the circle is given by the
86:31 - angle of pi over six over the total angle
in the whole circle of two pi. And well times
86:41 - that by the 100 pi meter squared, that simplifies
to 100 pi over 12 meters squared, or 25 thirds
86:55 - pi meter squared as a decimal, that's 26.18
meter squared up to two decimal places. In
87:04 - general, if you want to find the area of a
sector, you can take the fraction of the circle
87:13 - that the sector spans out times the area of
the circle, pi r squared. Notice that the
87:21 - fraction of the circle is given by the angle
that the sector makes in radians, divided
87:28 - by the two pi radians in the circle. Since
the PI's cancel, we can simplify this formula
87:38 - by saying the area is given by theta over
two times r squared, where theta is the angle
87:47 - of the sector in radians. Again, it's important
that this angle be in radians, since that's
87:55 - how we're doing our fraction of our circle
comparison. As usual, r represents the radius
88:02 - of the circle. Notice that if you don't have
your angle in radians, if it's in degrees
88:08 - instead, not a big deal, because we can always
convert from degrees to radians first, before
88:13 - using our formula. In this video, we saw that
for our sector of angle theta, given in radians,
88:24 - the arc length is given by the formula theta
times R. And the area of the sector is given
88:33 - by theta over two times r squared, where r
is the radius of the circle. This video defines
88:42 - linear and radial speed for a rotating circle,
and explains how to convert between them.
88:50 - Consider a spinning wheel. The angular speed
is the angle it goes through in a unit of
88:57 - time, I can write that as angle per time,
the units will be something like radians per
89:08 - second if the angle is measured in radians,
and the time is measured in seconds, or I
89:12 - guess we could do degrees per minute, etc.
The linear speed is the speed of a point on
89:21 - the rim of the wheel. So that is the distance
a point on the rim of the wheel travel travels
89:33 - in a unit of time. I can think of that as
distance per time. And so it has units of
89:42 - something like meters per second for example,
or it could be feet per minute, etc. Suppose
89:51 - we have a ferris wheel with radius 20 meters.
That's making one revolution every two minutes,
90:01 - we want to find its angular speed and the
linear speed of a point on its rim. Now the
90:06 - Ferris wheel is going one revolution every
two minutes. So that's one half revolution
90:14 - per minute, I want to, I want to find the
angular speed, which is the angle it goes
90:21 - through in a unit of time. I've already got
a unit of time in the denominator minutes,
90:27 - but I've got to somehow convert revolutions
to angle. So my angular speed, one half revolutions
90:35 - per minute, one revolution, but that on the
bottom, so the units will cancel out. One
90:43 - revolution is going through an angle of two
pi radians. That means my angular speed is
90:51 - going to be one half times two pi radians
per minute, or pi radians per minute. The
91:03 - linear speed, the speed of a point on the
rim, well, the wheel is going pi radians per
91:12 - minute, I got to somehow convert radians into
distance. So I know that when I go to pi radians,
91:23 - so that's all the way around the circle, I'm
going all the way around the circumference
91:27 - and distance, so that would be two pi times
the radius, or two pi times 20 meters. The
91:34 - two PI's cancel as do the radians, and I'm
left with 20 pi meters per minute. Let's review
91:46 - how we got from angular speed to linear speed
in order to get a more general formula. I'll
91:52 - call the angular speed, omega looks like a
W, I'll call the linear speed v. In the previous
92:01 - problem, we found the linear speed v, by starting
with the angular speed omega, and multiplying
92:09 - it by the circumference divided by two pi.
That's because the point on the rim travels
92:17 - the whole circumference as it goes through
an angle of two pi all the way around the
92:23 - circle. So I'll write that down here, circumference
over two pi. But since I know that my circumference
92:33 - is given by the formula two pi r, and the
two PI's cancel, as they did in the previous
92:40 - problem, that shows that the linear speed
is the angular speed times r, where r is the
92:47 - radius of the circle. In this video, we defined
linear speed and radial speed, and found that
92:57 - linear speed was radial speed times the radius
of the circle. This video introduces the trig
93:04 - functions, sine, cosine, tangent, secant,
cosecant, and cotangent. For right triangles.
93:17 - For a right triangle, with sides of length
A, B, and C angle theta as drawn, we define
93:30 - sine of theta as the length of the opposite
side over the hypothesis, the side that's
93:39 - opposite to our angle theta has measure a
and I have partners is this side here with
93:44 - measure C. So that would be a oversee for
this triangle. Cosine of theta is defined
93:54 - as the length of the adjacent side, over the
length of hi partners. This side here is the
94:00 - side adjacent to theta. Of course, the hypothesis
is also adjacent to theta, but it's special
94:06 - as a partner, so we don't think of it as the
adjacent side. So that would be B oversea.
94:13 - tangent of theta is the opposite side length
over the adjacent side length, so that would
94:18 - be a over b. The pneumonic to remember this
is so toa, that's sine is opposite over hypotenuse.
94:33 - Cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse. And tangent
is opposite over adjacent. In fact, there's
94:44 - a relationship between tangent and sine and
cosine. Namely, tangent of theta is equal
94:52 - to sine of theta over cosine of theta. If
you want to see why that's that's because
94:59 - some of theta over cosine of theta is given
by a sine, which is opposite over hypothesis,
95:07 - divided by cosine, which is adjacent over
hypotenuse. If we compute these fractions
95:15 - by flipping and multiplying, the high partners,
length cancels, and we just get opposite over
95:25 - adjacent, which is, by definition, tangent
of theta. There are three more trig functions
95:31 - that are defined in terms of sine, cosine
and tangent. First of all, their sequence
95:37 - of theta, by definition, that's one over cosine
of theta. So it's going to be one over the
95:45 - adjacent over the partners, which is the high
partners over the adjacent, which in this
95:51 - triangle is C over B. cosecant of theta is
defined as one over sine theta. So that's
96:00 - one over the opposite over the hypotenuse,
which is the hypothesis over the opposite.
96:07 - And for this triangle, that's going to be
C over a. Finally, cotangent of theta is defined
96:14 - as one over tan theta. So that's going to
be one over opposite over adjacent, flip and
96:22 - multiply, I get adjacent over opposite, which
in this case is b over a. So notice that the
96:32 - values for cotangent cosecant and secant are
the reciprocals of the values for tangent,
96:41 - sine and cosine, respectively. Let's use these
definitions to find the exact values of all
96:49 - six trig functions for the angle theta in
this triangle. I'll start with a sine of theta.
96:56 - That's the opposite of our hypothesis. Well,
for this angle theta, the opposite side is
97:03 - down here and has measured to the high partners
has measured five, sine theta is two over
97:10 - five. Cosine theta is adjacent over hypotenuse,
but I don't know the value of the side length.
97:20 - But fortunately, I can find it using Bagaran
theorem says I have a right triangle here,
97:24 - I know that a squared, I'll call the side
length A plus B squared, where b is this other
97:33 - leg of the triangle is equal to c squared,
where c is the hypothesis. So here I have
97:39 - a squared plus two squared equals five squared,
which means that a squared plus four equals
97:45 - 25. A squared is 21. So A is plus or minus
the square root of 21. But since I'm talking
97:52 - about the length of a side of a triangle,
I can just use the positive answer. Returning
97:58 - to my computation of cosine theta, I can write
it as adjacent, which is the square root of
98:05 - 21. Over high partners, which is five, tangent
theta is the opposite over the adjacent, so
98:15 - that's going to be two over the square root
of 21. To compute secant of theta, that's
98:23 - one over cosine theta, so that's going to
be one over square root of 21 over five, which
98:30 - is five over the square root of 21. The reciprocal
of my cosine value. cosecant theta is one
98:41 - over sine theta, that's going to be the reciprocal
of my sine, so five halves, and cotangent
98:47 - theta is one over tan theta, so it's going
to be the reciprocal of my 10 value square
98:53 - root of 21. Over to finally, we'll do an application.
So if we have a kite that's flying at an angle
99:02 - of elevation as the angle from the horizontal
of 75 degrees, with a kite length string of
99:10 - 100 meters, we want to find out how high it
is I'll call the height Why? Well, we want
99:19 - to relate the known quantities this angle,
and this hypothesis, to the unknown quantity,
99:27 - the unknown quantity is the opposite side
of our triangle. So if we use sine of theta
99:34 - equals opposite of our hypothesis, then we
can relate these known amounts sine of 75
99:42 - degrees to our unknown amount y, which is
the opposite and our note amount of 100 meters.
99:49 - solving for y This gives that y is 100 meters
times sine of 75 degrees. We can use a calculator
99:56 - to compute sine of 75 degrees. Be sure Use
degree mode and not radian mode when you type
100:04 - in the 75. When I do the computation, I get
a final answer of 96.59 meters up to two decimal
100:16 - places. Notice that we're ignoring the height
of the person in this problem. To remember
100:22 - the definitions of the trig functions, you
can use the pneumonic, so tau, and the fact
100:29 - that secant is the reciprocal of cosine cosecant
the reciprocal of sine and cotangent the reciprocal
100:36 - of tangent. In this video, I'll use geometry
to compute the sine and cosine of a 30 degree
100:42 - angle, a 45 degree angle and a 60 degree angle.
One way to compute the sine of a 45 degree
100:51 - angle is to use a right triangle with a 45
degree angle. This particular right triangle
100:58 - has I have hotness of length one. Since all
the angles of the triangle have to add up
101:05 - to 180 degrees, and we already have 90 degrees
and 45 degrees, the remaining angle must also
101:13 - be 45 degrees. So we have an isosceles triangle
with two sides the same length, I'll call
101:19 - that side length a. If we want sine of 45
degrees, let's use this 45 degree angle here,
101:26 - then sine is opposite over hypotenuse. So
if I can figure out how long this side length
101:31 - is, I'll be able to compute sine of 45 degrees.
Now the Pythagorean theorem says this side
101:37 - length squared plus that side length squared
equals I have hot news squared. So we have
101:42 - that a squared plus a squared equals one squared.
Alright, that is two A squared equals one.
101:49 - So a squared is one half, and a is plus or
minus the square root of one half. Since we're
101:57 - talking about the length of sides of triangles,
I can just use the positive square root it's
102:04 - customary to rewrite this as the square root
of one over the square root of two, which
102:09 - is one over the square root of two, and then
rationalize the denominator by multiplying
102:13 - the top and the bottom by the square root
of two. That gives me square root of two in
102:18 - the numerator, and the square root of two
squared in the denominator, which is the square
102:22 - root of two over two. So the side lengths
are the square root of two over two. Now I
102:29 - can figure out the sine of 45 degrees, by
computing the opposite over the hypotenuse.
102:36 - That's, I'm looking at this angle. So opposite
is square root of two over two hypothesis
102:42 - one. So the sine of 45 degrees is the square
root of two over two. Cosine of 45 degrees
102:52 - is adjacent over hypotenuse. That's this side
length over this hypothesis. So that's the
102:59 - square root of two over to over one again,
what would happen if instead of using this
103:06 - triangle with hypotony is one, we use this
triangle, also a 4545 90 triangle, but with
103:12 - hypotony is five, not quite drawn to scale.
Please pause the video for a moment and repeat
103:18 - the computation with this triangle. This time,
I'll call the side length B. Pythagorean Theorem
103:26 - tells me b squared plus b squared equals five
squared. So two, b squared equals 25. And
103:32 - b squared equals 25 over two, B is going to
be the plus or minus the square root of 25
103:39 - over two, again, I can just use the positive
version. And so B is the square root of 25
103:45 - over the square root of two, which is five
over the square root of two, rationalizing
103:51 - the denominator, I get five root two over
two. Now sign of my 45 degree angle is opposite
104:01 - over her partners, which is five square root
of two over two divided by five. That simplifies
104:10 - to the square root of two over two as before,
and a similar computation shows that cosine
104:16 - of 45 degrees is also square root of two over
two as before. This makes sense, because sine
104:24 - and cosine are based on ratios of sides. And
since these two triangles are similar triangles,
104:30 - they'll have the same ratios of sides. To
find the sine and cosine of 30 degrees, let's
104:37 - use this 30 6090 right triangle with hypotony
is one. If we double the triangle, we get
104:48 - an angle of 30 here, so a total angle of 60
degrees here, and this angle is also 60 degrees.
104:55 - So we have a 60 6060 triangle. That's an equilateral
triangle. All side length the same. Since
105:02 - this side length has length one, this side
length is also one. This entire side length
105:10 - is one, which means this short side of our
original triangle has length one half. Going
105:17 - back to my original triangle, let's use the
Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of
105:22 - his longer side x. Pythagorean theorem says
x squared plus one half squared equals one
105:32 - squared. So x squared plus a fourth equals
1x squared is three fourths. And so x is plus
105:39 - or minus the square root of three fourths
is the positive version and get the square
105:45 - root of three over the square root of four,
which is the square root of three over two.
105:51 - Now using our original triangle, again, let's
compute the sine of this 30 degree angle here.
105:59 - We know that sine of 30 degrees is opposite
of our hypothesis. The opposite of this angle
106:07 - is one half and the hypothesis is one. So
we get a sine of one half over one, which
106:14 - is one half cosine of 30 degrees is adjacent
over hypotenuse. So that's the square root
106:22 - of three over two divided by one. To find
sine of 60 degrees and cosine of 60 degrees,
106:29 - we can actually use the same green triangle
and just focus on this upper corner angle
106:35 - of 60 degrees instead. So sine of 60 degrees.
Opposite overhype hotness, but this time the
106:45 - opposite to this angle is the square root
of three over two. Cosine of 60 degrees adjacent
106:55 - over hypotenuse gives us one half. I'll summarize
the results in this table below. Notice that
107:04 - a 30 degree angle corresponds to pi over six
radians since 30 degrees times pi over 180
107:14 - is pi over six. Similarly, 45 degrees corresponds
to pi over four radians and 60 degrees corresponds
107:22 - to pi over three radians. I recommend that
you memorize the three numbers one half, root
107:30 - two over two, and root three over two. And
the fact that one half and root three over
107:35 - two go together. And root two over two goes
with itself. From that information, it's not
107:45 - hard to reconstruct the triangles, you know
that a 4545 90 triangle is an isosceles triangle,
107:53 - so it must have the side links where the same
number goes with itself. And a 30 6090 triangle
108:02 - has one side length smaller than the other.
So the smaller side must be one half and the
108:08 - larger side must be root three over two since
root three is bigger than one and so root
108:13 - three over two is bigger than one half. Doing
a visual check, you can easily fill in the
108:21 - angles, the smaller angle must be the 30 degree
angle, and the larger one must be the 60 degree
108:28 - one. In this video, we computed the sine and
cosine of three special angles 30 degrees,
108:35 - 45 degrees, and 60 degrees. This video defined
sine and cosine in terms of points on the
108:45 - unit circle, a unit circle is a circle with
radius one. Up to now we defined sine and
108:53 - cosine and tangent in terms of right triangles.
For example, to find sine of 14 degrees in
108:59 - theory, you could draw a right triangle with
an angle of 14 degrees and then calculate
109:08 - the sign as the length of the opposite side
over the length of by partners. But if we
109:18 - use this method to try to compute sine of
120 degrees, things go horribly wrong. When
109:26 - we draw this 120 degree angle, and this right
angle, there's no way to complete this picture
109:31 - to get a right triangle. So instead, we're
going to use a unit circle that is a circle
109:38 - of radius one. The figure below illustrates
how right triangles and a unit circle are
109:44 - related. If you draw right triangles with
larger of hypotenuse one with larger and larger
109:51 - angles, then the top vertex sweeps out part
of a unit circle. Let's look at this relationship
109:58 - in more detail. In this figure, I've drawn
a right triangle inside a unit circle. The
110:07 - hypothesis of the triangle is the radius of
the circle, which is one, one vertex of the
110:14 - right triangle is at the origin. And another
vertex of the right triangle is at the edge
110:20 - of the circle, I'm going to call the coordinates
of that vertex A, B. Now the base of this
110:29 - right triangle has length a, the x coordinate,
and the height of the right triangle is B,
110:37 - the y coordinate. If I use the right triangle
definition of sine and cosine of theta, this
110:45 - right here is the angle theta, then cosine
of theta is adjacent over hypotenuse, so that's
110:53 - a over one, or a. Notice that a also represents
the x coordinate of this point on the unit
111:03 - circle, at angle theta from the x axis, I'll
write that down. For a sine of theta, if I
111:12 - use the right triangle definition, that's
opposite overhead partners. So b over one,
111:19 - which is just B. But B also represents the
y coordinate of this point in the on the unit
111:27 - circle at angle theta. For tangent theta,
if we use the right side triangle definition,
111:34 - its opposite over adjacent. So that's B over
A, I can think of that as the y coordinate
111:41 - of the point over the x coordinate of the
point. Now for angles theta, that can't be
111:47 - part of a right triangle, because they're
too big, they're bigger than 90 degrees, like
111:52 - now I'll call this angle here theta, I can
still use this idea of x and y coordinates
112:00 - to calculate the sine and cosine of theta.
So if I just mark this point, on the end of
112:08 - this line at angle theta, if I mark that to
have coordinates x and y, then cosine theta,
112:15 - I'm still going to define as the x coordinate
of this point, sine theta as the y coordinate,
112:23 - and tangent theta as the ratio of the y coordinate
over the x coordinate. When we use this unit
112:32 - circle definition, we always draw theta starting
from the positive x axis and going counterclockwise.
112:45 - Let's use this unit circle definition to calculate
sine, cosine and tangent of this angle fee.
112:51 - In our figure, we have a unit circle. And
these numbers are supposed to represent the
112:58 - x&y coordinates of this point on the unit
circle at the endpoint of this line segment,
113:06 - that lies at angle fee for the positive x
axis sign fee is equal to the y coordinate
113:17 - cosine fee is equal to the x coordinate. And
tangent of fee is given by the ratio of the
113:25 - two, which works out to negative 0.3639 up
to four decimal places. This video gives a
113:36 - method for calculating sine cosine and tangent
in terms of the unit circle. Starting from
113:42 - the positive x axis, you draw the angle theta
going counterclockwise. You look at the coordinates
113:52 - of the point on the unit circle where that
angle ends. And cosine of that angle theta
114:02 - is the x coordinate, sine of theta is the
y coordinate, and tangent of theta is the
114:11 - ratio. This video gives three properties of
the trig function sine and cosine, that can
114:16 - be deduced from the unit circle definition.
Recall that the unit circle definition of
114:22 - sine and cosine for an angle theta is that
cosine theta is the x coordinate. And sine
114:32 - of theta is the y coordinate for the point
on the unit circle at angle theta. The first
114:41 - property is what I call the periodic property.
This says that the values of cosine and sine
114:48 - are periodic with period two pi. And what
that means is that if you take cosine of an
114:54 - angle plus two pi, you get the same thing
as just if you took cosine of the angle So,
115:00 - when we write this down, we're assuming that
theta is measured in radians. If we want to
115:08 - measure theta in degrees, the similar statement
is that cosine of theta plus 360 degrees is
115:15 - equal to cosine of theta, we can make the
same statements for sine, sine of an angle
115:22 - plus two pi is equal to sine of the original
angle. Here, the angle being measured in radians.
115:30 - If we want to measure the angle in degrees,
the statement is that sine of theta plus 360
115:36 - is equal to sine of theta, we can see why
this is true from the unit circle definition
115:43 - of sine and cosine. This is our angle theta,
then theta plus two pi, the plus two pi adds
115:53 - a full turn around the unit circle to our
angles, so we end up at the same place, theta
115:59 - and theta plus two pi are just two different
names for the same location on the unit circle.
116:07 - And since sine and cosine give you the y and
x coordinates of that point on the circle,
116:11 - they have to have the same value. Similarly,
if we consider an angle theta, and an angle
116:18 - theta minus two pi, the minus two pi means
we go the other direction around the unit
116:25 - circle clockwise, we still end up in the same
place. And therefore, cosine of theta minus
116:32 - two pi, the x coordinate of that position
is the same thing as cosine of theta, sine
116:38 - of theta minus two pi is the same thing as
sine of theta, the same statements hold if
116:44 - we add or subtract multiples of two pi. For
example, cosine of theta plus four pi is still
116:51 - the same thing as cosine of theta, this time,
we've just gone to turns around the unit circle
116:57 - and still gotten back to the same place. So
if we want to find cosine of five Pi, that's
117:04 - the same thing as cosine of pi plus four pi,
which is the same thing as cosine of pi. Thinking
117:13 - about the unit circle, pi is halfway around
the unit circle. So cosine of pi means the
117:20 - x coordinate of this point right here. Well,
that point has coordinates negative one, zero,
117:26 - so cosine of pi must be negative one. If I
want to take sine of negative 420 degrees,
117:33 - well, that's sine of negative 360 degrees,
minus 60 degrees, which is the same thing
117:42 - as sine of minus 60 degrees. Thinking about
the unit circle, minus 60 degrees, means I
117:50 - start at the positive x axis and go clockwise
by 60 degrees that lands me about right here.
117:58 - And so that's one of the special angles that
has an x coordinate of one half a y coordinate
118:05 - of negative root three over two. And therefore
sine of negative 60 is negative root three
118:12 - over two the y coordinate. The next property
I call the even odd property, it says that
118:19 - cosine is an even function, which means that
cosine of negative theta is the same thing
118:25 - as cosine of theta, while sine is an odd function,
which means that sine of negative theta is
118:33 - the negative of sine of theta. To see why
this is true, let's look at an angle theta.
118:42 - And the angle negative theta. A negative angle
means you go in the clockwise instead of counterclockwise
118:48 - direction from the positive x axis. The coordinates
of this point by definition, r cosine theta
118:57 - sine theta, whereas the coordinates of this
point are cosine of negative theta, sine of
119:04 - negative theta. But by symmetry, these two
points have the exact same x coordinate, and
119:13 - therefore cosine of theta must equal cosine
of negative theta, while their y coordinates
119:20 - have the same magnitude, but opposite signs.
This one's positive and this one's negative.
119:27 - Therefore, sine of negative theta is the negative
of sine of theta. Let's figure out if tan
119:34 - of theta isn't even or odd function. Well,
we know that 10 of negative theta tangent
119:42 - by definition, is sine over cosine. Well,
we know that sine of negative theta is the
119:51 - negative of sine of theta, whereas cosine
of negative theta is cosine of theta. Therefore
120:00 - We're getting negative sine theta over cosine
theta, which is negative tan of theta. Since
120:09 - tan of negative theta is the negative of tan
of theta, tan theta is an odd function. The
120:20 - last property on this video is the Pythagorean
property, which says that cosine of theta
120:25 - squared plus sine of theta squared is equal
to one. A lot of times this property is written
120:32 - with this shorthand notation, cosine squared
theta plus sine squared theta equals one.
120:41 - But this notation, cosine squared theta just
means you take cosine of theta and square
120:48 - it. This property is called the Pythagorean
property, because it comes from the Pythagorean
120:55 - Theorem. Let me draw a right triangle on the
unit circle. I'll call this angle theta. So
121:02 - the coordinates of this endpoint here are
cosine theta sine theta. Since this is supposed
121:08 - to be a unit circle, the hypothesis of my
right triangle has length one, the base of
121:15 - my right triangle is just cosine theta, same
thing as the x coordinate of this point. And
121:22 - the height of my triangle is the y coordinate
of the point sine theta. Now the Pythagorean
121:28 - theorem says that this side length squared
plus that side of that squared equals one
121:35 - squared. Since one squared is the same thing
as one, that gives me the Pythagorean property.
121:42 - But the green property is handy for computing
values of cosine given values of sine and
121:48 - vice versa. And this problem, we're told that
sine of t is negative two sevenths. And T
121:54 - is an angle that lies in quadrant three. When
we say the angle lies in quadrant three, that
122:01 - means the terminal side of the angle lies
here in quadrant three. One way to find cosine
122:08 - of t is to use the fact that cosine squared
t plus sine squared t is equal to one. That
122:18 - is cosine of t squared plus negative 2/7 squared
is equal to one, I can write this as cosine
122:29 - of t squared plus 4/49 is equal to one. And
so cosine of t squared is equal to one minus
122:39 - 4/49, which is 4540 nights. taking the square
root of both sides, that goes for the cosine
122:48 - t is plus or minus the square root of 45 over
49, that's plus or minus the square root of
122:56 - 45 over seven. Now, since we're in the third
quadrant, we know that cosine of t, which
123:02 - represents the x coordinate of this point,
must also be negative. Therefore, cosine of
123:09 - t is going to be negative square root of 45
over seven. It's also possible to solve this
123:17 - problem using the Pythagorean theorem for
right triangles directly. If we look at the
123:23 - fact that sine of t is negative two sevens
and ignore the negative sign for now, we can
123:28 - think of this information as telling us that
we have a right triangle, angle theta, whose
123:35 - opposite side is to and whose high partners
is seven. We call this side here a them but
123:43 - Tiger in theorem says us a squared plus two
squared is seven squared. So a squared plus
123:50 - four is 49. So a squared is 45. And a is plus
or minus the square root of 45. Since I'm
123:58 - worrying about a triangle, I'm going to use
the positive value. Now, cosine of t is going
124:07 - to be adjacent over hypotenuse. So that's
going to be the square root of 45 over seven.
124:16 - Now I go back to thinking about positive and
negative signs. And I noticed that since I'm
124:22 - in the third quadrant, my co sign needs to
be negative, so I just stick a negative sign
124:28 - in front. This alternative solution uses many
of the same ideas as the previous solution,
124:35 - and ultimately gets us the same answer. This
video gives three properties of trig functions,
124:42 - the periodic property, the even odd property,
and the Pythagorean property. This video is
124:51 - about the graphs of sine and cosine. I want
to graph the functions y equals cosine t and
124:57 - y equals sine t, where t is in radians. I'm
going to think of this being the t axis, and
125:03 - this being the y axis. One way to do this
is to plot points. So I'll fill in this chart,
125:10 - using my knowledge of special angles on the
unit circle. These points will be easier to
125:16 - graph, if I convert them all to decimals.
Now a plot the points for cosine and connect
125:22 - the dots to get a graph of y equals cosine
t from t equals zero to t equals two pi. To
125:30 - continue the graph for t values less than
zero or bigger than two pi, I could plot more
125:36 - points. Or I could just use the fact that
the cosine values repeat. If I add or subtract
125:43 - two pi to the my angle T, I'll be at the same
place on the unit circle. So my cosine will
125:50 - be exactly the same. Therefore, my values
of cosine, which are represented by my y values
125:56 - on this graph, repeat themselves. For example,
when my T value is two pi plus pi over six
126:03 - about like here, it's cosine is the same as
the cosine of just pi over six. So I'll take
126:09 - this dot here and repeat it over here. Similarly,
the when t is like two pi plus pi over four,
126:18 - I get the same value of cosine is when it's
just pi over four. So this.is going to repeat,
126:24 - and I can continue repeating all my dots.
This one repeats over here at two pi plus,
126:31 - say pi over three. And so my whole graph will
repeat something like this. It also repeats
126:39 - on this side, something like this. Since subtracting
two pi from my t values will also give me
126:48 - the same value of cosine. We can also plot
points to get a graph for sine and extend
126:55 - it by repetition. Going forward, I'll usually
write the function sine and cosine as y equals
127:03 - cosine of x and y equals sine of x. When I
read it this way, notice that x now refers
127:11 - to an angle, while y refers to a value of
cosine, or sine. That's a different meaning
127:20 - of x and y, compared to when we're talking
about the unit circle, where x refers to the
127:24 - cosine value, and y refers to the sine value.
Now let's look at some properties of the graphs
127:30 - of sine and cosine. The first thing you might
notice is that the graph of cosine and the
127:36 - graph of sine are super similar to each other.
In fact, you can think of the graph of cosine
127:42 - as just being the graph of sine shifted to
the left by pi over two. So we can write cosine
127:49 - of x as the sine function of x plus pi over
two, since adding pi over two on the inside,
128:00 - move the graph horizontally to the left by
pi over two. Or we can think of the graph
128:07 - of sine as being constructed from the graph
of cosine by shifting the cosine graph right
128:13 - by pi over two, that means we can write sine
of x as equal to cosine of x minus pi over
128:19 - two, since subtracting pi over two on the
inside, shifts the cosine graph to the right
128:25 - by pi over two. Next, let's look at domain
and range. The domain of sine and cosine is
128:33 - all real numbers. Alright, that is negative
infinity to infinity, but the range is just
128:38 - from negative one to one. That makes sense,
because sine and cosine come from the unit
128:44 - circle. The input values for the domain come
from angles. And you can use any numbers and
128:50 - angle positive negative as big as you want,
just by wrapping a lot of times around the
128:54 - circle, the output values for the range, that
is the actual values of sine and cosine come
129:00 - from the coordinates on the unit circle. And
those coordinates can't be any bigger than
129:05 - one or any smaller than negative one. So that
gives us a range. As far as even an odd behavior,
129:11 - you can tell from the graph, here's cosine,
that it's symmetric with respect to the y
129:16 - axis, and so it must be even. Whereas the
graph of sine is symmetric with respect to
129:21 - the origin and must be odd. The absolute maximum
values of these two functions is one and the
129:28 - absolute minimum value is negative one. We
can also use the words midline amplitude and
129:36 - period to describe these two functions. The
midline is the horizontal line, halfway in
129:43 - between the maximum and minimum points. Here
the mid line is y equals zero. The amplitude
129:52 - is the vertical distance between a maximum
point and the midline. You can also think
129:58 - of the amplitude as the vertical distance
between a minimum point and the midline, or
130:03 - as half the vertical distance between a min
point and a max point. For the cosine function
130:09 - and the sine function, the amplitude is one.
A periodic function is a function that repeats
130:16 - at regular horizontal intervals, the horizontal
length of the smallest repeating unit is called
130:22 - the period. For y equals cosine of x, the
period is two pi. Notice that the period is
130:31 - the horizontal distance between successive
peaks, or maximum points, or between successive
130:38 - troughs, or minimum points. algebraically,
we can write cosine of x plus two pi equals
130:46 - cosine of x and sine of x plus two pi equals
sine of x to indicate that the functions repeat
130:55 - themselves over an interval of two pi and
have a period of two pi. In this video, we
131:02 - graphed y equals cosine of x and y equals
sine of x. and observe that they both have
131:11 - a midline at y equals zero, an amplitude of
one and a period of two pi. Sine you sort
131:23 - of functions are functions that are related
to sine and cosine by transformations like
131:29 - stretching and shrinking and shifting. This
video is about graphing these functions. Let's
131:36 - start by graphing the function y equals three
sine of 2x. This function is related to the
131:43 - function y equals sine x. So I'll graph that
first. Now, the three on the outside stretches
131:50 - this graph vertically by a factor of three,
while the two on the inside compresses that
131:58 - horizontally by a factor of one half. If instead
I want to graph y equals three sine 2x plus
132:05 - one, this plus one on the outside shifts everything
up by one unit. Let's compare the midline
132:14 - amplitude and period of our original y equals
sine x are transformed y equals three sine
132:25 - 2x, and are further transformed y equals three
sine 2x plus one, the original sign has a
132:32 - midline at y equals zero, an amplitude of
one and a period of two pi. For the transformed
132:42 - function, y equals three times sine of 2x.
The two on the inside shrinks everything horizontally
132:49 - by a factor of one half. So it changes the
period of two pi into a period of one half
132:58 - times two pi, which just pi. Since the two
on the inside only affects x values and horizontal
133:08 - distances, it doesn't affect the midline,
which is a y value, or the amplitude, which
133:13 - is a vertical distance. But the three on the
outside does affect these things. Well, in
133:18 - particular, it affects the amplitude, since
everything is stretched out vertically by
133:23 - a factor of three, the amplitude of one get
stretch to an amplitude of three. In this
133:31 - case, the midline doesn't actually change,
because multiplying a y value of zero by three
133:37 - is still a y value of zero. Now on the third
function, we've taken the second function
133:45 - and added one on the outside, so that shifts
everything up by one. Therefore, instead of
133:50 - having a midline at y equals zero, we now
have a midline at y equals one, the amplitude
133:57 - doesn't change though, it's still three, because
shifting everything up by one doesn't affect
134:01 - the distance between the mid mine and the
end the maximum point. Also, the period is
134:07 - still pi since the period is a horizontal
measure, and adding one on the outside only
134:12 - affects vertical things. Next, let's graph
the function y equals three times sine of
134:18 - two times quantity x minus pi over four. This
function is very closely related to the first
134:25 - function we graphed on the previous page,
that was y equals three sine of 2x. In fact,
134:32 - if we give the name f of x to that function,
and maybe we can call g of x, this other function,
134:42 - then we can get g of x by taking f of x and
plugging in x minus pi is pi over four in
134:50 - for x. In other words, g of x is f of x minus
pi over four. This relationship gives mean
135:00 - idea for graphing g of x the function we want
to graph, we can first graph f of x, we already
135:06 - did that on the previous page. And then we
can shift its graph to the right by pi over
135:16 - four, because that's what you do when you
subtract a number on the inside of a function.
135:23 - So here's the graph of y equals three sine
2x. Recall that it's just the graph of sine
135:31 - stretched vertically by a factor of three,
and shrunk horizontally by a factor of one
135:35 - half. Now, to graph the function that I want,
I'm going to shift this graph over by pi over
135:42 - four to the right. Notice that since I had
my function written in factored form, I could
135:48 - just read off the horizontal shift. But if
I had written it instead, as y equals three
135:57 - sine 2x minus pi over two, which is algebraically
equivalent, it would be easy to get confused
136:06 - and think that I needed to shift over by pi
over two. So it's best to factor first, before
136:13 - figuring out what the shift is, we're factoring
out the coefficient of x. If instead, we wanted
136:20 - to graph this function, same as the one we
just graphed, it's just with a minus one on
136:25 - the outside, that minus one would just bring
everything down by one. Let's take a moment
136:30 - to look at midline amplitude, and period for
the original parent function, y equals sine
136:41 - of x, and our final transformed function,
y equals three sine of two times quantity
136:48 - x minus pi over four minus one, our original
sine function has midline at y equals zero
136:56 - amplitude of one and period of two pi. For
our transform function, the three on the outside
137:04 - stretches vertically, so it makes the amplitude
three, the minus one on the outside shifts
137:14 - everything down by one. So it brings the midline,
y equals zero, down to Y equals negative one,
137:24 - the two on the inside, shrinks everything
horizontally by a factor of one half. So the
137:30 - period becomes one half times two pi, which
is pi. Finally, there's a horizontal shift
137:39 - going on, are transferring function shifts
to the right, by pi over four, this horizontal
137:51 - shift is sometimes called the phase shift.
The function we just analyzed was y equals
138:00 - three sine 2x minus pi over four minus one,
which could also be written as y equals three
138:10 - sine 2x minus pi over two minus one. This
is a function of the form y equals a sine
138:19 - B x minus c plus d, where b is positive. If
we have a function of this form, or the similar
138:26 - function with cosine in it, then we know that
the midline is going to be at y equals D.
138:35 - That's because the original midline of sine
or cosine at y equals zero gets shifted up
138:42 - by D, we know that the amplitude is going
to be a because this A multiplied on the outside
138:51 - stretches everything vertically by a factor
of a to be a little more accurate, we should
138:57 - say the amplitude is the absolute value of
A in case a is negative. If a is negative,
139:02 - then that amounts to a vertical reflection,
or a reflection over the x axis. We know that
139:10 - the period of the original sine or cosine
is two pi. And we know that this factor of
139:16 - B amounts to a horizontal shrink by a factor
of one over B, or I guess it could be a horizontal
139:23 - stretch by a factor of one over b if b is
less than one. So because we're starting with
139:30 - a period of two pi, and we're multiplying
by one over B, our new period is going to
139:37 - be two Pi over B. The trickiest thing is the
horizontal shift. And to get that right, I
139:46 - like to factor out this be from my equation.
So instead of writing y equals a cosine bx
139:55 - minus c plus d, I'm going to write y equals
A cosine B times quantity x minus c over b
140:03 - plus d. Similarly, if it's a sine function,
I write y equals a sine B times x minus quantity
140:10 - c over b plus d, then I can read off the horizontal
shift as C over B. And that'll be a shift
140:19 - to the right, if C ever be as positive and
a shift to the left, if C over b is negative,
140:25 - this might seem backwards from what you're
used to. But it's because we have that minus
140:28 - sign there. So if C over B is positive, we're
actually subtracting on the inside. So that
140:32 - shifts right, if C of b over b is negative
minus a negative is actually adding something,
140:37 - and that's why it shifts it to the left. So
as one final example, say I wanted to graph
140:42 - y equals 1/3, cosine of one half x plus three
minus five, that would have a midline at y
140:57 - equals minus five, an amplitude of 1/3, a
period of two pi divided by one half, which
141:09 - is four pi, and a horizontal shift. But a
rewrite this horizontal shift of six units
141:22 - to the left, the horizontal shift is sometimes
called the phase shift. And that's all for
141:33 - graphs of sinusoidal functions. This video
is about graphing the trig functions, tangent,
141:39 - secant, cotangent and cosecant. To gain an
intuition for the graph of y equals tangent
141:47 - of x, I think it's handy to look at the slope
of a line at angle theta on the unit circle.
141:56 - The slope of this line is the rise over the
run. But the rise is given by sine of theta,
142:06 - and the run is given by cosine of theta. So
the slope is given by sine theta over cosine
142:16 - theta, which is simply tan of theta. So if
I want to graph y equals tan of x, I can think
142:24 - of x as being the angle and y as being the
slope of the line at that angle. Notice if
142:36 - the angle is zero, the slope is zero. But
as the angle increases towards pi over two,
142:48 - the slope gets bigger and bigger heading towards
infinity. As the angle goes from zero towards
142:59 - negative pi over two, the slope is getting
negative and heading towards negative infinity,
143:06 - at exactly pi over two and negative pi over
two, we have a vertical line. And so the slope
143:15 - is undefined. Using this information, let's
graph a rough sketch of y equals tan x. Remember,
143:23 - we're thinking of x as the angle and y as
the slope, we're going to go between an angle
143:31 - of negative pi over two and pi over two. So
we said that the slope was zero when the angles
143:39 - zero, and then it heads up towards positive
infinity, as we go towards the angle goes
143:46 - towards pi over two with an undefined value
at pi over two, it goes negative heading towards
143:52 - negative infinity as the angle heads towards
negative pi over two, also, with an undefined
143:58 - value at negative pi over two, you can also
verify that for angles slightly bigger than
144:04 - pi over two, we have the same line as for
angles that are approaching negative pi over
144:12 - two, and therefore this picture repeats. And
it turns out that tangent is periodic with
144:26 - period not to pi, like sine and cosine, but
just pi. The period of pi makes sense because
144:35 - if you take a line and rotate it by 180 degrees,
it's the same line with the same slope and
144:43 - therefore has the same value of tangent in
this graph of y equals 10x knows that the
144:51 - x intercepts all right values of x of the
form negative two pi negative pi Zero, pi,
145:02 - two pi, etc, you can write that as pi times
k, where k is an integer that is a positive
145:13 - or negative whole number or zero. This makes
a lot of sense because tangent of x is sine
145:21 - of x over cosine of x. And so you're gonna
get x intercepts, that's where y is zero,
145:28 - which is where the numerator is zero, and
sine x is zero, at values of the form pi,
145:37 - two pi, and so on. From the graph, you can
see the vertical asymptotes are at values
145:44 - like negative three pi over two, negative
pi over two, pi over two, and three pi over
145:51 - two, these values can be written as pi over
two times k, where k is an odd integer. Again,
146:00 - this makes sense from the definition of tangent,
since the vertical asymptotes will occur where
146:05 - the denominator is zero, and cosine x is zero,
at numbers, like negative pi over two pi over
146:12 - two, three pi over two, and so on, the domain
of tangent is the x axis for which it's defined.
146:20 - So that's going to be everything except for
the vertical asymptotes, we can write that
146:24 - as x such that x is not equal to pi over two
times k, for K, an odd integer. The range
146:35 - or the y values go all the way from negative
infinity to infinity. And the period, as we
146:41 - mentioned previously, is pi. Since the smallest
repeating unit has a horizontal width of pi,
146:53 - to graph y equals secant x, I'm going to remember
that secant is one over cosine. So if I start
147:01 - with a graph of cosine, I can take the reciprocal
of the y values to get the graph of secant,
147:08 - the reciprocal of one is one, the reciprocal
of zero is undefined, so I'm not going to
147:15 - have a value at pi over two, negative pi over
two, three pi over two, or negative three
147:23 - pi over two. When I take the reciprocal of
numbers, just less than one, I'm going to
147:29 - get numbers just greater than one, but I would
take the reciprocal of positive numbers getting
147:34 - close to zero, I'm going to get really big
positive numbers going up towards infinity.
147:41 - Similarly, on the other side, over here, I
have numbers close to zero, but negative,
147:49 - so their reciprocals will be negative numbers
heading towards negative infinity, the reciprocal
147:55 - of negative one is negative one. And similarly
here, so I'm getting kind of positive and
148:02 - negative buckets and upside down buckets as
the graph of my sequence. Notice that secant
148:11 - has a period of two pi, which makes sense,
since cosine has a period of two pi, it has
148:17 - a range that goes from negative infinity to
negative one inclusive, and from one to infinity.
148:25 - That makes sense because the range of cosine
is between one and negative one, and we're
148:30 - taking the reciprocal of those values. The
domain is everything except for the vertical
148:35 - asymptotes. Now the vertical asymptotes are
where cosine is zero. So that is at values
148:48 - of the form pi over two, three pi over two,
etc. That's values of the form pi over 2k,
148:54 - where k is an odd integer. So the domain is
going to be x values such that x is not equal
149:03 - to pi over 2k. For K and odd integer. The
x intercepts of secant Well, it doesn't have
149:13 - any, because you can't take one over something
and get the numbers zero for your y value.
149:23 - We've seen the graph of y equals tan x and
y equals secant x. This is the graph of y
149:32 - equals cotangent x. It looks similar to the
graph of tangent x, it's just a decreasing
149:38 - function instead of an increasing one, and
it has its vertical asymptotes and its x intercepts
149:45 - in different places. Finally, this green graph
is the graph of y equals cosecant x. It's
149:55 - related to the graph of sine x, since cosecant
is one over sine x. And in fact, if I draw
150:02 - the graph of sine x in between, you can see
how it kind of bounces off. Because it's the
150:09 - reciprocal. I encourage you to memorize the
general shape of these graphs, you can always
150:15 - figure out the details by thinking how about
how they're related to the graphs of cosine
150:24 - of x, and sine x. This video is about the
graphs of transformations of tangent, secant
150:33 - cotangent and cosecant. Before I graph this
fancy function, I'm going to graph the related
150:40 - parent function, y equals cosecant of x. Recall
that cosecant of x is one over sine of x.
150:50 - So the graph of cosecant of x has a vertical
asymptotes, where sine of x is zero, that
150:57 - puts the vertical asymptotes at pi, two pi,
zero, and so on. Because seeing n of x is
151:07 - one where sine is one. So here, and so it
looks something like this. Now, when I graph
151:16 - my fancy function, I know that the two on
the outside does a vertical stretch by two,
151:24 - the plus one shifts up by one, the PI means
everything shrinks horizontally by one over
151:38 - pi. And so the period, instead of being two
pi, like it is for cosecant, it's going to
151:44 - be two pi divided by pi, which is two. Finally,
this pi over two has to do with a horizontal
151:53 - shift. But in order to see by how much we
horizontal shift, we need to factor out the
151:58 - pie first. So if I rewrite my function, as
two times cosecant pi times x plus a half,
152:08 - plus one, I can see the horizontal shift is
one half to the left. Let me do those transformations
152:15 - in pieces. First, I'll do the vertical motions.
So I'll leave the horizontal axis as is I'll
152:22 - stretch by a factor of two. And now I'll shift
up by one. Next, I'll worry about the horizontal
152:30 - motion, instead of a period of two pi, I'm
going to have a period of two. But in addition,
152:38 - everything is going to be shifted left by
one half. So instead of having my vertical
152:43 - asymptotes at zero, pi, two pi and so on,
they would be at 012, and so on, except everything
152:57 - shifted over by one half. So that means the
vertical asymptotes will actually be at negative
153:05 - a half, a half, one and a half, and so on.
Another way to find the vertical asymptotes
153:16 - is by noting that cosecant is one over sine,
so therefore, cosecant pi x plus one half
153:27 - does not exist when a sine pi x plus one half
equals zero, ie when pi times x plus one half
153:44 - is equal to a multiple of pi. canceling the
PI's and solving for x, that's when x is some
153:54 - number minus a half. So those are exactly
the values of say, one half, three half, five
154:03 - halves, and so on that we've drawn. So once
we've got the vertical asymptotes in place,
154:09 - we can see that our graph fits in between
them. This purple piece got shrunk horizontally
154:17 - and shifted by a half, so it ends up hugging
the x axis. I'll draw it in right here. And
154:24 - all the other pieces also get shrunk horizontally
and shifted. So my final graph looks something
154:32 - like this. In this next problem, we're given
the graph and we need to find the equation,
154:41 - the shape of the graph. And the fact that
it's increasing tells us it must be a tangent
154:49 - graph. But y equals tan x by itself would
have a period of pi. Let's check what our
154:58 - graph has a period of need to find the horizontal
width of one complete cycle, it's probably
155:06 - easiest to measure if I sketch in the vertical
asymptotes, which seem to run from an x value
155:12 - of negative three to an x value of one. So
that's a horizontal distance of four. So our
155:18 - graph might be something more like tan of
Bx, where pi over B has to be four. That means
155:30 - that pi equals four B. And so B is pi over
four. So our graph is probably more closely
155:38 - related to Y equals tan of pi over 4x. But
if it were exactly y equals tan of pi over
155:47 - 4x, then that middle point right here would
be at the origin. And instead, that middle
155:54 - point is at negative one, one, that means
my tangent graph is shifted left by one, and
156:03 - up by one, the left by one, I can accomplish
by writing x plus one, when I have the Pi
156:14 - over four factored out the up by one I get
by writing a plus one on the outside. Now
156:21 - as possible, there might also be a vertical
stretch factor out front, an easy way to check
156:27 - for that is by plugging in x equals zero and
seeing whether what kind of number out in
156:33 - front I might need to get this y intercept
of two. So I'm going to write y equals a tan
156:41 - pi over four quantity x plus one plus one,
plug in point 02. So that's two equals a tan
156:54 - pi over four, zero plus one plus one. And
I can solve for A since tan of pi over four
157:03 - is just one, this equation simplifies to two
equals a times one plus one, which means that
157:11 - a has to be one. So in fact, this equation
here is our final answer for this graph. To
157:20 - summarize, if we have a function of the form
y equals a tan bx minus c plus d, the number
157:27 - a accomplishes a vertical stretch. The number
B changes the period from pi to pi over B,
157:44 - the number D shifts vertically by D. And finally,
to figure out what the number c is, we have
157:57 - to rewrite our equation in factored form factoring
out the B. And so we see that there's a phase
158:06 - shift right by C over B. The same things hold.
If instead of tangent, we have a graph of
158:18 - cotangent, we can say the same things for
our graph of secant and a graph of cosecant.
158:26 - The only thing to be careful of is that B
now changes the period from two pi to two
158:36 - pi over B, simply because the original period
of secant and cosecant is two pi, whereas
158:47 - the original period of tan and co tan is just
pi. If you know what the original graphs of
158:57 - tan, secant cotangent and cosecant look like,
you can use your knowledge of transformations
159:03 - to graph more complicated functions. This
video defines the standard inverse trig functions,
159:11 - sine inverse cosine inverse and tan inverse.
In this crazy looking graph, please focus
159:21 - first on the thin black line. This is a graph
of y equals sine x. The graph of the inverse
159:27 - of a function can be found by flipping the
graph of the original function over the line
159:32 - y equals x. I've drawn the flipped graph with
this blue dotted line. But you'll notice that
159:40 - the blue dotted line is not the graph of a
function because it violates the vertical
159:44 - line test. So in order to get a function,
that's the inverse of y equals sine x, we
159:51 - need to restrict the domain of sine of x.
We'll restrict it to this piece that's drawn
159:58 - with a thick black line. If I invert that
piece, by flipping it over the line y equals
160:04 - x, I get the piece drawn with a red dotted
line here. And that piece does satisfy the
160:10 - vertical line test. So it is in fact, a function
of the regular sine x has domain from negative
160:17 - infinity to infinity are restricted sine x
has domain from negative pi over two to pi
160:24 - over two. It's, its range is still from negative
one to one, just like the regular sine x.
160:33 - Because I've taken the biggest possible piece
of the graph, whose flipped version is still
160:39 - a function. The inverse sine function is often
written as arc sine of x. And since inverting
160:49 - a function reverses the roles of y at x, it
reverses the domain and the range. So arc
160:57 - sine of x, the inverse function has domain
from negative one to one, and range from negative
161:03 - pi over two to pi over two, which seems plausible
from the graph. Now an inverse function undoes
161:11 - the work a function. So if the function sine
takes angles theta, two numbers, x, then the
161:22 - inverse sine, or arc sine takes numbers x,
two angles theta. For example, since sine
161:33 - of pi over two is one, arc sine of one is
pi over two. And in general, the output of
161:42 - arc sine of x is the angle between negative
pi over two and pi over two whose side is
161:51 - x. y is equal to arc sine x means that x is
equal to sine of y. But since there are many
161:59 - angles, y who sine is x, right, they all differ
by multiples of two pi, we specify also, that
162:06 - y is between negative pi over two and pi over
two. That was the whole point of doing this
162:13 - domain restriction in order to get a well
defined inverse value. There's an alternate
162:19 - notation for inverse sine. Sometimes it's
written as sine to the negative one of x.
162:25 - But this notation can be confusing, so be
careful. In particular, sign to the negative
162:33 - one of x does not equal one over sine of x.
One over sine of x the reciprocal function
162:41 - is another word for cosecant of x. But sine
to the negative one of x is another word for
162:48 - arc sine of x, the inverse sine function,
which is not the same thing as the reciprocal
162:55 - function, let's go through the same process
to build an inverse cosine function, we start
163:03 - with a graph of cosine of x, we flip it over
the line y equals x to get the blue dotted
163:10 - line. But the blue dotted line is not a function.
So we go back and restrict the domain for
163:16 - our original cosine of x to just be between
zero and pi. The resulting red graph now satisfies
163:24 - the vertical line test. So it's a proper inverse
function. Our restricted cosine has domain
163:30 - from zero to pi, and range from negative one
to one. And so our inverse function, arc cosine
163:39 - has domain from negative one to one, and range
from zero to pi. Since cosine takes us from
163:47 - angles to numbers, arc cosine takes us from
numbers back to angles. For example, cosine
163:58 - of pi over four is the square root of two
over two. So arc cosine of the square root
164:04 - of two over two is equal to pi over four.
arc cosine of x is the angle between zero
164:14 - and pi, whose cosine is x. In other words,
y equals r cosine of x means that x is equal
164:24 - to cosine of y. And y is between zero and
pi, since otherwise, there'd be lots of possible
164:32 - answers for an angle y whose cosine is x.
The alternative notation for arc cosine is
164:40 - cosine inverse. And again, we have to be careful.
cosine to the negative 1x is not the same
164:49 - thing as one over cosine of x. one over cosine
of x is also called secant of x. cosine to
164:57 - the negative 1x means arc cosine On the inverse
function, and these two things are not the
165:03 - same. Finally, let's look take a look at inverse
tangent function. Here's a graph of tangent,
165:14 - and black. These vertical lines aren't really
part of the function there, just vertical
165:19 - asymptotes. So in order to get the actual
function, when we flip over the line y equals
165:26 - x, we take just one piece of the tangent function.
Here, we've taken the piece marked in black,
165:34 - we flip that over the line y equals x, we
get this piece in red, which is actually a
165:40 - function because it satisfies the vertical
line test. Now, you might ask, would it be
165:45 - possible to pick a different piece of the
tangent function to invert? And the answer
165:52 - is, yes, we could do that. And on another
planet, maybe mathematicians do that. But
165:58 - on our planet, we use the convention that
we pick this piece of tangent to invert, which
166:05 - is kind of a convenient choice since it's
centered here around the origin. In the previous
166:11 - two examples, our choice of restricted domain
for sine and for cosine was also a convention
166:17 - that led to a conveniently defined inverse
function. In any case, based on our choice,
166:24 - our restricted tan function has domain from
negative pi over two to pi over two. We don't
166:31 - include the endpoints in that interval, because
our restricted tan function has vertical asymptotes
166:37 - at negative pi over two and pi over two, so
it's not defined there. The range of our restricted
166:43 - tan function is from negative infinity to
infinity. Therefore, arc tan of X has domain
166:53 - from negative infinity to infinity, and range
from negative pi over two to pi over two.
167:00 - Once again, tangent is taking us from angles
to numbers. So arc tan is taking us from numbers
167:08 - to angles. For example, tangent of pi over
four is one, and therefore, arc tan of one
167:20 - is pi over four. So arc tan of x means the
angle between negative pi over two and pi
167:30 - over two whose tangent is x. y is equal to
arc tan x means that x is equal to tangent
167:40 - of y. And that y is between negative pi over
two and pi over two. The inverse tan function
167:52 - can also be written as 10 to the minus one
of x. And once again, tan inverse of x means
168:02 - the inverse trig function, arc tan of x. And
it's not equal to one over tan of x, which
168:15 - is called cotangent of x. And that's all for
this video on the three basic inverse trig
168:25 - functions. sine inverse x, also known as arc
sine of x, cosine inverse x, also known as
168:33 - arc cosine x, and tan inverse x, also known
as arc tan x. This video is an introduction
168:41 - to solving trig equations. Let's start with
the equation two cosine x plus one equals
168:48 - zero, I want to find all the solutions in
the interval from zero to two pi, and then
168:53 - get a general formula for all solutions, not
just those in that interval. Let me start
168:59 - by rewriting this equation to isolate the
tricky part, which is cosine of x. So I'm
169:06 - going to write two cosine x equals negative
one, and then divide both sides by two. Now
169:15 - I'm looking for the angles x between zero
and two pi whose cosine is negative one half.
169:24 - Since negative one half is one of the special
values on the unit circle, I can use my knowledge
169:30 - of the unit circle to see that the angle between
zero and two pi must be either two pi over
169:39 - three, or four pi over three. My answer needs
to include both of these values. There are
169:48 - no other spots on the unit circle whose cosine
is negative one half. But there are more angles
169:54 - because we can always take one of these angles
and add multiples of two pi to it. So if I
169:59 - want to Find all solutions, I can take these
two principles solutions, two pi over three,
170:07 - and four pi over three, and simply add multiples
of two pi to them, for example, two pi over
170:13 - three plus two pi, or two pi over three minus
two pi, two pi over three plus four pi, and
170:21 - so on. A much more efficient way to write
this is to write two pi over three plus two
170:30 - pi times k, any integer that is any positive
or negative whole number, or zero. Similarly,
170:41 - I can write four pi over three plus two pi
k, to capture all solutions, based on the
170:50 - principal solution for pi over three by adding
and subtracting multiples of two pi. This
170:55 - is my final solution. Next, let's look at
a trig equation involving tangent. As usual,
171:05 - I'm going to start out by cleaning things
up and isolating the tricky part, which in
171:09 - this case is tangent. So let me add tangent
to both sides. That'll give me three, tan
171:19 - x equals the square root of three. And so
tan x is the square root of three over three,
171:27 - the square root of three over three looks
suspiciously similar to value the value of
171:32 - square to three over two, which is a special
value on my unit circle. So my suspicion is
171:37 - that my unit circle will again, help me find
this value of x without a calculator. Recall
171:43 - that tan x is sine x over cosine x. So I'm
looking for angles on the unit circle between
171:53 - zero and two pi with a ratio of sine over
cosine will give me square root of three over
171:59 - three, I actually only need to look in the
first quadrant, and the third quadrant, because
172:05 - those are the quadrants where a tangent is
positive. And I really only need to look at
172:12 - angles whose either sine or cosine has a squared
of three in it. So by trial and error, I can
172:19 - see that tan pi over six, which is sine pi
over six over cosine pi over six, will give
172:32 - me one half over root three over two, that's
the same thing as one half times two over
172:38 - three, which is one over root three. If I
rationalize that, I get root three over three.
172:45 - So that value works. If I try tan of pi over
three, instead, I get root three, which is
172:56 - not equal to root three over three. So pi
over three doesn't work. Similarly, I can
173:02 - work out some the values in the third quadrant
and see that seven pi over six works. But
173:11 - four pi over three does not. So my answer
to part A includes just two values, pi over
173:21 - six, and seven pi over six. Now if I want
to find all solutions, not just those in the
173:29 - interval from zero to two pi, I noticed that
I can take one of these principal solutions
173:35 - and add multiples of two pi to it, because
that'll give me the same angle. So I get pi
173:42 - over six plus two pi k, and pi over six, sorry,
seven pi over six plus two pi k, any integer.
173:58 - This is a correct answer. But it's not as
simple as it could be. Notice that seven pi
174:03 - over six over here on the unit circle is exactly
pi more than pi over six. So instead of taking
174:10 - both of these and adding multiples of two
pi to them, I could get all the same answers
174:15 - by just taking one of them and adding multiples
of pi to it. So a more efficient answer is
174:22 - to say that x equals pi over six plus pi times
k for K any integer. This will still capture
174:34 - all the same solutions. Because when k is
even, I'll get this family of solutions. And
174:39 - when k is odd, I'll get this family. For example,
when k is one pi over six plus one times pi
174:47 - is just the original seven pi over six. If
you think about the fact that tangent has
174:53 - a period of pi instead of two pi, it makes
a lot of sense that you should be able to
174:58 - write the solutions in the form. In this video,
we solved basic trig equations by first, isolating
175:09 - sine, or tangent, or the same thing would
work with cosine. And then using the unit
175:18 - circle to find principal solutions, Principal
solutions are just solutions between zero
175:28 - and two pi. And then adding multiples of two
pi to these principles solutions to get all
175:39 - solutions. For tangent, we noticed that it
was equivalent to just use one principal solution
175:45 - and add multiples of pi instead of two pi.
In a previous video, we looked at trig equations
175:53 - that can be solved using the unit circle.
In this video, we'll solve trig equations
175:59 - that don't involve special values on the unit
circle, and require a calculator instead to
176:04 - solve. Let's look at the equation two cosine
t equals one minus cosine t. As usual, I'll
176:13 - start by simplifying and isolating cosine.
Adding cosine to both sides, I get three cosine
176:19 - t equals one divided by three gives cosine
t equals 1/3. Now 1/3 is not one of my special
176:28 - values on the unit circle, but I can locate
it approximately cosine represents the x value
176:36 - of a point on the unit circle. So I'm looking
for a point on the unit circle whose x coordinate
176:41 - is approximately 1/3. So maybe right here,
and the symmetric angle right here, those
176:48 - are angles in the first and fourth quadrants.
To get a decimal approximation for one of
176:54 - these angles, I can take arc cosine of both
sides of my equation. This gives me t equals
177:02 - arc cosine of 1/3, which, using my calculator
on radian mode, I get a decimal approximation
177:09 - of 1.2310. Up to four decimal places, it's
important to use radian mode here. Since by
177:18 - convention, the answers to trig equations
are expected to be in radians unless otherwise
177:25 - specified. It's also important to notice that
these two equations are not precisely the
177:31 - same thing. Since cosine t equals 1/3, has
infinitely many solutions if we don't restrict
177:40 - to a certain interval, and even if we restrict
to the interval zero to two pi, it still has
177:45 - two different solutions. On the other hand,
our T equals arc cosine of 1/3 has only one
177:53 - solution. And that solution lies between the
angles of zero and pi. So this angle here,
178:04 - the 1.231, a radians must be giving us this
angle, so there's got to be an angle between
178:10 - zero and pi. And to get the other angle this
one, we can use the symmetry of the situation.
178:19 - This angle and this angle are the same size.
So to get all the way around to here, we can
178:24 - go all the way to pi minus r 1.2312 radians.
Using our calculator again, we can compute
178:33 - that two pi minus 1.2310 radians is equal
to 5.05 to two radians. So our two solutions
178:44 - on our interval from zero to two pi, are given
by 1.2310 and 5.05 to two radians. Let me
178:55 - emphasize that we found the second solution
by taking two pi minus the first solution.
179:07 - Now it's straightforward to find all solutions,
we can just take our two principal solutions
179:12 - and add multiples of two pi. It can be helpful
to look at this solution graphically. To solve
179:21 - our equation, cosine t equals 1/3. We want
to know where this graph of y equals cosine
179:31 - of t intersects the horizontal line at y equals
1/3. This intersection point here corresponds
179:40 - to our first solution of 1.2310 radiance.
This intersection point here corresponds to
179:48 - our second solution. Notice that it occurs
at a T value, that's two pi minus this T value
179:56 - here and all the other initial action points
correspond to those first two intersection
180:03 - points shifted over by multiples of two pi.
Next, let's look at the equation for sine
180:12 - x minus one equals two. I'll start by rewriting
this as four sine x equals three, which is
180:20 - equivalent to sine x equals three fourths.
Although three fourths is not a special value
180:26 - on the unit circle, we can still use the unit
circle to get oriented and see how many solutions
180:32 - there should be in the interval from zero
to two pi. Since sine represents the y coordinate
180:38 - of a point on the unit circle, we're looking
for points on the unit circle whose y coordinate
180:42 - is three fourths. So that might be three fourths
might be about here. So that would be an angle
180:47 - about right here. And about right here, so
in the first and second quadrants, let's take
180:56 - the arc sine of both sides to find one of
those angles. I'm getting one of the angles
181:03 - to be arc sine of three fourths, which my
calculator says is 0.8481 radians, that must
181:12 - be this angle here. To get the other angle,
I can use symmetry. Since this angle here,
181:22 - you can get by going up four pi minus my previous
angle, pi minus 0.8481, is equal to 2.2935.
181:35 - So that's my second angle. Notice that this
time, to get the second angle, we use pi minus
181:44 - the first angle, not to pi minus the first
angle like we did for cosine. Once again,
181:51 - we can find all solutions simply by adding
multiples of two pi, we can also locate the
181:57 - solutions on a graph of sine, we're looking
for where the graph of y equals sine of x
182:05 - intersects with the horizontal line at y equals
three fourths. And we can see that we have
182:13 - these two solutions where the second one,
its x value is pi minus the x value this one,
182:23 - and then we have all these additional solutions
that we can get by shifting over by positive
182:30 - and negative multiples of two pi from the
first to finally, let's solve the equation
182:35 - 10x equals four. If we simply take x to be
tan inverse of four, which is 1.3258 radians,
182:48 - we'll get a single solution. But thinking
about the graph of tangent, and intersecting
182:57 - that graph with the horizontal line y equals
four, we see that there should actually be
183:05 - two solutions in the interval from zero to
two pi. This makes sense, because the period
183:14 - of tangent is pi. So any one solution will
get repeated. By intervals of pi. It also
183:24 - makes sense by thinking about the unit circle.
Tangent, which can be thought of as the slope
183:31 - of a line at angle theta takes on all positive
real values, both in the first quadrant and
183:38 - the third quadrant. So there are going to
be two places on the unit circle where the
183:44 - tangent is for. We've already found this one.
To find the other one, we just need to add
183:51 - pi. This gives us our answer for the interval
zero to two pi. And we can add multiples of
183:58 - two pi to get all other solutions. Or if we
want to be more efficient, we can just write
184:04 - the first solution plus multiples of pi instead
of two pi. Because these two solutions differ
184:12 - by exactly pi. Taking the first solution,
and then adding multiples of pi will capture
184:20 - all solutions corresponding to both of these
principal solutions. To summarize, to find
184:28 - our solutions to cosine t equals m, we need
to find first cosine inverse of m. Then take
184:38 - two pi a minus this solution and add multiples
of two pi to both of those. To find solutions
184:47 - to the equation, sine t equals n. We can start
by taking sine inverse of n using pi minus
184:57 - this and adding multiples of to pi. To find
our solutions to tangent t equals P, we can
185:07 - take t equal tan inverse of P, and tan inverse
of p plus pi and add multiples of two pi.
185:19 - Or we can just take 10 inverse of P, and add
multiples of pi. Although the examples that
185:27 - we saw were more simple than some, because
for the examples, we saw, the inverse trig
185:33 - function always landed us in the first quadrant,
these methods will work more generally. That's
185:40 - all for this video on solving trig equations
that require a calculator. This video is about
185:47 - identities involving trig functions like sine
and cosine. But I want to start with some
185:52 - examples that just involve quadratic functions.
If I want to find the solutions to this equation,
186:00 - I can rewrite it x squared minus 6x minus
seven equals zero, factor it, x minus seven
186:09 - times x plus one equals zero, set the factors
equal to 0x minus seven equals zero, or x
186:17 - plus one equals zero. And that gives me the
solutions, x equals seven, or x equals negative
186:24 - one. Next, let's look at this more complicated
equation. I'm going to try to solve that for
186:32 - x by multiplying out the right hand side.
Next, our combined terms on the right hand
186:40 - side. So that gives me x squared minus 6x.
On both sides, well, x squared minus 6x is
186:51 - equal to x squared minus 6x. That's true no
matter what I plug in for x. And therefore,
186:58 - all values of x satisfy this equation, we
can say that the solution set is all real
187:05 - numbers. The second equation is called an
identity, because it holds for all values
187:16 - of the variable. The first equation, on the
other hand is not an identity, because it
187:22 - only holds for some values of x and not all
values. Please pause the video for a moment
187:28 - and try to decide which of the following three
equations or identities that is, which of
187:34 - these equations hold for all values of the
variable. To start out, you might want to
187:41 - test them by plugging in a few values of the
variable and see if the equation holds. The
187:49 - first equation is not an identity. It does
hold for some values of x. For example, if
187:56 - x equals zero, then sine of two times zero
is zero, and two times sine of zero is also
188:05 - zero. So it does hold when x is zero. However,
when x is say, pi over two, then sine of two
188:14 - times pi over two, that's the same thing as
sine of pi, which is zero, but two times sine
188:21 - of pi over two, that's two times one, or two,
and zero is not equal to two. So the equation
188:30 - does not hold for x equals pi over two. Since
it doesn't hold for all values of the variable,
188:36 - it's not an identity. The second equation
is an identity. You can build some evidence
188:44 - for this by plugging in numbers. For example,
cosine of zero plus pi, which is negative
188:51 - one is the same thing as negative of cosine
of zero. You can also check for example, that
188:58 - cosine of pi over six plus pi is the same
thing as negative cosine of pi over six. But
189:04 - even if we check a zillion examples, that's
just evidence, it's not a proof that the identity
189:09 - holds, we could have just gotten lucky with
the values we picked, we can build a little
189:14 - bit stronger evidence by looking at graphs,
I'm going to put theta on the x axis in a
189:22 - pie graph, y equals cosine of theta plus pi.
That's just like the graph of cosine shifted
189:31 - over to the left by pi. On the other hand,
if I graph y equals negative cosine theta,
189:38 - that's the graph of cosine theta, reflected
across the x axis, which gives us the exact
189:46 - same graph. So graphing both sides gives us
strong evidence that this equation is an identity
189:54 - it holds for all values of theta. Now the
strongest evidence of all would be an algebraic
189:59 - proof, which we'll do later in the course,
once we have a formula for the cosine of a
190:05 - sum of two angles. In the meantime, let's
look at equation C. It turns out equation
190:13 - C is an identity. And we could build evidence
for it again by plugging in values for x,
190:19 - or by graphing the left side and the right
side separately, and checking to see that
190:25 - the graphs coincided. But for this example,
I'm going to go ahead and do an algebraic
190:30 - verification. In particular, I'm going to
start with the left side of the equation and
190:37 - rewrite things and rewrite things until I
get to the right side of the equation. The
190:42 - first thing I'll rewrite is secant and tangent
in terms of their constituent functions, sine
190:48 - and cosine. Since secant of x is one over
cosine x, and tangent of x is sine x over
190:54 - cosine x, I can rewrite this expression as
one over cosine x minus sine x times sine
191:05 - x over cosine x. I can clean up those fractions
and write this as one over cosine x minus
191:15 - sine squared x over cosine x. Now, I noticed
that I have two fractions with the same denominator.
191:23 - So I can pull them together as one minus sine
squared x over cosine x. Next, I'm going to
191:33 - rewrite the numerator one minus sine squared
x using the Pythagorean identity that says
191:40 - that cosine squared x plus sine squared x
equals one, and therefore, one minus sine
191:49 - squared x is equal to cosine squared x just
by subtracting sine squared x from both sides.
191:59 - So I can replace my numerator, one minus sine
squared x with cosine squared x. And canceling
192:10 - one cosine from the top and from the bottom,
that's the same thing as cosine of x, which
192:16 - is the right hand side that I was trying to
get to. So a combination of a bunch of algebra,
192:22 - and the Pythagorean identity allows me to
prove that this equation is true for all values
192:28 - of x, it's an identity. The best way to prove
that an equation is an identity is to use
192:36 - algebra, and to use other identities, like
the Pythagorean identity, to rewrite one side
192:46 - of the equation, till it looks like the other
side. The best way to prove the net equation
192:52 - is not an identity is to plug in numbers that
break the identity. That is, make the equation
193:00 - not true. Now, if you're just trying to decide
if an equation is an identity or not, and
193:06 - not worried about proving it, then I recommend
plugging in numbers, or graphing the left
193:12 - and right sides to see if those graphs are
the same. Recall that an identity is an equation
193:19 - that holds for all values of the variable.
This video states and proves three identities
193:25 - called the Pythagorean identities. The first
one is the familiar cosine squared theta plus
193:33 - sine squared theta equals one. The second
one says tan squared theta plus one equals
193:41 - secant squared theta. And the third one goes
cotangent squared theta plus one equals cosecant
193:50 - squared theta. Let's start by proving that
cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta
193:56 - equals one. I'll do this by drawing the unit
circle with a right triangle inside it by
194:04 - the definition of sine and cosine, the x&y
coordinates of this top point r cosine theta
194:12 - and sine theta, the high partners of my triangle
is one, since that's the radius of my unit
194:18 - circle. Now the length of the base of my triangle
is the same thing as the x coordinate of this
194:28 - point. So that's equal to cosine theta. The
height of this triangle is the same thing
194:37 - as the y coordinate of this point. So that's
sine theta. Now the Pythagorean theorem for
194:45 - right triangles says this side length squared
plus that sine squared is equal to the hypothenar
194:52 - squared. So by the Pythagorean theorem, we
have that cosine theta square plus sine theta
195:02 - squared equals one squared, I can rewrite
that as cosine squared theta plus sine squared
195:09 - theta equals one, since one squared is one,
and cosine squared theta is just a shorthand
195:15 - notation for cosine theta squared. That completes
the proof of the first Pythagorean identity,
195:23 - at least in the case when the angle theta
is in the first quadrant. In the case, when
195:28 - the angle was in a different quadrant, you
can use symmetry to argue the same identity
195:34 - holds. But I won't give the details here.
To prove the next Pythagorean identity, tan
195:40 - squared theta plus one equals secant squared
theta, let's use the first without your an
195:45 - identity, which said that cosine squared theta
plus sine squared theta equals one, I'm going
195:53 - to divide both sides of this equation by cosine
squared theta. Now I'm going to rewrite the
196:01 - left side by breaking apart the fraction into
cosine squared theta over cosine squared theta
196:08 - plus sine squared theta over cosine squared
theta. Now cosine squared theta over cosine
196:15 - squared theta is just one. And I can rewrite
the next fraction as sine of theta over cosine
196:23 - of theta squared. That's because when I square
a fraction, I can just square the numerator
196:31 - and square the denominator. And sine squared
theta is shorthand for a sine of theta squared.
196:36 - Similarly, for cosine squared theta. Now on
the other side of the equal sign, I can rewrite
196:43 - this fraction as one over cosine theta squared.
Again, that's because when I square the fraction,
196:50 - I just get the one squared, which is one divided
by the cosine theta squared, which is this.
196:59 - I'm almost done. sine theta over cosine theta
is the same thing as tangent theta. And one
197:06 - over cosine theta is the same thing as secant
theta. Using the shorthand notation, that
197:14 - says one plus tan squared theta equals sequencer
data, which, after rearranging is exactly
197:25 - the identity that we were looking for. The
proof of the third for that green identity
197:31 - is very similar. Once again, I'll start with
the identity cosine squared theta plus sine
197:37 - squared theta equals one. And this time, I'll
divide both sides by sine squared theta. I'll
197:44 - break up the fraction on the left. And now
I'll rewrite my fractions as cosine theta
197:51 - over sine theta squared plus one equals one
over sine theta squared. Cosine over sign
198:01 - can be written as cotangent. And one over
sine can be written as cosecant. That gives
198:13 - me the identity that I'm looking for. We've
now proved three trig identities. The first
198:20 - one, we proved using the unit circle and the
Pythagorean Theorem. The second and third
198:31 - identities, we proved by using the first identity
and a bit of algebra. The sum and difference
198:38 - formulas are formulas for computing the sine
of a sum of two angles, the cosine of a sum
198:46 - of two angles, the sine of a difference of
two angles, and the cosine of a difference
198:52 - of two angles. Please pause the video for
a moment to think about this question. Is
198:58 - it true that the sine of A plus B is equal
to the sine of A plus the sine of B? No, it's
199:08 - not true. And we can see by an example, if
we plug in say, A equals pi over two and B
199:16 - equals pi, then the sine of pi over two plus
pi is the same thing as a sine of three pi
199:24 - over two, which is negative one. Whereas the
sine of pi over two plus the sine of pi is
199:32 - equal to one plus zero, which is one, negative
one is not equal to one. So this equation
199:40 - does not hold for all values of a and b. There
are a few values of a and b for which it does
199:46 - hold. For example, if a is zero and B zero,
but it's not true in general. Instead, we
199:54 - need more complicated formulas. It turns out
that the sine of the sum of two ends angles
200:00 - A plus B is given by sine of A cosine of B
plus cosine of A, sine of B. The cosine of
200:12 - A plus B is given by cosine A, cosine B minus
sine A sine Bay. I like to remember these
200:23 - with a song, sine cosine cosine sine cosine
cosine minus sine sine. Please feel free to
200:31 - back up the video and sing along with me,
I encourage you to memorize the two formulas
200:37 - for the sine of a sum of angles and the cosine
of a sum of angles. Once you do, it's easy
200:42 - to figure out the sine and cosine of a difference
of two angles. One way to do this is to think
200:48 - of sine of A minus B as sine of A plus negative
B. And then use the angle sum formula. So
200:59 - this works out two, sine cosine plus cosine,
sine. And now, if I use the fact that cosine
201:12 - is even, I know that cosine of negative B
is cosine of B. And since sine is odd, sine
201:20 - of negative b is negative sine of B. So I
can rewrite this as sine of A cosine of B
201:31 - minus cosine of A sine of B. Notice that this
new formula for the difference is the same
201:39 - as the formula for the sum is just that plus
sign turned into a minus sign, we can do the
201:45 - same trick for cosine of A minus B, that's
cosine of A plus minus b, which is cosine
201:54 - A cosine minus b minus sine of A sine of negative
B. Again, using even an odd properties, this
202:05 - gives us cosine A cosine B plus sine A sine
B. Once again, the formula for the difference
202:15 - is almost exactly like the for the sum, just
that minus sign has switched to a plus sign.
202:21 - Now let's use the angle sum formula to find
the exact value for the sine of 105 degrees.
202:28 - Now, 105 degrees is not a special angle on
the unit circle, but I can write it as the
202:34 - sum of two special angles, I can write it
as 60 degrees plus 45 degrees. Therefore,
202:42 - the sine of 105 degrees is the sine of 60
plus 45. And now by the angle sum formula,
202:52 - this is sine, cosine, cosine, sine. And I,
from my unit circle, I can figure out that
203:04 - sine of 60 degrees is root three over two
cosine of 45 degrees root two over two, cosine
203:11 - of 60 degrees is one half, and sine of 45
degrees is root two over two. So this simplifies
203:18 - to root six plus root two over four. For our
last example, let's find the cosine of v plus
203:29 - W, given the values of cosine v, and cosine
W, and the fact that v and w are angles in
203:35 - the first quadrant. Remember, to compute the
cosine of a sum, we can't just add together
203:42 - the two cosines. That wouldn't even make sense
in this case, because adding point nine and
203:46 - point seven would give something bigger than
one and the cosine of something's never bigger
203:50 - than one. Instead, we have to use the angle
sum formula for cosine. So that goes cosine
203:57 - of v plus w equals cosine, cosine, minus sine,
sine. Now, I've already know the cosine of
204:09 - v and the cosine of W. So I could just plug
those in. But I have to figure out the sine
204:13 - of v and the sine of W from the given information.
And one way to do that is to draw right triangles.
204:20 - So here, I'm going to draw a right triangle
with angle V, and another right triangle with
204:28 - angle W. Since I know that the cosine of V
is point nine, I can think of that as nine
204:38 - over 10. And I can think of that as adjacent
over hypotenuse in my right triangle. So I'll
204:45 - decorate my triangles adjacent side with the
number nine and the hypotony is with 10. Similarly,
204:51 - since I know that the cosine of W is point
seven, which is seven tenths, I can put a
204:56 - seven on this adjacent side and attend on
this side. partners'. Now the Pythagorean
205:03 - Theorem, lets me compute the length of the
unlabeled side. So this one is going to be
205:09 - the square root of 10 squared minus nine squared,
that's going to be the square root of 19.
205:16 - And here I have the square root of 10 squared
minus seven squared. So that's the square
205:20 - root of 51. I can now find the sine of V as
the opposite over the hypotenuse. So that's
205:29 - the square root of 19 over 10. And the sine
of W will be the square root of 51 over 10.
205:39 - Because we're assuming v and w are in the
first quadrant, we know the values of sign
205:43 - need to be positive, so we don't need to Jimmy
around with positive or negative signs in
205:48 - our answers, we can just leave them as is.
Now we're ready to plug into our formula.
205:56 - So we have that cosine of v plus w is equal
to point nine times point seven minus the
206:04 - square root of 19 over 10, times the square
root of 51 over 10. using a calculator, this
206:12 - works out to a decimal approximation of 0.3187.
This video gave the angle sum and difference
206:22 - formulas and use them to compute some values.
To see a proof for why the sum formulas hold,
206:30 - please watch my other video. Remember the
angle some formulas, those are the formulas
206:36 - for computing sine of A plus B, and cosine
of A plus B. I like to sing them, sine cosine,
206:48 - cosine, sine, cosine, cosine minus sine sine.
This video gives a geometric proof of those
207:02 - formulas. There are many great proofs of the
angle some formulas, but I'd like to share
207:08 - with you one of my favorites for those who
are interested. Alright, the angle some formulas
207:13 - up here, so we'll know what we're trying to
prove. To prove these formulas, let me start
207:18 - by drawing an angle A and angle B on top of
that. Next, I'm going to draw a line perpendicular
207:32 - to this middle line. And I'm going to extend
the top line until it meets that perpendicular,
207:37 - making a right triangle. Finally, I'll draw
a rectangle around that right triangle that
207:45 - just touches its vertices. My rectangle is
now divided up into four right triangles.
207:52 - And I'm going to choose units of measurement,
so that the high partners of my middle triangle
207:57 - has length one. Now let's stop for a minute
to think about the angles of these other triangles.
208:06 - Since the top and the bottom edge of the rectangle
are parallel lines, and this hypothenar is
208:13 - is a transversal. This angle up here must
have the same measure as a plus b down here.
208:22 - Also, this skinny angle here must have the
same measure as a down here because this angle
208:32 - is 180 degrees, minus 90 degrees minus this
angle here. And this angle A is also 180 degrees,
208:41 - the measure of the angles in a triangle minus
90 degrees minus that same angle. So I'll
208:48 - label this skinny angle with a. Next, let's
figure out as many side length as we can.
208:56 - Based on the middle right triangle with high
partners one, we know that this side length
209:02 - down here must be cosine of B, since adjacent
over hypotenuse is cosine B. Similarly, this
209:12 - side length here must be sine of B. Since
opposite over hypotenuse is sine of B. Now
209:22 - we see that sine of B is the hypotenuse of
this right triangle, which means that this
209:30 - little side here has measure sign a time sign
B. That's because the opposite over the hypotenuse
209:43 - of this angle has to equal sign a. A similar
argument shows that this side has to have
209:50 - measure cosine A time sign B. Please pause
the video and take a moment to fill in the
209:57 - side length of this right triangle. In this
right triangle, you should be getting sine
210:06 - A cosine B cosine A cosine B, sine of A plus
B and cosine of A plus B. But remember, we
210:26 - have a rectangle here. So the opposite sides
have equal length. This tells us that sine
210:35 - of A plus B has to equal sine of A cosine
of B plus cosine of A sine of B, which is
210:42 - exactly the first angle sum formula. Also,
cosine of A plus B, which is this side length,
210:51 - is exactly the difference of this side length
cosine A cosine B minus this side length,
210:58 - sine of A sine B. And that's the second angle
sum formula. So I think that's a pretty great
211:05 - geometric proof of the angle some formulas.
This video gives formulas for a sine of two
211:13 - theta and cosine of two theta. Please pause
the video for a moment and see if you think
211:20 - this equation sine of two theta equals two
sine theta is true or false. Remember that
211:25 - true means always true for all values of theta,
were false means sometimes they're always
211:32 - false. This equation is false, because it's
not true for all values of theta. One way
211:39 - to see this is graphically, if I graph y equals
sine of two theta, that's like the graph of
211:48 - sine theta, squished in horizontally by a
factor of one half. On the other hand, if
211:55 - I graph y equals two sine theta, that's like
the graph of sine theta stretched vertically
212:02 - by a factor of two. These two graphs are not
the same. So instead, we need a more complicated
212:10 - formula for sine of two theta. And that formula
is sine of two theta is two sine theta, cosine
212:21 - theta. It's not hard to see why that formula
works based on the angle song formula. Recall
212:28 - that sine of A plus B is equal to sine A,
cosine B plus cosine A, sine B. Therefore,
212:40 - sine of two theta, which is sine of theta
plus theta is going to be sine theta, cosine
212:47 - theta, plus cosine theta sine theta. simply
plugging in theta for a and theta for B, in
212:56 - this angle, some formula. Well, sine theta
cosine theta is the same thing as cosine theta
213:02 - sine theta. So I can rewrite this as twice
sine theta cosine theta. That gives me this
213:15 - formula. There's also a formula for cosine
of two theta. And that formula is cosine squared
213:21 - theta minus sine squared theta. Again, we
can use the angle sum formula to see where
213:30 - this comes from. cosine of A plus B is equal
to cosine of A cosine A B minus sine A, sine
213:39 - B. So if we want cosine of two theta, that's
just cosine of theta plus theta, which is
213:46 - cosine theta cosine theta, minus sine theta
sine theta by plugging in beta for A and B.
213:58 - This can be rewritten as cosine squared theta
minus sine squared theta, which is exactly
214:03 - the formula above. Now there are a couple
other formulas for cosine of two theta that
214:09 - are also popular. One of them is one minus
two sine squared theta. And the other one
214:17 - is cosine of two theta is two cosine squared
theta minus one. You can get each of these
214:25 - two formulas from the original one using the
Pythagorean identity. We know that cosine
214:33 - squared theta plus sine squared theta is one.
So cosine squared theta is one minus sine
214:40 - squared theta. If I plug that into my original
formula, which I've copied here, so I'm plugging
214:48 - in instead of cosine squared, I'm going to
write one minus sine squared theta, I still
214:55 - have a nother minus sine squared theta. So
that's the same thing as one minus Twice science
215:01 - grade data, which is exactly what I'm looking
for. Similarly, I can use the Pythagorean
215:08 - identity to write sine squared theta as one
minus cosine squared theta. Again, I'll take
215:16 - this equation and copy it below. But this
time, I'm going to plug in for sine squared
215:24 - right here. So that gives me cosine of two
theta is cosine squared theta minus the quantity
215:32 - one minus cosine squared theta. That simplifies
to two cosine squared theta minus one after
215:40 - distributing the negative sign, and combining
like terms. So I have one double angle formula
215:47 - for sine of two theta. And I have three versions
of the double angle formula for cosine of
215:52 - two theta. Now let's use these formulas in
some examples. Let's find the cosine of two
215:58 - theta. If we know that cosine theta is negative
one over root 10, and theta terminates in
216:04 - quadrant three, we have a choice of three
formulas for cosine of two theta, I'm going
216:12 - to choose the second one, because it only
involves cosine of theta on the right side.
216:16 - And I already know my value for cosine theta.
Of course, I could use one of the other ones,
216:22 - but then I'd have to work out the value of
sine theta. So plugging in, I get cosine of
216:29 - two theta is twice negative one over root
n squared minus one, which simplifies to two
216:37 - tenths minus one or negative eight tenths,
negative four fifths. Finally, let's solve
216:45 - the equation two cosine x plus sine of 2x
equals zero. What makes this equation tricky
216:52 - is that one of the trig functions has the
argument of just x, but the other trig function
216:57 - has the argument of 2x. So I want to use my
double angle formula to rewrite sine of 2x.
217:04 - I'll copy down the two cosine x, and now sine
of 2x is equal to two sine x cosine x. At
217:14 - this point, I see a way to factor my equation,
I can factor out a two cosine x from both
217:22 - of these two terms. That gives me one plus
sine x and the product there is equal to zero.
217:34 - That means that either two cosine x is equal
to zero, or one plus sine x is equal to zero.
217:42 - That simplifies two cosine x equals zero,
or sine x is negative one. Using my unit circle,
217:50 - I see that cosine of x is zero at pi over
two, and three pi over two, while sine of
218:00 - x is negative one at three pi over two, there's
some redundancy here, but my solution set
218:07 - is going to be pi over two plus multiples
of two pi, and three pi over two plus multiples
218:16 - of two pi. This video proved the double angle
formulas, sine of two theta is two sine theta
218:23 - cosine theta. and cosine of two theta is cosine
squared theta minus sine squared theta. It
218:32 - also proved two alternate versions of the
equation for cosine of two theta. This video
218:40 - is about the half angle formulas for computing
cosine of theta over two and sine of theta
218:47 - over two. Cosine of theta over two is either
a plus or minus the square root of one plus
218:57 - cosine theta over two. To figure out whether
to use plus or minus, you need to know something
219:04 - about what quadrant, the angle theta over
two is, if you're expecting cosine theta over
219:09 - two to be negative, then you're gonna need
the negative sign, you're expecting this cosine
219:14 - to be positive, then of course, you want the
positive sign since the square root of something
219:18 - is always positive. Notice that this formula
always makes sense, because the inside of
219:24 - the square root sign is always going to be
positive or zero. Since cosine theta can't
219:29 - be any more negative than negative one, we
have a similar formula for sine of theta over
219:35 - two, and that's plus or minus the square root
of one minus cosine theta over two. Notice
219:43 - that the formulas for both cosine of A half
angle and sine of A half angle both have cosine
219:50 - in them, they just differ by the positive
or negative side and the inside of the square
219:55 - root. To see why these formulas hold, let's
recall the form In the last four double angles,
220:02 - we know that cosine of 2x is equal to two
cosine squared x minus one, or we can write
220:10 - cosine of 2x as one minus two, sine squared
of x. Of course, of course, we can also write
220:18 - cosine of 2x as cosine squared x minus sine
squared x. But this one won't be relevant
220:26 - to our discussion right now. So I'm going
to start with this first formula. And I'm
220:32 - going to make the substitution theta equals
to x, that allows me to write cosine theta
220:40 - is two cosine squared theta over two minus
one. Since if theta is 2x, then x is theta
220:48 - over two. Now, I'm going to solve for cosine
of theta over two. So I'll add one to both
220:58 - sides. Divide both sides by two 
and take the square root of both sides. That
221:11 - gives me that cosine of theta over two is
going to be plus or minus the square root
221:17 - of cosine theta plus one over two, which is
the formula we're looking for. I can carry
221:22 - a similar process out with the second formula.
I'll substitute theta for 2x, which means
221:29 - that x is theta over two, that gives me cosine
theta is one minus two sine squared theta
221:36 - over two. Now I'll solve for sine of theta
over two. I'll start by adding two sine squared
221:46 - theta over two to both sides. Next, I'll subtract
cosine theta from both sides. Next, I'll divide
221:56 - both sides by two. And finally, I'll take
the square root of both sides. That gives
222:02 - me sine of theta over two is plus or minus
the square root of one minus cosine theta
222:09 - over two, which is the formula I was looking
for. Now that we've got our formulas, and
222:15 - know where they come from, let's use them
in an example. Let's suppose that sine theta
222:21 - is four fifths, and theta is between pi over
two and pi. That means it's in the second
222:27 - quadrant, we want to find the exact values
of cosine theta over two and sine theta over
222:34 - two. Since theta is between pi over two and
pi, theta over two will be between pi over
222:41 - four and pi over two. So theta over two is
somewhere in the first quadrant. That means
222:51 - that cosine theta over two and sine theta
over two will both be positive. Let me write
222:57 - down my half angle formulas. And I know I
can ignore the negative version and just use
223:03 - the positive version. Now unfortunately, I'm
just given the value of sine theta and not
223:08 - cosine theta, so I can't plug in directly,
first, I have to use this value to figure
223:12 - out what cosine might be. I'll draw a right
triangle with angle theta. And since sine
223:21 - of theta is four fifths, I'll decorate the
triangle with a four and a five on the hypothesis.
223:28 - That means that this side length is going
to be five squared square root of five squared
223:32 - minus four squared, which is the square root
of nine, which is three. That means that cosine
223:40 - theta is going to be either plus or minus
three fifths because it's adjacent over hypotenuse.
223:50 - Now since I'm in the angle, the second quadrant
for my angle theta, cosine is actually going
223:55 - to be negative three fifths. Now I can plug
into my formulas, I get that cosine of theta
224:03 - over two is going to be the square root of
one minus three fifths over two. That simplifies
224:10 - to the square root of two fifths divided by
two, which is the square root of 1/5, or one
224:15 - over the square root of five. Sine of theta
over two is the square root of one minus cosine
224:24 - theta, so that's one minus negative three
fifths over two, that's the square root of
224:33 - one plus three fifths, or eight fifths over
to the square root of four fifths or two over
224:39 - the square root of five. In this video, we
found formulas for the cosine of A half angle,
224:46 - and the sine of A half angle and use them
in an example. solving a right triangle means
224:53 - finding the lengths of all the sides and the
measures of the angles given partial information.
225:02 - In this example, we're given the length of
one side, and the measure of one angle. Plus
225:08 - we know the measure of this right angle is
90 degrees, we need to find the measure of
225:14 - the third angle labeled capital A, and the
length of the two sides labeled lowercase
225:20 - b and lowercase C. To find the measure of
angle A, let's use the fact that the measures
225:27 - of the three angles of a triangle add up to
180 degrees. So that means that 49 degrees
225:34 - plus 90 degrees plus a is equal to 180 degrees.
So A is equal to 180 degrees minus 90 degrees
225:45 - minus 49 degrees, which works out to 41 degrees.
To find the length of the side B, we have
225:53 - a couple of possible options. We could use
the fact that tan of 49 degrees, which is
226:01 - opposite over adjacent is B over 23. So b
is 23 times tan 49 degrees, which works out
226:12 - to 26.46 units. Alternatively, we could use
the fact that tan of 41 degrees is 23 over
226:23 - b since now if we're looking at the angle
here, 23 is our opposite and B is an adjacent,
226:31 - that's a little bit harder to solve algebraically.
But we can write B tan 41 degrees equals 23,
226:38 - which means that B is 23 divided by 1041 degrees
with a calculator that works out again to
226:47 - 26.46. The reason we want to use tan in this
problem and not say sine or cosine is because
226:54 - tan of say 49 degrees relates the unknown
side that we're looking for B to the side
227:01 - that we know the measure of if we had use
sine instead, we'll be saying that sine of
227:07 - 49 is B over C and we'd have two unknowns,
which would make it difficult to solve. Next,
227:15 - to find the side length C, we can have a few
options, we could use a trig function again.
227:21 - For example, we could use the cosine of 49
degrees, that's adjacent over hypotenuse,
227:31 - which is 23 oversee. Solving for C, we get
that C is 23 over cosine 49. Which works out
227:43 - to 35.06 units. Another option would be to
use the Pythagorean Theorem to find C. Since
227:53 - we know 23 squared plus b squared equals c
squared. In other words, that's 23 squared
228:00 - plus 26.46 squared equals c squared, which
means that C is the square root of that song,
228:11 - which works out again to 35.06. To review
the ideas we used where the sum of the angles
228:22 - is equal to 180 degrees. We used facts like
tangent of an angle being opposite over adjacent
228:30 - and similar facts about sine and cosine. And
we use the Pythagorean Theorem. This allowed
228:36 - us to find all the angles and side lengths
of the triangle knowing just the side length
228:41 - of one side and the angle of one of the non
right angles to begin with. In this next example,
228:51 - we don't know any of the angles except for
the right angle, but we know to have the side
228:56 - lengths. To find the unknown angle theta,
we can use the fact that cosine theta is adjacent
229:03 - overhype hotness, so that's 10 over 15. Cosine
is a good trig function to use here, because
229:11 - this equation relates our unknown angle to
our two known sides. So we just have one unknown
229:18 - in our equation to solve for. To solve for
theta, we just take the cosine inverse of
229:24 - 10/15 which is 0.8411 radians, or 48.19 degrees.
To find the measure of angle fee, we could
229:40 - use the fact that sine of fee is 10 over 15
and take sine inverse of 10/15. But probably
229:46 - a little easier just to use the fact that
these three angles do 180 degrees. That tells
229:52 - us that fee plus 90 plus 48.19 is equal to
180 Which means that fee is 41.81. Finally,
230:09 - we can find x, either using a trig function
or by using the Pythagorean Theorem. To find
230:16 - it using a trig function, we could write down
something like tan of 48.19 degrees is x over
230:24 - 10. To find that using the Tyrion theorem,
we'd write down 10 squared plus x squared
230:29 - equals 15 squared. I'll use the Pythagorean
theorem and find the x by doing the square
230:36 - root of 15 squared minus 10 squared. That
gives me an answer of 11.18. Notice that we
230:45 - use many of the same ideas as in the previous
problem. For example, the fact that the sum
230:50 - of the angles is 180. The Pythagorean theorem
and the trig functions like tan, sine and
230:59 - cosine, we also use the inverse trig functions
to get from an equation like this one to the
231:06 - angle. This video showed how it's possible
to find the lengths of all the sides of a
231:11 - right triangle. And then measures of all the
angles given partial information. For example,
231:17 - the measure of one angle and one side or from
two sides. Recall that solving a triangle
231:27 - means finding all the lengths of the sides
and all the measures of the angles from partial
231:33 - information. The Law of Cosines is a tool
that can help us solve triangles that are
231:39 - not necessarily right triangles. Recall that
the Pythagorean theorem says that for a right
231:46 - triangle, like this one, the length of the
hypothesis is related to the lengths of the
231:53 - sides by the formula c squared equals a squared
plus b squared. I like to think of the law
232:00 - of cosines. As a generalization of the Pythagorean
Theorem, two triangles that are not necessarily
232:06 - right triangles. loosely speaking, the Law
of Cosines says that c squared is equal to
232:13 - a squared plus b squared plus a correction
factor where the correction factor depends
232:20 - on the size of the angle, that's opposite
to side C. For this first triangle, on the
232:29 - left, the angle that's opposite to side C
is exactly a right angle. So we know that
232:36 - c squared is exactly equal to a squared plus
b squared. But in this next triangle, the
232:45 - angle opposite decides C prime is a little
bit less than a right angle. So we expect
232:52 - the side length C prime should be a little
bit shorter than the side length C in the
232:57 - previous triangle that had the same side length
A and B for its legs. Therefore, C prime squared
233:05 - should be less than a squared plus b squared,
or in other words, C prime squared should
233:11 - equal a squared plus b squared minus a little
bit. In this third triangle, the angle opposite
233:19 - C double prime is a little bigger than 90
degrees. So this side length C double prime
233:25 - should be a little bit longer than the side
length C in the right triangle with the same
233:30 - size legs. So C double prime squared should
be bigger than a squared plus b squared, we
233:39 - can write this as C double prime squared is
equal to a squared plus b squared plus a little
233:45 - bit. The Law of Cosines says precisely what
this little correction factor is. It says
233:52 - that for any triangle with sides, a B and
C, and angle capital C, opposite side C, side
234:00 - c squared is equal to a squared plus b squared
minus two A B, cosine angle C. Let's analyze
234:11 - what happens with this equation when angle
C is equal to 90 degrees less than 90 degrees
234:17 - and greater than 90 degrees. If angle C is
equal to 90 degrees, then cosine of angle
234:26 - C is equal to zero. So we have that c squared
is equal to a squared plus b squared, the
234:32 - ordinary Pythagorean Theorem. If on the other
hand, angle C is less than 90 degrees, then
234:39 - from the unit circle, we know that cosine
of C is positive. So to a B, cosine C is a
234:48 - positive number, and we'll be subtracting
a little bit from our A squared plus B squared,
234:54 - just like we saw in the picture. Finally,
if angle C is bigger than 90 degrees, then
235:01 - we can see from the unit circle that cosine
FC is negative. So to a B, cosine capital
235:09 - C is going to be less than zero. And we're
going to be subtracting a negative number,
235:15 - which means we're actually adding a little
bit, just like we saw in the third picture.
235:21 - When labeling a triangle, the convention is
to use capital letters for the angles and
235:27 - lowercase letters for the side lengths. And
to put side A opposite angle A, and so on.
235:34 - When we wrote the law of cosines, on the previous
page, we wrote c squared equals a squared
235:40 - plus b squared minus two A B, cosine angle
C. But it doesn't matter which side we call
235:48 - a, which side we call B, and which side we
call C. All that matters is that this angle
235:53 - is opposite to the side and between these
two sides. So we could have just as easily
236:00 - written a squared is equal to b squared plus
c squared minus two B, C, cosine A. all we've
236:09 - done is replace C with A, A with B, and B
with C and our labeling scheme. Or instead,
236:21 - we could put the B squared on the left side
and right b squared equals a squared plus
236:26 - c squared minus two a C, cosine B, we can
use whichever of these three forms is most
236:33 - convenient for the problem at hand. Let's
use the law of cosines. To find all the side
236:39 - lengths and angles in this triangle. By convention,
I'll call the side opposite to angle A little
236:46 - a and the side opposite angle B, little B.
Notice that we know two side lengths and the
236:58 - angle between them. So that's an S, a s, side
angle side triangle. If we write down the
237:07 - law of cosines, with the unknown side, c squared
on the left side, then we have all the values
237:15 - for the variables on the right side. So let's
plug them in. I'll use a calculator in degree
237:21 - mode to find that c squared is equal to 44.44.
taking the square root, I get that c is equal
237:30 - to 6.67. Next, I'll use the law of cosines.
To find the angle B, I'll need to use a version
237:39 - of the Law of Cosines that has cosine be right
here. That's the version that has little b
237:46 - squared on the left side and goes b squared
equals a squared plus c squared minus two
237:54 - a C, cosine B. I can plug in values for all
my side lengths. And now I can solve for cosine
238:04 - B. To do that, I'll subtract eight squared
and 6.67 squared from both sides. And now
238:12 - I'll divide both sides by negative two times
eight times 6.67. using a calculator, this
238:19 - gives me that cosine of B is equal to negative
0.1172. The negative value of cosine indicates
238:29 - that my angle B must be greater than 90 degrees,
which agrees with the figure. Next, I can
238:37 - take cosine inverse of both sides to get that
b is equal to cosine inverse negative 0.1172,
238:46 - which works out to 96.73 degrees. The last
thing I need to do is solve for angle A, I
238:55 - could use the Law of Cosines again, and work
out angle A just like I worked out angle B
239:00 - here. But a simpler thing to do is to use
the fact that the sum of the three angles
239:06 - equals 180 degrees. In other words, a plus
37 degrees plus 96.73 degrees equals 180 degrees.
239:17 - So A is going to be 180 minus 37 minus 96.73,
which works out to 46.27 degrees. In the previous
239:31 - example, we were given two sides, and the
angle between them. In this example, instead,
239:37 - we're given three side lengths. So I'll call
this and s, s, s, side side side triangle,
239:46 - we need to find all three angles. Although
there are a lot of computations involved,
239:51 - the ideas are the same as in the previous
problem. Defined angle capital C, we need
239:58 - the form of the Law of Cosines That has cosine
of C on the right side, and little C on the
240:05 - left side. To find angle A, we need the form
of the Law of Cosines that has cosine A on
240:13 - the right side and little a on the left side.
And to find angle B, we need the form of the
240:19 - Law of Cosines that has cosine of B on the
right side, and little b squared on the left
240:27 - side. For each of these three equations, I'll
plug in the side lengths. So for the cosines
240:36 - and use inverse cosine to find my angles.
Notice that my three angles 60 degrees, 32
240:44 - point 20 degrees, and 87.79 degrees add up
to just almost 180 degrees, the difference
240:53 - is just around off error. In fact, I could
have saved myself some work by just finding
240:59 - the measure of angle C, and the measure of
angle A, and then subtracting them from 180
241:04 - degrees to get the measure of angle B. In
this video, we stated the law of cosines and
241:12 - used it to solve some triangles. The Law of
Cosines can be thought of as the Pythagorean
241:18 - Theorem, with the correction factor to account
for triangles that aren't right triangles.
241:24 - Recall that solving a right triangle means
finding all the lengths of the sides and all
241:30 - the measures of the angles from partial information.
The Law of Cosines is a tool that can help
241:36 - us solve triangles that are not necessarily
right triangles. We call it the Pythagorean
241:42 - theorem says that for a right triangle, like
this one, c squared is equal to a squared
241:51 - plus b squared. I like to think of the law
of cosines. As a generalization of the Pythagorean
241:57 - Theorem, two triangles that are not necessarily
right triangles. loosely speaking, the Law
242:03 - of Cosines says that c squared is equal to
a squared plus b squared plus a correction
242:11 - factor where the correction factor depends
on the size of the angle that's opposite sides
242:18 - see, in this first triangle, on the left,
the angle opposite to side C is a right angle.
242:25 - So we know that c squared is equal to exactly
a squared plus b squared. But on the next
242:34 - triangle, the angle opposite to side C prime
is a little bit less than a right angle. So
242:42 - this side, C prime should be a little shorter
than a squared plus b squared. All right,
242:49 - C prime squared is equal to a squared plus
b squared minus a bit. In this third triangle,
243:00 - says the angle opposite to side C double prime
is a little bit bigger than 90 degrees, this
243:07 - side length should be a little bit bigger
than a squared plus b squared. So I'll write
243:12 - it as a squared plus b squared plus a little
bit. The Law of Cosines says exactly what
243:19 - this little correction factor is. It says
that for any triangle with sides, A, B and
243:24 - C and angle capital C are opposite to side
C. C squared is equal to a squared plus b
243:31 - squared minus two A B, cosine of angle C.
No notice that if the angle C is less than
243:41 - 90 degrees, cosine of C is going to be a positive
number. And so we'll be subtracting a positive
243:51 - quantity, just like we saw in the picture
above. If however, angle C is bigger than
243:58 - 90 degrees, then cosine of c is negative.
So by subtracting to a B, cosine C, we're
244:06 - actually adding a little bit, and we get a
longer side as in this picture. When labeling
244:13 - a triangle, the convention is to use lowercase
letters for the side lengths and uppercase
244:19 - letters for the angles, and to put angle A
opposite side A, and so on. When we wrote
244:26 - the law of cosines, on the previous page,
we wrote c squared equals a squared plus b
244:31 - squared minus two A B, cosine C. But it doesn't
matter which side we call a, which side we
244:40 - call B, and which side the coffee. All that
matters is that this angle is opposite to
244:46 - this side, and between these two sides, so
we could have just as easily written a squared
244:54 - equals b squared plus c squared minus two
B, C code sine A or B squared equals a squared
245:05 - plus c squared minus two a C, cosine B, we
can use whichever of these three forms is
245:13 - most convenient for the problem at hand. Let's
use the law of cosines. To find the side length
245:20 - the angles of this triangle, by convention,
I'm going to call the side opposite angle
245:26 - B, side, little B, and the side opposite angle
A side, little a. Since we know two side lengths,
245:38 - and the angle between them, we have all the
information on the right side of the law of
245:43 - cosines. So I'll plug that in. And use a calculator
in degree mode to find that c squared equals
245:52 - 44.44. taking the square root, I get that
C equals 6.67. Next, I'll use the law of cosines.
246:05 - To find the angle B, I need to use a version
of the law of cosines. That mentions cosine
246:12 - of angle B here, so it'll need to mention
side length little B here. So that'll be the
246:18 - form b squared. On the left, I'll get a squared
plus c squared minus two a C, cosine B. On
246:29 - the right, I'll plug in values from my side
lengths. And now I can solve for cosine B
246:36 - by subtracting eight squared, and 6.67 squared
from both sides. And now dividing both sides
246:44 - by negative two times eight times 6.67. using
a calculator, this gives me that cosine of
246:51 - B is equal to negative point 1172. The negative
value of cosine indicates that my angle B
247:02 - must be greater than 90 degrees, which agrees
with a picture. Next, I can take cosine inverse
247:08 - of both sides to get that b is equal to cosine
inverse of negative point 1172, which works
247:19 - out to 96.73 degrees. The last thing I have
to do is solve for angle A, I could use the
247:29 - Law of Cosines again, and work it out just
like I did here for angle B. But a simpler
247:35 - method is to just use the fact that the sum
of the three angles is 180 degrees. So a must
247:43 - be 180 degrees minus 37 degrees minus 96.73
degrees. This works out to 46.27 degrees.
247:58 - In the previous example, we were given two
sides and the angle between them. In this
248:03 - angle, were given instead, three side lengths,
and we need to find all three angles. Although
248:09 - there are a lot of computations involved,
the ideas are the same as in the previous
248:14 - problem. To find angle capital C, we need
the form of the law of cosines, that has cosine
248:21 - of capital C on the right side, to find capital
B, we need to use the form of the Law of Cosines
248:27 - that has cosine of B on the right side, and
little B on the left side. So it'll be b squared
248:33 - equals a squared plus c squared minus two
a C cosine B. At the find angle A, we need
248:41 - a little A squared on the left side. So that
will get cosine of angle A on the right side.
248:50 - For each of these three equations, I'll plug
in the side lengths, solve for the cosine
248:56 - of the angle and use inverse cosine to find
my angles. Notice that my three angles 60
249:04 - degrees, 87.79 degrees, and 32 point 20 degrees
add up to almost exactly 180 degrees, it's
249:12 - just a tiny bit off due to roundoff error.
In fact, I could have saved myself some work
249:18 - by just finding the measure of angle C, and
the measure of angle B, for example, and then
249:23 - subtracting their sum from 180 degrees to
get angle A. In this video, we stated the
249:30 - law of cosines and used it to solve some triangles.
The Law of Cosines can be thought of as the
249:37 - Pythagorean Theorem with an adjustment factor
to account for triangles that aren't right
249:42 - triangles. The Law of Sines is a tool that
can be used to solve triangles that are not
249:48 - necessarily right triangles. It's especially
useful when we know two angles and one side
249:54 - and it can also be used in this situation
where we know two sides and an angle Let's
250:00 - not between them. The Law of Sines says that
for a triangle with angles A, B and C, opposite
250:08 - two sides, lowercase a, b, and c respectively.
The sine of angle A divided by the length
250:18 - of side A is equal to the sine of B over B,
which is also equal to the sine of C over
250:26 - C. Notice that we're taking the sine of the
three angles, and dividing by the three opposite
250:34 - side lengths. Suppose we know that angle A
is 55 degrees, angle C is 67 degrees, and
250:43 - Side B is 20 degrees, we want to solve the
triangle, that is find the length of the other
250:50 - sides and the measure of the third angle.
Since we know two angles already, we can find
250:56 - the third angle by subtracting from 180 degrees.
So angle B is 58 degrees. Now I can use the
251:05 - Law of Sines to find my remaining side lengths.
To find side A, I'll use the fact that sine
251:15 - of angle A over side length A is equal to
sine of angle B over side length B. Since
251:23 - I already know three of these quantities,
angle A, angle B, and side length B, I can
251:31 - plug in and solve for the unknown side length
a to solve or multiply both sides by a and
251:39 - then multiply both sides by 20 over the sine
of 58 degrees. That gives me that a is equal
251:46 - to 20 sine 55 oversized 58, which works out
to 19.32. Please pause the video and use the
251:59 - same method to find side length See, this
time, we need to involve sign of C and sidelink
252:09 - see in our equation. And we could use either
the B's or the A's since they're both known
252:16 - for the other side. I'll plug in values as
I can and solve for C. C works out to 21.71.
252:29 - In the previous example, we use the Law of
Sines to find the side lengths of a triangle,
252:35 - because we already knew the angles. In this
next example, we're given some side lengths.
252:41 - And we're going to need to solve for some
angles. This can be tricky, because when we
252:47 - write down the law of sines and start solving
for an angle, we first solve for sine of the
252:55 - angle. But there can be two plausible angles
that both have the same sign. For example,
253:02 - if sine of the angle happens to be one half,
then the angle could be either 30 degrees,
253:12 - or 150 degrees. In some cases, this can lead
to two possible triangles that both have the
253:21 - conditions given When this happens, and there
are two possible solutions. I call this an
253:26 - ambiguous case. With that warning, let's figure
out the details of this example. Plugging
253:33 - in my given information into the law of signs,
I'll focus on this portion of the equation
253:40 - where there's only one unknown to solve for.
First off, solve for sine of A, which is eight
253:47 - times sine 40 degrees over seven, which works
out to 0.7346. From the unit circle, I can
253:59 - see that there'll be two possible angles with
this sine one in the first quadrant and one
254:05 - in the second quadrant. If I take sine inverse
of both sides of my equation, I get the solution
254:13 - in the first quadrant, which is 47.27 degrees.
Since this angle right here is 47.27 degrees,
254:26 - so is this angle here. And so the angle that
I want in the second quadrant I can get by
254:31 - going 180 minus 47.27 degrees, which works
out to 132.731 of these possible angles. It's
254:44 - an acute angle, the other one and obtuse angle,
but both are possible configurations are sketch
254:50 - the possible triangles in both triangles,
side length A and B are the same and angle
254:59 - B is the same But everything else is different.
We can continue to solve for the other angle
255:05 - and side in each case. In the left side, I'll
call this case one, we can solve for angle
255:14 - C, by taking 180 degrees minus angle B minus
angle A. That gives us an angle just over
255:26 - 90 degrees 92.73 degrees. Now we can use either
the Law of Sines or the law of cosines. To
255:33 - find the final side length C, I'll use the
Law of Sines again. So I plug in the value
255:40 - of angle C into this part of my equation,
and solve for C to get C equals sine 92.73
255:50 - degrees times seven over sine 40 degrees,
which works out to 10.88. For the right hand
256:02 - triangle, we can carry out the same steps
to get angle C. And now plug in to the Law
256:08 - of Sines. To get side length to see, we finish
solving for the two possible triangles. With
256:18 - these given side length, and angle. In this
video, we use the Law of Sines to solve a
256:25 - triangle in two different situations. In the
first situation, we had two angles and the
256:30 - side between them. So that's an A s, a triangle,
for angle, side angle. And that situation,
256:41 - we ended up just using the law of science
to solve for side lengths, and there was no
256:47 - ambiguity. In the second situation, we had
a triangle where we knew two side lengths
256:52 - and an angle that was not between them. So
I'll call that s s A. And in that case, we
256:58 - did find two possible triangles. That would
work. The SSA situation doesn't always give
257:06 - two possible triangles. Sometimes when you
go through the two cases, and figure out all
257:12 - the other angles and side lengths, you'll
get an impossible situation. And the angle,
257:17 - for example, that's got to be negative. Because
the other two angles add up to more than 180
257:24 - degrees by but you do have to be on the lookout
for two possible triangles when you're solving
257:30 - a triangle with the SSA information given.
This video describes some of the features
257:36 - of a parabola. Its vertex, focus and directrix.
I want to start by finding the equation of
257:44 - all points that are equidistant the same distance
from a point zero p on the y axis, and the
257:52 - horizontal line y equals negative P. I'm assuming
here that P is positive, for starters, certainly
258:01 - the origin will be among those points as it
has a distance of P from the point and P from
258:08 - the line. But the other points on the x axis
will be closer to the line than they are to
258:14 - the point. So if I want the set of points
that are the same distance from the point
258:18 - of the line, that's going to be a curve that
curved upwards, something like this. So for
258:25 - example, a point out here will be the same
distance from the point as it is from the
258:31 - line. So our intuition is suggesting that
this set of points should be the shape of
258:38 - a parabola. Let's confirm this with some algebra.
If we take an arbitrary point, with coordinates
258:46 - x, y, its distance from the point zero P is
given by the distance formula, x minus zero
258:54 - squared plus y minus p squared. Its distance
from the line y equals negative P is just
259:03 - given by its difference in Y coordinates.
So that's going to be y minus negative p or
259:14 - y plus P. Let me set these two quantities
equal to each other. And simplify, I can square
259:22 - both sides to get on the left x minus zero
squared with the same thing as x squared plus
259:29 - y minus p squared equals y plus p squared.
Now I'll distribute out, that gives me x squared
259:39 - plus y squared minus two p y plus p squared
equals y squared plus two p y plus p squared.
259:49 - The P squares cancel out as do the Y squared,
and I'm left with x squared equals four p
259:58 - y after move In this negative two p y to the
other side, I could also write this as y equals
260:06 - one over four p x squared. And you might recognize
this as the standard parabola y equals x squared,
260:14 - transformed by vertically stretched it stretching
or shrinking it by this factor of whenever
260:20 - for pee. You might recall that this lowest
point of the parabola is called the vertex.
260:26 - This point here is called its focus. And the
line here is called the directrix. Notice
260:36 - that the number of P in this equation represents
the distance between the vertex and the focus,
260:43 - and also represents the distance between the
vertex and the directrix line. For this reason,
260:49 - if you're interested in the focus and the
vertex, this form of the equation might be
260:54 - more useful than the equivalent form something
like y equals A x squared, where the that
261:01 - distance P is more hidden. Now, so far, we've
just considered the case when a p is greater
261:07 - than zero. Let's look for a moment at what
happens when p is less than zero, then when
261:12 - we draw the point zero, P is going to be below
the x axis. And the directrix y equals negative
261:21 - P is going to be above the x axis because
we're taking the negative of a negative number
261:25 - makes it a positive y value. Our parabola
will also be upside down. All the algebra
261:35 - works out the same is just in our equation,
this coefficient of y will now be a negative
261:41 - number instead of a positive one. Or if we
write it in this other form, which might be
261:45 - more familiar, our coefficient of x squared
will be negative instead of positive, which
261:50 - signifies that the parabola is pointing down.
Since P is now a negative number, if we want
261:57 - to talk about distances, we should write absolute
value of p instead of P. Next, let's turn
262:04 - things sideways by looking at the equation
for all points equidistant from a point P
262:10 - zero. on the x axis. Here, we're assuming
For starters, that P is bigger than zero,
262:16 - and a vertical line at x equals negative P.
Our intuition suggests that this should be
262:24 - a parabola pointing sideways. And we can work
out the same algebra steps to get an equation
262:30 - for it. Starting with an arbitrary point,
x y, the distance from the point P zero is
262:40 - going to be given by x minus p squared plus
y minus zero squared, the distance from the
262:46 - line x equals negative P is going to be given
by the difference in x coordinates. So that's
262:54 - going to be x minus negative p, or just x
plus P. I'll set these two distances equal
263:03 - to each other, square both sides like before,
and simplify. This gives me the equation y
263:10 - squared equals four p x, which I could also
rewrite as x equals one over four p y squared
263:18 - or x equals A y squared, where my a corresponds
to my one over four P. Once again, if p is
263:26 - negative, then I probably pointing the opposite
direction, but my equation will still be the
263:33 - same, it'll just have a negative coefficient
of x instead of a positive one. The negative
263:38 - number of being hidden inside this variable
P. As before, the absolute value of p gives
263:46 - me the distance between the vertex and the
focus, and also gives me the distance between
263:53 - the vertex and the directrix. Now let's find
the equation of a parabola with a vertex at
263:59 - some arbitrary point h k instead of the origin,
assuming that the parabola opens up or down.
264:08 - If the parabola had its vertex at the origin,
we know it would be given by the equation
264:13 - x squared equals four p y, or I could rewrite
that as y equals one over four p x squared.
264:22 - So this parabola should just be shifted to
the right by H and up by K. From transformations
264:29 - of functions. We know we can accomplish this
by sticking a x minus h on the inside and
264:39 - putting a plus k on the outside. In other
words, we have y minus k equals one over four
264:47 - P times x minus h squared. Or we can write
this as x minus h squared equals four P times
264:57 - y minus k. So this is the original All with
a vertex at the origin, and here is the transformed
265:08 - by shifting right and up to have a vertex
at h k, notice that the equations are exactly
265:17 - the same. It's just you stuck in a minus h
and a minus k near the X and near the y, this
265:27 - transform parabola will have its focus, a
distance of P up from the vertex. So that's
265:32 - going to be the point h, k plus p, that's
going to have as directrix at a distance p
265:40 - down from the vertex. So that's going to be
the line y equals k minus P. Everything's
265:49 - the same for this other parabola pointing
downwards, we just have P is negative in that
265:55 - case, the same story holds for the parabola
is pointing right and left, the original equation,
266:03 - y squared equals four p x gets transformed
when we shift the parabola over into y minus
266:11 - k squared equals four p x minus h. This time,
the vertex is a distance p to the left or
266:20 - right of my vertex. So here it would be h
plus p, k. And the directrix would be shifted
266:29 - over by P also from the vertex. So this would
be the vertical line x equals h minus P. It
266:37 - works the same way, when the parabola is opening,
left instead of right, it's just in this case,
266:43 - P is negative. Let's use this information
to find the equation of a parabola with vertex
266:50 - at two, four, and focus at negative one, four.
I'll start with a quick sketch, which will
266:55 - help me see how the parabola is lined up.
So here's the vertex at two, four. And the
267:03 - focus is at negative one, four. So here's
the focus here. Now says the problem always
267:11 - has its focus, that means that this problem
must be pointing left and looks something
267:17 - like this. The directrix is going to be on
the other side of the parabola, the same distance
267:23 - as the distance between the vertex and the
focus. Since this distance is a distance of
267:29 - three to minus negative one is three, the
directrix must be three units over here to
267:36 - the right, and so that would be the line x
equals five. Since my problems open to the
267:47 - left, I know I need to use the form of the
equation y minus k squared equals four p x
267:54 - minus h, where h k is the vertex, so that's
two four, I also know that P is going to be
268:01 - negative. And since the absolute value of
p represents the distance between the vertex
268:07 - and the focus, I know that P must be negative
three. So filling on all these numbers, I
268:14 - get y minus four squared equals four times
negative three times x minus two. I'll simplify
268:24 - that to y minus four squared equals negative
12x minus two. In this video, we looked at
268:31 - special forms of the equation for a parabola,
the forms y minus k squared equals four p
268:38 - x minus h, and x minus h squared equals four
p y minus k. In these equations, h k represents
268:47 - the vertex and PS absolute value gives the
distance between the vertex and the focus
269:01 - and between the vertex and the directrix.
parabolas in this form, are opening right
269:10 - if p is bigger than zero, and left if p is
less than zero, and parabolas in this form,
269:17 - are opening up if p is bigger than zero, and
down if p is less than zero. This video is
269:25 - about ellipses. Recall that a circle can be
defined as a set of points whose distance
269:32 - from a fixed point is a constant. And he lips
can be defined as a set of points, such that
269:41 - the sum of the distances from two fixed points
is a constant. The two fixed points are called
269:55 - focuses or foe sigh The sum of the distances
to the to fo Sai is the total length of the
270:05 - string, which is held constant as I draw the
ellipse. Let's examine the features of an
270:10 - ellipse in more detail. In these pictures,
the two black dots are the focuses or fo sigh.
270:19 - The red line segment that cuts through the
middle of the ellipse in the long direction
270:24 - and passes through this low sigh, it's called
the major axis. The line segment that cuts
270:30 - through the middle of the ellipse in the shorter
direction is called the minor axis. And the
270:35 - two points at the tips of the ellipse where
the major axis actually touches the ellipse
270:40 - are called the vertices. And ellipse could
be elongated in any direction, but will only
270:47 - consider ellipses that are elongated either
in the horizontal direction, or the vertical
270:52 - direction. Let's find the equation of an ellipse
whose fo cy are at negative c zero, and c
271:01 - zero, and whose vertices are at negative a
zero and a zero. This will be an ellipse that's
271:11 - elongated in the horizontal direction. For
any point x, y on the ellipse, the sum of
271:19 - the distance from x y to the first focus,
plus its distance to the second focus has
271:25 - to be some constant. And in fact, it turns
out that constant has to equal to a, I'll
271:32 - show you why. If you look at this point right
here on the far right tip of the ellipse,
271:39 - its distance from the first focus is going
to be to C plus a minus C. And as distance
271:49 - from the second focus is just going to be
a minus say, if you add up c plus c plus a
271:55 - minus c plus a minus C, you get exactly to
a. So let me write out my formulas for distances,
272:05 - the distance from a point x y to the first
focus, the point negative c zero is going
272:10 - to be the square root of x minus negative
c squared plus y minus zero squared. And the
272:19 - distance from x y to the second focus, the
point c zero is going to be the square root
272:25 - of x minus c squared plus y minus zero squared.
That Psalm needs to add up to two a, after
272:32 - a fair amount of algebra, this simplifies
the expression a squared minus c squared x
272:40 - squared plus a squared y squared equals a
squared times a squared minus c squared. If
272:48 - we let b squared equals a squared minus c
squared, then we can rewrite this as b squared
272:54 - x squared plus a squared y squared equals
a squared b squared, and dividing both sides
273:01 - by a squared b squared, this gives us the
form of the equation for the ellipse x squared
273:07 - over a squared plus y squared over b squared
equals one. Since we got b squared as a squared
273:15 - minus c squared, it follows that b is less
than a. In fact, B is half the length of the
273:22 - minor axis. In other words, this point right
here is the point zero, B, and this point
273:29 - is the point zero negative B. To see why this
is true, let's draw these two right triangles.
273:37 - The sum of the side lengths that I've drawn
has to be the total length of the string.
273:43 - So that equals to a, which means each of these
side lengths must be a. Now the base of this
273:50 - triangle is C. So by the Pythagorean Theorem,
this height squared must be a squared minus
273:57 - c squared. Since b squared is defined as a
squared minus c squared, this height must
274:03 - be B. To summarize, for a number a bigger
than B, the equation x squared over a squared
274:10 - plus y squared over b squared equals one represents
any lips. That's elongated in the horizontal
274:22 - direction, whose major axis terminates in
the points minus a zero, and a zero, and whose
274:31 - minor access terminates in the points zero
B, and zero minus b. It's fo cy are at the
274:41 - points negative c zero, and c zero. And the
relationship between a B and C is that b squared
274:49 - is a squared minus c squared equivalently.
If we add c squared to both sides, and subtract
274:57 - b squared from both sides, we can write See
squared equals a squared minus b squared.
275:03 - The way I remember this is that the biggest
of the three numbers A, B, and C is definitely
275:07 - going to be a, since a is half the length
of the major axis, which is bigger than half
275:13 - the length of the minor axis, and definitely
bigger than the length between the origin
275:18 - and one of the focuses. Since a is the biggest,
and we have a Pythagorean Theorem relationship
275:24 - between a, b and c, the equation must be b
squared plus c squared equals a squared, which
275:29 - can be rearranged to either of these two equations.
Now what happens instead, if we have a bigger
275:36 - than B still, but this time, we're dividing
y squared by the bigger number squared, and
275:41 - x squared by the smaller number squared? Well,
this basically reverses the roles of x and
275:46 - y in my equation. And so we end up with the
major axis on the y axis stretching between
275:52 - the points, zero a, and zero negative a, whereas
the minor axis is going to be along the x
275:59 - axis going in between negative b zero, and
B zero, and the first side are going to be
276:06 - here on the y axis again. So in this case,
my lives is elongated in the vertical direction.
276:16 - Our previous ellipses were centered at the
origin. What if the ellipse is centered instead
276:21 - of an arbitrary point, HK, well, then we need
to shift everything over by h in the horizontal
276:27 - direction, and K in the vertical direction.
So instead of the equation, x squared over
276:32 - a squared plus y squared over b squared equals
one, we're gonna have to have x minus h squared
276:40 - over a squared plus y minus k squared over
b squared equals one, where A is bigger than
276:47 - B, that's for an ellipse elongated in the
horizontal direction. If we want an ellipse
276:53 - elongated in the vertical direction, we'll
still take a bigger than B, but we'll reverse
276:59 - the roles of x and y. So this becomes x squared
over b squared plus y squared over a squared
277:05 - equals one for the center at the origin. And
to shifted over, we get x minus h squared
277:12 - over b squared plus y minus k squared over
a squared equals one. I'll draw some pictures
277:19 - below. With some thought we can label key
points. For example, this vertex must be shifted
277:25 - over by an amount a, since a is half the length
of the major axis. So it'll have coordinates
277:31 - H plus a, k was this vertex will be h minus
A k. This point up here should be h, k plus
277:41 - b, and this one, h k minus b, the fo cy are
it, H plus c, k, and H minus C. Okay. We can
277:55 - label the points on the ellipse that's elongated
vertically. Similarly, let's write the equation
278:02 - of the ellipse drawn below, and then we'll
find it so cy, its major axis is in the vertical
278:08 - direction, right here. Its top vertex is at
the point four, three, as bottom vertex is
278:16 - at the point for negative nine. Its center
is halfway between its two vertices, which
278:24 - is right here, at the point four, negative
three. Finally, I can read off the points
278:31 - at the end of the minor axis. So this one
is at nine, negative three, and this one is
278:38 - at negative one, negative three. Since my
lips is elongated vertically, I know I have
278:44 - an equation of the form x minus h squared
over b squared plus y minus k squared over
278:50 - a squared equals one with a bigger than be
my center is my point h k. And that's equal
278:58 - to four negative three, a is half the length
of the major axis. So that's the vertical
279:05 - distance between this point and this point,
I can just take the difference of Y coordinates
279:10 - and see that a is equal to six. B is half
the length of a minor axis. So looking at
279:17 - the difference in x coordinates of these two
points, I see that b is equal to five. Throwing
279:24 - that all into my equation, I get that x minus
four squared over five squared plus y plus
279:32 - three squared over six squared equals one,
the fo cy are going to be somewhere along
279:38 - the major axis somewhere above and below the
center. To figure out how far they are, I
279:45 - need to use the fact that c squared is equal
to a squared minus b squared. So in this case,
279:51 - c squared is six squared minus five squared,
which is 11. Which means that C is the square
279:56 - root of 11, which is a little bit bigger than
three So, the two first sigh, our distance
280:03 - of squared of 11, above and below the center,
and so they'll have coordinates of four, negative
280:13 - three plus a squared of 11 and four, negative
three minus the square root of 11. This video
280:21 - detailed the anatomy of ellipse, including
its major axis, its minor axis, its vertices,
280:30 - and its fossa. This video is about hyperbolas.
You might recall that any lips is the set
280:41 - of points x y, such that the sum of the distances
between x y and two fixed points called the
280:52 - fo cy is a constant. Well, I hyperbola is
a set of points x y, such that the difference
281:01 - of the distances between x y and each of two
fixed points, called the first side is a constant.
281:17 - In this picture on the left, the two blue
lines are the two branches of the hyperbola.
281:24 - The two red points are the focuses or foe
side. So, for a point x, y on the hyperbola.
281:33 - If I look at the distance from x, y to one
focus, and the distance from x, y to the other
281:40 - focus, the difference of those two distances
will be the same no matter which point x y
281:49 - on the hyperbola that I choose. If I draw
a line between the two fourths I, that line
281:58 - is called the transverse axis. In this left
picture, we have a vertical transverse axis.
282:06 - And the hyperbola itself reminds me of a person
lying down horizontally. Now in the right
282:12 - picture, our transverse axis between the two
fo psi is horizontal. And the blue hyperbola
282:20 - itself kind of reminds me of a person standing
up vertically. It's possible for a hyperbola
282:26 - to be oriented other ways besides horizontally
and vertically, but will only consider horizontal
282:32 - and vertical orientations in this video. If
you look at where the transverse axis intersects
282:40 - the blue branches of the hyperbola, you'll
find these two points. those points are called
282:47 - the vertices. Notice that the vertices are
the two points on the two branches that are
282:52 - closest to one another. The point halfway
between the two vertices, it's also halfway
282:58 - between the two foes side is called the center
of the hyperbola. The two black dotted lines
283:05 - that I've drawn that form an X are not actually
part of the hyperbola. They're called the
283:11 - asymptotes. And you can think of them as guidelines
for drawing the hyperbola. Because the hyperbola
283:17 - gets closer and closer to these asymptotes,
but doesn't cross them. We'll talk more about
283:21 - the asymptotes later. Let's find the equation
of a hyperbola with both sides at negative
283:27 - c zero, and c zero, and vertices at negative
a zero and a zero. This hyperbola will have
283:34 - at center at the origin. From the distance
definition of hyperbola. We know that if we
283:40 - have a point x, y on the hyperbola, then if
we take the distance from that point to the
283:47 - first focus, and the distance to the second
focus and subtract them, we should get a constant.
283:54 - We're always taking the positive difference
here. So if we're on the right branch, we'll
283:59 - take the distance to the left focus minus
the shorter distance to the right focus. And
284:04 - if we happen to be on the left branch, then
we would take the longer distance to the right
284:12 - focus minus the shorter distance, the left
focus, when we do the differences that way,
284:17 - we should always get the same number. And
in fact, that difference should equal to A
284:21 - I'll show you why. The reason is, if I take
my point to be this vertex here, then its
284:28 - distance to this focus is exactly c minus
A because C is bigger than a. And this distance
284:37 - to that focus is going to be well let's see,
this is a, this is a and this is c minus a.
284:45 - So that different distance will be a plus
a plus c minus a. Now I'm going to do the
284:51 - difference, A plus A plus c minus a minus
c minus a. That simplifies to A plus c minus
285:03 - c plus a, which is two a. Now I'll focus on
a point on the right branch, I'll actually
285:10 - write a formula for its distance to this point.
That's the distance formula, it's going to
285:15 - be x minus negative c squared plus y minus
zero squared. That's the longer difference
285:24 - distance. Now I subtract the shorter distance,
which is the distance to this focus. And they're
285:31 - the distance formula gives me x minus c squared
plus y minus zero squared. That should always
285:37 - equal to A for any point on that right branch.
I'll clean up the inside of the square roots
285:44 - a little bit. After that a chunk of algebra,
which I won't do here allows you to simplify
285:51 - this equation to see squared minus a squared
times x squared minus a squared y squared
285:59 - equals a squared times c squared minus a squared.
Since this expression, c squared minus a squared
286:04 - is appearing a couple times here, I'm going
to give it a new name, I'm going to let b
286:09 - squared b c squared minus a squared. Now I
can rewrite my equation as b squared x squared
286:15 - minus a squared y squared equals a squared
b squared. And dividing both sides by a squared
286:21 - b squared, you'll have the equation x squared
over a squared minus y squared over b squared
286:28 - equals one. In this equation, notice that
a represents the distance from the center
286:37 - to a vertex. The quantity C is not directly
in this equation, but it's related to a and
286:44 - b by this equation, which can also be rewritten
as c squared equals a squared plus b squared.
286:51 - Or if you prefer, a squared equals c squared
minus b squared. I remember this one. And
286:57 - remember that C, which is the distance from
the center to the focus is the largest of
287:02 - the three quantities A, B, and C. So you might
be wondering, Well, what is B represent? Well,
287:07 - I'm going to draw a box, whose center is at
the center of my parabola that stretches out
287:14 - in a from either direction left, right, and
stretches up by B in either direction, up
287:21 - and down. It turns out that the corners of
such a box will be exactly on these two asymptote
287:29 - lines. In other words, the slope of this asymptote,
its rise over its run is b over a. And for
287:39 - this asymptote that's slipping downwards.
Its rise over it's Ron is negative b over
287:45 - a. So I can actually write the equations of
the asymptotes. For this hyperbola, centered
287:51 - at the origin as y equals B over A x and y
equals negative B over A x. We did all this
288:04 - work for a standing up hyperbola with its
transverse axis oriented horizontally. Let
288:10 - me rearrange things. And we'll see what changes
if a hyperbola is oriented the other way.
288:16 - In this case, where we have a vertical transverse
axis, the roles of x and y are completely
288:22 - switched. So our equation, which we could
derive the same way, becomes y squared over
288:28 - a squared minus x squared over b squared equals
one, we still have the same formulas c squared
288:35 - equals a squared plus b squared. And the two
related formulas b squared equals c squared
288:40 - minus a squared, and a squared equals c squared
minus b squared. A is still the distance from
288:46 - the center to the vertex. And c still represents
the distance from the center to a focus. Now
288:53 - our box will extend up and down by a units
and left and right by b units. So this time,
289:01 - the slope of the asymptote, the rise over
the run is going to be a over b for the line
289:09 - that sloped up and negative a Overby for the
line that sloped down. This means our asymptotes,
289:18 - which go through the center at the origin
will be given by the equations y equals a
289:23 - over b x and y equals negative a over bx.
I want to point out that in this notation,
289:30 - a is going with x in one form of the equation
and y and the other form of the equation,
289:36 - but it always goes with the positive term,
the term that's added and subtracted, whereas
289:42 - B goes with the negative term, the term that
subtracted which term is positive there, the
289:49 - x squared or the Y squared determines the
orientation of the hyperbola this way or that
289:55 - way. So far, we've been considering only hyperbola
Due to the origin, and we had these two equations
290:02 - for them, if we sent her as an arbitrary point,
HK, instead, we just subtract h from the x
290:10 - term and subtract k from the y term. The graphs
are shifted over by age and up by K. And to
290:21 - get to the vertices, we just start at the
center, and go left and right, by a, or up
290:32 - and down by a depending on which way the hyperbola
is oriented. So the vertices here are at h
290:41 - plus a K, and H minus A k. Whereas over here,
the vertices are at h, k plus a and h, k minus
290:52 - a. To get to the focuses, we have to go over
by C, or up and down by c, where c squared
291:06 - equals a squared plus b squared. Finally,
the asymptotes still have the same slopes
291:14 - as before. But this time, they have to go
through the center, which is at h k instead
291:19 - of 00. Their equations are going to be given
by y minus k equals B over A x minus h. And
291:27 - y minus k is negative B over A x minus h,
or with the other orientation, the analogous
291:35 - thing y minus k equals a over b x minus h,
and y minus k equals A over B, negative a
291:43 - over b, x minus h. We've done all the abstract
theory, let's do one example with numbers.
291:50 - If we're given this hyperbola, we can read
off its center as six, negative three. Since
291:58 - the x term is positive, I'm gonna let A be
the square root of four, and B will be the
292:04 - square root of 25. Since the x term is positive,
and the y term is negative, the hyperbola
292:11 - is going to be oriented standing up like this.
With a horizontal transverse axis, the distance
292:20 - from the center to each vertex is given by
the number A, which is two. So the left vertex
292:28 - will have coordinates for negative three,
and the right vertex will have coordinates
292:33 - eight, negative three. To find the full side,
I need to figure out c squared, which is a
292:41 - squared plus b squared, or four plus 2529.
So C is the square root of 29. I'll sketch
292:51 - ballpark position of my first eye here, and
the coordinates are going to be at let's see,
292:59 - the center is six, so six minus square 29,
same y coordinate of negative three, and the
293:05 - six plus squared of 29 negative three. Finally,
the asymptotes will form an X going through
293:13 - the center with slope given by B over A, which
is five has and negative b over a negative
293:24 - five halves. The equations for those lines
will be y plus three, coming from the center
293:32 - equals five halves x minus six, and y plus
three equals negative five halves x minus
293:39 - six. This gives a decent rough sketch of the
hyperbola. If I want to be a little more accurate,
293:44 - I could also plot some points by plugging
in values of x and solving for y or vice versa.
293:49 - In this video, we gave two equations for hyperbolas.
Which one you use depends on how the hyperbola
293:57 - is oriented. A has to do with the distance
between the center and the vertex, the number
294:04 - c, which can be figured out from the equation
c squared equals a squared plus b squared,
294:10 - is going to represent the distance from the
center to the focus. And B and A together
294:18 - help determine the slope of the asymptotes.
This video introduces the idea of polar coordinates.
294:26 - Polar Coordinates give an alternative way
of describing the location of points on the
294:32 - plane. Instead of describing a point in terms
of its x and y coordinates, those are the
294:39 - Cartesian coordinates of the point. When using
polar coordinates, we instead describe the
294:44 - point in terms of radius r, and an angle theta.
r is the distance of the point from the origin
294:53 - and theta is the angle that radius line makes
with the positive x axis. Let's plot these
295:05 - points given in polar coordinates. So the
eight here is the value of the radius, and
295:10 - the negative two thirds pi is the value of
the angle theta. The negative angle means
295:17 - that I need to go clockwise from the positive
x axis, instead of counterclockwise, like
295:22 - I normally would for a positive angle. So
here, a negative two thirds pi means that
295:29 - I need to go to this line right here. And
the eight of for the radius means I need to
295:36 - go eight lines out from the origin. So my
point should be around right here. The next
295:42 - point has a radius of five and an angle of
three pi. The angle of positive three pi means
295:51 - that I go counterclockwise starting at the
positive x axis, here, I've gone around by
295:56 - two pi. And here, I've got an extra pi to
make three pi. Now the radius of five means
296:03 - I need to go five units out from the origin.
So that puts me about right here. Notice that
296:11 - I could have also labeled this point with
the polar coordinates of five Pi, there's
296:17 - more than one way to assign polar coordinates
to a point. The next point has an angle of
296:23 - pi over four, and a radius of negative 12.
The negative radius means that I need to jump
296:31 - to the other side of the circle before I plot
the point. In other words, instead of plotting
296:37 - the point at an angle of pi over four and
a radius of 12, which would be about right
296:44 - here, I go to the opposite side of the circle,
and plotted at the same distance from the
296:50 - origin, but 180 degrees or pi radians around
the circle over here. Now I could have also
297:00 - labeled this point using a positive radius
of 12. And using an angle of pi over four
297:07 - plus pi, or five pi over four. And in general,
a point with polar coordinates of negative
297:16 - r theta means the same point as the point
with polar coordinates r, theta plus pi, adding
297:23 - pi just makes us jump around to the opposite
side of the circle. To convert between polar
297:33 - and Cartesian coordinates, it's handy to use
the following equations. First, x is equal
297:40 - to r cosine theta, y is equal to r sine theta
r squared is equal to x squared plus y squared,
297:54 - which means that R is plus or minus the square
root of x squared plus y squared. And tangent
298:01 - theta is equal to y divided by x. Let's see
where these equations come from. If we draw
298:09 - a point with coordinates, x, y, and draw lines
to make a right triangle, the height of that
298:18 - triangle is y, the length of the base is x.
And the high partners has length r, theta
298:28 - is the measure of this interior angle. From
trig, we know that cosine theta is equal to
298:36 - adjacent over high partners. So that's x over
r, which means that x is equal to r cosine
298:45 - theta. Similarly, sine theta is opposite over
hypotenuse, that's y over r, which means that
298:54 - y is equal to r sine theta. That gives us
the first two equations. The Pythagorean Theorem
299:02 - tells us that x squared plus y squared is
equal to r squared. And that gives us the
299:09 - third equation. Finally, tangent theta is
opposite over adjacent. So that's y over x,
299:20 - which is the fourth equation. To convert five,
negative pi over six from polar to Cartesian
299:27 - coordinates, we just use the fact that x equals
r cosine theta, and y equals r sine theta.
299:36 - So in this case, x is equal to five times
cosine of negative pi over six, that's five
299:44 - times square root of three over two, and y
is equal to five sine negative pi over six.
299:53 - So that's equal to negative five halves to
convert negative one, negative one From Cartesian
300:01 - to polar coordinates, we know that negative
one and negative one are x and y values. So
300:07 - we need to use the fact that r squared is
x squared plus y squared, that is r squared
300:16 - is negative one squared plus negative one
squared are two. Also, tangent theta is y
300:26 - over x, so that's negative one over negative
one, or one. Now there's several values of
300:33 - r and theta that satisfy these equations are
could be squared of two, or negative the square
300:40 - root of two, and theta could be Pi over four,
or five pi over four. Or we could add multiples
300:49 - of two pi to either of these answers. But
not all combinations of r and theta, get us
300:57 - to the right point. The point with Cartesian
coordinates negative one negative one lies
301:04 - in the third quadrant. But if we use a theta
value of say, pi over four and an R value
301:12 - of square root of two, that would get us to
the first quadrant. So instead, we need to
301:17 - use the polar coordinates of square root of
two and five pi over four. Or if we prefer,
301:27 - negative square root of two, and pi over four.
We could also add any multiple of two pi to
301:33 - either of these values of theta, and get yet
another way of representing the point and
301:38 - polar coordinates. This video talked about
polar coordinates, and converting between
301:46 - Cartesian coordinates and polar coordinates,
using some familiar equations from trig. This
301:55 - video introduces the idea of parametric equations,
instead of describing a curve as y equals
302:02 - f of x, we can describe the x coordinates
and y coordinates separately in terms of a
302:08 - third variable t, usually thought of as time.
so we can write x as a function of t, and
302:18 - y as a separate function of t. This is especially
useful as a way to describe curves that don't
302:27 - satisfy the vertical line test, and therefore
can't be described traditionally as functions
302:33 - of y in terms of x. A Cartesian equation for
a curve is an equation in terms of x and y
302:39 - only. parametric equations for a curve give
both x and y as functions of a third variable,
302:47 - usually T. The third variable is called the
parameter. That's our first example, let's
302:54 - graph the parametric equations given here
on an x y coordinate axis. Well, we'll do
303:02 - this by finding x and y coordinates that correspond
to the same value of t. For example, when
303:09 - t is negative two, you can calculate that
x by plugging in negative two for t gives
303:16 - you five and why, when you plug in negative
two for t gives you eight. Please pause the
303:23 - video for a moment and fill in some additional
values of x and y. For some additional values
303:29 - of t. Your chart should look like this. And
when we plot the XY pairs and connect the
303:35 - dots, we get something like this. It says
this point over here corresponds to a T value
303:42 - of negative two. And this point over here
corresponds to the t value of two. So if we
303:49 - think of t as time, we're traversing the curve
in this direction. To find a Cartesian equation
303:58 - for this curve, we need to eliminate the variable
t from these equations. One way to do this
304:05 - is to solve for t and one equation, say the
first equation. So two t is equal to one minus
304:14 - x, which means that t is one half minus x
over two, then we can plug that expression
304:21 - for t into the second equation and get y equals
one half minus x over two squared plus four,
304:31 - which simplifies to the quadratic equation,
y equals 1/4 X squared minus one half x plus
304:41 - 17 fourths. Let's try some more examples.
A table of values for the first example helps
304:50 - us draw the familiar graph of a circle of
radius one. This should come as no surprise
304:58 - since the equations x equals cosine t and
y equals sine t are familiar from trig as
305:05 - a way of describing the x&y coordinates of
a point on the unit circle. Notice that when
305:12 - t equals zero, our curve lies on the positive
x axis. And as t increases from zero to two
305:19 - pi, we traverse the curve once in the counterclockwise
direction. A Cartesian equation for this unit
305:27 - circle is given by the equation x squared
plus y squared equals one. This follows from
305:35 - the trig identity cosine squared t plus sine
squared t equals one by substituting in X
305:43 - for cosine t, and y for sine t. Please pause
the video for a moment to graph the second
305:50 - curve and rewrite it as a Cartesian equation.
The table of values should help you see that
305:59 - the graph is again a unit circle. But this
time, as t increases from zero to two pi,
306:06 - we actually traverse the circle twice in the
clockwise direction, I'll draw this with a
306:12 - double arrow going clockwise. The Cartesian
equation for this graph is still x squared
306:20 - plus y squared equals one. And so we found
two different parameterizations. For the same
306:29 - graph on the X Y axis. Let's take a look at
the third equation. There's no interval value
306:36 - specified for t here. So let's just assume
that t can be any real number. Now as T ranges
306:43 - from negative infinity to infinity, our Y
values, which are given by cosine t, oscillate
306:50 - between one and negative one. Our x values
are always the square of our Y values. So
306:58 - the graph of this curve has to lie on the
graph of x equals y squared, which is a sideways
307:07 - parabola. But a parametrically defined curve
doesn't cover this whole parabola. Remember
307:13 - that y is given by cosine of t. So y can only
range between negative one and one. And so
307:19 - we're only getting the portion of the parabola
that I shade in here. As t varies from say,
307:26 - zero to pi, I traverse this parabola one time.
And then as t goes from pi to two pi, I go
307:33 - back again in the other direction. And as
T continues to increase, I traverse this parabola
307:40 - infinitely many times. The Cartesian equation
for this curve is the equation x equals y
307:46 - squared with the restriction that y is between
negative one and one. We've seen several examples
307:56 - where we went from parametric equations to
Cartesian equations. Now let's start with
308:01 - a Cartesian equation and rewrite it as a parametric
equation. In this example, y is already given
308:09 - as a function of x. So an easy way to parameterize.
This curve is to just let x equal t. And then
308:17 - y is equal to the square root of t squared
minus t, substituting in T for x, the domain
308:27 - restriction in terms of x just translates
into a restriction in terms of t. I call this
308:35 - the copycat parameterization. Since we've
successfully introduced the new variable t,
308:40 - but T just copies, whatever x does. In the
second example, we could try setting x equal
308:47 - to t, then we get 25 t squared plus 36. Y
squared is equal to 900. and solving for y,
308:57 - we'd have y squared equals 900 minus 25 t
squared over 36. So why is plus or minus the
309:08 - square root of this quantity? This is a very
awkward looking expression. In fact, why is
309:16 - that even a function of t here because of
the plus and minus signs. So let's look for
309:20 - a better way to parameterize this curve. Because
of the x squared and the y squared, this equation
309:28 - is a good candidate for parameterizing using
sine and cosine. In fact, if we divide both
309:34 - sides of the equation by 900, we get 25x squared
over 900 plus 36. Y squared over 900 is equal
309:45 - to one, which simplifies to x squared over
36 plus y squared over 25 is equal to one.
309:54 - If I rewrite this as x over six squared plus
y or five squared equals one, then I can set
310:05 - x over six equal to cosine of t, and y over
five equal to sine of t. And I can see that
310:13 - for any value of t, x over six and y over
five will satisfy this equation, simply because
310:22 - cosine squared plus sine squared equals one.
This gives me the parameterization x equals
310:29 - six cosine of t, y equals five sine of t,
which is a handy way to describe any lips.
310:39 - As a final example, let's describe a general
circle of radius r, and center HK. For any
310:51 - point, x, y on the circle, we know that the
distance from that point x y to the center
311:00 - of the circle is equal to r. So using the
distance formula, we know that the square
311:07 - root of x minus h squared plus y minus k squared
has to equal our squaring both sides, this
311:18 - gives us the equation for the circle in Cartesian
coordinates. So for example, if our circle
311:26 - has radius five, and has Center at the point,
negative 317, then its equation would be x
311:35 - minus negative three, that's x plus three
squared plus y minus 17 squared is equal to
311:43 - 25. One way to find the equation of a general
circle in parametric equations, is to start
311:52 - with the unit circle and work our way up.
We know that the unit circle with radius one
311:58 - centered at the origin is given by the equation
x equals cosine t, and y equals sine t. If
312:09 - we want a circle of radius r centered around
the origin instead, then we need to expand
312:16 - everything by a factor of R. So we multiply
our x and y coordinates by R. If we now want
312:24 - the center to be at HK instead of at the origin,
then we need to add h to our x coordinates
312:35 - and add K to all our Y coordinates. This gives
us the general equation for a circle in parametric
312:43 - equations. to match the Cartesian equation
above, we can write our same example circle
312:49 - and parametric equations as x equals five
cosine t minus three, y equals five sine t
313:01 - plus 17. In this video, we translated back
and forth in between Cartesian equations and
313:11 - parametric equations with a special emphasis
on the equations for circles. This video is
313:23 - about the difference quotient, and the average
rate of change. These are topics that are
313:30 - related to the concept of derivative and calculus.
For function y equals f of x, like the function
313:37 - whose graph right here, a secant line is a
line that stretches between two points on
313:45 - the graph of the function. I'm going to label
this x value as a and this x value as B. So
313:55 - this point here on the graph is going to have
an x value of a and a y value given by f of
314:02 - a, the second point will have x value B and
Y value f of b. Now the average rate of change
314:11 - for a function on the interval from a to b
can be defined as the slope of the secant
314:23 - line between the two points A F of A and B
f P. in symbols, that slope m is the rise
314:36 - over the run, or the change in y over the
change in x, which is the difference in Y
314:43 - coordinates f of b minus F of A over the difference
in x coordinates b minus a. So this is the
314:53 - average rate of change. To put this in context,
if for example, f of x represents the height
315:01 - of a tree. And x represents time in years,
then f of b minus f of a represents a difference
315:11 - in height, or the amount the tree grows. And
B minus A represents a difference in in years,
315:16 - so a time period. So this average rate of
change is the amount the tree grows in a certain
315:23 - time period. For example, if it grows 10 inches
in two years, that would be 10 inches per
315:30 - two years, or five inches per year would be
its average rate of change its average rate
315:34 - of growth, let's compute the average rate
of change for the function f of x equals square
315:40 - root of x on the interval from one to four.
So the average rate of change is f of four
315:49 - minus f of one over four minus one, well,
f of four is the square root of four of one's
315:56 - a square root of one. So that's going to be
two minus one over three or 1/3. Instead of
316:05 - calling these two locations on the x axis,
a and b, this time, I'm going to call the
316:13 - first location, just x and the second location,
x plus h. The idea is that h represents the
316:22 - horizontal distance between these two locations
on the x axis. In this notation, if I want
316:30 - to label this point on the graph of y equals
f of x, it'll have an x coordinate of x and
316:38 - a y coordinate of f of x. The second point
will have an x coordinate of x plus h, and
316:44 - a y coordinate of f of x plus h. a difference
quotient is simply the average rate of change
316:52 - using this x x plus h notation. So a different
version represents the average rate of change
317:02 - of a function, f of x on the interval from
x to x plus h. Equivalent way, the difference
317:14 - quotient represents the slope of the secant
line for the graph of y equals f of x between
317:22 - the points with coordinates x, f of x, and
x plus h, f of x plus h. Let's work out a
317:33 - formula for the difference quotient. Remember
that the formula for the average rate of change
317:39 - could be written as f of b minus F of A over
B minus A, where a and b are the two locations
317:47 - on the x axis. But now I'm calling instead
of a I'm using x instead of B, I'm using x
317:54 - plus h. So I can rewrite this average rate
of change as f of x plus h minus f of x over
318:03 - x plus h minus x. That simplifies a little
bit on the denominator. Because x plus h minus
318:12 - x, I can cancel the Xs, and I get the difference
quotient formula f of x plus h minus f of
318:21 - x over h. The quantity h on this nominator
It looks like a single entity, but it still
318:28 - represents a difference in x values. Let's
find and simplify the difference quotient
318:35 - for this function given first, or write down
the general formula for the difference quotient.
318:41 - That's f of x plus h minus f of x over h.
I'm going to compute f of x plus h first,
318:50 - I do this by shoving in x plus h, everywhere
I see an x in the formula for the function,
318:58 - that's going to give me two times x plus h
squared minus x plus h plus three. Notice
319:08 - how I use parentheses here. That's important
because I need to make sure I shove in the
319:14 - entire x plus h for x. So the entire x plus
h needs to be subtracted, not just the x part,
319:21 - so the parentheses are mandatory. Similarly,
the parentheses here signal that the entire
319:27 - x plus h is squared as it needs to be. I mean
going to go ahead and simplify a bit right
319:33 - now. I can multiply out the x plus h squared,
I can go ahead and distribute the negative
319:42 - sign. So if I multiply out, I'm gonna get
X squared plus X h plus h x plus h squared.
319:52 - Now I can distribute the two to get 2x squared
plus 2x H plus two h x plus two h squared
320:02 - minus x minus h plus three, these two terms
are actually the same, I can add them up to
320:08 - get 4x H. And I think that's as simple as
I can get that part. Now I'm going to write
320:17 - out F of x plus h minus f of x. So that's
going to be this thing right here, minus f
320:25 - of x. Again, I need to put the F of X formula
in parentheses to make sure I subtract the
320:31 - whole thing. I'll distribute the negative.
And now I noticed that a bunch of things cancel
320:38 - out. So the 2x squared and the minus 2x squared
add to zero, the minus x and the x add to
320:45 - zero, and the three and the minus three add
to zero. So I'm left with 4x H plus two h
320:55 - squared minus h. Finally, I'll write out the
whole difference quotient by dividing everything
321:04 - by H. I can simplify this further, because
notice that there's an H in every single term
321:10 - of the numerator. If I factor out this H,
H times 4x, plus two h minus one divided by
321:18 - h, these two H's cancel, and I'm left with
a difference quotient of 4x plus two h minus
321:25 - one. This difference quotient will become
important in calculus, when we calculate a
321:31 - difference quotient for smaller and smaller
values of h, eventually letting h go to zero
321:36 - and ending up with an expression that has
no H's in it and represents the derivative
321:41 - or slope of the function itself. In this video,
we use the formula f of b minus F of A over
321:49 - B minus A to calculate an average rate of
change and the related formula f of x plus
321:55 - h minus f of x over h to calculate and simplify
a difference quotient
