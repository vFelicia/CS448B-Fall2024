00:00 - the history object contains the URLs
00:02 - visited by the user within a browser
00:05 - window the history object is part of the
00:07 - window object and is accessed through
00:09 - the window. history
00:11 - property if you see here we have an
00:13 - alert with history. length the window is
00:17 - just implied this could easily be
00:20 - window. history. length so if I run
00:23 - that and it's going to say three that
00:26 - means there's three items in my history
00:28 - if I just put back here here we can see
00:30 - there's two here plus the current one
00:32 - that I'm on and we can also um do
00:37 - history. back and this is just a method
00:40 - it's just like clicking the back key on
00:43 - your browser okay I'm going to save this
00:46 - and then I'm going to run that it's
00:48 - going to show me the number of pages and
00:51 - then it goes back to the previous page
00:55 - now this can be tricky here so I can hit
00:57 - forward here to go back to the previous
00:59 - page but since I'm on code pin it
01:02 - automatically runs this again so I can't
01:05 - really change this and when I hit okay
01:07 - it's going to go back again so now we're
01:10 - kind of in in an infinite loop we're
01:12 - stuck so we can't actually get back to
01:13 - that page to load it because it's
01:15 - automatically running this history. back
01:18 - well there is kind of a work around here
01:20 - so after this question mark I can just
01:22 - type in
01:24 - turn off
01:27 - JS equals true now I'm going to copy
01:31 - this whole thing and because when I
01:33 - press enter here it's still going to go
01:35 - back because it was already just about
01:36 - to do
01:37 - that now I'm going to paste in the
01:40 - website with the turnoff JS equals
01:44 - true and now it's not going to run the
01:47 - JavaScript automatically so I can um do
01:50 - a make this into a comment I can save
01:54 - this I can run that and now it's it's
01:57 - not going to oh I have to actually um
02:01 - remove turnoff JS equals true cuz I
02:03 - can't run it while that's on and so I'm
02:07 - going to go to this press enter to go to
02:09 - the website
02:10 - again and now it's going to show four
02:14 - but it's not going to go back because I
02:15 - have that commented out so another thing
02:18 - you instead of having back here you
02:20 - could put
02:21 - forward and another thing you can do is
02:24 - this
02:25 - history. go and if I put a number in
02:28 - here like three
02:30 - any any number here you it will go back
02:33 - that many times into the history so now
02:35 - it's going to go back three pages into
02:38 - the history or if you have it a positive
02:40 - number it's going to go forward pages
02:43 - into the history or if you have a zero
02:46 - it's just going to refresh the current
02:48 - page but I'm not going to demonstrate
02:50 - that because then we'll have the same
02:51 - problem with the JavaScript
02:53 - automatically running but another thing
02:55 - I want to show you is replace state
03:01 - okay replace State takes three
03:03 - parameters first I'll talk about the
03:05 - last one the last parameter is going to
03:09 - change the actual domain name up here so
03:13 - it's going to instead of saying l y JLG
03:16 - D it's going to say unicycle HTML the
03:20 - second parameter is not actually used by
03:23 - the browser it's for possibly in the
03:25 - future maybe JavaScript will use this
03:28 - but it just um sets a name to the the
03:31 - page and then this is a state object
03:35 - that you can pass in that you can then
03:37 - access this state later this can be any
03:39 - Json object basically I'm just using a
03:42 - string but it can be a Json object and
03:44 - this is going to basically replace this
03:48 - entry in the history so right now in the
03:50 - history it's going to have this website
03:52 - up here in the address bar replace state
03:55 - is going to replace this history entry
03:59 - with with this new history entry so the
04:03 - previous history entry won't even be
04:05 - there it won't even show this website
04:06 - it's going to show this website in in
04:08 - the history now there's a weird thing
04:11 - with code pen where it this doesn't
04:14 - actually work correctly but if I'm going
04:16 - to if I copy this I'm going to open up
04:18 - the JavaScript developer console by
04:20 - doing um option command J it's different
04:25 - on Windows and then I'm just going to
04:27 - run this command here
04:30 - and if I press enter you'll see right up
04:33 - here it changed it it's now unicycle
04:36 - HTML and if I run
04:39 - this you can see it's four which it was
04:41 - at four before so we haven't changed the
04:45 - number of pages in the history and now
04:48 - if we do
04:53 - console.log history. state and I'm going
04:57 - to run that
05:00 - it's going to pop up four and the
05:02 - console says bow is great that comes
05:04 - from this state here so you can access
05:08 - this first parameter that you pass in by
05:10 - just going to history. State now that's
05:13 - just a way to save some information um
05:17 - between pages and when you go to
05:19 - different pages you can access the same
05:21 - information now another thing to point
05:23 - out is that this website up here doesn't
05:27 - actually exist there is no code pin
05:29 - iboon pin unicycle .html so it didn't
05:34 - actually load that page when you call
05:37 - replace state it does not actually load
05:39 - the page it just changes it in your
05:42 - address bar up here you can put a full
05:45 - URL here as long as it it's has the same
05:49 - root URL that you were already
05:52 - on I'm just going to copy this and bring
05:55 - it into my console
06:00 - and we have an error so let's see what
06:02 - happened oh I should not have had the s
06:06 - for some reason I'm not on the secure
06:08 - version of code pin so it has to be the
06:11 - exact same uh beginning of the URL to
06:14 - work so let's try that again so now you
06:16 - can look up here codep pin. IBO is
06:20 - awesome so we can replace everything
06:23 - after the main domain name but if you
06:25 - put something wrong in the main domain
06:27 - name you get this error that we had up
06:29 - here and if I run this again you will
06:31 - see it's still going to have the number
06:33 - four here and when we ran that it's
06:35 - going to give me an error here because
06:37 - of a weird thing with code pin but I
06:39 - want to show you another one more thing
06:43 - history. push
06:49 - State now the first two parameters are
06:52 - optional push State and replace they are
06:54 - almost exactly the same so the first
06:57 - parameter is the state
07:00 - the second parameter is the name that's
07:02 - not used and the third parameter is what
07:04 - the domain name is going to be so we'll
07:07 - put this
07:11 - into free code Camp so I'm going to copy
07:15 - this and I'm going to bring over to the
07:17 - JavaScript console that's just of code
07:19 - pin here and if I run
07:22 - that now you'll see it's Cod pin.
07:26 - freecode camp and if I run this
07:31 - it says five up here remember before it
07:33 - kept saying four now it's saying five in
07:37 - replace date we replace the current
07:39 - history entry with a new history entry
07:44 - push date just adds a history entry so
07:47 - it's still going to have the page you
07:49 - were on in the history and now it's
07:51 - going to have a new page in the history
07:54 - so if I press the back button you'll see
07:57 - there's just an extra item here before
07:59 - we just had this first code pin history
08:01 - now we have the second code pin history
08:03 - right there well that's the history
08:05 - object thanks for watching my name is Bo
