00:05 - hey everybody is Jessie and today we're
00:10 - gonna switch over to using the newest
00:13 - version of material UI so this will be
00:18 - let's see we started with the the stable
00:22 - version then we switched to the alpha
00:25 - then we switched back to what we
00:28 - originally had and then a few days ago
00:32 - the beta version came out so now we're
00:35 - switching to that so I know we talked
00:38 - about switching yesterday and I didn't
00:43 - realize when we were talking about it
00:45 - that the beta version had already come
00:47 - out so I saw that on Twitter afterwards
00:49 - and I felt really stupid and then a few
00:53 - of you messaged me and told me about it
00:56 - so thanks for giving me the heads up on
00:58 - that I appreciate that let's see alright
01:06 - somebody in the in the live chats asking
01:08 - how do I get started with a series this
01:10 - is only the fourth stream in the series
01:12 - for this particular project so just go
01:17 - back to where it says I think starting
01:21 - my new react project if you want to see
01:25 - like the very beginning of the series
01:27 - you actually have to go to to my channel
01:30 - my personal channel the links in the
01:32 - description and if you if you check I
01:39 - can't remember what the name is I think
01:41 - it's the the first video is like
01:43 - building a website as fast as I can that
01:46 - might be the title so I did a few videos
01:49 - on my own channel before I got invited
01:51 - to livestream for this channel so that's
01:54 - where project one started but project
01:57 - two we're still in the beginning phases
02:00 - of that
02:07 - all right yeah and I am at work today so
02:10 - the video quality should be good
02:13 - sorry again about yesterday's quality
02:20 - I'm I'm in the middle of actually
02:23 - switching over so I'll show you how it's
02:26 - going so this is how it's going so far
02:33 - it's not too bad they were more there
02:36 - were more errors so I've gotten it down
02:39 - I've just been slowly working through
02:41 - error messages because it's definitely
02:44 - different
02:45 - so this switch once I switch it's not
02:49 - going to be that easy to go back so
02:52 - there's differences I guess this will be
02:55 - really good for anyone to watch if
02:57 - you're thinking about switching so let
03:01 - me go through some of the differences
03:02 - that I've noticed so far and I had to
03:04 - change let me bring up the code so I
03:16 - think this this is a good one where I
03:18 - had some differences all right so
03:24 - originally we were bringing in app bar
03:27 - and actually if you check out the code
03:30 - that's in the git repo right now it's
03:32 - the old code I haven't pushed any of the
03:34 - new stuff up yet because there's errors
03:36 - on I never really liked to push errors
03:38 - unless something comes up and I have to
03:41 - leave work and I just I need to push it
03:42 - so as soon as I get rid of the errors
03:45 - I'll push up the new code but for now
03:46 - it'll be alright because you can check
03:49 - on github what we did have and how we
03:52 - had to change it so I did leave some of
03:54 - the code in here seek at least see some
03:56 - of what we had down here and we did
03:59 - change some stuff up here but you have
04:02 - to check that out and github so they
04:06 - make this a bit bigger
04:08 - we had app bar we're bringing in app bar
04:11 - from material UI and all we had to do
04:14 - was put in a title and that's what
04:17 - show up at the top of our our app and
04:21 - you know then we had some other options
04:24 - for like clicking clicking the menu
04:28 - button and that was it it was pretty
04:33 - simple we've replaced this with this
04:37 - button app bar and this is a component
04:39 - that I've made but I basically just
04:42 - copied and pasted everything from the
04:45 - docks for the latest version of material
04:49 - UI so let me show you what I do so in
04:54 - order to get that same thing with I'm
04:56 - still not even sure this will work since
04:58 - I keep getting so many errors but in
05:00 - order to get that same thing it's a lot
05:02 - more complicated so I'm not necessarily
05:04 - saying that's a bad thing it seems like
05:06 - they'll be it'll be easier to customize
05:09 - things like this so I think it will end
05:11 - up being a good thing but for now it's
05:14 - just I'm gonna definitely have to change
05:17 - you know how we were doing things but
05:21 - basically we've got now instead of just
05:24 - a bar we have app bar toolbar typography
05:29 - button icon button menu icon so we're
05:33 - putting all of that together here and
05:36 - you can see some of the stuff is still
05:38 - similar I guess we have this is a little
05:46 - bit odd you know instead of being able
05:48 - to put the title we actually have to put
05:49 - it inside typography so I haven't played
05:53 - with it enough to know whether or not
05:54 - you absolutely have to have this but for
05:58 - now I'm just gonna kind of leave it
06:01 - there once I get it working then we can
06:02 - try to customize it and see what you
06:05 - know what happens there's a little bit
06:08 - so I've noticed for some things I've had
06:12 - to switch to this type of import so
06:15 - before for some of the things I could
06:18 - just import it like this like I'm doing
06:19 - with what say you know app bar toolbar
06:22 - so import app bar from material UI and
06:25 - slash app bar I was getting errors on
06:27 - some of that
06:28 - those and I had to switch it to look
06:32 - like this import and then inside my my
06:34 - curly brackets I'd have to put it listed
06:38 - so I just kind of keep going back and
06:40 - forth to the documentation and trying to
06:42 - figure out what the new way of doing it
06:44 - is so that's what I've been working on
06:49 - so far I had to change okay this is a
06:53 - good example so before I was able to
06:56 - bring in menu item just like this so I
06:59 - would so I would import menu item from
07:03 - material icons or material uimenuitem
07:05 - now I had to switch it and I have to
07:08 - import menu item from material you I'm
07:10 - menu so there's just little things like
07:13 - that that aren't really a big deal but
07:15 - it's a big enough deal to give you an
07:16 - error message so I'm sure it'd only take
07:21 - a few days to get used to how everything
07:23 - is especially since I wasn't really that
07:26 - used to the old way so right now I mean
07:30 - I'm just gonna work try to work through
07:32 - these error messages and let me bring
07:39 - pull that over there and bring this over
07:44 - so our error message that we're getting
07:46 - now and make this bigger Oh actually
07:50 - before we get into anything I do want to
07:52 - say thank you to Patrick and Sebastian
07:55 - for their pool requests so actually a
08:00 - lot of the stuff I just showed you
08:02 - probably seemed weird because those are
08:04 - all new things from pool requests so I'm
08:07 - sorry I totally forgot so a lot changed
08:09 - since yesterday let me take you through
08:12 - some of the changes just so that we're
08:15 - all on the same page so most of the
08:17 - changes are available in github right
08:20 - now so you can check them out as I'm
08:22 - going over them but right now in terms
08:26 - of how everything looks it all looked
08:29 - pretty much the same the changes were
08:32 - just how everything's laid out behind
08:36 - the scenes the only difference that you
08:38 - could see was Sebastian had
08:41 - the different background color to that
08:44 - active class so that it actually did
08:46 - show there was a visual representation
08:49 - of what page you were on when you open
08:51 - that that side drawer so this is what so
08:56 - this side nav component this was all
09:00 - Sebastian so he created the side nav
09:03 - component now of course as I said I've
09:05 - edited it to work with the newer
09:09 - material UI but the bulk of it is still
09:13 - the same
09:14 - I also edited the side nav to add this
09:18 - the sidebar item component so this is a
09:23 - component now so what I had done is so
09:25 - Patrick had submitted a pull request and
09:28 - it was the second pull request then
09:30 - Sebastian submitted pull request three
09:33 - so I think they were both working at the
09:35 - same time so Patrick had worked on some
09:39 - of the same stuff that Sebastian was so
09:42 - I kind of combined the two so I merged
09:45 - and Patrick to pull requests and I
09:48 - turned what he had you know he had
09:50 - basically had this component inside the
09:56 - main app.js file so it was just like
10:02 - okay I mean obviously I don't have it in
10:04 - here but it was just above here you know
10:09 - as a functional component and then he
10:14 - could you know call it you know down
10:17 - here this is all now changed a lot as
10:19 - well but basically I just took that I
10:22 - made it a component so that allowed me
10:26 - to use it this sidebar item inside the
10:33 - nav could side nav component that
10:35 - Sebastian had made so it worked out
10:39 - pretty well I had some trouble getting
10:44 - everything working but that was just
10:45 - entirely due to me messing up the prop
10:48 - names so for a second I thought I had
10:52 - some like really weird bug but it
10:54 - was just just using the wrong prop name
10:57 - so that happens let's see anything else
11:05 - okay on app dodge is a lot did change
11:09 - here as well so you Sebastian change it
11:13 - to use this switch so it's it's a lot
11:17 - more concise and you can see our app
11:24 - component now it's way shorter than it
11:27 - was so the top part where we're
11:29 - importing things actually you know we do
11:32 - have a lot of different things imported
11:35 - now Sebastian took all those can all
11:39 - those views and he imported them all so
11:44 - now they're actually working so you can
11:46 - see each one has like the bare-bones it
11:49 - needs to be a component which is awesome
11:51 - and so now this is all imported and so
11:58 - you can see what our routes will render
12:03 - each one of these views depending on
12:07 - what the URL is Sebastian also added a
12:11 - component in case it's it's some URL
12:15 - that's not here it's just just like a
12:18 - catch-all to tell users like hey that
12:22 - URL doesn't have anything so I think
12:25 - that's also Sebastian Sebastian did a
12:30 - lot of stuff in his pool request he
12:32 - added in the theme properly which I had
12:35 - to take a lot out of things so here's
12:37 - the theme right now because I was
12:39 - getting weird errors with the colors and
12:42 - I realized that I don't actually need to
12:44 - import the colors cuz I was just using
12:46 - the default colors anyway and the only
12:48 - color I had change was primary so I got
12:51 - rid of everything that didn't matter
12:52 - except this primary color that had
12:54 - changed and we can just add back in what
12:57 - we need as we go based on the new
12:59 - documentation and then that'll that'll
13:02 - help us get up and running a little bit
13:04 - faster right now because you know just
13:06 - one less there
13:07 - you less areas that we have to worry
13:09 - about but anyway thank you so much
13:11 - Patrick and Sebastian that helped a lot
13:16 - and made things a lot more clean and it
13:20 - took care of a lot of stuff some of
13:22 - which I had no idea how to do so it
13:24 - would have taken me a long time to
13:26 - figure it out so okay now that we're all
13:30 - caught up and everyone should have a
13:31 - decent idea of where we're at today
13:37 - we're gonna start fixing these errors so
13:42 - we're going to look at cannot Reaper you
13:44 - at bar of undefined in at barge s54 so
13:59 - that's not I don't like this error
14:05 - because at bar isn't even our component
14:12 - right at bar is at bar comes with with
14:19 - the theme so we're gonna have to look at
14:21 - the documentation then and see what the
14:24 - heck's going on with a bar so we have a
14:30 - bar it's just an aesthetic bringing a
14:33 - bar see that this is actually really
14:35 - weird because I copied and pasted this
14:39 - exactly from the documentation and that
14:41 - should be the only place that we're
14:43 - actually using a bar let's double check
14:47 - and make sure we didn't leave it in
14:48 - anywhere so inside I mean other than
14:59 - here which I can get rid of this now
15:07 - other than their I don't think we're
15:09 - using a bar anywhere let me check the
15:12 - live chat quickly I haven't even said hi
15:14 - to everybody yet
15:16 - also this is being broadcast
15:18 - simultaneously on YouTube and on
15:20 - Instagram so if you're watching on
15:22 - Instagram check out the free code camp
15:24 - YouTube channel and you can see the code
15:25 - that I'm working on and if you're
15:27 - watching on YouTube if you would like to
15:29 - see my face and some of my office while
15:32 - I'm doing this you can check me out on
15:34 - Instagram and the link to that is in the
15:37 - description for this video all right so
15:41 - let's see hey everybody
15:57 - Sharan is asking about links to my
16:00 - channel in the description okay it looks
16:06 - like you found it so awesome Joel says
16:16 - hi from Bolivia hey how's it going
16:18 - thanks for watching
16:39 - all right so getting some comments about
16:42 - I guess the new material you I wrote on
16:52 - says looked at Mervyn's here UI and I
16:54 - actually like how it bundle those
16:55 - multiple exports into one where it makes
16:57 - sense but the thing is you wouldn't
16:59 - immediately know without referring to
17:01 - the docs mm-hmm alright cool yes and the
17:08 - the editor is Adam to tell you the truth
17:10 - I'm pretty sure we had a few streams
17:14 - where no one asked about the code editor
17:15 - I was kind of disappointed maybe I'm
17:21 - mistaken maybe I have to go back and
17:23 - watch the streams but I'm pretty sure no
17:25 - one asks maybe yesterday or last week at
17:30 - some point I know there was at least one
17:31 - where I don't think anyone asked so
17:32 - broke the streak
17:58 - and then says hi campers any good
18:02 - resource to learn jQuery real quick
18:05 - I think the free code camp course goes
18:08 - through jQuery at first write the jQuery
18:12 - documentation is actually really easy to
18:14 - read so I would check that out
18:21 - as far as documentation goes some
18:23 - documentation is super difficult to read
18:26 - and but I think the jQuery Doc's are
18:29 - really really easy so I had some similar
18:35 - just joined an Instagram hey how's it
18:37 - going a couple people join in thanks for
18:40 - watching if you want to see the code
18:43 - check it out on free code camp youtube
18:49 - tone asks a fellow include redux I don't
18:53 - think I'm going to include Redux in this
18:55 - project I don't think it'll be needed
18:56 - but I'm there are plans for doing a
19:02 - really really big website in react and
19:05 - if that's the case I'm probably going to
19:07 - use some more advanced things for that
19:10 - so that projects coming so if just a
19:15 - little sneak peek the main website for
19:18 - the university needs redone it's like
19:20 - three years old at this point and the
19:24 - system it's built on is going extinct so
19:27 - we need to redo it and I'm like 90% sure
19:31 - it's gonna be redone with react and
19:34 - there's gonna be cool stuff with load
19:36 - balancing so we're gonna have lots of
19:39 - lots of servers with load balancing
19:42 - going on and lots of caching and things
19:44 - so because it needs to handle a lot of
19:46 - traffic so that's going to be fun to do
19:48 - so all these little react projects are
19:50 - building up to that I'm purposely
19:52 - testing out different things don't eat
19:54 - on that project so that's my plan so
19:57 - that's coming
20:05 - okay Umberto says hey Jessie are you
20:08 - able to comment out the place where you
20:10 - use app bar and see if the error goes
20:12 - away then debug from there I guess I
20:16 - could but really like I'm using app bar
20:20 - here you know and it's wrapping its
20:24 - wrapped there on all this stuff so I'm
20:26 - not sure I can't just comment that out
20:28 - without commenting all this stuff out
20:30 - and then that's basically the whole
20:33 - component what I could I guess like
20:43 - where am I using this set button hat bar
20:48 - I guess I could comment this out really
20:54 - quick and then I have to comment this
20:57 - out too so don't get in err
21:08 - so if you're new to react and you can't
21:11 - figure out how to do comments inside JSX
21:14 - this is how you do it it took me forever
21:17 - to figure this out I used to get errors
21:21 - because I tried to do comments and they
21:22 - wouldn't work so you have to use the
21:24 - curly brackets to drop into JavaScript
21:27 - and then you put your multi-line
21:29 - comments and that's how you have to
21:32 - comment it out it's a little bit more
21:35 - work alright so I'm gonna do that and
21:39 - just see what I get I don't even know
21:45 - where my there we go okay so I actually
21:55 - did get a different error let me show
21:56 - you what I've got going on over here
21:59 - so this is the the app so nav drawer is
22:08 - now undefined
22:33 - yeah and that's actually in this is
22:36 - another area that's that's within this
22:41 - material UI drawer component
22:53 - so I don't know what is going on
23:02 - let me read a few more comments here to
23:04 - see if anyone has any ideas for me hey
23:11 - Jordan Jordan says hi hey Jordan Phillip
23:18 - said Patrick saving Jesse's job one pull
23:20 - request at a time I like that I mean I'm
23:24 - pretty sure I still have a job but I
23:25 - really do appreciate all the pull
23:27 - request it does make me look better that
23:31 - I have these I give you all credit
23:33 - though even like in meetings all uh when
23:35 - we have our our department meetings I do
23:39 - bring up you know that you all have
23:42 - submitted pull requests most of the
23:46 - people in the meeting have no idea what
23:47 - I'm talking about
23:48 - I try to explain it but sometimes it's
23:52 - better just to say I've lots of people
23:53 - helping me
24:15 - XANA says she doesn't have Instagram oh
24:17 - uh I didn't have an Instagram until
24:22 - maybe two months ago and it's kind of
24:29 - fun I never thought it would it would
24:31 - really be I didn't think I'd be into it
24:33 - but it is kind of fun
24:43 - all right Sebastian says remove the
24:46 - prototype Moop remove the prop types oh
24:50 - okay
24:53 - is that what's causing my errors then
25:07 - actually
25:31 - oh really Oh unsaid my Instagram
25:33 - livestream keeps on buffering so I don't
25:36 - really know I I'm really new with
25:40 - everything on Instagram so I'm not I'm
25:42 - not even sure if I can change settings
25:44 - or anything it seems really basic you
25:46 - just hit a button to go live and there's
25:48 - not really any options
25:52 - alright so here's what I do want to say
25:59 - this is it possible is it possible that
26:05 - some stuff from the old version could
26:09 - have been left behind
26:10 - I do remember reading in the in the
26:15 - changelog something about I thought it
26:20 - was something about z-index being
26:22 - removed and that is actually part of
26:25 - what era I was getting
27:02 - all right bill says maybe delete yet
27:05 - then it sounds like a good idea I'm
27:07 - gonna go and I'm gonna delete material
27:11 - UI and then I'm gonna reinstall it and
27:15 - after I delete material UI I will
27:17 - manually check to make sure that it
27:20 - really is deleted so let's go and I mean
27:31 - this is where the shot this is really
27:33 - easy and if it fixes it that'll save a
27:35 - lot of time okay now let's check our
27:42 - node modules so we should have alright
27:51 - so there's no material UI we have the
27:54 - icons there but I'm gonna leave them
27:56 - because I've had no issues with the
27:58 - icons alright now I will
28:13 - I did the at next version and that did
28:16 - give me the the latest beta version is
28:19 - there some other way to do this that
28:21 - would get I mean I assume at this point
28:25 - it'll be fine it'll just give me the
28:27 - latest version so I did double-check in
28:30 - the node module to see what the version
28:32 - number was and I think it's beta v1 and
28:37 - it's like 0 0.2 or something like that
28:47 - Johnny asked if I'm using Ubuntu no not
28:51 - for my machine it's it's Mac I usually
28:53 - blew through all my servers 16 point o4
28:57 - yes uh ones using the Bluetooth so as
29:03 - Anna
29:04 - I'll join you said the console looks
29:07 - like Linux this is actually I term 2 for
29:12 - the console I mean it's all the same
29:14 - commands that you would use in Linux
29:17 - alright well hopefully that make a
29:21 - difference I'm gonna restart the server
29:24 - as well since that seems to help
29:26 - sometimes
29:33 - and I really wanted to start use using
29:38 - and rock like I had mentioned yesterday
29:41 - but is if I'm just getting errors right
29:44 - now there's really no point oh I'll
29:50 - start it if we get these fixed sorry if
29:57 - you're watching on Instagram I my phone
29:59 - just fell over and you're looking at the
30:01 - ceiling so I just noticed that hopefully
30:03 - it wasn't going on for a while let's see
30:11 - all right Sebastian says make sure you
30:13 - updated all the old version components
30:16 - to the beta ones
30:31 - all right let's see natural
30:45 - I'm gonna check out I guess is really
30:48 - not not much I can do except try to
30:55 - check out the docs for everything that
30:59 - I'm getting an error for and where I
31:04 - lost my dog oh hey there alright so I'll
31:11 - bring ease over and I'll leave this air
31:15 - up and so let's check out drawer
31:54 - okay it looks like there is some
31:55 - different stuff for the drawer sorry
32:03 - that was really small I didn't didn't
32:05 - realize that okay I'm gonna move this
32:07 - over to my other screen so I can compare
32:09 - it with the code that we're currently
32:12 - using for the drawer just to see if
32:16 - we're we're doing this the right way so
32:22 - I'm looking at the documentation for the
32:25 - newest version of material UI so I had
32:28 - you have to click the bar if you're
32:29 - gonna go to material - you i.com you
32:32 - have to click the bar at the top that
32:33 - says all ya material UI v1 is coming I
32:37 - like that that's fun so I'm just gonna
32:43 - check to see that I am importing what I
32:47 - need to import
33:03 - and see
33:28 - all right they definitely they have a
33:30 - different way of doing this this handle
33:36 - close I doubt that would be messing us
33:41 - up
33:48 - it's probably worth a shot
34:20 - and now it's saying like instead of
34:23 - saying this state let me bring this over
34:29 - so there's a lot more options going on
34:31 - here so you can open it from all these
34:34 - different places so this state open left
34:40 - then they have different ways to close
34:43 - it so maybe I ought to pull in a lot
34:48 - more what's going on here
34:52 - let me get check back in the live chat
35:08 - Rowen says at this point I would just
35:11 - try modifying other modules by hand and
35:13 - commenting out the offending lines
35:15 - yep sometimes I do things that make
35:17 - people kill themselves
35:22 - one says wouldn't it help to look for
35:24 - more info in the Aires call stack that's
35:29 - close yeah embarrass it says just
35:34 - remember to uncomment your button a part
35:36 - yeah maybe I should just uncomment that
35:38 - for now and then take these one at a
35:42 - time so we'll come back to the drawer
35:44 - thing let's handle this we'll handle
35:49 - them in order I have a feeling that once
35:54 - we figure out one or two of these then
35:56 - the rest won't be as big of a deal
36:01 - oops I forgot to uncomment this there we
36:06 - go okay now let's see what our air was
36:13 - and this one was giving us the air here
36:26 - okay so it is this z-index thing again
36:29 - so for both of the components the air
36:31 - we're getting has to do with this
36:34 - z-index themes the index at bar
36:50 - hmm
36:56 - actually let's check out let's check
37:04 - this out
37:17 - hmm
37:20 - I'm looking looking for things that were
37:25 - really new
37:34 - now as to
37:48 - all right it's worth the shot to just
37:49 - throw this in the Google search and see
38:04 - hello so I didn't really have much hope
38:07 - since this version just came out so let
38:15 - me go back to
38:24 - I wonder we so I did have something I
38:32 - mentioned earlier that I took a lot of
38:33 - stuff out of my theme and I did have
38:36 - some stuff in there I think about the
38:39 - index maybe it was about shadows I hope
38:42 - that that wasn't somehow required and
38:45 - now my themes overriding stuff and it
38:48 - has no there's nothing in there
39:24 - all right let's check out our theme
39:48 - hmm
39:51 - I have
40:34 - yeah let's check what it says about
40:38 - themes then says that seems to be the
40:42 - issue
41:32 - here we go
41:39 - seems he annexed a poor okay so in here
41:44 - in this thing we do have z-index at bar
41:48 - let's check out what we actually have
41:51 - and some triage styles theme jazz
41:54 - alright let's check out our theme JS
41:57 - file
42:29 - all right this looks different let's
42:34 - looks like we have
42:44 - the index touches
42:53 - okay it looks like it's here so so this
42:57 - should be getting imported into the
43:00 - themes well let's just copy this it's
43:08 - copy all of this and let's put it in our
43:12 - custom theme so let's see should be
43:24 - z-index
43:40 - all right not sure if that'll do
43:44 - anything
43:55 - heeey
44:04 - they see where my terminal went I moved
44:08 - it over
44:39 - all right cool hey we fix that error ha
44:43 - ha
44:44 - so hey guess what I have a better idea
44:51 - what if let's just copy everything in
44:55 - this theme Jas since it seems like it's
44:58 - legit and we'll paste it into the theme
45:01 - guess and our node module or better yet
45:05 - let's just paste it into our custom
45:07 - theme so we don't have to mess with our
45:08 - node modules so I mean a little bit
45:18 - repetitive here to have it all in there
45:21 - but instead of going through one by one
45:23 - it's think I think it makes a lot more
45:26 - sense to do it like this let me make
45:30 - sure where this starts okay
45:48 - all right
45:57 - stange it still Evers all right what is
46:04 - it now
46:08 - color theme get palette did did my
46:12 - restarting of the server actually do
46:13 - anything maybe it did
46:28 - okay all right so let's let's look
46:31 - specifically at what's going on here
46:33 - no that's not what we're a par 74 color
46:44 - theme palette you're conscious
46:56 - okay
47:01 - alright let me go back to the to the lab
47:04 - chat for a minute here
47:32 - let's see
47:42 - all right
47:46 - yeah so I'm not good thing everybody was
47:50 - still talking about z-index and I'm not
47:57 - I'm pretty sure that we've we've kind of
48:00 - with I don't want to say we fix the
48:03 - problem because really we just like
48:05 - worked around it but contrast Texas not
48:17 - hmm
48:20 - so the problem with everything is this
48:23 - theme file where's mine
48:33 - so this is really small let me make it
48:35 - bigger okay
49:53 - it really wasn't even a theme is there
50:54 - yeah
50:59 - sebastien s is that the old version
51:00 - theme now I think this these are the
51:03 - dogs now you're right it did switch over
51:05 - I thought I had the it must have
51:08 - switched over when I went to issues so
51:12 - good call on that Sebastian okay now we
51:16 - can actually see this
51:26 - okay palate
51:44 - this good Hallet
51:57 - there we go
51:59 - so I suppose whatever is they're saying
52:04 - it's not a function should be in this
52:06 - palette file all right which one were
52:14 - you looking for get contrast text yep
52:18 - this is it all right so for some reason
52:25 - it can't find that
52:32 - Why Why cannot find that let's see if we
52:39 - have a pallet J s file in our high
52:46 - modulus under Styles polishes
52:59 - get contrast text okay so we have it all
53:04 - right so we we obviously have the right
53:09 - function here
53:34 - okay it is bringing in pallet
53:43 - okay so I don't maybe I'm missing
53:47 - something I'm gonna go to a live chat
53:48 - and see but it seems to me like we just
53:50 - saw that this theme Dodge is is pulling
53:53 - in pilots which is requiring pallet and
54:02 - then when we looked in pallet we did
54:06 - have the correct function all right so
54:13 - let me scroll up a bit
54:25 - Frances asks can we fork your project
54:29 - and fix it for you yeah you can I don't
54:32 - really want to push things with errors
54:35 - up to github but I I might I might push
54:39 - this actually it won't let me my commit
54:41 - hook will probably not let me push this
54:43 - up
55:21 - all right let's see
55:29 - huh Joe honey says the next video should
55:32 - be named problem-solving with Jesse yeah
55:34 - honestly sometimes that's that's what
55:36 - happens so hey with someone else joined
55:39 - us in on the Instagram livestream so
55:44 - welcome if you want to check out the
55:46 - code that I'm working on go to free code
55:49 - camps YouTube channel and then you get
55:56 - to see what I'm seeing on my screen
56:15 - alright John Hanson said the Instagram
56:17 - live feed is great as it's not delayed
56:20 - sound to the YouTube live video cool
56:22 - alright that's cool
56:23 - I mean I'll I never realized that it was
56:25 - pretty cool
56:34 - Patrick says you're using the old theme
56:38 - way with the new beta way check out the
56:40 - docs for themes okay cool I will do that
56:46 - so let me see I think I have the docs up
56:52 - here still I thought I did did I move
56:57 - him yeah yeah I did I moved him to the
57:04 - other screen so I could see better so
57:12 - let's do the provider
57:26 - so it's full and so here's where I'm
57:30 - here's my FPS thing obviously I copied
57:35 - over pretty much everything let's see
58:08 - all right so maybe I am I'm thinking so
58:13 - I did update and where we get an app j/s
58:18 - I updated to thought I updated to the
58:23 - new way of pulling in a theme so we
58:26 - changed before this was different
58:29 - and so I updated that and also how we
58:40 - pull in the theme as well
59:11 - all right so maybe I'll pull this over
59:13 - so y'all can see what I'm looking at
59:14 - here so this is under the new
59:16 - documentation at the bottom of the
59:18 - themes page so maybe creating the theme
59:25 - is different as well
59:27 - so
59:44 - maybe I need to do something like this
59:52 - alright so let's try
60:06 - gets us to change the URL too
60:43 - oops
60:47 - put down the wrong spot with the
60:56 - Fierstein
61:10 - does that look right that does not look
61:12 - right let me see
61:37 - okay definitely get an air
61:59 - maybe I'm looking at the wrong
63:48 - John Henson in the live chat says great
63:51 - news I installed react on top of web
63:54 - hack pain in the works now using router
63:58 - as well for multiple pages links not
64:00 - trying to see if I can get sass to build
64:02 - separate files for each page that's
64:04 - awesome definitely let me know how sass
64:08 - works out for you
64:18 - synthetic today how did I put that in
64:21 - the wrong place probably I did
65:05 - yeah
65:13 - I'm still getting that air yeah John
65:19 - said the Instagram feed did die yeah so
65:21 - I guess Instagram has a limit of an hour
65:24 - on live streams so only the first hour
65:26 - of anything I do gets good streams
65:30 - imagine my stream was probably super
65:34 - boring for Instagram because it was a
65:37 - lot of me just looking at a screen I
65:39 - wasn't doing much talking so alright so
65:57 - I'm not sure
66:11 - I'm not exactly sure where to get an X
66:13 - from here no you think for a minute uh
66:18 - uh so I mean we had we made some
66:21 - progress and then we're stops
66:34 - okay let's see if we have a pallet
67:19 - what was where is our our github
67:25 - documentation for pallet
67:48 - I can't do this can i this isn't gonna
67:51 - work
67:52 - is there any way for me to put a
67:53 - function inside this object this I feel
67:58 - like this is like just objects 101 but
68:20 - we have figured I can't do that what if
68:29 - I get contrast ratio I hope I do like
68:34 - this
69:26 - okay
70:36 - okay so faster exists JavaScript has
70:40 - first-class functions of course you can
70:43 - put a function and an object or not like
70:45 - that just because you can doesn't mean
70:46 - the material UI knows how to use it yeah
70:58 - at this point I was just continuing on
71:01 - with our process of putting everything
71:05 - that we get an arrow and into our into
71:08 - our theme but it looks like this pulls a
71:10 - lot of other stuff so it's probably not
71:13 - a great idea because well we will
71:15 - literally end up having to put
71:16 - everything into there when the problems
71:25 - seems to be for some reason
71:37 - things aren't getting pulled into themed
71:40 - ijs properly
72:12 - actually hold on this this looks weird
72:18 - maybe I'm missing something I might be
72:24 - missing something one on in here but
72:27 - look in here it's saying palette is
72:30 - palette right but up here we're naming
72:38 - it underscore palette where else are we
72:40 - are we getting are we changing that
72:45 - somewhere okay here we go
72:53 - looks like we're defining palette here
73:22 - Rohan says I think it's the wrong way to
73:25 - go having to put everything in a custom
73:27 - theme file yeah I agree I think it was
73:30 - worth a shot if I could just get it to
73:31 - work with just the part that I put in
73:33 - but if I have to put in more than it's
73:35 - not it's going to be too much
73:54 - Tylar s in the lodge at what's your
73:57 - opinion on these new nano degree
73:58 - programs popping up and I'm going to
74:00 - answer that just to take a little break
74:02 - from this I'm I'm doing the react
74:07 - nanodegree program from Udacity right
74:10 - now in terms of the course quality and
74:14 - content I'm impressed with it so far
74:16 - I don't know firsthand whether a nano
74:20 - degree is helpful or getting a job
74:23 - excuse me he's yawning
74:27 - today is day two with no caffeine I
74:30 - think I'm gonna take a little break from
74:32 - it and see if it helps me sleep but I am
74:35 - you own anymore
74:36 - so anyway I don't know personally
74:39 - whether it helps getting a job of course
74:41 - you like I've read online that you know
74:44 - companies are starting to recognize them
74:48 - but I don't really know you know how
74:50 - many companies and so I'm not I'm not
74:54 - really sure if your main goal when
74:57 - taking a nano degree is to learn and you
75:00 - want to get feedback to do like the paid
75:02 - version and you know get a you know
75:08 - actually end up with a nano degree then
75:09 - I think it's good for that I just I kind
75:14 - of wonder like what people think when
75:16 - they see nano degree on a resume does
75:19 - that really mean anything or not I think
75:21 - at some point it might mean something
75:23 - into some companies it might mean
75:25 - something but I'm just not sure yet but
75:27 - I think it's you definitely learn a lot
75:38 - all right okay Patrick I see your your
75:42 - comment here you can't
75:43 - are you using create Mui theme which is
75:46 - how the dogs did let's see
76:06 - yeah so here's what I'm going up here
76:21 - Rowen says are we importing Mui theme
76:24 - provider yes I am importing that as well
76:29 - yeah that's the thing some stuff was
76:32 - working and even before I changed all
76:35 - this around which I couldn't even keep
76:37 - track of what I was doing I think I I
76:39 - think I've messed this up I should
76:42 - probably just undo everything since it
76:46 - was working but this was you know it
76:52 - fixed that z-index issue that we were
76:55 - having so obviously this was getting
76:58 - used somehow but I actually do think I
77:04 - should just undo all of the stuff I did
77:08 - in here I don't know they did it is
77:17 - fixing the z-index issue still right let
77:22 - me let me take out this stuff I did down
77:25 - here
77:47 - we got accidentally set a debug point
77:50 - didn't realize it okay yeah so that that
77:58 - that actually is taking care of that
78:00 - z-index issue it's going farther down in
78:04 - at bar Jaso the z-index thing was up
78:07 - here in line 54 now we've we've made it
78:10 - all the way down the line 74 and now is
78:12 - this pilot thing
78:59 - let me see I see I'm barrister I see
79:06 - what you're saying shouldn't that be
79:07 - from interior UI styles and UI theme
79:10 - provider let me see where I was having
79:12 - that I think I pulled this I think I
79:22 - pulled this right from the docks let me
79:24 - double-check
79:40 - yeah Patrick said I feel like this beta
79:43 - is an alpha yeah kind of regretting
79:48 - regretting the decision to do this the
79:51 - good thing is let me check my git log
79:55 - and see what I've actually done I don't
80:01 - know that I've actually committed any of
80:03 - this so we could just go back easily
80:11 - yeah so if this endeavor fails it won't
80:20 - be hard to go back to where we were at
80:22 - that's that's the beauty of get in
80:29 - version control in general so if you
80:32 - aren't using it this is a great reason
80:36 - to use git is if you if you mess up your
80:42 - app just pretty much beyond repair which
80:45 - is it's kind of what I think I've done
80:48 - just now
80:56 - then then it can help you can just go
80:59 - back mmm same thing
81:09 - oh actually we've got okay so I had gone
81:18 - in here and mess with some stuff
81:31 - actually okay so this makes at least
81:35 - this will help us narrow down so it's
81:37 - it's able successfully at least it was
81:40 - able to go into a theme palette
81:44 - background at bar but then when it tried
81:48 - to theme palette get contrast text it
81:53 - couldn't work so it it actually is
81:55 - importing so the issue then would
81:58 - probably be within palette dot Jas
82:39 - okay so this is where it is actually
82:42 - returning get contrast text
82:56 - and that is yeah that is the name of the
82:59 - function
83:28 - okay I said now I'm seeing what you all
83:31 - were saying about pushing into another
83:32 - granite branch first okay let's see
83:57 - so is that is there like a shortcut way
84:00 - for me to switch to another branch and
84:02 - commit these or do I need to commit them
84:04 - to master and then push to another
84:06 - branch and then just roll back the
84:08 - commits
84:51 - okay david says there is a shortcut way
84:56 - if anybody commits directly to branch
85:12 - alright let me check so like commit
85:18 - directly to to the UH to another branch
85:25 - okay cool it comes up as one of the
85:29 - options in the Google search
86:06 - all right making new parents check it
86:08 - out and the change will come with you
86:10 - and you changed and I had the chance to
86:11 - see wrench commit
86:19 - okay I had no idea that you could do
86:22 - this
86:34 - alright let me pull over I'm gonna do
86:37 - this so everybody can see it
86:41 - okay so this everybody knows what I'm
86:44 - doing I am on the master branch and I
86:47 - don't want to commit these changes to
86:49 - master branch
86:49 - I've decided according to the advice of
86:54 - you all that I should commit these on a
86:57 - different branch and then push it up to
86:58 - github and then that way everyone can
87:00 - see what's going on so that's what I'm
87:02 - attempting to do so I'm gonna get
87:05 - checkout Hey and then we're gonna say
87:20 - material you are beta
87:27 - okay cool
87:36 - awesome everything's right here grades
88:15 - I can't believe that made it through I
88:19 - thought for sure I had done something
88:21 - that was gonna cause an error that's
88:23 - awesome alright oops
88:42 - cool all right now it's on github cuo
88:46 - can see the mess that I've made
89:02 - yeah that's why I get
89:10 - all right
90:24 - okay so this should be working because
90:27 - it's undone everything but for some
90:33 - reason it's not
91:25 - there we go sir I didn't I didn't
91:29 - install the right packages so that's
91:32 - that was the problem
91:54 - all right so at least now I can show you
92:00 - show you this the the highlighting of
92:06 - the page you are on is working so I
92:11 - think this is what's yeah
92:32 - I think what I'll do for now maybe is
92:42 - give up on the idea of using the newest
92:47 - version so the whole point of me wanting
92:50 - to use the beta version instead of the
92:53 - normal one is for the coulomb class
92:56 - components and I figured that that would
93:00 - save me time in the long run by having
93:04 - all those extra components and it would
93:06 - be worth the set-up time and
93:08 - transferring it over I think now that
93:13 - that does that's not true anymore so the
93:17 - time I thought it would take to get this
93:19 - working was way less than what it's
93:22 - actually taking and then that's no
93:24 - longer a good decision time was I think
93:27 - it would be faster for me to just make
93:30 - my own column classes and use them I
93:36 - mean I could potentially even try to
93:39 - model them after what's in the beta if I
93:41 - want to but that's just too much also
93:47 - I'm a little worried that if I run into
93:51 - errors since it's so new there's not
93:55 - going to be a whole lot of other people
93:57 - talking about those errors all right one
94:04 - has to go see later one thanks for for
94:07 - joining us what Sun isn't that okay it's
94:10 - about 3:30 so yeah I think now's a good
94:14 - time for me to admit defeat for today
94:18 - and wrap things up so all in all today
94:23 - did did get a lot of stuff done behind
94:26 - the scenes in terms of getting the pull
94:29 - requests in and making some extra
94:32 - components and things so it wasn't you
94:37 - know in terms of trying to do the switch
94:39 - to the beta that that definitely was a
94:41 - failure but did I did get some stuff
94:45 - done on
94:46 - the site and can always come back since
94:48 - we've you know save those changes in
94:50 - another branch it's entirely possible to
94:52 - come back to that at some point but for
94:57 - right now I'm not sure that's the best
94:59 - idea so this is gonna be a very good
95:03 - lesson to me and maybe to someone else
95:05 - out there that it's probably better just
95:08 - to pick something and stick with it and
95:11 - not try to keep changing it because I've
95:14 - definitely wasted a lot of time I don't
95:17 - want to say wasted I mean learned some
95:19 - stuff along the way but it could have
95:22 - been using that time to actually build
95:23 - this out so don't like to I don't ever
95:30 - really like to back down from trying to
95:32 - figure something out but at some point
95:35 - there's just not enough time to figure
95:38 - some things out
95:46 - bill wrote react project to day ten
95:49 - design decided for real this time that
95:54 - actually does sound like something I
95:55 - would type if you've ever seen my commit
95:57 - messages if I try to commit something
96:01 - and I accidentally don't commit what I
96:03 - wanted to my next commit message is
96:06 - always do this thing for real this time
96:09 - so it is how I would say it okay so I'm
96:15 - gonna go back through the chat now and
96:17 - see if there's any questions that I
96:18 - missed I'm sure there probably is
96:20 - because I was so focused on this so if
96:27 - you have any questions put them in the
96:32 - live chat now if you can't stick around
96:34 - for the chat it Patricks if you can't
96:40 - stick around for the chat just direct
96:42 - message me on twitter or put it in the
96:45 - comments to this video and I'll get to
96:47 - him whenever I get a chance
96:49 - Patrick said dude commit amend yeah I
96:54 - actually did do an amend on a project I
96:58 - was working on my lunch break so I have
97:00 - done that before but usually honestly
97:04 - usually I don't even care enough to do
97:06 - an amend because it's just me working on
97:10 - these projects so um although now you
97:13 - all are working on them with me but like
97:15 - in the past it's always been just me
97:18 - working on these projects and no one
97:19 - ever looked at my gig commits so I got
97:23 - was lazy about it and I said I'll just
97:26 - do another commit it would be faster so
97:29 - I probably should start using amend more
97:34 - but
97:37 - all right so let me go through the chat
97:39 - here and if you got to leave now thank
97:46 - you so much for watching I'll be back
97:48 - tomorrow all right
98:15 - looking through right actually not
98:17 - really a lot of questions so far in the
98:20 - chat oh I see you all have made some
98:26 - comments on JSX
98:28 - comment tags being ugly I agree I mean
98:33 - it's not really that big of a deal I
98:34 - guess but I do wish there were a simpler
98:37 - way in a nicer looking way to do
98:40 - comments
99:14 - so Jan asks can you recommend me a good
99:18 - tool for debugging j/s that was that's a
99:25 - long time ago so I'm not sure if you're
99:26 - still around but I mean dev dev tools is
99:32 - pretty good chrome dev tools is good
99:35 - does anyone know of anything better than
99:37 - then chrome dev tools that's easy to use
99:41 - I mean I assume you're talking I guess
99:45 - about you know regular JavaScript I'm
99:49 - not sure how good dev tools is a
99:52 - debugging like node or I don't know if
99:55 - you're trying to do something with react
99:57 - native or something like that
99:59 - I'm sure maybe there's different
100:01 - debuggers for that but if just talk
100:02 - about like normal JavaScript that most
100:05 - people write
100:06 - I think dev tools is pretty good I
100:11 - haven't really used much of anything
100:13 - else though so maybe there's other
100:15 - things out there and not aware of
100:49 - nam says hi everyone I'm a new person
100:53 - I've gotten into programmer I like
100:56 - working on back-end or to be software
100:59 - engineer in general someone here could
101:01 - you suggest the programming language you
101:05 - like most I think this is not going to
101:11 - be a surprise to anyone I'm gonna say
101:13 - JavaScript so yeah it did
101:22 - I guess if your question is simply what
101:24 - do you like the most then I would say
101:26 - JavaScript although I did enjoy Python
101:31 - when I did some stuff in Python just
101:33 - because of like all the indentation and
101:36 - stuff it was really easy to do and you
101:39 - could actually program with Python on a
101:41 - phone it was easy with the phone
101:43 - keyboard normally programming on a phone
101:47 - keyboard is ridiculous because you know
101:50 - all the brackets and everything that you
101:52 - need take forever to get to someone
101:55 - should make an app that's a phone
101:57 - keyboard for programmers and you could
102:00 - have custom keyboards depending on the
102:02 - language that you're using that would be
102:05 - awesome I would like that app I mean I
102:06 - don't really plan on programming that
102:09 - much on my phone if ever but if they're
102:12 - a really good keyboard that made it easy
102:14 - I would definitely like that because I'm
102:18 - sure there's some keys that you could
102:20 - just do without because you don't use it
102:22 - that often and you could replace it with
102:25 - brackets something that you use for
102:29 - anyway or maybe an app that's like an
102:34 - editor a mobile editor so not only does
102:37 - it have the keyboard but it also has all
102:39 - the features that you would have been
102:41 - like a code editor the autocomplete and
102:44 - things like that
102:49 - anyway if anybody wants to work on that
102:53 - project if you open it up and make a
102:56 - repo on github all I'll try to
102:58 - contribute to it
103:32 - okay Noam says thanks for the suggestion
103:38 - not thanking me this was earlier
103:41 - thanking Rohan for the suggestion of
103:43 - Rowan actually suggesting Python as well
103:45 - this is actually most people using
103:47 - Python tend to machine learning or data
103:49 - science my favorite is creating apps
103:52 - actually so nam if you're interested in
103:54 - creating apps you could try to go with
103:57 - one of like the native app languages so
104:00 - for iOS I think it's it's Swift right
104:03 - and then for Android it's Java but now
104:07 - you can use Kotlin which I don't know
104:09 - anything about Kotlin but I'm pretty
104:11 - sure you can use it to make apps on
104:13 - Android so if you wanted something else
104:19 - to make apps with you could make apps
104:21 - with JavaScript using react native so I
104:26 - guess it depends on which what you want
104:29 - to do the good thing about doing it with
104:32 - JavaScript is that it would let you more
104:35 - easily make apps for iOS and Android if
104:40 - you just focus on on one or the other
104:43 - then it would probably be a little bit
104:45 - harder to switch that's my assumption I
104:47 - don't really know cuz I haven't done it
104:48 - but anyway that would be my advice
104:54 - either JavaScript with react native or
105:00 - one of the native languages for iOS or
105:03 - Android
105:27 - well I didn't see this so I I definitely
105:33 - didn't see this so sorry if you're doing
105:34 - here but it's free code camp said how
105:36 - much longer you'll be streaming so I'm
105:37 - assuming that was someone else logged in
105:40 - as free code camp while I'm streaming he
105:42 - said that I didn't even know you you
105:44 - could do that but if you're still
105:48 - watching I want to wrap this up by 4
105:52 - o'clock
106:09 - all right so I'm gonna skip through it
106:12 - looks like there's a lot of discussion
106:14 - about helping Blake with his I guess
106:20 - there's portfolio project so I'm gonna
106:22 - skip through a bunch of that how I bill
106:29 - said drinking some G fuel thanks Jesse
106:31 - for bringing this into my life cool I'm
106:33 - glad she liked the G fuel so ahead I had
106:38 - mentioned before that I I drink e fuel
106:41 - and so bill had asked me about it and I
106:44 - directed him to the the chief fuel site
106:46 - so yeah I liked it and I guess bill
106:50 - likes it so I need to get like some
106:53 - affiliate programs set up so I can get I
106:56 - can get you all a discount if you use my
106:59 - code or something like that I think I
107:03 - need a lot more people watching me
107:04 - before I would they would want me to be
107:07 - an affiliate
107:32 - okay almost to the bottom of the live
107:34 - chat
107:57 - Jordan has any good videos on git and
108:01 - Sarah said Udacity has some good visit
108:03 - yeah actually I really like the Udacity
108:06 - course on git
108:10 - that was really good I I'm pretty sure
108:14 - learn Codecademy that that's the YouTube
108:18 - channel learn code Academy has some
108:20 - videos on git
108:24 - there's videos on get on for free code
108:27 - camp so on this channel
108:31 - yeah so between those you can get a
108:33 - pretty good idea about how to use git
108:48 - okay in regard to the JavaScript
108:51 - debugging question from a few minutes
108:52 - ago jordan says Firebug works as well
108:57 - and David says Visual Studio code has
109:00 - built-in JavaScript debugging that can
109:02 - be used in the editor which is nice so
109:04 - that's cool I didn't didn't realize that
109:07 - so those are some other options John
109:12 - Hanson has a question is it better to
109:14 - jslint for es6 and JSX in the build or
109:19 - in the atom editor it's probably you
109:23 - could probably do both if you if you
109:25 - want to know was better probably
109:26 - probably both and then that way having
109:31 - it done in the build or on commit would
109:34 - enforce it for other people working on
109:36 - the project but then you would have
109:39 - immediate feedback of how it's supposed
109:41 - to look in your browser or in your
109:43 - editor if you had the editor plugin so I
109:48 - would say if you're only gonna do one I
109:50 - think doing it on on commit or on build
109:53 - is the best if you can only have one but
109:56 - if you can have both and that would be
109:58 - better
110:06 - services that Firefox development
110:08 - browser is pretty good
110:19 - now it looks like David gave Jordan
110:22 - pretty much the same answer in terms of
110:24 - both that are better to have in terms of
110:30 - linting es6 and Rohan said it as well so
110:36 - I sit a read down farther
110:59 - I'm good John said thanks for the answer
111:02 - you're welcome
111:02 - I have Sebastian asked if I fixed the
111:06 - issue with the theme no that definitely
111:13 - didn't fix it so there's a there is a
111:17 - branch now on github that has the mess
111:20 - that I made on it so if anybody really
111:22 - wants to check it out you can but
111:24 - otherwise I think I'm just gonna leave
111:26 - it alone for now and just continue
111:30 - developing with what we had before that
111:32 - actually works on the master branch so
111:35 - all right well I've gotten through
111:37 - everything in the live chat if I miss
111:39 - your question just send it to me on
111:40 - Twitter put it in the comments below
111:42 - thanks so much everyone for all the help
111:45 - really sorry I didn't we didn't actually
111:48 - accomplish anything so it's a lot better
111:51 - I think when we get something
111:52 - accomplished because like we can feel
111:55 - good about that but we did work through
111:58 - a lot of stuff even though it didn't end
112:00 - you know finally and you know us solving
112:03 - the big issues but anyway it was cool we
112:06 - got to dig into a lot of a lot a lot of
112:11 - the node modules and you know a lot of
112:14 - the code base for material UI the beta
112:18 - version so that was kind of cool to see
112:19 - how it all work so maybe it was useful a
112:21 - bit and got to do some stuff with get
112:24 - that I'd never done before so not bad
112:28 - and it was good hanging out with all of
112:31 - you and talking with all the years so I
112:33 - will be back tomorrow should be at the
112:35 - normal time 2 p.m. Eastern time and have
112:41 - a great day I'll see y'all tomorrow
