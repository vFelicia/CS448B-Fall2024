00:01 - flexbox
00:05 - having family here i was also traveling
00:07 - a lot this week
00:12 - monday today was quite productive
00:14 - [Music]
00:44 - checking uh if i can use flexbox uh one
00:47 - of the sources that it's really worth
00:49 - recommending is can i use
00:52 - i always come back to this page when i
00:53 - want to check if
00:55 - you know the feature is already
00:57 - supported and there are always known
00:59 - issues mentioned uh and
01:02 - you see which versions are supported to
01:04 - which extent where there are some
01:07 - problems like partial support due to a
01:10 - large amount of bugs or
01:13 - only supporting a given syntax and
01:16 - what's great also about this page can i
01:18 - use
01:19 - dot com
01:20 - is
01:22 - that you also have
01:24 - resources suggested and here you can
01:26 - find a lot of useful names one of the
01:30 - links that i found here
01:32 - just by you know searching
01:34 - the page uh
01:37 - was this one which is the git repo about
01:40 - known flex packs
01:42 - um
01:44 - this is this one it's uh
01:47 - it's a git repository about uh flexbox
01:50 - issues and cross browsers uh workarounds
01:53 - for them
01:54 - another very useful resource
01:57 - engineering the page that i use very
01:59 - often the css districts and css tricks
02:04 - dot com
02:05 - and on this page there's a complete type
02:07 - of let's go
02:09 - it's getting a lot of images that can
02:11 - help you
02:12 - to
02:13 - get how it works
02:15 - you have also about prefixing flex buffs
02:18 - because
02:20 - you know because of this
02:22 - limited browser support still you have
02:25 - to use uh of the graphics here
02:28 - very often from the comment here in this
02:30 - page in css tricks you can learn
02:33 - a lot it's like a second
02:36 - second pack of information
02:38 - additional to the main article
02:43 - [Music]
02:51 - [Music]
02:55 - so
02:56 - [Music]
03:11 - living in spain you notice how
03:14 - various
03:15 - this land and this you know we're all
03:17 - there so
03:19 - you have the um
03:22 - juxtaposition of
03:24 - something that is really expensive
03:27 - with something that it's
03:29 - really cheap and with people who
03:33 - don't have money to live
03:36 - coding nowadays
03:38 - it can be learned for free that's why i
03:41 - love initiatives such as open source
03:43 - because everybody can use it it's for
03:46 - free so
03:48 - what you need to pay attention to and
03:49 - what you need to pay with is your
03:52 - your time in majority of other branches
03:55 - in order to learn something new you have
03:57 - to pay coding is a bit different so to
03:59 - learn coding or to learn design
04:02 - sure you can go to the school you can go
04:03 - to the university you can pay for the
04:05 - courses you can pay for bootcamps for
04:07 - tutorials and i also use partially these
04:11 - sources but the um
04:14 - tones
04:15 - there are tons of free materials so
04:18 - saying that you don't have money and you
04:20 - want to learn to code is not an excuse
04:22 - what you need to invest is your time and
04:24 - your willingness to learn and being
04:26 - consistent and you know coming back to
04:28 - code coming back to new tutorials
04:30 - looking for the sources reading a lot
04:33 - watching uh subscribing being
04:36 - you know inquisitive and being simply
04:38 - curious when you see a great blog post
04:41 - look what else they write when you bump
04:44 - into a great tutorial look what others
04:46 - you know serious they have on their
04:48 - youtube channel
04:49 - so
04:50 - simply start doing
04:52 - lack of money is not an excuse money
04:54 - helps but you don't have to have it to
04:57 - study you don't have to have
04:59 - extra money to pay for the courses
05:02 - sure you have to have the money to
05:03 - survive and to eat etc but in order to
05:05 - learn
05:06 - damage there are a lot of open source
05:09 - projects which
05:11 - which are for free and there are a lot
05:13 - of groups uh in code community that you
05:16 - can really use if you want to learn
05:18 - coding you can also go to the local
05:19 - meetups you can also visit local groups
05:21 - devoted to the given language you can
05:24 - visit various forums you can learn from
05:27 - youtube tutorials from blogs from medium
05:30 - articles when i started learning to code
05:32 - i discovered that a majority of paid
05:35 - resources have trials and before
05:38 - deciding on any paid course you know
05:42 - the servers you know if it's really
05:43 - worth but also if you don't have enough
05:46 - money to pay for it
05:49 - this tutorial that they give can also
05:51 - give you the basic knowledge that you
05:53 - need if you use these trials that are
05:55 - free
05:56 - from each service still you gain a lot
05:58 - of free material so learning to code you
06:01 - don't need to spend a fortune
06:10 - good day it's wednesday and my article
06:14 - about my first path
06:16 - that i took to le while learning to code
06:19 - has been just published it already has
06:22 - 150
06:24 - upvotes and nine comments so
06:27 - it means that on average more than 10
06:30 - people like this
06:32 - article per hour
06:34 - i will provide the link to this article
06:37 - below in the video description so if you
06:39 - are interested have a look there
06:41 - [Music]
06:50 - as i told you you can really learn for
06:52 - free recently i bumped into flexbox io
06:56 - uh on guitar so if you have eyes open
06:59 - there are really a lot a lot of you know
07:01 - free resources but they're really of a
07:04 - great quality you have to have just only
07:06 - your eyes opened and
07:09 - and look around what's possible and
07:11 - remember that google is your friend
07:18 - trying to build the first step with
07:19 - flexbox i will start with navigation
07:24 - [Music]
07:30 - [Music]
07:37 - [Music]
07:38 - this is the final version of my
07:40 - medication that i was working on
07:44 - textbooks
07:45 - it's like the example to have a bit of
07:48 - practice with flexbox navigation it's
07:51 - pretty responsive
07:54 - it changes
07:55 - according to the
07:57 - width
07:58 - of the viewport
08:04 - [Music]
08:13 - i've just implemented the pricing list
08:15 - with flexbox it's just the desktop right
08:18 - now but this price almost
08:21 - is built
08:23 - with black spots
08:25 - and
08:28 - with sass it's one of my first
08:31 - snippets of code in sas
08:33 - and
08:34 - because of being used to
08:36 - regular css
08:39 - your hand goes to semi colors and
08:42 - graphics
08:43 - in gopher you can do the compiled
08:46 - version so you can do uncompiled sas and
08:49 - compile css in order to compare
08:53 - your checking
08:54 - if everything is
08:56 - compiled correctly later especially if
08:59 - you try sass for the first time
09:02 - and i also used
09:04 - flexbox
09:05 - here
09:07 - for this pricing list it looks like that
09:11 - [Music]
09:22 - one more pen that i've implemented with
09:25 - using effects but from sas is this a
09:27 - single line booking form
09:30 - where you can choose a number of rooms
09:33 - date
09:35 - how many people will beat the room it's
09:38 - like you know simple code snippet uh
09:40 - super culture
09:42 - that
09:43 - may be used for booking
09:45 - their rooms um
09:47 - like conference rooms in a company or
09:49 - something similar i'm using sas here
09:53 - some
09:54 - simple wrapping
09:56 - media queries and
09:59 - also
10:01 - i'm using flexbox
10:05 - let's revise flexbox i got a box here
10:08 - and i will try to
10:10 - revise what i learned with it using this
10:13 - box
10:15 - imagine this is the container this is
10:16 - the div that's gotta display flex this
10:19 - is the div having the display flex
10:23 - we treat it as a parent
10:26 - this is flex row when you change it to
10:28 - flex
10:30 - column so when we go to direction column
10:35 - they will be squeezed
10:42 - this way
10:44 - by default they do not wrap by default
10:47 - the element do not the elements do not
10:49 - wrap
10:50 - so imagine we have more of the elements
10:54 - the simplest option is to say
10:57 - ra and these two extra elements then
11:01 - would be wrapped by default to the next
11:04 - line
11:05 - the default order is zero so whenever we
11:08 - change the order of an item so whenever
11:11 - for example this item number one
11:14 - we'll change the order to one
11:17 - and by default all of them right now
11:18 - have zero it will move here
11:24 - right now it's zero zero one so setting
11:26 - it to
11:27 - -1
11:30 - we move it to the beginning
11:33 - it's pretty useful for um responsive
11:36 - layouts for example when we talk about
11:39 - having the the order different on mobile
11:41 - and different on desktop
11:44 - three elements
11:45 - and they will be justified center
11:48 - they will be simply in the center
11:52 - when we talk about justify content we
11:54 - can also go to flex start and flex and
11:57 - by flex start
11:59 - it means that all of the items
12:02 - will be moved to flex start
12:06 - it's flex direction row so flex started
12:09 - here
12:10 - another justify content is flex and
12:16 - as a result
12:19 - all of the items
12:21 - will go to flex and because this is a
12:24 - flex direction row and this is the end
12:28 - it's good to remember when you get lost
12:30 - where is the main axis so when it's a
12:32 - row is this way so it's a horizontal
12:34 - line and when it's the column when it
12:37 - comes to flex direction is from top to
12:39 - bottom
12:40 - have a look at the description of this
12:42 - video below because you will find there
12:44 - are a lot of useful links in order to
12:46 - learn and practice flexbox
12:49 - it's friday evening and this week this
12:51 - article was also a huge circle
12:53 - motivation for me thanks to christian
12:56 - it's also available right now in chinese
12:57 - you will find the version under this
13:00 - link i got a lot of feedback connected
13:02 - with the article that i wrote
13:04 - and being able to hear so many voices on
13:07 - um my path so far and what could be done
13:10 - differently and what's inspiring for
13:12 - them it was something that made my week
13:15 - this week i've also gathered 12 brownie
13:18 - points for helping other people on
13:20 - together and
13:21 - i got a currently
13:25 - 477 brownie points so i'm missing 23 uh
13:30 - to my 500 points challenge
13:32 - in order to start next
13:34 - level in free code camp one of the
13:36 - biggest problems that i met this week
13:39 - was
13:40 - nesting in flexbox
13:42 - because
13:44 - going into
13:46 - levels of nesting and sometimes can
13:50 - can get tricky and
13:52 - you have to be really careful with that
13:54 - next week i want to work more with
13:56 - flexbox and sas so i want to do some
13:59 - more ui elements we're using them
14:03 - and i want to also discover this grid
14:05 - system because flexbox uh as i read it's
14:08 - like
14:09 - pretty well for smaller components but
14:11 - not necessary for you know huge app
14:13 - layout and it seems to be pretty fun
14:15 - later to build uh
14:17 - the app
14:18 - just using flexbox and grid system and
14:21 - not ready framework because it's like
14:23 - another level for me keep on doing stay
14:26 - motivated and see you next week
