00:00 - hi in this video we are going to talk
00:02 - about variables in code now variables
00:05 - just like in algebra is when you have a
00:07 - letter or a name or a word or something
00:10 - and that represents something else so
00:12 - here we're going to say ver x equals
00:15 - bana which is a string you can tell it
00:17 - has letters and is in quotations their x
00:20 - equals Briana so if we reference X later
00:22 - on it's going to know that means bana so
00:25 - if we console log X what that would
00:28 - print was just Bana but there is
00:31 - something to be careful about here if
00:32 - you put console log X in the quotation
00:36 - mark that's going to read that as
00:37 - another string and just print the letter
00:39 - X so this is a really simple example but
00:42 - what I want you to take away from this
00:44 - video is variables exist in code and you
00:47 - can store simple things like a string
00:49 - all the way up to more complicated
00:52 - things like a function just with a
00:54 - simple
00:55 - name all right here we have the console
00:57 - up again let's just show some examples
01:01 - of variables in code so we're gonna say
01:03 - ver x equals
01:07 - Briana and you'll notice some you know
01:10 - JavaScript syntax that you'll get to
01:12 - know more later we'll say ver y equals
01:16 - cheese and if we decide to go
01:21 - console.log and in here we say X Y I
01:25 - want you to think about what you think
01:26 - that's going to say uh what you think
01:29 - that's going to look like down here
01:30 - remember it's not going to be in here
01:31 - like when you do the bonfires it's going
01:32 - to be down here it just says Briana
01:34 - cheese very good because we had X and Y
01:37 - bana and cheese but we can add some more
01:40 - things in here if we want to console log
01:41 - a string do likes and then we separate
01:44 - it with commas let's see what that does
01:46 - it says Rihanna likes cheese very good
01:49 - now again remember you can have the
01:50 - streams you can have the booleans which
01:52 - are true false or you can have just
01:54 - numbers um really remember this lesson
01:57 - is all about the variables we can change
01:59 - up here here we can say um Chris if we
02:04 - change that do you think it's going to
02:05 - continue to console Briana nope it knows
02:08 - it references back up and knows that X
02:10 - now equals Chris so it says Chris likes
02:11 - cheese
