00:06 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:08 - with Jesse I'm Jesse and today we're
00:12 - gonna take some of that data that we
00:14 - moved from sequel server into my sequel
00:18 - via the WordPress API and we're going to
00:21 - take that data now out of WordPress with
00:24 - graph QL into our react next j/s
00:30 - applications so first thing we have to
00:33 - do well I already did the first thing
00:36 - before the stream so I just installed
00:38 - the latest version of the WP graph QL
00:41 - plug-in onto WordPress so just a quick
00:45 - recap of how I did that it's in case
00:48 - you're you know following along or what
00:50 - do you use this for your own project I
00:51 - just went to the WP graph QL I don't
00:56 - think I have it up anymore I went to
00:59 - their github page and then I went to
01:06 - releases I guess I can bring it up just
01:09 - to show y'all
01:18 - there we go okay so when you go we know
01:27 - to get up repo you can check the
01:28 - releases so I clicked on releases I
01:31 - downloaded this zip file of the latest
01:34 - release and then I just went into the
01:38 - plugins add new plug-in upload and then
01:43 - I uploaded that zip file alright that's
01:45 - it it's as simple as that
01:47 - activated that after you do that you do
01:49 - need to flush your what do they call it
01:53 - your permalinks so the way I do it is I
01:58 - just click on one of these buttons and
02:00 - then I click back I save it and I click
02:02 - on another one of those buttons and that
02:04 - flushes it for me they may be a better
02:07 - way to do that but I don't know but if
02:09 - you skip that step it's not gonna work
02:12 - you're not gonna get any data from that
02:14 - graph qo endpoint but assuming you did
02:16 - that now if you just type in your so
02:20 - this is graph graph eql I'm not sure how
02:23 - to pronounce that but you can get it as
02:25 - a Chrome extension you just put in your
02:28 - URL which in our case now is it's just
02:31 - an IP address and then put graph QL at
02:34 - the end a slash graph key well and you
02:36 - should be able to get some data so right
02:37 - now I'm just testing it and I'm grabbing
02:40 - the IDS of all of our posts okay so that
02:44 - part is pretty easy but here's the the
02:46 - problem that we had it's not really a
02:49 - problem it's just an extra step we have
02:51 - to do so that post type that we made in
02:55 - our last stream faculty I'm gonna try to
02:59 - get data from that and it says it can't
03:02 - find the field faculty all right so we
03:05 - have to add something else to our plugin
03:09 - our custom post types plug-in to make
03:13 - this work so here's our faculty custom
03:17 - post type and you can see down here we
03:21 - say show and rest in the rest api and
03:23 - that's how we got it to show up
03:25 - obviously in our REST API but
03:29 - what we need to do now is we need to get
03:34 - it to show up in graph QL as well so
03:40 - we're gonna go graph oops sorry show in
03:53 - graph QL actually let me start my let me
03:58 - start my Pomodoro timer since we're kind
04:00 - of getting into it right away okay I
04:07 - just checked the latch at hey everybody
04:09 - and Brooks says is it graph graph e cool
04:13 - like graphical but cooler I don't know
04:16 - that maybe that's how you pronounce it I
04:18 - just I've never heard it always just
04:20 - seen it alright here we go let's start
04:24 - our Pomodoro timer we're going to get
04:25 - into Pomodoro sessions today I have a
04:28 - Christmas party for my department here
04:31 - in about an hour and a half a little
04:34 - less than an hour and a half so we'll
04:36 - see what we much we can get done
04:41 - let's see graph
04:45 - kilo graph kilo and we also hoops a
04:49 - skipped as for label
05:07 - we need to add a label as well
05:18 - I think we do 30p graphical poser custom
05:25 - feels I'm gonna try to get away with not
05:28 - adding the label so I have some
05:34 - documentation open here this is from the
05:36 - graph graph WP graph QL wiki and it's
05:44 - saying to put in this label but I I
05:50 - don't know that much about this but it
05:53 - seems to me like I might not have to add
05:55 - this label so I'm gonna try to get away
05:57 - without it and see if it works all right
06:03 - so let me all right so we're gonna show
06:09 - in graph QL and then we're gonna do this
06:12 - little arrow thing I'm not sure what
06:15 - they call that in in PHP but looks like
06:19 - an arrow function to me coming from
06:21 - JavaScript land so we're gonna say true
06:24 - and then graph qo single name we're
06:35 - gonna give it faculty and then we're
06:41 - just gonna say faculty again I guess if
06:47 - I really wanted to for singular we could
06:50 - do like faculty member but I think it'll
06:53 - be fine
06:54 - so plural plural name okay so let's see
07:02 - public sure we make sure I have
07:05 - everything the way it should be okay
07:08 - that looks good and then also if we want
07:11 - to get that custom taxonomy working we
07:16 - need to add some things in there as well
07:18 - so right now our custom taxonomy we have
07:23 - said show and rest so we need to do
07:25 - pretty much the same thing so I'm just
07:28 - going to copy and paste since we've
07:29 - we've done it already
07:37 - and instead of genre we're gonna do
07:44 - faculty department for singular and then
07:56 - departments for plural I'm gonna save
08:01 - that hopefully that's all we need to do
08:09 - it's worth a try at this point to see if
08:12 - it works so we do need to copy all of
08:17 - that and then add it in here to our
08:20 - plugin so we'll go to our plugin editor
08:23 - and let's go to what the plugin that we
08:29 - made paste that in update it and let's
08:37 - see hopefully I don't have to flush the
08:41 - permalinks again we'll see if it works
08:43 - like this if it doesn't then we'll flush
08:45 - the permalinks it was a Oh
08:50 - internal server error that is not good
08:59 - Wow so we're not getting anything hmm
09:06 - all right let's check this out I mean
09:14 - we're still able to move around here
09:16 - let's go let's let's flush our
09:20 - permalinks
09:27 - see if that makes a difference
09:41 - all right so evidently I messed
09:43 - something up
09:46 - we shouldn't be surprising I do that
09:48 - quite a bit also the stream is a little
09:56 - bit earlier today so I can see I have a
09:58 - lot less people going to normally have
10:00 - let me know what you think about this
10:02 - time though for a stream so I mean the
10:07 - other time that we do this in the
10:09 - afternoon well for me the afternoon is
10:11 - okay with me but you know I'm interested
10:15 - in seeing what time works better for you
10:16 - also let me know either in a live chat
10:19 - now or in the comments later on if a an
10:22 - 11:30 a.m. time is okay it it goes over
10:27 - top of my lunch break but to be honest
10:30 - with you I usually end up working
10:31 - through my lunch break anyway so it
10:35 - wouldn't be a big deal for me to stream
10:37 - at this time if that ends up being a
10:40 - better time for everyone
10:41 - I can maybe try it out and just stream
10:45 - at this sum of a few days and then at
10:48 - the normal time a few other days a week
10:49 - just to see you know how many people end
10:52 - up watching hmm
10:55 - I'm interested to see now okay so our
10:59 - REST API is still working let's make
11:03 - sure it's working here okay so the REST
11:07 - API works maybe I do all right let's
11:14 - take a look at what I did and perhaps I
11:18 - I had it in an error well that's if it
11:24 - was a syntax error in the plug-in then
11:28 - we would get a much worse result
11:31 - immediately right so we still have this
11:34 - here so it's probably not a syntax error
11:38 - but maybe I missed something so I'm
11:42 - gonna bring this documentation back over
11:45 - and we can look at it together
11:52 - so okay we've done that we've added
12:01 - those three attributes so these three
12:05 - are the ones that are important and
12:11 - we've also added them for the taxonomy
12:36 - I'm not really sure what this is doing
12:40 - or whether or not I need it let me
12:48 - scroll up and see what else we have here
13:13 - shushing
13:25 - okay so these look like it's four fields
13:28 - which I'm not worried about the fields
13:32 - yet
13:40 - but this is good to know that if we want
13:42 - to add custom fields we can do that
13:59 - yeah I don't think that first part is
14:03 - what we're really going for right now
14:06 - let me look more closely yeah really the
14:11 - only thing that I didn't do was add this
14:16 - in with the label see my labels look
14:19 - different than their labels let's go
14:28 - back and check what we have here so yeah
14:30 - our labels were actually we've created a
14:32 - variable labels and we have you know
14:34 - quite a bit in here so let's compare
14:48 - so I mean we have faculty right
14:51 - [Music]
14:59 - she's
15:16 - all right let me check the live chat and
15:18 - see oh hey Jason's here alright awesome
15:22 - I'm really glad so jason created WP
15:26 - graph QL the plugin so I'm really glad
15:28 - that you that you came I um I was hoping
15:32 - that you might you know stop in for a
15:34 - bit so Jason I have the latest version
15:38 - of WP graph QL installed in in WordPress
15:44 - here so it's I think it's point 2 2 and
15:47 - right now I've I've added in I'll show
15:52 - you here so I've added in the show and
15:56 - graph QL graph QL names right here for
16:00 - the post type and then also for the
16:02 - taxonomy but now I am getting an error
16:12 - so when I try to get anything from graph
16:16 - QL now well let's just try post again so
16:19 - before when I try to get posts it worked
16:22 - now I'm getting internal server error
16:26 - what I'm really trying to get is faculty
16:29 - and that's a custom post type so this is
16:36 - the message I'm getting so I messed
16:39 - something up and I'll leave I'll leave
16:44 - this code up here with it we that we had
16:49 - let me make that a bit bigger so anyway
16:57 - so if you have any ideas about what I'm
17:03 - doing wrong or anything let me know I
17:05 - did use a show again what was I using I
17:10 - was using the graph QL wiki page on
17:16 - extending and customizing so that's
17:20 - where I was going off of to do this
17:26 - okay Jason is gonna try to get a snippet
17:31 - for us thank you I appreciate it
17:43 - okay so while we're waiting on that I'm
17:46 - gonna check out what's in the live chat
17:48 - as well here so it looks like it's not
17:52 - it's not a bad time this so I asked
17:56 - earlier about this time whether this
17:58 - would work for everyone and seems like
18:02 - the time is okay
18:17 - all right so Jason's asking if the
18:20 - faculty post type shows up in the admin
18:22 - panel and it does so we have it here I'm
18:28 - gonna refresh everything yep yeah so the
18:31 - faculty post type does show up
18:54 - okay it looks like so far I'm seeing all
18:58 - positive response to streaming at this
19:03 - time so yeah maybe I'll try it out I
19:07 - think I said we have it's still lower
19:09 - than normal viewers but that could
19:11 - definitely be because I I scheduled the
19:14 - stream you know kind of later like
19:18 - pretty close to when the stream is
19:19 - actually going to start and every time I
19:21 - do that I always have less viewers I
19:24 - think at least for some people there's
19:27 - no notification usually there's like a
19:30 - warning notification of the streams
19:32 - going to start I'm gonna check to see if
19:34 - I got it
19:35 - yeah see I only got the notification
19:38 - saying the stream is live I didn't get
19:40 - the other one that I'd normally get
19:42 - saying the stream is going to start in
19:44 - 30 minutes alright okay cool and Jason
19:52 - has a snippet coming all right I need to
19:58 - keep an eye on my time as well so don't
20:02 - miss my Christmas party I had I was
20:04 - already late to one meeting this morning
20:06 - it snowed a lot here I mean a lot for my
20:10 - area if you live you know farther north
20:13 - than me it probably wouldn't seem like a
20:14 - lot but I think it was maybe like two
20:18 - inches overnight so anyway the kids had
20:22 - a delay for school so it kind of threw
20:26 - everything off this morning and I got in
20:28 - a little bit later than I normally would
20:32 - for my meeting so I don't want to be
20:33 - late for two things in one day
20:45 - all right let me we also have okay so
20:57 - the the sights the react site the next
21:04 - yeah site that we're working on have
21:06 - some updates so hard went in and
21:08 - and hooked up Apollo so that we can use
21:12 - graph QL and pull the data in so you can
21:15 - check out in the package.json I have up
21:17 - here you can see there's a lot of new
21:18 - things so make sure if if you've already
21:21 - cloned this repo definitely do a get
21:24 - pool I just added in yesterday I did
21:29 - pull in those changes so I merged that
21:34 - request so check that out so I mean
21:38 - we'll be using it and going over it a
21:41 - little bit more once we get graph QL
21:44 - working here so I guess you can you can
21:51 - check that out while we're trying to fix
21:53 - this if you want okay won't let Jason
21:57 - paste the code in the live chat let's
22:00 - see Jason do you think yeah a harsh
22:06 - desist try paste paste mental work if
22:08 - you can paste it in a direct message on
22:11 - Twitter that would work too whatever is
22:13 - whatever is easier for you I think we do
22:17 - have we do have this as a as a git repo
22:25 - it's a public git repo so you could
22:28 - paste it in an issue if you wanted I
22:29 - mean really any whatever is the easiest
22:32 - way for you to get it to me is it's fine
22:35 - with me
22:46 - all right awesome so Jason has put it
22:51 - into a gist and I'm gonna check that out
22:54 - right now
23:07 - alright awesome let me pull this over to
23:12 - this screen so we can just check it out
23:17 - okay so
23:38 - all right let's see
23:51 - okay so we action
24:08 - okay so I would replace
24:37 - absolutely didn't have the
24:46 - okay so Jason was saying it might have
24:51 - been an issue with having the graph QL
24:53 - single and plural names the same but
24:58 - actually it looks like it works Jason
25:01 - say not sure what the difference between
25:03 - my snippet and yours is alright let's
25:05 - check it out let's check it out again
25:14 - like the only thing custom fields is
25:20 - included here I don't see what that
25:21 - would have to do with anything the would
25:29 - are there any issues with me having near
25:33 - the rest api activated as well I saw
25:38 - with the last route
25:41 - yeah with the last release there was a
25:45 - note about a conflict on custom post
25:50 - types that have registered show and rest
25:53 - true so it does say that version 2 to
25:58 - our zero point zero point two two fixes
26:01 - that I mean I could try to take this out
26:07 - let's try to take this out and see and
26:11 - we'll try to take it out here as well
26:21 - take it out so we've taken out all the
26:25 - rest stuff here which if we're going to
26:31 - use the REST API to pull in data we're
26:35 - gonna have to put that back in but at
26:38 - least you know we'll test this out and
26:40 - see if if that was an issue oh yeah okay
26:51 - so let's go back to our plugins to the
26:54 - editor and we'll update that right now
27:10 - let's check this out hmm
27:15 - so still getting the error there let me
27:19 - try the permalinks thing here again
27:34 - mmm still an error just to make sure I'm
27:39 - trying to I'm getting the right thing
27:41 - here
27:46 - yeah we should be able to get those Oh
27:51 - what is this whoops
28:02 - alright let me check
28:11 - okay Jason says the show and wrestling
28:14 - is working for for him so alright let me
28:19 - let me just leave that back in there
28:22 - since we'll probably need that at some
28:25 - point anyway
28:42 - okay harsh it says open the console to
28:45 - see if there's an error in here for the
28:48 - request okay yeah we have errors for
28:52 - sure
29:04 - yeah
29:07 - so it's giving us a 500 internal
29:20 - okay so it's it's saying the graph QL
29:24 - requests must be a post or get request
29:27 - with a valid query alright so let's try
29:37 - hard refresh then
29:54 - hmm so we're not we're not getting any
29:56 - schema
30:14 - oops my the timer went off let me do it
30:18 - sure I think I'm all caught up in the
30:20 - live chat let me double check but I
30:22 - think we can just kind of keep going
30:43 - okay yeah I've gone over everything live
30:47 - chat so I'm just gonna start another
30:48 - Pomodoro Pomodoro session here all right
31:00 - all right let's try got some some things
31:04 - that were being put in the in the chat
31:07 - for me to try
31:15 - okay still getting that internal server
31:18 - error can you share a link of the WP
31:22 - install yeah the the wordpress install
31:26 - let me give you the link here I mean
31:29 - it's just an IP address but there it is
31:31 - in the in the live chat now okay so I'm
31:43 - gonna take the snippet where to go
31:52 - now I can't find too many things open
32:01 - all right let's get rid of that I get
32:06 - rid of that for now
32:21 - there it is all right yeah so I'm gonna
32:24 - copy this and let's yeah let's just put
32:34 - this in here and then I'll take this and
32:49 - comment this out
33:01 - there we go
33:08 - jace setup I'm like five minutes behind
33:11 - on the stream that is that's a lot of a
33:17 - lot behind I don't think I can do about
33:22 - it now I usually do set it to low
33:24 - latency so there's not that much of a
33:28 - difference between what I'm saying and
33:31 - when you all hear it let's see all right
33:43 - so I'm just gonna try this and you know
33:48 - what let me let me get rid of this for
33:55 - now it's just in case that's messing
34:01 - things up
34:36 - okay so no more air so we have our post
34:38 - again let's see if we can get faculty
34:47 - what would we have as faculty members
34:50 - yeah
35:07 - oops I spelled it wrong yeah alright so
35:13 - we have faculty members now okay so that
35:16 - works so there's something in and what
35:19 - I'm doing what I was doing that was
35:21 - messing this up so
35:40 - this weird
35:46 - well alright I think we can figure this
35:49 - out alright so I guess what we can do it
36:00 - this is going to be kind of tedious so I
36:02 - apologize for this but I don't know that
36:08 - there's much sense in trying to move
36:09 - forward until we make sure that this is
36:12 - gonna work you know with everything that
36:17 - we need so I'm gonna take basically I'm
36:22 - gonna paste in these different things
36:27 - let me see you know what let's try this
36:30 - first all right so let's see if we can
36:37 - get this taxonomy in here so basically
36:43 - we're gonna slowly put paste these
36:45 - things back in here and until we get an
36:48 - error and then we should be able to find
36:49 - out what exactly is causing the error so
36:56 - this is going to be tedious just because
36:58 - of the way I'm updating this plugin
37:06 - which I wonder like actually I could do
37:13 - this in a way that would be easier but
37:16 - I'd have to set that up as well and at
37:20 - this point I don't think it would be
37:22 - worth it to take the time to do it right
37:24 - now but at some point maybe it would be
37:34 - alright let's update that and check it
37:41 - alright so we did get the internal
37:43 - server error and all we added back in
37:47 - was the stuff with this taxonomy alright
37:54 - so you know what I'm gonna try let's
37:56 - take this out
37:58 - and I'm going to departments
38:15 - I'm going to take that out so basically
38:17 - this is going to be
38:27 - everything that we originally had for
38:32 - our post types I'm adding all this back
38:35 - in but I'm taking out this part that we
38:37 - know caused an error so we'll see we'll
38:43 - see how this goes now
39:00 - okay so the air is gone but we can't
39:03 - find faculty members and that's because
39:05 - we named it something different so
39:08 - faculty okay great all right so this is
39:12 - good this and this took a lot less time
39:14 - than I thought so all of this worked
39:17 - right so just adding the show and graph
39:20 - QL stuff to what we had for the post
39:22 - type works but for whatever reason
39:25 - something we did here with the taxonomy
39:28 - did not work so for now I guess we can
39:37 - we can move on for now and get this data
39:43 - in here yeah I said let's see what let's
39:52 - see what else we can get I want to be
39:56 - able to see is there a way I can get all
40:02 - the fields that are available here I
40:05 - don't know enough about this syntax
40:21 - you can do like that no it's not gonna
40:25 - work
40:25 - all right so let's do the ID title to
40:35 - recall a department all right so we
40:39 - don't have that field I could see oh
40:53 - okay all right sorry Jason I I wasn't
40:56 - looking at the live chat so jason says
41:00 - you can't have special characters like
41:02 - faculty - departments so I'd have to
41:04 - camelcase it awesome
41:18 - okay
41:22 - baby is so harsh it says the wp install
41:28 - is redirecting this is what I get when I
41:33 - mean obviously it shouldn't really show
41:35 - anything okay
41:42 - let's refresh alright great we've got
41:49 - the schema now and it's hype ahead as
41:53 - you read queries great all right so
41:56 - let's let's go ahead and add in our what
42:02 - we needed here for or is that here we go
42:10 - so I'm gonna grab these again and this
42:14 - time oops let's see if I can get it
42:22 - right so I should be able to do this and
42:25 - then change it to faculty departments
42:39 - oops
42:40 - supposed to be Department right whoops
42:49 - there we go faculty department faculty
42:52 - okay great all right let's try this out
42:57 - now
43:19 - see if we get it no the shadow refresh
43:44 - okay all right let's see
43:55 - with the ID let's see if we can get the
43:57 - title can we get this name yeah see oh
44:06 - nice
44:07 - alright check that out okay so this is
44:12 - what we're getting now so we get all our
44:15 - faculty members alright so right now I'm
44:17 - I'm not getting all the data we need but
44:19 - we have the title and then we have on
44:24 - our faculty departments and we have the
44:29 - idea which we won't really need but we
44:31 - can get the name of that faculty
44:33 - department it's awesome awesome awesome
44:39 - this is great and actually that's thanks
44:43 - for mentioning like the reloading this
44:45 - to get the schema because this
44:47 - type-ahead you all probably can see it
44:50 - is too small but you know being able to
44:52 - go in here and type in you know
44:55 - something like this I can immediately
44:57 - see you know what what's available to me
45:03 - so I mean that's that's really useful I
45:12 - just want to see what has four count
45:15 - seven seven nice the count might be
45:19 - useful at some point really cool all
45:28 - right all right see much time we have
45:33 - okay we're not bad on time can
45:35 - definitely finish out this Pomodoro
45:37 - cycle and right now there's not a whole
45:40 - lot in the live chat that I haven't
45:42 - already addressed so maybe I don't know
45:47 - if we can do a whole nother Pomodoro a
45:48 - cycle but maybe so we'll see so let's go
45:54 - in now and let's try to pool some of
45:57 - this data in let's see how we're gonna
46:00 - do okay so we'll make a page first and
46:05 - Paige will have parameterised routing
46:09 - we've done this before in previous
46:11 - streams so we'll have some parameterised
46:13 - routing and then if they go to the page
46:18 - we should see what this is like let's
46:21 - check the current site I'm jumping all
46:25 - over the place sorry about this so I'm
46:27 - going to check the current site to see
46:28 - what the URL is or jason says my
46:32 - connection is saw it sorry I wasn't able
46:34 - to help more but I'm not really able to
46:36 - even follow us oh no problem Jason you
46:38 - you are super helpful there's no way I
46:41 - would have made it we'll figure that out
46:42 - on my own about the having a camel case
46:44 - things so super super helpful thank you
46:47 - so much
46:52 - alright so I want to check the current
46:55 - site to see what the URLs are for the
46:59 - faculty page if I can match that URL
47:02 - that would be awesome then users who
47:05 - have something bookmarked or any links
47:09 - you know from elsewhere that are trying
47:11 - to link to that page they won't break so
47:14 - let's check that out first and I don't
47:17 - really even know how to get to there
47:18 - let's see Department all right let's try
47:26 - departments first and we'll just take
47:31 - biology so we did import the biology
47:34 - professors so let's see faculty and
47:43 - let's read more I actually know this
47:46 - doctor dr. Oskie he's a super nice guy I
47:51 - played Lord of the Rings Trivial Pursuit
47:55 - at his house before and his wife is
47:59 - super super knowledgeable about Tolkien
48:02 - stuff and she actually beat me and so I
48:08 - was really impressed but they're really
48:09 - nice people so it looks like this is
48:14 - going to be perfect so I don't know if
48:16 - you can see the URL through
48:18 - small.i there we go hopefully you can
48:23 - see that better now but it's just slash
48:26 - faculty slash and then the the name so
48:29 - it's jurasky slash there so it's last
48:32 - name and then first name see i can get
48:36 - that we got to figure out a way to to
48:47 - get that last name first name in there
48:53 - just right now we have that's going to
48:57 - be the toughest part because i don't
49:00 - have i don't think we have a piece of
49:01 - data with that slug but let's let's see
49:04 - if we can find it I'm really glad we
49:07 - looked at this first let's go back to
49:12 - let's go back to the Microsoft sequel
49:17 - whatever this is called sequel operation
49:20 - studio that I always forget what it is
49:23 - so I want to go back and find all the
49:26 - fields again so I can look through and
49:29 - see if we can we have that data in any
49:31 - of the fields
49:41 - alright let me check this
49:56 - okay so something's up with the stream
49:59 - the stream is smearing that webpage
50:02 - looks like a window crashed in Windows
50:04 - XP and you moved it alright so maybe the
50:07 - zoom probably on the wrong Network right
50:11 - no no all right all right listen I'm
50:19 - gonna change networks really quick so
50:21 - the stream is gonna drop off and then
50:23 - start up again so I'm warning everybody
50:25 - now that this is gonna happen so it's
50:28 - just going to be a just a second I need
50:33 - to just set this other network is my
50:35 - default Network from now on since I need
50:37 - it to work on it all right
50:40 - so I'm gonna do it okay so the stream
50:48 - should be back up so let me run this
50:54 - again come on
51:09 - my
51:25 - try to disconnect and reconnect
51:42 - all right let me copy this
51:54 - there we go oh all right okay so looks
52:03 - like alright I'm back we still have the
52:06 - same amount of viewers we have any left
52:08 - so that was a lot better than last time
52:10 - we lost half the viewers when I switch
52:14 - networks okay it's actually really good
52:17 - to know you can switch networks in the
52:18 - middle of a stream and it still picks
52:21 - right back up that's kind of cool
52:23 - all right so here's what we're looking
52:25 - for some data that has the last name of
52:31 - the professor and a hyphen and then
52:33 - first name you would think it would be
52:35 - in here right let's see if not this
52:42 - might be something that needs to be
52:43 - manually put in and hopefully we can
52:48 - figure out some way no it's not in here
53:00 - that's not good that's not good at all
53:11 - all right let's check
53:17 - let's check the data that we have now
53:20 - and see if it's in here somewhere
53:50 - you know I don't see it in there
53:58 - okay blue day says hello hey hey how's
54:04 - it going thanks for watching Harshit
54:06 - says Queen you give me an example slug
54:08 - alright so let's see what are our slugs
54:11 - right now
54:14 - okay so right now we're impress is just
54:17 - making the slugs like McKenna
54:19 - dr. Kyle right so it's adding that
54:22 - doctor in there because of the way it's
54:25 - it's in here we don't want that we want
54:33 - it just to be let me double check
54:36 - actually so Derek Duras key is Duras key
54:40 - - Derek right so let me so even though
54:46 - the name that shows here and that we're
54:50 - pulling as the title into WordPress is
54:53 - dr. Derek jurasky the slug is just Eric
54:56 - - röszke so I'm gonna paste that and you
54:58 - can see in the live chat now let's find
55:04 - another professor so let's see Kyle
55:08 - McKenna and make sure yeah McKenna Kyle
55:14 - okay so yes it's definitely different so
55:18 - I guess here's what we can do this might
55:21 - not be bad for most of these it seems
55:25 - like if they have doctor it'll change
55:30 - let's see what this one since this is a
55:31 - priest let's see what the name ends up
55:33 - alright so even for a priest is still
55:35 - you learning - okay last and first name
55:38 - so what if we just wrote some function
55:43 - that checked and if it had a doctor in
55:46 - it it stripped that out wolf it had
55:49 - fathers ofr period or tio R which mean
55:53 - it's third order regular that's the the
55:56 - order of Franciscans that that run this
55:59 - University we could strip that out maybe
56:06 - we can do that yeah maybe we can do that
56:11 - in our in our migrate Jas file yeah I'm
56:22 - thinking we do that in the migrate Jas
56:23 - file and then pull in see if we can
56:29 - actually add slug like a custom slug
56:33 - here which we should be able to check
56:36 - and here see if we can add it
56:44 - so here's we create a post yeah we can
56:46 - add a slug so we can make a custom slug
56:49 - which can just be our last name and
56:54 - first name but what we'll do is we'll
56:56 - pull out any commas and we'll pull out
56:59 - doctor or any titles like that and we'll
57:02 - make sure we'll insert a - and we'll
57:04 - lowercase everything
57:30 - see
57:33 - okay heart should just put in some
57:36 - things to split this so I think I might
57:39 - be mistaken but I think we need to go
57:42 - the other way so what I have is is this
57:47 - so I have this as a string what I want
57:51 - to get is the slug Duras key - Derek all
57:56 - lowercase without the doctor so yeah so
58:01 - I need to go the other way that's what
58:04 - I'm thinking so regular expressions then
58:07 - and rook and Hart shooters are talking
58:10 - about regular expressions in the live
58:12 - chat yeah that's going to be the way to
58:13 - go let's let's see what I can do now
58:20 - actually my timer ran out so let me
58:23 - check what time it is it's not too bad
58:31 - on time right now let me double check to
58:36 - make sure I didn't get any messages that
58:38 - need my attention before the party slack
58:41 - there's nothing in slack and there's
58:44 - nothing in my email okay so I should be
58:46 - good to work on this well let me I'll
58:51 - leave it up to you all so here's what
58:54 - I'm thinking we could do I could
58:55 - manually change the slug on some of them
58:57 - and then go forward with trying to
58:59 - actually pull the data in or we could
59:04 - wait till tomorrow when we can actually
59:07 - get the regular expressions or Harshit
59:10 - is is going to work on writing a regular
59:12 - expression when we can actually pull
59:14 - this data and we'll probably delete what
59:16 - we have and then pull the data and again
59:18 - with the correct slug that'll be the
59:22 - fastest way to do it and then we can go
59:25 - ahead and create our template for the
59:30 - faculty you know our page and basically
59:33 - use it so that the URL will be the same
59:38 - as it is in the current site where I
59:40 - just lost it words yeah so the URL will
59:43 - be the same as we have in the current
59:44 - site it'll be
59:46 - you know a Franciscan dot edu slash
59:48 - faculty slash and then faculty lastname
59:51 - firstname and then based on that slug
59:56 - that faculty lastname firstname then
59:58 - it'll get the data for that particularly
60:02 - fact particular faculty member C so
60:13 - anyway so that's the two choices could
60:15 - should we just use some manual test data
60:19 - and keep going or should we just say
60:21 - forget it let's just wait till tomorrow
60:23 - when we can have all the real data so
60:27 - I'll wait for some responses here and
60:30 - while I'm doing that I just want to
60:31 - check out what we have here already and
60:34 - our pages so we do have a faculty page
60:38 - already and
60:49 - let's find our survey s faculty okay so
61:02 - we have it set up already great that's
61:06 - great so we have the parameterize
61:08 - routing set up already so if you can let
61:11 - me a lost it here we go so already when
61:14 - it's slash faculty slash and then this
61:16 - is going to be ID this we're calling it
61:19 - ID but we know that's it's going to be
61:21 - the slug we're gonna send the slug there
61:27 - and we're gonna be able to access this
61:32 - ID at that page so let's go back to our
61:35 - faculty component and this query this ID
61:39 - will get saved into props now what we'll
61:45 - do is in this within this get initial
61:54 - props we're gonna actually grab the data
61:56 - so right now we're just returning the ID
61:58 - but what we'll do is like we did on
62:02 - project one the catechetical Institute
62:04 - project here in this get initial props
62:07 - function that's where we're going to get
62:11 - the data and this will run server side
62:15 - as well
62:16 - so this will work with our server-side
62:19 - rendering and then based on the data we
62:21 - return then we can fill out the fields
62:25 - here so this is actually gonna have for
62:35 - now I'm going to leave this as ID but
62:36 - really this will be the title so what
62:41 - we'll have is that title we're gonna
62:43 - have an image and then we'll have some
62:45 - some text here so I mean really this
62:49 - page is pretty it's it's going to be
62:53 - somewhat close to what we what we want
62:57 - but first let's let's just do kind of
63:03 - like a demo here what's what it's gonna
63:04 - be like so right now here's the local
63:07 - version of this and I'm gonna go faculty
63:11 - and then let's go to Ross key Derek
63:16 - great see so Duras key Derek will be
63:19 - able to access that and then use this
63:22 - slug to access the the data so in graph
63:28 - QL it would be
63:35 - we essentially we would search by slug I
63:39 - guess faculty I remember how I did this
63:47 - originally but essentially here it would
63:51 - be where slug why is it not giving me
64:04 - slow
64:16 - we're faculty
64:29 - I don't remember I got it before but
64:32 - basically it'll be like where the slug
64:34 - for this faculty equals and then
64:39 - whatever the value of that idea is so
64:41 - that would end up being you know how we
64:43 - get that data we pass in that ID and
64:48 - then we pull it out which I can't
64:50 - remember I can't remember how we did
64:54 - that I'll have to check and see how
64:55 - we're already doing that in that were
64:58 - doing that in the bulletin the react
65:01 - version of the bulletin we're doing a
65:03 - similar thing so I can just check that
65:05 - code out and github and I'm gonna do the
65:09 - same thing that we were doing before
65:14 - kiss your ass
65:16 - hi should i watch the whole series from
65:18 - the beginning to get along I wouldn't
65:21 - try to watch the whole series from the
65:22 - beginning I think we're well over a
65:24 - hundred videos now it would take a
65:26 - really long time
65:28 - but maybe to get up to date as soon as
65:32 - you can on on this particular project
65:34 - maybe just watch all the videos that are
65:37 - labeled with project five so if you go
65:41 - back to like project five day one and I
65:44 - think this is day 12 that'll be a lot
65:46 - easier to catch up and then if I make
65:48 - reference to some earlier project and
65:50 - you want to you know catch up on that
65:52 - you could certainly try to go back to
65:54 - you know watch you know a video or two
65:57 - from a previous project but I wouldn't
66:10 - unless you have the time I wouldn't
66:14 - worry about needing to watch every video
66:17 - just maybe if you see a topic that that
66:20 - interests you that you want to know more
66:21 - about you know check that out but
66:25 - otherwise it is it would take quite a
66:27 - while all right
66:32 - okay well I think at this point then
66:37 - I think we'll end this this dream and
66:43 - tomorrow will be kind of like part two
66:46 - so we didn't we didn't actually get to
66:51 - the point where we're pulling this data
66:52 - into react but we are able to pull it
66:55 - out of WordPress so we've got the first
67:01 - part done the second part will be
67:03 - getting the data into react and we
67:07 - already have it set up we have our
67:09 - parameterize drowning setup as we just
67:11 - saw you know that works
67:13 - it's just now we'll have to make sure
67:15 - that we we call within this get initial
67:20 - props function we're gonna pass through
67:25 - that slug and get the correct data and
67:29 - then we can populate this so that's what
67:31 - we'll work on tomorrow and we may even
67:35 - pull in the data from our sequel server
67:38 - database into WordPress a little
67:40 - differently so we have correct slugs
67:44 - that's something I might work on you
67:48 - know kind of earlier in the stream we'll
67:51 - see how it goes but I think tomorrow I'm
67:55 - gonna check my calendar just to be sure
67:58 - that I'll be able to stream tomorrow
68:04 - yeah I don't have any meetings on my
68:07 - calendar tomorrow so I should be able to
68:08 - stream I don't know about I might try
68:15 - doing it at like the normal time that I
68:18 - usually stream tomorrow and just see the
68:20 - difference and in viewers but yeah but
68:27 - that's it that's it for today so it
68:29 - didn't get everything done that I
68:30 - thought it was kind of an ambitious
68:32 - project for one stream especially a
68:34 - stream where I knew I had to end you
68:38 - know somewhat you know if I could have
68:41 - taken another hour I think we could
68:42 - definitely could get it done but anyway
68:46 - still we made good progress so even
68:48 - overcame some
68:49 - some issues that were mainly just based
68:51 - on you know the fact that we had the
68:54 - camel case things in our plug-in let's
68:59 - see
68:59 - boxing expert says good job Jesse it
69:02 - takes true will to be doing this every
69:05 - day thanks I appreciate that and then
69:07 - thanks for watching
69:09 - alright so I'm gonna end things now will
69:15 - most likely be back tomorrow thank you
69:17 - so much for watching and for all your
69:18 - help
69:19 - and it was really cool so I know Jason
69:23 - who's the creator of WP graph QL plug-in
69:27 - if you end up watching this recording
69:29 - and seeing this then thank you so much
69:32 - again
69:33 - that was super helpful and and everyone
69:35 - else who helped I really appreciate that
69:36 - thanks hardship for the updates with
69:40 - graph QL and our what are we calling
69:45 - this franciscan site react project and
69:50 - also thank you for for your your work
69:55 - that you're about to do here on these
69:57 - regular expressions so really appreciate
70:00 - it and I'll see y'all tomorrow
70:02 - have a great day
