00:00 - hey so I'm pretty cast ready and as I
00:03 - just wrote in my blog post I'm starting
00:04 - my first year pretty series and the
00:06 - whole idea is that I've gotten a lot of
00:09 - emails from programmers who are kind of
00:10 - learning the code and they're trying to
00:13 - break into and get their first jobs or
00:15 - really just try to learn to code and
00:16 - they have a lot of questions or doubts
00:18 - along the way and and I'd love to kind
00:21 - of take the time out of my take some
00:23 - time every week to kind of answer some
00:24 - of these questions that I think are very
00:26 - very common questions I get and I think
00:29 - I can give you my best advice based on
00:31 - the experience that I've had kind of
00:33 - breaking in and out into the world of
00:35 - being a developer right so this week I
00:38 - got a question from a girl and what
00:42 - she's asking was she said I'm really
00:44 - keen on getting some reaction experience
00:46 - but anywhere I applied to they seek an
00:48 - experience react engineer I have learned
00:51 - reacts to my own and recruiters don't
00:52 - seem to appreciate it further at this
00:54 - stage I pick at the big companies I
00:56 - reach one or two rounds behind the final
00:59 - round and then they say they found a
01:00 - more experienced person for this role
01:02 - recently I got a rejection from company
01:05 - X and company Y they both required five
01:07 - to six years of industry experience my
01:09 - application took me to the initial
01:11 - rounds and they seemed interested in
01:13 - gauging my potential only to find that I
01:15 - was not as good as someone they were
01:17 - looking for next week I'm going to
01:19 - another full stack ball at company C but
01:22 - it's clearly out of my league they're
01:24 - seeking at least six years of experience
01:26 - in JavaScript I'm pursuing it honestly
01:28 - for the interview experience and maybe
01:30 - who knows what if it works out somehow I
01:32 - don't know many people who can who can
01:34 - refer me to these jobs either so how do
01:36 - I get my first reactor without
01:38 - experience I totally empathize with this
01:41 - issue ah and I have been interviewed and
01:44 - probably a little bit over over a year
01:45 - for an engineering role but I was just
01:47 - curious and I kind of Rani's and I went
01:50 - to look at the descriptions of some of
01:51 - their job postings and so for example
01:54 - there's one on Facebook where they're
01:56 - looking for Instagram software engineer
01:58 - and graphics I'm scrolling down into the
02:00 - minute into the qualification section
02:03 - and yes it definitely says you know a BS
02:06 - or master's degree in computer science
02:07 - it says five plus years of professional
02:10 - experience
02:10 - interactive computer graphics using C or
02:13 - C++ a bunch of other requirements so
02:17 - definitely they have the years they're
02:19 - listed another roll at Facebook is a
02:23 - software engineer full stack and look at
02:26 - the minimum qualifications it says BS or
02:29 - MSN electrical or computer science two
02:32 - plus years of relevant work experience
02:36 - so yeah again they list they want some
02:39 - kind of work experience here to another
02:42 - one I went to was Netflix what's funny
02:44 - about Netflix is they don't really have
02:45 - anything but senior software engineering
02:47 - roles on their website so the senior
02:50 - software engineering law partner
02:52 - engineering it says ESRB in computer
02:55 - science five plus years of experience in
02:57 - software development um so again another
03:01 - company that shows year of experience um
03:04 - let's see I also went to LinkedIn I'm
03:07 - looking at their software engineer
03:08 - performance mobile or web this is
03:11 - probably the most daunting job
03:14 - application I've ever seen
03:16 - so many requirements makes my head spin
03:19 - okay one you plus year of experience in
03:22 - mobile web one plus years of experience
03:24 - in software design development algorithm
03:26 - related solutions one plus year of
03:29 - experience in programming and object
03:30 - oriented language two plus years of
03:33 - experience in mobile web or browser
03:34 - performance engineering C yes again they
03:36 - list years of experience that they're
03:38 - looking for then I decided to go and
03:41 - look at some earlier stage companies one
03:43 - is a firm and their application doesn't
03:47 - have any years of experience listed
03:49 - which is cool and it looks like you know
03:51 - they're kind of looking for passion and
03:52 - drive someone who's fluent in fun and
03:54 - web technologies comfortable finding
03:56 - their way around back-end API but
03:59 - nowhere does it list years of experience
04:01 - interesting um another startup I went to
04:05 - as a company called data breaks I'm
04:07 - looking at their full and it looks like
04:10 - they too don't have a minimum
04:13 - qualifications or anything it just says
04:15 - someone who can you know develop HTML
04:16 - CSS and JavaScript good communication
04:19 - skills etc so interesting
04:23 - it looks like some of the bigger
04:25 - companies listed years of experience
04:27 - while some didn't but I'd have no surge
04:30 - to figure out like what kind of
04:32 - companies list years of experience and
04:33 - what don't
04:34 - but overall um it's definitely clear
04:36 - that there's a lot of companies that
04:37 - explicitly state the number of years of
04:39 - experience and honestly sometimes you're
04:42 - looking at these requirements and you're
04:43 - like this makes my head spin right like
04:46 - I totally understand your pain some of
04:48 - these applications sometimes can be
04:50 - extremely daunting because they make it
04:52 - look like there's looking for someone
04:53 - who almost has superhuman capabilities
04:56 - um but you've probably been coding for
04:58 - like what a year maybe two years maybe
05:00 - even less and you really need that first
05:02 - job just like prove yourself right um I
05:05 - can't give everyone like blanket advice
05:08 - but I'll tell you how I approached it
05:09 - when I was looking for a lot of
05:10 - something said like X years of
05:12 - experience it didn't mean that I didn't
05:15 - apply right I'll typically look at the
05:16 - requirements and and and kind of that
05:18 - what the job application said and give a
05:20 - sense of what they're seeking I would
05:22 - try to evaluate whether I can honestly
05:24 - fulfill those requirements for example
05:26 - in the first Facebook one where they
05:28 - were looking for five plus years of
05:29 - experience in computer graphics clearly
05:32 - I don't have five plus years of
05:33 - experience in computer graphics I don't
05:34 - even have one year experience in
05:36 - computer graphics in fact I don't think
05:38 - I've ever worked on computer graphics so
05:40 - I wouldn't apply for that but the second
05:42 - Facebook role with just software
05:45 - engineer at just a full-stack software
05:47 - engineer even though it says two plus
05:49 - years of relevant work experience the
05:52 - rest of the bullets I feel like I can
05:53 - fulfill and even if I don't know
05:55 - everything today I'm confident I can
05:57 - learn it on the job if I need it to so
06:00 - uh that's kind of how I would devalue
06:02 - whether I make it make sense for me to
06:04 - apply or not um and if I'm confident I
06:07 - can fulfill those roles and I would
06:09 - apply and also one thing I've noticed
06:11 - pretty frequently when I was applying
06:13 - was that a lot of this senior a lot of
06:16 - the roles at the said like senior they
06:18 - they must have meant someone who could
06:20 - do the work without needing a lot of
06:22 - help
06:22 - maybe not needing a lot of mentorship
06:24 - someone who can like kind of just run
06:26 - with a stand on their own feet and beard
06:28 - and think through these problems
06:29 - themselves and if you think you kind of
06:32 - made that go ahead and apply who knows
06:33 - maybe you'll get the
06:35 - get an interview right and again it's
06:37 - just important to be reasonable if they
06:39 - say five plus years and C++ experience
06:42 - if you've never written a line of C++
06:43 - then don't apply there's no need to
06:46 - waste your time and their time with that
06:48 - application just be honest with yourself
06:50 - when you're applying and another really
06:53 - great way to get in the door is get
06:56 - referrals I found this to be incredibly
06:58 - helpful and in fact there was a lot of
07:01 - times where I would get a referral into
07:02 - a company and even though they didn't
07:03 - have the job listing for me on the on
07:06 - the jobs page they would they would
07:09 - still give me a phone screen at least
07:10 - because because you know referrals go a
07:12 - long way someone is out there watching
07:14 - for you and saying hey I know prithi I
07:16 - think she's awesome I think she's smart
07:19 - I think she's capable so I'm referring
07:20 - you to this company they're putting
07:22 - their their name in front of you and and
07:25 - they're willing to do that for you so
07:26 - the company kind of takes that as
07:28 - positive reinforcement they're like okay
07:30 - so she got a referral so maybe it's
07:32 - worth kind of bringing her in and seeing
07:33 - what she's got right and another thing
07:37 - that I found really helpful personally
07:38 - was kind of showing them that even
07:40 - though you don't have those years of
07:41 - experience what have you done outside of
07:44 - work right this can be things like you
07:47 - know making sure that you get her
07:48 - profile looks good like do you have side
07:51 - projects that you're really proud of
07:52 - maybe make the public so that someone
07:54 - who's a recruiter or manager can go onto
07:56 - your github profile and see what you've
07:58 - been working on another great way is
08:00 - contributing to open source even if it's
08:02 - just documentation whatever it is any
08:05 - kind of small contribution to make to
08:06 - open source goes a long way it shows
08:09 - what you're capable of and shows your
08:11 - involvement in the community and your
08:13 - passion for programming um another
08:15 - really great way that worked for me is I
08:17 - love writing and I started writing
08:19 - pretty early my programming career and I
08:22 - used writing as a way to explain
08:23 - concepts that I was learning and so that
08:26 - really helped me in my job process for
08:27 - sure people would kind of run across my
08:29 - blog and see that hey like even though
08:31 - she doesn't have experience she she
08:33 - knows what she's talking about right and
08:35 - so the idea is that even though you
08:38 - don't have the experience to show them
08:40 - somehow figure out a way that to show
08:42 - people that you're really capable and
08:44 - you have the potential to
08:45 - those requirements and so you apply and
08:48 - if you get a response Congrats that's a
08:51 - huge step right the first thing you
08:53 - difficult point is a good phone screen
08:55 - and from my personal experience I've had
08:57 - a lot of people use this phone screen to
09:00 - kind of ask me to quantify what
09:02 - experience I've had in the past and I'd
09:04 - be honest I'd talk about my side
09:05 - projects
09:06 - in depth again you know like you know if
09:09 - you don't have experience don't talk
09:10 - about what you don't have talk about
09:12 - what you have because because then you
09:16 - can kind of really show them that even
09:18 - though you don't have that work
09:19 - experience you've done a lot of
09:20 - programming on your own right and again
09:23 - things like side-project open source
09:25 - projects blog post these goes a long way
09:27 - to fill in the gaps for the experience I
09:30 - think that you don't have and once you
09:32 - get past that phone screen at this point
09:35 - the ball is really in your court
09:38 - there are way any doubts that you had
09:40 - along the whole application process
09:42 - about your ability to perform when you
09:44 - apply just throw it all out because
09:45 - you're really in the driver's seat at
09:48 - this point the company what if they've
09:50 - given you their first interview they've
09:52 - indicated that they think you have
09:53 - potential to fulfill the role look they
09:55 - get hundreds maybe thousands of
09:57 - applications and they chose you and
09:58 - they're saying okay this person I think
10:00 - he or she has potential and now it's
10:03 - really up to you to prove that you you
10:05 - do have potential and that you're
10:06 - capable full from the role and I often
10:08 - found that the best way to kind of
10:11 - prepare for this was you know reaching
10:12 - out to the recruiter and asking her like
10:14 - I met her like really bugging them about
10:17 - the role like what is a tech stack
10:18 - what's your role going to be like what
10:20 - are you can expect it what are you going
10:21 - to be expected to do and build what's
10:23 - the cultural life what are the key
10:25 - skills are going to be testing and
10:26 - looking for what's the interview style
10:29 - like is it like a whiteboarding
10:31 - interview is it like a practical
10:33 - take-home interview is it a mix of both
10:35 - like don't ever be surprised about the
10:37 - interview really anything that the
10:39 - recruiter is willing to share with you
10:40 - and just like use all that information
10:42 - to prepare as much as possible and I can
10:47 - go I probably can go talk about the
10:50 - preparation process in another video but
10:52 - the main point I want to get across is
10:54 - like even though the application might
10:56 - have said X
10:57 - years of experience if you've gotten the
10:59 - interview then then the ball is 100% in
11:01 - your core and you really have to use
11:03 - this opportunity short of everything you
11:05 - got because they've kind of put their
11:07 - truck by giving you an interview they're
11:10 - like okay I think she has potential he
11:12 - has potential um and now it's your job
11:15 - to kind of prove that to them and
11:17 - honestly just be honest with what you
11:19 - can do and what you can't do and if you
11:20 - don't know something the best you can do
11:22 - is tell them that you don't know it but
11:24 - should tell them that you have Oh show
11:26 - them somehow that you have potential and
11:28 - that you're excited to learn are you
11:29 - capable of learning that even though you
11:32 - don't know this that you'll you'll
11:33 - you'll sit there and you'll figure it
11:35 - out because honestly no programmer knows
11:39 - everything right like everything every
11:41 - programmer is learning almost every
11:42 - single day learning something new and
11:44 - and they're really looking not looking
11:47 - for someone who knows everything under
11:48 - the Sun but they're looking for someone
11:49 - who knows a good amount but you know if
11:52 - they're throwing something you don't
11:53 - across a problem or faced with some kind
11:55 - of debugging issue they can figure it
11:57 - out they can learn they can they can
11:59 - grow that's kind of the people that's
12:02 - kind of the people that a lot of these
12:04 - managers are looking for to hire and
12:08 - even if you don't get the job because
12:10 - you know you don't meet some you don't
12:12 - have the experience or because some
12:14 - other senior engineer got the job over
12:15 - you really don't waste this opportunity
12:18 - use it as an opportunity to get candid
12:21 - feedback ask the company hey like I know
12:23 - that you know you hired someone else
12:25 - because they had more experience where
12:27 - could I have improved where the
12:29 - variables I'm missing experience was in
12:31 - my should I learn more about databases
12:34 - was it my computer architecture
12:37 - questions was more my algorithms and
12:40 - data structures like where was I lacking
12:43 - the experience and what can I do better
12:44 - next time because you never want to make
12:47 - the same mistake again
12:48 - right and you always want to focus on
12:49 - improving some of the weaknesses that
12:51 - you have don't focus on what you already
12:53 - know really really well for the
12:55 - interview just focus on for the next
12:56 - interview making sure that you improve
12:58 - on what they told you you could have
13:00 - been proved on and honestly if you got
13:03 - an interview for a job that said five
13:04 - plus years of experience and you have no
13:06 - experience that's pretty awesome let's
13:08 - admit it you were basically competing
13:10 - against senior engineers and experienced
13:12 - engineers so use it as an opportunity to
13:15 - grow and learn and and really just
13:18 - experience the process of interviewing
13:19 - for some more advanced roles and kinda
13:24 - conclude um I totally get that getting
13:27 - your first gig is almost the most
13:29 - hardest one and most frustrating one I
13:32 - went through this process myself and I
13:34 - was honestly pretty shocked but by how
13:37 - difficult the process is and I totally
13:40 - get it and in fact my little sister is
13:42 - going through that process right now and
13:45 - it's been taking her a few months what I
13:47 - often found is everyone kind of wants
13:49 - you to come back next year when you have
13:51 - a little bit more experience and you're
13:52 - like sitting there going well like where
13:54 - the hell am I supposed to experience
13:56 - from if you can't give me the chance to
13:58 - get get this experience and I trust me
14:00 - like I know that feeling but this for
14:03 - your first job particularly keep
14:05 - persisting keep applying keep looking
14:07 - let people know around you that you're
14:09 - looking for a job and just use every
14:12 - interview as a learning opportunity
14:13 - sometimes the whole process takes weeks
14:16 - sometimes it takes months sometimes it
14:18 - might even take a year but once you land
14:21 - a first gig it's you you're kind of the
14:25 - next one gets way way easier so work
14:28 - really hard for your first one and in no
14:31 - time you'll have your first job alright
14:35 - I'm done
