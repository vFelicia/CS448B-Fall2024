00:07 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:09 - with jesse
00:11 - today we're gonna
00:13 - handle some ui stuff in particular
00:17 - the first thing i'd like to
00:20 - go over
00:24 - is this uh search input here
00:27 - so
00:29 - i'd like to add
00:31 - a
00:32 - little icon
00:34 - so that a user could close
00:37 - the search
00:39 - uh let's see
00:41 - we had something like this on another
00:43 - project
00:45 - let me show you what i'm what i'm
00:47 - thinking about
00:54 - yes
00:57 - um so i think it'd be something like
00:59 - this uh you know what i think we have a
01:01 - bug right now but you'll be able to see
01:03 - it
01:03 - maybe
01:04 - no
01:07 - oh well basically
01:10 - what i'd like to happen is you click
01:12 - this it pops out
01:14 - and then
01:15 - there's an icon to close it
01:18 - and you can also click on the search
01:20 - icon and that will initiate a search
01:24 - so that's the idea
01:31 - all right so we don't need
01:33 - that project up right now
01:35 - let's get that out of the way
01:37 - um
01:38 - we do have a getter channel now so if
01:41 - you're interested in that um
01:45 - check out i don't know what link to give
01:49 - i guess
01:50 - let me give you this link i think
01:52 - that'll work i'm gonna paste this in the
01:54 - live chat now
01:57 - oh
02:00 - all right see now the uh the camera's
02:02 - frozen from uh
02:04 - goodness
02:05 - all right let's move that out of the way
02:07 - let me grab this one
02:10 - which is way too big let's see if we can
02:12 - shrink it
02:18 - i must have uh i think i was messing
02:20 - with this at some point
02:22 - and got the
02:24 - dimensions all messed up
02:29 - it's kind of odd that it just started
02:31 - happening
02:36 - it hasn't happened in a really long time
02:38 - wow
02:43 - oh well
02:44 - um
02:46 - so we'll have to make do with this
02:47 - camera angle i'll try to remember to
02:49 - look
02:50 - uh over here
02:52 - if i can
02:54 - um
02:58 - but
03:00 - here let me i'm gonna have to sit in a
03:02 - different spot
03:03 - okay
03:04 - um
03:06 - all right so that camera and that's
03:08 - that's too big
03:10 - let's try to shrink that a bit
03:15 - maybe
03:19 - okay
03:20 - all right that looks
03:22 - better
03:24 - um
03:26 - okay cool so
03:28 - anyway i pasted the link to that getter
03:30 - channel
03:31 - uh in the
03:33 - in the live chat
03:35 - if i remember i'm gonna have to put that
03:37 - in the description i keep forgetting to
03:38 - do that
03:40 - but in case you're watching and you
03:41 - can't see the link you're maybe you're
03:43 - watching later on or uh just listening
03:46 - it's
03:47 - getter.i am
03:49 - slash live coding with jesse
03:54 - oh i'm sorry it's live coding with jesse
03:56 - free code camp so
03:59 - all of that
04:01 - all right and um
04:03 - just want to show you before we get
04:05 - started a project that one of you made
04:08 - so harshit who is
04:11 - a frequent contributor so i don't know
04:14 - what maybe for the last month or so very
04:16 - frequent contributor
04:18 - and uh so
04:20 - he has made a pomodoro timer you all
04:23 - know that i um
04:24 - that i use a pomodoro timer
04:28 - and
04:30 - i use the tomato timer well he's made
04:34 - the same functionality if not more than
04:36 - the tomato timer
04:38 - and he's done it in react with gatsby
04:41 - and then published it with now
04:44 - which uh if you're not familiar with now
04:46 - it's it's from the same people that made
04:49 - next uh
04:51 - js so i think it's i think it's zeit is
04:54 - the company anyway
04:57 - really really useful probably
05:01 - i can't really think of an easier way
05:05 - aside from github pages to deploy
05:08 - something get up pages is somewhat
05:10 - limited but
05:12 - now it's just a super super easy way to
05:15 - do it
05:16 - and
05:17 - anyway
05:18 - so if you haven't
05:20 - used that before i recommend it anyway
05:24 - uh so you can see pomodoro timer can
05:27 - start it stop it take long breaks reset
05:30 - right so it's pretty cool
05:32 - pretty cool so anyway thanks for sharing
05:34 - that hardship and also the uh repo is
05:38 - available
05:39 - um
05:41 - so
05:42 - everybody wants to check that out um
05:45 - pomodoro
05:47 - hyphen gatsby is the name of the
05:50 - repo but looks pretty cool the file that
05:53 - has most of the
05:56 - the most stuff going on is the timer.js
05:59 - so that's that's where all the
06:01 - the logic is i suppose anyway really
06:04 - cool so maybe uh let's use harshet's
06:06 - timer today
06:09 - shrink it down a bit
06:11 - and
06:12 - put it up here in the corner
06:15 - and since we've started here
06:17 - may as well get started we're going to
06:19 - do two pomodoro sessions today and then
06:22 - questions after
06:24 - um
06:26 - yeah we'll
06:28 - actually we'll see
06:30 - i need to be done
06:33 - in about an hour or so
06:36 - so i can go to a meeting
06:39 - and
06:41 - i keep forgetting that i'm on a
06:43 - different uh screen now
06:46 - let me see
06:49 - trying to let me aim this
06:52 - camera better there we go
06:54 - all right that's
06:56 - more centered
06:58 - okay
06:59 - um
07:11 - okay well i am getting a call so
07:14 - sorry about this hold on
07:17 - hello
07:19 - yes
17:30 - all right
17:31 - sorry about that
17:33 - uh
17:34 - now's a great time to
17:37 - give my disclaimer about this i haven't
17:40 - given this in a long time but
17:42 - live coding with jesse is all about
17:44 - showing what my day-to-day life is like
17:46 - as a front-end developer so mistakes
17:49 - included interruptions included
17:52 - so sometimes i will have somebody knock
17:54 - on my door at my office and i have to go
17:56 - talk to him or i'll get a phone call
17:59 - so
18:00 - that happens i really don't like
18:02 - when it's that long of a delay because
18:05 - that's no fun for for you all
18:08 - but
18:09 - is a good indication uh so
18:12 - i'm going to take a minute and just
18:13 - explain why i think
18:16 - this phone call was actually ended up
18:17 - being a good thing
18:19 - so that phone call
18:21 - which took
18:23 - i don't know 10 minutes maybe
18:26 - was all about the login system for the
18:28 - bulletin
18:30 - so
18:31 - one of the reasons why we're redoing the
18:34 - bulletin
18:35 - so we're redoing this and we have a new
18:39 - hopefully better login system and
18:41 - eventually we we may even tie it in with
18:43 - the single sign-on system for the
18:45 - university so it should be even better
18:48 - is because i get calls like that
18:52 - and trying to walk people through
18:54 - how to sign in in this case
18:57 - it was an old version of internet
18:59 - explorer that was the problem
19:02 - but then even when switching to chrome
19:04 - there was still some confusion
19:06 - and that's why it took so long
19:08 - so i think um
19:11 - my my co-worker here who is trying to
19:13 - access the bulletin can access it now
19:16 - but i'm still
19:18 - there there was some trouble so i'm
19:19 - still going to set up a time tomorrow or
19:22 - the next day to go over and check out
19:24 - her computer so you could see how a lot
19:27 - of my time ends up being spent
19:30 - on that that login so i think it
19:32 - definitely merits a
19:35 - a redo of the bulletin and this has been
19:37 - out for a year now
19:39 - uh just about a year
19:41 - and so for the whole year i've been
19:44 - you know getting these
19:46 - these types of calls so there were a lot
19:48 - more when it first came out so i'd say
19:50 - the first six months there were a lot
19:52 - more calls than this last six months but
19:55 - still
19:56 - um
19:57 - you know certainly interrupts the
19:58 - whatever i'm working on
20:00 - and
20:01 - and can take up a lot of a lot of time
20:04 - uh so
20:07 - anyway
20:09 - i guess the
20:11 - [Music]
20:12 - the
20:15 - the moral of the story is
20:18 - if you do things right the first time
20:20 - it'll save you a lot of time in the long
20:21 - run not that i did it wrong i don't
20:24 - think it's just i
20:26 - i guess at the time i didn't realize how
20:28 - many people on campus were using
20:30 - very old versions of browsers
20:34 - so
20:36 - that was
20:37 - most of the calls that i get the
20:38 - solution is simply well
20:42 - don't use internet explorer 8 anymore or
20:44 - something like that or firefox 4
20:47 - so anyway
20:52 - all right so let's um
20:56 - let's get started
21:02 - all right someone had said turn the mic
21:04 - on
21:07 - is you all can hear me now right i did
21:09 - turn the mic on
21:12 - um
21:18 - yeah i thought about leaving the mic on
21:20 - for that call but then i thought well
21:22 - maybe this person wouldn't want their
21:24 - conversation here but
21:26 - uh
21:27 - i actu i could have actually there is
21:29 - not really anything that
21:31 - i said that
21:33 - would have even given away
21:35 - uh
21:36 - any secrets you know
21:38 - okay cool okay so the mic my mic is on
21:41 - now so i just wanted to verify before i
21:43 - did anything important
21:49 - all right i tell you what next time i
21:51 - get a call if it's a call like that
21:54 - i'll turn the mic
21:56 - on
21:57 - and uh then you all can hear
22:00 - uh how i
22:03 - how i deal with um
22:05 - i guess troubleshooting
22:08 - uh issues over the phone
22:10 - all right so let's go in now
22:13 - and uh let's go into our code and figure
22:16 - out
22:17 - where this component is
22:20 - and let's try to get some of that
22:22 - functionality like i was explaining uh
22:24 - earlier
22:25 - so
22:28 - uh here in
22:30 - what is this at bar dot js
22:33 - and app.js.js
22:35 - we have
22:37 - we're bringing in this icon button
22:43 - and that's our search icon
22:46 - okay and then we have a
22:49 - handle search toggle
22:51 - okay and that happens
22:56 - when that happens let's see
23:04 - let's see if this
23:06 - handle search toggle there we go
23:08 - okay so here's where it comes up so
23:11 - if you're not familiar uh with this in
23:14 - react uh if you're not familiar with
23:16 - react at all or maybe you're just
23:17 - starting out with react
23:19 - one of the i think it's a cool thing but
23:21 - it's also can sometimes be a confusing
23:23 - thing is that you can actually pass up
23:26 - actions up to parent components
23:30 - and then have the functions
23:33 - that you'd like
23:34 - to be called on that action actually
23:36 - reside in an entirely different
23:38 - component and that's what we have going
23:40 - on here
23:41 - so we had
23:43 - in an app bar
23:46 - right we have on click
23:48 - handle search toggle but when we try to
23:51 - find handle search toggle
23:53 - right the only other place on the page
23:55 - where we have that is where we're
23:56 - passing in
23:58 - right all of this
24:01 - so
24:03 - and actually
24:06 - that might be is is that a style for
24:08 - search title
24:12 - or these are our profs
24:17 - i think actually these are our props
24:18 - okay
24:21 - so
24:23 - it's just a prop
24:24 - we need to go up to the parent component
24:26 - which in this case is index.js for our
24:29 - layout folder
24:31 - and
24:37 - we have
24:38 - you can see our top bar component
24:41 - so in our for our top bar component
24:46 - we're passing down
24:50 - right this function and
24:52 - let's see where we have
24:55 - handle
24:56 - [Music]
24:59 - handle search toggle so this is what
25:01 - really gets called even though it
25:03 - doesn't actually live in that um
25:06 - component
25:07 - um okay harsh destructuring that's the
25:10 - word for it
25:11 - uh i always forget that that's the word
25:13 - for it so when you break down the props
25:16 - like we just saw
25:17 - um so you don't basically you don't have
25:19 - to pre type in this props and then the
25:22 - prop name every single time it's really
25:24 - useful if you have a lot of props uh you
25:26 - can just
25:28 - destructure
25:30 - and
25:31 - have all the props get passed into the
25:33 - component you don't have to worry about
25:36 - using this props so
25:38 - uh
25:40 - very useful but here's basically what
25:43 - what happens and this is really what we
25:45 - want to um what we want to work on
25:49 - so
25:52 - we change the
25:55 - styles for
25:58 - our search icon and our search styles
26:04 - let's see so
26:06 - let's check out our
26:08 - state here's our search styles search
26:12 - icon styles
26:14 - so
26:16 - in this case
26:17 - this says
26:26 - so we start out with
26:29 - display non-display block okay
26:32 - and
26:36 - let's let's go back let's let's see it
26:39 - in action all right so
26:42 - we're going to inspect now i have
26:44 - um
26:46 - the react dev tools
26:53 - there we go
26:55 - okay
26:56 - so
26:57 - with our dev tools let's go to this
26:59 - component which was okay this was our
27:01 - index component
27:03 - so we should be able to go
27:06 - can we go top bar
27:10 - oh no we want to go up
27:19 - state
27:22 - there we go
27:23 - okay so here's is our state right now so
27:26 - hopefully you can see that over here in
27:27 - the corner let me make sure i'm not
27:28 - covering it up okay i'm not all right so
27:31 - just check this out so in real time we
27:34 - can see what our state is
27:36 - on that
27:37 - that top component all right it's not
27:40 - in terms of the layout folder it's the
27:42 - root component
27:44 - so we can see our search icon styles and
27:47 - then our search styles
27:49 - okay and we can watch them change
27:51 - actually i should
27:53 - uh
27:55 - let's see if i can get him to change by
27:57 - clicking
27:58 - there we go
27:59 - okay
28:00 - so
28:05 - let's
28:06 - inspect
28:08 - again and go to
28:11 - correct
28:12 - i have to go down a bit
28:17 - oh yeah
28:20 - am i too far down
28:22 - route
28:24 - stay
28:26 - all right let's go back to the
28:28 - it was home page
28:29 - simpler there
28:31 - okay
28:33 - there we go it's fine apollo
28:38 - home
28:46 - yeah there we go so we're in layout i
28:49 - probably could have found it on the
28:50 - other one i just wasn't patient enough
28:51 - to click through
28:53 - uh if anybody knows of an easier way to
28:55 - open all this stuff and get down to a
28:57 - component let me know
28:59 - is search the the only way that's really
29:02 - easy to
29:03 - do that i know i've i have used a search
29:05 - before
29:06 - but
29:09 - i mean i guess i could find it down here
29:11 - oh well um
29:13 - okay so now let's let's see the change
29:15 - happen
29:17 - so right now search icon styles this
29:19 - display block search styles display none
29:22 - and then when we click this
29:24 - right they flip okay so
29:28 - that's that's how we do that transition
29:30 - in in react right
29:33 - um so
29:37 - let's see
29:39 - let's go back here
29:42 - and
29:48 - let's go to
29:52 - first thing we need to do i guess is put
29:54 - in those elements that we want right no
29:56 - sense in putting in a new state and
29:59 - everything if
30:00 - there's nothing for it to change
30:04 - see gps icon
30:06 - so let me check this
30:09 - where are we at
30:10 - top left okay
30:16 - this is
30:22 - is this what you are talking about
30:26 - this icon select the rack element in the
30:28 - page to inspect it
30:32 - cool and it takes you right to it
30:35 - i like that
30:37 - cool i never knew that awesome
30:39 - thanks for the advice uh harshit and
30:42 - john
30:43 - that's really cool so if you want to
30:45 - just be able to click something and go
30:47 - right to it and
30:49 - react
30:50 - you can click the target
30:53 - and then
30:55 - let's go up to here this one and then
30:58 - click right on that element and it'll
31:00 - take you right to it
31:02 - really cool
31:05 - let's see
31:08 - okay so let's go into our
31:12 - at bar dot js
31:16 - and now we want to
31:20 - we want to add in
31:28 - we need to add in a close
31:31 - icon
31:35 - and we're going to need to change some
31:36 - of the styles for the search icon
31:39 - okay
31:40 - so let me see
31:43 - switch please
31:56 - okay my timer ran out uh thanks for
31:58 - reminding me to check the timer so
32:00 - um so any so harsh it on on your timer i
32:04 - guess you don't have a sound
32:06 - i wasn't prompted to allow
32:09 - allow sounds or anything
32:12 - or allow notifications
32:17 - yeah so i didn't hear any audio it's
32:19 - possible that i just i missed it i
32:21 - wasn't paying attention
32:23 - um
32:24 - but uh
32:26 - okay so let's take a short break right
32:28 - now
32:29 - um
32:30 - in between coding sessions we take a
32:32 - five minute break and i go in the live
32:34 - chat and answer questions and then at
32:35 - the end i answer anything that i wasn't
32:38 - able to get to
32:39 - in our little five minute session so
32:43 - let me scroll through
32:46 - and
32:48 - let's see
32:54 - oh rob was able to make it uh awesome
32:57 - so
32:58 - i'm really glad that you could make it
33:00 - um rob had commented earlier on one of
33:03 - the videos about not not being able to
33:05 - make it for the live uh stream so
33:08 - really awesome that you you did get to
33:10 - make it
33:12 - uh let's see
33:25 - oh okay so on harsh it's
33:28 - i'm assuming with the pomodoro clock
33:29 - you're talking about uh has a bug with
33:32 - github pages that it it redirects um
33:37 - to the main page
33:39 - uh redirects request the main profile
33:41 - which causes conflicts
33:43 - okay
33:44 - yeah there are actually i there is a
33:47 - it's a little weird
33:48 - when you're trying to use some some
33:51 - types of things with like some types of
33:54 - sites with github pages
33:56 - i've had some issues before i
33:59 - i believe i've found some workarounds
34:03 - for that
34:07 - but um
34:08 - yeah it's not 100 straightforward
34:18 - let's see her should ask if anyone has
34:19 - ever has tried firefox developer edition
34:22 - says it's really very cool i actually
34:24 - haven't i haven't tried that so
34:27 - maybe i'll have to try that out
34:35 - okay so uh anthony asks what are the
34:37 - topics on this live stream and uh some
34:40 - of the responses where material ui and
34:42 - react node.js
34:44 - um
34:46 - express
34:48 - yeah yeah definitely i mean that pretty
34:50 - much covers it um but i guess we use
34:53 - create react app to
34:55 - you know scaffold the thing but
34:57 - um other than that i think that does
34:59 - cover everything eventually when we make
35:01 - this live uh it's gonna sit behind um
35:04 - engine x acting as a reverse proxy so
35:08 - we may do
35:09 - a little bit of configuration with nginx
35:11 - but just very minimal
35:26 - let's see
35:28 - uh josh modian says do you use visual
35:30 - studio code i do use visual studio code
35:33 - sometimes
35:35 - did i never actually start this
35:38 - no i didn't
35:43 - uh oh
35:44 - i did something
35:49 - okay now it's working i mean obviously
35:51 - i've already taken up several minutes
35:53 - but
35:54 - um
36:06 - okay cool harsh is saying we just
36:07 - swapped the displays yeah i just i kind
36:09 - of wanted to show um show it like in the
36:13 - react dev tools just
36:15 - number one just in case somebody's never
36:17 - used them
36:18 - uh but then also just to get the idea
36:21 - for people coming from like a um like a
36:24 - jquery mentality
36:26 - more to react that
36:28 - like we're not
36:30 - we're not directly manipulating the
36:32 - stuff on the page like we're changing
36:33 - state and then based on that state react
36:35 - does its thing so
36:37 - um i know when i was first starting with
36:41 - react that was
36:42 - a shift like i i had to get used to that
36:45 - so
36:46 - anyway so i mean hopefully it was it was
36:49 - helpful
37:03 - uh josh rhodey and what program do you
37:05 - use oh um right now i'm using adam as my
37:09 - editor
37:33 - uh joshua says what do you mainly use i
37:36 - mainly use adam so right right now
37:38 - adam's my primary editor and then
37:41 - sometimes visual studio code
37:44 - uh so i i keep thinking about switching
37:47 - to being having visual studio code be my
37:50 - primary one i just haven't made that
37:52 - switch yet
37:53 - um so
37:55 - it's possibility it might happen
38:02 - let's see
38:03 - okay so i've gotten through everything
38:05 - in the live chat right now and i've
38:07 - probably gone over my five minutes at
38:09 - this point i'm not sure because
38:11 - this this isn't the
38:13 - the right time
38:14 - so uh i'm gonna go back now
38:19 - okay so it's about nine minutes after 2
38:21 - p.m
38:22 - my time
38:24 - uh so
38:27 - yeah so let's do one
38:31 - i guess we'll try to get in one more
38:32 - pomodoro session
38:40 - um
38:46 - okay
38:48 - uh
38:50 - let's go back here and
38:53 - okay so we need to bring in a search
38:55 - icon or i'm sorry a close icon
38:59 - uh where are we bringing in our icons
39:01 - okay
39:06 - let's just import another one here
39:10 - and i'm just gonna guess and say close
39:18 - and we'll see if it works if anybody
39:20 - else happens to know what the real name
39:22 - is let me know otherwise we might be
39:24 - able to save a few minutes by just
39:26 - putting that in and uh
39:29 - let's see
39:32 - oh we have one more question so matt
39:34 - matt
39:36 - correct me if i'm pronouncing this wrong
39:38 - is it matija
39:40 - or matija i don't know uh let me know i
39:42 - really want to get it right so jesse
39:44 - will wrap you here in the future what do
39:45 - you personally think
39:47 - um if if by future you mean the next
39:50 - like three years
39:53 - one to three years then yes definitely
39:56 - if we're talking more like
39:58 - five years
40:00 - probably
40:01 - uh but five to ten years
40:04 - who knows right i mean it's that's just
40:06 - in computer time it's just way
40:09 - um
40:10 - way too long
40:13 - so
40:14 - harsh is saying reload the timer page i
40:16 - did
40:17 - i reloaded it and started again oh you
40:19 - know what maybe it's the delay in the
40:21 - video so you might be seeing
40:23 - you might not have seen it yet so
40:25 - uh sorry about that
40:28 - let's see
40:30 - i lost my train of thought oh okay we
40:31 - have that icon so let's throw this icon
40:33 - in
40:35 - and
40:40 - [Music]
40:42 - now we're just gonna see if this this
40:45 - even does anything if it even works
40:50 - so yep it did great so it was named
40:54 - close awesome okay so we now have that
40:57 - close icon and the search icon we don't
40:59 - want the close icon to be visible by
41:01 - default though
41:03 - so what we need to do
41:06 - let's see how we're doing this style
41:08 - switch icon styles
41:12 - and then we have
41:21 - okay it was matia
41:23 - awesome
41:26 - i'm glad i got it right
41:30 - uh all right
41:32 - and that goes for anybody if ever if i
41:34 - ever pronounce any of your names wrong
41:35 - please uh call me out on it let me know
41:43 - all right so
41:45 - sorry for kind of looking around on this
41:47 - harshit actually made this part i
41:49 - believe yeah you did the search right
41:51 - harshi
41:52 - um so harsha did this so
41:55 - i've seen this only once whenever i
41:58 - reviewed the pull request
42:00 - and that was a little while ago
42:04 - should apply input styles
42:07 - see an input okay
42:09 - um
42:14 - yeah
42:15 - where's our input
42:19 - here it is
42:24 - search styles
42:26 - okay
42:28 - so let's go
42:32 - can i throw this style right let's try
42:34 - to throw it right on the icon
42:38 - oh okay so matthias uh it's croatian
42:42 - okay cool
42:46 - i don't think i've had any experience
42:47 - with uh with croatian before
42:50 - so uh
42:51 - that's really it's really cool
42:53 - um
42:55 - style
42:57 - okay so
42:58 - i i know i've said this before but in
43:00 - case you you haven't been around or
43:02 - you know to hear this there are many
43:04 - ways to handle styles in react so this
43:07 - is one of the ways that we're doing it
43:10 - we're passing around styles like they're
43:12 - variables uh we're bringing them into
43:14 - our components so we certainly could
43:16 - style with regular css like we're doing
43:19 - here
43:20 - all right but we're choosing to do it
43:22 - another way
43:23 - and um
43:24 - i don't know that it's settled
43:27 - that there is a number one best way to
43:29 - do styles yet and react it's still
43:32 - kind of wide open so
43:34 - um which is fun it's it's fun we get to
43:37 - try a lot of different things
43:40 - there's a lot of different opinions on
43:42 - on how to do it search icon style nope
43:46 - that's not what i wanted i wanted search
43:48 - styles
43:50 - there we go
43:51 - all right let's save that we'll go back
43:53 - here and
43:55 - check it out we should see yep we see
43:57 - that let's open it
44:00 - okay and we now have i believe
44:02 - conflicting
44:03 - styles so let's
44:06 - let's actually remove this it makes
44:08 - sense to remove this
44:11 - and
44:12 - you know what let's just
44:14 - let's copy all of this
44:18 - all right and
44:22 - put it here
44:25 - and
44:26 - what we want
44:27 - is to change this to
44:30 - search styles
44:32 - and
44:34 - i'm going to leave this on click for now
44:41 - but we we may end up changing that
44:44 - and then we're going to add our close
44:46 - icon here
44:50 - and let me get rid of some of this space
44:52 - because it just annoys me
44:55 - and um
44:58 - there we go oops that's all right okay
45:02 - all right so let's check out uh what it
45:04 - looks like now
45:07 - we should be able to see the close icon
45:10 - yes we can all right the placement of
45:12 - that icon is actually not bad
45:14 - i had envisioned it as
45:17 - being
45:18 - on the line here so i guess within the
45:21 - input
45:23 - but
45:25 - that works
45:26 - and we can certainly take care of that
45:29 - as well
45:30 - with a little bit of positioning
45:34 - um
45:35 - yeah but for now just trying to get the
45:37 - functionality what we want to happen
45:39 - when we click that oh is it already in
45:41 - there
45:42 - yes
45:44 - i wondered if that would happen
45:47 - i i was hopeful i didn't want to say it
45:49 - because i didn't want to sound
45:52 - even more like i don't know what i'm
45:53 - talking about
45:54 - uh but
45:57 - i was hopeful that the way harshit made
46:00 - the
46:01 - handle search toggle
46:04 - that it would just
46:06 - do the opposite right of the styles
46:08 - which is
46:09 - exactly what he did so that was awesome
46:13 - and look at that so this is the
46:14 - functionality that we want
46:16 - the only other thing that i'm thinking
46:18 - about and i'm not sure about but let me
46:19 - run it by you all and let me know what
46:21 - you think
46:22 - um
46:23 - previously on some of my projects i've
46:25 - included a search icon
46:27 - sometimes on this side sometimes on this
46:30 - side i can't remember which which side i
46:33 - usually do but i include a search icon
46:36 - uh my thinking being
46:39 - uh
46:40 - someone may
46:43 - want to click especially on mobile maybe
46:45 - they would prefer to to try to click
46:48 - some sort of icon
46:51 - do you think that's a reasonable
46:54 - um
46:56 - do you think it's a reasonable thing to
46:57 - think or
46:59 - am i just trying to build in things that
47:01 - are unnecessary here
47:03 - um
47:05 - i uh
47:06 - i want to hear what you all think
47:08 - because
47:11 - i wouldn't want to add anything into the
47:13 - ui and add functionality that is not
47:15 - going to improve what we have
47:18 - right then it just complicates things so
47:20 - i
47:21 - i'm
47:22 - kind of really
47:23 - lean towards minimalistic you know is
47:25 - that everything there should have a
47:27 - purpose
47:28 - it for being there and it should be
47:30 - useful to the user
47:32 - so um
47:35 - anyway
47:36 - uh so i'll um i'll just keep checking
47:39 - the live chat to see if anyone has any
47:41 - um any input
47:45 - let's see
47:48 - okay so
47:50 - dessal rollo de serolo
47:54 - uh says
47:56 - i think it's not necessary okay
48:00 - actually let me change before i forget i
48:02 - just forgot to change the title
48:04 - for this uh
48:06 - oops
48:08 - um
48:10 - this is gonna be
48:13 - close
48:20 - search
48:24 - close search
48:25 - yeah
48:28 - let's do
48:30 - let's say close search
48:32 - um
48:33 - i would i would much rather be more
48:35 - specific here i don't i don't want
48:37 - anyone thinking that if they click it it
48:39 - would close everything out
48:41 - uh because you know we we do have a lot
48:43 - of people that uh that view the bulletin
48:45 - that are
48:46 - very unfamiliar with computers so i'd
48:49 - like to be as
48:51 - specific as i can
48:53 - actually now what i think about it
48:57 - i want to change the font size for those
48:58 - tool tips
49:00 - because the people who really need those
49:02 - tooltips
49:04 - probably also need larger font sizes so
49:07 - we'll have to look up in uh material ui
49:11 - if they've already thought of some way
49:12 - like to pass a prop or something if not
49:15 - we can just change it with css
49:17 - but i really i think it could be
49:20 - be a little
49:21 - larger
49:23 - okay let's see
49:26 - definitely
49:29 - oh okay so blake's in favor of the
49:31 - search icon
49:35 - oh okay rook rook mentions uh auto focus
49:39 - on the search bar that's a great idea
49:49 - let's see
49:51 - okay john hanson says mobile logic for
49:53 - ui can be tricky only way to really know
49:56 - if a button or icon to click
50:00 - for a function is by using something
50:02 - like google tag manager actually yeah i
50:04 - mean we could
50:07 - we could put click handlers
50:11 - uh um
50:12 - click tracking
50:16 - on there just to see we put uh on that
50:18 - resource center project that we we did
50:20 - before this
50:21 - i put uh click tracking
50:24 - i think i did it it could have been
50:26 - somebody a pull request if so uh sorry
50:28 - i've i i'm not giving you credit here um
50:31 - but i think i put click tracking through
50:34 - google analytics on everything and it
50:35 - was pretty simple
50:37 - um actually i was just checking the
50:39 - analytics
50:40 - earlier today and we got a lot of good
50:42 - data on clicks and things
50:45 - uh
50:46 - our says will you set up analytics
50:48 - for this yeah we'll definitely set up
50:50 - analytics for this so my the head of my
50:52 - department has to go to
50:54 - sometimes to the president of the the
50:56 - college the president university or just
50:59 - in general like the board
51:01 - and
51:02 - report on how these websites are doing
51:05 - so she really likes to have data like
51:08 - this like how many people clicked to
51:09 - download this and how many people went
51:11 - here right so
51:14 - so i always try to
51:17 - give as much data as i can sometimes i
51:20 - never use the data but it's good if i
51:22 - have it if she comes into my office and
51:24 - says hey i got a meeting in 10 minutes
51:26 - can i have this data then i have it and
51:29 - it makes me look good and it makes her
51:30 - look good so
51:32 - we're definitely going to do
51:34 - analytics right so auto focus search
51:37 - icon autofocus tricky sometimes before
51:39 - you scroll ahead somewhere you don't
51:41 - want
51:43 - add placeholder
51:46 - okay all right so we have a a lot of
51:48 - good ideas let me try to get them all
51:49 - here and just explain it so
51:52 - uh a placeholder when you open this up
51:56 - that definitely makes sense
51:58 - i have a placeholder here i like that
52:01 - we have some conflicting opinions on
52:03 - whether or not we should put a search
52:04 - icon in there so let's save that for
52:07 - last we may not even have time to do it
52:10 - no matter what uh for today's stream but
52:12 - let's save that for last since we're
52:13 - still
52:14 - somewhat undecided on it
52:17 - and then also we're talking about auto
52:19 - focus which there's some discussion
52:21 - about auto focus as well
52:23 - because
52:25 - it can mess up the scroll sometimes
52:28 - i really do like the idea of auto focus
52:31 - because you know you have to click you
52:33 - click search and then you have to click
52:34 - here
52:36 - i i tell you what i'm going to go with
52:39 - auto focus but i'm going to keep in mind
52:41 - when we're testing
52:42 - and try to make sure that it's not
52:44 - messing up the scroll
52:47 - but i
52:48 - i know i would really appreciate in auto
52:51 - focus because if i'm clicking that
52:53 - search icon i want to search
52:55 - so auto focus would be great
52:58 - so let's do that let's
53:00 - so we'll do two things for sure
53:03 - assuming we have time we'll set up auto
53:05 - focus on click
53:08 - and then we will
53:10 - put in some placeholder text there okay
53:14 - let's see and i actually want to
53:17 - i may just check this out on my other
53:19 - screen quickly
53:22 - i just want to look at what the search
53:24 - thing looks like currently on the
53:25 - current bulletin and it looks like
53:29 - okay we actually do let me let me just
53:31 - show you this now i guess
53:33 - so in the current bulletin
53:35 - when you click the search icon
53:38 - so we actually
53:39 - we change the entire
53:41 - uh nav to the search but we do actually
53:44 - have a search icon
53:46 - and a close i wonder
53:50 - you know what
53:51 - i think my search icon isn't even
53:53 - clickable
53:57 - i don't think it's clickable
54:00 - so i think if we just put a placeholder
54:01 - that says search
54:03 - that'll be fine
54:05 - i don't think we need the icon now
54:07 - we do obviously include the close but
54:10 - the search happens
54:12 - when the user stops typing or sometimes
54:14 - even as they're typing depending on how
54:15 - fast they're typing so
54:19 - i just want it to be familiar to the
54:21 - users who are used to that search so the
54:24 - look of it is going to be slightly
54:25 - different because we're not going with
54:27 - this huge
54:28 - search bar that changes the whole nav
54:31 - but i'd like the functionality to be
54:34 - you know identical if possible if not at
54:36 - least as close as possible
54:38 - just to make the transition
54:41 - you know a little bit more smooth
54:44 - all right so let's add
54:47 - where's our text field
54:50 - let's see if we can just say placeholder
54:52 - i don't know
54:59 - i don't know what it is for material ui
55:02 - um which is the the ui framework that
55:04 - we're using
55:06 - but let's try placeholder because that
55:08 - makes sense
55:10 - if it works then we don't have to look
55:11 - it up and save some time
55:21 - yay that works okay so we have the
55:23 - placeholder it goes away
55:25 - when you type perfect and it comes back
55:28 - we don't type excellent all right that
55:30 - was a great idea i think it was hardship
55:32 - that had the idea for the placeholder so
55:34 - awesome
55:37 - um
55:38 - let's see
55:41 - so that was easy it didn't take very
55:43 - much time what was the other
55:45 - autofocus so autofocus may take a bit
55:49 - more time i don't know that i've ever
55:50 - done auto focus and react no i take that
55:52 - back i did
55:54 - i have done it before but it's been
55:57 - i think i did it in
55:58 - march so it's been quite a while so i
56:01 - will have to look that up
56:07 - so let me
56:09 - i'll look this up
56:13 - and
56:19 - all right let's see
56:20 - let me see if anyone has anything to say
56:25 - about the autofocus
56:27 - okay if anyone has implemented autofocus
56:30 - recently in react uh any help would be
56:33 - appreciated otherwise i'm going to try
56:34 - to look it up
56:35 - um
56:36 - let's see also he said uh so we have now
56:40 - let me know if i'm pronouncing your name
56:42 - wrong because it's written in characters
56:43 - i'm not familiar with
56:45 - so i'm arabic i think
56:48 - but is it uh
56:50 - ibrahim
56:52 - so let me know if that's wrong but i
56:54 - think it's ibrahim
56:56 - um but like i said the characters are in
56:59 - arabic so i i could definitely be
57:01 - mistaken but anyway abraham says i love
57:03 - your channel it's very active
57:06 - uh and then have a heart on there so
57:08 - awesome i'm really glad you you love the
57:10 - channel
57:11 - and uh thanks for watching and joining
57:13 - in in the live chat
57:17 - okay so harshit says we could just make
57:19 - a ref and call focus on click
57:26 - oh okay
57:28 - rook that's a that's a good idea so
57:30 - harshit's suggestion will definitely
57:32 - work
57:33 - rook has another idea that could save us
57:35 - a lot of time uh auto focus as a prop so
57:38 - let's try to put autofocus as a prop on
57:40 - the search bar rook saying because it
57:43 - only appears when you click the search
57:44 - icon it should be fine right um
57:47 - yeah
57:49 - yeah you're right it should be fine
57:50 - because it it won't exist in the dom at
57:53 - all until you click so there's no real
57:57 - danger of it accidentally being auto
57:59 - focused and not visible all right let's
58:01 - try that
58:09 - all right
58:11 - it could work it's it's such an easy fix
58:13 - it's worth a try even if it doesn't work
58:16 - okay so it didn't work
58:18 - um but still
58:22 - that was good thinking though
58:29 - uh eunice says how did you learn arabic
58:32 - i didn't google translate learned arabic
58:36 - so
58:38 - i just think it's polite to try to
58:40 - figure out someone's name even if i
58:42 - don't know the characters so
58:44 - um
58:46 - i know for me it would i would feel good
58:49 - if somebody took the time to do that so
58:51 - anyway so i think it's worth it so on my
58:53 - other screen i google translated it so
58:56 - unfortunately i i don't know arabic
58:59 - um
59:01 - oh harsh it you're right you're right um
59:04 - my mistake i missed i mistakenly said
59:07 - that this wouldn't exist
59:09 - but it in fact it does because
59:12 - um
59:13 - the way harsh it made it it's it's only
59:15 - using display none it's not actually
59:18 - um
59:19 - removing a component so my mistake i
59:23 - usually do stuff like that uh where i i
59:27 - make the components actually
59:29 - completely be gone you know be rendered
59:32 - or not rendered based on on the prop so
59:35 - anyway
59:37 - so yeah so
59:39 - that might be an issue
59:42 - but let's try i guess
59:45 - i guess it's worth the shot just to
59:47 - check material ui
59:50 - and see if they have some built-in way
59:52 - of handling something like this
59:55 - it could save us some time
59:57 - um
60:00 - let's try it out
60:02 - text
60:03 - field
60:10 - let's see
60:12 - that's what we're using right
60:15 - text field yes okay
60:20 - auto focus oh okay um
60:26 - cool
60:26 - so autofocus does work
60:29 - we just needed to camel case it
60:32 - so
60:37 - let's see
60:39 - let's try this again
60:46 - auto focus
60:57 - you know what that's not going to work
60:59 - because it auto focuses when the
61:01 - component mounts but then i'm clicking
61:03 - away
61:04 - so that should that will undo the focus
61:07 - so
61:08 - actually let's let's see i wonder if
61:11 - this will work
61:15 - no it didn't i was wondering if when i
61:17 - typed it would actually go in here
61:20 - um
61:20 - even before so let's
61:23 - let's switch this up a bit
61:25 - um
61:27 - no i'm not gonna have time for this
61:29 - shoot
61:30 - okay
61:30 - so
61:32 - in case i don't do this on the stream
61:35 - and i do it before tomorrow stream um
61:38 - actually i'm not going to stream
61:39 - tomorrow i'll give you more info about
61:41 - that in a second
61:43 - i'm not going to have enough time before
61:45 - my meeting to implement this but here's
61:46 - my plan
61:48 - right now
61:50 - when you do handle search toggle when
61:52 - when you click uh a button that fires
61:55 - off handle search toggle it's just
61:57 - changing uh the css from display block
62:00 - to display none
62:02 - you know back and forth
62:04 - what i want to have happen
62:07 - instead
62:10 - is that this text field
62:13 - actually renders
62:17 - on you know on uh on click so what we'll
62:20 - end up having
62:22 - and we'll have to pass down
62:25 - let's see
62:28 - we'll have to change up a little bit
62:29 - about what's going on with our state and
62:31 - then make sure we pass it down like
62:32 - we're doing with these search styles
62:36 - and then we're going to have to adjust
62:37 - our handle search toggle function that
62:40 - resides in our index.js within our
62:43 - layout folder
62:45 - but the end result is going to be that
62:47 - we're going to end up having some sort
62:49 - of uh ternary
62:51 - that is going to check the state
62:53 - which the state and might end up being
62:56 - like show show search um input or
62:59 - something which would just be a boolean
63:01 - and
63:02 - so we'll end up having something like
63:08 - show search
63:10 - um
63:14 - and then if we are showing search
63:17 - we'll put
63:20 - all of that in here
63:22 - right we'll show this
63:24 - otherwise we'll show this so actually i
63:25 - won't do it like this i'll end up doing
63:27 - it like
63:28 - uh
63:29 - question mark
63:31 - okay i am hearing the beeping sound now
63:34 - so my pomodoro session is up and then
63:37 - we'll put
63:38 - this in
63:41 - i actually might have time to do this uh
63:44 - so this is what'll end up happening
63:46 - and
63:48 - so right now
63:51 - it's going to break because i don't
63:53 - actually have so
63:55 - show search being passed down as a prop
63:58 - but what we'll end up doing is
64:01 - in index
64:03 - we'll add
64:11 - show search by default it's going to be
64:16 - false
64:19 - okay so
64:21 - and then
64:22 - where we have our
64:24 - top bar we're going to pass on
64:29 - so show search
64:32 - equals
64:34 - this dot state dot
64:37 - show search
64:39 - and then now
64:44 - what's this video
64:50 - uh tool to title a closed search
64:55 - uh we gotta wrap it
64:57 - um
64:59 - yes we can't have this so let's just
65:00 - wrap this in a div
65:07 - oops
65:11 - and this should be good yeah
65:14 - sure it's just not defined and i didn't
65:16 - bring it in here so let's let's
65:18 - destructure a little bit here
65:22 - show search
65:24 - all right now it should work
65:32 - okay
65:34 - so we had something happen which i'm
65:36 - going to take as a win right now since i
65:38 - just
65:39 - tried to do that as fast as i possibly
65:41 - could
65:42 - um
65:46 - yeah which should happen so this is
65:49 - search
65:58 - yeah i don't know what went wrong but i
65:59 - don't have time to check it out right
66:00 - now but you can see basically the the
66:02 - concept that i'm trying to go for
66:05 - um and the reason being i think we could
66:08 - get this auto focus to work
66:11 - if
66:12 - um
66:15 - if we can have this actually
66:18 - this component render
66:20 - when you click the search icon
66:23 - because i believe this auto focus fires
66:26 - when the component mounts
66:28 - so we want to delay the mounting until
66:30 - the user actually clicks on that icon
66:34 - so anyway
66:35 - that's the idea
66:37 - obviously something's weird about it
66:39 - right now since it's not showing at all
66:42 - but we'll get that fixed it could be
66:44 - something as simple as wrapping it in a
66:46 - div somehow change the styles
66:49 - not sure
66:50 - okay
66:51 - uh let me try
66:54 - quickly to go through the live chat
66:56 - and answer all your
66:58 - questions and let's see
67:04 - i'm
67:05 - trying to find where i left off
67:23 - okay so hardship has pasted a link to a
67:27 - gist
67:28 - that's has a debate
67:30 - about
67:34 - css uh and react and and how to use it
67:38 - so
67:39 - anyway it looks really really helpful
67:41 - let's check
67:42 - and bring it over here
67:44 - so
67:48 - i'll i'll paste the link
67:50 - in the chat as well so it's clickable
67:52 - for you all
67:54 - it's way too long of a link for me to
67:56 - actually read out to anybody that that
67:58 - can't see the live chat so sorry for
68:00 - that
68:01 - um
68:03 - if someone wants to put in a comment to
68:05 - the video that would be awesome
68:07 - um
68:08 - i'll make sure it gets approved a lot of
68:10 - times uh if you try to paste a link in a
68:12 - comment to a video it gets
68:14 - flagged as spam but i'll go in and
68:16 - approve it
68:18 - okay so look at all the different
68:23 - ways to do this so
68:25 - really cool
68:26 - thanks for sharing that harshit
68:32 - uh
68:34 - abstract cats says this seems like a
68:37 - cool learn session as well
68:40 - for those of us just learning i started
68:41 - learning web design about 10 years ago
68:43 - and got distracted but now going full
68:45 - steam ahead awesome
68:47 - awesome that's that that kind of sounds
68:50 - like like me as well um
68:53 - i learned uh
68:54 - some some web development in um in high
68:58 - school
68:59 - and then didn't really do that much with
69:01 - it
69:02 - until
69:03 - too much later on
69:05 - so i'm trying to think
69:07 - actually 10 years might be it might be
69:09 - about the same 10 years so
69:12 - uh yeah well hopefully you learn stuff i
69:14 - do my best to try to explain things that
69:16 - i think might be confusing to people who
69:18 - are just starting out or not familiar
69:20 - with react so you know i don't always
69:22 - i'm sure i i just skip over some things
69:24 - and don't realize that it's i should
69:26 - probably explain but when i when i
69:28 - remember i really uh try to explain as
69:31 - well as i can
69:34 - please
69:56 - all right let's see
70:04 - i'm scrolling through the chat here
70:06 - there's not a whole lot of questions
70:07 - there's a lot of um a lot of stuff i
70:10 - already kind of went over when we were
70:11 - um
70:12 - kind of going back and forth trying to
70:14 - find solutions to this auto focus thing
70:28 - josh modian says for the closed search
70:30 - you could try to make it so that when
70:31 - the user clicks off it closes
70:34 - um
70:37 - yeah yeah definitely i think that's um
70:40 - i actually have thought about that
70:45 - i'm gonna think when i was thinking
70:47 - about it earlier and uh i there was some
70:50 - reason why i thought maybe i shouldn't
70:51 - do it and i can't remember now
70:56 - i can't believe i can't remember i've
70:57 - just tried to think about it but that's
70:59 - that's actually not a bad idea
71:03 - um
71:06 - let's see
71:14 - oh harsha said it it should have played
71:15 - the audio it did it did play the audio
71:17 - this time so that that pomodoro timer i
71:20 - i heard it
71:22 - um
71:26 - oh okay john b says try auto focus true
71:31 - i could try that yeah i mean i
71:33 - i assumed that i could just put it in
71:35 - there and it would automatically be true
71:38 - um
71:39 - usually you can do that
71:41 - uh
71:42 - okay yeah so
71:45 - maybe uh um
71:48 - i'll try that out
71:50 - probably sometime tomorrow
71:52 - um
71:54 - let's see immediately
72:00 - i click a post
72:02 - all right harsha says commit this
72:06 - pr immediately so have you did you
72:08 - submit a pull request now
72:16 - no
72:19 - let's see what time it is okay
72:22 - um
72:23 - philip says i haven't started i started
72:26 - learning javascript but went probably
72:28 - too fast since i missed a lot of the
72:30 - vanilla javascript
72:32 - um
72:35 - but i work full-time with react now
72:37 - should i fill my missing basic
72:40 - javascript knowledge
72:41 - um
72:44 - yeah i i think it's it's always good to
72:47 - have a good knowledge of of javascript
72:50 - um
72:52 - so if you
72:54 - if you can get your work done and it's
72:56 - good work then i wouldn't make it you
72:59 - know a huge priority to fill that in
73:01 - but it might not be a bad idea to just
73:04 - go through some of the basics a little
73:06 - bit every day
73:07 - even if it's only a few minutes
73:11 - i think that
73:12 - you know that would be good because you
73:14 - never know react is is certainly
73:16 - relevant now and i think it will be for
73:19 - at least a few more years but you never
73:22 - know what will happen in the future and
73:23 - the more
73:24 - javascript plain vanilla javascript you
73:26 - know
73:27 - uh the better you'll be able to adapt to
73:30 - any javascript based system that that
73:33 - comes up
73:34 - uh so
73:36 - yeah so probably don't need to learn it
73:38 - right now you know not this month or not
73:40 - even this year but if you do a little
73:42 - bit at a time you i think you'll set
73:43 - yourself up to
73:45 - be able to
73:46 - to adapt uh to changes and make sure
73:49 - that you know you could still do good
73:51 - work
73:52 - uh no matter what happens
73:55 - oh okay how should i get it harsh is
73:57 - saying i should commit this okay cool um
74:03 - yeah let me commit this then and
74:06 - um
74:07 - then i'm gonna have to wrap things up
74:08 - because i have to go to my meeting
74:10 - but
74:26 - um okay that looks good
74:29 - tomorrow i'm not gonna stream so i was
74:32 - looking at my calendar earlier and uh i
74:35 - just have so many meetings tomorrow
74:38 - uh that
74:39 - in and they're spaced out so that i have
74:42 - like an hour between meetings
74:44 - so
74:46 - there's not really a great time
74:48 - for me to uh to do a stream i mean the
74:51 - only possibility would be if somehow i
74:53 - got into work really early and then did
74:55 - a morning stream
74:57 - i don't think that's gonna happen
74:59 - um
75:01 - so on the off chance that i do get in
75:03 - really early maybe i'll do that
75:05 - otherwise most likely not gonna stream
75:07 - but wednesday is looking good for a
75:09 - stream i currently have no meetings
75:11 - scheduled
75:13 - so
75:14 - i think wednesday's like
75:18 - nearly for sure there's going to be a
75:19 - stream
75:20 - unless something weird happens but
75:22 - tomorrow probably no stream
75:26 - uh and if there is one it will probably
75:28 - be in early morning eastern time
75:33 - so
75:34 - anyway i have to go
75:36 - take
75:43 - okay
75:46 - harsha just said get push origin master
75:51 - thanks
75:52 - i i may have forgotten that actually
75:58 - i probably would have just immediately
75:59 - gone right to my meeting and forgotten
76:01 - to push that so
76:03 - um
76:08 - oh cool um all right gideon's back uh so
76:12 - gideon says been away for a while it's
76:14 - not easy meeting up with internet
76:16 - connection and consistencies i missed
76:18 - everyone but it's good to be back home
76:21 - uh awesome
76:23 - hey
76:24 - uh
76:24 - really glad to see you uh in the chat i
76:27 - hope everything's going well for you
76:29 - um
76:30 - okay
76:32 - so now i do have to go i have to go to a
76:34 - meeting in a few minutes but i really
76:36 - enjoyed uh this live stream um it was
76:39 - really cool definitely um a lot of new
76:41 - people in the chat that i haven't gotten
76:43 - to talk to yet so i'm really excited
76:46 - about that
76:47 - and
76:49 - uh yeah so hopefully
76:52 - you learned something and uh i
76:55 - we got some cool stuff done
76:57 - um
76:58 - so
77:00 - yeah so i guess i'll see you
77:02 - most likely on wednesday
77:05 - and uh until then have a great
77:07 - two days
