00:00 - the Swiss army knife is a great analogy
00:01 - because it's it's kind of bad at
00:03 - everything but it's also kind of like
00:06 - kind of good at stuff it's got like a
00:08 - tiny knife and a tiny scissors and a
00:09 - tiny you know tiny you know tiny
00:11 - tweezers it's not a a a a perfect uh at
00:16 - everything thing but it's got a real
00:18 - good General sense and it'll let you
00:20 - survive so I want people to become a
00:22 - Swiss army knife developer
00:27 - [Music]
00:55 - welcome back to the free Coke Camp
00:57 - podcast I'm Quincy Larsson teacher and
01:00 - founder of freecodecamp.org each week
01:02 - we're bringing you Insight from
01:03 - developers Founders and ambitious people
01:05 - getting into Tech this week we're joined
01:08 - by none other than Scott Hanselman
01:12 - Scott's a developer at Microsoft a
01:14 - prolific teacher and he's hosted the
01:16 - handsel Minute Podcast for nearly two
01:19 - decades Scott how's it going man
01:22 - chilling how are you sir I am thrilled
01:25 - to finally sit down and talk with you on
01:27 - the podcast uh I was actually in
01:28 - Portland a while back and it just
01:31 - happened to be a time that you weren't
01:33 - in Portland so we couldn't record in
01:35 - person but now we switched to video
01:37 - podcasts uh and uh just recording
01:40 - remotely so I'm thrilled to finally have
01:42 - you on the show yeah it's my pleasure
01:44 - thanks for uh hanging out what do you
01:45 - got going back there behind you that's a
01:47 - you're on attract mode on your Super
01:49 - Nintendo this uh I do have a Super
01:51 - Nintendo back there but uh Jeff Atwood
01:53 - gave me this uh arcade box it's like
01:56 - basically a main machine type thing and
01:58 - it just has lot of arcade emulators so I
02:01 - like to put different uh games on in the
02:04 - background this is an audio podcast for
02:06 - some and maybe a video for others but
02:08 - I'm holding up a seethrough monster
02:11 - joysticks uh Plex basically an acrylic
02:14 - uh Mame machine I've got a main machine
02:16 - behind me I've got another one that's a
02:19 - Raspberry Pi inside of a mini arcade and
02:23 - then I've got a full miniature Street
02:26 - Fighter here and then I've got this one
02:28 - plus this one so I've got about 14 or 15
02:32 - uh arcades in this room awesome yeah uh
02:35 - I'm a huge fan of arcades I grew up you
02:38 - know in in the early 80s like going to
02:41 - arcades and you know playing Bionic
02:43 - Commando playing Shinobi playing a lot
02:44 - of the the kind of golden age or like
02:47 - right after the Golden Age I guess the
02:48 - golden age is like uh you know like
02:50 - Space Invaders and pong and stuff like
02:52 - that but like once the tech was good
02:54 - enough that they could have really
02:56 - exciting you know sidescrolling games
02:58 - and things like that what kind of games
03:00 - do you play other than of course
03:01 - fighting games it looked like that
03:02 - arcade stick would be really well suited
03:04 - to playing Street Fighter um the the
03:06 - games that that classic games that I
03:08 - like are what you would call a shmup a
03:10 - shoot them up or a bullet hell Japanese
03:13 - bullet hell games where it's basically
03:15 - like you know one of the first ones was
03:17 - 1943 but like the the the ones where
03:20 - there's so many bullets coming at you on
03:22 - the screen that you have to find a
03:23 - single Pixel pass through them and
03:25 - there's like you have a a little guy
03:27 - who's your uh your ship but he has one
03:30 - one heart pixel which is the like as
03:32 - long as you keep that one pixel okay and
03:34 - you're moving it around he's all right
03:36 - and then of course you know Neo Geo
03:38 - anything Neo Geo is great I was on Tik
03:41 - Tok live a couple of days ago uh setting
03:44 - up my uh
03:45 - Dreamcast uh and I just I just literally
03:48 - got uh a couple of days ago a um I'm
03:52 - pulling this over from the other here we
03:54 - go this is a retro Tink 4K this is a 4K
03:58 - upscaler that takes basically any
04:00 - classic input and up upscales it to
04:03 - 4K so I
04:06 - was how does it how does it do that how
04:08 - does it add information
04:11 - like so let me plug it back in it's it's
04:15 - a really interesting thing like we're
04:18 - came we're we're talking about free code
04:20 - Camp here but I can't have an object
04:22 - like that whether it be a joystick with
04:24 - a Raspberry Pi inside or an upscaler
04:26 - without thinking about the science
04:28 - behind it right
04:30 - so when you start digging into like oh
04:32 - it's a box and you plug things in and it
04:34 - makes the screen look better like that's
04:35 - the that's the business right but you've
04:38 - got analog what are called RCA plugs
04:41 - here so this yellow one is where video
04:44 - is inut white is left and red is white
04:48 - and it's basically like six wires the
04:50 - inside and the outside how is that
04:52 - encoded is a is a Super Nintendo sending
04:55 - out 240 scan lines is it doing it
04:58 - interlaced is it doing it Progressive
05:00 - is it doing it 30 times a second or 50
05:02 - times or 60 times a second how do you
05:05 - output that to to
05:07 - HDMI on a modern 4K screen in a way that
05:11 - is consistent and has minimal um uh you
05:16 - know minimal loss but also what is the
05:19 - intent is the intent to sharpen
05:21 - everything and Crispen everything where
05:23 - you can apply algorithms and filters is
05:25 - the intent to make it look the way it
05:27 - looked on a Sony Trinitron
05:30 - CRT with scan lines yeah because one of
05:33 - the philosophies you you have a pixel
05:35 - game behind you that's running which
05:37 - looks like a shmup in fact the um the
05:41 - artist designed the pixel art not to
05:43 - look like the way young people think
05:45 - pixel art looks they designed it because
05:48 - the way that the cathode ray tubes had
05:51 - the scan lines they counted on Bloom and
05:55 - they counted on blurriness so they would
05:58 - design the pixels to look that way but
06:01 - now we're used to like oh I want the
06:03 - crispas Mario that's not the way the
06:05 - designer intended it they wanted him to
06:07 - look kind of smooth and funky and he'll
06:10 - look weird and pixelly if you do a
06:13 - what's called a 2X or a 4X upscaler
06:16 - right but if you upscale it with
06:17 - different algorithms and the the the
06:19 - Retro Tink is a very high-end kind of
06:21 - obnoxious uh piece of equipment um you
06:25 - can make a 4K display look exactly the
06:28 - way you remember a 13in CRT in your
06:31 - parents basement look and they do all of
06:34 - that with multiple layers of filters and
06:36 - algorithms that you would only have the
06:38 - processing power for in 2024 I know
06:40 - that's a big long speech at the
06:41 - beginning of our no podcast but they do
06:45 - that with a whole heck of a lot of work
06:46 - and they do it in less than 10
06:48 - milliseconds yeah that's amazing uh well
06:51 - I will definitely look into Retro tinks
06:54 - uh and uh yeah what I'm using here is
06:56 - just like a one of those Old Dell
06:58 - monitors that I got off eBay from like
07:00 - you know 1999 2000 2001 or something
07:04 - when when they first went to flat panel
07:06 - it's not quite as authentic obviously is
07:08 - playing on CID yeah so that's the same
07:10 - exact thing that's in here it's the it's
07:12 - the very last Dell uh 4x3 1080p monitor
07:17 - yeah what you can do now is take a 4k
07:19 - monitor which gives you four times the
07:21 - resolution and then apply one of these
07:23 - filters and then even warp it and give a
07:27 - uh a scan line give a raster View and it
07:29 - is indistinguishable from a CRT and
07:32 - there's a really interesting video from
07:34 - lonus talks Tech where he has a proper
07:37 - giant 27in you know Sony with a curved
07:40 - screen and he Compares it next to a flat
07:42 - panel and he now prefers the CRT so we
07:45 - have the the tech and we have the the
07:48 - number of pixels to simulate that look
07:50 - and feel and then arguably make it look
07:52 - the way that the uh the artist wanted it
07:55 - so there's really cool math there and
07:56 - there's really cool Tech and that's a
07:59 - one oneperson shop retro Tink uh it's
08:02 - just a gentleman who's passionate about
08:04 - about those UPS scalers yeah I mean it's
08:06 - hard to find like more hardcore devs in
08:08 - any industry than you find in game
08:10 - development because people get so
08:12 - passionate about games and like you hear
08:15 - about like the the story of the creation
08:17 - of Spelunky for example which was all
08:19 - developed by like a single developer who
08:21 - did like the music the Sprite work I
08:23 - think he did the music and and you know
08:26 - people get really fanatical about like
08:28 - this passion project and and they bring
08:31 - it into the world and and sometimes
08:32 - there's a community out there to support
08:33 - their work and then they can make it
08:35 - into a sustained Pursuit like like the
08:38 - the two brothers that developed uh for
08:40 - example what is it a Dwarf Fortress for
08:42 - example they've been working on that for
08:43 - like 20 years well you're familiar with
08:46 - the theory of a thousand true
08:49 - fans enlighten me okay so the idea is
08:54 - that people over people in the in the
08:57 - Creator economy people in the world of
08:59 - Instagram where you are algor you know
09:00 - the algorithm is designed to make you
09:02 - feel bad about yourself get uh overly
09:05 - tense thinking that well I'm going to
09:07 - need millions of fans and I'm never
09:08 - going to be able to make this work and
09:10 - how will I survive da the theory of a
09:12 - thousand true fans is that if you can
09:14 - get 100 bucks a year from a thousand
09:18 - people that's $100,000 and you can have
09:20 - a nice you know kind of middle lifestyle
09:24 - yeah that means if you're an indie rock
09:26 - star if you're a web comic person if
09:28 - you're a Dev if you have a patreon you
09:31 - just need a thousand true fans they'll
09:34 - come and see you if you're in their Town
09:36 - they'll buy your merch they'll buy your
09:37 - t-shirts you just need to get a 100
09:39 - bucks from those thousand people and by
09:42 - putting it into a number like a thousand
09:44 - which is just like0 times it becomes an
09:47 - amount of people that you can visualize
09:49 - you know maybe you went to high school
09:51 - with a thousand people maybe you know a
09:52 - thousand people in your life so um it's
09:56 - an it's an accessible and attainable
09:59 - goal
09:59 - as opposed to trying to get a million
10:01 - people on Tik Tok and then to get Tik
10:03 - Tok to give you $9 yeah for a million
10:06 - views yeah well that's a cool um that's
10:09 - a cool way of thinking about it I mean
10:10 - free C Camp kind of operates that way in
10:13 - that we have uh about nearly 9,000
10:15 - people who support us each month uh and
10:18 - they're just giving us $5 $10 but that
10:21 - is able to enable this charity to keep
10:24 - pushing forward and expanding our
10:26 - learning resources and pursuing our
10:27 - mission that's exactly you're right you
10:29 - are living the dream of a thousand true
10:31 - fans because yeah it'd be great if a
10:33 - million people gave a dollar a month or
10:35 - whatever but but people who deeply care
10:38 - are are are
10:40 - involved yeah well I'd love to talk
10:43 - about retrocomputing for and video games
10:46 - I do want to learn more about you Scott
10:49 - because you're somebody who's been
10:51 - teaching people how to code for decades
10:54 - at this point and he's been working as a
10:56 - Dev for decades and who has been running
10:59 - per perhaps the longest running Tech
11:01 - podcast is are there any Tech podcasts
11:03 - that have been running longer than 18
11:04 - years I I don't know maybe uh that's a
11:09 - good question i' I'm on show I just
11:11 - finished recording show uh
11:14 - 947 yeah that's amazing maybe you can
11:18 - talk a little bit about
11:21 - uh what inspired you to create that
11:23 - podcast to begin with did you ever have
11:25 - any notion that you'd still be doing it
11:27 - this much this much time later did it
11:29 - feel like podcasts were just the new
11:31 - thing and you were just jumping on the
11:32 - trend or what was the I started it
11:36 - because my buddy Carl Franklin was
11:38 - giving me a hard time I think his might
11:40 - be on a longer running podcast. net
11:42 - rocks there in the in the thousands
11:44 - although he does a couple of shows a
11:46 - week um for me we were I was teasing him
11:50 - saying that podcasts were garbage
11:51 - because they were a waste of time and
11:53 - they had no information density which I
11:55 - was teasing you about uh earlier and he
11:59 - says says well then you should start a
12:00 - podcast shouldn't you like if you don't
12:01 - like podcasts cuz kind cuz podcasts
12:04 - early on were talk radio and I found
12:06 - like you know um what's that guy Howard
12:09 - Stern and those kind of shows to be
12:11 - somewhat rambly uh and I had a 30 minute
12:14 - commute and I wanted you know I can't
12:16 - sit in the driveway and listen for two
12:18 - or three hours to uh people chat so for
12:22 - me I wanted some density so I made a
12:25 - show that was 30 minutes tight which was
12:27 - the the length of my commute and the and
12:29 - I did a little you know research and
12:30 - that's the average commute in America is
12:32 - 30
12:33 - minutes and then I realized that people
12:36 - don't like it when you call them and say
12:37 - can I pick your brain I don't like that
12:40 - either like I don't want people to think
12:42 - I'm being a jerk or anything but when
12:43 - you call someone and say hey can I pick
12:44 - your brain There's No Agenda it's an
12:48 - assumption that time is free and that
12:49 - everyone has you know there's there's
12:51 - only 52 weeks in a year like if you
12:53 - start thinking about life like that you
12:55 - realize you don't have a lot of weeks
12:57 - left so I can't just give everyone
12:59 - a lunch um so I'm a little bit you know
13:02 - precious about my my lunches and my
13:04 - dinners I'd rather spend it with my kids
13:05 - and my family so rather than saying hey
13:08 - can I pick your brain you say hey can
13:10 - you come on my podcast and then you
13:12 - record it and then you do a YouTube and
13:14 - you do a pamphlet and you do a
13:16 - transcript and you you know and then it
13:18 - it's an opportunity for you to pick
13:20 - their brain with an agenda with some
13:23 - research you keep it at a tight 30
13:25 - minutes it's information dense fast
13:27 - forward 20 years and you you got 500
13:29 - hours of of tight content and someone
13:32 - even made an AI bot where you can talk
13:34 - to the Hanselman it's bot um and and
13:37 - like ask questions of the last 20 years
13:39 - of tech and and and see if there was a
13:41 - show about
13:43 - it that's awesome so yeah it was done as
13:46 - a rejection of modern podcasting okay
13:48 - awesome and you suuck with that format
13:51 - you're still very tight like it's
13:52 - tightly edited like I listened to the
13:54 - episode where I was on uh which was part
13:57 - of uh I I think it was part of netc yep
14:00 - uh and that was a big Honor by the way
14:02 - thank you for inviting me on there no
14:03 - it's my pleasure um and and it sounded
14:05 - like you made me sound like the smartest
14:07 - person in the world like just bringing
14:09 - all my insights out and and really uh
14:12 - yeah and I used to do heavy editing on
14:15 - my podcast too uh but like I'd always
14:17 - feel daunted personally like when I
14:19 - listen to heavily edited podcast because
14:21 - I'm like man I'm like especially because
14:23 - I listen to double speed so everybody
14:25 - sounds like already twice as smart as I
14:27 - am but once they're like Ed even smarter
14:29 - right it's all like oh man like I don't
14:32 - I don't want to give the impression that
14:33 - it is highly edited it is edited it is
14:37 - professionally edited by a professional
14:38 - podcast editor Mandy Moore uh Mandy is
14:41 - available for podcast editing if
14:43 - anyone's listening and wants to hire
14:45 - Mandy find me on Twitter and I'll put
14:46 - you in touch with her she is a
14:48 - professional podcast producer so I put
14:51 - raw audio into a Dropbox and a produced
14:54 - show pops out the other side um and
14:56 - she's editing you know for clarity for
14:59 - ums but I also have been doing this for
15:02 - a minute so I I I feel pretty confident
15:04 - in the ability to get good content out
15:07 - of good people yeah and it's worked out
15:08 - so far and and it's sustainable because
15:10 - it's just every Thursday for the last 20
15:12 - years yeah yeah getting into a rhythm uh
15:16 - similarly like my email newsletter which
15:18 - been has been going seven years uh every
15:20 - single Thursday get an email out so life
15:23 - is a marathon if you if if someone said
15:25 - oh you should start a podcast yeah just
15:27 - do it three times a week that's that's
15:29 - not sustainable that's why people fail
15:31 - to work out because they go from zero
15:32 - days a week to five and then they stop
15:36 - that's not a thing everyone can do so
15:38 - twice a week three times a week would
15:39 - not be a podcast that I could
15:42 - do yeah well before we dive into talking
15:45 - about like learning the code and talking
15:46 - about uh the net ecosystem which we're
15:48 - going to talk a lot about I'd like to
15:50 - just talk with you a little bit about
15:52 - Portland the city that you live in uh
15:54 - where you've been for quite a while and
15:57 - uh why Portland I was born in
16:00 - Portland and you you know Seattle's just
16:03 - like right up there and there are like
16:04 - lots ofch compan still not better and
16:06 - still not better is
16:08 - it no uh my my you know my family came
16:12 - here and uh they landed in like 1906 and
16:16 - spun on their heel and said we're in
16:18 - Portland now uh I've been here my
16:21 - grandparents are here my uh my dad is
16:23 - here my Mom and Dad are here whole
16:25 - family's here Portland has a great
16:26 - airport has great public transport ation
16:29 - has great uh electric
16:31 - train uh you can you can drive an hour
16:33 - and get to the mountains you can drive
16:34 - an hour and get to the beach there's a
16:36 - half dozen universities here I have no
16:39 - interest in being anywhere
16:41 - else awesome well that is quite a no
16:45 - that's a nice clean answer right it's
16:46 - like I I've filled three passports I've
16:48 - got all the stamps I've been to I don't
16:51 - know 38 countries but um Portland is a
16:54 - very M has a very mild uh very mild
16:58 - climate
16:59 - and uh you've got Intel you've got Nike
17:01 - World Headquarters here I've worked for
17:04 - Microsoft for 15 years remotely from my
17:07 - my home in Oregon so yeah Portland's
17:10 - pretty cool place so at no point did
17:11 - they say hey we we need you to like
17:14 - relocate you were just that's pretty
17:16 - cool you is that common at Microsoft for
17:20 - people to just even way back then 15
17:23 - years ago no it was not common 15 years
17:25 - ago it is totally common now my entire
17:27 - team is remote
17:29 - some of them I don't even know where
17:30 - they
17:32 - live yeah and like how do you work I
17:35 - guess uh free C Camp is fully remote so
17:38 - I don't want to sound like I'm a Critic
17:39 - of uh remote work or anything but like
17:41 - for people who are used to working in
17:43 - offices or managers who are listening to
17:45 - this who are a little bit worried about
17:47 - remote work maybe you could take a
17:49 - moment to talk about the benefits like
17:51 - the trade-offs that you all face as a
17:53 - remote
17:54 - team well I think that being remote
17:57 - requires a level of uh emotional
17:59 - maturity that no one gives you uh
18:01 - preparation for you know you can be one
18:04 - can get lonely working remotely so you
18:07 - have to figure out where your energy
18:09 - from comes from there needs to be a
18:10 - certain amount of conscious focused
18:13 - internal conversation with oneself about
18:15 - what feeds their Spirit if if you know
18:19 - sitting on your kitchen counter with a
18:21 - laptop is not going to you know feed
18:24 - your spirit then that's going to be a
18:25 - problem and you're very quickly going to
18:27 - regret it but at the same time if a
18:29 - 90-minute commute into the next city is
18:31 - going to be Soul crushingly sad that's
18:34 - also a problem yeah so I will go sit at
18:37 - McDonald's and I will go sit at you know
18:40 - at Chipotle and I will use their Wi-Fi
18:42 - and I will hang out and get energy I'll
18:45 - sometimes I'll go and sit at the mall in
18:47 - the food court uh couple of times a year
18:50 - I will drive up to Seattle and hang out
18:53 - with folks uh there's a local Portland
18:55 - office which is like a little sales
18:57 - office and I'll go and you know I don't
18:59 - drink coffee but they have a kitchen so
19:01 - I can just be somewhere where there are
19:02 - humans but that can also be sitting in a
19:05 - park but my job as a as a a program
19:08 - manager at Microsoft and they have a
19:11 - they have a these three things that SAA
19:13 - says your job is to uh create Clarity
19:17 - generate energy and deliver results now
19:20 - that sounds squishy but the idea is how
19:23 - do you get people to do a thing right
19:26 - you're you're a program manager you have
19:27 - a program you have a thing an initiative
19:30 - a program is just an initiative and you
19:31 - want to manage meaning move forward and
19:34 - her all of the Cats into all these cats
19:37 - that are running around the field you
19:38 - okay okay we're going in that direction
19:41 - well I don't understand what's going on
19:43 - all right let's create some clarity
19:44 - here's the goal all right this is good
19:46 - now convince me it's a good idea
19:47 - generate energy a recent example would
19:50 - be uh Katie on my team working with you
19:53 - to get C A C C
19:56 - certification on free code Camp so you
19:58 - can go to free Cod camp or you can go to
20:00 - Microsoft and you can get a
20:02 - certification on on behalf of us on
20:04 - behalf of Microsoft and free Cod Camp
20:06 - everybody wins but how did Katie as a
20:09 - new graduate at
20:12 - Microsoft from her
20:14 - apartment do
20:17 - that she's got to get people excited
20:19 - she's got to write documents and explain
20:21 - it she's got to get on phone calls she's
20:22 - got to get on emails generate energy get
20:25 - clarity going and then everyone goes oh
20:27 - man that's a great idea and she freaking
20:29 - did it yeah yeah and and you did too
20:32 - remotely yeah we corresponded we had
20:34 - maybe like five or 10 meetings over the
20:36 - course of development of that
20:37 - certification everything got done and so
20:40 - yeah I really like this funny how that
20:41 - works and you didn't have to fly
20:43 - anywhere no uh I still haven't met her
20:45 - in person hopefully I'll meet her in
20:46 - person hopefully I'll uh meet you in
20:48 - person again we did meet at codie way
20:51 - back uh the the very first codeland
20:54 - conference
20:55 - uh yeah so I'm curious about like what
20:59 - got you into software development uh
21:03 - because you worked your way up through
21:06 - the entire software development
21:07 - ecosystem you were like an architect for
21:10 - a while and now you're managing other
21:11 - developers in addition to doing
21:13 - development yourself uh like what got
21:17 - you into programming and do you remember
21:21 - around what age you started getting
21:23 - excited about
21:25 - programming I've told this story before
21:27 - when I
21:29 - was 11 or 12 they brought a Apple 2 to
21:34 - the to the school and it this was a time
21:37 - when an apple 2 was probably $3,500 mhm
21:41 - um this is big
21:42 - money and there wasn't an apple two like
21:45 - for each classroom there was one for the
21:47 - building so there wasn't we weren't a
21:50 - school that had a lab this was not a
21:51 - school with money uh so there was this
21:54 - one computer and I I had a knack for
21:57 - that computer I don't know why it just
21:58 - it made sense and I opened it up and I
22:01 - looked inside and I started to figure
22:03 - out what was going on and Mrs Hill
22:05 - maryan Mayfield Hill rip was a uh my
22:09 - fifth grade teacher and she allowed me
22:13 - and my dad with a deal from the
22:15 - principal to basically steal the LA the
22:18 - the machine and take it home on Friday
22:21 - night uh he would back my dad would back
22:24 - his pickup truck up against the building
22:26 - and we would borrow this machine as long
22:28 - as it was back by Sunday night and that
22:30 - that was an opportunity to use this
22:33 - machine and take it home in a in a in a
22:35 - time when that machine was worth 10x
22:38 - what the car was worth um but I spent my
22:41 - weekends on that machine and then we my
22:44 - dad had another car which was a a blue
22:47 - 1972 Ford econol line van MH and I was
22:51 - sitting out in the front of our house
22:52 - and one day I came home and the van was
22:54 - gone and I went inside and I said hey
22:57 - man where's the van and and he said we
22:59 - bought a computer at Sears we got you a
23:01 - Commodore 64 it's apparently the big
23:03 - computer that everyone's talking about
23:04 - these days and I still have it in the
23:06 - garage I can go and get the box and show
23:07 - it to you it's got Sears tape Sears used
23:10 - to when you buy something at Sears they
23:11 - would have this tape that they would
23:13 - wrap around it like like um like a
23:17 - yellow police tape and it said Sears
23:19 - yeah and it would it would prove to you
23:20 - that you bought it at Sears and then
23:22 - when you go out the door they know that
23:23 - you you know you didn't steal the thing
23:25 - cuz it's got the taper around it so I've
23:27 - got that that computer in the other room
23:29 - and I've actually got a comer 64 right
23:31 - here all right and I'll just uh narrate
23:34 - uh Scott has gotten up out of his seat
23:37 - and whoa it's it's built it's the model
23:39 - that's built right into the keyboard
23:41 - This is called the bread box or the
23:43 - bread bin rather pardon me then I've got
23:46 - a fastload cartridge to make it go
23:47 - faster that had 64k of ram I've got a
23:51 - couple of com 64s including an
23:54 - fpga uh reimplementation of a comer 64
23:58 - which is a modern commer 64 they're
24:00 - making modern 64s in in 2024 yeah and uh
24:04 - and then I've Al this is called a
24:06 - 6502 uh microprocessor and I've I'm I'm
24:09 - building an apple 1 with a 6502 as a as
24:13 - a hobby project over here on the
24:15 - floor awesome so yeah that's where that
24:18 - started and uh and then I went and
24:21 - visited a bunch of schools uh thinking
24:24 - that I would maybe go to I don't know
24:26 - MIT or something fancy but I was not
24:29 - emotionally ready for that nor was I
24:31 - mature enough so I visited some schools
24:35 - uh and I didn't think I could pull it
24:37 - off so I instead moved into my parents
24:40 - garage and then I went to a a buddy of
24:43 - mine and I was like man I don't have
24:45 - anywhere to go to school I'm screwed uh
24:47 - somewhere in like April of my senior
24:49 - year cuz I had no plan and I uh my buddy
24:54 - his name was Jack Elmore started
24:56 - teaching me C and he taught me point in
24:59 - C and he said hey you know Portland
25:01 - Community College is doing a class it's
25:04 - the very first software engineering
25:07 - cohort at Portland Community College do
25:09 - you want to you and me will go there and
25:11 - we'll become the first the first
25:13 - graduates of software engineering at not
25:16 - computer science we should separate
25:18 - those two things and I ended up spending
25:20 - about 11 years going to school and I
25:23 - finished my four-year degree 11 years
25:25 - later working at night 11 years
25:29 - that's a that's a substantial duration
25:32 - of say at Portland well one of the funny
25:34 - things in the US that maybe people don't
25:36 - realize is that when you are doing um a
25:39 - degree uh there's a certain amount of
25:41 - time that you have to get that degree
25:43 - usually it's about six to seven years so
25:45 - after seven years your credit kind of
25:48 - rots or expires so seven years in I get
25:52 - this notification from the dean that I
25:53 - need to take writing 121 again and and
25:57 - uh I'm like well this is English it's
25:59 - like writing 121 And I said can I can I
26:01 - give you some some writing samples can I
26:04 - how can I get out of this and at this
26:06 - point we you know I'm 10 years into my
26:08 - career or seven or eight years into my
26:10 - career and I'd already written books so
26:12 - I was like hey I could give you one of
26:14 - the books that I've written and that got
26:16 - me out of writing 121 I gave him like
26:18 - this rocks book I think it was like um I
26:21 - think it was access 2000 programming
26:24 - that I'd written like one of the Red
26:26 - Rocks books and then then other things
26:29 - started to you know like I'm I'm taking
26:30 - longer and longer and longer to do my
26:31 - degree so then um at this point I think
26:34 - it's 200000 I'm like eight or nine years
26:36 - out of school not out of school out of
26:39 - high school but I'm still trying to get
26:40 - my degree done so then I said well
26:43 - this's this new language called C that's
26:45 - that's that's Outnet how about I teach a
26:48 - class so I made a deal with the dean of
26:51 - the Oregon Institute of Technology to
26:53 - let me teach this class and I was the
26:55 - first non-degreed adjunct professor
26:58 - and if I kept teaching the class they
27:00 - would let me have my my credit not
27:03 - rought and then I ended up graduating uh
27:05 - 11 years later and then they gave me
27:08 - like a young professional Achievement
27:09 - Award because I was teaching adjunct uh
27:12 - at these these universities it was kind
27:13 - of cool that's really cool first of all
27:16 - it's wild to me that uh that like their
27:19 - weird kind of backward I mean what a
27:22 - punative policy for all the busy parents
27:24 - and other people out there that just
27:26 - don't have time to finish school
27:28 - I think most people don't even finish
27:30 - school within six years anymore uh so
27:32 - the fact that they if they still have
27:34 - that policy they need to get rid of it
27:36 - because well I mean I get it but I don't
27:38 - like it's like some things end like for
27:40 - example I'm looking at my degree every
27:42 - language that I learned other than c is
27:44 - gone every operating system is gone but
27:47 - so I get the idea like this information
27:48 - isn't modern but like writing yeah
27:51 - writing 121 like calculus I don't think
27:53 - that should rot you should be able to
27:55 - carry that around forever so yeah I 90%
27:57 - agree with you
27:58 - okay well uh so you were able to
28:01 - eventually finish your degree but by
28:03 - that point you had already started
28:04 - working in the field obviously you you
28:06 - were a published author in the technical
28:09 - book space maybe you can just briefly
28:11 - take us through some of your early roles
28:14 - and uh how you were able to get some of
28:16 - these obviously you hadn't finished your
28:18 - degree yet so you were able to get them
28:19 - without the degree in software
28:22 - engineering yeah that that's a tough one
28:26 - people when we hire at Microsoft when I
28:29 - hire people I honestly don't look at
28:31 - their their degrees the the phrase that
28:35 - we have is an is an analogy you can tell
28:38 - me if you like this or not but when
28:39 - you're putting together a basketball
28:40 - team you usually want to focus on height
28:43 - so I want to hire tall people I can
28:46 - teach them ball handling I can teach
28:47 - them how to dribble but if they're tall
28:49 - they're probably going to be successful
28:51 - in basketball that's a that's a general
28:52 - rule now there are some successful small
28:54 - small people in basketball but as a
28:56 - general rule higher for height so then
28:58 - the question is what does height mean
29:00 - again I'm saying that in air quotes with
29:02 - my fingers here when it means software
29:04 - it means that if the person has this if
29:07 - you get this sense that this person can
29:09 - do it then they're tall does that make
29:12 - sense yeah so like I don't like if you
29:14 - don't know C you know JavaScript but you
29:16 - get you get it you get computers this
29:19 - person's tall will teach
29:22 - them the whatever the other language is
29:24 - so if if you get JavaScript I can teach
29:26 - you Ruby if you get Ruby I can teach you
29:28 - C so the question is Quincy how do
29:32 - you how do you express to an interviewer
29:36 - that you are tall how do you express
29:39 - that you get it is it that you are a
29:41 - clear Communicator is it that you
29:44 - understand systems and how things plug
29:47 - together I really like this idea of
29:49 - systems thinking like like if we go back
29:52 - to our retro Tink call back um I
29:55 - probably couldn't code this right the
29:58 - per Mike who made the retrotink is
30:01 - clearly an amazing programmer
30:03 - mathematician but I understand all of
30:06 - the systems that make it happen and I
30:10 - have a general kind of I call it Swiss
30:12 - army knife level understanding which
30:15 - means that like the Swiss army knife is
30:17 - a great analogy because it's it's kind
30:19 - of bad at everything but it's also kind
30:22 - of like kind of good at stuff it's got
30:24 - like a tiny knife and a tiny scissors
30:26 - and a tiny you know tiny you know tiny
30:28 - tweezers it's not a a a a perfect uh at
30:32 - everything thing but it's got a real
30:35 - good General sense and it'll let you
30:36 - survive so I want people to become a
30:38 - Swiss army knife developer but if you
30:41 - have no concept of of like the scissors
30:44 - part you should probably learn a little
30:45 - bit about scissors you know there's like
30:47 - a saw in here there's like there's like
30:50 - pliers nail Army knives like there's a
30:52 - bunch of cool stuff in here you know
30:54 - what I mean this is the Swiss army knife
30:56 - that my father gave me at age 12 this is
30:58 - the original if it's on my desk to
31:01 - remind me of that stuff so while I can't
31:03 - tell you and explain the code behind
31:06 - this upscaler I get all of the concepts
31:09 - from the electrons that are on the wire
31:12 - all the way up until it goes out to HTMI
31:15 - and I have a 70% understanding of the
31:19 - system in which it exists yeah and you
31:21 - do too CU I could tell you were nodding
31:23 - when we were talking about it yeah I
31:26 - yeah I kind of get it in filters and how
31:27 - it works
31:28 - so if someone comes into a job and they
31:30 - have a sense of like well here's how a
31:32 - website is generally architected here
31:34 - are the languages that are involved I
31:36 - learned JavaScript at free code camp but
31:39 - I understand this website uses python or
31:42 - C but the pieces are the same yeah oh I
31:45 - drive a Toyota well that's cool I drive
31:47 - a Honda that's cool we I can teach you
31:50 - how to drive Toyotas does that make
31:52 - sense does that analogy work yeah that
31:54 - works uh so to what would you attribute
31:57 - your
31:58 - systems knowledge and like how did you
31:59 - build that
32:03 - up uh professional
32:06 - curiosity like how can you not be
32:08 - excited and that's a part that I don't
32:10 - know how to teach but I want people to
32:11 - think about that like um you know my my
32:14 - 16-year-old wanted to understand how the
32:17 - uh the the faucet at the at the um
32:20 - airport knew that his hands were
32:21 - underneath it that's a whole interesting
32:24 - conversation about like what is it using
32:26 - is it using IR is it using radar are
32:28 - what's a motion detector like is the
32:30 - thing in the faucet at the airport the
32:32 - same as the motion detector that like
32:35 - detects the door at Target then you
32:38 - start having conversations that there's
32:40 - a person and this is fascinating to me
32:42 - Quincy there's a human being who
32:45 - designed the thing at Target that opens
32:48 - the door is it a plate in the floor like
32:51 - that's an interesting question like when
32:52 - you stand it opens the door is it a
32:55 - motion detector some places it's a
32:58 - motion detector some places it's a
32:59 - button some places it's a plate in the
33:01 - ground and then you can start talking
33:03 - about how do you solve that problem yeah
33:05 - for the people yeah and then you just
33:09 - can't stop thinking about systems yeah
33:13 - and and so do you often Ponder those
33:15 - things like when you you know are just
33:18 - doing something let's say you're uh
33:21 - opening for lack of a better example
33:24 - this just came to mind let's say you're
33:26 - uh you're putting your luggage onto the
33:29 - radiator thing in the airport and it's
33:31 - going through there and it's SC yeah
33:35 - yeah I mean you find yourself often
33:36 - pondering those things oh yeah like
33:38 - every every freaking day how can you not
33:42 - like I was at McDonald's earlier I'm
33:43 - holding up my my $1 McDonald's Diet Coke
33:46 - who wrote the touchcreen with the button
33:49 - like someone designed that someone drew
33:52 - a picture of a soda bit map PNG I don't
33:56 - know someone McDonald's is out there if
33:59 - you go to McDonald's and there's like
34:00 - when you're going through the drive-thru
34:01 - there's a sign on the wall with like a
34:02 - picture of like some food there was a
34:04 - team that took a picture of that food
34:07 - like a photographer and they like it's
34:08 - all fake and it's like not really
34:10 - mayonnaise right but there's a number at
34:12 - the bottom look at the lower right
34:14 - corner or the lower left corner of the
34:15 - McDonald's sign it's like 01-04 06
34:19 - someone in McDonald's made that number
34:21 - there's a marketer who's like okay all
34:23 - the McDonald's have to swap out for the
34:24 - new cardi B burger and that one's got
34:27 - this number and then there's a person in
34:29 - Photoshop who drew that there's a
34:31 - printer who made it um there's like a
34:35 - whole system well at least one of the
34:37 - devs who worked on the McDonald's
34:39 - touchscreen UI went through free code
34:40 - Camp cuz I saw them tweeting about that
34:42 - the other day that's what I'm talking
34:43 - that's fantastic right yeah like this is
34:45 - the remote control for the Retro tin and
34:49 - like you know you like if I hold that up
34:54 - in my um uh with my camera and like try
34:58 - to here's my here's my
35:00 - camera and you can see me on the camera
35:04 - and here's the remote control and like
35:07 - you can kind of see the light in behind
35:09 - it because it's IR yeah like that kind
35:11 - of stuff I just can't not I can't see
35:15 - the IR I can point it at my eyes but if
35:16 - I can point it to the back of the camera
35:19 - I can see it like you know and then I
35:21 - can spend a whole weekend trying to
35:22 - figure that out how do you teach people
35:26 - that I tell them that it exists and then
35:29 - you let them feel like you too can take
35:31 - apart the
35:34 - toaster how did they make I want warm
35:36 - bread let's go learn about how toasters
35:39 - work yeah yeah I used to I spent a great
35:42 - deal of time going down like rabbit
35:43 - holes on like how stuff works.com back
35:46 - in you know the early 2000s and learning
35:49 - about how W pools work at the water park
35:52 - uh you know learning about uh how you
35:55 - know hydroelectric dams work I mean the
35:57 - world is filled with engineering and a
36:00 - lot of that like you can draw from some
36:02 - form of problem and its solution you can
36:05 - kind of draw analogies that you can use
36:07 - and Implement in code too so I don't
36:09 - look at it as time squandered following
36:12 - Flights of Fancy I often do have like
36:15 - analogous solutions to problems and and
36:17 - sometimes it's helpful when I need to
36:18 - communicate like a a potential approach
36:21 - just being interested in the world
36:24 - around me yeah it sounds like you're
36:26 - intensely interested in the world around
36:27 - you I am and I also like I'm overwhelmed
36:32 - by the layers of
36:35 - abstraction right there's layers on top
36:37 - of layers on top of layers uh this um an
36:41 - interesting an interesting thing
36:42 - happened this weekend if you don't mind
36:44 - like a little story okay so there's this
36:47 - guy you can Google with B for named Ray
36:50 - aie Ray Aussie invented Lotus Notes he's
36:54 - a famous computer scientist and he was
36:55 - the CTO of uh of Microsoft for a number
37:00 - of years and uh this this young person
37:03 - on online is really interested in old
37:06 - versions of Dos dis operating system the
37:08 - operating system that came out before uh
37:11 - windows and dos uh came out during a
37:15 - time was another operating system called
37:17 - CPM and then IBM went off and made os2
37:21 - operating system 2 and os2 and windows
37:24 - were like competing operating systems so
37:26 - Ray Aussie has has this computer museum
37:28 - at his house you can find video of his
37:31 - computer Museum online and the young
37:33 - person was talking to Ray azi and found
37:36 - they found a copy of Doss that has never
37:39 - been released and it was like on a disc
37:42 - in Ray's you know Ray's uh office so I
37:46 - talked to Ry and he he sends me the
37:47 - discs because I said I'll I'll take I'll
37:50 - see if I can get the material off of the
37:51 - discs so these are on
37:54 - floppies so I'm holding up a FL floppy
37:56 - 5.5
37:57 - this is a 5.25 in and4 in floppy and
38:02 - this is a three this this floppy has
38:06 - 360k that's one frame of one of our
38:10 - videos like take a screenshot that's
38:12 - bigger than this
38:13 - floppy right and you can see it says DS
38:17 - DD double-sided double density they're
38:20 - single-sided floppy single density
38:22 - floppy so you would have like 180k
38:25 - floppy a 320 a 360
38:28 - we were eeking out extra extra bites on
38:33 - floppies and then you'd get up to a 1.2
38:35 - megabyte floppy which was just immense
38:37 - who could who could have such huge
38:39 - amounts of data quy oh my God right and
38:43 - then uh 1.44 Meg was like the max but
38:46 - this was a
38:47 - 360k floppy so how do you get data off
38:52 - of a 360k floppy in 2024 my friend what
38:56 - do you think Pro I mean probably just go
38:58 - get a really old drive or did they all
39:00 - rot do any of the driv still work so you
39:02 - can get a really old drive but really
39:05 - old drives don't plug into modern
39:07 - machines so then a listener or yourself
39:09 - might say well
39:11 - just just and saying that in any report
39:15 - just you know get a USB floppy well USB
39:19 - 5 and A4 inch floppies do not exist it's
39:22 - not a thing uh there are uh 1.44 or 3
39:27 - and a/4 in 3 and 1/2 inch floppies
39:29 - rather you can buy a USB floppy but
39:32 - there's no way to to do that like modern
39:35 - floppies are um not a thing especially
39:38 - on on real floppies because this is
39:40 - literally B bendy plus um we we just
39:44 - assume everything works because we plug
39:46 - our USB PL you know you take a USB and
39:48 - you plug it in it works Mac speaks dos
39:51 - and dos speak you know like everyone
39:52 - speaks the same thing there are file
39:55 - systems there's EXT fat
39:57 - file allocation table there's fat 32 and
40:01 - there's NTFS new technology file system
40:04 - but for the most part you plug a USB in
40:06 - and it kind of just works right right
40:09 - back in the day there were 50 different
40:12 - kinds of file systems and just a bunch
40:14 - of competing standards every company was
40:17 - kind of like trying to make their own
40:18 - proprietary ecosystem everybody wanted
40:21 - to win and then fat kind of won but
40:24 - that's a file system that that's like a
40:27 - way to do directories and layouts and
40:29 - stuff like that but it doesn't describe
40:31 - the actual how do you get the magnetic
40:33 - signals onto the disc and where do those
40:37 - sectors go and this thing is literally
40:40 - spinning
40:42 - rotating and there's a head that's
40:44 - floating over it all of those decisions
40:46 - that's even lower level like the layout
40:49 - of that system so if uh if I went and
40:53 - found like a I could find a Windows 95
40:55 - or or Windows 3.1 machine like go to
40:58 - like free geek or one of these older
41:00 - machines and try to find one then I
41:02 - could copy it onto the machine but then
41:04 - how would I get it off of that machine
41:06 - because those machines aren't on the
41:07 - internet and they don't have
41:10 - USB could you could you like stair step
41:12 - it up different Generations like maybe
41:15 - move it to 3.5 and then move it from the
41:17 - 3.5 to that's exactly what I was going
41:19 - to do my idea was get it onto like an
41:21 - old Pentium or an old 486 go from three
41:25 - 5 in to 3 and 1/2 and then from 3 and
41:27 - half to USB and then and then go off um
41:31 - I so I went around though and found that
41:33 - there is a machine there's a there's a
41:35 - board a custom board called a grease
41:38 - weasel and this is a person who has made
41:42 - an open source and open Hardware
41:44 - standard grease weasel with a z and this
41:47 - is a
41:48 - USBC
41:50 - to ribbon cable that you can then and I
41:53 - went on eBay and I bought a a drive
41:57 - however ever the part that I think is so
41:58 - fascinating about this is that this
41:59 - doesn't just turn into like the a drive
42:02 - or the B drive it allows you to use a
42:05 - python script at the command line to rip
42:08 - down the magnetic flux signals directly
42:12 - off the dis and put it in a binary file
42:15 - called an
42:16 - IMG a floppy Drive image you know people
42:21 - expect today to plug it in and it's
42:22 - going to mount and I look I have a drive
42:24 - and I can double click but this is way
42:26 - way earlier these are dude these discs
42:30 - these discs are from May of
42:33 - 1984 yeah that's 40 years ago like so
42:38 - this is really cool to think about if
42:39 - you think about systems and layers how
42:42 - long did it take to get us where I could
42:44 - take a USB and plug it into any computer
42:47 - on any operating system and see a text
42:50 - file we we we had to figure out text
42:54 - file um uh coding is it 8 bit asky is it
42:59 - seven bit asky is there line feeds are
43:01 - there Carriage returns what's a carriage
43:04 - why is it returning this like figuring
43:06 - out line to do with like slapping the
43:08 - typewriter when you get to the end of a
43:10 - line right dude look at this hang on
43:13 - okay okay he's getting back up uh for
43:15 - for those of you listening and that
43:17 - don't have the video he just happily
43:19 - kind of pranced off and now he's back
43:22 - and now I've got a typewriter this is a
43:24 - Lego typewriter Lego so like carriage
43:28 - return and Line Feed on Windows if you
43:30 - have a text file and you type and you
43:32 - press enter you get a carriage return in
43:34 - a line feed on on a on a Linux machine
43:37 - you get a Line Feed and on early Max you
43:39 - get a carriage return what's a carriage
43:42 - The Carriage is the thing that holds the
43:43 - paper on the typewriter it's being
43:46 - carried and the carriage returns after
43:49 - it's being typed on you go click click
43:52 - click click click and the carriage moves
43:54 - and then you have to push the carriage
43:56 - return
43:57 - which then
43:58 - goes Bing and Returns the carriage to
44:02 - its previous location and then the Line
44:04 - Feed moves the paper those codes were
44:07 - needed to move the typewriter so if
44:09 - you're learning git on free code camp
44:12 - and you're wondering why am I thinking
44:14 - about Carriage returns and line feeds in
44:16 - 2024 it's because 50 years ago they were
44:19 - needed to move the paper on the printer
44:23 - and honestly it goes back almost 60 or
44:24 - 70 years yeah I mean so many
44:27 - of the systems we have in place today
44:29 - are just the result of Legacy like the
44:32 - I've heard that the width of Roads or of
44:35 - railroads is because that's how wide
44:37 - Roman roads were 2,000 years ago so they
44:40 - just even though it would probably be
44:41 - better for the railroads to be a little
44:43 - bit wider so they would derail less
44:45 - often that was the standard and you know
44:48 - it was too much work to get people to
44:50 - adopt a whole new standard so they've
44:52 - just had the same standard in place for
44:53 - 2,000 years so I went to my buddy my
44:56 - buddy's house house and he had a Pentium
44:58 - an old Pentium computer and we loaded up
45:01 - a copy of Dos 6 uh from the mid I want
45:06 - to say
45:07 - 1989 1980 1990 and we copied um this
45:12 - onto an uh onto an IDE I think it's
45:15 - integrated Drive something IDE uh we
45:18 - copied onto a an IDE drive with a
45:20 - compact flash card apparently compact
45:22 - flash is the bridge I was thinking USB I
45:25 - was thinking floppies but compact flash
45:27 - or CF cards that you see like in a big
45:29 - fancy camera those are the best cards
45:32 - there are because there's like tiny
45:34 - versions and there's like 64 gig
45:36 - versions and he uses compact flash to
45:38 - move his things around and we recovered
45:40 - the data off of those 40-year-old discs
45:43 - that Ray Aussie gave us and now I'm
45:45 - going to work with uh Microsoft and IBM
45:48 - to try to get the the data that is on
45:50 - those discs from Ray Aussie's uh garage
45:53 - and have that open sourced that's really
45:55 - cool so you're participating directly in
45:58 - computer history like you go to Silicon
46:00 - Valley uh Mountain View the Computer
46:02 - History Museum which I went to earlier
46:03 - this year uh and like you're one of the
46:07 - people that is kind of like playing a
46:09 - small part in helping preserve and uh
46:14 - discover like different quirks because
46:16 - everything was moving so fast things
46:18 - were happening so fast right said he
46:19 - wants me to talk to the Computer History
46:21 - Museum so I want to frankly if I can
46:23 - someday I want to fly to Ray's house
46:26 - take my buddy
46:27 - uh with me and we'll go and like dump
46:29 - everything out of his garage because
46:31 - that's that's that's important history
46:32 - so that actually is another call back to
46:34 - like this your your interest and my
46:36 - interest in Retro Gaming preserving and
46:39 - understanding history matters and if you
46:42 - are a person who does free code camp and
46:45 - you maybe you're an emerging engineer or
46:46 - you're a career switcher or you're a
46:48 - young person who's getting started
46:50 - knowing a little bit about the why you
46:52 - don't have to know all this stuff you
46:54 - know these are two weirdos on a podcast
46:56 - talking about old stuff but like just a
46:59 - little bit of like read a Wikipedia page
47:01 - Ah that's what carriage return is didn't
47:03 - know that huh you would be surprised how
47:06 - often little weird stuff comes up oh why
47:09 - is this thing that way why is HTML like
47:11 - this JavaScript why does JavaScript suck
47:15 - because that's what happened because
47:16 - Brendan wrote it in a weekend and now
47:18 - it's the language we have right those
47:21 - little bits of History uh will go will
47:24 - make you go hm ain't that a thing
47:27 - yeah well you're a big advocate of like
47:29 - staying humble and and just learning
47:31 - about the world around you not
47:33 - presuming
47:34 - uh how have you cultivated those
47:37 - faculties like uh I guess are there any
47:40 - things like any humanistics or or
47:43 - general rules that you apply to like
47:46 - guide your learning and how do you I
47:48 - guess how do you know when to stop
47:49 - learning and stop going too deep in the
47:50 - rabbit hole because you've got to go get
47:51 - some of the work done that's a good
47:55 - question I think when I get a headache
47:57 - that's usually a time to take a break
47:59 - you know what I mean like you can't know
48:01 - everything like I like I go to my I went
48:03 - to my buddy Jeff's house and like he was
48:05 - helping me figure this stuff out and
48:07 - like you I'm a pretty smart guy like I'm
48:09 - like a like a seven and like this guy's
48:12 - freaking nine or 10 like I just he's
48:14 - just vibrating with knowledge you know
48:17 - like when you meet someone who's just so
48:19 - smart it like it must hurt to carry that
48:21 - brain around you know your back must
48:23 - hurt from carrying your giant brain yeah
48:25 - um it's always cool to hang out with and
48:27 - surround yourself with smarter people
48:29 - because they'll make you better uh but I
48:31 - know my limitations you know like I can
48:34 - solder but I'm I'm not really good with
48:36 - an osilloscope like I can when they say
48:38 - full stack engineer we always joke about
48:40 - like how far how far down do you go do
48:42 - you make your own chips do you make and
48:44 - design your own chips do you smelt your
48:46 - own Iron you know what I mean like are
48:48 - you going to go to like a Renaissance
48:49 - Fair get a big rock and turn it into a
48:51 - chip like how I just wanted to say hello
48:53 - world right like I went to free Coke
48:55 - Camp I want to say hello world but did
48:57 - you did you find a rock like and smell
49:00 - you like yeah how what is a full stack
49:02 - engineer anyway you know yeah I mean we
49:03 - we kind of have to practically draw the
49:05 - line at okay you know how to use
49:06 - scripting languages operating systems
49:07 - database Version Control these kind of
49:10 - more contemporary tools but you know I
49:13 - always tell people like it's it's like
49:16 - an ocean history systems knowledge
49:19 - things like that you can absolutely
49:21 - explore it all you probably have time in
49:23 - your life to become very learned about
49:25 - these things but but for most people
49:28 - there the Practical reality is they want
49:30 - to be able to get a job as a developer
49:33 - exactly so finding that balance that's a
49:34 - great point when do you stop when you
49:36 - don't think it's going to help you find
49:37 - a job yeah and so that's a good balance
49:41 - yeah one of the things I'm curious about
49:42 - is like how you got your first job in
49:45 - Tech especially not having a University
49:47 - degree living in Portland which you know
49:49 - is a city with a lot of industry but is
49:51 - not historically like Silicon Valley or
49:54 - Seattle or Austin Texas or or I guess I
49:57 - should say Dallas Texas since we're
49:58 - talking about the old the old Texas
50:00 - silicon Prairie right Portland Portland
50:02 - in the 90s had pretty decent Tech like I
50:05 - say tetronics was there Nike was there
50:07 - intel was there oh okay I didn't realize
50:09 - intel was there yeah yeah Intel is a
50:12 - huge huge Intel campus just like down
50:14 - down the street um but I ended up
50:17 - working I think my first tech job well
50:20 - so I had a little tiny business though
50:23 - because people would carry before before
50:25 - the cloud
50:27 - people would carry their homework around
50:28 - on Diss and you'd have a disc and then
50:31 - you would end up losing your homework
50:34 - and there was a program called disk
50:36 - doctor that would go and you know rip
50:39 - your it would recover your deleted
50:41 - homework so I would charge people five
50:43 - bucks to run disk doctor on their discs
50:46 - and I ended up calling that company
50:48 - tweak computer support and you can go
50:51 - and find um mouse pads and business
50:54 - cards from my my company and then I made
50:56 - a bulletin board which was a pre-
50:58 - interet place that you could call in and
51:00 - leave messages for your friends and I
51:02 - had tweak computer support BBS bullettin
51:05 - board system yeah that was all like done
51:08 - in my parents garage and those were like
51:10 - registered businesses when I was like 15
51:12 - or 16 so that hobby work that just weird
51:16 - stuff people don't give themselves
51:19 - credit for not being for being able to
51:20 - put that on their resume like if you
51:22 - made your Church's website or you made
51:24 - an app for your kids Little League
51:27 - that's resume you know you do a you do a
51:29 - thing for free code Camp you do a
51:31 - certification that goes on the resume
51:33 - you know there's a problem there was a
51:35 - guy at uh at Quiznos small business
51:38 - owner I would go to quos to get a
51:40 - sandwich and he wanted to be able to
51:41 - take orders over the Internet so I made
51:44 - him a internet ordering system because
51:46 - he's just a small business owner like
51:47 - Quiznos is a franchise but I solved that
51:50 - put it on the resume you know what I
51:52 - mean like those little moments all add
51:54 - up and then being able to have stories
51:56 - so a tutorial that you did a little
51:58 - problem that you made a little funny
52:00 - robot all of those things are the
52:02 - stories that build up who you are so
52:03 - that when you go to the interview you
52:05 - can talk about those things and you can
52:07 - you know come off as somewhat credible
52:09 - so I got an internship at a company
52:12 - called Chrome data that did um make
52:15 - model style car data and you would call
52:19 - Chrome data and say I want a
52:21 - Carfax and then we would go and generate
52:24 - a Word document and then fax it to you
52:27 - I built that and I think they were
52:28 - paying me 10 bucks an hour and I
52:30 - remember sitting at at at Quiznos uh
52:33 - asking my boss for a $2 raise to get
52:35 - from $10 an hour to $12 an
52:38 - hour um and I was doing work in C C++
52:41 - and then Visual Basic 3 at the time this
52:44 - would have been like 1992 or
52:46 - three yeah wow Quiznos I love Quiznos
52:49 - but they don't have any here in Dallas
52:51 - in fact I've heard the quiz nose kind of
52:53 - like fell off so to speak uh but that's
52:57 - so cool that you were able to create uh
52:59 - a system because you know those
53:00 - franchises like they don't necessarily
53:02 - get the best support from corporate and
53:05 - to a lot of maybe he requested to
53:07 - corporate hey can we have an ordering
53:09 - system and nobody listened yeah at that
53:11 - time uh he was a it was a it was a guy
53:13 - who poured his entire life savings into
53:15 - a sandwich shop I'm a big fan of small
53:17 - businesses I know you wouldn't think of
53:19 - Quiznos as one but like franchise owners
53:21 - are small business owners so I always
53:24 - befriend the people at the shops and try
53:26 - to help them with whatever so uh I did a
53:29 - lot of menu I did menus at Ethiopian
53:31 - restaurants they needed like cuz
53:33 - Ethiopian is a really interesting
53:34 - language and they have their own their
53:36 - own character set and their own font so
53:38 - he had been writing the menus in English
53:40 - on like word and then in pen drawing the
53:44 - characters I was like no we can solve
53:45 - this let's let's find a font you know
53:47 - what I mean like little problems like
53:49 - that all add up and get put on the
53:50 - resume yeah that's cool so you were
53:53 - basically like kind of like the the
53:55 - Swiss army knife kid
53:57 - around town who would just like did were
54:01 - would business owners talk to one
54:02 - another would they be like hey just call
54:04 - and Scott he could probably figure it
54:05 - out like yeah that that that actually
54:07 - end up happening like even even now at
54:11 - like people will just there's a guy I've
54:13 - been helping I don't even think he knows
54:14 - that I'm a VP at Microsoft and he'll
54:16 - just text me and be like the printer is
54:18 - not working and I've been helping this
54:19 - guy and his family for like 20 years so
54:21 - I'll just go over and I'll just like fix
54:22 - the printer that's cool you know what I
54:24 - mean he he's the this this nice young
54:26 - young man works at Microsoft well
54:29 - obviously like I I want to get through
54:31 - the autobiographical stuff because I
54:32 - know there's like so many actional
54:34 - insights we can pull out of you uh as
54:36 - you and I are both fans of saying I
54:39 - believe because I've listened to a lot
54:40 - of episodes of Hansel minutes you know
54:42 - people's advice is very much informed by
54:44 - their own lived experience who they are
54:47 - uh you
54:49 - know how people treat me is different
54:51 - than how they're going to treat you know
54:54 - a person who just came from a different
54:55 - country and has limited command of
54:57 - English or something like that right or
54:59 - uh all these different
55:01 - dimensions I'm curious though like what
55:04 - your progression was your career
55:07 - progression so you went from being kind
55:08 - of Mr Fix It like
55:11 - uh technology like systems design kid
55:15 - yeah kind of an IT support person for
55:18 - for the neighborhood yeah yeah so that's
55:19 - a great point I like that question so
55:22 - yeah your it support for the
55:23 - neighborhood you're asking questions
55:25 - about toasters and printers and wires
55:28 - and like like you know I was holding up
55:30 - this this ribbon cable before for the
55:32 - floppy like this was a time when you
55:35 - could when each one of these wires had
55:38 - signal on it that you could take apart
55:40 - and look at like you could see data
55:43 - we're not we're not in a time right now
55:44 - where you can see data moving from place
55:45 - to place it's all kind of in the air
55:48 - that's what they tell you but in fact
55:50 - you can get a flipper zero or you can
55:52 - get a you can look at signals like I was
55:54 - a big believer from early on that
55:57 - nothing is
55:58 - invisible so right now people you know
56:01 - you you push a button and a miracle
56:03 - happens or you talk to Siri and a
56:05 - miracle happens and we believe that
56:07 - these things are invisible systems
56:09 - thinkers and myself try to remind
56:11 - ourselves that there's there's visible
56:14 - observable signals whether they be in
56:16 - the air or on a wire on a piece of
56:18 - silicon or in an application like
56:22 - Postman that lets you look at HTTP or
56:25 - when you press F12 in Chrome and you're
56:28 - like oh look at that I can see the the
56:29 - source code that's a reminder that
56:32 - nothing is hidden from you so I think
56:35 - that
56:36 - that was built up by fixing floppies and
56:40 - plugging in network cables and then
56:42 - building my way up to um going to PCC
56:45 - Portland Community College learning how
56:47 - to write hello world in C with Charles
56:51 - pet solds Windows book and then going
56:53 - and presenting that in a somewhat comp
56:56 - competent this kid's got Moxy kind of a
56:59 - way so like enthusiasm can't be faked
57:05 - you know what I mean try to truly be gen
57:07 - you
57:08 - genuinely uh excited about what you're
57:10 - doing and people will be like ah yeah
57:12 - this I like this kid my my nephew uh is
57:16 - 21 he's in the middle of a degree in
57:18 - electrical engineering and he got an
57:21 - internship just based on wow this kid's
57:24 - excited and fascinated about about
57:27 - electrical engineering and systems so
57:29 - you know interviewing well means
57:31 - practicing he did a lot of practice
57:33 - interviews I did a lot of practice
57:35 - interviews um I think it can be really
57:37 - challenging a lot of people feel like I
57:39 - don't interview well yeah because you
57:42 - just over get over over stimulated
57:45 - overthinking so I try to you know teach
57:47 - my kids my young my young Sons 16 and 18
57:50 - to talk to humans because that's a
57:52 - muscle like being an introvert's a thing
57:55 - you know you know but you can train
57:57 - yourself to also be an introvert who can
58:01 - turn on for a half an hour and make it
58:03 - work don't you think like interview
58:05 - skills I think are not talked about
58:08 - enough yeah um I I almost feel like you
58:13 - know as somebody who I guess identifies
58:15 - as an introvert myself like extroversion
58:17 - is a muscle and uh you can build it up
58:21 - and and you can go to that party and you
58:23 - can be uh you know an interesting
58:26 - interested person for two three four
58:29 - five hours and you gradually build up to
58:32 - that over time and then you can recharge
58:34 - you can just go you know watch your
58:36 - reruns of like 1980s TV shows and read
58:40 - old books or play retro games do
58:42 - whatever it is that you do when you're
58:43 - by yourself to just decompress and and
58:47 - uh I guess re-energize so exactly yeah
58:50 - that's that's good advice I want to talk
58:52 - a little bit about your kids if you
58:53 - don't mind me prying a little bit
58:55 - because you're a dad I'm a dad my kids
58:58 - are exactly 10 years younger than yours
59:00 - I've got one with six and one with eight
59:03 - um what are your kids into and
59:06 - like how active have you been in trying
59:09 - to encourage them to learn about
59:10 - technology versus just letting them
59:12 - explore for
59:14 - themselves they are not interested in
59:18 - computers uh which is fine they are
59:21 - certainly competent users but you know
59:25 - the 16-year-old is into football and
59:27 - he's into business he's got a small
59:29 - business um and the 18-year-old is into
59:32 - comic books and art and neither of them
59:34 - have any interest in computers and I
59:36 - haven't tried to fo them foist it on
59:39 - them I haven't tried to like force them
59:41 - to do it because it's just not their
59:42 - thing yeah yeah I'm similarly like my
59:46 - kids are like too into or my daughter's
59:48 - too into computer she'll like grab my
59:50 - laptop and like start googling things uh
59:53 - and it's kind of
59:54 - terrifying so I have to like change the
59:56 - passwords on all my computers to keep
59:58 - her from like using my computer secretly
60:01 - um but
60:02 - yeah I am curious
60:05 - like what are the main things that
60:08 - you've tried to impart to them a as a
60:10 - dad like in terms of preparing them for
60:13 - the world out there because you've taken
60:15 - somewhat of an unconventional path that
60:17 - worked well for you and and similar for
60:20 - for me uh though I always tell everybody
60:22 - don't be a fool stay in school I myself
60:25 - kind of w was a fool and dropped out
60:27 - early on and uh I I don't think that
60:30 - that was the smart call and I think that
60:32 - that like I kind of succeeded in spite
60:34 - of a lot of my early mistakes rather
60:36 - than thanks to my early mistakes um are
60:41 - there
60:42 - any kind of like General lessons you've
60:46 - tried to impart to your kids so
60:49 - far that's a tough one I think it's
60:51 - challenging because when you have
60:54 - succeeded in spite of something in spite
60:56 - of going you know like I like you've
60:57 - just pointed out that yeah you dropped
61:00 - out and I dropped out and I tried an
61:01 - unconventional path kids can use that as
61:04 - evidence of like see you know I don't
61:06 - have to do this the right way I think
61:09 - that school college exists to learn how
61:13 - to learn that's all I got out of college
61:15 - was I learned how to learn um if you
61:17 - feel that you can learn without you know
61:20 - college then that's great you've got
61:22 - that skill um it is however a a series
61:25 - of of hurdles that people like you to go
61:27 - over and at the end you get paper so
61:31 - certifications are a way to assemble a
61:33 - collection of paper that people will
61:35 - respect and some papers people respect
61:38 - more certainly if you go to Harvard or
61:40 - you know MIT oh my God that paper has
61:42 - letters on it that matter more than that
61:44 - other paper so MIT matters more than PCC
61:49 - right in my case um 10 years into it
61:53 - depending on a lot of things in your
61:55 - identity
61:56 - uh you're the the school that you went
61:58 - to matters less you know 10 years into
62:01 - it people don't don't ask but people do
62:03 - get master's degrees so that they might
62:05 - be respected people get phds and remind
62:08 - people that they have a PhD so that they
62:11 - might um be be respected and listened to
62:15 - and that's that's valuable it's
62:16 - complicated it's complicated like you
62:18 - made the point out if you don't speak
62:19 - English or you're an underrepresented
62:21 - group you might feel more pressure to
62:23 - get a degree so that people will respect
62:25 - you and as someone who's an old white
62:27 - dude people are going to go and say I
62:29 - don't even know where where Scott went
62:31 - to school I just assume he's smart cuz
62:32 - he's been doing this for 30 years right
62:34 - when in fact I've been coasting on charm
62:36 - for decades Quincy um and you know
62:39 - someone's going to figure it out that I
62:40 - have no idea what I'm talking about do
62:42 - you do you in all seriousness do you
62:44 - feel like impostor syndrome at this
62:47 - point still in your career oh yeah um
62:51 - yeah God I've written I've written about
62:52 - it it's i i i oscillate Wild wildly
62:56 - between I'm amazing and they should pay
62:58 - me more and I have no idea and I just
63:02 - want to see if I can still have a job
63:04 - this week like that's that's my career
63:06 - is just oscillating back and forth
63:08 - between I'm useless and I know lots and
63:11 - they should they should make me the
63:13 - president um but like you know this
63:15 - floppy thing like there's a there's a
63:19 - class of people there's a there's a
63:20 - there's an age of people where I can
63:21 - blow your minds with the amount of
63:24 - information that I know about computer
63:26 - history and then I go to my buddy Jeff's
63:28 - house and he completely blows me away
63:32 - with how much he knows about this stuff
63:34 - like I thought I was a nine out of 10
63:37 - and I met Jeff and now I'm a seven and
63:40 - he just he's it's a greatting on a curve
63:43 - like you know if you're in a classroom
63:45 - where everyone kind of sucks and you're
63:46 - the a student you're like I'm amazing
63:48 - and then you meet an actual a student
63:50 - and then it's like wh we're just going
63:52 - to go and reset the curve we've we've
63:54 - now met someone who's really tall who
63:57 - can really dunk yeah and you know and
63:59 - Jeff can dunk so like I was like Wow and
64:01 - I'm just so I'm what do I do do I get
64:03 - intimidated no I'm going to just absorb
64:05 - everything I'm just going to suck as
64:06 - much information out of him as possible
64:08 - so that I might become better yeah I
64:11 - 100% that's how when I meet somebody who
64:13 - I think is smarter in an area than I am
64:16 - I go full like suction cup mode I'm like
64:20 - let me have your knowledge right feed me
64:22 - your brains
64:24 - so when one of the things that is
64:26 - different about you and I growing up and
64:28 - and even though you know we're maybe
64:30 - like 10 years apart in age uh I was born
64:32 - in 1980
64:34 - [Music]
64:35 - um nowadays when you grow up you're not
64:38 - competing with the other kids at your
64:40 - high school everything everyone
64:42 - everywhere on the world is on this this
64:44 - big world stage like social media or
64:46 - someplace like that and so you don't
64:48 - have a chance to really build up your
64:50 - confidence like being the smartest kid
64:52 - in class when you know that there are
64:54 - people out there that are dramatic
64:55 - smarter than you are and probably
64:58 - dramatically more successful than you
65:00 - are and better looking and and uh they
65:03 - have better singing voices and all these
65:05 - different attributes that you might
65:06 - compare yourself to them
65:08 - on do you like how would you prepare
65:12 - your kids for a world where you know
65:16 - it's almost impossible to escape
65:18 - comparing yourself to the very best in
65:20 - the world it's no longer about the like
65:22 - Regional championships it's like are you
65:24 - in the NBA or are you not you
65:26 - know
65:28 - um what is it they say comparon is this
65:31 - comparison is the thief of Joy it just
65:34 - cannot be overstated like like the you
65:37 - the algorithm is designed to make you
65:39 - feel like crap right so if you go to
65:42 - Instagram and you get energy and your
65:44 - Instagram and your Tik Tok algorithm is
65:46 - set up to make you feel inspired I have
65:49 - curated my Instagram to be a positive
65:51 - thing but 90% of the time 95% of the
65:54 - time it is is designed to make you feel
65:56 - bad about yourself so why do you keep
65:58 - going back there right like you got to
66:01 - stop comparing yourself to other people
66:03 - and you got to start comparing yourself
66:05 - to
66:06 - yourself yesterday yeah that's the only
66:08 - comparison that matters are you better
66:10 - than you were yesterday good job keep
66:11 - doing that but like there's always going
66:14 - to be some you know that the worst thing
66:15 - man Forbes 30 under 30 yeah I think that
66:19 - thing is toxic I don't like I don't like
66:20 - that ages that they apply to that
66:23 - because it just what purpose does serve
66:26 - other than to make people like in their
66:27 - 40s feel you know like they haven't
66:30 - accomplished much in their time you know
66:32 - I guess maybe yeah yeah um
66:37 - so let's talk about Tik Tok because you
66:41 - have used Tik Tok quite a bit it's a
66:43 - platform that I like was very skeptical
66:45 - of like to this day I don't spend any
66:47 - time there but uh you know you you
66:50 - you're a Creator and you go where the
66:52 - people are and like how do you approach
66:55 - platform like Tik Tok yeah um it's about
67:00 - understanding the algorithm is there uh
67:02 - and it is doing
67:04 - stuff um but it is
67:08 - not its default state is not healthy but
67:12 - you can make it a healthy place I I find
67:14 - Tik Tok to be a very joyful thing um I I
67:19 - have got mine is full of fun things and
67:22 - dancing and education and Woodworking
67:25 - and and it's just a joyful place but it
67:27 - took me like 4 days to get it healthy
67:30 - for me if that makes sense and I think
67:32 - people a lot of people aren't willing to
67:34 - as you probably shouldn't have to to uh
67:36 - to put in that work but but once you do
67:39 - it it is really really cool it's a it's
67:41 - a really fun Joyful Joyful thing yeah um
67:44 - and it also represents all of the
67:46 - diversity of stuff that I'm interested
67:48 - in you know I uh I have I'm I'm not just
67:53 - a programmer I'm not just like a a
67:55 - techie you know like there's like like
67:56 - mine mine has excitement around
67:58 - Beyonce's album you know and it's got uh
68:03 - indigenous dance and it's got uh like I
68:06 - said woodworking 3D printing like all
68:08 - the things that I'm interested in are
68:11 - represented because I have liked the
68:14 - things that I like and I have
68:16 - consciously um hit not interested yeah
68:20 - in the things that I don't like and
68:22 - that's that's a big part of curating
68:24 - your space block lock and move on don't
68:27 - let the
68:28 - haters you know tear you apart and don't
68:31 - let it get you down and if something is
68:33 - getting you down get rid of it yeah
68:36 - that's it's a good approach remove it
68:37 - from your life like don't let random
68:40 - internet people who don't love you ruin
68:43 - your
68:44 - day yeah I mean it it a lot of people
68:46 - created YouTube accounts like 10 15
68:48 - years ago so they may have forgotten
68:49 - that early on like if you go create a
68:51 - brand new YouTube account it's going to
68:53 - be people like who can stop touching
68:55 - this million dooll car like get they win
68:57 - the cars it's it's it's candy versus you
69:00 - know it's calories versus
69:02 - um
69:04 - uh what's what's the thing about like
69:06 - nutritional value you know what I mean
69:08 - like calories yeah and there there's a
69:11 - lot of toxic stuff that'll get
69:12 - recommended to you as well uh but and
69:15 - and I think that's every platform that's
69:17 - just recommendation engines that
69:18 - probably in my humble opinion as a nons
69:22 - sociologist non Anthropologist like that
69:24 - probably has something to do with like
69:26 - how a person who's very late like tired
69:29 - at the end of a long working day and is
69:31 - just looking for some quick
69:32 - entertainment like it probably quickly
69:34 - the recommendation engine probably
69:36 - devolves to like the lowest common
69:38 - denominator so to speak it's not looking
69:40 - to teach you about engineering right he
69:43 - not looking to teach you about uh the
69:46 - history of some technology or to
69:49 - appreciate like art and music and things
69:52 - like that it's probably just looking to
69:53 - get some quick laughs and help you kind
69:55 - of tune out from the uh you know
69:59 - roughness of your day for most people
70:01 - life is not just like this this amazing
70:04 - experience where they people are
70:07 - cramming into the Subways they're
70:08 - cramming in buses people are doing
70:10 - subsistence agriculture all day back
70:12 - breaking work they're working in
70:13 - factories maybe they go outside in the
70:15 - air is like unbreathable right uh there
70:18 - are like all these different you know
70:19 - forms of adversity that people
70:21 - experience and a lot of people just want
70:22 - to escape but if you go to the app it's
70:25 - probably just going to try to give you
70:26 - escapism by default it's not necessarily
70:28 - going to give you actualization which is
70:30 - what you really want right uh it's not
70:32 - GNA give you path to enlightment so
70:35 - anyway sorry for like the long tangent
70:36 - on that but I I think it's really
70:38 - interesting that you've taken kind of
70:40 - like the toxic nature of these
70:42 - recommendation engines uh of these
70:44 - algorithms and kind of like figured out
70:47 - a way to like course correct them yeah
70:49 - if you know what what it's doing and
70:51 - what it wants to do then let it feed you
70:53 - fun things and let it feed you happy
70:55 - things yeah but also I have screen time
70:58 - turned on I'm not joking I've got like
71:00 - 15 minutes of screen time in each of
71:02 - those things and I have to put in a code
71:04 - if you know to uh to get more because I
71:08 - want a reminder like I just lost two
71:10 - hours yeah it's the losing time part
71:12 - that's challenging you don't want to
71:13 - lose a huge amount of
71:15 - time yeah especially from like candy
71:18 - yeah especially while your kids are
71:19 - still living with you and uh you could
71:21 - be spending time with them right
71:23 - priorities that's all about prior and
71:24 - that's really the biggest part about
71:26 - adulting the biggest part about getting
71:28 - into Tech biggest part about all of this
71:29 - stuff is uh are you spending your time
71:33 - doing the things that you should be
71:34 - doing yeah are you spending the time
71:36 - thinking about the things you want to be
71:37 - thinking about learning the stuff you
71:38 - want to learn you've got to you've got
71:40 - to be intentional yeah and
71:43 - intentionality is a huge part of
71:44 - adulting yeah having a plan like you
71:47 - discussed earlier early on you didn't
71:49 - have a plan I didn't have a plan either
71:51 - uh and now it sounds like you got a
71:54 - pretty cohesive plan
71:55 - I want to acknowledge though having a
71:57 - plan is part of it but also
72:00 - acknowledging that I have a direction a
72:02 - general sense of what I'm doing but not
72:04 - a plan yeah I mean like none of my
72:07 - career was planned paying the rent was
72:09 - the goal and paying the rent is a
72:11 - righteous and valid goal yeah 100%
72:14 - getting like if you don't have to be
72:15 - passionate about computers you can just
72:17 - want to have a good job yeah that's okay
72:19 - and we should make sure that you're
72:21 - going to find people online that are
72:23 - going to say if you're not working on
72:25 - software 24/7 if you're not doing it as
72:27 - a hobby then you're not a
72:29 - Craftsman you can just want the money
72:32 - yeah that's okay don't feel sad does
72:35 - that make sense yeah I mean there's a
72:36 - lot of Gatekeepers out there but those
72:37 - people generally are coming from
72:39 - privileged positions where they've had
72:40 - the luxury of getting really into
72:42 - something for the sake of their own
72:44 - personal interest in it throughout most
72:47 - of human history you know you're a
72:49 - farmer are you really that interested in
72:50 - farming some people are I know people
72:52 - that literally buy like Farm simulators
72:54 - and they dream of eventually saving up
72:56 - money to buy acreages so they can be
72:57 - Farmers but I don't think many farmers
73:00 - that are actually out there doing that
73:02 - are that passionate about it for them
73:03 - it's a means to an end you know it's a
73:05 - lifestyle that they Embrace but they'd
73:08 - probably be excited doing something else
73:09 - as well and that's that's totally cool
73:11 - as well and and again you can also
73:13 - switch careers another reminder yeah you
73:16 - know my wife uh has an MBA and did a
73:18 - nonprofit for years she was a finance
73:20 - person and when she was 43 she just woke
73:22 - up one day and she's like this not fun
73:23 - anymore I'm going to do something else
73:26 - yeah so she decided to become a nurse
73:27 - she went back to school she got her
73:30 - degree she became a a 43y old brand new
73:33 - nurse and now she's been doing it for
73:35 - like 10 years and um uh she's been she
73:39 - just the last couple of weeks she's like
73:40 - I think I want to get a PhD so in the
73:42 - next 5 10 years we're going to figure
73:44 - out some way to make that happen very
73:46 - cool you don't have to pick one thing
73:48 - you can always do something else so I I
73:50 - if this Microsoft thing doesn't work out
73:51 - maybe I'll go work at Chick-fil-A or
73:53 - like you know Jack in the Box I know I'd
73:55 - be a good manager yeah yeah I always
73:58 - entertain fantasies going back to
74:00 - running ESL schools because that's what
74:01 - I did before I learned a code that'd be
74:04 - cool so I would be remiss I know we only
74:06 - have a few minutes left I I'm gonna fire
74:08 - off some rapid fire questions because
74:10 - speed yes dating let's go so uh is c a
74:14 - good first language for a beginner to
74:16 - learn like do you think learning C
74:18 - learning uh the net ecosystem is that a
74:21 - good first language or is would that be
74:23 - like a second language and what would
74:25 - you
74:26 - recommend um I think that it is a
74:28 - perfectly cromulent language uh I like
74:31 - to tell people that they should learn
74:32 - two languages JavaScript and a backend
74:36 - language now that backend language could
74:39 - also be JavaScript so you could learn
74:40 - two languages just by learning
74:41 - JavaScript but that means you could
74:43 - learn JavaScript in Python JavaScript in
74:45 - node JavaScript in go rust llang C C++ C
74:51 - I think C is great it's a language that
74:53 - I picked it's my favorite language makes
74:56 - me happy it lets you write websites you
74:59 - can do things in JavaScript like Blazer
75:01 - B a z o r you can write websites you can
75:04 - write uh raspberry pies can run uh C so
75:09 - yeah you can actually go to
75:10 - do. NE the word dot.net and right there
75:15 - on the homepage you can run C in the
75:17 - browser and try it out see what makes
75:19 - you happy um and then it doesn't
75:22 - preclude you from learning another one
75:23 - so yes good good Lang which to learn
75:25 - awesome and if someone's let's say
75:27 - they're already like a seasoned Java
75:29 - developer or they're a season Ruby on
75:30 - Rails developer they're used to doing
75:31 - full stack development and they just
75:33 - started a new job where they're working
75:35 - with the c ecosystem or they're starting
75:37 - a new project and they are interested in
75:39 - potentially using C uh as their like
75:43 - tool of choice for building this entire
75:45 - you know sophisticated app how would you
75:48 - recommend they first get started like
75:50 - they've already got a lot of knowledge
75:51 - that they can potentially transfer over
75:52 - if you're like a Java programmer or
75:54 - you're already in it um I'm a big fan of
75:57 - just making a portfolio website like
75:59 - make a homepage make some brochure make
76:01 - a business card but the other thing to
76:04 - make you feel more
76:07 - um more passionate uh is to pick a
76:10 - problem like uh you mentioned farming uh
76:13 - a buddy of mine's got a little square
76:15 - foot garden out in the back people can
76:18 - actually go and Google for Hanselman
76:19 - square foot gardening for programmers I
76:21 - actually have a whole article about
76:23 - programmer minded square foot gardening
76:25 - and um but they they they got a
76:28 - Raspberry Pi and a soil sensor and they
76:30 - connected it to the Wi-Fi and they made
76:31 - a little web API to tell them whether
76:33 - the moisture and the soil was a certain
76:35 - level that's a thing um I made one that
76:38 - told me if my garage door was open just
76:40 - wrote a little C application to tell me
76:43 - if the Raspberry Pi's orientation was
76:45 - like this because the garage door goes
76:47 - up and then
76:48 - rotates solve a problem and do it in C
76:52 - and that that's a good way for like a
76:53 - Java person to to go and do something
76:55 - like that awesome uh this question comes
76:57 - from Gavin law Big C YouTube creator
77:01 - also works at free Cod camp and teaches
77:02 - some of our courses uh he say he asks
77:06 - people often ask whether Blazer may go
77:09 - the way of silver light and eventually
77:10 - no longer be supported by Microsoft
77:13 - Gavin says he always replies that
77:14 - Microsoft is investing heavily in Blazer
77:16 - but it'd be great to get confirmation of
77:19 - this from you
77:20 - Scott confirmation that Blazer is a good
77:23 - thing or that it's like priority I guess
77:25 - is what he's trying oh yeah Blazer is
77:27 - great 100% it's absolutely a priority it
77:29 - is a really cool front end that lets you
77:32 - write basically websites without
77:35 - learning JavaScript like you can do
77:37 - interactions you can you know make uh
77:39 - grids and tables and sort them and
77:42 - interactions and and you just write it
77:44 - like you're writing a Windows app the
77:46 - Eventing and everything is handled by
77:47 - Blazer so you get cool interactive
77:50 - websites without the stress of
77:52 - JavaScript awesome and then I want to
77:55 - I'd be remissed for not asking you about
77:56 - Microsoft learn this massive library of
77:59 - tutorials that you all have over there
78:00 - oh yeah which we leverage heavily in the
78:02 - C certification uh the the foundational
78:04 - C uh hopefully the first of many C
78:07 - certifications that we're able to
78:08 - publish with you all um what is your
78:12 - level of invel of involvement in
78:14 - developing these uh tutorials and like
78:17 - how many people are on the team like
78:19 - developing these because it seems like
78:20 - an incredible Corpus of tutorials I'm
78:23 - not directly
78:25 - like so Katie on my team helped but like
78:27 - there's a whole team of people making
78:30 - cool uh the cool stuff like this is all
78:35 - uh Beyond me like there's a whole org
78:38 - I'm a partner for the learn team so I'm
78:40 - interested in C and people being excited
78:43 - about C so we partner with the learn
78:45 - team they make certifications they
78:47 - develop courses they revise the courses
78:49 - they make 100 level 200 level 300 level
78:52 - uh courses I don't know how many people
78:53 - are on there many awesome final question
78:56 - an area final question do people make
78:59 - their own
79:03 - luck
79:05 - oh so I don't think people make luck
79:10 - well this is a tough question
79:13 - so I can make
79:15 - luck for other
79:17 - people luck is a a formula which is
79:22 - being prepared Plus
79:25 - an
79:26 - opportunity you can set yourself up to
79:30 - have an opportunity presented for you by
79:32 - changing your position where you are
79:34 - virtually or physically you can be
79:36 - prepared for an opportunity to present
79:38 - itself but you have to have the two
79:40 - things together for example um you could
79:43 - work really hard and learn uh a
79:45 - programming language but then if you sit
79:47 - at home quietly and never tell anyone
79:48 - that you learned it you will not get a
79:50 - lucky phone call it's not possible
79:53 - because there's no opportunity that's
79:54 - going to present itself but if you learn
79:57 - JavaScript at free code camp and then
79:58 - you're sitting on the bus and you start
80:00 - chatting someone up and you find out
80:02 - that they are they own a company and you
80:05 - happen to be ready because you've been
80:06 - practicing then you've now had an
80:08 - opportunity plus being prepared and oh
80:10 - my goodness what a lucky thing that I
80:12 - met so and so and now I have a job yeah
80:15 - right so I can create luck as a person
80:18 - who's more senior by making
80:21 - opportunities so I have the ability to
80:23 - invent and create opportunities and I
80:26 - have the ability to shine a light on
80:28 - people so rather than mentorship I can
80:31 - create sponsorship opportunities by
80:33 - retweeting someone's project giving them
80:35 - a chance to speak on stage and that
80:38 - makes the formula of luck more easy for
80:41 - other people so you who are listening
80:44 - think about ways you can be prepared and
80:46 - think about ways you can either put
80:47 - yourself in a position where an
80:48 - opportunity presents itself or if you
80:50 - are in a position of some power if you
80:53 - have level privilege
80:55 - then how can you uh create opportunities
80:57 - for those who are prepared to create
80:59 - their own luck amen kind of a nuanced
81:02 - answer yeah no it's I I love it uh Scott
81:07 - it's been an absolute pleasure checking
81:09 - out so many of your cool retro Computing
81:10 - projects uh hearing of Your Love of
81:14 - retro video games uh I hope you have a
81:16 - fantastic day and to everyone who uh who
81:21 - enjoyed listening to Scott be sure to
81:22 - check out some of the links I'm going to
81:24 - put some interesting links in the show
81:25 - notes and until next week happy coding
