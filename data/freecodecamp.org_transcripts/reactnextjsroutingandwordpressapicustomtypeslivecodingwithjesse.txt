00:07 - hey everybody its Jesse and uh today
00:12 - we're showing it a lot done
00:15 - and I actually want to try to get
00:17 - through like a whole a whole process
00:23 - usually I just work on random stuff and
00:26 - I don't always get it done so I want to
00:28 - go try to go start to finish and take
00:30 - you through the process of creating a
00:34 - custom post type in WordPress with
00:37 - custom fields populating that with some
00:41 - data getting that data pulling it into a
00:45 - reactor and we're gonna make a template
00:51 - in react to display that data and we
00:55 - want that a user to be able to go to a
00:58 - page and have that page automatically
01:00 - generated with a unique URL so we're
01:04 - gonna need to edit our server j/s file
01:06 - to be able to handle that so I want to
01:10 - get all of that done while I'm streaming
01:15 - so that's a lot of stuff but I've done
01:17 - it I don't want to say a lot but I've
01:22 - done it you know three or four times
01:25 - before you know recently so I think we
01:29 - can get it done I'm gonna check the live
01:36 - chat say hi hey everyone
01:43 - so I apologize in advance if I'm a
01:46 - little weird for this dream because I I
01:49 - only got like five hours of sleep last
01:51 - night
01:53 - so I was up I ended up not being super
01:58 - tired last night so I applied to speak
02:01 - at some conferences which is kind of
02:06 - exciting I've never applied to speak at
02:07 - conferences before so we'll see what
02:11 - happens
02:11 - I don't really know if I if my
02:14 - submissions were even any good because
02:16 - I've never even seen anyone's submission
02:19 - before but hopefully I at least get some
02:26 - good feedback you know even if I get
02:29 - rejected that would be kind of cool if
02:33 - you want to see my um what I submitted
02:37 - to some of the conference's it's
02:38 - available online so check my Twitter I
02:41 - sent out a link last night so that
02:44 - people could actually check out my idea
02:47 - for a talk and then this morning the
02:54 - baby was up really early so anyway that
02:57 - that's why I didn't get sleep but I'm
03:02 - gonna try my best to stay focused I do
03:05 - have one question for you all to start
03:09 - someone asks what my Twitter handle was
03:11 - Jeremy asks it's it's in the description
03:15 - for this show it's just it's Jesse are
03:18 - Weigel so jay esse r w e i GTL
03:29 - and let me I had one problem so I really
03:36 - wanted to get you all a link that you
03:39 - could go to to see all the updates so I
03:42 - started a dev branch that's gonna be
03:44 - like the cutting edge stuff the latest
03:47 - stuff that we're doing for this site and
03:49 - that is going to be updated at our
03:53 - server I don't know if anybody remembers
03:54 - when we set up the load balancing but we
03:58 - actually have three droplets running
04:01 - node and react and we are only a load
04:04 - balancing between two so I never shut
04:06 - down that third droplet because I always
04:09 - thought it would come in handy for
04:10 - testing and today it has come in handy
04:13 - so that's the droplet that I can just
04:17 - give you the IP address for and you all
04:19 - can can check it out now I did get it
04:22 - working but I just tried to update it
04:29 - and for some reason it quit working now
04:31 - here's what I think happened my session
04:34 - timed out when I was used logged into
04:37 - the server and I didn't use usually used
04:41 - p.m. to to start the server but I didn't
04:43 - even set it up I just started it you
04:45 - know with just a regular command just
04:48 - npm run start and I never shut down the
04:50 - server so right now I can't start the
04:52 - new server because port 8080 is already
04:55 - in use so normally I would shut it down
04:57 - by pressing ctrl C right but that
05:00 - doesn't work because at least I don't
05:04 - think it works
05:05 - I can sure you double check but I don't
05:08 - think that's gonna work for me yeah how
05:11 - do you shut down a node server from the
05:14 - command line if it's not actually like
05:18 - the process is not actually running in
05:20 - my command line right now like I'm I
05:21 - can't see it so if anybody knows how to
05:25 - do that let me know and then I can get
05:27 - this up and running and you all can have
05:29 - a place where you can check out all the
05:32 - latest stuff without having to download
05:34 - this repository and run a local server
05:38 - so I
05:40 - I'll figure it out eventually but I just
05:43 - figured maybe somebody is really
05:46 - familiar with node and just knows
05:48 - exactly what command I need okay Patrick
05:53 - did have Patrick had a good comment he
06:01 - asked about the on change event with
06:04 - materialized so okay cool so I've gotten
06:11 - the the command so let's go sudo kill
06:20 - all node is that it
06:38 - which other so anyway yesterday we
06:43 - couldn't I couldn't get this select
06:46 - thing to work and I said that I would
06:50 - let you all know how I ended up getting
06:51 - it to work so let me let me do that now
06:54 - all right cool
06:56 - so that works so if you go to let me
07:00 - find the IP for you
07:05 - I'll paste this IP address in the live
07:09 - chat and it's the IP address is 1 6 2.2
07:18 - 4 3.8 6.67 and maybe if I can remember
07:24 - I'll put it in the shared description so
07:27 - anyway this will show the latest stuff
07:31 - so this will actually show you that this
07:34 - is working now all right so the only
07:37 - thing this is the only thing that
07:39 - actually has a working category right
07:41 - now I'm pretty sure nothing else has
07:44 - been put into categories but that is
07:47 - working I'll show you how I got it
07:48 - working in a second
07:50 - also for some reason these borders on
07:56 - this top one just start coming and going
07:58 - I haven't replaced the borders with hrs
08:01 - yet so I need to do that but I did get
08:03 - this working so I have this little
08:08 - toggle here and this is just changing
08:12 - the state within the component so within
08:15 - the component there's a display content
08:17 - set automatically to false if it's false
08:20 - it displays this when you click it it
08:22 - sets the state to true and displays the
08:26 - Falaise this and this one when you click
08:29 - it it sets the state back to false so
08:33 - let me show you the code for how I got
08:38 - this working and then we'll get started
08:42 - on on what I actually described in the
08:47 - title in the description for this video
08:48 - so
08:51 - within that's material select that's
08:58 - what we have so within material select
09:03 - what I've done is basically just gotten
09:06 - rid of all the materialized stuff so I'm
09:08 - not initializing the materialized I
09:11 - should give some background in case you
09:12 - weren't watching yesterday and you're
09:17 - not sure what I'm talking about I'm
09:20 - using the materialized framework it's a
09:22 - CSS framework it uses some jQuery stuff
09:26 - and changes the Dom so it's not ideal
09:29 - for react but we've made it work so far
09:33 - and this is the only time we've run into
09:36 - an issue where I just couldn't get it to
09:38 - work I was spending way too much time
09:40 - yesterday getting it to work I probably
09:42 - should have given up on it sooner but it
09:46 - just didn't even occur to me during the
09:50 - stream until the very end so what I did
09:52 - normally what materialized does is if
09:54 - you have a select input it goes through
09:57 - all the options and then it creates new
10:00 - Dom nodes for new elements and it
10:02 - creates a new ul and then each option
10:05 - becomes an Li within that ul so that all
10:09 - happens after you know with with jQuery
10:12 - so that's not really registered in react
10:17 - now that wasn't even the main issue so
10:20 - that was one issue but the main issue
10:22 - was that whenever we changed that select
10:30 - input that event wasn't registering for
10:35 - react so when I try to have this on
10:37 - change handler to do something it
10:42 - wouldn't do anything it didn't recognize
10:44 - the change it would actually run it was
10:47 - weird it would run twice on render that
10:50 - was because it would actually render
10:52 - once and run and then it would make an
10:56 - API call to populate all these options
10:58 - and then re render and then we'll run
11:00 - another time but then when I actually
11:01 - tried to change
11:02 - the select input to select one of these
11:05 - options it wouldn't fire off an event so
11:09 - that's that's an issue with materialized
11:12 - and and react so I think that the issue
11:16 - is probably on the side of materialized
11:18 - and how it's done it's not I don't think
11:21 - it's a react issue from what I can
11:22 - understand there were some some pool
11:28 - requests to try to fix that but I don't
11:30 - think that it seems like the maintainer
11:31 - zuv materialized don't see that as a bug
11:35 - and they just recommended using the
11:38 - react materialized framework which is an
11:43 - attempt to make materialized work with
11:46 - react and turn everything into react
11:48 - components so so I don't think there's
11:53 - any chance anytime soon of that being
11:56 - changed so just in case you're trying to
11:59 - use materialized as well you can either
12:01 - go the route that I did or you can try
12:04 - to use react materialize instead or try
12:07 - to do some type of custom fix but I'll
12:11 - show you you know basically what I did
12:12 - is now I'm using just a plain select
12:15 - input I did do some extra styling so I
12:19 - could make it fit in so let me show you
12:23 - I mean obviously this doesn't look like
12:26 - your default select input when you click
12:28 - it this looks like browser default right
12:30 - I can't really do much about this
12:33 - browser default and it'll look slightly
12:34 - different depending on the browser but
12:38 - you know assuming I want to stick with a
12:40 - select input and not try to do something
12:41 - some type of custom list which I don't
12:45 - really want to do it right now it would
12:46 - be okay but it would be a lot of work I
12:48 - think for a slight improvement and I'm
12:50 - running out of time to work on this site
12:53 - so I just changed things so that it
12:56 - mimics the look of this search box okay
13:01 - so and how I accomplished that was with
13:07 - all of this it's really big mostly
13:12 - because of all these vendor prefixes
13:15 - which
13:16 - I think if you put things within the
13:18 - style JSX tag it actually Auto prefixes
13:21 - for you but I had copied this over from
13:23 - a previous project where I had figured
13:25 - out everything I need to do to style
13:28 - this in the materialized fashion so I
13:32 - didn't I didn't try to redo that I just
13:34 - copied it over so it's not hurting
13:36 - anything to have the vendor prefixes in
13:37 - there and it's working so I'm not gonna
13:39 - mess with it and then I just needed to
13:41 - add in this this part at the bottom let
13:47 - me bring make this a bit bigger I think
13:49 - is this is a bit smaller than I normally
13:50 - have it so I had to add in this the
13:52 - reason I couldn't put it right here in
13:54 - the style JSX
13:55 - tag was because of this so it thought I
14:00 - was trying to incorrectly escape
14:02 - something within this string because of
14:05 - the slash so it wouldn't work so if you
14:08 - try to use content and then you know one
14:10 - of these this basically makes that that
14:16 - little try upside down triangle they
14:18 - call it a carrot that's the little code
14:22 - to make that so if you're trying to do
14:24 - something like that it won't work in
14:25 - style of JSX so this code is all on
14:32 - github you can check it out under the
14:35 - dev branch so if you want to kind of
14:38 - look into how I did this place it's not
14:43 - really a lot it just looks like a lot
14:45 - because the vendor prefixes and a lot of
14:47 - it is just trying to override browser
14:49 - default things all right so that's
14:53 - pretty much it I'm gonna check the live
14:54 - stream now see if there's any questions
14:57 - about that before we get started
15:05 - okay we have somebody card carnage I'm
15:09 - not sure how to pronounce the name kar
15:11 - IE KR n IE j carnage I don't know
15:16 - sorry about not know not to pronounce
15:18 - that but anyway says hi everybody I'm
15:20 - looking for a job react job so I guess
15:27 - so hopefully you you can pick up some
15:29 - react knowledge on this stream if
15:33 - anything you can probably pick up some
15:37 - mistakes to avoid when you when you do
15:41 - this my stream is really good at
15:43 - demonstrating the pitfalls and mistakes
15:46 - that can be made and sometimes even how
15:48 - to fix them but anyway I'm not sure that
15:53 - anybody watching now or in the live chat
15:56 - is hiring so I don't know that I can
15:57 - help you but anyway I keep keep us
16:03 - updated on the job search I'd love to
16:06 - hear how it goes okay
16:10 - the will Frank says long time viewer
16:13 - first day hey how's it going thanks for
16:17 - saying hi I realized there's probably a
16:19 - lot of people who watch who never speak
16:22 - in a live chat which is totally cool I'm
16:24 - actually am usually pretty quiet and
16:27 - chats and things myself when I'm
16:29 - watching so I totally understand
16:30 - and maybe you're just doing other things
16:32 - and not a computer yours feel like
16:35 - listening or watching
16:36 - but don't be shy if you can if you can
16:40 - say hi that would be cool because I
16:43 - noticed you know there's always the the
16:45 - analytics shows that there's always way
16:48 - more viewers than people talking in the
16:51 - live chat and today we actually have
16:54 - fewer of yours than we've been having
16:56 - normally so I don't know what happened
16:59 - maybe the topic is not great today it's
17:04 - still a decent amount of years though so
17:07 - I think we have like 40 right now which
17:09 - is I mean that's I'm always amazed that
17:12 - anybody wants to watch me cuz
17:15 - forty or forty three now cool person I
17:22 - see react a Fabian how's it going
17:33 - haha Evo says hi Jesse not James's son
17:37 - hey how's it going that yesterday Evo
17:44 - accidentally called me James in the chat
17:46 - which was just fine that it didn't
17:49 - bother me bill says hey it worked but
17:53 - listening in the background today
17:54 - awesome
17:56 - that's that's cool that's why I imagine
17:58 - that's probably a lot of people may be
18:00 - in the same situation especially if
18:02 - they're in a similar time zone to where
18:04 - I'm at because this is the time when
18:06 - people are normally at work
18:19 - John said is it not always with the more
18:22 - simple coding it saves the day all these
18:23 - things like reactor webpack other
18:25 - complex systems for me at least now is
18:28 - overkill yeah I I agree to some extent
18:31 - that I'll react webpack all that stuff
18:36 - increases the complexity and increases
18:39 - the possibility for bugs so if you don't
18:42 - need to use those things for what you're
18:45 - trying to accomplish you you are
18:47 - probably better off not using them but
18:51 - for a lot even you know if you're trying
18:52 - to learn them there's no reason not to
18:55 - do a small project with it because if if
18:57 - your purpose is not just to produce a
19:00 - product if your purpose is to learn then
19:03 - you know make something simple with
19:05 - react I I actually uh a few weeks ago
19:08 - when I was on vacation I built the free
19:11 - code camp weather app I don't know if
19:14 - you all remember that challenge is kind
19:15 - of early on in free code camp challenges
19:17 - but I built that I rebuild it and react
19:20 - I had built it once just with some
19:23 - jQuery and I did it just simply to get
19:26 - some practice and to learn it definitely
19:28 - doesn't need to be built and react but
19:30 - but anyway to speak to John's point that
19:34 - definitely was the case this time with
19:37 - materialize it was trying to do all this
19:39 - other stuff and beyond what a normal
19:42 - select input does and you know the
19:43 - select input that's been in HTML for for
19:46 - years and years worked fine for this use
19:49 - case so it was definitely the solution
19:51 - and better off hey Zanna says hi hey
19:54 - how's it going glad you can watch Jordan
19:59 - asks how do you hook up WordPress with
20:01 - react okay cool I'm going to show you
20:02 - today how we hook up WordPress with
20:05 - react so I'm not going to explain it
20:06 - right now because we're I'll be able to
20:08 - show it to you we're gonna do it during
20:12 - this this stream and I'll start that in
20:15 - just a minute I just wanted to say hi to
20:16 - everybody and you know at the beginning
20:19 - of the live chat before I get get to the
20:22 - code ego says John if you have this many
20:28 - modules of stuff to keep track of a tool
20:30 - like web pack is a lifesaver react
20:32 - is also really nice and I think that
20:33 - they will become even more prevalent
20:35 - yeah that's true that's a good point you
20:39 - know like if your project is complex it
20:42 - ends up helping to have things like
20:44 - react and webpack like yesterday I
20:47 - showed you all that I think it was
20:49 - yesterday I showed you all that mess
20:51 - that was the the jQuery site that I had
20:54 - made which basically did a lot of the
20:56 - same stuff that this site does but I
20:58 - built it all with jQuery and it was just
21:00 - a bunch of crazy spaghetti code and it's
21:02 - really hard to maintain now I really
21:05 - can't wait until I have the time to
21:07 - rebuild that in react
21:08 - so in that case using something simpler
21:13 - than react which was I would argue that
21:16 - jQuery is probably simpler than react at
21:18 - least it's simpler to learn but that
21:23 - ended up being worse as the project got
21:26 - more complex so I think there ends
21:28 - there's a tipping point in the project
21:30 - of you know where some of these tools
21:35 - actually do end up helping Zanna asks
21:41 - did you debug it Zen are you talking
21:45 - about the the select input thing that
21:48 - was happening so I don't know maybe you
21:51 - might have joined in right after I
21:52 - explained it so sorry if you missed it
21:56 - but basically yeah I did get it working
21:57 - and I just went with a normal select
21:59 - input so I just got rid of the stuff
22:04 - that materialized was glowing and just
22:05 - went with a normal select input
22:06 - everything worked fine and I just did
22:08 - some styling to make it look like it was
22:14 - it fit with the materialize styling
22:23 - all right so think I'm gonna I'm gonna
22:26 - scan through quickly the rest to see on
22:28 - the live chat and then I'm gonna get
22:29 - started
22:38 - okay bill bill said he watched the
22:42 - replays of the last two streams and at
22:44 - one point in yesterday's streams I
22:46 - accidentally showed his project instead
22:49 - of my project and he says it's cool
22:52 - though because it was on github as
22:53 - open-source so yeah sorry about that I
22:55 - mean I'm glad that it's cool and
22:57 - everything but I'll have to be more
22:59 - careful about double-checking what I
23:01 - show I try to keep everything that
23:05 - shouldn't be shown on my other screens
23:19 - okay so they all go asks about the Auto
23:24 - prefixing the CSS inside the JSX
23:28 - I'm not sure I think the I think if you
23:33 - use next J s the Auto prefixing
23:36 - everything comes built-in so I I don't
23:44 - know I have to check it out I just
23:46 - always assumed it was Auto prefixing I
23:48 - thought I saw that before in my code
23:50 - that it was all in a prefix but now that
23:53 - I really think about it I would have to
23:54 - double check to say 100% for sure so
23:57 - don't take my word for it without
23:59 - double-checking but I'm pretty sure it
24:02 - does get Auto prefixed as long as it's
24:04 - inside the style da J or the style JSX
24:07 - tags okay okay so Zanna did didn't hear
24:11 - the explanation the beginning so I gave
24:14 - us a slightly longer explanation and I
24:16 - showed the code so Zanna if you if you
24:19 - get a chance later on you can watch like
24:21 - the first 10 minutes of the stream or
24:22 - something the recording and get a longer
24:27 - explanation
24:44 - okay I'll wait - Patrick centerlink
24:48 - what's the link Patrick I'll check it
24:51 - out of my sheep
25:02 - okay
25:10 - that's weird okay so this should check
25:14 - this out I'm probably not gonna fix this
25:19 - right now I'll do it later since I want
25:21 - to do something else on the stream but
25:23 - Patrick just sent this
25:24 - so what browser was that that's it on
25:26 - Ubuntu with with chrome okay
25:33 - well that's no good so I'll have to work
25:39 - on that Danny but if anybody else
25:43 - checked this out let me know if you're
25:46 - having anything similar happening
25:51 - obviously like Chrome on a Mac it looks
25:55 - like this it works blown on Ubuntu it
25:59 - looks like this I mean I really want it
26:03 - to work but realistically there's
26:06 - probably no actual user of this site
26:09 - who's like in the target audience that
26:11 - would be using Ubuntu so if that's the
26:13 - only place where this happens I probably
26:15 - won't worry about it just because I
26:19 - don't have a lot of time yet so I gotta
26:21 - worry about you know the other browsers
26:24 - more browser
26:27 - operating system combinations more but
26:31 - yeah I'm gonna have to take a look at
26:33 - that although I really won't have a good
26:35 - way to test it because I don't I don't
26:37 - have Kubuntu and I don't even think you
26:41 - can test that on browser stack off to
26:45 - check I don't think you can test it on
26:46 - Linux let's see
26:57 - okay Patrick just said the same thing
27:01 - that there's not a lot of site people
27:03 - going to the site with Linux okay it's
27:08 - good to know the and I'm definitely
27:10 - going to check it out with some other
27:12 - combinations of operating systems and
27:16 - browsers devices to make sure that
27:18 - there's not similar errors happening
27:20 - elsewhere so thanks for sending that so
27:28 - Oh actually I did want to before I
27:31 - started I wanted to mention a little bit
27:35 - about the net neutrality thing that's
27:37 - happening so especially for those in in
27:42 - the United States right now there's like
27:46 - some the federal government has some
27:50 - stuff going on where basically it could
27:52 - end up being really bad for the internet
27:54 - like things could be blocked like so I
28:00 - wanted to show some of you may have
28:04 - already seen this but there's these
28:07 - videos that are they're really short so
28:10 - I think I'm just going to show this
28:11 - video quickly this net neutrality video
28:13 - which we'll be able to kind of explain
28:14 - things a lot better than I can and let
28:22 - me try to bring this over I think it's
28:25 - just only a few minutes so let me throw
28:31 - this on here yeah oh it's not even it's
28:34 - 33 seconds so
29:03 - okay so anyway that was just a really
29:07 - basic of what's happening so if you're
29:12 - if you're interested and just putting
29:15 - your name out there as being against
29:18 - this then you know check out the the URL
29:22 - which was battle for the Netcom so and
29:32 - today is like the official day I think
29:34 - where a lot of stuff is happening to
29:37 - raise awareness and kind of protest that
29:40 - possibility of the internet being you
29:43 - know way more regulated by companies and
29:48 - different than it than it is now and
29:50 - then it probably should be alright let's
29:58 - see I just want to check the live chat
30:02 - really quick to see what other errors
30:05 - you are getting
30:09 - okay so Windows 10 in chrome is the same
30:13 - issue so okay so Evo says Evo's found
30:24 - the error already which is awesome thank
30:26 - you so much you have a color value of
30:28 - inherit in the CSS rule button for input
30:31 - select area which comes from
30:33 - materialized okay alright so evidently
30:36 - there's something being being applied
30:40 - from materialize the materialized
30:43 - framework that's affecting that so
30:51 - oh so I'll check that out
31:06 - okay let me open post the link to the
31:08 - dev site again for for those either came
31:12 - in a little bit later so I have a 1/3
31:19 - droplet now that's running the dev
31:22 - branch so I'll try to keep it updated
31:25 - with the latest dev stuff so until I get
31:29 - approval for the changes from the people
31:33 - higher up than they I'm not gonna make
31:35 - them since they're really significant
31:37 - changes for for a lot of pages I'm not
31:40 - I'm not just gonna try to make them live
31:42 - on my own I need to get some approval
31:44 - first so for now they're gonna exist
31:47 - only on this at this IP address and okay
31:54 - cool Evo is gonna open a github issue
31:57 - with an explanation of what's going on
32:00 - with that select input so I'll
32:03 - definitely check that out and actually
32:07 - if anyone is kind of shaky with the
32:10 - JavaScript skills but is really good
32:11 - with their CSS that will probably end up
32:14 - being a CSS only solution that might be
32:19 - good to contribute so otherwise I mean
32:21 - I'm I'm sure it'd only take me a few
32:23 - minutes to figure it out
32:24 - but especially for new people who are
32:27 - trying to get some some more things on
32:30 - the github profile that might be kind of
32:32 - an easy thing to do so enough of this
32:38 - we're gonna work on something totally
32:40 - different so I'm gonna move this off the
32:44 - screen and I'm gonna do this off the
32:47 - screen and what a bunch of stuff off the
32:50 - screen I can keep this on the screen
33:01 - also yesterday one more thing just
33:08 - continuing from yesterday yesterday I
33:11 - had a pool request from Rene which
33:14 - switched over to using pre-act instead
33:18 - of react and it made things smaller the
33:21 - bundle size for production was smaller a
33:23 - lot smaller so when I tried to use it on
33:28 - this test server I was getting an error
33:31 - I was saying R is not a function so I'm
33:37 - not sure what was going on it worked
33:39 - fine locally but when I tried to
33:41 - actually build it and run it I was
33:43 - getting there so I ended up not merging
33:47 - that pool request I didn't accept it yet
33:49 - I'm not saying I won't accept it but I
33:51 - just need to get it working on the
33:53 - actual server first so so I added I
34:00 - added that to to the actual pool request
34:07 - I added a comment about it so if anybody
34:10 - has any ideas for that you know please
34:13 - you know comment there on that on that
34:18 - pool request on github ok so today what
34:25 - we're gonna do
34:26 - let's start with WordPress first so I'm
34:29 - gonna do I'm gonna start here in our
34:33 - WordPress plugin
34:34 - so you've probably seen this before
34:38 - this is a wordpress plugin that we're
34:40 - using to make a bunch of custom post
34:43 - types so here's what we what we need to
34:46 - do here's the the kind of the end goal
34:48 - for the user the user needs to be able
34:51 - to click on a link that will be like the
34:57 - title of a PDF document right so in the
35:01 - about page we're going to create
35:03 - something to display these links some
35:05 - new section but I don't want them to
35:09 - just link to PDF documents right because
35:11 - that's that's no good for
35:14 - search engine optimization I'm not
35:16 - really sure how screen readers handle
35:17 - that so I'd rather have these PDFs
35:20 - converted into HTML but I also want the
35:25 - PDFs available to download so I'd like a
35:26 - user to be able to go to the about page
35:28 - see a list of the titles of these PDFs
35:31 - click on it when they click it opens up
35:34 - an entirely new page on a react site
35:38 - that has the contents of that PDF in
35:43 - HTML and then also has a button to be
35:48 - able to download the PDF and I want that
35:52 - all to be editable from within WordPress
35:55 - so we're gonna make a custom post type I
35:59 - guess a PDF page post type and it needs
36:04 - to have your normal title and content
36:08 - fields which are there by default but
36:11 - then we're gonna add one custom field
36:12 - that's going to be the URL of the PDF
36:19 - and actually we should probably might
36:22 - want to do the title field should be
36:26 - good I kind of thought maybe we might
36:28 - want to do a separate field for PDF
36:30 - title but I think the title field should
36:32 - be enough that we could pull into use
36:34 - for the link text so that should that's
36:39 - all we need to do on the wordpress side
36:41 - and then we'll come in we'll build the
36:44 - the page that that's going to be
36:46 - populated we'll build out the section
36:49 - that needs to be in the about page and
36:52 - then we'll update our code in our server
36:55 - das file to direct people to the right
37:02 - place and make the right API call to get
37:06 - that data so let me
37:13 - copy so I think you you I've done this
37:19 - before on a stream so I'm just gonna
37:22 - copy this did I get the I don't know if
37:26 - I got the top part so I'm doing it again
37:28 - so I'm going to copy this and paste it
37:30 - now I'm just gonna change all of these
37:43 - and I wanted to say instead what did I
37:48 - say was a PDF PDF page yeah I think
37:56 - that'll I think that'll be obvious to
38:00 - the people who are editing it what I
38:02 - would that is okay so this is how it
38:07 - will display these are all the display
38:08 - names that'll be like in the WordPress
38:10 - admin panel and then these are the names
38:15 - that'll be in the code so let's make PDF
38:38 - all right so now I'm gonna say that oops
38:42 - actually I'm not gonna save it okay copy
38:45 - this let me bring over my WordPress
38:50 - admin panel here so I need to login I
38:57 - just let me bring this over and I need
39:01 - to upgrade to the newest version so I
39:04 - was just waiting to do a backup so I
39:06 - have one of my co-workers purchase a
39:10 - subscription for this backup plug-in
39:12 - that we can use on and I think an
39:14 - unlimited amount of site so I'm just
39:15 - waiting to get the info about how to
39:18 - install that because generally you don't
39:21 - want to really do too many updates on a
39:23 - wordpress site without backing it up
39:24 - I've done a lot of updates on small
39:27 - sites without backing up and I've never
39:29 - actually had anything happen but it's a
39:32 - good practice to to do the backups if
39:36 - you can so you can manually you don't
39:40 - need a plug-in you can manually do the
39:42 - backups but I don't have like PHP
39:45 - myadmin installed or anything like that
39:47 - so I just I don't really feel like doing
39:49 - the backups from the command line and
39:50 - I'm not even sure I have SSH access to
39:53 - this droplet so let's go actually that I
40:00 - have no idea why that I've keeping this
40:03 - so small we'll make it a bit bigger and
40:05 - I'll increase the size so y'all can see
40:08 - what's going on so I'm gonna go into
40:10 - plugins here and I'm gonna find I passed
40:18 - it up there you see I custom types
40:21 - that's our plug-in and I'm gonna edit
40:24 - now if I did have I don't I don't really
40:27 - have any access to this server either
40:30 - FTP access or SSH for some reason the
40:34 - accesses and it isn't working I didn't
40:37 - set this up someone else set it up and
40:39 - so I just never figured out what the
40:42 - issue was so this is why I'm updating
40:43 - the plug-in like this normally I
40:46 - wouldn't update like this I would
40:48 - probably probably use FTP
40:52 - and just open the file directly in my
40:54 - editor but this works too so all I've
40:57 - done is just copy and paste of the new
40:59 - stuff I'm going to update it also I mean
41:03 - normally it wouldn't be a great idea to
41:05 - update stuff on a live WordPress
41:07 - installation anyway I'm pretty confident
41:10 - though since we we changed a minor thing
41:13 - that it should be fun and since
41:16 - everything if you mess up something in a
41:20 - plug-in you like very quickly realize
41:21 - that you mess it up in WordPress like
41:23 - you'll get this white I think it's like
41:25 - a white screen or something and you
41:28 - can't log in your site so if that
41:30 - happens you want to go in with FTP or
41:34 - SSH whatever you can and just rename the
41:38 - plug-in folder of the plug-in that you
41:41 - just changed is causing the problem and
41:43 - then that'll let you get back at least
41:45 - into your site and have your site
41:46 - running again and then you can revert to
41:50 - a previous version or whatever you
41:52 - change you can revert it back and try to
41:53 - figure it out best thing to do would be
41:57 - to have a a dev version of WordPress
42:01 - that you can test it out on first which
42:03 - I did not have set up for this yet but I
42:07 - may end up setting it up at some point
42:12 - so let's check out our PDF pages alright
42:19 - so now we have our PDF pages so you can
42:25 - see it's just like a normal wordpress
42:27 - post right just basic stuff we do want
42:30 - to add one field though and for that I'm
42:33 - gonna use a plug and I'm not gonna
42:34 - custom code that so let's get on our
42:37 - custom fields plugin
42:43 - and we're gonna add a new group and
42:49 - we'll call this PDF page info and I'm
42:56 - gonna we're going to make sure that it
42:57 - shows that it only applies when the post
43:01 - type is equal to PDF page I'm gonna add
43:05 - a field the field label is going to be
43:12 - actually I was gonna make it PDF URL but
43:15 - it should probably be an upload so let
43:23 - me see file
43:37 - okay so we will upload that I kind of
43:40 - didn't want to at first because I wasn't
43:43 - sure I wanted to have all the PDFs
43:44 - hosted there on the site but they'll
43:49 - probably be less room for error if the
43:53 - PDF just gets uploaded and I can pull
43:55 - the URL otherwise it's gonna be someone
44:00 - manually copying and pasting or typing
44:03 - out a URL and then two things could
44:06 - happen that I could see either they mess
44:08 - up the URL and it doesn't work or
44:11 - something happens to the place where
44:13 - that PDF is hosted so even if just the
44:17 - change in the file name occurred then
44:19 - the link wouldn't work anymore or that
44:21 - server could be down or something so it
44:23 - probably is better if we just have the
44:28 - PDF there it within the WordPress and
44:33 - it's a droplet on digitalocean I could
44:36 - always upgrade the storage if I need to
44:38 - if things start to get crazy
44:40 - I don't really anticipate that that much
44:43 - will get uploaded that I would need to
44:45 - upgrade stores so this should probably
44:52 - I'm actually not I'm not gonna require
44:56 - this because the way we're gonna display
44:58 - this the way I want to display this is I
45:03 - want these pages to be just
45:04 - informational pages so it's not gonna
45:08 - say right away that these are just PDF
45:11 - conversions the PDFs almost gonna be
45:13 - like an afterthought like if you want
45:15 - the PDF version here it is so in case
45:19 - there's at some point down the road they
45:22 - want to just include some information in
45:24 - this page without actually include
45:26 - having a PDF version I'm gonna make this
45:28 - not required and I want to return the
45:34 - file URL
45:40 - and that should be it
45:45 - now we can let's see I want to put this
45:53 - up high after the title so it's really
45:55 - obvious I do want to put this in the
45:59 - standard meta box I think the seamless
46:01 - kind of looks a bit nicer but it's more
46:05 - familiar for users to put it in the
46:06 - standard box so what what I don't need
46:11 - here so I want to hide the permalink I
46:18 - want to keep the content editor so when
46:21 - we're only using WordPress for the API
46:23 - we can hide a lot of things because they
46:25 - won't really work so we don't need the
46:29 - exurbs we don't need the custom fields
46:33 - because this isn't talking about the
46:34 - custom field we just made this would
46:36 - have been if we if we added custom
46:38 - fields through WordPress has kind of
46:40 - like a built-in way to do custom fields
46:42 - that's not nearly as user-friendly and
46:45 - powerful as this plugin
46:47 - we don't need discussion comments
46:50 - revisions could be helpful the slug is
46:55 - unnecessary authors unnecessary format
47:02 - I'm gonna hide featured image for now I
47:07 - don't think we'll be including images at
47:10 - least a featured image and I'm not gonna
47:15 - worry about categories or tags and
47:17 - another track back so this is going to
47:19 - simplify the UI significantly so you'll
47:22 - see when we go back in there will be a
47:24 - lot less than there was originally so
47:29 - I'm going to publish that and now let's
47:32 - go back in we'll add a new page okay see
47:38 - so here's our file input so we can add a
47:41 - file and actually this PDF I'm just
47:46 - gonna put this PDF in just a little
47:48 - have something and let's add a title
47:54 - test page and let's grab some just some
48:04 - some text to throw in there
48:15 - and I just grabbed some some bacon ipsum
48:22 - which is a taste to your version of
48:24 - lorem ipsum we don't really need the
48:31 - sharing buttons but I didn't see an
48:32 - option to get rid of these so I'm not
48:34 - worried about it now it won't make a
48:35 - difference whether this is checked or
48:37 - not but we can see you know really
48:41 - there's it's really simple for people to
48:43 - edit things in here there's not much
48:45 - that can be done so I'm gonna publish
48:47 - this and that's all we need to do on the
48:54 - wordpress side of things so it should be
49:01 - it should be enough for us just to have
49:03 - this one instance of it we kinda think
49:13 - there's really only one spot where we
49:14 - would display more than one set of data
49:16 - and that's that's one the about page so
49:20 - we may have to just hard code in some
49:23 - some other examples just to see what it
49:25 - will look like but this should be fine
49:28 - for now
49:30 - so that's it for the wordpress side of
49:32 - things and we'll check out the wordpress
49:37 - api now just to make sure that we're
49:40 - getting the data and as soon as you see
49:44 - the data I'm gonna go I'm gonna check
49:46 - back in the live stream because that's
49:47 - kind of the end of part one of our
49:50 - little mini project here so I want to
49:53 - check out the PDF pages oops
49:59 - was a PDF page there we go PDF page so
50:05 - here we go so when we make an API call
50:09 - to get a PDF page this is what we'll get
50:13 - back we actually don't need all of this
50:15 - data so we'll probably filter it down
50:17 - because we'll just need the content and
50:21 - we'll get the URL here we go here's our
50:28 - PDF upload URL so that's pretty much all
50:34 - we need and the title alright so we have
50:41 - that and I can move this over I don't
50:44 - think we need it anymore now I'm gonna
50:51 - go to the live chat quickly next step is
50:53 - going to be editing our about page to
50:58 - give users somewhere to actually click
51:00 - to get to our new page that we're gonna
51:03 - make all right so I'm gonna scroll up a
51:07 - bit in a live chat see what I missed
51:15 - okay Evo just added the github issue
51:18 - thank you so much for that the issue
51:20 - about the appearance of the Select okay
51:26 - Jeremy is bringing up there's a slack
51:29 - channel now for for free code camp
51:38 - it's FCC pair programming slack calm and
51:46 - Joe says FCC just keeps getting better
51:48 - every day
51:49 - awesome I like that that comment
52:00 - okay it looks like Zanna has included
52:05 - some images of that select input as well
52:10 - from Ubuntu on Firefox and Chrome okay
52:15 - so it looks like on Firefox it actually
52:17 - is working I'll put it on the screen
52:21 - quickly so it's working but it's black
52:24 - in the background so this might be a
52:26 - little bit more challenging than I
52:28 - thought because you know the we need it
52:33 - to show up the text to show up is white
52:35 - when it's selected and we can't just
52:39 - simply make it black because it wouldn't
52:42 - show up in Firefox so off to think that
52:44 - one through a bit more to make sure that
52:50 - the text is readable I'm trying to think
52:55 - the last time I did this it was on a
52:58 - white background so I didn't have the
53:00 - same issues I mean as possible I could
53:07 - just change this so that it's not on a
53:09 - black background anymore if I can't find
53:11 - some way to make this work and then that
53:16 - would just solve the issues because we
53:18 - would have a dark-colored font and it
53:20 - should work all the time because this
53:22 - this then would have a white background
53:24 - instead so anyway we'll see actually
53:27 - what do you all think about this black
53:29 - bar anyway so I've gotten some feedback
53:33 - from co-workers and the feedback so far
53:36 - was at first it was a little jarring but
53:39 - it only took you know a minute or so to
53:41 - get used to it and then it was it was
53:43 - okay so not great feedback I mean I
53:48 - would rather have wow this looks amazing
53:51 - so I'm not I'm still not sure about it
53:55 - myself now that I've been looking at it
53:56 - for so long I'm used to it but I just
53:59 - kind of I didn't want to just all white
54:02 - you know I wanted something else here to
54:05 - kind of set these off you know these
54:09 - controls these filters off from the rest
54:12 - of the content
54:13 - so if anyone has any other ideas let me
54:16 - know and I'm definitely open to some
54:22 - alternatives I mean I need to be careful
54:24 - I can't spend too much on it so if it's
54:27 - at a point where it's good enough I'll
54:29 - probably just have to leave it because
54:31 - we're running out of time so I don't I
54:33 - don't really want to mess with it too
54:35 - much but a color change shouldn't be
54:37 - that big of a deal you know if I really
54:41 - find a color that that I like I'm open
54:44 - to spending the time to change it
54:53 - okay yeah and so in regard to the slack
54:56 - Channel yeah I can't so a few people are
55:02 - saying they couldn't get into the slack
55:04 - Channel they need an invitation or
55:05 - something I had the same issue I
55:07 - couldn't get into the slack Channel
55:09 - either let me I think I still have it up
55:13 - on my screen somewhere at least I did
55:17 - I've way too many windows open I'm not
55:20 - sure here it is I find it yeah so this
55:27 - is what I'm getting sign-in to FCC pair
55:30 - programming and when I try to sign-in I
55:33 - can't
55:35 - so it says contact the team
55:37 - administrator and I'm not sure who the
55:39 - team administrator is or what their
55:41 - contact information is so has anybody
55:44 - been able to get in if so how
56:19 - okay his Hannah says all that is a bit
56:22 - unintuitive can you just use categories
56:24 - instead I'm not sure I'm trying to look
56:30 - at the timestamp for that was that in
56:34 - regard to to this bar here
56:54 - you know Evo says I don't really like
56:56 - that people are now using slack as a new
56:58 - generation of email maybe I'm just
57:00 - stubborn or getting old
57:02 - he says I'm twenty but I just can't
57:05 - really get used to it so I'm not sure
57:10 - that that 20 is old I guess if you're a
57:14 - kid 20 years old but yeah i'm i like
57:21 - slack but I'm not sure that slack is a
57:24 - actual email alternative I use slack for
57:27 - different things that I would never
57:29 - normally send an email for so I know
57:32 - there are people saying like slacks
57:34 - gonna kill email like emails that I
57:36 - don't buy that I emails probably gonna
57:38 - be around for a long time because
57:39 - everybody's used to it it works but
57:43 - slack is really cool for what it does
57:45 - and so I like I like that if I want to
57:52 - send a quick message to somebody that
57:54 - would be a waste of time to send in an
57:55 - email slack is really great for that
58:13 - okay so I'm getting some feedback about
58:14 - that section maybe change it from black
58:18 - to the like the red color and then that
58:22 - may that may look better
58:36 - okay Zanna says maybe like just leave it
58:43 - leave it white but add like a border a
58:46 - thin border at the bottom and the top or
58:53 - even like John said to make it make it
58:58 - that red color
59:08 - okay I'll have to try that out
59:29 - oh okay I see what is n I see what
59:32 - you're trying to say here so then let me
59:36 - let me try to explain what I think
59:38 - you're saying you could let me know if I
59:39 - got it right here
59:40 - so instead of having the word all right
59:43 - here which doesn't really say much have
59:46 - it say like categories or something and
59:50 - that would that would make more sense I
59:52 - did originally have it saying choose a
59:54 - category but I got an error so basically
60:00 - I had to like add in manually that the
60:03 - the word selected into that into that
60:07 - element into that option and then react
60:10 - gave me a warning it wasn't really an
60:13 - error message gave me a warning saying
60:14 - not to do that I don't know why I
60:16 - shouldn't do that but I could definitely
60:19 - change that back so that category is the
60:24 - first thing actually that would make
60:28 - sense it would definitely work if I
60:31 - would just say choose a category is the
60:34 - first thing that people say it's not
60:38 - going to be disabled the problem right
60:39 - now is it's disabled and greyed out a
60:40 - little bit I'll just make it have the
60:42 - same value as all and then that way
60:46 - it'll show everything if someone happens
60:51 - to click on it again who cares it'll
60:54 - still show everything or they would just
60:55 - naturally click on all
61:09 - okay yeah I think I'll do that I think I
61:13 - might actually do that right now since
61:14 - it's such a small change it would be
61:16 - better just to do it I mean I have it
61:19 - open already so let me I do want to
61:23 - double check would I put my I lost my
61:31 - terminal I just wanted to check to see
61:33 - if I had anything that was not committed
61:36 - here it is okay so it's clean you know
61:44 - obviously I'm gonna start doing a lot of
61:46 - stuff directly on the dead branch and
61:48 - just kind of merging in all the
61:50 - different branches that I've been
61:51 - working on into dev like as they start
61:54 - to get closer to being done
61:58 - so I'll take out disabled and I'll put
62:04 - in a zero and then that should
62:10 - automatically make it the first option
62:18 - so I say that it didn't Auto refresh
62:21 - there we go so that works better you can
62:30 - click all here what you want to make
62:32 - sure this works if I click choose a
62:33 - category it still works us all okay so
62:36 - that look better
62:48 - okay Patrick says get some Patrick
62:51 - suggested saying all categories
62:53 - Johnson's and categories yeah I think
62:58 - any of that work I probably I'm just
63:00 - gonna keep this just so that I don't
63:03 - spend any more time on it
63:04 - but anyway yeah I'm glad that that you
63:08 - brought that up because okay Patrick
63:11 - likes what I ended up with I'm glad you
63:13 - brought that up because I it was
63:17 - something I had thought of earlier and I
63:20 - thought the same thing that it would be
63:21 - weird and then I just kind of gotten
63:22 - used to it and and just kind of forgot
63:24 - about it and I never like I never wrote
63:28 - it down usually make a little note in
63:30 - Trello when I think something like that
63:32 - but for some reason I didn't and so just
63:35 - kind of forgot so it's really good to
63:39 - have all these people looking at it you
63:41 - know all of you looking at it and you
63:43 - know just in general on a project it's
63:45 - great to have other people look at it
63:46 - because when you're building it you just
63:49 - get used to certain things and take for
63:50 - granted that people are gonna understand
63:52 - it so it's really like I mean doesn't
63:56 - really matter how good you are as a
63:57 - developer I think that's it's just like
63:59 - a natural thing is that you can't look
64:02 - at it with fresh eyes like the user
64:05 - would a new user because you've been
64:08 - looking at it for so long I mean maybe
64:10 - if you waited a year and then looked at
64:12 - it again and you've forgotten it you
64:14 - know that would be the only way but I
64:16 - mean who has time to wait that long okay
64:18 - so that looks a lot better now let me
64:21 - commit that I'd hate to commit make a
64:25 - commit for such a small change but the
64:27 - other changes we're going to be doing
64:28 - you're so unrelated that I'd rather just
64:31 - just do it so so we're gonna commit
64:37 - we're gonna get commit and then we're
64:40 - gonna use the flag am so this will add
64:43 - the file and make the message at the
64:45 - same time so we don't separate it into
64:47 - two steps and let's see
64:54 - this is gonna change default option
65:07 - resource category select okay that works
65:14 - probably what's gonna happen is I'm
65:16 - gonna change that
65:18 - at some point so if I end up using a
65:20 - select somewhere else in the site I'll
65:25 - probably make this option be like a prop
65:31 - that you could pass in the text for this
65:33 - option I think that's the only thing
65:38 - that would have to change everything
65:40 - else could stay the same and it would
65:44 - work
65:45 - possibly like some of the colors could
65:47 - end up being options that get passed in
65:51 - but that would really be it then then it
65:54 - would make this component like fully
65:55 - reusable and as possible am I using
66:09 - okay so I'm not really using any colors
66:11 - here so this could stay and that would
66:13 - oh yeah I am I'm using this color so
66:20 - potentially I could just pull this and
66:23 - include it here so that the color could
66:27 - actually be a prop as well so I'm not
66:31 - gonna do it now but if I do end up using
66:34 - this again I'll pull that in and then it
66:39 - will be reusable all right so we need to
66:46 - bring up the about page cuz that's what
66:51 - we're gonna be working on and let me go
66:59 - back I wanna check the last shot just
67:00 - really quick
67:10 - let's see I'm bare toasters I wish I
67:12 - could open source this HR portal page so
67:15 - is that I'll bear - are you is that what
67:17 - you're working on now and you not
67:19 - allowed to open source it that's things
67:21 - I I I definitely prefer at least now
67:25 - definitely now that I'm doing streaming
67:27 - I prefer to work on things that can be
67:30 - open source
67:37 - Patrick is bringing up the new stuff and
67:42 - NPM five point two point zero is NTX
67:46 - it's a new command that's really useful
67:53 - so you could do like npx create react
67:56 - app new app it'll grab the latest create
68:00 - react app without polluting the global
68:03 - node that's cool yeah I saw some stuff
68:05 - on Twitter about it but I didn't really
68:07 - read into it anymore so people on
68:12 - Twitter seem to think it was really
68:13 - really useful so I have to check that
68:15 - out
68:17 - hey Sebastian's here how's it going
68:21 - yeah Sebastian pretty much all you
68:23 - missed I kind of explained how I fixed
68:27 - the select input from yesterday and I
68:31 - made a custom post type with a custom
68:33 - field in WordPress so we haven't really
68:38 - done too much with react yet and we're
68:40 - about to jump into that right now
68:50 - okay so in Patrick just put a link in to
68:58 - a medium article about npx so if you can
69:02 - get to the live chat and check out the
69:05 - the link then that should tell you a bit
69:11 - more about it
69:12 - I'm not even gonna attempt to read out
69:14 - the link because it's super long all
69:17 - right so we're on the about page the
69:19 - first thing let's just look at it and
69:21 - figure out where we're gonna put this
69:22 - thing so here's our about page now so
69:37 - let's see
69:46 - all right so this will definitely can
69:49 - stay down at the bottom this is the
69:51 - least important section I'm not sure I'm
70:01 - thinking probably we could probably put
70:08 - a new section here and that would make
70:11 - sense just visually it would break up
70:13 - this kind of double whitespace section
70:16 - since most you know we're breaking it up
70:19 - everywhere else so probably another red
70:23 - section something you make maybe another
70:28 - another red section in between here I'll
70:38 - probably give it a title just as more
70:40 - information for now and then if if it
70:45 - needs to change then it can change it's
70:47 - not really a big deal
70:48 - so that section will say more
70:50 - information and then it can have its I
70:57 - mean it's really just gonna have lists
70:59 - of links
71:06 - I don't think there's that many links
71:08 - right now I think it's like at most six
71:10 - or seven but it could potentially be
71:17 - more so would like to think of a way
71:21 - that it won't get too cluttered up if
71:23 - there's more
71:41 - I'll think about it let's just start to
71:43 - throw in some code now and then see how
71:46 - it looks and then think about right now
71:48 - I'm thinking maybe just like two columns
71:50 - of links and there they're gonna be Auto
71:53 - populated from an API call so I'll just
71:59 - have to figure out some way to
72:01 - distribute them between the two rows
72:03 - evenly and then hopefully the list I
72:10 - mean if the list ends up being like a
72:11 - hundred links it's going to be a super
72:13 - long section I'm okay with that I guess
72:15 - because I said I think the collaborator
72:17 - section is probably not really that
72:19 - helpful to users so not really not
72:27 - really a big deal all right so let's go
72:32 - back and unfortunately this is super
72:36 - long because I haven't transferred any
72:38 - of this stuff over to being pulled from
72:39 - the WordPress API so it's it's all just
72:42 - hard-coded in here but what I want to do
72:46 - is grab the red section that we're
72:50 - already using and I'll just copy and
72:55 - paste that down here and then that way
72:58 - we don't have to waste time typing in
73:01 - code that we've already typed in so this
73:04 - is a collaborator section that's the
73:07 - start of it so we want to pop this in
73:09 - right here and so we actually we need to
73:15 - put in
73:19 - this new section here
73:27 - let's see where if you like container
73:34 - put in another row here and we'll call
73:39 - this I don't remember what I originally
73:46 - was going to call this I'm just going to
73:47 - put information there for now we don't
73:50 - want this flourish white because
73:54 - actually I never ended up building yeah
73:57 - I think I don't think this is doing
74:01 - anything right now this was supposed to
74:03 - do something a long time ago and I guess
74:05 - I never removed it that was one of the
74:07 - things that just got pushed to the side
74:09 - as not really necessary to get done
74:12 - before we launched
74:14 - okay so we'll have that and we're gonna
74:19 - want two columns let's get rid of all
74:24 - this we don't need it and s12 is fine
74:29 - but we want to make this m6 and that'll
74:34 - give us our two columns and inside here
74:39 - you have EUL and then Ally
74:49 - and we're gonna have an a Atrus
75:15 - okay I just want to fill this in a bit
75:18 - to give us an idea of what were what
75:23 - it's gonna look like
75:32 - okay so let's see
75:40 - okay not great just look great right now
75:46 - let's see so obviously we want to change
75:54 - it I'll probably make these I think
75:58 - it'll look a lot better if they're both
75:59 - centerline obviously the the color is
76:05 - gonna change to be white you probably do
76:16 - with making the the font size for the
76:19 - links a bit bigger and maybe like some
76:27 - more space between the list items since
76:32 - they're gonna be things that people are
76:33 - going to want to click on I want to make
76:35 - sure there's enough space especially so
76:37 - on mobile people don't accidentally
76:40 - click you know users with big thumbs
76:43 - have trouble hitting target so I think
76:48 - you usually want to have at least 48 -
76:51 - yes so that's only 20 pixels tall the
76:55 - click target for that's only 20 pixels
76:56 - so the Li itself is even only 25 pixels
77:01 - tall so we definitely want to make this
77:03 - bigger increasing the font size will
77:05 - help to but then maybe we'll increase
77:07 - the line height so I want to at least
77:11 - hit like 40 pixels and that should be
77:15 - decent for for people even with with
77:21 - larger thumbs okay
77:24 - so hook like you remember all that so
77:27 - new color
77:28 - Center it increase the font size and
77:31 - then we'll check it out
77:41 - let's see
77:56 - I think I'm just going to give this a
78:00 - class this section of class of PDF links
78:12 - all right and now that we have that PDF
78:16 - links then we can target this down in
78:18 - our style JSX section here
78:39 - and let's go with make I want to make
78:51 - sure I override anything that
78:52 - materializes doing so otherwise I guess
78:55 - I wouldn't normally need to be that
78:56 - specific but I don't want to mess around
78:59 - that should be specific enough there
79:01 - that'll work so we want to deal it a
79:03 - color of white and let's do a font size
79:10 - of let's try 22 and see how that looks
79:20 - we also want we want to Center it so we
79:30 - want to Center that within the columns
79:33 - actually we don't I'm not gonna put that
79:36 - down here because we already have a
79:37 - class for that I think this will work
79:45 - if we do if I put on this row this might
79:51 - work
79:56 - to the line Center
80:05 - it's just Center I think it is so I'm
80:07 - trying to remember with the materialized
80:09 - classes for this I think it's just
80:10 - Center so let's see what that did
80:13 - alright cool what did everything so here
80:15 - we have it here's all our links we did
80:19 - get a little bit bigger here but I think
80:21 - it's still not big enough for a target
80:23 - yeah so it's the only 25 pixels so I
80:27 - don't know that I want to go any bigger
80:29 - with the font size so maybe we'll just
80:32 - add some padding to these links and then
80:36 - maybe a little Morgan we'll see so down
80:44 - here let's give it some padding and
80:49 - let's get let's give it a pixel all
80:52 - around and then between these allies
81:03 - let's give normally I would flip the
81:06 - order of this I don't know that it
81:08 - bothers me but I guess it'll be okay for
81:10 - now let's give it a margin of
81:16 - [Music]
81:21 - let's see
81:25 - let's go I don't want a huge margin so
81:28 - let's go four pixels and then zero on
81:30 - the sides there so this when you only
81:33 - have to the first number it first unit
81:37 - is the top and bottom margin and the
81:39 - second one is the left and right margin
81:44 - don't know what did I do
81:47 - I messed something up let me just try to
81:51 - give it a refresh maybe that's all yeah
81:53 - there we go
81:55 - remember that when something weird
81:57 - happens just refresh before you panic
82:02 - alright so now we have a area that we
82:11 - can click on of what is it like 40 what
82:18 - was that 40 it's actually 41 over a
82:27 - little bit it's actually not exactly how
82:32 - I wanted it so let's mess around in dev
82:35 - tools here for a little bit and see two
82:42 - one so I increase this a bit and we'll
82:48 - see so this is our a tag and these are L
82:51 - eyes and what was happening let me try
82:55 - to exaggerate this so we can really see
82:57 - what's going on so let's make this
83:01 - spacing bigger okay that's actually a
83:08 - bit better there's like some overlap
83:14 - where the click target will seem like it
83:16 - was down here in the spot so that's too
83:18 - much spacing but I might go with like 8
83:21 - pixels
83:34 - let's see weekend I don't know if you
83:36 - can tell that I'll try to zoom in so
83:40 - that what's happening is the click area
83:45 - is kind of bleeding over into the area
83:49 - of the margin so I might get rid of the
83:52 - margins on the lis and just put it
83:55 - directly on the a tags and see how that
83:57 - is because otherwise I don't want there
84:02 - to be I'd rather have there be a slight
84:05 - gap of the the clink targets so let's
84:14 - just pull this and for now just get rid
84:24 - of that
84:30 - okay so I want to see how it's working
84:42 - hmm
84:46 - and that's what I thought would happen
84:49 - there we go so initially what had
84:53 - happened is it wasn't working because of
84:56 - the way it was displayed now it's
84:59 - definitely working
85:08 - I switched to display:block but now
85:15 - that's too much so might not even need a
85:19 - margin Oh actually no I definitely don't
85:26 - want it to display:block because then
85:27 - it's gonna go across so let's take that
85:29 - out and
85:33 - [Music]
85:41 - now that's not gonna change it alright
85:44 - I'm not gonna mess with this anymore it
85:47 - works I just like oh maybe I'll actually
85:50 - test it on a phone just to see maybe I'm
85:53 - worrying over nothing and it would be
85:56 - fine to click I think this is too much
85:59 - space between the lists and the heading
86:02 - here so I'm gonna remove some of that
86:04 - space other than that it looks weird
86:07 - because these titles are really small
86:09 - but the titles are definitely gonna be
86:11 - bigger everything on this project has
86:13 - huge titles so I'm more worried about
86:17 - having not enough space for the titles
86:19 - and then wrapping onto another line okay
86:25 - so we'll just leave this kind of as is
86:28 - and then get rid of this space and then
86:30 - we'll be done with that for now
86:32 - and we'll we'll work on the page and
86:37 - then obviously we're gonna want to pull
86:39 - this in this date in through the API for
86:42 - now lo I want to just get all the pieces
86:46 - working before adding that extra
86:48 - complexity of pulling in the data okay
86:57 - so let me remove remove this margin for
87:01 - now we'll just keep the padding let's
87:09 - actually let me I want to see what's
87:11 - causing this space
87:18 - so it looks like we do have a margarine
87:22 - on the bottom of that div but we also
87:24 - have a margin on the H tag
87:31 - I'll try getting rid of the well we have
87:40 - a margin on the UL so we have quite a
87:43 - few margins going on here if I get rid
87:46 - of the margin on the h2 and on the div
87:49 - that should be enough I'd rather do that
87:52 - then come to mess with the UL
88:10 - all right so I'm going to do some inline
88:13 - Styles now and in react you can you do
88:17 - inline styles as JavaScript objects so
88:19 - the first bracket your in JavaScript and
88:22 - then the second bracket may put you in
88:24 - an object so we're gonna go
88:28 - margin-bottom we're gonna camelcase it
88:30 - and we're gonna say zero and then I'm
88:37 - just gonna copy that and paste it on
88:41 - this h2 as well and let's see and that
88:50 - did not any refresh okay let me restart
88:57 - my server and since I'm restarting it
89:02 - this would be a good time to check in
89:04 - with the live chat
89:23 - okay so John has says how about instead
89:32 - of a new section to break up the white
89:34 - space you just had a thin red bar above
89:36 - collaborators on the about page
89:40 - minimalistic and the page content seems
89:42 - filled up enough okay I mean I I
89:46 - obviously didn't see that before I
89:49 - already did this so I'm gonna keep I
89:55 - probably keep this section the same
89:56 - because I already just made it but I
89:59 - actually kind of liked that idea I'm
90:01 - gonna keep that in mind
90:02 - for if I need to add other sections
90:07 - because I don't like being tied into
90:09 - like always having to break things up in
90:12 - the same way John so we have two John's
90:20 - so the first round I just talked to is
90:22 - John be the next one this is John John
90:24 - Hanson says the API data I'm guessing
90:29 - JSON yes it's JSON is this type of file
90:32 - difficult to gzip from the server the
90:34 - project I built went live but all
90:36 - testing shows JSON only file type not
90:39 - compressed done hmm I don't actually
90:43 - don't have experience with that
90:46 - can you can you gzip JSON files from the
90:51 - server I don't I don't know does anybody
90:54 - have any experience with that
91:03 - all right Zanna thanks for answering the
91:05 - the question about the editor
91:18 - Patrick said Patrick said that says yes
91:23 - he likes this question when it gets this
91:26 - question we are getting dangerously far
91:27 - and we were getting dangerously far into
91:29 - the stream without someone asking which
91:31 - would break the streak of every stream
91:33 - so thanks yes thanks for asking that I
91:37 - honestly don't know if it's been asked
91:39 - every stream I'd have to go back and
91:41 - watch them which I probably won't do
91:43 - because as is the case I think with most
91:46 - people but the sound of my own voice
91:48 - just sounds really weird so I usually
91:50 - don't watch my streams often
91:52 - occasionally I'll watch just to see if I
91:54 - can like improve things sometimes I
91:59 - watch to see if I'm saying filler words
92:01 - a lot like um and things which I do and
92:05 - I try to work on huh but it's been a
92:10 - streak of enough episodes that I think
92:12 - we have an official streak going so
92:14 - we'll just we'll just try to keep it
92:17 - going well we are an hour in already
92:20 - crazy actually even more than an hour
92:25 - and when did I start I started it too
92:27 - huh okay
92:37 - John Henson says is it not 44 pixel
92:42 - height and the width minimum for four
92:44 - button links are the reason for using
92:47 - pixels over em2 your website I'm not
92:51 - really sure why you would want to use
92:53 - eeehm or pixels I'm just used to pixels
92:56 - so I can guess I can usually visualize
92:59 - how many pixels the thing will be on the
93:01 - screen because I'm used to pixels I'm
93:04 - not good at visualizing at all what
93:06 - eeehm would be so that's why I use
93:08 - pixels
93:09 - the only other unit I ever use are vh +
93:13 - VW that's also easy to visualize because
93:17 - it's just a percentage of the screen but
93:21 - I'm sure it's probably whatever you used
93:23 - to would be what you end up using unless
93:27 - there's some other other reason why you
93:30 - would want to use a different unit on
93:39 - jar says using REM or e/m is a good
93:43 - practice so yeah I just I see a lot of
93:48 - people using it I'm just not sure why
93:50 - what the benefit is to using it so if
93:53 - anybody knows I'd be open to to hearing
93:58 - about the benefit to using that I don't
94:01 - really know that I would switch at this
94:04 - point since I'm so used to using text
94:06 - the benefit would have to be really big
94:08 - for me to try to switch right now since
94:10 - I'm I've gotten really good at just
94:14 - being able to visualize things in in
94:17 - pixels so I would need a really good
94:21 - reason to switch from it
94:27 - Oh someone's name in the lab chat is
94:29 - inside the matrix that's awesome a great
94:32 - name I used to be a huge matrix fan like
94:36 - back you know when the first matrix came
94:39 - out
94:50 - oh no way all right so bill says there's
94:58 - an app called like so that you can start
95:02 - when you do a stream that will help
95:03 - analyze use of filler words I'm gonna
95:08 - have to look that up because I listened
95:11 - really early on in one of my first
95:13 - streams I listened through the whole
95:15 - thing and I couldn't stand it
95:18 - I used the word um so often it drove me
95:21 - nuts and then on the next stream I
95:23 - apologized profusely to everyone for
95:26 - making them sit through all of that so I
95:29 - really made an effort afterwards to stop
95:31 - that but I think I'm slipping back into
95:33 - it especially on days like this where
95:35 - I'm pretty tired and I'm mostly focusing
95:37 - on on the code so once I get started and
95:42 - I'm talking about something it's usually
95:45 - better but what I'm trying to code and
95:47 - talk at the same time or read things off
95:49 - of the live chat I do say I'm a lot I
95:52 - guess that's normal but I'd still like
95:57 - to quit doing it if I could
96:02 - jonbi says I was so upset they didn't
96:05 - name the sequel's the matrices so this
96:08 - equals to the matrix I like that one
96:15 - Jeremy says I don't even know this
96:17 - filler words my dude so cool yeah I
96:20 - actually read a study where they said
96:22 - that so some people tried to stop using
96:25 - filler words by talking more slowly and
96:27 - pausing instead of using filler words
96:29 - but they did a study where people were
96:32 - more I wanna say how did it go basically
96:36 - people had a much more negative view of
96:39 - speakers who took long pauses then of
96:41 - speakers who use filler words so if it's
96:43 - a choice between pausing and filler
96:45 - words you're better off using filler
96:47 - words so I guess I guess it could be
96:52 - worse than using filler words
97:00 - all right so let me get back to this so
97:05 - this is for now good enough so that we
97:09 - can click on it and make sure it goes to
97:12 - the right place which is all I really am
97:15 - going for for now so now the next step
97:18 - is going to be let me commit this first
97:23 - and where we got
97:40 - okay
97:42 - it's weird out this keeps doing it every
97:44 - time the hot module reloading happens it
97:46 - doesn't load all the styles that's so
97:49 - weird
97:54 - alright so now let's go back to the code
97:58 - we're gonna have to make a new page and
98:00 - next J s and I want to use one of these
98:03 - pages as a head start so I think these
98:12 - pages are pretty much the same single
98:23 - event single news the news page is
98:30 - probably what I want
98:37 - yeah this page has some extra stuff that
98:40 - I don't want to have to change that so
98:42 - the news page I think is more basic
98:54 - am i pulling in I am pulling in some
98:59 - stuff that I didn't add like the SEO
99:03 - description
99:12 - I don't even think I'm ended up making
99:16 - that text I think we're fine I'll copy
99:19 - this page and we use that to make our
99:25 - new page here so I'm gonna call this PDF
99:39 - page don't yes
99:42 - no actually okay it shouldn't matter
99:51 - what the name of the pages now that I
99:53 - think about it
100:03 - and maybe it will
100:07 - I gotta check out my server file for a
100:10 - second hold on okay so
100:36 - what I want to check is with this goes
100:39 - down so let me check out our events page
100:42 - real quick I just wanted I'm worried
100:45 - about what's gonna show up in the URL so
100:50 - I can't remember how it shows up okay so
100:54 - this does show up is events okay
101:08 - okay I see where I put it so I so I can
101:14 - put whatever I want right there so it
101:15 - doesn't even really matter what's here
101:27 - okay that works let me was I know it's
101:35 - right here
101:37 - PDF I guess I'll hyphenated since I was
101:40 - already hyphenating stuff but now that I
101:42 - think about it it doesn't I don't know
101:44 - that it makes much sense probably should
101:46 - have been camel casing this I think the
101:49 - only reason I hyphenated it was because
101:51 - I'm in the pages folder and normally
101:54 - whatever the titles here and the pages
101:56 - end up being URLs and in URLs you're
102:01 - more likely to see hyphens and not
102:03 - obviously not camel case so PDF pages I
102:09 - should say PDF page give me a single
102:11 - page to PDF page such as okay so now we
102:19 - have our PDF page and I can paste in all
102:23 - of this stuff and let me make sure that
102:33 - I really need this
102:41 - so I don't want posts what I want are
102:45 - PDF what was that PDF page we brought
102:52 - this over didn't we I think I'm maybe I
102:59 - must have moved it over again
103:20 - I couldn't remember I think it's just
103:23 - PDF page is what we put in a the API
103:30 - call so we're gonna filter
103:44 - by our ID which is actually gonna end up
103:48 - being the slug
103:59 - we're not gonna need so this is where I
104:02 - filter out what we actually need
104:03 - I don't need taxonomy x' I need content
104:09 - I don't need the excerpt I'm gonna keep
104:13 - it the ID you know actually I don't know
104:17 - if that I even need the ID I don't need
104:19 - tags or categories we're not gonna have
104:21 - an image any featured media all right so
104:27 - that's all we need this will cut out a
104:29 - lot of the other stuff now I need to
104:34 - make sure that I get rid of those things
104:36 - down here if I was using them so this
104:41 - works we don't want let's see what the
104:57 - information this description tag
105:02 - obviously we're not getting anything
105:04 - from the description tag because we're
105:09 - not pulling that in so I guess I can
105:14 - take it out for now just make things
105:18 - more simple I might put it in later on
105:20 - and I'm gonna pass in
105:39 - you don't need that
105:44 - now we got our error page if we need it
105:50 - that are sticking of we're gonna we're
105:53 - not gonna have an image for now we're
105:58 - not gonna have an image but we might add
106:04 - an image to just have the same image for
106:06 - all the info pages for now I think it'll
106:09 - be fine we'll just put in just kind of
106:14 - like a normal title so let's just do an
106:17 - h1 and do there's something we'll have
106:25 - to set it as will need to use
106:29 - dangerously set enter HTML because it's
106:36 - it's possible that
106:48 - sorry I just stuffed in the middle of
106:51 - the thought so basically it's possible
106:54 - that there could be characters that
106:56 - wouldn't show up properly if we just put
107:01 - this props title rendered inside the tag
107:04 - so that's why we do dangerous asset
107:06 - enter HTML because sometimes there's
107:08 - special characters that don't render
107:09 - properly or if I can just close this
107:16 - we'll try it out we'll see how that
107:22 - looks I might have to put that in its
107:23 - own row to make it show up better but it
107:28 - should work there and drops a 2-0 I
107:34 - guess has to put 0 in here okay we're
107:39 - getting the data I should probably use
107:46 - destructuring to get rid of all this but
107:49 - I'm not I'm not worried about it right
107:50 - now there's not really a lot going on
108:02 - okay that's good for now this will give
108:03 - us enough to see obviously we're gonna
108:05 - have to do something with the URL and
108:08 - have some sort of button to download the
108:12 - PDF but for now this will be enough to
108:15 - be able to see what's going on so now we
108:19 - need to go to the server da JS file and
108:30 - I'm just gonna copy and paste what's
108:32 - already being used here for single news
108:37 - and we'll change it out and say we just
108:44 - call that info I think it should be fine
108:46 - I don't it's easy to change later on if
108:51 - I need to as long as I don't think of
108:55 - too many people of link to it actually
109:02 - I'm a bit worried that they might think
109:04 - info is too informal
109:07 - it's kind of kind of a pretty formal
109:10 - type of thing type of organisation that
109:14 - this site's being made for I don't want
109:18 - to put information because they just
109:19 - make it unnecessarily long so how about
109:21 - I just put I that'll be fun I mean
109:26 - YouTube just has a C and their custom
109:30 - URLs for channels so I think that's fine
109:33 - I could put a P for PDF but like I said
109:39 - up I don't want it to be thought that
109:41 - this page is you know just a transition
109:46 - of a PDF I want the PDF to be thought of
109:48 - as the secondary thing
109:54 - the original plan well that I was told
109:58 - is that it was just going to be a bunch
110:00 - of links to PDFs but that's not really a
110:02 - good thing to do on the web it's it's
110:06 - hard you can't search through that
110:07 - content search engines can't see it at
110:10 - least all the content within so so I
110:14 - argued passionately against that idea
110:16 - and so this is this is what was agreed
110:20 - upon so we need to make this our PDF
110:28 - page per mg okay so this is gonna pass
110:40 - the name so we just need to make sure
110:43 - when we make our links the name the slug
110:50 - for that post is what comes after this
110:57 - in the well after this in the URL so
111:01 - this ID part needs to be the slug when
111:04 - we format our URLs for the about page
111:08 - and then everything should work so I'm
111:11 - gonna save that and I'm gonna make sure
111:15 - that I say this as well since we changed
111:19 - the server I need to restart it and I
111:27 - just need to make sure of the the slug
111:31 - so I don't know where I put my I'm just
111:35 - gonna go over to my wordpress
111:41 - installation here oh here we go I
111:45 - finally found my data here's the data I
111:47 - was looking for before so I just need
111:49 - the slug as his test page and I don't
111:54 - know that I was pulling in the slug no I
111:57 - wasn't I need to make sure well I don't
112:03 - need to pull it in here
112:04 - nevermind I don't know what I was
112:05 - thinking so what I need to do is use
112:11 - test page as our URL that's it so I
112:15 - should be able to go in here now and
112:20 - type in I slash test page
112:30 - and that that happened but what is going
112:33 - on okay I see when I copy this page this
112:39 - news page
112:40 - I hadn't copied over shoot what was it
112:49 - I need the side nav actually that's
112:53 - really weird it shouldn't be like that
112:59 - but it's a within nav that should be
113:04 - taking care of that it should should
113:06 - take care of the global and its side
113:08 - enough so I just want to make sure
113:13 - servers fine that's working fine the PDF
113:16 - page I'm 14
113:27 - looks like I'm I'm not bringing in
113:29 - enough okay so I'm bringing in layout
113:34 - within layout nav should be brought in
113:43 - it's that that's odd am I trying to hit
113:49 - the side now somewhere else no this is
113:52 - low phase you
114:12 - all right so I shouldn't have to do this
114:14 - but I think I'm just gonna do it to see
114:19 - if this gets rid of the problem
114:30 - I mean maybe there's something that's
114:31 - going on because it's a parameterised
114:33 - route that I don't know who knows but if
114:37 - this fixes it and that's all I have to
114:39 - do then I'm happy about that you know it
114:41 - didn't
114:58 - all right so
115:09 - that's really odd
115:16 - so I want to check out and see if this
115:23 - is working I know I want to compare I
115:28 - want to compare this to our our file
115:43 - for single events right because the
115:47 - single events used to be the same as the
115:50 - single news and this actually is working
115:54 - so let's see what's different between
115:57 - these ones I'm gonna get rid of that
116:00 - that I added to the top components okay
116:11 - this is interesting so in the single
116:13 - event I'm not using the layout component
116:30 - so that I mean that's a really big
116:32 - difference Wow for the single event this
116:39 - is this is kind of the old way before he
116:43 - switched over to doing things like this
116:51 - I'd hate to switch back to this just to
116:54 - make it work but if I can't figure out
116:58 - what's going on then maybe I'll have to
117:06 - I'm gonna check the live chat just to
117:10 - see so basically everything is pretty
117:14 - much working like we wanted to we're
117:16 - getting it kind of an error unrelated to
117:20 - what the goal was having to do with the
117:25 - init function for the side nav okay so
117:30 - but at least at this point we've
117:33 - successfully had you know you can see
117:36 - the flash quickly of the content well
117:40 - let me let me restart this dev server so
117:44 - we can see it so you can quickly see the
117:47 - flash of content that comes up and it is
117:51 - the content for the page it says test
117:54 - page it has our lorem ipsum so that's
117:57 - working so I guess it's it's mission
118:01 - accomplished kind of for what we wanted
118:06 - to do now I just need to figure this out
118:08 - so I'm gonna go back in the live chat
118:10 - and see if you all have given me any
118:13 - ideas about the problem or if there's
118:15 - any questions that I can answer now
118:17 - since this is now already two hours in
118:22 - it might be a good time to just you know
118:25 - answer some questions and and finish up
118:27 - since since I've accomplished what I
118:30 - wanted to for this dream and then I'll
118:35 - just fix this before I leave today or
118:39 - tomorrow morning
118:59 - okay so we were having a discussion
119:02 - about fonts the units for fonts of
119:05 - pixels versus a.m. and Zanna says the
119:16 - idea is you you ever want to change your
119:19 - font size you just changed it once and
119:21 - all EMS will just use it how does
119:26 - anybody do you say EMS or do you say Ms
119:30 - I'm not really sure I've ever heard it
119:32 - pronounced so I don't know let me know
119:45 - okay so basically the pixels are won't
119:50 - won't respond so it's just much easier
119:55 - to scale your fonts up or down okay
120:14 - okay cool thanks Zanna sent me a link
120:18 - from CSS tricks so thanks thanks for
120:22 - sending that as more information about
120:25 - the whole font units discussion so
120:31 - anyway that's cool I mean that's pretty
120:33 - legit reason for using it so like I said
120:36 - before not sure that I'll switch right
120:39 - away
120:39 - it might be more of a gradual thing but
120:46 - that's pretty decent decent reason I'll
120:49 - just have to get an idea of like what
120:52 - what pixel size compares to the near the
120:59 - rem-3 M's
121:22 - okay Umberto says at least from what I
121:25 - understand and the the the REM unit is
121:30 - compound the compounded scale of the
121:33 - font so if you have REM styles nested it
121:37 - will keep scaling to the most recently
121:39 - scaled size then Zanna says so pixels at
121:47 - the root REM for components and then EMS
121:52 - for text okay I'll definitely have to
121:56 - learn some more and give this some more
121:58 - thought before I start implementing it
122:00 - but it definitely seems like there's
122:02 - some advantages to it
122:10 - okay Alberto says the dev tips youtube
122:13 - channel has a good explanation so
122:15 - actually I off to watch that I really
122:18 - like the dev stiffs channel so if anyone
122:21 - wants some a good resource for learning
122:24 - like CSS and some more design related
122:27 - stuff check out the dev tips channel I
122:31 - the the guy who does that
122:34 - he doesn't do many videos anymore he got
122:36 - a job at Google and is just really busy
122:39 - so I haven't seen very many videos from
122:42 - him lately but his old videos are still
122:45 - really good and pretty relevant it's not
122:47 - like CSS changes that often and a lot of
122:49 - what he does is mostly CSS so I think
122:53 - they're still useful and he's pretty
122:57 - entertaining too easy to listen to
123:03 - Travis that's his name I'm pretty sure
123:05 - the guy from dev tips is his name is
123:06 - Travis okay Santa says there's this
123:12 - whole debate over the pixels okay so so
123:15 - maybe I've stepped in here into some
123:18 - some turbulent waters here with with
123:21 - this debate so I'll have to I definitely
123:25 - won't have time to study up on this
123:27 - right now because I gotta get this site
123:28 - it done but that'll be on the list I may
123:34 - have time to watch the
123:35 - tips video though because I could do
123:37 - that while I'm doing other things
123:39 - multitask a bit alright we had another
123:46 - question about the code editor Thank You
123:48 - Zanna for answering the question again
124:00 - John Hanson says innerhtml found found
124:03 - that out the hard way there's the
124:05 - special characters yeah so that was back
124:08 - when we were I was referencing using
124:10 - dangerously set innerhtml for stuff so
124:16 - like for the title and for the content
124:19 - here so it sounds like you shouldn't use
124:23 - it and I think I'm pretty sure at some
124:29 - point on a stream or something I had
124:31 - someone who was like a little bit upset
124:35 - that I was using this but my thinking is
124:41 - well number one like what else are you
124:43 - gonna do like this this comes through
124:45 - and there's special characters in it it
124:48 - gives you like the character codes and
124:49 - study actual characters and it's it's
124:51 - unreadable you can't you can't have that
124:55 - also as long as you control what data is
124:58 - coming in here which which I do then
125:01 - there's no reason not to use that you
125:05 - wouldn't just pull in random data from
125:07 - somewhere like you'd never want to pull
125:09 - in data that a user could enter you know
125:15 - just some random user could enter
125:16 - because maybe it would be you could do
125:20 - some malicious type of stuff with
125:22 - JavaScript but in this case you know
125:26 - this is the proper way to do it it just
125:27 - happens to be named this crazy name
125:30 - dangerously set in HTML just to warn
125:33 - people but if you know what you're doing
125:35 - then there's no reason not to use it
125:46 - Philip Philip B don't worry about asking
125:49 - the question about the editor that's
125:50 - it's like I totally don't mind when
125:54 - people ask about the editor it's just
125:56 - kind of like a running joke here because
125:58 - everybody asks about the editor so I've
126:01 - gotten so many questions about it that
126:04 - we started joking that we need to have
126:06 - like a chatbot and this job would would
126:09 - be just to say what what the editor is
126:11 - and like made with theme and plugins and
126:13 - stuff amusing so but don't don't feel
126:16 - bad at all I know I used to think the
126:20 - same when I was kind of beginning and
126:22 - starting out that was what I wanted to
126:24 - know all the time when I saw somebody's
126:26 - YouTube video I was always too kind of
126:29 - too embarrassed and shy to ask in a
126:32 - youtube comment so I always was like
126:34 - searching through the comments hoping to
126:36 - somebody else ask the question and then
126:37 - I'd be able to find out what the editor
126:40 - is so I totally understand the desire to
126:46 - know what's going on with with other
126:48 - people's code editors okay and then
126:54 - someone whose name starts with F and
126:57 - then there's a lot of numbers
126:59 - anyone want to explain exactly what he
127:01 - was working on so I'll try to give a
127:06 - really really fast summary of what I've
127:08 - been doing but I've been streaming for
127:10 - over two hours now so it's gonna be
127:11 - tough to sum it all up but basically I
127:15 - made a custom post type in WordPress
127:17 - with a custom field and then I exposed
127:20 - that data by the WordPress API I then
127:24 - pulled that data into a react website
127:27 - that was also using next jazz I use some
127:32 - custom routing in addition to the
127:34 - routing that's there by default for next
127:36 - G is to do what's called parameterised
127:40 - routing so that I can populate a like a
127:43 - template react jazz template based on
127:46 - the post slug in WordPress and do an API
127:49 - call to get the data from just that slug
127:55 - that way it doesn't matter you
127:59 - how many pieces of data are in there
128:01 - there will always be another page there
128:03 - will always have a nice-looking URL
128:05 - based on the the slug for that
128:08 - particular post so thanks that actually
128:12 - wasn't bad I thought it would take me
128:14 - longer to explain it so I'm not sure how
128:17 - how much since that made just such a
128:20 - quick explanation but that's basically
128:23 - what was done along the way we talked
128:26 - about some other things too but in terms
128:29 - of code that's what we did
128:41 - actually I didn't notice it Philip so
128:44 - Phil you just started coding yesterday
128:46 - so awesome welcome to coding and I'm not
128:51 - sure Philips in I didn't see Philip say
128:55 - say anything else so I hope I hope you
128:59 - didn't leave Philip but if you're still
129:01 - here
129:02 - welcome to coding and that's really cool
129:06 - that you're getting involved so right
129:10 - now we're at a point in the stream where
129:12 - we were kind of at an advanced level but
129:17 - every time I start a new project I'll
129:19 - start out with some basics so there's
129:21 - always going to be some basic things
129:23 - that even someone who's very new could
129:25 - probably benefit from so you know check
129:30 - out some of the videos like the titles
129:32 - of some previous live streams and you
129:35 - know if the title is something that
129:37 - interests you you know check it out
129:38 - there's definitely some beginner level
129:41 - stuff in there and I definitely don't be
129:44 - afraid to ask any questions and the live
129:46 - chat or in the comments of the videos
129:48 - you can even direct message me on
129:50 - Twitter I'd be happy to you know give
129:52 - you some advice if you need it
130:10 - John Hanson said I like how we see
130:12 - Jessie struggle that's how it's done
130:14 - I'm glad you like Amy struggle is that's
130:18 - what a lot of the stream is me
130:20 - struggling is when I'm not on the stream
130:24 - I don't have nearly as many issues but
130:27 - believe it or not I usually get a lot
130:30 - done and don't run into so many problems
130:33 - for some reason especially lately the
130:36 - streams have been really difficult and
130:38 - I've just had these like errors and
130:41 - stuff pop up and things just not working
130:43 - out which is fine it probably makes the
130:45 - stream a bit more entertaining and more
130:47 - interactive because you are trying to
130:49 - help me fix it if I just flew through
130:51 - everything and got it all done really
130:53 - quickly it it I don't think that would
130:56 - be as good for the stream it might be
131:00 - better for my project but not not great
131:03 - for this drain okay so we get some
131:09 - commentary here on the pronunciation so
131:13 - okay so we have e m we have M Janice's
131:18 - M's Sara's heard it at M's hey Sarah I'm
131:25 - not sure that I've seen you in the chat
131:27 - before so welcome Sarah okay so maybe
131:34 - I'll say m's now it seems like the the
131:36 - MS one out in the live chat so the the
131:41 - CSS unit that spelled e/m I will
131:44 - pronounce M from now
131:57 - I'll evil s about the format that the
132:00 - content comes through with a dangerously
132:02 - set innerhtml property so if you have
132:05 - content coming in that has HTML tags and
132:08 - you don't want those HTML tags to be
132:10 - displayed you know literally on the
132:14 - screen then you use dangerously set
132:17 - enter HTML then the HTML gets evaluated
132:21 - like it should by the browser you know
132:23 - so all your tags will work properly so
132:29 - it'll it'll be viewed as actual HTML
132:32 - content instead of just a string
132:47 - it's said that made you say we should we
132:50 - should call it live coding with Jesse
132:52 - and the atom editor and then no more
132:53 - questions we just put some text in the
132:56 - corner Eva says she's pathetic yeah yeah
133:03 - I don't know I don't mind the question I
133:04 - think it's kind of fun I I really I
133:06 - don't think I want to put it anywhere
133:08 - that I'm using atom editor I think it
133:11 - would be more fun to just see how many
133:13 - times people ask the question I'm not
133:17 - annoyed by it yet so if I ever do get
133:21 - annoyed maybe then I can have something
133:24 - in on the screen I already have
133:26 - something in the description for the for
133:28 - the videos it's it's there somewhere if
133:31 - you just have to read the description
133:45 - and Amica so sorry if i'm pronouncing
133:49 - that wrong it's eme ka so let me know if
133:53 - I'm pronouncing it wrong so a Mika says
133:56 - hello hey not sure I'm not sure if I've
134:02 - seen you in the chat before so welcome
134:04 - if this is your first time chatting
134:13 - okay so Amica want to know if the code
134:16 - editor does some sort of live preview or
134:18 - any kind of preview so by default I
134:21 - don't think it it uses it does a preview
134:24 - there's probably some sort of plug-in
134:27 - they could do a preview so right now
134:30 - like I'm running a development server on
134:34 - my computer and it does it like reloads
134:36 - everything which you can't see it right
134:41 - now because I have this error message on
134:42 - the screen so it's not it's not coming
134:46 - from the editor but if you if you really
134:51 - wanted an editor that could give you a
134:53 - live preview just want to think of which
134:57 - one would do that well I know like there
135:01 - are some cloud editors that do that like
135:05 - cloud 9 is a cloud editor that does that
135:08 - should I think desktop I guess like
135:12 - Dreamweaver does that I don't know that
135:15 - I would recommend using Dreamweaver but
135:17 - there may be there's a lot of plugins
135:19 - I'm using Adam and there's a lot of
135:21 - plug-ins for it so maybe able to do that
135:38 - Sabo so SSD a bow or so SE must
135:45 - try to pronounce em I'm gonna say Sabo
135:47 - for now since you're still doing this I
135:49 - left the stream maybe two hours ago yeah
135:52 - I am still doing this
135:54 - sometimes the streams are quite long
136:03 - there's some surprise you just don't
136:05 - post the editor and plugins used to make
136:08 - the video about it in the info I did I
136:11 - do I have the editor I have a I'm pretty
136:15 - sure I have a link to the editor in the
136:16 - info I don't have the plugins the I
136:20 - showed all the plugins yesterday on the
136:24 - stream I keep intending to make a like a
136:27 - recorded video for my own youtube
136:29 - channel where I go through how I have
136:31 - Adams set up and I go through all the
136:34 - plugins and everything I just haven't
136:36 - had time to do it yet
136:46 - okay so the the person with lots of
136:50 - numbers in their name and the live chat
136:52 - asks can you summarize this project for
136:54 - me yeah I'll try to do click summary
136:57 - it's it's a react website that's built
137:02 - using next Jas which is kind of like a
137:04 - scaffolding tool for react that comes
137:06 - built in with routing and server-side
137:08 - rendering so it's a react site that's
137:11 - pulling data from a wordpress site the
137:14 - WordPress site has no like publicly
137:18 - visible face to it it's just being used
137:21 - as a content management system so that
137:23 - users who have no coding skills can put
137:27 - in the data easily and then that data
137:30 - comes into the react site it's displayed
137:33 - it looks nice it runs quickly that's
137:37 - pretty much it
137:38 - I mean there's not really it's pretty
137:40 - straightforward there's some other stuff
137:42 - involved like we're doing load balancing
137:44 - between two different node servers the
137:47 - WordPress installation is on a separate
137:49 - server so there's some some extra stuff
137:51 - that's going on that may be a bit beyond
137:54 - like just a really basic project but
137:56 - that's pretty much it
138:07 - yeah the stream will be available to
138:09 - watch so add a question if the stream is
138:11 - available so it will be available to
138:12 - watch usually within a few minutes after
138:15 - I end the stream you can watch the
138:17 - recording and I just saw that Patrick
138:22 - already answered that so thanks Patrick
138:25 - inside the matrix that says you should
138:28 - make a counter in the corner for how
138:30 - many times it's asked for people asking
138:32 - about the editor that would be really
138:34 - cool
138:52 - okay so so amicus question about editors
138:57 - that have a built-in preview thing so
139:00 - Sabo says brackets has a built-in
139:04 - preview that works with Chrome's a
139:06 - built-in plugin and Sara says Adam has
139:09 - one a plug-in as well so awesome Thanks
139:14 - thanks for that information that's
139:15 - definitely a better answer for Annika
139:18 - then then I had oh and John Hanson says
139:25 - that Adam does have a built-in
139:26 - development preview so that's cool I
139:29 - didn't realize that the Adam theme I'm
139:33 - using is called the SETI theme its SETI
139:38 - the SETI theme inside the matrix says I
139:43 - use the live server plug-in and Adam and
139:46 - Visual Studio code to see live preview
139:48 - okay so that's I guess you can check out
139:51 - that plugin
139:52 - so that's uh that's pretty much all for
139:59 - the live chat really I think I did a
140:03 - good job of keeping up with everything
140:05 - so normally I go back through the live
140:08 - chat and answer questions but since I
140:10 - kind of stopped at several points and
140:13 - answered questions I don't think I need
140:14 - to go back if I did miss your question I
140:17 - I'm sorry about that do you can put it
140:21 - in the comments for this video and I'll
140:23 - answer it later on or you can just
140:25 - direct message me on twitter my the link
140:28 - to my twitter is in the description for
140:32 - the video so i think i'm going to end
140:36 - because the stream has been going on for
140:38 - almost two and a half hours now so it's
140:41 - going to be a very long stream and I'll
140:45 - figure out what's going on with this and
140:47 - I'll let you all know tomorrow what the
140:51 - problem ended up being and that's it so
140:58 - if anybody has actually I got something
141:02 - else in the lab chest
141:03 - see
141:06 - inside the matrix's sorry I couldn't
141:07 - help with the air
141:09 - I'm not learned and react or next yet
141:12 - yeah oh don't worry about it yeah I'm
141:13 - like I'll figure it out and you all
141:19 - helped me so much don't ever worry about
141:21 - not being able to help with a problem
141:23 - because I've gotten so much help and so
141:25 - much great information from you all and
141:28 - in the live chat and and so much
141:30 - encouragement too so you all have been
141:34 - great actually I mentioned at the
141:35 - beginning of the the stream that I had
141:39 - submitted proposals for a talk to a
141:44 - bunch of conferences last night and you
141:47 - can if you check out a tweet I had like
141:51 - last night so it still should be up at
141:53 - the top in my Twitter you can actually
141:54 - there's a link to see what the
141:56 - presentation is but just to save you the
141:58 - trip the the title of the the talk I'm
142:04 - pretty sure I titled it something like
142:05 - how live coding changed my life or
142:08 - something like that so it's really cool
142:10 - and basically it's all because of you
142:13 - it's not it's not actually the act of
142:16 - coding while talking it's it's all of
142:18 - you it's the interaction I've had with
142:20 - you all and how encouraging you've been
142:22 - and hopefully you've been in the
142:23 - community that's been built up so that's
142:26 - really the amazing thing that I think is
142:30 - it's just really it's really unique you
142:35 - know something I've never had before I
142:37 - usually work alone hey see you later
142:41 - Zanna then asked to go so I'm saying she
142:44 - said goodbye in the lab chat Oh see you
142:46 - hopefully tomorrow you can make it for
142:48 - the stream so anyway that's I always
142:52 - kind of never really knew what I would
142:55 - talk about at a conference that I could
142:57 - talk about maybe better than other
142:59 - people but I think this is something
143:01 - because I've experienced this now in
143:03 - this community so so I finally have
143:07 - something that I think it's worth you
143:10 - know I could do a good job and really
143:12 - you know tell people something that's
143:14 - that could be valuable
143:17 - I think I did apply to do a talk about
143:20 - next using next Jas with an API and all
143:23 - kind of stuff and react but I think
143:25 - there's a lot of other people that could
143:26 - give a talk like that too and probably
143:28 - better than me so I'd be happy to give
143:30 - that talk it would be more technical but
143:33 - I suppose it wouldn't be quite as unique
143:37 - as what I could could talk about in
143:40 - terms of the you know the live coding
143:44 - yeah so Jana asked where is the talk at
143:48 - so I don't really know I I apply to some
143:51 - some talks in the United States one in
143:54 - in England and oh no I don't have the
144:00 - talk on my channel yet so I haven't you
144:03 - know fully like thought out everything I
144:06 - would say I definitely have a lot of
144:08 - what I would say you know kind of in my
144:10 - head but if I get accepted to a
144:12 - conference to do it then I probably you
144:15 - know I'll do it all I was thinking I
144:17 - might even do like practice as a
144:19 - livestream you know just kind of
144:21 - practice the talk and get feedback
144:22 - before I actually have to give it at a
144:25 - conference so maybe I'll do that so I
144:27 - don't know I've never spoken at a
144:29 - conference at a tech conference before
144:31 - and so we'll see I might not get
144:34 - accepted at all but I think I'll
144:36 - probably just keep applying you know as
144:38 - I see things come up just keep applying
144:42 - to or submitting talk ideas and maybe
144:45 - I'll get one and maybe we could actually
144:47 - think it would be really cool if I got
144:49 - to go somewhere that was like near where
144:50 - one of one of you lived and then could
144:54 - have like an eat up or something of you
144:57 - know like freak freak out camp people or
145:00 - something that would be kind of fun but
145:04 - I don't know we'll see I think there's a
145:06 - conference in Argentina that I'm going
145:08 - to apply to as well but they want you to
145:10 - do like a three-minute video telling why
145:13 - you should be there so I need to make
145:14 - the video first like what else where
145:19 - else I applied some places in Florida in
145:22 - the United States
145:23 - I think conference in New York
145:27 - Tennessee Washington DC so kind of like
145:35 - all different places but anyway I don't
145:40 - want to I don't want to just kind of go
145:43 - on and on with with talking so I'm gonna
145:46 - wrap this up if anybody has any advice
145:49 - for me in terms of trying to get
145:51 - accepted into conferences that would be
145:54 - really awesome even if you just want to

145:58 - said to try to get in the conference I
146:00 - mean if you if you have any advice you
