00:03 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:05 - with jessie i'm jesse and with me is
00:08 - gemma hi i'm drinking gatorade
00:13 - ambrose
00:14 - in the background and cordelia you know
00:16 - say hi cordelia
00:20 - yeah
00:21 - all right
00:22 - so
00:23 - anyway my kids are all here well not all
00:26 - of them there's another one upstairs i
00:27 - have four but uh today we're gonna
00:30 - continue to work on
00:33 - this uh expo react native uh app
00:37 - uh so right now we're running it as a
00:42 - um
00:44 - as a web app so uh evan bacon's in the
00:47 - channel who uh works at expo and does
00:49 - some awesome stuff with uh expo web we
00:52 - are gonna see some expo web stuff that's
00:54 - let me bring this up on the screen
00:56 - uh
00:58 - let's see where it went
01:01 - live stream
01:04 - there we go
01:05 - my computer went into sleep mode
01:08 - uh and so all my
01:10 - all my screens got rearranged so
01:13 - i had it all set up
01:15 - and then i lost it
01:18 - there we go
01:19 - all right so
01:21 - this is the app
01:23 - running
01:24 - actually it's not it's not really
01:25 - running uh
01:27 - it's just whatever is left over from
01:29 - what we ran last uh last evening
01:33 - what are you holding up amber
01:35 - did you make a sign
01:37 - and i'm holding up hey
01:43 - all right so
01:44 - anyway i'm running uh react native with
01:47 - uh expo
01:50 - and let's see if the chat sums up with
01:52 - my chat if um
01:56 - somebody tried to type something in the
01:58 - chat because i think my chat got
02:00 - disconnected
02:02 - and i'll see if i can see it because
02:04 - right now i am
02:05 - not able to see the messages in the chat
02:09 - i could try to
02:11 - open it in a new window
02:13 - oh okay i opened my chat in a new window
02:16 - and now i can see the messages so
02:18 - hopefully this will work
02:24 - okay yeah so i think
02:26 - i lost some of the first messages so if
02:28 - you ask me something right off the bat
02:30 - then
02:32 - i probably can't see it anymore but i
02:34 - can see the chat now so hey everybody i
02:36 - guess it was really weird there were
02:38 - only like three messages in the chat and
02:40 - that's very uh uncommon
02:43 - um
02:44 - so i def i just lost the first
02:47 - few messages or whatever uh so sorry
02:49 - about that but
02:50 - uh
02:52 - anyway um
02:55 - i am
02:58 - i built this uh like built the app with
03:01 - expo which is a tool that helps you
03:02 - build with react native
03:05 - so
03:06 - i'm using yarn so i just typed in yarn
03:08 - start and now once expo runs and does
03:10 - its thing if i hit w it'll open up
03:13 - the
03:14 - expo app
03:16 - in a web browser uh so
03:19 - you can see here having the web browser
03:21 - i can refresh it's it's running here
03:23 - uh which is pretty sweet and it actually
03:25 - makes it way easier
03:27 - cordial you don't hit that button but
03:29 - you can't sit with me all right go
03:30 - hitting buttons um i'll sit with you
03:34 - so it's it's actually really awesome i
03:36 - kind of prefer working like this unless
03:38 - there's something i really need to test
03:39 - uh on a mobile phone
03:42 - i prefer to do most of the development
03:44 - with the web uh
03:46 - version of uh
03:48 - of expo which is using react native web
03:52 - um
03:53 - it's just so much easier to be able to
03:54 - do all your debugging with um
03:57 - like in a web app right the um
04:01 - the feedback loop is tighter right so
04:04 - it's there's less time uh you know the
04:07 - uh
04:08 - there's a little bit of lag if you're
04:10 - developing like on a mobile device that
04:12 - connected your computer between when you
04:14 - make a change and when it actually
04:16 - updates on the device
04:17 - i find like
04:19 - uh i just have way less issues doing it
04:21 - like this
04:22 - i do have to frequently kind of keep the
04:25 - mobile version open though
04:27 - just to make sure i haven't messed
04:28 - anything up but it definitely helps me
04:30 - develop faster
04:32 - this is i've i've used this
04:34 - professionally and on side projects like
04:36 - i'm doing here so
04:37 - i definitely i like that
04:40 - that aspect of it
04:43 - and
04:44 - let's see
04:46 - trying to get my
04:48 - there we go i want to get my chat all uh
04:50 - situated with the uh stream data
04:53 - on my other screen here okay cool
04:57 - so
04:58 - this is the third stream uh that we've
05:01 - done with this particular app
05:04 - real quick i'm going to go over the goal
05:06 - of this app
05:08 - we are trying to take data from a brain
05:11 - computer interface which i'll i'll put
05:13 - on in just a minute and i'll show you
05:15 - but there's a company called nerosity
05:17 - that makes a brain computer interface
05:19 - that's called the notion
05:21 - it's
05:22 - it reads your brain waves
05:25 - and then it has
05:27 - an interface uh javascript interface
05:30 - that you can use to get that data into
05:33 - your app so that's what we're gonna do
05:35 - and
05:36 - for this particular app for phase one of
05:38 - the app all i want to do is measure my
05:41 - level of focus
05:42 - and then
05:44 - display a warning
05:46 - whenever my focus is dropped too low
05:49 - just to kind of remind me to stay
05:50 - focused what do you put in your mouth
05:52 - cordially
05:53 - what is that it's a great gift card
05:56 - all right and i'm in the background
05:58 - pretending to sing with your microphone
06:01 - [Music]
06:02 - um
06:03 - so
06:04 - um that's the goal now in this
06:07 - particular stream what we want to do
06:11 - is we pretty much did most of the work
06:13 - we needed to persist user data from one
06:15 - session to another
06:17 - and
06:18 - we want to keep basically we want to
06:21 - just uh finish that uh we're almost
06:23 - finished we had kind of a little bug
06:25 - with it at the end so i want to finish
06:27 - that
06:28 - and then uh actually
06:30 - put in our threshold for
06:33 - the um
06:35 - uh
06:36 - the focus so like we're gonna figure out
06:38 - like at what level of focus should we
06:39 - show a warning and what should that
06:41 - warning be
06:42 - uh and it's probably gonna be a
06:44 - different warning on the web as opposed
06:46 - to on uh on mobile
06:50 - hey kids you can't all sit on my lap so
06:52 - why don't you go play
06:54 - uh that's for um
06:58 - oh yeah don't press those buttons it
07:00 - links up to my phone via bluetooth but
07:03 - if you're going to be down here you
07:04 - can't interrupt me okay
07:06 - uh
07:08 - so
07:10 - all right let's see
07:13 - so
07:14 - here's how we're going to do this in the
07:15 - stream i'm going to start a timer a
07:17 - pomodoro timer it's going to go for 25
07:19 - minutes during that time that 25 minutes
07:21 - i'm not really going to look at the chat
07:22 - too much i'm going to try to focus on
07:24 - coding and explaining what i'm coding
07:27 - and
07:28 - then after the timer goes up i'm going
07:30 - to take a break i'm going to go to the
07:31 - chat and i'm going to answer all your
07:32 - questions
07:33 - uh i want to try to keep this stream to
07:35 - just about an hour long uh and because i
07:38 - want to try to get the kids to bed
07:41 - help get the kids to bed so can i say
07:43 - something you want to say something
07:45 - gemma would like to say so try not to
07:46 - get the corona virus yeah that's very
07:49 - good yeah gemma gemma doesn't want
07:51 - anyone to get the coronavirus so be safe
07:55 - all right all right
07:56 - you want to say something too yeah all
07:58 - right everybody gets to say one thing
07:59 - and then you gotta let me code all right
08:01 - everybody play don't die
08:04 - or else
08:07 - don't die or else don't die all right
08:10 - gemma says don't get the coronavirus
08:12 - ambrose says don't die cordelia would
08:14 - you like to say anything i think that's
08:16 - just bro
08:19 - i can do tools all by myself oh she can
08:23 - do twirls all by herself
08:25 - all right cool
08:27 - all right now you all had your chance to
08:29 - say something now you got to be quiet
08:30 - let me do the coding okay all the people
08:33 - all the people want to see the coding
08:35 - part okay
08:41 - when you get older you can have a
08:42 - youtube channel too all right
08:47 - all right and actually so gemma has been
08:49 - working on free code camp lessons to
08:51 - learn how to code and uh ambrose has
08:54 - been working on coding too
08:57 - and i've been working on um kindergarten
09:01 - math kindergarten math yeah he's working
09:04 - i told him he had to learn how to read
09:05 - and he had to learn his math um
09:09 - all right
09:10 - so see you later thanks for being on the
09:13 - show
09:14 - i'll see you in about i'll see you in
09:15 - about an hour be good
09:20 - okay
09:23 - all right so
09:29 - anyway uh
09:30 - i hope i hope you're all right with that
09:32 - that's how it is when you uh
09:35 - um
09:37 - you work with kids
09:38 - i don't really have an office i'm just
09:40 - in my basement so
09:41 - the kids can just come down whenever
09:45 - uh
09:46 - so let's get started i'm gonna start my
09:48 - timer
09:51 - [Music]
09:56 - make sure it's actually working on
09:58 - yesterday's show i started a timer and
10:00 - then
10:00 - somehow i stopped it
10:02 - and um
10:05 - uh
10:06 - so it looks like it's running
10:07 - successfully this time
10:12 - all right cool
10:15 - let me make this bigger
10:17 - i'll make sure everybody can see
10:19 - all right i'm going to make this
10:21 - as small as i can i'm going to get rid
10:23 - of these files on the side
10:25 - i did put this on github
10:27 - so if you check the description for this
10:30 - video there's a link to the github repo
10:32 - so you can see all this code and um
10:36 - i guess
10:37 - it's not going to be that useful to you
10:39 - unless you have an ocean headset
10:41 - but you can at least check out see what
10:43 - we're doing
10:46 - get a kind of a closer look at the code
10:51 - but what we want to do is
10:55 - the next step i guess we want to do is
10:57 - like the user can put in their id email
10:59 - and password and that links them up to
11:01 - the brain computer interface and it gets
11:03 - us data but as soon as we refresh the
11:06 - page
11:07 - they lose their
11:11 - their subscription
11:12 - to the device
11:14 - as soon as you put the id in we can get
11:16 - it again but what i want to do is save
11:18 - the id in local storage
11:21 - so that they don't even have to put the
11:22 - id in again it'll just check local
11:24 - storage okay so we already have the code
11:26 - for that in here so we have this um
11:29 - this get item
11:31 - for and we're going to get the device id
11:34 - right but the problem is
11:37 - um
11:38 - the part where we actually save
11:40 - is not working right now
11:43 - so
11:44 - we want to
11:46 - [Music]
11:48 - figure out where we can make this save
11:51 - so the reason it's not working is i i
11:53 - think
11:57 - i think that this function is actually
11:59 - running first
12:01 - and we're going to test that let's test
12:03 - that because i don't think we really
12:08 - have i'm just gonna do a console log
12:11 - here
12:12 - and just console.log some
12:14 - some nonsense just to see if that is in
12:17 - fact what's happening
12:21 - and let's make
12:23 - let's inspect
12:25 - we'll bring up the console
12:29 - and uh
12:30 - i want to see if that's really the issue
12:33 - that's happening here because i'm not
12:34 - convinced that it is
12:36 - and let me get my data
12:40 - um
12:41 - yep this is it
12:50 - uh let me turn my device on
12:53 - so this is the
12:56 - neurocity notion headset if you want to
12:59 - know more about this headset and how it
13:00 - works uh you can go to um
13:03 - you can check out a video i did on my
13:05 - youtube channel
13:07 - the link to my youtube channel is in the
13:09 - description below i talk a lot more
13:10 - about
13:11 - what this headset can do
13:13 - and give you a like a demo
13:16 - so
13:18 - all right that's going to start up it's
13:20 - just going to take a few seconds to
13:21 - start
13:23 - and then
13:25 - we should be able to connect in the
13:26 - meantime let me type in our data
13:30 - [Music]
13:34 - okay so this is actually
13:36 - running every time something changes
13:38 - which is what i thought it was that was
13:40 - happening
13:41 - uh so
13:43 - what's gonna happen now
13:44 - is if i put a password in this is gonna
13:47 - run and i believe it's gonna try to log
13:50 - us in
13:51 - uh so
13:53 - what i'm gonna do is
13:55 - let's just remove password from here so
13:58 - this doesn't run when a password is
14:00 - entered
14:03 - it's going to erase my stuff but
14:05 - i'll just copy it again
14:07 - and let's verify
14:08 - yeah see so password is not running here
14:11 - so
14:11 - this is going to test my theory to see
14:13 - if it was actually this function
14:16 - that was logging us in
14:18 - uh
14:19 - early it was basically we're getting
14:21 - logged in too early like before we press
14:23 - the the button to log in
14:25 - which i should probably change that to
14:26 - log in instead of press me but
14:28 - remember to do that in a minute
14:31 - [Music]
14:35 - okay so
14:37 - grab the password
14:43 - all right sweet so it was this function
14:45 - that was automatically logging us in
14:47 - uh so just by removing password i think
14:49 - we've solved that issue
14:51 - and now when i hit this
14:54 - this button should call this init
14:58 - function
14:59 - which should first save our device id to
15:03 - async storage so let's let's go to our
15:07 - application
15:08 - and go to local storage and see right
15:10 - now we don't have the device id saved
15:13 - when i hit this button the device id
15:14 - should be saved and we should get logged
15:16 - in
15:17 - which yep all right so the notions
15:20 - online i just wanted to double check
15:22 - so
15:23 - sweet so we have our device id and now
15:28 - uh let me make this bigger so i could
15:30 - see
15:31 - all right so we can see we have our
15:33 - device id now saved
15:36 - um and we are connected so we're just
15:38 - we're getting some random data since
15:40 - this isn't actually on my my head so
15:42 - we're not getting real data uh yet
15:48 - but
15:49 - sweet so
15:51 - i think that's going to be an easy fix
15:54 - then
15:55 - so we have the data so what should
15:57 - happen now
15:59 - is if i
16:00 - log out
16:03 - no that's not if i
16:05 - refresh the page
16:07 - what should happen
16:08 - is that
16:11 - it should check
16:14 - as soon as this this component which is
16:16 - our app component mounts it should check
16:18 - to see if we have device id and async
16:21 - storage and if it does it'll set the
16:23 - device id
16:24 - when the device id gets set it should
16:27 - trigger
16:28 - this function
16:30 - right which should
16:31 - set in motion
16:33 - everything we need to stay logged in so
16:36 - let's see if that is really the case
16:38 - let's refresh
16:40 - hey all right cool so we saw like
16:42 - briefly a little flash of the uh the
16:45 - login panel
16:47 - until everything actually ran uh which
16:50 - is fine
16:51 - and now we're still focused so awesome
16:54 - so that was actually like uh
16:57 - that was really easy um
17:00 - i ended the stream without having fixed
17:02 - that and it was literally what like a
17:04 - five minute fix so
17:06 - that's really cool
17:08 - so since we we kind of fixed that issue
17:10 - i'm going to go ahead and commit this
17:12 - before we move on
17:14 - the next step is going to be
17:17 - figuring out how to display a
17:19 - notification
17:22 - uh i'm just always used to doing a git
17:24 - status just to make sure of what's
17:26 - changed
17:27 - even though we really only are editing
17:29 - one file here
17:30 - so um
17:32 - let's do git
17:34 - commit
17:36 - and i'm gonna do an am flag that means
17:38 - it's gonna add so it's a git ad plus a
17:41 - commit with a message and so whatever i
17:44 - put in this message um
17:47 - is will be our commit message so i'm
17:49 - gonna say
17:50 - uh feed for feature
17:52 - and
17:55 - we're gonna say
17:56 - um
17:57 - let's see login
18:02 - login persist
18:09 - through page refresh
18:11 - okay
18:12 - cool so
18:13 - that's the new feature that we've added
18:16 - and
18:18 - i'm going to do a git push
18:21 - since it's pretty much just me working
18:22 - on this project right now i'm just
18:24 - pushing straight to master it's still a
18:26 - test project
18:27 - if this was really in production and
18:29 - there were more people working on it i
18:30 - would probably set up different branches
18:33 - and then do a pull request but
18:36 - i think that's a little bit of overkill
18:40 - for
18:41 - uh a side project right now
18:43 - all right so now that we have that set
18:45 - up
18:46 - not only did we really want that set up
18:48 - uh but also it's gonna help us develop
18:50 - this a lot more quickly because we won't
18:53 - have to keep logging in
18:56 - which is a little bit of a pain in the
18:57 - last two streams
19:00 - so now
19:02 - we need to
19:04 - i guess
19:05 - we need to keep track of our our focus
19:08 - the number of our focus so let's see how
19:10 - we're doing that right now
19:12 - uh yeah so we have our focus here in our
19:15 - uh on our state so
19:17 - since
19:19 - every time our focus changes
19:21 - it changes state
19:23 - we're going to be able to pretty much
19:25 - track that right and we can come down
19:27 - here
19:30 - and say
19:32 - [Music]
19:34 - within this
19:36 - [Music]
19:44 - uh let's let's go to our styles should
19:47 - we do styles yeah
19:51 - yeah i think that would be a good way to
19:52 - do it
19:56 - um
19:58 - [Music]
20:00 - right now our background color
20:02 - let me do this i'm going to move my
20:04 - styles
20:05 - into
20:06 - my function
20:09 - because that's gonna allow me to have
20:11 - access to the state
20:13 - right
20:16 - and then now for background color
20:19 - we can make it determine
20:22 - based on on the focus level so let's say
20:24 - focus
20:27 - if focus is
20:30 - less than
20:32 - and uh let's say less than
20:36 - i don't know 0.3
20:40 - then
20:41 - we want the background color to be
20:45 - let's just say red
20:47 - for now so
20:48 - that'll be easy to see otherwise
20:51 - we want the background color to be white
20:54 - [Music]
20:57 - let's see if that works
20:59 - there we go
21:02 - as you can see every time the focus
21:04 - falls below
21:06 - 0.3
21:09 - it's red
21:11 - [Music]
21:15 - and then we go above it
21:17 - it's it's white now like i said right
21:19 - now i don't even have the headset on so
21:21 - it's just kind of giving us like just
21:23 - random numbers because there's not real
21:25 - data coming in uh i could try to put
21:27 - this on so we could get some real data
21:31 - i don't know how well i'm going to be
21:32 - able to focus while i'm
21:34 - kind of working on uh whoops
21:40 - well i'm doing the stream and everything
21:43 - but i'm gonna try
21:44 - try my best to make sure
21:47 - [Music]
22:18 - okay
22:19 - um i might have to drop the focus level
22:21 - if i ever want to get out of the red
22:23 - here
22:25 - um let's drop it down to a point two
22:30 - and then that way we'll get there we go
22:35 - so um
22:37 - right now this is like a decent
22:39 - indicator
22:40 - what i would really like though is uh
22:42 - maybe something a little bit this
22:46 - uh
22:51 - oops it doesn't like that i was using
22:55 - styles before i declared it so let's
22:58 - let's put this up here a little bit
23:05 - i don't think i'm actually even using
23:07 - using this uh
23:10 - loading
23:16 - this is maybe
23:18 - left over from
23:23 - yeah i think that's left over
23:25 - [Music]
23:30 - from the kind of boilerplate stuff i
23:32 - brought in at first
23:33 - [Music]
23:37 - all right so
23:40 - sweet
23:41 - now
23:42 - what i'd like to do is have uh
23:45 - i guess some type of
23:47 - [Music]
23:49 - notification
23:52 - pop up and maybe have it like vibrate
23:55 - uh really
23:57 - ultimately it would be nice if the user
23:59 - could pick
24:00 - their choice of how to be alerted like
24:02 - what type of alarm they would want
24:04 - uh but you know for now this at least
24:07 - gives us some indication of our our
24:09 - focus level that's that's very bright
24:11 - and obvious but we would have to kind of
24:14 - be looking at our phone
24:16 - so it's not not really ideal right if
24:18 - you're trying to focus on something
24:20 - then you don't really want to be looking
24:21 - at your phone right so we need some sort
24:24 - of notification that is going to get
24:25 - your attention
24:26 - even if you're focused on something else
24:30 - so i think some type of audible uh or
24:32 - like vibration would be best now we
24:35 - can't really do a vibration on
24:38 - um
24:39 - you know on our
24:42 - web version of this
24:44 - but we can at least put in some of the
24:45 - code for it and then test it out
24:48 - right
24:50 - okay
24:52 - so
24:53 - let's go into
24:56 - either we're going to look either in the
24:58 - expo documentation or react native
25:01 - so first i'm going to look at react
25:02 - native and see if we have something for
25:05 - vibrate
25:07 - vibration cool
25:10 - so we do have an api for
25:12 - vibration sweet vibration dot vibrate
25:36 - so
25:48 - all right cool
25:49 - um
25:51 - you can see that we can also check and
25:52 - see what expo has
25:55 - i think it's
25:56 - expo.io yeah here's i have the docs in
25:59 - here
26:04 - vibration
26:06 - i just want to see if expo has anything
26:08 - different
26:09 - but it looks like they have the same
26:11 - the same docks here so
26:13 - that's good occasionally expo will have
26:15 - uh like some extra things
26:18 - uh extra extra components that make it a
26:21 - little bit easier
26:22 - to work with these device things but
26:25 - uh for now
26:26 - uh this is gonna work so let's just see
26:28 - if we can set it up
26:30 - so that
26:31 - we have this you know vibration happen
26:35 - based on a state change
26:38 - so first let's pull in vibration
26:44 - from react native
26:53 - and it looks like we need to add
26:54 - something to our android manifest dot
26:57 - xml
26:59 - so let's do that
27:01 - let's add this in
27:03 - and this looks like a permission thing
27:05 - so uh
27:06 - looks like we need to get permission
27:09 - to
27:09 - [Music]
27:11 - um
27:12 - to use the vibrate feature i need to see
27:15 - if we even have
27:17 - i don't know that we even have this
27:19 - because we haven't attempted to run this
27:22 - yeah we've only done the web so we may
27:24 - have to attempt to run this first
27:27 - so let's see
27:30 - i believe
27:31 - we can try to do an android build if we
27:33 - just type a
27:35 - yep there we go
27:37 - let's see what we have it may not work i
27:39 - don't have android studio installed so i
27:41 - may have to get that installed and then
27:42 - try it on a different stream
27:44 - android air
27:46 - no android device found
27:49 - oh okay i can
27:53 - i need to connect my android device
27:56 - which i can do
28:00 - unless i left my cord
28:04 - did i leave my cord
28:07 - i left my cord in my bag that's in the
28:10 - closet upstairs so
28:19 - it's cool i'm going to drop into
28:21 - my amazon alexa device that's upstairs
28:24 - in my house and have one of my kids
28:27 - bring me my bag
28:29 - and then we can connect my device up
28:31 - uh to the computer
28:34 - so
28:36 - let's do a drop-in
28:39 - this is probably the most useful thing
28:41 - on on amazon
28:44 - so it's
28:47 - hello
28:52 - hello can you hear me
28:58 - hey is anybody up there
29:03 - hey i need i need a favor
29:09 - can somebody go in the closet and get my
29:11 - backpack and bring it down to me please
29:18 - hello
29:20 - hi daddy hey there can can you go in my
29:23 - uh backpack and
29:25 - get or my closet and get my backpack and
29:27 - bring it down to me please
29:30 - all right thank you
29:35 - [Music]
29:37 - all right cool
29:39 - so
29:41 - when i get my cord to hook up my android
29:43 - phone i should be able to run this on my
29:45 - android phone and um we should be able
29:47 - to test out the vibration uh on my phone
29:50 - uh which would be pretty cool
29:52 - i'll just like hold it up to the camera
29:54 - i guess so you could see it running
29:55 - which is not ideal but um i don't know
29:58 - that we can test the vibration
30:00 - with the simulator
30:02 - i i said to come down with my backpack
30:04 - you came down empty-handed
30:07 - oh you just came to get my my drone all
30:09 - right
30:11 - all right
30:12 - i'm looking in your backpack for what
30:14 - you have
30:15 - if you have gum i would have it i don't
30:17 - have any gum in here i don't think i do
30:20 - okay
30:22 - i just need the score actually i do have
30:24 - gum here here's your reward you can have
30:25 - my pack of gum
30:29 - i shut the door on your way up please
30:32 - thanks
30:39 - okay
30:40 - so i've got the cord
30:42 - and
30:44 - i made sure i brought this i normally
30:46 - use this when i'm at work but i made
30:48 - sure to bring it home because i
30:51 - i figured i might need it
30:54 - this is like the longest um
30:56 - normal usb to usb c cord that i have
31:00 - i need to find a port for it
31:02 - i don't know if it's like this for you
31:03 - all but like all my usb ports are always
31:06 - taken up
31:41 - i didn't realize this but i actually
31:42 - have a usbc port
31:44 - on that computer that's awesome
31:48 - i can uh connect it just through usbc
31:52 - so
31:53 - that's pretty sweet
31:56 - so now i am connected
31:58 - and
31:59 - let's try this again
32:02 - i'm gonna run this
32:04 - yeah
32:05 - sweet
32:08 - we're running the application on the
32:11 - pixel xl
32:12 - and this should be
32:15 - i might have to scan this barcode
32:17 - if i can find it
32:21 - let's go over here see if i can find it
32:23 - here
32:24 - so
32:26 - if i scan this barcode
32:30 - i should be able to
32:32 - oops
32:33 - to run this on the phone
32:36 - i need to find my expo app
32:42 - and scan this qr code
32:51 - it's still it's running the last
32:53 - application that i built on here not the
32:54 - new one so need to see
32:56 - what is
32:58 - why is it doing this
33:05 - all right usually if you shake the phone
33:08 - you can come up with a screen like a
33:10 - screen will come up but it's not working
33:13 - there we go ah no that didn't work
33:26 - hmm
33:28 - all right let me see
33:30 - this is really weird
33:34 - i don't know if i could do anything from
33:35 - here
33:41 - so like just you can see it is uh it's
33:43 - gonna be really hard for you to see but
33:45 - it's running in application right now
33:47 - but this is the last application that i
33:49 - worked on in expo so
33:52 - it's definitely not what i
33:54 - what i want
33:55 - um
33:57 - let's see
33:58 - how
34:01 - all right i'm gonna check my timer
34:04 - because i may be out of time
34:06 - for
34:08 - yeah okay so it's almost time for me to
34:10 - stop and get to the questions
34:12 - uh but then also
34:16 - i need to
34:17 - know uh
34:23 - enable rivalry the
34:25 - area
34:32 - get the developer menu
34:38 - so i might i can just hit command m
34:45 - or do adb shell input key event in my
34:48 - terminal window
34:50 - shake device vertically a bit
34:58 - yeah my shaking of my device is just not
35:02 - working i could try to reload
35:06 - yeah reloading is still coming up with
35:08 - the old one
35:10 - all right it says i can run this
35:14 - i've never tried this one before
35:27 - um
35:28 - i don't know where let's see if i run it
35:30 - here
35:32 - nope
35:35 - hmm
35:56 - hmm
35:58 - oh yeah so an android device
36:03 - can run it here but it's not
36:15 - i might actually need to get the
36:18 - android emulator going if this if i
36:20 - can't get it to work
36:27 - all right
36:28 - i'm gonna take a little break though
36:30 - anyway uh and answer some questions so
36:33 - maybe i'll uh
36:37 - i'll figure some way out
36:38 - my subconscious will work on this
36:40 - problem
36:41 - while i'm uh
36:44 - while i'm reading questions so i'm
36:45 - scrolling up as far as i can remember i
36:47 - i missed a few um
36:51 - a few questions that got cut off from
36:52 - the chat at the beginning so apologies
36:54 - if i missed your question
36:57 - but let's see so nds this brain computer
37:00 - app what is its function
37:01 - the function of this particular app is
37:04 - to
37:06 - give me an alert give the user an alert
37:08 - whenever their level of focus has
37:10 - dropped below a certain threshold
37:14 - um
37:15 - uh null stock says what technology is he
37:17 - using for the actual brain computer
37:18 - interface uh it is this device that i'm
37:22 - wearing it is called the notion headset
37:25 - by nerosity uh it's a
37:28 - a brain computer so inside here there
37:31 - there is actually a small computer very
37:32 - similar similar to what you would have
37:34 - in your cell phone
37:37 - it's an internet of things device
37:39 - um and
37:41 - it's uh
37:43 - really like very lightweight and just
37:45 - fits fits right on your head it's
37:46 - adjustable so it can fit you know
37:48 - variety of different head sizes so
37:50 - that's the device i'm using uh if you
37:52 - want to know more about that check out
37:54 - my youtube channel links in the
37:55 - description i do a demo video where i
37:58 - talk a lot more about the the device in
38:00 - particular
38:01 - you also if you do a search for
38:03 - neurocity um
38:06 - i'm trying to think what the what the
38:07 - website is i got the website up it's
38:10 - it's
38:11 - neurocity.co um n-e-u-r-o-s-i-t-y
38:16 - dot c-o
38:17 - uh and
38:19 - you can sign up to i believe right now
38:21 - you can pre-order the headset but check
38:23 - check out the site you'll be able to see
38:24 - how
38:25 - how you can maybe get the uh
38:28 - the brain computer interface
38:33 - uh er errored uh sorry for
38:35 - mispronouncing your name says uh you are
38:38 - my favorite uh i believe it's just
38:39 - trying to say channel uh thank you
38:42 - i appreciate that and i assume you mean
38:44 - free code camp's channel which has a lot
38:46 - more than just me on it and so it's not
38:48 - like i'm just your favorite but
38:50 - i appreciate it uh free code camp does a
38:52 - lot of good good stuff
38:55 - um
39:00 - let's see
39:01 - see a lot of you just saying hi so hey
39:03 - everybody
39:13 - let's see
39:18 - uh yusuf says the best channel with best
39:21 - lecturer oh thank you i appreciate that
39:24 - uh
39:26 - we got greetings from all over the world
39:27 - here looks like someone's saying hi from
39:29 - ghana someone from panama
39:31 - um awesome
39:35 - leonard asks where do you live do your
39:37 - kids also have school uh so i actually
39:39 - live in ohio but i'm very close to
39:41 - pittsburgh pennsylvania and that's where
39:42 - i work i'm right on the border
39:45 - um and my kids they don't have school so
39:47 - they never have school on a sunday like
39:49 - a saturday or sunday but they actually
39:51 - have school off because of the
39:53 - coronavirus school has been canceled in
39:56 - uh in the whole state of ohio
39:58 - for the next three weeks so i've
40:00 - actually shut down quite a few things so
40:02 - there's no there's a limit on
40:04 - i think like any gatherings above 100
40:06 - people
40:07 - are now
40:08 - banned uh they they
40:10 - i think they just said they're gonna
40:12 - shut down all restaurants and bars
40:14 - although they're allowing like
40:16 - drive-throughs and um delivery and like
40:18 - take out food
40:20 - uh so there's a lot of restrictions now
40:22 - in ohio which is probably for the best
40:25 - right uh
40:28 - from what i understand
40:29 - you know if we can uh try to
40:33 - do as much as we can as early as we can
40:36 - to stop the virus then you know more
40:38 - people will be healthy
40:41 - um
40:42 - but yeah we'll be uh
40:44 - we'll all be here together in the house
40:46 - for for a long time
40:50 - let's see
40:52 - uh sergey says are they your web team
40:54 - yeah not yet but i'm training them
40:57 - one day
40:58 - i'm gonna train them up i have a whole
40:59 - team of uh of programmers
41:06 - um
41:08 - that valdarg says this seems like
41:09 - something that might be useful for not
41:11 - quite self-driving cars considering the
41:13 - only deaths so far been from people
41:15 - thinking the car was fully self-driving
41:17 - yeah actually what i'd like to do with
41:19 - this is run it as an android auto app so
41:21 - that could remind the driver
41:23 - to stay focused and so whenever the
41:26 - driver loses focus it would give them
41:28 - some sort of
41:30 - notification that wouldn't be too
41:32 - distracting but would remind them to
41:34 - like focus on driving so that's going to
41:36 - be like one of the next steps
41:38 - after we get the basics of this app
41:40 - working is i really want to try to use
41:42 - it with um with android auto
41:45 - and i'm i'm
41:47 - because i have an android phone i can
41:48 - test it out with android auto but you
41:50 - know ideally i know um
41:53 - you know there are other so like apple i
41:56 - think has their version uh i've never
41:58 - used it but
42:00 - i think it could potentially help
42:03 - prevent accidents uh in
42:05 - in cars if if i can get it to work
42:08 - [Music]
42:10 - let's see
42:21 - leonard says here in germany we have
42:23 - three weeks free of school due to
42:24 - coronavirus
42:26 - uh plus two weeks easter holiday so five
42:28 - weeks no school okay so there's a
42:32 - yeah i imagine there's probably uh quite
42:34 - a few uh people out there that are in a
42:36 - similar situation where school has been
42:38 - cancelled or uh
42:40 - you know you're working from home or
42:43 - you know some something like that i i
42:46 - hear um
42:47 - that italy is pretty much on lockdown
42:51 - i don't know if anybody's from italy
42:53 - watching the stream uh you know let us
42:54 - know how it is at least
42:57 - from what i can get here it's just you
42:59 - know online uh so i prefer to try to get
43:01 - information from people who are actually
43:03 - there as opposed to like the news
43:05 - um
43:06 - i feel like it's kind of more
43:08 - authentic information and not filtered
43:10 - through
43:11 - you know whatever news uh source but
43:14 - um
43:16 - anyway i'm gonna go my timer went up
43:19 - for uh for the chat so i'm gonna go back
43:21 - do a little bit of code and then i'll
43:22 - come back to the chat
43:24 - uh in a little bit and um
43:27 - uh see what's uh
43:31 - see what's going on in the chat answer
43:32 - some questions looks like
43:34 - he's from china somebody in here said
43:35 - that hello from china
43:38 - hey how's it going um
43:40 - so we were just talking about the
43:41 - coronavirus with being from china like
43:43 - how is it there uh in terms of like
43:47 - you know are you uh
43:49 - is it at this point do you feel like
43:51 - it's pretty contained uh or is there
43:54 - still a lot
43:56 - um
43:56 - i guess that you can't do it it's it's
43:58 - starting it feels kind of like odd over
44:01 - here um
44:03 - at this point i think it'll get worse
44:05 - than it is now in the united states uh
44:08 - in china do you feel like it's going to
44:09 - get worse or does it seem like it's
44:11 - getting better
44:13 - anyway oh wait i i may not see your
44:15 - message for a while because i'm going to
44:16 - go back to the chat but i just
44:18 - uh kind of would would love to get like
44:21 - a first-hand account of kind of what
44:24 - feeling you get about it i realize china
44:26 - is a very big country so different areas
44:28 - of china are going to have have
44:30 - different
44:31 - um
44:32 - effects from from the virus but
44:37 - it's still good to get somebody you know
44:39 - somebody that's there
44:41 - uh get kind of their account of it
44:43 - but
44:44 - let's see
44:46 - let's go back to
44:48 - all right here so i'm gonna give
44:51 - what i'm gonna do i'm gonna completely
44:53 - quit at the expo app and go back in and
44:56 - see if i can
44:58 - get the new app to load
45:02 - and
45:04 - so let's scan this
45:07 - let me go in here
45:14 - uh okay unfortunately it's still the
45:17 - old app i am gonna try to do a little
45:20 - shake
45:22 - i guess this is supposed to work i don't
45:24 - know why it's not working do i not have
45:28 - i don't yeah i don't understand why it's
45:30 - not working
45:36 - okay
45:37 - um so
45:39 - unfortunately i can't get the developer
45:42 - menu to load
45:46 - so i may have to
45:48 - check out android studio
45:50 - like i'm not going to try to do the
45:52 - install for android studio right now so
45:54 - we may just have to
45:57 - um
45:58 - hmm
46:05 - i'm gonna try to run this
46:16 - i mean i really don't think
46:22 - yeah i didn't think that would work
46:26 - okay
46:27 - and this it looks like these directions
46:29 - are assuming that we're running on a mac
46:34 - so it may be that i just can't use these
46:36 - instructions for
46:38 - um
46:38 - a windows machine
46:45 - let me see
46:50 - i'm just going to check the chat really
46:52 - quick to see if anybody put the um
46:58 - if anybody had any idea how i could get
47:00 - this to refresh
47:05 - looks like
47:15 - oh my god
47:39 - okay
47:40 - um
47:43 - let's see
47:44 - [Music]
47:45 - all right so
47:48 - i guess we just do a quick google search
47:50 - right because
47:52 - if we can't test the uh the features on
47:55 - a mobile device then we're gonna be a
47:57 - little bit stuck here so
47:58 - uh let me say
48:08 - android
48:20 - all right
48:21 - let's just open up a few of them
48:23 - uh
48:24 - open up your simulator
48:48 - so that i can press ctrl m
48:50 - let's see about that
48:55 - all right looks like that is not working
48:58 - i wonder if i can
49:01 - if i change the mode that doesn't really
49:04 - do anything
49:15 - oh yeah do you have some messages here
49:21 - hmm no i don't think that works okay
49:27 - the only thing i can think of
49:29 - if i do a save
49:30 - will that trigger
49:34 - looks like it's only triggering
49:37 - a web
49:39 - refresh
49:54 - okay
49:56 - um
50:02 - let me go back to here
50:05 - all right so
50:07 - control-m did not work
50:14 - development node enabled
50:16 - i believe we do
50:19 - but let's double check make sure we have
50:21 - dev mode enabled
50:29 - yep we did make sure i
50:31 - double check
50:32 - yep we turned off production mode so it
50:34 - is dev mode
50:51 - hmm
51:01 - i just hit r to restart metro bundler
51:05 - just to see if that would do anything
51:08 - which it did not
51:12 - okay
51:14 - all right let's try this one
51:16 - this will refresh
51:40 - all right let's see this one too
51:44 - all right i don't think that's gonna
51:45 - help
51:47 - sorry i'm just trying i'm not reading
51:48 - this out loud i'm trying to skim through
51:49 - first to see if these are even um
51:53 - like close to what what we're
51:54 - experiencing
52:00 - this looks like android studio
52:05 - so that's not what we what we want okay
52:09 - um let's see i'm gonna try to change
52:11 - something in here and see if a uh if
52:14 - saving it would would do anything so i
52:16 - guess probably the easiest thing to
52:17 - change would be
52:19 - some text
52:20 - so let's add in an extra space
52:26 - see if we get an update
52:33 - looks like nothing i didn't see anything
52:35 - on the screen
52:37 - uh you know this this is still updating
52:43 - you know we could try to do i could try
52:44 - to just completely uh quit
52:49 - and then
52:51 - start it up again
52:52 - see if we can get a difference with the
52:54 - you know total restart
53:04 - and
53:06 - we can press a
53:08 - to run the android emulator
53:18 - let's see what we have
53:24 - see what other commands we have so
53:39 - all right current mode is development
53:40 - mode which is good that's what it needs
53:42 - to be
53:44 - uh let's do shift r
53:46 - because that should restart and clear
53:49 - the uh cache maybe that would help
53:52 - shift r
54:01 - maybe this will help
54:04 - all right
54:05 - while that's running i'm going to go to
54:06 - the chat and see what's what's going on
54:09 - in the chat here
54:21 - oh cool so uh alex is in the chat and
54:23 - he's uh one of the founders of neurosci
54:26 - that's the company that makes this this
54:28 - headset and he said that the the gamma
54:30 - brain waves are what determines your
54:32 - focus so the higher your gamma brain
54:33 - wave the higher your focus so
54:35 - uh
54:36 - that's pretty cool
54:44 - um william says i'm learning python are
54:46 - apis the equivalent to modules
54:49 - um
54:50 - i i think api is pretty standard no
54:52 - matter what the language is so
54:56 - i'm not exactly sure in python what
54:58 - module means
55:01 - but
55:02 - i don't think it would be the equivalent
55:04 - of an api if anybody is more
55:07 - knowledgeable about python though please
55:09 - please let us know
55:22 - uh mr own said i love this awesome thank
55:24 - you
55:31 - uh
55:32 - jp
55:33 - games says is your job stressful um i
55:36 - wouldn't really say my job is stressful
55:38 - um
55:39 - it
55:40 - right now um
55:42 - the
55:43 - project that i'm working on
55:45 - is still like in development
55:47 - so we're not really there's not a lot
55:50 - that's dependent on our project yet
55:53 - that's going to change once we start
55:54 - like releasing uh to more locations so
55:58 - it will get a little bit more stressful
56:00 - but right now it's it's not it's not too
56:02 - bad
56:04 - programming i'd say in general
56:06 - in itself is not stressful
56:09 - but
56:10 - depending on what project you're working
56:12 - on and what's at stake with the project
56:13 - it could be stressed like there are
56:15 - external factors that could be stressful
56:19 - all right so this thing's still
56:20 - still doing its thing which is fine
56:22 - because it gives me time to catch up on
56:24 - the chat
56:27 - uh ssdu
56:30 - if i could explain what i'm doing
56:33 - uh looks like somebody else answered in
56:35 - the chat though so
56:37 - um
56:39 - so thank you for uh for answering that
56:43 - um jpgames asks what's your favorite
56:45 - musical actor group uh i don't know if i
56:48 - could do a favorite i like a lot of
56:50 - different kinds of music
56:51 - i don't really know if i have
56:54 - like a favorite
56:55 - um
56:59 - yeah i don't know i'd have to think
57:00 - about it that's crazy that i never
57:02 - thought about that
57:04 - yeah i don't know what
57:05 - my favorite would be
57:09 - um
57:10 - mustafa asked if i stream about react.js
57:13 - yeah i do uh streams with react.js so
57:16 - um
57:17 - right now i'm more focusing on react
57:19 - native that's what i work with uh more
57:21 - frequently uh but i have done streams
57:24 - that are just normal react and i'll
57:26 - probably end up doing some normal react
57:28 - stuff as well
57:36 - daniel says i'm from brazil but i have a
57:38 - cousin that lives in ohio uh
57:41 - around avon oh okay that's awesome cool
57:47 - kevin's from california okay daniel says
57:49 - avon lake okay i'm not really sure where
57:52 - yvonne lake is so tell you truth i'm not
57:53 - originally from ohio i'm from west
57:55 - virginia uh so i don't
57:58 - like i've lived in
58:04 - oh
58:05 - i started to get
58:06 - a little bit of lag i don't know if it's
58:07 - from this running or
58:09 - the internet is messed up it looks like
58:12 - the stream is still okay so
58:14 - let me know if there's anything wrong
58:15 - with the stream i think we're good
58:18 - uh but my my mouse rose up for a minute
58:20 - there hey progress
58:26 - selim is uh from israel welcome
58:29 - [Music]
58:32 - someone else from cali too
58:35 - somewhere from vancouver canada
58:38 - that's great i love when we have people
58:39 - from all over for these streams
58:41 - uh vail valedark says how much have you
58:44 - researched about brain computer
58:45 - interfaces uh i haven't done a ton of
58:48 - research um myself
58:50 - i'm interested in it and you know i'll
58:52 - read articles when i see them
58:55 - but i haven't um
58:57 - i wouldn't say that i'm an expert you
58:59 - know at all my main work is in
59:02 - you know using javascript uh mostly
59:04 - react uh to build you know apps
59:08 - so uh i'm not really a brain computer
59:10 - interface researcher but i'm more of
59:12 - just kind of like uh
59:13 - do i'm into it as a hobby yeah like i i
59:17 - see it as something that could be really
59:18 - awesome and helpful for a lot of people
59:20 - that you know i'd like to do more with
59:23 - uh whenever i can
59:25 - kind of like just on the side
59:29 - uh bulat says my school is closed for a
59:32 - month gym is closed as well trying to
59:34 - learn react native with jessie awesome
59:36 - well uh hopefully you learned something
59:38 - um that stinks i know a lot of the gyms
59:40 - are closed
59:42 - i i like to go to the gym and work out
59:44 - that's going to be kind of hard i was uh
59:46 - i told my kids earlier that i'm gonna
59:49 - start uh using them as weights and doing
59:52 - squats with them or something because uh
59:54 - i can't go to the gym
59:57 - i think i don't know if all the gems
59:59 - around where i am are closed yet or not
60:02 - i don't know for sure
60:04 - uh but probably
60:06 - probably not a great idea to go to the
60:08 - gym although there are some gyms that
60:09 - are open 24 hours a day and i kind of
60:11 - wonder like if i went there
60:14 - like very very early in the morning you
60:16 - know could i get in and be like the only
60:18 - person in there you know that might work
60:23 - [Music]
60:38 - let's see
60:42 - [Music]
60:46 - has there been any progress on this
60:47 - thing
60:49 - let's
60:52 - i'm going to close out
60:56 - some of these screens here
61:05 - i'm gonna stop that and maybe
61:11 - try it again
61:23 - [Music]
61:28 - i probably should do an update on this
61:29 - when i can
61:31 - uh
61:32 - all right let's see
61:33 - [Music]
61:36 - what was it shift
61:38 - i think was shift r was that it
61:41 - [Music]
61:43 - see if it goes any faster this time
61:45 - we'll give it one more shot if that
61:46 - doesn't work then uh
61:48 - i don't know then maybe we'll
61:51 - um
61:53 - maybe we'll take a break from trying to
61:55 - get the mobile version running uh on
61:57 - this stream and and see if we can do
61:59 - something else
62:00 - i kind of want to wrap up soon anyway
62:01 - though
62:03 - so i think i've hit my hour
62:05 - my hour limit of what i wanted to do
62:08 - so we did get a little bit accomplished
62:09 - today
62:10 - let's see
62:16 - [Music]
62:23 - oh
62:32 - [Music]
62:35 - uh valvedark says you could try running
62:37 - it in the emulator first then on the
62:38 - phone i really i want to but i don't
62:40 - have the um
62:42 - uh the android emulator installed
62:46 - and i don't since i'm on a pc i can't i
62:49 - don't think i can run the ios i guess i
62:51 - could try but i'm pretty sure i can't
62:53 - yeah i need to have xcode
62:54 - um
62:56 - installed
62:58 - which
62:59 - i'm almost positive you can't run xcode
63:02 - on
63:04 - on windows
63:13 - hey did it work that time
63:17 - nice
63:25 - all right let's give this one more shot
63:44 - let's reopen expo
63:56 - oh i think it's working
64:00 - all right clearing the cash oh he's a
64:02 - good strategy
64:03 - [Laughter]
64:05 - let's see
64:07 - almost we're 99
64:10 - 99.4
64:12 - [Laughter]
64:14 - sweet all right check it out if you can
64:16 - see this that's our
64:18 - our red background
64:20 - so i'm not um i'm not focused right now
64:22 - so i would need to actually log in on
64:25 - this device
64:26 - which oh my gosh that's going to be a
64:28 - pain
64:32 - let's see
64:36 - all right so we have it on this device
64:39 - let's just test out the uh the vibration
64:42 - feature
64:43 - just to see if we can get it working on
64:44 - a device now that we're actually hooked
64:46 - up so what i want to do is uh we've
64:49 - imported vibrate and what i think i'll
64:50 - do is say uh
64:53 - like when we press
64:54 - this button so the button right now runs
64:57 - in it
64:58 - so let's just use
65:00 - vibration dot vibrate
65:03 - and then
65:06 - we could just do a pattern number uh
65:10 - we can do a
65:14 - what's the pattern i'm gonna have to
65:15 - look again i don't remember exactly what
65:17 - it
65:22 - what it was
65:28 - [Music]
65:30 - oh there we go
65:31 - um
65:33 - oh i remember what what got us to this
65:35 - anyway is we had uh
65:39 - we needed to put something in our
65:41 - android file
65:44 - didn't we need to
65:47 - but i don't think we have it
65:52 - so this is our web package
65:55 - and what was it our
66:00 - android
66:01 - manifest.xml which i don't think we even
66:03 - have
66:05 - so let's see if we can get it to work
66:07 - without that
66:12 - and
66:15 - okay it looks like we can just put a a
66:18 - duration in
66:22 - just as a number
66:25 - and what is that i'm assuming that's
66:27 - milliseconds so we got like 10 seconds
66:29 - here so i'm going to save that
66:39 - okay cool i think that worked
66:42 - so i'm gonna press it
66:44 - cool i don't know if you can hear that
66:45 - [Music]
66:47 - but
66:48 - the phone is vibrating so our vibration
66:50 - works now unfortunately we got an error
66:53 - come up which i i think we got the error
66:55 - because we didn't actually fill in any
66:56 - of the fields
66:57 - so uh
67:00 - i have that ad name so we've got we got
67:03 - some sort of error but our vibration
67:06 - works that's really cool so
67:08 - we can get the device to vibrate
67:10 - so now it's just a matter of getting the
67:12 - device to vibrate when the state dips
67:15 - below a certain
67:17 - uh a certain amount
67:19 - right so
67:20 - that's what we want to happen
67:23 - now i'm assuming if if we actually built
67:26 - something for android like to release on
67:30 - you know the app store then we would
67:32 - probably get that android manifest file
67:34 - since we're running it through the expo
67:36 - app i think we don't have to bother with
67:38 - that right now
67:40 - so we'll just have to remember this when
67:42 - we go to bundle list i'd love to
67:44 - actually build this and put it on the
67:45 - app store for anybody else who has this
67:47 - headset
67:48 - um to uh to be able to use so that would
67:51 - be really cool
67:52 - also uh youtube analytics is telling me
67:55 - the the signal for my stream is not
67:58 - really good right now so let me know if
68:00 - you can still
68:02 - see what's happening on the stream
68:08 - all cool
68:09 - that's really cool
68:10 - now what we need to do though is
68:14 - let's see we need to figure out how to
68:16 - set that off based on
68:21 - let's see
68:24 - hmm
68:28 - let's get rid of that console log that
68:30 - keeps coming up in my my console
68:32 - so you don't want that
68:35 - so right now it's it's all based on the
68:37 - state
68:39 - what we could do is say
68:41 - maybe make a use effect
68:45 - let's make one down here
68:48 - so let's use use effect
68:50 - okay so use effect is a react hook
68:53 - that will allow us
68:56 - to
68:57 - do something
68:59 - anytime
69:02 - a piece of of data changes and in this
69:05 - case we're going to track that focus
69:09 - right so anytime focus changes we're
69:11 - going to do a check and we're going to
69:13 - say
69:15 - if focus
69:17 - keep doing this to me
69:19 - if focus
69:22 - um
69:23 - is
69:24 - greater than
69:26 - whoops i'm gonna say less than
69:29 - um
69:32 - we say
69:33 - 0.2
69:36 - yeah you know i was gonna do this as a
69:37 - ternary but
69:39 - yeah actually we could do it as a
69:43 - we're using this statement it's a little
69:45 - bit more clear so focus is great less
69:48 - than point
69:49 - 0.2
69:51 - then
69:52 - we're going to
69:54 - do vibrate
69:56 - or vibration dot vibrate
69:58 - and we'll just do
70:01 - we'll do 10 seconds
70:05 - else
70:09 - we're going to do
70:10 - vibration
70:13 - dot cancel
70:17 - and cancel looks like doesn't take
70:19 - anything
70:21 - um as an argument and it returns void so
70:24 - what this will do is uh it'll
70:25 - automatically cancel the vibration when
70:27 - we regain focus
70:30 - [Music]
70:32 - so
70:33 - right now we have nothing
70:35 - because i didn't log in so
70:38 - it's just continuing to vibrate
70:41 - for 10 seconds right so we got the
70:43 - vibration so basically we know that
70:45 - works now which is awesome
70:48 - uh what we should do though probably is
70:50 - is say
70:51 - um
70:52 - [Music]
70:54 - maybe we want to wrap this entire thing
70:57 - in another if statement
71:00 - that says uh if if we're actually
71:03 - you know logged in so i guess if notion
71:08 - is that what we want or do you want to
71:09 - say use it probably user is better
71:13 - so if we have a user
71:16 - then we want to
71:18 - you want to do this right so we don't
71:19 - want to do this we're logged in so let's
71:20 - save it
71:22 - and make sure
71:23 - okay so we save that now we're not
71:24 - getting a vibration this time
71:28 - that way
71:31 - that's good so we won't vibrate let's
71:32 - take out this vibrate on the
71:39 - on that button press
71:44 - okay cool
71:46 - and also let's say
71:51 - for the background
71:52 - color at least for the first screen i
71:55 - don't know that i really want it to
71:57 - start out as red
71:58 - i want it to be white so
72:02 - we may need to switch that up as well
72:04 - and maybe say
72:08 - um
72:18 - [Music]
72:22 - uh if focus is less than two or
72:30 - uh where's my or at
72:31 - [Music]
72:33 - why can't i find this
72:36 - oh
72:38 - or
72:42 - we have a
72:44 - or we don't have user
72:47 - there we go let's see if that fixes that
72:52 - i should say
72:56 - no i don't want
72:59 - if focus is and we have a user that's
73:01 - what we need
73:04 - all right so
73:07 - if the focus
73:09 - is less than 0.2 and we have a user
73:13 - which means like we're actually logged
73:14 - in then we want it to be red
73:16 - cool
73:17 - so that changes so you can see now like
73:19 - uh the screen is white so we're not
73:21 - logged in and the screen stays white so
73:24 - now only if you're logged in and the
73:26 - focus is less than 0.2
73:29 - then it'll be red that's cool the red
73:31 - wasn't really a good look for the entire
73:32 - background to be read not that the uh
73:35 - you know the application is not like
73:39 - super good looking right now
73:41 - uh but
73:43 - functionally
73:44 - this is this is basically a complete
73:46 - application at this point which is
73:47 - pretty insane so
73:49 - uh that it only took us three three live
73:52 - streams to do this uh so i i have let me
73:55 - let me look this up on my other screen i
73:58 - um
74:00 - um i outlined what i wanted for the
74:03 - basic nvp uh meaning uh minimum viable
74:07 - product
74:08 - for this project
74:10 - i made a little outline for myself and
74:12 - i'm gonna try to i'm going to bring it
74:13 - up on the other screen to make sure
74:14 - we've met all the requirements
74:18 - so the requirements were
74:20 - um an android app that links to notion
74:23 - and alerts when focus falls below a
74:25 - certain level so that was it those are
74:27 - the base
74:28 - requirements
74:29 - so at this point if i could get this
74:31 - bundled
74:32 - for android
74:36 - then that will meet the
74:38 - the mvp
74:39 - and i think we can uh we can release
74:42 - that on the app store
74:44 - so i think on our next stream
74:46 - i'd love to actually do the
74:48 - the release to the app store if i can
74:51 - so what i'll need to do beforehand
74:53 - though is probably
74:55 - do a little bit of research to make sure
74:56 - i have everything good on my end i
74:58 - already have an account
75:00 - uh with the app store
75:02 - so i'm good there
75:05 - so before the next time i stream i'll do
75:07 - the research for that and then maybe if
75:09 - if you all think it would be
75:10 - you know good to do i'll try to do like
75:13 - the build
75:14 - and release
75:15 - to the app store
75:17 - um on the next stream
75:19 - so i don't know how long it takes to get
75:21 - approved to go in the app store but at
75:22 - least we can do the release there and
75:24 - just a heads up like the improvements
75:26 - that i have here
75:27 - in stages where the step two would be
75:30 - um
75:32 - release an ios version of the app which
75:35 - should be
75:36 - not that hard because the same version
75:38 - should work for ios
75:40 - the only thing i'll need to do is get
75:42 - an app developer account for ios
75:45 - and
75:47 - i may need to do that release on my on
75:49 - my mac
75:50 - that build and release or do some
75:52 - testing on my mac not on my pc uh the
75:54 - next step after that would be give users
75:56 - the ability to set the level of focus
75:58 - they want the alert to come in at
76:01 - which
76:02 - that should be a pretty easy um
76:05 - improvement to add after that i want to
76:07 - give options for the type of alert a
76:09 - user wants so i'm thinking maybe you
76:12 - know do you want vibration do you want
76:13 - the color to change do you want maybe
76:15 - some sort of sound
76:17 - after that make it available for android
76:19 - auto
76:20 - okay and that's kind of cool i think
76:21 - that'll that will actually be very
76:23 - useful to people uh and maybe preventing
76:25 - accidents
76:26 - um but i've never done anything with
76:28 - android auto before in terms of
76:30 - developing so we'll see how that goes
76:32 - after that i want to release the web app
76:35 - version
76:36 - uh which i get that's not going to be
76:38 - hard like we already have it running as
76:40 - a web app so
76:41 - i could maybe move that up
76:44 - and uh and do that a little bit sooner
76:48 - um
76:49 - yeah so i could probably change the
76:51 - order on that because that's not going
76:52 - to be very difficult especially with
76:54 - with how expo lets you
76:56 - run it as a web app
76:58 - and you know get that all up and running
77:00 - i could probably just release it uh at
77:02 - like github pages maybe um and and have
77:05 - that working
77:07 - uh and then the last step i had was see
77:10 - if we can make it into an alexa app
77:12 - which that's a big step right so that'll
77:14 - be um you know totally different code
77:16 - but i thought that might be kind of cool
77:18 - if you could do an alexa app uh that you
77:21 - could just have that running and connect
77:23 - up uh so
77:26 - that's that's my uh
77:28 - kind of my game plan
77:30 - for in my goals for uh for the focus
77:33 - it's been a long time since i've done an
77:34 - alex alexa app so a lot has probably
77:37 - changed since then since then i may have
77:39 - to do a little research on that
77:42 - uh before we do it but
77:44 - anyway uh that's cool i definitely want
77:46 - to get android studio running so i can
77:48 - um demo this in the uh the android
77:52 - emulator so you all can see i know it's
77:54 - it's just super hard to see it i wonder
77:56 - if i i think the light's messing it up
77:59 - if it's easy i think that actually makes
78:01 - it harder
78:02 - but like here's the app running on my
78:04 - phone i know it's it's very hard to see
78:06 - so like just so you can see it it
78:08 - actually is running i just need to log
78:10 - in
78:11 - the password and device id are super
78:13 - long
78:14 - so that's why i didn't try to log in yet
78:17 - but
78:18 - i am making an assumption that that
78:19 - actually works on the device
78:21 - um i'm assuming it does
78:24 - at this point
78:25 - but um
78:26 - all right cool so
78:28 - i'm gonna
78:29 - let's see i'm gonna take the device off
78:33 - and
78:35 - i'm gonna turn my device off
78:38 - for now i'm gonna finish answering some
78:41 - questions and then finish up i gotta i
78:43 - gotta help get the kids to bed they're
78:45 - probably waiting on me so
78:46 - uh
78:48 - i don't know if i'll be able to answer
78:49 - all the questions but i'll do my best
78:53 - and actually let's let's uh
78:56 - make this
78:59 - um
79:00 - let's send what we have up to github so
79:02 - you all can check out the code if you
79:04 - want
79:08 - so we're going to do a git add
79:10 - give it the am flag
79:13 - and
79:14 - feed feature let's see what did we add
79:18 - um
79:24 - vibrate on mobile
79:26 - it'll be ile when
79:28 - uh
79:30 - focus
79:32 - falls below
79:34 - 0.2
79:37 - [Music]
79:40 - oh did i mess it up what did i do
79:46 - oh i didn't get
79:48 - get out it needs to be get commit
79:50 - [Music]
79:56 - there we go okay
80:02 - you push
80:04 - sweet all right so that code should be
80:06 - on github now the link to the github
80:07 - repo is in the description uh so you can
80:10 - check out that code if you want i saw a
80:12 - few you already looked like you checked
80:13 - you you checked it out and like forked
80:15 - it and started and stuff so um you know
80:18 - definitely feel free to open any issues
80:20 - or anything with that code or a pull
80:22 - request if you see something that's like
80:24 - um that you would like to contribute or
80:27 - some obvious problem with the code
80:30 - definitely i'm always open to uh to new
80:32 - suggestions
80:33 - uh and open to collaborate on things
80:38 - all right i'm gonna try to find where i
80:39 - left off in the chat
80:42 - [Music]
80:48 - all right so uh
80:49 - ty corty says uh what's the interface
80:52 - between your brain and the device how do
80:54 - you control it
80:55 - um
80:59 - the um
81:00 - it's uh i'm assuming it's the you're
81:03 - talking about this notion headset uh for
81:05 - now for what we're doing we um
81:08 - it just tracks
81:10 - the
81:11 - gamma waves that your brain is is
81:13 - putting off uh and that tells you your
81:16 - level of focus there's a lot of other
81:17 - cool stuff we can do with it which we
81:19 - will do
81:20 - uh i hope to make other apps that will
81:23 - allow you to think of doing an action
81:26 - and then make things happen in the app
81:29 - or on other internet of things devices
81:31 - so
81:32 - uh i hope to make that happen this is
81:34 - kind of my first idea for an app if i
81:36 - can get this working i'm gonna move on
81:37 - to more challenging things maybe some
81:39 - some more fun stuff
81:48 - let's see
82:06 - okay uh beverly says
82:08 - we had a question earlier about a python
82:10 - question about whether an api and a
82:12 - module were like python modules beverly
82:15 - says uh
82:17 - that
82:18 - modules in python are more equivalent to
82:20 - libraries
82:22 - so uh
82:23 - that's what i thought
82:24 - uh but i wasn't you know obviously i
82:26 - don't have enough experience with python
82:28 - to really say for sure so i didn't want
82:29 - to say anything um but yeah that's so um
82:34 - in in python lingo i guess we would
82:37 - modules are what we would call libraries
82:39 - in javascript
82:41 - [Music]
82:50 - okay ty corty is like i would like to
82:52 - learn more about your project like
82:54 - papers etc i would like to make a thesis
82:56 - on brain computer interfaces could you
82:58 - help okay um i would check out
83:02 - check out the uh neurosci website um
83:05 - it's neurocity dot let me let me put the
83:08 - link in the chat
83:10 - it's neurocity.co
83:17 - and see if you can get like the contact
83:19 - info or you know twitter or something
83:22 - i'm putting that in the chat right now
83:24 - uh contact the people at nerocity and
83:27 - see if they have any more data for you
83:29 - because you know they're the ones that
83:30 - are really working on the brain computer
83:32 - interface side of things and we'll have
83:34 - way more knowledge than i will about it
83:36 - they might be able to help you out with
83:38 - more of the technical info
83:41 - [Music]
83:46 - ruben says react native or flutter we
83:48 - had a question like this on the last
83:49 - stream i have not used flutter so i
83:51 - don't think i can give a good um
83:55 - a good answer to that question okay so i
83:57 - mean i use react native it works for
83:59 - what what i do um but maybe for you know
84:02 - for other teams with different skill
84:04 - sets uh you know maybe maybe flutter
84:07 - would be the better choice
84:08 - i'm just not sure
84:21 - [Music]
84:26 - well we've got everybody's kind of
84:27 - calling out where they're from so we got
84:29 - baltimore cali indianapolis
84:33 - hungary
84:34 - [Music]
84:40 - we were talking about gyms earlier um
84:44 - and uh mr coldwater canyon says gyms
84:46 - aren't all that sanitary
84:49 - yeah i imagine they're not you know you
84:50 - got a bunch of people sweating and stuff
84:52 - on the machine so
84:53 - um
84:55 - yeah probably not the best place to be
84:57 - you know during a virus outbreak
85:00 - [Music]
85:17 - uh that valdarg says how do you narrow
85:19 - down what you're meant to be focusing on
85:20 - just focus in general seems a bit vague
85:22 - to be useful
85:24 - yeah i'm like i said i'm not sure what
85:26 - the science is in terms of how the brain
85:29 - operates but um alex who was one of the
85:31 - creators of the generosity
85:33 - uh
85:34 - notion headset
85:36 - said the uh the gamma waves are an
85:38 - indicator of the level of focus your
85:40 - brain has so i don't know that it's a
85:43 - specific focus like you could tell
85:45 - exactly what you were focusing on but
85:47 - it's more a general level of focus uh so
85:51 - yeah i i mean
85:52 - i'd love to see
85:54 - when you know get this up and running
85:56 - and really test it out on a variety of
85:58 - different things that i'm doing and see
86:00 - you know how it works if it is specific
86:02 - enough to be useful
86:04 - you know or not
86:12 - and someone says i need to learn this
86:13 - i'm using cordova to build web apps and
86:15 - run them on android
86:16 - yeah i i i messed around with cordovia a
86:19 - little bit back in the day
86:21 - i do find
86:22 - react native to be a bit easier but i i
86:25 - do use react a lot so it is easier for
86:28 - me uh if if you didn't know that much
86:30 - about react then cordova might be a
86:32 - little easier to go but in general i
86:34 - think um like i haven't used any of the
86:37 - newer versions of cordova but in general
86:39 - i believe that uh
86:42 - react native
86:43 - um is
86:45 - kind of a better way to go for most use
86:47 - cases
86:51 - [Music]
86:57 - let's see
86:59 - uh valedor says okay this is a good
87:01 - point basically the point is
87:03 - you know if you're driving and you're
87:05 - trying to measure focus so you should be
87:06 - driving on the road what if you have a
87:08 - lot of focus on something else instead
87:10 - of driving the app would still you know
87:12 - would the app still register that as
87:14 - focus and not warn you i don't know i
87:16 - really need to test that uh so a lot of
87:19 - this stuff i i kind of wondered about as
87:21 - well like
87:23 - will this really provide
87:24 - a
87:25 - you know good thing in terms of focus so
87:28 - i um
87:30 - in terms of like measuring what you
87:31 - really want to focus on so i just
87:34 - need to test it out and see how useful
87:35 - it is
87:41 - i had a question what should this app do
87:42 - after it is finished it should warn you
87:44 - whenever your levels of focus have
87:45 - dropped below a certain threshold
87:48 - [Music]
87:58 - let's see
88:02 - scott says vs code update available i
88:04 - know there's
88:05 - there's an update available i usually
88:06 - stay updated um you know like every time
88:09 - it comes up but the last two days i've
88:12 - opened up vs code right before the live
88:13 - stream and i didn't want to do the
88:15 - update then because i needed to stream
88:17 - so i just put it off till later
88:25 - [Music]
88:27 - uh we got hi from australia uh hi from
88:30 - india
88:31 - awesome
88:35 - um carlos says is there any way to
88:37 - develop django web applications with a
88:39 - 32-bit architecture system i i have no
88:42 - idea i've never done anything with
88:44 - django so so i don't know if anybody
88:47 - knows anything about django please
88:49 - let us know in the chat
88:53 - [Music]
89:05 - it says hello from bangladesh awesome
89:08 - welcome
89:09 - kev
89:10 - kevin has said hello from so many
89:13 - different places in the chat
89:15 - i'm not sure where kevin is really from
89:18 - at this point
89:20 - uh
89:21 - greetings from poland how's it going
89:27 - all right
89:28 - cool i um oh carla says hi from
89:31 - venezuela awesome hey i'm gonna um wrap
89:34 - this up so i've gone over by 30 minutes
89:37 - what i wanted to go over so
89:39 - i definitely got to get
89:41 - help the kids get ready for bed
89:44 - uh at this point thank you all so much
89:46 - for watching
89:47 - i'm really excited you know we pretty
89:49 - much we we have this working the next
89:51 - step is just to
89:53 - build it and release it to the app store
89:55 - probably want to make it look a little
89:56 - bit nicer first the ui is not
89:59 - not great at this point
90:01 - so maybe we'll work on that as well for
90:03 - the next stream
90:05 - but uh it was a good stream i um
90:09 - a lot of troubleshooting just remember
90:11 - uh if if your um
90:14 - metro bundler is not working correctly
90:16 - try clearing the cache and that should
90:18 - work that that worked uh for us and
90:22 - it's worked for me in the past as well
90:24 - uh now that i think about it that's
90:26 - always a good thing to try
90:28 - um
90:30 - so uh
90:31 - i don't know when i'll stream again
90:33 - tomorrow be a little bit busier i'll be
90:35 - back to work uh but
90:37 - i i want to try to at the very least
90:40 - maybe stream
90:41 - you know at the latest some point you
90:43 - know next week uh next weekend hopefully
90:45 - i can get a stream in there before then
90:47 - though because i'm getting really
90:48 - excited because we're really close to
90:50 - actually launching uh this app uh which
90:54 - that'll be fun it would be my first app
90:55 - that i've actually decided to put on the
90:57 - app store i usually never get to that
90:59 - point i just build something and play
91:00 - with it a little bit and then just don't
91:02 - do anything with it so
91:05 - um
91:06 - anyway
91:07 - everyone you know everybody be safe out
91:09 - there uh don't take any uh unnecessary
91:12 - risks you know uh try to help each other
91:14 - out
91:15 - i know you know some depending on where
91:17 - you're from you know things are pretty
91:19 - rough right now
91:21 - but uh thanks for joining me
91:23 - and uh stay safe i know a lot of people
91:25 - at home so i'm gonna do my best to try
91:27 - to stream a little bit more and
91:29 - maybe uh
91:30 - it'll make things a little bit easier
91:31 - for everybody that's that's stuck at
91:33 - home
91:34 - um yeah but until next time
91:37 - uh have a great rest of your weekend
91:39 - have a great week and i'll see you later
