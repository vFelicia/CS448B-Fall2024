00:03 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:06 - with Jesse I'm Jesse and today we're
00:08 - gonna be working with some react
00:10 - components if you were with us yesterday
00:13 - you know that we upgraded to the latest
00:16 - version of material UI since version 1.2
00:19 - point O we had a lot of breaking changes
00:22 - that we had to deal with and now we're
00:25 - gonna go through and we're gonna edit
00:27 - some components to adjust to some of the
00:32 - things that change so they weren't
00:33 - exactly breaking we're not getting
00:35 - errors in the console anymore but the
00:37 - Styles are a little bit off now so we're
00:40 - gonna change some things up and see how
00:45 - far we get with that I'm thinking maybe
00:47 - an hour for the stream hour and a half
00:50 - depending on how many questions there
00:51 - are and let me check the stream health
00:57 - quickly let me know if the streams okay
01:03 - it was showing that the stream health
01:06 - was not good which is really weird
01:07 - because everything else is showing up as
01:09 - is okay so yeah just let me know if
01:13 - everyone can see and hear me all right
01:15 - and then if so we will get started
01:25 - I'm going to get that code ready on my
01:27 - other screen and then switch over
01:41 - all right cool looks like it there are
01:43 - no problem with one off Thank You Teresa
01:49 - and Nikki okay let's switch over alright
01:57 - so here's the code if you are working on
02:00 - this project locally if you have a fork
02:02 - or something like that of the repo if
02:06 - you have any issues when you when you
02:09 - pull in the latest changes delete your
02:14 - node modules and then run yarn again so
02:20 - I had to do that because I had some
02:22 - issues and that fixed everything so
02:26 - that's generally a good thing to try
02:28 - when you're having some weird issues and
02:30 - you're not sure why if it works it'll
02:33 - save you a lot of time and you know if
02:36 - it doesn't work then you know you've
02:39 - you've wasted maybe you know a minute or
02:41 - two depending on how fast your computer
02:43 - is char Belle says don't start now no
02:49 - one is here yet alright well there is
02:51 - one thing I want to fill you in on so I
02:54 - guess I can stall for another minute or
03:00 - so I don't want to wait too long
03:02 - I interviewed another potential student
03:09 - worker today and he seemed really
03:11 - interested in working on some of the
03:13 - data cleanup so I'm hoping now that I
03:16 - have like two or three you know student
03:21 - workers that should be able to start
03:23 - some time like in like the next two
03:25 - weeks so I'm gonna stop with a lot of
03:29 - the data cleanup that I've been doing
03:30 - that's been taking up most of my time
03:32 - and I'm gonna shift into you know
03:36 - dealing a lot more with the actual react
03:39 - side of things and maybe even start in
03:42 - on doing some some testing using
03:47 - lighthouse to try to get the site like
03:50 - really fast and
03:52 - get that accessibility score up as high
03:55 - as I can so it may not affect the
03:59 - streams and that much except that you
04:02 - know they'll probably be more getting
04:05 - done on the react side of things between
04:06 - streams and hey everybody see rotates
04:13 - here's a nice okay so yeah we gained
04:16 - about five more people in that that the
04:20 - last minute or so so I think we're gonna
04:22 - get started it's still a little bit
04:24 - lower than normal but I think it's it's
04:29 - cool to get started so it's like we have
04:32 - 15 viewers which is definitely way lower
04:34 - than normal but I mean when I started I
04:37 - would have one viewer I'm fine with
04:41 - streaming without very many people okay
04:46 - so we do have our code up here just in
04:48 - case you didn't get to watch the last
04:49 - you know stream this has changed and
04:52 - this is a big change so we have we now
04:56 - have material UI and I'm gonna probably
04:59 - remove this code mod at some point this
05:01 - was help with migration but I couldn't
05:03 - get it to work so we have at material UI
05:07 - core and at material UI I cons and this
05:10 - has replaced the other material UI
05:11 - packages so we've updated to the latest
05:14 - stable version and we're going to
05:16 - continue with a stable version this
05:19 - makes me more comfortable as we approach
05:21 - going live that we're no longer on the
05:25 - beta like latest release track so I was
05:30 - fine with that when we were developing
05:32 - but it's nice that we can switch to the
05:35 - stable here before we launch alright so
05:40 - and the biggest changes have just been
05:41 - around this where we've had to adjust to
05:44 - a lot of like the changes to the API
05:49 - alright so let me let me pull over on
05:53 - this screen
05:59 - let me there we go
06:05 - I thought we already had some local
06:07 - loose open I'll get rid of this we'll
06:12 - just wait for this to load there we go
06:16 - and let me start my Pomodoro timer so
06:21 - I'm gonna code now for about 25 minutes
06:22 - and then I'll get back to the live chat
06:24 - and answer some questions if you have
06:26 - questions go ahead and put them in the
06:27 - chat but I won't get to them for about
06:29 - 25 minutes if you can't stick around for
06:34 - that you can always watch that's weird
06:38 - let me refresh that there we go okay
06:44 - that was kind of an odd odd glitch okay
06:49 - so here's the first problem that I'd
06:52 - like to deal with right now this may end
06:54 - up being just a CSS thing so we may not
06:58 - we'll see how much we have to change for
07:00 - this but since we updated this is
07:04 - happening and I don't want this to be an
07:06 - oval it's supposed to be a circle I was
07:08 - able to narrow down exactly why it's
07:10 - happening basically once the window
07:13 - width gets you know wide enough the
07:17 - height of this element which is a button
07:21 - goes to 70 pixels but the width remains
07:24 - that I believe 48 pixels so then when we
07:28 - have the border radius of 50% it becomes
07:31 - an oval instead of a circle so what I
07:34 - think we can do I think we're going to
07:39 - use a little bit of flex flex box to
07:44 - vertically align this and then we can
07:46 - change the height so just to kind of
07:48 - demonstrate why we need to do it like
07:50 - that and why we can't just change the
07:52 - height right away is that let's verify
07:58 - that it's still an oval no it's a circle
08:01 - so I need to make this and you shift
08:04 - this over there we go now we have the
08:07 - oval let me make this bigger so y'all
08:10 - can see
08:12 - and one more there we go
08:15 - okay so let's select this button div and
08:18 - I really want you know what let me move
08:25 - this down there we go and then let me
08:29 - move me up there we go now you should be
08:35 - able to see this hopefully it's not too
08:37 - small let me know if it is and so let's
08:42 - put the hover on all the time so we're
08:44 - going to activate this hover state here
08:46 - and so that'll stay hover it up here and
08:50 - let's zoom in so we can see if I bring
08:58 - the height back down to where it is it
09:00 - obviously fixes it but now this is no
09:02 - longer centered it's it's up at the top
09:03 - and I think it looks a lot nicer when
09:05 - it's centered there so I mean what we
09:08 - could do potentially is just like kind
09:10 - of manually set hey let's let's make it
09:13 - this many pixels from the top right we
09:16 - could do that and then use the same
09:19 - media query for that or we could just
09:22 - try to vertically align it within its
09:24 - container so I think the better solution
09:27 - which will work even if we end up
09:30 - changing the height of the container
09:33 - sorry if you hear my stomach growling I
09:37 - haven't eaten very much yet so I just I
09:42 - didn't plan well and I didn't bring food
09:44 - and I didn't have time to go get food so
09:49 - anyway like I'd rather do the flexbox
09:53 - vertical centering because that will be
09:58 - better if we change things later on so
10:02 - let's check out the code it looks like
10:04 - we have interesting alright so we we do
10:10 - have a margin up here on the header okay
10:15 - let's give us some more space here
10:23 - this way this actually might be a little
10:25 - bit more difficult because we don't our
10:28 - containing div does not go all the way
10:31 - up to the top we have we have this
10:35 - margin here or is that padding
10:38 - I think it's padding yeah yeah the green
10:44 - is padding all right let's see how it
10:53 - looks I don't think it's gonna work but
10:55 - I think it's worth a shot if not we may
10:57 - have to go to my alternate solution okay
11:09 - alright so using them what's already
11:11 - display flex wonderful let's see if we
11:15 - can use a line a line self let's see
11:21 - what we get
11:22 - okay so if we Center it see this is what
11:25 - I was afraid of we're centering it and
11:30 - we we're centering it based on a div
11:34 - that stops here so if we were to let's
11:43 - say get rid of this padding top the
11:46 - centering works and you know what I I
11:50 - think we can get rid of that padding on
11:52 - the top let's shift the screen down just
11:58 - to make sure that it still looks okay I
12:01 - think it looks fine without the padding
12:04 - and if we need to add anything we can
12:09 - deal with that at some point we can just
12:11 - change the height but I think that works
12:13 - so we need to go in to the components or
12:17 - the CSS files that are attached
12:19 - components we need to add a line let's
12:24 - go back down here we need to add a line
12:27 - self-center and then we also need to
12:30 - take that padding at top padding off of
12:32 - the header and I think that should fix
12:36 - it all right so let's go to our code now
12:43 - and fix this so it should be let me
12:48 - close this it should be in our layout
12:56 - let's check layout first see if that
13:00 - gives us that header component
13:05 - let's let's shrink this a bit area hmm
13:17 - maybe not
13:26 - yes we have the footer we have yeah okay
13:30 - he's an app bar yeah it should be an app
13:33 - bar let's check this out
13:41 - right so let's check out the classes now
13:43 - on app bar we have them up here so we're
13:49 - doing some inline and if I'm going too
13:51 - fast please feel free to to ask
13:54 - questions
13:54 - I'll definitely go back and slow down a
13:57 - bit so we have these styles that are
14:01 - JavaScript but they look like CSS and
14:04 - they're right here in our component
14:06 - which is nice because we have one place
14:08 - where we can edit everything it's very
14:10 - modular we could use this component
14:12 - elsewhere and you know the styles will
14:14 - stay the same but in this case you can
14:17 - see we have our app bar and which acts
14:19 - as a class right and then we have this
14:22 - padding top so let's just get rid of
14:24 - that and then we'll have what we need
14:28 - we'll have one half of what we need so
14:31 - we've gotten rid of that padding on the
14:33 - top and then let's sum this menu button
14:40 - this is where we've switched up the
14:43 - height here and set a new height at that
14:45 - breakpoint but we're just going to
14:49 - remove that so that way we no longer
14:52 - have that change of height on that
14:54 - element and then we're also gonna add
15:00 - that aligned self we need the camel case
15:07 - here because if we were to put that - in
15:12 - in JavaScript it's going to interpret
15:14 - that as like a math operator right it's
15:18 - gonna say it's it's a minus sign we
15:21 - don't want that but then we can put in
15:25 - quotation marks we can say Center and
15:30 - this should give us what we want in case
15:33 - I missed something so we're going to
15:34 - save that go back and I'm gonna refresh
15:39 - so it just gets rid of everything that
15:40 - we done in dev tools oops and I just
15:45 - realized that I my image over on the
15:49 - other side my video may have been
15:52 - blocking things let me
15:54 - oh no I think it was okay and only got
15:57 - blocked anything but anyway now all that
16:00 - has gotten rid of and we could see hey
16:02 - it looks fine it looks centered and it's
16:06 - still it's a circle and no no longer an
16:09 - oval let's verify that it still works on
16:12 - a smaller screen yep
16:14 - yeah it works we haven't messed anything
16:16 - up excellent and I think we ended up
16:19 - with a little bit less code than what we
16:22 - started with which is awesome
16:24 - always good thing all right great
16:29 - so that's the the first thing fixed and
16:32 - I'm just going to go ahead through the
16:33 - process of committing this change so
16:39 - let's do a get status right and I'm
16:43 - gonna move my image back down here for
16:49 - now so we can see we've changed that
16:55 - components that at bar J s component
16:57 - we've edited that that's what we wanted
17:00 - adds we're going to do a get add we put
17:03 - a dot that just adds everything if we
17:06 - had one only wanted to add a specific
17:09 - you know file or set of files we could
17:13 - list them out there but I just usually
17:15 - use the dot by default because most of
17:19 - the time I do want to commit everything
17:20 - that's there so now that's ready to be
17:24 - committed and I'm gonna do yarn CM for a
17:27 - particular project we have a little
17:29 - automated things set up to help us make
17:31 - a good commit message but if you don't
17:33 - have that set up in your project which
17:34 - much projects don't you could just type
17:37 - in git commit with the M flag and type
17:40 - in your commit message and that'll do
17:42 - the same thing so what we've done is
17:47 - where we fixed a bug okay and I'm gonna
17:50 - write a little description and fix it's
17:55 - a menu buses
18:00 - [Music]
18:05 - let's see menu button hovers
18:16 - when you think of me always always
18:26 - circular okay that works that really was
18:30 - what we set out to do right let me I
18:36 - don't think this affects any open issues
18:42 - no it doesn't okay now what's gonna run
18:47 - through Auto formatting everything based
18:50 - on our es lint rules and it's going to
18:53 - run our unit tests and our end-to-end
18:57 - tests and if everything passes then it
19:01 - will commit and we have some we're
19:05 - passing but we do have some warning so
19:06 - that may be the next thing that we fix
19:12 - because those warnings are ugly we want
19:15 - to want to get rid of them let me know
19:18 - on my screen it looks like the video and
19:21 - audio are out of sync let me know if it
19:23 - looks like that to you all
19:27 - all right great so this all work now I
19:30 - can do a git push and that one I'll be
19:34 - available at the github repo that's
19:36 - linked in the description okay great
19:41 - usually if you're committing things if
19:44 - you using it to track or any version
19:46 - control system you want to commit often
19:48 - because each time you commit it's like a
19:51 - save point right that you can always go
19:54 - back to so if you wait too long to
19:57 - commit you might reach a point where
20:01 - something messes up and if you had to
20:04 - revert you'd lose a lot of your work so
20:06 - if you know it only takes you know a
20:09 - minute or less to commit
20:12 - but it could potentially save you a lot
20:14 - of time okay so it looks like some of
20:24 - you are seeing a delay and some of you
20:26 - aren't all right the delays getting
20:29 - better now it still looks like it's a
20:32 - little bit off but it's definitely
20:35 - better than it was hmm okay I'm not
20:40 - gonna I'm not gonna worry about it now
20:41 - then because it's pretty close it was
20:43 - off I wonder if it was just off when I
20:45 - was running through all those tests
20:49 - anyway I'm gonna check my timer okay we
20:54 - got about 10 minutes so if you've asked
20:55 - any questions in the chat in about 10
20:57 - minutes I will get to those we're gonna
20:59 - move on now and let's deal with these
21:03 - errors so I'm gonna pull this up just so
21:06 - we can see them and let's pull this to
21:09 - the side for a second all right so what
21:14 - I like to go whenever you get error
21:15 - messages I find it's helpful to go all
21:18 - the way up to the top because often the
21:22 - top error message is usually easier to
21:25 - comprehend and that'll get you to the
21:27 - root of the problem sometimes if you fix
21:30 - that the later messages go away I'm
21:33 - sorry it's a warning message not an
21:34 - error so that's where we're gonna start
21:40 - so it says a failed prop type the prop
21:44 - on open is marked as required and
21:46 - swipeable drawer but its value is
21:48 - undefined okay so if you remember
21:51 - yesterday we switched over to that
21:53 - swipeable drawer component but we
21:58 - evidently didn't put the on open prop so
22:02 - I didn't realize that that was required
22:03 - so let's do that now so this should be
22:09 - in our drawer component let's close this
22:14 - out
22:17 - I can close this out yeah I don't need
22:25 - to save that we've gone through that
22:27 - already let's go to our components
22:33 - folder and we're gonna go to drawer a s
22:39 - and we'll scroll down here to where we
22:43 - have that swipeable drawer you see we
22:49 - have on close but we don't have on open
22:53 - so I'm not sure let's just try to put
23:03 - toggle drawer toggle drawer in here as
23:07 - what's gonna happen I don't know if
23:09 - that'll mess it up but we'll see maybe
23:13 - it'll make our errors go away the next
23:15 - time so definitely want to test this
23:18 - though okay
23:25 - all right everything looks fine looks
23:29 - like it's working
23:30 - let me refresh just to verify that our
23:33 - changes are there it should Auto refresh
23:36 - but doesn't hurt to be sure okay looks
23:42 - like everything's working so let's just
23:49 - run our tests and which tests were this
24:00 - it's where I end to end test let me see
24:05 - let's check our package.json and see
24:06 - what command will run our tests and and
24:14 - I think this right end-to-end test so
24:17 - let's go with e to e so let's run the e
24:23 - on e to e to run our test again and see
24:30 - if we get any errors or if we get
24:33 - different errors I'm ok with that
24:39 - all right wonderful you know what let's
24:43 - run our unit test as well just to be
24:46 - sure
24:59 - all right great so it looks like all our
25:01 - test paths
25:02 - oh there we go did we get Sun I guess I
25:07 - didn't notice those oh but we are
25:10 - getting different warnings so those
25:12 - warnings that we had before are not
25:14 - there so we did fix that the key
25:19 - keyboard focus provided to the class's
25:23 - property is not implemented in button
25:25 - base you can only override one of the
25:29 - falling root disabled focus visible all
25:34 - right let's search for this keyboard
25:36 - focus throughout our whole project and
25:39 - find out where it's at because we're not
25:41 - getting yeah it's not telling us where
25:44 - that is we can try to look at our
25:47 - console here and see if we get a message
25:51 - we are getting a message but it doesn't
25:53 - tell us where it's at either so let's go
25:56 - back into our code and we're gonna go
25:57 - here and this is Visual Studio code so
26:02 - if we click on that magnifying glass
26:04 - icon then we can search throughout our
26:08 - entire project so let's do that
26:10 - all right so in our inverted button
26:13 - component we have this keyboard focused
26:17 - mmm okay all right this makes sense now
26:27 - let's let's go to that inverted button
26:32 - component
26:43 - okay I was a little bit afraid this
26:45 - would happen so a while ago we wanted to
26:51 - create a different type of button so we
26:54 - took we went into node modules and we
26:57 - found the code for button that was that
27:04 - was being used by material UI so we took
27:06 - all that code we copied and pasted it
27:08 - and modified it directly and created
27:11 - this inverted button component what I
27:15 - was worried about was that the changes
27:18 - would break it it didn't break it but we
27:24 - are getting warnings so let's see what
27:30 - we need to do then keyboard focus
27:44 - all right so saying keyboard focused
27:48 - we're gonna do shadow
28:00 - focus visible alright maybe
28:18 - maybe we'll change it to focus visible
28:21 - and see if that that works
28:36 - so let's go with
28:43 - focus visible and let's make sure this
28:48 - is the only place where we've used it
28:50 - and it looks like yes these other places
28:54 - won't really matter they're just the
28:56 - names of classes we created we could
28:58 - have named them anything all right so
29:01 - I'm gonna save that if this is the only
29:03 - thing that I need to change for this
29:05 - still to work I'm gonna be surprised but
29:10 - let's run through and which tests where
29:13 - these
29:21 - well these came from our unit test all
29:23 - right so let's let's rerun our unit test
29:25 - see what we get now
29:38 - we could just check the console refresh
29:40 - the page but this way we can stay on the
29:44 - same screen there we go
29:46 - so now we've we've fixed that so you see
29:50 - we run your own unit and you know it's
29:52 - definitely the tests that are making the
29:55 - audio and video out of sync as I just
29:58 - looked over briefly and I could see
30:01 - what's out of sync
30:03 - okay cool so it looks like this works we
30:06 - can also verify over here cool so we're
30:15 - no longer getting that warning here
30:17 - either we could check the buttons yep
30:20 - the buttons you know they're working all
30:23 - these these buttons are these aren't
30:32 - using these ones are using the inverted
30:35 - button cool all right so that works
30:42 - let's see alright so I was just clicking
30:45 - just to see if we get anything happen
30:48 - when I clicked and nothing happened when
30:50 - we click or hover so I think I think
30:54 - that's good let's do a git add my timer
31:03 - is almost up so this would be the last
31:05 - thing we do before I go to the questions
31:08 - and
31:17 - all right so let's do another fix and
31:21 - what was the first thing that we did
31:27 - let's just say some say address
31:55 - Mornington console from A to E you I
31:56 - update this does affect an open issue I
32:02 - believe I created an issue for this so
32:05 - let's go over to our repo and check this
32:09 - issue
32:09 - so this is our repo open already to an
32:13 - old issue that's already fixed and this
32:17 - is the swipeable drawer error that we'd
32:19 - like to fix and that is issue 125 so
32:22 - we're gonna go back over here and we'll
32:25 - say yes it does affect an open issue and
32:27 - then we'll add a reference to issue 1 2
32:31 - 5 right and we'll press enter now to run
32:36 - through everything it all should work
32:38 - and then we'll push that up to github so
32:44 - I'm gonna set my timer now for 5 minutes
32:47 - and I'll answer questions for the next 5
32:50 - minutes let me get my there we go I
32:56 - couldn't see the chat for a second I'm
33:01 - gonna scroll all the left to the top so
33:03 - whoever asked the questions first your
33:05 - questions will be answered first if I
33:07 - can't answer
33:12 - David us what are the prerequisites
33:14 - before watching this dream anybody can
33:18 - watch the stream and if you don't know
33:20 - what's happening just ask questions I'll
33:22 - do my best to explain but really to get
33:24 - the most out of the stream it would be
33:26 - helpful if you had some knowledge of
33:28 - HTML CSS JavaScript if you really want
33:32 - to get a lot out of this stream if you
33:34 - have knowledge of react that would also
33:36 - be helpful so I like to make this as a
33:42 - beginner friendly as possible so I think
33:44 - depending on where you're at in terms of
33:47 - your experience level you will get
33:49 - different things out of this stream but
33:52 - hopefully everybody can get something
33:53 - out of it but you know that's that's
33:57 - gonna change so just know that no matter
33:59 - where you're at if you ever get confused
34:01 - just ask I'd be happy to go back over
34:04 - something that I had done and explain it
34:07 - in a little bit more detail and yeah
34:13 - some in certain streams are different
34:15 - some streams we just work with CSS some
34:19 - streams we work with sequel some streams
34:22 - we work with WordPress so you know there
34:27 - are some shoes who do really basic stuff
34:28 - and some where we do more complicated
34:30 - things so it kind of just depends on
34:32 - what we're doing as well in terms of
34:35 - like what you what background will help
34:37 - you the most
34:38 - alright I'm gonna do a git push there we
34:42 - go let's go back to the chat
34:55 - scrubs I guess that's how I'm
34:58 - pronouncing that says I'd suggest
35:01 - watching at any level it's good to see
35:03 - how things are done by other devs yeah
35:05 - yeah thanks for bringing that up I think
35:07 - that's a good thing that you know even
35:09 - if you don't exactly understand what's
35:10 - going on on the screen in terms of the
35:13 - code it it may be helpful just to see
35:16 - the process or you know just to hear the
35:20 - opinions of the other devs in the chat
35:23 - as well there's a lot of a lot of
35:25 - knowledge there Julio says use get
35:36 - integrated forget add and get and commit
35:39 - basic commands I've never I've never
35:42 - done that before I maybe have to check
35:45 - that out
35:50 - Nikki says use control B to toggle that
35:53 - sidebar menu on and off control B okay
35:56 - off to check that out let me try right
35:58 - now all right it's not working no all
36:08 - right it's not working for me let me see
36:10 - what there we go
36:14 - you know what I have the Adam keyboard
36:17 - shortcut setup so it's it's actually for
36:20 - me on a Mac command and then I don't
36:24 - know the slash that also has the pipe
36:26 - operator above him the I can't
36:30 - remember what's it for word and with the
36:31 - backslash but anyway that's why mine may
36:34 - be a bit different
36:35 - I always forget to use them Julio says
36:42 - is a good idea react for single page app
36:46 - or better I go with angular it really
36:49 - depends on what you're more comfortable
36:50 - with and if there's some specific
36:52 - feature of angular or react that you
36:55 - would like react works great is a single
36:59 - page app and actually even further as a
37:00 - progressive web app so if you use you
37:03 - know create react app it will be really
37:07 - it'll set you up to have a progressive
37:09 - web app pretty much right off the bat I
37:12 - don't know enough about angular to
37:15 - really make a recommendation for it
37:17 - though
37:21 - I hope hope we hope what I'm not it's
37:26 - hopw II says hey Jesse amazing stuff
37:30 - you've got here may I ask you what
37:33 - exactly does the json syntax to do i
37:36 - mean how are the commands define and
37:38 - everything okay so this uh this package
37:42 - JSON file it's it's for using NPM node
37:49 - package manager so basically it's just a
37:52 - set of descriptions and it tracks all
37:58 - the packages that your project uses so
38:01 - that if somebody else wants to to work
38:04 - on it they can download all the code
38:08 - without having to download all the node
38:09 - modules but then they have a record of
38:11 - which node modules are used and so they
38:13 - can just install those and NPM will
38:16 - automatically like it'll just read this
38:19 - it'll know what to install and you can
38:20 - get working and then in this scripts
38:23 - part of it you can just define kind of
38:28 - like little shortcuts to use so you can
38:31 - type in like npm dev and it'll do all
38:34 - this stuff so instead of typing all this
38:37 - out you just make this little shortcut
38:40 - dev and then it will run and you can
38:43 - make you know whatever you want for for
38:46 - all your shortcuts so that's kind of a
38:50 - really quick overview but hopefully that
38:53 - helps a little bit okay my timer went up
39:01 - again so I'm gonna go do some more code
39:02 - there's only one more question left
39:04 - though so this is priyanka asked which
39:08 - is better adams sublime or Visual Studio
39:11 - I've never used sublime I do like Adam
39:16 - but I have switched over to visual
39:17 - studio it seems a bit quicker
39:21 - so I definitely like it but I can't say
39:26 - anything about sublime because I've
39:27 - never used it though but I think you'd
39:30 - be fine going with any of them they're
39:32 - gonna they're gonna work well okay all
39:39 - right let's go back let's set this
39:41 - Pomodoro timer and let's see we can see
39:48 - now that this is referenced so that
39:54 - commit we just made as reference here
39:56 - I'm gonna close the issue because it's
40:00 - been fixed and if anybody checks out
40:02 - that issue you know they'll be able to
40:04 - see like this addressed it and they can
40:07 - go check out how how we fixed it
40:19 - all right let's go back and oh ok here's
40:27 - another thing so when we updated the
40:30 - padding around grid items was taken away
40:36 - so you can see here all these buttons
40:39 - are actually encased in the grid
40:44 - components so we need to put back some
40:48 - padding and add them in here so let's
40:50 - check that out let's go to our component
40:56 - so we have this hero component let's
41:01 - take out drawer here take this out too
41:05 - just to make some space
41:16 - there we go here Oh so hero is where we
41:21 - have these buttons so we've set up so
41:28 - that these buttons are actually like
41:29 - constants and we move them in and there
41:33 - they're optional so this is where the
41:35 - actual code is for the buttons so the
41:37 - primary button is the one on the top and
41:39 - then we have the two lower buttons here
41:41 - as our secondary and tertiary buttons
41:43 - and then you can see depending on what
41:45 - props are passed into the hero component
41:47 - we will display you know a certain
41:51 - number of buttons so what we want to do
41:55 - though is for these grid items we want
42:03 - to have some some spacing so let's try
42:09 - to put I'm not exactly sure which part
42:13 - of the grid needs the spacing needs to
42:15 - go on so let's try to put it on that top
42:16 - grid container and let's go spacing and
42:21 - we'll say equals let's try 16 at first
42:26 - okay so we're gonna give it a value of
42:29 - 16 and see what happens usually in
42:36 - material design you the values are like
42:38 - 8 you know 8 or 16 for padding is almost
42:42 - always what you get hey there we go all
42:47 - right so that ended up being an easy fix
42:49 - so basically what happened between the
42:51 - older version of material UI and this
42:53 - newer version is that they used to have
42:56 - by default I believe it was a spacing of
42:59 - 16 since it's 16 pixels but it was
43:02 - messing some things up so they decided
43:04 - to go with a default of no spacing and
43:07 - then if you want spacing you put it in
43:10 - so that definitely makes sense but if
43:14 - you were counting on that spacing before
43:17 - and now it's not there it messes it up
43:19 - but see now we have our spacing back
43:21 - this looks pretty much exactly like it
43:23 - did before as far as I can remember
43:27 - awesome that was an easy fix
43:32 - great let's go with I don't think I had
43:38 - an issue open for this yet but I guess
43:40 - it's worth it's a check yeah nothing
43:44 - nothing for that open so I'm going to
43:50 - take my own advice about get commits and
43:52 - we're gonna commit often I've been a
43:56 - little bit lazy about committing lately
43:57 - and I've just been making huge commits
44:00 - where I basically work all day and then
44:03 - commit at the end and that's not a good
44:05 - idea it almost I almost ruined a lot of
44:09 - work on my presentation for the talk
44:12 - that I gave over the weekend which if
44:14 - you check out my youtube channel you can
44:16 - watch the talk if you'd like but my
44:20 - presentation I almost like lost
44:22 - everything because I didn't commit and
44:25 - so now I'm going to try to commit more
44:28 - often it's one of those things that you
44:31 - always know you should do but sometimes
44:33 - you just get lazy with it so let's do it
44:35 - get status it's always nice to get
44:38 - status just to verify what you've done
44:40 - has actually been done and nothing you
44:45 - haven't inadvertently changed a file
44:48 - that you didn't realize that you changed
44:50 - so we'll do a git add yarn cm and let's
44:59 - say fix and I'm just going to do a hero
45:04 - button spacing
45:11 - all right and that should all pass
45:13 - through all the tests I mean we've
45:14 - really only changed such a small amount
45:17 - it should be fine
45:18 - and while that's going let's go back in
45:24 - here and see what else we have going on
45:27 - I know of one other issue that we could
45:31 - work on but while we're on this page we
45:34 - may as well check these look fine it's
45:41 - actually something I've been meaning to
45:42 - do as well like right now we have these
45:45 - cards and their YouTube videos and you
45:48 - click them they play automatically which
45:50 - is really nice but I don't like loading
45:55 - the YouTube videos on the home page
45:57 - because it actually slows down the load
45:59 - time so I would like to come up with
46:03 - some sort of solution where we could
46:04 - still have a very similar functionality
46:06 - but not have to actually load the
46:08 - YouTube video so I'm okay with some sort
46:11 - of lazy loading or you know perhaps we
46:16 - don't actually load it until this is
46:19 - clicked on so we could kind of make our
46:22 - own play button when you click it and
46:25 - then it Auto plays the video
46:27 - it loads and auto plays there'll be a
46:29 - little bit more delay when you're
46:30 - actually trying to play the video but
46:32 - many users may not even try to click the
46:35 - video so we'll see we'll see how it goes
46:41 - but I definitely I don't want to remove
46:43 - all the videos because I think it's nice
46:45 - to have them right there but we got to
46:47 - do something so that we don't mess up
46:49 - our load times trying to load in all
46:53 - that iframe stuff for the videos all
46:58 - right so I'd like to go to the English
47:04 - faculty page
47:10 - oh no you know what our our snapshot
47:19 - failed because it's it changed so we're
47:23 - doing our unit tests it automatically
47:25 - makes snapshots and we didn't update our
47:27 - snapshot after we we ran that so let's
47:30 - go ahead and update that snapshot now
47:37 - okay great so now that we've done that
47:40 - we can go back and run this yarn cm with
47:45 - the retry flag so now it should just go
47:53 - back in and it should work this time
47:55 - we'll check in on it in a second oh okay
48:06 - so we actually have problem here all
48:11 - right it says to lower case is undefined
48:26 - see if we can figure out where this
48:28 - issue is what is this the faculty list
48:32 - pages I think I know what the problem is
48:36 - did we get an error again
48:53 - is this it's still showing the air with
48:56 - that test
49:07 - all right for some reason our snapshot
49:11 - didn't update so what we can do to fix
49:15 - that is go into our snapshots and check
49:19 - out we can see this snapshot is the one
49:23 - that's not working we can delete the
49:25 - snapshot and then run this again and
49:31 - that should create the snapshot properly
49:34 - this time so let's try that and while
49:38 - that's running let's go to that page
49:41 - where we're getting the air and that's
49:43 - the faculty list page be sure if you
49:51 - have to go in and delete your unit
49:54 - snapshot that you actually delete the
49:56 - snapshot and not the unit test itself
49:59 - they have the same name except for the
50:02 - stuff snapshot at the end so I've done
50:05 - this multiple times where I've
50:06 - accidentally deleted the entire unit
50:08 - test in and that's kind of like it's a
50:13 - pain I can do I can just go into github
50:15 - a copy and paste the unit test I guess I
50:19 - could go into the trash or recycle bin
50:21 - and restore but it is just kind of a
50:23 - pain so we can see that that work now so
50:26 - it created a new snapshot and you know
50:31 - occasionally I have to do that it's
50:34 - pretty rare though all right so let's
50:37 - see what else has changed so we do want
50:41 - to commit that snapshot so we're gonna
50:43 - do a git add as well before we run this
50:48 - you are in cm retry
50:54 - so if we just would have run the rnc em
50:57 - retry without committing that snapshot
51:00 - then what could happen is somebody who's
51:03 - trying to pull that that update would
51:08 - then get the same error that we just did
51:10 - with our snapshots right so we want to
51:14 - make sure we commit it commit them both
51:16 - all right so that's their push that to
51:21 - github now in this faculty list here's
51:24 - what I think is happening let's see if
51:26 - it's if it's the case I think maybe our
51:31 - imports are not we're not importing
51:33 - things properly or potentially something
51:38 - that were like below in the child
51:41 - components maybe is not being imported
51:43 - properly so first we're gonna check here
51:47 - in the faculty list and I'm just going
51:49 - to glance through this and see I'm
51:51 - looking for anything that we're
51:52 - importing from material I was okay so
52:03 - it's not here so I'm guessing it's in
52:05 - this faculty list item component so
52:07 - let's grab that component shut our test
52:10 - folder so let's check the faculty list
52:14 - item component and here we go I think
52:16 - this is our issue so in the latest
52:20 - version of material I we don't import
52:22 - things all together in one line like
52:24 - this we would import them all separately
52:26 - so here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna
52:31 - grab these and I'm gonna copy and paste
52:36 - these and let's get rid of these and get
52:48 - ready
52:51 - and for this one we're just going to
52:54 - grab the card right and then for this
52:58 - one we're gonna grab card actions and
53:01 - then for this one we're gonna say card
53:04 - content and then now we can say actions
53:11 - content alright so that way that was
53:14 - pretty quick and it looks like we're not
53:16 - actually even using card so let's get
53:18 - rid of that we can tell from this wiggly
53:19 - line it's gonna say that it's defined in
53:21 - every use so let's get rid of that but
53:24 - now we can see that instead of importing
53:26 - all these together from card the the
53:28 - file card we're going to import card
53:34 - actions from card actions we're going to
53:36 - import card content from card content so
53:39 - they're all separated out now let's make
53:42 - sure we're not doing the same thing now
53:45 - it looks it looks good so let's save
53:49 - that and if I was right which I'm not
53:53 - very often but if I was right then the
53:55 - error should be gone so let's check it
53:57 - out yay air is gone all right cool the
54:04 - only reason that I was able to figure
54:06 - that out so quickly is because we we
54:08 - dealt with or at least i yesterday
54:10 - before i streamed spent a long time
54:13 - dealing with very similar errors so it
54:16 - was still fresh in my mind and I knew
54:19 - what that meant
54:19 - if I had probably gotten that error you
54:21 - know a week later I may not have
54:24 - remembered it all right so now that's
54:27 - great we fixed that error so we probably
54:31 - should commit that but what I really
54:33 - wanted to show you all is this we have
54:41 - this iframe that's coming through and
54:46 - we're seeing the code and not the actual
54:48 - iframe so we need to check out see
54:53 - what's going on here why is the video
54:55 - not displaying and why are we getting
54:56 - the code there what I suspect is that
54:58 - I'm I'm not bringing in the the content
55:04 - like as HTML so we'll check in in that
55:10 - this will be our faculty je s component
55:14 - in the pages folder so we'll check that
55:17 - in just a second but let's commit our
55:20 - fix that we did here get status let's do
55:25 - a git add and a yarn cm and let's say to
55:34 - fix and we're gonna fix fix imports
55:44 - we're gonna fix no nope there we go so
56:00 - it may be worthwhile to bill and check
56:03 - all the imports and all of our
56:05 - components I thought I had already taken
56:08 - care of them all evidently I didn't so
56:12 - while it's still fresh in my mind that
56:14 - might be a good thing to do I don't know
56:16 - if I'll do that on the stream it's just
56:18 - gonna be kind of repetitive and not
56:20 - probably not very educational all right
56:23 - wonderful get push all right so let's
56:32 - get get this out of here
56:33 - and let's get this out of here we've
56:35 - already done our work there and let's
56:38 - find that faculty is
56:47 - so here's all their pages so a faculty
56:51 - died Jas page and here we go so we're in
56:56 - our render method here and interesting
57:02 - okay let me check that again let's let's
57:13 - look up with the mark-up actually is
57:15 - here video embed oh I see
57:22 - interesting all right here's what's
57:25 - happening this is being brought in with
57:32 - with quotation marks around it let's go
57:37 - over to our wordpress installation and
57:40 - see what data is there I want to see
57:43 - where those quotation marks are being
57:44 - added in so go to WP Franciscan
57:51 - University this is where WordPress
57:53 - installation is right now great I was
57:57 - already logged in so that's awesome and
58:00 - we need to find faculty so you want to
58:05 - go in here to faculty and find our
58:15 - English faculty there we go
58:26 - all right so there we go that's it
58:32 - so in our actual code we have these
58:38 - quotation marks I think no no we don't
58:46 - why is it like this all right let's do
58:49 - some editing of the code here and see if
58:51 - we can get the video to appear properly
59:09 - hmm okay all right
59:15 - so I'm hoping that this will will make
59:18 - it work now unfortunately what I'll have
59:21 - to do is maybe get somebody in here to
59:26 - like a student worker to manually make
59:28 - these changes or we could come up with
59:32 - some way to change that programmatically
59:36 - within our component now that I will
59:39 - have some students working on this I'm a
59:41 - little bit more open tech to manually
59:46 - editing this data okay
59:49 - let's go back here and refresh see what
59:54 - we get
60:01 - interesting
60:13 - oh I see
60:19 - I check this out within our component
60:23 - we're searching for anything with this
60:25 - source attribute and we're replacing it
60:28 - we're adding this we're prepending this
60:30 - franciscan dot e-d-u
60:32 - we need to do this for images but we
60:37 - don't want to do this for iframes so
60:40 - this is going to be this is going to be
60:46 - interesting
60:52 - let me know what you all think yeah let
60:59 - me see okay so here's our problem and
61:03 - I'd like your advice on the solution
61:06 - here so the problem is we do need to
61:09 - replace some of not replace we need to
61:15 - prepend
61:16 - a URL onto these source attributes for
61:19 - images but we don't want to do that for
61:22 - iframes so what would be the best way to
61:28 - do that
61:45 - I'm thinking maybe a regular expression
61:48 - but this is going to be another instance
61:50 - where my regular expression skills are
61:53 - not good enough to make this happen
61:56 - without without some research
62:08 - hmm
62:12 - all right let me look and see what would
62:15 - you all think Johnny instance says do a
62:20 - ternary true do this use video element
62:25 - Johnny instance since yes regex needed
62:28 - yeah you know what maybe trying to think
62:34 - about how to create the issues so that
62:36 - it'll make sense off to think about how
62:38 - to explain this in an issue
62:40 - I'll make the issue if anybody is good
62:43 - with regex and wants to try it out
62:45 - you'll feel free otherwise at least I
62:48 - will remember what the issue is and then
62:51 - I can spend some time researching
62:54 - regular expressions to see how I could
62:57 - fix this problem I don't really want to
63:01 - do research on the stream it's just not
63:06 - not very exciting watching me read
63:07 - things
63:19 - I wonder if we can take what we're doing
63:22 - with a CV link and just adapt it
63:34 - actually let's do it still it's it's
63:38 - worth a try let's just edit this see if
63:45 - we can get it to work
63:46 - okay so instead of CV link what we're
63:49 - looking for then is iframe and instead
63:53 - of a href we're just looking for mmm
64:19 - that's what we're looking for maybe we
64:22 - can get rid of this
64:42 - we don't need this all right now we just
64:50 - need to let me change this iframe regex
65:28 - all right well the problem though is we
65:33 - still have that replace happening you
65:39 - know what maybe we'll have to yeah well
65:48 - um we're gonna have to do another
65:50 - regular expression for where we're
65:53 - getting the image thing and actually my
65:55 - timer just went up so let me take a
65:58 - break and go back to the chat answer
65:59 - some more questions and then let me know
66:02 - what you all want if you think the
66:03 - streams already gone on long enough
66:04 - we'll stop here or if you really want to
66:07 - see if we can fix this then I all extend
66:10 - it a bit longer and we'll see if we can
66:13 - fix it
66:34 - okay Nikki made a good point earlier
66:37 - when we were talking about different
66:39 - editors so saying visual studio does not
66:42 - equal visual studio code so yeah I think
66:45 - a lot of times were just kind of talking
66:47 - you shorten it and say visual studio
66:50 - instead of visual studio code I like to
66:52 - say vs code it just seems faster but
66:57 - yeah visual studio is a much bigger
67:00 - program much more powerful but overkill
67:05 - for what we do
67:06 - vs code is very similar to things like
67:12 - atom or sublime it's built with electron
67:16 - so yeah definitely a different thing for
67:23 - Janka says could you please tell me how
67:26 - to get an internship after two years my
67:30 - graduation is it possible I tell you
67:37 - that I'm not sure I've never you know
67:39 - pursued an internship but there are
67:41 - internship opportunities out there if
67:46 - we're gonna look for internship
67:48 - opportunities you know after graduating
67:50 - I would to be honest with you I do a
67:54 - little Google search first I'm guessing
67:58 - that you've already done that so I'm
68:01 - sorry that's probably not very helpful
68:02 - but I I don't have experience with that
68:05 - if anybody else has experience with
68:08 - getting internships after you've already
68:10 - been in college please let let Priyanka
68:35 - mad Duchess says does it work to add the
68:39 - snapshots and unit tests into another
68:41 - folder for easier management or does
68:44 - that affect performance I mean I guess
68:51 - you could add them into another folder I
68:53 - don't know if it would hurt the
68:55 - performance okay sorry Nikki all right
69:01 - now I see what you're saying
69:03 - okay sorry so yeah we we do have the
69:06 - tests separated out so alright we have
69:09 - our test folder and then within the test
69:11 - folder we have the snapshots folder so
69:14 - they are separated like that but the
69:16 - problem is like when you have them both
69:17 - open or like if I have it closed and I
69:21 - just go in and say like alright I'm
69:22 - gonna remove my snapshot sometimes I
69:24 - accidentally remove the wrong one it
69:29 - happens
69:36 - Nikki asked with the Google doodle for
69:39 - today is Michael says this dr. Virginia
69:46 - apgar's 109 day cool
69:50 - I don't I don't know who dr. Virginia
69:52 - Apgar is but maybe I should know
69:56 - let's check it out cool
70:15 - it's app car like the score they give
70:18 - babies I think it is now it's coming
70:26 - back to me since I've had fork kids
70:29 - should know this cool uh yeah I'd love
70:36 - to find out more about that
70:51 - okay yeah it is the the Apgar test cool
70:58 - for babies
71:11 - okay so Carlos is saying in regard to
71:15 - the regular expression stuff you say
71:21 - maybe adapt another constant as like CV
71:25 - regex but for the videos okay so that's
71:27 - what we're doing and pull it on the
71:30 - replace method
71:32 - Charbel Sarkis is how do you select the
71:34 - same occurrence of the text twice and
71:36 - edit at the same time replace after it
71:40 - do a replace after the last replace if
71:44 - the regex doesn't match and nothing is
71:46 - going to change okay let's see
72:05 - hmm
72:44 - yeah I don't think all right well let's
72:47 - just let's just do this and see if what
72:50 - I think is going to happen will happen
72:52 - which is we're not gonna it's not gonna
72:56 - do what we want it to do but let's just
72:58 - give it a shot you know the iframe here
73:02 - and then let me grab
73:12 - describe this
73:22 - and then what we want to do is for this
73:30 - source we're gonna put in h2 or I'm
73:39 - sorry not h2 because we're gonna want
73:46 - yeah whatever's after that and then here
73:52 - okay
74:04 - we actually
74:19 - yeah I can I can bring this down even
74:22 - further
74:24 - okay it's still gonna be the second one
74:29 - okay
74:32 - and just to to make sure this is going
74:38 - all right let's just add that in so
74:47 - we'll know if it worked
75:17 - you're fresh
75:23 - and let's see
75:44 - okay it looks like this it did not work
75:53 - so our replace here did not work
76:12 - maybe that messed it up
76:29 - try again
76:47 - he
76:51 - that didn't work either
77:21 - alright let's add in
78:00 - it's not gonna work including today
78:17 - all right still not working
78:27 - let me see
78:38 - okay John Hanson says you may be able to
78:41 - write the ternary into the same argument
78:43 - where you replace the URL for the
78:45 - University since it's already finding
78:46 - that
78:58 - Julio is asking about I is on 2018 I'm
79:05 - not I'm not sure where you're asking
79:08 - we're not using is okay let's check this
79:19 - out
79:26 - okay so we're trying to find the source
79:28 - here
79:39 - the problem with putting the turn area
79:42 - in here is that I'm not grabbing
79:44 - anything other than that SRC so there's
79:47 - there's nothing for me to say like if I
79:53 - mean maybe
80:05 - yeah I'm not sure about the ternary I
80:10 - think it would have to be a regex thing
80:12 - again like we look grab ngosource
80:16 - [Music]
80:18 - but we're not gonna grab it if it has
80:21 - the word youtube in it or something like
80:23 - that
80:45 - I wonder
80:53 - what if we can do this I wonder if
80:59 - that'll work
81:09 - ah no
81:18 - what did I do
81:37 - all right this works but unfortunately
81:40 - it'll get rid of any anything in that
81:43 - image sag
81:55 - all right let me get rid of this then
81:59 - and we're rid of this all right let me
82:07 - explain why did this did so instead of
82:09 - just looking for the source attribute I
82:11 - said like okay I'm gonna look for you
82:13 - know image with source attribute which
82:19 - works but it'll also rewrite like if
82:23 - there were other attributes so let's
82:25 - just let's check it out and see if there
82:27 - even were other attributes in this case
82:30 - no there weren't all it's just the alt
82:34 - attribute was missing actually you know
82:46 - what I think there's a better way to do
82:47 - this and still keep our alt attributes
82:50 - or whatever attributes we have so let's
82:52 - do this we're gonna make it cost and
82:57 - we're gonna say this is the image reg X
83:00 - and let's create we're gonna get rid of
83:07 - the CV link stuff
83:14 - we're going to get rid of it here we're
83:18 - gonna replace this a tag with image and
83:25 - image F so that's gonna be all the stuff
83:30 - inside the href and then actually we're
83:40 - not gonna have an ending image tag right
83:42 - no we won't
83:47 - what we'll have then it's just this
83:52 - we're not gonna need this so this will
84:00 - be our href and then this will be all
84:05 - the other attributes at the end so then
84:08 - we go down here and we can say we're
84:15 - gonna replace this all with get rid of
84:19 - CV link get rid of CV link let's add an
84:24 - image I add in our image tag we'll place
84:30 - this href with the source the second
84:37 - section there is what we want for our
84:40 - source and then we're not gonna add in
84:47 - our other stuff here instead we're gonna
84:49 - put in we're just gonna grab whatever
84:51 - else is there which would be four so
84:57 - we're gonna say this is going to be four
85:01 - and then we don't want any of this we
85:09 - want that and then we can remove whoops
85:17 - almost forget that so we want to combine
85:23 - the
85:24 - in here hopefully that space won't mess
85:28 - it up mmm yeah let's leave it like that
85:37 - okay and we will get rid of this for now
85:45 - or let's just comment it out for now
85:49 - okay now let's see if that works
85:53 - no I what did we get the image source
86:01 - [Music]
86:08 - okay not too bad we didn't get what
86:12 - exactly what we wanted though but
86:22 - or maybe we didn't get anything maybe it
86:25 - didn't work at all yeah you know what it
86:28 - didn't work because we look for the
86:29 - wrong thing Oh someone noticed there is
86:41 - an extra okay yep
86:48 - good luck Nikki
87:00 - dang
87:06 - it's not working
87:16 - mmm
87:24 - I'm messing up something in this regular
87:28 - expression for the image so it's not
87:29 - actually getting oops sorry see all
87:35 - right let's try it now yes all right see
87:44 - an image source that works and then it
87:48 - also has the oh yes all right awesome
87:51 - so that worked okay cool the only thing
87:58 - I'm thinking that maybe might not work
88:03 - exactly right is if in the markup
88:06 - they've put a lot of attributes before
88:07 - the source in that case it's not that it
88:12 - won't work it's just that those Astra
88:14 - buttes might not actually get added in
88:15 - at the end but for now this works and it
88:20 - does preserve anything after which is
88:22 - definitely better than what we had
88:24 - before
88:24 - and our videos now work so that's pretty
88:31 - awesome I think it's awesome all right
88:39 - John said you made it look so easy I
88:42 - don't know how I just did that sometimes
88:45 - like you know what it's just it you just
88:47 - get this light bulb in your you know a
88:49 - moment where it's like I I have it
88:53 - occasionally that happens I think I just
88:56 - got like in the zone you know and it's
88:58 - just my brain was just working I don't
89:00 - even know why because I'm starving right
89:02 - now I was about to give up cuz I was
89:06 - just so hungry and I was thinking like I
89:08 - can't even think but alright I guess I'm
89:12 - okay under pressure then Carlos says yay
89:16 - don't know what you did but awesome good
89:18 - coding all right cool yeah so let me
89:20 - take just a second to explain what I did
89:23 - as best I can and then then we'll finish
89:29 - up any questions with any questions you
89:31 - have and we'll all in the stream okay so
89:33 - here's what I did basically so we quit
89:35 - using this
89:36 - just get rid of that right so we made
89:42 - this regular expression which all it's
89:44 - doing is just searching for something
89:47 - right so this whole constant is just a
89:51 - search and we've just given it certain
89:53 - parameters so that it searches for and
89:56 - finds exactly what we want so what I'm
89:58 - searching for is this particular string
90:02 - which is like the beginning of an image
90:05 - tag but I want to find the image tag
90:08 - that also has a source equals in it with
90:13 - a what am I thinking for with a
90:19 - quotation mark right with a double quote
90:21 - at the beginning right so assuming it
90:24 - finds that then what it's going to do is
90:27 - it's going to save whatever comes
90:30 - between the first quote the second quote
90:33 - as a variable and we're going to be able
90:37 - to access that variable by using dollar
90:39 - sign to write that's the second thing in
90:42 - there I'm not sure if this is proper of
90:44 - regex terminology but this is how I'm
90:46 - explaining I'm understanding it from
90:48 - JavaScript world okay so now everything
90:53 - that's in that source attribute gets
90:55 - saved for us and then everything after
90:58 - the source attribute but before the
91:00 - ending tag in the image tag will get
91:02 - saved as this other variable that we're
91:05 - going to be able to access as dollar
91:07 - sign for because it's the one two three
91:10 - fourth set of parentheses here then
91:15 - basically we're finding that ending to
91:20 - this and so altogether with this regular
91:24 - expression we're getting an entire image
91:26 - tag and this is going to say we want to
91:31 - search globally I believe so correct me
91:34 - if I'm wrong with this so this is global
91:35 - so we're going to find every occurrence
91:37 - of this not just the first occurrence
91:39 - and then we want it to be case
91:41 - insensitive so just in case you know
91:44 - somebody decides to make the image tag
91:46 - capitalized it still should work right
91:49 - now when we go down here we're getting
91:52 - all that content that we're grabbing
91:54 - from WordPress so everything that we see
91:58 - here we're getting all that content and
92:02 - then we are replacing parts of it so
92:05 - once we get down to this replace we're
92:08 - going to search so the first parameter
92:10 - of that replace is a search for that
92:15 - regular expression so we're searching
92:17 - for any of those image tags right but
92:21 - then we want to replace that entire
92:23 - image tag with the second parameter and
92:26 - so the second parameter is an image tag
92:29 - but we're adding in this Franciscan edu
92:33 - URL because that's where that image
92:35 - lives right so in order to grab the
92:37 - image we need that and then we're just
92:39 - adding in whatever was the in there
92:43 - originally right that dollar sign too
92:45 - and then we're just tacking on any other
92:48 - attributes like an alt tag or a title
92:51 - tag that may have been a part of that
92:53 - image and then we're closing our image
92:55 - tag all right so basically it's a find
92:58 - and replace but we're just doing some
93:00 - fancy stuff with the find does that make
93:04 - sense
93:13 - Aniki says go to another one of those
93:15 - pages is the iframe also enclosed by
93:17 - quotes there oh you know what that's a
93:19 - good that's a good idea we did manually
93:24 - edit some of that so that the iframe was
93:27 - enclosed in quotes yeah so potentially
93:38 - potentially we we could programmatically
93:42 - do that I'm gonna and I'm gonna just
93:44 - kind of stop with that now and then I'll
93:47 - look through a few other ones and see if
93:49 - we come upon that issue again I'll
93:54 - either manually change it or I'll add
93:56 - another one of these regular expressions
93:59 - for that particular scenario where we
94:03 - have the iframe within quotations
94:10 - so yeah but you're right that that may
94:15 - be an issue
94:17 - Matt Dutchess says thanks for making
94:21 - regex
94:22 - less scary and breaking it down for us
94:24 - oh yeah no problem
94:26 - it's still scary for me I just when I
94:29 - need it to work that's the only time I
94:33 - use it I guess and and really you know
94:35 - we had a pull request that gave us this
94:37 - you know I didn't come up with this but
94:40 - then after seeing this example I was
94:43 - able to understand what it did and then
94:46 - was able to do this based on that so
94:49 - when it comes to regular expressions I
94:51 - think that's the best if I see an
94:53 - example I can usually edit it right but
95:00 - if I try to come up with a regular
95:01 - expression completely on my own it's
95:04 - rough it's really hard so maybe that's a
95:07 - good way to approach regular expressions
95:09 - try to find something that's doing
95:11 - something similar to what you want and
95:14 - then maybe make make a few edits it
95:17 - could be a nice shortcut to get to where
95:20 - you need to go alright my I may as well
95:25 - start the process of
95:26 - this change while I'm doing questions so
95:28 - let's get started get status yep
95:31 - get a yarn see em fix so what are you
95:42 - going to fix I have video faculty pages
95:54 - yep there we go that's cool that's
96:02 - definitely something I didn't think I'd
96:03 - be able to fix during the stream so well
96:08 - that's the one it's thing let me finish
96:11 - up with some of these questions and then
96:13 - I might leave and get something to eat I
96:17 - might finish up my workday from home
96:19 - because I'm so hungry
96:22 - and it's so tough when you're on a diet
96:25 - you can't just like find whatever and
96:27 - just scavenge it you know although I
96:32 - tell you what like right now it's taking
96:33 - a lot of my willpower to not just eat
96:35 - like whatever the next thing is edible
96:37 - that I could find
96:47 - michael creo says you have four kids and
96:50 - don't know the Apgar test what once I
96:52 - saw the baby in the thing like it kind
96:55 - of like refresh my memory about Apgar
96:57 - but well my youngest is a year and a
97:01 - half old now so it's been a year and a
97:04 - half since I've probably even heard that
97:05 - and to be honest with you when my
97:07 - youngest was born my wife had a lot of
97:11 - problems and had to have a lot of
97:13 - doctor's appointments and surgeries so
97:15 - that I like took a lot of time off of
97:18 - work and drove her around all her stuff
97:20 - and took care of the kids so that's kind
97:23 - of like all blur and so I was much less
97:26 - worried about Cordelia my youngest then
97:29 - I was about my wife so anyway that's
97:34 - probably why I don't remember
97:55 - someone asked about my visual studio
97:56 - code theme and Nicki says it's it is
98:00 - SETI
98:00 - so yeah SETI is the theme that I'm using
98:03 - I've been using this for years and years
98:06 - like even back when I started with Adam
98:08 - which was I don't know like for at least
98:12 - four years ago I think it was I was
98:15 - started using Adam like really early on
98:18 - so not too long after it was first first
98:22 - came out so I've been using this theme
98:25 - for ever
98:31 - Michael Creole says is the a.href search
98:36 - hard-coded because not all CV link start
98:40 - with the href that was messing with me
98:44 - let me think
98:56 - you know what I haven't really tested
98:58 - this a lot to make sure it works
99:00 - everywhere but it should work so if the
99:05 - it doesn't necessarily have to start
99:07 - with href I believe that as long as href
99:11 - is contained somewhere it will still
99:14 - work I think that's what this period is
99:17 - going in here
99:17 - but I'm not a higher percent sure that
99:19 - was just my assumption otherwise we
99:22 - could have just taken this period out
99:24 - and left a space in and it would work
99:39 - okay yeah that's it so I need there were
99:44 - no other questions there in the chat
99:46 - thank you all so much for hanging in
99:48 - here with me for so long oh okay
99:53 - also asking about the font it's the fire
99:56 - or fear of font for Visual Studio code
100:01 - so Fira so search for the search for
100:05 - that font for Visual Studio code and
100:08 - should be able to get that it has the it
100:12 - does cool stuff like so when you do an
100:15 - arrow function it combines it right so
100:18 - it does some stuff like that alright so
100:23 - I'm gonna end the stream and get
100:25 - something to eat before I fall over here
100:27 - and yeah tomorrow it's a Friday already
100:33 - wow this week he's just gone so so
100:36 - quickly anyway yeah I'll try to do a
100:39 - stream tomorrow and not sure what we'll
100:44 - be working on we'll see maybe we'll find
100:46 - some more problems and fix those
100:48 - tomorrow but thanks again for watching
100:52 - and until tomorrow have a wonderful day
