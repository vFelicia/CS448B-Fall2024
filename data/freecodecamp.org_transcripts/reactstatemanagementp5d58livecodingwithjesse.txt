00:05 - hey everyone
00:07 - uh welcome to live coding with jesse
00:11 - and today we're going to work with state
00:14 - and react
00:17 - and um
00:19 - let me
00:20 - fix this screen for you
00:22 - if you remember yesterday uh i had some
00:25 - different monitors hooked up to this
00:26 - laptop so
00:28 - uh it shifted around the screen and um
00:31 - so last few minutes i've just been
00:32 - trying to get everything back to normal
00:35 - uh so
00:37 - happy friday
00:39 - it's crazy the week's already over uh i
00:42 - got off to a late start today i had my
00:44 - uh
00:45 - my youngest son ambrose who's three
00:48 - he's been having trouble swallowing and
00:50 - been getting things like stuck in his
00:51 - throat so we went in for some testing
00:53 - this morning at a hospital and he wanted
00:55 - me to go
00:56 - uh so
00:58 - uh i went in with him and uh he did a
01:01 - great job
01:02 - um
01:03 - all the nurses said it
01:06 - he did better than uh
01:08 - than the the uh grown men that were in
01:10 - there before him so i was proud of that
01:12 - little guy so i took him out to
01:14 - mcdonald's afterwards so
01:16 - uh anyway enough about me
01:20 - uh but anyway i just meant to say i got
01:22 - off to a really late start today because
01:23 - of that so i haven't had gotten to do
01:25 - that much with the project so it's
01:28 - pretty much in the same state that it
01:29 - was in
01:30 - yesterday uh
01:33 - so most of my work has just been in
01:35 - transferring data from the old database
01:37 - to the new database
01:39 - which you know all that is kind of
01:41 - behind the scenes and nobody really sees
01:42 - that
01:45 - um let me
01:49 - i want to move the chat window over to
01:52 - my other screen so that
01:55 - i can see it more easily and i don't
01:57 - miss your comments
02:00 - let's see and uh so
02:02 - there was a live stream about
02:04 - the free code camp youtube channel on
02:07 - another youtube channel called
02:09 - engineered truth
02:11 - i think that's what it was engineer
02:12 - truth
02:15 - i'm pretty sure that was the name of the
02:17 - channel
02:18 - but anyway it
02:20 - i should have grabbed the url for you
02:22 - all i don't have it right now
02:23 - uh but it was a pretty cool live stream
02:25 - it was quincy who if if you're not
02:27 - familiar with free code cam quincy is
02:29 - the founder and the head of free code
02:31 - camp uh but quincy uh was talking with
02:34 - another youtuber whose channel is very
02:36 - successful uh and this other youtuber
02:39 - was giving quincy a lot of advice
02:41 - on um
02:42 - how to make the free codecamp youtube
02:44 - channel better
02:46 - uh so it was pretty cool but it so if
02:48 - you have your own channel and you want
02:50 - some advice on
02:52 - on how to grow your channel
02:54 - definitely check that video out i mean
02:57 - a lot of the advice is not specific to
02:59 - free code camping could definitely be
03:01 - applied
03:02 - to a lot of different
03:04 - uh different types of of channels
03:06 - different content but especially if you
03:08 - have a channel about about tech or
03:11 - coding
03:12 - check that out
03:14 - so that was
03:15 - that was really cool
03:17 - and um
03:19 - of course it was cool to
03:21 - see my videos on the screen there uh in
03:24 - the live stream
03:26 - uh when quincy was showing like the
03:29 - youtube dashboard behind the scenes and
03:33 - so
03:34 - anyway that was cool i may be trying to
03:37 - incorporate some new things into my
03:39 - streams uh i'm going to try to maybe
03:42 - name them
03:43 - my streams like a little bit better so
03:46 - there's not going to be any major major
03:48 - changes for me
03:49 - uh but
03:51 - you know maybe just some some really
03:54 - like you know subtle things
03:56 - okay
03:57 - so it looks like
04:00 - yeah all right so we have a decent uh
04:03 - amount of viewers in here right now so i
04:05 - think we're safe to uh to get started
04:09 - so i figured today we'll do two pomodoro
04:11 - sessions
04:12 - uh so those are two 25-minute periods of
04:15 - code
04:17 - and in between those periods of code
04:20 - i'll answer some questions in the live
04:21 - chat
04:22 - so if you have any questions feel free
04:24 - to put in the live chat i won't probably
04:26 - won't get to your question immediately
04:29 - but
04:30 - i will answer it before the stream is
04:33 - over
04:35 - um so
04:39 - i uh
04:41 - i'm sorry i'm distracted by messages
04:43 - coming in so
04:46 - uh just
04:47 - for the new people in here for those of
04:49 - you who are seeing the stream a lot
04:50 - sorry i'm going to go over this again
04:51 - but uh at least once a week i think i'm
04:54 - going to try to go over what we're doing
04:56 - in the stream so the quick version for
04:57 - everyone who's new is
04:59 - this is my daily work i'm a front-end
05:01 - developer for a small university
05:03 - and
05:05 - uh i work partly from home and partly in
05:08 - the office i'm at home today and
05:10 - whatever i need to work on for for my
05:13 - job is what i stream so these streams
05:15 - aren't exactly tutorials although i do
05:17 - my best
05:19 - to explain what i'm doing and i'll
05:21 - answer any questions that you have
05:23 - but i say they're not tutorials because
05:25 - sometimes we don't go in a logical order
05:27 - in terms of starting with beginner level
05:29 - stuff and working our way up i just have
05:32 - to work on what needs to get done
05:34 - so
05:36 - having said that yeah i just want
05:38 - everybody to have the right mindset
05:40 - coming in that you know it's not a
05:41 - tutorial but it is a glimpse into my
05:44 - work as a front-end developer
05:47 - i may not be the average front-end
05:49 - developer i don't i don't really know
05:51 - but it may be helpful for you all to see
05:53 - what kind of work i do and most
05:55 - importantly how often i mess up because
05:58 - i i do mess up quite frequently if you
06:00 - don't believe me ask people in the live
06:02 - chat i'm sure
06:04 - anybody that's been watching for
06:06 - you know more than a few shows has seen
06:08 - me mess up quite a bit uh but we work
06:10 - through that together so feel free to
06:12 - put your opinions in as well uh if you
06:15 - see me in doing something that looks
06:17 - wrong call me out on it all right i i
06:20 - am very very open to constructive
06:23 - criticism
06:25 - uh so
06:27 - uh yeah so don't don't be afraid like
06:29 - i'm not here as the expert really i'm
06:32 - i'm here it's just another web developer
06:34 - and just sharing my stuff and sharing
06:36 - what i do
06:38 - all right let's get started
06:40 - and first i'm going to make this bigger
06:43 - so i'm sure that's difficult for you all
06:45 - to see
06:46 - and
06:49 - that should be big enough let me know
06:52 - uh so i have a preview open on my other
06:54 - screen so if i can read the text then
06:56 - usually it's good for you all to read it
06:59 - and uh so right now let me give you a
07:03 - recap
07:05 - if you're interested in seeing all the
07:07 - code yourself or even
07:08 - downloading the code uh for your own use
07:11 - or for you to work on it
07:14 - uh check out
07:15 - the
07:16 - link in the description for this github
07:18 - repo
07:21 - um
07:22 - all right so we we there's a really good
07:25 - question that just popped up in the live
07:26 - chat and uh it'll be good for me to
07:29 - address this before we start
07:32 - um
07:37 - state management so the question of
07:39 - state management are we doing redux mob
07:41 - x so here's what we're doing we're using
07:44 - component state
07:46 - right so usually when you hear about
07:47 - state management it's followed by
07:49 - with redux or with mob x or
07:53 - with whatever okay but we're going to
07:55 - use
07:56 - component just regular component state
08:00 - um
08:02 - why would we use that
08:03 - well i
08:05 - i don't think we need
08:08 - mob x or redux right so those are
08:10 - excellent things i've used them before i
08:14 - really i should say i've used redux
08:15 - before i haven't used modbx but i'm i'm
08:18 - aware of the differences
08:20 - uh so i like them both
08:22 - and i think they're very useful when
08:24 - needed
08:25 - but i don't think we have the complexity
08:27 - here in our use case
08:30 - that warren's bringing them on
08:32 - so
08:33 - i'm gonna go through okay well
08:36 - what if we don't really have to do that
08:37 - much but we do need to manage state uh
08:40 - we just need to pass state between a few
08:42 - parent and children components right
08:45 - how do we do that
08:47 - so that's what we're going to do today
08:49 - we're going to have the state
08:52 - live in a parent component and then it's
08:55 - gonna get passed down
08:57 - i think two levels
08:59 - uh to a child component
09:01 - right in this case a grandchild
09:03 - component i guess
09:05 - all right and then
09:06 - we're going to
09:09 - change the state that lives up here in
09:11 - the top component
09:13 - when we click
09:15 - on
09:16 - the child component
09:19 - so we're going to have to pass around
09:20 - some things so the state
09:22 - of open or closed gets passed down
09:26 - as props to our child component but then
09:30 - also we're going to need a
09:32 - a click handler that's going to live in
09:34 - the parent component that also gets
09:37 - passed down to the child component
09:39 - all right so this is not something like
09:42 - groundbreaking or really new like no
09:44 - one's ever done this before in fact
09:46 - we've done some similar things in our
09:47 - project
09:49 - before this
09:51 - but
09:52 - uh i'd like to walk through it with you
09:55 - all
09:56 - and i should here we are okay so let's
09:59 - see
10:03 - let's get rid of that i still haven't
10:05 - fixed the warnings on there so apologies
10:07 - for all that
10:10 - uh so here's what we have
10:12 - we have
10:13 - a drop down menu
10:16 - and then inside here
10:18 - we have a secondary level
10:21 - right and right now
10:24 - what happens is so i've opened these up
10:28 - and if i click out of here
10:31 - and i try to go back in
10:34 - they're closed
10:37 - that's not a really great user
10:38 - experience right because if i go to this
10:41 - section
10:42 - like let's say i go into
10:44 - one of these pages in the undergraduate
10:46 - section and i realized
10:48 - either i've read that page and i want to
10:50 - learn more or oh i'm on the wrong page
10:53 - then the user ought to be able to go
10:55 - directly back here and pick up right
10:58 - where they left off but that's not
11:00 - happening right now okay why is that not
11:03 - happening
11:05 - well that's what we're gonna figure out
11:07 - why and figure out how to fix it right
11:09 - and we can see that we've managed to get
11:11 - that to work here so i can open
11:13 - academics i can shut it
11:16 - and open it back up
11:19 - and it's still open
11:20 - right so we have the correct behavior
11:23 - that's happening here
11:25 - but not down here all right so i'd say
11:28 - the the first place that we ought to
11:31 - look then
11:32 - is
11:33 - how are we doing this here already and
11:35 - can we use that same technique
11:38 - uh for this this other part of this menu
11:42 - so for that let's go here
11:44 - and
11:45 - let's see we have drawer item
11:48 - okay yeah so drawer item
11:51 - drawer item is our component that
11:53 - and i forgot to start my clock there we
11:55 - go let's start our pomodoro timer
11:58 - so draw item
11:59 - is
12:02 - you know this this component
12:05 - so these are the drawer items
12:08 - so we can see in drawer item
12:17 - let's see we do have uh this click
12:20 - handler
12:21 - and that is what is expanding those
12:23 - those sub menus all right the the lowest
12:26 - level
12:27 - uh of the menu
12:29 - but we don't have any other click
12:31 - handlers
12:32 - right so
12:35 - at that top level
12:37 - which is here this top list item when we
12:39 - have an on click and expands the item it
12:41 - it calls this expand item and it passes
12:45 - in this case the item id
12:48 - but where is this coming from
12:50 - right so that's the click handler and
12:52 - then number two
12:54 - how do how does it know that that's
12:56 - supposed to be expanded well it's from
12:58 - this is open props so we need to track
13:02 - is open
13:04 - and we need to track expand item
13:07 - up the component tree and see what we're
13:09 - doing
13:11 - so
13:12 - drawer item
13:14 - the parent component for drawer item is
13:17 - drawer
13:18 - so let's see what's going on in drawer
13:30 - uh so let's find out where we have a
13:32 - drawer item and see what we're passing
13:34 - there
13:35 - okay so here's our is open and our
13:38 - expand item
13:40 - so it looks like this props drawer menu
13:42 - is about so it's actually props we're
13:45 - getting it from props here
13:47 - and then we're also getting this from
13:48 - props as well
13:50 - so our state doesn't live in this
13:52 - component either
13:53 - we need to go up another component
13:57 - so let's
13:58 - let's check it out now
14:00 - the parent component of drawer
14:03 - is a component called layout which i
14:05 - don't think i have up right now
14:08 - all right so let's
14:10 - open this up
14:14 - and find layout
14:17 - layout.js
14:20 - we'll close this
14:23 - all right
14:24 - so in layout
14:28 - let's see
14:31 - what we have
14:33 - let's go let's go down here to where we
14:35 - have drawer and you can see we're
14:37 - passing down
14:40 - the toggle drawer
14:43 - or i'm sorry the expand items and then
14:46 - draw items
14:49 - is this
14:50 - yeah so this is what were
14:53 - we were past passing down so you could
14:56 - see
14:57 - we're passing down from layout to drawer
15:02 - so you could see
15:04 - drawer items in this case it's dot about
15:07 - because this particular item is about
15:09 - we're not going to be hard coding the
15:11 - item name so we're definitely gonna have
15:13 - to come up with a different way to do
15:14 - that
15:15 - uh and then the expand item so and then
15:19 - we see that's what finally gets passed
15:21 - down to our draw item component so let's
15:22 - go back up to layout and see where these
15:24 - are coming from so let's find expand
15:28 - item
15:30 - which is a function
15:32 - uh that lives in this component and then
15:35 - let's check out state to look at drawer
15:37 - items in state
15:41 - so
15:42 - expand item accepts
15:45 - item id
15:49 - and then based on that id
15:52 - it changes the state
15:54 - of that particular item
15:58 - from
15:59 - either open or closed or i i believe
16:01 - it's true or false yeah so it's true or
16:03 - false meaning if it's true it's open if
16:06 - it's false it's closed so the menus you
16:09 - know true or open or closed
16:11 - okay so
16:13 - that's where
16:16 - essentially this
16:19 - needs to be
16:21 - either replicated
16:23 - or changed so that it can work in both
16:25 - situations
16:26 - what i'm going to do first is we're
16:28 - going to replicate this
16:30 - we're going to move
16:33 - basically we're going to move this
16:34 - function
16:37 - this sub item
16:38 - expander function right
16:41 - we're going to move that
16:42 - out of this component and into layout
16:46 - and try to make the same thing work uh
16:50 - here
16:54 - now if
16:56 - we find that maybe we could refactor and
16:59 - only use one function for both maybe
17:01 - we'll do that the first thing first
17:03 - things first let's just get it working
17:05 - okay now at this point i do want to ask
17:10 - do you think that it's necessary to have
17:12 - it live all the way at that top
17:14 - component
17:16 - for it to work
17:21 - like we wanted to
17:23 - could we just
17:24 - change things
17:28 - so that it would work
17:31 - um without moving it up
17:39 - so
17:40 - i'm going to start working on this but i
17:41 - do want to know if anybody if anybody
17:44 - really thinks hey there's a better way
17:45 - to do this
17:46 - so i'd rather
17:48 - consider a different way now
17:53 - than um
17:54 - then do all the work
17:56 - and figure out that it's not going to
17:58 - work
18:00 - or we could have done it a better way
18:03 - all right so
18:05 - as if anybody's gonna uh i know there's
18:08 - a delay so if anybody is gonna
18:10 - uh throw in their opinion i'll keep
18:12 - checking the live chat but while i'm
18:13 - doing that let's see
18:16 - first thing we're going to take is this
18:18 - we're actually let's remove this console
18:20 - log
18:22 - i don't think we need the console log
18:23 - anymore
18:29 - okay
18:32 - we're going to move this first
18:34 - and then we're going to move the state
18:37 - okay now if you'll remember
18:41 - we already have drawer items in the
18:44 - state here so we may have to change
18:47 - the name
18:50 - which is not really a big deal
18:57 - so first
18:59 - let's take this
19:02 - take it out of here
19:05 - and let's add it in now we've already
19:08 - renamed it from this other component
19:10 - which it was based on or this other
19:12 - function that was based on
19:14 - so we should be okay
19:20 - so now that is there
19:23 - but what we need to do
19:26 - is pass this down as a prop
19:29 - so in the same way that we've done this
19:32 - with expand item
19:35 - we're going to pass it down as well
19:39 - to
19:40 - draw
19:41 - as expand sub item
19:50 - alright so now expand subitem will be
19:53 - available to the drawer component
19:55 - all right so this function will be able
19:58 - to call this function
20:00 - from the drawer component
20:02 - all right so that's one step we got to
20:03 - take another step after that but
20:06 - first things first let's get this state
20:09 - set up as well
20:11 - so
20:13 - i don't want to mess up what's going on
20:15 - here with drawer items
20:17 - like i said we can always refactor later
20:19 - if we find that you know hey maybe we
20:21 - don't need separate things so i'm gonna
20:23 - say
20:25 - drawer sub items
20:31 - okay now that i think about it that
20:33 - naming doesn't make the most sense but
20:36 - i think it's um
20:40 - um
20:42 - i think it'll work
20:44 - so for drawer sub items
20:51 - yeah we're not going to put anything
20:52 - there yet right because we're not hard
20:55 - coding the values
20:58 - so we're just going to leave that as an
20:59 - empty object
21:02 - and now let's modify
21:04 - what we have here
21:06 - because we're no longer going to be
21:08 - setting the state for drawer items we
21:11 - want to set it for drawer sub items
21:14 - and we have to change what's here as
21:16 - well
21:21 - draw sub items okay so
21:25 - that's
21:27 - now uh when this is called
21:31 - it will take drawer sub items
21:35 - and it will combine whatever was there
21:40 - with the new value
21:43 - for this particular item
21:45 - okay so
21:47 - so far so good i mean logic wise it
21:50 - seems like it makes sense
21:56 - okay
22:04 - okay
22:06 - great
22:08 - oh i know we need to pass down the
22:10 - drawer sub items thought i was
22:12 - forgetting something
22:14 - so let's pass down
22:17 - we'll just copy this
22:20 - so we can change it
22:22 - um
22:26 - for
22:32 - sub items
22:35 - okay
22:36 - so these drawer sub items
22:39 - save that
22:41 - and now let's go down to drawer so
22:43 - remember
22:44 - we now have drawer sub items and expand
22:48 - sub item
22:49 - that we're
22:51 - we're gonna have access to in the in
22:53 - drawer.js
22:56 - all right so it's going to be a little
22:58 - bit different here
23:03 - so
23:05 - let's take this is open
23:12 - uh how am i gonna do this
23:17 - i was hoping to find a way to do this
23:20 - oh yeah here we go
23:28 - so we have four uh drawer items in here
23:32 - which it's it's a little silly we should
23:34 - really just map over these but we never
23:36 - got around to refactoring that
23:39 - so
23:43 - did i not get all of them
23:45 - no
23:47 - all right so i'm sure
23:48 - chinese multiple cursors to do all this
23:50 - in one go
23:52 - instead of uh copy and pasting
23:55 - there we go
23:57 - okay so
23:58 - i'm gonna have a new line here and we're
24:01 - gonna
24:02 - call this
24:05 - expand sub item
24:10 - and
24:14 - we're going to
24:22 - this
24:23 - props
24:28 - so
24:29 - item okay so essentially we're just
24:32 - passing that function
24:34 - down another level we're not doing
24:36 - anything with it we're just passing it
24:38 - on
24:39 - okay and then we need to change one more
24:41 - thing
24:44 - and let's see
24:50 - where it is
24:55 - open
24:56 - this is open
24:59 - and
25:00 - actually how did i pass this on
25:05 - juror sub items okay
25:10 - uh so i'm going to
25:16 - 2 3
25:18 - [Music]
25:26 - let's see let's take this is open and
25:33 - so
25:34 - is
25:35 - sub open
25:38 - okay once again the naming could
25:40 - probably use a little work here but
25:43 - uh what we're going to pass down is
25:46 - this props
25:52 - sub
25:54 - items
25:57 - let's make sure got everything
26:02 - all right looks like it
26:04 - okay so once again
26:07 - all we're doing here
26:08 - is just passing down everything from
26:10 - layout through drawer to drawer item
26:13 - we've done nothing to change it
26:19 - okay now
26:23 - here's where we need to to do a little
26:24 - bit of more work so we don't need state
26:28 - now in this component
26:30 - because our state
26:32 - now lives in layout
26:37 - but what we do have
26:40 - are a few more props so let's add them
26:42 - here
26:44 - so that we don't have to write this
26:46 - props
26:47 - within our component
26:49 - so we have
26:51 - is sub open
26:54 - and we also have
26:57 - expand sub item
27:04 - let me check my timer all right great 10
27:07 - minutes
27:10 - i feel i think we're going good on time
27:12 - because i haven't messed anything up yet
27:14 - it
27:15 - feels like i'm doing a good job today
27:17 - okay
27:18 - uh
27:20 - so now
27:22 - we we need to use these in the proper
27:24 - place
27:26 - so
27:28 - what we're going to do let's just grab
27:30 - this so that we can just kind of copy
27:33 - exactly what's going on here so let's go
27:36 - into our sub menu items
27:39 - and within there we're mapping over the
27:42 - items
27:43 - and if a particular item has another
27:46 - menu within it another sub menu
27:49 - all right then we're rendering this
27:51 - particular version of it
27:54 - and we need this on click
27:57 - oops not that one
27:59 - wrong one
28:04 - trying to find the right on click
28:13 - expand sub item
28:18 - there we are
28:21 - okay so we're gonna expand the sub item
28:32 - we don't need this all right so before
28:35 - we were calling this directly
28:37 - now we don't need it
28:39 - we have exp should work yeah so expand
28:42 - sub item and then we're passing it the
28:44 - item text
28:48 - so that
28:50 - uh
28:51 - that's going to be like the item id that
28:53 - we saw in in the function when we moved
28:55 - it into layout
28:58 - and then
29:00 - we need to make sure we're grabbing
29:06 - the right items
29:13 - yeah so we we no longer can get drawer
29:16 - items we need to get drawer
29:18 - sub items
29:32 - is that what we're getting
29:38 - so we caught it i'm pretty sure we did
29:40 - define it
29:52 - well let's get rid of this as well
29:55 - so that doesn't live in states
29:59 - what did we call him again
30:01 - oh you know what we just said is sub
30:04 - open
30:13 - all right i think
30:15 - all right this is the first mess up i
30:16 - think i forgot
30:19 - i forgot something
30:26 - yeah so what we were doing
30:34 - uh let me climb back up here to the top
30:37 - uh so we were getting
30:43 - some data
30:44 - where are we getting the data from
30:48 - the data was coming in before wasn't it
31:10 - oh there we are okay so here's our data
31:14 - so
31:15 - let me make sure we're gonna we have the
31:17 - data
31:18 - that we need
31:23 - okay
31:25 - i think we're fine
31:28 - i think i just um
31:44 - okay yes so let's go is
31:46 - sub open
31:54 - yeah is sub open
31:56 - item touch
31:59 - all right that's what we need
32:01 - sorry i was freaking out for a second
32:03 - because i was like wait a second like
32:05 - how are we getting our data in here and
32:08 - that was fine we didn't
32:10 - everything's all right
32:16 - so
32:17 - instead of drawer items again we need is
32:20 - sub open
32:26 - here we are
32:30 - and
32:33 - just double checking here
32:39 - making sure we have everything and now
32:40 - this should not affect anything down
32:42 - here because this is only
32:47 - uh for items that don't have
32:50 - a submenu
32:52 - okay
32:54 - all right let's save it
32:57 - and
32:59 - best way to figure out if we mess it up
33:01 - is just to check it out
33:02 - so
33:03 - if the page renders that's a good sign
33:07 - and it looks like it does i'm going to
33:08 - give it a hard refresh just
33:10 - to be sure
33:19 - interesting okay so we we got a flash of
33:22 - an error i don't know what that was for
33:24 - also let me check my time all right
33:26 - three minutes in about three minutes i'm
33:28 - gonna go to the live chat and answer
33:29 - some questions
33:30 - okay so that was a good sign i don't
33:32 - know what i mean other than that weird
33:34 - air that flashed up if it does it again
33:36 - then we'll look at it uh otherwise uh
33:39 - i think we'll be all right so let's
33:41 - check out this menu
33:43 - all right so that part still works
33:45 - wonderful we didn't mess with it so
33:47 - that's to be expected let's see if this
33:49 - click works
33:51 - oh that works
33:53 - let's see if it works for two different
33:54 - ones wonderful
33:57 - all right now let's shut the drawer
33:59 - and open it again
34:03 - nice it works see and it works for two
34:07 - of them
34:14 - nice i do want to test this out if i
34:16 - close academics
34:18 - and then open it
34:20 - nice it's still open i want to close
34:23 - this
34:24 - shut it
34:26 - open it
34:29 - nice all right our state is like super
34:32 - persistent now this is the behavior that
34:35 - we wanted
34:39 - excellent
34:41 - excellent okay so
34:43 - uh does anyone know
34:46 - i want to ask a question before i
34:48 - explain why i think this happened
34:50 - why like seeing
34:52 - you all saw when we took the code we
34:54 - didn't really change it other than some
34:56 - names
34:58 - all we did was take the same function in
35:00 - the same state and then move it up to
35:03 - components
35:05 - and now the behavior is different
35:08 - why is the behavior different why before
35:12 - did those sub menus automatically gets
35:15 - shut
35:16 - when we close the side drawer and open
35:18 - it back up and why now
35:20 - are they staying open why is the state
35:23 - persisting now when it didn't before
35:28 - so let me let me know what you all think
35:36 - and my timer's gotta be up by now
35:39 - just about
35:41 - okay i'm just gonna go to the uh short
35:44 - break right now since i'm not really
35:45 - gonna get anything done in a minute i'm
35:47 - scroll up to the top of the chat and i'm
35:49 - gonna go down through and get to as many
35:50 - questions as i can uh and i'll give you
35:53 - all time to answer why you think
35:56 - the state uh
35:58 - didn't persist and now it does persist
36:05 - all right so you see a lot of what are
36:07 - you saying hi uh
36:09 - grandpa fat boy says good evening
36:11 - everyone
36:12 - uh i don't know that i've seen that name
36:14 - in here so welcome
36:16 - welcome it's a special welcome to all
36:18 - the newcomers in here
36:20 - uh let's see
36:26 - let's see
36:28 - uh nikki says sorry i missed yesterday's
36:31 - stream about the infinite scrolling seen
36:32 - how we did it in
36:34 - jsaf intersection of servers awesome oh
36:37 - you know what nikki i didn't
36:39 - i totally forgot about it in jsaf i'm
36:42 - gonna check that out because we um
36:46 - we didn't fully implement it
36:50 - so um
36:52 - yeah i will check that out
36:54 - because that's
36:56 - probably a better way than what i was
36:58 - thinking
37:05 - michael says you should add backup
37:07 - singers to your stream backup singers
37:09 - make everything better
37:10 - alright cool babe you know what my
37:12 - wife's always singing all the time so
37:14 - maybe she'll want to be a backup singer
37:27 - it's
37:36 - uh king king darrow said heresy just
37:39 - messing around i assume that was in
37:41 - response when i said we're just gonna
37:43 - use component state
37:44 - so
37:46 - and uh for those of you who aren't
37:47 - familiar with react that much
37:50 - there
37:51 - you you do see like i mean i've seen it
37:54 - shift back and forth but
37:56 - uh you would
37:58 - you know at one point people were saying
38:01 - like never use component state you
38:03 - always want to use redux right and that
38:05 - was i think like overboard like there's
38:08 - too much to the one way uh i think it's
38:10 - more balanced now i do see people saying
38:13 - uh and have been for a little while
38:15 - saying
38:16 - like no component state is the right way
38:19 - to do it if it's not
38:21 - too complex so
38:24 - anyway
38:26 - uh
38:27 - yeah it's it's perfectly acceptable to
38:29 - use
38:32 - uh supra 28 says what are you using here
38:35 - for theming
38:36 - um
38:38 - material ui
38:42 - let's see
38:45 - hey phoenix is here how's it going
38:50 - oh king darrow says
38:52 - uh there's also a library called
38:54 - unstated
38:56 - which looks good uh says but i like to
38:58 - use mob x personally cool yeah i i've
39:01 - i've been interested in mob x i just
39:02 - haven't really had
39:05 - a project to use it on and to learn it
39:08 - i haven't heard of unstated then i'll
39:10 - have to check that out
39:17 - all right so i see some of the answers
39:19 - about um
39:21 - when i was asking like how should we do
39:23 - this where should the state live uh so
39:26 - it looks like most of you
39:33 - most of you agreed that the state should
39:35 - probably live in in layout
39:40 - noble and savage says hubba hubba liking
39:43 - your new office
39:46 - yeah like literally
39:48 - uh
39:50 - i am just in my basement in a corner of
39:53 - the laundry room
39:54 - i have a recliner and then i just have
39:57 - um a table
39:59 - with some monitors on it i have a laptop
40:02 - on my lap
40:03 - and i hung up like um
40:06 - it's not even a curtain it's a um a
40:10 - tablecloth
40:11 - i hung a tablecloth from the like the
40:14 - rafters and
40:16 - uh
40:17 - just to give me some sort of background
40:19 - so so y'all can't don't see like
40:23 - my family walking around back there
40:27 - so
40:28 - that's my office for now it works the
40:30 - recliner is
40:36 - comfy uh phoenix says i'm about to start
40:39 - with react in a few days i'm overwhelmed
40:41 - by the examples that are available i
40:43 - don't know where to start twitter clone
40:44 - medium clone shopping app website what
40:48 - um
40:52 - you know what i would say
40:56 - if you're looking for projects to start
40:58 - with
41:00 - check out the free code camp
41:02 - projects and just do it in react so look
41:06 - at the very first most basic one you do
41:09 - and try to implement that and react even
41:11 - if react's probably overkill for it
41:14 - but the point is just to learn react and
41:17 - start out slow
41:19 - so i think what's the first one is it
41:24 - the first project is
41:26 - i think the uh
41:28 - tribute page
41:32 - so i mean that's i i've heard of people
41:34 - doing that
41:36 - uh going through free code camp projects
41:38 - and doing them with react so
41:41 - uh i would try that
41:53 - okay so i did not get all the way
41:56 - through
41:58 - all the questions right now
42:00 - oh but actually you know what let me
42:02 - just go through the questions because
42:04 - i mean really
42:08 - we actually got it to work
42:10 - it's just insane let me go through some
42:12 - more of these questions and then i want
42:14 - to see if anybody answered that last
42:15 - question i asked uh and and we're gonna
42:19 - go over that so
42:23 - uh
42:24 - i did get through most of them so
42:25 - there's not that much left
42:34 - okay so john kane recommends um
42:38 - react 16 the complete guide
42:41 - which
42:42 - was ten dollars on udemy
42:46 - so
42:47 - uh check that out
42:49 - i've never checked it out so that's not
42:51 - really an endorsement i'm just
42:53 - uh
42:54 - you know but john john kane thinks it's
42:56 - good
42:58 - uh john john hanson says uh jesse kindly
43:02 - suggested that i give react a try i had
43:04 - barely gone from a simple understanding
43:06 - of jquery to javascript at the time now
43:09 - i have a fairly good grasp go for it
43:12 - awesome john i'm i'm glad to hear that
43:15 - that you're getting a good grasp and uh
43:17 - that's really cool that
43:19 - that you you consider me to be the one
43:21 - that
43:22 - uh
43:23 - was
43:24 - kind of uh got you into that so
43:27 - really cool
43:33 - nikki says following along with the
43:34 - tutorial helped me uh andrew meades and
43:37 - max schwartz mueller's are both great
43:41 - okay cool a lot of good resources thank
43:43 - you
43:48 - carlos says max's course is awesome
43:58 - let's see
44:00 - uh andrew asks what mic i'm using
44:03 - uh actually so when i'm working from
44:05 - home i just use the built-in mic uh for
44:08 - a macbook pro
44:10 - when i'm in my office uh like at
44:14 - at my place of work
44:16 - i
44:16 - have like a usb mic i don't even
44:19 - remember the brand it was inexpensive
44:21 - from amazon
44:23 - i'm probably going to end up getting a
44:25 - mic for home
44:26 - and
44:28 - maybe even a camera like an external
44:30 - camera
44:33 - because i when i have the laptop on my
44:35 - lap it tends to shift around a bit and
44:38 - uh i don't want
44:40 - i don't want to give anybody motion
44:41 - sickness by the
44:43 - the shifting of the camera so i think
44:45 - it'd be better if i had just a small
44:47 - tripod and
44:49 - and a camera that was stationary
44:53 - i bought the tripod already it came in
44:56 - i got a notification from amazon so
44:59 - i think it's sitting outside my door
45:01 - right now
45:02 - um
45:03 - but i i haven't decided what
45:05 - camera to buy and the webcams are a bit
45:08 - more expensive so
45:09 - i want to put some thought into which
45:11 - one i should get
45:17 - okay so carlos says the state persists
45:20 - because they went to the parent
45:22 - it is yeah so going to the parent was
45:25 - why it persists
45:30 - but let's see so
45:32 - i want to see
45:34 - i'll explain why i think it
45:36 - what i think the like exact issue was
45:43 - but i want to see what you all say first
45:48 - uh solely says uh just man says hi just
45:52 - managed to join in now just came back
45:54 - from work uh jesse i missed your past
45:57 - two live vids because you started early
45:59 - oh okay yeah sorry about that
46:02 - um i've been starting at different times
46:05 - if i start early then uh my viewers in
46:09 - india and anywhere in that time zone
46:12 - are those couple time zones you know
46:14 - together
46:15 - uh
46:16 - they are better able to watch otherwise
46:19 - it's too late for them
46:21 - uh so
46:22 - i don't know so for right now i'm kind
46:24 - of switching back and forth uh so do
46:26 - some a little later some earlier
46:29 - um so sorry about that i know it's
46:32 - there's no time i can stream that works
46:34 - for everybody so
46:36 - right now i'm just streaming at like
46:38 - different times
46:40 - and so sometimes you know different
46:42 - people be able to catch it live other
46:44 - times you know you may just have to
46:46 - catch the recording
46:48 - uh so
46:50 - i just i don't really know any other way
46:51 - to to do it to try to be fair about it
46:54 - so that everybody gets a chance to watch
46:56 - the watch it live you know other than
46:58 - varying the time
47:01 - javascript is here says jesse what's up
47:04 - uh
47:05 - nothing much just working
47:07 - how you doing
47:10 - and it's actually it's a really nice day
47:12 - here
47:13 - finally
47:14 - you know it's it's uh it's been pretty
47:17 - cold lately so today is like 70 degrees
47:20 - sunny
47:21 - a little breeze it's really nice
47:25 - i mean i'm in a basement
47:27 - with
47:29 - coding but
47:30 - it's still cool that it's nice
47:44 - frankie says the recliner looks
47:45 - comfortable it's actually it's
47:47 - comfortable but it is it's really old i
47:50 - got this recliner from my grandfather
47:53 - who had used it for a while
47:56 - and
47:57 - decided he was ready to get a new one so
47:59 - then i got this recliner when i was in
48:02 - was i still in high school
48:04 - i think i may have still been in high
48:06 - school i'm 32 years old now so i was a
48:08 - teenager i think when i got this
48:10 - recliner
48:11 - and i had the same setup at my parents
48:14 - house in my bedroom where i had a
48:16 - recliner
48:17 - and multiple monitors
48:21 - i used them back in the day to play
48:23 - video games not coding
48:26 - and i just after i
48:29 - got married i took the recliner with me
48:32 - and just have replicated this setup
48:34 - everywhere that i've lived every time i
48:36 - moved i just take it so
48:38 - uh
48:39 - it's actually like
48:42 - it's pretty ripped up it's still
48:44 - comfortable but i mean it's i'm sure
48:46 - it's not nearly as comfortable it was
48:48 - when it was new
48:49 - um but
48:51 - it's not suitable to be in my living
48:53 - room but it's okay to be in my basement
49:09 - uh javascript says don't mix jquery and
49:12 - react bad idea yeah for sure it makes
49:14 - things difficult if you for some reason
49:16 - have to mix jquery and react check out
49:19 - project one
49:21 - on the playlist for live coding with
49:23 - jesse because we did that and we made it
49:26 - work i'd love to change it so that we
49:29 - don't need jquery um
49:32 - but i go
49:33 - at some point in that series that
49:35 - project one i go through and explain
49:38 - like why you shouldn't do it like this
49:41 - and then i explain if you have to do it
49:43 - anyway here's how we do it and we we
49:45 - make it work and that that site's
49:48 - actually still live and and doing well
49:51 - uh so it can be done
49:53 - it's not the best way to do it
49:57 - uh so
49:58 - so don't don't do it if you can avoid it
50:01 - but sometimes it's
50:02 - you can't really avoid
50:10 - it uh javascript says where do you work
50:14 - i work at franciscan university of
50:16 - steubenville
50:17 - uh it's a small catholic college
50:21 - um in
50:23 - uh
50:24 - like eastern ohio so i don't know how
50:28 - how familiar you all are with uh
50:30 - united states geography but there's a
50:33 - point where the state west virginia so
50:36 - the northernmost part of west virginia
50:38 - meets
50:39 - with
50:40 - eastern ohio and western pennsylvania
50:44 - and right where those meet together
50:47 - oh uh steubenville is like pretty much
50:50 - right there
50:51 - so
50:52 - steubenville is
50:54 - very close to pittsburgh pennsylvania
50:58 - so if you know where pittsburgh is on a
51:00 - map
51:01 - uh just move a little bit west of there
51:04 - and as soon as you cross the border
51:06 - into from west virginia from
51:09 - pennsylvania into west virginia and then
51:10 - into ohio that's where studentvo is
51:15 - but anyway it's a small school i think
51:17 - we only have 2 000 students and
51:20 - i'm a front-end developer there
51:24 - but it's it's nice i i'm it's only about
51:26 - 10 minutes from where i live
51:28 - uh it's it's right next to where i grew
51:30 - up i grew up in west virginia uh right
51:32 - across the ohio river from where i live
51:34 - now and uh so my kids get to be around
51:37 - their cousins and their grandparents all
51:39 - the time my wife's family is actually
51:41 - from steubenville my wife grew up in
51:42 - stephenville so
51:44 - um
51:46 - so i really wanted my kids to grow up
51:47 - around all their family so that's why we
51:50 - end up here so it works well works out
51:52 - well that i can i can work here
51:55 - um
51:57 - be able to provide for my family i know
51:59 - a lot of
52:00 - a lot of people that grew up in this
52:02 - area had to move away
52:04 - because it's not really
52:06 - economically doing well but
52:09 - uh
52:11 - thankful that i was able to stay here
52:14 - let's see
52:15 - i lost my place i'm trying to scroll up
52:17 - and find my
52:19 - um nikki says on the state not
52:21 - persisting before you put state higher
52:24 - did the component get unmounted that
52:25 - would explain it
52:28 - yes i i believe we have a winner there
52:30 - so
52:31 - my
52:32 - thought was
52:34 - so after we implemented this
52:37 - i don't know it was a couple days ago or
52:38 - something um
52:41 - i noticed that behavior
52:43 - and i thought oh that's no good like we
52:45 - can't have that behavior and and i
52:47 - started thinking about it and that's
52:48 - what i thought is
52:50 - oh like
52:52 - what's happening is
52:54 - right like when state lived at this
52:57 - level right at this level
53:02 - like it would save the state here
53:06 - but then
53:07 - once this drawer was hidden like that
53:09 - was it component on mounts
53:12 - state is reset
53:16 - and then when we open it again
53:20 - it starts from all over again
53:22 - so the reason why that didn't happen
53:25 - with these
53:27 - was because the state for these things
53:30 - live way up at layout and layout
53:33 - encompasses all of this the whole page
53:35 - so in layout
53:37 - we have this app bar
53:39 - the footer and the side drawer
53:42 - and layout doesn't unmount
53:46 - layout stays as is
53:49 - and then
53:50 - this content here changes
53:54 - so
53:54 - if we want any state to persist
53:58 - it needs to be in layout
54:00 - right so
54:02 - that's what i thought oh okay if we just
54:04 - move it up to layout if we move the
54:06 - state up to layout then it will persist
54:09 - because it'll never unmount
54:13 - so you can see now like the benefit one
54:16 - of the benefits of using something like
54:18 - redux where the state would actually be
54:20 - stored somewhere else that is completely
54:23 - unaffected by components mounting and
54:25 - unmounting
54:26 - right if if you didn't easily have
54:29 - access to a top level component
54:32 - where you could store that state let's
54:34 - say your component was like eight levels
54:36 - deep you don't want to pass that state
54:39 - all the way down
54:41 - right that's that would be ridiculous
54:44 - then something like redux would be super
54:46 - helpful
54:48 - because the component the child
54:50 - component would immediately have access
54:52 - then to your redux store where your
54:54 - state would would live
54:56 - in this case since we're only talking
54:58 - about two levels
55:00 - it was fine
55:02 - right it makes sense
55:04 - would we have a little bit you know less
55:06 - code in our components if we went with
55:09 - redux a little bit less
55:12 - but then having all that extra redux
55:14 - stuff there doesn't really make sense so
55:16 - if we were doing this kind of thing
55:18 - everywhere all over the place passing it
55:21 - down you know even further yeah then it
55:23 - would make sense and actually um
55:27 - with the latest versions of apollo which
55:28 - is what we're using uh to get our
55:30 - graphql data
55:32 - you can also do similar things like that
55:34 - like to save your state in a store so we
55:37 - probably wouldn't even use redux we
55:39 - would use
55:40 - the apollo version of that
55:46 - all right so does that make sense to
55:47 - everyone
55:48 - so good job nikki and um
55:52 - uh who else someone else said so carlos
55:55 - was on on the right track as well uh and
55:57 - so good job uh for catching on to that i
56:00 - feel like i'm teaching the class when i
56:01 - was
56:03 - when i was asking questions but i just i
56:05 - don't know i wanted to give you all a
56:06 - chance to
56:08 - like say it first instead of me just
56:11 - talking about it
56:12 - uh
56:14 - anyway so that's the reason if anybody
56:15 - needs an ex like a better explanation of
56:17 - that let me know i'll try to do a better
56:19 - job
56:23 - john kane says i recommend the razer keo
56:26 - webcam 100 bucks on amazon
56:30 - okay cool let me you know let me open
56:32 - that up right now so i don't forget what
56:34 - it is on and on another screen
56:42 - all right
56:44 - so
56:47 - i will check that out after the stream
56:50 - i'm glad you mentioned that because i
56:51 - hadn't heard of that before at amazon
56:53 - like all the webcams that come up are
56:56 - like logitech webcams
57:28 - all right i'm skipping through a bit
57:30 - just trying to find some questions
57:46 - all right so several uh several of you
57:48 - are
57:48 - saying where you're from so we have uh
57:51 - india
57:52 - switzerland
57:54 - um
57:55 - awesome virginia so blacksburg virginia
58:00 - very cool so you're only one
58:03 - well i guess two states over for me
58:04 - since i'm not in west virginia anymore
58:19 - oh javascript says you're like half a
58:21 - state away from me
58:23 - awesome
58:24 - um frankie says can you view the
58:26 - mountains from your region in west
58:28 - virginia um
58:31 - where i'm at
58:33 - well i mean
58:35 - where i grew up which is
58:37 - just across the river from where i'm at
58:38 - right now
58:39 - uh it's
58:43 - it's like hills there are big hills
58:45 - right they're not really like
58:47 - mountainous
58:48 - so um
58:49 - i would have to drive a little bit
58:51 - further uh into west virginia to really
58:54 - get into uh with the the appalachian
58:57 - mountains
58:59 - um
59:01 - yeah so it's not it's not that far but
59:04 - uh it's a little bit of a drive so i'm
59:06 - kind of in the foothills of uh of the
59:09 - mountains so there's definitely
59:11 - definitely some steep windy roads around
59:13 - here
59:14 - uh but not exactly mountains but the
59:17 - state west virginia um as a state is
59:21 - really beautiful
59:23 - um and actually like virginia is too
59:25 - like that whole region
59:27 - uh like driving through there is just
59:30 - i mean there's some really cool if
59:32 - you're into like outdoor stuff like
59:34 - um i don't know like white water rafting
59:37 - camping hiking stuff like that i mean
59:39 - you can't be
59:40 - west virginia because like so much of
59:42 - the the state doesn't have a high
59:44 - population so so much of the state is
59:46 - just forests and mountains and and lakes
59:49 - and rivers and stuff it's just like
59:51 - untouched wilderness basically
59:53 - uh so
59:55 - it's really
59:57 - it's kind of cool and it's still pretty
59:59 - close to a lot of major cities and
60:01 - airports and things so
60:03 - you know you get kind of like the best
60:04 - of both worlds that you have the
60:06 - wilderness generally like really low
60:08 - property values low taxes uh but if you
60:12 - really wanted to enjoy like city life
60:14 - it's not that far away
60:19 - anyway i'm not getting paid by the
60:22 - tourism department of any state to say
60:24 - that that's my honest opinion
60:33 - uh gabriel's uh saying hi from sao paulo
60:36 - brazil awesome
60:38 - uh
60:42 - so thanks for watching
60:48 - uh sonny asks what language this is uh
60:50 - javascript oh
60:52 - nikki already answered i should have
60:54 - known somebody would have answered
61:04 - let's see
61:05 - uh renato asks what my opinion is on
61:08 - mobx i from what i've seen of mobx i
61:12 - really like it it honestly seems like a
61:15 - uh
61:16 - slightly less complex
61:18 - version of redux so i'm not saying
61:20 - they're the same thing right so they
61:22 - both solve like the same problem but in
61:25 - in slightly different ways
61:27 - so
61:29 - uh i would say
61:32 - i ended up learning redux first because
61:34 - it was a part of the udacity nanodegree
61:37 - uh if i had just decided to learn on my
61:39 - own i probably would have learned mob x
61:41 - first because it seems like mob x is is
61:44 - a little bit easier to to deal with
61:47 - um so
61:48 - unfortunately i haven't worked with it
61:50 - directly myself so i i don't really want
61:52 - to say too much more about it
61:55 - you know
61:56 - because it
61:58 - i don't know that i could give a really
62:00 - good good explanation or information but
62:02 - if you're interested in in using mobx
62:05 - and you're trying to decide between
62:07 - redux and mobx
62:09 - i would
62:11 - if it were me i'd probably
62:13 - go with mob x i'd try to learn that
62:15 - first
62:18 - although for i mean me right now since i
62:20 - already know redux i might go with redux
62:22 - but if i hadn't learned redux first i'd
62:24 - probably go to mobx
62:26 - hopefully that made sense i felt like i
62:28 - was talking in circles for a second
62:31 - uh nikki says react 16.3 also has the
62:34 - new context api you can use for that oh
62:36 - that's right that's right
62:38 - uh thank you for bringing that up nikki
62:39 - i can't believe i forgot yeah so uh the
62:42 - latest versions of react
62:44 - have another way to handle state which i
62:48 - need to learn more about that
62:51 - and maybe start using that
62:59 - carlos says teach us jesse we want to
63:01 - learn and love your videos that's
63:03 - awesome thanks for saying that
63:10 - frankie says thanks
63:13 - uh
63:14 - zutek
63:16 - sorry if i'm mispronouncing that name i
63:18 - think it's utech says uh hi and
63:21 - greetings from poland
63:22 - all right awesome i have um
63:26 - my my wife
63:27 - my wife's family and my family both have
63:30 - ancestors uh from poland
63:33 - so
63:33 - i've never been there
63:35 - uh but
63:36 - part of my family tree originated uh in
63:39 - poland so that that's cool
63:48 - frankie says i'm the girl who wants to
63:50 - go off grid so i agree totally cool that
63:53 - was what i was talking about like the
63:54 - you know the mountains and stuff
63:56 - yeah it's um
64:02 - it's cool at one time i was really into
64:04 - like the whole like homesteading thing
64:06 - like raise your own you know animals and
64:08 - have a garden and all kind of stuff like
64:10 - that um so
64:13 - right now i actually live outside of
64:15 - like city limits so
64:18 - it's uh
64:20 - like at one time i did raise animals and
64:23 - and do the whole like
64:24 - i wasn't completely off the grid but
64:26 - that was i was like
64:28 - working my way up to it
64:30 - um and then it
64:32 - i don't know it got it got difficult
64:37 - with um trying to work full-time
64:40 - and raise kids have four kids and things
64:43 - so it was just
64:45 - i kind of just let it go
64:47 - and we i still have a uh a garden and
64:51 - every you know stuff like that
64:54 - but i don't raise any animals anymore
65:01 - all right let's see
65:07 - trying to scroll down i
65:10 - my live chat window is messed up
65:20 - no ah i can't my live chat window got
65:24 - messed up and so i can't read anything
65:26 - let me
65:28 - restore it
65:30 - over here
65:33 - please work music
65:43 - yes alright i got it back
65:52 - all right sorry about that
66:08 - let's see
66:09 - uh renato says thanks for the answer
66:11 - says yeah malbec seems much simpler to
66:14 - understand at first
66:15 - yeah that was i mean that was my
66:17 - impression
66:22 - uh yusuf says greetings from indonesia
66:26 - awesome
66:32 - uh frankie says right i completely
66:34 - comprehend uh off grid
66:37 - all right cool
66:38 - um
66:39 - well that's the end of that's i've got
66:42 - to the bottom of the the chat uh the
66:44 - live chat
66:46 - and i know i said at the beginning i was
66:48 - gonna do two pomodoro sessions but
66:51 - amazingly i somehow managed to do what i
66:55 - wanted to do
66:56 - without messing up too badly and
66:58 - finished it in one pomodoro session
67:02 - which that is very very rare uh i i
67:06 - believe i've done
67:07 - for sure over 100 live streams
67:10 - and
67:11 - it
67:12 - i would imagine there are maybe less
67:14 - than 10 live streams where we accomplish
67:16 - everything we wanted to like in a
67:19 - shorter amount of time
67:20 - so
67:21 - today was a great day great way to end
67:23 - the week
67:24 - and uh thank you all so much for
67:27 - watching
67:28 - and uh for all your your advice uh in
67:31 - the live chat and and your help it was
67:34 - it was fun it was really fun stream
67:36 - today
67:37 - so
67:38 - uh i think i'll be back
67:42 - monday
67:43 - yeah what's going on monday
67:45 - i should be able to stream on monday
67:46 - i'll be in the office then not sure what
67:48 - we'll be doing then but uh
67:51 - probably most likely working on this
67:52 - same project i'm just not sure exactly
67:54 - what we'll do
67:56 - uh so and there were a lot of of new
67:58 - people in the stream today so i want to
67:59 - say again welcome thank you so much for
68:02 - watching hopefully you can all come back
68:04 - again for for another stream
68:07 - and uh yeah so i hope everyone has a
68:09 - really really awesome weekend and um so
