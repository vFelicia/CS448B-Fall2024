00:00 - hey what's up welcome to day one of css3
00:02 - in 30 days my name is brad hussey and
00:04 - i'm going to be helping you out over the
00:05 - next 30 days or so to
00:08 - learn css3 by actually building a bunch
00:11 - of things so
00:13 - day one is the very beginning and we're
00:15 - going to be getting started with some
00:16 - pretty cool stuff so let me show you
00:18 - what we're going to be doing uh right
00:20 - here in the browser so right here over
00:22 - in the browser this is day one uh css3
00:24 - fancy buttons i'm calling it uh we're
00:26 - going to be making some buttons
00:27 - exclusively with css3 just to kind of
00:30 - wet your whistle and get you excited
00:31 - about what's to come this is a pretty
00:33 - cool thing something you can use
00:34 - immediately in your websites and all
00:35 - that sort of stuff
00:37 - here's the shell kind of the outline
00:38 - this is what every lesson is going to
00:39 - look like we're not going to be coding
00:41 - that up but you're welcome to check out
00:42 - the css and the theme files and stuff
00:44 - that's cool but what we're going to be
00:46 - building is going to be further down
00:47 - here in the the web page so you can see
00:50 - we've got the sandbox uh this is what
00:52 - you're going to be using to you're going
00:54 - to manipulate this to make it look like
00:56 - the final result now below here is the
00:58 - final result let's scroll down
01:00 - we've got the final result and this is
01:01 - what we're going to be making this is
01:03 - the final example of what we're going to
01:04 - be doing we've got the facebook style
01:06 - buttons we've got the 3d buttons you
01:07 - know with some 3d cool effects and the
01:09 - circle and all that sort of stuff we got
01:11 - the gradient bordered buttons with some
01:13 - cool hover effects you can see that uh
01:15 - here the border of these buttons have
01:17 - gradients that's a css3 kind of
01:20 - hacking there animated button so when
01:22 - you hover over the buttons you get some
01:23 - cool animation effects
01:25 - and then adding an element in there
01:28 - we've got toggle switches
01:30 - changes the text in the button and the
01:31 - color and all that sort of thing the
01:32 - position of the inside switch and then
01:35 - you know you click to activate a button
01:36 - those sorts of things
01:38 - so that is what we're going to be
01:39 - building
01:40 - in our
01:41 - lesson today for day one css3 fancy
01:44 - buttons so what you need to do before
01:45 - you get started is download the course
01:47 - file so you can follow along and
01:50 - actually start making something right
01:51 - away i just click the link to download
01:53 - the course files and you'll be given a
01:55 - file that or folder a zip file with a
01:58 - folder in it that's called one dash
01:59 - fancy buttons it's going to have an
02:01 - index file
02:02 - like so it's going to have a
02:05 - sandbox.css file which you're going to
02:07 - be using to add your own css and a final
02:10 - css file which has everything that you
02:13 - need to reference if you go through the
02:15 - code you mess something up or you're not
02:17 - quite sure about something that right
02:18 - there is going to help you out
02:20 - you can use that for reference
02:23 - while you're building your projects
02:25 - and that final css is what styles over
02:27 - here in the browser this stuff over here
02:30 - so
02:31 - the sandbox styles this uh this section
02:34 - the final result is right here
02:37 - so those are the three files that you're
02:38 - going to get in this the the course
02:40 - files for this
02:41 - lesson and what you need to do is just
02:43 - open up your index file in your browser
02:45 - i'm using atom uh as my code editor so i
02:47 - got my course files in that code editor
02:51 - right here but then it also has a
02:52 - feature where you can open up the index
02:55 - uh html file in the preview over here so
02:58 - that's what i'm doing but you can open
02:59 - it up in a browser like safari or chrome
03:01 - so i suggest you go ahead and do that
03:04 - and then open up your code editor open
03:06 - up your sandbox.css now that we're here
03:08 - we should be at the same
03:10 - spot what we're going to start doing now
03:12 - is styling up these facebook style
03:14 - buttons let's just jump in not waste any
03:15 - more time
03:16 - so in the index file you're going to see
03:19 - the css classes that i use for the
03:21 - facebook style buttons facebook style
03:23 - button and then facebook style dark and
03:25 - light
03:27 - so let's just jump right in we're going
03:28 - to say
03:29 - facebook style btn and then we're going
03:32 - to say border radius
03:35 - 2 pixels
03:38 - let's do font size
03:40 - 0.9 ram that's referencing the the root
03:43 - font size rather than the parent font
03:45 - size that's a cool css3 feature
03:47 - padding we're going to go 6 pixels on
03:49 - the top and bottom 12 pixels on the left
03:51 - and the right save that pop over into
03:54 - your browser you can see already the
03:55 - changes are
03:57 - taking place looks pretty good so far
03:59 - nothing fancy but you know we're getting
04:00 - there
04:02 - let's select the
04:04 - facebook style dark
04:06 - button facebook style dark and we're
04:08 - going to start adding some box shadows
04:11 - so just to be um
04:13 - up to date here we're going to use
04:15 - moz box shadow
04:18 - and then i'm going to go ahead and
04:21 - say inset and i'll explain this in a
04:23 - minute 0 1 pixel 0 0
04:26 - and then a color 4d73
04:30 - bf i'm going to copy that whoa that
04:32 - needs to be a pound sign not a dollar
04:34 - sign
04:36 - paste that a couple times the second one
04:37 - i'm going to change to webkit
04:40 - and this last one is just box shadow and
04:42 - then i'm going to tab the uh
04:45 - the rule here whoops
04:47 - the style so that we can have them line
04:50 - up properly beautiful
04:52 - all right so moz is from mozilla
04:54 - browsers webkit is for webkit-based
04:55 - browsers and box shadow is just the
04:57 - fallback that uh you know modern
04:58 - browsers are able to pull from so that's
05:00 - what you would do
05:01 - to get your box shadow you can just put
05:03 - box shadow but then you know some
05:04 - browsers might not recognize it and then
05:06 - you won't have the box shadow effect so
05:08 - it's up to you if you want to do that
05:10 - css3 is a bit progressive so some
05:12 - browsers aren't quite up to date with
05:14 - certain rules and styles and things like
05:16 - that but at the bottom of every lesson
05:17 - over here in the browser
05:19 - you can see how compatible are these
05:20 - styles of major browsers if you click on
05:22 - this link
05:23 - it'll take you to a web
05:25 - site
05:26 - that will
05:27 - basically say can i use you know box
05:30 - shadow
05:31 - and you can say css3 box shadow
05:34 - and
05:35 - where it works it works in these
05:37 - versions of ie firefox chrome safari and
05:40 - you know you can kind of see so
05:41 - basically it says
05:44 - um unprefixed so this is prefixed styles
05:47 - over here in the code editor these are
05:49 - prefixed styles so technically we don't
05:51 - even really need to do that because it
05:52 - looks like
05:54 - 94.88 of browsers are going to support
05:58 - the unprefixed box shadow
06:02 - so that's pretty cool
06:04 - let's see safari 6 ios default browser
06:08 - ios 6
06:09 - don't work with zero pixel value for
06:10 - blur so there's information there you
06:12 - know you can reference that it's up to
06:13 - you if you want to do that
06:14 - so i won't waste any more of your time
06:16 - looking at that you can do that uh on
06:18 - your own time so let's go back
06:20 - to the style here there we go and let's
06:23 - jump back in here and i'm going to
06:25 - explain this here inset it makes the box
06:27 - shadow on the inside of the the box
06:30 - the block level element so inside of the
06:32 - div
06:33 - it's going to be
06:34 - the box shadows within the element
06:36 - rather than on the outside casting a
06:37 - shadow behind it it's going to be inside
06:39 - the element itself
06:41 - the first
06:42 - number here the first value
06:44 - is the horizontal the horizontal offset
06:49 - and that's if you put a positive number
06:51 - like five pixels it's going to be
06:52 - shifted to the right
06:54 - if you put negative five it's gonna go
06:56 - shift it to the left so at zero it's
06:58 - dead center
06:59 - the second one is the vertical offset so
07:02 - positive number like five pixels is
07:04 - going to be shifted down and if uh if
07:06 - you put a negative number like negative
07:07 - five it's going to be shifted up
07:09 - and then the second uh the third number
07:12 - here is the
07:14 - the blur radius
07:16 - and that's how blurry you want that box
07:18 - shadow uh zero would mean a sharp line
07:21 - and like 10 pixels would be a blurry box
07:23 - shadow depending on the effect you want
07:25 - and the this one is the spread radius so
07:28 - if you want it to be a really big you
07:29 - know
07:31 - the box shadow to spread then you'd have
07:33 - a higher number if you don't want to do
07:34 - anything than zero these are the only
07:36 - two that are required these two are
07:39 - optional
07:40 - values
07:41 - that you don't need to put and so then
07:43 - the last one is the color of the shadow
07:45 - so if i say this head over here you're
07:46 - going to see just the thin hairline in
07:48 - the browser and that's what we've
07:49 - created just a thin little blue hairline
07:51 - and that's all we wanted
07:53 - all right so next what i want is to
07:55 - change the background to it's going to
07:58 - be
07:59 - 4
08:00 - 2
08:00 - 6 7 b2 just for the background color
08:05 - border
08:07 - solid 1 pixel same color as the previous
08:10 - color there
08:11 - that's the facebook bluey purple color
08:15 - color of the text is going to just be
08:16 - white
08:18 - text shadow
08:21 - let's go for 0 1 pixel 0 and then
08:25 - 3 3 5 9 a 5 and that's just going to be
08:29 - you know a little bit darker
08:32 - of a text shadow under the white text so
08:35 - let's have a look and see what that
08:36 - looks like over in the browser if i save
08:37 - that
08:38 - button looks good we've got that slight
08:40 - border
08:41 - that little bit of a glow on the top as
08:43 - if a light was shining down on the
08:44 - button to give it a little bit of depth
08:46 - white text slight text shadow and under
08:49 - there beautiful looks great now we don't
08:51 - have any hover or active effects when
08:53 - you interact with the buttons so let's
08:54 - do that over here in the code editor
08:57 - i'm going to go down a couple spaces and
08:59 - tab in one that's not going to change
09:01 - the css at all it's just for
09:02 - organization i like having my
09:04 - related rules to be organized in a
09:07 - manner that i can see so if i tab in i
09:09 - know that this rule that i'm doing so
09:11 - facebook style dark
09:14 - and then um
09:15 - hover
09:16 - i know that this rule is directly
09:18 - related to this rule right here whereas
09:21 - these two
09:22 - are not uh as related they're kind of
09:25 - you know
09:26 - it's more so for my own organization
09:28 - purposes so you can do what you want but
09:29 - this is what i like to do feel free to
09:30 - follow along in that manner
09:32 - all right
09:34 - so on the hover what i want to do is
09:35 - change the background color to
09:37 - 2b54a7
09:42 - and save that
09:44 - and then we're going to copy this and
09:45 - paste it
09:47 - and change the hover to active so that
09:50 - what i'm going to do here is i'm going
09:51 - to change the background to 1
09:54 - d
09:55 - 4
09:56 - 6 9 8
09:58 - and then the border color to
10:01 - the
10:02 - same save that now if i go over here and
10:05 - interact with that button hover a little
10:07 - bit darker
10:08 - click
10:09 - an active state a little bit darker
10:10 - still the border is dark looks great
10:13 - all right
10:14 - let's style up that light button over
10:16 - there so head back to our code editor
10:17 - here
10:19 - a couple returns there let's go facebook
10:22 - style light
10:24 - and i'm going to say the background is f
10:28 - 6
10:29 - f 7 f 9.
10:32 - the border is going to be solid 1 pixel
10:36 - c e d o d 4 0 d4
10:41 - the border radius we already covered
10:43 - that
10:44 - the color the text
10:46 - color is going to be 4
10:49 - b
10:50 - 4
10:53 - f
10:54 - 5
10:54 - 6.
10:56 - i believe that's right yep it's like a
10:58 - gray
10:59 - and then the padding is good so that's
11:00 - all we need to do for the light button
11:01 - let's check it out it looks good much
11:03 - more minimal and simple i like that
11:05 - style
11:06 - uh and now we need to do is add the the
11:08 - hover and active states for that button
11:09 - as well so a couple returns down tab it
11:12 - in facebook style light
11:15 - hover
11:16 - and all we're going to do is change the
11:17 - background to
11:19 - e9 ebe
11:21 - and then we're going to copy this whole
11:22 - rule
11:24 - and change this one to active and then
11:27 - we're just going to change the
11:28 - background
11:30 - to d8 dade
11:32 - copy that and what we're going to do is
11:34 - change the border color
11:36 - to the same save that check it out
11:39 - interact with it hover a little bit
11:41 - darker click darker still looks great i
11:43 - like it
11:44 - all right
11:45 - so those are the facebook style buttons
11:48 - we're going to be coding the
11:50 - 3d css3 buttons we're still in the fancy
11:52 - buttons section of the course day one
11:55 - but we're gonna do the 3d buttons now so
11:56 - here in the browser you can see the two
11:58 - 3d buttons that we're going to be
11:59 - styling up so let's just do that go to
12:01 - our code editor
12:02 - i'm going to add a css
12:04 - comment flag here so we know where we
12:06 - are
12:08 - so the 3d button you can do what you
12:10 - want you could do a simpler comment if
12:11 - you want this is what i like to do
12:13 - keeps it nice and easy to organize and
12:16 - read so what we're going to be doing now
12:17 - is we're going to be selecting
12:19 - 3d buttons here uh we're going to be
12:21 - doing the button 3d one
12:24 - let me if i go up here actually
12:27 - button 3d1 and button3d2 that's what
12:28 - we're going to be selecting so let's go
12:30 - ahead and select button a 3d one
12:32 - and that is going to uh
12:34 - select that first 3d button we're going
12:36 - to style that position relative
12:39 - important because we're going to be
12:39 - doing a little bit of movement
12:42 - background is going to be orange red
12:44 - nice and simple no border
12:48 - color of the text is going to be white
12:50 - padding's me 15 pixels
12:53 - 15 pixels top and bottom 24 pixels on
12:56 - the left and the right the font size
12:58 - we're going to do 1.4 rim
13:01 - when you're using m it's relative to the
13:03 - parent element whereas when you're using
13:05 - ram it's relative to the root so it's
13:06 - just more consistent it's a nice little
13:08 - um
13:09 - measurement
13:10 - for css3 box shadow
13:13 - for uh for this we're gonna do box
13:16 - shadow we're gonna say negative six
13:18 - pixels six pixels zero whoops that's
13:20 - five pixels
13:22 - zero and then we're going to do hsl for
13:24 - hue saturation and
13:27 - whatever that is
13:28 - hsl so 16
13:31 - 100
13:32 - and then 30
13:34 - 16 is the hue 100 is the saturation and
13:37 - then 30 is the lightness so we want it
13:39 - to be this kind of like
13:41 - blood red sort of
13:42 - color for the shadow
13:45 - and then the outline we want no outline
13:47 - if i save that and we head over to
13:49 - our sandbox here you can see
13:53 - we have the 3d button it has the shadow
13:54 - over here but the thing is if i look at
13:56 - the final version it has
13:58 - it has this kind of corner that connects
14:00 - the two so while that looks pretty cool
14:02 - i want it to be connected so we're going
14:04 - to go ahead and
14:06 - work with that here in a moment but
14:09 - before we do that we might as well while
14:10 - we're here
14:12 - let's do the hover
14:14 - the hover and active states button 3d
14:18 - one
14:19 - hover
14:21 - we're going to do background is going to
14:23 - be hsl
14:24 - 16 100 and then 40
14:28 - i got these colors from photoshop by the
14:30 - way if you're wondering i'm not just
14:31 - pulling them out of the top of my head
14:33 - top pixels the top three pixels
14:36 - left negative three pixels this is why
14:37 - it was important to do position relative
14:39 - so that we can position the element
14:41 - based on uh when we hover it so in the
14:44 - box shadow we're gonna change it a
14:45 - little bit
14:47 - to negative three pixels three pixels
14:49 - zero and then
14:51 - uh hsl the same here
14:56 - so what that's going to do is when you
14:57 - click it let's or when you hover it
14:59 - let's check it out
15:00 - see how it pops down
15:04 - uh that's pretty cool actually i don't
15:05 - want that to do it on hover i want that
15:06 - to do it on active so that's going to
15:08 - actually be the active state and now
15:11 - above this i want to do the button 3d
15:14 - hover button 3d one a hover
15:18 - and that's going to be simple we're just
15:20 - going to change
15:22 - the
15:23 - background
15:25 - to hsl 16 145
15:29 - for lightness so it's gonna be a little
15:30 - bit lighter so hover uh it's actually
15:33 - it's actually a little bit darker so
15:36 - there we go and when we click
15:37 - it moves that button down so
15:40 - cool
15:41 - now what we want to do is we want to
15:42 - give those corners we want to we want to
15:45 - add those little corners to connect
15:47 - these two so it gives the illusion that
15:49 - they are one
15:51 - entire uniform
15:52 - box so we can do that
15:55 - by doing the before
15:57 - uh let me show you here so we're gonna
15:58 - do three
16:00 - button 3d
16:02 - one
16:04 - and then two
16:05 - colons
16:06 - if we go before it's like a virtual
16:08 - it's like a pseudo element
16:10 - of the here we go for it's a pseudo
16:12 - element that is the first child of the
16:13 - element matched so it creates a pseudo
16:15 - element that it's not actually on in the
16:17 - markup but it allows us to basically
16:19 - create an element of thin air that's
16:21 - connected to this div so what we're
16:23 - going to do is we're going to use that
16:24 - before pseudo element
16:27 - position it absolute this is where the
16:29 - magic happens it's pretty cool
16:30 - display block
16:32 - content we need to do this in order to
16:34 - for it to appear on the screen it needs
16:35 - to have the content uh and an empty
16:37 - string you can put text in there too if
16:39 - you want which we'll do at some point
16:42 - height zero
16:44 - width zero what we're going to be doing
16:45 - is creating a triangle
16:47 - and putting it in that corner there so
16:50 - if i were to save this now you're not
16:51 - going to see anything so there's no
16:53 - point in showing you
16:55 - what we're going to do
16:56 - is create a border now
16:58 - uh and let's see this it's going to be
17:00 - solid 6 pixels
17:02 - transparent whoa that is that word
17:06 - transparent
17:07 - uh now the border width needs to be the
17:09 - size of the elements box
17:12 - shadow
17:13 - so the box shadow here
17:15 - uh you can see it here so we have six
17:18 - pixels
17:19 - so
17:20 - we have six pixels up here so you'll see
17:22 - why in a moment
17:24 - and we're gonna do border
17:26 - whoops
17:28 - border right solid six pixels hsl
17:32 - we're going to do that
17:34 - color there
17:35 - 16 130.
17:39 - now
17:40 - i'm going to say this i'm going to show
17:41 - you over here in the browser look at
17:43 - this right here you can see this little
17:44 - triangle that we made do you see that
17:47 - so it's just appearing here in the
17:49 - within the button so you can see what
17:51 - we've made so far so we've made that and
17:53 - what we want to do
17:55 - is
17:56 - basically
17:57 - pull that up into the corner so we can
17:59 - use it a section of it to give the
18:02 - illusion that there's
18:03 - a connection between that between the
18:06 - button and its shadow so
18:09 - let's go back here in our code editor
18:12 - we're going to say border
18:13 - left with
18:15 - 0 pixels and what that's going to do
18:18 - is if we go back over here all it's done
18:20 - is moved the element over
18:23 - about 6 pixels so if i were to
18:25 - comment this out and save it now watch
18:27 - here in the browser as i refresh
18:29 - so i move it back over it's just when i
18:32 - add zero as the border left width it has
18:34 - no border here so technically
18:37 - the whole element is this big
18:39 - 12 pixels but i want it to be just the
18:42 - six pixels right here so i'm saying
18:44 - border left width over here in the code
18:45 - editor is zero it just cleans it up a
18:48 - little bit so that doesn't mess with my
18:49 - measurements when we move it
18:52 - uh the background none sometimes there's
18:55 - a background in the way i don't think i
18:56 - need to do that now what i'm going to do
19:00 - is say the top is 0 pixels
19:04 - that's going to push it over here in the
19:05 - browser to the top of the element and
19:06 - now i need to push it over and fit it in
19:09 - right here like a puzzle piece like
19:10 - tetris
19:11 - and
19:12 - the left if i were to say left 0
19:16 - what that's going to do is just put it
19:17 - over here in the browser it's just going
19:18 - to put it to the left here so i need it
19:20 - to be all the way over here and that if
19:22 - we know our math
19:24 - when we set that element up there is
19:26 - negative six or six pixels wide so this
19:28 - needs to be negative six pixels so the
19:29 - left needs to be negative six
19:31 - if i save that
19:33 - it's going to put it over there check
19:34 - out what just happened a little bit of
19:36 - magic gives the illusion that that
19:38 - element is connected just by creating a
19:41 - little css3 triangle with borders and
19:44 - moving it with positioning into that
19:46 - corner right here
19:47 - to give the illusion it's just
19:50 - this is cool
19:51 - okay so we're going to do the same thing
19:52 - for that bottom right corner
19:56 - but because we've already used the
19:57 - before pseudo element we need to use the
20:00 - after pseudo element so we have access
20:01 - to that as well so i'm going to copy
20:04 - i'm going to copy this because much of
20:06 - it is the same
20:08 - and all i'm going to do
20:10 - is paste it
20:12 - change it to after
20:14 - but we need to change the position of
20:17 - certain
20:19 - parts of the element so we can't just
20:20 - have it be the same because it's just
20:23 - going to show up in the same top left
20:25 - corner so we need to change it a little
20:26 - bit
20:28 - so it's actually going to be let me
20:29 - remove all of this right here
20:32 - except for the border solid transparent
20:34 - what we're going to do now is going to
20:35 - say border top
20:38 - is going to be solid 6 pixels
20:41 - and then we have that hsl we're going to
20:43 - copy that color
20:46 - like so
20:48 - border bottom width whoops
20:54 - is zero pixels
20:56 - so now if i save that come over here and
20:59 - you can see all we're doing now is the
21:00 - border
21:01 - you can see
21:02 - imagine this as a box it's actually a
21:05 - whole box and i'm displaying only the
21:07 - top section of the border so there's no
21:10 - there's no size to the box there's
21:12 - nothing in the div at all the height is
21:14 - zero and the width is zero but the
21:16 - border itself is six pixels wide so
21:18 - we've got a six pixel border
21:20 - on all sides one two three four this is
21:23 - the top
21:24 - all i'm doing is hiding the left right
21:26 - and the bottom borders and only showing
21:28 - the top border so it has this triangle
21:31 - effect so it's a cool little illusion
21:33 - that you could do in css3
21:35 - so the the border top is six pixels and
21:37 - the border bottom is going to be zero
21:41 - and the oh so you can see here the
21:43 - border transparent all the borders are
21:45 - transparent so if i were to remove the
21:47 - border top
21:48 - uh over right and then go back here in
21:50 - the browser refresh you can see it's
21:52 - gone because the border is transparent
21:54 - but six pixels wide
21:56 - but now if i change the border top which
21:58 - is the one i want to show
22:00 - to solid so we can see it six pixels and
22:02 - give it a color save it now it's going
22:04 - to show
22:06 - and then the border bottom width i'm
22:07 - just making it zero so that it collapses
22:09 - so it doesn't give us this
22:11 - messy
22:12 - you know 12 pixel box when all i need is
22:16 - six pixels does that make sense i hope
22:18 - it does
22:20 - it's quite simple and
22:21 - awesome it's a pretty cool little
22:22 - concept to create css3 triangles okay so
22:26 - we've done that now all we need to do is
22:28 - we need to move it so the right is going
22:29 - to be zero so it's all the way over to
22:31 - the right so as you can see in the
22:32 - browser if i were to save this it's
22:34 - going to pop over all i need to do now
22:36 - is move it down
22:38 - all the way to the bottom let's uh let's
22:41 - go here we're gonna go
22:43 - bottom negative six pixels in the
22:45 - browser
22:47 - pop over here look at that it moved it
22:50 - all the way to the bottom now we have
22:51 - this effect that it's connected it's
22:53 - quite magical cool
22:54 - okay now we have one little thing that
22:56 - we need to fix here if i were to click
22:57 - on this watch what happens it's going to
22:59 - move the whole element but now we can
23:01 - see our little
23:02 - triangles so that's a problem so what we
23:05 - need to do now is when we on the hover
23:07 - on the active states of the before and
23:10 - after pseudo-elements we need to shrink
23:11 - those triangles so that it still gives
23:14 - the effect to the illusion that it's a
23:15 - full box so that's quite simple all we
23:18 - need to do is add a couple extra things
23:20 - here
23:21 - i'm going to say
23:22 - button 3d 1
23:24 - active and then before so this means
23:27 - when it's active i want to select the
23:29 - before pseudo element and we're going to
23:31 - change the border
23:32 - to solid 3 pixels rather than 6 pixels
23:35 - because it needs to be the size of the
23:36 - border width transparent
23:40 - perfect the border right is going to be
23:42 - solid 3 pixels it's going to be that hsl
23:45 - up here copying that pasting that
23:48 - and then the border left width is going
23:51 - to be
23:52 - three uh zero pixels
23:54 - although i don't know if we necessarily
23:56 - need to do that so i'm just going to
23:57 - remove
23:58 - that because i've already declared it
24:00 - and then left is going to be negative
24:02 - three pixels rather than negative six
24:04 - pixels if i save that and now watch this
24:06 - the left side well that doesn't look
24:08 - good at all
24:10 - okay something went weird there maybe i
24:12 - do need to to
24:14 - declare the border left width to zero
24:18 - let's see what that does
24:21 - so i needed to do the border left with
24:22 - to zero for some reason uh and now
24:25 - that looks good but the bottom one
24:26 - doesn't look good so let's just copy all
24:28 - this
24:30 - and then paste it below we're going to
24:31 - change it to the after a pseudo element
24:34 - border is going to be solid 3 pixels the
24:37 - border top is going to be solid 3 pixels
24:40 - and then the border bottom width is
24:42 - going to be 0
24:44 - and then the bottom is gonna be negative
24:46 - three save that check it out in the
24:48 - browser now we've got a perfectly
24:50 - working 3d button with all of the
24:52 - corners and the triangles working
24:53 - perfectly in sync
24:55 - awesome
24:57 - that is beautiful
24:59 - all right now let's do these uh the
25:01 - second 3d button here the circle looks a
25:03 - little bit like this it's a circle it's
25:04 - got a radial gradient uh when you've got
25:06 - this back here this kind of
25:09 - depth to it so when you it looks like
25:11 - it's popping off the the background and
25:14 - then when you click it it kind of sinks
25:15 - into it and it's a cool 3d effect
25:18 - so we're going to create that button
25:20 - right now pop over to your code editor
25:21 - uh and now i'm going to add that comment
25:23 - flag for 3d button number two
25:26 - so i know where i am
25:29 - okay and first thing i'm going to do is
25:30 - i'm going to select that uh button so
25:32 - it's the class of btn-3d2
25:36 - we're going to start off saying position
25:38 - relative because we're going to be doing
25:39 - a little bit of positioning so we need
25:41 - that to have
25:42 - uh something declared
25:45 - a fallback background we're going to
25:46 - change have it be kind of like a yellow
25:48 - ecd 300
25:50 - and then that's just going to be default
25:51 - yellow but we're going to want to add
25:53 - some radial gradients so we're going to
25:54 - also declare another background
25:58 - and then we're going to say webkit
25:59 - radial
26:00 - gradient
26:03 - and this requires two values you could
26:04 - say like red comma blue and then it will
26:07 - look something like this
26:09 - over here in the browser you can see
26:10 - pretty ugly radial gradient but that's
26:12 - how the radial gradient works we're
26:14 - going to be declaring a few these are
26:15 - browser prefixes so i'm going to do
26:17 - webkit oh
26:18 - moz and then just the fallback standard
26:20 - syntax
26:21 - so we'll get there
26:22 - so instead of red and blue we're going
26:24 - to do something a little bit more
26:25 - complicated we're just going to be using
26:27 - hsl again for hue saturation saturation
26:30 - and lightness the hue is 54 100 for the
26:33 - saturation so fully saturated and 50
26:37 - in terms of lightness so slightly dark
26:39 - not 100 like white not zero like black
26:41 - we just wanted to be in the middle
26:44 - uh and then i'm gonna do another hsl
26:46 - i'm gonna do the same color the same hue
26:48 - and saturation but different lightness
26:50 - 40 so i'm going to copy this paste based
26:53 - based
26:54 - change the first the second
26:56 - browser prefix to the letter o
26:58 - for opera and then the third one to moz
27:01 - for mozilla and the last one just remove
27:03 - the prefix altogether that's the
27:04 - standard syntax that right there is
27:07 - going to give you a radial gradient
27:08 - check it over in your browser looks a
27:10 - little bit like that nice fine and dandy
27:13 - beauty
27:14 - let's uh move down
27:16 - back here in our code editor font size
27:18 - we're going to say 1.4 ram
27:20 - and then we're going to go ahead and do
27:22 - some text shadows and that's going to be
27:24 - 0 negative 1 pixel
27:27 - 0 and then c 3 a f 0 7. what's that
27:31 - negative 1 pixel do that's the vertical
27:34 - offset for the text shadow so if i had a
27:36 - positive number like one pixel the text
27:39 - shadow would be one
27:41 - uh
27:42 - pixel below the text but a negative
27:44 - value like negative one is one pixel
27:46 - above the text so i want the shadow to
27:47 - be above the text
27:49 - and zero here is the i believe that's
27:52 - the horizontal axis uh offset sorry and
27:55 - this is the blur the third value is the
27:56 - blur i don't want any blur and i want
27:58 - any horizontal offset i just want
28:00 - negative one uh vertical offset so that
28:03 - it's slightly above the text and then
28:06 - a slightly lighter
28:08 - a more white yellow than what is
28:11 - on the background
28:13 - you'll see the effect that that gives
28:14 - shortly
28:16 - color of the text is going to be white
28:19 - border solid one pixel we got that hsl
28:22 - again we're going to do 54 100 percent
28:25 - and 20 so a little bit dark
28:28 - and then we got the border radius
28:31 - that's going to be 100 for full circle
28:34 - height 120 pixels
28:37 - width 100
28:41 - 20 pixels
28:42 - z index four
28:44 - uh because we're going to be playing
28:46 - with some positioning of the z index
28:48 - because we're going to have that
28:49 - background uh behind it we want to
28:52 - make sure it's above you know there's a
28:54 - method to my madness okay
28:57 - so z index four uh now let's check it
28:59 - out in the browser perfect circle looks
29:01 - great you can see uh
29:03 - the text here look at the text shadow
29:05 - you can see that slight dark gr
29:08 - yellow
29:09 - it looks like the circle text is
29:12 - indented within the element so that's
29:13 - what that effect gives it versus the
29:16 - facebook button we did up here where the
29:18 - text shadow was below it makes it look
29:20 - like it pops off the button this one i
29:22 - wanted to make it look like it's in the
29:23 - button a little bit like it's uh
29:25 - you know you take like a stamp like it's
29:27 - stamped inside of it okay now we're
29:29 - gonna do watch this when i click this it
29:31 - has this gnarly looking outline no
29:33 - outline doesn't let me do border radius
29:35 - so we're just gonna remove the outline
29:36 - pop over to the code editor outline none
29:39 - gone i don't usually like to remove
29:40 - outlines for accessibility reasons but
29:42 - in this case it's gone we're gonna do
29:45 - something else
29:46 - all right
29:47 - we're gonna do some box shadows we're
29:48 - gonna create this effect right here over
29:50 - in the browser it gives this cascading
29:52 - effect that makes it look like it's
29:54 - lifted off of the background we're going
29:55 - to do that right now with a bunch of box
29:57 - shadows so let's go back to the code
29:58 - editor and start off with box shadow
30:02 - i'm not going to do the browser prefixes
30:04 - because box shadow is pretty widely
30:06 - accepted and i don't want to write this
30:07 - out so many times
30:08 - so box shadow we're going to start with
30:10 - an inset
30:11 - 0
30:12 - 1 pixel 0 hsl 54 100
30:17 - and 50
30:19 - and if i left it at that it's going to
30:21 - give us this slight hairline above it
30:23 - making it look like the light is shining
30:25 - down from above and giving it a little
30:26 - bit of a
30:28 - depth looks nice
30:29 - cool thing is i can add more um
30:33 - i can add more than one line to this box
30:35 - shadow instead of writing box shadow box
30:36 - shadow box shadow like that which i
30:37 - don't even know it will work you can
30:39 - actually just separate the values with a
30:41 - comma
30:42 - go to a new line
30:44 - just for readability purposes and add
30:46 - another
30:47 - value for the box shadow style so that's
30:50 - cool so we're gonna do
30:52 - not in set for the second one two pixels
30:54 - zero hsl you guessed it 54 100 and 20
31:00 - now
31:01 - what we're going to do here is we're
31:02 - going to copy this line
31:04 - and separate it by comma paste it
31:07 - change a couple values three pixels for
31:09 - the next one
31:10 - and take off a couple percent
31:13 - you'll be able to see a pattern here
31:16 - sixteen percent separated by comma this
31:19 - is going to be six pixels this is going
31:21 - to be 14
31:23 - this one is going to be
31:25 - seven pixels oops this four
31:27 - five
31:28 - six
31:30 - pixels and this is going to be 12
31:33 - uh 7 pixels
31:35 - 10
31:37 - just a couple more
31:39 - 8 pixels
31:41 - 8
31:42 - and this one's going to be 9 pixels and
31:44 - then
31:45 - six percent it basically goes to black
31:48 - end it with a semicolon save that check
31:50 - it out over here in the browser
31:51 - you get that cool effect looks pretty
31:54 - pretty cool you can see what happens
31:55 - just adding more block shadow values
31:58 - it's just giving that effect it's
31:59 - gradually going to darker that gives the
32:01 - illusion that it's kind of
32:02 - three-dimensional
32:03 - pretty cool
32:05 - uh now what we're going to do is when we
32:06 - hover and uh click on it we're going to
32:08 - give it some
32:09 - some styles
32:11 - so i'm going to go over here to my css
32:14 - tab it in
32:16 - not final sorry
32:18 - btn-3d2
32:21 - hover
32:22 - we're going to change the
32:24 - radial gradient
32:26 - so i'm just going to copy it up here
32:29 - i'm going to leave the fallback i don't
32:30 - need to change that
32:32 - if you want you can
32:34 - and i'm going to change the radial
32:35 - gradient
32:37 - all around so that when you hover it
32:38 - changes the color of it
32:41 - so hsl 54 100 that's going to stay the
32:43 - same but we're going to change the
32:44 - lightness to 45 on here and
32:49 - 35
32:51 - on there copy that the two hsl values
32:54 - paste them in each
32:56 - of the
32:57 - styles here
32:59 - save you typing save that check it out
33:02 - in the browser and you're going to hover
33:03 - it's going to work beauty beautifully
33:06 - and then now we're going to do is on the
33:08 - active state we're going to change the
33:10 - radial gradient as well
33:12 - so copy all that
33:16 - and then change hover to active and
33:18 - we're going to change the values from 45
33:20 - to 43 and 35 to 30. 33
33:25 - copy both of those
33:28 - paste them in each of the lines here to
33:30 - save you some typing
33:32 - just like that
33:34 - cool
33:35 - and now
33:36 - uh we'll just check it out so here in
33:38 - the browser hover active hover active
33:41 - default hover active looks good okay now
33:44 - below these lines here we're gonna
33:47 - do top two pixels we're gonna bump it
33:49 - down two pixels when we click on it now
33:52 - uh watch what happens over here in the
33:54 - browser click pops down two pixels but
33:57 - there's a problem it moves the entire
33:58 - element down i only wanted to
34:01 - to move the foreground down two pixels
34:04 - not the box shadows so how do we do that
34:07 - because here you can see we kind of do a
34:09 - similar thing it almost sinks into the
34:11 - button like you're clicking
34:13 - you know
34:14 - clicking a button
34:15 - see how it syncs down
34:17 - so that's what we want to do here with
34:19 - the circle we don't want to move the
34:20 - background the that part we want to move
34:23 - just the top so how do we do that
34:25 - easy
34:26 - over here in your active css rule we're
34:29 - just going to copy that box shadow that
34:31 - we did up here
34:33 - and all we're going to do because we
34:34 - need to account for 2 pixels that we're
34:36 - bumping down all we need to do
34:38 - is remove the last two lines of box
34:42 - shadow
34:43 - replace that last one with a semicolon
34:45 - save it
34:47 - and now because we've taken two of those
34:48 - out that was two pixels it's going to
34:50 - accommodate this click
34:55 - all right now we're going to mess around
34:56 - with these gradient bordered buttons
34:58 - right here you can see we got this one
35:00 - kind of this uh orangey red to yellow
35:03 - from the bottom right bottom left hand
35:05 - corner up into the right hand corner
35:07 - there you could you see the point here
35:09 - is that the border has a gradient on it
35:11 - and then when you hover you get the
35:13 - gradient on the inside but the point
35:14 - here is that you can make
35:18 - borders have gradients which is cool and
35:19 - then the second example we actually have
35:21 - this
35:22 - i don't know if it's necessarily
35:23 - practical but it's just a cool practice
35:25 - uh something just to show you what you
35:27 - can do is you can actually have the
35:28 - border fade out
35:30 - so we have it from going left to right
35:32 - and then it just fades out kind of into
35:34 - nothing and then when you hover the
35:35 - background does the same so why don't we
35:37 - jump in and do that
35:39 - uh over in our code editor
35:41 - sandbox.css i'm going to go ahead and
35:43 - add that css
35:44 - comment
35:46 - uh just like so
35:48 - gradient bordered buttons you can do
35:49 - something simpler if you want
35:51 - i just like doing that all right so
35:53 - we're gonna
35:54 - check out in the index.html what is what
35:56 - are the classes that we're working with
35:58 - we've got uh gradient button one
35:59 - gradient button two
36:01 - beauty okay so
36:04 - gradient
36:05 - button dash one
36:07 - we're gonna start off and give it a
36:09 - position of relative oh that's weird
36:12 - that's not what we want relative and
36:14 - then uh z index one just to keep it all
36:17 - at one level just in case we have some
36:19 - uh weird stuff going on
36:21 - with uh overlaps and stuff
36:24 - uh display inline block
36:27 - padding
36:29 - uh 20 pixels of 40 40 pixels
36:34 - and then we're going to say font size
36:36 - let's go for
36:37 - 1.4 ram
36:40 - box sizing is gonna be border box so
36:43 - that the 20 and 40 pixels uh it doesn't
36:46 - add more
36:47 - width and height to the button when we
36:49 - add a thick border to it that stays
36:52 - within the constraints of the dimensions
36:54 - that we set
36:56 - uh then we're gonna go background
36:58 - color
37:00 - e
37:01 - seven e e f one
37:04 - and that's just a background color
37:08 - and then we're going to do a border of
37:10 - solid 10 pixels
37:13 - and transparent
37:16 - so we're going to give it it's going to
37:18 - be solid and 10 pixels but no color
37:20 - because we're going to we're going to
37:22 - add that here using
37:23 - border image
37:26 - we're going to do the linear
37:28 - gradient
37:30 - and then parentheses then we have a
37:31 - couple few values here so we're going to
37:33 - say two
37:34 - top right which means it's coming from
37:37 - the bottom
37:38 - left and moving up to the top right
37:40 - that's what that means you could also
37:42 - say to bottom right to to top left to
37:45 - you know
37:46 - bottom left or you could just say top
37:48 - right bottom or left and have it be
37:51 - linear you know have it go from the top
37:53 - to the bottom left to the right all this
37:55 - does is it goes up on an angle and
37:57 - that's what i want to be able to achieve
37:58 - here
38:00 - and then we need to have some colors the
38:02 - first color
38:03 - i'm gonna go with orange red and then
38:04 - the second yellow and then if i save
38:06 - that let's see what that looks like okay
38:08 - so we've got each of the corners
38:12 - uh have that gradient so it kind of
38:14 - looks weird it's not really what we want
38:16 - from but it has the color so from bottom
38:18 - left to top right it's got that orange
38:20 - red to yellow so the gradient's right
38:22 - but
38:23 - it's just
38:24 - popping into the corners now the way we
38:26 - fix that is using a css property called
38:29 - border image
38:30 - slice basically
38:32 - it specifies how to slice the image so
38:35 - you can use the border image and put an
38:37 - actual image as the border but i'm using
38:38 - a gradient
38:40 - so i found that if we put
38:43 - if we go back here to our code editor
38:45 - and if we were to put the border image
38:47 - slice
38:49 - now you could put different values in
38:51 - there but the the value that i'm going
38:52 - to put is literally just the number one
38:56 - and what that does is it fills out
38:59 - so that each of those corners connect
39:01 - that's what that does uh you can also
39:03 - play around with different values and
39:04 - see what happens and there's also
39:06 - different things like fill and so on and
39:08 - so forth you can read about it in the
39:09 - browser support but
39:11 - border image slice one connects all
39:13 - those corners and so there we go our
39:15 - gradient and essentially
39:17 - essentially it's done
39:18 - that's gradient button you know gradient
39:20 - border button one but i just want to
39:23 - make it a little bit more interactive it
39:24 - doesn't really look like a button hey
39:26 - gun
39:30 - all right and then color let's uh make
39:32 - the text color orange red as well
39:36 - and then we're going to say
39:37 - um
39:38 - transition
39:41 - this is just for uh when we have a
39:42 - little bit of an effect to hover effect
39:45 - 0.3 seconds
39:47 - is in out i like that one you can use
39:49 - ease you can use linear you can use quad
39:52 - ease in or whatever there's a bunch of
39:54 - different transition properties so
39:56 - transition ease in out works fine for me
40:00 - but you won't see it until we use it on
40:01 - the hover so we're going to tab in here
40:03 - we're going to say
40:04 - gradient
40:06 - button dash one
40:10 - and that's going to be hover
40:13 - and we're just going to say
40:16 - background
40:18 - image
40:19 - linear gradient we're going to do linear
40:21 - gradient as well
40:23 - and then two top right and we're just
40:25 - going to fill out the same
40:27 - style gradient orange red comma yellow
40:31 - that's what that will get you save that
40:33 - check it out here when i hover it's
40:35 - going to give us that
40:37 - gradient in the background and then
40:39 - let's say
40:41 - color white
40:43 - save that check it out
40:45 - it should look pretty good there when
40:46 - you hover the
40:47 - the text color slowly fades into white
40:50 - from the orange red and then the
40:52 - background pops in there
40:54 - filling in that gradient so that looks
40:56 - pretty cool the point here was the
40:57 - gradient border
40:59 - around the button itself
41:01 - okay so now let's jump down to
41:03 - gradient button two let's do that one
41:05 - real quick here
41:07 - so we're gonna do gradient
41:09 - button dash two
41:13 - and we're gonna do position
41:15 - relative
41:18 - z index one that should do the trick
41:22 - padding let's see we probably just copy
41:24 - a lot of this actually why don't we just
41:26 - hey folks let's save some time copy all
41:28 - this goodness gracious all we're going
41:31 - to do is just paste that in there
41:33 - we're not doing anything new or crazy
41:35 - except for maybe let's change the size
41:38 - of the border so instead of 10 pixels
41:40 - let's just make it like four pixels
41:42 - and the colors let's do orange red to
41:46 - transparent but right now because we're
41:48 - doing the top right it's not what i want
41:50 - i want it to go
41:52 - to
41:53 - right
41:54 - so orange red to transparent so it's
41:57 - going to fade out
41:58 - leave the color and the transition there
42:01 - and then we're gonna copy the hover as
42:03 - well
42:05 - because we need that for interactive
42:07 - kind of accessibility reasons
42:09 - it's gonna be button two gradient button
42:11 - two and this is gonna be two
42:13 - right
42:15 - this is gonna be to transparent and that
42:18 - should do the trick
42:20 - let's see what happens save it check it
42:22 - out in your browser
42:23 - looks good so far when i hover whoops
42:26 - what's going on there a border shows up
42:28 - on the right side what we need to do on
42:29 - hover is remove that border so let's go
42:31 - back to our code editor and simply say
42:34 - border
42:35 - write style
42:37 - none
42:38 - that
42:39 - should do the trick go back here hover
42:41 - perfect there you go so we have grading
42:43 - border button one and gradient border
42:45 - button two very simple nice little trick
42:47 - using border images and linear gradients
42:50 - i like it
42:51 - all right now let's do these animated
42:53 - buttons here you can see the first
42:54 - example animated button we got a
42:55 - background pattern and then when you
42:57 - hover it just kind of slightly
42:59 - animates you know from you know from the
43:01 - left to the right and continually goes
43:02 - infinitely until you just kind of take
43:04 - your mouse off the off the button uh
43:07 - you use that you know this is just a
43:09 - simple example you can do anything from
43:12 - gradients to background patterns to
43:13 - background images uh you know to when
43:16 - you hover over a button you can do
43:17 - different interactions but this is just
43:18 - an idea just to give you
43:20 - so that you can uh you know play with it
43:22 - and see what you can come up with
43:23 - yourself in your own sites uh animated
43:25 - button number two
43:26 - is simply just a playing with um
43:30 - playing with padding so it's a little
43:32 - bit of an illusion so it looks like this
43:33 - actually animates from the from the
43:35 - right towards the left and then the
43:37 - chevron comes in from the right
43:40 - but really it's just a play on padding
43:43 - and then some transitions and stuff so
43:45 - we'll get to that here so let's jump
43:46 - into our sandbox
43:48 - i'm just going to add my css comment
43:51 - flag so we know where we are at
43:55 - all right so we've got our animated
43:56 - buttons common flag uh let's start off
43:59 - find out the
44:00 - index file here what are these the
44:02 - classes that we use here animated
44:05 - buttons animated button one and two
44:07 - perfect
44:09 - simple
44:11 - animated button dash one
44:14 - let's start off
44:16 - position
44:17 - relative
44:19 - and then we're gonna go display
44:23 - inline block
44:27 - we're going to add some padding and then
44:29 - say
44:31 - oh 20 pixels top and bottom 40 pixels
44:34 - left and right
44:36 - font size
44:39 - let's do 1.4 rim
44:42 - and then background color
44:45 - double ob3
44:48 - b4 like that green teal blue thing color
44:53 - all right background image
44:56 - i've got a jpeg not a jpeg uh a png file
45:00 - here
45:01 - pattern.png
45:03 - it's 40x40 pixels it's just a pattern i
45:05 - got online from a siteorigin.com
45:08 - it's just a pattern
45:10 - generator website
45:13 - and i'm going to throw in a url there
45:15 - simply just grab pattern.png because
45:17 - it's in the same directory as the css
45:20 - beauty
45:21 - background size we're going to go for
45:25 - 40 pixels by 40 pixels
45:29 - the border of the
45:31 - button itself let's just go for
45:34 - solid one pixel triple five just to give
45:36 - it a little bit of
45:38 - i don't know
45:39 - definition
45:41 - color
45:42 - white
45:46 - transition
45:48 - uh we're gonna go all
45:50 - ease
45:51 - 0.3
45:53 - seconds
45:56 - and um
45:57 - now if we save that and check it out
45:59 - it's going to look like this
46:01 - you're going to have your pattern here
46:04 - but hovering doesn't do anything so
46:06 - let's go ahead and fix that so what
46:08 - we're going to do is under this animated
46:10 - button we're going to go animated button
46:13 - one uh hover
46:17 - and then we're gonna do
46:20 - animation
46:23 - animation
46:26 - and say uh well we have to call a name
46:29 - of an animation so we have to create an
46:30 - animation in a keyframe right after this
46:32 - but what we're going to do is we're
46:33 - going to call the animation loading
46:36 - button
46:38 - animation
46:40 - it's gonna go over two seconds
46:43 - it's gonna be a linear
46:44 - um
46:46 - animation so it's not gonna have like an
46:48 - ease in out it's just gonna be a linear
46:50 - movement
46:53 - and infinite never stops
46:55 - so now we need to do is create the
46:58 - keyframes so what i'm going to do here
47:00 - is
47:01 - go ahead and go down just below
47:07 - i'm going to call this
47:09 - keyframes well that's what you have to
47:11 - call it keyframes a css animation now
47:14 - you have to give it a name it's going to
47:15 - be loading button
47:16 - animation this is the name of the
47:18 - animation it can be whatever you want it
47:20 - to be
47:21 - and then
47:23 - nice and simple we're just going to say
47:24 - from and then return
47:28 - print
47:29 - curly braces here
47:31 - background
47:32 - position
47:36 - zero and 0
47:38 - and then after this we're going to go 2
47:43 - and then the background position
47:46 - is going to be 40 pixels 0.
47:50 - all right so now if we save this
47:52 - let's see what happens
47:56 - hover
47:57 - it moves beauty it looks great so and
48:01 - then you stop it stops cool
48:03 - so that is the loading button animation
48:05 - for number one
48:07 - and now what we're gonna do is i'm gonna
48:10 - go below this one here
48:11 - and i'm gonna style up the
48:14 - animated button
48:16 - two
48:17 - now what we're gonna do here
48:21 - uh we're gonna basically have the same
48:23 - sort of
48:25 - base styles as animated button number
48:27 - one so i'm just gonna copy
48:30 - everything here
48:33 - paste it in
48:34 - but i am going to
48:37 - not have the
48:39 - pattern we don't need the pattern it's
48:41 - just going to have the color
48:44 - now if i save this let's check it out it
48:45 - should look pretty much the same
48:47 - cool this one has animation this one
48:49 - doesn't okay
48:51 - and now we're gonna do is
48:53 - we're going to
48:55 - create that
48:56 - uh chevron that pops in on the right so
49:01 - we need to
49:02 - declare after this animated button dash
49:06 - two
49:08 - and this will be after
49:11 - the pseudo element position is absolute
49:15 - top fifty percent is where we're going
49:17 - to position it
49:18 - so in the center
49:20 - and from the right
49:21 - uh we could just do like you could do
49:23 - any measurement it could be 20 pixels it
49:25 - could be you know one m i'm going to do
49:28 - 0.6 m
49:31 - and
49:32 - we're going to say content
49:35 - now this is where you want to put the
49:36 - content of the
49:38 - what you want to appear so we can have
49:40 - it be text we can say hi
49:42 - and then the letters
49:44 - you know h and i will pop in
49:46 - but we want it to be the chevron so um i
49:49 - just copy to chevron into my clipboard
49:52 - you can do an arrow you can do any you
49:55 - know you can
49:56 - you could just do like this you know you
49:58 - could do whatever it is you want but uh
50:00 - if you want the chevron in the final css
50:02 - you could just go down to uh line 300ish
50:05 - and then copy the chevron and paste it
50:07 - into here
50:09 - all right
50:10 - and and then after that we're going to
50:13 - transition
50:15 - all
50:18 - ease 0.3 seconds and now let's see what
50:21 - this does so far so it shows up here
50:25 - so 50
50:26 - apparently doesn't quite get in the
50:28 - right position so we can play with the
50:31 - top over here in the code editor and do
50:33 - something like 30 and that will bring it
50:35 - up a little bit to make it look like
50:37 - it's in the center there we go that'll
50:40 - do
50:41 - and now we want to do is set the opacity
50:45 - to
50:46 - zero we don't want it to appear at first
50:48 - we want it to be totally invisible
50:50 - and now what we want to do is when we
50:53 - hover
50:55 - we want to shift this text
50:57 - over to the left so we'll do that by
50:59 - removing some left padding
51:01 - adding some right padding so it looks
51:04 - like
51:04 - um
51:06 - so it looks like the width of the button
51:07 - stays the same just the text shifts over
51:10 - and because we have a transition it will
51:12 - glide over rather than jump over
51:15 - and
51:16 - we'll have the chevron appear in uh with
51:19 - opacity 100 or 1 for 100
51:23 - so let's uh go below here
51:26 - and simply say
51:29 - uh animated
51:32 - button number two
51:34 - hover and we're going to do something
51:36 - like
51:37 - padding
51:39 - and 20 pixels
51:41 - 60 pixels on the right which is 20
51:42 - pixels more than usual
51:44 - 20 on the bottom and then 20 on the left
51:48 - which is
51:49 - um
51:50 - i believe 20 pixels less than usual so
51:53 - 60s actually it's normally 20 40 20 40.
51:56 - so we're doing 20 60 20 20. so it's
51:59 - going to give the illusion of the same
52:01 - width but the text sliding over
52:04 - and
52:06 - what we're going to do now is add in
52:08 - that
52:09 - after pseudo element
52:12 - so animated
52:14 - button two
52:15 - hover and then
52:17 - the after pseudo element
52:19 - it's going to be right we're going to
52:21 - move it in from the right we're going to
52:22 - change it to something like 1.2 m rather
52:25 - than 0.6 m
52:28 - so double the
52:30 - the distance
52:31 - and then opacity will be one
52:34 - save that let's check it out let's hover
52:36 - over that button
52:38 - boom look at that it slides over it
52:40 - looks like
52:42 - the chevron is sliding in and the text
52:44 - is sliding over to accommodate it and
52:46 - that's the illusion we're giving but
52:47 - really what's happening is that we're
52:48 - changing the padding on the left and the
52:50 - right i'm making the chevron appear
52:53 - just by
52:55 - changing those measurements but because
52:57 - we have transition
52:58 - it's actually animating those padding
53:01 - adjustments giving the illusion that
53:03 - we're sliding the text over and sliding
53:05 - in the chevron from thin air so it's
53:08 - pretty cool effect and then this one is
53:09 - that sliding
53:11 - background pattern all right so now
53:12 - we're going to coat up these toggle
53:14 - switch ui buttons now i want to show you
53:15 - something a little interesting about
53:16 - this these buttons are different or
53:18 - these switches are different than the
53:20 - previous examples these up here are just
53:23 - buttons so we're so we're actually using
53:25 - button tags let me show you here in the
53:26 - html
53:28 - right here you can see all these
53:29 - examples are actually button tags
53:31 - whereas down here in the toggle switch
53:33 - ui buttons we're actually using
53:35 - a labels wrapping the entire thing then
53:37 - we have an input
53:38 - and then a span
53:40 - so this input is a checkbox input
53:43 - and we're using that to toggle we're
53:45 - going to be using that to tell css you
53:47 - know when the check box is toggled to
53:48 - checked and unchecked and so let's go
53:50 - back over here to the browser and if i
53:52 - go up to the sand box you're going to
53:54 - see toggle switch ui buttons so they're
53:56 - actually just
53:57 - check boxes so this one's the click me
54:00 - to activate one and this one is just the
54:01 - toggle so we're going to be using css to
54:04 - manipulate the
54:06 - the view
54:07 - of this checkbox into an actual switch
54:11 - this is what's cool about css3 is you
54:12 - could do really cool things like this
54:14 - you could take an element itself and
54:16 - completely uh transform it into
54:18 - something totally different to serve the
54:20 - purpose of your website or your
54:22 - application so let's jump into our code
54:25 - editor again we're going to go to our
54:26 - sandbox
54:27 - and let's go right to the bottom here
54:30 - below our last bit of code animated
54:32 - buttons i'm going to put a new
54:34 - css comment up here this is the toggle
54:37 - switch ui buttons
54:38 - okay and now let's get started we're
54:41 - going to start off with the toggle
54:43 - buttons now the classes that we're using
54:45 - here jump into our html you're going to
54:47 - see if i go up here
54:49 - right here toggle
54:51 - classes toggle one
54:54 - toggle one input and toggle one button
54:56 - and then toggle two uses the same naming
54:57 - conventions just with toggle two
54:59 - all right so let's jump in here we're
55:01 - gonna start off and say toggle dash one
55:03 - and let's
55:04 - we're gonna start off because this is
55:06 - not a button it's not grabbing the
55:09 - helvetica font family that we've been
55:11 - using it's falling back to the body's
55:12 - font family which is like roboto or
55:14 - something so we're going to change the
55:15 - font family and override that to
55:18 - a simple helvetica ariel and then sans
55:20 - serif just a nice and simple font stack
55:23 - uh display inline block we're going to
55:25 - need to use that vertical align top this
55:27 - is just some housekeeping right here
55:30 - margin 0 oops 0 15 pixels zero zero save
55:34 - that if i go over here to my browser um
55:37 - you're going to see it just kind of went
55:38 - a little bit wonky uh you know this
55:40 - one's now lined up to the top that's
55:42 - what we want we want everything to be
55:43 - consistent so that when we're working
55:45 - we're working across all the browsers
55:47 - from a similar state whereas
55:50 - when i don't have vertical line top and
55:52 - the margins and the display in line
55:53 - blocks some browsers interpret you know
55:55 - default checkbox
55:57 - style in different ways so we want to
56:00 - remove those inconsistencies and kind of
56:02 - start from the same place that's what we
56:04 - just did there back to our code editor
56:06 - now let's go below that
56:08 - all we're going to do here is we're
56:09 - going to tab in one and i'm going to say
56:11 - toggle one now i'm going to select so
56:14 - double underscore input that's the css
56:17 - class that we used
56:19 - and all i'm going to say is display none
56:21 - so i want to remove that input
56:22 - altogether i don't want to see it
56:24 - because now what i want to do is below
56:27 - that so that will make that input
56:29 - disappear what i want to do now is
56:31 - select the toggle dash 1
56:33 - button so
56:35 - that's actually the span tag that's a
56:38 - sibling of the input
56:41 - this is where the magic happens we're
56:42 - going to style that up to look like a
56:44 - toggle switch so we're going to go
56:46 - position whoops
56:48 - position relative
56:50 - we're going to say display inline block
56:53 - we're going to go font size 14
56:56 - pixels
56:57 - uh or actually let's be better about
56:58 - that one ram because that's the default
57:00 - root body size 14 pixels i believe
57:03 - line height
57:04 - 20 pixels
57:06 - text transform
57:08 - uh we want that to be upper case
57:12 - and
57:13 - backgroundcolor
57:15 - let's do something like
57:17 - f2395a
57:21 - and then the border we're going to do
57:22 - solid one pixel
57:24 - seam
57:24 - uh value is up here
57:27 - border okay now we're doing color white
57:30 - we're going to do the width of the
57:32 - switch itself is going to be 80 pixels
57:35 - height is 30 pixels we want that to be
57:37 - hard-coded
57:39 - transition i'm gonna do
57:41 - um
57:42 - all
57:45 - point 0.3 seconds and then ease just
57:47 - something simple and if you want you can
57:49 - do browser prefixes for that you can
57:52 - also check out the can i use website at
57:55 - the bottom of all each lesson there's a
57:56 - link there to the can i use website
57:58 - where you could type in the css property
58:00 - you want to see
58:01 - if that's
58:03 - cross browser compatible and what
58:05 - different prefixes you need to use but
58:06 - i'm just going to use the default one
58:08 - because whatever
58:11 - and the cursor i don't need to do that i
58:13 - did that default already i believe nope
58:15 - this is a span so i need to do cursor
58:16 - pointer because the span tag doesn't do
58:18 - a default cursor uh mario hand this one
58:21 - with the glove
58:23 - i don't know if that was offensive to
58:24 - somebody but um we want to make it look
58:26 - like a button so we we need the
58:28 - interaction to behave like a button
58:29 - which gives us the mario hand
58:32 - mario glove
58:34 - cursor pointer okay that should just
58:36 - really be cursor mario
58:38 - glove you know what i mean pointer okay
58:41 - enough about that
58:43 - okay so now what if we just pop over
58:45 - here to the browser check out what we
58:46 - got so far so now we got the background
58:47 - of that switch so let's keep going back
58:50 - here in the code editor now what we're
58:52 - going to do is select the
58:53 - toggle one
58:55 - button
58:56 - before sudo element we're going to
58:58 - create
58:59 - something here we're going to create
59:00 - something out of nothing out of thin air
59:03 - position absolute
59:04 - uh when you're when you're working with
59:05 - a pseudo element you want it to appear
59:07 - you need to absolutely position it you
59:08 - need to give it a content uh which we're
59:10 - going to get to so let's go
59:13 - uh well content let's make it say
59:16 - off we want it to say off
59:19 - a lot of the time we'll just do an empty
59:20 - string but let's just say off or we're
59:22 - gonna go display inline block i'm gonna
59:24 - go height 20 pixels
59:27 - padding zero and three pixels on the
59:29 - left and the right
59:30 - background color we want it to be white
59:32 - so we can see it on that kind of uh that
59:34 - that salmony color not farm salmon fresh
59:37 - salmon there's a difference
59:40 - color is going to be the f2 it's going
59:42 - to be that f2395a
59:46 - the salmony color we already did the
59:47 - content let's do transition is going to
59:49 - be
59:51 - uh all
59:52 - 0.3 seconds ease
59:56 - and now let's save it and see what we
59:58 - got let's see what we can see
60:00 - all right so here is in the browser you
60:02 - can see the off it's right there it's
60:03 - not centered so we're going to center
60:04 - that just by doing some positioning just
60:06 - to roughly center it so let's do that
60:09 - after position i like doing my
60:11 - top
60:12 - six pixel right after the position
60:14 - because it's related and then left 40
60:16 - pixels because it's off i want it to be
60:18 - far over to the right so let's see where
60:20 - that puts it
60:21 - perfect almost dead center it's a lit
60:24 - looks like it could maybe do like top
60:25 - five pixels over here now let's go back
60:27 - to the browsers check it out
60:29 - that looks a bit better to me cool so
60:31 - off the off switch is there it doesn't
60:33 - work yet but it will
60:35 - uh so now what we want to do is
60:38 - this
60:39 - when i touch this this element
60:42 - is a span tag but what i want to be able
60:45 - to do is when i click it when i click it
60:47 - with my mouse
60:48 - i want it to
60:50 - well here let's go to our index
60:52 - what's going to happen is when i click
60:54 - on the label because see how the label
60:58 - here is wrapping everything
61:00 - because we're using the four
61:02 - attribute here it's looking for for
61:04 - toggle one which is the id toggle one so
61:06 - it's looking for the input which is
61:07 - hidden but it still will interact
61:10 - normally so when i click on the label
61:12 - it's going to
61:14 - toggle that input because of this four
61:16 - attribute connecting it to the id right
61:18 - here
61:20 - so that means when i'm clicking this
61:21 - label the input is still the checkbox is
61:23 - toggling from on to off
61:25 - css can access that can find out if the
61:30 - input the checkbox is being toggled on
61:32 - and off and then we can manipulate the
61:34 - style
61:35 - based on if it's on or to off this is
61:38 - where the magic happens so let's go back
61:39 - to the sandbox
61:40 - and what we're going to do now
61:43 - is we're going to say
61:46 - toggle one
61:48 - input
61:50 - checked
61:51 - so it's going to match
61:54 - it's going to basically
61:56 - style the checked version so this is
61:58 - selecting the checked version
62:00 - of the
62:02 - of the input of the checkbox but i don't
62:04 - actually want to style that
62:06 - checkbox because i can't see it i want
62:08 - to select
62:09 - its sibling
62:11 - it's direct sibling immediately after it
62:14 - which is the span tag so we use that
62:16 - with the
62:17 - adjacent sibling
62:19 - selector it's a combinator so it
62:20 - combines it allows me to look for the
62:23 - input that's checked
62:25 - but select its direct sibling which is
62:28 - going to be the toggle dash one
62:31 - underscore button
62:32 - so i'm selecting that
62:35 - but only if this is check
62:37 - see what's happening there i'm going to
62:39 - say background color
62:41 - or our background i'm going to change it
62:42 - to 0 0 b 3 b 4
62:45 - and the border i'm going to change to
62:47 - solid one pixel the same color
62:51 - now
62:53 - when i save that let's see what happens
62:55 - when i click
62:56 - see how change in the background color
62:58 - so
62:59 - when it's checked
63:01 - the checkbox is checked it is changing
63:03 - the background color
63:04 - and now it's not checked
63:06 - now all i need to do is have that
63:09 - this switch change to on to move over to
63:11 - the left so back in our code editor we
63:12 - can do that really easily by selecting
63:14 - the toggle one input
63:16 - checked
63:18 - the adjacent sibling selector we're
63:21 - going to select toggle one
63:23 - button but the before pseudo element the
63:26 - one that is
63:29 - this one right here this before selector
63:30 - we're going to select that
63:32 - when this is checked and we're going to
63:34 - modify the style so we're going to
63:35 - change the position to left 5 pixels
63:37 - rather than 40
63:39 - and we're going to say content is going
63:41 - to change to on rather than off and the
63:44 - color
63:45 - of the text is going to be zero zero b
63:47 - three b four
63:48 - save that now watch the magic here in
63:51 - the browser
63:52 - click the toggle switch bam slides over
63:54 - just like that the position content and
63:56 - color change turn it off slides back
63:59 - over just like that beauty looks really
64:01 - really good i might even change the
64:03 - position here just like a little bit of
64:04 - a detail uh let's do left i don't know
64:07 - 38 see what that looks like
64:10 - that looks better to me all right now
64:12 - let's go to this next toggle switch ui
64:15 - button right here the click me to
64:16 - activate one uh what we're gonna do here
64:19 - it's a similar it's essentially the same
64:21 - mark at the same htm markup so you can
64:22 - see here when i click on the label it
64:25 - toggles the checkbox which is what we're
64:27 - going to use in css3 to to kind of
64:29 - manipulate the visual so over here in a
64:32 - code editor let's go down to sandbox css
64:35 - and let's keep coding
64:36 - the next toggle button so the class is
64:38 - toggle dash 2
64:40 - and let's just do some housekeeping so
64:42 - font family helvetica
64:46 - ariel sans serif and then we're going to
64:48 - do the font size is going to be let's do
64:51 - one rim
64:53 - actually let's make it smaller let's do
64:54 - 0.8 rem make it small a little bit a
64:57 - little bit smaller display inline block
65:00 - and then we're going to do vertical
65:01 - align
65:02 - it's going to be
65:04 - top margin 0 5
65:07 - 15 pixel 0 0
65:09 - and then let's keep going so and under
65:12 - toggle 2 tab it in one just for
65:14 - organization
65:15 - toggle
65:17 - 2 double underscore input
65:19 - now we're going to select that actual
65:21 - input this is the checkbox input and
65:23 - we're going to hide that display none we
65:25 - don't want to see it
65:26 - and then under that we're going to do
65:28 - toggle dash 2 double underscore button
65:30 - now we're selecting that span tag that
65:32 - is the adjacent sibling to the input
65:36 - we're going to do position relative
65:38 - we're going to do display inline block
65:41 - line height
65:42 - 20 pixels should do the trick
65:45 - text
65:46 - transform
65:47 - upper case
65:49 - background is gonna be white
65:51 - uh we're gonna change the color to
65:54 - aaa
65:55 - and the border is gonna be solid one
65:58 - pixel triple c
66:02 - heading let's do 5 pixels in the top 10
66:04 - on the right 5 on the bottom 30 on the
66:06 - left you'll see why in a moment
66:08 - and then transition we're going to do
66:09 - the same we've been doing for all of
66:11 - them is all 0.3 seconds and then just
66:15 - ease
66:16 - cursor pointer because this is a span
66:19 - tag we need to we need it to behave like
66:21 - a button so we need the mario
66:23 - the mario glove save that let's check
66:25 - out what it looks like in the browser
66:28 - click me to activate cool beautiful very
66:30 - simple kind of white it's got that
66:32 - thin hairline on the outside
66:34 - 30 pixels on the left side of padding
66:36 - this is going to going to allow us to
66:37 - create a little uh element there to just
66:40 - make it look a little bit more
66:41 - interesting so maybe down here i'll show
66:43 - you we've got a little
66:44 - square we're gonna play with that
66:47 - okay so back here in the code editor
66:49 - let's uh let's go
66:52 - toggle to
66:54 - button before pseudoelement and we're
66:56 - going to position absolute top 10 pixels
67:01 - left 10 pixels
67:03 - and we're going to do display inline
67:06 - block
67:08 - we're going to say
67:10 - width is 10 pixels
67:12 - height is 10 pixels
67:15 - the background will be triple c
67:18 - content is going to be just an empty
67:19 - string so that we can actually see the
67:21 - before pseudo element and the transition
67:23 - is going to be all 0.3 seconds ease save
67:27 - that let's see what it looks like here
67:28 - in the browser just a simple square
67:30 - let's do something more interesting and
67:31 - make it a circle so all we got to do
67:33 - here is
67:34 - just add in the css border radius 100
67:38 - alternatively you could do 10 pixels
67:39 - because we know the fixed width and
67:41 - height but i just like 100
67:43 - because if we change the
67:45 - the width and the height of the element
67:46 - then the border radius 100 will cover
67:48 - our bases that's going to give us a nice
67:50 - circle over here in the browser
67:52 - beauty i like it all right and now what
67:55 - we're going to do is go back to our code
67:56 - editor below that
67:59 - we're going to style up the
68:01 - we're going to select the checked
68:03 - state of the input because we click that
68:05 - label it turns on the check box we're
68:08 - going to select that but we're going to
68:09 - select it's with the adjacent sibling
68:12 - selector we're going to select the
68:14 - the span tag that is the adjacent
68:16 - sibling so that we can style it so we're
68:18 - going to do toggle dash 2
68:20 - uh input
68:22 - this is the checked state
68:25 - and then the adjacent sibling selector
68:28 - toggle dash two
68:29 - button
68:30 - and then the before pseudo element we're
68:32 - selecting this thing right here
68:35 - when the check box has been checked
68:38 - and we're going to style that up by
68:40 - saying the background is going to change
68:42 - to double o
68:44 - b3b4
68:47 - the border color is going to change to
68:49 - the same color
68:52 - and the color of the text will be white
68:56 - and let's save the actually no not the
68:59 - before we're not styling this yet just
69:02 - the button itself so save that so we got
69:04 - the input checked the toggle to button
69:06 - span tag so let's see what happens over
69:08 - here in our browser
69:10 - so click it changes the background color
69:12 - the font
69:13 - uh the font color the background and the
69:15 - border color
69:17 - perfect go back to your code editor one
69:19 - last thing one last little bit of css
69:22 - toggle dash two
69:24 - input
69:25 - the checked state of that input
69:28 - adjacent sibling selector
69:30 - toggle to button
69:32 - now we're selecting the board before
69:34 - pseudo element and we're just going to
69:35 - say background color is going to change
69:37 - to white now let's see what that is
69:40 - that's that little circle that we
69:41 - created go back to your browser click it
69:44 - changes to white
69:46 - and then goes back to gray white gray so
69:48 - those are your buttons there we go we
69:50 - did a lot of css three there we did the
69:52 - facebook style buttons we did the 3d
69:54 - buttons like that the gradient border
69:56 - buttons
69:57 - the animated buttons with the background
69:59 - moving and then that kind of
70:01 - manipulating the padding and doing some
70:02 - transitions we did the toggle switches
70:05 - and uh this toggle switch here so
70:07 - a nice little intro to css3 doing
70:09 - something that's practical that you can
70:11 - use in your websites right now so hope
70:14 - you enjoyed day one i know that was a
70:16 - lot to cover hang tight for day two
70:18 - tomorrow i'll catch you there we're
