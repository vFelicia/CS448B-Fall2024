00:00 - in this video i'll be introducing
00:01 - another algebraic law of sets the
00:04 - distributive law
00:05 - the distributive law is simply saying
00:08 - that
00:08 - the set and operation will be
00:11 - distributed over another set in
00:13 - operation for instance a intersection b
00:16 - union c
00:17 - equals a intersection b union a
00:20 - intersection c
00:21 - so i thought it might be helpful to use
00:23 - uh venn diagrams for the
00:26 - conceptual idea of this and then i'll do
00:29 - a separate video on the actual
00:30 - definition
00:31 - so if we look at a here and we separate
00:35 - a
00:37 - and then we decide to
00:39 - separate b union c
00:45 - then when we actually go to find the
00:47 - union or the intersection of these two
00:49 - regions it's easy to see that it is this
00:52 - region
00:55 - so hopefully for the purposes of
00:57 - equality this region here will match
01:00 - this region here
01:01 - so let's get right to it we have a
01:04 - intersection b so we have the set a and
01:05 - the set b so that means that a
01:07 - intersection b is going to be this
01:09 - region here
01:11 - and we have to also find a intersection
01:13 - c
01:15 - so that's this region
01:17 - and if we take the union of those two
01:19 - regions then we're left with
01:22 - all this jazz
01:25 - so it looks like they are in fact equal
01:28 - but to be more rigorous we'll uh revisit
01:31 - the actual definition of the
01:33 - intersection in the unions in the next
01:35 - video
