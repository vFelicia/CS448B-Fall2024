00:00 - learn how to use the pi qt5 framework to
00:02 - create a modern music player Pi qt5
00:05 - makes it easy to create guey
00:07 - applications with python in this course
00:09 - Thomas Burns will teach you how to
00:10 - create a music player that features a
00:13 - beautiful and modern user interface
00:15 - playlist and favorite songs
00:17 - functionality custom context menus for
00:20 - different pages and a background
00:22 - slideshow for every song so let's start
00:25 - learning hello everyone my name is
00:28 - Thomas and in this video you and I are
00:30 - going to build the most advanced and
00:32 - modern python music player you can
00:34 - currently find on YouTube Let us look at
00:37 - what you're going to build because it
00:38 - looks like I'm bragging about it so
00:43 - much this is what we are going to build
00:45 - you can see that is the interface is
00:47 - fully customized and it doesn't have the
00:51 - default title bar it's a custom title
00:53 - bar this is where the song that is
00:56 - currently playing will have the name
00:58 - displayed and then the path to that
00:59 - particular song you can add song to to
01:02 - your favorit or a particular playlist
01:04 - that you have created this is the volume
01:07 - control which I will like to bring down
01:08 - to about 20 now and these are playback
01:12 - controls the you can see the beautiful
01:14 - hover effects that each of them gives on
01:15 - their H and this one uh is the loop one
01:19 - song and then this is the random play or
01:22 - the shuffle this is our music
01:24 - slider and then this is the default song
01:29 - list page
01:30 - that is when we Lo load songs this is
01:32 - where they will come and then this
01:34 - button will help us to add songs this
01:36 - one helps us to delete and then this one
01:38 - helps us to delete all but if you look
01:40 - down here you can see that there are
01:41 - some three boms here what they do is to
01:43 - navigate between several pages in the
01:45 - application so if I click on playlist
01:47 - now you see that the playlist page opens
01:52 - and then you have some playlist here
01:54 - that I created you can actually create
01:56 - your own or remove selected or remove
01:58 - all I think at this point I we have to
02:00 - remove all playlist and then we create
02:03 - some from scratch if I come to favorite
02:05 - 2 I have some songs in favorit that I
02:08 - can actually click and play so if I
02:09 - click on this one and then hit
02:17 - play so the song is playing and then the
02:19 - slider is also moving accordingly let me
02:21 - stop it and oh not zero so let's come to
02:27 - the playlist side and then let's see if
02:29 - you want to create a new playlist let me
02:31 - just
02:34 - say new one and then I can right click
02:39 - on it and then uh see load selected but
02:42 - it doesn't have any song so but if I
02:45 - double click on it sorry this one went
02:46 - to the second screen if I double click
02:48 - on the playlist it pops up uh small
02:51 - window pops up which should show me all
02:53 - the songs in the playlist you see that
02:54 - currently there was no song in the
02:55 - playlist but if I come to song list and
02:58 - let's load some song
03:00 - songs let me load this my songs here and
03:04 - then I can choose to play it it will
03:05 - work as you have seen and if you also
03:08 - noticed I when I click to play a new
03:10 - song the background picture Chang so
03:13 - this application has background slide
03:15 - show for every song that you play and
03:18 - that is a very very cool feature that
03:20 - you are going to build so if I press on
03:22 - the next check it see that the
03:24 - background picture will change to a new
03:26 - picture I press next next next next and
03:30 - automatically knows how to go to the
03:31 - first song when it reaches the end of
03:33 - the list and that is also another very
03:35 - cool feature but if I want to add this
03:37 - particular song to playlist that is
03:39 - playing this one is that is highlighted
03:40 - I just click on add to playlist
03:42 - currently there's only one playlist that
03:44 - I have new one so I click on it and then
03:46 - okay it looks like nothing has happened
03:49 - but let me just pause this song and then
03:50 - come here the playlist when I double
03:53 - click I don't know why this one always
03:54 - comes to the second screen when I double
03:57 - click you see that that song Raising Me
03:58 - Higher that I added has been uh is
04:02 - showing here so we know that that song
04:04 - is in that particular playlist and if I
04:07 - also decide to add the song that is
04:09 - playing to favorite currently it is not
04:11 - playing let me play it again see that
04:13 - it's Raising Me Higher that it's playing
04:15 - it's not part of our favorites if I
04:16 - click on out to favorites I see it here
04:19 - in real time so this is what we are
04:20 - going to build if you are excited about
04:23 - it just hit the like button and then
04:25 - share it to your friends who who might
04:26 - be
04:27 - [Music]
04:28 - interested
04:30 - okay so let us get
04:34 - coding before we start I want you to
04:37 - visit this GitHub repository which the
04:39 - link will be in the description below
04:41 - you will see that there are two branches
04:43 - the starter and then the main the main
04:45 - will have the complete application this
04:47 - starter has the files that we need to
04:49 - get started be sure that you're on the
04:52 - starter branch and then clone the
04:54 - repository into any editor of your
04:56 - choice I'll be using py Chon for this
04:57 - tutorial as you saw so so any editor of
05:00 - your choice and then let's get
05:05 - started so when you clone it this is
05:07 - what you see the file and folder
05:08 - structure here the ETS folder just
05:10 - contains folder for the background
05:13 - images and the images to that have been
05:15 - used in the app or the say like the
05:18 - icons themselves also and then you see
05:21 - here that there is a maini file and then
05:25 - the music. there's the r and then the
05:28 - re. QRC so this tutorial is targeted for
05:32 - beginners also so if you are beginner to
05:34 - the PT framework is also a right place
05:36 - for you to be and I will explain
05:39 - everything uh as you need to know so
05:42 - let's say so is the directory where my
05:43 - folder uh my project is sorry and if I
05:46 - want to open the terminal
05:52 - here okay so this is a terminal I'll
05:55 - will be using the windows terminal the
05:56 - get Bash one if you don't have this
06:00 - option that says open in terminal
06:01 - probably you have not installed the
06:02 - windows terminal you can go ahead and
06:04 - install it or if you're on Windows you
06:05 - can just click this address bar and type
06:08 - CMD that should open command promt for
06:11 - you in that particular
06:14 - directory and so that should also do but
06:17 - I prefer this terminal so that is what
06:19 - I'll go with the only requirement after
06:22 - having python installed is to have pt5
06:26 - and then pt5 tools installed so if you
06:29 - do pip list whether you are using a
06:31 - virtual environment or you using your
06:33 - default python if you do pip list you
06:35 - should see that
06:37 - pyqt5 and then pt5 tools are all
06:41 - installed great if you don't have it
06:44 - it's quite simple you can just do pip
06:47 - install and then Pi kt5 please check the
06:52 - casing is very necessary you leave a
06:54 - space and then Pi qt5 D
06:58 - tools
07:00 - you see that I have it so it says
07:02 - requirement already satisfied so let's
07:04 - clear up this
07:06 - thing
07:10 - and let me come back here you see the
07:12 - main. file that is the UR file that
07:16 - we'll be
07:17 - using the reason we install the P qt5
07:19 - tools is that so that we get access to
07:21 - the QT designer that we can use for the
07:25 - designing of our UI there are two
07:27 - options for even for the UI for you to
07:29 - Cho from and I'll show you and I will
07:31 - tell you the difference very soon but if
07:33 - you are looking to learn more on how to
07:35 - use the QT designer and even PT itself
07:37 - you can check out my channel uh that is
07:39 - Tom code based I have a great tutorials
07:42 - on pyqt5 and other Stacks that you might
07:46 - be interested in especially if you are
07:48 - in today's software development
07:51 - staff okay so the QT designer usually
07:56 - some time ago I used to type
07:58 - designer
08:01 - Des exe or without the exe and I was
08:04 - able to open it straight from my
08:05 - terminal but now it doesn't work I don't
08:07 - really know why what I did some
08:09 - configuration that I forgotten so I will
08:11 - show you how to get access to the QT
08:13 - designer after installing it with the
08:15 - p5- tools you would want to go to where
08:19 - your default python where your python is
08:22 - so if you installed it on your default
08:24 - python like I did I have it on my
08:27 - default python I'm not using a
08:29 - environment then you want to go to where
08:33 - your python is installed on your
08:36 - PC so if I should open a new window here
08:40 - you let me paste this address this is
08:42 - where my python is usually it will be at
08:45 - uh local dxc users and then your your
08:48 - username mine is Tomy and then updata
08:51 - local programs python for the windows
08:53 - people uh if you Mar or Lup I think it
08:55 - should be easier also to locate where
08:58 - your python was installed if you have
09:00 - problems with that you can do a quick
09:02 - Google search and then you get to this
09:04 - place where I am I only have one version
09:05 - of python 3.8 so you just click on that
09:08 - one and then you come to this place
09:10 - where you see um lib and those one let's
09:12 - just click on the
09:14 - lib the one with the capital L there
09:17 - there are two there okay the one even
09:18 - has an S but this one is only Li and
09:22 - then from this place you come to sit
09:23 - packages when you come to sit packages
09:25 - come to qt5 applications and then from
09:28 - here go to QT and then go to the bin
09:31 - folder here you see a couple of files we
09:34 - are not even interested in any of them
09:35 - what we need is the designer. exe this
09:38 - one you double click
09:40 - it and then it will open this interface
09:43 - for you so what you want to do to save
09:45 - yourself from coming through all these
09:47 - stress to open the designer is that you
09:49 - can right click on it on your tax bar
09:51 - you can't see my tax bar the moment but
09:54 - if you right click on it you will have
09:55 - the option to pin it from task bar you
09:57 - see that mine has already been pinned
09:59 - the taskar if I W pin it uh then I can
10:01 - right click on it and pin it to the
10:03 - taskbar again so so that to be on the
10:06 - task bar anytime I need it I can close
10:08 - it uh now and anytime I need it I can
10:12 - just open it from my txk bar I think I
10:13 - didn't pin it back so let me open it
10:15 - from
10:17 - here okay
10:19 - pin and then let me make sure that it's
10:22 - pinned okay so if I close it now I will
10:25 - not open it from this folder let me
10:27 - close it and then open open it from my
10:29 - taxk bar so that I will not go through
10:31 - so much stress again so after that you
10:34 - have this opened in your task bar what
10:37 - we want to do is
10:39 - to open the UI file and then do the
10:42 - inspection
10:44 - so here you go to open because you
10:47 - actually want to open a file I'll paste
10:49 - in the address to where the file is that
10:51 - is where my project is so that is the
10:53 - address to where this uh folder is that
10:56 - is what I've opened so let's first
10:58 - inspect the the
11:00 - main and then this is it uh in QT
11:03 - designer if you are new to this um this
11:06 - shouldn't be so difficult to graas it's
11:08 - just that the widgets are here what when
11:11 - we say widgets in pi qt5 or QT is just
11:14 - the other the things that you see used
11:16 - to build your app so the buttons the
11:19 - slider and everything that you see on
11:21 - this screen is a widget the test and all
11:24 - and this is where our object inspector
11:26 - is we can look at all the widget we have
11:27 - added the names and
11:29 - uh the classes of each of them and the
11:32 - property editor is where we edit the
11:34 - properties of any particular so if I
11:36 - pick the song list withget is I can
11:38 - addit the properties of that and then uh
11:42 - we have the resource browser that
11:43 - contains the if we have any resource
11:46 - file yes we do have one for this project
11:48 - and that is what is also the
11:51 - KC this one re. QRC and I really
11:55 - encourage you if you are pqt use pqt
11:59 - just I encourage you to use the resource
12:01 - file instead of just the raw path to the
12:04 - images or the icons that you use because
12:07 - it comes with so many advantages one of
12:09 - it is that if you are even on a
12:10 - different operating system it to be
12:12 - easier to run the application without
12:14 - any errors and then if you are also
12:17 - packaging it you don't actually even
12:18 - need to add the images to it you can do
12:21 - away with the images and then once you
12:23 - convert it to the uh resource file to a
12:26 - python file you have to if you can even
12:29 - delete all the images if you want to and
12:32 - then you app will still be running okay
12:36 - so the resource file was just if you
12:38 - don't know how to create it you can just
12:41 - click on this pencil and then it will
12:43 - bring up the resource file it
12:44 - automatically picked it from the
12:46 - directory where it is just I just added
12:48 - the images that are in this images
12:51 - folder here uh let me cancel this
12:54 - operation so I just added them so that
12:56 - we can reference them in our application
12:58 - there is also some actions that I wrote
13:01 - Because we will along the line if you
13:04 - saw the demo I right clicked on uh
13:07 - something in the playlist and the popup
13:09 - came so the context menu as it is called
13:11 - we using actions to create them so these
13:14 - are the actions that are in the
13:15 - application the action to play pause and
13:18 - all the other default stuff that music
13:20 - players do there is also the signal and
13:23 - Slot editor where I've created a few
13:24 - signals so if you see this one it says
13:27 - the volume down this is the volume down
13:29 - I have made it such that if it is
13:32 - moved then I want to change the volume
13:36 - label to the particular number that the
13:39 - uh so if this is moved this is a label
13:42 - on top you can see I click it you see
13:44 - that the bounding box has come and then
13:47 - it's different from the dial itself I
13:48 - just put it on top of it so what I'm
13:50 - saying here is that if the slider is
13:52 - moved this handle is moved it should get
13:56 - the value that has it has been moved to
13:58 - I set the minimum to zero and then the
14:00 - maximum to 100 as you can see here so if
14:03 - you move it it should get the value that
14:04 - you are currently on and use it to set
14:06 - the number on this label and then this
14:09 - minimize button at the top here too this
14:12 - one uh if I I said that if it is clicked
14:14 - then it will show it should show the app
14:16 - minimized if and the close btn2 if it is
14:19 - clicked it should close the app this
14:21 - ones so that we don't B ourselves
14:23 - writing extra code for them it can
14:26 - easily be done
14:27 - here so so this is the UI it has this
14:32 - title
14:33 - bar uh what we will use for a default
14:36 - title bar because you realize very soon
14:38 - enough that we need a title bar to move
14:40 - the app around and so we remove the
14:43 - default one so we have to create our own
14:45 - and it's called title frame inside of
14:47 - which there is the name m beats my
14:49 - friend called Augustin suggested it and
14:53 - so that the frame pass move our app and
14:55 - then this is the currently playing this
14:57 - is place where our song name will go
15:00 - these labels each of them when you click
15:02 - on them you see that their name is uh
15:04 - their names are here if you go ahead and
15:07 - modify this file because obviously my
15:09 - colors may not be the best and make sure
15:12 - that the names that you if you change
15:15 - the names of the labels and any of the
15:18 - widgets make sure that you keep it in
15:19 - mind because that is what we are going
15:21 - to reference to in uh pip charm when we
15:24 - are writing the code so uh just be
15:26 - careful of that and
15:29 - you see this is where the playback
15:30 - controls are the Hoover effect
15:32 - everything is done with stylesheets if I
15:34 - right click on one of them and go to
15:35 - change stylesheet you see that I can add
15:38 - CSS to this particular widget that is
15:41 - what makes this QT so powerful one of
15:43 - the things let me see that makes CT very
15:46 - powerful you can add CSS styling to any
15:49 - of the widgets you see this colors they
15:51 - all CSS that are used so when it is
15:54 - hover just change this background color
15:56 - there and all that
15:59 - and uh if you are wondering where the
16:01 - rounded corners of the Hoover is coming
16:02 - from you see that this place there's no
16:05 - B radius there but it is inheriting from
16:07 - this parents that is is inside so that
16:09 - is very very cool so it's inheriting
16:13 - from this border radius of the
16:15 - parent and this is the slider has also
16:18 - been customized with some CSS just to
16:21 - look like this because the raw one
16:23 - doesn't look like this at all you see
16:25 - that I have to get the groove and then
16:27 - the handle if I should change any of
16:31 - these colors let me go for the group the
16:33 - alpha is 100 let me make it
16:35 - 255 so that be
16:37 - full when I click on apply so that it
16:40 - changes this color here so I obviously
16:42 - not like it this way so let me cancel
16:44 - out of it and yeah so you can choose to
16:47 - customize it as you want if you go to
16:49 - the next page of this stack widget is
16:51 - this a stack widget then you can see the
16:54 - playlist page and also the favorite page
16:57 - but the page that that you leave this
16:59 - thing on and save the file it is the
17:02 - default page that will render when you
17:04 - convert it to python code so we want to
17:06 - keep you to the song list page this
17:08 - button is the one that open files you
17:10 - see that each of them has uh when you
17:12 - come to the property editor it has it
17:15 - icon linked as a resource file so we
17:17 - just have to save the resource file and
17:20 - then uh we will be good to go the
17:23 - background image also is
17:26 - here and then the over lay is also there
17:29 - there's an overlay if you open in one of
17:32 - the images you see that the color is not
17:34 - really dark like this or at least and it
17:37 - doesn't have
17:39 - any overlay like this on it this overlay
17:41 - is also
17:43 - another picture in the files that just
17:46 - gives our apps an overlay like this it
17:48 - even factors in the title frame
17:52 - also and if I go ahead and preview this
17:57 - you will see that
17:59 - so let me preview infusion style my
18:01 - favorite you see that there's a defa
18:03 - title but this not doesn't look like the
18:05 - one you saw in the
18:08 - demo I cannot maximize
18:12 - this but in case you want to make it
18:15 - responsive that is where you use layouts
18:17 - and Frames uh all of this in pt5 the
18:23 - containers in P5 to make it responsive
18:26 - but because of the fixed size of the
18:28 - background image and the overlay image
18:31 - that has to be on the background image
18:34 - if I try to set a layout for this
18:38 - Central widget which should be the which
18:42 - should make the app responsive then it
18:45 - will just mess up everything so if I
18:48 - just show it now you that everything now
18:50 - is messed up let me just close it and
18:52 - pretend that I didn't do
18:56 - this so I can open r
18:58 - sent and then we have it back so that is
19:01 - why I couldn't make this one responsive
19:04 - and that is the reason there is another
19:05 - file in there called music. py
19:08 - music.i this one looks exactly like this
19:12 - one but doesn't have a background image
19:15 - if the background image goes off then we
19:17 - solve that issue because now I can make
19:20 - the central wiet give it a layout and if
19:23 - I go to form and then
19:25 - preview you see that I can
19:28 - maximize it uh the if I maximize it now
19:33 - you see that it's it's actually full
19:34 - screen so you can do that and maximize
19:38 - it but here you not get the background
19:41 - slid show so if you like it this way I
19:43 - think some of our icons are missing uh
19:46 - you can let's just fix them if you like
19:48 - it this way then you can of course go
19:50 - with it but if not if you want the
19:52 - background slideshow then you have to
19:53 - stick with the old UI let me fix this
19:56 - one so we can
20:00 - so where is the
20:04 - icon I'm not looking for the frame I'm
20:06 - looking for this
20:07 - one okay
20:10 - so choose
20:13 - resource I always goes to the second
20:15 - screen I can choose this one okay and we
20:18 - will use the same thing here
20:23 - also okay so it looks
20:26 - nicer okay so this changes be pushed
20:29 - probably your the stter file will not
20:31 - have it but the finished one will have
20:32 - it so if I go ahead and
20:34 - preview you see that they all there
20:36 - beautifully so depending on which one
20:39 - you want you can choose between the two
20:41 - but anyways you still have a great
20:43 - application so that is it about the C
20:45 - designer if you want more tutorials on
20:47 - that one you can check out my channel I
20:49 - have a great project that make use of KT
20:53 - designer and PT 5 uh so we can build
20:57 - those things from scratch
21:07 - okay let us now design the
21:11 - UI the UI file we use is the main. UI so
21:15 - this new one that you create I will call
21:18 - it probably test or any other name it
21:21 - will not be push to
21:23 - GitHub that is because I will delete it
21:26 - afterwards is this just to show you how
21:28 - to design the UI but this is what we use
21:30 - everything will look exactly like the
21:32 - main. UI just that we use this one and
21:35 - I'll delete that one afterwards as I
21:37 - said the purpose is to show you how to
21:39 - design the UI so let us come back to KT
21:43 - designer and in here let us make sure if
21:47 - you don't have this window come to this
21:51 - uh the new icon here make sure it's on
21:54 - Main window and then click on create
22:00 - the first thing we want to do let me
22:02 - bring this one up is to give our app a
22:07 - name so we click on the main window the
22:10 - Q main window here and come down to this
22:13 - place in the property editor you find
22:17 - window title you see that the currently
22:18 - the window Title Here is main window you
22:21 - find window title which you can call
22:26 - Advanced
22:30 - music player and that should change it
22:32 - for you you see that changes in real
22:34 - time we also have to name our class
22:38 - itself so that's one we come here the
22:40 - object name the object name so you see
22:43 - the objects and then the objects class
22:45 - so the object name should be
22:49 - UI no should be music app sorry music
22:52 - app the UI is added there automatically
22:55 - and you know that you cannot give space
22:56 - in here if you want to give a space it
22:58 - will not really allow you so that
23:00 - becomes the name of the class if you
23:02 - come back to py Cham okay when we
23:05 - convert it you get to know what this one
23:07 - is usually to add UI to it and then and
23:11 - that will be the the name of the class
23:13 - that you call in
23:15 - Python and so we want to also set the
23:19 - size of this but before then let me try
23:22 - and save
23:26 - it
23:29 - so as I said let me call this one or let
23:32 - instead of test let me call it maincore
23:35 - one that is so close and far better and
23:40 - we have all the images in that
23:41 - particular folder but before we move on
23:44 - also and resite let me let us create the
23:47 - resource file come to the resource
23:49 - browser click on this pencil icon and
23:53 - then you click on this button here to
23:55 - create a new resource file which will
23:58 - also call R
24:01 - S1 and then after that you just select
24:04 - this one and you add prefix in case your
24:08 - icons are grouped you maybe you group
24:10 - them into the categories you can use the
24:13 - prefixes to determine that but we will
24:16 - only use one prefix which will be
24:19 - IMG and once you add the prefix now you
24:23 - can come here this button and add files
24:28 - and that is where we want to go into our
24:30 - etails and then images and then select
24:34 - everything that is here and click on
24:36 - open so it will add all of them here for
24:37 - us and then we have to click okay you
24:40 - can see down here that all of them have
24:42 - been added and ready for our use great
24:46 - so the size of our application will
24:49 - be 800 by 550 so before because this one
24:55 - will not be resizable we will make the
24:57 - minimum size and the maximum size to be
25:00 - the same so that the user cannot resize
25:02 - it so that will
25:04 - be 880 sorry 880 rather by
25:09 - 550 we are doing that in light of the
25:12 - size of our background
25:19 - image now it has been Riz for us in fact
25:23 - if we preview it I can go to top here
25:25 - and preview my favorite Style
25:28 - so that I canot resize it but if you
25:31 - change the size now you can actually
25:33 - resize
25:38 - it okay the first thing is for us to add
25:42 - the background image so let us bring in
25:45 - a label so you come to this widget box
25:49 - here usually it becomes difficult to
25:50 - scroll through and find if that happens
25:52 - you can come to the top here and type in
25:54 - whatever you are looking for so if I'm
25:56 - looking for a label I type in label and
25:58 - I bring it in make sure you resize the
26:01 - label to fix the size of the the app
26:05 - like
26:11 - this and you can right click here and
26:14 - then remove status bar we don't need the
26:17 - status bar we also don't need this menu
26:19 - bar so right click at the top and then
26:21 - remove it and now when you select the
26:23 - label like this you can make sure the
26:26 - label is selected you can even see here
26:28 - so here we can now give it a name and
26:32 - the name will be
26:34 - background underscore
26:37 - image that will be the name and we will
26:40 - come down in inside the property edit
26:44 - for that background image and we'll be
26:46 - looking for pix map this pix map is what
26:49 - we used to set the an image inside the
26:52 - label so this one it will not be a
26:54 - resource we choose file for this one and
26:57 - come back by one go into the BG images
27:01 - and then choose any of these which I
27:03 - prefer the first and you will see that
27:05 - you have it in here usually it will not
27:09 - really try and fit in but you can click
27:12 - on skilled content and then you see that
27:15 - once you click on scaled content it will
27:17 - automatically fill in the available
27:20 - space and that is exactly what we are
27:22 - looking for
27:24 - great so now that we have this one we
27:27 - have to bring bring in another label on
27:29 - top of
27:33 - this make sure to resize it you may not
27:36 - really see my transform controls because
27:39 - of the screen but if you are using doing
27:43 - it at your end you see some Blue Notes
27:45 - at the edges that you can use for the
27:47 - res sizing so this one will be the BG
27:54 - overly I can actually also rename it at
27:56 - the top here you can also do it here BG
27:59 - overlay and that one to we give it a PIX
28:01 - map choose file and then the overlay is
28:05 - also part of the stuff here so you can
28:07 - choose that one too and then once again
28:09 - we click on scaled content to have a
28:12 - scale up and so now our background is
28:16 - complete the next thing is to build the
28:19 - widget at this right side that has the
28:23 - the details so that one what we can do
28:26 - is to bringing a frame so we are looking
28:30 - for a
28:34 - frame just like this and then we put it
28:42 - in or we should start building the top
28:45 - first so the okay it will still be a
28:47 - frame just that move it up and let it
28:49 - fill this black section of the BG
28:53 - overlay image because we want to use
28:55 - this part for our title frame
29:02 - okay so let's give it the proper name
29:05 - not just frame
29:06 - but let me do it the proper way not just
29:09 - frame but title
29:13 - frame that is great and inside this
29:17 - title frame we will have a label so
29:20 - let's just search it up
29:24 - label the first label let let just
29:27 - delete the text from it
29:30 - and that one will be the icon we don't
29:32 - really need it at the at the inside py
29:35 - Cham so you can choose to leave the name
29:37 - like this but if you still want to
29:38 - rename it that is completely
29:40 - fine so I'll go ahead and then
29:44 - choose but this time around I'll will
29:46 - come into the images and get this app
29:49 - icon like this so it will give me the
29:52 - app icon also which I can put somewhere
29:55 - here and then the next LEL we need is
29:58 - for the name of the application which we
30:00 - will also not need inside pyam so we can
30:05 - choose not to give it any name here you
30:07 - can just leave it at the default label
30:09 - two and then here I can type my name
30:13 - m p you can choose your name as you like
30:19 - and so we click on it make sure it's
30:22 - selected and then come to this place
30:24 - where you see
30:25 - font let's change the font size to
30:28 - something large think 15 is okay and you
30:32 - can choose to make it bold also and then
30:35 - right click on it and choose change
30:37 - Styles
30:43 - sheet that should bring up the Styles
30:45 - sheet editor this place we can if you
30:49 - want to add a resource you can add
30:51 - resource if you want to even add a
30:52 - gradient you can add a gradient but this
30:55 - place we want to add color if you want
30:57 - to add a color you can pick any of these
31:00 - colors or even pick a screen color and
31:02 - then add it but that is not what I do I
31:05 - already have the color and so I'll paste
31:08 - the color in here the color is this LGB
31:11 - code so when I apply you see that it has
31:14 - changed the color for me okay the next
31:18 - thing to do is to bring up the minimize
31:21 - and then the close buttons which we can
31:25 - those ones will not be labels those ones
31:26 - will be button so push button this
31:30 - one and you bring it in and so you can
31:33 - double click on the button to delete all
31:35 - the test and then you this one we will
31:39 - give it a name
31:42 - of
31:44 - minimize
31:47 - BTN and then we okay I think we can just
31:51 - put uh no this one we give it a px map
31:55 - we will not put the H we give it a p pix
31:57 - map so come to
31:59 - Icon and then you can choose resource
32:02 - for this
32:06 - one because of the background part it is
32:09 - difficult to get that
32:16 - one okay so that's the
32:18 - main.png I was looking for and you can
32:22 - choose to increase the icon size so if
32:25 - we go to say um
32:28 - 24 and then 24 I think that should that
32:32 - should just be okay and we will have it
32:35 - we have it then that way but you could
32:37 - see that on the finished one the
32:40 - background was not there so let us apply
32:42 - sty sheets to move that one so right
32:45 - click and then change style
32:47 - sheet and then in here we will have to
32:50 - type some CSS so we have first to get
32:52 - the class which is Q push button I I
32:57 - can't really maximize the font inside
33:00 - here uh but I just hope that you see it
33:04 - in case you don't you can have you have
33:06 - access to the file you can do the
33:08 - inspection at your end so that will be Q
33:10 - push button and
33:18 - then we can see that the
33:21 - background
33:25 - color we want to like take the
33:27 - background color off so one of the
33:29 - tricks to do that is to just give it an
33:32 - rgba we can choose to make it any color
33:35 - just that the alpha should be zero and
33:37 - you know that that one will not show the
33:39 - color at all so if you choose to make it
33:42 - white which is
33:43 - 255 255
33:48 - 255 and then we we can click on apply
33:53 - you see that it applies it and we can
33:54 - even see the minimum again the the
33:58 - sign but if we add the alpha of
34:02 - zero and click apply again you see that
34:05 - the background is gone because we are
34:06 - not showing the color at all so that is
34:09 - one of the tricks to how I did the
34:11 - background color not showing and then we
34:15 - can also bring up other things like the
34:18 - Hoover effect so I can just copy that
34:20 - one I have up there paste it down here
34:23 - but after the Q push button I just
34:27 - like CSS selector I select the Hoover
34:30 - and then when it is hoovered that one I
34:32 - will not make it zero I will make it
34:34 - like
34:37 - 130 so if I click on
34:40 - apply uh it will not work in here but
34:43 - now when I close the Star sheet and I
34:45 - hover over it you see that the style has
34:49 - been applied let's come back to our sty
34:51 - sheet and so we can also give it some
34:56 - pressed effect so that one to a push
34:59 - button and then if it is
35:05 - pressed the background color should be
35:07 - the same so by the border
35:12 - style but
35:15 - style should be
35:17 - insert and then we also want
35:20 - to make the
35:23 - color black but 100% but I don't think
35:27 - that would really work because this is
35:28 - an image if it was the text that we put
35:31 - there like The Hyphen that would have
35:32 - worked so we can skipe that but doesn't
35:35 - really it's not really needed here but
35:37 - we have to also apply a border radius so
35:39 - can say
35:40 - border
35:42 - radius of 10
35:47 - pixels and then apply it and then okay
35:50 - so when we H over it we see that
35:52 - particular border radius over there so
35:55 - what we can do now is to copy this one
35:57 - by contrl C for on Mark command C should
36:00 - do and then paste it in please make sure
36:03 - that it is still indented inside the
36:05 - title frame that is very very necessary
36:07 - but this one we will call it not
36:11 - minimize
36:12 - btn2 I think this one the name was even
36:15 - the N was double delete one from it and
36:17 - this place we call
36:19 - it close
36:24 - BTM so for the close BT and let's first
36:28 - change the
36:31 - icon choose resource and that is quit.
36:36 - PNG and that one we now have to just
36:40 - change the Styles sheet and make it
36:46 - red when it is hoovered so once again I
36:49 - have that color which is 255 for the red
36:54 - and then 20 for
36:57 - the green and then for the blue let's
36:59 - make it 12 the alpha this time around
37:02 - should be 200 and that should do and yep
37:07 - that is all that we need the background
37:11 - color I think it should be the same for
37:13 - this side also so we can just copy this
37:15 - value here and then paste it
37:20 - in
37:22 - okay so now you see that you have that
37:25 - vle effect also but we have to now try
37:28 - and bring them to the end as much as we
37:38 - can okay so our title bar is done let us
37:41 - now bring in our
37:53 - frame just position it anywhere at the
37:56 - top left left and this Frame to let's
37:59 - give it the
38:05 - Styles sorry change style
38:14 - sheet for this one we want to give it a
38:16 - background color and of course you can
38:18 - select the color from here so in this
38:20 - case I'll select the color from here but
38:22 - the alpha let's make it
38:25 - 150
38:27 - and then apply so you see that the
38:29 - background color is there and we can add
38:32 - our border radius of 10 pixels so border
38:36 - radius of 10
38:41 - pixels apply and that one too is applied
38:45 - so let us add the text inside that one
38:49 - will be a label you know there's a an
38:52 - icon and then currently playing at this
38:55 - side and then there is
38:57 - if I open up the main the main
39:01 - one where is
39:05 - it this one see there's an icon here
39:09 - that is currently playing and then the
39:12 - other one before the other ones come so
39:14 - this label this one is a label this one
39:16 - will also be a label so all these ones
39:18 - will be
39:20 - labels uh just like that
39:23 - so let us bring in a label
39:32 - we will not use it in the in Python so
39:35 - we can just choose to forget about that
39:37 - one uh but if I bring it here you can
39:40 - see that it's inheriting from the parent
39:42 - and it's also getting some background
39:45 - and all those ones so what we will do is
39:47 - that you change the sty sheet
39:49 - specifically for this label and let's
39:51 - see that the color background color even
39:56 - if whatever it for whatever it is we
39:58 - want the alpha to be zero because this
40:00 - one shouldn't have a background and then
40:03 - okay the Border radius we can leave it
40:05 - it will not really matter it will not
40:07 - even show
40:09 - so now let's bring it here and then
40:12 - select where our pix
40:16 - map we can choose a
40:18 - resource and the name is current uh I
40:23 - can't see it for I think current
40:24 - music.png so it's select that one and
40:28 - you will see that it is so large and we
40:31 - have to expand it before we see so how
40:34 - we can go fixing it I'm sure you've
40:36 - already guessed it is to click on the
40:38 - scaled content and that will scale it
40:40 - inside whatever parent it is in so we
40:43 - can put that one on this side and
40:46 - then let us just duplicate okay we Not
40:49 - Duplicate it let's bring another
40:52 - label and then call the test inside
40:56 - current
40:57 - currently
40:59 - clean okay let's resize
41:07 - it go into the stylesheet like this and
41:11 - then set the background color
41:14 - to
41:16 - Invisible okay and then let's come up
41:20 - here for the font side let's bring it
41:24 - up 15 do and then let's make it bold for
41:29 - the color also it will inherit from this
41:31 - m so I think I can just open the sty
41:34 - sheet and then copy the color for it or
41:39 - equally I can right click on it like
41:41 - this change style sheet and then for the
41:45 - color I'll pick a screen color so I'll
41:48 - pick this screen color from the B and
41:51 - then I'll give you to this one also so
41:53 - apply okay and then that's one two shows
41:57 - okay so now we have this one to at the
42:00 - top there what we need to do again
42:04 - usually sometimes it's difficult to get
42:06 - to arrange these
42:13 - things okay I think that this is this is
42:15 - okay with
42:16 - me bring it
42:25 - down
42:34 - okay so we need another label that says
42:37 - name very close to this currently
42:40 - playing so we can actually copy this and
42:43 - then paste and then come in here and
42:46 - just change this one to
42:50 - name and then I will duplicate it again
42:54 - but not now I can now change it let me
42:57 - take the board off bring the font size
42:59 - down
43:01 - to
43:02 - maybe
43:04 - 14 uh I think I need a board back okay
43:09 - if you want it fine if you don't also
43:12 - that is completely fine so I'll
43:14 - duplicate this one to again and then
43:17 - this time around I'll put it down here
43:18 - and say song name goes
43:25 - here
43:26 - spand it to fill and this one you know
43:30 - you have to make it white so go to the
43:32 - sty sheet and then from the color we
43:34 - delete this one go to add color color
43:38 - choose this white and then okay so apply
43:42 - and then that is it and then we repeat
43:45 - it for
43:47 - the song part also but before then let
43:50 - me change the name of this one to
43:53 - current uncore song score
43:57 - name and so after that I can select the
44:00 - two of them by holding control command
44:02 - on Mark and then I can paste them down
44:05 - here and this one will be
44:11 - path and then finally this one will be
44:15 - song path goes
44:20 - here okay that is great I think we have
44:23 - to increase the size of our frame a bit
44:26 - so s path goes
44:28 - here and this one will be
44:32 - current andore
44:34 - songor
44:37 - path then we are left with the two
44:39 - buttons the add to favorite and then add
44:42 - to playlist so let's bring up a push
44:48 - button put it here and then
44:51 - automatically it inherits from the
44:54 - parent but you will change things very
44:55 - soon soon so let's just go ahead and
44:59 - then do the styling before we even put
45:01 - the icon there so change style sheet and
45:03 - then for this one the background color
45:06 - will be white so let's pick
45:11 - it and then the foreground color which
45:14 - is the
45:17 - color let's try this orange is not
45:20 - actually this orange but we modify this
45:22 - one we still need a 255 and this one
45:25 - instead of 170 let's make it 140 and
45:29 - then instead of Z let's make this 164
45:31 - that's the color I used so when you
45:34 - click on apply you see that the the
45:37 - testt shows there nicely and that is
45:39 - great we don't need to apply the Border
45:41 - radius because it's inheriting from the
45:42 - parent so for the font you can come up
45:45 - here and then bring it up a bit maybe 12
45:49 - is okay and then it can be pulled it
45:52 - happens to be that we can also add an
45:54 - icon plus the text to a btom so come
45:57 - here choose resource and then this one
46:00 - is the add to favorite so we will do it
46:04 - that way but the test also we have to
46:06 - change it we can also change it here
46:08 - equally so add
46:13 - to
46:15 - favorite
46:19 - great let me reduce the size a bit but I
46:23 - can make this one to
46:27 - 24 by 24 just to make it large okay and
46:32 - this one we have to now give it its
46:34 - proper
46:37 - name which
46:39 - is add to
46:43 - faor
46:45 - BTN great and then we can just copy this
46:48 - one and paste it inside here and then
46:52 - change this now the for the favorite we
46:55 - you only have to flip the colors so what
46:59 - is now the background color will be the
47:01 - foreground color so you can just cut
47:04 - this
47:05 - one and then paste it in here and then
47:09 - this place will be
47:11 - 255 255
47:18 - 255 so apply and then that is it for but
47:22 - let's also uh this will not be out to f
47:25 - BTN to this will be add to playlist BTN
47:30 - so add
47:32 - to playlist BTN and then we can come
47:36 - down here and change the
47:39 - icon
47:42 - to the name of the it's a music list
47:46 - yeah that one and so we have it that one
47:48 - also in case you think they are too
47:51 - close to each other you can actually
47:52 - give space manually here and that is
47:56 - also
47:57 - acceptable so let me give a space
48:00 - anually so now we are done with this
48:03 - side what did I just
48:12 - do okay it looks like I have done
48:16 - something I was not supposed to
48:20 - do okay
48:22 - okay it's good to know that's a great
48:25 - scen so let me save the work here I
48:27 - think it's a caution for me to save the
48:29 - work and then now the volume dial that
48:32 - one is called a dial so let me bring it
48:34 - up like this and then put it here but I
48:39 - want us to move this Frame up a
48:41 - bit
48:44 - great so the volume
48:46 - down let's just enlarge it and then put
48:51 - it here
48:53 - also when we come to the property of
48:56 - this D you can find that you have uh
48:59 - okay let's let's let's put the name
49:01 - there before volume
49:08 - D here we can set the minimum to
49:13 - one and then the maximum to 100 or the
49:17 - minimum should actually be zero because
49:19 - you can somebody can choose to put it as
49:21 - zero the single step is when I turn it
49:24 - what should be the step and that is one
49:27 - the current value 20 you see that the
49:31 - handle mooved to that particular
49:32 - position and then we
49:36 - can set the notches visible when you set
49:40 - notches visible we see that notches that
49:43 - that come out of it I think I like it
49:45 - that way if you don't like it you can
49:47 - choose to leave it and that is
49:49 - completely fine so one after this one
49:52 - what we need is another
49:54 - label
49:57 - on top of our volume
50:00 - dial which we will call volume label and
50:03 - then we we man set the value to 20
50:06 - because that's what it should
50:11 - be
50:13 - volume
50:16 - label and then let's increase the font
50:19 - let's bring it the sze
50:21 - up okay I think it's okay for me as it
50:25 - is
50:30 - I want to center it so I can come here
50:32 - down here and say the for the alignment
50:35 - the
50:35 - horizontal align H Center the vertical
50:39 - align V Center so that it will be at the
50:40 - center just like it is now and I think I
50:43 - like it that way I may want to make this
50:46 - one too bold also where is it where is
50:48 - it
50:49 - font and then
50:51 - bold okay looks great to
50:54 - me and what we are left with now I think
50:58 - we
50:58 - can finish the bottom part then now we
51:02 - tackle the the stack widget
51:05 - so let me open up the main
51:13 - again for this side we will create a one
51:19 - frame at the bottom and then inside it
51:23 - there will be another frame for the
51:24 - playback controls and then there will be
51:28 - this object also or this other widget
51:31 - also so that we can eily distribute the
51:35 - space for
51:37 - them for this
51:40 - one this particular frame it has I think
51:43 - I gave it a fixed width for the geometry
51:46 - did I no I didn't was it for this
51:50 - one no but this one I think it it it had
51:54 - okay for the height it did have okay for
51:56 - the height so let us work on these ones
51:59 - I think I can minimize itad of closing
52:01 - it every time
52:03 - okay so we need one frame at the bottom
52:06 - there usually it's hard to find here
52:08 - that's why okay but frame is just down
52:11 - here let's try and set it
52:15 - wide and open it up
52:24 - also
52:33 - forgive me if I'm not very fast with
52:35 - this UI building Parts because they
52:38 - usually take some time and then I need
52:41 - another frame inside
52:44 - it make sure it falls inside you can
52:47 - confirm from here that frame three is
52:49 - inside frame
52:54 - to
52:55 - and it is inside these ones that I we
52:58 - will add our push buttons for the
53:00 - playback control so push button make
53:03 - sure it's inside the inner
53:05 - frame and here you can delete the text
53:09 - select it and delete it
53:12 - sorry select the test and then delete it
53:15 - and then let's come here this one should
53:18 - be let's give it the name this one
53:20 - should be the
53:22 - playcore BTN
53:26 - come here
53:29 - icon choose resource and then
53:33 - images play play play where are
53:41 - you that is rather it's rather oh
53:45 - forgive me the the names are interchange
53:48 - this is rather supposed to be the pause
53:50 - but I made that one the play so you
53:53 - select that one and then you know that
53:56 - we have to make our background invisible
53:59 - so let's change Styles
54:02 - sheet and then choose any color that we
54:05 - want not sorry background color any
54:08 - background color that we want I just
54:11 - that the alpha should be
54:14 - zero for this one it will not really be
54:17 - zero but okay okay uh let us apply the
54:21 - sty sheet properly what I will do is
54:23 - that as I did for the minimize and close
54:26 - button so we have to get the Q push
54:29 - button
54:39 - class and here I can set the background
54:43 - color with an alpha of
54:51 - zero and then also set the Hoover so I
54:54 - can copy this this one and
54:57 - then say that when it is
55:03 - hoovered I want the same color but this
55:06 - time around Alpha should be
55:15 - 100 okay so apply think we let's copy it
55:19 - because we need it for the other ones
55:22 - also they they all they are all the same
55:24 - so when I H over you see that I have
55:26 - that nice style there for me but for
55:30 - this one also we will set a minimum size
55:33 - constraint on it so we can come to the
55:35 - top here and set the minimum size to be
55:39 - 30 the maximum uh minimum height and
55:43 - weight will be 30 each so that it will
55:46 - uh just be a square like this I think
55:49 - that is great so what we can do is to
55:52 - copy paste it make sure that it's still
55:55 - inside the small frame the inner frame
55:59 - you can see that all of them are here
56:01 - this will not be play btn2 this will
56:05 - be po
56:08 - BTN and all that we need to do here is
56:12 - to come and change the resource so
56:15 - choose the one for the pause and then we
56:18 - can copy paste it
56:23 - again don't worry to arrange them we use
56:25 - uh layout the layout spacing to do that
56:28 - so don't worry the next one is the stop
56:31 - so all we have to do is to change the
56:33 - name here so stop underscore
56:38 - BTN and then what we have to do is to
56:40 - come down and then change the resource
56:44 - icon to this stop and then copy and
56:48 - paste it again for the next the previous
56:51 - and all of
56:53 - them
57:02 - so next no the previous counts first so
57:07 - previous
57:09 - BTN let's copy paste it then later we
57:12 - change for all of them they icons so
57:15 - this one will be
57:17 - nextore
57:19 - BTN and then after the next we have the
57:22 - loop one and
57:27 - so this one will be
57:31 - loop1
57:33 - BTN and then we need it one more
57:37 - time for
57:43 - the
57:45 - shuffle underscore
57:47 - songsore BTN great so now let's change
57:51 - the icon so when I click on it this is
57:53 - the previous
58:02 - because the background is white it
58:03 - becomes difficult okay this
58:05 - previous and then the next one is the
58:17 - nextest then we have Loop
58:23 - one
58:25 - which is Loop one the there's there are
58:27 - two Loops one Loop and then the other is
58:29 - just Loop one so select the loop one and
58:33 - then the random
58:35 - play which is play random but for the
58:39 - loop one and the random we have to set
58:42 - this checkable property to true because
58:43 - they'll be
58:46 - checked great and let us now bring in
58:51 - our slider so our music slider so that
58:54 - will be
58:56 - horizontal slider
59:02 - here that one is inside the main frame
59:06 - the not uh not this the one that not the
59:09 - sub frame so let's keep this one here
59:12 - and the name is music
59:15 - slider
59:17 - music underscore
59:20 - slider
59:22 - okay and then we need one more label
59:24 - here
59:26 - here which we call the time label
59:30 - so time underscore
59:34 - label and that one
59:37 - to we have to change the style sheet
59:40 - make the test
59:43 - white so select color pick white and
59:47 - then
59:50 - okay but we have to increase the font
59:53 - size
59:56 - is
59:58 - it okay make it bold maybe which the
60:03 - test will be 0
60:05 - 0 0
60:08 - 0 slash 0
60:15 - z0 okay so this is great now let's apply
60:20 - The Styling for the
60:23 - slider
60:27 - the class is kill
60:30 - slider the capital S so kill
60:36 - slider and then we want to get the
60:38 - groove so double colon and then you get
60:41 - the
60:43 - groove and then because it's a
60:45 - horizontal we just say
60:48 - horizontal if it was vertical would have
60:50 - said the
60:53 - vertical
60:56 - we want to set the
60:58 - border to one pixel
61:02 - solid and then solid solid and then the
61:07 - color will be the color code will be
61:10 - 999
61:14 - 999 sorry B that then we put a colum
61:17 - here yes just like
61:20 - CSS it is actually CSS and then so we'll
61:24 - be applying it as we do it so that you
61:27 - get to appreciate it now you see that
61:28 - the border the default border that was
61:30 - there is gone now it's this border that
61:32 - is here and so we can continue by saying
61:36 - that let the
61:38 - height be 15
61:42 - pixels and then let's apply and see okay
61:46 - and then we can also set the
61:50 - padding so I give some breathing space
61:52 - to the slider uh the handle that is
61:55 - moving inside let's set the P into three
62:01 - pixels apply it and see okay you may not
62:04 - really see it until you start working on
62:05 - the handle and then the
62:11 - background the background color so
62:18 - background let's pick this color for for
62:20 - now but this will not be background
62:22 - color it just be background Swit delete
62:24 - the color from
62:26 - here and then that is
62:30 - rgba we want to set
62:33 - the red to zero the green to 255 so and
62:40 - this one to
62:42 - 127 and the alpha should be 100 when we
62:47 - apply it you should see that that's uh
62:50 - green color light green color there if I
62:52 - should change this one to 200 and appli
62:56 - that to be deeper but I don't like it
62:58 - that way I like the 100
63:02 - okay and then we can set some margins so
63:05 - let's give that a
63:06 - margin of 2
63:10 - pixels and then zero
63:15 - so for the top and bottom and then left
63:17 - and right and then so let's set it that
63:19 - way and then we can now also say that
63:22 - the
63:23 - Border
63:25 - radius
63:28 - is let's make this one's border radius
63:31 - 11
63:33 - pixels and then apply it and see so you
63:36 - see that the Border radius got applied
63:38 - and so let's work now on the handle that
63:41 - will also be still kill
63:46 - slider double colon get the
63:49 - handle and as you have guessed this one
63:52 - will also be the
63:53 - horizontal
63:59 - this one the
64:01 - background will be
64:06 - RGB you want a yellow color some that
64:09 - yellow color yellow color so that would
64:11 - be 255 for the red 200 for the green and
64:15 - 50 for the
64:18 - blue so if I apply it it is showing here
64:23 - like a line I don't know whether you see
64:25 - it from your side but once you go ahead
64:27 - you actually appreciate it coming in and
64:30 - then I can also see that the border for
64:33 - this one should be one pixel
64:37 - solid and then the color is 5 C 5 C 5
64:45 - C let's apply it and see still it's
64:49 - there but you see it very soon when it
64:51 - comes in or you know what let's bring
64:54 - the the value currently to maybe 50 or
64:57 - something like that you can set that one
65:00 - so for the slider the value current
65:03 - value bring it to
65:05 - 50 so you see that the the thing is in
65:08 - the middle like a yellow line so that is
65:10 - what we are working on and then now
65:13 - after that we can see that the
65:16 - width should be 18
65:19 - pixels let's apply now you see that it
65:23 - has gained some some size and then we
65:27 - can of course give it a margin or let's
65:31 - do the Border radius first the Border
65:35 - radius that one should be 9 pixels for
65:39 - this one so let's apply
65:42 - it do we not do something right but
65:45 - radius apply okay so it's not really
65:48 - applying the Border radius let's give it
65:50 - some margin so that at least to have
65:52 - some breathing space for that to work so
65:55 - margin and then this one will be -2
65:59 - pixels and then
66:03 - zero let's apply this time around and
66:06 - now we see that it's now circular one so
66:09 - that is how we also work on the
66:12 - slider for the our custom slider let me
66:16 - put it that way so what you want to do
66:19 - is to select the frame in which these
66:21 - playback controls are and then come and
66:23 - click on layout
66:26 - horizontally that one the frame will
66:28 - space them out automatically for us and
66:31 - then select the frame if it becomes
66:33 - difficult to select it here you can
66:34 - equally select it here right click on it
66:37 - and then change sty sheet we supposed to
66:38 - give a border radius of 10 pixels and we
66:40 - forgot because now if we hover over then
66:43 - that the backgrounds are square and
66:46 - that's not what we
66:49 - want so we can come here and say
66:53 - border
66:56 - radius of 10
66:59 - pixels then okay that one all the
67:02 - children will inherit now is that the
67:04 - Border radius has been applied great one
67:08 - very important thing we forgot is that
67:10 - the ker for each of these ones should be
67:12 - a pointer so when you select each of
67:14 - them where in the property data for the
67:17 - arrow change the arrow to pointer we'll
67:20 - be doing it for all of
67:22 - them
67:53 - oh okay so now let's select the bigger
67:56 - frame like this and lay that one two out
67:59 - horizontally you see that it has laid
68:01 - them out so let's just stretch it out
68:02 - and
68:03 - then let it fill the screen and then yes
68:06 - we have
68:09 - our slider and those one so we can
68:12 - resize it just to fill the space down
68:15 - there so we can let's just select our
68:16 - slider and bring
68:18 - the uh this one we can also set this one
68:21 - scure to pointing hand that's will not
68:23 - to be bad and for the value let's bring
68:27 - it back to zero or even
68:30 - one let's try Z and see not
68:34 - 10 zero okay for this dial Also let's
68:38 - set the
68:40 - hand this one we want to set it to open
68:43 - hand you can choose either the open or
68:45 - the closed hand if you go to
68:47 - preview and then let me select my Fusion
68:50 - style so that this hand is the Open Hand
68:55 - and you can immediately see that
68:57 - something is wrong
68:58 - here this border the frames that we are
69:02 - using their their borders are showing so
69:05 - let's come back select the title frame
69:07 - first come to this place where you see
69:09 - the Q frame and for the frame shap
69:12 - select new frame and then this one you
69:15 - can leave it this one you can leave this
69:16 - way and for this one to select the
69:19 - bigger frame the frame shape no frame
69:22 - but it looks like we have to increase
69:25 - the size a bit
69:34 - okay okay so now let's preview it again
69:37 - the shortcut on Windows is control R and
69:40 - Mark I think should be command R so now
69:42 - you see that the frames are gone and
69:45 - then everything is also visible now but
69:48 - I don't want this kind of K for the dial
69:51 - so I will come here and in of the open
69:54 - hand I will choose the closed hand
69:58 - rather I think that fits the purpose
70:01 - better than the open hand so yes that is
70:04 - the
70:06 - great so now let's work on the stack
70:08 - widget for the stack
70:13 - widgets I just search for
70:16 - stack stack
70:19 - widget and then put it in
70:22 - here
70:26 - three sizes to
70:28 - fill and let's
70:31 - just change the Styles
70:39 - sheet for the first one let's just add a
70:42 - background
70:43 - color I think we can copy
70:46 - from the one here but I think the alpha
70:49 - was it 100 or 150 let's try 100 and see
70:55 - apply this appears to be too much let's
70:58 - make it 50 and
71:00 - see okay I think the 50 is is okay the
71:04 - the icon the image at the background is
71:06 - also showing as well and then let's also
71:09 - apply the
71:11 - Border radius which all the children
71:13 - will inherit
71:16 - from to be 10 pixels and then
71:20 - okay so now we have this one to in the
71:23 - like like this still have more space
71:25 - down here no we need another space down
71:28 - here for the button so let's leave some
71:30 - some breathing space and then in here I
71:36 - will I'll bring a
71:44 - label for the song
71:49 - list right click on it you know that
71:51 - will hear it from the parents so I can
71:53 - now go to background color set the alpha
71:56 - to zero so that the text will not be
71:59 - showing that way I forgot to change the
72:01 - color bring the Star sheet back choose
72:04 - the
72:05 - color make it
72:08 - white okay okay and then we can come
72:12 - here change the font size 15 is okay
72:17 - bold and then we can now
72:20 - see song list
72:25 - okay and there are some three icons
72:28 - here sorry button here so we just come
72:30 - and say button or push button rather
72:33 - push
72:34 - button select this
72:40 - one the minimum size should
72:44 - be
72:47 - 30
72:50 - 30 not not 3 30 30
73:01 - okay okay this one was the add songs BTN
73:06 - so let's just add the name so add
73:11 - songsore
73:13 - BTN let's come and change the
73:17 - icon choose
73:19 - resource and then it is this one
73:24 - okay so let's change the icon size this
73:25 - one let's make it 32 by 32 and then it
73:30 - comes out large okay but the background
73:33 - for that one in the demo was white if I
73:36 - show you to you that is white like this
73:38 - so let me just change the Styles
73:44 - sheet and then add color background
73:46 - color is
73:48 - white think white is already selected
73:52 - apply but this one to the Border radius
73:55 - is not really 10 pixel so you can say
73:57 - border
73:59 - radius let's take it to six pixels and
74:06 - see I think it's it's perfect for for
74:10 - what we needed to do so we can duplicate
74:13 - this one two
74:15 - times control comma or command C and
74:18 - then paste it in here and the other one
74:23 - name
74:29 - is delete uncore selected uncore
74:38 - BTN and then we can duplicate it one
74:42 - more time and say that one is so delete
74:46 - all songs
74:50 - BTN delete uncore all
74:54 - _ songs BTN great and now let's change
74:59 - the icons so for this
75:04 - one resource and it is clear.png
75:09 - and for this
75:11 - one
75:13 - let's this is the remove okay so the top
75:17 - part is also done cancel the top part is
75:20 - also done let's me save the work up to
75:22 - this point
75:23 - and then we can work on the the list
75:27 - widgets inside so for the list widgets
75:29 - let's come here and search for list
75:33 - don't pick the list view pick the list
75:35 - widgets and let's just put it in here
75:39 - and that is so great because it already
75:41 - inherit from the parents and that's some
75:43 - of the things that we want you to
75:45 - do for this one we can add a few things
75:49 - here so that we check it to can say song
75:52 - One
75:56 - song two we delete them
76:00 - afterwards and then this is song
76:05 - three okay so that we when we apply The
76:08 - Styling we will see it you can actually
76:09 - see that you don't actually see anything
76:12 - but let's bring up the Fone size
76:20 - first 15 is okay
76:24 - then the style sheet for this one the
76:30 - color will be an RGB
76:33 - of 86
76:36 - red
76:38 - 227 green and then
76:41 - 194
76:44 - blue so when we apply it you see that
76:48 - that the song name has changed that is
76:50 - the name there and then the
76:53 - background color that we can get it from
77:01 - here it is black but you want to set the
77:04 - alpha to 100 you know the parent is 50
77:07 - so this one will be 100 then it become
77:09 - uh oh not color this will supposed to be
77:12 - background color the parent is 50 so
77:16 - this one is 100 it brings it it makes it
77:19 - stand out a bit so that it is easily
77:22 - recognized to apply then you see that
77:24 - that one stands out a bit and make it
77:26 - easily recognize and then we can also
77:29 - say selection background color so that
77:32 - one is here selection background color
77:34 - let's pick any color for
77:37 - now and then let's change it to the
77:39 - proper one so it is 255 for this
77:43 - 170
77:44 - 140 and then
77:48 - 64 remember the orange color we used I
77:50 - think that is the same one uh we will
77:52 - not see see it until we do a selection
77:54 - which we cannot do when the Star sheet
77:56 - is open and then we can also do
77:59 - selection
78:07 - color and that one is white so
78:12 - RGB
78:13 - 255
78:16 - 255 and then
78:19 - 255 okay let's give a pattering
78:24 - of 10 pixels for each of the items in
78:27 - there so apply okay and I think the song
78:31 - name should be
78:33 - bold the the font should be
78:37 - bold
78:39 - okay you realize that as I clicked I
78:41 - didn't see the selection color and that
78:44 - is because let's check it in preview I
78:46 - think it's because you are not in
78:47 - preview let's check it in preview and
78:51 - see okay selection background color
78:54 - didn't work so let's let's see what the
78:57 - issue might
79:01 - be change style
79:04 - sheets did we spell something
79:08 - wrong our sty sheet is valid but this
79:13 - this one I think it it will only work
79:15 - when we are in
79:17 - the python so let's for the finished one
79:20 - let's just add just one song and see
79:24 - and then now preview this
79:27 - main see that when we select it still
79:29 - doesn't show but if you check the Styles
79:31 - sheet for the finished one also it has
79:34 - the selection background color and all
79:36 - so this one unfortunately Works only
79:38 - when we are in Python that is why it is
79:41 - not showing so yes we did it but select
79:45 - the list widget again and then come down
79:48 - the scroll
79:50 - area q abstract scroll area just set all
79:53 - of them to
79:54 - off so that there will be no scroll bar
79:57 - showing it doesn't make it nice and then
80:00 - now for the last thing on this page oh
80:03 - why did I close out this
80:06 - widget widget
80:09 - box for the last one on this we have to
80:11 - now also bring a frame
80:14 - again down here down the song list
80:17 - withget and then that is where our three
80:20 - buttons will
80:21 - be
80:28 - so we can now go ahead and bring in our
80:33 - BTN which is a push
80:36 - button right
80:38 - here inside that frame and this one we
80:42 - call it
80:43 - song list and the name the object name
80:48 - should
80:50 - be song uncore
80:53 - listor
80:57 - BTN for the sty sheet I will go ahead
81:00 - and copy the color from
81:02 - here let me
81:06 - see okay so this is the background color
81:09 - and then the Border radius I think I'll
81:11 - copy
81:18 - everything and then just paste it in
81:27 - okay it's not really showing the Border
81:32 - radius remember the frame this one to
81:35 - let's let's set this one to no frame and
81:38 - then maybe the Border radius should
81:40 - apply to the the parents rather so
81:42 - border
81:46 - radius of 10
81:49 - pixels
81:51 - okay
81:53 - then the next button is the
81:59 - playlist
82:04 - playlist which is also called playlist
82:17 - BTN let's go ahead and change the color
82:20 - for this one the color the background
82:22 - color is green color so delete the
82:26 - existing background
82:28 - color and then let's pick this
82:32 - screen or maybe this
82:35 - one
82:38 - okay but the the font size let's bring
82:42 - them
82:47 - up 12 is okay for me and let me make it
82:50 - bold this one too should be bold
82:53 - and then
82:55 - 12 and then finally you can copy paste
82:59 - this for the
83:08 - favorites okay for this one to should be
83:11 - favorite
83:21 - BTN and then let's just change the
83:24 - background
83:28 - color I'll pick a screen color because
83:30 - the same as this orange here and then
83:34 - okay okay so now I select the frame in
83:37 - which all of them are that's the frame
83:39 - four here you can see they are all
83:40 - indented inside and then I'll give it a
83:49 - layout it looks like this our buttons
83:52 - then still don't want to show the
83:54 - rounded
83:56 - Corners
83:59 - okay let's set minimum
84:02 - height to 32 and let me see not not for
84:08 - the not for the frame for just one of
84:11 - the buttons set the minimum height to 32
84:15 - and then you see that it shows so for
84:17 - the playlist also set the minimum height
84:20 - to be 32 and then the favorite also set
84:24 - the minimum height to be 32 great so now
84:29 - this first page of our application is
84:31 - done this was only needed for testing
84:33 - let me edit items and remove all of
84:38 - them okay so the first page of our
84:40 - application is
84:44 - done our volume D is not
84:51 - here
84:54 - where would it
84:57 - be oh okay has gone to the back so let
85:00 - me just right click and then bring to
85:02 - front Okay and then right click on the
85:05 - label bring that one to to front Okay
85:09 - so that one is it so our first page for
85:13 - this one is done you just have to click
85:15 - there is if you look closely on the list
85:17 - widget on the stack widget at the top
85:20 - right there is some arrows that you can
85:21 - use to na so we say go to next page and
85:24 - I go to the next page it's completely
85:26 - blank so that is where we will do our
85:35 - playlist things are very similar here so
85:37 - I'll just copy this I just need one of
85:40 - the button because it's just load
85:41 - selected that we do as well as the list
85:43 - with it and
85:48 - then
85:51 - no
85:53 - hold control copy
85:55 - them and then on the second page let's
85:59 - just paste
86:05 - it okay and this place will
86:08 - be
86:12 - playlist and this
86:15 - place this particular one it doesn't
86:18 - even have an icon so let's remove the
86:20 - icon from there can click this uh button
86:23 - at the right side and then it will take
86:25 - it off so we can here
86:28 - see
86:32 - loaded this one you don't really have to
86:34 - give it a lot of the the color
86:36 - background color is some green color so
86:41 - let's pick a screen color for the
86:47 - green this one should do okay and then
86:53 - the font size should come up a
86:58 - bit B make it nice
87:03 - also okay and then uh we want to
87:07 - increase the Border radius to 10
87:13 - pixels okay or even
87:17 - higher let's try 15 and
87:21 - see
87:24 - okay that looks good to me but there's a
87:26 - very big uh something that we were
87:28 - supposed to that we didn't do on this
87:29 - song Let come here and then you know we
87:33 - have to call it
87:35 - loaded
87:37 - songs list widgets like
87:41 - this and then we go
87:43 - to page two here you can click on this
87:46 - pages to also navigate and then the list
87:49 - widget here now we call it playlist list
88:01 - wigets okay so that is also completely
88:06 - fine and so we are left to the next and
88:09 - the last page which is the favorite
88:14 - page we will also employ something from
88:18 - here this song list you actually need
88:22 - and for the favorite we need this two so
88:25 - control be clicking on all of them
88:28 - control command C and then navigate
88:33 - navigate okay we have to add another
88:35 - page to it before
88:37 - so for the stack wet you can just right
88:40 - click insert
88:43 - page uh okay let's go to the playlist
88:46 - because we can insert after the current
88:48 - page so insert page
88:50 - here after current page and that become
88:54 - page three down here you don't you don't
88:57 - actually need to name the pages we use
88:59 - the index to uh move around so that one
89:03 - should be fine and I paste what we
89:05 - copied in
89:11 - here okay so this
89:16 - one should be
89:20 - favorite
89:23 - and then this ones we have to change
89:25 - their
89:31 - names this will be
89:34 - delete
89:37 - selected
89:38 - favorite _
89:42 - BTN and then this one
89:46 - will which the next one
89:48 - here should
89:50 - be delete all favorite ptn so I can just
89:55 - change the songs
89:57 - [Music]
89:58 - to
90:03 - favorites and then this one will be
90:05 - favorite list widget so favorit list
90:10 - widget the
90:14 - T
90:16 - favorit list wigets just like that so
90:21 - that is the app interface design for
90:26 - this stack widget whatever page you
90:28 - leave it on before you save it is the
90:31 - default page that will render when the
90:33 - application first opens so you want
90:37 - to you may have to bring this thing up a
90:40 - bit okay we want to leave it on the
90:43 - first page just like this one is so that
90:46 - is it we can preview our app and for the
90:49 - preview we can use this button to
90:51 - navigate but inside python we will have
90:54 - to write our own functions to do the
90:56 - navigation and it wouldn't be a problem
90:58 - at
90:59 - all
91:02 - okay so that is how we I built the UI or
91:05 - that's how you can build the UI and let
91:08 - us work on the actions the actions are
91:12 - what will come in the popup menu or the
91:15 - context menu uh but for now let's okay
91:18 - let's work on the signals first for the
91:19 - signal let me expand this want to add a
91:23 - signal the sender will be
91:29 - our the center will be our Clos BTN
91:36 - here you see now when we let's preview
91:40 - when you click this close nothing will
91:42 - happen but okay this ones even in the
91:44 - property editor the curer should not be
91:46 - Arrow should be
91:49 - pointer the same as this one
91:53 - one so the signal that we want from it
91:57 - is that when it is
92:04 - clicked the receiver should be the music
92:07 - app itself that is the the UI itself and
92:11 - the slot is
92:13 - close so now let us preview it again and
92:17 - then click on this one so that it closes
92:19 - the application so we can set another
92:21 - one for the
92:28 - minimized so minimize
92:31 - BTN saw it here
92:35 - yes when it is
92:43 - clicked the receiver again should be
92:45 - music
92:46 - up and then the slot should
92:50 - be
92:53 - show
92:54 - minimized like that so that one too
92:57 - would work the next one that we work on
92:59 - is for the volume
93:06 - down when the volume
93:11 - down we want
93:15 - the slider moved this
93:20 - one and you see currently if we preview
93:22 - it and then move the slider nothing will
93:25 - happen nothing will happen what kind of
93:28 - Icon have we given to this should
93:31 - be closed hand
93:34 - yep so we want the receiver to be the
93:37 - volume label the one on top of it that
93:39 - values that to be changing the volume
93:47 - label and then we have to
93:50 - set okay okay there's no set text so
93:53 - let's pick the set number and then the
93:55 - int okay so now when we preview this one
93:59 - and I turn it see that the value will
94:01 - also be turning together with it so now
94:05 - let me show you the actions and that
94:07 - will be it for the building of the
94:10 - UI for the
94:13 - actions we just click this one and then
94:15 - this one let's call it play is that you
94:19 - automatically give the name action play
94:21 - for the
94:22 - icon let's just click this place and
94:25 - then choose the particular icon
94:30 - here if you want to set a tool tape to
94:33 - you can say you can add it to
94:35 - play and then the next action will be
94:49 - pause on PA pause SL
94:54 - onpa capital
94:57 - P okay and then the icon for that one
95:00 - also let's choose the
95:02 - resource to this
95:05 - one if you can add shortcut to if you
95:08 - want to but I wouldn't do it if you want
95:10 - to add a shortcut okay I'll show you in
95:12 - the next one the next one is action
95:15 - next and then I can also say
95:20 - next no next
95:24 - next
95:27 - okay if you want to add a shortcut all
95:29 - you have to do is to click inside here
95:31 - and then press the particular shortcut
95:33 - but I I was I was trying to delete it so
95:37 - the back space also keep choose resource
95:39 - file this one and then where is our next
95:43 - next next this
95:46 - one okay and then the next one on the
95:49 - list is the action
96:09 - previous okay so I believe you get the
96:12 - idea of the actions I don't think I
96:15 - should extend the video any longer by
96:18 - creating all the actions because this is
96:20 - not the file that we'll be using as I
96:21 - said we will still be using the main do
96:24 - UI just that this session I was just
96:27 - focusing on showing you how to build the
96:29 - UI yourself so that is it for this
96:32 - session let's look at let's go into py
96:35 - charm and see how we can convert this
96:37 - one to code and then start working on
96:40 - our great
96:41 - application so let me close this
96:45 - one and even close this one also and
96:49 - then let's move to the The Next
96:52 - Step so I think I shouldn't close it we
96:55 - will need to make reference to this UI
96:57 - so sorry let me open it again and then
96:59 - let me open the main one so let's just
97:01 - minimize it we come back to it so let's
97:04 - convert this one to python code
97:05 - obviously this one is not what we be
97:08 - running so let's convert it to python
97:10 - code I'll go back to my terminal and
97:13 - what I have to do to convert the
97:15 - resource file to python code it will say
97:19 - pic5 and then I I bring a flag of DX The
97:24 - Hyphen X is the flag for the incoming Ur
97:26 - file so that is main. UI and then
97:30 - another flag hyph O for the python file
97:33 - that should be generated I will call it
97:35 - music. py you can choose any name but
97:38 - you have
97:40 - to keep that in mind in case I Call
97:43 - Music you you call that particular file
97:44 - name but if you choose music also just
97:46 - press enter looks like nothing has
97:48 - happened but if I list you see that now
97:51 - now there's a music. pii file here it
97:53 - wasn't here at first if you check your
97:55 - you see that it's it's a new file G has
97:58 - told us a new file when we open it now
98:01 - you see that it has generated the code
98:04 - for us for the
98:05 - application but if we run this thing
98:09 - now you see that we get an error it says
98:11 - no model named re. RC and that is
98:15 - because P5 is trying to import the
98:19 - resource file that we used and and it is
98:21 - not finding it even though it is here
98:23 - and that should tell us that that is not
98:24 - this resource file it is looking for
98:26 - it's looking for a python version of
98:27 - this resource file so what we have to
98:29 - come back to our terminal and do is to
98:31 - convert this resource file into uh
98:33 - python uh file and that is done by pi r
98:38 - cc5 and then this one the output flag
98:42 - comes first we give the name of the
98:44 - Python file that will be generated from
98:46 - the resource file and
98:48 - usually as you saw it to key to
98:52 - automatically name it and so I usually
98:55 - use this name for it so that anytime I
98:56 - make changes to my UI file and I have to
98:58 - run the pic5 for command again I don't
99:02 - have to come and change this name all
99:03 - the time in fact you noce from the top
99:06 - here that it tells you that if you make
99:07 - changes and run it again you lose all
99:10 - the changes so I don't want to put
99:12 - myself into that trouble usually you
99:15 - will be making changes to your Ur file
99:17 - and then be converting it again so I
99:19 - just use this name to be
99:23 - and then so I'll just paste the name
99:25 - there py and then I give a space and
99:28 - then give the name of the resource file
99:30 - that should be converted which you know
99:31 - from the top there is re do QRC and you
99:35 - press
99:36 - enter and you list you see that that one
99:39 - too has been created for us so let us
99:41 - come back to
99:43 - Python and now this red arrow should go
99:46 - away anytime soon when we run it again
99:49 - we shouldn't have the
99:52 - error okay so now it has come this is
99:55 - our file you see that the default title
99:58 - bar is there so that is what we have to
100:00 - get rid of when you click on this one
100:01 - you cannot move the app around but of
100:03 - course this one will close it for us
100:05 - okay so you see that I run from this
100:08 - file and it was successful but usually
100:09 - that's not how I do my my pt5 project
100:13 - because this UI file I make changing it
100:15 - anytime that I want and I don't want to
100:18 - be pasting my functions here so that
100:20 - I'll be losing it every time I'm copying
100:22 - and pasting it again it's a whole lot of
100:24 - stress so what I do is that I create a
100:26 - new
100:27 - file which I'll call
100:30 - main.py and that is the reason I didn't
100:32 - name this main UI
100:34 - file
100:36 - main.py the name is main. UI you were
100:40 - thinking obviously that the python file
100:42 - should be also main. Pui but because I
100:45 - have one that I'll be calling main.py I
100:47 - decided
100:49 - to keep that name
100:52 - okay and in here what I do is that I
100:55 - create a class that calls the this
100:58 - music. py file see that there's a class
101:00 - that runs the application it's at the
101:02 - top here it's called UI music app so I
101:04 - create a class inside this main that
101:07 - calls this one and runs the application
101:08 - let's see how that one goes what we have
101:10 - to do is to import okay know
101:14 - from from P
101:17 - qt5 QT widget we want to import
101:20 - everything
101:22 - Q widget we want to import
101:25 - everything and then we create the class
101:27 - so let's say that the name of the class
101:29 - will be
101:31 - modern
101:34 - music
101:36 - player this will inherit from Q main
101:40 - window coming from the QT widget up
101:43 - there and then oh okay I didn't bring
101:46 - the import sorry so Import
101:49 - St and then we also have to import the
101:52 - class from the music. py so we can here
101:56 - say um
101:59 - from music you want to import UI music
102:04 - app as the name is here okay and so
102:08 - after this it also has to get this UI
102:11 - music
102:12 - app and then the default class stuff so
102:15 - we have to Define our in
102:19 - it okay
102:21 - but this one we will call the super also
102:24 - so super call should be
102:27 - here and inside this we will now also
102:31 - say that now we've created a class we
102:33 - have to Now call our window so self.
102:38 - window should be equal to Q main
102:43 - window QT we can create Windows just
102:46 - from widget but we want this one be a
102:48 - main window that is why we are doing
102:49 - that and then we can say s. setup
102:54 - UI and then weet it equal to
102:58 - self okay this s is redundant move
103:01 - redundant
103:03 - parenthesis and then what we can do is
103:05 - to say
103:07 - self do
103:09 - show to show the
103:11 - application if we run this main. Pui
103:14 - file this current file it will still not
103:16 - show our application you can see that
103:17 - process finished with exit Code Zero and
103:20 - that is because that's not how to run QT
103:22 - applications if you come to this music.
103:24 - py file all the way down you see that
103:26 - they they call
103:28 - this uh this so this stuff all has to be
103:32 - they have to come in place before the
103:33 - app will successfully run
103:37 - so I don't do it also in this file and
103:40 - that is because that's how I usually
103:41 - like to keep my things organized so that
103:43 - I don't really mess up with the code
103:44 - sometimes the code bases can be large
103:47 - and so if you mess up one it really
103:49 - takes time to
103:51 - get back on trct so I usually create
103:53 - another file which I call
103:55 - run which will now run the application I
103:59 - don't want to add it now and from there
104:02 - we can just see that from Main sorry
104:06 - from Main you want to import the modern
104:10 - music player that class that we created
104:13 - and then
104:14 - from P qt5 QT widget we want to import Q
104:23 - application course we need an
104:25 - application inst to run the application
104:27 - we also need a system Library so you
104:29 - want to
104:30 - import
104:33 - Sy I was wrong with my typing today
104:36 - import X Ys and then now we declare that
104:38 - the app instance is equal to kill
104:43 - application here we can pass in uh an
104:47 - empty list it it it this place takes in
104:50 - the
104:51 - the things that the application needs to
104:53 - run so all the dependencies that it
104:55 - needs and so we can't be safe in here to
104:57 - say six do agre so that the takes in all
105:01 - the argument that is needs to to run
105:03 - successfully and then we can say
105:08 - window should Beal to the ADV the modern
105:11 - music player the one that we created and
105:14 - then we can just say sis do
105:19 - exit and then you can say app do execute
105:23 - so exec where is
105:27 - it this one this is very similar to what
105:30 - we found in the music. py because you
105:32 - have to create an application instance
105:35 - and then run that particular application
105:37 - so that is what you are trying to do
105:39 - here just trying to so now if we run
105:42 - this
105:43 - run.py of course let me right click and
105:45 - then
105:47 - run you see that our application now
105:49 - comes okay so this is what you be using
105:52 - to run application
105:54 - but I like a style in QT called the
105:59 - fusion style that is how I used to I
106:01 - like all my applications in C so I
106:03 - usually add it and so I can now come
106:06 - here and say app do set style not set
106:10 - style sheet set style sheets another
106:12 - thing you want to set style to
106:16 - Fusion that is great so let's run it and
106:19 - see of course because this one has been
106:21 - fully customized we will not really see
106:22 - the changes but it does
106:24 - happen I like it that way so now all the
106:27 - rest will be coming inside here this run
106:29 - we may not even need it again it's
106:30 - already in my configuration here so let
106:32 - me close out from this window to for
106:34 - some time I just hope the size of the
106:37 - font is loud enough uh it's enough for
106:40 - you to
106:41 - see
106:43 - okay now the first thing is to get rate
106:47 - of this default title bar the default
106:50 - one there so after the setup uh UI
106:54 - before the show let's just say uh it's
106:58 - going to be a lot of lines of course so
106:59 - I'll do my best to comment it out so
107:04 - remove default title title bar
107:11 - okay and this is how we go about it self
107:16 - do set
107:19 - attribute
107:22 - attribute want to set the attribute to
107:24 - QT Dot and we have to import that one at
107:29 - the top here also so we can just say
107:31 - from pqt 5. QT so
107:34 - from PI qt5 do QT Coe sorry we want to
107:40 - import
107:42 - QT like that and then so we say QT do
107:49 - wa for translucent background like
107:54 - this and then the next one that we have
107:56 - to
108:00 - do is so yourself do set window Flags
108:07 - set
108:09 - window yes so set
108:12 - window Flags please make sure that you
108:15 - check the capitalization also so accept
108:17 - window flags and then we can say Q T
108:22 - dot frameless window hint this one
108:25 - should do for us and so if you run it
108:29 - now our Apple will come but
108:33 - the the title bar will not be there so
108:35 - you see that now I cannot move it around
108:37 - even though I can close it because we
108:39 - set that option there other than that we
108:40 - didn't have any way to close it maybe we
108:43 - would have used yeser the stop here to
108:46 - stop it or if you using the terminal
108:48 - control C to break out of it so what we
108:50 - have to do now is to write the function
108:53 - to be able to move our app around using
108:55 - our own title bar we will need some few
108:58 - things so let's just say
109:02 - initial
109:03 - position of the
109:07 - window okay and let's create a let's get
109:10 - that one in a variable so
109:12 - self do
109:15 - initial position sorry
109:18 - position let's set it equal to
109:21 - self dot position this
109:24 - one I think it is yelling at me that I
109:27 - didn't spell something right
109:30 - okay and then we will have to now write
109:33 - some functions to take care of the
109:36 - position that we want to set all of it
109:39 - will happen before the show so let's now
109:42 - Define please check the indentation of
109:45 - this one is inside the init another
109:46 - function the function is inside the init
109:48 - so self
109:52 - it's inside init you call it move
109:57 - up sorry move app okay but this one we
110:02 - take in events not
110:05 - self and then we can see that if event
110:09 - dot buttons that means if uh sorry
110:15 - buttons the button that has been clicked
110:17 - on the mouse if it is equal to QT do
110:21 - left button you want to be able to use
110:23 - the left button as I click and drag to
110:25 - move it around if you want to use the
110:27 - right button which I don't think you
110:28 - want to do you can do here right button
110:31 - okay so now we can to say s.
110:34 - move we want to move the application and
110:37 - you want to move it by sell do position
110:40 - no the position that we set up there and
110:46 - then we can say plus sorry plus
110:51 - event dot
110:54 - Global
110:58 - position minus sorry sorry sorry
111:02 - sorry minus sell. initial
111:06 - position okay so that is not all we have
111:11 - to add some other stuff so now we can
111:13 - say self. initial position should be
111:16 - equal to event sorry event do
111:21 - Global
111:28 - position and then event do accept to
111:33 - accept the particular
111:37 - event okay hopefully this should do the
111:41 - trick but we have to connect it
111:45 - to Something in QT you have something
111:48 - called signals and Slot like I show you
111:49 - how we change the label on the volume
111:52 - down when it is turned round and all
111:53 - that so this you can think of it like uh
111:56 - some something to be performed when an
111:58 - action is triggered but we have not yet
111:59 - defined that particular action that will
112:01 - trigger this so we have to now say self.
112:03 - title frame which is the name of this
112:07 - Frame
112:08 - here that moves our
112:11 - app
112:14 - dot mouse move event so when the mouse
112:18 - uh it has a mouse move event sorry we
112:21 - want to set that one equal to the move
112:24 - app that we have up here but we will not
112:26 - be calling it we just use it like this
112:29 - so let's just see how it
112:31 - goes you see that it doesn't actually
112:34 - work it doesn't actually work and that
112:36 - is because we have to create one more
112:40 - function that is how done in QT I there
112:43 - some research on it and found out how to
112:45 - do it this way so that one will be after
112:49 - the show
112:51 - sorry sorry sorry this one should come
112:52 - the show should come before I think that
112:55 - should be one of the reason because this
112:58 - show should be here this connections
113:00 - they happen after all so the show should
113:05 - come
113:07 - okay
113:10 - okay so now let's run it and
113:15 - see I'm still not able to move it around
113:18 - and that is I think it's because there
113:20 - one of the there's one more function
113:21 - that we have not created yet so outside
113:25 - the
113:26 - init but is still inside the class we
113:29 - want to now create a function that will
113:32 - or a method that will handle the mouse
113:35 - position
113:37 - so function to
113:40 - handle
113:43 - Mouse
113:45 - position and then we can say
113:48 - DF Mouse press event this one is coming
113:52 - in from QT itself you don't have to use
113:53 - your own naming convention to name this
113:55 - function just as it is make sure you
113:58 - type it but I can get rid of all of
114:00 - these things here and then just put in
114:06 - events once again I repeat this method
114:09 - is not one of my own it's coming from QT
114:11 - you have to type the name exactly before
114:13 - it works so you can actually see that
114:14 - sell do initial
114:18 - position
114:20 - initial position should be equal to
114:23 - event.
114:25 - Global position just like this and
114:29 - hopefully this should work for
114:36 - us so now when I click I can move it
114:39 - around just like the title bar has been
114:41 - doing I can minimize it I can bring it
114:44 - back I can close it and it all works
114:48 - so right okay took some time for you to
114:50 - go off from pyam but we know that it's
114:53 - still
114:54 - working okay so now let's move on
114:57 - to the obvious things to start importing
115:00 - files using this button here and then
115:03 - playing
115:04 - them so we can call it ad
115:14 - songs Okay so the method's name will be
115:18 - add s
115:22 - sorry and then it takes itself because
115:25 - it's a method of the class and then we
115:27 - can now say
115:31 - files it Returns the returns are two let
115:34 - me just show you why I want to really
115:36 - want you to really understand why I'm
115:37 - doing the things I do so files equal to
115:40 - K file dialogue this is coming from the
115:42 - QT reg that we imported at the top dot
115:45 - get open file
115:48 - name get open file name uh
115:53 - get open file names so I was looking for
115:56 - this
115:57 - one and then in here we can pass a
115:59 - couple of things the first one should be
116:01 - self and then the second one is the
116:03 - caption so the caption is the title of
116:05 - the window that will come up there so we
116:07 - can now say as a string maybe add songs
116:12 - to the
116:16 - app okay after the caption we can also
116:20 - passing the
116:22 - directory and that is the directory that
116:24 - it should open to by
116:27 - default if you put in any directory here
116:30 - hardcoded directory here like your
116:33 - desktop or your music or your documents
116:36 - that is where it will open to at all
116:38 - times but there's another cool trick
116:40 - that I want to show you if you put in a
116:43 - colum and then two backs slashes like
116:45 - this what it will do is that it will
116:47 - always remember the previous place that
116:50 - it's it's open to so let's say for the
116:52 - first time you loaded the songs from
116:54 - your music folder the second time you
116:56 - open the app and try to load uh the
116:58 - second time you try to load songs it
117:00 - will go to your music folder because
117:01 - that's the recent one it have visited if
117:04 - you change it again now and then you
117:05 - open it now from downloads when you open
117:07 - it again it will go and fetch it from
117:09 - the downloads folder and that is what I
117:11 - am talking about
117:14 - so and the next one is the
117:17 - filter the filter is to let it uh okay
117:21 - let me leave the filter here for now but
117:24 - if if what the filter does is it filters
117:27 - the particular files that should show in
117:29 - the window the the open window so if you
117:33 - just say here that um mp3 it will only
117:36 - show MP3 files for you to select so it's
117:39 - a way to restrict the user from bringing
117:41 - in files that are not supported into the
117:43 - application but for that one I have it
117:46 - here let me copy it from the second
117:48 - screen and then paste it
117:52 - in okay so these are the supported files
117:55 - that application will take from MP3 to
117:57 - MPEG and all those ones I also research
118:00 - about this one and then saw that the QT
118:02 - supports all of these file types if
118:05 - there are more I don't know but these
118:06 - are the ones I found and now we can say
118:09 - that if files so if files that means the
118:12 - user can
118:13 - actually open the window without
118:16 - selecting files so now if files that the
118:19 - person select and I think I named it
118:21 - here fly so files okay so if files what
118:25 - we want to do is that let me now just
118:27 - print files I want to show you something
118:30 - and before this one will work we have to
118:32 - connect this method to one of our
118:35 - actions or our button so at the top here
118:38 - before the show I will just come down a
118:39 - bit and then now give a comment here
118:44 - connections okay and inside here too I
118:46 - will give the another one called
118:51 - default page uh I am doing this and you
118:55 - understand very soon because I want to
118:56 - group things uh where they are supposed
118:59 - to be and I can say self do ad songs BTN
119:04 - that is the name of this one if I click
119:06 - on it you see that it's addon BN at the
119:08 - top here that is what is used to add
119:10 - song so do
119:13 - click not click do click dot connect
119:16 - when it is clicked we want to connect it
119:18 - to sell do add
119:21 - songs add songs okay but we don't call
119:26 - it in here just make it like this
119:29 - okay now when we run
119:34 - it when I click on it you see that it
119:39 - remember the place of the previous one
119:42 - and then it took me there so if I should
119:46 - let's say just create a test folder here
119:50 - let me call it test because I already
119:52 - have a new folder there and then for
119:54 - this time around let me just do some
119:56 - cancel it if I now open it again because
120:00 - obviously I didn't select any song Let
120:02 - me uh see if I can copy from this window
120:05 - okay copy it's a test and then you paste
120:08 - it and then let me select this
120:12 - open and then try the operation again it
120:15 - took me to this place but I need this
120:17 - time if I come here and select it
120:19 - and then open I come again it took me to
120:23 - this place remember the place where I
120:24 - was previously and that is what I was
120:26 - trying to show you and we should have
120:28 - something in our terminal also that I
120:29 - want to show you this is the result that
120:32 - came the first
120:35 - one see that that one was empty so
120:37 - that's why we saying that it fils and
120:39 - then the second one that I selected only
120:41 - one song you see that as part of the
120:44 - return it gives us first uh tiple of
120:46 - this uh a list sorry of of the files
120:50 - themselves and then it also comes with
120:52 - another one for the supported files so
120:55 - we only want this first part of the list
120:57 - of files so that is if we want it that
121:01 - way we can easily C for it this place
121:04 - and just say files comma and then
121:06 - usually they place an underscore there
121:09 - sorry because the second part so this
121:11 - part will be for the first part which is
121:12 - the list of files and then this part
121:14 - will be for the part that we don't need
121:16 - so if you run it again
121:18 - now
121:19 - and then add songs let me select all my
121:23 - songs here and then boom you see on the
121:26 - thumbil that let me close this you see
121:29 - that there is only the list of songs
121:30 - here that we have and so the next
121:33 - obvious thing that we want to do is to
121:34 - add these names to our song list widget
121:38 - that is on the first page so that is
121:40 - what you want to do so we will not be
121:42 - printing files like I've done here and
121:44 - we can just
121:45 - see self. loaded song list widget that
121:49 - is the name of this widget here the
121:52 - first one here so if I click on it see I
121:55 - loaded song list
121:57 - widget do add items or okay if files
122:03 - then we let's now say for file in files
122:06 - because of something that we do later
122:08 - for
122:10 - file in sorry in files then we can just
122:15 - say
122:16 - sell do loaded songlist widget do add
122:20 - item want to add item want to add the
122:23 - particular file so let's see how that
122:25 - one to
122:30 - goes our favorite
122:33 - playlist okay so is that we have it
122:35 - added here obviously not in the way that
122:37 - we wanted it to be because all you the
122:41 - music players or media players that we
122:43 - know of doesn't show you the full PA of
122:46 - the song it only shows you the the song
122:49 - elv or the song names as they appear in
122:51 - the folder and that is what you about to
122:52 - do
122:54 - next this thing is too large and we can
122:58 - easily do that with the OS module so let
123:01 - me just instead of just the raw file I
123:03 - can just say os. path do base name this
123:09 - will give me just the name of the
123:10 - particular file and so if I run it
123:17 - now
123:19 - you see that now I only have the file
123:21 - names and they are displayed here nicely
123:23 - just like this okay but you could see
123:26 - also in the finished product that there
123:28 - was some icon here at the left before
123:30 - the name come so let us add that one and
123:33 - make the work complete let me cut this
123:36 - one here from from here for now and then
123:40 - what I want to do before I add the song
123:43 - is I'll add a k list widget
123:47 - item
123:49 - and then inside the Kess widget item I
123:52 - will add in two things K
123:57 - icon
124:00 - sorry I think I have to import that from
124:03 - somewhere let me see Pam on iover over
124:06 - it like this is to import it for me and
124:08 - if you don't have it be sure to import
124:09 - it from
124:12 - P5 and then for the icon I don't think I
124:16 - will have
124:17 - to
124:20 - sorry this is just redundance so for the
124:23 - icon I will just passing the path to the
124:25 - icon and if you come to the resource
124:28 - browser
124:34 - here and I expand this side you see when
124:37 - I click on the images all the images
124:39 - here I can copy the part so if I am
124:42 - looking for which one are we looking for
124:44 - we looking for this one if I click on it
124:46 - like this and copy path I will get the
124:48 - path to the resource file and that can
124:52 - also that which will come from the
124:54 - python file that we converted that is
124:56 - how the resource files work so I can
124:58 - just paste it in like this that is the
125:00 - path that we need and then the second
125:03 - argument here being the file name sorry
125:07 - sorry sorry sorry which is the os. path
125:11 - do base name of the
125:15 - file okay so that is why we didn't use
125:18 - add item or anything like that we just
125:20 - wanted toate each of them and then add
125:22 - this one
125:24 - okay so now if we add songs hopefully
125:27 - there shouldn't be any error but a
125:29 - beautiful thing here for us okay so that
125:33 - is it we have our songs loaded with a
125:35 - beautiful icon at the side there so the
125:37 - obvious step next that we have to do
125:40 - that is to play the song so let us get
125:43 - into the playing of that particular
125:45 - song again I will create another file
125:48 - for give me I'm creating so many files
125:50 - this will not be the last one but I
125:53 - usually create a phold so called songs
125:55 - where we keep uh some lists because we
125:58 - want to when we load the fil we want to
126:00 - load them into a list and then play from
126:03 - that particular list because our app
126:04 - will only display the the files name as
126:07 - it appears in the folder but we need a
126:08 - full part so we have to store the full
126:10 - part somewhere which I will do or we are
126:13 - doing with inside
126:15 - the the songs. py file so we just let's
126:18 - create two lists
126:20 - there the first one is
126:24 - current current
126:26 - song list and that should be an empty
126:30 - file an empty list sorry and then the
126:32 - second one that you want to create so
126:34 - that you don't come back to this file
126:35 - again is
126:38 - favorite um favorite let want be
126:41 - favorite songs
126:43 - list okay which is also an empty list
126:48 - just like this and then we can close it
126:52 - okay and so what we want to do is that
126:55 - before we add the file so for file in
126:58 - file we can now say
127:00 - songs songs dot uh no
127:06 - songs dot current song list do append
127:11 - you want to append the file to it so
127:14 - that we have it there be sure to import
127:16 - it most of these uh my that I do the P
127:20 - will import them for me automatically
127:22 - but if you're a different editor you may
127:25 - have to do the importation yourself so
127:26 - just keep track of that I'll will try my
127:29 - best to allert you anytime that has to
127:31 - happen so that you you can import them
127:35 - so now that we have it imported into
127:36 - that file then we can now go and call it
127:39 - and use it what happens is that if we
127:43 - now load songs like
127:46 - this when we click on it in this list
127:49 - widget we can use H get the current
127:53 - index or current selection from the song
127:55 - list widget or the index of the current
127:58 - selection from the song list widget and
128:00 - then we can use that particular index to
128:03 - access the full part of the file from
128:07 - the song list widget uh that we have
128:10 - created the empty list or which will now
128:12 - be filled with all of these things and
128:14 - so that we can use that one to index
128:16 - into it select it and then play it but
128:18 - before we can play the song we have to
128:20 - create a player object or appear
128:25 - somewhere okay so
128:36 - um self.
128:39 - player equal to K media
128:43 - player media sorry Q
128:47 - Media
128:49 - player and then be sure to import that
128:52 - one also from pqt 5. QT
128:55 - multimedia we can now come here and then
128:58 - add a new method that will play the
129:17 - songs okay
129:20 - now this one let's put it in a tri
129:22 - accept block I usually like to do that
129:25 - for applications like this especially
129:27 - when the code Bas will grow large it's
129:29 - good so that your application will not
129:31 - be crashing often in terms there's
129:34 - anything that will crashing then the try
129:36 - accept will save you from that so
129:39 - accept can say exception maybe as e we
129:44 - can now say like print and inside an F
129:47 - string we can try and print out
129:49 - something that will help us know where
129:50 - the application crashed so I can say
129:53 - Okay Play song error so that I know that
129:56 - the error is coming from the play on and
129:59 - then I can plug in E
130:01 - here inside here now I can write the
130:05 - functionality what we need to do to play
130:07 - a song is of course get a song which you
130:09 - do by the index so if you want to get
130:11 - the index is you can say current
130:13 - selection sorry
130:16 - current selection should be equal
130:21 - to self do loaded song list wiget uh not
130:27 - this one
130:28 - loaded songlist widget dot current
130:34 - rule this will give us the index of the
130:36 - current selection then we can later use
130:39 - in in assessing the file from the song
130:41 - list the list widget oh sorry the list
130:45 - not the list widget and then we can now
130:47 - see that current
130:50 - song now equals to
130:54 - songs. loaded song list widget how do
130:57 - you call it it's not loaded s or current
131:00 - song list wiget
131:02 - yeah and then we can now access the the
131:05 - one at the current
131:08 - selection when we have it like this then
131:11 - now we can go ahead and play the song
131:13 - what we have to do now is to create a
131:15 - URL that is our with work in by so sore
131:20 - URL that should be equal to K
131:27 - media content which should also come
131:33 - from
131:35 - pt5 QT
131:37 - multimedia so Q media content then Q
131:41 - URL which should also come
131:44 - from P
131:46 - cor okay and then you can say URL sorry
131:50 - Dot from local file because we are
131:53 - accessing it from our computer and then
131:56 - we can now see the current
131:58 - song so we get the new URL that will not
132:02 - be a problem for QT to play
132:05 - with then we can now say sub.
132:08 - player do set
132:11 - media set the media to the song
132:15 - URL and then we can now say s
132:19 - do
132:22 - player do
132:24 - playay okay this should play our song
132:27 - for us so let's just in
132:30 - anticipation oh I should connect it
132:33 - first I'm sure you guess that so where
132:35 - our connections are on the default page
132:38 - we can now say s do
132:43 - play Play song BTN or something like
132:46 - that or it's called play BTN play play
132:48 - BTN this
132:49 - one this is what we want to use so play
132:52 - BTN at the top here so play BTN do
132:56 - click do connect we want to connect it
133:00 - to self do Play
133:05 - song okay of course don't call it just
133:08 - let it be there like
133:09 - that and then now let's load a
133:14 - song I would like to this volume doesn't
133:17 - work for now but if I select life is a
133:22 - dream you see that now it is playing so
133:25 - we have done the basic thing that basic
133:27 - thing that application has to play a
133:30 - song I can't let me just close it so now
133:34 - we've done the basic thing let's us move
133:36 - ahead to now pause and unpause Our
133:40 - Song so that one should should
133:43 - go can say pause and un pause
133:48 - but before we do that let's just get
133:51 - some Global variables to keep track of
133:54 - certain States in our
133:56 - application I'll do them at the top here
133:58 - so after the player or before that I can
134:02 - now say globals and we will need Global
134:08 - stopped we will also
134:11 - need
134:13 - Global loop I just creating all of them
134:16 - so that we don't have to come back and
134:18 - ourselves and then we need a
134:21 - global is shuffled we want to keep track
134:24 - when we are playing the random we want
134:26 - to know whether it's shff or not so the
134:28 - initial states of this one should be
134:30 - that
134:32 - stopped is false when we start the
134:35 - application it cannot be stopped and
134:40 - loop I mean when you start application
134:42 - stop cannot be false that was what I was
134:43 - trying to say Loop is also false
134:45 - here this is not JavaScript is capital F
134:49 - and then is shuffled is also false so
134:51 - it's shuffled which is also equal to
134:54 - false okay then we can now use this to
134:58 - create our pause and on
135:09 - pause so
135:11 - here what we have to say is we want to
135:15 - we have to check whether there is a song
135:17 - playing and this is how we can do it in
135:19 - pqt we will just say that if
135:22 - self do
135:25 - player do state the player that we
135:28 - created out there if the state equal
135:31 - to Q sorry Q Media Player do playing
135:36 - state that means that the song is
135:39 - playing then we can say s self. player.
135:46 - pause else
135:50 - s.
135:51 - player. playay so that is the trick that
135:55 - should do the pause and on pause for
135:57 - us not something so
136:01 - difficult so we come up here do our
136:04 - connection where is
136:06 - it the but should be ser. Pa
136:11 - BTN do click do connect connect it for
136:17 - the s
136:18 - pause and on pause so now let's see
136:22 - whether we
136:25 - can pause and unpause the song as we
136:31 - play so Raising Me Higher
136:37 - Play you can hear that it's playing in
136:40 - the background if I click on this it has
136:42 - paused when I click on on pause it
136:44 - resumes and then it continues playing so
136:47 - yes this one to has been C for the
136:50 - obvious one that we contined is the next
136:53 - the stop so let's just create the
136:55 - connection here before we go down so uh
136:59 - can help by duplicating s dot we will
137:02 - call it stop
137:04 - song stop to obviously through an error
137:07 - because doesn't know that one so stop
137:10 - BTN that's is what
137:12 - will do that for us so let's come
137:16 - down
137:32 - and this one is quite quite simple so I
137:35 - also want to wrap this in the try sub
137:37 - blog because as we go ahead and then
137:40 - build the application a lot of things
137:42 - will be will have to be considered
137:44 - before stopping the application
137:45 - especially when we are playing from from
137:48 - different places like the playlist or
137:51 - the favorite tab instead of the actual
137:53 - or the default song list wiget so let me
137:56 - just safely wrap this one also in a tri
137:59 - block I do have some snippet in Pyon
138:02 - that help me and this place will be
138:05 - stop stop song
138:09 - error and here we can now come and say
138:12 - ser. player no player. store just as
138:18 - easy as that just as easy as that
138:32 - so feeling
138:35 - [Music]
138:38 - happy pause it on
138:42 - pause and then stop it has stopped it I
138:46 - we forgot a very important step the song
138:48 - name should go here and the song pass
138:50 - should go here this one should have been
138:52 - done when we hit the play button so
138:54 - let's do it and then get that one
138:58 - off where is our
139:00 - play
139:03 - okay after it's placed we can let's
139:06 - check their
139:07 - names yeah this is called the current
139:10 - song
139:13 - name then current song path
139:16 - okay
139:18 - so self dot sorry sorry
139:24 - current song name do set text that is
139:28 - how we can do it set text and we want to
139:31 - set it to it should be an F
139:35 - string os.
139:38 - path. base name of the
139:41 - file and then here we can just duplicate
139:45 - this and I think it's current
139:49 - song path and the only thing that we
139:51 - have to change in
139:53 - here why is it say oh okay okay okay I'm
139:57 - thinking that we are in the load songs
139:59 - so this one will
140:00 - be current
140:03 - song okay this one too should be current
140:09 - song
140:10 - okay and the only thing we have to
140:12 - change here is that the base name will
140:14 - not be D name that is it and that should
140:17 - fix it for us let's
140:19 - see so let's
140:24 - add okay life is a dream play and then
140:28 - we see life is a dream and then the four
140:30 - path is done there if I I play a happy
140:34 - Christmas that
140:36 - one for now this part is cated for
140:44 - okay but one more thing is that that you
140:47 - see that our slider is not moving when
140:51 - we uh Play the song we will work on that
140:54 - but let's first work on the volume
140:57 - control
140:59 - before we want to set an initial volume
141:02 - when the application start so let's do
141:05 - it here so
141:06 - self.
141:09 - initial
141:10 - volume let's set it to
141:13 - 20 so that our volume will be at 20 when
141:16 - the application starts
141:18 - and then
141:20 - here we can say um function to change
141:23 - the volume of something like that so
141:25 - function to
141:30 - change the
141:35 - volume volume you call it volume
141:39 - underscore
141:41 - change
141:43 - okay and this is where we also have to
141:46 - bringing a tri accept block because a
141:49 - lot of things can happen and this place
141:51 - we can just
141:53 - say volume change
142:00 - error sorry and here we can now
142:05 - say self dot current volume sorry sub
142:11 - dot current volume the one that we
142:14 - created up
142:16 - there
142:19 - do we call it initial volume or current
142:21 - volume initial volume okay should be
142:23 - equal to s dot volume D that is the name
142:29 - of the D itself so it's called volume d
142:32 - as you can see here so s. volume
142:36 - D do
142:38 - value and then what we want to do is
142:40 - that we serve set the name the volume to
142:45 - that value so self.
142:50 - player do set
142:52 - volume to self do current
142:56 - volume no sorry initial volume I don't
143:00 - know how keep
143:02 - on
143:04 - wow okay so this should work but in the
143:08 - case where application starts we want to
143:11 - just make sure that the volume is at 20
143:12 - so I think this line can come in very
143:15 - handy at the top there also
143:17 - so just immediately uh beneath the place
143:21 - where we decare the
143:23 - volume where is that one okay so that we
143:26 - know for sure that that is it okay when
143:29 - it runs at
143:30 - first and it seem to be something wrong
143:35 - here uh okay we also have to set the
143:38 - value of this text and then there they
143:41 - handle to the 20 so let's do that one
143:46 - also
143:48 - give a space here and then we can now
143:51 - say s do volume
143:55 - D dot uh set value or something like
143:58 - that
144:00 - to set self do initial
144:05 - volume and then s. volume label this one
144:10 - the label on top of the dial do set text
144:15 - want to set the text to F string just to
144:18 - be save and then we want to set it to
144:20 - the initial volume s. initial volume
144:24 - okay let's run it and
144:27 - see okay then now everything works out
144:30 - like we wanted to so we can add songs
144:35 - and then play around with the
144:40 - volume it is play first I increase it I
144:45 - I hope you hear it
144:47 - L and then now let me play this one
144:51 - [Music]
144:57 - rather okay I think there's a problem
144:59 - somewhere this thing may not really be
145:07 - working let's comment out this line cuz
145:10 - my volume was not actually
145:13 - increasing we still have the 20 set now
145:16 - let's see if the volume will increase I
145:18 - think they should be able to filter all
145:19 - these ones out yes it did so
145:25 - [Music]
145:38 - 20
145:40 - okay I don't think it is still
145:42 - increasing let me just comment out these
145:44 - ones oh and I I think you guessed the
145:47 - reason I think you've guessed the reason
145:49 - and that is because we have not made a
145:52 - connection you have not really made a
145:54 - connection to uh that particular
145:56 - function that we we created down there
145:59 - that is very very very off things like
146:01 - that do happen so forgive me how we do
146:04 - this connection is a bit different from
146:06 - what we have seen so far and we can just
146:09 - go self. volume
146:12 - d dot value change this one we not
146:15 - looking for the click we looking for
146:17 - value chain do
146:19 - connect what we want to do here is that
146:22 - we want to pass in
146:24 - Lambda because it is has it has to be
146:27 - listening always keeping track of the
146:30 - particular value that the values will be
146:33 - changing as we turn the out so it have
146:35 - to be able to keep track of it and then
146:37 - use it so that's why we pass in the
146:38 - Lambda and then s dot volume changed and
146:43 - for this one you bring in the
146:45 - parenthesis like we are calling the
146:47 - function that's also one of the reasons
146:48 - we are bringing in the Lambda because if
146:50 - you have to pass any value here then the
146:52 - Lambda should be here but in this case
146:55 - the value will be gotten for
146:57 - us the D itself knows how to return it
146:59 - and so we can use that for our
147:06 - player okay so now if I
147:10 - play okay now the volume goes high for
147:15 - me
147:17 - [Music]
147:18 - very low then High okay so our volume
147:22 - dial is also
147:23 - working uh the next obvious thing that
147:26 - we have to do is to get this slider to
147:28 - be moving with a song and so let us get
147:32 - to that part and then see how that one
147:35 - also
147:37 - goes for that one we
147:39 - will create another one another function
147:43 - here to move the
147:45 - slider
147:48 - I want us to bring it to this place just
147:51 - after the function to handle the mouse
147:53 - position
147:54 - so function to move the slider sorry the
148:01 - slider okay and this is how we move the
148:04 - slider we will get the position the
148:08 - length of the song itself sorry and we
148:11 - will set the length of the slider to the
148:15 - length of the song in seconds of of
148:18 - course and then we will now be keeping
148:21 - track every 1 second move the slider by
148:24 - 1 second every one second get the
148:26 - position move it and then move the
148:28 - slider handle to that position so this
148:31 - particular function that we we about to
148:33 - create will be connected to something
148:34 - like a timer so that at at every 1
148:37 - second it will get the current position
148:39 - of the song it also knows the full
148:41 - duration of the song and so it
148:44 - will set the slider length the full
148:47 - duration of the song and then get the
148:50 - current position of the song every
148:53 - second and use that current position to
148:57 - set the place where the handle should be
149:01 - I don't know whether I've been able to
149:02 - explain it well but I think the code
149:03 - will do the explanation better so let us
149:07 - get into the writing so we Define move _
149:12 - slider and
149:14 - then we can see that if
149:20 - stopped
149:22 - return you remember the the stopped
149:25 - Global that we we created up there so if
149:29 - stopped that is then we have to return
149:32 - because if the song is STO this thing
149:34 - should not even be moving in the first
149:36 - place and then we can say
149:40 - else can now update the
149:45 - slider then we can say if self do
149:51 - player do
149:53 - state you know the song can be playing
149:56 - for a while and then it will be paused
149:57 - so at that time that it has not been
149:59 - paused the slider is still moving but if
150:01 - it is paused you also have to pause the
150:03 - slider so we have to keep check of that
150:04 - so now Q Media Player this one you have
150:07 - seen it before you know that you are
150:08 - trying to get the state of the player
150:11 - and then we can just say that playing
150:12 - State then that is if and only if it is
150:16 - play if it is PA don't do
150:18 - it then self. music slider that is the
150:24 - name of the slider here you see s. music
150:29 - slider so s. music slider dot set
150:35 - minimum not minimum size set minimum
150:38 - here to zero and then I know you've
150:42 - guessed the The Next Step so s do music
150:45 - slider do set
150:49 - maximum to the duration of the song
150:52 - which you can get
150:54 - byself do
150:57 - player do
150:59 - duration and they all come in handy with
151:01 - pqt we don't have to uh write them
151:05 - ourselves so we have set now the
151:06 - duration also and then we can now see
151:09 - that the slider
151:13 - position should be equal to s 12 do
151:18 - player do position what this one will do
151:21 - is it will give us the current position
151:23 - where the song is is is playing and then
151:26 - we can use that
151:28 - one okay so in order to let you know
151:30 - what actually is happening here let me
151:32 - now try and then print the duration
151:36 - so
151:37 - duration oh sorry I forgot the F
151:43 - string the duration here will be
151:48 - self do player dot
151:52 - duration
151:54 - okay and then the next thing I want to
151:56 - print is the um current time so let's
152:00 - just let me just say current and then
152:01 - that is
152:03 - the slider
152:06 - position and let's leave it for now
152:09 - remember I told you that before this one
152:11 - work we have to now connect it to uh
152:15 - timer
152:19 - so let's come up here
152:22 - where a lot of things are going on up
152:24 - here but we can bring it after before
152:27 - the connection
152:28 - so
152:30 - slider
152:32 - timer and then we can now say that self
152:35 - do
152:37 - timer equal to K
152:41 - timer it comes with pt5 so you can
152:44 - overover import it from P5 QT call up
152:50 - here where were we where were we yeah
152:54 - and then what we want to do is we have
152:56 - to pass in self here sorry what we want
152:59 - to do here is that self. timer do
153:07 - start and I will put in here 1,000 which
153:10 - is 1 second it measures it in
153:13 - millisecond so that is that will be 1
153:14 - second so that means that every 1 second
153:17 - do what we are telling you to do and now
153:19 - you remember you have to create a
153:20 - connection to it Ser do
153:23 - timer do timeout this is how we create
153:26 - this one's connection so timeout and
153:29 - then we want to now
153:31 - connect it
153:34 - to the function that you created down
153:37 - there which is called self. move
153:39 - slider
153:41 - yeah again we don't have to bring this
153:43 - parenthesis so when we run it now bring
153:46 - up my because you'll be seeing some
153:48 - numbers down
153:57 - here okay so feeling happy let me just
154:00 - play
154:00 - [Music]
154:05 - it okay okay so you see that the values
154:08 - are this value which is the duration is
154:10 - constant you can see it from here and
154:13 - then this value which is the current is
154:16 - increasing by 1,000 so that is the
154:19 - calling of the timer so you see that
154:20 - this is 1599 2599 3599 but the duration
154:24 - stays the same so that is what we'll be
154:26 - doing so at every 1 second what we do is
154:29 - that we move the slider handle to this
154:32 - current positions and then the length
154:35 - will be the same so it to be like a
154:37 - fixed length but a moving handle and
154:39 - that is the trick that we are trying to
154:42 - use here right our slider we are doing
154:45 - more of of course than printing it so
154:47 - let's get rid of this and then what we
154:51 - can say is the self. music
154:53 - [Music]
154:58 - slider set value just as simple as that
155:02 - and we set the value to the slider
155:03 - position because that's the current
155:15 - position
155:18 - [Music]
155:21 - and then you can see that our slider is
155:23 - now moving but you can see that this one
155:26 - nearly tricked us into thinking that the
155:28 - slider is not moving so let's fix that
155:31 - one the time should be
155:33 - changing minimize this one what is the
155:36 - problem
155:41 - here and then this is what we want to do
155:44 - so here we change let me give a comment
155:46 - so
155:48 - change how do you call that on this ones
155:50 - is it time labels or something like that
155:52 - okay so what we want to do is that you
155:55 - saw the the way it's printed it in the
155:57 - terminal that is not a way that will be
156:00 - user friendly for us we have to convert
156:02 - it to the regular hour minutes and
156:05 - seconds that we know so this is how we
156:08 - go about it we can say
156:11 - current current time that should be
156:13 - equal
156:14 - to time which comes by with python is
156:19 - Def python so Str strf time we want this
156:23 - one and then the format that you want to
156:26 - use that uh at the top here say you type
156:29 - in the format the format here let me use
156:32 - double strings here is percentage
156:35 - H now represented H percentage
156:40 - M and then percentage s this is just the
156:44 - hour minutes and seconds if you want it
156:46 - in a different way you can format it
156:48 - that way and then now time do local time
156:53 - and then what is the particular time
156:55 - that you want to convert this format it
156:57 - is the self do
157:01 - player dot position sorry sorry sorry
157:05 - yeah there is the position and then we
157:07 - want to divide it by
157:10 - 1,000 remember it's a it's a millisecond
157:13 - is a microc also so you have to divide
157:15 - it and
157:16 - then we can also get a song duration but
157:20 - just by duplicating this line and then
157:22 - the only thing that we have to change
157:23 - here is the
157:26 - duration okay so this will give us the
157:28 - current time in a format that is easily
157:31 - readable and then this will also give us
157:34 - the no this should be the uh should not
157:38 - be current time it should be song
157:43 - duration okay I can go ahead and print
157:45 - this one to the screen for you to know
157:47 - the terminal for you to know what is
157:48 - happening but I think if you you
157:51 - understand what is being done here just
157:53 - formatting the time and then after we do
157:55 - that you can just say Ser do time label
157:59 - that is the
158:00 - name do set
158:03 - text going to set the text in an F
158:06 - string so what will count first is the
158:10 - current
158:12 - time and then we leave a slash like this
158:15 - and then we now bring in the song
158:18 - duration and this should also work for
158:21 - us let's test it out and
158:25 - see okay so bring it up bring it up
158:28 - bring it
158:30 - up raing me
158:32 - [Music]
158:34 - higher and then now we have our slider
158:37 - working correctly and but for every
158:42 - professional music player application
158:44 - you know that we should have the
158:47 - flexibility of
158:50 - moving excuse me of moving to any
158:52 - particular position in the song and have
158:54 - it playing from there but you see that
158:57 - this is not proving very stubborn when I
158:59 - move it it comes back because every
159:01 - second it is checking the position and
159:04 - fixing that position so how do you make
159:06 - it such that it actually also gets if I
159:09 - move it here it will stay there and then
159:11 - continue playing from if I un pause now
159:13 - it should come back to where it was uh
159:16 - so let's fix that one also that is quite
159:19 - quite easy we don't even have to write
159:21 - our own code for that we have to just
159:23 - create some simple connection for
159:28 - it so up here I still have a default
159:32 - page that's where we
159:34 - are we can let's bring it at the top
159:37 - that should be self
159:39 - do music
159:42 - slider do slider moved sler move this
159:46 - was what we are looking for and then we
159:48 - want to take it as an
159:51 - integer and then we can now see do
159:54 - connect what do we want to connect it to
159:57 - I'm sorry for all the background
159:59 - noise why they just down there making
160:01 - noise okay now we want to connect it
160:06 - to Lambda because we are come to write a
160:10 - function that will take an input so
160:14 - Lambda and then serve do
160:20 - player dot set
160:24 - position I now want to set the you see
160:27 - initially we getting the position I want
160:29 - to set the position so that you continue
160:30 - from there and then what you have to
160:32 - pass yourself
160:34 - dot music
160:37 - slider do value so the value that you
160:41 - have not moved to get it and set it that
160:43 - way rather so let's see how how it
160:59 - goes and so now you can see it is
161:02 - playing if I move it here stops and it
161:04 - continues from there so I can bring it
161:06 - back then it stops and continues from
161:08 - there
161:09 - so that is what I was talking about to
161:12 - make this one uh behave professional way
161:16 - like the professional players do and so
161:19 - of course you have BR on Advanced
161:20 - players so if you have these features
161:23 - okay so the next thing that you have to
161:24 - do here on this page is to get this
161:29 - delete get this delete one and then
161:31 - delete all to work so let's work on that
161:34 - one then we know that we are done we can
161:36 - move to the the different one which is
161:38 - the playlist and then onward to the
161:41 - favorite I think we do the favorite
161:42 - first before the playlist each of them
161:44 - any of them should be
161:46 - okay oh we have not worked also on the
161:49 - next previous okay we work on that one
161:52 - but since I've mentioned this or let's
161:54 - just finish this ones the next the
161:56 - previous and this ones
162:00 - before okay so that'll be play next song
162:05 - for the start the idea of this is quite
162:07 - quite simple you just get the current
162:09 - rule uh in the selected widget that is
162:12 - playing and then add one to it use it as
162:16 - an index and then F the full song part
162:20 - from our songs. current song list list
162:23 - and then play that one that is just how
162:25 - we want to do so and so let us see how
162:30 - that one go so
162:33 - Define nextore
162:36 - song and then let's just say that this
162:40 - is also a place where we have to put
162:44 - tricept
162:48 - okay so next song
162:55 - error here we can now see that the song
163:01 - index equals which is the the current
163:04 - song that is playing so that should be
163:06 - or the current selection of the of the
163:10 - song list widget so that should be S do
163:13 - loaded songlist widget
163:16 - current
163:19 - row okay and then we can now say nextore
163:24 - index should now be equal to song
163:33 - index and then we have to add one to it
163:36 - and then we can now see that next song
163:39 - or is it I think we can get a lot of
163:42 - things from our play
163:44 - here I this things should remain the
163:48 - same let's just go down down down and
163:52 - then paste it in so the next
164:03 - song should not be equal to songs do
164:09 - song list and the next
164:13 - index so all that we have to do here is
164:16 - all this we have to change them to
164:21 - okay you have to change it to next one
164:23 - so next
164:36 - song okay so this should work for us and
164:41 - yeah let's see how it
164:44 - goes
164:55 - okay sorry
164:56 - s so I'm playing life is a dream now if
165:00 - I play nextest bring up my
165:05 - volume oh and I know you know because we
165:08 - have not connected we have not made a
165:09 - connection so let's go up here and now
165:12 - say that s do
165:16 - next
165:17 - BTN do
165:20 - click do connect want to connect it to
165:23 - s. next song without the
165:27 - parenthesis and then let's
165:31 - see most of the times when I'm building
165:33 - this QT apps I forget to make the
165:35 - connection I just forget to make the
165:37 - connection and then I'll have to come
165:39 - back again so now life is a dream is
165:42 - playing have you noticed that this Alum
165:44 - is not changing
165:45 - [Music]
165:48 - okay and never play
165:50 - [Music]
165:53 - next it is play raising me higher but
165:56 - you see that it's thetion is still on
166:00 - life is a dream and that is a big
166:02 - problem because next time you play
166:03 - nextest it will use this index to still
166:05 - play this Raising Me Higher let us fix
166:07 - that
166:09 - one what we can do is that after we play
166:11 - the song um after everything oh no
166:15 - so let me get back to this after we play
166:20 - the song or after we yes after we play
166:23 - the song obviously so we can just Ser do
166:26 - loaded song list
166:28 - widget do Set current
166:31 - Ru uh this one set the current row to
166:36 - the next
166:44 - index
166:48 - so now feeling
166:53 - happy best and it Place life is is a
166:55 - dream and then moves the the selection
166:58 - to that one
167:00 - and to Raising Me Higher also and now to
167:03 - take Vibes I was expecting that I should
167:05 - get an error if I click on next again
167:09 - yes it is inside here this thing this is
167:12 - out of range but app didn't crash
167:14 - because
167:15 - [Music]
167:16 - try the TR that we use that the error
167:20 - for us and that is why I really
167:22 - encourage you to use that one we will
167:24 - fix this one very soon so that when it
167:26 - gets to the end of the queue it
167:28 - automatically restart but for now let's
167:30 - see how it
167:32 - goes okay so I know you've thought of
167:34 - the previous which should be just like
167:38 - this one but you subtract one from it so
167:41 - permit me to just copy everything like
167:44 - this
167:58 - and then let's change all the next stuff
168:00 - to
168:03 - previous if you using Pon and wondering
168:06 - why I'm doing all the selection at once
168:08 - it's alternative J will do that for you
168:11 - so previous song and here we just
168:14 - subtract
168:16 - one but of course you have not made a
168:19 - connection so let's go up there I'm very
168:21 - sorry for the occasional background
168:22 - noise I don't know why they are now
168:24 - standing they're making noise so can now
168:26 - say previous
168:30 - song and then this one should be
168:33 - previous
168:35 - BTN
168:43 - yep
168:48 - [Music]
168:56 - so now we know that this are stuff are
168:58 - also
168:59 - [Music]
169:01 - working for the
169:03 - previous it kind of works when you get
169:06 - to the top and you hit previous it's
169:08 - actually playing Tech house
169:10 - Vibes but it's not selected you can see
169:12 - from here that it's playing Tech house
169:13 - Vibes f
169:16 - now playing raising me higher when I get
169:19 - to but it doesn't go again yeah
169:23 - just when it gets
169:25 - to very happy Christmas check it when I
169:28 - click previous to play check out just
169:32 - that and I don't know how able to do
169:35 - that and not do it for the next but we
169:36 - will get all of them sorted out very
169:40 - soon okay so you can see from there that
169:43 - what we are left to do next is to play
169:48 - uh have the shuffle the loop one and
169:51 - then the random play but I also want to
169:54 - draw your attention to something for a
169:56 - professional grd application like this
169:58 - you don't want to play the next and the
170:01 - previous song based on a selection it is
170:04 - not so professional at all and this is
170:07 - what I'm trying to say if I click on
170:10 - feeling happy and I start playing it and
170:13 - then I mistakenly come again and click
170:15 - on a very happy Christmas or let me see
170:18 - raing me
170:19 - higher and I click on the next button it
170:23 - is plain feeling
170:25 - happy and so I expect that the next song
170:28 - will be live is a dream not Tech house
170:30 - Vibes because if we base our Nest based
170:34 - on the selection then we have to be
170:35 - playing Tech house Vibes instead of life
170:37 - is a dream so let me show you a way to
170:40 - get around that and make this app even
170:42 - more
170:43 - professional where our next song is
170:46 - let's come to the
170:47 - function and then we will now have to
170:50 - get the current song and this is how we
170:53 - get it for now I'll maintain this ones
170:56 - for now and I'll now
170:58 - say current
171:01 - media that should be self.
171:06 - player. media you remember that when we
171:09 - are
171:10 - playing where is
171:11 - it where is the place we set the song
171:14 - yes reset media so we can get the media
171:17 - so this one will give us the name of the
171:20 - or the that the thing that is
171:22 - playing and um for now let me show you
171:26 - why I'll do what I'm doing so
171:30 - current uh this is the current song URL
171:35 - should be equal
171:37 - to current media sorry sorry sorry
171:40 - current
171:42 - media what is wrong with my typing con
171:44 - current media. Canon URL this one and
171:50 - then we can access the thought part but
171:54 - let's just pause let's just comment
171:57 - everything and then let me show you what
171:59 - we are do I don't want it to be typ in
172:02 - blindly so oh I didn't do actually what
172:05 - I wanted to do so I can now
172:09 - print the current song
172:12 - URL sweet
172:29 - next I don't think it didn't mind me
172:32 - okay it did so this is what we get from
172:34 - the canonical
172:36 - URL it brings up a q URL
172:40 - objects uh it's opening when I click it
172:44 - is open it on my my my default player on
172:47 - my system so we have to get this URL
172:52 - inside and so how we do that is to just
172:55 - to say the path just give us the path
172:59 - that is what we want so let's see how it
173:01 - goes now
173:13 - also
173:15 - and you see that we we have a path
173:19 - here but there's something wrong usually
173:22 - you see you see the part here that is
173:24 - running the
173:25 - file it doesn't start with a
173:28 - backlash so if we try to feed this one
173:31 - in as a path there is a high chance that
173:33 - this thing might through an error it may
173:36 - give a problem fine we can we may able
173:38 - to use the OS model to normalize or is
173:41 - it the nor path what is normalized path
173:43 - but there's a nor path here that we can
173:45 - use but why not just put an use Python
173:49 - indexing to get from position one up to
173:53 - the end so this one will just forget the
173:55 - zero one which is this and then get us
173:58 - from the one which is the C to the end
174:00 - and that will give us the four part if
174:01 - we try this one
174:10 - [Music]
174:12 - again now super clean that we can use in
174:16 - our program and so you know that we now
174:20 - have to compare this
174:23 - path to the existing files which are in
174:27 - songs. py where is that one this one the
174:31 - songs should be loaded here so what you
174:33 - have to do is to compare get the index
174:36 - this particular path will be inside this
174:39 - song because the song is part of what we
174:40 - loaded so all that we have to do is that
174:43 - get the index of this this path or this
174:46 - song inside this particular list widget
174:49 - list sorry I keep on confusing them with
174:51 - list wiget inside this list and then
174:54 - when we get that index we can now use
174:56 - that index to play the next song I don't
175:00 - know whether I'm explaining it as I
175:03 - ought to but I hope and I do hope that
175:05 - you understand so let us get to the
175:07 - writing of the code that one will do the
175:09 - job
175:10 - better so all these things are not
175:15 - uh there some of them will be useful uh
175:17 - so this one of course will not be
175:21 - useful what we need to do here is that
175:24 - the song index now
175:28 - becomes song list which the current
175:31 - row this current row will go away and
175:34 - then we can now say do index which is
175:37 - which means that
175:40 - uh song current song with index want to
175:44 - find the index of the current song URL I
175:49 - this
175:51 - one is the right thing that I'm
175:55 - doing no this is not the right
175:58 - thing it should
176:00 - be
176:02 - songs dot current songl do index of that
176:07 - and that is y so this should do the
176:10 - trick let me
176:13 - see
176:18 - so I will be playing feeling
176:21 - happy but I I'll intentionally select
176:26 - the raising me higher and still go next
176:29 - so if what we did is correct then you
176:32 - should play Life as a dream and not take
176:34 - housewi and of course it is playing Life
176:37 - as a dream if I select a very happy
176:38 - Christmas and go next but is still playe
176:41 - Raising Me Higher because that is the
176:43 - song so congratulations now your
176:45 - application is professional grade one so
176:49 - we still building it we still need this
176:51 - particular piece of code remember in the
176:53 - previous
176:54 - also so um where did we get to so let's
176:58 - just paste it and see where we have to
177:00 - do the
177:06 - edits this particular one should go and
177:10 - this one to should work just like
177:13 - that
177:19 - so for instance if I play Tech house
177:22 - Vibes and then put my car on feeling
177:25 - happy I would not expect the previous to
177:28 - play a very happy Christmas but raising
177:30 - me
177:30 - high and another did
177:34 - work so irrespective of the selection we
177:37 - still have this thing playing out
177:40 - nicely and that is great so what we have
177:43 - to do now is to see whether the song is
177:47 - um whether how to play the how to Loop
177:51 - only one song and how to play
177:54 - random for that one I would want us to
177:57 - modify this next song a
177:59 - bit
178:02 - so we will keep this function but it
178:04 - will not be this and then so for now I
178:07 - want you to First copy or cut everything
178:11 - that you have in here don't worry we
178:13 - will place it very
178:15 - and then before the next song this
178:20 - function I want us to
178:22 - create two more functions or even three
178:27 - the first one we call it the default
178:35 - next for now let's do it this
178:42 - way
178:45 - and then this one will
178:50 - be looped
178:52 - next and then this one will be sorry
178:57 - shuffled
178:59 - next okay so what we are trying to
179:03 - achieve here is that if uh the default
179:09 - next at any point in time only one of
179:11 - these next functions will render and
179:14 - that is that depends on what the state
179:16 - of our application is so if the person
179:19 - has clicked on the
179:21 - loop uh loop one button then it's the
179:24 - loop next function that will render if
179:27 - the person has clicked on the random or
179:28 - the shuffle then it's that one that will
179:30 - play other than that is the default Nest
179:33 - so this function that this code that we
179:35 - did cut we have to now place it in here
179:38 - so you can say
179:40 - default
179:41 - next error
179:46 - and then safely paste it in so that will
179:48 - be our default next now let us work on
179:52 - the looped nest for the looped Nest it
179:55 - wouldn't be so different from the
179:58 - default nest in fact if we let's just
180:00 - say
180:02 - Loop
180:05 - next and then paste it in you just made
180:08 - some slight
180:09 - modifications so for that
180:12 - one we don't even need to bother
180:15 - ourselves with all of this
180:20 - because uh but there's a high chance
180:23 - that a person
180:26 - will will click on the loop and then
180:29 - make a different selection from
180:32 - the make a select a different song from
180:35 - the list other than the one that is
180:36 - playing so we still of course need our
180:38 - Canal URL but this time around we will
180:42 - not add any next Index this is not
180:49 - needed it will rather be song
180:57 - index I hope I've not confused anyone
181:00 - because we still need a song that is
181:01 - playing so that if the person select
181:03 - another song we still have that song to
181:05 - play and
181:07 - then uh this
181:10 - one I don't think this should be next
181:12 - song of course the variable naming will
181:15 - not do so much of a hand but it will not
181:18 - make the code that readable so you can
181:21 - say song instead of the next
181:25 - song I think this feature oh this that
181:28 - cool feature in P time I thought it will
181:30 - help me and let me delete all of this I
181:33 - cannot use that my shortcut here because
181:35 - there's chance that to select another
181:36 - guest somewhere that I didn't intend it
181:41 - to okay so this should work for the
181:45 - looped nest and then for the shuffled
181:49 - Nest where is that
181:50 - [Music]
181:52 - one shouldn't also be
181:55 - so different from this one just that uh
181:59 - for that one still to try accept to be
182:02 - safe so shuffled next
182:09 - error do we need a current media no
182:12 - because this one we play it in
182:15 - random so we have to delete this
182:19 - two and then we can this is it
182:23 - so uh song Index this one we we don't
182:26 - even need up to this point delete up to
182:28 - this point we don't need it the next
182:31 - song is should be a random figure so we
182:36 - can now see that the
182:38 - next index
182:40 - here that's you're making reference to
182:43 - here should be random So Random which is
182:46 - a module that comes with python by
182:48 - default So Random dot you want the Rand
182:51 - in we want an integer we are using
182:53 - integers to do the indexing so run in
182:56 - and then we have to declare from we want
182:57 - it from
182:58 - zero
183:00 - to I should be with the length of the
183:03 - song list which the song list if I say
183:07 - the song list without adding widgets I'm
183:09 - referring to the one in here so I may
183:12 - not say currents all the time
183:14 - that why I'm still referring to
183:17 - it so that up to the length of the song
183:22 - do current song list so any number from
183:27 - A to B it can be the number that we pass
183:31 - in for the song to play so that is it
183:34 - also for this one it shouldn't really be
183:37 - a problem but how do we know
183:40 - that how do we know I think there's an
183:42 - error somewhere
183:46 - like one
183:58 - arrow in then inspected that
184:01 - line oh okay okay okay okay I get it I
184:04 - get it there should be an arrow there
184:05 - there should be an arrow there that's
184:06 - what we are going to do now so inside
184:09 - here let's see we have to call the
184:11 - globals that we use
184:14 - Global
184:16 - loot remember
184:19 - Global isore
184:23 - shuffled we use
184:25 - them and then we just check so if it's
184:29 - shuffled then s do shuffled
184:35 - next a
184:38 - leave
184:39 - [Music]
184:40 - Loop then s do I know you've guessed it
184:44 - so it's look
184:45 - next
184:47 - else no I leave
184:50 - else s do default next so if it is
184:55 - looped do this if it is Shuffle do this
184:58 - if it is not then it's the default n
185:00 - that you want to play but as it stands
185:03 - now we don't have any function that
185:05 - keeps track of the uh
185:08 - changes keeps track or tells us whether
185:12 - our song has been loed or it has not
185:14 - been looped so let's just create those
185:17 - functions here down
185:20 - there or they should even come before
185:24 - there anyway should Dobe after this
185:31 - ones just want to make sure that they
185:34 - okay I think I stopped giving comments
185:35 - it's not
185:37 - good so function to Loop the song
185:45 - okay Define
185:49 - Loop
185:51 - one
185:53 - song
185:56 - okay so for this one it's always good I
185:59 - like this try except forgive me but it's
186:01 - a good practice I must tell you it's it
186:04 - saves you that if you get an error in
186:07 - such an application we be getting close
186:09 - to like 1,000 lines if you get an error
186:11 - without this gu it's it's difficult
186:13 - sometimes to figure it out some of the
186:15 - error will not even show at the at the
186:18 - terminal it just says Exit code is some
186:20 - large number and then you now know don't
186:22 - know where to fix it so these things
186:24 - really come in handy looping song
186:28 - error and then what we will do is we
186:32 - still need a global so
186:35 - Global is
186:38 - Shuffle and then we need a
186:41 - global loot
186:45 - Lo
186:47 - okay and then now we can see say if not
186:52 - [Music]
186:54 - loot
186:57 - then uh let me explain what we are doing
187:01 - here here let me pass for
187:04 - now if I run this thing
187:08 - now when I click on this to check it
187:14 - I shouldn't be able to click on this one
187:15 - too at the same
187:17 - time the buttons have been set such that
187:20 - they can be checked that's why they I
187:21 - check and I should have these two so if
187:25 - I click on this
187:26 - one only this one then this one should
187:28 - be disabled so I can't click on
187:31 - it but if I come and click on it here
187:34 - still being stop on then this one should
187:36 - now be disabled so it should just be
187:38 - switching between the
187:39 - two that is what you're trying to do
187:41 - here so if not
187:44 - looped and then you can say looped it's
187:48 - not
187:49 - true sorry
187:52 - true and then what we want to also do
187:54 - let me bring this thing down so that you
187:56 - can have view of most of the code in the
188:00 - viewport and then now you can say s do
188:06 - Shuffle um it's called shuffle songs BTN
188:09 - yes it's just right there shuffle songs
188:12 - BTN do set
188:16 - enabled to
188:18 - false so you can't click on it
188:22 - again
188:24 - else
188:26 - Loop is
188:30 - false and then
188:32 - sorry
188:34 - self do
188:36 - shaffle BTN do set enabled this time
188:41 - around to true
188:43 - so this is the idea behind it and we
188:46 - need a similar thing for the shuffle so
188:49 - let me just okay copy this one in
188:54 - here yep we need it down there
188:59 - so function
189:03 - to
189:05 - shuffle
189:07 - um Shuffle the songs or something like
189:11 - that so we want to
189:13 - Define Shuffle
189:17 - sorry
189:19 - shuffle uncore
189:25 - playlist and then P this in but what we
189:29 - be
189:30 - doing uh is to just be changing this
189:33 - Loop into a
189:41 - shuffle again with my shortcut
189:43 - alternative J I think uh that is for
189:46 - Windows on Mac there should be the that
189:48 - equivalent the same thing and then here
189:51 - will be Loop 1 BTN so Loop 1 BTN that is
189:56 - the name that we gave in the UR file so
189:59 - if you change it just be sure that you
190:02 - use those names appropriately so if I
190:06 - click on it to see lo.
190:08 - BTN if I shuffle I shuffle songs BTN is
190:13 - there
190:16 - okay so for the shaffle it prevents the
190:19 - loop button for the loop it prevents the
190:21 - shuffle button and what is so get an
190:25 - eror we can
190:29 - Shuffling no that should do and now we
190:32 - have to connect them up
190:40 - here so s
190:47 - do
190:49 - shle this shffle s bn.
190:53 - click do connect want to connect it to
190:57 - s.
190:58 - shaffle
191:00 - playlist and then in
191:03 - similar Mana s do uh loop 1 BTN do
191:11 - click do connect
191:14 - we want to connect it to sal. Loop one
191:19 - song so let's try it out and
191:24 - see now if I click on this you see that
191:26 - when I bring my ke on usually when it is
191:29 - active the K should be a pointer and the
191:31 - hover effect should happen but when I
191:33 - bring it is that it's not so I cannot
191:35 - click on this until I uncheck
191:38 - this where is it I uncheck it before I
191:43 - can come and click on this and now this
191:45 - one to I can't even click if I click on
191:47 - it it will not deactivate this yes but
191:51 - you can bring in that log that if a
191:53 - person comes to click here it will
191:55 - deactivate this one that is set the the
191:59 - the global or the variable to false and
192:02 - then now activate this one but I will't
192:04 - do that in this build but I think you
192:08 - get the the explanation I was trying to
192:10 - give if you wanted that way you can now
192:13 - be setting the states here so but that
192:16 - will make the condition a little deep
192:19 - and complex but I think I'm okay with
192:22 - how it looks like
192:23 - now what is left is that we have to now
192:27 - try the The Nest playing of the nest
192:31 - actually we are just testing the butons
192:34 - my songs are not many so that random may
192:37 - not really play like we want it to but
192:39 - let's just
192:41 - see
192:43 - so I'll click on this and then now press
192:46 - next okay I know immediately that it did
192:49 - work because Escape life is a play
192:53 - Raising Me Higher let me see playing
192:55 - feeling happy again how is this F okay
192:58 - now it's playing a very happy
193:00 - Christmas again it's playing it again
193:03 - again again again again so now we know
193:05 - that the random works at least because
193:07 - my songs are very small if you have
193:10 - plenty songs that should do
193:17 - [Music]
193:20 - and then I think we should check the
193:22 - loop also so I'll play feeling happy
193:27 - now and then and check this when it is
193:29 - lo let me click next it started playing
193:33 - again you can see that I clicked it not
193:35 - that I didn't I just put the I not click
193:37 - I clicked it because you know that the
193:39 - sler started again at zero but this time
193:41 - around it's still playing feeling happy
193:44 - you can see that again start at zero so
193:47 - our Loop is also working work on it for
193:49 - the previous
193:52 - song the previe song doesn't really
193:56 - doesn't
193:57 - need no no the previous doesn't need
194:00 - those things doesn't need those things
194:03 - but you can also testify that for some
194:07 - of
194:09 - the music players we have out there
194:13 - when the song gets to the end of the
194:14 - line it kind of plays the next song
194:17 - unless maybe the user set some settings
194:22 - not to let that happen
194:25 - and because we are building an advanced
194:28 - player we can do that also so now if I
194:31 - click on feeling
194:33 - [Music]
194:38 - happy I just want you to get to the end
194:40 - of the song end of
194:43 - the like you should finish
194:46 - playing now it's
194:49 - done but you can see that there is still
194:51 - some one second here to to be Ked for
194:54 - but in the in the in the memory or in
194:57 - the brain of QT this is done so what we
195:01 - can do is that there are two ways but
195:03 - I'll show you what to work
195:05 - best the first way is that we can check
195:08 - so if this time here you remember we
195:11 - were printing some and um the current
195:14 - time in our terminal so we can just say
195:17 - that if the two are the same then go to
195:19 - the next
195:20 - song but we just saw from here I've
195:24 - draged this ladder to the very end I
195:26 - don't know whether your end it will work
195:28 - but mine is still showing 227 instead of
195:31 - 228 so instead of worrying ourselves
195:33 - with getting these durations to March we
195:36 - can easily write one function by the
195:39 - help of QT and this thing will be C for
195:48 - so that function I will put it before
195:51 - the move
195:55 - slider and I can
195:58 - say function to
196:05 - determine the end of the
196:10 - song but as I said you can also manually
196:13 - go around this one and compare the times
196:18 - but I did it didn't really work for me
196:20 - because of that 1 second usually that
196:23 - has to be C for and I think it does it
196:26 - in microc seconds and you saw when I
196:28 - printed it that it didn't start from
196:30 - zero start from 500 and something and so
196:33 - it may be that at the end it didn't
196:37 - really match up to the value maybe it
196:39 - was 200 millisecond short but because
196:42 - that time time is so insignificant to
196:44 - let's say the whole 5 minutes or the 10
196:46 - minutes or the 3 minutes of the song and
196:49 - nothing May really happen but in the
196:51 - cases where we want to do exact
196:52 - comparison like compare the times and
196:55 - move on to the next song that particular
196:57 - thing is very very significant because
196:59 - the computer can process up to that
197:01 - minute
197:02 - detail so this function we call
197:07 - it songor
197:11 - finished
197:13 - and
197:17 - then we need to keep track of something
197:20 - we can say say
197:21 - status
197:24 - here and then we can say if
197:27 - status sorry if
197:30 - status equal to kill media
197:33 - player do end of media and it's just so
197:37 - so simple like that so that one qt can
197:42 - tell us that I'm done playing the song
197:43 - so that I can just say sell do next
197:48 - song so it will now trigger the next
197:51 - song which if we come to look at it
197:53 - suest that it's just we will be checking
197:55 - all these things and then playing the
197:57 - next song so you just have to make a
197:59 - connection
198:01 - here and this one would
198:07 - be S
198:11 - do
198:14 - player do media status
198:17 - changed media status change this
198:22 - one so when the media status is changed
198:24 - we want to connect it
198:29 - to s. song finished you remember that we
198:33 - created a function just few seconds ago
198:37 - finished great so this one should work
198:50 - so I'll drag it to the end and I expect
198:52 - it to play the life is a dream because
198:56 - that is the default
198:57 - next
198:59 - [Music]
199:04 - okay let see and explain life is a dream
199:10 - so but if let me just say look it and
199:15 - see
199:18 - sorry it started playing again by now
199:20 - still playing life is a dream let me
199:22 - Loop it again and
199:25 - see still playing that so let me now
199:30 - play it randomly and
199:37 - see did I click pause
199:41 - somewhere
199:43 - okay it's now
199:46 - [Music]
199:51 - playing okay now it's playing uh
199:55 - Christmas let's see now it's playing the
199:59 - raising me higher so the random also
200:01 - works and now our
200:04 - app looks more professional I forgot to
200:07 - bring anything here to control this
200:10 - particular Behavior but but if you want
200:12 - to do that you can add one button maybe
200:15 - anywhere here or maybe to this playback
200:17 - anywhere you te
200:19 - fit and then you can connect a function
200:22 - sh that if the person clicks on it or if
200:25 - that part you can make it checked like
200:27 - this that one can easily be done in here
200:29 - so you see this particular button
200:35 - here you can now come and set the
200:37 - checkable properties to true and that is
200:41 - that will do it so when you do that then
200:43 - you just run the pic5 command again you
200:45 - will have the buttom showing and then
200:48 - you can now keep track that if the
200:49 - buttom is checked like we've done for
200:51 - these ones if it is checked you can give
200:52 - a global state to keep track of that
200:54 - also so if it is checked then when the
200:57 - song gets to the end it should go to the
200:58 - next song other than that to just stop
201:00 - but it shouldn't go or like you should
201:02 - call the um song finish function
201:05 - something like that uh but I wouldn't be
201:08 - doing that for this video but I hope you
201:11 - get the idea trying to to bring up so
201:14 - now we have all these ones down here
201:16 - sorted out the only thing we have to do
201:19 - on this page is to create
201:20 - functionalities for these two buttons
201:23 - and also these two buttons and uh for
201:26 - the favorite and playlist yes we have
201:27 - not done it because we can only do it
201:29 - when we get to these places I just want
201:31 - to do it one step at a time so that we
201:33 - don't get ourselves
201:36 - confused but if you have not liked the
201:38 - video yet please be sure to smash the
201:40 - like button and share it to your friends
201:41 - who also might be
201:44 - interested
201:48 - okay so what we have to do next is the
201:53 - songs that are removing and those ones
201:55 - that should be quite easy to do let's
201:57 - come
202:05 - down on the same indent yes okay
202:10 - so
202:12 - move one
202:19 - song and then we will call it
202:22 - remove
202:25 - selected
202:31 - song for this one as always I'll try
202:35 - except block to
202:37 - remove selected song error
202:44 - and here what we want to do is current
202:48 - index now equal to sorry this one we
202:52 - need the index so s do loaded songlist
202:56 - widget
202:58 - do current R and all that we have to do
203:02 - is to get it off the list that we have
203:06 - and then from the list widget itself so
203:08 - first from the list widgets s dot
203:13 - load songlist
203:16 - widget do take item that is how we move
203:19 - an item from it and we can say current
203:24 - index and then we can now also pop it
203:26 - from the listel so that will be
203:32 - songs do current song
203:36 - list. um current index so this remove it
203:40 - for us and then we can let's work on the
203:45 - remove all songs also because it should
203:47 - be very
203:49 - similar to this one just that whenever I
203:53 - copy paste I don't know why the
203:55 - invation goes off so this one will be
203:58 - remove all songs as you have
204:02 - guessed let's make the English right so
204:05 - this we don't need the current index so
204:07 - all that we need to do is
204:10 - to clear all of them so you let me just
204:14 - type it
204:16 - have
204:18 - do loaded songlist do
204:22 - clear and then s
204:26 - dot current no songs sorry
204:30 - songs. current song
204:33 - list.
204:35 - clear but there's one very important
204:38 - thing we have to do before we clear this
204:39 - ones we have to stop the song because we
204:42 - can clear it and there will still be a
204:45 - media in the memory of the player for
204:47 - you to play so what you want to do is to
204:49 - stop the song first so s. stop
204:53 - song before because if you clear
204:56 - everything you don't have you shouldn't
204:57 - have something to play yeah okay so that
205:00 - is it also so this one we move selected
205:03 - move all songs not selected all songs
205:08 - error sorry okay
205:12 - let's see how it
205:16 - goes now we have to come up here and do
205:18 - our
205:19 - connections it's still on the default
205:21 - page so we can put it down here Reserve
205:25 - do delete something how delete selected
205:29 - BTN Yep this one let's confirm the
205:35 - name yes delete selected BTN
205:39 - dot click do
205:43 - connect want it to connect it to Ser do
205:46 - say remove one song remove selected song
205:51 - Yeah the code is growing larger
205:53 - beginning to just forget things that we
205:55 - just did a minutes ago so this one will
205:58 - be think be
206:00 - delete all songs BTM this one will be
206:05 - remove all
206:09 - songs Okay so let's just R it and
206:13 - see bringing
206:17 - a and then make a selection feeling
206:20 - happy it's gone take house Vives is gone
206:25 - and all of them are gone but this of
206:28 - course is not the way we should do it
206:30 - because what if the user was just
206:31 - testing the functionality without any
206:34 - intention of removing the song so we can
206:37 - put some checks uh maybe a popup asking
206:40 - a question if you want to delete it or
206:42 - not before we go ahead and then do that
206:46 - so that's our app will be professional
206:48 - grade as is supposed to be okay so what
206:50 - we want to do first is to check so
206:54 - if self. loaded song list
206:58 - widget do
207:01 - count is zero that means there is
207:04 - nothing in there nothing has been loaded
207:05 - app has been open fresh or something
207:07 - like that we can now say k message box
207:11 - the first time we using this thing here
207:13 - Q message box do information to show the
207:16 - user some information the first that we
207:18 - have to pass in itself and then the
207:22 - second is the title of the the window
207:24 - that should come so we can now see that
207:27 - uh
207:28 - remove
207:30 - select
207:32 - s and then the
207:34 - next is the the message that we show in
207:38 - that particular small window so now we
207:40 - can now see that uh
207:43 - playlist is
207:47 - empty okay so let's test out the remove
207:51 - one and no no no no and when after that
207:54 - then just return it's very
207:57 - necessary so let's test this one
208:02 - out so we know that uh playlist is empty
208:06 - and that is
208:09 - great but if we have some in there that
208:12 - and then this one around it should work
208:15 - take
208:16 - out okay you have guessed right this
208:19 - same thing should be inside the mo all
208:21 - songs we have to check those ones
208:24 - also so playlist is empty but this place
208:28 - we also want to just give some small
208:30 - caution to the user in the case where
208:33 - the playlist is not empty it shouldn't
208:35 - go ahead and immediately remove all the
208:37 - songs so we have to show a question to
208:40 - the user and then if the user agrees to
208:43 - that that oh it's not a mistake I was
208:45 - not testing the button or the
208:46 - functionality I'm just deleting
208:48 - everything then we go ahead and then
208:50 - delete it so that one this is how we are
208:53 - going to do
208:55 - it let's just call it question you can
208:57 - name it anything I just want to name it
209:00 - so that we the code will be readable
209:03 - question equal to Q is a same Q message
209:06 - box but this one we asking a
209:09 - question so as always and
209:13 - then the title here should
209:16 - be remove all songs disadvantage of copy
209:21 - and paste move all
209:26 - songs okay so change that one also and
209:29 - here you can
209:31 - see this
209:33 - action
209:36 - will
209:38 - remove
209:39 - all some
209:43 - from the list or something like that and
209:48 - it cannot be
209:53 - reversed uh if any anything like that
209:56 - let's just cck the back slash and or you
209:58 - can put what by English you want to put
210:00 - there and that is what I want to tell
210:02 - the
210:06 - user and here I can now
210:09 - say continue that means if you want me
210:12 - to you want me to
210:15 - continue that will be the
210:18 - question so we can come down and say
210:20 - that
210:21 - if
210:25 - question equal to equal to sorry that
210:28 - this is not JavaScript Q message box Q
210:31 - message message
210:35 - box do yes if I CH yes that is when we
210:40 - want to do these things
210:44 - other than that it will not even do
210:46 - anything so after passing these things
210:49 - there's another thing that we can pass
210:51 - which is the buttons that should appear
210:53 - on the this popup that is that is
210:56 - showing so we can say k message box do
211:01 - yes separate it with a pipe and say k
211:05 - message
211:06 - box do
211:09 - cancel and
211:12 - then if you want to add more you can add
211:14 - more let me show you so you can say Q
211:16 - message box do
211:19 - no but you bring a comma after
211:21 - everything that you want to add and then
211:23 - the default that you want to be selected
211:25 - so that in case the user presses enter
211:28 - uh what should happen because one of the
211:31 - buttons will be selected by default be
211:33 - Focus so when the user hits Enter key
211:36 - what should happen so we just want to
211:38 - save the user from removing all song so
211:41 - we can just see that now the default is
211:42 - K message box
211:45 - dot cancel as long as it's not equal to
211:47 - yes this one will not work so let us try
211:50 - out this particular one
211:55 - also and before
211:57 - then playlist is
212:03 - empty now playlist is not empty I click
212:06 - on it it says remove all songs this
212:08 - action remove all songs from reest you
212:11 - see that the default is what I was
212:13 - talking about now we have yes no and
212:15 - cancel I can click on cancel or press
212:17 - enter because it's selected by default
212:19 - but if I come here and then remove
212:22 - the the
212:25 - no I don't I don't even know the
212:27 - function of it over
212:28 - there and the low songs
212:33 - again is it that the no did not come so
212:36 - if you want to add any buttons you can
212:37 - do add
212:38 - them I forgotten all the button that are
212:41 - there but you can test it and see and
212:43 - say Q message box dot usually using pyam
212:47 - or
212:48 - any editor should give you all this
212:51 - popup see the buttons that you want
212:53 - there so
212:55 - aort set there are many buttons that you
212:58 - can just go through them and all that so
213:02 - they should
213:04 - go now it's it's okay so let's see what
213:07 - is left now here to do I don't think I
213:10 - think I think for now what we have to do
213:13 - is for this page is done except this add
213:16 - to favorites and add to playlist so now
213:20 - let's when we click this it doesn't move
213:22 - us to the playlist page it's still at
213:24 - the song list page so let's create the
213:26 - functions that will move that will help
213:29 - us navigate the different
213:32 - pages the first one will be
213:34 - switch to
213:39 - favorites and and the name will
213:42 - be the same thing so
213:45 - switch
213:54 - tobr and it's so so easy SC s do stack
213:58 - widget that is the name of the widget
213:59 - that houses all of them do
214:02 - Set current index
214:05 - Set current index
214:09 - 2B
214:11 - the favorite is the is two it uses the
214:15 - same way that python does the indexing
214:17 - so this song list that we see here uh
214:20 - the index is zero this playlist is
214:24 - index uh the playlist part is index one
214:27 - and this is two for the favorite what
214:29 - you have to pass in here is two but if
214:32 - we go ahead and this is redundant
214:35 - duplicate
214:38 - this so knowing that I have to be the
214:41 - tabing again and this's place switch
214:45 - to
214:48 - playlist switch
214:54 - to
214:56 - playlist let's just add the word tab so
214:59 - that we know that that is what we are
215:00 - doing so s
215:02 - to tab
215:07 - okay and what we want to do is
215:11 - the playlist is
215:13 - one
215:15 - okay and then the default page so that
215:19 - is you can call it the song list T so uh
215:23 - switch
215:24 - to song
215:26 - list tab release
215:30 - tab
215:31 - favorite
215:37 - tab see
215:39 - to
215:42 - let's just make this one s
215:45 - star and this index should be
215:54 - zero let hope that we've done everything
215:56 - right
215:59 - okay and then now we have to now connect
216:01 - these functions to the buttons that
216:04 - are handling them where our connections
216:07 - our connections our connections still on
216:10 - the default page which is the song list
216:12 - page that's what I mean by default page
216:14 - here this one was the name song list BTN
216:18 - list BTN and then favorite BTN so sell.
216:25 - songlist BTN do
216:28 - click.
216:30 - connect to S do switch
216:34 - to song stab this one and then we can
216:39 - duplicate this this and then
216:42 - say playlist
216:46 - BTM I'll will be switch to playlist
216:52 - Tab and then this one will be favorite
216:56 - BTN switch to
216:59 - favores no
217:02 - switch to fav tab okay so let's see if
217:07 - you can successfully
217:09 - navigate
217:11 - now if I click here I come to the
217:13 - playlist that it's rendered itting I can
217:16 - click here go to favorite and that is
217:20 - great
217:23 - okay while we have gotten to we are
217:26 - coming to interact with the database we
217:30 - will use
217:32 - the default uh SQL light database I will
217:36 - not be using so think we going to
217:39 - install the SQL workbench or post SQL
217:44 - the PG admin and those ones we use the
217:47 - SQL light and so I let us create another
217:53 - file sorry if it's becoming plenty this
217:57 - one we just call it
217:59 - DB
218:02 - functions I can spell functions right
218:05 - theb functions I'll will add it later
218:08 - Pyon and this is where all our dat
218:12 - database functions will be because all
218:13 - the things that we are left to do now is
218:15 - interactions with the
218:17 - database and I will recommend that
218:21 - you get a particular software don't
218:25 - worry if you don't understand SQL if
218:27 - used SQL before I will explain every
218:29 - step of the way and yes so please search
218:34 - for DB browser for SQL light that is a
218:38 - software I will be using to
218:41 - uh view the database because I want you
218:43 - to really understand what is going on
218:45 - and so if you count you search it you
218:48 - you see the first link should look like
218:50 - this when you click on it it should take
218:51 - you here in the downloads look for your
218:54 - operating system and then do the
218:57 - installation if you have another app
218:59 - that can view SQL light files to find
219:02 - you can use that one but this is what I
219:04 - will be using and so you can also do
219:09 - that for
219:12 - now we don't have an the database file
219:15 - here so what we want to do is no we not
219:19 - we will not create it manually it is a
219:20 - code that will create it but I'm looking
219:23 - at how we can go about it I think we
219:25 - should have aad of leaving the file in
219:27 - there let's just create a directory call
219:30 - it DBS so this is the folder where our
219:35 - database file will be so this is what we
219:37 - want to
219:38 - do we need to import OS here we also
219:43 - need to import SQL light SQL light
219:48 - 3 it comes with python you don't have to
219:51 - install anything the only thing that you
219:52 - have to install was the pt5 and the pt5
219:55 - tools and so let's just create a
220:00 - database
220:02 - directory the reason I'm doing this let
220:04 - me just finish it before I tell you why
220:06 - because that will make more
220:08 - sense PA Jo
220:11 - I want to get os. get
220:14 - CWD and I want to join it
220:16 - to DBS which is the directory we just
220:20 - created and then we can now see that app
220:24 - database is equal to os.
220:28 - path. join noce
220:32 - link join we want to join database
220:37 - directory to what to the name of the
220:40 - database which I will call
220:42 - appcore
220:44 - DP dot sorry. DP so whatever name you
220:48 - want to give it should be this and then
220:51 - this is the extension is very necessary
220:52 - make sure it's count so if you are
220:53 - calling it any different name apart from
220:55 - appdb that is fine but just make sure
220:58 - that you add the extension the DV good
221:01 - the reason why I didn't just pass this
221:04 - in as a direct path but like this is
221:07 - that if you package your application
221:10 - someone know probably something that you
221:12 - can you be willing to give to your
221:14 - friends to try out for you because
221:15 - you've done really really great because
221:17 - look at application you are building
221:20 - when the the system they are using
221:24 - defines path in a different way you may
221:27 - maybe use uh maybe
221:31 - slash DBS
221:34 - slore blah blah blah blah blah what if
221:38 - some of the parts actually use this box
221:40 - slash so if you use it hardcoded you may
221:43 - fall into trouble but if you do it this
221:45 - way the program will look at the systems
221:48 - style and then use that one for you so
221:51 - you should be safe all the
221:54 - time so the first function that we
221:57 - create
221:58 - here the comment will be create the
222:04 - database or a database
222:08 - table
222:11 - and you understand very soon and so the
222:14 - function is Define
222:17 - create
222:19 - database all
222:25 - database table shop and then it will
222:29 - only take in the table name
222:33 - here I want to restrict it to a
222:36 - string
222:38 - okay this is how we do it so you can say
222:42 - con C people usually use C and all those
222:45 - ones but I just want to make it
222:46 - connection defines the connection says
222:49 - SQL light do
222:52 - connect and then we can connect to app
222:55 - database what this one will do is that
222:57 - it will connect to it if it exists and
223:00 - if it doesn't exist it will create it so
223:02 - on the first instance when we run the
223:03 - application to create a database but for
223:06 - other ter that the database exists that
223:07 - we have not deleted it it will connect
223:10 - to it so that is why the function's name
223:11 - is create database or database table so
223:15 - I've explained the create database part
223:17 - let me explain the database table part
223:19 - and so we can say
223:21 - ker equal to connection. CER you know
223:27 - usually when you are using database uh
223:29 - like my SQL workbench or so you will be
223:32 - using your K to be clicking things
223:33 - around think of the K here that we are
223:35 - creating like that particular K you have
223:37 - to moving around and clicking buttons
223:39 - but this one you are not there to do it
223:41 - so you are employing this K guy to do it
223:43 - for you all in
223:45 - code you can also see
223:48 - K do execute so we want to execute a
223:51 - particular SQL query and for now usually
223:55 - bring three double quotes and let's see
224:01 - very soon we open the database up and
224:02 - then for now we don't have it so let me
224:04 - just type it now and I will explain so
224:07 - we can say
224:08 - create
224:11 - table if not
224:15 - exists sorry exist so to
224:19 - complete and then I will pass in the
224:21 - table name
224:23 - here sorry sorry sorry sorry table
224:28 - name as soon as I hit enter pyam added
224:31 - the F in front it should be an F string
224:33 - I forgot at first make sure it's an F
224:36 - string and then here we can want to
224:39 - create a color it look like it like an
224:41 - Excel Excel sheet so the database will
224:45 - be stored the data will be stored in
224:47 - kind of cells should I say so and then
224:49 - the column name that we want where our
224:52 - songs will be stored so the column where
224:55 - all the songs will be sted row by row we
224:57 - want to call
224:59 - it bring it open and close parenthesis
225:03 - and then I will call a song for that
225:05 - particular column and then the data type
225:08 - should be text so we python we say like
225:10 - a string this one will not be a number
225:13 - it will not be a blog or anything it's
225:15 - just a text so RW text like we are
225:18 - typing and then it is good practice that
225:22 - after we are done what you are doing we
225:23 - now have to connection do commit
225:26 - to uh commit the changes to the
225:29 - databases like saving the changes if you
225:31 - don't do that it will not save and then
225:34 - now we can say connection do close so
225:37 - that we prevent file Integrity errors
225:40 - in case the database file is being used
225:42 - by another application like you be
225:43 - seeing here okay so now that we have
225:46 - this now we have to come into our
225:48 - main.py
225:51 - file and then after globals we can do
225:56 - something
225:57 - here we can just say database stuff
226:01 - something like that appropriate name and
226:05 - then we can now say
226:08 - create data
226:11 - or
226:13 - database
226:14 - table and now you know you can pass in
226:16 - the table name
226:18 - here passing favorite and that is
226:21 - because this our favorite and let me
226:23 - import it so Pam does it for me if your
226:28 - it's not imported sure you import it and
226:30 - that is
226:32 - because uh I think I didn't explain that
226:35 - part well so when the app creates at
226:37 - first the database is fresh
226:40 - our favorite T database table should
226:43 - always be there because you be adding
226:45 - songs to favorite even if you don't want
226:47 - to add it should be there for that
226:48 - purpose and so anytime that it it runs
226:53 - the app it checks and the database is
226:55 - created it also checks if the table is
226:58 - not existing if the user has used any
227:00 - other software to delete it it should
227:02 - should bring it back because if it is
227:04 - not there to throw errors in our Cod
227:05 - when we going to run faite
227:08 - functionalities for now now I see my DBS
227:11 - has no file in there when when I run the
227:17 - application close it now there's
227:21 - something in there which is
227:23 - appdb appdb DP so let me open up the
227:27 - database the DB browser software quickly
227:29 - then we use how we see how we can use
227:31 - that one this is the DB browser um you
227:35 - are probably seeing the light team using
227:38 - the dark team just custom cized it I
227:40 - think it should be at view I did it
227:42 - somewhere maybe I've really forgotten
227:45 - where I did it butuh I think it's at
227:49 - preferences uh application style dark
227:51 - style
227:53 - yeah I like the dark team and then we
227:56 - can open a database here but let's go to
227:58 - our directory where our DBS is here I
228:01 - want to copy this file part for easy
228:05 - navigation and then click on open
228:08 - database
228:11 - paste it in go now it's
228:14 - here and you see that there's a quick
228:18 - statistics that you have one table
228:21 - called it has only one column which is
228:23 - song and that is
228:25 - great and if we come to the browse data
228:28 - tab here we can select which table we
228:30 - want to browse the data from and then we
228:33 - um use it here so for now let's let
228:37 - close connection to our database it is
228:39 - good to know that the database has been
228:41 - created and then there's the table in
228:44 - there so what we want to do now is to
228:49 - we create the function to add a
228:51 - particular song to song to favorite so
228:53 - that we see how it appears in our
228:55 - database also but before we do that
228:59 - inside our DB functions we have to
229:02 - create function that will handle that so
229:05 - that should
229:08 - be
229:19 - okay so add
229:25 - song to
229:28 - database
229:38 - table
229:40 - I didn't correct this database
229:43 - table
229:44 - here you taking the
229:47 - song which is a
229:49 - string we also take in the particular
229:53 - table which is a
229:55 - string by the app database app data no
230:00 - no no no no the database sorry the
230:05 - database keep on forgetting the a the
230:07 - database should Beal to the app dat
230:12 - base okay and these things will be very
230:16 - very close to each other so permit me to
230:19 - copy comfortably place paste it here
230:22 - this is this part that we change so
230:25 - there a cute we can just get rid of
230:30 - this and then what we want to do here is
230:33 - say insert
230:35 - into and this is uh this is a the SQL
230:40 - the language to interact with the
230:42 - database so is just very close to
230:44 - English more simpler than python itself
230:46 - so insert into and then what you want to
230:48 - set the table name you give it here of
230:51 - course it should be lower case we insert
230:53 - into
230:54 - table oh I was expecting the to complete
230:57 - to do it for me let going do it myself
231:00 - insert into table and then what we want
231:03 - to insert into the table after this one
231:05 - we just say
231:07 - value course there can be multiple in
231:10 - insertions but this is a singular one we
231:13 - want to insert and then we bring this
231:15 - open and close parenthesis and put a
231:17 - question mark
231:18 - inside and let me explain it if our file
231:23 - or our database had maybe three columns
231:26 - we put
231:27 - one
231:29 - two and maybe three separated by comment
231:33 - you get what I'm trying to me we would
231:34 - have been putting them
231:36 - there but because this is just a single
231:38 - column call some you just be inserting
231:42 - one and this is of course also the thing
231:45 - we are
231:47 - inserting but after this string we have
231:50 - to put a comma here and tell the
231:54 - database what is it that we are
231:57 - inserting we are now we've told you that
231:59 - this is the data that is coming but to
232:01 - which particular column or sorry this is
232:05 - the table that
232:07 - should that's the T table if I should
232:11 - come in simple terms this is the target
232:13 - table but what is the data that is
232:14 - coming the data is the S but you have to
232:18 - put it in a tle here as a
232:20 - song for the Caps
232:23 - song but don't forget to bring a comma
232:28 - afterwards so that's the
232:31 - SQL this is the parameter so SQL the
232:34 - code that the database will understand
232:36 - and this is the parameter that is going
232:37 - in be careful to bring bring this comma
232:39 - other than that you get a lot of
232:44 - Errors it is a single file but you still
232:46 - have to treat it like multiple or
232:47 - something like that so that should do
232:49 - for us you commit you close
232:54 - y back inside our
232:57 - main down
233:01 - here let me just
233:04 - say um
233:07 - favorate
233:15 - functions and this one will
233:19 - be add song to
233:24 - favorite
233:26 - okay that always wants to format my code
233:29 - for me I don't know why I like to click
233:30 - on it all the time and so we can just
233:33 - call it add song to favorite so
233:37 - DF add song
233:40 - to The
233:42 - Great and
233:48 - here you have to get a particular song
233:50 - so the current
233:55 - index so add the song to cover it we get
234:01 - a current index so sell. loaded songlist
234:05 - widget. current row
234:11 - and then you say if current index is n
234:14 - you can be adding things that you have
234:16 - not clicked on if current index is
234:20 - none that means the user have not
234:22 - checked anything but it's just click on
234:25 - out
234:26 - bre then course you can right click on
234:29 - some place where there is no song and
234:31 - then the person use out so we want to
234:34 - prevent that so K messagebox do
234:37 - information
234:39 - you can make it a warning too but I
234:41 - don't think I would use the warning
234:43 - yourself and then here we can say the
234:46 - title will
234:47 - be add songs
235:01 - toes and then we can
235:03 - say
235:05 - select song to add
235:13 - to you should select the
235:15 - song and then as usual we return so that
235:18 - we break out of this particular
235:22 - operation okay but if that is not the
235:25 - case then we want to try and then here
235:28 - we can
235:29 - say adding
235:32 - song to
235:35 - favorite
235:37 - error
235:40 - okay here we can just say that the
235:44 - particular song we have gotten the index
235:46 - already song equal to
235:49 - songs so songs dot current song listet
235:55 - and that particular index get out that
235:58 - particular song at that index and then
236:01 - here you can say add we call it abon to
236:07 - database
236:09 - table I think so you can see here that
236:13 - s equal
236:15 - to import it for
236:19 - me be sure to import that one so you can
236:21 - see the S equal
236:26 - to let's be
236:28 - safe and pass it here as S and F string
236:32 - and then we can say table should be
236:35 - equal
236:37 - to
236:42 - faites yes so this should do usually if
236:46 - it is sucessful you may want to show
236:48 - some info
236:52 - here
236:54 - information
237:02 - maybe let's convert this to an F
237:04 - string and say. paath do this
237:09 - name
237:12 - song Oh what is
237:15 - this was
237:19 - successfully
237:21 - added two favorates
237:26 - so that we know that operation was
237:29 - successful
237:32 - um this is not a button that should be
237:34 - handling this request this is not a
237:37 - button this button will be handling the
237:39 - request of adding the particular playing
237:41 - song to favorite but for now that we
237:43 - don't have the context or the popup menu
237:45 - to select the one that we will actually
237:48 - use the action let us use that button
237:50 - for now
237:53 - so now we will come away
237:57 - from uh the favorite let just keep it
238:02 - favorite so that you know that you're
238:03 - keeping track of you're looking for
238:06 - something you just find it easily so
238:07 - sell do even though it's at a default
238:10 - page
238:12 - um okay let me put at a default
238:15 - page but the button here after this one
238:20 - so
238:21 - s do the
238:29 - name add to five BTN do
238:37 - click do connect we want to connect it
238:41 - to self. add
238:44 - song to
238:46 - favorite yep so let's just test it out
238:50 - and see and we can verify whether it was
238:52 - added by viewing it from our theb
238:56 - browser
238:59 - app a very happy Christmas app to
239:02 - favorite a very happy Christmas was
239:04 - successfully added to favorite we will
239:07 - confirm it
239:09 - um maybe you like it that way but
239:11 - seriously I don't like it this
239:14 - way that's every time I have to favorite
239:17 - this particular thing should pop up so I
239:19 - just show you that it can be done I'll
239:20 - comment it in case you need it from the
239:22 - code to be on GitHub but I don't like it
239:24 - that way so let's
239:27 - me load more songs just want to add
239:30 - plenty things so that you can see have
239:32 - to
239:33 - favorite I to favorite I to favorite I
239:37 - to favorite more multiple times at for
239:41 - okay now let's come
239:44 - back open database take that back
239:48 - intelligence come to this browse data
239:51 - side and voila you see that all these
239:54 - ones are there let me show it so is
239:58 - there they have been added I
239:59 - intentionally added the feeling happy
240:01 - multiple times so now that we know that
240:04 - we can add to our
240:06 - favorite what we can do is to now load
240:11 - songs from our database to our fa St
240:16 - okay so let's see how we load those ones
240:19 - usually it's advisable to close the
240:21 - database especially when you're going to
240:22 - use it elsewhere we don't want any file
240:25 - Integrity
240:27 - errors in case any modifications has to
240:30 - occur it will not allow us so that's one
240:34 - to we have to come to the B functions
240:36 - and then the function to get all the
240:38 - songs from a
240:41 - particular database
240:50 - table or we should just go ahead and
240:53 - then write all the the B functions I'll
240:54 - will be explaining them and then we will
240:57 - not just be switching between files that
240:59 - will save us a lot I think so yeah so
241:02 - now we can add toate create database
241:05 - this
241:06 - on Okay so the next one that we want to
241:10 - do is so the one is uh want to delete
241:14 - song from a database table so we want to
241:16 - delete a particular song that one I'll
241:18 - hold on to it for now because I want to
241:20 - show you some SQL trick the problem and
241:24 - a
241:25 - solution and so we can go ahead and
241:27 - delete all songs rather
241:30 - first
241:33 - delete all songs
241:37 - from
241:38 - uh
241:39 - database
241:41 - table
241:43 - okay the same Bo St so permit me to copy
241:49 - and comfortably paste it here so
241:52 - Define
241:56 - delete
241:57 - [Music]
241:59 - all songs
242:03 - from
242:05 - database table or something like that
242:09 - and this one to we need a
242:13 - table which is a
242:15 - string and then the
242:18 - database which will equal to app
242:22 - database and so I me paste what I copied
242:25 - connection is the same but
242:28 - here we can we just have to say delete
242:32 - from we don't need we don't need this
242:35 - so say delete
242:39 - from and then the table name
242:43 - comes that is all we have no parameters
242:47 - to
242:48 - pass
242:51 - okay okay and this is this will delete
242:54 - all songs from the database table for us
242:57 - the next that we are working on is to
242:58 - fetch all songs from a particular
243:00 - database table
243:02 - so since they are almost all the same
243:05 - let me just
243:07 - duplicate
243:13 - fetch all songs from a database
243:26 - table and we will still need the table
243:30 - and then the database and we
243:33 - will this one will now be select
243:39 - and the column name should come so
243:40 - select the column name excuse me should
243:43 - be Su from then the table name but how
243:47 - this will come is it will bring it as a
243:51 - tuple of Tes so this is how it will
243:58 - come a list a big list sorry of T orle
244:02 - of tle something like that but in any
244:04 - case looks like this so item
244:09 - and I think it's the
244:11 - index or the
244:14 - rule or some kind of ID but that is this
244:18 - is how it brings them and for us but I
244:21 - forgotten the second second thing here
244:23 - but this is the item that we are looking
244:25 - for then the ID or some index or rule
244:28 - will follow so we have to Now find a way
244:30 - of getting only the items into a
244:32 - particular list and we use a list
244:34 - comprehension for that so we can say
244:36 - that
244:39 - now um
244:41 - songs should equal to or let me say song
244:45 - data
244:48 - so data should be equal to k. fetch all
244:54 - all of them for us and then now you can
244:56 - say data equal
245:00 - to confer so
245:04 - S zero
245:06 - sorry
245:12 - one of them is missing for song in song
245:23 - data so as I show you the structure that
245:25 - will F the first item for every item in
245:28 - the song data and then we can nowain
245:31 - this data after closing the connection
245:33 - so return data so that will come in as a
245:37 - a single python list and that shouldn't
245:40 - be a problem to work with now we can
245:43 - there's a place where we also
245:46 - get all the tables in a particular
245:49 - database especially when we are creating
245:51 - a new playlist We I don't want have to
245:54 - really come back to this file again so
245:56 - let's get that function also
245:58 - done
246:00 - and that will
246:05 - be get all table
246:08 - in the
246:11 - database and will
246:14 - Define get um
246:18 - playlist tables because we only use it
246:20 - for the playlist so we can just name it
246:22 - like that and this one not even taking
246:24 - anything and if you are actually giving
246:27 - this app database I don't think this
246:29 - particular database
246:31 - necessary yeah plus it's just
246:36 - redundant we are not using it for
246:42 - anything yes we don't need a
246:45 - database in you can call use that
246:48 - particular parameter inside but it will
246:49 - still be redundant
246:51 - so because it's just this file it's no
246:53 - to get it from but the usual things will
246:56 - go on so our
246:58 - connection will still be equal to SQL
247:02 - three and then do
247:05 - connect we connect the app database
247:09 - and then
247:11 - here
247:13 - also go to
247:19 - connection there's the execution that
247:22 - will be a little different so k.
247:24 - execute and in here this is how we write
247:28 - it this one we not fing from a
247:30 - particular table or anything like that
247:33 - in fact you should appreciate it more if
247:36 - I do some of these things in the DB
247:39 - browser now let's open the
247:44 - database and there's a place where you
247:47 - can bring a query Builder or something
247:50 - like execute SQL
247:54 - here so if I
247:56 - say select sorry select I just hope you
248:00 - see it clearly
248:02 - select
248:04 - star that means everything from um
248:10 - favorit and I think control enter should
248:12 - execute it for
248:14 - me of course because this place is this
248:17 - particular software you you may not
248:19 - really see the tup in T post stuff I was
248:22 - talking about but if you f it in Pyon R
248:24 - like that that is what you
248:27 - see so we see all the things here
248:32 - retained but what if you want the tables
248:35 - so that's one the synx is uh a bit
248:38 - different from this we just have to say
248:43 - select
248:44 - select star the same star that mean want
248:47 - to get everything but from
248:51 - SQ L
248:54 - LightCore
248:55 - master and then we can now say
248:59 - where
249:02 - type equal
249:06 - to
249:08 - table so if the type is
249:13 - table then get it for us so let's
249:17 - see then now you see that it gave
249:20 - us the favorite if we create any daming
249:24 - table inside there it will come back to
249:26 - live let's just try and see the database
249:29 - structure tables can we create a new
249:31 - table from
249:36 - here
249:40 - let's create table yes so let just call
249:43 - it
249:44 - dummy and then the field are the field
249:49 - let's call it name and that is all so
249:53 - okay now we have two tables in there we
249:55 - have not written the changes to our
249:56 - database so nothing will happen at the
249:59 - front end for python but if we come back
250:02 - to our SQL and now execute it again that
250:06 - now we have two things return
250:08 - so this name is what we be targeting and
250:12 - then using in our program so let me
250:15 - rever
250:17 - changes yes so now when I come back I
250:19 - shouldn't see that particular table
250:21 - again and then so that is the syntax
250:24 - that will get
250:26 - us can copy
250:29 - it and then come back to
250:32 - Pyon where is it that we are getting
250:34 - just paste it in here safely and this
250:37 - will get get us all the table
250:40 - so you saw how it came so we have to now
250:44 - work around so tables equal to you saw
250:47 - that it came as
250:49 - a this one will turn if we are fing it R
250:52 - like that in Python to return like a tle
250:54 - of two each of these 1 2 3 four five 1 2
250:58 - 3 four or five one two three four five
251:03 - each of them will come in so a twole of
251:05 - two PES each twole represents a rule and
251:07 - each row has five elements in it and all
251:09 - that but we now also have to get
251:14 - it by a l comprehension so we can see
251:18 - table underscore name and you see that
251:22 - one was the second object so the second
251:24 - one so we can get it by the first index
251:27 - that's the name can get it by the first
251:29 - index so table name the first
251:33 - one uh for table name
251:37 - table name in tables so that will also
251:43 - give us just that
251:45 - particular oh I didn't get
251:52 - so okay let me just go table names
251:56 - should equal to
251:58 - kza fetch all and then this one should
252:01 - be
252:02 - table names great so this one will just
252:06 - give us a list of all the tables and it
252:08 - will be easier for us to work with in
252:10 - Python but you can actually see that
252:13 - this is a very dangerous uh potentially
252:17 - dangerous code so what you want to do is
252:19 - to wrap it in a tricept block so let me
252:22 - just paste this one in here so
252:25 - error
252:27 - getting table
252:34 - names but this exception will not be
252:37 - broad exception like this we can
252:39 - actually Target it like SQL
252:43 - light do arrrow so if there's any error
252:47 - you should just let us know error fing
252:49 - table and this one will have a
252:56 - finally and finally is that connection
253:00 - do close so whatever happens just close
253:02 - the connection for us
253:06 - okay
253:07 - but if it is successful then we have to
253:09 - return tables so
253:11 - return
253:13 - tables so that we can use it great and
253:17 - the next one that we want to do is
253:21 - to delete from a database table so no
253:26 - delete the table itself so
253:29 - delete uh database table that will come
253:34 - in handy when we want to delete a
253:35 - particular playlist because a playlist
253:37 - will each be a table in the
253:39 - database and this one we can
253:43 - borrow from here or something like that
253:47 - so Define
253:51 - delete
253:55 - database
253:57 - table and we need a table of
254:00 - course which should be a
254:06 - string
254:14 - and this place will be drop table and
254:18 - then the table name so drop table that
254:23 - is how we delete a table just drop table
254:24 - and then the table name follows that is
254:27 - it so we don't need all of
254:30 - this and that should do it for us and I
254:34 - wanted to show you uh s the delete one
254:38 - we didn't work on that one is
254:40 - it if we did if I should duplicate
254:48 - this no some gets confused between the
254:52 - py cham shortcut and the vs shortcut and
254:55 - so this is the delete all so
254:57 - delete uh how do we call it delete
255:04 - song delete song from from database
255:08 - table everything Remains the Same until
255:11 - this execute
255:14 - part I'll show you
255:20 - why now let's come back
255:23 - here uh hope we have not closed it yes
255:25 - we have not closed
255:27 - it we have to delete by the item name so
255:30 - let's also select uh everything
255:36 - from
255:37 - uh
255:39 - favorite and then let's run it see that
255:42 - we we get them here like this so is
255:46 - that's why I added a feeling happy
255:48 - multiple times is what I'm about to show
255:49 - you if I click this and then copy it
255:56 - here and I
256:00 - say delete from favorite sorry favorite
256:07 - and then I can
256:09 - say
256:11 - where um
256:13 - song equal
256:15 - to then I paste this one
256:19 - in that's if I write the syntax like
256:22 - this I want I'm telling the database to
256:26 - delete a particular song from this table
256:29 - where the song is this you have that's
256:31 - what you have to pass in because you're
256:33 - not keeping track of it by IDs that will
256:36 - be uh uh a little bit difficult but if
256:39 - if you want to do that you can do that
256:40 - you understand the database language but
256:42 - I just want to show this one also so if
256:45 - I run this query
256:47 - now and then let's say afterwards you
256:49 - want to select everything from faite so
256:53 - select star from
256:56 - favorite okay so let me select this
257:02 - line and then control enter it has been
257:05 - executed successfully
257:08 - and now let's run this one
257:13 - also can you see just what just happened
257:15 - it removed every instance of that
257:18 - particular uh item from the database so
257:22 - even if we right click on an index in
257:25 - our favorite list widgets that we want
257:27 - to remove as long as that particular
257:31 - index uh we will fetch the particular
257:33 - song from the song list if if there are
257:37 - five of them in there it will delete
257:39 - everything it will not use that because
257:41 - we use the song name not the index so
257:43 - that's we pass the song name in here and
257:44 - how we get it is that we get an index
257:46 - that has been clicked on in the favorite
257:48 - list withit and use it to fetch the
257:51 - particular song from the list and then
257:53 - use the list the value we get to delete
257:55 - it like we have passed in manually here
257:58 - but how do we go about it if we want to
258:01 - add a song multiple times to VI because
258:03 - may you just want the song to be playing
258:04 - for 100 times or number of times and we
258:08 - can work around that one so let me
258:10 - revert all the changes yes and then you
258:14 - will see that we have
258:16 - our feeling happy here is that there are
258:20 - total of 12 rows now so feeling happy
258:23 - comes
258:24 - in let me show you how we can
258:28 - delete without causing this particular
258:31 - trouble so delete from
258:34 - favorate uh the song is what we will C
258:36 - for now delete from favorite oh am I not
258:41 - coming
258:42 - back in this place we can see
258:45 - where row
258:48 - ID equal
258:50 - to we can open and close parenthesis
258:53 - here and then we can now say
258:57 - select the
259:00 - minimum of row ID this row
259:04 - ID sorry row ID comes in default because
259:09 - the database tracks keeps track of all
259:11 - the items placing by their IDs it gives
259:13 - it to them even though it may not really
259:15 - show it here but it does give it to them
259:18 - this is you can think of the RO IDs as
259:20 - these ones are the uh left hand side
259:24 - here and now we can now see
259:27 - from
259:31 - favorites and then see where song equal
259:33 - to okay I think I should be bringing
259:35 - things down to the next like so where
259:40 - row
259:43 - ID equal to
259:46 - this
259:48 - favor or song equal to
259:53 - this
259:55 - where s equal to
260:00 - this so let me try and explain again so
260:02 - we are deleting from favorite square
260:05 - instead of passing the song
260:07 - directly we want to get all the r IDs
260:12 - they will all be returned so to for the
260:14 - feeling happy that particular object
260:17 - will have the r IDs from 4 to
260:21 - 11 and so it will get all of them for us
260:24 - so we want to select the minimum from it
260:26 - you can actually select the maximum here
260:28 - also or something like that it it will
260:31 - also work but in all cases we are
260:33 - targeting to select only one value from
260:35 - it so if it should take the minimum to
260:38 - take the
260:39 - four from that particular favorites and
260:44 - then it will delete that one so it uses
260:47 - this to check how many rows have this oh
260:52 - I got five rows okay starting from where
260:55 - starting from index 4 to index 11 or
260:57 - index 4 to something and then okay then
261:00 - pick the minimum row ID what is it and
261:02 - it is four okay then delete the item at
261:04 - four so hopefully if did this thing very
261:07 - very right if I select this me terminate
261:10 - it with a semicolon and I run
261:14 - it okay execution finished with errors
261:16 - that means we have some errors in our
261:18 - code delete from favorite where row ID
261:22 - equal to
261:24 - select minimum row ID and this one was
261:29 - not supposed to be
261:31 - there
261:33 - apologies because it's not even closing
261:35 - anywhere so when we execute this it's
261:39 - still getting us some error so where row
261:47 - ID okay okay okay okay okay that one
261:50 - should be here but they should be
261:52 - another one that closes it here
261:55 - too yeah there should be another one
261:57 - that closes it here too so uh I think
262:01 - that in this case it really makes more
262:03 - sense so delete from row ID
262:05 - where
262:07 - and then which of the row IDs do you
262:09 - want to delete so row ID equal to and
262:12 - then all these things will will be
262:15 - executed so get this particular value
262:18 - all the row IDs for the value and select
262:20 - the minimum from it so now I think all
262:22 - the errors have been fixed forgive me
262:24 - for the errors and now we have execution
262:26 - finished without errors you remember the
262:29 - were 12 now let's run it
262:32 - again they 11 now if I rever
262:35 - changes
262:37 - yes and select everything from favorite
262:40 - we get 12 but if
262:43 - I run
262:45 - this
262:47 - select now we have 11 so now we've
262:50 - working around when there are multiple
262:52 - songs in the playlist in the favorite
262:54 - and the person just wants to delete one
262:56 - of them so let's just copy this and
263:00 - comfortably paste it
263:05 - here
263:09 - I think we can format it well
263:13 - here okay but this one will not be
263:18 - this it will
263:21 - be are we
263:25 - table without a song Impossible so
263:29 - song but the song will also be a
263:34 - string okay so delete
263:38 - from this is where the table comes in
263:41 - and then here we also pass in the song
263:45 - that looks good to me and I think that
263:47 - is all that we have to do here if any of
263:50 - them is Left Behind we come and do it
263:52 - but I think that is all so now let's
263:55 - work on the functionality to
263:58 - delete a database delete song from
264:02 - favorite if we have to do that then we
264:04 - have to Now work on the
264:09 - the popup menus or the context menus but
264:11 - for now let's just make sure that
264:13 - whatever we have our favorite can be
264:15 - loaded into our application so before
264:17 - the asong to
264:21 - favorite we can say
264:24 - load um
264:26 - favorite
264:27 - songs and then the function will
264:31 - be load uncore
264:35 - favorite
264:42 - into
264:45 - app
264:49 - okay and then favorite songs so we can
264:53 - say
264:56 - favorite songs will be equal to remember
265:00 - we created a function that says fetch
265:01 - all songs from database table that is
265:03 - what you be using so fetch and that's SC
265:06 - all
265:07 - songs from
265:10 - database
265:12 - table and then we pass in the table name
265:16 - which is
265:19 - favorite so be sure to import this fet
265:24 - all
265:26 - song This know how you name it from
265:30 - database I didn't bring the a s from
265:33 - database table P I'm quick quick quick
265:36 - quick
265:37 - quick okay has imported it for me so now
265:40 - this will give us all the
265:42 - songs and then we can now
265:45 - say songs do favorit song list
265:50 - wiet do clear because we be appending
265:54 - and why we are clearing it is that
265:56 - anytime we remove a song from the
265:58 - favorite we have to now load the
265:59 - favorite again back into the application
266:02 - so if there's already an existing uh
266:04 - list inside the list a favorite list
266:08 - wiget it it will not affect it the
266:10 - database will not affect it so what we
266:13 - have to do is that we have to now clear
266:15 - it and then add a new one that the
266:17 - changes will will be affected at the the
266:21 - user side that is why we are clearing it
266:24 - before or if I comment it out I think
266:27 - the effect will explain it better and
266:29 - then here we can say
266:32 - self do favorite list wages do clear
266:36 - list widget also do clear but we will
266:41 - comment that one to out for now and then
266:44 - we can now say what I want you to
266:46 - understand it well so
266:50 - for
266:54 - favorite in favorite
266:57 - songs we want to append it to the
266:59 - favorite song list reg inside song so
267:01 - that we can play from favorite if we
267:03 - want to so songs do favorites.
267:08 - append
267:10 - favorite and we also want to append it
267:13 - the list widget so self. favorite
267:17 - songlist widget. add
267:21 - item add item we want to add a favorite
267:25 - also so until we connect it or call it
267:29 - at the top
267:30 - there and we go to favorite we not see
267:33 - anything even though we have stuff in
267:35 - our database
267:36 - empty but what we have to do is to come
267:39 - up here when we have the database stuff
267:41 - is it and then we can
267:45 - call ser. load favorite into
267:49 - app that should fix it now you come to
267:52 - favorite see all our songs and
267:55 - immediately you know what is wrong so
267:57 - let's go down and fix
268:00 - it first is
268:04 - to
268:08 - where is it
268:10 - here so it should be where do
268:14 - path do base name of
268:18 - favorite and that should fix
268:22 - it and then they are all here we can
268:25 - scroll up and down also and yes that is
268:29 - it but you can see also from the
268:30 - finished version that there was some
268:33 - favorite icon here and you know how we
268:35 - did it for the song list widget
268:37 - so let's
268:39 - just bring this one
268:45 - down okay you know that you have to add
268:47 - it to a k list widget item which will
268:52 - take the Q
268:56 - icon and then we can go to our QT
269:01 - designer and copy the PA but for now let
269:03 - me bring this okay I think I forgot the
269:07 - shortcut let me just copy and paste it
269:12 - there okay so let's go back look for the
269:17 - icon it's this one copy
269:21 - path and
269:23 - then paste it
269:26 - in so this should
269:28 - work let's
269:33 - see and then everything is now beautiful
269:36 - like that
269:38 - sweet
269:41 - okay oh okay there's a there's a Buton
269:43 - here to delete the favorite so let's
269:45 - just work on functionality to delete
269:47 - samung from favorite and I you
269:50 - understand why we how to bring these
269:53 - things here
269:56 - so add song to
270:00 - favorite I think this should be very
270:03 - similar to the delete song from for I
270:06 - remove some
270:09 - favorite but I will not copy and
270:13 - paste so think we have one indentation
270:17 - in and then we can now
270:21 - say uh remove song from
270:34 - favorites
270:48 - okay you remember we had to perform some
270:50 - check to when we were deleting the items
270:55 - from so we have to perform this check
270:58 - again so that if it is empty don't just
271:02 - be woring the database with connection
271:07 - without any work so if this one will be
271:13 - favorite if it is empty say
271:18 - remove song
271:21 - from sorry
271:23 - [Music]
271:25 - favores and then we can
271:28 - say
271:32 - favorite
271:33 - favores list is empty then will return
271:37 - other than
271:39 - that we want to get the current index
271:42 - also so the current
271:46 - index which should be equal to self.
271:49 - favorite list widget do
271:53 - current
271:54 - row and then we can say if current index
272:00 - is
272:03 - none then the person has not selected
272:05 - you need something like that so we can
272:07 - just show a q message box
272:24 - here once again I'm sorry for the
272:27 - background noise occasional background
272:28 - noise some work is going on and remove
272:33 - some from this place will be
272:41 - select a song to
272:44 - remove from
272:47 - favorite okay the return okay we can
272:51 - keep it
272:52 - there other than that you want to do try
272:55 - it's a necessary
272:57 - thing so removing
273:00 - from
273:03 - favorite error and here we can now say
273:09 - song the song that we want to move down
273:11 - we have the current index at the top
273:13 - there so song equal to songs do favorite
273:17 - list wig remember we be playing these
273:19 - ones from the favorite song list wiget
273:21 - so you have to remove it from using that
273:22 - particular list and then we want to get
273:25 - the current
273:28 - index we have a function here called
273:31 - delete some from database table what is
273:33 - it yeah
273:37 - so that is what we use here just call it
273:42 - and then make sure I import
273:45 - it and then here the
273:48 - song will
273:53 - be
273:55 - song and then the
274:04 - table
274:12 - okay and because we want the the thing
274:14 - to refresh on the application we just
274:17 - have to call the S do load for into
274:22 - app

275:48 - why the try and accept is necessary it's
275:50 - a databas is lock and that is because

281:54 - there's nothing in
281:57 - there this card what changes did we even
282:00 - do to it so now let's add a few songs to
282:03 - favorite

282:10 - favorite song l so feeling happy want to
282:14 - Christmas once life is a dream Once

282:20 - and you go there and they didn't do that
282:23 - in real time for us why was
282:28 - so should be doing it in real time but
282:31 - was it added they were added why was not
282:34 - doing in real
282:38 - time it should come from the this
282:40 - function the we
282:42 - call oh no we didn't call it so that
282:45 - means after this place we should call S
282:49 - do load Fates into app so that we see
282:53 - the real time changes
282:57 - okay so favorite okay let me load a song
283:03 - here uh and see life is a dream I come
283:07 - to favor and I add life is a dream to
283:10 - favorite I that it comes in here real
283:11 - time and that is what we are looking for
283:13 - so now let's work on functionalities to
283:15 - get these ones to
283:17 - play we will now modify the play
283:22 - function where is
283:29 - it we should be Clos
283:32 - yes and here
283:35 - let's be save let's declare
283:38 - Global
283:43 - stop and say
283:47 - that stop this force it cannot be
283:49 - stopped
283:54 - stop made a mistake here
283:59 - stop equal to false
284:03 - okay
284:05 - because it should be
284:08 - playing and here we only have to check
284:10 - which of the widgets are we are on and
284:13 - then we we know what we are we are doing
284:16 - so if we on the favorite uh list wiget
284:22 - then it will
284:24 - be that one that we use for the
284:27 - selection and then the index into the
284:30 - particular list but if we are not on the
284:33 - other side then so it's only this part
284:35 - that we have to cut for now and then say
284:38 - that if self. stack
284:42 - widget dot current
284:46 - index am I writing something wrong here
284:48 - current index um let's work first with
284:51 - the song the song list with so that one
284:54 - is the first one so and then we know
284:57 - that this is how we supposed to
284:59 - go okay we can now say a leave
285:05 - self
285:06 - dot stack
285:08 - widget
285:10 - and do current
285:14 - index equal to the playl is one the
285:17 - favorite is two so it should be
285:19 - two then let's just paste it and do some
285:23 - modification then the current selection
285:25 - is not this it is the
285:30 - favorite songes current row and then
285:35 - here we be indexing to favorite song
285:37 - list also not that one so this one
285:40 - should fix it for the play for us let's
285:42 - see if we can play from our favorite
285:46 - directly so let me just pick a very
285:49 - happy Christmas because it's close to
285:54 - [Music]
285:55 - Christmas and you can see that it's
285:58 - actually playing the song and yes you
286:01 - can now play my but because you have not
286:03 - configured it for the best and previous
286:05 - I don't think that be a good thing for
286:07 - us tode here Al make crash
286:10 - so let me pause play this
286:15 - one okay so now we can play from that
286:18 - one let's work on the nest for
286:22 - the list also this function should be
286:26 - close Okay so for this one
286:33 - also
286:37 - we need to copy it up to where the URL
286:40 - is this
286:42 - one and then if
286:45 - self do stack
286:48 - widget do current index is zero sorry
286:54 - not o zero then we paste it because
286:57 - that's what is happening the default one
287:02 - a
287:03 - if
287:11 - so dot stack widget. current index equal
287:18 - to
287:20 - two and let's paste it it should be
287:22 - similar but with some small changes the
287:25 - current media is still the same the
287:26 - current song Ur is still the
287:30 - same and then the current song index
287:34 - will change this one will go to
287:37 - favorites
287:40 - and yes the next song index will be the
287:48 - same but this is
287:52 - favorite
287:54 - yes this should
287:57 - work let's
288:03 - see
288:05 - so let me play
288:10 - Christmas
288:13 - [Music]
288:15 - next uh is playing life is a dream but
288:18 - it's not moving
288:21 - the this is Str it is plain it correctly
288:25 - but
288:26 - [Music]
288:28 - working oh and that is because it is
288:31 - your favorite song list wiet favorite
288:34 - or something like that yeah shouldn't be
288:36 - the actual songet yes and so this one
288:39 - should work
288:46 - now yep and now the changes are being
288:49 - effed fantastic but there's one more
288:52 - thing uh you realize that when we're
288:54 - playing from the default this place so
288:56 - now we be playing a lot from our
288:58 - favorites and I go next next next next
289:01 - next you see how it's ROM
289:04 - randomly chooses we want to be able to
289:08 - move to the first index when we hit the
289:10 - last one so we have to just modify this
289:13 - code a bit just a little
289:16 - bit uh do we have to modify the shold
289:20 - nest also yeah I think we
289:23 - do so let's just work on the shuffled
289:27 - Nest this Loop n will not be
289:31 - affected so for the shuffled nest
289:34 - also up to where we get a song
289:39 - URL we can cut it up here and say that
289:42 - if uh self. stack
289:46 - widget do
289:49 - current current index equal to zero
289:53 - should be like we did
289:55 - before and if that is not the case we
290:00 - leave self. stack widget
290:04 - do current index equal to
290:09 - two then let's paste it and have the
290:13 - modifications okay okay okay okay I've
290:16 - realized an error in the first one that
290:18 - we did let's do let me correct it here
290:21 - then we I'll show you why you remember
290:25 - if we set the what is
290:28 - it see this one we are setting it here
290:31 - we are setting the current rule here but
290:33 - what if we are playing from the
290:37 - um the loadest song list widgets that
290:41 - means we not be able to set that one to
290:42 - let me show you exactly what I'm saying
290:44 - because I'm setting it down here now if
290:46 - I load a song
290:50 - here I'm very sorry once again for this
290:53 - background noise you see I'm going next
290:56 - but is not changing that's because I'm
290:57 - setting it afterwards so let me fix it
291:00 - here then we will come back and do it so
291:02 - so now after this place
291:06 - I can say self we just set that one
291:10 - inside here when it is the song list
291:12 - wiget but if it's the
291:14 - favorite set the favorite list
291:18 - wiget but I don't think we have to do
291:20 - any modifications to this particular
291:21 - file at this time so all we have to do
291:24 - is to come back here and fix our
291:29 - error so after this we can paste it in
291:34 - and then we can get
291:37 - this cut it from
291:39 - here and then paste it in
291:42 - here great so this should fix that
291:45 - particular error for us and
291:49 - also
291:51 - we want to work on the when it gets to
291:55 - the end of the queue what it should do
291:57 - nextest so for the shaffle nest we don't
292:01 - have a problem with this so that one is
292:02 - only the default nest
292:04 - that we be working on in that regard so
292:07 - let me
292:09 - see where is
292:13 - it so we get
292:16 - the song
292:19 - index we get the next
292:27 - index okay before we just add one to it
292:30 - let's
292:32 - see we have to check we can say
292:36 - if s
292:41 - index +
292:44 - 1 is equal to the
292:47 - length of song dot I think it's current
292:52 - song list widget current song list
292:55 - forgive me then next
292:59 - index nextore index equal to Z
293:07 - else next index next index plus song
293:11 - index plus one so this one checks so if
293:15 - the index you you know that the index
293:17 - starts from zero but the length if I
293:20 - have a list of five items and I I I ask
293:23 - python for the length it will tell me
293:24 - five but if I ask it for the index of
293:29 - the last element in that five member
293:31 - list it will tell me four so that is
293:33 - what why I have to add one to you so
293:35 - that it can work that way so if it gets
293:38 - to the number four to actually know that
293:39 - it's at the end index four which is item
293:42 - five and that will render five here and
293:44 - this check will render valid so if
293:47 - that's the case then next index should
293:48 - be zero then use it here if not
293:52 - then just have
293:55 - to increase it and I think we can do the
293:58 - same thing
294:01 - here rep place it with this one
294:06 - yes so by this one will be favorite
294:09 - don't
294:10 - forget sweet and so let's you remember
294:14 - that the previous also has it where it's
294:16 - previous where is previous previous
294:18 - previous okay so previous two has it
294:21 - let's just paste this one
294:24 - here by the previous we have not
294:26 - actually worked on
294:29 - the this will be
294:32 - previous we have not worked on whether
294:35 - it's in
294:36 - the favorite list or in the defa song
294:40 - list so let's work on that
294:43 - one and I think it will be up to this
294:46 - point can cut it and say that
294:50 - if self. stack widget do
294:56 - current index equal to Z which is the
295:00 - default then paste it in
295:04 - a leave self. stack
295:08 - widget do current
295:12 - index to
295:14 - two then you can paste it in by I think
295:19 - you
295:20 - remember um this should be minus
295:31 - one and then this should should also be
295:35 - minus one now this one will be different
295:38 - we cannot just be pasting this one there
295:40 - the previous will be
295:42 - different so for the previous it will
295:44 - not work this way
295:46 - so if current song index is
295:51 - zero you let me delete
295:53 - it we have to check so if
295:57 - current
295:59 - uh no we made a mistake we deleted
296:03 - something is not supposed to delete so
296:05 - this is it so if song
296:10 - index is
296:12 - zero then we want to say that the
296:16 - previous
296:19 - index should now be equal to the
296:22 - length of the S the list so
296:28 - songs dot current song list so if
296:33 - the index is zero then the previous
296:36 - index is called to the length of the
296:38 - song list widget and remember that we
296:41 - have to subtract one from it because if
296:43 - it's now output is in zero and then it
296:46 - wants to go to the last item on the list
296:49 - if you take the length it will give it
296:51 - to you in a different way that the index
296:53 - works so you have to subtract one from
296:55 - it to get the index that can work well
296:57 - with the list
296:59 - widget other than that we can now say
297:01 - that so else
297:04 - previous
297:08 - index previous index should now be equal
297:12 - to uh song
297:17 - index minus
297:19 - one yes that should work so this is how
297:23 - this should be apologies for the first
297:26 - one have repl it
297:30 - here okay so this would
297:40 - work and we have to set the current rule
297:43 - separately like we did for the first one
297:46 - so this one will
297:48 - be the default yes we loaded song list
297:52 - with it and this one will
297:57 - be list widget and they should take care
298:01 - of those ones for us so let's see what
298:04 - we are left yet or left to do for the
298:08 - favorit we have done all these things
298:10 - then we work and then we can um play a
298:14 - song of course
298:16 - the the pause and un pause works I pa it
298:19 - to go stop stops it by the stop there's
298:24 - something else that we have to do we do
298:25 - it very soon now if I
298:28 - play I'll go
298:31 - forward um
298:33 - the previous seems not to
298:36 - [Music]
298:49 - work oh disadvantages of copy and paste
298:54 - this should be
298:56 - favorite so one here too that one should
298:58 - be favorite list with favorite song list
299:02 - and this one should be
299:04 - favorite so be sure to CH change all of
299:07 - them be sure to change all of them other
299:09 - than that you also have the
299:11 - error so let me play previous and it's
299:15 - working so we see when I stop the song
299:18 - it stops but these things still remain
299:20 - what they are and that is a very bad
299:27 - thing so we'll be looking for stop
299:31 - song it should be here here self.
299:34 - player.
299:36 - stop and then self. music slider do set
299:42 - value you set the value to zero so I go
299:45 - to the the beginning and then s do time
299:51 - label do set text want to set that
299:55 - particular text so so I just like to use
299:57 - up strings so that would be 0 0 0
300:04 - sorry and
300:10 - slash just to set it to default and then
300:13 - for
300:15 - the remember the song names that we set
300:17 - up there so that would be self dot
300:20 - current song
300:23 - name dot set text want to set the text
300:29 - to song name go
300:33 - here and then we do a similar one for
300:36 - the current song path so that would be
300:38 - current song path and that will be song
300:42 - path goes here okay that is great now
300:46 - that should fixed it for us let's try it
300:49 - out and
300:56 - see so I'm expecting the slider to come
300:58 - to zero and then everything else to go
301:00 - back to and it did work that's
301:06 - great and so I think now we have to come
301:09 - to the playlist functions uh we done
301:12 - with all the favorites at least for now
301:14 - yes we have we are done and the rest
301:17 - will come and right it later when we
301:19 - bring in the actions we are doing it one
301:21 - step at a
301:23 - time so on there we
301:27 - have seate
301:31 - functions
301:37 - and then here we have the
301:39 - playlist functions the first thing is to
301:42 - try and create a new playlist
301:45 - so
302:00 - create of course it's to put it in a
302:03 - tricept block so
302:09 - creating a
302:12 - new playlist error and then the error
302:16 - will
302:18 - come you know we have to now check if
302:21 - the playlist already exists then you
302:23 - cannot create it so we can now say
302:27 - existing equal to you remember we
302:31 - created a function here called get
302:32 - playlist tables
302:34 - here this is what we'll be using so get
302:38 - playlist
302:41 - tables calling it be sure to import it
302:49 - okay get playlist tables and
302:53 - then we remember there's a small popup
302:56 - that came that you can type something in
302:58 - and then get the written the value that
303:01 - comes so without
303:03 - name this one to rains a second that you
303:05 - are not really interested in you can
303:07 - print it out and check what it is and so
303:10 - that will be
303:11 - QT
303:16 - wiget then we have
303:21 - it we just just import it we need dot um
303:27 - Q
303:28 - input dialogue this one do get test so
303:34 - it's a dialog that will pop up you want
303:35 - to get the test from that particular
303:36 - dialog yourself and
303:39 - then that be the first parameter then we
303:42 - also want to get the title that will
303:44 - show can say create a
303:48 - new
303:49 - playlist and
303:55 - then the see there it will be like a a
303:58 - line edit or like a form field or
304:02 - something like that
304:03 - and so I can now see that the prompt for
304:05 - the user to know what to do is
304:07 - enter
304:09 - playlist
304:11 - name why is the self angry
304:20 - at but why am I even creating a function
304:23 - without the Define okay so
304:27 - Define newcore
304:31 - playlist
304:36 - and it should be in there how did I
304:38 - manage to do that okay so this will give
304:41 - us the name also and we can say that if
304:45 - name equal to an empty
304:51 - string or should be even more careful
304:54 - can say name dot
304:58 - STP the person the person just hit the
305:00 - space bar multiple times you can still
305:03 - get it so that means you didn't type any
305:05 - name that be K message
305:07 - box do
305:09 - information self and then can see name
305:14 - error and the actual message
305:17 - be
305:19 - play list
305:24 - name cannot be
305:29 - empty
305:31 - okay and then afterwards we
305:44 - return
305:47 - else if
305:50 - name not
305:53 - in
305:55 - existing because if the name of the
305:57 - playlist exists you shouldn't be
305:58 - creating it again so if name not in
306:01 - existing then we want to
306:05 - say we have the function there create
306:07 - database or database table some like
306:10 - that the first one yeah this one now we
306:13 - are using it
306:15 - again create database a database
306:18 - table and then now we have to pass in
306:21 - the table name which is the name that
306:23 - the person
306:27 - typed so that should create a database
306:29 - table for us which is the playlist
306:31 - Remember that creat a column call songs
306:33 - and that is what we
306:35 - use we have a function to load playlists
306:38 - so s.
306:40 - [Music]
306:41 - load
306:43 - playlist that should the fun that's the
306:45 - function that we should write
306:49 - and let me comment it out for
306:53 - now so if name is not inexistent that is
306:56 - what will happen but if the name is in
306:58 - existent and the person still wants to
306:59 - create it then the person wants to
307:00 - overwrite the one that is there we can
307:03 - give the person chance to do that so
307:08 - a name
307:12 - in
307:13 - existing we can through a
307:16 - caution I think we can get a question
307:18 - one of those questions from
307:27 - here but this one we name it
307:31 - caution
307:38 - and then this place will
307:42 - be
307:45 - replace
307:47 - playlist and this action
307:49 - will um no no this this is not this
307:53 - should not be the syntax
307:55 - so you can
307:58 - see uh
308:00 - playlist with
308:03 - name
308:08 - yeah
308:09 - name I was trying to play SM with Pyon
308:12 - but it didn't give me the F so I have to
308:14 - bring it here myself with name name
308:17 - exists so
308:19 - already
308:27 - exist do you want to place it so in that
308:34 - case the user wants to replace it and
308:37 - yes our options remain the
308:40 - same maybe you can put the name in
308:43 - double
308:46 - quotes if message is yes then we
308:50 - can or the person chooses yes then we
308:52 - can there's one function called delete
308:55 - database table it should be down there
308:58 - this
309:00 - one you have to first delete the
309:05 - table the table name in this case will
309:08 - be name because they will be the
309:11 - same and let's be sure to import it so
309:15 - you delete the table the database table
309:18 - and then we want to create database or
309:23 - database table which and again we will
309:25 - create it as F name
309:29 - okay and then ourself will load playlist
309:32 - should be here
309:40 - again
309:44 - okay that should do and so let's quickly
309:47 - create that function the self. load
309:49 - playlist it should be the top let's
309:54 - see so
309:57 - load
309:59 - playlist
310:01 - into
310:07 - H find so loore
310:15 - playlist oh it shouldn't be shouldn't be
310:19 - that that way you find this at s will
310:23 - come in
310:28 - here okay so all our playlist should
310:32 - should be equal to get playlist tables
310:36 - remember that one and then
310:39 - playlist do remove I want to remove the
310:42 - favorites from
310:46 - it but it's not part it's not part of
310:49 - the users playlist it's a default one so
310:51 - self
310:53 - do playlist list wiget
310:56 - here do clear you understand why you
310:59 - should be doing these things the
311:00 - clearing and then after that we can see
311:04 - that
311:06 - for
311:08 - playlist in
311:12 - playlist and this one to you add an an
311:15 - icon plus the playlist itself so I
311:17 - believe that we've done it two times so
311:19 - I can type it straight forward without
311:21 - further
311:22 - explanations so s
311:26 - do
311:28 - play let L reg do add item
311:33 - and that will still be a k list wiget
311:36 - item the first one being a k
311:39 - icon which we copy the PA and paste soon
311:43 - but this one we are just placing the
311:44 - playlist inside just like that so let's
311:47 - get the icon from
311:49 - here think it should be this one which
311:51 - one I think it's this
311:53 - yep copy it and then paste it in there
311:59 - so that should do it for us yep M
312:03 - anytime we need to to load it for us so
312:06 - let's come at the top here and then
312:10 - connect the new playlist and we have
312:13 - another one yet no let's un comment this
312:16 - and then let's un comment this one too
312:19 - so we can come up here and just as we
312:23 - call the load playlist into app let's
312:26 - call the self.
312:30 - load load
312:32 - um
312:35 - playlist
312:37 - and for the connection let's create one
312:42 - for
312:45 - playlist the serve
312:48 - do I think it should be ising new
312:51 - playlist ptn yep it should be this one
312:54 - do
312:56 - click do
312:58 - connect want to connect to self do uh we
313:02 - will call it in something new playlist I
313:05 - think it's this one yep so this is it
313:08 - let's try it out and
313:11 - see if it works we should have the
313:13 - database table let's see let's see first
313:15 - if we have closed closed the connection
313:18 - and so playlist side create new you see
313:21 - the popup that came this we call
313:24 - test we press enter and then we see test
313:28 - here with a beautiful icon fantastic so
313:31 - if if we close our app and then come
313:34 - back here open
313:36 - database you have more than one table
313:38 - now if you browse the structure you see
313:40 - the test is already there great so let's
313:43 - close come back here now we know that
313:46 - that one is working and so let's go
313:49 - ahead with the rest of the database
313:50 - functions that we need to do okay so now
313:53 - let's work on the deleting of a
313:58 - playlist so
314:00 - delete
314:02 - uh
314:03 - play
314:06 - list which should be so the particular
314:10 - playlist that we want to
314:14 - delete should we go to self do
314:19 - playlist uh list wiget this
314:23 - one dot current
314:27 - item yeah this one not the current the
314:30 - current item do text because we want the
314:33 - text not the not the index so this one
314:35 - will give us the text of whatever is in
314:38 - that particular line of the list wi
314:41 - it so in this case if the name of the
314:44 - playlist is test to give us TST as we
314:47 - expect and then I'll try because it's
314:51 - necessary and say maybe
314:56 - deleting playlist error here you can
315:01 - just say delete database table and then
315:05 - you pass in the particular
315:08 - playlist so we test so we don't have to
315:10 - convert with strings strings
315:12 - strings and this one to have a finally
315:15 - whatever happens we want
315:17 - to self. load
315:21 - playlist so this one will delete a
315:23 - single playlist let's work on the
315:25 - deleting of many playlist
315:27 - so
315:30 - delete
315:34 - all
315:36 - playlist and then this one we should
315:39 - still get the playlist all the playlist
315:42 - and see let's
315:45 - see we got all the playlist and then
315:49 - because we need the Nam to delete the
315:51 - database from the database we using this
315:53 - function because we still need the name
315:55 - so uh Define
316:00 - delete
316:02 - all
316:05 - playlist
316:08 - okay and then we can now say playlist
316:12 - equal to get playlist tables and then
316:17 - playlist do
316:19 - remove want to remove the favorite
316:24 - favorite
316:26 - okay and then after we remove the
316:28 - favorite we want toat this one
316:32 - okay I remove the favorite what we want
316:34 - to do is bring a caution I think we
316:37 - already copied that one somewhere know
316:41 - should be in
316:43 - my yep here
316:47 - so yes still be
316:51 - caution first we want to caution you
316:53 - that you are doing something that is
316:55 - irreversible so the caution will be
316:57 - delete this one delete your playlist so
317:02 - delete
317:04 - all playlist and this action will delete
317:08 - all playlist Del
317:12 - will
317:15 - delete
317:20 - all playlist and it cannot be reversed
317:24 - continue yes or no or cancel so if that
317:29 - is the case if the question is yes
317:33 - you want to
317:35 - try we deleting all
317:40 - playlist
317:42 - Arrow other than that
317:45 - we want to say
317:47 - for
317:51 - playlist playlist in
317:56 - playlist
317:58 - delete database table
318:03 - playlist so it will just look through
318:06 - and delete each of them one by one and
318:10 - as you have guessed there should be our
318:13 - finally block
318:21 - here load playlist y that should also be
318:26 - it and let's see how we can add a
318:29 - particular song to
318:32 - playlist a
318:33 - playlist well I just want us to create
318:36 - all of them then we will do the
318:37 - connection that will be
318:40 - faster but I'm hope I'm explaining
318:42 - things as these things as they are
318:44 - supposed to be explained so add a
318:48 - song to a
318:53 - playlist
318:58 - okay
319:00 - uh
319:11 - you remember in the demo when we are
319:12 - adding a song to a
319:14 - playlist uh what we call a drop down if
319:19 - you are coming from web development or a
319:21 - combo box if you are this python time
319:25 - from T this place I think is also called
319:28 - a combo box but in web terms it's a drop
319:31 - down
319:31 - that contains all the existing
319:34 - database
319:35 - favorites so we have to get those ones
319:38 - and then let the user select which of
319:40 - them you want they want to add the songs
319:42 - to and it's quite quite easy so we can
319:44 - just say options equal
319:47 - to get playlist tables this function is
319:50 - really
319:51 - helpful and then options do
319:56 - remove
319:58 - remove want to
320:00 - remove
320:05 - favorites because person always options
320:09 - the person wants to add it to the F use
320:13 - add to fate
320:15 - rather and let me let me skip that part
320:18 - or let me let me do it
320:21 - options do
320:23 - insert at the zero
320:26 - position this particular string which
320:30 - is
320:32 - click
320:33 - to
320:37 - select it I'll tell you what it does but
320:40 - let me comment it now you can leave
320:41 - yours un commented and we can see that
320:45 - playlist remember how we got the
320:48 - particular playlist here where is it
320:51 - should be somewhere close
320:54 - here yeah this
320:59 - one let's copy this up come
321:03 - back and then paste it in so instead of
321:08 - name this will be
321:10 - playlist you in put
321:12 - dialog.
321:14 - [Music]
321:15 - get item rather they should be get item
321:18 - not test and then
321:20 - self yes and then this will be add
321:26 - song to playlist and here will not pass
321:32 - you can just
321:35 - say
321:37 - choose the
321:41 - desired
321:42 - playlist and you know we have to pass in
321:46 - the options also so we can say
321:50 - options and then
321:53 - editable should be false you don't want
321:55 - that to be able to edit the content in
321:57 - there
321:59 - Y and so
322:01 - so let's see and so for this one let
322:06 - me connect it here I know we are
322:09 - skipping ahead of it we wanted to do
322:11 - everything at once but let me connect it
322:14 - and
322:16 - then so that will be self
322:19 - do add song Sorry add
322:24 - song to a playlist it should be a button
322:27 - or something no let's see
322:40 - okay that is an
322:42 - action so what we will do is that we
322:44 - will link it to the load selected now
322:47 - then we will change it later so
322:52 - load selected playlist
322:56 - BTN do click do
322:59 - connect
323:02 - to self
323:04 - do add song to a playlist so that you
323:08 - see how the popup comes and I'll show
323:10 - you what I was talking
323:15 - about or if
323:18 - uh what is it I click on this thing now
323:22 - you see that test is the one that comes
323:24 - first I don't want it to always be so so
323:27 - that's why this
323:29 - uh
323:31 - it's inserted so when this is inserted
323:34 - this is how it will
323:37 - come so click to select then we now can
323:40 - select test and that is I think this is
323:43 - really cool and so once we get it now
323:47 - you have to perform some checks so
323:51 - if playlist equal to this click to
323:55 - select
323:56 - here that means the person did not
323:58 - select
323:59 - anything
324:03 - let's just make sure that everything is
324:04 - as exactly as that then it means the
324:07 - person did not select anything so we can
324:10 - Now show some info Q message box do
324:18 - info and it be add not s add
324:26 - s
324:29 - to
324:32 - playlist and we can now say
324:36 - no
324:39 - playlist uh was
324:42 - selected and then
324:45 - afterwards we are not adding anything
324:46 - again we can
324:50 - just what is this one doing
324:54 - here we can just
324:57 - return other than that that means if
325:00 - there is some selection then we want to
325:03 - do with the
325:05 - tricept and here we can see
325:15 - that current
325:17 - say uh index should be equal to self do
325:24 - loaded songl reg no loed songl current
325:30 - row this how we need a current row and
325:34 - then the song should be equal to songs
325:38 - do current song list we want it at the
325:41 - current
325:43 - index
325:46 - and
325:48 - yes why we are doing this TR and accept
325:51 - is if it doesn't work we can show an
325:56 - error here instead of the uh printing
326:00 - the
326:01 - that means this place there no song was
326:03 - selected so we can just say no
326:08 - song was selected Ian the person just
326:11 - decided to trigger the action without
326:13 - selecting the song so you can now say
326:17 - unsuccessful or something like
326:21 - that let no song was selected great and
326:25 - then after that we want to
326:27 - return I can just bring this one up
326:31 - just to save a line and do same for this
326:34 - place
326:38 - also but if all the above passes then we
326:42 - want
326:43 - to add some to database
326:46 - table and then we now pass in first the
326:50 - song which is equal to
326:53 - song and then the
326:56 - table which is we got to
326:59 - playlist so select a song and then the
327:02 - playlist
327:04 - great and then we know that we have to
327:06 - load playlist into
327:08 - yourself do load playlist into app but
327:12 - if you want to also show a successful
327:14 - message like we did for adding the song
327:16 - to favorite you can do that but I don't
327:18 - want to do that here okay the next on
327:20 - the list is
327:22 - to uh now we have add a song to playlist
327:27 - the next on the list is to add all
327:30 - current songs to a playlist so in case
327:32 - all the songs that are playing want to
327:33 - add them to the playlist we can go ahead
327:36 - and then do that
327:41 - so sh on the same liation level add
327:47 - all current
327:49 - songs to
327:51 - a
327:59 - playlist
328:15 - for this
328:17 - one this should be very similar to this
328:19 - at least to some
328:21 - extent so we can
328:24 - just paste it
328:27 - in where is
328:29 - it
328:33 - after this return you need
328:35 - it but it's just a similar things we be
328:38 - doing
328:39 - here so that is it choose the playlist
328:43 - and of that if that is the case
328:47 - and yeah yeah that check is necessary so
328:51 - we can say that if
328:54 - length of songs do current
328:59 - song
329:01 - is less than
329:04 - one or zero that means that there's no
329:07 - songs loaded because we can also use the
329:11 - list wiget to check but we can also use
329:13 - the this list to check because when it
329:16 - is loaded it will be loaded into that
329:18 - one also then we want to show an
329:20 - information so Q message box do
329:25 - information
329:27 - so and then say here
329:31 - add
329:33 - songs to
329:36 - playlist and then in here we can say
329:40 - song
329:43 - list is
329:49 - empty once again
329:52 - return other than that then it means we
329:55 - have some songs in there so we can say
329:58 - for song in
330:02 - songs.
330:04 - current not
330:06 - on in
330:09 - songs. current list what we want to do
330:13 - is to add song to database table and
330:17 - then the
330:19 - song equal to
330:21 - song and then the
330:24 - table equal to
330:27 - playlist and that should do after that
330:29 - we have have to call the loading of the
330:32 - list so s do load not look
330:37 - load playlist so that will also do for
330:42 - the uh adding all songs to the playlist
330:46 - check if it is empty if not then for
330:48 - each of the songs just add it to the
330:50 - playlist and so we can also add a
330:53 - currently playing to the playlist
330:58 - Also let's work on that
331:05 - one
331:09 - so are
331:14 - currently playing
331:17 - to
331:20 - uh
331:23 - playlist
331:29 - okay
331:45 - now this one because we are adding the
331:47 - currently playing we have to check
331:48 - whether the song is even playing in the
331:49 - first
331:50 - place so if not
331:55 - self.
331:57 - player. state
332:03 - equal to Q Media
332:06 - Player playing state that means it's not
332:09 - playing then we can now show that Q
332:12 - message
332:14 - box do
332:17 - information and then we will see in here
332:20 - that uh we
332:24 - add up current
332:28 - song two
332:32 - playlist and we can see here
332:40 - that no song
332:44 - is playing in
332:50 - Q
332:52 - yep and after that we
332:57 - return but if that is not the case
333:00 - then I think it's similar to the ad on
333:03 - to playlist up here we have to get this
333:08 - option we have to let a person choose
333:11 - the desired
333:13 - playlist and if this you can see no
333:17 - playlist was
333:18 - selected and then we
333:21 - can yeah so for this place you let's
333:27 - copy let's copy after to this return
333:30 - course we have to do things a little
333:31 - differently
333:34 - there we still have to get the playlist
333:37 - and the dropdown also that is why so to
333:40 - choose the desired playlist and all but
333:43 - if this All Passes then the
333:46 - current media that we want to add will
333:50 - now be equal to self. player do
333:55 - media and I hope you remember this from
333:58 - a previous one those so now the song
334:00 - actually will
334:06 - be current media do Canon URL you want
334:11 - to get the path and remember that you
334:15 - have to get it from the first index up
334:17 - to the last
334:20 - okay and then now we can comfortably add
334:24 - song to playlist or the database table
334:26 - where the
334:28 - song equal to song and then the
334:34 - table equals to uh equal to
334:38 - playlist
334:40 - yeah and as usual
334:42 - s. load
334:51 - playlist and we also want to probably
334:54 - load the content of a playlist to the
334:57 - song list with it so let's work on that
334:59 - function
335:00 - and then we'll be left with one more
335:01 - function for our playlist so load
335:05 - playlist
335:07 - songs to current
335:28 - list
335:31 - okay way I try accept
335:35 - so
335:38 - loading this one will take
335:40 - in the playlist
335:44 - itself yes so here will
335:49 - be loading
335:52 - songs
335:55 - from playlist as a playlist name
336:00 - and then we can fix this in here
336:03 - playlist
336:04 - errow
336:07 - okay we can see that the playlist
336:10 - songs
336:12 - play list songs as the the songs in the
336:15 - playlist equal to fetch all songs from
336:19 - database table remember this function
336:21 - and the the table we are targeting is
336:24 - the
336:25 - playlist that's the name so we just
336:27 - passing the name say if
336:30 - the length
336:31 - of uh
336:33 - playlist
336:36 - songs is
336:40 - zero we don't have to bother ourselves
336:43 - continuing we can just immediately say
336:49 - that self as
336:51 - always and then here it can be load
336:55 - playlist
336:58 - song
337:00 - and this place we can make
337:07 - it playlist is empty so that we just
337:12 - tell the person that the playlist is
337:13 - empty and of course we
337:17 - return and if that is not the case then
337:21 - that means if the length is more than
337:23 - zero then
337:25 - for song
337:28 - in playlist songs you already know what
337:32 - you want to do songs dot sorry do
337:36 - current list do append
337:40 - song and then afterwards self do
337:45 - loaded
337:47 - Lo song list
337:50 - do add
337:53 - item you know that supposed to be a k
337:56 - list wiget item which will first take in
337:59 - the Q
338:01 - icon know this
338:04 - one icon we will copy and P the pass
338:06 - very soon but the next is the os. path
338:11 - do base name of the song just like we
338:15 - are loading it fresh from our computer
338:18 - but this place let's get
338:22 - the I have really
338:24 - forgotten the particular icon we
338:27 - used but I think it should be the this
338:38 - one yes it should be that
338:40 - one but that will also load all the
338:43 - songs into the current song list for
338:48 - us and for now that is all we can do for
338:52 - now for the playlist so until what is
338:56 - left now we cannot do it now until we
338:59 - get to some other place let's
339:02 - also I think for the playlist as set we
339:05 - create the actions we cannot really
339:09 - canot
339:10 - really add so many things here apart
339:13 - from removing selected removing all and
339:16 - then loading
339:18 - selected okay even if you do that you
339:20 - cannot really add a song to the playlist
339:23 - so let's let's still connect them so
339:27 - that we
339:28 - don't get confused know that we are done
339:32 - with
339:40 - it playlist sh we
339:49 - here so this one is load you have to
339:52 - connect it to
339:55 - load and
339:58 - load
340:00 - playlist songs to current but remember
340:03 - we have to pass in we have to pass in
340:06 - the particular playlist of Interest so
340:08 - we let bring this one to the next line
340:11 - we have to pass in
340:13 - Lambda because we are come to pass in
340:16 - some arguments or parameter also so we
340:19 - have to now pass in the particular
340:21 - playlist that we want to load and which
340:24 - would be equal to self dot playlist
340:28 - which is
340:30 - do current
340:33 - item do
340:36 - text so let me space everything else
340:40 - neatly this text should
340:44 - also okay so this is what we have to
340:50 - do but you know when the app run when
340:54 - run our app now we will get an
340:58 - error oh okay okay okay okay it didn't
341:01 - really give the
341:02 - error but when you click on load
341:04 - selected that it's giving us an
341:07 - error okay so there just instance that
341:09 - the person may not really select the
341:11 - playlist but to click on it so let's
341:14 - just wrap it in the TR accept
341:18 - block this one we not add any exception
341:21 - just pass it okay so in this case when
341:25 - we come here we are still good to go is
341:28 - it still closing
341:31 - why is it
341:32 - closing i l should close why is it
341:36 - closing obviously not from this one
341:38 - because a try accept have let me just
341:43 - see so playlist is Mt is
341:47 - working is that when you click on it it
341:50 - does without any
341:52 - selection doesn't give us any warning
341:54 - but
341:57 - closes let's see whether there's this is
342:00 - one of the places
342:03 - where these errors are difficult to fix
342:06 - I don't really know why but you let's
342:07 - finish the app we just still test it and
342:09 - see if it behaves that way then we know
342:13 - how to see how we can deug
342:17 - it okay but at least we know that if
342:20 - there was something in there it would
342:21 - load it for us that one we know and then
342:23 - we also have to connect the remove
342:26 - selected and all so self do
342:30 - remove selected playlist BTN do
342:35 - click do
342:37 - connect you want to connect it to self
342:41 - do we call delete playlist
342:47 - Y and then there's another one that we
342:50 - created also for the removal of our
342:54 - playlist as weel
342:57 - do remove or playlist BN dot
343:04 - click do connect want to connect it to
343:08 - self
343:09 - do
343:11 - delete all
343:13 - playlist and then the other one that we
343:15 - have to do is the adding of a song to a
343:19 - playlist so self.
343:24 - add add to playlist BT and this one do
343:30 - click
343:33 - dot connect remember we created one that
343:37 - will add a current song to playlist so
343:41 - s.
343:44 - add song to
343:48 - playlist is I currently playing to
343:51 - playlist this
343:53 - one yep that's one to will do for us so
343:58 - that means that we can add a song to
344:00 - playlist if we start playing it
344:03 - here feeling
344:05 - happy add to
344:07 - playlist I oh sorry I've had many times
344:14 - I just thinking that I'm clicking on the
344:17 - out to playist so it says I choose test
344:21 - okay only one way to confirm
344:24 - this is to for now come here hope open
344:29 - the
344:30 - database and then go to browse data and
344:33 - then change this from to test and you
344:35 - see that the song is in there now if we
344:39 - close our
344:41 - database run our
344:44 - app and then come to this playlist
344:47 - select it and load you will see that it
344:50 - it will actually load it here you can
344:52 - click on it and play and it will work so
344:56 - that is great let us move on on to there
345:00 - are a lot of things at the faite side
345:01 - that we did not do let us complete all
345:03 - of them and then take our hands
345:09 - off so let's
345:11 - see any of this wants to link us to
345:14 - favorite I think we only
345:15 - created remove from favorites and then
345:20 - remove all we also have able to add the
345:23 - songs to favorites let's see what we are
345:26 - yet to
345:27 - do
345:30 - so we can add a song to favorit We can
345:33 - load the favorite into
345:35 - app
345:38 - and you don't have functions to add all
345:41 - songs to faite you have function to
345:43 - remove
345:50 - song so let's work on the add all songs
345:53 - to
345:55 - favorites
345:57 - here
346:21 - so we can check so
346:23 - if the length
346:25 - of songs do current song list it's less
346:31 - than one like we did for the
346:35 - playlist or let's just make it equal to
346:37 - you can make it equal to zero or less
346:39 - than one then Q message
346:42 - box do
346:44 - information self as
346:47 - always
346:49 - um here will be add
346:52 - song have
346:55 - songs to
346:57 - favorite
347:01 - no favorite is it favorite or favorit
347:04 - any of them and we can now here say that
347:08 - no
347:11 - songs have
347:13 - been loaded
347:17 - great and then we
347:21 - return but if that is not the case then
347:25 - for
347:26 - song in songs
347:29 - dot current song list what we want to do
347:33 - is add song to database table and then
347:38 - we have the
347:39 - song then the table will be
347:44 - favorit is favorites or favorite I think
347:48 - it's favorit with an
347:51 - S uh yep I think
347:57 - so and you remember we have to load a
348:00 - favorite into app so s. load
348:03 - favores into app this one so now we have
348:07 - the function to add all songs to
348:09 - favorites
348:14 - also remove song from favorite do you
348:17 - have that
348:18 - one remove one song from
348:21 - favorite we also have remove all songs
348:24 - from favorites now I think we have all
348:26 - we need for the favorites
348:29 - yes we
348:30 - do okay so let's see which ones have we
348:34 - not connected
348:37 - it the F
348:39 - side yes we
348:42 - do
348:45 - so for the add all songs to fa you
348:47 - cannot test it now because you don't
348:49 - have the context menu yet so I think the
348:53 - obvious the next obvious thing for us to
348:55 - do is to create the context menus so
348:58 - that we can test out all these functions
349:00 - that we are writing so back
349:05 - here down there we
349:08 - can uh let me just check the ination so
349:11 - we can now create our context
349:18 - menus
349:20 - okay the first one that we will create
349:22 - is the
349:25 - playlist context menu
349:29 - a context menu is this I've been talking
349:30 - about this a lot this right click you
349:32 - see when I right click this thing that
349:33 - popped out that's what we call a context
349:39 - menu okay so for the
349:43 - playlist this is how we okay should be a
349:45 - function so Define
349:47 - playlist
349:50 - context
349:52 - menu
349:54 - okay and then we now see that self.
349:57 - playlist list wi this
350:00 - one do
350:04 - set context menu policy
350:07 - to
350:09 - qt.
350:12 - action actions context menu because we
350:14 - want to add actions to it the actions
350:18 - here that were created in our file here
350:20 - I showed you earlier in the
350:22 - video this actions want to add them
350:26 - okay and then we can see self do
350:29 - playlist list widget
350:33 - again do add
350:38 - action now I have to add the action
350:40 - before so self
350:42 - do action let's start with the load
350:45 - selected
350:48 - playlist and then let's add a separator
350:50 - so we can say
350:52 - separator equal to kill
350:57 - action this one we have to call it yep
351:00 - and then passing s don't
351:05 - forget
351:07 - okay and then we can say SE
351:12 - paror do set
351:15 - separator quite weird and we can now say
351:19 - true sorry
351:22 - true okay then the rest will be
351:24 - following so we can now say s that is if
351:29 - you want to add you see this place uh
351:32 - there this lines that that separates
351:33 - them that's the separator if you want to
351:35 - add it fine if you don't want to you can
351:37 - just keep it so s do playlist list
351:41 - widget do add action let's add the rest
351:45 - this one will
351:48 - be
351:50 - action delete selected playlist
351:55 - action
351:56 - delete no no no self. action delete
351:59 - selected pleas so
352:01 - self do
352:04 - action
352:07 - delete selected playlist and you have
352:11 - guess right the next one will be action
352:13 - delete all playlist so action
352:19 - delete all playlist and I think that
352:22 - should be all for the playlist context
352:25 - menu let's just copy it
352:28 - the next context menu that we will
352:31 - create is the
352:36 - loaded
352:37 - songs
352:39 - context menu comment it
352:44 - out and then paste it in
352:47 - here well actually copy the comment
352:53 - too so this one will be
352:56 - called as the comment implies loaded _
353:01 - songs context menu and here you know
353:05 - that you have to change everything that
353:07 - looks like this
353:09 - to loaded song list widget but these are
353:13 - not the actions will be adding here the
353:16 - first one will be
353:19 - action
353:21 - previous duplicate it
353:24 - twice action
353:26 - nextest and then the next one will
353:29 - be action stop oh what did I just
353:34 - do action
353:38 - stop okay for the separator we can leave
353:42 - it as it is and what I'll do is to copy
353:46 - this we need it down
353:48 - here so replace
353:51 - this after um
353:55 - previous and next I think before that we
353:59 - should have even
354:00 - had the first two and then the separator
354:05 - comes
354:09 - in but we only need two here for the
354:13 - play and then P I think they should ref
354:15 - first to action
354:19 - play
354:21 - action pause on pause that is here so
354:24 - that one to has been added and then this
354:26 - place we can
354:28 - say
354:30 - action add selected to favorite please
354:34 - this actions you have to type the name
354:36 - exactly as I'm doing other than that you
354:37 - may have to change their names
354:40 - here so after adding the one that to
354:44 - favorite you have to get
354:46 - action add all to
354:50 - favorite and
354:52 - then action add selected so action
355:03 - add selected to favorites this
355:08 - one no no no no uh this one okay okay it
355:12 - doesn't matter I wanted this one to be
355:15 - down rather but it doesn't matter okay
355:20 - and
355:21 - then we need it one more
355:24 - time so let's copy it that that place
355:27 - you have has a lot of actions that is
355:30 - why but I just hope that you really
355:33 - understand what is going just adding the
355:34 - actions and then separating them by line
355:36 - so that we get them like this one is oh
355:39 - I just did something that was not
355:41 - supposed to do
355:44 - okay what was it that I clicked folding
355:47 - or
355:48 - what okay I don't care so after to fate
355:53 - what we need is I think we need just two
355:54 - more for the playlist so
356:00 - action save selected to save selected to
356:05 - a
356:06 - playlist and then we have
356:08 - action save all to a playlist great so
356:13 - this one will give us that one we are
356:15 - left with one more which is the favorite
356:19 - context menu so let's just copy maybe up
356:22 - to this place that we don't really need
356:25 - much there so
356:31 - past why it usually goes in by one
356:35 - indentation so this should
356:42 - be
356:43 - favorite songs context menu so self
356:48 - Define favorite songs context menu and
356:52 - you know that everything here that looks
356:55 - like this has to change to
356:58 - favorite list widget like that the last
357:02 - one we even need it delete
357:05 - it that's why we not even add any
357:09 - separator add any separator we need only
357:11 - three so without any separator the first
357:14 - one is
357:17 - action remove no action remove selected
357:23 - from
357:24 - favorite and then
357:26 - action remove all from favorates
357:30 - this one is not even
357:33 - needed okay so now we have to make
357:35 - connections to this our context
357:38 - menu okay so we have to call them at the
357:41 - top for them to work uh the top at the
357:43 - top at the top at the top after global
357:46 - before the database tab we can just
357:49 - say uh
357:51 - context
357:53 - menus and in here we can say s do
357:58 - playlist context
358:01 - menu self do
358:04 - loaded s context menu then s do
358:09 - favorite context
358:13 - menu okay so now when we right click we
358:15 - should see all those functions popping
358:19 - up so here and I right click you see
358:21 - that all the things are popping up it
358:23 - looks like the line is not really
358:25 - showing but no problem and so yes that
358:29 - is it the stops icon is not really
358:32 - showing no problem uh you can easily fix
358:36 - it by coming to the actions here where
358:38 - is the action
358:41 - stop you double click on it you change
358:44 - the icon here fer
358:47 - resource but in that case we have to run
358:50 - our commands again that is no problem
358:52 - because it wouldn't really affect
358:55 - it okay make sure that I'm in this
359:00 - page now we've made changes to it
359:03 - so let's
359:06 - save and one of the reasons that I don't
359:09 - usually modify my main.py because now I
359:12 - have to bring this one up remember this
359:14 - one and then now run this command
359:20 - again now you should fix this thing for
359:25 - us this is how the stop is so that we
359:28 - just make changes to it and run it
359:29 - without having any problems but if you
359:31 - come to the playlist side it has it
359:34 - separate context menu for the favorites
359:38 - it also has a SE separate context menu
359:40 - so what we are left to do now is to
359:43 - connect all these actions to their
359:46 - respective functions also so let's come
359:49 - up
359:53 - here in fact when I was doing the build
359:55 - it threw some error when I place it in
359:58 - there directly that's why I place it in
360:00 - the tricept now so there's also an
360:02 - action called self.
360:04 - action action
360:07 - load selected
360:10 - playlist but actions are not clicked
360:12 - they are
360:13 - triggered
360:15 - trigger do
360:19 - connect and then it will be the same
360:22 - here so I can just paste it in to Lo the
360:28 - playlist that is so easy so I can also
360:33 - come here in the connections I just
360:38 - say
360:40 - playlist actions so I I give all the
360:43 - playlist actions there so self do
360:48 - action action save or to a playlist.
360:55 - tricket do connect
360:58 - I want to connect it
361:00 - to self do add
361:06 - all current songs to your playlist this
361:13 - one course you've created all these
361:15 - functions down there already and this
361:17 - self dot
361:20 - action save selected to a playlist do
361:26 - triggered do connect we want to connect
361:30 - this one to self do add
361:36 - song add a song to playlist this one and
361:40 - then there's also
361:42 - self do
361:45 - action
361:47 - delete
361:49 - delete all playlist do
361:53 - triggered do connect we want to connect
361:56 - this one also to s. delete all
362:03 - playlist it should be somewhere
362:06 - delete
362:08 - all playlist yes this
362:11 - one and then the last one for this one
362:14 - will be self
362:16 - dot action
362:19 - delete delete selected playlist.
362:24 - triet do connect we want to connect it
362:28 - to S
362:30 - do
362:34 - delete playlist oh yeah this
362:37 - one okay so that is all for the playlist
362:41 - actions we can go ahead and do that for
362:43 - the favorite
362:47 - also under the favorite like
362:50 - this you can say
362:54 - favorite
362:56 - actions then self do
363:01 - action add selected to favorites do
363:07 - trigger want to connect this one
363:14 - to self. add song to favores sometimes
363:18 - like that add song to favorites
363:23 - yep and then let's duplicate it for a
363:26 - number of times I think the are four of
363:27 - them and this one will
363:30 - be
363:34 - action add we should have add all to
363:37 - favor yes the trigger should
363:39 - be add all or something like that all
363:44 - songs to favores
363:47 - yes and the next one is remove selected
363:52 - favorites
363:54 - action remove selected favorite
363:57 - I remove only one song from the favorite
364:00 - that will be self.
364:03 - delete
364:06 - delete delete
364:13 - selected or you call it
364:17 - remove
364:19 - remove song from favorites this
364:26 - one and then this will
364:29 - be
364:31 - action
364:33 - remove all
364:35 - favorites and that one should
364:39 - be
364:41 - remove all songs from
364:46 - favorites let's just confirm to see that
364:48 - these are the name of the methods that
364:50 - is
364:52 - true so what we are left to do now is to
364:56 - also add the con C to
364:58 - the the song list page okay so default
365:06 - page uh actions something like
365:11 - that and that one will be self
365:14 - doaction
365:17 - play do
365:19 - triggered do connect want you to connect
365:23 - to self
365:25 - do play I think is is it play song or
365:28 - play yeah Play song I think we have it
365:31 - for about five times so let me just
365:34 - duplicate it and then the next one You'
365:36 - guess right is action pause and on pause
365:41 - that will be S do
365:43 - pause and un pause just like this and
365:47 - then
365:49 - action next so action next should be Ser
365:56 - do next
365:59 - song and then this is action
366:04 - previous should be S
366:07 - do
366:10 - previous hey previous song not
366:13 - BTN where are you going BTN and self
366:18 - do action
366:26 - stop s
366:28 - do stop
366:31 - s
366:34 - yep so I think this is all all our
366:37 - things should be working now I
366:41 - guess let's just test a few of them out
366:44 - but all of them should be
366:48 - working so let me load a song
366:54 - here and then
366:57 - let me see add selected to playlist it
367:02 - gives me the opportunity to add it to
367:05 - playlist and then let me add Tech out
367:08 - vibes also to the playlist and then we
367:11 - will verify it from our DB function but
367:14 - if I right click and hit play start is
367:18 - playing but you can go to previous it's
367:21 - working the nest it's working the
367:25 - pause and pause
367:28 - and then
367:29 - the stop is also working if I come to
367:33 - favorite side now of course I should be
367:36 - playing a song for for me to see it at
367:38 - to
367:39 - favorite and so song list very happy
367:42 - Christmas
367:44 - play if I go to add selected to favorite
367:49 - I should see a very happy Christmas at
367:50 - the end of the list and it is there so
367:53 - uh it is working let's come to the
367:55 - playlist side
367:58 - [Music]
368:02 - so do you really want to delete this no
368:04 - so let's create new let's a
368:07 - new new one so this new one let's use it
368:11 - for the delete selected you go delete
368:15 - all you get this one and you say no and
368:18 - then to
368:19 - favorate feeling happy is multiple times
368:23 - let me just Del
368:25 - some
368:30 - [Music]
368:31 - okay so you know that all these things I
368:32 - also working for I go to remov I get a
368:34 - caution and I ccel out so our context
368:37 - menu is
368:39 - working what we have to do now in the
368:42 - app I think there are just about two
368:43 - things that we are done the
368:46 - first is obviously not the first thing
368:48 - we are doing but what we are left with
368:50 - is to be able to view the content of a
368:54 - playlist and that should be done by
368:56 - double clicking so let's close it out
368:59 - for now and then come down
369:02 - to come down down down down on to where
369:06 - the playlist items are I think it's here
369:09 - yes and just before the context menu we
369:12 - just want to group all things at one
369:13 - side that relates to a particular thing
369:16 - so we have to create a function that
369:18 - will
369:20 - show
369:25 - play list
369:27 - content and let's go
369:31 - Define
369:32 - showcore
369:34 - playlist underscore
369:37 - content
369:39 - okay for this one I'm going to teach you
369:43 - how to create custom wigets in uh it be
369:48 - a custom wget I think so close your
369:50 - custom widget in P5 again if you want to
369:54 - learn all of these things you want to
369:56 - know custom Wes and how to use all of
369:58 - these in applications like if you want
370:00 - to really learn the P well I you check
370:03 - out my channel Tom codebase the link
370:05 - will be in the description I have
370:08 - interesting applications just like this
370:09 - one for you to practice with but for now
370:12 - let's do
370:13 - trbe and then let's say
370:19 - showing
370:22 - showing
370:24 - playlist content
370:30 - error
370:36 - okay so the playlist the particular
370:39 - playlist that you want to show the
370:41 - content should be S do playlist list
370:45 - wiget
370:50 - here current item dot text that should
370:54 - give it to us and then songs is equal to
370:59 - fetch all songs from database table then
371:02 - we pass in this particular playlist so
371:04 - that it purchas the songs from the
371:05 - database table for us we use it only
371:08 - here
371:10 - and let's just for now print these
371:13 - things out and see what happen so
371:19 - print
371:22 - print and then you can say
371:25 - playlist
371:31 - let me duplicate
371:33 - it and then
371:37 - songs songs I think we may have to do
371:40 - something extra here but for this one
371:42 - the connection will be uh something a
371:45 - bit a bit different from what we have
371:49 - seen what we want to do now is that if
371:52 - we double click on any song in the play
371:56 - playlist widgets then we can show the
371:59 - playlist content so let's come
372:04 - up is playlist so let's keep it at the
372:08 - very
372:09 - top Ser playlist list
372:13 - widget do
372:17 - item double
372:20 - clicked so if an item is double clicked
372:22 - we want to
372:24 - connect it to
372:27 - self.
372:29 - show playlist
372:32 - content like that and so let's see what
372:35 - we will get in our
372:45 - terminal so you see that
372:48 - the we get yes you get a test the
372:51 - playlist and then the songs okay that's
372:53 - great so we know that these are the
372:54 - songs in our particular playlist
372:56 - now let's go back to
372:59 - development instead of pointing it to
373:03 - the what did we just click instead of
373:05 - printing it to the terminal what we'll
373:08 - be doing is that a little popup will
373:11 - show another window will pop up and then
373:13 - we will display all these songs inside
373:16 - like we we saw in the demo so we will
373:19 - create one more file and this will be
373:22 - our
373:25 - last
373:29 - you call
373:31 - it playlist under SC
373:39 - popup I will add it later Pon and so now
373:43 - we have it like this what we want to do
373:48 - here is
373:51 - from P qt5 we want to import sorry we
373:57 - want to import QT widget and then we
374:01 - want to import QT GUI we also want to
374:06 - import QT core and that is all we need
374:09 - to
374:12 - import and then a class of we can call
374:16 - it
374:17 - playlist
374:19 - dialogue that is I think it's a best
374:22 - name so QT
374:25 - widget. kill
374:27 - dialogue this is inheriting from that
374:35 - class soore in
374:39 - it and call make the super call here
374:43 - too and here we have to pass in
374:51 - parents
374:52 - okay so for this place we will take
374:56 - after s we taking other things
374:59 - also and it will be the data that will
375:03 - be showed inside this particular popup
375:06 - we also have the list name you can
375:09 - rename this to any proper term this will
375:12 - just be the title that of the window
375:15 - that will show so you want to make the
375:17 - title Dynamic so if I double click on
375:18 - test it should see songs in test if I
375:20 - double click on another playlist say CS
375:23 - should say songs in CS that is the list
375:26 - name that I'm giving so you can actually
375:27 - make a title if you think it's best or
375:30 - you want make a title yeah title and
375:34 - then see this parents have passed here
375:35 - so I can I have to say now that parents
375:37 - equal to N is a stand alone thing that
375:40 - is popping
375:42 - up okay and then self. data equal to
375:48 - data self do title should be equal to
375:53 - title it's no minus is equal to title
375:57 - and then what we need to do
376:00 - self do set window not outside of this
376:06 - so do
376:09 - set window
376:15 - title that will be an F
376:18 - string and then we say here that songs
376:22 - in sorry
376:24 - in and then
376:28 - then um solve do title I think I'm
376:34 - beginning to like my list name but it's
376:37 - okay we have already used this one and
376:40 - then self do set
376:44 - geometry 550 is where we want it to be
376:48 - and then
376:49 - 200 and then
376:53 - 400 300 if you look at it here you see
376:56 - that a x a y a a w ah so the first one
377:01 - is the X Y we start from on the screen
377:03 - 500 in the X Direction by pixels also
377:07 - and then for the Y is be 200 down and
377:10 - then the width 400 the height 300 let me
377:14 - make the weight Al 500 in
377:18 - Cas and then
377:23 - self do set we want to set the minimum
377:27 - size also so set minimum size which is
377:30 - QT
377:32 - core
377:34 - dot k
377:38 - size and we want to set it to 500 by
377:42 - this
377:44 - one we don't want it to be resizable
377:46 - that is just what we are doing so we
377:47 - setting minimum and maximum to the same
377:51 - so set if you don't want that option you
377:53 - can skip this one so set maximum size
377:56 - also to this so that it is not
377:59 - resizable then then we create a list Wes
378:01 - inside this our small popup so we can
378:04 - say s dot
378:09 - playlist with this has nothing to do
378:11 - with the one we have been working with
378:13 - it is one that we are creating it is
378:15 - only for this application or for this
378:17 - purup so that would be QT
378:20 - widget dot kill
378:23 - list widgets
378:28 - okay and then we passing self
378:33 - here we want it to fill the whole window
378:37 - that we show so we have to now give it a
378:40 - layout and then make the layouts do the
378:44 - responsive style fill everything inside
378:47 - that is what you want to do and so what
378:50 - we have to do here is say
378:53 - layout so that q t
378:56 - widget do QV box
379:00 - layout that one to goes into self and
379:03 - then we can say
379:06 - layout without layout how will you add
379:09 - even the items now layout. add with s do
379:13 - playlist widget after that you have to
379:16 - add this layout uh let me
379:20 - see okay now we can see self do playlist
379:24 - widget. add items this time around we
379:27 - adding all the items so that will be the
379:30 - data that we are passing in and yes I
379:34 - just hope that this is not confusing
379:36 - because it's isn't confusing at all I
379:38 - think this should
379:41 - do the trick so we only have to pass in
379:44 - the data and then the title let us use
379:47 - it in application here and
379:50 - see so instead of
379:54 - printing
379:56 - what we want to do
379:59 - is we create an instance of this
380:01 - playlist dialogue so
380:03 - playlist uncore
380:05 - dialogue should be equal
380:08 - to
380:12 - playlist pop app I think that is the
380:16 - name let me try and
380:18 - import come on P Pam
380:21 - okay you call it play dialog I think
380:24 - yeah there a f name that is
380:26 - playlist dialog popup but this one is
380:29 - playlist dialogue so be sure to import
380:35 - it where is it coming from yep and here
380:39 - we have to pass in the data and then the
380:43 - title so the data is
380:46 - songs and then the title is the name of
380:51 - the playlist so let's just give it on F
380:54 - string and then can say
380:57 - playlist okay and for it to show we have
381:00 - to say playlist
381:02 - dialogue
381:04 - dotac with the
381:06 - underscore and this should do all the
381:12 - trick so we come here double click it
381:15 - I'm sorry it came to the second screen
381:16 - let me bring it is that we have it here
381:20 - isn't this amazing this is working but
381:25 - obviously not how we expected it to be
381:28 - so let us now show only the file name in
381:32 - of the the long file PA so we can just
381:36 - come here and
381:37 - say
381:39 - songs say only equal
381:43 - to OS in a list comprehension so os.
381:48 - path do base name
381:53 - song for song in not on in
382:00 - songs okay so here instead of passing
382:03 - song you have to pass songs songs only
382:07 - and that should do the
382:14 - trick what doing at the second screen
382:16 - all the time so you see that it's
382:20 - here okay so let us go ahead and
382:23 - customize it a little bit
382:26 - customize our playlist popup a little
382:29 - bit let us
382:34 - customize the
382:41 - popup the first thing I want to do is to
382:43 - hide all the scroll bars so in case the
382:46 - the content is many hide all the scroll
382:49 - bars scroll bars
382:52 - okay I'll be doing some copying and
382:54 - pasting here come to
382:57 - music
383:02 - and okay just use contr f to find scroll
383:08 - bar policy this is what I'm looking for
383:11 - so if you just set for scroll bar you
383:13 - get something that like say set vertical
383:15 - scroll bar policy set horizontal scroll
383:17 - bar policy and then let's copy this
383:22 - one and then come to playlist popup
383:27 - paste it and then this one will not be
383:30 - Ser the loaded song list which is this
383:32 - one will be self. playlist with it
383:37 - course my my songs are not many but if
383:39 - there are many now this want to hide all
383:41 - the scroll bars and make it nicer and
383:43 - then we can also customize the font you
383:45 - see that the font was actually very
383:46 - small so we
383:48 - can
383:50 - customize the
383:54 - font we can say that the font object
383:56 - equal to K font no K
384:01 - T do kill
384:05 - font
384:06 - okay and here we can say font do set
384:11 - point size that's how we set the font
384:13 - size let me give it to
384:15 - 14 and then uh font I also want to make
384:19 - it both so font do set
384:22 - bold to be true I also want to set the
384:26 - weight so Set uh font sorry do set
384:31 - weight
384:33 - 270 you can play around with these
384:35 - numbers and then after that I have to do
384:38 - self dot playlist widget do set font to
384:43 - the font that we have just created
384:47 - okay now as you see some changes in font
384:50 - if I should run it
384:54 - again
384:56 - and this one is coming to the second
384:58 - screen again you see that now is quite
385:00 - big and that is I think for me this is
385:02 - cool if you think otherwise you can can
385:06 - change the numbers
385:09 - okay and the next thing we have to do is
385:12 - to
385:13 - change
385:16 - window
385:18 - colors so that have to what we have to
385:21 - do is to say self do set Styles sheet
385:26 - this where we type our CSS so we can
385:29 - say
385:31 - background color just like CSS and then
385:35 - we just say
385:36 - rgba I already have this value here so
385:39 - I'll type it in it is 10 for
385:43 - red 25
385:46 - for uh green and then 47 for blue but we
385:51 - don't actually need the alpha so we can
385:53 - take it off like that and then you run
385:56 - it she see some
386:04 - changes you can see here that it changed
386:06 - the background actually changed and that
386:08 - is what we want but it is making our
386:11 - test almost
386:13 - invisible so let's work on that one so
386:16 - let's change sty sheet for the playlist
386:18 - widget
386:19 - also so solve. playlist widget. set
386:24 - Styles sheet
386:26 - and this
386:27 - one you can just copy it from the music.
386:31 - py the Styles sheet that is already
386:33 - there for the song list wiget I think we
386:35 - can just make use of it I need
386:38 - everything from so just look out for
386:44 - the for the find search for the S loaded
386:48 - song list wiget and then look at the
386:52 - Styles sheet copy it as I'm doing you
386:55 - can come back to playlist pop up and
386:57 - then paste it in you may not even need
386:59 - all of it of course we need a color this
387:02 - end it's not necessary we need a
387:05 - selection background color the padding
387:07 - should be okay I think I I think we need
387:11 - it that that should do let's see if it
387:13 - really makes it
387:15 - nicer excuse
387:18 - me and of course it did make it nice and
387:22 - we can now see the content here
387:25 - beautifully inside our popup so that is
387:28 - what I was trying to see now we are left
387:32 - with only one thing to do as far as I
387:35 - remember if there's anything that's left
387:36 - you inspect it and then add it but for
387:39 - now we know that we can load it and then
387:42 - it will come I didn't import any song
387:43 - but here I can play
387:45 - it and it is playing so what we are left
387:48 - to do now is that the background should
387:52 - change on every song so let's us go
387:54 - ahead and then write that function real
387:59 - quick back to our
388:01 - main.py oh already
388:04 - 730 over 730 lines of
388:07 - code okay so we here we can now
388:12 - see
388:17 - slideshow and then
388:20 - Define
388:24 - slideshow
388:27 - okay we need one more Global variable
388:29 - let's go up there and set
388:33 - it we need a
388:35 - global
388:37 - slide index that is to keep track of the
388:41 - um index of
388:44 - the of we loading the image images
388:48 - inside the path as a list and so we can
388:51 - just like we load the song so we can use
388:53 - this index to keep track of it so slide
388:57 - index should be zero at
388:59 - start okay if you copy or if you clone
389:04 - the repository which I believe you did
389:05 - then inside your you see PG images here
389:09 - these are the ones that will'll be using
389:11 - there's also the overlay image here okay
389:15 - so this is what we'll be
389:18 - calling and so back to the bottom of our
389:21 - file here we can say images
389:25 - _ paath is os.
389:31 - path.
389:33 - join what we want to join
389:37 - is os. getcwd
389:42 - and then another os. join because the
389:45 - os. get CWD will only get me the current
389:49 - working directory here but now I have to
389:51 - go into
389:52 - yours and I have to go into after inside
389:55 - details I have to go into BG images so I
389:58 - will have to join those two path also so
390:01 - that together there will be one so I can
390:03 - here say who.
390:05 - paath do
390:08 - join okay right Mr intelligence and then
390:11 - here I want to join the test U
390:15 - tails and
390:18 - also
390:20 - bore
390:22 - images that's the name oh no no it's
390:24 - bore I am I IM GS I
390:29 - am
390:31 - GS okay so this will give us the image
390:37 - path and after this we can just say
390:41 - images equal
390:43 - to os.
390:46 - path do list it's not OS do it's OS do
390:51 - just OS do list there that will give us
390:53 - all the items in the so we can just say
390:56 - images
390:57 - pass and
391:01 - then you let's print this one out so you
391:04 - see what is happening so print
391:09 - images okay so for now I
391:13 - will let's see what can I connect it
391:20 - to okay let me just modify the play song
391:24 - so s do SL I I'll change it back I just
391:28 - want you to know I'm just looking for
391:29 - one of them to give this thing
391:33 - to bring up our
391:35 - terminal and when I
391:38 - click let me change it
391:44 - back okay when I click you see that the
391:48 - names you all come here but this BG
391:50 - overlay is not one of them that you want
391:52 - to use it's always there constant it's
391:54 - this one that will be changing so you
391:57 - see that it gives not the four part it
391:59 - just gives the base names so the file
392:02 - names themselves so we have to now uh
392:05 - merge it to the path that we have
392:07 - created up there for this one so what we
392:10 - want to do is not to print it we want to
392:13 - images do
392:16 - remove and then we want to remove let's
392:19 - just copy the names that we just will be
392:23 - exact
392:25 - yes we remove this one from it and
392:29 - then call in our Global slide
392:36 - index okay so if the slide
392:40 - index is equal
392:44 - to uh okay this that we I'm doing now
392:48 - let me do it later so that you have to
392:50 - you understand it well next slide
392:55 - as the next next image is
392:59 - images uh then we want to index it using
393:02 - the slide index where is
393:05 - it let me just call it
393:10 - Global didn't have to deleted it slide
393:13 - underscore
393:15 - index to
393:18 - slide
393:20 - index yep bring this one down and then
393:26 - we can see that the
393:28 - next
393:30 - image equal to
393:33 - Q
393:37 - GUI don't we have this
393:40 - already import it from
393:43 - p5t dot want to get a k pix
393:48 - map this is how we treat the images so
393:51 - that we OS do now we passing the image
393:53 - so os. pass
393:55 - do join again we want to join the images
394:01 - path with a particular image so with the
394:06 - in an F
394:07 - string with the next slide so the next
394:11 - slide here know the next slide will give
394:14 - us you to use the index the global uh
394:16 - the slide index to give us one of these
394:18 - files depend on where it has reached so
394:20 - this is just the raw file name we need
394:23 - to add the full part to it before we can
394:24 - use it here so that's why we are joining
394:26 - it with the images path here which leads
394:29 - to the images folder where the images
394:30 - are being read from into this format and
394:33 - then just add a particular image name so
394:35 - that to give us the full part to the
394:36 - file and then after that we can say self
394:40 - do background image that is the name
394:48 - here background image that is what we'll
394:50 - be changing background
394:53 - image do set pixmap
394:58 - to next
395:01 - image and because we want it to be for
395:04 - every song we can now see that slide
395:07 - index plus sorry plus equal to
395:12 - one okay we are almost there so now what
395:17 - we have to do
395:18 - is bind this slide index to the end of
395:23 - media so when when the song ends
395:26 - remember that we created one function
395:28 - that checks for whether the song has
395:31 - ended or not and so we have to bind this
395:33 - one to it come to our connections at the
395:38 - top what did we give that one you have
395:41 - not gotten there yet where do we give
395:43 - that one this one so after the media St
395:47 - change we want to now see that
395:50 - self
395:52 - dot player
395:54 - dot media change that mean if the media
395:57 - is changed and this one will make it so
396:00 - intelligent that if I am looping a
396:02 - particular song then the media has not
396:04 - changed it's the same media that is
396:06 - playing over and over again so the
396:07 - background will not change but as soon
396:09 - as I go previous or Nest or Shuffle then
396:12 - it will change that is Source will great
396:14 - do
396:18 - connect and then I can connect to sell
396:21 - do
396:23 - slideshow
396:24 - so now we should be having some
396:26 - beautiful slideshows when we play and so
396:29 - let's run it and
396:33 - see one
396:35 - I let's play the favorit I don't want to
396:38 - load any songs now
396:41 - so I ISL this one and go next and you
396:44 - see that the background image has
396:46 - changed prev has changed next has
396:50 - changed but if I look this
396:53 - song
396:56 - [Music]
396:59 - you see that start playing again but the
397:00 - image will not
397:03 - change okay there's an
397:06 - error says it's not in the list or is
397:09 - that is not in the
397:11 - list okay let's try another one and
397:15 - see the media change and why is he
397:18 - saying that why was he saying that file
397:20 - is not in the
397:22 - list oh
397:25 - it is great that we use this so I think
397:27 - the that is the previous where should
397:33 - be previous previous previous previous
397:37 - close out of this
397:41 - previous
397:45 - wow was I clicking next to previous
397:48 - think
397:49 - next I think it should be the part
397:53 - where
397:57 - this was the looped
397:59 - Nest oh I see
398:02 - it that is simply because we have not
398:05 - declared functionality here for the
398:07 - favor side so after to
398:12 - this can just cut it in and see that if
398:17 - s do stack widget do current index equal
398:23 - to
398:24 - zero then this is the default one a
398:28 - leave self. stack
398:31 - widget dot current index equal to two
398:36 - that if you are playing from the
398:37 - favorite then we just have to change a
398:39 - few things here
398:42 - so this will
398:45 - be favorite song
398:48 - list and then also fav song list oh
398:54 - sorry I didn't do this earlier sorry I
398:56 - didn't do this
398:59 - earlier so inside the fates now
399:03 - play we know that the rest works so let
399:06 - me Loop it
399:08 - [Music]
399:09 - [Applause]
399:12 - [Music]
399:14 - fast I'm expecting to play the same song
399:16 - again but the background will still
399:17 - still be the same and you can see and
399:20 - even if I go again it will still be the
399:22 - same because the media has not changed
399:25 - but as soon as I go random get to the
399:34 - end shuffled next list index out of
399:37 - range how can the shuffled list index be
399:41 - out of
399:42 - range okay let's play it again and
399:50 - see Shuffle next why are these errors
399:53 - now popping up
399:54 - shold n should be up
400:01 - here it's actually down okay
400:06 - so it says the list index is out of
400:09 - range and yes it is true because this
400:13 - supposed to be favorite list songlist I
400:16 - am very sorry that is there
400:18 - disadvantages of copying and pasting and
400:21 - if this one itself should be favorite
400:24 - song list and I did change this one I
400:27 - didn't change this ones how and why so
400:37 - play I know that the rest works so let
400:39 - me just shle this one now you
400:42 - see and did Shuffle and it change but if
400:45 - I Loop
400:47 - it and then
400:52 - go
400:57 - I is playing the same song
400:58 - but uh the background did not change
401:02 - okay so that is so so so great but
401:05 - there's one thing that I forgot to do
401:08 - this app
401:09 - works and but there's one thing that we
401:11 - just forgot to do that can cost us
401:14 - especially if we package this app and
401:16 - send it to someone
401:19 - else what will happen now if I
401:21 - intentionally click on this database and
401:26 - then delete that particular
401:31 - folder
401:32 - here let me delete it so everything is
401:36 - gone everything is gone now let me run
401:38 - the
401:42 - app is is unable to connect unable to
401:46 - open
401:47 - database so as a very good practice one
401:50 - of the best things that we can do is to
401:53 - create this that with code inside the
401:56 - App instead of creating it manually like
401:58 - I did at first so that one let me see it
402:01 - will come up here it will not be a class
402:03 - method it's just simple function so that
402:07 - will be defined let's call it
402:10 - create thebore
402:14 - D
402:16 - and we can see that OS do make not make
402:21 - the make this and what is the name of
402:25 - the directory you want to make it's just
402:26 - inside that place just in that
402:29 - particular directory so just say
402:33 - DBS and then if we make it this way and
402:38 - run it it will work for the first time
402:39 - we not get error I think so it says is
402:42 - still unable to open database file and
402:46 - that is because even though we have
402:47 - created this function it's of no use to
402:49 - us so what we can do is now come to the
402:53 - database stuff and then call the create
402:56 - the the BD this function up here so that
403:00 - be it will be created when the app first
403:02 - runs so now let's run it and
403:06 - see and then our app runs successfully
403:08 - now we come back you see that the the
403:10 - DBS has been created and the database
403:12 - inside has been created if you inspect
403:14 - it you see that it is only our default
403:17 - favorite table that is inside and
403:20 - nothing more yeah so that one also works
403:22 - like we expected
403:24 - let's come back and now let me run it up
403:28 - again and now we can we get an error
403:31 - that says that cannot create a file when
403:33 - that file already exists so what we need
403:36 - to do now is to just add one one
403:39 - parameter here then says that exists
403:42 - okay and then ISS true when you put this
403:46 - thing here that means that if it exist
403:47 - just skip it if it doesn't exist create
403:52 - it so just run it
403:54 - now and then we don't get into any error
403:57 - our favorites are all gone but we know
404:00 - that our things work let's create two
404:02 - playlist one for Dev and one
404:07 - for CS one
404:10 - for I think two two two is okay so let's
404:13 - come back to song list add our songs our
404:16 - songs are not that many but we try and
404:17 - spread them to the database we know for
404:20 - sure that all these are functionalities
404:22 - work so I'll just click and
404:26 - play just add it to my favorites and
404:30 - then add a very happy cre Mouse to to my
404:33 - favorite I mean adding everything to my
404:38 - [Music]
404:40 - favorite and is here and everything is
404:43 - now working out clearly and working out
404:45 - well for me okay
404:51 - so let's add them to playlist also I
404:54 - want to add everything here to a
404:58 - playlist so add all to playlist save all
405:01 - to
405:01 - playlist I'll add it to Cs and then okay
405:06 - inside
405:07 - CS now I see that all of them have been
405:10 - added here but the de should be
405:14 - empty because there's no song in there
405:16 - so let's just not make it feel lonely
405:19 - let's add this one that is playing to
405:22 - playlist to death
405:24 - [Music]
405:26 - and then that one too also works for
405:28 - there so we know that these ones are
405:31 - working we can remove the dep
405:34 - unfortunately remove all which we will
405:36 - not try and the favores Also let's just
405:40 - add this one make it redundant try and
405:43 - remove it remove all I will not even try
405:46 - that one also
405:48 - so our app is now
405:51 - working and as we expected it to be and
405:55 - this is so so great I hope you have
405:57 - learned a lot along the way I hope you
406:00 - have learned a lot along the way if you
406:02 - do not understand anything uh you can
