00:06 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:08 - with jesse i'm jesse and today we're
00:11 - going to pick up right where we left off
00:13 - last week in the last stream
00:15 - and we're getting free code cam
00:18 - to run locally
00:20 - so when i say free code camp i mean
00:23 - the
00:24 - the lessons the curriculum on
00:26 - freecodecam.org
00:28 - so if you didn't see the last stream
00:30 - here's a quick recap of what we're
00:31 - trying to do
00:34 - we want to make
00:36 - we want to add some react native lessons
00:39 - so gwen faraday has created a react
00:43 - native
00:45 - curriculum
00:46 - and
00:48 - we want to get that running in the
00:49 - browser
00:51 - all right so react native does not run
00:53 - in the browser
00:56 - you know just as is but we can use react
00:58 - native web to make it run in the browser
01:01 - so step one is
01:03 - getting it
01:05 - getting the curriculum to run locally
01:08 - which we started last time
01:10 - so we'll finish that up this time
01:12 - hopefully
01:13 - and
01:14 - we'll get that running
01:16 - so
01:17 - hold on one second
01:25 - all right
01:28 - i forgot to get my music on
01:30 - i
01:31 - usually stream with music in the
01:34 - background because
01:40 - all right can y'all hear me
01:42 - everything cut out for a second i don't
01:45 - know what happened
01:47 - i think i'm back uh
01:49 - all right
01:50 - that was weird there's something with my
01:52 - internet
01:54 - i don't know
01:56 - all right
01:57 - but anyway i like to play music in the
01:59 - background and then that way i i speak a
02:01 - little bit louder otherwise i tend to be
02:04 - kind of a low
02:05 - low kind of speaker so
02:08 - i want to make sure y'all can hear me
02:12 - okay so i'm gonna get
02:17 - some music playing in the background
02:26 - all right i have a lot of stuff in the
02:28 - chat right now
02:29 - so
02:32 - i'm going to
02:34 - check on the chat in about uh 25 minutes
02:37 - or so
02:38 - uh and then
02:43 - oh yeah there's a lot of stuff so i'm
02:44 - just gonna say hey to everybody and then
02:46 - i'm gonna check on the chat about 25
02:48 - minutes
02:50 - and
02:52 - i also want to let everybody know that i
02:54 - probably won't be streaming
02:56 - next week
02:58 - so probably won't have another stream
03:00 - until the week after
03:01 - so i'm gonna be in chicago at the end of
03:04 - the week for the react loop conference
03:05 - so anybody in chicago
03:07 - um
03:09 - let me know
03:10 - i have a very limited time in chicago
03:12 - i'll be there thursday
03:15 - and then just in the morning on friday
03:16 - and then i'm going to fly back
03:18 - so if i know anybody in chicago and you
03:21 - want to hang out let me know quickly and
03:23 - then maybe we can hang out on thursday
03:26 - and then after that i'm going to come
03:28 - back on friday afternoon and then drive
03:32 - to the beach with my family
03:34 - so i'll be going all week with them
03:37 - and i'm not going to try to stream
03:39 - from the beach
03:43 - okay
03:46 - all right so let's see
03:49 - it's been a week since we worked on this
03:51 - so
03:53 - i need to get up to date on this
03:55 - all right so the last thing that we
03:57 - were working
03:58 - on was trying to get to run
04:02 - locally
04:04 - and that was our
04:05 - that was kind of our challenge right
04:08 - uh also you know let me get a pomodoro
04:10 - clock running
04:14 - and
04:17 - let's do this
04:20 - trying to see where the best place to
04:21 - run this
04:26 - is thought i had one up already but
04:31 - i guess not
04:33 - pomodoro clock is just gonna be like a
04:35 - 25 minute timer
04:42 - okay
04:49 - all right so this is
04:53 - our package json so here these are the
04:55 - uh
04:56 - kind of like the commands that we have
04:58 - we're working with right now
05:00 - see challenges
05:03 - all right so we're going to want to see
05:04 - the challenges
05:06 - but first we actually need to i believe
05:09 - we need to do is get this running
05:12 - so let's check out our
05:16 - let me let me pull over a window here
05:19 - uh browser window
05:26 - i thought i had one going but
05:28 - from the last time i didn't close
05:30 - anything from the last time but you know
05:32 - how it is when you have too many windows
05:33 - open it's easier just open a new one
05:35 - then then define the one you have open
05:38 - all right so
05:40 - we're gonna go to github's free code
05:42 - camp
05:55 - and let's check out the
05:58 - contributing guide
06:06 - uh if you're going to do an open source
06:09 - project
06:12 - sometimes you'll find there's a
06:14 - contributing.md
06:16 - and always make sure you read that you
06:18 - have a much better chance of getting
06:20 - your pull request actually merged if you
06:23 - follow the instructions
06:30 - let's see
06:32 - there we go
06:38 - all right so we've done
06:40 - a lot of this stuff
06:46 - yes we've done this we've done this
07:14 - oh interesting okay so they recommend
07:16 - using docker
07:20 - i do not remember seeing that last time
07:23 - um
07:25 - so they
07:28 - i don't
07:29 - think i have docker installed on this
07:31 - machine
07:33 - so docker is uh like a container system
07:49 - since we already started with
07:53 - the local build stuff
07:55 - i think we'll just go on with that maybe
07:57 - if i have time i'll check out the docker
07:59 - thing and maybe we'll switch to that but
08:01 - for now
08:03 - i
08:04 - think this is probably
08:10 - probably the best way to go
08:28 - okay so we've done this
08:30 - environment variable thing
08:32 - let's see we're not on the docker build
08:36 - okay so that's the docker build we don't
08:38 - want that
08:52 - all above needs to be run only the first
08:54 - time you set up the local dev
08:56 - environment
09:06 - what is
09:07 - ci is let's um
09:11 - i do not believe we ran
09:13 - a ci on npm
09:16 - so let's do that
09:28 - also i believe we found that there's
09:30 - kind of a different structure here
09:34 - um so there's lerna was being used
09:38 - so we might
09:40 - and this is basically
09:43 - on the main branch there's a different
09:45 - structure to the project than on this
09:47 - branch the react native challenges
09:49 - branch
09:51 - so
09:54 - we're going to have to
09:58 - maybe do it a little bit differently
10:00 - so
10:03 - we'll see if we can't get this working
10:05 - we'll see
10:10 - lerna basically um
10:13 - lets you have kind of a structure where
10:14 - you you have um
10:16 - like your main project and a package
10:18 - json at the main level and then you have
10:21 - folders within that that also have their
10:24 - own package jsons and it ties them all
10:27 - together
10:28 - uh i wonder if i can see an example okay
10:30 - so like this is our main package json
10:34 - right
10:36 - and
10:39 - let's see if we have
10:40 - another one here
10:46 - yeah so then we have this this sub
10:49 - package here
10:55 - with its own set of stuff
10:57 - right so that's
10:59 - that's uh l-e-r-n-a is lerna so you
11:02 - could check it out if you want
11:05 - uh i haven't used it for a project but i
11:08 - was considering it for a project that
11:09 - i'm working on
11:14 - hopefully i know enough about it that we
11:16 - can get through this otherwise with to
11:18 - do a little more research
11:20 - all right let's go back to our docs
11:22 - our contributing documentation
11:28 - hey and i think i found the
11:31 - one i was originally looking at
11:33 - okay
11:34 - um on windows
11:39 - let's see we need to start mongodb in a
11:42 - separate terminal
11:53 - okay so let's try to run this
11:57 - i don't remember which one we installed
11:59 - all right let's let's check out our
12:02 - program files mongodb server 3.6 let's
12:05 - see which one we did all right it opened
12:07 - on another window
12:08 - let me just check this out
12:19 - see
12:20 - program files mongodb
12:23 - server all right we have 4.0
12:26 - okay
12:28 - so we should be able to just
12:31 - copy this
12:34 - and we'll run this in
12:35 - [Music]
12:37 - we'll just run this
12:39 - on another little spot
12:41 - another terminal here
12:48 - i believe that was the command let me
12:49 - double check that though
12:53 - mongod that's that's what we wanted i
12:56 - think we had some issues with commands
12:58 - not working so
12:59 - we'll see if this works
13:02 - oops nope that's
13:05 - all not so that's not it
13:08 - uh
13:09 - let's see
13:15 - how did we get that working last time
13:24 - let's see
13:25 - um
13:26 - in the comments it says you can add that
13:28 - path to your environment variables and
13:30 - just run it typing mongod in the
13:32 - terminal
13:38 - oh okay
13:44 - all right that's cool that works um
13:51 - ratted to your environment variables
13:54 - oh or i can cd into that folder and just
13:57 - run it from there you know what that's
13:59 - how we
14:00 - that's how we got it last time thank you
14:02 - brandon so brandon's saying that's where
14:04 - he got stuck last time and that's what i
14:05 - just realized awesome
14:07 - okay so let's
14:09 - let's get that working i'm just gonna
14:11 - cd out of here
14:14 - um let's see if i can get this
14:20 - whoa
14:30 - oops
14:41 - there we go
15:01 - what was it server yeah
15:06 - 4.0
15:07 - and then i think it was ben after that
15:10 - was that
15:10 - it yeah ben
15:17 - okay there we go
15:21 - now we can run this
15:27 - whoops i just need to run it
15:34 - all right i'm checking i'm checking the
15:37 - memory says i think adding it to the
15:38 - environment was a better choice to avoid
15:40 - cd every time yeah i think you're
15:42 - absolutely right i'm just doing it this
15:44 - way
15:45 - so that we can try to get it started
15:46 - quickly
15:47 - um but yeah you're right i think there's
15:49 - some setup that
15:52 - um that should happen there georgette
15:56 - says it looks like a live stream on how
15:57 - to debug yeah that's pretty much what
15:59 - this ends up being most of the time we
16:02 - actually get stuff done too but
16:04 - um especially when we're starting a
16:05 - project or doing something new
16:08 - it does end up being a lot of debugging
16:11 - all right um
16:12 - let's see
16:14 - so we need to run the
16:17 - dot exe
16:24 - um
16:25 - so let's see
16:28 - okay mommy's giving me the command here
16:30 - so
16:34 - let's go
16:44 - there we go
16:46 - all right cool let's see
16:49 - what happened here
16:59 - i'm gonna go starting
17:18 - on the localhost
17:34 - all right cool so it looks like it
17:35 - worked
17:44 - at me reminding me you're on windows
17:46 - jesse i know i know i normally develop
17:48 - on a mac so uh but i stream from uh pc
17:52 - so
17:53 - uh
17:54 - it's when it
17:55 - there's definitely some differences that
17:57 - i need to get used to
17:59 - so i probably only use a pc
18:02 - i don't know like
18:03 - five percent of the time that i'm on a
18:06 - computer probably less uh so
18:09 - apollo is used for being a little rusty
18:11 - for the pc
18:13 - okay so i think we have this working
18:16 - and so let's see if we can go on to the
18:18 - next step which is
18:20 - i believe seeding the database
18:25 - yep
18:26 - so we'll do npm run
18:29 - seed
18:44 - okay cool that that looks like
18:47 - it's working
18:50 - she completed
18:58 - inserted 200 new articles awesome okay
19:02 - very cool
19:08 - and you should be able to type npm run
19:11 - develop
19:14 - and that'll do everything so i'm hoping
19:16 - that this part is all the same
19:19 - on this uh branch
19:22 - and we'll find out in a second
19:31 - okay
19:35 - i'm just
19:37 - i'm i'm not used to switching
19:40 - between uh windows on
19:42 - a pc
19:43 - on a mac like there's really cool
19:45 - shortcuts to just flip around different
19:47 - like desktops so
19:50 - sorry i'm so slow
19:59 - oh it's doing stuff
20:10 - oh yeah we're using gatsby i forgot if
20:13 - your code camp was built with gatsby
20:25 - all right so we're getting a bunch of
20:27 - messages but nothing that's like
20:30 - oh here we go graphql error
20:33 - challenge us
20:38 - okay so we did actually get an error
20:40 - here
20:48 - hmm
21:01 - interesting
21:03 - all right let's go to our
21:06 - package.json
21:08 - and see if some if it's different
21:17 - all right i believe the seed command is
21:20 - different
21:25 - but i mean not the command just like the
21:27 - the script so the name of the script
21:34 - looks like develops the same
21:56 - interesting let's try
22:00 - oh okay
22:01 - in the chat it looks like a few you're
22:03 - telling me to do alt tab to change the
22:06 - windows let's see
22:10 - oh okay cool and it brings up all my
22:12 - windows
22:13 - awesome
22:15 - it's bringing them up on another screen
22:17 - but like
22:19 - oh that's really cool
22:24 - okay
22:28 - all right let's see
22:29 - so we typed in
22:33 - i'm going to try to force myself to use
22:34 - this
22:37 - alt tab
22:46 - dang it i must not have done it right
22:55 - all right i need to get
22:57 - the hang of this okay
22:59 - so we
23:00 - ran
23:03 - npm run develop
23:07 - but did we ever run
23:14 - yeah we didn't run any type of
23:19 - basically what i'm looking at are these
23:21 - commands
23:23 - here like this
23:25 - this stuff which is um
23:29 - the learner stuff
23:34 - so i think that's what i want to run is
23:37 - this
23:40 - so there's a
23:44 - free bootstrap
23:48 - post install
23:51 - okay
23:58 - let's see
24:08 - all right i'm gonna run some of these
24:10 - i'm not 100 sure
24:12 - that
24:15 - these are what i need to run but
24:18 - let's see
24:25 - i lost my terminals
24:27 - there we go
24:38 - i'm going to cancel
24:40 - wait is that how it works here
24:44 - maybe
24:46 - i could
24:55 - no how am i supposed to get out here
25:00 - there we go it just took a while to kill
25:02 - them all
25:06 - that's such a violent command right to
25:08 - kill the processes
25:10 - could you say like
25:11 - stop them
25:13 - shut them down
25:17 - okay
25:20 - i got about four minutes until i'm gonna
25:22 - go to the chat and answer some questions
25:23 - so if you're
25:25 - if you've been waiting for me to read
25:26 - your comment just hang in there almost
25:28 - there
25:29 - all right so
25:30 - what i want to try to run is this
25:33 - pre-bootstrap
25:35 - bootstrap and then
25:37 - i guess i can do
25:41 - preboot strap and post install
25:45 - although it seems like
25:51 - it seems like this probably should have
25:52 - run
25:53 - already after we did
25:56 - an npm install
26:00 - but i want to make sure that it it
26:02 - actually ran
26:15 - okay
26:16 - thank you for the uh shortcut for the
26:19 - terminal who did that um
26:22 - so
26:24 - uh so rob
26:26 - sorry if i'm mispronouncing your name
26:28 - but thank you for the the command there
26:33 - okay
26:36 - all right so let's try
26:40 - um
26:43 - npm
26:45 - run
26:47 - what are we gonna do pre
26:50 - bootstrap
26:54 - and this is gonna do the ensure
26:56 - environment
27:00 - okay like i said this stuff may have run
27:02 - already and i just didn't catch it
27:12 - all right now
27:13 - from what i know about learner let's see
27:16 - similar game through shop10
27:18 - packages all right i kind of think that
27:21 - this stuff ran already
27:25 - and
27:29 - now let's
27:31 - try
27:34 - develop
27:46 - all right so i'm kind of expecting we're
27:48 - gonna get the same
27:50 - thing the same errors we did before
27:52 - but i just wanted to try it out
27:58 - just in case oh now we're getting the
28:01 - same thing this graphql error unknown
28:03 - field challenge node
28:04 - on type query
28:11 - on news article node
28:36 - hmm
28:52 - all right so we're still having those
28:53 - graphql issues
28:59 - we did the seed right
29:01 - we ran the seed command
29:09 - when does this start develop
29:13 - so develop
29:15 - okay so the develop command does run
29:18 - start develop okay and it looks like
29:22 - an ensure environment start to build up
29:26 - okay so this already runs
29:33 - and we ran seed
29:51 - okay
29:52 - i want to
29:53 - see what we ran
29:55 - okay so we did do seeds so that should
29:58 - have seeded
29:59 - challenges and news
30:08 - we do so this command here that this
30:10 - seed and then
30:11 - the little asterisk up here that means
30:14 - it'll run
30:15 - all the commands
30:17 - that
30:18 - have you know seed colon so it should
30:21 - have seeded both
30:30 - okay
30:31 - i think my timer yeah my timer's up i
30:34 - didn't get a notification so
30:38 - unless i just missed it but anyway let's
30:40 - let's go
30:42 - to the questions and then hopefully
30:45 - one of us has some idea where to go next
30:47 - because we keep hitting this graphql
30:49 - error
30:55 - all right i'm going to scroll off to the
30:57 - top try to get through as many questions
30:59 - as i can
31:05 - let's see
31:09 - all right so i have a few people asking
31:11 - me what this is about
31:12 - um
31:14 - i explained it at the beginning uh and
31:16 - then on the last stream that i did i
31:19 - also explained a lot more
31:22 - so i'm gonna just say like refer back to
31:24 - the beginning
31:27 - uh gabriel says what is what is the code
31:30 - camp all about um free code camp is
31:36 - a non-profit organization that helps
31:38 - people learn how to code for free it has
31:40 - a lot of things so it has
31:42 - the the lessons on freecodecamp.org that
31:45 - are like two coding tutorials
31:48 - um it has a bunch of uh blog posts a
31:52 - youtube channel a podcast
31:54 - a whole like wiki site
31:57 - uh a forum
31:58 - so i'm probably missing out on stuff but
32:01 - there's just a ton of resources for
32:03 - people to learn how to code all of it is
32:04 - completely free
32:08 - okay
32:11 - there's a ton of stuff in the chat so
32:13 - i'm trying to scroll through quickly
32:14 - apologies if i miss your question
32:18 - rusty asks what language is it we're
32:20 - going to be using javascript
32:34 - let's see
32:47 - all right uh georgette says hey jesse do
32:50 - you think you can create a series in
32:51 - which you create an app with react
32:53 - native
32:54 - so actually the the last project that we
32:57 - worked on that we're not finished yet is
33:00 - a react native app so we're gonna go
33:02 - back to that once we get done with this
33:05 - uh so that'll be
33:07 - project seven
33:09 - so you can go back and look at all the
33:11 - project seven videos on free code camp
33:14 - uh just just my videos the live coding
33:16 - with jesse stuff
33:18 - to get an idea of
33:20 - how you would do a react native app
33:27 - uh
33:28 - prince the boss says do you use pomodoro
33:30 - to get yourself into the flow state when
33:32 - you start
33:33 - yes i do try to use pomodoro when i can
33:37 - at my my normal job so i'm a software
33:39 - engineer at dick's sporting goods
33:43 - we do a lot of pair programming it's
33:45 - kind of harder to get in the flow state
33:47 - when you pay a program
33:50 - but
33:51 - when i can i do
33:53 - try to get in that flow state and i
33:56 - do use pomodoro technique
33:59 - but it's not always possible when you're
34:00 - pair programming
34:04 - meltdown is asking for a shout out hey
34:06 - meltdown
34:13 - uh gregory says wondering is there any
34:15 - free code campers in georgia hey any
34:17 - free code campers in georgia
34:21 - give a shout in the chat or in the
34:22 - comments
34:38 - uh let's see
34:40 - uh ready and says can i fork yeah yeah
34:42 - for sure you can fork this repo um
34:45 - anybody can contribute to the free code
34:47 - camp repo it's not like uh
34:50 - um
34:51 - there's no prerequisites or anything
34:53 - well i guess you have to be smart enough
34:54 - to get it running which
34:56 - evidently i'm not there yet but i'm
34:58 - gonna get there
35:07 - and then he says hello jesse how are you
35:09 - doing
35:10 - uh hey i'm
35:12 - guess i'm doing all right um
35:16 - pretty busy this week getting ready for
35:17 - the conference and um
35:20 - uh for vacation and everything but other
35:22 - than that i'm doing all right thanks for
35:23 - asking
35:28 - uh goulet says do you have save
35:30 - recordings of your teaching javascript
35:32 - and html
35:34 - uh yeah so all my
35:36 - live streams are recorded
35:38 - and they're saved
35:40 - on here on the free code camp channel
35:42 - just search for
35:43 - live coding with jesse or check out the
35:49 - sorry check out the live coding with
35:51 - jesse playlist
35:52 - you can also check out my youtube
35:54 - channel the links in the description
35:56 - i have some tutorial videos there and
35:59 - also some live streams there
36:01 - and i'm gonna try to put out a video
36:04 - before i go on go to my conference or
36:06 - before i go to vacation on vacation um
36:10 - this next week um so i haven't decided
36:14 - exactly what the topic will be but i'd
36:15 - like to do another kind of short
36:17 - tutorial video
36:19 - since i haven't done one for a while
36:24 - okay
36:33 - i didn't get through everything
36:40 - so i'm going to mark down the time stamp
36:42 - where i left off so i can go right back
36:44 - to it
36:53 - he says i think if you empty your cash
36:55 - and try again the arrow will go
36:58 - okay
37:00 - um
37:05 - let's see
37:09 - all right that's where the shot
37:11 - should you empty
37:16 - how am i supposed to empty my cash
37:18 - remember this is a silly question but
37:21 - um
37:27 - let me know
37:29 - i'm not sure
37:34 - uh who's
37:36 - who's scifi
37:39 - says looks like you're really tired
37:42 - i'm tired it's it's uh it's not that
37:44 - early here it's 7 42 a.m
37:47 - um so it's not super early but
37:50 - i am a little tired
37:58 - okay
37:59 - um somebody asked me how many people are
38:01 - watching right now that's a good
38:03 - question i didn't really check uh 123
38:06 - people right now
38:08 - so that's kind of cool
38:15 - that's that's a decent amount of people
38:25 - all right lettuces do a clean build
38:29 - all
38:30 - right let's get this out of here we
38:33 - don't need to
38:44 - see all right i'm gonna hide this on the
38:47 - side just for a second here because
38:50 - we don't really need it also going to
38:54 - give us some more space here
39:02 - okay
39:25 - everybody
39:26 - keep getting comments about why is it so
39:28 - dark down here it's dark right now
39:30 - because
39:31 - well number one it's it's dark outside
39:33 - because it's raining
39:34 - yes it's very cloudy
39:36 - i'm also in a basement
39:39 - so
39:40 - it's pretty it's pretty dark and um
39:43 - i just left the lights off because
39:45 - there's less glare on the screen
39:48 - it's okay
39:59 - all right
40:01 - so i guess we could try
40:05 - oops
40:11 - oh i know what i wanted to do
40:13 - um
40:15 - so
40:17 - we are running on a
40:20 - on a fork on a different branch
40:23 - so
40:24 - it may be that
40:26 - there are different instructions
40:31 - so let's go
40:38 - we go
40:41 - so we're gonna go to gwen faraday's
40:44 - uh repo
40:46 - and
40:47 - [Music]
40:49 - we're gonna
40:50 - there we go we're gonna go to her branch
40:53 - and see if
40:56 - nah i don't think so
41:01 - i was hoping that there are updates to
41:03 - the contributing file but
41:08 - i don't
41:08 - think there is
41:15 - actually we would want this file right
41:19 - set up free code camp locally
41:40 - i'm just trying to see if there's a
41:41 - difference here or i don't think there
41:43 - is
41:49 - no definitely not
41:50 - okay
42:01 - i probably should just open the local
42:02 - host just to
42:04 - yeah just to verify
42:06 - that it's not going to run
42:20 - oh okay so we got some more so hammy
42:22 - says um
42:25 - that's what i found on github's gatsby
42:27 - page the error was found before you can
42:29 - search for the error message on google
42:31 - and you'll find the steps okay cool
42:34 - thanks so much
42:36 - so
42:37 - let's just google that error
42:40 - um
42:42 - i'm not sure which
42:47 - which era
42:52 - i'm gonna feel
43:09 - let's just grab this one
43:13 - all right
43:14 - well let me see we could try npm cash
43:16 - clean
43:22 - whoa
43:24 - okay so feels encryption shoes
43:27 - interesting
43:40 - all right
43:47 - i can force this command if i want to
43:50 - just do that
44:01 - i love it you're using force i sure hope
44:03 - you know what you're doing
44:04 - all right cool
44:13 - and i believe the command that they said
44:16 - was
44:31 - all right so let's try that also let's
44:35 - look up
44:36 - i want to go back to the free code cam
44:38 - thing
44:39 - and i want to try to look up
44:42 - this error
44:45 - uh
44:51 - yeah i didn't think that
44:54 - this error would come up specifically
45:03 - usb issues
45:13 - all right yeah this was like this same
45:15 - error
45:34 - no
45:35 - yeah i don't think that's it
45:41 - all right cool
45:47 - so let's try this now
45:52 - develop that's it
46:05 - oops i'm used to using yarn
46:09 - and you don't have to type run with
46:12 - that
46:30 - hmm
46:36 - okay same thing
46:48 - let's see i'm checking the chat here to
46:50 - see
46:51 - what advice
46:57 - everybody has
47:13 - all right it looks like
47:24 - all right looks like we're still going
47:25 - with we need to look up the air
47:33 - let's see
47:42 - on first builds okay
47:48 - accessible after a second run
48:06 - all right
48:09 - and mommy said npm cash clear works for
48:11 - me works with no error for me
48:14 - hmm
48:22 - okay
48:24 - that was interesting
48:26 - i want to run this again
48:28 - that
48:28 - the other person there that had that
48:30 - error
48:31 - um
48:37 - oops
48:45 - there we go
48:49 - said when they ran it the second time it
48:51 - worked now we already tried twice in a
48:52 - row so i'm not really
48:54 - hopeful that this will work but it's
48:56 - good shot i mean that's an easy fix if
48:59 - it works
49:00 - you graphical error
49:03 - unknown field
49:21 - well it doesn't look like we're not
49:22 - alone in this
49:24 - but
49:29 - that also means there'll be a lot of
49:30 - stuff we need to go through expect
49:32 - there's a
49:33 - step shooting process
49:37 - the update schema steps should be
49:39 - processed without errors
49:44 - all right that that looks
49:45 - very close to what we have
49:48 - in terms of what the errors
49:52 - directory is clear i'm able to reproduce
49:54 - this and getting it on the first run
49:56 - i'm also seeing this air
49:58 - regardless cash cleared
50:22 - that's
50:28 - not really giving us a solution
50:32 - all right let's go back to the chat see
50:34 - what you all have to
50:39 - all think what you have to say
50:48 - uh think verse says what repo are you
50:50 - using for the fork good question
50:52 - um i'm using
50:56 - so let's grow up so this one so um
50:59 - gwen faraday's
51:01 - um
51:02 - fork
51:03 - of free code camp
51:06 - so it's not directly from free code camp
51:08 - it's it's off of her fork the reason i'm
51:10 - using her fork is because she has um
51:13 - react native lessons on there
51:15 - uh so that's what we need to work with
51:31 - okay
51:33 - fernando says are you missing a module
51:38 - i'm not sure because let's see
51:40 - successful after second run after
51:42 - clearing the cash
51:46 - all right mommy says successful after a
51:48 - second we run after clearing the cash
51:50 - see that's not
51:54 - me i'm so glad you got a success but i'm
51:56 - not getting a success here
51:58 - um
52:00 - so we did clear the cash
52:05 - but we're not getting
52:10 - we're not getting any success here
52:20 - now it is it's possible that there's
52:22 - some difference because of this
52:24 - particular branch on this fork
52:27 - and
52:28 - maybe i just need to talk to gwen and
52:30 - see
52:34 - after second second time after clearing
52:36 - cash i mean i guess we could try to
52:38 - clear
52:40 - try to do a clear again
52:56 - okay
53:18 - okay so this is
53:22 - just the same one
53:27 - keep saying that
53:29 - uh they saw a ghost behind me
53:31 - um
53:33 - as
53:37 - so long as the ghost
53:39 - helps me debug this i'm okay with that
53:42 - um
53:51 - all right yeah this is the one we just
53:53 - turned every time the catastrophe is
53:55 - cleared
54:06 - all right let's clear
54:20 - all right let's clear this
54:29 - and uh me are you using the same
54:33 - fork and branch that i am
54:52 - okay i'm at me saying the cause of the
54:53 - air is gatsby and not graphql that's
54:55 - what i understood don't know
54:58 - all right
55:00 - let's see
55:02 - you know what let's run
55:11 - learner
55:13 - i actually think all that runs
55:22 - so there's definitely a difference so i
55:24 - believe all this stuff with lerna is not
55:26 - present in the main free code camp
55:29 - uh branch
55:32 - and the documentation we're running off
55:34 - of is based off of that
55:36 - maybe that's where the difference is
55:38 - coming in
55:56 - okay
55:59 - the only other thing i can think of is
56:01 - clearing the cache and completely
56:04 - removing
56:05 - um all the node files
56:07 - but it looks like it's
56:09 - remove existing node modules before
56:11 - install so it says it's doing that
56:22 - let's try this out now
56:40 - okay cannot read property minimum level
56:42 - of undefined
56:53 - all right i'm going to take a look at
56:55 - what we're getting here a little bit
56:57 - more closely
57:36 - hmm
57:52 - hmm
58:04 - all right
58:07 - and mimi says you can check can you try
58:09 - using a newer version of gasping graphql
58:12 - john hanson says i recently had a
58:14 - similar issue turned out to be windows
58:15 - 10 path issue i cleaned up path
58:17 - variables and ran a node repair fix it
58:19 - for me oh okay um
58:23 - john could you
58:25 - walk me through that then
58:27 - so this is interesting so uh like i
58:29 - mentioned before i don't normally
58:30 - develop on uh windows so
58:34 - maybe this is some sort of windows thing
58:36 - hammy are you on a pc2
58:48 - i'm also going to run this just one more
58:50 - time since this would be the second time
58:52 - after clearing the cache again which
58:55 - worked before
58:57 - for uh for hammy
59:04 - and
59:06 - i got about three minutes before the
59:08 - next timer goes off and then i'm gonna
59:09 - go back and answer some more questions
59:12 - i'd love to get something running so
59:15 - so far
59:16 - we got
59:18 -  running which we didn't get
59:20 - running last time i don't think so we
59:22 - had one small win
59:35 - all right so that did not work
59:48 - all right so john's saying npm config
59:51 - path prefix
59:54 - should show the path
60:25 - john says open environment variables in
60:29 - windows
60:41 - i'm going to open environment variables
60:43 - i'm going to find this
60:51 - i need to like is there a search on
60:54 - windows
61:01 - where can i search for stuff on windows
61:09 - there we go type here to search
61:20 - [Music]
61:27 - oh it opened on another screen let me
61:28 - move this over
61:30 - all right environment vehicles clearing
61:33 - the castles okay me was on ubuntu okay
61:39 - okay make sure your pass system variable
61:41 - includes your node.js path
61:43 - all right
61:48 - environment variables
62:04 - okay
62:32 - okay
62:42 - include your no jazz path
62:50 - i'm guessing
62:52 - is that would that be the right path i'm
62:54 - showing users jesse app data roaming npm
63:14 - in the path on the system variables
63:17 - oh sorry sorry sorry
63:21 - oh okay
63:22 - let's see what we got here
63:28 - okay
63:34 - all right yeah program files node.js is
63:38 - here
63:49 - should i have something separate for
63:52 - npm
64:14 - all right john says the path looks fine
64:16 - for no jazz
64:17 - so i guess it's not a path thing
64:26 - okay
64:32 - i actually wonder
64:37 - now go to add or remove programs
65:00 - all right
65:15 - all right
65:17 - node this is some some legit debugging
65:20 - here
65:22 - debugging windows
65:24 - um
65:25 - all right
65:28 - all right so we found node
65:30 - and we're gonna run
65:33 - run repair
65:47 - modify
65:48 - and repair
65:51 - repair
65:54 - we're going to repair node
66:02 - i hope this works and it's helpful for
66:04 - somebody out there
66:22 - all right while this is happening i'm
66:24 - gonna
66:24 - [Music]
66:25 - read some questions and stuff
66:27 - oh is it finished already
66:30 - huh
66:31 - i guess i'm not going to read questions
66:32 - as well as
66:35 - john instances you may want to reboot
66:37 - the system
66:40 - all right well i'm not going to reboot
66:42 - in the middle of a stream so i might
66:43 - have to wait until the next stream
66:53 - the only other thing i thought of doing
66:55 - was
66:59 - so i could do
67:02 - yarn develop and see if it does anything
67:05 - different
67:09 - and i know it seems weird but like i
67:11 - have had it happen before that a command
67:14 - will work with yarn but not with npm
67:18 - so it's worth it worth a try
67:26 - it looks like no same thing same air
67:51 - all right i'm gonna do that and i'm also
67:52 - gonna do
68:00 - clean out the node module
68:07 - taking out node modules and the package
68:09 - lock json
68:14 - doing like the legit
68:18 - destroy everything
68:24 - whoa
68:27 - let's see
68:34 - let's try this
68:42 - all right so
68:44 - that'll take a little bit and i can
68:47 - go back to the
68:48 - questions now
69:00 - all right so i'm scrolling all the way
69:02 - up to where i left off
69:03 - so hopefully i don't miss anything
69:13 - georgette says why didn't you continue
69:15 - your last episode react native on
69:16 - browser actually this is a continuation
69:19 - of the last episode
69:20 - um
69:23 - this is kind of the first step in that
69:28 - all right cool that took
69:29 - less time than i thought it would
69:31 - um
69:45 - and
70:00 - start the next
70:12 - oh same error
70:26 - may as well run it twice since
70:30 - since the people on uh
70:35 - on github had success trying to run it
70:37 - twice
70:38 - not really that hopeful at this point
70:40 - though
70:42 - uh
70:46 - i don't think we're gonna get this to
70:48 - work during today's stream
70:50 - which is all right
70:52 - uh it may just be that since we did the
70:55 - repair i just need to restart my
70:56 - computer i'm not going to do that
70:58 - obviously because if i do that it's
70:59 - going to cut the stream off
71:02 - so
71:03 - i'll have to do that
71:04 - after the stream
71:06 - and then hopefully it'll work for the
71:08 - next stream
71:10 - also i'll probably reach out to gwen and
71:13 - ask if there's anything special i need
71:15 - to do
71:16 - um since her project is set up
71:18 - differently so let me
71:21 - i want to show you just so that maybe
71:23 - it's a little bit
71:25 - more clear
71:26 - like how this
71:29 - um
71:33 - what i mean by setup differently
71:35 - right so
71:37 - if we look at
71:39 - like the package json for this
71:41 - and then
71:46 - we go to the normal
71:47 - free code cam master branch and look at
71:50 - the package json
71:54 - let's see if it's
71:56 - looks like there's learning here now
71:57 - maybe i had an older version
72:00 - whoa looks like no dependencies
72:07 - actually there's a lot more going on
72:08 - here now
72:17 - i wonder
72:27 - where's the last time
72:32 - six months
72:50 - all right so the last commit to this was
72:52 - on february 10th
72:54 - about this one
72:57 - january 6.
72:59 - it's possible
73:15 - and the last commit on this was three
73:17 - days ago
73:19 - it's entirely possible
73:22 - that
73:25 - there have been some breaking changes
73:30 - and that's why we can't get it working
73:40 - so
73:42 - i wonder
73:49 - i wonder if it would be a better idea
73:51 - and i don't have time to do it today but
73:53 - um
73:54 - it would be a better idea to try to get
73:57 - free code camp running
74:01 - from like it's its latest updates from
74:04 - the main repo just to get it running
74:07 - then we can pull over like let's say one
74:09 - of the challenges that gwen did as a
74:12 - test
74:13 - to try to get that running because as
74:15 - long as we get it running
74:18 - then
74:19 - gwen can incorporate that into what
74:21 - she's doing and then eventually
74:23 - hopefully that can get put into the free
74:26 - code camp curriculum
74:28 - so
74:29 - everybody can learn
74:31 - some basics of react native
74:37 - i am going to try to do a restart
74:39 - on my machine just to see if i get it
74:41 - working if that doesn't work then i
74:42 - think we're going to go with that plan
74:44 - let me know what you all think about
74:45 - that plan so the the backup plan here is
74:50 - clone
74:52 - so fork and clone the main free code
74:54 - camp repo with the latest changes and
74:56 - try to get it running based on that
74:58 - because that's we're using documentation
75:00 - from the latest repo
75:03 - but we're trying to get something to run
75:05 - that hasn't been updated since february
75:07 - 10th
75:08 - so
75:10 - it's entirely possible that that's part
75:13 - of our issue
75:14 - so the the plan is
75:17 - use the main repo next time if we can't
75:19 - get this one to work let me know what
75:21 - you think of that plan if you have a
75:22 - better plan or if there's something i'm
75:24 - missing here that's like obviously a bad
75:27 - idea
75:44 - uh
75:45 - what exactly is gatsby um gatsby is just
75:50 - a
75:52 - i don't know you would just say like uh
75:54 - a tool or something like
75:56 - um
75:58 - to build sites with
76:00 - um
76:02 - with react
76:04 - um
76:04 - i guess i don't know how to explain it
76:08 - more than than that um
76:11 - from what i understand and i haven't
76:14 - read up on gatsby or tried to use it in
76:16 - a long time but you can use markdown
76:20 - um
76:22 - and then that gets changed into
76:25 - like actual like web pages uh so i think
76:27 - a lot of people use gatsby for for blogs
76:32 - and they can write their stuff in
76:33 - markdown
76:49 - all right and uh i'm not going to read
76:51 - all the comments out i'm just kind of
76:54 - going for the questions now because i'm
76:55 - running out of time here so apologies if
76:57 - i'm not reading out your comment i am
76:59 - looking at them i'm just not reading
77:01 - them out loud
77:07 - uh georgette says what does fork mean uh
77:10 - so a fork is if if you go on github to a
77:14 - repo
77:14 - you can fork the repo and that means
77:17 - that it it just takes everything in this
77:19 - repository and it copies it onto your
77:22 - github account
77:24 - so that you can then work on that code
77:28 - without affecting the main repository
77:31 - so usually if you're going to contribute
77:33 - to a repository the process is fork it
77:36 - first then clone your fork
77:39 - so that you can run it locally and make
77:41 - changes
77:42 - and then if you change your fork you'll
77:44 - have the option of then submitting a
77:46 - pull request to the main repository and
77:49 - whoever controls that repository can
77:51 - decide whether or not they want to merge
77:53 - that pull request which means your code
77:55 - will then become part of their code part
77:57 - of the main repository
77:59 - uh i
78:00 - did
78:03 - check out my youtube channel i believe i
78:05 - did some git and github videos that
78:08 - explain this in more depth so
78:11 - um
78:12 - i guess check that out if you need
78:15 - if you want more info about that
78:19 - i think that i did do
78:21 - i have done some live streams where i've
78:23 - done that whole process before
78:26 - i don't remember what the
78:27 - exactly what the titles of those streams
78:29 - are though
78:33 - uh atse says i want to learn programming
78:35 - from you can you please send me your
78:37 - direct contact number future
78:38 - correspondence um i have some links to
78:41 - my social media stuff in the description
78:44 - uh if you want to send me a dm or

80:04 - mimo says basement sleepless dark theme

80:08 - girlfriend
80:10 - or whatsoever this guy is epic hashtag

80:22 - i i don't fit all of that but i am in a
80:24 - basement
80:26 - uh i do have dark theme everything and
80:29 - i'm in a dark room
80:30 - um
80:32 - the sleep sometimes i get sleep
80:34 - sometimes i don't and it's not really
80:35 - about programming it's more about like
80:37 - which kids wake up
80:46 - uh who's his iphone says are you a gamer
80:50 - by the way i don't know a former gamer i
80:52 - don't have a lot of time for for games
80:54 - right now i do like them i just i don't
80:56 - have a lot of time to play
81:16 - um love your video
81:18 - ryhon says love your videos please make
81:20 - a basic tutorial of complete react.js
81:23 - how to use templates
81:25 - um
81:26 - yeah maybe i'll do some basic react.js
81:28 - stuff
81:29 - at some point
81:32 - usually i put the tutorials on my
81:34 - youtube channel uh links in the
81:36 - description to that
81:37 - because i haven't updated that channel
81:39 - in a little while but i'd like to do
81:41 - another video sometime this week for
81:42 - that channel
81:59 - uh says what's a good way to learn
82:01 - a low-level language
82:04 - i don't really know a good way like for
82:06 - me a good way
82:08 - for me to learn anything is i try to
82:10 - find free resources online do the
82:12 - tutorials watch the videos read the
82:14 - documentation
82:17 - um and then if i really want to learn
82:19 - something actually building a project
82:21 - with it is a great way to learn
82:42 - [Music]
82:47 - uh
82:52 - uh randy keller says what kind of fancy
82:54 - typewriter is that
82:59 - very fancy typewriter here
83:03 - uh i lost my place
83:06 - i don't know why i it just get down
83:09 - it moved my scroll all the way down to
83:11 - the end of the chat and so now i lost my
83:14 - place let me see if i can find it again
83:16 - all right i did
83:17 - um
83:19 - georgia
83:23 - there was a question but i think it was
83:25 - directed at somebody else and not at me
83:37 - um do you prefer python or javascript
83:40 - i prefer javascript because i'm better
83:42 - with it i don't have anything against
83:44 - python i've used it before and i kind of
83:46 - like it but i'm definitely better with
83:48 - javascript
83:55 - now georgette says you should rename the
83:57 - live stream as a series of debugging
83:59 - yeah honestly that's all it's been so
84:01 - far
84:02 - we're gonna actually do something at
84:04 - some point but
84:06 - we gotta get the setup down first
84:09 - um
84:12 - i've always wanted these streams to be
84:13 - like a realistic look at what it's like
84:15 - to be a developer or software engineer
84:17 - and realistically a lot of time is spent
84:20 - debugging like things like this happen
84:22 - so
84:23 - that's why i leave stuff in here i don't
84:25 - edit the streams i don't delete streams
84:28 - like
84:28 - because
84:30 - as as weird as it is to have a live
84:32 - stream like this and not actually get
84:34 - very much done like
84:36 - sometimes that's the way it is when you
84:38 - actually
84:39 - um
84:40 - you know working at a company
85:01 - uh okay so i had mentioned my um
85:13 - all right so uh so i noticed somebody
85:15 - put in a derogatory remark
85:18 - i'm assuming it was meant to be
85:19 - derogatory i don't know but i just
85:21 - deleted it so just as a reminder
85:23 - everybody
85:24 - we try to stay positive here
85:26 - so um
85:28 - and georgette thank you for putting that
85:30 - message in about no negativity here so
85:32 - we stay positive
85:34 - uh if i see anything in the chat like
85:36 - i'm just gonna delete it i'm not gonna
85:38 - argue with anybody like
85:40 - so just
85:42 - you know if that's your thing this
85:43 - really maybe isn't
85:45 - you're not gonna have a good time in
85:47 - here uh if you wanna be negative uh
85:50 - there's enough negativity elsewhere in
85:52 - the world and online so
85:54 - uh but here we try to stay positive so
85:56 - just a reminder to everybody
85:58 - uh you know keep it keep it positive
86:02 - um i mentioned the idea of let's just
86:05 - try to go with the main free code camp
86:06 - branch next time uh john i believe in
86:09 - response that says that sounds like a
86:11 - good idea i got some thumbs up for that
86:14 - so i think
86:16 - that's probably what we'll end up doing
86:26 - uh
86:27 - dts says what are skills required uh for
86:29 - a present web developer
86:31 - i mean the the skills that you need to
86:33 - be able to like learn fast on your own
86:36 - because everything changes so quickly
86:40 - so problem solving skills as well
86:44 - now in terms of like technical skills
86:48 - i mean html css javascript
86:51 - for sure
86:52 - you definitely need that for web
86:53 - development anything else on top of that
86:56 - is really going to depend on what the
86:57 - particular project is you know and what
86:59 - your client or your company uses
87:03 - but if you know html css and javascript
87:05 - you're going to have a good foundation
87:07 - to pick up anything else
87:11 - um dale asks if the stream just started
87:13 - or attending uh it's ending now but you
87:15 - can always watch the recordings the
87:17 - recording will be available
87:28 - sweetie sweetie sweaty ass what are you
87:30 - doing right now right now i'm just
87:31 - answering questions in the live chat
87:41 - uh did the body ask for blockchain
87:43 - tutorials
87:45 - uh i did do some
87:46 - blockchain
87:49 - live streams on my youtube channel so
87:52 - the link to my channel is in the
87:53 - description uh you can check that out
87:56 - it was a while ago but i used um
88:00 - solidity to do some like ethereum
88:03 - uh apps
88:05 - so maybe you know you could check that
88:07 - out i'm no expert at it but if you want
88:08 - to kind of see what it's like just you
88:10 - know check it out
88:21 - all right cool uh so i got through all
88:22 - the questions like i said i did read
