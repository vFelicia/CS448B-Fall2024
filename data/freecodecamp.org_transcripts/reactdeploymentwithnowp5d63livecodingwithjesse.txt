00:03 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:06 - with jesse i'm jesse
00:08 - and today we're going to deploy a test
00:11 - version of our react project
00:15 - using now
00:16 - which is made by zeit and that's the
00:18 - same company that makes
00:21 - uh next js which is what we're using uh
00:25 - for our react site as well
00:29 - i'm going to go through the whole
00:30 - process we're going to start out
00:32 - by
00:33 - creating a subdomain
00:35 - with one of our urls
00:37 - pointing the subdomain
00:39 - to the proper place we're going to do it
00:41 - with a c name
00:43 - so there's a few different ways that you
00:44 - can do this and oh
00:47 - i'll get you all the links to the
00:50 - documentation
00:51 - uh that lays out i think there's three
00:53 - different ways we can do this we're
00:54 - going to use this the c name way
00:57 - which is
00:59 - is good if you
01:02 - don't want to use their name servers the
01:04 - site name servers which in this case we
01:06 - we don't
01:08 - want to use them so
01:11 - this will be
01:13 - almost like a test run for when we
01:15 - deploy this for real uh on our main
01:17 - domain it'll be slightly different when
01:19 - we do it
01:21 - for the
01:22 - you know the
01:24 - root domain
01:26 - but only only very very slightly
01:29 - uh
01:30 - just
01:32 - let's see
01:35 - just to catch everyone up
01:39 - we um
01:41 - let's see
01:44 - we're pretty much
01:45 - in terms of design the site is it's
01:49 - pretty much done there's a few like
01:51 - little tweaks here and there that i'd
01:52 - like to get to but the big thing that
01:54 - we've been working on and that i've been
01:56 - working on when i'm not streaming is
01:57 - just getting data moved over
02:00 - uh from our old server to our new server
02:04 - from an old database to a new database
02:05 - and then
02:07 - making sure that that data
02:10 - is able to get into react properly and
02:13 - that the urls match up
02:16 - with what the old site has so that's
02:19 - i don't know i feel like i'm doing the
02:20 - same thing every day with this site but
02:23 - i mean there's just a lot there's a lot
02:24 - of data to handle so
02:27 - you know that's how it is
02:28 - so not really fun to do all that but but
02:32 - necessary
02:35 - so i really do i want to get this test
02:37 - site up i want you all to be able to
02:39 - have a url you can go to at any time to
02:41 - check it out and i want you know other
02:44 - users here to be able to check it out
02:45 - and start pointing out to me things that
02:47 - aren't working because we're at
02:50 - almost exactly a month until the launch
02:53 - date
02:54 - uh so i definitely want to give as much
02:56 - time as possible for uh for testing
02:59 - not just for me to test but for other
03:01 - people to test
03:05 - all right
03:06 - okay we're starting to get a few more
03:09 - uh viewers
03:11 - so i guess we'll start up i do want to
03:13 - mention though
03:15 - uh next week
03:16 - next tuesday i will be at the google i o
03:20 - extension conference for pittsburgh
03:22 - so google the google i o conference is
03:25 - going to go on next week their main
03:26 - conference at their headquarters but
03:28 - then
03:29 - all over
03:30 - i believe it's all over the world
03:33 - they're going to have these extension
03:34 - conferences so especially in places that
03:36 - have a google office so pittsburgh has a
03:40 - branch of google there
03:42 - and
03:43 - i'll be there but the reason i want to
03:46 - bring it up is
03:48 - well number one to say i definitely
03:49 - won't be streaming that day but also if
03:51 - anybody plans on going if you're in the
03:53 - pittsburgh area let me know it'd be
03:55 - awesome to meet up if you want
03:58 - when when we're at the conference
04:01 - and uh i'll try to
04:04 - i'm not gonna try to do a youtube live
04:06 - stream from there i don't think
04:08 - i don't think there'll be an opportunity
04:09 - for that but i may do something on
04:11 - instagram
04:13 - uh just some updates and things so if
04:15 - you have instagram and you don't follow
04:17 - me uh
04:19 - you'll
04:20 - find me on instagram i think if you go
04:22 - to my youtube channel uh i have
04:24 - instagram linked from there
04:26 - so
04:28 - um if you're interested in that sort of
04:30 - thing you know find me on there and i'll
04:33 - uh i'll try to put some updates in and
04:34 - then of course i'll tell you all about
04:36 - it the next day when i when i do have a
04:37 - chance to stream
04:39 - let's see uh since we're talking about
04:41 - conferences i'll also be at the
04:44 - revolution conf in virginia beach
04:48 - that's
04:49 - i don't know in a couple weeks or
04:50 - something
04:52 - so anybody in in virginia or that
04:54 - general area
04:56 - uh if you're if you're going to be the
04:58 - conference awesome if you're not going
04:59 - to be the conference but you're in that
05:00 - area and like to meet up let me know
05:02 - and i'll be speaking at the pittsburgh
05:06 - tech fest in june
05:08 - as well so
05:11 - anyway just thought i'd like to let you
05:13 - all know it'd be really cool uh i'd i'd
05:15 - hate to
05:16 - be somewhere where maybe where you all
05:19 - are and then
05:20 - uh miss an opportunity to to meet up or
05:24 - something so
05:26 - all right enough of me talking
05:29 - um
05:30 - we do have a question uh
05:33 - nikki says is the material design
05:35 - version 2 getting unveiled at google i o
05:37 - or is that just a rumor
05:39 - i
05:39 - i don't know i mean i've been seeing
05:41 - headlines about this material design
05:44 - version 2
05:45 - but i don't know for sure i would
05:47 - imagine if they're going to unveil it
05:49 - io is probably the place to do it
05:52 - that would be really cool
05:54 - so
05:57 - i'm definitely interested in that
05:59 - obviously since i use material design
06:02 - for most of my projects
06:05 - okay
06:06 - uh so let's start out
06:09 - let me share my screen
06:12 - so
06:13 - and then we're gonna start out with
06:16 - uh
06:17 - the domain name
06:19 - so let me
06:22 - i'm gonna do all my login stuff on my
06:24 - other screen and then move it over
06:27 - just so that i don't accidentally give
06:29 - away any
06:30 - important information
06:32 - and uh
06:33 - especially i believe we have this domain
06:37 - hosted with godaddy and i have quite a
06:40 - few godaddy accounts saved here so
06:43 - i don't want to give away like all seven
06:45 - of my godaddy usernames on the screen at
06:48 - once
06:51 - they're not all my accounts but they're
06:53 - accounts i have access to for clients
06:56 - and
06:58 - various
06:59 - accounts at the
07:00 - university okay
07:03 - let me see
07:06 - the university has several accounts and
07:08 - i can never remember which one has this
07:10 - uh
07:12 - this domain name
07:14 - so
07:15 - i may get the wrong one first
07:18 - i think
07:26 - all right
07:28 - i got the right one
07:32 - all right so
07:34 - i'm going to move this over
07:36 - there we go
07:37 - let me move this over
07:39 - now i'm going to do a little explanation
07:41 - as well
07:42 - because i'm just not sure how familiar
07:44 - you all are with handling domain names
07:47 - uh dns records and things like that it's
07:50 - not something you want to mess around
07:51 - with really um
07:54 - unless you know what you're doing so if
07:55 - you're using a domain that's not really
07:57 - linked up to anything then you know feel
07:58 - free to mess around as much as you want
08:00 - but if you're doing this for a client or
08:01 - for a live website you want to be very
08:03 - very careful because you can mess things
08:05 - up
08:07 - especially i mean not only with i mean
08:09 - really with any of the types of records
08:11 - you can mess it up but
08:13 - especially with mx records you can mess
08:15 - up somebody's entire email system which
08:18 - i've actually done before for a client
08:20 - years ago
08:22 - so it all got sorted out and you know
08:24 - but there were a few days there where
08:26 - emails weren't working so
08:28 - uh from experience i will tell you it's
08:31 - definitely a good idea to double check
08:33 - you know what you're doing uh you want
08:34 - to you know screenshot everything
08:37 - beforehand
08:39 - because if for some reason you lose all
08:42 - these ip addresses
08:45 - and would have to try to remember them
08:47 - or look them up to go back in it would
08:49 - take you much much longer to get these
08:52 - back where they're supposed to be so
08:55 - depending on where you host uh
08:59 - where you manage your domain from
09:01 - this panel is going to look different
09:03 - so the admin panels are are very
09:06 - different
09:08 - just depending on where you're at in
09:09 - terms of the style the design but what
09:11 - they should have
09:14 - is an area where it lists your types of
09:16 - records for right now these are all a
09:18 - records here
09:20 - you have a name your value and then um
09:23 - you know some seconds here the
09:25 - usually pretty standard i see is like
09:27 - 600 seconds
09:30 - um
09:32 - these correspond with subdomains
09:35 - right so right now we have quite a few
09:37 - subdomains here
09:40 - and
09:42 - the sub domains are pointed to an ip
09:45 - address
09:46 - right so
09:48 - for instance if you were to start up a
09:50 - digitalocean droplet
09:52 - it has an ip address right if you wanted
09:55 - that droplet
09:57 - if you wanted your sub domain to go to
09:59 - that droplet
10:01 - you would just take that ip address and
10:03 - you'd put it in here as an a record so
10:06 - if we wanted begin.franciscan.university
10:11 - to go to our droplet let's we just pop
10:13 - the
10:15 - ip address in right there right and now
10:19 - sometimes there's a delay it just it
10:21 - depends and i'm hoping that there's not
10:23 - too much delay when we do this
10:25 - otherwise we may not be able to see the
10:27 - result for a while
10:29 - but i wanted to do it
10:31 - with you instead of doing it beforehand
10:33 - so
10:34 - hopefully it'll all work out and i just
10:37 - remembered that i did not start my timer
10:41 - here's the timer all right let me start
10:43 - that up
10:44 - uh that way aft after 25 minutes is over
10:47 - i'm gonna take a break i'm gonna answer
10:48 - some questions there in the live chat
10:52 - so
10:54 - first thing we need to do is figure out
10:56 - what we want our
10:58 - um
11:00 - our sub domain to be for this
11:03 - so normally like test or dev
11:07 - is a reasonable one if this is going to
11:09 - be a test site
11:10 - so let's see if we have that already
11:15 - okay we do have test and we have test
11:18 - one
11:19 - let's check page two
11:28 - and page three just to be sure
11:33 - okay so
11:34 - what i'm gonna do is uh
11:37 - i'm gonna make a domain name called dev
11:40 - so it'll or a subdomain called dev so
11:42 - the url will be dev dot franciscan dot
11:45 - university
11:47 - uh so that i mean that's a reasonable uh
11:50 - domain name i think
11:52 - or a sub domain so what we're gonna do
11:55 - is select in this case a cname record
12:02 - and we're going to say
12:04 - dev
12:07 - points2
12:09 - and this is where we need to get a value
12:11 - from
12:12 - now so let's go to the now documentation
12:16 - site
12:18 - now there we go
12:21 - and once i get to the right page i'll
12:23 - paste the link in the chat
12:26 - i see there's a lot of activity in the
12:28 - chat just hey everyone i'll definitely
12:30 - check out the chat here in a few minutes
12:32 - so we're gonna go to our documentation
12:36 - and
12:37 - assign a domain name
12:41 - and let me make this much bigger so you
12:43 - all can see
12:44 - and i'm going to copy this and paste it
12:50 - if anybody uses spotify the throwback
12:52 - thursday playlist is from the year 2000
12:55 - which i was in
12:58 - high school in the year 2000
13:00 - except my
13:02 - maybe middle school so maybe around 8th
13:05 - grade uh or my freshman year somewhere
13:08 - like that so
13:10 - if anybody shares similar nostalgia for
13:12 - the year 2000 check out the throwback
13:14 - thursday playlist on spotify
13:18 - um okay so
13:22 - the links pasted now in the chat if it
13:24 - doesn't work when you click it please
13:26 - try to copy and paste it and into your
13:28 - browser directly and then that should
13:29 - work
13:30 - so we're gonna try to do it with a cname
13:33 - right so
13:36 - these other options
13:38 - you're welcome to use those and they may
13:40 - be better for your use case but for our
13:42 - use case here really our only option is
13:46 - to use the the c name
13:51 - so
13:54 - we need to
13:56 - point it to alias
14:02 - zeit dot co
14:09 - and
14:11 - i believe it's alias outside
14:14 - oca yeah
14:17 - um now that i think about it i did this
14:19 - with another site recently this might be
14:22 - outdated we'll see
14:23 - if it is outdated then maybe we'll uh
14:25 - submit a pull request to update this but
14:28 - we'll find out in a minute
14:30 - so we we do need
14:32 - a terminal window open so let's see
14:35 - where this is
14:37 - all right i'm going to move this over so
14:39 - it's on the same screen
14:41 - with us here
14:45 - and
14:49 - let me just get a fresh
14:54 - new tab
14:56 - there we go we'll just start with a
14:57 - fresh one here
15:00 - and
15:03 - oops i forgot to put it in i'm skipping
15:05 - a step there we go we need to put that
15:07 - in here
15:08 - alias dot sight dot co
15:11 - and we'll drop this down
15:14 - to
15:14 - 600
15:16 - right we want this to go as quickly as
15:18 - possible all right so now we have our
15:20 - cname record and so the subdomain dev
15:23 - should go here so if if you want your
15:27 - particular subdomain to point to
15:30 - a
15:31 - uh
15:32 - a url use a c name if you wanted to
15:35 - point to an ip address use an a record
15:39 - okay so
15:41 - that's kind of just a really basic
15:43 - difference between the two
15:46 - so let's let's see
15:48 - and i believe we'll find out really
15:50 - quickly whether or not that was the the
15:52 - way to go um
15:55 - i
15:56 - let's see if you know what i think we
15:58 - already have this
15:59 - yeah let's go ahead and just do it over
16:01 - here
16:04 - since this is already where we want it
16:06 - to be now let's let's make sure we're
16:08 - ready so
16:10 - um we'll do a get pool i just did one
16:12 - but
16:13 - i want to do it on
16:15 - on the stream
16:17 - so you always want to begin work with a
16:19 - get pool because you may have pushed
16:22 - something to github and you didn't
16:24 - remember or somebody else
16:26 - that's working on the same project may
16:28 - have so you definitely want to make sure
16:29 - you have the latest stuff
16:31 - so we do happen to have the latest stuff
16:34 - and now i want to
16:37 - let's just do a yarn
16:39 - um so i know that i didn't have any new
16:41 - packages but that's another step that
16:43 - you always want to take to make sure
16:44 - that you have the latest packages if
16:46 - you're not using yarn you can use npm
16:48 - install i believe just typing npm works
16:52 - now as well
16:55 - now the next thing we want to do is
16:57 - use our commands from our documentation
16:59 - here
17:01 - so what we're going to do is type now
17:03 - alias
17:06 - and
17:07 - we're going oops
17:10 - option http
17:14 - no we actually need to type
17:18 - need this first
17:20 - so let's run now
17:26 - there may be a way to combine some of
17:28 - these steps but since we're going
17:29 - through the first time i think it'd be
17:30 - better to do it separately anyway
17:35 - so
17:36 - what this is doing now that we've typed
17:38 - in now so i have installed now on my
17:40 - machine so that's another step you will
17:42 - have to take is just to install it if
17:44 - you go into the documentation for now
17:48 - then
17:49 - um
17:51 - you can figure there's there's several
17:54 - ways that you can download it on your
17:55 - machine so you can pick whichever way uh
17:57 - works best for you
17:59 - so we've been given this
18:02 - url here so basically a default now url
18:06 - is going to be the name of your project
18:09 - plus
18:10 - uh kind of a random string
18:12 - and then dot now dot sh
18:16 - it's it's nice but it's not really easy
18:19 - for a tester or user to type in right we
18:22 - we wouldn't want that to be our our
18:25 - actual url for our website
18:28 - so we'll let that go i mean it's
18:32 - this is taking uh
18:35 - all of our files
18:37 - and
18:39 - running them on a server so if i don't
18:42 - know how many of you were with me
18:44 - whenever we set up digitalocean servers
18:47 - but compare that
18:49 - process
18:50 - which if you're lucky and you do
18:52 - everything right you can set up a server
18:55 - to run react
18:57 - you know with ssl and everything maybe
19:00 - in an hour
19:01 - right
19:03 - but
19:04 - this isn't a matter of minutes
19:08 - and there's no maintenance
19:12 - so while that's happening
19:14 - i'm going to check the
19:16 - the chat
19:17 - let's check the time too
19:20 - all right 16
19:22 - 16 minutes
19:24 - let's see
19:27 - uh
19:28 - david
19:29 - said ask is this like heroku uh
19:33 - sort of yeah it's it's a way to deploy
19:38 - okay so we are successful so what it did
19:42 - uh which is kind of nice is it
19:43 - automatically save this url to the
19:45 - clipboard which is cool we don't we
19:47 - don't have to copy it so let's go over
19:49 - here and just visit it to verify that it
19:51 - is working
19:56 - and i'm going to click around a bit
20:00 - wonderful
20:04 - um
20:08 - let's see
20:10 - undergraduates
20:13 - great
20:15 - let's go back to the home page and
20:18 - let's make sure this is working
20:20 - wonderful looks like everything's
20:21 - working
20:24 - great
20:26 - so
20:27 - that was that was really fast right like
20:29 - this is our site running
20:32 - in a production environment
20:34 - it's fast
20:35 - it has an ssl
20:38 - i mean that's
20:40 - that's amazing i mean i
20:42 - if you've never gone through the process
20:44 - of setting up a server yourself in the
20:46 - sso and everything like it it may not
20:49 - seem like a lot but
20:52 - it's really
20:53 - really amazing i did see nikki had a
20:56 - question about does now also support
20:58 - separate deployments per branch i have
21:00 - deployed things uh different branches
21:03 - before as well so i have a deployment
21:05 - right now of the catechetical institute
21:07 - website
21:09 - that's just the upgrade branch
21:12 - so that's
21:14 - that's definitely a possibility you have
21:15 - a branch that's your your latest stuff
21:17 - you want to
21:18 - let your client see it
21:20 - uh before it goes live let's say on the
21:23 - main url you can make a test sub domain
21:25 - and just push that branch so all you
21:27 - would do is
21:29 - go into you know you do a get checkout
21:31 - on that branch
21:34 - and then once you're on that branch you
21:36 - run now from that branch
21:39 - so
21:41 - a great
21:42 - great question
21:45 - and it's definitely possible so now that
21:47 - we have this let's type in now
21:50 - alias
21:51 - we're going to paste this in so we want
21:53 - this url to go to
21:56 - dev
21:59 - dot
22:03 - franciscan dot university
22:06 - now it's not going to work this time
22:09 - but that's
22:11 - to be expected
22:14 - but we need to get some uh some info
22:17 - here
22:19 - because we're going to need to set up a
22:21 - text record as well
22:23 - to make this work
22:25 - and we're gonna get that record once
22:27 - this
22:28 - does its thing
22:47 - see
22:48 - all right cool so we have this now
22:50 - and you can see we have a few pieces of
22:53 - information
22:54 - so first it says
22:58 - you could uh set your name servers to
23:00 - this which we're not gonna do
23:02 - we're using the alternative way and
23:04 - that's we've we've already set
23:07 - our
23:09 - cname to use alias.co
23:13 - and now we need to make a text
23:16 - record that
23:18 - has this value
23:20 - so i'm definitely going to copy that
23:22 - value
23:25 - we're going to copy that and now let's
23:27 - make this record
23:30 - so we're going to go back to our domain
23:32 - we're going to add
23:34 - a
23:35 - text record
23:37 - and the host is going to be underscore
23:39 - now
23:42 - and then there's the value
23:46 - and
23:47 - we'll set this custom as well
23:52 - and let's save
23:55 - and we'll see we now have this text
23:57 - record
23:58 - and let's compare
24:08 - uh the text mentioned above the error
24:10 - message
24:20 - okay i remember now um this
24:23 - i remember which part of this i had
24:25 - thought about creating a pull request
24:27 - for so this screenshot
24:30 - is from an older version
24:33 - of of now so that's why it looks
24:35 - differently so i had thought
24:37 - of
24:38 - uh potentially replacing that
24:41 - um it was yeah
24:44 - so we're not going to do that now
24:45 - because it's
24:47 - it's not really a big deal because the
24:49 - newer version
24:51 - uh expl i think explains it better
24:55 - when you're running the command
24:59 - so now that we have that text record
25:02 - again
25:03 - we're going to run this command over
25:05 - again
25:09 - so
25:11 - there's that same command and when we
25:13 - run it this time
25:16 - it should work
25:18 - all right good so we have our
25:20 - success message here
25:22 - so now it's going to generate an ssl
25:24 - certificate
25:25 - and it's going to set that up so this
25:27 - may take a minute or so
25:29 - but once it's done we should be able to
25:31 - go to dev.franciscan.university
25:34 - and see our site
25:36 - oh wow that was really fast
25:38 - awesome
25:42 - so
25:42 - let's go over here
25:44 - and we'll go to dev
25:47 - oops dev
25:49 - dot
25:55 - university and you all can try this out
25:56 - as well dev dot franciscan whoops if i
25:59 - could spell it right
26:03 - let's try that again
26:04 - dev dot
26:12 - there we go
26:14 - yay it works
26:16 - so i'm gonna paste this into the chat
26:20 - and uh that way you all can can check it
26:22 - out you can see this definitely works
26:26 - we can click around to
26:32 - wherever we want
26:34 - and
26:36 - it runs
26:37 - and it's fast it's so fast this is why i
26:42 - i don't know you know
26:44 - the details of how things deployed on
26:47 - now end up being so fast
26:50 - i'm sure there's more details on the
26:51 - website
26:52 - i remember reading something before when
26:54 - it first came out but i'm not even gonna
26:57 - try to explain it uh it is just fast
27:02 - so
27:06 - i do want to
27:09 - i want to go over how you would keep
27:11 - this up right so
27:13 - this is great
27:14 - but what happens when you want to update
27:16 - it
27:17 - so
27:18 - obviously like your site's gonna change
27:21 - uh over time this site's gonna change
27:23 - it'll probably change you know today
27:27 - so how do we keep things up-to-date
27:29 - easily
27:31 - uh so
27:32 - there is a way to make this whole
27:34 - process a bit easier in terms of
27:37 - updating
27:38 - and
27:40 - let's see where it's at
27:44 - i want to show you
27:48 - how to do this
27:53 - i may not be able to find it in the
27:55 - documentation you may just have to
27:59 - have to just do
28:00 - it guys
28:04 - hey this is
28:17 - all right i'll just do it i'm sure it's
28:19 - in the documentation somewhere but it's
28:22 - i still remember how to do this so
28:26 - here's what we're going to do
28:27 - we're going to add in a
28:33 - basically
28:35 - a new section into our package json
28:38 - that is going to have configuration for
28:41 - now now there's a lot of other options
28:44 - actually that let me find this in the in
28:46 - here because
28:47 - there we go
28:50 - okay here we are
28:52 - so
28:53 - we can put in this now option
28:56 - and we can put in an alias
28:58 - we can
29:01 - add in it should have yeah here we are
29:04 - so we have all these other these options
29:07 - of
29:08 - uh
29:08 - to configure now right there so
29:12 - um
29:15 - name alias uh we have like environment
29:18 - variables which is very useful uh scale
29:21 - which we're not going to worry about
29:23 - scaling now but whenever we actually
29:25 - launch the site the uh the live version
29:28 - of the site
29:29 - uh
29:31 - we're gonna do some stuff with scale so
29:33 - we'll explain it more then
29:36 - um this is like
29:38 - um
29:40 - well still scale stuff
29:42 - oh wait um
29:44 - so there's a lot of different things you
29:46 - could see i'm still scrolling you know
29:48 - still uh with this configuration but for
29:51 - now what we really need is
29:54 - uh is the alias so that's what we're
29:56 - gonna check out
29:59 - uh actually let me make sure i have time
30:01 - to do this before my timer runs out
30:03 - five minutes yeah we're good okay
30:08 - so
30:11 - what we want to do then
30:20 - is uh where am i gonna put this
30:24 - all right i'm just gonna put it here
30:26 - so we're gonna make this now
30:29 - and
30:31 - so this is right our package json it's
30:33 - just a json file
30:35 - so
30:37 - same format as normal
30:39 - we're going to write we're going to have
30:40 - an alias
30:47 - and
30:51 - and then for our alias we're going to
30:54 - put in
30:55 - our urls we're going to go dev dot
30:59 - franciscan dot
31:04 - university let me double check that i
31:06 - spelled it right this time
31:10 - there we go all right so that is spelled
31:12 - correctly
31:15 - all right awesome and that's all we're
31:16 - going to do right now
31:18 - to set this up
31:20 - so
31:23 - i guess we could just
31:25 - let's let's just test this out so i'm
31:26 - going to make an update now the update's
31:29 - really not going to do anything uh that
31:31 - a user can see on the site but
31:33 - let's go
31:34 - let's do git status we see we've updated
31:37 - that let's do git add and then we'll do
31:40 - yarn cm so this is how we've set up our
31:44 - custom way to set up to uh make
31:48 - pull requests
31:49 - um
31:52 - build
31:53 - yeah
31:54 - maybe
32:06 - maybe we'll put it under build i don't
32:08 - let's do it
32:09 - um
32:16 - alias
32:21 - okay so we'll let this run through all
32:22 - the tests
32:24 - and then
32:27 - we will
32:31 - try this out let's see
32:47 - uh oh
32:49 - i'm not running the server that's why
32:52 - let's do
32:54 - you aren't dev
32:59 - oh it looks like
33:04 - all right so i already have a server
33:06 - running
33:10 - here so let's stop this
33:13 - oops
33:22 - there we go
33:23 - we're going to stop that one so we can
33:25 - start this one up
33:27 - sorry about that
33:31 - you are in dev
33:33 - and it looks like we have it it came up
33:35 - with a message saying that there's a new
33:37 - version of next so
33:39 - suppose we're going to be doing an up
33:41 - update to the latest version of next
33:43 - sometime soon
33:47 - and
33:48 - when this is done
33:49 - now we'll try to run this again so we're
33:52 - going to do yarn cm but we're going to
33:53 - go with um
33:56 - uh
33:57 - retry
33:58 - is that what it is
34:00 - let's see him retry
34:03 - i think that's the command we want
34:06 - nope
34:11 - two of them
34:14 - there we go that's it
34:15 - so we don't have to type in our commit
34:18 - message and everything again when we use
34:20 - retry with the double
34:22 - hyphens
34:24 - so now it should work if you happen to
34:26 - be working on this project and you run
34:27 - into a similar issue just make sure that
34:29 - you're running the server
34:31 - before you try to commit because the
34:33 - test will try to run but they can't
34:35 - without the server so that did work so
34:37 - now we're going to do
34:40 - now
34:42 - right so
34:46 - you know what can we just run now alias
34:50 - we may be able to run now alias i
34:55 - i can't remember exactly
35:00 - see we i don't think we have a search
35:08 - i wonder if it says it down here
35:31 - hmm
35:32 - i don't remember exactly where it is so
35:33 - let's
35:35 - let's run now
35:46 - so now we're going to have another url a
35:49 - different one from the one we had before
35:52 - and so it'll be another instance
35:54 - the cool thing about now is like
35:57 - like right now i'm not on a paid plan i
35:59 - have a free plan
36:00 - i can start these
36:02 - instances up
36:04 - uh and
36:06 - it's it's entirely free uh we're
36:09 - eventually gonna move on to a paid plan
36:13 - which will
36:16 - i might work on that today
36:19 - buying things at a university usually
36:22 - involves paperwork and going through
36:23 - stuff so i'm going gonna consult with my
36:26 - colleague about what the best way to is
36:28 - to go about
36:30 - paying for an account
36:33 - i think my timer just ran out so i'm
36:35 - gonna scroll up and start answering
36:37 - questions and then once this is finished
36:40 - we'll run um
36:42 - the next command
36:46 - i should have changed something so that
36:47 - we could see what was happening in that
36:49 - website but
36:54 - it's too late now this will work
37:05 - john hanson says hey all summer like
37:06 - today iced coffee time yeah the
37:08 - weather's been really nice
37:10 - um
37:12 - i mean i'm in i'm near pittsburgh and uh
37:15 - in the united states and the weather is
37:17 - like
37:19 - 80 degrees
37:20 - uh super nice
37:25 - and i did get iced coffee what day was
37:27 - it
37:28 - tuesday
37:29 - tuesday i had
37:31 - dentist appointment and doctor's
37:33 - appointment and uh
37:35 - so
37:36 - i stopped and got an iced coffee between
37:39 - i just stopped at the dunkin donuts and
37:41 - i'm glad i did they had wi-fi and then
37:43 - one of my clients websites from a long
37:45 - time ago
37:46 - uh crashed
37:47 - and so they emailed me or like hey the
37:50 - site's down and uh so i checked it out
37:54 - and was made i managed to get it back up
37:56 - and running
37:58 - uh while during my stop at dunkin donuts
38:01 - uh in between my appointments so that
38:03 - worked out really well and i happened to
38:06 - have my laptop with me which was also
38:10 - very nice
38:11 - okay so now that we do this let's type
38:13 - now
38:14 - now alias
38:17 - and i believe
38:18 - yep there we go
38:19 - so here's here's what we've done
38:22 - if you can't see that i'm going to read
38:24 - through a little bit but it is assigning
38:26 - alias deb
38:27 - franciscan.university to the deployment
38:29 - franciscan university react and then mk
38:31 - jd whatever and that's the one we just
38:34 - did so it's not our old
38:36 - deployment that we just made like a half
38:38 - hour ago or something uh about then this
38:42 - is a new one so now
38:44 - what we're able to do every time
38:47 - we want to push our new updates to our
38:51 - test site
38:53 - we just type now
38:55 - followed by now alias
38:58 - you probably could do now and now it so
39:01 - like something like this now
39:03 - [Music]
39:06 - so you probably could do it like this if
39:08 - you want to do it all in one command
39:09 - which just would save time you could
39:11 - just do it and leave
39:13 - assuming that you're confident that no
39:15 - errors will will happen
39:17 - um
39:18 - but yeah so basically
39:20 - now all you have to do is just this
39:22 - command it will deploy
39:25 - your new changes to a new instance
39:28 - and then switch it so i mean think about
39:32 - like the the beauty of this is
39:35 - like we're talking about no downtime
39:37 - when we update
39:40 - it's amazing like normally let's say we
39:42 - have um
39:44 - a
39:45 - droplet on digitalocean or server
39:47 - somewhere and we only have one server
39:49 - you go in you go to update what do you
39:51 - need to do uh if you're using like git
39:53 - for deployment
39:55 - uh you need to do a get pool you need to
39:57 - build
39:58 - right
39:59 - and then you'll need to start that
40:01 - server again so that means there's going
40:02 - to be a period of downtime depending on
40:04 - how long your build is like how fast
40:06 - your servers there's going to be a
40:08 - little downtime it might not be that
40:09 - much
40:10 - but
40:11 - you don't want to deal with that what
40:13 - we've done here is
40:15 - we have
40:16 - our instance
40:18 - right so it's like we have a server
40:19 - that's running
40:21 - um like imagine on digitalocean you're
40:24 - running two servers right load balanced
40:27 - so you shut one down all the traffic
40:30 - goes to the other
40:31 - and then you do your updates and then
40:33 - you switch to the other one do your
40:35 - updates right but i'm but think about
40:37 - all the work that goes into that setting
40:39 - up two servers paying for two servers
40:41 - even if you go with five dollar servers
40:42 - it's still ten dollars a month
40:44 - to do the
40:46 - uh digital ocean load balancing that's
40:48 - twenty dollars a month for the load
40:49 - balancer so now you're up to 30 dollars
40:52 - a month
40:53 - and the process to update still
40:56 - if you haven't really automated anything
40:58 - it's still logging into a server
41:01 - uh doing your get pool doing a build
41:04 - starting it back up logging into another
41:06 - server repeating the same process
41:09 - right and that's only with two if you
41:11 - had multiple servers it could be
41:13 - even more involved process now we switch
41:16 - that to where
41:18 - we have an instance running and our
41:20 - domain name is pointing to that instance
41:23 - we get another instance up and running
41:25 - with all our changes and then when that
41:27 - one's ready we simply point the domain
41:30 - to the new one there's zero downtime
41:33 - right but we don't have to worry about
41:35 - the the old one is gone in terms of
41:38 - it for from the user's perspective i
41:41 - could still use that old really long url
41:43 - and get to it but it's just gonna get
41:45 - shut down
41:46 - right it's going to go to sleep
41:48 - um and
41:50 - it's not going to be active anymore
41:53 - and
41:55 - now we have a really fast way there's no
41:57 - logging into servers it's all right
41:59 - there for the command line i type in now
42:02 - and now alias
42:04 - and it's ready i mean it's
42:06 - there's definitely advantages to this
42:08 - way of deployment so okay
42:11 - i'm not getting paid to promote this or
42:13 - anything like that i'm just very
42:15 - impressed by it so i'm i'm gonna get to
42:18 - the questions now
42:22 - anna says hi michael says hi hey how's
42:25 - it going
42:29 - uh divest says does data rendering
42:31 - always happen through ajax call and
42:33 - react except for server-side rendering
42:36 - um
42:38 - yeah i mean you can use fetch uh
42:40 - instead of ajax i mean you're probably
42:43 - going to do fetch
42:45 - um
42:46 - but
42:49 - yeah i mean basically
42:51 - if you're going to do
42:52 - if you're going to get data on the fly
42:54 - client side that's that's the way to do
42:56 - it
43:03 - uh ch
43:04 - chanikya says
43:06 - hello hey how's it going thanks for
43:10 - watching oh michael said i'm already
43:13 - lost that didn't take long sorry
43:16 - uh
43:18 - christian says hi and how are you today
43:20 - um
43:21 - not not bad and also asked how my day is
43:24 - going so
43:26 - yeah day's not bad uh
43:29 - i was up
43:30 - early with the baby
43:32 - and um
43:34 - didn't really get anything done even
43:36 - though i was up early because i was
43:37 - trying to keep her entertained in a room
43:39 - and quiet so that she didn't wake up
43:40 - everyone else in the house
43:42 - uh so
43:44 - didn't get a chance to work out this
43:46 - morning
43:47 - definitely gonna try to work out when i
43:48 - get home though
43:49 - and uh so i i started
43:53 - i look i'm bringing this up because you
43:54 - asked how my day is so uh apologies to
43:57 - those who just want to know about the
43:58 - code but briefly to
44:01 - give you a little update on my life
44:03 - um
44:05 - so i you all know that i you know
44:07 - battled depression um
44:10 - and
44:11 - exercise definitely helps me a lot so
44:13 - i've been trying to exercise more and
44:15 - i've also added to that i'm on a diet
44:17 - now
44:18 - so
44:19 - i weighed myself on saturday and i
44:21 - weighed significantly more than i've
44:23 - ever weighed before in my life i weighed
44:25 - 190 pounds two years ago i weighed 150
44:28 - pounds so it's a definitely a huge
44:30 - increase so i decided to go on a diet i
44:32 - mean i don't i don't look like i'm
44:34 - overweight but realistically 190 pounds
44:37 - is probably
44:38 - you know too much for someone who's five
44:40 - foot ten
44:42 - so decided to go on a diet
44:44 - really weird for me i've never really
44:46 - been on a lose weight diet before
44:50 - so i'm in the middle of that
44:52 - so my eating habits are different i'm
44:54 - it's not like a really
44:57 - uh complicated diet it's just
44:59 - uh taking
45:01 - you know less calories
45:03 - than than i
45:04 - um
45:07 - burn more calories than i take in right
45:09 - that's that's the plan uh but with that
45:12 - i'm trying to make sure that i maximize
45:13 - the amount of protein i eat
45:15 - and i'm trying to do do workouts so
45:18 - cardio workouts weights things like that
45:22 - as much as i can get in
45:25 - so that's where i'm at so so far i've
45:27 - lost five pounds since saturday
45:30 - which i think is good uh i haven't like
45:32 - i said i haven't really dieted that much
45:34 - so but i'm trying to feel it out so i
45:36 - think i'm probably taking in too few
45:38 - calories because uh my muscles aren't
45:41 - recovering as fast as they normally do
45:44 - so
45:44 - i might have to adjust it a bit but
45:46 - anyway so far i actually feel i feel
45:49 - good uh my depression is
45:52 - not bad at all
45:54 - so
45:55 - maybe maybe i've like accidentally
45:57 - stumbled on
45:58 - some other helpful thing
46:00 - of uh
46:02 - you know kind of eating healthier will
46:03 - also help my depression which now that i
46:05 - say it sounds like hey why didn't i
46:07 - think of that before but i realistically
46:10 - just never
46:11 - correlated my diet with my depression so
46:15 - anyway that's my mental health and
46:17 - personal life uh
46:19 - story for today
46:25 - let's see uh christian says uh you're
46:27 - not using webpack for this
46:30 - um
46:31 - well i mean webpack's involved in some
46:33 - of the process uh
46:35 - in terms of
46:39 - uh like the the build right so
46:43 - when we use next webpack is like
46:45 - pre-configured so there's a lot of web
46:47 - pack going on behind the scenes but we
46:49 - don't directly
46:50 - uh configure anything
46:58 - uh john hanson says uh they're talking
47:01 - about urls is there a way to write an
47:04 - anchor tag url href to search a string
47:07 - in the visitor's own default search
47:09 - engine and a new window
47:12 - hmm
47:15 - i've i've never tried that or even
47:18 - thought about doing that before
47:25 - yeah i'm not sure
47:31 - yeah i don't know about the user's
47:32 - default search engine i mean potentially
47:35 - you could have uh you could open a new
47:38 - window with a string that would uh like
47:42 - automatically put in
47:43 - whatever you want to search for like
47:45 - into a search query uh if if that's how
47:48 - that search engine works so then it
47:49 - would give you results it's like
47:53 - uh
47:54 - you know you can search for something on
47:55 - google and then copy and paste that url
47:58 - and then somebody else can see those
47:59 - results
48:00 - so i mean essentially you just
48:02 - need to build that
48:04 - url like that so i mean it's but i don't
48:06 - know how you would know what their
48:08 - default search engine is
48:11 - i don't i don't know of any um
48:17 - any like browser api that lets you know
48:19 - what their default search engine is not
48:21 - to say it doesn't exist i've just never
48:23 - heard of it
48:30 - rizwan says hello hey how's it going
48:32 - thanks for watching
48:38 - evo says hey hey how's it going
48:41 - uh evo says quick question are you using
48:43 - typescript with react if so how do you
48:45 - handle styling
48:47 - no i'm not using typescript with uh with
48:50 - react so i haven't really done that much
48:52 - with typescript i'm not against
48:54 - typescript i just
48:56 - just haven't really used it
48:59 - evo says just in general how do you
49:01 - handle styling and react without style
49:03 - components
49:04 - i've imported css files with classes
49:06 - into components but that just feels
49:08 - dirty for some reason
49:09 - yeah i mean
49:10 - there's a lot of different ways to do
49:12 - styles in react
49:15 - so
49:18 - as far as i know there's not one way
49:20 - that's like this is the best way you
49:22 - have to do it like this
49:23 - there's a lot of different ways
49:26 - generally
49:27 - you know having your
49:29 - css
49:30 - somewhere in the actual component
49:34 - uh that seems to me to be the best way
49:36 - to handle things
49:38 - because then your components become you
49:40 - know very modular and reusable
49:43 - so
49:44 - there are a variety of ways to
49:46 - accomplish that so whatever way works
49:48 - best with you and what your overall
49:50 - system
49:51 - i think is is fine
49:57 - phoenix is here phoenix says hello hey
49:59 - how's it going says you started early
50:00 - today i did i i started a little early
50:03 - for a time i was starting the streams at
50:05 - like 11 a.m eastern time
50:07 - which is even earlier than i did today
50:10 - uh i just kind of got off track with
50:13 - different meetings and things going on
50:20 - hey frankie's here says hey sensei
50:23 - hey how's it going
50:26 - let's see
50:31 - eric knows best says what do you
50:33 - recommend to learn react
50:38 - check out the react documentation
50:41 - the latest version of free code camp so
50:44 - the beta version uh has some react stuff
50:46 - in it as well i personally haven't gone
50:48 - through it yet so i don't i don't know
50:50 - uh if that's enough to really learn it i
50:54 - think google says react um
50:58 - code academy has react course
51:02 - yeah that's where i would go
51:04 - uh to do to do react and then of course
51:07 - there's there are plenty of youtube
51:09 - tutorials we have some on on the free
51:11 - code camp channel
51:14 - so i mean that pretty much has you
51:15 - covered you know between video
51:17 - text if you're gonna do the react
51:19 - documentation uh or like guided learning
51:23 - um in terms of the code academy course
51:25 - between those that should give you a
51:27 - really good introduction you know no
51:28 - matter what your learning style is
51:41 - all right nikki says it's immutable yeah
51:43 - new urls for each deploy and auto
51:45 - writing was already there that's awesome
51:47 - yeah for sure
51:49 - super super awesome
51:51 - um frankie says are you fasting um
51:55 - eric's is uh intermittent fast
51:57 - intermittent fasting is the best
52:00 - um
52:02 - yeah so i i'm not
52:05 - purposely doing intermittent fasting uh
52:08 - i
52:09 - in like practice though i have been
52:11 - uh holding off on eating till later in
52:14 - the day
52:15 - uh that's just kind of been like
52:18 - i've been waking up later than normal
52:20 - and they haven't had time to eat so i'm
52:21 - just like okay well i'll just wait
52:23 - uh so i'm not purposely doing it
52:26 - i i need to learn more about
52:28 - intermittent fasting
52:29 - uh because if i'm going to do it i want
52:31 - to do it the right way i i don't want to
52:32 - like
52:33 - mess up
52:35 - uh mess myself up so i'm not i'm not
52:38 - actually doing it
52:40 - i'm um
52:42 - i said i'm just tracking all my calories
52:44 - i'm tracking my protein
52:46 - and
52:48 - you know i'm just making sure that i
52:50 - i burn more calories than i take in at
52:52 - this point
52:56 - frankie says thanks for sharing your
52:58 - story with us oh yeah no no problem i
53:00 - just
53:01 - uh
53:02 - i always get nervous when i share
53:04 - because i i wonder
53:05 - how many people actually care about that
53:07 - kind of stuff uh and if you'd rather
53:10 - just do more coding so
53:11 - um yeah but i don't i don't mind sharing
53:15 - as long as you are somewhat interested i
53:17 - guess
53:18 - uh john says five pounds is often just
53:21 - water weight especially when eating more
53:22 - protein long term of comparison weights
53:25 - will tell more okay cool that that
53:28 - actually explains it more because i kind
53:30 - of thought like
53:31 - five pounds seems like a lot of weight
53:33 - right like how do i lose five pounds in
53:36 - what's five days and that's
53:39 - so that that makes more sense
53:42 - christian says thank thank you for
53:44 - sharing man what you do on this channel
53:46 - is awesome and it really helps me to
53:47 - learn react faster i'm new to react
53:49 - node.js and all that oh you're welcome
53:52 - i'm i'm really glad that this is uh is
53:54 - helpful to you
54:05 - michael says
54:07 - wouldn't the browser send them to
54:08 - default search page so this goes back to
54:10 - the question about
54:11 - the search
54:13 - well i don't
54:16 - i don't know because if you're going to
54:18 - put that search string in
54:20 - it's it's going to be a url to a
54:23 - particular search engine
54:25 - so
54:27 - you would there would have to be some
54:29 - way to
54:30 - find out what the default search page is
54:33 - so you can construct the proper url
54:36 - uh at least that's that's what i'm
54:38 - thinking uh maybe there's some other way
54:40 - that i'm missing
54:42 - harsh it's here hey harsha says i was
54:45 - unable to make it some work came up oh
54:46 - yeah
54:47 - no problem marsha
54:50 - um frankie says we care
54:53 - thanks i i appreciate that
54:56 - um
54:58 - john says homeostasis is that endorphin
55:01 - high while your body readjusts enjoy it
55:03 - while it lasts okay so cool so john
55:07 - john knows what's going on then so
55:09 - evidently
55:10 - i'm gonna have this
55:12 - uh this endorphin high while i'm i'm
55:15 - switching into my diet mode so
55:18 - it's actually good to know that it won't
55:19 - last so now i won't think something's
55:21 - wrong whenever
55:22 - i lose that feeling
55:29 - all right she says title on home page
55:31 - says my page still in devface
55:34 - does it still say my page
55:36 - oh yeah it does
55:39 - i gotta make sure i change that
55:42 - all right good
55:46 - good eye on there let me see does it
55:48 - change yeah it never changes all right
55:51 - definitely got to make sure that changes
56:00 - all right um well i've gotten to the end
56:03 - of all the questions on the chat we only
56:05 - did one pomodoro session of coding
56:07 - because i mean we got everything done in
56:10 - in one so we didn't really need it uh
56:12 - still ended up getting an hour-long
56:14 - stream in so
56:16 - um
56:19 - if if there are any more questions and
56:21 - you get them in here within the next
56:22 - minute or so i can get to them otherwise
56:24 - i think i'm gonna you know finish up the
56:27 - stream now
56:29 - phoenix says i've started 30 days 30
56:32 - sites i now
56:34 - know i need to pick up my pace of
56:36 - development
56:37 - yeah wow so you're going to build 30
56:39 - websites in 30 days
56:41 - that's crazy
56:46 - that's really crazy
56:50 - let me know how that goes phoenix that's
56:52 - that's interesting
56:56 - all right so
57:02 - uh christian is the whole page in
57:03 - javascript react and node.js
57:09 - yeah
57:10 - yeah i mean that's pretty much
57:12 - what we're using uh in terms of
57:15 - on
57:16 - i mean we got we got some other stuff
57:18 - going on on different servers in terms
57:19 - of content management database but on
57:21 - the react server i mean that's
57:23 - that's what it is um
57:25 - react with
57:27 - next js
57:29 - we have apollo
57:31 - for graphql
57:32 - and then we have node i mean we're
57:34 - running express with node but
57:36 - i mean basically yes it's all it's all
57:38 - javascript
57:40 - on those react servers
57:44 - all right
57:46 - well
57:47 - i think that's it for this stream
57:49 - thank you so much for watching
57:52 - this is one of the rare times when
57:54 - everything went right we didn't have any
57:55 - problems
57:57 - uh so i'm happy about that
58:00 - um
58:01 - let's see what's smart friday i'm gonna
58:03 - try to stream tomorrow i will be at home
58:05 - tomorrow so hopefully i can get a stream
58:07 - in uh still working on that stream
58:09 - quality
58:10 - so i can't guarantee anything
58:13 - but i'll try my best to stream and to
58:16 - give a good quality stream
58:19 - so
58:21 - hopefully i'll see you all tomorrow if
58:23 - not uh next week
58:25 - on monday
58:26 - and uh until then
