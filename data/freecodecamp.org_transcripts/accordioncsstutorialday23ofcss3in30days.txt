00:00 - well hello everybody welcome back to
00:01 - css3 in 30 days today is day number 23
00:05 - and we're going to be building a css3
00:08 - accordion this is what i'm talking about
00:10 - over here an accordion is simply
00:13 - grouping of elements and content and
00:16 - typically uh how an accordion would work
00:19 - is that when you click on say a tab
00:22 - that content expands
00:24 - and if you click on a different tab
00:27 - that content expands and it contracts
00:29 - the other or retracts the other content
00:33 - now typically this would be built in
00:36 - jquery or javascript but the fun thing
00:39 - about this is that this is built
00:40 - exclusively in css3 now there is a
00:43 - little bit of a limitation here and
00:45 - perhaps i challenge you to find a way
00:46 - around it with exclusive css3
00:50 - when you open an accordion item
00:54 - if i click on this item again
00:56 - it doesn't close it
00:58 - and that is because of the limitation of
01:01 - using css in this case perhaps that's
01:03 - not a big issue for you if you want to
01:05 - leave all of the content open at once
01:09 - perhaps there's a different work around
01:11 - but the way that we build it today it's
01:13 - quite simple and it will allow you to
01:16 - build an accordion very quickly in your
01:18 - own websites displaying content
01:20 - displaying services or whatever it is
01:22 - that you want to use for an accordion so
01:25 - let's jump in and get started over here
01:27 - in my code editor i have day number 23
01:30 - css3 accordion opened up
01:32 - give yourself a moment to download those
01:34 - and open it up in your favorite code
01:36 - editor and
01:38 - then open up your index and sandbox.css
01:41 - of course as always final.css is
01:43 - available for your reference
01:46 - and let me show you the
01:48 - index.html first this is the markup in
01:50 - our sandbox here
01:52 - under the level 4 heading we have a div
01:54 - of the class of accordion and then a div
01:56 - with the class in within that of
01:58 - accordion double underscore item
02:01 - and then we have an a tag
02:04 - with an href
02:07 - that that navigates to an anchor tab one
02:10 - and then a class a couple classes in
02:12 - fact simply for styling
02:15 - and then we have a div with the idea of
02:17 - tab one and the class of accordion
02:19 - content and then there's two other
02:21 - identical setups just with tab two and
02:24 - tab three now what happens here is when
02:25 - we click this
02:27 - this link
02:28 - it navigates the browser down to this so
02:31 - it's an anchor and then it navigates it
02:33 - down to this div so this is looking for
02:35 - tab one the id of tab one it pops down
02:37 - to tab one and you can see that when you
02:39 - just click on the base
02:42 - mark up here so if i click on accordion
02:43 - one it pops to that content right there
02:46 - according to it pops to that content
02:48 - coordinating three pops to that content
02:49 - and that's the default functionality in
02:51 - the final version it doesn't do that
02:53 - we're going to be using that
02:55 - as a way to
02:58 - animate and display this content so
03:00 - that's how the markup is set up let's
03:02 - jump into our sandbox and get styling
03:05 - now a lot of this styling is going to be
03:08 - just
03:09 - i guess cosmetic the functionality of
03:12 - hiding and showing it is actually quite
03:13 - simple and you'll see that in a moment
03:15 - but we're going to make it look a little
03:16 - bit better because why not so let's
03:19 - style just accordion
03:22 - position relative display block
03:25 - background color we're going to make it
03:27 - white
03:28 - and then border
03:30 - solid 1 pixel and then to go e-o-e-o-e-o
03:34 - all right so now we're going to say
03:35 - accordion
03:36 - double underscore item
03:38 - display block and that means we're
03:40 - styling this entire item here so it's
03:43 - this
03:44 - whole
03:45 - piece so there's the accordion which
03:46 - wraps everything then there's accordion
03:48 - item which wraps the entire item within
03:50 - there and then there's more elements
03:53 - so we're going to display that block and
03:55 - we're going to say accordion
03:59 - and then accordion
04:02 - content
04:04 - and then we're gonna go display block
04:08 - padding zero
04:10 - height this is important zero we're
04:12 - hiding it
04:14 - and we're gonna say overflow
04:17 - hidden so we're hiding any of the
04:19 - overflow because there will be an
04:20 - overflow when we say height zero the
04:22 - element is going to contract the element
04:24 - is going to have zero height but the
04:25 - text should
04:27 - we'll be overflowing outside of that
04:28 - element so we want to hide that content
04:31 - when it overflows outside of its height
04:35 - and then we're going to say transition
04:38 - we're just going to transition the
04:39 - height
04:40 - 0.5 seconds
04:42 - ease and we're also going to transition
04:44 - the padding
04:45 - at 0.3 seconds and linear
04:48 - because why not let's just see what that
04:50 - does once we get to it
04:52 - so if we save that and check it out you
04:54 - can see now that we're starting to
04:58 - show that uh you know we're hiding the
05:00 - content and we're starting to get some
05:01 - base styles here so let's make it look a
05:03 - bit nicer
05:06 - um we're going to select the accordion
05:09 - and then the accordion content
05:12 - and the paragraphs within there we're
05:14 - just going to give the whole paragraph
05:17 - a padding of 20 pixels and zero margin
05:21 - very simple we don't need to review that
05:22 - style then we're going to select the
05:24 - accordion
05:26 - the accordion content
05:29 - and then
05:31 - target so what this means
05:33 - is when we click on this a
05:36 - with the
05:37 - target or the anchor
05:39 - whatever you want to call it let's call
05:41 - it target of tab one it's looking for
05:44 - this so this is the target element
05:47 - of this once we click here so we're
05:49 - going to style
05:51 - this when that
05:53 - action is performed is essentially what
05:55 - that's saying because if i were just to
05:57 - style this it's just going to style the
05:59 - content when i do this
06:00 - it's actually going to match it once
06:03 - it's been a target of that click and
06:05 - you'll see how that works
06:07 - we're going to say height 150 pixels so
06:10 - a hard-coded height so it's going to
06:14 - go to that height right now it's at zero
06:17 - accordion content is when we click that
06:19 - link and now it's we're basically
06:22 - activating this the selector the target
06:25 - it's going to actually make that height
06:27 - 150 pixels and because we have a
06:29 - transition on the height
06:31 - it's going to
06:32 - animate down let's just see if that
06:34 - works
06:37 - so there we go i'm clicking on
06:38 - coordinating one two and three
06:41 - and so really we just made the accordion
06:43 - it's done that functionality has is
06:45 - complete you can see how quite quite
06:47 - simple that was however i want to make
06:48 - this look nice and use a few more
06:50 - minutes just to make this a little bit
06:52 - more pretty
06:54 - so let's style the
06:56 - accordion and then the accordion
07:00 - trigger
07:03 - we're going to say text decoration none
07:06 - so that's the link we're going to remove
07:07 - that text decoration so it doesn't
07:09 - really look like a link
07:10 - we're going to select the accordion and
07:12 - then the accordion
07:16 - title
07:18 - position relative
07:21 - display block
07:24 - margin 0 padding 10 pixels
07:28 - font size 1m
07:31 - background color or background
07:34 - double 0
07:35 - b3 b4
07:40 - color
07:41 - white
07:42 - border solid one pixel
07:45 - three seven
07:47 - nine double a four
07:50 - let's see what that looks like so far so
07:52 - that's gonna be that whole title there
07:53 - we go so we've got that teal color in
07:55 - the background with a border but i want
07:57 - to make it look a little bit more
07:58 - three-dimensional
08:00 - in each of those elements so we're gonna
08:02 - do that with some box shadow so i'm
08:04 - gonna say box shadow
08:07 - zero one pixel zero
08:11 - rgba
08:13 - two five five two five five two five
08:15 - five
08:16 - and then zero point five and then inset
08:20 - so save that if i left it at that it
08:22 - would look a little bit like this so
08:23 - we've got that white
08:25 - highlight at the very top as if there's
08:27 - a light source shining down from the top
08:29 - angle but i also want more to it i want
08:32 - to
08:34 - give a
08:35 - um
08:37 - let me see here
08:38 - i want to have a border on the bottom
08:40 - and
08:41 - around it so there's actually going to
08:43 - be quite a bit more here so let's put a
08:45 - comma here you can add more box shadows
08:47 - within the same
08:49 - value within the same after the property
08:51 - you can add multiple
08:52 - values
08:54 - 0 negative 1 pixels
08:58 - 0 rgb a
09:01 - 255 255 255 and 0.1
09:06 - and also inset
09:08 - so that
09:10 - will look a little bit like this
09:12 - well you can't even really see it let's
09:13 - just make it
09:15 - a hard-coded like
09:17 - yellow so you can see where that is
09:20 - so down here
09:22 - we're going to have
09:24 - another
09:25 - highlight down at the bottom so let's
09:27 - change it back to 255 and and if i made
09:30 - it a little bit more visible
09:32 - you'd see the white line at the bottom
09:34 - now we don't really like that i want it
09:36 - more subtle so maybe let's try something
09:38 - like i think
09:39 - 0.1 is good
09:41 - super super subtle just adds a little
09:43 - bit of depth to it a little bit of a of
09:45 - a highlight at the bottom
09:48 - remember the light source looks like
09:49 - it's coming from the top so i don't want
09:50 - to confuse your eyes and have
09:53 - multiple light sources i guess it
09:54 - doesn't matter it's up to you
09:56 - but now i'm going to say another comma
09:57 - zero four pixels zero and then three
10:00 - three eight
10:02 - eight nine four that's gonna be a shadow
10:05 - on the outside
10:07 - at the bottom of the
10:09 - title there so it's a thick
10:11 - darker
10:12 - line now the reason why we did this
10:14 - previous one this gentle highlight is to
10:17 - give a little bit of depth to that
10:20 - thick shadow on the bottom so it looks
10:21 - like it's a box coming out
10:25 - and
10:26 - you can see if i made that just a little
10:27 - bit lighter
10:29 - you could see that line there now that
10:32 - doesn't look as good
10:34 - so
10:35 - i kind of still like my original
10:36 - decision of 0.1 super subtle
10:40 - cool
10:41 - all right now the next one we're going
10:43 - to do one more box shadow zero four
10:47 - pixels two pixels
10:49 - rg ba
10:52 - zero zero zero zero point
10:55 - five
10:56 - and that was going to give us a shadow
10:58 - around the element altogether
11:01 - so each of them kind of just pop
11:04 - now we're going to do is when we hover
11:06 - there's more to it here so we're going
11:07 - to say
11:08 - accordion
11:10 - accordion
11:13 - double underscore title and then hover
11:16 - we're going to say background
11:18 - color
11:19 - is going to be oh bb
11:22 - fc0
11:24 - that will look a little bit like this so
11:25 - it just highlights a little bit nice
11:27 - usability
11:29 - little feature there
11:30 - now we're gonna do one last thing just a
11:33 - couple more styles here i want an arrow
11:36 - at the far right hand side now instead
11:38 - of going to photoshop and creating one
11:39 - and then creating a retina version of it
11:41 - and all that sort of stuff we just want
11:42 - this done in css we want it done quickly
11:45 - and we're just going to use a convention
11:47 - that we've already used in past videos
11:50 - of using borders to create a triangle
11:55 - okay
11:56 - so let's say accordion
11:59 - and then accordion
12:01 - title
12:04 - after
12:07 - and now we're going to say position
12:09 - absolute
12:11 - of course it needs to be content empty
12:13 - string
12:14 - we're going to give it a
12:18 - let's see right of 20 pixels so in 20
12:22 - pixels from the right the width is gonna
12:25 - be seven pixels
12:26 - height seven pixels so pretty small
12:28 - arrow
12:30 - border left
12:31 - two pixels a solid two pixels
12:35 - white
12:36 - border bottom
12:38 - solid two pixels white
12:42 - let's see what that looks like so far
12:44 - okay so we've just got the left side
12:47 - the left border and the bottom border of
12:49 - a square now as you can see all we need
12:51 - to do is just rotate it a little bit
12:54 - 45 degrees
12:56 - and then position it a little bit
12:58 - down
13:00 - in the center vertically we're just
13:01 - going to say transform and rotate
13:05 - and negative 45 degrees that will
13:08 - bring it
13:09 - counterclockwise that's right that's
13:11 - what we want
13:12 - save that
13:13 - there we go that looks amazing and now
13:17 - we need that to be down further so we're
13:20 - going to use the
13:21 - we're going to go top so up here in your
13:23 - right we're going to say top if i said
13:25 - 50
13:26 - it's going to
13:28 - be too far
13:30 - because it's 50 from the top
13:32 - of the border
13:34 - which is actually like right
13:36 - up here so this whole thing is about
13:38 - this size so it's actually 50 from i
13:41 - think it looks like it's 50 from there
13:43 - yeah so 50 percent from there actually
13:46 - and we need it up
13:48 - probably about
13:50 - seven
13:52 - maybe let's try let's do this calc
13:55 - because we want fifty percent
13:57 - and
13:58 - a pixel value so let's try that minus
14:00 - seven pixels so it looks like it's too
14:03 - far up
14:05 - so i want to bring it down just a bit
14:07 - more so say five pixels
14:09 - that looks centered to me that's it
14:11 - there's our css3 accordion right there
14:14 - and now it should work just fine there's
14:17 - your css3 accordion
14:19 - uh like i said a lot of this was
14:20 - cosmetic we're just playing around with
14:21 - the styles but that's what css is for
14:23 - after all uh the functionality of
14:26 - displaying the content using that target
14:30 - selector was quite simple it's just a
14:33 - few lines of css and that's it to create
14:35 - a css3 accordion
14:37 - i hope this gave you some ideas for your
14:39 - own websites applications and so on and
14:42 - so forth thanks for joining me in day
14:43 - number 23 hang tight day number 24 is
14:46 - coming at you tomorrow bye now
