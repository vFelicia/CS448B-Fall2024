00:00 - everybody we're going to get started
00:01 - momentarily
00:04 - and
00:06 - you could say hi in the chat
00:08 - which i have on the screen here
00:12 - i'll be the first to say hi
00:16 - okay i guess i wasn't
00:18 - hello
00:21 - ali
00:24 - and like i mentioned in case you're just
00:25 - filtering in we're gonna get started
00:27 - here in a minute or two hello quincy
00:31 - founder of free code camp
00:36 - emery hello
00:41 - muhammad
00:42 - sudeep i i'm just
00:44 - i'm terrible at these names
00:48 - all right here they come
00:55 - craig mullins with a verified check mark
00:59 - hello everybody
01:06 - hello hello hello all right
01:09 - so while everybody's getting filtered in
01:11 - um i will go ahead and start the
01:13 - introduction first i'm gary simon i've
01:15 - been a ui ux designer and front-end
01:17 - developer for the last 20-plus years
01:20 - i've been an instructor in teaching
01:22 - for the last 10 years and
01:25 - this is the third of the three streams
01:28 - that we've had scheduled uh for myself
01:31 - to stream a live ui ux review show here
01:35 - at free code camp on the youtube channel
01:37 - so perhaps we'll do this again sometime
01:38 - in the future but basically what we're
01:40 - doing is you are submitting your ui
01:43 - designs
01:44 - and i'm reviewing them live here all
01:47 - right so i already have a few picked out
01:49 - but you do that
01:50 - on twitter and you just use the hashtag
01:53 - live ui ux review and i may get you to
01:57 - yours i may not but still there's value
02:00 - even if i don't get to yours because a
02:02 - lot of people make the same mistakes and
02:04 - we can all learn from from each other of
02:06 - course
02:07 - um and so this is uh just a real quick
02:09 - plug uh designcourse.com i'm going to be
02:12 - we're actively working on this and it's
02:14 - going to be the most comprehensive
02:17 - that's my goal at least the most
02:18 - comprehensive
02:20 - service for learning ui ux design um so
02:23 - that's coming in several months time if
02:24 - you want to be notified when that's i
02:26 - released go ahead and enter your email
02:28 - here at designcourse.com and then
02:30 - secondly my youtube channel i right here
02:34 - it's design course it's linked here in
02:36 - the youtube description of this video um
02:38 - so yeah let's go ahead and get started
02:42 - so here's one that i
02:43 - chose
02:45 - this is a levi landing page with gsap
02:49 - all right so if you people don't know
02:51 - what gsap is gsap is an acronym for the
02:54 - green sock animation platform it allows
02:57 - you to do
02:58 - uh more complex
03:00 - animations
03:02 - rather than just using something like
03:03 - straight up css animations um so notice
03:06 - how everything comes in sequentially
03:08 - gsap makes this very easy to do in the
03:11 - front end development process it's
03:13 - javascript library it's very powerful i
03:15 - have several courses on it on my own
03:17 - youtube channel so you can definitely
03:18 - check that out to learn how to do this
03:20 - sort of thing so this is a
03:23 - a nice design overall a there's nothing
03:25 - i can't scroll a lot of this doesn't
03:27 - work so kind of what you see is what you
03:29 - get here um and in terms of the ui
03:32 - design itself
03:34 - i really like it um
03:36 - it's it's unique it's interesting um i
03:39 - don't think see anything that really is
03:41 - coming out as being
03:42 - uh negative with this one um it's using
03:46 - some modern ui design techniques like uh
03:49 - having kind of like this vertical
03:51 - bar over here
03:53 - um the whole circular navigation up here
03:57 - assuming this were ever to be finished
03:59 - so yeah i i like it
04:02 - i can't really say anything negative for
04:03 - what it is
04:04 - so also as a part of these live streams
04:07 - i do um i ask
04:09 - everybody watching here in the youtube
04:11 - chat to give it a rating
04:13 - one being the worst and 10 being the
04:15 - best you have about 15 seconds and then
04:16 - we'll see if i agree with you or not
04:19 - so go ahead and do that
04:21 - one being the worst 10 being the best
04:23 - consider the ui design any ux potential
04:26 - issues you see and factor that into your
04:28 - result
04:37 - somebody's already given it a 10 no he
04:39 - said eight
04:42 - well let's see if this is responsive
04:43 - first of all we could check that out
04:46 - no not quite
04:47 - just kind of made it for desktop
04:59 - should always learn css first and then
05:02 - try to use gsap for your animation
05:03 - purposes
05:05 - okay i'm going to go ahead i'm going to
05:07 - give this one for what it is
05:10 - a straight up
05:16 - 8.1
05:19 - yeah there we go
05:21 - all right i think it's pretty solid okay
05:25 - next one i have picked out
05:30 - all right so sort of a cool
05:32 - loading animation we saw here let's
05:34 - refresh that
05:37 - very cool
05:38 - um
05:39 - the thing that i notice right off the
05:41 - bat that is an issue is the lack of
05:44 - white space or the too much white space
05:46 - here so this isn't necessarily a white
05:48 - space issue it's an alignment issue this
05:51 - block right here which is comprised of
05:53 - this headline this sub headline and this
05:56 - call to action should all be pushed down
05:59 - considerably so
06:00 - when i say that we're going to give this
06:02 - like a margin top
06:04 - of
06:07 - i don't know
06:08 - 5 m units there we go so now we have
06:10 - almost an equal amount of white space
06:13 - from the top and bottom and now it looks
06:15 - in
06:16 - it's it's quite a bit better i would
06:18 - also probably make this right here
06:21 - a little bit less width um maybe put in
06:24 - on the next line right here that way it
06:26 - gives it a little bit more white space
06:28 - between this element and this element i
06:30 - really like the
06:32 - uh illustration here it being animated
06:35 - like this
06:36 - uh so this makes sense has like you
06:38 - little skeleton ui windows so it's
06:40 - always
06:41 - a good idea to use illustrations that
06:43 - are relevant based on the purpose of the
06:44 - landing page and the surface itself um
06:50 - let's okay up here we have
06:52 - a light and dark mode
06:54 - i kind of don't like this one because
06:55 - you're not sure which one is cho is
06:58 - really chosen yeah this is light version
07:00 - obviously but it should be a little bit
07:02 - more obvious like this should be filled
07:03 - in here perhaps already by default
07:05 - and sometimes to me
07:08 - i wasn't even sure what this was
07:10 - at a glance i thought it was like a
07:11 - chocolate chip cookie
07:13 - but just the moon
07:14 - but look checking this out anyhow
07:17 - this is pretty good um just for
07:20 - how everything reacts
07:22 - when you're switching from light to dark
07:26 - all right coming down one thing i do
07:29 - want to say is this this section right
07:31 - here this container because it's a very
07:33 - very subtle difference
07:35 - from this white to this very light
07:38 - desaturated sort of blue
07:40 - i think it's not enough contrast i think
07:42 - we needed to just maybe
07:44 - a little bit make that a tad bit darker
07:46 - so
07:47 - you can see it's almost white up here in
07:49 - the color picker so if we come down just
07:51 - a little bit
07:52 - i think that's better
07:54 - so now we can clearly see the separation
07:56 - of these two
07:58 - you know this this section up here which
08:00 - is traditionally called the hero section
08:02 - and then this section right here so i
08:04 - would say the same thing about this
08:06 - section over here same color you'd want
08:08 - to change it to up here so you have a
08:10 - more of a distinction between these
08:11 - containers so if i refresh it you'll see
08:13 - the original
08:15 - and it just kind of makes it a little
08:16 - bit harder to see the card
08:18 - and
08:19 - this section being separated itself this
08:22 - i really like this section right here um
08:24 - everything is
08:25 - is i aligned correctly there's a good
08:29 - white space the topography is good
08:31 - there's a good visual hierarchy which is
08:33 - reinforced by the fact that you know
08:34 - your different pieces of
08:36 - type
08:37 - are
08:38 - um
08:39 - changed and
08:41 - they're separated with each other to
08:42 - create that hierarchy through
08:45 - uh the font weight
08:46 - through the font size and
08:49 - contrast between these elements so those
08:52 - three things will really give you good
08:53 - topography if you understand how to
08:55 - apply them so and this is all pretty
08:57 - solid i like the icons they're simple
09:02 - this here again
09:04 - you could probably on it on a large
09:07 - viewport like this
09:08 - put in three or four
09:11 - of these um
09:13 - in a
09:14 - different columns so three instead of
09:16 - just having two because that really
09:17 - makes them really large i'd probably put
09:19 - at least three
09:21 - when you're out here in the larger
09:24 - viewports
09:26 - but other than that this is all solid i
09:29 - like the the type inside
09:31 - we're using labels on your forum that's
09:34 - excellent
09:35 - you should always have a contact form on
09:37 - your site don't just put your email
09:38 - address like a mail to link or something
09:41 - i always have a form
09:43 - that people can contact you with but i
09:45 - would also say always give them a way to
09:47 - email that you if they wish instead of
09:49 - using your form so offer both
09:51 - you want to give them as many ways to
09:53 - contact you as possible this is solid
09:55 - though so i what do you think this
09:57 - person should get for a rating for their
10:00 - portfolio one being the worst 10 the
10:02 - best i think the biggest issue was just
10:03 - this area right here too much white
10:05 - space get that centered here vertically
10:14 - oh we got a
10:18 - chat thank you for that
10:20 - which goes to free code camp
10:31 - one being the worst 10 mean the best get
10:33 - your
10:37 - answers in
10:46 - is another high higher rated entry
10:49 - for sure
10:50 - so for me
10:52 - i'm going to go ahead and give this one
11:00 - and
11:02 - 8.3
11:04 - or so
11:05 - i i notice so there's a lot of eights
11:07 - there's a lot of nines there's some
11:08 - sevens
11:11 - so yeah pretty pretty solid
11:15 - quincy says seven he wasn't as impressed
11:17 - okay
11:19 - all right
11:20 - next up is going to be an adobe xd
11:23 - prototype
11:28 - all right so what we have here
11:30 - is digital marketing agency um
11:34 - there's several areas that we can click
11:36 - one thing just about the topography i
11:38 - like the colors um
11:40 - this seems to be a good font size this
11:42 - is the mont cigarette type of uh font
11:45 - family which
11:46 - i know because i use forever and i still
11:48 - use um i think a little bit more line
11:51 - height it's a little bit scrunched up in
11:52 - my opinion um
11:54 - so i would increase the line height just
11:56 - a bit
11:56 - um
11:57 - outside of that
11:59 - pretty solid uh call to action here
12:03 - so adobe xd has the ability to animate
12:05 - on hover
12:06 - um
12:09 - i'm not sure if i would increase the
12:11 - size of these honestly on hover
12:14 - but uh nonetheless your alignment's good
12:16 - you notice you're in the the very first
12:18 - link the home nav
12:19 - uh defines a column here and then right
12:23 - along this column is the rest of this
12:25 - content and that that creates a nice
12:27 - uniform consistent layout it just makes
12:29 - it look better um
12:31 - one thing i don't like is that me our
12:33 - team button
12:35 - the the gray the mid gray right here
12:36 - it's very hard to to use mid gray
12:38 - effectively in the ui design um in this
12:41 - button here being blue
12:43 - it doesn't contrast very well so i would
12:45 - change this color to
12:48 - to something else you could either go
12:50 - light
12:50 - i probably wouldn't make it this blue
12:52 - color because then it competes
12:54 - uh for your your primary call to action
12:58 - so i would use maybe a really dark maybe
13:00 - very you know almost as dark as this for
13:03 - the background here
13:05 - next up looking at this area this area
13:08 - it's designed well like the cards it has
13:10 - good white space inside
13:13 - however
13:14 - it's a little bit confusing um because
13:17 - you've chosen to emphasize a few over
13:19 - the others and i'm not sure if that's
13:22 - necessarily what you wanted to do um so
13:25 - sometimes also i don't know what these
13:27 - little dots are for it almost makes me
13:29 - think like there might be some sort of
13:30 - weird inner navigation within this this
13:33 - card so it's kind of confusing
13:35 - um but i would probably opt just to
13:37 - style them all the same unless there's
13:39 - some type of reason that you want to
13:40 - emphasize one or the other over the
13:42 - other
13:44 - next up this is this
13:46 - right here is pretty solid
13:52 - and this is kind of quite bordery or
13:55 - lining if you will
13:56 - you could probably either drop
13:59 - the uh
14:01 - significantly on the border you know
14:03 - making it just a very dark gray or you
14:05 - could get rid of the border entirely and
14:07 - make the background of this card i just
14:11 - a little like a shade lighter than the
14:13 - background um that way it won't feel
14:15 - like so many lines it's fine here
14:18 - because you really want to emphasize
14:19 - this middle one but
14:21 - it becomes a little bit cluttered in my
14:22 - opinion with the extra borders
14:24 - and always make sure you're using labels
14:26 - so if you're these look like they would
14:28 - be placeholder values and you don't want
14:30 - to rely on those make sure they're
14:31 - floating
14:33 - good call to action here
14:35 - and yeah again same comments about this
14:37 - this mid gray all right what do you
14:39 - think this person should get rated one
14:41 - being the worst and 10 being the best
14:43 - you have about 15 seconds to get your
14:44 - answers in
14:49 - the font family
14:51 - for that one was monsterat
14:54 - which you can download that that's
14:55 - available for you
14:56 - google fonts
15:16 - i've been hitting the gym hard so i'm
15:18 - like i need to stretch i'm like
15:20 - very sore right now
15:22 - oh we got a lot of ratings that came in
15:24 - all the way
15:26 - all right so for me um based on what i
15:29 - see here
15:30 - it's it's overall this part's a little
15:32 - bit cluttered and misaligned um but
15:35 - overall it's pretty decent there's no
15:36 - significant issues here
15:38 - so i'm going to rate this
15:43 - uh like a 6.9 maybe even a 7 or so
15:48 - i think that's pretty fair based on
15:50 - what i've
15:52 - rated the other ones
15:54 - all right so let's do yet another one
16:00 - so we've been looking at some pretty
16:01 - decent uh entries up to this point so
16:04 - far
16:05 - um this one needs some work though a
16:07 - little bit more than the other ones
16:09 - so
16:10 - why do i say that well
16:12 - first of all the first issue that i
16:14 - notice here is
16:16 - alignment
16:18 - all right so
16:19 - we have this logo right here in the logo
16:22 - by the way there's too much type in that
16:24 - logo i'm not sure whoever created this
16:26 - if you have control over the logo which
16:29 - you might not because you're a ui or
16:32 - designer or you're a friend of developer
16:33 - whatever
16:34 - um there's just i would have it
16:35 - refactored there's just too much type
16:37 - occurring here outside of that though it
16:40 - creates a a a column here
16:43 - and it
16:44 - in in also in and of itself if we're
16:46 - just going to take a look at the nav bar
16:48 - which is which is the logo plus
16:50 - this
16:51 - navigation right here navigation is
16:53 - completely fluid all the way to the
16:55 - right of the browser and then this is
16:57 - just kind of pushed over like
17:00 - randomly if it's going to be really
17:01 - fluid then this should be pushed over
17:03 - all the way over here as well to create
17:05 - that nice symmetry
17:06 - um but
17:08 - one thing so we have that issue but then
17:10 - the next issue is you have this
17:13 - column defined by
17:15 - all the type right here so it's thrown
17:18 - off in a couple of different ways the
17:20 - best way to deal with this is to take
17:22 - this logo put it right here
17:25 - and then also take this navigation and
17:27 - put it
17:28 - the contact us should probably end right
17:31 - here and so it would go like this length
17:34 - and then if you're kind of worried about
17:36 - the navigation being a little bit too
17:38 - close at that point to the logo because
17:39 - it'll be moved here and this will be
17:41 - moved in the middle um you could expand
17:43 - the width of this this fixed container
17:46 - that's centered here at this resolution
17:48 - or this this eye
17:50 - viewport
17:52 - all right after that
17:55 - there's not a ton of contrast with this
17:58 - red
17:59 - and this background you can read it but
18:01 - when you get to this
18:03 - this area is pretty fine because it's
18:04 - dark but when you get over here to this
18:06 - table or whatever it is it it there's
18:08 - not you could have more contrast this
18:10 - could even possibly be white
18:13 - the way to fix that is multiple ways
18:15 - changing the color of the type on top
18:16 - like making it completely white or
18:19 - further
18:20 - taking this photograph and making it
18:23 - darker
18:24 - there's an issue also with your call to
18:26 - actions so we have three different
18:29 - buttons in this area
18:31 - call us send us a message in free
18:33 - estimate that are all
18:35 - designed in the same exact manner
18:38 - so that's a lack of visual hierarchy
18:41 - the free estimate button is probably
18:43 - going to be the one that's most
18:44 - important and the one that you want
18:46 - people to to click on so every every
18:48 - page should have a goal of some sort and
18:51 - this one clearly it would probably be to
18:54 - free us to get a free estimate also a
18:56 - free estimate i'm not sure
18:58 - what that entails verse call us
19:01 - i guess this is just the phone number
19:03 - and then to send us a message so
19:05 - if you want to have these buttons here
19:08 - make style them differently it's so that
19:10 - they don't catch as much attention from
19:12 - the eye that this one does this one
19:14 - should this is what you want people to
19:16 - use so style these differently
19:19 - i wouldn't use red as a background for
19:20 - these
19:21 - there's a lot of different ways you can
19:23 - do it to have secondary call to actions
19:25 - and also this kind of seems just
19:26 - misplaced i would place these maybe
19:28 - underneath the free estimate or to the
19:30 - right of the free estimate button
19:33 - outside of that
19:34 - this part's pretty decent right here
19:37 - in the middle
19:43 - there's nothing really a hundred percent
19:45 - wrong uh happening at
19:47 - basically
19:48 - for the most part everywhere else
19:50 - whenever you have two columns like this
19:52 - here's the left column and here's the
19:53 - right column i prefer to not center
19:56 - text that's in the right or left maybe
19:58 - just left align these elements and that
20:00 - way you really define this this this uh
20:04 - column right here outside of that that
20:07 - is it
20:09 - and it's uh there's just a few small
20:11 - things that could improve it what do you
20:12 - think this person should get for a
20:13 - rating one being the worst and 10 being
20:15 - the very best
20:24 - quincy asked i've heard the right number
20:27 - of call to actions is always one are
20:29 - there exceptions to that i think it
20:31 - depends on what
20:33 - you may define as a call to action so um
20:37 - if there should always be at least a
20:39 - primary call to action and if we're
20:41 - talking primary then by nature we're
20:43 - talking one so yes you'd be correct um
20:46 - in this case
20:47 - uh we we have a lot of secondary sort of
20:50 - call to actions if you will or
20:52 - you know areas that people could
20:54 - actually leave um and in that case they
20:56 - should be
20:58 - not styled as prominently as that
20:59 - primary one if that makes sense so for
21:01 - this one i'm going to go ahead and give
21:03 - this i mean there's not a lot of like
21:05 - horrible things happening here so for me
21:08 - i'm going to give this one like a
21:11 - a 6.2
21:13 - or so
21:20 - once he's uh says 5.5 i think he's just
21:23 - a little bit
21:25 - we're pretty much consistent in in our
21:27 - ratings though a little bit lower than
21:29 - what i'm writing
21:30 - all right i
21:36 - oh
21:38 - there we go
21:40 - 47roofconstruction.com
21:44 - all right so this this layout to me
21:47 - it feels dated it's uh it's like back in
21:49 - 2013 2014 2015 these are the type of
21:52 - like layouts that i saw often um it has
21:56 - the logo here and has like these little
21:59 - areas where
22:00 - you can have you know the
22:02 - access to to call the people there's
22:04 - also the address
22:06 - um we have a very standard
22:09 - um hero section with the centered
22:12 - area here and my dog is barking down
22:14 - there
22:15 - um
22:17 - having said that
22:20 - i guess you could you can maybe take
22:23 - a little bit of a point away
22:25 - just because it's dated however the
22:27 - things that we need to be
22:29 - most certain of is that
22:31 - the
22:32 - ui in the ux is working well so
22:35 - in that case
22:36 - i can't really say there's anything too
22:38 - wrong
22:39 - sorry my voice is cracking up
22:42 - about what i see here
22:45 - request a complimentary inspection today
22:48 - that's a good headline
22:50 - get in touch i would probably bold up
22:52 - the white because this green versus this
22:55 - white text you lose a little bit of
22:56 - contrast there so
22:58 - i might use it maybe a slightly darker
23:01 - green or
23:02 - bold up and make it a little bit larger
23:04 - this getting touch button
23:06 - where does a get in touch button do um
23:08 - is there a contact page
23:12 - unfortunately it's kind of a slow
23:13 - loading right now
23:16 - and it's not secure maybe this isn't
23:18 - live yet i'm not sure
23:20 - one of one of here's a tip if you ever
23:23 - want to increase your leads
23:24 - and this would be considered a lead if
23:26 - somebody contacts you using this contact
23:28 - form
23:29 - i would and you only have a few or a
23:32 - small amount of fields that you're
23:34 - requesting there's one of two things you
23:37 - could do you could just take this
23:38 - feel free to contact us page
23:41 - and you could put this in a right column
23:43 - and then left align this in the left
23:45 - column that way it's one less click
23:48 - that people have to to to to to do in
23:50 - order to get in touch with you
23:52 - uh especially if you have a server that
23:55 - this is being hosted on that's kind of
23:56 - slow because that took too much too long
23:58 - way too long to get to that page
24:00 - so you're gonna reduce your your bounce
24:03 - rate you're going to increase your
24:04 - amount of leads
24:06 - and the other way to approach it is
24:07 - maybe just if you have more fields than
24:09 - you're comfortable with putting you know
24:11 - in your hero section of the landing page
24:13 - then maybe just put one or two and then
24:15 - it will just take them to the next one
24:17 - because they're already invested i
24:19 - in filling out all the the information
24:22 - outside of that about us
24:25 - maybe a little bit more white space here
24:28 - we are insurance experts contact us yeah
24:32 - i mean this is all it's all pretty solid
24:34 - here i don't see anything that's that's
24:35 - coming out and just
24:37 - being completely wrong with exception to
24:39 - this area because they're only
24:40 - placeholder values we want to make this
24:42 - accessible so make sure you use the
24:44 - labels as always all right so
24:47 - one being the worst ten being the best
24:48 - what do you think this person should get
24:50 - for a rating
25:07 - some people are saying five five three
25:15 - i'm going to go ahead and say
25:19 - let's see let's see if at least
25:21 - if it's working responsibly and it is
25:31 - yeah so for me
25:33 - oh we agree this time
25:38 - i'm going to say
25:40 - maybe around 6.5 to like a 6.8
25:44 - or maybe even close to a seven now that
25:46 - i think about it
25:49 - yeah so pretty solid here
25:51 - all right
25:52 - um
25:54 - next up
25:56 - this is like an english learning app of
25:58 - some sort
26:00 - um it's a yeah english leading course
26:02 - center all right
26:04 - um
26:06 - by the way like if it's a template
26:08 - there's no way for me to know if it's a
26:10 - template or not um so i always just make
26:12 - the assumption that it's not a template
26:15 - um so okay
26:17 - first thing i think is a little strange
26:18 - is this this little settings cog like
26:20 - what does that do
26:22 - theme color
26:24 - oh interesting okay so they let you
26:26 - choose the theme here
26:29 - which on a landing page i'm not too
26:30 - certain makes that much sense to be
26:32 - honest with you
26:34 - um
26:35 - random background right bullet i mean
26:38 - it's cool to showcase that you can do
26:39 - this and you know how but i'm not sure
26:41 - if it makes sense on the landing page um
26:43 - the biggest issue here though when i
26:45 - check this out
26:47 - is
26:48 - the
26:49 - headline and the sub headline they're
26:51 - just really i they're they're boring in
26:54 - my opinion um this needs to be enlarged
26:56 - a lot especially in this viewport you
26:58 - know
26:59 - this right here i'm not the size is 2m i
27:02 - mean you could bump that up to like 6m
27:04 - uh or 5m units
27:07 - and
27:08 - that way it's already so much better so
27:10 - look at this scale so this is an issue
27:12 - of a ui design fundamental called scale
27:15 - the size of things it doesn't
27:16 - necessarily have to pertain just to
27:19 - type it could be anything
27:22 - but if i refresh this
27:24 - oh
27:26 - not cool you know so beef that size up
27:29 - considerably
27:31 - this is also lacking
27:33 - a call to action
27:35 - um you know at the very least
27:38 - if you want to tell people to scroll
27:39 - down go ahead and do that
27:41 - these up here i wouldn't call these
27:43 - really any any sorts of a primary call
27:46 - to action so same thing with this over
27:48 - here just kind of gets lost sometimes
27:49 - it's
27:50 - not immediately identifiable so you want
27:53 - to give somebody you know an area where
27:56 - you know they need to click and
27:58 - where they have to click that's up to
28:00 - you and that's a ux concern where is it
28:03 - that you want them to land
28:05 - first
28:08 - so just this is quite a long about us
28:10 - section
28:12 - i at the very least if you're going to
28:13 - keep all this text maybe use um two
28:16 - different paragraphs because it's kind
28:17 - of like a wall of text so peop people
28:20 - don't like reading that
28:22 - um
28:23 - this is these cards you gotta scrap
28:26 - those
28:26 - um
28:27 - in what by i mean scrap i mean you need
28:29 - to change up the design uh the borders
28:32 - plus the thick
28:34 - uh drop shadow makes it look amateur and
28:38 - dated
28:39 - so i mean i'll guarantee you right now i
28:42 - can fix these up
28:44 - the box shadow get rid of that so there
28:47 - we go we've already simplified it much
28:49 - more you add these back and it just
28:51 - looks cheesy so you don't need that um
28:54 - you could
28:56 - where's the border at um
28:58 - trying to find the border
29:04 - i'm not sure where the border property
29:06 - is defined here oh there it is
29:08 - if we get rid of that
29:09 - then
29:10 - we can use this box shadow but it's
29:12 - still the box shadow is still too strong
29:16 - you want to take the opacity which is at
29:18 - point 76
29:20 - um
29:22 - drop it down a lot
29:24 - like
29:26 - 0.2 and then we could probably increase
29:29 - um
29:31 - the blur reverse spread
29:34 - that's better that's a better take so
29:36 - there's
29:37 - when it comes to design ui design as
29:39 - well you know you have a certain amount
29:42 - of subjectivity or in other words
29:44 - personal preferences
29:46 - um so this is one way to take it
29:49 - but what one way i would not take it is
29:52 - this the original
29:57 - i'm not sure why this is
30:00 - you know really emphasized there
30:02 - otherwise if you if you styled it
30:03 - similarly to the rest it would look a
30:04 - lot better it kind of looks out of
30:06 - place and then this is a big issue here
30:09 - these are broken
30:10 - um the little
30:13 - uh circular
30:15 - pagination buttons are overlapping
30:18 - but yeah what do you think this person
30:19 - should get for a rating one being the
30:21 - worst and 10 being the best
30:24 - somebody asked why you should use a
30:26 - label instead of a placeholder the
30:28 - placeholder value
30:29 - when you start typing in that text field
30:31 - or the text area or whatever it's
30:34 - it automatically clears it and then some
30:38 - people may forget what they're entering
30:40 - um
30:41 - and so it becomes an accessibility issue
30:43 - so always having it in plain view makes
30:46 - sense
30:49 - this this definitely is not a one now
30:51 - i've seen ones before and i've rated a
30:53 - few ones this is this is this is higher
30:55 - than a one
30:57 - um
30:58 - but for me i'm gonna have to rate this
30:59 - maybe a little bit lower than normal let
31:02 - me see what it looks like responsively
31:05 - it is responsive
31:08 - so they're doing all that correct
31:17 - i'm going to go ahead and rate this one
31:19 - a
31:27 - about
31:28 - 5.8 or so 5.7
31:35 - all right
31:41 - all right um
31:44 - next up
31:45 - i had just two more that i had you know
31:47 - that i
31:48 - checked out
31:49 - beforehand
31:52 - this
31:53 - is there's a number of issues here with
31:55 - this one
31:56 - so
31:58 - scroll down
32:01 - the biggest issue with this this right
32:03 - here is a is a ux issue it's not even a
32:06 - ui design issue
32:07 - um you're not addressing and telling me
32:09 - what the purpose of the site is about
32:11 - why
32:12 - why do i have to scroll down why should
32:15 - i scroll down why would i want to scroll
32:18 - down
32:19 - people are going to leave this site
32:20 - quickly
32:22 - second
32:23 - i would say
32:25 - having these two
32:26 - navigations like this
32:28 - both encased in this high contrast white
32:31 - area um or this container rather that
32:34 - doesn't make sense
32:35 - um you're if you're gonna do this the
32:37 - navigation makes more sense to do that
32:40 - than this secondary
32:42 - uh and i mean secondary in terms of
32:44 - importance your social navigation so you
32:47 - know
32:48 - one way to fix that because that creates
32:49 - an issue of visual hierarchy is you can
32:51 - just take this
32:53 - and
32:54 - the background is white so what we can
32:56 - do is
32:57 - we'll change that background
33:00 - to just slightly lighter than
33:04 - this
33:06 - and then you would want to take these
33:07 - icons and make them all white and also
33:10 - get rid of this weird block this outer
33:12 - glow that you have
33:13 - and then that way
33:14 - things are kind of restored to normal so
33:17 - scroll down whoa
33:20 - i wasn't
33:21 - i wasn't expecting that initially i did
33:23 - see this before i started the stream but
33:25 - i didn't scroll down so if i start
33:26 - scrolling down things are really
33:28 - happening quickly
33:30 - oh no
33:31 - and if you're gonna do this sort of
33:32 - thing that better be a watermark in the
33:34 - background because now you have visual
33:36 - clutter all over the place
33:39 - you're lacking white space between these
33:41 - sections you don't want to stretch your
33:43 - images like that it does not look good
33:47 - you want to work on your type as well
33:49 - this almost looks like a comic sans
34:00 - i would get rid of this eye border
34:03 - completely unnecessary
34:06 - yeah we just have some issues here you
34:07 - know quite a bit of issues with
34:08 - topography
34:10 - these should be styled a little bit more
34:12 - differently from each other
34:17 - this would be a great example
34:19 - of somebody who could definitely
34:21 - benefit from checking out like my ui
34:23 - design courses i have several that are
34:26 - free on my youtube channel
34:28 - also you can check out skrinba.com i
34:30 - have a ui design bootcamp there
34:32 - because you kind of need to really just
34:34 - start from the beginning um and really
34:36 - learn your ui design fundamentals much
34:38 - more all right so we're going to go
34:40 - ahead and rate this one being the worst
34:42 - and 10 being the best
34:48 - number of ui issues uh ux issues as well
34:51 - so we got to factor those in this is a
34:54 - big no go absolutely not nobody can read
34:56 - this
34:58 - you don't want to have vertical text and
34:59 - paragraphs of vertical text you can get
35:01 - away with it if it's just tiny amounts
35:03 - of
35:04 - text
35:05 - i but when it comes to this no no no no
35:17 - i'm gonna have to give this one i'm
35:19 - looking at the ratings coming in
35:30 - yeah i'm gonna go ahead and give this
35:32 - one
35:34 - a
35:38 - 2.8 or so
35:41 - yeah i think that makes sense
35:44 - all right we have one more
35:46 - um that i i checked out beforehand and
35:49 - then we'll switch to twitter
35:52 - wow quincy gave it a four and i give it
35:54 - a 2.8
35:56 - all
35:56 - right all right so
35:59 - here's one of those issues and one of
36:01 - the dangers
36:03 - of
36:05 - trends design trends um being
36:09 - overused and maybe not being used
36:11 - correctly
36:12 - and that is at the start of this year i
36:14 - did a video about it it was really
36:16 - popular about a new design trend called
36:18 - neomorphism
36:20 - and you could see these buttons with
36:22 - their real soft appearing and stuff and
36:25 - people went crazy on twitter i mean on
36:26 - dribble i
36:28 - because it was really cool the person
36:30 - did it in a really good context for a
36:32 - user interface of an app um but as we
36:35 - could see these
36:37 - it's been applied here what knew more
36:39 - new morphism is
36:41 - is we could see like elements and
36:42 - containers have this light uh
36:46 - shadow over here
36:48 - done achieved through the box shadow
36:49 - property and you can have multiple block
36:51 - shadows and then the second one is just
36:53 - like a shot a darker shadow here and
36:56 - they're real soft
36:57 - but when you do this like on almost
36:59 - every element it just makes it look
37:02 - just too amateur in my opinion because
37:04 - it's very similar to your typical
37:06 - shadows that you've seen that were your
37:09 - drop shadows that we've seen for 20 plus
37:11 - years
37:12 - we have issues with alignment so we have
37:15 - this column that's here but then we have
37:16 - this slightly inset
37:19 - so that's not working out
37:21 - i do like
37:22 - the take though on
37:25 - light and dark mode
37:27 - um
37:28 - these could be okay so for your hot your
37:31 - the hover of these the contrast gets
37:33 - killed with this blue color you're using
37:35 - based on this mid sort of gray color
37:38 - here
37:39 - and another thing that kind of hurts it
37:40 - too is using this mid gray color it kind
37:42 - of just looks bland in my opinion
37:45 - so you need to think about that
37:48 - it looks like you're just taking people
37:49 - straight into your portfolio examples
37:52 - right here but it probably would be it
37:54 - would make sense at least to have a
37:55 - little section at the top that kind of
37:58 - describes
37:59 - what you are and you know what you do it
38:02 - does say front end web developer but
38:04 - you could probably expand on that a
38:06 - little bit more
38:07 - um
38:08 - in sort of like a hero section it
38:10 - doesn't have to be the 100 100 viewport
38:12 - height or whatever but just a section up
38:15 - top instead of just having people go
38:17 - straight hundred percent into your your
38:19 - uh projects
38:23 - all right so what do you think this
38:25 - person should get rated for
38:27 - their
38:29 - portfolio one being the worst in ten
38:30 - being the best
38:39 - let me go ahead and check and see how
38:40 - long we've been streaming
38:46 - all right
38:49 - 38 minutes ago
38:58 - okay try to be constructive by the way
39:06 - i mean if i showed you some of my
39:08 - first designs back in the late 90s yeah
39:12 - you would all die
39:14 - um i'm going to go ahead and give let's
39:16 - see if the let's check responsiveness
39:21 - it is responsive
39:23 - so for this
39:25 - i'm going to go ahead and give it
39:27 - something like around
39:29 - a
39:32 - i think a 4.5 or so would make sense
39:39 - all right now designing sites is not
39:41 - easy it's definitely a skill that has to
39:43 - be learned
39:45 - um
39:46 - in fact
39:47 - let me do something real quick i'm going
39:49 - to take a
39:51 - a little bit of a detour
39:54 - and i'm going to go to my
39:56 - youtube channel
39:58 - and i'm going to go to
40:02 - my search my channel search i'm going to
40:05 - type 1999.
40:07 - here it is lol i found my old design
40:10 - work from 1999 so this is going to make
40:13 - a lot of you feel better
40:15 - if you watch this video
40:17 - um
40:19 - and this is when i put this out about
40:21 - three years ago this video
40:22 - and if i i'm going to scroll just to
40:24 - show you some of my designs back in
40:28 - like there are some that are from 1998 i
40:31 - think
40:32 - um and you're going to see some of my
40:33 - designs like that was my portfolio look
40:36 - at that
40:37 - this was i when i was
40:39 - i created a lot of portfolios like
40:42 - that's almost all of my work comprised
40:45 - of was
40:46 - like that's how i got practice by by
40:48 - making a million portfolios um designs
40:51 - like look at this my skills
40:53 - flash three four i have three years
40:56 - experience html dhtml
40:58 - java
41:00 - i never mess with java i don't know why
41:02 - i even put that maybe i meant javascript
41:05 - mysql php
41:07 - visual basic
41:08 - i was one of those horrible people who
41:12 - created aol apps or they were called
41:14 - progs back then or progs for like
41:18 - kicking people offline and stuff like
41:19 - punters and stuff um but that's kind of
41:22 - how i learned to code um
41:24 - but yeah just looking through this i'm
41:26 - looking
41:27 - there's a lot i mean look at this
41:30 - now get
41:31 - you have to remember look at that you
41:33 - have to remember that this was this is
41:35 - actually i was really proud of this one
41:36 - it was really unique back then
41:38 - um
41:40 - this is one of my first portfolios right
41:41 - here
41:43 - hi my name is gary simon i'm 16 years
41:46 - old and i live in warren ohio i mean can
41:48 - you imagine this i mean so yeah i mean
41:51 - this is all learned stuff then i started
41:53 - to get better
41:55 - eventually oh this i was showing uh
41:57 - slicing which was a front-end
41:58 - development technique
42:00 - way back a long time ago
42:04 - so i i got you know quite a bit better
42:06 - as
42:07 - you know
42:08 - i kept practicing all right
42:11 - so now let's keep on uh now we're gonna
42:14 - switch gears and i'm not gonna i'm gonna
42:16 - take uh doing reviews that i haven't
42:18 - seen yet so
42:20 - um let's go to twitter
42:23 - and we're going to search for
42:26 - live ui ux
42:31 - review
42:35 - latest
42:38 - you got a speeding ticket more in ohio
42:40 - yep so did i
42:43 - all right so let's just check some of
42:45 - these out i'm going to try to avoid
42:46 - prototypes i want to do live
42:49 - websites
42:51 - i'm going to move them off
42:57 - all right so here's one
43:01 - all right
43:03 - so okay
43:05 - welcome to david's portfolio this page
43:07 - is being tested on different devices as
43:09 - of september 15 2020 you may continue
43:14 - huge ux issue don't do this
43:16 - nobody cares if you're you're testing it
43:19 - on different devices like this is this
43:21 - should be assumed so
43:23 - don't do that
43:25 - let them go to your main user interface
43:29 - and this is one of those things i
43:31 - where
43:33 - someone in your shoes if you're the
43:35 - person who created this or if you're
43:36 - somebody creating things like this
43:38 - definitely go back to the drawing board
43:40 - when it comes to ui design watch my my
43:43 - crash courses on my channel
43:46 - i have ui ux design crash courses and
43:49 - front end development crash courses as
43:52 - well because there's just too many
43:53 - things that are happening here for me to
43:55 - sit here and try to give this a
43:57 - comprehensive review
43:58 - um
43:59 - so
44:00 - yeah there's a lot of things that you
44:01 - shouldn't be doing here like the borders
44:03 - are over the place the strong drop
44:05 - shadows this is all just stuff that's
44:07 - very dated and it's been quite a
44:09 - you know
44:10 - the yeah the the shadows everywhere for
44:13 - some reason
44:14 - new ui designers they get excited and in
44:17 - front of developers and they want to use
44:19 - all the cool effects but it's not it's a
44:22 - hindrance try to keep things more simple
44:25 - eye
44:26 - than not so
44:28 - for this one just because there's
44:30 - there's there's so much that needs to be
44:32 - improved we're not even going to bother
44:33 - with a rating let's just move on to
44:35 - another one thank you for the submission
44:37 - though
44:40 - let's see here
44:41 - we got a netlify app one
44:46 - now this to me looks like a a template
44:48 - sorted design but again i don't like
44:50 - making the assumption that
44:52 - these are templates um
44:55 - cosse
44:58 - all right pretty solid here but you know
45:00 - when you get out to these
45:02 - large
45:04 - one second here when you get out to
45:06 - these larger
45:07 - uh resolution like this is 4k right here
45:10 - um it just seems like it's a little bit
45:12 - too stretched out like it might make
45:14 - sense to take this nav
45:17 - net this nav bar here and create and
45:19 - make it into a
45:20 - fixed centered container kind of like
45:22 - how
45:23 - this is right here
45:25 - outside of that it's simple
45:28 - i mean it's ultra simple
45:32 - i like the little um
45:34 - this type of uh
45:37 - gallery right here
45:40 - like the masonry
45:41 - gallery style
45:43 - this is all pretty
45:45 - pretty decent looking
45:47 - i don't really have an issue with this
45:50 - yeah this is a great example of a really
45:52 - simple
45:53 - design
45:55 - that i it works well though has all the
45:57 - ui design fundamentals there we have
45:59 - good contrast we have good white space
46:02 - we have good alignment for the most part
46:05 - uh good visual hierarchy
46:08 - so i can't really say anything too wrong
46:10 - uh this right here though that's
46:13 - you need more line height for sure on
46:15 - that
46:16 - i probably want to use a better ad copy
46:19 - for this a spring sale of 30 that
46:22 - doesn't i would put that as like a
46:23 - subtitle but then use something that's
46:26 - completely different above that so one
46:28 - being the worst tammy and the best what
46:30 - do you people think this person should
46:31 - get for a rating
46:40 - i already know what i'm going to rate it
46:56 - yeah
46:57 - for me i'm going to give this a
47:00 - let's see here
47:05 - 7.8 or so
47:11 - yeah i think that's fair i mean again
47:13 - when i say 7.8 you know this could be
47:17 - depending on when you ask me like we
47:19 - could have
47:20 - like a three-tenths variation one way or
47:22 - the other
47:24 - let's check out some more
47:29 - 360
47:30 - magnet solutions so i'm always moving
47:33 - these off just to make sure
47:35 - that there are designs that i can
47:37 - present
47:40 - all right okay
47:42 - i was getting i was getting a little bit
47:43 - worried because i i was
47:45 - i was what we were like almost 50
47:48 - minutes into this i think
47:50 - yeah 47 minutes um and we didn't have
47:52 - any of these uh
47:54 - the whole crazy vector
47:57 - animated designs occurring
47:59 - all right so the first issue with this
48:02 - design
48:03 - is this image right here for one
48:06 - it's pixelated it's a photograph so you
48:09 - should
48:10 - never use
48:12 - type
48:13 - baked into photographs like jpegs or
48:15 - pngs or whatever
48:17 - this is meant to be red easily
48:20 - and it's just not working here so if
48:22 - you're going to use a photograph make
48:23 - sure it's of like
48:24 - non-typography things second
48:27 - the type is just really large and it's
48:30 - suffering from a lack of white space
48:32 - and it's really spread out so
48:34 - i would just if you're going to use this
48:36 - this uh
48:38 - design right here or this photograph
48:39 - rather get rid of the type
48:41 - in the image
48:43 - leave this white background here and
48:44 - then just use html to put the the images
48:47 - on top
48:48 - um
48:50 - baking the type into the
48:53 - image or the photograph that's something
48:55 - that we used to do back during the
48:56 - slicing days sometimes
48:59 - you don't want to do that now
49:01 - outside of that
49:04 - this right here the animations
49:06 - completely unnecessary they're they're
49:08 - distracting so i remove that even though
49:11 - it's cool
49:12 - it's just not it serves no purpose
49:16 - outside here
49:17 - the next section
49:19 - yeah
49:20 - you're having issues with alignment
49:22 - because the bottom of this
49:23 - it's wrapping around this image but
49:25 - really this whole
49:27 - left portion should be maintained uh
49:30 - because it's just throwing off the flow
49:32 - of the type
49:33 - you also have quite a bit of type here
49:35 - i'm not sure if everybody
49:38 - or most people will want to read through
49:39 - all this so you might benefit by
49:41 - reducing the amount of type here also
49:45 - the type is a little bit screwed up
49:47 - because you have you have this larger
49:49 - this this one this right here is fine
49:51 - but then you have a smaller type
49:54 - as a sub headline
49:56 - not enough white space but then you have
49:58 - slightly larger type here so
50:00 - things are thrown off like the size of
50:03 - this type should be the size uh
50:05 - of this type or vice versa
50:07 - um and you need more white space like
50:09 - let me show you how easily i could just
50:11 - improve this area in a second so like
50:14 - margin bottom
50:17 - okay that's not working
50:21 - oh it's oh there we go
50:23 - uh margin bottom
50:27 - all right so we've moved moved things
50:29 - away just a little bit and then
50:32 - we also have
50:35 - this element
50:38 - margin top
50:42 - oh what is happening here there we go
50:45 - margin top
50:48 - there so i fixed the white space issues
50:50 - at least with this part
50:52 - but again we have those other issues
50:54 - here that need to be addressed
50:56 - um digital agency
50:58 - services this part's
51:00 - not
51:01 - not too bad actually
51:07 - i've never really been a fan of having
51:09 - embedded youtube videos just because
51:11 - they kind of uh
51:13 - it's hard to make them look good
51:15 - especially like depending on what the
51:17 - thumbnail looks like and also the
51:19 - default ui design for the embedded
51:21 - controls
51:22 - so you might wanna just have a button
51:24 - here that just launches into it perhaps
51:27 - or you can actually i think with the
51:29 - youtube player api you can have your own
51:31 - custom
51:32 - uh
51:33 - splash image and then when people click
51:35 - on it then it will it'll play right
51:37 - inside of their
51:38 - um their ui design
51:42 - all right so what do you think this
51:44 - person should get for a rating
51:46 - by far i mean this stuff is better
51:48 - this page or this sections these are
51:51 - sections right here are better than
51:52 - what's happening up here the biggest
51:53 - issue is this background you have to fix
51:56 - that
51:57 - one being the worst 10 being the best
51:58 - let me know what you all think
52:15 - let's see if it's responsive
52:20 - it is
52:21 - so that's working out at least
52:35 - now i'm going to go ahead and give this
52:36 - one a
52:44 - 4.5 or so
52:47 - seems like most of you are rating it a
52:48 - little bit higher
52:52 - all right let's check out uh let's see
52:54 - how long we've been doing this about
52:55 - eight minutes we probably do um one or
52:57 - two more
52:58 - um so let's continue on
53:01 - um
53:08 - simple website made for learning
53:10 - purposes
53:12 - all right
53:14 - uh let's see here
53:19 - yeah it is definitely on the simple side
53:22 - um and that's okay i usually it's better
53:25 - than than trying to make things complex
53:27 - because we see what that does
53:29 - okay what's interesting is
53:32 - if you go to my youtube channel i just
53:34 - did a video
53:38 - about
53:39 - full screen navigations
53:41 - and i did link a video because it was
53:44 - supposed to be included in this one
53:46 - about the ui in the ux of full screen
53:48 - navigations so if you come to this url
53:52 - definitely check this out
53:55 - because
53:56 - i talk about
53:58 - this sort of thing right here
54:01 - this here
54:02 - don't do that
54:04 - on desktop i because uh there's a few
54:07 - reasons why the main the the primary
54:10 - reason is when you have this hamburger
54:12 - on desktop you're requiring a user to
54:14 - click
54:15 - to access links that would otherwise
54:17 - already fit
54:19 - right here
54:20 - so that's just it's a bad pattern to use
54:24 - of course if we're talking about
54:26 - mobile design you don't have all that
54:28 - physical room to place these links you
54:30 - can do this
54:32 - all right but not when you get out to
54:34 - around here and you have enough space
54:36 - so use and adjust your media queries
54:38 - accordingly
54:40 - outside of that um
54:43 - it's a little bit it's a little bit
54:45 - boring i would say for this this
54:46 - particular illustration um you might
54:49 - want to try to either get a custom one
54:51 - or a rethink or get a different one
54:53 - um
54:57 - i'm not a fan of see i would rather have
54:59 - your your call to action because it's
55:01 - really important that it sticks out
55:03 - be styled like the hover state rather
55:05 - than the default state right here
55:08 - the borders just kind of add a little
55:09 - bit more complexity
55:11 - this makes it more simple but it also
55:13 - stands out more too
55:15 - so i would change that
55:17 - and if you have all this empty space
55:19 - here
55:20 - um you could probably
55:22 - restructure things a little bit more to
55:24 - where
55:26 - this type
55:27 - is larger
55:29 - so we can bump that up to like twice the
55:31 - size no not not twice the size
55:34 - like 6.5 rem units possibly
55:38 - now that's looking a little bit better
55:39 - it's filling things out this then can
55:41 - become larger as well
55:44 - not the same size or anywhere near the
55:46 - same size as this but it can still be
55:47 - larger and then you'll fill out this
55:49 - area a bit more
55:51 - who we are i've pushed this stuff down
55:53 - just a tad bit more more white space
55:55 - beneath this it's a little bit too close
55:57 - to this text area
55:59 - and also when it comes to these
56:00 - photographs or these illustrations
56:03 - you know one way to do it is way you're
56:04 - doing it just put it right there and
56:06 - slap it there but you can also um use it
56:08 - as a background image and make them real
56:10 - large and kind of like
56:12 - offs off
56:13 - it's hard for me to explain but um you
56:16 - can have it so that these are enlarged a
56:18 - lot larger and they can even be cut off
56:21 - to the half of the screen and then
56:22 - coming in naturally it kind of it's a
56:24 - more unique approach um and a more
56:26 - appealing visually appealing approach in
56:28 - my opinion
56:31 - this part looks pretty decent make this
56:33 - bold and maybe a little bit larger more
56:35 - white space between this section and
56:37 - that right here
56:38 - but
56:39 - overall it's pretty good
56:42 - um i probably get rid of the thin
56:44 - borders around these areas you don't
56:45 - need those
56:47 - all right so what do you people think
56:49 - this person should get for a rating one
56:50 - being the worst and 10 being the best
57:02 - i'm going to refresh to see just to show
57:04 - you what it originally looked like and
57:06 - we can see there was definitely an
57:07 - improvement by making that larger
57:17 - it is responsive
57:21 - um i'm gonna go ahead and give this one
57:25 - like a
57:37 - yeah probably like a
57:40 - 6.4 or so 6.5
57:45 - all right thank you for that submission
57:48 - um
57:49 - we've been streaming for 57 minutes
57:52 - apparently so i'm going to go ahead and
57:53 - give this uh probably we'll do one more
57:59 - one more review
58:00 - let's go ahead and i'll refresh
58:05 - all right starved
58:07 - collection
58:14 - one second i'm checking it out
58:23 - all right
58:26 - so first
58:28 - let's refresh it so you can see what you
58:30 - experience on load
58:33 - so by default we have a
58:36 - we have a um a an embedded youtube
58:39 - player that's starting automatically
58:42 - probably wouldn't do that we could see
58:44 - the at least it is muted by default
58:48 - but
58:50 - there's a more
58:51 - there's more interesting ways you can go
58:53 - about doing something like this you
58:54 - could take this video clip and then
58:57 - um
58:58 - you can make it as a part of like a hero
59:00 - section like a watermark or whatever
59:02 - because
59:03 - again you're not
59:05 - it's being muted anyway um and then also
59:08 - continue to cite
59:10 - huge ux no we don't do that anymore the
59:12 - whole splash page thing
59:14 - um you want to bring them to your site
59:16 - by default already the main site with
59:19 - your user interface
59:20 - so if i click on continue to cite
59:23 - this is what we are presented with which
59:25 - unfortunately there's not much semblance
59:27 - of a user interface here it just looks
59:29 - like we have a navigation up top the
59:32 - logo over here
59:34 - and then we have just kind of like a
59:36 - random
59:37 - band graphic
59:38 - over here with tour dates
59:40 - um so i think there needs to be more of
59:42 - a restructuring you know music sites are
59:46 - fun because they're really unique uh and
59:48 - they're creative and so i would maybe
59:51 - i'll even do a video about maybe just
59:53 - compiling some of the most unique or
59:55 - interesting
59:56 - effective and non-effective
59:58 - banned websites because they like like i
60:00 - said by nature they're usually really
60:02 - cool looking and they're very different
60:04 - they're able to do different things
60:06 - because they're based on a creative
60:07 - industry
60:08 - um but
60:10 - i would like to see like for instance
60:12 - the navigation kind of seems more of an
60:14 - afterthought
60:15 - in this context and we have photographs
60:18 - overlapping each other
60:20 - um and so there's not a strong semblance
60:22 - of a ui here
60:23 - um
60:25 - like merchandise
60:30 - what happens when i click this probably
60:32 - just scrolls there okay yeah it does
60:37 - and if you're gonna have a merch section
60:38 - usually people want to know how much it
60:40 - costs so including that makes sense and
60:43 - maybe scaling down the size of these and
60:45 - putting them in into actual card
60:47 - containers might make sense as well
60:57 - then again um like your music's uh label
61:01 - and in these two things right here they
61:03 - could be left aligned so having them on
61:06 - top you know it makes more sense to put
61:07 - those in two columns
61:09 - rather than just putting one after the
61:11 - other
61:14 - all right uh what do you think this
61:16 - person should get for a rating one being
61:18 - the worst and 10 being the best remem
61:21 - remember
61:22 - we have this initial page which is a big
61:25 - problem
61:28 - with the uh the whole splash page and
61:29 - requiring people to click here
61:31 - completely just
61:32 - send them right to this page instead but
61:35 - again this has
61:36 - a number of issues that
61:38 - need to be addressed here as well
61:49 - for me i'm just going to go ahead and
61:51 - give this is it responsive i wonder
61:55 - yeah it is
61:57 - i'm going to go ahead and give this a
62:04 - 4.5 or so
62:06 - i think that's pretty fair it seems like
62:08 - most of you agree with me anyhow
62:11 - all right so that here is it so
62:15 - that was the the final stream of
62:19 - the three-part stream series that we've
62:21 - set up with uh free code camp here
62:23 - of course i do this on my own channel uh
62:25 - my own channel is available at
62:28 - youtube.com forward slash design course
62:31 - um i do these like these see here's one
62:33 - i did just four days ago
62:35 - it's the same thing live ui ux review i
62:37 - call it the negative space which is just
62:39 - a play on
62:40 - um ui design fundamental i'm not very
62:43 - that much negative but it's the same
62:44 - exact show that you saw here so if you
62:46 - enjoyed these
62:47 - subscribe to my youtube channel and i do
62:49 - them usually once a week sometimes uh
