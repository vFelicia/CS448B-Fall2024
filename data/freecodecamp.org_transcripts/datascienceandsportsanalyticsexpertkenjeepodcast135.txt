00:00 - and part of getting good at sports
00:02 - especially reactive Sports is training
00:04 - our own internal algorithm to be able to
00:06 - predict outcomes as effectively as
00:07 - possible same thing with tennis same
00:09 - thing with any of these Sports where
00:10 - you're hitting a ball you're actually
00:12 - creating an algorithm yourself to
00:14 - predict what is coming and how to how to
00:17 - locate or go to it and that is what
00:18 - makes the best athletes in those domains
00:21 - if they can accurately predict where
00:23 - something's going to be and to execute
00:25 - after they've gotten to the right
00:27 - positioning which to me is this really
00:28 - cool intersection of
00:30 - like the same process that goes into a
00:32 - machine learning model but we're
00:33 - training ourselves and like the way we
00:35 - train ourselves can be very different if
00:36 - we use gradient to sand if we use some
00:38 - of these different things like
00:46 - [Music]
01:13 - welcome back to the free Cod Camp
01:15 - podcast I'm Quincy Larson teacher and
01:17 - founder of freeco camp.org each week
01:19 - we're bringing you Insight from
01:20 - developers Founders and ambitious people
01:23 - getting it a tech this week we're joined
01:25 - by Ken G he's a data scientist Sports
01:30 - analytics practitioner who works with
01:32 - USA uh us team Golf and USA basketball
01:35 - and he's also the host of the excellent
01:38 - Ken's nearest neighbors podcast and the
01:42 - exponential athlete podcast Ken welcome
01:45 - to the show thank you Quincy always
01:49 - grateful to be able to have
01:50 - conversations with you and come on your
01:53 - show and and hopefully we'll have a a
01:55 - fun little chat here yeah I'm excited to
01:58 - tease more insight out of you because
02:00 - you've been in the field for so long
02:02 - you've interviewed like nearly 200
02:04 - different data scientists over the years
02:06 - through Ken's nearest neighbors podcast
02:08 - by the by the way uh the name of that is
02:11 - riffing off the K nearest neighbors
02:14 - maybe you can explain how K nearest
02:16 - neighbor approach works yeah I mean it
02:19 - at the in most simple terms you're
02:21 - looking at the K which is equal to
02:24 - whatever number you set and then you
02:25 - choose the that many of the nearest
02:28 - neighbors who are CL close by so I have
02:30 - one guest and I choose their you know
02:33 - their or or three guests and uh whoever
02:36 - is closest to that person might be
02:37 - another interesting person to interview
02:39 - but I I can't take credit for that name
02:41 - it was actually a a poll that I did or I
02:45 - opened it up to the community to name
02:47 - the podcast and that was by far my
02:49 - favorite one that was the 100% the one
02:51 - that the one that stuck yeah well you
02:55 - you have such like an interesting career
02:58 - because I know that uh of course of
02:59 - course you have like a formal academic
03:01 - background you know master's degree and
03:03 - studied a ton of stats and things like
03:04 - that but you also play a ton of golf and
03:08 - you've played a ton in the past uh so
03:11 - you've got that athletic background uh
03:14 - and my understanding is you're you're
03:16 - pretty good like I I don't know where
03:18 - you stand at the Grand schema like there
03:19 - are probably uh you know tens of
03:22 - thousands of like very good golf players
03:24 - in the United States but
03:26 - uh I just want to we're going to start
03:29 - by just going way back and I want to go
03:31 - all the way back to where you grew up in
03:34 - Maryland and and kind of like just so we
03:36 - don't have to constantly be revisiting
03:38 - your past like let's go ahead and
03:40 - establish the origin story of Ken G so
03:44 - yeah maybe you could just start by
03:46 - talking about like your early days and
03:49 - uh how you got interested in you know
03:52 - Sports yeah my since I was a little kid
03:55 - my life was almost ruled by sports
03:58 - that's all I really wanted to do if you
04:01 - go back to my earliest professional
04:03 - aspirations it was to be a professional
04:05 - baseball player baseball was my first
04:07 - love I played it all the way until my
04:09 - last year of high school and that's when
04:12 - I switched to playing golf I honestly
04:15 - was not very studious I was I was a
04:17 - terrible student in middle school high
04:20 - school all the way through all my effort
04:23 - and passion was directed at playing
04:25 - sports at at the highest level and I I
04:28 - had some baseball opportunities to play
04:30 - in college but I ended up injuring my
04:33 - shoulder and I also didn't necessarily
04:36 - love the the team nature of baseball
04:38 - which I think is kind of funny I
04:39 - baseball's a weird sport where you have
04:41 - individual statistics for a team game
04:44 - and I was always very much interested in
04:48 - my own performance and trying to improve
04:50 - that it's a little bit harder to isolate
04:52 - how a team performs to create a win than
04:55 - it is to figure out how an individual
04:57 - performs to create good outcomes there
04:59 - yeah yeah so I I think teamwork and all
05:02 - these things are very important
05:03 - especially in the professional world but
05:05 - for myself growing up it's it's hard to
05:07 - measure you know we lose a game and I
05:09 - have a good game did I do something
05:10 - fundamentally wrong was I the the
05:13 - coaches would criticize you for for the
05:15 - the team as a group when individual
05:17 - performances might have varied and and
05:20 - that that was a little bit confusing to
05:22 - me golf was fascinating to me because it
05:25 - was completely quantitative the only
05:27 - thing that mattered was the number
05:29 - number that you posted on the scorecard
05:31 - it didn't matter how you got there how
05:33 - you took all the different shots it
05:36 - matters the the coaches any of these
05:38 - types of people they would just look at
05:40 - the numbers on the card and that
05:41 - objectivity was really interesting to me
05:44 - coming from baseball objectively I was
05:46 - UND sized I around 5'9 in high school
05:51 - maybe 150 lbs I was not exactly a a a
05:55 - physically gifted uh person in that
05:58 - sense and that's something that for
05:59 - example College recruiters looked at
06:01 - that's something that a lot of um there
06:04 - was a lot of onus on that how how big
06:07 - and strong you were is is a major
06:09 - recruiting turistic in in high school
06:11 - athletes and in golf none of that
06:13 - mattered all they care about is what
06:16 - number is on a scorecard at the end of
06:18 - the day and to that for me that was that
06:20 - was a really beautiful thing so I
06:22 - continued down this golf journey I
06:24 - played golf in college I then tried to
06:27 - play professionally afterwards during
06:30 - that journey I took my first economics
06:33 - course I believe it was my third year of
06:34 - college it was a little late in the game
06:37 - and a light switch just went off for me
06:40 - I realized that you could understand the
06:41 - world through math through graphs
06:44 - through Trends and I realized that I
06:46 - could apply that to my own golf game
06:49 - something that also happened in college
06:51 - is I switched Majors I think six or
06:54 - seven times in my first three years and
06:57 - for three of the majors that I switched
06:58 - into I had to take a statistics class or
07:01 - a research methods class so I ended up
07:03 - taking statistics three or four times
07:05 - the same course and who would have
07:07 - thought I got pretty good at
07:09 - understanding statistics and I also
07:10 - realized that I could apply it to my
07:12 - golf game to help get better so I really
07:15 - started to look at the standard
07:17 - deviation of my scoring on different
07:19 - whole types I started to combine that
07:22 - with some economics concepts of
07:25 - increasing or diminishing marginal
07:26 - returns so I'd look at what area of my
07:28 - game would would have the highest return
07:30 - for the time that I spent on it and I
07:33 - got a lot better very quickly I was I
07:36 - thought I was getting good enough to be
07:38 - able to take it to the next level
07:40 - unfortunately that did not work out but
07:41 - it it it ended up being a very positive
07:43 - thing because I was able to longer term
07:47 - uh leverage the interest in math
07:50 - statistics and eventually coding into a
07:53 - career that I that I have now so I I
07:57 - tried to um after took that economics
08:00 - course honestly my life kind of turned
08:02 - around I realized that school could be
08:04 - applied to things that I loved and I
08:05 - just really uh jumped in head first I
08:09 - started to enjoy learning in a very
08:11 - different way and I I ended up
08:14 - transferring schools to uh Talsen
08:16 - University so I was in in um South
08:19 - Carolina before I ended up going into to
08:21 - Baltimore later and you know that's when
08:24 - my my golf career started to take shape
08:26 - that's when I started getting really
08:28 - into uh uh into more statistics into
08:32 - continuing that those economics
08:34 - principles and into taking some business
08:36 - courses uh after that I did go down that
08:39 - professional golf route and while I was
08:42 - there I realized about 3 months in that
08:45 - this wasn't probably going to work and I
08:48 - started studying for the GMAT so my
08:50 - thought is if I go back to grad school
08:52 - probably do something like management
08:53 - consulting I'd be able to have a really
08:56 - broad opportunity set coming out because
08:58 - I was clueless
08:59 - about what I wanted to do at that point
09:01 - in my life so I take the GMAT I do well
09:04 - enough to get into a grad school at the
09:07 - University of Virginia so I did their
09:08 - masters in Commerce
09:10 - program and in the interim I had another
09:13 - two months before class started so I
09:16 - took an internship with a company called
09:18 - DraftKings so at DraftKings it's daily
09:20 - fantasy sports I'd been playing it a lot
09:23 - I was a super user of the product and I
09:27 - was about breaking even which is pretty
09:29 - good with the super rudimentary models
09:31 - that I was using but I realized that
09:33 - there was something more that I was
09:35 - probably missing in terms of analytical
09:38 - chops that I had learned from my basic
09:40 - business and statistic courses so I went
09:43 - there I saw the music squel I saw them
09:45 - using R and python to analyze this data
09:47 - and that was a completely new world to
09:49 - me so I went back I did my degree at the
09:53 - University of Virginia it was a masters
09:55 - in global Commerce with a focus on
09:58 - marketing and Analytics and I learned
10:00 - some sequel I learned some basic
10:01 - analytic skills but honestly that wasn't
10:05 - uh that was I I'd never written a line
10:07 - of code even after that point in my life
10:10 - so we're getting into where I'm I
10:12 - believe 24 25 years old and I'd never
10:14 - written a line of code which is totally
10:16 - fine I mean if I can do it anyone else
10:18 - can can probably create a career in this
10:20 - domain until until late in that
10:23 - period but you know going from there I
10:26 - did end up going into management
10:28 - consulting I worked in the Washington DC
10:31 - area I was in technology Consulting and
10:34 - I absolutely did not enjoy it at all I
10:37 - was advising I have yet to meet somebody
10:39 - who enjoyed it what's wrong with this
10:41 - field the funny thing is that I do
10:42 - Consulting now and I love it right so
10:45 - yeah it's it's all about the domain and
10:47 - how we fit into it and so I was a
10:50 - technology consultant I was advising
10:52 - cios or VPS of software engineering
10:56 - about the software development life
10:57 - cycle and project management and program
10:59 - management and I had no clue what I was
11:01 - doing again I'd never written a line of
11:03 - code how am I supposed to be telling the
11:05 - cios how to run the organization when I
11:07 - have no clue about how the the bits and
11:11 - pieces work together so I decided I'd
11:14 - had enough I was I don't recommend this
11:16 - but on the job I was just sitting there
11:18 - and I was trying to learn how to code I
11:20 - was using I think code academy at the
11:22 - time but yeah probably before fre code
11:25 - Camp yeah yeah I will say now free code
11:28 - Camp is a dramatically resource I wish I
11:30 - had it back then but in between calls in
11:33 - between things I'm sitting there
11:34 - learning how to code and at one point I
11:37 - just
11:38 - said these skills are so
11:41 - important why wouldn't I just go ahead
11:43 - and learn them everything I wanted to do
11:46 - I didn't really mention this but outside
11:47 - of sports I'd always been fascinated
11:49 - with entrepreneurship I'd always been
11:51 - and my parents have been grained in to
11:52 - me that you want to work for
11:53 - yourself and I realized that everything
11:56 - I wanted to do coding was important if
11:58 - you want to build anything in the model
12:00 - modern world coding is one of the number
12:03 - one tools that you use to be able to
12:05 - create that infrastructure so I said why
12:09 - don't I just go back to
12:10 - school if I go back I can learn these
12:14 - coding skills I can buy more time to
12:16 - figure out exactly what I want to do
12:18 - yeah I'll go into a lot of debt but I
12:21 - couldn't see a world where the
12:23 - combination of the Consulting and
12:26 - interpersonal skills that I developed
12:28 - and the coding skill that I would
12:29 - develop would not be valuable in the job
12:32 - marketplace right and so I did the
12:34 - arithmetic yeah so so you just again you
12:37 - had confidence that like you were
12:39 - learning actionable like useful things
12:41 - so that it was okay to take on debt like
12:44 - I I just want to like that's one of the
12:45 - things we often take talk about on the
12:47 - show like the recurring villain of uh
12:50 - student debt essentially in the free Cod
12:53 - Camp you know uh Cinematic Universe
12:56 - right um so I just want to what you're
12:59 - saying with like you were going back you
13:01 - were taking additional debt so you could
13:02 - like learn go even more technical right
13:05 - um yeah yeah sorry I didn't mean to
13:07 - interrupt your flow there but so you're
13:09 - going back after you've already
13:10 - completed the master's degree and
13:11 - essentially you're going back again yeah
13:13 - to payon more debt
13:15 - so uh and yeah I mean I had a good
13:17 - amount of outstanding debt from that
13:19 - previous degree and I said well you know
13:21 - might as well just throw a couple more
13:23 - chips in uh but obviously clear return
13:26 - on that investment for me yeah all of
13:28 - the opportunities that I was seeing from
13:30 - the Consulting side is that one these
13:33 - Engineers are making really good money
13:35 - and they cannot get enough of them at
13:37 - least at that point of time I don't
13:39 - think it's too different now I think
13:40 - that software engineering data science
13:43 - these skill sets are still in demand the
13:44 - the marketplace though is dramatically
13:46 - more difficult right now I don't think
13:47 - that that's something that um that uh
13:51 - I'd want to like spread any false rumors
13:53 - about but yeah um so from there I I
13:57 - actually started working at the company
13:58 - that I work at now so one of my friends
14:02 - I grew up playing golf with him and he
14:04 - hatched this crazy idea to pitch the uh
14:08 - us Ryder Cup team or the PGA of America
14:11 - who runs them on a research program so
14:15 - there's a really good business case I
14:16 - think at the time the US had lost eight
14:19 - or nine of the last 11 Ridder cups and
14:21 - they we hadn't won overseas in something
14:24 - like 20 years and on paper the US team
14:28 - was dramatically better than the
14:29 - European team and for some reason we
14:31 - were just still losing in in these
14:34 - competitions and it had to be a
14:38 - operational a management a leadership
14:40 - type change and analytics is a huge part
14:42 - of it analytics is also very kind of a
14:44 - sexier thing and hiring a stats team or
14:46 - an analytics team is is something that
14:48 - people are willing to pay money for
14:49 - right especially after Like Money Ball
14:52 - popularized kind of the notion of having
14:54 - these you know kind of quantitative like
14:57 - metrics uh applied to athletes right
15:00 - exactly and so that's something that we
15:03 - eventually built out a program for and
15:05 - offered I was able to do that while I
15:07 - was doing my master's degree in computer
15:10 - science and to me that was so such a
15:12 - cool experience because I was learning
15:14 - these sorry I was learning these things
15:17 - and then I was able to apply them
15:18 - directly on the project and the work
15:20 - cycle and the flow that we were doing
15:22 - and so I was able to build out a lot of
15:24 - the infrastructure I was low alloted a
15:27 - lot of freedom to be able to experiment
15:29 - with these tools and these Concepts and
15:32 - that turned into more work into future
15:34 - writer cups future presidents cups into
15:37 - our basketball work into some of these
15:39 - other things and I wouldn't say it's
15:41 - been all history since I actually took a
15:43 - Hiatus and I worked at um I took an
15:46 - internship when I was in grad school I
15:47 - took a Hiatus and I worked at like a
15:51 - rapid growth company in in Chicago for a
15:53 - little while but the sports analytics
15:56 - work has always been my true passion and
15:58 - yeah admit admittedly it probably comes
16:01 - from my own uh my own deficiencies not
16:05 - being able to make it in professional
16:06 - golf has been an unbelievable motivator
16:08 - for me to understand why I could not
16:10 - make
16:11 - it yeah man there's so much to unpack
16:14 - there first of all uh how cool is it
16:17 - that uh you were you were so passionate
16:20 - about this as a kid like like looking
16:23 - back do you think you know kid Kenji
16:26 - would be pretty excited about the work
16:27 - you're doing today
16:29 - yeah I think so he probably wonder why I
16:31 - didn't make it as well and that's sort
16:32 - of the the fun of it too I think
16:36 - that after studying for my other podcast
16:39 - exponential athlete I realized a lot of
16:40 - the reasons why but there there's a a
16:46 - very specific cocktail of the right
16:48 - process the right ingredients the right
16:51 - mentality the right training
16:54 - approach and natural ability that create
16:57 - a great athlete
16:59 - and I realize how how nuanced that is
17:04 - now and I think the beauty of working in
17:07 - this field the beauty of studying this
17:10 - is you get to really understand and
17:13 - enjoy the the small details and how
17:16 - important they are and how much of a
17:19 - difference they make between two people
17:21 - you know the a great round of golf and a
17:26 - pretty average round of golf can be
17:28 - separated by by a single decision or a a
17:32 - single shop and understanding how to
17:35 - look at those in the big picture and
17:39 - over a large amount of data is a very
17:44 - different perspective than you have as
17:45 - an individual athlete where you're
17:47 - living and breathing by every
17:50 - single movement or every single action
17:53 - that you
17:54 - take yeah that's so interesting I mean
17:57 - like I've heard that any field when it
17:59 - gets like sufficiently competitive right
18:01 - like everybody has kind of like this
18:05 - Baseline capability and like it a lot of
18:08 - it comes down to just like I'm not sure
18:11 - if it's like luck uh I'm not sure how
18:14 - much luck plays and like highle
18:18 - competitive things but obviously luck
18:20 - across a large enough sample size gets
18:22 - kind of like averaged out right um so
18:25 - what are the traits in your humble
18:28 - opinion like having studied this
18:30 - just personally curious that that make
18:33 - like an amazing golf player like like a
18:36 - tigerwoods type character I just say him
18:38 - because everybody is familiar with him
18:40 - versus like somebody who uh is just shy
18:44 - of being able to be
18:46 - professional yeah well so let's start
18:48 - with luck I think luck usually comes in
18:51 - the form
18:53 - of genetics you you look at and it
18:57 - varies dramatically by sport so for
18:59 - example I don't think it's a surprise
19:03 - but in a sport like football or
19:05 - basketball or even swimming genetics
19:07 - probably play a dramatically larger role
19:09 - than a sport like golf or even if we go
19:12 - all the way down to darts there's
19:13 - probably less luck involved in in those
19:16 - two sports I mean as associated with
19:19 - genetics as there is in a basketball or
19:22 - a football or swimming there is still
19:24 - some luck in genetics so some from from
19:27 - some of the research that I've done
19:29 - if you look into the field of motor
19:31 - control there is a certain amount of
19:34 - Randomness in everyone's given movements
19:37 - so if you ask me to for example hold
19:38 - this little fidget toy and hold it
19:40 - perfectly still that might be easier for
19:43 - me than for some other people probably a
19:45 - lot easier than for me I'm like terribly
19:47 - clumsy exactly and they call that uh
19:49 - it's like n or like noise in in the in
19:52 - the movement patterns we have so that
19:54 - could be something that is uh uh you
19:57 - know essentially inherent in people is
19:59 - their level of Randomness in their
20:01 - movements and you can imagine in a game
20:03 - like darts that's very fine motor
20:05 - control someone could have just a
20:07 - natural ability of having a steadier
20:09 - hand or less Randomness in their
20:11 - movements that that that could be
20:13 - obviously something I'm obviously more
20:15 - interested in the process and the the
20:18 - conditioning and the training so there
20:21 - there's a bunch of of different factors
20:23 - it would probably be an entire
20:24 - dissertation to to go through those you
20:28 - know my my other podcast each each
20:30 - series is almost 6 eight hours long so
20:34 - uh but at the highest level there's the
20:37 - psychological perspective so the belief
20:40 - that you can do something and the
20:41 - ability
20:43 - to psychological uh distance distance
20:46 - psychologically from the the pressure or
20:49 - the pain or some of these other things
20:50 - to look at things in perspective uh a
20:53 - big part of that I'm seeing now is
20:55 - something called the alter ego effect
20:57 - where people can take on a persona for a
21:00 - specific role that they're playing so
21:02 - let's say I know for a fact we've talked
21:05 - about it you're quite introverted right
21:07 - and if you're going to give a
21:09 - presentation in front of hundreds of
21:12 - people that might not be something that
21:14 - you love I don't know if it is but but
21:17 - probably have to turn turn on like you
21:19 - know gregarious Quincy fun loving happy
21:21 - gol lucky Quincy as opposed to normal
21:24 - Quincy be pretty reserved and like you
21:27 - know keep to himself and and and that's
21:30 - exactly what it is is that we can step
21:32 - into these different personas but we can
21:34 - also build these personas exactly how we
21:36 - want them to be so you could step into
21:39 - uh Tony Robbins Persona where you're
21:41 - you're mimicking his behavior you're
21:43 - you're stepping into to how he handles
21:45 - himself and and his belief system and
21:47 - that also actually creates the
21:49 - psychological distance where you're
21:50 - buffered from those normal feelings of
21:53 - anxiety or those types of things you
21:54 - might have uh this guy Todd Herman who
21:56 - I've interviewed on the other podcast
21:57 - talks a lot about that
21:59 - there's also a process perspective that
22:02 - I think a lot of people don't realize so
22:04 - being great at something coding uh
22:07 - Sports any of these types of things it's
22:09 - a daily habit more so than it is a uh
22:13 - one-off thing that you do so if you
22:16 - pursue Excellence every single day and
22:18 - you do all the right things every day to
22:20 - be able to uh to reach whatever goal
22:25 - that you've set then all you have to do
22:27 - is follow this road map that you've set
22:29 - and a big thing that the best coaches do
22:31 - are that they create this road map for
22:34 - their athletes so the athletes what
22:36 - they're responsible for is setting the
22:39 - goal and putting in the work to get to
22:42 - that goal and then the role of a coach
22:44 - is to figure out all the subsequent
22:46 - steps to be able to get to that goal so
22:49 - if you think about it if you have a good
22:52 - coach and they're good at estimating
22:53 - they're doing all these things greatness
22:55 - becomes this daily task rather than this
22:58 - incredible uh crazy thing that you have
23:00 - to do over time or or this like crazy
23:03 - achievement that you have to do you look
23:05 - at Michael Phelps every day he's in the
23:06 - pool swimming he has very specific goals
23:08 - that he's supposed to do he has specific
23:10 - actions that he takes and more often
23:13 - than not if he takes all of the actions
23:15 - that he's supposed to take every
23:18 - day over the long term over the next
23:20 - fouryear cycle he will hit the world
23:22 - records or he'll get the times that he
23:24 - wants um and inevitably that leads to
23:29 - winning gold medals uh another good
23:31 - thing is that all these athletes really
23:34 - focus on the controllables so as I just
23:36 - mentioned with Michael Phelps he only
23:38 - focuses on times that he wants to set he
23:40 - does not focus on medals that he wants
23:42 - to win there was all this talk about he
23:45 - won those eight gold medals in Beijing
23:48 - yes the gold medals are a result of him
23:52 - hitting the times that he wants those
23:54 - times are completely objective there's
23:56 - something he has control over what he
23:58 - cannot do is control the other swimmers
24:00 - if they just simply swim faster than he
24:02 - does if they had a better day than he
24:03 - did and so there's this whole pipeline
24:06 - of the psychological side the goal
24:08 - setting side the process side and then
24:10 - you have a deep dive into the fitness
24:12 - and the even motor learning or these
24:14 - types of things where there's more
24:16 - effective ways to learn uh more
24:19 - effective ways to practice more
24:21 - effective ways to do these types of
24:22 - things so again there's this whole field
24:25 - of performance uh uh Sports performance
24:29 - a big part of that also is the analytics
24:31 - that I do so how do you evaluate all
24:34 - these things you measure them how do you
24:36 - figure out if you're getting better you
24:37 - track it how do you uh you know evaluate
24:41 - if uh if there's things that need to be
24:43 - changed is you look at the data and you
24:46 - you figure out what is is feasible or
24:48 - what what needs to be adapted so to me
24:50 - there's this beautiful Symphony of all
24:52 - these things fitting together and it's
24:55 - fascinating that I get to go through and
24:57 - study this
24:59 - because the each of these individual
25:01 - disciplines are studied quite well but
25:02 - the again the Symphony of how they
25:04 - connect and how they create music or
25:07 - this beautiful um Melody of of
25:11 - unbelievable uh like outlier performance
25:14 - is not something that I think a lot of
25:16 - people have dived
25:17 - into yeah this melody of unbelievable
25:20 - outlier performance so you're getting to
25:23 - to dive into that you're getting to
25:24 - understand why Babe Ruth was so good at
25:26 - hitting home runs even though
25:28 - they had nothing like the apparatus you
25:30 - have and the faculties you have in terms
25:32 - of being able to like analyze things
25:35 - right like that that was like nearly 100
25:37 - years ago you know and like uh back then
25:40 - he was just good at you know like people
25:43 - didn't necessarily understand why so
25:44 - here's where this all fits into
25:46 - analytics so I I believe I'm correct I
25:48 - think it was Babe Ruth um he was
25:51 - actually blind or like legally blind in
25:53 - his left eye interesting one of the
25:55 - greatest hitters of all time one of the
25:57 - greatest quotequote athletes of all time
25:59 - baseball is a little different game I
26:00 - won't lie about that but baseball a lot
26:03 - of these Sports they're not about raw
26:06 - athletic ability yes you have to have
26:07 - some capability athletically but
26:10 - baseball in particular is about
26:12 - predicting outcomes more than it is
26:14 - being able to react to stimuli so when a
26:18 - pitch is coming out of someone's hand at
26:20 - 90 M hour the amount of time that you
26:23 - have to react is too small for you to
26:26 - actually see the ball and hit the ball
26:27 - and make that cognitive process you have
26:29 - to essentially be starting the swing
26:31 - when the ball is coming out of the hand
26:33 - so you have to be knowing in within a
26:36 - very short period of time and the ball
26:38 - is leaving the hand roughly where you're
26:41 - going to swing and if you're going to
26:43 - swing or not and that is a predictive
26:46 - algorithm that people are running it's
26:47 - essentially like a beian process right
26:50 - um that we have to make very quickly and
26:53 - part of getting good at sports
26:54 - especially reactive Sports is training
26:56 - our own internal algorithm to be able to
26:58 - predict outcomes as effectively as
27:00 - possible same thing with tennis same
27:01 - thing with any of these Sports where
27:03 - you're hitting a ball you're actually
27:05 - creating an algorithm yourself to
27:07 - predict what is coming and how to how to
27:09 - locate or go to it and that is what
27:11 - makes the best athletes in those domains
27:13 - if they can accurately predict where
27:15 - something's going to be and to execute
27:18 - after they've gotten to the right
27:19 - positioning which to me is this really
27:21 - cool intersection of like the same
27:24 - process that goes into a machine
27:25 - learning model but we're training
27:26 - ourselves and like the way we train
27:28 - ourselves can be very different if we
27:29 - use gradient descent if we use some of
27:31 - these different things like it it' be a
27:33 - metaphorical gradient descent right yeah
27:35 - but but to me there there's there's so
27:37 - much uh interesting Nuance there that uh
27:41 - a lot of the things in these fields are
27:43 - not too different a lot of the what
27:45 - makes things or models successful is not
27:47 - that different across domains that's so
27:49 - interesting so like you know I don't
27:52 - know as much about like actual physical
27:53 - sports but like I enjoy watching videos
27:56 - about like competitive fighting games
27:58 - and things like that and that that's the
27:59 - same sort of thing human reaction speed
28:01 - is simply too slow to be able to you
28:04 - know make some of these frame perfect
28:06 - inputs or predict what like a an eight
28:09 - frame punch is going to do and and be
28:11 - able to react to it so you instead have
28:13 - to develop her istics uh and in general
28:16 - like if I'm this far from the other
28:17 - player and they tend to do this type of
28:21 - move then I need to counter it with this
28:23 - move or something like that right and I
28:25 - imagine it's it's very similar in like
28:28 - uh you know sports that are just like
28:31 - where essentially things are happening
28:33 - so fast that you just have to rely on
28:35 - Instinct uh rather than be able to like
28:38 - cognitively process and think like uh
28:41 - you know I I Marvel at like the human uh
28:44 - anatomy and and like the way that um for
28:47 - example a lot of decision- making is
28:49 - distributed down the brain stem like all
28:51 - the way down your spine uh and like when
28:54 - you're like walking around and you like
28:56 - start to step on like you know mouse or
28:58 - something you'll like feel it under your
29:00 - foot and you'll like lift your foot
29:01 - before you like kill the mouse you'll be
29:02 - like you know or something like that
29:04 - right like like and there's no way that
29:06 - that signal has time to go all the way
29:08 - up to your brain and all the way back
29:10 - down to your leg it's actually like part
29:11 - of your like lower spine that's like
29:13 - making that decision and in dinosaurs
29:15 - you even have like almost a second brain
29:18 - like halfway down their backs for like
29:20 - large dinosaurs uh to to help them make
29:23 - those kinds of limic decisions very
29:26 - quickly um so yeah sorry I'm kind of
29:29 - like rambling here but like it's very
29:31 - exciting to me uh the notion that like
29:34 - so much of getting good at sports is
29:36 - like you said like training uh a machine
29:40 - learning algorithm the the same way they
29:43 - they taught like ala go to play Go by
29:45 - just playing itself for hundreds of
29:47 - years simulated of course um yeah so so
29:51 - to some extent just by playing a whole
29:53 - lot of baseball uh and swinging at a
29:55 - whole lot of balls Babe Ruth was kind of
29:57 - training him on
29:58 - like how pitchers pitch and like kind of
30:02 - developing like an internal Instinct for
30:04 - like the probability that the next pitch
30:05 - is going to be a fast ball for
30:08 - example am I is am I kind of like on the
30:11 - going in the right direction in terms of
30:12 - like understanding what you're saying
30:14 - yeah yeah exactly and so now we have
30:17 - ways that we can short circuit that or
30:19 - improve the effect effectiveness of this
30:22 - is that they can strap you to a headset
30:24 - and you can use VR to pick up pitches
30:27 - and identify those those types of things
30:29 - one of the things with sports though is
30:31 - that you realize how important relevant
30:35 - practice is so just picking up an object
30:37 - is not going to be the same as picking
30:39 - up a baseball so very Sports specific
30:41 - practice or or situation specific
30:44 - practice is really relevant and so
30:46 - there's there's a a tight balance
30:49 - between practicing General skills and
30:51 - practicing specific skills uh there
30:53 - there's a lot less crossover than a lot
30:56 - of people generally think and the
30:57 - crossover happens it sort of uh weird
30:59 - times I don't have a great example off
31:01 - the top of my head well if you can dodge
31:02 - a wrench can you dodge a ball that would
31:05 - probably be close enough but you you'd
31:08 - get more Returns on practicing dodging
31:10 - balls than on dodging wrenches like they
31:12 - did in in the movie yeah the movie of
31:14 - course we're talking about is the Viner
31:17 - dodgeball classic uh low brow humor
31:20 - movie that probably has an H well so um
31:23 - let's dive more into the notion of data
31:28 - analytics and I guess how you got into
31:32 - the space because I'm really interested
31:33 - what your early projects were what kind
31:35 - of uh like what your progression was in
31:38 - terms of learning specific skills
31:40 - because a lot of people in the audience
31:42 - are developers or they're you know
31:45 - University students and they're very
31:46 - interested in becoming data scientists
31:48 - or machine learning engineers and that's
31:49 - something you've done and uh I want to
31:53 - understand your journey like you're like
31:54 - so let's rewind it just a little bit
31:55 - you're like 25 26 years old you have
31:58 - learned all this math you've learned all
32:01 - this domain expertise in the field of
32:02 - sports and yet you you know
32:05 - communicating with machines through
32:07 - programming like like what did you learn
32:10 - in in what sequence and like what were
32:11 - some of the early I guess Revelations
32:15 - and step changes in your ability yeah I
32:18 - I I wish I remembered it more clearly
32:20 - than I do but at the early
32:23 - stages when I was in grad school for the
32:25 - first time something that I was was
32:28 - doing was just trying to build models in
32:29 - Excel I was using linear regression it
32:32 - wasn't very
32:33 - sophisticated and I kept trying to
32:36 - understand especially for the daily
32:38 - fantasy sports it's like how are people
32:40 - able to compare and evaluate the
32:42 - different athletes based on the
32:44 - predicted fantasy points so essentially
32:47 - it's daily fantasy you have these
32:49 - fantasy football athletes you choose a
32:51 - team and based on how many points that
32:54 - they score in the real game or their
32:55 - actions on the real field your team team
32:58 - of whoever you've picked gets points and
33:00 - the goal is to maximize points and so I
33:02 - didn't understand maximization I didn't
33:05 - understand budget allocation and these
33:07 - are things that I was completely baffled
33:09 - by so this is version one I'm working in
33:12 - Excel I go to grad school I learned some
33:15 - other different approaches using SPSS
33:18 - some of these other tools still didn't I
33:21 - after grad school I didn't have access
33:23 - to SPSS anymore so I couldn't really so
33:26 - it's a pretty expensive statistical
33:28 - software Tool uh I can't remember the
33:31 - expense I I remember I don't think it
33:32 - was free right it's not matb and a lot
33:35 - of these other kind of like more
33:36 - academic tools you have to spend like
33:37 - hundreds of dollars for like a site
33:39 - license or for the licenses these types
33:41 - of things yeah and so I I couldn't
33:43 - necessarily use those tools to be able
33:45 - to to build the models that I was using
33:48 - and so I just essentially realized hey I
33:50 - have
33:51 - to uh pick up a whole new skill set this
33:54 - coding thing seems like I could build
33:57 - whatever I wanted seems like it's
33:58 - flexible it seems like I can do a lot of
33:59 - these different things and so I go and I
34:02 - I start grad school and I start doing a
34:04 - lot of different projects related to
34:06 - this so I learned about the napsack
34:07 - algorithm so the napsack algorithm is
34:09 - exactly what you need to essentially get
34:12 - the most uh like the most projected
34:15 - points for the lowest cost or the some
34:19 - fixed cost that that you're trying to
34:21 - get so if you have uh a napsack you're
34:24 - trying to figure out okay if you're
34:26 - robbing a a bank what are the high
34:27 - highest price items that I can that I
34:29 - can get to all fit in the bag without it
34:31 - overflowing you wouldn't want to just
34:33 - put the heaviest biggest stuff in
34:35 - because you'd reduce the amount of uh
34:39 - overall High profit or or steings that
34:42 - you would get so you want to maximize
34:44 - the value and that's the algorithm that
34:46 - essentially solves this daily fantasy
34:48 - problem that I was having interesting so
34:50 - like like in Dark Souls trying to figure
34:51 - out the right armor without weighing
34:53 - yourself down and having the encumbered
34:55 - roll you want to have like the fast roll
34:57 - exactly exactly so very useful algorithm
35:00 - for a lot of things but that's something
35:01 - I picked up I was like oh I can use this
35:03 - for this specific problem and it also
35:05 - took a lot of research it was very
35:07 - difficult for me to implement I could
35:08 - implement it in 20 seconds now with chat
35:10 - gbt which is great uh but I still had to
35:13 - know of the algorithm and I had to be
35:15 - able to adapt it for for the use case
35:17 - which is a really good learning process
35:20 - then I started working all all my
35:23 - projects were related to sports so I did
35:25 - a project related to
35:28 - uh predicting basketball performance in
35:30 - games I did a project uh related to UFC
35:34 - fights so something that I was
35:37 - frustrated by was that in the UFC
35:41 - there's a lot of decisions that are just
35:43 - really poorly judged by the referees so
35:46 - there was quite a lot of fights where it
35:48 - went to decision and based on all the
35:51 - objective measures the person that won
35:55 - the fight should not have so you know
35:57 - significant strikes time on the ground
36:00 - control all of these different things
36:02 - and so I was like can I build a robot
36:04 - judge that is better than these uh that
36:07 - is better than these uh judges that are
36:11 - judging the fights and I go in and I
36:14 - built that and at the time I was a
36:15 - little naive I didn't really know how uh
36:17 - I I don't didn't know everything I do
36:19 - now but what I had to train the models
36:21 - on was the judges decisions so you're
36:25 - essentially building circular logic into
36:27 - this but what I did determine even by
36:29 - doing it in that way is that the judging
36:33 - was virtually unpredictable with the
36:37 - metrics that were were there the the
36:40 - data that was collected on the fights
36:42 - and that suggests to me that there is
36:44 - massive bias or that the judges are
36:46 - unbelievably bad because you should
36:48 - still be able to see some sort of trend
36:49 - or be able to predict outcomes when
36:51 - matches go to a decision so it wasn't
36:53 - necessarily a complete loss it's that oh
36:56 - I can't build a model the predic things
36:58 - but in some sense I proved that these
37:01 - judges that they're using are really bad
37:03 - and they should you know have some sort
37:05 - of overhaul associated with that um so
37:08 - really just fing my interests also
37:11 - solving problems that I saw in my own
37:14 - personal life or or a big thing was also
37:17 - data that I had readily available to me
37:20 - and kagle was an incredible resource at
37:21 - that time yeah let's talk about kle
37:24 - kaggle is like almost kind of like the
37:26 - the eighth wonder of the world World in
37:27 - terms of just having tons of data sets
37:29 - like I go there all the time I'm going
37:30 - to be interviewing uh one of the the key
37:33 - people at kaggle um on the Freo Camp
37:36 - podcast heck soon uh so look for that
37:39 - but uh yeah what is
37:41 - kaggle so kaggle
37:43 - is the
37:45 - best data repository and learning
37:49 - platform for data science so they have a
37:53 - ton of competitions that you can compete
37:55 - in to you know op optimize a model or
37:58 - tune a model to get the best prediction
38:00 - but they also have a ton of just random
38:03 - data that people put up as part of a
38:05 - community project what I like the most
38:07 - is that there's a lot of free code that
38:11 - people put up so all these kagle experts
38:14 - or these Advanced Data scientists they
38:16 - share their process of analyzing data
38:19 - with you and you can go and you can
38:21 - learn and and see how they go about not
38:23 - necessarily solving a problem but
38:24 - approaching a data science problem yeah
38:26 - and just a very question that's mostly
38:29 - done in like jupyter notebook correct or
38:32 - Google collaboratory which is kind of
38:33 - like jupyter notebook in the browser
38:36 - yeah they have their built-in Google
38:37 - collab uh environments that they use
38:40 - sorry I didn't mean to interrupt your
38:41 - flow but I just want to like uh make
38:42 - sure I understand so the main way of
38:45 - analyzing and communicating data in
38:48 - 2024 would you say like jupyter notebook
38:51 - type user interfaces are are the way
38:53 - that you break kind of like step by step
38:55 - almost like a the process of like a
38:58 - mathematical proof it's like first we
39:00 - take this data and here's this code that
39:01 - runs against it and then you're kind of
39:02 - like walking people through a narrative
39:04 - of how you're understanding those data
39:07 - is that is that accurate I I think in
39:10 - those communities yes it's probably one
39:12 - of the best ways to be able to
39:14 - share uh data related code I think in
39:18 - production and implementation I I don't
39:20 - personally use notebooks very often I
39:23 - use I I use like vs code and I just use
39:26 - a regular python file rather than a
39:28 - Jupiter file because you can run cells
39:30 - in a python file in very much the same
39:32 - way but when you execute code um if
39:36 - you're doing some sort of ETL or you're
39:38 - you do it in scripts yeah extract
39:40 - transform load right ETL okay yeah yeah
39:44 - so I I prefer to write my code in
39:47 - scripts rather than in executable cells
39:50 - because if we're trying to scale that
39:52 - generally scales dramatically better if
39:55 - I'm trying to share my work and make it
39:58 - understandable to other people which can
40:01 - be sometimes the role of a data
40:03 - scientist Jupiter notebooks are okay I
40:06 - probably would prefer dashboards though
40:09 - if I was going to share it with end
40:10 - users so I think Jupiter notebooks are
40:13 - great for sharing work with other data
40:16 - scientists I think sharing jupyter note
40:19 - books with business people for example
40:21 - or people that don't code is not a good
40:23 - use case and for sharing
40:29 - uh codee with other computers or with
40:31 - systems or with Engineers it's better to
40:33 - do it in just regular python files or in
40:36 - GitHub repos or or in whatever
40:38 - infrastructure that that your company or
40:40 - or these other people use because it's
40:41 - designed to be uh there's there's just
40:46 - benefits and drawbacks of like the
40:47 - different ways that we package code yeah
40:50 - man that's that's really helpful insight
40:53 - uh we're getting the straight to
40:54 - straight from Ken uh as to like how
40:57 - you know data scientists work uh which
41:00 - uh I want to step back and just talk a
41:02 - little bit about the field of data
41:05 - science and how it's evolved over the
41:08 - past really decade or so maybe decade
41:11 - and a half like like the term dat data
41:13 - scientist is my understanding is
41:15 - relatively new and there was even this
41:17 - joke like what do you call a
41:18 - statistician who lives in San Francisco
41:21 - a data scientist right like that it was
41:23 - like kind of like uh almost like just
41:25 - like a an ausc of an old role but the
41:29 - tools have progressed very dramatically
41:31 - obviously the methodology has progressed
41:33 - dramatically the statistics that
41:35 - underpins a lot of this is probably you
41:37 - know very old like in some cases
41:39 - centuries old but um I want to get a
41:42 - feel for like let's just step back and
41:46 - explain it like on five what is data
41:50 - science so I think if you look at what a
41:54 - data scientist does they are simply
41:56 - problem solvers that used relatively
41:59 - Advanced tools so you're presented with
42:03 - a problem hey I don't know why uh my
42:07 - sales are so low this month so problem I
42:11 - go in and I say okay well what what
42:14 - could be causing this one of the best
42:15 - places to look is in whatever data that
42:18 - you have so you go in I start analyzing
42:20 - this what do I use I use uh probably SQL
42:23 - to to pull the data I'll use python or
42:26 - or r one of these languages to uh
42:30 - interpret organize clean and then
42:32 - analyze the data and that's really at
42:36 - the most basic level what it is we're
42:38 - creating the solution and then we also
42:40 - have to tell the you know tell the the
42:43 - stakeholder what the problem is and
42:45 - communicate uh exactly why that's
42:47 - happening and hopefully propose a fix
42:49 - but at the very most basic level that's
42:51 - what it is and the role of data
42:54 - scientists hasn't necessarily changed if
42:57 - you're thinking of an end to-end data
42:59 - scientist what's happened over time
43:01 - though is that one the tools have
43:03 - changed and uh the specialization has
43:07 - changed so if you look back let's say
43:09 - like you're a private investigator right
43:11 - I think as a data scientists in a very
43:14 - similar way hey we're trying to like
43:15 - solve this and understand what's wrong
43:16 - and then propose what you should do
43:18 - about it uh that functions very
43:21 - different uh you know 60 years ago or or
43:25 - even like the chief of police an
43:27 - inspector they were probably doing all
43:29 - of the research and going to the crime
43:31 - scenes and doing all this stuff
43:32 - themselves uh a long time ago now you
43:35 - have a whole team that does one specific
43:38 - part of that process maybe you have
43:39 - someone for uh blood analysis maybe you
43:41 - have someone who goes and interviews
43:43 - different people maybe you have someone
43:45 - that um is organizing and and filing all
43:48 - of the new things so what's same thing
43:50 - is happening in the data domain is
43:51 - rather than just one data scientist that
43:53 - does everything we have like a data
43:55 - engineer that's cured and and managing
43:58 - the data we have a data analyst that's
44:00 - maybe focusing on dashboards and putting
44:03 - those in front of end users we might
44:05 - have a machine learning engineer that's
44:08 - doing uh the the model production and
44:12 - and uh like making sure that these
44:14 - models are up to date and and tuning
44:16 - them and and monitoring them yeah so you
44:18 - have all of these different things that
44:20 - were maybe done less efficiently as a
44:23 - singular person split into multiple
44:25 - roles over time and then again these
44:27 - tools are changing as well just yes
44:29 - we're still using largely the same
44:30 - programming languages which is now
44:32 - predominantly python but we have new AI
44:35 - tools we have new mlops tools we have
44:38 - better uh data engineering tools it it
44:42 - that's that's the core of what data
44:44 - scientists do is not change the again
44:46 - those are the things that have shifted
44:48 - yeah awesome so I'm very interested in
44:53 - just kind of your quick advice we're
44:56 - going to delve so much deeper into this
44:57 - but just for people who are listening
44:59 - since we're we're establishing kind of
45:00 - like the the Baseline understanding of
45:02 - of the field if somebody let's say they
45:04 - have very
45:06 - basic okay so I've heard that data
45:08 - science is really like a fusion of three
45:11 - different
45:12 - disciplines mathematical knowledge
45:15 - programming capability and domain
45:18 - expertise and um I'm not would you agree
45:21 - with that assessment or is that
45:23 - incomplete no I think that that's pretty
45:25 - reasonable I would say
45:27 - that in the world we live in now in a in
45:31 - like a future AI
45:33 - World
45:36 - um all of those are
45:38 - probably like the the requirements for
45:41 - each of those is reducing yeah um I
45:44 - would say the the most important thing
45:46 - is understanding how to ask the right
45:48 - questions
45:50 - and developing that sort of meta problem
45:52 - solving skill because in a world now we
45:56 - can
45:57 - you generally need two of those things
46:00 - uh to be very effective uh whereas you
46:02 - used to need three of those things so
46:04 - for example some of the people that win
46:07 - the sports cackle competitions they know
46:10 - nothing about the sport in question
46:12 - their learning is they go but that
46:13 - outside perspective can actually be very
46:15 - useful in helping them solve the problem
46:18 - because they're thinking about it not
46:19 - through the same lens as all the people
46:21 - who have been working in the domain
46:23 - before um in a world now where if you
46:25 - have really good uh mathematic
46:28 - mathematics knowledge you can use a
46:30 - Chachi BT to complement or supplement
46:33 - some of the coding if you can code
46:35 - really well and you have great domain
46:37 - expertise you can do enough research in
46:39 - the math to be able to um or you can
46:43 - experiment enough with a code that you
46:45 - can kind of iron out the need for some
46:48 - of that math knowledge that you used to
46:50 - need to have so I would say that that's
46:52 - also something that is technically
46:53 - changing as
46:55 - well yeah that's so interesting the
46:57 - notion that essentially you can Shore up
47:00 - the weakest of those three dimensions
47:03 - using AI tools um and I want to talk a
47:07 - lot about AI tools uh and we're probably
47:10 - going to talk a great length about those
47:11 - but I do want to get back into uh now
47:14 - that we've established that that
47:15 - foundation so just just to reiterate
47:18 - what you just said somebody who's
47:20 - relatively weak in mathematics but knows
47:22 - a lot about the sport in question or the
47:25 - general uh field that
47:27 - is being analyzed um they they can make
47:31 - up for the math or they can make up for
47:32 - the programming capability by having a
47:35 - tool like uh gp4 create some uh scripts
47:39 - that accomplish specific things uh like
47:41 - here's a mathematical formula can you
47:42 - implement this in Python code right uh
47:45 - or uh people that don't have domain
47:47 - expert that's so fascinating that some
47:49 - of the best analysts of different sports
47:51 - don't even necessarily know how the
47:52 - sport works it reminds me of you know
47:56 - like like does gbt even know what a go
47:58 - board is right or like does does alpha
48:01 - go even know what a go board is do they
48:03 - know what stones are do they know what
48:05 - the the concept of two people sitting
48:07 - over a table as has been played for I
48:10 - don't know four 5 thousand years you
48:12 - know setting the stones in the different
48:14 - uh grid points no it doesn't know
48:16 - anything it just knows that like the
48:17 - expected value of going to this place is
48:19 - high you know or it's just predicting
48:21 - the next move right um yeah yeah I mean
48:25 - and humans who don't have that domain
48:28 - expertise are still able to perform very
48:30 - well apparently uh in these CLE
48:32 - competitions so I mean can you give me
48:34 - like kind of like an extreme example do
48:36 - you have any off the top of your head of
48:37 - like somebody who did really well at a
48:39 - competition without necessarily knowing
48:41 - anything about it there I will tell you
48:43 - a quick very fascinating real world
48:45 - example of this so there is uh a
48:49 - gentleman in I think he's from like he's
48:52 - somewhere in Europe sorry is this the
48:54 - Scrabble example Scrabble yes
48:57 - the guy he an English speaker he does
48:59 - not speak French but he's like a
49:01 - Scrabble Champion like and uh he decided
49:04 - he wanted to go to France and like beat
49:06 - the French at their own you know at
49:08 - scravel but he didn't want to bother
49:10 - learning French uh so what he did was he
49:12 - instead like memorized the French gravel
49:15 - dictionary which is so absurd for like a
49:18 - neurotypical person like me like I
49:20 - struggle to you know you know I've been
49:22 - studying Chinese for 20 years and I
49:24 - struggle sometimes to like even remember
49:26 - remember like how a specific character
49:29 - looks that I've looked at like 20 times
49:31 - and yet this guy is remembering the
49:32 - exact sequence of letters in these
49:34 - extremely long you know weirdly
49:36 - pronounced French words but he probably
49:37 - doesn't know how to pronounce them
49:38 - either so that's not a difficulty he
49:39 - just has to remember the sequence of you
49:42 - know Roman characters so he can put
49:44 - those onto the Scrabble table but he did
49:46 - it right like do you do you know the
49:48 - story behind that I believe he won the
49:50 - French
49:52 - Championship uh possibly multiple times
49:55 - um but
49:57 - uh but yeah I mean that that's where you
49:59 - have he has domain knowledge in Scrabble
50:02 - and probably has like a framework in
50:03 - place there but you know he realized
50:07 - that can scale to to other languages
50:08 - maybe he he saw opportunities for words
50:11 - that French people wouldn't necessarily
50:12 - do right if you're a native English
50:15 - speaker even if you play Scrabble
50:18 - certain words are going to be more
50:20 - commonly thought of in a Scrabble game
50:23 - that you play because they're more
50:25 - prevalent in our vocabulary he might be
50:28 - going there and he has no distribution
50:33 - of like recently used words or popular
50:35 - words or anything like that they're it's
50:38 - like a uniform opportunity to explore
50:40 - all these different options it could
50:41 - have actually helped him because he
50:43 - didn't have these internal biases with
50:45 - French words that he might with English
50:46 - words so to me that's like a pretty
50:48 - fascinating thing and and that's the
50:49 - whole idea there's a great book by David
50:51 - Epstein called range and he talks about
50:54 - how either analogous thinking so pulling
50:57 - in ideas from different domains into
51:00 - your current domain can be a really
51:01 - powerful thing or coming at things from
51:04 - an Outsiders perspective can help you
51:07 - identify you know the these built-in
51:10 - biases that that people and
51:12 - organizations have and to me that's
51:14 - something that has been a very big
51:16 - change in my perspective on things is
51:18 - that yes uh domain knowledge absolutely
51:22 - very useful but it's also important to
51:25 - have Outsider knowledge or have a
51:26 - different view or a different
51:27 - perspective and if we're thinking about
51:29 - the job market or any of these types of
51:31 - things that's not something that a lot
51:33 - of people uh
51:36 - relish or or or in your own personal
51:39 - life you don't really see it as an
51:40 - important or valuable thing but
51:42 - employers or um or people that are
51:48 - hiring for roles they might find a
51:50 - unique perspective to be very valuable
51:53 - because it is inherently different than
51:54 - than what everyone else is doing and um
51:57 - to me that's something that is is
51:59 - frequently overlooked again I'm not
52:00 - going to say domain knowledge is not
52:02 - important but I would argue the ability
52:05 - to at least step outside of the domain
52:08 - and pull in things from other places
52:11 - that's as important if not more
52:13 - important because that's where
52:14 - Innovation happens yeah what are some
52:17 - ways you personally like do you just try
52:20 - to be like a verocious reader of like
52:21 - lots of different topics or something
52:23 - like do you find in your day-to-day work
52:26 - analy ing uh Sports Performance and
52:28 - things like that uh that some analogous
52:32 - um topic or or some completely different
52:35 - topic or you just heard some random
52:37 - story like 10 years ago and you're like
52:39 - wait a second this reminds like that
52:40 - kind of pattern recognition that the
52:41 - human brain is so good at like do you do
52:44 - anything to actively just shove more
52:47 - random stuff into your brain so that you
52:50 - can potentially have this big
52:51 - associative web to draw from oh yeah
52:54 - 100% so the biggest thing for me is well
52:57 - there's three things that I do that I
52:59 - think are really effective for that so
53:01 - the first is reading a ton I probably
53:03 - read about three books a week now uh
53:06 - which is a little aggressive but for the
53:09 - podcast the exponential athlete podcast
53:11 - that I do I usually I have to read five
53:13 - to 10 books for each series that I do on
53:16 - the athletes so it's pretty involved but
53:18 - I'd want to do it anyway it's super
53:20 - interesting to me I'm reading a lot more
53:22 - biography than I used to uh to me
53:25 - learning from individual stories I mean
53:27 - it makes sense I I do the Ken neighbors
53:29 - podcast where I do this biopic of
53:30 - interesting people in the data space but
53:32 - to me I start to make these
53:35 - relationships between what other people
53:37 - have done rather than necessarily the
53:39 - large uh Concepts uh that you get in a
53:42 - business book or more structured book
53:44 - I've been I found that to be very useful
53:46 - so I read a ton I try to read a diverse
53:49 - array of things uh but to be honest I
53:51 - mostly read non-fiction every now and
53:54 - then I'll dabble into
53:57 - some fiction I read the about half of
53:59 - the Red Rising Series so far which is I
54:02 - really enjoy I highly recommend those to
54:04 - to anyone uh the other thing I do is I
54:07 - listen to
54:09 - podcasts I I really absolutely wear out
54:12 - the founders podcast I think that uh
54:15 - Founders innovators entrepreneurs are
54:18 - people who are doing things
54:19 - fundamentally
54:20 - differently and it's in the way that
54:24 - people approach things differently where
54:26 - you find innovation of sparkk you know
54:28 - 90% of it might not work for you or
54:31 - probably won't work for you but there
54:32 - will be 10% a 5% that is different than
54:35 - what you're reading about other people
54:37 - doing that might resonate with you and
54:39 - again I I think life is about a series
54:43 - of um sort of like Venture Capital right
54:46 - where you're uh trying a lot of
54:49 - different things and eventually some of
54:51 - these things hit and they really work
54:52 - for you and that's what you have to
54:54 - continue to index on and the way that we
54:56 - find those little things that we'll hit
54:58 - is in a lot of research a lot of study
55:01 - and and yeah I mean completely I I
55:03 - cannot say enough good things about the
55:04 - founders podcast yeah I've listen to it
55:06 - too I just want to I also want to chime
55:08 - in and say like listen to the Anna
55:10 - winter I think the V lady she's great
55:13 - excellent episode I'll link to uh to
55:15 - that episode and also the James Cameron
55:17 - episode's really fascinating too the
55:20 - movie director um yeah so it's mostly
55:23 - like people who found companies like
55:25 - especially like robber Ron type Aras and
55:27 - stuff but but there's also like lots of
55:30 - kind of contemporary figures I think
55:31 - there's probably an episode about Oprah
55:33 - Winfrey for example um so sorry I didn't
55:36 - mean to do ear but I just wanted to
55:37 - chime in and I I'll link to uh I'll link
55:40 - to that Anna Wintour episode uh it out
55:43 - also link to the the James Dyson one
55:46 - that's one of my favorite ones where he
55:49 - has this thing of essentially being
55:51 - different for the sake of it rather than
55:55 - necessarily
55:56 - um like different with functionality
55:59 - that's something I've tried to integrate
56:01 - into my life is that novelty is
56:04 - something that We crave and the only way
56:07 - that we're able to create truly
56:10 - Innovative things is to
56:13 - build uh like Randomness or difference
56:16 - or contrarianism into what we're doing
56:19 - he might take a little too far at times
56:20 - but Dyson's been a pretty successful
56:21 - company for making vacuum cleaners and
56:24 - hair dryers so um
56:27 - it's interesting uh to think about as
56:29 - well yeah yeah and I'll just say uh I
56:31 - just want to share a quote like J George
56:33 - Bernard Shaw said uh the reasonable man
56:36 - and by the way this is man uh today it
56:38 - would be the reasonable person uh the
56:40 - reasonable man adapts himself to the
56:42 - world the unreasonable one persists in
56:46 - trying to adapt the world to himself
56:48 - therefore all progress depends on the
56:51 - Unreasonable Man exactly exactly how I
56:55 - would describe it if you try if you just
56:57 - keep doing things like the way
56:58 - everybody's always done them you're not
56:59 - going to get any Innovation right by
57:01 - definition Innovation is throwing new
57:02 - things at the wall so um yeah cool sorry
57:06 - to interrupt your flow again I love
57:08 - sharing like that that quote has always
57:09 - been very inspiring to me and uh it it's
57:12 - reminded me that like it's it's fine to
57:14 - be unconventional and to take different
57:16 - approaches and like all those people
57:18 - that went to school with you that did
57:20 - everything perfectly and like had this
57:22 - very clear linear progression uh in
57:25 - their career and everything and like
57:27 - they probably have a great like
57:29 - lifestyle and and maybe they've got a
57:31 - house and they've got kids and all that
57:32 - stuff but if you choose like a
57:34 - completely different path there's a lot
57:36 - more risk but you could end up doing
57:39 - something completely different like like
57:41 - being able to work you know kind of your
57:43 - dream job doing data analysis oh your
57:45 - dream job would probably be to be a pro
57:46 - golfer it sounds like but uh you're
57:49 - you're I actually I would prefer this
57:51 - much more the travel lifestyle of these
57:53 - professional golfers as I've gotten to
57:55 - work with more of them
57:57 - uh it's not something I would enjoy
57:58 - you're on the road 40 weeks of the year
58:01 - it's hard to have a family it's hard to
58:03 - have
58:04 - consistency I very much like what I do
58:06 - now I I think it is between the
58:08 - podcasting and the analytics uh it's
58:10 - it's perfect for me and this this isn't
58:12 - a job that just like existed when you
58:14 - were a kid this wasn't something you
58:15 - could like necessarily aspire to be
58:17 - right uh this is something you had to
58:19 - kind of gradually like kind of pathfind
58:21 - your way into over time right 100% well
58:24 - to go back really quickly to that quote
58:26 - you said I on my board here I I
58:28 - literally uh I have it written down it's
58:31 - it's the do things others won't so you
58:33 - can accomplish what they can't so if you
58:36 - do all the same things as other people I
58:38 - think it's unreasonable to expect that
58:41 - you'll accomplish different things than
58:42 - they will and so by doing different
58:45 - things every day or experimenting I
58:47 - think you get to a different place um
58:50 - just overall and and what your
58:52 - experience can be and so that's
58:54 - something that drives me every single
58:55 - day day and it's very much in the same
58:58 - vein of of doing the the unreasonable
59:00 - things um the the last thing that I do
59:03 - to consolidate all this information is I
59:05 - try to go on a lot of walks and I also I
59:07 - I meditate every day uh usually in the
59:10 - morning and then at night before I go to
59:12 - bed it just helps me to have that time
59:14 - where my brain can do the work for me
59:17 - and that's usually when I have the best
59:19 - Insight it's a little disruptive because
59:21 - you're sitting there and you're trying
59:22 - to not think about anything and all the
59:24 - great ideas and all the connections are
59:26 - being made and they pop into your head
59:28 - so you just write them down and then you
59:30 - uh and then you move on but to me that's
59:33 - uh there's two parts where you have to
59:37 - accumulate knowledge and information and
59:40 - then you have to let the subconscious
59:42 - brain take over and digest it I I think
59:45 - that when people are learning in general
59:48 - that's a step that everyone forgets I
59:50 - know that when I was learning how to
59:51 - code when I was learning through all of
59:53 - my school years I would be so frustrated
59:56 - at that I couldn't get something and
59:58 - then if I went for a walk I took some
60:00 - time off for some reason it just sort of
60:03 - figured itself out in my head and I
60:05 - think that that's an integral part of
60:07 - learning that is almost uh um almost
60:12 - glazed over in every single educational
60:16 - institution that I've ever been a part
60:17 - of yeah absolutely you like I'm not sure
60:21 - if there are parallels to like how we
60:22 - train machines um but but like I know
60:25 - myself like
60:26 - precisely what we were saying earlier
60:28 - like every single day I play bass for
60:30 - like you know half an hour or so every
60:31 - single day I study Chinese uh for like
60:35 - half an hour and and I've just it's just
60:37 - part of my routine and I know just like
60:39 - Michael Phelps he's trying to like
60:42 - Target this time and he has confidence
60:44 - that if he is consistent in his you know
60:47 - uh I guess adherence to his regiment uh
60:50 - to to the the game plan he's laid out
60:52 - for himself the road map that he will
60:54 - get there he has that kind of self
60:56 - belief that he is getting better even if
60:58 - he has up his actual progress feels like
61:00 - it's going like this if you just measure
61:02 - like oh today I'm swimming slightly
61:03 - slower than I was yesterday you know but
61:06 - it's kind of like a sine wave that's
61:08 - going up and to the right right and and
61:10 - so many things in life are like that and
61:11 - I I believe that that's how it is with
61:13 - learning like you feel like you hit a
61:15 - plateau and you're like oh man but it
61:18 - could be that it's just like an
61:19 - instantaneous kind of like feeling of
61:21 - that and in fact from an absolute
61:23 - standpoint you're higher than you've
61:25 - ever been in terms of your ability to
61:27 - perform could be that you're just having
61:29 - an off day maybe you didn't sleep very
61:31 - well or um you're distracted by some
61:33 - sort of stressor in your life but uh as
61:36 - long as you're you know putting in the
61:38 - time and the energy to incrementally
61:40 - step that up uh I I feel like it's
61:43 - almost like a foregone conclusion that
61:44 - you will improve whether you hit your
61:46 - goal uh depends on how audacious your
61:48 - goal was but you you will improve and I
61:51 - don't believe that there's like there
61:53 - may be some things where there is like a
61:55 - ceiling like a performance heing
61:58 - but I haven't discovered that in any of
62:01 - my own personal Endeavors like I feel
62:03 - like everything I practice at I get
62:05 - better at and uh like if you were to go
62:08 - and look at my old podcast and probably
62:09 - if you were to go and look at kenji's
62:12 - old podcasts he'd be less effective and
62:15 - aite and he probably uh than he is today
62:18 - right and like that's certainly how I
62:19 - feel about myself uh to the to the
62:21 - extent that I don't even edit my podcast
62:23 - I'm like it's like the equivalent of
62:24 - like Crossing between the two uh the two
62:27 - buildings on on a tight wire without
62:29 - without a net like I genuinely feel like
62:32 - that forces me to perform and it forces
62:34 - me to be interesting and it forces me to
62:37 - uh to not interrupt my guest too much
62:39 - for example or go on too many tangents
62:42 - uh so so getting back to that what you
62:44 - were saying
62:46 - about accumulating knowledge then
62:48 - processing it meditating in the morning
62:51 - and in the evening and and so it's
62:53 - almost kind of like like uh you're
62:55 - training you're you're ingesting and and
62:58 - uh Ingress I'm not sure what the the
63:00 - actual term is in data science but but
63:02 - like you're you're piling in all the
63:04 - knowledge and then now you're you're
63:06 - able to like actually have like some
63:07 - output from that and that output is just
63:09 - random insights that occur to you when
63:11 - you're
63:11 - meditating yeah pretty much I I mean I I
63:15 - would say some of the best insights that
63:16 - I've had about my career and my life and
63:18 - those types of things come in that
63:19 - process and also related to my work or
63:22 - some of these other things it
63:24 - just it it's crazy easy to conceptualize
63:28 - that like the best things aren't
63:30 - necessarily things that I have logically
63:32 - come to but I think that this is the
63:35 - process that humans have used for
63:37 - thousands of years I mean you look at
63:39 - some of the greatest um inventors ever
63:42 - you look at Einstein you look at um
63:46 - Edison you look at some of these types
63:48 - of people this was a part of their
63:50 - routine I think it was Edison he would
63:51 - hold like a like a a ball in his hand
63:54 - and he'd he'd like
63:56 - essentially try to almost fall asleep in
63:59 - his chair or he'd get in this like dream
64:01 - light like Zone and if he dropped the
64:03 - ball he fell asleep but if he could hold
64:05 - the ball there he would be in this like
64:08 - correct zone for him to be uh inspired
64:11 - and and to invent and to create
64:12 - incredible things I wouldn't quote that
64:14 - that's Edison but it's some great
64:16 - inventor so yeah that's that's an
64:18 - interesting process I mean you have to
64:20 - throw stuff at the wall and see what
64:21 - works you have to try different you know
64:24 - things like I also am a lover of walking
64:27 - uh and I would say like even though I go
64:28 - to the gym uh you know two or three
64:30 - times a week and just do like cables and
64:32 - stuff uh some free weights like the main
64:34 - thing that I do for physical activity is
64:36 - I'll just throw on my headphones and
64:38 - I'll throw on these one hour long
64:41 - podcasts like this one that you're
64:42 - listening to right now like like Ken's
64:43 - nearest neighbors and uh and I just kind
64:48 - of like ingest it's my my information
64:51 - diet it's somebody teaching me about the
64:52 - world teaching me about new like I love
64:55 - uh stuff stuff you should know is like
64:57 - oh I haven't checked that one out yeah
64:59 - so that's like a great one where these
65:00 - two guys just like do a bunch of
65:01 - research about a topic and they talk
65:03 - about it and that could be something as
65:05 - simple as like how is barbecue made or
65:07 - something like that like completely just
65:11 - almost like you would throw a dart at a
65:12 - board and you just hit some topic all
65:14 - right let's do a whole bunch of research
65:16 - on that like I think they had one about
65:17 - like Zamboni machines like that's how
65:20 - weird and but like I know quite a bit
65:22 - about zon machines from having listened
65:24 - to that that I before I never even knew
65:26 - I wanted to listen to that yeah so um so
65:30 - that's that's cool that you're like
65:31 - really into walking uh as well and uh
65:35 - like Steve Jobs you know famous
65:37 - Divergent thinker uh loved to go on
65:39 - walks and uh he would even like whenever
65:42 - he wanted to have a meeting with
65:43 - somebody he would grab them and he like
65:45 - let's go on a walk and walk and talk it
65:47 - increases your heart rate uh it ju like
65:50 - you know that's why I like record these
65:51 - standing up because I like to have like
65:52 - a higher heart rate a higher energy
65:54 - level and I think that does do translate
65:56 - into some like slightly better you know
65:58 - brain performance when I'm asking
66:00 - questions and stuff but but like you
66:02 - definitely think when you're walking I
66:04 - find that when I'm running like I'm too
66:05 - tired to like really think as well so
66:08 - walking seems to be like the The
66:09 - goldilock Zone like the perfect kind of
66:12 - happy medium between like no physical
66:14 - exertion like relaxing and meditating
66:16 - like you said earlier and some degree of
66:18 - physical exertion you know or and like
66:20 - over exerting yourself to where you
66:22 - don't have the capacity to think right
66:25 - where do you stand on like why do you
66:27 - like walking so much so there's really
66:30 - good science around being in nature uh
66:33 - prly walking through Parks or green
66:36 - areas uh
66:38 - around essentially one sense of a so
66:40 - sense of a is very good for creating
66:42 - psychological distance uh nature is
66:44 - restorative so
66:46 - if please don't quote me on the actual
66:49 - science here uh I can try to find the
66:51 - research for you uh but I if I recall is
66:54 - basically if you go f 20-minute walk uh
66:57 - without your phone versus with your
66:58 - phone there's like unbelievable
67:00 - differences in your brain uh just like
67:02 - going for a walk in nature versus not
67:04 - going for walk in nature uh there was a
67:06 - very good study
67:09 - about um I think it was housing project
67:12 - in
67:13 - Chicago uh and I believe half of the
67:16 - housing project had green views and the
67:18 - other half had city views and they went
67:20 - through and essentially studied the um
67:24 - these were randomly signed and they
67:26 - studied the psychological profiles of
67:30 - the people in green versus city views
67:32 - and I believe they found like
67:34 - dramatically less instances of anxiety a
67:36 - lot more motivation a lot more energy
67:38 - ability to focus uh there's just really
67:41 - good I mean going for a walk in nature
67:43 - is just in no way bad for you yeah it
67:46 - has a ton of positive effects and it has
67:48 - that very similar meditative effect
67:50 - being able to um like I think there's
67:54 - also something around
67:56 - uh like not seeing all these crazy
67:58 - geometric shapes that we see when we're
68:00 - in a city so everything is very square
68:02 - but very few things in nature are
68:04 - necessarily perfectly round there there
68:07 - are like these weird amorphous shapes
68:08 - that make our brain have to do different
68:10 - things and I think that there's
68:11 - something inherently beneficial even if
68:14 - I can't necessarily recall the research
68:16 - or remember exactly what it is but um
68:20 - yeah basically all the science says go
68:23 - for walks all the science says
68:26 - uh meditate take time do these types of
68:28 - things and
68:29 - exercise and they've done very well for
68:32 - me in terms of my ability to understand
68:35 - the world around me my sense of self and
68:37 - my sense of innovation and understanding
68:39 - as well yeah let's talk a little bit
68:41 - about geography so my understanding is
68:44 - you did you used to live in Hawaii yeah
68:47 - so I was in uh Chicago for grad school
68:51 - and then Co hit and I decided that it
68:56 - was uh not super great to be trapped
69:00 - inside in the freezing
69:02 - cold uh just by myself so I said you
69:05 - know what I'm going to go somewhere warm
69:07 - uh my my dad uh you know grew up in
69:10 - Hawaii I have a ton of family there and
69:12 - my parents have a uh a retirement home
69:14 - that they had purchased and so they
69:16 - weren't living there I said it'd be a
69:18 - good son I'd look after the place and I
69:20 - went out there and uh I stayed there for
69:23 - for about a year and then I I moved into
69:25 - my own place but um yeah I was out there
69:28 - and then I very recently moved to Austin
69:30 - Texas yeah awesome so we're in the same
69:32 - same time zone I'm in uh Plano Texas
69:34 - which is uh you have maybe like three
69:37 - hours three and a half hour drive you
69:38 - got to come visit I will absolutely like
69:41 - I didn't realize you were in Austin
69:43 - until like recently when you mentioned
69:44 - it in one of your podcasts uh so yeah
69:48 - let's like obviously Hawaii famed for
69:50 - its natural beauty it's like the most
69:52 - remote island chain in the world and it
69:55 - has such Lush kind of like probably like
69:59 - very distinct wildlife and stuff so did
70:01 - you spend if somebody's going to Hawaii
70:05 - uh and they want to like really get like
70:08 - the best out of Hawaii in terms of like
70:10 - natural beauty and things like that what
70:12 - are some things that you would recommend
70:13 - that they do while they're there uh
70:15 - probably go to Big Island uh Volcano
70:18 - National Park is awesome you see the
70:19 - active volcano there's a beautiful hike
70:21 - in there there's great hikes on all the
70:23 - islands admittedly I didn't capitalize
70:26 - on it as much as I should have I
70:28 - actually do not enjoy the beach at all I
70:31 - uh I think sand is like the worst thing
70:33 - ever
70:35 - created I don't have a problem with the
70:37 - water just getting to the water on an
70:39 - island you have to pass through the sand
70:41 - and that's that's a difficult thing for
70:42 - me um but yeah I think you're the first
70:47 - person I've ever heard say they
70:48 - distinctly don't like sand I mean yeah
70:50 - it gets in your shoes and it sticks to
70:51 - you and there's sometimes like I'll be
70:53 - walking like uh here in Texas when you
70:56 - walk on the beach there's these little
70:57 - crabs that have like little holes have
70:59 - you seen these these little holes they
71:01 - breathe through and like sometimes if
71:02 - you actually step on like one of their
71:04 - holes that they're in they'll reach up
71:05 - and they'll like claw your feet yeah oh
71:08 - interesting and that permanently like
71:10 - traumatized me like I don't want to walk
71:12 - on the beach anymore in Texas cuz the
71:14 - crabs will like grab your feet yeah
71:16 - they're after you yeah wild that's
71:19 - that's an interesting so so you like the
71:20 - water but you don't like the sand that
71:22 - you have to get did you ever like just
71:24 - like get a really good run I got on a
71:26 - boat I don't I don't I don't mind uh
71:28 - some of the other ways to get into the
71:30 - water but uh and I I'm not completely
71:33 - aers to sand if I have mentally prepared
71:35 - enough I'll I'll go to a beach what is
71:36 - it about the sand I just the the the
71:39 - feeling and then it gets in your car and
71:41 - then it gets in your bed somehow and
71:42 - then it's everywhere and you can't get
71:44 - rid of it and it's just it's just the a
71:47 - curse that follows you forever yeah it's
71:49 - like if you have a birthday party and
71:51 - somebody brings glitter yeah exact the
71:53 - exact same phenomenon for me I was
71:55 - saying but um yeah I think if we're
71:59 - thinking about the I actually have been
72:02 - Outdoors a lot more in Texas so in
72:05 - Hawaii because of the you know like the
72:08 - living conditions it's an island so
72:09 - there's only a there's space is so much
72:11 - more limited uh you have to you know
72:14 - drive or take some time to get to the
72:16 - Natural Beauty and these types of things
72:18 - I found moving to Texas there's a lot
72:20 - more space there's a lot more like
72:23 - intermixed Greenery in the City areas
72:26 - and and in the kind of suburb suburb
72:29 - areas and it's it's been really good for
72:31 - me uh on that front yeah um I obviously
72:35 - we'll still visit Hawaii quite a bit I
72:36 - think I'm going to go back in June but I
72:38 - I I've really really enjoyed moving yeah
72:41 - I mean Texas
72:42 - does I just want to like acknowledge
72:45 - Texas is not a perfect place there are a
72:46 - lot of problems here uh but one of the
72:49 - things that they've done a really good
72:50 - job of is like have lots of parks
72:52 - everywhere and like they they do invest
72:54 - a lot in public spaces that you can go
72:57 - and like walk around we've got some near
72:59 - my house um during the pandemic I took
73:01 - my kids to tons of playgrounds and just
73:03 - let them they got extremely good at like
73:05 - doing monkey bars and like hanging for
73:07 - like seemingly super human length of the
73:09 - time with their tiny body weights and
73:11 - stuff uh and and uh yeah like Texas is a
73:14 - really great place if you just want to
73:16 - go hiking or we went to San Antonio we
73:18 - did these like caves if you get a chance
73:20 - to go to San Antonio there's there's
73:22 - like this C an hour and a half away so I
73:23 - might as well yeah yeah absolutely and
73:25 - there's also this cool like ropes course
73:27 - thing with like zip lines and stuff
73:29 - awesome uh I'll if you're curious I I'll
73:31 - try to find the the name of the place I
73:33 - I'll shoot it I'll put it in the show
73:35 - notes
73:37 - perfect so well so one thing I want to
73:39 - say is that if I if I look at growing up
73:43 - something I loved about golf is that
73:45 - you're out in nature I mean these golf
73:47 - courses maybe are artificially green and
73:50 - and have wasted a lot of water and these
73:52 - types of things but from the human
73:54 - perception perspective it's quiet it's
73:56 - relax I mean maybe not relaxing if
73:58 - you're like playing competitively but
74:00 - you're going for if you're walking
74:02 - you're walking probably around 7 Miles
74:04 - when you're out there uh for around you
74:07 - know 3 and 1 half to 4 and a half 5
74:09 - hours and so that is unbelievably
74:12 - refreshing to me and that's one of the
74:13 - best ways that I was personally getting
74:16 - out in nature and having that time to
74:18 - think so on a in a normal round of golf
74:21 - you really don't spend more than about
74:22 - 10 minutes actually hitting the golf
74:24 - ball
74:25 - most of the time is spent going in
74:27 - between shots and thinking about what
74:28 - you're going to do and so you have a lot
74:30 - of time to be able to smell the roses
74:32 - and and enjoy yourself if you don't take
74:34 - it too seriously yeah awesome well I
74:38 - want to get back to data science but
74:39 - like I think welcome to Texas man it's
74:41 - so so great to have uh another data
74:45 - science uh heavy who has moved here to
74:48 - live among o Texans uh so um I want to
74:52 - talk more practically just for people
74:54 - that are listening who want to get into
74:55 - the field and understand what's going on
74:56 - in the field cuz it's changing and
74:58 - evolving very quickly uh what are some
75:01 - of the biggest misconceptions you see
75:04 - people coming into data science
75:07 - with misconceptions coming into data
75:10 - science like let's say somebody is uh
75:13 - they're like a a statistics major or
75:15 - let's say they're somebody who uh used
75:18 - to be you know working in retail and
75:19 - they learned to code and they've been
75:21 - working as a software developer for like
75:23 - a year or two and they're interested in
75:25 - taking their career into a data science
75:28 - Direction so I I think let's even back
75:32 - up so someone that's coming out of
75:34 - college or high school that wants to be
75:35 - a data scientist something I really
75:38 - struggle with and one of the reasons
75:40 - I've switched more to podcasting content
75:43 - than more traditional data science
75:45 - content on my main YouTube channel is
75:48 - that for some reason people think that
75:50 - data science Landing a data science role
75:53 - is like this unbel able Holy Grail this
75:57 - this perfect position where you make a
75:59 - ton of money and you have this great
76:01 - life and all these types of things and
76:04 - while data science work can be fun and
76:06 - rewarding it isn't the end right you
76:09 - don't just get a job and your life is
76:11 - over and perfect you have to continue to
76:14 - work you have to do the work on the job
76:16 - you have to manage office politics you
76:19 - have to work in the specific domain and
76:22 - work on projects you might not enjoy or
76:23 - you might not be super comfortable with
76:26 - there is there's drawbacks to every
76:29 - single um opportunity that you have in
76:33 - life I think data science can be an
76:35 - incredible career and a great stepping
76:36 - stone you can learn a lot you can make
76:38 - good money but a lot of people uh
76:41 - especially college students they think
76:43 - that everything is going to be solved
76:45 - when they land a job at whatever company
76:48 - that they want to do and that simply
76:51 - isn't the case I think that you have to
76:53 - think a little bit more long term to be
76:55 - able to have uh uh like a happier life
77:00 - because if if you don't you're going to
77:02 - land this job and then there's this
77:04 - what's next thing that happens and that
77:06 - happened to me is that oh my God I
77:08 - landed this job I thought I'd be so
77:10 - happy and then the job isn't necessarily
77:13 - what I thought it was what why do I have
77:15 - motivation to continue to work I already
77:17 - achieved the thing that I wanted and so
77:19 - thinking about things from a larger
77:21 - perspective of hey what what would I
77:22 - like to do uh with my with my life not
77:26 - just with my job or or or what would I
77:30 - like to do this year uh that can help
77:32 - you figure out where to go with that
77:35 - data science job and after that data
77:37 - science job and you know it isn't
77:39 - specifically related to The Domain but
77:41 - it is related to the career and that is
77:43 - one of the biggest problems that I see
77:45 - is there's a ton of attrition and and
77:48 - probably to the fault of myself for
77:50 - putting out um a ton of content around
77:53 - why data science is a good field to work
77:55 - in um I still believe it is but
77:58 - inherently different roles are different
78:00 - different people are different and you
78:02 - know data science might not be for
78:03 - everyone right there are some aspects of
78:05 - the coding or the problem solving or the
78:08 - autonomy that that you're awarded in the
78:10 - job that don't necessarily resonate with
78:12 - everyone but there's definitely roles
78:14 - that yeah those those people would be
78:17 - perfectly happy in just maybe not data
78:19 - science or maybe not software
78:20 - engineering or maybe not pro uh product
78:23 - management there there's these different
78:25 - you know that what I should say maybe to
78:28 - sum this all up is
78:29 - introspection before action especially
78:33 - in your career is probably pretty
78:36 - important excellent uh and I think that
78:40 - that is resonant because i' I meet so
78:42 - many people that like went to law school
78:44 - for example and found out after going
78:48 - very into debt and spending like you
78:49 - know an extra four years and maybe extra
78:52 - years doing like clarking and and uh
78:54 - other sort of Association ships that
78:56 - they didn't like doing it and what do
78:59 - you do when you're in that circumstance
79:00 - we've had lots of guests on the free
79:02 - Camp podcast who who've realized you
79:04 - know in in their mid 20s sometimes in
79:05 - their mid-30s or 40s that like they're
79:08 - not going where they want to go and they
79:09 - don't really like their work and they
79:10 - want to do something completely
79:11 - differently so introspection before
79:14 - action especially when it comes to
79:16 - careers um that's a that's a great
79:18 - insight and
79:20 - um if somebody wanted to get into the
79:23 - field based on like obviously you're
79:25 - very candid about the fact that you
79:27 - learned to code and you learned to do
79:28 - data science and all this stuff like
79:30 - more than 10 years ago and you're not
79:32 - that you don't have that beginner's
79:34 - mindset perfectly preserved in like
79:37 - Amber in your mind somewhere that you
79:39 - can just go tap in and like okay what
79:40 - was it like back in the day you have
79:42 - probably vague memories that have been
79:43 - like as you said like glost over by time
79:46 - and and uh you probably look with ro
79:49 - rose-colored glasses at some aspects of
79:51 - learning to code and so you might have
79:53 - like a romantic perspective of that I'm
79:55 - certainly guilty of uh as opposed to
79:57 - like uh like you may not remember all
79:59 - the time that you just like had some
80:02 - sort of like banging my head on my
80:04 - keyboard when I forgot a semicolon yeah
80:07 - uh so if people wanted to get into the
80:10 - field which again I still think it is a
80:12 - good a great field to get into if you
80:14 - know if if it suits you and you're
80:15 - interested in it the the biggest thing
80:19 - now I think this is very are are a good
80:23 - idea anymore and I I could see the blood
80:27 - rushing out of your face qu see no I'm
80:29 - just kidding but what what I recommend
80:31 - now is actually Building Products so the
80:33 - difference between a project and a
80:36 - product is that a project you're
80:38 - building it just for yourself you're
80:40 - trying to create some insight in a
80:42 - product you're building things for other
80:43 - people to use and I think that that's a
80:46 - big shift in the data science world a
80:49 - big shift in the overall engineering
80:51 - world is that with the AI tools with the
80:53 - advancements in technology ology it's a
80:55 - lot easier to build things that other
80:57 - people can use than it used to be you
80:59 - have things like streamlit you have
81:00 - things like uh shiny for python you have
81:03 - all these different tools to make things
81:04 - useful to other people and you also
81:07 - should be sharing your work that's the
81:08 - best way to one get feedback but also to
81:11 - get recognized by employers or whatever
81:13 - it might be so just constantly
81:16 - building is more important than
81:19 - necessarily learning the fundamentals or
81:22 - the the Frameworks if you can build
81:24 - something you'll
81:26 - intuitively um you'll intuitively pick
81:29 - up how these things work at a base level
81:31 - I'm not saying you shouldn't learn the
81:32 - fundamentals I think that they're very
81:33 - important but
81:36 - you understand what the fundamentals are
81:39 - a lot better if you actually have to
81:41 - construct something to begin with um and
81:43 - so I think that there's sort of this
81:45 - balance approach where you learn some
81:46 - fundamentals you build stuff you learn
81:48 - some more fundamentals you build stuff
81:50 - and you sort of uh Weevil wavel back and
81:52 - forth till you have really built some
81:56 - really cool stuff and you and you're
81:57 - able to um you you're able to create
82:01 - opportunities for yourself in in the job
82:03 - market awesome so that's like just to
82:06 - encapsulate that device build products
82:09 - not projects because products have kind
82:12 - of like an outward focus on like an end
82:13 - user who's going to pick up what you
82:15 - built and use it for something like the
82:17 - difference between just having a GitHub
82:19 - repo where you've got a bunch of code
82:21 - and you do your data analysis and you
82:23 - look at like all right I'm done I'm
82:24 - going to move on no instead go on kaggle
82:26 - and and build like you know essentially
82:28 - like a a I guess a they're called
82:31 - projects on Cagle but but essentially
82:33 - like have a narrative of like what you
82:35 - did and what sequence so people can like
82:37 - look at it and learn from it and maybe
82:39 - clean a data set and put it up there so
82:40 - other people can use it uh and and you
82:42 - can think of that as a product free Cod
82:44 - camps curriculum is very project
82:46 - oriented but we make it a very clear
82:48 - point that like there's a difference
82:49 - between projects You're Building to
82:50 - learn uh you know kind of step by step
82:53 - and then there's like open-ended
82:54 - certification projects that you have to
82:55 - build and get all the test to pass to
82:57 - earn the certification but then there's
82:59 - the actual personal projects which you
83:02 - could view as products essentially you
83:04 - should have like a big overarching
83:06 - problem you want to solve whether that's
83:08 - like some sort of analytical engine for
83:11 - like under understanding like baseball
83:14 - statistics that are published through
83:15 - some API or something right like so that
83:17 - you can have a website where people can
83:18 - go and check see like at a glimpse like
83:21 - a dashboard where like they can see the
83:23 - performance of you know a player on
83:25 - their little league or something like
83:26 - that I'm not sure if that's available
83:28 - but like something that people like even
83:30 - if it's just a few people would actually
83:32 - use that can really inform your
83:35 - development and it can give you kind of
83:36 - a North star so you're not just
83:37 - thrashing like maybe it'd be cool to add
83:39 - this no like people are asking me to add
83:41 - this so I can add this um I I definitely
83:44 - like that that focus on creating an
83:47 - artifact that other people are going to
83:48 - actually be able to use and then there's
83:50 - like that feedback loop of of you know
83:53 - maintaining it and extending it um not
83:55 - just based on we talk about this all the
83:57 - time on the podcast but not just
83:59 - following your own Flights of Fancy but
84:01 - actually you know getting actual real
84:04 - world feedback um yeah yeah I agree and
84:08 - I should clarify I think projects have
84:10 - absolutely use case in the learning
84:12 - process if you just write a simple line
84:14 - of code you copy one line of code and
84:16 - you run it in whatever ID you're using
84:19 - that to me is a project right you're
84:22 - you're experimenting you're trying to do
84:23 - those things that's an integral part of
84:24 - learning but if we're talking about
84:26 - getting a job we're talking about
84:28 - thinking about making that transition
84:31 - from learner to practitioner I think the
84:34 - project to
84:36 - product paradigm shift is a really
84:39 - important one because in Industry when
84:41 - are you ever writing code that someone
84:43 - else is not going to use or some other
84:44 - system is not going to use and to me
84:46 - that's a very important distinction
84:49 - there's one thing to write code for
84:51 - oursel to learn and to use and there's
84:53 - another thing to write code that that is
84:56 - essentially almost always going to
84:57 - interact with other people or other
84:59 - systems right yeah 100% um do you have
85:03 - any cool War stories that you could
85:06 - share from just like mistakes you've
85:07 - made over the years uh doing data
85:11 - science that's a good question um yeah I
85:15 - think you something with my work is that
85:19 - we work usually with professional
85:21 - athletes or
85:22 - coaches and so
85:24 - when we're working with these groups we
85:27 - have to remember that they come from
85:29 - very different backgrounds than we do
85:31 - they could they generally are really
85:33 - intelligent they work and they
85:36 - understand GF for their doain
85:38 - unbelievably well but the idea that they
85:42 - will necessarily understand the analysis
85:44 - that we do they'll that they'll
85:47 - necessarily understand a specific type
85:49 - of graph if we show it to them that's
85:52 - not an assumption that we can say make
85:55 - they they've indexed really heavily on
85:56 - being good at golf or being good at
85:58 - basketball or being good at whatever it
86:00 - is they haven't indexed in the same way
86:02 - on being really good at statistics or uh
86:05 - interpreting graphs or any of these
86:07 - types of things so when when we're
86:09 - approaching our clients and trying to
86:11 - explain our work you know how do you
86:12 - explain a mon Carlo simulation to a
86:15 - professional golfer how do you explain
86:17 - uh C's clustering or or uh that this
86:21 - model came out of XYZ neural net that we
86:23 - were using
86:24 - that is a very difficult challenge that
86:28 - that we faced is just the ability to
86:30 - explain in real terms or in in golf
86:34 - terms some of these types of models and
86:37 - Analysis that we're using so it's hard
86:39 - to get by and if people don't understand
86:40 - what you're talking about and so as much
86:43 - as it's a fun engineering problem in our
86:47 - work a lot of it is a communication
86:50 - opportunity as well to be able to speak
86:52 - in the terms of whoever you're working
86:54 - with so that's something that I've
86:56 - struggled with historically and we're
86:58 - showing graphs showing all these
87:00 - different simulations and the different
87:02 - um like the the bootstrap standard
87:04 - deviation of the of the of the results
87:08 - and maybe that's not the best approach
87:09 - it's definitely what we've learned um
87:13 - but for anyone that that's working in a
87:14 - specific domain if you have these domain
87:16 - experts and you have some domain
87:18 - knowledge it's probably better to
87:20 - explain things in their terms rather
87:23 - than your statistic iCal terms if they
87:25 - want to know the details of the analysis
87:27 - great but does it really benefit them
87:31 - for you to go through uh all of this
87:34 - painstaking
87:36 - detail uh
87:38 - around any of the relevant uh metrics
87:41 - that they might not understand like
87:43 - what's the point you're you're wasting
87:44 - both of your your time and so that that
87:46 - has been a huge lesson for me is know
87:49 - your audience and try to speak their
87:50 - language can you think of any like
87:52 - specific instance you don't need to say
87:53 - the name of the athlete or anything like
87:54 - that but like an instance where you
87:57 - learned something where maybe you
87:59 - presumed too much or or you just didn't
88:02 - have the ability to communicate in a way
88:04 - that resonated with them yeah I I think
88:07 - something that I hadn't really thought
88:09 - of uh in a long time is that like
88:11 - percentiles the idea of a
88:13 - percentile can be pretty complex
88:16 - actually so people think in terms of
88:19 - percentages so they might think that hey
88:21 - like uh you know if they're 90th
88:24 - percentile that means there's a 90%
88:26 - chance of something happen I could see
88:28 - where that would be a a logical leap but
88:32 - percentiles and percentages they can
88:34 - mean very different things um you know
88:37 - they're not probabil percentiles are not
88:39 - probabilities and that could be
88:41 - something if you're communicating that
88:43 - could be um that could hang that could
88:46 - hang up on some people and so we we've
88:47 - had to clarify language like that
88:50 - specifically um I I I I don't want to
88:53 - get too much into detail into that but
88:55 - that is that is an area where you could
88:56 - see hey like um not having a statistics
89:00 - background not having like a like that
89:03 - great a grasp of that concept uh would
89:06 - be really difficult it's the same thing
89:07 - for like a um you know if we're talking
89:10 - in golf language you know like what is
89:14 - an um you know like a I'm trying to
89:17 - think of what what a corollary would be
89:20 - but you know the like understanding uh
89:23 - angle of attack versus D plane like
89:25 - people might be really confused about
89:28 - what those two things are I don't even
89:29 - really conceptually understand what they
89:30 - are but a golf instructor would be like
89:32 - oh that's so easy to explain these
89:33 - different things but they look kind of
89:35 - the same on on like a piece of paper to
89:37 - me so I it's it's understanding the
89:40 - domain and it's you know it's not a it's
89:43 - an a completely understandable uh
89:47 - differentiation uh to make as well in
89:49 - that case it's just that we have to be
89:51 - better thinking about okay could this be
89:54 - be misconstrued yeah yeah uh like like a
89:58 - a I guess a common software development
90:01 - uh Coral are that a lot of people might
90:04 - encounter maybe they're at a dinner
90:05 - party and they're like oh I'm a
90:07 - JavaScript developer and the other
90:09 - person will be like oh uh I took a Java
90:11 - class in high school not knowing that
90:13 - jav you know JavaScript and Java Java
90:16 - Java is to JavaScript what car is the
90:18 - carpet yeah as they say right like uh
90:22 - they're they're two different things but
90:23 - but it's like
90:25 - it's almost like people's existing
90:27 - understanding of how percentages work
90:29 - got in the way of them understanding the
90:31 - notion of like percentiles um so so just
90:35 - little things that can you can easily
90:37 - work around that if you just word things
90:38 - differently but you have to know to work
90:41 - around that um yeah like like there
90:43 - there are like false cognets when you're
90:45 - learning a foreign language uh for
90:47 - example like there are words that look
90:49 - just like English words so you might be
90:50 - inclined to think that they're the same
90:51 - word but they're actually totally
90:53 - different that language is just a
90:54 - coincidence that they're the same word
90:56 - right uh so so kind of like structuring
90:59 - your thinking and structuring your
91:00 - approach through a product to
91:02 - communicate things without over
91:04 - complicating it without having to pull
91:06 - somebody aside and have like a whole
91:07 - sidebar about like okay let's explain
91:09 - how this works and this works and this
91:10 - work like they just want to know at the
91:12 - end of the day what they can do to
91:13 - improve right I I mean maybe it's it's a
91:15 - lot more than that but I presume that
91:17 - athletes they want to be the best golfer
91:20 - they can be and learning a whole bunch
91:21 - of stats that time could probably spent
91:24 - working on their swing or or you know so
91:27 - just practicing right U maybe maybe
91:29 - there are some concepts are there any
91:31 - like statistical Concepts that just like
91:33 - living your life that you wish more
91:35 - people were aware of um like are there
91:39 - like any like do you see people make
91:41 - mistakes with like probability time and
91:43 - time again like but if they just took a
91:46 - moment to actually understand like some
91:48 - facet of product uh of probability or
91:51 - statistics they could like really do
91:54 - themselves a huge
91:56 - favor I'm sure there are some but I
91:59 - can't think of one off the top of my
92:01 - head right now let me um I'll try to get
92:04 - back to on that one yeah like
92:05 - correlation and causation it obviously
92:08 - that comes up all the time the lay
92:11 - person might not understand the
92:13 - difference between two things being
92:15 - correlated and may think causality right
92:17 - hence superstitions right like um well
92:22 - something that that I like is like
92:24 - Optimal stopping problem optimal
92:26 - stopping problem yeah so essentially if
92:29 - you're hiring or you're trying to find a
92:32 - partner or whatever it is the math Nets
92:35 - out that you should probably stop around
92:39 - 33% of the way through your search and
92:42 - choose the next candidate who is better
92:45 - than all of the previous
92:47 - candidates um that is I I don't remember
92:51 - exactly how the math works there's this
92:53 - book called algorithms to live by I
92:55 - think that's what it is or it's how to
92:56 - not be wrong one of those two books and
92:59 - effectively that is the way
93:00 - to um to optimize and maximize getting
93:06 - the best candidate in a scenario like
93:08 - that so a lot of people think that they
93:10 - have to go all the way through it or
93:12 - like job hunting or uh hiring or any of
93:16 - these things are difficult problems but
93:17 - to me that's there's like actually a
93:19 - quantifiable way to get
93:21 - probabilistically the best candidate
93:23 - interesting so so just to make sure like
93:25 - all the job Seekers out there are
93:26 - probably going to be really upset about
93:27 - this but if this is true like if you're
93:29 - a hiring manager and you get 500
93:32 - applications you should just look at you
93:34 - know onethird of 500 um and you should
93:37 - basically stop there and just choose
93:39 - your best candidate because no no you
93:41 - choose the best candidate after that
93:42 - oneir after you throw away that one/
93:45 - third and then the next best candidate
93:47 - that's better than anyone in that
93:49 - onethird is the one that you would take
93:51 - ah interesting okay okay now I can see
93:53 - how it works okay I mean in theory
93:55 - that's not how the job market precisely
93:56 - Works in dating it's probably more of a
93:58 - coral are right where um you're getting
94:02 - the most return on your time uh because
94:05 - looking at the remaining 2/3 is going to
94:07 - take you know three times as long as
94:09 - you've already spent but finding another
94:11 - person who's better than those might
94:13 - only be you know uh few more terms uh a
94:16 - few more uh iterations right precisely
94:19 - yeah and and it does sound really cold
94:21 - and weird when applied to like the the
94:23 - labor market are certainly applied
94:25 - toward trying to Rel partner you know
94:29 - but that's math right math doesn't care
94:32 - about your feelings I'm I'm not saying
94:34 - that people should do this I'm saying
94:36 - that it's a useful tool if you were like
94:39 - trying to perfectly optimize for time
94:42 - spent and but but like that's not how
94:45 - any of these things work in practicality
94:47 - that's how another thing I'll also say
94:48 - is that you know in in the real world
94:51 - where there's infinite variables simple
94:55 - heuristics can be I mean statistics can
94:58 - actually be a heuristic rather than a um
95:04 - like a like a factual thing right
95:06 - because the statistics we use a lot of
95:08 - the time don't incorporate all of the
95:11 - data that is available in human
95:12 - interactions and dating and any of these
95:14 - types of things so uh that's another
95:17 - thing that I've learned about statistics
95:19 - is like yes that they're relevant um
95:23 - what there's almost always things that
95:25 - we can't quantify and so using you know
95:30 - taking everything with a grain of Sal is
95:31 - is pretty important as well yeah I mean
95:34 - like any complex system you're going to
95:36 - have a model and that model is an
95:37 - oversimplification of that complex
95:39 - system right so when you say the word
95:41 - heris I just want to make sure everybody
95:43 - in the audience knows what this term
95:45 - heris means it's basically like a mental
95:47 - shortcut essentially or like a rule of
95:49 - thumb which does not mean what it they
95:51 - say it means in Boondock STS it's not
95:53 - about like spousal abuse the term has no
95:57 - association with that so I will not you
95:59 - know not use the term rule of thumb
96:01 - because it it's just like a weird movie
96:03 - thing um okay so so like a heuristic
96:06 - like essentially a rule of thumb uh kind
96:08 - of like a tool that you can use to save
96:10 - yourself a whole bunch of time and
96:12 - energy doing exhaustive search um so
96:16 - you're saying that a lot of Statistics
96:19 - applied is not like if you were to talk
96:22 - to like I guess like U somebody who was
96:26 - obsessed with getting the 100% accurate
96:29 - like state-of-the-art response you could
96:32 - save yourself a whole lot of that work
96:34 - and get a good enough answer so to speak
96:37 - by applying statistics as a
96:39 - heuristic yeah I it's very often I mean
96:43 - let's think about it heuristic can be a
96:46 - statistic right so let's say um we're
96:50 - trying to determine if someone can like
96:53 - bench press a certain amount and maybe
96:56 - there would be like an age heuristic
96:58 - that we'd use and so technically that is
96:59 - a statistic as well
97:02 - right um if we add additional attributes
97:06 - to it the more uh like Advanced we make
97:09 - the model the less of a heuristic it is
97:13 - because the heuristics are based on the
97:15 - sort of like either gut feeling or the
97:17 - shortcut but still both of those are
97:19 - statistics and I think a lot of people
97:20 - don't realize that hey there's in
97:23 - Whenever there is still a gap in
97:25 - information it is technically heuristic
97:27 - the machine learning models we use all
97:29 - of these types of things in my opinion
97:31 - are technically still largely heuristic
97:33 - models they're just significantly more
97:36 - refined than just highlevel heuristics
97:39 - yeah um and I don't think people realize
97:42 - that there is a scale uh that these
97:44 - things operate on uh so like the highest
97:47 - level might be that age heuristic it
97:50 - would be less of a heuristic the more
97:51 - refined we make it and the more more
97:53 - specific it gets but if it's not 100%
97:56 - technically it is like a heuristic model
97:59 - right yeah awesome uh could you like
98:01 - talk a little bit closer to your mic
98:03 - like it the volume just dropped a little
98:04 - bit sorry about that okay I didn't want
98:06 - to interrupt your flow okay so so uh one
98:09 - of the things that you said uh on your
98:11 - podcast one of your recent podcast
98:13 - episodes I listened to a bunch of them
98:14 - in preparation for this interview that
98:16 - really jumped out of me is like being
98:17 - really interesting is that um there's a
98:21 - danger in taking other people's
98:22 - humanistics
98:24 - uh and applying them without
98:26 - understanding how they arrived at those
98:29 - heuristics and it's often much better to
98:31 - just grapple with it yourself and create
98:33 - your own humoristic than it is to use
98:36 - somebody else's so like don't take
98:38 - somebody else's humanistic of face value
98:41 - and try to apply them to your own work
98:43 - why do you believe
98:45 - this uh so I think in the world we live
98:50 - in it's it's becoming more and more of a
98:53 - mass customization world and let's take
98:56 - a biology example where if I take a
99:00 - certain supplement and someone else
99:02 - takes a certain supplement we might have
99:04 - varying uh reactions to it someone it
99:07 - might do really great things for them
99:09 - and may make their G really comfortable
99:11 - but if I take it it makes me feel really
99:14 - bad um and that could be for a whole
99:17 - host of reasons it could be that hey I
99:19 - have different genetics it could be that
99:21 - I have a whole completely different gut
99:22 - microbi iome that impacts my sensitivity
99:25 - to supplements or all these different
99:27 - things there are these individualized
99:29 - factors in all of our problems that
99:34 - um that that can lead to very different
99:36 - effects from the same inputs so to Me
99:41 - Maybe if it has helped a lot of people
99:43 - and say oh this helps 80% of people it's
99:45 - worth experimenting with but I should
99:47 - still validate the results on myself
99:49 - because my unique situation is different
99:51 - I don't see this as being different for
99:53 - companies or different different for
99:55 - athletes or whoever it is there has to
99:57 - be that level of individual
100:00 - experimentation to make sure that things
100:02 - are fit you can't again take this on
100:03 - face value and assume it'll work I see
100:06 - this with for example content all the
100:07 - time so you go and you look at uh Mr
100:10 - Beast who has is by far the most
100:13 - successful YouTuber of all time he
100:15 - creates thumbnails that are very like
100:17 - emotional they're very uh whizbang
100:20 - there's they're very clear but me
100:23 - creating that type of thumbnail for
100:25 - educational content would not work
100:27 - because what the user is expecting to
100:31 - get does not match the content of the
100:33 - video so you know if if you look at the
100:36 - unique situation if you have something
100:38 - that is more relevant to education that
100:40 - thumbnail will be more likely to be
100:41 - clicked by the audience because it
100:44 - resonates with the message of the
100:46 - content as well as the content itself
100:48 - and it'll lead to better outcomes so if
100:50 - you were to say oh just make it how Mr
100:51 - Beast does it that isn't going to line
100:54 - up from uh from a conceptual or
100:58 - analytical perspective at a certain
101:00 - point in time so I think that there's uh
101:04 - there there is that again introspection
101:06 - that we have to do on ourselves or our
101:08 - business but there's also uh that
101:10 - understanding of of like of the matching
101:13 - and and the small data associated with
101:15 - ourselves that we have to be evaluating
101:16 - as well yeah 100% And and I can talk
101:20 - anecdotally about very that very thing
101:22 - because you
101:24 - and and you know your YouTube channel is
101:27 - quite big and you you've had a lot of
101:29 - very popular uh educational videos and
101:31 - it's very hard to get people to click on
101:34 - and actually watch something that's good
101:35 - for them right it's hard to get your
101:37 - kids to eat their vegetables take their
101:38 - vitamins when they could just be eating
101:40 - you know Cocoa Puffs or Pop-Tarts or
101:43 - whatever right but but uh yeah a lot of
101:47 - people ask me like Quincy why don't you
101:48 - make the free Coke cam thumbnails pop
101:51 - why don't you make them more like uh Mr
101:53 - beast and and have like the the YouTuber
101:55 - face and like you know like all the
101:57 - arrows and circles and all those
101:59 - different tricks that people use but
102:01 - like with YouTube you actually don't
102:03 - want people who aren't going to like
102:05 - your video to click on your video it
102:06 - penalizes you for getting have if you
102:09 - have like a really high clickr rate but
102:10 - a really low watch time that video is
102:13 - heading downward like it's not going to
102:15 - be recommended to very many people it's
102:16 - much better to have a like with
102:18 - education to have an extremely literal
102:20 - thumbnail like the kind that Bo K
102:22 - creates for YouTube uh for free C games
102:24 - YouTube where it's just like you know um
102:26 - our programming in 10 hours or something
102:30 - like that or 10 10 hour course or
102:31 - something like that and it's just like
102:33 - the r logo like we found that that works
102:35 - a lot better in terms of getting a video
102:38 - to like actually do well than trying to
102:40 - like jazz it up and Mr Beast eyes
102:43 - it uh maybe we could talk a little bit
102:45 - about your career as a Creator uh I have
102:48 - a lot of other data science and AI
102:50 - questions and do you still have time
102:52 - yeah yeah I I should let me double check
102:54 - real quick but I think we're uh yeah we
102:57 - blocked out two hours for this but like
102:59 - yeah we're good we're good I'm I'm was
103:00 - so fun talking to you if it's cool I
103:02 - just want to keep keep firing these away
103:03 - it's not every day you get to sit down
103:05 - with Kenji so iy Quincy you just got to
103:07 - move a little closer yeah I I got to get
103:09 - get down there to Austin we got to go
103:11 - get some uh some some food together get
103:14 - some barbecue all right so um let's talk
103:17 - about creation like you've been doing
103:19 - this podcast for so long uh You've Got
103:22 - You Are are incredibly prolific you're
103:24 - incredibly consistent and uh and now you
103:27 - have a second podcast as well which it
103:28 - sounds like I haven't listened to it yet
103:30 - but it sounds like it's a a different
103:31 - format of you going really deep um what
103:35 - would you advise someone to do if they
103:37 - wanted to create educational content or
103:39 - science content uh like like what are
103:42 - some of the things that you've learned
103:43 - on your own journey and and what I guess
103:46 - got you to upload your first video to
103:48 - YouTube to begin with so my first video
103:52 - was for a a class project that I did so
103:55 - when I was in grad school we had to do a
103:57 - little
103:58 - presentation and I had
104:02 - compared two different types of
104:04 - recurrent neural Nets to predict crypto
104:08 - prices and it took me five minutes to
104:11 - make a video and it was an online course
104:13 - so I just uploaded it didn't think
104:16 - anything of it shared the link I didn't
104:18 - realize you could make unlisted videos
104:19 - or anything along along those at that
104:21 - point in time so I just made it public
104:23 - and then I look back three four months
104:26 - later and it had a thousand views at the
104:28 - time and to me that was a ton of views I
104:29 - was like Wow people are interested in
104:31 - this like this this is I'll take note of
104:33 - that and then a little bit later I was
104:37 - Landing my first kind of internship
104:40 - enroll out of grad school and I'd gone
104:44 - from management consulting into data
104:47 - science and there was absolutely no road
104:49 - map for how I could do that and so I'd
104:52 - gone through this process and I was like
104:54 - well maybe I should build this road map
104:56 - so it could help other people going for
104:59 - I already have this YouTube channel that
105:01 - I had published this one video on I
105:03 - might as well put that up there and see
105:05 - if there's any traction and that did
105:06 - okay and then I said wow I really like
105:08 - making these videos I I like educating
105:11 - uh there was also a point in time where
105:12 - I did an interview where I had to just
105:15 - talk into a
105:16 - camera and I it was a prompted question
105:20 - I just recorded my answer and it was
105:23 - unbelievable I watched it back and I was
105:27 - like man I don't even want this job
105:29 - anymore
105:30 - and I realized that one of the best ways
105:33 - to help improve my communication skills
105:36 - was to record myself on video and watch
105:38 - it back and so I said why not I'll I'll
105:41 - do that it'll be a good way I can spread
105:43 - information I thought was useful and I
105:44 - can also improve my interpersonal skills
105:48 - in this way and so it started like that
105:51 - and it just continued to snowball I
105:53 - realized I really liked making videos I
105:55 - like storytelling YouTube is very
105:58 - interesting because it is a data problem
106:01 - so you get all of your metrics for the
106:03 - videos you have the clickthrough reads
106:04 - you have all these things and there's
106:05 - all these different things that you can
106:06 - tweak so to me that was a really fun
106:09 - exercise as well and then during the
106:11 - pandemic there was a massive surge for
106:15 - in um an interest in remote jobs and
106:17 - data science and these types of domains
106:19 - and the channel really ended up taking
106:21 - off more and as as part of that I was
106:24 - trying to produce a lot of content I was
106:26 - making three videos a week and one of
106:29 - the types of videos is I was just inter
106:31 - interviewing people in the field and I
106:33 - realized that I like that even more than
106:34 - making normal videos so a podcast to me
106:38 - one you get a meet another really
106:40 - interesting person you get to sit down
106:41 - and have an in-depth hourong
106:43 - conversation with them and it's also
106:46 - easier content to make you have to spend
106:48 - an hour maybe 30 minutes before
106:51 - preparing and an hour talking
106:54 - and you get this content that people are
106:57 - ready to consume already and I said wow
106:59 - that that actually makes a lot of sense
107:00 - why don't I index a little bit more
107:02 - towards that uh one because I enjoyed it
107:05 - arguably more than uh putting together a
107:08 - YouTube video and it was also Contra to
107:12 - the uh kind of
107:14 - snippet uh or short short form sort of
107:18 - phase that we're going through yeah I'm
107:20 - a believer that Nuance is really
107:22 - important
107:23 - and going into detail is really
107:25 - important and in the short form world we
107:27 - live in we're making everything about
107:30 - these highlights and if you live your
107:32 - life by highlights you're not going to
107:33 - get very far because that there's always
107:36 - like the devil is in the details in in
107:38 - in almost everything so I view
107:40 - podcasting I view my new podcast as a
107:42 - way to go really deep into the details
107:44 - which is where the true Insight is found
107:47 - in my opinion yeah 100% And like with
107:49 - Tik Tok and with YouTube shorts and even
107:52 - with like you know some of these short
107:54 - form articles that you read like you
107:56 - know pop science type magazines and
107:59 - stuff like that like to some extent
108:02 - you're just information grazing you're
108:04 - you're just kind of like oh this is
108:05 - information this is content with a
108:07 - lowercase C right um and I love long
108:11 - form conversations like this and I find
108:14 - them so valuable and I listen to hours
108:15 - of this stuff every week like I probably
108:17 - listened to I listen to everything at
108:19 - Double speed so I probably listened like
108:21 - two or three hours of podcast type
108:23 - conversation every single day it's like
108:25 - a huge part of my information diet while
108:27 - I'm walking around and getting exercise
108:28 - or while I'm uh you know I'll take the
108:31 - kids to the park and they'll be on the
108:32 - monkey bars and I'll just kind of walk
108:33 - laps around the playground area right
108:35 - and uh I find this incredibly useful
108:38 - because if you think about it
108:39 - practically like what are the odds that
108:41 - I'm going to be able to have an in-depth
108:44 - conversation with somebody like Kenji
108:46 - regularly right um uh am I going to meet
108:49 - him at a dinner party is is he actually
108:51 - going to focus on talking just a me for
108:53 - this long am I going to be able to you
108:55 - know and then so you're doing research
108:58 - uh before you even sit down and talk
109:00 - with these guests that you've had on um
109:03 - and as a result you're like much better
109:05 - prepared than you would be even in some
109:07 - casual like oh you're at some party and
109:09 - you walk into the kitchen to get uh you
109:11 - know uh some ordes and and there's like
109:13 - this person standing there and you start
109:15 - talking like the amount of depth you can
109:17 - get in a podcast conversation especially
109:20 - when when you're doing things like
109:21 - defining uh terms for the for La
109:24 - audience and things like that like it
109:26 - it's an incredible learning tool and I
109:28 - really wish podcasting was around when I
109:30 - was a kid because I think I would be so
109:33 - much smarter and more interesting than I
109:35 - am today if I'd grown up doing this uh
109:38 - so so yeah I just want to emphasize that
109:40 - like if anybody's listening to this and
109:42 - they're thinking like oh there's already
109:43 - too many podcasts out in the world who
109:45 - has time in the day like I spent a huge
109:46 - amount of time I listened to dozens of
109:48 - different podcasts maybe hundreds of
109:49 - podcasts over the span of a year and uh
109:52 - a different podcast like RSS feeds um
109:56 - it's amazing also if you're watching
109:57 - this on YouTube there are RSS feeds you
110:00 - can just listen to Apple podcast you can
110:02 - listen to Spotify you don't have to use
110:03 - as much data um uh definitely I
110:07 - encourage you to subscribe to uh Ken
110:10 - nearest neighbors and to the exponential
110:12 - athlete podcast as well um super
110:16 - insightful like like I'm very excited
110:18 - about listening to the uh exponential
110:21 - athlete uh myself just because uh a lot
110:24 - of these things that I think maybe it'll
110:26 - help me up my fighting game skills like
110:29 - understanding like there might be some
110:30 - ancillary Concepts that I can Port over
110:32 - so yeah well I I love what you said um
110:36 - the way I view it is that you have you
110:39 - like second or first order and second
110:41 - order thinking and I think you can have
110:42 - first order and second order
110:44 - conversations and what I mean by that is
110:46 - first order is or even third order
110:48 - conversations or first order is you're
110:50 - talking about something that is not
110:53 - super Nuance you're talking about the
110:54 - weather you're talking about whatever it
110:55 - is uh a second order is it's a deeper
110:58 - conversation where you have intimate
111:00 - knowledge or you both have intimate
111:01 - knowledge of a spe specific domain and
111:03 - that's where Insight comes from where
111:05 - you can go past the the pleasantries you
111:08 - can go past maybe some of the the highle
111:10 - details and get into where um
111:15 - where you know topics or areas that are
111:18 - unique to each individual person and
111:20 - then third order conversations build on
111:23 - those second order conversations and you
111:24 - get to places there that maybe no one
111:27 - has been before maybe you're talking
111:29 - about a topic in a different way or
111:30 - combining two different disciplines or
111:32 - whatever it might be in this different
111:34 - way and I think that the longer form
111:36 - content allows you to go into those
111:38 - areas and make those deeper insights and
111:40 - to piece things together that might not
111:43 - necessarily be um you know naturally
111:45 - occurring and again that is where
111:47 - Insight happens um and that's something
111:50 - I really love about this also podcasts
111:52 - are great opportunity to talk to
111:54 - unbelievably interesting people you you
111:56 - have the opportunity to have these
111:58 - conversations if you have a podcast you
112:00 - have an a reason to connect with a bunch
112:02 - of interesting people if you have a
112:04 - podcast that's a very different thing as
112:06 - well is you know oh I'm trying to grow
112:07 - my career it'd be great if I could ask
112:10 - all these people who have been
112:11 - successful in this career in in this
112:13 - domain oh wait if I have a podcast I
112:15 - have an excuse to interview them for
112:17 - their time unless they're professional
112:18 - athletes unless they're super
112:19 - high-profile they'll probably give you
112:21 - the time of day too cuz it benefit
112:22 - benefits them as well yeah absolutely uh
112:26 - and one of this is a great way to bridge
112:28 - into AI because AI is not about creating
112:33 - anything truly novel right it's all
112:34 - about like taking stuff that's been fed
112:36 - into it and trying to synthesize
112:38 - something that looks novel but really is
112:40 - you know basic but you've talked a lot
112:42 - about your experiments with llms to
112:44 - create like social media posts and how
112:46 - you ultimately abandoned a lot of that
112:47 - because it's just derivative and it felt
112:50 - like you were just tweeting kind of like
112:52 - a copy of a copy of you know what gp4
112:57 - thinks is like a good tweet um and that
113:00 - you think that podcasts are like almost
113:04 - kind of like the and it's all novel and
113:06 - like this particular sequence of words
113:08 - that I'm saying right now has
113:09 - statistically never been said before
113:11 - right like even if you look at the past
113:13 - 20 words I've said probably right like
113:15 - that sequence of words has probably
113:16 - never been said before so so maybe you
113:20 - could talk about like how we can still
113:22 - create interesting novel content even
113:24 - when we have these kind of like you know
113:27 - uh token predictor type tools that are
113:30 - incredibly powerful and useful but at
113:32 - the same time are not really generating
113:34 - anything novel yeah well it's going to
113:36 - sound like I'm contradicting myself but
113:39 - I promise I'm not so I don't think in
113:41 - the world now if we really view it there
113:43 - isn't really any new ideas necessarily
113:46 - like the core of ideas stays the same
113:49 - how they're applied across different
113:51 - disciplines how they're adapted are
113:54 - where the novelty comes from and I think
113:56 - the problem with aachi BT writing is
114:00 - that it's averaging all of these ideas
114:03 - into something that is similarly
114:05 - replicable so you're not getting the
114:07 - Insight from drawing from all these
114:09 - different disciplines and being able to
114:10 - create this this new application to uh
114:15 - uh to a similar space because of this
114:18 - averaging that these models are doing
114:20 - and I think that that's inherently what
114:22 - the law I think the best writing the
114:24 - best uh tweeting the best podcasting is
114:29 - borrowing for other Concepts and
114:30 - applying them to a new domain so that it
114:32 - isn't novel still but it's more complex
114:36 - and essentially like less average so
114:40 - that it can be useful I don't know if
114:42 - that necessarily makes sense yeah no
114:43 - that totally makes sense there's nothing
114:44 - new Under the Sun but you recombine
114:47 - things I mean if you look at it like
114:49 - there's nothing novel about music like
114:50 - all the musical instruments were
114:51 - invented most of the musical instruments
114:53 - were invented hundreds of years ago and
114:56 - we're just working with the same range
114:57 - of frequency the same like time
114:59 - signatures and stuff like that but you
115:01 - can recombine those fundamental things
115:03 - into all kinds of Creative Expressions
115:06 - and you know AI music is just not going
115:09 - to do quite what like a human composer
115:11 - that has also taken in a huge Corpus but
115:14 - also has that kind of like human
115:16 - instinct for
115:17 - applying uh I would argue that of course
115:21 - like there's some really good AI music
115:23 - out there that keeps getting better and
115:24 - better all the time but I genuinely
115:26 - believe uh as somebody who does compose
115:28 - music from time to time and enjoys music
115:31 - that like it's going to be extremely
115:33 - hard to compose a riff like n Rogers
115:38 - would compose you know and and to get
115:40 - that same charm yes you could feed his
115:42 - entire Corpus of every single Chic song
115:44 - in there and all his Sister Sledge
115:47 - everything like that and put it into a
115:48 - blender and try to be like a now Rogers
115:51 - riff erator but I just if you actually
115:55 - like compared that to what n Rogers sat
115:57 - down and played if you put the two
115:58 - together I think that the results would
116:00 - be like clear um and I think that that
116:03 - maybe maybe that's naive what do you
116:04 - think about that do you think that that
116:05 - is naive well I think that it's you said
116:09 - Nell Roger NY Rogers n Rogers rhythm
116:12 - guitar player from
116:14 - Sheik I think that if he was adapt at
116:19 - prompting and was telling the model what
116:21 - to combine could probably create
116:23 - something that was similar but only only
116:26 - he knows what outside resources he's
116:29 - pulling from where he's getting
116:31 - inspiration from all these different
116:32 - things and to me that is where the the
116:35 - magic happens in these things I mean
116:37 - that the problem again with a chat BT
116:40 - writing blog content for me is that in
116:44 - that circumstance if I ask it to write a
116:46 - LinkedIn post it has all these emojis it
116:48 - has all these like these weird things
116:51 - that are a stereo typical LinkedIn
116:54 - post and a stereotypical LinkedIn post
116:57 - is not necessarily a successful LinkedIn
116:58 - post and the more of the stereotypical
117:01 - LinkedIn posts that we get the more
117:03 - diluted the content is and so the
117:06 - further that I can actually get from a
117:08 - chat GPT LinkedIn post the more it will
117:11 - stand out in the audience's eyes because
117:13 - it's less uniform than the other content
117:16 - uh that's being produced so the more AI
117:18 - content there is out there the more
117:21 - similar the corpus of content is going
117:23 - to be and the more benefit that you have
117:25 - of being and creating original content
117:28 - that's one of the things I love about
117:30 - podcasting is that I I would argue for a
117:34 - normal YouTube video of mine someone
117:36 - could make or replicate it very easily
117:40 - uh they could say all the same things
117:41 - they could probably shoot better camera
117:43 - angles they could make it faceless do
117:46 - whatever it is uh and and replicate that
117:48 - really well it's very hard just as you
117:50 - were saying earlier Quincy to to
117:52 - replicate an entire conversation the
117:54 - randomness in which it goes the
117:56 - personality if it was two robots talking
117:59 - and we didn't have any backstory any
118:01 - lived experience why would there be a
118:03 - reason to tune in to hear that
118:05 - conversation outside of the novelty of
118:07 - two robots talking right what makes the
118:09 - content interesting is the individual
118:11 - stories and the perspectives the humans
118:13 - have uh at least at this point in time
118:15 - unless it's completely fabricated the
118:17 - AIS do not have this Rich backstory of
118:20 - of human history um I'll also say that I
118:24 - think really deeply deep deep research
118:27 - that consolidates a ton of different
118:29 - knowledge is something that AI does not
118:33 - do well at this point in time that might
118:35 - change that's probably more subject to
118:36 - change than the podcast interviews but
118:39 - to me that Corpus of knowledge or
118:41 - organizing a tremendous amount of
118:43 - knowledge into like a you know a 4-Hour
118:45 - episode is something I don't think AI
118:48 - will be doing as effectively as a human
118:50 - in in the short term so for me this long
118:54 - form content again you also create this
118:56 - relationship with the listeners that I
118:58 - think is very hard for an AI to do yeah
119:03 - oh well I think that that's a great
119:05 - point one other place where organic
119:07 - conversations come up a lot that I know
119:09 - you're a big advocate of attending
119:10 - conferences for people that are getting
119:12 - into the space um can you talk about
119:15 - like your passion for conferences and
119:19 - how somebody getting into the field like
119:21 - what they should optimize for in in
119:23 - terms of maybe some specific conferences
119:25 - they should look at for specific
119:28 - types yeah I I think by far the most
119:31 - opportunities that I've had in my career
119:33 - have come through other people I mean
119:35 - after
119:36 - interviewing I'd say it's probably been
119:38 - over a 100 people on the podcast because
119:40 - we have repeat guests and things along
119:42 - those lines even though we're almost at
119:43 - episode 200 one of the common threads is
119:47 - that one or two people has made a
119:50 - profound impact on their individual
119:53 - careers and so in my opinion one of the
119:56 - best ways to meet people that could have
119:58 - a positive impact on your career is
120:00 - through going to conferences through
120:02 - doing coffee meetups through doing
120:04 - unfortunately these things in person if
120:06 - you're a introverted person yeah um
120:10 - fortunately for me is I'm quite
120:12 - extroverted and that extroversion has
120:15 - led me to meeting a lot of people that
120:17 - would help either the podcast the
120:19 - content my professional life uh my
120:22 - personal life any of these types of
120:24 - things and the most high leverage things
120:26 - that I've done uh is in collaboration or
120:30 - meeting uh other people I will also say
120:34 - my best friend um she's introverted very
120:38 - introverted but she has the benefit of
120:40 - having an extroverted friend who
120:42 - introduces her to a lot of different
120:44 - people so you don't necessarily have to
120:46 - be the extrovert yourself but going to
120:48 - conferences is a great way to meet
120:50 - someone who's extroverted that can all
120:52 - you can Outsource all of your super
120:54 - connector exactly somebody who knows
120:56 - everybody like you may know these people
120:58 - they like they just make it a point to
121:00 - like be curious about other people and
121:02 - go out and and meet other people and I
121:04 - aspire to one day be a super connector
121:06 - in terms of just knowing a lot of people
121:07 - in the data Science World the developer
121:09 - world and it sounds like you've you've
121:10 - been able to do that as well through
121:12 - your podcast and through your work uh
121:14 - just meet a broad array of data
121:17 - scientists if if somebody wants to just
121:20 - get like a really good good classic
121:23 - episode of Ken's nearest neighbors
121:25 - they're looking for an interview to
121:26 - listen to is there one that you'd
121:28 - recommend off the top of your head that
121:29 - you're really proud of um let's think
121:32 - here so one more recently that that I
121:35 - thought was really useful I think that
121:37 - the job market in data science is maybe
121:40 - not as great as a lot of people would
121:43 - like right now um I did one with Nick
121:46 - Singh who wrote the book uh I think it's
121:49 - crack the data Ace the data science
121:50 - interview
121:52 - and that has a really good perspective
121:53 - on the landscape and what you can do to
121:55 - get ahead I also did one more recently
121:59 - with Wes mckin who was the uh creator of
122:02 - the pandas library and that was a really
122:05 - informative one about his process and
122:07 - his experience and a little bit of the
122:09 - comparison between open source and the
122:11 - more private nature of some of these AI
122:13 - models that are coming up so I think
122:14 - those would be those would be uh pretty
122:18 - interesting ones for anyone who is new
122:21 - to the podcast
122:22 - awesome well I am going to link to both
122:24 - of those episodes below so once you
122:26 - finish listening to this uh I hope
122:28 - you'll go and listen to even more keni
122:31 - insights as he interviews some of these
122:33 - uh thinkers and doers in the data
122:35 - science space uh Ken I just want to
122:38 - thank you again man for giving me so
122:40 - much of your busy day uh I want to
122:42 - welcome you again to Texas I think it's
122:44 - so cool that you're like a three and a
122:45 - half hour drive away and I definitely
122:47 - want to hang out with you probably at
122:50 - some upcoming conference and and then go
122:52 - get a big meal with you at some point uh
122:56 - cuz yeah I mean I assume like did you
122:59 - eat a lot of good food when you were in
123:00 - Hawaii did you ever I ate a lot of good
123:02 - food yeah but you know there's like I've
123:06 - had enough Pokey for a
123:08 - lifetime uh and so I'm on my my uh
123:13 - TexMex and barbecue era which which I'm
123:16 - perfectly happy about my my waistline is
123:18 - not super happy about that but the my
123:22 - that's not as healthy as poke no
123:24 - unfortunately not but what can you do
123:26 - awesome man well it's been such a
123:28 - pleasure talking with you uh everybody
123:30 - be sure to check the show notes uh be
123:32 - sure to subscribe if you haven't
123:33 - subscribed to the Freo Camp podcast uh
123:36 - and be sure to look for new interviews
123:38 - like this every week coming straight
123:41 - from insightful people like Kenji and
123:44 - again seriously check out the show the
123:46 - show notes and listen to some of Ken's
123:48 - interviews there is one of me I had
123:51 - terrible mic quality I apologize for the
123:53 - quality of my mic before I start switch
123:55 - to like this nice dynamic microphone um
123:58 - and uh but if you want to hear you know
124:00 - the many questions that Ken asked of me
124:03 - very insightful uh I I hope you enjoy
124:05 - that as well and man I just I appreciate
124:08 - everything you're doing for making data
124:10 - science more accessible accessible for
124:13 - folks getting into the field and I
124:15 - appreciate your you know very candid
124:17 - you're not sugar cating anything like
124:19 - you you go there you talk about uh you
124:22 - know the the real challenges people have
124:24 - getting into the field uh the
124:26 - capriciousness of the job market which
124:27 - we're also experiencing in software
124:29 - development as a field but I mean the
124:31 - reality is I I think this field of data
124:34 - science it sounds like of doing machine
124:36 - learning of doing everything that you're
124:37 - doing with um you know math and computer
124:42 - science I I can only imagine it
124:44 - continuing to grow as we become a more I
124:48 - mean can we end on that like like are
124:50 - you pretty optimistic about the future
124:51 - the field yeah absolutely I mean think
124:54 - about what AI needs to be successful you
124:58 - need more data without a doubt I think
125:00 - that there's going to be tremendous
125:02 - opportunities particularly in data
125:04 - engineering to start uh you need the
125:06 - infrastructure to support some of the AI
125:08 - advancements and if you think about it a
125:12 - lot of people are scared about oh is AI
125:14 - going to take my role a lot of these
125:15 - types of things who is more suited who
125:18 - who is most suited uh to excel in a
125:23 - world where AI tools are prominent
125:25 - probably the people who are starting to
125:28 - build them which are data scientists
125:29 - machine learning engineers and these
125:30 - types of people so I I personally
125:33 - Embrace using the tools even though I
125:35 - don't write it for blogging I still I
125:36 - use them a lot to code and and for other
125:38 - things so you know my my thought is that
125:42 - people in the data science domain people
125:44 - who are technically inclined people who
125:46 - are coding are the most prepared to
125:49 - start using these tools for other things
125:52 - and that's an incredible opportunity in
125:54 - my opinion rather than something to
125:56 - necessarily be afraid of awesome thank
125:59 - you again cani everyone thank you and we
126:02 - got to have you we got to have you on uh
126:04 - Ken neighbors again I mean I have the
126:07 - little studio right here so dude I want
126:09 - to actually come there and be an iners
126:11 - episode and I I would love to interview
126:13 - you in person at some point as well
126:15 - would love it awesome well everybody
126:18 - until next week happy coding
