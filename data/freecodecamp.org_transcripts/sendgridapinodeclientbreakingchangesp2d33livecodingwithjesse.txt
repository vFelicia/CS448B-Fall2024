00:06 - hey everybody its Jessie and welcome to
00:09 - live coding with Jessie today we're
00:11 - gonna go back to project two and we're
00:16 - gonna work on that probably just for
00:18 - today and then we'll go back to the
00:19 - other project I think we can we can
00:24 - finish up with what we need to UM
00:25 - project to today so let me let me just
00:33 - explain just for a minute what we're
00:36 - gonna try to do today and then we'll go
00:39 - through it so SendGrid
00:41 - is what we've been using to send mail so
00:45 - I think I I'm pretty sure that I had
00:49 - some streams at least one stream
00:51 - dedicated solely to setting up send grid
00:54 - and sending mail I I was trying to make
01:01 - the emails a little bit nicer looking so
01:04 - I was gonna add some introductory text
01:06 - and before I sent the the form data
01:09 - through email and I wanted to look up
01:12 - with the send grid with the same grid
01:16 - package like what could I do
01:18 - and as I was looking it up I realized
01:21 - this was completely different than the
01:24 - code that I have and so I went back and
01:26 - looked through the changelog and there
01:30 - were a ton of breaking changes so many
01:33 - breaking changes that they actually just
01:36 - completely changed the name of the
01:40 - package the NPM package and everything
01:42 - so we're going to install a new NPM
01:44 - package that's gonna have the new
01:45 - SendGrid API I put a link to the github
01:50 - repo for this in the description for
01:54 - this video so if you want to read more
01:56 - about it you can go there at some point
01:59 - I'll probably be bringing over onto the
02:03 - screen that you all can see at least
02:05 - part of the documentation let's see
02:11 - I think that's pretty much it for for
02:14 - introduction that that sums up what
02:16 - we're gonna try to do
02:17 - let me bring over I had my live chat
02:22 - kind of buried here hey everybody
02:27 - okay Sebastian was in here and said he's
02:31 - submitted a pull request I did see that
02:32 - but then it looks like he had to go he's
02:35 - gonna go to dinner all right so anyway
02:39 - probably later on during the question
02:40 - answer session I'm gonna go over a few
02:42 - pull requests there were at least at
02:45 - least two pull requests that I want to
02:48 - go over so probably the one that
02:50 - Sebastian just submitted this not
02:52 - emerged yet and then we had another one
02:54 - that I emerged earlier today but I'm
02:57 - gonna wait and go over those at the
03:00 - beginning of the question-and-answer
03:01 - session so probably in about an hour
03:04 - okay let's get started
03:08 - so first thing is let's just install
03:11 - this NPM package so if you're not
03:14 - familiar with how to install things
03:16 - let's start our timer if you're not
03:20 - familiar with how to install things with
03:23 - NPM this will be a good introduction so
03:27 - to do this you you need note installed
03:30 - on your machine and NPM assuming that
03:35 - you have that set up then this would be
03:37 - your next step you find so I'm gonna
03:40 - I'll bring this over to show you you
03:42 - find your NPM package so this is NPM j/s
03:48 - calm normally at least for me what it
03:51 - usually happens is I find what I want to
03:53 - use on github and then they'll have
03:56 - instructions to download it on github it
03:59 - just so happened that the SendGrid the
04:01 - home page for the SendGrid node client
04:06 - repo on github doesn't have the
04:08 - instructions so I had to find it on NPM
04:14 - so either way you can find the package
04:17 - on NPM or usually there's github
04:20 - instructions but anyway you want to look
04:22 - for something like this and we're using
04:24 - your
04:25 - so normally but you know you
04:28 - most people have npm install it if
04:30 - they're using node but optionally you
04:33 - can use yarn they do the same thing so
04:36 - I'm gonna just copy and paste this so
04:39 - we're gonna do yarn add to add the
04:41 - package and this is a new package then
04:44 - the old name was just send grid so of
04:48 - wool will remove the the old package
04:54 - let's paste that in and you see it's
05:00 - going through and it's installing
05:01 - everything okay we get warnings warnings
05:04 - are okay so if you get errors then it
05:09 - didn't work but warnings are are fine
05:13 - okay so we had success so you can notice
05:21 - it actually installs a bunch of
05:23 - different things that are kind of
05:24 - separated out we don't really need to
05:27 - worry about that but it's kind of
05:30 - interesting to know they do make note of
05:32 - it in the documentation at some point I
05:35 - don't remember if it's in here or on
05:37 - github but we'll go over we don't need
05:41 - this anymore and let me show you what
05:49 - happened in our just sit over here so
05:54 - and our pack is JSON we now have our
06:00 - send read package with the version
06:04 - number I so here is our old package
06:08 - here's our new one and we'll go ahead
06:14 - and remove this right now I think it's I
06:19 - think it's yarn remove maybe I'll double
06:24 - check just to be sure I'm pretty sure
06:28 - it's you know
06:35 - yeah okay so we're gonna go yarn remove
06:41 - SendGrid
06:58 - okay and now look we can double check
07:01 - make sure it was removed yep and it's
07:03 - not here it was there and now it's gone
07:05 - okay so now we've we've removed the old
07:08 - version of SendGrid and now we have the
07:12 - new the new one so let's see we'll check
07:16 - out our survey j/s file and see what we
07:18 - need to change now
07:21 - so obviously we're going to need to
07:25 - change let's see probably where we're
07:32 - requiring and how we're requiring this
07:34 - stuff I would imagine that that changed
07:36 - so all the I'm gonna have the
07:38 - documentation up on my other screen and
07:46 - I'll bring it over if I think you know
07:50 - maybe there's something that would be
07:53 - better to see but a lot of this stuff it
07:58 - would probably be hard to read the
07:59 - documentation anyway I'd have to make it
08:01 - really big let's
08:12 - okay yeah so there is gonna be a little
08:14 - bit of a difference so let's go with ya
08:20 - this is gonna be really different now
08:23 - that I look at it okay so let's just
08:25 - let's get right into it also if you're
08:28 - asking questions right now on the live
08:30 - chat I'm glancing at it occasionally but
08:32 - after this 25-minute session so my timer
08:36 - here I'll go back and take five minutes
08:38 - and answer some questions and then at
08:41 - the end of the stream I'll answer all
08:43 - the questions so I don't I don't mean to
08:48 - give the impression that I'm annoying
08:50 - the live chat I just have it kind of
08:53 - partitioned out that I switch back and
08:55 - forth so I guess if you wanted to follow
09:00 - along right now I'm just on that
09:01 - SendGrid NPM page and I'm just checking
09:07 - out just the very basic use case to you
09:12 - know
09:12 - import this and then we'll try to adapt
09:15 - what we have to match this new this new
09:20 - way of doing things it's it's really
09:22 - different I think we'll have to change
09:24 - pretty much everything from what we did
09:26 - before and I don't know that I mentioned
09:29 - this before but the the reason I wanted
09:31 - to do this and I switched back from
09:33 - project 3 here not a project to is that
09:36 - I definitely want people who watch who
09:39 - are watching this project to know that
09:42 - there's a new way of doing it since we
09:44 - already did a stream with the old way I
09:49 - kind of felt like I I really should show
09:53 - the newer way because I know there's
09:56 - some people that follow along with these
09:57 - projects and they base some of their
09:59 - projects on that so I almost felt an
10:02 - obligation to to show the update since
10:05 - it changed so much
10:08 - alright so let's bring in oops switch to
10:14 - my code here let's bring this in so you
10:20 - know we're changing the names of our
10:21 - constants so a lots going to have to
10:24 - change
10:25 - and when we bring in our API key it's
10:31 - also different
10:40 - so I actually not sure that we even want
10:43 - to do it up here probably down
10:54 - you know what maybe I'll do it right
10:56 - here after this is kind of messing up my
11:00 - organization now but until I think of a
11:05 - different place to put this here's what
11:07 - I'm gonna do
11:08 - you'll see in a second one I'm talking
11:10 - about so before we actually set the API
11:13 - key here when we were you know making
11:15 - this this constant anyway the rainout
11:17 - like we don't have to that's not the way
11:20 - it's done anymore so okay cool that's
11:26 - the the same name so we can just delete
11:31 - this now let's scroll down to where
11:38 - we're actually using this so the first
11:40 - place that we're using anything with
11:44 - SendGrid
11:44 - is for that suggest a story form so of
11:50 - the two forms that we have this one is
11:52 - by far the simpler of the two so this
11:57 - will be a good place to start so you can
12:00 - see right now what we're doing is you
12:07 - know we're using this helper dot email
12:09 - and helper dot you know other things to
12:13 - kind of build up all the elements that
12:14 - we need and then we're combining them
12:19 - all here in this mail constant and at
12:28 - some point we're finally you know
12:30 - passing this so there's a request let's
12:35 - see where we actually end up there we go
12:37 - finally after we combine all of these we
12:42 - go SJP I and then you know we pass in
12:46 - the request so it's it's different it's
12:49 - a lot different now so now I'm gonna
12:52 - copy and paste over what it's going to
12:56 - look like I I think this way is actually
13:01 - it's pretty simple
13:06 - so we just have one constant now and
13:10 - we're calling it message and then it's
13:14 - an object and then we have all the you
13:17 - know everything that we need right here
13:20 - that seems a lot more readable to me so
13:22 - I think that's a good change and then
13:25 - when we're ready to send that message we
13:33 - used two s gmail dot send and we pass in
13:36 - that message so really really easy now
13:44 - if you notice right there there's no
13:46 - like error coming through so I need to
13:49 - look at the documentation you know as we
13:51 - go go forward to see like shouldn't we
13:54 - have some error handling so but like I
13:57 - said the example that I was using right
14:00 - now was just for like basic how to get
14:05 - it working so there there is a lot more
14:09 - in terms of use cases and the
14:14 - documentation so so this is what I'll be
14:18 - looking at so there's a lot of use cases
14:21 - here the URL is more complicated but you
14:25 - know basically the nodejs SendGrid
14:28 - that's linked in the description package
14:30 - is mail use cases MD that's that's how
14:33 - you get to it if you wanted to follow
14:35 - along so I'm hoping at some point let's
14:40 - go to the kitchen sink example here that
14:42 - way we'll get everything all at once
14:44 - so let's go through this just so that
14:52 - you and I both have kind of an idea of
14:55 - what's possible see I haven't even gone
15:00 - through this yet I didn't get this far
15:01 - in the documentation yet all right so
15:03 - we're good there we're doing all this
15:04 - you know we have we can do to see this
15:08 - is good these are things I definitely
15:10 - wanted to do
15:26 - this is interesting I've never used
15:29 - anything with the SendGrid templates
15:34 - unless sure if I want to look into this
15:36 - right now for this stream but I'm
15:38 - interested in that mmm interesting we
15:47 - can we can add attachments as well we're
15:53 - gonna have to think about this I didn't
15:54 - realize that this was possible you know
15:57 - we already have not for this form but
16:00 - for the next form that we're gonna work
16:01 - on you we are getting you know we're
16:05 - getting files we're sending them but we
16:07 - weren't sending them in the email now it
16:09 - will be possible to send these as an
16:12 - attachment I don't know
16:17 - I'm asked to think about that that might
16:19 - not be a bad thing a bad thing to do it
16:24 - would be almost like another backup
16:27 - you know already saving them and we're
16:32 - sending them to project management
16:33 - system but I mean the email might be
16:36 - nice as well
16:48 - okay I see okay I like this I like that
16:55 - we can use then this is definitely more
17:00 - in line with what we're doing elsewhere
17:03 - throughout in survey j/s but really
17:05 - throughout you know you're using then
17:08 - we're using a lot of arrow functions so
17:09 - I like that but this is good this is
17:12 - what I was hoping that would be in the
17:14 - the kitchen sink example so let's put
17:17 - that in now okay so you have this
17:40 - okay
17:42 - so let's put in for now let's just copy
17:47 - and paste all these values probably will
17:49 - want to change some of these values but
17:51 - I want something that I can you know
17:54 - test out right now so we're gonna copy
17:57 - and paste these and I'm just gonna have
18:04 - it be sent just to myself right now that
18:11 - is gonna change but just I can't believe
18:15 - I just copy and paste at the exact same
18:17 - email address so that's how it is that
18:22 - I'm trying to talk and do this at the
18:26 - same time sometimes I make silly
18:28 - mistakes okay so now we have text
18:35 - where's our text email body actually our
18:43 - email body is HTML so let's put it in
18:46 - the HTML and that is not a string that
18:52 - is a variable okay I'm interested to see
18:57 - if text is necessary I don't think it's
19:03 - a bad idea to have a text version of the
19:05 - email let's check out I wonder if it
19:15 - says anywhere which fields are required
19:29 - interesting
19:34 - yeah this template looks this looks
19:40 - interesting
19:54 - all right you know it for now I I think
19:58 - I'm just gonna put in a message let's
20:01 - see
20:09 - see
20:24 - okay and that'll be alright on the off
20:28 - chance that someone has an email client
20:30 - that doesn't allow HTML which I've
20:35 - actually seen it on campus some people
20:39 - on campus have their email clients set
20:41 - by default to not show any HTML and only
20:44 - show the plain text so in case that
20:46 - happens though at least get a nice
20:47 - message they won't get all the same data
20:50 - but they'll get this message and that
20:53 - should be enough
20:56 - just to reassure because this would go
20:59 - to the user and we'll also have one that
21:02 - goes to our project manager or someone
21:07 - else in my department I'll probably have
21:10 - myself bcc'd on everything as well at
21:14 - least at first to make sure things are
21:15 - going through properly okay so for now I
21:26 - wonder I do want to check to see if this
21:30 - is necessary now or if if we include
21:35 - HTML then it's just automatic but let's
21:40 - let's go back to that example that have
21:41 - everything
21:53 - yeah I don't see an equivalent feeling
21:57 - so let's just give it a shot let's get
22:03 - rid of all of this
22:05 - let's make sure yeah we want to keep
22:08 - that bracket but everything else we can
22:10 - get rid of and we're gonna save that and
22:19 - what do I have I have this open
22:24 - somewhere I don't know where now
22:33 - oh well I'll just open it again so we
22:39 - have this the the localhost port 9000 is
22:45 - the one where the forms actually work so
22:48 - if you're running this locally 3,000
22:52 - works fine for most things but not for
22:55 - the forms 9000 is what you want for the
22:58 - forms I've already went in and I've I've
23:00 - set my environment variables for sending
23:04 - emails to true by default everything is
23:07 - false so that that way if you if you're
23:10 - kind of playing around with this on your
23:13 - own on your local machine I don't get
23:14 - spammed with emails but this should send
23:19 - the email so you suggest the story
23:35 - that's interesting okay that's why that
23:40 - makes sense
23:40 - I hit enter expecting it to submit but I
23:43 - was in a multi line input so it's good
23:49 - that it didn't submit know what happened
23:52 - all right let's see what the error is
23:54 - let's see if it comes up here oops it
24:06 - looks like I forgot a closing friend
24:12 - well you guys say if it's a singular for
24:15 - parenthesis is it a paren I've heard
24:19 - that before but not very often so I'm
24:23 - not a hundred percent sure on that I
24:27 - should ask my wife she's an English
24:29 - professor so she should know things like
24:32 - that and that was up at the top there we
24:37 - go it was funny when I when I finished
24:40 - this the one this earlier I looked at
24:42 - the end of it and I thought that looks
24:44 - really weird and then I just kept
24:45 - scrolling down I didn't take the time to
24:48 - think about it it's somewhere in my
24:54 - brain it registered that that was wrong
24:56 - I suppose okay now let's give it a shot
25:01 - awesome okay so it says it was
25:07 - successful and I just got a notification
25:12 - on my phone and the email says thank you
25:20 - for your submission actually I want to
25:23 - see this if if this is visible I've
25:26 - never tried to show this before on the
25:29 - screen no it's not it's way too small
25:35 - but anyway I got the email it came
25:37 - through so great so that works now now
25:45 - what we need to do is let's put in some
25:50 - extra options so this is great right now
25:54 - but this is not what we want you know
25:55 - ideally so let's go through and let's do
25:59 - what what we should do and so what I
26:04 - mean by that is we need to actually send
26:06 - two different emails and we can't just
26:09 - have hard-coded email addresses in here
26:11 - we need to take the user email we need
26:13 - to put a proper from email and probably
26:19 - a from name I'm not that worried about
26:22 - it for the email that's gonna go to
26:25 - someone in my department but for the
26:27 - email that goes to the user I want it to
26:29 - look you know as professional as
26:31 - possible right emails that look kind of
26:33 - shady might not get open it might get
26:36 - reported as hey I think somebody's like
26:38 - trying to fish you know or something
26:41 - like that
26:42 - so let's we actually did have that
26:46 - happen before not it wasn't one of my
26:49 - emails but someone else on the
26:50 - department was sending out emails and
26:52 - someone from IT said like hey did you
26:55 - send this because it looks like you know
26:58 - it looks kind of shady so now I'm
27:03 - careful to make sure that my emails look
27:05 - legit all right so let's add we want to
27:13 - add a BCC field so let's do that now
27:17 - I'm gonna BCC me but I don't want my my
27:23 - personal email let's do my work email
27:30 - okay so that's good and we want to do
27:36 - let's take a look at that documentation
27:40 - again great so here's my check my time
27:50 - okay I'm almost up so I'm gonna ask a
27:52 - question and then see what would you all
27:54 - think it's possible to send two
27:56 - completely different emails or I could
27:59 - just send one email and send it to more
28:01 - than one person or BCC more than one
28:04 - person or you know anything so do you
28:07 - think it's better to send two completely
28:11 - different emails or just have the person
28:13 - in my department get the email that the
28:18 - the user would get and just be copied on
28:20 - it or you know blind copied on it which
28:24 - would be the simpler option at this
28:27 - point I at this point there's no reason
28:29 - to show different data to both of those
28:32 - people yeah so anyway let me know what
28:38 - you think that I was thinking I'd like
28:41 - to send two different emails but now
28:42 - that I think about it maybe the simpler
28:45 - approach is better later on I can always
28:48 - switch it up if I find that I do need to
28:51 - send different data so let's see okay
28:58 - cool I already got some answers and it
29:00 - looks like we're there's at least right
29:04 - now some agreement on sending you know
29:07 - just copying on one email yeah after I
29:13 - kind of said it out loud the answer
29:15 - became somewhat obvious to me earlier
29:17 - when I was thinking about it for some
29:20 - reason I thought that I would need two
29:22 - different emails all right let me set my
29:25 - five-minute timer and I'm gonna scroll
29:28 - up a bit and the live chat and see what
29:30 - what questions you all have no bears no
29:35 - beer says what's up how you doing oh not
29:39 - bad not bad same same stuff same
29:42 - lack of motivation today but I did
29:45 - manage on my lunch break to get a lot of
29:48 - stuff done on my my Redux project so I'm
29:53 - excited about that because I haven't
29:54 - worked on it since Saturday and I was
29:56 - afraid like I'm gonna forget what I was
29:59 - doing and but I didn't I mean it took me
30:03 - a while to get my mind back into things
30:05 - but I was able to work really quickly
30:09 - and get some tasks out of the way faster
30:11 - than I even thought that I would be able
30:12 - to so that was cool hey everybody see
30:21 - like a lot of people saying hi spar
30:26 - wheel says can I ask an off topic
30:28 - question the Q&A yeah definitely yeah
30:32 - don't worry about it questions are good
30:34 - you know any any kind of questions are
30:36 - good I mean coding related questions
30:39 - obviously you know or are allowed but
30:42 - even other off-topic questions
30:44 - I mean if for some reason anybody would
30:45 - ever ask a question that I did not want
30:48 - to answer I would just say that so
30:50 - that's never happened yet but I mean
30:55 - maybe it could happen so the only
30:59 - questions I could think of not wanting
31:01 - to answer would be things that I thought
31:02 - were like not not like pg-rated stuff
31:07 - right because we do have like kids watch
31:10 - this you know we've had how young did we
31:13 - have I think somebody was 8 years old
31:16 - watching this at some point we've
31:18 - definitely had somebody who's 11 but so
31:20 - anyway those kind of questions would be
31:22 - the only thing that I could think of
31:23 - that I wouldn't answer if you ask me
31:27 - like you know what's the password in my
31:29 - alarm system on my house I'll probably
31:31 - want to answer that but anyway that's Oh
31:37 - Patrick Patrick caught the closing
31:42 - perennially used parens so that answers
31:45 - my question so it is paren and thanks
31:48 - for catching that Patrick it took me
31:49 - quite a while to realize my mistake hey
31:54 - Sebastian's back
32:09 - I wrote one said that Android Oreo
32:11 - goodness did you notice I'm running Oreo
32:14 - on my phone so yeah I have the pixel XL
32:20 - and I'm on Google Phi so I got the Oreo
32:24 - update like immediately so cool so far I
32:30 - like it it's not really that different
32:32 - but the differences are improvements in
32:36 - my opinion so so far so good on the
32:41 - Android Oreo update okay so John Hanson
32:50 - says the singular form is parentheses so
32:55 - it ends with sis but the plural is
32:57 - parentheses s es okay that's cool I'm
33:06 - wondering where that where that endings
33:08 - from where does the word prevent
33:11 - parentheses come from is that Latin in
33:13 - origin or is that Greek in origin if
33:15 - it's Latin I could probably understand a
33:19 - little bit more why that's the singular
33:22 - and plural I'm not really up as much on
33:24 - my my agent Greek as I am on the Latin
33:31 - okay so Kade says that I should copy on
33:37 - a normal email so just do the CC rohan
33:40 - says BCC yeah oh
33:50 - you'll see what I'll go with I probably
33:52 - should ask I needed to check to see
33:55 - actually on I gotta check the old code
33:58 - for this and see who I'm sending this to
34:00 - now because I I think I know who it's
34:03 - being sent to but I need to double check
34:05 - so I'll make sure I do that I know where
34:10 - the the other forum is going for sure
34:24 - John Hanson says is this server sent
34:27 - email or will it go through an
34:28 - authenticated outbound email SMTP it's
34:33 - it's all being routed so it's not being
34:35 - sent straight from the server it's being
34:37 - routed to send grid so I don't I don't
34:41 - really know what I have set up with and
34:43 - good to be honest with you I'm not I
34:45 - don't mess with the email that much to
34:48 - even know what what different all I know
34:54 - is that sangra does a good job of
34:56 - getting the emails where they need to go
34:57 - right now so I'm sticking with that
35:11 - let's see root Reuven I think that's how
35:16 - you'd say that so Reuben says just
35:20 - joined what's up working on updating the
35:23 - how we're sending emails through
35:25 - SendGrid so the send grid node package
35:28 - got some big updates and breaking
35:30 - changes and we're going to try to send
35:34 - well we've just successfully switched
35:37 - over to it for one of our forms and sent
35:39 - an email so now we're just going to try
35:41 - to add some extra things on some extra
35:44 - options here
35:58 - okay all right cool so I actually did
36:00 - get to the bottom of the live chat and
36:02 - this well I went over the five minutes a
36:04 - bit but not that much over so I'm gonna
36:05 - start up another 25-minute session the
36:08 - way things are going now I think we'll
36:10 - probably just do one more 25-minute
36:12 - session because I mean we're gonna get
36:15 - at least this forum we'll probably get
36:18 - to the point where it's it's pretty much
36:20 - finished and then the other forum won't
36:22 - be you know won't really be different
36:26 - I'll just copy and paste from this first
36:28 - forum and it should be about the same I
36:32 - don't think I'm gonna mess with sending
36:35 - the files today okay
36:46 - so let's
36:48 - hmm okay for now I'm just gonna BCC my
36:55 - work email because I don't I don't know
36:58 - for sure who's supposed to be getting
36:59 - these emails I'll have to look that up
37:01 - and the current version of this Resource
37:06 - Center also I don't want to put their
37:09 - emails right now I guess I could make
37:11 - them an environment variable so I'll
37:13 - probably end up doing that but I don't
37:15 - want to I don't want to look them up
37:17 - during the stream because that would be
37:19 - boring
37:21 - you always see this while I was on my
37:23 - other screen looking it up so basically
37:26 - let's just assume that I'm going to add
37:28 - some extra emails on here now when I do
37:30 - that I think I need to make them an
37:32 - array yeah so what I need to do assuming
37:36 - I'm gonna be CC and not CC I'll just
37:38 - make an array like that so just in case
37:41 - you're gonna do something similar that's
37:44 - how it needs to be done the reply to
37:54 - let's see
37:59 - off to think about based on who that
38:03 - emails going to off to think about the
38:05 - reply to as well from
38:19 - I thought somewhere that I had seen
38:23 - I guess she can't do that anyway
38:28 - basically like to add something else for
38:30 - the from not just the email
38:39 - okay not bad we might just move on to
38:45 - the other form because I think this is
38:48 - all we need for this one like I said
38:49 - this one's really basic form I do want
38:51 - to check quickly what that email look
38:55 - like in my browser just to make sure it
39:01 - looked all right
39:14 - okay it's not bad it's really really
39:17 - basic so I'll show you it's it's just
39:22 - super basic but that's pretty much what
39:28 - users are getting now it's it's it looks
39:32 - a little bit better than this but it's
39:35 - still it's pretty basic okay I'm okay
39:40 - with that for now
39:41 - like I said later on I think I want to
39:44 - look into the templating thing and see I
39:46 - think it would be a lot easier to set up
39:49 - a template through SendGrid
39:51 - than to try to just piece together HTML
39:57 - and here kind of like what I'm doing now
39:59 - template literals definitely make it a
40:02 - lot easier but it would still probably
40:08 - be better
40:09 - oh that's why I wondered why I didn't
40:11 - get two lines there I forgot to close
40:13 - that tag so anyway template literals
40:16 - make it a lot easier but I think it
40:17 - would still be nicer to not clutter up
40:19 - this already very cluttered server j/s
40:23 - file with a giant amount of HTML okay
40:32 - cool so let's let's grab let's see let's
40:38 - check out our other forum for now see
40:41 - what we have and then see if we could
40:43 - just grab most of this and reuse it so
40:46 - we do have a lot more going on here so
40:48 - we're doing some checking right we have
40:50 - to handle files so all this stuff is for
40:56 - our files and but then at some point we
41:03 - get to the emails that's down here okay
41:08 - so it looks like that's the same this is
41:11 - different
41:14 - our field string should include at some
41:20 - point yeah so it does include the the
41:24 - file names doesn't it no no that's just
41:28 - the the field still
41:38 - okay the filenames will be included
41:41 - already too because because the way we
41:43 - built the the form so okay so it looks
41:52 - like I can basically copy and paste
41:53 - everything we did from up here all we
41:55 - need to do is change this and this and
42:00 - it should be fine yeah so let's do that
42:11 - so far this is easier than than I
42:16 - anticipated
42:17 - which is awesome I'm not sure that I oh
42:31 - no I'm good with this I thought maybe
42:33 - this was left over
42:48 - I mean double-check that
42:56 - okay
43:07 - No
43:09 - I'm gonna take all that and I'm gonna
43:14 - copy it up here and we'll just take this
43:25 - subject
43:45 - choose that and then we need field
43:48 - string
43:53 - and I'll probably want to do something
43:57 - like we had done up here so that we're
43:59 - not just putting in the field string
44:01 - we'll have some text at the top so let's
44:05 - get rid of its get rid of all this
44:18 - and
44:22 - let's bring in here we go let's bring
44:27 - this in
44:47 - Qwest and now we can change this back to
44:52 - email body
44:58 - okay
45:01 - and
45:07 - no I just let me check I think I have my
45:11 - environment variables open on my other
45:13 - screen and okay I don't I thought I had
45:21 - the project managers email saved already
45:25 - but I don't but I think that will end up
45:28 - being the email that's here and maybe
45:32 - I'll I'll probably double-check as well
45:35 - to see what the from email is currently
45:39 - and try to match that okay not bad well
45:49 - let's test this out make sure we didn't
45:51 - mess anything up so right off the bat no
45:56 - errors in the console so that's good and
46:00 - let's go to our service request form and
46:05 - I can't remember what fields we ended up
46:10 - making required
46:19 - actually before I test this we may as
46:23 - well try to use the user email for the
46:26 - two so let's grab it should be we've
46:32 - made in objects of the fields right okay
46:40 - so we have this constant fields which is
46:42 - an object and then we add the fields and
46:48 - the keys are the names of the field so
46:50 - I'm pretty sure email is just the the
46:54 - name of that field so we should be able
46:56 - to go fields dot email and that'll be
47:00 - the the users email all right so let's
47:08 - test that out and it's gonna end up
47:13 - being the same email okay and I think
47:23 - yeah I think that was required as well
47:30 - okay great
47:32 - do you notice I don't know if you saw
47:33 - that there's a slight flash at first
47:36 - when this happens I think what's
47:38 - happening is we have two different
47:41 - modal's
47:41 - so the first modal that pops up says
47:45 - like sending your process a or something
47:47 - like that it's basically just you know
47:49 - loader then then it comes up with done
47:55 - but there's a slight flash when it when
47:57 - it happens really fast so I think what
47:59 - I'll probably end up doing is make it so
48:04 - that two different modal's don't appear
48:06 - but that the text inside the modal
48:09 - changes that way that'll just be one
48:13 - modal we shouldn't get the flash or at
48:15 - least it shouldn't be
48:16 - as big of a flash because instead of the
48:20 - entire modal changing it will just be
48:23 - the text inside
48:31 - okay so let me check and check my email
48:54 - okay just got the email great okay so it
49:02 - came through
49:09 - that's gonna need cleaned up a bit so
49:12 - let me show you what it looks like this
49:14 - one definitely needs cleaned up more so
49:17 - I don't really want to use her seeing
49:18 - all this so I think it would be better
49:21 - if and now I just realized that why are
49:26 - they
49:40 - I thought that I had put in oh you know
49:49 - what I had I had put in the right ones
49:52 - let me see okay I just didn't build yet
50:00 - so anyway alright so that should be
50:05 - better but it's still gonna be I don't
50:07 - want them to see all these falses so
50:09 - we'll have to make it so that if it is
50:12 - false it doesn't get sent with the email
50:15 - because that's that's not really great
50:19 - to see also I don't like the order of
50:24 - these I think it would be better if it
50:26 - was in a different order so I need to
50:33 - clean that up a little bit again though
50:36 - I'd like to check out what can be done
50:38 - with templates from but I'm probably
50:44 - it's somewhere in the SendGrid dashboard
50:46 - that I'll be creating the templates but
50:52 - the cool thing is it did grab the users
50:55 - email which in this case was me and it
50:58 - sent it to the correct email so that's
50:59 - what we wanted so I want to take that
51:03 - sip what we did there and I mean not
51:07 - really that much I guess I didn't really
51:08 - have to copy copy it but we're gonna put
51:12 - that up here oops
51:20 - I'm gonna save that and I mean actually
51:29 - I don't know that there's that much more
51:35 - that really needs done you know other
51:37 - than the few things that I said we would
51:39 - maybe do let me check the timer and see
51:41 - how much time we have left all right ten
51:44 - minutes
51:47 - [Music]
51:53 - let's see
52:13 - sorry oh she's checking the live chat
52:15 - quickly but yeah I kind of think I I'm
52:22 - not gonna try to add a new feature you
52:25 - know within ten minutes I don't think I
52:27 - can the next thing that I would probably
52:29 - want to do is check out those templates
52:32 - and see if that would be an easy
52:34 - solution to clean this up a little bit
52:36 - make it look nicer but there's no way
52:40 - that I can get that done in ten minutes
52:42 - so I think what we'll end up doing is
52:45 - I'm gonna go now take the rest of this
52:48 - time to go over the pool request we've
52:52 - got so you know anytime any of you
52:54 - submit a pull request I definitely want
52:56 - to give you credit for it and bring
52:58 - everybody up to date on you know any
53:00 - changes in the project so I'm gonna do
53:02 - that and then we'll do our question
53:06 - answer to finish out so if you have
53:08 - questions now please put them in the
53:11 - live chat and as I said earlier don't
53:15 - you know know almost no question is
53:18 - really off topic here so don't worry
53:22 - about you know whether or not your
53:25 - question is relevant
53:26 - any questions are fine with me let's see
53:32 - you bring over
53:47 - all right so we did just get a pull
53:50 - request so I am going to open that up if
53:55 - then I'm also going to show you this
53:58 - lady's pull request that I just merged
54:09 - okay and actually I don't think I ever
54:11 - talked about this one to the last two I
54:14 - don't think I talked about all right so
54:18 - these two are related so so we've had so
54:26 - cuckoo Kieran
54:28 - it's that has added I mean I was reading
54:37 - this to double check make sure I get it
54:38 - right
54:40 - okay so added the link so we had a
54:45 - readme for people who want to contribute
54:51 - to the project but they're really new
54:52 - they don't understand get so Sebastian
54:54 - had opened an issue and suggested that
54:58 - we put in information about how to use
55:00 - git and github so we had some
55:05 - information in there but now we have a
55:08 - lot so with these two pull requests they
55:10 - have a lot of info so I added some
55:13 - suggestions Sebastian added some
55:15 - suggestions so between the three of us
55:20 - we've got quite a few resources so I can
55:23 - show you now we have a lot of good
55:27 - resources for beginners on you know how
55:32 - to fork the project and just general get
55:36 - help so I know I have done this course
55:41 - that was good and I did this course on
55:45 - Udacity as well so I personally can
55:47 - recommend those two courses the Udacity
55:50 - course was I found was really thorough
55:52 - and it had some other beneficial things
55:54 - like teaching you how to get different
55:58 - colors and you're in your command line
56:00 - which not necessary but kind of cool so
56:05 - anyway so thanks for that and if there's
56:07 - anybody that's kind of new to get you
56:11 - know check that out and you know if you
56:15 - go through some of these you definitely
56:17 - you know what's going on when it comes
56:20 - to get and
56:21 - and this other pull request we just got
56:27 - right before I started this dream so I
56:31 - wanted to go over this and talk about
56:33 - this because I think there's a really
56:35 - good observation about the UI and a good
56:38 - pool request but I did want to ask you
56:40 - out what you thought so I really like
56:43 - the idea but I think I want to implement
56:46 - it in a slightly different way so let me
56:50 - show you what what I'm talking about
56:53 - I'll go to this one so on the logos so
56:58 - right now there's no indication of where
57:02 - where we're at I guess I should have
57:04 - went to this one so that we could
57:06 - actually see the logos so anyway there's
57:12 - no indication of which one you're you're
57:14 - on currently and you know Sebastian saw
57:20 - this and said yeah we definitely need
57:22 - that and I completely agree so Sebastian
57:25 - I think it just changed the font weight
57:27 - of it which definitely works and I'll
57:30 - I'll probably just pull that in and use
57:33 - that but at some point I think what I'd
57:36 - like to do is make these change how
57:39 - these are right now and make them tabs
57:44 - like material design tabs I don't know
57:48 - why I didn't do that right off the bat
57:50 - but I think the way this is you know
57:54 - currently I think it really makes sense
57:59 - to be tabs you know we have it one
58:03 - across the top here and let me show you
58:06 - what I mean by tabs I'm gonna go on
58:12 - materialized normally I go right to the
58:15 - documentation for material design
58:19 - Google's documentation but this way I
58:23 - think will be a little bit more
58:24 - interactive we can see with the with the
58:26 - tabs are here JavaScript
58:29 - yeah tabs okay so you can see like the
58:33 - tabs
58:34 - we'll go across the top and basically
58:37 - the indicator would be this little
58:40 - underlined let me see if they have any
58:43 - other example so the indicator would be
58:46 - a little underlined and then it would
58:47 - you know flip around you know based on
58:52 - that so I'm thinking that would be the
59:00 - best way to go now we aren't we aren't
59:02 - using materialized for the tabs right
59:04 - we're using material UI so I probably
59:06 - should check the terior UI and see how
59:09 - how its implemented there okay so here
59:19 - we go same same thing you click the tag
59:22 - or the tab and you get the underline so
59:28 - that's what I'm thinking that will end
59:31 - up will end up doing that I'm not I'm
59:35 - not really worried about it but since
59:36 - we're going with the material design
59:37 - thing I think that would be the more
59:40 - consistent way to handle that I'm trying
59:42 - to find it again I keep flipping around
59:45 - everywhere so I think that would be a
59:46 - more consistent way to handle that to
59:49 - use the tabs and then we would still
59:50 - though once it got small go to something
59:55 - like this so the the only thing that I'm
60:02 - you know kind of slightly not sure about
60:05 - is I vaguely remember something about
60:09 - the tabs like you shouldn't have a
60:11 - million tabs with material design so
60:14 - this is quite a lot of tabs so I don't
60:18 - know so that might be I'm not I'm not
60:21 - worried about going against material
60:23 - design specs if we need to for this use
60:25 - case and I think it would be fine I
60:30 - think it'd be okay to drop drop down to
60:33 - this like we have here which oh man I
60:36 - never fixed that
60:43 - maybe did I fix it I did I just okay so
60:49 - this this version is a bit out of date
60:51 - so I did fix it I thought I fixed it
60:54 - okay so anyway that's the that's the
60:57 - pool request so thank you Sebastian
61:03 - like I said I'll probably pull that in
61:05 - because I think it's important to have
61:07 - but longer-term I'm thinking that maybe
61:11 - I would want to change that to tabs so I
61:15 - don't know if anybody really wants to
61:17 - try that out you know feel free that
61:20 - would be awesome I don't know how soon
61:22 - I'll get to it I don't think that's
61:23 - something that I really need before we
61:25 - launch so I'd really rather work on
61:28 - project three as much as I possibly can
61:31 - because then I have to switch projects
61:33 - again in October I just kind of want to
61:37 - get this one done and launch it and then
61:40 - I can always come back and change things
61:43 - when I get a chance later on alright so
61:47 - that's that's the end of that
61:49 - FOMA Torres session so it's good timing
61:51 - and now I will go back to the live chat
61:57 - and I'm gonna answer all the questions
62:05 - in the live chat unless for some reason
62:07 - we get lots and lots of questions but
62:10 - should be able to get to everything it
62:12 - doesn't look to look like there's too
62:13 - many questions right now so if you if
62:19 - you can't stick around for the
62:20 - question/answer session then thanks for
62:22 - watching and I'll be back tomorrow so
62:25 - hopefully you can come back and catch
62:28 - the live stream again but if you have a
62:31 - few extra minutes and can stick around
62:32 - even if you don't have a question I'd
62:34 - really appreciate if you could help
62:35 - answer questions in the live chat your
62:38 - expertise is definitely a big benefit to
62:45 - everybody I think that that watches the
62:47 - stream and to me as well so let me find
62:52 - where
62:53 - stuff
63:01 - okay so here's a good comment
63:04 - so Rohan is talking about emails and
63:07 - said I tried setting up my own email as
63:10 - experiment and says it looks so simple
63:15 - in theory but with modern add-ons you
63:17 - will miss something it's better to just
63:19 - use something like SendGrid
63:21 - i mean that's basically what i the
63:24 - conclusion that I came to as well and
63:26 - why I was using SendGrid
63:29 - initially I had so there were several
63:37 - reasons that went into my choice for
63:39 - SendGrid but that was one of the reasons
63:40 - so I won't say that it's the only reason
63:42 - I used it but yeah but that's definitely
63:46 - you know if you really want to get into
63:49 - you know how to send emails and things
63:51 - is something you're interested in then I
63:52 - it would certainly be you know
63:54 - beneficial to you to try to do it you
63:56 - know from scratch on your own but if
63:59 - that's not something that really
64:00 - interests you then you know using
64:02 - something like SendGrid is the best way
64:04 - to go in my opinion John Hanson says so
64:12 - jonad asked earlier about what I was
64:15 - using so if it was a server if the email
64:19 - sent from the server is SMTP I think I
64:23 - got that right that I mix up that
64:24 - acronym yeah SMTP that's right so John
64:29 - says that's a prayer type answer to the
64:32 - email sending protocol I've used PHP
64:35 - mailer and even then I was shocked at
64:37 - how controlled email security and spam
64:40 - detection effects form submitted email
64:49 - yeah I I said I I haven't had any issues
64:55 - with SendGrid so far so we've been using
64:59 - it for a year over a year with this so I
65:08 - think in this particular case I'll be
65:11 - I'll be fine if the audience wasn't in
65:14 - turn
65:16 - so I mean right now I know the audience
65:18 - and I know what has words if the
65:20 - audience was external I might put a lot
65:22 - more thought into and do more testing
65:25 - for this John Hanson also said if
65:33 - SendGrid has some type of nicely
65:35 - formatted email template I'd go for that
65:37 - too yeah I think I mean I want to check
65:42 - it out and see see how easy it is to use
65:45 - and what it looks like but I mean right
65:47 - now my emails look pretty basic so it
65:52 - would be it would be nice if they look
65:55 - better Sebastian says tabs are a good
66:00 - idea so on this logo page but how will
66:04 - they work on small screens okay
66:10 - Sebastian I'm sorry I didn't so
66:13 - Sebastian says there's a bit more to the
66:15 - pool request and I just I didn't check
66:16 - it out so I'm sorry I didn't check this
66:19 - pull request like I said it came in
66:20 - right before the stream started so I'm
66:23 - sorry Sebastian so let's see point two
66:25 - oh okay so I mean obviously you all can
66:32 - read but in case somebody's just
66:34 - listening and can't see the and it's not
66:36 - actually looking at the video Sebastian
66:39 - also removed the the a tags that were
66:42 - inside the allies for all the the tabs
66:45 - that we have now basically what it was
66:49 - doing because they were a tags it was
66:51 - changing the hash in the URL and you're
66:57 - saying that's kind of annoying also
66:59 - unnecessary it's not like we're grabbing
67:01 - that and doing anything with it like
67:03 - automatically bringing you to that
67:05 - category so I agree that that was
67:08 - definitely a good move so now there's no
67:10 - a tags it's just a lies you know the
67:13 - Allies are the ones that have the the on
67:16 - click handler anyway so
67:23 - yeah so sorry I missed that again and
67:26 - thank you for that
67:37 - okay so che asks what are some other
67:40 - favorite design guides / languages
67:43 - besides material design trying to think
67:47 - what is so Microsoft has their design
67:52 - what do they call it
67:53 - I cannot remember what Microsoft's
67:58 - they're basically their latest design
68:00 - thing is what they use for like office
68:02 - 365 and I'm sorry I can't remember so
68:06 - like basically Microsoft has their
68:09 - version of design Sebastian says fluent
68:13 - or something that yeah I can't I can't
68:16 - remember
68:16 - and then Apple has their version so with
68:20 - iOS what do they call it now I can't
68:28 - remember I just I just heard this I was
68:32 - just watching a video earlier on react
68:34 - native and and they mentioned in the
68:36 - video what the name of the design is for
68:40 - iOS Wow I I'm doing a terrible job
68:44 - answering this question so although I
68:46 - can't remember the names of it okay cool
68:50 - so chases Microsoft is fluent so Apple
68:55 - Google and Microsoft all have their own
68:58 - distinct design languages fluent for
69:02 - Microsoft interior design for Google and
69:04 - something that I can't remember for for
69:07 -  now that's it okay human I knew
69:13 - it was interface something so Apple is
69:15 - called human interface Thank You Shea
69:19 - okay so in terms of like your big tech
69:23 - companies those are your design things
69:26 - but then there's also like I mean
69:28 - there's bootstrap right so bootstrap is
69:32 - I don't think it when you think of
69:35 - design if it would come up that like all
69:37 - bootstraps are design philosophy like in
69:39 - the same way that material design is but
69:41 - if you look at the web bootstrap is
69:43 - influenced design a lot right you can
69:46 - you can't always tell if someone use
69:49 - bootstrap because you can certainly cost
69:50 - a lot and it won't look like bootstrap
69:52 - but there are a lot of sites out there
69:54 - that are just basic bootstrap you go to
69:56 - the site and you don't even have to
69:58 - check you know they use bootstrap for
70:00 - that all right it's just used so so many
70:03 - places so just for the influence alone I
70:07 - would definitely say that it's it should
70:17 - be lumped in with some of the big design
70:21 - things now there was so there is design
70:24 - that it's falling out of favor now but I
70:27 - think it's called skeuomorphic design
70:29 - it's spelled really it's like sk ii you
70:32 - mor ph i see something like that so but
70:36 - it's um from what i understand at least
70:40 - and i'm not i don't think i'm at all an
70:43 - expert in design but from what I
70:45 - understand it was more like you take
70:51 - like real-world things and have them in
70:53 - the design so I guess an example would
70:58 - be I don't know if anybody remembers the
71:00 - old music player for windows that when
71:02 - amp and you can get different skins for
71:04 - when amp and some of them actually
71:06 - looked like a stereo like a real-life
71:08 - stereo with buttons you know and
71:10 - switches and stuff and you could press
71:12 - them like I said from my understanding
71:15 - of skeuomorphic design that would be an
71:18 - example that the interface actually
71:22 - looks like what the equivalent thing
71:27 - would look like in real life so someone
71:31 - please correct me if I'm getting that
71:32 - wrong but I think that's it so I also
71:38 - Sebastian mentions foundation so
71:40 - foundation is basically does the same
71:43 - thing as bootstrap and that's also
71:48 - that's also been influential so I don't
71:51 - know the statistics offhand I'm pretty
71:53 - sure that bootstrap is used on more
71:56 - sites right now but I hear a lot of good
71:59 - things about foundation I've looked
72:02 - through through their Docs
72:04 - remember if I ever used it on a project
72:06 - certainly not on any you know projects
72:09 - for clients or anything I may have used
72:11 - it just on some some side projects
72:13 - though okay so anyway Shay I hope I
72:19 - answered your question somewhat sorry I
72:23 - can't like I said I'm just not I'm not
72:28 - that well-versed and all the different
72:29 - you know design philosophies for for web
72:33 - design okay good so Shay says you're
72:38 - right about secure morphic Apple was
72:40 - also really into it for a while think
72:42 - the notes up yeah actually I was I was
72:44 - thinking that too the Notes app is a
72:47 - great example because it looks like a
72:50 - actual piece of paper like notepad paper
72:53 - so yeah I'm actually um I think ASCII
73:00 - morphic design is interesting and cool
73:02 - to look at sometimes but I'm I'm not a
73:05 - fan of it for actual like ease of use so
73:11 - I'm kind of glad that we got away from
73:13 - that I think for its I don't know my
73:17 - view on website design is like the sites
73:19 - that win like the design awards so what
73:23 - is it like the aaww I can't remember
73:26 - what it what the website is called but
73:30 - the sites that we design awards aren't
73:32 - always the most user-friendly sites
73:34 - sometimes you go to these sites and you
73:36 - have no idea how to navigate or what's
73:38 - going on but it looks really cool so I
73:42 - to me scheme Orphic design fits more
73:45 - into that category in terms of sometimes
73:49 - it can look really cool but it's not
73:51 - necessarily the most user-friendly right
73:55 - like to go back to the old winamp
73:56 - example I'm pretty sure like there were
73:58 - some elements in the UI of some of those
74:01 - skins that looks cool and it looked like
74:03 - a real stereo or something but it didn't
74:06 - actually do anything when you clicked it
74:08 - right so there there are elements like
74:11 - that now could you do it so that that
74:13 - didn't happen I'm sure you could
74:16 - but then would it look less realistic I
74:19 - don't know
74:19 - so now on the other side of things I
74:23 - think like material design is probably
74:25 - not gonna win any Design Awards like you
74:28 - you're I don't know that I've ever seen
74:30 - a sight when a design award and I'm
74:35 - talking about let me just bring the site
74:38 - up so that we all know we're talking
74:39 - about also let me know if there's
74:44 - anybody mine that I have the live set up
74:45 - on the screen because I mean I guess
74:47 - your name would be on on the video I
74:49 - know I already say your names but let me
74:53 - know I just brought it over to this
74:54 - screen because this screen has the
74:56 - camera on it right now
74:58 - and I just wanted to be kind of looking
75:04 - more at the camera instead of to the
75:06 - side so let me bring this up there we go
75:17 - yeah aw it's a few words so let me show
75:22 - I was trying to go to the home page we
75:26 - can see so this is what I'm talking
75:28 - about I'm talking about awards is mostly
75:30 - this is what I go to to see like you
75:34 - know whit's which sites so I'm sure
75:36 - there are other other awards but this
75:39 - tends to have like some really out there
75:42 - designs and things so like I said so I
75:45 - don't think you're ever gonna find just
75:47 - a straight-up by-the-book material
75:48 - design site on here but a material
75:51 - design site seems to be really user
75:54 - friendly so so my take on on design it's
76:02 - somewhat just depends on what you're
76:03 - going for with that that particular site
76:07 - and it would depend I mean if it's for a
76:09 - client you know if your clients a
76:11 - fashion designer I think you could get
76:15 - away with doing something that's really
76:16 - more like artistic even if it's less
76:19 - user friendly because the goal of a site
76:22 - like that might not be like hey we want
76:25 - a bunch of users here to be able to do
76:27 - something in particular the goal is we
76:30 - want to make an impression we make an
76:31 - impact right so it just it just depends
76:34 - you know on what you're going for and
76:39 - sometimes it's hard to keep that in mind
76:42 - I know like with project one which was
76:44 - the catechetical Institute website it
76:47 - was definitely a struggle there were
76:49 - some people involved in the project that
76:50 - I think they had in their minds that
76:52 - they really wanted this to make an
76:54 - impact they wanted it to be like
76:56 - visually stunning which is awesome but
77:01 - you know I just kept asking well like
77:04 - what is the point of this site what do
77:06 - you want people to do what do you know
77:08 - what do you want to get from this site
77:09 - so eventually I think we've reached a
77:12 - nice compromise where we had some
77:14 - elements that were there that were
77:15 - somewhat striking you know visually but
77:19 - we were able to work in a lot of very
77:21 - functional things so I you know that's I
77:27 - think it's kind of it's always a
77:28 - struggle depending on who you're working
77:31 - with as to where you go you know in
77:35 - terms of design let's see if some more
77:40 - things okay John Hanson says flat design
77:45 - started in 2012 not so long ago so yeah
77:48 - yeah there's definitely forgotten about
77:51 - that but there's the the flat design oh
77:55 - cool so Sebastian likes to chat on the
77:59 - screen awesome let me let me scroll up a
78:06 - bit because I think I skipped over some
78:08 - things
78:13 - okay so let me go said dead zombie says
78:17 - I just got into front-end development
78:19 - and I'm trying to learn a responsive
78:21 - design is bootstrap a good starting
78:23 - point or what's your opinion where
78:26 - should I start from let's see yeah I
78:35 - mean bootstrap is bootstrap is good I
78:41 - guess it it kind of depends too on what
78:45 - you what you want to do like if you I
78:49 - guess you're saying front end it's a
78:52 - friend development sponsor design yeah
78:54 - so I would say you can focus a lot on
79:00 - CSS and get really good at making these
79:04 - custom layouts and things or there's a
79:07 - lot of people to focus on javascript and
79:10 - they do a lot with javascript and don't
79:13 - worry so much about the customs layouts
79:15 - and they're happy to just use some
79:17 - pre-made system I've that's kind of
79:24 - where I'm at
79:25 - I do enjoy customizing things with CSS
79:28 - but I I rely you know I kind of fall
79:32 - back on either materialized or material
79:34 - UI you know so and I fall back on the
79:37 - material design guidelines so I guess
79:39 - it's kind of what you want if your goal
79:42 - is to be able to like make things from
79:44 - scratch in CSS and get really good at
79:46 - CSS then maybe you don't want to use
79:50 - bootstrap right away if your goal is
79:53 - just to start making websites and you
79:56 - know build up and get better with
79:57 - JavaScript and yeah definitely use
79:59 - bootstrap because it's going to take
80:01 - care of a lot of little detail things
80:03 - that could slow you up and would be
80:10 - unnecessary if you're not really trying
80:12 - to get your deep into CSS
80:19 - so I mean there's no I I don't think
80:21 - there's any problem at all with was
80:24 - starting out using bootstrap so even
80:26 - like in the free code camp courses or
80:30 - you know there exercises it starts out I
80:34 - mean you do some basic CSS but it really
80:35 - starts out with bootstrap and and allows
80:38 - you to use bootstrap for some of those
80:39 - projects so I think it's a good way to
80:41 - just move forward and get some
80:43 - confidence using sites and and then even
80:48 - beyond that you know if that works and
80:51 - you're making sites you're making good
80:53 - sites that people can use and get things
80:56 - done and your clients are happy with I
80:58 - don't really see a problem in using
81:00 - bootstrap and and never going on
81:03 - anything else if that's not really what
81:05 - you're into
81:13 - and then again as well you don't have to
81:16 - go with bootstrap certainly you could go
81:18 - with foundation you could go with
81:20 - materialized you could go with trying to
81:26 - things with some of the other one there
81:28 - are some that are lighter lighter
81:31 - frameworks so you don't want it's not
81:33 - like you have to go with a framework or
81:36 - nothing you can kind of go in between so
81:38 - there's some really lightweight
81:39 - frameworks that just will give you like
81:41 - you know some bare-bones things maybe
81:44 - like some column classes and and then
81:46 - you take care of a lot of the rest so
81:48 - you could compromise with that so that a
81:51 - lot of them or I don't know kind of
81:53 - mundane things are taken care of and
81:55 - then you add on top of that some of the
81:59 - more like creative visual elements so
82:02 - anyway so I mean I know you have a lot
82:05 - of choices sometimes it makes it harder
82:07 - to choose with more choices but you know
82:11 - at first like choose a system that you
82:13 - like how it looks because you want to
82:15 - like what you're building so if you
82:18 - really like how bootstrap looks then go
82:20 - with that otherwise you know find
82:24 - something that you really like Sebastian
82:30 - says I used to love when amp old times
82:34 - yeah for sure
82:37 - when F was awesome back in the day with
82:40 - all the custom skins you can have those
82:42 - those really cool
82:51 - gah
82:53 - Nitish says I I feel front end is hard
82:57 - but I enjoy developing back-end stuff
82:59 - what should I learn to become a decent
83:01 - web developer if you like back-end stuff
83:06 - and you want to learn some front-end so
83:09 - essentially like you're gonna be in full
83:11 - static right so if you like that the
83:16 - idea of being able to do everything and
83:19 - you like back-end now when you go into
83:24 - front-end I recommend like using things
83:28 - like a CSS framework like we just talked
83:31 - about bootstrap materialized foundation
83:34 - something like that or even something
83:37 - like react with material UI so that a
83:40 - lot of the HTML CSS stuff is taken care
83:44 - of for you you can you know learn some
83:48 - JavaScript so that you can make things
83:51 - work but you know realistically when
83:54 - you're dealing with something like react
83:55 - and if you use a component library
83:58 - you're not writing very much HTML at all
84:01 - or CSS instead you're thinking about the
84:06 - logic of it of state management and
84:08 - things like that which I think may be
84:13 - easier to go into because you know
84:16 - you're still using a programming
84:17 - language instead of like HTML or CSS so
84:21 - that might be a way to build out things
84:24 - on the front-end without having to worry
84:26 - too much about design and and
84:30 - essentially you you would be able to
84:32 - build complete complete apps you know
84:35 - front and back so if at some point it
84:39 - starts to get easier for you and you
84:40 - find you like it you can dig deeper in
84:43 - the front-end but until then you know I
84:46 - would I definitely recommend going with
84:50 - something that's that's built out as
84:53 - much as possible already like so
84:55 - something like you know create react app
84:58 - with a UI frame
85:02 - work you know already there and you just
85:05 - put the pieces together pop in some data
85:08 - you have an app right you won't be able
85:10 - to customise it too much if you don't
85:12 - really want to get into that but at
85:15 - least you'll have something that's
85:16 - functional
85:17 - I think that's important once you have
85:21 - some function you can always mess with
85:22 - it and you know adapt it as your skills
85:25 - get better
85:44 - see
85:59 - okay so in response to what we were
86:02 - talking about earlier two dead zombies
86:04 - question the dead zombie says never try
86:07 - to framework before use a lot of custom
86:09 - CSS for my school projects also yeah I'm
86:12 - learning through a free code cam thanks
86:14 - for your opinion you're welcome
86:17 - no problem hopefully it's helpful to you
86:27 - okay so so GS nity says well if I want
86:33 - to be a just a back-end guy what should
86:35 - I start with which would be easier if
86:37 - I'm completely new to web dev okay so
86:43 - you're saying you want to be in web
86:44 - development but you're not worried about
86:46 - front-end now what if you just wanted to
86:48 - do back in I don't know I mean I'm
86:52 - probably not the best person to answer
86:54 - this question because I am I'm more of a
86:56 - front-end person but in terms of
86:58 - back-end like you know date just the
87:01 - basics of databases you know either
87:04 - you know sequel or no sequel it doesn't
87:05 - really matter you know learn how to
87:08 - interact with a database
87:09 - build api's so I would I mean for sure
87:13 - you REST API is right everybody uses
87:16 - those but I would even check out
87:17 - something like graph QL that seems to be
87:19 - like the new thing that in my opinion
87:22 - graph QL seems superior to REST API and
87:27 - I'm I'm excited for the day whenever you
87:31 - know most of the REST API czar instead
87:33 - graph QL API but yeah I would so I think
87:43 - what other back-end things yeah I mean I
87:49 - would definitely at least learn some
87:51 - JavaScript so it's not going to be as
87:52 - foreign to you as HTML and CSS would be
87:56 - you don't need to go full-on JavaScript
87:58 - if you're just gonna stick with back-end
88:00 - but you know that would help bridge the
88:03 - gap a bit so you can understand like
88:05 - what you know some of what's going on
88:08 - client side and then if you wanted to
88:10 - handle some things in nodejs on the
88:12 - backend you know you could you could
88:14 - pick that up but you know PHP is still
88:20 - really popular back and language for for
88:24 - the web so I mean you have things like
88:27 - WordPress which is built in PHP Drupal
88:30 - you know those are your big PHP ones
88:34 - what else I'm pretty sure Jun loves PHP
88:37 - C I mean you have those and then you
88:39 - also have the whole realm of like you
88:43 - know dotnet stuff right so if you're
88:46 - familiar with C++ it might not be that
88:50 - big of a jump to get into c-sharp you
88:54 - know get into some dotnet framework
88:55 - things so any I mean you have a lot of
89:01 - options really at this point I think
89:03 - your best bet would be to read up on
89:07 - some of your different language options
89:09 - so for back-end you know php.net
89:12 - framework nodejs read them up on them
89:16 - maybe do some like basic tutorial things
89:18 - on them just to get a feel for it and
89:20 - then you know if you have up at that
89:24 - point if you really like one over the
89:26 - other then go for that my other advice
89:29 - in this kind of thing is always if you
89:32 - have a certain company you would love to
89:34 - work for or a few companies find out
89:38 - what stack they use and learn that right
89:41 - because if you have no idea how to use
89:44 - their stack or whatever language they're
89:46 - using the odds of you getting a job
89:47 - there are probably pretty low so if you
89:51 - let's say you don't really care what
89:53 - language you use but you do care about
89:56 - you know where you work then that's
90:00 - another you know another way to go about
90:01 - it anyway hopefully that that helps you
90:05 - out a little bit it can be really tough
90:07 - at the beginning when you're when you're
90:09 - trying to figure out what do I learn
90:11 - once you start to get an idea for what
90:14 - you really like and can start to
90:15 - specialize I think that's when it gets
90:17 - really fun it's tough because once you
90:19 - specialize in one thing you're saying no
90:20 - to everything else but then you start to
90:23 - really feel like you know what you're
90:25 - doing and that you're building cool
90:28 - things at least that's been my
90:32 - experience
90:42 - okay Sebastian says I have Windows 10
90:45 - with their fluent design and as many
90:46 - things borrowed from material design
90:48 - yeah I agree I don't use Windows 10
90:53 - often but I have been checking out
90:57 - office 365 so recently well I get within
91:02 - the last year I was on a committee to
91:04 - choose between switching over or my
91:06 - university to office 365 or G suite so
91:10 - we had to test out both systems and I
91:13 - thought the same thing I thought that
91:16 - Microsoft designed definitely at times
91:20 - felt a little bit like material design
91:23 - which was cool I
91:27 - they said I really think diversity of
91:30 - design is great for making really
91:32 - awesome things that look nice but
91:33 - uniformity is great for user experience
91:36 - so I'm not against it
91:47 - John Henson says bootstrap is a great
91:50 - way to understand the first steps into
91:52 - the whole NPM and node setup and using
91:54 - an editor the documentation is amazing
91:57 - for it - no beer recommends even if you
92:05 - want to just be a back-end developer you
92:07 - should probably know a little bit of
92:09 - HTML CSS and JavaScript so yeah yeah I
92:11 - mean that's I think that's good advice
92:13 - and really HTML and CSS are not they're
92:20 - not that hard to learn and I always shy
92:23 - away from saying oh it's easy because
92:25 - everything seems easy once you've been
92:27 - doing it for years right but in this
92:30 - case I really do believe that in terms
92:35 - of every you know the the entire
92:37 - computer science realm right if we want
92:42 - to talk about which things are hard to
92:43 - learn which things are easy HTML CSS are
92:47 - definitely on the easy side of things to
92:49 - learn so if you've been able to
92:51 - comprehend other concepts like in C++
92:55 - and Java if you just took some time and
92:58 - really worked on CSS and HTML just to
93:02 - get some basic understanding I think
93:04 - you'll be fine
93:15 - john hanson still has winamp installed
93:19 - and uses it that's awesome I didn't even
93:22 - realize when amp was like still still a
93:24 - thing that's really cool yeah I actually
93:33 - I use Spotify all the time now so I
93:38 - don't have any like any player any media
93:42 - player that I use other than that
93:54 - let's see Sumanth s kindly suggest me a
93:59 - few important interview questions where
94:01 - node is used as a back end hmm
94:08 - so basically what questions should a
94:10 - back-end developer prepare for would be
94:12 - my question I don't really know that I
94:17 - that I would know that especially if you
94:25 - wanted to be a back-end developer I mean
94:27 - I guess if you wanted to be a front-end
94:29 - developer and they just wanted to know
94:30 - like do you know some basic stuff I
94:33 - don't know maybe I'd be more helpful
94:35 - there yeah I don't know I don't want to
94:41 - try to guess and give you silly
94:42 - questions so I'm not going to pretend
94:43 - like I'm qualified for that but I will
94:46 - say there are definitely some resources
94:49 - out there so I mean I don't want to just
94:52 - give you the answer you would but really
94:55 - recently I was involved in an interview
94:57 - process for a web developer and I
94:59 - googled a lot of questions to ask during
95:03 - the interviews and there's there's a lot
95:05 - out there a lot of good stuff out there
95:08 - so I don't think it'll be very hard for
95:13 - you to find some questions should I
95:17 - think Stack Overflow jobs I think has
95:22 - some resources where they they have on
95:24 - their blog or something like that they
95:27 - have interview questions for different
95:28 - types of developers so I would check
95:30 - there I know there are lists on github
95:33 - of interview questions just off the top
95:37 - of my head those are two resources that
95:39 - that I had used and and we actually took
95:43 - some of those questions and use them for
95:46 - the for the interviews
95:52 - that zombie says yeah I love watching
95:54 - your streams awesome I appreciate that
95:57 - let me say I just got a slack message I
96:00 - want to check and make sure it's nothing
96:03 - I need to handle right now all right
96:10 - yeah nothing it's I don't know about you
96:14 - all but it for me for my department
96:16 - slack is I would say like I don't know
96:20 - 70% used maybe 75% used for just kind of
96:26 - casual talking and joking and 25% for
96:30 - actual work-related stuff so but I still
96:33 - like to check if I get something that
96:36 - might be important
96:41 - let's see Mandela effect conference ass
96:47 - is laravel good or not
96:50 - honestly I I have no knowledge at all of
96:54 - laravel so hopefully somebody in the
96:57 - live chat knows let's see
97:01 - Oh actually shinobi er says larva is a
97:04 - popular one and a powerful one of the
97:06 - PHP frameworks nowadays that's it okay
97:09 - now that you say that I did know that it
97:13 - was associated with PHP so but that's
97:18 - about the extent of my knowledge no beer
97:23 - asked what's the software you're using
97:25 - for live video on YouTube Sebastian said
97:29 - OBS yeah it's it's OBS so actually oh
97:34 - man I'm sorry I forgot I just put this
97:36 - on the screen and it's probably like
97:38 - yeah it is I can't believe I didn't
97:40 - notice that let me flip this over I just
97:43 - wanted to make sure that the camera was
97:49 - like basically centered on me I was
97:51 - worried I was out of the frame so anyway
97:54 - sorry about that
98:03 - GS the T says what what is dotnet and if
98:08 - it how is it different from no jazz okay
98:12 - so I'm just going to read off some of
98:16 - the answers to that because I think
98:17 - there's already some good answers in
98:18 - here Mandela effect conference says
98:21 - dotnet asp.net c-sharp are all Microsoft
98:26 - stuff access there's a bootcamp in Ohio
98:29 - for c-sharp yes so GSN to teach I have
98:35 - select my last two streams any of my
98:37 - streams that are from like it says
98:39 - Project three I'm using dotnet stuff so
98:43 - basically it's just another kind of way
98:48 - of building backends for for a website
98:51 - so I don't know if you're familiar at
98:54 - all with WordPress but WordPress uses
98:56 - PHP to put together little snippets of
99:00 - HTML and make these basically templates
99:04 - for pages that grab the data from a
99:07 - database insert it into these templates
99:10 - put it all together and then send to the
99:13 - client to the you know to the browser
99:15 - from the server HTML right so with
99:21 - dotnet you're using c-sharp and asp.net
99:25 - to do the same thing to piece together
99:27 - pieces of HTML that then get populated
99:32 - with data from a database right so it's
99:35 - that's all it does right and so it I
99:41 - guess it's just what it comes down to
99:47 - they all do the same thing right so most
99:50 - of your your back in web languages we're
99:54 - doing to do the same thing right it's
99:55 - it's all just piecing together HTML and
99:58 - combining it with data so it's just a
100:02 - matter of what language do you like like
100:05 - I said what language do you like working
100:06 - with or what language does the company
100:10 - use that you really want to work
100:13 - Blake asks what is the general consensus
100:16 - on Ruby Ruby on Rails I don't know I've
100:21 - never used it from what I've heard
100:22 - though I've heard it's it's simply
100:27 - simple to learn and use but I can't
100:30 - verify that personally that's just what
100:32 - what I've heard from articles people on
100:34 - YouTube
100:44 - akshay says where can we get the
100:47 - Microsoft patches for Windows 10.1 I
100:53 - don't really know like I said so I don't
100:57 - hopefully somebody in the live chat can
100:58 - give a better answer here but I don't
101:04 - like I said I rarely use Windows 10 so
101:09 - I'm not really up on when the when the
101:11 - updates are coming out
101:25 - okay so rich Rishabh says I work as
101:29 - full-stack developer with meteor and
101:32 - react native oh that's cool
101:37 - I've seen some demos with meteor and it
101:40 - seems it seems really cool I want to
101:43 - learn more about it
102:07 - shroo John says hi I have created my own
102:10 - portfolio website on github pages using
102:12 - bootstrap and there's some Python a
102:14 - JavaScript I wish to make augmented
102:16 - reality apps that's really cool that's
102:20 - that's cool too I think that's a really
102:25 - cool area to get into you know cuz it's
102:27 - just it's so new it's awesome to be part
102:30 - of something that's new and changing so
102:32 - fast but true John asks what can I learn
102:35 - next I don't really know I mean with
102:42 - augmented reality like I'm I'm not sure
102:46 - it seems these days there's a way to do
102:49 - everything with JavaScript so I'm sure
102:51 - she'd learn more JavaScript there's
102:53 - probably some library out there that
102:56 - lets you do augmented reality with it I
102:58 - just am not familiar with it right now
103:03 - other than that I don't really know does
103:06 - anyone know what's what's the commonly
103:08 - used thing for augmented reality right
103:11 - now I'm just I really haven't even
103:15 - checked into it so sorry I can't be more
103:20 - more more help to you I'm just not
103:21 - really I think it's really cool what I'm
103:24 - excited about more augmented reality
103:25 - stuff but I don't really have very much
103:28 - knowledge about what's being used right
103:31 - now for it okay Umberto's says Visual
103:37 - Studio has hololens development stuff if
103:40 - you don't like mine learning dotnet okay
103:43 - cool
103:44 - that that makes sense you know hololens
103:47 - being Microsoft's products
103:56 - see sumon says you are so wonderful that
103:59 - you take time to read everyone's
104:01 - comments I'm watching all your live
104:03 - streams just for this Oh awesome that's
104:05 - cool I appreciate that
104:06 - sometimes I worry because occasionally I
104:09 - get comments from people that say like
104:10 - you talk too much and they I mean that's
104:13 - that's fine I I don't deny that I talk a
104:16 - lot
104:16 - sometimes I go off on tangents but
104:18 - sometimes I wonder like should should I
104:21 - have more coding and not do so much
104:23 - question answer stuff at the end but
104:26 - it's good to know that that you like the
104:29 - question-and-answer stuff so that's what
104:32 - I think I think there's a few unique
104:34 - things about this stream and one of the
104:37 - unique things I think is the the live
104:40 - chat the interaction the
104:42 - question-and-answer stuff I mean I'm not
104:47 - saying the only person that does it
104:48 - certainly I haven't watched everybody
104:50 - else's streams to know but I I think
104:53 - it's kind of a cool feature
105:12 - okay Umberto also says Google has a our
105:15 - core for augmented reality iPhone has a
105:20 - art kit okay cool
105:24 - this is cool info okay and Umberto's
105:28 - said that he did just hear about a
105:30 - javascript framework for AR meaning
105:32 - augmented reality but can't remember
105:34 - what it is okay cool I mean there's like
105:37 - I said there's got to be something for
105:40 - jobs I just read an article yesterday
105:43 - about doing machine learning with
105:47 - JavaScript it was actually like a mess
105:49 - in the comments though there are people
105:51 - saying you definitely shouldn't do it
105:54 - something about the way that math is
105:57 - done in JavaScript but anyway I had to
106:00 - quit reading it because I was realized
106:02 - like hey this has nothing to do with
106:04 - anything I'm working on so it's probably
106:06 - a waste but anyway it does just seems
106:09 - like you can do everything in JavaScript
106:12 - these days oh cool Americo says a rjs
106:15 - that makes sense and that's easy to
106:18 - remember awesome on bears up
106:26 - Oh shrew John says Google's a our core
106:29 - is limited to only pixels and si oh wow
106:34 - that's cool so I have a pixel maybe I
106:36 - should check it out since I can since I
106:40 - can develop with that no beer says yeah
106:48 - you talk too much but I like it ha ha
106:51 - all right that's cool I'm one of those
107:00 - people that I'm really quiet at first
107:03 - but once I get started up I talk a lot
107:05 - alright there sometimes I'm in meetings
107:08 - and I say nothing like literally
107:11 - literally I was in a meeting a few days
107:13 - ago and one of my bosses said are you
107:18 - gonna say anything at the end and I just
107:19 - shook my head I had enough I felt like I
107:22 - had nothing valuable to add to the
107:24 - conversation so I just I wasn't going to
107:27 - talk but anyway
107:38 - okay so Regan asks is it possible to
107:42 - learn to only learn a JavaScript library
107:44 - without learning JavaScript itself I
107:50 - would I would give it a qualified yes
107:55 - and the qualification would be you would
107:58 - certainly have to learn some JavaScript
108:00 - to be able to use the library you could
108:05 - probably get away with only learning a
108:07 - certain amount of JavaScript and not
108:09 - let's say mastering everything and then
108:13 - as to whether or not that's advisable I
108:16 - don't I don't know I mean you could
108:18 - probably build some things like that but
108:21 - at some point you would if you want to
108:23 - get better and be able to really
108:25 - customize and do things with that
108:27 - framework outside just the very normal
108:30 - scope of it you probably wouldn't want
108:33 - to learn more JavaScript so I don't know
108:37 - hopefully that's an okay answer dead
108:42 - zombie says considering that javascript
108:45 - library is based on JavaScript I think
108:47 - you do need to learn JavaScript before
108:49 - you try learning libraries yeah yeah so
108:55 - yeah I think I'm kind of the same way
108:58 - right like if I were to if you were to
109:00 - ask me what I thought was the best way
109:03 - to learn everything then I would say
109:05 - yeah try to learn JavaScript and then
109:08 - get into a library instead of the other
109:10 - way around but if the question is is it
109:13 - possible to learn a library without
109:17 - learning JavaScript yeah yeah and and by
109:21 - not learning JavaScript I mean not
109:23 - learning a lot of JavaScript you
109:25 - definitely do need some Blake says I
109:29 - like the comments I'm the same way
109:32 - not talking talking cool
109:35 - cool you understand Mandela effect
109:39 - conference says start with HTML CSS
109:41 - jQuery then go to vanilla JavaScript
109:43 - yeah actually that's a common thing
109:46 - really now that I think about it so I
109:48 - guess if you want to talk about you know
109:52 - is a JavaScript library a lot of people
109:56 - who do start with jQuery and it helps
109:59 - them to you know manipulate the Dom and
110:01 - do some cool things without getting into
110:04 - the JavaScript so I'm not sure how I
110:07 - feel about that that's how I started out
110:11 - but it's it's hard to switch it it is
110:14 - really hard to force yourself to learn
110:16 - how to do it in vanilla JavaScript
110:19 - because the jQuery Way is often so much
110:23 - easier so I don't know I mean jQuery
110:28 - allowed me to get a lot of cool stuff
110:30 - done and you know make money building
110:33 - websites so I don't I don't regret that
110:37 - but I do think I probably would have
110:39 - gotten better at JavaScript faster if I
110:42 - had forced myself not to use it but I
110:45 - wasn't really in a position to be picky
110:46 - about things you know I had I had to pay
110:49 - the bills I had to feed my kids and I
110:52 - had to take on clients that needed work
110:54 - done so I mean I just I need to get it
110:56 - done and jQuery can certainly help you
110:58 - do that but if you did have the luxury
111:04 - of being able to you know try to learn
111:06 - things exactly in the way you want to
111:08 - you know however you want to learn them
111:10 - then I don't know that I would have done
111:13 - jQuery first
111:25 - okay
111:28 - I'm pretty sure I got all the questions
111:30 - in I'm just gonna glance quickly here at
111:33 - the end of the live chat
111:45 - okay Umberto had a useful comment here
111:49 - in terms of us we're talking about
111:52 - Google's AR core only working with with
111:55 - a limited amount of funds here
111:58 - Umberto's says they are working on
112:00 - making it available for all their
112:01 - devices it'll just be a more lightweight
112:03 - version since they won't necessarily
112:04 - have the optimized hardware okay cool
112:09 - that's good to know yeah I really want
112:16 - to get into some of that stuff augmented
112:17 - reality stuff seems really cool maybe I
112:21 - can find some way to get into it as a
112:25 - project for work that would be pretty
112:27 - awesome otherwise I don't know that I'll
112:30 - have that much time as a side project
112:32 - but okay Blake said did you talk about
112:40 - the Ruby on Rails I didn't catch that
112:42 - yeah you know what
112:43 - I remember saying something about it but
112:46 - I don't think we I went on to read
112:51 - anything else about Ruby on Rails I
112:55 - think the only thing I said about it was
112:58 - that I thought it was supposed to be
113:02 - pretty simple to pick up and learn how
113:05 - to use
113:12 - okay and now I can trying to look back
113:16 - up in the chat for things on Ruby on
113:18 - Rails so I'm not seeing anything right
113:19 - now
113:31 - okay Mandela effect conference did say
113:39 - something similar to Ruby on Rails might
113:41 - be a PHP framework Ruby language I don't
113:44 - know what is similar that is actually
113:46 - used crystal language is similar to Ruby
113:49 - but is not used okay so I think that's
113:53 - all I found on Ruby as far as I know
113:58 - Ruby on Rails was like gained a lot of
114:00 - profit popularity out only years ago I
114:03 - don't remember about how many years ago
114:05 - but it seems like it's lost some
114:07 - popularity right around the same time
114:10 - that nodejs is kind of gained popularity
114:13 - oh that's just my observation I don't
114:18 - really have numbers you know on hand to
114:20 - back that up but I just don't hear rails
114:25 - talked about quite as much as I used to
114:38 - okay
114:42 - okay sorry so Blake repeated said that
114:46 - said my question was what is the general
114:49 - consensus on Ruby on Rails okay all
114:53 - right so I mean what I just said
114:55 - basically is pretty much my opinion on
114:56 - Rails just like you can certainly still
114:59 - use rails to build stuff it works and
115:03 - people still use it but if you had to
115:06 - ask me like if if you want to position
115:08 - yourself to have great like job skills
115:11 - that are in demand it just does seem
115:14 - like it seems like it's just losing
115:24 - popularity right so PHP to be honest
115:31 - with you because of how popular
115:33 - WordPress is I think PHP is still really
115:37 - valid to know node has really grown and
115:45 - continues to grow especially like with
115:49 - Reax popularity you know a lot of reacts
115:51 - although you don't necessarily need node
115:55 - need to use known as a back-end it seems
115:58 - like a lot of the time node is the back
116:00 - end so for me at least I'm focusing on
116:06 - learning more node stuff for back-end I
116:10 - learned the I use other stuff when I
116:12 - have to for like a legacy project but I
116:19 - don't know that I would recommend unless
116:21 - someone had a really good reason for
116:23 - wanting to learn rails I don't know that
116:25 - I would recommend it as you know being
116:28 - like the best career move that they
116:30 - could make
116:36 - but once again I'm gonna say like if you
116:39 - happen to really like it
116:40 - go with it if you know the company
116:42 - really like uses it go with it but just
116:46 - in general I don't know that I would
116:48 - recommend it but I never used it so take
116:53 - that into consideration with my answer
116:55 - as well let's see Reagan asked between
117:04 - PHP and Python which language is the
117:06 - best for you know bear says PHP is best
117:11 - I think it depends on what you want to
117:20 - do if you're talking about web
117:22 - development deal with PHP if you're
117:25 - talking about machine learning go with
117:27 - Python data science I will go with
117:30 - Python and that's just based on what the
117:33 - most popular languages are for those
117:36 - things I've rarely ever hear of people
117:39 - using Python in regard to web
117:41 - development but PHP is all over the
117:44 - place and even things like like all your
117:47 - shared hosting environments you know are
117:50 - running PHP stuff all the time it seems
117:53 - like I don't know that I've ever tried
117:56 - to run Python on them so maybe they run
117:58 - Python - I don't I just don't know but I
118:04 - do know at least right now from what
118:07 - I've read for things like data science
118:09 - and machine learning Python is the the
118:13 - number one language being used
118:23 - Mandela effect conference says rails is
118:26 - on the decline in the US Europe and US
118:29 - says Europe and Australia might be
118:30 - better but not sure okay so that seems
118:35 - to be the consensus that rails are still
118:38 - used but it is you know declining at
118:41 - least in the u.s. okay
118:44 - rich rich Hobbs says is is happy jsh api
118:49 - je s better a better alternative to
118:52 - meteor for rest services
118:55 - I don't really know I've I probably know
119:06 - more about meteor than I know about
119:08 - happy so but but really it's it's very
119:13 - limited it's limited to seeing other
119:15 - people do stuff with it so I don't know
119:18 - that I can really answer that so sorry I
119:20 - just don't have enough experience with
119:23 - it to give you a good answer
119:30 - Bert Burke so BER ke so sorry if I'm
119:35 - pronouncing that wrong let me know if
119:37 - I'm if I am I'll pronounce it right
119:39 - so Berg says hi when when is react going
119:43 - to be available in free code camp I
119:51 - don't know
119:53 - so it seems like the the answer that
119:57 - Quincy always gives is soon basically
120:04 - the answer is when it's when we're
120:06 - confident that it's ready it will be it
120:10 - will be released and I actually don't
120:16 - have anything to do with developing that
120:18 - so I really I don't have any more
120:20 - information than you all have with that
120:23 - so there are a lot of other people
120:25 - volunteering to to make that work and it
120:29 - github so you can check check out github
120:32 - and just see like how many pull requests
120:35 - are there in bugs and things and if you
120:37 - really you know kind of want to dig
120:38 - deeper and find out where you know where
120:41 - that projects at or even help I'm sure
120:46 - that would it would appreciate any help
120:49 - that you could give
120:58 - see
121:02 - timo says I personally feel like it will
121:05 - take a while before the beta which will
121:07 - include react is ready yeah honestly I
121:11 - have no idea it's been a long time since
121:14 - I even checked out the beta I know it's
121:18 - been a long time in development but I
121:20 - don't know it's still hard to me like I
121:23 - said I'm not involved in it but I would
121:26 - imagine it's got to be hard to try to
121:28 - come up with a curriculum for web
121:30 - development because it changes so fast
121:32 - you know if you take too long to develop
121:35 - it the stuff you did at the beginning is
121:37 - probably already outdated so that's I
121:42 - mean that's a challenging thing so I
121:45 - mean I appreciate everybody working on
121:47 - that because it's got to be tough okay
121:54 - Timo says there are a lot of issues to
121:55 - resolve before it's usable okay so it
121:59 - may be a while I don't know but I'm like
122:01 - that I'm sure if there are more people
122:03 - that are helping out with things it
122:07 - could be ready so I would you know if if
122:09 - you have any time at all to to volunteer
122:13 - to help with that check it out you know
122:16 - check out some of the some of the issues
122:18 - see if you can solve some of them and
122:22 - see Rishabh says for awhile we can use
122:29 - [Music]
122:32 - Codecademy introduction to react yeah
122:38 - I've done their intro to react I don't
122:42 - know they may have updated it from when
122:44 - I did it but when I did it it was it
122:46 - wasn't bad it helped I hope I learned
122:49 - some of the basic stuff didn't really
122:52 - make me an expert but it got me through
122:55 - some of the basic stuff which was nice
122:58 - especially if you don't want to have to
123:00 - deal with a lot of the setup to run on
123:02 - your local machine it's it's good to be
123:04 - able to do some in browser stuff alright
123:09 - another question
123:12 - Regan s can we call web developer a
123:16 - software engineer I don't I don't know I
123:31 - wouldn't personally
123:34 - would there be some justification for
123:37 - that I don't I don't really know I know
123:39 - there's like heated debate about terms
123:41 - of which you can call different
123:44 - developers and engineers and things like
123:46 - that so I'm not gonna I don't really
123:52 - need to feel like I don't have enough
123:53 - information to weigh in on that question
123:57 - to be honest with you when it comes to
124:02 - titles in this industry it seems almost
124:04 - like whatever you like whatever job you
124:10 - can convince somebody that you can do
124:12 - like that's your title because some of
124:15 - these titles are just like I just I feel
124:19 - like sometimes they don't really mean
124:20 - that much because it's such a broad
124:23 - range of things right I mean we're in an
124:25 - industry where people have titles like
124:27 - JavaScript ninja right I mean or like
124:32 - PHP wizard I mean you know it's like I
124:37 - don't really know what makes somebody an
124:40 - engineer as opposed to a programmer or a
124:42 - developer if there's some resource out
124:47 - there that clearly defines those terms
124:49 - for our industry then you know that'd be
124:53 - great but I don't know about it so I'm a
124:58 - like I said I would not call myself an
125:00 - engineer but I wouldn't be a poet if
125:04 - somebody offered a job calling me a
125:05 - front-end engineer I'll take it that
125:10 - sounds like a cool title if somebody
125:14 - wanted to hire me to do front-end work
125:16 - but my title would be software engineer
125:19 - I'll I would take it I mean I I would
125:22 - think it would be weird you know but I
125:27 - wouldn't be like totally opposed to it
125:33 - let's see okay Timo says I'm a core team
125:36 - member for the free code can't beta
125:39 - curriculum so we can definitely use the
125:41 - help of more active contributors Oh
125:43 - awesome
125:44 - cool so Timo thanks for for your
125:48 - contributions and being a core team
125:50 - member that's awesome and thanks for the
125:53 - info no beer says no to the question of
125:59 - web developers being called a software
126:01 - engineer Timo says I believe in Texas a
126:04 - four-year degree is required to have the
126:06 - title of engineer uh-huh I had never
126:09 - even considered that so I guess in some
126:11 - places the title engineer is I guess
126:15 - legally may be reserved to certain
126:18 - degrees that's really interesting rish
126:24 - up says I've been working on react Redux
126:26 - in graph QL so it's always good to do
126:31 - something new that's cool I'll probably
126:34 - right now I'm working on react to Redux
126:35 - I really do want to learn more about
126:37 - graph QL so I'll be following the same
126:39 - path there Mandela effect as most
126:46 - engineering degrees five years I don't
126:49 - really know I'm pretty sure you can do
126:54 - four year engineering degrees I'm trying
127:00 - to think I do know somebody that got
127:03 - their engineering degree I'm just trying
127:06 - to remember when they graduated I'm
127:11 - pretty sure they did it in four years
127:12 - but I'm not positive
127:17 - I mean it's always possible that they
127:19 - took a bunch of summer classes and it
127:20 - should have been a five year degree and
127:22 - they just did it before I don't I don't
127:24 - know
127:26 - okay well I'm to the end of the live
127:29 - chat here and this stream has gone on
127:32 - for quite a while now so I can feel my
127:36 - throat starting to go too so I don't
127:37 - want to completely lose my voice so now
127:39 - is a great time to to wrap things up so
127:45 - thanks so much everyone for for watching
127:48 - and let's see looks like there's some
127:52 - more questions what question come in
127:55 - coming in so I'm gonna leave I'm gonna
127:59 - because we seem to get a never-ending
128:00 - stream of questions so if I don't get
128:03 - your question if you're putting it in
128:04 - right now into the live chat go ahead
128:06 - and ask me - for tomorrow stream or you
128:09 - can send me a send me a message on on
128:14 - Twitter or some other social media and
128:16 - you put in the comments to the video you
128:18 - could join our slack channel for this
128:20 - stream and ask everyone in there I think
128:23 - the link to the slack channel is in the
128:24 - description so next next stream is
128:30 - probably going to be tomorrow around 2
128:32 - p.m. Eastern time so same time is today
128:34 - unless something comes up and then I'll
128:36 - either reschedule or cancel but I'll let
128:38 - everyone know on Twitter in any case
128:42 - what's gonna happen yeah I think that's
128:47 - it all right so again thank you everyone
128:50 - and really really great chat at the end
128:53 - there it went on for quite a while and a
128:56 - lot of great questions and answers I
128:58 - appreciate appreciate all of it all the
129:01 - questions and answers and yes so have a
129:07 - great day I'll see y'all tomorrow
129:12 - you
