00:00 - Hi, I'm Briana from freeCodeCamp.
00:02 - Let's quick review.
00:03 - The four basic parts 
of a computer are:
00:06 - the Input–like the mouse 
or the keyboard
00:08 - The Output– what you're 
seeing on the monitor
00:10 - or hearing through
 the speakers
00:11 - the CPU– the 
Central Processing Unit
00:14 - and the Memory.
00:15 - Now Memory can be short-term 
memory called RAM
00:18 - or longer term memory. 
That is usually is a hard drive,
00:21 - but can also be like 
a CD-ROM or Flash Drive
00:25 - anything like that.
00:26 - In addition to those 
four basic parts,
00:28 - we have three more things 
we're going to discuss today.
00:30 - The Motherboard, Expansion Cards, 
and Power Supply.
00:34 - The Motherboard is what 
connects everything.
00:37 - While the data is flying 
around over here
00:38 - trying to figure out 
where to go,
00:40 - the Motherboard 
helps route it.
00:42 - So it goes to the 
right place.
00:44 - Expansion cards are 
sound cards, video cards,
00:46 - that kind of thing that 
can really up your experience
00:49 - as a user.
00:50 - Power supply is 
as it sounds–
00:52 - what gets power 
to the computer.
00:54 - It's usually the part of the 
computer that has that fan on
00:56 - it to keep it from overheating.
00:58 - So let's do a quick review.
01:00 - In addition to the 
four basic parts of
01:01 - Input/Output, Central Processing Unit, 
and Memory
01:05 - We usually have a 
Motherboard, Expansion Cards,
01:08 - and a Power Supply.
