00:06 - everyone welcome to live coding with
00:09 - Jessie today we're going to do some
00:12 - things with graph Q up
00:14 - so if you've never heard of graph QL
00:19 - before or maybe you just haven't worked
00:21 - with it yet I'm gonna do my best to
00:23 - explain things
00:25 - just start out let me go through some of
00:28 - the technology that we're using and then
00:31 - that way if you want to go check it out
00:33 - at least you'll have the names of
00:35 - everything you can check out some
00:37 - previous streams as well to see where we
00:39 - set up some of these things
00:41 - but first of all we're building a react
00:45 - website and we're using Apollo to help
00:50 - us write the you know graph QL queries
00:53 - to get the data we're getting the data
00:55 - from a my sequel database right through
00:59 - WordPress right so it's just a normal
01:00 - WordPress installation
01:02 - but we also have added a plug-in called
01:05 - WP graph QL that's gonna let us send
01:08 - queries to that plug-in and then it's
01:12 - going to do its thing to get the data
01:13 - that we need and then send it back
01:16 - to our react app
01:19 - so what we need to do today is
01:24 - write the correct query to get the data
01:27 - that we need and be able to display that
01:30 - data on the page so we've done that once
01:33 - already for a different page and Harshit
01:37 - who is frequently on the channel
01:39 - frequent contributor really talented
01:42 - coder has already set a lot of this up
01:46 - for us so this isn't going to be a from
01:49 - scratch video
01:52 - but
01:53 - we you will get at least some of the
01:56 - basics of how graph QL works
01:59 - all right I apologize for
02:03 - scheduling this stream so late this was
02:08 - busy with other things and then just it
02:10 - kind of realized how late it was thought
02:12 - oh
02:13 - schedule this so I know there's probably
02:15 - gonna be some of you who won't get to
02:18 - see this live because you won't get the
02:21 - notification to later so I apologize for
02:23 - that I'll do my best to schedule earlier
02:26 - tomorrow
02:28 - also sorry that I wasn't able to stream
02:31 - yesterday
02:32 - it was there's actually a water line
02:34 - break so the main road to get to where I
02:37 - work is the big hill there's a water
02:40 - line break at some point on the hill and
02:42 - water just went everywhere all over the
02:44 - road down the hill and it was so cold
02:46 - that it froze so no one could go up or
02:49 - down the road and so no one could get to
02:51 - work so that's why I didn't stream
02:55 - yesterday those at home and as many of
02:57 - you know my internet connection just
02:59 - can't handle streaming at home
03:01 - so
03:03 - anyway but I am in the office today it's
03:06 - warmed up and I think it's just slightly
03:08 - above freezing so roads should be fine
03:12 - so let's get started and
03:15 - if you have any questions just go ahead
03:18 - and put them in a live chat and I'll
03:20 - answer some questions a little bit later
03:22 - on in the stream I'm gonna start a timer
03:24 - here to remind me to check back in and
03:27 - answer those questions and
03:30 - so I have
03:32 - this is the data that we're going to try
03:35 - to get so I've pulled over and we've
03:38 - done this in previous streams if it's
03:40 - shown how I'm
03:41 - migrating data from sequel server
03:45 - database over into WordPress so I've
03:49 - migrated these
03:51 - they're called directories in the in the
03:54 - database so
03:55 - they're directors they're basically just
03:58 - listings of each department here at the
04:00 - University I work at and who works there
04:03 - with their title is what building
04:05 - they're in and what their phone number
04:06 - is so
04:09 - I'm hoping that they're all kind of in
04:11 - the same order we'll find out when we
04:13 - pull the data over but that's all we
04:16 - just need to pull over you know this
04:18 - piece of data is for the title and this
04:20 - piece of data here and
04:23 - we're just going to display that so I
04:25 - already have the I'd set up and we'll
04:28 - show you that now whoops I forgot to
04:32 - change the camera
04:33 - apologies
04:35 - here's what I was talking about we're
04:37 - just gonna grab this data say it wasn't
04:39 - really that important we're just gonna
04:40 - grab the title and the content from
04:42 - WordPress all right
04:47 - so let me show you
04:49 - first of all the page so we have a react
04:54 - component if you're familiar with react
04:56 - this should should look familiar to you
04:59 - just pretty much a normal react
05:01 - component we have some different things
05:03 - going on since we're using next we have
05:06 - this get initial props function
05:08 - available and this helps us be able to
05:12 - pull in data both on the server side and
05:14 - client side so anything that we try to
05:17 - grab inside of this function will also
05:20 - that that data wall so B input into the
05:24 - markup that is built on the server for
05:27 - our server-side rendering so that's
05:29 - pretty awesome and that that's an XJS
05:32 - thing so you won't find this in every
05:34 - react project and
05:37 - so what we this is a copy
05:42 - this was just a copy of one we've done
05:45 - already for our posts
05:47 - jas
05:48 - so we're just going to get the ID from
05:52 - our URL we're gonna pass it and when the
05:56 - user goes there and that's going to be
05:57 - the slug that we need to be able to
05:59 - display to be able to grab the right
06:03 - piece of data and then we're just going
06:06 - to display that so we have the title
06:12 - well we are we're gonna have to add one
06:16 - tag just to display the title but we'll
06:19 - wait till we get some data in before we
06:21 - put that in but we'll display the
06:25 - content here and I've already changed
06:27 - this to be directories so this is setup
06:31 - properly the only thing that we're going
06:33 - to need to change is we're not using
06:35 - this sample query anymore we're going to
06:38 - create a new query and I'll probably end
06:41 - up changing the name of this query when
06:43 - heart should set it up it was an example
06:44 - so that's why I was named sample query
06:46 - but I changed it you'll see here this
06:50 - query to be the post J s so we ought to
06:54 - change the name
06:55 - as well and
07:01 - actually our shits in the stream right
07:03 - now so hey everybody I see some activity
07:06 - on watch at harsh it let me know and
07:09 - anybody else who who's worked with graph
07:12 - QL let me know is it the common practice
07:14 - to have a different
07:17 - JavaScript file for each type of query
07:20 - or is it a more common practice to have
07:23 - multiple queries in the same file I
07:26 - think in a previous project we had
07:28 - multiple queries in the same file oh
07:31 - hey Jason's here Jason is the creator of
07:35 - WP graph kilo which is the plug-in on
07:37 - the WordPress side of things that is
07:40 - going to help us you get the data
07:45 - so that's awesome well when when Jason's
07:49 - here it's always a big help I appreciate
07:52 - it
07:54 - oscy so jason said in another meeting
07:57 - but it fall along yeah that's cool
08:00 - thanks thanks for joining us even though
08:03 - you're busy with another meeting I
08:04 - really appreciate it
08:09 - okay
08:15 - someone away it's like I'm not getting
08:19 - the response from hurshe maybe he's not
08:22 - able to watch live
08:29 - let's see
08:32 - alright so I really think I
08:39 - said I really kind of think it's gonna
08:42 - get there's gonna be way too many files
08:44 - if we try to put everything in a
08:46 - different file right
08:49 - okay harsh it's back arson I just wanted
08:52 - to know if it was common practice to
08:54 - have a different JavaScript file for
08:57 - each query or to put the queries all in
09:00 - one file or maybe hear them into several
09:02 - files
09:04 - part of what says hey how's it going all
09:07 - para I want to know which library Apollo
09:10 - we're using Apollo
09:14 - for our you know on the react side of
09:17 - things
09:22 - so in any case basically it's going to
09:26 - be very similar
09:30 - our query
09:34 - it's gonna be let me double check but I
09:37 - think it's going to be
09:39 - almost exactly the same
09:43 - obviously we're not gonna get we're not
09:45 - gonna say faculty we're gonna say
09:47 - directories and we're not gonna say
09:49 - faculty departments in fact I don't
09:52 - think we have any categories at all
10:03 - okay Harshit says that you can put
10:08 - you can actually put the queries right
10:11 - in the component if you're not going to
10:12 - reuse them i
10:15 - I think I want to keep them separate for
10:18 - now there's a chance that we may reuse
10:20 - some of these I'm thinking especially
10:23 - like this faculty
10:26 - query
10:28 - you know we may want to pull that in we
10:30 - talked last week about maybe having
10:32 - highlighting some faculty members on the
10:35 - homepage so we may want to pull in
10:37 - something
10:38 - from our faculty pages and I'm assuming
10:43 - you know we're gonna have some other
10:44 - things like that so for now I'm gonna
10:47 - make things everything a separate
10:49 - component if we want to when we go to
10:52 - refactor some of this if we find some
10:54 - things that we're sure we are not going
10:56 - to reuse we can always change it up
10:59 - let's see
11:06 - okay Paula asks we using Apollo server
11:10 - or Express graph QL
11:13 - let me see Harshit set this up we think
11:16 - our should I assume we're using Express
11:20 - graph QL because we do have expressed
11:23 - at least I was pretty sure we were
11:25 - running Express
11:27 - yet did I see it no
11:40 - are we not bringing anything in it right
11:43 - now for that I guess not
11:51 - all right so let's let's just make a
11:53 - whole new file then and eventually we're
11:56 - going to change this
12:00 - we will sort this out as far as kind of
12:06 - the standard names for our files in our
12:08 - queries but for now
12:11 - let's just grab all of this let's make a
12:15 - new file
12:17 - let's call this directories
12:23 - ojs let's paste this in and what's let's
12:29 - change our
12:32 - query name to
12:39 - directory query we're going to change
12:42 - this to
12:48 - directories and we don't need
12:54 - one two three
12:59 - just counting out loud the number of
13:02 - Semak or the number of curly brackets I
13:04 - have and I don't think we needed that at
13:06 - all let's see id title slug content that
13:10 - looks looks like what we need
13:14 - all right great so let me save that
13:25 - alright just an answer to par watts
13:29 - question
13:34 - let's see how it says we are using PHP
13:38 - WordPress graph QL server provided by WP
13:41 - graph QL plug-in and
13:43 - personally I recommend using Apollo
13:46 - server I
13:48 - like more than Express graph QL
13:59 - harsh it says install graph QL plug-in
14:05 - just feels code would have a plug-in
14:07 - syntax relatives queries oh
14:10 - all right
14:12 - whoo I will I won't so that I'm not
14:16 - gonna sell it right now during the video
14:19 - unless you all think that would be good
14:20 - to show let me know in the live chat if
14:23 - you'd like to see me install a Visual
14:27 - Studio code plug-in in the live stream
14:29 - otherwise I'll wait and do it later
14:32 - thanks for letting me know though
14:34 - that'll be useful because we're gonna
14:36 - end up writing a lot more of these
14:37 - queries before this project is over
14:42 - all right
14:46 - let's go back to our
14:49 - directory dot j s page
14:53 - component and let's change this to
15:03 - director is is I what I said let's see
15:06 - what I named it directory query
15:14 - directory query all right I want to set
15:17 - this up the same way
15:19 - so we had before
15:22 - wonderful
15:26 - all right
15:28 - let's see now I
15:31 - think we have enough to test this
15:37 - yeah
15:39 - so I already let me show you the server
15:41 - I've already changed this before so I
15:44 - added here in our server
15:48 - that when we want to go to when a user
15:51 - goes to
15:53 - our site's URL so be Franciscan dot edu
15:56 - slash contact slash whatever's after
15:59 - that second slash will get passed along
16:02 - as the ID
16:04 - to
16:06 - our directory component so
16:13 - the
16:17 - the route it's
16:20 - parameterised that's going to say so
16:22 - parameterised routing so you can check
16:24 - that out in the next
16:26 - documentation so even though next comes
16:29 - with its own router sometimes you still
16:31 - want to do some things like this not
16:34 - really hard to do so I'm if you want to
16:37 - see the full thing you check out the
16:38 - repo to check out the repo for next as
16:42 - well there's a link to this repository
16:44 - in the description below
16:49 - alright
16:51 - so let's go here I do want to make sure
16:55 - our slugs
16:57 - Counseling Center since we have this one
17:01 - up let's try to go to that one so we'll
17:05 - go I
17:07 - think it's three thousand yep so here's
17:10 - a site
17:12 - and let's say
17:15 - here we go I must have tried it before
17:18 - so the reason directory query is not
17:21 - defined
17:22 - alright that I'm not I must have missed
17:25 - a step let's check it out whoops I
17:28 - forgot to import it that's I figured
17:34 - directory query from
17:37 - directories
17:43 - so up here we're importing a lot of the
17:46 - different things that we need so if you
17:49 - didn't see I was importing the wrong
17:51 - query so when I try to call that query
17:54 - down here of course it didn't find
17:57 - anything
18:00 - the reason I'm using contact and not
18:02 - directories in the URL is because the
18:05 - current site uses contacts for
18:09 - for their URLs so I want to keep the URL
18:12 - so you can see here we are
18:16 - the data has come through and actually
18:19 - the title did come through so there must
18:21 - have been oh
18:22 - yeah it did have an h2 already in here
18:25 - so that's I was thinking I'd have to
18:27 - make an h2 in the component but it's
18:31 - already there that's wonderful and the
18:35 - formatting actually is not really that
18:37 - bad I think I can live with that
18:39 - formatting really I mean obviously we
18:42 - want well you know we're gonna want some
18:45 - padding and things like that but
18:47 - just in general
18:51 - not really too bad for that formatting
18:57 - I
19:01 - mean really if anything it might not be
19:04 - a bad idea to have it stacked so that
19:06 - it's you know named title and then
19:13 - building and phone number although since
19:16 - they've added this in is this this pipe
19:18 - here does make it difficult
19:22 - but not bad
19:28 - all right so let me
19:32 - let me test out a few more
19:36 - just to see if we have consistent in the
19:38 - consistency with all with our data I've
19:41 - checked a few but I haven't checked
19:43 - everything
19:44 - so let's go in here and see
19:48 - let me check out my department let's see
19:52 - what the slug is
20:09 - all right now about a little bit
20:10 - different so for some reason we have a
20:12 - lot of space in here and we have a phone
20:15 - number at the top but so not bad but the
20:19 - format of everything you know here is
20:21 - the same and there I am
20:26 - [Music]
20:27 - don't call me during the stream that
20:29 - will just feed the stress
20:31 - but
20:35 - all right not bad we just have to keep
20:37 - in mind it's kind of double-check these
20:40 - to
20:42 - fix the spacing and things
20:46 - let me try one more as I think we may
20:50 - have some departments that are a little
20:51 - irregular
21:03 - remember see if I can remember which one
21:06 - was a little bit
21:08 - different
21:14 - I see let's let's go through the say
21:19 - oops type the wrong thing in let's check
21:22 - out the live version of the site right
21:24 - now
21:29 - Franciscan dot edu slash
21:32 - contacts
21:37 - let's see general contact info
21:41 - admissions let me just open up several
21:53 - there we go admissions was the one that
21:56 - was that was different
21:59 - let's see if wow this is interested
22:03 - missions had a completely different URL
22:05 - as well
22:07 - maybe that didn't even come through see
22:10 - there's little things like this that
22:12 - are making this somewhat difficult
22:18 - no admissions wasn't even part of this
22:21 - so
22:24 - yeah what I I guess we'll just have to
22:28 - be aware of this and try to figure out
22:32 - you know what to do I'd love to keep as
22:36 - many of the URLs intact as I can but
22:39 - some of the structures not really I
22:43 - don't it doesn't make a ton of sense
22:45 - right so I I do get that this page is
22:50 - supposed to be for prospective students
22:52 - so they wanted to make it different
22:55 - maybe more attractive for students a
22:57 - little different layout
22:59 - but the whole change in URL makes it I
23:04 - don't know it just makes it problematic
23:07 - I guess for trying to organize
23:09 - everything so there may be some cases
23:11 - where we might want to display the same
23:12 - content on two different pages
23:15 - because you know I think it would make
23:18 - more sense to have admissions underneath
23:20 - that section of you know contact right
23:24 - but it it may also make sense to have
23:27 - the admissions counselors listed in the
23:30 - admissions section right also you can
23:35 - see who's not listed here there's some
23:37 - people maybe I just have to go to the
23:40 - next page but there are definitely some
23:41 - people in the department who are not
23:43 - listed here at all
23:45 - so
23:48 - for now we'll just go on to the next one
23:51 - alright this look standard
23:56 - department chairs
23:58 - all right that looks pretty standard I
24:01 - want to know if that actually came in
24:03 - contact up into my shoes
24:08 - great that did come in good contact
24:12 - directories I had this one
24:21 - I'm not sure what this one is
24:25 - why was that even in there
24:33 - Wow so development departments link is a
24:36 - link to a different site
24:41 - this is a bit of a mess
24:44 - let's I about three minutes left on this
24:49 - this Pomodoro cycle and then we'll go to
24:52 - the live chat but I
24:56 - think this is gonna be some
24:59 - change to how we do this because from a
25:03 - user experience standpoint I don't think
25:05 - this is the best if you're trying to go
25:08 - through and get contact info for this
25:10 - depart these departments
25:11 - you know there's a certain
25:14 - standard layout for some departments
25:17 - whether you go to admissions and it's
25:18 - different it doesn't even show all the
25:21 - employees you go to development and it
25:24 - takes you to the site where you have go
25:27 - to give money to the university it
25:29 - doesn't even list the people that work
25:30 - in development so
25:34 - we're gonna have you're gonna be
25:36 - different I think we're gonna maybe like
25:38 - have to either we'll do it you know I'll
25:41 - do it or we'll get someone else to do it
25:44 - put in in WordPress you know some extra
25:49 - directories that follow the standard
25:52 - pattern
25:53 - to make up for those sections that we're
25:56 - seeing here that that just link off to
25:58 - unexpected places
26:00 - even some of the office of Khattak
26:03 - addicts doesn't even have a link
26:04 - Community Relations I mean I realize
26:06 - they do have a phone number but
26:09 - you know what we'll have to see because
26:12 - this is definitely
26:15 - you know a bit confusing and
26:18 - we may have to to make a page like this
26:26 - so the page that is just contact will
26:30 - have to be
26:32 - may I don't think it all came in I
26:35 - thought it was this one
26:46 - yeah this does not look like it's the
26:48 - same
26:52 - as this page
26:57 - is it general contact info let me double
27:00 - check maybe it was
27:04 - yeah maybe it is okay so we do have this
27:07 - that's good
27:14 - alright so we maybe will just have to
27:17 - work out the URL then
27:20 - that's good news at least we have
27:23 - something to go on
27:24 - all right I'm gonna go to the live chat
27:26 - now I know we have a minute left but I
27:28 - mean what am I really gonna get done in
27:29 - a minute so let me start this short
27:31 - break timer and
27:34 - I'm gonna check out what's going on in
27:36 - the live chat
27:49 - so I got a little distracted I got a
27:51 - message from my wife I just she's asking
27:53 - me a coding question my wife's learning
27:55 - how to code she's doing the Flatiron
27:57 - school right now
28:23 - Mikey says
28:26 - something about spaghetti not sure not
28:29 - sure what you're referring to Mikey may
28:32 - have to
28:33 - [Music]
28:35 - clarify
28:44 - okay par what mentions saying a polo
28:47 - server is is not stable okay I'll keep
28:51 - that in mind thank you
29:04 - Nura asks why are you not in Facebook
29:07 - live I've never done Facebook live is
29:10 - there a reason why I should be on
29:11 - Facebook live as far as I know free code
29:14 - camp doesn't do live things on Facebook
29:17 - so we have a presence on YouTube I'm
29:21 - pretty sure there was a twitch channel
29:22 - as well but I don't think we do anything
29:24 - with that right now
29:31 - Paul watt says hey Jessie who set up
29:34 - this project
29:37 - Harshit did a lot of the setup so I mean
29:41 - I did the initial setup
29:43 - of
29:45 - you know next right and I created like
29:50 - some of the layout
29:52 - but then in terms of all the graph QL
29:55 - stuff
29:57 - Harshit set all that up so pretty much
30:00 - everything in this lib folder
30:03 - har should set up a little bit
30:06 - everything I've done in here has just
30:07 - been slight modifications you know based
30:09 - on our needs with the data
30:14 - so it's been a collaboration if you want
30:17 - to know really who did what check out
30:19 - the repo and look at the the commits
30:31 - let's see
30:38 - all right so harsh it said the name of
30:41 - the visual studio code plugin for graph
30:46 - QL is is in his blogs if you've never
30:49 - been to harsh its blog very helpful and
30:51 - informative it's HP tech blogs comm
30:55 - so check that out there's a lot of good
31:00 - good blog posts in there about you know
31:03 - react and different technologies for
31:06 - really like full stack development
31:10 - Paul watt says hello everyone I have a
31:12 - github repo of graph QL real ajs
31:15 - implemented you can check it out my
31:17 - username and github is par 108 so that's
31:20 - P a RW 8008
31:23 - thanks for what I appreciate that maybe
31:26 - I'll check that out see depending on how
31:28 - long the stream goes maybe I can check
31:30 - out out after I do have to leave work a
31:32 - bit early
31:33 - today so I may not have time but I
31:38 - will check that out
31:45 - JC Q says hi from Malaysia
31:49 - hey how's it going thanks for watching
31:56 - netskope says I always have trouble
31:59 - making navigation bars got any tips from
32:02 - me
32:04 - it depends on what you're using so if
32:10 - or if you want to let make it from
32:14 - scratch you know with just CSS HTML
32:21 - then I don't it just really depends on
32:23 - what style you want to make I would look
32:26 - at I usually copy and paste code from
32:30 - previous projects or check out how its
32:33 - implemented in other projects but if
32:35 - you're using some sort of framework if
32:39 - it is just a regular HTML site you know
32:41 - check out bootstrap or materialise or
32:44 - foundation or one of those and
32:47 - it'll help you a lot with the navigation
32:50 - borås if you're using react you can
32:53 - check out you know material UI or uh
32:57 - there's a react bootstrap there's you
33:00 - know there's a lot of different options
33:01 - but you you could probably find a
33:04 - component library or a single component
33:06 - that would do a lot of the work for you
33:09 - so I mean you definitely have some
33:12 - options there
33:13 - and then once you get through it you
33:17 - know once you have some code to go with
33:19 - you know you can always copy and paste
33:20 - and adapt it you know for for future
33:23 - projects so anyway that's my advice if
33:27 - you want a more specific advice and you
33:30 - have like a particular project you're
33:31 - working on now you know let me know send
33:33 - me a link to it or something to the code
33:35 - I I could check it out and help out so
33:37 - but just in general you know I'd say you
33:40 - know don't try to do it all from scratch
33:42 - if you don't have to
33:43 - you know definitely use some of those
33:46 - the resources that are available
33:50 - all right
33:53 - and
33:55 - there's a few more questions my timer
33:58 - went off but I'm just going to go
34:00 - through these last few questions that
34:02 - are on here this is I'm so close to the
34:04 - bottom
34:05 - the hopeless Brit s opinions on learning
34:09 - PHP versus learning JavaScript with node
34:11 - do you think we'll see PHP dropping off
34:14 - or do you think it will always be an
34:16 - item in
34:19 - it depends on what you want to do I
34:22 - think if you want to be well it if you
34:26 - want to be a front-end developer you
34:28 - must learn JavaScript JavaScript is
34:31 - everywhere no matter what's used in the
34:32 - backend
34:33 - if you want to do backend stuff though
34:37 - you don't have to go a node right PHP is
34:40 - still a valid option a lot of things use
34:43 - PHP it's not going anywhere anytime soon
34:45 - just WordPress alone the existence of
34:49 - WordPress and how popular it is I think
34:50 - guarantees PHP is going to be around for
34:53 - a while because WordPress runs on PHP
34:55 - and if you want to specialize in that
34:56 - then definitely learn PHP
34:58 - but
35:01 - what I'm doing
35:03 - and I I kind of recommend this unless
35:06 - for some reason you you know really like
35:08 - another back-end language is just go
35:11 - full stack JavaScript
35:13 - you know we don't have all the time in
35:16 - the world right people are busy you only
35:19 - have a certain amount of time to
35:20 - dedicate to learning so why not learn
35:23 - one language and be able to do front-end
35:24 - back-end right it's a lot easier so I
35:28 - mean that's the way I look at it so I'm
35:30 - focusing solely on JavaScript both front
35:32 - and back-end I do way more with the
35:34 - front-end but as you can see on these
35:37 - streams we still have to do some things
35:38 - with servers and form handling sending
35:41 - emails and things like that
35:43 - so we do work in the backend a bit
35:47 - but I think either one is still a valid
35:52 - option for back-end programming PHP or
35:55 - node
35:57 - I do see I don't know numbers but I get
36:01 - the feeling that
36:02 - using node on the backend is
36:06 - getting more popular I don't know if PHP
36:10 - is necessarily dropping off but I I
36:12 - don't get the feeling that is it is you
36:14 - know gaining more traction so that's
36:18 - just my feeling though from you know
36:21 - social media and articles and things I
36:23 - don't have any numbers on that so don't
36:24 - don't take that as for sure
36:27 - hopefully that answers your question
36:30 - Victor says being new to programming
36:33 - should I learn to program JavaScript
36:35 - before languages like Python alright so
36:38 - this kind of fits a little bit with the
36:40 - last question and I would say it all
36:42 - depends on what you want to do if you
36:45 - want to get into more stuff with the web
36:49 - JavaScript for sure if you're not sure
36:52 - what you want to do and maybe you're
36:54 - interested in I don't know like game
36:56 - development or
36:58 - data science or like machine learning I
37:03 - think Python is a great choice I don't
37:07 - know that much in Python but the little
37:09 - bit that I have you know done with it I
37:11 - enjoyed using Python the other option to
37:14 - consider is
37:17 - if there's a certain company you want to
37:18 - work for or a certain type of program
37:21 - you want to do you may want to do some
37:23 - research into what's used right if if
37:26 - you if the company you want to work for
37:28 - only uses Python no sense learning
37:31 - JavaScript right or it could be they
37:34 - could be using something else you know
37:35 - completely so once you weren't learn one
37:38 - language it is a lot easier to learn the
37:40 - second one so don't feel like you'll
37:43 - always be stuck with with that one it's
37:46 - you know programming is programming it's
37:50 - dropping from one language to another is
37:52 - mostly just learning new syntax
37:57 - all right netskope says yeah use
37:59 - bootstrap already so this was the
38:01 - question from earlier about navigation
38:03 - bars so netskope says I use bootstrap
38:05 - usually but sometimes you have a project
38:07 - at school we're not allowed to use this
38:09 - stuff and just need HTML CSS this is
38:11 - where I usually get stuck okay all right
38:14 - good that's a little bit more
38:16 - specific I would say this check out
38:20 - what's going on behind the scenes in
38:22 - bootstrap so look at one of your
38:23 - bootstrap projects where you have a
38:25 - navigation bar that looks kind of like
38:27 - how you want it to look on your your
38:30 - plain CSS project and
38:33 - go in dev tools inspect things and see
38:37 - what's the actual CSS behind those class
38:40 - names and then maybe you'll get an idea
38:42 - for for how it's done right
38:45 - you can take that then adapt it to what
38:49 - you need and
38:51 - I think that's a good way to see how
38:55 - they do it you can even try you know
38:57 - check out some other sites and see how
38:59 - they do it you know you'll find
39:01 - differences there's there's not just one
39:03 - way to to do it you know even the
39:06 - positioning of all the links and things
39:08 - there are several different ways in CSS
39:10 - that that could be done
39:12 - sometimes depending on what the menu
39:14 - does you know there may be JavaScript in
39:16 - use so that's what I would do just do
39:20 - some some dev tools inspecting and that
39:24 - should give you a give you an idea of of
39:27 - how different things are done
39:31 - all right
39:39 - there's
39:43 - all right let me a hardship is really
39:47 - excited about me installing this plug-in
39:48 - so let me install it really quick
39:53 - so command P and
39:57 - what are we gonna do and paste
40:07 - all right let's
40:22 - all right let's check it out that
40:25 - actually was really fast our shoot you
40:28 - were right
40:29 - where's our I
40:34 - think I have anything open in terms of
40:37 - directories oh here we are okay cool now
40:41 - we have some nice syntax highlighting
40:44 - with our queries
40:48 - awesome thanks argit
40:51 - that was super easy
40:55 - all right
40:59 - let's see
41:10 - alright well we actually
41:12 - we we did what I wanted to do and we
41:15 - finished it in one Pomodoro session so I
41:19 - mean I I thought it it was possible that
41:23 - we could do it but I
41:26 - we just did it really fast so I guess
41:30 - I'm gonna go through the live chat a bit
41:31 - if there's anything that anybody wants
41:34 - to see me actually do I in this project
41:37 - let me know otherwise I'm just going to
41:40 - do some live chat stuff this may end up
41:42 - being a short stream
41:43 - and unless I can think of something that
41:47 - would fit
41:48 - you know kind of with what we're doing
41:51 - but so we have a comment here from Basel
41:56 - and it says hello it says guys hello
41:58 - from Ukraine hey how's it going is it
42:02 - basil or basil how is it how is it
42:04 - pronounced let me know I want to make
42:06 - sure I pronounce it properly for you
42:09 - the hopeless bridge says I think it's
42:11 - always good to learn it without a
42:12 - framework first move on to learning
42:14 - frameworks for CSS and navigation stuff
42:18 - hopeless bread also says node is growing
42:21 - here in the UK and cheers for the
42:23 - response oh no problem hope hopefully it
42:27 - was helpful
42:29 - netskope says is it normal that I want
42:32 - to learn everything like web development
42:33 - app development game development etc
42:36 - yeah you know what I think that's normal
42:38 - especially if you're starting out
42:41 - something you said earlier you were in
42:43 - school so
42:45 - yeah I think that's that's normal you're
42:49 - not really gonna know what you want
42:51 - until I think you start to specialize
42:53 - and even then there's always going to be
42:56 - a part of you that says wow it would be
42:58 - cool to work with this so I mean I still
43:01 - do that I've been doing web development
43:02 - I
43:03 - don't know I've been a front-end
43:07 - developer here for two and a half years
43:10 - and then before that I was freelance for
43:12 - a few years and I there's still times
43:15 - when I read about you know some other
43:16 - new tech technology and I'm like wow
43:19 - that's really cool I want to get into
43:21 - that
43:23 - so
43:23 - but I'm happy with what I do you know
43:26 - you can't learn everything and you can't
43:29 - expect certainly can't be an expert at
43:31 - at more than you know one or two things
43:33 - at once unless you know maybe you're
43:36 - you're some type of one-in-a-million
43:37 - genius or something like that
43:40 - but even then someone who's a genius
43:43 - could always be better at one thing than
43:46 - at multiple things at once right that's
43:48 - that's what specialization does
43:51 - specialization is great because you get
43:52 - better at one thing but saying yes to
43:54 - that one thing means you're saying no to
43:56 - all the other things is you only have so
43:58 - many hours in the day but anyway at that
44:01 - point at this point though netskope I'd
44:03 - say try out a little bit of everything
44:06 - and figure out what you really like and
44:09 - then go into that and then you could
44:12 - always switch later on so you know don't
44:16 - feel like you got a I'm not saying you
44:18 - do feel like this but in case it happens
44:21 - don't feel like you you know you're
44:22 - gonna get trapped in one you know one
44:25 - area
44:27 - the horseshit says my first language was
44:29 - Java by the way oh cool
44:32 - haven't really done that much with Java
44:34 - for a long time once did a little game
44:37 - in Java though it was fun
44:43 - hopeless Britt says Java is great never
44:46 - really supported the fact that our uni
44:48 - made us learn both Java and then C++
44:51 - yeah when I the the one computer for a
44:54 - main course I took in college
44:57 - was
44:59 - C++
45:01 - made it calculators
45:04 - Mohan says hello from India looks like
45:08 - I'm a bit late to the party you know
45:10 - what I got finished with what I wanted
45:13 - to do so much earlier than I normally do
45:15 - mainly because
45:17 - everything worked
45:19 - North normally I messed something up and
45:22 - it takes a lot longer but everything
45:26 - worked this time so I'm happy that it
45:29 - worked but I guess it makes the live
45:31 - stream a little bit boring
45:36 - let's see the hopeless Britt says what
45:38 - do you often find more challenging /
45:41 - rewarding front-end back-end or
45:44 - full-stack I definitely for me at this
45:47 - point I think back-end is more
45:49 - challenging I've been doing front-end
45:52 - for longer and it's
45:53 - it's so visual I think it's really easy
45:57 - to see when you haven't got it right and
45:59 - when you got it you know you can just
46:01 - look and see alright that looks great or
46:04 - you can tell immediately that won't work
46:06 - that's terrible it looks awful back-end
46:09 - is not like that as much you know
46:11 - they're so
46:13 - coming from the front end and now trying
46:16 - to learn back end of course back end is
46:18 - is more challenging to me
46:21 - front end seems more rewarding though
46:25 - simply because you see your result at
46:28 - the end of the day and other people see
46:29 - it like I never have compliment somebody
46:31 - saying like oh you know you the back end
46:33 - on that app is just amazing no nobody
46:36 - says that they always say all the sites
46:38 - so beautiful it's so clean it's fast
46:41 - so the back end may have something to do
46:45 - with all that but people don't see it
46:47 - now if personally rewarding I do really
46:50 - like when I get something to work in in
46:53 - the backend because it's hard for me so
46:56 - it is rewarding in that sense I would
46:59 - love to be full-stack at some point I
47:02 - think it would be fun and provide you
47:04 - know for a lot of variety I'd also be
47:06 - able to you know complete you know
47:08 - create things you know completely on my
47:11 - own if possible I really do like working
47:13 - with other people especially with with
47:15 - you all on projects but if I really
47:18 - wanted to I could create a project on my
47:21 - own so I'm moving towards that direction
47:24 - I mean I think for those of you who
47:27 - watch the the stream you know for a
47:29 - while now I think you probably have seen
47:32 - more of a progression of you know us
47:34 - getting into more backend things so I've
47:37 - definitely come a long way you know just
47:39 - you know in the last year with that
47:42 - but you know for now I'm front is my
47:45 - thing
47:48 - actually that reminds me I talked with I
47:52 - was talking with somebody yesterday
47:54 - about learning management systems and
47:58 - they were talking about how there's just
48:01 - not a lot of good options out there
48:02 - especially for open source learning
48:04 - management systems and I know we've
48:07 - talked about it before on the stream but
48:08 - I think I really want to start working
48:11 - on a learning management system built
48:14 - with react full-stack JavaScript like
48:17 - progressive web app style right I may be
48:21 - there's something like that out there
48:22 - but I don't know about it yet I just
48:24 - think that would be very useful
48:25 - especially for you know
48:28 - companies just starting out they don't
48:31 - have a ton of money to be able to commit
48:32 - to one of like the big learning
48:34 - management systems I
48:36 - don't know I think it would be cool make
48:39 - something that's really fast can work
48:40 - offline
48:42 - you know just think how much like in
48:45 - countries that don't have reliable
48:46 - internet access like how nice would it
48:48 - be to be able to have a progressive web
48:51 - app as your learning management system
48:53 - so that like a non-profit could just use
48:56 - this open-source system
48:58 - you know in a lot of those places
49:01 - so you know people have cell phones you
49:04 - can just load it you know as a web page
49:09 - right and you know we could even do a
49:12 - you know an app with it if we wanted but
49:14 - loaded as a web page you know load up a
49:17 - lot of the stuff you need for the class
49:18 - so that when you don't have a connection
49:20 - it's right there you can do your tests
49:22 - and everything when you do get a
49:23 - connection everything just gets synced
49:25 - up oh yeah that would be really useful
49:28 - if someone knows or something like that
49:30 - that's already out there you know let me
49:32 - know I'd be happy to check it out or
49:35 - maybe even help contribute but if
49:36 - there's nothing like that right now I
49:38 - think that would be a really cool thing
49:39 - to work on so if anybody else thinks
49:41 - that would be cool to work on you know
49:43 - let me know I'm
49:45 - you know I'm busy I mean I think we're
49:48 - all kind of busy but that that's
49:50 - something important that I think it
49:51 - would be cool to make time for and could
49:53 - really help you know help out a lot of
49:55 - people
49:56 - so anyway
50:00 - you know I would need
50:04 - probably I
50:07 - mean obviously like front-end design
50:10 - stuff I got that a lot of the react
50:13 - things you know I have that but this
50:15 - would be something where you know you
50:17 - would need it connected with a database
50:19 - and I'm I'm not great with databases you
50:22 - know we would need some type of login
50:24 - system user authentication
50:26 - we definitely want it to be secure right
50:29 - there's gonna be
50:30 - student records and things so there's
50:34 - going to be a lot of areas where I'm
50:35 - just not gonna have the knowledge and
50:37 - it's probably not the best use of my
50:39 - time to try to get better in those areas
50:42 - if that's not really my thing right now
50:45 - if I have to I have to but if anybody
50:48 - out there knows more about that and
50:50 - wants to help you know
50:54 - let me know I think it'd be a cool
50:56 - project so maybe I'll make a repo for it
50:58 - soon you know just so that we could
51:01 - you'll get started get some ideas start
51:03 - talking about it
51:04 - alright I'm going to go back to the I'm
51:07 - gonna go back to the live chat now and
51:09 - answer some more your your questions
51:17 - Lucas says good afternoon my friend good
51:20 - afternoon thanks for watching rook says
51:23 - what does the with rude higher-order
51:26 - component actually do something with
51:27 - styles let's see
51:34 - with root component where we get
51:45 - where am I missing that
51:50 - was that what it was called
51:59 - there are my components there we go
52:03 - yeah so let's check this component out
52:07 - we're bringing in our styles go with
52:10 - your background
52:11 - [Music]
52:16 - all right yes so this is wrapping our
52:19 - our mui themed provider is from
52:22 - obviously material UI
52:24 - so this is wrapping everything you know
52:28 - within our app in there and then
52:32 - yeah we got a lot of other stuff going
52:34 - on
52:35 - with our styles which
52:40 - I'm not even sure I'm assuming this is a
52:43 - lot of the stuff I think are she did
52:45 - this I'm assuming this is a lot of the
52:46 - setup from the material UI Doc's on how
52:50 - to bring in
52:53 - on how to bring this stuff in but
52:56 - basically yet what it's doing is just
52:57 - making sure that all the material UI
53:00 - theme stuff is available in our
53:02 - components
53:10 - ours it says as project is getting to
53:13 - completion what is your deployment plan
53:14 - will you be using digitalocean site now
53:17 - is getting really good you can scale to
53:19 - multiple servers on one command with
53:21 - managing servers I you know what would
53:25 - have to think more about that but I I
53:31 - don't think I'm gonna go with
53:34 - digitalocean I think
53:37 - maybe AWS so Amazon Web Services or I'm
53:42 - open to something like using using site
53:45 - I've I've done some side projects on
53:48 - site and I do really like it it's really
53:50 - easy so
53:52 - I'm gonna have to reassess yeah it's
53:55 - been a couple months since I first came
53:56 - up with a deployment plan we actually
53:59 - even before that I started planning it
54:01 - out you know a year ago
54:03 - so maybe I should reassess before I
54:07 - really have to launch and see you know
54:09 - is the plan that I came up with before
54:11 - still the best way to do it maybe not
54:15 - maybe there's better a way to do it now
54:16 - that you know that I either didn't know
54:18 - about or didn't exist before
54:21 - so I'm glad you brought that up
54:27 - it would definitely be helpful to be
54:30 - able to scale things up with a command
54:32 - instead of managing multiple servers so
54:33 - that's a really good point hard
54:40 - yeah whatever we do we just have to make
54:42 - sure it has all the functionality that
54:44 - we that we need which really I mean we
54:48 - don't even have contact forms on the
54:50 - site right now so it's actually gonna be
54:53 - pretty basic so I
54:56 - just want it to be fast whatever we do
54:59 - it just needs to be fast and reliable
55:21 - see
55:22 - the hopeless bridge says great job with
55:25 - that sequel and PHP very true you never
55:30 - hear that I
55:35 - don't remember what I said the hopeless
55:37 - Brit I don't remember what I said that
55:39 - that comment is is directed toward
55:47 - let's see hopeless spirit said I have to
55:49 - say I think projects like Khan Academy
55:51 - gave me my inspiration to move towards
55:54 - the full stack developer side of things
56:00 - cool you know what I actually haven't
56:02 - looked at Khan Academy for years
56:05 - I'm gonna have to check that out and see
56:08 - what they have available on the site
56:10 - even for my own kids I think maybe it'd
56:13 - be useful
56:18 - all right in regard to this component
56:21 - this with route Harshit says it server
56:25 - renders material UI stylesheet and
56:27 - classes using JSS okay and then reuses
56:32 - the context on the client all right that
56:33 - makes a lot more sense
56:35 - as I was looking at this I kept thinking
56:38 - this is a lot more setup than we've used
56:40 - before with the theory you I and that
56:43 - totally makes sense now so to be able to
56:45 - use material you I with our server-side
56:48 - rendering and on the client side then
56:51 - that's where a lot of this stuff had had
56:53 - to happen so thanks for clarifying that
56:56 - hard
57:02 - dragster says I have a question can I
57:05 - use react without node J s
57:09 - I guess I believe you can I have never
57:13 - done it but
57:15 - right correct me if I'm wrong but you
57:17 - can it you can use react without node
57:19 - right
57:22 - because you can use reacts client-side
57:26 - right
57:28 - okay he's saying right I don't want to
57:30 - say anything wrong so let me know if I'm
57:32 - wrong but I'm pretty sure you use react
57:35 - without note and if I you can use it
57:37 - just client-side if you want to
57:53 - I should also says you don't need to
57:55 - manage the SSL's if you use it-- that's
57:58 - cool I'm not really worried about the
57:59 - SSL it's kind of you know once you set
58:02 - it up and set up the Auto renew it's
58:05 - it's not that hard you know it's only it
58:07 - you know less than an hour set up but
58:09 - that is cool that it manages it
58:12 - although that might be an issue I know
58:15 - because the IT department purchased some
58:18 - SSL with all this insurance or something
58:20 - for the main site and
58:23 - they may want us to try to use those
58:26 - certs I I don't know we'll see how that
58:29 - goes
58:33 - all right hopeless bridge says Khan
58:36 - Academy is such an amazing platform plus
58:38 - you can find a lot of their learning
58:39 - tools are open source very cool I'm
58:42 - definitely have to check that out
58:45 - hopeless bridge said they for sure gave
58:48 - the site a facelift could be a lot
58:49 - faster though
58:55 - yeah I really think a good learning
58:57 - management system should be fast right
59:00 - that the slowness of the system could
59:03 - definitely distract the learner right so
59:07 - I
59:08 - mean speed is speed is important for
59:10 - every site but I think it's very
59:11 - important for that I mean there's
59:13 - already someone who's trying to learn
59:16 - something already has to fight
59:17 - distraction so much to be able to focus
59:19 - you know you don't want to cause them
59:21 - more distraction by either having a
59:23 - terrible UI or having your site be
59:25 - really slow
59:27 - so I think yeah like the
59:30 - it you know if you design it right off
59:33 - the bat with that in mind I think you
59:36 - could definitely have something that's
59:37 - really
59:40 - that runs really quickly
59:46 - it's not
59:51 - hard sang
59:53 - Zeit automatically uses HTTP - very cool
59:57 - it says the katha catechol site has a
59:59 - good speed and it's not using HTTP -
60:03 - yeah the katha catechol site is fast I
60:06 - mean way faster than some of the other
60:10 - university sites that
60:12 - were made before I started working here
60:15 - all right cool Arsen says you can use
60:17 - custom shirts was i all right that's
60:19 - cool I'm not worried about it I don't I
60:22 - think we'd be fine with you know let's
60:26 - encrypt free certification or you know
60:29 - SSL certs
60:31 - but I don't know we'll see I mean you
60:35 - know how things are sometimes
60:37 - you know if if that cert was already
60:40 - purchased for I don't know years in
60:42 - advance
60:43 - that's not gonna look good for the IT
60:46 - department if you know anybody higher up
60:48 - found out like oh you paid all this
60:50 - money for the search you're not even
60:52 - using them you know you did it for free
60:53 - so you know just to like kind of help
60:56 - them out it might be better just to use
60:58 - them and then maybe when they expire
61:00 - switch over or something
61:02 - but I don't know what the case is all
61:04 - have to talk to them and see exactly
61:06 - what's going on
61:08 - trying to think too if they have it I
61:10 - mean they may have it be applied to
61:13 - other like subdomains - I'm not sure
61:15 - what what's going on with that I wasn't
61:17 - involved
61:18 - that much in
61:21 - the pro mean I encourage them to get is
61:24 - an SSL certificate but I wasn't that
61:27 - much involved in actually you know
61:29 - purchasing it and you know applying it
61:32 - it was I don't really know that much
61:34 - about iis servers anyway so that wasn't
61:38 - my thing
61:45 - Harshit says you should enable HTTP to
61:49 - HTTPS
61:50 - ooh and nginx settings and catechetical
61:52 - site
61:54 - all right that's cool
61:56 - I'll definitely have to look that up I
62:00 - hadn't even thought of it but I should
62:03 - do that yeah I I do as you all know I
62:05 - mentioned I do want to make some updates
62:07 - to the cata catechol site I've been
62:10 - working on it we updated a bunch of
62:12 - packages on the stream
62:14 - but I need to switch over the videos not
62:18 - working anymore now that I updated so
62:20 - I'm gonna switch that up to YouTube
62:22 - instead of JW player and try to get it
62:25 - to work like that and I need to make
62:28 - some other changes to the UI we're gonna
62:30 - add some contact forms and things so
62:33 - there's definitely more work that needs
62:35 - to be done and in that process of doing
62:37 - all that I think that would be a great
62:39 - time to update some more things
62:43 - including using HTTP to update packages
62:46 - on the server you know a lot a lot of
62:48 - things like that
62:59 - Harshit says but if they purchased did
63:02 - you sort use that it has what is that a
63:05 - million insurance or something I don't
63:06 - know how many zeros are there yeah
63:08 - million yeah like I've said yeah if they
63:11 - already purchased it
63:13 - then I'll use the they're purchased
63:16 - certificate but I would like to know
63:19 - like how much time is left on it if they
63:21 - only have a few months before it expires
63:22 - then do we really need that
63:26 - we're not taking anybody's payment
63:28 - information we're not even having a user
63:30 - login or anything like that I do we
63:33 - really need the insurance I don't know
63:36 - off to look into it the hopeless Brit
63:39 - asks so if you've got any experience
63:42 - with laravel I think if I ever was to
63:44 - learn PHP framework it would be larva I
63:46 - personally have no experience with
63:48 - laravel but I I hear about it I see
63:51 - articles about it things so I think
63:54 - that's probably a good way to go if you
63:56 - do want to do PHP you know larvell seems
63:59 - like the way to go
64:02 - but I don't really I don't know that
64:05 - much about it I just know that I see it
64:07 - mentioned a lot
64:10 - all right whoa
64:13 - I
64:15 - think been streaming for about an hour
64:18 - so decent length stream anyway I got
64:23 - through all the live chat now so which
64:25 - end up being a
64:27 - really good chat I love it a lot of
64:30 - great questions got some great info as
64:32 - well
64:33 - so I really appreciate all that I think
64:37 - I'm gonna wrap things up
64:39 - so I should be back tomorrow I'm gonna
64:42 - try to do things stream over around 1
64:45 - p.m. I think that's seems to be a good
64:48 - time for a lot of you you know that are
64:52 - watching from different time zones
64:56 - yeah so anyway thanks for watching today
65:00 - and
65:01 - until tomorrow have a great day
