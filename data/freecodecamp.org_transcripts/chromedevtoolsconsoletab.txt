00:00 - okay so we are back on my code pen with
00:02 - a different quote but this time we are
00:04 - on the console tab of developer tools
00:07 - now i don't have any examples to show
00:08 - you right now of console i'm not going
00:10 - to spend a ton of time on console either
00:12 - um
00:13 - because it's pretty similar to how your
00:14 - console runs on your computer which i've
00:16 - talked about in other videos
00:19 - it's a good way to get administrative
00:20 - messages it also has some alerts you can
00:22 - build into your code console log in your
00:25 - javascript will put it in this chrome
00:27 - console
00:28 - there is something really cool that you
00:30 - can do whenever there is information in
00:31 - the console
00:33 - it's um dot table console.table
00:37 - let's see
00:39 - now there's not anything in here right
00:41 - now but it
00:42 - if there was any data in there it sorts
00:44 - it out makes it really easy to look at
00:46 - that's something that i really do like
00:48 - about console so since this is loading
00:50 - all of my zip lines on codepen
00:53 - all of these little zip lines had
00:56 - console logging messages and since
00:57 - they're all being loaded in their own
00:59 - little windows all of those messages are
01:01 - loading right now so if we look at this
01:03 - one
01:05 - that's my location and the response for
01:08 - this object
01:10 - it's it's all that information it's in
01:12 - the console which is a really awesome
01:14 - tool i especially like it when i'm
01:16 - getting information from an api i want
01:18 - to view everything in that api so i can
01:20 - figure out what key i need to reference
01:22 - later
01:23 - there are about 100 gazillion ways to
01:25 - use the console effectively and just
01:27 - like everything else you have to figure
01:29 - out what works best for you and what you
01:30 - use the most i want to stress one more
01:32 - time to check out chrome dev tools
01:36 - let's find the console panel this is
01:38 - what the page looks like for the
01:39 - documentation it is so easy to use check
01:42 - it out
