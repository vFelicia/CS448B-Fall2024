00:00 - so what do programmers actually do
00:04 - let's look at the wiki definition of a
00:07 - programmer computer programmer is a
00:10 - person
00:11 - that creates computer software and what
00:14 - is computer software
00:16 - computer software is a set of data or
00:20 - computer instructions that tell the
00:22 - computer what to do
00:25 - let's take wikipedia as an example
00:28 - wikipedia needs software engineers to
00:30 - make sure that when you and i open the
00:34 - same article to edit it we can actually
00:36 - collaborate on it and the changes that
00:39 - you made won't be erased when i click
00:41 - the save or added button wikipedia needs
00:44 - a set of software engineers to maintain
00:47 - its databases all over the world because
00:50 - believe it or not wikipedia has
00:53 - around 6 million articles so we need to
00:57 - make sure that all of that can be
00:59 - maintained and be robust wikipedia needs
01:02 - to make sure that the front end of the
01:05 - website looks the way the designers have
01:09 - implemented so it needs a set of
01:10 - front-end engineers to do that wikipedia
01:13 - also needs to make sure that when you
01:17 - i
01:18 - millions of people around the world open
01:21 - millions and millions of articles
01:24 - wikipedia doesn't crash it's fast and
01:27 - it's able to maintain that huge overload
01:31 - software engineers solve problems and to
01:35 - solve a problem x they use coding as a
01:39 - tool so essentially software engineers
01:42 - are problem solvers and to solve a
01:45 - problem x the programmer needs to
01:48 - understand the problem they need to
01:50 - understand the context around the
01:52 - problem they very much need to
01:54 - understand the constraints of the system
01:56 - surrounding the problem and they of
01:58 - course deeply need to understand why
02:01 - they're solving the problem they're
02:03 - solving it might go something like this
02:05 - i work as a software engineer at airbnb
02:09 - and let's say airbnb wants to develop
02:12 - the wishlist feature to develop this
02:14 - wishlist feature i as a backend engineer
02:17 - would be responsible for all the
02:19 - underlying logic that you the user do
02:22 - not see but that is how the system works
02:25 - so when you heart a house on airbnb
02:29 - i need to make sure that this house is
02:32 - going to be associated with the wishlist
02:35 - list that you as a user create and that
02:38 - this list in and of itself needs to be
02:41 - associated with my user accounts and
02:44 - that this list is going to be saved in
02:47 - the database the house will be saved in
02:50 - the list in the database and associated
02:53 - with my account i need to make sure that
02:55 - when you unhard the house it's going to
02:58 - be removed from my wish list and removed
03:01 - from the association with my user
03:04 - account all that is what i as a back-end
03:06 - engineer would be responsible for a
03:09 - front-end engineer will work closely
03:11 - with me because they need to know what
03:13 - is the underlying logic for this feature
03:16 - as well as with a designer who will
03:18 - propose the designs of how it will
03:21 - actually look like on the platform and
03:24 - then all of us together will also work
03:26 - probably with the data scientists
03:28 - because a data scientist will actually
03:30 - analyze how successful was this feature
03:34 - should should it be something that we
03:35 - should keep on the platform so we would
03:37 - implement logging to track how
03:41 - popular the feature is how many users
03:43 - use it are they happy with it is the
03:45 - button color all right
03:47 - so all of us will work as a team on this
03:52 - i hope this shed some light on what
03:54 - programmers actually do and if you like
