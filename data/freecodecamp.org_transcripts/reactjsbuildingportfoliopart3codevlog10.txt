01:24 - appropriately just only when clicked and
01:26 - this portfolio will be single page using

01:42 - better the one at which you are standing
01:44 - or the one at which you are sitting I
01:46 - use both of them but the best desk is
01:49 - the desk from which you stand up very
01:51 - often and go go out in order to stretch
01:54 - a bit your muscles

04:10 - it's a step farther because more people
04:13 - are going to take part than the last
04:15 - time this week I was learning a lot
04:17 - about react and I have just touched the
04:21 - basics of react for developers who are
04:24 - programming in react for a long time
04:27 - it's like nothing what I did did despite
04:30 - the fact that it's a small step I really
04:33 - appreciate that I managed to do it this
04:35 - week each step counts especially if you
04:38 - learn something from scratch you started
04:41 - you did it you Ed the first sympath of
04:44 - react code in your app in your
04:48 - website and everything works and
04:51 - everything is fine so now you can go the
04:54 - step farther so making small steps
04:59 - but in the direction of
05:01 - progress It's always what motivates me
05:05 - this is how the page looks right
05:10 - now since the last week I changed the
05:13 - pattern uh here behind the the colors I
05:16 - created my own pattern in this section
05:19 - of uh
05:20 - repositories and I also added the pages
05:23 - that are loading
05:25 - here
05:27 - dynamically so
05:31 - I chose few
05:33 - [Music]
05:34 - applications one website right now and
05:39 - uh one example from design I load these
05:42 - portfolio sub Pages using reacts I use
05:45 - routing to as you see the link uh
05:49 - changes dynamically look here we have
05:53 - applications website and design I tried
05:57 - the first time to load this sub Pages
05:58 - this way using
06:00 - react it wasn't easy at first uh I found
